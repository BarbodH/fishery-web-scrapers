1032028,woodenboater,2018-08-01 00:05:00,2277,yup. turn left at Verner and yer back on 64. Takes you right past Lakair  was thinking of Totem in a couple of weeks but guess that's now on hold.
1032030,SirCranksalot,2018-08-01 00:32:00,3291,"We were in the Otter Bay & Five Finger area last week and we could see and smell the smoke at times but, IMO, was quite tolerable.---blue haze in the dist and intermittent smell depending on wind direction.  Today would not be one of the better days though "
1032036,Chuck Enwinde,2018-08-01 05:10:00,247,Looks like some wet weather is heading that way on the radar.  Pray it doesn't miss.
1032038,AKRISONER,2018-08-01 12:50:00,5558,"its breaking up a little as rain tends to when it hits very very dry land. The land literally evaporates the moisture out of the atmosphere. At least one good thing is that areas just to the south like britt, pointe au baril and byng inlet are getting some of the rain. Although this fire is concerning, what was scaring the hell out of me was the possibility that another fire could spark in the region which would require the resources from Parry Sound 33 to have to start fighting another fire. That's the last thing that area needs. When you observe the radar closely, you can really see how dry the stretch between pointe au baril and the french river is dry as a bone...you can literally see the rain evaporating in that stretch as soon as it hits the land."
1032049,DRIFTER_016,2018-08-01 14:46:00,10439,Hope it's nowhere near as bad as it was here in 2014. The only road South was closed for long stretches due to smoke and fires near the road. At one point a dozer crew had to run for their lives when the fire front came blasting through at 40+ MPH. It was so hot it melted the asphalt where it crossed the road.  When it finally rained this is what fell from the sky. 
1032112,lew,2018-08-02 14:00:00,12766,Here's the latest update. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/forest-fire-august-2-1.4770390
1032203,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-04 04:11:00,8243,"Stopped by Buddy's property today and see a livestock trailer parked outside Dunnville ON. His son and family evacuated the area of the French and could only bring the Family, 2 dogs and 6 Calves from the farm. They may have lost their home and 80 acre farm and 100 livestock. He is a mess. They are staying in a pop up. We read and hear of these things on the radio and TV but never think it can have happen to those we care about. He is one of our hard working farmers and has no idea what to do or the fate of his liveststock. All the help lines give a busy signal. What a cluster jamb. I can't imagine what I would do in the same situation, can't fathom it. A real time nightmare. "
1032206,SirCranksalot,2018-08-04 12:38:00,3291,The fire has not crossed 69 so I don't think any farms have been burnt out. I think all the farms are E of 69. That area was evacuated as a precaution though. The latest reports seem to say  that the crews are gradually getting it under control
1032208,lew,2018-08-04 13:04:00,12766,Those guys & gals have been busting their butts non-stop for a couple weeks now and doing an outstanding job bringing that blaze under control.
1032211,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-04 14:36:00,8243,Those folks holding back fires across the World are tough as nails.
1032212,woodenboater,2018-08-04 15:12:00,2277,you want to read about smoke jumpers and the risks they take ? read Young Men and Fire by Norman MacLean (he of A River Runs Through It).
1032223,chris.brock,2018-08-04 19:44:00,4053,"A co-worker of mine was a smoke jumper when he was younger. Aside from the danger factor, pretty much the whole summer is gone, it's spent working, long shifts, away from home. In a busy summer, the money he earned was less than I expected too. He said his last summer, he was sitting in a bog, getting destroyed by mosquitoes, soaked in sweat waiting for a helicopter for hours, and he just said ""to hell with this crap"""
1032226,SirCranksalot,2018-08-04 21:07:00,3291,What's not to like?? Sounds pretty easy compared to portaging in to a 'back lake' to find trout. Just ask your friend  the Bogerman!! ??
1032239,SirCranksalot,2018-08-05 14:28:00,3291,It looks likethey are gradually getting it under control. Must be brutally hot out there on a day like today. They must hose each other down occasionally!?  https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/fighting-hard-excellent-progress-made-on-parry-sound-33-fire-even-on-a-hot-weekend-1006747

1032310,leaf4,2018-08-07 11:48:00,2466,Hopefully the rain we're getting in the GTA is also making it's way up North and helping things out up with the firefighting efforts
1032311,AKRISONER,2018-08-07 13:14:00,5558,"the area that had the fire received rain the last two days, it wasnt enough to do a ton, but it didnt hurt, especially sunday during the wicked storm that rolled through, they got a very very heavy downpour for a good half an hour. Lets continue to hope for more rain, areas to the south i.e. britt, pointe au baril, skerryvore, shawanaga are still extremely dry...as is the entire area to the north at the french...we need like a week of rain up there to reset. The extreme fire danger may not leave until the fall to be honest."
1032391,Hack_Fisherman,2018-08-09 10:26:00,720,Good news finally about parry sound 33. They have made good progress and Some residents were allowed to return home

1031948,AKRISONER,2018-07-30 14:22:00,5558,"they were blasting as well in the area and had sparked up a few fires earlier in the week. Not a great look, now that the fire is >8000 hectars with no rain in sight."
1031949,lew,2018-07-30 14:33:00,12766,Here's a smoke advisory for the area. https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/alerts/high-alert/ontario/sturgeon-falls
1031953,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-30 14:50:00,720,They are putting in a wind farm in the reserve. I heard they got a piece of machinery stuck in the bush that sparked a fire. Can’t say if is truth
1031954,SirCranksalot,2018-07-30 14:56:00,3291,We were up near Dokis last week and it got quite smoky at times. Could smell it and see it
1031957,Dan668,2018-07-30 15:51:00,1120,"I was in the area this week on the french, couldnt handle the smoke, came back home. SW winds for a few days straight blowing smoke right in."
1031960,SirCranksalot,2018-07-30 18:16:00,3291,"What area of the French were you in? We were a bit W of Woseley Bay(Gee, I wish they'd give those area lake names--they really are lakes!!i  pic from yesterday https://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/modis.php?region=h&amp;page=1&amp;template=sub&amp;image=a1.18210.1843.LakeHuron.143.250m.jpg "
1031961,Dan668,2018-07-30 18:38:00,1120,"I was in Wolseley Bay. Thanks for the link, can visibly see the smoke."
1031986,woodenboater,2018-07-31 02:59:00,2277,"Man the smoke was pretty good on a stretch of 69 today. Saw some helos based in a field in Britt, guessing they were for monitoring, didn't see any buckets. If the winds keep coming in from the bay, can't see how 69 stays open much longer since it was only 6kms from the asphalt today."
1031992,AKRISONER,2018-07-31 12:14:00,5558,"probably didnt see the choppers with the buckets because they were out fighting the fires! Britt has become the new base for fighting them. A local farmer donated his fields for the effort. Its crazy to think of how close all of this is, i snowmobile through this area all of the time...so sad."
1031994,wkrp,2018-07-31 13:23:00,656,Planning to go to Wolsley Bay on the weekend. Does anyone have specific info on the conditions there?
1031995,Dan668,2018-07-31 13:28:00,1120,"It was very smokey on Saturday when i arrived. I went straight home. I cancelled two weeks worth of bookings and lost my deposit. One on Wolseley Bay, the other on the West Arm. My dad has a heart condition so I'm sure it's not good for him. Trying to salvage the second week, calling everywhere, difficult as it's a long weekend. The air quality statement is still up, winds still from the SW so smoke will continue. They just issued an evaluation alert for the town of Alban today, thats the lower french. Fires still out of control so who knows."
1031996,lew,2018-07-31 13:37:00,12766,I mentioned earlier that my daughter is heading up thru that area in 11 days and she's joining us on the West Arm of Nippissing which isn't too far from the fire area. Keeping fingers crossed that they get everything under control soon. Not concerned about the fire reaching that far but the heavy smoke can be miserable. I live in the Kawarthas and remember a few years back we had a very heavy smell of smoke here and it turns out it was coming from fires all the way over in Minnesota or Wisconsin.
1031997,AKRISONER,2018-07-31 14:04:00,5558,"ya...id be looking to go elsewhere  southwest winds this weekend too, you will be in for a miserable time. If you can even get there with the pending evacuation. "
1032001,Rodnreel,2018-07-31 14:28:00,11,"My property is on Hartley Bay rd. Mandatory evacuation this morning.  There is potential that they shut down the highway later today due to heavy smoke. I was there this past weekend, and the air quality was terrible."
1032004,AKRISONER,2018-07-31 14:45:00,5558,"all the best to you man...i couldnt imagine, im worried enough down in Pointe Au Baril...were all hoping for rain."
1032005,lew,2018-07-31 14:58:00,12766,"Yeah, best of luck for you & your place, lousy situation to be in and hopefully it all works out for you guys in the area. I guess if they shut down 69 the only alternative will be way over to 11 and cut thru North Bay ?"
1032006,DRIFTER_016,2018-07-31 15:10:00,10439, A crew of our bombers from the NWT are working down in Ontario now. Been a very wet year up here and very few fires so far. 
1032015,wkrp,2018-07-31 20:22:00,656,Just called the lodge and its business as usual.
1032017,AKRISONER,2018-07-31 20:36:00,5558,"...except that the area is filled with smoke and theres the chance that highway 69 is borderline about to be closed... The guy isnt going to tell you not to come until the evacuation is actually in effect. His business would be taking a beating because of all of this.  I am not going to tell you not to go, but if you do, expect heavy smoke, like very very heavy smoke...if you or anyone going with you has respiratory issues, i would very strongly advise you to not go. Be prepared for the potential for highway 69 to be closed at any moment and having to find an alternative way home i.e. running north to sudbury and then east to northbay back down 11. Last but not least, be prepared to be ordered to evacuate at any moment. Grundy lake PP was evacuated over the weekend they sent 800 campers home 10km to the south of where you are headed."
1032018,BillM,2018-07-31 21:03:00,17367,Alban is under evacuation soon as well from what I've been hearing..  Scary stuff.
1032019,Dan668,2018-07-31 21:14:00,1120,"I wouldn't bother based on what i seen, but like Akrisoner stated expect smoke. Winds are staying the same direction which isnt good for the area. I drove up and came back home the same day. The smoke is terrible, i laughed when one lodge owner said its not that bad, and when the other was mad because there losing my business. Not going to risk my families health over a fish. They wont tell you a thing, not even a courtesy call."
1032023,Rich Clemens,2018-07-31 22:41:00,3131,"They just put Alban on evacuation alert, which is just after turning off route 69 on to 64.   I think this is due to the smoke coming from the Key River fire.   Keep up to date on conditions.   If the smoke gets too bad, they could shut dow 69.      We're heading up that way September 8. - should be taken care of by then.   I sure hope"
1032024,Rich Clemens,2018-07-31 22:45:00,3131,"I've seen a couple Facebook posts from groups in the area recommending coming up 11 to north bay, then taking 17 west towards Sudbury.   Will add maybe 45-60 minutes depending on where you are going.  May be a small price to pay vs. getting all the way up there and the  have to find an alternative route"
1032025,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-31 22:59:00,720,Best of luck to you. I hope they and mother nature can knock this one into submission.
1031629,Headhunter,2018-07-24 13:46:00,5703,"As most of us are aware, central Ontario is under siege of fire, with folks being evacuated from their homes from Parry Sound to Sudbury. I thought it might be a good idea to keep a thread open on this topic as many of us are intending to head in that direction in the coming weeks. Any insight that can passed along from folks local to the scene or those who have traveled in the area, I think would be useful to us all. Not going to worry at this time about who is or isn't responsible, more interested in how this affecting both locals and those visiting the areas. Here's a link to the governments web site with up to date info. https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires HH"

1031636,AKRISONER,2018-07-24 15:31:00,5558,"was in Pointe Au Baril this past weekend and the situation is downright scary up there...I feel so much for the people affected in the key/french river areas. The smoke on the horizon and smell was enough to instill fear in everyone in pointe au baril's hearts. It is everyone's responsibilities to be extremely diligent, to protect one another's property and well being. If you are in the vast vast area that is now considered to be under a total fire ban, please THINK! This means aside from the obvious no fires... It also means, no fireworks, and no throwing ciggarette butts on the ground! My parents this past weekend witnessed an individual in parry sound riding a motorcycle toss his butt in the ditch, i also personally witnessed individuals lighting fireworks, while the fires visibly raged 20 miles to our north. If you are in the township of the archipelago and witness someone violating a fire ban, you may contact by law enforcement at the followign numbers By Law enforcement 705-746-4243 ext 325 or after hours 705-774-3630"
1031637,OhioFisherman,2018-07-24 15:33:00,6623,"Wow, hope some of the rain we got makes it north!"
1031641,lew,2018-07-24 15:52:00,12766,"What was the response from by-law when you called them, did they come out ?"
1031642,AKRISONER,2018-07-24 16:10:00,5558,unfortunately I was around the point from where the fireworks were being launched so i was unable to pinpoint the exact location they were coming from.  I could hear the individuals chatting and yelling and then fireworks launching in the sky. I came around the point and everything had gone quiet and dark. Either someone spoke to them already or they knew what they were doing was wrong and hid it. I wish i could have went after them myself... I was bloody raging...you could see the smoke in the sky from the fires just to our north and these idiots think its awesome to light fireworks...ugh I have been personally assured by the township that any reporting of the fireban violation will be responded to. That after hours number is for the local by law enforcements personal phone line.

1031649,Reef Runner,2018-07-24 17:39:00,980,Very sad to see. Pickerel and the French were my yearly getaways later into fall for ski's.  Rented a nice cabin on the Key just last summer.  Hope all in the community are fairing as best they can.  
1031651,AKRISONER,2018-07-24 18:14:00,5558,"from what i can see, the firefighters have done a friggin incredible job containing the blaze to the forest and away from most of the cottages thus far...there is obviously is devestation, but i believe they were able to save the key marina area...which i friggin incredible because the fire basically surrounded the entirety of the community there. some of the footage of the water bombers sweeping in on the henvey inlet is crazy, the pilots of those planes are friggin next level."
1031654,Reef Runner,2018-07-24 19:00:00,980,Good to hear Akri.  The lady at the little shop above the launch at Key river was always pleasant and hospitable.  On a long haul back down to Toronto they let us check into one of their cabins after hours just left the lights on for us to lay our heads down and settle up in the morning.  Good folks out that way!
1031659,Lord Letto,2018-07-24 21:13:00,70,"Hopefully things turn out OK, for the people living there, businesses & the fishery/wildlife. I've been to the French (Alban/Noelville area) a few times with the family & loved it, we weren't able to make it there this year but hopefully once things improve for us we could maybe go next year or the year after."
1031660,Fisherman,2018-07-24 21:28:00,7201,"From the news it appears it may have been caused by rock blasting in the area,  couple of the employees said there were small fires after the blasting."
1031662,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-24 22:31:00,720,I heard it was caused  By a US  wind power company that got a piece of machinery stuck

1031671,Chuck Enwinde,2018-07-25 04:28:00,247,Tha That has to be some welcomed news.  Poured hard here in the GTA today as well.  Hopefully all points between got some too.
1031676,AKRISONER,2018-07-25 12:23:00,5558,"unfortunately the rain missed a lot of the parry sound and french river region. The britt area got poured on, but unfortunately the french and pointe au baril areas missed out entirely. The extended forecast doesnt look so great either."
1031769,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-26 15:35:00,2585,The cigarette butt thing is an important one.  Last weekend a friend threw his butt into my campfire pit that had some brush in it that fell from trees from the storm a couple weeks ago and it was going to be burned then the fire ban started.  Anyway I was in the screen in porch and smelt camp fire smoke and when I went out my fire pit was lit up.  If it can happen in a fire pit with a few small branches it will happen in the bush!  Be safe everyone! Cheers!  
1031941,Headhunter,2018-07-30 13:11:00,5703,Just bumping this to the top as the fires are still going and they are getting closer to the highway according to the latest news I have heard. Anyone with updates are welcome to chime in. HH
1031942,AKRISONER,2018-07-30 13:22:00,5558,a firefighter from Alberta has perished on the job in Northwestern Ontario Heavy winds all weekend up on the northeast side of Georgian Bay has made the Parry Sound 33 fire spark up big time over the weekend. No rain in sight...not looking good at all.
1031944,lew,2018-07-30 13:23:00,12766,My daughter's getting a bit concerned as she's gonna be travelling up 69 right by the fire zone in about 12 days so hopefully they get it knocked down by then.
