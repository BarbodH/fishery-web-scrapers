I'd shut it off, restart it and it'd work for about 10 minutes and start again. Transducer and cable are good as is power supply and voltage. I've reduced the sensitivity as per the manual and still doesn't work for more than a few minutes. Lowrance is recommending a software update and a reset. Any thoughts from my learned fishermen?"
1031979,spincast,2018-07-30 23:40:00,3279,original transducer?  They do fail over time.  Know anyone where you could plug the head into their ducer? That'll at least tell you if its in the head or somewhere else.
