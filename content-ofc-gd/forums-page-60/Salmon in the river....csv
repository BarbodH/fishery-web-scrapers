1031895,Fish frames,2018-07-29 03:03:00,36,Stopped off at the ladder and can it be salmon already?? 
1031903,dave524,2018-07-29 12:15:00,4508,Don't Atlantics spawn late summer  ????
1031911,Rizzo,2018-07-29 16:38:00,4754,wow I didn't know salmon came up this early
1031912,BillM,2018-07-29 16:45:00,17367,"Big rain always gets a push of fish, even in summer.   Kinda crazy.   I'm guessing it will drop back to the lake eventually."
1031913,Fisherman,2018-07-29 16:45:00,7201,"Rip van Winkle,  years ago we had salmon come up in the Notty as early as mid June, normally around this time is quite common."
1031915,misfish,2018-07-29 17:42:00,29133,"When you hear a knock on the door, duck, Im going to slap ya."
1031917,Fisherman,2018-07-29 19:53:00,7201,"Hahahaha,  bear spray handy,  potato gun loaded...."
1031940,craigdritchie,2018-07-30 13:02:00,1586,"You get a few salmon wander upstream in July and August every summer. That first good thunderstorm where it rains enough to raise the water level is all it takes. If it gets really hot again, they'll most likely croak. If not, they'll be spawning by Labour Day. For what it's worth, no it's not too early to hit the piers and yes, there have been a handful of fish caught at night off and on over the past couple of weeks. Go explore, you might be surprised. By the time you read about it on the internet, the best fishing is over and done. "
1032097,chessy,2018-08-02 02:10:00,610,the Atlantics and the browns are making there way up ... lots of nice fish .. 
1032098,BillM,2018-08-02 02:32:00,17367,"Seems a wee bit too early for browns, but when the rivers swell the fish do what they want, lol"
1032099,chessy,2018-08-02 02:36:00,610,nope the browns are about a week late .. they are always here this early .. the Atlantics showed up on the 27 .. we have some real nice ones go through ..we had first brown go through on the 11 of July 
1032179,BillM,2018-08-03 16:45:00,17367,Who wants to fish Angus though? lol
1032183,misfish,2018-08-03 17:02:00,29133,"Exactly. Take yer $40 and well, you know. LOL"
1032184,Fish frames,2018-08-03 17:25:00,36,"Going wayyy back, we used to cut through the corn field and walk across this sketchy wood plank over a creek holding onto all our gear and a crazy hot Coleman lantern in the middle of the night.  I was just a kid, not knowing what was going on.  Before internet - it took real life experience to figure stuff out with the help of other anglers to guide you - if they weren’t super a holes (lots back then). Just angry old grumpy men catching f’all bottom bouncing while the trib slightly north of it was gettig raped  by snaggers.  Oh the good old days lol.  I digress!"
1032298,John Bacon,2018-08-07 01:25:00,3277,Not just salmon and trout  ? 
1032303,chessy,2018-08-07 03:37:00,610,that little prick screws up ladder again .. hours of work ... 
1032304,John Bacon,2018-08-07 03:50:00,3277,Did it start building a dam above the ladder?
1032313,chessy,2018-08-07 13:40:00,610,it fills trash rack and last year it started shoving sticks and that in the logs throughout the ladder it opened the logs up just made a huge mess

1032325,Tom S,2018-08-07 19:08:00,362,Someone's probably adding 'foam earplugs' and 'big-ass treble hooks' to their shopping list after viewing it.
1032344,BillM,2018-08-08 01:14:00,17367,Don't forget the marshmellows!
1032345,ketchenany,2018-08-08 01:32:00,3229,"? Bill quit giving hints  , we need natural reproduction. NOT destruction. Marshmellows are bad for humans.  "
