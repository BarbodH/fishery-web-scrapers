The fishing net sinkers made of limestone represent a rare discovery of fishing gear from the Upper Paleolithic era or the Upper Old Stone Age, according to the Yonsei University Museum. The sinkers were unearthed during an excavation of four cultural phases from the Paleolithic era at the Maedun Cave in Jeongseon, Gangwon Province. The 14 sinkers comprised three from the first and top cultural phase, one from the second cultural phase and 10 from the third cultural phase, from which a jagged stone tool and a flake of stone were found together. Researchers at the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources have identified their ages as from 28,550 to 29,460 years by radiocarbon dating of charcoal contained in the lower part of the third cultural phase. ""If the figures are found to be correct, the net sinkers from the Maedun Cave are the earliest relics in the fishing history of mankind,"" a museum official said."

1032348,kickingfrog,2018-08-08 02:26:00,8333,Not as good as it was 30 thousand years ago. Ba dump bump
1032349,limeyangler,2018-08-08 02:28:00,5204,How do they know that is what they are? 
1032354,buick14,2018-08-08 11:00:00,741,Agreed.  Just looks like stones to me
1032356,Fisherman,2018-08-08 12:29:00,7201,And they've also found that carbon dating isn't all that accurate either.   Next thing they'l be telling us they found  outboard motors in Nippissing that are 500 years old.
1032357,Terry,2018-08-08 12:33:00,14456,I think they believe because there is a hole through each one of them implies man made
1032367,ketchenany,2018-08-08 20:41:00,3229,"OI ‘s friends have used those sinker for hundreds of years, they were’t fishing! just kidding OI. It has happened by accident at times."
1032398,John Bacon,2018-08-09 14:45:00,3277,Who found that carbon dating isn't all that accurate?  And when did the find that out? I don't see any holes in the ones on the picture.  But we only see them from one angle; so I guess they could have holes.

1032404,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-09 16:03:00,8243,You a funny guy Albert. Chamenta wasn't invented until 500BC so a guy hadda do whad he hadda do.
1032409,Sterling,2018-08-09 18:07:00,477,"Got another? This article describes a variation of 3500 years on a 20,000 year old sample, or 17%."
1032413,Fisherman,2018-08-09 19:38:00,7201,"One of the most widely used and well-known absolute dating techniques is carbon-14 (or radiocarbon) dating, which is used to date organic remains. This is a radiometric technique since it is based on radioactive decay.  Rock is not organic."
1032414,Sterling,2018-08-09 19:53:00,477,"Article states they dated organic remains within the rocks. The counter-argument to that is always ""but how do you date the rock itself?"" and ""what if the sample was contaminated?"". Answer being they will use a combination of other methods to validate the carbon dating. These scientists aren't dummies, it's unlikely they scraped dirt from the rock and called it a day. They've dedicated an entire lifetime to this type of work, so this sample was carefully and precariously assessed for valid, organic remains."
