1031677,AKRISONER,2018-07-25 12:30:00,5558,"those water bombers fly exactly like youd expect them to fly, like they are in a dog fight to save lives... i believe this is Henvey Inlet near the key river https://www.facebook.com/635205468/posts/10156244423100469/"
1031694,Tom S,2018-07-25 14:42:00,362,"Wow. That second last guy gave me a butt pucker with the way he turned in, but he backed right off at the end there. Brave fellows, I'd love to go for a ride with one of them."
1031695,AKRISONER,2018-07-25 14:51:00,5558,i dont think any of us regular folk could handle the G's those aces pull. Wed be passed out in the passenger seat.
1031709,Tom S,2018-07-25 16:25:00,362,For sure. Probably need a couple barf bags to. But I’d still love to try.
1031714,fishsevern,2018-07-25 17:49:00,112,We did go up on shoreline avenue. Didnt see any smoke but lots of helicopters. Best cottage vacation we ever had and returning next year. Temagami is a great lake.  Are u the guy with the big slide? I remember a long time ago it was on a members property. Stay safe
1031716,irishfield,2018-07-25 18:00:00,26272,"Were you at Ken's place?? Yah, that's us. Built the slide for our daughter in 2014 and we continue to use it in her honour!"
1031725,woodenboater,2018-07-25 21:18:00,2277,nah. just tighten up and clench up your muscles and you'll be fine. although I don't think they'd be pulling serious Gs but cld be wrong. Wayne ?
1031726,lew,2018-07-25 21:35:00,12766,"I highly doubt those G's are anywhere near what a fighter pilot endures, infact not even close."
1031742,irishfield,2018-07-26 03:53:00,26272,"Exactly Lew. Nobody is out there pulling high G's in a utility aircraft. I highly doubt, even fully banked and cranked to line up for the next scoop, that they are even reaching 2 g's in what look like tight turns due to camera angle. They are making fully coordinated turns in relatively slow flight as they conserve fuel to last as long as they can out on a fire. The CL415 is only rated for a 3.25 Maximum G pull and nobody is going to be testing that out fully loaded with fuel."
1031749,AKRISONER,2018-07-26 11:33:00,5558,"this video https://www.facebook.com/635205468/posts/10156244423100469/  makes me feel that those turns would not be comfortable for me at all lol. You are probably right though, they fly so damn smooth."
1031752,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-26 12:14:00,720,I’ve never thought about these planes before. That must be tough to fly. Surely they can’t carry much water? id like to see how it works to keep water from sloshing and how it dumps quickly
1031754,AKRISONER,2018-07-26 12:25:00,5558,"over 6,000 litres..."
1031756,irishfield,2018-07-26 12:26:00,26272,They fill to just over 1600 US Gallons Hack and have 4 dump doors. Their pair of turbine engines put out just over 5000 SHP !
1031757,John,2018-07-26 13:06:00,2956,I guess you would need that kind of output to climb fully loaded?
1031759,Tom S,2018-07-26 13:26:00,362,Lol. I looked that up last night for the kids and had to convert it to how many bathtubs of water for them to understand (about 20 from my figuring).
1031802,Woodsman,2018-07-26 21:09:00,1286,How big is your bath tub? 
1031810,Moosebunk,2018-07-27 01:45:00,3970,You and Leah stay safe... and get the heck outta there if need be man.  Can't be good for either of ya sucking that in for long either.
1031812,HTHM,2018-07-27 02:12:00,4082,"You are not far off the mark, the median volume for a bathtub is 75 gallons 1600/75=21.333 bathtubs."
1030842,Woodsman,2018-07-08 22:30:00,1286,TEMAGAMI FIRE CHIEF JIM SANDERSON HAS JUST SENT THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE... MNR fire has notified me that they are putting 	Temagami on Evacuation Alert. People should be prepared to leave if notified of an evacuation. If people want to leave on their own they need to go North as per MNR direction 	The emergency community group is being activated and meeting shortly 	Thanks 	Jim
1030843,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-08 22:42:00,2585,I was just up there.  My inlaws are a couple miles from the fire. The water bombers are scooping water on there lake from fly bys.  Scary stuff up there right now.
1030847,Woodsman,2018-07-08 22:48:00,1286,lunkerbasshunter it's far more than one fire in the area. MNR's resources and limited to handle so many active fires.
1030849,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-08 22:51:00,2585,Yeah they are in the south end of Temagmi/Marten river area.  There fire isn't under control yet but its not as bad as north they hear.  They are suppose to get an update this evening.
1030852,Woodsman,2018-07-08 22:59:00,1286,This fire that is affecting Temagami is approaching the town from the south west along Lake Temagami. 
1030854,Terry,2018-07-08 23:04:00,14456,I hope Wayne is safe on his island
1030858,Joeytier,2018-07-08 23:12:00,3990,"Looking at smoke out of my window off and on all day today.  Many, many fires in NE On and along the QC side.  Too much lightning, not enough rain. "
1030859,Woodsman,2018-07-08 23:13:00,1286,The fire may not get him but air quality will be very bad. 
1030860,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-08 23:13:00,2585,here is a decent update.  My inlays just texted and said they are good but water bombers all day long https://www.baytoday.ca/local-news/forest-fire-problem-increasing-in-the-region-978502  
1030861,Woodsman,2018-07-08 23:17:00,1286,lunkerbass where are your inlaws? 
1030863,HTHM,2018-07-09 01:26:00,4082,I hope we hear from Wayne soon: https://www.baytoday.ca/local-news/emergency-crews-on-scene-of-fatal-airplane-crash-in-west-nippising-978773
1030864,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-09 01:53:00,2585,Marten River.  5 minutes from trappers.
1030871,misfish,2018-07-09 11:15:00,29133,"Yes.  Wayne, lets us know you guys are alright."
1030872,Terry,2018-07-09 11:35:00,14456,"Unless he goes home or somewhere with internet he cant report  if he is safe on the island he is isolated , the way he likes it"
1030873,Terry,2018-07-09 12:01:00,14456,Got got some info  they are fine and still at the cottage the water bombers got it out before it burnt down the park across from them
1030901,fishsevern,2018-07-09 19:01:00,112,This is truly frightening for those who live up there.  I just keep thinking about those pictures from Fort McMurray. Is there any chance the fires are under control and I can take my planned family vacation there next week?  I've got my buddy's place booked right across the water from Findlayson Provincial park.  Was supposed to leave this Saturday.
1030907,kickingfrog,2018-07-09 21:41:00,8333,Latest from the North Bay paper: http://www.nugget.ca/2018/07/09/evacuation-order-warnings-remain-in-place-as-crews-fight-fires  
1030914,moose,2018-07-09 23:13:00,266,there is no power in the Temagami area
1030915,moose,2018-07-09 23:14:00,266,some cells are  you can keep tabs on Temagami facebook page 
1030917,misfish,2018-07-09 23:41:00,29133,Thank buddy That bat phone paid off.
1031668,irishfield,2018-07-25 02:12:00,26272,"That I was....  on the roof with a rag across my face running a hose for about 9 hours while Leah prepped our ""go bags"" if we decided to bug out and passed my supper up to me in a bag as I wouldn't come off the roof. Wind was 40 gusting 60 and from the time we spotted the new fire smoke bloom at Crab Lake it only took 2 hours to get 3+ miles down the shore even with 6 water bombers hammering it. In the days to follow I have had the waterslides pump running rotating rain heads to soak the trees and property down. At times on Sunday evening, July 8th, I was actually waving at water bomber captains from the roof and they were waving back!! That close... This fire had smoldered without being noticed for probably a week before the wind hit it just right and off it went so wildly that the smoke fumes were burning and rolling on top of the trees just like your airtight wood stove does. On the mornings that I have been able to get out and sneak in a flight I have called in 3 new fires within 18 miles of Town and there have been dozens spring up DAYS after lightning storms. We finally got about a 1/2 "" of rain on Sunday and then a good 3"" last night that almost sunk my 12'r and Leah's steel boat. Figured with that it was safe to make a run home but if the heat comes back that precip won't be enough to lift any fire ban or stop new fires from starting. Hope to be back up by Thursday night. Tourism sucks for sure, Lakeland is flying maybe 3 flights a week vs the usual 6 or more a day. All camps and Crown land West of Hwy 11 are off limits so they've had to cancel most bookings for their back lake camps and canoe shuttles to Lady E and Smoothwater PPark. Fishsevern !! Did you come up?? and where? I'm across from the park! Will add some pics when I get them downloaded."
1031670,irishfield,2018-07-25 03:24:00,26272,A few pictures and a video at the bottom to click.       summer2018 738.MOV
1031672,Terry,2018-07-25 08:27:00,14456,Scary stuff for sure
1031673,misfish,2018-07-25 09:29:00,29133,Hope the out come stays in your favor Wayne. Those are cool shots of the planes.
1031674,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-25 09:55:00,720,Those firefighters and pilot are a wildly brave bunch. I hope they can save everyone's properties safely. Those guys are unsung hero’s
