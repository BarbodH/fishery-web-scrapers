1031294,Snidley,2018-07-17 18:43:00,620,"Fish and Save is great especially when they have a sale but watch out for the shipping. The amount of shipping can often be mitigated by looking at you products and eliminating heavy or bulky items form your cart. Ditch the coil of lead, and order more flys or cranks as they weigh less. By the way sometimes that site sells a dozen flys for $2.00 to $3.00 when they have a flyboy sale."
