1032335,misfish,2018-08-07 21:58:00,29133,What brand are the purple peppers Bruce? First time I have seen. Are they sweet ?
1032342,ketchenany,2018-08-08 00:18:00,3229,"I was wondering the same thing. Serve those when the kids come a few times and they won’t be back lol. those light green hot jobs are amazing, I BBQ them and use them in pulled pork sandwiches. Just to give it a kick."
1032355,bigugli,2018-08-08 11:01:00,6138,"I have 2 types of purple bell. One is P star the other is P beauty. I also have chocolate and black. They are heirloom varieties. Purples are mild in flavour. Chocolates are sweeter than reds. Ketchenany,  the Hungarian hots are a nice pepper with more heat than a jalapeno but much sweeter. "
1032362,jimmer,2018-08-08 17:10:00,2730,That's quite the harvest already.  I'm envious and the darn red squirrels are going to effect my yield. :-(
1032363,AKRISONER,2018-08-08 17:19:00,5558,man...i want those jalepenos. In my experience ones grown in the garden are like 10 times hotter than the grocery store's...yummm
1032365,crappieperchhunter,2018-08-08 20:18:00,2582,Looks good Bruce. My garden is doing well too....cantaloupes next week I hope. Hopefully you are still finding some time to get out and fish.
1032368,dave524,2018-08-08 20:41:00,4508,"Looking good Bruce, a little surprised your Hungarian Hots pack more heat than the Jalapenos ,  I found my Jalapenos' were a notch higher on the scale. When we got the dogs I gave up on gardening , I just sponge off the neighbour now ?"
1032369,misfish,2018-08-08 20:54:00,29133,Dont forget to let me know when the shepperds are ready in woodyville.
1032370,ketchenany,2018-08-08 21:09:00,3229,"I’m in for those too. I’ll keep looking,  still early. My farms close by have been shut down 1/2 mil condos are better . Only Longos and Fortino May have them. Bruce do you guys have any? But the cost of a day trip would not make it possible I believe."
1032376,bigugli,2018-08-08 23:42:00,6138,Peppers for the store are picked prematurely for maximum shelf life .  They are not truly ripe until they are red. These are the size of cannon shells
1032377,bigugli,2018-08-08 23:44:00,6138,I hope to have a first pick of cantalope this week as well. Have a full row of them
1032378,bigugli,2018-08-08 23:46:00,6138,"On Scoville scale this variety of jalapeno is 5-6000, the Hungarians are 8-10000 scoville units"
