1031489,Acountdeleted,2018-07-21 13:28:00,2562,"We just came back from a 4 day camping trip on a back country lake with smallmouth. All were caught in 3 to 20 FOW (lake is up to 70 feet deep but when we found the hot spot we didn’t bother moving. White wacky worms worked best. White spinners did well and my fiancée got the biggest of the trip with a night crawler. I kid you not, this smallie was over 5lbs. Talking to other people  on the lake they were having no success with spoons, jerk baits, jointed rapalas."
1031496,OhioFisherman,2018-07-21 16:11:00,6623,"Sounds like a fun time, and I believe it, I think you have a lot of lakes up there capable of having a 5+ pound smallie or largemouth."
1031536,fish_fishburn,2018-07-22 14:39:00,1311,"If the lake is rocky find nice rock drop offs. Fish as light as possible a jig and make contact with bottom. I prefer to use a spinning rig light action 8-10 lb test. Drag on bottom, hop it or a slow swim back to the boat. They will tell you what they prefer. Watermelon or pumpkin seed my go to colours.. And scent them up."
1031608,riddickulous,2018-07-23 19:26:00,27,"I haven't tried it, but your structure sounds perfect for a neko rig - wacky rigged senko with screwed-in weight."
1031681,lureme,2018-07-25 13:36:00,21,"Do not forget the simple tube jigs as you can drag them along the bottom to imitate craws, bounce the bottom like gobies, or swim them like a bait fish. I would stick to darker colors like pumkin-seed, green, blk-brown. Use a 1/4 ounce sinker to allow a slower drop. For smallies fish the drop offs, rock piles and a little deeper water then you would for largies. "
1031690,Dutch01,2018-07-25 14:19:00,1431,"So just an update, I blew up my shoulder so I missed Lovesick Lake. I took the kayak to the cottage thinking it night get better in time but couldn't use it, so I fished off the dock. There's real clear shallow water at the dock so I had pretty low expectations. I managed to hook this guy on the Ned rig so I was pretty happy about that. Got lots of others but of course they were little. I'm resting up the shoulder in the hope it'll get better in time to use all these great tips on the August long weekend at Restoule PP. "

1031209,Dutch01,2018-07-16 00:27:00,1431,"Thanks for the time spent! I've got all these ideas setup in my tackle trays now. Except live bait (which I like). Pain in the rear in a kayak. You can do it, I just don't want to deal with it at least until fall when it's cooler."
1031210,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-16 04:41:00,8243,I choose to suffer for our friends here. I have a short attention span from watching too much Sesame Street.
1031213,singingdog,2018-07-16 11:21:00,1047,"Surprised that no one has mentioned swimbaits or lipless cranks. If I were fishing deeper, open water those 2 presentations would at the top of my list. 4-5"" swimbait on a jighead is great for fishing the entire column, as is a lipless crank. If I am searching for fish, a lipless crank is one of my first choices."
1031219,OhioFisherman,2018-07-16 14:23:00,6623,"LOL, you're right of course, but we could soon overload his yak with choices! Underspins!"
1031221,Garnet,2018-07-16 14:38:00,2056,"The most miserable bait ""Spy Bait"" they work. And Ned Rig. Just think your secret little spot gets fish 30-40 every week. Half with jerks and tops the other half tube and drop shot."
1031240,David Chong,2018-07-16 19:06:00,836,Not easy to fish a jerkbait properly out of a kayak unless you can stand up in it! Some of the hotter Smallmouth presentations nowadays are: 1/ Ned Rig (Z-Man Finesse T.R.D. on a Shroomz head) 2/ Neko Rig (Daiwa Neko Bait with an Ultra Tungsten Nail Weight on an Owner Wacky or Neko hook.) 3/ Swimbait (Rigged on a Football jig or a Swim Jig) 4/ Spybaits 5/ Ultra Tungsten T-Blade (Compact Tungsten Spinnerbait) Good luck!
1031242,Dutch01,2018-07-16 19:14:00,1431,I actually do have the nails and daiwa worms for the neko  rig I'll try that out too
1031245,AKRISONER,2018-07-16 21:06:00,5558,"listen to this man  Dave what do you think of Z man's new ned rig TRD craw...thing looks friggin deadly.  also..of course live bait works but in the essence of not killing fish that you intend to release, dont use it. You will do fantastic drop shotting Megabass hazedongs in ghost shad colour. Trust me."

1031280,AKRISONER,2018-07-17 13:03:00,5558,This thing is literally going to destroy the smallmouth
1031314,smitty55,2018-07-18 02:25:00,928,I'm really surprised no one has mentioned hair jigs for smallies. I guess they've been around for too long hehe.  A very versatile year round lure for SMB. I think it would be easy enough to use out of a yak as well Here's a good read for you Dutch. http://www.in-fisherman.com/bass/catching-smallmouths-with-hair-jigs/  Cheers
1031316,OhioFisherman,2018-07-18 02:54:00,6623,"Yes they work, and not just for smallies, largemouth, and walleye like them too! I used a 1/8th ounce with a pork grub trailer that I put rubber legs thru with pieces from a kush ball. Actually bought some years ago from Jensen Jigs in that article."
1031322,ehg,2018-07-18 11:10:00,2666,Completely agree. Once topwaters drop off went to rattlin rap (blk/slv) or Twister tail sassy shad paddletail  (blk/slv) jig to cover water at different depths

1031324,Dutch01,2018-07-18 11:54:00,1431,Thanks that was a good read. I have a few bucktails but will keep an eye out for the other hair types.

1031331,singingdog,2018-07-18 13:26:00,1047,I used to be a die-hard hair jig fisherman especially in the fall. I often fished all of October and November with nothing but a black bear hair jig. My experience the last few years has been that the Ned rig will generally out fish a hair jig
1031335,grimsbylander,2018-07-18 16:35:00,3016,Just checked the results online. Strange year. Looks like Rideau was a tough bite. You'll kill it on the big river this weekend...you always do. Winds ok out of the south as of now. Good luck.

1031360,grimsbylander,2018-07-19 12:31:00,3016,That's for sure.
1031393,KraTToR,2018-07-19 18:00:00,506,"Drop shot is my personal fav cuz you can use it in a variety of depths and conditions.  TR craw is a good idea but you can also use creature baits. Again, deeper water you'll want more action from the plastic - the reason  wacky works so well is the action it produces when rigged that way..  My order would be: "
1031170,Dutch01,2018-07-15 14:50:00,1431,"I'm fishing for smallies from my kayak on one of the deeper Kawartha Lakes next Saturday. I've got three tactics I want to use but I don't want to limit myself. I know there's a lot better bass  fisherman than me on here, so my question is If this was your list, what would you put in slot 4? 1. Topwater 2. Texas rigged craw 3. Drop shot 4."
1031173,kickingfrog,2018-07-15 15:02:00,8333,"Topwater, although a topwater would also be number 2 and 3 as well for me. lol  With your other 3 options I'd suggest a minnow/twitch bait or a crankbait."
1031174,OhioFisherman,2018-07-15 15:03:00,6623,Depending on the water depth and structure a tube might be #1.
1031175,bushart,2018-07-15 15:27:00,2628,Tubes then grubs----smoke and green are good Jerkbaits Wacky senkos always work Big spinnerbaits are another option
1031176,Dutch01,2018-07-15 15:34:00,1431,"I looove the topwater bite, it's so fun! Since tubes mimick a craw I was thinking the Texas rig craw would cover tubes but is weedless. Also worried about tubes killing my line with twist. Do you have any issues with twist? I have a couple rapala husky jerks, I'll throw them in my tackle tray! Got senkos too. The main reason I'm staying at 4 is I am only taking four rods on the kayak!"

1031178,grimsbylander,2018-07-15 15:42:00,3016,"Tube, no doubt. You can fish a tube from 3' of water to 50+'."
1031179,Dutch01,2018-07-15 15:57:00,1431,I've never had luck with tubes before  but I guess I need to give them another go. Any tips for managing line twist?
1031180,Acountdeleted,2018-07-15 16:16:00,2562,Oh man. Everyone put great answers here. Tubes spinners wacky rig senkos deep diving cranks.  Can’t go wrong with any of these.
1031181,BillM,2018-07-15 16:37:00,17367,Jerkbaits/spinnerbaits.  you need something in the middle of the water column that you can cover a lot of water with.
1031182,OhioFisherman,2018-07-15 16:40:00,6623,""" Since tubes mimick a craw I was thinking the Texas rig craw would cover tubes but is weedless. Also worried about tubes killing my line with twist. Do you have any issues with twist? "" Never did, when fishing open water I used a tube insert jig head, around weeds and wood I would texas rig them, and if you want to you can carolina rig them. On Lake Erie here weed beds were very limited, mostly in shallower back bays which usually only saw any kind of a smallie bite during the spawn. Open water I was usually fishing 15 - 25 feet for them, no weeds, just rocks. Just my opinion but a white tube with silver glitter may also imitate a bait fish? and who knows what else? I have also caught steelhead, carp, and walleye on them."
1031184,bushart,2018-07-15 17:13:00,2628,Insert an in-line swivel 18 inches up from your bait

1031186,Garnet,2018-07-15 17:16:00,2056,Tube muscle up on the line and weight. 3/8 and 20 flouro 20 braid. Get in there and snap that tube. Everybody is twiddly dumping 6 lb get in there face
1031187,Dutch01,2018-07-15 17:28:00,1431,"Funny you should say that, 3 of my 4 rods have six pound test on them! The fourth is my baitcaster which has braid with a flouro leader. I'll try the tube on that one."

1031191,Dutch01,2018-07-15 18:37:00,1431,I've actually been doing pretty well on suspended bass using topwater lures this summer so far. Plus it's so much fun! But of course if it's not producing I'll switch it up.
1031192,misfish,2018-07-15 19:01:00,29133,Interesting. This whole year is screwed up. Lakers are late and smashing baits now. ?
1031196,AKRISONER,2018-07-15 20:11:00,5558,"fished north end of pigeon for smallies yesterday. That soupy water is so settled on top of the cool water below we couldnt get anything to bite unless we broke through the thermocline. I think we hit 1 or 2 on the jerkbait, absolutely not even a single bite on the topwater and everything else on drop shotted megabass hazedongs. They were being so finnicky we could hardly get them to bite cross tail shads. if i had 4 rods? id be running topwater jerkbait dropshot craw on a jig"
1031197,AKRISONER,2018-07-15 20:13:00,5558,I find around labour day the topwater bite literally vanishes Its like someone turns off a lightswitch and you wont hit a thing topwater till opener next year. Maybe im weird by my best topwater time is always opener until the lakes get too hot. August i do really well on jerkbaits and then september when the topwater bite shuts off i know its time to go dropshot shoals.
1031198,BillM,2018-07-15 20:19:00,17367,Mid to late Oct is always my best smallie bite.   August is good as well when they're schooling shiners and other spawning bait fish.
1031203,misfish,2018-07-15 21:03:00,29133,"I cam only post what I have experienced on Simcoe. Guess I,ll find out again this fall."
1031206,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-15 22:18:00,8243,"Something I know a bit about. 1) Topwater. Early in AM and a few hours before dusk, the water doesn't need to be dead calm but I like it like glass. I use Rappala. 2)Tubes. When they are lockjawed I find tubes in natural colours best. Pumpkin seed, green metal flake and a tinge of blue. Softshell Crabs in Ont. have a blue tinge to them. 3)Jerkbaits. Many swear by them and they work. 4)Dropshot with live bait. This time of year a 2 or 3 in that is natural to the lake.  By the fall I will use the biggest shiner I can find. 5) Spinners/Spinnerbaits. Black Fury is #1, #2 any mid size SB with Colorado blades. 6) Floating Rappala jerked across the surface. Art or Blue it took ma 20 minutes or more to type this"
