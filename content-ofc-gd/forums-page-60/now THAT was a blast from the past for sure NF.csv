1032216,lew,2018-08-04 17:03:00,12766,I've always like old airplanes and this morning my wife & I had to go into Lakefield...north of Peterboro...and while I'm sitting in a parking lot I hear the roar of an airplane not too far over head and look up and darned if I don't see an old  B-29 bomber flying by. Not exactly something you expect to see LOL I did a bit of searching on GOOGLE and found it's visiting the area this weekend. Pretty Kool thing to see flying by. https://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/whatson-story/8795886-b-29-superfortress-bomber-fifi-celebrates-73rd-birthday-at-peterborough-airport/
1032217,OhioFisherman,2018-08-04 17:08:00,6623,It's pretty amazing that some of those old birds are still flying.
1032218,lew,2018-08-04 17:15:00,12766,"Yeah it sure is Paul, and last year there was a B-17 up here for a few days but unfortunately I didn't get to see it. After I got out of the Navy at the end of ""66 and was waiting to start on the Fire Dept I got a job at Toronto Airport to fill in the time and we had an old B-25 stored at our hanger and I used to go sit in it sometimes and try to imagine what it must have been like for the crews of those planes during the war when everybody was trying to shoot them outta the sky. Took a certain breed of people to do that stuff. The old B-25 was bought by the Confederate Airforce in Texas and they were gonna restore it but I never heard anymore about it after they got it. "
1032219,OhioFisherman,2018-08-04 17:55:00,6623,"Depending on where they are coming from I am on the flight path for Cleveland  Hopkins, Burke Lakefront, and Akron - Canton airports. With the air show at Burke Lakefront we get some of those planes wandering the skies here. Planes are cool, but I have never had any interest or desire to get in the air."
1032220,lew,2018-08-04 18:06:00,12766,Probably close to 50 years since I've been on a plane too Paul
1032222,grimsbylander,2018-08-04 19:28:00,3016,"Lew, if that is something that really interests you have you gone to the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton? Check out their website it's quite amazing. You can book flights on a dozen different planes from a bi-plane to the Lancaster bomber! The B-29 will be there at the end of August and you can tour inside the plane or book a flight. Not cheap for the flight but not many options to fly in one of those old classics. The Lancaster flies over my house periodically and the sound of the engines is amazing. I can imagine it would have been terrifying to hear that thing coming in it's day.  http://www.warplane.com/  "
1032224,lew,2018-08-04 20:20:00,12766,"No, I've never been to the Warplane Museum but have thought it would be very interesting and also the one in Ottawa. I've seen the old Lancaster many times when I lived in Toronto and was always more than impressed i with it. My Mom's brother was a bomber pilot during the war and sadly he was killed along with his entire crew when their plane went down during the war."
1032229,misfish,2018-08-04 23:16:00,29133,Very cool Lew.  Read this and just put on the  Memphis Belle movie.
1032230,Garnet,2018-08-04 23:16:00,2056,Buffalo Mikey was yapping about the sound of Lancaster and never shout up so we could hear.
1032232,Tom S,2018-08-05 01:39:00,362,"Worth the stop if you're in the area. I volunteered there a little bit during college, my FIL still does. Lanc was overhead today, love the sound of those Merlin engines."
1032234,Gerritt,2018-08-05 02:06:00,6129,"Lew, cool thread! Not sure if you are aware but we have a National Warplane Museum and its not too far away. Its located in Trenton you could spend the whole day looking at and learning about vintage war birds. Some of the planes are interactive and you can sit in them etc.. a ton of memorabilia as well. I've visited it several times and have always found it enjoyable.  G"
1032244,lew,2018-08-05 15:28:00,12766,"I quite often  get some really interesting low flying planes around my place, specially a Hercules from Trenton and a couple years back this guy was circling overhead waiting to join a military show down in Peterboro. He passed directly over my house several times and I got some nice pictures.   I'd hoped that old B29 would show up and sure enough he passed overhead 20 minutes ago but I was working outside and couldn't get my camera in time. It's very loud and can be heard a ways away so I'm gonna be waiting for him next time LOL"
1032248,outllaw,2018-08-05 15:55:00,1232,"awesome LEW.i get the shivers when I see thoe old war horses..living near an airport every once in a whil they fly over. we see lots of new age f-16,s and 18,s. .but the old prop babys are history."
1032249,OhioFisherman,2018-08-05 16:24:00,6623,If you're into that kind of thing there is this.  https://www.nationalmuseum.that other site.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/
1032251,captpierre,2018-08-05 16:39:00,2521,See the news of the German vintage warplane crash in Switzerland. Much loss of life.
1032263,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-06 01:59:00,8243,"Oh Lew you must take the ride. We are fortunate that the Hamilton airport is about 20 nautical miles from us. A few week  ago I would bet that Bomber was here flying very low almost every day, maybe pre flights before heading your way. We can hear the Lancaster from 15 miles away at the least. Can you imagine being in a European city and hearing 20 or more of them heading towards you with all the escort fighters in the dead of night? Horrific. This post took me 20 minutes to type. Type away and see nothing on the screen, theen 20 letters show up for the same word. The cursbacks up 20 words so I have to kool at each and every word enreerede. I didn't edit the last seence or thas one. Frustrating."
1032265,OhioFisherman,2018-08-06 04:59:00,6623,"20 would be like a mini raid, they kind of liked to do those thousand plane raids? Fighter escorts were generally a daytime deal, the Brits bombed at night because early on their fighters didn't have the range to provide an escort. The Americans learned  that daylight bombing without one was getting far to many pilots can killed and planes destroyed."
1032266,lew,2018-08-06 10:13:00,12766,I remember watching a show about the most influential planes of WW2 and top of the list was the P51 Mustang as that was the 1st fighter that had the range to escort & protect the bombers deep into Germany.
1032309,outllaw,2018-08-07 11:47:00,1232,yes lew hey implemented drop tanks to give fighter escorts more range.
1032336,wdodgetruck,2018-08-07 22:04:00,27,We have a close family friend who flew in a bomber in ww2.  I always enjoy  our visits with him .The stories are amazing. Those guys  are just awesome. Here is a link to his  squadron https://wartimememoriesproject.com/ww2/view.php?uid=22420
