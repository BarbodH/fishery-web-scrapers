1031647,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-24 16:38:00,8243,"I also don't consider fuel consumption as the highest criteria on a list for a vehicle. Reliability,  drivability, comfort, purpose and safety first. I got blasted here for saying just that on an old thread about mileage. By the way drove from Selkirk to north of Newmarket yesterday, 5.6 L/100K there in 4 banger Kia, bumper to bumper through TO on the way back 9.2L/100K. If I had to drive in that mess everyday I would lose it worse than I did yesterday. I would have to wear Depends. 2 exits before I could get off and find a discrete bush."

1031506,Raf,2018-07-21 18:08:00,3495,"if you don't need the size of a 1/2 ton, then you may be a good candidate for a colorado/canyon short box then.  our long box is still a little 'long' for many parking spots [i usually park far away with the other trucks] but fits the width fine.  these new 'mid-size' trucks are not much smaller than the 1/2 tons of 15 years ago.   the 1/2 tons have really ballooned since then.  i'd look at the honda ridgeline too.. it's a lot more 'car-like' but a fwd platform wasn't right for me -- maybe it will be for you. as i get older and lose the desire to work on my vehicles to save costs, factory warranty is nice.  your 2011 should fetch pretty good value on the used market as all trucks do."

1031529,G.mech,2018-07-22 13:31:00,830,"Mine never had a wrench on it other than oil changes, a set of brakes, and regular maintenance.  Fuel system & injectors had not been touched since new.  Others have reported the same circumstances although some fires did occur after injector work.  I find it offensive that FCA or anybody else would try to blame the end users for something as serious as this.....I guess until somebody dies, it won't ever be sorted out and they will just keep sweeping it under the rug."
1031530,dintymoore,2018-07-22 13:42:00,62,"Brutal. Yet another reason to hate a Dodge. No truck more reliable than a Toyota. More expensive, but you'll find yourself at the garage less. You get what you pay for."

Without the C in your equation nothing will smelt , burn, catch ablaze etc. Without Carbon nothing will catch fire, absolutely nothing.  The Cave Men caught onto that. You are close, Fe+O2= FeO+Fe2O3. I have lit plenty of Iron and Steee"
1031561,lew,2018-07-22 21:53:00,12766,I always find it interesting around here how very interesting discussions can so easily get derailed into a totally unrelated discussion.
1031562,John Bacon,2018-07-22 22:04:00,3277,But the C comes from hydro carbons; not pure carbon.  The properties of compound are not like the properties of the individual atoms.  	The properties of NaCl (aka table salt) are not the properties of either chlorine gas nor sodium.  Water has more oxygen than the air we breath; but I wouldn't recommend trying to breath it.  	Carbon combined with hydrogen is used for fuel.  Carbon combined with oxygen is used to extinguish fires.  	Carbon and hydro carbons are very different.  A piece of carbon is not easy to burn.

And it's got a small tank."
1031566,grimsbylander,2018-07-23 02:48:00,3016,"Frankly, I'm surprised that people place fuel mileage so high on the list of what defines a good truck. I pay the same price as everyone else and can honestly say it's way down my list of what's really important. One repair bill can to easily negate any possible savings realized. I had two separate mechanics suggest I avoid Dodge Rams and I did. Who knows? I feel bad for Gmech though...nasty pics."
1031568,chris.brock,2018-07-23 04:23:00,4053,"When my wife was considering a new Jetta I calculated it would take 12 years of fuel savings to recoup the initial extra cost for the diesel option. Fuel, initial cost, resale, reliabilty/ repairs, etc.  It's a pretty complicated equation. I think FCA is generally crap and I drive one too. Also, those on board mileage computers might be telling you what you want to hear. It's better to do your own calculations. The hot summer weather = better mileage too."
1031576,Fisherman,2018-07-23 12:45:00,7201,"Mine is hand calculated, pretty close to the on board computer.  No doubt summer weather and #2 Diesel gets better mileage."

1031480,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-21 12:24:00,8243,"G. Mech, has there been a root cause determined as to how a new truck goes up in flames? Somehow carbon came in contact with an ignition source, fuel leak, how? My Silverado came close to going up in a ball of flames in the heart of Gore Park in downtown Hamilton at 4 pm yesterday. I coming down the James St./Becket hill and notice no need for brakes. Come to a stop at St. Joes hospital and smell something burning and hear the brakes crunching. Front left caliper is stuck on and it's smoking, in bumper to bumper gridlock. Not even a place to pull over. I slam the brakes on and off and it frees up. Finally get to where I'm going downtown and buddy says I smell gas. Fuel line has a leak, that was a close one. Always carry a roll of Duct Tape, truck and boat. Got me to a garage 2 blocks away. As far as gas mileage, it sucks. Pulling the boat it sucks even worse. 40 bucks of gas to get to Hamilton and back to the lake, around 110 KMS. Maybe because the brakes are stuck on, that can't be good for fuel economy can it?  I am impressed with some of the mileage you Ram guys are getting. 9.6L/100KMS ??? Better check the calculator, if that's correct it's unbelievable for any V8 let alone a truck. That's what my wife's 6 cyl. 3.5 lt 280HP Nissan Altima was getting.  Now she's getting 6L to 7L/100kms on her new Kia Optima, but it's missing 4 cylinders."

1031497,G.mech,2018-07-21 16:12:00,830,"No way they'll ever figure that out, the engine compartment was basically empty after the fire since all the aluminum and magnesium parts were consumed including the hood, turbo housing, rad, tranny cooler etc.  It was definitely a fuel fire though, probably an injector broke or something because the entire engine compartment was covered in burning fluid when I got the hood open and the was no sign of oil anywhere and it held 15L.   Thank god for replacement value insurance, they bought me a brand new, current model year truck with all the toys!  It is NOT another eco-diesel however after this episode.

1031498,Raf,2018-07-21 16:43:00,3495,"For our use case (typical homeowners, 2 adults, a 6 year old and a boat) the truck is perfect.  Only slight complaint I have is I should have gotten the 'luxury package' or whatever it is called that has the leather seats -- the cloth seats can be a little uncomfortable on really long trips -- the upgraded seats are said to be better in that regard.  The truck gets about 26-27k kms a year and the diesel made sense given what I posted about fuel economy above.  I bought the long bed and it handles loads fine although you cannot lay a 4x8 sheet of drywall flat due to the wheel wells.   I've hauled dirt, firewood and appliances in it with no issues.  1500lb payload and 7600lb towing in the 4x4 diesel which is more than the Ram EcoDiesel 1/2 ton. What is your reason for getting out of the Silverado?   Ultimately, I went Colorado because of the diesel.  I don't do a lot of short trips (which are said to be 'bad' for modern diesels) my commute is 65kms each way. If comparing the v6 in the Colorado/Canyon vs the 5.3 in the Silverado, the fuel consumption difference will be fairly small and the Silverado is a bigger, more comfortable truck.  If it was gas vs gas I think I would have went 1/2 ton. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions."
1031503,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-21 17:43:00,8243,"Thanks for the great response Raf. Believe it or not the truck is too big. I am close to 64 and parking it in a lot is a pain, if you look at my tailgate you can tell . It is the 4 door crew cab 4x4 2011 I bought new in 011'. The only spot it fits in is the Disabled spot and I won't use it if I can help it. I average 15  MPG. Up to a month ago all I did was a battery, tires and pads. At 139,000 kms the fuel pump went, brakes locked up on me and a fuel leak just yesterday. Time to let her go, I love the truck but it's time. Everything is 1000 bucks these days and I can 1000 buck myself to the poor house."
