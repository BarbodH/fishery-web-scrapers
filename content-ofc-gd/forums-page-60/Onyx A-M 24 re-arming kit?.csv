Looking  for a full re-arming kit as it looks like not only the cartridge needs replacing. The instructions mention a new ""bobbin"" and green indicator clip is needed not just a 24g CO2 cartridge. Will run over to CrappyTire to looksee but wondering if anyone has re-used the bobbin etc.? Of course won't cheap out if the old bobbin is UN-usuable but I have some 24g cartridges laying around already. Sorta know the answer already but just thought I'd throw it out there."
1031832,Rattletrap2,2018-07-27 20:38:00,1652,"I have a couple of the same ones from BPS. I have not had to get the re-arming kits, but I believe they had them in stock. You will need the Bobbin for sure."
1031835,Raycaster,2018-07-27 21:23:00,528,Looks like I will have to head out to BPS as CrappyTire seems to have no stock.
1031892,jjcanoe,2018-07-29 02:35:00,744,"They are nice comfy jackets, I have 2, those rearm kits are ONLY available at bass pro shops nice if you live nearby, but it's a 4 hour round trip for me. Both of mine went off in the rain in the storage compartment in my boat. Should not have happened! Reamed mine at 40 or 50$ for each kit but made them both manual."
1031896,Raycaster,2018-07-29 03:12:00,528,Actually CrappyTire in Brantford had 6 in STOCK. ($32)  But.... Had it all installed and then noticed the bobbin was dated 2015!!!  Instructions clearly state it should be less than 3 years old but I went ahead anyways and will buy (check date first) at BPS next time I'm in that area.    
1031897,jjcanoe,2018-07-29 03:36:00,744,"Mine have a different rearming kit  (#1352) maybe a different model jacket, mine are about 3 years old"
1031898,jjcanoe,2018-07-29 03:41:00,744,"The yellow bobbin is only needed if you are making it automatic. If just manual, there is a cap that is on the other side of the jacket in a little velcro pouch, that you put in place of the bobbin."
