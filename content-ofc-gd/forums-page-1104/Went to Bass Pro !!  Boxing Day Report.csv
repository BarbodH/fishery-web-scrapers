145803,Entropy,2007-12-27 20:12:00,747,"I was there at 6:50am, to get in line.  There were already 4 guys waiting.  20 seconds after I got in line there were another 15 guys getting into line.  By 8:00am (opening) there had to be at least 300 people lined up; around the corner and out of sight.  Many of the guys near the front of the line that I talked to were there to buy the 50 cal muzzle loader that was on sale.  At 8:00 when the doors opened the guys in front of me “moved quickly” through the turnstile – so did I.  Then once in the aisle they began to jog to the gun counter – so did I.  Then from the cornor of my eye I saw more people running to the counter, I yelled at the guys in front of me to “RUN” – They did! And so did I !!  I could not believe I was running – flat out – through a store on Boxing Day to buy an item on sale, but I did!  I was number 5 in line and got one of the 8 or so 50 cal.  But, it was not until 9:20 that I was able to walk away with the box in arm, paid and registered.  They only had about a total of 24 50cal and 45cal on sale.  The other 100 or so guys lined up at the gun counter were out of luck.  That was an experience.  Entropy"

145872,Smokey,2007-12-27 23:17:00,1278,Typical of Basspro to have a huge sale and only a few of the items to actually sell to people. Happens every flyer they put out.
145885,bassboy,2007-12-28 00:05:00,161,  I think they have the same people doing the ordering that CTC does......     Bill
