I only had one hit but my buddy who was using the fish finder in his hole caught 13 in the three hours we were out. Largest was maybe 10""."

145935,Musky or Specks,2007-12-28 02:04:00,2710,Take the south bay exit off of the 400. Park on the side of the road when you come to the bay. You'll see the huts.
