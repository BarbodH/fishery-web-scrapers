Drilled thru 6-8"" of hard black ice and set up the fishfinder...14'. Big dead minnow and a jigging I will go. Not even 4 jigs up and down and bang first Pike of the day about 20"".  Reset and within minutes another, then another then the best fight of the day was this largie brute. Thumped the minnow and dogged for the bottom leaving my drag a singing, once up to the hole had some trouble getting him thru. A sloid 3 lber, awesome fight on 4lbs test. Ended the day with another small pike and a perch. All fishies were released in good health. Good start to this season."
145586,icewalker28,2007-12-26 22:45:00,39,WTG joonmoon. Good to see you getting out on Boxing day. Malls are a little too crowded. Nice largie and pike.
145602,jediangler,2007-12-26 23:45:00,1923,Good going Bro. Nice varietyof fish. I stayed home and watched the Juniors and then the Spengler Cup and now I'm ready to watch the Leafs get smoked. Was Lake X in skatable condition?
145609,joonmoon,2007-12-27 00:17:00,528,"Ya I was home in time to watch the Juniors too, nice officiating eh! Lake ""X"" was pretty bumpy, some of it was skatable near the weedbed that sticks out of the water. I only fished for just under 2 hrs, so ya caught everything cept a Crappie and a Bluey, only drilled a few holes too."
