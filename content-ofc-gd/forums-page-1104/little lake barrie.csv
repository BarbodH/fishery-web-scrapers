145398,Rizzo,2007-12-26 02:55:00,4754,its been frozen for about a month now so I would think it would be fine.  Marina just froze over about a week ago so you better watch out over there!
145455,pikeie,2007-12-26 15:29:00,380,"the barrie marina had about 4 inches of ice yesterday, little lake has 6-8 inches of ice in most spots as of now, but with any early ice check the thickness as you go. good luck"
