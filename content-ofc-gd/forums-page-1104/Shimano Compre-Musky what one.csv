145655,irishfield,2007-12-27 03:10:00,26272,You'll have better luck on a Compre Muskie at JB's over on Ronson Drive. I've never found a Compre in BPS...  JB's 416-614-7222
145667,scuro,2007-12-27 05:25:00,386,"Using a gift certificate and cash, I bought a rarely used trade in combo for $220 no tax from my local fishing store. The combo was a Quantum PT 40 Spinning Reel, CompreÂ® Spinning Rod-7ft medium heavy action, with a full reel of premium braided line. I pike fish, fish in the south for Cuda, and have given muskie fishing a go. I imagine a 8 ft heavy action rod will give you more control with large muskie, these are things I'll be learning about in the future hopefully  What do you think of that combo at that price?"
