In some areas the ice is being eroded with the current under the ice leaving it in about 2-3 inches thick and then just a few feet away you might have 6-8 inches. Some of the local anglers who know the area are doing well getting some walleye through the ice. I would recommend that anyone coming up or thinking of coming up should check their tackle shops for the ice conditions for the area that they are heading to. I'm sure if you wait a couple of weeks mother nature is thinking of becoming a tad bit nasty and bring us some colder weather and we will have better ice conditions. I will be posting regular reports of the Bay of Quinte on my website and on a daily basis. This would save me from boring all of you with reports and for those that are not interested in the Bay of Quinte area.  Here is the link to my site  Bay of Quinte Reports  Best regards, Sam"
