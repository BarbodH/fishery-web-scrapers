Was in the store five minutes early, Got to top of store(3 level) I hear the guy at the registar yell to the dozen people that were about to swarm him say ""all the snow blowers have been sold"" So I went back home to bed for a couple more hours. Oh well next year."
145645,Rizzo,2007-12-27 02:27:00,4754,Are the deals really worth it? I think you'd have to be spending BIG bucks to make it worth the aggravation.  I went once about 10 years ago and found prices really weren't that good and the crowds ridiculous.  I've never been back and have no plans to.
