145131,Garyv,2007-12-24 17:50:00,547,As some of you know ever since my bowel surgery in April I have been having setback after setback and to be honest they have taken a psychological toll on me.  I have been to 6 different specialists and been poked and prodded to the point that I didn't much care what they did as long as they found something that was making me feel so tired and weak.  Over the past two months I have had numerous tests and biopsies to determine if I had some form of Cancer.  On Tuesday last I had my final needle biopsy on my lung where there was a questionable mass.  Got the results this morning and I am for now 100% Cancer free which to me was the best Christmas present I could have received.  I'm still into some major heart stuff that needs to be addressed but we can start with that stuff after January 1ST and hopefully get back to be able to at least do 50% of what I used to.
145133,irishfield,2007-12-24 17:53:00,26272,One hurdle jumped Gary ! Good luck with the next one.  Have a Great Christmas with your family and keep the faith. Your New Years present will hopefully be just as good as this one.
