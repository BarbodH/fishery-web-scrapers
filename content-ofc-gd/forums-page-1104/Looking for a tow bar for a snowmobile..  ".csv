145755,irishfield,2007-12-27 17:20:00,26272,Saw guys digging thru some tow bars in BPS a week back. Didn't pay them much attention though..
145757,northwood,2007-12-27 17:25:00,63,"Not a bad idea to start with ... i will give it a shot and call them,..  thanks irish,"""
145767,Joey,2007-12-27 17:58:00,9122,"Yes, they are at Bass Pro, but they had a very limited selection left.  Joey"
145771,fishnsled,2007-12-27 18:16:00,3520,They had a good selection at Gagnons the other day when I was in there.  Now are you looking for a tow bar or the hitch for your sled?  If you need it for your sled try Royal Distributing
145813,misfish,2007-12-27 20:39:00,29133,"If you can send me a shot of your connection at the rear of the sled,I could make one up for ya. Probly stronger then what ever you can buy. We can work out a price."
145818,irishfield,2007-12-27 21:05:00,26272,Will they miss the steel Brian! LOL
145823,misfish,2007-12-27 21:36:00,29133,"I was thinking of using your shop, and your Aluminum."
145852,irishfield,2007-12-27 22:33:00,26272,DANG !
145855,misfish,2007-12-27 22:35:00,29133," Of course,I would split the profits, as you would be doing the welding.  Serious though,if your interested,give me a PM."
145882,ecmilley,2007-12-27 23:48:00,2163,"royal distributing as mentioned, could also try your local yamaha dealer won't be as bad as you think for a tow bar made for your sled"
145971,northwood,2007-12-28 03:29:00,63,"I went to aselstiens this afternoon,..  they don't have the one made for the machine until febuary or march...  so i got one that fits over the back frame rail....  and maybe we can weld something.."
