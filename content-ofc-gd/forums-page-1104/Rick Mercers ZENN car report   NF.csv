Too bad they are not available in a market like Toronto,   they would sell so many of them that you'd be rich if you had the dealership....anyone want to partner up?  But then of course the government would find all kinds of ways to add taxes onto them that they would cost double the price at 24 grand! At 12 g's most could afford one of them as a second car.  If we could get an insurance, tax break and free license plates that would be fantastic! What an incentive that would be!  Zenn company website"
