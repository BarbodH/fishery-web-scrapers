145678,Rich Clemens,2007-12-27 11:18:00,3131,My best for Jack today  .... please do keep us posted.  You must have thought long and hard about responding to that post ... you handled it better than I would have.  Good to see you keeping the highest standards for this site.  Give Jack an ear scratch for me too.
145679,FishFinder,2007-12-27 11:33:00,481,  Im sorry but I have to ask how your dog alerted you to your cancer???
145688,huey graphite,2007-12-27 13:23:00,362,"Hey Rick, Good luck with the surgery. It's difficult watching a best friend suffer in pain like that. I have a 9 year old female yellow lab who very recently suffered the same injury, a cruciate tear in her left hind leg. Our vet suggested we try an anti-inflammatory and although it's relieved her pain somewhat, I know the surgery is inevitable. To complicate things, her right hind leg has given her trouble since she was 6 when she had a partial tear of her Achilles tendon.  I've got to say that your surgeons quote seems awfully high. Our vet quoted us at $800 for the surgery and an additional $800 for after care. I'm going to be contacting another vet in the Simcoe region that can do it for around $700 total from what I've been told.  Seeing how today is the date of surgery and it's too late to get another quote, you may want to discuss these rates with the surgeon.  Good Luck to Jack and please keep us all updated with the progress of his recovery."
145690,bigfish1965,2007-12-27 13:38:00,3382,"Well Jack is off to Scarborough. He has a complete tear of the ACL and the MCL and the internal ligaments and cartilage as well. Essentially the entire knee structure is shot. So he will need to have the ligaments repaired and a stabilizing plate put in...at least this is the initial diagnosis and hence the high cost. It would be nice to hear it wasn't quite all that bad, but the two vets who saw him weren't optimistic. The good thing is that given  his overall age and health they expect a near complete recovery as long as I do what I am supposed to for his post operative care. He will be tended to quite well. To answer your question, Skelz.. I had testicular cancer in the late 90's. My dog 'Cory' became rather emphatic with the all popular dog greeting of nose-to-crotch. In fact I couldn't get him to stop it with me. It was constant. Finally, one day, he gave me an extra good 'headbut' and scored a full strike. In the ensuing pain, I noticed a testicular lump which later that day was diagnosed as Stage 2 cancer. I had at first thought my dog 'broke' my teste. The doctor told me many golden retrievers have been found to be able to smell cancer cells and it was likely the dog was alerting me to this. After I had the package removed, he never did it again. Had he not hit me like that I likely wouldn't have noticed until it was too late."
145691,mistyriver1,2007-12-27 13:42:00,600," Rick, I knew you had the cancer but I never knew that's how you discovered it. WOW."
145693,lew,2007-12-27 13:49:00,12767,"Hey Rick, best of luck with Jack today , please give us an update when it becomes available."
