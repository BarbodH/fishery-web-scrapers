145371,glen,2007-12-25 23:20:00,2641,I ain't sure about that one.  But it looks like the type that you twist your line about four times to form a loop and then slide it under the little ball on the far left of the pic.
145372,fishindevil,2007-12-25 23:29:00,6254,"Hey doug those releases are great ,thery are the best stackers too !!! its hard to tell you over the puter,but there should be a diagram on the back of the package,i have 3 of them,at the bottom of the release you have to loop it around to where the little knob is,then loop it up top straight aboue and back down through,you can slide them up and down using that little stainless,metal tab,you can also adjust the tension too,with the dial at the bortom,they are the best!!!!"
145374,Mark Kulik,2007-12-25 23:47:00,348,"Fishindevil is right they are a very reliable release, the knob adjusts pressure, you basically place your line in the pad, close the releasethen thr lure end slides into the trigger looking thing on the bottom, after ward the line from the rod goes thru the same lever, -hard to describe it but the hit causes the pad to release. and you guy's thougtht I only know bass! LOL"
145375,fishindevil,2007-12-25 23:48:00,6254,"hey doug the flat part at the front goes on the line,then bring it under to the part where the knob is bring it up through there loop on the top and bring it back down through the part with the knob....its hard to say over the puter man but it really is easy,it takes about 10seconds....do you live nearby me im in oshawa???..LOL..LOL..LOL"
145376,Mark Kulik,2007-12-25 23:59:00,348,"It's tough to describe like fishindevil said-I tried looking up the threading diagram , but for some reason I can't get on the page, after the pad place both lines one at a time into the slot between the lever and ths small plastic ball."
145377,irishfield,2007-12-26 00:25:00,26272,You writing this all down douG ?
145489,douG,2007-12-26 17:24:00,2693,"Mark, I couldn't get to the page from Roemer either, which is why I posted here, I'm still not clear on the whole line threading thingy."
145498,Mark Kulik,2007-12-26 18:17:00,348,"Sorry Doug, its so hard to describe-if you still can't figuire it out come see me at thye Gamma line and St.Croix booth at the fishing shows, and I'll show you there, if you figuire it out great, come by and say hi anyhow.  cheers.  MARK"
