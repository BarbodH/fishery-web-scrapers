145544,Rich,2007-12-26 21:10:00,3927,"Sleded and I hit a couple of local ponds today in search of pike, mainly, but also spent some time chasing panfish. For the first time in history the pike fishing was actually better than the panfishing. We never did get a panfish. My highlight of the day was a 4lb OOS largemouth which I gave a long distance release at the hole (better that way). 16 feet was the magic number as that's where our fish hit. Sleded took the trophy of the day when he landed a beauty 32 inch pike on a chartreuse maribou jig of all things.  Was a great day to be out on the ice and despite people's whining there was 4-6 inches of ice everywhere we went.  The fog:    One of my Xmas presents, a new ice rod/tackle holder:    Sleded's beast:    A healthy release:    Great day on the ice, looking forward to many more!"
