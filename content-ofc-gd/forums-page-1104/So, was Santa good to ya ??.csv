Nothing too spectacular, but some solid stuff... in random order: Rapala sportsman spinning rod, Rapala spinning reel, new Plano tackle box, an assortment of lures, fishing cap light, rod holster, some Berkley line, fly fishing calendars, and a freshwater fishing book.. I really wanted a baitcasting combo, but it didn't come to pass.. hopefully I can spring for one and get it set up in time for ice out.."

My friend Amanda gave me the ceramic travel mug, the fishing calendar and the T-shirt, her mom gave me the mega mug   No lump of coal so I guess I wasn't too bad this past year  I also was able to have dinner with Steve, which was nice  Maureen  "
