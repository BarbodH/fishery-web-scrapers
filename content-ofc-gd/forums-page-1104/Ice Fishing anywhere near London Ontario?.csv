I have heard that Port Stanley may be a good place to go, but would love some input from anyone out there with some first hand experience.  I want to introduce my son to the joys of hard-water fishing!  Thank you in advance for your help!!"
145656,Riparian,2007-12-27 03:13:00,269,I belive your local yokels fish the fanshawe conservation area in the winter for pike and panfish.
145657,trapshooter,2007-12-27 03:20:00,1234,There's also the sharon dam out in Delaware for panfish.   Longpoint (Erie) has a lot of hut operators in the perch grounds.  Go see Steve at Lambeth Rod/Tackle for some suggestions and gear you'll need.
145716,shane,2007-12-27 15:51:00,652,There's also Wildwood lake up by St. Marys.  I've never been but I have heard that it's pretty popular.  Can't say that I've ever heard  of ice-fishing at Pt. Stanley.
