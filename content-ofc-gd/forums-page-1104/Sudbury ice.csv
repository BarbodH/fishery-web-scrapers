144630,xrap,2007-12-22 19:29:00,683,"I'll be making a ice fishing trip next weekend to a lake in sudbury, just wondering how most of the ice is on the lakes thier. Just want to make sure it's worth the 4-5 hour drive before I find out the lake isn't frozen. Thanks in advance"
144640,FishFinder,2007-12-22 20:21:00,481,name of the lake would help
144648,xrap,2007-12-22 21:04:00,683,Lake X....
144649,irishfield,2007-12-22 21:08:00,26272,Well that sure isn't going to help get info Xrap. Huge difference between lakes up there... deep/shallow/large/windswept etc.  Best I've heard anywhere is 10 inches on a few lakes up there...and as little as 2 inches... as well as a few that are still wide open water. So without you narrowing down your lake...nobody is gonna have any help for you. Have a nice drive..hope you do well.
144650,FishFinder,2007-12-22 21:10:00,481,well put wayne
144658,misfish,2007-12-22 22:00:00,29133,"Lake X,.........................I believe many herehave been there.Sorry pal,Hate to put you on a spot,,,,,,,,,,,Xnotsafe."

144663,xrap,2007-12-22 22:44:00,683,"well I jsut better pray that its frozen, if not are thier any other lakes that you can ice fish this time of year?"
144666,pigeonfisher,2007-12-22 23:07:00,696,"If you can't fish there, Maybe hit Lake X!!!"
144672,FishFinder,2007-12-22 23:41:00,481,I hear lake Y has good ice this time of year
144685,xrap,2007-12-23 01:35:00,683,  right.....
144760,The Urban Fisherman,2007-12-23 14:35:00,2050,"Hey X-rap - I grew up in sudbury but the only ice fishing I ever did was for lakers on Lake Wanapetei and I'm pretty sure it's still wide open!  If you do make it out let us know how the trip goes!  I love hearing reports from ""the home land""...  Good Luck, UF"
144782,walleyejigger,2007-12-23 16:01:00,876,"i know a few folks with their huts on the ""village"" of vermillion lake, the road has been plowed on the lake for about a week and alot of people driving on it, pickeral are supposed to be bitin pretty good right now, 12"" ice some spots 10""  rained like crazy yesterday and still today so don't know what that's gonna do  been workin like a basturd lately and until the new year so haven't been able to get out, hopefully by the 2nd"
145384,Northhunter,2007-12-26 01:21:00,214,"Most of the smaller lakes north of the city (towards Gogama) are running 8-12"". Those are the only ones I've hit (no fish - 1 pike and two flags in 3 trips). About half of that is ""white"" ice because of the storm that blew through right after the first good freeze. The rain actually helped some lakes, as it melted any snow that was left on top and that is freezing with the colder temps. Our lake was ""booming"" last night as everything was tightening back up.  Have fun finding out what ""Lake X"" is like..."
