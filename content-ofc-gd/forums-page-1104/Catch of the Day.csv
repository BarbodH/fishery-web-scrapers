Hubby used a ""Silver/blue Williams Warbler"" as a flasher to bring perch in....And caught the biggest Damn Perch I have ever seen! Caught this about noon today, weighed 10 pounds and was 33 inches long.....   Oh and I thought I would put a plug in for Penny at D C Marina in Keswick...Talk to her today and she is trying really hard to get a permit so she can have a portable bait shop on the ice.....Application is in MNR......She really misses you guys! Doug is still repairing snowmobiles and atv's , give em a call! they would be glad to hear from you  Lorissa "
