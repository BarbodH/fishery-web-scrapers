145038,lew,2007-12-24 13:35:00,12767,"I pretty well worked either Christmas or New Years for about 37 years and now that I don't work anymore it's nice to be home for the entire holiday season.  Howz bout you, are you stuck with working over the holidays ??"
145040,motv8tr,2007-12-24 13:38:00,2587,"I was supposed to be working all of the holidays this year,and normally I don't mind working Christmas, as long as I get boxing day off.  A few things have happened in the last couple of weeks and I am unexpectedly off for the holidays now...sometimes that can be more exhausting than working  Maureen"
145042,Greencoachdog,2007-12-24 13:45:00,8163,Well yanno Lew....  fishing is hard work!  If done properly.
145045,Spiel,2007-12-24 13:48:00,9065,"....Not me, I have 14 days off (as of last Thursday). Back to work January 3rd."
145046,Mike the Pike,2007-12-24 13:48:00,3421,"Well I do have Monday,Tuesday and Wednesday off .I have been in the printing business for 21 years and have never worked at a company that shuts down until after New Years.  My Dad was a stationary Engineer for Bell for 32 years and I remember how many Christmas days we missed him cause he had to work so I am happy just to have the days off that my company provides.  My Mom's husband is a Captain in the Northbay Ontario Fire Dept and yes he sometimes works Christmas and New Years.So I know how it must have been for you sometimes Lew.  I remember my Dad would some times work all night then stay up all day with us on Christmas just to make sure our Christmas Day would be perfect.Thanks for thinking of the people who have to work on Christmas Lew.  MTP"
145048,Handlebarz,2007-12-24 13:56:00,3790,No we are lucky here Honda shuts down for the holiday so the 2nd will be my next day to work and that is only because they pay us double time and a half same as the last day of the year its hard to pass it up.  I love the fact that I can spend all the holiday with my family. Before i had kids I would work so that otehrs could have it off same as the wife we know now wh yit meant so much to the ones who got it off Kids make Christmas so special.
145054,TJQ,2007-12-24 14:23:00,7806,"Ill be putting a couple of hours in every day, Im sure..."

145058,Rich Clemens,2007-12-24 14:36:00,3131,"Our days off depend on when Christmas falls.   With Christmas being on a Tuesday, we were given both Monday and Tuesday off.  Taking last Friday as my final vacation day, I ended up with a 5 day week-end.  Cool beans."
145059,bucktail,2007-12-24 14:38:00,1857,Of course! The water never stops flowing to the people. But it's nice and quiet so I am not complaining.!

145106,DebS,2007-12-24 16:19:00,56,"Hi Lew,  People are still buying new cars for the holidays (wish I was on their gift list-LOL!) & still getting into fender-benders, even on Christmas Eve, so we're working half a day today, then off Dec 25 & 26, then back to work on Thursday.  I'll be spending Christmas Eve enjoying our traditional Cheese Fondue with the family, then a big Christmas dinner on Christmas day! Merry Christmas to all !!! DebS"
145109,Sandbag,2007-12-24 16:27:00,533,"For the first 15 years or so of my career I worked my share of Xmas and New Years Eve.  As MrEh mentioned, i didn't mins at all before I had kids.  Now I have the seniority that I need to spend Xmas day with my wife and four year old daughter.  Boy she's wound up today with friends and family coming over later this evening.  We just let her open an early gift so she has her own kids digital camera for the festivities.  Someone remind me to close the bathroom door from now on.  Merry Christmas all and for those of you working, especially in the Emergency Services.  Thank you  Cheers Craig"

Final day today, our president let us go at 2:45 pm, and we do not go back until Jan. 2nd.  Course, that day my life becomes a living hell again, lol.  I have had 2 whole days off since July 1st, other than about 4 days sick days(but those do not count).  I finally got out fishing since mid to late August just last saturday, caught squat, but I was out fishing, in the rain, then the snow, then the wet snow, lol, and may get out boxing day as well, but if that does not work out, this coming weekend for sure.
