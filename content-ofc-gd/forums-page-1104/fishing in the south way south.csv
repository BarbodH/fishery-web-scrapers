145752,irishfield,2007-12-27 17:17:00,26272,You'd better have some kick ass line and a long landing net... all I can say  !  ..seriously..what islands are you hitting?
145754,scuro,2007-12-27 17:20:00,386,"Will you have time on a Cruise? Forget ultralight...they will bend out normal Rapella hooks. Silver lures work, you will need a leader, and burn your lures. Poppers also work."
145942,lickmyarmpit,2007-12-28 02:24:00,359,"Belize cancun, than staying in the bahamas (paradise island) for a few days, packed an assortment of lures poppers as mentioned some jigs rattletraps and ol' standby hook and sinkers.  Found a real cool new shimano rod at action angling 7'0 five piece i could pack it in a carry on bag its so small cuz i dont think the 5' ugly stick was gonna cut it.  Does anyone know if i need a licence?"
145944,ecxstriper,2007-12-28 02:31:00,343,My suggestion would be large poppers and musky size jerk baits .
145945,irishfield,2007-12-28 02:32:00,26272,Some islands you need a licence.. some don't have a requirement. Should be able to do a quick search for each port of calls goverment site and it will tell you generally. Cancun I did a charter (you need a licence there)... 17 years ago... caught lots including a 6 foot sand shark. Haven't done the bahamas... did a deep sea charter in St. Martin with nothing but an empty beer cooler to show for the day...same deal in St. Lucia.
