145620,reelinrolly,2007-12-27 01:08:00,281,I was just wondering what everyones favourite setup was for pan fish adn pike?  I just ordered some stuff and want to know if im on track....lol
145625,Rizzo,2007-12-27 01:19:00,4754,"call it simple, but for pike I like to use a tip-up (orange pop up flag type) baited with a 5-6 inch minnow about 2 feet off bottom.  I use a split shot or 2 to prevent Mr Minnow from swimming back up the hole and tangling everything up.  I don't bother with the spreaders/2 minnows.  Sit back in my lawnchair, fire up the portable bbq and wait for the flag to pop.  Because I plan to release the fish, I set the hook as soon as possible, rather than waiting for the pike to stop, swim off again etc.  Don't catch them all, but successful release rate as far as I can tell is 100%"
145627,reelinrolly,2007-12-27 01:24:00,281,What sort of jigging setup would you  suggest though?..for pike
145643,Rizzo,2007-12-27 02:23:00,4754,"can't help you there as I have never actually expended the effort to jig for them, and have never even used a rod! (just the tip-up method or spool of line laying in the snow with a real small bobber to keep the bait off bottom).  I've done a very small amount of ice-fishing for perch, where I've got one jig that will be right on bottom, and a second jig about a foot up, both tipped with a minnow.  I use 4 lb test for this."
145648,trapshooter,2007-12-27 02:36:00,1234,"There's lots of options for jigging pike through the ice.  I like a spoon tipped with just the head of a shiner but a simple jig/minnow also works well.  If it's shiny and you can jig it, chances are a pike will at least take a look.  It's not rocket science, that's for sure.  Deadbait on bottom on a tip-up is key though.  Jig near by and in another hole and watch your flag.  Sometimes though with jigging less is more.  I like a lot of pauses and sometimes just a short jig thrown in.  Pike also cruise the entire water column so try on bottom, up 3' and so on until you are just below the ice.  You'd be surprised."
