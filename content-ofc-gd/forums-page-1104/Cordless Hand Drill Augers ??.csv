Actually, I looked at purchasing that auger, then I noticed how much ice it would drill through, and............................that thought was immediately dropped. We just get too much ice for it to be viable up here, even in our warmest temps for the year, which happens to be last year according to Environment Canada.  Still, the 2nd week in February, when our lake trout season opened last year, and we went fishing, I did not take my auger extension out with us, and we barely got through the ice  without it. Thats 36"" of auger bit before the power head, and we barely made it through on a couple of the lake trout lakes up here, despite our milder than normal temps.  That auger will just not, pardon the pun ""cut it"" up here, except for very early season ice, which is long past now. Maybe 3 weeks ago it could be used, but not now."

Seems like I have to buy one every time I go ice fishin'.  I don't think anybody was talkin' about trekking up to your nek of the woods to use the Micro, we have seen how the frost has bitten your brain... and we don't want to end up like that!"
