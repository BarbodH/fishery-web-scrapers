145769,Terry,2007-12-27 18:03:00,14456,"well I decided to  walk out on  cooks bay keswick side today I went to Harry's tackle at the river, the place was closed...so people if you minnows or tackle, get it before you come to Keswick as I walked to the edge of the ice I could see there was no snow on the ice and it looked like some cars/trucks had been on the ice.. it was tough walking, not only was it ice but it was uneven making walking difficult. I walk a fair way out,there were a few guys fishing near by I drilled a hole, with a manual auger...lots of ice, about 10"" but I only in 7' of water...it started snowing  I packed up and started walking out to deeper water, but the light snow coming down made  it  all but impossible to walk so I gave up and walked  to shore, man it was slipperly, I fell once but I saw two other guys walking and they must have fell 10 times so I felt good about only falling once....  I came up   on a spot were someone had fished, the  pig left a timmies cup on the ice, it's ok bud I took it off the ice for you  a couple of ATVs went by just as I got off a car drove on to the ice....  well I did learn I need cleats and my next trip will be with the atv       "
145772,Dondorfish,2007-12-27 18:19:00,1000,Thanks Terry - Guess that answers that question - I'll be up soon - but with the atv and cleats on the boots.   Thanks  Don
145775,mistyriver1,2007-12-27 18:25:00,600,"Thanks for the report Terry, nice to see some hard water reports starting.  It doesn't look like there were many folks out Terry, were there more people over on the Gilford side ?"
145776,medmart,2007-12-27 18:26:00,587,Good to see you got out terry i did to to Virginia beach same thing there the walk out was not bad but coming back in was a different story with the snow and i had cleats on and i was still sliding all over and when i left a guy with a pick up drove out to the huts  rob
145780,Joey,2007-12-27 18:46:00,9122,"Great, I was wondering when you were going to get your scared, lazy arse out there Terry  That's the info I was looking for too, thanks.  Joey"

145788,Terry,2007-12-27 19:18:00,14456,"glad you got out too rob  mistyriver1, I couldn't see that far, it was foggy and snowy"
145797,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-27 19:57:00,0,"You should have stayed closer to home. Went off of Gilford and did well. I brought home 50 fish in the 9 to 10"" with a few in the 12' range . 18fow was good today. Bottom 5 to 10' of water was full of fish. Through back at least 250 to get 50. Fast and furious first thing. Eys balls and maggots did the trick. Diners gonna be great. A quad would have been nice. 4plus inches as far as I walked."
145815,Terry,2007-12-27 20:57:00,14456,maybe I will need to walk out from gilford tomorrow is there anywhere to buy maggots near there..or minnows eyeballs I can get after I catch a few...LOL if I don't release them
145816,mistyriver1,2007-12-27 21:02:00,600,"You can buy minnows from Peter of Ice Cabins Terry, he's right at the end of Gilford road."
145817,addict,2007-12-27 21:05:00,475,lol i did that every yr till i bought some cheap cleats a wal-mart they work like a charm
145822,Terry,2007-12-27 21:21:00,14456,"good, I was afraid he would be out of minnows too  a real problem around here"
145825,Greencoachdog,2007-12-27 21:44:00,8163,"Great report and pics Terry!... but there seems to be something missing.......  I'm sure you'll get them next time!  I dunno about you, but whenever I go ice fishin' I've got so many clothes on that if I do fall down... it's like landing on a marshmallow. ... unless I land on my head, you see I have this piece of cheap government plastic...."
145843,fishindevil,2007-12-27 22:14:00,6254,"Well at least you got out terry..thanks for the report !!! too bad it was rough walking i hate when its like that,it hurts my back bad !!!  ...well thanks for the heads up,as on sunday i will bring my cleets for sure !!!!!...better luck next time terry....cheers"

145874,Fisherman,2007-12-27 23:18:00,7201,"Yes, it was a great day on the ice if you were wearing cleats or chains, chiropractors will be making money shortly.  Tomorrows supper caught fresh today. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twRjfFCXcfk"

145877,Terry,2007-12-27 23:24:00,14456,cool where does everyone park  around there
145879,Fisherman,2007-12-27 23:41:00,7201,"Straight back up on Gilford Rd about 120M or on the next side street, Nelly St I think it's called, pretty easy walk."
145890,Terry,2007-12-28 00:21:00,14456,thanks I will go tomorrow and play
145907,Fisherman,2007-12-28 01:04:00,7201,"Forgot to mention, they are pretty hard with the parking tickets, don't park within 10M of an intersection, only on one side of the road, etc, I'm sure you'll see the rest."
145925,Sinker,2007-12-28 01:47:00,8692,"Well, I went down twice  I was towing my 2 man, with my son in it!! he laughed his ass off every time I slipped.....Great day for him out there today. We caught a bunch, kept 16 nice ones for dinner. Just ate them  Found the same ice  you did......around 8"" give or take. Plenty safe. Casey's Huts was running huts out......had around 6 or 8 ready to go that I could see. They're running argo's for now, but getting the bombadier ready! It was ice as far as I could see from georgina to Thorah.....looks good.  Sinker"
