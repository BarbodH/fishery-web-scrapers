They have restocked and will be opening the first week in Jan 08.  They will be selling live bait. This is not to advertise, but to inform. If you guys and gals go in ask for Mike that's my Dad he'll look after you!"

145566,misfish,2007-12-26 22:03:00,29133,Interesting TY
145603,Corey,2007-12-26 23:46:00,355,I'm sure as with others we get an OFC discount of 10% with our OFC stickers on our vehicles?
145686,fishboy,2007-12-27 13:13:00,550,"cool...do you know if he plans to have emeralds & if so, how much per dozen (mediums)?"
145692,glen,2007-12-27 13:48:00,2641,So the old owners of Pete's retired???  The people at Epps have been very nice every time i have been there.  I hope they do well.  The store is in the perfect location for anyone going north on #11.  Its north of Orillia about 8 miles.  Thankyou for the update mtpockets2.
145702,camillj,2007-12-27 14:43:00,1988,Thanks for the info ... its getting harder to find minnows these days ... wish him our best !
145737,johnnyb,2007-12-27 16:37:00,3413,"That is really good to know...thanks for posting!   2 questions:  Will they be open any later on Friday/Saturday nights? (it seemed to me that Pete's was always open a bit later than Epps) and, more importantly, will Harold still be up on the wall?"
145915,mtpockets2,2007-12-28 01:28:00,12,From what I herd from dad there will only be a couple guys workin in there. So not quite sure of the hours but I will mention stayin open later Friday night for the people headin north.
145959,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-28 03:03:00,2585,cool good to know!  thanks for the info.  Cheers!
145960,Garyv,2007-12-28 03:07:00,547,Elwood Epps is a must stop anytime I'm driving up #11...the place is a classic fishing and hunting store dating back many years.  If they do something they usually do it right.
