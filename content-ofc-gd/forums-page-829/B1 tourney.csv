354398,Roy,2009-06-22 13:08:00,13728,I think it was Andre Laforce with a  7lb 2oz
354402,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-22 13:22:00,2038,Lunker = 7lb.2oz  Monster Lmb ...
354407,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-22 13:45:00,3761,"7.2lbs ?? Wow, a lunker indeed. Can't wait to see a photo of the catch, I'm sure it will end up on here soon enough. Where was this tourny held cause I thought Bass was still closed in many areas in Ontario."
354417,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-22 14:25:00,2038,Montreal area.....Opened on the 19th
354423,darsky,2009-06-22 14:35:00,586,I caught the weigh in-was actually quite exciting. The Montreal boys in the lead on day 1 were the last to weigh in on day 2. All eyes were on the scale and it finally showed a 5 oz lead over the current leader. First prize was over 21000. Also the live release %  for both days was 99.3  .
354542,misfish,2009-06-22 21:41:00,29133," Cant ask for better then that,well you could,but that is a great percentage.   Thanks for posting."
354630,Greencoachdog,2009-06-23 01:29:00,8163,"  But how many were snatched off of their bed, transported miles away from said bed ... subjected to weigh in procedures and released miles away from the aforementioned bed???   ... not to mention the week of OOS prefishing/bed snatching!!!   ... and to think, some people wanted to brow-beat poor little Stonefly for catching a few little ol' Smallies off of the end of his dock!"
354638,msp,2009-06-23 01:51:00,1336, Your the one that asked about the tourney? And now your the one slamming the guys that are fishing within the regulations. When does your bass season open down there ? Oh yeah........thats what I thought.
354644,Greencoachdog,2009-06-23 02:02:00,8163,"  What's a ""Bass Season""... do you mean like flour, garlic salt, and pepper???"
354656,Cudz,2009-06-23 02:48:00,2652,lol. and a little paprika for extra zing.
