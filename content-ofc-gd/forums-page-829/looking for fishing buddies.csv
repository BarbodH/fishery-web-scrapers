He has a cottage (or trailer) in camp Ashtibula and hands out their flyer if you talk about fishing while in the chair. He is a fantastic guy and knows the spots. He has been up there for ever so I am sure you'll find him by asking around. I am considering renting a cottage from them in fall. I will look forward to your fishing reports. Jim"
