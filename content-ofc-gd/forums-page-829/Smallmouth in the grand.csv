354826,Lebomb,2009-06-23 17:37:00,1,Hey does anyone know any good spots to get big smallmouth in the grand between shand dam and paris dam? I have fished a bit inbetween but not too too extensively since i find a good spot to drop a canoe.
354838,ozaibak1,2009-06-23 18:16:00,401,"Prepare to get flamed, no one is going to give you a spot off of your first post and without an introduction..."
354846,dannyboy,2009-06-23 18:34:00,367,"Lots of good places to fish on the Grand, but like many places the location of the fish changes with the water conditions, weather and season, a lure or spot that is good one day is dead the next. The nice thing about a canoe is you can drift and cast along the shore and any structure, near the dams can also be productive.  Dan"
354857,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-23 19:19:00,1022,"I have caught a smallmouth in york once, but that was years ago."
354870,crappyfisherman,2009-06-23 19:49:00,35,"im not to sure about the area's your talking about, but ive had lots of luck with the bass in dunville by the damn, or below it,  ive always get a couple around cayuga, or york like the last guy was talking about, as well, i always have a good time in calidonia right at the damn, doesnt matter if your above it or below it!   good luck and have fun!~"
354876,purekgw,2009-06-23 20:08:00,585,there are tons of smallmouth all over the grand just go find them
354890,timmeh,2009-06-23 20:51:00,609,"No one's going to give up exact spots like that on an online forum but they're in there throughout most of the river. Just drop the canoe in somewhere and take your time and fish.  Keep in mind there are several sections of the Grand with special fishing regs. Catch and release only, as well as no live bait and barbless hooks. Make sure to check out the regs before you fish the Grand.  Good luck"
354904,splashhopper,2009-06-23 21:35:00,2931,  I would try the wet areas.
354927,ch312,2009-06-23 22:39:00,1590, thats what i was thinking. i dont think ive found a place in the grand where i couldnt catch smallies. you gotta be doin something really wrong if you cant catch decent smallies in the grand
354931,danbouck,2009-06-23 22:56:00,4380,There are no bass in the grand!
354941,joonmoon,2009-06-23 23:27:00,528,As a true Jedi would say....those aren't the bass you're lookin for.
355030,bassmaster4,2009-06-24 02:54:00,801,go to belwood lake conservation area and fish below the dam some decent smallmouth in there or go a bit further down into the river with waders and cast some spinners or something
355083,Trevor0179,2009-06-24 11:26:00,65,no one is going to give this information up there is a smallmouth bass turnament in a few weeks and it just so happens that the fishing zone is after the shand dam up to the paris dam. are you planning on attend this turnament?
355087,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-24 11:40:00,1022,"  Agreed. I have only caught one ever, and I have fished the grand for 15 years."
