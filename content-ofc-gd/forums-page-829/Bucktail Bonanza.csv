354628,Joeytier,2009-06-23 01:26:00,3990,"This spring has been awful for walleye for me this year.  Multiple skunkings and one fish days have been the norm.  It took until one of the very last days of spring to finally get a good day.  And what a day it was.  The wind was very cooperative for a change, which made fishing very easy.  We fished for around 4 1/2 hours, fishing one giant weed flat in the middle of the lake.  There was a line of super thick weeds in about 10 ft, and as soon you as we found slightly deeper water (12-14 ft) with more scattered weeds the walleye would soon follow.  We managed 13 fish, and every single one was at least 16"" with many reaching (and a few exceeding) the 3 lb mark.  Easily the best walleye fishing I've ever experienced, and it was in the middle of the afternoon, on a bright calm, sunny day.  This time of year, I think they prefer sunny hot weather as opposed to what people usually associate with prime walleye conditions.  11 of the 13 were caught on bucktails, with the other two being taken on a black tube.      ...And the double header shot.

It seems to me that, that lake is getting better and better later in the season. Not to mention all the other giants in that lake. Good going, thanks for the report."
354652,WeedLine,2009-06-23 02:32:00,322,"In my opinion when the clouds look like they do in your pics, the fishing tends to be good."
354666,Sinker,2009-06-23 04:12:00,8692," I agree with that for sure. I could post a whole whack of fish pics with those ""popcorn"" clouds. Next best would be rainy, windy days.  Its been slow to get going, but we've been doing well on the eyes so far. Things are starting to shape up though. The summer pattern is shaping up.  Nice fish Joey, real nice!!  Sinker"
354714,woodro,2009-06-23 11:40:00,168,"nice job Joey, I had a day similar to that last week in the exact same structure. Weeds with a 12-14ft drop off.   Did you get a read on the water temps?"

354810,Joeytier,2009-06-23 16:59:00,3990,The hot calm weather had the water up to around 75 by the time we left.
