353946,Jonny,2009-06-20 19:05:00,1380,"After I recently had a letter to the editor published by the North Bay Nugget re: cormorants, I was contacted by one of the directors of an organization which I had not been aware of... the Ontario Outdoors Recreational Alliance.  He sent me some materials about a number of issues a few days ago, including some about public access, an issue that was near and dear to my heart when I was the president of a Timmins conservation club and a director of the OFAH, and an issue on which the MNR would not budge.  It's an issue that just won't go away, and in some areas it's actually worse than stated in the OntORA access pamphlet. In the Chapleau area, the MNR a number of years ago set up ""Remote Tourism Areas"" that actually ban ALL public fishing in waters within the zones, whether you can walk to them or not. If you park your vehicle at one of the closure signs and walk in to a trout stream within a zone, even though you may be miles from a fly-in lodge you cannot fish it legally. "
353976,johnnyb,2009-06-20 20:27:00,3413,wow.  sucky.  what can we do?
353981,Jonny,2009-06-20 20:44:00,1380," Make some noise, I guess. Be aware and make some noise. And watch for any expansion of the program and complain like hell to the right people if you see anything similar being proposed. But don't count on getting anywhere.  This tends to be a Northern Ontario issue because it's used to protect ""remote"" lakes for toursit outfitters. But it can impact Southern Ontario fishermen who travel to the north as well. Lakes and entire areas that are ""off limits"" tend to concentrate more pressure on lakes not included in the zones. There are also roads in non-posted areas where culverts are dug up or bridges demolished so that outdoorsmen can't access the opportunities.  Lovely for the MNR though... it prevents fishermen from spreading out and being even less regulated than they already are by the ridiculously low number of C.O.'s that are fielded. It ALSO impacts hunters, moose hunters in particular.  The MNR plays nice little games when they make a proposal and ask for input. If I wrote a protest letter on behalf of the 80,000 member OFAH to Chapleau MNR (which I did), it counted as one response. If Joe Blow tourism guy wrote a private letter in favour of the closure, it counted as one response.  Put ""for"" and ""against"" on a pie chart (which the MNR did) and hey, guess what? It seems there are as many people in favour as opposed.  Don't kid yourself, the MNR will not move on issues where they don't want to move. Do I sound cynical? After years of experience... you bet! They don't embarrass easily, they will listen patiently and make sympathetic noises, and then they will do what they originally set out to do."
354447,Jonny,2009-06-22 16:10:00,1380,"Like in a lot of areas, the MNR (government) relies on short attention span and NIMBY to defuse criticism of poor policy.  Something like pike in the Kwarthas eventually meets the same fate as access elitism in the North.  A flurry of criticism dies out after the MNR holds meetings and accepts letters, and then it's back to business as usual for them. Any bureaucrat loves nothing more than to be left alone."
354453,TDunn,2009-06-22 16:20:00,680,Hhhhmmmmm.....Chapleau is my favorite place in the world....havent ran into any of these zones yet but I will be keeping an eye open...and yes I will be opening my mouth if I ever see this.....thanks for the info on this matter.....I am actually in the works of setting up a guide service up near that area and this is definitly something I need to know about.....Thanks    TDunn
354498,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-22 18:55:00,0,"this has been a MAJOR issue the last few years north of white river.  same deal... some lakes even have access roads going into them but they are for remote tourism only... definitely a kick in the teeth...  that said, the economy of white river/chapleau is reliant upon the HUGE dollars brought in by this tourism, and obviously the provincial government makes a killing on non resident licensing and tax dollars.  i'm actually for setting up conservation areas and limiting access, but not in the name of protecting tourism outfitters... i'll never endorse the ""nature for those who can afford it"" concept."
354513,bushart,2009-06-22 19:59:00,2628,"Well, Well, well.....  Wonder how this story plays into access to navigible waterways---remember the story Bill M told about landowners-around that saugeen creek-and that if you can run a canoe on it your gold.  I guess it's true...""All pigs are created equal but some pigs are more equal than others"".  I seen this crap going on in the past with outfitters putting their US hunters on stands on ""CROWN"" land and them getting upset when Joe the Canadian deerhunter walks under his treestand.  Bushart"
354549,Jonny,2009-06-22 22:09:00,1380," The problem with these areas is that they protect not only fly-in lakes with outpost camps on them, but deny fishing opportunities, through existing or future timber access roads, to entire areas - creeks, small lakes, forest good for hunting.   I can buy lots of things if they treat all users of the resource equally. So it sounds like we're much the same.   I have seen too many examples of outfitters thinking that they have a right to a resource and nobody else does. Not only that, but they think that, for them, time stands still. What was a remote area once might not be a remote area in 20 years, but they still think they should be the only ones with access. It's OK if everybody else gets squeezed, as long as they can maintain their ""preserve""."
