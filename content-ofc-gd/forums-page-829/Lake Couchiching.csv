The cottage comes with a tin can with a 9.9hp so we plan on doing a lot of fishing next week!!! The weather looks like it will be good. I'm making the trip to Bass Pro on Friday morning to stock up the tackle box. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. We're taking the Sympatico Portable Internet up with us so I'll be posting pics and updates throughout the week. My 6 year old is more excited about the minnow trap we got than anything else!!!. My daughter heard her brother say we're going to bait it with cat food so she's expecting us to catch a cat in it!!!  Anyhow hope its a good week. Any suggestions about good places to fish would be appreciated to.  Cheers,  J"

Small spinners, small-medium size plastics for the perch, minnows, worms and you'll be OK. Lot's of good bass locations are available."
