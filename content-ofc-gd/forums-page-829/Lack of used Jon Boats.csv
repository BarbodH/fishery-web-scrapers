354772,Fisherman,2009-06-23 15:08:00,7201,"When it gets a bit wavey and rough, in my experience, they are not the most stable.  Maybe if they were a bit wider, but most don't have enough freeboard to keep the waves out."
354789,Flappn,2009-06-23 15:54:00,245,"Stability isn't the issue, it's the ability to be able to run rougher/chopy water with a flat fronted boat and in Ontario we have a lot of large lakes. Deep V's handle the rough water a lot better.  John boats are made for smaller calm lakes and rivers. People use them alot for Utility type purposes as well."
354791,Fisherpete,2009-06-23 16:02:00,1814,"I would say that most people who buy Jon boats use them for a very specific purpose, ie hunting, shallow water fishing, and don't really need (or have many options) to upgrade. With deep V style boats, there is always something bigger and better out there that we ""just gotta have"", and upgrade. The fact that Jon boats are relatively cheap also probably plays a part in the equation."

354920,Musky or Specks,2009-06-23 22:22:00,2710,Like a canoe a jon boat is dirt cheap and you probably bought it for a specific purpose. They dont get upgraded and if you sold yours youd have to get another one to do the same stuff. Once guys buy em they keep em
