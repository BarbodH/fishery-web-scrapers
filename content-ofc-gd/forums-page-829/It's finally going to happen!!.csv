I tried in 2007 to make something happen, but being one of very few in Ontario who used a kayak as their primary mode of fishing....  and then again last year(some of you may remember my post), I was so hopeful of making it happen only to have it dashed by too few anglers willing to commit.  Now in 2009 with the population of yakfishers doubling and tripling the past few years, it is going to happen and it's gonna be BIG! Please see Announcements and Contests for details."
302580,diggyj,2009-02-07 00:53:00,548,Looks like a great event. Nice to see something for kayakers finally. Congrats.
302585,misfish,2009-02-07 00:58:00,29133,I cant wait to watch the blast off.LOL  Well done.
302762,Chris,2009-02-07 13:47:00,405,Great just what we need......agressive tournament kayakers putting added pressure on the fishery and cutting you off on the water.   Just joking   .....good luck with the tourney!
302805,NAC,2009-02-07 15:44:00,369," a spectacle to behold, it will be!"
302851,Mike the Pike,2009-02-07 18:19:00,3421,So how will it work no livewell  Hope nothing will be dragged around on a chain.Perhaps a boat will hone in and take measurements or do you take a pic and go with the honour system.  WTG sounds like it will be a great tournament
303255,NAC,2009-02-08 13:37:00,369,"C-P-R Mike...  catch, photo, release all the way. Everyone will get a standard measuring devise upon sign-in and it must be used in the photo."
303260,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-08 14:08:00,2585,interesting.  how many kayaks are there going to be battling it for 1/3hp paddle supremecy?  all kidding aside it does sound like fun!  Cheers!
303280,limeyangler,2009-02-08 15:12:00,5204,Excellent! i always wanted a kayak when i was in england to go sea fishing....a boat was really not an option.  Good luck guys!
304076,Crazyhook,2009-02-10 00:34:00,1154,"Can't wait! I will be bringing up 5 or 6 extra demo kayaks for anglers looking to try out this exciting sport.  Thanks Nomad, its going to be an awesome event"
304085,purekgw,2009-02-10 00:38:00,585,i cant wait to go counting down the days!
355092,NAC,2009-06-24 11:47:00,369,"It's two weeks away now folks and there are 2 - 16' high end fishing kayaks to be won, each valued over $1600, plus a pile of other gear.  We now have a website for the tourney Ontario Kayak Fishing Classic  There's going to be a bunch of boats there to demo for free if anyone is interested in just trying it out or seeing what it's all about."
355094,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-24 11:49:00,3761,I would like to see on how they can keep bass alive and healthy with plenty of Oxygen...Or a stringer through the gills can work too  Unless it's C&R but well i don't know how its gonna work...
355106,NAC,2009-06-24 12:25:00,369," It's actually C-P-R, but you'd know that if you read any of the post.  Read and react folks not the reverse. Just remember that a big reason 90% of us went to kayak from motorboat is conservation.  Here's what it's all about, Catch-Photo-Release:        "
355110,splashhopper,2009-06-24 12:34:00,2931,"I don't see a prize, for ""the wildest ride"" caught on video !  That little bass I caught while out on a kayak last year pulled me all over the narrow section of the Maitland river...  i can't imagine the thrill of being yanked around by something bigger on more open water..  Maybe give the winner of the wildest ride, an anchor or a drift sock ?  Have fun guys.  Splashhopper"
355111,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-24 12:39:00,3761, Ah CPR. Good to hear but I'm guessing that measurements are taken along with photos to prove your catch. Only can skip through that link you showed me.
