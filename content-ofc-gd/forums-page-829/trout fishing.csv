354515,BillM,2009-06-22 20:04:00,17367,"I wouldn't be stream fishing for trout until you've verified the stream temps.  If it gets to warm, you'll just end up killing them even if they are released."
354516,[email protected],2009-06-22 20:09:00,3,"i know, i was hoping for lake names, with good shore fishing areas. I should have been more specific"
354517,BillM,2009-06-22 20:13:00,17367,"Not many lakes around Barrie that hold trout, you should be looking out towards Haliburton if that's your plan."
354532,tonka,2009-06-22 20:57:00,13, Why is that? What temps are OK?
354544,wallacio,2009-06-22 21:52:00,475," Bill is referring to water temperatures - as a general rule of thumb, it's best to stop fishing for stream/river Trout once the water temperature reaches 70F."
