355036,wallacio,2009-06-24 03:09:00,475,"After fishing the major hatches intensively in May and early to mid June, I usually hang up the 4wt by this time of year as the water is normally too skinny and warm.   This year has been a pleasant exception with cool temperatures and ample precipitation (including a recent good soaking) so I decided to head out one last time before this heat wave shuts things down for July and most of August.  With the water being a bit high and slightly stained and still just on the cool side of 70F, the fish were very happy tonight including a few bigger ones that wanted to play!      "
355037,BillM,2009-06-24 03:09:00,17367,I hate you.    
355065,solopaddler,2009-06-24 07:08:00,8605,Right on!! Did you Cronzy 'em up?
355066,Roy,2009-06-24 07:33:00,13728,"What a beautiful fish they are. Yanno, I've probably caught every species of North American freshwater fish and lots of saltwater but for some reason I just never got a brown. Maybe I'll pick one up before I hit the BIG gates.  Congrats to you."
355085,splashhopper,2009-06-24 11:35:00,2931,beautiful fish.  wtg
355107,wallacio,2009-06-24 12:28:00,475," Naw, they are back in their lairs...safe and sound."
355122,setomonkey,2009-06-24 12:58:00,872,"Congrats on some nice browns.  Roy, I'm sure you'll get your brown one of these days, I've been lucky and caught a few. Though I don't fish for trout often, I think they are the prettiest fish. Sorry bass & musky guys.  Mike"
355124,troutologist,2009-06-24 13:00:00,951,"Nice fish Dave, those colours are awesome."
355131,I'mHooked,2009-06-24 13:28:00,525," Well as mentioned in my introduction Roy, Brown's are the only non-Perch fish I've picked up in the last 24 years!    I guess I can cross them off the ""before the BIG gates list""  Beauty fish Dave! It's the only trout I've ever caught!... Although looking to expand my horizons."
355133,fish_finder,2009-06-24 13:31:00,370,  All in a days work!!!  Great job man!
355138,Musky or Specks,2009-06-24 13:39:00,2710,"Those are some nice trout. What was working? Dry, emerger?"
355145,wallacio,2009-06-24 13:52:00,475,"Thanks for the kind replies all.    All taken on nymphs (mostly Pheasant Tail variants, Copper Johns etc - anything that approximates Mayfly nymphs).   There weren't any hatches to speak of so the fish weren't looking up."
355156,kennyman,2009-06-24 14:12:00,737,"Man, do I envy you. B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L fish. My goal for this year is to catch a brown. I could sure use your expertise. Feel free to pm me with any helpful tips. Thanks for posting ................. gives me hope LOL."
355205,fishnsled,2009-06-24 16:48:00,3520,Very nice!
