I won't divulge his name as client confidentiality is important to me. I arrive at his home to do  some installs and repairs, he greets me with 5 magazines, cookbook and a 4-pack of DVD's. I thought that was very nice of him, and I wanted to share it with you guys. This was the first time I had met the man and all I did was mention in our intial conversation that I enjoyed makeing fish laugh at me. Then he gives me this stuff, what a guy!"
