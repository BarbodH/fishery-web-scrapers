353725,Big Cliff,2009-06-19 23:22:00,6899," Saw my Dr. last week, asked her how long she thought I might have.  She said ""do you smoke? I said No Do you drink? I said once in a while Do you play golf? No! Do you gamble? Not really What about sex? Well, when I get the opportunity!  She looked at me long and hard and said: ""why the heck would you want to prolong it for?""  (she never asked about the really important things: fishing, food, good friends. Dumb Dr.!)"
