We carried the 12' boats down to the lake, attached the 4Hp motors and were off. First cast produced a 21 incher for me....and so it went on...and on. Lots of jackfish too....always fun. I could go into huge detail....lol...but wont. I was using a hammered gold Beetlespin witha yellow 3/8 jig, and chuck was using a hammered gold walleye spinner, both tipped with a live minnow. Most of the fish were caught on the wind swept shoreline in 12' to 3' FOW. Chuck and myself must have thrown back over 20 fish, the majority over 19"".....with the best going to me at 23""......man these guys were fighting hard!   Here's the pics/videos from our morning.    WALLEYE VIDS       ALWAYS LOTS OF PIKE      SOME PICS                                            HAD A BLAST......CANT WAIT TO GO AGAIN     -Cheers -"
