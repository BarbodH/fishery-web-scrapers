Wanted to get the Oakley's but the lenses were real expensive and it would of taken 10days to make, so well save those beauties for next year in the mean time I got myself some good glasses that I like.  Ah, at last a good day fishing without a headache at the end. I'm sure I'll be catching some fish during my trip and I'll be proud to wear them   MTBF"
354602,BillM,2009-06-23 00:38:00,17367,I dunno how anyone fishes without polarized sunglasses.  You'll never fish without them.
354608,Greencoachdog,2009-06-23 00:49:00,8163,Polarized glasses are the real ticket for snatching Bass off of their beds!!!... in or out of season!!!   If they aren't the real expensive ones.. you'll only see half as many bedding Bass as you would with the top dollar ones.
354609,Hellfish,2009-06-23 00:51:00,308,   hrmmm seems someone has been hitting the bottle extra heavy tonight
354612,Greencoachdog,2009-06-23 00:55:00,8163,"  I prefer to call it ""truth serum""!!!"
354613,Hellfish,2009-06-23 00:57:00,308,  yeeehawww
354678,GoneFishin,2009-06-23 04:46:00,349,How mcuh did you end up paying for them if you don't mind me asking? I'm looking for a decent pair and thought it might be worth a trip to an eye specialist.
354680,mbac31,2009-06-23 05:04:00,904, LMAO
354709,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-23 11:27:00,3761," I had to pay for the frames and got a 50% discount on the lenses(latest promotion) + i got them polarized and they were $285. The Oakleys were brand lenses or whatever she said so the discount would not be in effect so the price of those will be in upwards of $400+.   However, Im very happy with my pair and you should be able to find something that will be good for you, good luck!"
354711,bigugli,2009-06-23 11:30:00,6138,I cheaped out and bought a pair of polarized wrap arounds for my glasses.  $40 rather than $750 for a new pair of polarized script lens
354736,Beans,2009-06-23 13:09:00,3339," Like you, I grabbed a pair of ""Fitovers"" at our local Tackle shop...$19.99  Seem to work OK !"
354742,ricoboxing,2009-06-23 13:46:00,398,"i got the rapala ones from walmart. costs around $14. no way i would spend more as i always lose them, break them, or scratch them. i also use them as everyday sunglasses."
354744,Raf,2009-06-23 13:59:00,3495,i splurged on a pair of costa del mars this year - never did i think i'd spend this much but i'm real happy with them and they are certainly head & shoulders above the 'el cheapos' i've been using in the past.
354758,bdox,2009-06-23 14:47:00,329, That changes real fast when you're spending $300 on a pair of sunglasses. I have polarized Oakleys that have lasted me 4 years already.
354773,TDunn,2009-06-23 15:12:00,680,Bolle has my vote for glasses......   TDunn
