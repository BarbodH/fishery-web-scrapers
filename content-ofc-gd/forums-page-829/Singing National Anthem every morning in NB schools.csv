I pledge my allegiance to humanity first, countries with man created borders second thank you very much.  I don't need to sing the national anthem to pay respects to my country, if I feel like I want to that's my choice not yours. Just singing an anthem or waving a flag doesn't make you a patriot, it's your actions.  For the record I'm not decided either way on whether the anthem should be enforced or not, me personally I didn't mind it through school. And I love Canada for the record.  If someone sings the anthem everyday but is committing crimes for example, does that make them more patriotic than someone who doesn't sing it? True love for land and country comes from interacting with people and the environment, not necessarily from singing a song.  One of the great things about our country is freedom of choice, and if you can't respect freedom of choice for some, then you are against a basic tenet that this country was founded upon."

354892,Cookslav,2009-06-23 20:57:00,1457,"Some people are just hell bent on nonconformity....  If you tell them the rules, they have this deep need to break, change, or abolish them simply because it sets parameters, regardless of the reasons they are in place, and who they are meant to inspire, or exel. Luckily Most of these idiots end up in Jail by the time they are 20, but unfortunatly for us some find themselves with just enough common sence to stay out of trouble. They are easy to spot though... Generally they are quite miserable, alone and spend much time complaining on the internet in what is supposed to be their golden years...  Sure some might find it annoying to hear our anthem over and over, and some might find it annoying to be told they have to do something they don't like.... Suck it up. Maybe someday we should all stand up in unison and tell these   's  how  the majority of us normal folk find their complaining annoying. geeze...  IMO There is literally no acceptable reason to cancel the singing, and playing of the national anthem in our schools, and I think anyone who has an issue with it should take their kids out of the public school system and home school them....its my right to have my children educated in tradtional Canadian fashion. You don't like it...write book about it, or screw off theres plenty of countries on this little old rock so leave mine alone.  I guess I'm a wee bit defensive of my country, but I guess thats just Patriotism....who knows maybe 14 years of hearing that Anthem brainwashed me? Or Maybe I just find it odd how a few vocal miserable dude's can cause such ruckus sometimes.  Peace,"

354919,holdfast,2009-06-23 22:19:00,1813," That would be a Big Negative to you young fella.  I suppose you would be the Goof that sits down while others face the Flag for respect during the Anthem. ( Love to see you pull that stunt in the States)  Like it or not that flag is a symbol of the freedom that you enjoy.  That flag is a National Symbol.  I ask you, nicely, How in the world would you compare Canadian Nationality, Did you not agree we did the right thing to fight Hitler, to the Nazis and say the Revolutionary Guard in IRAN.  Betcha when you tour outside North America you have a Canadian Flag stuck on the Knapp sac.  by the way you dont have to sing it either to respect the anthem, chances are you dont even know the words and what they mean any hoot."

354951,ozaibak1,2009-06-24 00:04:00,401,"Hi Holdfast, your last post was completely disrespectful and emotional. Learn when you're having discussion to use facts, and not name call. Calling me a goof out of emotion does not reflect well on your personality.  What may surprise you is most of the things you've said about me are completely false. This is because you associated me with whatever group of people you hate, and I'm not really sure why, can you specifically clarify what I said in my original post that turned you blue?  To clarify to you: I am not a goof, I do respect the anthem, I do recognize the flag as a symbol of my country, I don't wear a Canadian flag on my knapsack when I travel outside the country, I do know the words to the anthem in English as well as French, I do not want it to be canceled in the schools, and I never said countries don't need borders.  Perhaps you took the fact that I pledge allegiance to humanity before a country offensive? Why is that? That doesn't mean my country is not very important to me as well, but you seem to deduce that I hate Canada and don't know anything about it? What kind of logic are you following?  To come out with all of these allegations is downright disrespectful, and shows you are an emotionally charged man. My point is 'freedom' means having a choice. I personally like the anthem, but when people start enforcing ideas and ridiculing or threatening those who don't agree with them (as you have, even though I didn't disagree with you), that reminds me of tactics used by some not so favorable regimes."
354965,Puckhead,2009-06-24 00:33:00,377," Last time I checked, there was no ""humanity"" consulate available to you when in a foreign country, if - god forbid, you ever needed help...  Believe me, if you ever needed it, you'd be singing our anthem all the way home.  I don't get around here much anymore but do lurk occasionally - Holdfast just has his own special way with words... I personally appreciate his love for country so don't take it personally."

354390,holdfast,2009-06-22 12:27:00,1813,"Who ever stopped the Singing of the National anthem in schools and why.  I sang it everyday in Elementary school in Quebec.  At least I know the words.  The New Brunswick Minister I think says it right.  Speaking in the provincial legislature, Lamrock said the national anthem provides teachers with an opportunity to instill values of citizenship in students.  ""It is absolutely important in every school that we remind our children that to be citizens means that they are a part of something larger than themselves,"" he said.  What gets me is the stupid reasons some of these guys have for not wanting it.  Check out the CBC comments.  Pretty disturbing.  http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/sto...#socialcomments"
354393,wallyboss,2009-06-22 12:45:00,1095,I can't believe some of the comments in there!!!! I see no reason why it souldn't be sang in every Elementary School in the country!!!!

Idiots.  sidenote: when we said the lords prayer in school, some of the kids with different backgrounds/religions simply went into the hallway while it was said.  After it was over, they came back in.....  no drama, no whining, no nothing."
354397,Governator,2009-06-22 12:56:00,879,"I have strong feelings about this.  We sang the national anthem in elementary school from grade 1-6 and then we went to Junior High for 7-8 and my friend and I immediately started singing along with the morning anthem and we both got a DETENTION!!  Yes, we got a DETENTION for singing the anthem.  The teacher claimed we were making fun of our national anthem, when in fact we were taught to sing it for 6 years up to that point.  Nice way to start a new school on Day 1.  Complete Bull and from that point on ward I obviously never sang it again."

354437,NAW,2009-06-22 15:35:00,4022,So many different opinions out there eh.  Keep the song every morning!  The kids need it.  I was pretty steamed when I first heard about this issue a few months back.
354461,bigugli,2009-06-22 16:42:00,6138,"The more we sell out our country, the less we have to be proud of. In the hearts of far too many Canadians there is no patriotism or loyalty. I read it on this board frequently enough. Sadly, all Canadians are responsible for such a pathetic attitude. We tolerate it and allow it to thrive. A ""Hyphen-Canadian"" is a serious mistake. It says I love Canada for the opportunities, but that's it.  Our society, today, has far too many non voters, non conformists, separatists, wanna be Americans, and bottom feeders, and not enough who are proud to be Canadian come hell or high water. The problem is even worse within our governments.  Real Canadians, in New Brunswick, should have taken matters in hand when this problem first arose and fired every buffoon in the school board responsible, or supportive, of such an unpatriotic policy. Our nation's children should have teachers who will teach them to be proud of this land and the citizenship it bestows upon them. No person should be allowed to take office or hold authority for Canada without taking the loyal oath.  Yes I am a rabidly loyal Canadian "
354485,Billy Bob,2009-06-22 17:54:00,5865,We said the Pledge of Allegiance every morning when I went to private and public school MANY moons ago. I continue to say it PROUDLY at every Fire Hall Meeting or event.

354557,Jonny,2009-06-22 22:29:00,1380,"Throughout my 34 year teaching career in Northern Ontario my students stood at attention and sang the national anthem every morning. As a matter of fact, every once in a while, when the office would play a new version on the P.A., there would be complaints if it was a version that was hard to sing to!  Not only that, but in the halls (kids late for class), and in the office, everyone stopped and stood still for the anthem, even if they might not sing it.  That's the way it should be - showing some respect for a minute or two.  I used to love how my kids' karate classes started too - a moment to think of family, country, and God.  When my wife and I first moved to Timmins, the movie theaters would play the national anthem before the first showing. Everyone would stand. I wonder if that happens anywhere any more.  It always seemed to me that there was more respect for the old traditions, up north."

And I always stand attention and remove my hat at hockey, baseball, and basketball games and get disgusted when I see someone with theirs still on. And I dont do because I was ""programmed"" to do it. I think Jocko got it right, to me its more of a respect thing. There's so many who've given so much for this country that the least I can do is stand for a couple minutes to show my respect for that and all that I have because of it."

354732,holdfast,2009-06-23 12:43:00,1813, Agreed and since when was Nationalism was a bad thing.  Singing the National Anthem is paying respect to your Country.  Again the New Brunswick Minister couldn't put it in better words.
354770,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-23 15:06:00,10439," I have to agree. When I go abroad I respect the rights and traditions of the places I go and would expect those that come here do the same. I'm not saying that those that come here from other countries should have to leave their old life behind, far from it. But I think that they should learn something about the new country they now call home and participate in those traditions we hold dear. Maybe then they will stop feeling like outsiders. It's also on us Canadians to welcome the new comers and teach them what it means to be a Canadian, hockey, good beer and all!!!!! FYI, I'm one of those people that weren't born here, but I consider Canada MY home and I would want to live no where else. I also grew up singing the national anthem and saying the lords prayer in school."
354812,Bob,2009-06-23 17:09:00,370,"When I started school, the ritual was ""the lord's prayer"", ""Oh Canada"" and ""God Save The King"".  Things have changed a might since then. The prayer was abolished (ok by me), the monarch has changed and so have the words to the anthem.  Of course, the words to the anthem that I learned 60 years ago were nothing like the original version as written in french over a hundred years ago.  C'est la vie, I guess.  I'm a proud Canadian but often not too proud of our politicians."
354832,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-23 18:01:00,0,"while i'm very happy they took the lord's prayer out of our schools, i can't see a single reason to take out our national anthem.  i can see how the lords prayer would be silly to have in a public school considering the wonderful diversity of our country, but paying respect to the country we all love can do nothing but bolster positive things in our youth, hopefully causing them to respect and love the land in which we live."
