I'm heading back up in a couple days with the family so don't have time for a formal report. I'll leave the full story for Bill to tell, he's got a bunch more pictures and some pretty funny video clips that hopefully he'll post.  Until then here's a short preview:  Bill's dad Frank with a decent pike:     Billy with one of many topwater smallmouth:     Shorelunch:     281/2"" eye that I caught in the main lake:     Enroute to the landing:     Lining the canoe down the river into a back lake:     Bunk with a decent eye:     Billy with a bunch of eater walleye:     Thanks for the laughs boys, it was an epic trip!  Looking forward to the full story from Bill...  Cheers,  Mike"
354436,johnnyb,2009-06-22 15:30:00,3413,"Looks good so far...make with the report already, BillM"
354438,Victor,2009-06-22 15:46:00,1609,"Holy crap,  A trip with solo, moose + billm, the report is going to be E P I C !!!  definitely looking forward to it."
354469,lunkerbasshunter,2009-06-22 16:58:00,2585,great report those are some beuty fish you got into  cheers!
354478,BillM,2009-06-22 17:38:00,17367,"Well my dad and I have been looking forward to this trip for quite some time and we were not disappointed.  Even though the weather wasn't the greatest for fishing (30 degree temps, no wind) we managed some nice ones.  The drive up, not a cloud in the sky.    We loaded Mikes poor boat down quite a bit, but we made it!    Gorgeous views.    A nice little eye my oldman picked up at the end of the first day trolling a fire tiger shad rap in about 8ft of water...    A snake we picked up fishing a nice back bay full of weeds.    Shore lunch on Friday, consisting of a few small pike.     Thanks to my fish allergy, no fish for me!!!  MMmmmmm hotdogs and mushrooms.    Another small pike from the back lake    A view to our final portage of the trip..  This lake was long and deep, absolutely awesome.      The smallies were on fire, here is a nice example.    Another nice pike for the oldman, this one bit me off only a few mins before.  We were actually going to pick up the lure and saw the pike eyeing it from below.  A short cast and my dad nails it.    Thanks to a crappy shear pin, we get to tow Bunk and Mike home on Sat     Now the funny part....  This video consists of two separate days.  The first day we tried to hit a spot off of Mike's lake, this consisted of making our way over a beaver dam.  Well it looks like the beavers worked a bit of OT in the spring and Mike had an uphill battle, lol.  Second part of the video speaks for itself, a little handling mishap of a smallie lead to some curse words.  If you have young kids around, you might wanna mute the volume.  It's nothing to bad, but young ears don't need to hear my curse words.  "

354580,solopaddler,2009-06-22 23:26:00,8605, Oh boy that video was funny!  (But where's your report? Where's the story? C'mon man you can do better!)
354581,Dano,2009-06-22 23:30:00,719,"Ha ha, great stuff guys, looks like a ton of fun!"
354655,Cudz,2009-06-23 02:39:00,2652,wow. Nice pics and fish and scenery.  Looks like a great trip.
354669,yo_guy,2009-06-23 04:21:00,111,Man... I can't wait till this weekend for some topwater bass action... You guys got me all excited!!!
354952,aniceguy,2009-06-24 00:08:00,1094,classic video !!
354985,corvette1,2009-06-24 01:37:00,1765,nice trip guys good load of eyes for lunch awesome video of bill congrats
354988,Moosebunk,2009-06-24 01:43:00,3970,"Just a quick check-in here... back to house hunting tomorrow.  My sunday fish on St. Anthony and monday on Williston went OK... caught some smaller pike and had a big big blowup and miss on a black buzzbait.  Definitely put some miles on.  Enjoyed Larder area quite a bit.  Beautiful up there, busy too.  But that's what makes Solopaddler adventures so special, as, you're always willing to step away from the crowds at a moments notice.  Getting into the back lake was well worth the adventure and maybe even the few knocks on the Hondas.  You and Bill sure are both hard on your hands when you fish too. lol.  Thanks for the invite again Mike.  Was a pleasure meeting you, Bill and Frank.  Hope to do it again sometime."
355032,wallacio,2009-06-24 02:58:00,475,A great trip (and report).   Can't wait for the end of July guys...hopefully by the end of that trip we'll be sick of Walleye!!!
355039,BillM,2009-06-24 03:12:00,17367,"Dave, I've got the jigging down for the eyes.  I consider myself a walleye machine now.  "
355064,solopaddler,2009-06-24 07:05:00,8605, You're very welcome and the feeling is mutual. Good luck with the house hunt bud.    Can't wait either bud!    Dude you slay me.
