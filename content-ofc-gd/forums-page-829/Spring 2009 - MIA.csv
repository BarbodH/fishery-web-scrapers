355286,tinbanger,2009-06-24 19:56:00,1028,Finaly got out today for few hours in Cooks bay . Nothing more than a couple of pesky perch hits to show for it .  This spring was a complete bust as far as fishing goes .managed two trips( Gbay and Simcoe Pike openers) with no fish for me !  Rest of the time taken up with work and putting a new roof on the house.My Wifes health was not the best ( better now) which also kept me close home.  Todays fun started when I tried the free launch at the end of hwy 89 ..bad idea .. barely got out . Followed by a one hour wait for Cooks Marina to open and unlock thier launch.Finished up with one of my LED tail lights not working on the trailer.  flat water and hot sun gave up before noon.  here hoping Bass opener is better.

But I've seen guys backing empy trailers in to pick up their boats, and they get stuck on the way into the water (even in 4 wheel drive).  They couldn't even get the trailer in far enought to pull the boat out.  You really have to watch it their.  It's super soft this year for some reason.  Wasn't like that last fall when I started using the launch.  I've been skunked every time out for pike this year on Simcoe.  Can't figure em out."
