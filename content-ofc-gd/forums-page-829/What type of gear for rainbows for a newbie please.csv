Is it true that I have to use a very light line for trout?  I was thinking of just bringing my 6' canadian methods and then spooling my extra spool with whatever type of line you guys suggest.  Mepps inline spinners a good choice?"
353954,charlied,2009-06-20 19:20:00,584,6 pound p-line flouroclear is a good line to use.  Shiny spinners are good.  small cleos should also work.  Also don't under estimate how productive a live minnow can be.
