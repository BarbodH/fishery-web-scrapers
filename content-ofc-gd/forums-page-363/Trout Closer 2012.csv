733852,kickingfrog,2012-10-01 21:11:00,8333,Those really are some beautiful photos.
733855,Jds63,2012-10-01 21:14:00,1365,Stunning shots !
733868,atvaholic,2012-10-01 22:23:00,271,"Wow, i'd also love to know how you managed those pics. Really cool."
733895,EC1,2012-10-01 23:24:00,930,Nice! So what's on the menu now? Joining all the salmon guys?
733898,MJL,2012-10-01 23:32:00,2427,"Thanks guys. Glad you enjoyed the pics   Thanks John. It's a baby Atlantic salmon   In bright light, gin clear water, my camera does a pretty good job figuring out aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc, automatically in Program-mode.  In anything but bright sun and gin clear water (which is more often than not), I normally have to adjust the speed, aperture and ISO manually just so that I can get decent shots from one spot to the next  Camera is set to burst shooting and with my Canon 40D, I can shoot at 6.5fps which equates to a lot of pictures  . The auto focus system is pretty good on the camera and lens. All in all, its pretty much an exercise in getting lucky and hoping you get that 1 shot that turns out OK. I've got a hard drive full of pictures that didn't really turn out as well as I hoped. I'm blessed that the rivers I've been fishing have been full of co-operative fish  As far as getting shots of the fish, often times I'm fighting the fish with one hand, bracing the camera with one foot and pressing the shutter with the other hand. Other times, I'm sitting in the river for an hour or two waiting for the fish to get close to the lens. I've done underwater timelapse with the autofocus still engaged (not the most effective but probably the easiest) - You just leave the camera in the water for a few hours and come back to a few thousand pics.LOL   Eagerly waiting for the new stick to be completed  It looks like the guides I picked up were pre-ground and then anodized over? Makes my job a lot easier   I was only able to use the flash system for the 1st picture. All the other pics I did not use flash. With underwater photography, gin clear water and good natural light makes shooting easy"
733977,mirogak,2012-10-02 12:58:00,387,I was looking forward to your river fishing snaps - thx for sharing Mike.
733982,SirCranksalot,2012-10-02 13:13:00,3291,Wow! Fantastic pix. I bet they were worth the dunking!!
733983,SylvanOwner,2012-10-02 13:22:00,266,Very cool pictures.  Just wondering if the line is flouro or mono?  Not looking to open a can of worms here just curious.
734002,TroutStlkr,2012-10-02 15:34:00,2,"Best underwater brook trout pictures I've seen anywhere?  BTW, how can you tell the difference between a Brown and an Atlantic at that size?"
734006,BillM,2012-10-02 15:45:00,17367," The giant eye on the Atlantic is a dead giveaway, as is the long snout."
734066,MJL,2012-10-02 22:01:00,2427,"Thanks again guys   Mono. When I'm fishing gin clear streams for trout, I find line diameter to be more important in ""line invisibility"". IMO, fluorocarbon is just as visible as any clear monofilament of the same diameter. There are some fluorocarbons I do like for my steelhead fishing because they actually do seem more abrasion resistant than the Maxima Ultragreen I normally use for my leaders.   Aside from the massive eyes as Bill eluded to, the mouth does not extend past the eye like it would on a brownie."
734125,northernpike56,2012-10-03 03:22:00,717,"nice fish. I caught 1 brook trout and 2 brown trout on my closer, they sure are pretty fish."
734171,TroutStlkr,2012-10-03 14:46:00,2,"  Thanks, I can see that now."
734206,ehg,2012-10-03 16:45:00,2666,Well done on the photos! Almost similar to angling but somehow even better.  Always liked hitting Lake O trib headwaters for trout closer.
734224,ricoboxing,2012-10-03 17:45:00,398,awesome pics dude!
733694,MJL,2012-10-01 02:35:00,2427,"It’s the last day of September which marks the end of trout season for many stretches of river. If there is one thing I’ll miss, it’s stalking the river banks for colourful brookies. The last few days I was able to spend a couple hours in the morning stalking small streams for these pretty little jewels. The streams are cold, the bugs are gone, the leaves are turning orange, most other river anglers are salmon fishing elsewhere, what’s not to like?  1 brookie at the crack of dawn. I got to test out my remote flash system which involved climbing a tree at 5:30am to strap my 2 camera flashes and then falling into the river. I was soaked but at least I got 1 picture out of it       Hide & seek     It really is an Atlantic salmon this time   Had to sort through a lot of these...I was surprised when I caught a few on muddler minnows swung down & across.     Male brookie in spawning colours   The red dots on the brookies from one stream were almost glowing underwater.         Bye for now brookies, hello steelhead!  Cheers  Mike"

733821,Lunkerhunter,2012-10-01 18:41:00,455,wow those underwater shots are by far the nicest i have seen. was that as a result of your lighting thing you mentioned? or just the camera and clear water?
733825,NAW,2012-10-01 19:05:00,4022,You sure are getting dialed in on the underwater camera!  Great shots
733836,misfish,2012-10-01 20:12:00,29133,Super pics Mike.
733843,Guidofisherman,2012-10-01 20:33:00,206,"Very impressive, clear underwater shots. Would you mind sharing your camera settings and technique used to get such great shots. I get the ""falling out of the tree"" part."
