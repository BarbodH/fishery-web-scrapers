733932,iFish4real,2012-10-02 01:08:00,386,is it any good in the winter??? Thanks!
733939,solopaddler,2012-10-02 01:28:00,8605,Not in my experience. I found it to be a barren wasteland.  It was a very very tough nut to crack.  Only positive is the scenery.

733944,iFish4real,2012-10-02 01:39:00,386,Thanks guys! Gotta find a better place I guess...
733945,Muskieman,2012-10-02 01:47:00,2472, Yep
733953,Nipfisher,2012-10-02 02:49:00,2449,Rented a day hut from Ravenscroft Lodge about 10 years ago. Hut sucked and not one bite all day targeting lakers.
733954,GBW,2012-10-02 02:52:00,8460,Same and same.  We stayed at Ravenscroft Lodge (I think; 99% sure) and the dinners were good but that's all I can say good about the whole area.  9 guys with the white stripes on the backs after 3 days isn't a good time if you ask me.
733957,irishfield,2012-10-02 03:01:00,26272,Drive 15 minutes further North!
733961,Musky or Specks,2012-10-02 04:24:00,2710,My experience as well spent three days for bupkiss . Took Irishfields advice and started going 15 minutes further north and have never looked back.
733964,solopaddler,2012-10-02 09:29:00,8605,  I just noticed the 2nd part of your signature. HAHA! Nice.
733975,GBW,2012-10-02 12:56:00,8460,It was too funny not to post it.
