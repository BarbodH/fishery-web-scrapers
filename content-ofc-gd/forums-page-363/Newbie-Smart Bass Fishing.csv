Since I was a kid I have always known about a spot about an hour away from Hamilton with huge large mouths but never fished there as we camped at Little Lake (close to Norwich) and caught bass there.  Since bass season opened I have been fishing at this spot frequently and I have never ever seen anyone there fishing besides young kids.  My days have been spent catching not much more then 2lb bass and once I caught one there wasn't a bite for hours after. I think 3 were the most I ever caught in one day.  The water is just large enough for a canoe but it would be awkward being seen in one because if you have a good reel you can cover most of the water where one would expect the bass to be at. Although, there are huge orange sunfish right smack in the middle that are worthwhile making the trip out for just to see the size of these guys.  Anyways, three weeks ago I caught one of the monster bass on a Rapela. It weighed in at 8 pounds 4 ounces.  Like I said I am pretty much the only one that fishes there and since I caught one of the monsters they let me know they know I am there by swimming right up to where we can see each other, and not a bite since. I think people who used to fish there gave up since they are so timid, smart or whatever else you call that.  I have been throwing spinners, Rapelas, plastic and the odd frog at them and not a bite since. The water is crystal clear, very deep and no weeds near the surface to speak of.  On my first post I hate to ask a what would you do question but I am asking what would you do?  Just a side note: I was alone when I caught the 8 pounder so no pics.....sorry.  ..........and sorry for the long read,"
733384,gino,2012-09-29 02:58:00,400,"welcome to the forum, man...if the water is so clear as you said they might get spook very easy, you have to try a more stealth approach to that body of water. Don't worry , you'll get them somehow but sometimes whatever you throw at them, they won't bite... next time u go make sure you have ur camera with you...members on this forum ""love"" pictures  cheers!  Gino"
733385,HyperActive,2012-09-29 03:08:00,56," Thanks for the fast reply and the advise Guide,  I know I am the only in the world one without a cell phone but my birthday was last Friday and I received an Ipod as a gift, not much more then 2 weeks after catching a 8 pounder. The Ipod has been with me ever since. I am going out again tomorrow and I have my fingers crossed."

733413,Christopheraaron,2012-09-29 13:42:00,3525,Welcome to the forums! We love long reads
733424,Jigger,2012-09-29 14:30:00,1237,"Focus on low light periods and like gino said, be stealthy. Keep low to the ground, dont stomp in, cast from behind bushes or whatever it takes to conceal your presence. If you know where they are, itll happen eventually!"

733539,HyperActive,2012-09-30 07:13:00,56,"Today I went out for 10.5 hours and I caught one bass (maybe a pound and a half). The body of water is a quarry and since the water is low you can walk to ""hot"" spots now you could never fish earlier in the season.  The place that should be one of the best spots begins with loose rocks that are shaped like tennis balls and you may have a  1' wide path of the loose rock that slopes towards the water to walk on between bushes with thorns digging in your arm while you are not trying to fall in the water with your pole in hand.  It pretty much goes from zero depth to 3' to 30' very quickly, and there is a stretch where you have to hold tree branches and walk in the 3' water making sure you don't slide into the 30' of water as your walking on loose rocks in the water on that steep slope (surprisingly enough the water was still a nice temperature to walk waste deep.)  Sure enough when I finally make it there I cast 3/4 times and right on que a huge bass comes by faces me and slowly swims away.  There is no place to hide as your toes are in the water and your heal can not go back any further and your still standing on loose rocks that drastically slopes towards the water. It is brutal to stand like that for any length of time, but knowing what is in there keeps me going back for as long as I can.   I think I am seriously going to make things a bit easier for myself and invest in one of those frog boats I seen on The Fishing Network. I absolutely love the quarry and I know how big the fish are there and maybe the boat will make things even better.  In the meantime I will try your suggestions as much as I can.  Thank you all,"
