733859,irishfield,2012-10-01 21:36:00,26272,"I thought the same thing early this summer with Lakers full of eggs (since they spawn in late October)... but I guess considering wimmin have eggs all year long and just wait to ""spawn""... maybe it's similar in fish!"
733860,Christopheraaron,2012-10-01 21:42:00,3525,"Think about steelhead, they mostly spawn in the spring but start migrating come fall."
733888,EC1,2012-10-01 23:14:00,930,"I've seen that in some fall crappies before. My best guess is that they're already stocking up for next spring! From what I recall, they're not huge egg sacs, and don't look anywhere close to being ripe yet."
733899,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-01 23:34:00,2582,"Spent last Wednesday perching on Simcoe, kept 18 for a good fish fry with the family. Everyone of them was a female and they all had there spring eggs starting. I do alot of perching and can assure you that this is the norm for this time of year in the waters I fish anyway."
733928,Muskieman,2012-10-02 00:58:00,2472,Walleye too .. I think it may have to do with the water temps ... ( false spawn) type of thing ? ...
733930,mike rousseau,2012-10-02 01:02:00,4661,Eggs have to grow... That takes time... Walleye have had small eggs for a while now...
733979,SylvanOwner,2012-10-02 13:02:00,266,"I think Mike has this right and I've seen it many times myself on spring spawning fish.  Pretty sure they have to start investing resources many months in advance to develop eggs, especially for spring spawners where the ""many months"" covers the winter, i.e. slower metabolism and reduced intake of food.  Some bass that I've eaten have eggs in September...for a May spawn, you do the math.  Interesting to hear Irish relate his experience with lakers which are the exact opposite....egss in spring for a fall spawn.  However we all know lakers are coldwater species with relatively low metabolism so I think it all makes sense ultimately.  One other noteworthy fact similar to this is that while electrofishing along the Toronto waterfront with an MNR bio on board it was stated that some fish, in this case Brown Trout, actually will reabsorb their eggs if environmental conditions(or other?) aren't met and the spawning attempt is abandoned."
