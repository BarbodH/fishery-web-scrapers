Weather was great, river was perfect. Anyone that has never tried fishing the river should give it a try. I had 2 newbies with me that had never fished the river before, now they have a different thought about the river, wanting to do it again. Special thanks to all that helped out. OH and the burgers and dogs were great. First place went to Dave Steeves with a 2.11 Lb. Walleye. Second Place went to Craig Marsh with a 2.07 Lb. Walleye. Third Place went to Dan Farrar with a 1.11 Lb. Walleye. Dave left accepting his prize from derby organizer Glenn Moncrieffe  Left to right, Dave, Craig, Dan.  This was Dave's fishing partners AL & Harvey left&right  Nothing like blowing your own horn, but winning doesn't come that often."
733594,Roy,2012-09-30 17:17:00,13728,Good stuff Dave. Thanks for sharing!
733607,Leecher,2012-09-30 18:37:00,7832,That's awesome Dave    Congrats on the win   I'm assuming here you kept the walleye    Ummmmm fish fry    I foresee a hot pan in your future with patatoes and sauteed vegetables Congrats again
733664,Fish Farmer,2012-10-01 00:41:00,2234,"Thanks Roy. Being Glenn's first year running a derby he did alright, but he's going to make a few changes. One thing he made some money for the kids derby next year  Thanks Jacque, that river is just a catch and release fishery for me. The water there Jacque is not like water in your area, the river water is pretty dirty. But I know a few people that do eat the fish from the Grand River."

733757,Live2fish85,2012-10-01 14:22:00,1633, I made that mistake this year. I got one right after opener above the dunnville dam. I figured what the heck and tried it. Man was it gross haha. It tasted nothing like a Lake Erie walleye or northern walleye.  I won't take another thats forsure haha.
