It was maybe 20 ft from the shore, at first I thought a carp got spooked but dont think that was the case, I couldn't positively ID what the fish was but it was quite large 10-15 lbs maybe more. It covered about 10 meters in couple seconds just below the surface changing direction at one point, which makes me think it was chasing something. I thouht maybe it was a pike (colour seemed right) but it was pretty fat and I would've expected it to be longer at that girth. What else could it be?"
