733973,Court R,2012-10-02 12:52:00,213,Was wondering if there is a spray I could use on the bottom of my 14' tinner to seal the leaky rivets? was thinking maybe that spray in bed liner? any thoughts?    Thanks
733976,GBW,2012-10-02 12:57:00,8460,use caution as it might add a lot of weight to the boat
733978,cheaptackle,2012-10-02 12:58:00,849,Have you tried peening them yet?  Michael
733980,d_paluch,2012-10-02 13:03:00,343,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2R_VN_vH_g  I mean, if it works on a tinnie with a screen door floor....  in all seriousness though, my neighbour bought this stuff to coat some spots on his tinnie that had minor leaks, and while it slowed them down, flex seal did NOT fix the issue.  Good luck in your search!"
733981,NAW,2012-10-02 13:06:00,4022,"If the rivets are accesible on both side, try tightening them first.  If they can not be tightened any more, then drill and replace them.  If you don't want to go thru the hastle, then find out which rivets are leaking as use something like 3M 5200, or Gluvit, and dab that on the leaking rivets."
733986,jedimaster,2012-10-02 14:10:00,3472,Or sell it and buy a lund... sorry dude I had to say it. I have never seen anything that will fix leaky rivets short of replacing them or tightening them(a 2 man job)
733989,greyhawk,2012-10-02 14:33:00,33,"Find leaking rivets, as N.A.W. advises, and dab on a product called SICOFLEX, found at many marinas. Sicoflex,apparently, is used extensively on the west coast for many problematic leaks. An excellent product which I have used with great success."

734216,irishfield,2012-10-03 17:24:00,26272,"  Knew someone had to capitilize on it sooner or later! Although they should learn how to debur a hole before doing a video.  Cost of their product..  If you want it fixed correctly my shop rate is only $60/hr, sealer is $10 for an entire tube and rivets are about 50 cents each for blinds and less for solids. Mark the leakers and bring me your boat."

734234,Court R,2012-10-03 18:36:00,213,"Thanks for the replies, I can replace them too but was wondering if there was a easiler way with a spray coating or such as its just a cottage boat."
734239,capt bruce,2012-10-03 18:49:00,820," Dude you know how many people have found themselves in a very scarey situation BECAUSE ITS JUST A COTTAGE BOAT . Anytime you are out away from shore you need to trust your vessel . Just a word from someone who knows , dont cheap out on your boat ,fix what needs to be and do it right, you could have kids , grand kids , wifes , etc. on board tell them , ""it was to much at the time "" , like I said someone who knows .."

734279,Billy Bob,2012-10-03 21:57:00,5865,Don't need to make a federal case out of this........identify the leaky rivets and clean the area......using 3M Chalking for less then $10 and use the rest of the money you might waste taking it to someone for expensive outboard gasoline.....
734280,F7Firecat,2012-10-03 22:06:00,347,I got some liquid rubber around if your interested in it
