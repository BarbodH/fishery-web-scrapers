733673,zamboniwaterboy,2012-10-01 01:29:00,126,Hello A friend was complaining about the price of the 25w40 motor Mercury requires in their motors.  He has a 3.oL four cylinder I/O.  Is it necessary to run this oil or can he get away with a much cheaper 10w30? Thanks

That said.. if he wants a gallon cheap, I have one here.. 25w40 synthetic blend... that I no longer use in my Verado now that it's using a special mix 25W50. Lists at about $48 a gallon.. if he's in the area (Penetang) he can have the one I have for $25 cash."

733730,bigbuck,2012-10-01 12:18:00,2449,"Running 10w30 in an i/o is asking for trouble. Reason being, an i/o engine which is a slightly modified car engine runs hard constantly. Picture driving your car up a neverending hill. That's what boat engines have to endure. I run straight 30 weight oil in my 4.3. If he's that thrifty, run 15w40 that goes on special at West Marine. Just make sure the oil gets changed at least once yearly if not more depending on use. Trashing an engine to save a few bucks on oil is kinda dumb. There's hundreds of these kind of threads on iboats.com. Everyone has an opinion."
