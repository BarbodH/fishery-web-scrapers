733923,Stoty,2012-10-02 00:36:00,2910,Thanks guys!
733925,Handlebarz,2012-10-02 00:45:00,3790,Awesome ski one of these days I will hook into the lsc tigers
733929,Fish Farmer,2012-10-02 01:00:00,2234,"They are a nice looking fish,congrats, almost looks like L.Erie background, thats were I got my Tiger, fishing for Perch."
733965,lew,2012-10-02 10:57:00,12766,"Pretty little fish you got there Stoty.  Never caught one myself, or even seen one for that matter, but it'd be nice to get one just to have the picture."
733987,fishnsled,2012-10-02 14:17:00,3520," Same here Lew. I've got a buddy that has caught 6 or 7 of them from different lakes that I fish as well but haven't had the pleasure of seeing one up close.  Nice fish Stoty, love the markings on them."
733991,Stoty,2012-10-02 14:54:00,2910,Thanks guys!
734042,mercman,2012-10-02 19:40:00,7054, Someone piss in your cornflakes this morning???
734044,Spiel,2012-10-02 19:49:00,9065, I guess I may be the only other person who gets it.
734046,mercman,2012-10-02 19:58:00,7054,  have to start meditateing again:angel:
734047,capt bruce,2012-10-02 20:11:00,820,"  No not the only one , but it is what it is , cant be changed ."
734053,Stoty,2012-10-02 20:41:00,2910,Sent him a PM asking what his deal was.... no response.

734075,Dutch,2012-10-02 22:53:00,831," If this was a thread that ASKED for recomendations for good dropshotting lures and Stoty piped up and said x-zone are amazing, he would have had a significant number of people agree with him.  He volunteers that same information in this thread and a few jump down his neck.  The guy is sponsored and he is using the Board to promote that, albeit overtly is some cases.  Sponsorship deals are tough and the guys fortunate enough to get them need to promote the product as often and overtly as possible in the short season that we have here in Ontario.  Unless there is some Board policy on promotion of a sponsor, each person on here is just providing their own opinion including me, and you know what they say about opinions.....  This comment coming from an admin leads me to think a policy could/may be coming - which would be a real shame."
734076,Stoty,2012-10-02 23:02:00,2910," Totally agree! If I dont tell what I got it on... I'm ""one of those guys"" I tell what I got it on...I'm a ""spammer""  Guess you can't please everyone!"
734077,Grimace,2012-10-02 23:09:00,2020," Not at all.  This is not a place of business.  People who overtly and repeatedly use this site for shameless self promotion are taking advantage.  People should feel free to mention what types of lures and techniques they are using, that being said, it is pretty obvious when someone is being a shill.  Anyways, that is a beauty little tiger.  They sure are a handsome fish.  This message was typed by a Toshiba Satellite A660. I would also like to take a moment and thank Microsoft Corporation for providing me with a delightful little mouse, Sylvania for the homey glow in my den, and finally Glidden paints for providing a beautiful and bright workspace that keeps me in a positive and productive state of mind."
734078,Jigger,2012-10-02 23:11:00,1237,"Nice kitty. Sure, Brookies are beautiful fish. But, because of the rarity factor, that right there is the prettiest fish swimming IMO.  Why youd go out to chase big smallies with a ML outfit and 6lb test would be my main query to this thread. Bass are still full of vinegar right now. Had a good one break off the fluoro leader this past wknd. The leader was 10lb and fresh. 6lb just sounds like youre asking for heartbreak."
734082,bassman87,2012-10-02 23:26:00,586, lol awesome
734095,Stoty,2012-10-02 23:47:00,2910," ML with 6 lb test is a fairly standard dropshot setup. As long as you have a good reel with a nice smooth drag system, it does the trick quite nicely. I havent had an issue with losing many fish due to snap offs. Just happened that it was hooked in a decent spot. I thought for sure it was gonna break off, especially as the fish got closer to the boat and made some runs and even jumped a few times. Got lucky to land it, for sure."
734101,mercman,2012-10-03 00:05:00,7054,"I dont know.Maybe i'm just bloody stupid or something. I don't see any blatant advertiseing in this thread.I have had incredible success with  XZONE SLAMMERS  in the month since a non sponsored angler friend of mine introduced me to them. They have produced great results for any species i have used them on. I plan on using them extensively this fall both drop shotting smallies and jigging for walleye. Im my opinion, they and swammers are the best baits to hit the market since plastic baits were invented. Anyone who doesnt try them, just because an angler living his dream posted the name in bold type on a FISHING forum, is.....well you fill in the blanks.  Sometimes i just cant believe what i read here."
734104,Roy,2012-10-03 00:15:00,13728,It appears that I have a little bit of work to do here.  Not to worry.  My apologies to Stoty for locking his thread.
733861,Stoty,2012-10-01 22:10:00,2910,"Was out yesterday and was targeting SM using 6lb test and dropshotting an Xzone Slammer when I feel a pretty good ""thump"" and some dead weight... I set the hook, and drag starts peeling! I was REALLY hoping it was a TANK smallie, but up came this GORGEOUS thing!  It was my first ever Tiger Musky, and it put up quite the fight on a ML rod with 6lb test! I couldn't get over the colouring on this fish! Stunning!  "
733862,davey buoy,2012-10-01 22:13:00,5505,"That's a beauty, 6lb line,amazing."
733864,Christopheraaron,2012-10-01 22:14:00,3525,Those slammers sure are a great bait! Measurement on that beaute?
733865,Rich Clemens,2012-10-01 22:17:00,3131,Very nice.   Thanks for posting the pic.
733866,Dutch,2012-10-01 22:17:00,831,Nice colours.  What lake - Balsam?
733867,Stoty,2012-10-01 22:17:00,2910,"Was only a 28""er.... but it's quality and not quantity............. right?!?"
733869,bdox,2012-10-01 22:27:00,329,"Nice fish, but why do you continuously spam this board. Was it nessecary to bold the name of the brand you're sponsored by?  http://w.xzonelures.com/?page_id=294  I'm surprised you didn't link it right to your store."
733871,Stoty,2012-10-01 22:29:00,2910,Sorry... that's not my store!
733872,Andrew Grant,2012-10-01 22:32:00,201,"Beautiful fish, I hope to catch one some day.  I haven't heard of many caught on GBay though,  and I have never seen one.  There are pike and musky so there must be tigers!"
733873,Christopheraaron,2012-10-01 22:32:00,3525, Who cares? I rather know what he's using.
733875,Stoty,2012-10-01 22:33:00,2910, 
733879,Slop,2012-10-01 22:46:00,151, Thats one handsome fish.
733880,Stoty,2012-10-01 22:50:00,2910," Thanks! This is the first time that I've ever seen one in person. I couldnt get over the colours/patterns on it! Beautiful fish! Quite smelly though! LOL  Ya, there would def be some in GBay, I would think."
733881,davey buoy,2012-10-01 22:51:00,5505," Tards!,havn't heard that in a while.lol."
733882,Stoty,2012-10-01 22:51:00,2910," Thanks Slop! And yes... I've def dealt with some ""winners""."
733884,MJL,2012-10-01 22:59:00,2427,Beautiful fish! Congrats. I really love the markings on the tiger muskies.
733885,ttahhan,2012-10-01 22:59:00,191," Im really surprised at your comment, simply not necessary...."
733887,ttahhan,2012-10-01 23:08:00,191,"Hey Nice Fish, those colors up close, must of looked phenomenal...... Congratulations on catching a Tiger on light line, you must have felt every shake and man, those lucky craft lures sure do the trick ..."
733889,BillM,2012-10-01 23:14:00,17367,Is that a piece of gill hanging out from the plate?   Can't beat the look of those fish.
733903,Stoty,2012-10-01 23:41:00,2910, Good eye Bill... yes the one gill was chewed up a little bit. Looked like it got hit by something BIG.
733904,BillM,2012-10-01 23:42:00,17367," I didn't see any blood, so I assumed it was there before you caught it.  I've seen a few pike with that exact issue, they didn't seem to be bothered by it, lol.  Great looking fish man!"
733905,Stoty,2012-10-01 23:43:00,2910," Ya, it was. Judging by the fight...it didn't seem to bother it!  Thanks Bill!"
733906,Stoty,2012-10-01 23:44:00,2910, I sure did! ML rod and 6lb test...made for a great fight! lol
733907,mistaredone,2012-10-01 23:45:00,913,"I always like to read the when, where and how. Nice Tiger!"
733918,Rizzo,2012-10-02 00:25:00,4754,"beauty fish. As far as the gills, there is a quarry out here and I repeatedly catch the same pike...and he's got more gill hanging out than that! I'm amazed good ol one lung keeps coming back for more"
