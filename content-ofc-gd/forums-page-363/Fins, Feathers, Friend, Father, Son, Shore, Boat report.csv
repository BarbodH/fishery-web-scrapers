FIRST EVENING JACK AND ME WENT SHORE FISHING UP THE ROAD WHILE MUM WAS DOING NIGHT SHIFT                        WE GOT 2 SMALLER ONES AND HAD A NICE SUPPER TOGETHER, HE IS A GREAT HELPER AND LOVES GUTTING THE FISH.              NEXT EVENING MUM WAS WORKING AGAIN SO WE TRIED FROM SHORE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE                      DID NOT CATCH A THING.....BUT IT WAS GREAT FUN ANYWAY. WE WATCHED THE SUN GO DOWN TOGETHER AND ROASTED SOME MARSHMALLOWS TO EASE THE SKUNKY FEELING                     A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER MY BUDDY AND ME HEADED OUT FOR WALLEYE, PICKED OFF A FEW BIRDS ON THE WAY IN.             WAS A BEAUTIFUL FALL DAY, COMPLETE WITH BLUSTERY WINDS AND SHOWERS, BUT MAINLY SUNNY.                 THE FISH WERE DEFINITELY HUNGRY......BUT SMALL               BUT WE GOT SOME NICE KEEPER SIZE AND A COUPLE OF 25""ERS+             NEXT AFTERNOON WHILE MUM AND JACK NAPPED I SNUCK OUT LOCALLY TO SEE IF THE TROUT WERE PLAYING......THEY WERE.           ALSO MANAGED 2 30""ER WALLEYE                     WATCHED ANOTHER AWESOME SUNSET AS I STRAPPED THE BOAT TO THE TRAILER ON THE WAY OUT.            SOME VIDEO OF THE ADVENTURES  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/YrDIszNcvgo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>          <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/JW8IGoGUAo4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>      Fish all came from 30' - 48' FOW on both days out in the boat on 2 different lakes.   Jigs and minnows (mostly 4 - 6"" suckers/dace minnows) were the bait and tackle, straight jigging the presentation, good use of electronics helped locate them.   1st day was blustery wind and rain, next day was mostly sunny....wind was average 10kmh both days. Water temps were mid 50s at the surface.     tight lines all!"
