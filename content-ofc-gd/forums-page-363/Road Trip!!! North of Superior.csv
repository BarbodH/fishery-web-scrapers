733624,kickingfrog,2012-09-30 21:43:00,8333,Thanks for the information guys. Where we eat and sleep will depend on the fishing and the weather so it's good to have a few back-ups.   How does someone wake up dead?  We will not be staying in T.Bay.
733653,danc,2012-10-01 00:12:00,4677," Sorry that you didn't take my light hearted joke so seriously, but you're welcome for my other advice.  Any time you need info on traveling up here, just ask Mr. Frog. I've spent the past 30+ years traveling between Wawa and Kenora, and all points north of there."
732257,kickingfrog,2012-09-24 22:58:00,8333,Heading to northwestern Ontario next weekend and looking for some recommendations for places to eat on the way and spend the night.  Sudbury - Sault Ste. Marie - Thunder Bay  Likely overnighting in the Thunder Bay area.   Thanks for the input.
732270,Joeytier,2012-09-24 23:18:00,3990,Stay in Wawa.
732276,solopaddler,2012-09-24 23:27:00,8605,"No real advice from me Rob, but glad to see you're going.  Will you be fishing?"
732281,FishAbout,2012-09-24 23:32:00,106,Terrace Bay is a nice little town to stay at with a couple small motels.
732292,TennesseeGuy,2012-09-24 23:45:00,957," Where will you end up?  I'll be at a fly in.  You could journey up a couple of dirt/gravel logging roads, safely park your car and take about a 2 mile hike along a river and I could make it down some rapids and pick you up for a good half day of walleye and pike fishing.   Travel light and use my equipment.  A long shot, but a maybe............  Just sayin'."
732298,Rod Caster,2012-09-24 23:58:00,5784,"if you decide to stay the night between the Sault and TBay, try the continental hotel in White River. The suite rooms are quite nice. The restaurant next door is pretty good too.   Wok With Chow in Marathon is VERY good."
732341,Acountdeleted,2012-09-25 01:13:00,2562,"Stanley burger just outside of Thunder Bay used to be the place to be. Not so much now sadly. Its a shame you arn't going up Long Lac and Hearst way, I could tell you about a bunch of hidden gems."
732342,Muskieman,2012-09-25 01:16:00,2472,You Gotta Eat Here !!! (TV show on FOOD) WE ate there 2 years ago and HOOOOLLLLAYYYY WOW! http://www.tbnewswatch.com/entertainment/179812/The-taste-of-Hoito
732348,bigcreekdad,2012-09-25 01:33:00,546,Skip Thunder Bay....I stayed over there a night last year on way to Fireside Lodge. I will sleep in my car if I have to instead if no other options. Went thru several nice towns. Use Mapquest andTravelocity for some ideas.
732356,TDunn,2012-09-25 01:49:00,680,Voyageur in batchawana  ain't to shabby if you plan on staying the night in the area. Good rooms and food.
732360,solopaddler,2012-09-25 01:54:00,8605, That's an offer I'd have a hard time refusing. Enjoy your trip Connie!    Is the Salzberger Hof still in business in Batchawana Bay? I stayed there a few times years ago steelheading north of the Soo and it was always great.
732365,TDunn,2012-09-25 02:04:00,680, Yes it is. My gf and I stopped in there a few weeks ago to see if we could get a table. We couldn't! Make reservations we wish we did!
732385,kickingfrog,2012-09-25 02:45:00,8333,   Sioux Lookout is the final destination for some of fishing. We'll be wetting a line at a few of the rivers on the north shore on the way.
732387,Moosebunk,2012-09-25 02:48:00,3970,Sounds like a great plan and time away to me Rob.  Good luck man!  Take lotsa pics and do it up good here when ya get back.
732413,Jet,2012-09-25 06:54:00,364,"If you like Poutine, the place in Spanish right on the highway is great. It's a walk-up style joint with finishing line stretched all above the property to deter seagulls. I love Poutine and couldn't believe I found one so good in such a small place. Can't remember the name of the place, but if you go through Spanish and it's open you'll see it."
732432,danbouck,2012-09-25 11:36:00,4380," I'll be in the area next week, I better make reservations"
732440,TennesseeGuy,2012-09-25 12:18:00,957," It was a true long shot, but sometimes they work.  I would have fed you, but with yesterday's cold walleye sandwich rather than taking valuable fishing time to do a shore lunch.  I would have made it down some pretty nice rapids, headed down river and picked you up near the flume dam.  Deep pool below the rapids sometimes holds tons of nice, for the area, walleyes for fall fishing.  I'm talking lots of 19"" to 26"" with one 30"" over many years.  Fished it with a countdown several years ago and quit when I snagged two nice walleyes.  Bumped a lot and didn't realize what was happening.  Finally caught one in the mouth, foul hooked the next two and left.  Huge pike also know where walleyes hang out and that's where I'll find them.  Have a great trip."
732458,torco,2012-09-25 13:28:00,656,I'd say the best food in the Soo is at My Nonna's place  Outside of that enjoy the trip and I am sure you will find some great northern hospitality.
732463,anders,2012-09-25 13:44:00,1168,"Bring some 3/4oz cleos in red, and chuck them off the mouths of the rivers between the Soo and Wawa, you wont be disappointed.  As for eats, the Best Northern just before you get into Wawa is really good."
732490,manitoubass2,2012-09-25 16:14:00,11391,"Edit, sorry, I read that as Sioux Narrows"
732614,Whopper,2012-09-26 00:06:00,2174," Quit it already, don't make me give up my new job already just so you can have a boat partner"
732624,TennesseeGuy,2012-09-26 00:52:00,957,"You're a hot commodity in the labor force.   Could find another, better, job within days.  October, below the Outlet has been good to me in past years.  Made me think I could catch fish, for a few days."
732626,ctdd2006,2012-09-26 00:53:00,531, It's called Lucky's Snack Bar.  Have a great trip!
732653,danc,2012-09-26 02:58:00,4677," Forget Terrace Bay. The pulp mill was recently purchased and the construction crews have all the hotels/motels booked for miles around. In fact, my next job might be there and lodging is looking like a problem for me right now."
732654,danc,2012-09-26 03:00:00,4677, Stayed there and ate there. Agree with both points.
