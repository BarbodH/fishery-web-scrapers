It's great Quinte time to have for then, but with the recent reports from LSC and some solid ones last year too, a fish more rare to the Lund might be a worthy chase.  LSC seems to have different options for how to fish muskie, and good numbers of fish too.  Not fully sure if I'll go and may even look harder at options on the Ottawa or Larry, but again, been thinking about it as an option.  So I guess I'm curious about launch info, reputable and safe places to stay with the boat nearer to the launches, and weather to watch out for making for poor or blown fishing, and a few lure patterns wouldn't hurt either.  Links to local sites for info, reports, PM's, anything welcome.  Thanks.  Bunk."

There is also Deerbrook Marina in St.Joachim, Cove Marina in Lighthouse Cove and Belle River Marina in Lakeshore.  Have a good one!"

733572,Dutch,2012-09-30 15:23:00,831,I'm sure Mike P. would help you out if you sent him a PM.
733621,Bob Devine,2012-09-30 21:14:00,251,With any trip weather will be a factor. With N or E winds LSC get tore up with dirty and rough water. You can even catch muskies from the shore if you get blown off the lake. Also some great walleye and perch action on Erie too.
