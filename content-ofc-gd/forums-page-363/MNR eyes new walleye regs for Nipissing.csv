But a ministry spokeswoman confirmed Friday there are no plans to close the fishery or make any changes to season openings or durations, including the upcoming winter season.  “There are no plans to cancel the ice fishing season,” said Jolanta Kowalski, unable to rule out the possibility regulation changes could be introduced as early as this winter.  The MNR is eying potential changes to the fishing regulations on Lake Nipissing following a recent review of data between 1967 and 2011, which concluded mainly fishing pressure has placed the walleye population in a vulnerable state.  In July, the MNR created the Lake Nipissing Project Walleye Advisory Committee, consisting of local anglers, Nipissing First Nation and other stakeholders, to develop recommendations to help address the problem.  And Kowalski said the MNR has since held a series of four meetings with the committee, which has provided advice on a number of potential management actions for consideration.  “The ministry is currently reviewing all options, some of which include potential regulation changes to the recreational fishery, and will finalize a decision in the near future,” she said.  According to the MNR's data review, Lake Nipissing's walleye population is estimated at half of what it was during its peak in the 1980s, when it was at about 400,000 kilograms.  The review acknowledges there have been other ecosystem changes, such as the colonization of Lake Nipissing by doublecrested cormorants and the spiny water flea. But it indicates that the human harvest target of 66,000 kg, which includes commercial and recreational fishing, is unsustainable based on the current estimated population.  The health of Lake Nipissing's walleye fishery has struggled for more than a decade.  In 1998, research showed high mortality of adult walleye and the potential for a fishery collapse, mainly due to angling pressure. That led to the introduction in 1999 of new management regulations, including a slot size and catch limit of four instead of six – long before such rules were in place for most other lakes.  There were signs of recovery until 2004, when the MNR came out with a report indicating the fishery was again in a stressed condition and required management action. The ministry said a small number of native commercial fishers were responsible for dramatic and unexpected harvest increase the previous year.  As a result, the MNR introduced a winter slot size on the lake in 2005, and Nipissing First Nation adopted its own fisheries management plan, including bylaws regulating harvest quotas and methods. Nipissing First Nation has also since imposed an annual moratorium on gill netting during the spring spawn, sanctioned members caught breaching it and funded fishery research and enforcement.  Again, there were signs of recovery, and the MNR introduced new regulations in 2007, extending the winter walleye fishing season to March 15 from March 7.  The move was opposed by most tourist operators, who argued it was too soon for the ministry to begin allowing more pressure on the fishery. But the ministry said the changes were in response to public demand for more fishing opportunities and that data over the previous two years showed the fishery could handle the added pressure.  The current vulnerable state of the fishery was made public in August when the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) issued a news release, blaming commercial gill netting and calling on the MNR to impose a ban until it can properly regulate and enforce the non-recreational harvest.  The federation, which was asked to join the walleye advisory committee, said it did not participate because the meetings were to focus only on management options for the recreational fishery.

733567,Rod Caster,2012-09-30 15:04:00,5784,Not much indication as to what the change will be.  Down to 2 keepers? Reversed Slot?  I can't wait to get a feed of perch and slay some massive ling this winter.
733579,Scott S,2012-09-30 16:16:00,203,Wow REALLY
733677,Nipfisher,2012-10-01 01:34:00,2449,"  2 keepers and no slot would be fine with me. Heard of lots of perch in the 13"" -15"" range being caught this summer."
733684,kickingfrog,2012-10-01 01:46:00,8333,"Changing the numbers and/or the slot is all well and good, but I know there are people now who do not follow the limit or the slot. If enforcement is not increased to back-up the laws, it is almost pointless."
733734,RangerGuy,2012-10-01 12:51:00,564,Stop the netting and you watch the fishery bound back.. Course that won't happen LOAD OF well you get the idea!  No reason for netting on this lake!
733751,asdve23rveavwa,2012-10-01 13:56:00,2690,"  That is unfortunate Rob!!  Slightly surprising considering Juli and I were checked twice when we were up at Idle Tyme last January.  You'd think people would know better, but, greed is an ugly thing. I think a limit of two is plenty generous, especially considering the amount of decent perch that can be caught. It would truly be a shame to see that fishery collapse completely!!!"
