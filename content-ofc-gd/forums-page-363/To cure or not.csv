My friend told me it was better not to add salt although now I am unsure. I purchased a comercial cure to see if it would help what do you think?"
733488,BillM,2012-09-29 22:16:00,17367,"I don't cure my roe, unless it's loose eggs I'm going to use as candy..  Either vacuum seal it, or freeze it in water."

I didn't cure, just put into days worth of fishing portion ziplocks, made sure they were dry, then sucked all the air out with a straw. it was really gross inhaling all that salmon egg air but it seems to have worked."

733619,batoathome,2012-09-30 20:48:00,47,I prefer to just leave some river water in the zip bag then when I get home air dry them over news paper then use tiny zip bags to pack them ( the ones that look like a drug dealer would use !!lol!!). This way they keep their color and harden up just enough also just have to thaw only what I need not the whole lot.
