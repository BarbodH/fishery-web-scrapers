733758,TennesseeGuy,2012-10-01 14:30:00,957,"Left home last Wednesday morning and 895 miles later spent the night in my van as a guest of Sams Club in the parking lot at Eau Claire, WI.  Made a token purchase at the Walmart, but mainly used their restroom for a squirt and brushing what's left of my teeth.  After a good night in the sleeping bag I hit Walmart again with another token purchase, a long squirt and another brushing.  The checkout lady remembered me from the night before and I admitted the true reason for my visit to her nice store.  Thursday I made it through scenic moose country and ended up at Brett Geary's airway office, by the Chukuni River bridge near Balmertown, Ontario.  Having my own key to his office, I turned the couch into my bed for the night.  Before turning in I had thoughts of hunting down a burger, but saw my odometer sitting on 1498 miles for my ride up and decided not to go over 1500 miles.  No motels for the ride up and no restaurants.  All my food and drink came from my ice chest.  Remember when Dave Cameron was heading for a Florida trip a few years back and he referred to himself as a ""Cheap Canadian.""   Guess I'm the equivilent, from the other side of the border.  By 9 a.m. Friday I'd hitched a ride to Little Vermilion on a 185 that was headed up north to assist in the Native moose hunt.  Lucky, because there's not much flying going on for a few days.  That'll change Saturday when rifle hunters move in.  Several bow hunters were in camp, which meant I got cabin #6, rather than my usual cabin #2 that is closer to the boats.  Bow hunters were successful and the last 3 left yesterday.   The lake is all mine now.   And the camp too, because Brett is ng to heading up north to close down a couple of outpost camps and he'll be tied up at least 2 days.  Fishing conditions are great, but I'm really working hard at catching.   I'm not catching a lot and I'm not marking fish.  Low water level is keeping me from getting to moving water.  My favorite humps, reefs and points are not producing as usual.  I've drifted flats near points, but without the usual success.  I'm finding 14"" walleyes and getting my limit of 15"" - 17"" for a walleye dinner, but it's a challenge.  Same with pike.  I haven't hit them hard, but so far, nothing over around 28"".  I have no complaints.  I'm with really nice people and I'm enjoying life.   So far I'm asleep by 10 or 11 and wake up at 7 or 8 a.m.  My only problem comes when straining my gallon of peanut oil after frying walleyes.  I could use an extra set of hands.   WHOPPER, ARE YOU LISTENING?  Time to head out.  One lake.  One boat.  One fisherman.  October visits to Little Vermilion Lake have made my life better, a lot better."
733760,Roy,2012-10-01 14:40:00,13728,Thanks for the update Connie. Sounds like the place has become your second home over the years. How many more days have you got there to get into a coupla 50 inchers?
733765,TennesseeGuy,2012-10-01 14:59:00,957,"Roy, I flirt with 50"", but wouldn't bet the house that I've ever boated one.  Weather could have me heading home October 6, but a change might encourage me to stay another 6 or 7 or so days.   We'll see how it goes.  With rifle hunters around I'll not want to be fishing shore lines and back of bays, but will need to be finding fish on humps and reefs so I don't spook a man's moose or catch a bullet.  We're expecting a cold snap starting Thursday.  Great for moose hunters.  A little snow will be okay, but I'm less than excited about fishing 2 or 3 days in cold rain."

733784,mepps,2012-10-01 16:17:00,1301,I was just wondering if you were gonna be at LV this fall! I've been trying to convince Jon we should go next spring!
733796,graftongal,2012-10-01 16:48:00,145,"Sounds like you're having a good time as usual Connie! Looking forward to being able to join you again one of these years, lol! And isn't Whopper just good for spaghetti and meatballs?"
733800,kickingfrog,2012-10-01 16:54:00,8333,"My brother and I will be driving by in a few days, I'll wave."
733943,Whopper,2012-10-02 01:37:00,2174,"I hear ya loud and clear I guess you should have stopped here for a care package.   Sandy I'll have you know I've become pretty good of taking care of TG during our spring time trips Seriously I thinks that's why he let's me tag along, that and I'm the only one that can eat as much fish as he can...good stuff now. Missed you guys the last couple trips, hopefully we can do it again"
733988,TennesseeGuy,2012-10-02 14:31:00,957,"Sandy, Clive & Whopper, you know where I'll be next May.   Hope we can all be there.  Figured out how to strain oil without making a mess.  One cup at a time gets it done.  My oil is clean and ready for a few more fish."
734072,Whopper,2012-10-02 22:40:00,2174, Already on the calender
