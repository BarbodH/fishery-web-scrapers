733732,206,2012-10-01 12:29:00,563,Wow that's cool...funny thing i've heard of these things happening and this past weekend i actually had a similar experience. I had a smallie on and the musky took a couple runs at it but never ate it? Gave me and my daughter a thrill to see it happen tho
733839,mike rousseau,2012-10-01 20:19:00,4661,had that happen a bunch of times...  had a musky grab a 25 inch walleye this summer...

733909,ttahhan,2012-10-01 23:47:00,191,Yes...lol this has happened to me as well...reeling up a bass and then the famous V and thump and now your fighting a muskie.....although my muskies have never totally swallowed the bass so only the bass was hooked......and its awesome when they hit up close ...little freaky even.
