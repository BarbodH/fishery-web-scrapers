734228,Christopheraaron,2012-10-03 18:13:00,3525,"Lamprey shot is the best if them all! Once again, great shots!"
734230,ricoboxing,2012-10-03 18:23:00,398, catch fish like no ones watchin
734295,MJL,2012-10-03 22:46:00,2427,I like it Dave  Really digging the lamprey shot! I still haven't figured out a system that doesn't require taking dozens of pictures of failed attempts.  One shot I've always wanted to take is a head on shot (or close to) of a fish jumping directly at the camera. My friends in Alaska got close but they were chased off the river by hungry brown bears.LOL
