You don't have to buy a hybrid/electric vehicle, but there is no need to criticize those whose lifestyle it fits and are willing to be an early adopter and show there is a market for such technology.

733176,danc,2012-09-28 02:53:00,4677,I've never spent more than 13 grand on a vehicle. Who buys this new technology anyways? My tow truck/bush truck is a rusted out 96 Ford F-150 that I've owned since 99. Original exhaust and original front end. And it still drives like brand new. Oh. And it was a rolled over wreck when I bought it. My family car is a 06 Ford 500. Rear brakes and tie rod ends are the only maintenance on it so far. The company trucks that I drive are all Chevs and they are in the shop almost as much as they are on the road. I just don't get it. Am I the only one that has seen the light?

I've been driving these cars for the past 10-12 years (So does my family, we all own diesels).   My last Jetta had over 600,000kms on it when I retired it, it also averaged 50-55MPG US..  My new(er) wagon currently has 330,000kms on it, barely broken in!  Mike and I took my buddies TDI wagon up to Hearst when we flew into the Sutton.  3/4's of a tank one way..  We easily saved $100 on that trip alone in fuel.   It might take you 10 years to recoup 5k if you're driving 20k a year, but I'm doing anywhere from 40-60k per year..  I see around 1100-1300kms per tank (55L's), nothing out there even comes close.  I also agree with Dan, most expensive car I've ever bought was my first Jetta (11k used with 45,000kms on it)..   You'll never see me buying a new car."
733270,Raf,2012-09-28 17:17:00,3495,I don't think I've ever spent more than 5500  my current stable consists of a grand cherokee and a toyota tercel.  the tercel I bought for 1250 and gets me 38mpg on a 100km round trip daily commute.  I can buy a lotta tercels for the cost of a volt or even tdi jetta.  let's see you workout the payback on that one not to mention the cheap cost of (liability only) insurance for an older vehicle vs newer one where you'd want (must if you finance/lease) to have full coverage.  buying new is for suckas.

My sister owns a jetta TDI and my parents have a CRV. They do a trip to Quetico every year and the TDI doesn't cost in fuel nearly what the CRV does.  I on the other hand have a POS van that cost alot in gas and is ready to die lol. With only 260 000km and the trany replaced once at a 100 000km.  GM and Chrysler are garbage. Bunch of over paid usless people. I have friends and family tht work and worked at GM its a joke what they make for there jobs haha.

733688,BillM,2012-10-01 02:01:00,17367," I did the front end once (LCA's with new ball joints, also a new steering rack and tierods), other then that 4 timing belt jobs, a few sets of pads/rotors (more on the rear) and that's about it, hell it still had the original clutch in it when I pulled it off the road and parted it out...  Most reliable car I've ever owned.   My best tank was 1428kms on 55L's..  That's a tad under 60MPG US..  I do all my own work, so I save quite a bit if I do have to do work on my car or truck..   A TB job will run you around $800 at the dealer, I do that same job for $250 in parts and 4-5hrs of my time."

733693,Live2fish85,2012-10-01 02:30:00,1633," Yea I drive a piece of crap Chrysler and I am supporting them constantly. Tranny change at a 100 000 km, u-joint and many other things. My parents in the other hand owned a CRV and they got 498 000 km and didn't do anything but oil and brakes.  I have nothing against the workers for GM, Ford or Chrysler but lets face it, they are mainly union companies whoch means that they do less and when they are pissed at something they don't care if somethings not right.

733702,Live2fish85,2012-10-01 03:17:00,1633, I also have a friend that works for Ford and he will tell you how much of a joke his job is and lots of others there. He gets paid great but his job is nothing hard.  If the case is that my van parts were made in mexico then whats all the crap about supporting Canada and our  companies when they are making stuff in mexico for next to nothing.  I would rather buy a toyota or honda knowing they are going to last longer with less problems.  It will also support  Canadians as they will be in business longer then GM and the others North American made at this rate.

But anyway's........I LOVE it when I see VOLTS and PIRUS's on the road....the more of them the better, as it reduces the overall demand on gasoline which in the LONG run reduces the cost per gallon for my truck..."
733729,Fish4Eyes,2012-10-01 12:17:00,1022," I got one on order. Its about $2500 difference between a manual gas and manual diesel. I would imagine the diesel is a little more preppy than the 2.5L gas as well.  Not sure how valid the claim is but people have gotten 1600ish km on a tank from the new passat tdi. Speaking with the service manager (after my car was a done deal) he said one couple went to PEI and got 1700km on a tank.  I looked long and hard, any other car in its class is either more money or the same amount of money.  The 0% financing craze has people blinded. Look at the actual price of the car, they have inflated it to include 0% financing  ."

732929,Fisherman,2012-09-26 23:39:00,7201," Well lets see how far you get..  With the extended range Volt, you don’t have to choose between electric or gas. You have the option of both. First is the advanced lithium–ion battery that allows you to drive gas-free for an EPA-estimated 38 miles.(about 60km) But Volt doesn’t stop there. Then you switch back to gas. Really..hope that's not their version of cutting edge technology, that wouldn't get me half way to Toronto."
732936,Joeytier,2012-09-26 23:58:00,3990,"I think it's safe to assume that they're not designed for long hauls, but can still do so rather economically."
732939,Snidley,2012-09-27 00:07:00,620,"They are a feature packed car but as a new GM vehicle it would be best to lease it and if it is a good car buy it out, if not give it back to GM. The gas powered electric motor is the best use of an electric technology as it allows for the distances that are common in Canada. I'm not sure they are discounting them here however.  In Ontario your best alternative fuel approach is still propane conversion. Virtually any vehicle you want to drive and fuel at half the price. The province pretty much pays for the conversion in a subsidy and over the long haul propane promotes much longer powertrain life."

Until I have to fill the thing up with 91 octane  I think that maybe these electric hybrid cars are the cars of the future, but if you look at them right now, they cost a lot to run, picture this, you could buy a used bmw/benz/audi for the same price as one of these volt's new, and get a better, cooler car overall, and it would cost the same to run pretty much anyways. If imports arn't your thing, then you could buy one hell of a nice truck used for the same price as one of these.  I just don't see how anyone would want to drive one, considering how much of a pain in the butt they are right now. Maintenance is probably another issue, expensive parts, etc. I know I don't really have any numbers/facts to back any of this up, but I consider myself a car enthusiast, and roughly know how hybrids/electrics stack up against little turbo I4/ I6 cars  EDIT: this is if you don't include this whole 'environmentally friendly' phase we're going through right now.
