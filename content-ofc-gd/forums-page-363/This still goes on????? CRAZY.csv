733475,Jet,2012-09-29 20:49:00,364,That's it!!! Thanks Misfish!
733476,kemper,2012-09-29 20:51:00,2232," No doubt, our side gets it just as bad.  I remember being warned about the rubes on the US side, but to be honest I find them to be much nice than the idiots we have to deal with. Seems like the snaggers on that side don't really realize what they are doing is wrong. Had a few conversations last year with the fly snaggers, they wanted to know why I was ""running such a short lead"".  I saw the lightbulb go on when I explained that running a 12 foot lead in a 5 foot whole was flossing...."
733478,Stoty,2012-09-29 21:32:00,2910,I love the intro..... and music.... LMAO!!!!  Edited to say - that young guy got filled in (in the 2nd video)! LOOOOOOOOL
733481,kemper,2012-09-29 21:53:00,2232, Apologies for the iPhone spelling/grammar errors...
733483,fishinguypat,2012-09-29 22:05:00,547,"That video makes me sick, how can two civilized people come to a brawl over fishing. The fat guy who faught back is as much to blame as the guy who stated it. Shame."
733485,Stoty,2012-09-29 22:07:00,2910," Are you serious????  If some guy got in my face, and grabbed me like that... I'd have done the same thing. Then he continued to splash water and egg the other guy on still.... he's lucky he didnt get filled in even more."
733493,Rod Caster,2012-09-29 22:35:00,5784,"I laughed at the first video....you can see the child ""play snagging"" with a short pole and a piece of line."
733494,BillM,2012-09-29 22:35:00,17367,"Some of you guys need to experience Burt, lol.   Bring your hockey equipment!"
733497,Jigger,2012-09-29 22:51:00,1237,"The first vid had me laughing. The second on had me in fits! The narrator is key there ""And that was a mistake. The other guy looked like he was waiting for it and showed some decent technique..."" all the while guys continue to fish. Classic. The music, again, is key."
733504,Stoty,2012-09-29 23:31:00,2910, 
733600,ch312,2012-09-30 18:01:00,1590," i agree that it's pathetic how some people can get worked up enough about fishing to make thing's physical, but the big guy whacking big mouth a few times was 100% justified. bigmouth was very lucky he only got cracked 3 times, some of us wouldn't have been so nice"
733601,craigdritchie,2012-09-30 18:11:00,1586,"This kind of crap goes on everywhere, not just in New York.  So you have this kind of behaviour going on, dead gutted fish all over the riverbanks, garbage everywhere, plenty of guys riverside taking a leak in plain sight ........ and we wonder why the average person looks at ALL fishermen as a bunch of ignorant barbarians."
733603,woodenboater,2012-09-30 18:18:00,2277,"It's like locals rules on surf waves only this fight was nothing by comparison.  btw, the narrator sounded a helluva lot like Bill Mason, same slow intonation and all"
733605,Steve,2012-09-30 18:32:00,2075,"Craig, you are 100% correct.  i'm often embarrased to tell folks I work with (I'm in mississauga, very close to the credit) that I fish for salmon/trout.  they immediately assume I'm one of the idiots ""fishing"" the local river.  i just advise once the fish leave the lake, I fish for bass."
733609,Snidley,2012-09-30 19:24:00,620,"The little kid emulating daddy's best snaggin' drift in the first video is truly hilarious. Craig is correct, if you hang around Bronte long enough you will see equally outrageous ""fishing"" (don't need a rod boys, I've got a net.) I was fishing the Whirlpool once and there were 3 guys there, me and two locals. I was to the far west of the 'pool they were over on the run where the float fishers hang and when I looked up they were pounding each other over crowding a spot. It was comical until you thought about the rocks, the current and, if injured, just how far up it is to get help. I talked to one of them later and he was totally unfazed about the whole thing. The Niagara region is different that's for sure."
733625,danc,2012-09-30 21:55:00,4677,Wow. One of the best things that I like about fishing is to get away from people. A mile away is too close for me.
733643,chris.brock,2012-09-30 23:48:00,4053,"totally, I'd rather go up north, away from everyone, and even catch nothing, rather than participate in that ugly scene you're lucky to live where you do DanC, the GTA sucks"
733795,Billy Bob,2012-10-01 16:47:00,5865,"You STEELHEAD guys are all nuts.......you're looking for trouble......I only watched the first video and didn't see anything wrong....BTW, I doubt that's from this year....too much water....just had a friend come back from there and he said lots of fish, lots of fishermen but not much water."
733799,Twocoda,2012-10-01 16:51:00,4130,I dont mind walking into a crowd like that ....for 90 percent of the wanna bees ...i like to put on a show for them...fight a few fish and move on...leaving them wondering what they are doing wrong...
733802,Christopheraaron,2012-10-01 16:56:00,3525, AMEN!
733823,davey buoy,2012-10-01 18:53:00,5505, You sound like me!!:rofl2:
733962,castgame,2012-10-02 05:30:00,161,"  great video, great production. the gentility/brutality split reminds me of a great canadian poem:  home-made beer by al purdy I was justly annoyed 10 years ago in Vancouver: making beer in a crock under the kitchen table when this next-door youngster playing with my own kid managed to sit down in it and emerged with one end malted— With excessive moderating I yodelled at him ”Keep your ass out of my beer!” and the little monster fled— Whereupon my wife appeared from the bathroom where she’d been brooding for days over the injustice of being a woman and attacked me with a broom— With commendable savoir faire I broke the broom across my knee (it hurt too) and then she grabbed the breadknife and made for me with fairly obvious intentions— I tore open my shirt and told her calmly with bared breast and a minimum of boredom ”Go ahead! Strike! Go ahead!” Icicles dropped from her fiery eyes as she snarled ”I wouldn’t want to go to jail for killing a thing like you!” I could see at once that she loved me tho it was cleverly concealed— For the next few weeks I had to distribute the meals she prepared among neighbouring dogs because of the rat poison and addressed her as Missus Borgia— That was a long time ago and while at the time I deplored her lack of self-control I find myself sentimental about it now for it can never happen again—  quite a moment captured there"
733294,misfish,2012-09-28 20:25:00,29133,"Was just scooping through some fishing on you tube,and came across this. Reminds me of the old days on the Credit.  No thanks.  <iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/PIXkSxq284o?feature=player_detailpage"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  We see these people trying to hook up??????????????????  THATS FLOSSING AT IT,S BEST."
733296,kemper,2012-09-28 20:32:00,2232,"Plunking. Happens on all the US tribs, much of the time with flyrods..."
733297,davey buoy,2012-09-28 20:34:00,5505,"Great video,kinda makes our areas look remote in comparison. I've never seen that personally. Hope I never do. lol."
733299,misfish,2012-09-28 20:39:00,29133,  Plunking?
733300,manitoubass2,2012-09-28 20:41:00,11391,"What is ""flossing"" or ""plunking""  I've heard these terms used on the board but Can someone be specific??? Is it attempting to foul hook on purpose???  And man thats alot of people on those banks. If it was like that here, I wouldn't even bother. Doesn't look like fishing to me at all"
733302,kickingfrog,2012-09-28 20:44:00,8333,"The ethics can be debated, but it is legal some places."
733303,misfish,2012-09-28 20:56:00,29133," Im not saying it,s not. And to say they are fly fishing"
733304,Christopheraaron,2012-09-28 20:57:00,3525," Basically, never heard of plunking but flossing is getting your hook in the fish's mouth without it actually taking the bait, and snagging is ripping a large hook through holding pools in hopes of sticking one in the side."
733305,Spiel,2012-09-28 20:58:00,9065,"There's many methods used and names for them, for anglers with less intelligence than the fish they seek."
733311,manitoubass2,2012-09-28 21:33:00,11391," hmmm, thanks.  It makes sense to me now what they actually do.   "
733321,kemper,2012-09-28 21:59:00,2232," Flossing, lining, etc - basically means exactly what it sounds like. The line slides through the open mouth of the fish and when you set the hook it seems like a legit hookup. Normally the hook will be on the OUTSIDE of the mouth.  Plunking - not sure where I got that term from, but I doubt that I came up with it myself. I've always used it to refer to exactly what those guys are doing. Heavy weights and big hooks continuously ""plunked"" into a run with a bunch of fish until one ends up with a hook in it. Often those guys don't even have any bait on the hooks."
733334,misfish,2012-09-28 22:23:00,29133," So that tells me,snagging is legal. No issue with that,if it,s legal there.  Not my cup of tea.  Thanks Kemper for your reply."
733366,Richard S.,2012-09-29 00:24:00,75,"Another term used in the states is ""lifting"".  Rich."
733377,Rizzo,2012-09-29 01:49:00,4754,wow. that's a LOT of people fishing together
733390,ttahhan,2012-09-29 03:49:00,191,"SO TRUE the old days on the Credit and Humber did resemble this .....wow i would never fish that, that's insane how do you land the fish.....Tangle....."
733391,Snidley,2012-09-29 03:54:00,620,"It's actually referred to a ""snatching"" It USED to be legal in New York (like many on this board the mainstream Yank angler believed that salmon don't feed/bite in the river) but it is now illegal. It was essentially snagging, usually with a weighted, bare treble hook often referred to as a cricket, or Michigan Cricket. Snatching is still legal for catching Paddlefish, a plankton feeder that won't bite anything lure or bait (or so they say). You can imagine what it looks like, frog water just out of a main channel where the Paddlefish hold, with hillbillies chucking a heavy Muskie sized weighted bare treble seeking soft flesh. The hookup/fight is ridiculous  with a 40-50lb fish hooked high on the back struggling mightily trying to avoid the meat hunting Neanderthal looking for a free feed of the roe. It's legal, like jugging, but it is not pretty.  The chuck and duckers are also an example of what not to do but I don't see much difference between their loutish behavior and what many here would consider doing like...tomorrow morning AND chuck and duckers actually catch very few fish. Like the marshmallow crowd they hook up and you hear ""fish on"" then ""aw fish off"" or ""fish on"" then shortly ""hey buddy get out of my way"" or ""your over my line"",shortly followed by  ""aw fish off"" It's humorous actually, until they cut your tires for taking way too long drifts, and catching way too many fish with your float rod  ."
733393,nkuchmak,2012-09-29 04:24:00,25,"Seen it many times even here in Ontario by so called Fly fisherman.  Had a discussion on the riverside the other day with what seemed to be an educated angler until he began to tell me the only way to catch a salmon was to hope for the fish to swim into the bait. I began trying to explain the possibility of eliciting a predatory response but he refused to believe this was possible because of the old saying ""salmon don't feed in the river"". I think education is key for the ones who believe what they are doing isn't wrong. The ones who don't care well...then its up to our CO's to enforce our laws. I can't wait until these salmon move on up and clear the way for the rainbows."
733431,johnl,2012-09-29 15:19:00,197,i've had salmon attack erie dearies in the river predatory response also got a nice silver one on a jointed rapala at the caledonia dam going for walleye in august so they definitly still bite in the river as i'm sure most of you's know
733436,Snidley,2012-09-29 16:15:00,620,"I met a great fly caster on Bronte who could put a fly in the mouth of a Chinook at will. They were NOT biting the fly but this chap could hook up a specific fish in a bunch with the fly inside of the mouth. He was not flossing. The ethics of it were questionable but it was a completely legal hookup that allowed the fish to fight. He did not really seem that pleased with his outing when finished for the day so I guess he also felt the ethics of it was not great. Sort of the way I feel about roe and essentially the reason I stopped using eggs. Too easy as well as the path to virtually all the hillbilly behavior on the water. As the cops say, it's the cracked window syndrome."
733438,Snidley,2012-09-29 16:23:00,620,By the way what's with the tent in the video. Is that where the judges sit or is it a beer tent? What a zoo.
733454,BillM,2012-09-29 18:19:00,17367,"Way too many guys flossing fish below strike indicators, about as bad as the idiots ripping their floats at the end of each drift."
733470,tb4me,2012-09-29 20:02:00,3295,I'm willing to bet that it becomes a full contact sport there eventually..I myself would end up with the police hauling me away because I was choking some guy...lol No way I would ever fish like that..How do they keep from tangling up their lines?  Edited to satisfy the grammar police...
733472,Moosebunk,2012-09-29 20:45:00,3970,"Been over there to Pulaski about 4 times now but always midweek and later season for the bows.  Yes, it's busy enough, but not as bad as that and I've seen nearly the same on the Ganny.  You can find space if you're willing to walk or driftboat to it.  The plunking approach is a kinda messed up though."
733473,Jet,2012-09-29 20:46:00,364,Sorta like this?
