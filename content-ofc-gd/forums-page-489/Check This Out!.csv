If I recall correctly, the best they've been able to do in lab tests is put a respectable dent in a pencil. Not saying they can't give you a nasty injury, but they aren't deadly. I've removed hooks from their mouths by wedging the mouth open with a thick piece of branch, an inch diameter or more gives you room to work."
621815,The Urban Fisherman,2011-09-15 18:41:00,2050,"Hey Guys!  We shot a great shore show the other day and when we were in the edit suites logging footage we found out that Dave had at least one close call while releasing fish below the dock!!!! Hope you enjoy!   <iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/7GZeJdi2ubk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Cheers, Ryan"

621821,Spiel,2011-09-15 18:49:00,9065,"Yowzzaaaa, that could have been, well, very painfull......"
621825,danbouck,2011-09-15 18:51:00,4380,
621827,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-15 18:52:00,130,hmmmmm numm numms. < notice the turtle eyeing those figners?  almost unlucky for you too. You would might have ended up being Dave's personal line tier for life.
621858,Roy,2011-09-15 20:01:00,13728,Kind of a decent argument for catch and keep eh?
621864,manitoubass2,2011-09-15 20:18:00,11391,"lol, that was pretty neat. Pretty good size snapper too!"
621865,manitoubass2,2011-09-15 20:18:00,11391,"  Yep, or.... We can pressure the MNR to start removing Snapping turtles from all waterways in ON  "
621884,kickingfrog,2011-09-15 21:03:00,8333,Dave would never again be able to count to 10.
621904,Dave Bailey,2011-09-15 22:00:00,1641,"Dang, I was waiting to see you lip him and kiss him."
621983,johnnyb,2011-09-16 01:49:00,3413,"Yowza...that is crazy footage!  I once had my hand right next to a good sized snapping turtle without knowing it....was retrieving a snag...low light in the evening...had that funny feeling about reaching around the downed tree.  Pulled my lure out and there was a monster turtle just sitting there, had been watching it all go down."
621987,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-16 01:58:00,3761,Crazy
621988,Dave Bailey,2011-09-16 02:02:00,1641,"They will go for things dangling from the surface but if your whole body is in the water with them they are absolutely harmless. They invariably try to swim away as fast as they can, in fact I've never been able to get an underwater picture of them because they won't let me get close enough, they can really turn on the jets when they want to."
622051,The Urban Fisherman,2011-09-16 13:13:00,2050,lol glad you guys liked the vid!   I couldn't believe it when I saw it in the edit room... Imagine the hits it would have gotten online if the turtle actually took out one of Dave's fingers!
622105,DT10Sam,2011-09-16 16:34:00,480,"That could have been painful, you can tell Dave didn't know the snapping turtle was there like anyone else he would have needed time to change his pants.  Regards, Sam"
622107,motion,2011-09-16 16:42:00,403,Better count 'dem fingers Dave. That was a close one! Remember what happened to Steve Irwin............you never know!!!!
622109,Harrison,2011-09-16 16:52:00,2202,"Wow, close one.  Is that the same turtle at the end of the vid?  Look at the talons on that thing!"
622111,fishnsled,2011-09-16 17:08:00,3520,That is some crazy footage. It'll make all of us think twice about leaving our hands in the water after we release a fish. Thanks for posting Ryan!
622112,The Urban Fisherman,2011-09-16 17:14:00,2050, haha yeah it's the same turtle as the one at the end...except we didn't know he was there until later in the day..when Dave released that fish none of us knew mr. snapper was hanging out under the dock... and he release a lot of fish that day! lol
622118,Harrison,2011-09-16 18:16:00,2202," I was just looking at those talons!  Never really seen one up close.  They'd probably do some serious damage too.  I am hitting some dock this weekend, I'll have an eye now!"
622136,Familyfisherman,2011-09-16 19:54:00,188,"We caught 2 of them this summer fishing for panfish on docks with the kids...VERY hard to get them freed.  They actually ate the worm/hook...mouth is extremely tough.  The second time the hook came out and went into the front leg...I quickly gave up trying to remove it as the turtle was snapping angrily at me and the pliers, so I was forced to cut the line.  Scared the kids.  Not really as fun as you might think...they're big, heavy, ugly, and while I don't know this first hand I'd say they can take at least a finger..."
622138,Jds63,2011-09-16 20:04:00,1365,"yep thats a great video many years ago about 20, the wife and I were skinny dipping at a buddies cottage after dusk the next morning we went down to the dock with our coffees and we saw the biggest snapping turtle we ever laid our eyes on  Both wife and i nearly had a coronary thinking that was in the water when we were skinny dipping, the wife has never swam after dark since"
622147,ctranter,2011-09-16 20:24:00,543,"Turtles always scared the crap out of me as a kid.  Imaging being 10, swimming at the cottage, and being greeted by a 100lb killer neo-dinosaur with a shell the size of an tractor trailer hub cap.  Add the fact that we are practically the only humans that they ever see, and have very little fear of people and you have one terrified little boy"
622151,Joey,2011-09-16 20:36:00,9122,"Wow, scary yet way cool"
622223,ccmtcanada,2011-09-17 02:38:00,7971," Knowing Dave, he'd wrestle it for his finger back and he'd put in a hook for bait!!"
