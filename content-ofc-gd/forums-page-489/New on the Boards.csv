622179,Default User,2011-09-17 00:40:00,72,"Just a quick intro.  I'm new to the boards, and just wanted to say ""Hi"" and apologize in advance for my Newbieness  In no means am I a pro angler, but love to toss line whenever possible. Used to go weekly when I was a kid - but them I hit puberty, met girls, and, well....that was that.  Years later I got married, had a kid, bought a house....and now I look for every chance possible to go fishing, play golf, whatever gets me some ""ME"" time LOL  I grew up on live bait and spinner rods - but hoping to learn some techniques here that I can pass on to my 5 year old daughter (and hopefully my future kids)  -Eric"

My daughter and I have had CCMT and his daughter over for a fun day of fishing and stuff so you never know.  you might run into others on the board in your area too willing to hook up for a bit."

622310,Default User,2011-09-17 16:43:00,72,"I can't believe how active this board is  Thanks for the warm welcome  @GBW - I'm by Scarb/Pickering area (near the Toronto Zoo)  I usually head to FBay, DCreek, or WM for a little time killing cast.  Golf is something I picked up durin my ""suit"" days. Hard to give up now because a lot of my buds are just starting to get into it - and they suck! It's just too much fun watching them mess up so bad. (alcohol may be a factor in their playing ability, though)  Thanks again folks I'll post some pics of the minnows I catch LOL"
