621723,Rizzo,2011-09-15 15:15:00,4754,"definitely fishing! I passed by an hour ago and things looked fine other than the odd shower (unless wind has picked up since then). As long as you're not in a rubber dingy I'd say go, you can always stay close to shore."
621724,Skipper D,2011-09-15 15:23:00,1970,"Thanks , just did'nt want to take an hour to get out pass Big Bay Point in rough water , done it to many times last week , this time thought i'd ask first , the rain is forcast but its hard to stay seated when the sun shows thru...... lol ."
621789,RickOnt,2011-09-15 17:48:00,669,Hey Skipper  This report might be a little late for Ya!  But as of about 1300Hrs we have winds from the WNW at about 25-30 Klicks!  So unless you are going to fish the very west end or tight to the North shore of K-Bay I would not make the trip over.  and out at BBP it will be rolling Whitecaps for sure.  Rick
621820,Skipper D,2011-09-15 18:48:00,1970,"Thanks Rick , i solved the problem of having to decide , i fell a sleep right after i made the posting , just woke up now 2:45 , i think i needed it . After what you said i am glad i am not out there , spendt eight hours in that last saturday"

621873,Skipper D,2011-09-15 20:43:00,1970,"  Hi there SMALLY , Not so  every will think i am totaly incapable  , i was useing the weather network on line to get the marine focast but foud it no wheres ner accurate for the most part once i got out there , i was'nt aware of any cams on the bay but you know i've never checked before , i'll have to have a look online and see if there is such a link , hell that would be great if there was . But hec  asking some one on here that might live on the bay would be first hand i thought as i would be first to reply to some one if i did ."
