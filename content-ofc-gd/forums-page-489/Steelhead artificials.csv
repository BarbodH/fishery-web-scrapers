620890,BillM,2011-09-13 01:55:00,17367,"I usually water harden and that's it..  I never cure brown or steelie roe.  A good rule to follow is this.  If the water is stained (8-12inches of vis) You'll wanna run bigger/brighter bags.  If the water is clean (2ft - unlimited) You'll wanna run a smaller presentation perhaps in peach or white..  It really does depend on the water you are fishing..  Early in the fall you'll still get the odd hatch out, so tossing a stone or similar down there might be the ticket.  Once the salmon are in the river and on the spawn, roe will be your go to."
620901,solopaddler,2011-09-13 02:17:00,8605,"  Always carry a small baggy of chum (loose uncured salmon eggs).  A little bit of candy thrown in the pool will usually garner a hit or two.   Many guys overdo it though, throwing ridiculous amounts of roe in the water.  Less is better.  If you think there's 10 fish in the pool, throw 10 eggs. Good rule of thumb to follow.  It's not something I personally do a lot of, but it's a deadly effective tool to have in your arsenal for those times that warrant it.   Once you've chummed follow it up by drifting either a single egg or an egg imitation."
620909,BillM,2011-09-13 02:26:00,17367,"Also watch out for candy being whipped into the run by your buddies, lol!   I've been the victim of more then one chum attack."

620919,newb09,2011-09-13 02:47:00,49, if you are using Marabou Jigs make sure not to put any scent on the feather. It will affect their action in the water.
621025,Harrison,2011-09-13 13:41:00,2202,"That is gold there.  Good on ya solo.  I am a hardware guy in the fall.  Love my tubes, power minnows, maggots, jigs and worms.  But around Dec I will go back to roe once I get my favourite type in Nov!  I got Worms too."

621459,bassnass,2011-09-14 15:43:00,174,"There’s a lot of great info here - but it's true what they say: ""There's no substitute for time on the water"".  Granted, fishing time can be hard to garner (there is just never enough) - but nothing has improved my learning curve more than picking a creek and trying to hit it daily - even an hour or two.  Pay attention to everything you see - especially the fish.  Experiment and learn what works, when.  If you think something's going to work and doesn't - don't be too quick to trash it - try it out now and then, again.  If I had set hard and fast rules about what didn't work because it didn't work the first time, I'd probably feel like NOTHING works (we've all had those days).  While I believe failure teaches you more than success, set your standards by your successes more readily.  And always, experiment.  Vary your presentation.  I've drifted some fish repeatedly with roe, and then pink worm, pink worm, pink worm, and then worm, worm, worm, and then nym-BANG!.  Start with what you feel most confident in (wherever that confidence comes from) and change it up from there.  Never say never, either – as the 10” pink worm anecdote from this thread demonstrates – fish haven’t read the same magazines as all of us, and they don’t follow the “rules”.  I’m sure my man doesn’t fish those 10-inch pinkies all that often, but I bet he keeps a few in his vest, now.  Changing your presentation doesn’t just mean changing what’s at the end of your line, but also how you’re delivering it to the fish – floating/bottom-bouncing/hot-shotting/holding/drifting/retrieving/speed? – leader length/material/test/colour – line material/test/colour – swivel(s) size & placement – weight(s) size & placement – depth your fishing – hook size/colour/type -- drift-line (I’ve seen 2” closer to a log jam on a bend make all the difference).  I often think that what's on the hook isn't as important as all the rest of it.  The mind boggles.  Use your common sense and confidence as a starting point and lean on your experience to guide your experimentation / fine tuning.  Most of us have come a long way from spin-casts and red-and-white plastic bobbers.  Keep comin’ -- don’t get bogged down by the infinite possibilities in presentation – that’s where the fun is!  Presentation variation is a must because the trout change, the creeks change, and each tributary has it’s own unique characteristics.  Trout activity and response is something that changes, HUGE – almost constantly.  I’ve had days where trout come shooting out from under a bank five feet away, careening across the surface to slam a roe-bag I was retrieving back up through middle of the current in order to make another cast.  Other days, if it doesn’t come within a 3” ‘bubble’ around their head, they won’t even look at it.  One day, I spent 30 minutes working a big girl that was holding under a log.  I eventually got frustrated and ‘crashed the creek’, at which point I realized this fish was asleep.  I walked up to her, took a bunch of pix and vidy, and stroked her once or twice.   Then I woke her up and she hastened off.  This brings me to my next suggestion for variation.  Change your tactics.  We all creep around like ninja commandos trying to stay slow and low and out of sight so as not to spook our wary adversaries.  Not me.  Not always, anyway.  That big trout I woke up – I caught her a little later that day - 26 inches of niceness.  Now,  “Crash The Creek” is a tactic in my arsenal.  Not only will I rudely awaken slumbering slimers, I’ll bust up any ice  if I find it’s hindering my drifts.  Keep an open mind.  After you’ve broken up that annoying ice form, the trout may just do a couple laps around the pool and be ready to hit a 10” pink worm.  Changing tactics can also include changing location – move up or down stream – or move to another stream altogether.  We all love that ‘green perfection’.  Often times, the next  creek ‘over’ will be exhibiting diametrically different conditions than the one you're at – high, dirty or just filled with snobby trout.  So it MIGHT be a good time to try another creek.  Running and gunning to try and find beautiful green water on a creek SOMEWHERE is fine and dandy, but I’d encourage you to stick it out on the creek you’ve been fishing.  Keep experimenting with your presentation and which areas of the creek you’re fishing.  Most guys won't fish high, dirty water, but I will - only because I was there the day before, knew there were trout in the creek - knew where they were  - started in those spots and moved until I found out how they react to high dirty water and what was working.  You might be pleasantly surprised.  The more you learn, the greater your experience, the more apt you’ll be to fish difficult conditions with at least some success – taking advantage of the time you have.  As you do start to hit a few different creeks you’ll probably notice that each stream has it’s own ‘personality’.  Aside from general classification (creek, stream, river), and as much as “fish are fish are fish”, I’ve found that every body of water fishes a little differently than the last, generally.  Put your time in, and you will start to pick up on subtle and unique characteristics that will help give you an extra edge.  From my experience, if I'm fishing a creek ""cold"" (meaning, it's the first time I've fished it at all, or in a while), I'll at least have some idea what areas to target and how, given whatever conditions. Experience is the best teacher, and every experience teaches you something.  Get out there and experience it!  Keep an open mind and go with what you know. And remember to enjoy yourself - you're fishin'!"
621482,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-14 17:48:00,0,"lots of good ideas here.  throw a few crappie tubes in your arsenal. (i've done very well in dirty water with a clown colour on more than one occassion)... and nothing elicits more vicious strikes than pink wormin' it but be warned, a 6"" pink worm may also shut down a pool as often as it elicits hits. truth be told, most of my fish still come on roe."

621699,MJL,2011-09-15 14:16:00,2427," But Rich he said for float fishing  But I totally agree. For hardware, Jointed raps as well as the jointed thundersticks can be deadly in rivers.  Steelhead just smash them.  Mike, if you're in the Cobourg/Port Hope area anytime soon, see if you can hunt down Henry Lee.  He makes hand-craftted wooden lures that work very well."
621749,BillM,2011-09-15 16:21:00,17367, Love throwing crappie tubes and similar in the spring!
621965,Rich,2011-09-16 00:23:00,3927," My bad! Sassy shads are great little float fishing baits.. better yet a Gulp Minnow or Goby.  And yah MJL I love the jerkbaits.. jointed are good for straight runs & long casts, but the other jerkbaits are great too. The only steelheading I enjoy actually, is with a jerkbait. It's like river fishing for smallies, same deal. Twitch, twitch around that logjam.. and out darts a silver beast! Sure beats a bobber (sorry ""float"", for those trout pros)"
622078,BiggFish,2011-09-16 14:51:00,40,"Hey Folks,  I have to agree with my buddy Rich, Jerkbaits and jointed cranks are what I throw and the steelhead just smash them where i fish.  Some days I get 3 or 4 in less then half hour and all on orange and black or silver and black 4 inch Rapala Husky Jerks, oh yeah and the blue and silver also.  Only two more weeks in Southern Ontario before it is on.  Chad"

620730,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 19:45:00,4661,"I'm looking to do some float fishing for steelhead this fall/winter/spring...  Over the last 2 years I've researched artificials for steelhead and people seem to be doing well on these options...  I have  Wooly buggers in pink, olive, and black  Steelhead jigs in pink, purple, and orange  Trout beads  Soft artificial eggs 6&8 mm in tangerine color  And pink berkley worms...   I think I have a good selection  But how to use thus stuff?... And dose this stuff work?  Do I add scent?  Am I wasting my $$$ on this artificial stuff?  Like I said... I primarily would like to float fish for these trout... But I find roe a pain in the rear end... And would like to avoid harvesting fish for their eggs...  Thnx  Mike"
620733,esoxansteel,2011-09-12 19:55:00,1307,"Your selection is good, but choice of baits will depend on the types of river you choose, faster flows vs slower flows experiment as different baits will work on different days etc, also choice of color will depend on the clarity of the water as well."
620736,BillM,2011-09-12 20:04:00,17367,"Early fall hardware can definitely be the ticket when the water is still a bit warm.  Once the cold gets here nothing beats nasty jam bags.  I like running jigs as well, but only in certain rivers."
620737,fish_finder,2011-09-12 20:06:00,370,"Hey Mike,  You can pretty much use any of those items the same way you would use roe or any other live bait.  Its basically going to be hitting the right depth, as well as fishing the right sections in any given run/pool, etc.  You should add some nymphs into that arsenal such as stoneflies, caddis, and mayfly nymphs.  When steelhead are young, they spend at least one year in their natal streams.  While there, they are feeding on nymphs more than anything else.  When they return to spawn, natural instinct takes over and they'll hit nymphs simply out of what they know as food from their juvenile years.  Dave"
620742,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 20:16:00,4661,How do you determine wich presentation you use on a given day? River? Or pool?
620747,BillM,2011-09-12 20:26:00,17367, Get out there and figure out what works.  It can change daily.

620754,misfish,2011-09-12 20:48:00,29133,  I can only find the small 3 inch ones.Where to buy the larger ones?
620762,daryl0815,2011-09-12 20:56:00,225," I find that like a lot of species, trout prefer brighter colors when the water is stained, and more natural when it is clear, having said that I have caught trout on the pink worms in clear water, I would pick up some red berkley worms also, I have done really well on that color in the past. I also like to use live worms, but smaller 2-3inch ones on a small #8 or 10 salmon hook below a float. Obviously lighter line, and smaller flies/artificial in clearer water. I find the perfect color for the water is the greenish tinge with about 3-4 feet of visibility, which usually occurs a day or 2 after a good rain.  Try fishing the head of a pool, where the fast water goes into the deeper slower water, throw your rig into the shallower water and let it drift down into the deeper water so that the rig is at proper depth as the water gets deeper, alot of active fish will hold in the head of the pool and wait for a meal to get washed down to them, so if you start your drift in the deeper section of the pool, you might pass over some active fish.  Also try to fish the seams where the fast current breaks with the slower water, and back eddies, it allows a bit of a slower drift, while still presenting the bait to trout that are holding in the current.  The tail end of pools, and current breaks like big rocks, I find holds less active fish, but they still can be caught, always remember to let your drift go as long as you can stand it, sometimes you will be surprised how many fish pick up a bait at the end of a drift. Fallen trees and blow-downs that provide shade can be key when the sun is high also.  Sometimes a bottom bouncing rig works better than a float, so experiment a little bit if you aren't getting anything after a while using one presentation.  Also remember to talk to fellow anglers, sometimes particular rivers will have certain colors that outproduce others, so talking to someone who fishes there a lot can come in handy.      "
620764,MJL,2011-09-12 20:58:00,2427," Riverwood makes 3 inch ones but fatter.  Berkley makes 4 & 6"" pink worms as well - I know Lebaron carried them at one time. I've used pink worms up to 10 inches (My friend got them from BPS in Florida) and I managed to win $25 and a McDonalds apple pie...My friend bet me I couldn't catch a steelhead with one...But I did"
620766,daryl0815,2011-09-12 21:04:00,225,"   Haha and a Mcdonald's apple pie!  I caught some in the spring on riverwood worms fished almost weightless, wacky rigged like senkos, the trout were actually chasing them it was awesome."
620767,misfish,2011-09-12 21:06:00,29133," Thanks bud. 10 inch  Food for thought.  If it,s an apple pie to get you to trick my tricks,Im buying."
620773,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 21:24:00,4661,"So if I'm at a pool with fish in it... How long or how many drifts do you give a presentation before changing up...  Like if I have a pool with 10 steelhead in it to myself...  Do you ""run and gun"" threw your presentations... Like no hit in 10-20 minutes change up?"
620774,daryl0815,2011-09-12 21:28:00,225," pretty much yes, change colors/baits after 20-30 minutes with no action,  but make sure you cover the water, dont repeat the same drift over and over again, one you dont want to spook the fish too badly, and 2 sometimes all it takes is a foot one way or the other to make all the difference."
620777,misfish,2011-09-12 21:41:00,29133,"Im sure things have not changed since I was doing it back 20 or so years. When I fished a slow pool,I went with a single egg under a float. I boiled my own.Added some cod liver oil to the jar and a hint of ennece(sp?).  Anyone else?"

620782,misfish,2011-09-12 21:56:00,29133," Yes. Not to much. The oil preserves the egg. I should warn you.If you do boil yer own,send the wife and kiddies out for a few hours,or you can do it like I did after learning   . Use a portable burner outside. When you boil yer own,you want to see an eye in the egg. That to me is the milking of the egg. If you over boil,then you might aswell buy mikes eggs in a jar.  Man Im getting back my old school stuff.LOL"

620788,Bernie66,2011-09-12 22:25:00,123,"Gagnon in Oshawa had some Gulp saltwater 3"" trout worm left over from there Aug sale for $1.99.  They had them in chartreuse, peach and orange.  They seem to be thicker than the originals.  Good to try in dirtier water on a small jig head. They still had a poop load of them lastweek."
620794,misfish,2011-09-12 22:33:00,29133," Just take a pot of water,add some salt. As the water is about to boil,add a cup of eggs. Stir gently.Once they come to the top,allow them to boil til you see the orange eye in the white egg. Scoop out and put in the jar of oil/Anise right away,dont allow to cool.They will plump 1/8 the size.   I tried this once while doing beets for canning. You talk about red jewels. It,s all about the right temps.If the eggs cool to much,they will harden and will not absorb. If they are still hot,or warm,they will aborb the scent/colour."
620797,mike rousseau,2011-09-12 22:40:00,4661,So you boil till they are milky outside and orange inside...  Then scoop em into oils of choice...  What's the end result like??  Firm centers?  Or do they pop when a hook touches them?  I'm assuming they are firm...  And when you have the boiled eggs in the jar... Do you refridgerate? Freeze? Neither?  Shelf life?
620800,misfish,2011-09-12 22:47:00,29133," Boy you sure are stetching my memory here.  The white part if firm. The gold eye (as I call it) is the milking/scent. I would pop the hook through the yellow eye ,then through the white.  Like I said,I would make a cup full.This would stay in the fridge for the fall and spring months."
