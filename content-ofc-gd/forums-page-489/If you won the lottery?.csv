621852,canada414,2011-09-15 19:52:00,40," Definitely my choice too. Probably Baccarac in Mexico. Maybe Nunavut for char, lakers and greyling"
621892,tb4me,2011-09-15 21:23:00,3295,"Thats simple...If I won a ton of money, my deram fishing trip would be my frends dream fishing trips. I would take all my fishing friends where ever they wanted to fish.."
621906,Musky or Specks,2011-09-15 22:02:00,2710,Also Big Hole River Grayling before their wiped out.
622131,jimmer,2011-09-16 19:32:00,2730,"Australia, then the amazon to get them out of the way. Then off to all the Canadian places I have dreamed of."
622157,danc,2011-09-16 21:32:00,4677,"I'd just keep fishing the same places that I do now, except more often. And I'd be spending the nights in a Prevost motorhome."
621553,misfish,2011-09-14 21:15:00,29133,"  LMAO Oh are you going to get a slap Paul.   Can you say  New truck New house    New home trailer,to do every Nascar race of the season.  I might fish during the travels."
621554,smally21,2011-09-14 21:18:00,993,fly in to just about everything north of sudbury.  the grand slam of marlin sounds like a lot of work - i think id just hire you to do it for me....
621557,Ron,2011-09-14 21:29:00,1683,"My dream trip would be Perchin on Simcoe, with my wife and daughters of course!"
621569,crappieperchhunter,2011-09-14 22:25:00,2582,"Like others...I'd probably never leave Ontario to fish...just too much beautiful water to cover here at home. However my boat, tow vehicle and cottage would get some real serious upgrading"
621577,scottyswing,2011-09-14 23:35:00,37,The first fishing trip i would go on is to the new lake i just purchased a cottage on in the Muskokas with my winnings.
621581,RickOnt,2011-09-14 23:57:00,669,I would take my three Sons and the Brother in law to Plummers.  and  The OFC G2G at Eddie's sounds like 'Fun'   Rick
621604,Leecher,2011-09-15 01:17:00,7832,"I'd buy land here in the valley (and lots of it   ) and build my own pond.... right in front of the house so that each morning, first thing I'd do is, sit down in a chair with coffee in hand and cast a line out from the deck"
621610,Terry,2011-09-15 01:52:00,14456,I did win the lottery   12 bucks on a scratch ticket  so I am fishing the Kawarthas this weekend..yippy
621617,nofish4me,2011-09-15 02:34:00,404,"Hell, win or not, I'm seriously considering this place. It's a ""Bucket List"" sort of thingy. I disovered this place through a fella by the name of ""Denny Crane"". No, I'm not, knowingly, going to expire anytime soon. Having said that, I'm flying out to Longview Alberta next month to see an iconic, singer/songwriter, before he passes or I do. Basically, he'll be playing in his backyard. His ranch is just down the road. Again, it's a ""Bucket List"" sort of thing. Next, would be to get myself a damned good rabbit dog, something that might actually place in a fied trial. Hahaha"
621621,MJL,2011-09-15 03:20:00,2427,"Ironically my lotto 649 dream would be to live like a hobo for a year and walk from one steelhead river to the next in BC.  After that, Iâ€™m game for just about anywhere for anything"

621629,SirWhite,2011-09-15 06:05:00,210,"Lol, probably the Kawarthas"
621634,fish_fishburn,2011-09-15 11:01:00,1311,"I would probably buy a nice little spot on the Vedder River in Chilliwack. I spent two weeks this summer fishing that river and it is so beautiful. What an awesome river.  It was my first time float fishing for salmon and I am hooked. Caught lots of Sockeyes but they are closed all season and had to be released. My first three days I was skunked but after I figured it out I was into the Red Springs. The absolute best Salmon I have ever tasted.  Its a small run so the fishing pressure is miminal.  Next year I am going back around the end of Sept, early Oct when the river is full of all the Salmon species. Tarpon fishing on the fly sounds interesting. Have to go to Florida for that one. Peacock Bass fishing for sure and White Sturgeon on the Fraser. World class Lakers on Lake Athabasca and Atlantic Salmon fishing in Newfoundland. That one is already in the works. Just to name a few."
621656,PainInTheBass,2011-09-15 12:44:00,102,  I am the same.  Cept I have no cottage.  Just owning a cottage would be an upgrade.
621662,Harrison,2011-09-15 13:00:00,2202,"It would allow me to put the time in and fish the way I want to.  I'd love to fish the FLW tour.  Take atleast a week to prefish each event, bring the wife and kids with me in one of those huge touring buses.  The gals can shop their little faces off while I fish.  Would be fun to not fish for the money, but for the competition against the fish and other anglers only.  It would be nice to have my morning coffee on a dock every morning too.  Preferably on a Muskoka lake."
621690,bucktail,2011-09-15 13:57:00,1857,Plummers and a trip to the Tree Turks and Caicos for bonefish. Great Barrier reef for black marlin. Costa Rica for Sails. My own place on Nipigon  Gee I havnt thought aboout this at all>>>>>>

621449,jedimaster,2011-09-14 15:09:00,3472,"If you won the lottery, what would you next fishing trip be like?  I think I would be in a brand new Allison XB2003 with a 300 drag motor down on okeechobee, searching for a 10 pounder.  Maybe down further south somewhere fishing for Marlins?"
621450,Fisherman,2011-09-14 15:14:00,7201,Keswick eh...
621451,Rod Caster,2011-09-14 15:14:00,5784,I'd hire Moosebunk as my personal full time fishing guide.  Arctic char would be my first target in the far north.

Some many options, so little $$$$$ and time! LOL  Colin"
