621756,dannyboy,2011-09-15 16:28:00,367,"What type of reel is it? I recommend learning to do it your self; most manufacturers have servicing information on-line, after that Google is you best friend.  Dan"

Assuming you can remove them a lot of guys will gently boil them to remove all the old grease and crud.  Or soak them in electrical contact cleaner or something similar.  Once they're degreased either a couple drops of sewing machine oil or soak in kerosene then reinstall.  Do not add grease of any type.  Chances are your reel will spin a lot better if you do this.
621767,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-15 16:54:00,0,i have found that if i clean my reel each time out and remove the sand and egg juices when i return home my annual maintenance is less.  all i use is a microfibre cloth and warm water.
621773,msp,2011-09-15 17:23:00,1336,After 10 years of steady use I finaly cleaned my reel. First thing I did was strip all the line and backing off the reel. Next thing was taking the reel apart. be carefull that you use the proper size screw drivers and dont force anything causing you to strip the screws. Next is taking the bearings out and soak them in some type of oil.  (Sewing machine oil as metioned )While your bearings are soaking in oil soak your reel parts in vinigar while adding baking soda and scrub with a scrub brush. Use a q-tip or old tooth brush to get all the hard to reach places.Wipe off with a clean towel and put your reel back together and you are good to go for another 10 years assuming you have not lost interest in trout fishing Here is a pic of my reel before it was cleaned. Good luck

622407,J-M,2011-09-18 03:48:00,65," I have to agree! It's amazing how well it sticks to everything! I've been a bit lazy with my centre pin lately and the goo is building up, I'm gonna have to try that vinegar/baking soda idea..."
