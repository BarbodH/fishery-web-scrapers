621645,NAW,2011-09-15 12:09:00,4022, I can say the same thing about you there Blair... Might take you up the ice shack offer again this winter
621671,bigbuck,2011-09-15 13:25:00,2449,"Good on you Nick for taking out some rookies. I think you've got them hooked now on fishing. It's a wonderful thing to do for a couple. My wife loves to get out and hunt lunkers with me but it doesn't happen too often so every time we do get to  go out, we make the most of it."
620998,Miracon,2011-09-13 12:50:00,200,"I know I mentioned how much you guys in here ROCK from all the help I received as a newbie! Well to top it off, Nick (N.A.W.) was incredibly kind and messaged me offering to take myself and hubby out on Simcoe for some perch fishing. We took him up on his offer and went out last night.  Nick was absolutely awesome at giving us great advice and he even rigged up a few lines for us. It was a huge pleasure meeting him and having the opportunity to maybe finally catch a fish after fishing Pigeon Lake and not even a bite.  We went out from Tiffen launch and tried a few shallower places. Nick caught a Gobey (and killed it) and Rob caught a Sunfish! Haha! But that was still better then me...zilch! We went further out then between 40 and 50' (I think) as mentioned by some one else here. And finally...my first fish! The perch were there and between us we caught about 50. About 13 or so were keepers.  Just as we were about to head back in...I caught this guy!!!     And finally got to be on the other end of the camera for some Fish Porn! Hehehehe!  Here was our dinner last night! (But by the time us amateurs finished cleaning them...we ate around 9:45 PM! Haha!)   Here is Rob trying so hard to filet exactly how Nick showed us on the boat. (It turns out our so-called awesome Berkley knife is CRAP! - But he did a great job in spite of it!)   And we saved the big guy for last (just hoping not to mess him up! Haha!)   Again...a HUGE thank you to Nick!  We are extremely grateful and it's always a pleasure to meet great people! And you weren't kidding...Simcoe Candy!"
621031,ccmtcanada,2011-09-13 14:02:00,7971,"Sweet fish porn!! LOL.  I have learned so much from members of this board, so keep on networking and before you know it you'll be a pro!!  I learned to filet a fish from Youtube!!"
621034,NAW,2011-09-13 14:05:00,4022,"It was a pleasure fishing with you two!  A slow day as far as Simcoe perch goes.  They havn't moved into the usual spots yet.  Another few weeks, and it will start to pick up.   Thanks for letting me keep some of the fish YOU caught..!  I think you lifted more fish then Rob and I combined    Made a nice little snack for when I got home.  "
621036,The Urban Fisherman,2011-09-13 14:09:00,2050,awesome report - congrats on getting your first fish!!!! it'll be an addiction from here on it... good job on taking them out N.A.W. ur a good dude!
621044,Miracon,2011-09-13 14:20:00,200,Thanks Urban!  ccmt - We were having troubles remembering exactly how Nick showed us to filet so we hit YouTube as well. I found a video showing the same method so we could remember. But we also found this one (it was beyond our skills though!)...    Nick is being too generous - he caught some of those! Haha!  And too funny...love the Bud in the pic! Great looking snack! We called ours dinner!
621051,fishindevil,2011-09-13 14:39:00,6254,awesome well done !!! its great to hook up with fellow members we do that very well...have a great time ..cheers
621057,oldphart,2011-09-13 14:58:00,665,"~~~Great post, SportyPaul, and I were out on Saturday, and it was very slow till we found a spot were the Terns were picking bait of the surface."
621068,adolson,2011-09-13 15:32:00,783,Nice work! I am jealous - I have this craving for perch lately..
621153,Miracon,2011-09-13 19:25:00,200,"Thanks Devil, phart and Dana (LMAO @ your profile pic!)! It sounds like a lot of people network here. We're hoping to be able to afford a little used outfit (alum boat, motor and trailer) within the next couple of years and then we can return the favour!!  Glad the fishing was good for you phart!"
621168,Skipper D,2011-09-13 20:03:00,1970,"Awsome , glad you were able to find them , i was driving out in ORO last night quoting a job and saw the water was calm and how i should have been out there , glad you had the luck and it was'nt a wasted trip out ................"
621171,solopaddler,2011-09-13 20:10:00,8605,"Well done, glad to see you succeeded!  Tip of the hat to Nick for the assist."
621184,Terry,2011-09-13 20:51:00,14456,looks like it was a good time
621187,misfish,2011-09-13 21:01:00,29133,"Seems just about right for this time of year. Give it a week or so.The bay changes fast,so does the bite.  Nice on ya Nick, for taking them out."
621188,NAW,2011-09-13 21:05:00,4022,"It's awesome to see people catch their first fish!  And Thanks Skipper-D, after I tried my first spot in 20' with nothing, I headed straight for the deep water like you suggested."
621193,Skipper D,2011-09-13 21:23:00,1970,  and at the time the big one was caught all that could be heard across Lake Simcoe was ..... FISH ON ! ........... lol........lol .   Any time my freinds
621204,capt bruce,2011-09-13 21:46:00,820,"Good job there N.W.A. this is what this place is all about , spread the word , fishing is a great way to get outdoors and meet some very good people .  tho remember the first trip is free soon you will be loooking at those boats 9 hp  ,30 is better 150 rocks ,15 feet ,20 feet , 35 , I need a washroom , rods and reels big baits little baits , we got ya , dont know anyone who OD'ed from his/her fishing addition , but I know many who are HOOKED . Pass it on we got to keep this thing going,. Great report NWA you the best . B"
621264,NAW,2011-09-13 23:56:00,4022," Ya, we where pretty happy to see that hog surface.  Considering all the dinks we where catching previously.  It started to peal drag, I thought we had hooked into a smallie.   To bad we didn't catch more like that  I must say, for two fishing rookies, they both got the hang of it very fast.  Miracon just dove right in, baiting the hook, and taking fish off the the hook too.  Like she's been doing it for years.  I don't normally get to fish when I have rookies in the boat, but I sure did this time."
621331,fishing,2011-09-14 03:03:00,167,Very nice pictures and reports. Great dinner and snack.
621367,Miracon,2011-09-14 08:33:00,200,When the big guy bit I almost thought it was a giant weed cause that is what I'm used to catching! But I could tell right away it was something pretty big! It was an awesome feeling reeling it in and not knowing what was on the end!!  And Thanks Nick! I did get the baiting the hook experience from going to the Kawarthas on the long weekend when I spent all my time feeding the fish!!!! They just kept eating the worms off my hook....laughing at me the whole time! But taking the fish off was new!  Nick didn't mention I was useless if the fish swallowed it though!
621399,corvette1,2011-09-14 12:34:00,1765,great report wait till you catch a hundred like that big one you can yell fish on
621473,Miracon,2011-09-14 17:07:00,200, Corvette...if we are ever to catch that many...we better get a hell of a lot faster at cleaning them or we won't eat for a week!
621605,corvette1,2011-09-15 01:24:00,1765,the more you do the faster you will get if you are just learning where a glove
621608,Miracon,2011-09-15 01:31:00,200, Thanks corvette! Will do!
621611,Nipfisher,2011-09-15 01:54:00,2449,Nick is a good dude. I new that after meeting hime for 10 minutes. Welcome in my boat or ice shack any time.
621612,irishfield,2011-09-15 01:56:00,26272,All I ever got from Nick was a leaky boat...  Great it all worked out and he got you on some fish !
