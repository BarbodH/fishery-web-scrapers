621566,docknocker,2011-09-14 22:04:00,36,"  Smelled something burning at work on tuesday afternoon, Like plastic Here in Kitchener Glad someone else smelled it. The ""Kids"" (they are all in thier 30s) that work for me all said I was having a stroke!"
621582,jim,2011-09-15 00:04:00,124," The forest fire in Minnisota, was burning all the garbage that people throw out, thats why it smells like burning plastic , instead of spruce!!"
621584,4x4bassin,2011-09-15 00:14:00,1025,"I live just north/west of Alliston and I smelled it as well (burning plastic) had to close all the windows , and you know what I can smell it again tonight in the last half hour , more of a wood smell this time. Maybe someone is having a bonfire but I don't know because it is raining out !"
621599,danc,2011-09-15 01:06:00,4677," The fire is burning in a virgin forestry area in Minnesota consisting of a combo of spruce/pine/fir and maple/birch/aspen. If you're gonna insult a place that you've never been to, at least learn how to spell the name of it. I've been there many times and it's a natural wonder to say the least. It's a shame that it's burning, but that's natures way I guess."
621635,Skipper D,2011-09-15 11:11:00,1970,"You think thats bad . We've got four farmers up here on Horse Shoe Vally Road spreaden'er , their putting it on heavy , man its bad , its that time of year those guys every where lay it on . Shure hope the fish don't get sick........................."

621112,lew,2011-09-13 17:45:00,12766,"It's been alot of years since I visited Barrie, but from the description you guys are giving some of the local inhabitants, maybe that's a good thing"
621115,Terry,2011-09-13 17:47:00,14456,it's the smell of smoke coming from the USA  Minnesota I think

621180,bucktail,2011-09-13 20:38:00,1857,Wind just shifted here in Burlington and you can smell it now and its not Hamilton!!
621181,lew,2011-09-13 20:41:00,12766,"I'm 15 miles north of P'Boro and we've had a burning smell in the air for awhile now too. Don't know if it's related in any way with Barrie, but who knows  We've also got a blue haze in the air to go with it."

621207,danc,2011-09-13 21:47:00,4677,"The Minnesota fire is producing an incredible amount of smoke. Yesterday it was coming right at us. Here's a satellite video of the fire in it's early stages on Sunday, and as you can see, if the wind is right, the smoke would certainly make it to southern Ontario.  Minnesota fire"
