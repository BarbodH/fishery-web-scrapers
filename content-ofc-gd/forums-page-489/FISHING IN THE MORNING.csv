621946,Fisherman,2011-09-15 23:45:00,7201,Have you checked the marine forecast..
621947,206,2011-09-15 23:47:00,563,I'd like to get out on Rice in the morn right after work @ 7am....but with the cold weather it might be a waste of time? Fish might not bite till sun is well up and warming the waters.
621953,Skipper D,2011-09-15 23:59:00,1970,"  lol..........not yet , but i have a few good web sites saved in my favorites now.........."
621956,Skipper D,2011-09-16 00:06:00,1970,"  I seam to be learning all the time , last few weeks fishing was no good because water was to warm so i waited , now the water might be to cold , o well i've caught e'm in both temps before , guess i was lucky but i was hoping the cooler water would yeid up my next time out ........................."
621986,Skipper D,2011-09-16 01:57:00,1970,"checked the forcast and things look good for the morning , guess i;ll go perch'en at 5 , hope i wake up in time , good night every one"
621991,Rizzo,2011-09-16 02:11:00,4754,"5?? It doesn't get light until 6:15'ish. Fishing in the dark and cold for perch you need professional help  ...or maybe you mean wake up at 5, hook up the boat, read the paper, go to timmies, read paper again (all 3 pages of it)and then go fishing! Apparently 4 degrees tonight so dress warmly, play safe and good luck!"
622015,northernpike56,2011-09-16 03:54:00,717,yea I wouldent bother heading out until its light out. too dark and cold outside and i heard the perch dont bite as well in the dark.
622022,Skipper D,2011-09-16 10:17:00,1970,"  Dam it , i slept in its 6 :15 , the Barrie web cam for the bay looks good but ya it looks cold , i better check the marine forcast .... man its late ."
622029,Skipper D,2011-09-16 11:30:00,1970,"For me i think its more about being the only one out there and to do that its got to be at 5:00 in the morning , its to late now for that now so i'll leave it and go to work and perhapes try at 4 or 5 tonight when i get back ."
622035,NAW,2011-09-16 12:27:00,4022,"There was one guy, with his boat sitting sideways in the launch, when I drove by at 7:50.  Only guy in the water.  So you could have been there at 7:45, and been the only one on the water.."
622124,Skipper D,2011-09-16 18:42:00,1970,"Hi there NAW , ONE GUY SITTING SIDE WAYS IN THE LAUCH, WHEN I READ YOUR POST I THOUGHT RIGHT AWAY ,SOME ONE SAW ME , NOW HE KNOWS WHO I AM  , BUT WAIT I DID'NT GO OUT TODAY ........... LOL"
