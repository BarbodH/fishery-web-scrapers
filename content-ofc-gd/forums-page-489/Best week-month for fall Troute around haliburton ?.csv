622498,boatdrinks,2011-09-18 16:32:00,11,Trying to plan our trip up to Red Stone lake next year. We typicality make it up mid summer and by then the trout have gone deep and stopped biting. What is the best time to go in the spring and fall? Right now im leaning towards September. What do you guys think?
622509,Sinker,2011-09-18 16:58:00,8692,Just keep in mind season closes on a lot of those lakes on sept. 30th.  I would go in the spring. Ya can't beat ice out trout!! Just when the bugs start is when you should be there. Usually the last week of april/first week of may is prime time!  S.
