621378,solopaddler,2011-09-14 11:18:00,8605,"Super interesting about the speed, thanks for posting.  That's a beauty of a fish as well, congrat's."
621388,Rizzo,2011-09-14 11:58:00,4754," ya I am the exact opposite. I'm never going the same speed. I'll try many speeds in the course of a day, plus when you throw in a real sharp zigzag you've got one guy going slow and one guy going fast...see who's they want!"
621393,mistaredone,2011-09-14 12:20:00,913,I've been trolling at 5 mph and cranked in a grandma as fast as i could skipping it on top of the water and had a big fish breach after it.  One of the coolest things ive seen muskie fishing.
621395,corvette1,2011-09-14 12:26:00,1765,nice ski.... hope the cottage stays brown and they don't cut the tree down
621396,lew,2011-09-14 12:27:00,12766," That's always been a favorite tactic of mine too Roger, and one that's produced more that a few very nice fish.  From my own experience though, I've always found the outside rod, the one that speeds up, to be the one that catches the most. Sorta like a fish following a bait but won't commit until you go into the figure 8  You see any difference on which one grabs the most fish ??"
621403,bassnass,2011-09-14 12:41:00,174,Nice!
621404,Miracon,2011-09-14 12:42:00,200,Awesome fish!  It's definitely on my bucket list to know what it must feel like to pull in something like that!  I'm assuming a Grandma is another fish being used as bait? Total Newbie question but trying to keep up! Haha!
621407,lew,2011-09-14 12:50:00,12766," It's actually a flatsided bait used for musky fishing, infact an excellent bait with a wide, slow side to side wobble.  http://www.muskyshop.com/modules/cart/navigate.php/nav_id/45"
621411,Rizzo,2011-09-14 13:00:00,4754,"same as you Lew, its the lure that has sped up that gets nailed. I can't recall the slow one ever getting hit. The good news is, the slow one is about to become the fast one and thats when they nail it! With the increased speed of the boat the hookset is a no brainer"
621422,ehg,2011-09-14 13:22:00,2666,"Hey Rizzo, whenever someone does a report of big muskies from the Kawarthas i remember as much as possible. Like Meely catching 50 inch fish on jointed Believers a few summers ago on Pigeon. The way you describe trolling spinnerbaits reminds me of an article i read 15+ years ago about some dude trolling big spinnerbaits on the Ottawa R. He would go fast, slow down and zig-zag all around over bumps topping off at 15 ft. He made a living guiding people to big muskies using this technique. By the miracle of modern technology i was able to find that article on the internet. Like most anglers he stretches the truth (and fish size) but this is a good article saying exactly what you are. http://www.gordellis.com/muskie/content/muskie-articles/article/muskie-master-bill-craig  I will try this method in future..."
621432,lew,2011-09-14 14:01:00,12766,"Thanks for the article Eric, some good reading there. Don't hear much about Craig these days but his name used to pop up quite a bit a few years ago  I sat in on one of his seminars several years ago at the Spring Fishing Show and found it to be very interesting.  He's definetely right about trolling big spinnerbaits over top of the weeds though as they sure do catch some nice fish."
621434,Miracon,2011-09-14 14:12:00,200,  Thanks lew! I guess I thought it was a real fish by the description of it jumping out of the water! Which anything will do being dragged behind a moving boat! Duh!  Much appreciated!
621435,Whitemikeca,2011-09-14 14:13:00,138,Nice SKI!  I am assuming it was on Pigeon.  10 MPH is crazy fast.  I thought I trolled fast with my believers at 6-7 mph.  I will have to try the thunderstick.  I have one in my box that has bearly ever seen the water.  Great report!
621437,lew,2011-09-14 14:26:00,12766," Your more than welcome Miracon, asking questions is how we all learn stuff."
621442,Rizzo,2011-09-14 14:43:00,4754," i can't get believers to swim anywhere near the speed I want to be going so I use them only in the fall when I slow things down. They have a great side to side wobble but for big speed I have to go with the storm baits, much more of a tight wiggle. Super shadraps are pretty good too for speed but they are smaller and still can't keep up with Storm when the boat is up on plane and people are laughing and pointing"
621443,Rizzo,2011-09-14 14:45:00,4754,"thanks for the link, haven't had a chance to read it yet but I'll give it a look later"
621509,Leecher,2011-09-14 19:11:00,7832,Nice muskie Rizzo    Congrats
621514,kickingfrog,2011-09-14 19:20:00,8333,"Hmmm, me trying to paddle my canoe at 10mph would not be fun at all. lol"
621520,Rizzo,2011-09-14 19:52:00,4754,in a stiff breeze you could make a big sail out of a tent fly  to get some extra speed...just remember you have to paddle back against the wind!
621542,Tybo,2011-09-14 20:48:00,1373,"Hey Rizz, I didn't know you could buy muskies. Nice fish."
621568,Rizzo,2011-09-14 22:21:00,4754,I was waiting for the comments from the cheap seats   Paul never disappoints
622322,Whitemikeca,2011-09-17 18:52:00,138," I use the 10' jointed on the deep ring, rod tip has to be up.  Sometimes they do surface but I just give them a few jerks to get them down again.  I am going by the spd on my GPS so it may not be 100% accurate."
622380,HTHM,2011-09-18 01:18:00,4082, With the size of you I can't see that as a problem....
620839,Rizzo,2011-09-13 00:43:00,4754,"Have had a good season for numbers of muskies in the boat this year, but not many with decent size. We were real excited to get out Saturday after a few days of stable weather and a beauty full moon. The day started out like the rest of my season - small fish and missed opportunities (when will I learn to figure 8 every time!!!) My partner had a 35 inch or so fish hit a grandma that couldn't stay submerged. We were trolling in approx 20 feet of water at ""summer speed"" - for me that's close to 10 miles per hour - to see if we could still trigger some fish with speed. Not many baits can run true while the boat is on plane! At one point we had dang jetskiers trying to jump our wake while trolling. Anyway, his Grandma was having some difficulty staying down, every once in a while was rolling up to the surface, skipping a couple of times and then going for a quick dive before resurfacing. He was frustrated and wanted me to slow down (we had previously trolled at a more moderate speed without success). I told him just a couple of minutes more, but not to worry since I had caught a fish the last time out when I had a supershadrap on that couldn't take the speed. While I'm telling him this, a musky comes flying through the air chomping down on Grandma during one of its surface runs! Didn't land the fish, but both had a real good look at it. Next was my turn, another dink on, another dink lost. I'd have to put this one on the rack to even get him to 30 inches! The little ones sure can jump though. This one went airborn right beside the boat with a 24 inch vertical, and spit the hook. If my partner had any reflexes he probably could have caught it in mid air. When I commented on his sluggishness, he remarked that the fish would have slipped through the gaps in the net...I guess I deserved that one. And then, just when it seemed like another day of small fish, this beaut came to pay us a visit    This fish measured 48 inches with a 20 inch girth, and came trolling a storm thunderstick in 20 feet of water. Its an area of boulders not far from a 10 foot weedy flat on one side, and 30 feet deep on the other side. Its a spot I found earlier this summer while driving around randomly. First couple of times I fished it produced nothing. Frustrating when you find what looks like the perfect spot, behind the backs of the guys casting the weeds, but the fish don't seem to be there! Being stubborn, I didn't give up on this spot, and good thing because the last 3 times there I've contacted fish! A 42 a few weeks back, the 35 incher referred to earlier, and then this 48. Now if only I had a GPS so I could more easily find it each time instead of lining up the brown cottage on this shore, with the willow on the other shore, with the..."
620843,Joey,2011-09-13 00:52:00,9122,"Beauty report Rizzo, that is one beauty ski!!!!  That must have been awesome to see the other ski going airborne for the grandma"
620844,Rizzo,2011-09-13 00:56:00,4754,Joey it reminded me of ocean fishing where they troll a bait that just skips across the surface - they don't even make an attempt at getting it submerged
620849,rufus,2011-09-13 01:04:00,267,Beauty!
620850,irishfield,2011-09-13 01:04:00,26272,Very VERY Nice Roger!!!
620855,mercman,2011-09-13 01:08:00,7054,Nice Musky my friend Seeing a lot more musky reports in here lately.The feedbag must be on this time of the year.
620873,Rod Caster,2011-09-13 01:39:00,5784,"24 inch vert! That's cool, even if its the little guys.  The big one is a prize indeed!"
620886,Pigeontroller,2011-09-13 01:52:00,2793,NICE ONE!
620945,lew,2011-09-13 08:44:00,12766,"Atta boy Roger, she's a beaut for sure !!  You put in your time, you got your rewards !!"
620968,ehg,2011-09-13 11:51:00,2666,"After many, many years of fishing musky in the Kawarthas 46"" is my best.  I remember you caught a 48"" last year as well. Very well done! You are doing something right."
620972,Rizzo,2011-09-13 11:57:00,4754,"wow, good memory ehg! I did get a 48 last year, just can't seem to break that barrier"
620984,fishindevil,2011-09-13 12:25:00,6254,nice ski bud !!!
620993,jbailey,2011-09-13 12:40:00,866,wow nice fish! congrats!
620995,johnnyb,2011-09-13 12:47:00,3413,"Beauty fish, Rizzo....my biggest ski came out of the Kawartha's at 47""...didn't have the girth of that one....curious about one thing though:  Had you slowed down by the time you got the big guy?"
621048,Rizzo,2011-09-13 14:36:00,4754,"hey jb, the two smaller fish were contacted at great speed (boat on plane), the big one was at a more of a moderate pace"
621054,ccmtcanada,2011-09-13 14:43:00,7971, Slipped through the net?? LOL  I'd never have guessed to troll while on a plane at 10mph!!!  Sounds pretty exciting though when the fish come up so aggressively!!  Beauty muskie there Rizzo!
621056,Harrison,2011-09-13 14:57:00,2202,Nice fish and great report!
621070,mistyriver1,2011-09-13 15:35:00,600,"Nice fish Rizzo, congrats !"
621297,mistaredone,2011-09-14 00:54:00,913,Wow 10 MPH?  I've had trouble with baits at 6 mph.  Nice fish man!!!
621301,Rizzo,2011-09-14 01:05:00,4754,"the only bait I have that can handle it without added weight is a storm thunderstick. Cheap bait but man can they swim. Grandmas and supershadraps do pretty good up to a certain speed, but after that they kind of roll up to the top, bounce across the surface until the lip hits the water, kick to the side, dive down a few feet, roll up to the top again etc. At a ""slower"" (5mph) speed a Grandma probably dives 18-20 feet or so, the way we were fishing his Grandma was never getting down more than 2 or 3 feet. Was driving my buddy nuts because he'd never seen a fish hit a lure that's porpoising and not swimming right...now he has! I tell you what though, fishing like this takes a toll on your gear! make sure all the screws are tight because action like this will shake a few things loose."
621302,Terry,2011-09-14 01:05:00,14456,10 mph  is that what I'm doing wrong 10 wow  and nice going
621303,irishfield,2011-09-14 01:06:00,26272,"The rocks come up, on GBay, fast enough at 5 or 6 Terry!"
621304,Terry,2011-09-14 01:11:00,14456,you've got that right
621308,Rizzo,2011-09-14 01:18:00,4754,"to be more precise the GPS my buddy had for the day was telling us 9.2 mph. I don't always fish this speed, especially now that the water is cooling I'll be slowing it down, but definitely not afraid to give it a shot, especially in the summer. Luckily it was still working for us on Saturday with the water being 69. I used to think 5 or 6 was fast until this past summer. We were at Little lake in Peterborough trolling some heavy spinnerbaits at a good speed when we came up on some weeds. As a bit of a joke to my partner (who already thought I trolled too fast)I put the hammer down, got the boat up on a plane and we watched our spinnerbaits skip across the surface to get away from the weeds...well don't you know it...a 39 inch musky nails this guys spinnerbait as it jumps across the surface, blades weren't even remotely submerged! That day I realized it is next to impossible to go too fast, and I've been at least trying out anywhere from 5-10 mph each time I fish. Don't be afraid to try it..plus the looks you get from people when they realize you have lines in the water is quite funny. ""Moron"" is probably a common thing they say"
621372,Handlebarz,2011-09-14 10:05:00,3790,"nice going  sometimes you have to mix it up to get them to go I know way to many people who will not change there speed as they have caught all there fish at one speed. Fishing  from 2.8mph-7mph is the norm in my boat give the fish what they want and see where it gets ya.  Very nice looking ski and the best part is you still have a 50"" to look for once you make that mark its kinda sad as you then want a 54"" and that is just crazy."
