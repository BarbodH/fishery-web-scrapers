622137,FrankTheRabbit,2011-09-16 20:01:00,479,BillM->Frogwater reel? Thrilla->Can't tell...Loomis reel (totally wild guess)?  Nice pics!
622142,BillM,2011-09-16 20:10:00,17367,"Yup, from Robb's first batch (#43)"
622149,ctranter,2011-09-16 20:26:00,543,"Do fly reels count?       Ok, fine!  Have a pin  "
622152,FrankTheRabbit,2011-09-16 20:45:00,479,"Nice pix! What kind of rod is in the 2nd pic? Nice reels too! Is the first one an Amundson? It looks similar to mine, but it's orange. The second one a Lamson?"
622153,ctranter,2011-09-16 20:50:00,543," First combo is Sage, 9' 8 wt VT-2 paired with 3880 CF.  Second is Amundson, 12' 7-8wt paired with Trend 9/10.  Ps. I love the fact that someone recognized the Amundson as this is one of my favourite ""lesser known"" fly companies."
622155,FrankTheRabbit,2011-09-16 21:09:00,479,"Oh crap. lol I just jumped onto Amundon's website and is that your photo on the front page? If so, nicely done.  I thought the first pic was the Amundson reel. lol It kinda looks like my TCR reel, but in orange. I'm more than happy with it. It's a great company, despite only have the reel for a month."
622156,ctranter,2011-09-16 21:19:00,543,"Haha, yep that's mine.  I took that pic while fishing with Amundson's Ontario rep (who is also a member on OFC) and he asked he could use it as a promo.  Never tried the TCR's but I've used a WW Feather Lite and was very pleased.  For the price, it has a great drag and is very light."
622177,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-09-17 00:39:00,1107,"        First pic's a huge Erie hen from a few years ago ,second is a nice buck and was playin around with camera angles with the waterproof fuji."
