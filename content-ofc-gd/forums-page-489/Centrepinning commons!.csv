622242,MJL,2011-09-17 06:40:00,2427,Great vid BCLT. Sweet fish.  This spring I took the centrepin out for the first time in a couple years for the carp and can’t remember why I just didn’t do more of it.  I’ll definitely be doing more of it next season.  Also eagerly awaiting the new Shimano few float rods due out next year which are geared more towards specimen-sized fish. I'm hoping to pick one up to use in some of the slack water areas of the Niagara and the St. Lawrence.
