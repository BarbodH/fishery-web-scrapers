(of course, im not asking for anyones favourite spots, just some tips for a new kid in town)"
621717,Rod Caster,2011-09-15 14:55:00,5784,"Use the search feature to look up some Simcoe reports, that's the best way to see how people are catching them. Good luck out there!"

621886,misfish,2011-09-15 21:07:00,29133,"Throw spinner baits,jerk baits and tubes on the north shore of the bay . Thats the best I can give you as a start.From there,you will learn."
