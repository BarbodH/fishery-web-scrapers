622050,BillM,2011-09-16 13:12:00,17367,"Yup, you aren't going to catch anything while driving on the highway for hours.  Put your time in on the water and you'll be rewarded."
622141,FrankTheRabbit,2011-09-16 20:06:00,479,"I finally have had one full year of river fishing experience and I will never go back. I find it fun exploring parts of the river and getting to know it as a personal friend. I've learned a lot over the course of a year and I look forward to many more years down the road. The only regret is I wish I had started this a lot sooner!  There are some really friendly people I've had the chance to speak to and there are obviously the same number of nut jobs as well. The good thing is, I can pick and choose who I befriend and it all starts with a courteous ""hello"".  See you out there and enjoy the upcoming season!"
622144,landry,2011-09-16 20:10:00,1005,"Oh and unless I drive 2 hours up north for pike/musky, there really isn't any other option for 20 pound fish from shore =(... is there?  Yes - you are correct there!!! Landry"
621364,MichaelAngelo,2011-09-14 07:16:00,65,"Last night we went for a drive around looking for salmon in the river near bridges, didn't find any. We drove to the mouth of the river and some kind of fish were making splashes, not sure if they were salmon.  There were about 4 guys fishing the mouth. We fished for about an hour and a half till 1:30am then called it a night. No bites for anyone."
621413,Rod Caster,2011-09-14 13:05:00,5784,"Man, your having a tough go at it!  Maybe your a walleye guy?"
621416,kemper,2011-09-14 13:09:00,2232,"If you had found a fresh run of browns and bows would you have posted that?  ...I don't understand why posts like this continue to happen, or why they are allowed to continue. Posting names of small rivers (even lakes) on a forum with as many members as this is a brutal idea"
621418,Spiel,2011-09-14 13:13:00,9065,"  Agreed and I'm going to start reining it in, as per the forum rules.  ""Please do not post VERY SPECIFIC information on fishing spots, ie pinpoint locations and maps. It is our belief that sharing this type of knowledge to the general public is not at all good for the resource itself. When communicating info on spots, please keep it to email or a PM. """
621433,cjgraham,2011-09-14 14:06:00,104,Once again I love livingin northern Ontario!
621770,GreenCanada,2011-09-15 17:19:00,375,"   Why bother asking the OP if they would have posted something about browns and bows, when they never even mentioned the river they fished on that night? Can we no longer post, ""hey, I went fishing last night for a couple hours and got into a big run of bows and browns""? The OP didn't even make mention or hint to any possible water body.  So, instead of commending the OP for not naming the river they were speaking of their thread gets flamed because of other peoples posts, from the past.  It's posts like this that make other users, both new and old, rethink sharing their experiences on the water. Do I enjoy sharing my stories with others? Hell yea, but I don't need harassment like the OP received.  THEY NEVER MENTIONED A RIVER OR WATER BODY SO GET OVER IT!  (Disclaimer: If the OP's original post was edited to remove any specifics, it is not alluded to in the thread)"
621774,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-15 17:26:00,0," plenty of people in the north watching for real time updates on rivers as well.   river names don't really add anything to the report for MOST of us, so don't bother including them.  i'm more interested in creative photos and stories then i am where you caught it.  we all have our own spots, let's keep it that way!"
621777,fish_finder,2011-09-15 17:28:00,370," Heh.....When rivers get named on open forums, it tells me exactly where NOT to go!!!"
621781,Spiel,2011-09-15 17:37:00,9065," The OP did mention the river and the exact locations on it! Then I edited it, I thought my post would have led everyone to realize that!"
621784,cjgraham,2011-09-15 17:41:00,104,  Even the best of rivers around here are not over fished. let alone most guys around here could care less about bows and ho's. I've fished the southern ontario rivers and I count my lucky stars.
621787,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-15 17:47:00,0,i still see no need in ever mentioning anything that might give away your location.  that is if you want to keep them less pressured.  p.s.  i had someone this spring from this forum creep on a spot because of one of my reports...
621790,BillM,2011-09-15 17:49:00,17367,"Getting greased out in northern Ontario, man that's brutal, lol!!!!"
621791,cjgraham,2011-09-15 17:51:00,104,  Your right there is no need for river name dropping. plus most of the rivers on the north shore you can tell just by the stain of the water. lots of good spots and good hikes out there best background for fishing pics is bush.
621824,Musky or Specks,2011-09-15 18:51:00,2710,Where was that??
621833,MichaelAngelo,2011-09-15 19:09:00,65,"Hi guys first off I want to appologize for breaching forum rules.  But don't people name water bodies every time they post a fishing report?  I had a good time today, caught my first salmon.  I've come a long way since I joined this forum, first pike, first salmon.  So I also want to extent my thanks to those who've helped me learn."
621834,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-15 19:10:00,0,bronte.  i had secret hole until i posted it online!

621842,cuzza,2011-09-15 19:25:00,467, Nooooooooo - my secret creek and special bait leaked onto the internet in one post  
621853,adolson,2011-09-15 19:53:00,783," Yes, I *usually* post the name of the water body when I post, especially if it's a common lake that others in my area are keenly aware of. For example, you'll see posts of mine from Anima-Nipissing and the Montreal River, two large bodies of water that are certainly no secret. And smaller lakes such as Sharpe and Gillies...  Why? Because I interpreted the forum rules as ""don't post VERY SPECIFIC spots"" and not ""don't post names of water bodies."" But maybe that's just me, because that's what the rules actually say..."

621977,landry,2011-09-16 01:12:00,1005," Steelheaders can be touchy and defensive - I no longer river fish and used to love it but I got sick of all the selfishness, bravado and battling for space and supremacy. I love steelies but I love solitude and relaxation/cooperation in boat fishing more. People need to relax - it's a salmon run - who really cares!!!!!!! Landry"
622017,MichaelAngelo,2011-09-16 04:35:00,65," Yes but... try telling that to somebody who's only ever caught meesly panfish and baby bass all their life XD.  When I was a kid I saw the salmon running and it was a great moment that cemented the fishing hobby for me.  edit:  Oh and unless I drive 2 hours up north for pike/musky, there really isn't any other option for 20 pound fish from shore =(... is there? edit2:  unless I pull a Jeremy Wade teeheeee"
622018,manitoubass2,2011-09-16 05:19:00,11391,"I'm just glad we don't get fishing pressure on that scale in my parts.  People don't even believe there are fish in this river, so I can tell em all my spots without worry"
622044,johnnyb,2011-09-16 12:56:00,3413," Spring pike....lots of guys do well in the shadow of downtown TO. Could always take up Carp fishing....20 lbs is a small one....  I would say though, if you want to catch a salmon, stop driving around and focus on one spot.  All you'll end up doing is beating your confidence to a pulp, while hearing about how people were catching at a spot you skipped out on, or got skunked at the night before.  Pick one pier, hit it from 11pm-3am, and keep a glowing spoon in the water for as long as you can.  Go for a couple weeks and you'll learn a few things."
