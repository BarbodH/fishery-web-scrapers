622063,Fish Farmer,2011-09-16 13:41:00,2234,"Barbless is great, but if your live bait fishing, good luck with that."
622100,ctranter,2011-09-16 16:04:00,543,"I'm surprised more people aren't going on about barbless musky hooks considering how passionate people are about these fish.  If bolt cutters are an ethical requirement, and the fish is all fragile and delicate, why not fish with 100% barbless hooks so after you cut them, they can fall out easier?  Also, wouldn't it be easier to release a musky as quickly as possible without even taking it out of the cradle with barbless?  These hooks are usually huge, so this seems logical to me."
622114,crossover,2011-09-16 17:32:00,172,"i fish hookless, 100% less damage"
622115,Headhunter,2011-09-16 17:35:00,5703,Care to elaborate? Or is this simply a typo? HH

622128,jedimaster,2011-09-16 19:21:00,3472,"There is a Barb at work I would like to pinch.  I fish almost exclusively for Bass, and as such I don't pinch the barbs down. However when I do go pan-fishing int he spring I use barbless. I should have used a barbless hook when I found my ex wife. I could have thrown her back easier."
622133,Raf,2011-09-16 19:35:00,3495," barbless muskie fishing is slowly gaining ground but i think many people who are targeting these fish do not want to risk losing 'the fish of a lifetime'.  if hooks wont pop out easily and you decide to cut hooks, what's left of them will fall out barbs or no barbs.  to your 2nd point, the fish never leaves the net/cradle/water during the unhooking procedure."
622134,solopaddler,2011-09-16 19:41:00,8605,    It was a joke.
621638,fish_fishburn,2011-09-15 11:32:00,1311,"Was out in B.C. this summer fishing and was introduced to barbless fishing for the first time. Didn't really know what to think but after doing it it makes total sense to me. B.C. is 100 0/0 barbless for everything throughout the whole province.  My experience was that my hook-up, loss ratio was really no different then fishing here with barbed hooks. Was actually quite suprised by that, as I thought I would lose alot more fish. The best part was releasing non targeted fish as the hook pops out with no effort what so ever, and no damage to the fish.  Now having experienced barbless fishing I find it odd that its not implemented here in Ontario. My take is it's really no big deal but it's so much better for the fish survival when released. Whats your opinion."
621639,Roy,2011-09-15 11:40:00,13728,"They are a good thing. Barbless doesn't have to be ""legislated"". If you like barbless hooks, us'em."
621640,solopaddler,2011-09-15 11:53:00,8605,Dated this psycho chick named Barb back in the day. Was relieved to dump her and I've been happily Barbless ever since.  Barbless gets two thumbs up from me.
621642,ccmtcanada,2011-09-15 11:57:00,7971,"I fished barbless when I was in Alberta this year. I was a bit nervous about it, but like you I landed more than I thought I would. Makes you pay attention more and ultimately makes you better at fighting them I think.  The big pike put up a good fight too!  Fishing for bass in the slop would be a different story for me I think. When they get caught in the weeds I have a feeling I'd lose a lot more."
621643,fish_fishburn,2011-09-15 12:02:00,1311,"Roy, do you fish barbless?"
621646,woodenboater,2011-09-15 12:11:00,2277,"Usually the first thing I do when I pick up new lures, grab the pliers and pinch 'em down. I attribute a few losses to shakes but not enough to worry about and easy hook removal makes up for it. Nothing worse than trying to remove a deep set hook from a very agitated fish."
621650,Roy,2011-09-15 12:21:00,13728,"Barbless hooks are not widely available here but I'll often pinch or file the barbs down. It makes it much easier on the fish and much easier to release the fish. I don't know about the evolution of fish hooks but I imagine that back in the day, everyone fished for food on the table. They'd throw trot lines out and leave them there for hours/days even, and the barbs would help keep their fish on the line. Nowadays, people fish less for the table and more for the sport and relaxation. We're always in contact with our line so we don't really need barbs. It'd be nice to see a few more people going barbless without having to regulate it."
621651,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-15 12:35:00,130,Barbs for single hooks here. There are a few occasions where I wish the hook would come out easier but not too many at all.
621654,TJQ,2011-09-15 12:40:00,7806,"We fish barbless pretty much all the time, i got sick of wounding smaller fish before i put them back. Fishing with barbless hooks makes taking them off the hook soooooooo much easier. Unless you absolutley have to get that fish in the boat, i dont see why everyone doesn't do it.  As i get bit older ,, uuhhg.. it doesnt matter to me so much whether i get the fish in the boat esspecially if i know that they are just gonna get thrown back any way, and if im keeping them for the table, well.. its a more sportsman like challenge, and if ya keep your rod tip up, and your drags set right, your not gonna loose them any way. and if y do.. like I told my kids when they were 5, if ya loose it, don't worry, there will be another one right behind it. Now ive got great kids who love to fish for the sake of fishing, not the sake of eating...  Fishing barbless, is not only more sportsman like, it will help you be more attentive and a better angler as far as Im concerned, and Ive never dated anyone named Barb.  hmm keep your rod tip up... i think ill change my sig to that!!! LOL"
621655,fish_fishburn,2011-09-15 12:43:00,1311,True what you said Roy. Funny thing is in B.C. it's hard to find barbless hooks in any of the tackle shops I was in. And if you find them they are really expensive.  The way the C.O.'s check your hooks out there is the run the barb over their thumb nail and if it scratches the nail your busted.  I recall a few times I would change my hook and forget to pinch the barb and after a half hour or so remember and pinch the barb.  Good thing there was no fish cops around at the time.
621657,cuzza,2011-09-15 12:45:00,467,I fish crushed barbs most of the time - I fly fish mainly and can release a fish without touching it or taking it out of the water most of the time. If it needs netting (if it's bigger or I can't see the fly) the fly is normally out as soon as it gets in the net.
621658,dks,2011-09-15 12:47:00,36,"I use barbless 100% of the time. I ""caught"" my head with a barbed hook when I first started fishing years ago, and couldn't get the damn thing out myself (at the back of my head). Since then, barbless all the way."
621659,Musky or Specks,2011-09-15 12:57:00,2710,With barbless musky fishing I find I get better hook set
621673,Hud,2011-09-15 13:29:00,140,"I prefer barbless especially after I removed a hook from a buddy's hand.  Once I popped that hook out, been fishing about 90% barbless ever since.  Anything with more than a single hook gets the barb bent or snipped"
621684,adolson,2011-09-15 13:47:00,783,"I primarily target bass, not that it makes a difference, but I have lost a lot of them with barbed hooks. I want to be a better angler all around, so I think come next season, I'll start pinching some barbs on my trebles and see what happens... Worst case, I will lose every fish and I'll have to get better at fighting or go back to barbed... Maybe I could pinch the rear treble on my lures, and leave the barbs in the front hook until I gain confidence. The rare time I have issues getting little fish (usually pike) off my hooks makes me wish I had hook cutters, so barbless is where I want to eventually end up I think."
621696,Rich,2011-09-15 14:11:00,3927,I don't bother pinching barbs unless I've trout fishing. Everything else I'm confident enough in my skills to not deep hook any.
621700,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-15 14:17:00,4399,"Barbless makes a lot of sense,safe for the fish and the angler."
621719,adolson,2011-09-15 15:00:00,783," Hmm, yeah? That's mostly what I do... I often get pike by mistake, though, and one time a smallie somehow got hooked by my Hula Popper under the bottom jaw, from the outside, and it was near impossible to get out - luckily I was keeping that fish anyhow.  The worst hooking was a pike on my floating Rap with three trebles, so I took one of the trebles off and that seemed to help. I'd love to go down to one treble, but not confident enough, not sure which to leave on, etc.  Well anyhow, I do know I won't be pinching any barbs next time I try for an aurora. I'd add more barbs if I could.."
621721,TJQ,2011-09-15 15:06:00,7806, lol.. ya id say that would be my exception as well.
621758,GreenCanada,2011-09-15 16:35:00,375,"I fish almost completely barbless, for whatever species I am targeting. Less damage to the fish and no reduction in landing ratio. I also find it strange that in Ontario there are few restrictions on barbed hooks. Obviously there are a variety of barbless only regulations across Ontario, but I think this needs to be revisited and possibly changed to all barbless.  After having travelled West last month and having the opportunity to fish countless locations, one regulation that I found in Alberta (Bow River) that I feel should be implemented for the Credit River and all other heavily pressured Salmonidae habitats in Ontario is a barbless only catch and release program for anything over 30cm. This would ensure a productive fishery that produces quality fish, encourages recreational fishing, and protects our environment for decades to come."
621814,Jigger,2011-09-15 18:39:00,1237,"I fish my muskie lures 100% barbless and am starting to think ill go barbless on my worm hooks as well. Got a few bass this year that absolutely inhaled senkos. Even going through the gills and reversing the hook out, i found the barb was a big hinderance. More than one met the knife because the damage was too significant."
