Arrived early Saturday morning at Nakina International and checked through security and weighed the gear and got loaded up.       My son Brad was exicted about the flight perhaps a little too exicted I think he was looking to get a little seat time behind the stick in the end he settled for the co-pilots seat!     An hour later we arrived at the cabin our home for the week and most didn`t waste much time in doing one of the two things we came to Richter to do... fish!  The Walleye fishing was pretty consistant through out the week nothing insane like the earlier groups reported but we had no trouble catching limits of eye`s. 39     The pike fishing was consistant as well with lots of snot rockets but no real monsters Richter is not a trophy pike lake by any means.    And the big Pike for the week a 38.5"" fish tried really hard to get to the 40"" mark just came up a little short.       The other thing I mentioned earlier was eating and boy o boy did we eat, rabbit stew,bacon wrap Walleye,baked Walleye,deep fried Walleye, I think we deep fried everything. I am glad I had my cholesterol done the week before! Ben and Joe doing up the bacon wrappers!  Rob sampling the bacon wraped Walleye.  The preferred cooking appliance for the week!  There are a few issue`s that should be looked after to ensure the comfort and safety of the customers and I am sure Eddie will have these issues ironed out before next season. The cast of characters for the week made this trip truly exceptional and I would not hesitate to share a cabin with these guys again. Rob and Jim Rice, Joe Carr hope I spelled the name right, Ben Beattie, and my son Brad. I would be remiss if I did not give props to our ""house boy""  Craig he went out of his way to make sure our trip went as smooth as possible,hang on to this guy Eddie he knows how to treat your customers!!!

621545,kickingfrog,2011-09-14 20:52:00,8333,"Mmmmmmm, Deep fried bacon wrapped walleye is my new favourite thing."
621572,solopaddler,2011-09-14 22:50:00,8605,"  Been making a variation of that for years. I usually marinate the fish in italian style salad dressing first then grill on the bbq and baste with a maple based bbq sauce.  They don't take long, they're ready when the sauce caramelizes.  Super yummy but very rich."
