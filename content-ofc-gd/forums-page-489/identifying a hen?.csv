621691,MJL,2011-09-15 13:58:00,2427,"At this time of year, the males will try to fertilize your shoes when you pick them up...Look for the kype and the canines."
621695,mike rousseau,2011-09-15 14:03:00,4661,males have a large head with hooked jaws...and a uniform body... kinda tall and thin...  females have a small head without hooked jaws... and a fat belly... shaped more like a trout with a less tall body and thick across...  in some cases you can give the belly a sqeeze and see what comes out...
621697,BillM,2011-09-15 14:12:00,17367,Anal vent of the female should be extremely visible this time of year.  She'll most likely be squirting eggs with a slight push of her belly.
