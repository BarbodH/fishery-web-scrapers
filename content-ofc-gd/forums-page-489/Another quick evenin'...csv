622181,Muskieman,2011-09-17 00:47:00,2472,"Once again a Friend and I went out for a quick.. catch & keep limit  I picked up Shawn at 18h00 the boat was in the water by 18H15   and then being backed into the yard @ 19H20...  It was an action packed 45 minutes..boating 15 Walleye 5 of them in the slot and 2 around 10"" along with a few Rock Bass. My line was surgically cut by something with shoulders 2x.  ...My daughter took the pictures since I had slimy hands...     She also took the video ..  Now I've been cleaning my Walleye this way for over 20 years ... I find them easier to Rib and Skin with the ""Grip & Rip"" technique..   Anybody else do 'em like this?  p.s you might hear my drunken neighbor being himself by the end of the video.

622186,mike rousseau,2011-09-17 00:56:00,4661,Hey Randy... What's your slot size...?
622191,Muskieman,2011-09-17 01:06:00,2472, It's between 40 and 60cm...these Walleye are are all between 35 and 39cm.. the ones we released were  42-46cm. They're gonna be a good snack!   Randy 
622193,mike rousseau,2011-09-17 01:14:00,4661,So you can't keep 40-60cm fish?
622194,Muskieman,2011-09-17 01:16:00,2472, Right.....  limit of 4 ... 3 below 40cm ...  0 between 40-60cm and one greater than 60cm.......  or 4 below 40cm
622197,mercman,2011-09-17 01:23:00,7054,Nice walleyes Randy Thems one of the best tasteing fish there is.
622198,Nipfisher,2011-09-17 01:27:00,2449, That's how we roll on Nipissing. The rest of the area is pretty much 42-60 cms. slot restriction.
622201,mike rousseau,2011-09-17 01:38:00,4661,We don't have a slot...  I'm glad... Our walleye are big for slots...
622213,Roy,2011-09-17 02:14:00,13728,"Thanks for the report, Randy. On the Larry, we can only keep 6 walleye and they must measure between 37 and 53cms."
622215,GBW,2011-09-17 02:21:00,8460,wapa-randy!
622218,beginner,2011-09-17 02:24:00,542,supper must be really good tonite!... nice keepers
622220,mike rousseau,2011-09-17 02:29:00,4661, On the Larry in Quebec...
622224,Roy,2011-09-17 02:39:00,13728," Yes, that's where I live. Did I say something wrong?"
622226,mike rousseau,2011-09-17 02:42:00,4661, Nope... Just the Larry in Ontario is 4 without a slot...  Just chatin Roy...
622227,Roy,2011-09-17 02:45:00,13728, I thought FMZ18 was max.4 with none greater that 46cms in length. I should look at the regs to refresh my memory.
622229,Roy,2011-09-17 02:49:00,13728,I think you're zone 20 eh?
622230,mike rousseau,2011-09-17 02:49:00,4661, The Larry is zone 20... Along with lake O  Wich has a slot...  But the Larry has an exception to the rules... No slot 4 fish...

622271,Leecher,2011-09-17 12:39:00,7832,Got to love when the walleyes come out to play Great cleaning technique Randy    Butterflying'em is how I do it also Thanks for sharing Leechman
622278,Rod Caster,2011-09-17 12:52:00,5784,"way to go Wapa-Randy! Thems are some great keepers. I still filet around the rib cage. It takes a little more time/precision. With 9 keepers, your method you be much quicker!"
622279,Rattletrap2,2011-09-17 12:56:00,1652,"Very nice Randy! Pretty good fishing for only an hour! That is the way I have always cleaned my fish as well. I was taught by a relative of my Wife that lived in North Bay, but we were fishing at their camp on Temiskaming. It was one of those lessons that has stuck with me for many, many years.  What about the cheeks? Ya gotta get them too!"
