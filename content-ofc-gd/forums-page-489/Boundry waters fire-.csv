It sure looked strange with a guy holding a beautiful lake trout in his canoe with the blackened moonlike landscape behind him. I guess we can consider ourselves lucky that Algonquin has not suffered this fate in a very,very long time but i'm sure her day will come, just hope it's not in our life time !"
