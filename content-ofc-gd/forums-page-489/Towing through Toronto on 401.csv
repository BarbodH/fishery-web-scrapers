622321,SirWhite,2011-09-17 18:43:00,210,"  110% correct. The reason why traffic is so bad is because of all the ignorant drivers in the WRONG lanes. Its a butterfly effect which I see happen on a DAILY basis. This is a fact, watch and pay attention the next time your on ANY highway, one person in the wrong lane will end up making MULTIPLE drivers swerve to avoid or pass on either side making a wall of three cars momentarily and causing all cars in vacinity to react. The same as well for the second worse drivers the ones who sit in the passing lanes and aren't passing anyone, this means MOVE OVER. This theory is sound I see it every day and is the root of all the gridlock traffic, its not volume as some may think. Anyways sorry for the rant."

621866,smally21,2011-09-15 20:20:00,993,"they are not slow and fast lanes. the speed you are driving is irrelavant. they are DRIVING lanes and PASSING lanes. if you are being passed by traffic on the right you are in the wrong lane regardless of your speed. unless you are actively passing you belong in the far right or DRIVING/CURB lane.  slower moving traffic, no matter what the speedometer says is a huge impediment to traffic flow. it also forces a dangerous condition where oversize/commercial vehicles are forced all the way to the outside passing lanes to pass the slow moving vehicle in the middle. now all 3 lanes have slowed and no one can overtake. now a bunch of jockeys start doing double lane changes and passing on the inside. it is all related to the middle lane guy who thinks its safer to be in the middle.  think about it, you want to be safe? only have traffic on one side of you at a time and leave yourself 'an out' (ie the shoulder). this would leave the driving or curb lane as your safest lane. having traffic wizzing past you on both sides is hardly the safest conditon for you to be in.  if ya dont like it check the drivers handbook and the highway traffic act. they both address lane use and its never discussed what speed you are travelling, just fast and slow moving traffic.  of course at the 20km/hr toronto traffic moves, it really doesn't matter what lane you are in."

The rules of the road say you are to drive in the lane farthest to the right and then move to the left to pass. Can't do that on most 3 lane highways though because we have 10km long moving road blocks of people who think that they can turn their brains off because they are sitting in the middle lane.

622020,spincast,2011-09-16 09:28:00,3279,"Plan on leaving early or after supper. Between 7 and 9 and 3 and 6, not much point on trying to get through TO anywhere on the 401. If you've tried doing it often enough, you will know what I mean - ask a few of the transport drivers and regular commuters on the board.  not sure how close you like to follow the person in front usually, but try to double it. Even with a little boat you're stopping distance will be longer, and as Wayne and Paul mentioned - the guy behind you will ususally need more time than he has allowed too, so help him out.  Yes, cars will continue to take the opening, but it surprising how easy it is to maintain after a while.  As an interesting excercise if you get in one of those stop and go back ups - find one of the lane jumpers with an easily identifiable car - colour, roof rack, whatever. 9 times out of 10, when the road finallly clears, he'll be within 10 -15 car lengths.  As for those who don't understand the concept of lane dsicipline - the net effect of failing to abide by the keep right except to pass requirment of the HTA  reduces a 3 lane highway to a 2 lane highway and vauses congestion and accidents. It is not the safe lane as some mis-guided defensive driving organisiations identified it back in the 1970's -it is the middle passing lane and I wish the police would enforce the obstructing traffic charges that can and should be laid. Stating you can't change lanes due to merging and other traffic in the left lane is nothing other than justification for your unwillingness to drive properly.  I towed 48 and 53 foot of trailers through Toronto Montreal and other areas for years. Wayne is 100% correct about how effective lane discipline is at keeping traffic moving int he UK and Europe in general. Enforcing it here woudl go along way towards addressingour raod congestion and accident rate. Use da cruze and go with da flow.   "

I know , i just bought my first new truck last fall with all the toys , thease things were'nt my choice but i needed a truck right away to be able to keep moving my equipment and this is the only way they come now , no more bare bones as they dont make enough money selling that kind of stuff .  To me the thing is nothing but a death trap out on the road with all its buildt in features that try to distrac you from what you realy should be consendrating on , and that at all times should be the driving , some of us who can't let our selves be distracted know you can never take your eyes off the driving for a second .

Found recently that it burns a ton of gas stopping/starting through towns to get moving and adds at least an hour on the trip (barring no slowdowns on 401).
