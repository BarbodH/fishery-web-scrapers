621472,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-14 16:52:00,130," if there can be 37 posts on ""anyone else smell that..."" there can be 34 on a fish skinner or and 42 about a potato that looks like a rock."
621475,mike rousseau,2011-09-14 17:11:00,4661,I've never seen someone clean 100 perch with only a knife...  Most people use a skinner in my area cause your not cleaning 10 perch... It's more like 100...  What's your brothers name?
621556,Skipper D,2011-09-14 21:27:00,1970,"  And your the guy who came to read it , why do you do that to your self ........lol ."
621558,Skipper D,2011-09-14 21:34:00,1970,"  His name is Roger , newer burgandy colour ford pickup , 16'black and ? MirroCraft with 40 Yamaha , body man at the 11 street and Sidney st body shop ,"
621561,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-14 21:51:00,130,  I was defending the thread. At least I learned that if I catch 100 perch there will be a filleting alternative.
621625,Skipper D,2011-09-15 04:09:00,1970, i have more to learn..............
620960,Skipper D,2011-09-13 11:09:00,1970,"I'd say many of you have never seen one of thease and again many of you have , its just a tool that makes your life alot easyer put get this , this one in my picture that i use is about 35 years old and its time for a new one , so the other day i stoped in at Pro Bass and thats right , they don't have them , any know where you could buy one north of Toronto ? , i'd hate to have to drive to the Quebec boarder to get a nother one where i know they sell then off the shelve at the CTS over that way ...............Darn , i thought i uploaded a picture here , then just type in ""Townsend Fish Skinner"" on the net and a picture of one should show up if you'd like to see what i'am talkingabout , if you don't have one of thease am sure after seeing you will  ...........for know i better get to work ."
620981,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 12:20:00,130,"Is that the same thing this guy is using in his ""original"" way to fillet his fish? Fillet a fish? <-guy is from Quebec, coincidence? I think not.  I think the reason you can only find it in Quebec is that they have to do things different.  Why not leave a bit of the tail attached and run your knife along the underside of the skin when the skin is lying on the counter?"
621000,johnnyb,2011-09-13 12:52:00,3413,No use for those skinners whatsoever....if I see one I'll let you know though
621010,Roy,2011-09-13 13:04:00,13728," The correct way to write that would be ""to do things differently."" You're looking for an adverb here answering the question ""how"". The answer is ""differently"". Yes, we do things differently here.  Call Townsend Engineering in Iowa. They'll tell you where to buy one in your area."
621014,johnnyb,2011-09-13 13:07:00,3413,  
621016,mike rousseau,2011-09-13 13:14:00,4661,they stopped selling em in the cornwall area as well... good thing i have 3...  should last me my lifetime...
621018,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 13:20:00,130," haha...I was quoting the guy on you tube. Yes, he does things differently! At least you are propping up the Quebec brand. Do you know that guy?"
621037,Roy,2011-09-13 14:10:00,13728, I have no idea what you're <----(contraction) talking about.
621093,mercman,2011-09-13 17:05:00,7054,  I'm sure we know that guy. He lives accross the road in Scheffervile doesnt he?
621122,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-13 17:58:00,4399,"  I am sure you meant ""dat guy eh""!"
621155,Skipper D,2011-09-13 19:28:00,1970,"  musky Mike , my brother Baby La La lives in Cornwall and said he saw them still at CTS just the other day , was he seeing things ,  growing up in Cornwall my self i know thease skinners are awsome , any way do your know this brother of mine , lives just off the north end of McCONNEL in the back on Gerard street i think it is , like to fish for walleye when he's not polishing the boat ....................."
621160,Skipper D,2011-09-13 19:36:00,1970," But hey !  Thanks every one for the help , come hell or high water i'll find one and i'll be the fastest getting the skin off ............"
621161,Roy,2011-09-13 19:40:00,13728, But not quite as fast as someone with a good knife.
621162,Skipper D,2011-09-13 19:48:00,1970,"  I never saw it done with a knife Roy , we always had the skinner ,  i would like to see the knife thing tho , might change me for ever ,"
621163,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-13 19:50:00,130,If you keep talking about the fish skinner I am going to start thinking I need one when I know it is a useful as 1/2 the lures in my tackle bag!
621164,mercman,2011-09-13 19:55:00,7054,   Hey !!! I'm Henglish
621174,Skipper D,2011-09-13 20:12:00,1970, If you get one tell me where you got it OK ..........lol....lol .
621185,mercman,2011-09-13 20:52:00,7054,  I had one of those things years ago before i knew how to do it by hand.Manual is much faster with less scales flying all over the place.Never could get used to using the tool.
621281,mike rousseau,2011-09-14 00:18:00,4661,The skinners are handy for small walleye and perch...  I think it's cause if the perch in lake st Francis that made them popular in this area...
621324,Skipper D,2011-09-14 02:26:00,1970,"  This will should how old and how long some have been at it with this tool .....lol. , i first saw the TOWNSEND SKINNER in the mid sixty's , at that time i was driving and fishing the St Lawrence when perch fishing there was way better then it is now ."
621329,2jack2,2011-09-14 02:57:00,92," Bass Pro dont sell the TOWNSEND skinner but they do carry their own brand, same concept, a lot less money compare to the TOWNSEND."
621332,otter649,2011-09-14 03:03:00,118,Have you tried Ebay as they seem to carry alot of different items.......
621337,Skipper D,2011-09-14 03:12:00,1970," The only thing i saw on the shelve were those scaling knifes , did'nt see theirs , will have to take another look"
621338,Skipper D,2011-09-14 03:16:00,1970,"  ebay .... lol  , to complecated site for this old boy to be on ....."
621369,Billy Bob,2011-09-14 09:13:00,5865,24 posts on a skinning machine......skinning a fish is the easy part...my wife skins the fish.....if you can't skin a fish with a fillet knife then who the hell fillets the fish....
