Went down to the local river, 2nd cast bang, salmon on, 15 seconds salmon off.  Slurp of coffee, lets try this again, after 1/2 an hour, second hit, dang, not a good hook up, spit the lure back at me again.  Ah well had some action and fun.  Slurp some more coffee, as I climb the hill, I find the grass is frosted over and quite slippery.  Back home, now it's time to tackle the trailer and get it closed up for the cold months."
