620443,danbouck,2011-09-12 01:34:00,4380,"The weekend started on Friday with a friendly game of paintball with about 20 guys from work. It was my first time and I kicked some serious   Mind you by the end I was ready to pass out. I went through about 300 paintballs in the 6 games that we had and managed to only get hit once, not too bad if you ask me.    Saturday I was ripped off the couch by Jacob and forced to go fishing. We tried a few carp spots and got nothing, tried a few bass spots and got nothing. He wanted to try one more place before we went home and he managed a little WGSF to make sure we didn't get skunked.    After that we went out to the fall fair. The costs are getting ridiculous there. $35 to get in and $40 for enough tickets for 2 rides each      I only spent cash on one game because the carny said that it is very hard and he suggested not to waste the money on the kids trying it. Both kids got 7 out of 7 balls in   Got sweet Angry Bird stuffed animals out of it    The demolition derby was that night as well and it did not disappoint. The first round was a race with 2 jumps and a car flipped in under 2 minutes.          That night I decided that I was going to take him out in the boat Sunday. So this morning we set off for Long Point. They were calling for Thunderstorms in the afternoon but we got lucky and missed them (barely).  Jacob made the decision to go out to a spot about 10 miles from the boathouse. Since the lake was flat I agreed. By flat I mean like glass      We set off and got to the spot and started washing lures. Then we washed some more lures and more lures. I figured I wouldn't get anything because I was targeting Muskie out there which are not that common. The clouds were getting a little darker so we decided to troll back a bit before making the run back.      As we were heading back Jacob noticed a bunch of ""animals"" in the water. I went up to have a look and found a bunch of these floating around.      Kinda weird!  Anyway, we went to a perching spot where everyone else was fishing and bathed a minnow for 10 minutes before I decided to leave for my honey hole. It's a little early yet but I wanted to try it anyways, it did not disappoint. 2 hours of minnow in, fish out, minnow in, fish out. Jacob quit because he was too tired and I quit when I got my limit.    Dinner tomorrow night    We finished the day tailgating SRT8 and eating blueberry fritters. Time for bed!      Thanks for reading"

620464,Joey,2011-09-12 02:16:00,9122,Looks like a busy and fun weekend.   Were those birds in the water?
620474,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-12 02:38:00,2690,"Way to go Dan!!  Looks like a fun weekend all around.  Too bad we missed you out there today.  We did bump into Shawn (SRT8) as you know. Perch dinner for us tomorrow too, can't wait.  If I had to pick only one freshwater fish to eat perch would be it!  Hopefully see you out there next time!"
620477,limeyangler,2011-09-12 02:47:00,5204,good stuff Dan.  those birds in the water are weird...but cool.
620510,spincast,2011-09-12 09:37:00,3279,Great times with the family. WTG. Supper looks delish. Paris fair is cheaper than that - and bigger from what I remember when we llived in Cambridge - may want to try it next year? One of the first nights (Thursday I think?) they have a wristband policy - gets you all the rides for the price of admission. Of course Demo derby is on the last night so ya cant do both Wonder if the muskie we going to find those birds?

620996,jbailey,2011-09-13 12:48:00,866,"paintballing is great outdoors activity, not the greatest inside tho.  I was also out in Long Point Bay on Sunday, beautiful day but couldnt get into any fish except a small pike and a small largie"
621002,The Urban Fisherman,2011-09-13 12:53:00,2050," I'm insulted you guys were in my neighborhood and didn't stop in for a beer!  Good work on the perch though Frank!  Cheers, Ryan"
621013,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-13 13:07:00,2690," Funny, as we were passing by DC I mentioned to Juli that we still had to drop in and say hi, plus pick up one of the posters from the Fish-A-Thon.  If I make it down for a shot at some of those brownies, I'll let you know when. Maybe we can set up a perch fish with Dan and Shawn, be fun to get the four boats out there together."
621017,danbouck,2011-09-13 13:18:00,4380, Nice Try... You won't get my spots that easily  I thought about stopping in but after cleaning all those fish I needed to get home and go to bed lol
621023,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-13 13:36:00,2690,"  Why do I have visions of you in disguise, out on the water"

621559,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-09-14 21:34:00,1107,Hey why were you so far away when ya took the pic? I was just about to brake check the crazy guy tailgating me when I saw Dan hanging out the window waving   it was a nice day out on the water just wish the bass weren't getting a beat down all morning before I got out I think there was a tourney going on .I like Frankies floatilla Idea the perch will be in the bay till ice up now that it's cooled down or we could head to bluffs for Pike and ski's in Dan's and my boat should be getting really good out there soon.
