831121,miller,2014-01-18 01:57:00,223,Last I heard 8-10 inches
831245,Steve,2014-01-18 21:43:00,2075,any big browns for you so far this year miller?
831425,dave524,2014-01-19 14:07:00,4508,Is the marina at Fifty considered part of Lake Ontario for the regs or would it be inland closing on Sept 30th for trout?
831427,BillM,2014-01-19 14:16:00,17367,"Lake Ontario, zone 20."
831434,dave524,2014-01-19 14:35:00,4508,"Lake Ontario, zone 20.  I had always assumed that along with everyone else. But then I got to thinking it was a creek mouth that got turned into a harbour, other creek mouths along the south shore have specific extended seasons, some are also harbours too. There is no extended season listed for Fifty Creek like there is for there is for 40 ,20 ,16 and 12 Mile Creeks, so maybe not. Winter too much time to think"
831436,Fish Farmer,2014-01-19 14:39:00,2234,It's classed as FMZ 20 North side of the QEW lake Ont. Just getting into the truck as I type goin fishin at 50 Pt. for a few hours.
831457,miller,2014-01-19 16:44:00,223,Biggest this fall was around 17lbs. Plenty of em though.
831484,Steve,2014-01-19 19:17:00,2075,atta boy!
831499,Burtess,2014-01-19 20:19:00,901,"No fish for us today, ice was 10"" anyway.  Be careful at the far east side of the marina as there is some pull away of ice  from the wall.  I went through on the way out in about 7 foot of water, wet up to my waist.  We put a post in it to mark it.  Nice to meet Fish Farmer as we were leaving, he went through the ice in the same area.  Burt"
831558,Fish Farmer,2014-01-20 01:24:00,2234,"Nice to meet you Burt, Man that happened so fast, I was in the water before I had a chance. Felt stupid as I looked around hoping nobody saw me My buddy had quite a laugh. Took my boot off in my clam and put my foot over the Mr heater, talk about steam."
