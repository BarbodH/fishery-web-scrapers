830192,Ice Fishing Ham,2014-01-13 16:05:00,83,In the past during the week I have rented huts from Floyd Hales in Beaverton. Also from Ice Fishing Outfitters at Virginia Beach.

My buddies keep flopping..and would be nice to just go alone..but prefer to be in a warm hut. However, most operators have a min person charge! Sucks but I understand why   I was just thinking the same thing this morning.  Its not always easy to find people you want to spend 8 hours with in a small hut.  Maybe if you can go during the week, and if they have availability...they will let you rent one solo?  When I find a place I will let you know"
830197,NightCrawler,2014-01-13 16:40:00,15,IFH I will contact them this week. Hopefully they can hook me up.. Pun intended Thanks steel.. Please do and likewise with me!

830259,bobogo,2014-01-13 21:32:00,76,try dave's fish huts. They operate more than a dozen huts and I doubt they're all filled at any given time. They charge $45 per person. That easily covers the ride out and a bucket of minnows. They really chills so I think it shouldn't be a problem if you want to go solo.  I hear you when you say buddy always flopping. Hard to find a few friends that love fishing as much as we do.

830776,Rich,2014-01-15 22:13:00,3927,The guys (well one outfitter that I know of for sure) on LPB do it on weekdays.. im sure most up there would be somewhat more willing on weekdays as well.
