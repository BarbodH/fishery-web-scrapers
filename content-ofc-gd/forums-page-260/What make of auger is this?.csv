829694,nancur373,2014-01-10 05:18:00,1211,This is my auger. Bought it at a garage sale about 5 years ago for 50 cents believe it or not. Put a new set of blades on back then and it still cuts like a dream. (don't get out much ) The plastic wing nut has  split and I would like to try and find a replacement. There are no markings on it. Thanks  newf   
829695,hockeyplayerz_14,2014-01-10 05:24:00,160,i believe its a Swede bore made by normark
829696,chefboi17,2014-01-10 05:26:00,128,"Looks almost identical to this very old finbore i have, if it is marked the same way it was molded i to the grips. The replaceable blades are different though. On mine its a solid cutting head"
829726,manitoubass2,2014-01-10 13:57:00,11391,Hard to tell but it looks exactly like my swedebore. Maybe get a good close up and ill see if mine matches. Im sure it wouldnt cost much for me to ship ya a wing nut. Or maybe check your local hardware store?
829731,BillM,2014-01-10 14:29:00,17367,"Swede-bore doesn't have an offset handle, the Fin-bore does (like in the pic above).   Although the colour is the same as the Swede-bore (Light blue) compared to the dark blue of the Fin-Bore, lol.  I'm guessing this is an older Fin-bore model."

829767,Tybo,2014-01-10 17:46:00,1373,That is a Nils auger.They are quit expensive today.
829775,Spiel,2014-01-10 18:41:00,9065,"I have the exact auger, had it for over 30 years now.  It's a 7"" Normark Fin-Bore III  As for your wing nut issue, have you considered swapping it out for a steel one?"
829845,nancur373,2014-01-11 00:10:00,1211,Lots of opinions lol. I might try the steel nut
829846,misfish,2014-01-11 00:18:00,29133,"That is a Nils auger.They are quit expensive today.  Paul,if it,s an old Nils,it wouldnt have replaceable blades. Their blades were forged and sharpen from one peice. Just like the ones they sell now."
829848,misfish,2014-01-11 00:20:00,29133,"Check at Princess Auto, they have a variety of big plastic threaded knobs that might do the trick.  Yup"
829886,GoneFishin,2014-01-11 03:18:00,349,"Any hardware store will cary wing nuts. Have a look around I'm sure you will find something,"
829909,mike rousseau,2014-01-11 11:38:00,4661,Some were replaceable...  His look to be... You can see the bolts holding the blades on the end piece....  Mine were replaceable....
829916,Spiel,2014-01-11 14:37:00,9065,Here's a few pictures of mine from this morning showing the markings. It was purchased in the late 80's and still has the original blades.  Though if anyone knows where I can find new ones (blades)  I'd appreciate it.          
830153,nancur373,2014-01-13 04:01:00,1211,"Spiel. It does look identical. Although mine doesn't have the markings on it, probably worn off. I bought blades for it when I was a noob to ice fishing. It's actually got 8"" blades on it and cuts like a dream. I believe I bought them at CT. Don't quote me on that though...   Here is a pic of the blades.  "

I know of a few blade models that will fit unfortunately none are 7"" which is of course what I desire. 8"" will work (6"" won't). Perhaps buying the 8"" and machining them down will be my only option.   The search continues."

When I read it I thought you meant it applied to all Swede-bores, but I guess you just meant the Normark ones. C. Tire sells augers marked as Swede-bore but they have offset handles."
