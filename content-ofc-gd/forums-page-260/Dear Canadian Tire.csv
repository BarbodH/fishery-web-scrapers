Canadian Tire has never manufactured anything and has never owned a manufacturer who supplies on their behalf.  The corporation is a wholesaler who sells exclusively to franchised stores.  That means all products are purchased from parties not affiliated with Canadian Tire in any legal way.  Like most other large retailers, they hold ownership of private brands and has third party vendors manufacture to certain quality standards.  Take a look at any of their annual reports...in it you will find sales and revenue from retail operations, petroleum sites, financial services as well as other retailers they have purchased (Mark's Work Wearhouse, Forzani Group etc)...but that's it.

What I have learned is what the store policy is for each item. Like buying a $400.00 shallow well pump and brought it back to CTC the same day because it did not work, the motor was poached to be told that I needed to send it back to the manufacturer. I learned that day Mastercraft is not CTC anymore, it's an independent supplier !!!! IT must be true an 18 year old told me.It weighed around 25 pounds. Come on man, where's the store manager, not the acting manager the one that's picture is on the wall. She's off today, call her at home and get her in here because I'm not leaving until you call the OPP and I'll tell them why I'm not leaving. And who's going to pay the plumbers bill for install and removal?  Please give me the receipt Sir.  My wife buys me a ridiculously expensive watch from Facets Jewelers in Caledonia because I buy a $10.00 watch every year whether I need one or not. The stem breaks the second time I use it. Facets says they aren't a Fossil dealer and I need to send it to Texas for warranty work, shipping and insurance is on me. A year latter I get my watch back because it happened twice. Oh or I can drive 2 hours one way to some mall in TO and pick out a new watch, but the replacement is only the price of the same watch in the US and US funds, 40% less than the original was. So she spends $300.00 bucks and Fossil offers me $180.00 credit.  I buy a Okuma trolling rod and reel at Caledonia Bait and Tackle. The first fish on is lost. Reel in the line and the knot at the connection of the lead core and flouro has let go. Along with the $12.00 Reef Runner I bought there along with the other $50.00 I spent and Featherstone Ted bought $75.00 worth of tackle. She tells me it's not her problem talk to Okuma here's their number. Are you kidding me, you are going to loose a first time customer over a lure you paid maybe $5.00 for wholesale? I guess so. Anyone from Caledonia listening?  Find out the return policy before putting out a dime.  I think that's one reason why many boxes are open at CTC that are on the shelf.  I'm done ranting sorry."

I have been to Canadian Tires in Quebec, Alberta and all over Ontario, Including all of the Mississauga locations and this one takes a cake, so here is my story about the heartland location.  A few years (2007 or 2008) back my parents bought brand new winter tire for their car. Three of which in the first two weeks had to be replaced because they weren't installed properly or maybe a bad batch.  When we brought the car back after one of the tires needed replacing the service manager. Was telling other costumers including us how busy they were.  He proceed to tell us of another person that had their car in the shop and he was laughing at why it was in the shop there. He told us that it was there because the person's wheel feel off their car going down the highway and he was laughing about it.  Since this my family and I have tried to avoid going back to this location, because of this one staff member and manager at that. My parents also filed a complaint against the shop manager.  So in short you might understand why such a sign is up at this location is up, they clearly do not care about costumer service there."

It failed this past month and despite ct being the only retailer for master craft batteries, they refused to take it back without a receipt.  I even suggested they prorate me to the date of manufacture....seemed reasonable.  Still no go.  CT is a terrible retailer.  I really wish a US competitor would establish a similar store with better customer service practices that don't seem to make the consumer feel as though they are always on the defensive or make them want to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do like trying to even the score. Real pity because I love their sales.   If a US competitor does set up shop and is more consumer friendly, CT better watch out.  That would be a good time to short CT stock. That would be a good way to 'even' the score.  As for admitting to fraud and being charged, the police would never pursue this.  Look at rob ford.  Admitted to possessing and smoking crack, caught peeing in public,  etc....and still no charges."
