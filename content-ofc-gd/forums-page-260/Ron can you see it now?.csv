830472,Handlebarz,2014-01-14 18:45:00,3790,Thanks guys I know I have shares Ron and my pics before from that day but this was way cool to have it show up on musky hunter. Next I can't wait to see John fishing on the show.
830482,Spiel,2014-01-14 19:20:00,9065,"Ahhhhh, so this is what Ron was talking about yesterday. Perhaps I should listen to him more closely....  Nicely done guys, I do remember the report."
830536,Ron,2014-01-14 23:28:00,1683,"This was really cool Mike. I didn't know what you were up to when you started to ask me questions like address and such. It was definitely a nice surprise when I saw it on the Musky Hunter show. Like you said, couldn't think of a better person to share a double header, almost a triple, with! Both are respectable fish to boot!   Looking forward to see what we can do to top that!  Cheers, Ron..."
830544,houski,2014-01-14 23:57:00,61,That's awesome guys. I saw that Saturday morning. Hell of a show to boot! Lots of big girls in that one!
830547,Locnar,2014-01-15 00:15:00,645,Badass! Thems some big ol' skis.
830567,cowanjo,2014-01-15 01:37:00,249,Absolutely awesome mike _ you will have to get the whole season you never know you might see a handlebarz in one
830587,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-15 02:28:00,8243,Mike you show them Yanks how it's done up here. Way to go man.
830619,Joey,2014-01-15 03:53:00,9122,Way to go boys!!!  Awesome
830848,Handlebarz,2014-01-16 01:40:00,3790,"Ron I can't wait for this year maybe we will be nice and let Keith and Danna get them lol. NOT  John I hope they have some in the show that would be great. I can't wait for this summer.  Thanks everyone Ron and I have been enjoying that day since it happened. Like Ron said it was almost a triple header all over 50"" all on Handlebarz that would have been just sick. I think we are lucky it did not happen as danna would have kicked us all into your boat."
