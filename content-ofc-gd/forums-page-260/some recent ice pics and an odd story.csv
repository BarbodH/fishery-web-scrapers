830252,chris.brock,2014-01-13 21:08:00,4053,"took the ""slush buggy"" out to the hut    I planned on staying past dark to see if the ling would cooperate so I lit the red neck woodstove    a couple lakers before dark    a ciscoe too     all fish released    playing video games like Brian    after dark, I had fish regularly chasing the glo spoon, with minimal contact, I'm assuming these were ling, I tried a live minnow too but no takers  any ideas or input?  I guess they could have just been not very active?  they totally stopped coming around about 1.5 hours after dark, and I didn't mark a single fish     interesting story-  A cottage neighbor puts his hut out last weekend, lights his stove to warm the place, locks the door and goes to town for minnows. He had a 2 burner stove, he assumes 1 burner was lit, the other burner was on but not lit, just spewing propane.   BOOM!  Somebody heard the blast and saw the fire, they assumed someone was in there, the OPP and the CO soon showed up  I was hoping to get a picture for you guys but he brought whats left of the hut home to see if he can repair it"
830253,kickingfrog,2014-01-13 21:17:00,8333,"Nice lakers and whitefish. Ling have always been an incidental catch for me, so no help there. Scary about the hut."
830256,misfish,2014-01-13 21:29:00,29133,   Wow one lucky fella that was.  Scary crap.  Nice fish and how did you know that tank was empty before you cut it? Is there a pipe on top?
830258,solopaddler,2014-01-13 21:31:00,8605,"Slush doesn't look too brutal, nice fish bud.  Crazy story about your neighbours hut, wow."
830270,irishfield,2014-01-13 22:05:00,26272,Nice fish Chris! Why I shudder every time I see the red safety light button taped down on the sunflower burners because the thermo is toast. It's there for a reason...  He may have lite both burners.. and one went out on the close of the door.
830272,chris.brock,2014-01-13 22:09:00,4053,   Wow one lucky fella that was.  Scary crap.  Nice fish and how did you know that tank was empty before you cut it? Is there a pipe on top?  I filled the tank with water first  here's a pic showing the pipe  
830273,SirCranksalot,2014-01-13 22:12:00,3291,I guess if he stuck around he would have smelled the propane and taken care of the situation.
830276,Rustic-Fisher,2014-01-13 22:15:00,826,"Nice pics ! Chum with Salted minnows ,  then slip a couple salties on a hook and it should be ling after ling."
830278,lew,2014-01-13 22:16:00,12766,Shows just how easily a fun day can sometimes turn nasty.  Good to hear your bud was away from the hut when she blew Chris.
830281,iFish4real,2014-01-13 22:25:00,386,"sorry for the dude but kinda strange...if burners are close, the one that's out would lit from the one burning, I've seen that on BBQs, his burnurs must have been far from each other..."
830282,misfish,2014-01-13 22:29:00,29133," I filled the tank with water first  here's a pic showing the pipe     You can use that as a hunting shack too.LOL  Thanks for the reply Chris. And yes,the video game is fun,but can be frustrating.LOL"
830350,Beans,2014-01-14 01:56:00,3339,Reminds me of a time back in the late '60s...a couple of guys asked us to keep an eye on their tent out on Lady Simcoe while they took their morning catch in to the local grocery store to sell...$0.45 a lb. for whitefish and $0.39 a lb for herring (the 2 lb size -sand herring?)  We heard a loud bang and when we looked there was steam pouring from the tent...seems they left a tin of Habitant vegetable soup (unopened) on the stove...looked like someone had barfed all over the inside...LOL
830352,livinisfishin,2014-01-14 02:10:00,661,Looks like it was a good way to spend an evening. Im going to try a night session soon. That is scary about your neighbour..guess thats why the instructions say something about not leaving it unattended and lit. Very lucky !  Was it a coleman style  2 burner?
830354,chris.brock,2014-01-14 02:25:00,4053,"  yeah, coleman style 2 burner, the burners are fairly far apart, there was some air drafting in because he hadn't yet piled snow along the bottom of the hut, I'll try to get a picture of the damage up later"
830356,livinisfishin,2014-01-14 02:36:00,661,I forgot to ask in my first post..do you use a pink and white cyclops often? Pretty good success usually?
830371,Sinker,2014-01-14 03:12:00,8692,Crazy about buddies hut....I prefer a woodstove to gas anyday!  Nice fish!  S.
831138,Tim Mills,2014-01-18 02:42:00,476,"Nice report glad your neighbour wasn't "" blowed up real good"""
831143,EC1,2014-01-18 03:35:00,930,"Hopefully your neighbor gets the hut back in working order before the ice melts!  Had a trip of trying to chase ling myself this week, and failed miserably as well! I was able to catch a few lake trout well past dark - that was a first for me. They lazily came in and nipped at my glow spoon. I thought for sure those were ling until I reeled them up and heard the burping. Let's compare notes over a couple of PM's about how you find the ling nearing the end of the season!"
831162,wormdunker,2014-01-18 10:55:00,1711,"Scary stuff about the hut exploding.  I recently read a post about carbon monoxide.  Glad I purchased the ""Buddy"" heater because of the built in safety devices."
831185,SirCranksalot,2014-01-18 16:19:00,3291,"    aaah, redneck heaven!!"
