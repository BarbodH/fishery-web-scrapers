831022,NAW,2014-01-17 13:40:00,4022,I briefly heard about a rescue on Simcoe last night.  But I didn't catch the details. Supposedly it was dramatic...  Anyone know what happened?
831023,HTHM,2014-01-17 13:46:00,4082,A 14 year old boy went out ill prepared and used his cell phone to call for help. Here is a link:  http://www.torontosun.com/2014/01/16/teen-rescued-from-lake-simcoe
831024,lew,2014-01-17 13:50:00,12766,"Saw that on the news last night, musta been terrifying for a young kid."
831025,Terry,2014-01-17 13:51:00,14456,"he was not an ice fisherperson  he did not go through the ice  he just got lost, cold and scared  he had a cell phone he got the day before and his parents did not know he had bought one...  glad it all worked out"
831027,NAW,2014-01-17 14:01:00,4022,Crazy...  The kid is lucky to be alive.  He's going to think twice before he does that again.  Kind of unbeleivable though.  No hat or mitts?  A 14 yo should know better.  Fox island is a long walk if he came from IBP...
831029,Acountdeleted,2014-01-17 14:25:00,2562,"Young male on lake Simcoe for hours..... I thought this article was going to be about Chris K.  'When found the young man exclaimed ""just one more lake trout. Then I'll call it a night""'  In all seriousness though, I'm glad the kid is ok. In the dark on the ice everything looks the same."

831034,Acountdeleted,2014-01-17 15:47:00,2562,Btw Chris K clean out your inbox. I've been trying to message you. Hopefully the full inbox means your fly tying business is going well.
831035,lew,2014-01-17 15:58:00,12766,"I did some dumbass stuff at 14 as well, glad he got home.  Yeah, didn't we all Bill and I don't think this kid did any worse than most 14 year old boys did...including me.  If kids aren't living dangerously, they aren't having any fun."
831060,davey buoy,2014-01-17 20:12:00,5505," Yeah, didn't we all Bill and I don't think this kid did any worse than most 14 year old boys did...including me.
