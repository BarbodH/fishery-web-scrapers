So naturally I thought maybe I would bring the boat and possibly slide a little muskie fishing into my down time. I'm not in the party(thank you son!), so I should be able to arrange for a day on the water.  I'm looking for any tips for a July Muskie day, locations, hot spots, trolling, casting, Launches (with parking).  Or if Kingston isn't the best place to get on the water, possibly a neighbouring town?  Thanks !  Chris"
