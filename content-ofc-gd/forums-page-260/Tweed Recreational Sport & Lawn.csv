830611,leafs4ever,2014-01-15 03:09:00,6,Has anyone purchased a boat from Tweed RS&L?  Just wondering how they are to deal with as I am thinking of purchasing a boat. Thank you.

I did not end up buying from Tweed RS&L but I would like to comment they were very good to work with and I really liked Kirk Boldrick (owner). He was very patient and a real down to earth guy. I ended with a different brand of boat.
