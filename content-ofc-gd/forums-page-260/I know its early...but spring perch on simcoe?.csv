831207,Fisherman,2014-01-18 19:20:00,7201,"Couple weeks before ice out to a couple weeks after, then they cruise off for deeper water.  Sometimes you get lucky at the Orillia Derby, but that's been hit and miss the last couple of years."
831215,sneak_e_pete,2014-01-18 19:42:00,540,Thanks...when is ice out usually?  Wanting to target by boat
