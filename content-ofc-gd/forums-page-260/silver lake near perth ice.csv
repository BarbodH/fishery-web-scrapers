I would like to know what the ice thickness is and is there any areas to avoid seeing how ive never steped foot out there ever. If you have some good areas that are hot I wouldnt mind that info either."
830681,Freshtrax,2014-01-15 16:30:00,2215,Lots of ice I was out before New Years on 8 inches of ice.
830686,irishfield,2014-01-15 16:44:00,26272,Don't go anywhere on the ice near the hwy and junction of the SW corner of the PPark by the old gas station...  No issues walking out from the public picnic area... to past the church owed island and into the deep laker grounds.
830728,keeganjohnson,2014-01-15 19:21:00,4,Thanks alot guys. I was going to get on the lake at the area just inland of the island and walk out from there. Would you recomend fishing the middle where its deepest for the lake trout
830748,irishfield,2014-01-15 21:08:00,26272,"See if they plowed the picnic area and walk out from there. If you want lakers.. then you're going to need to get past the island, you just need to be on the North side of it to find 40+ feet of water. You may find the lakers in the deep hole.. or they could be up on the edges and humps feeding, you never know until you try!"
830888,keeganjohnson,2014-01-16 11:52:00,4,Are you saying the picnic area in the park because I was looking at the maps and it shows an area that looks like an access to the lake just off the highway 7 just inland the island. Is that the picnic area or are we talking about in the park. And im also sorry about all these questions just never been to this lake before and want to have a good experience on it .
830893,Acountdeleted,2014-01-16 13:32:00,2562,Those crazy lake trout. Never know what they'll get up to next.
