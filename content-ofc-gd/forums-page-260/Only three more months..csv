830509,Bernie,2014-01-14 21:06:00,3190,"Winter is getting to me, but only just a little to this point.Thoughts like this is worth the anticipation.    But before that happens, looking forward to a little of this with the fellas. This is only a little over a  month away.        Geez, can you tell it's quiet in my shop today? I hate the January slump....."
830513,lew,2014-01-14 21:21:00,12766,"Summers better than winter Bernie, for just about every reason"
830515,irishfield,2014-01-14 21:25:00,26272,Maybe you can get a wide angle lense Bernie.. so we can fish further apart next time! lol
830516,Bernie,2014-01-14 21:38:00,3190,My guess is that someone caught a fish in that spot. I think it was you.
830517,misfish,2014-01-14 21:45:00,29133,Talk about being greased out of a spot. Thats why you have to have a shelter.LOL  That first pics sure looks nice though.
830543,Headhunter,2014-01-14 23:57:00,5703,"  Pretty hard to rib each other all day, when they're 50 yards away! The back and forth is almost as much fun as the catchin! Thanks for the pics Bernie! HH"
830615,Christopheraaron,2014-01-15 03:22:00,3525,"Geez, that's the best you can do! LOL    Second walleye I've ever caught, over 20"", go figure eh?  "
830620,Bernie,2014-01-15 04:00:00,3190,"Chris, it takes a lot of skill to catch them that small. Seriously, how did he even know it was on the hook?"
830622,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-15 04:28:00,10439,"Yep, another 6 months and I'll be out in the boat again!!!!"
830625,Headhunter,2014-01-15 04:45:00,5703,  HH
830630,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-15 05:01:00,8243,That Walleye look too skinny to you guys considering it's length?  Must have been starving or what?
830637,Nipfisher,2014-01-15 05:26:00,2449,"Bernie, PM me when the guys come up and I will try and visit. Been trying to meet up with you guys for a couple years now. Blair"
830647,ccmtcanada,2014-01-15 13:29:00,7971,I've had enough of winter too!!  Can't wait to get there next month Bernie!
830655,Sinker,2014-01-15 14:15:00,8692,"3 months? Your dreaming! I'll still be drilling holes in 3 months, for sure, and you will probably be drilling for longer than we will down here!  That's barely enough time to get all my ice fishing done!! I better get moving LOL  S."
830693,easytalknguy,2014-01-15 17:01:00,7,"Well if I remembered, Will to moved me over to my surprise and got skunked !! Great laughers on a nice day of fishing Maybe it can be another day of another nice Nipising gold, and a blue from Joe"
830698,Headhunter,2014-01-15 17:30:00,5703,"LOL. I had completely forgot about that! FnS greased him out while he was getting bait, after he had caught some nice slot fish. FnS got skunked! LOL HH"
830704,Bernie,2014-01-15 17:53:00,3190,"Sinker, the latest it has been to get across to the cottage by boat in the last ten years was April 22nd of last year. The earliest was March 30th two years ago. Half way through January, three months puts it to April 15th. An average."
830746,irishfield,2014-01-15 21:06:00,26272,As long as I caught first fish is all that matters! The laughter just helps with the grease out...
830749,fishnsled,2014-01-15 21:09:00,3520,"I'll take the winter months for now and if need be, take Rubin's spot again, not that it mattered that day.....I sucked!    LOL!!"
830752,irishfield,2014-01-15 21:13:00,26272,Rubin probably didn't notice Will... he's only getting intel for the memory...
