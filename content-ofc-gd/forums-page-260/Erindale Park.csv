I havent fished it in eons however, but when we where young and stupid, and not old enough for a drivers license we used to go to erindale by train and bus to get a winter fix.  Some of the faster sections would stay open in all but the coldest winters.  I wouldn't say them fishing was great though.... LOL.  Good luck!"
831279,salmon,2014-01-18 23:22:00,334,Several days ago the water was high and dirty. This was early this week. There is always open water at the Credit

831350,fishing n autograph,2014-01-19 03:09:00,2540,Cool thanks. I had an office at burnhamthorpe and credit view so I was at the park almost daily but since I switched jobs in 2006 I'm never in that area anymore
