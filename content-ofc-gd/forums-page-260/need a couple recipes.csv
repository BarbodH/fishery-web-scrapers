830924,jbailey,2014-01-16 17:02:00,866,"Deep frying a herring is like eating a slimy dishcloth. Gotta smoke 'em herring is gross in general, for the whitefish! or stuff the whitefish with a crab cream cheese mix"
830939,Beans,2014-01-16 19:30:00,3339,"Whitefish a la Beans  Scale, gut, remove gills, (head on/off, your choice) score the body on both sides (about 1/2 inch deep cuts) lay on foil wrap sprayed with PAM...  In a bowl mix:  1 tbs minced or finely chopped fresh garlic 1 tbs minced or finely chopped fresh ginger 2 tbs soy sauce 2 tbs oyster flavoured sauce 1/2 tsp Chinese five spices 1 or 2 tbs peanut or vegetable oil a splash of white table wine a dash of sriracha hot sauce (optional)  Put the Foil/fish in a baking dish and spread the above mixture over the fish...Wrap the foil around the fish and bake or BBQ in a hot oven 400 * F for about 25 minutes...check for doneness (it flakes easily using a fork) giving it more time if needed...  Spread some chopped green onion and sprinkle some sesame oil over fish then serve with hot cooked rice and veggie of your choice...I likes it with bok choy or snow peas or green peppers...  If you are concerned about the bones...this works well with fillets..."
830941,Sinker,2014-01-16 19:59:00,8692,"Whities: Fillet them, trim off as much of the ""mud line"" and fat as you can, then fillet, the fillets, so they are nice and thin. Put meat in iced water. Start heating oil, and make batter.  Batter: 1 cup flour, 1 egg, 2 tsp baking powder. Add beer until batter is thin enough that it just coats the meat after rolling in flour. (you can substitute the flour for whatever you like, some like bisquick, some like different types of flour etc)  Get oil hot, dust meat in oil, roll thru batter and fry. Season to your taste.   DELISH!!  I find whities are best cooked fresh. I don't freeze them. I will even go as far as putting them on a fish chain and keeping them alive on the ice rather than let them freeze out there. It makes a big difference. So does putting the fresh cleaned fish in the iced water. Keep them COLD, and I mean as close to frozen, but not frozen.  The herring, I'd release. The only way I like them is pickled, or smoked whole in a proper smoker.  S."

830792,Christopheraaron,2014-01-15 22:47:00,3525,"Got my first couple whitefish the other day as well as some giant (4lb range) cisco, now have to cook em up.  The the whitefish I wanted to to broil them, usually I just use lemon, parsley, salt, and pepper but kind of wanted to try something new, suggestions?  For the herring I wanted to try smoking them (on the BBQ) I've never smoked anything on a BBQ so if anyone has any tips (and recipes  ) for that as well it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Chris."
830794,Joeytier,2014-01-15 22:52:00,3990,"I like to pan fry my whitefish in a small dollop of butter and a light coatin of italian bread crumbs.  Can't help ya with the herring, just don't fry it...gross."
830796,Christopheraaron,2014-01-15 22:55:00,3525,"Thanks Joey, I heard that fried tulibee is pretty gross  BTW, if anyone is wondering the herring was caught on nipissing."
830797,Joeytier,2014-01-15 22:56:00,3990,"If you dont feel like cooking it, chunk it up and save it for catfish and lakers"
830798,misfish,2014-01-15 22:57:00,29133,"Just add some fresh dill weed.to those lemons slices.  If you want a nice hearty piece of fish,put your fillets in a nice ice bath. The meat will plump up nice.. Put some budda on the foil. Lay the fillet on that,add lemon slices,dill and season to taste. My god, my mouth is watering. Im haveing  home made skettie and chicken parma. Not a bad sub in my books.LOL"
830799,misfish,2014-01-15 23:00:00,29133,"As for the herring? You would have to be here in person. I just used the oven and it worked fine. SMOKE FLAVOR,BUT NICE AND DRY. LOL"
830805,chris.brock,2014-01-15 23:32:00,4053,"I googled it, Ontario record cisco is 4.33lbs,  do you have any pics of yours?"
830807,bigugli,2014-01-15 23:42:00,6138,"For whitefish, scale and gut it. Make a standard poultry stuffing and add shrimp or crab, fill the cavity.  Spice the outside with salt, pepper, parsley and sage rub with butter and drizzle with lemon juice. Wrap in tinfoil and bake in oven"
830808,irishfield,2014-01-15 23:44:00,26272,Lake herring... I just filleted the one I got a year or two back and battered and deep fried it. Tasted no different than walleye... in TJ''s secret batter!
830813,Big Cliff,2014-01-16 00:00:00,6899,"For whitefish, scale and gut it. Make a standard poultry stuffing and add shrimp or crab, fill the cavity.  Spice the outside with salt, pepper, parsley and sage rub with butter and drizzle with lemon juice. Wrap in tinfoil and bake in oven Then throw out the fish and eat the stuffing!   I am just kidding LOL. Whitefish just like most other fish will depend on how you handle it after being caught. Keep it cold, keep it clean, and it will be fine. But, you can always make fish cakes or smoke it!"
830814,irishfield,2014-01-16 00:03:00,26272,"Cut it's throat and bleed it out right there on the ice.. step one... cut all the ""dark"" blood line and fat off during the fillet.. step two. Cook like any other fish after that and it tastes great."
830822,Christopheraaron,2014-01-16 00:30:00,3525,"I googled it, Ontario record cisco is 4.33lbs,  do you have any pics of yours? My buddy actually caught it but let me have it to try. Here's a pic, one of the locals we were fishing with said they regularly get to 5lbs, and I don't doubt it for a second, there was open water nearby with a school of them in it and you could see they were BIG fish.   "
830823,Christopheraaron,2014-01-16 00:31:00,3525,Looking back at them they're probably more like 3 lbers
830825,Joeytier,2014-01-16 00:34:00,3990,"I've never scaled any of mine, but they seem to be deceptively light fish.  I think a record cisco is likely a lot bigger than you might expect it to be.  Tough to find a better lake than nipissing for big cisco though...nasty buggers"
830828,irishfield,2014-01-16 00:40:00,26272,"Surprised that 4.33lbs is the record.. thought it would be a bit higher. I've caught 18"" 'rs on GBay and close to 21's on Temagami but never bothered to weigh them."
830837,chris.brock,2014-01-16 00:58:00,4053," let us know your opinion on how they taste, I haven't tried one yet"
830861,Freshtrax,2014-01-16 02:09:00,2215,The reccord is swimming in simcoe.  If defiantly seen some bigger than 4.3 Dow the hole when the school swims by.
830873,Joey,2014-01-16 02:59:00,9122,"I caught a bunch of herring in Temagami one year and brought them home and my mom and I spend a night making pickled herring and jarred them all up.  They were delicious.  You can buy them in the store first to see if you like them.  They sell them in jars or if you go to specialty shops, they sell them fresh."

830898,DanD,2014-01-16 14:12:00,2223,"I would try a dry brine on them; it'll draw some of the heavy oils out before smoking them. 1 cup of course salt, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, crushed pepper corns, onion & garlic power to taste. Wash and pat fillets dry, then in a plastic or glass resealable container add all ingredients and mix. Now rub the brine all over the fillets; then cover fillet with remaining brine. Seal the lid on the container and place in the fridge for 8-10 hours. Don't use a metal pot for this; the brine could draw toxins out of aluminium or give the fillets a tinny taste from steel. You could line either with a food grade plastic bag. When you take them out of the fridge, you'll be surprised at how much liquid has formed. Wash the fillets in clean cold water and place on a drying rack and let stand for 5-6 hours, in a cool room not the fridge. During the drying time a sticky film will develop on the fillets and that's a good thing. It will allow the smoke to adhere and penetrate the meat better. Now you're ready to get smoken. Use some type of fruit wood, they're not as harsh as hickory or some of the other woods. Only use one of the BBQ's burners (assuming your's has two); wood on direct heat, fish on in-direct heat. Get the BBQ heat up to around 200 degrees and then place your wood in. Once it starts to smoke place the fillets in; if they still have it, skin side down. Now the hard part, don't open the BBQ for at least 3/4's to an hour; just try and keep the heat around the 200 mark. The only time you need to open the BBQ is to add some wood chips or take the internal temp of the fish. When the fillet's internal temp is 140 to 150 they're done; any hotter and the meat will be dry. You could also sprinkle a bit of orange and or lemon juice on the fillets before they go in the BBQ, along with your favorite spices. If you're worried about or don't like a lot of salt you could soak the fillets in cold water for an hour before you place them out on a rack for drying.  Forgot to add; you should also put a pan of water, juice (Apple orange whatever) or your favorite beer in the BBQ while you're smoking; it'll add a bit of flavor and moisture.  Good luck and have fun.  Dan."
