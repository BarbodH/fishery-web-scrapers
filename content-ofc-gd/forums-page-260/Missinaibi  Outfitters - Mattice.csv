830966,chris.brock,2014-01-16 22:02:00,4053,"I've used Owen before for canoe trip and other stuff but not fishing  Where were you thinking of fishing, from the base camp or the Mons Lk outpost?"
831103,wantabigone,2014-01-18 01:03:00,97,"Mons lake outpost. After speaking to the outfitter I will pass on this idea. He mentioned that we should expect no problem catching our limit of walleye. There are many other locations where we should expect to exceed our daily limit. We would release all fish except the ones we eat, we just would prefer to get into numbers not ""work"" to get our limit.  I will keep searching, it's part of the fun."
