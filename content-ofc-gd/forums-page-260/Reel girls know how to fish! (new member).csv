830811,Handlebarz,2014-01-15 23:50:00,3790,Your right look at the three new guys I guess they are not steel headers lol. I guess we have a bunch of single guys here fishing is right.  As Joey said most are harmless. If your at the sportsman show on musky Sunday stop by the musky Canada area you can chat with my wife she is a fishing freak also. Not alot of girls posting anymore my wife was as were a bunch of others but they seem to marry off and leave with members from the board lol.

830465,moxie,2014-01-14 18:18:00,1566,Welcome to the board SB. Fished creeks and rivers east of the GTA a quarter century ago when tree canopied waters ran cold and the fish were plentiful and it still took me almost full fall and spring cycles to land my first Bow. Years afterwards it became a case of basically taking fish at will until moving to making tin rather than rubber soles the choice mode of transport over water.  Enjoy the sport and the board as there are more than a few fin junkies here who possess a wealth of knowledge to answer questions and lead you in the right direction regardless your species of choice.

The more you get to know me, the more you will see that I am sicka than your average......  I am from Durham, fishing mostly the east side of the GTA. I like to fish for anything that swims but my real passion is steelheading.  I get out as often as I can which has been 3-4 times a week on average.  First light, after work or mid day....I'll take what I can get.  Right now I'm float fishing but I just picked up my first fly rod and I cannot wait to learn on brookies this spring!  Does anyone else feel the way I do about steelheading? Thats probably a silly question....    "
