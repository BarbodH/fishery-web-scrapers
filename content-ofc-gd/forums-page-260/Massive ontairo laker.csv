831393,manitoubass2,2014-01-19 05:16:00,11391,Wicked nice fish! But on great slave or great bear these are like just above average lakers

831422,Acountdeleted,2014-01-19 14:01:00,2562,If I get one over 20lb I'll probably get one of those fake casts made up. Just personal preference.
831467,HTHM,2014-01-19 17:36:00,4082,That laugh.....just made me cringe.
831470,Terry,2014-01-19 17:46:00,14456," Yah it does.. but I'm pretty sure I know where that big rock is..  Here's Terry's video from Feb 2010.. I measured my boots after returning to my hut, at 13.5"" vs the 12 I thought they were, putting this fish at 47 to 48 in and the estimate calculator had it at 43 lbs.        that was a great fish"
831476,Freshtrax,2014-01-19 18:22:00,2215, In my mind that's like having a fake Rolex....not the same.   I know they look good n all.   Personal preference.

831482,jbailey,2014-01-19 18:55:00,866,"crazy, his reaction is priceless haha"
831483,Steve,2014-01-19 19:16:00,2075,"if anyone is looking for big lakers, in May - Lake Ontario there are many lakers caught over 20lbs.....usually approaching 30lbs....  cracking 30lbs is tough, but certainly attainable.  also, there are many of them, so you don't have to feel bad about keeping one for the wall."
831488,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-19 19:22:00,10439,"if anyone is looking for big lakers, in May - Lake Ontario there are many lakers caught over 20lbs.....usually approaching 30lbs....  cracking 30lbs is tough, but certainly attainable.  also, there are many of them, so you don't have to feel bad about keeping one for the wall.  Sure is a good place for big lakers in ON. Caught many over 20# there back in the day. When they used to stock them in the Ganny harbour in the 80's there was a great run in October with lots of fish over 24#'s to be caught. Biggest Ontario laker I ever caught was in the low to mid 30's off Pt. Credit during the summer after an offshore wind caused a good 45* upwelling just off shore."
831489,Steve,2014-01-19 19:24:00,2075,"you bet! we run 7'6"" light spinning rods with 4000 sized spinning reels, dropping cannonballs just off bottom.  a 20lbs laker on light spinning tackle is fun!"
831491,Freshtrax,2014-01-19 19:32:00,2215," The thought crossed my mind with this one...she came out of simcoe  while trolling for lakers in the summer, not sure on the weight but she was big..."
831492,Steve,2014-01-19 19:34:00,2075,"that's my break for walleye....actually, likely 16lbs.  but if I caught anything walleye related with a 16 in front of the weight - bonk."
831493,Jds63,2014-01-19 19:46:00,1365,"Wow that gets the blood pumping just watching the video, had a giant on last year and lost it but did manage to see it, so the quest for 20+ lb laker through the ice continues.  If that was Temagami, I wonder when that was caught , laker season doesn't open till Feb 15th."
831494,Terry,2014-01-19 19:51:00,14456,he was fishing for whitefish  I don't know .....
831501,Acountdeleted,2014-01-19 20:41:00,2562,Totally personal preference. I like the look of the fake casts and I think I'd like even more telling people when they see my mount that 'she's still out there. And she's even bigger!'
831509,Jds63,2014-01-19 21:38:00,1365,"according to the guy filming they were targeting lakers, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt , perhaps it was from last year or in a different zone that's open"
831571,Muskieman,2014-01-20 03:25:00,2472,"102 of my Facebook friends have shared the video , it drives me nuts , sure , BIG yes ,a very nice Laker , 30lbs or so , maybe even 35 ... but far from a near record , possibly an ice line class record if that even exists ,  the actual record for a Laker is over 100lbs , Canada's largest freshwater gamefish .  Sorry for ranting eh ."
831574,4x4bassin,2014-01-20 04:57:00,1025,"That is indeed a big lake trout for Ontario waters , congrats !"
831622,trapshooter,2014-01-20 17:31:00,1234,"The fish was caught in a lake near Atikokan, in NW Ontario.  It was not released.  Measured 43.75"" x 24"""
831260,Freshtrax,2014-01-18 22:32:00,2215,http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AzsyuFJIBpY&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAzsyuFJIBpY  I'm speach  less
831261,Muskieman,2014-01-18 22:34:00,2472,Nice Trout !
831265,irishfield,2014-01-18 22:49:00,26272,Yep very nice trout.. sure hope he let it go so it can grow up to Lloyd size! At least the gaf hit the right spot for a release.
831267,Moosebunk,2014-01-18 22:52:00,3970,"Yeah... saw that today.  Awesome fish.  No record I don't think but maybe for icefishing or line class, but still a big big fish and great catch.  With ya too Wayne, hope it was released."
831270,irishfield,2014-01-18 22:55:00,26272,Lloyd's Feb 2010 fish was bigger than that beast.. and he brought it through the hole on  4lb line.  Was the camera man scared of the thing.. ran away like a terrified school girl..
831272,Moosebunk,2014-01-18 23:08:00,3970,I still want one. lol.  NW Ont. in March.   Maybe it'll happen.
831283,manitoubass2,2014-01-18 23:43:00,11391,"That looks like the ""meathole"". Does it say which lake is was caught on? Wicked nice fish?"
831284,Acountdeleted,2014-01-18 23:58:00,2562,Well it was a nice fish. The way it was being handled I'm not so sure it is anymore.
831304,BillM,2014-01-19 01:00:00,17367,"Looks like it was pulled out of Temagami (or somewhere close) after a little investigation, lol.  Nice fish, that thing is a cow.  I'd guess 30lbs for sure."
831308,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-19 01:14:00,10439,"Looks like it was pulled out of Temagami (or somewhere close) after a little investigation, lol.  Nice fish, that thing is a cow.  I'd guess 30lbs for sure.  You're over by about 5#'s Bill."
831310,BillM,2014-01-19 01:19:00,17367,"Dave yeah, definitely not a 'near world record' like the guy who posted the video thinks...  But we all get excited, looks like they had a good time. (Although I don't know how that released after the gaff work!)"
831313,Acountdeleted,2014-01-19 01:37:00,2562,A buddy of mine showed me a video with similar gaff work a few years ago. I told him if he ever handled a fish that he wasn't planning on keeping like that I'd kill em.
831324,BillM,2014-01-19 02:05:00,17367,"He did get it under the jaw, it's not like it started to piss blood everywhere.  But the time out of the water isn't good for a beast like that."
831325,irishfield,2014-01-19 02:12:00,26272,Now if he had of been eating soup while it was making runs...  [/img]  
831326,Christopheraaron,2014-01-19 02:15:00,3525,"He did get it under the jaw, it's not like it started to piss blood everywhere.  But the time out of the water isn't good for a beast like that. Don't forget about that vertical hold."
831328,grizzlybri,2014-01-19 02:27:00,565,Don't forget about that vertical hold.  yea that boggles my mind why he would hold it like that after.
831338,manitoubass2,2014-01-19 02:51:00,11391,Im guessing he kept that fish
831341,Rod Caster,2014-01-19 02:56:00,5784,"Amazing fish and video. gawd I hope that happens to me some day.  One of the comments says it was caught near Attikoken, ON."
831349,irishfield,2014-01-19 03:06:00,26272,"Yah it does.. but I'm pretty sure I know where that big rock is..  Here's Terry's video from Feb 2010..

831353,Freshtrax,2014-01-19 03:12:00,2215,That beast would be on my wall.   My first laker over 20# is gettin a skin mount.   My grandfather had a 22lb'r outa simcoe on the wall and ever since I can remember I've wanted one.
831356,irishfield,2014-01-19 03:17:00,26272,No reason why not freshtrax.. says so right on your fishing licence! Well beyond breeding prime anyhow and I sure wouldn't be eating one of these 30+ year old fish.
831360,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-19 03:25:00,10439,Those are prime breeders in my waters.
831362,Joey,2014-01-19 03:27:00,9122,Awesome fish - Wow!
831363,irishfield,2014-01-19 03:28:00,26272,I'm not so sure the huge gals are still up to it Dave... either way he's free to do what he wants with his catch. We let the big gals go...
831370,BillM,2014-01-19 03:34:00,17367,"Amazing fish and video. gawd I hope that happens to me some day.  One of the comments says it was caught near Attikoken, ON.  One of the guys said it was caught on the lake he lived on.  After doing a bit of searching, he lives on Temagami.   But I wouldn't be surprised if that beast was from the Atikokan area... lots and lots of lake trout water around there."
