Booked cottages and ice huts and now i end up with 5 guys cancelling...right now we are only 7 and there's room for at least 5 more...if anybody is interested to come pm me and i will tell you the details...how much $, where and any other info you want. Looks like the forum is my last resort...or not?  Cheers!  Gino  "
