830699,redpearl99,2014-01-15 17:35:00,259,Anyone have  a recommendation for an operator that provides 2 holes per person?  I called the recommended operator in general (it think it was something like Big Bear Huts) and the guy said that their 4 man hut only has one whole in each corner or one large hole in the centre of the hut.  Im looking for a 4 man hut that will also each person to set 2 lines.  Red
830703,Renegade67,2014-01-15 17:49:00,86,If you had 8 lines down and you get a laker on it will wrap around all of those in a couple of seconds and then what?   Usually when more lines are close together it makes the fish leary to bite.  More lines does not equate to more fish caught. You want a second line then ask the operator to cut you more holes outside the hut. Perhaps perch fishing in 10 feet of water you could try using that many lines but it still sounds like a gong show....
830707,NightCrawler,2014-01-15 18:00:00,15,I rented from Daves on VB and we were two in a hut....with two large troughs..not holes..it was perfect for perch fishing we had two troughs each man had one line down opposite of eachother ( you could very very well have dropped 3-4 lines down per man per trough well spaced! I wouldnt drop more than three lines when perch fishing
830711,BucktownAngler,2014-01-15 18:19:00,582,should just setup a tipup outside the hut
830732,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-15 20:04:00,10439,Can't remember who I used to use but they had the old 1 giant hole in the middle. Like 2 or 3 feet wide by 7 or 8 feet long.
830733,davey buoy,2014-01-15 20:34:00,5505,"On Simcoe it is only allowed one fishing pole per person,and one tip up,clearly visible from 60yards from where you can see it."

830736,kuhaman,2014-01-15 20:43:00,503,"On Simcoe it is only allowed one fishing pole per person,and one tip up,clearly visible from 60yards from where you can see it. So I can't use two poles or two tip ups? Sorry if I'm missing something. Any way Lucky sons probably has what your'e looking for."
830737,Joey,2014-01-15 20:45:00,9122,"On Simcoe it is only allowed one fishing pole per person,and one tip up,clearly visible from 60yards from where you can see it.  You sure about that?  It is two lines, be it two poles or two tip ups, or 1 pole one tip up, but two lines no matter how you use them."
830739,Terry,2014-01-15 20:49:00,14456,Two lines may be used for ice fishing except in a limited number of waters (see the exceptions for the Zone in which you are fishing). You must be within 60 m (197 ft.) at all times of any line or tip-up you are using when ice fishing and you must have a clear and unobstructed view of the lines being used at all times. Any spring-loaded device which sets the hook for an angler may not be possessed within 30 m (98 ft.) of any waters.
830740,misfish,2014-01-15 20:56:00,29133, Oh my. Yer not going to start that thing up are ya?

That's what I just read last night for zone 16(Lake Simcoe)Having two poles in your hand at the same time would ahhh just not be right .lol.From what I gathered,one pole ,one tip up?Per person."
830751,irishfield,2014-01-15 21:12:00,26272,Then you'd be wrong Davey... two lines... whether it be sitting in your hut with two rods.. a rod and a set line.. a rod.. door open for view and a tip up within the 30m visual distance etc.

830762,irishfield,2014-01-15 21:26:00,26272,"Key words.. ""for instance"".. given example of a rod and tip up. Main key words ""fish with up to two lines at any time"" ! Tie them to what ever you want.."
830763,BillM,2014-01-15 21:28:00,17367,"  This is correct.  It doesn't matter if they are tip-ups, rods, 100ft pieces of rope with hooks on the end."

830772,Terry,2014-01-15 22:05:00,14456,he may be on to something there  I only want my one rod in my hand anytime

830854,BillM,2014-01-16 01:52:00,17367,"This thread just got a R rating thanks to Terry, lol!"
