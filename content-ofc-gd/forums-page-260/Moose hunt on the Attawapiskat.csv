828933,Skud,2014-01-07 04:21:00,739,After having a great time fishing at Eddie North's during the first week of Sept I looked forward to going back.. I had scored a trophy gator and walleye and I wanted to continue the streak.      I returned to the camp with my Father and Bro-in-law Mike for the first week of October to chase the mighty Moose. We had scored two Bull tags for the draw so we were pretty stoked.  We had a glorious sky greet us at the airport before had took off and headed for the river.    Once at camp we got right to it. We jumped in the boat and went looking for prime areas to do some calling. It was past the peek fall colours but the landscape was still beautiful.      We enjoyed plenty of wildlife while sitting tight waiting for a Bull to return our calls.      My Dad also was able to watch 4 wolves for about 20 minutes but he did get any pics. He enjoyed running along the river to find the perfect setup.    During midday we also managed to catch a few decent pike and some walleye for dinner.      We also enjoyed some pretty sweet skies and sunsets.         Things finally came together for Mike and he dropped the hammer on a great Bull.     It was a bit of work to get that beast out of that bay and into the boat but Eddie was still thumbs up.    It was a satisfying boat ride back to camp.     I look forward to heading north again for another adventure and I am glad that my youngest son is now old enough to join in the fun. He is looking forward to it also.     Coming soon........my Whitetail hunt report.

830793,Moosebunk,2014-01-15 22:49:00,3970,"Love seeing the shots from the fall Doug.  Have only ever gone on a hunt (tag along) once, and it was for moose on the Ekwan River north of the Attawapiskat.  Amazing memories."
830819,Ron,2014-01-16 00:27:00,1683,"Right on!  I used to hunt but no longer had time to fish and hunt. those Gators sure got me stocked though! Then again, moose steaks and Moose roast have got to be the best tasting wild game out there.  Cheers, Ron..."
