830998,Handlebarz,2014-01-17 03:04:00,3790,So my little girl tells us she has a boyfriend she is almost 14 where has time gone???  Anyway I guess today was as good as any day to share with her and the world my favourite song I heard it back in 2006? And when I did I knew it would come in handy down the road. I know all you dads will love it or do love it. Some have already lived the fear I am just approaching others have new little girls and get to build the fear. Either way Why must they grow up?  
830999,bigugli,2014-01-17 03:22:00,6138,"I have never been afraid of my daughter's encounters with boys as a teenager. Mind you, once the lads have been introduced to my fine collection of blades and axes, and some of the gun toting uncles, the lads become very, very afraid. Come to think on it, I've revoked and confiscated the man card of every fella Anna has ever dated.  I find this form to be very handy. I know it has been posted before.

Rule One: If you talk with foul words and dress like a bad ass, a punk or a wanna-be-gangster I will toss you right out on your tush.  Rule Two: If you date my daughter you date only her. She has a kind heart and I will not have you make my her cry; if she does, I will make you cry. You may only date ONE of my daughters. EVER.  Rule Three: You must know how to fish as well as I have taught my daughter(s) to fish. Frozen dinners do not count. My daughter ain't providing for you.  Rule Four: Do not be hurt when my daughter chooses a day fishing  with me over sports or gaming time with you. She was raised that family comes first and until there is a ring on her finger, I am her family, not you.  Rule Five: Do not date my daughter for her money because I am her bank. Do not expect gifts, she has been taught to be a savvy shopper.  Rule Six: Don't sleep with my daughter; the only rubber you should be concerned about is out in the driveway and has Goodyear stamped on it.  Rule Seven: Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a pudgy, baggy-eyed, last-season, has-been. But on issues relating to my daughter, I am the king of her universe. If I ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth. If you do not I will ask her. Do not trifle with me.  Rule Eight: My daughter has been raised to respect herself, so keep your hands to yourself. Offending body parts will be removed by me with a dull spoon.  Rule Nine: Do not be hurt when my daughter chooses spending time with me over spending time with you. She was raised that family comes first and until there is a ring on her finger, I am her family, not you. Yes, I know this is also Rule Four. It is an important one.  Rule Ten: My daughter is not a toy. She does not have Hasbro, Mattel or any other toy company tattooed on her person. Hence, she is not an object for you to play with, manipulate, and discard at your leisure. I've spent many years raising and loving her , and will unleash an unimaginable amount of anger such that the movie 300 will look like an episode of the Little House on the Prairie should you cross me.

831010,irishfield,2014-01-17 04:55:00,26272,My father in law only forgot to clean a gun in front of one fella that Leah brought home... he's been stuck with me for 35 years now !!  My girls can take care of themselves...
831026,Headhunter,2014-01-17 14:01:00,5703,"I have a plan in place for when my now 10 year old daughter begins dating. It involves a mayonnaise jar, a Louisville Slugger and testicles. You figure it out. I like your application form Bigugli! HH"
831033,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-17 15:32:00,8243,"Love the application, not many teens however would be able to fill it out, it's a piece of paper not a touch screen thing.  Since we were all boys, and did what boys did later in life were all blessed with daughters, Devine payback?  We had a fun thing we all did. My brothers would insist a niece bring the kid over on Sunday to the family home to say hello. Before date one.  She would have go around the big table and introduce everyone, this is my Godfather Uncle Cheech, this is my Godfather Uncle Santino, this is my Godfather Uncle Felice, etc. We all played it up, whispering in each others ear talking in riddles and code. Of course if we knew we had a new victim we all were sure to drive or borrow the Caddies and have fun like saying Uncle Joey couldn't be here because he's away at University, yea for 7 to 10.  They couldn't wait to get out of there, but not before of course our mother insisted they sit down and eat. Some never made it through the dinner, some never asked for the first date. Some are hanging around 20 years later with kids of their own, maybe too afraid to leave."
831055,bigugli,2014-01-17 19:11:00,6138,"It's the ones that can take a joke, and handle the ribbing, that are worth keeping around. So far, the daughter has not brought around any I would deem worthy. Although there was Matt, one of my scouts and part time sons, but Anna thought that would be like dating her own brother."

The name/reputation of the 3 brothers,made it easy. She found her man. And a good man he is. He races cars on the oval track."
831107,Handlebarz,2014-01-18 01:09:00,3790,LOL glad to see we think alike.  Brian I like that song a lot but ever since Jade was born I told the wife I was going to buy a gun so I can clean it when she brings boys over then 6 years later I heard that song I knew it was meant to be LOL  So I posted the link to facebook last night I guess jade was not impressed as she was pouting so much over it I felt bad so I untagged her but left the video up
