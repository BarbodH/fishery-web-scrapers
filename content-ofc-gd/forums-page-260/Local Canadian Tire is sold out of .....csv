Problem with the salt is that ALL the roads into Goderich where the salt mine is, were closed last week from Monday afternoon until Wednesday night. Cost me a run out east as well as the other 60 or so trucks that would be hauling it each day for 2and a half days...."

I've been in Lindsay 5 times in the last 2 weeks, wife works there every day, Yep roads are roads.  Got 5 bags of salt yesterday.  My brother-inlaw's brother lives in Cambray (small town /intersection just outside Lindsay)and has drives for a bunch of different companies over the years (AZ dump).  He is lucky to get work in the winter hauling salt to re-supply townships.  I'm sure there is a bit of a push on right now, eh.  Hey, when did the Lindsay store stop selling milk, that was kind of convenient.  Thanks for the info."

It never ceases to amaze me how we are led around by our noses and swallow everything corps and governments feed us and don't do anything about it. They change things to cut costs, sometimes at our own peril and we blindfully accept them. They funnel us into every facet of life like cattle and we just bow our heads and clop along in a row in total acceptance.  I thought we lived in the first world? If the internet or the cable was down we'd be on the phone within seconds whining and demanding the world while threatening to unleash our fury on anyone who failed to rectify the problem but with things of real importance we just meow, moo and bah.  Power of the masses I think not. More like the powerful stench of conformity."
831101,pics,2014-01-18 00:59:00,1268,propane prices go up and down at Costco depending on the market price.. The Ancaster store charges by the litre and most times the tank isn't fully empty to begin with. I then use a mr buddy adapter to refill the 1 lb tanks.(then tested with soapy water) so it costs about 60 cents for a 1 lb bottle. You have to take care to store them outside as well..

The woman in sports said that all propane an kerosene is owned by Coleman and American Co. and they don't know when they will get any more, as the US is getting bad weather.  She said that Coleman owns most propane in North America.  She also said they are having a hard time getting Ammo and Firearms too, and said she fears what would happen if the US and Canada got into a war, because we make very little for ourselves anymore.

830116,Craigson,2014-01-13 01:20:00,117,I think its more of a coleman issue distributing their tanks than a propane in general issue.

830141,woodenboater,2014-01-13 02:37:00,2277,"I predict a fire sale on generators this summer as people come to their senses and realize they were knee jerking by buying whatever was on the sales floor. Unless one is going to rewire their furnace, a genny is not going to do much to heat a house (something way more important that lighting) with space heaters.  I will admit to replenishing my stock of candles by a factor of 3x however  If I had a truck, I'd be cruising Toronto cherry picking the lumber piled on the road for the fireplace."
830161,fishindevil,2014-01-13 07:37:00,6254,Well our can tire up here in Lindsay usually has them all year round as we are used to power going out up here in the kawarthas and Haliburton and these can tires stores probly carry more of those things than the southern stores for that reason alon as well as cottagers who use them in the summer time when on their holidays check some of the stores on-line.   Like I said I have had a nice sized Hyundai genny for several years as most do outside of the city .... And lots of people heat with propane up here too and their have been shortages as well and the trucks are only filling people's tanks half full so there is enough to go around as demand has went way up thei winter because of it being colder than normal

But, just because they have them advertised on their website doesn't mean they gave them in store.  Although we weren't affected by the ice storm like they were down south or even to the west, I assume some people drove there to buy their stuff that was already sold out in the cities.  Lindsay, I think might be too far for most.  So they are not filling land tanks in the kawarthas?  Just half full?  That is no good.  Entropy"

The reason that things are so slow to restock is people are hording the supplies such as survival gear guns and ammo especially. We haven't had 22 ammo available for almost a year now. The factories have geared up to produce the 9mm .45, and other man stoppers for the hoarders to buy at a premium price I might add. A true lesson in supply and demand for those that love to watch people and their reactions to social media events.   Art"
830174,SirCranksalot,2014-01-13 13:29:00,3291,I question the wisdom of buying a CTC generator for an emergency. You need something you can count on. I suggest spend the extra $$ and get a good quality one such as a Honda.

830182,porkpie,2014-01-13 14:36:00,2521,"While I would agree with you in most things like that , I can't on the basis that we have run off brand gennies for years at our hunt camp, and put hundreds and hundreds of hours on them.  And yes eventually they fail, however it would surprise you how long they run before the Big Bang.  Maintenance is the key with them.  Most people who buy the cheaper ones will fill them with oil  And gas and never look at them again.  Guaranteed they will fail in an emergency.  If looked after, run often, oil changed once a year for light users, and the carburetor run dry by shutting down the gennie with the fuel shutoff valve instead of the off switch, I have no doubt that most of the champions etc. will power someone through a week long emergency.  If you are an end of the world type, then yes your right buy a honda but we've run cheap generators for so many hours without failure that on this I'd disagree!"

Ummmm, nothing here says that is a concern of mine, and I do agree it is odd that she said that but ... she did say that. Think about it, someone is understanding that Ontario is loosing - and no longer has -  a lot of industry that it once did.  Shouldn't a nation be able to 'supply' itself?  It would be great if we could, but in a day and age of Globalization, I think most countries also couldn't.  I watched a movie / video / documentary last night called 'Inequality for All'  it was ... interesting, and perhaps a bit informative.  I'm not the kind of person to analyse markets, and the distribution of wealth, but found it watchable.  It kind of played along a similar theme as this post.  Entropy"
