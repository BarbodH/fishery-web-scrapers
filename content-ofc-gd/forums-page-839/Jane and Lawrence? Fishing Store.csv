I believe it was called ""Fish On-Line"" or something to that affect.  I drove through the area just the other day... and I didn't spot it. Did they move? Owner retire? Or worse... Out of business?!  I'd like to visit the store...  Anyone with information would be much appreciated...  Thanks! RoB (A2F)"
