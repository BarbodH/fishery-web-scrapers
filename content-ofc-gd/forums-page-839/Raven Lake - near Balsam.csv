348016,Terry,2009-06-03 22:41:00,14456,"used to be big muskie  many of the fishing shows filmed muskie shows there, I am pretty sure I saw the same muskie on most of their shows and I think I caught every muskie in there at least 5 times  ..  it is very small it is just a flooded gravel pit  and some years ago a group of guys fished it every weekend for a whole summer and kept everything they caught I saw stringers of muskie hanging off the side of their boat  it was never the same again  last time I was there, there were only a few bass and a few perch... have not fished it in many years"
348045,gone_fishin,2009-06-03 23:53:00,481,so going there for the muskie opener would likely be a waste of time??? lol.  g_f
348049,Terry,2009-06-03 23:57:00,14456,unless in the last few years muskie have been stocked I would say no  but I guess it is possible that some small muskie that lived and a grown up somewhat......... it has been a while for me
348065,dada2727,2009-06-04 00:45:00,108,"I fished it last year and left without anything in the boat.  Seen a few muskie, some say they are hybrids in there but I have never boated on to see for myself.  The launch is pretty beat up, you need a 4X4 to pull a boat out of there on a trailer.  I wouldn't recommend it, I'd head to balsam or another kawartha lake."
348070,Terry,2009-06-04 00:54:00,14456,"so maybe it is coming back  all the time I fished it, the trail just ran into the water and that's where you back the trailer in most times the truck was in the water so far I would have to walk in the water to get out of the truck"
348081,dada2727,2009-06-04 01:28:00,108,"I would say very far from coming back, like I said, over the last 5 years I've probably logged 40 hours or so and not one muskie.  Hooked into one small one and lost it beside the boat a few years ago.  The water is very clear and shallow, so they are very easily spooked.  They are still in there, just few and far between and not a whole lot of size to them."
348093,gone_fishin,2009-06-04 01:47:00,481,awesome! thanks guys!  the info is much appreciated!  g_f
