269303,OhioFisherman,2008-11-19 08:40:00,6623,"Thanks bigugli, I looked it up, a better understanding of the differences now. We pay into ours I believe now until we make over 100,000 dollars. When I started working full time the cap was like 13,000?  Maximum benefit was 3,000 but that was only paid to people who made higher incomes and paid in more. We also get a cost of living adjustment annually.  Same deal here though, social security income only means a pretty meager living when you retire or become disabled.  All things considered I was very lucky when I became disabled to have enough time in to qualify for my pension from work also."

To my knowledge, we have never had any strikes, stoppages or shortages of workers. The reason that we have been so successful is that the unions and management work with each other, not against each other."

Big Three CEOs Flew Private Jets to Plead for Public Funds Auto Industry Close to Bankruptcy But They Get Pricey Perk By BRIAN ROSS and JOSEPH RHEE November 19, 2008  The CEOs of the big three automakers flew to the nation's capital yesterday in private luxurious jets to make their case to Washington that the auto industry is running out of cash and needs $25 billion in taxpayer money to avoid bankruptcy.  The CEOs of GM, Ford and Chrysler may have told Congress that they will likely go out of business without a bailout yet that has not stopped them from traveling in style, not even First Class is good enough.  All three CEOs - Rick Wagoner of GM, Alan Mulally of Ford, and Robert Nardelli of Chrysler - exercised their perks Tuesday by flying in corporate jets to DC. Wagoner flew in GM's $36 million luxury aircraft to tell members of Congress that the company is burning through cash, asking for $10-12 billion for GM alone.  ""We want to continue the vital role we've played for Americans for the past 100 years, but we can't do it alone,"" Wagoner told the Senate Banking Committee.  While Wagoner testified, his G4 private jet was parked at Dulles airport. It is just one of a fleet of luxury jets owned by GM that continues to ferry executives around the world despite the company's dire financial straits.  ""This is a slap in the face of taxpayers,"" said Tom Schatz, President of Citizens Against Government Waste. ""To come to Washington on a corporate jet, and asking for a hand out is outrageous.""  Wagoner's private jet trip to Washington cost his ailing company an estimated $20,000 roundtrip. In comparison, seats on Northwest Airlines flight 2364 from Detroit to Washington were going online for $288 coach and $837 first class.  After the hearing, Wagoner declined to answer questions about his travel.  Ford CEO Mulally's corporate jet is a perk included for both he and his wife as part of his employment contract along with a $28 million salary last year. Mulally actually lives in Seattle, not Detroit. The company jet takes him home and back on weekends.  http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/WallStreet/s...5739&page=1    <--- for the video..  G"

Let's crunch some numbers...  $50 billion from US in bailout money $10 billion from Canada  All for a company that could be bought OUTRIGHT for 500 million if every outstanding share was purchased.  So, for our 10 billion, Canada assumes a 12% stake in this glorious company.       Ahh yes.......it has been repaid alright.  A 10 billion dollar loan has been 'repaid' with a 12% stake in a 500 million dollar company, equaling 60 million dollars, or a measly 0.006% 'repayment'. That money is gone forever, Outlaw.  How does that crow taste?"

268899,albany_guide,2008-11-18 12:47:00,23,"I agree that the short term consequences would be ugly.  I don't want to diminish that.  I am not insensitive to the amount of people who will be out of work when the big three fail.  Here is the reality though.  If the big three were to fail either a new car company would emerge or one of the foreign companies would buy a number of the factories and continue production.  Not everyone will lose their jobs indefinitely.  There is still demand, just not enough to sustain the big three as we know them.  The most responsible thing to do is to let them fail and then give some money to help a new car company start up that is not so poorly run.  We should not be rewarding this type of mismanagement and short sightedness.  Think of it this way.  If the government had continued to bail out the east coast fishery, they would still today be a poorly managed and unsustainable 'industry' that was in need of perpetual cash infusions every few years.  Did it hurt when the fishery collapsed?  Of course!  Are they better off for it today?  Definitely!  They are now a 'have' province since they have refocused their production base towards other industries, namely energy.  We will do the same here in Ontario.  We'll emerge from this much stronger in a few years if the government does the right thing.  If not, the big three will continue to slither back to the government 'teet' looking for more cash to burn."

Lets see, crap cars, overpaid workers, annual millionaire CEOs, mis-management, telling Americans not to sell to Canadians because they're too greedy to devalue the car when our Dollar was Par.

We are not going to be the ones solving the problems despite any good that comes from this discussion. The politicians won't give a tinker's damn for what we think. There is also no good that comes from all the feuding. Bottom line, we, as a society, got greedy and must now pay the piper. So for a minute take a hard lesson from the history books. Eighty years ago the crash of '29' brought on two decades of hard times and strife. The rich survived and flourished despite what was happening to the rest of society. But what about the regular shmucks like us. People like us got through it, survived, and still lived life to the fullest. They just became a lot more realistic about things. They worried about the things that mattered most. Despite the depression, and the war that followed, they worked harder, tightened their belts, worked together and took care of their own. My Grampa was known, sometimes with Gram's diapproval, for always helping his neighbours. If he had a good day on Simcoe and caught a bushel of whities my Grampa would share it with the neighbours. Same with smelt or perch. Gram got mad because she had cleaned all them fish first   He would think nothing of leaving a quarter from some animal on a friends doorstep because they could not afford to buy meat. Four men would scrape together every penny to run out for the  duck hunt and share 1 box of shells between them. My uncle took payment for jobs in produce to barter down in Simcoe. Anybody who fought knows that survival required teamwork and co-operation. You didn't do it on your own. We may just have to relearn those lessons."

One thing for sure...Its coming one way or the other. The buy out only prolongs the unavoidable. So why waste federal reserves up on a temp solution that could potentially help prop up social services in an impending and prolonged crisis?  If I honestly felt the buy out would fix the situation I'd say go for it... Its been turned down for a good reason...its not a sustainable solution.  One of the most impactfull, non bias, and truthful statement WAY back on the first page of this thread speaks volumes to how to survive the impending crunch. It came from Ted & the Gadget....

When I graduated from high school, I wanted to work with my hands and my mind, and of course I wanted to make a good buck. So I chose a unionized trade. It's turned out to be a great choice, for me anyways. I've made a decent buck along the way. I have great benefits. A couple of pension plans which should easily let me go fishing every day after I turn 58. And I'm supposed to feel guilty about this? I planned for my future and things are going well.  I have pride in my work. I often find that I don't have enough time in the day to accomplish what I want to. My union doesn't babysit me. In fact, in 31 years I've never had to rely on my union to solve an issue or provide a job for me. If I didn't produce, I'd be ""on the books"", which means I'd be looking for work. Currently I'm running a 1.8 million dollar renovation job at a local Ontario government building. I bid the job. I ordered the equipment. I picked all of the 14 sub contractors. It's my baby. Often I wake up at 3 or 4 am thinking about the job. I never fall back to sleep again when that happens. But I'll get it done on time and on budget. Would I be doing this for anything less than union wages and benefits? Not a chance. I made my bed and I'll lie in it. I suggest that everyone else quit whining and do the same."

269233,albany_guide,2008-11-19 02:44:00,23," Check your own facts outlaw.  To say it was 'repaid' is putting it loosely.  It was repaid by issuing more bonds.  If I borrow $20 from you and then 'pay' you back by borrowing the $20 from someone else, is that showing you that I am managing my funds well?  At what point does that end?  It is a flawed business model, which is exactly why they're back asking for more. If they are so fiscally responsible, explain how the big three are collectively burning billions of dollars a month."
269295,OhioFisherman,2008-11-19 06:00:00,6623,"but everything had to be legit? LOL I don`t know how your system works up there. We have a social security retirement-disability plan here in the states.  Cash money maybe nice if you use it wisely, most people I have seen here make it and use it.  No money paid into the social security plan for it, they don`t bother putting it into a 401k. Ours is based on legit income, money you don`t report doesn`t increase what you get for a retirement check, or disability income if something should happen to you to cut short your working career.  LOL I have friends and even family members that went the cash money way, now whining that they only will get 600-700 a month from social security and can`t retire.  Might seem like a good deal now but it can screw you up later. Every job I took was legit, just made more sense to me."

But if they don't like the fact their job does not compensate them to their expectations they usually go elsewere to a company that meets their needs union or not.  You don't need a union to incure teamwork, and you certainly don't need a union to run a fair place of employment these days. Its actually pretty rare to see a union move in these days... 90% of places that are unionized have been so for longer then I've been around, and I think that speaks volumes to their place in todays business world. There was a time they were invaluable...not so sure they have not run their course now though?  Greed is rampant in all industry, I wouldn't peg the union as the only cause(never have), but don't forget how bound to ""agreements & Union contracts"" some of these Acheivers are when making desicions... If I was told I had a 25% defiecit to recoup and I Couldn't touch the labor, the shifts, benefits or tweak the daily Operations Standards, thus had no way to increase labor effeicency what choices are left? All that is really left to do is cheap out on product unless you can find a way to minimize overhead(which is usually fixed) or you have to drive revenue through the roof somehow to exeed your targets(tough to do in this market) My point in a nut shell, Those poor decisions are not always poor. Sometimes when your hands are tied all you can do is kick in the dark to try and hit somthing...anything  Blame is blame, and it begets blame I suppose... The real question is how will it, or will it get fixed at all?  Really I just think the Business model for the big 3 is outdated and fundimentally screwed from the bottom up... You simply cannot make a recovery with out drastic cuts, and drastic change, and the union won't let that happen so its only a matter of time until its busted, or folded....the writing is on the wall and only the workers can make that desicion when it comes around.   Agreed. There are always a few folks on each side that spur the others on....no doubt In that instance I was the new hired gun at the time, and came in a week after the contracts had been settled I had been there about a month.

268298,Rattletrap2,2008-11-17 02:51:00,1652,"Wow, lots of reading here! First off, I have worked for Unionized employers all of my adult life. I spent the first three working for an aircraft company that was CAW/UAW. It was a totally screwed up mess on all sides! The union and the company were to blame.  I don't think you can make blanket statements about all unions. The Trade Unions (construction trades)are a completely different thing than the unions in the manufacturing sector.  I also worked for a ""Family"" business that was also unionized for over 22 years. This company could be one of the most ruthless outfits out there! Office staff who were not unionized were extremely poorly treated. In this case, the union was important to set standards for the unionized workers. Although I was always treated well ( and worked very hard for this treatment), I can honestly say that I felt for sorry for a lot of people who were abused, and this was one of the reasons I gave it up.  I am now employed by the Union and am proud of this. I can tell you that no one is lazy, protected for the wrong reasons, or overpaid! We all work long hours and give it everything we have! I think you will find this in most Trade Unions. I would think that DanC for example works damn hard for his money and deserves every penny of it. He is trained and highly skilled. Working conditions would make some people cringe! People in our industry who can't cut it, are unemployed!  Let's just be careful of using too wide of a brush when painting some of these pictures!"

268338,OhioFisherman,2008-11-17 06:25:00,6623,"Just my overall view that somewhere along the line the system fell apart and I am really not sure what is the cause. Things seemed a lot more comfortable in the 60`s and early 70`s with the cash we were making and the prices we were paying.  Even though there were more unions here at the time their seemed to be less grief, more strikes though. People just seem to get bent out of shape easily now. Maybe myself too? Glad work is over for me, the politics of the work place got old.  Did want to try something else though, a new challenge! Now walking is my challenge!"
268342,Rich,2008-11-17 10:29:00,3927," No but without a union, the company could easily ""modify"" or even remove completely your benefits and bonuses and you'd have no say in the matter."
268344,outllaw,2008-11-17 11:17:00,1232,"buyouts or bailouts. if the automotive sector fails, the country of canada will see a deep recession. the answers not to blame the unions, or workers. its executives that are greedy. why not blame management not joe with a mortage and 3 kids.. in 79-80 moneys were lent for re-structuring, and yes it was re-paid. thru that millions of families benefited thru gainfull employment.. theres much more to look at other then the auto industry. .. maybe working together to rise above would be better then frenzy feeding on people in need."
268374,holdfast,2008-11-17 13:01:00,1813," Like I said earlier, where else do you make $70 an hour inside a nice building and you just press buttons.  Compare that to an oil worker driving a pressure truck class 3a working outdoor Alberta, Saskatchewan winters 12 -15 hours a day, having 4 Safety courses including First Aid and dealing with pressure valves that can a  cremate block of Buildings at 18-25 dollars an hour.  Oh by the way- Canada Post is doing their Typical strike thing just before Christmas as usual.  Two years ago CUPE Saskatchewan decided to walk out during three of the worst storms in Sask.  Were talking about Emergency workers and snow clearance.  You want to see how they threatened us if we voted Sask Party instead of the NDP.  Sask Party won and put a bill in place no walk outs during time of Crises"
268442,albany_guide,2008-11-17 15:30:00,23,"Let's try to make some sense of the proposed bailout.  The bottom line is that the big three are making cars that no one wants to buy.  I'm going to use some simple numbers here for illustration sake. Let's say the big three are producing 100,000 cars a year, but right now the demand is only for 50,000.  As a result, the companies are bleeding cash to try to stay afloat.  So, the idea is we will bail them out with additional funds so they can continue to produce 100,000 cars a year and no one will lose their job.  Question:  At what point will people begin buying all these excess cars?  There is no way out of it.  Supply will continue to out-pace demand.  Bail out or not, the big three will eventually fail."
268449,Cookslav,2008-11-17 15:39:00,1457,"Sure I would agree but... What I'm saying is you should go get yourself a suit if it doesn't sit well with you that they get the benefits. Some if not most of the these ""big suit guys"" put the time & Energy to get to there....so why shouldn't they get the rewards? With all due respect... I'm an Exec now, not in the Auto sector of course, but in the Hospitality industry. I worked as a dishwasher, cook, kitchen manager, Apprentice chef with a 4 year apprenticeship moved on and held the title of chef d'partie, sous chef, and Executive Chef, Earned my C.C.C, tinkered as a Food and beverage Manager, am continuing to earn my Master Chef Designation on the side and continued in Schoolastic learning to get My CFBE certification(Certified Food & Beverage Executive). I came from a Family of 7 on a single income(Dad was a plumber)...we got by comfortably but I had no financial help. I hussled my A$$ to get were I am today. I make bad desicons too, but I make some pretty good ones as well....I'm human Yes I earn 4 times what a line level employee does...absolutely But I am responsible for his Supervisors, boss, their boss, and their Boss and so on and so on.... I make their expected Targets/plans for the year based on the Company thresholds, the market expectations, and I use my experience/education to set them up for success. So really, When the poop hits the Fan its my A$$...not the employee So My combined education/experiece and hard work set me up for the job, but I'm paid for the responsibilty of leadership. If I fail I get fired. Thats why Execs get paid well. Its not Always a greed thing, sometimes its well earned. And for the record its not always proportional....you'd be surprised I get paid less then many on the board I'm sure. But I like my Career, and I'll keep pushing it further to earn more for my Kids, my wife, and myself. I've never been comfy with the idea of sitting tight....Big Suit or not Anyway, My Employees have every opportunity I had to better themselves. If they want to they can, but if they want to sit put then thats fine too...but for sure they have not earned the right to tell me I'm overpaid, or call me a Fat cat, big Suit, or what have you. For the record I have a great Climate in my place of employment(non Unionized) I'm just telliong you were I come from.... You keep what you earn, and we reap what we sow  One can also look at it this way. A business owner who starts his own business gets to call the shots...its his investment He can pay what he likes, if you don't like the enviroment....go elsewere Don't forget Its always in the buisness owners, or Execs best interest to keep employees happy. If he or she treats his employees like crap he'll lose them, and rampant turnover will kill his consitency, and in turn no one gets a good name based on hit and miss product.  If your content to stay were you are in a line level postion in a factory I think you should be pretty grateful for $30/hour and benefits cause as mentioned earlier.....there are about 3 guys lined up behind you who would take that job for $20/hour no questions asked. If the place treats you good then stay, if not move along. I suppose a union can help keep an employee happy...but in the instance of the big 3 its now come back around to bite the employees in the A$$. It worked well for years in the eys of the employee, but its now about to out price your value to the company. The big three will evaluate if continuing on in this model is sustainable, and decide to change....will the union allow it? We'll see. Thats all I'm saying"

268514,LeXXington,2008-11-17 19:28:00,1928,"Should be locked soon but here we go.  Say right away for 3 years! Take 20% of all employee's pay. Top and bottom No bonus or incentives. cut unproductive lines, cut costs etc. Massive changes  Funny how the Union and Management are not doing this, and asking for more.  When the ship is sinking you do what you can too live.. with Sailors saying it an't my job and the captn saying I'll wait for help. Boat will sink and no one wins  Union contracts will make good fire starter as your hudling around a burning barrell.   My 2006 Dodge truck at 28k needed a complete brake job to stop squeeking.. I told the dealer so its just going to make loud squeeks right, yeap you still have 80% pads left they have just rusted ... Great I said I will drive it till I have 10% left and every person who complains about my squeek I will tell them never by a dodge.  Word of mouth!"
268605,OhioFisherman,2008-11-17 22:36:00,6623,"Always nice to discuss issues that affect us and to be able to keep it civil.  How is bailing out (in our case, USA) Auto companies any different than bailing out New Orleans, Florida, the gulf coast area in general? We have repeatedly spent billions of tax dollars to help our people there and no end in sight.  Poor choices in places to live? and continuing to do so? Do we stop or impose regulations? On what and where they can build?  I haven`t agreed with any of the bail outs proposed, but glumly accepted they may be needed short term and a lot more changes should have been made to the terms.  The jobs numbers here keeps growing, how do you recover with out jobs? Wait years possibly for people to be retrained? For what jobs?  New figures I saw today says 30 percent of homeowners with mortgages will be under water by the end of next year. In my area, deemed conservative, suburban, rural, wealthier area they now have the foreclosure actions at the fairgrounds because of the numbers of them. Just drives down the value for every one involved.  This can`t get turned around with out jobs? LOL and better planning and leadership?"
268616,holdfast,2008-11-17 22:52:00,1813,"But with this bailout, will we, the Tax payers get our money back.  heard nothing about that.  Seems like a freebee to the Fat Cats to pocket more money.  Chapter 11 Bankrupcy and start all over.  Weed out the incompetant Fat Cats.  Less models, more Quality, cut pay in half and rid the Union.  Lower vehical Prices, dont put all your apples into SUVs (Idiotic).  If they need tax payer money we get it back with interest with a cap on CEOs.  Is that Conservatism? Maybe its their hidden agenda eh.  Really its HOLDanomics"
268631,misfish,2008-11-17 23:25:00,29133,"I finally had a good convo with my manager about this whole thing(he has seen it all) and even told him about my post. He decided to read it and said I was kinda on the right track along with others here. Even though we are staying up with the times,he did mention to me one things that really made me sit back and think.  What will happen to the 100,000 of people that get let go???????????????????????????   I had no answer then,but later came back and said to him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Can we keep going this way????????????  Im waiting for his answer."
268634,albany_guide,2008-11-17 23:27:00,23,"At the end of the day it is still a supply and demand question.  I still want someone to answer my simple question:  If we give them taxpayer money to continue to produce more cars than we are buying, WHO WILL EVENTUALLY BUY ALL THESE CARS?  THAT is the question that needs to be answered.  It is a simple question, but VERY important for the long-term sustainability of the industry. It should be clear that a handout is not the answer.  The big three will still fail!"

268669,Rich,2008-11-18 00:11:00,3927,"It seems the simplest solution would be cut the amount of vehicles being produced and deal with the paycuts.  Now were this to happen - who would be more upset? The line workers who get a 5 dollar per hour paycut?  Or the execs who go from 5 million to 3 million per year?  Hmmmmm....  It's like - they've been at the top of the ladder raking in dough easily for so long that now that things aren't flowing in their direction, they're panicking. Drop employee wages.  There are TONS of people who will do their job for $15/hour! And probably work harder!"
268673,BUSTER,2008-11-18 00:15:00,1336, the handout would be for the companies to re-tool the factories and design vehicles that are appealing the the general public plus be enviromentally efficient with fuel and carbon print .

268717,albany_guide,2008-11-18 01:27:00,23," ...right!  So other automobile companies saw the need to change years ago (think Toyota and Honda) while the big three continued pumping out gas guzzling pieces of crap.  So because they lacked the foresight, we should now come to their rescue with taxpayer money?  Even if the money was being used to create newer plants that produce more fuel efficient cars, the demand is STILL not there to support the companies as they are.  The big 3 build 17 million new cars a year in the US.  Current demand calls for 10 million.  That 7 million discrepancy is not solely because their cars are gas guzzlers.  They are building TOO MANY CARS!!!   Period!!!!!!!  Let's be real, any money given to the big three will be used to survive for a few more feeble months.  They are bleeding BILLIONS a quarter.  The big three as we know them are FINISHED!  No amount of money can be handed out to make people in North America buy an additional 10 million cars annually.  It's not going to happen!"

267751,OhioFisherman,2008-11-15 19:25:00,6623,"Castaway, over time pay, some sacrifices involved, you could work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day, pull double shifts. Nothing like feeding the machine for twice as long? You got to give up free time activities to secure your future.  Auto companies had a different retirement plan than the Teamster`s both had 30 and out plans. Auto company workers took pay increases, and larger ones than the Teamster workers asked for. Our pension plans were also different, theirs run by the companies, ours run by our union.  Auto workers got 3000 a month, but when they reached an age that social security kicked in the companies reduced their pension by the amount they received from social security.  The Teamster workers paid in more overall and ours doesn`t reduce when we receive social security. Their were some changes made to ours shortly after I retired, but because I was already retired they don`t affect me.  There were years when I made 60+k a year, didn`t get to do much else, planning for retirement.  We also had an option to have pay deducted and put into a 401k, ask me why I am glad I didn`t. Paid off the house and debt instead. Between payroll deductions for social security, and money paid by the company instead of wages into the Teamsters retirement program it was around 350 bucks a week. Companies match of social security included.  Most people here complain about our social security program and have no real understanding of how it works. Take a look at our stock market and the 401k plans, if you were planning on retiring from one of them any time soon you probably don`t feel to secure."

They aren't going to give 100%... they're just going to do what they have to to get by... but why should they show extra effort? Their pay will stay the same regardless, because a union scale says so!    i worked for union gas for several yr's and i cant agree more"

The quality of domestics has improved, but it may be too late. In all fairness to the guys on the line I don't believe in the past couple decades you can blame them for the quality. Engineering is/was to blame for most of it. Designed only to last so long as cheap as possible."

I asked what their plans were to repair a common problem with a couple of vehicles. He looked me straight in the eye and said with a smirk ""what problem?"""
267853,misfish,2008-11-16 01:32:00,29133,  What was the problem?????

So we do a salt brine heat test.Also do an outside test with the same. We have had parts now, outside for the past 10 years and they are as strong as they were when first made.  I see them everyday, as they are where I go for my stress relief smoke.LOL Sure they are not being used,but I would say what we do is, a good telling story of what our quality is all about."
267863,Rich,2008-11-16 01:54:00,3927," Start up something how? I wrote my opinion. I understand your point to a degree. But to blame the workers.. well by that logic we'd be blaming you? I don't get it.  We are a unionized company and trust me, nobody gets to slack off. The management is ridin' our butts to move, move, move non stop. Then again, our management is non-unionized which means head office is riding their butts even harder."
267888,Bernie,2008-11-16 02:30:00,3190,"Like I said . It was in the past and things have improved. But not entirely. Why am I replacing brake lines on GM vehicles that are 2004 models. Why are suspension components becoming bad on Chryco and why did the trans drop out of my sons 2005 F150. Why did the Camry I had last close to 400,000 km with  no major repairs.  Not bashing anyone here. Just calling it as it is.  PS. By the way. Do you remember the transmissions in Aerostars and Bronco II""s from 1986 to 1990? They were a bit of a problem.

268102,Cookslav,2008-11-16 18:55:00,1457," Sure...and the same could be said for the Auto sector. Why pay a Union employee twice what I could pay a non union employee especially when the the facts seem to point to better production effeciency is found in non unionized employment? I suppose the doctors will continue to go to the States untill we pay them more, and the big three will continue to become more and more obsolite until they bust the unions and level their labor expenses, or simply go the way of the dinosaur.  Sure but... So did the Trades...as Brian said ""the time they are a changing"", and so must we.   Of course not... But of course settling into a line level postion does dictate what you get fiscaly, and obviously limits you to whats available. Those who know that, and are content with that, are well off and quite smart...heck maybe even smarter then most. If you can enjoy the simple things in life, and be happy with out pushing yourself further then need be to get there....ya I'd your a smart person, and better off then most. But then there are those who don't realize the limitations, don't live with in their means, and are bitter about people who worked hard to get a bit further ahead, and Blame the high acheivers for their postion....ya there are certainly sharper knives in the drawer then those folks. The problem is the union loves those guys...theres the vocal minority I spoke of in a nut shell  True buts what the message... I can think of a few exsamples many people got on board with regards to a unified voice that didn't go so well....Nazi Germany comes to mind....thats a stretch of course. But really, What ever happened to  ""team work""....Do you need a union for that?  Last time I tried to Help a guy clean up his station in a unionized establishment I got greived...appearently there is a lot of Individualism out there with in the unions as well."

The fact is Toyota and Honda are **better engineered vehicles** that are, in many instances, assembled in North Amermica.  I have an acquaintance who is an engineer for the Mercedez Plant in Alabama.  He used to work for Toyota.  If you ask him today, he'd admit that Mercedez is BEHIND Toyota in this regard ... they are getting closer, but they are not there yet.  If union workers assembled Toyota cars, I suspect that they would still be the quality vehicles that many of us have come to appreciate.  Toyota engineers have to work in the assembly plant for 2 years before they get to be engineers ... there is a reason for that. The difference is the engineering.  Cheers,  - M"
268125,holdfast,2008-11-16 19:51:00,1813,"I listened to a Talk show on this Question.  Should the Government Bail these guys out?  Here's what I learned,  Most say no.  But the Canadian Government Basically has their hands tied in that the States are putting in Moneys to Bail the Companies across the Border.  We'd be stupid not to follow suit as you can see ,if I was the Government or Company Id take care of our own first.  Detroit Vice Ontario.  Secondly, Ford goes down the competition will taker up the slack.  Unlike a Bank going down.  Now this is unbelievable.  A person with benifits is making shy of seventy dollars an hour.  When he gets that pension, he will not have paid into it enough to, not warranting moneys coming from else where.  The consenses would be, that the Government would give cash under these conditions.  Fat Cats dont touch a cent of it.  The Union and the worker takes a pay cut.  The management has to covince the Government that the money is not going to incure more loses due to Mis-management.  Makes sense but that wont happen.  CEOs and the Union will look after themselves as usual first.  Most listeners figure they should just declare Bankruptcy and start over.  This Bailout money is definitely protectism that has the overseas companies steaming.  Its one thing that we continuously Bail out Air Canada and Bombardier, but at least they're Canadian."

Im not a very interlecuale (HELL CANT EVEN SPELL THAT WORD) guy when it comes to this typing stuff and saying my words. Sorry. If they were to become unionized,then it will be the same as the big three.We want more money because they know they are number 1,then it becomes like the rest. 8 hr job and well I did my part.

Most of the time a Teamster, I don`t disagree there were abuses, on both sides.  Nazi Germany is a stretch, people that didn`t follow the leader there were dead.  I do question some of the high achievers though, all at once they are worth 300 times their employeed pay instead of 30? For poor decisions?  The doctors pay is also sort of a different issue, very hard to tell if your getting your monies worth, for me there were questions. But in my opinion a better system up there.  The auto companies (American) in my opinion haven`t done a good job designing or building cars, no one to blame but themselves, but I have never owned a foreign car, and only two new ones. Not a priority for me.  The idea has been for each generation to have a better life than the last, we elect our politicians considering that, (allegedly?) They seem to be giving it away to other countries at our expense.  If managements pay can rise through the workers efforts, shouldn`t the workers? and for blame to be fixed on solely the workers?  Grieved? LOL the management and union agree on what jobs are deemed union jobs? Union workers are expected to follow the agreement? I know what you mean though. Tough call on that, I had some foremen working right along side me at times, others understood because of their past behavior they were in a management position. Don`t expect me to overlook things if you want to micro-manage me.  I passed on management positions, I thought some people were idiots, on both sides."

267442,John,2008-11-14 18:24:00,2956,"I tried to stay away from this but.........  A huge portion of my sales comes from the auto industry. Not directly as it used to, but now indirectly from Brose and other non-North American companies, who through amazing efficiency and cost control, still seem to be able to make money even in challenging markets.  I used to sell directly to Ford, who spun off the division to Visteon, who became ACH, who are now once again Ford. This division has lost huge money perennially, independently of who owned what. I understand the hard to swallow salaries and bonuses of the CEO's and CFO's and have my own opinions there, but those obscene ""packages"" are really a drop in the ocean compared to the other mismanagement that has accumulated the massive legacy costs and payrolls that the so called big three now have to deal with.  One example of gross mismanagement is one couple that I know, (quite well), both still work at one of the US big three divisions. He is a line supervisor and she operates a small machine. They are both unionized. Now comes the fun part. He schedules her work and her hours. He also has (had) the ability to work unlimited overtime. So, they could both work together, (at overtime rate), and sleep together, as they chose. Between them they make (made) well over $250,000.00 US for each of the last 10+ years............This example of wages is not by any means unique. Many, many of the Ford and I suppose GM and Chrysler unionized workers live (lived) very well in large homes with ""fleets"" of new automobiles... Yet, anytime that I visited the plant, the work ethic and pace was at best pathetic.  Who is to blame..........? The exec's, the unions, the workers, government, or you and me............The auto makers give us what we want and what sells.  It seems to me that the culprit is the same as it was in all of history..............greed. We have become accustomed to living beyond our means. As long as we have the ability to cover our monthly outgoing, then all is well with the world. As soon as the source of cash dries up................well you know!"

I stopped buying N/A cars for a simple reason - the Japanese buld them much better.  I have a 1996 Toyota Camry, getting ready to turn over 200K and other than routine maintainance and a few very minor issues, she runs like the day I bought it (used).  Unions are not the problem ... lousy N/A cars are the problem.  Cars are different than many items people buy ... once burned you lose the confidence of the consumer for many, many years ... often generations.  On the other hand, if you have a good experience (Toyota and Honda seem to know this best) then you will be back ... even if it costs you a little more.  Cheers,  - M"

Just a thought as anyone from the Hammer knows, Stelco was unionized after a long nasty fight in the 1940's, Dofasco the other steel giant down the street remained non union and did treat their employees with respect and fairly. Why? Some around here say it was their way to keep out the United Steelworkers and others say because Stelco management were cruel while their counterparts had respect.  But then it is all history now, US Steel = Stelco and Dofasco is Mittel. Oh well.  I really don't think the unions are the culprit when it comes to the North American auto industrie's troubles. Everything goes boom and bust and this could be it's turn to go bust.  And as for Canadian built vehicles, some the Toyotas and Hondas are built here in Ontario. These cars are more Canadian than some of the N. American vehicles that many of us are driving.  IMHO.  Cheers to all."

Not only do I see it in this thread, but on the job too! These people aren't working for the company that signs their paycheck, they're working for the union that they have to give a portion of their paycheck to!!!(extortion?) These people have been brainwashed with propaganda for so long, they actually believe it!  Is this the type employee you would want working for you if you owned a company?... I think not! They aren't going to give 100%... they're just going to do what they have to to get by... but why should they show extra effort? Their pay will stay the same regardless, because a union scale says so! I personally believe a persons pay should be based on their experience, effort, ability, and attitude! This system provides a much more productive work force!  It would be in Ford and GM's best interest to shut down completely and reopen under new names in an area that has the ""right to work"" law and people that will appreciate a good job!

I don't think the workers are to blame for this, nor the unions. It's corporate execs making horrible decisions, looking for the cheapest way to make a buck.  The company I work for is doing the same thing. Clowns from head office who have never seen meat outside of a restaraunt are sending us instructions on how to do our job. Their way doesn't work in the real world, but they can't see that. Mostly because they've never entered the real world outside of their limo!"

267705,Cookslav,2008-11-15 18:07:00,1457,"Another thing I love about the unions... blame the CEO's, blame the Execs, blame the top dollar earners, and managment... sorry but I find it hard to blame the people who busted their Asses when they were young to get a formal education or skilled trade, and hustled their but to earn results, respect in their field, and now have the responsibility to ""lead"" their comapnies.... These people worked hard to get to that position.  True some are Greedy, and over paid...but most earned their keep and ""bettered"" them selves to be were they are in their ""CAREER"" As opposed to ""settleing"" into an unskilled, uneducated role on a line ""JOB"" somewere. True some guys work their butts off, but some sit back and push the minimum, and rely on the unions to keep that easy pace safe as well. To each their own I suppose, but I find it reeeely tough to grasp the concept of blaming the acheivers, over the status quo.  Besides You can't blame an exec who's hands are tied with outragous Labor costs that are litteraly carved in stone by the union. The costs of a car is outrageous, and its directly related to the cost of production... So do the simple math here, The unions are very very much responsible for a large part of this, not 100% of course, but they are the single largest cost factor...labor usualy is.  Simply put, Costs need to be cut to get expenses in line, sales prices need to come down in order to spur purchases, and the product quality needs to be maintained. How can that be done with an overpaid ineffiecent work force, that cannot be replaced, or even improved? If you come up with that answer you deserve 2million/year as an executive hands down, because you just solved this issue.  Sure.... Go ahead and blame the Execs who by the way have been talking to this issue for years but can't do anything about it.... I guess because they make lots of money they are guilty right?  I suppose by the same logic the doctor shortage, and state of our health care must be the fact we pay our doctors to much right? Never mind that they went to school well into their mid 30's, and spent $100,000 on tuition, and spent countless hours on internships, and deal with LIFE AND DEATH every day to earn their lifestyle.... By union logic we should cut the doctors salary so we can pay the receptionists, and janitorial services $40/hour and let them have a bigger voice in how we run our health care.... Union thinking would have us beleive we don't need leadership, the little guys should run 51% of the comapny. Sounds great if you live in a story book but its not realisitc.  The union mantality is delusional... Sorry but in truth I would bet my life savings if you busted the unions in the auto sector there would be a Line up 100 miles long of people more than willing to fill those line level jobs for a fraction of what the current guys make, and the only crying would be comming from the former union employees...and ask yourself this How many union employees would cross that picket line for a 25% pay reduction as opposed to loseing their job? Cause its gonna come to that....  Pesonaly I'd like to see the Unions busted. I'd bet a pair of fresh eyes, and an eagar new work force not embittered with union mantality would increase the effeicency 10 fold, and be just what the doctor ordered for the big 3.   Unfortunatly for the militant...there is little support out there for the unions round here, just calling it like I see it. I'd go as far as to say its nothing more then a vocal minority, and its a matter of time till the winds of change roll around."

The problem with your doctor shortage is simple, US, as in USA, and the logic similar. Why stay in a country when you can cross a near by border and make more. Your government doesn`t prevent it, ours certainly won`t.  Similar logic as free trade, why do it here when we can do it there but for less? but in reverse, how can you possibly expect to keep doctors? The same logic with jobs, if it can be done somewhere else cheaper they might all go away.  My sons orthopedic for his knee injury was a doctor from Southern Ontario.  If you studied anything about the auto companies history they had trouble keeping help, a boring job and a turnover rate approaching 50%, it took a decent pay check to get people to stay.  Forgotten in this discussion is inflation`s effect, I started with the Teamsters in May of 73 making 5.99 and hour, you could get a brand new van for 3100 bucks and a new house for 28,000. Average worker has seen an overall loss in purchasing power and isn`t smart enough to know it or can do nothing about it. Through out my career as a Teamster my pay just went up a little over 3 times what it was at the start. Still decent money, but to see someone that was in management`s pay go up at a much higher rate than the average worker over the same period? Because he could con you he was worth more? Not many have shown it to me.  Sure if the auto companies restarted with new employees at a 25 percent pay cut they would get help, 20 bucks an hour is better than 10 or minimum wage.  Not everyone wants to run a company, be a doctor or a lawyer, attend college for 4 to 8 years, does that make them stupid? The old saying too many cooks? Too much competition in your field will make you easily replaceable, and for less money."

I am on my 5th Mazda, of which the last two were built in Detroit, and never had a single complaint about any of them. Why can North American auto workers build good vehicles for Japanese owners, but not to the same standard for North American owners?  A friend of mine has worked at Honda in Alliston for a good 10 years and says that the CAW guys are always at the employee entrance pushing their agenda. He said that nobody shows any sign of interest because they are all well treated and paid fairly for the work that they perform. Interesting  Lastly, I have a real hard time hearing that some of the workers at the big 3 are making 70K plus per year! Wow, most people do not make that kind of money these days without a university degree. Is it any wonder why the big 3 are in trouble? How can they compete when the cost of labour is so high? Why aren't people willing to take huge pay cuts in order to help make their company more competitive and stay afloat?"

No, I do not think they should be bailed out.  However, if they don't get bailed out, the ripple effect will be devastating.  If the gov't does give them 400 million or whatever the amount is, it should only be conditional on a guaranteed reimbursement plan over x amount of years or don't bother.

Revamp all their dealers and start serving their customers as customers and not low life suckers.  Give their workers a choice of company incentives or a union.

267351,sirfish,2008-11-14 08:10:00,175,"  Finally someone with some insight as to what will happen if any of the ""big 3"" fail. Most of you have no idea the catastrophic fallout if this happens. As it stands right now the job ratio is  1 to 8 . That s right. For every 1 job lost in the auto sector it means 8 others directly or indirectly will be downsized to the EI line. When this happens I don't want to hear you all say why didn't the government step in as you waddle down to the EI office.  If the collapse in fact happens it will imperil the foriegn imports as well . By this I mean that if the big three go then all the outside small part supliers will be closing thier doors as well and alot of them supply foreign auto makers also. So where will they get their parts???  The big 3 are their bread and butter, the foreign crap is a minute part of it. So there will be an imminent failure there as well . Then there will be some one to to emerge to supply parts at a higher cost cause it got them by the balls. What that translates into is a higher cost on a foreign car. Hmmm ......that leads us to higher auto prices again. we have come around once again. Fact: 1% of all profits from the sale of a Toyota stays in canada . How many jobs does this translate into?? Fact: in Korea 99% of vehicles sold are produced there. The other 1% are the sum of all other auto makers. Fact: Korea exports more vehicles to North America than are sold there in a year. Fact: Toyota pays it workers in North America the same as the big 3 and they are not unionized. Fact: 6% of the cost of a ""big3"" vehicle is labour.  6% !!!!!! Fact: without unions ,whats to stop all manufacturing from going offshore? I could go on. You can all bash the union all you want but without them many of you would not live the life you live today. They have set guidline standards . Without them companies would be paying slave wages. There would be no safety standards. YOU would have no rights as a worker. There are numerous police and fire men on this board Lets hear what they think about unions....Lew, Can. Copper ??  If you haven't figured it out yet I work for one of the ""big3"".  There seems to be an age old ""misconception""out there about auto workers. About how they are fat,lazy,overpaid,card playing,paper reading,cigarette smoking, coffee drinkers. This in part would have been true...10yrs ago.  Today with lean manufacturing taking over ,you punch in and go to your job , you hear a bell,you go on the line.Next bell you get a 10min break. Next bell you get a 23min lunch.Next bell you get a 10min.break. Next bell you go home. Now if my shift started at 6:30 am and finished at 2:30 pm that gives me a total of ...43 min out of an 8hr day to take a piss or two and have a lunch. Yup, we are definately overpaid and underworked. Give me a break. I could pick 20 people off this board and take them to work with me and put them on the line . 10 of you wouldn't last the week!!! . The other 10 that stay will be screaming for thier union rep every day.  So before you all go off on unions. Take a look around. If the government doesn't step in with a plan..an estimated  1 in 10 families will feel the fallout....You could be the ""1""  remember,  being this is a public forum we all have our opinion. nonone is right or wrong. lets keep it real."

Because its going to always have problems  And Yea I would go nuts pushing a button, but wow the pay is great.  Whats your Union doing for you when you loose your Job.  Betcha you go to the government for some kind of help while your Union Fat Cat doesnt worry about his job."

267368,mistyriver1,2008-11-14 12:59:00,600," Brian, I worked for GM for 20 years, does that qualify me to give an opinion ?  Firstly on worked on the finance side where there was no union, so please don't start bashing me about the union stuff as you did a couple of years ago.  As of the end of September, I received a severance package and am now unemployed.  Do I blame the unions ...NO.  The biggest thing that started this decline was the sub prime mortgage business in the US.  Too many people were approved for homes they could not afford and now these homes have been foreclosed and are being sold for bargain basement prices.  MANY companies and banks were guilty of this and are now paying the price.  Did the big three cause gas prices to skyrocket this summer ?  NO, This led to a quick shift in consumer demand away from trucks and sport utility vehices, something that the big three made their bread and butter on.  Let's not forget the legacy costs these three companies have....I'll tell you what, in 20 years when folks start retiring from Honda, Toyota, they are gonna have these costs too, something they don't have right now.  Don't get me wrong, there are alot of things that are wrong and need to be addressed with GM and the big three. Maybe with some government intervention this will wake them up.   In all my years there, I always believed GM was a very reactive company and not proactive.  However, to sit hear and say let em go down, is absolutely ridiculous.  There are 250,000 people employed by GM in the US alone and millions of people working for the suppliers to GM.  You think things are bad now, if they don't at least try to help them through this, you ain't seen nothing yet. How about the dealer network ?  Do you think that letting Georgian or Paul Sadlon go out of business would be a good idea.  Both are pretty active in the Barrie community from what I see.  How about Edmonds ?  Sirfish, I commend you on your post."

I work and get paid for what I know I stand on my own 2 feet and i am not covered by a collective blanket which makes me the same as everyone else. I ve been there and left because i could'nt handle the whining from the canine fornicators. dont get me wrong has some good points but not for me . Here is what i think the government is at fault for alot ,allowing so much foriegn crap on shore it should be even in/out no exceptions. housing as far as im concerned is out of control I really dont care if my house gets a profit as long as i get back what went into it im happy. I will never not be able to get by unless you cripple me The 3 emigos have had alot of years to adjust you cant tell me they didnt see the writing on the wall along time ago but they still make mustangs challengers and cameros what the heck.  i know it will effect alot of people but natural selection dictates the week will die (one of the big 3 maybe all) Ive got alot of poop rolling around in my head as to how and why and what. And if I can I try never to buy anything foreign(I do own a toyota and soley for the reason that it is better then anything produced on our shores I make no appologies for that)  All i can say is starp in stay low and hang on  JM2cents of babling Peter"
267371,OhioFisherman,2008-11-14 13:42:00,6623,"I was a Union worker all my adult life, different industry, Trucking though.  The auto companies (Exec`s) lobbied for years to block increases in the mileage standards it wasn`t in their interest to produce smaller cars with better gas mileage. Make 6000 per copy selling a SUV or 500 selling a caviler?  They took money they could have used to upgrade their plants and built new plants overseas. What is going to work better a 60 year old plant or a new one?  The executives had no problem raising the own pay and perks while all of this was going on, instant millionaires and the appointed their buddies who would back them to the boards.  Congress here in the states sat back and did nothing, no stronger consumer protection laws to protect the buyer from faulty or poorly designed cars. No stopping the push for bigger fuel hogs, even after the fuel shortage problems of the last 30+ years.  1 in 10 jobs here is estimated to be auto industry related, think the economy is bad now? Allow those plants to close! Allow those people not to have an income to keep the economy running.  Unions to blame? I don`t see it that way, greed. The execs want to raise their pay, American workers are among the most productive in the world, slave labor, breaking unions to cover their mistake allows them to keep raking in the cash.  Granted the foreign auto makers here in the states pay a decent wage, but who set the standard? will it continue when or if US auto makers are gone?  Is there a reason an Auto company exec now makes 30 times what they used to? When their employee`s pay has only gone up 4 times in the same period? Sure can`t be because they know what they are doing. 4.6 million dollar yearly retirement for a failed exec?  A union is the voice of the people, with out them all the politicians hear is the employers lobbyists. Certainly not down with all of some unions moves, but just as certainly not down with the moves of employers and politicians!  How do you call free trade fair? A bribe to a politician in China, Mexico, India allows you do what you want, pay what you want? Why do you think industry keeps pushing for more immigration? Flood the market with lower paid foreign workers! It drives down every ones wages!  People have stopped buying Detroit iron, more the exec`s, politicians fault than the auto workers. Still haven`t seen a car I would pay 20 grand for, and never owned a foreign car. 100 years or so of making cars in America and the can`t get an intake manifold or head gasket right? Not the auto workers fault, you do what the tell you to do.  The Chevy Volt save GM? not at 40 grand a pop, nobody will have jobs to buy them. Would you like fries with that?"

267382,Headhunter,2008-11-14 14:20:00,5703,"Here's my problem with the bail outs... how can you justify this scenario? A workin guy is making say $15/hr, has a job, works hard every day. Now, the government wants his tax dollars to bail out a bunch of folks who are used to making $75.00/hr, because they got greedy and made many mistakes? Looking a few years down the road, this working guy gets a letter saying they are closing the mills, he's gonna be out of work. Who contributed to this decision? The dude who got the bail out dough!!!!! Talk about a kick in the nuts with a frozen mukaluk! HH"
267395,eye-tracker,2008-11-14 15:03:00,89," I try not to comment on this stuff as I am a business man and a corporate executive,  Honda and Toyota announced today they also want a Provincial and Federal bailout...so much for only the BIG 3  Look this is going to be the hardest times many North Americans have ever seen as many have paid into corporate pensions, these will also disappear when the companies go under. I think if the government offers any bailout to any company the Officers (CEO, COO, CFO, CTO etc.) of the company should be fired, made to pay back all bonuses and be replaced with regular waged government workers to manage the company and  our tax payers bailout money.  This has all happen by greed and thanks to North American Corporation laws that allow company executives to get rich off the markets and share holders - all at the expense of employees.  Lets hope corporations can keep going, we just need some new laws to prevent this from happening in the future and the first place to start is publicly traded companies and new corporate laws.  -sheldon"
267401,bigfish1965,2008-11-14 15:24:00,3382,Since the big 3 do not have the same benefit costs here as the US we may see more jobs coming this way. Retirees cost them less here because of OHIP and seniors drug plans. It is the legacy costs which are crippling the auto makers. Supply and demand as well as product will decide if their vehicles sell.
267403,dp3200,2008-11-14 15:27:00,31,"I think the death of the big 3 will be fantastic for our progress.  I went to university, did a BA and an MBA, and graduated making barely more than a line worker. When I finished highschool, lots of my friends talked about university like it was for suckers.... why would they go, when their dad/uncle/mom/whatever can get them in at GM making 75K and having no student loan? Unions are a disincentive for people to better themselves. They protect people who otherwise have no skills that would make them competitive.  I am not speaking out against the middle class. I am part of it. I come from a GM neighborhood. But seriously - no skills, no education, nothing. And they are in the top 1% of earners in the world? Why should an 'average' worker be better off than 99% of the world's population? Who in their right mind actually thinks it's sustainable?  I'm not even going to start on the management... the garbage car - ridiculous union combination is just deadly in this case.  At the end of the day for our economy to survive, let alone thrive, we need to move on from 'average' industries. Manufacturing jobs are not something that the leading economies of tomorrow will be relying on."

267417,cram,2008-11-14 16:43:00,1733,"One of the posters referenced all the part shops that depend on the auto industry, and how most of the parts are american cars and only a minute part for foreign cars.......and how the american car companies going down would hurt the parts business -- ding ding ding...we have a winner!!!!!!)  Anyway, 1 in 7 jobs in Ontario dependent on the auto industry -- that's scary.  Really scary.  Yikes.  I don't know what the solution is.  Regardless of unions, the companies are sinking.  The demand for their cars are seriously dropping.  I assume part of this is due to gas prices, another part due to durability (yes, they ARE made to break down), and a whole bunch of other things we aren't discussing on this board.  Yere is a massive healthcare cost associated with all the US autoworker retirees.  That liability alone is sinking the companies.   Apparently it costs almost 3k per car sold to pay for that alone.   If the US adopted universal healthcare, that's a good start.  I don't know that the unions have anything to do with their competitiveness (esp if toyota/honda are payign teh same wages), but i do know its sickening to hear about people who can show up drunk for work and not get reprimanded (or fired).   The thing i don't like about unions is how they lift up the weak and hold down the strong.  If you're a good hardworking guy who is always held in the same bucket as the drunk who pushes the rules and relies on the union blanket.....that must suck."

267427,Pondo,2008-11-14 17:18:00,36,You can all bash the union all you want but without them many of you would not live the life you live today. They have set guidline standards . Without them companies would be paying slave wages. There would be no safety standards. YOU would have no rights as a worker.  What about WSIB?  Or the Canadian Labour Code?  Unions may certainly have contributed to their progress but they are now law.  I think the day has come and gone for unions in this country.

267274,jediangler,2008-11-14 01:38:00,1923,"Last time I checked, the unions weren't in charge of designing crappy cars that have decades old technologies. The OLD 3, we must stop calling them BIG, have been falling farther and farther behind. Even if they give them a cash boost, the thousands of workers they have eliminated won't ever buy their cars again. While we are on the subject, buying used North American cars does not give you the right to harass those who prefer quality cars made elsewhere. You are not supporting anything but your local used car dealer. I work in the auto industry heat treating 3.0L Ford V6 aluminum engine blocks that haven't changed in 3 years. I'm in the CAW and I don't make enough money to buy a new car, unless it was made in South Korea. I drive a 15 year old Lexus and a 12 year old Toyota.

The Big 3 have for years enjoyed living high off the hog with their sales through the roof.  The auto workers enjoying high salaries as they have a strong union and now the union can not be of any help.  Misfish I am with you on this one. Let the Big 3 take a tumble there will be others that will fill the void and work hard to become the big name in the auto industry. I could not afford a new truck and I happy driving my 1998 F150 4X4 with 340,000 kms and no rust as I have been taking care of it.  This truck is paid for and now is worth nothing on the market and really I don not need a new truck now.  Maybe a bigger boat for my truck to pull.  Unfortunately there will be many without employment and that is terrible. Their unions have done that to them. I see the economy has needing a big correction just like in the stock markets where there has been many increases and then a huge correction was required to bring them back in line.  I know that my business has suffered as a result of the high gas prices and parity with the US dollar all summer preventing anglers from coming into the Quinte area to fish. I wonder if the government will bail me out......NOT!  There will be many tumbles from this economy slow down as our area also runs auto industry parts etc. and those plants are either closing down or close to it.

The more the company raises the prices the more the penny should be divied up and spread out, not just lining the pockets of the CEO's and such. If the unions didn't fight for more then they wouldn't get more. On the same note the more the unions get the higher the price passed on to the consumer will be. Ultimately this has come to a head and now consumers can't afford to pay what the going price is because of job loss and lack of raises and inflation driving the market so far out of wack that....well here we are crapping out and no work and no money. How are we supposed to survive if something doesn't give. Giving the big handouts to corporations is not the way to fix the mess we got ourselves into. Nor is bailing out the consumers high credit cards, mortgages and debt. Why don't they stop some of the exports of oil and keep our own economy in check. Look after our own country for a change. In my opinion lowering rates and keeping gas prices a lot lower then they are might help us to recover from the mess we are in."
