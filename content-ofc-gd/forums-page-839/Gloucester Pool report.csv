346718,Rizzo,2009-06-01 01:19:00,4754,"Went to Gloucester Pool Saturday for the first time (thanks Misfish for directions to the launch). After launching in Little Lake we headed straight upstream. All kinds of structure up there...drop-offs, shoals, weedy bays, points, saddles, islands, rapids, trees, docks...you name it. Too bad we only had half the day to explore! Water was approx 60 degrees. We got a few decent pike in the 27-30 inch range, more in the 20-24 hammerhandle range, and some OOS bass. The real kicker is I didn't bring an OFC logo because we caught a walleye that had to be pushing 10 pounds. My buddy took a photo but we didn't actually measure it...either way, it was size large. Other than a walleye I caught last fall trolling a 13 inch custom crankbait (thanks Robin), it is the biggest 'eye I have ever seen. All fish were released. I'm hoping someone from Team 9 goes to the Bay of Quinte, because other than there, I don't think that unmeasured, ""un-logo picture taken"" fish will be beat! If my friend sends the photo within the next few days I'll post it. Those dang pesky walleye just won't leave me alone...I had actually commented about my ""pesky walleye"" problem last week when someone else brought up Gloucester Pool and how it is not the place to go to target 'eyes...somehow they manage to find me."
347494,Rizzo,2009-06-02 22:02:00,4754,"So I got the photo. We were after pike, and ended up getting this fish as well. Caught on an x-rap 14 along a drop off outside of what we thought was a ""piky-looking"" spawning bay.  "
347498,BillM,2009-06-02 22:03:00,17367,"Good job man!  I am glad you ignored my advice to hit Gbay, lol"
347499,alphaalpha,2009-06-02 22:06:00,475,congrat's on one of your best 'eyes! sounds like a great day on the water
347503,Spiel,2009-06-02 22:11:00,9065,"Beauty Walleye.    An outstanding fish anywhere, anytime. Good on you for releasing it."
347507,Rizzo,2009-06-02 22:17:00,4754," haha actually that advice was to someone else who was thinking about going to Gloucester Pool I think. In that same thread I had commented that if the walleye fishing was that bad there, I should go because I don't care for them. They fight like a wet blanket! We actually had another eye (3-4 pounder) to the side of the boat that we lost...no matter, it wasn't worth a photo and would have been released anywho!"
347562,BillM,2009-06-03 00:11:00,17367,"I might PM you for some specifics, the oldman is a pickerel lover   Haven't hooked one yet out on Gloucester.  Bass, pike, musky.... no pickerel."
347573,steverowbotham,2009-06-03 00:48:00,1800,nice. I've never seen an eye like that outta GPool
347595,Mike the Pike,2009-06-03 01:29:00,3421,Lok on the bright side at least this time you caught it when you were not targetting Muskie.  Nice fish Bud
347604,Rizzo,2009-06-03 02:00:00,4754,guaranteed if I actually target a pickerel someday i will get skunked. I guess I just fluke them out middle of the day under bright blue skies!
347634,Greencoachdog,2009-06-03 02:41:00,8163,Do you know how many Wall-ice Parfaits and Flambes that fish would've made???
