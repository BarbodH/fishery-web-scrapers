347700,Devious,2009-06-03 11:21:00,49,Got out fishing this weekend with my buddy jeff up at his cottage and got into the pike again...this season has been awesome so far.   This is the only pic I have from sat as Jeff didnt send me the others....our big fish each this day was around 6lbs  Now....I went home sat night and the next morning I got a call from Jeff saying he got into a dandy....here it is      13lbs 2oz....and he even managed to get decent pics by himself in the boat!
347701,Roy,2009-06-03 11:29:00,13728,Nice report McMurphy. Some dandies there for sure.  A hint for you if you're going to be releasing those pike. Give the fish some support under the belly....takes a lot of the stress off the backbone and inards.  Thanks for posting.
347709,splashhopper,2009-06-03 11:46:00,2931, Yeah... kinda like how Roy is holding the fish in his profile pic ?
347720,Devious,2009-06-03 12:14:00,49,Sorry guys....ill keep that in mind for the future I wasn't aware it put that much stress on the fish.
347725,johnnyb,2009-06-03 12:25:00,3413,"Nice fish in those shots...welcome aboard, McMurphy!  Any idea what the lengths were on 'em?"
347737,Devious,2009-06-03 12:44:00,49," Thanks johnny, no idea on the lengths unfortunately"
347758,Greencoachdog,2009-06-03 13:11:00,8163,"Some real nice Gators there!!!  I don't know if the vertical hold matters that much, it's only for a few seconds while the pic is being taken and the only thing I've found about it is the fish tend to poop on your boat more... there are some ""purists"" on this board that are vehemently against the vertical hold and may some flack about pics of large fish being held vertically.  Posting a fishes weight on this board can be an invitation to insults and bickering.... especially with Pike and Musky, posting the length in inches is a much better way to go.  Thanks for posting that nice Pike porn!!!"
347765,Mike Pike,2009-06-03 13:33:00,1332,"Wow, you guys really got into some good ones there!  Congratz.  Must have been a thrill!"
347787,Zubris21,2009-06-03 14:18:00,563,"Nice healthy looking gators there!  Thanks for taking the time to post.  We're not trying to scare you away or anything, but like the others have said, vertical holds can get to a few people around here.  Hopefully this doesn't discourage you from posting though, because we love to see fish porn!"
