Started 3:30pm as a stress relief exercise from my hard work finishing my basement. Fished until 7pm. Got 5 Kings...biggest 16 Lbs 14Ozs, the rest under 10 Lbs. Lost two other fish one of which was good size. Smaller Kings came on the 6 colors leadcore, the big ones on the rigger 150 feet down in 170 fow. Green/Black, Michael Jackson and Black/silver. Spoons only. Here are few shots from the day for your viewing pleasure. Had to use my Blackberry as I forgot my camera at home.:  The biggest one:   One of the smaller ones:   And this hitchhiker came with the big King. It was its last voyage though as I used my pliers on it's head.    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
