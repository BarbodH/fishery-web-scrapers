347504,wjw,2009-06-02 22:12:00,35,A few years ago I added clear safety glasses to the list of items I take up to Canada for my spring trip. I use them when heading back to the cabin near dark. I fish in an open boat powered by a Honda 25hp motor. Periodically I would get wacked in the eye by a black fly and have a miserable ride back. The safety glasses have eliminated that problem.

347203,Fishnwire,2009-06-02 02:48:00,983,"Another OFNer started a thread about top 5 lures.  I mentioned that in addition to my ""must-have"" baits, I consider a decent pair a needle nose (for ease of hook removal) to be something I really prefer not to do without.  Most have a cutting section for your line and you can bend a hook back into shape with them.  I prefer not to throw a cast unless I have them on hand.  Anyway, what do you guys consider an essential piece of equipment to have on the boat seat, front section of your tackle bag, in your pocket, etc?...That tool or item you always like to have within arm's reach.  Cold beer is a valid answer, but let's not waste a lot of thread-space on the obvious."
347209,tdotfisherman,2009-06-02 03:04:00,317,"I'd say that some essential fishing tools/tackle for me would be pliers, jaw spreaders, bait cast setup, camera, gloves, tangle-free net, flashlight, and a pack of smokes"

Hemostats are 100 times more practical then pliers... IMHO... cause you can just clip them on your clothing somewhere and you always have them. Nail clippers for cutting line,cause my teeth just don't cut it anymore.A hand towel cause the only thing worse then cold hands is cold WET HANDS. And finally something  to keep me hydrated, which is a jug of water most of the time but in the winter it is usually a thermos of homemade soup.  Others things I bring regularly but the above things I ALWAYS bring."

I hated that I put all those fish through the added stress for nothing. I guess this could fall under the emergency toilet paper as well.

347291,muddler,2009-06-02 12:12:00,623,"Good Post.  I thought about all my tackle bags, boxes and vests and there are three things I NEVER go fishing without.  1. Line nipper or a finger nail clipper. I put these on a retractable pin on when stream fishing other wise put it on a dollar store lanyard. Easy to find and I can wear it when the action gets hot. 2. Long nose pliers or a hemostat. Depends if I'm walking or in a a boat. 3. Small first aid kit. Nothing can wreck a days fishing than a little nick that bleeds all over the place. Great for kids too.  Nexcare (lawlaws and Independant stores) makes a 5 pack that has just what I need for little emergencies. Each is a foldable organized pouch tha has 7 sections  with a good variety of sizes of bandaids. Fold it an put it into a zip lock bag and forget it until you need it.  All else depends where I go and for how long. Most of the time I go for  less than an hour so just the needed tackle and the above essentaila will do.  muddler"
347483,JoshS,2009-06-02 21:28:00,729,SMOKES!  ahah.. pathetic.  Always like to have my polarized with me to see follows b/c it builds my confidence to see that fish are somewhat interested and maybe tells me its time to switch it up.  And a bottle of water.
347485,Spiel,2009-06-02 21:33:00,9065,"Something new for me the last couple of years that I can not go fishing without is a pair of 2.50 magnifying glasses, without 'em I aint tying my line to nada!"
