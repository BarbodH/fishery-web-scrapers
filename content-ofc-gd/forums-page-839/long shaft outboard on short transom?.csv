347591,ch312,2009-06-03 01:24:00,1590,im looking for a motor for my boat and apparently i should use a short shaft motor with this boat. what difference would it make if i used a long shaft motor instead of the short?
347597,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-03 01:31:00,947,using a longer shaft on a shorter transom will create unnecessary drag on your outboard lower unit and reduce overall performance to your boat.  Using a short shaft on a longer transom will mean your outboard will not have enough drag in the water to operate properly in turns and high speeds.
