347480,Silo Buster,2009-06-02 21:20:00,81,"Jr. and I headed down to West lake Willows for a couple days of fishing.Had a great time as usual.A ton of Oos fish but thats just the way it goes..Ended up with 5 pike ,18 Crappie,33 oos largies and endless rock bass.Oh and a half dozen perch. "

347500,Rizzo,2009-06-02 22:06:00,4754,Guess I can only speak for myself but if I tied into that many out of season fish I'd move!
347534,johnnyb,2009-06-02 22:58:00,3413,Wow...seems like the crappie are really taking off in West Lake...too bad you didn't tie into any walleye...sounds like you had fun though
347583,Silo Buster,2009-06-03 01:04:00,81," Its not like we were targeting the oos fish.Every oos fish caught was released.I don't take my son out of school for 2 days to teach him that.We never anchored once,it just so happened that targeting pike and walleye, they(oos fish) seemed to be every where.All over Westlake."
347586,Rizzo,2009-06-03 01:16:00,4754,"oh man, I wish my dad had taken me out of school to go fishing. Actually, my dad wasn't a fisherman, so we didn't go fishing school or no school! Is this west Lake with the sand dunes? I used to fish there many years ago...and if they had a few more musky in there I'd probably go back some day"
347592,Mike the Pike,2009-06-03 01:25:00,3421,Sounds like lots of action junior must have been pleased.

347596,Rizzo,2009-06-03 01:30:00,4754,glad to hear things are still good out that way. I remember fishing east lake as well...was like shooting fish in a barrel some days
