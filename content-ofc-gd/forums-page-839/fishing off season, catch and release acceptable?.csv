347451,JohnF,2009-06-02 19:52:00,3494," By that reasoning I'm not fishing if I don't catch anything, just wading down the creek beating the air with a graphite stick.  JF"

347535,Jigger,2009-06-02 22:59:00,1237,"Knowingly targeting fish is illegal when they aren't in season. However, theres plenty of lures that have multiple species written all over them and incidental catches are going to happen. As far as spawning fish go, fishing spawning trout and Salmon is legal and by far the most popular time of year to target them. Fishing Pike in spawning bays when the season opens yields the years biggest fish on average. Its just easier to fish your target when its spawning whether you want to call it shooting fish in a barrel or whatever. But I guarantee you that if the water doesn't warm up fast enough, you'll see male bass being hauled off beds left right and center come opener. Doesn't mean its right, just legal. The bigger fish wont be in those same spots, but it will be the people that refuse to work a little harder and that will be content with quantity over quality fishing these spots. Why? Easy pickins. This weekends musky opener has spawning written all over it too if the temps are still on the mild side."
347640,Rich,2009-06-03 02:50:00,3927,"Yeah, our lakes can't possibly sustain a year round bass season. Much better off to tow the boat to the other side of the Niagara River and do it over there. After all, the bass on that side of the river have a year round growing season.  I'm not advocating OOS bass fishing, but I would definitely advocate a change in bass season here in Ontario.  I've always said what would be best is keeping it open until the beginning of April, then closing from April til end of June. That would sufficiently protect bedding bass."

Personally, the pike/ walleye opener should extend 2 weeks later, but that won't fly with the tourism industry. I 'm happy they have finally closed pike in Niagara. It was also still legal here to net them a few years back, and they were easy pickings during the spawn."
347286,River Rat,2009-06-02 11:44:00,161,"targeting OOS fish is wrong but.............. it happens all the time. I'm sure it does damage to the fishery but most fish are released as the fines are high.  The worst influence I have seen on the fishery in the last ten years (other than invasive species) is the internet. Poachers are one thing but when a guy posts tons of pictures showing backgrounds (of rivers specificaly) saying ""double digit drop backs right here on thursday"" ...and the post comes on Friday, you should see the number of fish that are taken out legally that weekend.....2000 to 4000 hits a day people!  I've seen it 100 times on rivers, on ice and even open water lakes. Cell phones, navionics chips and the internet are the real threat.....poachers have become a secondary problem IMO.  RR"

Bass season opens the 19th of June here in zone 8 of Quebec. Berkley are having the B-1 tournament and called it for the 19th which gives the participants no time for a prefish. Berkley was able to secure prefish for the tournament starting the 15th of June. Money talks and Bull walks as they say. Pros 'playing' the tourney have gone down in my esteem (not that they care I know)....the QMNR just confirmed what I think of them in the first place and, I will never, ever buy another berkley product again. There's a whole lot to this story but I'll leave it at that.

347324,Moosebunk,2009-06-02 13:08:00,3970,"Good point Roy.  On a personal note...  Caught a few OOS smallies this past winter.  Four guys, 8 holes, spread right out in depths from 4 to 18 feet.  One of my holes gets 3 OOS smallies, big suckers too.  Best smallie outing I've ever had.  Meanwhile, the other guys holes not twenty feet away are firing walleye.  Am I moving?... no way.  Later caught 3 walleye too out of the smallie hole and missed some fish.  Wasn't there targeting bass but I feel it's absurd to pass on a great fishing area because OOS fish are being hooked 1 to 4 to the target species.  Scenarios like this have happened other times as well... heck, I caught 2 OOS sturgeon recently while using deadbait tactics to take 12 (I think it was) mixed bag walleye and pike at locations where all those fish swim.  Also catch most of my ice-out pike at warm water outflows where OOS walleye may be lurking as well.  Fishing in-season fish is allowable but I wonder what a CO would have said about some of these cases...?  The bass season IMO isn't right.  This fish on a pedestal is absurd.  The ""slow"" growth for these fish compared to U.S. fish means nothing, as, it applies to pretty much all of our countries sportfish.  Walleye and trout across the province need to be stocked yet they're seasons allow ice fishing and much shorter closures.  Bass are open year round in some parts of Northern Ontario where bass are fewer and farther between, so why in the south do they close this fish?"
347326,Greencoachdog,2009-06-02 13:19:00,8163,  Because 90% of the Canadian population is huddled around the border trying to stay warm and the fishing pressure would be too great.
347330,Moosebunk,2009-06-02 13:28:00,3970," GCD, that same 90% picks at the other species which now need to be stocked in many border lakes and rivers.  Maybe for a few years they should alleviate pressure on those fish by giving them the same elite closures as bass...???"
347331,Raf,2009-06-02 13:28:00,3495,"nobody fishes bass in northern ontario. 90% of the population is close to the US border and have somehow been manipulated into thinking that bass is a prized fish.     their popularity lies with the fact that they are an easy to catch oversized panfish easily accessible to many which paints a huge bullseye on them.  they also mean big buck$ to the industry (tournaments, sponsors etc).. so 'we' need to protect this 're$ource'."
347332,Moosebunk,2009-06-02 13:29:00,3970,"Or, open bass to icefishing to help the other species."
347337,Fishnwire,2009-06-02 13:37:00,983,"Bass is closed pretty much all winter right up until the end of June up north here in Sudbury.  I'm not aware of anywhere near me where it is open all year round.  I personally would try to avoid taking OOS bass during breeding, even at the expense of decent legal in-season fishing.  I hate like hell to pull a big breeder off it's nest this time of year.  Knowing I've almost certainly doomed it's precious clutch of eggs is pretty hard to take.  That said...I'm not really sure why SMB is closed in the winter, so I wouldn't have moved off that walleye bite if I was you either.  Catching smallies through the ice like in the scenario you described is basically a fluke, and as such, pretty hard to avoid.  Guys ""accidentally"" catching big bass this time of year is a little harder to defend...More so if the kid is using a wacky worm, or other bass-obvious bait."
347342,Roy,2009-06-02 13:41:00,13728," You got that right, Raf. Bass were/are considered a garbage fish in the north...as are pike in lots of areas. Why do you think there's a catch limit of 10 muskies in NB with no minimum size?"
347344,Headhunter,2009-06-02 13:42:00,5703,"I agree with Bunk... I don't see any really viable reason why we have a closed season for bass. Small mouth being an invasive species not with standing, I think there are more than enough bass in this province to allow year round fishing. IMHO... let the flaming begin! HH"
347346,Fishnwire,2009-06-02 13:49:00,983," What?  Walleye is more popular, but there are plenty of guys who love to fish for smallies up here.  There's not much of a large mouth fishery to speak of, but there are plenty of bass fishermen."
347348,Raf,2009-06-02 13:52:00,3495,"sudbury <> northern ontario fishnwire.  i was thinking more along the lines of nw ontario, thunder bay, timmins etc.  typically the only people who fish bass up there are from southern ontario or americans."

347356,Fishnwire,2009-06-02 14:18:00,983,Gotcha Raf...I was thinking north of Barrie = northern.
347379,Jonny,2009-06-02 15:06:00,1380, There are no bass around Timmins (except stocked). The water temps stay too cool. To get into some decent bass from Timmins you have to go south to around the Gogama-Shining Tree area.  There are lots of people in the Sudbury - North Bay area who fish for bass... smallmouth.
347386,JohnF,2009-06-02 15:39:00,3494,Whether you like it or not we do in fact have seasons for bass in Ontario. Therefore to defend selectively ignoring the regs with which you disagree is to in fact defend all poaching.  Pro poaching - Is you is or is you ain't?  JF

347432,charlesn,2009-06-02 18:46:00,551," Raf, there is a flourishing bass fishery up there and 2 of the largest (and longest tenured) bass tournaments in Canada are in that region.  The KBI (Kenora Bass Invitational on Lake of the Woods) and the one out of Fort Frances (Rainy Lake something I think).  The communities really get involved and it's apparently a really big deal for up there.  If it wasn't so darn far, I'd love to drive my boat up there and test myself against those guys/gals.  However, from here it's a closer drive to Guntersville than Kenora...  Charles"

I DO NOT fish for OOS Bass but I see why some people do, 99.9% of the time there is no repercussion, as far as CO's. Its like saying don't jay walk because you'll get a ticket. I've been living and fishing in Ontario for 4 years and I have never seen a single CO in person, yet I pay a lot more for a liscence than I did when I lived in Florida. Give us some more CO's and just maybe people will have the fear of conservation put into them enough to stop poaching, just my two cents.  -Ben"
347065,fishingisliving,2009-06-01 23:24:00,170,"I was meeting a freind at a launch a few days ago, and met a man who was fishing with a big spinning rod, with bottom bouncer and a worm. I asked what he was fishing for:  -Sturgeon! -Aren't they out of season right now? -yeah but I just do catch and release so its ok. -really? seasons only mean you cant keep em, but you can still catch and release? -yeah for sure, my buddies were out bass fishing last week, now is the best time to catch the big ones! -really? so they catch a bunch of big ones this time of year? -oh big ones..  and lots of em too.   I saw a test filmed on tv once, where two guys wanted to prove that if you catch a bass off it's nest that it takes a long time for it to find its way back during which predators move in the take the eggs. In fact, one guy casted at the nest to catch it, while the other was underwater with a camera filming the bass. It took forever for the bass afterwards to make its way back to the nest.  that same day(in May), I saw a boat trolling 2 heavy rods with giant spinnerbaits at 4+ mph.  gee I wonder what he was fishing for... what's wrong with poachers? all you have to do is wait a couple extra weeks, then you can fish for your favourite species the whole summer! In the mean time, try and learn to catch other species!"
347072,Zubris21,2009-06-01 23:35:00,563,"I agree with you, targeting species out of season is unacceptable, and against the law.  C&R is not ok, exactly for the reason you mentioned, you completely disrupt their spawning behaviour/pattern, even if just for a short while.  Some will argue that in the case of bass there should be no closed limit, and well, I am no expert but I don't really see any benefit to it.  If anything, I would like to see more limitations put in fishing during the spawn, even for panfish."
347079,jediangler,2009-06-01 23:39:00,1923,"Some people can't catch them when it's legal. Too hard for them. They'll catch them out of season and take pictures and call them Personal Bests. Poachers Best, I say."

Now I myself caught a few OOS bass this year but in respect to that I was not targeting them and only wanted to capture a quick memory.  Aside from than, I was at Scugog with Profisher25 the other weekend for that little perch trip we did and I saw a teen heading to the causeway with 2 or 3 rods, one of them with a spinnerbait, the other with a soft plastic minnow(large). Kinda sad when people are catching bass that early in the year in water bodies are not warm and fish are at least post spawn.  The only thing I can do is to hope for more CO's to catch people fishing for OOS fish. And hopefully catching those that even keep them.    MTBF"

After an oddly unsuccessful afternoon of jigging for walleye and throwing for pike, we were packing our stuff up at the dock when I saw some little smallmouths in the shallows near the dock.  They were obviously not of breeding age, so I tied up a little tube and let my Bro toss it at 'em.  He instantly reeled in a quarter pounder...his first and probably last smallie ever, I took a quick pic for my neice (to prove her old man can fish) and tossed it back so it could resume chassing minnows in the reeds.

If it wasn't so sad it would be comical, one clown wearing a Shimano jacket was running around all happy as all get out with his 18""  ""5lb'er"" getting his surly wife to snap pics for 5 minutes, a few others are literally bouncing huge hooks with 1/2"" piece of worm off the faces of females on the nests.  When I pointed out the 10lb sheepshead cruising around one guy spent 30 seconds plopping his worm piece infront of it then went back to his ""easy"" bass.  Goobers.  You could literally see the gobies swarm the nest eating eggs every time one was pulled. Oh and FYI, bass don't eat when they're on the nest, or even after the fry hatch.  All that energy they waste when they're caught cuts down their chances of survival by a nice chunk.  And a mile away is some of the best carp fishing in S.Ontario right now.....but hey it's alot more fun to shoot fish in a barrel."

Because they feature shows where the tactics target pre and spawn bass, and it is not illegal in most states, the boobs expect they should and can do it here. Growth rates for a bass are double that of Ontario in the Southern states. A 5lb bass, in Ontario, is an old fish.  Not so in Florida, Georgia, etc..., so our rules and regs have to reflect differences. I do not believe in Monkey see monkey do.
