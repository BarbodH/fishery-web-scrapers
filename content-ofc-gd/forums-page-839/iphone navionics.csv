It has maps for G Bay, Kawarthas, Simco, Great Lakes, Niagra and more!!  Excellent value, a must for any angler with an iphone and maybe an alternative for the angler on a budget."
347176,GBW,2009-06-02 01:54:00,8460,D'OH!  I wonder if there is a blackberry version?

347497,Stoty,2009-06-02 22:02:00,2910,Purchased it this morning! Can't go wrong for $9.99!!
347549,CRAPPIE,2009-06-02 23:48:00,213,"Hi, Can you give me the exact name so I can find it in my iphone, been waiting for it and I cannot find it today Thanks in advance"
347550,medmart,2009-06-02 23:49:00,587, Hey Stoty where did you get it?  Rob
347554,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-03 00:00:00,947,You need an Iphone
347580,Steel28,2009-06-03 01:02:00,160,Got mine as well last week! Price is great.
347625,mistaredone,2009-06-03 02:34:00,913,Go to the App store then under search(bottom of screen) type in Navionics then scroll down to Great Lakes edition.  Enjoy. 
347710,Stoty,2009-06-03 11:47:00,2910, Exactly!
347714,Billy Bob,2009-06-03 11:58:00,5865,Here's a SPECIAL price for only $4.99.........  http://www.navionics.com/Newsletters/Navio...s_US_060109.htm
347716,Stoty,2009-06-03 12:07:00,2910,Hotmaps Canada is $4.99 Navionics Gold Great Lakes is $9.99
347745,CRAPPIE,2009-06-03 12:55:00,213,"I got different name from you guys, some of you said Navonics Great Lakes and some of you said Navonics Gold Great Lakes, which one is right? Thanks!"
347751,Stoty,2009-06-03 12:58:00,2910,"Gold Great Lakes in the App Store, but it shows up as Navionics Great Lakes on your phone."
347757,mistaredone,2009-06-03 13:08:00,913,Crappie I think your missing the I in navIonics.
347760,Yellow14,2009-06-03 13:26:00,29,Now all they need is the Apple iFish Finder USB attachment for the iPhone and I am all set.
347797,CRAPPIE,2009-06-03 14:30:00,213,what is Ifish finder USB ?is that another app for finding fish?
347800,Yellow14,2009-06-03 14:33:00,29,"As far as I know Apple hasn't invented the iFishfinder USB yet, but give them time. If they can make money from the idea it'll be out by Christmas."
347918,CRAPPIE,2009-06-03 18:39:00,213,For the Great Lake App. does it show the depth too ?
347944,mistaredone,2009-06-03 19:26:00,913,That's what it's all about
348160,adempsey,2009-06-04 05:48:00,1498,"Is this for iPhone only? or does it work with an iTouch?? I don't have either, but would consider an iTouch.   I just dropped $200 on maps for my portable GPS too =\"
348199,Stoty,2009-06-04 11:53:00,2910,"Wouldnt waste your money on an iTouch just for this app. You'll need an active internet connection in order to use the app. Unless your at home on a wireless connection, its pretty much useless. I guess you can plan out your trips, then bring it along for reference?"
