I'm sure I may run into jigger there but not sure if others are going.  If there are enough people going maybe we can do a M&G some time on Sat. or Sun. in the parking lot between Winchester and the beer tent just after lunch (AKA the hockey rink lot)?  Your thoughts?  Ok, Ok, I know someone is bound to say to do the M&G in the beer tent but that's just to easy... Cheers, Geoff"
