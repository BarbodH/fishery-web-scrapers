348115,Bob,2009-06-04 02:30:00,370,"The animal control guy we used to have here (before the MNR took the job back) was trapping 3 or 4 bears a week all over town.  He'd haul them a couple hours north of town and turn them loose but they were always back in 2 or 3 days.  Rumour has it, they're now hauling them south to see if they'll stay away from here."
348119,Jonny,2009-06-04 02:37:00,1380,"The Toronto Star had an item on this today. They accept comments, one of them being that we're destroying their habitat, poor things! So here's what I sent 'em:  "
348150,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-04 04:06:00,947,"It's funny to see this but at the same time very dangerous.  I can't count the number of times a city folk has tried to pet one of these or feed it, while the rest of us are running away"
348281,blaque,2009-06-04 14:57:00,2419,"How dangerous can they be, drifter you fish with these guys sniffin you up and down all the time dont you?   lol.  I dunno, a black bear, wouldnt scare me too much, as long as i dont try to ""pet him and feed him"" lol.....or i didnt startle him in the bush....it'd be them brown grizzlies that would have me wettin my pants."
348285,Viscount,2009-06-04 15:07:00,52,This is funny.. wait til the bears make their way to the south-western farmland or the Niagara vinyards and orchards... all prime habitat.
348289,LeXXington,2009-06-04 15:25:00,1928," Been doing my geography, All the houses and people hang out on ward / center / Algonquin island part of the Toronto islands.  ""Cormorants have overtaken a peninsula of Toronto's Leslie Street Spit, which, thanks to aggressive nest building, is barren but for one tree. (May 13, 2009)"" from the Toronto Star.  Now if the cormorants took over the Algonquin island where the houses are you thing they would all still be there."
347763,Governator,2009-06-03 13:31:00,879,"   Not sure if you guys saw, but on the news this morning a black bear made it to downtown Aurora and is now up in a tree.  It's in my grandaprents old backyard, they moved a few months ago.  Infact, my old apartment was right next to this yard and I grew up playing in it as I lived 1 block from them as a child.  I just found it kind of exciting.  How it made it's way to downtown Aurora, I have no idea.  There is a small conservation forest about 10min walk away called Shepherds Bush, I have a feeling it was in there."
347771,Joey,2009-06-03 13:42:00,9122,"Ya, I saw it on the news this morning.  Poor thing.  He was sure on the roam!  Joey"
347779,Roy,2009-06-03 14:05:00,13728,Nice pic.  A bear on the lam....sounds exciting.
347788,Governator,2009-06-03 14:18:00,879,"It was live on CP24 (Still is actually).  They tranquilized the bear in the tree, it slowly started coming down the tree and then fell about 20-30' in to a tarp that firefighters were holding.  It then wondered off and passed out in the yard.  I felt bad for the bear, but it was fun to watch and he wasn't hurt.  Looks like MNR did a great job."
347796,LeXXington,2009-06-03 14:28:00,1928,I say take the bear downtown toronto and let it on the toronto Islands that's where the most vocal people about leaving nature alone is.  Now if we could just get all the cormorants too all nest there too
347798,bassman,2009-06-03 14:31:00,384,"wow, there was a confirmed bear sighting in bradford a few weeks ago as well."
347834,CLofchik,2009-06-03 16:07:00,854,"There's been a few bears that have followed the Rouge R. valley all the way to Scarberia. Last year I was out and they had Twin Rivers Rd. closed hunting for a bear that was wandering the streets.  Hmmm, banning the Spring hunt is fine when bears are wandering downtown TBay or Owen Sound, but once they make it to Aurora it's a mad panic.  Funny that."
347835,big guy,2009-06-03 16:10:00,414,  It probably walked there
347842,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-03 16:20:00,10439,  Better yet drop it off in Queens Park and the mamby pamby polititions that cancelled the spring bear hunt can see what they have done first hand. Maybe set a couple of dozen loose in there and barr the doors while they are in session.
347844,wuchikubo,2009-06-03 16:30:00,1114, They should do that with all the raccoons too. Maybe that would make a dent in the cormorant population.
347846,solopaddler,2009-06-03 16:46:00,8605," Exactly, then release cougars to take care of the racoons."
347848,shane,2009-06-03 16:52:00,652,Maybe we need a 'bear tax' to keep the bears away.
347851,Roy,2009-06-03 17:01:00,13728, Then release the barflies to take care of the cougars.
347852,Raf,2009-06-03 17:03:00,3495,lol Roy.  I prefer Manthers.
347862,holdengr,2009-06-03 17:23:00,3,What a circus......I'm gonna call the news the next time a bear walks across my yard. Any guesses on their reaction?
347877,solopaddler,2009-06-03 17:44:00,8605, Manthers? That's a new one for me HAHAHA!
347923,highdrifter,2009-06-03 18:54:00,2534,Bugs must be starting to get bad...  Every year or so we get a stray moose wander close to the town limits and freak out the local fisherman!!  Manthers...  Shweeeeet..  I'm taking that one to the bank!!
347942,blaque,2009-06-03 19:24:00,2419,"Down here in the Buffalo area, we had a black bear hit on the 190 last week. Literally just outside the city. And another a fair bit south of the city.  Bears hit in and around buffalo ny"
347969,LeXXington,2009-06-03 20:19:00,1928, Don't worry that was not a bear from Canada it has no pockets to carry a passport..
347980,blaque,2009-06-03 20:53:00,2419," lol, he may have swam at night and avoided customs all together.  I think one of three things happened. Either it made the trek up, and i mean TREK.......from the southern tier.......OR someone has intervened here. Either hit it down toward the Pa. line and thought it would be funny to plant it in an extremely urban area to stir things up. OR some idiot thought it would be fun to have a bear cub as a pet and let it go when it was getting to grown to handle. The one right near the city was a 1-1/2 year old cub. I dunno, maybe im thinking crazy, but neither of those thoughts are crazier than a bear migrating up from the Pa/Ny border into Buffalo. lol"
347991,siwash,2009-06-03 21:39:00,683,  Where've you been? that IS where all the cormorants nest! one of the largest colonies on the Great Lakes
348008,tjsa,2009-06-03 22:22:00,1578," Yeah, us up here in the Great White North always chuckle at bear siting posts from southern Ontario, and the generation of posts and news reports that follow. Its commonplace up here, even before the spring bear hunt was canceled. We have a lot of green space directly bordering us, and our city,.Thunder Bay is built up following the shoreline of Lake Superior. Some new development areas are backing onto green space, and as such, animals wander in at times. Its not uncommon for one bear to have multiple reports from those areas to have calls into the BearWise hotline. It is one bear, walking along the treeline at the edge of those peoples back yards, just going wherever it wants to go, yard to yard, not doing anything, not destroying anything, not threatening anything, but, people see it, and panic sets in. I quite frankly find it hilarious. Too bad the MNR bear techs have to deal with the multiple calls for just one bear just roaming around at the edge of a green space."
348013,musky66,2009-06-03 22:31:00,273,I grew up in Aurora as well- caught many beautiful Speckled trout at Shepherds Bush!
348096,rickster,2009-06-04 02:05:00,495,common occurence here  now if was wrasslin a saskamaquatch it might make the news here
348110,splashhopper,2009-06-04 02:27:00,2931,"I just found it kind of exciting.  How it made it's way to downtown Aurora, I have no idea.
