I don't do it very often so I just use whatever bar soap is laying around.  This summer I'm laid off for eight weeks and plan on being there a lot.  I'll want to take more than a couple of baths over the season, but don't want to pollute the river with all that nasty soap.  I've seen ""camper's"" soap, which is supposed to be bio-degradable, but a little bottle of it is about 9 bucks...like I said, I'm laid off.  My question is this;  Is there a reasonably priced soap I can buy at the drugstore which is not harmful/less harmful to the water.  The fishing off my dock is pretty good, I want to keep it that way for my nephews."

347908,Bly,2009-06-03 18:25:00,1556,I think it is great that you are thinking of the environment and the waters   Here is a link that might help you out..... Soap/Camp Info
347926,johnnyb,2009-06-03 18:56:00,3413,"My Bio-degradeable ""Campers Soap"" is made by coghlan's, is available at Wal-Mart...I thought it was only $6.  Maybe it is $9, but I can tell you that I still have half a bottle after a few years...all I use it for is the dishes, and am suprised at how little is required.  IF you're going to bathe with it all summer long...it may not last that long.  But seriously...anything ""environmentally friendly"" is prolly gonna be a lot more than $9... Being ""green"" makes lots of ""green"" these days"
347939,cram,2009-06-03 19:16:00,1733,The best thing to do is bring a bucket with you and rinse off on land (even if you don't get it all -- one bucket of water should take most).  Even just a few feet of soil and plant material can do a TON for filtering that stuff out.
347941,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-03 19:21:00,0,"Camp soap is key.  It lasts long.  To wash you don't need to load it on like you would your bottle of Pantene Pro V.  A single drop at a time will accomplish a lot.  Most importantly, it lathers well in cold water.  Factor in that it can also do dishes etc... Fork over the few dollars for it and use it sparingly.  My bottle is 3 or 4 seasons old and I haven't even used half of it."
348028,wuchikubo,2009-06-03 23:14:00,1114,"I was looking at something like that recently, I've come across something called Soap Nuts, a naturally occurring fruit which shell produces a substance that could be used for soap or shampoo. Sounds interesting, but I would need to test it out first."
348033,Fishnwire,2009-06-03 23:30:00,983,"I guess I'll spring for a bottle...if it lasts as long as some of you have indicated, it's probably worth it.  Sorry Bly, but after 3 or 4 days of sweat, bugs, working in the bush and using an outhouse...a wash cloth is just not gonna do.  Not if you want that ""fresh"" feeling down low.  I promise I'll try keeping it to a minimum.  Thanks for everyone's input."

Castile soap is supposed to be environmentally friendly.  http://www.millersoap.com/castile.html#FavCastile  Of course the ingredients would probably set you back some, but you'd have a whack of soap!  Maybe you can find commercially-produced castile soap at a reasonable price per bar. Might be something to watch out for."
