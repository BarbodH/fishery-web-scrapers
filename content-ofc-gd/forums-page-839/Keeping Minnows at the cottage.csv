Everything was great until I got the minnows...man they stink ! I've had fish in the past, but wow, nothing smelt that bad...anyone have similar experience?"

347510,Rizzo,2009-06-02 22:24:00,4754,"nope, I put them in one of those wire mesh minnow traps and set them on bottom in 8 feet of water the odd time I have used live bait. If you're worried about them getting out then plug up the 2 holes."
347512,solopaddler,2009-06-02 22:30:00,8605, I meant most that a keep a stock of minnows at their cottage for the season.
