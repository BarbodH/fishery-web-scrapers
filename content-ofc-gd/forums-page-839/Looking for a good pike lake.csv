345984,Doop,2009-05-29 02:21:00,22,Trying to plan a trip with my buddy. We are mainly pike fisherman...take a walleye or two for shore lunch. Does anyone have any suggestions for a good pike lake?  Looking for size rather than numbers.  THANKS!
346207,johnnyb,2009-05-29 21:53:00,3413,"Hmmm...depends how far you want to go and if you're looking for rustic or not. Lake Muskoka has decent pike fishing for easy access....but if you go further north, say to Nosbonsing, or the West Arm of Nipissing, you can do quite well, with wilderness camping opportunities. Better yet, head up to Temagami, or hwy. 144 towards Timmins...lots and lots of fishable Pike Territory. don't want to go THAT far north, drive up 69 or 11, and hang a left or right on #520....the pike highway!  fish what looks good  Just what comes to mind when I read your post...."

346368,Doop,2009-05-30 15:39:00,22,Awesome...thanks guys. Yeah we are campers who prefer the roughing it version.  Don't mind driving at all....especially if you have a good shot at a 40 plus.
346423,pike slayer,2009-05-30 22:32:00,1177,where do you live and how far do you want to go?
347581,Doop,2009-06-03 01:04:00,22,Distance really isn't a problem.....our biggest concern is price. We are two school teachers on a budget...looking to make our first trip to Canada for pike.  I do like the look of Little Vermilion.
347770,Rich,2009-06-03 13:41:00,3927,"Chandos Lake is a good choice too. Ontario's full of big pike, head north you shouldn't have trouble finding a decent lake."
347864,JerseyDog,2009-06-03 17:28:00,190,i like georgian bay a lot.
347907,solopaddler,2009-06-03 18:25:00,8605,Well if distance isn't a concern the best drive to pike fishery in eastern Canada imo is LG 4 reservoir in Quebec. Trailer your boat up there and camp.
347912,Basskicker,2009-06-03 18:34:00,421,There you go again lol ...LG 4...tempting me again  .....too bad she's still FROZEN
347915,solopaddler,2009-06-03 18:36:00,8605, LOL! Check your pm's.
