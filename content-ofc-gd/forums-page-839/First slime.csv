347181,Dara,2009-06-02 02:01:00,3052,"Well, the weather sucked all weekend, but I managed a couple hours of fishing around noon Saturday.   I'm new to the river fishing here. I have done piles of backwoods fishing and always ignored the StMarys river except for the salmon that is. I decided that this year I had to see what all the buzz was about out there.  The guy where I bought the boat said that the walleye were starting to hit in Echo bay. Just toss out a worm with maybe a one bladed spinner and drift around.  Ok..I'll give it a shot.     Pretty poor weather, but the rain and mist made the hills look pretty. I remember it being shallow in there, but only 3'. Suprised me.    I only fished for an hour and a half. It just got too wet. Had a good time though.  Oh yeah...the fish. One walleye and one nice perch.    I never measured it but it was an easy 20""  The new rod is a 6' 6 medium fast G loomis with a Diawa reel...I don't remember the model but its a pretty blue.. Good way to break it in.  Went again tonight with my son and he lost one about the same size boatside.  I want the river fishing because you can go for a couple hours in the evening after work. Once I learn the places and tricks...look out walleye"

347195,pike slayer,2009-06-02 02:27:00,1177,nice wally. were you in that shallow bay left of the highway going towards echo bay? i've heard ppl getting some good sized pike at the bridge there
347197,Leecher,2009-06-02 02:30:00,7832,"Great way to brake a new rod  on a 20""er Good job and thanks for sharing Leechman"
347202,Dara,2009-06-02 02:47:00,3052,"  thats the one...and the reel is  a Tierra in a matching blue. really smooth outfit   thats the place dangler. We fished it as kids years ago, but I'm just finding out that it holds eyes in the spring   I was happy with that. I had a new rod and reel a few years back that on the Very First cast got me a 5 lb eye. And you only get one first cast. It was pretty neat"
347333,bigbuck,2009-06-02 13:31:00,2449,"I think all of us should toss our expensive gear and buy the Dora The Explorer kiddie fishing rods. My daughter slimed the boat with a 3lb pike on GBay, nice little christening for it. As for my wife and I with $500 of gear, we got skunked, my little one caught a little perch with her Sponge Bob kiddie rod. I tell ya, if it keeps up like this, it's going to be a long dry summer for me............."
347335,troutologist,2009-06-02 13:32:00,951,Nice eye there. Won't be too long now and those fish will drop out of the bay. Some fish to be caught on the otherside of the hwy in a few weeks.
