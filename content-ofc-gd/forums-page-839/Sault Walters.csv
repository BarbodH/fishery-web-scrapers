347223,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-02 03:19:00,0,raced out of sault ste. marie at 5 pm tonight to fish a few hours before dark.  arrived at a very buggy landing and dashed everything down to the lake.  fished a dropoff near a creek mouth.  most fish were in 13-15 fow.  bonked several eaters for the table and one real nice photo fish!

347329,troutologist,2009-06-02 13:28:00,951,Beauty fish Luc. Didnt run into any other species there yet?  I might do a combo rapids/night walleye fish this week if youre interested.
347339,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-02 13:39:00,0, surprisingly i didn't see any hammerhandles or OOS bass. fish came from the mouth of Carp Drop Creek.
347343,Dara,2009-06-02 13:42:00,3052,  Are they in there yet?  I better get my Nexus card soon eh
347347,troutologist,2009-06-02 13:49:00,951,  Ahh old carp drop...we beat the bass up there a few times eh. Be nice to get out with the big lures there in a week or so.

347929,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-03 19:01:00,0,"returned last night avec troutologist for round II. this trip was much less productive.  hits were real light.  a few missed fish was all we could muster... turning into the dock at the end of the night troutologist did hook an OOS smallie, but that was about it.  booourns."
347963,troutologist,2009-06-03 20:10:00,951,Ya conditions seemed good but it was a ghost town....we'll have to giver again one of these nights.
347998,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-03 22:01:00,0,for now i'll blame the malfunctioning fish finder.
348092,Dara,2009-06-04 01:47:00,3052,"My fish finder broke too, but I still picked up 3 nice ones...but yeah..light bite"
