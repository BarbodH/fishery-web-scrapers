He took on the co-owner of Hayabusa Fightwear, and olympic alternate (judo) Luke Harris. Luke is a tough fighter from Edmonton, and a purple belt in BJJ under Fabio Holanda, his credentials are undeniable. We got the call 3 weeks ago for this fight, and with Mike being just 19 years old, its a win/win for him. The fight gets bloody!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef09Y8l9dVc"

I hope he goes far in the sport, we need more canadians representing MMA!  good luck to him in future fights.  AA."
