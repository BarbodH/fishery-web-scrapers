347849,CLofchik,2009-06-03 16:53:00,854," Pssst Shad colour.  They dive a little bit deeper than a Big O, but the hooks are killer stock.  Memorable moments, 4 species in four passes through the same hole trolling the Grand (whistletrout, channel, smallie then a trout.  In June).  My Big O loving friend finally cried ""No Mas, No Mas!"" one windy day on a back lake when I went three 18"" bass in three casts.  Hell I've even caught chinook on them casting infront of Bronte.  They've got a weird funky wobble.........yes I am a big fan  Now on Husky Jerks.....other than a few jointed baits I'm officially off Rapala's.  Heresy I know, but I just never did that great on them.  Their ""wobble"" always seemed to me to be a tad tight.  I always liked Redfins better, and for a suspending Secret Weapon before suspending lures became all the rage we doctored ours by injecting water into them.  Casts like a bullet, has alot looser wobble than a HJ or XRap, used to be the Secret Weapon casting for browns off pier heads in the spring and pike.  Bombers work too, but Redfins are my ""comfort bait""    3.5cc's for a 6"" Redfin 2.5-3cc for a Bomber Long A"
347913,solopaddler,2009-06-03 18:34:00,8605,  Agree on the action of the floating Rap stick baits. That's why each and every one I use is doctored so that it runs a bit more erratically  . You do this by bending the eye down slightly..  I learned that trick 26 years ago on the Bad River...  Only picking 5 was tough. I also really like the Ripplin' Redfin and Storm Thunderstick Jr...

Quarter-ounce jig with smoke-coloured, three-inch Yamamoto grub 3. Original Lunker City Slug-Go, black 4. Heddon Tiny Torpedo, any colour (fish only see the silhouette anyway) 5. Either No. 7 Shad Rap in black and silver, or a half-ounce white spinnerbait with tandem Colorado blades  The Mepps is a no-brainer, I can use it to cover water and search out active fish at any depth. The jig is the go-to if the fish aren't active. The Slug-Go gives me something to use in even the thickest weeds, at any depth or speed. The Torpedo is unbeatable any time there's a topwater bite. If I'm fishing a shield lake, I'll take the Shad Rap. If it's a meso or eutrophic lake, then definitely the spinnerbait."
