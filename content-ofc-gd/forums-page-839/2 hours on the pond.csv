Anyway at around 7pm both wife and baby were napping and i thought i'd hook up the boat and try a little pond up the road.  Went there opening weekend with a buddy and drew a blank apart from a few small pike. Surprisingly enough for such a small lake this lake has a good walleye population, and even a few bass.   GOT INTO A WALLEYE ABOUT AFTER AROUND 20 MINS       TROLLED AROUND FOR ANOTHER 1/2 HOUR WITH NO BITES, ONLY A LONE LOON FOR COMPANY       HOOKED INTO PSYCHO BABY PIKE, THOUGHT HE'D GET AWAY BY BITING THROUGH MY ANCHOR LINE....LOL          GOT A FEW MORE PIKE ON TOPWATER, ALL PRETTY SMALL THOUGH       TROLLING BACK TO THE TRUCK I GOT INTO A BETTER WALLEYE        All in all a great couple of hours mesing around on this small pond. All the walleye went back as this is such a small lake, the pike were also returned."

Seriously, its teeth just got caught up in the rope fibres, people fish for gar with short lengths of stranded rope or something similar. Their teeth get caught up in them, without even getting hooked."
