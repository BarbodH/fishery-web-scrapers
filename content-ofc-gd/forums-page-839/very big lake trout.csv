347706,craigdritchie,2009-06-03 11:41:00,1586,"You're right Swordfish, and overall, that's true. Levels of some types of contaminants in Lake Ontario have dropped significantly since the 70s. Phosphorous would be a great example.  But unfortunately, levels of many other types of chemicals have not declined one bit. And the simple fact is, brand-new chemical contaminants show up all the time.  Beyond that, our testing capabilities have become more sophisticated. We are now able to test for things we couldn't test for before. Some chemicals have always been there, we just couldn't measure them until now.  None of this makes me want to think about slicing that guy's big laker into fillets and grabbing a box of Fish Crisp."

There are piles of greasers in Lake O, Ontario stocks more lakers than rainbows. There have been half a dozen confirmed 30's around the lake this year.  Unclench everybody, jeez."

347878,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-03 17:45:00,0, gimme a break.
347881,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-03 17:48:00,10439,"OK, so here's my opinion for what it's worth. If that fish had come from any other lake than Huron, Michigan or Ontario I would have wanted it to go back in the lake. I used to fish lakers in Lake O a lot and over the years have caught plenty in the 25-35 pound range. They grow very quickly down there when compared to Northern fish. They also don't live anywhere near as long. That same size fish up here would be about 60 years old, while I bet that fish is less than ten years old and near the end of it's life. That fish does seem to be a genetic anomaly though as it is quite short. Maybe it is a triploid, any one know if they are planting triploid fish in Ontario? In BC they are stocking a lot of diploid and triploid rainbows in the lakes there."
347882,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-03 17:48:00,0," funny because the mnr refers to it as a rehabilitation project.  that's leaps and bounds different than a put and take.  just because it has yet to be successful doesn't mean it's designation has changed.  if you can find published information to the contrary, i'm all eyes."

347368,bassassin,2009-06-02 14:47:00,152,Fish lake Ontario and youll see that the lake Trout population is thriving! I didnt know P3TA had an anglers club!!! let the guy enjoy his catch..... I know hes released a hell of alot more than hes kept thus he has done alot more for the fishery than most of you haters!!!! CONGRATS ON THE GREAT CATCH BUD!!!
347380,ecmilley,2009-06-02 15:19:00,2163,congrats nice fatty there

Everyone on this board has there own ideals and moral, etc. on catch and release, and keepin....thats what makes this board great....and leave P3ta out of it...i really dislike that word."

347411,Steve,2009-06-02 16:55:00,2075," I see you haven't fished Lake O recently. Geez, lots of comments from someone who has no idea what he's talking about!  Ask anyone who fishes Lake Ontario about the Lake Trout stocks...it sounds like you might be surprised."
347414,craigdritchie,2009-06-02 17:03:00,1586,"I have no problem with the guy keeping that fish. There's absolutely no shortage of lake trout in Lake Ontario, and virtually all of them came out of a hatchery to begin with.  MNR began stocking lake trout into Lake Ontario in 1971, dumping anywhere from 400,000 to over 1 million fish into the lake each year. Over the same period, New York has also stocked similar numbers of lake trout. Given that lakers can live to 25 or 30 years of age, the Lake O population could be as high as 15 - 20 million fish.  Both Ontario and New York have documented lake trout spawning sites where the eggs hatch and little fry emerge, but survival of these little guys is apparently very poor. Possible causes are said to include thiamine deficiency in eggs and fry, and predation of eggs by round gobies. But in the last 10 years both Ontario and NY have also found lower survival rates for stocked lake trout as well. The latest thinking is that the problem could really be high (and growing) chemical contaminant levels. Biologists have found high concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (also known as PBDEs) in Lake O lake trout in recent years. Whatever the cause, the outlook isn't good. From the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission's 2008 annual report: ""The short-term outlook for restoring a self-sustaining population of lake trout in Lake Ontario at this time is poor.""  That being the case, some guy bonking a big laker for the derby will have zero impact on the fishery, so where's the harm? Shoot, it could even help matters by drawing attention to the fact there really are some pretty big fish out there, and maybe its picture on the 'net and in a newspaper might encourage more people to go fishing. That will help the fishery more than anything else."
347422,Roy,2009-06-02 18:19:00,13728,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion. As far as I'm concerned, it's none of my business, the fish is a legal catch, and thank you for showing it to us.  Craig_Ritchie, that's a good take on the situation.  It's human nature to attack or be afraid of others who succeed.  Thanks again for posting it."
347425,tonyb,2009-06-02 18:26:00,1637,"Great informative post Craig.  It serves as an excellent example to others to understand or learn about the matter before turning into a self proclaimed expert and spreading misinformation.  I like to think of our Lake Ontario Lake Trout as the Rodney Dangerfield trout  They really do get 'no respect'!  I'm hoping to catch one tonight, see you on the water. Tony"
347439,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-02 19:00:00,0,"so by many OFC'ers standard's a hatchery dependent fishery is considered ""thriving""?  i'm glad you folks are down on lake ontario!"

347478,JoshS,2009-06-02 21:17:00,729,"That's a freakin beaut!!  Nothing really wrong with keeping a fish like that outta lake O considering the unsuccessful reproduction issue and population of lake trout, plus it was a derby!  I doubt anyone would let that thing go with first prize on the line.  If it was a smaller lake I would be opposed to keeping it.  Like Craig said, its good publicity and could get more people involved in the sport which will be better for the business and fisheries in the long run.  Nice fish!"
347557,siwash,2009-06-03 00:08:00,683,"  I suppose you're not familiar with Lake O!! Yes, the fish down here are fat! They grow big ad fast and fat from all the baitfish in the lake...  keep in mind that your sonar can go black from clouds of bait that are 80-100' in size from top to bottom! My rigger cables would vibrate as these clouds appeared as the alwives would bounce off the cable!  The lake is so rich with fish - I'll bet that laker is 1/3 maybe 1/4 the age of a similar sized laker from up north  BTW, apparently a 32lb+ fish was caught the week before!"
347561,siwash,2009-06-03 00:10:00,683,  you really should do you research... lake o lakers fishery is a put-n-take... but some natural reproduction is occuring..

347670,bigfish1965,2009-06-03 04:59:00,3382,Get over it Dr Its a put and take fishery with salmon and lakers and has been for two generations now. Until we find a way to repair the damage done to spawning areas it won't change. The salmon are fewer..but that is the biggest Laker I have seen out of Lake O. Monster fish...tail reminds me of a triploid almost.
347678,Sinker,2009-06-03 07:34:00,8692,    Its one laker folks.......don't lose sleep over it!! I woulda bonked it too!!
347690,rhare,2009-06-03 10:33:00,387,"   Well if you dont claim to be an expert then why make a comment about Superior being the only stable Lake trout population in Ontario?   There is no shortage of lakers in Lake O. Its nothing to go out target them and pick up 10-15 fish in a half day and its common to get fish above 15lbs.In Nov the Niagara river has 1000's and 1000's of lakers running the river to spawn, they become a pain when fishing for steelies! They are never abused because no one wants to eat big lakers anyways. The Americans stock tons of them and they thrive on the bar with the abundance of bait.  The man in the pic releases more fish a year the most guys catch in two!!!"

347133,fishdawg,2009-06-02 00:50:00,912,by all accounts its been a great year on Lake O for lakers.... the St Cath derby ususally gives a good representation of the Laker fishery As does the vrious LOC derbies held on the NY side of the lake. The last few yrs most of the 1st place lakers are generally 20-24lbs. I cant remember the last time there was one over 25.  Catch of a liftetime for 'ol Roho indeed. Congrats once again bud. I would have kept it as well.
