862564,misfish,2014-07-10 19:04:00,29133,That Cave was closed yesterday. That's they real interest I have.
862627,Cast-Away,2014-07-11 02:26:00,790,My wife and I went today for the opener and were probably 2000 people back but got in within 20 minutes. The place was fully stocked and there were some decent deals and some real quality products. The store is more geared to the hunting community than the fishing and boating community.  I visited the Michigan location and was far more impressed than I was with this location as far as the static displays and size of the building goes. It is worth a visit and closer for many OFC members than going all the way to Bass Pro.
862637,hutch4113,2014-07-11 11:28:00,374,"Went in yesterday.  It was busy, but nothing to extreme.  I am disappointed in the fishing section however.  Not as big as I expected - and nothing really unique.  I was hoping they would carry big plastics, but seemed to be limited to 4 inch sizes.  I will use them, it looks like i will mostly shop online, and ship it to the store.  I was speaking with one of the staff before I left however - he did advise they still had not received all there stuff - another truck was supposed to be coming with other items - will see...."
862638,misfish,2014-07-11 11:36:00,29133,Did they bring out the yum tubes they were to have on sale? I found 1 pkg Wednesday.
862647,Oryx,2014-07-11 13:51:00,186,Made it for the opening...it was a zoo.  The only thing worse than the crowd to going was Mapleview.  Getting in and out was a nightmare  Ended up getting the Advanced Angler bag I've been eying for a year now
862684,misfish,2014-07-11 19:12:00,29133,"Did they bring out the yum tubes they were to have on sale? I found 1 pkg Wednesday.    YUPPPPPPPPY  They did. $2.45 a pkg is a steal  Still a packed mad house though. it,s nice that I can be in out and be gone in minutes.  There were a couple of anglers there signing . Their names were Leo and Ron."
862707,Ralph Field,2014-07-11 23:24:00,1018,You must be mean Buddy & Buddy.
862721,OhioFisherman,2014-07-12 08:36:00,6623,"They just opened a brand new Cabelas down here by where I work (Delaware, US).  Its fairly small by Cabelas standards, but it seems to be fairly well stocked.  I also find that their prices seem a bit high.  They do however have a big clearance wall filled with fantastic deals on lures.  Their musky selection was terrible though.  I also find that their fishing section is so stinking big, that its hard to find what I'm looking for. The Muskie selection may be due to the area market? There is really not much of a point in stocking items in local area stores where the market is small?  I have been to WalMart stores near lakes known for their muskie fishing and found muskie tackle ( limited) , the one by me might carry Power Pro braid, just not a big demand for it in my area. Walmart like the Big Box outdoors stores can offer a larger selection on line than they can possibly carry in a small local area store.  They didn't build that Cabela's too close to the BPS store? Market realities? We would probably all like to have the biggest bestist tackle store right next door? They probably understand better that the market might not support it?  Pricing? I always found the price of just about everything in Ontario to be a lot higher than here. Either transportation costs or purchasing power? Meaning no disrespect, but it is what it is."
862740,Whopper,2014-07-12 16:23:00,2174,"Some one who gets it. Like OhioFisherman things cost more in Ontario  A few years back here locally we had a Gander Mountian and the manager was a fisherman, great selection and decent prices. He even gave me a geat deal on my first musky rod/reel combo that he put together out of stock. A Dicks moved in right across the street which I thought would be a good thing for competitive pricing which didn't happen. The original store manager at Gander Mountain left and the new person that has taken over moved the fishing section and cut in about half, besides some odds and ends I don't buy much from them and the store is less than 5 minutes from my house."
862743,okumasheffield,2014-07-12 16:55:00,318,Just came back from Cabela Barrie.  found the pricing is very CANADIAN
862744,Tim Mills,2014-07-12 17:05:00,476,"Its not unlike when Target came.  People unrealistically expect the same prices/experience as when they shop in the US.  I visited the Cabelas Dundee store last fall.  I thought the prices were high there too.  Nice selection, big hunting section, good restaurant but not many deals in the main store.  Most of the stuff I bought was clearance priced in the Bargain Cave."
862770,HTHM,2014-07-12 19:13:00,4082,Cheektowaga opens early Aug
862820,porkpie,2014-07-13 10:00:00,2521,"I went, and while it is not a US Cabelas, they did have lots of the Cabelas brand products, and items that you could previously only get by ordering.  My opinion is its a winner!  Not quite the same as the full experience, but a pretty good sampling of the good stuff!  I'm glad to have them, even though its a long drive.  Picked up a couple of good bargain cave items, and a couple of regular priced ones as well.   I will definately stop in again when I'm fishing in the area!"
862845,Fisherman,2014-07-13 13:59:00,7201,"For us ""northerners"" it at least saves the wretched trip down the 400 to the city zoo."
862848,kickingfrog,2014-07-13 14:07:00,8333,Picked up this cicada at the friends and family pre-opening because I knew the mayfly hatch was on Nipissing.  
862882,misfish,2014-07-13 17:10:00,29133,Did your brother like his gift Rob?
862889,kickingfrog,2014-07-13 17:39:00,8333,Sure did. No muskies though.
862935,Rustic-Fisher,2014-07-13 22:05:00,826,"Stopped by today to check the place out, it was a zoo but that was to be expected on a Sunday. Though it was busy it was always easy to find an associate for price checks etc .  Was able to spend a few moments in the gun room ( solo with two kids under five ) and it was refreshing to see the staff actually had some shotgun knowledge and gun dog know how. Kids were spoiled rotten with free swag and loved the kids sections. The thing that impressed me most was when we picked a new dog bed with no price on it, inquired about it with staff and were given a price of 39.99. Got to the front to check out and the bed came up as 79.99. Cashier called the manager over,  a quick on line search revealed the bed was in fact 79.99. The manager honoured the price quoted to me without me even asking. Impressive . I look forward to hitting the place once the crowds fizzle out, and hope the service stays the same."
863205,SBCregal,2014-07-15 15:25:00,688,"We stopped by yesterday around 8:00 on our way through Barrie coming from up north.  It looked like they had a pretty good supply of hunting gear and firearms.  As mentioned, the pricing is what you'd expect at a big box retail store.  I didn't venture through the fishing stuff but it did seem like a smaller area when compared to the hunting stuff.  It looked like they sold handguns as well, which is something I believe Bass Pro doesn't (a Toronto by-law I believe).  It seemed to be laid out a little better than the BPS store in Vaughan as well.  I really do like the idea of being able to ship to store, it's a bit of a drive for me but we go up the 400 often enough that I could pick something up on the way through if planned enough in advance.  When we got there the parking lot was pretty quiet but I could see it being difficult to navigate with a boat or camper hooked to the back of the truck and lots of traffic in the lot.  Overall, I'll go back, even if it is just to browse around and kill some time."
863238,davey buoy,2014-07-15 19:42:00,5505,"I need to browse soon,no hurry,as bps is on my way home and I seem to really like it. Will give Cabelas a shot though."
863245,mcdougy,2014-07-15 20:18:00,274,"It was not what I was expecting, went later last Sunday.  I bought some fudge, it was good. Pralines was my favourite.   Tried to find a silver minnow as I had lost one catching catfish on our holiday further north. I couldn't find one. I was disappointed."
863269,misfish,2014-07-15 21:26:00,29133,"Seems many are not happy with the fishing dept. I did talk to one person asking them if they knew what fish were targeted in the area. His reply was not really. OOPS  I had mentioned that there are many who rig for salmon and trout on GB and lakers on Simcoe. This area ,your store is very under stocked.  You do have lots of baits for walleye and bass and Musky,but as for pan fish,I see you have missed the mark as well.  Like Kicking Frog  said during our visit,,they will figure it out.   The local tackle store carries what the locals want here,and his pricing is at par or better.. BONUS  I find the fishing dept is a carry over of what the state side would use.  This is JMO.   As far as the hunting section goes. They nailed it."
863432,lookinforwalleye,2014-07-16 20:58:00,4399,I think that sums it up pretty well Brian!
863637,Burtess,2014-07-18 02:26:00,901,"Dropped by today on the way home from Midland.  Overall not impressed, just kind of wandered around, not too keen on the layout.  Prices....ouch lol...  The worst part is the actual store location.  The far back of the complex?  And when you leave to get on the 400 Southbound..... 3 or 4 cars make the left per green signal?  Brutal.  Can't see myself wasting the time to visit again unless I want to pick up an advertised sale item or something....  Burt"
862295,BillM,2014-07-09 03:18:00,17367,I don't think there were any grand opening specials... Expect similar prices to what you see down at the BPS in Vaughan.  People expecting US prices don't quite understand how things work.
862303,solopaddler,2014-07-09 09:11:00,8605,I'll admit I'm not much of a shopper. Generally I know exactly what I want and won't quibble over a few dollars if someone has what I need. If the Cabelas in Barrie is stocked in a similar fashion to its U.S counterparts I'll be thrilled.
862306,misfish,2014-07-09 09:50:00,29133,"After reading this thread, I have lost that excitement  of getting off at noon today and heading over. Think I,ll save that half day for another time and work the full 8 hrs today. So I,ll be walking in their doors at 2pm"
862308,Garnet,2014-07-09 10:24:00,2056,I looked a flyer. NOTHING.  Will be camping in couple weeks at Bass Lake maybe we will get a rain day!
862340,Terry,2014-07-09 15:15:00,14456,I should be there around one As l long as there is park.
862341,Fisherman,2014-07-09 16:06:00,7201,I should be there around one As l long as there is park. Careful of the potholes and craters.
862381,misfish,2014-07-09 20:31:00,29133,    Thats all I got to say about this thread.
862383,davey buoy,2014-07-09 20:35:00,5505,"I hear you Brian,I'l be lucky if I drop in over the next couple of weeks. Nothing just came out and grabed you so to speak. Thanks for the early reports guys.Saves me rushing in Friday."
862393,Terry,2014-07-09 20:57:00,14456,well  what was disappointing  could not find what I  wanted  way too many  people with carts  line up to cash out where long I dropped the couple of things I had and left  will try again in a week or 2
862395,grimsbylander,2014-07-09 21:09:00,3016,"The store is 70,000sq.ft. and the stores stateside are 200,000sq.ft. plus. Canadian pricing is always nuts. = No surprises."
862397,fishnsled,2014-07-09 21:13:00,3520,"Sounds like I can avoid that road trip anytime soon, not that I was planning one.  Just a bad location for me, as is BPS.  With the price of gas being what it is, I'll keep shopping locally."
862410,misfish,2014-07-09 22:12:00,29133,"The best part of the drop in,was a meet up with OFC friend Rob (kicking frog) Joined me and educated me more on harnesses.  Hope your weekend goes well."
862411,kickingfrog,2014-07-09 22:14:00,8333,I like it. It's five minutes from work and less then 15 minutes from my house. BPS and Sail will have to have screaming deals for me to drive 1.5-2 hours round trip (No traffic) now.

862481,ckrb2007,2014-07-10 03:02:00,449,I'll be heading there tomorrow.....just 'cuz it's literally 3mins away from my house. Wasn't too overly excited about the flyer so it'll be more like a walk around the store. I went to the West Virginia store opening years ago and that place was wild!!!
862487,BillM,2014-07-10 04:07:00,17367,I think I'll hit the store maybe an hour before closing tomorrow.  I could use some big Kalins 5in grubs.

862537,kickingfrog,2014-07-10 15:41:00,8333,Looks like the whole town showed up. Glad I had a chance to go yesterday. Lake Nipissing tonight.
862550,ckrb2007,2014-07-10 16:46:00,449,"Just got back from there. Complete zoo. I was one of the first 100 in the line....another 2000 were behind me I think. lol Couldn't really check out the store. Got a few deals from the bargain cave and some freebies (hat, shirt, beer cozies, beef jerky)."
862052,Fisherman,2014-07-08 00:33:00,7201,"Well I expected a zoo full of people but that's not part of the overall first impression.  Looked like a lot of people were browsing and price checking.  I hope the store does price matching 'cause right off the bat there were several items I found cheaper even with the employee discount.  One particular fellow in the fishing department might want to learn the art of customer service and attention rather than babble about his personal musky fishing expeditions.  He wouldn't give me the 10 seconds for a price check on a new Lowrance 5HDI.  The one item I did take, a Kolpin ATV box model 93400 will be going back.  Once out of the cardboard box, it's got to be the floppiest ATV storage box made.  The cardboard box it came in was more rigid.  Anyway, they do have all the basic fishing and hunting stuff, just watch the prices."
862054,Terry,2014-07-08 00:44:00,14456,I   will be checking on wed.
862057,Fisherman,2014-07-08 00:53:00,7201,"Just checked a couple of places for that 5HDI with Gold Navionics card, over $100 cheaper elsewhere, even to get it shipped from south of the border."
862063,Duckie,2014-07-08 01:03:00,305,"Hopefully their storefront is as good as their online stuff.  I have ordered from them online in the past many times and found their shipping to be prompt and their customer service to be excellent, esp when I have had to return stuff or file a warrantly claim (eg. on a broken cabelas travel rod ).  nothing but good things about the online experience with them  hopefully the actual store can measure up"
862070,Fisherman,2014-07-08 01:34:00,7201,I'll have to call tomorrow to see if they do price matching.  I'll agree that over 30 years of on line shopping has been nothing but stellar compared to others.
862076,Steve,2014-07-08 01:45:00,2075,"i would like to hope that if you find an item cheaper at your local shop, you purchase the item from your local shop, and not go to cabela's for a price match."
862086,porkpie,2014-07-08 02:23:00,2521,"Cabelas US is awesome.  I don't know if they will be able to match their US experience here.  If you've never been to an American cabelas, it is worth the visit.  I am hoping the Barrie Cabelas was worth the wait.  I'll find hit next weekend!"
862087,lookinforwalleye,2014-07-08 02:30:00,4399,I was there this evening as well and I guess it was okay IMHO the selection of fishing tackle does not compare to BPS but to be honest I doubt if I will be going back!

862110,Steve,2014-07-08 11:03:00,2075,"not a given anymore,  folks will drive 20 minutes to save four dollars...then go back to their local shops and complain about their pricing....THAN have the nerve to ask where the fish are biting....  many folks don't give the first crap about local shops....just saving a dollar.  nothing surprises me anymore...and I've seen this all FIRST HAND at my local shop.  Personally, I won't spend a single dime in BPS or Cabela's, unless the item couldn't be purchased anywhere else (such as the bps raingear).  Sail - yes. They are 100% Canadian."
862112,lookinforwalleye,2014-07-08 11:37:00,4399,"This thread was about first impressions not about small tackle shops but since that oft opened can of worms has been re-opened yet again....if I can save a few bucks so be it, I have been unemployed for 16 months and it seems every government agency and store is digging deeper into my ever empting pockets.

862245,Canuck2fan,2014-07-08 23:03:00,1444,"I have ordered from the US site and found most of the time since they build out west that, ordering from the US was still the cheaper option overall in many cases. I don't expect that to change just because they have a store in Barrie. The Canadian arm of Cabelas just seems to feel that we will pay more up here if you get it shipped IMO.  Of course now the exchange is higher so pricing up here will have to increase to compensate for that....  I am hoping to eventually get to the store though to check out the fit of their guide wear so I know what to order when the U.S. has their next half sale, since I was totally unimpressed by the pricing on it for their GRAND opening special.."
