863709,landry,2014-07-18 16:16:00,1005,My friend gave me some free lexan so I made up a bump board. Can't wait to slime it up:) total cost was $15. The lexan was so thin I had to rivet the hinges on. No matter how I attached them there was gonna be some metal against the fish so I added plastic straps to cover it up at the joint.

863714,JoshS,2014-07-18 17:07:00,729,Looks good. Nice and wide too to eliminate slim on the carpet. I use the slim rapala one and musky slime always laces the boat carpet after. Hopefully you land a few in the red!
863715,Tim Mills,2014-07-18 17:10:00,476,"nice bit of engineering there, whats the red-zone 50""+  interesting guard on your bench as well"
863718,Musky or Specks,2014-07-18 17:20:00,2710,"Looks good. Nice and wide too to eliminate slim on the carpet. I use the slim rapala one and musky slime always laces the boat carpet after. Hopefully you land a few in the red! Ah but there's nothing like that musky smell in your carpet stinking up the garage to say  "" I am a success"""
863719,lew,2014-07-18 17:33:00,12766,"Looks like it should work well landry, nice job.  Here's another idea and what I use the odd time I want to measure a musky. Just a simple wooden dowel with a cross piece on the end and marked up to 55"".  Once the fish is in the water and I'm holding her tail I just hook the end over her snout and check the number at the end of her tail.  If she's bigger than 55"" I'll have to use my imagination    "
863722,landry,2014-07-18 18:56:00,1005,Very cool Lew.
864015,F_ast,2014-07-20 21:53:00,154,I just made one up myself.  I will post a pic up when I get my stick on ruler
