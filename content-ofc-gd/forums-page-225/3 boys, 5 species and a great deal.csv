I slammed the brakes at the same time the turkey did. We stopped, the turkey did the splits and headed back to the ditch. I instantly wondered why I stopped. Mmmmmm turkey.  We headed to Couch because I had a reel that I wanted to drop off at Rocky's. Fished a few spots and caught some fish. Ryan had a blast and started calling himself the Fish Master. His fish skills are coming along, but his humility needs more work.                      Off the water and headed over to Rocky's to take in an old Abu C4 that started acting up while on Nipissing last week. I figured we'd drop it off and get it in a few weeks with a return trip to the water as well. Younger guy behind the counter takes a quick look as I explain what it was doing wrong and says ""Just hold on, I think I can fix it for you."" He heads back to the parts area and shows up with the part and switches it in for the broken one, gives the handles a spin and it's as good as new. He ask's ""How does 10 bucks sound?"". I felt a little guilty handing him 2 fives. That Abu should be good for another 20 years."

863778,kickingfrog,2014-07-19 00:34:00,8333,Not to put too fine a point on it but I believe he intends it to be pronounced Fish Master.
863779,kickingfrog,2014-07-19 00:40:00,8333,I forgot to mention that there was a second great deal. The Ultramar on West St had gasoline for $1.23. That's about 10 cents cheaper then most of the area.
863809,misfish,2014-07-19 08:29:00,29133,I always buy at Petro Can at the narrows. Yup always cheaper then here.  Thats a great day out there. Think I know that one spot with the rocks sticking out. LOL  As for stopping for turkeys. Good choice. They do a lot of damage for a bird.
