We recently did the proulx lake to dickson/bonfield canoe trip route in the last week of May first week of June. I brought my spin caster, (didn't have a fly rod) and caught nothing but tangles with the triple swivel. My brother and my other buddy (the two who brought their fly rods) hooked into a brooker a minute on the 1.4k portage on the crow. We did this trip in 4 days 3 nights and hardly had time to fish but the time we did have it was amazing. As good as the thought of cooking them up sounded after an exhausting day of portaging and canoeing, we released the fish. It was just the right thing to do.  I am just wondering about your experiences with interior Algonquin fly fishing in the fall and hoping you are willing to share some of your techniques.  We are planning our trip sept 25-31."

No reason why the spinning gear won't produce just as many bites, if not more.  If your buddies are catching fish, keep experimenting until you find something they want to eat"
