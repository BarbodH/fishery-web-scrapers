863570,Rod Caster,2014-07-17 17:32:00,5784,I see them often in the ottawa river and a few lakes arou.d here are known to hold populations of blue pike. Francis lake being one of them.
233149,Grimace,2008-07-26 19:28:00,2020,Its a Silver.    They are a Northern pike without the colour.    The DNA is the same as a Northern.   My dad caught this one Ice fishing in Lake Abitibi.   Congrats you don't get to see them every day.  
233189,purekgw,2008-07-26 23:19:00,585,well i was up north this week and we where fishing so back bays and caught 2 blue bass to bad we did have a camera with us
302612,waterwolf,2009-02-07 01:53:00,556,"fishin' with a friend and his mrs. 10 or 11 yrs. ago on sparrow lake in a canoe.  he tossed a frog to blue pike resting still near the surface . it was about the same size as your pike . asked the outfitter there about it he didn't believe my buddy 'til the pike was shown to him . he didn't know what to make of it. read an article in oood mag.about these fish and mnr asks you report and catches or sightings.  nice picture of a rare fish ,,congrat's."
302662,Moosebunk,2009-02-07 03:09:00,3970,Lots of those fish in the Abitibi and tributary river systems of the Northeast.

302675,StylinCatch,2009-02-07 03:25:00,43,"Definetly a Silver pike, grass pike from what i believe , still have markings , just a different coloured green tint. Not forsure, but pretty sure."
302678,Greencoachdog,2009-02-07 03:45:00,8163,  154 channels and nothings on eh?
302710,grt1,2009-02-07 04:46:00,638,"I caught 2 of those last summer in Gullrock, I thought they might have been small muskies but I counted the holes under the jaw and this seemed to make them a pike."
302738,WeedLine,2009-02-07 07:07:00,322,"Saw an episode of FishTV where Leo and Ron are fishing pike in Esnagi lake and Ron catches a silver pike in the 12-15lb range. I think they said 1 in every 19, 000 pike get this colour mutation. The guide on the show said that they are common in that area."
302753,codered,2009-02-07 12:47:00,123, Im sure it is a silver pike rare find indeed. were was it caught? This was caught in northern ontario

Blue Bass  ....Black Perch....  I've even Heard of a Red Eye Devil Bass that lives ONLY in Temagami.  Color variations.  RFS

863522,Craigson,2014-07-17 12:44:00,117,"So to clear a few things up. ""Blue Pike "" are extinct. Originally found in Lake Erie. However they are actually Walleye. But, in SW Ontario most ppl call Walleye by Pickerel.  ""Silver Pike"" as shown in OP are indeed a genetic mutation of Northern Pike but they reproduce and are recognized seperately for record purposes.  Im gonna guess that these ""blue bass"" are mis-identified blue gills or somthing else but without pics I really dont know.  Anyway, im going after Pike in August in a lake known to have ""Silver Pike"". Anybody have more info on them? Specifically around North Bay?  Thx"
863529,John Bacon,2014-07-17 13:17:00,3277,"silver pike or as known as grass pike  Grass pike, or grass pickerel are a different species.  Silver pike is just a colour variation of northern pike."

232717,kemper,2008-07-25 16:03:00,2232,"blue pike? maybe, but those seem to be pickerel blue chain pickeral?  reject pike?"
232719,Tdel,2008-07-25 16:15:00,393,Google seems to give info that would identify this as a Silver pike.  A pike mutation. I have never heard of a silver pike but I am pretty sure I have seen one when I was in my teens.  Tom
232723,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-25 16:39:00,0,Looks like a pike that has been brushing itself against rocks...Or just like was said. A hybrid of pike. I have seen muskies with the same coloration.
232724,Nemo,2008-07-25 16:40:00,727,"From Wikipedia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_pike   Alternate forms  [3] Another form of northern pike, the silver pike, is not a subspecies but rather a mutation that occurs in scattered populations. Silver pike, sometimes called silver muskellunge, lack the rows of spots and appear silver or silvery-blue in color. (Craig, 1)."
232726,ehg,2008-07-25 16:41:00,2666,I remember 4- 5 yrs. ago i think kgeary(anglerskingdom) did a post on these silver pike. Apparently there is a lake or two south of Nungesser where they are more common. So they are termed 'silver pike' some colour variation from a Northern Pike. ehg
232727,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-25 16:49:00,3761,Your buddy caught himself a one and only.
232737,Musky or Specks,2008-07-25 17:06:00,2710,Thats definately a silver pike. And thats pretty cool. A blue pike is actually a pickeral.
232755,Reef Runner,2008-07-25 18:09:00,980,"Wow, that's a really rare catch.  Amazing, first I've seen or heard of these fish.  Thanks for sharing."
232766,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 18:24:00,8163,Very Cool and RARE!!!  Thanks for posting that!!!
232779,Disspatcher,2008-07-25 18:44:00,73,http://images.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http...l%3Den%26sa%3DN check out all the different pikes!! this one def. a silver!

232820,Rizzo,2008-07-25 20:08:00,4754,So how did it taste?
232823,modny,2008-07-25 20:20:00,502,thats a jackfish
232894,FinS,2008-07-26 00:48:00,463,silver pike or as known as grass pike
232897,fishindevil,2008-07-26 00:57:00,6254,"Yes i was going to say GRASS PIKE !!!! well done great colors ,nice picture of it as well!!!   cheers"
232905,jwl,2008-07-26 01:11:00,1056,"kind of hard to say from the pic, but looks to me to be a grass pike as well...they tend to not grow as big as northerns, but an identifying feature I think I can see in the pic is the small dark/black verticle line under the eye, although all the grasspike I have ever caught so to speak where dark green with alot of white spotted markings, and often thier heads look too big for the body like the fish still has to grow into it's head"
232955,limeyangler,2008-07-26 02:53:00,5204,"   LOLOL....JWL...that's kinda like saying....""oh yeah......i have a shirt exactly like that....except its green , not black, with short sleeves and no collar""   sorry, couldn't resist"
232978,l2p,2008-07-26 03:46:00,346,how bout this one? 
232980,jwl,2008-07-26 03:55:00,1056,"  ya ya  , but you can see in the pic the distinguishing little dark line under the middle of the eye down to the cheek....that's how you tell if it's a grass pike and not a northern like in the pic that l2p posted.  The one in the post has an unusal colour pattern for sure compared to the classic markings of a grass pike"
232986,FinS,2008-07-26 04:28:00,463,  thats a northern
232988,FinS,2008-07-26 04:31:00,463,mind you if u ever catch a silver pike (grass pike) in the 10 lb range i wanna see it
233062,Burning Babies,2008-07-26 14:31:00,150, The line below the eye of a grass pickerel is much more distinctive.    The line below the eye in that picture appears to be an artifact of the lighting.  That fish is also larger than grass pickerel grow.  It's a northern.
233067,MrMike,2008-07-26 14:49:00,153,neat pic
233127,tonka-toy,2008-07-26 18:06:00,139,Whatever it is I caught one just like it fishing for rainbows near a creek mouth a few years ago.Thanks for the post.
