863051,Rich Clemens,2014-07-14 20:21:00,3131,"Hahahahaha, I was reading about how to take care of a broken pinky toe and someone mentioned their couch did a smackdown on their toe.  Made me laugh.  It is a bit better today and I actually managed to walk the dog around the block.  Still taped up and I've adjusted my Columbia sandals to keep it in place!  Thanks for the advice all, but after mom's heart attack and hematoma recently, I will not be going to the ER to sit there for 12 hours for them to tell me there's nothing I can do.   Oh yes - No Musky Fishing for at least 60 days - can't be stubbing your toes in boat trying to fight and land a monster.   We'll wave at ya sitting on the dock as we head out."
863059,bushart,2014-07-14 20:55:00,2628,Are you finding out that the human body depends on the little toe for some of it's balance??  PS...yes Ouch
863075,Beans,2014-07-14 21:55:00,3339,"When I broke the toe next to the pinky my doc (who used to work in ER at St. Mikes) sent me there but phoned ahead to let them know I was coming...When I arrived I got the royal treatment...""Here's the guy that Howie sent""...so help me, I was in and out of ER in record time (20 minutes) I was sent to x-ray right away, three toes taped together, and answered everybody's questions about how ""Howie"" was doing in the walk-in clinic he and others opened at Leslie and Eastern Ave...Unbelievable  BTW...I can't remember Howie's last name but he wrote a column in the Toronto Star for a few years..."
863076,SirCranksalot,2014-07-14 22:02:00,3291,I moved a coffee table about a foot and a half with my big toe in the dark. No broken bones but the ligaments are still sore months later. More pain then any turf toe I had playing sports.  still a lot better than kicking the bucket!!
863144,JCRG,2014-07-15 01:18:00,57,"Go to your family doctor, he or she will send you for X-rays and if broken will get referred to an ortho specialist...will likely put you in a boot for 6 weeks. It may just be a sprain. Physio after if limited in mobility or pain persists. Either way go to you family doctor"
863168,Woodsman,2014-07-15 05:26:00,1286,Generally nothing will be done for a broken toe. No cast for them. My mother went through the same thing but the big toe. When I was much younger she say's I was a bugger. Did something to piss her off & she went to kick me in the arse. Me not being stupid moved out of the way. She connected with the door frame. Broken toe was the result.
863216,Joey,2014-07-15 17:01:00,9122,  Oh yes - No Musky Fishing for at least 60 days - can't be stubbing your toes in boat trying to fight and land a monster.   We'll wave at ya sitting on the dock as we head out.  Nice try Rich  See you soon
863222,Whopper,2014-07-15 17:24:00,2174,"Milk it Joey, make Paul do all the housework for the next thirty days"
863223,TJQ,2014-07-15 17:48:00,7806,Make hubby kiss it better..  Yup....  lol
863309,danc,2014-07-16 00:34:00,4677,The only bone I've ever broken was my pelvis Joey. So no advice here. Good luck!!
863635,Canuck,2014-07-18 01:51:00,491,"I've done it many many times. I have long toes and they seem to find things to whack into.  I find its more painful to try to do anything with tape.  Just leave it alone and avoid tight shoes.  It will get better on its own after a week or so.  The worst one was when I had a few wobbly pops staying on the boat at Big Sound marina.  Their dock cleats are painted BLACK!.  Bad idea.  I was wobbling full speed back to the boat to drain off a pop and get a new one and I nailed a cleat barefoot.  Peeled the nail off, cut the skin back and broke the toe.  Now that was painful even through the haze."
863644,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-18 03:22:00,10439,Imagine how much more it would have hurt if you were sober!!!
863665,Craigson,2014-07-18 11:22:00,117,"Did u get it x-rayed? Jw if part of ur foot was broken too or just bad bruising.  And it very well could b broken n still walking on it. I broke my Tibia n walked on it for 24 hrs before going to emerg. Just depends on ur pain tolerance.  Anyways, interested to hear how much damage ther is?"
863668,Bernie,2014-07-18 12:00:00,3190,How is your toe today Joey?Hope it is doing better.
863672,Roy,2014-07-18 12:05:00,13728,How is your toe today Joey? Hope it is doing better.  We danced all night....she seems fine.
863674,Bernie,2014-07-18 12:12:00,3190, We danced all night....she seems fine.  Tango or Cha-Cha?

863750,Canuck,2014-07-18 21:04:00,491,You mean like like the next morning with a hangover and a nasty toe???  It did hurt pretty bad.  Now I wear Keens sandals with toes arount the dock (at least when I remember to put them on)
862949,Joey,2014-07-14 00:25:00,9122,"Broke my pinky toe last night.  I had recently redone the spare room to make it a ""walk in closet.""  I put rug in and the weight scale would not work on the rug so I put a glass cutting board underneath it.   So last night, went to put my pajamas on and walked into the cutting board, with my pinky toe going underneath it and the rest of my foot not.   I am in excrutiating pain right now and and wonder if anyone else has broken a toe and what I should do?  IMG_1443 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr   IMG_1445 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr"
862952,lew,2014-07-14 00:35:00,12766,"Lousy luck Joey, hope it's not as sore as it looks."
862953,aplumma,2014-07-14 00:38:00,6896,Tape it to the toe next to it and go see a doctor for an xray.   Art
862954,John,2014-07-14 00:38:00,2956,Looks painful hun.. Not a lot you can do other than ice on and off and keep the swelling down. Done it twice myself so I know what it feels like.
862957,kickingfrog,2014-07-14 00:45:00,8333,Stop kicking things.  See the Doc.  Firmer soled shoes that aren't tight might help a bit if/when you have to walk on it.
862958,Fisherman,2014-07-14 00:46:00,7201,Make hubby kiss it better..
862960,Joey,2014-07-14 00:48:00,9122,"Okay, thanks.  I did ice it last night, so I just taped it to the other toe.  Feels a bit better.  Hopefully it wont hurt for too long."
862964,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-14 00:53:00,10439,"Been there, done that. As said, tape it to the next toe over and drink lots of rum!!!"
862965,esoxansteel,2014-07-14 00:59:00,1307,"Hope its not like your tongue when you bite it, you usually bite it again and again, i dont think you want to keep banging that pinky toe over and over, even with the pretty toe nail polish it still looks pretty damn sore, id be putting on a pair of steel toed boots, and keep them on until that thing heals, between copious amounts of Black Zamubuka, or Dark Rum of course"
862966,Joey,2014-07-14 01:09:00,9122,"Hahahaha, good advice liverelease"
862967,Gerritt,2014-07-14 01:09:00,6129," Sorry to hear hun, as suggested tape it to the other toe, not too tight though. Ice 15 on 15 off. Ibuprofen to reduce swelling, wear loose fitting flexible footwear (flip flops) so you are able to not put pressure on the toe. After all that, watch where you are walking for the next couple weeks... As the slightest bump will make your toe sing!  Rest will help this more then anything.   G"
862969,Handlebarz,2014-07-14 01:15:00,3790,Dang that looks sore. A friend just broke his toe so the doctor cut it off no joke
862971,glen,2014-07-14 01:20:00,2641,"""excrutiating pain"" would not mean just a broken toe to me. I would get it checked ASAP."
862972,Weeds,2014-07-14 01:24:00,782,"Seeing a doctor is probably a good idea, especially if your now thinking of cutting it off. You probably would want a professional for something like that, regardless of how dark rum or Sambucca you have kicking around."
862973,Tom McCutcheon,2014-07-14 01:30:00,627,"Not a lot to be done for a broken toe other than what has already been suggested. Ice and elevation to keep the swelling down, painkiller for when it's needed.  I would also paint your toes the same pretty purple black colour....."
862974,woodenboater,2014-07-14 01:43:00,2277,"I'd go to ER asap if it were me. but yeah, elevate and ice it. while it may be a break, you may also have done some ligament damage.  just to reiterate cuz I think it warrants it, go to ER tonight.  and on a lighter note, great sandal tan )))"
862990,spoon,2014-07-14 04:25:00,74,"Joey, it is hard to diagnose your foot just from your picture, but it does not look good. Lateral part of your foot is showing excessive ecchymosis (bruising), which is a sign of bleeding under your skin. It could just be your blood vessels that are damaged which heal quickly. Bones also have their own blood network and this takes longer to heal and it needs medical intervention to correct it. Go to the emerge and request an X-ray to be done and get cleared by a physician. Ice should not have contact with skin for more then 20 minutes at a time as necrosis of tissue will occur. No one at the hospital will put a cast on a broken toe but if your toe is broken you need to prevent contracture or else wearing any of your current shoes might become uncomfortable when your toe heals. You can buy a finger splinter at Shoppers which you can modify to fit over your fifth toe. You would have to wear sandals for a month if you decide to  go this route. Since most of toe fractures occur during summer, wearing sandals is not an inconvenience"
863003,bigbuck,2014-07-14 12:46:00,2449,"Don't screw around, go to emerg and have it x rayed and looked at. You do not want any problems later because you did not go in."
863006,Beans,2014-07-14 14:57:00,3339,Yep...get to emerg and have it x-rayed...They might just tape it and prescribe a pain-killer but at least you will know the extent of the damage...
863012,Roy,2014-07-14 16:36:00,13728,"Yeah, and bring Ralphie with you. Maybe they can do something about the toe print in his forehead."
863014,paul_614,2014-07-14 16:41:00,168,    Too soon?
863019,Joey,2014-07-14 17:48:00,9122,"Hahahahaha, I was reading about how to take care of a broken pinky toe and someone mentioned their couch did a smackdown on their toe.  Made me laugh.

863034,davey buoy,2014-07-14 18:59:00,5505,"I'm thinking it's not broken or you still would not be able to walk on it without a cast.Mine was a bad sprain,looked broken,blue and swollen terrible ,doc said little ice and you would be a lot better in a couple days.When I broke my foot ,that was pain for the best part of two weeks.Hoping a bad sprain is all you have."
863041,misfish,2014-07-14 19:47:00,29133,I might suggest you paint on glow in the dark nail polish J. You can see where your walking.  Sorry for the pain. Looks nasty girl.
863049,kickingfrog,2014-07-14 20:17:00,8333,I moved a coffee table about a foot and a half with my big toe in the dark. No broken bones but the ligaments are still sore months later. More pain then any turf toe I had playing sports.
