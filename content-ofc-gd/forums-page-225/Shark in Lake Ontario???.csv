863388,Roy,2014-07-16 15:20:00,13728,It's obvious...it has her nose....
863390,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-16 15:29:00,10439,It's obvious...it has her nose....  And her gigantic !!!!
863394,JoshS,2014-07-16 17:07:00,729,I'd say cat too.. if it's a real video from the area. It's crazy how things blow up on the internet!
863399,John Bacon,2014-07-16 17:52:00,3277,I would have to agree that the body shape looks more like a dolphin or porpoise than a fish.  The way its back arches would make me think it has a whale type tail rather than a vertical tail like a fish.
863401,AKRISONER,2014-07-16 18:00:00,5558,sturgeon?
863405,GbayGiant,2014-07-16 18:58:00,1780,If you use a big screen. You can easily see the teeth on it. Look at the Slow Mo. They are easily visible.
863407,leaf4,2014-07-16 19:13:00,2466,Apparently it's in the Kingston area... Wolfe island? And big sandy bay beach according to this article which also believes it's a harbour porpoise  http://ww2.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/2014/07/15/possible-shark-sighting-in-lake-ontario-greeted-with-fear-and-scepticism

863435,fishing n autograph,2014-07-16 21:08:00,2540,Yup well done discovery channel! They did it to promote shark week
863447,cram,2014-07-16 22:46:00,1733,"Nice.  Certainly got the conversations going.  Speaking of animal sightings......had some sort of weasel in my backyard in Oakville today.  Dark brown throughout (didn't see a white belly, though i could have just missed it).   Not very big (maybe 1.5 feet long including tail).  I'm a couple of blocks up from the lake so not exactly far, but not close either. Any ideas?"

863467,fishing n autograph,2014-07-17 01:15:00,2540,Or a city councillor
863469,OhioFisherman,2014-07-17 01:23:00,6623," probably a mink  This, I actually had a couple of them wander thru my yard a couple of years ago, they are even rarer here."
863473,cram,2014-07-17 01:38:00,1733,"Or a city councillor Ha....or our MPP.  I think it's a mink though, based on pics.  Just kind of surprised as we aren't that close to the water."
863494,mosquito,2014-07-17 03:23:00,111,"Could the weasel actually be a squirrel?  The ones around here seem to have shed and look something like a weasel with a skinny tail and the one today was walking and I thought it was a weasel of some kind until it got closer and I could clearly see it.    Now this is what a shark taking a fish off a fishing line in fresh water REALLY looks like...but nowhere near the St. Lawrence.     http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/natsci/ichthyology/Gallery/Descript/bullshark/bullshark.htm Bull Sharks have been found hundreds of miles up rivers but not so far north, St Louis Miss. is the farthest north in a freshwater river I heard of...  but with global warming and the asian carps.... hmmmm    I'll pass, I was snorkelling in the Cayman Islands and had a reef shark longer than me make a few approaches and when the third time he got less than 10' away I was out of the water!  I'll stick to watching them at the local aquarium store or at Mandarin restaurant... still want to get down to Ripley's aquarium but no interest in getting that close again with nothing more than my little camera.   They have some sharks with tags and it is interesting to see where some of them travel.  There is one Lydia, a 14' great white, that started out on the East Coast went almost to Ireland and is now down by Florida. http://www.ocearch.org/"
863496,dhickey,2014-07-17 03:50:00,1038,Send it off to River Monsters.... He will sort it out. :rofl2:
863497,cram,2014-07-17 04:05:00,1733,"Not a squirrel, mosquito.  This was less than 15 feet for me and froze, with a birch tree behind it. Then ran along the hedge for 20 feet.   Got a really good look."
863519,Mike Pike,2014-07-17 11:57:00,1332,"Got me!  Oh well, at least I was right about ONE thing.. it wasn't a catfish!  lol"

863278,John Bacon,2014-07-15 22:05:00,3277,That is what the story says.  Does anybody recognize the scenery?  I have no way of know where the video was shot.  The frame seems too narrow; kind of like they were trying to prevent anyone from recognizing the location.  http://www.variety104.com/2014/07/14/real-or-fake-shark-in-lake-ontario/

863289,kickingfrog,2014-07-15 22:50:00,8333,Carp.

863292,bushart,2014-07-15 23:04:00,2628,C'mon boys......Atlantic  Truly I thought cat as well   But some may know of the story where a great white swam up a river in New Jersey in the early 1900's and lived there in fresh water for a while----and killing more than a few swimmers...some children
863297,Dave Bailey,2014-07-15 23:21:00,1641,"A bull shark was once caught in the Mississippi at Alton, Illinois. They can get quite far inland."
863301,Christopheraaron,2014-07-15 23:49:00,3525,"Possible but really what would it be? That fish doesn't appear to be nearly large enough for a great white or bull shark. Dorsal is too high for a carp as well, my money is on cat."
863305,John Bacon,2014-07-16 00:26:00,3277,"There are bull sharks in the St Lawrence, so maybe....  Yeah, Mallorytown is getting pretty close to the lake.  The video didn't really look right; but you never know...  http://lostswimming.com/2014/02/03/ministry-confirms-bull-sharks-in-st-lawrence/"

Not saing this is real, but if the above post is correct and there are reported bull sharks in the St lawrance, then i dont see why there couldn't be any in Lake O.  I saw this video a week ago and it claimed to be shot in the kingston area...."
863361,Dave Bailey,2014-07-16 12:58:00,1641,"Just watched it again, and I can't tell if the snout is pointed or not. The shape of the fin and the ridge behind it seems more like some species of cetacean. The closest occurring whale to Lake Ontario would probably be the beluga, but they don't have a dorsal fin."

863370,Mike Pike,2014-07-16 14:01:00,1332,"Doesn't look anything like a catfish to me.  The slowed-down footage, as poor as it is, looks like a bull shark, and it's possible because they can survive in fresh water.   But like Dave Bailey said, the ridge behind the dorsal seems more whale-like.  So  now I'm confused..."
863371,Roy,2014-07-16 14:07:00,13728," ?  Better pictures would have been nice. But better pictures would have proven it was a channel cat. That's why clear pics of UFOs, Nessie and bigfoot don't exist."
863372,Sinker,2014-07-16 14:08:00,8692,"You guys can laugh if you want, but while duck hunting lake ontario last winter, I swear we watched whales breeching the surface many miles offshore. I've seen whales many, many times, and what we saw sure looked to be whales. You could see the spray with naked eyes, but thru binoculars, you could see the whole animal coming out of the surface, with a puff of spray each time they breeched.  Craziest thing I ever saw, and there were 5 of us who witnessed this.  S."
