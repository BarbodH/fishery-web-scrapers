863945,Ralph Field,2014-07-20 16:52:00,1018,"I liked him in Maverick and again in Rockford, and also enjoyed him in his movie roles."
863955,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-20 17:34:00,8243,"Has to be Maverick. I was a kid running around in all black playing Cowboys and Indians when Maverick was on. He was a great actor and his comedic timing was bang on. As the article said he was one of the first, maybe the first "" movie star "" to cross over to TV. Something frowned upon then and sometimes even today for a ""film star"".  One cool guy. Punched out his step mother because she had it coming, try that today.  RIP James Garner."
