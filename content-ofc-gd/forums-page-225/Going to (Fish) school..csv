863671,Bernie,2014-07-18 12:05:00,3190,About 20 years ago my step daughter and her friend went fishing in the bay here with a bunch of worms. Knowing they would like to catch something I pointed them out to catch catfish here in the bay.They returned with a livewell jam packed with catfish.They had a blast catching them. They still mention it from time to time.There may be a bag or two of them still at the bottom of the freezer
