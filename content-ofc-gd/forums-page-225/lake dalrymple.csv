I've only shore fished at the narrows, but I'm sure others will know some spots.  You could also try the Dalrymple section at the Kawartha Anglers board, I don't think you have to be a member to just look: http://www.kawarthaanglers.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=47&sid=4218d5a2366b5832992ed018b654cf81"
