863679,SirCranksalot,2014-07-18 12:53:00,3291,I'm a bit puzzled. We went there on Wed. Fish lots of areas that looked like prime bass territory. Just saw 2 other fishermen the whole day but all we caught was a few dinks. Has anybody fish that area and did you have any luck? thx

Fished some of the S Shore on the way back. as I said, it looked like prime territory to us with minimal fishing pressure---weed beds, rocky areas next to deep water etc. So we were a bit taken aback to just catch a few dinks"
