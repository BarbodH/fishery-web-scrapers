From what i have read, smallies are in their but lack size and no pike.  Is their a specfic lake thats not too distant that would be worth trailing over to one morning? Ive never fished or even driven to this area of haliburton,  usually stick to gbay and kawarthas for my fishing excursion.  Was considering leaving my boat at home but it will be too nice of a weekend.  Thanks."

It is not listed as a species for that lake, so guessing someone may have been doing some private stocking.  Here is my post on that -> http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=55809&hl=redstone"
