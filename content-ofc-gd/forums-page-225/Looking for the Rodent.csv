Pros: They're the softest plastic (good for action/fish biting and holding) of the 5 or 6 beaver type baits that I've tried. Strong coffee scent. Good tenticle/tail action. Can be fished weighted or weightless.  Cons: The tenticles get torn off really easy from panfish.  Especially the side tenticles.  Great action on them while they last. The get torn at the tip the easiest of all beaver type baits I've used.
