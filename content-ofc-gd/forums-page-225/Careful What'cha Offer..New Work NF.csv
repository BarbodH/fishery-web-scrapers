863741,bushart,2014-07-18 20:28:00,2628,Ok--life used to be a whole lot easier when all's I had to do was go to the store and buy a canvas---then paint  Soooo...Get this bright idea to offer something different in the cedar sandblasted sign biz---now most providers usually can offer your typical loon....muskoka chair....lighthouse...etc......generic type stuff  So BraveBrush here says---hey I can paint whatever ya want---just to offer something different...well then someone takes ya up on it  So a nice lady asked for.......Rolling hills....stone fence.......man walking behind plow.....chestnut/brown draught horse complete with harness and red collar....log barn complete with side door...  the lettering/horse and barn blasted nice---it did kinda turn out cool---but was a little more involved than say...a canoe  Of course I blurred their last name for here  So it was pretty much a painting---so ...here's a new work  
863746,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-18 20:55:00,336,Love it!  You have really captured a Canadian feel of hard work and solitude.
863748,bushart,2014-07-18 20:58:00,2628,Thanks Pikeslayer---actually I live in an area where every once in a while you'll see someone working fields still by horse
863749,misfish,2014-07-18 21:03:00,29133, Thats hard work living.  Nice Terrance. As always.
863753,bushart,2014-07-18 21:17:00,2628,Thanks Bri
863756,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-18 21:46:00,29,That's pretty cool. Old-world style craftsmanship is night and day against mass-produced generics.
863759,bushart,2014-07-18 22:02:00,2628,Thanks Bass Hunter Ottawa........It may be the case----and some of us aging brush jockeys are still kicking the can  But in this technological age....attention spans grow shorter---and we are a dying breed  Oh well--time moves on...not too many blacksmiths on every corner anymore either

My Dad grew up on a small farm in  Saskatchewan in the 30's and they pulled the plow with a team of Clydesdales and as soon as I saw your painting I thought of him.  Used to know the name of his horses but darned if I can think of them now, but it seems to me one was Tess."

Right on Lew  My uncle had one of these--was called ""Claude""  When I was a kid-my cousin and I-- ""hilled"" a potatoe field with a horse"
