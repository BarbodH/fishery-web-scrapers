This past spring I did a little trout fishing on the creek using small spinners, quik-fish crank baits mostly I caught some decent fish landed some rainbows and had much more fun than sitting inside! Finally walleye opener then bass opener came. I got out once or twice prior to bass opener and caught some walleye on each trip, not many but a few every time on buck tails and crank baits.  I went up to Rice with a friend of mine and had a great bass opener, we were fishing a team style tournament the next day. We caught a few nice bass at each spot on Saturday did the milk run the next day and the fish were gone, it was a tough go but late afternoon I managed to pop 3 largies on the frog and swinging hammer swim bait and we got to weigh in some bass, was a great experience can't wait to do it again next year!  Here we go on our way to the launch   Before blasting off, my friends dad was nice enough to lend the boat for the day. What a cool design for a deep v aluminum 19' if I remember right. Blast off time!   Here are some pics from my most recent trip out. First of the morning, I'm trying to catch some largies and were finding walleye haha   And another, this one was over the slot I believe by a inch or 2   Here is my friend from the shop who brought me out with a 25"" Walleye, such a blast on the heavy line and TRJ, his first ever he put the buck tail down after I caught the first 2    We tucked into a channel later in the day and caught a dozen or so largies all a between 1 and 2lbs had a blast, here was one of the nicer largies on the swim bait.    Well that's it for now, we were out again this past week and caught just 5 or 6 bass no walleye and I landed a decent Musky. I'm about 2 1/2 weeks away from my annual camping and fishing trip, 2 weeks on this one so stay tuned for a report on August 17th  Get out there while summer is still here!  Tightlines  MTBF"
