863414,bushart,2014-07-16 19:43:00,2628,Well The King is Dead.......Long live the king!  My ole Lowrance X85 has gone to finder heaven...Actually my transducer calved and I can no longer replace it  Now I bought this is 97---it has served me extremely well---and I was used to what it told me and how it was displayed    So now when I go to replace---the room starts to spin-----gps--navionics---maps-----DSI  Wow...all's I wanted was what I had---hard to find---I even called Lowrance CS in the USA  So I know it's not the prettiest on the shelf...but it's what I just ordered from LeBarons---I think this old dog just does'nt want to learn those new tricks...and I hope it's close to being as good as my old one   http://www.lowrance.com/en-US/Products/Fishfinder/Mark5xPro-en-us.aspx

863419,bushart,2014-07-16 20:08:00,2628,"I know why you bought that one Terrance.  It,s black and white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  RIP X85 you served him well.   Ch'ya...jus like ma tv in the libbenroom  Actually I won a few bets with my 85 on me sayin what the species we were lookin at---course they had to get caught  Apparently now with DSI---ya can tell the fish's last bowel movement   ---takes away all the guesswork  old habits die hard i reckon"
863573,Sinker,2014-07-17 17:59:00,8692,"They still mark the same fish. Don't get caught up in the fancy schmancy new gizmos. The old school graphs still work just as good at marking fish, and if you know what your looking at, you will know when its fish and not weeds or other crap down there.  I use an X96 thru the ice, and I mark the exact same fish as a guy with a top of the line flasher, but I saved my self a few hundred bucks.  All that said, I have a fancy unit on my boat, but solely for the GPS Mapping. Its slick as snot on a doorknob.    S."
863576,ratherboutdoors,2014-07-17 18:19:00,132,I'v got 2 or 3 hours playing with buttons on my new Elite 5 HDI and I'm still not sure if I'm off demo mode   LOL!  you likely made the right choice.

863604,bushart,2014-07-17 20:59:00,2628,I still have my X85 and it is still flawless. I hear ya---if I coulda got another transducer---I would have kept it for sure
863607,Roy,2014-07-17 21:15:00,13728,You still have the unit? A ducer might be available.
863609,Terry,2014-07-17 21:40:00,14456,my my X85 was a fine unit
863613,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-17 22:11:00,10439,You should be able to find a 'ducer for it on that auction site.  I'm still rocking my LMS-350 that I bought in the mid 90's.
863614,bushart,2014-07-17 22:15:00,2628,You still have the unit? A ducer might be available. yes---but now i've ordered the new one  if you want it for a spare Roy---I'll give it to ya--let me know
863616,porkpie,2014-07-17 22:46:00,2521,"X85 was a fine unit, I used one for quite some time.  IMHO, color is a whole new world though!  Enjoy your sonar, it will do just fine!"
