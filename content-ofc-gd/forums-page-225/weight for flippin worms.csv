862941,beertech,2014-07-13 23:13:00,118,what weight does everyone using for flipping worm.   i was flipping a power worm on the weekend and was having troubles with it birdsnesting ect.  by the way im new to this.
862946,Musky or Specks,2014-07-13 23:34:00,2710,I have always used Gambler Florida rig weight  http://www.protacklesolutions.com/products/gambler-florida-rig
862951,Christopheraaron,2014-07-14 00:34:00,3525,"I'll just go with a 1/8 oz bullet weight, sometimes with a nail knot above to stop it from sliding."
862955,Garnet,2014-07-14 00:41:00,2056,Over a season from 1/8- 1.5.  Most 7-10 inch power worms 3/16-1/2.  Birdsnesting is improper baitcaster setup.
862992,OhioFisherman,2014-07-14 07:51:00,6623,Sparse cover? 3/16ths - 1/4 ounce. Punching thru cover? up to 1 ounce.
862994,Terry,2014-07-14 09:20:00,14456,I use the lightest I can that will get through the weeds 1/8 to over an ounce
862995,HTHM,2014-07-14 09:57:00,4082,Lightweight baits are best thrown with a spinning rig rather than a baitcaster.
863007,Terry,2014-07-14 15:36:00,14456,"Well he said flipping. And I will take a baitcaster over spinning everytime If I am doing a real flip , the size of weight does not change the way I flip it."
863039,misfish,2014-07-14 19:43:00,29133,"would be correct. I have yet to see him switch up to a spinning reel. Flipp,n and pitch,n are two different things here,but I can do both with a bait caster. I use a pitching caster. It has a locking devise.Press the trigger when pitching. When the bait hits the water,release the trigger and it,s locked in for quick hook sets."
863045,dracokaos,2014-07-14 20:05:00,116,if your getting backlashes when your flipping it is more of a reel set up then the size of the weight. What I usually do every time I switch bait is once the air is tied on I hold the rod about a 45degree angle from the water and hit the release button and let the bait fall without touching the spool. If it backlashes then I adjust the spool tension knob until it stops pulling line just as it hits the water.  This usually works for me and I only get the bird nests if I'm not paying attention...  Hope this works for you  Cheers
863246,fishindevil,2014-07-15 20:26:00,6254,I use tungsten weights ya expensive & heavy but they are small and punch right through no problem even 1/40z is great for punching the junk
863253,davey buoy,2014-07-15 20:39:00,5505,"Call me crazy,I have my adjustments all backed off. Great casts,but have to remember your thumb at the same time as your drop. Baitcasters are the ticket IMO."
863256,Terry,2014-07-15 20:50:00,14456,he must be pitching not flipping  flipping you really can't get a birds nest cause you keep the line in your left hand and wind the worm letting out the line you have in your had no reason to release the spool  now pitching you release the spool holding with our thumb  and pitch the lure out ..if you are really pitching you don't need a lot of line so on your first pitch let out an extra 20ft and put tape around your spool  you will never get a bad birds nest while pitching
863332,Peps,2014-07-16 02:00:00,191,Tungsten is all I use. The feel with tungsten is far better than with a lead weight. Use a bobber stop to keep it from sliding
863347,Garnet,2014-07-16 10:41:00,2056,"About 90% Tungsten, still go to a few lakes were pike really like T rig. At these places Lead (pennys) tungsten (dollars) ."
