862758,TJQ,2014-07-12 17:44:00,7806,"Well.. were over half way there.. so I thought Id share our progress.  In June when we went in to camp we were met with our worst nightmare, not one, but both camps had succumbed to the snow load.  The big tent had been up for 7 years and we had never had a problem.  I was surprised to see the small one down as it was even better supported.        Well...  it didn't take long for me to decide to turn these lemons into lemonade.  I know it would be a big task...  but as the song goes... ""I get by with a little help from my friends"" and I called in some favours... (som BIGGG favours)   lord knows I owe some people big time now... hahaha.  So Monique and I went in, and managed to reconstruct the damaged little toad hut, and put everything we could salvage in it.  It wasn't good enough to sleep in. but would keep stuff dry at least.   Then we cleared the big platform.  I spent the next weekend with the task of starting to bring material in the 4km (8 km round trip) 4 wheeler trip in.  I think Ive done 20 or so trips so far.    With the deck cleared we began construction, Joe and I and the girls for a couple of weekend and then we brought in another heavy hitter Marc.  The last four days were rainy and crappy but man did we all giver.   Its pretty much closed in now, and i can go up to do the soffit and electrical and fireplace inside outta the bugs.  Here some pictures as the construction progressed.  Oh yes... and we fit Jadens prom in there as well...          Looking out the window.  sorta...  Walls up!      We did get some fishing in too!            New kitchen wall    Nights were well lubricated and connected.. lol    Put a nice little loft in.....  where i can hide...    Getting the roof on....  (crap that's scary... lol)    and were done for a bit!!  "
862760,Joey,2014-07-12 17:49:00,9122,"What a great job TJ.   Sucks that the snow blew it out, but Jiggy will be better than ever now!!!  And congrats to Jaden, she looks Maaaaaavelous!"
862787,Joeytier,2014-07-12 20:25:00,3990,Wow looks great!  Hopefully you can spend the rest of the summer enjoying the fruits of your (well lubricated) labour
862788,misfish,2014-07-12 20:35:00,29133,"Ok,Im ready to move in. Whats the going rate for live in chef?  Nice boss."
862789,Rod Caster,2014-07-12 21:17:00,5784,That prom photo is one of the funniest things I've seen on here. Can't imagine what you'll be sporting at her wedding
862793,lew,2014-07-12 21:52:00,12766,"The snow did alot of damage everywhere last winter but it sure looks like you brought Jiggy back together with some great work TJ, the place looks really impressive now.  Can't believe how much Jaden has grown and that picture is hilarious"

862824,bigbuck,2014-07-13 11:42:00,2449,"The place is looking better, at the rate you are going, in 10 years you will have a luxury 3000sq ft mansion on the property....lol. with a real roof now, you should not have to worry too much about the snow load any longer."

863428,misfish,2014-07-16 20:51:00,29133,"  Ill only charge you a couple hundred a day!   Guess you forgot about those great venison and moose burgers I cooked for the you and the gang on that RED X BBQ, that you used for many years later eh?"
863433,TJQ,2014-07-16 21:07:00,7806,"  Guess you forgot about those great venison and moose burgers I cooked for the you and the gang on that RED X BBQ, that you used for many years later eh?  I could NEVER forget that!!  As a matter of fact that BBQ still gets a good workout at camp cooking steaks and heating up the water for the sauna!!  Its been a work horse.  So ok  I guess you can come up and cook.. lol.. Do you take Canadian Tire money.. lol.. cause thats all i have left now...."
