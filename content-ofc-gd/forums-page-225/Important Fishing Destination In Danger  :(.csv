862892,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-13 17:46:00,10439,Got some disturbing news on Friday. Seems one of the fires burning here in the NWT is getting too close to Plummers Great Slave Lake Lodge. They evacuated the guests on Saturday as well as most of the staff. This weeks guests have been shipped up to the lodge on Great Bear.  The fire is within 1km of the lodge right now and the wind is gusting to 60k here in town.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/n-w-t-fishing-lodge-evacuated-due-to-forest-fire-1.2705205  Over 3000 square miles of the NWT have burnt already this year.
