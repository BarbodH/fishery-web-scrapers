In April of this year, I observed that the burner has no noticeable degradation from the day I bought it.  The starter still works on the 1st or 2nd push 95 % of the time.  As for Webers being overpriced and overrated and being made of flimsy materials - I disagree.   With the exception of their entry level grill - The Spirit, which is made in Asia, their grills are manufactured in the USA with some of the sturdiest materials available in their class.  Napoleon and Vermont Castings grills are also very nice.  I also have a Weber Performer Charcoal grill and I love using it as well.  As far as limiting ones self to $400, I'd save up until I could buy a better grill.  You won't regret it."

928755,KraTToR,2015-08-10 19:30:00,506,"Charcoal all the way. If you're on gas or propane, you're just pretending to bbq. By definition, yes .  Gas is Grillin'. Charcoal is BBQ.  I have a Weber Summit NG and a Lg Big Green Egg.  I use both all year round and for very different reasons.  For example, if I spend big $$ on a dry aged steak I use the gas grill as charcoal imparts its own unique flavour, which IMHO, masks the  nutty/beefy flavour you get from dry aged beef.  Supermarket steaks get either, depending on what I'm in the mood for.  For pork, especially heritage breed such as square nail or berkshire, charcoal turns them into something remarkable.  One other point, if you keep the egg clean and somewhat free from ash, you can get it up to 700 deg in about 15 mins.  About the same as pre-heating a gas grill.. just a bit more upfront work and cleaning.  PM me if you want any specific details ."

Weber bought out Ducane years ago and with that went my ""Life Time Warranty""...Weber is more then happy to sell you over priced parts though. BTW I paid over $1000.00 for that grill because of it's ""Life Time Warranty"".....  This time we went with a KitchenAid gas grill that I quickly transformed to accept Natural Gas instead of propane. Kitchen Aid gives you the orifice need  to change out for the side burner and then you just remove the propane orifices because the Natural Gas orifices are already installed behind the propane orifices....nice way to handle this...
