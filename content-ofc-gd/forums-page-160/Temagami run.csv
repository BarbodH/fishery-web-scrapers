Eyes are extremely tough to catch in August unless you're far in the southern arm of the lake. I abandon walleye fishing completely during this month. If you're going to try, 8-dusk is prime time (somewhat late compared to the usual).  Lakers are always a sure bet provided you have the setup. Use live bait."

Mostly stayed in the shade until the evening fish. Ended up plucking some bass for a fish feed, as the pickeral just werent on for those couple days."
