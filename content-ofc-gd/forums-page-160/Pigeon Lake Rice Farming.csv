931046,Sinker,2015-08-24 17:19:00,8692,"In my experience in the south end of sturg, the rice gets less and less every year. I know pigeon has tons of it, but its nowhere near any reserves. Wild rice isnt a bad thing. Its excellent cover, and waterfowl love it!  S."
931052,Tom McCutcheon,2015-08-24 17:37:00,627,"I have to agree with Sinker, wild rice makes excellent cover and waterfowl do love it. However the location where it is being harvested and reseeded is a long way from the local reserve. The reseeding has literally plugged a number of navigable channels and choked off the mouth of bays so there is very little turn over of fresh water. Whether it turns over from wind/wave action or runoff from nearby small feeder creeks, the bays are becoming stagnant and breeding grounds for mosquitos only."
931414,John Bacon,2015-08-26 21:52:00,3277,Here is another article on the topic.  http://www.mykawartha.com/opinion-story/5812878-in-the-pigeon-lake-wild-rice-dispute-this-man-is-on-the-side-of-the-rice-and-the-first-nation-comm/;send=false
931447,Tom McCutcheon,2015-08-27 01:02:00,627,"The area seen from the aerial photo is just a little further north than the entrance to the bay I am on. The rice extends south for about another 1/4 of a mile and is extremely thick. Entrance to our bay used to be approx. 100yds wide, now it is just wider than 20 feet, and filling in further each week. Mr. Jones makes some valid points, and no one, especially myself could argue the persecution of natives in the past. However that occurred a number of generations ago and I was always taught that you can not change what has already happened, but you can change what you can do now and for the future. Nothing gets fixed unless you have open minds on BOTH sides of a negotiation table.  Perhaps if Mr. Whetung had asked for guidance prior to operating his mechanical harvesting and reseeding, we may have been able to come to a better solution than just going ahead with his selfish plans and screw everyone else. I am sure there would have been some opposition to his enterprise from some cottagers, (I am not that naïve) but compromises could have been reached."
931522,jimmer,2015-08-27 14:46:00,2730,"I think that people concerned about the rice should not be put into the same category as the other issues (listed in the mykawartha article) that have faced the First Nations over the past 200+ years. That being said, this is the Kawarthas Lakes not the Muskoka Lakes, we should all be used to the weed growth and changes that takes place over the years. I curse the stuff, but also realize its importance."
931531,crappieperchhunter,2015-08-27 15:56:00,2582,Had no idea it was being planted...but driving up to Bobcaygeon every weekend it is very noticable just how much it has taken over large areas of the lake.  Lots of waterfront cottages have a better looking lawn then I do...to bad its actually wild rice   If I was one of those home or cottage owners I'd be upset as well because you no longer have a nice lake to look at and I'm sure it has decreased your property value quite a bit as well.  James Whetung  should be allowed to harvest the old traditional way or not at all IMHO.
931600,fishindevil,2015-08-27 20:57:00,6254,"the wild rice has doubled in the last 20yrs easily.....emily creek on sturgeon lake is almost chocked right off now,and there hardly used to be any years ago,it was just bullrushes,but not now the lakes sure are in bad shape thats for sure...."
930787,John Bacon,2015-08-22 19:57:00,3277,"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/property-owners-first-nations-square-223246501.html  There's a battle brewing between property owners on a lake in Ontario's Kawartha region and a First Nations group using the lake bed to seed and harvest rice. At the centre of the dispute is Pigeon Lake, located north of Peterborough near Bobcaygeon. Larry Wood, whose family has lived on the lake for more than 70 years, told CBC News the problem began about six years ago when a local man began seeding rice in the lake. Wood, who says he is joined by more than 200 families opposed to the planting of rice on Pigeon Lake, says the rice has now spread from ""shore to shore"" choking out other plants and hindering recreational uses of the lake. ""If this is allowed to continue, Pigeon Lake as we know it will no longer exist,"" Wood told CBC News. Wood is careful to point out that wild rice has grown in the lake for decades; a small patch has flourished near his property for as long as he can remember. But what he and a group of property owners are opposed to is the seeding of rice plants in the lake. Images his group has posted on the 'Save Pigeon Lake' website show rice plants growing over a large area on the lake — from above, it looks like a farmer's field. He said the rice farming benefits one business owner to the detriment of all other lake users. ""It definitely is a commercial enterprise,"" said Wood. ""No person should have the right to create their own fields to raise their own crop to sell something commercially that he personally grew in public waters."" Rice grower unapologetic James Whetung of the Curve Lake First Nation is unapologetic. He plants and harvests the rice, selling it for $12 a pound under the brand name Black Duck Wild Rice. He says that it feeds his community. He sees the issue as one of aboriginal sovereignty and aboriginal peoples' right to access traditional foods. ""They hate me and what I'm doing. And they hate my people,"" said Whetung. He says landowners accost him and call police when his family tries to harvest the rice. ""They don't want to see Indians getting rich and they use us for scapegoats for all their problems,"" he said. ​Whetung says his people have gathered rice long before the cottagers came to the area. ""Why don't we kick them all off and take it all back,"" he said. After spending three years lobbying various government bodies to prevent rice seeding on the lake, Wood said he and a group of neighbours were issued a permit by Parks Canada, which administers the Trent Severen Waterway, to ""harvest aquatic weeds"" from the lake at the end of July. A private company was hired to remove the rice from shoreline areas using a harvesting machine similar to a combine. The weed harvesting was halted after a few days when a local First Nations group complained, arguing they weren't consulted about the removal of the rice, which is typically harvested in September. ""It's our right to harvest and gather so if any permits are given it should come through First Nations and not the Canadian government,"" said James Marsden, the chief of Alderville First Nation. Parks Canada officials are planning to meet with First Nations groups next week to hear their side of the dispute and possibly reach a compromise. Wood says property owners are ""very upset"" that the removal of planted rice was halted. He said they're also frustrated by a lack of clarity about which government body has jurisdiction. ""When they bought their properties, none of this rice was here,"" said Wood."
930797,Tom McCutcheon,2015-08-22 20:56:00,627,"I live on Pigeon Lake and when I bought my waterfront property (small bay off the main lake) in 2003, I could see clear out to the lake from my dock. Bass, panfish and the occasional muskie could be caught from my dock. In the last four years since the rice has choked off the mouth of the bay, the water flow is now minimal and the water is almost stagnant at my dock. There is very little oxygen left and the spawning beds which used to be prolific, are covered in silt. This all due to the planting and mechanical harvesting of rice. I have a problem with Mr. Whetung's statement that we all hate them. I don't have a problem with natives harvesting rice the traditional way, from canoes. When we have to put up with the constant roar all day long of an air boat equipped to harvest rice, and when he plants said rice in areas where it never was in the past, I have a problem with that. This has only just begun to heat up."

930856,esoxansteel,2015-08-23 15:18:00,1307,"Wild Rice is not an invasive specie, it was here many years ago, and provided Indiginous people with a healthy food, Wild Rice likely seen its demise with the flooding of the lands (Native Lands) when the Trent System was built. What James is essentially doing is bringing back a Native species, to both again feed his people. Which is the same as the MNR re-introducing Atlantics, and Lake Trout to Lake Ontario, and muskies to Lake Simcoe, which again use to populate both Lakes in numbers. Re-introducing Native species is nothing new, Rice Lake is called Rice Lake for one reason only. When species used to populate an area, and become non-existent, in the area they used to populate, it is 100% because of the white mans interference through globalization. There was No endangered species, or invasive species when Natives were the caretakers of the lands period."
930864,Tom McCutcheon,2015-08-23 15:48:00,627,So what your saying Steve is that the areas that are being planted with rice now are the same areas that sustained wild rice years ago? These same areas that were meadows and cedar bush lots? What James is doing is harvesting in a non traditional method which allows him to harvest more profit in a season. He has decided on his own to expand his crops.
930867,smitty55,2015-08-23 15:54:00,928,"I don't think you will find many people who believe that natives are the best caretakers of OUR resources. One only has to look at Nippissing  or Lac Milles Lacs or even the history of lake Erie to see evidence of that. And to think that the white man's interference is responsible for all of this is totally ludicrous. I have absolutely no problem with native rights, to a point, but in many cases it goes way too far, just like your extremist attitude. This planting of wild rice that affects so many people and damages the lake itself is just another example of certain groups thinking they can do anything they want."
930869,dave524,2015-08-23 15:59:00,4508,A species does not necessarily have to be an introduced species to be invasive. I was taught years ago that invasive species can also be a native species that colonizes an area to the point that they threaten the natural biodiversity of an ecosystem.
930895,glen,2015-08-23 20:03:00,2641,$12 per lb.  i need a rice harvester.  Is this on native land? Or who owns the water?
930897,John Bacon,2015-08-23 20:14:00,3277,"There was No endangered species, or invasive species when Natives were the caretakers of the lands period.  I wouldn't go that far.  There are several extinct species such as wholly mamoths, sabre tooth cats, etc. that were present when the first nations first arrived in North America.  It is possible that first nations peoples caused, or at least played a part, in their demise."

How is that not considered blatant racism, fear mongering and hate breeding?"
931004,captpierre,2015-08-24 12:56:00,2521,"I cottage on North Pigeon. No rice up here. Maybe on Little Bald.  Must be near the south end of Pigeon. The Curve Lake reserve is situated nearby between Chemong and Upper Buckhorn Lakes. I've been there many times. A fairly prosperous reserve,  looking at it from the outside. There is a wonderful  native art centre/gallery/museum called the Whetung Ojibwa Centre. Owned by the Whetung family. Same name of the fellow sewing the rice. Does the reserve claim rights to The Pigeon lake area?  Was this part of their original territory? Does anyone know about the local native history?"
931021,Big Cliff,2015-08-24 13:48:00,6899,"MNR in fact planted wild rice in Sturgeon lake to try to croud out some of the invasive species. The wild rice beds are expanding so fast you can almost watch them grow, in the last two or three years they have taken over huge areas. The wild rice then traps sediment which builds up over time and allows the wild rice to seed new areas.  We have a real battle going on here on Sturgeon Lake too however our fight is with the local municipality, they tax us on ""waterfront"" property and then if we want to clean out the weeds so we can swim or fish we have to jump through hoops and pay to get a permit.  I have no issues with native people wanting to harvest a natural resource, many members on here live off the land to some degree. I don't think they should have the right to cultivate areas where the rice wasn't established through natural means. Public land is just that for the use and enjoyment of all, no one people should be allowed to hamper the use of that land to the detriment of others."

I wouldn't be surprised if in a couple more years south pigeon will be choked off completely,every year there is less and less navigable water on south pigeon. Its always been choked but the rice is getting crazy"
931036,misfish,2015-08-24 16:11:00,29133,So how does one harvest the rice? Is it worth the effort to do so?
931037,glen,2015-08-24 16:18:00,2641,I saw it on tv once.  They had one guy paddle a canoe and the guy in the back had four foot poles.  He would bend the rice inside the canoe and hit it into a blanket on the bottom. Let's build a machine then we can get more.
931040,Big Cliff,2015-08-24 16:40:00,6899,"I saw it on tv once. They had one guy paddle a canoe and the guy in the back had four foot poles. He would bend the rice inside the canoe and hit it into a blanket on the bottom. Let's build a machine then we can get more. That is the traditional way of doing it and it works quite well if you are trying to harvest enough for a family or even a small group. When you consider that wild rice sells for about $12.00 a lb and two men can easily harvest 10 to 20 lbs in a couple of hours under good conditions there is money to be made. We usually just put a sheet of plastic in the bottom of the canoe and up the sides. You wouldn't use 100% wild rice in a recipe, it is too strong in flavor so you typically mix it with brown rice. Course, we use to dig potatoes by hand too but technology has made it much easier to make a living at it."
