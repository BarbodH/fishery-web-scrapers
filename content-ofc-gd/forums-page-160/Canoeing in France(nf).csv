LOL...I have been going there for over 20 years now, believe me, the fishing is painful. Anyway, it was a nice break from my norm, and I love how my wife finds it hard to understand how I manage to not fish for 2 weeks without going insane, just makes me laugh at how bad a fishing addict she thinks (knows) I am!"
