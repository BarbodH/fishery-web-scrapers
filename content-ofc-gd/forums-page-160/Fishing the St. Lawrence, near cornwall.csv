930490,Cloudy15,2015-08-20 18:02:00,141,"Hey all, I am heading to a friends cottage for a couple of days on the the St.Lawrence near Cornwall,specifically Stanley Island.  I've never fished there before and was hoping for a little advice. I most likely only have a canoe to use, but I'm not afraid of a good long paddle to productive grounds. Also I am really not sure how canoe friendly the water is current and what not. I've been looking online for fishing maps and even basic depth charts, but have been coming up empty. I'm not sure why I am having so much trouble, it usually isn't a problem for smaller lakes.  I'd love to catch really just about any quality fish, bass, pickerel, muskie etc. My plain was to just drift and drop shot around the near by islands. Maybe try a little at night closer to shore for pickerel?  Any help or pointers to help me find some productive water would be greatly appreciated,  since I have limted time and have to paddle everywhere (most likely). It would be a huge help! Thanks!"
930496,mike rousseau,2015-08-20 18:18:00,4661,Stanly island is very close to plenty if great fishing for walleye bass and musky... It's smack in the middle of where I fish every day...  There's smallmouth right below the lighthouse on the north side of the island...  The current will be tough in a canoe tho  If you want some more help shoot me a pm... Let me know when your coming... Might have an open seat

Had access to a large boat and still found it tough to manage the current. Caught a few smallmouth bass on swim type jigs cast around rocks on deeper sides of island.  If you hook up with the offer above, you have it made."

I always bring a 5 pound weight with a couple of claw like pieces, to help control my drifts when I don't have an electric motor. Usually helps a fair bit, not sure that it will in this case."

Still a good friend with other Cornwall dude Kent B. here in Toronto. Met other Cornwall peeps Rochelle H. , Peter Hill, John Black et al...way back. in T.O.  Anyways, best fishing on island was on north side of channel. Rattle baits, swim jigs, and Rapalas in blk/slv thrown off big rocks produce bass. Good Luck!"
