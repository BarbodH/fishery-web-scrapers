930940,Garnet,2015-08-23 23:45:00,2056,I've fished in 3-4 different 20 ft Skeeters all ran nice good layout. The problem is Yamaha parts and good dealers. And of course if it's a U.S. motor no warranty.  Ranger 519 nice boat spent a lot of time looking for one this spring no success.  Did you see that Pro Craft on CBAF. Same boat I bought runs nice seeps gas compared to my old 6 carb merc.
