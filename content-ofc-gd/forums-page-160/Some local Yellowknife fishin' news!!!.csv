931486,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-27 07:22:00,8243,Very interesting. The comments section on that article lead me to a picture of the exact coloured Pike in 2010. Ah paste not working again. Scroll down the comments page and you will find it close to the end of the article.

931508,Dara,2015-08-27 13:00:00,3052,Thats kinda neat. We have a lake around here where the walleye have a blue flourecense  to them like that and it even comes off on your hands
931526,AKRISONER,2015-08-27 15:00:00,5558,"someone literally posted a thread with a photo of a pike with similar colouration here just last week.  Ive caught plenty of pike with Blue tones to them too, no one seems to know why they turn this colour though?"
931532,Cast-Away,2015-08-27 15:58:00,790,"Very freaky, could have been caught off of a nuke plant!"
931555,mr blizzard,2015-08-27 18:33:00,1589,"The biologists now think it could be M&Ms,,(smarties),,,""MELT IN YOUR MOUTH,,NOT IN YOUR HANDS""  :tease:"
931574,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-27 19:58:00,10439,I heard it was because the pike ate a discarded hi-lighter!!!
931583,mr blizzard,2015-08-27 20:26:00,1589,"And they said"" u cant smoke,,,,pike!"", guess he thought that hi lighter was a stogie  Good one Dave"
931585,dave524,2015-08-27 20:28:00,4508,"Looks very much like the coloration of a Bowfin when they are spawning, used to get them colored like that in the marsh at Long Point. Why a pike is colored up like that is a mystery."
931611,Sharkbait22,2015-08-27 22:03:00,297,As Craig is a fish bio I'm surprised they didn't keep it for a closer look. Pretty weird almost unnatural  colour. Wonder what the flesh looked like.
931616,grt1,2015-08-27 22:41:00,638,"just read the article on the cbc news web site, sure was a weird looking pike but where there is one there may be another or another pile of them guess the spot where that one was caught will be the next hot spot for that lake."
