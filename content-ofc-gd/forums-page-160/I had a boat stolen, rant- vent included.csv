If you don't find that exact one, would you recommend anyone else getting it?  Not really. It was cheap and is light but you get what you pay for.

931706,SuperDave,2015-08-28 16:28:00,204,"Been through this stuff enough to know you can't trust anyone. When I drive 401 or 400 and stop for food I always take all loose ends (tackle boxes, rods, and especially electronics ) off my rig and lock them in my truck. My boat is stored out of sight and also locked in the garage at home. Our family lost 1 boat/motor right from the dock and 1 motor right out of our driveway. Sucks that you lost your boat."
931415,misfish,2015-08-26 22:15:00,29133," It,s sad when this has to happen. Here I go with back in the day thing here and sorry about that.  When you got caught doing something wrong, you got an ass whopp,n. Man to man,man to young man. I know first hand when I was a young man and did a stupid thing, I got smacked up the side of the head. Told my pop, and he smacked up twice as hard. No police . Just the parties envolved.To bad todays ways make it so easy for those that wish to take whats not theirs and get away with it.  We see the ignorance out there. You just want to smack that person up side the head, but today, you get charged and they laugh in your face. Call you the looser. Ya were the looser alright. We have lost our rights as honest people. Those that do the crime these days, do little time and get out after a vacation of food and board, and even get paid when they get out.  What pisses me of the most is,theres no lets get these people on the right trail ( yes I know I am repeating myself ). Lets get them off the need to steal to supply their habits. Lets show them there is more to doing crime. No, It,s here you go, your free again and heres your pay. See you soon Im sure."
931420,grimsbylander,2015-08-26 22:48:00,3016,"Off track for sure but...I like the rest of you have all had things broken into and stolen. But if I measure that against the severity of the gun crimes in the US AND now Canada, I can honestly say I don't care. I'd donate the entire contents of all the thief's against me 10X if it would save the life of one innocent person from one of the THOUSANDS of murders and accidental deaths every year. I own guns and commit no crimes but am glad that neither of you or anyone else is allowed to carry. FishNAutographs, frankly speaking based on your profession I'm shocked that you would say that. You do realize that everyone else would get a gun too right? And that you can't be with all your loved ones 100% of the time to protect them? And that you would always be the fastest gun in the west? Maybe if you served in Detroit, Chicago or New Orleans, you wouldn't be so quick to hand out guns.  Chicago Times 2014: ""Chicago Police reported 390 murders through Dec. 20, while the Cook County medical examinerâ€™s office reported 410 homicides, including 16 fatal police shootings, during the same period. There have been at least 10 additional homicides and one fatal police shooting since then.""  Those 410 murder victims all had the right to bear arms. A lot of good it did them. And it doesn't appear that anyone is ""thinking twice"" about breaking and entering...instead, they armed up to the situation. People can pretend all they want that they're big and tough because they have guns; truth is, the criminals feel the exact same way so if it's a shoot out you want, you can have it. Ridiculous. The idea of modelling our laws to mirror the US and then expect to not suffer with the same level of crime which is rampant in US cities is nothing short of asinine.  Here's how US cities as compared to entire countries on gun murders Be careful what you wish for people."
931422,chris.brock,2015-08-26 22:53:00,4053,"I don't know if it was a civil suit or the crown Old Iron. A civil suit makes more sense but I will ask him.  I thought about it. I don't keep a gun and ammo easily accessible. The risks outweighed the benefits.  Oh yeah, there is a way to legally carry a restricted weapon (handgun) in the bush here in Ontario. There's some hoops to jump through though. I'm not going to post the ""how to"" here."
931423,Rod Caster,2015-08-26 23:19:00,5784,"I'd like a handgun for animal protection while walking in the bush only. My long gun is too long and my knife is too short. I don't know anyone who has ever been in a situation with another human where a gun was actually needed to solve it. If all of a sudden everyone in Canada was allowed to carry it would be absolute chaos hahaha (although actually not funny)  good idea closing that sled trail Chris. That's the first thing I'd do. Also consider fencing and other techniques like ink bombs or spy cameras or baiting them with worthless but shiny equipment or kerping a tiger (they'd probably steal that too).  Google spy cameras, they have some amazing pieces available now."

931460,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-27 01:46:00,8243,"This thread has taken a big turn. I can only comment on what  have seen personally. A few years ago I;m fishing in NY with some family that live there. My cousin that is 28 is getting into the van to go to town and get some minnows. as he is getting in to the van I see he has a small handgun on his belt under his shirt. what the hell is that thing for Tony? I have a conceal permit, For what I ask and he says because his job entails carrying cash on him. He delivers freaking Pizza's for God sakes. You need to carry a gun to buy minnows? This kid drinks too much, smokes too much and has small man syndrome. I always thought NY was the toughest place to get a gun permit let alone conceal. Maybe he didn't have a permit, I believe someone when they tell me something usually. But no way this kid should carry a gun,, legal or not. I did move from Hamilton when gunfire became a thing you heard weekly 15 years ago downtown behind city hall. The only gun deaths in my county in 15 years is 2 and both were hunting related accidents.  Last year I think it was a young woman's car broke down and her cell phone didn't work. She went onto the porch and knocked on the door. She was met by an elderly man that shot her dead. Philly I think. No way I want it any different than it is now where I live.  This debate can go on forever. If I need a gun to go out I move or as I do in Florida I don't go out after dark much anymore there, sad really, the streets change once the sun goes down there and everyone I know there has a gun, young and old."
931462,mr blizzard,2015-08-27 02:12:00,1589,"Chris simply wanted some help to find his property and to get some reassurance to calm his nerves, I don't think the use of firearms was the purpose of his thread, if someone wants to bring up a thread of firearms please do so, FishNAutographs tried to help, if I remember someone was not agreeing with a recent political thread but under the right pretext look where it went and how much has been learned"

931294,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-25 23:14:00,8243,"Any one can bring civil charges like an intruder that got the snot beat out of him. I kicked the crap out of a guy that insisted in drinking and driving, I forcibly took his keys away in the 90's. He tried to sue me for 100K. The case lasted one morning before the Judge threw him out. I represented myself and had 6 cops  and an Assistant Crown as witnesses and expert opinions.  I can't see the Crown charging a homeowner with assault for kicking the crap out of an intruder. Now shooting dead an unarmed intruder may be a different story. A homeowner in Hamilton across the street from Tim Horton's stadium shot dead a kid for stealing his tomatoes from his back yard in the early 80's. He waited in the dark armed with a shot gun. He was charged and was acquitted of most of the charges. He basically got away with murder. That would have a different outcome in 2015."

931318,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-26 01:28:00,8243,"Chris, the Crown charged him? Not a civil suit? I wonder if the Crown Attorney went to law school? At 60K a year what do you expect? A Lawyer I know says if you can't get a clientele become a Crown or manage a McDonalds. Every time I hire someone to do a roof I ask, "" Are you a Lawyer?"" There are as many Lawyers that graduate from Law School every year then Lawyers practicing law.  I use a capital L for the good Lawyers, there are a few."

931337,ctdd2006,2015-08-26 05:08:00,531,It's a shame but you have to do things with the idea that someone will try to steal from you - I use campgrounds whenever I can because the people owning them keep an eye out as to who is hanging around - when I leave my boat at a dock or shore I always chain it to something - put a cover on it and make sure nothing of value can be seen - put a motion detector under the cover that will sound off if the cover is removed -  I don't fish remote lakes and leave a vehicle parked at such locations - if I did I would disable the truck so that it can't be started - easy enough to do - don't have anything of value in the truck - you could even leave the doors unlocked -  Finally - if I caught someone trying to steal something from me - we both would have to go to the hospital - to get my boot out of his butt - I would clobber the guy and claim that he attacked me and I have to defend myself - Sad way to live....though.  Shouldn't have to and I refuse to.

931367,JoePa,2015-08-26 14:34:00,179,Boy things are a lot different down here - we have what they call the castle doctrine - if someone breaks into your home you can assume that the person means harm and you can shoot him - the point is that you don't know what the crook has in mind when he breaks in - if his intent is to harm you then you may find out after it is too late if you don't act first - especially at night when it is dark in the house - I'll tell you one thing - the instances of break-ins have gone down considerably because of this doctrine - we also have what they call - stand your ground - if someone attacks you - you don't have to run away - you can defend yourself with a gun if needed -  One other point - you never pull out a gun unless you are willing to use it - I have a permit to carry a concealed weapon and do carry when I go fishing and certain places - I often go fishing at night and to places where I may be the only one in the parking area - but I'll tell you something - I feel safe -

931403,aplumma,2015-08-26 19:50:00,6896,The beauty of having the right to bear arms is that people think twice before breaking and entering or public assault. I have my property posted so if you are not invited then you are breaking the law. This is a legal move to help in court if you have to take action. When average citizens are armed and the  guys don't know who is or who isn't that is a strong deterrent to opportunistic crimes . If it is premeditated bad guys will already have the notion that they will do what is needed to get what is yours. personally I have no problems using a gun inside of the law it is just like a hammer it has it's uses just like any tool. The issue I have with knuckle dusting an idiot is they can come back on you anytime they choose in the future when you are not prepared for them if they know you are armed that second visit will not happen.

931216,Headhunter,2015-08-25 14:23:00,5703,"My former boss had a cottage in the Kawartha's. They would have multiple break ins every summer. The local OPP described the criminals as ""Ma and Pa doing their shopping"". They would steal food from their fridge/freezer and any appliance they felt they needed at home. They installed a security system, think ""Alarm Force"" which only slightly reduced their break ins. It also required them to go to the cottage every time the alarm went off - 2 1/2 hour drive. They eventually just sold the cottage as it was just too much stress to own. The cops told them that they were lucky, because they had run into folks who's cottages were broken into and the thieves used circular saws to cut all the floor joists in the cottage! Yah, there are people like that out there. Sorry for your loss Chris. HH"
931221,JoePa,2015-08-25 14:38:00,179,It's a shame but you have to do things with the idea that someone will try to steal from you - I use campgrounds whenever I can because the people owning them keep an eye out as to who is hanging around - when I leave my boat at a dock or shore I always chain it to something - put a cover on it and make sure nothing of value can be seen - put a motion detector under the cover that will sound off if the cover is removed -  I don't fish remote lakes and leave a vehicle parked at such locations - if I did I would disable the truck so that it can't be started - easy enough to do - don't have anything of value in the truck - you could even leave the doors unlocked -  Finally - if I caught someone trying to steal something from me - we both would have to go to the hospital - to get my boot out of his butt - I would clobber the guy and claim that he attacked me and I have to defend myself -
931226,Mister G,2015-08-25 15:23:00,1429," Nope, not in my books, I'll butt heads every time on this topic. My lake is cool, everybody gets along, there's no complaints, we don't need cops suntanning and writing tickets to the good guys when there's dirt bags stealing our crap from behind our backs, pisses me right off.  Come to a lake on a complaint only basis. In their ""free"" time, catch some real crooks. My wife and I pay huge tax dollars, don't damn me, damn them. It's not the individual cops fault, it's the protocol, Pisses me right off, I agree 100%.......but after reading your description of the vessel, they might have done you a favor.......but again not right."
931227,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 15:26:00,11391,"Maybe fishnautographs can chime in here...  I had an incident where a drunk person broke into my house. He wouldnt leave and was being very creepy to my daughters.  I called opp and they said they would be there soon.  I asked if i can physically remove him as a threat and they said yes, baseball bat, gun, knock him out. Just dont kill him  I was kinda surprised...  So before the cops came he tried to lay on the couch with my then 11 year old daughter.  Ok thats it. I picked him up, carried him outside and dropped him near headfirst off my deck.  When opp arrived i told them and they arrested him and said good job.  Anyhow, outta curiousity, i asked if that applies to all ""properties""  He said absolutely, if your property ie boat, truck, house are being threatened you have everyright to physically defend it"
931228,fishnsled,2015-08-25 15:32:00,3520,"That does suck Chris, been down that road before when the house was broken into.  They got the  holes that did my house, hope the same for you."
931238,Rod Caster,2015-08-25 16:55:00,5784,That sucks Chris. Join the local mafia chapter.
931246,Joey,2015-08-25 18:07:00,9122,"Sorry to hear that Chris, theft sucks for sure"
931254,Steelheadphycho,2015-08-25 18:44:00,470,Now that's an idea........
931255,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 18:49:00,11391,Im not local but myself and oldironmaker might be a good start lol
931257,fishing n autograph,2015-08-25 18:52:00,2540,You have the right to use force that is deemed reasonable to remove someone from your property as necessary. You have to ensure you tell the police you told him to leave. After he refuses the. You can throw him out. Hence the reason it's legal for bouncers to toss you hard out of bars.  Just remember this isn't Texas and you can shoot him. No warning shots either.
931258,fishing n autograph,2015-08-25 18:58:00,2540,"What I suggest for everyone to do is look up crime prevention through environmental design. CPTED is the study of how you can make your home/property, vehicles less of a target.  Your local police service may have a trained officer. I'm not sure about the OPP"
931259,fishing n autograph,2015-08-25 19:02:00,2540, In the case of small town services that have 5 cops on the road at one time and a domestic comes in then you have at least two officers off the road to deal with higher priority calls so it's hard to get to everyone that needs service
931261,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 19:33:00,11391,"K bud thats a little confusing  You can shoot or you cant?  I was told you can, but dont try to kill unless necessary. Shoot to injure if you feel you HAVE TOO.  If you can clarify that id appreciate it.  Opp told me straight up to shoot if i felt necessary.  Now after i bounced the person out and we chatted we talked about property. He said defense of your family and home is also applicapable to properies again, ie your truck, your boat etc  Of course im not advocating juat shooting people lol thats crazy  But am i right, if chris had been near his boat when it was stolen, he had the right to defend his property even if force was needed?"
931264,fishing n autograph,2015-08-25 19:51:00,2540,"Yes he can defend his property  There's a fine line though. If your life isn't in danger don't shoot.  I personally wouldn't shoot someone in my house unless my life was truly in danger. I wouldn't shoot someone who was stealing my boat either, I'd kick his a$$ but I wouldn't shoot him."
931266,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 19:58:00,11391,Gotcha. I hope thats common sense lol.  Thats why i didnt use lethal force or even grab a gun.  Just a painful physical removal
931267,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 19:58:00,11391,"Sorry if im derailing, but this is good info to protect our properties"
931268,fishing n autograph,2015-08-25 20:01:00,2540,"Yup nothing wrong with filling in a guy if you catch him, just use some discretion because there's a fine line between defending your property and assaulting someone. If he gives up stop hitting him lol"
931269,Bitsmith2k,2015-08-25 20:02:00,396,"i'd like to think that i'd smash someone if i caught them ripping me off.. i'd never get to a firearm and ammo in time for it to be of use. realistically, i'm not getting stabbed or shot for anything that i own..  if i walked in on a home invasion and my wife and kids were in trouble, i'm getting stabbed/shot. well maybe not for the wife and the questionable kid, but for the one kid that i know is mine, i would.  a drunk loser in my living room, unarmed, would be fun though."
931271,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 20:29:00,11391,"Its not fun at all.  When it happens its fight or flight, even if the person is drunk you dont know if they are armed or what they are capable of.  That being said, f with my family or property and im coming out swinging(fists, knives guns i dont care( well i do but i wont in that moment)"
931272,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 20:30:00,11391,"You really have to take a deep breath and think logically, if possible"
931280,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-25 21:43:00,8243,"J. Edgar Hoover said it his entire life "" there is no such thing as the Mafia"".  It is definitely a violation of someone when you are a victim of any crime. As far as defending your property? Criminals drunk, stoned or sober generally carry weapons, you want my ""stuff"" here are the keys. You want to harm my family? ""Well officers I disarmed him and used his own handgun to kill him.""  There is no such thing as shoot to injure, it's shoot to kill or don't point a weapon. I think this is the first thing a cop is taught when he is given a handgun.  Now if you want to join a group that have members that are highly trained to defend Canadians join The Canadian Legion."
931107,chris.brock,2015-08-24 23:22:00,4053,"This is going to sound stupid but so be it. I had a dream Saturday night my Jon boat was getting stolen. I have these dreams once in a while. Sunday, I drove to where my boat was stored, and sure enough, it was gone.  My cottage friends and me are sick and tired of loosing crap to theft. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next. Trail camera, try and bait the guy, sit in the bush watching the bait, bring the 12 gauge? This is the 3rd rip off from me in 6 months, I'm pissed.  The cop showed up quick after I reported the theft. I liked the guy. I'm going to say this anyways- the cops are out cruising the lakes, harassing the good people asking if the boat driver has a beer in the boat and if he has a pealess whistle, meanwhile I'm out a grand to replace what I've lost. GET THE REAL DIRT BAGS! Pisses me right off!  10' Tracker Jon, grey plastic seat mounted, crude holes cut in the bench to fix the seat, 2x6 across the gunnels for my downrigger, leaks like a sieve (it's a Tracker)  Moore Falls, near Minden and Norland"
931109,grimsbylander,2015-08-24 23:27:00,3016,Easy to get angry at theft. You stew about it for weeks later fantasizing about showing up at just the right moment. Probably better it doesn't happen that way though. I feel bad for you Chris.
931110,Garnet,2015-08-24 23:28:00,2056,Cops showed up that's amazing.  My Misty River ripped off they sent me to order desk. Well they called it reports desk. Felt like order desk.

931115,FloatnFly,2015-08-24 23:50:00,1640,"That sucks, happening more and more in northern areas  My boss has had 6 boats stolen or destroyed via shot gun in the last 3 years in Temagami, the latest was a 17ft aluminum, someone cut the heavy chain it was locked to to steal it, the others he had a 14ft fibreglass squareback canoe sunk on him, he found in the spring blown apart by the ice that formed in it,  others have had the transom and gunnels blown apart by shot gun cause they were chained and locked.  He has them all on the banks of back lakes up there so he just has to portage his motor in.  Its common for people up there to borrow a boat, but then they return it to where they got it.  Stealing it or destroying it is just plain ignorant"

With out sounding like a D bag, the best advise I can give you is stop making your property easy to steal.  The harder it is to steal the easier it is to keep."

Well you know me I am at about 15-20 different lakes all summer long show a pucture of the boat if you can and I will keep an eye out for it ..... I just noticed too that last week at one of 4 different lakes I fished that someone tried to break into my truck my door handle is broken and some D-bag must have tried to pry open my door at the boat launch as most of the lakes I fish are out of the way spots out vehicles are sitting  ducks while we are out in the boat ....

I would put up a spy point camera that has a remote receiver for the SD card. That way you can tell who did it even if they destroy or take the camera..
