It is called Party Of One by Michael Harris. I have always like Michaels style of investigative journalism and writings.. I must say since I started reading this book it has been really hard to put it down. It is about Stephen Harper and Canadas radical makeover. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is unsure who they are going to vote for in the election. Has anyone on the board read it yet and what are you thoughts if so.
931200,netminder,2015-08-25 12:46:00,514,Is it pro- or anti-Harper?
931217,kickingfrog,2015-08-25 14:26:00,8333,Depends on if it was in the non-fiction or fiction section.
931220,GbayGiant,2015-08-25 14:38:00,1780,Is it pro- or anti-Harper? easy answer...
931567,netminder,2015-08-27 19:39:00,514,Yeah I guess I could have figured that out knowing it was written by a journalist. lol
931577,fish_fishburn,2015-08-27 20:15:00,1311,Im half way through the book and its a real eye opener. Friggen thing is over 500 pages. Harper has destroyed many of his own staff over the last 10 yrs as well.

How did he get away with some much. A war on science was eye opening. Is there a coles notes version haha
