931212,Headhunter,2015-08-25 14:10:00,5703,"Wormdunker, just leave space between the rolls on the stick and the bacon will cook evenly. Also, we used half a bacon strip for each roll, which also helps to cook the bacon evenly. But as I mentioned earlier in the thread, coating the fish with fish crisp, then wrapping in bacon was a great combination. Wayne, it's always time! HH"

931511,Leecher,2015-08-27 13:21:00,7832,Great report and pics Will!!!  Looks like a walleye factory up there!  Did you guys bring any back for the freezer?
931515,Headhunter,2015-08-27 13:32:00,5703,"We did bring some back to be delivered to the fellow who had to cancel at the last minute due to family obligations. We felt that since he could'nt come, he'd surely like to at least enjoy a meal, after losing his deposit. HH"

930767,fishnsled,2015-08-22 16:17:00,3520,"The planning started back in January as to where to go and who would be on this trip.  The obvious call as to where to go was Mike Borger of course and once again he did not disappoint.  He had a few suggestions that were within everyone’s budget.  After some discussion, Jembi Lake with White River Air was the destination. The months past quick and the next thing you know we are days away from the trip.  Due to some unfortunate family concerns, one of our guys had to cancel.  It was tough to find anyone that last minute with most having their vacation plans in place.  So Joe, Ken and I made the trek to Jembi Lake, AKA – A Walleye Factory. We were fortunate to get in a day earlier and that all of our schedules would allow us to do so.  A late departure got us to the Soo by midnight with an overnight stay there that gave us a fresh start for the last leg of the trip.  Up and on the road after a quick bite got us to the base camp, loaded the plane and sitting at our home for the next few days by noon.    Our chariot for the trip up at the air base              Joe was just a little excited I think....                   https://youtu.be/YLzSKik9Q8w  Jembi Lake         The winds were pretty crazy the day.  We figured they were likely pushing 40-50k gusts and had waves that were 2 to 3 footers crashing on our shoreline. We unpacked and got the rods and tackle ready, stood there pondering how the heck we were going to get the boats in the water without sinking them.  And if we didn’t, would we really want to be out in that washing machine of a lake?   We had some lunch and decided just to wait it out for a bit and fish from shore.  Well that windblown shoreline was a hot spot.  The pike and walleye were quite willing to grab our baits.  Before you know it we have our first fish fry for dinner and never even started a boat.         The dinner was excellent and the winds died down enough to get the boats in and head out for a few hours.  The fish were still cooperative as we came to the end of the first day.         The next day, Alarm Clock Joe had us up bright and early.        With the coffee brewing we grabbed a few shots of the much more favourable conditions.  I wish I had my camera when I went down to the dock to throw a cast as there was a moose in the next bay.  As always, it was very cool to see.         With coffee in hand we made our way down the lake trolling to explore these new to us waters.  Once again it didn’t take long and the fish were chomping at are baits.                    I always enjoy exploring a new lake and figuring out the hot spots.  On Jembi Lake, it was made pretty easy as the fish just seemed to be everywhere.  There were areas that did produce better than others but overall you could not go wrong anywhere you dropped a line.  There was a good average size of 18 inchers but great numbers of 20 inch plus fish were caught by all of us.  I could ramble on more but I might as well let the pictures do the talking. Every day was the same with eat, sleep and fish being the only objectives.                             "
930768,fishnsled,2015-08-22 16:17:00,3520,"Part 2    Countless numbers of doubleheaders                Nice stringer of fish for our next meal.         Another beautiful sunrise.                                         The hunchback of Jembi Lake?     This is always a great treat      We got all the food groups but chicken, not bad!  lol.         As for the accommodations, they suited us fine.  It is call a 6 man cabin but we felt with 4 it would be tight but manageable.                 Stove and wood stove worked fine.       Generator was nice for the lighting in the evening and worked like a charm. There was also an outlet if you had to charge up your batteries for the next day.       The boats and motors were great, no issues there.    Our fly out morning was slightly delayed by a bit of fog.                      The fog did clear quite quickly which was nice.     The future of the lake.  We did catch quite a few pike but nothing really photo worthy.  I'd have to say it is not really a pike lake and weird how all the ones we got were so skinny with such a great forge base.     Lots of these guys swimming around.     Our ticket out.             https://youtu.be/vw6GJR5Iwug  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vw6GJR5Iwug"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Overall a fantastic trip with a great group of guys and great fishing!!

931023,Headhunter,2015-08-24 14:04:00,5703,"Thanks for doing up the report in a ""timely"" manner Will! LOL It was a fun trip to say the least. As it was my first time flying in, it certainly opened my eyes as to what a difference it makes hitting a lake that doesn't get fishing pressure. It changed for me anyway, from a fishing trip, to a catching trip! When we first arrived at camp, as Will mentioned, the wind came up huge, forcing us to stay on shore. I grabbed a beer and took a seat on the rock, while Will casted to the adjacent weed bed. His second cast, a pike of about 6 inches followed his lure in, then proceeded to wiggle it's way outta the water and up the rock, chasing FishnSleds lure. About a foot up the rock, it turned and headed back to the water. I looked at Will and said that it looks like their hungry! Dinner that night came from shore in a couple of hours of casting. That to me was just really fun. A huge thanks to both Will and Ken, for the invite, great guys and entertaining conversation  without a doubt. And many thanks for helping this newbie out in the planning of the trip as well. If it's pickereyes you want to catch, well, Jembi sure has them in spades... I figured in a rough estimate, that the three of us consumed somewhere in the area of 18lbs of fillets in the five days we were there, as evidenced in the pics above. HH  PS.... we marinated some fillets in Frank's Hot sauce for two days in the fridge. (Yes, we were mindful of our possession limits) A quick coating in fish crisp, then, wrapped in bacon on the BBQ was the meal highlight for me anyway. Just a wonderful meal, that I could enjoy every day if I could!"
