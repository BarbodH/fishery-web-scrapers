929070,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-12 00:20:00,10439,"Was on my local trader site earlier today and came across a prop that should work well on my rig. Brand new Mercury High Five stainless prop (painted finish). 12 3/4"" 20P for 75-125HP outboards.     It's going to need a paint job. can't be having a  blue prop on my nice black engine.  Oh yeah, the price?  $140!!!!"
929077,2 tone z71,2015-08-12 00:45:00,1311,Ya pretty sweet deal for a oem merc prop
929088,captpierre,2015-08-12 01:52:00,2521,About the same price as a gallon of milk up there
929112,misfish,2015-08-12 10:58:00,29133,Nice snag. I like the blue. It matches your eyes.
929134,Lape0019,2015-08-12 12:45:00,647,"I'd say you came out on top! Never knew they painted stainless props but I would just leave it as is and run it. If it needs some work, maybe I would have the paint stripped but I wouldn't go painting it black."
929382,davey buoy,2015-08-13 19:18:00,5505,"I wouldn't paint it either Dave,it will fade. Wonder if they make that for a I/O mercriuser motor/outdrive  ?"
929390,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-13 19:41:00,10439,"I wouldn't paint it either Dave,it will fade. Wonder if they make that for a I/O mercriuser motor/outdrive  ?  I guess I could remove the paint and polish the prop if it performs properly on my boat. A shiny prop would be pretty!!!"
929513,DOS,2015-08-14 17:14:00,119,"Just run your prop up into the sand, it will polish the prop in no time.  And you will probably get a whole new motor out of the deal...."
929823,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-17 02:21:00,10439,"Got out with the new prop and it seems to work pretty good!! Need to mess around with the vent plugs to try and get the hole shot better but I can run it trimmed up higher and with the jack plate raised 3 1/2"" without cavitation. In shallow water when docking or maneuvering I can lift the jack plate all the way and trim higher than before and have better control."
929839,Roy,2015-08-17 09:00:00,13728,A painted SS prop is less likely to be stolen. I imagine that stripping the paint and polishing a SS prop would be more expensive and time consuming than buying a polished SS prop.

929879,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-17 15:28:00,10439,Well after running it this weekend the paint's already peeling. I'll strip it in the winter and polish 'er up.
930794,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-22 20:31:00,10439,Too windy to head to the lake today so I decided to strip the paint off the new prop. It wasn't hard at all and took about 1 1/2 hours from start to finish.  
930807,davey buoy,2015-08-22 23:12:00,5505,Looks so much nicer cleaned up.You better take that off after every outing.I can see that going missing.
930813,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-23 00:30:00,10439,"If I felt like theft was an issue I could always throw one of these on.    Where I live in town, theft is not much of an issue. All the drunks and crack heads all all the way over on the other side of town. They are too lazy to come all the way out here. My boat stays indoors when it's not going  to or from or on the lake."
930956,2 tone z71,2015-08-24 00:39:00,1311,That looks sik nice job...what did you use to strip it
930982,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-24 03:25:00,10439,"That looks sik nice job...what did you use to strip it  Just some contractor strength paint stripper. The paint came off very easily. I was quite surprised.  The name is  Heirloom Max heavy duty paint stripper. Got it @ CT, but I don't see it on their website for some reason.  "
