931349,jtracc,2015-08-26 11:41:00,97,That's interesting... Nice vid thx.  I did like those yeti coolers but never liked the price.
931356,wormdunker,2015-08-26 12:45:00,1711,Thanx for the info.  Very interesting.
931380,Lunkerhunter,2015-08-26 16:33:00,455,interesting that the coleman one seemed to have more ice than the yeti after 8 days. would never have guessed that.
931382,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-26 16:56:00,10439,I use a Coleman Marine Extreme cooler and it does hold ice for a long time. Surprised the Yeti was no better.
931383,Fisherman,2015-08-26 17:02:00,7201,"The Coleman Extreme are my choice, definitely cheaper and do hold ice a long time.  Had a small block of dry ice in one that lasted over a week."
931405,davey buoy,2015-08-26 20:47:00,5505,"Coleman has been around for how long?.No surprise here ,I find Coleman products to be built well.My lantern and stove are close to 40 years old and still work like the first day I bought them."
931450,grimsbylander,2015-08-27 01:12:00,3016,"What surprised me was seeing 28-30 lbs. EMPTY. Geesh, pack them full of ice, beer and fish ( in that order) and they'd be a ball buster to lift."
931483,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-27 04:10:00,10439,"FYI If anyone is looking for a good deal, Canadian Tire has the Igloo Marine Ultra Cooler 95qt on sale (40% off) starting Friday.  http://flyer.canadiantire.ca/Canadiantire/WeeklyAd?storeid=2400516#!/store/2400516/sneakpeek/y  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/sports-rec/camping/coolers/hard-coolers/igloo-marine-ultra-cooler-100-qt-0853475p.html#.Vd6NFvlVjUc"
931487,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-27 07:28:00,8243,That was surprising. The Yeti is even smaller than the Coleman I think. It's like a 700 buck Taylor Made or Nike driver being better than one for 300. The most expensive has to be better and consumers will believe that. I choose the Coleman.
931636,Mister G,2015-08-27 23:31:00,1429,"I think for the price of a Yete ""cooler"" you can get a small generator and a 5 cubic freezer or small frig."
931640,Fisherman,2015-08-28 00:02:00,7201,"I think for the price of a Yete ""cooler"" you can get a small generator and a 5 cubic freezer or small frig. Yup, picked up a 3cu fridge/freezette for $65 brand new."
931644,Ben_Daniels,2015-08-28 00:54:00,435,But the YETI's are bear / 500 lb man proof...      LOL ?
931647,Fisherman,2015-08-28 01:21:00,7201,But I think probably 90% or more of us don't go camping in bear country or give Bubba the chance to go nuts on our coolers.
931648,Ben_Daniels,2015-08-28 01:28:00,435,"Yea, that's what I was sarcastically getting at. Not too bad on their part marketing wise though I'd say"
931658,Tim Mills,2015-08-28 02:27:00,476,The Yeti commercials are great. my Coleman does well with block ice.
931662,manitoubass2,2015-08-28 02:55:00,11391,Colemans for me  Block ice is where its at
931666,PUMP KNOWS,2015-08-28 03:11:00,937,So expensive for a cooler
931677,Mister G,2015-08-28 09:47:00,1429,I say let the bears buy their own cooler if they want a Yeti.....
931693,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-28 14:57:00,10439,Colemans for me  Block ice is where its at  I use a 10L spring water jug from the grocery store as an ice block. I refill them with about 8L of tap water and throw in the freezer after I have finished the drinking the spring water. It's just like a giant freezer pack in the cooler and doesn't fill it with water. I only buy cubes so I have some to drop in me rum!!!
931694,BillM,2015-08-28 15:02:00,17367,I haven't found anything better then a home made box with 4in of styrofoam insulation..  Blocks of ice last over a week with ease.  Key is to not keep opening it.
931698,manitoubass2,2015-08-28 15:35:00,11391,Ive done the same bill but usually a lil smaller bottle.  I use frozen bottles at work too to keep things cold.  Cheap and effective and reusable
931728,tb4me,2015-08-28 19:04:00,3295,With the cost of these bad boys I could just buy me a boat and a truck to pull it with..lol See how many get that
931732,Mister G,2015-08-28 19:09:00,1429,"Yesterday I took 3/4"" of Styrofoam and used that silver tape that you have to peel off the backing to secure it to my small 26 qt Igloo cooler cover that is tied down on the back of my boat. I use that to keep worms, drinks and food cold. I put in 3 frozen square qt containers laid on the bottom. Today and when I got home they were still 7/8 frozen. Not bad for 9 hours.....before that they would be less then 50% frozen, mostly water.  I paid only $20 for this Igloo marine cooler but was not happy with the very thin non-insulated cover. Now I very happy with it's performance."
