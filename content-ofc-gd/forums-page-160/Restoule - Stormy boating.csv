Recently did Massasauga and it is littered with hidden rocks and shoals, so I treaded very lightly.  Anyone have any experience navigating those waters? How's the channel from stormy to clear? I'm told it's very narrow but unsure of depth / rocks.  Cheers"

931413,musky666,2015-08-26 21:42:00,126,I have found two submerged rocks on Woods Bay/Blackstone- the hard way! Trolling speed only though so no damage. Heading up in the morning and will be very careful with the new boat.
931434,theduster23,2015-08-26 23:47:00,11,You mean in Massasauga? Shoals and rocks everywhere.  Hopefully Stormy is less eventful.
