930389,Sinker,2015-08-19 23:59:00,8692,"I have great landlords too, but its a two way street. I take care of the place like I own it, add things to make it better, keep the place up etc...... thats just how I am.....but there are a lot of shady people out there.  The house I am in right now was desyroyed by the previous tenants. The landlord lives in AB, and trusted the tenants, but got royally screwed over! Im talking thousands to make the place liveable.  When I first came to see the house it was disgusting!!!! Trash everywhere. Inside, outside....everywhere. I told her the place wasnt even liveable and she didnt belive me! When I took pics and sent them to her I realized what was going on, and felt so bad for her that we took the place and cleaned it all up, made the property nice again, and shr hasnt said no to anything we've needed.  Its a great place now, I love it, but its been a lot of work for us.  My gf is a property manager, and the horror stories she has would blow your mind!  I guess you just have to really be careful what tenants you pick.  S."
930391,manitoubass2,2015-08-20 00:11:00,11391,"Sinker i hear ya! Ive upgraded this house and the landlord loves it, not only in the house but yard and lanscape as well.  My mom worked as a property manager in grande prairie and she too has horrific stories.  Ive been on the other end as well. I had an apartment in edmonton for work, it was expensive but nice. I also rented a house in fort frances for my family while i was at work.  I was gone on a long stretch( about 6-8 months). Came home early to surprise my family.  Well it was me that was surprised. My ex had turned hard into drugs. The house was unreal(basically a crack house)  The landlord had it accessed at at least 30 large in damages. Boy he was not happy.  That was the end of us lol  The landlord wanted to sue me because he knew i had money. But i helped clean and renovate the house and he ended up being very grateful and a good friend to this day.  Wise words, be VERY careful who you rent to"

In my opinion there is something amiss if an individual has great credit and doesn't buy their own property in these times of low interest rates. There is always the exception like a recent divorce and business failure. I always liked renting to people that previously owned their own home but no longer did for many reasons, they took care as if were their own.  Find a place you can rent a portion of it to pay for your mortgage. Absentee landlord especially out of town for your first property? like I said before and many here have,  never."

I have 3-4 people at any given time and have had 3 long term guys in my age range (25) for the past 3 years and can assume that two of them will be in there probably after I buy my next house lol,  I would suggest buying a place you can rent out the basement or main floor and live in the other half so they are mindful that you could show up at any given point"
930516,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-20 20:09:00,8243,"You are well on your way Lucas. I don't care where that property is that you own in Hamilton what I do know is that your investment has seen a 30% increase, or more, in the last 24 months. I used to work with many men at the plant that were building McMansions on a Steelwokers shift wages when people were loosing there homes with interest rates at 18%. They were in their 30' and 40's when I was in my 20's when I watched them do this. All those that made a comfortable enough life to buy their children their own homes as wedding gifts was enough for me to start owning and renting when I was 24. I learned a long time ago real estate was the way to go for a working guy like me and others especially when I lost 50K in the stock market in 81'. I retired from the plant at 45 when I sold all 3 places. Then bought 2 places in Florida for peanuts and 1 in Arizona when the real estate in the US went for a poop.  My wife is too young to retire and doesn't even want to think about hanging around with the likes of me all day but when she does we will choose from the 2 places we have down south that I still rent out today. I can afford to flip 35 and 45% to the property management companies there as all I need to do is deposit my cheques at the end of the month and watch the equity go up.  Keep it up."

930595,woodenboater,2015-08-21 01:34:00,2277,what can happen if you rent to people who have bad intent on the mind. enough to put that idea to rest huh lol  http://www.torontolife.com/informer/features/2015/08/20/jesse-gubb-the-tenant-from-hell/  and  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/nightmare-rental-a-cautionary-tale-for-short-term-stays/article26033529/
930627,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-21 06:40:00,8243,"Some very scary reading there woodenboater. I think all of us current and former landlords all have our bad or even horror stories but having said that all of these stories should not dissuade any future individual from trying the property management route. It can be very rewarding when done right and lucrative. These experiences should help anyone considering it like Pete to go into this venture prepared and educated. One thing I have learned that is if you rent out a slum you will get the same clients that some of these landlords dread. They always don't start out as a slum but can be after a bad tenant, fast. Without backup resources or personal skills repairs aren't sometimes doable and the property suffers.  The biggest thing for a prospective landlord must have is a great customer relations personality or basically being able to work with people in a calm professional manner. Be able to get along with people without being a pushover nor have a personality that can be confrontational at all. Those are 2 things in ones personality that anyone renting property to strangers, or even friends can have at all. I had a pal who's cousin and his own daughter do a ""midnight move"" on him, of course they were behind in rent a few months when they booked on him and the rent. That was very tough on him, his own daughter. He unfortunately passed away on us this past winter and I know the stress of this property he had contributed to his poor health. He is the last person I would consider a people person and he did it after telling him my opinion and telling him of the situations I have had over the past 30 years."

930773,ch312,2015-08-22 18:09:00,1590,"One needs to accept the fact that nothing in life is perfect and almost everyone goes through a rough time at one point or another. That said, I know three people quite well who own rental units and are doing quite well. From what I gather being a landlord is just like running a business or holding a supervisor position. Some people can do it and excel while others don't stand a chance and will be eaten alive.  I work with a ""professional renter"", who just won a monthly $300 decrease in rent in court against a slumlord, and his #1 advice is to have the place up to date and follow the rules as there is no better way to encourage tenants to screw you over than being a deadbeat slumlord who owns infested and unsafe buildings. A tenant should not have to call a landlord more than once about issues with the building. They call, you or someone else fixes the problem quickly. Zero excuses. It's the landlords who put off repairs or updates that will have the majority of problems.    I'll be renting out my mortgage free home for $1500 monthly after we move into our new place and am really looking forward to letting tenants pay our bills....and maybe the odd vacation   "
931033,mattybculp,2015-08-24 15:25:00,388,"Well I own a piece of property that has one commercial unit and three residential apartments. Is it all peaches and cream? of course not. Is it a lot of work ? yes. But I don't know of many other investments where I can make the returns I will from this property in a 5 year turn around. I have had welfare tenants ODSP tenants and financially stable tenants. The most important thing I have gained in my five year experience is to really feel good about who, your renting too. Are you going to be 100% right all of the time? No. But the last 3-4 tenants I have had, have been great tenants, If there on welfare or ODSP, the cheque comes directly to me. There are great tenants out there who are on social assistance. I make sure that with all the rent there is more than enough funds to carry the mortgage and taxes, that way if an emergency happens, the appropriate trade is contacted an rectified quickly, at the end of the year if there is a surplus of funds, due to no ""disasters"" I put that money back into the building to increase the value of the property and avoid taxes needing to be paid on it. Its to the point now where, I give one of my tenants $50 off a month just to be my eyes and ears around the place and it has been worth every penny. I personally would not own a property 3-4 hours away, and I'm lucky as after my move to my new home im 2 mins away from my rental property, I don't even have to go there to collect rent they drop it off to me. Every month the mortgage is paid I just think of the money going into my pocket, I was planning on getting out after five years and cashing in but im thinking I may hold on to it for a little while longer yet. Lastly know your rights, and know the tenants rights , have a professional lease/rent agreement prepared and find a good tenant. Just saying for me renting has been a really positive experience. Perhaps the next home I buy I will be able to be mortgage free, all on the back of a rental home"

Cons?  I would be about 4 hrs drive away from the property."

930194,cheaptackle,2015-08-18 23:43:00,849,"This is taking a while for me to type - only got one hand I can use right now and I'm spending extra time correcting to make sure to be clear... Speaking as a former administrator for a major landlord I can honestly say that IF you have a LARGE warchest (read $$$) to cover repairs, maintenance, legal and other expenses along with suffering not being able to collect large sums of unpaid rent and can stomach the grief professional tenants (ya they exist) can give you then by all means go for it.  I'm sure you recognize this as planning for the worst and hoping for the best - because IF you get good responsible tenants (ya they do exist) it can be rewarding as well. Never invest more than you are prepared to lose, if you get a mortgage to buy a rental depending on the rent to cover all the costs and maybe a dollar or two extra, consider what would happen in a worst case scenario of a bad tenant and your ability to survive the very high costs and lost income that occur when the worst happens.  It can take months to just get a ruling in your favour, with more time after that for the tenants to be evicted legally by the sheriff, then repairs etc while no money is coming in, and a huge outstanding unpaid rental account to try and collect, again with associated costs.  Meanwhile the bank/mortgagee, utilities and taxes all wanna be paid regardless of what you might have coming in. Suggest you might wanna review some case histories on CANLII and/or the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Board sites before you spend dollar number one.  Might even wanna google for professional tenants and see what horror stories are out there. Sorry to be such a downer but I've spent enough time in the past appearing before the various boards, tribunals and small claims courts to have been on a first name basis with many of the members and judges.  Every single item I've outlined I've had hands on experience with.  Probably why I ain't doing it now - took a toll on me!  Michael"

In the end, as long as there is a roof over our heads,food to survive, and I do my best to keep my family happy, I feel I should be fine without ever having to own a house.  In the end, the children probably hardly ever live in the same place their parents worked hard to make their home.

930348,Big Cliff,2015-08-19 20:33:00,6899,"I am so surpeised at all the negitive comments, I guess it's good to know what can go bad but there is also lots of good tennents out there. Sinker, I know you, I'd rent to you any time because you'd take care of it like it was your own. There are many like you, we rented for a few years until we got our feet under us, never missed a rent payment, left any place we rented as good as or better than when we moved in.  We have rented our basement to students for a number of years now and I can tell you with all honesty they have all become super friends and we have never been stiffed for a penny! Mind you, we do live upstairs so it's a little different than what you are talking about.  One thing I did learn from a friend is if you rent to someone that is on welfare or something like that, have the rent cheques sent directly to you. That way you can be sure you will always get paid, if they get the money and don't give it to you then you could be stuck and you end up having to go through the system.  Just do your homework before you hand someone the keys, do they have a history, do they have a job, do they both work, check referances carefully!  Renting out a property can be an excellent way to build for your retirement but like any investment there can be some risk but there can also be some fantastic rewards."

And have now started renting.  My long term goal (5 years) is to buy a house that has a basement apartment and rent that out.  That's what I did back when I bought my first house.  And I didn't have any major issues with my tenant(s).  Helped pay my mortgage, and save money to by my dream home in the country (which I no longer own...)  On top of that, one of my tentant was a general contractor, and he fixed the place up nice for me, actually increased the value of my home a little bit.  I would shy away from buying a rental property 4 hours away.  It could turn out to be an absolute nightmare!  Even if you get good tenants, there could be big issues with the house, and you may have to drive back and forth several times a week!
