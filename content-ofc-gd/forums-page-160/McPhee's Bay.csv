Headed there for Labour Day weekend  Hopefully get my soon to be 3y/o daughter hooked!"

931489,fishindevil,2015-08-27 08:20:00,6254,Worm harnesses and bottom bouncers will catch walleyes anywhere you use them !!! North south east or west !!! And the best part is bass pike & muskies even lake trout love them too !!!! Def take a few with you 1oz to 2oz bouncers & braid will cover you too about 30-35ft no problem ....
