931576,mike rousseau,2015-08-27 20:14:00,4661,"So...  YAMAHA is replacing the entire power head at zero cost to me.... So I basically am getting a new ""engine"" in my outboard...  I'm AMAZED and really pleased with my treatment from both Yamaha and Clayton marine....  Ive never had the motor serviced by a dealer... Did my own oil changes... Did not perform any real preventative maintenance other then oil and grease... Used aftermarket oil filters... And had 1150 hours on the motor and they covered my rear end on this one...  And they're fast IMO... I'll have it next week wich is under 3 weeks turnaround...  I'm so happy with this outcome I might hug the maintenance manager... Lol  1150 HOURS IN 3 YEARS... Bananas!!! I think he said 700-800 were under 1000rpm tho..."
931579,Fisherman,2015-08-27 20:23:00,7201,"Excellent outcome for sure, happy customer."
931596,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-27 20:51:00,10439,Good to hear.
931598,misfish,2015-08-27 20:53:00,29133,Awesome
931601,davey buoy,2015-08-27 21:03:00,5505,That speaks words about your dealer going the extra mile Mike .Glad it worked out so well.
931606,Steve,2015-08-27 21:35:00,2075,great to hear.  This should silence some of the naysayers who say you don't get the service when buying from the states....great stuff!!!
931609,fishindevil,2015-08-27 21:53:00,6254,yamaha and your dealer rock !!!!
931659,2 tone z71,2015-08-28 02:35:00,1311,Awesome awesome ...good for another few thousand hrs
931670,Walleye72,2015-08-28 03:46:00,156,I would never have believed that this level of service would be possible in today's day and age.  Thanks for the update and so glad it worked out for you.  1150 hours.  Are you sure that thing isn't off the house boat you live on?
929523,misfish,2015-08-14 17:58:00,29133,Just tell the boss you got to go. Then call work and tell them the same thing. LOL
929525,mike rousseau,2015-08-14 18:09:00,4661,Lol I had to call my boss cause I was stuck out on the river and didn't know if I'd get to work on time  He was trying to help me troubleshoot... Lol
930238,mike rousseau,2015-08-19 05:01:00,4661,"So update on my issue...  Maintenance manager had no issue putting it as warranty work...  Dropped the boat Saturday.... No tech till Monday...  I called today to find out I had a mojor issue in the power head... They found ""chunks of metal"" in my oil strainer (i think that's what he called it)  Guy said the time it would take to tear apart the power head to find the problem he would rather just replace everything... Cause in the end that would likely be the outcome anyways after the metal chunks have gone through the engine...  He said he wants to replace the entire power head for me under warranty but had to clear it with Yamaha because marinas are only permitted to do up to $2000 in repairs before they need to get clearance...  I should know for sure what's happening by the end of the week...  He said if he gets the green light my motor should be ready next weekend...  So far I'm very happy with how I've been treated...  I'll update as soon as I'm 100% sure the outcome"
930240,cram,2015-08-19 05:20:00,1733,That's pretty fantastic treatment!
930295,Fisherpete,2015-08-19 14:40:00,1814,Hope it gets worked out soon Mike! Nothing worse than being boatless...
930297,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-19 14:57:00,10439,Great news that they are looking after you!!! Bad news that it was a major issue.
930301,mike rousseau,2015-08-19 15:24:00,4661,I have some great friends and family that have all offered their boats up to me...  Even a buddy I've never fished with offered up his 20' Larson tiller with 200 hp Merc for a tournament this weekend...  Felt pretty good to see friends offer to help like that
930310,misfish,2015-08-19 16:31:00,29133,You can borrow my toon Mike.
930315,Walleye72,2015-08-19 16:48:00,156,This complete motor failure is the stuff of my nightmares.   So glad that you have warranty coverage.  Is this kind of thing common in motors that are relatively new?  I don't hear of people blowing their engine on a 5 year old car all that often.  Is it because outboards are run at WOT for much of their life in some cases?
930317,Mister G,2015-08-19 16:55:00,1429,This complete motor failure is the stuff of my nightmares.   So glad that you have warranty coverage.

930326,mike rousseau,2015-08-19 17:39:00,4661,The way it was explained was that it could be a $50 part but the labour cost involved to completely strip down the power head... Fix the problem... As well as any other damages caused by the broken parts going through my engine.. And put everything back together... Is more costly then replacing the power head...   also consider according to the industry standard of 100hrs per year... I'm probably over 10 years of use on my motor... I figure I broke 1000 hours... I'm actually curious to see how many hours I put on that motor in 3 years... If I go out for 8 hours my motor runs for 8 hours...
930329,jimmer,2015-08-19 18:22:00,2730,I heard that the motors they build now are just not expected to get the same number of hours that the old ones used to get. Most of the old ones would last forever if cared for properly.
930332,dave524,2015-08-19 18:34:00,4508,"I heard that the motors they build now are just not expected to get the same number of hours that the old ones used to get. Most of the old ones would last forever if cared for properly.  Think the downward spiral all started when they made the switch from premix to oil injection.  Bet half the early oil injection motors , the owners disabled it and went back to premixing."
930336,captpierre,2015-08-19 19:06:00,2521,"I've been told- maybe on this forum, that typical North American outboard power heads will last 1000 hrs before major work Japanese more like 5000. True or false?"
930339,Sinker,2015-08-19 19:38:00,8692,"I have a japanese made yamaha built mariner engine. I would bet my paycheck there is a million hours on it. No kidding. I'm like mike, I do a lot of trolling, and rack up the hours.  I've had to replace a head gasket in the 20 years I've had it. Did the impeller once a few years ago.  Right now I have no reverse gear, but that's a whole different issue. The power head had been bullet proof!  Pre mix, 2 strokes are hard to kill.  S."
930357,BillM,2015-08-19 21:08:00,17367,"Shane, 1 million hours = 114 years  That thing is a relic! lol"
930361,2 tone z71,2015-08-19 21:40:00,1311,Mike ..glad there replacing your power head ..crap happens ..even to yammies
930363,Mister G,2015-08-19 22:00:00,1429," I only got 30 years from my Johnson VRO outboard, but I'm happy with that."
930381,KraTToR,2015-08-19 23:01:00,506,"If any of you guys come from a manufacturing background you'll understand that building an outboard motor (or anything for that matter!) that will last 20+ years is a bad business model.  Back in the days when they didn't have the knowledge or OPEX certain manufactures ""overbuilt"" their equipment in an effort to gain market share through customer loyalty.  In today's world where statistics is a science and engineering can predict, with amazing accuracy, just how long a product will last.  Many cynics will say that most things last  ""just after the warranty expires"" which isn't far from the truth.  Its a fine line between keeping customers happy and keeping the business profitable.  A proverbial tight rope really.  Its my belief that if you've had brand xx model yy for 30 years and its been flawless, be happy.  With today's technology this is the last thing any of the manufacturers want..  Its also not a reason to by another product from this same manufacturer either.  Unless of course you can get the exact same model, built during that time.  Regardless, its nice to see that Yamaha is covering the cost and that Mike's getting excellent service.  All of this stuff we use and play with is man made so I take that for what its worth.  At the end of the day, how problems are taken care of is really what matters."
930390,Sinker,2015-08-20 00:02:00,8692,"Ok, that was a little over exaggerated, but it has a ton of hours on it!!! LOL  S."
930397,captpierre,2015-08-20 00:43:00,2521,"Never could understand why the ""clock"" on outboards don't consider RPMs. A big difference between trolling and 4-6000 RPMs on a used motor."
930400,2 tone z71,2015-08-20 01:02:00,1311,The computers will break it all down...total hrs..% of hrs at this rpm that rpm ..overrevs etc
930416,mike rousseau,2015-08-20 05:18:00,4661,Yup  He said they pull the last 30 minutes run time anyway...
930430,porkpie,2015-08-20 12:03:00,2521,Great outcome!!  Glad to hear it!
930433,Beavertail,2015-08-20 12:30:00,331,"Couldn't ask for a better outcome, glad to hear."
929358,mike rousseau,2015-08-13 17:45:00,4661,Hello  Had to get towed in today...  So... I was driving WOT smooth as can be then it seamed like my motor slowed down ever so slightly... Like 2-3 mph difference...  Shortly after I began to hear a knocking/clacking sound and an alarm went off...  I shut it down and called for a tow to avoid further damage...  The knocking/clacking sound seams to follow the RPMS as far as frequency goes...  The noise occurs in all 3 gears  I ran it on the muffs and removed 1 spark plug at a time and the noise remained constant...  I can't tell where it's coming from because it's resignating  through the entire motor.... With the hood on it sounds like the lower end... With the hood off its louder so then it sounds like the engine...  A little reasearch says it could be a piston rod... Pop shaft bearing... As well as others...  My warranty expired yesterday....  Any input or expert advise would be very much appreciated....  2012 f50t Yamaha tiller 50hp 4 stroke  Thanks  Mike
929361,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-13 17:49:00,10439,Get it into your dealer ASAP and they will probably fix it under warranty since it only just expired!!!
929365,mike rousseau,2015-08-13 18:05:00,4661,Already called... My dealer is a few hours away in NY State tho... Want to make sure it's not minor before towing across the boarder   Video is coming
929372,mike rousseau,2015-08-13 18:19:00,4661,https://www.facebook.com/mike.rousseau.148/videos/10153568382081057/  Having problems posting the video... It's on my Facebook page tho  I'll put it through YouTube tonight
929373,DanD,2015-08-13 18:26:00,2223,"Wouldn't a Canadian dealer honor the warranty? I know in automotive a new car's warranty is honored cross board. International companies, GM for example will honor their vehicles anywhere in the world that that model is sold.  Dan."
929375,porkpie,2015-08-13 18:39:00,2521,"Get to dealer ASAP.  If warranty just expired yesterday, you'd be foolish not to.  Knocking and clanging are never good, and in this instance wether it's major or minor, the sooner you can get in the dealers door the better just in case It's a major failure.  You've got a better than average chance of coverage if the warranty just expired and you take steps immediately."
929380,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-13 19:07:00,10439,Could be something as simple as a bad sensor or something as big as a piston or bearing issue.
929391,esoxansteel,2015-08-13 20:06:00,1307,"Get to a yammi dealer, ASAP"
929400,Garnet,2015-08-13 21:23:00,2056,"Could be a lot of things, not likely minor.  Did you check the lower unit oil for chunks, and did the plugs have any metal on them.  Yamaha doesn't have a cross border agreement it's at there discretion. That and bad parts supply keep lots from buying."
929402,misfish,2015-08-13 21:32:00,29133," I hope I dont read a post that reads   Warranty expired one day and no, they would not cover.  Although it,s not my outboard, I WILL  BE PISSED."
929404,2 tone z71,2015-08-13 21:39:00,1311,Man I hate to hear when the yammys go down ..I've got a 60 tiller as well with a zillion hrs ..let us know asap ..don't sound to healthy thou
929432,ecmilley,2015-08-14 01:10:00,2163,"check oil dipstick for bearing/metal debris, check lower unit for same, since noise didnt diminish with spark plug removal gonna guess bearing went bad in driveshaft ann caused a overheat when it took out water pump turning alarm on just guessing though"
929435,Sinker,2015-08-14 01:19:00,8692,"That sucks Mike! Doesnt souNd good! Im a true yammy fan, but these newer ones seem to be letting go too early with serious issues.  I have a 93 yammy built mariner that just keeps going. Ive been talking about upgrading for years and years now, but it just keeps going....lol  Good luck, and keep us posted on the results!  S."
929455,Mister G,2015-08-14 11:40:00,1429,"Had similar thing happen to my 30 year old Johnson. The dealer basically said it's not worth repairing, so I upgraded to a new E-TEC and that baby came with a 7 year warranty........but that deal may  have ended in March. However they usually offer a 5 year warranty at the end of the year (September) to clear out old inventory at the dealers. If you need a new outboard, think that one over. BTW my dealer dealt in Yammies and E-TEC so I had my choice. I REALLY love the new E-TEC's."
929457,Dutch,2015-08-14 11:57:00,831,"Any scortched plugs or metal debris on them? If not, prob not a piston issue."
929460,Beavertail,2015-08-14 12:15:00,331,"Sorry to hear about your motor troubles, what a let down that can be. Hope it's not too serious, IS still covered by warranty and you're back out on the water soon. I'm curious to hear what the issue is."
929461,Dara,2015-08-14 12:37:00,3052,"Get to the original dealer. As said by others, Yammie doesn't cross border warranty, I found that out with my sled. Bought in Canada and no warranty in US..long srory.  Just get to the dealer and they will likely warranty...call now and tell them so the date is recorded if you can't get there right away."
929473,mike rousseau,2015-08-14 13:46:00,4661,Already called the dealer and they started a work order so I fall into warranty...  And I agree to bringbitvto the dealer...  I was just seeing if we could figure out the problem to make sure it's worth the $200-$300 I'll be spending in gas for 2 round trips and me burning 2 half days to do it...  If I knew what it was and it's under $500 to fix id jelust get it repaired locally   Thanks for all the input fellas...  I'm gunna drop the lower unit today then run it to see if it's in the lower unit or in the engine...  Also gunna pull the plugs and check lower unit oil
929479,Garnet,2015-08-14 14:06:00,2056,You will be happy it's a US dealer.  Here if they say 2 weeks it's coming from US. If they say 3 weeks it's on a boat and your season is done.
929486,KraTToR,2015-08-14 14:35:00,506,"Already called... My dealer is a few hours away in NY State tho... Want to make sure it's not minor before towing across the boarder   Video is coming  Noise like that is anything but minor.  Even if the dealer balks at providing warranty work, contact Yamaha directly.  There's a very good chance they'll cover it.  Good luck and I hope you're not off the water very long.  Best fishing of the year is right around the corner.."
929487,misfish,2015-08-14 14:35:00,29133,"Good to hear Mike. There,s a company that wants your business again"
929495,Cast-Away,2015-08-14 15:34:00,790,"Mike I wouldn't touch the lower end if you are already bringing it in. You could void the warranty, let them deal with it."
929497,davew3,2015-08-14 15:36:00,430,Mike   why aren't you on the road or are you ?
929519,mike rousseau,2015-08-14 17:54:00,4661,"Bringing it tomorrow...  I dropped the lower unit and the sound was still there so I know it's top end...  Called the marina again and told them everything I could including that the sound is there with the lower unit removed and they basically said it'll be warranty as long as I ""didn't run it dry on oil or something stupid""...."
929521,mike rousseau,2015-08-14 17:56:00,4661,Because I have responsibilities in life like children and a job.... It's 2 hours each way so I need 4+ hours to do the trip
