930851,esoxansteel,2015-08-23 14:52:00,1307,Would she settle for a sweet blue St Croix  LT
930866,2 tone z71,2015-08-23 15:50:00,1311,I'm trying ..that's what I use ..but ever since I got her that avid pearl she's got that glitter in her eye lol
930873,Tom McCutcheon,2015-08-23 16:47:00,627,St. Croix makes the Muskie Mojo and it is a nice purple/mauve shade..... and a lot less expensive than an Avid or Legend
