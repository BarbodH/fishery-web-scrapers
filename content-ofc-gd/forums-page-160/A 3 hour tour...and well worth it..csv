931168,fishnsled,2015-08-25 03:23:00,3520,"As was stated in the Lake O thread, it's been a tough couple of years for many.  Sunday gave me a sign of hope.  The forecast was for a very narrow window to fish before those east winds really got going, so Rubin and I decided to go for it.  On the water bright and early with the winds already starting to blow,  a far cry from the calm that was suppose to be.  We made the bumpy ride east as to troll with the winds back to the harbour.  Lines were down at 6:30 and shortly afterwards a small bow of 2 pounds is in the boat, it was a start.  Reset the rod and continued to troll deeper until the winds said to turn west at 7am.  Well shortly after turning west the dipsey fires with a screamer and Rubin is up.  With his fish about 80ft back, the other dipsey fires with another screamer.  Decide to let that fish run figuring it had hooked itself and I cleared one of the other rods.  I net Rubin's fish and grab the other rod and start my battle.  A pair of long overdue beauties.        With the lines all reset I thought I'd pour a coffee and relax but no time for that as another rod goes off.  This time with a nice bow for Rubin.     Line reset and reached for the coffee and another rod goes off, another screamer.  This one had some attitude and wanted nothing to do with the net but we succeeded.    Line reset, I look at my coffee and I do manged a few sips before another line goes zinging off.     Line reset and can't imagine the day getting any better when the rigger rod fires with the Lyman on it.  I've never had any luck with them but it was one of those days.     Looked at the time as the winds were starting to blow pretty good...9am. With some of the waves pushing the 4-5 ft mark, we decided to call it a day. As much as it pained me to do it, most likely the better decision.    A trip that we'll remember for a very long time."
931177,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-25 04:47:00,10439,Nice!!! I remember many good days fishing out of Port Credit when I still lived back East.
931178,Freshtrax,2015-08-25 05:25:00,2215,I dream of days like that.   Nice going.
931181,spincast,2015-08-25 08:53:00,3279,Great day - man I miss those outings! There is still hope (even if I have to drive to Port Hope)
931197,limeyangler,2015-08-25 12:39:00,5204,"Great day on the lake, perfect in fact by the looks of the pictures!"
931206,mr blizzard,2015-08-25 13:19:00,1589,Awesome  and like Freshtrax said I dream of days like that lol Good for you
931218,Headhunter,2015-08-25 14:32:00,5703,"That's good shootin boys! Thanks for the invite Will, but I didn't hit the hay until 3:00am with folks still partying well into the night. Hopefully, next time. HH"
931225,fishnsled,2015-08-25 14:57:00,3520,"Thanks for the comments gents.  I dreamed of days like those as well, nice to experience it...actually bloody awesome to experience it! The weird thing of the day was that we did not mark any bait and not even a fish.  Not that I'm complaining about it!"
931234,CRUD150,2015-08-25 16:42:00,87,Nice! A day you will not soon forget.
931253,Joey,2015-08-25 18:35:00,9122,"Awesome Will, looks like a nice day with some beauty fish.  Those winds sure can get nasty though!!!!"
931263,captpierre,2015-08-25 19:45:00,2521,Well done. Glad to hear the fishery isn't dead Good shootin
931265,misfish,2015-08-25 19:56:00,29133,Thats a great day Wil and  you got a full body/fish pic of Rub.
931279,tonyb,2015-08-25 21:43:00,1637,"Nice to get a mix of Steelies with those Kings.  Incredible fishing out east...I call it Salmon Nirvana, and I tell locals that fish out that way how good they have it.  Many of the regulars that fish these eastern ports call the fishing dismal this year...clearly they haven't spent much time in Mississauga or Oakville LOL  Great pictures considering how much you must have been getting tossed around.  Worth getting up early and making the drive too!"
931298,HTHM,2015-08-25 23:29:00,4082,So the lesson here is to have a coffee on the go?
931299,Steve,2015-08-25 23:31:00,2075,awesome report!!!  so very jealous to see those beauty kings....but seriously glad to see someone on them....  great stuff!

931324,ccmtcanada,2015-08-26 01:46:00,7971,Nicely done guys!!!
931325,fishnsled,2015-08-26 01:48:00,3520,"Thats a great day Wil and  you got a full body/fish pic of Rub.  There is always one without....      Tony, I'd be one of those complaining about the east end the last couple of years but not nearly as bad as the stories from the west.  We usually get a few but size and numbers have been a challenge till this trip.  A lot of it has to be just putting your time in as there are some great reports coming from the east.  Hope to be back at it this weekend.  HTHM - A very good insulated coffee mug is critical.  Mine it rated to keep beverages hot for 4-6 hours I believe."
931360,Headhunter,2015-08-26 13:53:00,5703,"Yah, that's definitely the best shot of the bunch!!! LMAO! HH"
