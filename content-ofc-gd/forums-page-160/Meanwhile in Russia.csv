Too bad the bear didn't free himself as that guy was hoofing it's back, and took out its frustration on the guy instead of the tire. I hope there was a lot of vodka involved, not sure how else to comprehend this??"

931085,Kingsalmon,2015-08-24 20:57:00,107,Question is: Who went out to change the flat tire?
931088,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-24 21:16:00,10439,Question is: Who went out to change the flat tire?  I would just drive on the flat until I hit Hungary and then i would pull out the spare!!
