931083,TJQ,2015-08-24 20:46:00,7806,"Its been a crazy summer full of obligations, weddings and funerals  uhhg, that our trips to camp just kept being put off and put off.. finally we managed to put a time together for the family to get up there.  Im really thinking that next summer were gonna have to put our time away as a priority and not ""well get there when we can...""  We hadnt been in since June so every time its a suprise as to whether things will still be in one piece and happily they were!!  No trees down although the 4km trail in has grown in alot.  It was nice to be home.  (please forgive the pictures.. camera was packed some of the time... had to use the phone)        Monique and I were in for a few days before the kids arrived and got some great fishing in every year since we have been going theres a strong year class of pike that are just getting bigger and bigger.  And the bass are getting huge.          Sometimes I just cant hold them out far enough though....    Kids came in and the weather turned even nicer.. no hot days, to the point where we had a small fire inside at night to get the humidity out.  Jadens friend hadn't fished much before and had certainly never top watered or trolled, had a blast  She didnt want to touch the fish at first and then by the end of the trip we had her kissing them lol...            It was great.. with the kids getting older, its harder and harder to corral them into the same spot.      "

931159,Cast-Away,2015-08-25 02:26:00,790,I love the jiggy reports and did notice less and less of them. For sure you have to book a week with the kids in January when they are planning out their year.  We just got back from our annual week on 12 Mile Bay on GBay. Been doing this since 2001 and it is their highlight for the year!
