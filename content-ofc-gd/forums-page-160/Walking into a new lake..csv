So the day before yesterday we got a chance to spend some time together on my day off. We walked a portage into a lake I have been wanting to check out but had never got around to before.  Jack was very excited about the ""secret lake"", and he has been chattering about our adventure for the past 2 days, needless to say fun was had!  "
