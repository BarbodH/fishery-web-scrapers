930871,JoshS,2015-08-23 16:22:00,729,Browsing cabelas and considering adding a few quarts of this to my order.  Does anyone have any opinions on this stuff? Any good?  
930883,Fisherman,2015-08-23 17:38:00,7201,"Cabelas does not make oil, it's rebranded from some other company.  Do some googling and then go buy the appropriate amsoil synthetic, either for premix or injector."
930884,Garnet,2015-08-23 17:49:00,2056,If you are currently using synthetic maybe. Never heard of a semi synthetic oil .  If you were using a natural oil and decided switch to synthetic the whole system needs to be drained and start over with.  Natural and synthetic are not happy together and your motor will blow-up.  That Mystic stuff from BPS is natural and it's likely fine just don't mix with synthetic.

930927,ecmilley,2015-08-23 22:25:00,2163,whats the price? i use to use ams hp injector oil but to to availabilty issues in my area been using lucas semi-syn get it for around the $35 a gallon (3.78l) point.
930942,Garnet,2015-08-23 23:51:00,2056,Keep playing with fire.
930945,Fisherman,2015-08-23 23:59:00,7201,"Been playing with the fire since 1978, nothings blown up or worn out other than the naysayers."
930948,John Bacon,2015-08-24 00:18:00,3277,"If mixing sythetic and natural oil is so bad, then why do they sell a blend of synthetic and natural oil (aka semi-synthetic)?"

930966,Mister G,2015-08-24 01:29:00,1429,Keep playing with fire. This oil is OEM in ford vehicles.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/201410982392?ul_noapp=true&chn=ps&lpid=82
930995,Garnet,2015-08-24 10:46:00,2056,"Another thing you guys don't want to hear is 2 strokes Love good oil. At the rate you are changing oil for a few dollars I assume happy savings.  When I raced motocross you could tell the motors with cheap oil even if they had 3-4 hrs on a set of rings.  Also were I learned to not mix natural with synthetic it's a gunk show.  With new motors I use the factory oil until long after warranty then make 1 switch to good quality after market oil. Last motor did blow up but it had over 1400 hrs on a bass boat. It was a cracked water jacket, the pistons, walls and rings great shape."

It's around the same price... 9 bucks a quart.  Hmm...  haven't heard that mixing semi-synthetic with regular oil is bad. I do not run synthetic now. Is there any truth to this? Should I stick with the natural stuff? I run a '04 merc 75hp oil injection 2stroke.
931028,JoePa,2015-08-24 14:56:00,179,"Just google - ""Is it ok to mix natural oil with synthetic oils"" -  you'll find out that it is ok - synthetic oils have better qualities that normal oils - so if you mix these oils you will be reducing the qualities of the synthetic oil -"

I can't see a 2-stroke blowing up because you're mixing different kinds of premix"
931048,Sinker,2015-08-24 17:29:00,8692,"Ive used all types of oil in my old 2 stroke withno issues, although I do stick to quality oil unless I cant get it.  Ive even mixed synthetic with dino in the same tank.  I do the same in my beater car......its got 398K on it now with no issues.  Anyone have proof of an engine blowing up, id love to see it!  S."
931069,Garnet,2015-08-24 19:37:00,2056,I guess the difference is I've had my hands in all kinds of 2 strokes. Maybe they have improved the formula I still wouldn't do it.  I also wouldn't buy cheap brands made in some third world country with a chemist from cracker box U.  Cheap oils are carbon factory's and 1 look you can tell the owner has been using garbage. Mixing natural oil and synthetic looks stringy and goopy.  Like my engines running clean.
931071,irishfield,2015-08-24 20:12:00,26272,Like the late 70's and pulling a rocker cover to find deep amounts of beige sludge and you knew the guy was running Quaker State ....
931075,Fisherman,2015-08-24 20:21:00,7201,"78 Diesel rabbit with a lot of miles, had to replace the oil pan gasket, no sludge or build up anywhere, upper engine just as clean.  Synthetic since then on everything."
931077,mr blizzard,2015-08-24 20:26:00,1589,"Honest question, learning new things here, thanks  I have used traditional oil for years and then switched to synthetic  Question,,,,when would someone use semi synthetic and why do they have it in the first place"
931090,Mister G,2015-08-24 21:35:00,1429,Quaker State in the 70's was one on the better oils because it was a wax base oil compared to sulfer based oil from Texas. sludge in the upper rocker arms was usually from someone adding STP to their oil.
931096,Garnet,2015-08-24 22:05:00,2056,Use strait STP on old wreck cars my boss sold cheap. Never burn a drop of oil (for a week or 2). And he got a lot of motor swap jobs.
931130,Fisherman,2015-08-25 00:28:00,7201,"Honest question, learning new things here, thanks  I have used traditional oil for years and then switched to synthetic  Question,,,,when would someone use semi synthetic and why do they have it in the first place Cheaper alternative, although to really get the benefits of syn oil, you may as well go the distance.  I use the 100% stuff in my car and truck, once a year oil change for the truck, car gets a filter change half way and a top up.  Nothing has blown up or burns oil.  I had an old 91 Jetta that was treated the same way, passed  air ever other year clean test pretty much at factory spec."
