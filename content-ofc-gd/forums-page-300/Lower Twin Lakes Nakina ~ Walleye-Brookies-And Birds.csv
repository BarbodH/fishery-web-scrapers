638021,solopaddler,2011-11-07 13:42:00,8605,"Thanks guys, glad you enjoyed!     I know, I know. Did you happen to look at the short video clip I included of him landing a small walleye?  Watch it right to the end. Typical Ferg LOL!"
638029,corvette1,2011-11-07 13:58:00,1765,awesome report as allways mike the colors on the trout were outstanding nice gators too
638073,johnnyb,2011-11-07 15:13:00,3413,Beautiful stuff there....and drive-to!  Great report and definitely getting added to the list.  All those brookie pics have got me a bit lightheaded actually...
638076,Leecher,2011-11-07 15:16:00,7832,"That was certainly worth the wait Mike Fall colors on those brookies are just amazing Great report, fish, pics & videos Thanks for sharing Leechman"
638089,hutch4113,2011-11-07 15:53:00,374,"Thanks for the report.  Would you recommend it over the fly in to Nakina, or is it about the same?  That other lake sounds interesting...(the one not fished)."
638092,Jds63,2011-11-07 16:09:00,1365,"great report Mike, those specks are amazing"
638096,fishnsled,2011-11-07 16:17:00,3520,Been waiting for this for a while and it was certainly worth the wait. Awesome report Mike! Those specks sure are purdy.
638120,strakey,2011-11-07 17:54:00,78,Mike nice fishing trip you had. Im a tad jealous. I would love to see some sharpies put up because being from Timmins I had never had any other bird except for ruffies and spruce (not great eatin). Great lookin trout!!
638174,misfish,2011-11-07 21:05:00,29133,Another great trip and report Mike. Enjoyed the pics and read.   Thanks for taking the time.
638189,BillM,2011-11-07 22:05:00,17367,I knew I should have gone on this trip.  Awesome fish Mike!
638265,Rod Caster,2011-11-08 00:18:00,5784,Brookies below the fog.  Great report Mike. It's a wildlife haven up there.  
638329,Moosebunk,2011-11-08 02:27:00,3970,"Sweet deal Mike.  They're not giant fish for your usual standards but each and every specimen look to be in just prime health.  The pike's pattern is pretty cool and the specks are just perfect in color for the season.  Your poor wife must have missed ya all spring, summer and half of fall long bud.  You've sure been out gettin' around.    Rewards of your life choices you getting to chase your passions Mike."
640910,wantabigone,2011-11-17 21:06:00,97,wow- gorgeous colours on those. My group and I stayed at twin lakes but we never fished it. We arrived late and flew out the next day for Eddie's. Now I know what we missed!
640962,SirCranksalot,2011-11-18 00:24:00,3291,"Well color me green!!!  SP,  From earlier posts I understand that you have also fished Esnagami. A small group of us is looking at going to Es. in 2012, but from your post it looks like lower twin might be as good or better. How would you compare the 2? Thx"
793704,rocko0305,2013-06-20 19:33:00,6,"Mike, any chance you got the pictures from your buddy of his grouse hunting?  I would love to see them if you happened to get them.  Thanks."
793705,solopaddler,2013-06-20 19:41:00,8605," Surprised to see this one dredged up, although it was a great trip.  As far as pictures of the grouse go, sorry I don't have any. My buddy ""may"" still have some, I'll ask when I see him.  Cheers"
793731,JoshS,2013-06-20 22:09:00,729,MAN I love these reports. Looks like an awesome time. Those brookies are beautiful! Thanks for taking the time to put it up.
637677,frozen-fire,2011-11-05 21:42:00,542,Absolutely stunning colours on those specks.
637679,Basskicker,2011-11-05 21:48:00,421,"That's awesome Mike, some beauty specks!!!  I can't believe it, but I've fished that lake with my buddy before we flew into Eddies...too cool.  Thanks for sharing.  Jason"
637683,adolson,2011-11-05 22:17:00,783,Wow. Just wow. I am a tad jealous. Wow.
637691,camillj,2011-11-05 22:56:00,1988,I got a cramp in my eye looking at those beauties !
637693,Skud,2011-11-05 23:00:00,739,Once again great report. Those trout are beautiful. Yes I know my report(s) are well over due. I just added another chapter this week too.

637704,danc,2011-11-05 23:42:00,4677,"Incredible colors on those Brookies Mike. They look so much like Bunks Char photos. While working in Nakina a few years back, we'd get a Walleye limit in minutes in the river connecting Twin Lakes. Thanks for the memories. And the report."
637708,Gregoire,2011-11-06 00:13:00,1397,Great report thanks for sharing
637709,NAW,2011-11-06 00:14:00,4022,I really enjoyed reading that.  I've never been moose hunting. but hacking the lower part of the legs off seems very common.  Must make it easier to get out of the bush.  Great report and pics.  Thanks!
637716,chris.brock,2011-11-06 00:33:00,4053,Hey Solo  Does the outfitter know what species are in Wababimiga?
637729,ccmtcanada,2011-11-06 00:53:00,7971,Wow Mike!  I've seen you with lots of pike and walleye before! But those brookies are incredible!  Looked like an awesome time....wish I could have gone in with you on that trip!
637735,msp,2011-11-06 01:13:00,1336,Some really nice brookies. I dont think anybody goes on as many fishing trips as you do. You definetly have an understanding wife at home. Not to mention all the steelhead excusions in between.
637745,TennesseeGuy,2011-11-06 01:49:00,957,"Mike, you really put those 5 September days to good use.  Thanks for the report.  The colors on those brookies would make a sunset jealous."
637763,rob v,2011-11-06 03:36:00,535,fantastic - thanks for sharing
637767,4x4bassin,2011-11-06 04:19:00,1025,"Great report as always Mike , those are some real nice specks !"
637774,solopaddler,2011-11-06 08:22:00,8605,"Thanks guys, glad you enjoyed!     Small world eh buddy? Did you guys do well when you fished it?    I was wondering about you. Where you been at?   Walleye and pike my friend.    Cliff, next time I'll give you a bit more notice. And trust me there will be a next time."
637782,Joey,2011-11-06 11:08:00,9122,"Excellent report Mike, beautiful specks"
637799,northernpike56,2011-11-06 13:24:00,717,amazing speckles!!!
637805,Guidofisherman,2011-11-06 13:44:00,206,Great report with lots of fishing variety at that drive-to camp. Loved the fall colours on the male trout.
637902,Musky or Specks,2011-11-06 23:05:00,2710,"Dang I tried that bridge this spring but couldn't come up with anything. Thanks for the report Mike, worth the wait. 5 days for Nakina seems pretty rushed but when your hardcore a day of driving there and back makes up for three great days of fishing."
637930,adempsey,2011-11-07 01:14:00,1498,"Great to read a report from a drive-to camp in that region.  Thanks, was a good read."
637950,Cookslav,2011-11-07 02:27:00,1457,"Looks like and Awesome trip, and for the most part some nice Fall weather....gotta love the adversity the fall can offer.  Funny how picky those polka dot beauties can be on lure choice yet when you find the right one...it can turn into a frenzie.  Cheers,"
637967,Victor,2011-11-07 04:35:00,1609,"wow, the color on those are absolutely stunning.  thanks for taking the time to share with us."
