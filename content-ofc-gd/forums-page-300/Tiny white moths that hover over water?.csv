793592,Rattletrap2,2013-06-20 00:52:00,1652,Anyone know what type of insect I am describing? I see thousands of these tiny white moths flying (hovering) over the surface of our pond. The fish are having a field day jumping for them! I can't seem to identify what these flies are. Eventually they wind up in the water dead and floating on the surface Early evening seems to be their most prolific time.
793594,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-20 01:12:00,10439,Probably Mayflies.  What you're seeing in the evening is called a spinner fall. The mayflies are mating and after mating they die.
793595,kickingfrog,2013-06-20 01:17:00,8333,Caddis? sp?
793596,Rattletrap2,2013-06-20 01:18:00,1652,Thanks Drifter. Is a Caddis Fly the same thing? I found a video of Caddis Flies that looks like it might be similar.
793597,chris.brock,2013-06-20 01:19:00,4053,how tiny? mayflies are a fair size  midges are almost cloudlike that float on the breeze
793601,timmeh,2013-06-20 01:43:00,609,"Most likely caddis, more mothlike than mayflies."
793602,Rattletrap2,2013-06-20 01:59:00,1652,I have video....just cannot for the life of me...remember how to post it! lol
793603,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-20 02:01:00,10439,Caddis is possible too though they are usually grey to tan or brown in colour. Mayflies come in many sizes from tiny (.1 inch) to giant (over an inch) depending on species as well.   May Fly    Caddis Fly  
793604,Roe Bag,2013-06-20 02:04:00,246,You were probably witnessing a Caddis fly hatch. They hatch in the water. Rise to the surface. Spread their wings and fly. Takes them a while to get airborne while shedding water from their wings. In the meantime they are fair game for surface feeding fish.          Caddis fly imitations are great for stream trout. Used them for Mooneye as well. Lots of fun on a light flyrod
793611,Christopheraaron,2013-06-20 02:48:00,3525,get the fly gear out!
793722,Dabluz,2013-06-20 21:27:00,701,Caddis flies leave the water immediately when hatching.
