793643,Garnet,2013-06-20 14:01:00,2056,"I like having seasons. As each approaches the excitement builds, I start getting bored with whacking the crap out of walleye, get the sticks ready and finally it's here.  You can't legislate morality so I don't get upset seeing losers fishing bass or walleye or anything out of season.  There are professionals to deal with these people and they do get more than you think.  If the CO lays a charge and that person just pays the fine nobody hears about it. Down on Bowmanville creek last fall 20k in fines were handed out. Just a few that go to court will be heard about."
793644,BillM,2013-06-20 14:11:00,17367," Fish being pulled off beds, then other fish like crappie, bluegill and sunfish swarming in and eating fry will have a greater effect on the population then someone filling a white bucket, let's be realistic here.  Let's not forget the growing seasons in the US are probably what, double of ours?"
793645,Angler management,2013-06-20 14:20:00,280,"Well said Garnet! Regardless of what i just said about bass, i would rather keep the season we have then put any more pressure on them. I just think too many ppl got their panties in a bunch over one week earlier opener."
793649,Angler management,2013-06-20 14:27:00,280,Lets not forget they are over-populated and it wouldnt hurt to take a few off their beds... Hence why the mnr opened up the season early in these over-populated areas.
793650,fish_fishburn,2013-06-20 14:37:00,1311,Season opens here for bass tomorrow. Noticed 2 big bass boats with three in each boat pounding the smallies yesterday. by the sounds of them they were having a great time. I got out of my car and yelled to them that bass opens friday and they said they were fishing for Northerns and Picks.  Spinnerbaits tubes abd senkos were the hot baits. Gotta get the poacher # on my phone. These idiots give us bassboat owners a bad name.

793652,BillM,2013-06-20 14:45:00,17367, Since when was bass ever considered overpopulated in FMZ17?
793653,Angler management,2013-06-20 14:46:00,280,"Unfortunately there isnt too much you can do against idiots like that... Even if the mnr showed up, i dont think they could do anything unless they were possesing the bass. I go pike fishing often, and my fav. Lures to use are swimbaits, spinnerbaits and crankbaits. Catch a ton of pike with them alongside of bass. Cant a void it without sacraficing pike action."
793655,Angler management,2013-06-20 14:49:00,280,Since u get one every cast on any lure you pull out of your tackle box. Im sure you could tie a dog turd on a line with no hook and go to scugog and catch a bunch... If thats not overpopulated then what is?
793656,BillM,2013-06-20 14:53:00,17367," Ah ok, so it's your opinion... That's what I thought."
793657,fish_fishburn,2013-06-20 14:53:00,1311,tks Jedi its now on the phone.
793659,Angler management,2013-06-20 14:54:00,280,Ofcourse it is. Im writing it... I dont speak on behalf o anybody.
793673,chris.brock,2013-06-20 15:46:00,4053,
793683,Angler management,2013-06-20 16:25:00,280,"May not be like that where you fish, but if u fish a lake in zone 17, and it holds bass... Chances are that the bass outnumber other species by a lot."
793686,wkimwes,2013-06-20 16:55:00,76,"Also spawning bass/beds are normally harder to catch, so in general it won't be easy for anyone to catch them.  Hence why the it's fine in most states to have it open year round.  NY - Has a no live bait rule until June to late fall for bass.  Other than that you can catch bass with artificial lures.  As for the question who else has late spawns - Maine, Minnesota, Michigan, New Hampshire..most of the north east corridor.  I haven't checked their regs bust most are open to C&R during spawn season and nothing kept until after a May/June."
793692,highdrifter,2013-06-20 17:49:00,2534,Maybe they're getting harassed by worm dunkers while they're in the shallows...
793300,beagle dad,2013-06-18 13:30:00,224,was on rice lake on weekend caught lots of bass thing is 14 of 1st 16 fish where small females full of eggs running out of them all where caught in 8 ft +  of water whats going on??????
793312,BillM,2013-06-18 15:25:00,17367,They are still spawning...  Are you really surprised with the weather we've had?
793313,beagle dad,2013-06-18 15:50:00,224,these fish were not near nesting area that's the surprise
793315,BillM,2013-06-18 15:59:00,17367,"Maybe they were sick of waiting for the weather, lol."
793317,hirk,2013-06-18 16:21:00,571,"im surprised because i fished the same water on the other side of the dam 6-10 fow and out of 40ish 1-2 lb largies never saw a single egg???????? the small fish do generally spawn last though, a survival of the fittest mechanisim"
793319,beagle dad,2013-06-18 16:28:00,224,went shallow to see if any fish nesting......no bass but tons of sunfish and perch actually sitting on beds
793330,206,2013-06-18 17:29:00,563,On Scugog river for opener and witness a big large mouth go under the knife....Full of eggs!
793333,kickingfrog,2013-06-18 17:54:00,8333,"The females don't stay on the reds. Not all the eggs are released during a spawn. And smaller fish do not always spawn, although that is more likely to be males."
793335,beagle dad,2013-06-18 18:05:00,224,when you lip a bass and eggs run out its not a male
793338,kickingfrog,2013-06-18 18:14:00,8333,Hence the although.
793339,kickingfrog,2013-06-18 18:15:00,8333,Were these saggy bellied fish? Or were they bursting with eggs?
793340,beagle dad,2013-06-18 18:19:00,224,fish in 8-10ft off shore...off spawning bays saggy yes and busting with eggs
793341,kickingfrog,2013-06-18 18:25:00,8333,Sounds like they may have already spawned.
793347,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-18 19:25:00,8243,"Not all female bass of all strains spawn. Depends on age, disease and numbers of males available to them for a date. I am quoting from what I have been told over the years. You won't ever see a female on a bed once they have spawned. Males make the nest, milt the eggs and then once the coffee ground size fry has hatched the males guard the nest of fry.."
793371,Pigeontroller,2013-06-18 22:40:00,2793,It was a bad year for the early opener...Now last year...
793372,Big Cliff,2013-06-18 22:47:00,6899,Bass eggs = good cavier
793374,gaspumper,2013-06-18 23:02:00,393,"After all they are only bass,not a real fish."
793563,beagle dad,2013-06-19 20:28:00,224,  cavier???   yuk....ask when you go east for some...lol   not sure you like what you get
793607,chris.brock,2013-06-20 02:26:00,4053,"seems like the MNR has the King Midas touch, but everything they touch turns to pooh,  ""yeah, lets bump up the bass opener, at least for the sake of actually doing something and justifying our jobs""  bass recruitment will be poor for 2013, at least we got to go out a week earlier, whoa!"
793608,chris.brock,2013-06-20 02:32:00,4053,"there's plenty of fishing opportunities in the spring/ early summer, err on the side of caution, southern and central Ontario bass don't need anymore pressure, we're going the wrong way"
793626,Angler management,2013-06-20 11:38:00,280,"I get what youre saying, but lets be realistic... Our waters are jammed full of bass, and maybe 1% of anglers keep them for the plate. There is no danger even if we fished them all year. Many places in the states do, and they have no issues."
793636,BillM,2013-06-20 12:59:00,17367," How many places in the US have spawning bass in June?  I bet not many if any at all...  There's a reason why the season is closed until late June up here.  Some years I've caught bass off deep weed edges during the pike opener, some years (like this year) it's a late season and the fish are still doing their thing in the shallows."
793637,Angler management,2013-06-20 13:06:00,280,"Regardless of when they are spawning, they are being fished year round. And its not affecting their population because they still over-run lakes and nobody keeps them so the population stays plentiful. However u wonna look at it, theyre over-populated and are affecting other fish species population. I dont think we would have any issues if the season was open all year."
793638,chris.brock,2013-06-20 13:23:00,4053," I don't agree with 1% keeping them, in Haliburton, the rednecks and the not so serious cottage fishing crowd keep plenty, the serious bass guys let them go  my cottage neighbor kept 2- 5lbs LM and some decent smaller fish out of a small back lake last summer, it was a pretty ugly stringer picture that he was proud to show me"
793641,Angler management,2013-06-20 13:57:00,280,"I definetly underestimated when i said 1%... But what im trying to say is, not enough anglers keep them to affect the population. People who are hardcore anglers dont tend to keep them, because they would target other species for a fish-fry. Its the people that dont fish often that generally tend to keep bass for eating. Either way, not many of them wind up on the dinner table."
