793831,super dave,2013-06-21 15:06:00,323,I got a day with my nephew tomorrow and was thinking of taking him fishing at a local reservoir.  we have done this a few times but thinking I might try something new like fishing the grand from a kayak.  I've never gone here before.  Can someone tell me if there is a good place to launch from and take out?  i'll probably just call a cab to get back to put in.  any advice is appreciated.  Thanks.
793840,Musky or Specks,2013-06-21 16:56:00,2710,You could put in at Bridge St in Kitchener and take out at the end of Forwell RD when you come to the water pump house. About a 4 hr trip but pretty close by cab to the put in
793853,DOS,2013-06-21 18:20:00,119,Where on the grand are you thinking.  Belwood and upper grand there are lots of spots. May have some trouble with the rapids south of Elora though  Further south I dont know much about it.  RED
793867,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-21 20:00:00,8243,"I agree the Grand is a large body of water. The lower Grand, down river of Dunnville has been a washout this year for fishing, with all the rain it is like chocolate milk. I haven't heard of any fish of note being caught yet. I wouldn't bother down here."
793869,Rich,2013-06-21 20:30:00,3927,The paris stretch is quick and has some good smallie holes. Thats where I would hit.
793870,super dave,2013-06-21 20:49:00,323,"sorry.  i was thinking of the paris to brantford area.  Rich, do you know of any take out points?  I'll probably put in below the dam in paris."
793873,Rich,2013-06-21 21:23:00,3927,There is a portage ramp on the right hand side of the river (going downstream) just above brant park. That's where people usually pull their canoes out..
793879,timmeh,2013-06-21 21:42:00,609,"Smallies in any stretch of the river, it really depends on where you want to go.  Keep in mind the Paris stretch is special regs (no live bait, single barbless hook, catch and release)."
793882,northernpike56,2013-06-21 22:07:00,717,"I think there are a lot of bowfin down there. They are probably one of the coolest fish imo and I'd love to catch more of them, but I guess a lot of people on here would probably disagree lol"
793883,northernpike56,2013-06-21 22:08:00,717,"I will also vote paris above the dam. Amazing smallie water, I'd say you could probably get about 20 each drifiting a 4-5 hour stretch just casting a mepps."
793900,spincast,2013-06-22 00:57:00,3279,"launch at Glen Morris, run down to Paris. Takes 2 - 4 hours depending on where and how often you stop (and the wind). Easy stretch and no special regs.  Done it many a time and had  a blast."
793905,registerfly,2013-06-22 01:50:00,198,"that's the stretch we do couple times a year, some real good smallie spots and as mentioned no regs. Cabs are at the lot by the dam and will run $22 back to Glen Morris. I prefer this section to the Paris-Brantford section."
