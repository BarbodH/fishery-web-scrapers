793685,wkimwes,2013-06-20 16:46:00,76,"See the Guelph Lake, Mountsberg and Kelso Lake thread.  Also, Shades Mill and Puslinch lake could be an option."
793703,leaf4,2013-06-20 19:25:00,2466,"what depths does mountsberg get to? and shades mill is supposedly good but no one I know has gotten anything worthwhile there lol, trying to search for somewhere with walleye"
793711,Rich,2013-06-20 20:39:00,3927,Small walleye lakes in that area? Doubt you'll find any worthwhile ones.  There's walleye in puslinch but I've never seen one.
793721,leaf4,2013-06-20 21:27:00,2466,I keep on getting told about all of the walleye in the grand but the only thing I ever see getting caught there is bass sunfish and the odd trout haha
793723,Rich,2013-06-20 21:32:00,3927,"There certainly is walleye in the Grand. They stick to pretty specific areas and very few are all that easily accessible. You could always take your canoe up above the Cambridge dam. It's deep and slow, wide like a lake (obviously steer clear of the dam) and has the species you're looking for."
793736,leaf4,2013-06-20 23:04:00,2466,Thanks for the input! will definitely check it out.  tight lines!
793759,northernpike56,2013-06-21 01:53:00,717,belwood has walleye but watch out for the high performance boats
