793945,snagged,2013-06-22 16:37:00,67,A buddy of mind caught this at Cordova lake. Hard to tell from pics but this fish doesn't have sucker type mouth. Some of these caught were a foot long. I was thinking it was a chub but not sure. Any ideas what type of fish this is? 
793946,BillM,2013-06-22 16:42:00,17367,Looks like a big creek chub.
793948,gaspumper,2013-06-22 16:54:00,393,Fall fish
793950,Sinker,2013-06-22 16:56:00,8692,Fall fish for sure.  S.
793952,snagged,2013-06-22 16:58:00,67,I googled creek chub and fall fish and they both look like this fish. Torpedo shaped and the mouth was shallow and very rounded. Black back with silver sides.
793955,Joeytier,2013-06-22 17:40:00,3990,Thats a fall fish.  Ive seen them up to 15 16 inches in the ott riv.  Disappointing when youre walleye fishing thats for sure
