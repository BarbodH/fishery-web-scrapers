792869,smitty55,2013-06-16 20:35:00,928,Funny you ask. I was just talking to a bud who nailed the walleye yesterday with those new raps. He loved it. I didn't get which series he was using though. Working weed edges he said.
792899,FloatnFly,2013-06-16 22:46:00,1640,"just checked the bps werbsite, a lot of them are available as back orders lol"
792916,big guy,2013-06-16 23:32:00,414,"I just ordered a bunch from Cabelas, 8 or 9 of them, in the shad and crank shapes. They also make them in minnow and countdown. Anyway, Cabelas had them all in stock, got my shipment in 1 week, great service again.  Haven't used them yet, but can't wait, sometime this week"
792919,tbayboy,2013-06-16 23:42:00,1497,Caught a few eyes trolling the shad rap version on the opener until it was donated to a submerged tree .  Can't say it outperformed traditional shad raps but certainly didn't underperform them.
