706809,Roy,2012-06-18 13:27:00,13728," Ummm, it was a joke guys."
706863,Millhouse2020,2012-06-18 16:17:00,152,"  That's an interesting hypothesis.  Although no one can know for sure, this theory makes lots of sense."
706870,Harrison,2012-06-18 16:26:00,2202,Just theory but I think it may be a sign a fish is on its way out.  I have seen Salmon in the fall do it while on their last leg.
706922,JoshS,2012-06-18 18:48:00,729,"I've actually seen this twice! Once 12 years ago and again 4 years back. Both times on the same body of water, at night, and both times large thick female pike over 35 inches. The second time I saw it, it was a super calm, very bright night and I could see the thing coming from a mile away toward the dock, I thought it was a beaver until it almost ran into the dock. It must of had it's head out of the water for close to ten minutes.  The digesting theory sounds good but the fact this happened at night with Pike kind of discounts that because doubtful those pike are eating (although it was a very bright night the second night, cannot remember the first).  Very strange sight for sure."
706925,whiskywizard,2012-06-18 18:50:00,305, Was he reading a navigation chart at the time?
706936,JoshS,2012-06-18 19:07:00,729,Just found this on youtube if you want to see it in action:  
706988,DundasSteelheader,2012-06-18 20:34:00,166," Was just going to say I have seen salmon do it many times in the fall, always thought it was a way to get their bearings but I guess i was wrong!"
707089,Fisherpete,2012-06-19 00:46:00,1814,"Saw it twice in one day last Sunday - my feeling is that is post-release stress related, as there were tons of boats fishing for skis near where I saw them. The first one, a mid 30's fish, surfaced for only a few seconds... the second was a bigger one and probably did this for a good 30 seconds or so before diving back down with a big tail splash.  Pete"
707163,Stoty,2012-06-19 04:19:00,2910,That makes great target practice for flipping a jig! Moving target!
707170,funfishing,2012-06-19 06:16:00,147," I think pike can eat at night so it's still possible, but I must say that, folks, the answer in this case is hidden in plain sight. We are witnessing the evolutionary spirit of our top underwater predator."
707175,chris.brock,2012-06-19 09:01:00,4053,"I don't think they have swim bladder problems, I've seen that with lakers and rockbass through the ice and the behaviour looks totally different  in the youtube video, the gills are being dragged along the surface, maybe they can take in more oxygen by doing this? or, having their eyes or nostrils out of the water for awhile somehow helps them, an itchy air bubble in the nostril? a little parasite on the eye?  good job finding that video JoshS"
707180,Roy,2012-06-19 09:40:00,13728,"Josh, watching that video, I'd say he's trying to get on plane."
707181,Terry,2012-06-19 09:41:00,14456,guess he needs trim tabs
707182,Roy,2012-06-19 09:44:00,13728, 
707274,backbay,2012-06-19 16:06:00,773," That was a pretty aggressive hook set, Roy!"
793614,chris.brock,2013-06-20 03:17:00,4053,"last week I had a pike gorf my 6"" stick bait and break me off, while walleye fishing  it came to the surface and swam with it's head above the water, it wasn't thrashing, just swimming  my cousin was able to snag it near the mouth, my bait was deep in it's gullet, 3 trebles hooked, we removed all 4 hooks, very little bleeding, and let it go  the pike obviously wanted whatever was in it's mouth out of there  this is evidence that this behaviour is because an esocid has eaten something too large or a spiny fish isn't sitting well in it's mouth"
793621,Toad Hunter,2013-06-20 06:53:00,261,"i have had quite a few aquariums over the years, and have seen many fish act some what the same as this, some more erratic than others.. but many just like this, after stress from a range different reasons.. so my vote (for as little as it's worth) - goes to the ""fish under stress and on its way out"" argument"
793716,Dabluz,2013-06-20 21:17:00,701,"I do a lot of fishing in places where there are a lot of pike and I have never seen a fish do this.  However, I must add that my fishing is done in unpolluted water."
793730,JoshS,2013-06-20 22:00:00,729,"Neat info Chris, makes sense."
706495,mike rousseau,2012-06-17 12:00:00,4661,Was fishing yesterday and saw what I thought was a muskrat or beaver... Until I looked closer... It was a pretty big pike swimming with its head out of the water!!!! Over 10 FOW... And I don't mean I coul see the top of its head... I could see tge whole head right to the gills... And it swam like this for about 100 feet...  I've never seen this before...  Has anyone else ever seen this?  Does anyone know why it was doing that?
706498,Grimace,2012-06-17 12:15:00,2020,"They are known to do that although I completely forget why.  This came up on the board a few years back, someone will know for sure."
706499,Roy,2012-06-17 12:15:00,13728,"Mike, it's a very common occurrence. In certain sections, the Larry is not crystal clear so some fish with failing eyesight (especially pike, carp and sturgeon) must stick their head out to get their bearings...see where they are going."
706501,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-17 12:16:00,535,"I've heard of that happening, never witnessed it myself. Some people think it might be because they just ate a big meal and are trying to swallow it, who knows? Definetly strange...."
706505,Grimace,2012-06-17 12:21:00,2020,Here is a thread from a couple years back.  Some of the guys suggest digestion in the thread but it isn't clear cut.  The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission website that Sinclair links suggest the same thing as Roy mentioned.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=44521&st=0
706507,bow slayer,2012-06-17 12:22:00,1074,"I seen a large musky doing this once and we watched it from a dock for a couple minutes. When it circled around close enough we noticed it had a large sucker in its mouth,actually most of it down his throat. After a another few minutes it dropped down out of site."
706510,Grimace,2012-06-17 12:31:00,2020,"I have a strange hypothesis.  Musky and pike like to bask in warm water after they get a belly full of food to help them digest.  If a Pike or Musky sucked back a big ole Sucker (like some of the eye witness accounts of fish in the Pike/Musky's mouths) and then went to shallow warm water to digest, maybe it would be possible that the predators swim bladder would be controlled but the dead Sucker's swim bladder being still intact would expand with the air as it comes into shallow water?  That would make for too much air for the predator fish to deal with at the front of the body thus bringing his head out of the water until he can swallow the fish back into his belly.  Once swallowed back into the centre of the body he could get that tail moving and those pectoral fins steering properly until the food would be digested enough to get rid of that extra air or move back to some deeper water.  I have no idea, it was just a thought."
706512,Roy,2012-06-17 12:36:00,13728,Good hypothesis Grimace. You'd make an excellent debate partner.
706513,NAW,2012-06-17 12:38:00,4022,"I've seen Gar do this several times, but never for 100'.  Only 5 or 10' at most."
706516,mike rousseau,2012-06-17 12:54:00,4661,Thanks guys... And thanks for the link grimace...  I've seen gar swimming with beaks out of the water... Bit not the entire head...  Choking down a meal sounds like it makes sense...  Very cool sight to see
706527,mercman,2012-06-17 13:15:00,7054,  Silly little man !!!!
706541,Gregoire,2012-06-17 14:09:00,1397,"This year I have been out twice, and seen a few musky breaking the water. I have not seen a fish with it's entire head out of the water yet. One of the common explanations, as has been suggested, is that the musky, for whatever reason, is gulping air. The suggestion that it is looking to fill it's air sac seems as likely as any other."
706543,Djeep,2012-06-17 14:18:00,199,"while doing some volunteer the ministry I saw a muskie released from a trap net swim like this for a while, possibly related to stress.  Ive also had a hooked pike swim around like this, which contributes to the food jammed in the throat theory."
706586,Pigeontroller,2012-06-17 16:31:00,2793,  I think you'd better check the colour of the leaves in your cigarettes!
706588,mike rousseau,2012-06-17 16:38:00,4661, According to this site...  http://www.fish.state.pa.us/images/pages/qa/fish/musky_odd.htm  ... He's right...  I thought he was kidding till I read the info in the link... Now I'm thinking there may be something to it... I see musky jumping all the time... And I don't mean busting the surface in an attack... I mean like clear the water by a few feet sometimes...
706597,kickingfrog,2012-06-17 16:58:00,8333,The myth thread is two down.
706606,Rich Nelson,2012-06-17 17:30:00,332,
706608,Rich Nelson,2012-06-17 17:31:00,332,Just because a website posts a theory ( that is Bull) doesnt make it true. Possibly one of the dumbest things Ive ever read! Ha ha
706615,Roy,2012-06-17 17:47:00,13728, 
706680,mike rousseau,2012-06-17 23:04:00,4661, I didn't say it was true...  I said according to the link someone else posted it was true...  And what the heck do I know about pike dancing across tge surface of the water...?  That's why I asked...
706682,Cudz,2012-06-17 23:10:00,2652,That is a very interesting hypothesis.  I have recently read an article that suggests fish eyes out of water work much like our eyes do underwater. Everything is very blurry.
706684,Garfisher,2012-06-17 23:14:00,229,The muskies when they do it in the hatchery its usually because they're stressed as hell (although i can see them doing it with food to use gravity to their advantage to help food slide down). Gar do it because they are breathing.
706748,chris.brock,2012-06-18 02:18:00,4053,"Yeah, I would a guess a fish can't see when out of water, I'm pretty sure that even if they could see well above the surface, they couldn't comprehend what they see above the surface and relate it to where they are ""oh, there's that yellow boathouse, I'll go see if there's any shiners hanging around there""  the researcher that proposed the theory Roy posted, is in the wrong occupation"
706797,beagle dad,2012-06-18 12:46:00,224,don't know why they do this seen it sat. with big musky  looked like he was eating flies off the surface..mouth wide open whole head and part of body out of water  
706807,bubbles,2012-06-18 13:23:00,591,"  If that was the case every fish would be swimming this way in the Detroit river, you can't see 6"" down most days."
