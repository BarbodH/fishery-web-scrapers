The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) is chumming provincial waters with an influx of new inhabitants. More than 1,200 lakes and rivers throughout the province will be restocked in an effort to maintain the fish population and provide a steady balance for anglers and natural ecosystems. MNR spokesman Wil Wegman told the Examiner the annual project introduces more than 8.5 million different species of fish into provincial waterways to ensure the population doesn’t slip to drastically low numbers. “Locally, MNR stocks 140,000 whitefish and 50,000 lake trout into Lake Simcoe every year. Additional, local stocking efforts also occur in Georgian Bay and the Muskoka Region,” he said. “MNR stocks fish primarily for two purposes.  One is to rehabilitate degraded fish populations with the intent of restoring naturally self-sustaining fish populations, and the other is to create, enhance or maintain fishing opportunities.” Species include aurora trout, brook trout, brown trout, splake, lake trout, lake whitefish, rainbow trout, walleye, muskellunge and Chinook salmon. The province manages 24% of Canada’s fresh water sources, including 40% of the Great Lakes and various rivers and streams to offset more than 1.3 million anglers who each spend an average of 16 days fishing in Ontario. “In addition to stocking up to 8.5 million fish annually, MNR facilities also maintain 17 captive brood stocks which it uses to meet most of its own egg requirements and also to provide between one to 1.5 million eggs to community hatcheries each year,” Wegman said. “A great deal, and although much of it is carried out by MNR, the efforts and contributions of many of our partners and stakeholders are important.” MNR partners with the Lake Simcoe Muskie Restoration Program, Muskies Canada, Fleming College Hatchery and MNR’s Blue Jay Creek Fish Culture Station, to help introduce fish based on population levels in multiple lakes and rivers throughout the province. “It’s an example of a program aimed at restoring self-sustaining populations through short-term, rehabilitative stocking,” Wegman said. “Rehabilitative stocking is particularly useful when traditional management options are ineffective. However, stocking can be ineffective, and sometimes even harmful, if done in the wrong situation.” The province dedicates approximately $5.5 million a year in fish culture and stocking activities involving nine fish culture stations where multiple species are raised each year before being released into waterways. “MNR monitors the effectiveness of fish stocking and other fisheries management activities through a variety of monitoring, assessment and research initiatives,” Wegman said. “These programs help to inform future stocking efforts, targets, and harvest regulations.” Fish populations are monitored for regularity, but Wegman said MNR staff reach out to anglers to analyse which species are popular. “A high percentage of what MNR stocks is based on angler preferences combined with habitat requirements,” he said. “Trout spawning habitat for instance may be lacking in even some remote northern Ontario lakes, yet the demand for trout fishing opportunities there are not diminished.” Fish are derived from eggs collected from 17 carefully managed brood stocks at MNR facilities which also includes eggs hatched from wild collections. “In Lake Simcoe, MNR uses only adult lake trout and whitefish,” Wegman said. “We have a trap netting program in the fall when both species are spawning. Its then that we collect eggs from the females, fertilize those eggs with ripe males and then deliver to the hatcheries to incubate.” Although Wegman can’t predict where fishing will be at it’s best, he did say local waterways usually boast plentiful stock and are known to anglers for their bountiful waters. “There are many excellent fishing opportunities within the Barrie area- beginning with our very own Lake Simcoe which supports one of the finest naturally reproducing yellow perch and smallmouth bass in all of North America,” Wegman said. “In addition, the lake also now supports a highly popular and valuable  Whitefish and Lake trout fishery thanks largely due to MNR’s efforts to rehabilitate these species.” [email protected] "
