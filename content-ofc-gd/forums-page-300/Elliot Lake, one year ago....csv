Found an interesting article on the history of this village:  [url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ERA1xcCCDUsC&pg=RA1-PT171&dq=Elliot+Lake+Real+Estate+and+Bob+Izumi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5cXFUefnKc-vqQGkq4CQAQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA]     the cap't"

I'm not so sure though Chris that nobody will be held accountable.  The inquiry that is being held is opening up A LOT of eyes around town.  The engineer that stamped the building safe a mere weeks prior to the collapse was charged and the lawyers are circling!  There may not be many held accountable criminally, but I suspect some will feel it in the wallet....city included.  Unfortunately, that means we too as innocent and misled citizens will also be held accountable.  Very Sad.  We will survive and hopefully be stronger for it!  Thanks for mentioning it Capt.  I think.
