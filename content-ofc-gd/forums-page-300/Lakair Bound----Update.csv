793463,motv8tr,2013-06-19 12:01:00,2587,"What a great day yesterday was!!! Headed out of here in the early hours and watch the sun rise as I went.  Just as the sun was starting brighten things up I looked to my left and down the slope at a pond or high water area spotted a deer having her morning drink.  Promising start to my day  I arrived at Lakair a little before 7am and was greeted heartily by Digger the camp dog…much to the dismay of those still sleeping I’m sure.  I spotted some movement to my right and there was Rich up at at ‘em, went over to say good morning and was treated to a fresh cup of coffee from Patsy, just what I needed.  We had a short visit before they headed into town to have their boat taken care of.  As they left, I took what was left of my coffee and headed down to the main dock to take a photo and revel in being there…ahhhh…I heard someone speaking, looked up and about two hundred feet away there was a Moose swimming across the channel…if I had a camera with a zoom I would have taken a shot, but as it was all I had was my phone so I just stood there and appreciated the site.  Coffee done, time to get the boat I arranged for and get out there.  I headed first to an area I had managed to catch a Walleye a few years ago, but this was not to be the morning for Walleye.  Moved the boat down a bit further, found a promising looking spot, settled in and on the third cast, Fish On!!, oh it felt good to have something other than weeds or pan fish on the line.   I managed to get it near the boat and spotted it before it managed to go under the boat, not huge, but respectable…and then the line broke    I pulled the line up, and realized I had forgotten to put a leader on  …dang…ok, no problem, there’s fish here, retie, with a leader this time and get at it….  Nothing happened for a bit, then I felt a little tug, had a small fish on, thought perch?  I got it to the boat, and it was a Pike that didn’t even qualify as a hammer handle…lol..still, it was a fish. Back it goes  and I continue on…nothing much happened for a while after that.  I hate leaving a place when I know there are fish around so I tried a few more presentations…nada…ok one last shot with my Red Devil (Daredevil), threw it out, and started reeling, when Fish On!!!   I love when they hit it hard.  I took my time,  reeled it in slowly, gave it some slack (was having problems with the drag), got it near the boat and  another respectable fish, before I could grab the net…the line broke…ahhh…  Lesson learned…check gear thoroughly before heading out, and always bring a second set up…which I usually do…not sure why I didn’t this time…  I peeled out 30-40 ft of line and started over…by this time no more bites for that area, time to move on, next spot…nothing…off I go..  Got to another promising looking area and only had about an hour or less before I had to head back in.  Was working the area for a bit, managed a couple of Perch, but decent sized ones, was thinking I’d play with them for a bit before I moved on.  Not long after my second perch the bite died completely…huh…I was going to pull out, then thought, maybe some Pike moved in???  Tried a couple of presentations to no avail, went back to what worked for my first one, and as I neared the boat with the retrieval a big splash and twirl in the water…dang that startled me…threw the lure back right away,ready this time, and sure enough he hit it good    This time I was very careful to make sure the drag was set properly, had the net at the ready, and before too long it was in the boat  Finally  I managed to get a measurement of 22”, not huge, but not too shabby…I was happy with it .  I didn’t have a live well or cooler or anything to bring it back for lunch with, so back it went for next time.  Unfortunately I don’t have a photo bucket account and am on dial up so no pictures available here….  I didn’t get a chance to see Joey and Paul as they were still asleep when I arrived and out on their boat when I came back in.  I will go back again in July for a day and hopefully see them then…  Maureen"
793464,Joey,2013-06-19 12:48:00,9122,"Sorry we missed you Maureen. We were up just a little after you arrived apparently, but since our boat is at the little docs and not the main docks, I guess that is how we missed seeing you.  Glad you at least caught some fish!!"
793523,Rich Clemens,2013-06-19 17:26:00,3131,Good to see you made it through the blasting zone and back home again safely - and to catch up with you for a little while.  Something about weeds in the water pump wasn't making the motor very happy - go figure.   Finally boated a ski this morning.  Not much action today other than that - couple small pie.   Seems to be a tough bite today.   Well hit the west bay again this evening.
793536,Big Cliff,2013-06-19 18:07:00,6899,"Nice report Moe, glad to hear you got up there and got out and had a bit of action to boot. Wish I could have been there with you. !"
793556,motv8tr,2013-06-19 20:13:00,2587,"Rich, glad to hear you finally got your Muskie...I know there a few more out there...and stay out of the weeds  Cliff, it would have been great to have shared the boat with you..."
793690,capt_hooked,2013-06-20 17:35:00,212,"Hi Maureen... sorry we missed you.. but will be around for your next visit...  The moose story was exciting..  best,  the cap't  ...  "
