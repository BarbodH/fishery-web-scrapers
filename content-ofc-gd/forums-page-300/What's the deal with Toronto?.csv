793781,PitViper,2013-06-21 04:20:00,33,"A couple months back, an episode of real fishing aired and Bob was fishing just off of downtown T.o for pike, can we shore fish for pike down there or not? I was reading a lot of stuff that says it is illegal. Why would it be so? Or is it so"
793782,John Bacon,2013-06-21 04:25:00,3277,I think the city put up some no fishing signs a while back but too them down after the public out cry.  There are places to shore fish; there may be some places that are off limits.
793800,craigdritchie,2013-06-21 11:12:00,1586,Be aware that some of the stuff on TV these days is pretty old. Some of these shows syndicate for several years after they were taped.
793808,Lape0019,2013-06-21 12:35:00,647,"Yeah,  Easy way to figure it out with that show is to see if Bob is wearing columbia gear or fishing with Shimano equipment. If he is, it is old."
793821,chris_robinson,2013-06-21 14:02:00,14,"Any public lands where there is public access along the shoreline should be fine now, both Toronto and Toronto Port Authority properties (trespassing past fences/gates is still trespassing however - this mainly applies to TPA).  If you're shore fishing in the middle of some other organized event where there's a large crowd, you might be asked to move, and they don't want anyone fishing in amongst the marinas.  Ontario Place is still an unknown, no representative attended the fishing summit last month.  The above applies to shore fishing, the TPA still requires another boating licence to be inside the Harbour; fishing from a boat is fine though, other than the East and West Gaps and near beaches with swimmers.  This staff report has the explicit list of park locations:  http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2013/pe/bgrd/backgroundfile-54760.pdf  There will be a public meeting in October in Toronto to get stakeholder input on an urban recreational fishing plan for the waterfront from the east end of Durham to the west end of Mississauga (CLOCA, TRCA, CVC jurisdictions).  For information on this plan and other Toronto fishing issues, I'd suggest checking out the Toronto Urban Fishing Ambassadors site:  http://torontourbanfishing.com/  There was also this announcement the other day:  http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/06/18/tommy_thompson_park_restoration_will_benefit_fish_mammals_birds_and_us.html  Chris Robinson OFAH"
793832,woodenboater,2013-06-21 15:12:00,2277,I believe the inner harbour license is for powered craft. Canoes will/should be fine. Just stay out of the markers near the island airport if canoeing.  Also take note of the eight paragraph in this Globe story and first specie mentioned.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/of-wetlands-and-waterfronts/article12661056/#dashboard/follows/
793841,JoshS,2013-06-21 16:57:00,729,"That was a recent show. Go give it a shot. If you get kicked out your most likely in a marina or private property other than that it's fairly open down there from shore.  The islands are a good place to start... lots of places to cast from shore for bass, carp and pike."
