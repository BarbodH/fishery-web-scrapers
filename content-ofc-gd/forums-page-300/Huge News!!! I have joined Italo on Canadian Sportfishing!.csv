791401,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-09 11:52:00,2690,"Congrats Aaron, fresh blood will be good for the show. Enjoy!!"
791567,Tim Mills,2013-06-10 01:54:00,476,Your old show was good especially the upper niagara musky espisode.  I like the fact that italo fishes local spots that I have fished.   Looking forward to what you will bring to the show. Congrats
791684,Mike Pike,2013-06-10 16:06:00,1332,"Terrific news for you Aaron.  I always enjoyed your early shows with Barry, and will no doubt enjoy your work on such a high profile program.  Break a leg!  ( That's good luck in show biz )"
792266,Christopheraaron,2013-06-12 18:54:00,3525,"Canadian sportfishing is playing in the background, please start filming!"
792276,jimmer,2013-06-12 19:52:00,2730,"Congrats! Hope it's what you want. You don't know me from Adam, but I'm available for a guest spot anytime! lol No Seriously."
792304,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-12 22:15:00,8243, A what will get better? Get better for sure.  Aaron will you be a regular or is this some guest appearances?
792559,LeXXington,2013-06-14 14:35:00,1928,congrats
792695,ketchenany,2013-06-15 20:30:00,3229,I was at an Ontario tourism function last week and it featured a fishing simulator associated with gofishinontario (ausome) and there was Canadian Sportfishing jacket on display I guess you guys are associated with them. Glad to have you guys on board with us tourism gang.
792752,Aaron Shirley,2013-06-16 03:06:00,655,"Old Ironmaker, I will be on the show on a regular basis part time. This works well, as I work full time and have two young kids that keep me very busy! I hope to take them fishing tomorrow on Father's Day if the weather cooperates"
792780,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-16 06:32:00,8243,"I can't wait to see what you've done. Another guy on the tube on Saturday mornings I can yell to my wife, "" Look, look, I know that guy!!!!"" and she will say "" sort of right?""."
793166,wildeye rainbow,2013-06-17 22:40:00,123,Congrats Aaron.  Looking forward to seeing you again on the tube.  WR
793524,srg,2013-06-19 17:31:00,1,congrats Aaron!  looking fwd to the next season of Canadian Sportfishing!
793691,Fishandchips,2013-06-20 17:43:00,72,"Congrats,that is great news,maybe you will be able to take over when he retires,at least now we will be able to see someone other than his wife on the shows."
790860,ehg,2013-06-06 15:50:00,2666,Congrats! Look forward to the episodes. Hopefully there will be some coverage of the good fishing in southern Ontario.
790867,porkpie,2013-06-06 16:08:00,2521,I like what you have done so far.  I am sorry to hear you have chosen to partner with Italo.
790875,Headhunter,2013-06-06 16:46:00,5703,"Congrats to you! I can see this partnership benefiting both parties... Italo gets a fisheman who is much more in tune with the average fisherman, who could also, likely add some ""life"" to his show. You get access to Italo's vast resources within the industry. A win win as far as I can tell. But I just can't wait until I hear Italo say ""look at the colours Aaron""! Good fortune to the both of you! HH"
790891,msp,2013-06-06 18:04:00,1336,Well done Aaron. No doubt this will bring new viewers to the show
