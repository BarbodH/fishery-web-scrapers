793857,mike rousseau,2013-06-21 18:35:00,4661,It was either $18 or $28 in rockland....  Couldn't believe it...  I have 2 free boat launches within minutes of my house.... Love it... And surprisingly... They aren't as busy as the pay ones... Lol
793815,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-21 13:22:00,10439,When they raised it to $30 I would have said see ya!!! Anything more than $15 for launch and park is too much. IMHO  Most of the lakes I launch on here are FREE!!!! The ones you have to pay for are in Territorial parks and are cheap. The one lake I fish where I launch and park inside the park is $30 . . . . . . . . . . . FOR THE SEASON!!!!!!!! May to September The rest of the year is free. Double concrete ramp with large docks and plenty of parking.
793816,NAW,2013-06-21 13:41:00,4022,Wow..  That's brutal.  Who knows the entire story though..  They may be about to go teats up.. Grabbing a straws to pay the bills..?  How much is a parking ticket?  Not Likely more than $45....
793817,ccmtcanada,2013-06-21 13:47:00,7971,Or perhaps the local cottage association has a deal with them....all their repairs and boating needs bought through them and in return they try to inhibit boat traffic on the lake...
