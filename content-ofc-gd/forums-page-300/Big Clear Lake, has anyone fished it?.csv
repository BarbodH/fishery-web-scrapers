The cottage is on Big Clear Lake in the small town of Arden in Frontenac county. I have never did much serious fishing on the lake but have had good luck with bass every year along with the odd pike and nice sized pan fish. There is also Walleye in this lake but never had much luck, my father has in past years but it has also slowed down for him also.  I know I am new here, but am not asking for any specific hot spots. Has anyone ever fished this lake? and if so any tips or suggestions you may have as I have not done much fishing but plan on putting in a lot of hours this coming week!  A report will come following my trip with pictures! I also look forward to posting some reports on some local k-w spots this summer!   Cheers Gimbz"
