793864,d_paluch,2013-06-21 19:34:00,343,"Hey guys!  Looking to find a spot in the southern part of cooks bay where I can 'launch' my portaboat.  Launch is emphasized because all I really need is water access and a small bit of flat land beside it where I can put it together. I would prefer not to pay to launch, but am willing to pay a small fee to park my car, but obviously free is preferred.  My plan is for the girlfriend and I to hit up some LM/SM bass and maybe some pike.  Any input is welcomed!"
793866,Terry,2013-06-21 19:46:00,14456,"you can do it at  the bottom of 89 west side of cooks, lots of parking around the corner  or keswick lakeshore just north of ravenshoe  two spots, both have crappy ramps and both have parking  south spot just  cars  at Sherlea blvd and north spot vehicles and trailers at Walter drive"

793914,porkpie,2013-06-22 02:10:00,2521,"Walter street launch, foot of Walter in keswick, takes you in on the east shore, in the marsh where your relatively protected!"
793984,d_paluch,2013-06-22 20:34:00,343,"Thanks a lot guys!  Had a decent day out there, the wind was a pain for my little boat, and I think I need to get a real anchor and not use a 10lb barbell weight  I caught 7 and my girlfriend caught 4. Nothing too big until we decided to fish the shoreline to avoid the wind.  Ended up landing this guy, put up a great fight  "
