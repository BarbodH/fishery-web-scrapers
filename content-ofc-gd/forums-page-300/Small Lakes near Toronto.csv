793142,ccmtcanada,2013-06-17 20:42:00,7971,"What's ""near"" for you?  How long a car ride?   Are you east or west end in the city?  Assuming panfish is what you are looking for?"
793215,Shloim,2013-06-18 01:17:00,515,"No my kid can fish, im looking for bass or pike and around an hour from the city. We are centrally located in the city near the 401"
793222,Ben_Daniels,2013-06-18 01:42:00,435,"Most people will be pretty hesitant to share the location of small ponds around the city that hold bass and pike, the toronto islands and harbor are a good bet for both though."
793223,ccmtcanada,2013-06-18 01:45:00,7971,"Do you have a boat or is this shore fishing? If its shore pike you are looking for then I'd start at the Toronto Islands.  If you have a boat, then I'd suggest Lake Scugog for bass.  No pike there but bass, walleye and muskies roam those waters."
793235,Shloim,2013-06-18 02:08:00,515,"We have a fishing canoe with a trolling motor and outriggers. Pretty stable on calm waters, can stand in it and land fish"
793236,BillM,2013-06-18 02:09:00,17367,Sounds like you should give Scugog a try.
793262,adempsey,2013-06-18 04:11:00,1498,Maybe Island Lake?  http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/enjoy-the-outdoors/conservation-areas/island-lake-conservation-area/
793493,Shloim,2013-06-19 15:59:00,515,"So, from what ive been told Scugog is kind if nig for a canoe... Now if you had to choose between Kelso, Mountsberg of Guelph ? Which would you choose?"
793501,Sinker,2013-06-19 16:29:00,8692,"You'll be fine in the back bays of scugog in a canoe. When I was a kid, that's all we had, and we fished scugog a lot out of it. Launch off the causeway on the east side of the island and have atter.  S."
