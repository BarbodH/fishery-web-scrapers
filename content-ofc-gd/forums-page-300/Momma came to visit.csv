793668,lew,2013-06-20 15:16:00,12766,A few of the neighbors around here put their garbage out days before pick-up and it always leads to bears coming out for a free feast. After they finished stuffing themselves last night they took a short-cut across my front lawn to get back into the woods. Big tracks on the left will be Momma and the little ones on the right will be a cub

793687,lew,2013-06-20 17:10:00,12766,Well it certainly wasn't my little pooch  
793695,porkpie,2013-06-20 18:20:00,2521,I'd be having words with those neighbours if I where you!  That's plain ignorant!
793709,lew,2013-06-20 20:34:00,12766,They have been spoken to...many times...but they still don't get it.  But they'll probably be the 1st to want the bears killed when something serious happens.
793734,motv8tr,2013-06-20 22:40:00,2587,That's a little too close for comfort...especially with a cub...hope nothing serious happens...  Maureen
