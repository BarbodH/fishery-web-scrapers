794079,Ainsley,2013-06-23 02:49:00,142,Very nice choice!
794083,Bass Tard,2013-06-23 03:26:00,128,"Nothing too offshore about a Matrix, I've made a few of  them.  Thanks for helping a fellow OFC'r!"
793994,Rustic-Fisher,2013-06-22 21:52:00,826,"Great thread, just so happens we were also looking for a vehicle . After doing some extra homework we've decided on a Subaru forester and pick it up on Tuesday. Thanks OFC"
793996,Ainsley,2013-06-22 22:00:00,142,"Ryan, what year forester are you picking up?"
794002,Rustic-Fisher,2013-06-22 22:30:00,826,09 Forester XT. Low KMs and scored a pretty sweet deal from the Subaru dealership ( believe it or not LOL)
794033,Sinker,2013-06-23 00:54:00,8692,Oh ya.....your gonna like the XT! Congrats!  S.
793092,Big Cliff,2013-06-17 17:17:00,6899,"Just curious? You started with an 08 but now have an 07? If I may ask, why the change?  2009 Forester and on are the re-desigined modles and have the better gas milage (and a bunch of other things). I have been looking for a good 2009 or newer, they are really hard to find and when you do, you are still looking at $18 - 19 thou for anything good + taxes. When I can get a 2013 Elantra for the same money (and I realize we are not compairing apples to apples here) I really am having a hard time trying to decide which way to go. I wouldn't mind a manual but Sue really would prefer an automatic. It is a really big investment for us especially now that I am semi retired."
793103,frozen-fire,2013-06-17 17:47:00,542," I wanted the power from the turbo version. Wasn't too keen on getting a newer wrx (08+) due to price and how they looked. I much prefered the GD chassis (02-07) and body style. Plus saved some money going back a year.  Here's my car as she sits now:   I find I'm getting older and not too into the fast car craze anymore. So I have been in and out of looking for a used forester. I was ready to let my WRX go (actually to a member on this forum), but decided I would keep it for a little while longer.  My very first car was a mitsubishi, then I got a civic...and finally went AWD with subaru and haven't looked back.  I came really close to getting an 06 Forester XT - auto. It had just over 100k km on it. Really clean car and was well maintained. Wanted to think it through and it got sold before I could decide. I kind of regret not jumping on that one. On one hand, I really wanted a 5spd because it's what I'm used to and it's a lot more fun to drive. But my better half would much prefer an auto so she could drive it as well."
793107,Big Cliff,2013-06-17 18:08:00,6899,"Wow, that is a nice looking car!!!!! I'm afraid I won't be getting anything like that, I'm well past the ""mid-life crises"" thing besides I'd probably never be able to get out of it LOL.. I just went into town to get a few things, wouldn't you know it, blew a brake line, Subaru is back in the shop again. I just figured it out and in the past month it has been costing me about $1.00/km to drive. Anyone want a good deal on an almost rebuilt Subaru LOL. (just kidding I wouldn't sell it, it is time for it to go bye bye. Makes me think of that Johnny Cash song One piece at a time!"
793109,Ainsley,2013-06-17 18:28:00,142,Not to drag the thread off topic but those 06-08 forester XTs are very nice.  I would have loved to pick one up but they were way out of my budget.
793114,Sinker,2013-06-17 18:47:00,8692,"Ainsley, is your forester an XT?  Mines an auto, but lots of people have offered to buy it from me. I'm driving it to the ground, then will likely get another.  S."
793115,Ainsley,2013-06-17 18:49:00,142,"I wish I could have gotten an XT, mine is just the XS."
793117,Sinker,2013-06-17 18:51:00,8692,"Sweet ride Frozen-fire. I almost had the same one, but the forester suits my needs much better. I just couldn't see the WRX towing my 16ft boat very far lol.  The XT doesn't even know its on there, but she burns a lot more fuel towing!  S."
793133,davey buoy,2013-06-17 19:36:00,5505,"Maybe I will look at a forester next,my 99 explorer Sport may not be the best on gas,but 432,000km on the dial and runs from 220-300km's a day.No sign of it dying any time soon,but loving this thread.Good luck Cliff,wondering if a forester would pull a 3000lb boat?I'm not sure?,but the gas saving on a daily commute may be worth looking into!!"
793157,Sinker,2013-06-17 22:08:00,8692,I wouldn't tow a 3000lb boat around too far/often with a forester. My whole rig is maaaybe 1200lbs fully loaded. It handles that no problem.  S.
793170,bronzeback,2013-06-17 22:56:00,30,"Both my daughters just bought new Elantra sedans and love them.  A lot of car for the money.  As far as I know, the sedans are built in Montgomery Alabama while the coupes and GT are built in Korea."
792896,SlowPoke,2013-06-16 22:19:00,2984,"""Support your own"" is always my first choice but when it comes to a big ticket item like a car, I support me first. In my opinion, the Elantra is unmatched for style, service and quality in its price range. I think you're also underestimating the number of quality jobs a dealership supports. Also, it won't be long before Hyundai starts building in North America and hopefully turning the lights on in some vacant plants and employing displaced workers. It's brands like Hyundai, Toyota and Honda that put the big three where they were a few years ago and forced them to step up their made in North America quality. Competition is a good thing and consumers will benefit from it. Toyota has done a world of good for Woodstock and the local feeder plants. I'm okay with attracting foreign investment in Canadian jobs. Ford on the other hand has hurt a lot of local industry by closing the Talbotville plant. Just so you know, I always check for COO (country of origin) when I am purchasing something. If I can get the same or better quality made in North America, I'm willing to shell out a few extra bucks. I don't think I'll be changing your opinion but I wanted to expand on my thoughts."
792904,Sinker,2013-06-16 23:10:00,8692,"Maybe so, but your not getting much for $141/mo, or your putting out A large downpayment.  Your also not getting the versitality of the subaru forster. Just wait till the snow flies, or you need to get up a slippery hill......you'll be missing the forester. What about when you kill your deer this fall? Gonna throw it in the back of the soul? Have to tow your trialer around?  I'm a bit biased, my forester has been awesome, and if/when it dies, I'm getting another one. At 270K it owes me nothing. S."
792905,Big Cliff,2013-06-16 23:14:00,6899,"Thanks guys, I would love to be able to afford a new Forester but I can't justify spending that much. I did look at Honda, Toyota, and Ford, wouldn't touch a GM if you gave it to me after having a really bad experience with their lack of customer service. I told them then that I wouldn't ever buy one of their products again.  As for keeping this old girl alive, it needs front end work, a new sensor, parking brake just quit working and the exhaust system is starting to get a little loud. The power steering lines will have to be replaced one day soon, the cruse control has quit working and high speed on the blower fan no longer works. I am concerned that if the transmission or engine do decide to fail I'll have so much money invested in it that I'd end up having to sink even more ito it. Got to draw the line somewhere.  I can buy a brand new Elantra CT for $306.00 a month with nothing down at zero% financing. With the amount of driving I am doing right now I expect to see a minimum 30% reduction just in my fuel costs which will save me over $100.00 a month. Still got some thinking to do though, it is a big investment for us."
792908,Sinker,2013-06-16 23:17:00,8692,I'm really surprised to hear you've had that many issues with your forester. Wow......  S.
792911,Big Cliff,2013-06-16 23:21:00,6899,"I do love the Forester, no question about it but it starts at about @ $26,000.00 and goes up quite quickly from there. What year is your Forester Sinker?"
792913,lew,2013-06-16 23:25:00,12766,"Don't try to justify it Cliff, just go ahead and buy it, you work hard and deserve it. I buy a new truck every 3 or 4 years and it's a great feeling being behind the wheel of a nice new vehicle.  Plus the fact it's under warranty and you don't have the worries associated with an old car."
792917,Sinker,2013-06-16 23:35:00,8692,"Mine is an '04, and its also a turbo.  I haven't had many issues. Did some front end work at about 200k ($1200), and just replaced a wheel bearing($200). Other than that just brakes, tires, and oil changes.  It will probably blow up on me now tho......lol   S."
