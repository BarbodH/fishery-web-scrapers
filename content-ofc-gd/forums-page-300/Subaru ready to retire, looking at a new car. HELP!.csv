794079,Ainsley,2013-06-23 02:49:00,142,Very nice choice!
794083,Bass Tard,2013-06-23 03:26:00,128,"Nothing too offshore about a Matrix, I've made a few of  them.  Thanks for helping a fellow OFC'r!"
793350,Big Cliff,2013-06-18 19:40:00,6899,"Well, a new item thrown into the mix. Sue test drove a Toyoto Martix today and a Hyundai Elantra. She liked the Matrix better. Price wise they were almost identical, the Elantra had more bells and whistles or so it seemed but she prefered the Matrix just for the feel of it and perhaps even the seaming simplicity. It has everything we wanted; air, cruse, automatic without a steering wheel full of buttons and I am told it is rated for towing 1500 lbs. The Elantra only 1000 lbs.  (I rarely have to tow anything but I do like to trailer my ATV once in a while) the Elantra on the other hand seemed more like a luxery car, it had all the same bells and whistles but they were all flashy and illuminated. Both offered zero down and zero financing Elantra had a 5 year warrenty, Toyata was only 3 years, both offered road side assistance. Resale value on both seemed to be about the same, we looked at a couple of 2010s in both and they were both in the $15,000.00 range.  When I talked to the Toyota dealer about snow tires he immediatly offered me a discount of almost $500.00 toward the snow tires and the first 4 oil changes free, (he wouldn't throw the snow tires on rims in for free) Hyundai wouldn't budge.  The Toyota included floor mats, the Hyundai were extra.  So we spent a good part of the day going over all the reviews, going back for second looks, and finally decided it was going to be the Toyota.  Now here is where I really got impressed! Within 10 minutes of telling the Toyota dealer whe wanted to buy the Matrix, the paper work was done, our loan (if you will) was approved, our insurance company had been notified on our behalf and the insurance all arranged and there was a temporary insurance slip waiting on my computer for me by the time I got home. I pick up the Toyata tomorrow morning at 9:00 am. No hassle, no pressure, no bull, no trying to up sell us (but we did purchase the 6 year 200,000 km bumper to bumper warranty including road side assistance) for piece of mind. Just good honest people with fantastic service and we are looking forward to owning our first ever Toyota.  BTW, when we went into KIA the salesman wanted a copy of our drivers license and insisted on going with us for the test drive, kind of made me feel like he didn't trust me which made me not comfortable with him hense Kia fell out of contention very quickly.  Thanks for all the help and opinions, you guys are awesome!"
793358,misfish,2013-06-18 20:09:00,29133, It gets him to the rivers fast Shane.LOL
793362,woodenboater,2013-06-18 21:46:00,2277,"There you go, first impressions make or break deals. Sounds like the makings of a good relationship with the dealership ! Enjoy the new ride and don't forget we love photos"
793367,aplumma,2013-06-18 22:20:00,6896,Good to hear Cliff I am sure you both will be happy with your new Toyota.   Art
793368,misfish,2013-06-18 22:22:00,29133,Nice Cliff.  Enjoy.  Built in North America.
793375,Sinker,2013-06-18 23:25:00,8692,I'm so glad you didn't get a kia!!  Nothing wrong with the Matrix. I'm sure it will serve you well for many years.  S.
793377,captpierre,2013-06-18 23:56:00,2521,Nice.  I believe the Matrix has the Corolla powertrain.  Bulletproof.  The hatch is handy for sure
793467,outllaw,2013-06-19 12:55:00,1232,I would not even concern with an offshore adventure. I would purchase a north amerian vehicle. oh well im old school. imports are not allowed on my property....period.
793471,Sinker,2013-06-19 13:23:00,8692,"Maybe if north american vehicles had something comparable that would last, I would agree. No bang for my buck with the big 3 as far as I'm concerned. No resale,  no reliability....where do you get your value?  S."
793485,motv8tr,2013-06-19 15:23:00,2587,"Very nice Cliff, I've heard good things about the matrix, I'm sure you'll both enjoy it. I will say the dealership I bought my Kia was not great in the customer service dept. I decided not to worry too much about it...I take my car elsewhere for service...look forward to seeing the new ride  Maureen"
793496,Big Cliff,2013-06-19 16:16:00,6899,"Well, it just keeps getting better! I went in this morning to pick up our new ride.  Got introduced to the service team, they set up my cell phone for me on the blue tooth, spent 1/2 an hour going over everything on the car with me aranged to get me steel rims that would fit the 15"" snow tires I had just bought last year for the Subaru so I wouldn't have to buy new snow tires this year and then, to top it all off, GAVE me a trailer hitch (used and pulled off a 2009 trade-in and I'll have to get the wiring done but just saved me another couple of hundred bucks) . I don't know if every Toyota dealership is as good as these guys but they take customer service to a whole new level. As far as being made in NA. This is made in Alliston ON (CANADA) for those of you that don't know.  Also, I bought a Chev a number of years back and the car and the customer service were both the worst thing I had ever encountered. I told them then I would never buy another Chev product again! Oh and outlaw, around here we we don't discriminate, you can drive anything you want on to our property, if it is a big three product we'll even help you tow it off!"
793497,Sinker,2013-06-19 16:22:00,8692,"Lol......  Glad to hear your getting the treatment you deserve, Cliff. I've had nothing but trouble with the big 3, and also with Kia.  S."
793498,FloatnFly,2013-06-19 16:26:00,1640,  theres a difference between built in NA and assembled in NA.  gauruntee your parts were made off shore
793500,crappieperchhunter,2013-06-19 16:28:00,2582,Cliff you mentioned it has a 1500LB towing capacity. I just checked the specs on the Toyota website. The basic Matrix is NOT rated for towing at all. But the XRS and the AWD are rated for 1500 as you mentioned.  You might wanna look into it further in case you have warranty issues down the road.
793509,Rod Caster,2013-06-19 16:45:00,5784,"yessir!  I got the 160 000 extended with my 09' Corolla and I've only had to use it once for an alternator issue which never caused any other problems. I'm at 150, 000 kms and the car still drives like new. Just love that car and I trust all the dealerships I've used. On the other hand my mazda truck is falling apart and is two years newer...mind you I don't take the corolla off-roading nearly as much."
793515,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-19 17:03:00,8243," Big Cliff,  You have made a good choice. My father bought a Camry new in 2009. 1 year or so and 7000 K after purchase his Dr. took his license from him for medical reasons. The dealership took back the car and gave him 90% of the total purchase price. That really impressed us as I really thought he was going to take a huge hit. The salesman showed me a list of customers looking for a near new Toyota, the car was sold before the paper work was done that tells a lot about a Toyota. I suggested he show that list to potential customers buying new. He has been and sent me Jays tickets as a thank you.  Congrats and good driving."
793520,Big Cliff,2013-06-19 17:21:00,6899,"No problem my friend, ours is the XRS"
793525,crappieperchhunter,2013-06-19 17:35:00,2582,Happy to hear that Cliff  My heart sank a little bit when I checked the website.
793531,Big Cliff,2013-06-19 17:53:00,6899,"This has to be the most informative sight on the internet! No matter what the topic I can always count on honest opinions, information, and advice (well except when it comes to fishing LOL).  Thank you one and all for always giving me help with what I am sure to many of you are no brainers but to some of us older guys seem like a real challange. To many of you a new car purchase isn't a big thing. To some of us it is a lifetime commitment.  You guys/gals are the best!"
793545,Rod Caster,2013-06-19 18:55:00,5784,Sweet. I got the XRS too....wanna race? I bet it'll be a tie
793669,cityfisher,2013-06-20 15:17:00,959," I got a 2013 Subaru Forestor back in Jan.  Great ride, getting 9l/100 on mostly hwy driving.  I used to have a WRX in 2004-2007... Great cars!"
793994,Rustic-Fisher,2013-06-22 21:52:00,826,"Great thread, just so happens we were also looking for a vehicle . After doing some extra homework we've decided on a Subaru forester and pick it up on Tuesday. Thanks OFC"
793996,Ainsley,2013-06-22 22:00:00,142,"Ryan, what year forester are you picking up?"
794002,Rustic-Fisher,2013-06-22 22:30:00,826,09 Forester XT. Low KMs and scored a pretty sweet deal from the Subaru dealership ( believe it or not LOL)
794033,Sinker,2013-06-23 00:54:00,8692,Oh ya.....your gonna like the XT! Congrats!  S.
792920,FloatnFly,2013-06-16 23:46:00,1640,"yea, don't try to justify it, , go for it, you need a reliable vehicle, that isn't hurting your wallet in repairs.  going to a 2012 or even 2011, would drastically reduce your purchase cost, not to mention insurance premiums on depreciation value on a 2013.  get what YOU WANT. test drive em all, see what feels right."
792922,porkpie,2013-06-17 00:00:00,2521,"  I agree with the above statement.  I commute 100KM each way when I'm on shift.  I drive a 98 civic.  While we have a late model pickup in the driveway, we also have a late model truck payment that goes with it.  I will drive my little civic into the ground!  It is great on gas, relatively cheap to fix, and the damn thing is extremely reliable.  I don't have to put a whole pile of money into it each year either.  My father in law drove his last subaru to 350K before the head gasket went on him, and he decided to replace instead of fix.  Your forester at 220k is just nicely broken in!"
792928,danc,2013-06-17 00:27:00,4677,"Exactly. I wouldnt buy new even if I won the lottery. I don't know who buys new vehicles these days. Certainly not anyone that I know of. The last vehicle that I bought was a 2006 Ford Five Hundred. That was 4 years ago. It had the window sticker with it that lists the price and options when it was new on the lot. $34000.00 plus tax. I paid $9000.00 with no tax with 80,000 kms on it. Just slightly broken in. You guys keep buying them new and I'll buy them a few years later at 1/4 of the cost."
792954,northernpike56,2013-06-17 01:10:00,717,"^ my dad bought his 335i about 6 months old, for appx 2/3 of the price that you would pay for a brand new one. Buy one very slightly used, because as soon as you drive a new car off the lot, it's going to drop down to appx 3/4 value of what you paid for it."
792968,cram,2013-06-17 01:25:00,1733,"Those Elantras are nice Cliff.  Great value.As others have said, I'm a big fan of Foresters as well.   You might get a deal on a '12 now that they have released the new version.  I think it's basically the same car with the new having nicer trim and a CVT transmission. As for north American jobs - Honda and Toyota have been generating more of those than the big 3.  "
792972,Ainsley,2013-06-17 01:28:00,142,What is your budget? Would you consider buying used? An older forester to suit your price range would be a great investment.
792985,bigbuck,2013-06-17 01:59:00,2449,"Cliff, a new car will cost you 3-4 thousand a year in depreciation plus whatever goes wrong along the way. If you spend 2 k a year on hour subaru, you are making money. The drivetrain has at least another hundred k in it. Drive it right down into the ground then replace it. I have spent enough money on cars in the past 25 years that I could have bought another small house. I plan on driving old cars in decent shape for the next 10-15 years. A car is a car is a car is a car.......... Ultimately though, whatever floats your boat. Btw, find out what the prob is with the blower and then hit the wreckers, you will find it."
792988,danc,2013-06-17 02:10:00,4677,"What I like most about my vehicles is that when you turn the key, they start. Then, when I pull that lever thing down to the D position, I can drive anywhere that I want to. And that's all that matters to me."
793013,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-17 04:54:00,8243,"The first new vehicle I ever bought was my Silverado in 2011, probably an impulse buy on the way home from the Oncologists with not great news. I'm looking at them at Haldimand motors now with slightly more K's and based on what I paid after all the PDI, etc etc. I want to cry. I have always bought slightly used and not regretted it. Do the math, next time around if there is a next time it will be slightly used again.  The most impressive vehicle I have ever owned is the 07 Nissan Altima my wife is driving. And I have owned them all, from Jags, Benz's, Caddies, BMW to Pontiacs. Bought it in June 08 with 29000K's, so about 16 months new. What a tank, and it flies with the 300 hp 3.5 L. Basic maintenance and that's it. Never had a mechanical problem, ever. Now has 240000 K and it looks new. We live on the north shore of Erie and she commutes down these poorly plowed country roads, with real winter snow tires it's the energizer bunny. If considering a Altima you must get the 3.5L engine. 8.5 L/100 K averaging 60K per hour. Please take one for a drive.  With all the extended warranties today a year old car will have 4 to 6 years left on the factory warranty. Just make sure it was never a fleet lease or rental.  A Kia Soul? My 83 year old next door neighbours bought one last fall, she thinks it's so cute. Like a steelworker driving a Miata, Soul, Na Cliff don't do it, you will lose the Big in Big Cliff."
793014,Big Cliff,2013-06-17 07:35:00,6899,"I think that is where the big difference lies Sinker, 6 years ago, heck even a year ago this thing was a rock but just in the past year every time I go anywhere something else seems to go wrong. I got it used so I have no idea how it was taken care of prior to my getting it.  There has been some really great feedback here and it will go a long way toward helping me make a decision. I am going to take Sue out Tuesday and let her test drive a couple of cars to see what she thinks then I'll do whatever she tells me."
793025,motv8tr,2013-06-17 11:16:00,2587,"Cliff, i don't have either car but I do have a Kia, (who is owned by Hyundai) and I would buy another one in a heart beat.  I have 490,000 km,, plus on my car.  I am starting to have to have a few things done now, but I am hard on my car and this is the first one to ever last me this long...up to now though, just basics, brakes, etc...well I did have to get the front control arm/ball joints done, but then, I am hard on my car and it had over  400,000 km at the time  From what I know you can't go wrong with either car, it comes down to your own preference for look, style and comfort..  Look forward to hearing what you choose, and seeing the new one...  Maureen"
793035,FloatnFly,2013-06-17 12:06:00,1640,"also, keep in mind about size, i don't how big a guy you are, but myself, im 6'4, and i don't fit in quite a few cars, since car makers have this vision of short people sitting in and driving their vehicles, even in my pontiacs, had a grand am and grand prix, i had to have the seats back so far i could look out the rear passenger window"
793039,hotsky,2013-06-17 12:25:00,400,"How about Mazda 3? Good on gas, sporty and has great handling. I have an '05 sadan and would get another one, been looking at hachback models lately...."
793077,frozen-fire,2013-06-17 16:01:00,542,"I will likely stick with Subaru for life. Been driving one for about 4 years now. Started with an 08 Impreza 2.5i. Currently driving an 07 WRX sedan. Absolutely love the thing. Especially when it snows  My next car will be an 06-08 forester XT for the extra cargo space. It's so hard finding a 5 speed manual these days. To me, it's the perfect fishing vehicle with a nice balance of power and space.  I would recommend to seriously consider looking for a used forester."
793086,doubleheader,2013-06-17 16:42:00,497,"Subaru has the best four wheel drive on the market and they run forever with routine maintenance. My suggestion is shop around Cliff, you may find a better deal on a Forester at another dealer. When my wife bought her Outback we shopped around quite a bit and saved more than you might think."
793092,Big Cliff,2013-06-17 17:17:00,6899,"Just curious? You started with an 08 but now have an 07? If I may ask, why the change?  2009 Forester and on are the re-desigined modles and have the better gas milage (and a bunch of other things). I have been looking for a good 2009 or newer, they are really hard to find and when you do, you are still looking at $18 - 19 thou for anything good + taxes. When I can get a 2013 Elantra for the same money (and I realize we are not compairing apples to apples here) I really am having a hard time trying to decide which way to go. I wouldn't mind a manual but Sue really would prefer an automatic. It is a really big investment for us especially now that I am semi retired."
793103,frozen-fire,2013-06-17 17:47:00,542," I wanted the power from the turbo version. Wasn't too keen on getting a newer wrx (08+) due to price and how they looked. I much prefered the GD chassis (02-07) and body style. Plus saved some money going back a year.  Here's my car as she sits now:   I find I'm getting older and not too into the fast car craze anymore. So I have been in and out of looking for a used forester. I was ready to let my WRX go (actually to a member on this forum), but decided I would keep it for a little while longer.  My very first car was a mitsubishi, then I got a civic...and finally went AWD with subaru and haven't looked back.  I came really close to getting an 06 Forester XT - auto. It had just over 100k km on it. Really clean car and was well maintained. Wanted to think it through and it got sold before I could decide. I kind of regret not jumping on that one. On one hand, I really wanted a 5spd because it's what I'm used to and it's a lot more fun to drive. But my better half would much prefer an auto so she could drive it as well."
793107,Big Cliff,2013-06-17 18:08:00,6899,"Wow, that is a nice looking car!!!!! I'm afraid I won't be getting anything like that, I'm well past the ""mid-life crises"" thing besides I'd probably never be able to get out of it LOL.. I just went into town to get a few things, wouldn't you know it, blew a brake line, Subaru is back in the shop again. I just figured it out and in the past month it has been costing me about $1.00/km to drive. Anyone want a good deal on an almost rebuilt Subaru LOL. (just kidding I wouldn't sell it, it is time for it to go bye bye. Makes me think of that Johnny Cash song One piece at a time!"
793109,Ainsley,2013-06-17 18:28:00,142,Not to drag the thread off topic but those 06-08 forester XTs are very nice.  I would have loved to pick one up but they were way out of my budget.
793114,Sinker,2013-06-17 18:47:00,8692,"Ainsley, is your forester an XT?  Mines an auto, but lots of people have offered to buy it from me. I'm driving it to the ground, then will likely get another.  S."
793115,Ainsley,2013-06-17 18:49:00,142,"I wish I could have gotten an XT, mine is just the XS."
793117,Sinker,2013-06-17 18:51:00,8692,"Sweet ride Frozen-fire. I almost had the same one, but the forester suits my needs much better. I just couldn't see the WRX towing my 16ft boat very far lol.  The XT doesn't even know its on there, but she burns a lot more fuel towing!  S."
793133,davey buoy,2013-06-17 19:36:00,5505,"Maybe I will look at a forester next,my 99 explorer Sport may not be the best on gas,but 432,000km on the dial and runs from 220-300km's a day.No sign of it dying any time soon,but loving this thread.Good luck Cliff,wondering if a forester would pull a 3000lb boat?I'm not sure?,but the gas saving on a daily commute may be worth looking into!!"
793157,Sinker,2013-06-17 22:08:00,8692,I wouldn't tow a 3000lb boat around too far/often with a forester. My whole rig is maaaybe 1200lbs fully loaded. It handles that no problem.  S.

792857,Big Cliff,2013-06-16 19:42:00,6899,"Well my 1998 Subaru Forester has served me well, this darn thing just keeps going (even got me home on two cylinders when the ignition module decided to quit) but it I think it is time to retire the old girl, she has 220,000 k on her, the body is still in good shape but I've just had to spend over $2000.00 on it in the last 6 months, new brakes, ignition module, new alternator and battery..... I fear that the cost to maintain it is getting to the point where it would be cheeper to buy something new.  As part of my (semi-retired) job requires me to drive down to Toronto once a week I'm getting a little leery about the ""what if's"" so I am thinking I'll be getting a new car this week. I have looked at several but narrowed it down to two that seem like they will be in my price range. Any feed back on either or both would be appreciated.  My first choice at this point is the 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT   But it is a toss up between the 2013 KIA SOLE  Both are about the same price give or take a couple of $$, I like the SOLE because it seems to be a cross between a car and an SUV but after driving the Elantra it handled beautifully, was very comfortable, and I really felt comfortable with the salesman.  Anyone own either of these or know someone that does? Any feedback would be much appreciated!"
792859,misfish,2013-06-16 19:59:00,29133,Support North America I say Cliff..
792862,SlowPoke,2013-06-16 20:12:00,2984,"The Kia SOLE will ended up costing more after you tint the windows so nobody can you see you driving it  We have a 2012 Elantra 4dr Sedan 6sp Manual. PHENOMENAL on gas. My wife averaged 4.9 L/100 yesterday from London to Sauble Beach  The dealers in our area will bend over backwards for customer satisfaction. Car wash and paint touch-ups (stone chips) at each service for example. Courtesy car for overnight warranty work was negotiated into the deal.  Two minor problems fixed no charge in 36,000 km - tube from AC evaporator came off. - exhaust clamp loosened causing an occasional tinny sound under vibration.  Personally, I would decline the electronic rust protection but my wife liked the body warranty and no inspection policy. I prefer Krown rustproofing myself. I don't care for the Elantra GT look but its better than the SOLE!! Happy so far and would buy another; maybe even the Sonata next time."

792866,SlowPoke,2013-06-16 20:19:00,2984,"I don't think you can come close to matching value and quality in that price range. Also keep in mind, you are supporting a dealer and transportation network that keeps your friends and neighbours employed."
792867,misfish,2013-06-16 20:26:00,29133," I can see this will get argumentive,not fair to the OP,I feel buying north america ,supports more then just a dealer and a few wrench monkeys. Take no offence Brian,as I dont. This is just  my opinion. SUPPORT YOUR OWN."
792872,crappieperchhunter,2013-06-16 20:41:00,2582,"Good luck with whatever you go with Cliff. Debbe and I got a 2013 Hyundia Sante Fe in March. I know that is not one of your choices, however I thought I would mention that this is our 3rd Hyundia vehicle and Ontario Hyundia who we deal with hear in Oshawa...well the dealership is in Whitby... has treated us very well...I can't say enough about them.  Also our other 2 Hyundia's which where both Accents where bullet proof and cost next to nothing to maintain...Debbe is driving the 2006 right now. Although it is only fair to mention the Accents where Debbe's daily driver...12 KM a day to and from work so they never had any tough sledding to do. But some say just puttering around town is harder on a car then getting it out on the hiway. Just thought I would mention how happy we have been with Hyundia Cliff. Again good luck with your car hunting."
792874,Sinker,2013-06-16 20:52:00,8692,"I think maintaining/repairing your forester would be cheaper than a monthly payment on a new car. I have 280k on my forester, and she runs like a top. Last year I spent less than $2G to keep her on the road. Very reliable, and very, very versitile vehicle. I think you will miss the subaru when she's gone.  S."

792878,Rod Caster,2013-06-16 21:10:00,5784,"The hyundai is a nice car, big for the price and you'll love it while it runs well.  Now, my buddy is a mechanic for Hyundai and he is adamant that he would never buy a Hyundai. He says the Toyota's and Honda's are WAY better built. Take this information for what it is...third hand info...but maybe consider one of the brands better known for reliability?? And...for Brian, a lot of Corolla's and Civics are build in Canada. I have 2009 Corolla, with 150k, built in Canada, and it's an absolute gem and drives like new with no issues since new.  Either way, good luck, hope you get a good deal!!!!"
792881,FloatnFly,2013-06-16 21:19:00,1640,"   lets do the math on that say you spent 1700 on it last year, thats 141/month or a car payment every month, if it costs you that much every year to keep on the road, its time for a new vehicle with warranty.     OP, im a ford guy, so obviously my first choices would be either the focus or fusion for around 20k with great gas mileage, or i have driven the the new ford taurus, its not a grandmas car anymore, its quite nice, but starts at 26k for a 2013"
792882,misfish,2013-06-16 21:20:00,29133," Yup,Alliston ONT and Cambridge,ONT. North American MADE ,TY for pointing that out.."
792883,captpierre,2013-06-16 21:25:00,2521,"A step down going Korean.  Forester is currently the top rated small SUV/wagon in Consumer Reports.  Best AWD system, crash test, resale.  I prefer the look of the Outback.  it will be our next car."
792884,northernpike56,2013-06-16 21:28:00,717,"Ever considered a slightly used car? Ex. You can buy a 2011 or so bmw 3 series for the same price as most new japanese cars. Euro cars traditionally come with really long and excellent warranties too.  And also the ""american brand means american jobs"" thing is somewhat a saying from the past... Look at the toyota plant in woodstock, for example. However, most euro cars such as bmw and m-benz are built in germany and shipped over on a boat."
792886,FloatnFly,2013-06-16 21:31:00,1640,"  yea, you can get a slightly used bmw of benz, but ever price out replacement parts for one? or a set of tires even.....not cheap, theres a reason why people get rid of them when the warranty is up"
792890,northernpike56,2013-06-16 21:40:00,717,"Ya ik, my dad just got new tires and front brakes for his 335i, it cost a little over 3000$ i think, but while they are still in warranty, and relatively new, they are awesome. My neighbour has a brand new C63 AMG and that car is so cool"
792892,adempsey,2013-06-16 21:57:00,1498,"I just can't see someone named ""Big Cliff"" driving a Kia Soul.  I've seen plenty of good reviews on both those cars,  so I think you'd be fine with either as long as you like them.  I bought a new car 2 weeks ago.  I was in the same situation as you.  Narrowed down to two cars - Mazda CX-5 and Subaru Forester.    I had a slight preference for the Mazda, but if I didn't get a good deal I would have seen what I could have done with the Forester.  I suggest you make sure you look at all the dealers in an area equal to the distance you're willing to drive, not just locally.   Also use the internet to your advantage.   I found a salesperson through internet forums who straight up offered me 2% over invoice with no dealership fees (Nitrogen, Globali and all that other garbage).   Almost everyone else played games.   Honda and Toyota were some of the worst in my experience.  Good luck!!"
792894,FloatnFly,2013-06-16 22:09:00,1640,"  yea, this, i bought my truck through the guy that buys vehicles for the dealership, so was able to get for just above the price he paid at auction for it, and 5k less then what the dealership wanted"
792896,SlowPoke,2013-06-16 22:19:00,2984,"""Support your own"" is always my first choice but when it comes to a big ticket item like a car, I support me first. In my opinion, the Elantra is unmatched for style, service and quality in its price range. I think you're also underestimating the number of quality jobs a dealership supports. Also, it won't be long before Hyundai starts building in North America and hopefully turning the lights on in some vacant plants and employing displaced workers. It's brands like Hyundai, Toyota and Honda that put the big three where they were a few years ago and forced them to step up their made in North America quality. Competition is a good thing and consumers will benefit from it. Toyota has done a world of good for Woodstock and the local feeder plants. I'm okay with attracting foreign investment in Canadian jobs. Ford on the other hand has hurt a lot of local industry by closing the Talbotville plant. Just so you know, I always check for COO (country of origin) when I am purchasing something. If I can get the same or better quality made in North America, I'm willing to shell out a few extra bucks. I don't think I'll be changing your opinion but I wanted to expand on my thoughts."
792904,Sinker,2013-06-16 23:10:00,8692,"Maybe so, but your not getting much for $141/mo, or your putting out A large downpayment.  Your also not getting the versitality of the subaru forster. Just wait till the snow flies, or you need to get up a slippery hill......you'll be missing the forester. What about when you kill your deer this fall? Gonna throw it in the back of the soul? Have to tow your trialer around?  I'm a bit biased, my forester has been awesome, and if/when it dies, I'm getting another one. At 270K it owes me nothing. S."
792905,Big Cliff,2013-06-16 23:14:00,6899,"Thanks guys, I would love to be able to afford a new Forester but I can't justify spending that much. I did look at Honda, Toyota, and Ford, wouldn't touch a GM if you gave it to me after having a really bad experience with their lack of customer service. I told them then that I wouldn't ever buy one of their products again.  As for keeping this old girl alive, it needs front end work, a new sensor, parking brake just quit working and the exhaust system is starting to get a little loud. The power steering lines will have to be replaced one day soon, the cruse control has quit working and high speed on the blower fan no longer works. I am concerned that if the transmission or engine do decide to fail I'll have so much money invested in it that I'd end up having to sink even more ito it. Got to draw the line somewhere.  I can buy a brand new Elantra CT for $306.00 a month with nothing down at zero% financing. With the amount of driving I am doing right now I expect to see a minimum 30% reduction just in my fuel costs which will save me over $100.00 a month. Still got some thinking to do though, it is a big investment for us."
792908,Sinker,2013-06-16 23:17:00,8692,I'm really surprised to hear you've had that many issues with your forester. Wow......  S.
792911,Big Cliff,2013-06-16 23:21:00,6899,"I do love the Forester, no question about it but it starts at about @ $26,000.00 and goes up quite quickly from there. What year is your Forester Sinker?"
792913,lew,2013-06-16 23:25:00,12766,"Don't try to justify it Cliff, just go ahead and buy it, you work hard and deserve it. I buy a new truck every 3 or 4 years and it's a great feeling being behind the wheel of a nice new vehicle.  Plus the fact it's under warranty and you don't have the worries associated with an old car."
792917,Sinker,2013-06-16 23:35:00,8692,"Mine is an '04, and its also a turbo.  I haven't had many issues. Did some front end work at about 200k ($1200), and just replaced a wheel bearing($200). Other than that just brakes, tires, and oil changes.  It will probably blow up on me now tho......lol   S."
