A great example for reasons to keep in good physical shape and shed those extra pounds. Of course the details aren't fully out yet but When a still young person dies of a heart attack and they are overweight it sure seems like a waste. Anyway, RIP http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/19/showbiz/james-gandolfini-obituary/index.html "
