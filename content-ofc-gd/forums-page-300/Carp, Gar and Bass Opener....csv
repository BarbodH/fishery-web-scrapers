A short recap.Had a Father/Son combo out for Gar last week sometime, the trash talk was awesome between them.  The Dad took the lead for big fish early with this 48""er.Dad was chirping the kid bad until the kid beat his best fish for the day by an inch with a 49""er.    Then the tide turned!Took Chevy and Mickey down to the Larry for day on the Carp.  Needed a relaxing day on the banks!  Well it wasn't very relaxing... Great day it was down there, more pics of our day are here: http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1250Birdee and I slid out for 3 hours on Saturday night for Bass opener.  Total frog bite.  The Jackall Iobee stole the show.  Into a long stretch of time on the water starting Wednesday.  We only have a few dates available if anyone is looking to book a day on the water, drop us a line asap if interested!RJ"
