793466,Dave Bailey,2013-06-19 12:52:00,1641,Beauty!  But wait a sec... You're targeting bass and getting a walleye? When I target bass I get pike.What am I doing wrong?
793578,walleye_man,2013-06-19 21:50:00,135,"Thanks everyone! I am still completely in shock from the walleye! She was 30 inches, have no idea on a weight,8-10 pounds?  and as for getting walleye bass fishin, this is one of those rare lakes that you can get the walleye flipping trees with texas rigged plastics. Usually there not this big though :0"
