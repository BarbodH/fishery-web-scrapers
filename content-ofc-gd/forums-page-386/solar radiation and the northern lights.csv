The solar storm began Thursday when a sunspot unleashed a huge flare that hurled a cloud of highly charged particles toward earth at almost 5-million kilometres an hour.  Scientists say it’s the strongest sun storm so far this summer, adding it could be up to 300-thousand kilometres long.  NASA says the solar eruption could trigger an exceptional northern lights display that may be seen as far south as Alabama and California.  There have been five previous solar outbursts already this year, but none caused any problems on Earth."
