713844,Steve,2012-07-11 20:57:00,2075,"as well, the prime spawning fish need to be left alone during the spawn, and not targetted under the guise of ""pike"" fishing."
713872,smally21,2012-07-11 22:25:00,993,fish i catch down there are covered in lesions and body sores. i don't want to touch them let alone take them home. there are perch and other panfish out in the bay proper and around lasalle marine that has somewhat better water quality.  all beaches are closed again right now. local marinas advise flushing the acidic water everytime you boat there. the anchor comes up covered in pitch/tarlike product that is impossible to wash off your hands or boat.  the myth of poor water quality is not a myth. though it is much better than it used to be.
713873,Steve,2012-07-11 22:28:00,2075,"and smally21, the ""pro's"" are having a tough time catching bass down there as well.  the recent twilight tournament, by the hamilton bassmasters, had very poor results, as did the fun tournament held two Saturday's ago."
713878,lew,2012-07-11 22:57:00,12766, I just removed Hamilton Harbour from my bucket list
713881,bdox,2012-07-11 23:06:00,329,"The Bayfront/Pier 4 beaches get closed mostly due to E. Coli caused by Goose and Swan feces, and in turn, the idiots who insist on feeding them. I would say maybe 1 in 10 bass we catch from the Harbor are outfitted with the lesions and sores that smally21 mentioned. That being said, I still wouldn't fry up a fish from that water, even a panfish from the main basin."
713907,hammercarp,2012-07-12 01:27:00,964,I saw some big sheephead cruising around the Haida and Pier 8 last week. They will give you a go on a lure.
713908,uglyfish,2012-07-12 01:29:00,981,"Pier 4 beach is open for swimming as of last check. But yes, its typically due to all the geese crap from morons feeding them.  As yes, the twilight tourney last nite had 5 fish, for 20 anglers. I fished the event with the winner. The fishing was very tough. More weeds then I really remember seeing down there and the water was quite dirty due to the wind. But on the flip side, we've had evening events down there that had 15lb bags for the top 3 teams, not to mention fish in the 4 and 5lb classes come to the scales. And 97% of the fish all look very healthy  u'll find fish on any and every lake that has sore or lesions or some kind of deformation"
713932,ld17,2012-07-12 03:00:00,319,The Harbour will always be near and dear to my heart.  We should be so lucky to have a place so close to home to fish.  I would say in the last 4 years there has been a decline in the quality of fish ( bass ) being caught.  Don't know what it could be.  During the spawn there are all kinds of bass present so not sure if they are getting really smart or just pulling out and going off shore.  I hope this trend will swing back to days of going down and catching a limit in a few hours of fishing.  Time will tell.  I will still be fishing down there.  You just might have to think outside the box more an more.  I think a lot of anglers are getting better at catching fish.
713969,Live2fish85,2012-07-12 14:19:00,1633,Steve  You really shouldn't talk like you know everyone that says they are fishing pike down there is going for bass. I fish there for pike while bass are closed and do actually catch pike and a decent amount.  Before you say something maybe you should check what people are using before assuming. I don't know many people that use a 30# flouro leader with a large husky jerk for bass.
713983,smally21,2012-07-12 15:15:00,993,"im happy to hear you are catching some healthier looking fish. that is good news indeed. ive caught some 4-5 lb bass in there, alot of gobies...the far side of the bay can feel like cottage country. lots of small cats that act like bass, caught on the same gear, fight the same..its kind of different than their behaviour i have noticed elsewhere. the carp put on quite a show during their busy season and sometimes if you walk behind the big (former) canada centre they are so thick, just below the surface you could walk across them.  perhaps i shouldn`t be so negative towards it , the area is used by lots of people that get enjoyment out of it.   and lew - no one will make you swim in it!"
714000,Mike Pike,2012-07-12 16:27:00,1332,"When I was a young fella, growing up in Hamilton, a port city, I had no conncetion to the water.  As kids, we had very limited access to the harbour.  It was just steel mills and rail yards.  Today, hundreds( maybe thousands )of people of all ages walk, bike and rollerblade along the waterfront trails and fish the waters, everyday.  Even without a boat, there is so much fishable water for any species you care to target.  Guys who put in their time, do well with bass( large and smallmouth ), pike in the spring and even steelhead and salmon come fall.  Not to mention, the multi species fishery come winter when ice sets in.  No, I definately wouldn't put it on my bucket list if I were you either Lew 'cuz you now live in God's country fer sure!  But for those of us in and around the Hammer, it's a great place to enjoy in a lot of different ways."
714001,BillM,2012-07-12 16:33:00,17367,They should probably just nuke Hamilton Harbour and start over.
714014,lew,2012-07-12 17:04:00,12766," Sorry Mike, I wasn't putting anyone down , just being sarcastic and I spose I should have added the emoticom...or whatever it's called"
714037,Mike Pike,2012-07-12 18:27:00,1332,"LOL  No worries, Lew.  I never took it that way."
714232,Steve,2012-07-13 11:31:00,2075,"Live2Fish85, after watching the decline over the last 10 years, seeing fish caught on opener with four and five hook marks already in their mouths, and seeing guys throw spinnerbaits at spawning bass, while ""pike"" fishing, I'm sorry - they should make the harbour a fishing sanctuary until bass opener.  there are lots of bodies of water found on the great lakes that already have sanctuaries instituted until bass opener - and they contain pike.  I would love to see the same in the harbour.  But like anything, policing it would be a major challenge."
714249,Live2fish85,2012-07-13 12:37:00,1633,"Steve, unfortunately the harbour isn't  a great fishery. The other reason you may have seen the fishing decline is that fishing has become alot more common, putting more pressure on them.  If you know anything about bass you would realize that catching a spawning bass isn't going to hurt it or cause them to not hit again. Looks at the US they put there money into the fisheries properly.  Has bass fishing been affected by all season fishing in the states, I think not.  I also grew up on Lake Erie, my parents still live there and I will fish for pike in there bay but they come around not to often there and are hard to come by. I also catch some smallies while trying. Not to mention the other people out the targeting the smallies while they are spawning.  Guess what the fishing is still great and hasn't declined. It also doesn't see half the pressure that the harbour see.  The harbour won't become a sanctuary because the fiahing isn't good really. The bass aren't great I could catch a ton more on Erie abd many other Lakes.  All I think is your an ass when you assume everyone is poaching."
714284,Steve,2012-07-13 14:13:00,2075,"I'm sorry you feel the harbour is not a great fishery. I disagree.  However, like you said, pressure has created challenges on fish catches.  With the population around it, it had to be expected.  Just to clarify, I didn't say anyone fishing pike was poaching bass - just the ones that are casting AT spawning bass, over and over, with spinnerbaits....  the single best one was the guy throwing the scum frog over the grass saying he was carp fishing.  Either way, I don't agree pulling bass off their spawning nests doesn't affect their spawn, especially with the goby and brown bullhead population in the harbour."
714292,Live2fish85,2012-07-13 14:46:00,1633,"I have seen guys down there with senkos that I would say is going for bass. Spinnerbaits do work well for pike so I won't say they are going for spawning bass. Using a frog I would agree is going for bass.  There are alot better places then the harbour for fishing, maybe not in hamilton.  Studies show that bass aren't effected by it. Believe me the states does one thing right and that is there fisheries. They make us look like were a joke when it comes to fisheries.  I appologize for saying your an ass, that was rude but I don't like be told I am poaching for fishing for pike. I can wait for bass opener to go and fish Erie where it is actually a great lake for them."
714298,Steve,2012-07-13 15:31:00,2075,"hey, no problem with the ass comment.  I am one."
714387,fishing,2012-07-13 20:43:00,167,Very nice gentlemen!
712845,hotsky,2012-07-09 03:16:00,400,"I'm in Hamilton and been to the harbour (Pier 4) twice for a couple of hours each time with no luck. I was by myself using lures (I don't like using livebait as it gets boring just sitting and waiting). I usually catch something at Cootes tho... I was thinking of renting a canoe from a place by QEW bridge but after last time I'm almost ready to give up on the harbour.  I've seen carp in the water, I know there's some bass and pike, what else? Is the harbour known for anything specific? Would like to hear of any good spots and lures to use?  Thanks!  ps: if someone doesn't want to sear the info public feel free to PM me."
712857,northernpike56,2012-07-09 04:08:00,717,sheepies and gobbys
712861,fishing,2012-07-09 05:10:00,167,"White perch and catfish for sure. Salmon, rainbow, brown, yellow perch, sunfish, rock bass, bowfin and crappie are good. Also walleye and lake trout. May take a couple of years to learn them all though. Like salmon, we may have to show up early in the morning or later in the evening."
712865,bigugli,2012-07-09 05:31:00,6138,So much depends on time of year and where. I've been there for some great perch and cat fishing. The harbour is a big body of water.
713311,Rich,2012-07-10 14:15:00,3927,"Fishing is always worth it. You won't catch anything at home. HH is close and very shore accessible. You'd be surprised the giant fish that can appear from nowhere and annihilate your bait down there, even on the slowest of days."
713319,pics,2012-07-10 14:46:00,1268,The only area where fishing is not allowed is in the marinas. Other than that the city encourages fishing along the waterfront....
713339,uglyfish,2012-07-10 15:47:00,981, lol who says u cant fish in the marinas? theres accessable areas around the marinas u can fish.
713346,hotsky,2012-07-10 16:06:00,400,He probably meant from the docks next to the boats. Then if it's a private property I guess it would be illegal. Lots of places to fish at the Bay and Pier 4 tho.
713422,pics,2012-07-10 19:01:00,1268,"You can't fish too close to the boats for obvious reasons....even if it was public property, casting a plug towards a hundred thousand dollar boat might get you tossed from the area. There are miles of waterfront to fish anyways and the city encourages it as well(unlike other cities around here)It would also help the cause if we all took home our garbage and maybe a few other bits that the slobs leave behind...."
713436,Live2fish85,2012-07-10 19:41:00,1633,You can fish around the marinas and there is alot of fish in them. If your aren't a moron and casting at the boats they don't care.  Don't smoke in the park as the stupid city has made it law now lol.
713438,hotsky,2012-07-10 19:51:00,400,
713439,Live2fish85,2012-07-10 19:52:00,1633,Nope not allowed to smoke in the park anymore or its a $300 + fine.
713469,Live2fish85,2012-07-10 20:47:00,1633,Lol I agree Sinclair. I don't smoke in my house or anything and I understand the law about not smoking in a car with kids but in a park is just stupid. It truely isn't hurting anyone especially at Hamilton Harbour.
713489,Acountdeleted,2012-07-10 21:26:00,2562,My buddy and I went there a while ago and were having a lot of success right before sundown using topwaters. The Rock and Largemouth bass were chasing after everything we threw out. Not a bad little spot for shore fishing.
713615,cwpres,2012-07-11 04:07:00,14," I beg to differ... I have asthma and second hand smoke bothers me a lot.  On several occasions, I've had to leave an area where I've been fishing because someone came along and sat down near me and started smoking."
713640,smally21,2012-07-11 11:43:00,993,"i go there when i dont have time to drive elsewhere. its not spectacular but it is full of surprises. i fish from a boat so cant say much about the shorelines, but there is lots of it.  the algae blooms can get pretty discouraging but work around them.  as to the smoking? well there it is. the entirity of bayfront no smoking seems a bit extreme, though i certainly agree in the playground and more public areas. im looking forward to at least some parts of Hamilton that aren't knee deep in butts. sometimes i swear this city is paved in cigarette butts, ya can't take 2 steps without seeing one."
713649,Live2fish85,2012-07-11 12:09:00,1633,I understand a 100% about not smoling on playgrounds.  I have asthma as well and to be honest the smell of a smoke a foot away isn't to hard on the asthma. Being in hamilton harbour is harder on it and worst when it is super humid.  I rarely throw my smokes on the ground when I am out. I usually make sure it is out and in the garbage.  It is a joke. If they want to keep it clean then make a law that the Hamilton scum aren't allowed down there to leave there garbage an crack pipe and needles.
713676,Fish Farmer,2012-07-11 13:32:00,2234,"I have a friend that fishes the harbor almost every day, he has told me some impressive stories about fish he has caught. In-fact, he's got me fishin the bay once in awhile. Being a retired Stelco worker, I try and keep my eyes looking to the west . Years ago, I would have never thought of fishin the Harbor, but hay, it's close to home and better than watchin the tube."
713680,hotsky,2012-07-11 13:50:00,400,"If you want to talk about dirty, go to the Windermere basin or where it used to be. I've been there a couple of times recently and they are still doing construction work so it's just a channel of water there (saw some huge carp swimming around but they are probably spawning because they completely ignored my bait). The water is incredibly dirty there; I don't even know how many tampons I saw floating around!"
713683,Fish Farmer,2012-07-11 13:59:00,2234,Almost sounds like a good spot to farm Tilapia or Basa
713721,Squid,2012-07-11 15:27:00,1656,LOL FF!!
713734,bdox,2012-07-11 16:09:00,329, That's because there are multiple sewer/waste/storm overflows in that area. After a good rain you can usually see 100s of floating tampons in the South-East part of the harbor.
713754,Steve,2012-07-11 17:11:00,2075,gotta love it when you have to kick the tampon applicators aside on the liftbridge ramp just to launch.  too bad the carp won't eat those things as well.
713778,uglyfish,2012-07-11 18:10:00,981,"fishing gets tougher down there each year. the area gets pounded with anglers and the fish are very accustomed to seeing all they have to throw. nite fishing can be good. as long as people practice catch and release it can continue to be a good fishery. u would really be amazed at the amount and quality of the fish down there. but its a place u really have to put ur time in. some days are good, some are very bad."
713830,uglyfish,2012-07-11 20:17:00,981," of course they do! not uncommon to see asians (no predjudice intended) or older folks down there filling a bucket. the fish there are no more or less harmful then from any other body of water around here. but to keep a sustainable fisherty, prime spawning fish have to be released."
