713527,mike rousseau,2012-07-10 23:04:00,4661,"Im heading up to the Ottawa river for some musky this weekend... I've only been there once before and moved about 6 fish that day by myself... So I think I have a ""decent"" grasp on things there... But it is very different from the st.lawrence that I'm used to... The fish seem to hold shallower... And the dirty water effects what colors produce...  But I'm looking for some Ottawa river specific tips to help me boat a few...  What type of structure do you guys like there...?  Favorite style of baits...?  Colors?  Any tips would be great....  I'll be fishing somewhere between Ottawa and hawksbury...  Like I said... I found spots that have musky... And I have a few more to try...  But as you guys know.... Any local tips can really help...  Thanks  Mike"

Was in a boat with another guy who got a biggun twitching a white Sledge and I've trolled up a few with  Bumble Bee Believers.  Myself, I like that murky water much more than clear."
713541,mike rousseau,2012-07-10 23:48:00,4661,Ive heard high contrast inlines and topwaters rule there...  So my game plan is to use some black/chartrues and black/orange handlebarz...  And top raiders for the most part..  With some suicks and glide baits mixed in when depth/ weeds will permit...  And some trolling to give the arms a break...  And I moved several fish in pencil weeds last time I was there Lew... That's where the highest concentration I found was...

713629,mike rousseau,2012-07-11 10:56:00,4661,  Thanks...
713836,esoxansteel,2012-07-11 20:38:00,1307,"  Come on Matt, your holding out on us, that little post on the Rideau with Lakers, was just to steer the musky gods away from the Ottawa wasnt it"
713853,Handlebarz,2012-07-11 21:12:00,3790,Mike be sure to bring all your Handlebarz as I know the guys use alot of blades there. Sledges are also popular for casting. Pm Matt maybe he will get more specific on areas
713855,Spiel,2012-07-11 21:13:00,9065,I have nothing to offer Mike but I've no doubt you'll move fish and likely boat some. Have a great weekend.
713867,mike rousseau,2012-07-11 21:45:00,4661,  Thanks  The wife is going to Guelph and taking my son so I have no strings all weekend...

I hope the fish help make this a great weekend...
714416,mercman,2012-07-13 22:55:00,7054, So.....How was it so far Bud?
714424,muskymatt,2012-07-13 23:22:00,2608," Water levels are way down, temp is up and it's dirty, probably from lack of current. Its been so hot I haven't been out on the Ottawa since June 24th and will likely not go out until August at this rate.  We need rain and cooler temps.  Lakers have been good lately though"
