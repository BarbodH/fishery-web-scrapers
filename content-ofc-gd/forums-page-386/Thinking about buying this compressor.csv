714305,NAW,2012-07-13 15:54:00,4022,http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_detail.jsp;jsessionid=QQDRlLQfR4flp5yQS2lWLDHNpfs9lkXKN227Gy4FT44S22nXhVT1!-2016436331?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524443326920&bmUID=1342194673865  I need one for minor jobs around the house.  I will be using it for small jobs around the house.  Biggest job would be running a pneumatic chizle.  Maybe an impact gun for doing tires on my car.  I'm not sure what size I need?  Worried this one might be to small.
714306,BillM,2012-07-13 16:00:00,17367,"Probably fine for normal hand tools, but not enough CFM to bust loose your lugnuts."
714310,redpearl99,2012-07-13 16:09:00,259,way too small for auto tools. with a 2 gallon taken the most you could really do is inflate tires and airbrush.
714311,Fisherman,2012-07-13 16:10:00,7201,"IMO, a complete waste of time for anything but pumping up tires and dust blowing.  Most tools require a minimum of about 5CFM @ 90psi to be efficient."
714329,cuzza,2012-07-13 17:23:00,467,"Yeah - you need more than that, most air chisels and impact wrenches are in the 3-5 cfm range"
714331,tb4me,2012-07-13 17:27:00,3295,if you do get that one get a long hose..Those oil less comps are LOUD!
714332,Crunchy,2012-07-13 17:27:00,6,"Ditto. I have a very high efficiency (and high $) impact, and it can barely get by with 5cfm....my 30gallon 3hp is the minimum I can use it with.  Found my compressor on kijiji ,about 15 years old....for $40."
714337,ecmilley,2012-07-13 17:51:00,2163,"i have a 2g at home it's good for tires and the nail gun that's about it, and all i use it for. you would need 5 cfm min to run an air chisel or decent impact gun. the oil less compressors are very loud, i would go to tsc or princess auto to find a compressor that will fit your requirements"
714339,misfish,2012-07-13 17:57:00,29133,"Hey Nick. Just outside of Barrie on hwy 90,theres one for sale.It,s on the right hand side of the road.Worth checking out.  Like others have said,that ones,not for your needs."
714375,woodenboater,2012-07-13 19:57:00,2277,"Have a Campbell Hausfield from CTC and it's 'ok', too loud for my taste but the price was right. Also have a Gast which totally rocks. Quiet as all heck compared to the CH. Both are around 2 gallon though so no heavy lifting..."
714397,NAW,2012-07-13 21:50:00,4022,"Thanks for the tips everyone.  I guess I never thought about getting a compressor on Kijiji because I don't know how to fix them if it's not working right.  But I guess I can figure out how to fix anything in the U-Tube age.  I'll do a little Kijiji research, and see if I can get a good deal on something with a little more CFM.  Thanks again"
714398,NAW,2012-07-13 21:50:00,4022, Thanks Brian.  I'll have to check that out!
714441,Ainsley,2012-07-14 01:25:00,142,If you decide not to go with a larger shop size comp I'd highly suggest going with a makita. I have the smaller of the three and its great for running nailers. I've even done some painting with a HVLP spray gun on a small repair on my old truck. The oiled compressor is much quieter than the oil-less I've heard and after about 5+ years I haven't had any problems. That being said I'd love a nice two stage 220V oiled comp on a big tank for the shop.
714443,Twocoda,2012-07-14 01:53:00,4130,NAW i have a 6.5 horse 11.5 cfm @ 40 psi /10.5 cfm @ 90 psi 60 gallon upright 220v you can have for 350.00 i paid a thousand for it 6 years ago and i never use it anymore...PM if your interested...i didnt have any intentions on selling it...but it is just sitting there collecting dust
714469,SlowPoke,2012-07-14 12:26:00,2984,"I would never recommend an oilless compressor. If you're looking for a cheap portable, I've had this one for three years and no issues. http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/6/Tools/1/CompressorsAirTools/Compressors/PRDOVR~0587949P/MotoMaster+5-Gallon+Twin-stack+Air+Compressor.jsp?locale=en It will work fine for tires, blow gun, air nailer/stapler and you might be able to run a ratchet off it but I've never tried. They often go on sale for $120"
714549,NAW,2012-07-14 18:28:00,4022,"I put an offer in on a Kijiji add for a Makita.  Smaller unit, but a double tank 5 gallon unit.  Thanks for the advice.  I really appreciate that.  I'm looking for something smaller, and cheaper.   That is very similar to the Makita one I put an offer in on.  Should work great for what I need.  Thanks for the info and link"
714555,vinnimon,2012-07-14 19:36:00,2593,"Hey NAW , im thinking of selling my compressor, a 60 gallon upright. More than enough for what you need it for. pm me if interested"
714773,Billy Bob,2012-07-15 23:44:00,5865,Have you consider one from Harbor Freight.......  http://www.harborfreight.com/air-tools/air-compressors.html
714779,BillM,2012-07-15 23:51:00,17367,"  BB, no Harbor Freights up here unfortunately.  Although we do have Princess Auto which is very similar"
714824,GYPSY400,2012-07-16 01:46:00,191,"I have a campbell Hausefield 8 gallon compressor. It's 5 years old and hasn't missed a beat. Works good for tires, impact guns etc.  but lacks volume for air drills, die grinders or air ratchets.."
