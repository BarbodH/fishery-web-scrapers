714709,ChrisK,2012-07-15 18:30:00,2772,I was in the Pro Hardware in Exeter this week and they had a whole selection of Tilley hats there if anyone is interested in this area. Also here is a shot of the inside of my Tilley with all the information anyone would need to return or special order the product.  
714515,SlowPoke,2012-07-14 15:52:00,2984,"I ordered a Tilley from their website, paid full price and opted for express shipping... $105.66 This is very unlike me but I couldn't find THIS hat in MY SIZE anywhere!  I've tried on several other Tilley's and found the size I needed... 7 3/4 Mine comes in the mail and it's to small.  Customer service was very friendly and said to ship the hat back... $11.50 New hat comes quickly and it fits great BUT a couple of defects. I called customer service and again, very pleased to accept return and send out a new one. I said that's great but I've already returned one at my expense and I don't feel that I should foot the return shipping charges for a hat with defects. She agreed and said to use the return shipping label and I will only be charged if its not to be considered a defect. (no worries there, its pretty obvious).  I can't find the return label!!  It seems they only include a return label on US shipments but she said that I would be reimbursed.  Am I just too picky? The bucket is turned on the brim by 3/4"" and there is a permanent pucker on the lid where it meets the mesh."
714516,Christopheraaron,2012-07-14 15:58:00,3525,"For that price no, just picky enough"
714521,Ralph Field,2012-07-14 16:31:00,1018,If you have a CAA office near you they carry Tilley hats and may be able to help you out by a simple exchange.
714538,scugpg,2012-07-14 17:18:00,1373,See if Novacks can put you in touch with the right folks. They sell tons of them bud.
714539,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 17:27:00,5865,So......you gave up fishing and took up Pipping.....
714540,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 17:27:00,5865,"And NO, you're not being too picky....."
714542,nofish4me,2012-07-14 17:41:00,404,"Not too picky at all.  I have problems with hat size, myself.  Went to several retail places and finally went to Novacks.  Found an Austrailian Outback that fit perfect. It's a waxed cotton and not anywhere near that price.  Seems to me, you bought a Stetson and I got a Smithbilt. Hahaha"
714543,jedimaster,2012-07-14 18:02:00,3472,"The tilley store is right near where I work, if you want to ship it to me in toronto, I could exchange it for you in store if you want, maybe call them frist. Its the one on don mills."
714544,SlowPoke,2012-07-14 18:02:00,2984,"Never heard of Novack's until now. I doubt they or CAA will be interested in exchanging product for a sale they did not make. I'm sure I'd have better luck at a Tilley Corp. store though. I don't mind dealing with Tilley directly, they've been fast and friendly. Just a little bad luck."
714545,SlowPoke,2012-07-14 18:05:00,2984, I think you meant to type pimping? I already have a bunch of fluorescent Fedoras... just needed something casual. LOL
714546,jedimaster,2012-07-14 18:08:00,3472,"I was gonna buy an indiana jones hat to wear fishing this year, but. When I tried one on I realized I would need a whip to complete the look, and my tournament partner refuses to scream ""Da plane Boss da plane"" every time I hook a fish."
714548,nofish4me,2012-07-14 18:19:00,404,  Where you been? How long have you lived in London? Hahaha
714550,SlowPoke,2012-07-14 18:38:00,2984," Go easy on me, I've only been in London about 16 years."
714560,nofish4me,2012-07-14 19:51:00,404,"  Ok. Hahaha  It's been a ""Go to"" place long before that.  I have gone there since the mid 70's and I'm always surprised."
714601,Billy Bob,2012-07-15 00:07:00,5865,"Are we talking London, England........"
714659,nofish4me,2012-07-15 13:24:00,404,"  London Ontario Canada, eh. Hahaha"
714661,Twocoda,2012-07-15 13:35:00,4130,do they still have the bear in the window of Novaks?....just saying that name brings back smells...i got my very first swiss army knife there when i was 10....saved my allowance for three weeks...lost it the second day i had it ... 
714665,Roy,2012-07-15 13:52:00,13728, Allowance? When did this come about?
714668,SlowPoke,2012-07-15 14:15:00,2984,"You missed the boat on this one Roy, kids started getting an allowance right after the invention of the horseless carriage and around the same time as the popularized phrase ""Father, can I have a few dollars and a ride to the trading post?"""
714672,Skipper D,2012-07-15 14:27:00,1970,Is there a way to wear a perfect Tilley on ones head as not to create any puckers once it's in place  ?????  .
714674,cram,2012-07-15 14:32:00,1733,"They should be able to send you a shipping label, or you ship it back and they credit you for the cost.  LL Bean does it this way."
714675,cram,2012-07-15 14:33:00,1733,btw - Sail also carries them
714686,SlowPoke,2012-07-15 15:33:00,2984,"Sorry, I missed this post. Thanks for the offer but there's no need to put you out. I'll send it back and slip a note in there to thoroughly check the replacement.  The pucker is the lesser of the two issues. The bucket is sewn on crooked so it either doesn't fit right and the brim looks okay or it fits right and I look like a punk wearing their hat sideways.  They don't provide shipping labels on Canadian orders and will be refunding the postage.  Been there. They have a bunch but not in my style and size."
714690,icefisherman,2012-07-15 15:47:00,952,"So Brian, how much was the hat itself? I've been thinking of getting one of those from their Toronto store for quite some time... And yes you haven't been picky enough.,...if you were...you would have gotten a free new hat  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
714693,SlowPoke,2012-07-15 16:15:00,2984,"The hat was $82 + Tax + Shipping I know, I know... free hat. I'm going to warn Alex Tilley that you're thinking of buying one."
