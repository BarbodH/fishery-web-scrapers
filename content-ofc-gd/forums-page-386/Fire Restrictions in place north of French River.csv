714235,capt_hooked,2012-07-13 12:13:00,212,Warm and dry conditions has resulted in a total fire ban north of the French and Mattawa Rivers...  There were 33 new fire starts in the province yesterday and 22 new starts the day before..   If you are planning a camping trip.. I understand it is o.k. to use propane or gas stoves for cooking only. No open fires allowed. Fines can be up to $1000.00  here is the site: http://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fire/interactivemap/firemap_English.htm     the cap't.  
714236,Rod Caster,2012-07-13 12:19:00,5784,"well, that changes my tactics. I'll be swapping out my single element stove for a double... no sausages on the fire for me."
714255,NAW,2012-07-13 12:54:00,4022,The radio (The Dock)said there is a fire ban in my area too.  Sprintwater Township..
714256,Christopheraaron,2012-07-13 12:57:00,3525,Does that mean no fire in algnquin then?
714257,bushart,2012-07-13 13:01:00,2628,It's probably the worst drought I've experienced in 50 plus years---even had a brush fire outside Ottawa yesterday  Good if your a holiday'n sun worshipper-----but the farmers really need rain soon
714258,woodenboater,2012-07-13 13:06:00,2277,Well there are a couple of fires in the Kawarthas so would think the Park is probably under a similar ban.
714266,bow slayer,2012-07-13 13:39:00,1074,from the government website it is north of the French river and north of the Mattawa river. Here is a map of ban area....Algonquin is ok.  http://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fire/interactivemap/RFZ/map.html
714286,lew,2012-07-13 14:24:00,12766, Where abouts ??
714287,Roy,2012-07-13 14:29:00,13728,The 2 lower flags on the map are Bancroft area fires.
714295,woodenboater,2012-07-13 15:02:00,2277,"sorry, was looking at it on an iPhone so not super accurate and the site was slow. Seems like one fire is southeast of Chandos Lake and the other close to Limerick. Scary is that one burn is basically on the French River just south of the North Channel.  Hope everyone heading out this weekend doesn't get covered in smoke and that the rains forecast for same period, put them out."
714355,ehg,2012-07-13 18:40:00,2666,"Looks like open fires are restricted from just north of Toronto and east of Ottawa for entire province, Algonquin included.  Check out this map. http://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fire/interactivemap/RFZ/map.html"
