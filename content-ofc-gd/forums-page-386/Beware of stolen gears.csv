All the 'good' fishing gears was taken...they did leave the nets and PFD's.  Please be on a lookout for for sale ads on Kijji/craig'slist for the following:  St. Croix Avid spinning rod Shimano Compre baitcaster Shimano Convergence Spinning rod Shimano Curado 201e7 baitcaster Shimano Stradic Ci4 spinning reel Shimano Sahara spinning reel (2)  numerous lures(soft and hard) to list...  I am totally shocked, stunned, and heartbroken....All my fishing gear gone.  This was in the Yonge and Sheppard area...."
714576,Muskieman,2012-07-14 21:38:00,2472,Damn ! Sorry to read that Keeping my eyes open for sure !
714577,lifeisfun,2012-07-14 21:43:00,99,That sucks Insurance?
714579,commie,2012-07-14 21:54:00,29,  I didn't keep copies of my receipts.....not sure how strict Co-Operators are with proving ownership of the content?
714583,kickingfrog,2012-07-14 22:12:00,8333,Does wishing that the theaf falls overboard make me bad person?
714586,woodenboater,2012-07-14 22:23:00,2277,nope. I would have less charitable thoughts myself. wonder if insurance company's would accept photographs of equipment ?
714595,Christopheraaron,2012-07-14 23:05:00,3525,"I doubt it but I guess you could try, maybe you could get others who saw the equipment to defend? Maybe some day somehow one of those cape cod sharks could make it into his bathtub.  Really feel for you, especially with that kind of gear"
714598,SlowPoke,2012-07-14 23:45:00,2984,"You won't need receipts for your gear.  Your insurance company might balk if you were to claim; Honas Wagner rookie card Hope Diamond 200"" Plasma TV McIntosh audio system with B&W Nautilus speakers Autographed copy of the Bible  Although your gear isn't cheap, it's certainly plausible that a fisherman would own such gear. Sorry about your loss. Take advantage of the opportunity to reassess your setups (rod & reel matching)"
714606,Grimace,2012-07-15 00:33:00,2020,"  My father and I had a pile of gear stolen out of our boat about 5 years ago.  We have insurance with co-operators.  Same thing as you, no receipts.  The lady at Co-Operators told my Dad to replace everything and send in the bill.  They covered it all no questions asked, it was a about $1500 dollars.  Hopefully your Co-Operators branch is as good to you as the Guelph branch was to us.  My parents have all of their insurance through them so that may have had some say in the decision.  Sorry to hear about your gear."
714612,lifeisfun,2012-07-15 01:14:00,99,You can also try to find some pictures of your stuff and if purchased using CC there shouldn't be problem find copies of statements.
714617,Canuck2fan,2012-07-15 02:01:00,1444,"I hope they fall overboard with about 50lb of lead tied to each limb but that is just me... Bad or not it would be karma in my book.  It really sucks that people would do that. I took one of the closets in my apartment and ""converted"" it to a fishing storage room because there was NO WAY I was going to have my gear in my storage locker, which is sort of an open slat design where everything is visible. Over the years it has been broken into 3 times. All they got was a bike with flat tires, and one seriously bent rim but they still took it LOL. The best was I had all the boxes for my electronics but filled with crap from cleaning up after I moved. They really helped me out by taking those too... Animals.  For insurance let us know if they don't replace everything. I just switched companies and forgot to send them my list of contents which I will now do... So your situation helped me by reminding me to to that."

714653,mercman,2012-07-15 12:35:00,7054, This made me choke in my coffee  Your insurance company should be up on all the latest fishing/hunting gear since it is common to have these things stolen.
