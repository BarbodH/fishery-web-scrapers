714640,lew,2012-07-15 11:08:00,12766,"Morning boys  I have a problem with Photobucket and wonder if it happens to anyone else or perhaps you know what causes it.  I use Google's Picassa program to edit my pictures and they come out pretty decent and sharp, but when I email them to my Photobucket account they lose their sharpness and almost become blurry.  When I initially download the pictures from my camera to ""My Pictures"" file their OK and then get better after editing so that part seems alright.  The problem seems to happen only after they go to Photobucket.  I used to use a software called Image Mixer and never had a problem but don't have that anymore.  My camera is a basic Cannon Power Shot A720IS with 8 MP and I've tried different settings but nothing seems to help.  Here's a sample of the problem.  It's a picture of my house that I took yesterday and after editing it was very sharp and crisp but this is what it looks like after it gets to Photobucket.  Anyone have any thoughts ??  "

714647,lew,2012-07-15 11:59:00,12766,"Thanks guys, that seems to have helped.  Funny thing is I don't ever remember changing it to the wrong setting before.  Much appreciated.  "
714648,woodenboater,2012-07-15 12:03:00,2277,What size file are you uploading Lew ? Could be that PB is downsizing them which could result in poor rez. Extreme compression usually results in jaggies (stepping of pixels that's very noticeable).  Is this a recent problem with Photobucket ?
714651,lew,2012-07-15 12:18:00,12766,I believe those last ones were 1600 x 1200 but I've been trying different things to fix the problem.
714660,Twocoda,2012-07-15 13:25:00,4130,I dont know...looks like the lawn needs water in both the pics... Lew make sure you save the photo on your comp after editing and upload the edited one?  BTW nice place
714664,lew,2012-07-15 13:44:00,12766,"Yes, when the pics are edited in Picasa they are saved back to ""my pictures""  As for the brown spots on the grass, I was hoping the sharper images would take care of that...obviously I was wrong"
714676,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-15 14:44:00,10439,Photobucket automatically resizes to 800 pixels on the longest side. I resize before uploading so PB resizing doesn't happen.  Took these shots at The Northern Skies Airshow yesterday.
