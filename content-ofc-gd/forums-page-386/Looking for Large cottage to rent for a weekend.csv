714816,Default User,2012-07-16 01:07:00,72,"Wondering if anybody has any leads to any waterfront cottages available for rent for large families for weekends (3-nights), within 1.5hrs of the GTA  The cottage needs to sleep 7 adults and 3 kids. Preferably at least 3-4 bedrooms. As well a bathroom (or 2) equipped for my 6-months pregnant wife and 5-year old daughter that are true city slickers  Most places I see are 1-week minimum, or have tiny stand-up shower.  My retired parents would love To take their grandchildren out of the city. And I would love to take fishing.  So hoping some of you have any leads, please let me know.  Thanks - Eric"
