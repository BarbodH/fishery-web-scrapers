714411,UglyBug,2012-07-13 22:32:00,148,I have been wearing my Columbia PFG shirts and pants. I figured I would go pant less but keep the shirt on

714435,woodenboater,2012-07-14 00:38:00,2277,and don't forget the bug dope. The deer flies just love to follow you out into the middle of the lake whereupon they'll get their ounce of flesh
714437,spincast,2012-07-14 00:43:00,3279,"bimini up, ice water in the cooler sunscreen hat dipped in the lake and dumped on the head approx once an hour . bright coloured lures oh, and of course - the killer watermelon spoon after 10:00 am 50ft down, 75 back."

714455,Toad Hunter,2012-07-14 07:53:00,261,"Great advice, I think only way anyone learns is the hard way lol. Another thing I keep in the ""tool box"" , that my buddies razz me about regularly, is chap stick (tastes better than sun screen and well the mrs likes it lol"
714458,mike rousseau,2012-07-14 09:53:00,4661,These are the days to support any waterfront restaurants... Get out of the sun for an hour or so.. Works wonders....  Chapstick with SPF  Loads of water... 4 liters per person is my regular... On ice is best...  SPF 30 sunblock... Any higher just gives false security and you won't apply as often as you should... SPF 60 isn't 2x as strong as SPF 30...  Snacks like watermelon to get more fluids...  And some big walleyes help too...lol   Oh yeah...  Coffee... Pop... Redbull... Beer... Doesn't help for hydration... Most actual make it worse...    ...
