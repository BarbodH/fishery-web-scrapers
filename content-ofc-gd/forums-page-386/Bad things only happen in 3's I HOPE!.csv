713870,HTHM,2012-07-11 22:14:00,4082,"My Ford E 150 lasted me till 352,000 sold it for $6000 and it is still going strong at 423,000"
713874,danc,2012-07-11 22:29:00,4677, My 96 F-150 has never been back to the dealership. Neither has my 01 60 HP Merc. Both are still going strong. Maybe I'm missing something here?
713885,blaque,2012-07-11 23:37:00,2419,"I gotta say.....I've owned two f150's before this one and I often boasted the same thing. I drove them off the lot, and they never saw the dealership until I traded in. This ones been a bear. I've looked at the tundra a couple times and it's a nice vehicle. Hasn't won me over I guess"
713898,strik,2012-07-12 00:45:00,175,just picked up a 01 ford f150 only 148  on it 4x4  truck was dealer maintained  everything that the book said the truck got    popped a spark plug  out of the engine   wondering if i made the right choice
714046,Billy Bob,2012-07-12 18:37:00,5865, Those years Ford trucks had a lot of trouble with spark plugs popping like pop corn so it just wasn't your truck....still not good news for someone that just purchased a vehicle....
714269,bassassin,2012-07-13 13:43:00,152,You have a puppy a boat and a cottage! tough life buddy!
714275,Live2fish85,2012-07-13 13:54:00,1633,My old man had a 02 CRV had 493 000km. All that was needed was breaks and oil changes. I understand supporting the economy but I would rather support my wallet.  Don't over look imports.

714279,Raf,2012-07-13 14:01:00,3495, old CRV was built in the US.  2012+ CRVs are built in Ontario (Alliston) as far as I know.  The metal used to build is likely stamped in Ontario (Barrie) too.  You're likely helping an OFNer by buying one.
714282,Live2fish85,2012-07-13 14:09:00,1633,"I know, many other people still don't agree with it though lol. If you work for them to you are less likely to lose your job lol.  They aren't union so do the job right and you got a job, if not goodbye. Union work half assed and you still got the job."
714344,misfish,2012-07-13 18:15:00,29133,"  Yep We stamp parts,ship to two local plants,which assemble,then ships to Honda in Alliston. It,s crazy busy right now again."
713776,RangerGuy,2012-07-11 17:58:00,564,"What a week last week.   1) Wednesday we had a busted gas line infront of my office. Can't get my car till 5:30. RESULT: A) I loose a training session with my pup at a crucial time. Miss getting to West Marine for some supplies to finishing rigging the boat for the weekend.  2) On the way home from training Thursday night.. somebody cause a huge accident on the 400 & 89, means I'm stuck on the 400 for 2.5 hours.  3) Friday on the way to the cottage..I blow my brakes in my truck with the new boat on the back  ARGH!!.. Turns out I have 3000+ in repairs to do with my truck and there really is no point since it's sooo old..and clearly ready to retire. We wanted 2 more years out of her  So now I have a new boat in the drive way and nothing to tow it with! I've had this truck for 6 yrs with no issues that were making it unreliable..but it needs tires, leaf springs and I find that the front end is shot as well as it needs a full replacement of brakes.  Hope this week turns out better HAHA!"
713781,Lip-ripper,2012-07-11 18:13:00,228,1) At least you didn't get hurt from the broken gas line! 2) At least you didn't get hurt from being in the accident! 3) At least you didn't get hurt from not being able to stop your fully loaded rig!  p.s. was it a Dodge? lol
713782,RangerGuy,2012-07-11 18:16:00,564,Yup look all things could have turned out much worse LOL!..  Nope it's a 1990 Chev Pickup.. break downs are/were expected but it's been so long since anything has gone wrong with her I kind over trusted it HAHA!  Oh well.. truck shoping now
713787,misfish,2012-07-11 18:32:00,29133,"A Chevy you say,,,,,,,,,,Hear that Tybo  Your alive,all that matters.  Now head to your local Ford dealer,and buy a REAL truck."
713788,cityfisher,2012-07-11 18:33:00,959,1990!! I think you got your money worth.. Enjoy Truck shopping!
713791,Squid,2012-07-11 18:36:00,1656,"  Sure Brian, like a FORD is going to last 20+ yrs LOL"
713792,misfish,2012-07-11 18:37:00,29133," My F150 is a 97,owes me nothing. If it gets me til spring,I,ll be happy.New one will be coming then. I see Ford has brought back the Hunter Green color."
713795,RangerGuy,2012-07-11 18:41:00,564,Yup and I was the second owner.. nothing like a big block 350 with a 5 speed... HAHAH! 600+ on the body and frame.
713797,mercman,2012-07-11 18:45:00,7054,3000 smackers for breaks ??? That sounds a wee bit steep:dunno: What part of the break system could cost that much?
713801,davey buoy,2012-07-11 18:49:00,5505, Or a 1999 explorer with 392km's and still pulls my boat weekly in the summer season at 3000lb's I will add.GO FORD LOL.
713807,misfish,2012-07-11 18:55:00,29133, And takes you to where theres no steelhead.
713810,davey buoy,2012-07-11 19:01:00,5505,  Yes your right!!
713811,RangerGuy,2012-07-11 19:03:00,564,"No 3000+ for all needed repairs, innner/outer tie rod ends,ball joints, pitman arm, steel brake lines ,front & back parts.  This is before the normal stuff like like tires, u-joints and leafs (which I was planning to do shortly haha!)  Oh well..she's been a good truck and I'll miss her!"
713818,blaque,2012-07-11 19:32:00,2419,"Ford??  2010 Ford F-150 Supercrew  So Far:  Ticking sensor somewhere in the motor that bugs the heck out of me (ford says its normal)  Replaced clutch packs near the driveshaft, differential link. Felt like i was driving over rumble strips when accelerating from a stop  And ill be taking it in again for the third time for a stalling issue. Along with this my gas gauge stops working. Twice ford couldnt fix it  Ive been in f-150s for 8 years now..........this one has me seriously questioning what ill be getting into next"
713821,misfish,2012-07-11 19:42:00,29133,  Made on a Monday (AFTER THE WEEKEND) or Friday (AFTER PAY DAY)?LOL
713828,blaque,2012-07-11 20:11:00,2419," That only leaves 3 more days in the work week to make a truck that works  So ur saying i only get a 60% chance to get a truck that works. If thats the case ill go back to what i did in my younger days, and buy disposable $200 dollar chevettes and scrap em when its time for another one"
713829,davey buoy,2012-07-11 20:14:00,5505," Try and find one now?There's one in the city,original owner,less than 100km,mint:D Not for sale,apparently people ask him quite often if he would sell it.Imagine:whistling:"
713833,misfish,2012-07-11 20:28:00,29133," LMAO I owned one.Never said never.Or is that never,never? LOL"

713845,blaque,2012-07-11 20:57:00,2419," Yep, there all but gone now.......I had a couple with standard trannies that i would beat the living snot out of and couldnt kill em. We even ""braced"" the body of a buddy of mines chevette and chopped the top off and made it a ""convertible"" lol. Actually i think that one was the pontiac version, the T1000 i believe they were called, or for you guys up in Canada......the Acadian. Those were the days"
713851,Handlebarz,2012-07-11 21:09:00,3790,Just saw a chevette today in Ohio it was in good shape and passed me doing about 115 it was moving.  As for parts we get hosed here in Ontario on them I buy most parts in Ohio usually 1/2 price from here. Starter for f150 here $100+tax for rebuilt 1 year warranty there $25 +tax or $50 life time warranty.  Chev 1500 exhaust from cats back $600 here $150 there what gives? I just got my office worker breaks for her chev truck not sure of modle but it's huge for pulling her horse trailer  around $2500 + tax here $1200 out the door down there.
713856,Billy Bob,2012-07-11 21:16:00,5865," When your ready head down the West Herr Toyota and get yourself a nice TUNDRA......this is 100% the truth.....mine is now 5 years and 1 month old....never had to go back to the dealer except for a tire sensor calibration after FIRESTONE broke it while putting on new tires......I have had Fords, Chevy's and GMC trucks.......NOTHING comes close to the quality of this Toyota Tundra...."
