714477,Lunker777,2012-07-14 13:23:00,866,Hey guys .... I'm about to drive roughly 7 hours north with the boat and I wasn't sure if I should take the minn Kota off or if I should just strap the head down and take off ? It would take a bit of work to get it off ....  Thanks !
714481,HTHM,2012-07-14 13:34:00,4082,If it a bow mount just strap it down.
714486,NBR,2012-07-14 13:45:00,163,"I keep it unplugged, strapped down and have driven 1,000 miles each way with no problems!"
714491,Sinker,2012-07-14 13:53:00,8692,"Ya, you have nothing to worry about. They're pretty tough.  S."
714492,Lunker777,2012-07-14 13:53:00,866,"If i put a little torque on the shaft of the terrova, it won't hurt anything right ? I have put a bungee strap on it and it works pretty good !"
714500,Live2fish85,2012-07-14 14:14:00,1633,You will be fine. Have drove long ways with them on. Plus think the abuse it goes through when your moving out on the lake and hitting waves.
714503,scugpg,2012-07-14 14:47:00,1373,I usually take mine off on long trips
714510,Rich Clemens,2012-07-14 15:27:00,3131,Same here.   I just let it on.  Never had a problem.
714513,taper,2012-07-14 15:36:00,611,You wont hurt it by a little tension with a bungee. I have seen me drift up against a rock at the French while fighting a fish and make the shaft look like a bow (not recommended). They will flex quite a bit.
714517,SlowPoke,2012-07-14 16:00:00,2984,"If you're going to leave it on the boat, it might be better to let it bounce a little. In my opinion, the shock of having it tightly secured is probably more harsh on the circuitry than having the head bounce a little bit."
