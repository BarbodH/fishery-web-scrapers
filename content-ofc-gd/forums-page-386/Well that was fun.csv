So I launched the boat at 3 am  this morning  ran down he lake to a few of my honey holes and bam, I smoked them today. 10 fish landed 2 were giant small mouths  which totally surprised me since I have never in 19 years fishing that spot caught them there. I also tried a few different combinations of my tried and true lure and discovered a new combo""! Which shall remain nameless    fish shut  down at 9, so I got some seat time in the Ranger. I have her dialed in perfectly now. Full tournament  load and I was hitting 61.4 gps which is about all she will do. I also messed with he PVS plugs on he prop and shaved a whopping 5 seconds off the hole shot, went from 8' to 3 seconds every single time    raised jack plate 1/8 inch, and WOT went to 5700 max rate is 5750 so the arse is out of her now.,  Oh and every single fish was released today, I usually keep them but decided to catch and release. Maybe that's why i did well today"

714533,UglyBug,2012-07-14 17:02:00,148,"Ok but what music goes with fish porn. Hum let me look to see what I can find   when I left the water it was so hot that the coffee in my thermos tasted  like ice tea. Wow. Oh forgot to mention when I go to my truck To load the boat some   had parked their little car so close to me I could not make the turn to get around the parking barrier. So I went into the marina to ask, they told me they did not know who it belonged to but should not be there soo   I had to drop my trailer and clear the way..... I always have a 10000 lb tow strap in the truck. Let's just say the car is not where they parked it..   don't mess with the Irish "
