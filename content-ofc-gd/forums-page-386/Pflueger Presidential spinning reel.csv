714312,icefisherman,2012-07-13 16:16:00,952,"I see the Pflueger Presidential spinning reel on sale this week at CT for $49.99 ($30 off). It is a great reel and I already have one but maybe getting a second one. Can't remember what was the price last time. So wanted to ask you if the $49.99 is a good one compared to past CT sales?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
714313,Live2fish85,2012-07-13 16:23:00,1633,"That""s a good price but it is only $20.00 off from most tackle shops. They usually go for $69.99."
714334,Cosmos,2012-07-13 17:47:00,588,I am using that one fron CT for last 2 years. Pretty good reel for this price.
714341,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-13 18:01:00,2690,"If you do a quick Ebay search you will find this sale price compares to the regular price in the US...throw on $6.50 in tax to balance out shipping.  Works out to an okay deal, plus if something does go wrong with it CT, for the most part, is quick and easy to deal with. Still one of the best bangs for under $100."
714362,fish_fishburn,2012-07-13 19:06:00,1311,"Was in the Pembroke store this morning at 10:00am and they didnt have any in stock. The supervisor told me they only had one and it was already sold. He told me he could do a rain check for me and asked if there was anything else he could help me with. I told him I just drove 20 miles to pick up the reel and some other fishing gear but I think I will take my business some place else. Why do these idiots advertise something and then when you go there they don't have the goods? I was going to call first because this has happenend to me many times before, but since it is fishing week and all i figured they would be stalked up."
714482,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 13:35:00,5865,"Great reel, especially for that price.....got one for son on his birthday about 3 years ago......SMOOTH with those 9 ball bearings....."
714497,jedimaster,2012-07-14 14:07:00,3472,Bass pro is great for having sales on stuff they don't have in stock.
714554,Dabluz,2012-07-14 19:36:00,701," This happens all the time with Canadian Tire.  Last week, I wanted a life vest that was on sale.  They did not have it in the Chicoutimi store yet it said they had one in the inventory.  I called the store a few days later and talked with the manager and told him that they should have stock on hand when there are sales.  He then told me that the stores sells only about 4 of the expensive type inflateable flotation devices per year.  I said that this is normal because I have only seen the cheaper 120 dollar one since the beginning of the year and that they should have them on display in the spring when fishermen are shopping instead of mid-summer when the weekend fishermen are out buying cheap stuff for a few days of fishing.  Right now, even the choices in coolers is limited.  I live in the middle of the best brook trout fishing in the world and I have to drive 2 1/2 hours to Quebec city to get decent hooks, Panther Martins, 4 lb test line etc etc.  Only a couple of independantly owned boutiques sell decent small spinning reels for trout fishing.  Nobody sells premium quality fishing line.  Sure I can get Power Pro, Fireline, Berkley XL and XT but if I want premium quality line, I have to order some from Europe.  So I order my hooks from there too.  Of course, sales of premium quality items is close to zero....you can't sell what you don't have.  Therefore, most fishermen accept second or third best."
714559,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 19:50:00,5865, One Word...........         CABELA'S
714571,Dabluz,2012-07-14 21:22:00,701, Cabela's has stuff but ships via UPS to Canada which doubles the price of goods.  Nobody in his right mind in Canada will order from Cabela's.
714578,Dan668,2012-07-14 21:45:00,1120,"Tackle warehouse... Ordered 700 dollars of gear. Paid 48 bucks in taxes. Got my package the next day. Not every method of ups kills you. Shipping was dirt cheap  Back to the topic, I bought my dad this reel years ago. No problems to this day. Was 70 when i purchased it"
714580,icefisherman,2012-07-14 21:54:00,952,"OK just bough myself a second one today...nice reel for sure...and price seem OK with this sale.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
714581,Dan668,2012-07-14 21:57:00,1120,Nice. At its price point it's a great reel
714594,Acountdeleted,2012-07-14 23:01:00,2562,Best reel I've ever owned. Match that with a 5'6 Lite ugly stick and I have my go to combo. Highly reccomended here.  Now I just picked up a Rapala R-type and am trying to decide between a 6' Browning Medalion or a 5'2 St. Croix..... legend i think it is. The cheapest St. Croix model. Both medium of course.
714634,chefboi17,2012-07-15 03:25:00,128,"I picked up 2 of these, they seem nice for the price, my only issue is my dad seems to have taken posession of one of them,"
714694,Leecher,2012-07-15 16:43:00,7832," Billy B it's 10 not 9  I received a late birthday gift certificate yesterday for CT and this morning, decided to pick one up.... NICE reel    good quality and smooth  Thanks for posting this thread Emill    Got mine for $30   Now can't wait to try it"
714710,Billy Bob,2012-07-15 18:33:00,5865, I believe Musky Mike orders from Cabela's all the time....I think he knows his way around the UPS shipping expense...but Mike's a veteran angler with these kind of things.....
714711,Billy Bob,2012-07-15 18:34:00,5865, I stand corrected.........and that's even BETTER.....
714763,Grimace,2012-07-15 23:20:00,2020, No you don't.  It has 9 as you stated.  President   9 stainless steel ball bearings (6920 has 7 ball bearings)  Instant anti-reverse one-way clutch bearing  Anodized aluminum spool with distinctive hole pattern for lighter weight  Titanium coated spool lip for added line protection  Large diameter titanium coated line roller  Smooth front drag system with stainless steel and oiled felt washers  Sure-Clickâ„¢ bail  Corrosion-resistant stainless steel main shaft and components  Aluminum handle  Soft touch knob
714768,backbay,2012-07-15 23:31:00,773,"If you can find stock, that's a good price for one of the best bang-for-your-buck spinning reels reels out there."
714829,icefisherman,2012-07-16 01:58:00,952,"  Well actually it says on their web site that reel has a total of 19 bearings:  http://www.pfluegerfishing.com/products/products.php?p=12  9 stainless steel ball bearings  AND One Instant anti-reverse one-way clutch bearing  If you look right under the picture it says ""10 bearing system"" Not that it makes that much of a difference... Anyhow it is a very good reel....having a second one should last me for a while...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
714835,Canuck2fan,2012-07-16 02:25:00,1444," I agree but if don't find stock take the darn rain check and grab one when they come in. I am not a big fan of CTC but in the small town I work in, the local owner will honor rain checks basically forever as a good will gesture. For that reason even if I have to order an item any dollar I spend at CTC gets spent in his store. I all but refuse to shop in the store in my hometown.... too many burnt bridges, so I might buy 10 bucks worth of hooks there a year.  Also, remember CTC will allow you to have a ""hint"" if they might have one by checking for stock availability online. I have never missed getting any item using that feature if it says it is there it has been..."
714855,Kerry,2012-07-16 03:30:00,383, CTC on Mapleview in Barrie had lots today. Kerry
714857,icefisherman,2012-07-16 03:48:00,952,"When I picked up mine yesterday the CT store in Milton had 2 more left.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
