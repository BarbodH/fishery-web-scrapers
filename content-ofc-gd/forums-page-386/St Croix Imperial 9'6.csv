714529,Sharkbait22,2012-07-14 16:49:00,297,"Anders, Why sell it? Sounds like the perfect steelhead nymphing rod.  Also, some of the St.Corix rods can be traded for more upscale models."

714638,singingdog,2012-07-15 10:28:00,1047,$10!! I'll save you the bother of reposting it in the classifieds and take it off your hands right now.
714744,Joeytier,2012-07-15 22:43:00,3990,"I have a 2/3 wt Imperial that I bought used for $ 90, which was on the low side of market value, so I would say at least $ 160 for a 7/8."
714905,johnnyb,2012-07-16 13:21:00,3413,I think you should rub the green/white spoon all over it to increase its value
714916,doubleheader,2012-07-16 13:47:00,497,"I have this same rod in an 8wt, I can't remember what I paid for it, but it is one of my favorite rods for steelies."
