Its a tough job and a big favor to ask but i'm a good buddy so could not refuse a friend in need  We of course had to test the boat while we were there and it performed pretty well during the 2 hour test.    <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/OyGIvzWYfWs"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>               "
