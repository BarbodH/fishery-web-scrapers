I've fished it a bit over the years, but I haven't put in a ton of hours.  Tried tubes and drop-shotting senkos rather than my usual cranks and spinner baits and was rewarded with larger fish than usual, including this 5.1 lb-er (I know, ho-hum on Simcoe, but big for me!).  I also got broken off by a larger one.  Fished alone - I gotta say I LOVE doing that.  Having company is great, for the sake of company, but there's nothing like figuring things out on your own and fishing just the way you want.  Anyway, tight lines all.  MoB  "

Having the company is fun and all - but sometimes just too distracting.  It was nice to be able to just ease back and collect my thoughts, or pack up and move whenever I wanted to."
