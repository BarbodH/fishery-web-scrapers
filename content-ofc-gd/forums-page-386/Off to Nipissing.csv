I've been there many times and do very well for Smallies, Largies and small Pike.  Generally the water depth is between 5-12 feet deep so there aren't any walters around.  Does anyone know of any deep water in that area? The mouth of West Bay is a bit far but I do believe there is a deeper channel there.  Feel free to PM me. I would really appreciate the help.  Report to follow...  Cheers, Laz"

I followed his directions while I motored out as he knew the area and said they're were rocks to watch out for. We didn't get any ""eyes"" but we did get a number of big sheephead."
714475,laszlo,2012-07-14 13:02:00,487, Thanks Spiel. I'm going to check it out.  The south side of the lake in that entire area is awesome scenery wise...no cottages and very little traffic.
714484,Spiel,2012-07-14 13:42:00,9065,"You're welcome.  While Ron and I didn't connect with wallies I'm certain we were in the right area and due to weather we only got out there once over the week.  You have a great trip, be safe."
714493,capt_hooked,2012-07-14 13:54:00,212,On Nipissing's West end.. many walleye can be found in the weedbeds and are often overlooked...  Fish the deeper cabbage... double twister tails.. try all the colours...  Use the wind to drift fish... start about 4pm and fish till the sun goes down..  Spinner and woors.. also work good..  The trick is to be in the deeper cabbage and to be ON THE BOTTOM...!   Also this week some guests caught good walleyes.. trolling the front edges of pencil reeds using spinner and worms... this is in less than six feet of water.. with this heat and mid morning..   good luck...   the cap't....  
714556,cynmar,2012-07-14 19:37:00,169,"Was up in Nipissing this past week, only caught 5 pickeral. Fished from 4' to 35' deep but couldn't get into them. We stayed near Callander Bay , at Deep Bay on the south shore. In fact, the fishing was down over last year. Will post report in next couple of days , just got back. Some pictures and a controversial topic to be sure coming up."

714930,Fish4Eyes,2012-07-16 14:45:00,1022,Why not stay in Noelville where there is an abundance of deep water?
