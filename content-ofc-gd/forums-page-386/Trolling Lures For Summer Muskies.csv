714712,rufus,2012-07-15 18:51:00,267,What are your favourite lures for trolling (not casting) for Muskie in the middle of summer? I know that in the fall jakes and grandmas seems to get the nod but what about in summer?

714717,Handlebarz,2012-07-15 20:34:00,3790,"Woodies hands down here on LSC I have also done well on Cameron lake with them. Yesterday we went 4/6 and 4 of them were on woodies 6 1/4"" and the mini mee. I also use my Handlebarz trolled behind a Kiel weight that keeps the baits from twisting the main line I use steel leaders I find it will not twist like fluorocarbon does.  I also use small jakes 8"" and don't be afraid to run a sledge in or beside the propwash the action on them is killer."
714738,rufus,2012-07-15 22:22:00,267,"A lot of good ideas, thanks guys!"
714740,Pigeontroller,2012-07-15 22:27:00,2793,"Whatever likes being trolled FAST. Spinnerbaits and In-lines, Stalkers, Jakes..."
714789,rufus,2012-07-16 00:24:00,267,I remember watching a TV show decades ago about fishing for Muskie on the Larry. They were trolling so fast they were almost planing. I like the idea of covering lottsa water fast
714795,Handlebarz,2012-07-16 00:44:00,3790,All of our musky we got and had hit yesterday were at 4.4mph-5mph I usually start at 4.5 and go up and down to see what it will take as fast at 7mph
714810,rufus,2012-07-16 00:54:00,267, At 7 mph I better get around to installing that rod holder sitting in my closet or my arm will fall off!
714820,Handlebarz,2012-07-16 01:26:00,3790,You will be surprised what you will get at high speeds. The big girls can move very fast to see what it was that just whizzed by there face. If they are picky make them eat high speed means less time for them to think just get pissed off and eat
714830,rufus,2012-07-16 01:58:00,267,Gotta like that
714876,outllaw,2012-07-16 10:07:00,1232,"summer fish. hi and speeds at 4-5mph. yesterday we caught 5 muskies in a few hours. georgies minnee shads and 6 inch woodies. joints seem better then straights. its me.tabolism. , big fish in a comfort zone love to eat in summer months"
714906,mike rousseau,2012-07-16 13:27:00,4661,"Anything that runs at high speeds...woodies... Stalkers... Jakes... Depth raider...  4-8 mph in the summer...  And run em high... They'll come up most days...  The 48"" I got on Friday my bait was 10 feet down over 22 feet of water...   ..."
714915,rufus,2012-07-16 13:45:00,267,Thanks everyone -  I wanted to explore some new areas this summer and will put your suggestions to good use. I didn't have a great deal of confidence in trolling for muskie in the summer but do now
