714553,lifeisfun,2012-07-14 19:20:00,99,"We had great 2011 fall with Mike (fordson) and  we got spoiled by the numbers caught late last year. This spring was tough for me, got new dog and I did not spent nearly enough time on the water as I would like.      Managed to make some friends happy getting theres personal best this year but me.... ehhhh... I sucked.      Luck started to change 2 weeks ago when I lost nice fish at the boat side since my fishing buddy was traveling with his family to visit mom and dad so he just left me hanging    and couple days ago I was so frustrated that I did not set the hook enough Well, this morning I took wifey for ""boat ride"" and after 20 minutes of boring trolling finally musky gods decided to make my day! Started casting and not too long in to it this nice fish visited my net. This fish was recently caught by another angler (CATCH AND RELEASE WORKS!) and had bunch of lamprey marks on its body. By 9am was gettin very hot so we decided to go back home and that sure made the dog happy  :mrgreen:       "

714561,lew,2012-07-14 20:00:00,12766,Very very nice !!
714562,Rich Clemens,2012-07-14 20:06:00,3131,That's a great one.   Congrats
714566,Musky or Specks,2012-07-14 20:45:00,2710,Very nice fish!!
714567,Handlebarz,2012-07-14 20:47:00,3790,Great story congrats on working hard to get her
714569,lifeisfun,2012-07-14 20:57:00,99,"I sure did, thanks guys Good luck on the water everyone!"
714641,rufus,2012-07-15 11:23:00,267,Beauty! Nice to see that muskie was still back in the game after having been caught previously.
714642,Roy,2012-07-15 11:38:00,13728,A really nice fish. Congrats to you and thanks for putting her back. Those lesions don't appear to be lamprey related.
714644,spincast,2012-07-15 11:42:00,3279,congrats - nice reward for your efforts  
714649,captpierre,2012-07-15 12:06:00,2521,She's gotta me mad at herself for being fooled again.  Will likely blame her man
714652,mercman,2012-07-15 12:29:00,7054,"Great Ski !!! I was looking for that yesterday, found walleye instead....Oh Well..."
714655,lifeisfun,2012-07-15 13:04:00,99,"I don't know, but since they were circular and many of them on her back already healed I thought lampreys. In the area where I fish it's very unusual to catch fish fithout lamprey attached this time of the year. Some of them are up to 10 inches long"
714657,lifeisfun,2012-07-15 13:06:00,99,"Hey, every time I catch walleye on musky size bait it's trophy fish so I'll take that before being skunked"
714658,lifeisfun,2012-07-15 13:08:00,99,"Yeah, the area around her mouth was healing fine, I just wonder howlong it takes for the rip in her mouth to seal. It was close to 2"" long but not infected."
714662,Twocoda,2012-07-15 13:39:00,4130,Now that is kicking arse in a serious way....nice shootin!
714687,tb4me,2012-07-15 15:36:00,3295,nice fish! I can only wish for one of those beasts one of these days
714691,lifeisfun,2012-07-15 15:49:00,99,"It will happen, just don't loose patience and stick with it!"
