After lunch we headed out for an hour fishing while our wives and kids played at the beach.                    Garnet went home and about 3pm my buddy Cliff showed up to pitch tent too. We set up camp and the shenanigans began               After camp was ready it was time for a swim and some tubing                         As the sun set, we dried off the kids, dropped the crew at the dock and Cliff and me headed out fishing for an hour. We skunked but had some laughs.              At about 11pm all the kids were still up so we decided to take them on a crayfish hunt....BIG HIT!                             Although tired, I was determined to avenge the skunk....Cliff and me were up at 4:30am and headed out fishing......we scored some nice walleye a bunch of ling and some trout and were back at camp at 9:30 am                 Sunday morning was a quick trip across our bay to the Annual Teddy Bear Picnic                                         Jack and mum went for a nap around 2pm and I took advantage of a beautiful afternoon and went out for a session on our lake                 When Jack got up, mum went to work and we took off in the boat together for the evening                                    The next evening Jack wanted to show mum the pelicans....no pelicans but we caught a few small walleye and had a nice cruise around the bay                              What a great long weekend we had last week.    This weekend i'm travelling down to Erieau. Cant wait to head out with Spincast and maybe bump into a few people i know at the Fish-a-Thon.   Till next time.......    Tight lines!      oh....here are the vids from the weekend. Sorry....i swear in the second video at 1:38.    <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/BvxAJgYnPzk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>     <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/0rHjYlDTzok"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>    <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/XLfNhX1eupY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
