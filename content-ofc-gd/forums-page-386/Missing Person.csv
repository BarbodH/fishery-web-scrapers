He suffers from depression and there is some concern that he may have come to harm.  He dissappered last Tuesday and the family has asked that we spread the word.  One theory to his whereabouts is that he may have gone off to ""get away"" from it all. A green clearwater kayak is missing from the family cottage in Haliburton.  As you are out and about please keep an eye out and if you could check for his vehicles at put ins etc. it would be appreciated.  I will monitor this post and answer any questions if I can. If you see or find anything please contact the Toronto Police at the Numbers below.  Thanks for your help in this matter and I will keep it updated if there are any developments.  Mods if this is considered inappropriate please pull the thread.  Please see the release and photo below.

91144,carp-starter,2007-07-05 20:36:00,253,"Nemo  If you want to, send me a PM with an e-mail address. I will then send to you my e-mail address - you will be able to send the PIC to this e-mail address. I will change the PIC from BMP format to Jpeg and return it to you.  Or you can do it yourself very easily by using PAINT.  - right click on the image and select PAINT in OPEN WITH.  - click on file and then click on SAVE AS.  - on SAVE AS TYPE line, change the format of PIC to JPEG and then click - save.  - you now should have a JPEG PIC.  Good luck in changing the format and I hope the missing man is found soon.  carp-starter  PS - if the size of the pic is required, this will be the time to do it using paint and -Image, Stretch.Skew - just decrease the horizontal and verticle lenght."
