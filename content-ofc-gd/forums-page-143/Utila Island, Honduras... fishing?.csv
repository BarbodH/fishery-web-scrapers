I hear they have bonefish, permit, grouper, snappers... even tarpon in the shallows and lagoons. Any tips on lures or live bait?"
951263,captpierre,2015-12-31 03:26:00,2521,"Can't go wrong with heavy line, 1-2 oz pyramid weights, assortment of larger hooks. Dropshot with any meat you can find.  Maybe smaller stuff to catch bait."
