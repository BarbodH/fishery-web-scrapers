951446,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-01 17:45:00,8243,"You are a special guy Bunk. Thanks for sharing not just the fishing exploits but your most interesting life. Of all the pics I have to say my favorite is of the staff and yourself at the hospital. It says ""this is Canada"" in so many ways.  Happy New Year to you and yours."
951455,Fisherpete,2016-01-01 18:16:00,1814,"Happy new year Bunk - glad to hear that you have been able to take control of your time. I made a big career change just over two years ago, reclaiming my weekends and overall quality of life back and it was the best thing I have ever done. As for the fishing pics... you just make it look so easy. I bet if you went after a yellow perch on a whim you would end up with a 4 pounder.  Cheers Pete"

951499,Ralph Field,2016-01-02 01:03:00,1018,What a detailed report. Thanks for sharing.
951517,Steelheadphycho,2016-01-02 05:08:00,470,"It truly boggles the mind to think you accomplished all that in a year. Even in two years, that would be a feat! I couldn't do all that in a decade!!! Mr. Blizzard's clever reply says it all precisely. Your contributions to this board are incredible! Congratulations on a stellar year, and all the best to you and your family in the coming year!  Thank you!"
951521,fishindevil,2016-01-02 10:50:00,6254,"Wow !!! You are a busy man drew !!!! Amazing reports & pics and real life stories !!!!! Some amazing fishing adventures too !!! Thanks for sharing & keep em coming when I don't see a report from you for a while I always wonder ""where is he now & what is he fishing for "" !!!!!! Cheers & happy new year all the best in 2016"
951523,Fish Farmer,2016-01-02 13:20:00,2234,"Gezz Bunk, you should start your own Fishing Show. We don't see such a show on TV. Thanks for sharing and the hard work you put in making such a great post."
951525,wkrp,2016-01-02 14:15:00,656,Thanks for another fabulous report bunk.
951526,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-02 14:24:00,937,Wow!  All that in one year?  My fav was the Gar posts... thanks for sharing.
951530,NewHips,2016-01-02 14:45:00,111,Another amazing report......Your writing and pictures are second to none. Wishing You and your family the best in 2016.  :clapping:
951531,Moosebunk,2016-01-02 14:51:00,3970,"You Mr Bunk are a wizard p.s.  I am a little partial to the mermaid ice fishing pic, pm me as to where that lake is lol  What's weird John is that I've been called a wizard several times before by other anglers and friends.  Gonna have to buy a Merlin hat for future reports.  Thanks again bud and, no I can't tell you where those mermaids swim.  I made a big career change just over two years ago, reclaiming my weekends and overall quality of life back and it was the best thing I have ever done. Pete  It's worked for you Pete cause the last few years the muskie reports just keep coming and coming, and I bet that weekend play time makes work go a little easier mon to fri.  Of all the pics I have to say my favorite is of the staff and yourself at the hospital. It says ""this is Canada"" in so many ways.  It kinda of does you know!  Any workforce I've been a part of through 20 years in healthcare has always been a collection of unique peoples with many different backgrounds that, always come together and do the best they know how in order make a difference and help others. That is Canada today.  when I don't see a report from you for a while I always wonder ""where is he now & what is he fishing for  I think the same with Mikey some days...    There will be times now with work that'll force me offline for periods of weeks. During then it should give plenty chance to get caught up on any fishing reports.  I also need to ask this spring if someone web savvy can help me get a site up and going.  There has to be a hundred stories saved now and I'd like to archive that somewhere.  That will cut into some time too.  Gezz Bunk, you should start your own Fishing Show.  We don't see such a show on TV.   That'd be fun in many ways... but on video I seem like such a dork.  Probably cause I am.    I agree 100% with Roy when he said it best in his New Years post...  A great 2016 to all of your families and friends. There will be bumps in the road for some this year as there is every year but I'm confident that our community will pull together and try to smooth those bumps. That's the great part of this community that I'm a proud member of.  The important thing to remember is that we must try to stay healthy and happy....anything else you may want will fall into place.  Thanks everyone for letting me be a small part of it. Be well, all of you.  ps. Don't forget, fishing is still our raison d'Ãªtre.  ... and emphasize again that one must stay healthy and happy as, everything else will fall into place. This Community actually helps many people with that in many different ways.  From the common bond of fishing, through to supporting someone during difficult times, to just giving a member a pat on the back for a coffee table well built out of pallets, we are more fortunate to have this place than to not have it. And, it's a cool thing to be a part of, and best done so in a positive way.  So like Roy, I'm proud to be here for that, and thank any and all the good people who share, support, participate and even just belong to OFC with good and honest intentions.  Gotta get a morning coffee now.  Laterski doods!"
