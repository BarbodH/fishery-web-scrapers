951429,Moosebunk,2016-01-01 16:31:00,3970,"""A"" for effort guys!"
951430,Acountdeleted,2016-01-01 16:32:00,2562,"I'm still jealous that you two got to do that, so that's saying something."
951431,Rod Caster,2016-01-01 16:33:00,5784,"Yep, that's pretty sad Jer, hahaha. Are the lakes completely open in your area?"
951451,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-01 17:58:00,8243,Who needs ice when you have open water? I know it's just not the same. Nothing like coming into the hut for a hot bowl of Chile and a cold pop. I had the hardwater bug for many years and I get it. Good effort boys.
951452,misfish,2016-01-01 18:01:00,29133,"Last pic is priceless.  I wish we had that here. Would of been out on open water, if not for the wind."
951507,NAW,2016-01-02 02:21:00,4022,"I went up and checked the progress today with Sam.  if not for the snow, you could have launched a boat there.  Just a skim or shore ice on some back bays.  To say I am disappointed is an understatement!  Nice day for a drive with my girlfriend at least."
951508,CRAPPIE,2016-01-02 02:45:00,213,This kind of shore open water-ice fishing allow to use 2 rods or not?
951510,Joeytier,2016-01-02 03:03:00,3990,Give me a break haha
951568,Acountdeleted,2016-01-02 19:42:00,2562,Yep. And I can't really get out on a kayak. Kinda risky biz.
951588,Toronto_Angler,2016-01-02 21:28:00,698,Lol!
951605,chris.brock,2016-01-02 23:21:00,4053,Beats sitting at home!!  Exactly!  I saw a lot of people sitting around over the holidays.  Looks like the snow is going to bugger up the ice making up there.  Looks like a fun day to me.
