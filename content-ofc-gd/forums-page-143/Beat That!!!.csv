951891,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-05 01:57:00,10439,"So I left Southern Ontario at 11 AM local time (9 AM Yellowknife time) and pulled into my drive way just after midnight (YK time) last night.  A total of 63 hours from the time I left to the time I got home. 48 of those hours were behind the wheel tooling down the road.  Total mileage is right around 5,500 kms.  I don't go back to work until Thursday, so I still have a couple more days to recoup!!"
951892,chris.brock,2016-01-05 02:01:00,4053,Good run. Maybe check your timing belt while you have a couple of days off.
951895,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-05 02:10:00,10439,"Good run. Maybe check your timing belt while you have a couple of days off.  It's under warranty now, thanks to Honda in Guelph."
951901,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-05 02:48:00,956,So how many times did you hit Horton's on the way home bud?
951904,Dara,2016-01-05 02:58:00,3052,Thats unreal...is there a reason you don't fly?
951905,Raf,2016-01-05 03:02:00,3495,average speed of 114 km/hr... that's impressive.
951913,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-05 03:54:00,10439,So how many times did you hit Horton's on the way home bud?  Once!!! Needed bagels. Tried their attempt @ espresso. Ended up dumping it out. Tasted like they used shredded used coffee filters that were soaked in turpentine before pressing the swill they call coffee out.
951914,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-05 03:56:00,10439,"Thats unreal...is there a reason you don't fly?  Had to bring back stuff that my pop had for me. Tools and such. Also had to bring back a table for a friend, plus during Christmas break airlines don't let you bring your pooch."
951915,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-05 03:59:00,10439,average speed of 114 km/hr... that's impressive.  Speed limit is mostly 110 kph once you leave Ontario. Can easily cruise 125-127 kph and not get ticketed. Did have several cops give me the warning flash though.
951916,Dara,2016-01-05 04:01:00,3052,"Ok, my daughter had to find a sitter for her pooch or fly it a month ahead.  Is the fishing any good there in Feb...she has me considering a trip  PS, thats still a crazy drive"
951917,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-05 04:07:00,10439,If you like ice fishing and drilling through 3 to 4 feet of ice it is.
951918,Dara,2016-01-05 04:12:00,3052,I love ice fishing..power auger
951921,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-05 04:17:00,10439,"I love ice fishing..power auger  I know people that use had augers, but they ain't right in the head!!!"
951931,wormdunker,2016-01-05 09:41:00,1711,That's one hell of a long time behind the wheel of a truck!  What was your fuel bill?
951934,misfish,2016-01-05 12:03:00,29133,"Well we never did get to hook up, but that's cool. You were a busy guy. Glad your made it here and back safely.  Not right in the head eh? Is that like, it,s your island?  Looking forward to your ice adventures.  Stay safe  B"
951949,Sinker,2016-01-05 14:10:00,8692,Nice run. I love a good road trip!  S.
951950,Acountdeleted,2016-01-05 14:33:00,2562, Speed limit is mostly 110 kph once you leave Ontario. Can easily cruise 125-127 kph and not get ticketed. Did have several cops give me the warning flash though.   Whats the 'warning flash'?  My claim to fame used to be Toronto to Thunder Bay in 15 hours (I'd come home on long weekends). And Toronto to Edmonton in 60 hours. That was also with getting slowed down with blowing a tire 100km outside of Winnipeg on the second day.
951952,Gallie,2016-01-05 14:49:00,1215,"Nice trip, glad you made it in one piece! Man do i love the warning flash, thank you sir!"
951957,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-05 15:42:00,10439,  Whats the 'warning flash'?  â€‹Cops will sometimes flash their flashing lights at you to let you know you are speeding but just below the threshold of being pulled over and fined.
951969,misfish,2016-01-05 16:38:00,29133,"It,s more like, It,s tooo frigg,n cold for me to get out of my warm seat. If you don't heed my warning though, you,ll pay dearly for making me come out there. LOL"
