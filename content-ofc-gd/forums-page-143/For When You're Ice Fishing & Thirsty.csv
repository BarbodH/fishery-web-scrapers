952023,chris.brock,2016-01-06 00:42:00,4053,Drinking while on the ice or on the water is irresponsible.

952037,smitty55,2016-01-06 03:05:00,928,Drinking while on the ice or on the water is irresponsible. If you're not driving what's the big deal. It's always been done.

952205,manitoubass2,2016-01-07 17:15:00,11391,???  Chris comin through with the goods?
952226,AKRISONER,2016-01-07 19:20:00,5558,just saying that the boys and I have had the idea to start a food truck/barbecue spot on simcoe. Imagine how much money could be made?! As always licensing and regulation would be the limitation. but any of you can try tell me that the smell of ribs and burgers wouldnt lure you from your tent/hut but i know youd be lying.  every time we have a barbecue out on the ice you always have people walk over telling you how good it smells.
952249,SirCranksalot,2016-01-07 22:35:00,3291,If you're not driving what's the big deal. It's always been done.  Gotta watch out for those teetotaler guys----always preaching atcha!!
