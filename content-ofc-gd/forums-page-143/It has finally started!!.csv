952064,NAW,2016-01-06 16:45:00,4022,"  Doesn't look like they can make it to far out!  Likely only on 3""..  At it will likely be shot by the end of this weekend!  Hey Terry!  Is that you out there???"
952065,Joeytier,2016-01-06 16:51:00,3990,"Wow, they must be nuts...ice is barely walkable on small lakes up here lol"
952066,BillM,2016-01-06 16:54:00,17367,"If that's the lake I think it is, there was a report on another board that there's a good 4-6 inches of solid black ice.  Measured and tested."
952078,Acountdeleted,2016-01-06 18:48:00,2562,I heard that too. There is hope!
952088,esoxansteel,2016-01-06 20:36:00,1307,"looks like lake X, still rather fish steelhead though by far"
952089,Sinker,2016-01-06 20:48:00,8692,Nice. I bet its thicker after the weekend.  S.
952092,NAW,2016-01-06 21:13:00,4022,"Oh ya, I am heading out Friday morning for sure.  Can't wait!!  Different lake though.  I am really looking for a floater suite size small to buy or borrow.. If anyone has one kicking around.  It's a hard to find."

952104,SirCranksalot,2016-01-06 22:52:00,3291,"looks like lake X, still rather fish steelhead though by far  I'm not sure where you live but here in Wasaga we have enough ice to severely restrict fishing opportunities. Fast water sections are still open but I understand that they are not very desirable spots when the water is very cold. I'd really like to fish steelhead too, so if someone can  either tell me my understanding is wrong re fast water sections OR possibly PM me with a general area ghat's still fishable that would be just hunky dory!   thx"
