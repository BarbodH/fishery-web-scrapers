951421,Moosebunk,2016-01-01 16:11:00,3970,I caught this yesterday.  Exceptional dood!  Especially being your third year as you claim.  2016 will be even better.
951435,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-01 16:44:00,8243,"Bang on, you have the urban fishing down pat. I bet thousands of fishermen drive by your spots everyday and would never think about wetting a line there."
951449,Joeytier,2016-01-01 17:52:00,3990,Great video compilation!  Clearly you had a very successful season.
951529,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-02 14:32:00,937,"Thanks guys!  I was able to catch my first Gar, Channel Cat and Lake Trout in 2015.  I'm hoping to catch my first Whitefish, Walleye and Musky in 2016"
951534,Rizzo,2016-01-02 15:24:00,4754,"Nice video! Lots of beauty fish in there. As far as your other firsts for next year? If you want a musky go walleye fishing, if you want a walleye go musky fishing!"

951781,ehg,2016-01-04 13:35:00,2666,"Awesome array of fish from the metropolis of Toronto! Very familiar with exact locations. Largemouth Bass, smallmouth, northern pike, chinook, real beautiful brown trouts, bowfin, longnose gar, carp, big channel cat etc... was that  atlantic or coho in video, couldn't tell?  Believe it or not big walleye and small musky are caught sometimes in harbourfront. Use to be member (Snag) i would meet down there caught a small musky while doing the pike thing there.  Great summary thanks!"
