He would like it to be in Northeastern Ontario if possible, and in an area where Bass season would be open, and there also is good walleye fishing.  Anyone have any suggestions on where to go? I don't have a price range, I'll let him decide that based on the suggestions you can provide.  Thanks"

There's a bunch of back lakes I have fished within ON not far from my camp in QC that are killer in late May - early June.  Don't know about anywhere else in QC, but my section of N/W Quebec bass have a closed season.  You're right about NW Ontario though. Best smallmouth fishing in the province, no closed season and tons of fly in outfitters with bass as an option."

They have several outposts with Walleye and Smallmouth Bass and are most likely all located in FMZ8.   They also operate a fly-in fishing lodge.  Although not a fly-in, Happy Day Lodge might be worth a look.  It's fairly remote, has limited access and they have a boat-in outpost.   Located just west of Chapleau on Lake Windermere.  Books up fast."
