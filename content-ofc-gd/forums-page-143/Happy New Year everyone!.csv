There will be bumps in the road for some this year as there is every year but I'm confident that our community will pull together and try to smooth those bumps. That's the great part of this community that I'm a proud member of.  The important thing to remember is that we must try to stay healthy and happy....anything else you may want will fall into place.  Thanks everyone for letting me be a small part of it. Be well, all of you.   ps. Don't forget, fishing is still our raison d'Ãªtre."
