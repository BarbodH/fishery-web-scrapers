Started on Jan 2nd with ice fishing Simcoe lake trout and ended it on Dec 30th searching for Quinte walleye. The first half of the year was definitely nicer to me with great ice fishing and bass fishing. The salmon fishing was somewhat slow for myself but still made out okay. For the bottom half of the year, I didn't head out for steelhead much and walleye trolling was a fail. Here is a video I put together of my year. Enjoy  "

951890,BFSC Kevin,2016-01-05 01:49:00,1351,"Thanks gents.  Mike,  yeah I was really hoping to catch  the float dropping with a steelhead at the end of it.  Unfortunately,  I only went out a couple times and never got any on tape.   Brian,  I think there was some better shots but got lazy/tired and just used that one. LOL,  who's right beside with those greasers?  Lol.  Likewise,  it was nice to finally meet ya."
