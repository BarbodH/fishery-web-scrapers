951348,mr blizzard,2015-12-31 21:13:00,1589,"Bought a new rainbow atv/sled trailer from down south in Alta in the summer  It has a steel pull out ramp at the rear, its a flat bed trailer no tilt  Question  Royal has a super glide 11 pro kit for the ramp  BUT could I get away with ripping 2 long 1/4 inch strips of plywood PER ski with a half inch gap between them so the carbide would not touch the trailer deck and stick.. I would need 4 strips per sled  It would be cheaper  Thoughts and experience appreciated  Happy New Year  John"
951349,FloatnFly,2015-12-31 21:19:00,1640,run a couple of 2x4 s the length of the trailer?
951361,Freshtrax,2015-12-31 22:31:00,2215,We always used strips of drop in Bedliner F rom the scrapyard.
951371,mr blizzard,2015-12-31 23:05:00,1589,"thx FloatnFly,,measured but it will put the skis to high for the tie downs  Freshtrax u might be onto something,, it would give me the clearance I need and would stop the carbides from sticking in the wood"
951373,Freshtrax,2015-12-31 23:22:00,2215,it also keeps you in a straight line. they get cut up ever 2nd seanon or so but you only need to put down 2 5 inch strips per sled
951384,Dara,2016-01-01 04:08:00,3052,Old sliders.  Not sure what you have for clearance on the pull out ramp but on my fold up ramp I had expanded metal and the runners stuck to the steel. I put 2x4's on to lift the ski's but the ski's stuck to the wood so I put old sliders on the wood. It all guided me right up.  I actually got in trouble once in a western tire.  The salesman was selling a guy the UHMW slides for a plastic Otter sleigh for about $80.00  I got him aside and told him to just use old sliders that snowmobile shops toss out.  Man was that salesman mad at me when he walked out with nothing
951422,Moosebunk,2016-01-01 16:14:00,3970,"I just leave some pack ice and snow in the trailer for the sled to sit on or, leave a length of scrap plywood.  Do have some gouges from before though... and understand the annoyance."
951424,Joeytier,2016-01-01 16:19:00,3990,Old bedliner is the easiest and cheapest way to go!!  The carbides will also slide easier on bedliner than on wood
951442,Sinker,2016-01-01 17:00:00,8692,"Yep, I also use bedliner on my trailer. Slick as snot, and keeps you from sliding around."
951445,mr blizzard,2016-01-01 17:34:00,1589,Thx everyone for your ideas Kinda like the bed liner idea but up here they are as rare as a dodo bird but would be a great fix  Might have to go with plywood strips or just snow Thx again. Getting a little tired of walking out on the ice when there are to older decent sleds in the yard and a good trailer sitting in the driveway lol

Getting a little tired of walking out on the ice when there are to older decent sleds in the yard and a good trailer sitting in the driveway lol  There has to be half of one laying around in a junk yard somewhere? Last year I paid $20 for two, but I had to remove them from the trucks myself.  I have a 6 x 10 enclosed trailer with a high value anti slip rubber membrane to protect the deck so when I bought my sled last year I had to be sure the carbides wouldn't tear up the membrane. I simply cut some 60"" x 10"" strips and screwed them down and it works great. Decent for the ATV, but it wants to move around a bit more so I use a couple extra straps.  Strips of bedliner can be zip tied to ATV loading ramps so you can use the same ramps all year..."

951540,mr blizzard,2016-01-02 16:39:00,1589,Ch312  we just have a couple of very small wreckers up here but I will check again. Sounds like it would do the trick the way u described for your trailer  Fisherman  this also I will see if a wrecker has one in alta. maybe get one cheap and have sent up on a transport  Thx both of u
