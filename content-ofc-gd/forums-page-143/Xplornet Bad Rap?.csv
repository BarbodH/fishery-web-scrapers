So far, so good. I'm very pleasantly surprised at the reliability ,even during last nite's wind and snow. Now I live in beautiful country with good fishing and the 'net, to boot! Ah, sweet retirement."
951087,lew,2015-12-29 20:27:00,12766,"Ah, sweet retirement.  Congrats on the retirement, it's the best gig going."
951090,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-29 21:25:00,8243,"Xplornet was all we could get here until recently. Not fast enough for streaming i.e. Netflix etc. as I have learned from the techies here. Fast enough for us. Shaw has something faster out this way now, happy with xplornet, it's not prone to going down due to storms."
951133,Big Cliff,2015-12-30 11:09:00,6899,"Congrats on the retirement thing!  We had Xplornet here and were so happy to get rid of it, I even had the direct phone number or their operations manager at one point because there were so many problems with it (he finally left the company). At one point they were going to send a technician from Ottawa to here to fix things up but they wanted us to pay for the milage and travel time, five hours each way to fix their problems! We changed service providers.  Hopfully they have improved significantly!"

The only downer is download limits suck so it's pointless to get something like netflix. Also make sure the dish is clear of snow and signal can be lost during snow and rain storms."
951591,Paudash,2016-01-02 21:39:00,273,I have it and I use it it for Netflix.   Good for about 4 hours of movies but you have to turn the quality down to standard.  If you leave it at HD quality you you smoke through everything in a hour
951610,pike slayer,2016-01-02 23:39:00,1177,Pau dash which plan do you have? What's your daily limit?
951628,Paudash,2016-01-03 01:05:00,273,"We get 2Gb per day, and costs us $65 per month"
951657,pike slayer,2016-01-03 04:54:00,1177,Where are you located? I'm only getting 500mb per day and paying $73
