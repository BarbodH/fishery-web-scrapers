951562,Garcia96,2016-01-02 19:30:00,45,"Hey guys. i mostly fish the grand for smallmouth bass near cambridge. Ive been told from people who ""use to fish"" and say the grand has all kinds of pike and they told me certain spots and had no luck at all... Gto gas station in preston, the mill, and was even told preston high school and nothing. Can anyone give me a guide on where to locate them and could share a spot ( catch and release)?"
951571,johnl,2016-01-02 19:46:00,197,"Caledonia,York"
951572,Steve,2016-01-02 19:50:00,2075,"Not sure what section of the Grand you fish, but there are lots of pike downstream from York through to Cayuga."
951586,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-02 21:21:00,8243,Almost every fresh water fish species in that section of the river. Caledonia to Dunnville. Not much size or numbers but they are there. Even HTHM caught a Walleye there once. I'm not sure but you better check the regs to make sure it's open now above the Dunnville Dam. I'm fairly sure it is but that's not good enough.
951598,sauce,2016-01-02 22:59:00,219,Not the best time of year to target pike in your area. The best spots on the river will be frozen very soon.  The spots you mentioned are all good. One thing I have learned is that the pike are usually close to shore in these areas. Large minnows under a float are probably your best bet for numbers.
951603,leaf4,2016-01-02 23:11:00,2466,"Surprisingly enough I've see gar pike in there too, not large and for some reason unafraid of people, it was swimming between my legs lol, happened about two years ago fishing Caledonia dam on may 24"
951611,Garcia96,2016-01-02 23:41:00,45,I never fished in Caledonia but I will start for spring time. I never heard about the pike there but I did hear someone catching gars in there. The spots I mentioned have u guys fished there for pike this year ? For Caledonia should I try below the dam for pike?
951615,bigugli,2016-01-02 23:56:00,6138,"The whole Grand system is neat. I've caught pike in the Speed, Eramosa and Conestogo.  I've also caught pike in the Grand at Byng, Cayuga, downtown Cambridge"
951641,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-03 02:40:00,8243,"Get out there, pound the water, you might find them. I haven't heard about many Pike this time of year though. I know you are new here but no matter how long you have been here you won't get a GPS co ordinate. I know you haven't asked so take no offence. It's an inside joke."
951644,Freshtrax,2016-01-03 02:53:00,2215,ive caught the odd one from waterloo to cambridge.  usually fishing for bass on spinnerbaits
951650,bigugli,2016-01-03 03:11:00,6138,"Get out there, pound the water, you might find them. I haven't heard about many Pike this time of year though. I know you are new here but no matter how long you have been here you won't get a GPS co ordinate. Yep.   My game is to pick a stretch of river and walk and cast. Some days are good, others are a bust. There is just sooo much public accessible shoreline"
951663,tomkat,2016-01-03 05:08:00,246,From a canoe between glen Morris and Paris great day of fishing and paddling. Mostly bass with the odd pike small rapalas. That was summer time though.
951677,Garcia96,2016-01-03 13:16:00,45,That's something else I want to try and canoe glen Morris to Paris. But I'm for sure going to try Caledonia. When season kicks. Thanks guys !
951678,Fish Farmer,2016-01-03 13:53:00,2234,"Caught this little guy between Cayuga and Dunnville Jig & Minnow   Also a few of these, little tip, look for the wood. "
951722,Garcia96,2016-01-03 21:12:00,45,Nice pike! I never fished that part of the grand. When spring time comes I'm going to go wading there for the day and try my luck.
951884,duke01,2016-01-05 01:17:00,20,Fished the Grand below Caledonia all my life and have seen some good Pike caught. I wouldn't say a lot but enough to keep it interesting. I have caught good numbers right at Caledonia Dam in the spring. There is way more Gar around then Northern's.

952018,Garcia96,2016-01-06 00:27:00,45,Yes I know ! I had my slips this year LOL and what do gar go for other then flys? I could only think of a spinner.
952027,duke01,2016-01-06 01:11:00,20,I have caught them on twisters and just minnow under a float. You hook into a lot of Gar but it is mainly luck if they stay on.
952031,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-06 01:50:00,10439,I have caught them on twisters and just minnow under a float. You hook into a lot of Gar but it is mainly luck if they stay on.  Yep. I used minnows under a float with a tiny treble hook.
952048,wormdunker,2016-01-06 08:46:00,1711,There is also walleye in the river trolling shallow water above the Dunnville dam if you can't find your pike.  Free launch right in town upstream of the dam only a short distance.  We've caught them in the 2 - 3 lb size in early spring.
