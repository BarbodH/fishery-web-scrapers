952028,woodenboater,2016-01-06 01:20:00,2277,Staples should have security camera recordings of most if not aisles. let's hope they don't scrub them. They have insurance for a reason and u def should not be out of pocket due to their negligence. A different type of fall could have been worse. Don't be afraid to take them to task Cliff
952049,Big Cliff,2016-01-06 09:16:00,6899,"Less than a month for an MRI is terrific...I waited three months in Richmond Hill and another year or more for my back operation...  Hope it is not serious...   There used to be a phisio place on Lindsay Street just south of Kent on the west side...can't remember the name (it's me age...don't you know) but they were still covered by OHIP (grandfathered) 10 years ago... Apparently not any more Beans, it seems waiting times to get in were way too long.  I know Cliff is a straight up guy and not one to sue to try and make a buck but for me I chalk this kind of stuff up to accidents happen. .People slip in the winter, floors get wet. I don't really see anyone being liable. You take your chances and hope for the best when you venture out into the world.  I hope you have a speedy recovery. Could of been worse, bumped your noggin or something. The last thing I am looking for here is any sort of ""revenge"" (for lack of a better description) but I am already out of pocket a couple of hundred bucks with more to come. If there is some compensation available I will sure help!  Staples should have security camera recordings of most if not aisles. let's hope they don't scrub them. They have insurance for a reason and u def should not be out of pocket due to their negligence. A different type of fall could have been worse. Don't be afraid to take them to task Cliff I would think they would be very foolish to scrub them after someone my age went down so hard. I would think they would want a record of it just in case."
952055,bigugli,2016-01-06 12:33:00,6138,I sure hope you will get better soon my friend.
952130,Steve,2016-01-07 01:29:00,2075,"Staples isn't scubbing any security camera's, lol.  Staples would want the footage in the event Cliff was a fraud and decided to sue for millions of dollars claiming everything under the sun. "
951776,Big Cliff,2016-01-04 12:49:00,6899,"Well, the New Year is off to not so good a start. Last Thursday I was in Staples here in Lindsay and slipped on some water in one of the isles and went down rather hard.  The supervisior was wonderful, rushed over got me a chair (it had knocked the wind out of me) she offered to call an ambulance, get me some water.... after a couple of minutes and being allowed to catch my breath I just wanted to finish my shopping and get out of there.  Friday I stopped in just to thank her for her kindness and let her know that short of being a little sore I didn't think there was any serious damage, she seemed very relieved!  Saturday I was coming out of my garage and I was suddenly on the ground, I had no idea what had happened it was all so fast. At first I thought I must have slipped, I managed to get myself back up onto my feet, went to take a step and I was back on the ground again, it's like my leg wasn't there. Fortunatly I had a couple of friends here and they helped me get back to the house.  Sunday morning my knee was throbbing and I was afraid to even try to walk on it, when it had given out on Saturday there was no warning what so ever, it just buckled. (an old fat guy like me falling down isn't a pretty sight) I did manage to find an old cane we had here from years ago so I hobbled out to the car and drove my self to the hospital.  They checked me out, did xrays, The Dr. said it looks like the tendons in my knee are torn and they need to do an MRI to determine what the next step is. They fitted fitted me with a leg brace (then told me I can't drive with it on) and sent me home.  The worst part of the whole thing is prior to falling on the ground there was no pain or anything to indicate there was even a problem. Even now, the pain isn't really bad but I am almost scared to walk for fear that knee is just going to buckle again.  What a good way to start off 2016"
951777,Sterling,2016-01-04 12:51:00,477,"Cheers Cliff lots of people would have gone into ""I'm going to sue you!!!"" mode.  Have they told you what tendons are damaged?"
951778,Big Cliff,2016-01-04 12:52:00,6899,"No, I guess that's what the MRI will do but apparently I could be waiting for a long time to get that."
951788,Sinker,2016-01-04 14:24:00,8692,"Sorry to hear that Cliff. If you need a hand with anything, dont be afraid to ask!!!!  Take care of yourself!  S."
951790,Steve,2016-01-04 14:30:00,2075,"if you find you are out of any pocket expenses due to your fall at Staples, and want some assistance getting it back, let me know.  You are a good man and I don't expect you to try and sue frivolously, however, you are due any medical expenses, or if you need to take any extra transportation, or if you have any extra med costs as a result.  That is why these companies have insurance.  PM me if you want any assistance with this (I work in commercial insurance and can provide some advice how to get compensation without a major ""to do"")."
951792,wormdunker,2016-01-04 14:35:00,1711,I'm sad to hear of your health issue.  I hope you get well soon.  My biggest fear is how are you going to get in & out of your boat?  LOL!
951795,captpierre,2016-01-04 15:17:00,2521,"Sorry to hear about your troubles, Cliff. Take it easy. Sounds like may be ACL damage. Ligament not tendon. Let's hope not torn.  Would need to see a carpenter ( surgery) ?"
951799,FloatnFly,2016-01-04 15:39:00,1640,thats quite the rough start.  i think your fall at staples may have injured your knee without you realizing it
951800,Steve,2016-01-04 15:45:00,2075,another thought.Staples is not a grocery store (where it is somewhat common to have wet floors).  A store like Staples should never have water on the floor.....  Increased negligence on the part of Staples if trip and fall was a result of water on the floor.
951808,ketchenany,2016-01-04 16:01:00,3229,"Hope you feel better soon Cliff, I'd pay them a visit and explain what a happened next. Justa thought.  BTW Yes, MRIs take a while to be had."
951810,Beans,2016-01-04 16:11:00,3339,Welcome to my club old friend...My right leg kinda gave out on me a couple of years ago or so...I had to remember to lead with my left leg going up and down the back stairs...When my bro-in-law Gord heard about my third fall he rushed up here from Oshawa and built me a bannister to hold on to...Haven't fallen since...LOL    It will still be standing after the back porch falls down it is that sturdy...
951813,bigbuck,2016-01-04 16:32:00,2449,Ouch is right!!! Ice it and keep it elevated when you can to keep inflammation and swelling down. Hopefully it is not too badly damaged and you will be walking around soon enough.
951828,Big Cliff,2016-01-04 17:38:00,6899,"Sorry to hear that Cliff. If you need a hand with anything, dont be afraid to ask!!!!  Take care of yourself!  S.  Thank you for that very kind offer, I ended up getting a knee brace today and while it is uncomfortable at least I can get around now without the fear of stepping off into nothing. I even managed to get out and clear the bit of snow that was on the deck. I should be ok. if you find you are out of any pocket expenses due to your fall at Staples, and want some assistance getting it back, let me know.  You are a good man and I don't expect you to try and sue frivolously, however, you are due any medical expenses, or if you need to take any extra transportation, or if you have any extra med costs as a result.  That is why these companies have insurance.  PM me if you want any assistance with this (I work in commercial insurance and can provide some advice how to get compensation without a major ""to do"").  I wasn't thinking of suing them at all but I am out of pocket almost $200.00 already with the cost of parking at the hospital, the knee brace......, I went to see my Dr. this morning and she is refering me for Physiotherepy (I don't have coverage) and to see an orthpedic surgen. We'll see where all of this goes and I may ask them to cover my out of pocket expenses. I'm sad to hear of your health issue.  I hope you get well soon.  My biggest fear is how are you going to get in & out of your boat?  LOL! Easy at this point, fall in, fall out  another thought.  Staples is not a grocery store (where it is somewhat common to have wet floors).  A store like Staples should never have water on the floor.....  Increased negligence on the part of Staples if trip and fall was a result of water on the floor.  When it happened I was following one of their young sales people down the isle and suddenly I was on the floor. Once they got me a chair and I caught my breath I showed the supervisor the string of puddles on the floor and you could even see the one I had steped on as it was smeared. She went and got signs and put them up right away then went looking for a mop. Someone had obviously walked down the isle with slush on their boots. I don't know if you could call that negligence on Staples part? Hope you feel better soon Cliff, I'd pay them a visit and explain what a happened next. Justa thought.  BTW Yes, MRIs take a while to be had. Hospital just called, MRI Feb. 1 plus I am on the list if there is a cancelation. That's not so bad I guess."
951830,Steve,2016-01-04 17:42:00,2075,"keep track of all the out of pocket expenses you have, staples will pay them without even using insurance...  if the costs are less than 1K or 2K, they will just pay them.  They will have video of your fall. Their risk management team will have already reviewed the footage (standard risk management protocol).  you didn't sign anything at staples did you? (waiver, release, etc)"
951832,Big Cliff,2016-01-04 17:49:00,6899,"No, no one asked me to sign anything. Never thought about them having a vidio of it, I'd love to see that one because I know I did some awesom aerobatics on the way down LOL. All I could think of was not hitting my head. I was pretty shook up at the time and almost embarrased by the whole thing."
951833,Steve,2016-01-04 17:55:00,2075,"Well, you still have your head on straight (which is evident by the rational approach you have taken to this).  Take some rest and let me know if I can help in any way.  For every 10 people that trip and fall, only one or two aren't looking for fast payouts (which is the group you belong to).  Be well Sir."
951834,Joey,2016-01-04 17:56:00,9122,"Oh, that's terrible Cliff, hope you are feeling better soon hon !"
951837,Loonietoon,2016-01-04 18:36:00,1450,That is Terrible my friend and yes they will have video as all the stores have video cameras around... Take care of your self
951838,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-04 18:57:00,8243,"There's good news Cliff, you are bearing weight on that knee. If it indeed was a torn Patella tendon you would be in excruciating pain, even any other tear of soft tissue or ligament and your knee is the size of a football today and it would hurt, badly. I think you can go back into the game."
951847,Tom McCutcheon,2016-01-04 20:46:00,627,Good news on the MRI Cliff...I assume it is at Ross Memorial? I had both knees done on the same day last May at Ross (just scoped and cleaned out) but the pre operation procedure at Ross from the day of the MRI's to the operation was excellent. Nurses and Technicians are very knowledgeable and caring. I did not need to wait long for the MRI's as well. Just over a month if I recall correctly.  Hopefully you have only strained it and physio will make it better.
951848,ketchenany,2016-01-04 21:00:00,3229,Clif I would send them a letter regarding your condition now so they still remember. Just a thought
951849,manjo39,2016-01-04 21:05:00,354,Hope you get better soon.  Always willing to help out any way I can.
951863,DaveRoach,2016-01-04 22:31:00,202,Hope you feel better Cliff.....Horrible way to start the new year.
951867,crappieperchhunter,2016-01-04 23:16:00,2582,Sorry to hear the news Cliff.  I hope the MRI finds the problem and it's easy to fix. In the mean time take care and take it easy.  You know how to get ahold of Debbe and I if you need a hand with anything.
951977,Beans,2016-01-05 17:33:00,3339,Less than a month for an MRI is terrific...I waited three months in Richmond Hill and another year or more for my back operation...  Hope it is not serious...
