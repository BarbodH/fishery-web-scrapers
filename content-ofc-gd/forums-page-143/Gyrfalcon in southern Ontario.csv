952016,John Bacon,2016-01-06 00:24:00,3277,"Re: ""This particular gyrfalcon was only spotted once, on Dec. 27. But Preney said they're known to hunt ducks and other waterfowl, so the best bet on seeing it again would be to spend time near the Detroit River.""  I wonder if cormorants will be included in the 'other waterfowl'."
952025,cram,2016-01-06 00:59:00,1733,"That's VERY cool. If anyone wants to see a one (albeit in captivity), they have/had one at Mountsberg Conservation Area just west of Campbellville (along with several owls, eagles, hawks, etc)."

952063,Jon,2016-01-06 16:37:00,209,Very neat!!! There was one southeast of Ottawa last winter that hung around for a while.  https://www.mail-archive.com/[emailÂ protected]/msg35152.html  Jon
952067,BillM,2016-01-06 16:55:00,17367,I'm guessing there's gotta be one around this area.   Would be pretty awesome to see!
