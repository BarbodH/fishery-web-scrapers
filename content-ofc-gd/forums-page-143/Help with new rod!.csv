951500,Loonietoon,2016-01-02 01:05:00,1450,My father was just telling me about angling outfitters in Woodstock... Yes Joshlyn is an excellent guy to deal with he will not steer you wrong either.. figure it out Cambridge to far end of Woodstock or Cambridge to Hamilton Mountain ????
951505,buick14,2016-01-02 01:34:00,741,"Yep.  This holds true.  There ways around it sometimes, not always.  If you are fishing xraps spinners etc in grand, but also want something beauty for everything...a proper medium/fast anywhere from 6'4-7'2 will work, and they pop up often. Heck, buy a used or new cheaper ml rod and a medium, and see which u use most, then sell the other/uupgrade accordingly.  I will point out that a ballistic will drop in $$  on resale incase u dont like it....hard."
951535,Mike Pike,2016-01-02 15:25:00,1332,"As mention before, Natural Sports in Kitchener is very close to you and has quite an awesome selection.  You can even call Neslon before you make the drive out to see if he has your model in stock.  Also, have you shopped the new Sail store in Cambridge?  A good place to try, as well.  Ps.. Ooops sorry, I see you already checked with Natural Sports for the rod.  Anyhoo, I was in there a few weeks ago and was very impressed with their reel selection.  Lots of choice and they had a lot on sale as well.  PPS.. I wade the Grand a lot too.  Try adding a twister tail grub and jig combo to your attack.  And 1/8th once jig will stay above all that matted weed on your retrieve and has accounted for a lot of bass for me."
951537,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-02 15:53:00,8243,If you read every reel website they are all super smooth. All the more reason to put one in your hand and feel it. I have held some very expensive reels that just don't fit my paw.
951545,Crackerjack,2016-01-02 17:50:00,34,"Cant speak for the reel but I have the 7ft medium paired with the stradic c14, wow! best set up that I ever owned"
951553,GBW,2016-01-02 18:42:00,8460,
951724,Garcia96,2016-01-03 21:29:00,45,Mike the pike I'm going to Try calling natural sports tomorrow. And I buy all my tackle at sail in Cambridge. They just didn't have the rod and reel I looking for. If I don't go with the shimano I will probably go to sail to find another rod. Was also interested in the fenwrick  elite bass rod. And I love wading with grubs. Smallest inhale them! And GBW  & old iron maker of course I will feel the rod with reel. Both stores In Hamilton have the reels in stock and few zodias left.
951728,spincast,2016-01-03 21:44:00,3279,"Was also interested in the fenwrick elite bass rod. Last I was down at Grimsby Tackle I believe he had a couple bass elites on sale. If you'r heading to Hamilton anyway, always worth checking out G-T http://www.grimsbytackle.com/Specials.html"
951751,Garcia96,2016-01-04 01:09:00,45,"Downriggin junkie, those fenwrick bass elite rods good for pike too . I mainly target smallmouth and trying for pike. You think it's a good all specie rod? Maybe medium or medium light with 2500 reel"
951752,chris.brock,2016-01-04 01:38:00,4053,"I would spend the money on the reel, not the rod, and the reel would be a Shimano.  I've got a $400 rod but my favorite is a $40 rod I've had for years.  I wouldn't buy a rod or combo online without being able to hold it in my hand."
951756,landry,2016-01-04 01:58:00,1005,LotsA great advice here. For the $$$ I have found Basspro Carbonlites to be great rods. You can get a great Grand River Rod setup for 200$. No need to spend more or import. As said marketing hype/Bull is rampant.
951761,tomkat,2016-01-04 02:45:00,246,I have the fenwick elite tech smallmouth rod and I really like it. Very nice rod for the price range.
951774,spincast,2016-01-04 10:31:00,3279,"Downriggin junkie, those fenwrick bass elite rods good for pike too . I mainly target smallmouth and trying for pike. You think it's a good all specie rod? Maybe medium or medium light with 2500 reel Wrong guy to ask, while I fish for pike and bass, I don't have speciality rods for them, nor have I looked into them as I don't fish for them often enough to justify the outlay. Although I did pick up a crucial through a friend I met on OFC.  I saw you mentioned you might be interested in an elite in your previous post. I picked up a couple of the walleye elites just before Xmas and at that time he had a couple bass elites for sale. At  % off, it's hard to go wrong. And you are supporting a local vendor, not some foreign owned mega corporation that takes the profits out of Canada.  I believe it is important we support our local guys, who are after all our neighbours, for many reasons."
951878,Garcia96,2016-01-05 00:50:00,45,"Sorry spincast for the mix confusion :s lol if I go with the elite bass tech I think I'll go with the 6'9"" medium moderate-fast rod. Smallies for sure and pike if I can find them. And thanks for the advice guys ! Great help and outgoing. Makes me like OFC even more! Tomcat you caught pike on the elite tech?"
951338,Garcia96,2015-12-31 19:53:00,45,"Hello I'm new to ontariofishingcommunity.com and I love it! But was wondering if someone on here could give some advice. I'm about to make my first order online at Americanlegacy.com and wanting to purchase the Diawa ballistic ex 2500 and the Shimano zodias 6'8"" or 7' medium light action rod. Do you guys think it's a good match and good balance?"
951339,Garcia96,2015-12-31 19:59:00,45,"Also my current rod is an Abu Garcia 6'6"" medium action rod and it says max lure weight is 3/8 oz.. The new rod I want to buy is medium light action only and its 7 feet but says max lure weight is 3/8 oz? Does that mean it will have same fighting strength? I'm asking because they don't carry just the medium action rod. Reply back would be much appreciated"
951350,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-31 21:26:00,8243,"As far as the rods they are both good choices and I wouldn't over think it much. I have a 5'6 Abu ultra lite as well as a 6'6"" and I love them both. I don't buy anything I can't see and touch. Can you not look at one locally then buy it online if it's a deal. Both the local tackle shops I deal with will match most online prices and order the item in. Fishing World and Bill's Bait in Hamilton.  I would like to welcome you aboard. Good fishing."
951353,Garcia96,2015-12-31 21:32:00,45,Thanks for the reply! The reason why I was ordering is because sail here in Cambridge and BPS don't carry it  and I didn't understand why my Abu medium action is the same lure weight requirements for the shimano zodias medium-light.
951355,Garcia96,2015-12-31 21:44:00,45,I just checked out the fishing world site. The rod I want is $269 but online it's like $190. You think they would match that price? The reel I want it out of stock there tho
951356,irishfield,2015-12-31 22:02:00,26272,You've heard of the 72 cent dollar correct?
951357,Roy,2015-12-31 22:15:00,13728,I assume that the $169 price is in USD  which works out to $263 in Canadian dollars plus shipping of course. If I were you I'd shop in my area which in your case is a decent area for tackle shops. Go talk to them and see what they say. Then you can always come back to our classifieds and see what some of the members here in your area might have for sale. Just a thought.   edit: Wayne's too fast.
951367,GBW,2015-12-31 22:54:00,8460,"Go to a few smaller places that have the brands you're after and put the rod and reel together to see if you like the feel of it. You might find a rod or reel off your list to match up better. If I ever buy online I know what I'm getting from seeing it and holding it prior. The CAD vs USD will kill your ""deal"" as stated..."
951368,GBW,2015-12-31 22:57:00,8460,Where are you located? If JB's is close then check them out for sure! From SERVICE to price it's worth a trip to the smaller stores...
951369,aplumma,2015-12-31 22:57:00,6896,If you have the time you will find some great rod and reel combos come thru here. It may not be the specific one you are asking for but other combos may do fit the bill.   Welcome to OFC.  Art
951370,misfish,2015-12-31 22:59:00,29133,"Ya, I buy online, once I know it works for me. Deals now are not there IMO with the CDN $. Gas is in my favor though. 88 a lt this morning.  Fisherpete gives stuff away in the clfieds. LOL  Welcome to the site BTW."
951380,tomkat,2016-01-01 02:05:00,246,Some of the best deals come from small local shops. Check a few out I like to waggle a rod before I buy it. Plus it's nice to support local business.
951385,Dara,2016-01-01 04:20:00,3052,"Deals or not, a 2500 series reel seems pretty heavy to match up with a 7' med lt rod but i'm basing that on walleye type rods.  Best to go to a store and put the reel on the rod and see what you think"
951391,Garcia96,2016-01-01 06:17:00,45,Thanks for the replies guys! I live in Cambridge and I don't know small local shops around here. A lot closed down from what I heard. I can try calling around. The reason why I was going for medium light was because the lure weight max was 3/8 oz and my medium action Abu I have now is the exact same lure weight requirement but it's medium action. I'd have to feel it myself. But if have to go for the medium then I will pair it with the 2500.
951402,salmon,2016-01-01 14:31:00,334,This is in your area naturalsports.ca
951404,lookinforwalleye,2016-01-01 14:57:00,4399,Like the boys said a worth less dollar pretty much kills anything from the States plus shipping a 7 foot rod tube is not cheap....
951417,Loonietoon,2016-01-01 16:03:00,1450,"I live in Cambridge... Check with Greg & Tim at Bills Bait and Tackle in Hamilton, I deal with them a lot and they will go out of their way to help set you up with the proper setup"
951437,Garcia96,2016-01-01 16:46:00,45,The shipping for amercianlegacy is free. And thank you I emailed them to see what they had in stock . Saves the drive lol. Thanks guys and happy new year
951440,buick14,2016-01-01 16:58:00,741,"You will get your first taste of import/brokerage fees  Buy a better used rod locally, for less.  Or buy from natural, fishing world or get one of the many rods sail pretty much gives.away between now and spring"
951447,GBW,2016-01-01 17:47:00,8460,buick14 is telling you some good info there too. He's one to trust there as he's got a TOP NOTCH arsenal of fishing gear... You DO want to check what's being sold on this site first as Brian mentioned. I have gotten a few things off Pete at great rates! Others too... Just some 'food for thought' there.
951448,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-01 17:50:00,8243,"Garcia, you aren't far from Bill's Bait. Take the 403 to Hamilton and take the airport exit. Turn left, North, on Upper James and Bill's is a few mins down the road."
951489,Garcia96,2016-01-01 23:30:00,45,"I usually just go wading  with in-lines , x raps. Soft plastics. Mostly fish smallmouth in the grand. Trying to find pike spots. I emailed few local stores. My father was just telling me about angling outfitters in Woodstock. Prob going to check it out. Idk why but my heart is on the 2 new Diawa reels. Apparently super smooth , light , waterproof drag system. Fishing world I will be checking too. And most good rods and reels that caught my eye at sail are sold out but could possibly check it out still for at least a rod."
951495,tomkat,2016-01-02 00:46:00,246,Burns fishing in Burlington Fishing World Hamilton Bills Bait And Tackle. I have had good deals at all of them.
951496,wormdunker,2016-01-02 00:59:00,1711,Yup be careful when purchasing on line from the USA.  I just learned the hard way.  New inflatable PFD regular $200 on sale 1/2 price - $99.00.  with shipping 26 bux + exchange on the dollar they billed my visa $176.00!  That's not all.  I just received a bill from UPS.  The bill states I owe them another $41.00 for import duties & brokerage fees & of course HST!  So the total for a 99 dollar PFD is now $217.00!  Do your best to shop at your local tackle shop.
951498,mikeh,2016-01-02 01:03:00,824,There are a few stores that have no tax sales coming up
