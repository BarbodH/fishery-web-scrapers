951819,NAW,2016-01-04 17:02:00,4022,"  After reading the two other rather depressing ""ice fishing"" reports put up by Chad and Chris, I thought I would have a go.  But I didn't have any luck either!!  Found ""safe"" ice, but could only make it to 8 fow. So I fished for an hour.  Marked one school of bait fish.  No big marks..  Went home cold, but anxious for later this week!  2 nights of cold coming, should put me on top of some crappies!!"
951820,Acountdeleted,2016-01-04 17:06:00,2562,You found safe ice?!?  Now this has me excited!  I'm thinking next Sunday I'm getting out..... I hope.
951821,NAW,2016-01-04 17:08:00,4022,I should have figured you would be the first to reply to this post!!!  This is the same spot we where singing frosty the snowman last year...
951823,Acountdeleted,2016-01-04 17:21:00,2562,Thought I recognized it. I'm chomping at the bit like crazy bud. Weather has been to cold to kayak fish and too warm to ice fish.  Soon though.
951824,AKRISONER,2016-01-04 17:26:00,5558,the boys will be out in PAB on saturday...not venturing far but out on the drop off infront of my place...ill let everyone know how much ice they have.
951826,Rod Caster,2016-01-04 17:30:00,5784,"hey jer, how many years ago was it that we were fishing around Dec 1st for splake?? What a different year!"
951829,Acountdeleted,2016-01-04 17:41:00,2562,I was just thinking that Chad. Was it really December 1st?  We need another winter like that. The missus keeps asking me when I'm going to bring her some fresh fish home.
951840,EC1,2016-01-04 20:00:00,930,:Gonefishing: Can't wait!! Have fun this weekend!
951846,Joeytier,2016-01-04 20:43:00,3990,"Oof, that looks dicey.  Going out tomorrow with a little more confidence this time."
951852,chris.brock,2016-01-04 21:17:00,4053,"That's gotta feel good, getting out on the ice, bright sunshine, Nick.  We might be fishing Sunday in Haliburton Jeremy, I'll let you know."
951853,NAW,2016-01-04 21:17:00,4022,"It was dicey for sure!!  I only made it about 70' from shore...  1"" black 1"" foggy junk..  It's looking like Friday morning is the day to head back up based on my work schedule.  Should be another inch of good black ice if not more.  I may be acting a little over optimistically!  2 years ago I was on this lake the last weekend of November.  The year before it was the first week of December."
951854,NAW,2016-01-04 21:19:00,4022,"Oh Ya!!  I was laying on the ice, soaking up the sun!  In a -25 windchill..."
