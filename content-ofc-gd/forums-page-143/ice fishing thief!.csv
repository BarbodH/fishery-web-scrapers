951873,G.mech,2016-01-04 23:42:00,830,Too funny!  I've never messed with a mink before but I think I'd be letting him have a walleye rather than eat my fingers....
951874,misfish,2016-01-04 23:50:00,29133,LOL  Thanks for sharing Andrew.
951875,NAW,2016-01-04 23:55:00,4022,That's hilarious!!  I don't know what I would Do.  Likely arm myself with something..  My slush scoop has a built in ice chipper..

951900,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-05 02:44:00,956,Pretty persistent little guy.  Foods a little scarce that time of year so why not just let him have it?
951919,OhioFisherman,2016-01-05 04:12:00,6623,"LOL, that was cool!"
951932,wormdunker,2016-01-05 09:49:00,1711,"That was hilarious.  I'm wondering how the mink found those guys way out on the ice, probably a remote location."
