951622,DT10Sam,2016-01-03 00:40:00,480,"I just learned that a member of OFC dropped some food off at our house on New Years Day. My kids thanked them and they left in a hurry not wanting to be given credit I assume. I have been battling cancer and just before Christmas we were informed that Kingston General Hospital cancer clinic can no longer assist me and they could not say how much time I have left. I will be going to Princess Margaret Hospital on Monday in hopes that they have some meds that will keep me around longer.  Again I don't know who you are but my family and I thank you, it was someone in a blue Chevy pickup fairly new model.  Regards, Sam"
951625,Loonietoon,2016-01-03 00:47:00,1450,Sorry to hear of this dreaded disease has struck you... hope you can get the help you need there as they did a lot with Waynes daughter l believe it was there. The gift to received from someone from the OFC Family does not surprise me at all. Prayers for you my friend

In the 5 years we spent running the halls there they made leaps and bounds in advancement. Hopefully they have the right ticket for you!"
951634,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-03 02:09:00,8243,"Not something you want to read about. Hang in brother OFC er, it's amazing what the medics can do today. There are many survivors of this crap disease,myself included. I only have to get an annual checkup, 4 years since surgery. You can join the club too. My sis-in-law got to ring the golden bell just last week. She was given 6 months to a year 2 years ago and she rang the all clear to live your life bell. So can you.  Whomever donated the food, you are the bomb."
951647,bigugli,2016-01-03 03:04:00,6138,Do not give up the ship. The Mrs is still doing fine since treatment completed over 2 years back. The brother-in-law is still hanging in despite a number of inoperable tumors. He has now gone 2 Christmases longer than expected. thanks to PMH.
