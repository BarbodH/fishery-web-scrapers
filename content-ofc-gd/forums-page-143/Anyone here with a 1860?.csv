I've been looking around and by looking at USD prices I can get into a grizzly 1860 for about $3500 USD. To try and keep costs down, I will go with a bare hull, add a center console myself, used trailer and motor.  Anyone here fish a 1860 jon (tracker, lund, g3 ect) in the kawarthas? I like the idea of the mod v design and the massive 7ft beam. My 14ft was a PITA on a windy day to say the least.. but it also had a tiny beam. How would a 1860 in some rough chop? Any suggestions or feedback is appreciated.   Thanks."

951740,chris.brock,2016-01-03 22:46:00,4053,The beam and the floor space is great. The trade off is it's going to ride terrible in some chop. I would avoid Tracker boats too. JMO.
