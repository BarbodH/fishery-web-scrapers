950622,JoePa,2015-12-25 17:11:00,179,Just passing on some experience that I've had over the years - first take off the battery terminals and give them a good cleaning by brushing them with a tool make to clean them - often times the battery connections look good but there is a film between the cables and the battery posts -  When you hear the clicking the solenoid trying to close but it doesn't have enough juice to stay closed or it is bad - your battery may be weak - putting a volt meter on it won't tell you if it is in good shape - you can test the battery fluid if you can get at it - what I usually do to see if my battery is in good shape is put on the headlights and try starting the car - watch the lights - if the brightness really goes down the battery is weak - try jumping the battery with another battery in some other car while it is running -  Starters go bad but not that often - make sure that all wires leading to the starter are connected and sound - I bet your battery or its connections are the problem

Its likely its developed a flat spot and will need to be changed. Tapping on it will get you to and from for a little while but eventually it will just give up.  1.) I haven't taken a starter apart in 45 years or so, things have probably changed?  The starters had motor brushes in them and they would wear, on small block chevy engines they were located on the rear end of the starter as I recall. It was pretty easy to take a length of pipe, wood, steel bar and put it on the back end of the starter and tap it while someone else was turning the key.  Back in the day you could buy a new set of stater motor brushes and springs at the auto parts store, they were easy to replace.   "

952168,DanD,2016-01-07 13:03:00,2223,"You can use the meter to see what the voltage drop is when you try to start the battery.  Art  Another type of voltage drop test that will test the cables and connections.    The diagram shows the meter connection points, to test the battery positive cable between the battery and the battery terminal of the starter solenoid. With meter connected and the circuit idle (Everything off) the meter should show zero voltage or very near zero. If there is voltage present; then there is an open in the circuit. (Something not making a connection) With the meter still connected the same way; attempt to crank the engine and take a meter reading. You will seem voltage; but it should not exceed 1/4 (.25) of a volt, with the ignition in the crank position. Any more then .25V and there is high resistance in the circuit; ether a bad cable of a corroded connection. The same test applies to the negative side of a circuit; battery negative to starter case or engine main ground. Usually resistance tests are performed with an ohmmeter; but in the case of large cables an ohmmeter can give you a false reading. For example a #6 gauge cable (typical starter cable size) is 3/4 rotted trough. An ohmmeter will still show every low resistance on an idle circuit; because the few strands that are not rotted are still making a connection. You cannot test a live circuit with an ohmmeter; not without letting the smoke out of the electronics or blowing the meter's fuse.  The cable that tested good with the ohmmeter, is now asked to carry the approx 300 amps required to crank the engine; but this amperage cannot get passed the rotted section of cable; ending in a no crank or a strong click from the started solenoid. A voltage drop test is a dynamic resistance test on a live circuit and will take all doubt out of cable and connection condition. Sorry for the long post; didn't know a short way of explaining?

950532,lew,2015-12-24 20:46:00,12766,Any chance you trucks battery cables are corroded and not letting enough juice flow from the battery to engage the starter ?

950534,aplumma,2015-12-24 20:52:00,6896,Check the ground strap from the negative side of the battery to the engine/starter motor. One test is to take a volt meter and go from the pos. and neg. posts. Turn key and see if the voltage drops when you are trying to start the engine. This will tell you if it is a loose wire (no volt drop) or a bad starter (fast volt drop) this test should be done no more than 5 seconds though. You also can take the jumper cable and go from the negative of the battery to the shell of the starter motor. If it works then the ground strap is bad. Check and clean all connections even if they look good between the battery and starter motor. The clicking leads me to believe that your circuits are good you just can't get the voltage to work. IE bad connection or brushes cooked in starter motor.   Art
