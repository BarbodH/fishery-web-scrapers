937045,FloatnFly,2015-09-29 00:24:00,1640,"Definitely not splake...Also, the regs regarding auroras (aka stocked color variations of brook trout!) are outrageously stupid.  not unlike the Atlantic Salmon regs in Quebec in Gaspe Bay, 2 and done, C&R only, say you pay for OoP license, then pay the money for the lottery system to fish certain pools, thinks its like $100/day per pool,  arrive at 630, land 2 fish by 7, and you are done for the day"

937069,S.M.05,2015-09-29 01:26:00,145,"Looks like an Aurora to me. Congrats on catching a couple of those cool little trout.  A few years back MNR accidentally stocked aurora fingerlings in a speck lake. Can only assume you guys where fishing it, in which case there's no problems since the stocking lists clearly states that brook trout stocked lake regulations apply to it.  BTW lots of fun rules regarding the Aurora trout and their lakes. Reminds me of playing card games with my cousin, he made them up as we played. If its not in the regs its probably its probably not a rule. (check with MNR when in doubt)"

There are 9 that they rotate, plus I believe three that are continual sanctuaries. And obviously the lake I caught these in, which is none of those.  I'm pretty familiar with the aurora lore... I've been trying for 4 years now. They weren't supposed to be in this lake."
951119,cl_fishin,2015-12-30 01:53:00,138,Curious as to how this turned out.............any word from the MNR. Also congrats on the Aurora I know you have been trying to awhile.
951512,pike slayer,2016-01-02 04:45:00,1177,That is definitely a splake. I fished multiple splake lakes and they all looked exactly like that.
951528,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-02 14:30:00,937,How big can those trout get?
951772,Chuck Enwinde,2016-01-04 08:34:00,247,"Biggest I've seen was about three pounds but the record is over six.  Most of the ones I've caught actually had one faint red dot with a blue halo if you looked close but yeah, those are Rory's."

936714,MJL,2015-09-27 04:22:00,2427,Aurora trout?
936715,adempsey,2015-09-27 04:32:00,1498,"edit:  Bah, I didn't know you were playing us.  Congrats on the catches!"

936755,Moosebunk,2015-09-27 15:05:00,3970,Check one off the bucketlist.  You're on a roll.  What's next?
936762,adolson,2015-09-27 15:37:00,783,"Guys, be serious. These are not auroras. Impossible, since they don't exist, and we weren't even fishing one of the aurora lakes.  The two of us caught between 10 and 15 of them in an afternoon, which makes them the easiest trout we've ever caught, ever. Again, another strike against them being auroras.  The only thing in favor of them being auroras is that they lack the spots, and they fought like crazy - they felt like a fish 5 times their size, which only increased the disappointment as they neared the canoe.  We were getting annoyed because we were trying to catch some nice brook trout, which is all that was supposed to be in the lake, but these little things kept hitting our lures, no matter where we went, what we put on, if we trolled or cast... We only managed two ""regular"" brook trout.  So what are they, some new kind of invasive trout species?"
936763,misfish,2015-09-27 15:55:00,29133, Now thats funny right there.    You got your answer.  Congrats
936769,dave524,2015-09-27 16:26:00,4508,"Any spec I've caught this late in the season has been really coloured up, especially the males, spawning time and colours.  Slight notch to the tail ? maybe Splake of some sort."
936774,mike rousseau,2015-09-27 16:42:00,4661,"Nice haul if ""whatever"" trout  Looks like a fun day"
936783,Freshtrax,2015-09-27 17:16:00,2215,Sure looks like some of the pics I've seen of auroras.
936889,Rod Caster,2015-09-28 13:15:00,5784,Send photos to MNR asap
936892,Joeytier,2015-09-28 13:23:00,3990,Great job!  Stocking lists and what the ministry actually puts into those little lakes are two very different things sometimes.  It wouldn't surprise me if they were already well aware
936907,highdrifter,2015-09-28 15:04:00,2534,"Dude nice auroras!!  Believe me when I say Auroras..  I've worked at Hill's Lake FCS rearing, feeding, spawning and stocking them, so I can ID them well.  I probably don't have to remind you of the rules re: catching auroras.  That lake you fished is also listed on Fish ON-Line.  Here's the link just in case...  http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html  Gonna hit up a lake northwest of Timmins for them next weekend!!  cheers HD"
936909,BillM,2015-09-28 15:06:00,17367,Isn't the limit 1 each and you've gotta keep them? ie no catch and release?   I know they had some weird regs.
936910,adolson,2015-09-28 15:12:00,783,"Yep. First thing I did was sent the pics to the MNR. I might stop in at the Hill's Lake hatchery sometime if I don't hear back soonish. Someone there might know what's up.   Isn't the limit 1 each and you've gotta keep them? ie no catch and release?   I know they had some weird regs.  Yes, that's the regs... But we were fishing a non-aurora lake. So what do you do if you hit your regular trout lake, and you pull in something that's not supposed to be there? We pulled out two brook trout from the lake, which is what was supposed to be in there, and what we were targeting.   Dude nice auroras!!  Believe me when I say Auroras..  I've worked at Hill's Lake FCS rearing, feeding, spawning and stocking them, so I can ID them well.  I probably don't have to remind you of the rules re: catching auroras.

Yip..  and you're supposed to stop fishing after you've caught one.  So feigning ignorance ain't gonna help ya when you contact the ministry to report a new species of trout...  But hey, I'm sure they'd get a chuckle if you swore that you thought they were Atlantics!!"
936913,BillM,2015-09-28 15:20:00,17367,MNR Pilots got their lakes mixed up? lol
936917,darsky,2015-09-28 15:45:00,586,look like small splakes
936923,Acountdeleted,2015-09-28 16:11:00,2562,"I was thinking splake too.   Wow...... So ok, you pick up your canoe and portage to a lake a km away to go fishing because a buddy told you about a good brook trout lake.  First cast you hook into a for sure for sure Aurora trout. You have to pick up your gear and leave the lake? Sooooo strange."

You have to pick up your gear and leave the lake? Sooooo strange.   Yeah, I mean, I'm still not even 100% convinced it's auroras, and I didn't believe it in the moment, either. We had tried for them at Pallet Lake in the morning with not even a bite, so we left and went to a year-round brook trout lake for the afternoon (and no, it wasn't Lake 57 by mistake - I had my GPS and we weren't even near it). First cast hooked into a brookie; thought it was a sign of good things to come...  I'd like to think some people here know me well enough that I wouldn't willingly be breaking regulations. Obviously, if it had been Pallet or Big Club Lake, we wouldn't have continued fishing, being fully aware of the regs. I'd also have been convinced I'd caught an aurora and you can bet your ass would have celebrated and had a shore lunch... Instead, I was just confused and somewhat annoyed. We did only keep one each, just in case, but continued to fish the lake for brook trout, which produced only two total for the few hours we were there.  In my opinion, it's pretty stupid if they list a lake as being open year-round for brook trout, and then dump auroras in there... Considering they say they're the same species, and auroras are just a color morph, maybe they've decided to stop the aurora program and just dump all the stock into brookie lakes? That would make sense I guess, but I still want confirmation and clarification from an official."
936935,BillM,2015-09-28 16:57:00,17367,"Something is definitely messed up..  If the lake isn't listed as an Aurora lake, then it's fair game.  Even if those were Auroras, the MNR screwed up not you."
936941,Rod Caster,2015-09-28 17:17:00,5784,"Absolutely what Bill said. You did your due diligence. Very little chance they'll bother you.  on second thought, how much does the MNR Tips pay for good intel???  :D"
