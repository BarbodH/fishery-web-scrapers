951621,Meegs,2016-01-03 00:39:00,249,"Made it out this afternoon for afew hours. Left the house at 2 and was on water by 2 15. Went out to the first spot and looked around for some fish on the graph. Started marking some good fish so dropped the anchor. Fished a half hour fighting the wind and waves. With no fish or hits we moved to a calmer area I knew of.  Drove all around in search mode for abit. Didn't mark much in the r0 to 70 for range but found a good concentration at the 90 foot mark.  Dropped anchor again and started to jig.  Working my jig for 10 min or so and wham... fish on!!! Loose it half way up. 5 min later I hook another.  A nice eater lake trout! Then managed to get afew whitefish topside while shaking off afew at the side of the boat, lost 3 or 4 half way up and missed some hits. Was back at the launch at 4 30 and home before 5.  Was a great start to 2016!"

951630,Acountdeleted,2016-01-03 01:17:00,2562,Very nice Meegz. Those look delish.
951632,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-03 01:18:00,956,"Not bad for a quick outing.  Got my motor winterized now, but was planning on hitting simcoe before the ice formed.  Just a little nervous for my 14 footer and those waves.  Next year"
951633,Rob,2016-01-03 01:27:00,467,Nice work James! Good to see pics of whities again!  Rob C
951636,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-03 02:21:00,8243,That's the spirit Meegs. What do you do to make sure you don't freeze anything when you pull the boat out?
951639,Gallie,2016-01-03 02:36:00,1215,"Nice dude, sweet whities!"

951662,wormdunker,2016-01-03 05:07:00,1711,"Good fishin!  History might be in the making.  Open water fishing Jan. 1, 2016 on Simcoe"
951664,Joeytier,2016-01-03 05:15:00,3990,"^^ that's actually quite common, more common than the main lake actually having good ice on opening day."
951673,Meegs,2016-01-03 12:15:00,249,Yea. Quite common.  I've been in the canoe out there on February 10th before!fished opener from the boat many time!
951688,mr blizzard,2016-01-03 15:38:00,1589,"Congrats on the outing. Great results for sure  Open water in January is a little frustrating for the hard water fisherman. But not uncommon as mentioned  17 years ago I was fishing open water at the end of the finger docks in Barrie at the end of January  The next day a buddy of mine called and said go buy the Toronto star. I said why he replied there is a picture of u in it. The caption read ""one lonely fisherman waiting for winter"".  Fortunately the photographer got my best side. My backside lol  Still have it. Wish I could post it  Glad u had a great day"

951758,Beans,2016-01-04 02:19:00,3339,Our nieces husband was damned he wasn't going to miss opening of trout season because of no ice...I hear he caught a few and kept one for dinner  
951759,crappieperchhunter,2016-01-04 02:27:00,2582,Nice fish and great report James.  Love your photo too Beansie. Is that a electric trolling motor on the back? Must not have far to go if it is.
951760,irishfield,2016-01-04 02:39:00,26272,"Nice James, I'm sure you enjoyed the afternoon out! Be well !"
951812,Beans,2016-01-04 16:30:00,3339,Nice fish and great report James.  Love your photo too Beansie. Is that a electric trolling motor on the back? Must not have far to go if it is. Yep...you have  good perception...He could have rowed out to where he got the trout it was that close to his cottage...lucky him eh ?
