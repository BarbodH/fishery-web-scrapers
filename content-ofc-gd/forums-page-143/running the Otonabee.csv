952264,misfish,2016-01-08 00:28:00,29133,"Raw soft water music,  And yes, please be kind to the carp. My buddy likes them."

952285,Joeytier,2016-01-08 02:59:00,3990,Looks like a fun ride...Ill pass on the fuel bill though
952289,dave524,2016-01-08 03:19:00,4508,Isn't the speed limit 10 Kph within 100 feet of shore ?
952290,chris.brock,2016-01-08 03:21:00,4053,Gotta love a screaming 2 stroke at WOT though.

952318,oldphart,2016-01-08 15:26:00,665,"~~~~Thanks for posting love the ride, going to watch it again"
952320,hirk,2016-01-08 15:50:00,571,"Im glad I wasnt on the river that day. Sheesh....  S You would be bothered a lot more by a 36' cabin barely on plane throwing a 3' wake, these boats barely throw one sinker."
952322,hirk,2016-01-08 15:56:00,571,"Ha any of these you....I always get a kick outa these guys when I'm fishing. The only question I have is how fast can you stop? there are some corners i'd rather not meet you on lol  I did the video, these guys are very familiar with the river, they know when to slow down and how to run it."
