951405,skinny,2016-01-01 15:19:00,442,my Daughter was looking to order a hoodie for her boyfriend (bday gift) but by the time all the shipping is done it's 78.00 and not sure if that's cnd or US funds some time ago I remember someone was saying of a way to order and ship right from Vaughn store. We thought of making the trip but can't seem to get the family schedual to work out (everyone wants to go)  or is anyone going that way  and is close to Delhi that might play mule  thanks a ton Tim
951411,Loonietoon,2016-01-01 15:52:00,1450,You can make the trip to St Kits right off the Highway before Niagara Falls
951413,FloatnFly,2016-01-01 15:58:00,1640,"yes, BP is in american funds, and its nearly impossible to get things shipped to a Canadian store.  either the BP in Niagara, or Vaughan is your best bet"
951423,skinny,2016-01-01 16:14:00,442,making the trip is not such a issue as causing a war in the family because someone cant go due to having to work it's what I live with

951617,smitty55,2016-01-03 00:19:00,928, some time ago I remember someone was saying of a way to order and ship right from Vaughn store. Tim That may have been me. I've done it several times. Works great. You need to contact the shipping dept. I forget her name atm though. If it's in stock in that store she does the order up for you and shipping was very quick when I did it.  Cheers
