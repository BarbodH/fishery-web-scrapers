951794,Steve,2016-01-04 14:39:00,2075,"that is because of our junior hockey.  many leagues (mostly driven by ""moms"" and ""weak"" dads) want to remove body checking completely.  the ""concussion"" time of sports is alive and well.....Canada's physical play will reduce year after year until the idea of physical hockey in juniors is all but eliminated."
951816,Steve,2016-01-04 16:36:00,2075,and to Gold the Finns go!
951817,G.mech,2016-01-04 16:45:00,830,"Chedoke for sure.  The quad pads as well I believe.  But Chedoke twin pads, the one surface is Olympic size.  Oh yes, I forgot about Chedoke.   The quads are all NHL sized (85' wide).  I was looking for a big sheet for a summer program and couldn't find one, Chedoke didn't have summer ice which is why I was SOL....  Sorry for the minor hi-jack of the thread...... now back to team Canada!"
951818,G.mech,2016-01-04 16:52:00,830,"just because the European teams are playing finesse skill hockey does not mean that we have to.  Yes the game is evolving, but we cant forget that Canadian's make up 85% of the NHL.     Not meaning to split hairs but the NHL is now less than 50% Canadians about 20% Americans and 30% Europeans (& others).  It has changed dramatically in the last 30 years which may account for the game becoming more 'Europeanized'.  Here's a chart with the past and present breakdown:  http://www.quanthockey.com/TS/TS_PlayerNationalities.php"
951825,AKRISONER,2016-01-04 17:28:00,5558,"good call, still point out that 70 of the league is north american...and the swedes dont play a soft game...They are generally big and powerful but thanks for the chart...very good stuff"
951859,woodenboater,2016-01-04 21:52:00,2277,"fwiw, I'd sooner see Olympic style hockey (more end to end with some hits) that features more skillful passing and skating vs the usual physicality at all costs 'cuz canadians giv'r' mentality. and I'll be the first to admit that what clarke did to Kharlamov's ankle was absolutely disgusting. that's not my hockey and not how I want our games to be remembered. ymmv"
951869,muddler,2016-01-04 23:20:00,623,"When the players are encouraged with the ""New NHL"" mentality where the hitting is almost gone. End to end shiny is what is left. The toughness of the game is becoming obsolete. So many penalties are ""staged"" and according to the rules the offence is called. My personal favourite is the ""love tap"" on the opponents stick and it gets dropped. ...... slashing penalty...HOLD THE FREAKIN STICK...... Slap the opponents stick and it breaks......OPPS  PENALTY. A freaking $500 stick and it breaks like paper......gimme a break. Get a real piece of lumber. That didn't happen when the used wood sticks.  The head shots had to go as that is very dangerous but holy cow there are way too many ticky tack penalties that decide the outcome of the games. When we see a real good body check now, it's a rare thing and the crowd goes nuts. 20 years ago it was the way everybody played.  Hard hitting is a part of the game, and the NHL has changed that (call it European hockey if you like).  Our Juniors turned to body checking in the first period againsh the Finns. The momentum changed in our favour, trouble was we couldn't keep that up.  Time to get back to basics. Look who wins the Stanley cup...teams that get physical with a smattering of skill players. LA has won a few cups on pure toughness for example. The last thing I want to see is a team of Phil Kessels. And how's he doing ?   My 2 cents ......muddler"

952029,Steve,2016-01-06 01:40:00,2075,I. am. happy.  what a game.  best junior game I've seen in years...(since Eberle scored in 2009 i think)  the future is looking bright for Suomi.
952030,leaf4,2016-01-06 01:46:00,2466,"Also pleased with Kasperi Kapanen... Marner, Brown, Nylander, Kapanen the future is looking good! Hoping the leafs can somehow scoop up Alex nylander as well, kids got some skills"
952032,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-06 02:25:00,956,Steve you should be happy.  BOOOO Finland
952045,wormdunker,2016-01-06 07:44:00,1711,Awesome game!  That was the best game I've seen in a while.  Except last year when our boys brought home the gold!
952057,AKRISONER,2016-01-06 13:58:00,5558,mmmm that kessel deal just got sweeter for the leafs big time.
952129,Steve,2016-01-07 01:26:00,2075,"We already have Kapanen and Komarov...then maybe we get Laine, Puljujarvi, or Juolevi in the upcoming draft....  Strong, smart and talented Finns.  The future is looking bright."
952172,msp,2016-01-07 13:38:00,1336,"There is an old Finnish term "" SISU "" which means "" guts "" which the Finns have shown throughout the entire tournament. Way to go Finland !"

951481,wormdunker,2016-01-01 22:16:00,1711,"Yes unfortunately for our guys Sweden is a powerhouse.  Stevens goal in the first period is a prime example of getting more shots on the net.  A shot from the point & Stevens nets a nice rebound.  You can't score against Sweden with a man is in the box!  3 Canadian penalties - 3 goals for Sweden!  We had a 2 man advantage for :54 seconds , followed immediately by a 1 man advantage & couldn't score.  That's the proof!  We also had an opportunity when Sweden was short handed, but we didn't even get 1 shot on their net.  Going to be another great game against Finland tomorrow.  Go Canada Go!"
951538,Steve,2016-01-02 16:00:00,2075,"and now begins the best game of the tournament so far.  Puljujarvi, Laine, and Aho vs Canada.  My boys in blue playing my boys in red.  It's gonna be a good one!"
951544,leaf4,2016-01-02 17:23:00,2466,Stupid penalty to take by virtanen
951547,Steve,2016-01-02 18:05:00,2075,"Puljujarvi, Aho, and Laine .... best line in the tournament....  BUT, it kinda ends there for the Finns....Canada has better depth."
951552,muddler,2016-01-02 18:42:00,623,They done good. Played 110%. The last slashing penalty that the Finnish player's stick got knocked away was very iffy. I hate that whole dropping the stick thing on a love tap. Looks like a ringette ruie. Anyway we were right in it all the way.  The boys done good.  muddler
951555,Rodbender,2016-01-02 18:44:00,1027,Dumb penalties killed us best game they played buts stupid penalties did us in
951567,Steve,2016-01-02 19:41:00,2075,"Kinda lost some respect for Strome when he tried to sell the five minute penalty....you don't go directly to the dressing room to look injured while the refs are discussing whether to call 2 mins or 5 mins...then it was decided it was 2 mins....Strome was not just back on the bench, he was back on the ice for the next shift.  That isn't Canadian hockey.  But other than for that, the boys played their hearts out...Team Canada wasn't as strong as previous years.....and the boys still played their hearts out."
951592,fishboy,2016-01-02 21:47:00,550,too many trips to the box of shame
951593,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-02 21:54:00,956,Bad News: Team Canada is out Good News:  That Marner kid sure stepped it up.  I wonder which team drafted him?
951666,wormdunker,2016-01-03 05:30:00,1711,"Our guys played very well, but up against some tough opposition.  Swedes & Fins!  Penalties once again were our worst enemy.  Our guys had 9 penalties.  Virtanen's 4 minutes in the box didn't help the cause.  3 different times we had a man advantage only to be followed by a Canada penalty.  Well, it's definitely a learning experience for next year."

951732,woodenboater,2016-01-03 22:04:00,2277,"no, more a conspiracy theory if they let their juniors go to Europe but held ours back  it's kind of like the NHL and the Olympics, there's nothing in it for them financially and I can see them killing participation at some point."

And I'm pretty sure everyone of them players signed there contracts knowing that was the deal when they signed on the dotted line."
951785,Steve,2016-01-04 13:54:00,2075,"The NHL will not release ""needed"" players to play in a kids tournament.  The NHL teams are billion dollar industries ...  In fact, we'll see LESS players being released in years to come.  Russia, Canada, USA, Finland, and Sweden all had quality players that were junior eligible held back by their NHL clubs."
951786,Steve,2016-01-04 14:12:00,2075,and here we go ........... Lets Go Finns!

This is not a Cherry/Orr, show case event.  When you're signing these guys to multi million dollar contracts, the last thing you'd want is them being seriously hurt playing in the Juniors.  I can understand why the teams won't release them.  It sucks, but that's what happens."
951793,AKRISONER,2016-01-04 14:36:00,5558,"just because the European teams are playing finesse skill hockey does not mean that we have to.  Yes the game is evolving, but we cant forget that Canadian's make up 85% of the NHL.  We are getting away from what made us good and are trying to play a more european style of hockey. Back during the drive for 5 etc the canadians played a hard nosed tough forechecking game. A game where you grinded the european teams into oblivion. Size, physicality plus puck skills won it for us every time.  Now I am seeing a huge evolution in Junior Hockey. Yes its great to have great skill, but being one dimensional and scared to forecheck hard, and play shut down D is to the detriment of Canadian Hockey.Remember Eric Lindros at the Juniors?  The mentality amognst players is basically becoming a bunch of pretty boys that are out there to toe drag a snipe a Gino. Basically we are developing Nazem Kadris and patrick Kanes instead of toews and crosbys...its not good.  Anyone who wants to argue that the physical game doesnt work, or is disappearing...ask yourself who the best coaches in the NHL are and then ask yourself what style of game they play.  The Dallas' and the Montreals of the league just dont finish when it comes to the playoffs, you cant play soft hockey and win it all."
951175,lhousesoccer,2015-12-30 19:38:00,442,"So, how is it that we had to go all the way to a shootout yesterday to beat Switzerland 3-2, while the US are beating them 10-1 right now in the 2nd period?  Is the current crop of Canadian juniors not as dominant or talented?  I know the Swedes are favoured to take the gold this year, but it worries me that we had a hard to with SUI yesterday (down 2-0 at one point) while the US is running all over them."
951177,misfish,2015-12-30 19:58:00,29133,"I dont see gold for the byes. I think Silver is in thier reach, but would not be surprised if they get knocked out of the metals. Not seeing the high flying as years before.  There ya go. Thats how I see it."

Talent will only get you so far, the rest is chemistry. I like what I see our boys doing. Without the fluke third goal(yes, I know this happens all the time) against the USA and it would be a totally different game. It's not time to panic. All teams get UP for the Canadian teams. The oppositions usually play their best games against us.  Our boys always leave it all in the ice, a 100% effort. Regardless of the outcome they have done us proud. They WILL continue to play at their peak. Remember every team is trying to do the same. The most dangerous team in a short series is the team that's NOT supposed to win. Right now that's us.

Passes look sloppy, very few are tape-to-tape, and whoever said they need to shoot more is bang on. Way too much fancy dipsy doodling around with the puck when they could have and should have put the puck on net.  Down 2-0 to Sweden halfway through the 1st P right now by the way.  The way things are going, they might not even medal, let alone with gold this year."
