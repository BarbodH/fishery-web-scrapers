951608,esoxansteel,2016-01-02 23:31:00,1307,"Cigars, walleye, and cold beer looks fine to me"
951612,spincast,2016-01-02 23:42:00,3279,"Cigars, walleye, and cold beer looks fine to me X2, although I might switch the beer for a Thermos full of Irish coffee"
951613,Freshtrax,2016-01-02 23:49:00,2215,nice great way to spend a day
951614,Dozer,2016-01-02 23:50:00,896,Sweet dude
951631,Acountdeleted,2016-01-03 01:18:00,2562,You nabbed a walleye. Better then most of us today.
951635,Joeytier,2016-01-03 02:18:00,3990,Ouch!  Looks like Hally got hit with a good dumping too!  Did you launch your boat with the bravo?
951637,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-03 02:33:00,8243,"Great day for you, good going. A few more of those make a beauty pan fry. That must be diet Coke in those cans. I wonder if it's a coincidence all the folks I see open water fishing this winter don't have any grey whiskers? I remember casting onto patches of ice flow from Niagara to Nipp to Quinte and back. You pull the lure off them straight down. a killer technique. No grey then though. I'm happy to have grey hair, that means I still have some."
951638,Gallie,2016-01-03 02:35:00,1215,Awesome! Im waiting for my chance.
951640,Rod Caster,2016-01-03 02:38:00,5784,easier than launching a boat from sand... She must have glided nicely.  Desperation and deprivation will make ice fishermen do funny things
951665,wormdunker,2016-01-03 05:18:00,1711,That's awesome!  Nice walleye too!
951672,fishindevil,2016-01-03 10:42:00,6254,Nice way to spend New Years Chris !!!! Cheers man ?❄️?????

951755,can u fish,2016-01-04 01:57:00,326,Been thinking about doing the same thing Chris.  Cheers
951757,NAW,2016-01-04 02:14:00,4022,Good report Chris! Some cold nights ahead of us in my area.  Things could be looking up.  I am getting pretty punchy to be honest.  Going up to my spot for another look Wednesday morning. But I'm not hopeful.....
951767,limeyangler,2016-01-04 04:20:00,5204,LOL…great stuff Chris.
951782,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-04 13:40:00,8243,"Some will be happy to hear there was a skim of ice about 200 yards out from shore this AM. -14C at 07:00 when I took the garbage out. I'm frozen, ya happy now"
951831,AKRISONER,2016-01-04 17:43:00,5558,im glad all of this snow hit before the lock up...its way worse when you have 1 inch of ice and 2 feet of snow on it.
951843,EC1,2016-01-04 20:08:00,930,"Hey, a fish was caught! I was hoping to do that at some point this december but never made it out!"
