31037,lickmyarmpit,2007-02-05 16:14:00,359,Went out on the bay yesterday water was pretty muddy.  Did alright though was out for about 6 hours caught about a dozen jumbos.  Enough for a decent hut lunch will have to get out again once the water clears. Tons of huts out there already about a hundred.  Sorry about the quality of the pics i still havent got a new camera.
