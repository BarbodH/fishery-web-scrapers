Now...I didn't know he was coming then and I was in the shower at the time. I had mentioned to the Mrs. that Joe had offered to cut the lock off via a PM on OFC. I had missed him on the site so had left my number to call. So while I'm in the shower, my wife comes in and hands me the cut lock. I asked where Joe was and she said he had already left.  I didn't even get a chance to say thanks! So thank you Joe very, very much Joe. You're a class act!"
30882,joefish,2007-02-05 03:17:00,165,"You are very welcome sir! No big deal, just doing what any one else would have done, helped another human being..."
30885,tjsa,2007-02-05 03:25:00,1578,"Thats great Rick, but, now you haven't any excuses as to why you have not snowblowed the driveway.  But, you can always blame joefish for that, lol."
30886,irishfield,2007-02-05 03:28:00,26272,If you were in the shower...are you sure it's the lock off the shed !  . . . .  Good show Joe! Carry bolt cutters in the car eh....hmmmm LOL
30887,jjcanoe,2007-02-05 03:32:00,744,Maybe he wanted to borrow the snowblower!  jjcanoe
30898,tjsa,2007-02-05 03:42:00,1578," :lol:  Never thought of that, did you check to see if your snowblower is still in the garage Rick?????  Maybe joefish is using it to make extra money clearing other peoples driveways  :w00t:"
30901,danc,2007-02-05 03:48:00,4677,Maybe we'd better start a fund raiser to buy Rick a pair of bolt cutters. I'd hate to see this scenario play out again. I'll start with a $1.00 contribution. Anyone else??
30905,irishfield,2007-02-05 03:53:00,26272,He'd just store them in the shed anyhow Dan !
30906,danc,2007-02-05 03:55:00,4677, :thumbsup_anim:
30907,bigfish1965,2007-02-05 03:57:00,3382,Ha ha...the funny part is I gotta dig all the snow out from in front of the shed!
30919,tjsa,2007-02-05 04:39:00,1578," Yup, thats funny alright, but where did you store the shovels, that you would use, to clear out the snow, from in front of the shed????????"
30923,Carp,2007-02-05 05:09:00,1488,Very nice gesture Joe.  Clear the snow in front of the shed to get the snow blower out ?  Talk about irony.
30935,Clampet,2007-02-05 09:56:00,1947,That wasn't Joe Fish
30945,Big Cliff,2007-02-05 11:20:00,6899,"As per the title of the thread; ""This is what makes OFC great!"""
30950,ChrisK,2007-02-05 11:55:00,2772,Now if I could only get Joe to drive down here to Dutton and cut the lock off my shed..... I just lost the key all together !!!!! 
30956,huey graphite,2007-02-05 12:32:00,362,   Shovel in the shed....shed blocked by snow.....That's more ironic than a one legged waitress working at the IHOP.
30957,Whopper,2007-02-05 12:32:00,2174,Good on you Joefish!  With the way the story started with Rick in the shower and Joe with the bolt cutters.....well I was just glad it was the lock that got cut off  Whopper
