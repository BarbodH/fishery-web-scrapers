First of all it is little bit cold outside, but this I can handle, what is worst I have cold myself. Since Saturday morning I’ve tried to cure myself with my “home made medicine”  , and it looks that it works. Today I feel  much, much better. I still won’t go ice fishing, but I do not see any reason to waste such a beautiful day.  In the dark corners of my fishing treasure chest   I’ve found some lure making supplies and decided to do something about this.  WARNING:  THIS is my first attempt (I already know what I did wrong), so you can Look at it, admire it  , copy it if you want, but only constructive criticism will be accepted :rolleyes:        "
30708,iceguy,2007-02-04 18:13:00,341,Nice lures. Now you got to do the tank trial. You want those blades spinning on the slowest retrieve. Must be pretty rewarding catching fish on lures you made.
30746,Smokey,2007-02-04 21:29:00,1278,Nice job. Make sure you show us the results when you land one.
