31087,OhioFisherman,2007-02-05 17:09:00,6623,Don`t waste time trying to catch your own!
31112,Bernie,2007-02-05 17:47:00,3190,Cant say as I have ever tried them in winter. They are a little hard to come by here.  But thats all I use in summer so why not winter ?
31128,Sherriff,2007-02-05 18:17:00,252,"We had a bunch last weekend on Callendar.  Nothing on worms, not even a bite.  Everything we managed was on minnows.  When we go up for the May opener, that's all the eyes will take is worms.  Not sure I understand walleye....  Sherriff"
31178,Fishnfiend,2007-02-05 19:33:00,357,Take some grubs or mealworms.
