Since January 2nd I decided to lose my salesman gut so I had to change my ways and this has been tough.I am not eating much good junk food .I have lost 13lbs so far and it took alot of dicipline to get there.I bring a healthy lunch with me mostly rabbit food but its working.I cut the fat and calories.4 times a week I use my treadmill 30 minutes a day.  January 2nd 2007 I weighed 194lbs.  Today I weigh 181lbs.  Although I miss all the goodies I feel much better and I am less tired at the end of the day.  Like to hear from you Gals and Guys.  I miss chips,Beer and most of all dipping cookies in Milk.  Mike"

30698,hawkeye,2007-02-04 17:05:00,162,"Mike, like you I made the loose weight resolution. Now with type 2 diabetes riding my back I have no choice. After two weeks blood sugar is normal and I’m down a few pounds. Working on the treadmill 20-30 minutes most days helps. Oddly I feel better than I have in years. Due to the med’s I have to limit the beer and wine. In researching this disease I found that there are a lot of things that can be eaten, in Moderation. I can’t chow down half a pizza and a six pack, but I can have a piece or two and a light beer.  So this is a resolution that has morphed into a lifestyle change, but consider the alternates……………"
30709,fishergirl72,2007-02-04 18:16:00,455,"Well I have been really trying to stick to my resolutions, I have stumbled a couple of times but I go right back and try again, I am not the type just to quit, because I stumbled a few times."
