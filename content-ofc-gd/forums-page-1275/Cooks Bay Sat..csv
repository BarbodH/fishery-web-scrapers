31022,Bitsmith2k,2007-02-05 15:46:00,396,"me and two buddies had it planned to get out on cook's for a day of perchin on sat. one buddy dropped out due to work reasons, so it was just a two man show.. got up there and on the ice for about 8:30.. drilled the first set of holes and within 30 secs i had a nice 10"".. I'm thinking 'damn headhunter was right' got him on a jiggin rap with a couple power grubs on the treble.. figured it was gonna be a good day.. my buddy didnt want to wander around drilling holes so we stayed at our first spot all day.. after a couple hours in the wind, with only one more fish, i was starting to get a little cold.. so i wandered back to shore to get minnows (best move of the day).. once we started droppin the minnows down to about a foot off the bottom, we had a change of luck.. we ended up keeping close to 30 eaters for dinner.. i only managed a couple photos due to the camera freezing up, will add them when i can get them off of it.. ended up losing my rain pants (wore them to help with the wind) the wind / cold was too much for them and they froze and ripped off..  all and all a good but cold day.. cant wait to get back up there.."
31025,Terry,2007-02-05 15:50:00,14456,yeah cold and windy...good you stuck it out and got into them as I always say when in doult...use minnows
31028,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-05 15:53:00,1351,didn't sound too bad! too bad on the rain pants though. I never really heard of them freezing and ripping apart. sounds odd. lol
31032,Bitsmith2k,2007-02-05 16:00:00,396,"  they were cheep plastic pants, the wind & cold combined with spilling water from the minnows probably did them in.. i've already washed and readied my 'good' pants for the next time.."
31034,ccmtcanada,2007-02-05 16:02:00,7971,Great report!!  It was way too cold for me to be out there.  Good on you guys to tough it out....it paid off in the end.
