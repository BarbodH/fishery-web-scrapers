30973,misfish,2007-02-05 14:03:00,29133,"What a beauty of a day,fresh snow,turkeys in the trees and the sun was a shine,n. Terry and I pack the bike up and head out.    Off we ride into the sunrise,with his rose coloured glasses.Lots of snow up there  Saturday folks,and I'm sure there is plenty more after yesterdays 2+ feet of dumping of snow.  Anyhoo, back to the day of fishing. Alls well til we get to the spot,  :o ,oh no were going through,  :o  Turnes out just to be lots of water on the ice under all the presure from the snow. We get a jigg,n and terry with his wonder machine 67X, says theres a fish,reels up and wham,fish on. Nice slab to start the day.   An hour or so goes by,we drill more holes,no action to be had. Terry,s playing with something on the bike and   :o I get a hookset on a fine little slab myself.    About 15 minutes later,I get this sudden stop while I'm jigg,n,set the hook and the battle was on what we thought was the king of all king crappies. Well it wasn't,but it was a nice 3+ pound bucket.     Quick release at the hole,and off she went. With the light breeze becoming wind gusts,we set up the clam and finish our day in it.Marked alot of fish,but they just were not active.They were not suspended,they were hugging the bottom. The last crappie for the day goes to Terry.    Cant wait to do it again."

31005,Terry,2007-02-05 15:17:00,14456,but as always something breaks or goes wrong with my equipment had to McGiver something to replace the bolt       and even though there hasn't been an above zero day in 3 weeks we still found some slushy wet areas on the lake at first I thought we were going through...not happy thoughts when that is happening  
31011,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-05 15:25:00,0,Nice report Brian and Terry.  Scary about the ice....
31042,OhioFisherman,2007-02-05 16:19:00,6623,"Terry do they have TSC farm stores near you? Grade 8 bolts are a lot stronger than a grade 2 or 5, a grade 8 in that thing, if it didn`t already have one might not break when you need it most. Other places like a nut and bolt(fastner suppy) will have them too."
