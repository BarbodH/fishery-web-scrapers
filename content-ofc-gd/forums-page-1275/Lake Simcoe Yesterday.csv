It was slow but the fish were around. I got one hit, then a whitie iced.    A while later, while bigchev decides to have a had full of peanuts, he gets a fish on, but with hands full, he tossed the peanuts in his mouth, but by then, he lost the fish... lol  He then tries to curse an swear with a mouth full.... I was laughing so hard...  The winds out there were unbearable, I don't know how the dye hards stay out in it as long as they do...  A great day out for us having the fish hut for shelter and warmth...  Back out today... good luck to those going out, the winds are suppost to be bad again..  Safe fishing First..."
