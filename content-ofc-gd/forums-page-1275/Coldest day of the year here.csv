30624,OhioFisherman,2007-02-04 13:14:00,6623,"Winter took it`s time giving us serious cold, 0 f this morning with a windshield of 22 below. The Penn State groundhog and Buckeye Chuck didn`t see their shadows so an early spring.  Buddies bass fished until January 6th, a first."
30635,Smokey,2007-02-04 13:50:00,1278,"Winter has finally taken hold. I remember a few weeks back in the warmer weather everyone was saying it was suppose to be like that all winter, boy did that change fast."
30642,tjsa,2007-02-04 14:12:00,1578," Umm, Paul,   :lol:  You're still in the banana belt compared to me btw.  Its 26 below Farenheit up here right now, with a high of 9 below forecasted for today. Finally had to plug in the car last night."
30651,OhioFisherman,2007-02-04 14:30:00,6623,"LOL Tom, yes banana belt! Considering I could probably make it down to visit with Glenn in less time than getting to you. Well a normal person could, I need my naps.  My first GMC Safari van had the block heater on it, nice, heat as soon as you start it up."
30656,danc,2007-02-04 14:38:00,4677, And Tom lives on the warm side of town..
30662,lew,2007-02-04 14:50:00,12767,Windchill of 22 below is very cold and it doesn't really matter how cold it is anywhere else.
30670,OhioFisherman,2007-02-04 15:17:00,6623,"Ya Lew! I can`t imagine trying to fight a fire in weather like this, I have seen some pictures though. It was cold on the truck docks, but at least dry!  LOL Dan, one of the car dealerships nearby always advertises as in Tropical Medina because it`s south of Cleveland, not far enough south today! Warm side of town?"
30673,lew,2007-02-04 15:27:00,12767," Paul, back in the day, some of our trucks had no roofs, heaters or defrosters on them.  Makes driving kinda  tough when your trying to change gears and have no feeling in your feet or hands and you've got 8"" of snow in your lap and on top of your helmet.  The good ole days weren't always that good"
30676,OhioFisherman,2007-02-04 15:39:00,6623,"LOL Lew, ya trucks used to suck much more than today. LOL ours always had roofs!, getting a heater or defroster that would keep that big windshield clear seemed to be a real problem for the engineers."
30684,lew,2007-02-04 15:59:00,12767,"Yeah Paul, I always figured the guys who designed those old convertible trucks was probably doing it from a nice warm office in Arizona or something, rather than having to actually drive them in frigid temperatures.  Lots different today though, I understand our new aerials are well over a million $$$$ apiece.  I think I joined up about 40 years too soon"
30757,tjsa,2007-02-04 21:49:00,1578,Took this pic this morning shortly before I left home to go to work.  
30773,pameladallaire,2007-02-04 22:45:00,470,"Everyone in Timmins better plug in their cars. Monday will be,  Wind chill minus 47 in the morning and minus 34 in the afternoon.  Pam"
30791,ecmilley,2007-02-04 23:45:00,2163,the thermometer in my truck registrered -17c this morning not taking into account the 60 or so km/h winds this morning still didn't stop me from putting 200km on the sled today
30836,irishfield,2007-02-05 01:22:00,26272,You did buy the cold weather package for that new vehicle of yours Paul? Better plug it in if you're going out tomorrow !
30877,motv8tr,2007-02-05 03:12:00,2587," paul, I could make it to Glen's faster than I could to see Tom  and frankly at this point and time, that's a trip i'd like to make  Maureen"
30926,OhioFisherman,2007-02-05 05:21:00,6623,"LOL Wayne, momma don`t let me out on days like this, as slow as I move I could freeze walking to the car. I don`t feel my feet well any way, they might freeze and I might not know.  Both my kids schools called today and said schools will be closed Monday due to the weather conditions, doesn`t look good for Tuesday either.  Moe if you make the run to warm weather(glen`s) stop and warm up here on the way, wood burners going! LOL  Stay warm watch your pets, bad days for them to be out too!"
