I am planning to head up there at about 4 am, but my buddy needs a new license and we need some minnows.  Any recent reports?  Thanks for any help,  Also look for two frozen guys in orange flotation suits if you are up there!"
30603,brandon,2007-02-04 05:22:00,857,check out the MNR store online.  Credit card and a printer is all you need.  I'm not sure of the exact link to the store but go to www.mnr.gov.on.ca and im sure you'll be able to find your way around.

All the money they spent on their website and they couldn't use a programmer that knows the way around the syntax error created by someone with a name like O'Malley!
