30739,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-02-04 21:11:00,0,I have the LCX25C ( same unit with smaller 7 inch screen ) and you will be amassed of how accurately you can read bottom. Before there was a lot of guess work and only knowing but after watching it for hundreds of hours to figure what is down there. With the color screen and great resolution you will be able to see bait fish on bottom as well as on the drop offs.  P.S. Please note that for some reason every time you touch the screen it leaves greasy fingerprints and even after you wipe them they are still somewhat visible for some time later.
30745,Smokey,2007-02-04 21:26:00,1278,I've found the same thing as Richard with anything on the screen. It's almost like the lowrance absorbs it so I keep a little bottle of windex and a rag handy. Even rain drops on it can sometimes leave a mark.
30845,fishindevil,2007-02-05 02:07:00,6254,"great powerfull unit squid,you will see things your other graph never would...and yes i wonder why the lowrance screens do that every lowrance unit i have ever owned has done that???? lets send them an e-mail all at once and see what they say to us..with my new 339 dumb ass/IGPS  unit i got a special little cloth for wiping the screen its real soft so it wont scratch it...cheers"
