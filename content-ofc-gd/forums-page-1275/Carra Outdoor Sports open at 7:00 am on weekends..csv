We are now open at 7:00 am on Saturdays and Sundays to accomodate all those that are ice fishing.  We had quite a storm yesterday and the walleye were not as active yesterday as it was other days. I fished at Peats Point in the morning and at Deseronto in the afternoon and evening and not many fish were being caught by anyone.  Hope to see some of you on the ice and remember to be safe.  Best regards, Sam"

I am going to get out a couple of times this week and hopefully I will have a more positive report to post.  Regards, Sam"
