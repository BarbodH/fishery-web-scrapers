The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, in conjunction with the  Ontario government, are encouraging everyone to drop a line Feb. 24-25.  ""Many Ontarians enjoy winter fishing as a  sport and social activity and parents and others across the province  can take this opportunity to introduce children and young adults to the  fun of fishing,"" said MNR Minister David Ramsay.  Canadian residents will be able to fish licence-free in any public waters across Ontario on Feb. 24-25.  The original concept for Ontario Family Fishing Weekend was presented by the OFAH.    During the family fishing weekend, anglers must continue to follow the  conservation licence limits set out in the 2005- 2006 Recreational  Fishing Regulations Summary.
