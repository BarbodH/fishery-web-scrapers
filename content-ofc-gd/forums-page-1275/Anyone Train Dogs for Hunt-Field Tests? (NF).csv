30996,Big Cliff,2007-02-05 15:08:00,6899,"I'd be happy to help you anyway I can.  I have worked with several field dogs and own a GSP; Katiebow's Andy CKC-FDJ,FD, Canadian Show Champion. NAVHDA-NA, UT. Plus a wall full of ribbons and awards. (doesn't mean I'm smart but he sure is LOL). (P.S., I didn't train him, he taught me how to tell him what I wanted and how to ask for it.)  Andy is now 10 and we don't push each other too hard anymore but 30 seconds of ""OK lets do some work and have some fun"" and he remembers every trick he ever learned and most of the ones I've forgotten!  What sort of dog do you have and what do you want to accomplish? How old is it and is it male or female?  What experience do you have working with dogs?"
