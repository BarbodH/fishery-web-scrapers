30797,tjsa,2007-02-04 23:58:00,1578,"That doesn't sound like much of a threat Art, more like a promise. Can we hold you to that???"
30803,Roy,2007-02-05 00:09:00,13728,"Art, you don't happen to know which temperature Bubba wears a shirt at do ya? Dat's de temp I want."

30827,jjcanoe,2007-02-05 00:51:00,744,"Hey don't blame us, we import all of our cold weather from Alaska and then warm it up a little and resell it back to you guys!  jjcanoe"

30829,Greencoachdog,2007-02-05 00:59:00,8163,"  Sometime more than that! 60*F will freeze yer nadz off if you're used to a 100+*F heat index!... Oh how I wish I could bring some nice 'Bama August weather up to Lakair with me, the best description I've heard was ""like trying to breathe with your head in a bucket of mud""... and I triple dog dare any Canadians to come down during the month of August and just follow me around at work and on the lake, you would die! Just like I would if outside up there like I do down here.     BTW... I am getting pretty tired of these lows in the low to mid 20's every night and highs only in the mid 40's-50's. Y'all knock it off and gimme my nice warm blanky back!!!"
30834,jjcanoe,2007-02-05 01:19:00,744," Been there done that.  Eufaula AL, August Don't know what the temp was, AC in the truck was not working couldn't sleep more than about 15 mins straight that night, the next day at my pick-up they had a power outage over the weekend and the electric forklift didn't charge fully and died with a a half loaded semi- trailer.  The solution, was to hand bomb about 22,000lbs of veneer onto my trailer.  At least we were out of the sun.  Hotter than hell!  jjcanoe"
30847,motv8tr,2007-02-05 02:20:00,2587," Anytime Glen, anytime...I love the heat...sure beats these minus 20's to minus 30's here to go with the foot of snow I've had in the last 24hrs.  And Art, do your worste buddy, do your worste...just think how much business we're drumming up for you with the cold blast  , you should be thanking us and bringing us gifts in june  Maureen"
30852,Roy,2007-02-05 02:29:00,13728,I'm thinking autographed toilet plungers....in firetiger.
30899,bigfish1965,2007-02-05 03:42:00,3382," Even Canadians think that is just a bit silly. Minus 47!!!!!!! I might even have to wear gloves tomorrow, dang it."
30908,douG,2007-02-05 04:00:00,2693,"I prefer this to the stuff that GCD  and jjcanoe were talking about.  I can put on stuff to stay warm, but that oppressive heat and humidity is just miserable, no escape.  In lovely suburban Etobicoke right now, it's a brisk -15C /  -5F tonight.  Goretex, fleece, toques, gloves, mittens, balaclavas, fur and even the zipper were invented right here in the Great White North.  Get out there and get some fresh air, for Heaven's sake.  Breathing with your head in a bucket of mud---that's funny right there."
30946,Greencoachdog,2007-02-05 11:22:00,8163,  Balaclava... that's that greasy layered pastry from the Middle East... right?
30951,aplumma,2007-02-05 11:55:00,6896,Yea I guess threatening y'all with heat when its sub zero ain't much of a threat is it.....kind of like bringin a knife to a gun fight. Hows about I make it warm enough for Glen to fish nekkid? Of all the plumbin jobs frozen pipes are the worst. You already know that you will get wet and the area you are workin is below freezing so were is the joy it's just hard money. The good side is people are really grateful when they have water again.  Art
30967,pikehunter,2007-02-05 13:26:00,1659,"We all like to blame it on the weatherman/woman. Not their fault, it's really a plot of us Northerners to overthrow the American government!  If we get our way then we can all go south to hibernate till spring so we can go winter fishing in our T-shirts.  Stay warm eh!"
30981,OhioFisherman,2007-02-05 14:19:00,6623,"LOL PikeHunter, we want your water, but don`t want to have to bring chainsaws to cut it!"
30995,wuchikubo,2007-02-05 15:04:00,1114,"LOL!  Thanks everyone for the morning laugh!  This thread exhibits why this site if the BEST fishing forum sites on the net!  Good thing I don't drink coffee, it may have been spilt while reading this thread.  Oh wait, that would have to be iced coffee with this weather!  HF"
