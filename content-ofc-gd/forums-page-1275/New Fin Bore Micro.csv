30404,Clampet,2007-02-03 18:18:00,1947,"Picked up a new Normark Finbore Micro-Drill.  It collapses to just 19.5 inches, which makes it a dream to pack.  "
30410,lew,2007-02-03 18:36:00,12767,"Pretty snazzy Clampet, and should lighten your load alot while hiking across the ice !!"
30421,douG,2007-02-03 18:59:00,2693,The offset handle is definitely the way to go.  Nice gear.
30429,snoil,2007-02-03 19:11:00,139,If you don't mind me asking where did you buy it? I've been thinking of buying one because my 6 year old son keeps bugging me to go ice fishing and an auger would make it esaier to get out without booking something.
30436,ch312,2007-02-03 19:38:00,1590,id rather use a normal size fin bore so i dont have to get on my knees to drill a hole
30439,tjsa,2007-02-03 19:47:00,1578," CTC has them, for $99.99  http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...D=1170531821963"
30513,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-03 22:59:00,1351,i believe you can pricematch CTC with lebarons for $69.99 i think. and ctc will beat it by 10% the difference.
30519,Clampet,2007-02-04 00:17:00,1947, This auger telescopes to regular lenght. No need to get on my knees (at least not for fishing)
30520,Clampet,2007-02-04 00:18:00,1947," Lebarons, $84.94. 6""."
30707,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-04 18:06:00,1351,"afterlooking more into it, im kind of regretting of getting the regular swede bore. shouldve bought this one instead!! anyone want to buy mine? =)"
30766,mason05,2007-02-04 22:17:00,258,Nice little auger you got there.  Love the portability factor.  Is that OJ's glove?!?!  Corn Nug
30769,urbanangler1990,2007-02-04 22:28:00,933,"cool, does it come in 8 inch?"
30812,Clampet,2007-02-05 00:29:00,1947, Uh huh it does.
30817,urbanangler1990,2007-02-05 00:33:00,933," aha ok thanx, i may consider, cus its tuff to carry around a normal one, or maybe i should just buy a sled..."
30958,ricoboxing,2007-02-05 12:44:00,398,"nice auger clampet. i think normark owes me some comission for the sale, and product demo  !!"
30988,Fishmaster,2007-02-05 14:37:00,920,I don't think its going to work very well once the ice get 2 1/2 to 3 ft thick ..  but sure looks good for 1st ice ..
30997,rob v,2007-02-05 15:11:00,535,"Can anyone report how well it works ?  I've got a strikemaster lazer and really like it, but it's a 7 inch and when the ice gets thick and you're on your 15th hole the 'ole arms really start to sting.   I,m thinking for panfish/perch 6"" or less might be a bit easier on the system."
31000,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-05 15:15:00,1351,"same here, i got a 8inch auger, might downsize to a 6 or 4, ice is getting thick! and tiring"
31002,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-05 15:15:00,1351,"and when i say downsize, i meant get another one as well.."
