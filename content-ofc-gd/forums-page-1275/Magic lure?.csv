30146,Crazyhook,2007-02-02 20:41:00,1154,myfavorite musky bait of all time has been discountined ( both the way its made an the color) I have about 16 substitues but its not the same...
30170,lookinforwalleye,2007-02-02 22:26:00,4399,I have a few of those magic lures as well and all they did was magically remove more money from my wallet.  Give me a spinnerbait and or a jig and i will catch fish (why then do i have 5 tackle boxes full of stuff ?)
