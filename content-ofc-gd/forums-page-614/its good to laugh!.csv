He really loves watching himself on screen, he found it really funny when he says ""eeeeew"" about kissing the fish we were cleaning....had my wife and me laughing along too...precious moments!  I did a video of the original clip then Jack and mum and dad watching it with him...i just love it!   <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiaRZCkiE70?hl=en&fs=1""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiaRZCkiE70?hl=en&fs=1""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiaRZCkiE70?hl=en&fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""425"" height=""344""></embed></object>"
