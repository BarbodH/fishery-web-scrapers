517750,Kwan,2010-11-05 16:57:00,132,"Hey guys, after all that commotion about keeping fish alive, I'm slightly apologetic and somewhat thankful.  Here's some pics from last night's outing           They went strait on ice from the stringer   edit: in case you were wondering, they are all in the slot size"
517754,Kwan,2010-11-05 17:07:00,132,thanks for the heads up.	btw ones a bullhead
517755,mercman,2010-11-05 17:08:00,7054,"  Holy crap !!! Are you serious?......I,m  gonna start golfing. Less to remember. Nice catch Kwan."
517757,Kwan,2010-11-05 17:10:00,132,Btw my buddy has the sporting tag  
517761,Gerritt,2010-11-05 17:17:00,6129, if they are IN the slot.. Then you cannot keep them!
517763,misfish,2010-11-05 17:20:00,29133,     Nice catch Kwan.
517764,fishnsled,2010-11-05 17:21:00,3520," Depends on the area G.  For some lakes the slot is to be released, others it's a keep slot.  Anything above or below the slot must go back.  Most of the Kawartha's are a keep slot.  Nice catch Kwan"
517773,young_one,2010-11-05 17:40:00,620,"Nice catch, especially if you were shore fishing!"
517797,Terry,2010-11-05 18:11:00,14456,nice catch
517828,Gerritt,2010-11-05 19:52:00,6129,I stand corrected... I have Nipissing on the brain.
517883,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-05 23:28:00,0,Thanks for the report Kwan. Looks like you guys are doing pretty good. I assume they are caught on worms?  The biggest walleye I ever caught on GB had one eye.
517930,limeyangler,2010-11-06 01:46:00,5204,"Nice fish Kwan...keep up the good work....since the chemical (mercury) spill a few years back...nobody i know fishes too close to the mill, its reported you catch walleye with 3 eyes...called walleye,eye,eye"
517942,cram,2010-11-06 02:54:00,1733,This board is full of hall monitors!!!  Nice fish Kwan.  How do you cook the catfish?  I've never had one.
517965,Rod Caster,2010-11-06 05:12:00,5784,  Good one Simon.  What do you call a fish with three eyes?   A fiiish   Nice catching Kwan....you are a shore fishing ambassador.   Cram: Catfish baked in cajun spice is taaaasty! (insert fish eating emoticon)
517983,Jewelbee,2010-11-06 12:28:00,422,Come on.... Why the accusatory tone? Try sending congrats instead of criticism!
517998,limeyangler,2010-11-06 13:59:00,5204,  What do you call a deer with no eyes?    NO IDEA    What do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs?    STILL NO IDEA   HHAAAHHHAAAA....i love that joke
518048,Kwan,2010-11-06 19:25:00,132,"as long as the slime is salted off, any way to cook them is good  =( the walleye season is coming to a close and its getting real cold to fish  i wonder what i'll do with my time  as for possession limits, its almost impossible to keep a full limit with a sporting license fishing from shore, unless you stockpile them.  we've been seeing a lot of perch sized walleye lately as well-  its a hectic bait stealing experience"
