This season I was unable to get out nearly half as much as planned. The couple of mornings I managed to get out though, the specs did not let me down.  Hope you enjoy....                              Gotta love the sunglasses and hunting hat gangsta pose"

518081,Rich,2010-11-06 22:27:00,3927,"Wow, never really speck fished in October. Oh yeah, that's cuz the season's closed. Great pics!"
518083,S.M.05,2010-11-06 22:41:00,145, Rich Im lucky enough to have some of the lakes open yr round in my area. The reason is because the fish are not able to reproduce in those lakes.  Tight lines. Mike

518522,S.M.05,2010-11-09 00:52:00,145,"Thanks for all the great replies.  Really liked my old nikon but they did not have a pocket size with a decent zoom so I switched to the Pana. Now on my third one. Most of the time dont even use the full res. off the camera. I like the wide as it fits most of the new displays better and is great for wide scenery.  camillj Im fishing Eastern Ontario, Lanark to Bancroft."
