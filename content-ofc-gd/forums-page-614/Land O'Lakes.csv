But in the evenings I will be free and would love to wet a few lures.  My unit has been donated 2 cottages at Land O’Lakes.  I’ve seen posts about Land O’Lakes before, and was hoping I could get some advice.  I wont have a boat.  I was just wondering if it’s worth my while to cast from the docks at the lodge?  Any chance of catching walters from shore at or near the lodge?  If so, any suggestions on lures?  I was thinking a small husky jerk, or mepps spinner tipped with a minnow.  Keeping in mind that it’s going to be dark out, and I’ll be on a dock, or shoreline somewhere."
