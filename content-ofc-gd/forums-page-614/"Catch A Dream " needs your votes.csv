Aviva Insurance is funding some community projects and we're trying to obtain some funding for the ""Catch a Dream! Kids Fishing Derby. The results is all based on votes received.  You can vote up to 10 times a day.  We need your help so please take 2 minutes, follow the link below and vote. http://www.avivacommunityfund.org/ideas/acf7951  only thing, i think you can only vote for one project per day, at least that is what happened to me. Please take the time to register and vote time is running out... Thanks all  ps, sorry for posting so late, I just received the info myself...every vote counts though !"
