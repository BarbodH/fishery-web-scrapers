They don't cover some northern areas including this river. Does anyone have an idea of how to get a decent map? So I can look at it, and dream, through the long winter. thanks"
518138,irishfield,2010-11-07 02:02:00,26272,Doesn't give you much detail.. but it would probably help you plan a route. Zoom and zoom and zoom...  http://www.lio.ontario.ca/imf-ows/imf.jsp?site=clupa_en
