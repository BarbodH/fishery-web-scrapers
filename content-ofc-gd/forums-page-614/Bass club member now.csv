517095,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-03 12:36:00,0,"After two years of trying? I finally joined a bass club! Anyone here belong to the CBAF bass club(BPS club)? Went to my first meeting and we had a seminar from Joe Muszynski & Mark Moran. The guys that won the Simcoe Open. Really enjoyed it.  I have all new gear and looking forward to fishing next year. All I need now is a boat! The good news is if I don't get a boat(more then likely I will), I get to fish with some of the pros!"
517106,GBW,2010-11-03 12:59:00,8460,"I was a member of that BPS chapter a few years ago.  I just don't have the time anymore to keep it up.  Say ""hi"" to Albert next meeting for me.  And if you get a chance to fish with Alvin T, take it! Geoff"
517111,walleyemen,2010-11-03 13:27:00,316,"Good to here John, Bass clubs are great to be part of and honestly you learn a ton by being a non-boater and getting to fish with many great boaters!Congrats!!!"
517113,OhioFisherman,2010-11-03 13:29:00,6623,"Congrats Johnny! It is a good way to learn. Don`t expect to win or do well every time out, but always give it your best effort."
517116,EC1,2010-11-03 13:42:00,930,"Good for you man! I joinEd another club myself a few months ago, and enjoyed it very much myself.  If you feel like you want to learn more, it's amazing what you can learn for just fishing with a guy for one day. The best part is the boater will do anything they can to teach you to put fish into the boat. I had a one day lesson of the dropshot of which was a technique that was used twice before by me, and now it is amongst myfavourite techniques to use"
517118,charlesn,2010-11-03 13:44:00,551,"Congrats Johnny, hope you enjoy your time in the CBAF.  I think you will."
517171,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-03 17:46:00,0,"Thanks guys. Looking forward to it. I don't expect to win any tourneys or anything(but win or lose I love competition), since there are guys that fish much more then me, but looking to learn some new stuff. I usually learn something new fishing with different people. I know I learned alot from Snagmasteral and I'm sure he learned a thing or two from me.  Anyways, cant wait for next May! This year will give ice fishing a try(I say that every year but this time I bought lures,rods and reels). But I have a feeling I wont like it."
517186,steverowbotham,2010-11-03 18:48:00,1800, Thats DR. Alvin T
517189,GBW,2010-11-03 18:59:00,8460,"LOL, correct."
517192,batoathome,2010-11-03 19:02:00,47,is there a bass club in woodbridge?  I know of one in Mississuaga but woodbridge is closer for me.
517196,misfish,2010-11-03 19:16:00,29133,Look forward to your reports next year.Your going to have a blast.
517211,charlesn,2010-11-03 20:26:00,551, The Vaughan club would be closest to Woodbridge.  That's the one Johnny Bass just joined.  Incoming president is Chonger.  You can PM him here - he's an OFNer.
517236,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-03 21:46:00,0," As Charles said, the BPS one I attended is in Woodbridge. What Charles means by Chonger is Dave Chong. If your really interested, you should join ASAP and they can hook you up with magazines and all that good stuff in January. If you want Dave's number you can email him or email me and I may have his number somewhere.  I think the meetings for this year are done, but they are having a Christmas party in Dec($80) and after that a little meeting."

Batoatorne, we are as close to Woodbridge as you can get, let me know if you need any more info. We can have an application e-mailed to you if you want to get started. The faster that we get you in the system the faster you'll start receiving your FLW mag.  Richard, we missed you at the last meeting, hope that you can make the Xmas party!  Cheers, Dave"
