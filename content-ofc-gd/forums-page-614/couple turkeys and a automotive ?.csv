518213,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-07 17:55:00,1107,Hey guys any mechanics on here? can ya help me out my FWD drive ford escape has been really noisey while driving for awhile (thought it was the tires) and today I had a closer look and it looks to me like the lower control arm bushings are shot so here's a couple pics first is jacked up with tire off second is on the ground.Oh ya the noise quiets down if you turn 1 way any ways here's the pics.       and ran into about 20 of these guys in 2 groups while I was checking out the creek      couldn't believe they just strolled along off into the corn feild like we weren't even there

518240,greenfshrmn,2010-11-07 21:54:00,65,"The bushing has pushed up out of the control arm. That rusty ring part is supposed to be inside the control arm which is now contacting the bracket creating the noise you hear.  Needs a new bushing.  Not a hard fix, but you'll have to remove the arm to do it properly."
518243,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-07 22:04:00,1107,Thanks that's what I thought. Would this be able to pass a safety cause I bought it like this. Taking it in tomorrow I don't have time to many steelhead to catch right now LOL
518303,skeeter,2010-11-08 01:36:00,1907,"im not a mechanic but i would say NO WAY. if i am right, the shop that did the safety now has to fix it at there expense.."
518306,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-08 01:46:00,1107,unfortunately Skeeter I have been driveing it for a year like this should have called them on it when I first noticed it suprisinly other than the noisey ride there's no other damage tires aren't worn badly or anything CV axles look fine and tierods and struts all look good hope this isn't to expensive though don't want to take away any of my fishing gas $$$
518307,speckchaser,2010-11-08 01:50:00,17,"Working for Honda, the '01 to '05 Civics tear the bushings out. We charge 2 hours per side plus alignment. So for a Honda it would be $400 + $50 for bushing and $99.95 for the alignment"
518311,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-08 01:55:00,1107,wow good thing I'm taking it to my buddies shop that doesn't charge anywhere near $100/hour labour we will se what the damage is tomorrow.
518314,irishfield,2010-11-08 01:58:00,26272,"There's a shop that doesn't? Ford.. $89.95/hr..  ""budget"" garage down the street from me is now $93.95/hr.. time for me to look at my airplane rate at $55/hr.. can't pull over to the side of the road when your prop departs.. like you can with a wheel!"
518316,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-08 02:02:00,1107,yeah Irish the dealers around here are still around $90 and my buddy charges me $65 I think his regular rate is $75
518318,Dave Bailey,2010-11-08 02:21:00,1641, There's a very good explanation as to why they act that way - they're STUPID!
518435,DanD,2010-11-08 18:59:00,2223,"If it sound like tire noise and it changes while you’re turning one way; I'd say it’s likely a wheel bearing beginning to fail. Control arm bushings when failed much worse then the one pictured will make a clunking noise more so then a rhythmic noise that a tire would. Yes if they (bushings) were like this at the time of the safety inspection then no, they would not have passed; but it’s been a year? On some Escapes (if not all) the bushing are still not available on its own; you may end up buying a control arm assembly to get it.  Dan."
518438,Oktravis,2010-11-08 19:25:00,62,"i have seen that on many many different models across all manufactures.those bushings fail all the tine. yours is not that bad and probably is not making any noise unless it is hitting the cross member at the bottom.the noise it makes would be a clunk over bumps.if you have a continuous noise i would be looking at the bearings or tires.those trucks also are bad for the front sway bar links but that would also make a clunk over bumps to replace that bushing ,you need to replace the hole control arm.they don't sell that bushing separately  good luck travis"
518441,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-08 19:42:00,1107,Thanks guys just had my buddy look at it who is a mechanic and he says the same to check the wheel bearing and he is getting me parts cheap thanks guys for the help.
