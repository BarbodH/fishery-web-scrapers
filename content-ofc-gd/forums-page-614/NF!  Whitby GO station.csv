514834,GBW,2010-10-26 02:01:00,8460,"Hey all.  Let me explain this RANT.  I got to the Whitby GO station a bit late this morning so I just backed into the first spot I found (on the 2nd level ramp of the new garage).  When I got out of the car I didn't notice that the passenger side wheels were on the line (due to me running to my train as I did not want to miss my train).  So I get back to the lot after work and walk up to my car to see it's been keyed, BAD!  I don't have anything great but I DO take very good care of my 2006 Subaru.  Needless to say I AM LIVID when I see this.  My driver side door is toast and so is the hood.  This 'person' decided to stick it so had it's down to the metal!  What makes a 'person' think that an action like this is okay?  Did it make them walk an extra 6 steps because of this?  If so, sorry.  How do I go about getting this fixed now and costing me as little to no money?  I have reached out to the DRPS and I'm waiting to hear back there.  I'm going to the ""GO"" office in the morning before I get on the train (Joe if I'm late this is why).  Now, what do I do?  I guess Karma messed this one up after what I did for a homeless guy on Friday so IT OWES ME!  Does anyone here do body work (paint) on cars?  Any TV Host's want to wrap a car with your show info?  I have one for you...  Now what can I do?  I want to make sure this person pays for their actions.  Thanks.  Geoff"
514835,HTHM,2010-10-26 02:07:00,4082,"Make a police report and insurance claim. That is about all you can do. I would recommend a body shop, but it is in Grimsby which is a bit far. I sympathise."
514837,skeeter,2010-10-26 02:10:00,1907,ask the go people if they have camera surveillance in the parking?
514838,GBW,2010-10-26 02:12:00,8460,I will be at the crack of dawn tomorrow.  I see what looks like cameras all over the garage but who knows how many work (if any).
514846,frozen-fire,2010-10-26 02:19:00,542,"Sorry to hear about that Geoff.  As mentioned, contact your insurance and make a claim after reporting it to the police. Chances are, you'll end up paying your deductible."
514908,GBW,2010-10-26 12:44:00,8460,Well I have a case # now with the police and I am waiting to hear back from the GO Safety & Security people.
514958,GBW,2010-10-26 15:28:00,8460,"I have my case #'s now from both DRPS and GO.  Called a body shop that I have seen some great work come out of there and an over the phone estimate is $2,000.00 after taxes but may be more.  My Ins. company isn't going to provide me a loaner/rental car for the week it will be in the shop either!  Can someone please loan me a car for a week?  I'll drive Dave's F0F truck around all week if he'll let me."
515002,GBW,2010-10-26 18:51:00,8460,"Okay, who ever said good customer service was dead is wrong.  I decided to call the dealer where I purchased my car from (Markham Subaru) to see if they could help me out, considering I have been a loyal customer for them.  I told the service manager what happened and they are going to help me out and provide me a loaner/rental car for the week for free.  The part that still irks me is that even if my Ins. company does catch this person and get's money back, I bet I won't get my $500.00 back.  *EDIT* Oh anb Dave, I'll still keep the offer open for me to use the FOF truck if you want..."
518403,GBW,2010-11-08 16:43:00,8460,I got my car back on the weekend and it's as good as new.  My Subaru dealer brought my car over to K C Auto Services in Markham and those guys did a fine job.  They even have a few Lexus' that looked brand new there getting work done.
518443,skeeter,2010-11-08 19:42:00,1907,did the go station cameras catch the dude that did it?
518447,GBW,2010-11-08 20:01:00,8460,"I wish!  and to answer that, nope..."
518449,BillM,2010-11-08 20:07:00,17367,Exactly what insurance is for.  As for the deductible think of it as a very expensive parking lesson.
