517887,Roy,2010-11-06 00:21:00,13728,"Nothing serious here but news of some board members has not been good. BUT, this weekend should be better as I have a few visitors of the OFC variety arriving tonight for the weekend and a couple more for supper tomorrow night. It should be an excellent time. I'm pumped about that. Hope they have a great stay here and that our supper tomorrow night is filled with laughs and stories.  That's all I wanted to say."
517888,John,2010-11-06 00:24:00,2956,Well I am jealous as those OFC'rs are in for a treat. Roy and J's hospitality is second to none!
