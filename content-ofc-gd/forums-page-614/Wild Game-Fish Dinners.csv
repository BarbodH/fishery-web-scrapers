Another friend has gifted me many meals of moose along with various homemade preserves but this past weekend he dropped a real prize on me. One big fat wild turkey, my first taste of wild turkey, spectacular!  I've been feasting on it for three days and today turned the remains into the beginnings of turkey soup.  Just finished straining the stock and deboning the bird while I stirred up a big pot of moose meat spaghetti sauce.  I gotta say it's good to have friends who hunt and fish."
517518,Joey,2010-11-04 22:22:00,9122,"Okay, now that's just plain mean Chris  What time is dinner?"
517520,misfish,2010-11-04 22:24:00,29133,"Wild turkey is better then most think.No gamey taste  like other wild game.Legs are dark meat and the breast ,all though white meat,is very tender and juicey when cooked right.  Ya gotz some good friends close by Chris."
517524,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-04 22:33:00,0,"many of the guys i work with are not only excellent hunters, but excellent wild game chefs.  on long road trips guys frequently bring game from their home freezer and treat the crew to meals.  in the right hands, i've enjoyed all wild game, from birds to moose, bear, and deer.  wild game dinners put on by hunters associations etc. are great as well because you sometimes get a chance to taste some more peculiar critters like armadillo.  you've made me hungry just thinking about all this spiel.  leftovers it is."
517525,irishfield,2010-11-04 22:34:00,26272, Ya want me to pick you up on the way Hun?? It's KD here otherwise tonight...
517543,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-04 23:22:00,2582,Being a non hunter I don't get the chance very often for wild game. My old boss and his wife used to invite us over for dinner and Elanor could make anything taste great. Had some great fish dinners there and her moose stew was to die for.  A few years ago Buckster a fellow OFC'er shared some venison with me from a deer I believe his father got. I turned the choicer cuts into bacon wrapped fillets and made a stew out of the rest. Enjoyed every bite of it all.  Enjoy your friends generosity Chris and thx for sharing.
517571,Leecher,2010-11-05 00:34:00,7832,You are one lucky dude to have such great friends Chris Never had wild turkey before and sounds like it's delicious enough to make soup out of the remains..... Can't go wrong with that!!!  PS If you happen to have any extra..... just mail it to me  Jacques
517581,fishnsled,2010-11-05 01:00:00,3520,"That sounds sooooo good. You should come to Quinte and be our cabin boy....I mean cook. By the sounds of it you are waaaay a head of Brian for wild game this year and your didn't leave the house......I could be wrong:huh:. Sorry Brian, I'll blame it on Wayne's deer joke from earlier."
517646,solopaddler,2010-11-05 11:16:00,8605,"I drove by your place around 9pm last night enroute from fishing.  I should have stopped in, I was so hungry I was going blind. LOL!  I ate a box of crackers when I got home."
518246,Spiel,2010-11-07 22:06:00,9065,"It sure is good to have generous friends.  Still feasting on turkey and moose (and cork dust...*cough*), perhaps for a few more days yet."
518248,spinnerdoc,2010-11-07 22:16:00,556," i sure hope not from my rod chris the only game meats i get are the ones i buy from the butcher.....deer, duck, wild bore, goat to name a few. most of them i either roast or stew em up.....now you got me droolin"
518250,Spiel,2010-11-07 22:19:00,9065,  As a matter of fact is. 
518251,spinnerdoc,2010-11-07 22:21:00,556,you should have included a mask on my list of parts then.
518252,Spiel,2010-11-07 22:25:00,9065,"  I have masks but wearing them causes my glasses to fog up, then I can't see the cork."
518261,spinnerdoc,2010-11-07 22:57:00,556,"i'll have to bring some game meats then to make up for the inconvinience, ha ha.  good eats chris"
518279,aplumma,2010-11-08 00:30:00,6896, I found that Walnut dust adds more flavor than Cork dust does. You also can ummmm use a shop vac to catch the dust before you get suberosis.read it so you will get some dust control you igidit.  suberosis.  Art
