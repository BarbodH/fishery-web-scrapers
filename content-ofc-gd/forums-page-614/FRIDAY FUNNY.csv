A woman and a baby were in the doctor's examining room, waiting for the doctor to come in for the baby's first exam.  The doctor arrived, and examined the baby, checked his weight, and being a little concerned, asked if the baby was breast-fed or bottle-fed.  'Breast-fed,' she replied..  'Well, strip down to your waist,' the doctor ordered.  She did. He pinched her nipples, pressed, kneaded, and rubbed both breasts for a while in a very professional and detailed examination.  Motioning to her to get dressed, the doctor said, 'No wonder this baby is underweight. You don't have any milk.'  I know,' she said, 'I'm his Grandma,  But I'm glad I came."
