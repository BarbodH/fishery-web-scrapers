Mike Harris where are you??  I am glad you think all is well just don`t look at your National debt that very well may be the next bubble down there to burst, the most recent bubble almost crippled your financial system but government stepped into bail them with more borrowed money I might add, just wondering how long it will be before China seeks foreclosure, but don`t worry Billy Bob we will always have a place for our American OFC brudder's"

BTW how's that all working out for you......13% sales tax (ours is 8.74%)...over $4 per gallon on gasoline (purchased gas today at $2.78 per gallon)....everything cost almost 2X as much as it does here in NYS which is one of the heaviest taxed states in America....Boating Card $49.99 for NOTHING (not required here)....Outdoor card $9 (also not required here) which only gets you the right to purchase a hunting/fishing license....License fees keep rising where at one time residents of Ontario were NOT required a fishing license...gun registration per firearm and no handguns allowed (not required here and hand guns permits are attainable).....hunting course that I have read here that cost around $500.00 (here in NYS it's FREE).

First of all, our gallon is bigger than yours.Plus we get alot more bang from our buck than you do.Actually, not true, you get more bang for your buck,looking at how much your Gov spends on the military and defense.I`m in Quebec,so no outdoors card, cost 19.25 for a fishing licence, so thats not bad.Don`t want hand guns, we have enough problems with our neighbors packin heat. If you want to screw your Gov out of its tax dollars, then don`cry when they try harder to screw you out of your money.Thats the problem, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. simple truth is, if you don;t pay your taxes, you are have no right to complain about the taxes you aren`t paying.Its a no brainer man."

Only time will tell, but it would not hurt to write to your respective representatives.  ""Mr. xxxxxxx,  Thank you for your email about the propane regulation and its impact on your business. I apologize for the delay in responding.  Toby Barrett, MPP Haldimand-Norfolk, has been taking the lead on this issue for the Progressive Conservative Caucus. He has been working with the Ontario Propane Association to get urge the government to make changes to this proposal. He has written to the Minister of Consumer Affairs John Gerretson on this issue asking him to adopt the suggestion from the Ontario Propane Association that storage sites under 5,000 gallons be excluded from the new $25,000 requirement.  Mr. Barrett has been told by the Minister's Office that a new proposal should be released mid-November. We will continue to track this issue on your behalf and will send you any new information that we receive from the ministry.  Thank you for taking the time to send your concerns to Sylvia. She appreciates knowing how this regulation will directly impact your business.

I have no problem with improvements but why does it always come with a ridiculous price tag. Don't like living near a propane station...move. You can't protect everyone from everything. It's a gas and it's dangerous. Improve the handling and be done with it. We over complicate everything.

I finally got a response from her office acknowledging my letter, but still have not seen the promised response from Sylvia Jones herself.  This is a TSSA (Technical Standards and Safety Authority) issue. They are hard up for funds and looking to make money to sustain themselves. These are the folks that took over from the old MCCR (Ministry of Commercial and Consumer Relations). Lets face it, TSSA is in public doo doo for letting the Sunrise incident happen in Toronto. If they had been inspecting sites like this and doing their duty, it should not have happened. They were transferring propane in an illegal manner, had been sited for it in the past, but allowed to continue. At least this is how I heard it happened.  They are using this as a stepping stone to save face with the public and also garner some much needed funding from those $25,000 numbers quoted. The services of a qualified engineer are required. Problem is, there are not many engineers knowledgeable in this area of service. Once written, the plan has to be passed by the local fire department. Most rural fire departments are volunteer based and do not have the expertise in this area either. expediary The time frame and cost to the local distributor is what will push this over the top for most of them. It is absolutely ridiculous to punish the little guys and public for something that has nothing to do with them. People that camp and travel from other Provinces and States will boycott Ontario over this. Once again, the little folks pay the price!  I had to load up my utility trailer with the 100# cylinder at our RV trailer and haul it into town for a fill. I'm sure I already got gouged for it this year! Next year, I will expect that dealer will have shut down. There is a Sparlings plant that should survive in Brechin, but they are only open Mon. to Friday. Does not help me much on the week-ends when I can get there.  We used to get delivery right to our trailer every second week-end, but even that has ceased already. Royal pain in the you know what!!!!  I'm sure our MPP's  can apply some pressure if they so choose to get this thing rescinded or turned around. Thing is, they would have to act in a more expedited manner than they are responding to my letter!! I don't get very political very often, but I do have to see both Sylvia Jones (Provincial) and David Tillson (Federal) at our local home and garden shows twice a year. Now I'll have something to ""discuss"" with them! Could be we have a couple of ""pantloads"" here...oh and BTW, both are PC, not Liberal!"

516341,mercman,2010-10-31 14:09:00,7054,"  I have an opininion on buying anything on the indian reservations in my area.Just suffice it to say that they pay no taxes, contribute very little to the coffres of the Canadian Gov.,When i spend my money there, none of it goes back to help pay for all the Gov funded projects that make my life easier.NOT SAYING that the Gov is by any means worthy of distributing my taxes, just dont want to contribute to the problem.And don't forget, this is ONLY MY OPINION and i dont ask anyone else to support it."
516353,Billy Bob,2010-10-31 14:58:00,5865," EXACTLY.......the more the governments get ($$$$$) the more they WASTE......I go out of my way not to pay taxes, either by buying on the Res or using the internet catalogs for merchandise."
516398,mercman,2010-10-31 18:24:00,7054," Internet catalogues are great.Even though YOU aren't paying tax, the seller IS.Plus if he is a shrewd bussiness man, he has hidden an amount in the price representing the tax you would have paid on the sale amount(this assuming that the seller does not live on a reservation somewhere)He knows that your not paying tax, but he is. Now lets caculate quickly.Lets say you buy for 100 per month on the Res.depending on what your buying, lets say 10Percent should got to taxes, to make it easy to caculate.So your looking at $1320 dollars that would have gone to taxes,per year, just on your own purchases.I figure that there is probably a million people at least who do the same thing.So now your looking at $1,320,000.00 per year of taxes that was robbed from me and all the other canadians who pay thier taxes even though they dont like it.This is a vastly underestimated calculation.The real figures are much much higher.PLUS, and this is the MAIN point here.What you SAVED last year, is recuperated in the next budget because the government has to increase taxes to make up for the cheaters out there who DONT LIKE to pay them. Interesting, don,t you think  Wheter its you, or me, the Gov always gets its taxes,so why not share the load and hope the next Gov will be better than this one. BTW i know your american,so just substitute american for canadian in this post."
516424,Billy Bob,2010-10-31 21:00:00,5865,"Sorry, As I said the more the government gets the more the government waste...study YEARS ago that the federal government spent $1.31 for every dollar collected in taxes.....I'm doing you a favor...  Also the seller here does NOT pay the tax on internet sales.....I would ONLY if the seller has some presents in NYS, if not NO TAXES for either of us on the sale.....SWEET ! ! !  Happy Shopping, Bob"
516442,mercman,2010-10-31 21:55:00,7054," Seller paid taxes when he either manufactured the product or purchased it for resale.Thats where His part of the taxes are.He paid the tax, so he sure as heck ain't gonna lose that money.He will either deduct it from what he owes the tax man or hide it in the price No ifs ands or butts.If he is legit, he pays tax. no way around it.The Gov gets thier cut from him, but not from the purchaser.At least not directly,they collect your part from him.Unless he is native american, then no one profits but the native american.And if he charges tax to you,which he probably does somewhere, he keeps that too."
516537,John Bacon,2010-11-01 04:12:00,3277," If you are referring to sales taxes, the retailer generally wouldn't have to pay tax on goods purchased for resale.  Depending on the tax juristiction they either wouldn't pay tax on the goods to begin with (Ontario PST for example); or in some cases they would pay the tax up front but deduct it from future tax payments (GST and HST for example).  In either case the retailer would have effectively not paid tax on the goods that he ships to you.  A mail order retailler may not be responsible for collecting sales taxes on goods that he ships to you.  If you ordered from a retailer in your state/provice you would most likely have to pay the local taxes.  If you ordered from outside your state/province they may not be required to charge you the taxes.  So yes, it is possible to make a legit mail order purchase without paying taxes.  p.s. you may have slipped a decimal place on your previous post.  I don't see how 10% of $100/month = $1,320/per year."

516886,mercman,2010-11-02 17:25:00,7054," I tried really hard, but here is what i was eluding to the other day. http://webidiotz.com/_blog/Blog/post/PST_GST_What_do_you_need_to_know!/  'Note that if you, the vendor, do not charge and collect RST, the responsibility falls onto the purchaser:  “If taxable goods and services are purchased for own use from an out-of-province vendor or supplier who does not charge and collect RST, the purchaser is required to report and pay the applicable RST on the total fair value”  Don't get me wrong here, i had suspected, but wasn't sure about this myself.So, you SHOULD be paying your local sales tax on anything purchased, no mater where it comes from. Whether you want to be part of the problem or part of the solution, is your bussiness. And thats just my opinion of course."

515352,Handlebarz,2010-10-27 23:57:00,3790,"I just read this from a local site here in the Chatham area it sure does not sound good for back yard BBQ's or heating your campers  .....want to read this!:(:mad:  ""Hold onto your wallets 'cause Dalton and his gang are at it again!""  Ontario Propane Legislation  Another Government Blunder!!  Well, in the Ontario governments latest brainstorming session they have now set their sights on the supply of propane and making it almost impossible for the average consumer or business to purchase it. In a release that I just received from the Ontario Propane Association, the Ontario Recreational Vehicle Dealers Association and Camping in Ontario the latest bill Ontario Regulation 440/08 due to come into effect January 01 2011 will see the many distribution centres that dot the Province require the services of a Professional Engineer to the tune of $25,000 per site to develop what they term a Risk and Safety Management Plan. This plan would take up to three months to prepare, again, by site. What this will mean to the average consumer is that we will no longer be able to get our BBQ or RV tanks filled at the local refueling station as many can not afford these initial and ongoing costs. The larger centres where propane might still be available will see prices escalate, some even speculating above $50 per 20lb tank just to fill making camping, one of the best past times, that much more expensive, possibly forcing some to stop camping. A lot of families and retirees alike are on strict budgets. If Ontario Regulation 440/08 is implemented as written, it is surmised that 90% of Ontario's propane refill installations will close. We, as a company, normally supply our new trailers with full propane tanks but will no longer have access to an economical supply as well as the average consumer will be out in the cold, literally. So what can be done??  Please contact your local MPP and let them know that this regulation HAS to be modified so that we consumers and business's alike have access to an economical supply of propane. We all understand that Safety is of the utmost importance when it comes to any fuel.

515385,skeeter,2010-10-28 00:49:00,1907,"Thanks for the heads up. but couldnt you have posted this before everyone closed up the trailer for the winter--LOL damn, i hope i can get the 100LB tanks filled in may. and i hope i can afford it"
515388,fishing n autograph,2010-10-28 00:53:00,2540,costco........$10 cheaper than anywhere else
515404,nofish4me,2010-10-28 01:23:00,404,TSSA has nothing to do with Dalton. Would you like to see another propane site like TO had? All they are doing is trying to stop a repeat occurrance.
515407,Pigeontroller,2010-10-28 01:26:00,2793,Charcoal!
515440,Bernie,2010-10-28 02:21:00,3190,We sell propane at our shop. We are in a small town and we do it as much for a community service as anything else. Also many of our customers have cottages and it's handy for them to stop here and get their tanks filled. This legislation will be the end of this service in our town. I will be as sorry as anyone to see it go as I use a lot of propane myself. I really didn't like Dalton McGuinty before this and I like him a lot less now.
515444,BUSTER,2010-10-28 02:30:00,1336,
515449,nofish4me,2010-10-28 02:35:00,404," I would really like someone to please explain to me what Dalton McGuinty has to do with this. This is a simple request, because I really don't know. Do you?"
515465,fishermccann,2010-10-28 03:02:00,655,"They just want to blame the guy in power for everything , if it  is not his fault then it will be the next guy. Would you want a propane  filling station next door to you? I thought not. Remember Sunrise, I bet that was his fault too!"
515491,bigugli,2010-10-28 07:44:00,6138,"There have been 2 serious propane blasts and fires this past year at propane depots in Southern Ontario. Obviously something is seriously amiss and needs to be addressed. Obviously self-policing, within the industry, is not working, DUHHHHHH"
515495,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-28 09:46:00,2582,  And there folks I believe is the correct answer.
515502,outllaw,2010-10-28 11:15:00,1232,"this is sadly just another pork barreling option from our leaders. campaign funds and suddenly new legislation abounds. as there were a couple incidents that were highlighted, now this.as a society we are pushing to remove the HAVESand create the have-nots. unfortunatly the goverment see,s fit to further reduce the middfle class thru taxations, program .reductions. well folks remember at the polls. call your mpp."
515503,Bernie,2010-10-28 11:19:00,3190, The legislation has to be made up and passed through the house. Dalton doesn't need to pass it through as it is written....does he?
515509,Muskieman,2010-10-28 11:30:00,2472,"Man, I hope this doesn't pass.  I use 200+ Lbs just while BBQing in the summer and about another 100 during the winter. And 120+ Lbs/season in the Camper.  Gonna be    on the Beer budget!!  I'll have to resort to Minute Steak vs T-Bones and a bag of chips vs baked potatoes.  They might be safety conscious but being safe doesn't mean that it has to cost more $.  Randy "
515510,corvette1,2010-10-28 11:50:00,1765,if you are close come across the border 8.00 bucks for a 20lb  
515513,dave524,2010-10-28 12:04:00,4508,"Where I worked we had propane towmotors, heavy rubber gloves, face shields, grounding straps etc., go to some filling stations for the BBQ and a 16 year old girl is filling with bare hands in jeans and a T shirt"
515517,skeeter,2010-10-28 12:10:00,1907,DAMN IF YOU SAID SHE WAS 20 I WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THE ADDRESS !!!!!!!!! 
515520,Fish4Eyes,2010-10-28 12:26:00,1022,"Thank goodness my Weber bbq is natural gas . Although, it is going to suck big time for camping thats for sure."
515659,Handlebarz,2010-10-28 19:39:00,3790,The problem I have with it is that the mom and pop shops that have been filling BBQ tanks for years will be out of business like Bass Haven here in Mitchell's bay they just took there tank out and from what Dennis said on his site they had been filling tanks for 40 years with no problems. I agree with the big supply stations needing to be away from residential areas but I would not be afraid to have a BBQ tank filling station next door to me.
515664,Cookslav,2010-10-28 19:56:00,1457,"Propane has been getting filled into tanks safely the old way for a VERY long time.... Heck is a filling station any more dangerous then my 10year old BBQ? Geeze....  The chances of an ""incident"" are 10x more likely to happen at a poorly maintained residental appliance then a proffessional business Give yer heads a shake.... A couple of recent incidents might warrant some public awareness and education but to turn the operation upside down is ridiculous. If they want to impose some new manditory rules, and saftey checks I think its great. But not for the ridiculous costs presented. Its yet another Fiberal money grab gaurenteed....just like the all the tax increases he promised not to do.  Its not rocket science here folks.... Impose the rules, and make the distributor liable in their license to sell...end of story. That should not cost $25K  This is just another attempt to bank roll some cash and look good in the public eye with ""safety concerns"" But nice try.... I guess the Fib's gotta find some way to cover their tracks...can't wait to hear the Financial mess we're in come election time."
515737,ch312,2010-10-28 23:39:00,1590," mcsquinty, mcguilty, and the list goes on...  WAKE UP AND SMELL THE DAMN COFFEE PEOPLE!!!  vote for anyone besides the LIEberals   like previously mentioned, we have been using the same method to fill tanks for eons. something bad happens in craphole toronto and now the rest of us are gonna have to pay for it.  current propane tank filling methods are safe or we would have waaaay more accidents. i'd bet my bottom dollar that its stupid people causing these accidents and its not the actual procedure itself. like usual, idiots ruin it for everyone else.  just another case of the guvment trying to protect us from ourselves."
515741,BUSTER,2010-10-28 23:48:00,1336,NOT LOCKED YET?
515742,ch312,2010-10-28 23:49:00,1590," it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out mcdoofus is bad news, yet people STILL think he is somehow helping us???  :wallbash:"
515747,HTHM,2010-10-29 00:05:00,4082,"I just wish that I could change the ""hot topic"" flame to an explosion icon....be most appropro for this topic. I agaree that is something that needs a sober second look, and not a, (by our perception), knee jerk reaction."
