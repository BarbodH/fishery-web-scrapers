517725,stubbex1,2010-11-05 15:45:00,164,"Just looked at the pics on the facebook page.  Those perch would be fun to catch on an ultralight on lake erie!!!!   Some other cool prehistoric looking fish too.  Inkman, any dealers coming on board in southwestern Ontario? Woodstock, London?"
517727,Inkman,2010-11-05 15:52:00,19,"Hopfully, need to get the word out through anglers who have interest in the product. Most shops seem very reluctant, can't quite understand why, but if enough people ask their local tackle shops to ""check us out"" I'm cetain that will change. Thanks for your input!"
517740,big bass 444,2010-11-05 16:42:00,2,I have the privilege to work with Loic and all the guys at Fishingstuff and it`s just lot`s of fun!!!...a great family with a great product. I am mainly using the bass rods (Flip`N`Pitch) (Bass pro series) and the (Soft bait elite). I sometime get feedbacks about the 2 piece issues with the bass rods but I believe that this is priorly a mather of taste. All Fishingstuff bass rods exceed all standards not only with the warranty they offer but also with the specific applications each one of them where design for.  I invite you to try them if you have the chance!  Yan.
518194,FISHINGSTUFFF,2010-11-07 14:49:00,11,any questions ?
518217,mercman,2010-11-07 18:12:00,7054,"  For those of us who dont have a retailer nearby where we can see them and price them, what are they comparable to in action, feel and PRICE. Can we order them directly from you on line or by phone.They SEEM to be well designed and manufactured from what i've seen on your website.Also, are they available to suit various budgets or are they all HIGH end."
518268,FISHINGSTUFFF,2010-11-07 23:46:00,11,"hello  since 2006 all our rods are between 79$ and 149 $ and regarding blank you can compare them with all famous brands. A new model in carbon composite will be added at 49 $ for 2011. Unfortunately we have only one dealer currently in Ontario, we are looking for others ones soon.  We don't sale rods directly...but you can buy it through this sole(at this time) dealer ...please see our website"
518322,FISHINGSTUFFF,2010-11-08 02:44:00,11,"Mercman i just see you're living in Brossard, Qc...you can visit our site to find the nearest retailer..."
518323,mercman,2010-11-08 02:55:00,7054," thanks, i'm going to try Bud in St Jean.Its only 20 minutes from me. Merci, probablement semaine prochaine. Faut preparer mon liste pour noel"
518331,FISHINGSTUFFF,2010-11-08 03:44:00,11,"thanks, Stephane (Bud) is a good guy ...if he don't have the rod you want you can place order and have a delivery 24-48h later"
518332,Roy,2010-11-08 03:44:00,13728,My closest one is Pronature Sorel-Tracy. I'll be out there to have a look soon. I caught 4 lakers one morning last spring with your rods fishing with Marc Thorpe. Good stuff.
518388,FISHINGSTUFFF,2010-11-08 15:26:00,11,"i know that Roy, thanks for your comment"
518496,Marc Thorpe,2010-11-08 22:42:00,621,"  You did ?????  Wheres was I   all kidding aside,Loic is a friend of a long time friends Mike Seguin and Mark Kruppa (Bjorn Magnusson). All this came together and its funny how 18 years go by and the stories of yesteryear are shared once again.  Hopefully together we can lend a helping hand to Loic and possibly give the product a try I figured OFC would be a good place to introduce the product to the rest of Canada. As Roy mentioned the 8ft trout rod I most enjoyed for lakers ,specks,browns and rainbows and used the 6 footers for trolling walleyes. The walleye Jig Master is one to consider  Something else to consider  be well marc"
518512,Handlebarz,2010-11-09 00:08:00,3790,nice looking rods will you have some at the big Ontario fishing shows?
518533,FISHINGSTUFFF,2010-11-09 01:46:00,11,We are looking for that...

516999,AzuluSpookd,2010-11-02 23:44:00,348,"Good stuff! Ill check it out for sure, if Thorpe is involved, they'll definitely be good stuff."
517003,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-03 00:02:00,1107,they look nice but I hate 2 peice rods and most are 2 if they start making more 1 peice I will try one out for sure.
517006,solopaddler,2010-11-03 00:08:00,8605,I'd need to know who's making the blanks for them before I'd consider one.  (would be nice if they weren't red too   )
517128,bdox,2010-11-03 14:33:00,329,"Wow, could they have ripped off the Loomis skeleton fish logo any more?"
517135,Roy,2010-11-03 15:13:00,13728,Thank you for your support.
517176,adempsey,2010-11-03 18:06:00,1498,They look pretty nice to me.  Hopefully they are at one of the sports shows next year so I can touch one.
517190,darsky,2010-11-03 19:00:00,586,I fished with their rods in the spring and the trout/laker rod is a great piece to use. Roy-are there any discounts for members?
517203,aplumma,2010-11-03 19:43:00,6896,Nice lookin rods their Gentleman. I am sure with the guidance of Mark and Marc they are well thought out and should fit the bill for any fishing situation. When Lak Air gets a little closer I will place an order and have them sent to Roy's for delivery when I am next in Canada.    Art
517207,cwpowell,2010-11-03 19:56:00,265,A sponsor from Quebec sponsoring the Ontario fishing site? How are they sponsoring? Are they contributing money to keep the site up in running so that they can advertise? Are they offering a discount? Can we purchase their product anywhere here?
517218,misfish,2010-11-03 20:47:00,29133,   Whats yer beef ?????  Nothing but trash talk from you about the new sponsor.  They pay to advertise. Dont tell me yer a Canadians hater.
517223,mercman,2010-11-03 20:56:00,7054,"glad you stepped in Brian.Sponsors are hard to find. They have 2 retailers in Ontraio, and are looking for others i bet.From what i read on the site, they are very innovative and competitive in price.Seeing as they use independant retailers, i wouldn't hold my breath for a discount.I wouldn't even ask for one just because i was a member of this board.The price i was quoted was excellent already.  Paul  "
517232,Terry,2010-11-03 21:37:00,14456,"we have a very large number of people on this website, you have to expect there would be a few that would complain and a couple more that have their own agenda.......  but I am sure putting a ad on this site will be profitable for their company"
517237,cwpowell,2010-11-03 21:46:00,265,I  have no beef I am just wondering. Like what do they consider a sponsorship? Thats all.
517241,Roy,2010-11-03 21:58:00,13728, A sponsor is an entity who pays to help keep our bills paid so that we can continue enjoying this community. I hope that answers your question.
517244,misfish,2010-11-03 22:08:00,29133, TY
517309,cwpowell,2010-11-04 02:09:00,265,"Sweet, are there any reps on the board?"
517314,perchslayer666,2010-11-04 02:40:00,280,These rods look sweet! Kinda have a European feel to the rods themselves. I'd like to check one out  cool sponsor

517532,cwpowell,2010-11-04 23:00:00,265,"Outback sports does not carry Fishinstuff products, they are listed as a retailer on Fishingstuff's website."
517557,Beans,2010-11-05 00:03:00,3339,On a species specific site I visit they have made the regional forums for paying members only ...($30 Cnd per year to join & receive a magazine)...and they also have paying sponsors...  I wonder how our members would feel if we went that route ?  I know...I know...bite your tongue Beans...
517595,Gerritt,2010-11-05 01:48:00,6129,"Welcome to our new Sponsor!! thank you for spending you're hard earned advertising dollars with OFC! It helps keep the site operating, and pays for the bills.. Yes website hosting costs real dollars...unlike what many here think...  Nothing in life is a free ride...  Let support and embrace our sponsors.. as they are the ones that allow you the end user, to have a FREE experience here on OFC.  And well I am sure you would not like the alternative.... not that it would happen.....??? ;(  If you like what our sponsors are selling buy if not... well just shush... they are after all paying for you're free ride...    my 0.02cents worth,  G"
517598,irishfield,2010-11-05 02:03:00,26272,"Thanks G!  And Norm.. I have no issues paying for the entertainment here. I voluntarily pay about $150 US a year to belong to an aircraft forum with similar traffic as here. Other forums.. I've pitched in as well to help keep going.. and have no issues doing so here either, but Roy won't take my money!!"
