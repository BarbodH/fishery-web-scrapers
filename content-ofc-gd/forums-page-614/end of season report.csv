517917,kickingfrog,2010-11-06 01:23:00,8333,That's quite the mixed bag.
517920,mercman,2010-11-06 01:30:00,7054,sweet !!! what the heck is that ugly thing.Kinda looks like a goby of sorts.
517925,walleye_man,2010-11-06 01:39:00,135, That is a scalpin my first and only saltwater fish really turned me off from ocean fishing after that haha
517944,skeeter,2010-11-06 02:57:00,1907,"nice report ... but why when you guy's hold up the little ones, theres no smiles?"
517964,Rod Caster,2010-11-06 05:06:00,5784,Good season indeed. Nothing wrong with a few kitties man...they fight and taste good. That musky is a b-youttie.
517969,Stern Rules,2010-11-06 07:07:00,342,We caught a few of those sculpin when we were out on the Bay Of Fundy a couple years ago. I think I had a flounder but I lost it before I got it to the boat. I take it you never got any flounder?
517985,Rod Caster,2010-11-06 12:44:00,5784,Sculpin are in freshwater too. We caught quite a few of them when we were smelt fishing. They will swim up the creeks in the spring to feed on the smelt eggs. They look nearly identical to the ones in your photo.  
517989,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-06 13:03:00,1622,"Great Report very nice variety, congrats on the Musky & I wouldn't be putting the Pike down as Junk fish myself, but to each their own Richard"
517995,rufus,2010-11-06 13:39:00,267, I noticed that the biggest smile was with the biggest Walleye  Looks like you had a great year. Fishing is like a fine wine - it gets better with age so keep on fishin' !
518056,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-06 20:04:00,0,Looks like a very productive season. You guys in Ottawa have some great fishing over there! Thanks for sharing.
518062,BiggFish,2010-11-06 20:33:00,40,Looks like you had a good season. Quite a mix.  Keep it up.  Chad  
518267,jaydub,2010-11-07 23:44:00,145,That's quite the mix of species for one season.  Congrates on a great year!!
