518420,Afraz,2010-11-08 17:48:00,250,"Yeah i doubt catfish were biting, they just inhale any bait they find SLURP. You're lucky to get a lip hookset, usually they will gut hook themselves if they could."

518453,fisher12,2010-11-08 20:14:00,81,"I'm pretty sure it was catfish because some people beside me were only catching catfish and using the same bait as me , worms."
