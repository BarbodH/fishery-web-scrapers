518550,mercman,2010-11-09 03:18:00,7054,I did promise myself to try icefishing this winter.I used to as a kid with Pops.The only real memory i have was watching him run across the lake with the soles of his boots on fire.He dozed off with his feet propped up against our wood heater.Funniest thing i've ever seen.Also the first time i heard the F word coming from his mouth.Left black rubber goo for 1/2 mile in the ice  I never let him forget that either.
518553,GBW,2010-11-09 03:59:00,8460,if that's the case you DO need to get out on the ice again.  just make sure you have a float suit on to be safe.
518288,mercman,2010-11-08 00:57:00,7054,"Its dark again at 5 frigin 30.  I've been doing this for 55 years and it still gets to me.I'm not one of the many people who suffer from S.A.D.(seasonal affective disorder) but i still get moody and lethargic.Get up....its dark.Go to work all day, finish at 5.......ITS DARK AGAIN !!AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH At least this winter i have WFN and you guys, cause i may have gone a little snakey. How do you all cope with this dark crap.  "

I'm fortunate to finish work at 230 pm so at least I see some daylight  But regardless, no matter how cold, getting outside helps. No cure like fresh air! Have a good winter"

518320,splashhopper,2010-11-08 02:36:00,2931,"I suffer from SAD as well.  Last year two people I know suggested to me to start taking 2000-4000 units of Vitamin D per day.  I couldn't believe the difference it made !  All my life I have struggled with this.  I started taking vitamin D for this season 3 weeks ago at the 2000 level and bi-weekly move it up till I get to 4000 units per day.  My doctor is ok with it, and my family is dam glad I am doing it again this year too"
