517263,hunterjoe84,2010-11-03 23:33:00,52,I was just wondering if anyone has tried these socks?  http://www.gean-edwards.com/socks/black_mountain.html  I have tried many things and nothing seems to work for me.  I have baffins rated to -100 and my feet still get cold.  I always carry extra socks and use a polyethylene liner socks and they still get cold.  Anyone have any suggestions?

517359,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-04 12:55:00,0,last year TJ posted the bass pro lifetime guarantee sock.  it's become my go-to socks for inside my waders and my winter boots for snowmobiling/ice fishing.

517368,dks,2010-11-04 13:22:00,36,"Ditto on the Bass Pro Lifetime socks! I originally purchased 3 pairs and now have 7 pairs. I've replaced 3 pairs in 4 years. I not only wear them ice fishing, but, I wear them pretty well all year long. By far the most comfortable socks I've ever had. I used to wear poly liners and socks when ice fishing, but, now I usually just wear the Bass Pro socks by themselves. Once you start wearing them you will find it very difficult to wear any other sock."
517369,Governator,2010-11-04 13:23:00,879,I saw Battery Heated socks last night at CT:  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/Powersports/ComfortConvenience/PRD~0894688P/Nordic%252BBattery%252BHeated%252BSocks.jsp?locale=en
517389,ehg,2010-11-04 14:10:00,2666, Ditto on the Bass Pro lifetime guarentee socks. Any cold weather and these socks go on. Have a few pairs for a few years and they are like new still.
517392,SBCregal,2010-11-04 14:36:00,688,"the basspro ones are fantastic... i bought 3 pairs as well, went back and bought another half dozen.  wear them in my workboots every day.  got a pair on right now even.  well worth it.   ryan"
517594,super dave,2010-11-05 01:47:00,323,I also recommend the BPS socks.  I use a poly liner and I'm comfy all day standing in cold water.  Like you I used to get cold feet easily.
517627,Kinger,2010-11-05 05:17:00,351,"Thanks, I'm gonna pick up a few pair of BPS socks!"
517639,hunterjoe84,2010-11-05 10:36:00,52,Thanks everyone for your input.  I will be getting a few pairs of the bass pro socks!!  I hope thse work for me.

517870,misfish,2010-11-05 22:48:00,29133,"If your moving about,theres no soak that beats another.If your sitting in a stand for hours,I dont care if it,s a power sock from hell.Your feet get cold.I sat for 7 hours each day this week.The first 3 are ok,but after that,well it,s time to do the two step in the boots."
517889,Fisherman,2010-11-06 00:26:00,7201,"In addition to what Brian said, and, maybe it's time to go see the Doc and find out if you have poor circulation, possible sign of diabetes and maybe some other ailments."
517896,misfish,2010-11-06 00:33:00,29133," For as long as I have iced fish and hunted,my feet always got cold. I have been checked over many times for diabetes as it does run in the family. Fit as a fiddle."
517958,hunterjoe84,2010-11-06 04:29:00,52,I was tested for that and full bloodwork 6 months ago because I thought the same but no.  Very healthy.
518356,Uncle Buck,2010-11-08 13:22:00,1000,"buy your boots a few sizes bigger so you can wiggle your toes...  wiggling them will circulate the blood in them and help keep them warm...  when ice fishing get a 2"" thick piece of styrafoam and put your feet on it... that'll also help...  i use the bass pro lifetime socks and never had any issues...  also have boots similar to this one and love them... the insulation is only in the bottom part of the boot, (remainder is under float suit) plus it's rubber/waterproof all the way up... mine are only 1200g of thinsulate... mine have a better tread, but these ones have more insulation  http://www.basspro.com/RedHead-16-2000-Gram-Insulated-Waterproof-Rubber-Boots-for-Men/product/10202000/-1606230"
