518105,Cudz,2010-11-07 00:37:00,2652,"I got out on Kbay with my daughter for 2.5 hours this aft. I had 4 fish in the first hour and cuaght only 1 after that.  One fish was 5.15 and the other was 4.65.  All the other fish I caught were in the 2-3 pound range.Check out teh dirty little pencil stache I have got going on as well.  fun afternoon and great weather.  It was glass out there. Yeah, I am not sure why I distorted the pic.  I guess I wanted the sky to look like DQ ice cream.  5.15 pounds. "

518124,BUSTER,2010-11-07 01:19:00,1336,How the heck do you get away with wearing a white sweater fishing???????????/
518128,Jigger,2010-11-07 01:22:00,1237,^^^The stache should answer that question.    Nice one man. Wish I could've joined. Looked like a great day to be on the water.
518135,ld17,2010-11-07 01:51:00,319,"great catch there, congratulations.  How deep were you fishing and what was the water temp.  Thanks"
518137,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-07 02:01:00,1622,"Nice look'n Smallies, hoping to get out Tomorrow Richard"
518140,Cudz,2010-11-07 02:09:00,2652,22-35' I dodn't try deeper today.  no clue about water temp.  Somewhere between cool and fairly cold.
518149,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-07 02:49:00,1107,Nice I always pack up the bass gear way to soon.
518161,Moosebunk,2010-11-07 07:11:00,3970,Dood!!!  I fished that spot in pic 1.  Curly Trees Lake down around Swirlville!!  lol.  Nice bass.
518170,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-07 12:35:00,0,Nice bass but I would imagine they don't fight as hard when its this cold?
518171,Cudz,2010-11-07 12:56:00,2652,unfortunately you are 100% correct.  I can never tell whether it is a 5 pounder or a 2 pounder.  Fight lasts only seconds.  That is the only downside of late fall bass fishing.  You get one quick run from them and maybe one jump.  I am not sure if it the cold or the fact that they are just really fat and big.  Even in the summer I find it easier to land a 5 that a 3-3.5.  In the summer the smaler fish are out of the water 5 or 6 times by the time they get to the boat.  They are younger and more athletic.
518173,Cudz,2010-11-07 12:59:00,2652,You are confused. This pic was taken near Spinsville and the lake is called Curveyshore.  But hey are similar.  Just depends on what you are drinking.
518203,cwpowell,2010-11-07 16:06:00,265,Nice fish dude. Stache is nasty! Suits you!
