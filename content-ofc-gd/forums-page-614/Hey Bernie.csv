517836,Tybo,2010-11-05 20:45:00,1373,"Go to the bone yard and get one.You may have cracked it,but looks like the seal is leaking. I know quite a few people that have hit them,myself twice and every time they were cracked."
517837,misfish,2010-11-05 20:55:00,29133,"No crack Paul. I looked myself.It,s coming right from the seal.Must of bunked it right on the bolt and jammed it up.I did phone the boneyard, but there seems to be a lack of ford parts.Something about ""built tough"",if you dont abuse them.  This maybe my last fixs for the ole girl.I just cant bring myself to having payments for a new one.Buying used is just crazy.They want just as much almost."
517842,Tybo,2010-11-05 21:11:00,1373,Oh yeah. It's a Ford. Couldn't get going fast enough to hit it that hard. I grazed a rock.

517905,vinnimon,2010-11-06 00:55:00,2593,"  your better off getting a reman steering box from a supplier. Barton auto supply and hamilton auto supply have decent prices! Ive changed plenty of them, esp fords! And theres possibly more damage done to it than just a seal! Esp if your alignments out of whack!"
518021,misfish,2010-11-06 17:02:00,29133,Alignment is fine. No pulling to either side.  Thanks vinnimon.
