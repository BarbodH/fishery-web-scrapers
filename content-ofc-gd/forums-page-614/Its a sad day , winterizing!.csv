518383,Grimace,2010-11-08 15:10:00,2020,"Another month for me.  I have not got a chance to get out in it the last while between work and the little one.  Hopefully one or two trips in December then she will go away.  Wasn't too long ago, a few years back when lakers and whitefish opener on simcoe was soft water and plus 5 and people were trolling Quinte until mid January. My boat was in storage.  That will never happen to me again."
