17190,Rich,2006-12-30 05:10:00,3927,"Well I have to say I had a great time meeting a ton of OFC'ers, now with my memory I probably wont recognize half the people next time I see them, lol  But anyways it was great meeting all of you and sharing some conversation and laughs.  Now without further delay, here is the pictorial tour of the night.  First off Easy Josh and I went to Nautifish's house as she was our taxi ERR ride for the night. When we got there she informed us that she was in the shower. I was courteous enough to offer her some company but she turned that down.  Josh made nice with some guy in a red outfit at her place though.    Soon enough we were on the road, picked up Sleded and he and Josh sat in the backseat. God only knows what they were doing back there but I did get a little peak.    With no delays we made it to the fire hall and laid right into the towering inferno sandwich! What a meal fit for a filthwich boy.      We got to meet Carp who insisted that he help me do the patented BBR WGSF hold, even though there were no WGSF around.    Random shots..            Then DouG had to get in on the action    Here is Fish Farmer, Tracker and I'm sorry but I forget the other gentleman's name, oh and me doing another trademark pose    Finally got to meet Roger (BPS Bassman) which was awesome, great guy! I had to get him in a BBR pose as well.. at first he was kinda shy    But then he warmed up..    Now board admins, don't fire Spiel as a mod for this, but he was spotted with the evil-doer BBR!    Wait admins, you cant fire him.. seems one of the admins was hangin' with me too! Great to meet you Rick!    Now here's a pack you dont want to run into in a dark alley..    Fishergirl, Joey, Nautifish and Spiel    And finally, I had a good chat with Aaron Shirley which was great.. couldnt get him to make a BBR pose though.. maybe next time!    Oh yeah.. drinking beer through your nose is not recommended.    Had a great time everybody, thanks again!"

17577,Fish Farmer,2006-12-31 13:50:00,2234,"Nice meeting you Rich, You should have had your cam-corder. The OFC Swill would have be a good feature film, At least a good commercial in your Action Angling fishing films. Know wonder you guys past out going home. You and yours buds burned your self out with all those Action Shots. Have a good New Year. See you in your next episode."
