16551,tapout,2006-12-28 05:14:00,166,"Hey everyone.  well I have had a bit of time on my hands.  Sorry I wasn't a whizz in english class back in high school.  hope I don't bore anyone.  'Twas the Night before Opener'   Twas the night before opener, when all through the land Not a 'fish' was swimming, not even a 'salmon'. The rods were placed by the 'lowerunit' with care, In hopes that St 'nick' soon would bring beer.  The 'tip-up' was nestled,  in the 'bigun' 'taklebox', While 'lew' dreamed of 'muskiesnlakers' swimming under the docks. And 'joey' in her nighty, and 'tybo' puffin' the pipe, We won't mention what they did on this long winterâ€™s night.  When out in the night, someone did yell, And startled 'roy'awake, and out of the bed he sure fell. He stumbled to the window, half asleep and half drunk, And heard 'misfish' say, that his 'fishfinder' was junk.  The roads were filling with nearly 2 ft of snow, As 'Roy' the 'Fisher' wondered if fishing they would be able to go. When, what to his wondering eyes should appear, But St.'nick' in a 'bigchev4x4' with the back full of beer.  A little old driver, his hair all frizzy, was honking for 'roy', who was now feeling dizzy. ""Hurry Hurry"" the OFC gang has came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!  ""Now 'big cliff'! now, 'irishfield'! now, 'graftongal' and 'taper', On, 'T.J'! On, 'spiel'! on, 'pigeonfisher' and 'caper'! In the back! Grab on! don't forget to 'holdfast' Someone get 'roy', we need be 'haulinbass'.  The tires spun, making the snow fly, When they meet with an obstacle, slid 'round in a slide. Up to the stop sign, around the corner they went, with a truck full of ofncers with beers to be drunk.  So once the opener gets here, be sure to post, Of all the ones that got away, and of who caught the most, Of walleyes,and whitefish, and perch and 'laketrout', You'll have a great time,once you can get out.  Merry Christmas all and have a safe holidays.   Cheers,  Tony."

16622,lew,2006-12-28 16:10:00,12767," Thanks tapout, that's some funny stuff, but I think ""muskiesnlakers"" may get the wrong idea if he reads that I'm dreaming of him"
16625,Joey,2006-12-28 16:12:00,9122,Not that there's anything wrong with that

17062,tapout,2006-12-29 19:28:00,166,"hey all,  well glad you liked my ""alternative"" words. lol.  Mike the pike, there wasn't one beer involved in the creation of this master piece.  Refer to the reference to Tybo and you'll get what was involved, hopefully.  lol.  Joey, it took me about 2 or 3 hours to come up with it all together.  A few ""smoke"" breaks here and there and then Voila!......interesting there hasn't been a comment from Roy.  Hmmmmm...wonder if hes put me on the ""people he hates list"" now?...I could be the newest addition.  Tony"
