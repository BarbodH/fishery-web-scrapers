If you just want to recover data, like email....then pending your answers, I, or someone else may be able to steer you in the right direction.  As for sytstem restores, my recolection is that it was only available for Windows ME and XP.  There was a way in 95, but it sucked."

A member, Wendel, who has helped out many here could probably help you with this. PM him. May have to spend a few bucks, but I bet your pc will be back up to snuff quite fast."
