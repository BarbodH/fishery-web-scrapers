16635,Rich,2006-12-28 16:50:00,3927,Gonna try fly fishing for musky next year?

16792,Crazyhook,2006-12-29 01:32:00,1154,"hoodoe is a hoodie that is filled with deer hair for warmth, they are awesome!  BBR... you are onto me!"
16841,Carp,2006-12-29 03:36:00,1488,I have a BPS gift card from Christmas. Didn't even think to check the sales this week. Hope I get a chance to stop by.
17124,Weeds,2006-12-29 23:40:00,782,"I was at Bass Pro yesterday too, also picking up a few Muskie Baits, finally broke down and sprung for a Believer. Looks real sweet. Great store but I could swear the last time I was there  big Lindy M/G spinnerbaits were like 13 bucks and yesterday it was like 22. What gives? I mean, I'm pretty sure it's still somewhere around 11 or 12 bucks at LeBarons. That's just too large a price discrepancy to shrug off. It was the lure that I actually went for more than anything else really. Maybe I misread the pricing but I don't think so. Just goes to show it pays to shop around a bit I guess....Cheers, Weeds"
