16608,fishinfool,2006-12-28 15:22:00,366,This Spring somebody posted a site where you could look at lakes realtime via satellite imaging. Does anyone remember the address of that site? Just wanted to look and see if Balsam has started to freeze or not.  Thanks Stan

16612,fishinfool,2006-12-28 15:32:00,366,Ahhh Yesss. That would be the one! Thanks Terry Just like to keep an eye on the place to make sure the lake doesn't move.

Anyway here is the link just click on the webcam at the top of the page to access the webcam  http://www.reachharbour.com/ Enjoy Kawartha Kev
