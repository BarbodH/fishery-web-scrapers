16727,dheitzner,2006-12-28 23:01:00,314,talked to rob hyatt last night and it's official: he won't have his huts out for our planned stay from Jan 4-7. man this sucks so bad. 
16729,Smokey,2006-12-28 23:05:00,1278,That sucks. Nothing worse then getting your hopes up and having mother nature shoot you down. Better luck with the next one.
16732,Raf,2006-12-28 23:10:00,3495,sorry to hear Darcy.  We're booked for the 19-21st wknd in Callander with a different outfitter.  Keeping fingers crossed.  It may be first ice afterall!
16747,fishdawg,2006-12-28 23:33:00,912,we were booked with another operator too for next weekend - not gonna be enough ice in time for the bungalows - we're gonna head up anywayz hoping there is safe for walking out with  the hand augers & portables
16761,Fisherman,2006-12-29 00:04:00,7201,"Hopefully that weekend should be hard...water. Going with Rob Hyatt, I'm curious if anyone else is bringing along a GMRS radio, just something to pass good info around if the bite starts."
16765,Ron,2006-12-29 00:13:00,1683,"Ya, it's going to be nip and tuck for us as well on Rabbit Lake. They offered for us to use the Ice Bungalo on shore and then use portables. Not liking the idea of that...."

17048,joonmoon,2006-12-29 18:45:00,528,I'm booked with an operator for the first weekend in Feb. Not too worried about ice. Unfortunately I won't be able to get out locally or to Simcoe until we get some really cold nites. Dang as I swear and stare at my portable sitting there in the basement beckoning me to at least sit in it and pretend to ice fish....at least its warm sitting in it where it is now....lol.
