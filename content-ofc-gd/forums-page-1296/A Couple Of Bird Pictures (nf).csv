No catching to report but I've taken some nice scenic pics, here is a couple that I thought I would share. A nice looking hawk.  This one I thought was kind of neat with the moon in the middle of the afternoon   Sorry ice fishers but you really have to love the recent weather for the end of December.  Cheers  Whopper"

17067,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-29 19:43:00,0,Nice pics Phil.  Really like that second one.  Beautiful blue skies.
17069,danc,2006-12-29 19:51:00,4677,Very nice Phil. Is that a Red Tailed Hawk? Love the moon in the second shot!!
17074,Eddyk,2006-12-29 20:06:00,195,Nice pictures. Thanks for sharing them.
17078,wishn4fishn,2006-12-29 20:12:00,108,"sweet, really like the second one.  You should get it blown up and framed.  Although the right side of the pic is a smidge empty with no subject, and the left side is cut off prematurely.  Great shots either way."
