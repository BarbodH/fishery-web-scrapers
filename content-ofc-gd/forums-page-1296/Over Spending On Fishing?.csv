17403,Big Swede,2006-12-30 23:55:00,23,"My $:fish ratio is way outta whack but I am hoping to fix that over time.  Seriously though, good gear and tackle are worth every penny if it does what it should when there's a big fish on the line. Gear failure and unpreparedness will not be tolerated nor should it be!"

16951,nautifish,2006-12-29 14:06:00,1416," Ditto to what fisherman said. Havin three grown boy' of my own i know exactly where you are coming from. I have taught my boy's the same standards. My daughter who is 23 brought a home back in the uk and is getting married next year. My eldest boy who is 21 did cut trees for a living but 18 months ago he had a very serious work accident and was allmost killed. His whole right leg was shattered and had to be rebuilt He now has a metal plate around his ankle and twelve pins in his leg. He was on W.S.I.B FOR A YEAR AND SIX MONTHS AGO HE COULD NOT STAND IT ANYMORE SO HE WENT BACK TO SCHOOL. He did a welding course and three months ago now he landed a job with west lake industries in burlington welding. This boy has had a rough eighteen months and i mean rough. He will never have 100% use of his leg like he used to he will allways have a disability with this leg but it could have been alot worse. He allready has  arthritis setting is which the surgoen said would happen but, he is now in Europe on holiday will be flying back next wednesday then i shall be helping him look to buy a home as thats his goal for 2007 is too own his own home and he is only 21 yrs old.   So you could say this mom is pretty damn proud of him.  He could  be sat at home wallowing in self pity but he is not.  i sopose i was tough on them growing up i sopose i still am.  But one thing i taught my lads & my daughter. Is nothing is for free on this earth you want something you have to go out and earn it that way you will appreciate it alot more."
16962,lookinforwalleye,2006-12-29 14:38:00,4399," LOL! and so true on both statements i have 3 sons still living at home and they are taking full advantage of the situation but i keep warning them retirement for me is not too far off and they should start to think about saving some money so they have some place to go when i do retire, for some reason they had it in their collective heads that when i retire mom and i were just going to move and leave the keys to the house to them. LOL not going to happen boys."
16964,ccmtcanada,2006-12-29 14:42:00,7971,I look at it this way...you need money/credit to overspend....two things I dont really have....LOL.
17000,hawkeye,2006-12-29 16:38:00,162,"When I think about what's now sitting at the bottom of Lake Simcoe yea I over spent. Had wayyyyyyyyyy to much stuff and not enough of what really worked.  Now that I have to rebuild my tackle box from scratch I'm a lot more discriminating. I don't run around to bars, mess around on my wife and she angel that she is lets me buy what I want.  You only go this way once so why not enjoy, and a good women by your side is just icing on the cake, but don't tell her I said that."
17081,urbanangler1990,2006-12-29 20:25:00,933,"Cool guys thnx, ill be looking for a job soon, and making some money so i dont have to borrow anymore, lol, then i can spend all i want and need on fishing stuff!"
17094,Spiel,2006-12-29 21:37:00,9065,"....Over spend, never! Miss spent, occasionally."
17201,Photoz,2006-12-30 09:50:00,792,I went into Lebaron's on Boxing Day for a package of hooks & 2 spools of line . . . . . .      5 minutes later I left with a package of hooks & 2 spools of line . . . . .       ? Already got enough lures to use a different one every 10 minutes for several days . . . . . .   AND STILL CATCH NOODNIK!!
17202,Rizzo,2006-12-30 13:41:00,4754,"no doubt I spend a lot, but more volume than high end stuff (ie a couple of 150 reels instead of 1 three hundred dollar reel).  Its good clean fun, better than wasting it on smoking or gambling!"
