16791,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-29 01:32:00,0,"Well Corey (mistyjr) has compiled some of our highlights of our 2006 fishing season.  Included are two trips to Lakair, our trip to Tennessee, a couple of my outings with some pretty well known OFNr's , ice fishing and several day/weekend trips.     We've added some audio with Green Day's ""Time of your Life"".  I think it is a pretty appropriate song if you listen to the lyrics.    Some of the pictures are a little blurry, but you'll get the jist of it.   Great job Corey   , I hope everyone enjoys....  http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=4541097321236595496"
