17415,Mike the Pike,2006-12-31 00:43:00,3421,  Nautyfish I think all Biteme will be doing News Years Day is this sleeping.  This is a snapshot of Pete at Merlands November 18th 2006.  I Dare you Biteme to get off the couch and get in that water January 1st 2007.  Mike the Pike........
17417,BITEME,2006-12-31 00:47:00,1969,Hey Nautifish NOOOOOOOOOOOO dont grow a beard  I dont think ill be doing it this year but am looking foward to what you will come up with Monday  I started 20 years ago in the arctic for me  Peter  hey mikey ive been there done that  why dont you go in with a TUTU i hear they do it in Montreal Youll fit right in Big cute Guy like you
17430,PERCHER,2006-12-31 00:56:00,787,BITEME was sleeping because reeling in all those walleye over 12lbs is tough work .Especially that 14lber.If I caught that many big fish I would have to slept for a week.
17434,PERCHER,2006-12-31 01:07:00,787,MikethePike in this picture you thought you had a monster walleye .But it was those to crazy guys in the canoe.We watched you fight that for 15 minutes.I am suprised you didnt fall asleep after that battle.I have never hooked into something that weighed about 800lbs before.Anyways you would never catch me in the water in january.
17442,nautifish,2006-12-31 01:24:00,1416,"LOL @ BITEME AND PIKE....  mAN IF I WAS TO GO DOWN TO PD BEACH IN THAT ATTIRE THEY WOULD PROBABLY ARREST ME,,,,LOL  Its is a family event you know .....lol......   Your just gonna have to wait & see."
17449,Mike the Pike,2006-12-31 01:38:00,3421,Imagine I reeled in 800 pounds  op people and canoe.caught 4 nice walleye that day and was able to stay up a little later.Pete had another kind of liquid going threw his gills (hard stuff)thats what finished him off.I am with you Dan I don't want to find out if I have heart problems.Nope I am not taking the plunge.   From what I can see here Pete is not working too hard.You all look relaxed to me.   This is the 800lbs you claim should have tired me out.  OK this was my secret to staying up late that night the first 3 walleyes and the canoe tired me out.  So yes I did take a little snoozy.
17457,BITEME,2006-12-31 02:35:00,1969,"What was 800lbs ""BIG BIRD"""
