16462,Greencoachdog,2006-12-27 20:14:00,8163,Looks good to me! I think Christmas tree tinsel would work pretty good too.

16523,brifishrgy,2006-12-28 01:36:00,559,send some over to TJ he can add them to his tree next year
16524,Smokey,2006-12-28 01:52:00,1278,They look great. Should do well with the lakers as they seem to love the white jigs. Let us know how they work.
16877,camillj,2006-12-29 04:56:00,1988,Exactly what I was thinking Smokey .. when I saw that pearly irridescent glitter .... Lakers (and deep water Specks) came to mind ... if we ever get any ice I'll post a pic or two
