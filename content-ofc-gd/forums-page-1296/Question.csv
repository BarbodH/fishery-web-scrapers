17059,setomonkey,2006-12-29 19:16:00,872,"xrap,  Good question, I know that season openers start at midnight. I would guess that the season ends at 11:59:59 on the closing date, so one second before midnight and your season ends (and the new year begins).  Mike"

17087,setomonkey,2006-12-29 21:06:00,872,Don't forget to toast the new year if you're out...    Mike
17112,Carp,2006-12-29 22:40:00,1488,I would think the 31st is still open for fishing. Closed seasons most likely start Jan 1.  Don't forget to make sure you have a valid licence on Jan 1/07.  Good luck if you get out there.
