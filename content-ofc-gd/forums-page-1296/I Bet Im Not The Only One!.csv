17106,Carp,2006-12-29 22:23:00,1488," Much more than just wings on the menu.  Don't get me wrong. I love hot wings with a few drumsticks mixed in, but it's a year end bash. I may be looking for something different tonight. Might still order a few wings to munch on though. Firehall does make good wings. Hey Steve (PF) Mmmm, yummy."
17128,motv8tr,2006-12-30 00:25:00,2587,"Hope y'all had a good time, I really did want to come, but alas I must pay the bills somehow.  Looking forward to the reports when I get up in the wee hours, heck, some of you might just be getting home by then  Maureen"
