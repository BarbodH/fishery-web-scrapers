16417,danc,2006-12-27 17:50:00,4677,"Like most years, I didn't get out as often as I would have liked to. But I did have some great experiences along the way. Early in the season and quite by accident, I found myself doing my first ever guiding trip. This came about from a ""friend of a friend"" deal. And what a fantastic experience it was. I had two high profile businessmen in the boat with me for a day of Trout fishing. One guy was from South Carolina and the other was from Connecticut. A friend of mine had their two right hand men in his boat at the same time. The guys in my boat went 13 for 13 catching Steelhead, Salmon and a few Lake Trout. My buddy's boat landed 11 fish. Talk about happy clients! We had a blast that day.           Fast forward to late August now. It's my prime time for Brook Trout fishing and I found some time to get out fishing. I did a 4 day trip with a good friend that produced some average Trout, and some decent Pike were accidentally hooked as well.        I also found this on the beach by the boat launch. That's my size 11 shoe in the photo.     The highlight of my year was not a certain fish that I caught. In fact I would have called it a success if I hadn't caught one fish all year. The highlight was meeting and spending quality time with some great OFC'ers. A couple of southern Ontario city boys, Spiel and TEP, made the long trek up north to spend a few days with Sis and I. Mahumba, whom I already knew quite well but never fished with before, also joined us. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this adventure. We caught some decent fish, including a coupe of personal bests.      Sis and Spiel caught a few very pretty fish too.      And I was happy to share this moment with Spiel. My best Brook Trout in a few years. 23 1/2 inches.     Spiel and Jef were wonderful company. And I think that they had a good time as well. The smiles say it all.      I'll be seeing more of them I'm sure.   Grouse hunting was fantastic this fall too. There was more birds than I can recall for quite some time now. I still have several in the freezer for the winter.      And I was fortunate enough to round a corner on a trail to see this guy standing there.    I didn't practice my photography hobby as much as I would have liked to. Here's a couple of shots that I liked though.            So, an early Happy New year to you all. I hope that your 2006 was at least as satisfying as mine and that your 2007 will be even better. Tight lines everyone!!"

The brooktrout pics and the 4 legged ones are great. I remember you taking the photo of the pike head by your foot.  Just think...only a few more months of difficult trolling and we'll be back there again creating more memories."
