Was speaking to Ron yesterday night at the swill and had passed me some ideas of where I may try perching from shore tommorrow morn. Has there been anyone out to PR or TR on the eastern simcoe? Is there still open water to try from shore?  If anyone has any info please PM me where I should try first, if nobody has been out that way, then I'll have to post some water conditions when I get back.  Thanks, HearingFish"
