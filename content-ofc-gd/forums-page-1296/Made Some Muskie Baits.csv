In fact I stayed up and finished them all on Christmas Day evening  They are nothing compared to the baits Roy, Robin or TEP make, but it is was fun   and since I can't go icefishing   it passes the time.  Here's a few pics.....        Here's a size comparison to a regular bass size spinner bait.   Played around with the number of beads, types of blades and length on each and will have to see which works best."
16683,Joey,2006-12-28 20:59:00,9122,"Hey, those are pretty good.  How long do you figure it took you to make just one?  Joey"
16690,bpsbassman,2006-12-28 21:30:00,941,Great job Jim!! Just shows how desperate you are to catch a bigger Musky than Junior! 
16691,lew,2006-12-28 21:30:00,12767,"Those baits turned out really good Jim, but no self respecting musky would ever go after an orange/black lure, so if you mail it to me,  I can dispose of it for you"
16695,bpsbassman,2006-12-28 21:40:00,941,Mighty big of you Lew
16696,lew,2006-12-28 21:41:00,12767,"You know me Roger, I don't mind helping out a friend when it's needed"
16700,fishindevil,2006-12-28 21:47:00,6254,"very nice baits  ,i also make all my own worm harnesses,and lake trout rigs,its a very enjoyable hobby and its amazing when you catch a nice fish on your own baits that you made.  .keep up the great work"
16706,setomonkey,2006-12-28 22:03:00,872,"Nice job, I think it's very cool to make your own lures and then catch fish on those lures. I think the black & orange looks particularly good (sorry Lew!)    Mike"
16709,Rich Clemens,2006-12-28 22:06:00,3131,Looks like the real McCoy there.  Always more appreciated when you make them yourself.  Looks great and be sure to post that 'first fish'.
16720,Roy,2006-12-28 22:36:00,13728,"You did a great job, Jim. I agree with Lew though... you should get rid of any orange/black baits you have. They're nothing but trouble."
16730,Smokey,2006-12-28 23:06:00,1278,They look great. I hope you can post some pics from the success you have with them. I'll be watching for it.
16758,Ron,2006-12-28 23:53:00,1683,You did a fantastic job on them Jim. Let me know when you start taking orders...
16759,Rattletrap2,2006-12-28 23:55:00,1652,Nice work Jim! Just a word of warning though.......do you have any idea what kind of damage you could be doing to your fore arms when those baits suddenly stop very abruptly and tear off in the opposite direction while you are retrieving them? Don't do it! Just leave 'em in your box and all will be good!
16794,Crazyhook,2006-12-29 01:38:00,1154,"Jim beauty Job, I must say I saw Lew catch a musky on the Color!"
16797,Whopper,2006-12-29 01:41:00,2174,Well done Jim!  Nice looking baits  Your probably going to have to hide them from Corey  Whopper
16921,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-29 12:58:00,0,"Thanks for the replies folks  Lew.....black and orange is no good eh...hmmm  Joey, I didn't really time how long it took, the instruction kit is pretty easy to follow."
16966,JFR,2006-12-29 14:47:00,498,"Nice work Jim,"
17145,musky_man,2006-12-30 01:35:00,159,Hey - You did a great job ... Congrats!
