16822,Clampet,2006-12-29 02:51:00,1947,"December 26  Arrived Lake Nipissing Lookout on Hwy 17 westbound about 5 kms west of North Bay. Lake showing open water about 1 km from shore.  December 28 lake frozen for as far as the eye can see, with about 3"" of snow. Temps were -13 C at night and -4C during the day."
16843,urbanangler1990,2006-12-29 03:37:00,933,yup dont see why not? all it takes is a few bone chilly nights for a lake to get a thin coat of ice... -10 to -20 for 2 nights maybe 3 and bamm u got ur frozen over pond.
16848,setomonkey,2006-12-29 03:43:00,872,But won't it take some extended below freezing temps to be safe for ice-fishing? Saw another thread that Rob Hyatt had to cancel a hut booking for early January...  Mike
16851,urbanangler1990,2006-12-29 03:53:00,933,"setomonkey, 3 inches is enough for walking on...and ice fishing with care."
16932,snoil,2006-12-29 13:19:00,139,Maybe for some but not for me.
16985,TJQ,2006-12-29 15:28:00,7806,snoil... no kidding...    -12 last nite
16992,fishnsled,2006-12-29 15:57:00,3520,I had heard that the operators up there were refunding deposits up to the 3rd week in January.  I hope it gets cold for them as I'm sure they are hoping too.
17039,Fisherman,2006-12-29 18:12:00,7201,"It's looking better, scroll to the top right of the sat image, Lake N is frozen over except for a crack in the middle.  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...on.143.250m.jpg"
17102,Clampet,2006-12-29 22:17:00,1947," What I said: ""December 28 lake frozen for as far as the eye can see, with about 3"" of snow."""
17107,Dano,2006-12-29 22:26:00,719,"Thanks for the update Clampet, really appreciated. Always nice to have some first person information."
17115,Carp,2006-12-29 22:48:00,1488,"Wish we could get a few -20 celcius temps a bit further south. It just doesn't feel right not having ice on L.Simcoe. At least a few inches on Cooks Bay to get the season started would be nice.  Heck, what's a Canadian winter without ice ?  ""Florida"""
17188,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-30 04:49:00,2585,"im in North Bay now.  its -9 1145pm Drove by the lake today down by the town docks, there is ice but not alot.  Was in Callandar today too and there was no sign of anything or anyone on the ice leading me to believe its nowhere near safe yet.  Hate to bring bads news but the forecast up here is warming up to +temps next week too.  I really feel for the business owners up here that rely on the ice!"
17198,NANUK,2006-12-30 07:57:00,797," I would say 3"" is the minimum requirement for walking, the question you have to ask yourself is "" is it 3'' everywhere you're walking"" ?? or is there a soft spot, underwater spring or current. be safe!"
