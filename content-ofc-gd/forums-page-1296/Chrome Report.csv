17172,GNODDY,2006-12-30 03:34:00,163,Headed out with a buddy of mine today to hunt for some chrome there getting pretty scarse out here in the east now. Really had to work for this one Both of us  must have re tied 7 or 8 times today but all in all I  went 1 for 2 and he went 0/1. I landed this beauty on my new rod and float reel That was my first fish caught and landed on the new reel and rod and I was very impressed.     Same Fish
