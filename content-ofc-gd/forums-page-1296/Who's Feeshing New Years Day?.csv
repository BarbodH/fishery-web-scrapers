17028,jediangler,2006-12-29 17:38:00,1923,"Fishing? Yes, I suppose you could call it fishing. The Impaler and I are going on our yearly ritual on New Years Day. We go to a nearby conservation area where they lower the water by 8 - 10ft. Then we hit the stump fields looking for snagged lures. After replacing the hooks and split rings, they are ready to go. These lures are already lucky, because we found them and they're free, so our confidence in them is high."
17037,nautifish,2006-12-29 18:09:00,1416,Well i was contemplating on hitting a lake up north with the tinny this weekend.

I hope to be fishing the rivers that are still open for a couple of hours before I have to work in the afternoon. If it is raining I will just have to wait till the 3rd to head out...
