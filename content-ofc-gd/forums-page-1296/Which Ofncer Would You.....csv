15584,Beans,2006-12-24 00:58:00,3339,Me too...Wayne  Thanks for sharing your boat at Lakair...
15909,majorlifts,2006-12-25 00:04:00,171,"  I have a good fishing buddy Ive fished with for 10 years or so now, but Spiel would be the ofner to fly fish with. Seems like a well rounded guy with plenty of experience. See you on the rocky saugeen some day Spiel. Judging by his post, I think a guy that wants to fish with everyone doesnt have to many hang ups or ego problems."
15968,nautifish,2006-12-25 04:10:00,1416,Well fished with BBR & SLEDDED many times as they are pratically neighbors.  There both crazy  I am very new to the board so do not really no anyone yet. Did meet fang last week seems like a great guy.  So its kinda hard for me to say who i would like to fish with.   I guess even if i did allready know alot of you it would be very hard for me to  narrow it down to just one person.  Alot of people on this board who seem to know what they are talking about  when it comes to fishing  and are more than happy to share advice & tips which i think is great.  Allthough i will say this their are two ladies here that i would really like to get out on the water with.
15986,Roy,2006-12-25 06:04:00,13728," Yeah, same here."
16001,MuskyBill,2006-12-25 10:30:00,311,I'll second that 'fishin' with the ladies' thing....
16104,Squid,2006-12-25 22:26:00,1656,"I'll fish with any habs fan, they get in for free. The leafs fan hmmm naww its christmas, I'll take a leaf fan too. Oh and I would like to fish with Lew cause he's great with a net   :worthy:"
16557,daisy_girl58,2006-12-28 05:38:00,116,"Well as for me I have learned so much from my husband.... He has been fishing since he was 3 years old, he is always looking for new ways or experimenting.... But also I would like to fish with everyone here and also have a ladies fish club....  Lorissa"
16581,DT10Sam,2006-12-28 13:26:00,480,"With Lew and Squid...........I'm sure it would be a blast.  Regards, Sam"
16798,Crazyhook,2006-12-29 01:46:00,1154,"I have a huge list!!!  basically anyone who leases the vanilla Krispy Kremes for me!  hope to get out with a bunch in 07. I got to spent a few days on the water with Musky Matt an had a blast, and Lew had me Lewsmiling all day!"
16934,Chris,2006-12-29 13:23:00,405,"Well....already fished with Thorpe, so for a muskie guy, Lew is the next logical pick. But he's kinda far away so maybe I'll have to drag Crazyhook out for a day on the water in '07. Don't worry Crazy, I'll wave the guiding fees for the day."
16946,lew,2006-12-29 13:46:00,12767," Sheeesh Chris, I can be at your house in 4 hours from the trailer, just gimme a date and I'll pick Jamie up on the way thru"
17016,Guest Trophymuskie,2006-12-29 17:06:00,0,.
17035,Eddyk,2006-12-29 18:00:00,195,ChrisS I should be living up that way soon. You and I and Crazyhook can have our own swill.
17036,Chris,2006-12-29 18:01:00,405,"From Lew:  Lew, bring eddyk too and we can get Jamie to show us all how to work a bulldawg.  Richard, as usual, I have no clue what you're talking about.    If you're talking about the fish I caught with Marc that was 51.5"", the one in your pic was 47""."
15011,danc,2006-12-22 04:00:00,4677,Roy..
15019,Mike the Pike,2006-12-22 04:36:00,3421,"I will fish with any OFC er who will help me catch my first Muskie,My boat or yours I have all the Muskie stuff but the dam pike always end up on my line."
15023,Dondorfish,2006-12-22 04:52:00,1000,"Mike - easy - fish the kawarthas - no pike and lots of muskies. I fish Chemong all spring, summer and fall - always catch them while walleye fishing.  Let me know this summer when your in the area and we'll see if we can't get you one.   Don"
15054,Whopper,2006-12-22 12:56:00,2174," Rick that night was indeed a blast. Your are also correct about the rockbass   , but I did manage one eye that night. Reading this sent cold chills down my spine and took me right back to the moment, priceless!  Thanks  Whopper"
15068,crappiesteve,2006-12-22 13:46:00,220,"I,d fish with any one,if I could get out fishing.  but I would really like to fish with TJ in his pink TuTu.  Steve"
15141,misfish,2006-12-22 16:24:00,29133,"I,ll keep fishing with Terry ,as I havent finished picking his brain yet on the bass.  Got to fish with alot of guys here,and even just met them.  Been out with Charlesn once during a pro/am.Awesome day. Spiel,Crappiesteve on the ice is a great day out. Joey and Tybo on the ice aswell.Good laughs. Always full of info GBfisher.LOL JR,Lew, always good to learn from guys that have the musky experience.  If I had to pick just one .......................................................      Im not going to say every OFC,ER as I wouldnt."
15226,Moosebunk,2006-12-22 21:15:00,3970,There's certainly a good few quality characters I'd share some time with.  Which ones would likely know who they are.
15234,aplumma,2006-12-22 21:32:00,6896,"Since Joey made an easy wish to fulfill.... Joey you got your wish I would be happy to take you out fishin at Lak Air this year I will show you how to get small mouth off of the rock walls using tube baits and rattle traps.  I also want to fish with Moereen,Greencoachdog, chevy 4x4 and Lady Walleye, Spiel, Crappie steve B&B this up coming year. I need a bigger boat or more time to fish with all of my Friends up North(except Glen). I figure I will  just keep fishing with a few people each year until I get to share time with all of you.  Art"
15242,Greencoachdog,2006-12-22 21:48:00,8163,"I want to fish with all OFNCers... at the same time! I'm thinking hugeass charter boat on the Gulf of Mexico for a 2 day trip... would that be a party or what?    BTW... I'll bring the ""shine"""
15249,FinS,2006-12-22 22:07:00,463,i would like to fish with ofners who like to finess their presentations
15295,tjsa,2006-12-23 01:25:00,1578,"I would like to fish with ONFC'rs for fish I cannot target. Lew, Eh, Roy, and others for musky, in their respective back yards, Art and Joe for catfish, Greencoachdog(if he keeps his shirt on and his pants up) using those sabiki rigs would be fun for whatever will bite, the toronto waterfront crew like Highdrifter, FHR, Grilw, Snag, etc, always like those reports even though most of the time all they catch is those skanky pike which I do have lots of up here, lol. Dan the Man for a sturgeon trip, Moosebunk for one of his across the bay in a big skinny boat, trips.  Aww man, there's too many choices here, cannot possibly mention them all.  One of these days I gotta get out with my own local OFC'rs, DanC and Mahumba, but its hard when I have my own fishing buds that I always go with."
15299,muskymatt,2006-12-23 01:32:00,2608,I'd like to spend a day on a boat with Marc Thorpe. Or Moosebunk Matt
15303,express168,2006-12-23 01:46:00,327,"Alot of knowledgeable fisherman here but I think I would really like to try fishing with Lew for my first musky, Irishfield and Spiel because they are always willing to help a person on their posts,and former OFNer Steve even though he has a job now. I should try to make arrangements to get to the Lakair G2G this year and finally meet and fish with some of you. So when is it going to be scheduled for this year?"
15312,Ben_Daniels,2006-12-23 02:10:00,435,"I think it would be a fun time to go out fishing with Bigbass Rich, I think that would be very interesting....."
15341,pigeonfisher,2006-12-23 04:14:00,696,"Can I ask, is Chicken Wings with Dano and KyleM out of the question?"
15342,bucktail,2006-12-23 04:29:00,1857,Hmmmm nobody loves me........
15343,kemper,2006-12-23 04:59:00,2232,"Id love to hit the rivers with jangles and CC, they could teach me a thing or two about steelheading!"
15347,mepps,2006-12-23 05:56:00,1301,I'd love to spend a day on the water with Marc Thorpe
15350,irishfield,2006-12-23 06:16:00,26272, Same deal here bucktail...guess we'd better pair up ! LOL
15352,OhioFisherman,2006-12-23 08:56:00,6623,"The only ofners I have met are Deg and his daughter Ruth, he is a nice old guy! LOL and is daughter is great! There ya go hammered from the south side Deg! LOL Way too many choices to list, way to much water to cover!  The mission might be fishin, but it`s supposed to be fun!"
15414,misfish,2006-12-23 15:06:00,29133,"  Wayne,I want go hunting with ya. Here chick chick chick. bang   Forgot to mention,cant wait to fish with Fang next summer,and hope to get out with Harrison aswell a trip out east to fish with Justin."
15450,JustinHoffman,2006-12-23 17:34:00,482,"You got it, Brian.  Would love to host you for a couple days of bass fishing!  Good Fishing,  Justin"
15452,MuskyBill,2006-12-23 17:38:00,311,"I've fished a bunch of you's guys, & enjoyed every minute, but the one I still haven't fished with yet, is TEP. Jef & I have tried for about 18 months, but our conflicting schedules have always spoiled the fun.  Yep, TEP...."
15471,Carp,2006-12-23 18:45:00,1488,"    A face only a mother could love. I give the photographer all the credit fo making you look presentable.     No worries Wayne, I'll fish with ya anytime.... 'cause I know I'll catch all the fish.  Ya have a real nice tackle box full of muskie lures though."
15477,Spiel,2006-12-23 19:01:00,9065,"....I've fished with you Wayne, what more could you possibly want....lol"
14873,Headhunter,2006-12-21 20:26:00,5703,Well it's a slow day at the office and a slow day on the board so... I thought I'd start this and see where it goes?! Which OFNCer would you like to fish with in 2007? I'll start.... anyone and everyone! Although I get a feelng that spending a day in a boat with Johnny Bass would be interesting! HH
14877,ccmtcanada,2006-12-21 20:42:00,7971,I've already had the pleasure of fishing with fishindevil and I look forward to more days in the spring chasing some even bigger fish!  I'd also like to meet up with Rick...to share some Walleye secrets.
14881,Joey,2006-12-21 20:46:00,9122,"I have had the pleasure of fishing with alot of the members of this board and want to again in the future, but I guess I'd like to get out and fish with Art (Aplumma) and learn a few southern tricks, except for noodling  Joey"
14882,bpsbassman,2006-12-21 20:47:00,941,"I know I'm leaving many out. I would like to fish with Lew again. Plan on fishing with Baby Herc at Lakair. Whopper, GCD, Dustin K, Dave Mercer and the list goes on."
14885,fishergirl72,2006-12-21 20:56:00,455,"Well I always go fishing with Fishindevil, but I would like to fish with ccmt and blyght and Pete Maina"
14886,FishFinder,2006-12-21 20:59:00,481,"Id like to fish with jangles, so i can teach him some things on steelhead and so he can learn a bit. LOL jk"
14891,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-21 21:04:00,2050,"I'd like to hit he water with some of the T.O. hardcores (SNAG and his crew) because i'm newer to the city.... and next summer i'm going to heckle PHOTOZ to do some carp fishing! I'd also like to take CCMTCANADA out in the boat cause him and Blyght are, in my opinion, the newbies of the year! I also can't leave out Fishnsled cause he introduced me to OFC, and he's a closet rockstar!"
14906,steve_paul,2006-12-21 21:41:00,658,"Shared a boat this summer for the first time with an OFC'er - Musky Bill, had a great time and learned a ton.  Looking forward to doing that again in 2007.  Would also love to share a boat with Roy sometime, I think your wit and sense of humour would keep things lively even on a slow day."
14907,setomonkey,2006-12-21 21:45:00,872,"I've only fished a few OFNCers -- FHR, tinbanger, gforce -- and would happily fish with them again.  Lots of OFNCers I'd like to fish with, it's hard to choose b/c there are so many experienced anglers who know their stuff and sound like great company too.  Lew, Raf & Diplip, Irishfield, MuskyBill, Whopper, Spiel, the plumma brothers... (this could be a long, long post)  Mike"
14912,Spiel,2006-12-21 22:05:00,9065,".....Oh my, this is an easy one. I'd like to fish with everyone here at least once before I die. I've already had the pleasure of numerous trips shared with many good folk from this board and can't think of one I wouldn't fish with again. Mind you I have not shared a boat with many whom I've spent weekends with so I guess I'll need to live to the ripe old age of 372 to fit everyone in.    Well a least I have a goal!"
14919,Whopper,2006-12-21 22:28:00,2174,"Thanks Roger & Mike.  I'm with Spiel on this one, I'd really like to fish with most here and at the rate I'm going it's going to take a long time.  I have had the pleasure to fish with Wayne & Lew, spent some time with a few others and have had a great time with all.  I would like to make a suggestion though, actually this was a topic of discussion at Lakair g2g. It would be nice to swap boat partners even if for a few hours or 1/2 a day during the g2g, especially for those that are there for more than a day or two.  Whopper"
14932,bassmaster4,2006-12-21 23:00:00,801,i have gone fishin with xrap a few times this year and it was great hopefully some more in 2007
14933,Guest Trophymuskie,2006-12-21 23:06:00,0,Last year when I answered this one I got banned for a week.  I did get to share the boat with quite a few ofners this year and many for the first time and had a blast with them all.  I'm looking forward to fishing with many more next year.
14943,GbayGiant,2006-12-21 23:54:00,1780,"I would fish with anyone on OFC because we all have something in common, FISHING.  On another note I think Lew and Pete Maina would be great to fish with, help to upgrade my Muskie skills."
14944,Roy,2006-12-21 23:55:00,13728,"There are not too many people in our great community that I wouldn't fish with. None that I can think of. This coming soft water season I will fish with a lot more.  steve_paul, Thank you for the kind words.  Richard, you were not banned, you were suspended. Banning is forever. And you know why. Maybe we can fish together this coming season."
14945,Rich Clemens,2006-12-22 00:00:00,3131,"As I am one who has not personnally had the opportunity to meet anyone from the board, let alone fish with anyone  ... exactly how many members do we have now ?  pick one, or two, or three, or ....  Who knows maybe I can swing a trip to the Lakair GTG this summer and meet, greet, and fish with someone.  I would consider myself a 'blessed' guy."
14971,Nanook,2006-12-22 02:05:00,565,"One might say I'm in my 'twilight years' for fishing  , and I wish this 'Board had come on the scene many years ago. They are ALL a great bunch of guy's/gals  , and I'd fish with any one of them if I had the chance. It would be VERY difficult to single out anyone for preference"
14973,fishnsled,2006-12-22 02:11:00,3520," That pretty much sums it up for me as well.  And for those that I have fished with, I'd fish with anyone of them in a heartbeat again. They will always have a spot in my boat.   In 2007 I'll try to get as many in as I can. There's a great group of people here and it certainly would be nice to meet them all."
14976,Dutch,2006-12-22 02:16:00,831,"A few:  b2kptbo BBR Sledded Musky Bill High Drifter Musky John Musky Mike  Wait - have fished with all those guys already - looking forard to September 07 on the 'O', or any other chance I get.  As for others:  Moosebunk - in his home territory of course, does anyone need to know why? Lew - for some Musky tips and perhaps a 'fiddy or two (no, not the beer although that would be okay too). Charlesn - learn some tips from a pro."
14984,dr_freelgood,2006-12-22 02:42:00,13,I never saw my name on any list.....LOL I would love to hook up with legend we call Lew.
14988,bigfish1965,2006-12-22 02:50:00,3382,"I think the most fun I had in a long time was one evening at Lakair. We had a small floatilla in Pike Bay and we were fishing for walleye. We all had a few fish and across the bay we ere taunting and cheering each other. I think it was Whopper...can't remember...but one of the guys was slaying the rock bass. GCD couldn't land a walleye to save his life..we were all killing ourselves laughing and having a total blast. The night prior to that we were fishing further up the lake and somehow a boat-to-boat food fight ensued. Can't recall exactly but either Spiel or TJ started that one...again we were all busting a gut laughing.  You just can't explain the complete comraderie and the universal acceptance you experience with all the great guys and gals from OFC Funny how we can tear each other a new one on the board, but we all come together when it matters most."
14989,irishfield,2006-12-22 02:54:00,26272, 
14996,joonmoon,2006-12-22 03:20:00,528,"Ya would have to agree with Dutch fishin with BBR and Sleded is a blast, hopin to get out with you guys a bit this year on the ice again...hopin for the big freeze. I think to fish with anyone here would be really cool. But I'm really likin the shots comin from DanC and the Thunder Bay area...not a very local drive from here though."
15001,Carp,2006-12-22 03:26:00,1488,"I've fished with a bunch of OFNCers and met a whole bunch more. So far, I haven't met or fished with anyone I don't like. OFNCers are a different breed."
15010,Rich,2006-12-22 03:47:00,3927,"Every OFC'er I've met so far has been great and a lot of fun, would like to get in MuskyBill's boat next year! Even though we already met we have not actually fished together. But I'd love to fish with anyone here, all great people!"
