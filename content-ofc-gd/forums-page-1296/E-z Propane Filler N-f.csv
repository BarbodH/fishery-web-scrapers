17108,G-loomis,2006-12-29 22:26:00,19,has anyone seen a e-z propane filler I seen one at cabela's but I do not want to have to order...     
17110,Terry,2006-12-29 22:38:00,14456,do know   but    they are easy to make  find an old BBQ cut the hose off find an old propane soldiering torch take the flame nozzle off and shove the metal pipe up the hose and clamp it  you now have  two male end large to small adapter
17118,Rattletrap2,2006-12-29 22:59:00,1652,"Like Terry says, easy enough to make....but kind of scarey. I don't know that they are legal in Canada though. It wouldn't take much to overfill the small cans. They do have a pressure relief of sorts, but hydrostatic pressure is not something to mess around with. Just be careful, and don't fill beyond 80% of the stated capacity on the can."
17121,Terry,2006-12-29 23:11:00,14456,"yeah, I don't think they are legal in canada  I have used them for years I aways used the 20lb cylinder for a BBQ or 2 before I use it to refill the small cylinders what you are really doing is equalizing the pressure in the 2 cylinders years ago we would put one of them in the freezer before we hooked them up. but I can't remember which one"
17122,douG,2006-12-29 23:23:00,2693,"You want to put the empty tank in the freezer, Terry.  I wonder if this adaptor could be used so that you could use a small bottle if your 20 lb tank runs out."
17138,tjsa,2006-12-30 01:22:00,1578,"Yes, I have heard of that technique of putting the bottles in the freezer for refilling, but since the cost of them simply outweighs the possible danger, I figger, screw it, I just buy them."
