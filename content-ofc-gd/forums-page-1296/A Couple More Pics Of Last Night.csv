I took some pic's of everyone co-mingling.  Alot didn't turn out as I had hoped, but the new camera I ordered is on the way so hopefully my future pictures will turn out alot better.  Here's some of the random shots I got last night.  Pete (Squid) Looking his charming self.    Here's a good one of Remo and Laura    Remo and his other girlfriend Raf    Ron and Rattletrap    Biteme (Peter) looking dapper    Doug, after scarfing I lost count of how many chicken wings    Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we have Fishfarmer sitting, and of course Rick sipping on beer and TonyB sitting also    Spiel getting ready to pour and tybo having a good laugh    As I said, if I took your picture and its not here its because all the rest of my pics are either fuzzy or the flash didn't go off  A special thanks to Ron for bringing the St. Croix rod I won in the Lake Simcoe Musky Restoration Project fundraiser draw.  I really appreciate that Ron, and a very worthy cause that is.  Maybe BBR can donate to it due to his oversight last night    Right Rich  Cheers all and can't wait til the next get together.  Joey"
