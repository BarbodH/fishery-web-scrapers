17332,fishindevil,2006-12-30 20:05:00,6254,"well i just got back from the lake i drove around the whole lake and looked at the ice from different areas and the situation is not good,   the lake is about 70% frozen over ,but there is lots of open water and very thin ice everywhere  else,out from shore in lots of places it is about 3-6 inches of ice but there is pockets of open water everywhere,so there will prob be people out near the shores but it is NOT SAFE AND THATS FOR SURE,  now we cant even get a little 12ft tin boat out like we were planing to do,oh well have to wait a little while longer i guess"
17343,ShaunB,2006-12-30 21:21:00,73,I was wondering if anyone knoew if the area by the causeway will be free of ice.  I am guessing it wont be so there probably aren't any shore fishing spots that will be available.
17368,nautifish,2006-12-30 23:08:00,1416,Well i headed out to shore fish today and hit a couple of different spots. All that was caught all blooming day was one pumpkin seed.....lol....But this was lake eire in my neck of the woods today aboslutley beautiful and they're was even some whistler swans on the lake. Big surprise i did not think they were in this erea this time of year. Beautiful majestic birds they are. So tommorow morning bright and early i am heading out on the tinny.
