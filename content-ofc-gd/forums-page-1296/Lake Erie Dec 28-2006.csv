16980,Bob Devine,2006-12-29 15:22:00,251,I got a chance to fish Lake Erie yesterday. I can't believe it is Dec 28 with NO ice. Yee haw! Here are some pics.  
16990,setomonkey,2006-12-29 15:57:00,872,Who would expect to see Erie or O reports at this time of year?  Nice catch...  Mike
17013,tjsa,2006-12-29 16:57:00,1578,"WTG Bob, thanks for sharing."
17015,fishindevil,2006-12-29 17:03:00,6254,"WAY TO GO,nice report & pics of those tasty walleyes,who would have thought of you got out on Erie,on the 28th,of dec,to go fishin"
17017,iceguy,2006-12-29 17:09:00,341,Nice fish Bob. If you had of caught  those fish at BOQ they probably have a few more pounds on them.  It's nice to be on the boat after christmas. With the current forcast you might wanna keep your boat out. Happy New years!
17021,Bob Devine,2006-12-29 17:21:00,251,"Yeah I hear ya about BOQ walleyes. If Lake Erie walleyes feed a family of 4, how many family members do Quinte eyes feed?? But on a serious note, I would have thrown those walleyes back but I went out with a meat eater. I like to keep my walleyes in the 15-18"". Can you say ""Water Chicken"" mmmm good !!"
17024,iceguy,2006-12-29 17:28:00,341,"Your right on the money with the eating sizes. I always realease the big ones(inluding the 8# in the pic). Only kept one over 10 because of a fellow meat eater caught it. Do you have much success for Erie Smallmouths, Would love to try it next year.Be willing to trade a Lake Ontario salmon fishing trip for a Erie trip. Have Happy New Years!"
17029,Smokey,2006-12-29 17:39:00,1278,Nice fish guys. I was down in Port Maitland on Christmas day and the lake was dead calm. I was wondering how the fishing would be in the big lake this time of the year. Thanks for the report.
17051,moemoe,2006-12-29 18:48:00,352,"Great report Bob, and I thought everyone had put the boats away"
17075,Handlebarz,2006-12-29 20:07:00,3790,Hey Bob you did what I have been thingking about doing I was getting the itch to call smellinfishy and maybe try out the river
17079,Whopper,2006-12-29 20:12:00,2174,"Good report!  Got a call this morning from one of my buddies that has a place near Port Clinton begging me to take my boat up for the weekend   , about the time I got it up there it with my luck we'd get a Denver storm.  Nice fish!  Whopper"
17088,Bob Devine,2006-12-29 21:06:00,251,"Whopper, we were just east of Port Clinton. Winds are suppose to be light again tomorrow. Yeah light on Lake Erie LOL, I may run down there again Sat. We were running Reef Runner cranks back 20-75 back off Offshore boards."
17130,K-K-DAWG,2006-12-30 01:03:00,31,"Well, Well Mr Devine....I`m stuck in the office editing shows and your out and about catching those tasty `eyes...grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...shame, er,... good for you. Speaking of Erie, just finished editing the show with you and Uncle Scotty slamming all those walleyes back in May- what a fishery! Anyone who likes catching walleyes, is gonna love that show!... And it all begins January 11 `07 on WFN.  dawg`s gone to bed!! www.extremeanglertv.com"
17142,OhioFisherman,2006-12-30 01:30:00,6623,"Nice fish! They were getting walleyes at night near shore on the south side of Erie, a yearly thing if the weather is good. Dude got a 32 inch 15 pounder Late November, saw the pic in the paper. It can be a mad house at nite on the piers fishing for them."
17453,Bob Devine,2006-12-31 01:47:00,251,Fished Erie again with the same program and got a couple good fish. Didn't bring any meat hunters and released them all.
