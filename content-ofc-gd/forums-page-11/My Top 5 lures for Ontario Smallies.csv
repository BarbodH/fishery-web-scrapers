1079588,gordy28,2022-04-02 19:01:00,638,Some good adds here - spybaiting is interesting On the cottage lake I fish I think smallies suspend quite a bit in open water (feeding on minnows I assume) - from what I have read/watched spybaiting may be the thing Cheers Andrew  
1079589,Snidley,2022-04-02 19:52:00,620,I bought a Duo Realis spybait at the swap meet. I've never tried one but I've seen TV anglers say they work when little else will. Going to give it a try this summer.
1079590,Fang,2022-04-02 23:13:00,1330,Ahhhh hahaha good one chumbawumba loved that album all those lures designed by that famous Finnish lure maker Lipra Yadsloof
1079592,AKRISONER,2022-04-03 03:07:00,5558,"Be patient…it’s a really boring way to fish, at least imo but when the presentation is correct they will outfish a heck of a lot of stuff. Also just a ridiculously versatile bait. our last NGTA meeting we actually got to listen to a live seminar with the owner of DUO Japan. I learned more than I could have ever imagined about spy baiting lol. coming directly from the owner, don’t throw it on anything heavier than 8lb test. And make sure the line you are using is of a high quality, he has his reasoning and you gotta believe the guy, he basically is single handedly responsible for making these baits hit the main stream again. i watched chonger throwing a spy bait up in 4 feet of water last year and it was just something I had never even considered, go figure they’d eat the spy bait but wouldn’t eat a ned rig."
1079594,Snidley,2022-04-03 03:26:00,620,"Every time i watch Bob Izumi throw them he breaks them off so i guess he's using light line too. If I owned an expensive lure company i would have instructions to use 4lb line. The lure will get bit for sure AND there will be lots of lost lures. Create demand and fulfill sales quotas in one recommendation lol. The Mega Bass and Jackal guys do the same thing for even more expensive lures. Lots of their rods, including baitcasters are for unusually low line  weights as well. Highly conditioned bass in Japan one assumes. My spybait is a very realistic lure but i wonder what the fish thinks the props on it represent,"
1079595,AKRISONER,2022-04-03 11:29:00,5558,"You can’t see the prop, you’ll be blown away by how fast they spin once in the water, it’s almost ultra sonic, even the sound of them, you can hear them when they get near the boat. The bait actually looks exactly like a shiner but the shiner is sending off high pitched TINNNGGG sound."
1079618,BillM,2022-04-04 15:48:00,17367,"You're definitely not seeing the prop spin when the bait is in the water, it's spinning way too fast.  All you'll really notice is a subtle side to side roll and you'll wonder why fish bother to even eat these things.    Then you'll have days where it's fish after fish after fish and they won't touch anything else.    My setup is nothing special.  2500 series Sustain FE, 6lb Nanofil and a 10lb flouro lead on a 7ft med/fast Avid..  If I could change one thing about my setup it would be the rod,  something around 8ft, much softer tip (Think glass crankbait rod) with some backbone for long casts would be perfect.     You wanna make bomber casts with these things and yes, it's the most boring type of fishing there is.  You really need to focus on your retrieve and slow it to a crawl to make sure you're in the zone you want be fishing."
1079620,Snidley,2022-04-04 18:51:00,620,"I've got an 8 foot Airrus 457 Co Matrix (actually Sirrus before trademark infringement made them change the name) It's 8' 12-30lb and 1/2oz to 1 3/8oz lure rating. You would think it's a broomstick but it is my walleye trolling rod in my 'toon. I catch walleyes, smallmouth and even on occasion chinnies with it. It's so forgiving it's not funny. Ken  Whiting gave it to me and I've been looking to find another for years. At one time I had 3 of them but i foolishly sold the casting versions because the reelseat was not up to salmon fishing. The reel would literally pop off the rod with a salmon on. The blank is truly amazing on Co Matricx 457's. Buy it if you ever see one for sale."

You can’t approach the kawarthas necessarily like you can g bay, and even then honey harbour is totally different than pointe au baril. i won some money throwing a jackhammer in October but I wouldn’t necessarily call it a “smallie bait” even if I do catch a lot of big smallmouth throwing one.

1079516,AKRISONER,2022-03-28 18:11:00,5558,"can we all agree, the topwater smallie bite on opener every year is the most fun way to catch these fish. Some of my most epic sessions of all time are on opener week are those warm calm evenings throwing a walking bait...my heart skips a beat just thinking about it."

That being said, my fav topwater baits are the original Japanese Yellow Magics."
1079531,AKRISONER,2022-03-29 19:07:00,5558,"my mind is literally blown. The first bait in my hands every single year at 5am on opener is a walking bait, it immediately tells me how far along into the spawning cycle the fish are. Those first few days they are always seemingly somewhere between 0-10 FOW. Interestingly one year i spent the first half an hour skunked and I was in a panic wonder what the heck was going on, and it was simply that I wasnt casting shallow enough. I literally had to bank my lures off of the rocks aiming at any nook that had reeds protruding up, sure enough everything was still up protecting beds. I take the entire week off every year and fish every day and its the same pattern, by the end of opener week the fish transition out off of the edge and start slipping more and more into their summer pattern. Hence why the evening/morning is always my favourite time to fish. The smallies come right back up as the sun goes down. Find a sunken island and throw a topwater right on top of it and the action is seemingly non stop. I recall one evening having 6 fish on 6 consecutive casts to the exact same marker on top of a shoal.  UGGGGHHHH just thinking about this is giving me crazy anxiety and a pit in my stomach...were close, but still so far hahaha. Opener morning on G bay is perhaps one of the most special moments in any fishing season. Unlike the kawarthas/tri lakes opener (that i also fish the week prior every single year) the morning is still dead quiet up there. Usually you dont even see a boat for the first couple of hours of fishing. I cant believe its been 4 years since this photo was taken, but heres a photo at 7am opener morning. "
1079533,BillM,2022-03-29 21:01:00,17367,"I love Gbay opener.  Especially if the winds are down and I can go fish my spots that are out in the big water.   I usually start with a spinnerbait (And like you said, right up in the rocks).  If nothing, then I'll toss a 1/2-3/4oz bullet sinker in front of one and fish it a bit deeper but still pretty fast.  If that doesn't work out comes the spybait and I start picking apart those deep sections (8-12ft).    Hasn't failed me yet.  Topwaters and the big open water blue water of Gbay has never been a good combination for me.   Now, if I go in shore a bit where the water is off colour, that's a completely different game."
1079541,AKRISONER,2022-03-30 13:01:00,5558,"funny bill, im spilling my beans here a bit, but to be fair I havent spent enough time in the near area yet, nor have I bothered to explore the outer reaches into the bay yet as you can imagine I had more than enough water to cover closer to home last year. I still have areas that I havent really picked apart yet, a new bigger boat though will give me some more confidence to go through those big water sections and explore. My experience fishing the bay now for a decade though has taught me one thing is that there is a sweet spot, not too far out, but not too far in is where the biggest fish are. Not that there are not big fish to be caught thats for sure. But if im out trying to catch 5 4lbers, at least in my experience there is a sweet spot. This speaks larger volumes to the concept of finding ""transitional areas"". its really been something ive narrowed down while tournament fishing too, not surprisingly big fish like options, and the way G bay is naturally structured is that its two different lakes, one inside and one outside...to me the fish think why not have both.

1079551,Snidley,2022-03-31 00:17:00,620,"I get them directly from Japan. Even there the Worming Crank Shots are hard to find. There is a guy who has some on Ebay. He lives in Toronto but he forces you to buy through EBay itself. He also has Eco Gears. Dave Chong, on here, has some Norries but not Worming Crank Shots. I saw them at his booth at the Hamilton Swap Meet last week. A couple of big cranks and some small jerk baits. He will be at the Toronto Swap meet I'm sure.  I cannot vouch for those particular lures but i will say everything I've used from Norries has worked at least somewhat They are expensive but today everything is pricey. I live down the street from Bass Pro in St Catherines and there, a J13 is $18 and a Williams Whitefish is $19. Most lures are at least $10, most are more. At the swap meet spoons were going for a max of $5 and lots for a dollar or two. I bought lots of mint Japanese hardbaits for between $5 and max $7.50. Good ones that work for sure too. My buddy bagged a 9' St Croix Avid rod that was near new for $150. St Croix does not even make them anymore so it was a great deal. It was my buddies first time at the swap meet and he also won a brand new Shimano rod worth about $150. He's now a swap meet enthusiast."
