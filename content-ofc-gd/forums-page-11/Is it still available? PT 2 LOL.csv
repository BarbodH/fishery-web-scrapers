I say,how about this much ? Ok, So I will not say what I paid,but I felt like a thief,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, LOL I have looked over a lot of them. Nice to find the custom fit one. Leer Buddy even helped remove from the old truck and set up on mine. Bolts were rusty on the clamps and snapped. He gave me replaced with new. He is local and has a small scrap shop. He has loads of good steel rims. I will be back to get my winter ones from him. Real nice guy. Now to look for 2 locking handles and a blow up mattress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Ram is starting to look really sharp.  "
