1079811,pics,2022-04-14 19:09:00,1268,Same shift I'm on.. no such thing as a 4 day work week in the steel mills..
1079820,dave524,2022-04-15 11:02:00,4508,"WorkedÂ  3 12's one week and 4 12's the next , 2 week rotation , that is 7x12=84Â  so actually picked up 4 hours O.T. every 2 weeksÂ  and no 5 day work week"
1079859,akaShag,2022-04-20 01:05:00,2073,"Well, I did get my refund as well, and put it away. You guys with those 40 and 44 hour work weeks had the world by the tail.Â  In my line of work, 80 hours a week was not considered unusual, and we were paid for 37.5 hours a week.Â  Period, no such thing as overtime pay for salaried people.Â  But the pension is golden, and I am not complaining.ðŸ˜‰ Doug"
1079893,410001661,2022-04-22 00:53:00,127,Please do not say teacher - LOL

1079669,Terry,2022-04-07 18:44:00,14456,you lucky bugger Can I borrow your horse shoe clean it first please
1079670,Spiel,2022-04-07 19:24:00,9065,I'm certain given his winnings Terry he has more than one. I too have asked to borrow (a clean) one.
1079671,misfish,2022-04-07 19:27:00,29133,"$1.58 this morning at Costco Bill. 90 lt tank was not cheap, but my travel is limited. Start my new job tomorrow. Thank god it,s only a min drive. The only thing is,I have weekdays to fish now,so that might cut into my savings. LOL  "
1079676,irishfield,2022-04-08 01:24:00,26272,"Yep, and folks told me I'd never get away with not paying for the previous two years !! LOL Had to pay the 15 bucks a year for the sleds today though.. "
1079677,irishfield,2022-04-08 01:26:00,26272,"Just make sure you guys all register your plates! As the money generator is going to be fines for running ""expired"" plates!"
1079686,aplumma,2022-04-08 12:43:00,6896,"That is a really nice win brother, congratulations. Art"
1079704,Wallyman,2022-04-08 20:08:00,31,"Got mine in the mail today but, save your refund for annual safeties !!!ðŸ¤«"
1079708,Rizzo,2022-04-08 23:03:00,4754,Spent most of mine taking the wife out to Beertown for dinner tonight.
1079712,410001661,2022-04-09 14:14:00,127,"3 vehicles netted me $1,220........sad to say I think Justin is going to screw us for 10x that and I just do not know how yet"
1079730,Hack_Fisherman,2022-04-10 11:40:00,720,Looking forward to my refund. Wish the 4 day work week article I read wasnâ€™t an April fools joke. I vote for whomever tables that one! We work too goddamn much
1079731,dave524,2022-04-10 14:39:00,4508,"Worked 3 12's one week and 4 12's the next most of my career, 20/30 years ago, worked every other weekend but the ones you didn't were 3 days weekends"
1079748,410001661,2022-04-11 14:07:00,127,"But you do know that working a 4 day week will reduce your pay by 20%Â  I think a 4 way work week is a terrible idea.Â  You think that supply chain issues are bad now imagine when factories reduce production by 20% - contractors, retailers, restaurants."
1079749,Terry,2022-04-11 15:29:00,14456,"Well depends on how many hours you work a day, in the summer we use to work 10 hours a day four days a week my math says I didnâ€™t lose any pay"
1079750,misfish,2022-04-11 17:40:00,29133,"New job shifts are 4 days 10 hrs, both days and afternoon. My shift is Friday-Sunday day shift , 3 12,s paid 40. I have to say,I would take both,but having 4 days off , is nice. Plenty of time to do lots of stuff, and no weekend crowds."
1079751,misfish,2022-04-11 18:05:00,29133,Mail day. Got a couple of them this morning. The Zep is a perfect match to the custom I won a few weeks ago.   
1079752,lew,2022-04-11 18:07:00,12766,"Back in my days as a fireman we had a great shift. We'd work 4 days then get 6 days off, then work 4 nights and get 4 days off, then we'd do 3 days followed by 3 nights and get 4 days off and that was the month done. We worked 10 hour days and 14 nights so it was long shifts in fewer days but lots of time off in-between. Basically it was 7 day shifts & 7 night shifts a month that worked out to 168 hours a month or 42 hours a week I've been retired 22 years now but these days they work 7 shifts per month and each shift is 24 hours which again is 168 hours per month.."
1079753,Canuck,2022-04-11 18:25:00,491,Hmmmmm.Â  Feeling good about getting your own money back?Â  That is Trudeau's approach to the carbon tax rebate.
1079765,410001661,2022-04-12 18:37:00,127,That is not what the Lib's are referring to when they talk about a 4 day work week.Â  While you are at it go for a 24hr shift like the fire fighters - 7 x 24hr shifts a month and your done.
1079766,410001661,2022-04-12 18:42:00,127,I still prefer my schedule.........the life of a sales engineer (no punching clocks for this guy). Get paid to golf and fish......I would add hunting as well but I just need to find a good customer that likes to hunt - LOL.Â  Flexible schedule so LOTS of time for fishing and hunting & for the most part I can work remotely.
1079780,LostAnotherOne,2022-04-13 00:15:00,956,"I look after a bunch of college buildings in Brantford which a few are unfortunately located next to a homeless shelter.Â  I see those fire guys everyday helping people who overdose.Â  I have my opinion about that but I'll keep that to myself.Â  Lew, how was the overdose situation when you were still working?"
1079781,glen,2022-04-13 01:23:00,2641,I held out till the end of paying for my stickers and now I sit here waiting for my money back. Â Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s a new rod or reel. Maybe just some gas money for towing. Â I check the mail every day and nothing. Â Can I get the interest money too?Â  	what were these stickers for? It was just another tax. Â Can I get a refund for all the stickers Iâ€™ve bought over the years?
1079782,lew,2022-04-13 10:39:00,12766,"We'd see it the odd time but certainly nothing like what's happening in some parts of the country today. And as far as the sticker rebate, I got a cheque yesterday for $320."
