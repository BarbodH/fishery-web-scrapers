Bought a lightly used Wilderness Systems Pungo 120. will be putting a couple rod holders on for a rod and a net. any advice on small lakes, rivers/creeks to fish near Peterborough would be appreciated. Smallmouth, Largemouth Bass would be main targets.  Thanks! "

1080325,duke2555,2022-05-19 14:44:00,19,Where to put in on Pigeon River? Is there lots of boat traffic? Thanks
1080328,AKRISONER,2022-05-19 17:28:00,5558,"if you are looking to avoid boat traffic, leave the kawarthas entirely and head north. Theres a public boat launch near emily park. Go out on a Tuesday morning early and you should be able to easily avoid any crowds.  Bass doesnt open anywhere for a few more weeks. Check the regs where you plan to fish for bass. Staggered opening weeks depending on what lake you fish."

1080330,AKRISONER,2022-05-19 17:32:00,5558,"kayaks especially, all you need is public land like a park of some sort, not even a launch. Simple simple."
