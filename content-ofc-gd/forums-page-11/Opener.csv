Rain supposed to clear out this aft., river conditions looking like they'll be dropping back to almost prime by Saturday in my area. Enjoy, pick up after the bums where you can and don't be the guy fishing them on their redd's. Cheers. R "
1079880,BillM,2022-04-21 16:05:00,17367,Let's hope 99% of the fish are headed back to the lake.   I'll be fishing residents.
1079882,misfish,2022-04-21 17:17:00,29133,Yup. During the week for me Bill. Let me know if you want to hook up next week. 
1079891,msp,2022-04-22 00:03:00,1336,Unfortunately that won’t happen this year. It’s gonna get raped pretty bad this year
1079897,chessy,2022-04-22 15:56:00,610,yes with this colder weather its going to be a fish fest 
1079900,CrowMan,2022-04-22 20:00:00,413,"Anyone know the latest count at Corbett's on the Ganny ? For some reason I can't seem to open the Riverwatcher website anymore. Last I saw this spring it was 4800...nothing like the peak in the early 90's when the run hit 18k +, but still better than a lot of the other north shore tribs these days."
1079906,chessy,2022-04-23 17:42:00,610,the runs were never that big.....       10 to 12. but never 18 
1079907,CrowMan,2022-04-23 19:02:00,413," https://www.grca.on.ca/fisheries/ At my age, the memory is definitely going...but the GRCA also states 18 k I do remember in the late 70's and early 80's that some springs there seemed to be more fish than water...they were in that thick. There was that initial explosion in the population when they built the ladder in '74 allowing access to the headwaters spawning grounds...and of course Lake O was much more nutrient rich back then with massive populations of Alewife and Smelt."
