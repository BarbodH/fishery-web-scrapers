1079716,wkrp,2022-04-09 18:51:00,656,Boat is off its blocks and wheel bearings replaced. Bring it on
1079718,kickingfrog,2022-04-09 19:45:00,8333,Soon. I've been putting off getting mine prepped but with turkey season coming up if I don't get it done soon I'll be scrambling for pike and eyes.
1079719,LostAnotherOne,2022-04-09 20:18:00,956,Was out a few weekends ago. ¬†Only boat out there. ¬†It rained and snowed the whole time and it took me a few days to recover from that. ¬†Glad I brought my rake for the launch thou.
1079720,pics,2022-04-09 20:20:00,1268,The weather this year has not been appealing enough to get the boat out.. by this time last year I had been out a couple of times already..
1079721,porkpie,2022-04-09 21:00:00,2521,First launch for me was March 25th. ¬†I was supposed to be out a week earlier but life got in the way.
1079733,Barry Willis,2022-04-10 16:13:00,180,"I can relate, I'm chomping at the bit myself. I'm going to concentrate on lake trout as they move to shallower water once the ice is off and with that extra boost of oxygen they put the feed bag on big time."
1079734,Barry Willis,2022-04-10 16:16:00,180,"Hey Kickingfrog, I want to see at least a 7.2 walleye to equal that photo of your bass. Haha. Tight lines to all."
1079735,kickingfrog,2022-04-10 18:38:00,8333,My walleye photos all weigh more than 10lbs. lol
1079737,Barry Willis,2022-04-10 21:25:00,180,"Speaking of 10lbs. I'm kicking myself in the butt for not taking up my Dad's hunting and fishing buddy's offer. He had his hunting and fishing camp, he called it, but it looked more like a lodge on Manitoulin Island. He told me, and this was just steps from the door in his harbor, for every walleye I caught over 10lbs. he would give me 25 cents, for everyone I caught under 10lbs. he would give me ten dollars. Sure wish I'd went. My Dad was actually born¬† (in 1919) and raised in Little Current. He said back then you could walk down main street with a 30lb. northern or 6lb smallmouth and no one would pay any attention to it as most everyone caught them that size."
1079738,BillM,2022-04-10 23:10:00,17367,Mar 14th for me.¬† ¬†Had to bust up a lot of ice at the ramp.. 
1079743,petersaban,2022-04-11 11:06:00,1," You catch any cats LostAnotherOne? We were out in the area for a few hrs on friday just to run the boat. We boated 4 cats, no giants though  "
1079745,AKRISONER,2022-04-11 12:31:00,5558,"Last year March 25th we had a bit of a warm kick that lined up with a Friday I believe. this year I‚Äôm sitting and waiting patiently, and I‚Äôm dying cause I‚Äôve reconfigured the boat set up and want to test it out. Unfortunately obligations this time of year trump the boat. a good quote I heard once is the off-season is when I save my marriage üòÇ Originally the forecast for this week looked super promising, and it still kinda is for down here but up north it really ‚Äúcooled off‚Äù especially for this weekend the forecast is now +1 and snowing for Saturday. looks like the boats not getting out until the 23rd ish at the earliest me thinks, may even be the may 1 weekend!"
1079746,LostAnotherOne,2022-04-11 13:46:00,956,Just 1 in 6hrs. ¬†It was a stinker.
1079747,Dara,2022-04-11 14:01:00,3052,Still 3 feet of ice here. Boat is in storage for a while yet
