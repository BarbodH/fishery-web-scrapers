1079754,kickingfrog,2022-04-11 18:32:00,8333,Tiffin boat launch today (April 11) at lunch. Some open spots over by the government dock as well. Looked to be “lots” of ice farther out in the bay.   
1079767,kickingfrog,2022-04-12 18:52:00,8333,Not much wind but the ice has blown out a bit today.  
1079768,misfish,2022-04-12 19:09:00,29133,Some warmer days and will get me some perches. 
1079772,Fisherman,2022-04-12 20:41:00,7201,"Was there around lunch today waiting for the wifes doc visit,  the ice wasn't quite out to Minets Point yet.  Couple more days, rain and a bit of wind will kill it.  The water level looked pretty high along the Tiffin launch."
1079774,misfish,2022-04-12 21:04:00,29133,"You seen me saying ,perches didnt you? LOL "
1079797,kickingfrog,2022-04-13 18:58:00,8333,Thunder storms last night must have had some wind too. Bay looks mostly open with frazil ice pushed to the bottom of the bay.   
1079798,misfish,2022-04-13 19:34:00,29133,"I have a floater suit and spud,I,ll go check it out. LOL "
1079799,misfish,2022-04-13 19:36:00,29133,"On a side note Rob. Those exerciser things are awesome. When my sciatic starts up,I go down early morning and give,r a work out. Of course,I wipe everything down. Amazing machines. The ones over by the catcher ,are the best."
