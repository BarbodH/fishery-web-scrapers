1080236,irishfield,2022-05-14 22:36:00,26272,You need either a card or a renters check list filled out and signed by the renting outfit. Note that many lodges and resorts will no longer do the renters check list due to the liability it alludes to. I can state 100% that you need a boaters card at Manitoulin Resort.
