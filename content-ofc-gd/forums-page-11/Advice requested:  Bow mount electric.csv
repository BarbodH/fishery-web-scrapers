1075033,Sinker,2021-07-21 16:26:00,8692,"I have a 16ft tiller, deep and wide, with a 40 on it. I use a 55lb powerdrive V2 with ipilot link, Bluetooth, and universal sonar. I don't use half the features, but the spot lock and autopilot is more than worth it. Trolling has never been easier, and totally hands free, its AMAZING. I haven't touched my anchor in....well....forever. The spot lock works amazing, I use it every single time out. If I was you, I'd go with the terrova though. You can then use the hand control, AND the foot control from anywhere in the boat at any time. With the power drive, I can only do one or the other, and the foot pedal doesn't have the ipilot features built into it. It actually doesn't even come with a foot pedal, I had to buy one separate, and its still new in the package. I will say though, it takes  a bit of time to get used to the hand control. At first I hated it, because, like you, I am used to a foot pedal, but I""m getting there now. If I'm cruising a shoreline casting, I still prefer the footpedal though. The auto deploy units are sweet, but they do have a lot of issues.  More than I'm willing to take a chance on, personally. I like to keep it simple, but effective, and that's exactly what the terrova is. If you want to go bigger than 55lb you are into 24V, 70lb powerdrive, or 80lb terrova, but unless you have a very big 16ft tiller, you won't need it. I have had a 55lb on my boat for over 20 years, and unless its stupid windy, you won't need it. If its that windy, you won't be out using it anyways. I have every trolling speed covered between my bowmount, and my 40 yamaha, and battery life is amazing. My last 55lb powerdrive I used 2 31 size batteries, but this new one I've only installed one, and its been great, never killed it yet. What kind of boat are you looking at getting? Just curious.  S. "
1075035,akaShag,2021-07-21 18:19:00,2073,"Right now I am leaving my options open.  The lad on here who was looking at Lund and Crestliner got me to thinking.  I like the Lund hull and layout, but I am still looking around.  My favourite hull from years gone by was the Sylvan Super Snapper, which was what I bought and still own many moons later.  I would also consider a made-in-Canada Princecraft.  But there are no boats to be had right now, so a fellow is looking at ordering something for 2022. Thanks for your insights.  One of these years I am going to meet you, seems we have a few things in common. Doug"
1075039,Sinker,2021-07-21 19:01:00,8692,"Yep, quite a few things in common. If your like me, and don't need fancy schmancy to catch fish, look at the starcraft freedom series. They are solid, and very versatile hulls. If you want more fancy, check the alumacrafts. They are sweet. I am torn, because i am a tiller guy to the bones, but i need a bigger boat, mostly for great lakes trolling, so do I get a big tiller like I want? Or do I get a windshield for me? For the passengers? I just don't know. I sure do love my buddies alumacraft competitor 185 with a 90 yammy tiller though. She's sweet!  I've also head of a company called TEAM boats (I think, out of Bala?) that make all welded hulls. Similar to a Stanley style boat. S. S."
1075042,AKRISONER,2021-07-21 19:45:00,5558,starcraft is now basically a smoker craft...and if my experience with a smoker is worth anything...stay the heck away. Hands down the worst riding boat I have ever been in.  My old man runs an alumacraft trophy 185 and my best friend has a 17 foot crestliner...both are fantastic boats. The alumacraft specifically feels a heck of a lot like a lund. Which is saying a lot because you already know how a lund looks and feels.
1075064,porkpie,2021-07-22 15:19:00,2521,"I'd look at these.  I almost considered selling my superfisherman and getting the Freedom 18.  It's a hella nice rig for a mid size semi utility, and I sometimes miss the tiller layout.  last I checked Marsh's marine had a 16 in stock.  Might be gone now."
1075075,Sinker,2021-07-23 14:42:00,8692,"A pet peeve of mine is when people talk about things they have no idea about. Have you ever set foot in a starcraft? How about a brand new one? Smokecraft and starcraft are not the same hulls. Kind of like comparing a legend to a lund.  If you knew much about starcrafts, you would know they have a HUGE following, and last for generations. Hop in a new super fisherman and tell me about the ride. Blindfolded you would not be able to tell the difference from a Lund or Alumacraft. Talk to some big water guys with starcrafts and see what they think. Yes, I am biased because i have a starcraft, but I've also been running boats since I was 6 years old, and from one coast to the other, in every size, shape and configuration there is, and for the life of me, can't figure where you come up with a smokercraft is the worst riding boat ever. Maybe the one model you were in was a bad design? Maybe the operator? Maybe just a bad day out in it? I don't get it. Its a very bold statement to make. S. S."
1075077,AKRISONER,2021-07-23 15:03:00,5558,"I own a star craft 🤷‍♂️ My best friend/tournament partner/fishing partner got rid of his 15 year old smoker, it was sinking, multiple failed rivets, felt like a car wreck with every ripple of water it touched. He never “beached it” or ever hit anything in it. he’s in a similar size/model crest liner now, the difference is astonishing i can assure you, neither the Starcraft or the smoker feels anything like the alumacraft I own.  Or the Lund my uncle owns."
1075094,Sinker,2021-07-24 19:07:00,8692,"Comparing tin cans to actual boats is apples and oranges. A 16ft aluminum boat comes in many, many, many, shapes and sizes, and rides for that matter."

1079342,akaShag,2022-03-23 01:21:00,2073,"well...............it looks like I will be buying a Terrova 55 lb (12 volt) model with I-Pilot and a foot pedal.  The new ride is a 16 foot Alumacraft with a 40 hp Yamaha.  The hull is rated for 50 hp but there is a new 40 on it and no chance to swap for a 50. Thanks for all the advice, folks!  Next question is a ""fish finder"" and I will start a new topic for that. Doug "
1079349,AKRISONER,2022-03-23 02:22:00,5558,"Congrats, you are going to love the alumacraft. They are really solid built boats. They feel like a tank on the water. if I wasn’t in a glass boat, I’d own an alumacraft myself. I still use my old man’s trophy 185 regularly and love it, just not as much as my glasser"
1079436,Sinker,2022-03-25 14:57:00,8692,"Get a second battery if you have the space. I run 2, 31 DC on mine and it will run forever. I do a lot of slow trolling with mine though, so if you are just positioning the boat, one battery should be ok. Get the biggest one you can though. S."
1079449,Fisherman,2022-03-25 17:15:00,7201,"You're going to like that Yama 40 a lot, really quiet and fires up on first try.  Does it have the electronic idle control?  Another feature that makes trolling pretty precise."
1079460,akaShag,2022-03-25 21:07:00,2073,"I have no idea what it has, but it DOES have power tilt!  And I know a lot of fellows whose opinions I trust, who love their Yamaha outboards.  YOU are one of those people!  😉"
1079874,akaShag,2022-04-20 23:51:00,2073,"So I did buy the Minnkota Terrova 12v with a foot pedal and remote control.  So if you see a bearded old fart on a Kingston area lake cursing at his bow-mount electric, and the gizmos, that will be me!  😉"

1074947,akaShag,2021-07-19 21:27:00,2073,"This has no doubt come up before but a search did not help me, and who knows, there are probably new products out there.  I am pretty much convinced I am going to buy a new fishing boat, 16 foot aluminum, tiller, with a raised casting platform on the bow.  I want to get a bow mount electric that doesn't wreck my back each time I deploy and stow it.  (I acknowledge that I am not the young man I once was...).  I am very comfortable with a foot pedal control, and would only use the motor from a SEATED position, never standing, never on one of those 3/4 height bicycle seats that are designed to torture old guys, thanks very much. I assume that a new boat will be able to accommodate two 12 v batteries for the motor, independent of the starting battery.  I am not in any sense a competitive angler, and a LONG day in the boat for me would be 6 hours.  I am certain I don't need a 36 volt motor.  I don't fish big water any more, and the weight of the boat doesn't need that much power.  (If it is really windy, I will not be fishing, so need not worry about boat control in big swells or with a side wind.) So what do you guys recommend? I have run Minnkota electric motors for forty years or so, but would consider another brand.  The critical thing is ease of deploying and stowing it. Thanks for any advice. Doug"
1074948,Garnet,2021-07-19 21:50:00,2056,"Minn Kota makes a self deploy , the price will likely shock you. And spot lock is incredible. I've stayed with the cable steer so far. But spot lock models so popular there's many good deals on used cable steer . ! would suggest 80 Fortrex 50 inch shaft."
1074952,Freshtrax,2021-07-20 02:53:00,2215,We have the auto deploy... worth every penny.  Especialy in the rough stuff. I can deploy and spot lock from the helm.    19.5 ft aluminum  we run 24 v and never run it down in a day. Running crown floor sweeper batteries.

1074961,Freshtrax,2021-07-20 12:55:00,2215,Ulterra with I pilot link.  Had it for 3 years no issues so far.
1074963,akaShag,2021-07-20 13:04:00,2073,Thanks very much. Looks like about four grand?  What's the difference between i-pilot and i-pilot link? Doug
1074964,Terry,2021-07-20 13:29:00,14456,At 4 grand I would also look at the garmin force trolling motor.  Best on batteries by far
1074965,RickOnt,2021-07-20 13:30:00,669,I  have a Terrova with spot lock and i pilot. 24 volt and 80 lbs thrust I would recommend The newer ones have lift assist not self deploy but it is easy. I have a foot pedal but mainly use the remote. I use spot lock a lot avoid the anchor and rope i pilot is for GPS heading and i pilot link will hook up to a Humminbird and follow a contour 
1074966,akaShag,2021-07-20 13:38:00,2073,"Looks like about $2600 on-line. In relatively calm conditions, how much battery is burned using spot lock?  I can see that being a very useful feature for fishing crappies (where I would usually anchor) I am appreciating all the advice guys, please keep it coming.

1074967,Garnet,2021-07-20 14:09:00,2056,Game changer
1074968,RickOnt,2021-07-20 14:13:00,669,Spot lock does not use much power I have never used more than half in any amount of wind. As Garnet says a game changer for sure
1074970,akaShag,2021-07-20 14:41:00,2073,"So it looks like I want spot lock or a similar feature, we are making good progress here and thanks! Doug"
1074976,porkpie,2021-07-20 16:16:00,2521,"The spot lock uses very little battery unless it’s very windy.  Another thing you’ll like is the autopilot feature.  It will change your world if you like to troll.  I’ve heard of some occasional problems with the self deploy, but I sure think I’d take my chances if I needed a new motor and it was in the budget.  Talk about a nice feature to have!"
1074980,Freshtrax,2021-07-20 17:30:00,2215,We got a good deal about 3 k 3 Years ago. The link feature integrates the sonar and the motor more.  Allows you to follow lake contours... ie.  I can tell the motor to keep me in 14 ft of water and follow the shoreline at whatever mph I tell it. Allows for more saved tracks and waypoints.   Has a nicer remote.  I'm sure it does more but I haven't taken the time to learn it.  Biggest features for me are spotlock. Spot lock jog ( move in 5 ft increments in any direction while spotlocked)   Auto pilot.   I use it when drifting to keep my heading down on st Clair River as well as slow the drift.    Also use auto pilot on erie and lake o trolling.  We use the kicker for thrust and I set a heading on the hummingbird can dile in exact speed  and heading and not have to have my hands on the wheel all day I actualy bungee the steering wheel straight.  Complete gamecganger.   Let's me fish instead of drive the boat all day.
1074982,AKRISONER,2021-07-20 18:56:00,5558,"to date I have owned A motorguide Tour cable drive minkotta powerdrive v1 Minkotta Powerdrive V2 ipilot A minkotta Terrova Gen 1 ipilot minkotta terrova gen 2 ipilot Garmin Force and I have multiple close friends and first hand dealings with Minkotta Fortrex Minkotta Ultrex  For your type of fishing I would most highly recommend a Minkotta Terrova gen 2 with ipilot (non link) or if you want to get crazy a Garmin Force (totally dependant on your boat...please remind of me of what kind of boat you are running...this is a very very heavy robust motor that I would not suggest for any aluminum boat under 18 feet long. Having experience with all of these motors, Minkotta has very much disappointed me hence my move to garmin this year. Out of all of those motors, only 3 have operated without signficant issues/are now dead. The Foretrex The Terrova V2 ipilot and the garmin force are the only motors that have worked to expectations with the Garmin Force being literally on another planet as far as trolling motors go. You pay for it, but its by far the best trolling motor on the market (I havent used a lowrance ghost yet but my understanding is that its comparable)  That being said...i think for the type of fishing you enjoy (judging by your past reports) an 80lb thrust terrova V2 Ipilot without a link is the ideal motor for you. You dont need the link because 1. to run the link youd need a networked humminbird sonar GPS which as a whole other investment and 2. the ipilot follow contours function is based off of the use of either lakemaster or a humminbird zero lines chart card which requires you to map the lake yourself. The Lakemaster canada card simply put...is terrible. Its honestly pathetic in Canada and I would highly recommend to anyone to not bother with it. In fact its so bad I would outright consider it dangerous due to its complete lack of accuracy. Hope this helps.  "

It can get buggered up too, but its pretty darn easy to stow and deploy. The garmin force has a twin shock system that helps buffer and give you power to both stow and deploy the motor. The force is a cable drive style motor, big, powerful, and stows on a pivot vs a sliding shaft like the terrovas. They really are two totally different beasts and I think its overkill for your application."

1075001,Rattletrap2,2021-07-20 21:02:00,1652,"Doug, my first bow mount trolling motor in the 80's was a Minn Kota. The thing was a Power Drive and it was plagued with foot pedal issues, but otherwise worked great. I thin switched boats and got a Minn Kota Maxxum 65 with cable steer foot pedal. That thing was bullet proof and would plow through any weed bed with ease. It was only 12 volt but had the Maximizer technology and was easy on the battery. When I bought my new 16.5 foot tiller with 40 HP Yamaha in 2017, my Wife convinced me to go with new technology and get the Motorguide Xi5  55# with 54"" shaft & with remote control, wireless foot pedal, Anchor lock, and I can even control the thing from my graphs! So far, it is no match for the weeds like the Minn Kota was and I am on my third remote! The things just quit after a year or so. If I had to do it over, I would go back to cable steer and forego all this technology! I find the motor does the job fine on 12 volts though."
