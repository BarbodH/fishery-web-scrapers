This was my boys first time in the boat and he enjoyed it thoroughly.  	The target, big Channel Cats. Sadly the big girls didn't come out to play. We weren't fishing 5 minutes when we were into a double header, my daughter's was a Cat and mine a was Bowfin. The next 30 minutes was constant action but few fish over the gunnels. The end result for a few hours of fishing was, 1 Cat, 2 Bowfin, 1 Pumpkinseed and a scruffy Northern.        "

1080162,Spiel,2022-05-10 21:41:00,9065,"Thanks Phil. I've sadly and regrettably not been using the Lund as much as she deserves to be used, I've even toyed with selling it a few times and I've had amazing offers on it. However, my daughter Madison informed me a few years back I'm not allowed to sell it, she has laid claim to it.   	 I will concur with you whole heartedly, it is a really nice ride."
1080163,Spiel,2022-05-10 21:41:00,9065,"I should drag old Farmer up there for a day of Whities, it's been a few years since he and I were last there."
