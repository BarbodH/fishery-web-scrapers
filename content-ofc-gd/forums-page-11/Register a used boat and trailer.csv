Of what I've heard I don't need to register the boat or insure it, but I need to register the trailer. What papers do I need for that? Thanks for your feedback Rich"

You take it to Service Ontario and transfer over the ownership and get your plates for it at this point. You will also pay taxes on the trailer so be prepared for that cost. Ensure that your bill of sale has the trailer and boat separated on it. Service Ontario is going to know how much you paid for the trailer. "
