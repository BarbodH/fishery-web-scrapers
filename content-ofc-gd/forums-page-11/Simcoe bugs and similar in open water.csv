1079572,SirCranksalot,2022-04-01 22:36:00,3291," Has anybody tried them? As I understand it, they are supposed to imitate a scud/shrimp rather than a caddis. I was thinking of trying them for spring lakers and for possibly for bass. Are scuds present in most, or even all, of our lakes? From what I have read they constitute a significant percentage of the diet of many fish esp in the spring and fall when insects and their larvae are more scarce. Does anybody have a good source of info on this? TIA"
1079576,Fisherman,2022-04-02 00:10:00,7201,"I remember the first time I saw a crusty old guy named George using them in open water on a 6-7 foot rod, lower to the bottom and gently twitch and slowly reel up, twitch and reel.Â Â  He would only reel up about 3-4 feet and then open the bail and let it drop again.Â  Misfish (Brian) knows who I mean.Â  I haven't seen George in a couple years, don't know if he's still alive or not.Â Â  He used the same ones in the winter, again a 6-7 foot rod ice fishing."
1079582,misfish,2022-04-02 17:09:00,29133,"Seen him this winter, still the same ole George. I cant be bothered fishing for the whities,yet there he was. LOL I remember him 30 years ago,showing me his set up on a jigging rapala with flat fish wire hooks on the bottom. Never seen a better snagging set up. LMAO  "
1079610,SirCranksalot,2022-04-04 01:24:00,3291,Do you know how well the bugs worked for George in open water fishing? thx

1079615,misfish,2022-04-04 13:50:00,29133,Early open water and late water for perch. All winter long. I always seen him doing what FishermanÂ  said .
1079629,SirCranksalot,2022-04-04 21:33:00,3291,"OF---thx for that link. I had some good info.  Brian----both yours and the original? simcoe bug on the SI website look quite unlike those I saw on quite a few Youtube videos that I checked out. Those were quite hairy, using something they called dubbing. So I am wondering if yours are supposed to be scuds or larvae for insects such as Mayflies?"
1079630,misfish,2022-04-04 21:55:00,29133,"You got these right?   That is the take of a SB, but I will not use that name. Ice bug. This is a scud    "

1079632,SirCranksalot,2022-04-04 22:44:00,3291,"Yes, those are like mine(pic of mine below) So did you tie that scud, or did you just download the pic? What are yours supposed to imitate? thx "

1079634,SirCranksalot,2022-04-04 23:12:00,3291,"So how do you use those scuds that you tie? On the river? BTW, 'our' river has dropped quite a bit and is starting to clear up "
1079635,misfish,2022-04-04 23:20:00,29133,"They are high hook bugs. You can also fly fish them and use as a high hook over a dropper fly. Or use as a dropper under a dry. Thanks for the heads up. Would say say tomorrow would be good? I was going else where,but would sooner cover more waters. Thanks "
1079636,SirCranksalot,2022-04-05 00:28:00,3291," ""They are high hook bugs. You can also fly fish them and use as a high hook over a dropper fly. Or use as a dropper under a dry."" are you referring to the Simcoe bug or the scud pattern(hairy) fly? Re river---I am not much of a steelheader so my judgement re conds is not great. There have been no fishermen's cars parked at the 2 or 3 well known locs so far. If you look on the wateroffice website you can see that the level has dropped 1/2 m or so. The color is a bit better too. If you decide to come pls PM me so we can connect by phone.Â  Thx"
1079644,SirCranksalot,2022-04-06 01:41:00,3291,any bows today?
1079660,SirCranksalot,2022-04-07 00:39:00,3291,did you get out?

1079664,misfish,2022-04-07 12:12:00,29133,Just local. Seen the water here and saved fuel. ðŸ˜† 
1079665,SirCranksalot,2022-04-07 13:23:00,3291,looks like you were all tied up 
1079678,SirCranksalot,2022-04-08 03:31:00,3291,I' have done very little fly fishing. Are those nymphs that you fish off the bottom?  And that hairy scud----do you use that on open water or fish thru the ice like Simcoe bugs? Thx
1079679,misfish,2022-04-08 09:53:00,29133,Those bugs are for twitching under a float. Steelhead The scud is year round high hook and can be used for fly fishing.
1079705,SirCranksalot,2022-04-08 22:27:00,3291,"I saw 3 cars yesterday and today parked at a well known spot. Levels are down a bit more.  I was thinking of trying a hairy scud on a spinning rodÂ  as a high hook with a drop shot. Have you ever tried them on a lake on anything other than a fly rod?  OF---my bud and I used hellgrammites for bass a few years ago, As I recall they were OK but not outstanding. They seem to be hard to find locally now."
1079709,OhioFisherman,2022-04-09 02:31:00,6623,"Sir, the only place I have seen one was at Devils lake in Ontario 1957, a couple of youtube videos I have seen show people using them with a lot of success. I took uncle josh pork grubs and put round rubber legs on them, my top trailer for small hair jigs. These have also worked for me. https://arkielures.com/collections/plastic-lures/products/salty-crawlin-fry"
