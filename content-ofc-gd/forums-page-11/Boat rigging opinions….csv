1079642,strik,2022-04-06 00:03:00,175,Cisco  tracks are great
1079646,John Bacon,2022-04-06 03:07:00,3277,"I have contemplated it.  I thought of using some 1"" square tubing to widen the gunwale."
1079647,pics,2022-04-06 11:33:00,1268,It's doable if the holes line up with a space to put the nut and bolts underneath.. a little hanging over the edge would be ok I think..
1079654,Mr Greedydrift,2022-04-06 19:39:00,25,"Are the tracks being installed to mount downriggers? If yes, think about mounting riggers in the boat, up on those narrow gunnels they get smashed against docks and walls when tying off your boat.  "

1079689,BillM,2022-04-08 14:16:00,17367,I'm not a fan of thin gunwales.  I'd definitely mount your riggers on pedestals inside the boat.

1079736,Rustic-Fisher,2022-04-10 20:56:00,826,Thanks for the ideas! after careful thought .. I bailed on it . Figure I'll just save the $$$ and continue to feed my  new Muskie obsession lol. No riggers this year .
1079759,porkpie,2022-04-12 13:22:00,2521,"I see you’ve given up on the idea for now, but I’ll give my thoughts for next time.  I have wide gunnels and the tracks on the gunnels are great, but I have lots of area for reinforcement underneath.    	MY old boat had skinny gunnels and I mounted tracks on the decks and used pedestals.  It was a great setup, and when they weren’t in use I put the inserts in the tracks and it was a very clean install.  That’s the way I’d go if I where you."
