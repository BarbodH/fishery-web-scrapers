His name was Gary Burridge.

If i attempt to pull it to the console it doesnt budge, I cant seemingly find the other end of it anywhere else in the boat...so there it will stay i guess lol Ive got a decent spool of used marine 8 guage wire now that I have no clue what I am going to do with lol.

I remember trying tape a few times and all that happened was the tape got caught while running the wire lol. Ive learned as stated, If you have a job to do, just plan for an entirely new install and rip everything out that you possible can. Non marine wire, non tinned copper terminal ends, merrets, electrical tape, wrong sized fuses (this one is scary) I’ve seen it all and it’s not like I do this professionally. to date scariest thing that’s happened to me and I had a whole thread about it a few years back was the crappy stock minkotta plug receptacle vibrating my wire and cutting it to the point that it down guaged built resistance and lit on fire without me knowing it. to this day I still have no clue why a fuse didn’t blow or my boat didn’t light on fire. So lucky. unrelated and on a terrifying note, went to the car wash today and was taking off the bib off my truck and found a whole mouse nest on top of my friggin battery! My truck was a friggin tinder box and I didn’t even know it. Blew out the nest and sprayed pesticide all over the battery cover, hopefully that will deter the little bugger from returning!"

1062066,AKRISONER,2020-05-20 01:17:00,5558,"Hey guys, just an update on this and to spread some knowledge at the expense of my many many many far too many hours of reading... as many already know there are basically 3 battery companies that manufacture the majority of both lead acid and AGM batteries in North America. typically the quality of them is considered by ranking them in the following order east penn/deka johnson controls expride  you can throw Trojan and odyssey in the mix if you want but I would consider them to somewhat be in a total league of their own. I came to the conclusion that they were indeed out of my personal price range. $500+ tax was just a bit too much for me. After reading more and more and attempting to determine who makes what for who I finally was able to come to a conclusion of who owns what. Expride seems to have basically disappeared johnson controls makes Kirkland, energizer and optima batteries east penn/deka owns deka battery, USA battery, but within the last year and a half has now started manufacturing canadian Tire’s ultra AGM batteries. This was huge news and finally explained why the heck the nautilus AGM batteries were so bloody expensive. People have cross referenced and you’ll actually notice that the canadian tire batteries have an identical casing to deka batteries with the exact same ratings. Canadian tire now also offers an industry leading 4 year totally comprehensive replacement warranty for their ultra AGM line of batteries. And most crazy of all the specs of their smaller ultra AGM batteries actually exceeds the cranking amps and amp hour specs on larger batteries. Saving me some much needed weight and space. so the decision was made, lucky for me they actually are on sale right now too. i figured I would share this info with everyone because it saved me a few hundred bucks, got me a battery with an unparralled warranty and has some of the highest quality components in the market. good on canadian tire for stepping up and providing a quality option in the canadian market at a reasonable price. Unfortunately it seems the battery brands change hands frequently. "
1079173,Crashman,2022-03-15 21:25:00,3,"So did you buy these batteries, and how did they work?  I am in the same boat, literally!  New Alumacraft coming this spring and need batteries, I have read everything I can find on batteries, I would love to go lithium but for good quality I am looking at $2600 plus tax.  I am thinking of getting the group 31 Nautilus Extreme AGM for my cranking/house battery (three HB Helix 9s) and two of the standard Nautilus group 31 AGM for my 24volt Terrova.  I have a new Noco three bank Genius charger as well so I think that will be a good setup.  Just waiting and hoping the batteries go on sale before the first of April. I would love to hear how you made out with your battery quest!"
1079174,David Chong,2022-03-15 21:57:00,836,"Last summer, I ran Lynac Lithiums for the entire summer and cannot say enough about them! I never came remotely close to running out of juice even though we did run out of gas LOL eh ARKISONER? They charged up real quickly, I don't believe that it ever took more than about 4 hours to fully charge them each evening. If you do the math at $642 a battery and you'll probably get 10 years out of them.(They come with 7 year warranty) it makes sense to spend the extra money now and never have to worry about power. BTW I also noticed more power with my trolling motor. Anyway a great Canadian company out of Thunder Bay with great customer service!

That’s my only reason for not making the change over. i ran the standard nautilus group 31’s for my trolling motor and didn’t ever even come close to draining them. I did a 13 hour day last year pre fishing a tournament in heavy wind and they still had half their juice left at the end of the day. I’ve always been more concerned with my electronics. That day I ran two Garmin 95s, a helix 7 and livescope for 13 hours straight and didn’t kill a nautilus group 27 extreme never mind the 31!"

AGM batteries do not like being charged at much more then 2 amps. That's mostly due to the heat that's generated during the charging process; these batteries cannot handle the relatively high internal temps of higher charging rates. A proper AGM charger has the technology to closely monitor the battery temp. It does this by using the voltage and amperage applied to the battery to calculate the temp and then adjust the charge rate. When the battery(s) are fully charged the charger will go into a float mode; as to keep the battery fully charged and not too over charge. Dan.  "

AGM requires lower charge voltages shouldn't exceed 14.4vts or you may get reduced life span 
1059861,Garnet,2020-04-15 11:46:00,2056,"For all battery's it's cycles how many times you discharge and charge. To be good to your battery you would re charge after 25% use. Rec fishermen might do this. Tournament guys do everything possible to kill battery's, they discharge to near zero everyday on the water blast them over night and do it again 7 days a week . 2 seasons is what I got from battery's but I also perch/crappie fish and a crazy walleye guy spring and fall. I also only added water once and would buy all new battery's. Most of the time I gave them to rec fishermen and they got years out of them, for me not worth the risk.

1059890,AKRISONER,2020-04-15 16:41:00,5558,I definitely put mine to work during boating season. Aside from the super extreme tournament guys its safe to say i put over 350 hours on them over the period between June and October.

What i did do was get the guy on acid tanks to get me some. This was late July and thought get threw season buy battery's come spring. What happened was fishing a tournament on Rice 3 weeks after filling battery's 9 am and dead battery's. I'm at Harris with credit card in hand buying 2 battery's 27 group to get threw day. I cashed a check and sold the battery's without losing to much. So after that would fill battery's with boiled water and get threw a weekend and then buy the right battery's for the job. This was about 92,93 I bought a load tester and learned how to use it. Pre internet for me."

Coil up (In 8-10"" loops) 10 feet of copper tubing; the same size as the cooker's spigot. Connect the coil to the spigot with a short section of hose and a couple of hose clamps. Hang the coil vertically with a downwards slop (Maybe 10-15°); with the other end of coil stuck inside an open container. Fill the cooker half way with tap water, put the lid on and then put the cooker on the heat to boil. You'll now have distilled water. Also if you're inclined; you can start making your own screech.

But before I go and drop close to $500 on a new AGM id like to hear you guys out on your opinion for the best batteries? I think ive made the decision to switch to AGM this time around because its become obvious that riding my small bassboat on the great lakes is causing too much spilling. Its noticeable every year when I go to fill them in the spring with some new water. Ive also been intrigued by the Nautilus Ultra XD Group 24 AGM, however I am seeing conflicting information on their website about the warranty on the battery. It says 3 years in the description and then 4 in the warranty section. Also ive read some bad reviews, but they seem to all be from 8+ years ago. My most recent visit to crappy can, it seems like they have re-branded their batteries. I look at an optima, however word is that their manufacturing changed as has their warranty recently. Seems like the company changed hands and quality has declined significantly. I personally had this experience with their red tops dying in my car after 2 years...but that was 10+ years ago. Maybe things have gotten better. Ive looked at Odysee, I dont know anything about them, but they seem legit. The challenge im having with them is finding where the heck to buy them? and finally Im heavily leaning to going with an interstate 34m-AGM but what are you guys running? I havent bought a marine battery in my entire life aside from the costco lead acid deep cycles. But im totally open and all ears. Im not very concerned with pricing if Im assured that the battery is going to last 10 years. I baby my batteries, and my boat goes right back on the charger every time i dock it. So they should last fairly long. Most ""reviews"" on line seem to be paid for by the respective manufacturer. So id rather ask a bunch of guys that actually run batteries to give me their 2 cents. Let me know what you guys think! **Side note** I wish I could afford to go lithium, but reading up on it, going lithium would also require a new charger for the boat as well. Maybe some day. "
1059220,aplumma,2020-04-08 16:23:00,6896,If you are using the battery and then charging it like you should then you can continue using your lead acid ones. I switched to AGM optima batteries in all of my boats and some are 7 years old now. I fish in some places where I can not plug in at the end of the day so I went with the AGM. I also do not like the acid venting in the battery compartments and while the AGM also vents it is much less and will not spill if it is cracked or tipped. Art 
1059221,Yellow Fever,2020-04-08 16:26:00,139,"So...its a starting battery.? And you want a group 24? What are you powering?  I run a Trojan ST 1000 for the last 4 years and it has been a good battery, it starts a 250 and powers all my electronics ( 4 different units and downriggers ) now my kicker is a 15 with high power charging so it never really gets down.

1059222,DRIFTER_016,2020-04-08 16:28:00,10439,I put a Canadian Tire AGM battery in my Honda Pilot two years ago and will never use a flooded battery again. They work way better in the cold than flooded and no spillage or off gassing. I need to replace my TM batteries and they will be AGM. I'm also planning on using AGM's in my solar power system out at the cabin.
1059223,AKRISONER,2020-04-08 16:33:00,5558,"Motor, all of my electronics plus my livewells on tournament days. Theres really no such thing as a ""dual purpose"" AGM as they are basically implied  as dual purpose when you buy a marine AGM, at least from what I can see so far? Ive been looking at the specs on the batteries and surprisingly the Canadian Tire battery has the same specs as the interstate. 1000MCA and 800 CCA with a comparable reserve capacity. I worry about longevity with the Canadian Tire batteries though."
1059224,porkpie,2020-04-08 16:37:00,2521,"I’ve had terrible luck with nautilus batteries.  Average luck with Costco batteries.  Walmart has been ok so far.  I have 2 optima blue top for the TM in my big boat.  They came with it, I wouldn’t have bought them but so far they are holding strong at 4 years old.  I have used lead acids on the Great Lakes for ages and taken a pounding and never had a problem.  If I where to buy standard batteries I’d buy 2 of the 29’s they sell at Walmart.  I have one that’s 6 years old and works perfectly for the tinner and used it on my old 16 footer for several years on the bow mount.  It took a beating and still holds a charge and lasts a long time.  JMO"
1059225,Fisherman,2020-04-08 18:03:00,7201,"I've always been of the opinion that Optima batteries are priced like Sears, way out of this universe."
1059226,AKRISONER,2020-04-08 18:07:00,5558,Crazy enough...the optima is cheaper than the canadian tire ultra agms at Costco
1059227,Fisherman,2020-04-08 18:11:00,7201,"Is that comparing the same group size and amps.  If I was going to go AGM, I would probably go with either DEKA or Oddysey.  They seem to have much better reviews."
1059228,AKRISONER,2020-04-08 18:16:00,5558,"It’s a group 27 instead of 24, but is basically the same thing. i agree with you in what I’m reading in reviews as well hence the hesitation. I’m also struggling to find anyone that carries odyssey marine AGM’s. Walmart sells all of their car batteries."
1059230,grimsbylander,2020-04-08 18:37:00,3016,Maybe I missed it...how many batteries are in your boat and exactly how are they being used? I’m assuming if you have a 24V system for your troller you have 3 batteries on board.
1059231,AKRISONER,2020-04-08 18:40:00,5558,"3! 2 for the TM and 1 for everything else, starting, livewells, electronics. I wish I could have another but it’s a small boat and my compartment is already full."
1059232,grimsbylander,2020-04-08 19:25:00,3016,"That’s perfect and 24v is good for a boat your size. 👍🏻 AGM batteries are great from a maintenance standpoint just don’t expect any more life or performance over a good wet cell. Meaning, they may perform better but the way to fish you may never realize it. If I was fishing for cash every weekend and ran electronics and live wells from 7am to 3pm, and still needed to turn over a V6, I’d spend the extra dough. I’d be wary of models of AGM that are priced the same or less than wet cell.  	Imho"
1059234,Yellow Fever,2020-04-08 20:15:00,139,I would seriously not consider anything other than a series 31.....is there such a thing as to much battery?
1059238,grimsbylander,2020-04-08 21:14:00,3016,"Yes. Buying more battery than you need will cost more but more importantly, the weight is the issue. His boat needs to run on the pad to perform properly. Weight and balance can affect getting up on plane and top speed."
1059243,AKRISONER,2020-04-08 22:09:00,5558,I also don’t have any more space to fit it! compartment is tight as it is! Older photo but the same batteries. Would be tough to fit a group 31.  would love to go lithium and save myself 100lbs but the price is still too high 
1059244,grimsbylander,2020-04-08 22:13:00,3016,I like your wiring schematic on the lid 😁
1059245,AKRISONER,2020-04-08 22:16:00,5558,"Lol it’s probably wrong. It’s from the previous owner, he clearly didn’t know anything about wiring or electronics. Hence the entire re-wire of most things in my boat that aren’t OEM. guy was running the TM on 12 guage and the electronics in the boat on 16. Everything taped or merretted together too."
1059248,Yellow Fever,2020-04-08 22:21:00,139,Well thats a tight fit
1059252,Terry,2020-04-08 23:06:00,14456,Yeah wiring schematic is wrong sure is tight in there
1059256,captpierre,2020-04-08 23:37:00,2521,"Can’t believe my Deka lead acid starting battery , that came with the Lund in 2009,  is still going strong."
1059257,Crimsongulf,2020-04-08 23:46:00,294,I have had no luck with Optima batteries.   your mileage may vary.
1059258,Yellow Fever,2020-04-08 23:56:00,139,"Terry...It's not wrong for 24 volts. I do a bit of boat wiring and can't believe some of the things i see on boats, critical wires wrapped together then held together with 1/2 a roll of vinyl tape."
1059259,BillM,2020-04-08 23:57:00,17367,"Optima used to be good, 15 years ago.  Now?  Not even close.   Go to Total Battery, get some Group 31 AGMs and be done with it."
1059261,Crimsongulf,2020-04-09 00:26:00,294,Remember there are dozens of battery brands but only about 6 actual manufacturers.
