1080217,Spiel,2022-05-13 18:34:00,9065,Can anyone point me to an Southern Ontario source to purchase something like this? 	I'm getting to old to climb down off the bow to the trailer tongue.  😁

1080225,misfish,2022-05-14 00:10:00,29133,LOL  I am laughing with you not at you.
1080227,Fisherman,2022-05-14 00:39:00,7201,"I can relate to this dilemma, about 25 years ago I used to go fish with an old codger,  poor bugger bad bad close up vision, used to tie his hooks, make him climb out on the boulders at Thornbury to surf cast, etc,  now I look back and say I must have been a mean bugger to make him do that."
