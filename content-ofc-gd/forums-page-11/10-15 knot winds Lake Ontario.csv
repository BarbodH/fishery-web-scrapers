From experience on Lake Erie out of Port‚Äôs ¬†Stanley & Bruce you go out approximately 5 miles before a offshore wind churns things up. I‚Äôm guessing a South wind 15-20 knot‚Äôs with a wave forecast of 1‚Äô-2‚Äô waves if putting in at Port Dalhousie probably wouldn‚Äôt cause too much chop in the current depth the bite would be at. With lake of knowledge, I‚Äôm guessing at present the majority of fishing is not too far off shore. Looking to be educated üòÄthanks Sea Ray Lew"

1080289,Rizzo,2022-05-17 11:11:00,4754,"I fished that area last year for the first time. We were probably 1-3 miles off shore if I remember correctly. South or west wind should be good over there but a north or east not so good. I only have a 16'8"" boat and I don't remember any white knuckle experiences over there"
1080290,Rizzo,2022-05-17 11:16:00,4754,"What does ""sheep and goiters"" mean? Gonna assume the sheep part is whitecaps??"
1080291,dave524,2022-05-17 11:18:00,4508,"I can see the lake from the end of my driveway in Grimsby, lived here since '84, don't even consider it on a Northerly wind. As I posted a few minutes ago Martin from Grimsby Tackle usually posts a south shore water report in the morning on facebook, he lives on the shore near Beamsville"
1080292,dave524,2022-05-17 11:19:00,4508,Goiters is large swells I think
1080293,Rizzo,2022-05-17 11:20:00,4754,"ya...just googled it! Sounds about right. ""Whitecaps and big swells"""
1080295,Sea Ray Lew,2022-05-17 12:49:00,8,"Thanks for all the info, dave524 & Rizzo . All very helpful info, It‚Äôs much appreciated üëç"
1080296,Raycaster,2022-05-17 13:28:00,528,"Ok, if your wondering about weather/waves I found this great reply off another site that I follow. I only have a small 16‚Äô so weather is VERY important to me. I would give credit to the original poster but dont have it. Here is a screen shot of the post.  "
1080297,dave524,2022-05-17 14:08:00,4508,"The big swells after a good blow alone are fishable even in smaller craft, it's when they get topped by an opposite direction wind things get hairy"
1080299,misfish,2022-05-17 16:26:00,29133,"Lucky for me here,I can pick spots to fish. North and south,east and west winds. Advantages of having a float boat.¬† For now anyways.LOL"
