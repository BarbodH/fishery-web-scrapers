1079993,BillM,2022-04-30 15:39:00,17367,Google is showing a bunch of reviews.  Probably a good place to start.   Make sure you make a trip report when you get back!
1080079,bigugli,2022-05-06 16:36:00,6138,Was there a few years back. 2014 to be exact. A few posts about Biscotasi. Brian is a good host. Fishing was good. Take a guide on the first day. It pays off big.  Only point of supply is the General Store at the landing. Make sure you get gas at the corner before you pull onto the Sultan rd.  And some sections of the timber road can get rough.

1080083,Meely,2022-05-06 22:35:00,282,"……. and when you are with that guide, make sure you bring a portable GPS and track all your movements. Will prove invaluable the following days. If you want to go back and revisit spots, you will need it. Trust me. You can get lost lickity-split."
