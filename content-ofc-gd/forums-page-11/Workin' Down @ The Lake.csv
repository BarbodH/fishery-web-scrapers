1079855,DRIFTER_016,2022-04-20 00:21:00,10439,Happy Easter Bill. Got a little pine installed over the past couple of days. More importantly I got my rear surround speakers installed. Almost up to the vaulted ceiling now. Back to work tomorrow. How many days until the weekend? 😁    
1079857,akaShag,2022-04-20 00:52:00,2073,This build will rival the Pyramids!!!!! And I do hope to see it with my own eyes one of these years............. Doug
1079860,DRIFTER_016,2022-04-20 01:10:00,10439,"NAH, they built the pyramids faster!!!! 😜"
1076406,akaShag,2021-10-03 23:30:00,2073,"Dave, this just gets awesomer and awesomer...................😉 Hope you get a bit of time to soak a lure for the lakers.  With the fall coming on full force, they must be on the feed bag big time! Doug"
1076407,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-04 00:16:00,10439,Doug I wanted to get out this afternoon but couldn't be bothered to buck the waves so just went home. Hopefully I'll get a day or two before ice up. Lake was 48 degrees today.
1076408,akaShag,2021-10-04 00:24:00,2073,"Pretty soon you'll see the lake turn over?  Like I said, I hope you get a chance to soak some lures for the greys!  	Doug"
1076431,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-04 16:05:00,10439,"Forgot to mention that this year has been brutal for bears up here. There have been 3 shot in town, a momma with twins relocated and a momma with cub they are trying to catch. There was a momma with cub wrecking peoples stuff on my lake and a 2 year old causing havoc and breaking into cabins. He tried to break into mine 3 times while I was sleeping in it!!! The first two I didn't have my gun and the third I blasted a warning shot over his head as he ran away. He got into my neighbours cabin 2 doors down and trashed it, don't know if he got into Dave's cabin beside me or not. Got to buy a tag so I can thin the herd.  I could use a nice bear rug anyway. 😁 The one that was trying to get into my place I would have dropped if I had a shot then just called ENR to come and collect it. I talked to them previously and they said do what you have to and give us a call for removal. My neighbour across the bay from me is a wildlife officer too. He had issues with the same bear and the momma with cub."
1076432,akaShag,2021-10-04 16:08:00,2073,"I don't believe I would be up in the woods WITHOUT packing some kind of heat.  Probably a 12 ga, first round 00 Buck, next two slugs.  And no warning shots...."
1076433,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-04 16:14:00,10439,They have always been around but this is the first time they have been a pain. Other than one time years ago when one ripped open my tent had a look around and left while I was away on business. The 870 is loaded with Remington slugs. I forgot to load it when I went to the cabin on my vacation so when I cam into town for supplies I picked it up. At some point the darn thing scratched my dining room window on the porch. Their paws must be like 40 grit sandpaper!! Would hate to get swatted by one. The second time he showed up I banged on the door and he just walked over and stood on his hind legs. We were about 12 inches apart separated by the entry door. He beat feet when I banged on a pot with my BBQ tongs.
1076434,akaShag,2021-10-04 16:22:00,2073,"Yep, good skookum medicine, 12 gauge slugs.  I always figured my first round would be double aught buck for a shot to the head, hoping to take out the eyes and maybe get lucky with a brain hit, then 2 slugs to the boiler room.  When we camped out on Great Slave East Arm a few years back, the 870 Marine Magnum was beside us in the tent............"
1076460,BassMan11,2021-10-06 14:03:00,583,Yikes Dave... those are the types of Bears that unfortunately need to be taken care of. They will always be around. Great progress on the Cabin as usual.  Cheers
1076608,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-13 00:16:00,10439,Spent the Thanksgiving weekend at the cabin and was the only person at my end of the lake all weekend. It was so nice and quiet. 😁 Spent my time peeling logs that I cut in the spring. Started running low on time so only quick stripped a bunch of them. The big one was peeled in the spring. It's got really cool spiral checking now.  Also pulled the dock out on Monday and closed up the cabin until safe ice. This morning there was snow on the ground.
1076611,BillM,2021-10-13 03:33:00,17367,"Dave, that place is just unreal.  I love these updates!   You getting Starlink up there for internet?"
1076612,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-13 03:44:00,10439,"Put my $$$$ down in the spring. Just waiting for 2022. Gotta see if I can get a couple of extra antenna wire kits so I can move the system around. Would like to use it at the cabin, house and camper."
1076613,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-13 03:51:00,10439,Forgot to mention I went for a swim while pulling the dock. Of course it happened early in the job so I had to work wet for an hour or so in air temps just above freezing.  🙄 The granite is as slick as goose turds. Luckily the water is still a balmy 44F. 😎
1076614,AKRISONER,2021-10-13 12:00:00,5558,"Dave the thing I’m most shocked about is that after following this thread along is that there is actually an open water season 😂  yet here we are talking about ice up out of all of the cottage jobs, dock work is my most hated bar none. It always needs to be done when it’s cold as hell. There’s not a heck of a lot of august dock work."
1076620,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-13 17:25:00,10439,I wish I could put in a pier using those big interlocking Lego brick like concrete blocks and back fill the middle with rocks and dirt. Then just tie up to that and never worry about dock removal again.
1076630,HTHM,2021-10-13 23:23:00,4082,"Ask for forgiveness, not permission....😈"
1076631,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-14 00:20:00,10439,It's more about the $$$$ than the two government agencies I'll have to 'splain myself to.
1076656,Dara,2021-10-15 12:23:00,3052,That spiral one is pretty nice. Musta been a job getting it up the steps and into the cabin🙂
1076663,BillM,2021-10-15 17:33:00,17367,"If you're all within the same cell you might be able to move it around.  Camper might be tough if you're in Alaska, but I'm sure that feature is coming."

1076710,pics,2021-10-19 12:27:00,1268,I see those spiral logs often when I'm in the Greenstone area. There are different theories of why they grow that way but log cabin builders seem to favour the right hand spiral.. they must be a whine to split for firewood..
1076711,akaShag,2021-10-19 12:31:00,2073,I bet the original word rhymed with witch and started with the letter b....   😉

1079832,DRIFTER_016,2022-04-17 00:27:00,10439,Taking a break to chill @ the bush crib. Put the SxS to work hauling pellets up from the lake for the stove. Can haul 30 bags at a time. 😁    Life is better at the cabin.  Don't have to head back to town until Tuesday evening. Happy Easter y'all!!!!
1072294,akaShag,2021-04-20 12:39:00,2073,My back hurts just LOOKING at those bundles!  😮 Doug

Please don't stop posting you're advancements towards the end of you're build. Thanks for sharing this adventure with us. A dream of mine that may never happen; but I can enjoy watching yours's come true. All the best!!!!! Dan.
1072347,Dara,2021-04-20 22:52:00,3052,I actually got lucky enough to see the place in person a year and a half ago. Cleaned lake trout on the dock. The ones we caught out front 🙂 It is way more amazing in person than on here. Unbelievable what he has done and where on his own. What paneling did you get. Can't wait to see it

1073204,woodenboater,2021-05-12 01:02:00,2277,I WANT ONE !!!!! 
1073219,Cast-Away,2021-05-12 17:17:00,790,"Very cool, will you keep it at the cabin Dave?"
1073233,DRIFTER_016,2021-05-13 00:12:00,10439,"NAH, I want to have fun with it year round. Will keep it there once I move there full time when I retire."
1076404,DRIFTER_016,2021-10-03 21:36:00,10439,Lots of things going on at the cabin this summer. Flooring underlay installed in the main area.  Some work done on the gable end of the porch roof.  Also started installing the interior paneling. North wall in the front of the cabin is mostly done. This pic was part way through the install. It's up to the loft at this point.  South wall in the front of the cabin is also up to the loft so far. The blank spot will be drywall with tile over for the kitchen back splash.   Was hoping to pull the dock this weekend but the weather had other ideas. Can't pull the dock when you can barely stand up on it because of the waves. This was last weekend at ye olde cabin. Fall colours in full effect. Unfortunately they are on the ground now.  And at the launch on Wednesday morning when I went up to the cabin for the rest of the week. 
1070712,Sinker,2021-02-21 20:59:00,8692,"Nice. You still running the same venture? How many miles on it now? I just got a VK Pro. What a beast compared to the venture. Still have my venture too, no issues with it whatsoever. around 12K on it now. Winter is a great time to haul material. Get er done! S."
1070721,DRIFTER_016,2021-02-21 23:16:00,10439,Only just North of 5000 kms on it Sinker. Been a hard 5K though as I've moved probably more than 50 tonnes of materials with it. Probably why I wore out the clutch on it already. I'm looking at getting a SxS with tracks this year that will be fun and great for hauling with 1000# payload in the bed and 2000-2500# tow rating. Sure will make life easier when I get all my soral power materials. Those batteries are heavy.
1070749,Sinker,2021-02-24 14:53:00,8692,"Sweet. The VK has a much heavier clutch than the Venture, and the low gear is nothing but torque. We have  SXS at work with tracks, and you're right, it will haul anything, anywhere.  Make sure you get power steering, they are hard to turn without, and also close in the cab, ours is a very, very cold ride compared to a sled. I only use it if I have to, usually to rescue one of our trail grooming snowmobiles. Its a beast though, and gets the job done every time. S."
1070783,DRIFTER_016,2021-02-26 04:10:00,10439,"The Can-Am's are actually designed for tracks. There is a computer module that gets installed with the tracks that connects to the SxS's computer. It adds a track setting to the mode switch on the dash that changes operating parameters on the engine, transmission and electric power steering. It comes with climate control HVAC and I added heated seats. Damn thing even has power windows and power dump box."
1070830,Sinker,2021-02-28 19:57:00,8692,Beauty! It will haul some material!!

1071406,DRIFTER_016,2021-03-20 23:42:00,10439,Went out and worked on the trail for a few hours today. 	Watered down about 1/2 of the steep section to help with not blowing out the track. 	Got stuck good working on the new trail section up by the cabin. Dropped a ski off the trail and got sucked into waist deep sugar. A bunch of shoveling and yanking and with the help of my neighbour we got the grate big sled out of the woods and onto the trail again. 	Back at it tomorrow and then next weekend haul out flooring.

First go was in the summer and after 10 bales of insulation the machine had mechanical issues. 	Fast forward to the Easter long weekend and try number 2. Got the machine out to the cabin, hooked it up and there were some issues getting it running properly. I ended up pretty much servicing the machine and then went and bought shorter extension cords. The instructions say that 50' 12 guage cords are OK but I was having voltage issues and popping the breaker on the machine until I dropped down to 25' cords. I'm just glad it's done and I don't have to worry about it anymore. 	24"" of insulation should keep the cabin cozy I think. 😁 "

Temps of 5 degrees tomorrow before it gets cold for the rest of the week. It's  actually supposed to be below zero from tomorrow night until May 1st. Maybe I can even get some pellets out. If the trail isn't great I'll cut trees to make it wide enough to get the SxS up there this weekend. 😁

Good times, wind was cold, no sun to be seen and a bit of snow. 	My awesome neighbors were nice enough to plow a road from their place to mine so I can park right at the shore of my place. Going to make hauling materials a lot easier. Got a lot going in this year, 3,000 sq ft of interior panelling, 1,000 sq ft of flooring and 3 dozen sheets of plywood along with hopefully some custom cut pine for the front wall. You can see where I had to park before, way out where those little black dots in the distance are.  And a shot from the lake. "

1064139,DRIFTER_016,2020-07-18 15:08:00,10439,All my new lighting is 12 volts and is running off one 9AH gel battery at the moment that I haven't even recharged since last year. These LEDs use very little power. The 6 in the loft only draw 2.5 amps when running. I only use these lights when necessary at this point until I get the solar panel up. Main lighting is 110 volt LEDs. I have a bank of 4 batteries and 100 watt solar panel that will do the trick until I put in the big solar setup that will power the whole cabin. All 110 volt AC power is supplied by a 2KW Yamaha inverter generator. I have a 4KW generator for running my larger tools like rotary hammers and air compressors.
1064150,akaShag,2020-07-18 21:57:00,2073,"Thanks Dave.  I went a similar route for my hunt camp, except no 12 volt lights.  I am not smart enough to have both 12 and 110 volt systems side by each.  I have a big solar array through a charge controller to two massive 6 volt batteries, then out through an inverter to run the camp.  When the solar has been drawn down, I have a small inverter genny to run lights etc, and a big one for power tools. I surely do enjoy being in the camp at night, with lights on and NOT listening to a generator!!!  But in November and December, and a few guys with CPAP machines, the solar can't keep up, so we do run the small genny, with a LONG extension cord!"

Now I have some issues with the truck from all the deep water on the lake.  🙄  Now I've got work to do on the truck, sled, boat and one of my garages to get done before the ice goes out.  It's been a tough go this winter as I've not been well and am still in rough shape. What started out as a bad flu evolved into bacterial pneumonia and as of this week there is still something going on in my lungs and the bacteria seem to have had their way with my inner workings as my liver and kidneys aren't working quite right. More tests tomorrow, hopefully they find out what is going on and fix it."

That doesn't mean there weren't other cases, they just happened before testing. The docs are 99% sure I had it in February and March. I am still recovering and docs say there's still a while to go before I'm back to 100% again. For 5 months I couldn't do anything as I was too weak and couldn't breathe."
1064111,akaShag,2020-07-17 12:52:00,2073,"Oh, I have no doubt about the efficacy of quarantine, I just can't imagine hanging out ""somewhere"" in Whitehorse for two weeks and being confined to barracks. Glad to hear you are on the mend! Doug"
1064119,Old Ironmaker,2020-07-17 20:41:00,8243,"You most likely had it. I just hope there hasn't been any long term damage done. To have had it and come out the other end unscathed is rare. I pray you are rare. I have far too much information concerning this dreaded disease.  When I was tested at the beginning of July I was to my surprise told that the test is only 70% accurate. I am going in to get tested next week, my shortness of breath is not getting better. A customer of my wife's husband that was 60 years old and in good health died suddenly when they were taking a walk one evening. They tried to get into see their family Doc and were told the Dr. wasn't available and would do an examination over the telephone. If it worsens call 911 and or go to the emergency at the local hospital. Something I have done in the last 6 months. I don't know how blood pressure, heart rate, breathing etc. is determined over a telephone. These new phones can do amazing things but turning into a Doctor isn't one,,, ,,,,,yet. Long story short the gentleman found it almost impossible to get any air to the point his wife dialed 911. Sadly before the Paramedics arrived he had lost consciousness and was dead on arrival to the hospital. This was in Haldimand County, Caledonia specifically. Autopsy results showed heart disease of which the name currently eludes me. I find I am saying that more and more these days. Congestive Heart Failure, that was it. I remember!! No one wants to wait for hours, alone, in the emergency dept. in a hospital but don't let it slide. Everyone, please get medical treatment and advise before it's too late."

I went to emergency because I thought I was dying and couldn't breathe. Doc had me there for 6 hours doing tests as he thought I was having congestive heart failure. Luckily the tests and x-rays were all negative but did show the glass fiber looking things in my x-ray. At one point my BP was 193/139 and pulse ox dropped to 80% at one point. Eventually I got better but I was down and out for 156 days. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, although there's a certain someone in Ottawa I would like to give a double dose!!!  😜"

Need to try some different pellets as the one's I have are softwood pellets and they don't burn hot enough for my liking. 	They also produce too much ash which impedes the quality of the burn.

Light was really flat so the sledding was not a lot of fun as you couldn't see squat and hitting snow humps was pretty sketchy at times. The good news is the locals have plowed some decent roads on the lake and my neighbor has plowed right to his place and put in a great big parking lot for us. 😁 Did some trail packing and left it to harden up. 	Not as much on the ground so far this winter and I was banging rocks so I will have to bring out the shovel and move some snow onto the trail. The snow we get here is really sugary and doesn't pack well at all and doesn't give much traction. Now for the bad news, I blew a tire on the trailer on the way home and while I was changing it out I noticed the other tire has some pretty bad cracking going on on the inside of it. My second spare has a rim leak so unless I can fix it tonight I won't be going out tomorrow. 😪  "

1055935,SlipperyVic,2020-02-02 12:19:00,11,"You should be using this style of compression fitting that Cambridge Brass calls a Campak fitting. The look like this  It's a compression style fitting, but that little pinching screw makes all the difference. After the fitting is assembled and tightened, you clamp down those screws and the ridges inside the fittings bite into the outside of the poly pipe and give it some mechanical restraint. You can use these fittings above grade with no backfill and not have a problem.  Although the instructions say they are not required for a Campak fitting I always like to use the stainless steel poly pipe inserts with them anyways for some extra piece of mind.   A regular CB Compression type fitting is the one you want to avoid. These will seal poly pipe well but do not offer any mechanical restraint whatsoever. These fittings are designed to be burried, and the weight of the fill is what restrains the pipe. These fittings just seal.  Don't use this style:   Or else your going to have some dramatic failures.

1055945,SlipperyVic,2020-02-02 17:02:00,11," Yeah I'm specifically talking about the 2"" poly line from the pump. It generally comes in 50' rolls and you have to add your own termination to it. Best way is to fusion weld on a cam lock fitting but I that's not really an option for a home owner.  Fusion weld > Campak > CB Compression.  For smaller than 2"" the regular compression fittings work just fine. It's the 2"" that won't hold more than ~50psi and that's after being tightened with a pair of 48"" pipe wrenches by a guy who you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley."

Even after being plugged in for a couple of days she was dead flat. 😪 Got a new one from CT and it's currently on the bench charging.

1048274,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-10 03:56:00,10439,"Been raining plus I took 2 days off in town this week as well as a full day of fishing with Dara so haven't got a ton done this week. ? Got the North side of the loft all wired and insulated as well as a good portion of the West wall.  Moved my bench and all the tools over to the finished side and got the vaulted ceiling on the South side of the loft insulated.  Got a bit of plumbing stared in the West wall as well.  Installed plywood on the wall of the storage space under the stairs where the 120 volt and 12 volt electrical panels will go. 	Painted it up too.  On the opposite side of the wall inside the bedroom closet resides the SAT wiring. 	Still need to aim the dang things.  Lastly, I got myself a little fridge so I don't have to worry so much about ice. 	Built a decent temp shelf to hold it so I could reclaim the pair of sawhorses that were doing the duty previously. 	Fridge stays cold all night after shutting down the genny at bedtime.  Tomorrow is another fishing day with Dara before he flies back South on Monday."
1048278,DanD,2019-08-10 10:04:00,2223,Man what are you going to do with all your time after finishing the house? Other then fishing you’ll need to build a work shop that equals the work you’ve done on the house. Everything you’ve shown us all looks first rate. Congrats!!!! Dan.
1048279,Chuck Enwinde,2019-08-10 10:23:00,247,Hopefully it rains.  I think Dara is pretty good with wood lol.  Pretty amazing stuff Dave.  Good luck out there.     
1048325,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-11 23:09:00,10439,I didn't think it was possible but today I found a chore worse than painting. Caulking sucks big time!!!! What a horrible job!!! ???
1048328,ketchenany,2019-08-12 00:43:00,3229,"Dave,  I have followed this project from day one. I started doing  my basement  and it’s been  a nightmare. I did the plumbing/ sewer work. The contractor is doing the rest. But does not come every day, they have jobs as  it keeps the costs down (part time work but good), but it takes time, lots of time. I admire your work efforts and determination on this project. PLEASE write a book on the project. Do you watch  Mountain men?  I love seeing these guys on the homestead. I’ll come up with a title  for you lol “I built it, they will come”. Guiding is extra. I had fishing  friend who  was a  caulker he was known as the Cocker! NOCE readied Dave . thanks     good reading Dave. "

1048389,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-14 02:41:00,10439,Got some of the caulking on the West side of the cabin. 	Also started taking the scaffolding down.  	Finally got the SAT dishes aimed so I have tee vee now. I got some more plumbing mocked up and worked on my pellet cart that will live in the closet under the stairs. 	Here's a couple of pics. There's 440#'s of pellets in it. Should be enough for 11 days before needing to refill.   Had the drone up and took a few shots.

Got the laundry room electrical and plumbing roughed in and the insulation done.  Also got the washroom electrical and insulation in.

1048515,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-18 21:44:00,10439,I'm installing a pair of agricultural sprinklers on the roof. They will give me 90-100 feet of coverage completely around the cabin.
1048519,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-18 22:14:00,10439,Had a little time to do a few things around the cabin while I waited for the rain to mellow out this morning. 	Put in a little more insulation and got my scaffolding setup so I can get to installing the chimney for the pellet stove up and running.

1049084,Terry,2019-08-30 15:33:00,14456,great job  I was wondering about the two satellite dishes that far north is the angle too great to catch both sats on one dish or is it for greater signal strength
1049095,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-30 19:00:00,10439,They are larger than the regular dishes to pull in a better signal. One points to 91 the SD SAT and the other to 82 the HD SAT.

Got to the cabin after work and after lugging gear up the hill I chilled and watched a movie. 	Went to bed right after at 8:30-9:00 and didn't wake until 10:00AM the next morning still tired. Slept most of the day on the couch. Got up at 6:00PM for dinner and a movie. Went to bed at 9:00 and woke at 9:00 the next morning. Finally felt refreshed.  	Got a few of the ceiling joists installed properly finally. Still a bunch to go.  Also got some of the electrical rough in done.

He checked and it was 3.0, not good for anyone not on Diabetes meds, not good for anyone actually. When I was diagnosed with Type 2  in 97' I was over 50 lbs.  heavier. You have to care of yourself in order to enjoy your magnificent 3ork. When was the last time you have seen an 80 year old carrying an extra 60lbs? Not often I bet."

Akri you are right, the lakeshore of Erie and other Great Lakes was a mess this spring. The shoreline erosion is big news everywhere. Large chunks of ice the size of VW's bent super duty steel stairways and railings on breakwalls 15 feet above the new lake level. The shoreline restoration contractors out here are booked for the next 2 years. A great profession for some younger folks to get into. If lake levels stay as is, and the scientists say it wont be changing for the foreseeable future actually some say for a generation, shoreline restoration and protection will last someone enough work for a lifetime. Cost me over 5 grand last summer to repair and  bolster our breakwall, and I got a deal because I pulled both permits. A $1500.00 savings."

Lower section of the front wall electrical and insulation done.  Did I mention wiring? 
1047746,DRIFTER_016,2019-07-29 00:28:00,10439,Got the West end soffit completed on the main part of the roof today. 	Now I can put the fascia on and install my SAT dishes. 	Then finish the siding and trim work before disassembling all that scaffolding and moving it again.  
1047881,DRIFTER_016,2019-07-31 05:14:00,10439,Yesterday was a resupply day so no work. Did get out fishing for a bit after dinner though. 	Fish were super aggressive. Lost more than I landed but it was fun. 	Today was a rain day so I slept in and did inside work. Roughed in the closet in my bedroom.  Got the ceiling light wired in. 	It's a recessed housing that runs a low voltage mr16 bulb. 	I bypass the 110 to 12 volt transformer and go direct and hook to 12 volt DC system. 	It's currently running off one of my flasher batteries.  I also got the lighting in the closet temporarily hooked up.  	They run of 5 volts DC through a DC to DC converter off the 12 volt system. 	Right now they are running off the battery that came in the packaging to demonstrate the light.  	There was a little push button on the package.  Outdoor work tomorrow.
1047962,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-02 04:25:00,10439,Got the West side fascia and the SAT dishes installed.  Even had time for a little fishing after dinner.

The rest is going to have to wait until spring unless things change. 	After Tuesday it's going to be cold for the foreseeable future.

Was a bit more work than I thought it was going to be. ? 	Turns out the pilot bearing was toast and caused vibration that loosened the ring gear. Ring gear is hardened steel and the flywheel is aluminium. It was press fit so we pressed it back on and will peen the edge with a center punch to keep it on.

1038544,DRIFTER_016,2018-12-31 18:35:00,10439,"Well I did some digging and it seems to be an older version of Bad River Outdoors game cart. 	Built fer hauilin' dinner out of the field after droppin' it. 	It's quite a bit heavier than the new models it seems as the new models have aluminium frames and bicycle type rims and tires while mine has ATV type rims and tires with a heavy steel frame. 	Also looking at the features of the different ones this seems to be their top model. 	Hopefully I get it all fixed up for a reasonable cost, although with a list price of $4,599 US I'm guessing parts are probably a little expensive.  	I did get a good deal for $200 though.   ? http://www.badriveroutdoors.com/little-mule-cart.php"

1040320,DRIFTER_016,2019-02-10 22:32:00,10439,Got out to the cabin for the first time since October today.  	Spent my time packing trail. Man was that a chore. More snow than usual in the bush this year. 	My heavy a$$ touring sled is not really meant for breaking trail in tight quarters especially when the snow is nuts deep!!!!!! 	Took some time to get up my hill. About 1/2 way up I put the sled on it's side. No problem roll the 700# beast upright and keep going. 	The last 30' or so is the steep section and there is a bend right at the bottom. Got stuck a few times and made it almost all the way up and got stuck again. Short break in the cabin to get my breath back before packing the top of the trail by foot. That was the ticket. Made 'er up. Took about an hour to pack down the area around my cabin and then a trip down the hill to smooth it out.  	Finally another hour of packing the trail from the shore to the ice road then call it a day. Hopefully back at it next weekend.

I no longer own a snowmobile, but I DO have a tracked Argo.  And if it tips onto its side I am probably DOA anyways and won't need to worry about getting it right side up.  They can recover the Argo with my frozen body.?

Was gusting 40 MPH out of the North too.  ? 	Managed to stuff the nose of the boat into the back of an over-sized wave on the way back to the dock to top things off. 	The dog was unimpressed with being hosed by a wall of 54* F water. I wasn't thrilled either!!!  ? So it rained from the time I got there on Friday until just about dinner time on Saturday so I spent the day making window trim and a few pieces for the area under the deck.

1034091,Hack_Fisherman,2018-09-17 00:44:00,720,"WTH, I can’t see the pics!"
1024356,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-12 00:13:00,10439,Plenty of firewood. The spruce up here is like hardwood as it's so old and the rings so tight. Too much like work and most wood stoves are down to ashes by morning. Don't want to wake up and have to work on the fire before I've even had a pee and a coffee!!! The pellet stove I have will run 24-36 hours on a full hopper of pellets. It's easy to get the pellets out to the cabin and I have more than enough room to store a full years worth plus some extra in case. When I end up moving out there for my retirement I will have a road from the lake to the cabin and will beable to drive right to the basement doors to unload. Between now and retirement I'll easily be able to get by on 2 skids a year. It will be way less work than cutting and chopping trees. Will be much less mess too.
1024416,16 Footer,2018-03-13 09:54:00,191,Will the pellet stove give the same heat as a wood stove? What R value are you insulating your cabin?
1024437,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-13 17:33:00,10439,"The stove's output is 42,000 BTU's which is a couple of thousand more than a Blaze King Princess wood stove. They rund about the same time on high. Insulation is R40 in the floor, R24 in the walls and R60 in the ceiling."
1024443,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-13 20:07:00,8243,You didn't scrimp on insulation Big Dave. Is the pellet stove your only source of heat?
1024444,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-13 20:17:00,10439,"I may have a small propane unit in the laundry room and will have a 20,000-30,000 BTU propane unit in the basement to keep the water lines and pumps from freezing. Also to keep the shop warm for playing with my toys."
1024451,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-13 20:39:00,8243,"When I reno'd the little lake front cottage I didn't put enough insulation in. It was only supposed to be 3 season and a few winter weekends. R-13 walls, R24 ceiling and R 40 floors. Up to 40% heat loss is through the floors. Many windows, more windows than walls I bet. Heat loss calculation said 85,000 BTU's required. We have a 45K BTU gas fireplace that did OK for 17 years but needed 2 of those oil electric heaters in the front or is it back, the front to me is the lake side. Anyway I installed duct work and a hi-eff 85,000 BTU NG furnace last winter. Now it's warm during a lake effect storm. Hydro bill is about 60% less now. It really wasn't ridiculous before. 200 bucks in winter months, we have gas stove, water heater and dryer. No stand alone freezers or central A/C, 2 portables did it all, putting in central air next month.  You will find out what you will need next winter which starts when? August I am told."
1024452,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-13 21:01:00,10439,"I won't find out until I do all the electrical, plumbing and insulation. That gets done in 2019. My neighbors cabin is about the same square footage and they heat it with a 30,000 BTU propane unit. They run it wide open though, but their pace is really toasty."
1024666,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-18 23:24:00,10439,Back out at the cabin again this weekend.  	Took out a bunch of stuff including the window for my washroom. 	Even got it installed.  	Makes a big difference with all the natural light it lets in.   Moved my kitchen away from the stairs and into the shower area in the washroom so I could put the pellet stove in it's location to see how it fits and looks. 	Fits good.  	Looks good!!!  
1024680,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-19 03:42:00,8243,"Dave I have 2 things to say about your future insulation 1) Thermal Break. 2) Closed cell expanding foam. The stove looks great there. I know a guy out here on the lakefront that uses the pellet stove as his main heat source for 2000 ftsq and loves it. No vaulted ceilings though, a big factor. Not all of us can fall, cut, split, buck and haul in cordwood once the body decides to retire too. My back is so screwed up now I have a problem lifting a plastic garbage can with 2 bags into the back of the truck. I have to buy 12 packs of brown pops now, a 24 is too much to carry. Vodka and Cognac is much more effective by volume weight than beer anyway."
1024704,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-19 16:18:00,10439,"The biggest problem with this is cost and being able to get the equipment close enough to the work site to do it. I have the 2 part foam kit to do all the tight voids and headers, but to get enough to do the entire cabin would cost over $10K to do it that way. To get a commercial insulator to come and spray Walltite ECO would be difficult at best and most likely impossible. I could get a road plowed into the shore from the ice road but they would still be 200' from the cabin and I'm not sure if they could spray from that far away especially when the temp are below freezing. They are also expensive. Batt insulation for the walls and vaulted portion of the ceiling and most likely blown in for the flat section is the way it's going to be. Along with good vapor barrier, tuck tape and acoustic sealer. FYI, it was beautiful in the cabin this weekend even without insulation. At least with the sun streaming in the front windows."
1024708,mikeh,2018-03-19 18:30:00,824,how are the pellet stoves vented? how the heck would it heat the whole house?we are looking at cottages and homes and like the idea for heat
1024709,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-19 19:30:00,8243,"Dave I figured your accessibility to the home would be an issue for closed cell equipment. Cost is a big consideration as well. At my age the ROI is something I need to take into consideration if I ever build again. A few years ago I opted to pass on the lifetime warranty on a steel roof. At 85 years old he last thing I would worry about is replacing the architectural shingles. For my 20 and 30 something Godchildren, nieces and nephews it matters when the ROI kicks in. I always tell the guys do not scrimp on the Tuck Tape, install the vapour barrier properly using acoustic sealant at the sills. Make the building envelope as tight as possible. No one is going to suffocate for lack of O2. An improperly sealed dwelling is like going to all the trouble and expense of insulating properly then opening the front door and leave it open all year. Almost the same goes for a wall of cheap windows. The last time I checked a pane of glass is R-3 max. It's been a while. You know what you are doing big guy. As far as the question re: venting CO from the pellet stove the 1 I have seen has a stack, it not only vents CO it provides some ambient heat from the waste gas.  I always ask HVAC folks and Building Inspectors, when I have all 5 gas burners going on the stove and oven cooking the Bird, where does the CO go? No exterior hood vent here. The question is usually met with silence."
1024718,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-19 21:32:00,10439,"Pellet stoves are vented usually with 4"" double walled stainless vent pipe. Mine will vent straight from the stove through the ceiling using a metal insulated box through the insulation zone. There will be 6"" double walled stainless pipe connected to the box abd running through the roof. The 4"" will reside inside the 6"" pipe. There will be a chimney cap and flashing that covers both pipes. This is to conform to code for WETT certification. The cabin is 24'X36' open concept easy to heat with a wood or pellet stove especially when centrally located. There will be a 5' ceiling fan to move the air around as well as a convection fan on the stove. Where you are connected to the grid a regular pellet stove features a built in fan to move the air but they also have blowers in the chimney and an auger to move the pellets into the burn chamber. All of this craps out when the power is out."
1024723,Tom S,2018-03-19 22:39:00,362,"A tight building envelope is great, but you do need to let that building breathe somehow. To tight of an envelope can cause major humidity issues, plus smells and sickness can become trapped in the house. The trick is to have a tight envelope and a Heat Recovery Ventilator, which will bring fresh air into the house while preheating it with the exhaust air to improve efficiency. I believe they are now code on new builds in Ontario. Your stove puts out ~7,000 BTU per burner, so call it 35,000 BTU if everything is cranked up full. Your furnace is ~100,000 BTU. Lots more CO coming off the furnace, and because it's running through the day the CO will build up. You typically run a stove for 1-2 hours a day, so the CO is much less and won't build up over time to a dangerous level. Even when cooking all day you'll probably have less overall CO buildup than the furnace would over a couple hours."
1024730,Raf,2018-03-19 23:25:00,3495,"we have a wood stove in the basement of our backsplit.  while not NWT (just west of orangeville), it does the job of keeping the house warm without running the furnace until it gets to -25 or so.  ceiling fans help move the air around. what i find works really well is to take advantage of convection (warm air rises, cool air falls) by placing a fan on ground level of the floor and pointing it down into the basement.  This accelerates convection by forcing cold air into the room with the wood stove, displacing the hot air in that room, and the hot air has no place to go but right back up the stairs along the ceiling.  you can see this by placing a piece of paper at the bottom -of the landing even with the fan off you will see the cold air going into the basement and, at the top of the landing, the hot air returning."
1024866,Sinker,2018-03-22 13:49:00,8692,I do the exact same thing at my place. Also a split level with a woodstove in the basement. My furnace rarely kicks in if the fire is going.
1025905,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-08 01:35:00,10439,"Just noticed that there were 666 posts in this thread. Gotta fix that post haste!!! Was out at the cabin doing a little work today. The temps are getting up into the minus single digits and the sun is shining. Took out some lumber and all the chimney pieces for my stove. Got the cement board installed but have to wait for above freezing temps to do the tiling of the hearth. Then I can get the stove all installed although it will need to be removed when I install the posts for the stair railings and the river rock veneer behind the stove. That's a couple of years out.  They sure don't give the chimney fixin's away. Stuff is uber spendy. I've got $1,200 into this pile of chimney and duct work.  Oh well, at least I'll have heat."

1014978,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-07 20:28:00,8243,"I have to say she's lookin' good Dave. Those invisible Minions you hide out of camera view are doing a bang up job. That view of the Norden Lites from inside is much more than a million dollar view, it's in the billion range.   I can't agree with that Lucas. I could go on for pages talking about heat/cooling loss. In my experience the difference between R-24 bat insulation and spraying in a closed cell makes a huge difference in savings on heating and cooling. The other thing that Mr. Holmes stresses is to insulate both sides of the building envelope, I can not for the life of me remember the term as I type. Imagine a large or even small home that has bat insulation between the wall studs. There is virally no resistance value to dimensional lumber. Add up all the wall 2x's and you may be surprised how much of the house has only the R value of the dimensional lumber. Having a place on the lake and the lake side has rather large windows and an 8.5' patio door, a single pane window is something like R-2, even a triple pane window might be R-6. If I remember the term for completely enveloping a building I will post it. Oldtimers moment. I was in the Sunroom business and we sold some products through Home Depot as installation services contractors after I took my pension and not to name drop but had a couple of cold ones and chicken wings with Mr. Holmes on a few occasions and insulting was one of the topics of conversation besides fishing. He was working with HD at the time, 2006.  For anyone that is new here and has not read back 30 pages it has to be stated that Dave has a few dozen of those little Minions helping him, he will deny it but there is no way 1 man has done that solo, no way whatsoever!!!

Mike is a real good guy, I was surprised to learn earlier on in his TV career most of the money for the remodels came out of his own pocket. He is a lot smaller on TV than in real life.  My two cents on this - closed cell is nice and is in many was a superior insulating product, but it's insulating and sealing properties can actually be detrimental at times. Building envelopes become so tight that heat recovery ventilators are required to be installed because the building is unable to breathe. At a certain point any energy savings gained by the use of foam is lost through the ventilators, which can run anywhere from 50-90% efficient (depending on models and design). I believe that spray foam is excellent for use in places such as basements where a tight seal and mold resistance is a great property, but not so much on the main levels of buildings. R24 batting between studs with an R5 sheathing is plenty good enough for the rest of the building and may reduce the need for whole house ventilation compared to sprayed foam.  PS. Love watching this build progress thread."
1015007,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-08 04:33:00,8243,"Yes Tom I'm with you. Many homes now do need a whole house ventilation system due to it's air tightness. They have come a long way since first introduced in the trade. Blowing cold air in a warm home isn't good. I worked with an engineer years back to preheat the incoming ventilating air with the waste gases from a furnace, gas fireplace and or gas hot water heater. The incoming duct had an exterior sleeve where warm waste gas heated the incoming line. Same principle as combustion air being preheated going to Blast Furnace stoves. The problem, ensuring the incoming line could not be breached or you will kill everyone in the house with CO, not good. Too many intangibles for me to continue in the project.  There was a time when those R-2000 houses came out a fire in a fireplace wouldn't stay lit or a candle on a table. The advantage I see beyond the R value in closed cell is that it makes the envelope air tight. One can have R-36 in a wall and a few light switches, receptacles or windows etc. that are not properly sealed and tapped vapour barrier can be like leaving a window or even the front door open in January. The other thing I constantly shake my head at is improper roof venting. Reverse ventilation can take place if too much or too little can rot a roof in no time. There is a McMansion out my way that is 5 years old, they are replacing the roof including the sheathing because some roofer thought the more vents the better. The underside of the roof is laden with mold and has rotted, 5 years new!!"

What are you going to use for the siding? A neighbour tore down an old cottage lakeside and built new and used the Hardy board siding set vertically and did the gable ends in the shingles very similar to yours. We love the look of the board and siding vertically rather than horizontally. Nothing but a Hurricane will damage it, then it's maybe a Hurricane."

We too can't have a big enough bathroom and shower. I turned a 8.5'X 16' bedroom into a bathroom and 4'X8' laundry room. No tub, but it is roughed in for the next owners. I can count on 1 hand how many times we filled the tub where we lived before we moved to the lake. Yes there are days I wish I could soak this old tired body but we decided to put a Spa on the deck instead. That was 17 years ago, still no Spa and I was in the business????

Was rainy and windy on Saturday so I did some screen work along the eves to keep the skitters and birds out of the cabin. Got my new cabin toy assembled too. But mostly I slept.    Sunday was nice and sunny so I got the material lift all hooked up and set up the ladder. Then I loaded up the boat and went to play. Went 2/5 and had fun playing with the new sonar units. Spent most of the time recording contours and have my bay almost 1/2 mapped now.

I watch all those Arctic shows where everyone starts getting ready for winter when the first freeze and snow is hitting in 24 hours or they starve or freeze to death.

Is there a specific sound barrier?  http://www.westmansteel.ca/technical/faqs/#faq-15  Steel roofing not only provides strength, but also when coupled with high build finishes, absorbs and deadens much of the noise (when applied direct to the deck). With the home insulation standards of today, you should not notice any difference in noise levels between roofing materials."

I placed my steel roof on top of the 1/2 plywood with a water proof wrap paper between, same noise as regular shingles. I even used same steel as siding but different colour. Easy to install, last long time, same cost or less than vertical vinyl siding."

Light blue line is the ice road and red X is my cabin.  PS plenty of ice as it's over 4 feet thick.    Even if I could park right at the shore I would still have to sled it up to the cabin.

Unfortunately they will not run power as it's too costly to do so through the bush with no roads. Too bad as there is a hydro plant less than a mile away from my place. I will eventually be running solar with generator backup but just running generator at this time. Not an island, it's a peninsula.  "

On the way up (about an 8 hour drive); I pack the food in the cooler with about 4 lbs of dry ice. I can get it here at Praxair for $2.00 a pound.; everything stays froze solid and there's no wet packaging; when we get to camp. On the way home; everything that has been froze (properly packaged fish LOL) gets wrapped in an old sleeping bag, so that the frozen packages are in the center. Then stuff the bag into the cooler; along with any towels or whatever to fill the cooler tight. Get home and unpack the cooler and the frost will still be on the outside of the packages and the fillets as hard as a brick. I didn't believe this would work; when the camp owner told me to do this; 20 some years ago but it does. His question to me, when I was trying to buy ice from him; ""what's the first thing you do when thawing fish; you put it in cold water right?"" What does ice do when it begins to melt; turns into cold water and starts thawing your fish. The newbes on our trips think I'm nuts, when they see me packing the cooler; but are quite surprised when I unpack it at home.  Dan."

974761,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-24 23:54:00,10439,The vacation and the work has started. Due to unfinished stuff @ home I was a day and a half late setting off to the cabin. All was not lost though as Mr B told me the launch and parking area was a gong show on Tuesday due to the Aboriginal Day holiday. The lot was full and they were even having to park on the road!! Wednesday though all was peaceful at the ramp with only 4 vehicles in the lot when I got there at lunch.      Got a couple of my windows installed. The view out of my bedroom doesn't suck.        Been working on skitter proofing the eves and even threw up some rafter vents.

This thing will keep my halibut frozen on the trip back from Alaska no problem. Pretty sure I can jam at least $600 worth of yummy halibut in there frozen and it will still be completely frozen solid when I get home a few days later. So far after 1/2 a day the ice hasn't even started to think of melting yet.

Around here the govt used to let you mark out and lease a lot, and the railway did it for years as well. All that has stopped as far as I know.  edit...reading your sled build I see you called it a lease..I assume 100 yr govt? Can you pick your spot or are things designated  and again after further blog reading my questions are answered..thank you"

966666,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-16 22:40:00,10439,"Well today didn't go exactly as planned. Got my doors, couches and these two windows up to the cabin. While taking these windows up I going a bit too slow and got stuck at the last section of my hill and spun the track and buried the sled. Ended up catching a piece of gravel with the track and it hit my rad and put a hole in it. Day over!!!!  Tomorrow I'll have to figure out hot to get the rad out of my sled and hopefully it can be welded up.  Have to borrow a buddies sled next week and get my windows in before it's too late.  Time for rum and hockey!!!   "
966718,Sinker,2016-04-17 15:15:00,8692,Yuk. That sucks. What are the chances of that happening eh? Sheesh.  S.
966973,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-19 19:53:00,10439,Ordered up a new rad for the sled @ lunch today.Not totally insane price either @ $350.Now the fun part. Seems I was right in assuming you have to completely disassemble the sled to replace it.  The shop says it's 16 hrs labour.Glad I know haw to do things for myself. Even the motor has to be removed to get the thing out.
966976,Dara,2016-04-19 19:57:00,3052,"You have your work cut out for you there...sorry about your luck.  Start with a nice clean shop and don't stop till you're done  Thats the venture, not the venture light right?"

But the brainy engineers in Japan figured it would be better to have it mount from the inside behind the motor. Personally I would have had it bolt in from the outside. But I'm no engineer!!!"
966986,Dara,2016-04-19 20:33:00,3052,"Look at it this way...you barely ever have to work on a Yamaha so they make it so the mechanic can make a couple bucks when he finally gets to  Mine has 16,000 km on it now"

967424,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-23 20:24:00,10439,Borrowed a buddies sled and got my windows out to the cabin and safely stowed until I can get them installed. The main access point is getting sloppy with melt and mud but my other access point is still mint. Went in that way and came out the regular way. The alternate route is much smoother and will probably good for a couple of weeks still. The ice on the lake is still perfect and there is no melting on it as yet. The snow melted and packed with the 3 days of warm weather earlier in the week but that makes it easier to get around.    No issues getting from the ice road to the shore by the cabin this week. Last week the snow was still thigh deep but this week maybe a few inches.    The smaller windows all stowed inside.    The big and heavy ones are outside.    Lost most of the snow up by the cabin with the warm up this week too.

Try a DIY on a Benz, there is no such thing. The Germans make tools for every jib to be done, BMW's included, and Audi's while I'm at it. I restored a 69 SEL and there was a special ""alien"" wrench just to remove a door panel screw. Some tools are more a key than a wrench.  Something like replacing a rad in the bush is something you should be able to do during lunch break."

It's about 1/2 km or so to the cabin from there. I took this picture from the shore. You can see my truck off in the distance.    Later in the season I can get out there but not until the snow melts down a ways. The snow's too deep at this time of the year though. Can't get there until late April.

935459,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-20 21:20:00,10439,Another miserable weather weekend here in YK. Rain and high winds all day Saturday and showers and wind today. Got out for a few hours today to clean up all the water from yesterdays storm and to tarp the roof. Quite the pain in the butt man handling a 30'X40' tarp solo in 40 km gusts!!!      
935486,Ralph Field,2015-09-20 23:35:00,1018,I can't imagine how you accomplished that on your own.

937701,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-02 02:13:00,8243,Are you going to explain to me Dave how 1 guy got that tarp onto a roof solo? You had better hurry up or the Mothership is leaving without you!!  I've always meant to ask is articangler.ca your site?
937706,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-02 03:03:00,10439,Are you going to explain to me Dave how 1 guy got that tarp onto a roof solo? You had better hurry up or the Mothership is leaving without you!!  I've always meant to ask is articangler.ca your site?  Getting the 30X40 tarp in place was a bit of a chore. I attached one corner to my material lift and sent it up. Then I went up on the roof and hauled it up. Started securing it in the NW corner and worked my way down the side and across the front. It wasn't really that hard as the 2 days I secured it properly there was virtually no wind.  And yes the site's mine. I really need to update it one of these days.
937708,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-02 03:21:00,8243,"I know you are alone up there Dave so you have to promise to work smart and above all safely. I don't want to be Chicken Little but the week before the Labour Day weekend we lost a young Father and Husband to a simple fall of less than 10 feet from a residential build here in our small town. Something he has done a few thousand times in his 15 years in construction. Just be careful Dave, please."
937710,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-02 03:31:00,10439,I'm very careful as I wouldn't be found for days if I tumbled off the roof. I'm not big on heights so I tend to make extra sure on my footing.

Not sure why but it's plenty strong and less expensive. Maybe that's why. Also our snow loads are very low here compared to a lot of places.

932029,16 Footer,2015-08-31 10:03:00,191,Metal roof last a long time and is the way to go. Snow will slide off a metal roof but put catch clips over doorways. Shingles don't last in harsh weather conditions and are a pain to remove / get rid of when they go bad.
932034,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-31 11:09:00,8243,"Get the OSB covered asap, it doesn't like water. You know that already. I see it holding up much better than some ridiculously thin plywood I have seen used."

929053,akaShag,2015-08-11 23:28:00,2073,"back to Steve...............I have never heard of even a 35 pound laker coming out of Lake Ontario.  I would wager a very, very large sum of money that large numbers of  40 lb lake trout will never be caught in Lake Ontario.  Not to rain on your parade, just saying that this lake has been stocked with lake trout for decades, there are millions of angler/rod hours, and big lakers over 20 pounds are pretty uncommon given the amount of angler effort.  Maybe a question of genetics, maybe a question of food, I do not know, but count me as a die-hard skeptic for big Lake O greys.  Just sayin'...................  Are there any published stories with confirmed weights for Lake O lakers?  Doug"
929059,dave524,2015-08-11 23:49:00,4508,"New York State record was caught in 03 at 41 1/2 pounds, surprisingly it was caught in Lake Erie."
929074,Steve,2015-08-12 00:38:00,2075,"True, but the previous New York State record Lake Trout was 39lbs 8 ounces, which was caught in 1994 (May 5th) - in Lake Ontario.  I see pics of Lakers up to 30lbs every year on the various boards from Lake Ontario, including a 34lbs'er last year shown on LOU.  Crap, in the last two years, 20lbs plus Lakers have outpaced 20lbs plus Kings two or three to one...at least in the west end of Lake O and the south shore of Lake O.  Not sure what to tell you Doug, but tons of 20lbs plus lakers in Lake Ontario, a number of 30lbs plus lakers....and likely in less than 10 years, some 40lbs plus lakers."
929076,akaShag,2015-08-12 00:43:00,2073,"Thanks Steve, this is all news to me.  Here in Eastern Lake Ontario there are lots of lakers caught, but I rarely hear of twenty pounders.  Maybe I need to listen harder!  Doug"
929091,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-12 02:11:00,10439,"Over the years I have caught many lakers over 20#'s in Lake O. Back in the 90's when the Ganny had epic fall laker runs due to the stocking there it was not uncommon to get several over 20 in a few hours in the evening. Also have caught lots in Western Lake O but the biggest (in the mid 30's) came off Pt. Credit in August after a North blow.  Having said that, compared to our Arctic Lakers they fight like wet socks!!!"

But this morning there wasn't a breath of wind. It was a bit chilly though after the front went through.    Good run up the lake with my shiny new prop. I removed the vent plugs and it performs better out of the hole now too.      And now the moment a bunch of you have been waiting for. Time to reveal my rig for getting my materials up on the roof.         Got about 3/4 of the South roof sheathed today so I'm pretty happy.

928928,SirCranksalot,2015-08-11 12:26:00,3291,I think that one weighs as much as all that I caught in Muskoka over the last 2 years!!!
927899,adam lancia,2015-08-05 15:35:00,234,"That looks great! And lots of nice, solid looking rocks to put anchors into for a dock.  I think he said the two windows on the left side will be 5' x 8', those little ones are just temporary."
927903,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-05 15:44:00,10439, Looks awesome bud! Will there be more and larger windows facing the lake?  Those 2 little windows in the front are just temporary. There will be 4 5'X8' windows across the front.  Where ever you see bare wood is a window.
927906,lew,2015-08-05 15:49:00,12766,The place is really coming along great Dave and thanks for posting the pictures of the progress.

928173,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-06 22:05:00,10439,Well it took most of the day but I got the ridge board in place and secured!!! Took about 2 1/2 hours to rig the crane and about 3 1/2 to raise the ridge and secure it. I figure the board weighs in at about 250#.  Think I'll do light work the rest of the day and start rafters tomorrow.

926299,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-27 06:16:00,8243,"Great to follow your solo project. Do you not have any friends up there to lend a hand? It really doesn't look like you need any help though.  Dave just curious why you chose pink over Roxul, which I loved working with or even a closed cell insulation spray. One small tank of spray is easier to transport and will give you almost double the R factor for the same depth if I remember correctly and no vapour barrier required. It's been a while since my last heat loss calculation. I do remember that 30% of heat loss is through the floor so even just spraying the floor alone would be worth  the R.O.I.  Have you considered a Wind Turbine at sometime. I'm sure you have the wind rates to support one. The last I looked 50K would get you a system that has an ROI of 15 years. But that's for a full time residence and yours is not, yet.  I need more than Advil just thinking about what you are accomplishing. More pics please. Keep up the good work."

All my friends are either working, lazy or injured. It's OK though the workout and feeling of accomplishment is great!! The floor insulation for the most part was free!!! All except 30% which I had to purchase to finish the job. The blue SM were left over off cuts from a commercial job downtown that my neighbours brought home for me and the pink was reclaimed from another job they did. My walls and ceiling are getting Roxul as I hate working with fiberglass, unless it's free of course.  Yes I'm looking at a wind turbine down the way as an addition to the solar setup I will be installing. My solar setup looks to be about 8K and to add a 300W turbine another 2K.  Currently taking an Advil break while typing this!!!"
926345,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-27 17:39:00,8243,"The best price on anything is free. Good score. That is a great price for a wind turbine. I imagine you would be able to use the same battery bank for both the solar and wind power. 2 for 1 special. I have a beat up body after years of abusing it both on and off the job, not social abuse. Ice, ice and more ice. Some for the joints and muscles and the balance for the Mojitos'."

926214,Musky or Specks,2015-07-26 11:50:00,2710,"Dave, no one says you have to build a wall all in one pc. Figure what you can lift by yourself and do it a pc at a time. I've even joined window/door openings this way just put in the header afterwards. Saves on all the wall jack building although you waste a little more aspenite. I've built everything but the roof by myself on some 2000 + sq and that's how I managed to keep a good pace. And yes it looks great everyone here is extremely jealous I'm sure.

There are great paying jobs here, but the mine jobs are usually 2 weeks on 2 weeks off. Which ain't too bad. You get a 2 week holiday every month!!!"
926266,Musky or Specks,2015-07-26 21:58:00,2710,"  There are great paying jobs here, but the mine jobs are usually 2 weeks on 2 weeks off. Which ain't too bad. You get a 2 week holiday every month!!! Well I'm a heavy truck parts guy let me know if you here of anything. Worked for both Freightliner and International."
926295,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-27 04:45:00,10439,Got the 16' section of the South wall ready to raise today. Should have finished it but neighbour came over and we yakked for too long. Took him out fishing after dinner for 3 hours and I managed an 8# troot right @ the end after each of us missing a couple. Bonked it and neighbour and I are going to have it for dinner tomorrow with some BBQ'd caribou. Arctic surf and turf!!!
926296,manitoubass2,2015-07-27 05:03:00,11391,Aka one too many rums ???  Mmmm caribou?

Time to put the tools away for the night, watch a movie and have a rum or ten!!!  I did get a bunch of work done though so all is not lost. Hopefully get the underside done tomorrow so I can insulate the floor and put the sub-floor down.  "

After some serious supervising I know I can catch a few fish for dinner and really have a great beer batter recipe I know you'll enjoy........I'll even do the dishes. Just think about it........no pain....a drink in your hand.....fresh walleye dinner....no mess. Life can't get any better then that.............."
924531,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-13 01:57:00,10439,Didn't get any floor stuff done today. Back is killing from the last couple of days and it's blowing a gale here. Didn't want to be handling 75# sheets of OSB sub flooring and get blown off the structure. So I finished putting in my nailing blocks for the ends of the ceiling panels below and started sheathing the crawl space walls. Will try to finish it tomorrow but they are calling for rain all day.      They were doing a back burn out @ Harding Lake to kill off the South flank of the Hearn Lake fire today as well.  
924534,mr blizzard,2015-07-13 02:10:00,1589,"awesome Dave but govt at its best all water bombers sat idle at the airport today while ash fell over the town, the old adage if its not hindering property dont worry about it, yet they r still wondering about the long term health effects of the smoke, maybe the costs of putting out the fires will be cheaper than the long term health effects that the hospital will have to endure in the years to come,  when u finish get a air purifier just saying, awesome job, proud of ur progress"
924556,Dara,2015-07-13 12:53:00,3052,Nice work....I almost made it up to help next month but plane tickets are a tad expensive

Got the rest of my sheathing done on the crawl space walls and started getting the floor down and insulated. 3"" Styrofoam SM for the first layer and 2 layers of R15 fiberglass on top for a total of R45 in the floor. Should have toasty tootsies.      "
925655,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-22 03:15:00,10439,"Got the floor finished today. All insulated, caulked and painted (mostly, I ran out of paint with about 1/4 to go)    Also got my basement/crawl space door jams in.    Starting on the walls tomorrow."

923619,Sinker,2015-07-07 03:02:00,8692,"I would have suggested doing that different, but that will work. Takes a lot of time though. Im seriously considering flying there. How long you figure until your done? Is all the material there up to the roof? It wouldnt take long at all to frame that up. A few good days and the roof would be going on.  Looking good. I look forward to following this. Very cool stuff!  S."
923621,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-07 03:10:00,10439,"Hey Sinker, I'm on vacation until the 9th of August. Everything is on site to get it closed in.  Here's a couple of materials pics.      "

923830,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-08 02:58:00,10439,"No work for me today. Went into town to resupply and bring more stuff out to the site. Needed another box of screws and a couple of cases of PL400 for the floor. Also brought out another 11 giant garbage bags of repurposed fiberglass insulation for the floor. Pretty sure I still have about 8 or 10 bags to go. Got near 20 out here now. The most important thing I needed was ice cubes for de rum drinks. Still had life left in my ice blocks frozen in milk jugs but my cubes ran out last night.  According to the weather guy, tomorrow might be another down day. I guess I could catch up on my rest.  Or drink more rum and watch moovees on my 'puter."

923126,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-04 03:27:00,10439,"I'm currently on week 2 of my extended summer vacation and have been hard on getting some cabin building done. First thing needed was a dry, shady and bug free zone to chillax in when the working was done.  Threw up this temporary shack in a weekend.  Now onto the cabin building segment. Took a lot longer than expected to layout the foundation. Drilled 1/4"" holes in the granite to drop my nails into to run my string lines.  Then it was time to drill 1"" diameter holes 8"" deep to drop my pier saddles into.  Then the saddles had to be set in non-shrink grout to hold them in place, before running my water level to figure out pier heights.   Then it was time to install my piers.   Now I need to frame in between the perimeter piers and once that's done I can install my floor joists. If all goes according to plan I will have a floor by next week sometime.  Oh, and to keep it fishing related I did get out here and there and even managed to catch some troots!!!"
923131,grimsbylander,2015-07-04 04:18:00,3016,That's a foundation with no chance of moving or cracking! Awesome job. Keep the pictures coming!
