1079662,Pangle,2022-04-07 02:10:00,64,"Hi, I have a question regarding trolling motor plugs.  I think I know the answer but just want to confirm. i am replacing a fortrex 80 lb 24v with a terrova ipilot 80lb 24v.  Both motors draw 56amps. I have 60 amp breakers installed and use 6 ga wires. Can I simply use the old plug on the new terrova? thanks pete "

Depending on the age of the Fortrex you may need to switch the plug on your terrova to your old foretrex plug or swap receptacles. It’s really up to you what you want to do either way you can use that plug on your new trolling motor or vice versa etc. totally cross compatibility without concern for voltage or amperage."
