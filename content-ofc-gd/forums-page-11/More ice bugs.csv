1079057,David Chong,2022-03-09 14:29:00,836,They look great!!!!
1079118,SirCranksalot,2022-03-13 02:44:00,3291,"An update---bud and I went to Lake X in Muskoka yesterday. Marking fish was a rare event except at my buds hole # 5, 6, or maybe 7 late in the day. He caught 3 or 4 small lakers on his Simcoe bug. He doesn't use a drop shot rig----just the bug with a pinhead minnow hooked thru the nose. Pinheads were all the shop had. The prev time he had done the same with a 2- 3"" minnow.¬† I used a drop shot with a Meegs at the bottom tipped witha variety of things---3 or 4 pinheads, a chunk of worm, and other things. I had one of my bigger bugs tipped with a pinhead about 40 cm up the line. No takers, but then again very few lookers. I guess you can display all sorts of delectable goodies in your store front window but if there is nobody passing by to see them then you are SOL. He is more patient than I am. It seems to take forever to sink 70 ft. It seemed even longer when I tried it with Berkley Ice line-----maybe that's a bit buoyant, not a true braid. Maybe one more try next week on Lake Y.  BTW, he mentioned that his Simcoe bug had tungsten which I guess is quite heavy. Does your have tungsten or some other metal? thx"
1079126,misfish,2022-03-13 17:09:00,29133,LEAD WRAPS AND BRASS BEAD I will make tungsten next time.
1079244,Sinker,2022-03-18 18:00:00,8692,A dime of what?¬†üòÇ
1079246,akaShag,2022-03-18 18:24:00,2073,That would be EARLY 70s...................
1079248,misfish,2022-03-18 19:31:00,29133,"Late 70,s early 80,s. Back then,3 could dine on a dime. LOL "
1079276,SirCranksalot,2022-03-20 01:41:00,3291,"Thx. I didn't know there was such a thing as lead wrap. I know a guy who was doing some DIY bugs and he was using copper wire, I think. I assumed that you had used it as well. I am guessing that tungsten heads are used mainly to get them to sink faster."
1079902,SirCranksalot,2022-04-23 02:28:00,3291,been out to the river yet? It has dropped a lot and cleared quite a bit too.
1078727,misfish,2022-02-19 15:13:00,29133,I do not add bait to my stuff. I tie them so I do not have too. 
1078729,akaShag,2022-02-19 15:49:00,2073,"It was this part that made me ask the question.¬† I DID think that you were fishing the bugs bare, then I saw the word maggot. Doug"
1078731,misfish,2022-02-19 16:57:00,29133,"One is a maggot the other blood worm. Can not stay long,got another order to fill. LOL "
1078735,akaShag,2022-02-19 18:09:00,2073,Please tie more of the reds and check your e-mail. üòâ Doug
1078796,fishon64,2022-02-23 17:57:00,15,Do you have any left for purchase?
1078798,SirCranksalot,2022-02-23 18:02:00,3291,Will your online catalog be up and running soon?
1078802,misfish,2022-02-23 18:25:00,29133,PM sent
1078803,misfish,2022-02-23 18:26:00,29133,It would seem word of mouth and some posting is working just fine bud.
1078804,SirCranksalot,2022-02-23 18:39:00,3291,Jes joshin widya---that's all!!üòÅ
1078805,misfish,2022-02-23 18:41:00,29133,"I am looking forward to putting out a new high hook perch fly next season. It has been proving to be doing well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, "
1078806,akaShag,2022-02-23 18:44:00,2073,Perch season isn't done yet!!!
1078950,SirCranksalot,2022-03-03 16:26:00,3291,"Well, I have tried those bugs a couple of times for lakers. First time I went with great expectations hoping to catch that 15, going on 20, lb one that my bud caught 2 weeks ago. Not a nibble. My bud had his tipped with a full minnow so I tried that as well as bare bug. I have let it sit on the bottom and jigged(jug?) it sometimes. Not a nibble on Tue either.¬† A few tips, maybe?? If I don't catch anything, or at least get a nibble, on the next couple of tries I am going to have to return them for my money back guarantee!!üòÅ"
1078951,akaShag,2022-03-03 16:29:00,2073,"Are you using it as a dropper, or your main lure?¬† I think the effectiveness of a dropper is sometimes a fish wants a snack, not a meal.¬† The bottom lure catches their attention, and the bug gets the bite."
1078952,misfish,2022-03-03 16:31:00,29133,"Maybe your friend lucked out, they are perch baits after all.LOL"
1078975,SirCranksalot,2022-03-04 00:43:00,3291,"Maybe. I first heard of a Simcoe bug about 3 weeks ago when a guy on another site(LSO) who lives near Haliburton posted pix of good sized lakers that he caught on a bug. That's why I tried to find out more about them. We were fishing 60-80 ft so it was taking forever to sink, even with braid. When it finally reached the bottom it was so light I could not feel it so I added a sinker about a ft or so up. That may have ruined the action. This guy apparently uses very light line---4 lb----to catch good sized lakers. Takes finesse, I guess.  In Muskoka my bud also caught a 4 1/2 lb laker on the same bug earlier in the day, so not a fluke I guess."
1078976,SirCranksalot,2022-03-04 00:48:00,3291,"Thx, but I don't really understand what you are describing.¬† I am not sure what you mean by a dropper in this case. Are you saying that you use a lure or minnow at the end of the line and a bug further up?"
1078980,akaShag,2022-03-04 01:18:00,2073,"Exactly.¬† Misfish posted a link to a video of a guy showing the set-up.¬† If I can find that reply I will re-post it here.¬† But basically your fly is like a drop-shot rig, with a heavier lure a foot or so below it.¬† For Simcoe, maybe a Meegs with an ice bug up 18 inches kind of thing for lakers and whities."
1078981,akaShag,2022-03-04 01:23:00,2073,Here is that post: 
1078987,misfish,2022-03-04 08:50:00,29133,
1078989,SirCranksalot,2022-03-04 13:17:00,3291,Thx Brian. I have used a drop shot rig on other occasions/situations with just a sinker on the end. I just was not sure what akaShag was describing. He has now clarified. thx to both of you. I might give those Meegs a try as well.
1078993,misfish,2022-03-04 17:01:00,29133,"White tubes and swim baits dead stick. Same as Simcoe. If your using a finder that is. Once you see one coming up for the bait,start reeling til it smashes the bait."
1079029,SirCranksalot,2022-03-07 14:03:00,3291,"So you are suggesting tube/swimbait on a dropshot on a dead stick? With my set-up my dead stick is usually 30-50 ft away.  I did a bit more 'research' and I think my odds are against me. The fish we usually catch have white flesh which means, as I understand it, that they are eating other fish rather than bugs or crustaceans. The guy on the other site who catches them in H'burton seems to catch mostly orange colored lakers."
1079030,akaShag,2022-03-07 14:11:00,2073,"That has definitely been my experience as well, wrt colour of flesh.¬† But it is still worth putting a snack out there for the greys, and if you are fishing a lake where both lakers and whitefish are present, you may well catch a bonus whitie on the fly. Doug"
1079031,SirCranksalot,2022-03-07 14:17:00,3291,"Yeah, worth a try. Like the times you say to yourself--""Ah, I'm tired of eating fish. Maybe I'll snack on a few bugs"" I am sure we all have had that thought, eh.¬†üòâ"
1079035,misfish,2022-03-07 17:49:00,29133,"Nope. Your tube or swim bait is your main bait,bottom of the line."
1078334,misfish,2022-01-25 15:56:00,29133,"I tied these up, not many. Wanted to get some feed back if they would sell. I would charge 2 for $5. They are weighted. Lead wraps and bead.      "
1078338,misfish,2022-01-25 18:43:00,29133,Would seem they are worth it. Bought out. Order for more. LOL

1078370,Rizzo,2022-01-28 23:51:00,4754,"amazing! And some of the math here makes me laugh. No lying, I have literally seen stores advertising $3 each or 3 for $10...I told them I will take 3 but want to pay for each separately"
1078378,Big Cliff,2022-01-29 15:50:00,6899,"Can you make some up with a white body (similar to lawn grubs) (the smaller the better)¬† if so, I would be interested in 8 of them."

1078493,misfish,2022-02-05 21:42:00,29133,It is the least I can do SIR. I hope you catch many a perch with them. Please post pics when you do.  Tight lines Cliff.
1078499,SirCranksalot,2022-02-06 00:50:00,3291,If I buy some and I don't catch fish can I get my $$ back?üòÅ

1078537,Big Cliff,2022-02-10 01:05:00,6899,"Went out yesterday, boy was the fishing ever slow, we did manage a herring and some small perch, all but one was taken on my new favorite ice bugs. Thank you so much Brian these are amazing üòä"
1078709,SirCranksalot,2022-02-18 15:28:00,3291,A friend caught this on a Simcoe bug on Wed. Can't wait to try my Misfish specials!!(His actual smile much bigger than the one shown) 
1078725,akaShag,2022-02-19 13:36:00,2073,"So you are fishing those with a maggot on them?¬† Have you tried a perch eyeball? (and yes, folks, it IS legal to use a perch eyeball for bait here in Ontario.) Doug"
