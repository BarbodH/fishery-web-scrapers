1080207,Rizzo,2022-05-13 13:04:00,4754,"Help me out. Have listed a couple things on Facebook Marketplace. You get a ton of people asking ""Is it still available?"". When you say it is, they don't respond. Were they hoping it was not available? Why do people do this - are they so lonely they just want someone to speak to them? Even if the response is a simple ""yes""? Or is there something deeper going on here? If you are one of the losers who asks if it's available, and then never responds once you know it is, please shed some light on your rationale."
1080209,LostAnotherOne,2022-05-13 13:53:00,956,I get it all the time.  The worst is when they ask for measurements of whatever I’m selling.  I send them the measurements then hear nothing back.  I don’t bother anymore.
1080211,BillM,2022-05-13 14:28:00,17367,People are probably hitting the pre-filled reply button by mistake.  Just a thought.
1080212,Terry,2022-05-13 14:29:00,14456,"Yup they do it all the time doesn’t matter if you posted it 30 seconds before , they still ask if it’s still available kijiji and other sell sites are the same too"
1080220,porkpie,2022-05-13 21:57:00,2521,This.  I believe I’ve done it by accident also.  Sorry if I ruined your day
1080221,ketchenany,2022-05-13 22:21:00,3229,It had people on Kijiji ask for  phone number and never called. Had one buyer actually pay me $10 more than asking because I held it for him.  	probably sold my phone number to some duct cleaner.
1080222,Terry,2022-05-13 22:58:00,14456,Yeah and sone want your address without asking to see it i now make them give me their phone number and tell them I will call them the day they want to see it and give my address I have heard of people getting the address and stealing it that night
1080238,John Bacon,2022-05-15 00:11:00,3277,I had a  guy ask if something he had already bought from me was still available. 
1080242,Rizzo,2022-05-15 01:56:00,4754,hoping you had a second one?
1080249,glen,2022-05-15 12:04:00,2641,Buy and sell wasn’t like this before the internet.  I used to buy and sell a lot. Now it’s a pain so hardly ever.   	part of it has to be people trying to buy and resell.  So they want it cheap as possible.
1080250,Rizzo,2022-05-15 12:45:00,4754,"yes there is a lot of that going on. I put a 9.9 Johnson on Marketplace for $875, whole bunch of ""will you take $500 for it"". Pretty sure those people just plan to turn around and sell it again. Because if they wanted it for themselves they would improve the offer after getting their lowball declined"
1080251,gordy28,2022-05-15 13:18:00,638,"Yup.  Facebook recently changed the button placement which has improved it slightly but I know I have been guilty of this embarrassing when some replies yes this $200,000 RV is still available"
1080256,misfish,2022-05-15 23:22:00,29133,"You have a 9.9 ? I did a ask,if still have. Took a bit for reply,but looking at a truck cap tomorrow. Nothing great,but it,s a cap. LOL "
1080258,Rizzo,2022-05-16 00:47:00,4754,had a 9.9. I wanted a tinny but already had a motor (8 hp nissan). The guy would only sell me the tinny I wanted if I bought his motor too. So I did. Of course then it becomes my problem to sell the 9.9 not his!
