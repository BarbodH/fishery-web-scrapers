1079824,GBW,2022-04-15 22:14:00,8460,Me too and I look forward to hunting for them and all other items Mother Nature provides out at my new place in a¬† week. 
1079826,smitty55,2022-04-16 02:47:00,928,That too for sure. I have 3 or 4 spots out this way where I pick. I make this fabulous leek and fiddlehead cream soup that is to die for. Also has mushrooms and green onions in it. Supposedly it came from an old Harrowsmith article but I've never been able to find it. It's called Wild Country Cream Soup. I may have shared it here in the past but not sure. Down to my last 3 logs of leek butter too so I'm just going to make it till mid May. Dougie did you end up making some last year?

Lol. I need a fresh feed of morels is what I am craving and stock up the freezer. To me they're better than steak."
1079858,akaShag,2022-04-20 00:58:00,2073,"Yep, not sure if I have one tub left in the freezer or not.¬† We had two inches of snow today (and so did you, probably) and I have not even looked to see if the ramps are out and about yet. Doug"
1079861,smitty55,2022-04-20 05:22:00,928,You can be sure they're up down your way. Right now they are basically the only green in the bush so easy to spot.

1080113,Fisherman,2022-05-09 00:54:00,7201,"Went and checked the leek patch on thursday, they're up but need a bit more heat to plump up the bulbs.¬† Picked a few and roasted them with oil in the oven, mixed with pasta and left over chicken and mushroom,¬† yum."
1080123,smitty55,2022-05-09 17:34:00,928,"Yea mine here are just barely starting to swell a bit, it will be a while yet before main pick but still getting the odd treat fresh dipped in salt. The soil is very dry and will slow down growth without any rain in the near future. I've never tried them roasted like that, I'll have to try that tonight with steak. "
1080214,Fisherman,2022-05-13 14:39:00,7201,"Back out this morning for a look, found a nice patch with bigger bulbs, got a grocery bag full.¬† I would estimate another 10 days or so and then it will be high time to pick."
1080234,Sinker,2022-05-14 16:21:00,8692,"Man, its so dry nothing is really doing well. My morels are up, but far and few betwen and very small. They are drying up. I don't know if I should let them go a few more days, or pick them before they are dehydrated lol. Its not looking good.  S."
1080239,akaShag,2022-05-15 00:15:00,2073,and the crappies are not on either!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!üòê
