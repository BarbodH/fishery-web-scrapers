But I’m hearing the hoses deteriorate with time. Can someone guide me through the process, please. . I guess I need to cut one end of the new hose off. How does one get the air out of the line? 	Many thanks."

1080166,irishfield,2022-05-11 02:50:00,26272,"Is it leaking? Is it sucking air? Is the fuel hose hard and no longer pliable? Is the bulb hard or can you still squeeze the bulb just fine to prime? If the answer is No, No, No and No I can prime it just fine, then you are wasting your money and time."
1080167,captpierre,2022-05-11 12:45:00,2521,It’s No to all. But I’ve heard so many stories about the hoses deteriorating with time and lining material getting into engine. I store with stabilized Shell premium in fall but use regular gas during the season.  You don’t think it’s wise to change out the hose after 15 yrs?
