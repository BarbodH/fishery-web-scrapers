Is there anywhere in nearby, or in Whitby, that anyone would suggest that offers good bullhead action?  Thanks in advance for any tips that might be sent my way."

801675,northernpike56,2013-08-04 21:51:00,717,"although, thats not too close, but you can catch well over 200 there in a day- one time I saw this guy who kept asking me to take the bullhead I was catching, so eventually I started putting them in his bucket (one of those huge white construction ones, it had a cover on it, so I lifted it off and it was legit full of 3-400 bullhead, no water or nothing, it was the funniest thing I've seen there."
