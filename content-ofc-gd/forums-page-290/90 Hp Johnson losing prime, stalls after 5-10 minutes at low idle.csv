At trolling speeds, your burning more oil than you really need, so it tends to gum things up, and cause problems down the road. Seafoam really helps with carbon build up in two strokes. I swear by the stuff.  S."
801134,bare foot wader,2013-07-31 19:34:00,1354,"yep, I run seafoam in every tank, a full can if I'm filling the tank from almost empty...otherwise eyeball half or a quarter can accordingly  you could try a trolling plate or pulling a small drift sock (or bucket) to slow you down...but that affects your steering a bit, I've tried running a small sock under the bow, tied from the two front cleats, this seems to work better with steering control but you need to have it centered below the hull which can be tricky and if you're in a heavy chop your the bow will take a pounding  sinker explained it better than me....at slow speed there is too much oil added to the mix...my local shop explained it all to me, but I'm not mechanic smart enough to explain it back...lol"
801153,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-31 21:29:00,10439,If you add some Mercury Quickclean to your fuel it will take care of the carbon build up issue.  With my old 90hp 2 stroke I would have to hit neutral every once in a while and give the engine a rev with the high idle lever for a few seconds to clean out the plugs because they do load up and start to foul at trolling speeds.  I also kept a few spare spark plugs in the boat just in case I fouled the plugs.

I had a similar issue with the priming bulb not staying firm with my 2 stroke 30 HP Johnson resulting in stall-outs and tough restarts.  Replaced the line and bulb, same issue, replaced the molex connectors at both ends of the line and the problem went away.  I assume there are o-rings in there that eventually wear out.  Just something to try if you didn't get new connectors when you did the fuel line change."

800299,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-27 02:45:00,10439,They do look a little fouled. Has it been run only @ idle or have you run it mid to high throttle? It could be a flooding issue if the float is stuck or you have varnish built up on the needle and seat.  Have you run any Seafoam through it?
800300,Doctrt,2013-07-27 02:48:00,141,TCW-3 and Shell V-Power.

800307,Sinker,2013-07-27 03:04:00,8692,"Yeah, a good dose of seafoam should clear that up....  S."
800309,Doctrt,2013-07-27 03:08:00,141,Do you really think that would do it?  Does it not need to be rebuilt?
800310,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-27 03:17:00,10439,Best to try before you go out and spend all the $$$ to have the carbs rebuilt. My guess is you have more than one carb. My old 90 Merc has 3 carbs. Gets kind of spendy to have 3 carbs rebuilt and synced. Especially when a gallon of gas and $14 worth of Seafoam may fix the problem.
800311,dhickey,2013-07-27 03:20:00,1038,Another option is to take the carb(s) off and soak it in fresh gas for about 24hrs then use carb cleaner to do a final cleaning and let it soak in for about 4hrs then hit it again with the cab cleaner. Wash it out with clean gas and install it . If that doesn't help than bite the bullet and get it (them)rebuilt.
800313,Doctrt,2013-07-27 03:26:00,141,Sounds like a plan.  I guess it can't hurt.  How much do you figure to have the carb(s) rebuilt?    How complicated is it to take off the carb(s)?
800314,dhickey,2013-07-27 03:44:00,1038,Honestly if you have to ask that then don't do it. They would have to be cleaned /rebuilt and synchronized.  $$$ A good marine mechanic can do it in a day 8-10 hrs.
800316,Doctrt,2013-07-27 03:51:00,141,Good advice.  I've done a smaller engine before but this ones a little more important.  Thx
800318,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-27 03:54:00,10439,The difficult part is the syncing. You need the proper tools to do the job.
800720,LesCulpJr,2013-07-29 15:32:00,75,"Wow you've been all over the map here haven't you:) I work at a johnson/evinrude dealer part time and deal with these engines on a weekly basis.  First of all this is not an oil issue or a plug fouling one.  You have a fuel issue  Going back to your intial post. If after your engine dies you go back to the motor and the fuel bulb is FLAT or almost there. You have a venting issue. If I miss read that part of your post, my apologies... If your fuel bulb looks normal but you have to pump it up to keep running then you have an air leak in your system. Replace your fuel line (don't buy an Attwood replacement fuel line)  You also gave mention to the fact that you tried a remote tank and experienced the same stalling problem... It could be that you have more than one problem here but they are all fuel related.  How long was the motor in storage before you bought it and was it stored properly? If you cannot answer this have the carbs serviced and sync'd. While they're at it have your mechanic test the VRO pump and ensure its working properly. This is a part that will fail over time. The quick and economical choice being to replace the VRO with an older style fuel pump and mix your gas from then on.  To keep an eye on your VRO simply observe the oil level in the res. from time to time and make sure its using oil.  Thats about all the advice I can give without having one of our mechanics look at it....  Keep in mind that gas today is only good for about 60 days after purchase. Always a good idea to stabilize your fuel if the boat sits around for any length of time between outtings... If by chance your motor was stored with untreated fuel you could have a bit of a mess in there.  If you are to try an do these repairs yourself please be confident that you can put them back together again:) lol. I know our marina has started turning people away that come in with handfuls or boxes of parts and who bring in obsolete equipment And we know others are doing the same. We just can't devote the time to it and feel bad charging so much on equipment that simply isn't worth fixing. That said.... You have a good motor there if you spend the money on it to have it fixed properly"

800771,aplumma,2013-07-29 20:15:00,6896,We are still at the point that the carbs need to be cleaned and adjusted. A properly working float in the carb will allow gas to be pumped via the bulb and get hard without fuel running down the outside of the carb. It has a overflow vent that is visible from the front of the carbs after you remove the flame suppressor from the front. You can run seafoam or 2/4 but it will not get rid of a piece of debris or a damaged needle and seat on the float. Once an issue is identified fix that issue before you look for a possible issue to cure a problem. Fixing them one by one usually results in less wrong diagnosis and snowballing the path to repair with assumptions.   Art
801066,Doctrt,2013-07-31 04:20:00,141,"Quick update.  Fuel lines were all replaced as was the bulb (apparently it was the wrong size)..  The mechanic felt that the carb was fine.  I'm not sure how he came to that conclusion.  It could be that he's trying all of the cheaper fixes first which I appreciate, but at the end of the day, I just want it fixed.  I did run the seafoam shock method prior to bringing it back in, but with no change.  The fuel pump was serviced, whatever that means and he felt there was a problem with the oil pump as well so that was also serviced.  I know I'm not giving much detail but I don't have the work order yet.  Long story short, it's working a thousand times better.  I ran it wide open, no change.  Still hauls.  At a slow troll it ran without stalling for about 10 minutes on three separate occasions before I opened it up.  It seemed to want to stall but it didn't.  It shuddered a bit, almost like it was misfiring but didn't let go.  When I felt the bulb, it was not close to hard, but when I pumped it, it no longer flooded out and stalled.  I was told not to expect the bulb to be completely taut when running, but im still not sure about this.  I didn't have a ton of time to run it but it seems that I'm almost there.  I think I'm going to clean up the plugs before we head out this weekend in the hopes the misfiring/shuddering is resolved.  I'll run it much more over the weekend and give it a real workout.  At least I'm more confident that I won't be stuck out in the middle of the lake.  Thanks a million for all the great suggestions and help.  It's a real tribute to how great this site really is. T"

799019,Doctrt,2013-07-19 19:39:00,141,"I've been having trouble with my 2000 90hp Johnson outboard.  When I bought it, it would barely start, and seemed to not be getting enough fuel.  A remote tank proved unsuccessful, so a new fuel pump was put in.  This solved about 50% of my issues as it would start and run moderately well although it would stall at any speed after a while.  We replaced every tube/line up to the fuel filter and including the fuel filter with no success.  It was then that I realized that he was running 50:1 fuel, thinking that the oil injection on the motor wasn't working.  Turns out, with all the starting and running that we had done, the oil in the tank was dropping, so it must have been working, resulting in a fuel mixture that was far too rich.  I plugged the oil tank and continued to run 50:1 to ensure a proper mix.  I then ran sea foam and other cleaners through the motor including a evinrude specific carb cleaner to clean up any excess gunk.  Now I've got it running at about 90%.  It jumps off the start and really flies (about 70km/hr) at top speed.  The only problem that persists is that it stalls at a low idle after about 5-10 minutes.  I can usually save it by pumping the ball once or twice, but it is always flat.  In fact, before it stalls, I can usually hear what I believe to be the fuel pump ticking as it searches for fuel.  I'm at a loss now and searching for answers.  Any suggestions?  Thanks a mil. Tim"
799020,jedimaster,2013-07-19 19:42:00,3472,Try having the fuel primer ball and cable hanging vertical with the flow pointing up.

799040,aplumma,2013-07-19 20:47:00,6896,You are describing a restriction in the low  speed and full throttle circuits of the carb. Carb cleaner are rarely able to clear debris from the passages if it is varnish then it can be dissolved. Once you get to around 20% throttle your midrange circuit feeds in and supplies fuel as needed till the full throttle comes into play. The issues you are having both on the bottom and the top of the carb. circuits indicates the midrange circuit is not getting the help it needs from the metering circuits idle and top end. The rule on carb's are clean them once then clean them again then put them back on the engine. If you are not comfortable tearing down the carb's then take it to a shop there are ports and passages that if enlarged or misunderstood as to how they work can be a waste of your time or damage the carb.  Art
799042,Doctrt,2013-07-19 20:57:00,141,We did run a remote tank with working primer bulb and lines with no change so I think we've ruled out anything in front of the carb.
799044,Doctrt,2013-07-19 21:05:00,141,"Thanks for the response.  I'm not exactly understanding the beginning however.  I had said that anything above the slightest idle seems fine although the boats speed does gradually slow down at a fast idle.  No stalling.  I don't find this at full throttle.  Everything seems fine, in fact it hums.  I do think that ultimately the carb will need to be cleaned and or rebuilt but would debris or varnishing not affect the top end of throttle, as it seems unchanged?  Furthermore, would is affect the bulbs ability to stay hard?  Would you happen to know anyone in the Whitby area that could do this type of work?  Thanks so much for the great responses. T"
799087,aplumma,2013-07-19 23:02:00,6896,"The idle circuit is just a small port that uses a fixed restrictor orifice with the air metered thru a passageway debris will only effect no throttle condition. The movement of the butterfly throat is the addition of air across a pilot jet that interacts with the needle valve. Any restriction of the pilot jet or the needle will allow  the fuel/air mixture to change usually leaning it out will stumble on first part of acceleration. The top end is either part of the mid range orifice or a stand alone opening depending on the design. As you open the throttle you create more vacuum and more room between the needle and jet so it is less sensitive to debris. A soft bulb usually indicates either the balls check valve is bad, air leak on hose including the pick up on the tank, or fuel pump not keeping up with the demand. Carbs are different from one design to another and I am speaking in broad strokes here but most engines that run poorly it is the first place to look when issues appear after verifying Spark, Air, and fuel delivery system.

799133,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-20 02:47:00,10439,To me this sounds like a vacuum issue. At idle there is not enough vacuum to operate the fuel pump properly. I would start off by checking the vacuum line that connects the fuel pump to engine. If it's OK it could be a leak in another vacuum line somewhere. It's possible that there is a gasket leak somewhere as well.  Could also be a defective fuel pump.  Might be worth the $$$ to have your local mechanic diagnose the issue and then you could either fix it yourself or get him to do it.

Turned out the plugs were wrong and the mechanic felt I should reconnect the oil injection and run straight gas.  He 'cleaned out the fuel system' whatever that means, but to no avail.  It continued to stall when idling slowly.  After waiting a few days with it in their possession with no work having been done, and no work to be done on it over the weekend, I decided to at least bring it home and have it in the garage over the weekend.  So I decided to monkey around with it.  I think I may have cracked the code.  You guys let me know what you think.  It's clearly (to me) that it is a vacuum issue.  Fuel is being lost somewhere.  I popped the cover off and happened to be pumping the bulb when I noticed gas dribbling/spraying out of the carburator.  It could be that thus far, when I was looking at it the motor was fairly level, and not trimmed like I had it today, so I didn't notice this before.  I don't think is is normal and my suspicion is that I have either faulty check valves or a float in the carburator that is stuck open.  Does this seem likely?"
