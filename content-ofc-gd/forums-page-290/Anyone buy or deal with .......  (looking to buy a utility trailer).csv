801171,Entropy,2013-07-31 23:35:00,747,"I'm thinking about buying a 5 x 8 steel utility trailer from Trailer City in Manchester.  Anyone buy one there or deal with them?  Just looking for feed back.  Their 5 x 8 black painted steel utility trailer with 16"" sides and rear loading gate for $1600 + tax.  Is that a reasonable price for a new trailer of this kind?  I'm not looking to travel more than 1 hour to buy this type of trailer.  Thoughts?  Thanks, Entropy"

I'd love to save $200 to $400 bucks but the distance is a problem.  Thanks."

Buddy of mine just picked up a great deal on a 6 x10 landscape trailer,shopped around ended up saving about 4 hundred off list because the dealer had a huge inventory and wanted to move  one."
