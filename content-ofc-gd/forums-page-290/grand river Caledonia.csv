801242,harse77,2013-08-01 12:25:00,4,Hello fellow anglers. I am new to the forum and fairly new to fishing as well. Any advice for fishing the grand in the Caledonia area? I like to take my for year old daughter along so kid friendly spots would be best.

801266,harse77,2013-08-01 14:42:00,4,Thanks for the tip I'll let you know how it turns out.
801298,Garry2Rs,2013-08-01 18:30:00,1425,There is a village downstream from Caledonia called York. There is some sort of little park along the bank of the river just down from the bridge. It used to have lots of little small mouth and rock bass

801345,harse77,2013-08-01 22:02:00,4,Thanks for the tips. I tried by the dam downtown today and got a few bites. Next time I'll try York.
