801205,Richie Razor,2013-08-01 03:12:00,536,That's a real nice smallie. Great report
801206,Freshtrax,2013-08-01 03:16:00,2215,it was a nice fish about 3 and a half pounds...nowhere near as big as it looks in the pic.
801260,smitty55,2013-08-01 13:57:00,928,That's a bummer about your engine. At least you guys had a good time anyway. That's a neat looking quarry. Where is it located? Cheers
