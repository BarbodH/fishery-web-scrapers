We are heading up next saturday for a week and I am excited to get going! Any tips on color, patterns, spots, bait, depth, etc are all gratefully accepted.   Thanks,  Chris"

According to him, a jig and a minnow will keep the fish biting all day! Colour doesn't matter, it's all minnow all the time. HH"

Jigging works if you land on a school of course, but I would suggest covering water along points. Once you find a place where you are getting consistent bites every pass then drop down and jig. Once it slows down at that spot again repeat the process."
