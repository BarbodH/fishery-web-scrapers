801620,ctered,2013-08-04 13:41:00,40,The heat shields that cover the burners on my BBQ are all rusting and falling apart. At $20 a piece and needing 5 of them it will be pricey. I was wondering about making them out of aluminum. I have 1/4 aluminum 5 inches wide that I would be using. Does anyone see a problem using aluminum instead of steel or stainless.  Thanks Mark

801630,John Bacon,2013-08-04 15:32:00,3277,You may be able to buy an aftermarket single piece stainless one for the barbeque.  I think I paid about $25 for one a few years ago and I am still using it.

801638,misfish,2013-08-04 17:01:00,29133, Did mine as well Randy. Nice to work in a shop.   As for aluminum. To many toxics for my liking.
801663,ctered,2013-08-04 20:50:00,40,OK. Thanks for the input. I looked on ebay and have found 4 for $20 which is a lot better than $20 each here.
