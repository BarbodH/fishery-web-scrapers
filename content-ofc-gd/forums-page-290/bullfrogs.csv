801334,millerman,2013-08-01 21:27:00,29,hey every one i was jst wondering dose any one know of any places around or in mississauga that you can catch bull frogs i want to use them for bait for big bass and i also heard they taste good th u in advance 
801337,Richie Razor,2013-08-01 21:48:00,536,"Personally I find the fake frogs they sell work just as good if not better - River2Sea, Booya, LiveTarget, even berkley make lifelike frog imitations that will catch bass and you'll forgoe the catching, keeping them alive on a hot day, and piercing them with a hook......which is the worst part imo - lol"
801339,aplumma,2013-08-01 21:50:00,6896,Live target frog or mouse gets me all the bass I want without the hassle.   Art
801340,cram,2013-08-01 21:51:00,1733,Agree on the fake versions.  You'll find they're more effective and more durable.
801346,Christopheraaron,2013-08-01 22:10:00,3525,"That's pretty illegal, only leopard frogs can be used as bait."
801347,SirWhite,2013-08-01 22:20:00,210,You should probably just learn how to use a topwater bait. Frogs should really be left alone. They aren't as plentiful as they used to be.
801370,Freshtrax,2013-08-02 01:43:00,2215,I'll still use the odd leopard frog off the dock at night.....usually catches the biggest bass of the weekend ... I usually only catch one or two to use.
801382,sofabed,2013-08-02 03:06:00,119,I may be wrong about this but I don't think you can fish with any type of live frog anymore
801383,Freshtrax,2013-08-02 03:16:00,2215,Just can't buy them or sell them
801394,Cudz,2013-08-02 04:15:00,2652,"Yes, I believe you are allowed to use leopard frogs as long as you catch them yourself. I believe you may have 12 in posession."
801398,Woodsman,2013-08-02 04:51:00,1286,X2 Northern leopard frogs are the only allowed frogs. Limit if 12. Pg. 10 of the current Regulations Summary.
801403,aplumma,2013-08-02 10:55:00,6896,If I catch 12 frogs they ain't going into no basses stomach.....Thats some good eating right there. I also have the same problem when I find crawfish too.  Art
801417,Rod Caster,2013-08-02 13:03:00,5784,"I'd be in the same position. Looking at my bait bucket, looking at my butter, looking at bait bucket, looking at cast iron frying pan..."
801422,Beans,2013-08-02 14:04:00,3339,"I must be getting soft in my old age...last time I went to stick a frog on a hook, I just couldn't do it...those little eyes looking up at me..."
801527,fishindevil,2013-08-03 08:10:00,6254,Another question about an illegal thing to do !!! Why don't you read the regulations ......there have been a lot if these questions lately..... Grrrrrr
801532,Rich,2013-08-03 11:04:00,3927,"Hey guys, where is the best place to get some fishing grade TNT?"
801538,Christopheraaron,2013-08-03 12:31:00,3525,"Forget TNT rich, I believe a nuke is much more efficient"
801570,millerman,2013-08-03 20:20:00,29,man it was a question calm you nuts
801571,millerman,2013-08-03 20:21:00,29, plus i asked because the frogs were pretty much for eating but i figured were ever i can find bullfrogs i could find leopard frogs
801572,bare foot wader,2013-08-03 20:41:00,1354,"hmmm, so a new member asks a question and finds out it's illegal(he also mentioned eating them, which is legal)....isn't that a great function of these online forums? to educate  it's sometimes nice to pass along wisdom, rather than tearing a young guy a new crap hole...  only leopard frogs can be used as bait....but as for the eating question, bull frog legs taste great fried in butter or bbq'ed with your preferred sauce, comparable to a chicken wing kind of   Holders of a valid recreational fishing licence may catch and retain bullfrogs for personal use from July 21 - Oct. 15; the possession limit is 10.

801585,Rich,2013-08-03 21:49:00,3927,Nobody ran anybody over any coals..  The kid probably didn't know. Now he does. Problem solved.
