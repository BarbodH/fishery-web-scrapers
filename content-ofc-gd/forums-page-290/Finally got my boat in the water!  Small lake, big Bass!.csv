800681,ccmtcanada,2013-07-29 12:59:00,7971,"Since I do most of my fishing with Fishnsled, there hasn't been a need to get my boat out of the garage.  That finally changed over this month.  I stayed at a cottage on a tiny lake up in Muskoka over the past two weeks and managed to get out almost every morning I was there for a few hours to hunt down some bass.  There is no public boat launch on this lake, so I made a donation to a summer camp that is also on the lake and I was in business!  It wasn't really a launch....just a level entry into the lake on a beach that's hard packed sand.  Good enough for me!!   When I say this is a small lake...it's truly tiny!  When I open it up, I can get across the entire lake in about 30 seconds tops!  It's about 400 meters across and maybe a kilometer long.  It's quite deep....45 feet down the middle, but the bays come up to about 8 feet with lots of great weed beds.  I knew there had to be some bass in this lake!  Most fish were around the 1 to 2 pound range, but I did manage to pull a few really nice ones out of the lake.       I fished alone most days, so I had to take self pics...so they are not that great.  On one of my last days there, I tossed a senko rigged texas style out into the middle of a weed bed.  I didn't feel the hit, but my line suddenly took off shortly after it landed.  I set the hook and this big one took me by surprise!   I will have to make it a point to take my little boat out more often...  "

Nice to see you getting the dust off the rig Cliff and some nice fish as well.  Looks like a gem of a lake.  Look forward to hearing more about the vacation while fishing this weekend....from my boat.
800758,Bassassins,2013-07-29 18:08:00,111,Sounds like that donation was money well spent - can't beat a private lake with lots of BASS!
