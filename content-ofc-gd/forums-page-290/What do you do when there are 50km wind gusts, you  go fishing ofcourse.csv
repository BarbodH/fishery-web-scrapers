We had to get pretty close to shore but found some large and small mouth bass and some real big perch hitting spinnerbaitsit was another fun day on the water                 "

801568,Roy,2013-08-03 19:48:00,13728,"Water looks calm enough. Appears as though you two are having a good season. Thanks for sharing.  ps. Terry, nice shirt."
801569,misfish,2013-08-03 20:12:00,29133,"I figured since Terry wanted to take the pics today,I would leave the reporting to him.  Yup,was a good time as all our times on the water are. Was nice to share tourny stories on this body of water. Yours older then mine of course.  I wasnt really surprised at the slow bite,as there was a tourny on it the weekend before. Darn bass tournys.  Lots of sightings,but when we seen them,they seen us. Stupid us.LOL  Took only one big fish that I lost, to remind me what I did wrong . Yep,when you set the hook on a bigg,n.drive that rod in the water,to try and keep it from jumping an spitting the bait. Man wished I could of found them stinger hooks..   Dam it was a nice fish.  Im not sure why Terry wanted the full windshield though. He was still getting WET. LOL     Good to get out as always bud..   "
