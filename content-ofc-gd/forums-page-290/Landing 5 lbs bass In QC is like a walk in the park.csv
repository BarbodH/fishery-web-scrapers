WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!      the next mornning i felt bad.    so i put my poker face on and pulled out a pair of 3's  and won the world championship.  SMASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       Had a chance to fish with the old man, he was shooting his mouth about how bass fishing is SOoOoOoOo easy and that you can catch them with a beer bottle cap........  well, i should have believed him. WAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMO!          OH BOY after that was i ever tired.  Its hard working in quebec with all the effort i have to put up to catch these nickels.  "

801059,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-07-31 03:24:00,0,"i don't hold out the fish to make it look bigger.  i do it just like the way the pics look when the fish is nice and close with the angler in the background.  you can always tell how a big a bass is by the hand lipping them, and those are some sweet hawgs."
