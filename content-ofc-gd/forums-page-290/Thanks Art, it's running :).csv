801561,Bernie,2013-08-03 18:31:00,3190,"A couple weeks ago I posted in the ""wanted"" forum looking for an ignition coil for my old chainsaw. Art found a cross reference for the coil from another brand.Found one on Ebay and ordered it. The inner laminate for the coil wouldn't fit the saw, so I pulled the laminate out of the old one and installed it into the new one. Viola! Spark! I resurrected this saw from a back corner of the shop about 8 years ago. The rewind was messed up so a co worker seen me working on it and said he had one, It ran well for several years. Then the chain started to get tight/loose two years ago. The clutch gear was worn out. This happened at the end of the season. Found one on Ebay and put it on a year later. Went to use it and the old brute wouldn't start. ....No spark. Dang! Found a supposed good used one at a local repair shop in another town, but it didn't work either.So I just borrowed dads for last year. His is a fairly new modern one that cuts great and sounds like a bee when it runs, but I still preferred my old Farmsaw. Runs at a lower RPM, but it has gobs of torque, just pull the throttle and cut. My dad was always concerned that the old saw didn't run a chainbrake. I was chatting with an old friend that sold these things years ago. He said he thought he had one in his back room, brand new for a P40. He did and it fit nicely. I don't mind the color difference     "

801573,aplumma,2013-08-03 20:46:00,6896,I am glad that it worked I love the old machinery and have restored a few older engines in my time.   Art
801605,wormdunker,2013-08-04 10:25:00,1711,"Never heard of ""Farmsaw"" ?  Is that the manufacturer's name?   I have a Husquvarna 353 - awesome saw!"
801607,Bernie,2013-08-04 10:50:00,3190,"It's a Pioneer saw, ""Farmsaw"" was the model that was very close to the same as the  Pioneer P40. Pioneer was once a very popular brand and owned by OMC at one time. "
801611,Rod Caster,2013-08-04 12:12:00,5784,Sweet saw. Got me an echo 670 and it's a torque monster too. Very nice of Art to give you a hand!
801615,Sinker,2013-08-04 12:33:00,8692,"I love the old saws too. I have a couple old john deere machines that I've been meaning to rebuild, just never seem to find the time.  The stihl's get all the work done around here.  S."
