800985,Fish Farmer,2013-07-30 21:11:00,2234,"Nice looking boat, I checked them out at the show and the only thing I saw I didn't like was the transom in the well, I pointed it out to the salesman, there was a seam in the corner of the well that looked like it had an open spot that water could get in through a seam, he told me he hadn't had any complaints about water issues.  But other than that, I can't say anything. Maybe someone else has some info. Good luck in your venture."

801048,vance,2013-07-31 01:55:00,719,A friend of mine has had one for 7 years with no issues and I think that they are a nice boat.  vance
801249,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-01 13:22:00,1022,I had the pleasure of riding in Gerritt's Polar Kraft and had no complaints. Maybe he can chime in further.
