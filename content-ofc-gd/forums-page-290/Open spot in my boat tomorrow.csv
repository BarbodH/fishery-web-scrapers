I do quite a bit of casting, so even someone who wanted to do bass could come on board and do your wacky worms or senkos or whatever the heck you guys do. We would split costs from Kitchener. I've only fished St Clair once, so the day would involve some exploration of new waters, and I plan to fish a pretty good day. Leaving Kitchener around 5:30 am and not back until evening."
801056,Rizzo,2013-07-31 02:35:00,4754,....looks like I'm flying solo. Even if I have half the day we did last time I'll take it! Hopefully will have something to report
801061,Sinker,2013-07-31 03:37:00,8692,Good luck!  Did I mention I hate work......  S.
801180,Rizzo,2013-08-01 00:08:00,4754,"Well, not much to say. Did land a 38 and one feisty bass. Met a guy at the launch who had an unbelievable day yesterday, and he got 2 today. Thats musky fishing...when they are on hope that you are on the water!"
801271,landry,2013-08-01 15:00:00,1005,I went yesterday casting. It was awful. Lost one casting and got a smallish one trolling. It has been slow for me lately. Maybe next time. Landry
