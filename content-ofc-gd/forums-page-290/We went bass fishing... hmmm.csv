801343,Richie Razor,2013-08-01 21:56:00,536,Nice shots!!! You guys got the slop perch pattern down pat!!!

801357,wormdunker,2013-08-01 23:43:00,1711,Nice pix!  Thanx
801368,Bassassins,2013-08-02 01:19:00,111,Thanks Guys!    That is awesome to hear Sinker - we used tinypics before to upload all of our photos but for other reasons we started using imgur instead (cleaner pictures and super simple to do multiple photos at a time - we were recommended it by a friend) - pumped that it also fixed the other issue.  We had only heard from a couple of people they didn't work so I can't imagine how many people actually didn't see them.  Happy everyone can view things now!!!
