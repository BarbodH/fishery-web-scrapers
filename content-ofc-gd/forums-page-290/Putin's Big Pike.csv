800802,206,2013-07-29 22:46:00,563,Oh and i thought this was another fries and gravy thread
800804,kickingfrog,2013-07-29 22:57:00,8333,"Saw that, and apparently many are claiming it's a photo from a number of years ago despite what the government says. Who would have guessed that a politician who fishes would also be a liar?"
800830,bucktail,2013-07-30 01:17:00,1857,It is absolutely a 20kg pike .............................. I dont want to go to russian prison!
800838,jedimaster,2013-07-30 01:30:00,3472,Easily a 40kg pike..... checks over my shoulder for Russian mob...
800855,Skud,2013-07-30 02:15:00,739,"Not 40lbs but still a nice, well fed fatty."
800880,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-07-30 06:03:00,0,"in soviet russia, fish catches you!"
800918,Headhunter,2013-07-30 13:18:00,5703,"He probabaly stole the rod out of the hands of a fellow angler... Vlad believes that anything that gets handed to him, is his. ""Hey buddy, nice ring!"" HH"
800925,Musky or Specks,2013-07-30 15:11:00,2710,"Clip looks a lot like an old Red Fisher vid. Someone else catches the fish, hands rod to President."
801202,Dave Bailey,2013-08-01 02:35:00,1641,A pity it didn't latch on to his REMAINDER DELETED DUE TO DESIRE TO STAY NON-POLITICAL.  
801203,Richie Razor,2013-08-01 03:05:00,536,"At least he uses the 1950's pike hold, I'm thinking holding pike in that manner or by the eyes, will make a comeback, especially around the kawarthra's."
801230,Rich,2013-08-01 11:26:00,3927,30 second vid and 1.5 seconds of it was a pike in a net.  How would you have a clue how big it is?
