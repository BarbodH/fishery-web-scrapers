801187,Bill Shearer,2013-08-01 00:44:00,456,"Edit the things you don't like. You put them there, so remove them. Links to photos are easy"
801308,mercman,2013-08-01 19:07:00,7054,"I don't think its cause no one cares. I looked at the few threads you started, and you got good views on all of them. The ones in the photography section, generate less interest because not all of us are photographers, but all of us are anglers. Don't be so hard on yourself"
801322,aplumma,2013-08-01 20:12:00,6896,The posts can be edited to remove any portion that you have posted any content from others are there for our records. If you have a thread that is causing you grief such as inflammatory statements that you wish you hadn't started you can P.M. the Moderators and at our discretion we can make them invisible to the forum. We generally do not remove common posts that fail do to time constraints on our time available to moderate the board.  Cheers  Art
