801039,jedimaster,2013-07-31 01:07:00,3472,Just a heads up. The license plate renewals are going up as of sept 1 2013. If you need to renew this year do it before then. They are going up 8 dollars per year or 16 for two years.
801041,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-31 01:13:00,10439,"What will that put them up to Jedi? Haven't lived in Ontario for 7 1/2 years now.  Our plate in YK are $74/year for cars and trucks, $25/year for trailers, $50/year for the snowmobile..........................................  I have a truck, 3 trailers and a snowmobile for $200/year.  You still have plates for life on your trailers or are they charging yearly?"
801042,Fisherman,2013-07-31 01:15:00,7201,Mine went up about $50 already this year for a 3/4Ton.  Drivers licences also go up.
801043,jedimaster,2013-07-31 01:31:00,3472,Going from 82 to 90 per year for a car.
801055,Sinker,2013-07-31 02:25:00,8692,Trailer plates are still lifetime.
801065,Luke V.,2013-07-31 04:11:00,286,It just cost me 115 for my 3/4 ton truck last month Stupid weight laws
801217,PitViper,2013-08-01 05:27:00,33,Why does Ontario require front and rear plates? Seems as though we are the only province to have both.
801223,lew,2013-08-01 10:24:00,12766," At least we no longer have to replace the license plates like we used to. It'd be blue plates with white lettering one year, then we'd switch to white plates with blue letters the next.  Talk about a waste of resourses."
801225,ketchenany,2013-08-01 10:50:00,3229,"Paying for the overspending by the past government. It's not a tax, it's a service."
801241,Fisherman,2013-08-01 12:21:00,7201,That's so they can get ya coming and going..
801256,Richie Razor,2013-08-01 13:44:00,536,And what can we do about it??? Nothing. It's absolutely ridiculous what we put up with.
801279,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-08-01 15:49:00,535,Glad I got mine for 2 years in April.
801281,Joeytier,2013-08-01 16:08:00,3990,Northern ontario is about half the price...hopefully that doesnt change.
801299,Joey,2013-08-01 18:32:00,9122,"     Yup, they're in bed with the 407 ETR!"
