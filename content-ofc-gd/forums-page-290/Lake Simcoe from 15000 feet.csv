801304,mattybculp,2013-08-01 18:50:00,388,Very cool pic ! Its amazing how 15000 ft can make simcoe look like a flyin lake at 1000 ft.
801318,misfish,2013-08-01 20:07:00,29133,"I SEE TERRY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   Great shot."
801324,Roy,2013-08-01 20:15:00,13728,"Love those God shots. Hell, I can even see Brechin from there. And Canal Lake...."
801329,craigdritchie,2013-08-01 20:54:00,1586,"How about Waubushene from 2,000 feet?   Pre-fishing .... from a Cessna.  "
801335,mattyk,2013-08-01 21:39:00,2110,Very cool!
801338,Richie Razor,2013-08-01 21:49:00,536,"Nice shot, seems like there's no one living around the lake."
801358,kickingfrog,2013-08-01 23:59:00,8333,No backgrounds.
801372,Christopheraaron,2013-08-02 02:13:00,3525,"Hmmm, I believe that's georgian bay actually. Cool shot Joey!"
801374,woodenboater,2013-08-02 02:26:00,2277,"nope, GB is in the background beyond Simcoe."
801375,Joey,2013-08-02 02:33:00,9122,"Ya, I love the shot, I'll tell my Bro in law Hamish that you all liked it.  I'll tell him to take some more"
801376,woodenboater,2013-08-02 02:50:00,2277,Would be super cool if he flew over Lakair and the West Arm ! You should try and snag a ride on the next flight Joey
801379,Joey,2013-08-02 02:55:00,9122,"Hahahaha, he flies commercial, so I'd have to pay for a ticket somewhere."
801380,woodenboater,2013-08-02 02:57:00,2277,"yeah, co-pilot would probably wonder why you're in his/her seat lol"
801384,Joey,2013-08-02 03:31:00,9122,

801396,Christopheraaron,2013-08-02 04:27:00,3525,"That's what I'm saying, I don't see canal..."
801399,Roy,2013-08-02 05:23:00,13728,"Canal would be in the foreground, Christopher.....seek and ye shall find."
801400,irishfield,2013-08-02 05:44:00,26272,Man.. I can see my house from there!!  BTW.. the Lakair shots have been done by someone else in the past!!
801408,woodenboater,2013-08-02 12:01:00,2277,"yeah, Canal *should* be on the very edge at right but I can't see it "
801411,Moosebunk,2013-08-02 12:06:00,3970,"Lake Simcoe!?!?!?  Never heard of it.  Looks like a big lake though, any fish in it?  Thanks for posting.  I'll have to look it up."
801415,Terry,2013-08-02 12:41:00,14456,"don't bother, no gar in the lake  and too big in the winter for a bravo with a primer problem"
