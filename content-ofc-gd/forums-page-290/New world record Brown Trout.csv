Otwin Kandolf was fly fishing near a salmon farm on the Ohau B hydro canal on New Zealand’s South Island when he caught the fish of a lifetime – a 42-pound, 1 ounce brown trout. According to an article for Bay of Plenty Times, Kandolf thought he snagged bottom. “I called out [to my fishing partner], ‘I’m stuck, I’m stuck again’. And then I pulled and pulled and I could see my little red spinner coming up. I didn’t even see the fish at first but then I did and shouted ‘it’s on, it’s on’. He went back up the canal and I followed him up about 100m.” Though they had just a small net at their disposal, Kandolf managed to wade out in the water, put the fish’s head in the net, and push the massive fish up on the bank finally land it after 20 minutes of fighting. The 71-year-old angler caught the fish back on March 8, but it wasn’t until this past weekend before it was officially certified as the new world record. The old record belonged to Roger Hellen’s 41-pound, 8-ounce catch in 2010 out of Lake Michigan.

801120,BillM,2013-07-31 18:05:00,17367,Triploids shouldn't be considered for world records.  Look at that nasty mutant.
801124,Musky or Specks,2013-07-31 18:20:00,2710,I love how the IGFA gets all up in arms when it comes to chain of custody/scales when it comes to musky but sure trout hmmm don't catch many of those here so we don't care about it.
801129,Christopheraaron,2013-07-31 19:03:00,3525,"Wait a minute, he was fly fishing with a spinner?"
801135,bare foot wader,2013-07-31 19:38:00,1354," try swinging a tiny dick nite spoon...or a single colorado blade...especially when you come out west....you might like the results    they cast easier than huge intruders too   agreed on the triploid thing....those twin brothers on diefenbaker, all of those records rainbows are genetic mutants too?"
801136,kickingfrog,2013-07-31 19:44:00,8333,The hunchback of New Zealand.
801157,bucktail,2013-07-31 21:49:00,1857,Yes the Rainbows from Diefenbaker are all triplods as well and I also believe they should not count at all. Its becoming a joke with these fish.
801173,porkpie,2013-07-31 23:51:00,2521,Triploid definitely shouldn't count!
801174,fishinguypat,2013-07-31 23:54:00,547,"these triploids don't even look natural at all, there heads are more bloated and round"
801194,Rich,2013-08-01 01:32:00,3927,"Whether or not it should count in the books, that's still a massive brown!"
801196,cowanjo,2013-08-01 01:55:00,249,"I have fished tongariro and lake taupo in NZ fishing for browns, it is in my opinion one of the greatest places to fish for these with a fly. i hear the arguments but that is just a massive brown - they catch a huge number of browns in this area?. What a great fish - enjoy - I hope once and for all the musky record gets broken on GB and I am holding the net"
801200,Musky or Specks,2013-08-01 02:18:00,2710,It could be an 85 lb fish and Ramsell and company would still find a way to disqualify it
801201,MJL,2013-08-01 02:24:00,2427,"From what I gather, it’s not a triploid but rather a brown trout that hung around a salmon farm and fed on a constant supply of fish food for most of its’ life...  http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/enormous-new-zealand-brown-trout-possibly-a-world-record/  According to my friend who lives in New Zealand (for the past 5.5yrs), trout farming is illegal in New Zealand. You won’t find triploid trout or farmed trout there - At least not since the 70's or 80's.  I wouldn't mind something like that at the end of my line...At least for 1 hero shot"
801204,Richie Razor,2013-08-01 03:09:00,536,Triploid trout shouldn't count towards any record whatsoever. The brownie in question isn't a triploid but was smart enough to stick around and feed off an aquaculture pen..... Legit record? Perhaps....
801229,BillM,2013-08-01 11:23:00,17367,"If it's not a triploid, then more power to the guy that caught it.   Just by looking at it, it screams triploid to me."
801246,sauce,2013-08-01 12:47:00,219,My trip to NZ I spoke with quite a few locals. One of the tackle shops I visited I was told about these obese browns that live in hatchery outflows feeding on pellets and anything else they can fit in their mouths. This record fish is undoubtedly a hatchery fed wild brown.  Trout fishing in NZ is unique.  Trout are not native but have adapted well and become established in many lakes and rivers.  Many fish spend summers in cold streams and winter in warm lakes. It seems odd to be wading an ice cold stream in the middle of summer surrounded by palms and other tropical vegetation.  One spot i fished was the mouth of the Waititi river. Lake Rotorua reaches 20 celcius or warmer. Waititi stays cold and is loaded with trout all summer. Fish up to 5 pounds are common and a 10 pound resident brown or rainbow is always a possibility. Definitely a place to consider for a unique fishing trip.
