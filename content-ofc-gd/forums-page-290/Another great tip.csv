801546,kickingfrog,2013-08-03 13:23:00,8333,Saw this on Charlie Wray's show this morning.  Use some foam pipe wrap across the top of your full windshield boat when you've got the travel tarp on to help protect the tarp from wearing out.    Can't cost more than $3 with tax and I would think you could use it just about anywhere else you had some wear concerns.   Off to walk in the woods. Ryan thinks we're going for him. Truth be told he's my bird dog to see how the birds are.
801563,Terry,2013-08-03 19:18:00,14456,good idea
801575,aplumma,2013-08-03 20:50:00,6896,I have done it for years and never torn a tarp yet. I also put pieces on my trolling motor skeg and blades to keep them from tearing a hole in the tarp.   Art
801578,misfish,2013-08-03 21:05:00,29133,"Yup.old news,is new news.  How was the bird watching  Rob?"
801581,kickingfrog,2013-08-03 21:26:00,8333,Nothing. Although the raspberries were a hit.

801586,Rich,2013-08-03 21:51:00,3927,Pool noodles work too
801593,wormdunker,2013-08-04 01:26:00,1711,"Speaking of pool noodles, they work great to wrap pre tied worm harnesses & other baits."
801594,monterey guy,2013-08-04 01:56:00,12,pool noodles for worm harnesses i like that idea.
801831,SirCranksalot,2013-08-06 01:30:00,3291,I use foam pipe insul with a stick on the inside to prevent the foam from collapsing.
801833,Steve,2013-08-06 01:56:00,2075,"a small piece of a pool noodle can be also used when breaking down a wire rod (two piece rod). Just run the wire around it, splitting the two rod sections so that the wire doesn't kink."
