801427,Kawartha Kev,2013-08-02 14:34:00,281,Can anyone suggest a good cheap roofer that works in the Buckhorn area I need to get my cottage roof done. Its a simple A frame roof small with a couple of plumbing stacks I just want plain good shingles nothing fancy.  Thanks Kawartha Kev
801436,lew,2013-08-02 15:14:00,12766,Feeney Roofing from Ennismore is excellent with a reputation to match  705-743-7663
801449,captpierre,2013-08-02 16:23:00,2521,"I had Feeney do mine 2 yrs ago.  Took a long time to get the work started.  Didn't do a drip edge as specified.  Looks good and doesn't leak.  You will be offered ""Lifetime"" shingle for about 10-15% more.  I went with it.  We'll see.  The other guy we looked at was Heritage Roofing.  A simple A Frame I would likely tackle myself.  I had weird angles and skylights in mine.  Consider steel.  lasts longer and snow slides off.  Lots of cottagers going with steel"
801477,Kawartha Kev,2013-08-02 20:24:00,281,Thanks for the info guys wish I could do it myself but too much of a hassle with disposal etc. and I am not that great working on roofs I'll look up Feeney and see if they are interested I do need it done ASAP though so not sure what their schedule is. Thanks!!
