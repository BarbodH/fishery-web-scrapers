798144,NAW,2013-07-14 23:07:00,4022,"I am planning a trip to Manitoulin Island in for later this summer.  It will be my wife, and 10 month old son.  We're looking for a place to camp, rent a boat and fish an interior lake.  Does anyone have any suggestions to camp sites, or lakes that I should check out?  Any suggestions on ""must see"" attractions on the island would be good to!  Thanks in advanced!  Nick   Edit..  Small report added to the end!"
798147,Rod Caster,2013-07-14 23:18:00,5784,"The hideaway lodge is nice, with nice owners. ...but its on the big lake.. so....."
798148,Roy,2013-07-14 23:21:00,13728,"Take them to Lake Manitou and your son will forever be proud to say: When I was a kid, my dad took me to the largest fresh water lake on an island in freshwater in the world. The lake trout fishing is decent too."
798149,Raf,2013-07-14 23:22:00,3495,"I have a question, how did you get your wife to agree to camp with a 10mos old?"
798151,irishfield,2013-07-14 23:32:00,26272,"..and if you do take Roy's advise... you can stay at my sister-in-laws where you can get a camp site, or a cabin, as well as that boat rental. www.manitoulinresort.com"
798280,NAW,2013-07-15 19:13:00,4022,"With the wee man, I think I should stick to the small lakes!  Thanks for the info though  Sounds like a blast!  I've have to look into that a little more.  Thanks Roy!  We both love camping, and want to get the boy in to it at a very young age.  Actually, I'm surprised we've waited this long before taking him out.  It's just been a very bust summer that all!  That sounds prefect Wayne!!  Is there an OFC discount Thanks!"
798282,Spiel,2013-07-15 19:40:00,9065," I spent most of my teens years there (Hideaway Lodge, Kagawong), my parents best friends owned it after winning a lottery way back when.  Beautiful place in beautiful surroundings though they are but a memory these days, haven't been there since the mid 70's."
798352,irishfield,2013-07-16 02:24:00,26272,"Considering Leah and her youngest sister haven't talked now in about 3 years, they'd probably charge you double if you mention my name!"
798354,HTHM,2013-07-16 03:01:00,4082,They treated my family and I well when we were there.
798515,NAW,2013-07-17 01:29:00,4022,"Thanks again for the replies guys!  I looked at all of the places you recommended.  And a few that my wife found while doing some research.  We have it narrowed down to three.   But if you answer a few more questions, then I will have my final answer.  What kind of fish can I find in the lake.  And how hard are they to catch!  There are so many Lake Manitou's out there, it's tough to find confident answers.  It appears to hold Trout, bass and perch...  But I would love a pickerel dinner!  If there are some lakes that hold Walleye, I would be more inclined to camp there!  Thanks again for the advice so far.  Any additional help would be really great.  Nick"
798536,wall i,2013-07-17 03:09:00,48,I got my first posting as a banker in Gore Bay some 30 years ago. Fished the big water for salmon/trout mostly back when the fishing in Huron was at its peak. From what I recall walleye and perch could (perhaps still can) be had in Lake Mindemoya. Its a small inland lake in the center of the island.
798538,solopaddler,2013-07-17 04:00:00,8605,  Nick if walleye are your number one choice then I'd look at booking something in the north channel for sure.
798588,NAW,2013-07-17 19:04:00,4022,Thanks guys.  I'll keep hunting.  I'm possibly going to borrow a kayak for the week.  And maybe travel around and hit some smaller lakes.  Should be a good time.
801373,NAW,2013-08-02 02:21:00,4022,"We just returned this evening from from doing the big loop around Georgian Bay.  We took some OFC advice and stayed at the Mantoulin Resort.  Alex helping load the cooler!    We took the Ferry across.  That was a great experience.  Nice calm waters for my wife, who is not a fan of big boats.    It was our first time taking the young lad camping.  And things started out rough with a bruised cheek bone and bloody lip within the first 2 hours of being at the campsite!   He is 11 months, and learning to walk.  So lots of accidents waiting to happen.   I borrowed a kayak from a friend, and geared it up.  Due to little free time, and poor weather, my fishing was limited to about 2.5 hours this morning.  Managed a pike on my first cast!  But just scenery shots after that!...  I couldn't get out and explore due to the winds.  Manitou is a big lake, and can chop up good.  Still had a good time though!  And first time landing a fish in the kayak was a blast!    The Island is amazing.  I want to go back in a few years when Alex is older.  Some general shots of the ride.   Sorry there's not much fish porn....       "
801377,Rod Caster,2013-08-02 02:51:00,5784,"you should have put the photo of Alex walking near the kayak after the one where he is holding the beer.... hahaha  Nice scenery out there for sure, I intend to return many times myself"
801378,Joey,2013-08-02 02:54:00,9122,"Wow, great photos.  Looks like it was fun.  Glad your little guy was okay after the tumble.  It builds character"
801385,irishfield,2013-08-02 03:32:00,26272,"Good to see the ""Dutch couple"" are still in good shape... they originally came from Le-Ho-My on Big Bay Point Road ...that Leah's parents owned.  Hope you didn't tell that short little women who you knew... lol ...or you'd see the surcharge on your bill !"
801392,Cudz,2013-08-02 04:05:00,2652,As a teenager we used to stay here and I loved it.  Great smallmouth fishing right at the doorstep and lakers were pretty easy to catch as well. Great memories. http://www.manitoulin-island.com/mountainviewresort/  Edited: I posted this not realizing that you have already returned.  Sorry.  Looks like a good trip anyway.
801402,wormdunker,2013-08-02 10:45:00,1711,"Thanx for the pix, they are awesome!  Is Keystone light a REAL beer!!"
801412,Moosebunk,2013-08-02 12:10:00,3970,"Great first pic of Alex with the Keystone, the expression... he's like... ""GOLD!!!""   Cool shots."
801465,NAW,2013-08-02 18:40:00,4022,   Small world about the Dutch couple.   
801475,misfish,2013-08-02 20:15:00,29133,Nice trip bud. Pick yer brain sunday while were fishing.
