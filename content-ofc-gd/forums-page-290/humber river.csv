801483,Dave Bailey,2013-08-02 21:38:00,1641,"Saw a guy pull an eel out of there about twenty years ago. Not a lamprey, but a genuine Anguilla. He was fishing at the site of the old marina off South Kingsway."

Into August now, I highly doubt you'd find anything but bullheads.  They will run the humber in the spring, and every other dirty/shallow trib around."
