243129,MuskyBill,2008-08-25 06:36:00,311,"-91 the first try, but rebounded BIG with a +81 on the second..."
243132,Zubris21,2008-08-25 07:22:00,563,"now I know why I'm not a hunter.... third tried yielded a respectable 74, but I think I had it memorized by then"
243301,Leecher,2008-08-25 16:55:00,7832,Cool little test danbo....won't talk about my results   ....there's a reason why I hunt deer with my riffle
243304,danbo,2008-08-25 17:14:00,2646,"That's OK it's a teaching tool, but it aint perfect. The Running shot was cool."
243312,Canuck2fan,2008-08-25 17:49:00,1444,64 the first time although I know for a fact if the one deer that cost me 20 of those points had been stuck that fast and that many times it would have went down LOL. The second time I was very disappointed to only get 87.... When they said that the shots were ALL shots you SHOULDN'T attempt they were right. Talk about showing what not to do!!!
243339,cranks bait,2008-08-25 20:10:00,721,"As a brand new hunter (as of last week)  I have spent my entire afternoon on this.  The first couple of deer would have been venison hamburger for sure (if there was a way of collecting the scraps).  I'm now at a score average of 98.  I'm ready for the second week of hunt camp.  Just hope the deer are all lined up like the game and stay still, then I'm good to go!!!!"
243343,danbo,2008-08-25 20:22:00,2646,It's all about patience with a bow.  Wait for the very best shot or pass until next time.
243429,Leecher,2008-08-26 01:54:00,7832," danbo, do you hunt deer with a bow??  and what was your score if I may ask??"
243436,e-z-out,2008-08-26 02:37:00,1052,took 12 times but i hit 100 lol fun little game. I'll still to
243459,danbo,2008-08-26 07:52:00,2646,I used to bowhunt but haven't in years.
