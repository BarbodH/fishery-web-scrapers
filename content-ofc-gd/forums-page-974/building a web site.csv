I was talking about this to a friend in Thunder Bay and he pointed me in the direction of a web hosting site and when it all boiled down I could register our domain name for 2 years for about 75 dollars and get a web site hosted for 2 years for 92 dollars. This is in our budget area so I proceeded to try and get it started.  Once I got the domain name registered I had to try and build the site. My friend in Thunder Bay suggested doing the FTP thing. I guess this way you have to copy then paste the files  you want on your site.  It seemed easy to do until I watched the demo video that was on thesite I was going to put my web site on.  I was just playing with the site when the phone rang and it was the firm I had registered with, calling from Arizona asking me if I had any questions and needed any help, talk about good timing.  This fellow helped me work through some of the problems I was having and suggested that maybe I should have bought into a program they have that helps create the site through the use of templates. He checked the cost of it and it worked out to be 2 dollars cheaper than what I had signed up for.  So with the weather being crappy up here in Red Lake I spent most of my time playing around on this site and getting something going for the weekend.  When all was said and done, I got the site up, it looks ok but doesn't have all the information on it yet but at least I broadened my knowledge of the web and web site management.  If you have a cottage in the unorganized area of Northern Ontario and are unsure of the way the new Provincial Land Tax reform will affect your taxes, check out my site. it has a breakdown of what you can expect to pay in 2009 .

I have no idea how to build a website at all, other than very limited experience with the program dreamweaver.   I've been wanting to dabble into creating a website for some time, but never actually get the motivation for it.  Sounds like the company you hosted through is very helpful.  Great work!"
