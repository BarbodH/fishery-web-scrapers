243164,ccmtcanada,2008-08-25 11:55:00,7971,"Awesome report!  Your little guy looks right at home there with all those fish.  Looked like a great time, meeting great people and catching some beauty fish too."
243168,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-08-25 12:01:00,1362,What a great report!!!....looks like you and your son had a great fishing trip
243285,corvette1,2008-08-25 16:11:00,1765,awesome trip your son looks like he had a great time nice ride
243433,icefisherman,2008-08-26 02:15:00,952,"  Scuro,  every year I find lakers in Opeongo (those that are hungry) in the top 20-25 feet despite what everyone else may want you to believe. Most people think lakers are desp right now, and they are..BUT...those that are deep are of no interest to you anyways as they are just sitting there relaxing enjoying the view on the bottom, what ever lasy fish do ;-) The ones you should be interested in are those that go up in the water column to actively search for food. Those I was catching day in and day out.... One other thing that I found works great for me and most locals will not believe it ;-)...all of them are using those long lines with many spoons one after another...not sure what they are called but CT sales them...I go different way...just go and buy couple meps of Vinbrax lures in chartuse #3 and #4 and you are set.....cheap...and very successful. Always works and locals can not understand how come I get lakers next to them and they do not  Hope this helps, Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
243434,Nemo,2008-08-26 02:28:00,727,"Hey Ice,  Great report I was talking to a buddy of mine who was on Opeongo the same time. He was doing OK as well and concurs that the most were being taken in the 25 foot depth range.  One question was that Bass caught off the downrigger? Beauty fish great photos.  Thanks for sharing.  Nemo"
243439,icefisherman,2008-08-26 02:43:00,952," You've got it Nemo, the bass (and few other Bass) were caught on the riggers while trolling for lakers. I think I may have talked to your Buddy if he has a kid or two with him in a smaller boat? This year I got one more laker with tag by the MNR on it...the guy wasn;'t there when we were leaving on Saturday so I'll be emailing him the info.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
243443,Nemo,2008-08-26 03:02:00,727,Thanks for the info. He was in a 12 foot tinny with 4 stroke Merc. Did he have a dog? Two kids eldest boy and younger girl.  You know the fish are up high when you're catching Bass and Trout on the riggers.  I caught a few tags but always released them.  Nemo
243446,bigugli,2008-08-26 03:15:00,6138,The smiles on the kid's face say it all. I always got a bigger kick out of watching the kids catch fish. WTG dad
243491,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-26 12:57:00,0,"Great Report! Looks like you have those Lakers dialed in! And that bass is a monster!! You must have known right away it wasn't a laker and it must have fought really good! We've been seeing a lot of foxes lately. Apparently the mosquitoes are so bad this year, many animals are being driven out of the woods.  Anyways, good to see the little guy enjoying his trip and glad to hear you all had a great time. Thanks for sharing."
243520,b2kptbo,2008-08-26 14:04:00,1505,"Looked like a very good time, loved the pictures, thanks..."
243531,icefisherman,2008-08-26 14:32:00,952," That must have been him Nemo. It was small boat and yes there was dog in it too. We spoke briefly and he told me he has found the fish same place I was fishing them in the water column. I released the fish but kept the tag in my wallet and will be reporting it later today.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
242826,icefisherman,2008-08-24 14:33:00,952,"Well I am back from my annual camping/fishing trip up North. As usual tons of great time – this time we were three generations in the tent...great fishing both in Temagami and in Algonquin, the best weather so far this summer and memories for a life time... Here are few of those photo memories for your viewing pleasure: First some Temagami shots. It was nice seeing you again Wayne and Dan! Bit rainy the first couple days but that didn’t slow us down on the fishing front:   Weather got better, fishing did so as well...   What a beauty shot:   Our home for the trip – great tent, the best I’ve seen...not a drop of water inside and very compy third year and counting...   Here is the record for the trip laker. Not as big as last years 19Lbs 15 Onz but close as 11Lbs 7 Ozs  And here is a nice visitor, not too camera shy:  We were lucky enough this year to see: black bear (leaving Temagami on the Access road), muse, snakes, fox, deer with two baby deers, loonies, etc. After 6 days in Temagami onto the next leg – Algonquin park, Lake Opeongo: Our own private sandy beach with my fishing machine docked on it:   Got visitor during the night:   Few shots from our day trip to Proulx lake:    Some great Opengo fishing shots. Lakers and bass were waiting for us as usual:     Quality family time around the fire:  And another beauty shot for finale:   All in All great time was had by all! Trying to get back to speed on what is biting where but seems like couple Erie trips are in order as those eyes there have been hiding from me this summer and we ned to change that;-) Cheers and hope you liked the photo show! Ice Fisherman"
242831,Mike the Pike,2008-08-24 14:39:00,3421,Wow Emil that is an excellent report what a place What is that fat fish in the 14th pic your son holding it .a sheepy?  I love the shot of your boat with the sun setting in the background last pic.  Sounds like you had a great vacation .I have been off 2 weeks and the weather was much nicer
242832,BassMan11,2008-08-24 14:41:00,583,great pictures. nothing better then an anual fishing trip. Is that one fish the the little guy is holding up by the scale a bass? If it is that is a monster!!!

242847,icefisherman,2008-08-24 15:01:00,952,"Sorry guys, yes it is a BIG BASS on Opeongo. No sheapheads in Opengo Mike;-) My son had hard time holding it for me to take the shot with the right angle and it turned a bit dark...but it is Bass nevertheless. And that last picture and the rainbow one are my two favorites as well. Glad you liked them.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
242848,Leecher,2008-08-24 15:04:00,7832,Great report and pics icefisherman  Love the shot of the deer tracks.....cool! A good mix bag of fish was caught....congrats and Thanks for sharing Leechman

242872,douG,2008-08-24 16:04:00,2693,"Fabulous, Emil.  Your photography skills are jumping by leaps and bounds, just like your mad skilz on the lakers in Opeongo.  Just a great photo log.  I like the shots of Jr with those great lakers, and of course the boat-proud shot in the sunset.  You could sell that one to Lund for sure.  Three generations trips are very important to all, even tho the younger generation doesn't yet realize the importance of those lasting memories.  I have one of those trips planned for the last weekend of trout season on Opeongo, with Pa and my sister's son.  Thanks for posting, and welcome home."
