243262,Cudz,2008-08-25 15:27:00,2652,It was very cold this morning.  I was on the water by 6 am and was off by 10  this morning.  It seemed to get colder and as you can see I was ill prepared wearing shorts and flip flops.  i decide to try something new and was pleased with the results.  I managed 12 smallmouth in time I was out there and lost 3 others.  The bass are starting to get really fat.  I think they are already in their fall feeding period. Despite the cold it was a great morning on Simcoe. Enjoy the pics
