242983,Greencoachdog,2008-08-24 22:49:00,8163,  WOW!!!  That was both informative AND entertaining!!!... no need to rethink your sig eh?    You're gettin' there!
242987,lew,2008-08-24 23:02:00,12767,"Personally, I think it's pretty sad when a new member joins this board, posts a picture of a couple fish he's proud of, then has to sit back and see his story go downhill the way this one has.  If this new member never posts again I hope nobody is surprised.  I catch + - 100 muskies a year but seldom post stories or pictures anymore and it's exactly because of the type of responses that have been made to this thread.  We've lost a lot of excellent members from this board over the last couple years and there's a very good reason for that........."
242997,Greencoachdog,2008-08-24 23:42:00,8163," You're right Lew!  Whenever somebody posts a report here I try to be as appreciative as possible! It takes time and effort to post to the board, an effort a lot of people don't want to put forth! If somebody posts a pic of a fish with statistics of such and such weight or inches and it doesn't look like it to me... I'll hold my tongue and just thank them for posting, it doesn't take near as long to give a little compliment as it did to post the report! If I'm going to post a fishes stats, it will be inches only with a measuring device in the pic... hard to dispute that!  As far as the members that have left, I have seen some of these and to tell you the truth find some of it quite ridiculous!!! ""He said bad things about my fish! I'm leaving!!!"" It is the internet for crying outloud!... take this stuff with a grain of salt and consider the source!!! I know that some folks skin is way to thin... while others can cut their steak with their tongues. Ignore the people that bother you... but stand up for what you feel is right!!!  I don't think it's right for someone to logon to this board and slam/badmouth it!!! If you don't like it here... go away!... far away!!! We really don't need you here!!!   I, like 99% of the people here really enjoy and appreciate your Musky reports Lew, and it kind of saddens me to know that you don't post as much as you would like to because of the rabble rousers... but we'll be more than glad to read one of your reports whenever you feel fit to post one... and I'd like to thank you for your postings past, present, and future!!!"
243056,Spiel,2008-08-25 01:55:00,9065,"....Sheeeesh, I'll bet it's easy to manage a private board with a hundred or so members."
243106,ehg,2008-08-25 03:11:00,2666,With the volume of posts now your bound to get different opinions. That seems to be the main difference compared to 5 yrs. ago.  I remember it took a long time to go from 1 to 3 million page views. It took about the same time to go from 3 million to nearly 35 million. It's way more public.          If you carried over your posts in the last couple of board changes (like most others) you probably would exceed 6000 posts already. Do you miss the intimacy with other fishermen on a smaller board.
243110,danc,2008-08-25 03:32:00,4677,"Weighing a fish is a thing of the past IMHO. Everyone on the planet owns a digital camera. Take a quick measurement and a few photos. Especially if you're practicing catch and release. Weighing a fish is not easy on a fish that you plan to release. Who cares what it weighed? Most of us have good good idea what it might weigh by species and weight. Personally, I haven't weighed a fish in probably 15 years. And I most likely won't ever weigh one again. Factor in the accuracy of different scales and the weight means absolutely nothing anyways. Show me a photo and give me a measurement, and I'll congratulate you on your fine catch."
243114,Marko,2008-08-25 03:46:00,854,"Not once in my life did I weigh fish. Take a quick pick and measure it if its really big or if it is my PB. A person can be 6'7 and a 40 inch pike will look like a 25 inch pike in his hands, so it can really be deceiving. If you really want people to see how long your fish is and matter to you that much just take a pic with the measuring tape right next to it. From the length most experienced fishermen will roughly know how much does the fish weigh. I hope couple of negative comments wont push you away and stop you from posting."
243115,Greencoachdog,2008-08-25 03:47:00,8163,"Agreed Dan, the weight of a fish is passe'.  All you need show is the pic!!!"
243331,Zubris21,2008-08-25 19:33:00,563,"It truly is a shame, when a fish gets slammed.  Big or small, don't they all deserve a little respect?  I'm mean its thanks to the fish (and TJ and admins) that this board exists.  Whether its big or small, any fish can still be the story of a lifetime and bring mounds of enjoyment to the angler.  Unfortunately I didn't see the picture, but 36', with a 23' girth coming in at around 15lbs doesn't seem that outlandish to me.  Granted I'm not a terribly experienced pike angler.  However the biggest pike I've seen landed was 40' long on the button, and weighed in at about 16lbs, give or take a few ounces.  I know my digital scale is fairly accurate, because I've tested it with some dumbbells (5,10,15 and 20lbs) and the most it's been off is 2 ounces.  Heres a pic of the 16lber.  No girth measurement, but it was long and skinny, so I could certainly see a 4' shorter/fatter fish weighing in around the same.    Walleydiver, I really hope this thread doesn't keep you from coming back.  I love seeing reports with big pike!!"
243333,Spiel,2008-08-25 19:52:00,9065,....It is shame when a post showing off one's catch go so wrong. But it does happen from time to time. My personal apologies to Wallydiver44 for not seeing this one go astray.
243341,chickenhawk,2008-08-25 20:15:00,612,"Well after this summer......and seeing what a 15-20 pound pike looks like.......I would say on average a 15 pound pike would be about 38"" and a 20 lber would be about 42"".......your regular every 36"" will usually go about 10-12 pounds.....now I didnt see the picture and im not judging anything but it must of had to be a really thick 36"" to make 15 but then again.....you read your scale none of us did so really we cant say anything.........thx for the report.....please post again......dont worry i had the same problem when i reported my trophy count half way through the summer with no pictures.....i got told if theres no pic it aint real......you just have to laugh it off....YOU were there.....YOU measured/weighed the fish.......YOU know how big it really was and that is all that is important.....who cares if some joker comes on and tells you your fish wasnt as big as you say it was.....he dont know.....he wasn't there.....till next time,  Hawk"
243348,danbo,2008-08-25 20:39:00,2646,"God grant me the Serenity.. to accept the size of the fish I catch, the Courage .. not to fib about it, and the Wisdom ..to know that no one would believe me anyway!  Amen"
243349,Bly,2008-08-25 20:41:00,1556,"Congrats on the catches!  Would love to hook into a 36"" Pike..Congrats again!!"
243353,danbo,2008-08-25 21:14:00,2646,
243360,Dutch,2008-08-25 21:48:00,831,"I haven't caught many pike, actually one so far, so I am no expert and I didn't see the pic before it was removed.  What I did do, is search the net for weight calculators for pike.  I came across 7 or 8 and they all returned the similar numbers.  What I noticed is that the calculators that incorporate girth give a higher figure.  A 23"" girth is big for a pike that length, so it was a fat fish.  The calculators generally returnined the following figures:  13.3# (calculator considered length only) 15.9# 17.3# 21.2#  So, based on the measurements the OP posted, 15# is entirely believable.  I wonder if the OP had posted only the length/girth measurement whether replies would have been that he caught a 15# plus fish - probably not.  Give the OP a break - we are supposed to welcome new visitors......and encourage new posts - with pics even better!  Great fish nonetheless."
243485,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-26 12:43:00,0,"Oops!  I usually do not make comments on weights. Especially if they are young posters.I'm not saying you are a liar. I'm just saying your scale MAY be defective. A 36 inch pike is unlikely to weigh 15 lbs. Oh and the fish weight calculators are all garbage. I've noticed many people post fish and weights that do not look like they match. Its either the pictures are deceiving or there are a lot of faulty scales out there.  Anyways. Sorry if I ruined your thread. I should have known better.  Like I said. It was a nice Pike. And Nipissing rocks!  One more thing. I got bashed a lot when I first started posting on the net(not OFC), but that didn't stop me from contributing and meeting a lot of great people and sharing fishing techniques. Over all it has made me a better fisherman. So I hope you don't let a little thing like this prevent you from enjoying the full experience of OFC."
242169,mattmacewan,2008-08-22 02:18:00,18,"haven't fished since late June when the Shads rolled in....  went out tonight for a quick troll - picked up a couple nice fall hammerheads.  this one was 36"" on the nose and fat 23"" G, just a shade over 15lbs.  Another in the boat - 24"".  Not a bad couple hours on the water...  *weighed it twice - on my mechanical boat scale (apparently broken) and on the home scale (also apparently broken) - will have all future fish taken to town to be weighed & documented before posting."
242205,Cudz,2008-08-22 03:16:00,2652,Did you release them?  lol
242265,b2kptbo,2008-08-22 12:07:00,1505,"Good size, WTG..."
242268,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-22 12:27:00,0,I think your scale may be defective but nice pike! Nipissing has some monster pike!
242312,Leecher,2008-08-22 14:25:00,7832,Great report and pics wallydiver44  15Lbs    from looking at the pic certainly does not look that....pictures can be deceiving.  Nevertheless a great pike....congrats! Leechman
242383,wallyboss,2008-08-22 17:27:00,1095,Sorry but I can't see the picture of the 15lber?????
242402,fishinggeek,2008-08-22 18:21:00,325," It was removed on the edit apparently.  I don't see why people care about how big a fish is, both the person who caught the fish and the others that see it.  Maybe it's a competitive thing.  I just like seeing the pictures, like Lew's beautiful West Bay muskie!"
242490,steverowbotham,2008-08-22 23:07:00,1800,put the pic back
242548,Greencoachdog,2008-08-23 11:02:00,8163,"  I believe that should be ""Please put the pic back"""
242579,mattmacewan,2008-08-23 14:16:00,18,"Yes I did take it down and no I won't repost it...here's why.  I didnt post it with the intention of having armchair rod wielders sit back, hide behind their computers and essentially call me a liar with regard to fish weight.  2 of the first 4 people who responded in this thread did so, and I can't be bothered with it. I'm relatively new, and if this is how things work on this board - I haven't got time for it. I realize there are people who are skeptics & pessimists out there but if you can't say something nice (about a man's fish) then keep your mouth shut."

242596,Greencoachdog,2008-08-23 15:16:00,8163,"  ... just remember, whenever you post a fishes weight in a forum such as this... you may be inviting undesirable replies.  I've found it best just to leave the weight out of the report and let folks use their imigination, the majority will guess on the ""heavy"" side anyway."
242597,Rich Clemens,2008-08-23 15:17:00,3131,Sorry the way your post went Wallydiver ... would have loved to have seen her.  Sounds like a great pike anyway.
242617,johnnyb,2008-08-23 16:44:00,3413,"Hard to believe that it's nearing the end of August already --- sounds like a very nice fish!  How deep were you trolling?  The summer I worked on Nipissing, I remember just starting to get into the big ones around now, then had to go back to school"
242618,highdrifter,2008-08-23 16:51:00,2534," A release shot would have given a better idea as to the size of the fish anyway..  This is a forum, everything posted here is subject to debate.  The subject of diplomacy best be left to people who know better, but that was just plain un-called for.  HD"
242625,Leecher,2008-08-23 18:01:00,7832," wallydiver44,  I'm the fourth guy that responded to your post and I'm sorry that you feel this way.  Certainly was not my intention to ""call you a liar"" as you stated above and was just an observation of the pic that was posted.  What I saw did not, to me, appeared to be the size of a 15Lbs pike that you posted.....but that's just me.  I'm no pro at this, shouldn't take it so seriously......appreciated your post and hopefully will reconsider. Leechman"
242766,Handlebarz,2008-08-24 10:31:00,3790,"Wallydiver this happens all the time here and on other boards I'm sorry I did not get a chance to see it. I to dont know why some have to complain when a person shares there day out hope this thread did not chase you away this place does not usually get this way for another month or so. I also dont think you need to have 6000 posts to be able to have a good post. I do know alot of people who left boards for just the same reason that some can not seem to jsut say nice fish or add nothing if they have nothing to say. I have a couple nice fish from a few weeks but with me holding them I will not post them as they look alot smaller then they are a fat 26"" pickerel looks very small with me and the girth she had does not show. Next time just leave the size out as you will always have one or two who have nothing good to say.  This responce is not directed to anyone member just how I feel for the way alot of boards have gone. and is the reason there are some good posters who have left the net."

Please try to be more civil when you're with us. Thanks Bud.  Wallydiver, that was a good fish. Regardless of what it weighed, it's still a nice pike. Don't let people get you down."
