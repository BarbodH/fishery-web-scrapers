243045,sharper,2008-08-25 01:20:00,279,I've tried that spot a few times. Only thing being caught were small bullheads and I also saw the odd snot rocket being caught as well. Some of the regulars there I spoke with said how he caught some largemouths and large carp as well.

I recall, largies, pike, crappies, catfish,sunfish, carp,rockbass, ect...If I am not mistaken it was being maintained by cousin george tackle shop on Jane. Not sure if they are still stocking it."
243740,Anatz,2008-08-27 02:01:00,74,"Ok let me tell you, don't waste your time at Eglinton Flats. I live in Toronto and I always take the bus to go fishing. I've tried Eglinton Flats about 3 times, and there's hardly any fish in there. I've caught sunfishes in there but I didn't catch as much as I would at Grenadier Pond. Your best place to fish is @ Grenadier Pond. Large Mouth, Pikes, Carps, Crappie, Perch, White Perch,  Bullheads, sunfishes are the common fishes caught there.
