243533,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-26 14:39:00,0,"Hi guys,  Just curious what the difference are between so-called ""Trout Rod"" and ""Salmon Rod""  Also wonder why ""Trout Rod"" is signigicantly more expensive than ""Salmon Rod"" when the length is almost identical  Is it just another rip-off or?"
243590,yo_guy,2008-08-26 17:25:00,111,"To get to the point, regardless of length it's basically the construction of the rod that will differentiate the offset in price. Such as higher modulus construction will make the rod lighter more responsive yet brittle when whacked against a rock or something. If used properly and well taken care of than no need to worry!  You can't really say a salmon rod is cheaper than a rainbow rod because it's not true and you can get some nice beefy float rods that's is stronger than any type of steelhead rods that you can grab off the counters and still be relatively light.  Balancing the rod is another key aspect between a tip heavy rod and a well balance rod which is a whole different subject.  A lot of people are getting into the custom tied rods for more strength or just not happy with factory wraps etc... ultimately it's to have there own personal touch to say it's custom. Whatever the reason it may be... If your fishing for salmons in the creeks it will be a challenge to land if you get a fresh fish. Like discussed thick line in shallow water spooks fish right?  If I were you just grab a rod for pier fishing rod and save your money unless your fishing big bodies of water where it will allow you to use a 12ft /13ft rod with lots of backbone and to be able to use heavy leaders without spooking fish.  Personally if I were to target fresh salmon I chase them closer to the lake side even if it means fishing from shore. That's where the fun is to have those brutes peel line without worrying about overhung tress etc....  Damn typed to much, any questions or not clear just ask away"

If you intend to use spoon or other crank bait, You need some kind of backbone. If you will be using floats with eggs you need a noodle rod. Noodle Rod can be bought at a cheap price starting at $45 on sale, while those with some backbone will cost from $70 and up. It is hard to use noodle rod using artificial lures on heavy current, you will have to work extra hard to cast and retreive each time.  Noodle rod line weight range from 4lb-8lb, while Salmon rod line weight recomendation starts from 6-10 or 12 lb.  For steelheading you can use 9' - 12 ft rod with enough guide. Salmon Rod tends to have more backbone. Length is the least you have to be concern off. It is the number of guides that Rod manufacturer has added to it.  To catch Rainbow and Salmon, you might eventually need two different rods.  Go check Peter's Tackle at st. Katherines, They have the best selection and price for Long rods. Le baron sometimes have some decent price ones depending on season. You should not have problem getting a rod $70 +."
243704,BabyHerc,2008-08-26 23:44:00,285,"More R&D goes into developing a trout rod, since they need to be strong, sensitive, able to withstand freezing temps, able to handle light line, and let's not forget that steelhead snobs (not all steelheaders are snobs, I'm just saying) will pay anything for gear marketing toward them.  Salmon rods are generally beef-sticks with lower-modulus graphite and possibly combined with fibreglass, not to mention foam handles versus the cork on trout rods."
