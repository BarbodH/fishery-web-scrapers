Joe lives on the Servern just by the swing bridge with a short boat ride to the lake so a evening fish than a morning/afternoon fish was planned before I had to leave.  Joe's was first with this one.   We trolled around till dark and I landed 3 pickeral for the pan.   Started off Monday morning trolling the same areas as the night before but no one was home so we started casting spinner baits at the shoreline and weedy shallow bays for Bass/Pike.  Again Joe started the ball rolling.   Was casting out and my lure hit the plastic cowling on the motor which in turn left my bait-caster with a beauty case of professional over ride, while I was pickin but not grinin Joe landed 2 more respectable Pike and after I was back in action I picked-up a OK Pike. Moved around a point to a back bay with allot of rocky shoreline and weed starting about 10ft back which was crying out Smallmouth, so picked up the jigging rod and after a few cast this one hit.   We worked the bay for an other hour or so but nothing so we decided troll our way back in, we both caught some small pickeral but put'em back to get a bit bigger but Joe did land this nice 2lb'er.   Joe and haven't fished with each other for a good number of years and was good to be back in the boat together, I sure had a good time, really should make more time to do it again in the near future."
