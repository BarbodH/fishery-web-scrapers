Last time I was in there at the old location they had some Musky lures, now that they have expanded they may have more.

Compare their prices with other tackle stores and I'm sure you'll be glad you did.  I must sound like their spokesperson.  I swear I have no stake in it nor do I know anyone with a stake in it.  I'm just a loyal customer.  If they don't have it, JB's has probably the best musky selection I've seen, but be prepared to pay for it.  I've noticed they have reduced some of their prices though.  BPS has a good musky selection too, but again, you'll pay top dollar from what I've seen.  If you don't need it right away, some members have suggested Cabelas, which has good prices and saves you gas."
