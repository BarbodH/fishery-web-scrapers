242806,Lowe Rider,2008-08-24 13:16:00,79,"Yesterday morning my good friend Scott (CANADIAN COPPER) had me up before the sun. It's just not right LOL. We lauched the Lowe around 6:30 and we were off to the river at the north end. A quick lesson on working the weeds for me. Scott missed a big one or should I say didn't check the knot and lost a 6Lb fish for sure, so he says, I think it was 12lbs by the splash.    The amount of boat rage was wild, I thought the rod was going to get it    He quickly regained himself and pulled in this one.    Not long after I got my first.   Scotty with another one.   Me again.   Scott again.   Scott looking at the small guy he caught.   One of the last of the day.    All in all it was a great day on the water, it was one of the best days I've had, thanks Scott. I learned a few things like how to duck out of the way of a Senko coming back at you fast when you miss the hook set and let the big guy settle a bit after he loses a big fish.  Thanks again Scott for the great morning."
