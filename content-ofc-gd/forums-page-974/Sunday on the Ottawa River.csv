243206,Seaweed,2008-08-25 13:42:00,135,Enjoyed a near perfect day on the Ottawa river on Sunday.  The weather was stellar with just a few scattered and brief showers.  The fishing was not bad either.  Topwater action was hot for bass.  We boated a few small largemouth and a couple of nice pike.  Here are a few shots ...  Snake (Muskie or Pike?)   Largie
