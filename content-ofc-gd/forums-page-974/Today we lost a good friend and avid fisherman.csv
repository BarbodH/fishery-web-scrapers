A loving father, family man, friend and fisherman.  He is a board member here billye99.  He went out from our place where he has a weekend get a way around 6:30 and did not return.  Today we were sadly informed that he didn't make it back into shore.  His boat had been found off the breakwall in Port Colbourne.  Our condolences to his family... If there is anything we can do please do not hesitate to contact us.  Steve and Bernadette Fishmasters"
