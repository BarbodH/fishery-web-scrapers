243239,darsky,2008-08-25 14:45:00,586,Just curious if its possible to get Cuban currency here?  thx
243245,Roy,2008-08-25 15:00:00,13728,"Yes Darren you can get in touch with:  Custom House #1060, 1010, rue de la Gauchetière O. Montreal, QC N8Y 4T6  Telephone: 514.904.6796 Toll Free: 1.866.650.6836 Fax: 514.904.2983  Or call your banking institution and ask where their nearest currency exchange bureau is."
243248,Cory,2008-08-25 15:04:00,170,"CUC’s are only available for purchase in Cuba, they are not available for sale outside the country.  Bring Canadian money, you will be charged extra for US dollars.  "
243249,darsky,2008-08-25 15:09:00,586,"thx to both,albeit confused with opposite answers. Roy-worth the call tho' Anyone fish Varadero??"
243253,Greencoachdog,2008-08-25 15:19:00,8163,"  I would think that if you took US currency to Cuba, the vendors would jump all over it... something to spend in Miami after the raft ride!!!"
243255,Cory,2008-08-25 15:20:00,170,Check with Tonyb or see if you can dig up one of his old posts.  We didn't fish while we were there.  Take a trip to Havana while you are there it is worth it for a day trip.  US readers should not read anything posted above.  
243257,sirfish,2008-08-25 15:21:00,175,"Darsky, Cory is right. You can only get thier cuban peso there and bring canadian dollars. Most resorts have a exchange banco where you can convert and get a good rate.....that is unless you bring U.S."
243260,Bitsmith2k,2008-08-25 15:26:00,396,"they will not give you a good rate if you change american money over there, so bring canadian..  where you staying in veradero?"

243300,tonyb,2008-08-25 16:52:00,1637,Viva Cuba!  Here you go Darsky...  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...amp;hl=varadero  Cheers! Tony
243311,Greencoachdog,2008-08-25 17:47:00,8163, I agree!!!    btw... are you getting a tan?  ... or is it this?
243318,Cory,2008-08-25 18:13:00,170," Neither, with the bump in extra posts I now have a shot at passing your number of useless posts….."
243328,Roy,2008-08-25 19:03:00,13728," Cory, I know that you're bucking to be banned so that you can go back to your cronies and whine to them and you can all then agree what terrible people we are. You also think that you're being protected here. Well, you were. Your last several posts have been nothing but flames against other members of this board and the board itself. The mods have been very patient with you because you've obviously got some kind of a problem. Get it checked out Bud. I'm serious."
243387,Chris,2008-08-25 23:33:00,405,"Hey Darren, have a good trip man."
243422,darsky,2008-08-26 01:37:00,586,Thanks Chris-hey remember that big one Marc jr got a few yrs back. He did everything to let that fish get off but she stayed pinned. How many 8 yr olds land forty pounders ? A fun day fer sho'
