242716,Rich,2008-08-24 02:07:00,3927,"We had Tuesday off and the use of the truck so we packed up the boat and headed to the Urban Fisherman's stomping grounds hoping for some of these big bass he speaks of. Was hoping he'd be able to make it out but PM's didn't shoot back & forth fast enough unfortunately.  Anywho, the bassin' was slow. It's a big, deep, clear reservoir which makes things tough on a bright, hot day. We did eventually get into quite a few bass but all dinks. Finally spotted a good 4 pounder in a stick up but he spotted us long before we spotted him and stayed lockjawed. The most supple of offerings wouldn't subdue this bass so, defeated, we moved on. Still had a fun time there and enjoyed some of the best scenery Norfolk county has to offer.      There was even a new PB as Sugarpacket landed her new PB WGSF on a spinnerbait which just happened to be while I was bringing in a little bass. Unfortunately next to the bass, the rock bass seems much smaller than what it was. This thing was an honest pound at least.    She continued on her rock bass crusade throughout the day.    And finally, she was sidetracked by a largemouth.    This pie plate bluegill came out to play as well. Actually, it fought better than most of my bass that day. lol    And the dink of the day prize goes to me with this amazingly handicapped crappie that smacked a spinnerbait.    Like I said, a beautiful reservoir to fish though.      And this afternoon when we finished work we headed to a small municipal pond to try our luck at some largemouth. I landed a couple on weightless plastic worms, unfortunately Sugarpacket didn't have much luck here with her whopper fish being a 12 inch chub minnow. Here's the biggest of the day, which is by no means a big fish.    Always fun to get out and enjoy summer while we can!"
242718,Greencoachdog,2008-08-24 02:18:00,8163,Great report and pics Rich!!!   I gotta ask though... are you havin' an anorexia relapse?... yer gettin skinny dude!
242720,Rich,2008-08-24 02:23:00,3927,"Down 106lbs from 2 summers ago!  The three ways I lost weight:  1) I walk half hour to work and back everyday, plus walk everywhere else I can 2) I cut wayyyyy back on drinking 3) No more fast food  Though I really do miss my permanent tackle shelf"

242740,Joey,2008-08-24 04:07:00,9122,"Great report Rich.  Congrats on the weight loss.  Its a tough battle, but you seem to have it beat  That last bass is so pale, funny how a different body of water makes the fish darker and lighter.  Joey"
242758,glen,2008-08-24 06:26:00,2641,That a boy Rich.  Great report as always.

242795,mattyk,2008-08-24 12:40:00,2110,"some nice fish, thanks for the report."
242821,Mike the Pike,2008-08-24 14:22:00,3421,WTG Rich and Sugarpacket nice pics I always enjoy your reports.  I know I have to lose the weight too or my Doctor will be letting me know to smarten up
242829,Musky or Specks,2008-08-24 14:36:00,2710,Congrats on the weight loss Rich thats impressive. I hope I can do as well. That reservoir is a beautiful place. The water is crystal clear. I take my nephews and neices there swimming all the time. I love swimming back and forth from the beach to the opposite shore.
242851,scuro,2008-08-24 15:12:00,386,YOUR MARRIED?...when did that happen?
242866,The Urban Fisherman,2008-08-24 15:48:00,2050,"See what I don't get is why everybody is commenting on Rich's looks and failed to bring up the purdy girl that he was fishin' with!  Glad to see you guys made it out my way, it's to bad we weren't able to connect - next time call me on the phone dude! I've got an inside source (a fellow DC regular) that gave me a few spots and suggested carolina rigging in 15 to 20 FOW.....Less #'s but bigger fish.  Believe it or not he suggested a part of the lake that I've never fished so here's hoping for next saturday.  Even though we've got conflicting schedules I've got the truck now, and a trailer so there's no excuse for not hooking up for some buckets before fall - just find us a boat as the tooner isn't multiple angler friendly...  Cheers, UF"
242944,mepps,2008-08-24 19:33:00,1301,Great job guys!  106lbs?!! Thats unreal man.
242996,Rich,2008-08-24 23:38:00,3927," Well ain't that convenient, I got the boat and nothing to take it anywhere in!  Let me know when you're free.. I don't have a gas motor but there are some great bass lakes near me that are electric accessible. Big bass, and a little different fishing shallow water! I'm ready to go whenever you can spare a day man."
243054,evster,2008-08-25 01:48:00,367,"Nice fish, looks like you had fun!"
