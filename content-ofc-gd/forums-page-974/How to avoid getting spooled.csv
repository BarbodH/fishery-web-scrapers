Occasionally you'd hook into a real goliath..a fresh run 40+ fish. We didn't have Power Pro or anything like it so we were all running Ande or Trilene mono. Usually in the 12 pound range. Yeah it was a challenge. A big fish with a 15 mph current equals lots of running down the shoreline. When we felt that a spooling was inevitable we simply would put the rod straight up in the air and quickly drop the rod tip right into the water. This almost always stopped the fish immediately. The pressure would stop..they would stop. We could occasionally then slowly entice the fish back or hope they spit the hook. It didn't always work, but did many times save me some spoons. Failing that we would grab the spool and hope the knot let go. But with today's lines and smaller salmon, I don't see it happening."

Once those big fresh runs chinooks got into the current, forget about it   That reminds me, I really need to get down to the whirlpool late one night, have you been down yet this year?"
243418,Mike the Pike,2008-08-26 01:15:00,3421,Well here is the real deal I have alot of years experience fishing sure I thought about chasing it down with the boat remember it was a Shimano Sedona 2000 reel.There was already atleast 200 feet out when we got the hit trolling not much left on the spool.  Things happen fast my first reaction was tighten Ryan's drag I even tightened it to the maximum I could but the big brute managed to pull out lots of line.  Did NOT have time to do what all have sugessted.  Whatever it was it was powereful and in the double digit range .  We were targetting small snot rockets s h e e t happens  Thats fishing .I will be gettin a  shimano 4000 series for my boy this will give him a little more clout just in case he happens to run into the big guy again.  The boy is over it and we have heavy muskie rods for the big uns but sometimes the wrong fish hits your light tackle thats fishin.  MTP
243421,BillM,2008-08-26 01:22:00,17367,Getting spooled is all apart of fishing!  Nothing to be ashamed about at all.  I am sure he has the muskie fever now though
