For christ sake take your garbage back with you and put it where it belongs, If your throwing this stuff in our lakes your a pig!!!  End of rant!"
243033,BabyHerc,2008-08-25 00:56:00,285,Agreed.  Timmies cups and worm containers are the worst.
243037,Spiel,2008-08-25 01:07:00,9065,"....A little respect please. Christ is always, always spelled with a capital ""C"".  End of rant."
243039,cpguy29,2008-08-25 01:09:00,148,Im hoping that most of it was blown into the water and not intentionally thrown in.
243040,timmeh,2008-08-25 01:10:00,609,This is the kind of crap that ends up limiting shoreline access and gets no trespassing signs posted. It's really to bad when a few idiots create problems for everyone.
243077,Cudz,2008-08-25 02:16:00,2652,"Very true, and it is Christ's and I am not sure if the reference to him was necessary at all."
243084,Greencoachdog,2008-08-25 02:25:00,8163,"  You're talking to the wrong people!!!... and I would consider this more of a whine than a rant!  What makes you think that everyone on this board isn't just as... if not more conservation minded than you are?  Maybe you should spend your weekends patrolling the shoreline of the Bog looking for ""would be"" litterers and scolding them in person instead of suggesting that the board members here are to blame!"
243089,Spiel,2008-08-25 02:31:00,9065,.....While  I can certainly empathize with his frustrations GCD you are correct that he'll find few or no litter bugs here. I'm also certain he didn't mean to imply there was.
243093,Zubris21,2008-08-25 02:40:00,563,How much of the garbage did you pick up?
243102,forrest,2008-08-25 03:01:00,1032," Most of this thread is unimpressive, offensive and a waste.  forrest"
243143,lookinforwalleye,2008-08-25 10:45:00,4399,Sorry I brought it up!
243155,Whopper,2008-08-25 11:36:00,2174,"Spent a weekend at the West Arm, picked up a worm container and a plastic bottle and a nice new boat cushion out of the water, coming back though I was surprised at the number of Timmies cups I ran over on the 401. I can see some one losing stuff out of their boat on the water and not no it but on the highway, how can people just chuck the cups out the window"
243185,bigugli,2008-08-25 12:40:00,6138,"I'm out doing road cleanups with our service club on a regular basis. You would be amazed at people's nerve. There are those that have dumped their  trash right as they drive by you. Of course, there are those who stop and thank us. Some have even brought us coffee. Yup, Timmies.  When possible, I will pick up at shore fishing spots as well, but one bag of recyclables doesn't even make a dent in some of the worst places.  Like they say, I alone can't clean up the world, but I can look after my own little corner. Just keep it in perspective."
243192,BillM,2008-08-25 13:05:00,17367,"Anytime I go stream fishing, I'll bring along a garbage bag.  I am happy to say that it's come back empty on more then a few occasions..  Most likely because no one fishes where I do"
243197,John,2008-08-25 13:12:00,2956, They are same people that clean out their cars onto the parking lots at shopping malls and at traffic lights at off ramps Phil!
243199,danbo,2008-08-25 13:27:00,2646,Hopefully Karma will have these slobs cleaning up Hell for Eternity!
