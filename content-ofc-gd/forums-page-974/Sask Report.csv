I went to Baxter Lake that I previously fished blindly with a canoe.  This time armed with the portable I found that the deepest parts of the lake were 25 ft but it dropped to 12 feet close to shore.  That meant that I was trolling in 25 ft of water instead of the 14 ft max that I wanted.  Also I found that the rod holders worked excellent that came with the Boat.  When I finally got to the Lake I found out there was another party there.  A Dad and his Boy who were camping there.  I guess they never expected any body as they parked their vehical infront of the launch site, no worries as the small boat was easily unloaded and manouverred.  Here's a couple of Pictures of the scenery       I actually think these rod holders are realy good.  Just a matter of lifting the rod up.  Big difference from trying it out for real instead of dry training     Within 5 minutes of trolling I caught this nice fat pike on a diving Jointed Rapala.  The picture is poor as I guess the sun was in the way    I also caught a few small ones.  Still looking for a monster though.      I decided to stop and still fish using frozen minnows.  I felt a small pull slowly bouncing of the bottom and caught this small pickerel.  It was sort of color less instead of the greenish dark look.    So i put it on the stringer but I let it go thinking it would be the only one as it was getting dark soon.  But as luck would have it I got another one after the release otherwise I would of ate them for a late supper    I am expecting that I will probably be fishing with Hometownhandyman next week as he called during the week so well see what happens"
