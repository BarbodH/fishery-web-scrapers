We only got rained on for not more than a couple of hours.  There were NO mosquitoes at all, just a few annoying deerflies. The surface water temp ranged form 68°F in the mornings to 76°F in the afternoon.  The water was quite stained this year at where we were.  The fishing was good, nothing tremendous in size, but the bass, pike, and walleyes were willing to take a bait for the most part.  The spinnerbait, plastic worms, and the topwater plugs did the jobs for us.  Fog was quite thick in the mornings   Hungry bass   Little water snake sitting on the hook bend to post a pic for us (not hooked)   The  Northern we were catching were typically about this size   The evenings are always nice and calm   Little bass love hitting topwater lures   Visiting our friends near Bala on our way back, only one of them were here this year   A great week of family time for us. Thanks for looking."
