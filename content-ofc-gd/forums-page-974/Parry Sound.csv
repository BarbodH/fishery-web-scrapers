243725,Mike01,2008-08-27 01:08:00,378,I'm heading out to my girlfriends cottage on Parry Sound tomorrow.  I've done some fishing out there but havn't had a ton of luck.  Some small trout and bass are all I seem to find.  Is there anyone who could help me find some walleye?  It would be much appreciated.  Mike
