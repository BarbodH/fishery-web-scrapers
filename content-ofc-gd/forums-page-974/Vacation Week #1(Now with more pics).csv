242757,Mike the Pike,2008-08-24 06:22:00,3421,"Hey folks back after 2 weeks of vacation and I must say overall the weather was quite nice, too bad many had bad weather this year but my late August vacation paid off just a little rain.  After booking our Camping reservations too late this year there was slim pickins so we were able too book a site at Rideau River Provincial Park in Kempville Ontario about 25 minutes South of Ottawa.  I enjoyed this park as well as my kids we had great sites very close to the water only downfall was the mosquitos were the worst I have ever seen out of all the camping I have done all my life.My whole family had thousands of bites despite heavy use of bug spray.To me Watkins bug spray is the best and you don't seem to notice you have sprayed yourself.  The first couple of days were so so,light rain but nothing to complain about after that the weather improved and we enjoyed the improved weather despite 24/7 mosquito attacks.  The worst day of thunderstorms we went to Ottawa while the wimmins shopped at the Mall my son and I found the new Le Barons in Ottawa which is much nicer than the original Montreal store.  Bought some more stuff Idon't need  Well on with the pics and story.  Upon arrival the kiddies requested their frog nets and buckets and this is what they found.........   A 3 legged frog.Either some fishy ate the leg or it must have to do with the many golf courses in the area that adds to the sloppy weed growth man no wonder Justin catches lots of bass its hundreds of miles of green slop.   Finally got set up and this was our camp for the week.   A little fun with the green slop my daughter in the blue life jacket. Nice thing about minivans is my oldest daughter invited a friend for the week.can't wait till they stay home so I can get a pick up lol   Jump         Ah children(priceless) the results of frog catching   My 9 yr old son would put in 6 to 8 hours a day shore fishing .He made alot of friends including the older kids some teens who were afraid to take their fish off the hook.My boy was helping alot of them with the simple task.       Father & Son   We started to get rid of our garbage earlier after a 7pm visit from this guy one night.   One morning we heard some objects dropping onto our tent trailer so my wife investigated and we caught this rodent dropping pine cone after pinecone onto our tent trailer I really think it thought it was funny.   Junior fishing the locks .plenty of panfish .Thanks Jamie (crazyhook) for the location. Missed 2 nice bass on the surface   A visit to Merrickville.Amazing how the locks work on the Rideau.   First nite out in the canoe no fish but I tell ya alot of moron boaters who have no respect for people in canoes.  One jerk in a jet boat who we saw on several occations would blow by I would guess 50 plus MPH within 20 feet of us and others in canoes including my daughter sending his huge wake at us.no respect I tell ya if I could catch him he would learn some respect. I took a boating course and it is against the law to do what this jerk did. One night he passed 6 times I tried to tell the %#!&^)*^$ the brain dead boater to back off the throttle and all he did was wave I tried to get his number but that boat was just too fast.People like that need to lose their boating privileage. I have a boat and always respect folks in canoes and kayaks .  I want to thank the guys in the Triton white bass boat(with 175hp Mercury) for slowing down when passing.You guys are true gentleman. Its time the fines for this become more effective.Ok back to the pics.   Well my son and I went out another afternoon but it wouldn't last a storm was blowing in we got back with only 5 mins to spare before the winds picked up big time.Man glad I knew when too go back.             Time to get out with my 11 yr old Daughter she is getting to be pretty good with the net. had no time the first time I lost a nice smallie that bent my medium heavy rod almost in half under the canoe  lost it.     This Largie was caught on a top water Hedon Super Spook red head white body 4 inches long .a new favorite lure.     Now my wife was happy to be goin home because she had thousands of mosquito bites. Here she is with the Freddie Kruger ,Edward Scissor Hand pose.   Final stop on the way home Timmies in Cornwall Ontario.  Now with added pics.                        I hope you enjoyed week#1 .  Week #2 is in the making.  Mike the Pike"

243043,ccmtcanada,2008-08-25 01:16:00,7971,Awesome part one Mike!  It's great to see the whole family getting into the outdoors like that.  Your son is quite the hardcore fisherman!!  Great stuff....off to read part two now.
243364,Mike the Pike,2008-08-25 22:01:00,3421,"Thanks for the kind words and comments all.I has a little rant about one disrespectful boater while out in my canoe. Its in my report.  What gets to me is the system we have where one can go on line and obtain a boaters licence operator card. What for ;I don't think it will make people aware of the do's and don't just some basic safety issues.  I took a boaters course and I must say I did learn alot from it.  One thing that was clearly told to us is as a boater you are responsible for your wake.  When approaching a small craft ,Kayak ,Canoe or small boat you must slow down if you are very close to these vessels common sense is all you need.I know that the kind folks on this board have that respect but the boating world has to make big boats respect the smaller crafts.  If a boater does swamp you or you feel it was a close call try and get the boats ID number you can report him to the OPP or QPP and they will get a fine no questions asked.Sorry just my rant but Morons need to be removed from our waterways.  Mike the Pike"
