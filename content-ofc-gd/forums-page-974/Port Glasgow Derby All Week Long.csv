This is the first year for the derby, it is meant to be a family fun event. We have boated no less than 19 30"" walleye this summer the biggest was 38"" and over 14 pounds. The walleye fishing on Lake Erie is awesome but in my opinion the bigger ones seem to hang around the central basin near Port Glasgow.  Here is some more Glasgow fish porn    "
