28676,Joey,2007-01-30 21:32:00,9122,"Congrats Kirk, that's great news.  At least we know why you couldn't catch any fish last November ...too busy  Joey"
28680,Kirk,2007-01-30 21:44:00,347,"Not to worry Gerrit, don't need a lawyer to get shares if you sleep with president of the company.  I can still fish Lew, I think June is safe since the due date is August 23.  A+ in math Joey? November was a good month"

28708,Carp,2007-01-30 23:33:00,1488,"  I remember the glare too Kirk. Now that we do have the third, she just threatens divorce if I mention the possibility of #4.  I'm happy my wife still lets me work in the garden, but she says I already have too many vegetables and won't let me plant any more seeds.   Congradulations Kirk and Anna."
