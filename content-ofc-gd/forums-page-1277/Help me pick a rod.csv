29008,Bernie,2007-01-31 17:07:00,3190,I would read Spiels advise closely. The guy knows his stuff.
29733,kennyman,2007-02-02 00:43:00,737,"Thanks for the help everyone  . I guess at the show I'll grab a 7' graphite rod rated for 8 to 15lb test with a fast action. I'll be checking the Fenwick, Shimano, Berkely,St. Croix and Quantums I guess. Hopefully I'll get a good deal on one. I'll let you know in a couple weeks which one I bought. I really did look in the classifieds here as well,but by the time I drive all the way somewhere for just a rod,how much did I really save. Not only that,but at the show I can really compare them and get a good deal. P.S. should I get hung up on the IM6,IM7 & IM8 ratings?"
29742,Gerritt,2007-02-02 01:03:00,6129,"  Follow Spiels  advice CLOSELY! he knows what he speaks... and he is indeed correct... I have quite a few ""junk"" rods... including the Ugly Stick"" and they are just that....Capital J ""unk""  once you hold a rod that is designed for  a specific purpose you will understand what I mean..  They better the rod IMHO the better the quality of build and the warranty to back it up.  Just my 0.02 cents  Gerritt."
28804,GbayGiant,2007-01-31 02:10:00,1780, Perch are not legal on GB as far as I know unless they just changed it this year ?  I wish they were I'd have a jumbo on a quick-strike instead of a sucker for musky.
28861,Weeds,2007-01-31 04:18:00,782,"Kennyman, might be worth looking through the classified section, there's some higher end rods at good prices if you browse through some of the ads. Just a thought."
29004,bigbuck,2007-01-31 16:59:00,2449,"Look around, there are deals to be had. JB's has boxes full of decent rods for pretty good prices. Your best bet would be to buy yourself 2 rods for around $100 as opposed to just one. That way, you can have 1 that's a medium action and one that's a medium/heavy or heavy action to haul out the big pike and big bass outta the weeds."
29007,steverowbotham,2007-01-31 17:05:00,1800,"Shimano Clarus is a great all around rod, you can pick them up for under 100 bucks."
