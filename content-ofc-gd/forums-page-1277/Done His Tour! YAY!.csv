29047,fishergirl72,2007-01-31 17:56:00,455,"Holdfast, Thank you so much for sharing that! I cannot speak for everyone, but myself I am soooo thankful for what our military (past and present) has done for us and our country! They have my upmost respect! I am teaching my daughter about our military and what they have done. She watched her uncle last August pack up to go away on his tour and had so many questions for him on why he was going away and if he is coming home (she is only 5 years old) I agree with you 100% in everything that you said. When he was home for his 3 week leave, we noticed a change in him. He was more snippy, rough around the edges so to speak but we understand why. We cannot imagine what he has been through or what he has seen, he has told us some stuff but it has too be so hard on them and to come home to another way of life. I know that during his tour, one of the veichles that he was driving had a rocket gernade go through his truck but thankfully the dang thing did not go off! I am glad he can now come home and watch his new daughter grow! And Holdfast, Thank you for everything that you sacrificed for our country!  I will give your thanks to him Joonmoon!  Thank you very much Squid!!   You nephew just made a unselfish decision and I know he will do well! But he might have to go there afterall, the war was said not to be completed until 2009 and they really want to bring more of our soliders there.  Thank you so much steve_paul for the support that you have shown me and my family in the last 6 months! Deanna (the baby) is doing great! All she wants to do is eat and she is VERY vocal.LOL She has gained over 4 lbs this month and I know he misses his little ""peanut"" like crazy!"
