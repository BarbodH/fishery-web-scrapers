29211,Guest gbfisher,2007-01-31 23:55:00,0,"Was out with James Meger(M.E.E.G.S) and Rhybak on Simcoe yesterday. Started out slow but picked up with action most of the day. First fish was a 10"" SMELT....no smelt in Simcoe...LOL.... Next caught a laker and then 2 whities for me. Rhybak caught 2 as well and James  caught and lost quite a few with one snap off  :o and only put one on the ice. Fish were coming through every so often. . All the fish I cleaned were JAMMED full of minnows in the 2.5 to 3"" range. Good day out for sure. Here's some pics.         Nice way to start 2 months of white fish season.... ;D"
