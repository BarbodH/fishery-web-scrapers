29866,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-02 05:19:00,957,"A lot can be learned about the game of football by playing a couple of snaps on the defensive line.  Pick up an education in a short time.  Best to start at the top by playing against professionals.  There's no artificial way to gain respect for those who are the best in the game.  I wouldn't miss Sunday's game.  Won't even blink.  Might miss something great.  Wouldn't suggest anyone watch it if they don't want to.  Boys have an opportunity to become men by playing football, even if it's only on the high school level."
29929,dustink,2007-02-02 13:11:00,526,  Nothing more true to say Connie....
29934,OhioFisherman,2007-02-02 13:37:00,6623,Go Browns? or the local name Clowns!
29938,BITEME,2007-02-02 13:44:00,1969,"u guys laughing with me or at me, cus im not laughing    j/k   Must be a no timer  Didnt Madonna sing a song ""Like a ______ touched for the very first time  Sorry man cant resist"
29996,kennyman,2007-02-02 15:24:00,737,"For those who are interested,here is a fun link that will ask you five questions (varied) and choose the team you should be rooting for on Sunday. It's good fun,give it a shot. Here you go http://playoffs.nfl.com/bandwagon/index.as...y=sbcompromogif ."
30026,fishindevil,2007-02-02 16:17:00,6254,"fishing is way better that football,any day of the week.....  oh well at least only ther die-hards will be out on sunday fishing,the lakes might just be empty with everyone watching the game and having a party..oh ya and on the radio they said extra R.ID.E.PROGRAMS WILL BE OUT IN FULL FORCE...so be carful"
30054,snoil,2007-02-02 17:18:00,139,go lions go right thread but also wishful thinking...
29549,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 19:30:00,933,"hey guys is it just me who thinks the superbowl is nothing but a huge advertisment opportunity? and thats all it is, the actually game is forgotten? what do yall think? i myself aint a football fan, but will watch the game i guess ...."
29550,Uncle Buck,2007-02-01 19:31:00,1000,Not a Fan and have never watched a whole superbowl game  definitely commercial oriented
29551,Puckhead,2007-02-01 19:32:00,377,"I love it.  Getting together with friends, a few brown pops and some chow.  All good fun. The game is really secondary, unless you have a favorite team in the mix.  Always have a great time on Super bowl sunday!"
29556,Headhunter,2007-02-01 19:39:00,5703,"I took the ""Browns the the Superbowl"" this morning... does that count? Sorry for that, I couldn't help myself! Not a football fan, too boring, not enough action and far too much hype! Heck, we can't even watch the best commercials here in Canada, as Global is carrying it here and they are running their own program! HH"
29559,douG,2007-02-01 19:42:00,2693,I think they oughta call it 'The HyperBole'.  It's way over the top and the jingoism gets stale real quick.
29563,Joey,2007-02-01 19:53:00,9122,"Just think of how many people ""won't"" be fishing on Sunday.  That's how I look at it     I'll be out there.  Joey"
29571,mattyk,2007-02-01 20:04:00,2110,I perfer the NCAA football final. Its more exciting. But the super bowl is a good excuse for getting some buddies together and pigging out on some good food.
29580,irishfield,2007-02-01 20:14:00,26272,"How many minute delay for the half time show this year ! LOL  Joey's got the right idea...more fish for the lot of us on Sunday.  I'll be up in ""God's country"" with Leah and won't have a choice between Superbowl and fishing on our two channel TV. Mind you it looks like -32C for Sunday am...so I may make a choice between fishing and something else...if ya know what I mean...."
29600,douG,2007-02-01 20:38:00,2693,"Sink the sub? Hide the weasel? Park the porpoise? Bit of the old humpty dumpty? Little Jack Horny? The horizontal mambo? The bone dance, eh? Rumpleforeskin? Baloney bop? Hmm?"
29607,irishfield,2007-02-01 20:43:00,26272,
29613,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 20:50:00,933,"i dont get that doug  my moms birthday is sunday, soo i probably wont get out to fish, but saturday looks good..."
29616,Joey,2007-02-01 20:53:00,9122, Well that's a shame bud.  Joey
29618,Garyv,2007-02-01 20:54:00,547,"Although I'm not much of TV sports fan like a fishing trip it gives those who love the game a reason to get excited..  Being originally from Chicago I know from talking and emailing friends and relations there that the hype has been good for the city and suburbs.  I only hope if the bears win that calmer heads prevail in the streets.   I love the commercials very original and funny.  Guess if your spending millions for 30 sec you have got to give it your all.  To bad companies couldn't give some of that cash to the needy, but that's for another day.  I was at one time a big Bears fan and went to many of the games at the old soldiers field.  Some time with the wind coming off the lake along with very cold temps weather conditions under normal circumstances would have been unbearable, but during the game no one seemed to notice, especially the nuts that were naked from the waist up. Although we were in Canada for the last Bears super bowl win the 26th of January 1986 it still brought back lots of memories of my youth and being at the games.  So at least for me I say Go Bears..."
29622,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 20:58:00,933," well im sorry joey, i wasnt around when those were used..."
29626,GbayGiant,2007-02-01 21:02:00,1780,"Definitely a big money maker for companies and team owners it would be alot better without them, but the thing with football is the players can't sleep or even loose concentration for one second because you will end up on a stretcher on your way to emergency, unlike other professional sports when they slack all the way though the regular season you can't do that in football they always go 100% that's also why they only play one game a week to rest there bodies. Plus it's only one game unlike most big sports have a series of games so that comes into factor for so much hype."
29637,Puckhead,2007-02-01 21:11:00,377,  
29641,GbayGiant,2007-02-01 21:18:00,1780,"Oh man that's a cool pic, looks like Manning going to have a hard time dealing with the Bears defence."
29676,steve_paul,2007-02-01 22:18:00,658," No but you are around because they were used!!!!!!!!!  BTW, probably will watch a bit of the game and hoping the Bears win"
29680,Joey,2007-02-01 22:23:00,9122, Ahahahahahahahaha!!!  Joey
29683,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 22:25:00,933,"u guys laughing with me or at me, cus im not laughing     j/k"
29688,snoil,2007-02-01 22:34:00,139,ummm go Lions go!!!!
29689,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 22:35:00,933," Lions?? is that even football? i think its the bears and colts, wrong thread dude"
29752,kennyman,2007-02-02 01:25:00,737,"I'm not a huge football fan, but I feel like I should hope for the Colts. I've been to Indy quite a few times (P.R.I. show) and really like the city. I've been in the dome a bunch of times too,but never for a game. I kind of feel guilty because we have a Canadian on da Bears, but I'll be cheering for the Payton/Harrisson connection Sunday."
29840,douG,2007-02-02 04:33:00,2693,"I vote for the Raptors, some really nice people there, and I think that we should cheer on those boys that actually grew up in Toronto.  My 2 c."
29856,Moosebunk,2007-02-02 05:04:00,3970," Obviously doooood, to a football ""fan"" it's more."
