Ask for help in French! 9 out of 10 times you will be transferred to someone in Montreal as opposed to Bangladesh There should be at least one bilingual person who can help This trick should work on all multinational company's who offshore their phone support  Finally I don't have to lose it, every time I call"

I nearly had a fit!!! here it is -20 and wasnt expecting her response... I asked her where she was... she told me he was in India... seems even mah bell has moved offshore.  Gerritt.
