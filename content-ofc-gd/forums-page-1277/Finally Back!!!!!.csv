Been awhile since I posted on the old board as well so I just wanted to say ""Howdy"". Chuck (BIGCHEV4x4) I tried to no avail to get on the board to get you out on the ice. Give me a shout, remember it is Trudeau in the book.  Take care guys, hope to see some familiar faces down at the spring fishing show. MR. MEGER give me a shout.
