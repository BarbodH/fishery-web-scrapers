29472,misfish,2007-02-01 15:53:00,29133,I remember Kulik putting a hurt on some crappie on another show.  Look forward to watching another.
29481,Zib,2007-02-01 16:08:00,369,Too bad I don't get that channel. I'd like to see them on the Detroit River. Can't wait to spring so I can get out there.  Does anyone know if OLN went off the air or did they change their name? I'm looking to change my cable providers so that I can get some better outdoor shows.
29508,fishindevil,2007-02-01 17:46:00,6254,"thanks for the info karl,your show rocks bud,i try to never miss it WTG....go get em  oh ya and zib yes OLN is alive and well ,its got some great shows but if you are gonna up-grade make sure you get a package with WFN,its awsome and here in ontario its only i think $3.99 a month...cheers"
29531,Zib,2007-02-01 18:53:00,369,"Thanks Fishindevil,   Unfortunately I don't have the option of getting WFN here in Michigan. My choices are The Outdoor Channel & Versus (which I believe is OLN's new name). In order to get those channels I have to get a higher end digital cable package that comes with movie channels that I could care less about. I get my raise in a couple of months so I'll be upgrading my cable service then. My son will be happy because then he can watch the Red Wings on Versus."
29628,kennyman,2007-02-01 21:02:00,737,"You need to see Extreme Angler. K-Dawg sets the hook so hard I swear he's going to pull the fish in half. I've always wondered how many small bass have flown over the boat   . Don't expect to go right to sleep after watching this show.  Maybe there should be a disclaimer at the beginning of the show- WARNING- watching this may cause quickness of breath,increased blood pressure,heart palpatations,insomnia,also may cause increased expectations which may lead to depression, nausea or vomitting. Watch at your own risk."
29679,Zib,2007-02-01 22:22:00,369,I went to WFN's website & they offer free On-Demand video of all there shows after they have aired. Hopefully they have tonight's show on there later on.
