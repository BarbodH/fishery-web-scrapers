To the other end you tie #4 or #6 razor-sharp trebles 4 to 6 inches apart depending on the size of your minnows. If you're using wire, you'll have to crimp the components on. Depending on where you're fishing, you may need to add  a bead and a spinner blade just below the swivel...check the regs for the area you'll be fishing."

30003,Roy,2007-02-02 15:35:00,13728,Yup..... that's what I use when I've used them Terry. Makes for an easier release as well.
30049,BabyHerc,2007-02-02 17:08:00,285,"I like to keep the hooks a little closer together than Roy suggested, but it's just personal preference; 4 inches max, but more like 2 or 3 inches apart - this will let me have one in the back under the dorsal fin, and one near the tail.  It just depends on the size of the bait used, and the size of the pike in the area... maybe I should start fishing for bigger fish? Also, I like to have the hook-points directed towards the tail of the minnow, since pike will grab the bait head-first on most occasions, this helps avoid deep hooking if you plan to release, or if you don't want to run through rigs like no tomorrow."
