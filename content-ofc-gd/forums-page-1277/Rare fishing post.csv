29573,Joey,2007-02-01 20:09:00,9122,Well come back Saturday or Sunday and you'll see lots of fishing posts  Joey
29585,Spiel,2007-02-01 20:21:00,9065,....It would seem your origional post was in the wrong forum and one of the Mods moved it here. Lots of fishing reports on this page and the ensuing pages.
29589,Roy,2007-02-01 20:22:00,13728,You most likely don't have the same front page as everyone else. I just looked and it's 76% fishing.
29631,Joey,2007-02-01 21:05:00,9122,Did you calculate that in your head Roy?  Joey
