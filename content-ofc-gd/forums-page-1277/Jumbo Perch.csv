29528,Dartee,2007-02-01 18:44:00,47,"If it real then is must be a European perch.  The European perch (Perca fluviatilis) is a species of perch found in Europe and Asia. In some areas it is known as the redfin perch or English perch, and it is often referred to by the shortform perch. The species is very popular and has been widely introduced beyond its native area, into Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.  European perch are greenish with red pelvic, anal, and caudal fins. They have 5-9 dark vertical bars on their sides.  European perch size can vary greatly between bodies of water; in Australia the fish are sometimes much larger than in their native Europe. The perch can live for up to 22 years, and older perch are often much larger than average; the maximum recorded length is 20 inches (51 cm) and the largest recorded weight is 10.4 lbs (4.75 kg).  The perch spawns at the end of April or beginning of May, depositing it upon weeds, or the branches of trees or shrubs that have become immersed in the water; it does not come into condition again until July."
