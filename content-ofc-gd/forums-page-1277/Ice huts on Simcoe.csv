We have found a minimal thickness of 6 inches (except for pressure cracks ) Out as far as 80+ ft of Water with a good 9 inches+ around that . The Access from Jackson's Pt is Now Open at Bonnie Boats .The Lock is off the gate.. for ATV travel & skidoo travel..NO CARS OR TRUCKS YET OK ...!!!!    So far Bonnie Boats and Hanks Huts Are running huts out to 60-70 ft of water ... Of course We are now in 80+ as THAT'S where The fish are ! ! ! there are driven trails out please be VERY CAREFUL on all manuvers on Lady Simcoe . She will swallow an unsuspecting unlearned ice traveller. Talk to the locals and follow there advise ..You'll be ON FISH and On Ice ..the past few days WE decided to go out from Lands End ...Tha Salvation Army Rd. access . Today we Rounded the Point...(Jackson's Pt) and found Much smoother ice for fish hut transport..  CATCH SOME FISH ! ! ! ! ! !
