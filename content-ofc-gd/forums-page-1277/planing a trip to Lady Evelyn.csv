29715,irishfield,2007-02-01 23:47:00,26272,"I hear yah bowshep...I think we all know the guy you talk of ! LOL  Lady E takes some work to get into, by boat anyhow, but I've heard it's well worth it. Many other choices up there and lots of Crown land to camp on for free as well. Was a nice place for sale on Lady E this fall that I should have snagged..but..it's sold."
