29619,JustinHoffman,2007-02-01 20:55:00,482,"Hello All,  Headed out for three hours today to Petrie Island (Ottawa) to search out some crappie. Nice to have the whole area to myself, except for one other hut some 100 yards away. Fished my usual spots, working the nine to ten-foot depths.  The maiden voyage for the new HT Polar Express!    The vex starting marking fish immediately, many within one to two-feet off bottom.  First fish of the season..    The larger fish (10+ inches) would suddenly appear suspended at around five-feet down. A quick spin of the reel, and another fish on the ice. Largest for the day was 11.5 inches. Numerous 10 and 11-inchers were also caught.      The two top lure choices were a silver Forage Minnow (smallest size) tipped with a Berkley Power Honey Worm, as well as the HT Marmooska tipped with half a honey worm.  Kept 7 fish out of the approximately 35 landed. Also caught a couple decent 'gills.  Ready for the fillet knife!    All in all a decent start to the season - can't believe this was my first outing!! Great to have a spot like this only 15 minutes from the house...  Good Fishing,  Justin"
