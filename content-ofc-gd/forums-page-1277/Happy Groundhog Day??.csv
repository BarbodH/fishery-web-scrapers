This Friday, February 2 is also World Wetlands Day, giving people across the globe a special opportunity to celebrate the international importance of conserving wetland habitat – even in countries like Canada where wetlands are frozen at least part of the year!  “Our wetlands may be frozen, but there’s still lots going on and that bodes well for what these wetlands will do come spring,” says Dr. Henry Murkin, director of conservation programs with Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC). --------------------------------------------------   Now I have two excuses to celebrate today.   Happy day for both reasons.  Pam"
