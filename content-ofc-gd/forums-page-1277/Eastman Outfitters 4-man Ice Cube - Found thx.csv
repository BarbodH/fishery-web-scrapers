30012,Gerritt,2007-02-02 15:51:00,6129,Tony have you tried Bill Bait n Tackle? they will custom order for you.   I just called them for you and they did carry them earlier this year... he is out now but can order one for next week for you...  905-388-Lure (5873) Gerritt.
30015,Corey,2007-02-02 15:54:00,355,"Gerritt, you should give a quick account of watching the guys behind us trying to put up their Eastman on Thursday. Best I can offer at this point on the Eastman is to make sure you have Gerritt fishing close to you so that he can chase the bag for the hut half way across the lake when the wind picks up  cd."
