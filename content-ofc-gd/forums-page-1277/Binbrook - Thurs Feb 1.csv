29519,Corey,2007-02-01 18:16:00,355,"Well, as discussed earlier, headed out to Binbrook this morning to see how the bite was... Got out there, parked beside Gerritt who was nice and cozy in his heated hut. A short while later Bill Parker showed up, so we fished for a few hours... caught a few small dinky perch, other than that nothing else was going on. Seemed like the fish turned off into the late morning and then the wind picked up causing havoc for a few people out there.  Gerritt took some pics, I'm sure he'll post them up later. Hopefully the bite picked up after I left, cause with the wind that was starting to howl, it isn't worth it to stand there with no fish.  I may try and hit up the dam in Dunnville tonight depending on how things go.  cd."
29535,tonyb,2007-02-01 19:00:00,1637,"Doh, another dead action report from Binbrook.  Is it so popular because it's close?  Tony"
29536,Gerritt,2007-02-01 19:08:00,6129,"Not much to add to Corey's post other then I could not have fished with Better guys! They are interesting and know who to carry on a conversation.

Ahhh well sure beats sitting at home!!!  Nice to meet yah guys perhaps we can plan another outing were we can acually catch something to bring home for the table!  <br><br> Gerritt.   "
29537,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 19:08:00,933,"hmmm i dont think any of those conservation parks have amazing ice fishing,IMO"
29539,Gerritt,2007-02-01 19:11:00,6129,I disagree when the Crappie are on the bite is awsome! just a crap day though compared to yesterday... I blame it on the moon cycle... Yah thats it!  Gerritt.
29540,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 19:12:00,933,i guess it could be...
29541,Spiel,2007-02-01 19:16:00,9065,"....Sounds good enough to take my boy up there for an hour or two, maybe next weekend. Oh and how is your hut working out for you Gerritt....lol"
29544,SHAD,2007-02-01 19:22:00,134,Good try guy's!  Place looks empty compared to last Sunday - were u guy's the only one's on the ice?
29545,Rich,2007-02-01 19:24:00,3927,Great report despite the lack of fish guys!
29612,poobah,2007-02-01 20:49:00,39,"Just an FYI, next week is Binbrooks Ice Fishing Derby  http://www.glanbrookconservation.on.ca/events.html"
29630,xrap,2007-02-01 21:03:00,683,"We headed down there today but  a bit further down the lake. Pretty much same story lots of dink perch and then moved to a new stop to try for something bigger and got a couple of huge hits, maybe from pike or bigger crappie but didn't land them. Went back to the perch hole caught some more then we were off, to windy and cold out there. Wanted to get a couple pics of my first time ice fishing so here they are.          "
29699,Gerritt,2007-02-01 23:02:00,6129,Dude! I thought you said you werent coming??  Nice report btw  Gerrit.
29702,huntervasili,2007-02-01 23:08:00,1604,"Gerritt... i caught another 10 or so after you left in the hour, missed lots of hits and i got my bro to come out for an hour he got another few and i got another 10 or so too... We mover 5 ft away from the ""danger"" sign and they were hitting good there... caught 5 in a row with minnows hooked through the back on a Genz worm... Of course the one thing we didn't try Pretty fun although a little windy... we gotta get out again some time...  Bill"
29763,Gerritt,2007-02-02 01:43:00,6129,"  No unbelieveably! there were quite a few surrrounding us...  we were 10-15 feet from the ""danger line"" exactly were I was the day before infact I used the same hole! LOL most were just behind us and beside us.... There was another OFC'r there, Buddy (a new guy)... he told me via PM he was there but didnt find us... there was very little caught by anyone, on the way back to the truck I talked to a few guys in other huts, in varying depths and the same thing was reported... I wonder if they moved to the ""top"" end of the lake.   Gerritt."
29779,Corey,2007-02-02 02:30:00,355,so what's the plan for saturday? I can get out for the morning. anyone feel like hitting Dunnville? Welland Rec Canal? Marina in Jordan?  cd.
29787,Gerritt,2007-02-02 02:44:00,6129,"Corey, I will bringing my nephew out for the his first time ice fishing (He's six and wants to go!).... while I would love to hit Dunnville I cant justify the drive if he wants to go home in 30 minutes LOL... I may hit binbrook one more time...just for him.. I am sure I wont have the time to fish making sue he is having a goodtime...   Gerritt."
29800,xrap,2007-02-02 03:18:00,683,  Don't know Binbrook well this was my first time fishing at this part of the lake and I was pretty far down the lake and the ice in some spots reached 8 inches and at some parts if you stepped on it you would fall right threw. It was very tricky out there so if your going to fish further down watch out.
29867,huntervasili,2007-02-02 05:21:00,1604,Ohh heres one of the other guys who wanted his pic taken... i call it Perch imitating 14 lb 'eye
