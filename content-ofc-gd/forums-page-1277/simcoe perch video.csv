29209,Terry,2007-01-31 23:54:00,14456,"I don't know anything about the song..only it was fishing related and had a nitro bass boat in it, and I have a nitro bass boat..so it seemed right maybe someone else will know"
29212,bubbles,2007-01-31 23:56:00,591,"Great job on the video, makes me think about the discussion about live bait or not though"
29255,aniceguy,2007-02-01 01:26:00,1094,"great video watched it a few times already, makes me gotta get an aqua view"

29321,Terry,2007-02-01 02:39:00,14456,"ok I had to do some digging and here is what I found The bass tournament song"" by Rodney Clawson.  gone fishing CD from BassPro Shop"
29322,cisco,2007-02-01 02:40:00,597,Great job Terry! Really fun video
29330,pooch,2007-02-01 03:07:00,139,"Great vid Terry!  I've never been so excited to watch perch ice fishing.  What type of video equipment do you use? Do you find it fustrating to see the fish, but not have any takers?  Great stuff"
29346,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-01 03:59:00,0,Good stuff Terry.
29378,Terry,2007-02-01 10:42:00,14456,"I did for sure get some takers on film but I have much more where they looked and looked and didn't bite..it didn't bug me that they didn't bite I just kept trying different things...just think if you don't have a camera, how many do the same thing and you never know they are there I used the DVR recorder from aquavu"
29383,misfish,2007-02-01 11:04:00,29133,Very cool bud. Thats an awesome song. Got it burned to cd for when Im out in the boat.  Cant wait to try that camera out this weekend.
29388,Terry,2007-02-01 11:35:00,14456,the guys are telling me that lake is too dark for the camera to work...but I will take it and see for myself I want to see crappie on video.....lol
29432,danbo,2007-02-01 14:16:00,2646,
29441,Terry,2007-02-01 14:36:00,14456,"dando, I noticed the very same thing I would have thought that they would have a lot more flowing movement but it didn't move any more then a stick bait marabou may be the way to go...."
29524,Greencoachdog,2007-02-01 18:37:00,8163,That's a very good video Terry!  I wish lake Henry was that clear right now.  What size SD card did you have in your recorder? and how many minutes did you get on it?
29527,Terry,2007-02-01 18:44:00,14456,"I have a 1gig card, but with a few hours of recording I did,  I hardly used any memory I am going to a lake this weekend that everyone has told me it's way to drity to get a picture with the camera..it will be a good test"
29530,Greencoachdog,2007-02-01 18:49:00,8163,I might take mine out and play with it some more (Aqua-Vu  ) and my next purchase will be the DVR... if the lake ever clears up!
29534,douG,2007-02-01 18:55:00,2693,I'd like to see the same experiment with a small BadBoyz jig and a 2 in twister tail.  Icefisherman and I were fishing for perch in late December off Georgina island in 12 feet of gin clear water.  I thought that the BB jig generated a lot more interest.
29755,Terry,2007-02-02 01:31:00,14456,"yeah  douG, I should set up a bunch of rods and types of jigs and just see how they all move"
