29002,steverowbotham,2007-01-31 16:43:00,1800,"Hey guys,  I go to College in Lindsay but I dont have class until 2pm on Fridays, so I was wondering if anyone wanted to fish the Bog with me on Friday.    I have no idea what I'm doing on Scugog, it is usually buzzbait and flippin jig territory for me, so shallow water ice fishing is new to me.  Let me know, I'll be around."

I got 3 last weekend along with several out of season crappies thay were released. Where were you planning on getting on the ice? and what time would you be getting there?

29283,steverowbotham,2007-02-01 01:45:00,1800,"wherever guys.  Like I said I dont really know the lake, but the north or east side would probably be best for me.  LEt me know, and I'll meet you there !"
29332,eyefish,2007-02-01 03:17:00,135,I will be going out from goreskis... should be heading out around 6:30 or so...half an hour walk out so fishing by around 7...lemmie know
29349,steverowbotham,2007-02-01 04:08:00,1800,I can be at Goreski's for 6:30.  What kind of tackle should I bring ?
29415,steverowbotham,2007-02-01 13:53:00,1800,Can I get minnows at Goreski's ??
29443,Beans,2007-02-01 14:37:00,3339,Is Goreski's open for parking or do you still have to park 2 miles away ?  Can't blame him for closing but hopefully he had a change of mind...
29466,eyefish,2007-02-01 15:30:00,135,you need to get minnows from causeway bait and tackle it's on 7A. as far as tackle...I only use 1 rod i don't bother using set lines 1 rod for jigging thats all I use. And yes you still have to park a mile away...i timed it..and it takes 35 mins to walk from the car to the spot i fish at!
29494,steverowbotham,2007-02-01 17:14:00,1800,I'll be there for 630 ish then ??  Scotty are you going to make it out too ??
29625,gone_fishin,2007-02-01 21:01:00,481,"i'll be there, i just need some directions to where to park and where we're gonna meet. and steve, if you wanna pick up minnows, i'll pitch in a couple bucks."
29635,steverowbotham,2007-02-01 21:10:00,1800,"eyefish, I just had a class rescheduled for tomorrow, so I'll only have time to fish the north end of the lake.  sorry man.  If you're headed out again on a Friday, let me know, I'll be there. good luck tomorrow."
