405955,highdrifter,2009-11-27 04:13:00,2534,Starting to see more of these.. Thought it was more common stateside.  Dunno if that's a good thing or not..  A trout's a trout right??  What a purty girl though eh!     Sweet dreams.. HD
405975,Twocoda,2009-11-27 04:56:00,4130,"sweet!!! was this pic taken with the gfs new camera???  over the years my son and i have whats called ""The Wall of Shame"" all fishing pics instead of the"" wall of fame"" that would be an awsome pic for it"
405990,laszlo,2009-11-27 11:36:00,487,cheeks almost as plush as yours sweety!  LASZER
405995,solopaddler,2009-11-27 12:14:00,8605,Nice one buddy! Personally I maintain that these fish are strays from the U.S. Others I've talked to that are in the know say otherwise. Regardless did you bonk her?
406032,highdrifter,2009-11-27 14:23:00,2534," Thanks dude!  Surprisingly enough, the pic was taken with an old powershot 4mp.  A better camera would have really brought out the pink.  She still hounds me about that cam..  Think we'll need to upgrade."
406033,highdrifter,2009-11-27 14:24:00,2534, Oh behave...
406034,highdrifter,2009-11-27 14:31:00,2534, Cool.  Couldn't do it brother...  Every girl is just too precious to bonk.  I'm running low though.  A loose hen chinny would be a great find!!
406035,solopaddler,2009-11-27 14:35:00,8605," Good for singles and chumming, not much else.   (I said that tongue in cheek btw, I know you're not the bonking type.)"
406042,highdrifter,2009-11-27 14:46:00,2534, HAHAAH!! Kidder...

406297,Paulus,2009-11-28 04:32:00,522,"christie'd beau poisson! it's nice to see more contributions from you, dood. Keep it up!  depending on where you're fishing them, they could be local stockers. but even the wildest fish start changing colours if they've been in the river long enough.  p.-"
