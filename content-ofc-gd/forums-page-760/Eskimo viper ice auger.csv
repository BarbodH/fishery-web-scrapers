No major troubles other than in REALLY cold (-30) temps we had about 7 years ago it wouldn't start...guys around me with jiffy's had no problem. When the sun warmed things to around -15 it worked. Stalls out once in a while but that may be my gas mixture or some other setting I haven't adjusted. All in all its been ok, not fantastic, but fine."

I sold it last spring for 300 bucks,I paid 350 for it brand new.Only reason I sold it was my father was selling his brand new still in the box jiffy for the same 300 bucks."
406158,bow slayer,2009-11-27 19:44:00,1074,I was just in Canadian Tire and both the jiffy 30 8 inch and eskimo viper are on sale. The difference in price is only 40 bucks. 339 for eskimo and 379 for the jiffy.
