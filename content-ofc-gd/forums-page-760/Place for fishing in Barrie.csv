406085,richyb,2009-11-27 15:55:00,774,Im guessing you mean barrie?  I seen on the news that people were catching them at the docks down town a couple weeks ago.
406086,BillM,2009-11-27 15:56:00,17367,"Right in downtown... Launch the boat at the Tiffin launch and follow everyone else, lol."
406096,Cosmos,2009-11-27 16:15:00,588,"Sorry, yes of course - Barrie. Thanks, will give a try."

406122,Cosmos,2009-11-27 17:33:00,588,That's true. OK let's say I am looking for place to fish perch on Simcoe. Any good ideas????
406124,irishfield,2009-11-27 17:38:00,26272,No need to get so dressed up though.....      
406142,John,2009-11-27 18:43:00,2956, Simcoe? Ain't that due South of Brantford?
406144,John,2009-11-27 18:46:00,2956," I'm a sucker for a cutie with a rod in her hand........  Terry, what the heck are you doin' in your pocket bud?"
406156,NAW,2009-11-27 19:15:00,4022,"Do you have a boat, or are you fishing from shore?  From shore, hit the barrie docks.  From Boat, like it was said before, follow the crowd.  The perch fishing can be hit or miss in barrie.  Sometimes it's increadible, other times you'l only catch the odd dink."
406471,Cosmos,2009-11-29 01:09:00,588,"Thanks guys. Tried docks today. It was gold there, but perching was good. Minnows did a work today."
406474,misfish,2009-11-29 01:16:00,29133, Thanks for visiting our fair city.
406476,Cosmos,2009-11-29 01:27:00,588, Lakeshore view is awesome. Really nice place.
