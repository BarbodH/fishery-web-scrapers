405578,Eazy,2009-11-26 01:48:00,260,"Suppose you come to a pool, that is appoximately 15+', is it possible to fish this with a float set-up, or should you utilize other techniques such as bottom bouncing?"
405580,Twocoda,2009-11-26 01:54:00,4130,depends largely on how long your rod is ....size DOES matter..
405595,azebra,2009-11-26 02:19:00,168,"I have a 14 foot rod, I can run up to about 14 feet(13 better) with out it dragging on the ground and cast it. but prefer a slip float for deeper then that. but then again, I cant get the darn rubber line float stopper to get through my tip top guides on my cast with the float rod, any other spinning rod your fine. so yes you can fish 15+ with a Slip Float setup"
405604,Fishnwire,2009-11-26 02:31:00,983,"I'm not a trout guy, but I've used slip floats for bass, walleye and crappie in 15+ FOW with a spinning outfit.  I'm not trying to be a smartass but why couldn't you do the same with a float rod?  I know nothing about that kind of fishing so I'm curious to learn a little about it."
405606,Fishnwire,2009-11-26 02:33:00,983,  That kind of answers my question.  Sorry...I didn't read that before my post.
405608,azebra,2009-11-26 02:37:00,168,"well, speaking for myself. my tip top guide on my rod is so small, on a gentle centerpin cast i cant get the rubber float stopper to glide through the top guide. on lakes with my spinning rod, i could set it at any depth 100+feet.know what i mean. larger guides, deeper water.. plus on rivers. even the niagara with my float rod, 12 foot depth is all i use from shore.. thats all you need, cast into a seam, hold it for a couple seconds, let it drift, and BAM."
405618,BillM,2009-11-26 02:58:00,17367,"Sure you can fish it with a float setup..  It would be simple with a 15' rod    A little tougher with a 13', but if you have the room, it's not a huge deal..  Landing fish with a monster lead is a pain in the ass sometimes.."
405619,Flatbackdreamer,2009-11-26 03:03:00,17,What about the nylon stoppers??   these should easily pass through the tip section of any rod without any hangups.  Never used the rubber stops before but the nylon ones have never failed me.
405620,Bondar,2009-11-26 03:05:00,817,just run a small bead  above your float and tie your stop out of a piece of normal line the bead will slide up and stop on the piece of line you tied on your main line
405623,Eazy,2009-11-26 03:19:00,260,"Ah yes, I guess I kind of forgot about the slip, which would work good under these circumstances!"
405626,BillM,2009-11-26 03:24:00,17367,"We routinely run big leads (10ft+) without slips...  We were running close to, if not over 13ft leads a few weeks ago...  No slip no nothing..  just a normal float"
405630,Eazy,2009-11-26 03:30:00,260,I guess you'd have to get your roe pretty close to the bottom in order for them to see it even in clear water?
405679,Harrison,2009-11-26 13:30:00,2202,"Can be fun to watch a guy try and land a fish with a 15ft lead(myself included).  Especially when they have little or no room to move.  As for the float stop, try using a piece of spinnerbait rubber skirt, one or two grannies and it will usually fit through the tip eyes on float rods."
405683,cuzza,2009-11-26 13:50:00,467, Just what I was thinking as I read the original post - stop knot diagram.... http://www.pacgb.co.uk/tips/stopknot.html
405690,[emailÂ protected],2009-11-26 14:42:00,290, Its funner watching a guy try to pull a 10lb steelie out of the water 90 degrees straight up with a 6'6 spinning rod and 8lb line and then subsequently watching him fall into the river and watching his friends laugh at him as the steelie swims away doing jumps into the sunset.
405691,dave524,2009-11-26 14:43:00,4508," Braided type lines seem best for this , what I do is carry a small dispenser of dental floss in my float fishing vest, it is handy and works well. Haven't come to any firm conclusion about whether the waxed or unwaxed is better. Also , The tip of my float rod, I wound a guide on it as opposed to a regular tip top for the increased diameter, this was a common practice at one time."
405702,Garnet,2009-11-26 16:04:00,2056,You might have a larger bobber stop they come in 2 sizes. As suggested a regular guide for your tip will work.  Garnet
405712,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-26 17:19:00,0,"been fishing a very deep hole, the edges of it anyways.  been using a drennan piker or a drennan zeppler.  both work well in deep runs.  just remember, the fish are more likely to be on the edge of that deep, swift current than right in the middle of it."
405719,cuzza,2009-11-26 18:02:00,467, Agreed - although if you have to use monofilament then leaving longer tags helps the knot through the rings. I've used dental floss for all sorts of things too - un-waxed frays easily at the ends but is more flexible so waxed is probably better for stop knots
405766,Dabluz,2009-11-26 20:10:00,701,"For making stop knots, I think that using very soft monofilament would do the trick.  Monofilament ""ice line"" is very soft and should grab well onto the main line.  It's probably the only thing it is good at...lol."
405775,fishinguypat,2009-11-26 20:29:00,547,a few split shot until you feel bottom and let it have the same feel as if there were a float
406030,River Rat,2009-11-27 14:19:00,161,"if your guides are small and the rubber stops are a pain, you can use 65lbpower pro and just tie a uni know, wrap it like 10 times and it holds mainline well. They sell the little pre-tied slip ons too. I like bright colored dacron because I want to be able to see it against the float. Soemtimes a slip float will get a groove and the line will catch it, you won't see it if you can't see you float stopper.  P.S. I've run deep pools with a fixed float and IMO, the slip float is much easier to use.  Cheers  RR"
406157,wallyboss,2009-11-27 19:38:00,1095,  You should be able to  but I would ask the Life guard first and see if I can actually fish in his POOL
406161,canadadude,2009-11-27 19:50:00,769,Lots of methods mention here will work but me I'd bottom bounce it old school hahahaha
