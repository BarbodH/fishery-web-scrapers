405707,dave524,2009-11-26 16:47:00,4508,"You fellows would probably all be interested in this and maybe unaware that The Ministry of Natural Resources, ( back then it was the Department of Lands and Forests ) previous to 1968 used to do all their own training at a facility on Lake St. Nora near Minden, generally called the Forest Ranger School but in later years officially named the Leslie Frost Centre. I have many fond memories of this older facilty, not as a student of the program there but as a student of the undergraduate forestry program at the University of Toronto. Each spring, after the final exams, we would all head off there for a 3 week spring camp for practical field work. The undergraduate Forestry program was closed at U of T some years ago but a post grad program still continues. I completed my B.Sc.F in 1974. Some of you fellows may work with alumni of mine or maybe like me they are retired  For those of you interested this link give some of the early history of Forestry and Fish and Widlife education for Ontario.  http://www.frostcentreinstitute.com/history.html"

All my volunteer work in the past and even some since I started school here has been with the Central Lake Ontario Conservation Autnority. It might not be much but a reference and some feel for the work has kept me on the path I'm on today. Just asking around and letting people know what I'm all about got me into the Hatchery helping release those Atlantic's for the week while I was ""off school"".  I should be back there and come to think of it I might try to stop by again and say hello. Sometimes Ryan it's all it takes, if you are serious about what you are doing then tell me and when a opportunity comes my way I'll recommended you.  Good Luck on your path, MTBF"
