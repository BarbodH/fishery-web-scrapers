I know the owner of the camp has changed a number of times and I can't seem to locate a phone number. Gillies is just south of Tobermory. I want to go during the hard water season  see if I can get a laker and most importantly rekindle a few  great memories we had. I know the fishing was slow when I was there, has it changed at all? Any info about the camp,cabins or fishing would be great.  Thanks Todd."
