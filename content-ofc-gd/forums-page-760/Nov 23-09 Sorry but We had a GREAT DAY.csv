405259,spinnerbaitking,2009-11-24 22:51:00,1622,"I've had different people out this fall & out fished them all at first, when you have 5 or 10 nice smallies in the boat & they have 1, they start wondering what their doing wrong, 1st thing I did was gave them 1 of my rods & told them to slow down, I was using 8 lb Andes green line & a Smoke & Purple fleck tube fished really slow, If I was drifting I didn't get bit, too shallow 7 to 10 fow, so I was casting in front of the boat with the trolling motor on as slow as I could & still have control of the boat, let the tube hit bottom & give it slack line shake the tube 4"" to 12"" & reel down to it, work it back to boat & repeat, out of all the smallies we hardly felt any hits they just sucked it in & we felt weight & started reeling, the other rods they were using had Power Pro, 10lb Andes, 10lb Flouro Clear, 12 lb P-Line, the 2 - 10lb lines caught a few fish but not many, My father's cousin Pete used 6 lb light green on a 10' rod & had as many as I did on the day they fished but only caught 1, when I started catching fish I was roaring & every one around the lakes would have heard me, but especially the other guys fishing with us & then I'd wave them over to try catching the smallies & telling them to slow down or giving them my rods or tubes to get them on fish. I love catching fish but I also love to have my buddies catching them too. Water was colored a bit but could still see rocks or wood down to 5' to 8' Richard Not trying to blow my own horn but for some reason things just clicked for me this fall"
