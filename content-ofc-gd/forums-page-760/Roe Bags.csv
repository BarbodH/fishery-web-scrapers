405804,[email protected],2009-11-26 21:10:00,290,How do you guys put them on your hooks to maximize their life?  Sometimes I'll hook them on and they dissipate the first cast.   I go through alot of roe bags  Gotta stop somewhere on my way to the ole fishin' hole to pick up some bags.
405807,BillM,2009-11-26 21:22:00,17367,"You want to hook them right under the knot...  Also, if you have a bag with 4-5 eggs, make sure you puncture one when putting it on the hook.  All that gooey nastiness is a great attractant."
405808,[email protected],2009-11-26 21:24:00,290,  Thanks Bill  I will try that tonight.. Hopefully we can hook into some fish.  Bigger roe bags at night right?
405809,BillM,2009-11-26 21:28:00,17367,"Bag size is really dependent on water clarity....  If it's clear you'll wanna downsize some..  But make sure they are milking, every little bit helps."
405812,[email protected],2009-11-26 21:30:00,290,"Okee Dokee..  Ive got a bunch of stuff to throw at them tonight...  Roe, Pink Worms.. spinners.. spoons...  I shall prevail!"
405822,Twocoda,2009-11-26 22:11:00,4130,good attitude ....good luck ...
405892,xkempx,2009-11-27 01:06:00,84,I use a EGG LOOP knot. Have not lost a bag yet on this knot. 
405957,[email protected],2009-11-27 04:18:00,290,Got skunked.  Couldn't see the glowsticks on our floats due to the giant array of christmas lights reflecting off the water.  lol.
405963,Twocoda,2009-11-27 04:27:00,4130,HO HO HO Holy Crap is that the best excuse you have???
405964,splashhopper,2009-11-27 04:30:00,2931, I would use that one too... the way I am getting skunked on rainbows this year  Did u guys get rain there the last couple days?
405973,Twocoda,2009-11-27 04:45:00,4130,yep lots of rain ...its time ! again
406036,[email protected],2009-11-27 14:37:00,290,Yeah.  Is there a better technique to fish at night with Roe bags?  Wouldnt the bags be hard to see?
406271,BillM,2009-11-28 02:07:00,17367," These are fish   Don't think to hard about it...  How much light do you think penetrates into the water during the day time, especially if it's a bit dirty?  Fish have no problem chasing bait/eating roe bags at night..."
