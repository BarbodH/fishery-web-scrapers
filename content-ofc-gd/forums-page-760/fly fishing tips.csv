405036,BillM,2009-11-24 00:56:00,17367,Might also wanna check out hipwader.com  Almost all fly fishing related.
405039,Twocoda,2009-11-24 01:00:00,4130,anything pink or orange with lots of crystal flash ...or glo /nuke eggs are your next best bet...  Ill soon be putting the pin down and taking the dust off the flyrod....  welcome to the forum and Good Luck!
405041,vinnimon,2009-11-24 01:03:00,2593,"Youre local fly shop/specialist will give the best advice in your area.As per size and type.Sreamers would be a way to start.Or just go out to the stream your fishing and flip over a few rocks.Crawfish or stone nimphs would be a go.If there are a lot of shiners then go with that.A single egg wouldnt hurt at all.Most local shops will post on a billboard,water temp and fly types and sizes to go with.Good luck in your venture,see the pros first.Saves me a lot of homework."
405271,walleye_man,2009-11-24 23:19:00,135,thanks guys hopefully ill get myself a fly rod roon and start ....speeking of fly rods what type of rod do you sujest thanks alot again
405682,cuzza,2009-11-26 13:47:00,467,"Depends on where you're planning on going but a good starter would be a 9' to 9'6"" #6/7 weight rod with a medium or medium-fast action, add a 7 weight floating line (weight forward taper is easier to cast) and a reel and you're good to go.  Don't worry too much about the reel, it's a line store and not much else especially if you're trouting so spend your cash on a decent rod and line. If you can get someone to give you some casting lessons with your own gear once you have it, that'll help you along.  Twocoda - what are you fly fishing for in Decemeber????"
