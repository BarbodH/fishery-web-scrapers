405393,splashhopper,2009-11-25 14:38:00,2931,"  yeah.... the :""nudder ting"" I mean.... lol I think  I am looking for lake structure because i want to make some notes on the local places i fish due to my very poor memory bank I don't own a fish finder, but still would want the map even after I get one ( hopefully for christmas)  anyone got any of dem  ""nudder tings"" den ?"
405401,Raf,2009-11-25 15:08:00,3495,"i doubt you will find hydrographic maps for conservation areas.  only the major lakes/system tend to be charted (ie. great lakes, trent/severn, ottawa, st. lawrence).   your best bet would be to contact the conservation authority you are dealing with."
405414,johnnyb,2009-11-25 15:41:00,3413,"Local MNR offices also are likely to have lake surveys on file...not so much for navigation purposes, but at least contours of the lake, if locating fishable structure is your goal.  You can call ahead and ask if they'll make copies for you."
405439,rock34,2009-11-25 17:30:00,215,This is a GREAT site and has a tonne of lake maps.....Im not sure about conservation areas though.  http://www.anglersatlas.com/
405587,splashhopper,2009-11-26 02:05:00,2931,"  Amazing site  I haven't found the local lake I am looking for Toay, but I did find another one that I am also interested in.  Thanks"

Dont want to dis the others, BUT YOU BE THE JUDGE Cheers  Note. Some how in the past I was able to get a map picture for my topics, however I have forgotten  CHEERS Rob  http://www.touratel.com/"
405631,holdfast,2009-11-26 03:32:00,1813,"http://www.touratel.com/  I gave you the link again in case you didnt get my first post ( MOD Q) and I figured out how to post the map  To get pictures, save the picture of your map to favorites, then open it up from favorite and the copy/or send to folder of your choice.  for the examples below   Find Map/Favorites/Send to DESK TOP/  then I went to Photobucket   "
405675,bdox,2009-11-26 12:29:00,329,"I use ibycus topo because it's free and works with my garmin software and handheld. I find it pretty accurate, at least enough for light hiking.  http://www.ibycus.com/ibycustopo/"
