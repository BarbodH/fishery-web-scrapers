406077,solopaddler,2009-11-27 15:39:00,8605," You know maybe I should. Not sure how to pull it off yet though.    If anything the fishing is getting better, more and bigger fish. Maybe you should come down for another go at it."

406104,msp,2009-11-27 16:37:00,1336,"Nice report there Solo. My car has 500 000km on it from those ""dam""places. And people call the eastern rivers ""ditches""????. Those are the true ditches. quick question about that first spot..... Do you think that alot of those fish are strays from our side of the lake or do you think they are stockers from over there ? They seem pretty big for American stockers. They look kind of like a Ganny strain. Possibly a mix ?"
406106,solopaddler,2009-11-27 16:44:00,8605, That's an interesting question and one that we've discussed at length. The only way to be certain is to get a genetic profile done on the fish and that's not going to happen. Personally I believe very few of those fish are strays but are instead stocked on that side of the pond.
406111,strakey,2009-11-27 17:00:00,78,"Mike i had a joygasm looking at those pictures (to be specific, the pictures of the fish)"

405849,solopaddler,2009-11-26 23:25:00,8605," I've said it before too, but y'know you're welcome to join anytime bud.    There were some good stories here that I neglected to elaborate on. One in particular, I'd mentioned to Bill that small white jigs were the ticket. Scrambling at the last minute he had nothing white to use for his homemade tie's. That is until he spied his snow white cat. Out came the scissors and he quickly whipped off a couple of jigs for the next day's outing. He actually did catch a beauty brown on his creation which for obvious reasons he named the pussy jig."
