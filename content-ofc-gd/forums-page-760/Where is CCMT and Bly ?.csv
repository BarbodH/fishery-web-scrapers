405597,irishfield,2009-11-26 02:24:00,26272,Many OFC'rs come and go like waves.... and life with a busy family probably has them land locked.  I'm sure there's some magnificant outing for them just around the corner...

405713,Bly,2009-11-26 17:22:00,1556,"We are around.  Life has been very busy.  Cliff is and has been extremely busy at work.  Most of his past posts were made while he was at work, now he is actually working  lol    I am in a career transition and at this time, it means I am working 2 jobs along with being a wife, a mother and avid angler.   We are still fishing but it has been limited..I missed the Kawartha Musky closer because I was sick.  There has been a bit of ""eye"" results but again the trips have been limited..kids sick, weather and so on. Hopefully Cliff will post a report soon with a few pictures.   Ps  Snag.....14 lbs 3 ounces"

I figured y'all were busier than a couple one armed paper hangers!  I can sympatthize with the being sick stuff, I had the pnuemonia 3 weeks ago and it feels like I'm trying to relapse  Tell Cliff to sharpen up the auger blades, ice fishin' season is just around the corner!!!"
