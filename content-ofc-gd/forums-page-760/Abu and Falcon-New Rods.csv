405183,bassjnkie,2009-11-24 17:24:00,1101,"Was at BPS yesterday looking for a few rods, lucky I didn't buy, didn't see those though.  EDIT: Just called Bass Pro, they don't have those rods and will not be carrying them at all."
405184,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-24 17:28:00,0,"they are wild looking but i wonder if the appearance isn't more for appearance than it is for function...  and i agree with bill, i will never buy a rod without cork."
405340,EC1,2009-11-25 04:22:00,930,"mike, I've been looking at the Vendetta really hard...It looks like an awesome rod to me One concern is that the guides are questionable, so I will wait until around next bass opener before I go get a new rod.. And I think you'll have to order that rod online to get it..Or drive to the states.  I'll PM you a link you should look at regarding the quality and build of the rod."
405373,ADB,2009-11-25 13:15:00,444, Apparently Le Baron should be carrying them.  No details yet though.

405980,Garry2Rs,2009-11-27 06:17:00,1425,"When you live 30 minutes from Shimano Canada, and when Shimano has every rod at every price point that you could ever want, why would you invest in something that will be a warranty nightmare if you ever need service?"
