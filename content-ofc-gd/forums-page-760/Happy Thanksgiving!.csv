I can't imagine the damage that has been done to the bank account.  I decorated a big Pine tree in the back yard.  The boys (two of them) made some bird feeding christmas tree decorations yesterday, I had the job of hanging them and lighting the 20' Pine tree.  I used over 10 strands of LED's on the bad boy.  Can't wait for dark.  Need Beer...  Thanks for the well wishes, catch y'all soon."
406138,Raf,2009-11-27 18:24:00,3495,"swordfish, i have no beef with america(ns) however, ""here's to manifest destiny"" is going a little far donchya think?  manifest destiny is the belief that the US was destined to expand across the entire north american continent.  as a proud and sovereign canadian; the idea of manifest destiny is disagreeable to say the least.  we can ask the native american population what they think of manifest destiny as well.  anyhoo.. hope everyone south of the border is recovering from their food hangover."

Anybody between Barrie, Ontario and Grove City, Pennsylvania be on the look-out for a blue, late model CRV. Do not approach these women, they are armed with enough credit cards and discount coupons to do serious damage to anybody in their way.   Me? Four days of Yankee and Canadian football and all the chili I can eat! I love this holiday too."
405490,Rich Clemens,2009-11-25 20:41:00,3131,Thank ya folks.   Actually Patsy and I are not having a Thanksgiving dinner this year.  Our church offers a FREE Thanksgiving Day meal with all the trimmings to the community as an outreach event.  We're providing a good hot meal to those who otherwise may not get one or those who have no familiy coming in or any place to go.  We even deliver meals to those in the community who are shut-in or otherwise cannot get out.   You'd be surprised how many of your (our) own neighbors have little to eat - or what they may be eating that day.   It's a great time and that's how we'll be spending Thankgiving Day.

405863,siwash,2009-11-27 00:01:00,683,"GOD BLESS THE USA I can't stand all the America-bashing around the world these days...but it really pisses me off when it comes from Canadians! Anti-American bashing by Canadians is so moronic when you actually understand that this continent is more integrated than any other place on the planet... and there's nothing wrong with that... we are the beneficiaries...we're bashing ourselves when we bash Americans...  He's to manifest destiny!  All together now...  While the storm clouds gather far across the sea, Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free, Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer."
