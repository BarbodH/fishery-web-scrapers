141040,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-09 20:45:00,957,"Winter issue was delivered yesterday.  Moosebunk has a nice read about ice fishing on Kesagami Lake. His photos are great.  Sandy and JP sat out this issue, so we'll look forward to seeing their work in the Spring issue.  Bunk, thanks for another good article."
141042,irishfield,2007-12-09 20:48:00,26272,Have to wait for the dog sleds for ours Connie. See any other ugly OFC'rs in the picture section?
141064,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-09 22:26:00,957,All the OFC'rs I know are pretty.  Didn't see any other than Andrew.  Of course Pete has an article in the issue.  Jack Burns has stepped down as Senior Editor so he can spend more time on the water.
141066,irishfield,2007-12-09 22:30:00,26272,"Hmmm, did you look in the monsters of the month. Dan and I should have been in there..."
141070,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-09 22:54:00,957,"Yep, I stand corrected on two counts.  First, both you guys are in there.  Second, all the OFC'rs I know are not necessarily pretty.  Wayne in ""Angler Photos"" and Dan in ""Monsters""."
141218,Whopper,2007-12-10 12:00:00,2174,Dang I'm going to have to pat down the mailwoman today I think she is holding out on me. Thanks for the heads up Connie
141223,Roy,2007-12-10 12:22:00,13728,"Thanks for the info, Connie. Looking forward to Andrew's article as well as all the other great info in EA. I guess it'll be Mr. Wayne and Mr. Dan from now on."
141267,irishfield,2007-12-10 15:29:00,26272,Na... you and just you Roy can still call me Sir !
141467,Dano,2007-12-11 00:23:00,719,Nice! Cant wait to see it.
142098,Rich Clemens,2007-12-12 22:48:00,3131,Just got mine today ... man that Wayne sure  has a big head and a mouth full of teeth
143647,Pete Maina,2007-12-18 12:50:00,213,"Hi all,  Glad to hear that the dogsleds have finally started to show  As mentioned, it appears OFNER's may be gradually taking over  Andrew's article is great, as always ... and as always, some awesome pics to go along with it. You will notice an increase is ice info in general. Appreciate feedback on that. Expect that time of the year has arrived there too.  (Hopefully that patting down the mailwoman went OK for you whopper.)  Again, appreciate any feedback and love to get more photos from OFNer's ... you walleye and pike anglers too - for certain.  Pete"

144803,Moosebunk,2007-12-23 18:34:00,3970, I'd like to grab a second copy of the fall.  Maybe I'll time it perfect next week and be able to pick up both when I get to a Chapters myself.

144814,Marc Thorpe,2007-12-23 19:43:00,621,"Hey Moose,just thought I'd let ya know Bear got the sled,so have ta wait till next sled come around"

144837,irishfield,2007-12-23 20:55:00,26272,"One of these times Drew.. we'll get out. And I thought it was Smut Falls... ""Sin City"" to be exact."
