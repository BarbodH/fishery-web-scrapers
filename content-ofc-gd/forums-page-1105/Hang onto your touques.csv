144851,lew,2007-12-23 22:28:00,12767,The weather dude is calling for winds in the Toronto area to possibly hit over 90K tonight.  Could be nasty for anyone out for a moonlight stroll.....be careful if you need to go anywhere.
144853,Greencoachdog,2007-12-23 22:33:00,8163,"We had that wind yesterday, last night, and this morning Lew, and it wasn't very nice!  You and ol' Marv bundle up tomorrow morning when y'all take your early morning stroll."
144855,lew,2007-12-23 22:35:00,12767,"Thanks Glen, maybe I better add some weights to Ole' Marv to keep him on the ground"
144858,pikehunter,2007-12-23 22:37:00,1659,"It's nasty out now. It got real nice and sunny this afternoon and I heard the wind gusting and blowing so I looked out and the spruce tree out in the back corner of my backyard was swaying like crazy. Looked at the thermometer and the temp had dropped to the mid 30's. Wife says that her car needs gas and I knew my van was on ""E"" so off to the gas station we went. 101.7 at Pioneer in the Hammer. $81 more on my debit card soon to be overdrawn ounce again   But what ya gonna do  It was trying to snow on the way to the gas station. Wife said the weather network is calling for snow tonight and the full red warning screen on the TV was up.  You're right Lew, it's time hunker down."

144881,Joey,2007-12-23 23:34:00,9122,"Yep Lew, I just finished Bar-b-quing and had a hard time with the flame.  Didn't blow out but had it on full blast and it didn't cook very fast.  I'll stay put I think.  Thanks for the heads up.  Joey"
