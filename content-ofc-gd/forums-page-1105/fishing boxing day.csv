145236,Mike the Pike,2007-12-24 23:40:00,3421, Paul is going to be cold enough for ya Terry   Better watch out old Jed is up to somethin.
145240,glen,2007-12-24 23:48:00,2641,I have drilled a few holes the last few days.  The ice is terrible.  You may find ice that will hold you but there is no good ice.  ATV on simcoe is  not for me.  There is ice then slush and then snow and ice on top of that.  Its a real mess.  Ice fishing is off to a slow start.
145246,fishindevil,2007-12-25 00:26:00,6254,"IT seems that the reports are all so varied,terry !!!! ive heard guys say that there is lots ,and then guys saying that the ice is 3inches in place so it must depend on what area you are going to,,,its such a big lake i mean look at how the ice can vary,what we all need is pictures,of some ice thickness,as in a certain area it would give a preety good idea of how much there im wanting to go as well,this weekend but dont know about all the areas either?????"
145252,Terry,2007-12-25 00:36:00,14456,I don't have a spud so it would be too much work to drill a hole every 10 feet on the way out.....  oh well I will wait and see how it looks
145266,tjsa,2007-12-25 01:13:00,1578,"Terry, think of it this way. No matter now much you want to get out fishing, and wanting to use your quad to get there, .........is it INSURED  for said purpose? Usually insurance companies will want you to have an ""all perils"" policy on ice. My quad insurance does not have that, nor does my snowmobile which I have owned since 1990, and I drive both of them on ice. But, I make sure that the ice is solid, and I am not going to encounter any problems. If its not 1.5 ft. thick, I do not take my machines on the ice. I was out fishing last saturday, and the report was 12"" of ice, thats lots for a snowmobile or quad, but ice thickness varies on location, so we walked out.  Do you want to take that chance with your quad, it is only about a year and a bit old now, isn't it? Cost you about 6 grand or more????  Play it safe, no matter what."
145269,misfish,2007-12-25 01:52:00,29133,"Ok you can stop rubb,n it in anytime bud,  Spud bars are for the first of the season,a must have."
145270,Terry,2007-12-25 02:01:00,14456,"yeah, I know..but I have a need to get out..LOL  Brian, the last time I used my spud bar I thought the ice was thicker and one light smack and it went through the ice and never stopped..lost my grip and away it went....guess I will need to buy another one"
145271,fishindevil,2007-12-25 02:02:00,6254,"Terry a new spud bar is about $25 bucks man !!!!! .....it did save my life once ....when i fell in,through the thin ice,i was in about 8ft of water my spud bar was on my wrist,with the little rope that comes with it...and i used the spud bar to push on the bottom of the lake to get me back on top of the ice....it was along walk back to the truck man !!!! i was frozen solid...anyway sorry for rambling on,like brian said a spud is essential for first ice !!!!! you should have asked santa for one terry ...LOL..LOL"
145272,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-25 02:04:00,0,They are driving on the ice from Virginia to the island. Im sure its OK for a quad. Ejoy your day. I heard even out by Port Bolster there is a few good inches of ice. You can get out to 20 fow no problem. Hey if ya go through...Your machine floats doesnt it??
145274,irishfield,2007-12-25 02:17:00,26272,Pump up the tires Terry...
