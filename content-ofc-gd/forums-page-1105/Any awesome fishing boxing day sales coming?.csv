144842,silveradosheriff,2007-12-23 21:20:00,1025,"Just wondering if anyone knows what BPS, Lebarons, Fishing World etc. are doing for boxing day sales?"
144849,iceguy,2007-12-23 22:20:00,341,You never stop looking for deals eh! Lebarons has tax off usually on boxing day but not sure if you can use in conjunction with  the 20% club membership.What are you looking for? I can see you buying a nice marine radio.
144861,silveradosheriff,2007-12-23 22:39:00,1025,So much tackle...so little time!
144862,mikeh,2007-12-23 22:41:00,824,"not a boxing day special, but I just bought a curado 301dsv for $230 , taxes and shipping included. (no extra charges). I thought this was a good deal"
144895,Fisherman,2007-12-24 00:13:00,7201,BPS is having a 1 day sale for certain items on the 26th and then another that runs from the 26th to Jan 6. Got my flyer a couple days ago.
144896,irishfield,2007-12-24 00:14:00,26272,Spend boxing day with your family... may give you a pass card for a day of fishing in the spring! LOL
144903,silveradosheriff,2007-12-24 00:32:00,1025,I'll take the kids shopping - major brownie points!
144907,irishfield,2007-12-24 00:44:00,26272,
144930,bassboy,2007-12-24 02:30:00,161,"  mike.....when did you buy it?  Reason I ask is that Shimano has a rebate on now on Curado ($50), Citica ($30) and Cruxis ($20). Started Dec 17 and runs till April 30 2008. I believe its only good for stuff bought in Canada though. I bought a Curado 200 DHSV from Lebaron for $182.35 (with the 20% club member discount) and then the $50 back from Shimano, brings it down to $132.35 before taxes.......was going to buy a Citica until the guy told me about the rebate.  I think its safe to say one would be hard pressed to find a Curado for that price..... LeBarons club deal ends tomorrow though.....after that its only 10% off and no tax on Boxing day....  Not sure if I should have bought the DHSV or the DHV but have the DHSV for now......  A good deal in my books......and not meaning to poo poo on your deal.......no offense   Bill"
144934,danc,2007-12-24 02:35:00,4677, Right on Wayne. I don't care if they're giving away everything for free. You won't see me in the lineup.
145141,danbo,2007-12-24 18:05:00,2646,No tax at LeBarons on Boxing Day
145167,lookinforwalleye,2007-12-24 19:52:00,4399,I went to BPS last boxing day and I said never again it was taking some people over an hour just to get out of the parking lot.
145203,mikeh,2007-12-24 21:04:00,824,"Bassboy, I bought it a couple of weeks ago on ebay from the states. I worked out the savings you mentioned with the rebate and the 20 % discount for members I could have saved $18 more compared to lebaron's. lebaron's price for the curado 301dsv is $293, whereas the 201dsv is $227. Thanks for letting everybody know about the rebate, we all like to get bargains on our gear  ."
145204,irishfield,2007-12-24 21:12:00,26272,I keep seeing this 20% discount for members from LB's. When did it go up from 7% ?
145205,Terry,2007-12-24 21:18:00,14456,they changed it to 10% with the current sale it raises some things to 20%
145206,bassboy,2007-12-24 21:22:00,161," Its 20% up until today....I guess a pre-christmas thing. However....the 7% has now gone up to 10% from now on.......the place on the back of my card that read 7% has been crossed off in pen and written over with 10.   Either one is ok with me.....I already got my membership fee back, and I only joined last Thursday LOL    Mike.....I didnt notice the price on the 301......only looked at the 200. The salesman told me that Shimano had also dropped their prices to the dealers in keeping with the Candian/US dollar situation.......Had he not mentioned all of this I would be the proud owner of an Citica......which is still ok.....  Either way it sounds like you got a great deal too!!  WTG!  Bill"
