If anyone has seen this movie, could you please give me your opinion on it. Reading from the comments it seems pretty good. I did check the TCM list and it is not airing. I would like to buy a used VHS copy. Does anyone have any idea were I might be able to find one? Hopefully somewhere near downtown Toronto.
