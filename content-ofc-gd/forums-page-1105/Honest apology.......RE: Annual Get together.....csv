I was supposed to attend that function but I pulled out at the last second and really made things complicated for some people (Gerritt & Bassmaster Mike) in terms of logistics. I am very sorry to all members who attended and I am sincerely sorry to Gerritt and Bassmaster Mike for throwing a loop in their plans. I should have bit the bullett and went, but I let my emotions get the best of me. Again, I am very sorry and I would like to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas and a even Happier New Year!!!!   Sincerely,  Grant"

You may have to endure a little razzin' about it from time to time, but that just means they still like you... and if they never spoke another word to you, it means they weren't worth worrying about anyway.  Merry Christmas!"
