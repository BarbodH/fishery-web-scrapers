144593,cisco,2007-12-22 16:10:00,597,OK the Canadian dollar is up on par with the US dollar. Up 40% or so from only a short time ago.  The world crude oil price is in US dollars per barrel. So can anyone here explain why we're still paying the same here in Canada for gasoline and stuff which comes from crude oil?  I would think the price per litre here in Canada should drop to like.... $.65 or at least $.75 per litre.
144595,Terry,2007-12-22 16:14:00,14456,ah....because of Canadian taxes or is it because they have to add ethanol  to it or maybe because they need to add bilingual instructions  or they like the profits
144596,irishfield,2007-12-22 16:16:00,26272,They're using the excess profits to fund the million dollars they gave Gore for his hoax cause?
144600,Cookslav,2007-12-22 17:12:00,1457,"Cause we'll pay it...  Sucks but its true. Its a total farse, and we can complain all we like, but at the end of the day the only people who could stop the insanity are profiting from the increased prices as well(AKA...our government)  So aside from it ""possibly"" becoming and election issue next time around there is no incentive for them to act, and zero chance anything will be done.  The only way its going to come down is if we carp enough over the next few years to make it a top election issue, but.... Then again how often do politicians keep their word anyway?  Depresing but true... "

144719,SBCregal,2007-12-23 06:03:00,688,"if ywe keep buying it at this price, why would they lower it?"
144758,Greencoachdog,2007-12-23 14:22:00,8163,Sux to be y'all eh?
144768,Tootsie II,2007-12-23 14:52:00,162,"I believe the combined federal and provincial sales and other taxes in Ontario on a litre of gas add up to about 36 cents a litre. So take that away and there's your 75 cents a litre. In the States, there are virtually no such taxes with the possible exception on California which may have some that amount only to a couple of cents a litre."
144797,John Bacon,2007-12-23 18:13:00,3277," The price of a barrel of oil has increased from about $65 to about $95.  The price of a barrel of oil in Canadian dollars has not dropped; thus, no drop in oil prices.  In fact, it is the increase in the price of oil that is driving out dollar up.  Canada is an exporter so as the price of oil increases so does our dollar."
144960,Cookslav,2007-12-24 03:39:00,1457, And here I thought it was our strong economy...  LOL!
