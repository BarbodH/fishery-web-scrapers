144937,bpsbassman,2007-12-24 02:40:00,941,"Damn, the first year I'm available between Christmas and New Years!! You can't please all the people all the time........................................."
144939,Gerritt,2007-12-24 02:45:00,6129,"Roger,  Just seemed like too many people complaining about the dates etc.. Everyone with their own agenda I suppose...  so there wont be the traditional Christmas swill this year... it will wind up being a mid-march swill because the same thing will happen come January once I post it again...   dang.."
136300,Gerritt,2007-11-23 16:58:00,6129,Ok here is the poll..  Fridays and Saturdays they have no specials and we will have to see if they can reserve the space for us..  Tuesday's as most know are 2 for 1 wing nights.  Here is the link to the Restaurant  http://www.thefirehall.ca/  Gerritt.  Majority rules here folks.
136301,tonyb,2007-11-23 17:04:00,1637,Call and ask for Doug and see if he can honour the 2 for 1 wings on whatever night we decide to bring him lots of business
136302,Gerritt,2007-11-23 17:09:00,6129,just called...friday and saturday's are pretty much all booked up guys... Doug was not in but I spoke to the manager in charge... so I guess we have our answer..??   :dunno:  But she will get back to me...   Gerritt.
136312,bpsbassman,2007-11-23 18:29:00,941,What about between Christmas and New Years?  More people would be off and traffic wouldn't be as heavy for people coming across/through T.O. (or elsewhere for that matter).
136314,BITEME,2007-11-23 18:31:00,1969,  Im into that as well even jan feb for that matter
136346,Jeff R,2007-11-23 20:02:00,94,"sounds like a good night Gerritt, will have to check work schedule to see if I can do a trade or might even have night off"
136352,huntervasili,2007-11-23 20:24:00,1604,hmmm... I will take a peek at my work schedule to although it doesn't look too promising with Christmas parties starting up now...
136354,John,2007-11-23 20:27:00,2956,Sounds like a stellar idea! I'm up for Tuesday the 11th. Between Christmas and New Year would work too.   
136588,Tarzan's Jane,2007-11-24 06:22:00,1183,"Hey Gerritt...I won't be attending, but I just had to comment on your cute little guy there in blue...could this be you...I mean with the leg thing that you have going...lol"

136754,motv8tr,2007-11-24 22:40:00,2587,"Alas once again I will have to pass due to work   I have Monday/Tuesday off at that time, and have to be back to work Wed morning at 5:30   One of these years I'll make it.  Maureen"
136761,fishindevil,2007-11-24 22:55:00,6254,"Well i would think that you would have more people show up if it was on the weekend.  ....as lots of people work shift work,and would not be able to make it,or is my thinking wrong,there is people who cant do it on weekdays,cause of children babaysitters,work in the morning,etc,etc.....thats just my opinion,cause we want as many to come as we can right ????   cheers     shawn"
137248,Crazyhook,2007-11-27 00:55:00,1154,15th is my only chance being from out of town
137260,Gerritt,2007-11-27 01:35:00,6129,"OK guys... the problem is this... they cannot seat us due to them already being booked on the weekends for Xmas parties etc... (tis the season, I also mentioned this above)... looks like it is going to have to wait till the new year if you guys want it on a weekend... But to be honest we have always done these G2G things on the Tuesday @ the Firehall normally....  Looks like it will have to wait till 2008. Atleast I tried....  Gerritt."
137331,SBCregal,2007-11-27 04:56:00,688,any time there's a leafs game they have a special with a jug of beer and a platter of wings....just an idea if you're looking for a special on a different night.  and you get to watch the leafs lose!
137497,pigeonfisher,2007-11-27 19:59:00,696,"You can please some people, sometime.  You can't please all the people, all the time!"
137505,Kirk,2007-11-27 20:15:00,347,"You can still have the christmas party in the New Year:  Armenian Christmas is January 6, 2008  problem solved"
137508,misfish,2007-11-27 20:17:00,29133, The jug is so you can drown yer sorrows.
137960,huey graphite,2007-11-29 14:55:00,362,"  Hey Gerritt, The poll shows the majority of the votes were for Tuesday Dec 11th. Is it being postponed 'til January due to lack of people able to commit?  (Bump)"
137966,tonyb,2007-11-29 15:39:00,1637,Almost forgot about this picture  
137970,Gerritt,2007-11-29 15:56:00,6129,10 people commited to showing on Tuesday...  And too many complaints about the day.. I would rather see everyone get together without any hard feelings...  But if a few of use just want to meet on the Tuesday (Not booking the space) we could also do that..  Gerritt.
137973,tonyb,2007-11-29 16:09:00,1637,Can't please everyone all the time Gerritt...
138004,Carp,2007-11-29 19:14:00,1488,"Let's put it off until they can accomodate us on a weekend.  Some out of town members wouldn't have to wory about getting home early for work the next day. Some can make a weekend trip out of it.  I'm pretty busy between now and Christmas, so a weekend in January would suit me just fine.  Cheers"
138006,Gerritt,2007-11-29 19:17:00,6129,Case and point.....  Gerritt.  If you want to show up on Tuesday though for some wings and beer... well I guess Convinced! LOL..
