I'm not accustomed to being in the position I am now, so the generosity shown by a particular member left me quite astounded. It is very heartwarming to know we have such decent and caring people here. Thank you so much and Merry Christmas!!!"

145291,taper,2007-12-25 05:26:00,611,"I also have a pretty good idea who Santa might be and although I have yet to meet him face to face I know there are few as thoughtful as him, and just as few as deserving as you. I know you were the second OFNer I ever met and after 10 minutes of meeting you you gave me a brand new lure because I couldn't find one at the tackle shops. What comes around always goes around. Nice to see."
