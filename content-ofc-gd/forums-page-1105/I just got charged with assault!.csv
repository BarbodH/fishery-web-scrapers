139951,Grandman,2007-12-05 22:38:00,31,Terry- I know what you're saying.  I was shi*ing my pants in the cop shop at 4:30 in the morning being interviewed by two 6'2-250 pound officers that figured I had beat a woman.
139955,steve_paul,2007-12-05 23:04:00,658,Good to hear that this teste situation seems to be working out.
139956,drwxr,2007-12-05 23:08:00,453,you very lucky that charges got droped 1.saved a lot of time 2.saved a lot of money 3.avoided a lot of stress  i still suggest to go to the crown and get the restraining order

145017,F7Firecat,2007-12-24 13:01:00,347,"Fester,  please update me  is the restraining order still intact? What did she get charged with???? Should be sexual assault!!  good thing is its just you and her. There are no kids to have to deal with, youd never get away from her then. Imagine if kids where involved, you would have to deal with her pretty much for the rest of your life, probably wouldnt be a good thing!!!!  She assaulted you once, she may do it again. Would want that to happen, as you may lose it eventually and tune her up. Good thing you are done with her.  Heck Im sounding like a father here. LOL  Maybe I will just shut up!!! What do I know, I just like to musky fish!!  Just call me ""pa"" if you wish  Bryan  "

If I hooked 'er good in the mouth with a good hookset, and she shows me some good moves in the weedbed, and comes out a trophy, I won't hestitate to show a pretty head.  But if I end up hookin' 'er in the arse, and she get's all tangled up in my prop, I cut the line and let 'er lose.  Don't show the pictures where you have shanked 'em in the eye."

I know what its like to be on the recieveing end in an abusive relationship.  I refused to call the police because here in Canada the law punishes the victim.  Like I said before.....its ok to attack...illegal to defend.

139612,irishfield,2007-12-04 23:15:00,26272, Everyone's allowed a fantasy or two !
139691,POLLIWOGG,2007-12-05 02:09:00,835,"I was expecting a cop.  Buddy blew by a cop with his 340 duster at around 140 mph on his way home, he was asleep when the cop pulled him out of bed by the hair and beat him up. Must have been almost 30 years ago."
139702,Tarzan's Jane,2007-12-05 02:35:00,1183,"I definitely have mixed feelings here...I have never had the pleasure or displeasure of grabbing a hold of those dangly things in a ""rough"" way...definitely no excuse for that kind of behaviour unless you did something awfully nasty to her and she lost her mind for those few minutes.  (it does happen guys) So...if a woman is asleep in her bed, and a man breaks in and rapes her...can she not grab ahold of those danglies and tear them off...or would she be charged with assault. I hope that all works out for you.  She will hopefully come to your defense and make this go away ... hopefully.   Good Luck."
139705,Joey,2007-12-05 02:42:00,9122,"A friend of mine had his ex ""surprise"" him one night on her Birthday, at his house, and found him in bed with someone else.  Notice I said Ex.  She did the dangly grab and used her nails.  She was charged with break and enter and assault, so I don't understand why you were the one charged.  I'd fight it all the way."
139706,pikehunter,2007-12-05 02:46:00,1659,Sounds like you're being victimized twice.   I hope it all works out well for you. Strange how some things happen.
139709,Rich,2007-12-05 02:56:00,3927,"Well Steve, I have to say I saw something like this coming for a while. Not surprising."
139761,drwxr,2007-12-05 05:30:00,453,"just get a good lawyer, by good i mean the one that knows how to turn this thing around... drop all your charges, counter charge your ex, and get ""reimbursement"" for the damage. it will help you to cover the lawyer fees, which will be around 5k in your case. also go to the doctor and complain about the pain, doctors notes help in the court very much.  as for why cops do that, simple...this simple case will take out lots of money from the city to pay the cops that attent the court, the crowns and the prosecutors. everyone will be paid. dont sweat about it... its politics."
139774,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-05 11:52:00,2585,counter charge her for sexual assault sounds like a good idea to me.
139913,doubleheader,2007-12-05 19:27:00,497,"It was 1986. I was in N. J. attending my father-in laws funeral. I took my 7 and 10 yr old nephews down to the local lake after the funeral for a swim. Three teen age boys showed up and started verbally abusing my nephews on a floating dock just off the beach. I called my nephews in. The punks followed. I asked them once to drop it and they continued. I lost my cool and ripped them good verbally. They ran home to get their Dad and I made the big mistake of staying there to clear things up. Dad came running down the trail. He's 5'8"" and overweight, I'm 6', and in triathlon shape.  Rather than listen to what transpired he attempted to bully me. I never touched him but everytime he tried to push me I stepped forward and he went backward. He quickly got the idea and left the scene. We walked back to my mother-in -laws house, a number of guests were still at the house. In about 5 minutes the police showed up, handcuff me, and took me away. I was charged with aggrevated assault. That carried a fine of up to $10,000 and 2 yrs in jail. I pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. I had to get a laywer. A year went by before my trial, and many a night I'd wake up wondering ""If I can be arrested for aggrevated  assault without touching anybody I can just as easily be convicted?"".  The day of the Hearing my lawyer asked for a postponement because he was completely unprepaired. It was a 620 mile round trip for me to N.J. (Eventually this guy got disbarred on a drug conviction but I never got a dime back of the $2,000.00 retainer.)  In the end I hired a 2nd attorney, made another trip to NJ, and was acquitted as the liers stories didn't hold-up under questioning.  What I took away from this whole mess was 1. Never do anything that could conceivably get you on the wrong side of the law, 2. While you may be innocent until proven guilty you surely aren't going to escape the pain (financially and emotionally), 3. Don't be quick to assume others are quilty when they are charged with a crime.  Sorry for the length, 21 years later and it still haunts me."
139914,Terry,2007-12-05 19:46:00,14456,"doubleheader, I feel your pain  and no matter what you say to the cop...it seems he made his mind up the first few second he got there and you end up in handcuffs.........we all know not all cops are like that but it doesn't take many bad cops to make you wary of all of them.... and little if any trust in the whole system...too bad when the innocent has to be afraid of the men in blue....."
139915,pikehunter,2007-12-05 20:02:00,1659,"Yes it is very difficult to have very much faith in the system if any at all. The innocent get charged, the guilty stay free to pursue what they wish while the innocent are left hanging in limbo. If you have ever been charged wrongly you will agree that you are ""guilty until proven innocent"" and not the other way around. So if wrongly charged then that hangs over you and the feeling of helplessness lasts until at least the charge is withdrawn and as said, the financial cost one bears. Sometimes these results live with you for a lifetime.  I guess that our system isn't perfect but then which one is?"
139344,Grandman,2007-12-04 10:29:00,31,"I just got back from the 'cop shop'.  It's 5:30am.  Apparently, pushing someone off of you after they woke you up by pulling you out of your bed by your nuts and proceeding to kick you in the face is illegal.  HUH.  Yup,,,,,"
139346,HTHM,2007-12-04 10:53:00,4082,Get a good lawyer. This is serious.

139443,Headhunter,2007-12-04 16:40:00,5703,"You know, after getting them snipped, you don't really feel that much any more so why not go out and get er done and save yourself future grief! They're still attached, just not a ""vocal""! Were you sitting on a white bucket in your bed? HH"
139444,tapout,2007-12-04 16:40:00,166,"I sorta know the feeling grandman.  Can't really comment on your situation but that seems to be justice...Canadian style.  About 5 years ago I was attacked by a family member, it was in the morning and he threw his tea on me because I didn't want to hear about his arguement with another family member.  Well that didn't go over well with me and of course a ""struggle"" ensued.  I defended myself but can say I didn't throw one punch as this family member is quite a bit older.  He though did.  Anyway Peel's Finest showed up.  No charges we're laid but I...hear that..ME, MOI, I got the warning from the police.  I then said, "" SO what your saying is I am not allowed to defend myself?""  They refused to answer, and then cited that the courts will not care and will look at me being younger, bigger, and stronger, therefore at fault.  I was flabbergasted.  What I gathered from them is..."" Its ok to attack someone as long as they are younger, bigger and stronger.  If they defend themselves then they get charged.""  what the heck is up with that?  And people wonder why so many people have little trust or faith in the police or justice system.  For the record, I trust the police as a whole alot more then the justice system.  One recent case in point was the gang busts earlier this year in the Jane/Finch area.  Kudos to the Police for their great operation.  But then the courts ordered the prosecution to pay X number of ""detainees"" 2000 dollars each for not getting their bail hearings in 3 days.  again...what the heck?  There should be exceptions when the case involves violent gangs, weapons, or hardcore drugs - in such cases of mass arrests. A clearly documented violent gang has many of its members taken off the street and are then paid....handsomely I might add.  Wonder what those members will do with that money?  Replace the gun that was taken from them by the police?  Buy more of their""product"" to sell?  If I remember wasn't there an Ontario based lawyer that used to frequent the board? Not sure of his name but if hes still around maybe he can give some advice.  Cheers all."
139472,bassjnkie,2007-12-04 17:37:00,1101," I know some law, same happened to me. It's not fair at all, but it what the courts believe. I got into a brawl with 2 16year olds (I was 19) while doing security. One I knock right out and the other I hit and cuffed. I was at fault because I was bigger and stronger, blah,blah,blah. Thank god for good lawyers and have no record, it's like it never happened, like a dream. LOL  Daniel OCH"
139475,Terry,2007-12-04 17:43:00,14456,"yup, some years ago I caught 2 guys breaking into my parents  car I stopped them they decided to beat me up.. surprise..I got the better of them  cops showed up, because they didn't get around to getting anything out of the car the cop decided not to lay charges on them, but give them a warning  but was charging me with assault ...   an old lady from across the street came over  and told the cops that she saw them attack me, not me attack them..so he let me go with a warning....what a stupid cop.......sure makes it hard to respect them or trust them"
139479,pigeonfisher,2007-12-04 17:56:00,696,One of the strangest posts ever...
139482,tapout,2007-12-04 18:01:00,166,"Hey Terry,  did the officer end up charging them with assault or let them go?  Your neighbour saw it therefore an eye witness.  Tony."
139484,brickNblock,2007-12-04 18:10:00,598," Yes Terry...how old were you then tho???????? Something very similar happened to me back about 18yrs ago or so... I looked a lot different then and different mindset....... Long story very short.... I was at spring baseball tryouts.... My 2 boys ( age 3 & 7)in the park playing very close by were swarmed and assautlted by some older youths. It made the front page of the paper....they called it the ''""DonnyBrook on Liverpool"".. I effectively not only caught up withthese youths but a father of one as well. I was charged...11 counts of assault.. 2 of them most likely will never eat right again..there were 6 youths total. Once the police finally got the hospital report  from my brother...also there who tookmy boys to hospital.. Also my father..... The coppers say to me.... OK, OK...we will drop these charges if you dont lay any yourself. Reason was........ If we layed the charge.. These idiots youngsters would get our address and make life a living pile of..... the coppers however laid charges on my two boys behalf.... Ive all the respect in the world for the police when it finally ends like that.  It can be a pain in the butt when your involved in anything...but sincerely...whats the cops going to do. I think they just remove what they percieve to be a threat at the time as a starting place.  You read it right...11 assault charges...only 6 youths+ one father.... There are multiple degrees of assault once some are removed by ambulance. As to why I didnt immediately go to the hospital w/ my boys...... They had been held down and were force poured a substance from a bottle and with family there to take them to hospital...I wanted that bottle for its contents...coulda been turpentine or anything else."
139497,Terry,2007-12-04 18:41:00,14456,"I never did find out if any charges were laid..I don't think so once the officer said he would let me go with a warning, because the eyewitness, I just left and never heard another thing  one of the guys were 2 years younger then me the other was 1 year younger, both were bigger then me"
139518,Grandman,2007-12-04 19:43:00,31,I was sleeping in my bed at my house.   It was an ex girlfriend who decided to break into the house @ about 2:30 am.
