145032,pigeonfisher,2007-12-24 13:22:00,696,Dang Rick.  We had a big one with one of our cats a couple years ago.  He just woke up from a nap on my chest!  Gotta love'm.  Sorry to hear about the divorce also.
145081,trapshooter,2007-12-24 15:27:00,1234,Sorry to hear that Rick.  Best wishes.
145110,DebS,2007-12-24 16:29:00,56,"Rick, You absolutely did the right thing for Jack! It's a shame that veterinary services are so darn expensive but I've done the same thing with my Golden. All I care about is that she's taken care of & I'll worry about the money later.... A person who cares about their dog is a person with a compassionate nature. When Jack is up & around again you'll know that you did your best for him & he'll thank you for it with some big, wet, sloppy kisses I'm sure.  I'll send lots of good wishes your way on Thursday! DebS"
145114,hawkeye,2007-12-24 16:45:00,162,Man I feel for you.  I had to put my 15 year old Main Coon to sleep last week and that about tore me to pieces.  Best of luck to you  Bob
145115,shane,2007-12-24 16:50:00,652,Best wishes and thoughts to you and Jack.  Hope it all goes for the best.
145121,Bernie,2007-12-24 17:14:00,3190,Hi Rick. Sorry about your pooch. I know how you feel about him.  I know I would have no choice either. Hope all goes well in the future for you and Jack. Take care and have a Merry Christmas.
145122,lovetofish,2007-12-24 17:32:00,500,"My little buddy is only 7 months old right now and i already have grown to be very attached to him as well... can't imagine loosing him either.  I worked in animal hospital for five years and i know they treat animals better then we get treated when we go to the hospital....  So don't worry, he'll be fine.   best wishes,   lovetofish"
145125,Garyv,2007-12-24 17:38:00,547,Been there with Amy twice to the tune of $4000.....if Jack means that much to you then the right choice was made.  You can replace the money but not the dog.  Hope all works out well.
145127,TJQ,2007-12-24 17:40:00,7806,Hes lucky to have you bud....

Money is not an issue when it comes to my pets health and well being.  Rest yourself, and try to have a Merry Christmas.  John"
145023,Dano,2007-12-24 13:12:00,719,"Hang in there Jack! Sounds like my dog Misha, she doesnt do pain very well either, but likes to think she is tough. I would have made the same decision you did Rick, dont fret, he'll be allright."
