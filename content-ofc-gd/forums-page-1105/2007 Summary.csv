144966,mason05,2007-12-24 04:04:00,258,"Thought I'd post a quick review of my 2007 fishing season. To start, my annual trip to Algonquin in May.      A few specks...    Several more specks...    Fat Laker caught in 3 feet of water on an X-Rap near a waterfall in the early morning.  Wasn't expecting this fella.  Towed my canoe around for almost 1/2 an hour before he gave up.      Next up a few pike from my local spot in June...            Visited Muskoka with my family for a week in September and the largemouth fishing was on fire...  Here's my pops with a typical largie...          Last trip of 2007 was another visit to Algonquin.  Found the remnants of a cabin on a small island.  Only item left standing over the years...    A shot of our island residence for the week...    I hope 2008 is as good as 2007 has been.  Have a great Christmas followed by a happy and safe new year everyone! Cheers,  Corn Nug"
