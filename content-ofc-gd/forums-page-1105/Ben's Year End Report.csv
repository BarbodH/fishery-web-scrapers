144378,Ben_Daniels,2007-12-21 16:17:00,435,Well I didn’t get to fish a whole lot this year but still had a great time. I only got out 10 or 12 times but caught some awesome fish. Fast tracking through college and doing summer semesters doesn't leave me much time for fishing anymore doh . This was my second year living and fishing in Ontario after moving here from Florida. Its awesome going fishing here and being able to catch so many different fish.  I did most of my fishing in Toronto around the downtown area and in the Toronto Islands in the Spring and Summer...   First Bowfin   PB Pike 38 inches       My big bass of the year   First Brown Trout   I did manage to get up north to the Land O Lakes region for two days and had a pretty good time.   PB Smallie 3 lbs.   Mmmm I got my fish fry for 2007….  So all in all even though I didn’t get out that much this year it was a really good year and I had a great time up here. I had a lot of first’s and personal bests and I can’t wait until the ice is out so I can do it again!  -Ben
