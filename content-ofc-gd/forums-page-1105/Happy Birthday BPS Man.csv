144698,bpsbassman,2007-12-23 02:50:00,941,"Thanks all, much appreciated. One of my co-workers came into BPS today and wished me a Happy Birthday.  I asked him how he knew and he said it was on OFC.  Jeez, nothing's a secret anymore Birthday's aren't much fun anymore, but the older you get, the more you appreciate the really important things in life like good friends including my ""little internet friends"" Brian, I am working tomorrow and get lunch around 2:00.  Would love to meet up with you guys."
