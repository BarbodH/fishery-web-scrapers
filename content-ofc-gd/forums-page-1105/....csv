144667,Mike the Pike,2007-12-22 23:14:00,3421,  Well look at that the man from the land of Cotton is wearing alot of cotton right up to his neck.  65 degrees I would be in a T-Shirt dog but not in shorts like Shawn.This is coming from Shawn who can't wear a surivival suit cause he sweats too much.shawn are you sure you're not part Husky or something   Thanks for another fine report Glen and how do you keep that sweater so clean.Like Wayne says the camera man needs some help  MTP
