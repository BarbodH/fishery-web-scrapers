Nice pike from early May at Toronto Islands.   This beauty little 13 inch brookie from upper Credit R. in early summer.   Nice muskie from Pigeon Lake in early October.   Despite not getting out much it was a decent year. A thanks to the OFNCers who got out with me this year as well.  Feel free to add pics of your good fish of the year!  cheers,  ehg"

144382,Paulus,2007-12-21 16:29:00,522,"This post is a great idea  I want to add my 2cents, too.  First, 5 fishermen/hockey team in the making. 2 years ago, my parents were just parents. Now, they are on cloud nine as grand-parents of 5 rambunctious little destruction machines  Christmas is going to be a blasty-blast!  We actually managed to clean them all up simultaneously, last June (the one in the middle and the second from the right are my twins. Fraternal of course, as they don't even remotely look alike!) :     Miscellaneous Steelhead fishing pics:  Michigan is in a universe all its own. Some scenery and some jewelry:      Opener in Ontario: a large drop back hen & bonus brown      My favourite pic from the fall, showing Solopaddler putting the boots to an impressive specimen that was immediately released.      Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year to all!  p.-"
