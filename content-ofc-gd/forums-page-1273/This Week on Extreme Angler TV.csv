Bobby-D and Scotty start things up on Lake Erie, trolling with planer boards and worm harnesses in search of late spring walleye - the action is fast a furious with many double and triple headers; then Scott lays a beating on oversized largemouth bass hiding in shallow cane beds; and to top it off, K-Dawg is at it once again, armed with his favorite huntin` stick and bait of pigs he finds some fat greens amongst shallow backbay logs in a game of hide and seek. Guess who wins? The hooksets never stop from beginning to end!  http://www.extremeanglertv.com"
