32018,Castmaster,2007-02-07 17:43:00,86,A guy here on Lake St. Clair died the other day. He hit a stump out on the lake with his sled and his friends found him. Shame cause he'd been complaing about the stump for a long time. It was coverd in snow and what are the chances of him hitting it. Tragic.

The fire trucks couldn't drive on the ice, so they had to go to a landing somewhere...load their gear on smaller vehicles and then drive out there."
