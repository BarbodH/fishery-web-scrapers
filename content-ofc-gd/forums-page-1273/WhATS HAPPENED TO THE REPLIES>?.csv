32011,nautifish,2007-02-07 17:05:00,1416,IS THE SITE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN UPGRADE?   When i click on posts all the replies are in one box and underlined inividually.   You have to click on them to open them to read the full text.  Is anyone else having this same problem?
32012,~CK~,2007-02-07 17:28:00,30,"Nauti.. I figured out what you did.. I think.. go to the top right hand corner of the original post and you can see there is a drop down menu called ""options"". Click on ""switch to standard"" and it should go back to normal.  I hope I'm right anyway. Let me know."
