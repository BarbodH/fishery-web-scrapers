32368,pikehunter,2007-02-08 14:19:00,1659,I hope your house remains dry!  We seem to have far too many of these occurances in the Hammer!

32437,aplumma,2007-02-08 19:06:00,6896,The city looks at the ownership of pipes alittle differently down here. The county/city provides you with a hook up at the edge of your property and the homeowner owns from the meter across the property and thruout the house. This also applies to the sewer lines so if it is broken after the meter its your dime. Good luck with the water issue Gerritt.  Art
32446,Eddyk,2007-02-08 19:23:00,195,Gerrit. I spent 30 years repairing broken water mains with the City of Toronto. If you have any water damage in your basement take lots of pictures. The courts always rule in favor of the home owner.
