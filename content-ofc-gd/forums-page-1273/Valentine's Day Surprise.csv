32228,ccmtcanada,2007-02-08 01:57:00,7971,"I feel sorry for all those guys out there who have to endure a nice romantic dinner....a chick flick...flowers....chocolates etc....  We were out shopping the on the weekend and she says ""So...what are we doing on Valentine's Day?"".  I have my stunned look....""Is that coming up soon?  Ohh...and why is it that the GUY has to plan it?""  She said ""Cause the women plan everything else the rest of the year"".  So my mind started churning....you know....dinner, chick flick, flowers....LOL.  Turns out her original question was all a set up.  Sooooo.....she had already planned our Valentine's day.  Get this.....She booked us for a heated ice hut on Lake Scugog this Saturday evening.  We can fish til around 11pm...or stay all night!  Babysitting has already been arranged....all we have to do is drive up there!  She was trying to surprise me with it, but I found a bag of stuff in the house....you know...the regular valentines day stuff....ice fishing rods, tip ups, swedish pimples etc....LOL.  So...I am a very lucky guy to have a wife who not only plans Valentine's day...but chooses a fishing adventure to boot!  Cliff  PS....this will be my first time ever ice fishing too....cool huh?  Stay tuned for the report on Sunday...hopefully we can catch some eyes thru the ice."
32235,Roy,2007-02-08 02:06:00,13728,We want PICS! And yes you are very fortunate. But Bly is fortunate also or Valentines Day would have never happened for you both. Have a great one.
32241,Spiel,2007-02-08 02:18:00,9065,"....Wow, you done well. Hope you both have a great evening."
32242,GbayGiant,2007-02-08 02:19:00,1780,"Wow, better than the usual valentines eh, she must enjoy fishing more than you. You can still have the romantic diner in the hut to, get the outfitter to set some candles and chocolates, flowers in there for you and cook the fresh fish you catch and presto magic is in the air."
32244,Joey,2007-02-08 02:23:00,9122,"Wow, that's great you two.  You'll have a wonderful time.  Mind if we stop by?  Enjoy.  Joey"
32254,ccmtcanada,2007-02-08 02:35:00,7971, Wait a minute...at first I thought this was a good comment...but then I thought...maybe she does like fishing more than she likes me....LOL
32256,ccmtcanada,2007-02-08 02:36:00,7971," Sure...he said there are 2 holes in the hut and a few outside...you are more than welcome to the ones outside.  Seriously though...if you do want to stop by, we think that would be cool!  Let us know ok?"
32269,douG,2007-02-08 03:06:00,2693,"That was funny right there, joey.  God Bless."
32275,Blake,2007-02-08 03:30:00,418,Very lucky.  She's a keeper
32276,Carp,2007-02-08 03:30:00,1488,"My wife asked today what we're doing for Valentines Day. Instead of my usual smart bass comments, I said I'd stay home and babysit the kids so she could go out with her boyfriend. She wasn't impressed with my attempted humor. My 5 year old daughter says, ""But daaaaaaad, you're her boyfriend silly.""  Sounds like you're getting the perfect gift CCMT. Enjoy the day/night."
32283,tschirk,2007-02-08 04:17:00,261,"Things that make you go hmmmmmmmmm.....  is there a name for the ice hut version of the ""mile high club""?    T:-)"
32285,GbayGiant,2007-02-08 04:31:00,1780," LOL, I ment she must like fishing more than you like fishing."
32292,Castmaster,2007-02-08 05:55:00,86,Does she have any sisters?
32330,brickNblock,2007-02-08 12:42:00,598,"Enjoy your V-day gift......most likely you earned it by the many things that couples do for each other over the years of their relationship. Only thing I would add to that would be some sort of surprise awaiting my bride when we arrive at the hut......... Lemmeseeeee........ An aquavu maybe for the fishergirl in your life? Or, a real memorable romantic setting..........watch the amount of candles, you dont want to keep opening the door for oxygen. I HOPE YOU GUYS HIT TONS OF FISH...........and that the operator will move you if your not on the bite.   (Should ask the operator this beforehand) I never rent a hut unless my wife is comming and Ive always brought my cell to stay in touch with the operator if theres no bite...............Then again, it is valentines night for you lucky folk so will it truly matter!!!!!!!!!"
32334,b2kptbo,2007-02-08 12:49:00,1505,"Nice, have fun..."

32366,Fishandchips,2007-02-08 14:16:00,72,"Just when things start to get romantic,your tip up will go off, then you have to decide ,big fish or wife lol, enjoy your day ,sounds like you have the perfect partner, good luck and good fishing,Brian"
