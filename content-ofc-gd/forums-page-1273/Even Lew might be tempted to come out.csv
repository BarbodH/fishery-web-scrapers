32303,motv8tr,2007-02-08 10:18:00,2587,"Aww come on Lew, you don't even have to go on the ice this time, you can just come and hang out with Big Cliff, Beans and a couple of others at the BBQ  Maureen"
32312,aplumma,2007-02-08 11:42:00,6896,Wow that one nice group of prizes that Petemania.com donated. I am glad they decided to help the Tyler Fund Raiser I am sure that they have been slammed with other people asking for promotional items and I am happy they saw this for what it is A really good cause to help out a family in need.  Thanks again Jen and Pete and all of the staff  Art
32314,lew,2007-02-08 11:53:00,12767," Thanks for the invite MO, but I'm so far removed from ice fishing now, I even sold off all my gear a couple weeks back, so now it's official"
32444,JFR,2007-02-08 19:19:00,498,"Lew,  I can't blame you for selling off your gear, I don't like ice fishing either, I'll be hanging around terra firma making a pest of myself at the BBQ.  Drive up for a couple of hours of chatting and socializing.  John"
32539,Motorhead,2007-02-09 01:30:00,163,"Hi Maureen...  Sounds like some great prizes..  I had a great time last year, met lots of people, ate some food and caught a few perch for an awesome snack. I wish I could make it this to this years G2G but I have a union meeting and it`s election time so I need to go  On a separate  ""Lew"" note.... I think I might have been at Lew`s last ice fishing trip??? I saw Lew icefishing a couple of years ago at an OFC G2G... I brought a friend and we built a windbreak similar to what Clampet is using... I cant remember who organized the G2G but it was cold as heck and I don`t remember anyone catching anything noteworthy. We had a fun time anyway and met a few OFC`rs.. I know someone remembers this G2G??? When was that??? Lew ???   Doug"
32611,lew,2007-02-09 08:49:00,12767," Doug, the last organized OFC g2g on the ice that I was at was about 3 years ago.  Here's a picture of the group, is this the one your thinking of ??  "
32623,Motorhead,2007-02-09 11:12:00,163,That`s the one....  thank Lew
