31705,Clampet,2007-02-06 23:44:00,1947,"As promised, I am posting my results of my super lightweight wind shelter as an alternative to  expensive portable Ice huts.  I discovered through this initial test that I need to make some slight modifications.  My first problem was the ice thickness. It was only 5 inches.  I was counting on 9-11 inches.  This makes for poor support of the poles.  My second problem was the hole diameter of 6 inches made with my auger. I thought that by tamping the poles tight with snow and slush, they would be snug. Didn't happen. This caused the poles to lean at a sharp angle.  Solution is to purchase a drill with a diameter slightly larger than the poles.  This should ensure a tighter, hence snugger fit, hopefully reducing the forward cant of the tarp.    THE GOOD NEWS  My wind shelter held up in brisk winds. It did not morph into a kite. I was not observed running down the Lake yelling, ""Stop, stop, come back, puff, puff ,... groan""!  As evidenced by the thermometer, I was enjoying +20C. Plus 20C, in the sun, out of the wind.  Isn't that something! Out of the sun, the temp was -11 C. But no wind chill...Hooray!  I also caught 35 Perch, all much larger than my last outing. I will be investing in an electric knife to keep Jethro at bay and make the job of filleting those Perch a little easier. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here are the pics:  The arrival. This is the scene that greeted me prior to getting on the lake:   The leaning tower of, well you know...    And from a different angle Notice the water on the ice, due to the weight of the snow...   The Thermometer is looking good!   The purpose of all this-->  "
31706,fishergirl72,2007-02-06 23:46:00,455,Hey whatever works! And nice pics!
31715,Joey,2007-02-07 00:20:00,9122,"Well, a few more modifications and you'll be good to go Paul.  Thanks for the pics.  Joey"
31717,Castmaster,2007-02-07 00:24:00,86,It's a good thing you didn't take that thermometer out to of the package. It looks broken.
31725,knotaclue,2007-02-07 00:47:00,136,i think he had it in his coat
31729,mattyk,2007-02-07 00:53:00,2110,"Thats colddddd! Nice perch, thanks for sharing."
31731,Greencoachdog,2007-02-07 01:01:00,8163,  That's what I was thinkin'!!!  You done good Clampet! She may not have morphed into a kite... but it looks like she wanted to... real bad!!!  Congratulations on the Perch feast and keeping comfortable in the frozen wasteland!!!
31745,Mike the Pike,2007-02-07 01:42:00,3421,Great catch Paul!Do you think you could put an OFC logo on that tarp.Can we catch Tarpin with those poles?
31780,Bly,2007-02-07 02:39:00,1556,Congrats on the nice perch today AND that you and/or the tarp didn't fly off!  Always nice when you have an idea that actually works  bly
31783,Kerry,2007-02-07 02:54:00,383,"Hey Clampet,if you put that center pole on the inside of the tarp and set it up a bit like a Vee it probably wouldn't catch as much wind.Heck of a lot cheaper than my trap pro that I've only gotten out once in so far. Kerry"
31873,b2kptbo,2007-02-07 12:39:00,1505,"With a little modification it'll be oooh dawgies, nice haul with the perch..."
31954,Pinch,2007-02-07 15:23:00,231,"I built me Clampet inspired wind break yesterday afternoon.  I plan on testing it out in belleville this afternoon, I'll take some pics and let you all know how it worked out!  Dave"
32053,fishnsled,2007-02-07 19:04:00,3520, That's what we did a few years ago and it worked great.  The idea of the paint poles is excellent.  We used dowling which was fine but not very portable.  We also use a hand drill with a large  bit so the poles fit snug but still had a bit of play so you could wiggle them out at the end of the day.
32143,Pinch,2007-02-07 23:43:00,231,"Ok, Im back after a short trip to the BOQ.  Unfortunately only one little perch was caught between three of us!!  I took along my 5 year old son, so the four hours or so on the ice was enough for him.  I brought along my new wind break which was built out of 3 wooden broom handles, a 9 x 12 tarp, 8 cable ties, and a half roll of duct tape.  I used a cordless drill with a 1"" spade bit and drilled three 4 inch or so holes.  The set up worked really well, if i were to change anything on it it would have to be the height.  It was about 2 to 3 inches to short.  Im 6'4 so when I sit on the chair my head is an inch or so over the top and catches the wind.  Other than that it worked great.  To transport it I just roll it up and bungee it onto the sled with everything else.  And here are the pics.....      "
32150,knotaclue,2007-02-07 23:51:00,136,Pinch is your dog a newf ??
32152,cisco,2007-02-07 23:51:00,597,"Pure ingenius! Congrats!! Like Kerry says, have the middle pole on the inside so's the wind pushes the tarp against it rather than away from it. Takes a real outdoorsperson to go forth with a piece of tarp and a vision...... which you did, and you SURVIVED!!!! Keep the ideas a comin'!"
32171,Pinch,2007-02-08 00:21:00,231," Thats actually a friend of mines dog, but yes he is a Newf."
32203,knotaclue,2007-02-08 01:17:00,136,"Your friend is lucky, they are a beautiful animal, Iâ€™ve had two over the years but my wife said no way to the slobber this time"
