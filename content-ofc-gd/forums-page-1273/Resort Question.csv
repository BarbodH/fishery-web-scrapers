32085,douG,2007-02-07 21:00:00,2693,"I'm dry on this one, boss."
32118,Smokey,2007-02-07 22:28:00,1278,Doesn't ring any bells for me either but there are hundreds of resorts in the area.
32134,solopaddler,2007-02-07 23:16:00,8605,"I seem to recall a Lynx Lake reserve, or preserve somewhere in N.Kawartha's or Haliburton. They managed several small, natural lakes with some pretty big stocked brook trout."
32317,Jer,2007-02-08 12:17:00,1426,"I've lived and worked in the area for almost 11 years now, I sell cleaning supplies to the hospitality industry...and I don't have a clue...doesn't ring a bell at all."
32328,b2kptbo,2007-02-08 12:39:00,1505,"Sorry, haven't heard of any with that name..."
32333,1leggedangler,2007-02-08 12:48:00,364,"I'll second Solo's answer. I remember seeing a show with Bob Izumi fishing in that area and Lynx Lake reserve rings a bell. It might have been a fly in only though, not sure.  Cheers, 1leg"
