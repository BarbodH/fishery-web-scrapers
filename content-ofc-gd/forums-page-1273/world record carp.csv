31885,dsn,2007-02-07 13:04:00,1018,Yeah I don't see any slime coming off it.
31888,Zib,2007-02-07 13:10:00,369,"There is video of that carp being caught on Youtube. I watched the video, same guy but different looking fish."
31890,mepps,2007-02-07 13:13:00,1301,I belive the record is 84lbs - photo looks legit to me.

32020,wuchikubo,2007-02-07 17:45:00,1114,"Looks legit to me too, 38 Kg, about 83.6 lbs, I wouldn't want to hold that thing too long in my arms! Sure looks like a back breaker!  3rd pic looks like the guy is having a little fun trying to hold it still!  HF"
32040,urbanangler1990,2007-02-07 18:24:00,933,yup i beleive it is real...
32044,Josh Rogers,2007-02-07 18:40:00,79,You would wonder how a fish like that could swim around. That's one giant carp. Zib could you post the link to the video of the guy catching it?
32048,ccmtcanada,2007-02-07 18:55:00,7971,"Hmmmm.....38 kilograms = 83.8 pounds.<bR><BR>  In an earlier thread this year, this one was caught by Gary Hagues. He broke his own record by catching one weighing in at 87 pounds 2 ounces.  Here is the news story for that one....<BR><BR> http://www.nypost.com/seven/12062006/news/...eirdbuttrue.htm <br><BR> There are other sites who have the story documented, but this is the only ""news"" site that had it.  Mostly the story was on blogs and fishing sites.  <BR><BR> Here is a youtube video showing the weighing of it.<BR><BR> <object width=""320"" height=""240""><param name=""movie"" value="" <BR><BR> At any rate...83.8 pounds is a HUGE fish!

32151,MJL,2007-02-07 23:51:00,2427,Both are world record fish  The one in lickmyarmpit's pics is the World Record Common Carp while the fish in the vid that CCMT posted is the World Record Carp  Both stunning fish.
32154,GbayGiant,2007-02-07 23:56:00,1780,He looks like he's in love in that 3rd picture.
32160,ccmtcanada,2007-02-08 00:06:00,7971, Thanks for the clarification!  All these records get confusing after a while.
32208,fishindevil,2007-02-08 01:21:00,6254,"WOW....those carp are huge,i can just imagine the fight that they put up,and it would seem they would have prob kept growing..."
