30368,Rich Clemens,2007-02-03 14:51:00,3131,"I have picked up a Hydrographic map for the area around Lakair (chart 6038).  As I look over the map, I can't find a 'key' to identify what all the symbols mean.   Wondering if anyone has a link to a website where all these are defined.  Been looking around this morning, but no luck yet.  Symbols such as .... an asterisk A plus sign with dots in it Another one that looks like a music note with a squiggly line over top. Various letters such as M, R, S, Cy Numbers in parentheses  ... such as (2) (Very technical aren't I).   I may photo copy some of these areas around Lakair for June, but I need a little help in understanding what I'm lookin' at.  Thanks in advance for any help."
