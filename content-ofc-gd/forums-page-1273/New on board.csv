As an outsider, I had always admired the candid answers to the posted questions and the information that has been provided.  To that end, I would like to let you guys ( & girls) how we made out on Nipissing.  We went to Sandy Bay last week, had a great time, fishing was ... reasonable, the service, and the cottage we stayed in was great.  We caught perch and walleye ( mostly within the slot size that ended up going back) throughout the day, one pike, and herring and even a mud puppy.  We had a great time, would do it again."
