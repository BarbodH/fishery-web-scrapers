32377,ketchenany,2007-02-08 15:16:00,3229,Last nigh went to open my garage door and it wouldn't go up. Upon close inspection found the main spring snapped in half. Has anyone ever had the same problem and what the costs were to replace it?  We used to have a member who did garage doors is he still around?  Thanks

32383,Gerritt,2007-02-08 15:33:00,6129,The springs are fairly inexpensive... but can be somewhat dangerous to install seeing as how you need to put the spring under tension... defiantly worth it to have a professional install it. I have seen homeowners trying to do it themselves until the spring unwinds under tension.... not pretty seeing a guy thrown off a ladder.   Gerritt.
