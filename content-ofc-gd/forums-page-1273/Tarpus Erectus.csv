32484,Clampet,2007-02-08 21:43:00,1947,"Made my modifications ie: drilled 1.25 inch diameter holes with battery operated cordless power drill to house the collapsible paint roller poles that hold up the tarp.  My last post showed my tarp leaning precariously, threatening to take flight.  I had used my 6"" hand auger to make the holes, thinking that by tamping the hole with snow and slush would hold them at a right angle to the ice, but I discovered that did not work, hence a Leaning Tower of Piza syndrome.  After I got the thing set-up to block the wind...................................... the wind changed direction from West to South by South West, so I had to drill one more hole and pick the entire thing up and adjust it to the new direction.  That worked out ok.  Here are the pics:        I got ten keepers for my trouble...notice the size is improving.. "
32492,ccmtcanada,2007-02-08 22:49:00,7971,Looking great!  The improvement is impressive.  Thanks for sharing on this forum and keeping us updated on your progress.  Great work.
32493,fishergirl72,2007-02-08 23:03:00,455,Way to go Clampet! Like I said before whatever works!   The title of the thread made me VERY curious so I had to pop in to find out what was going on.   LOL LOL
32494,oxcowboy,2007-02-08 23:12:00,544,"much better, the evolution is going well!  The perch look pretty tasty as well."
32506,Terry,2007-02-09 00:01:00,14456,"looks good keeps the wind off and that's more then half the battle... instead of an atom accelerator, why not get a black trap to hold the heat from the sun"
32532,douG,2007-02-09 01:12:00,2693,"I agree.  You also want the reflective side to be on the lee.  Ideally, the tarp breaks the wind from the NW, and the shiny side warms you on the S.  Nice job, Clampet."
32533,Bly,2007-02-09 01:15:00,1556,Well done!  bly

32594,Pinch,2007-02-09 04:52:00,231, Now that looks much better than the prototype!!  Pinch
32607,Cookslav,2007-02-09 07:24:00,1457,"Years ago I saw something similar...  Friends took us out on then Ice round Kirkland lake, way back in the bush, to a little remote lake. While we set up one guy drilled a series of holes while the other guy took off into the bush with a chain saw.  he returned dragging 3 large tree branches...shoved them into the 3 holes drilled in a semi circle... with tie wraps, some rope, and 2 tarps we had a semi cricle shaped hut with a roof to boot in no time. once the heater was up and running we were warm as could be....  Same concept I guess on a larger scale?....keep at it Great plan fer sure."
