32198,T Fisher,2007-02-08 01:10:00,139,"Can any one tell me if I bought the right unit, I was thinking a VEXLAR fl18 but was told that the ice machine was a better unit. Your imput or thoughts please."
32207,Greencoachdog,2007-02-08 01:20:00,8163,"Not sure about ice applications, but I've been looking at them to put one on my boat. Let us know how you like it, the good and the bad. I've seen other members with them and it looks like they do a good job!  Smokey and Terry, how do you like them?"
32219,Corey,2007-02-08 01:42:00,355,The ice machine sounds like a champ. The only concern I would have is the liquid in the display freezing. Other than that I was very tempted to pick one up.
32226,backwoodsmanbob,2007-02-08 01:49:00,2,"the screen is tft or something like that, won't freeze. Tom you have had it almost a week, you should have taken this week to test it and report. Hut going out this weekend on Saturday. will let you know. It will be interesting to compare the finders info and what I see on the camera......Bob"
32251,Corey,2007-02-08 02:32:00,355," TFT is an LCD screen. It will freeze, it's just a matter of what temperature."
32284,tschirk,2007-02-08 04:22:00,261,I have had one for over 2 years and used it at -25c and it is amazing!!! It won't freeze & is as fast as is vexliar.  Absolutley the best ice fishing investment I have ever made. I  originaly bought the x67c then added the ice duscer later ... I should have bought the ice machine pkg up front....
32302,misfish,2007-02-08 10:18:00,29133,I was impressed with the one Terry bought. It even picked up the smallest of jigs.
32309,Terry,2007-02-08 11:24:00,14456,I have only used mine a few times  but I am impressed with it so far
32372,cityfisher,2007-02-08 14:37:00,959,its a great unit and goes on my bros boat in the summer
32434,Uncle Buck,2007-02-08 18:47:00,1000,I've heard that interference is a real pain with those x67s when fishing around with those that have flashers...  i had the same choices... i opted with a marcum lx5...
32456,just2manylures,2007-02-08 20:00:00,144,I talked to the boys from Lowrance at the fishing show last year.  They told me this is a specail screen designed just for cold temps.  It can handle -25 no problem!!  I have a unit that uses the same screen on my smokercraft and it is just awesome  my 2 cents  2many
32502,Rustic-Fisher,2007-02-08 23:25:00,826,"Decent unit,  I had one for awhile and ended up selling it. Its seems to be a little tempermental with interference from other units so keep that in mind when you fish with buddies that use graphs. I liked the color screen though.  Rustic"
32503,Terry,2007-02-08 23:34:00,14456,"they  might,  I hear  some flashers put out a lot of interference but the marcum lx5. for 200 bucks more and not as useful in the summer, I am more then happy with my x67c"
32536,samson,2007-02-09 01:23:00,8,"u made a good choice, versatile flasher by some of the reviews i've read.  i would get one if i had the money"
32578,T Fisher,2007-02-09 03:53:00,139,"Gonna put her to the test tomorrow, I will report then.  TF"
