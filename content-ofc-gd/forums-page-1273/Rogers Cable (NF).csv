32187,ccmtcanada,2007-02-08 00:51:00,7971,"We've been talking about reducing our cable services as well b/c of the cost.  So today, bly chopped a bunch of channels from our digital lineup.  We kept WFN of course though...LOL"
32248,Carp,2007-02-08 02:30:00,1488,I dislike the way Rogers operates and will do anything to avoid adding money to Mr. Roger's pockets.  Best fix is to get a satellite system with the channels you want.
32250,GNODDY,2007-02-08 02:32:00,163,"Rogers are jerks, so I went to Bell Expressvu and havent looked back since, I get my phone, internet, and tv all in one Bill. No worries no problems. I have had them for 2 yrs now and there great"
32253,kemper,2007-02-08 02:35:00,2232,"I hate dealing with rogers, last  time I had to call them I ended up throwing the phone because i hate talking to damn computers!  Maybe i have anger issues..."
32261,verno,2007-02-08 02:49:00,178,"I'm so sick of Rogers.  They have managed to lose my internet and TV so far.  And when the time is right, they will be losing my cell phone service too.  I complained about my cell service on the phone and on the net, I got 2 completely different answers.  When I recently cancelled my TV, and they asked me why I was leaving I told them ""Poor customer service""  After a long pregnant pause she says ""Uhh ok umm sorry bye now"""
32262,danc,2007-02-08 02:53:00,4677,"For the record, I'm not a Rogers fan either. I had their cell phone service for a year and it was terrible. I could hardly make a call right in the middle of town at times. Never again."
32320,Randy,2007-02-08 12:23:00,115,"As a follow up to my earlier posting, Rogers now says that The Score was replaced with a new channel called Digital Mux (what the heck is that?  ).  However, this is a lie too since there are no new channels added to my line up.  Its amazing how a big company like Rogers can continue to lie and cheat and get away with it. REASON, monopoly and an impotent CRTC."

32353,JerseyDog,2007-02-08 13:18:00,190,"I had Rogers cell phones and Rogers Cable. I decided I didn't like them, so I went to Bell. Couple years later, Rogers has better cell phones, Bell's customer service is crap and they added $2 to my cell phone bill, but I can't cancel because I have a contract.  Its a neverending story because the reality is, they are all terrible and will make you crazy after a while."
32382,Rob,2007-02-08 15:30:00,467," That is why i changed my email to [emailÂ protected]  When they switched from @home.com to rogers.com the service they provided for the next six months was brutal. They would offer all kinds of freebies to new customers, but the ones who stuck through all their crap got nothin but the royal finger. So i am happy to tell them my email address when they ask for it!!!  Rob C"
32442,JFR,2007-02-08 19:15:00,498,"I must be the odd ball here.  I just signed up to Rogers home phone and their cell service.  So far I'm really impressed.  I use Star Choice for my satelite service.  Dumped Bell, terrible customer service. When I dumped ExpressVu, I was hounded by a couple of CSR's from Montreal, offering me ""hi Def PVR boxes and install for free"" if I would re-consider.  I haven't heard anything from their land lines, but their cell CSR called and offered to re-write my contract with a lot of additional freebies."
