I have a cottage in midland and have fished midland bay and penetang.  So ideally something close to the cottage or at least an hour drive would be nice.  I dont care what im catching just some diff scenery would be nice.  Im willing to trade location for location as i have a few tips and tricks i can share.  please pm.  thanks!!!!!!!!!!!"
