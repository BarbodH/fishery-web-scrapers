31922,ehg,2007-02-07 14:06:00,2666,"Maybe once you decide on final location you could post directions. Might make trip down work pending.  cheers,  ehg"
31927,duber,2007-02-07 14:20:00,220,If you guys are heading to Desoronto please be carefull of the ice.There is alot of current by the bridge and the ice can be 8 inches in one spot and 3 in another.Good luck to all.I might have to see if I can make it down there Saturday.
31937,ccmtcanada,2007-02-07 14:52:00,7971, We called both those places earlier in the week...they have no huts available for this weekend...and I believe they have waiting lists as well.  Oh well!!
31957,tbayboy,2007-02-07 15:25:00,1497,"I'm going to have to bail on this one unfortunately, parents have a 3 hour layover at the airport mid day and called to see if I wanted to hook up for lunch .   Didn't have the heart to say I'd rather be fishing."
31971,Terry,2007-02-07 15:58:00,14456,wish I could go but already have plans you guys need to give more notice.... but feel free to save some waypoints for me so I have some idea where to start...lol good luck
32140,brickNblock,2007-02-07 23:37:00,598,"I spoke with Ron via telephone just after 6pm tonight.Wed. ....told that Desoronto lost quite a bit of ice due to the snow of late and they lost several inches of ice.  ( the snow blankets the ice..end result is melt/shringage) Ron also told me of a few hot spots he has of his own but that was as far as the whereabouts were discussed........maybe another time Ron. Apparently the mouth of the Trent........On the BOQ 1/2 mile out from the mouth of the Trent River they are slamming them.....many fish but of no great size. Fish were caught on small spoons and chubby darters...........w/minnows as backup.  This location is HWY 401 east...2nd exit just after the roadside macdonalds is ,   HWY 33 south into Trenton and on the east side of the river mouth there is FREE parking w/access to shore. There are no huts available period....... except 50/50 in Picton where it was reported to be poor ice. Ron told me that he is looking at an additional 3man hut tommorrow for purchase..if he likes , he buys and first caller to skevy's has first time slot if available at all.  What ya think Gerritt????? I couldnt reach Sam..but I know he took on that rifle course(teaching of)...on the weekend."
32189,Gerritt,2007-02-08 00:54:00,6129,"Sounds good to me! a couple of us will be bringing up portables.... but there is one that I know is not (Troutologist) I think we should heed Skevys advice and stay off the ice in deseronto in light of this info... I am trying to get one more person to fill my truck... perhaps that will get you the third person to share the hut with? unless Cliff and Bly are interested in take it with you... I dont know... All I know is I will be there!! LOL... we can either meet @ Sams or Skevys for around 7am and take off from there? I just want to get on some safe Ice and put a couple small eyes in my fryer  Heck I'll even take a feed of Perch.. I aint picky! LOL  What do you think? Your the resident there, we are the tourists.... Tell Skevy if he is willing to divulged a spot or two I'll buy an extra scoop of Minnows!! LOL   My thought is go to the guy that is gonna help give you a bit of advice and possibly put you on some fish! Looks like Skevy is that guy... as Sam is busy (understandable) and wont be around anyways...Had he of been he said he would come out and fish with us.. Great guy!    So it looks like we may meet @ Skevys and head out from there... thanks for the heads up brother... you still in?  Gerritt."
32213,graftongal,2007-02-08 01:30:00,145,"Hey Gerritt,  Adam and I will more than likely be in on this as well, we're totally self-sufficient as far as a ride and equipment goes.  Let us know when you get times and locations finalized.  Snady"
32263,Gerritt,2007-02-08 02:53:00,6129,"Snady, pretty much our plan is to meet @ Skevys for 7am ish... then decide where were heading after that... seems things are changing daily there... perhaps after talking to him we can come up with a good plan of action... wouldnt hurt to fill up on bait there too and whatever hot baits seem to be working...  Is that cool with you guys?  Gerritt."
32322,graftongal,2007-02-08 12:25:00,145,Sounds good!  Anytime we've gone down there before he's given us lots of good info.
32329,ccmtcanada,2007-02-08 12:40:00,7971," After we couldn't book a hut there, we made alternate plans for ice fishing on Scugog.  Hopefully we can attend another mini get together in the future!  Thanks for organizing this one Gerritt...much appreciated...even if we cant make it.  Cliff"
32355,brickNblock,2007-02-08 13:19:00,598,"OK Gerritt, I'll be comming for sure. I'll meet up with you folk in Beleville for the minnow purchase gathering before we head out. I'm off work most likely the rest of the week due to the weather so today Im going to head down to the BOQ and have a looksee and then over to Skevy's and most likely Cara as well....hopefully I'll run into a few of their ice informers and see what exactly the eye's are biting on. Im hoping to be bringing the family out with me.....I dunno, w/out a hut the wife will be if'y, My stepdaughter, (Lil'Brick) will be a foresure anyway. Peter"
30072,Gerritt,2007-02-02 17:50:00,6129,"I am wanting to hit Quinte next weekend (I am thinking Saturday), I have room for 3 guys and Gear (just dont bring your entire apartment) in my truck and am willing to do the driving... Just share the expenses (Gas, Bait etc...)  Anyone else that is interested should also join us?? we chould get a mini OFC Gathering together and see if we can put some eyes on the ice..  Anyone interested? Anyone local to Hamilton/Burlington need a ride? and willing to share expenses?  I would like to leave my front door early around 3-4am to be there for first light and leave the ice around 5pm   Well let me know if there is any interest!  Gerritt."
30084,Uncle Buck,2007-02-02 18:08:00,1000,"i'd be interested... not sure of my work schedule though... but if its clear, i'd be game!!"
30089,Smokey,2007-02-02 18:12:00,1278,I'll have to check with the wife and see what's going on for the weekend but if free i'll be there.  Mike
30104,huntervasili,2007-02-02 18:38:00,1604,Interest here man... I will have to check the schedule and i will Pm you...
30111,Gerritt,2007-02-02 18:49:00,6129,Sweet! Looks like this just may work out!  Gerritt.
30153,troutologist,2007-02-02 21:06:00,951,"Im also interested if theres room, Im off that day too."
30155,Gerritt,2007-02-02 21:17:00,6129,"troutologist, are you in the hamilton area? if so cool! drop me a pm, hopefully we can get quite a few together for next weekend.. and make a good go at'r   Gerritt."
30179,tbayboy,2007-02-02 22:33:00,1497,"I'd love to give it a try (never been to quinte before, summer or winter).  I'm in Thornhill but can meet up somewhere depending on the ride situations.  3-4am means in Hamilton means I can sleep an extra hour right?"
30186,Gerritt,2007-02-02 22:43:00,6129,My hope is that we can get 2-3 people that can drive or as many as required to get people there and carpool to help save on expenses involved....   Perhaps one of the Guys out east (Toronto area) will be interested as well and will take a few with him (or Her)  as of right now it looks like I have one person in my truck... If not enough people are interested from this area (easier for me) then by all means we will work something out   Or Perhaps you could offer to be a driver yourself to help out others in your area?  Gerritt
30193,tbayboy,2007-02-02 23:01:00,1497,I can offer to drive from the Thornhill area but I only have a 2 seater (potentially 3 if the 3rd is kinda short and doesn't mind be squished into the back).  Just let me know
30200,douG,2007-02-02 23:17:00,2693,"Please remember that 401 Eastbound is still closed near Grafton because they have to replace the highway there.  Current delays due to the detour are 3 hours.  Westbound, on the way home, is clear, except for the necessary rubbernecking in the same area, mebbee 1 hour additional travel.  Tight lines and good luck to Gerritt et al."
30204,Gerritt,2007-02-02 23:20:00,6129,I hope they have it cleared up by Next Saturday douG  sorry I should have posted the date...Saturday Feb 10th   Gerritt.

30425,douG,2007-02-03 19:06:00,2693,"Bly,  you can get the information you need at the Quinte board, @ http://www.quintefishing.com/."
30428,Carp,2007-02-03 19:09:00,1488,"I'm definitely interested, but won't know about my availability until late in the week. Hope I can get out there too."
30484,Bly,2007-02-03 21:22:00,1556,"  Thanks Doug!  Spoke with 3 places in the area and nada....no huts for the 10th.  Ah well, maybe next time.  Hope that everyone has a great time!!  bly"
31774,Gerritt,2007-02-07 02:21:00,6129,Bumping this up!.... Looks like we will be heading out of Deseronto.. So far I have Corey and Troutologist coming... anyone else driving up??  Gerritt.
31782,brickNblock,2007-02-07 02:51:00,598,"Hey Gerritt, If it's less then -10c - I'll be working.....if not, I'd love to join in with you folk. Let me know where you'd be leaving out of Desoronto and approx. time. I live in Quinte West so I dont imagine Ill be picking anyone up, however if anyone from the Stirling or Trenton areas want to hook up as well I'm game.  For Huts......Give Sam a call at   .....'Cara Outdoors' or......................Ron at.................'Skevy's'         both in Belleville, if anyone knows about huts availability it would be them. Im considering putting together Clampetts 'Not a Kite' thingamabob!!!!!!! This sounds like its going to be a blast folks."
31786,Gerritt,2007-02-07 03:00:00,6129,"brickNblock,   Will do brother Corey is taking us to hit ""never fail"" spot  ... I'll let him explain where it is as I have no idea LOL  I hope to be leaving Hamilton around 4am, the guys coming with me are going to be here around 3:30.... should get us there for around 6:30-7 I imagine depending on coffee stops etc.. if you can make it that would be awesome! The more the merrier!   Gerritt."
31790,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-07 03:08:00,1351,"oohhh man, im tempted to join, but most likely  i would need to bum a ride in toronto though."
31793,Gerritt,2007-02-07 03:13:00,6129,Kevin talk to TBayBoy! he is from Thornhill? Perhaps you guys can set something up.   Gerritt.
31795,Mike the Pike,2007-02-07 03:14:00,3421,I think Kevin at Merland Park rents ice huts .I have ice  fished Deseronto before near the opening of the Napanee River no success.I think there is more fish up around Picton.Best to talk with the local bait shops.Good luck to all on your trip to the BOQ and please be safe.  Mike
31866,brickNblock,2007-02-07 12:07:00,598,Mike the Pike.........believe Gerrit said his brother has a NO FAIL spot out of Desoronto Gerritt I'll call both the outfitters that I do know this evening and see what they think about where is producing well at this time.   Desoronto.......Ive only fished there myself in the spring.....but if Corey knows a place...Im cool with that. I do know that in Trenton at the mouth of the BOQ....there were a good 30 huts there this past weekend only about   1/2 mile off shore. I'll see if I have time to get a pic of the huts after work today....... I ll get back later tonight with the outfitters news.
31870,Gerritt,2007-02-07 12:20:00,6129,"Man that would be awesome!!! I talked to Sam via PM and he would need to take us out to a few different spots, but he is unavailable because he is do his PAL instructors course... I sent a PM to Skevy as well waiting on a reply from him...   Thanks for your help brother!  Gerritt."
