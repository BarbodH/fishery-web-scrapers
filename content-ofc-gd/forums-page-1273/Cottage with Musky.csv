32030,Fishn Technishn,2007-02-07 18:06:00,198,"Need some help. Trying to plan a week(AUG 11-18) with the family. Want to rent a cottage, private or a resort. Need room for 7 adults.  Have own boat etc. Good Musky lake preferrably Kawarthas or Haliburtons. The women have only 2 criteria-1/ swimming 2/ nice spot to sit & read/sunbathe. Not a party bunch, 4 guys will fish & 3 women will fish a bit but hang out on the dock etc most of the time. Can anyone point me in the right direction with a name/number/site etc. Had one lined up on Kasshabog that I was very keen on but it fell through.  Any help is very much appreciated.  Thank you   FT"
32033,Castmaster,2007-02-07 18:09:00,86,I've been wanting to go here for a long time. Had some friends go and loved it! http://www.frenchriverlodge.com/

32045,mattyk,2007-02-07 18:41:00,2110,You might want to check out places on Lake Nippising or Georgian Bay.
32047,Castmaster,2007-02-07 18:48:00,86,My buddy got this on Georgian bay near the French River Delta. Would've probably been the record fish but it was caught out of season and quickly realeased. 
32050,ccmtcanada,2007-02-07 18:57:00,7971,I didn't just see an OOS fish on here....  My eyes are closed.....haha  That would have been a real huge beauty fish!!! If I actually looked....LOL
32051,tipupesox,2007-02-07 18:58:00,167,"You may want to try Gil mar Lodge on Sturgeon Lake (Kawartha's), ask for Ron.  I try to get there twice a year, once with the family and the other with the guys in hte Fall.  They have an inground pool and a nice lodge as well as beautiful grounds to sit and watch nature.  It is truely a family oriented environment."
32109,Fishn Technishn,2007-02-07 22:04:00,198,Thank you VERY MUCH. I will certainly check out Pigeon & Sturgeon as I have never fish either. Been limiting myself to Stoney for 17 years!! Thanks also for the tips re Georgian Bay & French River but want to stay a little further south. Prefer the Kawarthas & Haliburtons-strong suggestions from the kids!  FT
