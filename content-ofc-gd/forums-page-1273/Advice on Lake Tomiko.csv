I know there are mainly walleye there with the very odd pike, but are there any panfish, etc around, is the fishing decent, is it a deep lake and do the walleyes have much size or should I be sticking to the same minnows I use for perch.  None of this will affect whether or not I go because we are going for the fun of it anyways, but I am the only real fisherman in the group and would like to know how to outfit my party in order to get them onto at least limited success.  Thnx in advance,  Smed"
32074,Squid,2007-02-07 20:00:00,1656,Stop off at the tomiko / TILDEN rest area restaurant and have a chat with the owner. HE will let you know how the fishing is and maybe will have some minnows to sell also.

Was a great time, but the fishing was tough to put it kindly.  8 of us for the weekend were skunked on Tomiko, not even a hit.  Better chance of a little action if you fish the other small lake attached to it, forget the name.  Pike are more predominant in there, and at least the perch are a little more cooperative if you can find them.  Good luck!"

32520,Smed,2007-02-09 00:29:00,20,"Me and my friends are only avaliable that weekend and thats the only place with any open spots for that week and I know because I called around everywhere for about a week, haha.  Smed"
32521,Handlebarz,2007-02-09 00:33:00,3790,I will be heading there on May 24 weekend I hope I bring back better reports then what I am hearing I have never been there before.
32525,ShaunB,2007-02-09 00:51:00,73,"I have been there for the opener.  Sometimes it is good.  If you fish the mud flats off the river mouth (river is a sanctuary) you can do fairly well for the small spawned out males.  I actually got a 31"" Walleye there four years ago on my first trip there...it was released to swim again.  There is also a back lake you can get them to take you into that is teaming with pike.  Good luck.  So the river mouth of tomiko river might be a good place to try around in the winter it is a fairly slow river so you shouldn't have to worry to much about the ice"
