31727,Eddyk,2007-02-07 00:50:00,195,As Ive said earlier Im hopefully moving to the Rideau Lakes in March. I was up there today and checked about 10 lakes that are within minutes from my house. To my great surprise every one has a good ramp which is free. Most of them also have concrete docks . They also post signs asking fishermen not to fish near the Bass spauning grounds in May and early June and to practice catch and release. Another nice touch is most ramps I checked have picnic tables and parks.  Now all I have to do is sell my house. LOL

31887,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-07 13:10:00,0,Good luck Eddy.   Is your brother helping with lake selection    ?  Jim
31891,Eddyk,2007-02-07 13:14:00,195,No Mistyriver. Unless the lake is full of 50inch Muskies Lew is pretty well lost.
32553,boatman,2007-02-09 02:37:00,350,Good luck. I hope you enjoy the area. I grew up just south of there and I never encountered a pay launch until I moved away. You are truly moving to fish heaven.
