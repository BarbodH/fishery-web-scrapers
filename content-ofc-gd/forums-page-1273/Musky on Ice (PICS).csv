32087,Basskicker,2007-02-07 21:10:00,421,"Well I finally got out for my first trip of the season to a lake northeast of Peterborough.  It was -32C with the windchill.  I caught a couple of small perch but my buddy caught a nice walleye and a decent musky which really did a number on his bare hands. The musky was released very quickly due to the extreme cold, but I managed to get a couple of pics.  I have video footage on my new camera but I can't figure out how to post it....when I figure it out I'll post it!       Jason"

32338,ccmtcanada,2007-02-08 12:56:00,7971,"Great pics and report!  I'm trying ice fishing for the first time this weekend...after seeing the success of many on this board, I cant wait to go!"
32346,brickNblock,2007-02-08 13:03:00,598,Im curious as to what kind of fight the 'ski put up...or was it a mite docile? Did you hand line 'er.... Awesome find through the ice....a successful day 2Bsure.
32356,b2kptbo,2007-02-08 13:24:00,1505,"Good report and pic's, thanks..."
32364,steverowbotham,2007-02-08 14:06:00,1800,i dont know that lipping a walleye is the best idea.
32365,cityfisher,2007-02-08 14:13:00,959,nice eye and muskie !! must have beeen a great day on the ice
32367,PatB,2007-02-08 14:17:00,104,"Nice fish, thanks for posting. Heading up that way tomorrow, hope I have the same results."
32370,drufis,2007-02-08 14:31:00,45,"Great looking fish, thanks for sharing."
32386,Basskicker,2007-02-08 15:36:00,421,"My buddy caught both fish on a hook and minnow......and yes that musky put up one hell of a fight...over 6 minutes on a hand line according to the video which I'm having a real hard time trying to post.  I think there's something wrong with my computer.  He nearly passed out afterwards in the hut from bare hands exposed to the -32C windchill covered in water and snow.....a hard lesson learned for sure...  Oh by the way....as for lipping the walleye the ""wrong"" way....it went in the fyring pan.  Jason"
32414,kennyman,2007-02-08 17:00:00,737,WOOHOO!!! . What a day! I bet that made the cold worthwhile. Awesome fish! Love the ski .......... can't wait to see the video. Thanks for posting that!
32419,barracuda,2007-02-08 17:27:00,41," Think he means that being conical in nature as walleye teeth are, it might pose some threat of puncturing your skin and marinating your walleye with blood.  Very nice fish though! Lookin forward to seein the vid."
32501,GbayGiant,2007-02-08 23:21:00,1780,"Hahaha, I didn't notice he was lipping the Walleye, It's just funny because most people don't want to be near the sharp teeth and hold them by the gill plate so they don't get bit."
32504,Carp,2007-02-08 23:53:00,1488,Chunky walleye and a little extra action tangling with a ski. Nice shooting.
