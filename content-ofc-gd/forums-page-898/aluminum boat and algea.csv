304865,love2fishhave2work,2009-02-11 04:31:00,212,I am debating on leaving my boat in the water for the summer on simcoe as opposed to towing back and forth.  One concern is the algea stains that I see on the boats.  I have an aluminum in mint condition.  Anyone have experience with what a season on the water will do to the boat and motor?  Is there a way to remove all of the algea or am I better off keeping it on dry land?  Help would be appreciated.

I scrub the sides a few times thru the season with a sponge on a broom.. similar to a kitchen mop. The bottom doesn't get too too bad and a spray of starbrite hull cleaner and a rinse takes care of it pretty good when I bring it home. This is on painted hull.. not bare aluminum mind you. My airplane floats... bare alum.. get etched nice and shiney below the water line. Sometimes I think I should take it in shallow water and sink it so the entire float looks the same.  Now Temagami is pretty clean water... take the boat to Nippissing at Lakair for a week and it gets almost as dirty as a whole summer on Temagami. Not sure how quick Simcoe slims them up.

Keep your engine out of the water though, mine seems to be pitting a little bit on the lower unit. I haven't tried to get it off yet though.  Sinker"

Whenever I pull it outta the water to head to a different lake, I use a spray cleaner called Super Clean from CTC and that does an excellent job.  After 10 years though, it definetely has a bit of a light green stain that seems to be on there permanently."

304955,aplumma,2009-02-11 14:16:00,6896,If you have an aluminum boat that sits in the water that has electric run to the dock/marina you should install EXTRA magnesium/zinc anode to a grounded part of the boat. The pitting and corroding you see on the motor is actually happening all over the boat.   Art
