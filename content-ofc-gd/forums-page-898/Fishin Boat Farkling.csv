I know I don't need it all right now even though that be my preference, I will try and be strong not to over strain my plastic to make it happen. I made the list up on the Pro Bass web site and my first thought was to pick away at it using them as my main supplier. However I was wondering who some of you guys use to equip your fishin rigs? How worth while is it to try and make fishing and boat shows to buy seats, trolling motors, fish finders, etc?"
