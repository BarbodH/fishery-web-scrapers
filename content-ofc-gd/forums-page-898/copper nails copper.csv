304933,Maverick,2009-02-11 13:37:00,371,She was cruising along pretty good at 165
304935,tinbanger,2009-02-11 13:38:00,1028,especially like the part where they impounded the umarked crusier for 7 days !  TB
304938,pikehunter,2009-02-11 13:45:00,1659,"She must have had a colleague pretty p-ssed at her to pull her over, can you imagine an OPP ticketing another OPP? But second guessing, I imagine she was grabbed by a radar and radar cameras don't discriminate between cars.  So then there is temporarily one less cruiser on the roads."
304946,Flappn,2009-02-11 14:02:00,245,I agree alot of her co-workers must not like her.

305353,Woodsman,2009-02-12 13:32:00,1286,I'm I the only one who has a problem with seizing a Fire Department Emergency/Rescue Response vehicle. I believe outside of North Bay the fire departments are volunteer. They are likely only to have one such vehicle. Charging the driver no problem but to needlessly jeopardize the communities safety is excessive. Imposing the monetary penalty associated with the impounding but leaving the vehicle avalible to serve the public would make far more sense. Let the fire department also deal with the driver for problems caused to the service. Seizing an OPP police cruiser will not generally cause a safety problem as they have extras avalible for use. Sure the public may be upset with the abuses of these police/fire personal but what would the outrage be if a life was lost because the vehicle that could have saved them was in impound?  Rick
305356,lew,2009-02-12 13:41:00,12766,"Absolutely Woodsman, and I was thinking the exact same thing and impounding the rescue unit would be no punishment at all for the driver in question. I think we'll see some changes in the system after that incident as far as removing certain vehicles from service."
