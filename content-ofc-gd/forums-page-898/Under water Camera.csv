302555,nautifish,2009-02-07 00:14:00,1416,Well i am planning on hitting the show in Missa next saterday and am looking at purchaseing an under water Camera.  Now i do not know too much about these units except there Big....lol...  So i would appreciate any suggestions as to what are the best models out there? and if you do own one how do you like it?  Thankyou so much.

302626,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-07 02:08:00,10439,"I have the 5 1/2"" Cabelas Advanced Anglers Camera. It's an excellent black and white camera that uses a Sony CCD with IR lighting. It works extremely well and is very affordable. You can also record by hooking a camcorder up to the output on the back of the monitor. An added bonus is it's on sale now for $97.49. With an average rating of 4.1 from 142 owners I guess I'm not the only satisfied customer.  PS. Don't buy the panning camera. It is not a Sony and is no where near as clear as the fixed versions.  Cabelas Camera"
304961,nautifish,2009-02-11 14:30:00,1416,Thankyou so much.....  I was looking at the fish tv underwater camera yesterday at crappy tire but was told that this is not a good unit......?
305013,muskeybugged,2009-02-11 15:38:00,282,On my fishing show wish list too. any other reviews?
305016,BITEME,2009-02-11 15:41:00,1968,WHY!!!!
305019,nautifish,2009-02-11 15:51:00,1416,WHY!!!!  Why?.....lol
305022,muskeybugged,2009-02-11 15:57:00,282,"""Why"" never heard of that brand before.........BITEME!"
305054,Uncle Buck,2009-02-11 17:46:00,1000,"i've got the 7"" cabelas camera  it's a hassle to set up, it's big and it's heavy... i wouldn't go and spend the $$ again... if you want it for ice fishing put the $$ for a flasher  when set up properly it works great, but it takes a while to set it up the way you want"
305057,nautifish,2009-02-11 17:57:00,1416,ok what is the difference between the camera and a flasher?
305068,Fang,2009-02-11 18:44:00,1330,"Hey Nauti,  I agree with UB. I've had an Aquaview for a few years and after the initial novelty wore off I hardely use mine. Go on You tube and check out all the different posts to get an idea on underwater fish videos and the clarity/quality. The ones posted on the Aquaview site are done under the most ideal conditions.  When I use mine its mainly for shallow water either open water or ice fishing. Most times it's a pain to get out, unravel the cord, try and see something below the boat and then wind it back up.  Overall I wasn't all that impressed with clarity and visibility. Even with the UV light the amount you see is limited. By a good fish finder unless you're trying to keep the kids entertained."

305107,nautifish,2009-02-11 21:34:00,1416,Thanx so much guys.  I have been on you tube a few times actually latley checking out the under water camera's which is actually why i wanted to buy one.....I guess i'm a big kid at heart lol they look like a lot of fun and i love the way you are able to watch the fish under water while your fishing.  I do wish how ever  there was one you could directly plug your digi cam into and record as apose to a cam corder....  I'll have a look around at the show on saterday and see if anything catches my eye.  Thanx so much again everyone.
305121,Terry,2009-02-11 21:57:00,14456,you can use this on aquvu to record does a fair job or you can use this  http://www.aquavu.com/Digital-Video-Recorder/1/   http://www.hardwarecanucks.com/forum/hardw...der-review.html  seems to be doing a real good job
