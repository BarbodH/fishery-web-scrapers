304657,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-10 23:58:00,260,There was a beer area last year
304658,bigugli,2009-02-11 00:00:00,6138,There is always a beer garden at the International Centre's shows
304778,JohnF,2009-02-11 02:00:00,3494, No comment.  JF
304850,maybe,2009-02-11 03:33:00,307,Excellent - I was hoping to meet the only other OFNer nutty enough to pay for GCD's autographed jigs!
305025,JohnF,2009-02-11 16:05:00,3494, We'll see who's nutty when the bids start piling up on E-Bay. OFNers obviously underestimate the Dawg's celebrity. These jigs may well turn into a bass boat.  JF
305048,nautifish,2009-02-11 17:29:00,1416,Under water Camera & of course to see Dave again....I guess i had best where my shirt as not to get into trouble.....  I was going to look at some new reels too but i got an email from my wonderful uncle who has a whole chest full of reels for me as well as other fishing goodies to pick up after the show....
304363,Lunker777,2009-02-10 13:13:00,866,"Morning Everyone,  Just wondering what everyone is planning on gettin this weekend at the show ?  Im going to be looking mainly for some rod/reel combos. Crankin/swimbait ... flippin/pitchin... and a top water.  I want to get some  Booyah spinners & Jigs, swimbaits, soft plastics, some hooks, sinkers, and some other misc. tackle! Also, I think im going to try Jigs MORE this year. Rondeau bay is COVERED in weed beds, and I dont know anyone that I've been fishing with that has braved them and fished them. So that is a plan for this season.   If i see a good deal, ya never know ! Plus i have a gift card to BPS so im going to have to head there aswell !  Hopefully its a great weekend ! It isn't coming fast enough !"
304365,tinbanger,2009-02-10 13:18:00,1028,"IF i get there (Friday or Monday), will try and attend some seminars, maybe pick up some Muskie tackle.  I am looking for another Heavy/ Med. heavy rod and a spinning reel but will most like order those thru my local tackle /bait shop. Pikeie got an awsome deal on his 9 wt St Croix fly rod.  TB"
304370,lew,2009-02-10 13:20:00,12766,I don't really need anything in fish'n tackle or rod/reels but will probably pick up a couple Double Cowgirls with the #10 blades anyhoo.  Be a shame to go to the show and not donate at least $50 to somebodies pocket
304378,e-z-out,2009-02-10 13:30:00,1052,i'll be looking for a new drop shot rod and a new reel for my ice rod. As always i'll end up picking up more gear that will use sooner or later
304383,bigugli,2009-02-10 13:41:00,6138,I simply like the information I can acquire at the show. Learn a new technique or two. Hints for a new body of water. Buy a new lure or 3.
304385,Lunker777,2009-02-10 13:43:00,866,"Yea Im looking forward to some of the seminars at the big tank. Never been to a show like this, so Im pretty excited ! haha hopefully I dont go to crazy and spend all my money as soon as I get there."
304386,Fang,2009-02-10 13:47:00,1330,Time to replace an old Lowrance. Would like a new colour GPS model for the console and take my Ultra Classic and move to the front deck. My old old X55 is pretty much done.
304422,maybe,2009-02-10 15:00:00,307,"1)  Knowledge.  Jeff and I will be at the Master Angler Bass Seminar Saturday morning.  Really looking forward to seeing Big Jim speak again!  2)  Face time with the OFC crew.  We'll be at TJ's Meet Greet & Bleep at Dave Mercer's booth at 1pm.  3)  A 7' spinning rod that feels a lot like a pool cue and has a smooth foam grip....but I've given up hope of ever finding this.  If I see a 7'2 MH Cumara with a reasonable price tag, it's going in the truck.  4)  A GPS receiver puck for my new cell phone.  Bell wants $10/mo ransom to unlock the phone's internal receiver, but Garmin makes a cute little bluetooth puck that'll do both the phone and my laptop for under $150.  Any excuse to swing by RadioWorld!"
304431,diggyj,2009-02-10 15:27:00,548,"New trolling motor, GPS, lures, etc, etc, etc....."
304435,tdotfisherman,2009-02-10 15:39:00,317,"All my money is tied up for the boat I'm going to buy in the spring.. but I will pick myself up a few spools of line, and probably a few jigs and hooks, just to top up the tackle box.."
304436,irishfield,2009-02-10 15:41:00,26272,I decided my cash strapped wallet was better left in my pocket... so I gave away my tickets to the show !
304440,ccmtcanada,2009-02-10 15:48:00,7971,My wish is that I leave there without needing a second mortgage on the house!!!

304503,Dave Mercer,2009-02-10 18:45:00,148,No matter what you do make sure to save money for a brand new Facts of Fishing shirt! lol We will have them at the booth! Look forward to seeing you all there!
304510,Lowe Rider,2009-02-10 19:16:00,79,"Hoping to be able to go and harass my buddy CC while he's working (cough, cough. I think that would be a first. Working that is!) Just kidding Scott. Life's getting busy for some reason. Maybe that was her plan! Keep me busy enough that I can't drive out there and spend money  . Damn she's good."
304573,fishnsled,2009-02-10 21:33:00,3520,I'll be looking at a new GPS.  I was informed yesterday that I won the Spring Fishing and Boat Show Contest on 680news.  This gives me another $200 to play with as well as free tickets to get in.  Better save a couple of bucks for a new Facts of Fishing shirt...
304579,JohnF,2009-02-10 21:43:00,3494, Ya got 'em fer us generously proportioned fellers?  JF

304619,Dave Mercer,2009-02-10 23:02:00,148,Come on John you think I would forget about the big men!
304623,JohnF,2009-02-10 23:06:00,3494, Okey dokey. In that case I might make the trip to the Big Smoke.  JF
304625,Radnine,2009-02-10 23:12:00,1538,"Hey guys, I have never been to this particular show. Are there deals to be had? Will cash get you a break? Is there a beer garden? Jim"
304626,Roy,2009-02-10 23:12:00,13728,Yeah John. Dave only forgets about the little guys. I can't even get into Joey's shirt....I tried!
