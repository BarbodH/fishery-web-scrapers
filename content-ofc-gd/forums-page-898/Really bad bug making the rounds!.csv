305047,capt bruce,2009-02-11 17:25:00,820,"HEAD HUNTER ,one word ""TINFOIL""   ...  Sorry to hear this CLIFF , hope all is well soon"
305051,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-11 17:39:00,260,"Hey Cliff glad to hear you are on the mend.  Quite an ordeal for sure.  Just shows how fast things can get out of hand from symptoms to very ill.  Stay hydrated, keep off your feet and get well soon!  Plenty of this going around out there so take care everyone.  All the best from Jeff & Adrianne.  Help is just a phone call away if you need anything"
305063,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-11 18:09:00,2050,"Glad to hear you're feeling better dude!  It went through my parent's work-place in Sudbury to...  Both my parents got it, starting with my mom almost 2 weeks ago, then my dad and they're just getting back to normal now!"
305067,shane,2009-02-11 18:43:00,652,  I don't think tinfoil will help for this kind of thing.  I was in the grocery store the other day and it seemed like half the people in there (including the staff) were coughing and hacking and sneezing all over the place.  And half of them were picking through those loose buns in the bins looking for fresher ones and putting the others back.  And then sneezing into their hands before handing their money to the cashier.  The handles on the shopping carts are probably bio-hazards.  I feel like I should be wearing a surgical mask and gloves in there.  Anybody know where I can get one of those haz-mat suits that the fire dept. uses.
305070,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-11 18:49:00,2585,glad your feeling better!!!  sounds like you had a doozy  cheers!
305082,Photoz,2009-02-11 19:33:00,792,"Hope you're back up & around pretty quick . . .   if can ya catch this virus through your computer . . .   with my ol' banged up immune system, ya better put a mask on before ya read my message, eh? (Don't worry about rubber gloves . .    we ain't gonna get THAT personal!)"
305084,Jds63,2009-02-11 19:42:00,1365,"Glad to hear all is well now. We had that same bug go through my wife first then 3 days later hits me and then 3 days later my daughter .... my son so far is ok, but we have wiped evrything we touched in the house with disinfectant ... hope it works and he doesn't get it...  my wife said she thinks she got it from someone at work ... may have just touched the same computer and then wipe your eyes or nose and it's too late"
305120,Beans,2009-02-11 21:57:00,3339, He had half of one of my bologna and cheese g'weeches (no condiments) as he had ate all of his...LOL
305232,Loonietoon,2009-02-12 01:47:00,1450,Glad to hear your on the mend Cliff..now listen to Sue (the Boss) or you will be in big trouble
305234,Sinker,2009-02-12 01:51:00,8692,"That bug came thru our house over the christmas holiday. Nasty is an understatment. It hit so fast, my daughter didnt make it.........I was on clean up. Next day of course, I was sick as a dog. I thought I was going to die.......honestly.....it was bad.  Glad to hear your on the mend Cliff......   Sinker"
305237,smokin joe,2009-02-12 01:59:00,226,Glad to hear that you are on the mend Cliff.  That bug has been going around here too.  I had it for a while last year and it took a couple of weeks to get over it completely.  The problem here is the kids are passing it around at school.  My son got it first and then I caught it.  My ex wound up with it a few weeks later.  It's a nasty bug for sure!!
305246,camillj,2009-02-12 02:10:00,1988,"Jeepers Cliff, sorry to hear - sounds like a nasty bug - glad you are back and on the mend."
305299,Bernie,2009-02-12 05:10:00,3190,Glad to hear you are on the mend BC. Nasty stuff!
304909,Big Cliff,2009-02-11 12:13:00,6899,"Monday Beans and I headed out to lake X for a little R&R, couldn't have been a better day, mild, light winds, a few fish and wonderful company. I felt fantastic!  Monday night about 10, it started, and lasted all night; anything and everything that was in my stomach wasn't any longer, I couldn't even keep water down. By Tuesday at noon I could hardly stand up to get to the bathroom, and then came the trotts. By 1:00 Sue had called Health Canada (I am on meds for blood pressure and a few other things and hadn't been able to take them; well, I had tried) they told her to get me into the hospital.  There was no way I could even walk to the car and our driveway was solid ice so Sue called an ambulance. They took one look at me and the driveway and called the fire dept. to help with the extraction. Anyway, fast forward to the hospital.  They didn't waste any time getting me into a room. Started me on IV, getting gravol into the IV (and god knows what else LOL) I was out of it most of the time. It turnes out I was severly dehydrated and running a high feaver. Well, whatever they put in that IV, it worked by 8:00 last night they had me stabilized enough that Sue was able to bring me home, still very shakey, and restricted to clear fluids for the next 24 hours but on the mend.  It turns out that this ""bug"" is making the rounds and it is a really bad one, the flu shot doesn't work for this one and it is particullarly hard on seniors so if you have aging parents or family or friends, check in on them and make sure that if they get this bug, they get help because it is far more agressive than your average run of the mill stomach flu.  Last but not least, a special thanks to the Ambulance crew, fire fighters, hospital staff and my belovid Sue for getting me back on my feet and ready to fish again (well maybe tomorrow LOL)."
304911,Spiel,2009-02-11 12:17:00,9065,....Glad to see you were well looked after Cliff. It's been around my home and it's not been fun for those who were infected.
304912,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-11 12:19:00,2038,"Glad too see everything worked out , but yeah the guys at work are dropping like flies"
304913,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-11 12:24:00,1362,Glad you're feeeling better Cliff....   Paul...wear a mask at work and take plenty of vitamins!!!!...We have a mission   to complete this Monday and I don't want a sick partner!!  .....how big do those pike get again?
304914,carp-starter,2009-02-11 12:28:00,253,"I know what you are saying - I feel rotten right now and I thought it was Saturday morning. I did not get a flu shot.  I have read in one of the newspapers that more people will get the flu this year.  The reason is that the strength of the flu shots this year is lower than it should be.  What can I say - you see ""down sizing"" every where.  carp-starter"
304917,BUSTER,2009-02-11 12:35:00,1336,"HOLY MOLY  , rough week.. glad to hear your back home and feeling better..  i got the flu last year in may,   went to the hospital they said i had the flu, gave me nothing and sent me home....  be well all."
304920,motv8tr,2009-02-11 12:47:00,2587,"Glad to see you're on the, mend Cliff, and ya it's a good thing you have Sue to watch out for you...take care...  Maureen"
304921,Roy,2009-02-11 12:50:00,13728,Sounds like a real bad one Cliff. Glad you're ok now get crackin' on building that ice hut!
304930,Rattletrap2,2009-02-11 13:26:00,1652,"Glad to hear things worked out ok in the end Cliff! That Sue sounds like quite a woman! Now tell me honestly, was she doubled over laughing when the ambulance crew called for back-ups for the ""extraction""?LOL"
304940,Big Cliff,2009-02-11 13:50:00,6899,"Apparently the flu shot doesn't work for this bug. When it does hit, it hits so hard and so fast, there is no warning from feeling fine to sick in a matter of minutes. It is a good thing that I did have Sue here because to be honest by the time I realized I was in trouble I'm not sure I could have called for help.  Rattletrap2; you have to see our driveway 25Â° + slope down hill from the road about 70' long and covered in ice with rain on top of that, just standing up on it would have been a chalange. The fire dept. had to sand it just so they could get enough traction to come down it without falling."
304941,ccmtcanada,2009-02-11 13:54:00,7971,Glad to hear you are feeling a bit better Cliff!  Carole had this happen a few times in the past...the last time much the same as you...including an ambulance ride to the hospital...  Stay rested...any work that needs to be done isn't nearly as important as you getting better.
304944,John,2009-02-11 13:57:00,2956,Glad to hear that you are on the mend Cliff. Be well and give Sue a big hug for taking charge.
304947,highdrifter,2009-02-11 14:04:00,2534,"They put gravol into your IV??!   Is that common practice?  Did they happen to let you know what it was that you had?  Whatever it was, sounds like a doozie.  Glad you're alright.  god speed  HD"
304950,joonmoon,2009-02-11 14:09:00,528,"Hey buddy glad to hear you're on the mend. Taker easy for a while and let Andy bring you the morning paper and your slippers while you relax. This crappy weather will be over soon and the bugs will be killed off or at least moved on. Nice work Sue, takin care of the old man, we all need to be taken care of once and a while. Good thing for good women eh Cliff!"
304954,Headhunter,2009-02-11 14:13:00,5703,"Glad your better CLiff! A few years back, just before a Quinte GTG, I started to come down with some kind of plague! FishnSled suggested to me, Cold FX... well, it worked for me... kept me on my feet and well, much to the joy of my fellow GTG fisher people, the only symptom I had was loosing my voice! (There was one heck of a celebration in our cottage I'll tell ya! Cold FX works well for half the people I have recommended, the other half, no results. It's all herbal and is designed to simply boost your immune system. It won't conflict with your medication. Oh and if your able, Chicken Soup! Glad yer better CLiff! HH"
304978,Beans,2009-02-11 14:42:00,3339,Wow !!!...I had no idea that you wern't feeling well on Monday...I remember you saying you had to salt the driveway when you got home...I offered to share my chicken broth but you declined...may not have helped but wouldn't have hurt...    
304982,TJQ,2009-02-11 14:44:00,7806, LOL.. thanks for the laugh....  I am glad your better....  those bugs can be brutal.
305000,Joey,2009-02-11 15:10:00,9122,"Wow Cliff, thanks for the heads up.  I'll try all the tried and true ways they say not to catch a bug, wash hands alot, don't touch your nose our eyes etc.  Glad you are feeling a bit better.  Joey"

305002,Bly,2009-02-11 15:13:00,1556,"  for you and Sue from all of us girls.  I am happy to hear that you are on the mend.  I can relate to how awful you must have felt, been there a few times and have never been so happy to see an IV needle headed my way.   Ditto what Cliff said....everything else can wait.  Give a shout if you need anything."
305003,irishfield,2009-02-11 15:14:00,26272,What the heck did Beans feed you for lunch???
305026,Bly,2009-02-11 16:07:00,1556,"  Yes, it is common to add an anti nausea medication to the IV fluids in such cases.  Guess on the diagnosis would be gastroenteritis also known as gastric flu, unrelated to Influenza which is what the Flu Shot is meant to protect against."
305029,LeXXington,2009-02-11 16:16:00,1928,WOW- Time to lock the doors and seal the house up that sounded like a nasty one.  glad your on the mends
305031,ecmilley,2009-02-11 16:18:00,2163,"had the same thing cliff wasn't nice, but cold fx advil and drinking an entire case of gatorade got me through"
305034,Headhunter,2009-02-11 16:28:00,5703,"I've taken to painting the front door of the house with goat's blood in an effort to ward off the evil spirits ... heck, it worked in the past, why not now! HH"
