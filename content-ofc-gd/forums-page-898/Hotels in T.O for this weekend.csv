305021,nautifish,2009-02-11 15:53:00,1416,Are you travelling a long distance for the show?
305024,Lunker777,2009-02-11 15:59:00,866,Coming from Chatham-Kent... roughly... 2.5-3 hr drive ?
305028,Hooked,2009-02-11 16:12:00,891,"I stayed at this place a couple years ago, it's a great place and good rates so I highly recommend it.  Think it only took me around 15 minutes to get to the Sportsman Show.  Back then it costs $99/night for 2 queen size beds. www.stayinnsuites.ca"
305030,Grimace,2009-02-11 16:18:00,2020,The show is in the Airport area I wouldn't stay downtown.  http://www.springfishingandboatshow.com/ http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Mississa...6900+Airport+Rd  Here are some area hotels.   All within a stones throw.  http://www.hitorontoairport.ca/toronto-airport-hotels/ http://www.radisson.com/torontoca_airport http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yyzt...ference-centre/ http://www.choicehotels.ca/hotels/hotel?ho...p;promo=gglocal http://www.hoteltorontoairport.com/ http://www.choicehotels.com/ires/en-US/htm...Yi.GceDNgolHg.2 http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yyzo...-airport-hotel/ http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yyzr...oronto-airport/ http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/prope...propertyID=1771 http://www.sandmanhotels.com/   Lots of them there.    There are a pile of them in the area.   All of these ones are on the same street as the show I think.
305036,Lunker777,2009-02-11 16:30:00,866,Well... I think I just solved my problem.... Called my Uncle... he refuses to let us stay in a hotel... So I guess I will save my $100 a night and stay with family ! haha easy choice !
