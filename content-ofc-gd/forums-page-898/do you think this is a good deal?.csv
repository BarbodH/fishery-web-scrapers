304485,BUSTER,2009-02-10 17:57:00,1336,sold me sled(good timming its raining today!!) was thinking of a new outboard motor for the tin can and ran accross this? http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-b...QAdIdZ101057997
304490,irishfield,2009-02-10 18:00:00,26272,Possibly... but why only 60 day warrantee ? Mercs have 3 year transferable from the day it went into service.
304496,jwl,2009-02-10 18:17:00,1056,"yepper, warranty on Mercs is transferrable to the next ""non commercial"" purchaser they just need to send the registry card in again to transfer the warranty into thier name  The marina may even do that for you, at least they will point you in the right direction to do so.  I have the booklet for my Merc right here at my desk with my paperwork for my boat"
304513,wallyboss,2009-02-10 19:30:00,1095,"If it was owned by a commercial customer before then I don't think that the 3 year is transferable. It might be just one season of use but it might be an outfitter so used everyday for 6-7 months by people who didn't own the motor therefore they beat up on it.  I'd be a bit leary but it is a good price, just get it checked out before dropping the cash."
304516,muskeybugged,2009-02-10 19:33:00,282,Did you compare it to this yet?.....  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=27726  Oh just noticed 9.9
304535,BUSTER,2009-02-10 20:14:00,1336, they have a 9.9 also http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-b...QAdIdZ101057670
304539,PERCHER,2009-02-10 20:27:00,787,That is a used camp motor.
304945,pikehunter,2009-02-11 13:59:00,1659,YEP that's exactly what it is. Pt. Colbourne Marine has been selling fish camp motors for years. I considered one but decided to buy new from a different marine dealer. After reading some stories about used camp motors I decided to run like the wind....well at least a light breeze
305080,BUSTER,2009-02-11 19:32:00,1336,"YES it was confirmed to me in an e-mail from them , used camp motor , thus the 60 day waranty, because the former owner was comercial outfit."
305205,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-12 01:04:00,2585,glad someone chimed in port colbourne is always selling used motors that were from camps.  so you never know how they have been treated.  cheers!
