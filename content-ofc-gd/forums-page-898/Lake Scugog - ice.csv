304604,GBW,2009-02-10 22:36:00,8460,"Hi all.  I was thinking I may try for one last time out on the lake so I wanted to check the current ice conditions after the warmer weather today.  I will not be out before the weekend but I wanted to check and see what the ice is like at the North East end of the lake.  With luck, I may run into one of you out there on Sun. or Mon.  Cheers and thanks!  Geoff"
304640,Sinker,2009-02-10 23:40:00,8692,"You need a lot more warm weather and rain to do much damage to the ice on scugog.  It will be wet, but plenty safe. Just watch out for any old holes where the water has been running down, they will be much bigger than normal.  Bring your rubber boots!  Sinker"
304645,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-10 23:45:00,260,Was working near the east shore yesterday so I popped over real fast to have a look...was still froze up but in layers on the surface.  The river looked a lot more open and closer than when I was there a week ago.  Some locals have removed ice huts.  Maybe they know something
304815,ciceri,2009-02-11 02:34:00,535,"they found that missing snowmobiler today to, floating in the open water at the mouth of the river."
304855,GBW,2009-02-11 03:46:00,8460,"I hate to say this but I am glad they did find him.  His wife was not going to get a penny until he was found and we all knew pretty much what had happened so it's best he was found now rather then in the spring.  Thanks for the replies as I will make the call with my wifes uncle later in the week if it's safe by his place, cheers.  Geoff"
304986,Joeytier,2009-02-11 14:48:00,3990,Id have a hard time believing there would be unsafe ice anywhere other than very close to the river mouth.
