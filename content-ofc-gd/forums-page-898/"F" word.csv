305139,walleyejigger,2009-02-11 23:19:00,876,"i've seen a few of those shows, i find them very ineteresting, i saw one where they raised pigs for food, and another where they raised turkeys for food, they were raised in his back yard, by his entire family, young children included, and he made sure the kids knew they were raising them for food,  anyways i thought it was interesting  they also showed the butchering process of the animals after,  the turkeys were very interesting, they stick something like a cattle prod down they're throat and zap them, they die instantly (apparently) i took it as a learning experience, but it could have been a shock to some  i guess what they say is true for some, ""out sight, out of mind"""
305344,pikehunter,2009-02-12 12:57:00,1659,"Thanks for some of the comments guys...Lew, Gerritt.  I was not disturbed by the cleaning. It was like a couple of you said maybe a bonk on the head first then on with the rest of the job. I don't know if the eel is still alive after decapitation or it is just nerve reflexes? Either way I don't think none of us are expert enough to say for sure as I don't see anyone with an MD after their name. It was the eating of the beating heart that was strange. And I said above in a previous reply I can reminisce about being less than 5 years old and witnessing the chicken and goose killing in my own back yard and didn't take offense to that.  BTW, no offense taken from the negative comments, all have their right to opinion, however some comments are a little bit on the offensive side but I can take it, after all I've been married twice so no matter what is said it's no worse than my ex has said before or what I have to endure everyday at home for the past 22 years"
305358,chukkk,2009-02-12 13:44:00,57,Nicely put about the wife and ex Harry ... I feel the pain from personal experience on a daily basis. I don't think anyone was putting you down but more in a manner that they are reading this stuff for information and a  bit of entertainment and we all jump on something like this. I would venture to say that the same guys would offer you help and advice on any subject that came up on here or if they met you at a fishing spot they would be happy to lend you a piece of eqiupment or give some advice. Thats they way fisher  people are.
305394,Billy Bob,2009-02-12 15:56:00,5865,It very well could be that cutting off the head while alive will get the eel to bleed out more so the meat isn't so red. This may be the best way to kill and clean them for eating.
304970,pikehunter,2009-02-11 14:34:00,1659,"Flipped through the channels on the tube last night and came across the show F Word. I have seen it once before and have seen some of chef G. Ramsey's other shows. Other than his controversial nature this show was really barbaric.  It was based on his desire to bring eels back to the popularity they once had on the British menu. OK, so what's the big deal? Now I don't usually criticize how people handle their catch, whether they enjoy shore lunches, catch and release or keep the allowable quota but I have to say I was almost sick to my stomach at how the eels were handled and had to change the channel.  The show showed an interesting scene on catching eels in the Thames River, pretty neat. But then went on to show the how they are cleaned, OK I'm have never known how eels are eaten cleaned or prepared but this guy on the show grabs a live eel, chops it's head off, slices it down the gut and takes the eel in one hand - the knife in the other and rips the the innards out.  OK, bad but not so bad as to switch the channel. Then he goes into a restaurant with some famous Japanese chef in the kitchen. This guy does pretty much the same  but is really barbaric.  He grabs a live eel, chops it head off, runs his knife from the neck to tail ripping it in two, scrapes the guts out while the bodiless head is sitting on the block gasping for life. He then separates the still beating heart from the rest of the eel and offers it up to Ramsey for a treat! He is standing there with the eels beating heart in his hand and was about to eat it and then I hit the remote and killed the show so I really don't know if he ate it or not.  Now I have no clue as to what is acceptable or somewhat normal but this seemed came across to me as really barbaric and inhumane. Am I looking at this the right way or am I being overly sensitive?  I just googled this and got a you tube link, I didn't copy and paste it or watch the whole you tube version but if anyone wants to see it you can find it on the net."
304973,ricoboxing,2009-02-11 14:39:00,398,"you're being way too overly sensitive (especially for a fisherman). from what you described, I don't see anything wrong with how they're preparing those fish. Whats the difference between that or tossing live perch on the ice when harvesting them?  heart beating = fresh meal!!"
304975,Joeytier,2009-02-11 14:40:00,3990,Wouldn't quick decapitation be the most pain-free way to kill the animal?
304976,BillM,2009-02-11 14:40:00,17367,"You wouldn't like the way I clean trout...  Head, guts, done."
304981,Joeytier,2009-02-11 14:44:00,3990,"Yeah, I couldn't help but notice how similar that is to how most people clean fish around here."
304984,Greencoachdog,2009-02-11 14:47:00,8163,A nice big plate of Collard greens will calm you down Harry!
304987,Headhunter,2009-02-11 14:48:00,5703,"If you think that show's ""barbaric""... you definately don't want to watch Tony Bourdain cruise the world for tasty treats! I don't know how else you would prepare a fresh meal like that... barbaric is not a word I would use describe it, but, hey to each their own... that's why the remote has some many buttons on it! I'm pretty sure the Eel wouldn't clean it's self! HH"
304988,cambo,2009-02-11 14:48:00,62,"I don't know if you can really call the eel alive after it's missing it's head and organs,which part is still alive the head or body.Better than letting it sufficate I would say."
304989,Ramble,2009-02-11 14:51:00,713,"Well as far as the humane aspect is concerned a bonk in the head before decapitation would have improved the situation but its not that bad. The heads not on the body, so it wouldnt feel the gutting occur or anything. As far as the rules goverening such behaviour the eel should have been whacked in teh head 1st. But it's not a huge deal.  As far as eating the heart is concerned, cultural difference. Beating is a moot point. Head is off, heart just doesnt know its dead yet. I'm sure you've seen TV shows of Inuit eating fresh killed seal liver, or caribou meat. No different.  -Dave"
304993,pikehunter,2009-02-11 14:57:00,1659,"You all may be right. Just eating the beating heart that got to me. The cleaning OK, not bad after all gutting is not for the squeamish, but the gasping head was well.... And barbaric might be too strong a word for this. I can still remember my father killing chickens by lobbing the head off and seeing the body running around the yard. But the still beating eels heart was what did it and made me post as it was still on my mind this morning.  And yes we have many cultural differences in this world."
304996,Lunker777,2009-02-11 15:01:00,866," I agree....  I didnt get to see the episode last night, I was to busy surfin OFC and tryin to book rooms for this weekend ... but I could hear the wife watchin it !  I only started watchin the show a few weeks back and I think its a GREAT show. Again I didn't see the episode last night so I dont have an opinion on the matter. The fact that they let his swearin on the air is just GREAT hahah it makes the show way better then hells kitchen I think.... He is a bit rude, but he sure does get his point across !"
305006,Mike Pike,2009-02-11 15:22:00,1332,The only thing I think I would find offensive about that show would be that Ramsey guy.
305007,bigugli,2009-02-11 15:24:00,6138,One of the old methods for killing fresh caught eel was to toss them in a sack of rocksalt. I remember watching the old timers do it when I was a kid.
305008,hotrod,2009-02-11 15:26:00,103,"I'm confused, how else are you to dispatch of the eel? is lethal injection more humane? they cut the head off before they started cleaning it.... sounds pretty humane to me."
305017,chukkk,2009-02-11 15:44:00,57,LOL how about taking them to the vet and having them euthanized while they laid  there head on your knee while you sang them a lullaby.  If you had to change the channel over that you better stick to watching Oprah
305018,BITEME,2009-02-11 15:47:00,1968,KILL EM AND GRILL EM!!!
305043,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-11 17:02:00,10439,"Yeah man, too sensitive. Maybe you should think of giving up fishing and maybe try crochet, origami or maybe even interior decorating."
305044,Raf,2009-02-11 17:05:00,3495, yup or a fork/sharp object where the tail meets the body immobilizes them.
305045,lew,2009-02-11 17:16:00,12766," Harry was only expressing a personal feeling about something, so I see no need to try and publicly embarass him for it. He's entitled to an opinion just like anyone else around here."
305046,limeyangler,2009-02-11 17:24:00,5204,"  Exactly what i was thinking.  al ot less cruel i would think than dragging fish around on a stringer, or put in a warm not so aerated livewell for hours, or just leaving the fish to suffocate and freeze on the ice."
305065,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-11 18:37:00,10439,  I was just kiddin' around. Don't get your knickers in a knot!!!!1 GEEEEEEESH
305088,douG,2009-02-11 19:57:00,2693,"I always bonk a fish on it's way to the fry pan as soon as possible.  I was fishing with a buddy once who seemed content to let that pretty laker suffocate in the bucket.  When I suggested he dispatch his catch, he said, 'You want I should give him a Parry Sound Severe?"""
305098,Raf,2009-02-11 20:35:00,3495,sounds familiar doug
305100,EC1,2009-02-11 20:49:00,930,"well, eels continue to move long after they're dead. some muscle thing going on there. But no matter, they're dead.  BUT, you should have told him what your thoughts were on Monday at the Eaton Centre then A buddy of mine told me he was there for a show of some sort"
305138,Gerritt,2009-02-11 23:17:00,6129,  Well said Lew.  G
