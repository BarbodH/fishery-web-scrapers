This link may get you close: http://www.cbc.ca/vinylcafe/shows.php?vShowID=1072   Here is the show's web site where you can find past episodes.  http://www.cbc.ca/vinylcafe/home.php   Again the show date was Jan 10, 2009."

I've subscribed to the Vinyl Cafe Stories podcast for pushing a year and a half now.  It's great - every week, a new ""Dave bumbles, and something terribly funny ensues"" story magically appears on my hard drive.  I load them into our boat's MP3 player, and Jeff & I enjoy listening to them while we're fishing.  BTW, if anybody's got MP3 of The Debaters, I'd really appreciate a pm!"
