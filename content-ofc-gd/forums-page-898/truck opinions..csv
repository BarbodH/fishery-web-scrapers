That is a clean looking truck.  My dad has an 04 duramax that has a 3 stage hypertech computer system. Full 5"" exhaust, Intake and intercooler and I think he may have even put on a bigger turbo.  This thing can move for a big vehicle.  Diesels are great.  Your dad's should not have too many problems.  My dad bought his new and loves it.  He tows a 30' fifth wheel and his boat behind that at the same time.  No probs."

304439,Billy Bob,2009-02-10 15:48:00,5865," Maybe you didn't hear but Toyota is the #1 automaker in the world now passing GM this year. I don't think they did that by building unreliable vehicles but that is exactly why GM is bankrupt and needs the US government to bail them out or they will go under. I don't see that happing by Toyota or any other foriegn car manufacture to my knowledge. I find it amusing that many just don't want to recognize that. If GM, Ford and Chrysler vehicle were so good why are they having trouble selling them. Why are they ready to go under if not helped by taxpayer's dollars.  As I said before purchase what you want. I purchased over 15 new vehicles in my lifetime and have given up on GM, Ford and Chrysler.  This argument will never end but at least it is civil up to now.  Bob"
304444,JohnAB,2009-02-10 16:08:00,178,"BillyBob, many factors are leading to the financial woes of GM. Least of not which is their paying of health benefits etc of all their retired employees. Was a very good article on it in the newspaper the other day.  As for your assertion over Toyota's being so good. Maybe ask my sister about her 2007 Toyota Camry."
304504,doubleheader,2009-02-10 18:48:00,497,"Hi all. I've enjoyed reading these opinions and even got a few chuckles. I myself have a Honda Ridgeline, and while it does what I need it to do I don't consider it a real truck. That's fine by me, like i said it does what I need it to do and in comfort. It pulls my boat, carries my 4 wheeler, gets me to work, camp, and home, and never goes back to the shop. I really could relate to the Silverado horror story, because I have a similiar feeling about Ford. I had a Ford F150, and in 2004 (I think) I qualified for the Cabelas National Team Championship in Dubuque Iowa, a trip of some 1200 miles each way. I'm going to give you the short version of the story, not because I'm trying to hide anything but because the long version would take pages. Anyhow, 3 days before the tournament I had a fuse problem. Dumb me did not bring any tools, but thinking it was no big deal went to the Ford dealership in Dubuque just 2 miles from our hotel. To make a long story even shorter, by the end of the tournament week I had paid the Ford dealer over $500.00 for 2 fuses; actually 4 fuses because they replaced them twice. At the time I was pretty sick about it, but I was focused on the tournament. When I got home the problem occurred again, and that's when I pulled out my invoice copies and looked at what they had actually done. I replaced the 2 fuses for the 3rd time and then determined the root cause, which was my trailer lights were intermittently shorting out and causing the fuses to blow. Anyhow, while it certainly wasn't the dealerships responsibility to fix the trailer, in my opinion they certainly took advantage of me. I wrote Ford and I wrote the dealership and I never got any satisfaction. I sold the truck within 3 months and will never in a million years buy another Ford anything until I receive a fair compensation for being ripped off.  Anyone who believes that it's people like me that are contributing to the economic collapse in the U.S. are sadly misinformed. I've spent my life in manufacturing, I've worked since I was 15, I'm a veteran, and I pay taxes...a lot of taxes. Anyhow, like I said, I've enjoyed reading these posts."
304506,Lowe Rider,2009-02-10 19:04:00,79,"  I think the biggest difference Toyota has over the domestics is service. All car makers produce lemons or cars with more problems than others made that year ( either made on a Friday of a long weekend or the first Monday after Christmas holidays). My mom had a Camary that ate starters and alternators BUT they took it in and fixed it over and over, no arguments and a car to drive to boot.  I've owned three GMC trucks and the Chevy truck I own right now and have been happy with them. They do what I need them to do and come back for more even though I use them hard. The Chevy is the first one that has needed warranty work performed and it has been hell. The Bull GM dealers put you through is incredible but if you were paying for it they bend over backwards to help you and no replacement ride unless they know for a fact it is warranty work. They have put three sets of heads on it and they are going again. I can't wait for the fight with the service manager this time  .  All the brands have their good and bad points but after this experience I might change brands next time just because of the service side of things. Toyota seems to be the best for service according to friends and family but I personally don't like the '07 truck for my own reasons after driving one for a while at work. Not saying it's bad, just not for me. Does that make any sense?  Going to have to start a thread next year on service stories to see who comes out on top. After all the crap I have been through with this, it will come down to the truck as well as the best after sales service next time. I want someone who backs up what they sell. Maybe I'll just bite the bullet and fix this one myself, put a new motor in it and ride it into the ground.  I truly believe after sale service is what has given the Big Three all their bad press in the last 20 years. I just happened to experience it recently and I am considering a brand change. How many others are out there like me. I think they took the North American market for granted and are paying for it now."

305273,Maverick,2009-02-12 03:30:00,371," Since everyone is busy arguing I guess I'll try and answer your question. My grandfather bought an '80 chev custom deluxe k10 brand new off the lot. Still has it to this day. It has the 350 and a standard transmission with a bull low gear. I've never seen a truck that hasn't been modified in any way go through so much and constantly tow heavy loads. He used to use it to skid huge logs out of the bush and now he uses it to haul his cut wood from the bush. He hauls 5600kg loads right on the bumper and has been for 29 years. Probably going on 5-600k, odometer says 4-somethin but it didn't work for much of the 90's. Through that time it has gone through some body jobs, like all older chevs, it rusts, put one motor in it didn't need to but he ""got a good deal on one"" as he says. I think he also put a rear end or 2 in it but with all the heavy jerking and hauling he did and does it's understandable. On a side not, about 5 or 6 years ago he bought a ford f150 just for a daily driving truck, that truck probably has cost him more in the 5 or 6 years on maintenance than his chev did in 29 years.  But that said, they really don't make them like they used to, no matter what vehicle you talk about. Too much plastic on all the vehicles now, even the trucks. I own a 91 chev 2wd (wish it were 4) and it is extremely reliable, does what I need it to do and in the 5 years that I have had it I've only had to put a starter on it. The best thing about it is that it's made of steel, imagine that! The Cheyennes of the mid 90s are tough trucks too... Hope this helps with your choice, when you called them old brutes, you were right."

303725,taper,2009-02-09 10:24:00,611,Beertech the vehicles you have listed have all been great to me for longevity. The Canyon is 3 years old now and the only thing we have done was a evap sensor under warranty. The Silverado I am selling has just over 200k on it and other than brakes I have not had to touch it. No matter what you buy they can all have their problems butin my experience these are pretty solid trucks.
303848,charlesn,2009-02-09 17:48:00,551,"Not sure about the 2005 Silverado, but I have a 2008 Silverado, Crew Cab, Short box, 4.8 V8 (4x4 though) and it is WAY better on fuel economy than my 2005 Trailblazer with 4.3 V6 was.  Even for city driving, at least it feels that way from the number of gas stations stops I need to make.  Towing, it was ridiculous how bad the Trailblazer was with my boat.  The Silverado hardly knows it is there and can make it from my place to the lake and back for most lakes that I fish which was never true before.  But I will be honest, if I didn't have $2000 of GM Visa points saved up, I might have gotten something else as I had a GMC Sierra before the trailblazer that was a terrible lemon, but those GM Visa points keep making me go back to GM.  Smart marketing by them I guess.  Now that I have the truck, I love it.  Charles"

How many Kms were on that truck ? and were they major issues ? because those $$ can add up quickly. And also, was it $18000 worth of parts alone ? or is that labour PLUS PLUS ya know ?  It makes me mad reading posts about how good foreign vehicles are... and then 2 or 3 topics down the board.... its the same people complaining about the economy... or how they lost there job....

303979,kennyman,2009-02-09 22:00:00,737,I'd say a Chevy/GMC V-8 pickup is the best bet. I think they're a great all around truck. IMHO any 5 or 6 cylinder light duty engine isn't great for what you want it for because they just have to work too hard. We have an automotive high performance parts (muscle car) retail shop that's been going for the last 35 years and we've always relied on our Chevy/GMC trucks. Myself I drive a Buick Roadmaster wagon with a 350/700r4 in it. Works great for towing and is the closest thing to being a truck without being one.

304001,aplumma,2009-02-09 22:31:00,6896,  Normally I would let this pass but you are spewing crap about a truck you haven't even looked at. How is it you can say the frame on the Nissan flexes it is a full box frame that is designed to be used on a future 1 ton vehicle but also their future diesel platform. It is a 1/2 ton truck rated to tow 9500 lbs and is very well engineered. The tailgate is easily removed by lifting it off two 1 inch bolt assy. if that's what your referring to it is not a flex issue so much as a convient and easily removed tailgate. The sheet metal on the truck comes from the same plant that the infinity are made at a car noted for superior fit and form on it's sheetmetal. Nissians are not for everyone and I wouldn't dream of suggesting that they are for everyone but to bash something you don't like with lies ain't right. I base this all on fact and I have owned and drive ALL of the big name trucks and for me at this time it is Nissan over domestic trucks.   Art
304010,FUSION,2009-02-09 22:44:00,81," FYI, Nissan has contracted out the Titan to Dodge to build for them as you and the other 50 people who bought one didn't warrent Nissan to keep the assembly line open in its own factory.  For frame flex, nothing is worse than the Tundra. That truck is down right dangerous to be driven with the tow/haul specs toyota lists."

Then to top it off, I had to go for another injector pump, this is now #5, I finally got wise and went to an independant diesel shop, no pump needed, just the PMD to the tune of another $700(little black box about the size of a pack of smokes.) I find out afterwards, GM had extended the warranty on that particular item to 11 years, 192,000km(120k miles) but would not come clean or even go part way. That was the sh#*# dealer in Barrie on Bayfield.  I had to show them where the warranty was extended.  Now you wonder why I will NEVER buy another piece of GM junk.   Oh, not to forget, the truck had just rolled over 159,000 when I traded it in...on a Cummins.  How many times have I been back to this dealer, a bit of routine brake maintenance, otherwise I'd forget where they were located.  If GM croaked it would probably do the automotive business a favour.

This is why I now own a Toyota Tundra. It's almost 2 year old and I forgot were I purchased it because it's never been back to the dealer.  To each it's own when it comes to buying anything. I REALLY tried to stay with a domestic vehicle but the problems were relentless. So know I purchased my first foriegn designed vehicle after 38 years of driving. I say that because it was built here in Indiana. My son also just recently purchased his first foriegn vehicle, also a Toyota when he seen how well built my truck was. He was forced to get something quick because his Pontiac need a new head gasket and fuel pump with only 65,000 miles on it. He did some research and found that was a noted problem with that engine. GM didn't want to do anything for him in this matter so he jumped ship and I doubt he will ever go back.  One thing to consider, if GM, Ford and Chrysler vehicles were so good than they wouldn't be in bankruptcy now. They would have folks beating down the door to purchase they quality vehicles and not going in droves to the foriegn market.  In the end it's your money do what you want with it and hopefully you will be happy with your purchase.  Bob"

Firstly I own a gmc sonoma 4.3 and have loved the truck. I do however find it is thirsty when im towing my boat 16.5 with a fifty.  I kinda think maybe its gearing thats the problem but not sure.  I am looking right now at a few trucks and am basing my decision on gas mileage in general and towing gas mileage. So any opinions on the trucks im considering would be great  2005 chevrolet silverado 4.8 litre v8  2wd  2005 chevrolet colorado  5 cylinder 2wd (wondering if the inline 5 would tow better than what i got.  2006 chevrolet silverado 4.3 v6 2wd   wondering if the gearing is better for towing even though its the same motor I got  ford f150 v6

We run them hard and they are GREAT on gas.... they are a little big of a hog when towing, but any of the choise you posted would be.  I live in chatham Ont and I drove from chatham to london round trip TWICE on under a half tank of gas. My truck has a 115L tank roughly.  With a 16.5ft boat... It would be ""good"" on gas.... I would say... not GREAT  If you could look into the 5.3L V8 from GM .... then you would be set.... by far the best gas milage IMHO when towing or driving, as long as you dont have a heavy foot."

The 5 cylinder is not much of a step up, if  at all. I saw a nice 04 dodge quad cab 2500 5.9 cummins diesel the other day.

EG. a car with 4:10 to 1 gears is going to get down the track quicker than the same car with 3:23 to 1 gears. A screamer at high way speeds though, engine is turning more RPMS to maintain speed, increased fuel usage.  Over drive transmissions were a way to help, allows a lower number rear end to have the same pulling power and increased fuel economy by adding an overdrive gear to the tranny. Allows for a higher number first gear in the tranny to make up for a lower one in the rear end.  Pick up trucks are intended for pulling, hauling, they probably come with a higher gear in the rear end than a car, a towing package might add to that.  Rear end gear ratios used to have some options, a higher gear number will make the ride seem more peppy a lower number better on fuel, not as good towing.  Got a 4.3 in my Astro, first gear is a screamer, kicks into second at like 10mph, designed to get the ride moving at bit faster.  Transmissions like the douG Nash five speed (manual) could be ordered with different gear ratios like a 3.25 to 1 first gear instead of a Muncie 2.20 to 1 first gear to allow quick pickup with a low axle gear, more top end speed better fuel economy."
302746,rhare,2009-02-07 11:20:00,387,"Any reason you are not looking at imports? Ive owned  a few differnet trucks now and the toyota and Nissian's are leagues above the domestic crap that is being produced. way better tranny's and drive systems. save yourself some hassel and by a import, just my 2 cents. "
302763,2 tone z71,2009-02-07 13:50:00,1311,too bad he dident ask about Import Crap he wants a mans truck my 2 cents
302787,beertech,2009-02-07 15:03:00,118,I am not interested in the foreign models due to the poor fuel economy they get and the high price they demand.
302788,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-07 15:06:00,0,take a look at some of the older durango's pre 2004 for the older body style  you can pick up one with 100k on it for 9 grand loaded with leather  they have the 4.7 litre engine (287) with 3.55 rear end with a 5 speed tranny 545rfe  (theses engines and trannies are bullet proof) been in jeeps for a long long time   all the power you will need and quite ggod on gas towing and driving   I can drive from oshawa to elephant lake just north of bancroft pulling a 18 foot bass boat with a 150 hp on it there and back just under a half tank of gas roughly and it is only a 95 litre tank in the durangos with the 4.7 engine  imports are very good but no aftermarket (used) and alot more money new  I drove buy a honda dealership after a snow storm and laughed my ass off they had all these trucks and the dealership snow plow was a dodge ram LOL!!! they even a advertisement on the side of the truck for the dealership  just proves if you want a truck that can do work buy a dodge LOL!!  this would be a great commercial for dodge LOL!!!
302798,tschirk,2009-02-07 15:35:00,261,I'm looking at a new vehicle too. My #1 choice right now is a 2009 Honda Ridgeline VP. There are some good deals out there. I've heard great things about it.
302799,lew,2009-02-07 15:36:00,12766," It's actually pretty funny that you posted that, cause there's a Honda dealership close to me here in Toronto that plows their snow with a Jeep Cherokee and they also have the dealership name on the side of the Jeep.  Chrysler should definetely jump all over this opportunity"
302809,mikeh,2009-02-07 15:55:00,824,"I tow with a 2001 Nissan Pathfinder with a 3.5l engine and find that I use 30% more fuel while towing. I've seen trucks passing me on the highway doing 120kmh and would hate to see there gas bill ,I'm the guy putting along in the slow lane."
302826,hotrod,2009-02-07 16:54:00,103,I'm looking at buying a new truck this year also so these posts always interest me. One thing for sure is I won't be buying foreign. I towed a 21' triton around last summer with a 99' jimmy and after being initially worried it towed fine and did the job no problems. It's getting up there on mileage and I've had it for 10 years so I figure it's time for a new vehicle. Those new fords sure look nice!
302833,Grimace,2009-02-07 17:03:00,2020,"My friend has a Dodge, he loves it.     My dad has always had Fords, he loves them.    Plenty of guys at work have Chevys and GMs and they love them.  I have always had Fords, loved them.   This last truck I bought is a Toyota and I love it too.   Buy the one you think looks the coolest.   lol.   Whatever you get I am sure you will Love it.    Have fun with your new truck, and congrats."
302964,rhare,2009-02-07 22:27:00,387,"   lol to each his own , Ive got a manly looking dodge Ram thats pretty much put together like barbie car.  Now Im driving a Titan and still feelin manly enough"
303104,SBCregal,2009-02-08 02:29:00,688,"good chance anything chrysler is gonna be a bit heavier on fuel than that sonoma with  the 4.3 (GREAT motor btw, we have almost 800k km on our 99 safari)"
303107,taper,2009-02-08 02:34:00,611,"I am just in the process of getting rid of my 2000 Silverado with a 5.3, i am replacing it with an 05 Silverado with a 4.8. If was up to me I would have stayed with the 5.3 for the extra power when towing. The 4.8 is slightly better on fuel when empty but put the trailer on and they are almost the same. As for the Canyon/Colorado my wife has had an 06 since new and although it is a nice truck the 4.8 in the Silverado will be pretty much the same and when towing probably better. If fuel mileage is what your after I would stick to GM out of the big 3. Unless your looking at going brand new, then the new Fords are pretty impressive, but the new GM's are a lot better than the older ones as well."
303112,limeyangler,2009-02-08 02:36:00,5204,my Canyon(Colorado) is the beezneez
303229,moose,2009-02-08 12:40:00,266,"just traded in my f150 2006 for a 2009 150 great truck for driving and towning as well, if you get the ford i have a cap for sale for 800 $ a viewliner  with all the bells and whistles"
303247,mbac31,2009-02-08 13:12:00,904,"I have had a ew Chevy trucks. I like the 5.3L engines the best. I have had the 4.8L and if you are towing or working the engine at all it will burn the same, cause more stress on the engine and keep the revs higher thus burning more gas and causing premature wear on the engine. I have owned 2 of the newer ones. I find the 5.3 to be the best. I put a K&N filter kit with the tube on and it performs very well. I drive up to Elephant lake area all summer long and it burms a little under 1/2 tank while pulling a 18 footer with a 175. Tons of power and engine works less when driven normally and dont forget. The # 1 reason I like it. If you are on the highway  and you need to pass with a boat on it will give you the power you need, the 4.8L will not. The 4.8L will bog no matter what you do. I should mention that mine is a 4x4 as well the tank is a 90L tank as well."
303268,BillM,2009-02-08 14:28:00,17367,I bought a new tow vehicle yesterday.. No more borrowing my dad's Duramax!  
303275,lew,2009-02-08 14:51:00,12766,"Nice lookin ride Bill, congrats !!"
303277,Billy Bob,2009-02-08 15:00:00,5865," I have only read up to this point in the thread but this is REALLY not true. Don't take all those Chevy commercials to heart. You should do a LOT of research from independent sources first, like Consumer Reports, et............. Consumer Reports did actual mileage figures and the Tundra came out on top but it's wasn't much. Something like 1 mpg.  Now for my real mileage, I get 19.3 mpg (US miles/ US gallons) while NOT towing and between 14-15 mpg while towing my boat. I think that is pretty good with a truck that has one of the largest V-8 in a half ton truck. This truck can tow 10,000 lbs and the boat is dragged around like a rag doll behind it. It's Toyota's 6 speed tranny that makes the difference. I did hear Toyota is now working on a 8 speed tranny for even better fuel economy  Good Luck and have fun Truck Hunting, Bob"
303534,beertech,2009-02-09 00:06:00,118,well I have narrowed my decisions down to the ones listed.  Anyone have any idea what kind of kms should be realistic before problems start to arrise in todays trucks.
