You all seem to have a great deal of experience in what I call my favorite pastime (fishing that is). Thanks to everyone for providing such great info, I hope to be able to provide some as well now that I am on this forum more often.  Many of my fishing stories have been up in Algonquin Park, this is where I find my solitude and get in some great fishing. I only have a canoe so gotta keep off the main drag. My buddy and I started ice fishing about 5 yrs ago and have been going up to Temagami ever since … with side trips to Simcoe and Haliburton. We are headed up to Temagami next week for the laker opener and I hope to share my report and pics with y’all. Last year I was lucky enough to get 5 species over 4 days (laker, whitefish, ling, cisco and pickerel)… you just never know whats comin up that hole …LOL cheers"
