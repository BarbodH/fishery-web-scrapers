304655,motv8tr,2009-02-10 23:56:00,2587,"I'll be checking out Innisfil on Friday...  I expect the ice will be fine, but smoooooth  Maureen"
304863,Rizzo,2009-02-11 04:24:00,4754,"maybe I'll finally get to use my cleats! I ice fish kempenfelt once a year...the charity tournament thats coming up this saturday. What a date to choose too...valentines day...like fishing doesn't get you in enough trouble by itself, they have to stick it on valentines day"
304864,irishfield,2009-02-11 04:28:00,26272,I'll be leaving the sled at home me thinks... bare ice and no snow not too kind to track sliders.
304866,fishon64,2009-02-11 04:35:00,15,Good idea to leave the sled at home!!
304867,Skud,2009-02-11 04:41:00,739,I was driving around on the ice at the 8th Line of Innisfil this morning in my truck. Lots of good ice and very slippery. Didn't catch any fish.  It will probably be a perfect skating rink come Saturday.
304871,irishfield,2009-02-11 04:47:00,26272,Thanks Skud... we're probably gonna drive out on Saturday as well and leave the sleds at home.
304874,BassAsin,2009-02-11 04:58:00,806,dig out the skates wayne!
304888,Cudz,2009-02-11 07:35:00,2652,"Went out and drilled hole on Monday evening. Out from the fountain there was about 12"",  THis might seem like a lot but at BBP on sat there was about 18"". There was no snow and very slippery.  Be careful out there."
