304143,trapshooter,2009-02-10 01:29:00,1234,"... you missed a pretty good day.  Simon (limeyangler) was supposed to join us today for a day of walleye fishing on Lac Seul.   However, freezing rain in the forecast kept Simon down in Dryden but Graham and I still hit the lake.  We picked up some for the freezer and a few nice fish that went back down the hole.  Lost a slush scoop and broke a rod too.  Quite a day.  Graham with a couple of nice fish.  24""       Mid day, my set line started to go slowly down and I set the hook into something solid.  My PB Ice walleye 27""      Sorry you couldn't make it today Simon.  We'll have to make it up on the 17th.  The big girls are still down there waiting for you.  Tight lines all,  Ben"
