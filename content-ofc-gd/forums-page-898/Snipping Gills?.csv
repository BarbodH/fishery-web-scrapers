304559,glen,2009-02-10 21:01:00,2641,I snip them.  I like the look of the fillet but i am not sure it tastes any different.
304564,jwl,2009-02-10 21:12:00,1056,lots of guys will bleed the fish if they plan on not keeping them alive until they fillet them up.....some guys just grab 2 fingers under the gills and snap thier heads back until they pop  other guys will take a knife a stick the fish through the heart to bleed it out
304805,web-fisherman,2009-02-11 02:26:00,54,Will give it a try. I had a gent swear by doing this. We will see.  Thanks
304932,Canuck2fan,2009-02-11 13:37:00,1444,I have always bled salmon or trout I am going to keep. After talking with my uncle a few years back about muddy tasting bass he suggested killing them right away if you plan to keep some smallies. I have done it ever since and no more muddy tasting bass either... It kind of makes sense if the fish is stressed on a stringer on in a live well it has to produce some unwanted chemicals which could affect the taste. I wonder if anybody has done any testing in a lab?
