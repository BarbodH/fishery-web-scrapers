305123,GeorgeJ,2009-02-11 22:06:00,207,"I'm looking to buy a couple of pedestal style seats for my boat. These are pretty reasonably priced at Pro Bass, they are http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...5008000_225-8-1 Action Outdoor Copolymer Padded Boat Seats, has anyone got these and if so how are they for comfort, durability? Anybody suggest any others?"
305128,HTHM,2009-02-11 22:35:00,4082,"I have a similar seat on my boat, and I find on hot days, they are not the best for comfort IMHO. The other ones on the same page for $9.95 (Wise Deluxe High-Back Fishing Boat Seats - Model WD588PLS) might be a better seat to look at. Good luck with the purchase."

305340,JFR,2009-02-12 12:49:00,498,"I replaced the standard seats on my legend with this model.  I also have two of the models you are preparing to buy, on my rear casting and front casting platforms. Both are very comfortable seats.   http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...5008000_225-8-1  John"
