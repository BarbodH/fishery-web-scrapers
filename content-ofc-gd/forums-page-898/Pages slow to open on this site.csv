305178,Cast-Away,2009-02-12 00:27:00,790,I've been noticing for a few months now that pages are slow to open on this website. Even when you hit the back button I find the same thing. I noticed that at the bottom of the browser a message says waiting for googleads.g.doubleclick.net. Is the board site host using some tracking software that slows down the navigation between pages here? Does anyone know the answer to this or why the board is slower? I find it on any of my laptops. Both are quite new and run on different OS.

For the ads to work, google ""reads"" the page and then serves up as relevant of ads as it can.  Sometimes that may slow things down a bit.  Personally, im pn ""Hi Speed"" wireless and the site doesnt seem any slower than any others I visit."
305397,TJQ,2009-02-12 16:01:00,7806,I was thinking about it.... do you think our drain on international productivity has created the current financial crisis??  Maybe we have too many US bankers and auto workers lurking here.....
