303718,Stoty,2009-02-09 06:06:00,2910," Amen brother!! Gotta love a guy who picks his spots......    Have to agree with chickenhawk (for once)..... why chirp about a thread? you read the title, did you not? Don't like it...here's a simple answer... dont read it!"
303734,Spiel,2009-02-09 12:24:00,9065,I read 'em all.
303750,Mike Pike,2009-02-09 13:50:00,1332,I knew the Rangers would take Dallas' sloppy seconds.

303807,highdrifter,2009-02-09 15:47:00,2534,"Chicken you poor, simple little man.  Avery really turns your crank doesn't he?"
303816,Gerritt,2009-02-09 16:14:00,6129,  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!  :clapping:  :clapping:  :clapping:
303841,JohnF,2009-02-09 17:25:00,3494, I guess his spot picker was broken that day  JF
303854,addy79,2009-02-09 18:03:00,573,"Avery is actually a pretty smart hockey player...  grinders like him are a diime a dozen in the nhl, you would be amazed at how quickly and easily you can be watched by teams one minute and yesterdays news the next.  Avery has made a niche market for himself, he has differentiated his hockey SKILLS (and trust me he has em) to set himself apart from the pack. whether he has done this intentionally or by fluke is up in teh air, but nonetheless, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ROOM FOR AN AVERY IN THE N.  he pisses players off, can play when he wants to, and he attracts fans...why wouldnt there be a handfull of GM's interestetd in him???  hes got a big yapp adn its got him in hot water his entire hockey career, hes used to it, hes not gonna change it, too much....maybe lay off teh jokes about the ex.  at teh end of the day, love him or hate him, he has created a niche market for himself in a sea of players jumping at teh bit for a shot in teh big show.  MORE POWER TO EM!!!!!  "
303997,holdfast,2009-02-09 22:29:00,1813,"For Stoty and Uglyfish.  I did some research and I think you guys dont know what you're talking about.  You guys have been watching too much womans hockey.  Lets see what does Avery does and 90 percent of the Habs, Sens, Leafs don't do.  Bet ya he aint no Pussey. 1. Goes into corners 2. Drops the gloves 3. Goes for the net 4. Stands up for his team 5. aggravates the other teams 6. No I would not say he is a chicken, What I like about him is he is Canadian bred.  He knows what it means to win. Just to let you know, never said he won all his fights, yea hes got a big mouth. Hey, Id take him for the most of the Habs anyday. Hopefully his Sensitivity training didnt turn him into kinder, gentler, Sean Avery like. If so hes better off playing overseas.  We need a ""who likes Cherry Thread"".   Bet you will see a trend here with the Avery haters.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIrc9Db8NSE...feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaZwi169da0...feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDQBogfOEQw...feature=related"
304291,Stoty,2009-02-10 04:57:00,2910,"It's the Bull he pulls night in and night out. He is all about attention, good or bad.  What he doesn't realize is that he is an embarrassment to everyone, not just himself.  Does he drop the gloves....sure...but picks his spots most of the time, and when he doesnt..he gets beat (above links).  He is a class-less person, on and off the ice. Period."
304306,chickenhawk,2009-02-10 06:49:00,612,okay...i agree with stoty that he has no class....no one can deny that.....but what holdfast said was completely true.....make fun of me all you want but personally i think he is a valuable player i've said that many times.......he's not my favourite player he is just an exciting player to follow.....don't know what he is goin to do next....positive or negative....  Hawk
304468,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-10 17:06:00,2582,  I never made fun of you CH....but the ...i've said that many times...from your quote above is my point.  You have done Sean Avery to the point of silliness on here...pick something else. I'm pretty sure I am not the only one who feels this topic has been beaten to death. Let it die in peace.
304580,holdfast,2009-02-10 21:49:00,1813,"No, I like this thread, if you don't, why don't you skip it.  Yea I guess Avery is Controversial, I hope his Diversity training doesn't make him into a mindless, Hopelessness player that he wasn't before aka Mtl Canadians.  Don Cherry for Prime- Minister.  By the way, I think he dislikes Avery."
304760,buckster,2009-02-11 01:35:00,530,waste of board space!
304800,Cookslav,2009-02-11 02:22:00,1457," Bah.... He puts on a show, but thats about it. C'mon Holdy you must have played a bit to be such a fan. He's useing the old strait arm clutch every time. Oldest trick in the book when tossing with a guy you know is more then likely gonna kick yer little behind.  Grab the sweater cross arm to tie up the arms then keep your foe an arms length away with your head turned and way...way back. The distance keeps his pretty little face clean...sure he'll get some lumps on the back of his noggin but its all for show. Plus that little death grip on his opponents sweater gives him the ability to pull him close with head down to minimize the damage if the battle goes south...AKA the Turtle LOL! Sure he'll muck it up, but its all for show...he's not laying the beats to no one.  But! I'll meet you half way...he can play a grinders game better then half the Habs or leaf for sure! I just don't think his antics, or morals fit my idea of Canadian hockey.  A couple guys who played that ruff an tumble grinders game in the corners, and could draw penalties, and knock some teeth out when need be that come to mind... Wendle Clark, Cam Neely, Ricky Tocket....maybe even Mr Bertuzzi(allthough he's a case on his own) Avery could take a lesson from them on class for sure."
304876,holdfast,2009-02-11 05:50:00,1813,"I never really cared about the guy, especially when Cherry stated that he should of had his head cracked when he acted like an Idiot with the goalie.  However when this Avery thread emerged a while ago, I kind of started liking the Guy.  When guys call him a Pussy they have no Idea what they're talking about.  Lets see, sticking up to Iginla and Jovanowski, in my books that's not a pussy.  What is, well I wont mention names but only to say, if your a Habs fan, you'd be embarrassed on whats going on with that team the last few years.  If I was Gainy, I would take him and get rid of a half dozen Pussy Habs and call up some more young Guns.  At Least The Leafs are trying."
304883,Stoty,2009-02-11 06:32:00,2910," You also think that if people lose their jobs, they should suck it up and move.  Go figure......"
304900,Spiel,2009-02-11 11:30:00,9065,....and everybody lived happily ever after.  The End.
302781,chickenhawk,2009-02-07 14:43:00,612,talk is that the rangers are showing some interest in Avery again....apparently there is a couple other teams who are interested.....like to see him back in New York again.....prolly be somewhere before the end of the season though....anyone else have an opinion?
302782,Governator,2009-02-07 14:49:00,879,he should be playing pond hockey...
302783,Stoty,2009-02-07 14:51:00,2910,I think he should stick to playing with himself. Doesn't deserve to be in the NHL. I do not respect him at all.
302784,hotrod,2009-02-07 14:54:00,103,"If the ultimate cheap shot artist Claude ""pepe"" Lemieux can make a comeback at 43 why not Avery?"
302786,chickenhawk,2009-02-07 15:03:00,612,alot of ppl were pretty sure he would never play in the NHL again....but i'm glad to see talk of him coming back....i still think he is a key player when he wants to be....he is just a jerk and will act like it if he doesent like where he is just like what happened in Dallas....once/if he goes back to New York they always seemed to keep him under control.....and dont bring up the brodeur thing becuz when he did that....there was no rule...in my mind it was smart becuz he wasn't breaking any rules....
302822,JohnF,2009-02-07 16:44:00,3494, Why spoil it for the kids?  JF
302848,Maverick,2009-02-07 18:03:00,371,"He has no respect for anybody else, teammates included. He purposely breaks rules and doesn't listen. He doesn't deserve the spot on the roster over a player that's dream it is to play in the NHL."
302866,John,2009-02-07 19:09:00,2956, Hopefully somewhere where the ice is quite thin!  He is a damn liabilty to any team. They have rocks in their heads if they follow through and sign him. He has no respect for anyone including himself.
302993,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-07 23:09:00,2585,im sure some team will pick him up but why is the ??????  he is cancer in the dressing room ask his teammates  cheers!
303049,anders,2009-02-08 00:55:00,1168,"I would bring back McSorely too then, maybe lay some lumber up side his head and knock some sense into him.  Doesnt deserve to be back...hope he never comes back."
303341,holdfast,2009-02-08 17:49:00,1813,"I would trade him for half of the Mtl Canadians.  Pleckanic, Brisebois, Latundress, Koivu, Lapierre, Daneault, Kovelev for one Avery.  At least he isn a frady cat in the corners.  And hes a Canadian.  Fact is Rangers won more games with him then without him."
303367,chickenhawk,2009-02-08 19:09:00,612,well said.....the numbers dont lie
303383,uglyfish,2009-02-08 19:50:00,981,"  lol, he is a pussy!! he acts tough, tell me one time when he has dropped the gloves with ANY heavy weight in the league!! rite, he hasnt, when he does fight, he will fight someone whos not a fighter, but as soon as someone comes along that can fight he runs away and hides. hes got no respect for the game and if someone does deserve to have his ass pummelled its him!"
303391,chickenhawk,2009-02-08 20:11:00,612,yeah but that guy that fights keeps coming after him and avery draws a penalty....power play....most goals are scored on the power play....
303395,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-08 20:33:00,3761,"lol Sean Avery is a funny dude, hope he makes a return soon also."
303401,snoil,2009-02-08 20:45:00,139,Yeah Dallas really went into the tank when he stopped playing...The waving the arms thing rule or no rule was classless.The mans a jerk.Let him work for GQ or whatever hockey doesn't need him.
303473,diggyj,2009-02-08 22:48:00,548,"Whatever you thin about him, he is a decent player and will make any team better, if he keeps a staright head. He will be in the AHL for a bit first, then probably be picked up after clearing waivers."
303487,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 23:14:00,8163,  Maybe you should practice posting Hockey pics now... so you'll be able to post fish pics this summer and fall?
303507,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-08 23:41:00,2582, Since you asked for my opinion....here it is. I think this Forum would be better served if you would stop talking about the guy. Since you seem to be the only one to continuously bring him up. The only reason i ever open these threads is just to see if someone else has requested you talk about that idiot somewhere else as well.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE leave him outta here...there that's my opinion.
303512,BassAsin,2009-02-08 23:45:00,806,"hahahah i think its funny that truck talk and electronics and a broken solar panel topic always becomes a hot topic but a topic of avery which is also NF gets boooooooed      why is that?  bring him back i say. why not, doesnt affect my life if he plays in the N or not"
303522,buckster,2009-02-08 23:52:00,530, CPH I couldnt have said it any better myself!     Do you have a life sized poster of him in your room?
303524,Spiel,2009-02-08 23:58:00,9065,    
303619,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-09 01:35:00,2582, I don't care what anyone says....that's funny right there
303716,chickenhawk,2009-02-09 05:46:00,612,meh everyone is entitled to their opinion so i am happy to see him come back.....hey GCD....mind your own business if you don't like it.....and for those others....the post was clearly titled i was talkin about sean avery.....it was for those who wanted to talk about his return.......nuff said....
303717,BassAsin,2009-02-09 05:55:00,806,"good point if you dont wanna talk about it keep the arrogant remarks to ones self, it;s not an obligation to make a comment on a thread is it?"
