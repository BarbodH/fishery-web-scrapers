304443,kemper,2009-02-10 16:06:00,2232,"Thats a tank.   I love the comments too, some people are completely clueless.  ""If you catch it, eat it. Catching it for sport is just immoral""  right..."
304448,Lunker777,2009-02-10 16:15:00,866,hmmm its not showing up for me ! says the video has been removed  and yes... you gotta love the comments eh ? Some people just dont know !
304449,jwl,2009-02-10 16:18:00,1056,"that is a huge bass and I realize in some places there are different regs than here  what bugged me was comments like....""get out there every day during the spawning season""  and also the fact that they retained a snagged fish to bring it in and get weighed ect on a rope....if that where here in Ontario, soon as the fish was put on a stringer, that's an illegally kept snagged fish  25lbs sure is one honkin bucket for sure"
304451,OhioFisherman,2009-02-10 16:33:00,6623,LOL nice fish from a 70 acre pond?  http://www.californiagameandfish.com/fishi...g/ca_aa010704a/  Must be the trout diet!
304459,BigSmallie,2009-02-10 16:39:00,61,Spawning season is when the big ones are at their heaviest. It's a fact of life fishing the spawn in the south and the next world record will be a spawning fish without a doubt. The next world record was caught but the hook was on the outside of the mouth and California laws say that it has to be inside the mouth so he let it go. 'Dottie' had been watched for years by one angler and she ended up being found dead presumably dying of old age.  A 'snagged' fish in California is different than a snagged fish here. If you catch a fish with a jerkbait and the hooks pull out of the mouth or the fish get stuck outside the mouth that is a legal fish in Ontario as you weren't purposely trying to snag the fish in California your supposed to release that same fish.
304461,jwl,2009-02-10 16:45:00,1056,"I personally..""legal"" or not would never consider a fish caught ""around"" the mouth a legal fish"
304495,hammercarp,2009-02-10 18:17:00,964,"I don't know. I seems to me that fishing for bass during the spawn is wrong. Basically this guy cruises the egde of the lake in the shallows and when he spots an egg laiden female he tries to entice a strike out of her, in order to get one at it's heaviest. This last catch was snagged. I think there is a difference between sportsmanship and gamesmenship."
304515,cram,2009-02-10 19:32:00,1733,Catching a spawning bass is just wrong.   And too easy to be considered an accomplishment.   They will bite pepsi cans when they're spawning.
304522,Paully,2009-02-10 19:53:00,712,Foul hooked or not... Thats one nice Bass!
304533,purekgw,2009-02-10 20:13:00,585,i think it ate a small dog
304545,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-10 20:42:00,3761,wow 25lbs...Would that of been the world record largemouth bass if it were legally caught?  What a amazing fish
304587,Marko,2009-02-10 22:02:00,854,"Great fish, almost as fat as some of the carp swimming around I dont agree with the way they fish, just cruising around looking for nice fat bass during spawning season. At the end they did the right thing and let the fish go."
304634,BigSmallie,2009-02-10 23:26:00,61,"That fish was worth millions in endorsements.  The way they hunted that fish was no different than hunting an animal. You pre-scout, sometime bait the area and wait for that perfect time and opportunity to take your shot. These guys spent a lot of time on the water for that one shot and got unlucky. Could be years before another one like that comes along.  Here's the follow up article  http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing...ecord_bass_dies"
304679,musky66,2009-02-11 00:16:00,273,"Sorry, looked like shooting fish in a barrel to me. I wouldn't consider that 'fishing'"
304682,purekgw,2009-02-11 00:20:00,585,to bad that dottie died
304715,BigSmallie,2009-02-11 00:54:00,61,That wasn't actual footage of them catching the fish......that was actual footage on the dock.  That guy spent 70 days in a row on the water if that's not fishing than I don't know what is. To catch the same fish 5 years later is incredible. To have a shot at pitching a jig to the Biggest Freaking Bass in the World is nothing short of astounding! But I guess your right thats not what fishing is all about.......pass me the worms and a bobber......
304772,purekgw,2009-02-11 01:50:00,585,ill have to catch a 28lb large mouth this summer and become famous
304834,pike slayer,2009-02-11 03:03:00,1177,i would have kept my mouth shut about the snagging lol
304882,cram,2009-02-11 06:31:00,1733," Exciting for sure, and an admirable conquest....but fishing for spawning bass just isn`t fishing.  They strike more in defense of their nest than to eat...."
