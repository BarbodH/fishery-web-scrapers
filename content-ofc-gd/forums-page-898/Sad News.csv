305041,Ron,2009-02-11 16:52:00,1683,"Thank you very much for your kind thoughts, flowers and all the emails.  It is a great relief to have friends like you to help in such times.  The last few days our family has been going through things our Mom had. It brought back lots of great memories and anyone that knows me certainly knows there was lots of laughter. I think I now know where I got my jouster personality form. Every picture we looked at had a funny story. We frequently brought out the photos and reminisced often, long before Mom was ill. One thing that touched our hearts with Mom was the collection of silly little nicknack's we had gotten for her over the years. To see such a lady holding on to these keep sakes really took hold of us all. I think the most cherished one would be a poem one of my brothers gave to her many moons ago, it was laminated on a plaque and was on top of the cupboard with all the pictures. Mom knew we would like to read this at this time.   GOD bless all.  Cheers, Ron"
