273914,JerseyDog,2008-12-01 04:02:00,190," Is that a real pickeral on the ice, or were you just calling your six walleye pickeral so we would know what you were talking about?"
273919,Beats,2008-12-01 04:18:00,543,  That's what I was thinking.  The first fish is sure looking like a pike.. unless its a chain/grass pickerel.  I assume that's what he means.
273933,jediangler,2008-12-01 07:46:00,1923,That is a real pickeral   .
273938,Ranger22,2008-12-01 10:08:00,18,Yea that's a chain pickeral not a good pic it flopped right when i snapped it.
273961,JerseyDog,2008-12-01 13:18:00,190,"So if we as canucks call walleye pickeral, what are we supposed to call pickeral - mini pike? walleye?"
273970,jediangler,2008-12-01 13:58:00,1923,We should call them what they are.
