272684,Rich,2008-11-27 21:03:00,3927,"Figured I might as well post a year end review for 2008, cuz it's the in-thing!  The year started with winter carp in January.. we had a nice warm front which lead to the biggest in the Lynn River for me.      Continuing with the warm trend, there was panfish in the local canals. Many good days were had!    Temps finally dropped again, but since ice fishing wasn't so easy for us being stuck without a ride, we pounded some winter carp which were surprisingly co-operative for us.      We finally did get out in the ice a few times, perch being the main target. Sugarpacket even nailed her PB out there.      Next was the spring channel cats and carp in the Lake Erie tribs.      And another Sugarpacket PB ensued.    Then of course there was our trip out east to Nova Scotia. Didn't plan to do much fishing out there - won't make that mistake next time. Fished mostly browns and specks and had a great time.    As things warmed a little more, bigger carp came out to play.. for everyone but me. lol        Sorry bout the logos.. not trying a cheap plug they were meant to only be shown on my site.  I finally hooked up with some big cats too.    When trout opened we had some good days locally on the streams.        Who can forget the day of PB's in Dunnville.. PB sheephead that is!      Musky opener was fun for Sleded and I on our annual camping trip. I boated one musky this whole year and that was on opening day, but we saw a bunch that trip and after that even locally. I still have a heck of a lot to learn about musky fishing.        Carp were in their full swing of spawning, Sugarpacket and I took advantage catching some post spawners.  Sugarpacket's biggest Lynn River carp:   My biggest Lake Erie run fish of the year - unfortunately   Then came the bass & pike for the next few months!          Another Sugarpacket PB:        Fall set in, and the bass/pike just got hungrier!            And that brings us to now.. a little bit of perchin' and a little bit of carpin'      Obviously, I can't sum up all of the year's fish or fishing experiences into a whack of pictures. There's too much to share, too much to write. First off I'd like to thank everybody that came out and fished with us this year:  Sleded, Red Devil, Crappieperchhunter, Johnny Bass, The Urban Fisherman, Slowpoke, Arnaldo De Sousa, Markus.. if I missed anyone else I'm sorry! lol  Secondly, I can't begin to describe how thankful I am that I have such an understanding significant other.. the fact that she loves to fish too - well that's just like winning the lottery. Sugarpacket had a heck of a year, slamming PB's in just about everything we fished for. For some reason I can't find her PB pike pic.. it was a modest fish at 31 inches from a pond. Splenda also caught his first fish this year - a sunfish, unfortunately we weren't armed with a camera at the time so we'll just have to go on the memory of that. I'm sure by the middle of next year he'll be slamming PB's and showing us elders how to fish! Totally psyched for that.  And of course we'd both love to give OFC a big thank you. Thanks for the advice, encouragement, and enjoyment of fishing vicariously through the rest of you while we weren't on the water. Without you all, we'd often be lost and I gotta say fishing just wouldn't be quite so enjoyable.  It's been a great year - but it's not over yet. Let's pound that water hard next month!  Thanks again,  Richard & Candice"
272694,pigeonfisher,2008-11-27 21:20:00,696,"It looks like a good year, Rich.  Nice that you and Candice can enjoy the time together on (or around) the water."

272776,crappieperchhunter,2008-11-27 23:46:00,2582,Excellent report Rich. it was nice to get down your way in April to try for my fish Big Cat. I enjoyed sharing the evening with you two.  Keep the reports coming and good luck in the future. Splenda will be joining in before you know it.

273497,Sugarpacket,2008-11-30 02:38:00,82,"Yea gotta love a trophy fluke! Rich didn't come close to my PB this year (which is a first), and my cats are always bigger too. It was nice to find out I don't have to be in labour to catch big catfish (even though it's more fun that way)."
