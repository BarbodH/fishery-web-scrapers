274169,ScugogBoy,2008-12-01 21:54:00,36,"Mr. Glen.........I'm new here, but from reading your past posts and reports.....maybe your seeing things in the sky that are not there....lay off the Bama Moonshine-is my advice...."

274218,Greencoachdog,2008-12-01 23:54:00,8163," Welcome to the site SB!!!... you study well my little Grasshopper! ... I have seen stuff in the sky (Bat country) that wasn't there in the past (distant), but this is real!  Join us at Lakair this June and you can drink from the bottle of Redneck secrets (providing you're of legal age) and you'll see stuff you aint nevah seen before!!!  "
274267,shane,2008-12-02 01:42:00,652,"I just read on another site that those two lights are not really venus and jupiter but are actually secret, non-government, corporate elite satellites and that when they get close enough together will be able to combine their radio frequencies and send some kind of weird brain washing beam back down to earth and mess with our minds.  I dunno.  Sounds kind of fishy to me but I'm putting an extra layer of foil on my hat tonight just in case.  Actually it could explain why I started getting unexplainable urges to buy a Dodge truck last night."
274276,Greencoachdog,2008-12-02 02:01:00,8163,Thanks for the heads-up on that one FB!!!  I'm going to duck and cover 'til sunrise just to be on the safe side!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiI62AZTQw8
