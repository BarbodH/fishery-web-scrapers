274206,carp-starter,2008-12-01 23:22:00,253,I think it is a joke but a very serious situation.  The commie NDP leader Jack Layton said on TV that there is no confidence in the government.  But the problem is that the people did not vote for the Troika that hopes to lead. It is a JOKE.  They are all playing games at our expense and our money.  It appears that Stéphane Dion will have his 15 minutes of fame.  I will never vote again.  What do you guys say about the situation???  carp-starter

274220,bushart,2008-12-01 23:58:00,2628,Majority of Canadians Did NOT vote for Stephen (Bush) Harper...so fill your boots...This is Canada and this is our rules so we all live and die by them.  Tell the 60 some odd percent of voters from the last election that they're wrong---see what they tell ya.
