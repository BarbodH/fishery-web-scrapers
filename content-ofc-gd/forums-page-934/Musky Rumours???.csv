273640,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-30 17:50:00,1362," If you own a Sports Fishing license, and the fish was within the legal size limit for possession, why would it be a BIG DEAL to kill it and do whatever it was you wanted to do with it????????????......What's the difference between killing a possible record fish compared to killing a record Moose which by the way was posted not too long ago on this site????......I don't recall that lad being raked over the coals for that kill???  Am I missing something here??"

273645,cram,2008-11-30 17:57:00,1733,  Not raking anyone over the coals.  I just wouldn't kill it.

Cram, playing (or being) ignorant is not helping you:  search for ""record Muskie"" and you will find the same thread over and over again. If there is a record muskie then I would like to read about it too.  Despite your belief this is not a thread about an actual record muskie.  It is fiction, I will say it again....this thread is fiction.   Maybe your brain idles along like that but I take in what I read.....the message headers appear in the forum list, I read those headers to find posts.  forrest"
273656,cram,2008-11-30 18:14:00,1733," I guess we`ll see, won`t we.  And yes, your brain should be able to sort which threads you want to read, which ones don`t interest you, and direct your fingers to click on those ones."
273657,jwl,2008-11-30 18:19:00,1056,"so...why is everyone arguing or whatever about a fish nobody from the board may or may not have caught  if someone caught a record musky..good on them, that's what most musky anglers try to do..catch the BIG ONE, and if they didn't catch one...so what it's not like anyone on here's life is gonna instantly change the second we find out"
273661,forrest,2008-11-30 18:31:00,1032," Yes, Cram, my brain does that.  I am usually conscience of the process though.  Like I said.  I take in what I read.  I guess its absolute stupidity of this thread that gets me going.  I am not sure what your waiting to see  At this point this thread is fiction and it sounds like you agree or maybe not.  Maybe theses topics of similar stature should be posted on a regular basis?:  -world record sasquatch caught in Quebec! -Elvis Presley seen shopping at Bass Pro! -Jesus resurected, seen shopping at Cabelas! -Alien base found at the deepest parts of Lake Ontario! -Mermaid caught in Lake Simcoe!  forrest"
273662,lew,2008-11-30 18:31:00,12767,Very sad to see the way some interesting threads can go into a nose-dive so fast  Very sad indeed.....
273548,Smokey,2008-11-30 13:47:00,1278,This fish was caught by a well respected member of MCI. Other members have infact seen the pics and talked with him about the fish.  So your just going to have to wait for the pics and the story from him.  I can guarentee one thing being a MCI member I'll see the pics and hear all about it before most of you and I can't wait.
273553,darsky,2008-11-30 13:58:00,586,Sam Hill???
273554,Greencoachdog,2008-11-30 14:01:00,8163,  Aren't all MCI members well respected?... or are some less respected than others???
273556,Smokey,2008-11-30 14:05:00,1278,  Nothing better to do today then try to stir up crap today?
273557,Greencoachdog,2008-11-30 14:12:00,8163,"  It's a wet, soggy, rainy Sunday morning Smoke, and I'm just tryin' to keep all y'all MCI members at the top of the list!"
273558,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-30 14:13:00,1362, WOW....what a perk to being an MCI member!!  Hopefully the pics will include shots of the measuring tape showing girth and length
273565,Guest gbfisher,2008-11-30 14:49:00,0,What a joke. Its because of the MCI and others that the first record went to ..  Bunch of Whooowy anyway.To much crap over one fish.  Hope they keep it to themselves......  Measuring tape .........BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.................................
273567,joonmoon,2008-11-30 14:59:00,528,Bring on the photos...can't wait to see the fish and the look on the anglers face...should be outstanding.
273568,cram,2008-11-30 15:12:00,1733,  That's the thing.   If it is a genuine record fish (and it sounds like it is) I think its fantastic that the guy released it.   Cared more about that then getting the IGFA record.
273570,Dano,2008-11-30 15:22:00,719,"Lol! God I love what these big fish can do to normally (mostly?) civilized folks, foul play, death threats not to mention good old beatings!!!  Its entertainment of the highest order!"

273574,napjohn8,2008-11-30 15:29:00,46,"hey guys i heard about it too, for a world record though one would need a certified scale and biologist on board if its catch and release, how can you release a world record fish, btw canadian muskies members site should have pics by today."
273575,Crazyhook,2008-11-30 15:34:00,1154," IS anyone here a member of the IGFA? First of all, if all the proper measurements were taken and the fish was weighed on a certified scale it CAN be a world record. A scale can be submitted to the IGFA even after the fact to be certified.  The fact is a big fish was caught and every fall this happens. Lets all wait for the photos . The St Lawrence has traditionally produced the longest muskies in the world. In the fall these long fish do beef up. If a record is to be broken the Larry has my vote  Signed, IGFA member Jamie"
273577,F7Firecat,2008-11-30 15:42:00,347,pocorn anyone???  the show is just starting..........
273578,Greencoachdog,2008-11-30 15:45:00,8163," To be an IGFA record, the fish has to be killed and the stomach contents examined and verified!... guess why."
273582,Smokey,2008-11-30 15:58:00,1278,"  Agreed  Seems to be not much more here then a bunch of miserable, bitter people lately.  Had enough  Mike  See ya all"

273603,cram,2008-11-30 16:56:00,1733, Would you kill a fish like that?
273608,forrest,2008-11-30 17:01:00,1032,"World record Musky threads without fact rate right up there   :  -Threads that misrepresent that picture of the 43lb  pike caught in Holland a year or 2 ago (I ain't gonna post it). - Nigerian scam emails - ""get large fast"" emails - Elvis is still alive!  Its a rookie mistake to post one....something else to let it go on and on and on and on and on........every time I look the thread gets bumped  back up to the top.  Do bass, trout or salmon guys carry on like this? How about a category to list all these looser threads so I don't have to see them anymore?  forrest  PS...GCD you had a good point about examining the fish contents...but can't we just let it die?"
273610,cram,2008-11-30 17:07:00,1733," I for one am very excited to see the pics.   Why is it a ""rookie mistake"" to post about a record (if it is genuine and legit)?"
273613,trapshooter,2008-11-30 17:11:00,1234,"  How true.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.   If they had have killed it they would take as much or more crap for that.  Tough situation.  I'd just like to see a picture of a big muskie.  Congrats to who ever caught this fish.  Ben"
273617,forrest,2008-11-30 17:20:00,1032,  I think you answered your own question:  There is no reference to show it is genuine and legit.  This thread is like a smoking addiction....it just doesn't die.  Even when you think it is dead it rears its ugly head a few months later.  forrest  PS: where are the exterminators?
273623,johnnyb,2008-11-30 17:25:00,3413," Abso-tively, posi-lutely!  How many long and ridiculous threads are there about a 6 lb. bass that is way bigger or way smaller than someone else's 6 lb. bass?  How long, ugly and pathetic do the threads get about river etiquette, marshmallows, and what kind of salmon it is that was actually caught?  Someone caught a big muskie.  AWEsome!  Can't wait to see the pics, but couldn't care less about whether it's a record  If and when someone who catches a record fish decides to authenticate it, well, that'll be cool too.  Hopefully the guy at Muskie Jake's bar and grill will get his hands on the mount and add it to the wall."
273624,cram,2008-11-30 17:26:00,1733,"  This thread was started yesterday about a fish from friday (or was it yesterday?).   What ""few months later"" are you talking about?  Besides, the beauty of a messageboard is that you can choose what you read and what you don't.  There are no magic hands in your computer reaching out, grabbing your head, and forcing you to read this.  Anyway, if there is a new record fish (verified for the igfa or not) i am very interested in reading more about it."
273356,tonka-toy,2008-11-29 19:22:00,139,I've heard some rumours that a musky was caught on the St.Lawrence measuring at 57 by 33 inches. Anyone else hear anything about this??

273519,Weekend Angler,2008-11-30 04:37:00,13,"Hi Folks;  Not a rumour it's for real. One of our Ottawa members and his wife (who are having an outstanding year) were fishing with one of our Gan members. 57""x33"" is the reported dimensions. With all the crap that's going to go with it they will probably wish they just bonked it... Glad to see it released though, awesome fish apparently.  There are some good pictures that have been witnessed by a number of other members including the Gan chairman who has caught a 60"" himself so he has some perspective on big fish. The pics won't be available until Sunday when they get back.  Like everyone else I am waiting patiently...  Editor Muskies Canada"
273525,cram,2008-11-30 08:02:00,1733, You're calling someone a liar without knowing anything about the catch or the person who caught it.
273536,Greencoachdog,2008-11-30 11:16:00,8163," Nope!  That was just my recipe for a rumor, and I didn't say always... I said usually.  I also said it's that way where I come from, it may be different up there... but I doubt it.  ... are you calling me an   -hole?"
273539,Greencoachdog,2008-11-30 11:28:00,8163," Yeah... I like that!... ""reported dimensions"" ... I wonder if they'll vary from the ""actual dimensions""  If it was C&R, it won't be an IGFA world record."
