273406,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 22:10:00,612,Wow what a 2nd half Georgia Tech had with a great comeback and were able to hang on for the win.....first time Georgia Tech has beaten the bulldogs in the last 7 times they've met.....anyone watch any other exciting games today?
273444,Greencoachdog,2008-11-30 00:45:00,8163,I really like the Alabama/Auburn game final score!!!
273445,TennesseeGuy,2008-11-30 00:47:00,957,"Yeah, Hawk, it was a great win for Georgia Tech.  Getting  a win late in the season against a team like Georgia is especially good for a team like Georgia Tech, that is loaded with scholars.  Those engineers lost valuable practice time to books and labs.  Georgia probably spent at least 30% more time preparing for this one than did Georgia Tech.  Didn't see it as I was supporting our local university by watching their win on the basketball court this afternoon.  Will Saxby Chambliss win in Georgia Tuesday?"
273579,chickenhawk,2008-11-30 15:47:00,612, of course you did.....Alabama hasn't lost yet...lol....they will get beat tho...don't worry   Hawk
