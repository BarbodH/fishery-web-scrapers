273626,pike slayer,2008-11-30 17:28:00,1177,hey guys my buddy has a homemade trailer that his dad built years ago to fit 2 tundras side by side. the tundras are long gone and we have regular width sleds now. they both wont fit side by side. we want to widen it out but dont know what the widest legal width is?
273630,Dondorfish,2008-11-30 17:33:00,1000,I believe that it is 102 inches or 8 foot 6 inches.  Don  
273631,DRIFTER_016,2008-11-30 17:33:00,10439,Maximum width on most highways is 8'.  Here are Federal lighting and safety regs.  Trailer Regs

273675,irishfield,2008-11-30 19:37:00,26272,"Yep.. 8' 6"" and we can thank MCI and Greyhound for pushing that up from the old 8' from back when their buses got wider in the mid 70's and they weren't allowed on Ontario Roads for a while."
