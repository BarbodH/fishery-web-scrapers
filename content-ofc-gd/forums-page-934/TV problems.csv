273581,GBW,2008-11-30 15:56:00,8460,"Samsung is the largest lcd glass manufacture in the world so they make lots of products for others, even more so when it comes to laser printers."
273745,bow slayer,2008-11-30 23:39:00,1074,just went through this myself ended up with a Samsung 50 inch plasma. Like someone said earlier Plasma is the better picture over LCD.If you are putting it in a light controlled room go for for plasma.  D o not pay an extra 4-500 dollars for a 1080  p unless you have a blu-ray player or plan on buying one. All HD signals for satelite or rogers is in 720 p and will be for many more years.
273760,SBCregal,2008-12-01 00:02:00,688,"ive got my eye on the pn50a550 plasma from samsung, just waiting for the right prices. good reviews on that set"
273762,BillM,2008-12-01 00:05:00,17367,"550 Series from Samsung are decent, if you don't mind a little bling, check out the 750 series...  LG also has some nice plasma's...  My next one will be a Pioneer Elite, but that won't be for a while"
273763,forrest,2008-12-01 00:05:00,1032," OTA signals are 1080P right now and I think that most everyone will have a Blue-Ray player within 5 years....it will take off like DVD now that the format war is over.  I still have a CRT so I can't say how much nicer 1080P looks over 720P.  Someone here said to check out avsforums and another forum, that was good advice.  forrest"
273793,Dutch,2008-12-01 01:02:00,831," Sorry to disagree - but there are no terrestrial 1080P signals anywhere, not even OTA, Blu-Ray is the only place to get them currently.  An OTA signal can be ""upconverted"" to 1080P using the TV's built-in scaler, but there probably won't be any appreciable increase in picture quality.  All upconverting does is guess at the pixels that aren't there and displays a pixel it thinks should go in that spot.  Kind of like an upconverting DVD player that displays 480P DVD's as either 720P, 1080i or 1080P - still no where near the quality of a ""real"" Blu-Ray in 720P, 1080i or 1080P.  Also - take Consumer Reports reccomendations with a grain of salt - too many useless (for most buyers) variables included, like price, remote control ease of use, on-screen display/memu ease of use etc.  The only reason that Vizio was anywhere near the top is that it is cheap!  The only rating that should have anything to do with buying a TV is picture Quality.  Like I said earlier - do the reasearch and you will find the right TV for you."
273797,forrest,2008-12-01 01:15:00,1032," NO need to be sorry....forgive my error, its 1080i (brain is fried)...my info is about 2 years old....aged and faulty  Discussing HDTV tech specs in a fishing forum is like discussing tournament fishing tactics in the avs forums.  forrest"
273802,Dutch,2008-12-01 01:22:00,831,"I agree about the discussion of specs, sorry about that.  Two things in this world I love the most (beside my wife,) fishing and Home Theatre - I get carried away when worlds collide...."

273917,bow slayer,2008-12-01 04:11:00,1074,"the 1080p will only make a difference if you have a blu-ray player,everything else is 720p."
273981,BillM,2008-12-01 14:25:00,17367, ...or PS3 or Xbox 360   Not like anyone can tell the difference between 1080i and 1080p anyhow.   Although I am sure there are a few that swear they can tel the difference

273498,holdfast,2008-11-30 02:41:00,1813," I just picked up a December 2008 Consumers Report Titled Best of electronics.  out of 10 categories (sreen size, LCD or Plasma)  Samsung were # 1   (6 of 10 categories) a Samsung 720 p was rated above a Panasonic 1080P but was cheaper by $700 An Insignia and Vizio were rated as great values for 50"" Sanyo had fewer repairs for LCD while an LG was up there for the most Panasonic had fewer while LG had the most in the plasma, but we are talking within 5% of top and bottom  My point is, price will not mean its better, read up on it.  And you can't go wrong with a Panasonic or Samsung.  Pioneer, looking at the chart tells me, your only paying for its name.  Sony better reduce their price to compete with Samsung, because they are no better"

One thing to note, some times a MFG of the TV has firmware updates on the site for your new TV as well to help it perform better.  I know that my TV was 2 revisions behind out of the box from what is current."
273515,holdfast,2008-11-30 04:00:00,1813," Actually the LN46A550 was rated as the Top 46-47' LCD, next was a Vizio that scored 5 points less.  The Samsung was Rated Picture Quality,  HD Excellent, DVD Excellent, Standard definition Excellent, Viewing angle average, sound Quality very good, Remote Excellent, according to CR.  Not sure what the difference between your model and CRs, Maybe one is American Brand?"
