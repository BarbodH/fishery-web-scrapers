273859,tnt,2008-12-01 03:02:00,63,"Well,  I'm finally heading back to Ontario after spending a few years working in Alberta.  Were heading out for the long drive on Dec. 16 which should put us back in the Niagara region sometime on the 18th.  I can't wait.....neither can my Dad!  It's been a while since I have been able to post a report and see some of my friends from years past.  I have an ice fishing trip booked already for the beginning of January on Nippissing and am looking forward to posting a report....hopefully with pics.  Anyways  see you all soon!  Todd"

274015,John,2008-12-01 15:58:00,2956,Welcome back Todd.
274025,tjsa,2008-12-01 16:29:00,1578,"Todd, while on the drive back(if you are indeed driving), when you are going through the Ignace area of Northwestern Ontario, do the speed limit!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's locally known as ""Wayne's World""   :lol:  :lol:  Wayne(I forget his last name) is the local OPP officer in that area, and is very, very, intimidating. Anything slightly ""hinky"" gets his attention."
274033,TJQ,2008-12-01 16:55:00,7806,Welcome back!!!
274087,douG,2008-12-01 19:03:00,2693,"I remember that guy!  It will be great to have you back, Todd.  Have a safe trip."
274215,Garry2Rs,2008-12-01 23:42:00,1425,Buck and I will be looking forward to seeing you-guys in the Spring. We will be back around the first week of April. Maybe we can do something for the Pike opener again!?!? Garry2rs
274352,tnt,2008-12-02 03:49:00,63,Thanks everyone.  There's still tons of work out here if your in the trades and the oil industry.  But the cost of living is definitely higher than southern Ontario.  And if you like being able to buy your brand of beer anywhere.....this province isn't for you :-)  Housing is much better than when I first arrived here...the cost of homes has gone down and there are lots of apartments for rent if you want to go that way.  Thanks for the heads up tjsa.  I did the drive about a year and a half ago and stayed right on the limit through all of northern Ontario.  Makes it easier to take in the nice scenery up there.  Hey Garry!  We would love to do something for the Pike opener......I've been missing out the last few seasons.  How's life been treating you down south?
274360,fishdawg,2008-12-02 03:52:00,912,good to see your still doing well Todd... maybe see ya out on Lake O this spring?
