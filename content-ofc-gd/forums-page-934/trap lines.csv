Not much money, a ton of work and only for a short time through the year. Not sure if a Trap line would be the same way but I don't see why not."
273500,pike slayer,2008-11-30 02:48:00,1177,why does a native get first choice? shouldnt everyone these days are equal and be a first come first serve? just my thoughts
273505,holdfast,2008-11-30 03:09:00,1813,Absolutely not the case.
273513,muskyhunter5150,2008-11-30 03:48:00,64,I would think it should be up to the indians as it was kind of there land before it got tooken over.
273526,cram,2008-11-30 08:09:00,1733,If that's the case i think its fair.  A far more prominent part of their heritage than ours.

Generally trap lines are sold of to those who are eligible (have their trappers license) as for who gets first choice, I do not see how it would be given to anyone in priority, equal rights to wildlife I would imagine off of the reserves"
