273249,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 13:31:00,612,whats so funny bout that? it's proven...SMALLMOUTH EAT LEECHES.....it was and still is my favourite thing to use for smallies....i think your jus running out of insults GCD.....grow up dude how old are you anyways?  callin a deceased person foolish on a site that he was a member of.....nice guy.....show some respect   Hawk
273266,Greencoachdog,2008-11-29 14:00:00,8163," I'm sorry chicken, but what Rich said just struck me as funny!!!    Na, i got a million of them... but I do think you're in need of a good spell check program!!!    Try to stick to the topic on this thread... or is that more than your widdle mind can handle?"
273279,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 14:59:00,612,k
273372,Rich,2008-11-29 20:22:00,3927,"I'm sorry Chickenhawk, I didn't mean to insult you in any way, I really was clueless that you worked at a lodge.. I was wondering if you became part owner or something, my mistake - guess I don't pay enough attention around here. lol  As for the leeches.. nothing wrong with that if it's your bag. I guess I'm just spoiled by Lake Erie smallies all the time, where live bait is very, very rarely necessity."
273404,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 21:51:00,612,never did take offense to it....jus felt the need to explain myself....good fishin Rich!   Hawk
273457,cram,2008-11-30 01:38:00,1733,"I fish smallmouth all the time and live leeches (or crayfish if you can get them) are by far the best bait.  Rich - you may think you don't *need* them but i guarantee they put more fish in your boat then artificials.  Especially on a smaller fly-in lake.  Thanks for posting this.  I would LOVE to find a backlake for musky that i can hike into.  This obviously isn't that one, but great to know they exist."
273537,chickenhawk,2008-11-30 11:23:00,612,"most of the lakes that we offer as fly in day trips, George has stocked years ago, im not sure about Irregular but I know there used to be alot of muskies in Umfreville Lake and then it flooded and is now part of what we know as the English River, actually Chase has some memory of stocking a lake with his grandfather at a young age......there still is the odd musky kickin around the English River, there was 2 of them caught this year from our lodge and both released....so hopefully they continue to breed and it will be a good musky fishery within the next few years.   Hawk"
272957,chickenhawk,2008-11-28 15:58:00,612,"Well my friend Chase Halley sent me these pictures the other day of the 2 trips he had at Irregular lake one of the fly in lakes offered at Halley's and I was so impressed I thought I'd share em with you guys....I never got to go to Irregular although Chase and I were supposed to go but my time for the summer was up b4 we got a chance but anyways here you go guys....  First is a picture from the plane...   Next up is Chase with a beaut..   same fish....   and another that Chaser picked up that day...   and now here is George Halley, my boss on a cold day at Irregular with another nice fish   and once again his grandson Chase..   CHEEEEEEEEEESE.....sorry thats what I called him all summer lol   Chaser's biggest on that day...   and hey what do you know there is big pike in Irregular too!    anyways hope you guys enjoyed the pics....jus thought u guys might be interested....till next time   Hawk"
272959,Pachone,2008-11-28 16:00:00,276,Friggen sweet report... especially that pike on the end...  Thanks hawk
272965,Wild,2008-11-28 16:11:00,704,Nice assortment for a small lake
272976,chickenhawk,2008-11-28 16:57:00,612,"believe me Wild....u choose the species of fish between musky, pike, bass, walleye, and lake trout we have 1 or more fly in lakes for each species, heck there is even a lake full of perch that George was telling Chase and myself about....the bass lakes are UNREAL...the day i went i figured out a pattern that they were hitting on and put well over 40+ fish in the boat that day while Chase was at the same lake on the same day and only put 10 in the boat.....but still thats 50 or more fish between 2 boats it don't get much better than that......im jus waitin for a crack at Irregular....this summer hopefully! lol  Hawk"
272991,Wild,2008-11-28 17:40:00,704,Yes I am intrigued... also looking for the fly in lake that holds the elusive grandma muskie
272993,fishingisliving,2008-11-28 17:46:00,170,Nice fish! Great trip!
272995,irishfield,2008-11-28 17:56:00,26272,Irregular Lake hummmm... Back in a bit... lol
272996,chickenhawk,2008-11-28 17:56:00,612,lol fil...that aint no trip....that's jus a day in the life of the Halley family lol must be nice eh? lol thx for the response ill pass it on   Hawk   PS i like your style Irish! lol
273003,Leecher,2008-11-28 18:24:00,7832,Great pics hawk  Thanks for sharing Leechman
273025,fishingisliving,2008-11-28 19:32:00,170,"oh... i guess for some people taking the subway is for a ""trip"" downtown, others do it every day because its quick and efficient.. I guess the same goes for a float plane :-)  anyway, nice fish! :-)"
273065,Rich Clemens,2008-11-28 22:19:00,3131,Sweet fish.  I'm beginning to forget what they look like.  Thank goodness for other's pics.
273086,Rizzo,2008-11-28 23:15:00,4754,awesome...one of these days I'll book myself a fly-in trip
273087,irishfield,2008-11-28 23:16:00,26272,I'm just hoping it's not really called Irregular Lake or someone's gonna have an X boss that's real ticked.
273178,muskyhunter5150,2008-11-29 03:03:00,64,"Great report, looks like youhad a good time."
273189,Pigeontroller,2008-11-29 03:19:00,2793,"Wayne, I doubt there's gonna be a swarm of OFNers headed to NW Ontario...   Nice Pics!"
273200,kemper,2008-11-29 03:35:00,2232,How far north do the Muskies span?  I always thought of them as a southernish ontario fish.  I guess the ottawa river isnt southern ontario... or Gbay  hmm
273204,irishfield,2008-11-29 03:42:00,26272,"LOL Dax.... Sounds like it's the family ""get away"" lake is all.. since it's not one of their outpost lakes. A few planes droppin in is all it would take to ruin their fun I'm sure.  As for a swarm of OFC'rs headed to NW Ontario... there's already a bunch up there and ya just never know when the next G2G is and where it just might be held and whom may travel to join in! LOL"
273229,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 08:20:00,612," well we have an air base in Minaki and Kenora and Kenora is right on Lake of the Woods which is one of the top musky destinations.....and that's right up at the top of the province lol....so they are all over Ontario....and Irish if a bunch of OFC'ers were to show up in Irregular and one of the Halley's planes went over it would be considered trespassing.....as far as I know there is no one allowed in there except for people from Halley's Camps at least that is what Chase told me.....either way im not too worried about it....and if you check our site Irregular should show up as one of our fly-in day trips not as an outpost. But anyways thanx for the replies guys and I will pass it on to the Halley's and if anyone has any questions, I can do my best to answer them becuz well....lets face it....I DONT KNOW EVERYTHING lol take care guys!   Hawk"
273230,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 08:21:00,612,oh i almost forgot...Rizzo...would love to have ya up there....always lookin for new and exciting customers....whether it be this year or 5 years down the road.....the Halley's would love to make your fishing trip the best they possibly can! But that goes for anyone.....  Hawk
273234,Rich,2008-11-29 10:10:00,3927,"So.. like, when did you become a guide or a promoter for a resort? Last time we talked about hooking up, you wanted to use live leeches for smallmouth.."
273236,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 10:22:00,612,"im not a promoter....they jus said they need more guests for this coming year so if i knew ppl to suggest it to them......well i figured i would talk about it a bit online and hopefully maybe get sum1 interested....im not making any money off of it.....and live leeches work rich.....thats how i put my numbers up on the bass lake the one day.....chase used lures all day spinners, topwaters, rapalas, twister tails didn't matter what he threw jus could not pick em up....and i found a big reef and drifted a leech over it and BAM and jus kept doing it....i like to figure out a pattern that they will hit on for the day....it's not always a lure bite....but i do use lures if that is what they want lol  anyways, sorry for promoting, jus tryin to give ideas to those who may or may not be interested....  Hawk"
273242,rickster,2008-11-29 13:09:00,495,  pretty sure they don't own the lake don't know how it would be considered trespassing???
273243,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 13:22:00,612,iunno that's jus wat Chaser told me....coulda been messin wit me i can be gullable.....go rent a plane and find it i guess....   Hawk
