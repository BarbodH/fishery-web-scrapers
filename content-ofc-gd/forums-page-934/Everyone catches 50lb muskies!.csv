273830,cram,2008-12-01 02:18:00,1733,That's one rotund monster.   Wow.
273835,cram,2008-12-01 02:25:00,1733,Would love to know what it was caught on etc.
273842,fishingisliving,2008-12-01 02:31:00,170,I am really happy for some reason.....
273845,Rizzo,2008-12-01 02:35:00,4754,"I've never actually weighed a musky so couldn't even begin to guess weights of some of those brutes.  I've heard of many world record bass being caught by cottagers though. Apparently there are 15 pound bass, no even 20's out there waiting to be caught...oops no, the ones I hear about the guy ate the 18 lb bass he caught. Funny thing is, when you tell people the Ontario record is only around 10 pounds, they don't realize they have over-estimated the weight, they think they ate the record!"
273847,Sebastian,2008-12-01 02:39:00,208,That's a godly fish. I wish there were some better pics.
273869,cram,2008-12-01 03:13:00,1733,"Does this maybe deserve its own thread, or is that asking for trouble?"
273872,irishfield,2008-12-01 03:15:00,26272,It is Fil's thread about fish sizes... what's wrong with that Cram.   ..and Tonka-toy fullfilled your wish as well !
273882,pigeonfisher,2008-12-01 03:21:00,696,Tiller?
273891,cram,2008-12-01 03:25:00,1733,\ sorry -- didn't mean to be rude...just thought it might be helpful.
272785,fishindevil,2008-11-27 23:59:00,6254,"A very interseting topic !!!!...i once read a wisconsin D.N.R report about them netting and tagging muskies,and they have big ones in that state,and to acually get a fish that big is like winn ing the lottery !!!they say 48inch muskies are about as big as an average big fish will be,to even get a 50inch fish the odds jump,20 times,and to get a 54inch muskieis like 150,000 to 1  ...man thats incredible,this was after 25yrs of netting and tagging muskies in very productive waters from like 10 different lakes and river systems !!!! they said weight will vary alot more than lenght,as some waters have alot more food than others,and this was all backed by scientific data,and lots of fishermens creel surveys. so it gives you an idea,of how hard it is to get a treu 50 inch fish !!! and to get one over 55inches is just shy of when pigs fly !!!! but it has happened and yes there are true trophys out there,but they say that true monsters get that big because of genetics,and everytime a big fish like that is taken out of the gene pool,that the species will acually never recover as they are so rare,as it is,they said they have proof of that,and that every year the pool is shrunk and that the true monster genes are almost gone !!!! if i can find that article i will post it for sure...."
272786,fishingisliving,2008-11-28 00:02:00,170, Yup! so I guess I'll see ya on saturday then!
272787,Muskieman,2008-11-28 00:05:00,2472,  By Saturday I'll be ice fishing.... It'd be nice to be on soft water in the  boat fishing for Muskies.  
272797,Crazyhook,2008-11-28 00:24:00,1154, haha! just got off the phone with Mike... Saturday will be fun. Hope to get another biggun for this thread
272800,fishingisliving,2008-11-28 00:32:00,170, HAH so did I! good one!  Hope the yamaha starts ;-)
273822,fishingisliving,2008-12-01 02:04:00,170,"alright, here it is... the monster from the St-Lawrence.. 57x33 (is it? you be the judge)  It's the only place I found the report so far.  http://www.muskyhunter.com/forums/generalforum/14542.html  I dont know if its the same the rumours have been about but.. I dont know how many fish of that size have been caught in the st-lawrence this weekend so chances are it is.  Nice fish."
273824,irishfield,2008-12-01 02:08:00,26272,Looks like an incredible fish... with a bad camera angle. Would be great to see a shot of that puppy straight on from the side.
