274023,bbog,2008-12-01 16:18:00,665,The process varies depending on what GPS unit you wish to upload the POI file. Here is a link to Garmin's website that provides free software and the process for their units.  Garmin custom POI loader  Here is another link for a shareware program that speaks to many different devices (warning - I haven't used this one).  POIedit  Good luck.
