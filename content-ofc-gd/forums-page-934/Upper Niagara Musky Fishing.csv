273531,Roy,2008-11-30 08:26:00,13728,It doesn't really matter what the exact size of that fish is. It's just a great fish and anyone who has what it takes to get out there and at least try at this time of the year is to be commended.  Congrats to you and thank you for posting it. I'm sure you'll have better memories than a guy like me who spent most of the day indoors.
273550,Smokey,2008-11-30 13:52:00,1278,Congrats Doug on a nice fish. Nice to see some being caught this year as it's been quiet slow there in the last few years.
