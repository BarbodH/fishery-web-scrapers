They are very slow informing people of holds on the license and giving them a ring just ensures it is continuing through the process."

273779,danc,2008-12-01 00:31:00,4677,"Pretty much just took a head shot of myself, re sized it to the required settings (not much bigger than a postage stamp), printed it and sent it off with my documents."
