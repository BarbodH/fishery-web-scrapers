273892,fishhunter,2008-12-01 03:26:00,604,The Jig bite was on big time on Sat. Not alot over 3lbs but none the less over 80 fish for me and my partner. Best day in a long time. Did not matter what you put down fish attacked all day.
273942,Hawg Hunter,2008-12-01 11:31:00,204,"very glad to hear folks are jigging out there,i have not trolled for walleye in many years and while fishing in the picton area and watching all the boats trolling i often wonder to myself"" do these lads know what there missing""  good post Fishhunter 80 eyes is good too, as you seen its a blood bath on the jigs,normally we hit shore by noon with all nice eaters and 50+ boated.  Hawg Hunter"
273967,Headhunter,2008-12-01 13:42:00,5703,"Well, ya got out, ya made it back, what else could you ask for! LOL Couple of things I spotted in the report! 1. No AC/DC blaring away... bad move 2. You took out FnS without me... bad move!  And btw, Mike the Pike, that was not a red striped pickereye I caught at the gtg... it was a Rainbow Darter on Roids!   LMAO! HH"
274095,JayZ,2008-12-01 19:30:00,18," We were out in the same area this weekend.  Caught all of our fish trolling.  I will say that trolling speeds and depths were pretty important.  We had 2 boats with 3 guys on each boat for the tourney on saturday and between us we had 19 walleye.  Our boat had 8 with the smallest around 9lbs.  We also had the 13.7 winner.  Unfortunately for us, our scale had the walleye at 12.5 lbs (instead of 13.7), so we threw back my 12 lb walleye which would have been around 13 lb on the official scale.  Anyway, great weekend of fishing for sure.  "
274133,fishnsled,2008-12-01 20:36:00,3520,"Nice report Cliff and as always, great to spend some time on the water with you.  You did forget to mention my newing scrapped up tail dancer, but then again, why bother.  I figure a few more trips and we'll have this figured out.  I did have my rod back 200 at one point but perhaps we should have gone back farther or even jigged.  As you said, some info for the memory  banks for the next time, thanks for the tips gentlemen, just a couple of newbies here.   HH - Cliff hasn't installed the radio I gave him so no tunes at all.  lol!  Would have been nice to have you along for the day but not much room in the tinny.  Next year I won't be so quick to put my boat away and you can come along with us.  Couple of beauties there JayZ!  Congrats!  BTW - The test went well today, will more when I follow up with the doc in a couple of weeks."
