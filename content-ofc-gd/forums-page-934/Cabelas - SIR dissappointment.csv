274116,Uncle Buck,2008-12-01 20:03:00,1000,"Ordered an Underwater camera for the upcoming hardwater season...  Went through Cabelas.ca/SIR because it was quite a bit cheaper in price as compared to Cabelas.com  Ordered the Camera on the 13th of Novemeber, recieved the camera on Friday the 28th...  Camera was picked up from Cabelas/SIR on the 26th....  very dissappointing service compared to the US internet orders i've had in the past...  3 to 7 days as specified on the site and it took 15 days to get it..., it took them 2 weeks to even ship it out...  Not impressed with their service  buyer beware if you need something quick"
274118,SlowPoke,2008-12-01 20:09:00,2984,"Hopefully this is an exception and not ""the norm"". Did you make any inquiries or just wait for it to arrive?"
274126,misfish,2008-12-01 20:24:00,29133,"Dont mean to be negative here but,SIR was a great place to buy from,never really heard to many complaints. Cabelas has way less complaints then BPS,from what I read on this board.  But,now they have come up here and taken one of the last great Canadian companies and this is what we get????????  Sure wouldnt put a good taste in my mouth. Hope it works out for the better for you UB."
274131,Handlebarz,2008-12-01 20:35:00,3790,I guess I will stick to the US orders
274139,Whopper,2008-12-01 20:39:00,2174,Goran where was it shipped from? I have had trouble in the past with things getting through customs. I ordered a part for my boat one time and paid extra to have it overnighted and waited two days for it.
274148,ljadug,2008-12-01 20:54:00,11,"You got lucky, my order never been delivered and I just cancelled it after calling them two times... Definitely not Cabelas USA service. Stay away!"
274191,Uncle Buck,2008-12-01 22:48:00,1000,"SHipped from Manitoba... called a  couple of times and they said it was shipped... asked for a manager and they wouldn't give him to me... said to leave my name and number and never got a call back...  as for the camera, it was $159.99 CDN on Cabelas.ca, and 199.99 USD on the US site so worked out under $190 CDN to shipped to the door...  Lucky me, i have an amazing Girlfriend, it was a early christmas gift"
274309,brkygetr,2008-12-02 02:38:00,425,Le Barons??????? Never had a problem. Sometimes they don't have it in stock...but still good service.
