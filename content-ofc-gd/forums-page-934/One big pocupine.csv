273591,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-30 16:33:00,1362,Awesome clip!!!....thanks for sharing that!!
273598,ccmtcanada,2008-11-30 16:46:00,7971,Wow...looks like a baby black bear in parts of that vid!  That thing was huge!
273600,misfish,2008-11-30 16:49:00,29133,Thats what the wife thought too when she seen it.
273620,ozaibak1,2008-11-30 17:22:00,401,"Hmmm are porcupines edible, anyone tried them? Interested to see how they taste."
273633,holdfast,2008-11-30 17:36:00,1813,http://www.survivaltopics.com/survival/tra...pine-in-winter/  They are edible and in a survival situation quite good.  A couple of students on the Survival part of the Advanced Winter-warfare Course caught a Porcupine in a tree and finally got it down ( really funny watching them do it) skinned it and boiled it. It was indeed good.
273655,irishfield,2008-11-30 18:12:00,26272,Can ya turn the radio down bud... I think I heard it say Dadda..
273679,misfish,2008-11-30 20:17:00,29133," I,ll give ya DADDA bud.LOL  I know my cam is crap,but this bye was huge. Probly the biggest I have ever seen. This dude was way out there in the field and even then,he looked large. The vid really doesnt show it,but the poor fella was struggling in the deep snow. The odd time he would break through the crust and stumble. I felt sorry for the poor fella.  Yes, just like rattle snake,they are full of protien and can be eaten raw. This I learned along time ago.Not that I ever want to put that to the test."
273693,Leecher,2008-11-30 21:19:00,7832,Thanks Brian for the report and loved the video.... Cool man BIG so.... Guess plan B did not work too well for ya but there's always plan C Being that you'll give it another try I'm sure Leechman
273697,buckster,2008-11-30 21:46:00,530,Dont feel so bad plan A B and C didn't work for me  yesterday or today.  28 turkeys in a single file about 15 yards from my stand this morning.  Where were they in oct when the season was open?
273701,misfish,2008-11-30 22:11:00,29133,"  Thanks bud I just hope I dont get down to plan Z bud. I got 5 days to sit it out as it,s  the controlled hunt for buck only with shotgun this week.    I was thinking the same thing Buck. No birds, for the first fall hunt here in Ontario/canada,thought it was going to be easy pick,ns as they were always there the years before.. Pop even came down after I told him he would get one. Man they were there again today. CLUCK CLUCK this   . Guess they were ticked off I took thier two boyfriends in the spring.LOL"
273755,OhioFisherman,2008-11-30 23:50:00,6623,Great! Never seen one in the wild.
273759,douG,2008-12-01 00:02:00,2693,"That is one big porkie, Brian."
273766,danc,2008-12-01 00:10:00,4677,Pfffftttt.... That's just a baby Brian. The porcupines up here as a big as a Horse. And their quills are at least two feet long. They can kill ya with one swipe of the tail.
273769,holdfast,2008-12-01 00:15:00,1813,Are they as Dangerous as the Snow Snakes
273828,Leecher,2008-12-01 02:13:00,7832, Shotgun..... should be a breeze  and plan C..... Go get'em bud Good luck to ya
273895,mukluk,2008-12-01 03:31:00,196,In Thunder Bay; I hear the 'porky's even hijack the salt trucks!
273912,ehg,2008-12-01 03:58:00,2666,Always thought they were the size of a raccoon. Saw my first one this year near a road. It was actually quite large!
