273862,Mattones,2008-12-01 03:06:00,587,Just drove home from Flambrough. 30- 40km the entire way and still felt the car slipping. This guy in a SUV passed me and about 2 miles down the road it was in a ditch. I got out and asked if he was alright and was flipped off.  Some people.
273866,Leecher,2008-12-01 03:10:00,7832,Here in the Outaouais suppose to get 10-15cm of snow.   Lots of wind right now and flakes coming down

I did OK in my old Aerostar with just all season tires, but I'm careful and use the gas pedal very gingerly. I passed 2 cars in the ditch and saw one spin out coming in the other direction.  You just have to take it easy, slow down, be cautious, think and look ahead.  The   who gave you the bird deserves   what he got. You should have been pointing your finger at him and laughed."
