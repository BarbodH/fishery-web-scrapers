I purchased an Xbox 360, and now im having problems with the system, go figure? REALLY? Ive pin-pointed the issue down to the disc drive, getting unplayable disc and grinding noises, i tried cleaning it and adjusting the magnet, im thinking the magnet or something else is not griping the cd enough, im basically looking to buy a new one for less then 50 bux, if anyone knows someone who may have them and is selling for cheap, pls, pls gimme a PM,  Good Day...  ps. the model is the 3120L Hitachi 59DJ, manufactored June 2006"
274132,highdrifter,2008-12-01 20:35:00,2534,"Sounds like it needs to be serviced...  Have you been leaving on while you sneak out to the harbour?!  Overheating tends to be a problem with newer gaming systems..  Your processor may have suffered a little.  If it's under a year old my guess is it's still under warranty.  Send it in and they'll fix it free of charge.  While it's in the shop, get out there and fish!  cheers HD"
274134,purekgw,2008-12-01 20:36:00,585,ushaly u can just take it back to where you bout it ares did  that and we just took it back how long ago u buy it?  And 360s have 3 year warranty's
274136,highdrifter,2008-12-01 20:37:00,2534, Just noticed that...  Hitachi??!!  Send it in mang.  good luck!
274140,mistyjr1,2008-12-01 20:39:00,97,Do your cds have red rings on them??
274141,urbanangler1990,2008-12-01 20:41:00,933,"i bought it off a guy who bought a lot of them and is selling individually, although the system was working fine for the first week! thats when it decided to take a crap on me, the warranty expired about a year ago, so thats that"
274142,urbanangler1990,2008-12-01 20:43:00,933,"  If u mean the red ring of death thing, then no my system doesnt have RROD"
274144,purekgw,2008-12-01 20:46:00,585,try and find some one who sent there xbox in because xbox sends back the broken one i had one sitting here for a month then i threw it out
274146,PatrickGG,2008-12-01 20:51:00,562,Ditch the console Buy a P.C gaming Rig   ..
274147,young_one,2008-12-01 20:52:00,620,"try pacfic mall, they might be able to fix your disc drive. Ive seen them fixing PSP, NDS, they probably can fix it, and maybe under $50 Did you know with the new Xbox interface upgrade, you can copy games to hardrive? I've copied all my favorite games on to the harddrive(elite 120G) and playing of the hard drive is much faster, spares my disc drive and less noisy. (but u do need the initial copy of the game from disc)"
274152,highdrifter,2008-12-01 21:02:00,2534, Pacific Mall... LOL  Best spot to Mod your console.  Oops did I say that out loud??!
274180,forrest,2008-12-01 22:16:00,1032,"  3 years for the red rings of death only, thats the way I read it: http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox...antyUpdate.aspx"
