273483,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-30 02:15:00,2038,"Well guys the plan was to hopefully hook into a Muskie  The day started off like this    Had to get some '' Extra '' Muskie gear for this outing    A hour later we arrive at the launch      We hit the water and said a little for prayer for our safety and for a Muskie    If we weren't dodging ice flows we were dodging geese          Six hours later ,, no action    You know to call it a day  when you see your partner in LA LA LAND      Hope ya enjoyed this fishless report"
273489,ccmtcanada,2008-11-30 02:19:00,7971,Now that's going to extremes to fish!  Great report...sometimes you just get skunked out there.  I was on BOQ for 6 hours today with the same result...only less snow on the ramp...LOL.
273491,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-30 02:20:00,1362,Hey Paul...it was nice seeing you and Kevin today...thanks for dropping by...I'm thinking bout giving her a try tomorrow morning....I'll see what the weather's like when i get up..
273493,Terry,2008-11-30 02:24:00,14456,wow you guys are die hard
273511,Leecher,2008-11-30 03:42:00,7832,"Diehard, that's an understatement..... OMG I can't believe you guys launched anyways on that ramp     Crazy.... look at the amount of snow  Saw your boat in front of the house this morning and was wondering why you were bringing the extra gear...... Now I know why Nice pics of the geese, they sure were in great numbers  On the last pic, looks like Kevin's enjoying the ride  So Paul.... are you winterizing the Pricencraft?? Thanks for the report..... and kudos to both of you for going out and trying your best Jacques"
273546,Pigeontroller,2008-11-30 13:39:00,2793,You're a brave man using a launch like that with a Sunfire!
273549,Smokey,2008-11-30 13:51:00,1278,Looks like you put a great effort into the day. Congrats on doing it and Thanks for the pics and report.
273580,corvette1,2008-11-30 15:49:00,1765,good job guys dont let a little snow scare you away
273716,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-30 22:45:00,2038,"  Took care of that this afternoon Jacques , It got the full treatment from bow to stern and then some,, now i'm just taking a break from sitting in it and reflecting on what a great softwater its been , It was an awesome year, many fish were caught between the both of us .    It won't be long now ...... ICE"
273719,fishindevil,2008-11-30 22:51:00,6254,"Well at least now we know you are hardcore for muskies !!!!!.  ...too bad bout the skunk,but hey it was your last trip of ther year,still better than the couch !!!  lol..lol.  cheers"
273739,Mike the Pike,2008-11-30 23:31:00,3421, Yes it took balls to launch with a front wheel drive in those conditions but it looks like Paul had the snowtires on.  Well hopefully I can hook up with you Jacques and Steve this winter on the ice.  Nice boat you got there Paul thanks for the shots of the geese.  Now lets hope it gets cold we need to go ice fishing.   MTP
273740,limeyangler,2008-11-30 23:33:00,5204,Thats a grerat fishless report guys...die hard is an understatement..  lol....i cant believe you mananged to launch that boat with just a car in all that snow...CONGRATS...just for that.   Great pictures too
273748,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-30 23:40:00,1362, You can count on that Mike!!!...I'd say that there's a hardwater McBay adventure coming soon...oh..and you forgot about Kevin (aka Fishing 24/7)....he's part of the 4 amigos
273789,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-01 00:52:00,2038,"  Sounds like a plan Mike , We have many great spots to to ice fish , but McLaurin Bay is top of the list    See ya soon ..............."
273799,GoneFishin,2008-12-01 01:18:00,349,"That is one scary looking boat ramp! To bad you guys weren't rewarded with some fish. I've also got a quick question for you lol, hows that sunfire handle the boat? ever had any problems getting your boat back out of the lake? I am going to buy a 12ft boat for next year and thought I would need a 4x4 truck but with gas prices lately I would rather be able to pull it in a little car."
273819,Leecher,2008-12-01 01:55:00,7832, Good to know that it got the full treatment.... now it can rest in peace until next soft water season  It was an amazing season Paul and I thank you from the bottom of my heart Lots of fish caught and good times  Now bring on the ice and lets rock on
273832,Leecher,2008-12-01 02:20:00,7832, Mike will be waiting for you and McBay is the one of the first spot will be targetting for sure  Let us know when you are coming down
273858,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-01 02:58:00,2038,"  Amazingly it pulls the boat pretty good ,, on the hills I drop it down a gear to get more rpm out of the 4 banger. (Automatic trans)  As far as pulling it out of the water ,, no problem whatsoever"
