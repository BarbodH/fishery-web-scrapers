273783,pike slayer,2008-12-01 00:38:00,1177,"i heard this past fall a guy shot one up in the aubery falls area that was 150lb. such an awesome animal, they should never be bothered unless they attack you."
273800,Clampet,2008-12-01 01:20:00,1947,"Not according to this.. <h2 align=""left"">Characteristics and Physical Features of the     Lynx</h2>  <h4 align=""left"">Identification:</h4> Height: Most adult lynx are 30 to 42 in. (74 to 107 cm.) long. Weight: Most adult lynx weigh from 18 to 30 pounds     (8.2-13.6 kg.). Male lynx are generally larger then females and occasionally weigh 40     pounds (18.2 kg.) or more.  "
273804,irishfield,2008-12-01 01:26:00,26272,"150 lbs would be a BIG lynx... but I can tell you Jed...this one was more than 30 lbs... I'd say 40 to 50...and we saw it right up close.. too close.,,and a few times after this as well. That said... I can see this going the way of the Wolf ! LMAO    "

273945,paulyboy83,2008-12-01 11:59:00,54, My uncle says they are quite tasty.  He had one in his freezer last fall.  Not too sure I would go out of my way to eat one but may try it if it were offered to me.
274040,kemper,2008-12-01 17:33:00,2232,  uh...   are you allowed to...eat those things?
274042,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-01 17:35:00,10439,  Don't see why not if you're allowed to hunt and trap them.
274045,kemper,2008-12-01 17:42:00,2232,"  Thanks, I actually wasnt aware that you were still allowed to do that either. I kinda assumed that an animal like the Lynx would be protected  Had one sneak up on me late at night once in the snow, didnt make a sound and scared the life out of me when I turned around to see it ten feet behind me."
