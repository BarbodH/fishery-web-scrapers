I just plain see RED when some hunters and fisherman throw their brothers under the bus just cause they don't enjoy the same aspects of the sport as they do  Meat hunters throw trophy hunters under the bus. Proponents of catch and release have a hissy fit if some one keeps a fish. Flyfisherman somehow think they are the elite and bait fisherman are neanderthals. Hunters throw guys who like shooting non hunting style firearms under the bus. Some steelheaders would like to ban roe The list goes on but you get the idea  Divide and conquer is how the anti's are going to get both hunting and fishing banned or severely restricted in the future.  It is true, both in Germany and Switzerland , 2 countries I don't associate with the lunatic fringe , have both banned catch and release fishing as inhumane and barbaric, right up there with noodle, dog  and bull fighting."

I don't target predators as I won't eat them but have shot a coyote at close range in turkey season when he showed he wasn't afraid of me and wouldn't take off.  I also let go a number of coyotes and didn't shoot when they took off immediately when they made me.  I like dogs and for a long time didn't want to shoot a coyote as it looks like a dog even though I know it's competeing with me for the same game.  All were personal ethics as killing them on a small game license is legal."

I would shoot the Coyotes because they drive the Deer, and rabbit out and thats what I hunt. So the less that are on my property the better IMO.

A mature bull followed our call to the edge of the bush we were in and just before he was in bow range 2 wolves started after him. He ran past us with them in pursuit for about 30 yards before they gave up knowing it was a healthy animal and they wouldn't catch him. This year we only heard them once... although they are tough on moose calves I like hearing and seeing them. Killing a few won't hurt the population but I don't condone a random slaughter...

I am not a hunter but dont dis agree with hunting as a means of proving meat for your family, with all the CRAP they put in our food its nice to know you are eating free range, probably no steriods added.  The deer/meat prob had a good life roaming the forrests, eating organic lol and making babies!  These people are talking about ""killing all of them"" and that these vermit are destroying all my livestock....$10 bucks says not 1 of them own a farm, or livestock.  Do you even want to eat wolf meat?"
881970,luclarochelle,2014-11-20 20:32:00,37,I wouldnt want to eat wolf meat personally... just doesnt seem right
881975,Beavertail,2014-11-20 20:56:00,331,Most guys that shoot wolves/coyotes do it for sport and possibly the pelts...'predator hunting' they call it. Don't know anyone who has tried eating either though.

We for the most part have the same love and respect of wildlife and honor our hunted by being humane and eating our kills. Anyone who does other than that is look at with scorn in my eyes.   Art
