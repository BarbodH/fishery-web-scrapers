882671,Shloim,2014-11-24 00:58:00,515,Finally put the boat away for the season and while winterizing I noticed a new clicking noise when lowering the motor. Anyone know what that means? Aside form more money?
882673,Fisherman,2014-11-24 01:01:00,7201,Boat  = Break Out Another Thousand.  Maybe just the relays clicking.
882717,mike rousseau,2014-11-24 13:34:00,4661,I agree  Make sure you firmly pressing the button for the trim...  When it clicks does the motor hesitate lowering?
882722,Shloim,2014-11-24 14:28:00,515,Nope the trim works fine and the clicking seems to be coming from the other part/cylinder beside the one with the rod coming out of it. It's kind of bullet shaped
882732,Entropy,2014-11-24 15:37:00,747,perhaps a bit of air in the system?
882737,Shloim,2014-11-24 16:08:00,515,"It worked perfectly 2 weeks ago and I didn't use since, it was cold out I wonder if that makes a difference..."
