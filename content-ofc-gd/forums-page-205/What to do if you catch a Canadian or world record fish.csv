881903,MrSimon,2014-11-20 15:38:00,217,"If I catch it somewhere close to a certification scale and proper freezer .... I'd keep it and have it certified and then mounted.  If I'm at an outpost or fly-in, I'd take pics and video and let it go .... wouldn't have the ice or cooler to transport it back."
881926,lew,2014-11-20 17:01:00,12766,I have zero interest in killing anything so any record fish I caught would be heading back into the water.
881933,manitoubass2,2014-11-20 17:22:00,11391,I will never catch a record fish so I dont really worry about it lol.  now that I said that Ill probably catch a hyyyuge muskie fishing crappie on LOTWs lol  and no chance at walleye. over the past 5 years of chasing I seem to catch every 12 lber in the lake. I cant even beat my pb never mind a record haha
881960,Gregoire,2014-11-20 19:44:00,1397,"I'll chime in again, as I have an opinion about the amount of money an angler could make on a record musky. Don't quit your day job is the best advice I think that has been given. As was already pointed out, a professional angler would stand to cash in, as they probably already have incentives in their contracts that would kick in, and they would get a large amount of publicity. If you are a professional angler and do not bonk a record, then you are making a poor career choice. If you are an amateur angler and you catch a large fish, and publicize it, then you are opening yourself up to a lot of negative kick back. If you keep it, you could potentially make some money off of it, maybe 6 figures or so, but not millions. For me, and in my mind any reasonable person, millions would be what it would take to cash in on a fish. Even to get the sponsors, and other revenue, you would have to change your lifestyle, travelling around to shows and such, that you would have the be pretty unhappy with your life to make it worth while. The other factor is that when you make fishing a profession, it ceases to become a hobby, that usually means that fishing for fun is no longer an option. I know a professional musky fisherman who only fishes when he is getting paid, and although he seems to still enjoy it, especially catching big fish, there seems to be something lost there.  For me fishing, especially musky fishing, is one of the few things that I do where I feel a sense of release and exhilaration. I get something from it that I cannot get anywhere else. That is why I do it. I do not want that to change, that is why if I ever catch a record I will take a pic and a measurement, and let it go."
881963,Freshtrax,2014-11-20 20:01:00,2215,I'd bonk any record and it be on the wall in my man cave.   Wouldn't feel the least bit guilty.
882104,singingdog,2014-11-21 11:10:00,1047,"Interesting question. I think that the internet has drastically changed how a world-record fish catching angler would be treated. IF they were specifically targeting large fish of a desirable species (bass, trout, walleye, musky), and had a compelling story to tell, then I think the benefits would be big and long lasting (IF the angler wanted to live that kind of life). An angler that had worked on developing the knowledge and techniques to specifically catch large fish would have a lot to share, and consequently benefit from.  IF they caught it ""incidentally""  (after targetting musky for the past couple of years, I am convinced I will catch my first really big 'ski on a 4"" tube while bass fishing), then I think that the benefits would be far less: the story would be far less compelling. ""Yea, I was trolling a crawler harness when ""wham"" my rod bends right over"". Each species has it's ""tribe"" of big fish chasers who are not easily impressed by an incidental big fish catch. I think that the industry knows that and would respond accordingly."
882121,bigugli,2014-11-21 13:42:00,6138,Getting a record book fish has been on the bucket list since I was a teenager. I'd gladly bonk it and jump through the hoops
881279,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-17 19:36:00,956,"Hi guys.  Just wondering if I or someone I know catches that big fish.  I know its a long shot, but not too sure what the process would be.  I'm thinking take a picture of its length and girth and send that out to the ministry.  I'm hoping that you don't need the actually fish cause I'm strictly catch and release and if I land a 70"" muskie its going back into the water.  Thanks"
881281,outllaw,2014-11-17 19:47:00,1232,woohoo. no record unless its bonked. sorry but that's the real world. and then only half the world will believe it.
881285,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-17 20:02:00,956,Wow that's sucks
881291,BillM,2014-11-17 20:26:00,17367,You can always go for a live release record.
881301,sauce,2014-11-17 21:36:00,219,"Just feel good knowing that it really was as big as you say it was. Whether you decide to keep it or let it go depends on how badly you want to get it certified. With musky in particular, keeping extremely large fish doesn't sit well with a lot of folks. Most other species don't seem to get as much attention in this regard."
881344,Steve,2014-11-18 00:11:00,2075,"of all the species, musky would be the one I'd love to see fall....  cause there isn't a more contested record than the muskie one...  what would larry ramsall do with his time if a record muskie was caught, lol."
881427,Gregoire,2014-11-18 14:55:00,1397,"If you fish for records, and the ""glory"" associated with the record, you bonk the fish. The only real way to know. Those live release records that are highly publicized, were not record fish otherwise they would have been bonked. There is more publicity with a huge live release record and a speculated weight, than a huge fish that is killed and weighs 55#. If you fish for other reasons, measure the fish, take a pic, and share it with your friends. It happened recently and was the best way to handle it in my opinion."
881430,BillM,2014-11-18 15:05:00,17367,"Oh if I caught a 70lb, 70in musky, you can bet your ass it wouldn't be going back..  That fish is worth a lot of $$$$."
881431,John Bacon,2014-11-18 15:06:00,3277,"The extra publicity for a live released fish is due to all the people arguing over whether the fish was really as big as claimed.  To the OP:  The fish would also have to be weighed (and witnessed) on a certified scale.  I am sure the ministry would be interested in the catch, but they do not maintain world records."
881432,John Bacon,2014-11-18 15:09:00,3277,"Oh if I caught a 70lb, 70in musky, you can bet your ass it wouldn't be going back..  That fish is worth a lot of $$$$.  That depends on your definition of a lot.  I don't think you would be able to quite your day job based on the proceeds from a world record muskie."
881433,BillM,2014-11-18 15:10:00,17367," That depends on your definition of a lot.  I don't think you would be able to quite your day job based on the proceeds from a world record muskie.  Of course not, that would be a silly assumption by anyone."
881820,moxie,2014-11-20 02:09:00,1566,"70lb, 70"" musky and your name would probably be tied to that  Ad infinitum."
881822,irishfield,2014-11-20 02:18:00,26272,"Why I use to like my Conservation licence and the easy answer to CO Bruce Ward's question of ""what would you do if you caught a record muskie""... I'd have no choice but to let it go ! But because of the dick and his thoughts of ""possession"".. I upgraded to a Sport so I can kill the bugger!.. no I'd still let it go!"
881823,manitoubass2,2014-11-20 02:22:00,11391,"if I caught a 70"" musky you all would have a pic on here before I even took one"
881824,chris.brock,2014-11-20 02:46:00,4053,"I definitely wouldn't feel good about it but I think I would have to bonk it  20 plus years ago, there was a tackle store in Guelph (not Ray's Hook, Line, Sinker) on Edinborough near the Beer Store. The brothers who owned it like to fish for muskie. I remember the guy telling me in detail, how he could retire off the world record muskie. Deals with tackle companies whose equipment he allegedly used to catch the fish, trade shows, even selling individual scales off the fish to collectors (I think illegal now).  It's sad but true, without the actual specimen, it's just a fish story  that's one of the reasons I buy a sportsman licence"
881825,solopaddler,2014-11-20 02:51:00,8605,I would have no qualms whatsoever keeping a world record fish of any species.
881826,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-20 02:55:00,10439,I actually caught a fish that would have been an all tackle world record in the early 80's. I snapped a pic and let it go.
881827,manitoubass2,2014-11-20 02:55:00,11391,"your a horrible person mike.  huge difference in a minnow to a 17"" walleye to a 70"" muskie.  same with a 8 point buck or a 12 point buck.  lol  id keep it as well"

881836,leaf4,2014-11-20 03:35:00,2466,"Tough call, being a weekend fisherman and not having a whole lot to gain from it (I think?) I'd probably release it, with extensive pics and documentation of course so if someone called Bull I could shut them up haha"

881870,Moosebunk,2014-11-20 14:00:00,3970,"""Probably"" bonk it.  Wouldn't matter what really.  Even though, through IGFA to make any such claim of WWR fish you'd likely have to jump through some hoops.  Caught a good many past and present record breaking longnose gar though and haven't killed one yet, but only because I've seen at least four, maybe a half dozen bigger than my biggest.  Caught a sheephead exceeding the current record, but was also in the boat with Aaron the day he caught and released his 27.5lb'er, and that in my mind is the biggest Ontario Record sheepie.  And over the years in Moose Factory, there have been a number of fallfish which would have smashed the current record.  But these species mean little to the angling world, and besides the gar, when that Ontario record 25+ is caught I might take my first one, even despite the WWR being around 50 or more pounds.  It's the bass, walleye, muskie and maybe even a number of the trout (possibly pike) which are the one's to beat for any sort of glory in the books and padding in the pocket.  The muskie, speck or laker would be my preference."
881881,MCTFisher9120,2014-11-20 14:35:00,3761,"I love my camera and would do these things if I caught a record Largemouth or Smallmouth bass. I would get the fish in the live well. Get 4 or 5 perfect normal photo's with the fish. Then I would do both take pictures of length/girth measurements and weigh the fish with a digital scale. I would keep clear photo's of measurements and weight as well as getting somebody to film it. With a good livewell i'm sure the fish would be fine.  After measurments and weight it comes down to certified weight and the record. I know you can't transport live fish so you would have to transport the fish dead to a local grocery store somewhere where you can get a meat scale (certified in the last year).  Personally, photo's and video would be enough for me. A 10lb+Largemouth or 9lb+Smallmouth up here would be remarkable. After documentation and providing the fish is in good healthI would turn it back no mount or anything. My near 7lb Largemouth I did the same thing, photo's/video and release. I since then have setup a replica mount to be done by Advanced.  It would be a dreamy day, I would take a record bass over a small lottery winning any day"
