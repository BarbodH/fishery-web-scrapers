881787,huzzsaba,2014-11-19 23:49:00,884,Wondering how the fishing is in Wheatley PP specifically Boosey Creek and Sugar Creek within the park.  Same for the Ausable channel in Pinery PP?  These are two spots I plan to go camping next summer and hoping to get some fishing done within the park as well as a beach to enjoy.  Thanks

I went fishing once or twice at the pinery this time of year. Bring a small boat with a trolling motor to cover as much of the river as possible and you'll have a blast."

Below the dam the river holds pike,bass,perch,crappie,carp and dogfish. Fish the weed pockets in this area either from shore or canoe,there is also a bridge  heading towards the Burly area then can be good."
