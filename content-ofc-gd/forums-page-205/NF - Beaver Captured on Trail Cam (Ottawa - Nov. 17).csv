Approximately 50 yards inland, a beaver had been busy cutting down trees and dragging them to the water.I decided to set up my trail camera on Monday in hopes of catching him in the act. That night I filmed him eating tree bark, preening, and rubbing his belly like their was no tomorrow.  The following night the marsh was frozen solid, so this will be the last I will see of him this year.  I also captured a fisher quickly grabbing a drink, just two hours before the beaver appeared!  (watch in 1080p HD for best quality)        Cheers,  Justin"

I seen this long black thing swimming towards me,but got the camera out way to late.      I was surprised to hear there have been a few deaths from beaver attacks. Apparently,if you are very close to them and taking a pic,they will leap and grab a hold of your leg,causing extensive bleeding . The  persons blead to death.  http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/05/29/beavers_kill_man_trying_to_pose_for_photo.html"

I watched an otter and beaver fight on the side of a hill I was on. to this day the screams I heard freak me out.. natures simply amazing and you folks film an show us. thank you again
882018,JustinHoffman,2014-11-20 22:49:00,482,"Brian B. - Great footage. I have been fishing in late evening when one of these guys 'slaps' their tail! Certainly can give you a fright!! lol  Very cool, Matt. Surprised it wasn't a bit more aggressive to you. Still, probably not a good idea to pet one  And thanks for all of the other kind comments. Being out in nature and recording it, either with camera or trail cam, is definitely a passion. Always happy to share...  Cheers,  Justin"
