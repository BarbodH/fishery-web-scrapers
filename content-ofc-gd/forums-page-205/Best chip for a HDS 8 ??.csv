880659,Terry,2014-11-13 23:59:00,14456,there is no best chip for a unit  there are best chips for areas or certain lakes  where are you going to use it
880661,Bondar,2014-11-14 00:07:00,817,"Erie mostly , niagara region, maybe a couple trips to st.clair"
880669,Terry,2014-11-14 00:37:00,14456,check this video  this guy is the best in ontario  watch video  7  about cards start about half way through      then  watch 8   
880961,G.mech,2014-11-15 20:21:00,830,"Navionics + is the best deal really, you choose whatever lakes you want and download the freshest data available with 1 foot contours.  The video doesn't mention is because it wasn't out when it was made.  It saves buying multiple cards in many cases.  Also, some retailers have been telling people that they have issues with Navionics+ but the truth is that they have a whole bunch of Platinum and hotmaps cards in stock that they don't want to get stuck with.....I won't mention any names but it's a crock."

881037,porkpie,2014-11-16 13:44:00,2521,You should meet him in person then.  Similar god complex as to what most paramedics have LOL.
881056,Loonietoon,2014-11-16 17:01:00,1450,"You go in and buy one from him and he will set it all up for you and if you don;t know anything about them he will even teach you how to use it, try that any where else... Joslyn knows his stuff sometimes better than the Sales people them self"
881841,AdamS,2014-11-20 04:22:00,161,"I agree with G.mech I opted for navionics + and I like it so far. just choose what you want, download, and enjoy."
