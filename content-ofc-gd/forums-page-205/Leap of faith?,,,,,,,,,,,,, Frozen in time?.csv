882589,Moosebunk,2014-11-23 16:50:00,3970,Those Live Target frogs are expensive Brian.  Better get to chipping it out.  That frog is probably a little too cold blooded about now.
882601,Entropy,2014-11-23 18:07:00,747,"I have seen this before, for some species of frog, when they thaw out, they hop away.  Very cool to watch.  Saw one do this during an ice storm a couple of years back."

882612,John,2014-11-23 19:25:00,2956,Some species of frogs can survive being frozen and thawed. They stop breathing and their hearts stop beating and they need zero oxygen. Before the rest of their organs shut down they surround themselves in some sort of protective glucose like substance. When they thaw the body starts a repair and rebuilding process. And that's all I remember from senior year biology class....

882617,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-23 20:04:00,2582,Nice shot Brian. Totally unrelated but the frog in the ice reminded me of a rare thing I saw a few years back chasing chrome in March. A huge snapping turtle crawled out of Oshawa creek and plucked down on a big chunk of blown out ice right beside my buddy and I. It was a bright sunny day so I figure  it was just trying to get out of the freezing cold water and warm  up. Epic fail however running out of gas on a block of ice
