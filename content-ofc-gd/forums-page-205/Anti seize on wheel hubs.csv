882491,lew,2014-11-22 23:24:00,12766,"Once your rims are 15 years old Lew ,you will lose some air over a month .  Shouldn't be a problem then davey, I buy a new truck every 3-4 years"
882492,Bernie,2014-11-22 23:25:00,3190,"Ha, then you would need a balancer Wayne."
882493,irishfield,2014-11-22 23:26:00,26272,Yah... tools eh..
882494,Bernie,2014-11-22 23:27:00,3190,Never ends Wayne.
882496,Canuck2fan,2014-11-22 23:43:00,1444,"For sure Davey... I already have one that leaks down on my '11. Leah's old '03 is a weekly affair for two wheels. Aluminum and road brine do not play well together.  The stuff they put on the roads here now eats any metal a lot quicker than it used to. Put on new drums and just go a winter and they look 10yrs old.  My dad has been a mechanic for 60yrs and says he hasn't seen anything like it. They have to go back and verify the maintenance records, and part purchase dates, just because they can't believe how fast things are wearing out, on the cabs, airport vans and limos."
882497,irishfield,2014-11-22 23:51:00,26272,Part of it is cheap recycled steel... but the road brine is playing a big part in eating brake lines and other important stuff. I think it's all a conspiracy to help fund windshield washer supply companies myself... lol.. you can't even clear a windshield by drafting someone anymore!
882498,Mister G,2014-11-23 00:01:00,1429,Besides aluminum wheels always having rim leeks this is just another reason not to have on any of my vehicles.;  Changed out brake pads and rotors on the wife's car about 2 weeks ago and of course them damn rotors were rusted on.......about 25-50 hits with a 2.5 lb  ball peen hammer and off them came. The vibration alone will eventually give way.
882500,irishfield,2014-11-23 00:04:00,26272,You removed the thin lock nut and brake caliper first...
882501,Bernie,2014-11-23 00:06:00,3190,"Yep, and all the time you are whacking on those old rotors getting them off, where do you think that force is being transferred to?O ya, those wheel bearings. Keep an ear on them, most likely been marked on the rollers or races and will be making noise soon."
882505,Canuck2fan,2014-11-23 00:40:00,1444,"Yep, and all the time you are whacking on those old rotors getting them off, where do you think that force is being transferred to? O ya, those wheel bearings. Keep an ear on them, most likely been marked on the rollers or races and will be making noise soon.  Yeah then don't even get me started on changing out wheel hub assemblies lately. What used to be a relatively simple and quick job to replace inner and outer bearings. With hub assemblies it has become a 4 hr to 5 hr grudge match using brute force, and 7 or 8 McGyvered tools that never seem to quite get it done.  Not too mention the last 3 I helped dad with did not have anything underneath the vehicle close enough or strong enough so we could use to put a rod against to get the power steering to help pop em out.  What is even sadder the labour board, and insurance rep insist that having a oxyacetylene torch is not going to happen at that shop, because of the propane dispensing tank on the property, along with the 10 vehicles running on it parked in the shop at any given time LOL I even offered to by the torch kit just to make things easier on dad, all the owner had to do was supply the gas. NOPE you aren't allowed and this a free country LOL."
882506,Mister G,2014-11-23 00:43:00,1429,"Time has proven over the many years this method of many small whacks on the rusted rotors have been effected without ill effects.  But I'll take the advice given and keep a ear to the grindstone. Thanks  BTW no thin lock nut, but here was 2 Philip screws that need to be removed.....guess that vehicle has them ? ? ?"
882507,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-23 00:45:00,956,I had a problem taking my tire off one time until my dad used a rubber mallet.  I always keep one in my car just in case now.

882509,Bernie,2014-11-23 00:54:00,3190,A Snap-On air hammer is the greatest tool for shaking rusted parts loose.Much easier than swinging a hammer.
882510,irishfield,2014-11-23 00:55:00,26272,I find the easiest way to remove the rotor is to just bring the hub along for the ride!
882511,Bernie,2014-11-23 00:58:00,3190,"Ha!Yep, sometimes it's best to do it all at once Wayne!"
882512,irishfield,2014-11-23 01:02:00,26272,Thank God it was 2 wheel drive with front mount (and not rear mount) calipers or I'd probably be shy a daughter in law ! Only thing retaining the wheel was the caliper frame.
882513,Bernie,2014-11-23 01:05:00,3190,Seen that happen on many occasions.Not likely ever see a recall though. They would have to recall 98% of the vehicles made in the last 20 years. In my opinion this design should be outlawed.
882514,irishfield,2014-11-23 01:08:00,26272,"Yep.. I've said it to you before Bernie.... no safety retention, simply held in by the balls (when they are still present) and two bearings an inch apart expected to take the torque. Take us back to the spindle and taper bearings soon please..."
882515,Canuck2fan,2014-11-23 01:30:00,1444,"I find the easiest way to remove the rotor is to just bring the hub along for the ride!  Irishfield, I might be wrong but that I am willing to bet that method isn't found in the service manual LOL. Almost as good as the split hub on my cousins 2003 Ram that he then drove for 30 miles... It was fun getting out the other half out of the spindle.  Bernie the last one was over an 1 hr on the air chisel and that was after we had to leave and come back after the office closed because the gal in there couldn't hear on the phone to take reservations LOL. I tried to explain to her that even with ear protection I couldn't hear myself think after 5 minutes.  I do NOT understand why they don't come up with a brake shield made of something that will stop the metals welding together like they do, instead of adding a third alloy into the mix.... OH wait that would make sense not dollars LOL. "
882521,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-23 02:24:00,10439,I replaced the front unit bearings on my Honda Pilot last winter. Man what an awful job that was. The bearing is pressed into the steering knuckle and then the hub is pressed into the bearing. Had a local shop press the bearings and they even had a heck of a time with it. GM's are way easier. Did the ball joints @ the same time so I wouldn't have to pull things apart again.
882335,lew,2014-11-22 12:13:00,12766,I made a recent post about changing flat tires and now I have a question.  I put my winter tires on last week and had a bit of trouble getting one of the summer wheels off presumably because of a bit of corrosion between the aluminum wheel and steel hub. Took me a few minutes with a bit of persuasion but wasn't a big deal in the garage but could be an issue on the side of the road with limited tools.  Never had this issue before but I'm thinking a bit of anti seize or good grease between the 2 surfaces would eliminate the problem.  What do you guys use ??  And FWIW I torque my wheels to the proper setting.
882339,Bernie,2014-11-22 12:26:00,3190,"Good morning Lew.What has happened to you is a very common issue. Glad you were able to get the wheel off without a whole lot of difficulty.Generally I clean the rust off of the hub and then apply some thick grease or anti seize to help prevent further corrosion.They say not to apply any lube to the studs either, but I do anyway. I believe that the rust on the studs when retorquing is more of an issue than the lube."
882340,lew,2014-11-22 12:31:00,12766,"Thanks Bernie, I'll take your advice and apply some anti seize. As mentioned I've never had a problem before and it would be a real issue if it happened on the hiway."
882343,Fisherman,2014-11-22 13:00:00,7201,Anti seize = anti hammer.
882344,lew,2014-11-22 13:04:00,12766,Anti seize = anti hammer.  And alot less work & possible wheel damage too.
882347,outllaw,2014-11-22 13:21:00,1232,grease the rim at contact to hub lew. I know exactly what yer saying. aluminum rims suck in my opinion anyhow. to me the leak and are not durable as good old steel.....excellent point lew . most never notice
882348,lew,2014-11-22 13:31:00,12766,"Will do George, thanks."
882358,BillM,2014-11-22 14:36:00,17367,"Lew the next time they're off take a wire wheel + drill to the hub face to get all the rust off.  I put a light coating of anti-seize on the hub face anytime I'm swapping from summers > winters.  I usually don't have problems getting them off come spring time, but if I do a 2x4 and a sledge (light taps) makes quick work of it."
882361,Sinker,2014-11-22 14:39:00,8692,"I had a guy come in to my work with a brand new F150. He parked the truck, and went for a hike with his family. When they came back his tire was flat. I noticed him trying to get it off, so offered some help. That tire would not come off that truck. We tried everything from a 12lb sledge hammer, to a bottle jack against the frame!!! We eventually just put a plug in the tire and got him going, but my lord we worked hard trying to get it off!  Glad yours wasnt the same Lew, and if it was my truck i'd be doing something about it too.  S."
882363,lew,2014-11-22 14:47:00,12766,"I've got the anti seize and will be removing the 4 winter tires in an hour, cleaning everything up and applying the lubricant. As said above, I've never had any major problems ever getting a wheel off but if it happened with a flat on the highway it wouldn't be too much fun.  When I had the one stick on me last week I had to put an 8' 4x4 on the inside of the wheel and hit it with a sledge to get the darned thing off."
882368,Bernie,2014-11-22 14:53:00,3190,Have had to back wheel nuts a couple threads then drive the vehicle in the parking lot making turns until the wheel lets go.Steel rims you can add heat to loosen.
882371,lew,2014-11-22 14:58:00,12766,"Have had to back wheel nuts a couple threads then drive the vehicle in the parking lot making turns until the wheel lets go.    Good tip Bernie, never would have thought of that one."
882383,DOS,2014-11-22 16:01:00,119,"Looking at your picture I have the exact same truck.  This summer I did my brakes for the first time since new and although I had the rims off 1 year previous I had to use a sledge hammer to take the tires off.  Then the fun came, trying to remove the rotors.  Well lets just say, a bunch of cursing and swearing, 3 busted knuckles and a real nice dent in the front quarter when a hammer slipped and we finally got it done. Needless to say there has been a liberal coating of that silver wonder on anything that needs to be removed in the future.  Dan"
882386,irishfield,2014-11-22 16:11:00,26272,"Yah.. my '11 was about as much fun a month or so ago when I had to pull a tire to find a nail in it and it was pretty fresh from a tire rotation at Ford. I have a 5' long 6 x 6 for such occasions, but damn near gave up on this Ford! Darn near knocked it off the axle stand!"
882412,lew,2014-11-22 17:57:00,12766,"Got it all done.  Even though the winter wheels were only on a week or so, I pulled them all off. There was some rust on the hubs & wheels so I used a wire wheel on my drill and gave them a good cleaning, wiped them off and applied a coat of anti seize to all surfaces and re-installed the 4 wheels.  Didn't take me too long to do the job and I should be good now and will hopefully have no issues when I put the summer wheels back on in a few months."
882420,Fisherman,2014-11-22 18:16:00,7201,A few months..   You heading south..
882422,lew,2014-11-22 18:21:00,12766,A few months..   You heading south..  I get them off as soon as possible and usually try for early April but that could be a bit optimistic this year considering the long range forecast LOL
882430,bigbuck,2014-11-22 18:33:00,2449,"Lew you did the right thing in cleeaning the hub surface with a wire wheel and coating with anti seize. Check the back of the rims too, if there is corrosion abck there, do the same thing. I remember many moons ago in high school auto shop, I was told to take my shop teachers late 70s Impala with a hopped up 350 o go in the back parking lot of the school and do some hard turns with loose lug nuts to break the wheels loose.... went back to the shop with the mission accopmplished and the car filled with tire smoke for some reason....."
882435,lew,2014-11-22 18:45:00,12766,"Check the back of the rims too, if there is corrosion abck there, do the same thing.  Back of the rims were done at the same time  Bruce so both surfaces are nice & clean with a coating of anti seize."
882460,outllaw,2014-11-22 21:40:00,1232,"for years I was the chrylser Canada tireman. we did the tractor trailer tires and cars. thru out the years auto companies went to alloys,cuts weight on vehicles down. corrosions and metal reactions. sure glad lew brought this to attention.. off topic a little them alloy rims definatly have a way of losing air in cold weather also."
882473,lew,2014-11-22 22:49:00,12766,off topic a little them alloy rims definatly have a way of losing air in cold weather also.  I have  aluminum wheels for my summer tires George and another set of aluminums dedicated to the winter tires and none of them lose hardly any air in cold weather or warm. There's some fluctuations with pressure as the temperatures change but other than that their pretty darned good. I check the pressures about every 2 weeks and  very seldom need to add air.

882488,Bernie,2014-11-22 23:20:00,3190,"When you begin to lose air in aluminum wheels it's usually corrosion between the tire and rim or at the valve stem. Cleaning this corrosion, replacing the valve stem and then painting the cleaned surface will solve the problem."
882489,irishfield,2014-11-22 23:22:00,26272,"If I only had a tire machine Bernie... keep thinking about an old manual one just to do such a thing. Many times a good air gun blast, while wobbling the stem, and some fluid film around same solves the problem on many.  We don't all live close enough to Powassan to get good auto service!"
