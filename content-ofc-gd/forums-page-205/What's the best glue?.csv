881265,jimmer,2014-11-17 18:43:00,2730,"I pulled all the carpet covered wood out of my boat. Bench seat, storage and live well. Probably have to replace all the wood also. It looks like pressure treated. I was just wonder if anyone has a suggestion for the type of glue to use on the carpet?"
881266,2 tone z71,2014-11-17 18:56:00,1311,I used the Home Hardware brand outdoor turf and carpet glue ..it's waterproof and worked great ..25 bucks a tub last time I grabbed one ..
881272,JoshS,2014-11-17 19:13:00,729,"I researched the same question a few years ago and the concensus was contact cement. Just use it when it's warmer out... harder to work in the cold. 3m super77 spray adhesive works well too, I used it for the hatches."
881275,fish_fishburn,2014-11-17 19:24:00,1311,Lepage contact cement. I have done two boats with it and no issues
881290,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-17 20:21:00,10439,I used the house brand of contact cement @ Canadain Tire when I last did my boat in the mid 90's. The stuff isn't going to fall off any time soon.

881303,jimmer,2014-11-17 21:40:00,2730,Thanks guys!
881305,HTHM,2014-11-17 21:46:00,4082,"If is an aluminum boat, do not use pressure treated wood. It will cause the aluminum to corrode."
881308,irishfield,2014-11-17 21:50:00,26272,"Yep.. the old PT was fine.. the new stuff eats most anything and why all deck brackets got changed to stainless. If you can isolate the PT from direct contact of the aluminum, like wrapping the carpet around or a gasket material fine. You also have to question your attach screws...for the same reasons."
881321,jimmer,2014-11-17 22:28:00,2730,I was planning on wrapping the carpet under the edges so wood would not be in contact with aluminium.  Marine plywood might be the better bet then? I was planning on using stainless screws. The boat really isn't that old (smokercraft) and it sure looks like pressure treated wood. I wasn't impressed how the bench seats were manufactured. I basically had to rip the wood benches off because they were screwed from underneath prior to the benches being installed into the boat.
881323,irishfield,2014-11-17 22:38:00,26272,"They are probably PT... cheaper for the mfg than marine. Noticed this summer that all the Legend pontoons are made with PT directly screwed down to the cross frame! Wrapped and stainless screws.. shouldn't be an issue. Depends on how many years you plan on keeping this boat. If it's like mine and it's my last boat 'till I die, it would be sealed marine plywood (and vinyl). If I planned to upgrade in the next 10 years it would be PT.. mind you at my stage in life.. based on my father's fate.. I might just go PT!"
881332,porkpie,2014-11-17 23:17:00,2521,"Another vote for contact cement.  I put the floor in my boat with it, as well as the deck for the bowmount.  It's rock solid!"
881335,ketchenany,2014-11-17 23:38:00,3229,"Wayne, there will be no such talk! Go with marine plywood, seal it twice."
881338,irishfield,2014-11-17 23:47:00,26272,LOL Al.. I just hope I never have to do mine! Besides.. it's guaranteed for LIFE ! Mine or the boats...
881423,Sinker,2014-11-18 14:47:00,8692,"My boat has PT wood everywhere and havent had an issue. I call Bull on the whole PT/aluminum debate. Mine is newer PT on bare aluminum. 5 years, no sign of corrosion anywhere.  S."
881643,wormdunker,2014-11-19 10:02:00,1711,"First -  I personally don't care for carpeting in my boat.  It takes longer to dry than vinyl, can get smelly from worms, minnows & fish, & the damn stuff always has a way of catching my hooks!  So when I put a new floor in my 14' Lund I purchased the vinyl from Home Depot, & used their glue.  Look at the new Lunds - their vinyl floors is the same product Home Depot sells.  That was 2 years ago & it has still held together very well.  3M 777 spray contact is also a very good product."
881675,Sinker,2014-11-19 13:24:00,8692,"Yeah, take the carpet out and leave it out. I hate it in a boat.  S."
881714,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 18:44:00,6899,"I have carpet in mine, I'm not going to say it is the best option though. I have always been nervous about vinal especially when it is cold like early spring or late fall. Does it get slippery if it gets wet?"
881716,jimmer,2014-11-19 18:59:00,2730,I just put the carpet on the seats and storage compartments. The floor is vinyl.
881724,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 19:19:00,6899,"Actually that isn't a good question. Best glue is love, it has kept Sue and I together for over 30 years!  Now for boats? Your guess is as good as mine."
881733,jimmer,2014-11-19 20:18:00,2730,I guess I should have asked my wife of over 30 years then Cliff. Can you buy it (love) in a can????
881750,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 21:46:00,6899,"You can not buy or steal it. It's like a wisp of air! You can not fake or hold it. It has to just be there!  It feels so good to get love. And yet it's fun to give! Love is that special something, That makes you want to live!  If you have never had it, Your life is not complete. If you've never been in love, I hope some day you'll meet.  A very special person, to share a life of joy. Someone that's fun to be with, a girl or a boy.  If you should ever loose it, and feel you want to die. Remember all the good times, It's worth another try!   Written many years ago by Big Cliff for the love of his life."
881876,jimmer,2014-11-20 14:07:00,2730,Well said Cliff!
