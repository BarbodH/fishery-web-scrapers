881496,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-18 21:44:00,956,Just finished my yearly shopping quest and managed to beat my PB of 3 hours and 22 minutes in a mall.
881497,irishfield,2014-11-18 21:47:00,26272,Shut up... it's November! I have 36 days yet to start mine!
881524,Joeytier,2014-11-18 22:35:00,3990,"I may be on strike, so I'll be shopping at the food bank"
881531,Rod Caster,2014-11-18 23:19:00,5784,Charlie Brown Christmas for you Joey.  3 hrs and 22 minutes in a mall isn't too bad if you do it all at once and take a year to recover.
881535,manitoubass2,2014-11-18 23:21:00,11391,"I collected alot of sticks this fall lol  j/k but seriously, this year my kids get mainly hunting gear/supplies"
881541,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-18 23:46:00,956,Got it all done and hope I don't have to do it again until next year.
881573,kenzy31,2014-11-19 01:14:00,261,"3h 22mins is a stellar time! I don't last past one hour in the Georgian Mall in Barrie! lol My wife and I decided this year that we're just going to put an allowance in our PayPal account and shop from home on a budget We're comete novices when it comes to online shopping, so wish us well :-P Any advice on cheap sites for kids stuff aged 10 and under?"
881642,wormdunker,2014-11-19 09:48:00,1711,"3 hours, 22 minutes?  Did you use the stop watch app on your iphone?  I use it for BBQing steaks!! LOL!"
881723,jimmer,2014-11-19 19:19:00,2730,I'm going south for Christmas.
881727,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 19:34:00,6899,"I'm sorry, I didn't do a lot of Christmas shopping this year.  Instead I chose to fix my neighbors snow blower for him for the cost of the parts.  Today I saw an elderlay lady shoveling a path so I went home got my little snow blower and cleaned her drive way for her! (OK, when you are almost 70, an invitation to come inside can scare the heck out of you)  A friend called, her dad is in the hospital. She is afraid to drive in this weather so I will be picking her up and we will be going for a visit.  Don't have any money for shoping, but life is good!"
881728,vance,2014-11-19 19:41:00,719,"Cliff you and I have similar tastes in Xmas presents,I would much rather do things for people than buy something for them !!!!!   vance"
881732,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 20:11:00,6899,"Vance, if only more people in this world would think that way what a wonderful world would this be. How many seniors sit alone on Christmas? Most would be so happy with only someone to share it with! Sue and I are lucky, we have family and friends. Too many others don't."
881734,jimmer,2014-11-19 20:19:00,2730,Thumbs up to you Cliff.
881745,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 21:16:00,6899,"No Jimmer, I don't deserve any thumbs up. I was brought up to do my best to help others and I have to be honest with you if it wasn't for the help of others I wouldn't be where I am today!"
881956,jimmer,2014-11-20 19:18:00,2730,That's why I gave you a thumbs up Cliff. You give back because you received. It would be a wonderful world if everyone was willing to help their neighbours. Pay it forward or pay it back.
