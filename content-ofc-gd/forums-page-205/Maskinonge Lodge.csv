882145,Joey,2014-11-21 15:47:00,9122,Got an email from Maskinonge Lodge today.  They were wondering if we were all going to go back up next year and what week.  They are thinking of getting a live band for the week we come up.  Anyone interested and what week would you want to go?  Same week as we did this year?  Joey
882150,lew,2014-11-21 16:00:00,12766,We'll be there for a week in June for musky opener Joey but can't remember the date.
882153,Rich Clemens,2014-11-21 16:14:00,3131,"Patsy and I will be there for the Musky Opener as well.   I believe it would be Saturday June 20, 2015 that we would be coming in."
882154,Rich Clemens,2014-11-21 16:15:00,3131,Maybe Regen can plant some weeds - we may need them.
882156,Joey,2014-11-21 16:18:00,9122,"Hahahaha, we'll also be there for musky opener, okay, I'll let him know"
882157,lew,2014-11-21 16:19:00,12766,"20th sounds about right Rich, 3rd Saturday in June."
882204,Rich Clemens,2014-11-21 19:28:00,3131,Would be good if others could join us
882205,Roy,2014-11-21 19:43:00,13728,I'm looking OK also and another at the end of July or beginning of August. Don't think I'll be able to take the full week in June though...more than likely an extra long weekend kind of trip. Looking forward to seeing everyone.
882443,Roy,2014-11-22 20:32:00,13728,Anybody else? I'm looking forward to it.
882480,aplumma,2014-11-22 23:06:00,6896,Looks like Joe and I will be there the same week but I need to check a few things to make sure.    Art
882487,irishfield,2014-11-22 23:17:00,26272,"What kind of ""weeds"" Rich ?"
882547,Rich Clemens,2014-11-23 11:36:00,3131,I'll be happy with those that hold toothy critters.    :-)
882548,Rich Clemens,2014-11-23 11:37:00,3131,That will be good.  I'm eyeballing my second bait-caster set up for Christmas.   Have to pass the Santa Claus test yet
882549,lew,2014-11-23 11:47:00,12766,I'm eyeballing my second bait-caster set up for Christmas. Have to pass the Santa Claus test yet  Always good to have a couple rods rigged up Rich
882580,John,2014-11-23 16:10:00,2956,Not sure we can make Muskie opener as this coming year will be a crazy one for us. Perhaps early August but we will need to play it by ear until early in the New Year. Sure would like to see all y'all in 2015.
882599,Joey,2014-11-23 17:52:00,9122,Not sure we can make Muskie opener as this coming year will be a crazy one for us. Perhaps early August but we will need to play it by ear until early in the New Year. Sure would like to see all y'all in 2015.  You too John and Bawbwa    So maybe do a musky opener and then first week in August again?
882605,Rich Clemens,2014-11-23 18:27:00,3131,Sounds reasonable to me
882608,aplumma,2014-11-23 19:13:00,6896,"first week in August is better for Joe and I.  So for the first week in August we have Art and Joe,  Roy and Jay, Joey, Allen and Paul, John and Barbara. . Any one Else for that dates?   Rich and Patsy are a no.   Art"
882609,John,2014-11-23 19:14:00,2956,Me too...lol....unfortunately reasonable and reality sometimes don't always pull in the same direction..
882610,John,2014-11-23 19:14:00,2956,"first week in August is better for Joe and I.  So for the first week in August we have Art and Joe,  Roy and Jay, Joey, Allen and Paul, John and Barbara. Rich and Patsy. Any one Else for that dates?   Art "
882618,Rich Clemens,2014-11-23 20:36:00,3131,
882619,Rich Clemens,2014-11-23 20:37:00,3131,"Unfortunately, with Patsy and I up in June and September, we won't be able to swing another one in August.  :-("
