882242,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-21 21:52:00,956,Glad everyones ok.  I fish cooks bay in the winter and the rescue crew comes around at least once a season to help people out usually at the beginning of the season.
882321,mike rousseau,2014-11-22 05:54:00,4661,I wonder if they'll be charged for the rescue... Lol...  But in all seriousness glad everyone was ok... Scary stuff...  Glad they had a cell phone...
882325,wormdunker,2014-11-22 07:37:00,1711,The circumstances surrounding this case are irrelevant.  The main thing is the guys were rescued & they are healthy.  Is that why we pay taxes?
