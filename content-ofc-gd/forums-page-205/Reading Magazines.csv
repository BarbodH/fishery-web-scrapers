881904,Beans,2014-11-20 15:39:00,3339,The thread about the flu shot brought to mind the practice of reading the magazines in doctor's offices...I don't because most of the people there are sick with sumpin' or another...Do you ???
881909,paul_614,2014-11-20 15:49:00,168,I always have my tablet with many books and movies loaded on it
881911,ketchenany,2014-11-20 16:00:00,3229,"I bring my own, but always have a tablet."
881912,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-20 16:01:00,2582,"No I don't Beansie. Most times they never have anything I'm interested in anyway. A few years back my daughter got me into doing Sudoku puzzles, so now if I have anything that involves sitting around  I grab a Sudoku book and bring it along."
881923,lew,2014-11-20 16:50:00,12766,I read them if I remember to take my reading glasses into the waiting room LOL
881929,Fisherman,2014-11-20 17:07:00,7201,More boogers and snot sneeze on those magazines than there' ink.  I bring my own.
881936,SirCranksalot,2014-11-20 17:29:00,3291,My doctor's office has thrown out their mags for that very reason---or so I was told when I asked where all the 2 year old mags were!
881955,davew3,2014-11-20 19:10:00,430,I sit as far away from others as I can and try to keep my hands in my pockets.  And when leaving grab a dose of the sanitizer opening the doors with my elbows.  I don't need to pick any bug up or pass one along.  Regards
881994,Big Cliff,2014-11-20 21:45:00,6899,"I have no idea how many Readers Digests I have read sitting in waiting rooms over the years, it was the first thing I would look for when I got there.  Now I have a smart phone and the first thing I look for is a WiFi connection LOL, the world is in my pocket!"

882004,bigugli,2014-11-20 22:12:00,6138,"Not any more. Seems the only magazines at the Dr's offices consist of health periodicals, fashion and gossip rags.  Can't remember the last time i saw an outdoors mag or Popular Mechanics. Mind you the dentist is a hockey freak, so there is always 1 copy of Sports Illustrated. Tried to donate  my old copies of OOD for reading in the hospital and was told the content was deemed ""inappropriate"""
882007,Mike Pike,2014-11-20 22:21:00,1332,"Ha ha haa,,, a fun topic Beans!  I always bring a book.  It's almost always a hardcover fishing book.  I'm into carp fishing now so I have a pile of British carp fishing books that I've ordered through Amazon and, with Doctor's appointments being what they are, you're usually sitting there for an hour or two before you get in so I get a lot of reading done!  I'm surprised how few people come prepare and almost never see anyone reading in a Doctor's office.  Texting, well, that's another matter..."
882031,Beans,2014-11-20 23:05:00,3339,I also will bring my own book or magazine...I have six sessions of BCG treatments coming up soon...reading gives me sumpin' to do while I'm waiting for the catheter to drain my bladder...
882046,MJL,2014-11-20 23:51:00,2427,"I bring my own magazines, books and sometimes my dad's tablet when I go to the hospital. Stay in an open place away from people who are coughing and sneezing.LOL"
882051,porkpie,2014-11-21 00:30:00,2521,I haven't read a paper copy of anything in years other than a newspaper.  I download to my phone or tablet and away I go!  No snotty magazines for me!!
882052,porkpie,2014-11-21 00:31:00,2521,Double tap
882058,TennesseeGuy,2014-11-21 00:48:00,957,"What about sitting on cloth chairs?   If stuff can come out of people, maybe it could find it's way back into the next guy. Might be good to sit on a magazine instead of a cloth seat."
882084,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-21 03:06:00,956,I remember a few years back I saw a bunch of magazines outside the doctors office on the floor so I decided to take them home.  My mom found out and gave me crap and said that I was trying to get everyone sick in the house cause they were covered with bacteria and boggers.  Lesson learned
