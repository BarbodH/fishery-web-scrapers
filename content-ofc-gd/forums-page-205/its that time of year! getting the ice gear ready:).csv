I got out all the tackle since we are mid pack, and decided I might as well get everything switched over...  Now I'm overwhelmed lol. 30 or so trays all over the place, Gulp packs that have decided to leak all over lol(good thing I double bag them), baits I forgot I had, lines I forgot I had etc...  pure chaos in my living room right now hahaha.  Very exciting though!  hows everyone elses experience?  I'd like to have dedicated ice trays but lots of these baits also see plenty of softwater action.  It looks crazy right now but Ill have it all pretty and organized within a few hours I hope lol (before the better half gets home!)  I just got laid off work for a few months as well, which kinda sucks and is kinda awesome! More ice fishing and smack dab in the middle of my sons hockey so I can make every game:)  woot woot! Lotsa Northlands buckshot jigs left over too! I highly recommend these lures to anyone who hasnt tried them. they iced tonnes of fish last season tipped with a frozen shiner.  so excited!!!!"

882182,Rod Caster,2014-11-21 17:50:00,5784,"I'll organize my gear the 30 minutes before the first day I go out on the ice. I'll forget a bunch of crap, snap my line several times and call myself an idiot under my breath. Then I'll come back, do a good job and I'll be ready for the rest of the season."
882183,manitoubass2,2014-11-21 17:54:00,11391,lol thats awesome!
882184,Terry,2014-11-21 18:01:00,14456,it's about the third or 4th outing when I am organized
882189,Acountdeleted,2014-11-21 18:31:00,2562,This is why my first outing is usually with Chad and or Joey. When I forget all of my gear I can just borrow some of their stuff.  I figure next weekend will be the time to pull everything out and test the gear. I've already started doing research on fish online to determine which lakes I want to hit this winter.
882193,bigugli,2014-11-21 18:45:00,6138,You guys are killing me. I'm still too busy with soft water to even think about ice gear yet.
882198,manitoubass2,2014-11-21 19:13:00,11391,whos killing who? lol  ive never fished soft water past nov 17th
882226,Fisherman,2014-11-21 21:05:00,7201,"it's about the third or 4th outing when I am organized Hahahaha, Ok, I'm probably right up there with ya, where did I put this, where's my *&@#* minnow net.  Minnow towel, etc, etc."
882269,misfish,2014-11-21 23:49:00,29133,it's about the third or 4th outing when I am organized   LMAO  NUF SAID
882273,RickOnt,2014-11-22 00:24:00,669,"Ha Ha Ha   Terry is SO right!!!  It takes about 6 trips to get the routine down so that I can remember ""most"" of my ""stuff"" and get to the Lake at a reasonable hour.  That's why there is Perching to be done before the real fishing"
