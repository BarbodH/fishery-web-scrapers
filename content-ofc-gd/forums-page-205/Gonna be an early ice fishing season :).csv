881919,lew,2014-11-20 16:31:00,12766,I drove past Chemong Lake an hour ago Joey and northen half looks like it's frozen although I doubt you'd want to walk on it.
881921,Joeytier,2014-11-20 16:34:00,3990,"-15 here tonight, but with all this friggin' snow we're getting there won't be much ice-making.  Early start to snowmobiling though"
881941,Acountdeleted,2014-11-20 17:51:00,2562,Looks very promising. I'm counting down the days.
881945,Joey,2014-11-20 18:12:00,9122,"-15 here tonight, but with all this friggin' snow we're getting there won't be much ice-making. Early start to snowmobiling though  sledding sounds good to me"
881949,AKRISONER,2014-11-20 18:44:00,5558,the warm spell next week is gonna knock a lot of that snow down...hopefully she refreezes back up compacted to make a nice hard crispy base.  Also hope it cleans off the lakes to make the ice bare so that we can actually get out on it come december.
881999,NAW,2014-11-20 22:05:00,4022,Little Lake in Barrie has a skim on it today.
882003,misfish,2014-11-20 22:07:00,29133,Little Lake in Barrie has a skim on it today.     Lets get out soon there bud. Good to hear from you
882008,Mike Pike,2014-11-20 22:24:00,1332,"Nice pics Joey!  But I'm not getting my hopes up this year.  Every year it's the same thing.  An early freeze promises an early ice fishing season, then a thaw and back to seasonal temps and a late start to the ice fishing season!  AAARGH!!!!!!!!!"
882013,Basskicker,2014-11-20 22:37:00,421,"There is anywhere from 4-8"" of ice up here already on the smaller lakes and making lots of ice!!! Going down to into the -20's again tonight. Putting the hut out on the lake on Saturday and should have a feed of walleye by sundown!!"
882092,Acountdeleted,2014-11-21 04:14:00,2562,Holy cow. I drove by the Credit River tonight and there was a skim of ice on it. Whats going on?
882094,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-21 04:23:00,10439,A plane made an emergency landing on one of the lakes around here today. I guess if there's enough ice to support a Cessna Caravan I can take my sled out.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/plane-makes-emergency-landing-on-frozen-lake-in-yellowknife/40353/    
882098,wormdunker,2014-11-21 08:28:00,1711,Putting the hut out on Saturday??  I'm jealous!  Walleye dinner by sundown?  I'll be right over!
882120,bigugli,2014-11-21 13:35:00,6138,No chance of any real ice our way. 50-55F temps our way will take care of any snow and ice in Niagara. Bring on de perchies!
882126,porkpie,2014-11-21 14:03:00,2521,"I am hoping this warm snap that is coming blows out any ice that has formed, and gets us back to where we should be.  This weather is interfering with my duck hunting, and if things keep up it will soon be interfering with my steelheading.  Things are looking grim, and I may have to travel to Georgian bay or Erie to hunt soon, my local water is freezing at an alarming rate, if it's not froze out already!  The ice can get lost as far as I'm concerned, and come back mid January!"
882134,4x4bassin,2014-11-21 15:08:00,1025,"Island Lake in Orangeville is frozen with close to an inch of ice . Crazy winter so far , I mean fall !!!!"
882319,Sinker,2014-11-22 05:40:00,8692,"I hope you didn't jinx us with this thread title!! Don't you know you never say that??  Kinda like fishing on an really windy day and saying ""hey, I think its calming down a little""......NOPE....   This time of year is a love/hate thing for me. I love to duck hunt, I love to ice fish, but I still have the hunting bug bad.....this crap came too early.  Ask me mid december and I will be praying for ice LOL  S."
882320,mike rousseau,2014-11-22 05:46:00,4661,Ummmm no  16 degrees Monday... And positive highs for the next 2 weeks... I'll be boating at least till mid December.... Hopefully longer  Man I love living on a huge river... Lol
