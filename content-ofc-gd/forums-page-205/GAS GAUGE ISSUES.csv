When traveling my gauge reads full,  even when it's not.  When I stop the needle then moves to show me what I really have.  Would this indicate that the fuel gauge is shot, or can it be adjusted?   This is my first boat with the inboard fuel tank.  Any  recommendations would be appreciated.  Regards"
881889,John Bacon,2014-11-20 14:54:00,3277,Does it read properly when idling or trolling?  Perhaps the gas shifts to the back of the tank when you are on plane and that throws the gauge off.
881897,Fisherman,2014-11-20 15:17:00,7201,Could be a loose or corroded connector at the tank.
881906,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-20 15:44:00,10439,This happens with a lot of boats. You most likely have have a tank that runs front to back and not side to side. Because of this when running the fuel runs to the rear of the tank and shows full but at trolling speed or stopped it shows the correct level. It is pretty normal as it seems most manufacturers run their tanks lengthwise.

I could probably guesstimate how much was left if I started full more reliably than using the guage on the water."
881953,davew3,2014-11-20 19:04:00,430,I am thinking it is a front to back gas tank as well.  I filled it to the very top once and now I am wondering if it is stuck there.  Has this happened to anyone else?  I guess I will keep an eye on it while out trolling on the BOQ this weekend.
881962,mattp33,2014-11-20 19:56:00,290,"Boat tanks dont have or have far less baffling in them than car tanks so the fuel moves around pretty good in them.  When the boats rises out of the water or gets bow high the fuel will run to the back of the tank, I'm guesing this is where the sender and gauge sit.  My gauge does the same thing, never trust it to read acurate.  Mine tells me I am empty and I still have 1/4 tank left.  Its a rough idea at best!"
