Jo Ann Brown had heard there was an all-white deer in the area around her husband's family farm near Stratton, about 400 kilometres west of Thunder Bay. Then she got proof. She said people in the area had told them to keep a lookout for a white fawn over the summer. Brown said it was the opening day of deer hunting season this month when she and her husband spotted it in the field. The animal was with about nine other deer, and the couple noticed where the first half of the group had already crossed the road in front of them. Brown said ""We hadn't seen him cross yet so we knew he was coming, so we drove up the road and spotted him on the right-hand side and sure enough my husband Wayne said get ready. There he went and we just happened to be in the right spot at the right time."" Brown said she is not sure if it was an albino deer because she didn't get close enough to see if it had pink eyes, but there was no brown in its coat at all. The encounter was very exciting for Brown, she said.  ""It's kinda cool because I've never seen one in my lifetime and my husband hadn't seen one either. This is the first all-white deer that he's seen."""
882101,wormdunker,2014-11-21 08:50:00,1711,Very nice to see an all white deer!  Question Does it have to have pink eyes to be considered an albino?  I've been fortunate enough to see albino (white) caribou on the Slate Islands offshore at Terrace Bay.  I don't know if they had pink eyes.  There was also an all white mature doe in Brampton a few years back near the conservation area on hwy 7
