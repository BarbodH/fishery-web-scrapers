The bonus of this is if you have to you can air it out a bit more without worrying about running on the rims in really bad weather.  Thinner tires tend to cut through the crap a lot better then the wider ones do.  I run 225 in the summer, 195's in the winter."

880432,FrankTheRabbit,2014-11-12 09:47:00,479,"I've been looking around for a set of new winters. We had the Blizzaks WS70s on our previous vehicle that lasted three winters. Always felt confident with them driving along the 401, Georgian Bay area, and in Quebec. I narrowed it down to the new Blizzaks, the WS80s, Toyo Observes GSi5s, and the Michelin Xi3s. From what I was able to gather, the Xi3s were always a top performer, until the WS80s were released this year. Preliminary testing has the WS80s nudging ahead of the Xi3s. Unfortunately, the WS80s were sold out and opted for the Xi3s.  There won't be one set of winter tires that will perform the best in every winter situation (icy roads, heavy slush, deep snow, etc), so you'll need to see what type of driving you will be doing and go from there. Also, little nuances, like road noise, dry/wet pavement handling, or fuel consumption, might be a factor in determining which set of winters will suit your preference."
880434,Mister G,2014-11-12 10:27:00,1429,Just stay away from Bridgestone tires if you want to get some decent mileage out of them. Wearing out in 40k is way too fast after spending around $1000+ on tires.  Other then that I love them.

Waited about 3 and a half hours yesterday. Drove it away and noticed a lot of vibration. Drove it on the highway and it felt like the whole car was shaking.  Brought it back in this morning and they rebalanced the tires in about a half hour. Im not too sure how but the guy said that all four tires were off a bit. Im curious if because the rims had some weights on them already they didn't bother.  Anyways driving super smooth now, hopefully I'll get to use them sometime soon I was lucky enough to get a bunch of snow at the cottage on the weekend so I could try the car without snow tires, now I'll have a good baseline to see what they're like.  I was really leaning towards blizzaks but the wear just isn't there for the marginal better ice performance.  I guess we will see how they hold up!  Thanks for all the advice guys, this community really put me off of Blizzaks lol."

877925,Entropy,2014-10-23 00:01:00,747,"If money matters you might check out Walmart's, Rovelo's.  Yep, they are cheap to buy, like most Walmart brands.  But I have no complaints."
878619,danc,2014-10-29 03:48:00,4677,A set of studded blizzaks on rims came with the Tacoma that I recently bought. I'm just waiting for the right time to put them on. That's a tough call for sure.
878664,James77,2014-10-29 17:24:00,175,I found a really good deal on Blizzaks on rims for $450 basically brand new. Going to snag those for this year and give them a shot. If I don't like I'll order something else and sell these for what I paid anyways. Thanks for all the input guys. I mostly drive in the GTA but cottage trips and montreal trips happen frequently so it's nice to be confident. I really appreciate all the feedback!  James
878705,Dutch01,2014-10-29 21:55:00,1431,I had Blizzak LM25's on my BMW and they are really great winter tires.  But I agree with the other posters here regarding wear.  I got 2.5 winters out of them and they were shot.  I've got Michelin Primacy Alpin's right now and they're not quite as good in deep snow but much better on bare roads and on ice.
878769,4x4bassin,2014-10-30 15:21:00,1025,"Sounds like a good deal on those blizzaks , like others have said great tire but very soft . I live in the snow belt of central Ontario and we get some crazy snowfalls coming off of G Bay and my X-Ice tires have always performed great . Canadian tire always have deals on snow tires this time of year as well ."
878773,Gerritt,2014-10-30 15:51:00,6129,Had Goodyear utragrips on my last car (Saturn ion) they performed well enough that I am putting them on my new car (Kia serento)  G
878828,Ainsley,2014-10-30 22:44:00,142,I'm partial to Michelin tires.  I have a set of x-ice on my subaru forester and it is a little tank in the snow.
878847,frozen-fire,2014-10-31 01:59:00,542,Another vote for Michelin X-Ice!
877591,James77,2014-10-21 00:00:00,175,"Hey guys. So earlier this year I upgraded from my 1996 4Runner with a 4"" lift and 34"" tires to my 2014 Subaru Crosstrek.  I've never bought winter tires before so I'm looking for some feedback from you outdoorsy people who get on the un-plowed roads and drive in the terrible conditions. I'm looking mostly at the Firestone Winterforce and the Blizzak WS70 winter tires. Anyone have any experience with these? I'm not expecting to be able to plow through 3' snow drifts like I could with my truck. (I miss her so much.  ) but i'd like to be able to drive in some deep stuff and not be worried about getting stuck!  Thanks  "
877592,James77,2014-10-21 00:01:00,175,Thought I should add pics of the new ride as well  
877593,mike rousseau,2014-10-21 00:10:00,4661,I had blizzaks on an intrepid.... Rediculous what that car plowed through...
877596,James77,2014-10-21 00:17:00,175,I had blizzaks on an intrepid.... Rediculous what that car plowed through... That's good news! How was the tread wear?  Thanks
877598,BillM,2014-10-21 00:21:00,17367,"Blizzaks will go through anything, but you'll get lucky to get two winters out of them if you're doing any sort of regular pavement driving (again depending on how much you drive).  They're just really really soft (Which is why they grip like crazy)  I've got Winterforces on my truck and they are great, I hardly put any miles on it so I really don't know about treadwear.  If I wanted the best snow tires I'd buy Nokian Hakkapeliittas, but they aren't cheap, although they will out last the Blizzaks by a long run."

How did you find the performance to be between the Blizzak and Winterforce? I drive a fair amount less in the winter and will only use them for the winter season.  People suggest the Winterforce does poorly on icy roads but there is so much siping and biting edges I find it hard to believe.  Thanks for your input on them!"
877606,BillM,2014-10-21 00:44:00,17367,"To be honest I haven't found any really bad 'winter' tires yet, even the Walmart cheapies that I used to drive on to and from Toronto on a daily basis did the job just fine.  Anything is better then an all season..  I really like the Winterforces I've got on my truck.  I'm currently running the same on my Jetta wagon and zero complaints.  They weren't too expensive either."
877609,mike rousseau,2014-10-21 01:02:00,4661,They wear fast... I wouldn't put em on till you need em and take em off asap
877610,Old Man,2014-10-21 01:02:00,822,I've had Hankook winter i-pikes on my vehicle for the past 2 winters and they've performed and held up well.  Last winter was a real test in our part of the country and no complaints with them so far.

877614,Joeytier,2014-10-21 01:20:00,3990,"Toyo Open Country g-02's are the only winter tires I have experience but they were fantastic, and Toyo's are hard to beat for treadwear.  Easy to beat for price, though.  Oh, and you shoulda kept the 4runner"
877616,Freshtrax,2014-10-21 01:23:00,2215,Loved my Michelin x ice on my civic and Corolla the Toyota spent many a day miles off shore on simcoe.
877619,Raf,2014-10-21 01:33:00,3495,"not sure where you live/how much true snow driving you'll do  the blizzak$ are great but wear fast,  like bill said, any winter tire will be better.  i got some sumitomo winters for cheap on our mazda, they do just fine.  if you are just driving in the gta in the winter i wouldn't $pend on the blizzaks."
877621,Sinker,2014-10-21 01:36:00,8692,"I had these on my subaru forester XT and it was crazy the amount of snow it would go through. I did  laps around my buddies 4x4 chev out on lake scugog in deeep snow and laughed at him LOL. Great tires. My work also runs them on our fleet of work vehicles and they last pretty good. Again, not the cheapest rubber, but they are worth it. I swear by them. Great on the hwy too.... most of my driving is on the hwy, at speed. Love them for that.  S."
877629,lookinforwalleye,2014-10-21 01:55:00,4399,Been using Winterforce on my jeep for the last  3 winters with no issues!
877635,cram,2014-10-21 02:24:00,1733,"I have Blizzaks on a Highlander and they're great..  MIchelin XIce  on wifester's car, and they seem good as well but I don't drive it as much.  Lots of options though. You might check out the ratings on Tirerack.com whether you buy from them or not."
877640,Dara,2014-10-21 02:47:00,3052,"I had never run winter tires till last year. It was always just the At's that came with a Ford  Last year I got one with the stupid Perrelis so I bought a set of Blizzacs....we had 12 feet of snow and I barely put it in 4 wheel drive...just didn't need it, even pulling a trailer...as far as tread wear I never noticed, the roads always had snow on them anyway...hoping for another excellent winter"
877669,ecmilley,2014-10-21 10:15:00,2163,Winterforce ok tire there cheap and decent in snow not so good on ice. The blizzaks are great tires wear quick though. Michelin x ice go anywhere great on ice and snow and the only snow tire with a mileage warranty. Goodyear ultra grip ice and dunlop graspicds series also competent tire yojohama ig series gruppy but wears fast. Make your choice fast popular brands and sizes going fast at this time of year. Also look at rebates traditionally michelin has 100 mail in on x ice this time of year other brands are similar
877673,Mister G,2014-10-21 11:08:00,1429,After 2 sets of Bridgestone's on my truck I have sweared never to buy them again. They do the job and don't vibrate or fail but the tread wear is bad VERY BAD.....save your money and get something else.
877677,DanD,2014-10-21 11:34:00,2223,"Buy the tire you want/can afford, after doing price comparisons between the different dealers selling that brand of tire. After the third season, Kijiji them while they still look like they have decent tread. After you've worn off the first 4/32"" of tread (new 11-12/32"") they are no more then a pacifier; they make you feel good that you have snows on. IMHO a snow tire worn done past 6-7/32"" is no better then a new all-season tire at 9-10/32"" thread.  Dan."
877683,bigbuck,2014-10-21 12:46:00,2449,Buy the best tires you can afford. Shop around though. There are deals to be had if you take the time to find them. Take a day and hit a bunch of shops and compare apples to apples.
877691,BillM,2014-10-21 13:33:00,17367,"If you want good prices, order from the US, drive over, get the tires installed and drive back.  Even with the exchange rate you'll save quite a bit of money."
877698,manitoubass2,2014-10-21 14:38:00,11391,Sounds like i should go buy some blizzaks for my new ride. Ice is a huge probrlem up here and i also plan on lots of lake of the woods driving/fishing this ice season

They'll be better then anything else without studs."
877701,manitoubass2,2014-10-21 14:44:00,11391,Are they really? I thought they were deemed illegal years ago??? I never see anyone with studs?maybe thats because the highway goes from solid ice to bare half the time?
