882484,irishfield,2014-11-22 23:13:00,26272,"Lots to do a search on there.... I think it's been well covered in the last 8+ years.  That said... it all depends on ice conditions and travel to make your stay the most enjoyable.  Loon Lodge gives you easy access to their facilities (no matter the ice conditions) and with huts out front.  John's bungalows...  Someone had a bunch of bungalows up past Ketcheneny last year, but not sure who's they were.  If the ice is good.. you can drive all the way down to Tamar and they keep an almost 15 mile ice road plowed.  Temagami Lodge, on Temagami Island, if the ice road is in to Bear Island. Linda's Wigwams on Bear Island for cabins... etc.  Starting to think I should stay up there all winter and run a Room and Board affair..."
882532,irishfield,2014-11-23 05:39:00,26272,BTW.. the search function works best if you hit the little gear / wheel beside the magnifying glass and do an advanced search. Type in Temagami.. and then select titles only.. not content.

882559,Musky or Specks,2014-11-23 13:35:00,2710,Does Temagami Lodge still run ice fishing operations? Back when Paul and Julia ran the place its the only operators I use to use.
882578,irishfield,2014-11-23 16:06:00,26272,"I believe it was sold a couple years back, MorS, and it looks like the new owners may not do winter.  http://www.temagamilodge.com  I'm pretty sure Rick Lockhart (former co-owner of Ketcheneny Lodge) still does ice fishing out of his newer place in Spawning Bay. www.wishinyouwerefishin.com"
882710,Parnelly,2014-11-24 12:28:00,108,"Do any of the places offer overnight ice shacks. I know Moskwa from loon lodge does, but who else?  John Hardings website I was sort of unclear of, says you get an ice bungalow, and a separate shack for fishing, are they both on the ice?"
