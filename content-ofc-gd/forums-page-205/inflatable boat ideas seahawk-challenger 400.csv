882409,huzzsaba,2014-11-22 17:43:00,884,I recently bought a used inflatable boat to use on small lakes and rivers.  I plan to do some work on it like putting hard floor for stability and possibly a small trolling motor.  I plan to put 2 adults  and at the most 2 adults and 2 children.  Looking for ideas to make the boat better and safer.    Buying a bigger boat is not an option because of lack of storage space.  Thanks
