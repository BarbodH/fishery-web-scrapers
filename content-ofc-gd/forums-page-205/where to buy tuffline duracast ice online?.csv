882638,MCTFisher9120,2014-11-23 22:24:00,3761,We stocked it last year. We have a spool or 2 left in 30lb ice line (a little heavy haha). Our US shipment of ice fishing has yet to arrive still. If we get it in I'll post back here for ya 123chadder.  I have a few rods with it still. Awesome braid for the cold.
