879762,reelingMachine,2014-11-07 02:25:00,29,Hard Merch and Pinwheel are my fav. Glad Hard Merch got their best fish few hours before season closed. Glad Pinwheel finished ahead of Merediths.
879793,Garnet,2014-11-07 12:26:00,2056,Watch boats fishing on Stellwagon looks boring as hell. The south boys looks fun.
879825,mattybculp,2014-11-07 15:46:00,388,"That Paul guy drives me nuts, I think its the whine in his voice, not the accent."
879849,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-07 19:47:00,8243,"Paul's the best! He's has the voice for sure that will drive some people mad. I call it running out of air before the sentence is finished. He shaw is a pissah he is. The best scene is when he is taking out his brand new leased boat as capt. from harba on his first trip of the season and is heading left of the red buoy, band scrape boom he bottoms out then blames the crap electronics. Paulie, red right return green right go!"
882621,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-23 21:05:00,956,Can't wait until the next season.  Love the show and hope the southern guys head up north to challenge dot.com and pinwheel.

879255,Joey,2014-11-03 08:42:00,9122,My Fave is Hard Merchandise
879274,mattybculp,2014-11-03 14:26:00,388,I remember saying to the wife that my favourite boat is also hard merchandise. Sometimes you don't know if his boat will make it back to dock.
879289,Tim Mills,2014-11-03 16:23:00,476,"I've watched the show. I'd like to know the ""reality"" behind the filming of these shows like Wicked Tuna, Mountain Men etc.  A guy I was fishing with a couple of weeks ago was the camera boat for one of Henry W's shows a couple of years ago.  The fishing was tough so the camera boat was fishing too.  When the camera boat hooked up they drove over to Henry's boat  and handed him the rod then they started filmed him reeling in the fish."
879291,outllaw,2014-11-03 16:30:00,1232,"yep we want reality. so there it is.. watching a fishing show ,the only reality is the commercials lol."
879299,tb4me,2014-11-03 17:38:00,3295,"I actually enjoy wicked Tuna. I have this season on the PVR and im 2 weeks behind.Its true I do get anxiety watching sometimes.. My wife cant stand catch a contractor for that reason..Im a contractor (that takes pride in my work) and some of these hillbilly hacks they find crack me up, the wife on the other hand cant sit thru the show..It winds her right up...lol"
879300,BillM,2014-11-03 17:45:00,17367,"I wish it wasn't so scripted..  That being said, if it wasn't it would probably be REALLY boring.   Some of the dialog is so bad, you just gotta laugh."
879307,Joey,2014-11-03 18:27:00,9122,"Ya, but I love how Hard Merch always has a smoke in his mouth and seems to be the only ""real"" fisherman out there.  All the rest seem scripted.   He does it to make a living, the rest, I'm not so sure."
879309,leaf4,2014-11-03 18:37:00,2466,"I watch it, hard merch always seems like he's behind or playing the underdog card, that's just the shadow that is cast on him for some reason, I actually like Tyler and Paul together, they seem to work well together and Tyler is pretty impressive and his ambition is second to no one IMO"
879312,Gerritt,2014-11-03 18:48:00,6129,Wicked tuna? What network ?

879541,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-05 08:17:00,8243,"That's what I call entertainment, watching guys go to work, fun wow. Ice Road Truckers is my educated and rather cerebral wife's favorite guilty pleasure. I have tried to watch it and have to leave the room it's so badly scripted. Then I find I have to come back to see what happened for the same cliff hanger before each and every commercial, did the 52 foot rig go through the ice and drown the trucker in a cold watery icy grave? They never go through the ice and no one ever dies on reality TV but we wait for something that never happens on TV. Trucking on those roads is a dangerous profession at 27 cents a kilometer to boot.  Wicked Tuna is my guilty pleasure, I started watching it this summer and I haven't missed a North vs. South. Nice fat in the vein, good marble, great core you should get maybe,,,,,,, wait,,,,,,,,wait,,,,,,, $18.00 a pound. It's the same show each and every episode and I love it, the Dr's don't know why. The sad thing is these guys are risking their lives, that's not scripted and that's real, and that Tuna is going for $1000.00 a pound or more in Tokyo, that's not fair. Someone is making huge money and it's not the fisherman. Another good one is the fishing guys in Newfoundland, it's Cold Water Cowboys, they are speaking English in Canada and we need English subtitles to know what they are saying. that's funny. Ontario and NFLB, two distinct cultures separated by a common language."
879566,fisherman7,2014-11-05 12:53:00,325,"The guy who captains the ""Dot Com"" boat is also a pilot for Jet Blue. He says as he saying goodbye to the passengers he always gets ""Where have I seen you before"" look."
879592,Steve,2014-11-05 17:20:00,2075,Fun show....just wish they would watch their editing and maybe take it more seriously. (i guess they don't have to however).  in the middle of a single fight of a single fish I saw the reel change four times and the weather conditions change three times.  stuff like that bugs me.

879603,Steve,2014-11-05 18:29:00,2075,"there is an east coast fishing board where hard merchandise posts on.  apparently there is quite a bit of use of cinder blocks tied to rods and chucked overboard so they can get all the right angles of a rod doubling over....  typical realty tv show.  but still better than much of what is on tv these days.  been watching ""Rome"" lately....now that is a good show!!"
