882111,Mister G,2014-11-21 12:06:00,1429,"Your back up generator is a super idea (as long as your sump pump doesn't fail). Personally I think they are nice to have but how often would you ever really use it? I have a 6500 watt generator sitting here, house is all wired up for it and it will do everything I need if we have a power failure. It has been sitting here for 5 years and so far it has had about two hours use.  I do think you would be better looking at alternatives other than the back up generator. Actually a back up generator like you have is a excellent idea on top of the water driven pump and MUCH cheaper then a auto run generator running on natural gas or propane.  We also have one and I believe it's also a 6500 watt start up, 5500 running generator. I had the house wired to accept a huge 30 amp feed line to the bottom of my main fuse box and will run the complete house.......however, I never tried to run the central air with it YET."
882113,wormdunker,2014-11-21 12:38:00,1711,"Thanx Mister G - My instructions say to use 1/2"" supply line but 3/4"" is preferred.  Yup, I will definitely follow their instructions.  I'm not one of those guys -  ""If all else fails, read the instructions""  LOL!"
882149,Mister G,2014-11-21 15:58:00,1429,"The 3/4"" feed line gives you much more water flow and pressure that will overcome lifting the water out of the sump hole and up above your grade as well as sending it on it's way to wherever you are pumping it to."
882208,aplumma,2014-11-21 19:57:00,6896,Check with the local plumbing codes to see if a backflow preventer is needed to keep you from contaminating your water supply when using the water pump systems.    glad you have the answers you needed to make your decisions.   Art

The electrical code requires that you use an approved manual transfer switch to switch between utility and generator power so that there is no way both can be turned on at the same time.  Your generator can backfeed onto the grid and is dangerous for hydro workers not to mention what will happen to your generator if the main power comes back on while the genny is on line.  They aren't really expensive but can be a pain to hook up."

881407,wormdunker,2014-11-18 09:09:00,1711,"I'm researching info to install a back up sump pump system in my home.  I enjoy all of the technical help on this site - so I want to ask your opinions.  I've looked at the battery back up systems such as Power Hub 1800, Liberty pumps, Zoehler  & a few others.  I do like the systems that have the battery power back up as well as the second sump pump to back up the primary pump for peace of mind.  Your comments & opinions are appreciated.  Thanx"
881409,Big Cliff,2014-11-18 11:37:00,6899,"Back up sump pumps I don't know a lot about but last year I bought a ""water monitor alarm system"" at Home Hardware for about $275.00. It comes with a remote sensor and can even be programed to dial your cell phone in the event that the alarm is triggered. Might be worth looking at."
881415,wormdunker,2014-11-18 13:12:00,1711,Thanx Cliff.  I'm also looking into a similar alarm.  Great that it will notify me if there is a water problem at home.  What I really need is a system that will pump water when wifey & I are out of town.
881481,aplumma,2014-11-18 20:30:00,6896,back up sump pumps are rarely effective to prevent water damage. First most of the 12 volt units have cheap chargers that cook the batteries and a class 27 battery will run for 6 hours only. The second issue is if it pumps 2000 gallons an hour that is only when the battery is at 100 percent. At 75 percent it is only 1500 gallons an hours etc. The amount of lift and friction loss on a run of pipe will cut the flow rate way down so the 2000 GPH is decreased to 900 GPH with as little as a 15ft head and a 20ft run.  They do give you a false sense of security but they are only a glorified marine pump.   The water monitor can notify any phone # so if you leave town the neighbor can take the call and get a small generator going on it.  Art
881482,Entropy,2014-11-18 20:37:00,747,"We have a Home Sitter (monitors hot cold water and power outage).  I bought it at TSC for $70, it calls my cell when any of the bad stuff happens.  We pump lots of water in the spring.  I have a ""low"" pump and a ""high"" pump.  If the low one quits the high one will take over, or if the low one is overwhelmed, the higher one would help out.  Both pumps are on different circuits, and both have separate discharge lines.  The low one is burried outside, the high one is above ground.  Both discharge lines will totally drain by gravity.  Reason for two separate lines is if one freezes solid and is totally screwed, the other one will work and can be heated with an outside heat line, or heater.My neighbour has a battery backup, and it dies way too soon.  It is pointless.  A backup generator is the way to go.  Entropy"

881588,G.mech,2014-11-19 01:44:00,830,I have lot of water to pump especially in winter and spring and we aren't home during the day.  I have a similar 'high/low' pump with separate lines like Entropy said which works great but if the power goes out I would be doomed within an hour.  I now have an automatic standby generator to back them up but before I got it I put in a half decent battery backup system. I put two batteries on it and it would keep things in check for about 12 hours and it runs about 1/3 of the time.  It saved our bacon a number of times when we weren't around. I now have all three systems so there is no possible way anything could ever go wrong......right????
881608,wormdunker,2014-11-19 02:36:00,1711,"Thanx for all the valuable info. I do like Entrophy's idea of a high & low 2 sump pump system.  I also like the idea Entrophy stated about using separate circuits for the 2 pumps.  Makes sense to me. Apluma I understand your point of the lift the pump must push the water.  I measured the height from the bottom of my sump pit to point where the discharge hose exits my house.  It is only 90"".  My present discharge line is 1 1/4"" smooth pvc pipe - so minimal friction.  Also, after exiting my basement wall the discharge line is a good slope of about a 2' drop from the exterior basement wall to the drainage ditch at my back property line.  Thanx for the info about cooking the batteries.  I was going to use my 2 interstate deep cycle batteries from my boat but I don't want to fry them.  They are rather expensive. G mech - I also like your idea of an automatic standby generator.  Would you be so kind as to educate me on how the automatic generator system is wired.  What size genny do I require?  I do like the Honda gennys as they are very quiet to operate. Once again thanx for your input guys.  Tomorrow I'm going to visit my local Honda dealer to investigate generators.  I'll keep you updated."
881614,Entropy,2014-11-19 02:47:00,747,"LOL, when I get the call from my house and race home to fire up the genny,  I have often asked myself .... ""What happens when this genny quits?"".  Buy a good auto start up one, and a small cheap one.  Two are better than one, but you have to run them every 2 to 4 weeks, to ensure they will perform when needed.  The first time it works, it saves THOUSANDS in damage and a big pain in the butt.  Entropy"
881616,G.mech,2014-11-19 02:52:00,830,Here is a link to a previous thread on the generator discussion.  Lew posted pics of his install.  Mine is very similar only a bit bigger and a bit older.

881630,Freshtrax,2014-11-19 03:30:00,2215,I have no sump pump.   But I do  have a water leak sensor that will call my cellphone . It's part of my home security system.   Gives me peace of mind I can call the neibour to shut the water off if I'm out of town.  Check with your insurance company mine gave me a steep discount for having it.
881637,wormdunker,2014-11-19 09:10:00,1711,"Freshtrax - thanx for your input.  The water sensor to call my cell phone would be ideal as I have 2 or 3 very good neighbours who would offer assistance if we're out of town. Entrophy - Yup for sure 2 are better than 1.  I'm going to be looking at generators today. G. mech - thanx for providing the link to a previous discussion.  I had previously read that post but, as usual forgot where it was located.  (alzheimers is not a good thing - but  1 positive would be - you can hide your own Easter eggs!!)  Very good info.  Thanx"
881741,aplumma,2014-11-19 20:41:00,6896,If you decide to go with the battery back up I recommend with hesitation( because they do the job marginally if you keep up on the batteries) zoeller 507 with 2 AMG deep cycle batteries in line (wired for 12 volt ) and a guest marine charger. This will give you a charging system that is as good as the one in your boat as well as excellent stand by capacity. The pumps will also need to have separate check valves if you need a diagram send me a P.M..   Art

881849,wormdunker,2014-11-20 08:56:00,1711,"Thanx guys.  I did go shopping yesterday.  Here's what I found.  Honda portable gas generator , 2000 watt $1300.00 - expensive but quiet to operate & fuel efficient.  Generac same size $750.00 but a little louder than the Honda.  I do no want a Champion generator.  I also searched the water powered systems but they do consume about 1 gallon of city water to discharge 1 gallon on sump water.  The Zoeller 507 systems seems to be a very good unit.  But, then there is the cost of 2 AGM batteries to consider.  Now the Cadillac of power supply systems - it's similar to Lews. Koehler 8000 watt generator which will run my whole house in the event of a power outage.  It is wired directly to my house panel, powered by natural gas or propane.  It will automatically turn on when the hydro goes out & will keep all my electrical equipment operating in a normal fashion.  Fridges, freezer, furnace, sump pump, TVs, computers.  Awesome! Cost is $4,000.00, installation approx. 800.00 + tax.  Total about $5,400.00.  Awesome!  Decisions - decisions??"
