881899,irishfield,2014-11-20 15:23:00,26272,They're gonna need a survey crew just to tell them where the street is !
881907,Mister G,2014-11-20 15:46:00,1429,"more evidence of global warming.  BTW...here in Toledo, the all time low for 11/18 was broken yesterday....by 5 degrees!! There has always been climate change and there will always be climate change."
881925,lew,2014-11-20 16:55:00,12766,That's wid.  Thought I saw where temps could hit the 50's by Monday.     That could cerate another mess for the folks up there.  Just imagine how heavy that 7 or 8 feet of snow on the roofs will be when the warm temps arrive.
881928,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-20 17:06:00,10439,Here's a great bunch of pics from Buffalo. I especially like the fifth from the bottom. The guy digging out his car. That looks like fun.  http://globalnews.ca/news/1680475/in-photos-incredible-images-as-historic-snowstorm-blankets-upstate-new-york/
882002,jedimaster,2014-11-20 22:07:00,3472,"Sorry guys. Its 9 degree today, feels like double digits. It is overcast, but the maples still haven't fully shed there leaves and I sat by the river today having my lunch on a bench in a dress shirt. No need for a jacket yet."
882009,landry,2014-11-20 22:25:00,1005,That is a priceless comment. Well done:)
882105,Mister G,2014-11-21 11:32:00,1429," Just imagine how heavy that 7 or 8 feet of snow on the roofs will be when the warm temps arrive. Actually if it doesn't rain, it will be less every minute."
882107,lew,2014-11-21 11:56:00,12766,"Actually if it doesn't rain, it will be less every minute.  Pick up a shovel full of snow on a cold day, then pick up the same amount of snow on a warm day and what do you notice ??"
882108,dave524,2014-11-21 11:57:00,4508," Just imagine how heavy that 7 or 8 feet of snow on the roofs will be when the warm temps arrive.  I think he was just having fun with us. Like "" what is heavier a pound of lead or a pound of feathers ??""  But yes , rain will make the situation very bad."
882143,Thrilla,2014-11-21 15:32:00,164,Here's a great bunch of pics from Buffalo. I especially like the fifth from the bottom. The guy digging out his car. That looks like fun.  http://globalnews.ca/news/1680475/in-photos-incredible-images-as-historic-snowstorm-blankets-upstate-new-york/   Could have some epic snowball fights in those trenches 
882151,Mister G,2014-11-21 16:04:00,1429," I think he was just having fun with us. Like "" what is heavier a pound of lead or a pound of feathers ??""  But yes , rain will make the situation very bad. I think you are right. 7 feet of snow on a roof weighs the same or LESS once the temp rise and it finally starts to melt, at least as far as weight on the roof. And as Lew has said it now heavier to shovel it off, but no need to unless rain is in the forecast."
882155,Rich Clemens,2014-11-21 16:17:00,3131,I thought I heard of some possible rain this week-end up there - then hit 60 by Monday. Those folks could have some additional problems - that they really don't need. Buddy of mine says West Senaca has 8' already
882163,blaque,2014-11-21 16:34:00,2419,"So far down here there have been 30 roof collapses, and i believe 70 partial collapses. They evacuated a nursing home in the town next to me for fear of a collapse (2 elderly folks died during the transport which makes the death total 12). Ive seen states of emergency come and go over the years with snow storms, but this one.......is the real deal"
882375,Tim Mills,2014-11-22 15:27:00,476,The pictures are incredible.  You really have to be prepared down there. I hope your community is getting the state and federal support it needs.  I'm surprised there have not been more deaths.  I believe snow shovelling alone results in a large number of heart attacks each year. Good luck.
882785,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-24 18:50:00,10439,Here's a great image for the area. Love that people have a sense of humor still.  https://twitter.com/Burkie716/status/536589715328466944/photo/1

881570,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-19 01:02:00,956,"A few years ago I got my AZ license and my first trip was down to Philly.  Went down no problem, but when I came through Buffalo it was complete whiteout.  Never went in a transport truck again after that trip."

881575,OhioFisherman,2014-11-19 01:16:00,6623,"A lot of road driver for companies I worked for liked the Buffalo run, it was easy to go there and back in a day, at least in the summer! LOL Their stories convinced me not to try it during the late fall or winter."
881577,Rich Clemens,2014-11-19 01:18:00,3131,Another shot of Buffalo - taken by a buddy of mine. 
881587,blaque,2014-11-19 01:43:00,2419,That's my route for tomorrow morning for a meeting in pa.  I see another day of hookie in my future
881590,Rich Clemens,2014-11-19 01:48:00,3131,"Blaque.   May want to check.   The guy that took these pics that I posted, lives not too far from Ellicotteville NY.   There must be a state of emergency.  At least where he lives, they are not permitted to be on the roads unless it is an emergency.  Not sure how long the restriction is lasting - or if it has been lifted yet."
881601,Rod Caster,2014-11-19 02:21:00,5784,"That is ridiculous! We seem to get it often, but never that bad. Holy cow."
881605,blaque,2014-11-19 02:30:00,2419,"Ya,  im only a couple miles from I-90. I'll be watching the road closures closely.  I took a short ride today between white outs and ran into police points telling people to get off the road.  My town had a travel ban I was unaware of. Had to get some snacks for for the sabres game lol"

881670,lew,2014-11-19 12:56:00,12766,This mornings news says Buffalo is getting a years worth of snow this week.  Guess global warming hasn't reached New York State yet
881672,porkpie,2014-11-19 13:02:00,2521," Edited... Just read Cheektowaga forecast, 16 inches between now and tomorrow AM.  Forget It, I'm staying home and finishing my drywall project!"

881690,lunkerbasshunter,2014-11-19 15:39:00,2585,What I would be worried about is flooding.  Warm temps this weekend will mean some nasty floods.  Crazy amount of snow for this time of year.
881729,blaque,2014-11-19 19:43:00,2419,"Thanks man......been home all day behind a snowblower diggin out neighbors lol. falling snow moved out for the time being,  but another band of Lake effect is coming tonite callin for 1-2 more feet. Until then, YouTube is a possibility lol"
