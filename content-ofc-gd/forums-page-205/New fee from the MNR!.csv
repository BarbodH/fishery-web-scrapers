Talked to a few fellas this week that hunted. A group of 12 guys had one doe tag. They seen more does then they had seen in years. They asked why the low number of doe tags in their area.  Answer? The hard winter last year. OMG  Like most wildlife, deer populations fluctuate and follow a natural cycle. The population has been on the decline over the last couple years and the severe winter last year had a big impact and killed plenty of deer leaving many area's with much lower populations. Just because your buddies saw a bunch of deer in the specific area/bush they hunted does not mean the rest of the WMU also has the same high population density. Take the WMU I hunt for example. At the properties where I hunt I haven't noticed any decline over the last few years even though many other hunters report seeing fewer deer. A few years ago we could get 6 additional tags for this WMU, this year they're offering 0. I'm fine with that. Keeping a healthy deer herd is far more important than me putting meat in my freezer.   While it sucks not having as much venison in the freezer, it would suck even more if the MNRF disregarded the falling deer population and continued to offer tags for WMU's that cannot sustain the harvest simply to increase revenue. The result would be even fewer tags for years to come and even more time for the population to rebound.  We should be thanking the MNRF for monitoring the deer and moose populations, not frowning upon them"

Wouldn't there be a lot of pressure to continue to issue tags in order to continue the revenue stream?  I'm not sure the MNR would be professional enough (at some levels) to reduce the tags sufficiently when the population is under duress.  Cutting tags reduces money to an already strapped Ministry.

As far as paying for a fishing license and all of that, I think I might have gone out fishing 6 or 8 times last year and I think I might have kept 20 fish mostly crappie which I believe are an invasive species anyway.

The original idea behind the provincial license was to fund a special conservation account. Our politicians, in their usual wisdom, saw this as a way to replace provincial budget funds and give to other political pet projects. What makes you think the surtax is any different.  Truth be the government is trying to implement all sorts  of new charges and fees. Lets face it, the Premier has promised a $20billion urban transit plan. That money is going to come out of our pockets, one way or another."

Its childish and sneaky and makes me think that the government thinks we have no brains. Although it sure looks like some fit the bill as they are all for the new tax. And don't try to tell me that its a special fee just for fishermen and hunters...I see it going to pay for windmills  They are calling them ""revenue tools"" nowadays and all they are is new taxes.  A little bit of honesty in government would go a long way to me accepting this crap.  And I for one, don't want to see any more cops or CO's when I'm fishing...another ""revenue tool"""

Which is why it's important to save for retirement if you plan on continuing to enjoy recreational activities like you did before retirement.

A timmies every day equals about $50-60 per month while smokes come in anywhere between $100-300 depending on your brand, and yet people are up in arms when the MNRF wants an additional $2 per year, or a whopping $0.165 per month!"

While they could continue to offer up to 6 additional tags per WMU after the population declines, the result would be far less revenue generated in the long run as it would take even longer for the herd to recover. It's a good thing that the MNRF does what's best for the herd, not what's best for humans.    Want to increase the deer population? Put a bounty on the coyoties! I have seen more coyoties in the WMU I hunt than deer this year.   Many studies have proven this to be a myth and coyotes do not have such a huge impact on deer populations as many people believe. Sure, they'll take a bunch of fawns every spring and takeout any unhealthy adults, but coyotes alone do not have that great of an impact on the herd. They're relatively new to Ontario, but if you look at area's in the states that have high coyote populations you'll see the deer herds doing just fine.  Deep snow and severe cold will have a far more negative effect on the herd than coyotes...   A bounty would be nice to help pay for gas and equipment, but where would the MNRF find the extra funds to pay out a bounty on every coyote killed? Increase fees for hunting licenses?"

881462,Old Man,2014-11-18 17:21:00,822,"Reading the rational put forward by the MNR for this increase is an interesting look into how the minds and accounting abilities of government bureaucrats work or, doesn't. While the SPA may be solely funded from licenses, permits and fee's issued for hunting and fishing activities, these are not the only revenue streams that  generate dollars for the provincial government from these activities. The provincial government also receives revenues related to hunting and fishing through taxes on goods and services such as sales tax, income tax and business taxes relating to these activities, but of course, all this money ends up in general revenue accounts to be wasted on things like MaRs, Ornge, gas plants etc.  For those that say ""it's only $2"" and ""Living within your means applies to everyone, including seniors on pensions."" should remember that this isn't the first $2. There has been many $2 preceding it, and many future $2 to come. That ""living within your means"" should apply to government as well. Many governments, especially this current provincial government, show a decided lack of respect for tax payers money and an addiction to just keep on going to the well for more."

After providing the documentation he started more filtered try again please chatting with us and he mentioned that he caught 40 without even using a rod and reel (he was infering that he handed out 40 tickets).

X2 X2. Taxes keep going up, honestly is there anyone out there who doesn't know that? My folks live very frugal so that was my upbringing. My dad used to always compare a co workers life to ours. Both families with 3 kids, both families had both parents working making the same amount of money. My folks had a house and a cottage paid for before my parents where 40. The other family still had a mortgage when my dad's co worker retired at 65. My dad retired at 57.  His kids who where the same age as my brother sister and I  where the kids in school who had everything. Never packed a lunch always bought lunch from the cafeteria at school. They went on $$$ vacations every winter....our family went to Florida twice. I could go on and on, but I think my point has been made.  Fast forward to the present. I see the same thing in a large % of all my co-workers and the whole population in general. People have lived there enter lives above there means. The good old days are gone people. This is a global condition not something we can blame  on our own government. If you can't see that then I think you are the one who needs a reality check. Politicians are just people like you and I. Most of us are not willing to take any real financial responsibility for our futures so what makes anyone think the government will think differently? I think the next 20-30 years are going to be tough, like back during the depression...before my time. If you are middle class like myself and you have not been frugal with your money and lived within your means, then I think you might be in a little bit of trouble.  Some people through no fault of there own get dealt some crappy cards and end up with a bleak future and no real chance at a decent retirement. Most of us however have had more then a fair chance at the future/ retirement that they would be very happy with. They just chose not to take any responsibility in preparing for it properly.

880740,Rod Caster,2014-11-14 14:08:00,5784,"You should see some of the fee increases they are levying, or proposing to levy. The worst ones are the non-general public ones, the ones that get little to no attention. For example, an MTO encroachment permit (a permit to work with the MTO right of way) is currently $520. It will be $2,080 in two years! They want that deficit paid off!  The $2 increase for fishing doesn't bother me, it does a bit more for hunting. It's already difficult to legally harvest a deer/moose/bear especially if you work full time and can't get a lot of time off. If they opened up more deer tags or gave a few more days in riffle season, I'd accept higher fees. Maybe I'm just pissed that I can't seem to find a deer when I know they are everywhere haha.  I kind of agree that seniors should pay for licenses, maybe not in full, half or something. A lot of people still work well into retirement, they can income split and generally spend less with age. Demographics are much different now.  One truck load of scrap metal, or not eating out one time pays for your year-round fishing license...perspective."
880750,Joeytier,2014-11-14 15:44:00,3990,"That's it.  A conservation-minded angler can still harvest enough fish to eat fish a couple times a week all year for under 30 bucks.  Hell of a deal as far as I'm concerned.  The $2 fee doesn't bother me, but what does bother me is that the MNR will likely never become a funding priority for the province, and will be perpetually underfunded.  I'd argue that they do a damn fine job with the hand they've been dealt!"

Something that all levels of government fail to accomplish.  That report highlighted three main drivers of the reduced revenue experienced by the special purpose account. The other two that you didn't mention are HUGE!  1. The decline of the fishing population. In ~33% of the 2010 fishing license holders did not renew in 2011, a significant blow to the money generated.  2. Baby boomers reaching retirement age. Much like the CPP issue, the number of people reaching that magic number will continue to increase. Combine that with the younger generations being less inclined to enjoy the natural resources, we're going to be in big trouble there.  3. The MNRF is not doing enough to recoup costs. Licensing is not covering the cost of managing the fisheries. This finding was part of the Drummond report, a liberal initiative.'  In addition, the increasing threat of climate change, invasive species and disease will continue to put a strain on fisheries management."

Talked to a few fellas this week that hunted. A group of 12 guys had one doe tag. They seen more does then they had seen in years. They asked why the low number of doe tags in their area.  Answer? The hard winter last year. OMG

So all the the original funding went elsewhere in the gubmint and the license $$$$ taken in are less than the $$$$ they took away.

Sorry to those more ""experienced"" than I.  This is coming from a guy who voluntarly used to buy a sport licence when a conservation would have done even through Uni when some years I didnt even fish.  I support that if all the funds stay within the MNR for fishing related costs and ENFORCEMENT of laws and regulations.  Many years ago the MNR got away from enforcement and into management.  How many threads on this board are people bellyaching about the LACK of enforcement of the regs?  This fee is a step in the right direction.  What do you ""get"" for it - you get to fish some of the best freshwater in the World.  I dont want Ontario to wind up like the UK where you have to pay thousands a year to private clubs to fish carp.  What if someone said the two bucks was going directly to fight Asian Carp or to hire a few new COs to enforce the regs?  Thesefunds will be staying in the MNR coffers and that is a huge step forward.
