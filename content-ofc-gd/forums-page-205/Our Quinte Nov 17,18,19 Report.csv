First day we launched at Bath and fished by the island, I caught a Brown Trout, which was a surprise.no Walleye caught that day. It rained the whole time we were out.Tues day was a bust with 90 K winds but we still tried. we launched in Picton and went out for a hour but the wind was so bad you couldn't troll, it blow us all over.Wednesday we launched at the Ferry, tried fishing the bay, the wind came up plus we had white-outs with the snow blowing. Trolled towards the cement plant and the anchored barge, nada.White caps came up so we made are way back to Glenora, which we trolled down the south side of adulphus towards Kieth's. My other buddy in his boat caught 1 5Lb. Walleye.That was it for our 7 man 3 day Quinte trip. Water temp was 37 to 38.  "
