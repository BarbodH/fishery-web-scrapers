881788,Mister G,2014-11-19 23:51:00,1429,"I just ask them ""what are you wearing and do you go both ways""......the silence is deafening and they hang up."
881791,spincast,2014-11-19 23:57:00,3279,Still my all time favourite response to a telemarketer - PG rated.  http://youtu.be/-7OgWcwgB50     
881805,GBW,2014-11-20 01:20:00,8460,"depends who's calling is how I reply...   duct cleaners ""my dad owns a duct cleaning company and if I use you he WILL kill me!""  also works for all the others too.  Scammers, yet to call me but I have a plan!  If it was computer related I would say ""great come over and fix it NOW as you must know who I am, what I look like and how to get her if you have all that other info!"""
881828,chris.brock,2014-11-20 02:58:00,4053,"I just ask them ""what are you wearing and do you go both ways""......the silence is deafening and they hang up.  Hahaha"
881648,lew,2014-11-19 10:50:00,12766,"At least that's what the woman who could hardly speak English told me on the phone last night right before I slammed the phone in her ear.  Sad that we have to put up with this garbage in our lives.  Anyways, have a great day everyone"
881649,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 10:59:00,6899,I usually try to teach them a few English words before I let them go. The sad part is that they must get enough suckers to make it worth their while.
881651,G.mech,2014-11-19 11:17:00,830,I get a little satisfaction by playing dumb......extremely dumb.  They hung up on me last time
881652,DanD,2014-11-19 11:39:00,2223,Did you call the tech line for help or was this one of those telemarketers?  Dan.
881656,lew,2014-11-19 11:51:00,12766,"Just a telemarketer Dan, or better known as a pain in the butt."
881657,muskymatt,2014-11-19 11:58:00,2608,Hmmm...infected windows. I bet that's a pane! lol  Hope you get it fixed soon
881658,wormdunker,2014-11-19 11:59:00,1711,My wife has won so many cruises - I won't see her for 3 years!!
881660,DanD,2014-11-19 12:03:00,2223,Only reason I asked is that I had an issue with my simpatico and had to call for help. The person that I was connected to couldn't speak enough clear english; that he likely would have a hard time ordering a hamburger at Micky D's. I asked to speak to someone who was in Canada; his response was he represented the Canadian help line for simpatico.  I told him I didn't care what he did I want to speak to a Canadian; which I was transferred too. A buddy that works at Bell told me to do this if I ever had an issue with the help line and it worked. EH  Dan.
881661,lew,2014-11-19 12:05:00,12766,It's tough Dan when English is sort of the universal language but it's hard to get someone who can speak it when you need help.
881662,Fishwilly,2014-11-19 12:13:00,206,"These scumbags are terrible. Called my ailing father in law (Alzheimer) and scammed him. After hounding him to do this and do that on his PC and not getting the financial info they were looking for , they conned him into giving them his CC # and got him for $700 bucks."
881669,G.mech,2014-11-19 12:45:00,830,"That is horrible.  An outfit in Phoenix AZ got my ailing father for over $20,000.  It all started with a phone call but before long they had him so convinced that they were legit that we couldn't do anything to stop it from happening.  BEWARE of USA Supreme Technology & Primetime Marketing Solutions, they are thieves who pray on the elderly and have it all figured out so they can avoid the law."
881674,Rod Caster,2014-11-19 13:15:00,5784,"Happened to my FIL. He's a perfectly capable man but is completely computer dumb.  My mom got the call, but she's a bit wiser . She told them I don't have a computer, they responded with "" yes you do.."" Hahaha"
881677,ccmtcanada,2014-11-19 13:31:00,7971,"I get those calls once every two weeks or so.  Depending on my mood I will:  1) after having them go thru their pitch I say I only have macs so how can windows be infected.  This comes after I pretend to turn on my computer....tell them my internet isn't working and hold on as I reset my modem.  Then I ask them what website to go to.  Have them repeat it over and over because I type it in wrong.  2) answer their questions with my own questions like ""where are you?  Is it nice there?  What do you like to do in your spare time? What tv shows do you watch"".  I'll even ask where they are (they always say some Canadian city)?ask the weather then check online to see if they are even close.  Them ask why did they lie to me about the weather.  3). speak Japanese to them very loudly and insert ""no engrish. you speak a japanee?""  They usually hang up on me. lol."
881684,lew,2014-11-19 14:49:00,12766,You've got waaaay more patience than me Cliff
881688,Headhunter,2014-11-19 15:36:00,5703,I got that call a while ago. The lady on the line was down right belligerent with me! (She don't know me very well!) She ended up hanging up on me! LOL HH

Yeah, I have had them call me several times.  They indicate they can see my pc and the traffic and that I have a virus....I laugh and hang up."
881702,manitoubass2,2014-11-19 16:43:00,11391,i kinda wish I got these calls.  not really but it sounds like some fun to be had
881703,OhioFisherman,2014-11-19 16:47:00,6623,My son and I usually answer phone numbers we don't recognize with screwed up/S and it's not fish under structure.
881709,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 18:19:00,6899,It is really good to hear all these stories but what I would really like to know is; what can WE do to try to protect those who are getting scammed? There must be a way to put some kind of a virus on your system so that when someone tries to access it they get shut down.  It is nice that so many of us are wise to this sort of thing but I feel sorry for the seniors that hardly know how to turn their computer on and get caught.
881719,Headhunter,2014-11-19 19:06:00,5703,"I get the ""Thank you for choosing West Jet"" call twice a week. I haven't used West Jet. Cliff, the best we can do for those who are not up on this nonsense is to talk to them as best we can. Registering them on the ""no call"" list ""could help"", but likely not. HH"
