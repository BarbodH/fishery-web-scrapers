189320,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-04-18 23:02:00,1362,What a great few days we've had...I really enjoyed that SW wind on Wednesday which ended up taking the entire ice that was in the Bay out to the main channel of the Ottawa River and went bye-bye along with 4 different docks and 2 half sunk boats throughout the day!!  Here's a few pics of the ice headin' out...  This is a pic of the river on Monday....    Wednesday around 1:30PM ...    One of the docks goin for a ride with a boat.....    This is a shot taken 45min after the 1:30PM pic just to show you guys how quick the ice started moving....    after supper....    Yesterday morning.....    FINALLY......OPEN WATER SEASON HAS ARRIVED
189321,irishfield,2008-04-18 23:04:00,26272,A patriotic dock anyhow! lol  Wish the wind would shift... the south wind is holding the ice pack in both Midland and Penetang Harbours and I can't get to Laker land.
189322,Joey,2008-04-18 23:06:00,9122,"Wow, that was quick.  Cool pics.  Thanks.  Joey"
189325,Mike01,2008-04-18 23:11:00,378,It's amazing how fast it can go with the right weather

189334,irishfield,2008-04-18 23:25:00,26272,Yep... I'm plannin on 24 or 25 and I'll be there. You've got the number.
193734,walleyemaster,2008-04-29 03:18:00,325,irish sorry i did not get to the map...on where that water fall comes from in the south arm.....but i will send you info as soon as i can...when are you going again...
193750,Maverick,2008-04-29 04:12:00,371,"That's the scary thing with the Ottawa, especially in the winter. One day there is ice and the next day you are swimming. Can't wait to get to the cottage!"
