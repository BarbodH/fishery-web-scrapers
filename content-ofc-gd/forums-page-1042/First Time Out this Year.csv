193181,Mike01,2008-04-27 23:08:00,378,"My dad and I went out to Lake of Bays today, weather was a little cool and windy but we still had fun.  We were fishing of a small island near Dwight when I got a huge hit.  I got all excited as I brought in the fish, and much to my surprise my first fish of the year was a monster OOS smallmouth.  After a quick picture back into the water it went.    We cruised around the lake for a bit trying to find some lake trout, I marked some fish but no takers.  Finaly my dad got one in 6ft of water!!  Only two fish but we still had a good time.  Mike"
193189,bassmaster4,2008-04-27 23:26:00,801,nice fish!
193388,Stoty,2008-04-28 15:18:00,2910,"Nice fish for sure! That must have put up a heck of a fight!!    (But beware....a ""few"" people on here really get their underwear in a knot about taking time to snap a picture of an OOS fish.)"
193390,Pigeontroller,2008-04-28 15:31:00,2793," Actually, its in the rules that you are supposed to ""read before posting""."
193397,Stoty,2008-04-28 15:50:00,2910,"There is nothing wrong with taking a picture of a fish you caught. If its OOS, throw it back. As far as I know, there isnt a law against taking a picture of an OOS fish.  The rule says they ""prefer if you didnt"", they dont say ""DONT post pictures"". I am assuming that they ""prefer if you didnt"", because of the few people who get all worked up about it."
193413,LeXXington,2008-04-28 16:34:00,1928,"Nice fish, ohhh hang on for the ride."
193415,KyleM,2008-04-28 16:36:00,218,"Probably prefer if ya didnt because it aint right  What the hell do I care though, Im in Alberta!  Nice OOS smalllie."
193416,Mike01,2008-04-28 16:38:00,378,"If the mods want to take it down thats fine, I have no problem with it."
193421,Stoty,2008-04-28 16:47:00,2910," What ""ain't"" right? Nothing wrong with snapping a picture of an OOS fish, as long as the fish is released."
193442,cthewrld,2008-04-28 17:53:00,99,"Try the south end of the lake for the trout.  They can usually be caught around Bigwin Island, and further south through the narrows in the South Muskoka River area.  Best of luck!  I'll catch the smallie early in July!"
193455,BillM,2008-04-28 18:43:00,17367,"I think the problem with taking a pic of a OOS fish is that it shows possession.   Personally, I don't see the harm of snapping a pic (maybe leave the fish in the net?)  Whatever you do, the important thing is to get it back into the water as quick as you can."
193471,jonnybass,2008-04-28 19:31:00,346,"I see the pic has already been removed. Such a shame as I wanted to see this monster smallie!  Like Stoty said, there's nothing wrong with what you did.  EDIT* Now I see the pic. Nice Smallie!*"
193501,Reef Runner,2008-04-28 20:17:00,981,"  As long as she was put back into the drink (and not targeted as your post infers), that smallie photo is alright.  Thanks for sharing, and taking some lumps along the way.  reefrunner"
193508,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-28 20:32:00,3761,"OOS, Out Of Season right??, good fish pal!"
193510,Mike01,2008-04-28 20:36:00,378,"Lake trout was the targeted fish, and the bass was returened to the water very quickly and swam away very strong."
193512,walleyejigger,2008-04-28 20:38:00,876,"very nice, and dark"
193619,johnnyb,2008-04-28 23:49:00,3413,Laker in 6 FOW ...not bad!  I was in the area on the weekend and had to go right to the bottom to get mine.  I haven't uploaded my laker pic 'cuz the connection at home was no good...where's the pic of your dad's fish?!
193668,Mike01,2008-04-29 01:15:00,378,its super out of focus..
193726,Master of Bait,2008-04-29 02:59:00,196,"Nice fish.  I got crunched about a year ago for an OOS fish photo.  I understand the rules, but I also get both sides of the debate, hopefully the thread doesn't go nutso over it as it's over n' done.  Just glad you did what we would all do - release it so that I can go catch it in the summer!  Good job on the surface laker too.  Now's the time.  Cheers."
