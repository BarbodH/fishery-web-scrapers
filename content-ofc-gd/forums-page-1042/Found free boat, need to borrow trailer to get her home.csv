194013,nancur373,2008-04-29 21:58:00,1211,Anyone got a trailer I can borrow for an evening to get the boat home? It's a 15' fibreglass (not a car topper). I live in Erin and the boat is in Toronto (Dixon/401)  Thanks  Curt

194077,nancur373,2008-04-29 23:10:00,1211,HAHA! No the guy bought this boat just for the trailer. So now it sits in hid driveway with no trailer or motor. She's a fixer- upper. I just need to get her home.

Oh, now that you have the boat, shouldn't you buy a trailer anyway?"
