193721,urbanangler1990,2008-04-29 02:51:00,933,noone has tried there recently?
193742,wolfville,2008-04-29 03:54:00,396,"Do let us know how you do if you go and try.... good luck. With this temperature, they might not be as active but you'll never know if you don't try."

193865,bassfighter,2008-04-29 16:27:00,366,"I have been there 4 times in the last 3 years, and yet to catch a carp , there are lots of small cat fish. A friend said they used to nail the carp , but I tried and have given up on that spot."
