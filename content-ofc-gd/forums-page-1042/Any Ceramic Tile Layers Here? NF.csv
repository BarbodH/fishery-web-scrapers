I am wondering if anyone can give me an approximate price to lay subfloor (what would you recommend for subfloor, i have 5/8 tongue and groove ply as main floor), and ceramics on 60 square feet. I have the ceramics but no grout, thinset etc. What would be a nominal charge per square feet to install the sub and tiles and grout? You can pm if need be.  Thanks,  John"
193492,charlied,2008-04-28 20:02:00,584,"I wouldn't think it would cost you all that much.  when I put down new plywood on my bathroom floor I just used that as a sub floor then put the thin set down and put some of that orange underlay that allows for some movement ( seen it on holmes on homes).  then let it dry and then put thin set over that and layed the tiles down.  For 60 square feet, I don't think you would need more than 2 bags of thin set probably.  And 1 box of grout is loads.  It your worried about putting a sub floor then my buddy put in mahogany sub floor material.  Just screw it down real good, but I thik the plywood should be fine but I am not a rpofessional...LOL.  I would think for thinset, grout and subfloor if you want it, should be around say $100 or just over maybe.  Subfloor I heard is like $15-20 for a 4x8 sheet.  My floor hasn't cracked or anything and I have some movement in my floors cause my joists are 2x6's (old house).  Get a grout sealer too, it makes a huge difference in keeping mold and stuff out of the grout.  Hope this helps."
193528,bucketmouthjohnny,2008-04-28 21:08:00,115,"Thanks Charlie, but although I am quite the handyman and licensed electrician, I do not want to do the floor. My buddy who is a tile guy is being an ###. I asked him for a ballpark figure, and he said a grand, i said you got to be kidding, than he said 900 bucks, never got a straight answer so i was wondering if there was any professional installers out here and what i should expect to pay one so professional to put in the subfloor, and install the tiles and grout, using his/hers thinset and grout which would be in the  $/sq. ft. the tiles are 13""wavy edge, so roughly 50 or so to lay."
193562,charlied,2008-04-28 22:14:00,584,"mine was just a  rough guess, haven't really priced subfloor.  But i have heard as long as your plywood is not mangled, you really don't need a subfloor.  I could be wrong thou...LOL.  I wouldn't think for 50 tiles it should cost nearly $1000, seems very high to me.  Maybe cause its a small job he charges more.  My bathroom was 26-28 tiles and very easy once I got the floor level...lol.  I have never seen that wavy tile. That should look sharp when it's done.  Alot of tile guys i use to know wouldn't  touch a small job like that, not worth there time.   For my bathroom of 26 tiles with the tile price it cost me about $140 for everything including the underlay, thinset and grout and I bought 4 extra cases.  Doing it yourself can save a ton of money...LOL .  Your in the niagara area right?  If you decide to do it yourself I could possibly help you if you want."
