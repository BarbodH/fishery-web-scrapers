193046,Mako,2008-04-27 15:49:00,25,"Hi All,  Was wondering if anyone took notice of the water temperature when they were out panfishing this opener.  We're heading out next weekend and want to know what to expect with the water levels and the temperature.  Cheers,  Aron"
193081,Sinker,2008-04-27 17:29:00,8692,"Rice was between 55-58 yesterday. Pretty slow compared to usual on the opener. Still managed enough for a good feed, but had to work for them.  Sinker"
193126,Beans,2008-04-27 21:38:00,3339,Pigeon Lake was 57*F at the shallow end of our bay (north shore) and 50*F a bit further out in the bay...  Water levels are still very high with lots of docks still under water...prob up 2 feet...
193129,Garry2Rs,2008-04-27 21:45:00,1425,I was over near Buckhorn and saw 58 degrees. Crappie were active along the wind-blown side of shallow ( 5'-6' ) bays.
193146,Sinker,2008-04-27 22:18:00,8692,"  We got ours in similar areas. Water temp started at 58 at noon, and dropped the whole time we were there. Not much, but it was colder when we left. The south shore was the coldest we saw at 55.  Sinker"
193182,fishinfool,2008-04-27 23:08:00,366,51 Degrees on the North end of Balsam. The Crappies were right where I left them last year and we got enough for a feast for the next few days and threw the rest back. It was great to get out and do some real fishing.
193250,Mako,2008-04-28 02:19:00,25,"Thanks for the replies.  I'm feeling a lot better about next weekend.  Cheers, Aron"
193309,Jer,2008-04-28 10:27:00,1426,"We found temps on Pigeon & Buckhorn anywhere from 49 to 58 F on Saturday, but couldn't find any crappie.  On Sunday, we shore fished from my buddy's marina on Chemong and got into about 100 crappie within 3 hours, mostly smaller ones, barely a keeper in the bunch. Don't know what the water temp was there."
193843,Fishnfiend,2008-04-29 14:28:00,357,48 degrees on Dalrymple on Sunday.... 50.2 degrees in the really shallow bays (not receiving wind).  No (in season) fish to be had.  Apparently Saturday was more productive...must have been warmer.
