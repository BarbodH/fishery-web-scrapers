Is it a good time of year to be fishing it? 2. What will be hitting? 3. What should I be using?  If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much."

193605,douG,2008-04-28 23:30:00,2693,"Are you in a boat, or shore-bound?  You can find steelhead / rainbow trout from shore using long rods, floats, and roe or pink woims.  I still can't come to toims with woims.  Do some googling on 'steelhead float' and see what you find.  Don't be surprised if this board comes up in your search."
193611,BillM,2008-04-28 23:37:00,17367,"The only shore fishing I've done in the LNR was late summer down at Devils Hole in the wee hours of the morning (12-4am)..  Glow in the dark spoons (helped along with a camera flash) worked great for anything down there.  Never really know what you're going to tie into, I've caught Kings, Coho's, Rainbows/Browns/Smallmouth all in one night"
193613,Pigeontroller,2008-04-28 23:39:00,2793,Both the Whirlpool and Question are good shore fishing spots. Lake run Rainbow Trout(Steelhead) will be in the river now and for a few weeks still...In the summer you can catch Smallmouth Bass in the same spots.
193622,Joey,2008-04-28 23:59:00,9122,"1.  This is the perfect time of year.  2.  Mostly hitting will be Steelhead, with the occasional Brown and maybe a pickerel.  3.  You should be using a three way swivel with weight and roe bag or minnow, or a fly if you have one.  Good luck.  Joey"
193630,charlied,2008-04-29 00:21:00,584,joey is right....but only use a 3 way swivel at Queenston drift.  You will lose so much tackle if you attemp that rig in the whirlpool.

193653,berns1019,2008-04-29 00:54:00,4,"Thanks very much for all the info, much appreciated. Will fish the shores this week and report back. (hopefully will include some nice pics!)  Thanks again, Berns"
193675,Cast Adventures,2008-04-29 01:31:00,74,"The Steelhead fishing is still very good on the Niagara River! Water temps today were 44 degrees. Smelt are in the Lower river, big time!!! From shore try casting spoons, minnow style crankbaits, plastic grubs and spinners. Float Fishing using roe, jigs and flies can be very effect in spots. Enjoy hiking around and learning the river!  Watch out for water levels to rise in the early hours of the day. If you start at 1st light, the water will be ""at the low point"" The rocks will be very slick, watch your step. By 9:30am the water levels will increase/rise to ""the high point"". Watch you gear on the shore line if your standing on a big rock to get that perfect cast  This rising, falling of water level will only be noticed above the power dams in the glen.....  Good luck!  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"
193676,Cast Adventures,2008-04-29 01:33:00,74,"The water will stay the same for the day, after 9:30am......"
