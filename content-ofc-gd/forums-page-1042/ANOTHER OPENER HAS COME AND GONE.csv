Still fun though           my new wallpaper       all i hear is my buddy yell "" look its baby jesus in the mainger, HAHA""...my buddy put his reel down in the hay and we were all cracking up....     a nice chrome hen before it was about to jump   me testing out the new rod....lite action noodle rods stand no chance on the big males, this one took a little while..i got a few looks , LOL !!!             I got a little bored so i had too, LOL !!  thrash away , thrash away, but I just love this new reel !! "

193712,MJL,2008-04-29 02:41:00,2427," Since when did Spiel own an Islander? j/k  Congrats on the new reel.  Islanders are smooth sexy workhorses.  Looks like you had a great day out.  Great catch and the fish are all beauties.  Although the fish are on the smaller size, I bet they were a blast to hook  Top Angling"
