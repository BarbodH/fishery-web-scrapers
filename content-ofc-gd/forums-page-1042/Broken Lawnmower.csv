When our lawn mower broke and wouldn't run, my wife kept hinting to me that I should get it fixed.  But, somehow I always had something else to take care of first: the truck, the car, e-mail, fishing, always something more important to me.  Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point.  When I arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors.  I watched silently for a short time and then went into the house.  I was gone only a few minutes. When I came out again I handed her a toothbrush.  ""When you finish cutting the grass,"" I said, ""you might as well sweep the driveway.""   The doctors say I will walk again, but I will always have a limp."
