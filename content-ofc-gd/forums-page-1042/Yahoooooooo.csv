Now, i'm not sure what I doing wrong...poor timing....etc...but i went out the other day, picked up a trout rod and thought that I would give roe and berkley trout worms a try...nothin...  Maybe it's just Bronte....   So I think i'll try another river...  Anyone have suggestions?  Dave"
193863,KyleM,2008-04-29 16:21:00,218,Trout are scared of cops. Quit the force and you will be blessed with many fish.
193868,Greencoachdog,2008-04-29 16:44:00,8163,Cut back on the amount of pepper spray attractant!
193871,largemouth,2008-04-29 17:04:00,112,use your gun..........
193874,Marko,2008-04-29 17:26:00,854,"If you enjoy fly fishing you can try elora gorge, there is some nice browns swimming in there. You can also try Credit or Humber river, they are not as far from Kitchener as some other places. I`ve never fished neither one of those rivers for trout so i cant really help you with specific areas. Sorry"
