I don't know many areas and if someone wouldn't mind teaching me a few things would be appreciated. I can drive and pick you up. I'm off Fri, Sat, Sun so either day would be good.  Thanks guys,  Curt"

I don't know where to fish though but if you want to get together and try some places, I was asking around and some of the tribs to Georgian Bay were where I was planning on going. Let me know here or PM me."
