193609,BillM,2008-04-28 23:34:00,17367,"Looks like I'll be one of the first volunteers out on the water helping the MNR with their Lake Simcoe Muskellunge Restoration Project!!  Talk about being excited, it's like being a little kid on Xmas Eve.  I'll bring along the camera (After checking with my MNR guide of course)  but it should be a fun day out on the water.  Weather for Wednesday looks good, 8 degree's and sunny.  Perhaps this will be my best learning experience when it comes to muskies yet!  (This coming a close second to our one and only Lew  ).   I will try to keep my mouth shut (somewhat) and my ears open.  Hopefully I'll have some pics for you guys Wed night!"
193614,Clampet,2008-04-28 23:42:00,1947,"Muskies in Simcoe, eh! Along with Pike?"
193616,Pigeontroller,2008-04-28 23:48:00,2793,Good to see the enthusiasm Bill! I'll be out there helping on May 14th.  Muskie can co-exist with Pike...They've been doing it for thousands of years...
193618,irishfield,2008-04-28 23:49:00,26272,Remember Bill... leave your Team #5 Logo at home !!
193621,BillM,2008-04-28 23:54:00,17367,My plan has been foiled!
193642,Smokey,2008-04-29 00:35:00,1278,Hey Bill  Have fun out there. I'll be watching for the report and hopefully pics when you return.  Mike
