41618,cisco,2007-03-01 17:58:00,597,Thank you. You're a wealth of useful information......... Red an' white Daredevil under a float? LOL! I have recently bought about 6 Woodies since they're supposed to work good tracking just above the lake's weedlines. Tried em on my favorite lake with no results yet. I try and fish a lake names Stoney just north of Peterborough here in Ontario. Haven't caught anything to speak of in season there yet.  But I'm working on it!
41655,wuchikubo,2007-03-01 19:11:00,1114," Bob,  Now that's probably why! I don't do much trolling as I don't have my own boat (yet)! Mostly casting, I am waiting for the time when one of my casts and retrieves will spark a nice 'ski to give my muskie rod (Abu black max with a Abu ambassador 5500) a work out. Thanks and I am grateful for your insight.  Stan"
41659,muskiebobsr,2007-03-01 19:19:00,49,"Just keep fishing it will happen you need to pay your due's you know.  You new at the game should pick up a copy of my book Catching Musking and The Rules of Muskie Fishing.  Even though I wrote it, I know it is a good  book.  It is all the different ways to catch Muskie and what with.  LOL  Bob  Good Fishing."
40395,bigfish1965,2007-02-26 23:18:00,3382,"Rob Brunner signed up to the site I noticed. Wow. Rob is in the Freshawater Fishing Hall of Fame and is a very well known author and ambassador for the sport. He's also likely the oldest member here...82 and still hunting musky! We're very priviledged to have you here, sir!"
40404,GbayGiant,2007-02-26 23:33:00,1780,"That's funny I had no idea who he was,( I will give myself a history lesson on your stats ) when he responded to a few post saying he's been casting for muskies for 75 years, I was like what ?   unbelievable, I was thinking to myself how old is this guy.   It's great to see you still love the sport after so manny years Rob, congrats."
40408,DT10Sam,2007-02-26 23:38:00,480,Welcome aboard Rob.  Now Lew has someone to try and keep up to.  Best regards Sam
40423,Roy,2007-02-27 00:01:00,13728,"I was blown away by the people he has met. (see 'brush with greatness' thread)  You sir, are one of those individuals with whom I would have lunch and a great chat afterwards."
40424,wuchikubo,2007-02-27 00:02:00,1114,"Welcome to the OFC family Rob, I hope one day i'll be able to learn something from you to help me catch my first muskie.  Best Regards, Stan"
40426,silveradosheriff,2007-02-27 00:03:00,1025,"Hey Roy, how does he know that your chat would be great?  Hehehe"
40435,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 00:19:00,49,"Thanks for the welcome fellows.  I have been fishing Lake St Clair since one Sunday in June of 1929.  I have been guiding casting for Muskie for years and still do.  I'm booking for this year.  I have the next 3 weekends of shows to do.  As posted elsewhere BPS this next week and Then Lansing followed by Grand Rapids. I'm doing seminars in Lansing and Grand Rapids.  Do any of you have a copy of my book ""Casting Anchor Bay""  ? or Fishing LAke St Clair?  Collector items by the way.  This is a great lake we have here.  I know some of you fellows.  That line up of famous Generals was because of WWII of course.  So was Betty Grable and Hedy Lamar along with Ester Williams.  I almost became a Canadian back in 1958.  I was up at Elliot Lake helping to build the town.  If you get a chance come on over to BPS this Saturday or Sunday and say Hi.  Good Fishing.  Bob  P.S.  By the way I caught my first Muskie in 1931  RGB"
40436,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 00:22:00,49,Gbaygiant.  You take me fishing and I'll take you. LOL  Bob
40437,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 00:23:00,49,It is a pleasure to come to this site and read the different post each day.  Keep it up and take a kid fishing.  Bob  Good Fishing.  bob
40438,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 00:28:00,49,HearingFish.  The best way to catch a fish is Homer's way speed troll.  The way to go for a lot of fish.  Not the best way to catch a truely big fish though.  Bob
40442,GbayGiant,2007-02-27 00:41:00,1780," Hey Bob, any time youngster.  I'm just a young pup at 26 years old, but if your ever thinking of taking another trip to fish Georgian Bay, we could go out and you could show me your tricks, I'm in between the Moon river and French river, it's a trophy stretch of water for muskie but like I said before the numbers are hard to come by maybe with your expertise we could find a couple."
40516,TJQ,2007-02-27 03:39:00,7806,Welcome aboard!!
40523,sonny,2007-02-27 03:51:00,511,"Welcome aboard!!!,,,maybe just maybe you would be the greatness to which someone else brushes...fish forever my friend!"
40542,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 04:55:00,49,"Thank You Sonny.  I want to fish Clair for 100 years and this is # 78, only 22 more to go. It should be easy.  I have 4 stents in my heart so it should pump for that long. Also if the old saying is true that the big guy gives you an extra day for ever day you fish I have it wrapped up for sure.  Good Fishing .  Bob"
40546,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 05:19:00,49,I know Gbaygiant.  But God they are big.   Bob  Here are a couple of shots of Homers basement.  Homer and Capt. Hank Bradley and I were fishing on Captain Don Millers boat in July of 1990 6 days before Homers 89th Birtday.  We were taping a show for the Master Angler Show. (Oakland County Cable) Hank - Homer - I  that day had combined 181 years of fishing Lake St Clair.  Homer and I both put fish in the boat.  Then we quit taping and told Hank he didn't have enough time on the water to rate being on the Show.  He only had 58 years.  LOL  
40552,GbayGiant,2007-02-27 06:29:00,1780," What a rookie.  lol.   Bob, Just wondering the story behind Homers SWIM WHIZZ lures ? how did the Believer and Swim Whiz end up almost identical. They are both in my tackle box and I like them both, but I've always wondered why they are so similar and what one was around first  ?  and if they use to be made from wood ? (I think a wood one would be amazing ) what do you think ?"
40556,muskiebobsr,2007-02-27 08:07:00,49,The believer is a copy (Really a steal)  of the Swimm Whizz.  The first Whizzs were made of wood.  I liked the straight Whizz mush more than the straight Believer but I caught more fish on the jointed Believer than on the Swimm Whizz.  I used to have a wooden one hanging around the house.  I'll see if I can find it and Post it here.
40557,Roy,2007-02-27 09:18:00,13728,And the man even gets up at a decent time in the morning too!
40558,motv8tr,2007-02-27 09:26:00,2587,"Welcome to the board Bob, looking forward to reading about your Musky adventures, I'm still waiting to catch my first one...  Maureen"
41058,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-28 10:06:00,621,"Welcome Bob to OFC Homer Leblanc,now there's the teacher of all teachers ,might have very well been one of the few that did not tell tall tales of WR fish that is Still have his book,a disciple of the method If he were still around,I'd tell him ""Keep your feet off the varnish""  If you see Don,say Hi for me Tell him ,I am getting older but I still eats me pie Neat shot there   marc"
41123,Beans,2007-02-28 15:50:00,3339,Welcome Rob...  Geeeze you make Nanook (72) ands me (71) seem like pups...  We used to be the old farts of the board...
41465,muskiebobsr,2007-03-01 08:22:00,49,Thanks Jed  and Beans.  This is a nice site.  I have enjoyed reading it.  Good fishing.  Bob
41523,cisco,2007-03-01 13:35:00,597,Nice to have your knowledge and experience here.  I never fished Lake St Clair but remember an article in Field and Stream or another outdoors mag back in the 60's or early 70's of guys chasing a reported 7 fter there. As a young lad I sure was wide-eyed about that story!  Mind saying what's the biggest you've seen/tangled with in St Clair?  Do you fish other lakes here in Ontario?
41587,muskiebobsr,2007-03-01 16:38:00,49,The biggest fish I have caught in St Clair was a 136 pound Sturgeon.  The biggest Muskie I saw last year in the North Channel was nearly 60 inches.  Had a client 2 years ago nailed a 57 inch fish on one of my Brunner Runner's.  I caught one way back in 1947 that weighed 48.10.  With the White Fish that came back to the lake last year we will have world class fish in the matter of no more than 5 years.  A 46 1/2 inch fish was caught last year that weighed 36 1/2 pounds.  That was a fat fish.  A fellow caught a fish in November that was only 45 inches and it scaled at 31 pounds on the digital scale.  It really was fat.  Good Fishing.   Bob  P.S.  I know you want to know what lures they caught them on. LOL
41600,fishindevil,2007-03-01 17:03:00,6254,"welcome aboard sir,  you will love it here and im sure that we can all learn alot from you and we are glad to have you as part of our family here at OFC, so enjoy....cheers    shawn"
