41843,irishfield,2007-03-01 23:43:00,26272,Thanks! I've got a customer that's suppose to be flying in from Colorado tomorrow... with a 4:30pm Friday arrival... and then supposed to drive up here on Saturday Am. Already warned him to check really close with his airline before leaving home. I'm not leaving the laneway!
