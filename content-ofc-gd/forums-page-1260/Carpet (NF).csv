42095,fishdawg,2007-03-02 14:39:00,912,"Jeff - do yourself a favour & get the 10mm or greater underpad  - i briefly was in the industry - too many cheaped out with the 8,   - it does make a difference  another thing i learned  - limit going barefoot on the carpet   - oils from feet ruin it in a coupla months"
42099,Sherriff,2007-03-02 14:47:00,252," Thanks, will for sure keep that 10mm my limit.  Good call on the foot oils....Nasty.  Thanks"

42174,Fishnfiend,2007-03-02 18:12:00,357,Didn't know that about foot oils.  Do any of the 'treated' carpets stand (unintentional punn) up any better to them?
42179,fishdawg,2007-03-02 18:18:00,912,"i dont know FF the fella i worked with had been in the industry for 25+ yrs  he said it didnt matter the matterial or colour he also told me never to get carpet proffesionally cleaned  all at once - reason being thatwhen you do, the manufacturers protectent would get removed  - instead he said to ""spot clean""  - this is only what ive been told, not my own own personal theory"
