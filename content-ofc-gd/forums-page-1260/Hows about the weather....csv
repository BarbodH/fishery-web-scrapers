41745,huntervasili,2007-03-01 20:43:00,1604,Still snowing pretty hard here in burlington... 10 cms on the ground  and it looks like there is an accident on hwy 5 cause traffic is backed up all the way to brant... Just a heads up if you are in the area...

41761,SlowPoke,2007-03-01 21:10:00,2984,"Oh, lucky me... I have to drive 714 km in this sh.. stuff tonight. Maybe I'll bring my camara tonight and do an ""ice report"" LOL..... I usually see 10-15 wipeouts on a night like this. Most of them tend to be car parts haulers, garbage haulers and over confident SUV owners. -Brian"
41762,irishfield,2007-03-01 21:17:00,26272,Startin to snow up here...just hope the wind stays out of the south and doesn't change to from the north.... to pick up all that open water out on GBay...and dump it on us.
41774,Gerritt,2007-03-01 21:38:00,6129,"I just got back.... man are the roads a MESS! not to mention the dumb dumb drivers out there... took me 45 minutes to get to Vaughan and 3.5 Hours to get back home.... People out there are nuts!! SUVs and cars driving the shoulders of the highways, people without their full lighting system on in white out conditions, people driving through stop signs and red lights (yes I mean driving not sliding)  I hope everyone that had to go out today makes it home safely as well as their loved ones...  The highways are gonna be nuts today thanks to a train derailment in Pickering.. So that means no via or GO train service for awhile...  Freezing rain here on Hamilton Mountain ATM.   Gerritt."
41776,Garyv,2007-03-01 21:42:00,547,"Freekin sloppy mess North of Sarnia where I live.  I have about 2"" of slush on the drive with the trees loaded with ice.  Still windy with a driving rain, sleet, snow mix."

41789,tbayboy,2007-03-01 22:02:00,1497,"Decided to leave the office (yonge & sheppard) early today when it was coming down sideways.  Still took 1/2 hour to get from sheppard to john street, never got past second gear.  Heading out to shovel now."
41794,douG,2007-03-01 22:18:00,2693,"I bailed from work around 2:30, and told my staff to hit the road.  I had no difficulties, as most were driving smart with vehicles well spaced.  The 403  eastbound was moving at 40 - 50 km/Hr, but there were no issues, safe and sound at home in about 45 minutes, only double regular travel time.  Now the kinders are safe at home as well, pollo pizzaiole in the oven, wood fireplace is lit, all is well with this winter world."
41795,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 22:26:00,455," Good to hear Doug, I am glad that everyone made it home ok!"

41645,huntervasili,2007-03-01 18:59:00,1604,"Burlington has been getting snow for about 45 mins or so... roads are covered pretty good, hopefully no one needs to do any driving out there but if you do be careful... No ice pellets yet but we are expecting it. What are you all getting now? anyone have ice coming down yet?"
41647,wuchikubo,2007-03-01 19:04:00,1114,"In Markham/Unionville,  Zip, nadda, but the sky is starting to get darker. Roads are white from all the salt on the road, but it's dry.  HearingFish"
41648,irishfield,2007-03-01 19:05:00,26272,Looking at the radar....London/Kitchener are getting hammered right now! Nothing up here in Penetang other than a STRONG wind out of the south.
41649,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 19:05:00,455,Nothing for us yet out here in Oshawa.   But it is coming...........

I'm working from home today cause I anticipated the afternoon rush to be horrible.  I was thinking of taking the GO train, but with the derailment of that freight train, I'm glad I stayed at home!"
41654,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 19:10:00,455,"Yeah Cliff you are lucky you stayed home today. Poor guy, you would have been swearing and cursing the whole way home.LOL"

41662,lew,2007-03-01 19:20:00,12767,"It's coming down real heavy in East York now and I was just outside and heard thunder booming too. We went from nothing to heavy snow in about 15 minutes. Freezing rain is sposed to hit about 6:00  Gonna be a nasty night folks, so be real careful if your out driving anywhere."
41665,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 19:25:00,455,"Wow, Lew thanks for the heads up on how bad you have it right now."
41667,lew,2007-03-01 19:27:00,12767,"It's moving fast fishergirl, so it should be on your doorstep any minute now."
41668,fishforfun,2007-03-01 19:27:00,105,"Like Lew said when it hit it was fast, white outs here in Georgetown."
41674,MJL,2007-03-01 19:35:00,2427,It's going hard here in Scarborough...I'm dreading the trip downtown tonight for my mid-term exam.  Why did it have to snow today?
41679,Joey,2007-03-01 19:41:00,9122,It started in Richmond Hill about 1/2 an hour ago and its BAD!.  Roads already covered and the wind is ferocious.  Joey
41680,blaque,2007-03-01 19:41:00,2419,"way down here in Olcott NY. Just had a 5 minute whip of flurries, and thats it, looks like its gonna be all rain here by the time the precip settles over us. At least according to the doppler pattern."
41681,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 19:42:00,455,"Great, I was just talking to work, and I was wondering if we were even going to open tonight, and they were not aware of the weather that is comming!!!!!! I told them and they might not even open tonight. I am shocked they never heard, it shows that some people do not pay attention. I just went outside and it will be here very shortly Lew. The sky is getting darker, snow is starting to fall and the wind is picking up and getting real cold."
41687,just herb,2007-03-01 19:48:00,7,Nothing happening in Lindsay as yet. Please keep the storm where it is. :roll  eyes:
41688,Rippinlips,2007-03-01 19:51:00,16,"Whitby just started getting hammered this minute, cant see across the street."
41689,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 19:53:00,455," Well there, it should be here ANY moment, thanks for the warning Rippinlips!"
41692,Rattletrap2,2007-03-01 19:56:00,1652,"Bad here in Brampton right now too! I just came in from driving the short distance between Airport Rd. and Bovaird drive to Hwy 10 and Bovaird Drive. It got progressively worse from there to here.  I just had 24 guys in from across Canada for a training session this week. They found out there flights were cancelled for tonight (already!) and most managed to get earlier flights booked. The guys driving back to London, Windsor, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Rochester, NY, and Marrietta, Ohio are the ones I worry most about. They all bugged out early to try and outrun it, but I think the majority are heading straight into the mess.  Strangely enough, this sort of thing has happened a couple of years ago when these same folks were here. They had to stay over a couple of extra days before they got to head home.  I have a Carribean cruise starting on Saturday morning. All I need to do is get in the air and I'm outta here! LOL Seems like a good time to be heading someplace warm!"
41694,ccmtcanada,2007-03-01 19:57:00,7971, Yep...in South Whitby....after reading your post I took a look outside...and guess what?  It's snowing!!!
41695,Rippinlips,2007-03-01 19:57:00,16,"no problem fishergirl,   i have a BASS club meeting tonight but im stayin in and stayin warm   , still snowing and the wind is now picking up."
41697,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 19:59:00,455,"I don't blame you Rippinlips!, I am debating on whether I should get ready for work tonight or what. I take it the board will be busy tonight.LOL"
41703,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 20:03:00,455,"Ok, we have it now here in Oshawa, and it looks NASTY   and the wind is really picking up. What can we expect later tonight? Will it get worse or stay the same?"
41705,lunkerbasshunter,2007-03-01 20:04:00,2585,just drove 2 1/2 hours form welland to oakville.  it was bad everywhere but really really intense from stoney creek around the hammer to oakville.  Glad im home now!  Cheers!
