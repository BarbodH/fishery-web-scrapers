41294,Clampet,2007-03-01 00:02:00,1947,"Tha calm B4 The Storm. Headed out to my spot close to Innisfil Beach. Got set-up with Tarpus Minimus by 10:40 A.M. Had A North by North East Wind.. only about 5-10 Km / hour, so it wasn't too bad. After about 20 minutes and one small Perch, decided to move shallower, walked about 40 feet, and drilled my second hole. 3 Perch later and another 20 minutes decided to move a little shallower by walking another 15 paces. Drilled my third hole, and within 2 minutes caught another Perch, then nothing for 15 minutes.  Walked another 20 paces drilled my 4th hole, and this was the spot, as I caught one after another.  I was also rewarded with a nice sized Whitefish, which I guesstimate to be around 5lbs.  About 1/2 hour b4 leaving I received some unexpected company, some hopefull anglers who decided to fish in my holes I had cut earlier.  B4 I left I advised the lady to fish in my productive hole, and she immediately began getting hits.   Here is the catch...    "
