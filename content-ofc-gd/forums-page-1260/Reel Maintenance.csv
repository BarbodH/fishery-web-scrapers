My Daiwa spinning reels have stainless steel and felt washers, which are fairly dirty.  I'm wondering if a simple cloth wipe-down is fine for the felt, and if felt and stainless drag washers should be greased?  Also, to all who do their own servicing, is it a terrible idea to disassemble the reel body to clean the spool shaft within?  I unfortunately do not have reel schematics, though I have e-mailed Daiwa for a copy."
41831,tjsa,2007-03-01 23:20:00,1578,"Yes, just wipe them down, clean out any gunk. Lube the gears and shafts though. And, for schematics, go to:  http://www.mikesreelrepair.com/  Lots of schematics for many manufacturers there.  You should have a reel schematic for Daiwa when you bought the reel, unless it was bought second hand. Every Daiwa reel I have bought came with a schematic, and part number sheet."
41868,BabyHerc,2007-03-02 00:37:00,285,"Thanks TJSA for the link.  My reels did come with the schematic sheet, but that was about 5 years ago, and they have since been misplaced.  So no grease on the drag washers?  edit:  hmmmmm, dead link.  Maybe he shut the site down?  I'll keep trying anyway."

I thought that I had at least a slight grasp on posting in messageboards, but for the life of me I could not the place to enter my comments.  There certainly are a bunch of options available for formatting the text, however, and I can only believe that with choices come complexity.  My choice to marry my wife added complexity to my life, so I guess that proves the theory.  If this is the place, I am truly amazed at my lucky guess.  Perhaps the lottery is is order.  Now to my extemely anemic post:  I tried the link and it worked.    Sorry that you had to suffer through the rest of this.  Roy"

I guess he needed the money more than I did.  In the mean time if you're looking for schematics, try: The Reel Doctor  -Brian"
