41783,tomkat,2007-03-01 21:52:00,246,Hello all I finally re registered on the new board it looks great. Heading down to Amelia Island Florida and was wondering if anyone has fished there and what they caught. Thought I might toss a few shrimp in and see what happens.

Good luck, I was just in Florida last week and had a great time fishing, went on a couple of bass lakes and then fished from a dock in Melbourne.  Mike"
