42153,lew,2007-03-02 17:28:00,12767," Yeah, as a matter of fact I do follow !!  Go back and read my post, all I said was I don't know how anyone could slaughter such a beautiful animal....how is that hard to understand ??  What's that got to do with eating muskies or anything else ??  Guess from now on if we want to express an opinon around here about something, we'd better post the question 1st and see if our opinions meet everybodies satisfaction......"
42154,troutologist,2007-03-02 17:30:00,951, All the things Ive read regarding opening up the west of North America couger was a prized meat by the frontier folk. Granted that was a long time past and hunting couger for sustience is not plausible due to the low reproductive success of them or any other large carivore.  That aside thats about the biggest one Ive seen a picture of Im thinking getting around 175-200lbs??
42155,blaque,2007-03-02 17:33:00,2419,"I do not  hunt , never shot an animal......but i do have a few gung ho hunter friends. I understand the whole population control thing. I Think. Sort of. Theres two issues i have with this instance in particular however.........the consumption of the animal is something i think is necassary after taking it from the wild.........and Im sorry, but i dont think a cat is very tasty sounding lol. Not to mention a cat that age and size. But true, he may have harvested the animal for consumption. Secondly and even more so, however, ...... from the pictures, .....and really the last one......I dunno, i just think its borderline classless and tacky the way he's posing for the shot where hes holding the cat. Again, were all just here to gab and spout our opinions, which is harmless i think. And thats my opinion. And no I dont have any fish mounted on my wall by the way lol.  As far as the population control thing,.......why is it, and im not trying to be a smartie here lol, but why is it i can go into the most remote areas of B.C or anywhere really, and theres thriving wildlife everywhere, where there are no hunts going on whatsoever. No animals eating themselves  to starvation, and again, this is something I just dont get and im sure theres a reason, seriously just asking the question. Hope it doesnt come off as offensive."
42158,Puckhead,2007-03-02 17:38:00,377," Right, so why are you continuing to berate him for his opinion then? Same with the war vet above, guy states that he fought for the right, and then pisses on someone for using their right to state their opinion.  That makes sense.  I don't see the point of ""sport"" hunting either... Is that ok to say - or should I expect a lecture?"
42160,JustinHoffman,2007-03-02 17:41:00,482,"No different than those folk that have fish mounts on the wall - the animal wasn't consumed in that case either.  How many of us have an issue with the dead cougar, yet have a dead muskie on the wall?  Hands up, folks...  I myself don't hunt, but have nothing against it.  But when sportsmen attack or criticize other legal ways of the land, it's what gives the P3TA folk the ammunition they desire. Divide and conquer the sportsman, and our favourite outdoor activities (including fishing) will become a thing of the past.  Good Fishing or Hunting, Justin"
42163,Hellfish,2007-03-02 17:43:00,308,"I think u should expect a lecture, seems to be the consensus here everyone claims they can have their own opinion and get ticked on it when they say their own opinion, thats classic for forums though. I mean i cant even shoot a damn bird nm a cougar like that, oh well good luck and have fun people."
42168,Fishnfiend,2007-03-02 18:01:00,357, Well said.
42175,muskiebobsr,2007-03-02 18:15:00,49,You better learn how to read. I didn't direct it at anybody I said we all have a right to opinion.. I don't agree with your opinion and don't agree with mine and that is fine.  You don't feed me and I you so lets go fishing.
42177,douG,2007-03-02 18:17:00,2693,"If you are willing to offer your opinion, then you must accept that someone will disagree with you.  It's not rocket science.  Suck it up already."
42181,Puckhead,2007-03-02 18:23:00,377, You're telling him not to have an opinion...  that's all I was pointing out.  But I guess it is your opinion to not want him to have an opinion in which in my opinion I felt it was hypocritical in which in your opinion you felt that my opinion of your opinion of him not having an opinion wasn't a valid opinion.... ahhh forget it - I'm confused.
42183,Fishnfiend,2007-03-02 18:27:00,357,"I am against protesting, but don't know how to show it..."
42184,Whopper,2007-03-02 18:36:00,2174," Not to change the subject but this statement is just not true, I have two bass mounts and harvested the meat from both. Many people don't realize that this can be done.  Whopper"
42188,DT10Sam,2007-03-02 18:56:00,480," Not to highjack this thread but Whopper is right.  You can harvest the meat from fish that are being mounted.  I know as I have done taxidermy for many years and I have had many fish show up and I would immediately skin them and place the skin in the tanning solution while I prepared dinner with the fillets. Of course I was selective on which fish I would enjoy.  I am a hunter and fisherman and lately I have been more of a conservationist since I have not shot any deer in at least 5 years or anything for that matter and now I have gotten back into fishing so most of my year will be doing exactly that fishing.  I do see both sides to this issue and will stay neutral as there will always be feelings that come into play here and I value Lew as a good friend. Sometimes opinions are exactly that and when they are worded differently it can cause some hurt. I would ask everyone to please be sensitive to each other and hopefully we can all stay as a family on this great messageboard.  Kind regards, Sam"
42193,Terry,2007-03-02 19:16:00,14456,"I don't hunt much anymore.. but in almost every case, they set quotas because the population needs culling or to maintain a certain number of animals in any given area..... that's why in many areas you can get many deer tags for the same season....... if it was a legal hunt, then no problem he has the right to do it and if he didn't do it ,likely, a car or truck would have done  it or it would be killed by the MNR to reduce numbers.......  and the cycle of life goes on"
42195,Northhunter,2007-03-02 19:22:00,214," Bear roast is awesome. Kinda like the most tender, mild tasting (but flavourful) beef you'll ever have. I've been told Lynx is amazing, I don't see why cougar would be any different.  I don't get this board sometimes. Impaling fish for pure enjoyment is fine but got forbid you use anything but a rod (the spearfishing vids), hold it incorrectly, kill one and eat it, or (IMO) act more humanely towards a mammal in the act of hunting."
42203,keram,2007-03-02 19:40:00,585,"Generaly I do not comment on the opinions ( prefer facts). And fact is that cougars can be hunted legally in Alberta http://www.albertahunt.com/cougar.htm I do not hunt myself, but I can understand hunters and almost all anglers The bottom line is: is it what you want to do?, whatever you want to do - is it legal? If it is legal go ahead and enjoy Do not discuss ( question ) ethics, because it is pointles. What for one is unethical, can be perfectly acceptable for the other ( and it will work backward if we change the subject)"
42207,Roy,2007-03-02 19:50:00,13728,"Time to make the doughnuts....  This was to be a thread about cougars. Instead, we've learned that everyone has the right to his/her opinion. This is really working out well.  Next topic?"
41895,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 01:43:00,1780,"My friend emailed these pics, I don't have the story but it's a big cat from Alberta near Grande Cache, to bad it was killed, I'm guessing they are rare but I wouldn't want to be wondering around the woods with this Cougar, the local bar will do.       "
41896,huntervasili,2007-03-02 01:45:00,1604,Now thats a big Cat.... by couger I thought you meant... well nevermind...
41901,lunkerbasshunter,2007-03-02 01:48:00,2585,yeah i was waiting for something else other then a real cat.
41905,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 01:56:00,1780," Ya, type I love Cougars into Google and take a gander at what comes up, I couldn't imagine.  Kids don't try that at home."
41911,Frankypro,2007-03-02 02:03:00,63,"Well, I've never!  the last pics drives it home for me.  all I can say."
41913,lilkynan,2007-03-02 02:04:00,173,Cougers - smoke and talk and drink at the same time - dont they???  Nice cat!!!!!!
41925,Roy,2007-03-02 02:21:00,13728," When you posted that, 53 members dropped off the board for a coupla minutes...."
41931,fishindevil,2007-03-02 02:36:00,6254,"yes thats a good one..  ...when i read your topic,i thought oh-no,,  ,,whats this thread all about...well im glad you cleared that up for us...lol..lol too bad about the real cougar,can they hunt them,i dont know,they sure are a very majestic cat thats for sure......cheers"
41956,Joey,2007-03-02 03:16:00,9122,What a shame!  Joey
41960,Weeds,2007-03-02 03:24:00,782,All I can say is he better eat it!
41962,joonmoon,2007-03-02 03:30:00,528,I'm not a domestic cat luver but that beast is awesome. Seen them before and been up close to one in a cage that was a lot smaller. When they purr its sounds like thunder rolling in the distance. A majestic beast for sure.
41990,highdrifter,2007-03-02 05:32:00,2534,"Wow that's a big... Mountain Lion!  While I'm usually the first to say Better the cat goes before some child dissapears, it would seem out of place here.  Such an amazing animal, taken from its wild splendor, killed by ignorance and greed.  Bumer.  Still, thanx for posting John.  tight loops"
41992,muskiebobsr,2007-03-02 06:26:00,49,Very nice cat. I did hunt them a couple of times about 65 years ago.  I still hunt but more with then camera the with the bow or gun.  Got a black bear in 1961 with my bow that dressed at 415 lbs.  The next day in the same area I shot a great 16 point buck.  Not to change the subject but on opening day of the Trout season in Mi. the last Saturday in April of 1946 I caught a 7 1/4 pound Brown Trout on a streamer I tied myself.  That same year on his fly rod my Dad on June the 20th the opening day of Bass season in Mi. then My Dad caught a 9 lb. 3 oz.  Small Mouth in Little Fisher Lake. it is part of the Glenn Lake Chain. I think of these things ever now and then.  Hope you all don't mind me rambling like this.  Good Fishing.  bob
42017,DT10Sam,2007-03-02 11:41:00,480,"I was informed that I can only love the 4 legged cougars and the cougar that I have here at home  Regards, Sam"
42034,lew,2007-03-02 12:31:00,12767,I  could never understand why anyone would want to slaughter such a beautiful creature.  Pretty pathetic if you ask me.
42035,huey graphite,2007-03-02 12:32:00,362,   HA HA hA!  That was hilarious Roy!    (you're kidding right?)
42055,blaque,2007-03-02 13:40:00,2419," My sentiments exactly Lew.......Ill never comprehend it. I think it compares to the middle aged guy who buys the Hummer or the Corvette just to ""prove himself"" to society or make up for other ""shortcomings"""
42071,troutologist,2007-03-02 14:03:00,951,"Though its never nice to see an animal like that killed, bear in mind in a place like Alberta where cougers are quite plentiful hunting plays an important role in keeping the population in check. what happened in California when then banned hunting for them...attacks and incidents in the city increased many fold. thus opens the can o worms"
42102,Fishnfiend,2007-03-02 14:56:00,357,"I agree troutologist.  Too many people are quick to jump on the beautiful creature/nasty human bandwagon.  Then go out and purposely hook fish, only to let 'em go with an extra hole or two in their face... Let's get the real story on why that animal was harvested before we get on our soapboxes, folks."
42117,Tacklebuster,2007-03-02 15:51:00,303,"I hunt and fish, so I am deffinately not jumping on the tree hugging band wagon.  However,  I believe you should only take game which you are going to consume.  As such I will never hunt black bear.  The exception of course is self defence, and if you are a farmer who needs to protect his herd.  I was also under the impression that cougars were a protected."
42119,lew,2007-03-02 15:53:00,12767," I'm not on a soap box, and was stating my opinion, if you don't like my opinion, that's tough !!!!  I also hate bull fighting, leg hold traps  and  the British fox hunts too......is that OK with you ??"
42123,muskiebobsr,2007-03-02 16:03:00,49,"I don't believe that the bleeding hearts have no idea of how wrong they are about not harvesting animals.  If it wasn't for hunting there would be no Deer in the woods to look at for one example.  In this day and age left alone they would stave themselves out of house and home so to speak.  I'm to old for any of you to scare me out of my joy of being in the woods.  I really don't care if I kill an animal any more but I wil die protecting my right to hunt for it.  I fought a war to protect this right but also their right to complain.  No ones says you have to hunt but leave the ones that enjoy it alone.  This is the way I feel and I don't need to hear from any one how wrong this is, because I'm just as stubborn as you are.  Take care.  Good Fishing.  Bob"
42145,Hellfish,2007-03-02 17:02:00,308,"Just a question but can u eat a cougar?? I agree with most hunting is a great outdoors sport and such but to kill a cat like that and then just use it as a trophy, is not anything I would do or agree with. itz like saying cause polars bears are getting pushed south b/c of melting caps and glaciers so when they get into land it would be ok to kill them cause they are there now?? I dunno thats preety sad to see that though. Just my opinion though."
42146,Fishnfiend,2007-03-02 17:07:00,357,"Wow, relax Lew.  You can freely state your opinion as I can share mine.  I didn't see any pictures of the guy in cuffs, so I guess what he did was legal...  When was the last time a musky fisherman ate a musky?  Sure, there's no catch and release in hunting, but there is also a certain amount of mortality in released fish.  Do you follow?  My $0.02  Come on softwater season.  This snow and ice is making me crusty.  Bottom line - That's is one awesome animal. I'd love to have that mounted for my den!"
42150,huey graphite,2007-03-02 17:20:00,362, You too are entitled to your opinion but you made it personal with the soapbox comment. Let's keep it cordial eh?
