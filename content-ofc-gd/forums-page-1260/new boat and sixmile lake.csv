39877,kennyman,2007-02-25 19:08:00,737,"Welcome. You got a Legend 18 extreme eh?   Very nice for a first boat! Did you buy it at the Toronto Spring Fishing show? I'm very,very jealous."
40369,keith,2007-02-26 22:20:00,15,hello sorry about no intro/ not aware of that/thanks for heads up. basically i;m passionate  about fishing and the the outdoors  and will base boat at port severn .. yes  /  I  bought boat at fishing show /got great  deal  but of course had to upgrade as 50hp was not really adequate..seems like a great set up/ I'm     primarily fish and release and photo .. I  thought on looking on older charts that there were few shallow entries  to 6 mile lakefrom  gloucester pool but may be oudated. hopefully there are still some nice bass in these lakes thanks for all responses . flyer
40398,irishfield,2007-02-26 23:21:00,26272,Do the James Bond thing and give her hell coming out of the pool and you might make it up the hill and over the road into Six Mile...  Congrats on the new ride!
40401,GbayGiant,2007-02-26 23:27:00,1780,"Welcome aboard. Can't give you to much advice, but I fished both those areas a couple times with good results, some nice fish, have no idea if you can boat from one to the other though, unless you follow Wayne's advice."
40678,keith,2007-02-27 16:26:00,15,"thanks for info on no access to 6 mile lake/ not sure if my insurance co will be very understanding if I try the big jump but it  would make a great accident report.. glad to hear there is good fishing/plan to go Fishing  Depot nr the  toronto airport  and p/u maps of area,apparently  Adventure Maps who produce  maps check fishing spots out annually and info is fairly current.. rgds, flyer ps. thanks for welcoming to the to the board-hopefully I can contribute"
41271,irishfield,2007-02-28 23:08:00,26272,I couldn't resist the sunshine and lack of wind for a change.....so I went out and got you some shots. This one gives you an idea of how much you'd better give'r in the pool to get up to Six Mile.    This one shows you that you'd better have a map and compass for 6 mile until you've figured out where all the fingers/bays go. Looking North    This one also looking North showing the simplicity of the pool in comparison...the finger up the very left side is little go home bay.  
41281,Dondorfish,2007-02-28 23:29:00,1000,Wayne - Never mind the photos from the plane - take your new boat over and show him how to make that jump - lol      Very nice pictures by the way!!    Don
41501,Cast-Away,2007-03-01 12:54:00,790,Wayne you are a riot! I LOL! Blackstone Harbour in the basin is not charted so would you mind flying over in the spring and taking a few shots of that for me? HA
41534,keith,2007-03-01 14:03:00,15,hey wayne those photos are incredible/my first overview of this area/gloucester pool seems smaller than  I envisioned/may have to tackle big chute and get down to severn river foe some additional bass fishing / I hear its quite scenic trip with lesscottages on the severn.. by the way is that an aeronca champ you fly(or may be pipercub) skis or wheels ? I got my ppl  licence in piper colt at mt hope a/p years ago.  looked like  a great CAVU day for flying!!! thanks again
41545,misfish,2007-03-01 15:17:00,29133,"  I may give that a try Wayne.   Yep six mile is trailered. Dont be just booting around out there. If you dont know the lakes,you will lose yer bottom end. Fishing is good on both lakes. Glouster is the better of the two.IMO"
41556,irishfield,2007-03-01 15:54:00,26272," The pool is a fair size and you also have ""Little Lake"" between the pool and the Port severn lock to GBay. You can also get in and fish the shallows of the outflow of Black Lake/Black River. The fast current of the little chute, the waters below big chute...the shallows of Six Mile Channel etc.  Oh and have you ever seen a cub or colt with aluminum wings?? Mine is a ""Murphy Rebel"" that I built myself.    I have some more shots of the pool and six mile...let me look for one that gives you a better overview. Also keep in mind that my Canon on Zoom is putting 30 to 40 miles into some shots that I took ....from Victoria Harbour and you can see all the way to Blue Mountain/Owen Sound in one shot."
41594,irishfield,2007-03-01 16:47:00,26272,Here's a shot looking pretty much West showing the pool and little lake. Then you have the locks and into Georgian Bay. Second shot explains itself   
41756,Tacklebuster,2007-03-01 21:01:00,303,"there's plenty of good fishing in port severn and the pool, bass, pike, musky, gar pike, cat's.  Lots to explore, and if that gets borring then go to GB.   The fun just never stops."
41815,keith,2007-03-01 22:53:00,15,"sounds good, pics are big help. I'll have to give report  in may,, thanks gentlemen"
