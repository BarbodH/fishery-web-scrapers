41798,douG,2007-03-01 22:32:00,2693,"That would be 'reservoir'.  Welcome to pikeman 34 and a half.  Good luck with your info request.  As a rule, we like to get to know someone before we share our experiences and hot spots.  Would you be any different?  'Hey Bro', do any of these babes like to go out?'"
