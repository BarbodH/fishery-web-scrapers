Don't know when, the sign doesn't say, but for all those who are Fly Fisherman, there will be a new alternative for you, if you live in downtown T.O. HH"

41576,MJL,2007-03-01 16:24:00,2427,"Wilsons will be moving shop from their current shop at Front and Church to the new location on Queen.  I think Jim was planning to have it done by the end March.  From a couple posts on other message boards, I think Wilsons may also carry items like float rods in the future.  Even with the move, it's still about a 10min walk away from my school which is nice."
41604,JFR,2007-03-01 17:08:00,498,"Is that not the Pollock's shop?  If you are a fly fisher, the staff are very knowledgeable and down to earth."
41609,Headhunter,2007-03-01 17:21:00,5703,"Mr. JR, Pollocks has been closed for a coupla years! They were at the corner of Parialment and Queen. This shop is located about 4 blocks west of the old Pollocks shop. Terry, zippers... I thought of that, but .... HH"
41611,BabyHerc,2007-03-01 17:25:00,285,"Is this gonna be a larger store?  The current location is nice and well stocked, but a little on the small side."
41615,lew,2007-03-01 17:35:00,12767,"Pollocks was a great store and it was too bad they left, but they sure had some excellent deals just before they closed the doors for the last time.  I bought up a bunch of $25 musky baits for $5 each and all his remaining Stringeze leaders for $1 each.  He was also clearing out the DownEast rod holders for $5 each but when I called to get him to hold a couple for me, he said it was 1st come-1st serve, and I missed out by an hour"
