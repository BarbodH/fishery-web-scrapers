41804,camillj,2007-03-01 22:40:00,1988,Well ... I cant believe it but it took me 2 1/2 hrs to go from Eglinton and Renforth to Eglinton and Orbitor ... a grand total of just over 1.5 km.... I made the mistake of looking for gas so I could fill up to go pick my daughter up at university tomorrow.... does anybody know whats up with the gas stations ? Any gas in the etobicoke/mississauga corridor ?
41820,Handlebarz,2007-03-01 22:58:00,3790,lots of gas here in Chatham but they are starting to jack us on the price some places are $103.7 and higher it is sad as I cross the boarder into Detroit everyday and the price at Duty free is only $0.63 I think I will be getting out the gas cans soon.
41827,Blake,2007-03-01 23:11:00,418,Getting harder to find down here and up to 99.9
41830,irishfield,2007-03-01 23:19:00,26272,Leah got gas an hour ago @ $1.05 now in Midland and the CTC ran out yesterday and got a small tank fill today she was told. They only have a bit of regular..no premium or diesel. Guess I'd better get out and get my truck filled so I'm good to head North next Friday am.  The real pisser today was getting another 600 litres of furnace oil at a mear 84.9 cents a litre.
41853,snoil,2007-03-02 00:02:00,139,Can't say for sure now but 4pm gas at Brownsline and Horner.
41858,camillj,2007-03-02 00:14:00,1988,Thanks .. I heard tell there might be some over at Dixie and the 401 but I was NOT gonna try to get there after the 2+hrs I spent just going basically around the block
41871,express168,2007-03-02 00:43:00,327,"I have had no problem finding gas around the Hamilton , Stoney Creek area. The odd station without but most I came across all had gas. 99 -1.00 per litre but they had gas."
41881,pooch,2007-03-02 01:08:00,139,Seems 2 of 3 stations out of gas in Peterborough this evening. Any idea when they will be back to normal?
