I'm a newbie to deep water fishing, but I tangled with a whole bunch of herring the other day while perch fishing, and it got me interested in the lakers and whities.  Anyone wanna tag along or have any tips for me ?"
41450,Carp,2007-03-01 04:30:00,1488,"Nice to hear the herring gave you some action.  I'm not suggesting you kept any, but isn't there still an all year closed season for Simcoe herring ?"
41468,steverowbotham,2007-03-01 11:07:00,1800,"yeah herring are still closed year round on simcoe and all of the fish were put back.  I was fishing in 30 fow and coudlnt get my bait to the bottom without hooking herring.  I moved about 50 yards or so, and it was the same deal.  Eventually, they moved through, but I ended up catching 15 or 20 of them.  But like I said, they were all released immediately."
