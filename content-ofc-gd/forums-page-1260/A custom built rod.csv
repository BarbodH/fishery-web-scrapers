I have seen several of his custom rods on another forum and have finally decided to buy one for myself....this rod I think is a frontier X  which is a great quality rod.  Hope you guys enjoy this pick  like I did....  [/url  if you guys want a nice custom built rod I would contact him, I have priced these rods and he is hard to beat for prices."

41238,Spiel,2007-02-28 21:31:00,9065,....Nice work indeed Cliff. I've always been partial to a well tied chevron and that one fits the bill.

41426,DT10Sam,2007-03-01 03:07:00,480,"WOW Cliff you are an artist, awesome work.  Regards, Sam"
41437,Roy,2007-03-01 03:33:00,13728,"That certainly is a beautiful piece of work, Cliff. The best muskie trolling rod I have was custom made for me by Spiel. The pic certainly doesn't do it justice but it really is a super rod....it's a 7'7"" G.Loomis blank.  "
41439,Nanook,2007-03-01 03:49:00,565, We sure d have some artistes on this 'Board. Very nice work!!!
41474,aplumma,2007-03-01 11:52:00,6896,Nice work Cliff it is looking good. I have known that Spiel makes a nice rod and I received one for Christmas this year. Then ordered one for Joes Birthday so going to Lak Air is really exciting this year to pick them up. I have always been a big fan of hand made items it just seems that the product is more alive than a machine wrapped product. While my budget will allow very few handmade rods the few that I get will always be cherished because of how and who made them.  Art
