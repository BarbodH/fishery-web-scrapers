I paddled through Gull Lake which is directly east and downstream of Birch. Anyhow, in the s/e corner of Birch you should be able to navigate into Springpole Lake. At the very east end of Springpole is the outlet of the Birch River and 2 rapids in succession. It's highly probable that there are trails circumventing these rapids, you just have to follow your nose and find them. Good luck!  cheers,  Mike"
