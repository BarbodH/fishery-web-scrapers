40910,Slayingm,2007-02-28 00:53:00,204,"The clients I had out today got a treat and limited out on some beauti Simcoe Lakers. We ended up getting most of the fish approx. 9.5km N.W. of Jackson's pt in 73ft of water. Blue Fox Vibrotail jigs, Williams spoons and Meegs account for the action.... we limited out before noon and moved into the Whitie grounds. Working the jigs aggressively on the bottom then moving them up while shakin seemed to be key today....most of the stikes were agressive and a good time had by all.  http://profishntanglingservices.com/MyPict...100_0025-50.jpg  P.S. .... Watch the slush out there..... very bad in some places.   Take care and Good Fish'n.... Greg."
