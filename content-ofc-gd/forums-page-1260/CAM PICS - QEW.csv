Cars are getting off the QEW and into Oakville thinking that it might be faster than the QEW.  It is not that bad except for the traffic. It is the usual stuff. Get Â½ inch of snow and the usual 45 minute ride from Toronto to Oakville in the evening becomes a 3 hour drive instead.  carp-starter  JUST EAST OF 3RD LINE EXIT            BETWEEN BRONTE AND 3RD LINE          JUSR AT BRONTE EXIT        BETWEEN BURLOAK AND BRONTE    "
