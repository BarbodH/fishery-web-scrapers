Didnt have to wake up at 5am and drive tired which was also a bonus. All fish were caught between 30-50 ft. moving around over different structure was the main idea for the day as the efforts paid off. Rock piles, humps and shouls were key areas.  15 fish were landed with spoons and minnows, half dozen lost on the way up.  enjoy...        "
