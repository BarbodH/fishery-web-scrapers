41007,ccmtcanada,2007-02-28 03:20:00,7971,"Bly and I took the dog for a walk down on the north shore of Lake Ontario tonight and saw this dock washed up on the beach.  Most of the planks are missing (I didn't take them...honest!!  ). If it's yours, please PM me and I'll let you know where to pick it up!!!      Oh yeah...your blue barrels are scattered around a 200 yard area on the beach as well.  We just had a thread about cleaning up garbage...unfortunately, this didn't fit in the garbage bag we had with us."
41012,Joey,2007-02-28 03:26:00,9122,Now how the heck to you lose a dock?  That's a first for me to see.  Joey
41014,urbanangler1990,2007-02-28 03:28:00,933,"me too, first time ive seen someone lose a DOCK?? funny stuff"
41018,GbayGiant,2007-02-28 03:31:00,1780,"Hahha, could you imagine going to your cottage ""Honey where did the dock go ?""  Must have been anchored poorly, or the chains broke some how."
41020,Lostchild,2007-02-28 03:32:00,153,Hey you did some photo editing...I was going to say that the other thing beside the dock in the original picture was mine. LOL
41034,irishfield,2007-02-28 04:24:00,26272,A dock..heck that's nothing.. a guy lost his entire boat house and it went a few miles down Lake Temagami last fall...the night before freeze up. Will look for that picture..
41079,ccmtcanada,2007-02-28 12:43:00,7971," LOL Wayne...was his boat in it still??  Looking forward to that pic!  I've lived in Ajax/Whitby my entire life and have seen lots of plywood, and HUGE trees along the shore, but this is the first time I saw a whole dock sitting there.  It sure was strange to see!!!"
41146,irishfield,2007-02-28 16:48:00,26272,Found them last night...but then they were dynamic links so I went to bed. Saved them and uploaded this morning..here they are...  They lost it last year..so they tied it up good this year
41148,musky66,2007-02-28 16:59:00,273,My folks are on Lake Muskoka and docks wash in to their shoreline every year it seams. Last summer I spied a large picnic table from the Town beach floating almost submerged in the Bay- I towed it to the house. Parents called the Town to come and get it and they sent two girls in a pickup. My 70 year old parents had to help them load it up! Tax dollars at work! Have also found dock dribs moved by ice- just under the surface- the hard way!
41159,Joey,2007-02-28 17:24:00,9122,Great pictures Wayne.  Now imagine being stranded on a deserted island and a house just washes up on shore  Joey

41197,lew,2007-02-28 19:04:00,12767,"When were fish'n Quinte in the springtime, we camp at the extreme east end of a long narrow bay, and if there's a strong wind from the west for a couple days it can actually push the water into the bay and raise the level by as much as a foot.  Couple years back we headed down to the dock to go out fish'n, and sure enuff, the dock had floated off it's crib in the high water and drifted away with my boat still attached to it  Luckily there was another person there with a boat and was able to chase mine down and bring it back in.  Who'd of thought when you tie up to a dock, you need to chuck the anchor out too"
41206,ccmtcanada,2007-02-28 19:31:00,7971, Lew...oh man...I can just picture you walking down to the dock with coffee in hand...taking a look around and then spitting the coffee out!!  Good thing there was that other person there to get your boat!!!
41333,nelly,2007-03-01 00:58:00,256,"Good timing since my friend was hoping to convert his docks to floating ones. (LOL) Just kidding, won't take something that doesn't belong to me."
41620,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 18:06:00,455,"HEY!!!!!!   dang, that is where most of Shawn's dog house went too, please I want  that back!LOL"
41743,ccmtcanada,2007-03-01 20:42:00,7971, LOL...I was wondering why I saw his devil sticker floating on a piece of wood....I think he set the whole thing afloat....
41751,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 20:50:00,455,"LOL`   he must of did that while we were all asleep. If I don't get that back soon, I will have no where to put him when he has been naughty.LOL   I guess Angelina's playhouse will have to do for now.LOL"
41754,ccmtcanada,2007-03-01 20:59:00,7971, LOL...her playhouse?  Why punish Angelina for his behavior??  Hey wait...I wanna fish in his Lund this year...so I'm gonna be nice to him now...LOL
41759,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 21:06:00,455,"LOL, you are killing me    you are right though about punishing Angelina, I have to remember who has the power to put me in a home when I am old.LOL   you can just blame me Cliff when it is time for you both to go fishing again."
41766,Garyv,2007-03-01 21:25:00,547,Last time I saw that my mother in law was floating away on it....
41779,ccmtcanada,2007-03-01 21:44:00,7971, LOL...no ice flows so you had to improvise eh?
41790,fishergirl72,2007-03-01 22:11:00,455," LOL, Garyv! Are you sure that it was your mother-in-law or could it be my ex mother-inlaw?   LOL"
