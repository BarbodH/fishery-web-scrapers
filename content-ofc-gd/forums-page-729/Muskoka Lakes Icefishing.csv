We have been renting a hut and buying our bait courtesy of Bait on the Lake in Glen Orchard (4000 Muskoka Road 169). The new owner, Capt. John Blanchard has been great to us and we just want to show him a little love here, as we've been catching some decent fish in one of the best huts I've ever fished out of. We've been parking and getting on the ice at Clevelands House near Minett and fishing off the southernmost tip of Wistowe Island. No lunkers yet, but Lake Joseph opens Monday, which just happens to be a stat holiday!  For those interested, they are running a derby from February 13th to mid March. Don't write these dates in stone, as I don't have confirmation yet, but they are close. Top prize is $1500 cash, and the rest of the prize pool wasn't anything to complain about. I will post  a new topic when I get back off the ice this weekend with all the specifics, if not sooner.  If you want, you can contact John at Bait on the Lake for specifics: ph. 705-765-1600 7 days a week 7 a.m. to 5 p.m."
