431782,aniceguy,2010-02-10 13:24:00,1094,sucks its a good show...but drinking 10 redbulls a day and smoking 400 butts aday does have consequences
431786,mbac31,2010-02-10 13:28:00,904,I have done Crab Fishing in Alaska befoe. I'm surprised he lived to be 53. I did not like the job at all. Different breed of human being to do that job.
431788,LucG,2010-02-10 13:29:00,779,"I followed the last couple seasons, its too bad!"
431799,NAC,2010-02-10 14:09:00,369,one of the few good shows left on OLN.  RIP Capt Phil.
431807,blaque,2010-02-10 14:27:00,2419,"WOW, too young. He was quite a character.  RIP"
431808,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-10 14:28:00,4399,Rest in peace Phil Harris.  Redbull and Cigs and no sleep=early grave.
431814,Joey,2010-02-10 14:43:00,9122,"Ya, great show, but they smoke waaaaaaaay too much.  What a shame.  Joey"
431822,bigbuck,2010-02-10 15:10:00,2449,You knew it was coming with him. It's too bad and I feel for his family.
431826,jayess,2010-02-10 15:22:00,187, Agreed... I wish OLN they'd clean up their act...    That's the first thing that came to my mind. The guy smoked like a chimney
431837,Dutchy,2010-02-10 15:41:00,416," Yup, and he already had deep vein thrombosis last season which he was lucky to survive when it went into his lung. He was not a picture of health. Still he was a character."
431853,Harrison,2010-02-10 16:56:00,2202,"I remember the Lung episode last season.  Nice thing about the show is it actually shows real emotion.  Or I like to think so anyways.  You could see the concern in his kids eyes.  He was a character, great sense of humour.....  One of my favs was his self proclaimed ability to find the crab by looking for air bubbles on the surface, cause crab have to fart too.  RIP"
431903,canadadude,2010-02-10 19:40:00,769,"Rest in Peace captain Phill, this is very sad news, my condolences go out to your familly"
431914,aniceguy,2010-02-10 20:11:00,1094,every time I have eaten crabs in the last while I think about those guys Marvin what the hell you were a crabber too...dang I gotta hear the story on that one day
431973,NAC,2010-02-10 22:12:00,369,  oops
431982,LeXXington,2010-02-10 22:28:00,1928,One of the best show's out there.  RIP -
432006,smitter,2010-02-10 23:33:00,106,"I love that show, this sucks."
432103,Dutch,2010-02-11 02:44:00,831,"I like the show, and Capt. Phil was one of the more likable characters.  Bad lifestyle choices has consequences.....I feel bad for his sons.  Hopefully they will stop smoking."
432107,backbay,2010-02-11 02:50:00,773,"We seldom missed a show, it's interesting how you seem to get a measure of somebody by watching them on tv. Condolences for his family, RIP."
432143,Stern Rules,2010-02-11 05:13:00,342,Isn't that on Discovery?
432216,Dutchy,2010-02-11 15:15:00,416, Yes it is on Discovery.
