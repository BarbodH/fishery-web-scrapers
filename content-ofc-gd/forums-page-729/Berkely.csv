431673,mjack 7,2010-02-10 01:19:00,22,How are you putting the line on. Never have had a problem with any micro ice including this year.  I use only 3 and 6lb however and only fill my spools 3/4 full.  All my ice reels are symetre 750's and tica 500ss.   Most line flying off the spool is caused more from over filling or put on incorectly.
431697,bassmaster4,2010-02-10 02:03:00,801,"the only bad experience i ever had with a berkley product i didnt even own it, i tried to see how the rod tip was in terms of sensitivity (the rod was a cherry wood) so i flicked the tip and it snapped off. I looked around put the rod down in the display thing and left. other than that i like their mono and the gulp."
431698,CLofchik,2010-02-10 02:06:00,854,The 1st Law Of Fishing Tackle.  The quality of the product declines exponentially to the size of it's marketing budget.  Almost all of the tackle I use now come from smaller companies you'll rarely see running ads or paying pro's to promote.
431722,limeyangler,2010-02-10 02:52:00,5204,"I love the micro ice line......bought three new spools this year, 2 of the chrystal stuff and one regular....works great for me....   But as for gulp....hmmmmmm......in my experience it does not out fish live bait, and as for their leaky container....not only does my gear stink to high heaven....it leaked in a tackle bag i had in the back of my truck....now the truck smells like....i wont say....its a family site!  Then to try and charge you 15 bucks more to store it is just taking the P$#s !!!!"
431781,Bernie66,2010-02-10 13:22:00,123,"I guess all big companies has their good and bad products.  Personally, I am a big fan of their old Series One rods and their 3"" + 4"" pinkies have caught me plenty of nice bows."
431792,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-10 13:45:00,2690,"Still have a lightning rod, that was purchased almost 27 years ago...Trilene XT is still the best mono in my books...yeah it sucks that you had trouble with the container, but, tell that to Berkley, because it sounds like that is who this post is addressed to.  If it bothers you that much...don't buy it...nothing hurts companies more than losing business, but, tell them why...maybe they will do something to fix it.  Good luck!"
431571,canadadude,2010-02-09 21:10:00,769,"I've been using berkely lines and products for almost 30yrs and have found them more then satisfactory until this year!!! Your micro ice line sucks, it has more memory in it then any mono I've ever used no matter what pound test from 2lb- 8lb it sucks big time, it's ashame considering this was once the best line for ice fishing. Your gulp products in a jar are also a freaking joke, everything I own is covered in your stinking gulp juice your freaking product leaks out on all my gear. I don't care if Berkely gulp is the answer to live bait, it's a dirty, stinky slimy product to cary in my tackle pouch.It really gets me angry when a company like this absorbs a bunch of small companies and turns there products into Berkey crap"
431578,highdrifter,2010-02-09 21:19:00,2534,"I hear they're working on a new container for their gulp baits...  I'd have to agree with you on those...  As for the line, cold temps play a big part in the memory..  HD"
431579,blaque,2010-02-09 21:23:00,2419,I dont think theres any berkely rep's. here? Your rant will fall to the floor unused..........but by all means GIVE ER'!
431583,Guest steel'n'esox,2010-02-09 21:27:00,0,"  And a big round of applause for Berkley products, you must be pissed, although I would have to agree with you on this one, when I look back at the Berkley products I use to use, and what I use now there not making anything off me."
431584,bushart,2010-02-09 21:29:00,2628,  Don't candy coat it man...Give it to them straight
431586,danbouck,2010-02-09 21:30:00,4380,Yes it stinks and it's messy but I wouldn't have caught nearly as many fish this year without their products.
431588,canadadude,2010-02-09 21:37:00,769,"Sorry to rant on this great fish'in site , but I've had enough crap from the Berkely corporation there products are below anybodies quality and for the fisher's on here I would ask for a boycot on there all berkely products. There selling substandard crap and expecting us fishers to use there product because of the name. For years berkely made and sold a fine product but unfortunatly they have chosen to manufaction there product cheaply over seas and the results suck"
431590,hammercarp,2010-02-09 21:43:00,964,Being a dedicated carp angler that targets only carp.I found that their XT and Big Game  line to be great for carp fishing. But their carp bait is another story.
431591,Syn,2010-02-09 21:44:00,519, After reading that part I decided to go check my tackle bag. Luckily I kept the gulp (I switched back to powerbait less messy) in a bubble wraped envelope that I had around. This is what I found....nice. IF I did not have the envelope all that crap would be on my gear and fishing clothes. I had the lid closed on TIGHT. I guess it just seeped out over time???  pic1  pic2
431594,fish_fishburn,2010-02-09 21:51:00,1311,"My buddy had to replace all the carpet in the cockpit of his bass boat from that crap. ate the adhesive that was holding the carpet down. And ive heard from many who have had them leak all over the place. But the gulp in a bag is a good product, I would say. I feel for ya man thats a hell of a mess to try and clean up."
431595,mbac31,2010-02-09 21:52:00,904,Plano andf Berkley make a Tackle bait management  system right now that works great. Yes their ice line does not work that great. Their Baits(Gulp) have been out fishing live bait for me anyways for a while now. Walleye/bass/perch/etc love the stuff. Email pure fishing with your displeasure
431598,canadadude,2010-02-09 21:59:00,769,"I agree but why can't they make it so everything I own dosn't smell like there idiot product gulp alive. At 5+ dollars a jar or 20+ dollars a tub why do I have empty freaking jars and there stink all over ny fish'in bag. Screw you dudes at berkely you want to sell me your product and then I have to put up with cleaning the mess!! Live bait is 10X cleaner then any of those stinking Berkely products and 100% more effective, don't get con ed by the berkely reps, I fish with one and they no poo"
431602,canadadude,2010-02-09 22:09:00,769,"so what are you telling me, now I have to buy a tackle bait managent system to use there product. Are you freaking kidding me, at $5.00 + dollars a jar they should be baiting my line with there crap!!!! Give me a break I pay good hard earned $$$$$$$ for there product, Berkely should at the very least give me a product that is usable and does not interfere with the rest of my gear."
431603,bassjnkie,2010-02-09 22:10:00,1101,"Yes the Gulp containers suck, but the product works. I just put the bait in a ZipLoc twist lock container. It works great.  "
431605,smitter,2010-02-09 22:14:00,106,"I use some Berkley products.  Gulp, Powerbait, and Trilene XL have a home in my tackle box, I find them to be quality products.  Fireline, Vanish & Berkely rods, well, lets just say you can buy better stuff."

431610,BillM,2010-02-09 22:37:00,17367,"With all the $$$$ Berkley makes on Gulp, it shouldn't take a team of rocket scientists to figure out a leakproof container..  I love using Gulp leeches on worm harnesses, they last forever."
431615,canadadude,2010-02-09 22:47:00,769,"Dude it's freaking micro ice, ICE it's  made to work in the freaking cold, by the way I'm using it -5c to 0c so not that cold what the crap did you do to this line. Micro ice for years was the best freaking line you could buy, I loved it untill this year and don't blame my reels I use Diawa 700 wiskers on all my ice gear"
431616,GBW,2010-02-09 22:48:00,8460,"So the secret in the juice is Soy Sauce? I have to say that yes it sux to have to deal with the mess but I too use the ziplock tub and don't have a problem.  Maybe they should throw in a coupon for a free ziplock tube when you buy the stuff? Line?  HAHAHAHA, garbage...  I've used better dentalfloss then the Crystal they sell...."
431629,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-09 23:12:00,4399,"I have mixed feelings about Berkely, I like Gulp but only have ever bought the small packages love Trilene lines but the Vanish product are the worst I have ever used.  I have to agree with the comments on the Gulp bait bucket there obviously is a problem with leaking and just as obvious Berkely does seem to care. The Berkely solution is ask customers to buy another container to replace the defective one. There are aftermarket products that will work better and prevent the Gulp mess it`s unfortunate that Berkley is reallying on the customers initiative to solve the problem instead of their own."
431631,Whitespinnerbait,2010-02-09 23:26:00,2038,Berkley Mono =====
431634,Syn,2010-02-09 23:37:00,519,"I loved berkley mono too back in the day (early 90's) and use to fish with it a lot. I felt Berkley line jumped the shark when they started making ""sensation"" and ""ultra thin"". Felt like I was buying rubbers not fishing line. The ultra thin was ok ( sensation not so much) but I think they changed the formula of ultrathin in the mid 90's. Mostly using braid for pikies and flouro (bass/panfish) now."
431640,archie_james_c,2010-02-09 23:49:00,618,"  Agreed. Except for GULP, that crap rocks..."
431641,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-02-09 23:49:00,1107,"I don't take the foil/foam part that seals it for storage on store shelves the stuff ya peel off to open it,  out of 5-6 buckets I have never had even a slight leak . I just toss them in my big fishing stuff bin when I empty the boat out after a day of fishing never had a problem at all."
431657,Muskieman,2010-02-10 00:35:00,2472,"For every ..Orvis...Shimano..G Loomis... St Croix.... I've owned and broken, there is a Berkley Rod out there that will do the same job and is just as sensitive as the overpriced designer competition... And guess what ? Most of them are under  100.00$  You cannot take away my Lightnin' Rods or Gorilla Sticks... just like bread and butter to me. Trilene has NEVER let me down. I'm not a big fan of scented baits so I have nothing to say on that matter.  Just my 5 cents.  RFS "
