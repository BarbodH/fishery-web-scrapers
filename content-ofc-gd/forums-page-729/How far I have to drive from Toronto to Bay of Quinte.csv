Map  Drive to the very end of Manley Road...you'll see an opening where there's a boat launch, probably some other trucks/cars too.  Just walk straight out from the launch about 750m and you'll hit 18 ft of water.  Doesn't get much deeper than that around there.  If you head about 1000m due east from that location you'll hit a shoal that might be productive.  Cheers"
