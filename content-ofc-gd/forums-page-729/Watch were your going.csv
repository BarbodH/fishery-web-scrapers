So just no your water and ride your sleds safe The people were sent to hospital for precautions but will be fine other then the recovery bill the police gave him (beats a DUI i guess lol)"

431260,Whitespinnerbait,2010-02-09 02:01:00,2038,  Oh  I always thought thats why Snowmobiles came equipped with '' Headlights ''
431277,Greencoachdog,2010-02-09 02:07:00,8163," The headlight is for dry land... not the ice, watch the vid Paul!"
