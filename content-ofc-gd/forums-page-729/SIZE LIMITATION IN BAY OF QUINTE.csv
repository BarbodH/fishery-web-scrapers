431183,CRAPPIE,2010-02-08 22:27:00,213,Just want to ask what is the size limit for Walleye in Bay of Quinte.  thanks in advance!
431189,camillj,2010-02-08 22:55:00,1988,Yes
431200,irishfield,2010-02-08 23:38:00,26272,Reg books are freeeeeeee.....
431211,Stoty,2010-02-08 23:52:00,2910,"Yes there is.  You can keep 4 fish with only one being larger than 25""."
431222,mbac31,2010-02-09 00:14:00,904,"4 Fish limit. One over 25"" and 3 under 25"" for a regular sportsfishing licence."
431233,kickingfrog,2010-02-09 00:57:00,8333,"   But hard to find in many areas, and some years not available at all.  Here is a link: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_163615.html"
431242,irishfield,2010-02-09 01:19:00,26272,Hard to find in Feb.. Rob.. come'on! Walk into any tackle shop or CTC and ask for one at the courtesy counter.
431247,Sinker,2010-02-09 01:32:00,8692,"Isn't it 24.8""  I didn't look at the regs, I just thought that's what it was.  I'll be out there tomorrow  S."
431249,Greencoachdog,2010-02-09 01:38:00,8163," ... for you it's one over 12"" and not to exceed 13"" and 2 under 12""... have a good feast ""meat hunter""!!!"
431294,fishhunter,2010-02-09 02:55:00,604,"save yourself any problens and set your size at 24.5 that way you know your 100% safe 24.8 is the law and not 25""."
431297,Stoty,2010-02-09 03:04:00,2910,"Lol......24.8, or 25....same thing. Depends on how you measure it.  Either way.....just be smart about it and make sure you stay well back of 25"" for three of your fish."
431299,irishfield,2010-02-09 03:08:00,26272,Yep.. cause the CO will tail pinch it for measured length !
431300,Stoty,2010-02-09 03:10:00,2910,Exactly!
431318,Sinker,2010-02-09 03:40:00,8692,"   I'll be happy with 4 between 14-20""  You know there is gonna be a fish fry  S."
431360,kickingfrog,2010-02-09 13:04:00,8333,"  Any means every, and I'll bet that some don't always have them Wayne. In past years they have been printed late and one year there wasn't any new ones printed at all."
431363,Jer,2010-02-09 13:20:00,1426,  I assume you have internet access (being on the site and all)...  2010 regs  zone 20  I would always want to read the regs for myself rather than rely on discussion board opinion and chatter (not that this particular site would steer you wrong).  ...and the Canadian Tire stores are chock full of hardcopy summaries right now.
431371,anders,2010-02-09 14:00:00,1168,"regs are not always available....two weeks ago the mnr here in town didnt have any left, in french or english...couldnt find any in town.  they did get them in though...saw them Friday"
431514,ctdd2006,2010-02-09 19:55:00,531,sometimes they can't even supply the licenses themselves let alone the regs!  We were without any stickers here for 3 weeks into the season.
