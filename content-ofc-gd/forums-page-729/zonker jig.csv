431165,mr blizzard,2010-02-08 21:39:00,1589,Apparently it is fairly new and is very effective on lake trout.  Any information  would help all laker fans. Thanks.
431167,redneck666,2010-02-08 21:47:00,563,"hmmmm, i'd like to know the answer to that question too."

431169,vinnimon,2010-02-08 21:56:00,2593,check out [email protected] or goto to bing and punch in zonker jig.The look like oversized wooly buggers on reg jig heads.
431171,steverowbotham,2010-02-08 21:59:00,1800,"The Simcoe Zonker is a jig I have been using for a couple seasons and only posted about it recently for the lakers, you can see the selection here  http://sircatchalot.piczo.com/?g=42643395&cr=2  Any questions please email me @ [email protected]"
431175,Roy,2010-02-08 22:05:00,13728,"Steve, Zonkers don't look the same as the ones on your site."
431180,vinnimon,2010-02-08 22:16:00,2593,as roy said.And a little pricey too.just my 2cnts worth thats all.
431181,bare foot wader,2010-02-08 22:23:00,1354,"a zonker is a popular fly pattern...zonker jig is a just a zonker tied on a jig head....super easy to tie your own if you've tied any flies before...if not very easy to learn....or find a local fly tier, bring him your favourite jig head and pay to have a few tied."

431250,solopaddler,2010-02-09 01:42:00,8605,I'll bet Spiel could tie some wicked zonker jigs.
431253,Roy,2010-02-09 01:45:00,13728,"Yes he certainly could, Mike. To me, a zonker is a Dahlberg with a lead head."
431255,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-09 01:45:00,0,its amazing how some try to re-invent the wheel....lol Looks like a boobie nymph..
431262,Sebastian,2010-02-09 02:02:00,208,Relax. It's a jig head with hair on it. Lakers are dumb fish that hit anything that looks remotely close to a minnow.
431285,Fang,2010-02-09 02:32:00,1330,1/4 and 3/8 oz white maribou jigs have been a northern Ontario stable for lakers for well before I started fishing. For the oldtimers on Temagami no outing would be complete without a few of these in the tackle box. I can date back to when I was 19 (in 1983) on my first backwoods ice fishing trip in temagami and all of us where rigged with white or chartruese maribou jigs. Most were full body but we did have those crappie styles too with the chenille wrapped boddies. I tied them for a while with all kinds of variations. Best were ones with tinsel and flashibou mixed in.  for those that custom tie jigs many of the most popular streamer flies make it into very good patterns on a jig head. Before I sold all my stuff used to tie all kinds of walleye jigs in these patterns for Quinte  Mickey Finns Grey Ghosts Muddlers Rabbit strip Zonkers Wooly Buggers and even Dahlberg deer hair bodies and whitlock sculpins.  Well tied hand made jigs are always worth a bit more than the mass produced with cheap thread and hooks. Give them a shot if you haven't already.

431346,steverowbotham,2010-02-09 10:13:00,1800, thank you
431348,steverowbotham,2010-02-09 10:20:00,1800, well my apologies to you sir for trying something different
431353,NAC,2010-02-09 12:21:00,369,  steelhead too...
431357,Spiel,2010-02-09 12:59:00,9065,"The Zonker Fly has been around for over three decades. Google, Dan Byford As with any fly pattern it comes in as many variations as there are tyers.  Whether it be on a fly hook ar a jig head it's been a time tested winner.  Now if you'll excuse me I think I should get over to my vise."
