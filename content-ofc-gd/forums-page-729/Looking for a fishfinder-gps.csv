430289,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-02-06 19:20:00,76,I know there are tons and tons of options out there....  I want and 'need' a good unit for summer. Can anyone recommend a good unit that is affordable....say something between $600-800  Any input would be appreciated....pros and cons  Thanks guys
430403,Terry,2010-02-07 01:19:00,14456,I love this thing and you can add  the side scan later if you like    http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?cPat...roducts_id=5283
430491,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-02-07 12:08:00,76,Thats perfect...thanks.  Any cons or features you wish this thing had ??
430492,Terry,2010-02-07 12:17:00,14456,"the only thing I don't like is, it takes about a minute to start because it is computerized but I have found nothing else wrong with it  people had problems with all the HDS units when they first came out but the had a software up date for them and no more problems"
430493,Big Cliff,2010-02-07 12:37:00,6899,I also have the HDS5 and really like it.
430506,Stoty,2010-02-07 13:22:00,2910,Lowrance HDS units for sure!! I run an HDS7 and am buying a HDS5 to network together with it. Awesome units!  Do yourself a favour though and get the Platinum chip with the 3D shaded maps!!
430601,Dara,2010-02-07 16:17:00,3052,Hey Stoty I'm looking at getting the HDS 7 but I am considering the 8. Is the screen big enough on the 7 or would you advise the 8?
430625,archie_james_c,2010-02-07 17:17:00,618,Tagged for interest as I'm obsessing over an HDS7 for this season as well .
430650,Terry,2010-02-07 18:21:00,14456, I have the 5 and I hope to buy the 8 as my main unit it's a lot more money then the 7  but  has more memory slots and the bigger screen
430715,Fang,2010-02-07 19:53:00,1330,If you know your Lowrance/Humminbird units you can pick up some very good deals on used and new ones on ebay.  I bought a used HB 787 from this board (Thanks Aaron) and got to use it this weekend for the first time. GPS/color finder. Wow what a difference to my Lowrance X55. I have always owned Lowrance - this is my first HB and it did take a lot of convincing myself to make the switch  If you can find one on ebay these are a few really good discontinued units 1-2 years old  Lowrance LMS series Eagle 640
430801,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-02-07 22:52:00,76,"Okay i have been looking at the Lowrance HDS 5 online and see that many look different...  At the end of the descriptions there are different numbers, for example, 140-19, 140-30, 140-21  Another question....after I but the unit do I have to buy a card too ?? (looks like they are around $250 or so)  thanks guys"
431306,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-02-09 03:26:00,76,bump (sorry)  Anyone ?   Thanks guys
431321,Stoty,2010-02-09 03:44:00,2910," I love the HDS7, but obviously if your pocket book can afford it...get the biggest unit you can! I'd LOVE a HDS10, but ya....I don't have a money tree in my backyard!"
431330,BillM,2010-02-09 04:08:00,17367,We run a separate Sonar/GPS.  Humminbird 747c along with an Eagle Intellimap 500C.  Combine that with the Navionics Gold + maps and we have no complaints..
431470,boatman,2010-02-09 18:59:00,350,"I just purchased two Lowrance HDS-7 combos for work today. $1050 at Radioworld in Toronto. They are on back order and should arrive by March. I intially looked at the HDS-5, but chose to upgrade to the 7 due to the window size. They also sold me the Hotmaps card for $150 each. Check them out."
431511,Dara,2010-02-09 19:49:00,3052," Considering I am about to be handed a $700.00 dollar bill to fix my clutch, I think I will be stopping at the 7 as well.  PS Orest says he will match Radio worlds prices"
431636,archie_james_c,2010-02-09 23:45:00,618, He seems to be giving out deals as of late . Maybe he smells the retirement pension coming and just doesn't care anymore
431652,tonyb,2010-02-10 00:27:00,1637,"Here is a good deal, my buddy Aaron is selling  http://www.gettinghooked.net/forums/showthread.php?t=2505  Cheers, Tony"
431671,scugpg,2010-02-10 01:14:00,1373,Consider the Lowrance LMS-522c unit. Tons of people have it and love it. The LMS 520 is the same unit just with an external antenna.  You should be able to track a used one down.  If I didn't have a unit right now I'd be buying an HDS5 or 7 those are pretty slick!
