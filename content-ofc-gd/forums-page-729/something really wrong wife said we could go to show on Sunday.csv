431381,skinny,2010-02-09 14:34:00,442,well something must be up cause my wife is only off on Sunday and Monday and said we could go as a family on Sunday to the fishing show and I'm already going ice fishing on Monday. something must be wrong or she is up to something. Why do I feel this will cost me
431385,llpp,2010-02-09 14:46:00,30,Good time to look at that new boat... eh..
431398,I'mHooked,2010-02-09 15:14:00,525,She just wants you to buy her HER some new fishin gear! ...She's just using you for your fishing knowledge!...Get there quick before she changes her mind!
431413,highdrifter,2010-02-09 15:59:00,2534,She's gotta be up to something..  Did ya happen to notice a new shoe rack??!!!
431414,Twocoda,2010-02-09 16:00:00,4130,you know what it is ????? the Halmark Holiday is upon us ....ya get more out of them with chocolates as opposed to dirty laundry
431428,Roy,2010-02-09 17:01:00,13728,I'd say there's a good chance you won't be fishing Monday.
431438,vinnimon,2010-02-09 17:55:00,2593,A nice romantic dinner after the fishing show should get you out of a bind.But for monday I have a feeling your going to have to sleep in.  Valentines day then family day.I think were all done for.My wife is also pulling the nicey nicey gig on me.I have two cards to play with and Im going to use one for now.Not going to try my luck a second time.
431439,Dara,2010-02-09 17:56:00,3052,Are you needing a kitchen remodel?
431554,bassjnkie,2010-02-09 20:50:00,1101,I thinks she's going to see what the actual price of you fishing stuff is.
431556,Rich Clemens,2010-02-09 20:53:00,3131,This may not be a good time to argue.   Just say YES DEAR ... and go to the fishing show.   (You'll find out soon enough     )
431559,fishindude,2010-02-09 20:58:00,220,It's a trap
431592,skinny,2010-02-09 21:46:00,442,something smells and I don't think it's fish this time. I just havn't figured out whats up. i bet she will just pocket this one for later and use it as one of those remeber when deals
431607,Dozer,2010-02-09 22:20:00,896,"1. Budget Control Officer...  2. Leverage... theres probably some stupid cousins wedding she wants you to go to.  3. It's a trap.  4. While your there, she will have some unexpected news to tell you...  Don't let your guard down, and remember, if you need an escape route, just tell her ya gotta go use the facilities."
431608,Dozer,2010-02-09 22:22:00,896,"...oh yeah... and best of luck my friend, best of luck."
431682,irishfield,2010-02-10 01:40:00,26272,Just don't forget Sunday is Valentines' Day... or it will be the last time you step out somewhere !!!

431993,canuckjack,2010-02-10 23:00:00,121,"This can't be good man...and now you've got me thinking, my wife already signed on to hit the Ottawa show at the end of the month so I'm kinda worried too  What I really want to know is how much it's going to cost me after I spend the day watching the 500, whoever booked that on V-Day was just setting a bunch of rednecks up for failure"
