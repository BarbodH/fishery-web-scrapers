431417,PickerelHunter,2010-02-09 16:10:00,100,Hey guys...I've read conflicting things about when the ice huts/bungalows need to be off the ice on Nipissing.  Trying to book something in March and looking when the last weekend would be.  Thanks Pete

431436,cheaptackle,2010-02-09 17:48:00,849,"But watch your season closing dates up there!  Haven't got my copy of the regs handy but when I was last on Nip walleye closed before the huts had to come off is what I remember.  Not sure if it changed for 2010, didn't check as I'm not planning to go this year.  Michael"
431441,irishfield,2010-02-09 18:01:00,26272,Nippissing closes to ALL species on March 16th... grab a reg book guys.. PLEASE!
431442,PickerelHunter,2010-02-09 18:01:00,100,"Walleye and pike both state ""Third Sunday in March"" which would be the 21st...this is why I was confused on the actual date....16th or 21st"
431443,irishfield,2010-02-09 18:03:00,26272,  Now read the exceptions before you find yourself in trouble...
431447,PickerelHunter,2010-02-09 18:11:00,100,Right...which is part of the reason I came on here to find out from others to be 100% sure...thanks
431449,Roy,2010-02-09 18:17:00,13728,"Yeah, and please do not confuse ice hut removal dates with fishing season closings."
431454,PickerelHunter,2010-02-09 18:26:00,100,I thought logically they might go hand in hand....which is why I asked...would never actually do anything without being 100% sure...thanks for the help everyone
431623,Fisherman,2010-02-09 23:00:00,7201,"That's why you read the regs available on line and printed, then you have no recourse to blame the guy that heard something because you read it yourself along with the EXCEPTIONS, don't be lazy."
431670,sandybay,2010-02-10 01:09:00,64,"March 15th is the last day you can fish Nipissing, but they give us until the end of March to get our huts off."
431720,curlrap,2010-02-10 02:51:00,58,"Could be just me, but there seems to be many grumpy old men on this site??"
431734,Dara,2010-02-10 03:19:00,3052,  They get like that in winter...Cabin fever
431784,capt_hooked,2010-02-10 13:26:00,212,Ha..!  I deal with them everyday...  Grumpy old fishermen... But they are mostly harmless..!
431794,Bernie,2010-02-10 13:50:00,3190,  Ha ! You must get a whole bunch of them somewhere around the end of June.
