I realize it is better to be able to move around to target them, but I don't have that kind of gear and will be bringing two other first timers for these species as well.  I have a good idea of the techniques and presentations to offer these fine specimens thanks to the board, but the question remains, which operator would you recommend.  The factors I define for being the 'best' include:  1. Performance (Who is well known for putting you on fish)?  2. Friendliness of Operators  3. Comfort / Condition of accomodations (heated transportation, clean and comfortable huts)  There are several hut operators I have in mind (Bonnie Boats, Tim Hales, Floyd Hales, Hank Heyink, etc...) but I've found limited reviews about them on message boards.  Your help would be greatly appreciated. You could be helping an angler catch their first whitie / laker. I promise to post fish porn if we're succesful!"
429170,Terry,2010-02-03 21:35:00,14456,the problem is you're (the hut operators) only as good as your last successful customer  ...
429188,fishhunter,2010-02-03 22:37:00,604,"Hank Heyink is my choice. I  used him alot a couple years back but now I run and gun. But thats not to say the others are not as good. Its called fishing for a reason. No matter how good you are you will always have days that you cant put a fish on the ice. The shacks are very clean, great stoves and a very good staff that look after you. bring a couple big dark towels that you can use to cover your windows and you can see down 35-40 feet in 70 feet of water. one nice thing is you have a landing net( Yes i said landing net) to land your fish so if you want  to let them swim away. No gaff holes in the fish. Heads up when you start to get set up cover your holes till you get everything put into place . with the big holes it so easy to drop stuff down them. Hope you have a great weekend. If you have any other questions drop me a pm and ill do what i can to help you out."
