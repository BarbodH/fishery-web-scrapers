429007,Canuck2fan,2010-02-03 04:42:00,1444,"An excellent deal on polarized glassed used to be available at Costco. I got a pair with 3 different lenses for 49.95. I still have the amber ones after 4 years and not a scratch on the lens. I lost the case fishing with the extra 2 sets of lenses in them. I am actually going to get another set if Costco still has them. They were made by uvex who make safety glasses and I guess that is why I couldn't scratch the lenses. I have stepped on them dropped them on gravel. Had more than ""friend"" bend back a branch and then just for fun let it smack me in the face while walking through the bush, so the lenses do stand up. As for the quality of sighting things in the water I routinely nail fish that my buddies wearing the big dollar glasses can't see...."
429008,BillM,2010-02-03 05:15:00,17367,I have the same Uvex from Costco...  Only prob is that one set of lenses are polarized..  The other two you get aren't.
429019,sconceptor,2010-02-03 07:27:00,146,"Just bought a pair of IronMan at Walmart for 28$....thought they were decent, dark shade.  I really liked my Bolle H20 with the floating strap that had swivels on the end to hook onto the frame....no bulky strap, just a loose thin cord with some floats.  Ran over them with the Exploder this fall when the fell out the passenger side after the wife to be got out of it.   Lenses broke, but the frames still fine.  Going to contact Bolle to see if I can get a new pair of lenses.  Pros: high cost= better quality!!!!!!!!!, can get 5 pairs or so of decent cheap ones(30$) for the price of a good 150$-200$+pair Cons: high cost can be lost just as easily, cheap pairs scratch more easily, can be less comfortable, can break more easily.....  Walked by a Sunglass Hut the other weekend, and dreamed of picking up a new pair of higher end polarized.....but couldn't swing it.  Maybe check out BassPro sometime, where there's a wider selection of prices 10$ on up to the high end Oakleys.  Maybe find something around 100$?"
429021,mtpockets2,2010-02-03 09:42:00,12,I have 2 pair of H2optix. 1 pair for sunny days and a pair for cloudy. I got them at Elwood Epps fishing store and from what I've been told they still carry them. They weren't that expensive either.
429027,Blake,2010-02-03 12:00:00,418,Take a look at Solar Bat glasses.  I started using them last year and they were the best I have used so far.  Incredible for fishing and driving.  Style and lense colour is usually preference.  I really like their green lense or the two tone pairs.  Warranty is amazing as with service.
429034,dave524,2010-02-03 12:41:00,4508,"For those of us that need bifocals to do routine tasks , last time I needed some correction in the top 1/2 as well and can't swing the price of polarized presciption glasses. I've been getting these for some time and been very happy with them. The clips are very close fitting, light and secure unlike most of the aftermarket polarized clip ons. Last pair is 4 years old and the magnetics are still strong.  Look at the Easy Clip line  http://www.aspexeyewear.com/"

429141,JohnF,2010-02-03 18:36:00,3494,I picked up a pair at Gander Mtn for $20. They look good. I wore them every day for 3 weeks in Mexico. Dropped 'em off the peak of my cap twice and wore 'em in the pool at least half a dozen times. They came thru it all unscathed and still working great. I'll feel a whole lot better the day they fall into the lake or get sat on than if they had cost hundreds of bux.  JF

Something you may want to consider. The Maui Jim's with the titanium frame are sweet though, and will set you back $300. Revo's were 200-300+."

430672,hirk,2010-02-07 19:01:00,571,"One point nobody has touched on is how important lense quality really is.High optic quality means less/no eye strain and if you fish often you owe it too your eyes to wear good optic lenses (you only have 1 set of eyes).Maui's are the cream as far as optic quality,have been told by several optometrists."

Only prob is Bolle sold the brand to Serengeti and they're nowhere near as nice as they used to be.  Seeing as how my girlfriends damn puggle puppy just chewed my last Bolle pair I might give the Maui Jim's a shot."

Are there different levels of polarization allowing more glare reduction?  If so, lets hear of some of the brands people have.  I have heard maui jims are good but I don't think the styles are my cup of tea.  Oakley's, are they up there?  What is a good all round colour or any good brands that have interchangeable lens.  Thanks."
428777,steverowbotham,2010-02-02 19:56:00,1800, Bluewater Optics makes an excellent pair of sunglasses for a good price.

428787,Michael_Brown,2010-02-02 20:11:00,411,"I have Maui Jim's and by far the best lens I have ever used. I routinuely spot fish farther away then the people I fish with regardless of the brand they are wearing. I am in no way sponsored by them. I had an eye injury years ago and the eye doctor recommended them for the quality of the lens. Regardless of the brand you choose. Look for a glass lenses as they offer better quality, durablity and resist scratches better than the plastic/polycarbonate lenses. Granted the styles for plastic lenses are far more varied. I have amber coloured lenses and with .5 magnification. The warrenty is unbeatable. I cracked the frame a couple of years ago when I checked them with my baggage at the airport. The company sent me a new pair. Free.  Good luck."
428788,jayess,2010-02-02 20:17:00,187,"In my opinion, you get what you pay for. Buy a $50 pair, you're getting $50 sunglasses. Buy a $100+ pair, and in most cases you are getting a bit more for your money.  I'd recommend Oakley, personally. Mind you, I had a corporate discount at the time that I purchased mine but if I were to buy again, I would definitely check discount websites (backcountryoutlet.com, for instance) and other reputable retailers.  the particular model I got were the Hijinx. they feel lightweight, well-built and sturdy (not thin framed). I have the standard grey polarized lenses which aren't bad, but I tend to use the VR28 lenses for fishing as they seem to lighten up dark waters to my eyes.  check out the various lenses. click on 'lens tints' among the tabs halfway down the page. don't forget to change the background scene to get a feel for how each lens tint fares. http://www.oakley.com/pd/4812  Edit: I should add, these have interchangeable lenses."
428792,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-02 20:23:00,3761,If you are going prescription/polarized then you are looking at $300+. If you are just getting polarized glasses you should find a pair for under $100.  I had to get Prescription/Polarized sunglasses and they cost me $170 fort the frame and a little over $200 for the lenses...then a $40 fee to have them polarized.
428798,Paully,2010-02-02 20:42:00,712,"At the Spring fishing show you can get polarized shades for 20 bucks...I purchase from the same place each year... usually buy 2 or 3 pairs for the season.  If your like me with shades they always get scratched, bent, sat on, lost, twisted, stepped on, cracked, thrown in the fire, dropped in the lake, misplaced  ... and so on.  I find buying a few cheaper pairs is better than buying one pair thats 100 dollars."

428817,Syn,2010-02-02 21:17:00,519,"My personal preference: Wrap around lense that does not let in light from the sides because I find side light distracting. Light weight plastic lense fameless design.  big rubber nose pads and rubber or any soft ear shaft which sits on your ear, comfortable for all day use. Usually I get a dark polarized pair for sunny days for 30- $50 because I don't want to get stressed if I lose them or scratch them. Prefer the floating kind in case I drop them off the boat otherwise I use the sunglasses retainer that floats. UV A+B full protection is a given. Usually I find them at basspro and walmart. Don't like to buy from ebay much because I can't try them on first."

Still have them. Myself I see absolutely no difference in the polarizing aspect of them.  So I just can't justify to myself spending more money. When they are not on my face they are in a case so they don't get banged up, so lens quality is a none issue for me as well,cause I don't abuse them.  Personal preference is all it really comes down too. Get a pair that fits comfortably and they will be fine... whether you spend a lot or a little."

Had expensive ones before too, honestly didn't find them to be any better than a cheaper pair of polarized. And at $25  it isn't a great loss if they get lost or damaged."
