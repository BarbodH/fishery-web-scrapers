Sometimes they will eat the bait when it hits the water, ""IF"", you have to swith hands while ""pitching"" and sometimes ""casting"" there is a chance of a missed fish.  For pitching/flipping it is wise to use your strong arm on the rod.  It can be difficult to switch reels becasue your STRONG arm is usually the hand you write with.  Low profile baitcasters that are used for the majority of ""pitching"" have a motion similair to writing with a pencil.  So, when I switched to the left side reel 13 yrs ago now, I went to the Nuke and practiced on drum.  I feel 100% comfy using a lefty and I beleive it is truly an advantage.  IMHO.  Good Luck"

432036,JohnF,2010-02-11 00:40:00,3494, I agree. I want my dominant hand controlling the rod and my weaker hand cranking. That's why I don't get the logic of righties cranking a baitcaster right handed. I realize there's an historical precedent for it but I still don't get it. Of course I still don't understand why more righties don't want their power hand at the top of the golf club either.  JF

The only Abu 7000 series available in a lefty is the 7001i, no high speed or narrow spool options. I bought it anyways as it looked like a killer deal (used). Some of the high end reels are available in a lefty but you start getting into big coin. Alot of the saltwater reels seem to be righty only. Bass gear seems to be available in either left or right handed. I think the fact that the majority of reels are right handers  today kind of stems from tradition. I'd bet that half the guys today who reel right handers wouldn't if there had been a good selection of left handed reels back in the day."

429239,JohnF,2010-02-04 00:36:00,3494,I've been thinking that most natural righties who crank right are thumbing the reel with the right thumb. Hence the need to change hands. Now I'm getting the idea that some of you (most?) are thumbing with the left hand which means no switch.  If you're a natural lefty then I could see thumbing with the left hand. I'm confused.  And I'm not clear on why Garry says someone like me who thumbs right handed but cranks left is naturally going to hold the reel in the wrong position. What difference does it make whether the crank is up or down for the cast? Seems to me the important thing is for the reel itself not to be up so the wrist can get the proper flex action.  JF
429253,GoneFishin,2010-02-04 00:56:00,349," It's all about preference and style I guess. If you want to get the most out of your baitcaster then you need to be using a reel that corresponds with the hand you cast with. If you crank with you right hand then your going to have to cast with your left arm if you want to be able to use your reel to it's fullest. If you can't do that then you need to switch cranking arms. You can tell me until your blue in the face that it isn't a big deal to have to switch hands after casting. But when it comes down to it, you won't be able to cast as quickly and probably not as accurately, you won't be able to pick up your line as fast and good luck flipping and pitching all day haha.  I still crank with my right hand when I use a spinning set up, but I will never use a right handed baitcast reel. Only took a couple outing's for it to start to feel comfortable, and I'm very glad I decided to switch because it even makes my time on the water a lot more enjoyable."
429256,BillM,2010-02-04 01:04:00,17367," lol this is comedy gold...  Do people REALLY think switching hands makes a difference?   My right hand is the dominant hand, why would I want to cast with anything else?  It's all personal preference, nothing more.."

429430,Jer,2010-02-04 13:59:00,1426,"  I don't think anyone is talking about casting with their left hand (except for natural lefties), rather having a right-hand retrieve reel and casting with their right and having to switch hands to turn the handle.  I cast with my right arm and wind the handle with my left, regardless if I'm using a spinning or a baitcaster. My right being my dominant hand, I'd rather fight a fish with the rod in my right hand."
429437,BillM,2010-02-04 14:31:00,17367," Jer, read the post I replied to   I think you'll then figure out where I'm coming from."
429441,solopaddler,2010-02-04 14:42:00,8605,"  Wrong.  Switching hands is counterproductive and inefficient.  As you said your right is dominant, why would you want to cast with your left? Conversely why would you want to switch hands and hold the rod with your weaker left hand (your hook setting arm)?  Last Sept on the Attawapiskat tossing bucktails, most times the retrieve was started while the lure was still in the air. If you let the lure hit the water before starting your retrieve you'd end up with a clump of weeds on your hook. Try switching hands in mid cast and doing that.  I can understand why someone would use a right hand retrieve casting reel if all their other reels were also right hand retrieve. Most people, yourself included, use left hand retrieve reels for everything else and cast with the right hand. Makes no sense."
429453,BillM,2010-02-04 15:23:00,17367,"Mike, you'll have to prove how counterproductive and inefficient my casting is in June..  Let's just hope you can keep up"
429463,dave524,2010-02-04 15:47:00,4508,"Might depend on how you hold a bait rig too. I learned to fish with the old direct drive casters with the pistol grip offset reel handles. Dad taught me to cast in the late fifties, he was a very good tournament caster, won a few T.A.H.A. competions at the C.N.E., before there was even a Sportsmen Show. He'd set up hula hoops and my favourite target, the lid off the galvanized metal garbage can, gratifying clang when you hit that, in the back yard , the competition was called "" SKISH"". Anyway, being right handed we cast with our right and like everyone would transfer the rod to the left and reel with the right, but instead of gripping the rod handle, the left hand would grasp the rod ahead of the reel somewhat with my palm against the sideplate. To this day, I use the more forward grip while retrieveing. To use my favoured grip while holding the rod with my right would seem to necessitate tranferring the rod to my left and then repositioning my right hand above the reel, even more movement. I use the more common today straight grips but still grip the same as I learned. guess I've just done it too many years to change now.  Really this left hand reeling only started when fixed spool spinning gear started becoming popular in the fifties, before that everything was right hand reeling. The guys that grew up with spinning gear became accustomed to it and it's carried over to their casting gear."
429756,singingdog,2010-02-05 12:08:00,1047," You got that right....pretty much the entire thread. Everytime this thread pops up it is full of misconceptions and plain mistruths.  Using a RH baitcaster does not mean that you are casting with your left hand. (please repeat that until you understand it). The vast majority of folks using RH baitcasters cast with their right hand, then switch the rod to their left hand to reel with their right.  I always cast RH, but used both RH and LH baitcasters last season (it's a great way to relieve wrist stress). Unbelievably, I can switch hands and engage a lure (yes, even a bucktail) while it is still in the air. It's not that hard. I must be pretty bad with a baitcaster, because I get just as good casting performance with a LH reel as a RH reel.  Definitely some entertaining ""info"" in this thread."

429078,JohnF,2010-02-03 14:50:00,3494,I'm still learning baitcasting but I discovered the same thing. I like doing it left handed. In a pinch I can handle righty but prefer left. Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna toss the whole rig in the drink when I really snap one out the way I was taught. Perhaps it comes back to the hockey thing that they talk about in golf. So many of us grew up playing hockey left handed that we just find it natural. Hence so many left handed Canuck golfers. And perhaps that's why so many of us prefer left handed baitcasters.  I was talking to a tackle shop owner from New Jersey and he said that there's not much call for lefties in casting gear in his market. He figgered that was why I got such a good deal on the LH Calcutta in Ohio. There was a righty in the same model right beside it for $199.  What I've discovered is that to find LH ya gotta go slightly up the scale ladder. The cheaper reels are only RH. But then perhaps that isn't such a bad thing if it means we start out with slightly better equipment. By all accounts a crappy BC can sure ruin an otherwise nice day.  Keep yer eyes peeled. I've bought a Quantum Energy PTi (the rainbow looking one) and a Calcutta 201B for $100 each in the last year or so. By all accounts those are decent deals.  But I'm a neophyte. What do I know.  JF

Like scissors - when's the last time you saw a left handed pair?  Even though I use my left hand, I can't use left handed scissors (on the rare time that I find them) because I'm so used to the feel of a right handed scissor in my left hand.

429099,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-03 15:52:00,10439,I am also a Lefty. There are a lot more lefty baitcasters now than there used to be. Back in the 80's you could almost count the number available on one hand. Today it seems that most of the manufacturers are producing several left handed models.
429104,gogu392,2010-02-03 16:12:00,142,"Left hand handle here too. If you use your right hand in all daily activities you should buy a LH baitcaster. Why? Simple. You need the right hand (the most strong one) to do the heavy lifting/work and the week one to do the small job (reel). In past the baitcast where RH only (the reel was always in gear), today with clutch/gear, more and more are produced in LH. It is a pain in the ass to switch the rod from one hand to another, one more useless step. Try before to buy. See what you are confortable with. If you are Right handed the Left Handle is for you, and viceversa. Have fun."
429114,Garry2Rs,2010-02-03 16:46:00,1425,"It the days when the crank handle was always in gear, the handle would spin backward at high speed, during the cast.  This was a very good reason to put it on the right side of the frame out of the way of body and sleeves etc.  Casting right, switching hands and reeling right is easy and feels quite natural after a few minutes.  Ask anyone who does it and they will tell you that they generally change hands while the bait is still in the air.  Now it's none of my business if someone wants to become a Refty.  However, it's doubtful that they will reach their full potential bait casting with a wrong sided reel.  The reason is simply the design of the reel.  It's too hard to use the proper grip and get the proper casting stroke.  Refties teach themselves to cast with the reel on top of the rod and never get the power that could be generated with a better grip.  If you're curious about what I'm talking about, look up bait casting on line, or get a book from the Library.  It will show you proper form and the correct grip etc.  None of this means that a Refty won't have an enjoyable day on the water, so let them do it their own way."
429121,Raf,2010-02-03 17:15:00,3495," not sure what you mean by that garry.  when I cast the reel is off to the side, with the handle pointing up (or down) depending on where in the cast I am.  that would be a problem with the reels of yesteryear that had the handle that spun when you casted but they don't any longer."
429127,GoneFishin,2010-02-03 17:47:00,349,"Spinning you can get away with retrieving with your right hand, baitcaster not so much..  Bass pro most likely only has right handed reels because they are all sold out of left hand reel lol."
429137,mepps,2010-02-03 18:14:00,1301,I'm a lefty too! Never had trouble finding lefty reels though. Bass Pro brand and Cabelas brand are all righties (at least they used to be) but any other big brand should offer most of their reels in both.
429138,I'mHooked,2010-02-03 18:17:00,525,"Interesting read. The only thing I can do with my right hand is reel either a baitcast or spinner. I do everything lefty. Hockey, golf, swing a bat, writing, casting. Other then crankin' on the reel handle, I can't hold my toothbrush with my right hand.  I can't imagine having to switch hands to cast & retrieve. Seems so foreign."
429143,BillM,2010-02-03 18:39:00,17367,"Spinning reel - left hand, baitcaster - right hand, centerpin - left hand, golf - right hand, hockey -  left hand.  "
