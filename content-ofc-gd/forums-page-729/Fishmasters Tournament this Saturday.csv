431238,Sandbag,2010-02-09 01:09:00,533,"Just wondering if any other OFC'ers are heading to the grand for Fishmasters Tournament this Saturday.  Looks like the weather is going to co-operate this year again.  Was a great time two years ago, but the weather wasted it last year.  Would be happy to meet any other OFC'ers out there if your going.  Got a group of four or five heading out for the day.  Cheers  Craig"
