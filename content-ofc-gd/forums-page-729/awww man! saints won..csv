430898,redneck666,2010-02-08 02:56:00,563,"well, saints won as most of us know. we all knew colts were supposed to win!!!  great all around game though. very exciting!"
430943,waterwolf,2010-02-08 05:47:00,556,"great game..  manning was flipped, cocky gets you son!!!!"
430946,grt1,2010-02-08 07:24:00,638,"I had to be on call for midnights so I started taping the game at the end of the first quarter. It's now 1:30 am and just finished watching the tape. I was surprised the wife would watch the game for a second time, she must really like the commercials."
430983,redneck666,2010-02-08 14:55:00,563, that or it was such a great game she just HAD to see it again. haha.
431016,blaque,2010-02-08 16:30:00,2419,i took pleasure in seeing manning throw that pick.........maybe a few less commercials ill have to endure in the future.

431045,redneck666,2010-02-08 17:26:00,563, if i was playing the trumpet that hard i would probably die before i started sweating sweating like that!
431245,kingofthesteelhead,2010-02-09 01:22:00,140,"I think the saints defence was a little underrated and came up with the big plays when needed.Drew Brees,what more can I say,move over Peyton Manning who gets flustered too easy."
431331,fishinguypat,2010-02-09 04:12:00,547,if manning didn't make that bad pass i would have said they would have won..
431344,solopaddler,2010-02-09 06:58:00,8605," Agreed. Did you see the look on his face when the camera panned to him more than once on the sidelines? Every time, he was sitting there by himself with this weird grinch-like smirk on his face.  Was nice to see the smirk gone at the end of the game."
431376,Jonny,2010-02-09 14:20:00,1380,"Manning's a good QB - there's no denying that. Being down, and with time running out, he had to take chances on forcing the play.  It hurt the Colts defense considerably that Dwight Freeney wasn't quite up to speed on the pass rushes because of his injury.  I would have been OK with either team winning, but the Colts won a Super Bowl recently and the Saints needed it more."
431637,lucabrasi,2010-02-09 23:45:00,114,No more pleasure than I had in seeing Favre throw that pick two weeks ago. Now that was poetic. I hope that drama queen retires and stays retired this offseason.
431644,lucabrasi,2010-02-09 23:57:00,114," Yeah, what was it with that. He's been doing that since Caldwell pulled him from the Jets game essentially ending their quest for the perfect season. Really brooding-like. I thought he was gonna blow a gasket"
