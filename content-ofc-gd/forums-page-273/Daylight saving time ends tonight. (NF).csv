816293,Roy,2013-11-02 09:33:00,13728,So it's time to  turn our clocks BACK one hour tonight.  This also happens to be the perfect time to replace the batteries in all your battery operated smoke (and other) detectors. Check your battery stock today to make sure you have enough to cover all detectors. It's also a good idea to check the detector manufactured dates. Anything over 10 years old should be replaced. They're inexpensive and the peace of mind alone will be worth it.  Lecture done... have a great weekend.
816296,Aaron Shirley,2013-11-02 10:22:00,655,"Thanks for the heads up Roy! I forgot about the time change.  Good idea with the smoke and carbon monoxide detectors as well. I have lots of batteries around with young kids lol. Time to change the batteries, furnace filter etc."
816300,Fisherman,2013-11-02 11:38:00,7201,"Can't believe I was just teetering on the chair 6 months ago replacing batteries.  May as well get er done.  Costco has the bundle packs of 9V, so there's no excuse."
816301,kickingfrog,2013-11-02 11:41:00,8333,"As most parents know or are about to find out, what used to be a small pleasure BK (before kids) is now a giant pain in the butt."

816304,Handlebarz,2013-11-02 11:58:00,3790,Last year I bought all new smoke alarms they have 10 year batteries in them.
816306,kickingfrog,2013-11-02 12:15:00,8333,"ok I'm lost The little bit of ""extra"" sleep does not happen because young kids wake up at the same time regardless of what the clock says."
816307,Terry,2013-11-02 12:19:00,14456,a shot of rum solves that problem  lol  if administered to children   6 shots if self-medicating

816375,cram,2013-11-02 16:52:00,1733,Does that mean that Lew gets up at 3am tomorrow?
816378,lew,2013-11-02 17:22:00,12766,"Does that mean that Lew gets up at 3am tomorrow?  3 AM is normal, tomorrow should be about 2  It's when Roy and I share a morning internet coffee"
816379,Handlebarz,2013-11-02 17:24:00,3790,No at 2 because by 3 he will have had his third cup of coffee.  My wife hates this time of year as it throws me right off as I don't like the first two weeks getting used to the time change. I am normally up at 4am for work and now it will feel like 3abd that sucks. She does not understand as she gets up after its already day light and I have half my work day done.  I think it would be great to leave the time along year round.
816380,Handlebarz,2013-11-02 17:25:00,3790,Lol looks like I was slow on my typing skills above
816382,Twocoda,2013-11-02 17:34:00,4130,i might also add ....if you do not have freezless taps for your garden hose... its time to drain them by internally shuting them down
816887,mercman,2013-11-05 14:59:00,7054," 3 AM is normal, tomorrow should be about 2  It's when Roy and I share a morning internet coffee You guys get up at 2 in the blessed A.M ????????? I hope I never get old..............J.K"
