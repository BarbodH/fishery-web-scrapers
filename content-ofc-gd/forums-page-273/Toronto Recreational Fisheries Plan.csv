810297,TJQ,2013-10-01 17:40:00,7806,"Just got this in.. thought id share here.   The Ministry of Natural Resources and four Conservation Authorities – Toronto and Region, Credit Valley, Central Lake Ontario, and Ganaraska Region have initiated the preparation of an Urban Recreational Fisheries Plan for the Greater Toronto and Area. Other partners in the process are the municipalities, federal and provincial agencies and the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. The Urban Recreational Fisheries Plan effectively covers the north shore of Lake Ontario from the western border of the City of Mississauga extending to the eastern border of Durham Region. The plan will integrate information on the state of the fisheries and their habitat with existing plans and strategies to create a document to guide the partners and other interested parties in improving urban recreational fishing opportunities. The plan will look at improving access to shoreline fishing, taking a systematic approach to improving fish habitat, and promote the diverse fishing opportunities available along the waterfront. The fall meetings will present a draft of the plan to the public and it is important to get as many anglers and interested citizens as possible to the meetings to demonstrate that urban fishing is a vital interest to the fishing community. Public feedback will be incorporated into the plan, which is scheduled to be completed spring of 2014. Five public meetings have been scheduled around the Greater Toronto Area in October and November. The meetings will be similar but local issues will be discussed.

Hopefully a good crowd makes it out to show the agencies that urban fishing opportunities are important to anglers, even those who don't necessarily fish the waterfront but support increased opportunities for others.  Yours in Conservation, Chris Robinson OFAH Zone 20 (West) Representative (also on the technical team for this plan)"
813119,Dara,2013-10-16 15:49:00,3052,Sounds like a lot of high priced help to me
813133,Richie Razor,2013-10-16 17:10:00,536, Would you rather it be uneducated and unqualified personnel spearheading these projects?  Perhaps your more qualified?

813881,Ron,2013-10-20 09:23:00,1683,"Just thought I'd bump this up. I forgot to for the first meeting.  For anyone who fishes from shore on a stream or river, it would be of great benefit  to attend these meetings. Only anglers can show support for anglers. There have been several individual people who have fought to protect our rights as anglers yet very few ever attend these meetings to show support. Let the cities know that ""YES THERE IS URBAN FISHING OPPORTUNITIES""! Even if you don't fish from shore, come and support your fellow anglers. One day it will be all taken away if we don't stand together."

Tonight's meeting is in Ajax, hopefully we see more anglers out - this is a chance to be proactive in creating angling opportunities, rather than reactive when opportunities are taken away.

814949,John Bacon,2013-10-25 04:11:00,3277,"The Toronto meeting should be good.  I was at the Pickering meeting today.  We ended up talking a lot about Frenchman's Bay.  However, they also had quite a bit about the down town area.  There has been a lot of studying being down in that area.  I think they tailor the sessions somewhat to the location.  There should be an interesting discussion if you get a good turn out.  I think they have more info about that area."
