816347,Renegade67,2013-11-02 15:07:00,86,Just wondering if anyone could recommend some replacement pedestal seats.   There for a Lund Renegade.  I'm 230 and my brother is probably 280lbs.    Unfortunately I'm on a budget but will spend what it takes to keep my arse off the floor! I see what appears to be a decent big guy seat at Bass Pro; http://www.basspro.com/Wise-Blast-Off-Tour-Series-17-Center-Buddy-Boat-Seats-WD-1455/product/10226913/ These would be top of the mark in terms of cost. Comments?
816348,John Bacon,2013-11-02 15:18:00,3277,I think pretty well any of the standard seats should support your weight.  The pedestal would be more critical than the seat in terms of supporting weight.  The only ones that you should avoid would be the offset pedestals that are designed to give you some extra leg room.  I wouldn't trust them to hold 280 pounds.

816537,Renegade67,2013-11-03 13:45:00,86,Thanks for the replies.  Those Tempress seats look great and have favourable reviews.   Being about 25 bucks each cheaper than the ones I've been eyeing is a bonus as well.   Perhaps I should spend the difference on better pedestals?  There are so many.  I would like air for the captain.  The others could use pin/clip.   Any suggestions?
816556,Steve,2013-11-03 16:20:00,2075,"try to find seats without any plastic.  i replaced my original lund seats with the new lund seats two seasons ago.  the ""new"" seats are already showing wear after two seasons.  that would be my advice - no plastic!"
816560,Tybo,2013-11-03 16:40:00,1373,"I have the ergonomically contour seats. They cost more, but they maybe the comfortable boat seat I have sat in. With the shape of them your back doesn`t have a large area against the seat so your back sweats less."
816571,BillM,2013-11-03 19:01:00,17367,"Tybo, which seats are you using in your ProV?   Ours are getting a bit worn and I was looking at something with maybe a spring setup in the base to give the oldman a bit more comfort."
816588,Tybo,2013-11-03 21:28:00,1373,Attwood centric with swivl-eze power pedestals. Height adjustment is good and the oil accumulator helps with alot of the shock. 5 year and holding up quite well.
