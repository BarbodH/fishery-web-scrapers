815488,ChasinTails,2013-10-29 01:56:00,90,"when i show up, the fish stop biting"
815493,Gallie,2013-10-29 02:15:00,1215,"I like the superstitions, keeps things fun No bananas. No sunscreen gas or bug spray on the hands, if your trolling dont watch the rod because you will catch nothin. Salmon trolling requires talking laughing screwing around whatever it takes to not look at the rods. Never ever leave the scale it, for us this is the death blow for salmon, we have never caught a mature if the scale is not in the bottom of the tackle box where it belongs. Also keep the pliers close at hand. Whew thats a lot, and theres more but we'll stick with those since every man has to have his secrets"
815495,i2cool2fool,2013-10-29 02:17:00,349,I always bring tuna sandwiches so I always have fish in the boat. My father in law always brings egg salad sandwiches (no exceptions - ever).
815546,manjo39,2013-10-29 16:01:00,354,"NEVER put water in the livewell before the first catch. If you fill it before a fish goes in you are sure to be driving a water tank with no fish in it around the lake all day long.  NEVER make special accomidations to go get a camera or a net that was forgotten. If you turn around to get your camera or your net that you forgot at home you are sure to be skunked.    I always thought that if I forgot something, all hope of catching fish was lost.  Even if I don't go get it, I still forgot it and its bad luck."
815689,hawk-eye,2013-10-30 05:58:00,141,Never leave the dock without checking the fuel.  The one time i forgot was not a good day.
815718,manitoubass2,2013-10-30 13:07:00,11391,Tobacco in the water before a line hits the water. Thats it

816084,Sinker,2013-11-01 03:55:00,8692,We used to call that a fish whistle. Works like a charm!  S.

816119,highdrifter,2013-11-01 15:20:00,2534,We used to call that a fish whistle. Works like a charm!  S.  Bahahah!!  Right on mang.
816141,mpt,2013-11-01 16:20:00,158,Years back when there were smelt and I was in college. The local tradition was to bite the head off the first one caught. One year in the middle of a big run a guy dove in to get his smelt and came out with a fair sized steelhead. Took him quite a while to accomplish this feat and nobody told him it wasn't a smelt.
816259,RiverGuy,2013-11-02 02:10:00,19,I always wet my feet before the first cast and I never use a fresh leader until after the first cast
816269,kickingfrog,2013-11-02 02:46:00,8333,And I thought bingo players had some crazy superstitions.

789253,sofabed,2013-05-30 01:50:00,119,I never have the net ready. It is stored in the bottom of the boat. I usually lose the first fish of the day trying to get the net out
789259,mercman,2013-05-30 02:03:00,7054,LOL !!!! I knew you were gonna say that !!!! He is serious guys. I have been warned by Mike to never ever ever bring a banana on his boat in my lunch. !
789260,mercman,2013-05-30 02:06:00,7054,here http://tailhunter-international.com/bananas.htm
789262,Christopheraaron,2013-05-30 02:07:00,3525,"Yup, banana's are a no-no. Although one day I put a chunk of banana on a hook and caught a sunfish and perch"
789629,alphaalpha,2013-05-31 20:48:00,475,"not sure but for some reason i like to set my downriggers on the one's. ie: 51', 61', etc and same with my dipsy lines out 151 161 etc.  also 123' of line out seems lucky"
789914,glen,2013-06-02 03:56:00,2641,I don't like it when people bring bananas onboard.  Some people really gobble them down.
789935,bigcreekdad,2013-06-02 12:31:00,546,"If the volcano above your favorite spot is erupting fishing will be poor.  If a crocodile attacks your surface plug, you will lose your interest in fishing for a week.  If an old man with a harpoon suddenly appears in the bow of your boat and is pointing at a white whale....get the hell out there!!  "
789938,kickingfrog,2013-06-02 12:54:00,8333,No body has told the fish I catch about the banana thing either.
789939,Rich,2013-06-02 12:58:00,3927,"Superstitions are masks of confidence, so best thing to bring would be your determination I'd say."
789948,lew,2013-06-02 13:18:00,12766,I think the silliest superstition is the one where someone actually thinks a silly superstition will actually have an effect on your days fishing success
789955,FloatnFly,2013-06-02 13:33:00,1640,"  you're right, its why everyone goes to their ""lucky lure"" when the fishing gets slow"
790343,Floren Lukatsky,2013-06-04 12:53:00,23,bananas were always big for me. add me to that list
790390,mike rousseau,2013-06-04 16:45:00,4661,I think for most it's more about a funny story or ongoing joke...  It adds to the fun of fishing....
790392,Dave Bailey,2013-06-04 16:55:00,1641,I think it's high time that someone made a lure that looks like a banana...
790393,Acountdeleted,2013-06-04 17:01:00,2562,"I have to always say 'last cast' for my last cast of the outing. And regardless what I catch on that last cast, it must be the last cast."
790431,dhickey,2013-06-04 21:11:00,1038,I wash my hands and feet at the shoreline with mud or sand no soap as soon as I get to it. Then set up the boat before my 2nd beer.
790466,kickingfrog,2013-06-04 22:44:00,8333,"ahem, spots and all:  "

790638,Whitespinnerbait,2013-06-05 16:10:00,2038,I always bring Bananas in the boat......brings good luck !!
789038,FloatnFly,2013-05-29 03:33:00,1640,"Title says it all, so lets hear em  Mine is I can't use a brand new setup, has to be old rod with new reel, or new rod with an old reel, my theory is the new gear doesn't know how to catch fish yet, so it needs to absorb from the old gear."
789039,BillM,2013-05-29 03:33:00,17367,"I don't like a fish on the first cast of the day, other then that I really don't have any."

789106,snagged,2013-05-29 14:46:00,67,Never heard of this one before. I hear handling oranges leaves a scent on the fingers that fish don't like. Not sure if there is any truth to this though.
789107,bow slayer,2013-05-29 14:51:00,1074,"I can not count how many times I hooked a fish on first drift or cast,then nothing the rest of the day.
