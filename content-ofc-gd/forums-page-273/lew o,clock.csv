816513,outllaw,2013-11-03 10:11:00,1232,"morning folks. been up 2 hours now. anyone else messed up time wise. LEW feel free to ring in. is it lew o,clock. dam time changes"
816516,fishindevil,2013-11-03 11:17:00,6254,Yes been up since 3am !!!! But that was really 2am !!!! Grrr.... Ya the time change always screws me up as 3am is my normal time for work and it ends up being my fishing time on weekends too!!! So at least it's consistent !!! Hahah lol
816517,lew,2013-11-03 11:31:00,12766,"It's never bothered me one way or another if it's daylight savings or not, the earlier I get up the more I like it. LOL"
816518,Handlebarz,2013-11-03 11:32:00,3790,I still get up at the same time but it does mess me up for doing stuff during the day like work if im up sitting around waiting to start my day its not good I get tired just sitting around I have to get up shower and go.
816520,krixxer,2013-11-03 11:55:00,274,I gave up on the time change a few years back. Don't see any point to it!  ... not having to deal with stupid winter traffic is just a reward for waking up early!
816522,npt1,2013-11-03 12:13:00,220,"I don't a problem with this time change,  its the other one when we lose an hours sleep that gets me all twisted up. Takes me about a week to adjust."
816529,Handlebarz,2013-11-03 12:38:00,3790,Well I feel very bad as my dog has been sitting beside me since 7:10am look at this sad face he has been waiting for breakfast which is at 8:30am well not today. It's hard to look at this face for the next hour until its feeding time today. Poor guy did not understand it when I tried to explain it to him that his stomach is wrong I even showed him the time on my phone but he does not believe me and is still waiting. He has since moved to the doorway still sitting waiting for me to get up. Yes this time change does affect some in a bad way lol. 
816531,NAW,2013-11-03 12:49:00,4022,My son has woke up at 4:57 every day for the last 4 days.  No change this morning.  Sept it was 3:57 today. Argh!!!
816550,Beans,2013-11-03 15:23:00,3339,Nobody told Chiquita about the time change...She thought it was 07:00 am (06:00am new time) the regular time for her morning constitutional ...   
816687,pics,2013-11-04 10:26:00,1268,The worst part of it was having to work 13 hours Saturday night instead of 12.. otherwise an hour makes no real difference to me because I work nights and days in the same week. I spend half my days off feeling like a truck hit me
816688,fishindevil,2013-11-04 10:50:00,6254,I usually get up for work at 3:00am but now it's 2:00am !!!!! ...... I hardly sleep as it is and to loose an hour is brutal for me ...
816851,fishindevil,2013-11-05 07:17:00,6254,See it's 2:15am and I'm Wide awake !!!! It's way before Lew o'clock now !!!!!! Once I'm awake there is no going back to sleep ...... Time for a coffee
816853,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-05 09:15:00,8243,"Pics, I hear you. Worked I can't remember how many years of shifts, around 20, 13 years of 21 turns 8 hours shifts with rotating days off then about 7 of that was the 12 hour T schedule. That doesn't include the shifts in the steel plant on weekends and summers in High School.  I really didn't like Sunday day shift especially the 2 I didn't reset the clock for and relieved Hutch an hour early. Duh. The crew knew about it before they punched in.  A hour every 6 months is nothing when you have a time change every few days going from nights to days on the T schedule like Pic says. Jet lag? Every week we had jet lag. It takes my wife 2 weeks to get acclimatized, she was up at 5 this morning to get to work at 08:30, poor doll. If she has to travel to the east or west coast forget about it.  The absolute worst was pulling a 16 hour night and day shift then doubling back 8 hours latter at 23:00  It did come with an overtime meal allowance though, never knew if you wanted bacon and eggs or a pizza, or what day it was, or what month, or what year. I think I've embellished a bit, of course I knew what year it was. I never did get the license number of the Mack truck that hit me though."
816854,Squid,2013-11-05 09:52:00,1656,That ia so funny Mike. Milo was pining for a walk at 8AM on Sunday morning lol as we usually take him for a walk at 9am.
