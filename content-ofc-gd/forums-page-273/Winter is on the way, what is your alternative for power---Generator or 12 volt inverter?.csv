816077,Raf,2013-11-01 03:29:00,3495,"No worries, kids adapt just like adults. Of course it required some work on the parents end. But big deal its highly rewarding for all if they know their stuff. That being said, life in the city without power must really suck  we're not in the city either.  i think someways it would be easier in one  of course we can adapt and survive.. did fine last year without power and we'd be fine again this year with just our wood stove and no generator but if i have the means and the option of running my own hydro to make it that much easier, why not?"

816081,danc,2013-11-01 03:37:00,4677,Warm clothes and sleeping bags.  I do have a natural gas fireplace.  Even though the fire is turned on and off via and electrical switch; it does seem to work during a power outage.  I am not sure how that works. Mililvolt system. Your pilot light generates enough electricity to run the gas valve on your appliance.
816086,John Bacon,2013-11-01 04:27:00,3277,"Mililvolt system. Your pilot light generates enough electricity to run the gas valve on your appliance.  Thanks, does this utilize the thermocoupler that controls the safety for the pilot light?"
816088,Old Man,2013-11-01 04:56:00,822,"I'd throw off the grid main breaker and switch on my back up main and run the essentials on my 6500 watt backup generator. Back up power runs the oil burner for the boiler and the circulating pumps as well as the well pump; one fridge, and select lighting and outlets in the house. Our stove is gas , so I've got all the essentials covered."
816094,fishindevil,2013-11-01 09:19:00,6254,Well I have a Hyundai 4300w gas generator and a big propane BBQ. !!!! And fish in the freezer I am good to go !!!!!!! As we speak the power just went out !!!! Hahaha ..... Great timming
816096,lew,2013-11-01 09:57:00,12766,"I've got a 10,000 watt permanent stand-by generator that fires up automatically when the power goes out, and shuts itself off when the power is restored. Runs all the essentials including furnace, sump pump, well pump, fridge & freezer, most of the lights and even a couple TV's and the puter. It has an installed  trickle charger to keep the battery good and a warming blanket to keep it warm so it's always ready and I've got a 1500 litre propane tank to keep it fed.  When the power goes out I don't really even notice it except for the few seconds delay till the generator fires up and the way that wind is howling right now, today could be the day.  My stove & water heater are propane, plus I have a propane fireplace in the living room and downstairs in the family room, there's an airtight wood stove that will warm the whole house and there's 3 cords of dried & split harwood all set to go.  I spose we could all survive like our ancestors did on the praries 150 years ago, but when modern technology is readily available, I'll take warm and comfy any day"
816112,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-01 14:04:00,8243,Thank goodness for Natural gas. We did have a spring storm that killed power a few years back for 5 days and nights. Other than some cabin fever and Zebra Mussels covering the lake facing windows we were good to go. Snow plows had to come out and clear the Lakeshore roads of deadfall. Kind of like this morning! Looking at 3 to 4 meter waves right now hitting the breakwall.
816254,danc,2013-11-02 01:46:00,4677," Thanks, does this utilize the thermocoupler that controls the safety for the pilot light? John. You'll will have two modules in direct contact with the pilot light. One is the thermocouple and the other is a thermopile millivolt generator. Or you may have only one module that serves both funtions. Bottom line is that the millivolt generator produces enough power to operate the gas valve, thus no need for ac power to operate your appliance."
816029,npt1,2013-11-01 01:18:00,220,"Hi Everyone.  With the snow just around the corner, the ice storms are sure to follow. That means power outages for us all at some point. What is your backup method for establishing hydro at your residence? Why have you chosen the way you have to fix the temporary issue ? Also, what is your preferred source of heat when the power is out?"
816032,Rod Caster,2013-11-01 01:26:00,5784,"I'm at the mercy of HydroOne and several kilometers of gravel road for electricity, but I have wood/propane heat and a propane oven, If I can stay warm and eat...good enough haha."

816035,Fisherman,2013-11-01 01:33:00,7201,"Generator.  Unless you have a healthy sized battery bank, a 12 volt inverter won't cut the mustard. Then you need to recharge the batteries if it lasts more than a day or intermittently. I always have a couple of gallons of fresh gas that gets rotated, so the genny can always be fired up.  Preferred source of heat would be a wood burner but I don't have that setup.  I can disconnect my furnace from the power panel so there's no backfeeding into the grid and injuring anyone.  A freezer will keep cold for at least 24 hours if you keep the door shut.  If it's cold enough outside, frozen food can be stored in containers outside, same with some of the sutff from the fridge. Remember that whatever a 120vac appliance uses in amps, it uses 10 times that much on a 12vdc inverter.  That doesn't include the extra start up draw on motorized items, such as compressors for fridges, freezers, furnaces, water pumps, sump pumps, etc."

816043,danc,2013-11-01 01:55:00,4677,Not a big fan of OPG but I've never had to depend on anything else. And it gets cold here.
816047,BillM,2013-11-01 02:11:00,17367,Not to worried about being without power.
816048,Entropy,2013-11-01 02:13:00,747,"Wood stove (lots of wood, and way to get more), kerosene lamps (lots of kerosene), 4000 watt portable generator with extension cords.  I've got 3 days of gas on hand for genny plus fuel for snow blower and chain saw.  Deep cycle battery and 700 watt inverter to power internet tower and telephone for when I don't want to plug in the generator.  My generator uses 10 L of gas in 10 hrs at half load.  If I want to last 3 days running 24 hrs a day at half load, that = 1 L gas per hour, so 3 days x 24 hrs = 72 Liters of gasoline for just 3 days.  Makes you think what you would need for 2 weeks, eh. 14 x 24 = 336 Liters!  Entropy"

We do have access to a hydraulic splitter though and cords upon cords of wood. We already live in the bush and if we need to, we are fine food heat and water wise.
