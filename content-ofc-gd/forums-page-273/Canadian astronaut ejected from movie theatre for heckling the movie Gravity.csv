815920,mattybculp,2013-10-31 16:41:00,388,I like the part where its all quiet in the theatre and he lets one rip. Hahahaha.
815963,Big Cliff,2013-10-31 21:06:00,6899,Bull poop!
815973,SirCranksalot,2013-10-31 21:23:00,3291, The ability to precisely control your farts must be a dis-stink advantage in a space suit!!
816036,Joeytier,2013-11-01 01:40:00,3990,Thats just ridiculously funny...cant help but doubt the legitimacy of it but absolutely hilarious nonetheless
816038,fishing n autograph,2013-11-01 01:42:00,2540,That's weird because he was at TIFF watching the movie's debut and loved the movie. He even asked the director how he made it look so real
816039,Rod Caster,2013-11-01 01:45:00,5784,"Eventually, theatre staff was notified, and the Canadian living legend was loudly removed from the cinema. Witnesses report that he did not go quietly. One patron recalled, “The last thing I heard him yelling was, ‘Have you been to space? Because I’ve been to space!’”  I cried a little reading that."
816040,Joeytier,2013-11-01 01:45:00,3990,"The last paragraph kills me.  Cant help but think that is a marketing ploy for the movie, and a brilliant one at that."
816128,Mike Pike,2013-11-01 15:47:00,1332,"Yikes, I guess we now know the long term effects of working in outerspace!"
816137,ch312,2013-11-01 16:13:00,1590,"I guess I'm the only one who thought he acted like an idiot? Not only was he ruining the movie for everyone else in the theater and acting like a complete ass, the ‘Have you been to space? Because I’ve been to space!’” comment sure makes it seem like his 15 seconds of fame got to his head...  Maybe I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed today?"
816143,John Bacon,2013-11-01 16:23:00,3277,I am pretty sure this is a fake story.  I have a really hard time believing that there is any truth to it.
816150,Rod Caster,2013-11-01 16:42:00,5784,Of course it's fake hahaha. Very funny
816201,Dave Bailey,2013-11-01 20:33:00,1641,"The Beaverton is Canada's version of The Onion, and that one's an instant classic!"
816203,grizzlybri,2013-11-01 20:45:00,565,you can tell tis a fake story by reading some of the other stories on the right of the page
816222,SirCranksalot,2013-11-01 22:27:00,3291,"Oh, Ok. So just slightly less reliable than the Toronto Sun then!!"
816232,Rizzo,2013-11-01 23:24:00,4754,glad to hear its fake. I'm thinking this guy is a HUGE loser. Like when has Hollywood EVER portrayed something accurately?
816233,kickingfrog,2013-11-01 23:44:00,8333,Funny thing is I do that all the time. Sports movies. Car chases. Shoot em ups. Fight scenes.
816297,Rich,2013-11-02 10:24:00,3927,Likely just as often as the news.
