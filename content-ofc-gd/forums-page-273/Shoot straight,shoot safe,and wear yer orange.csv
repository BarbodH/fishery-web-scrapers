All packed and ready for the road come the morning. All those heading out,shoot straight and shoot safe and wear yer orange..   I,ll be hunting with my pop for the next few days.Like I tell many,it,s not the harvest,but the time spent with familyand,friends. The harvest,is the bonus shared by all..  Hope I wont be eating ""tag soup"" this year."
