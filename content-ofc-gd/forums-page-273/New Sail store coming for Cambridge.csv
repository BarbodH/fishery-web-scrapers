816422,kickingfrog,2013-11-02 21:54:00,8333,Sorry if this has been previously mentioned but I heard of a new Sail store coming to Cambridge. Didn't hear as to when or where.

816424,landry,2013-11-02 21:58:00,1005,Gonna be in Hespeler by zebra on holiday inn dr I hear. 5 min from me. That's gonna be a problem.
816553,Steve,2013-11-03 15:45:00,2075,"there are / ""were"" a number of good local shops in the KW / Cambridge area.  This wont be good.  I know many on this board will support, even praise, big box fishing stores ---- but I don't."
816614,landry,2013-11-03 22:49:00,1005,"There are no well stocked stores in Cambridge. There r some in kitchener and Guelph. Personally, I  am happy to see a Sail store here."
816639,danbouck,2013-11-04 00:30:00,4380,I won't comment on the local stores but this makes me very very very happy.
816668,Canuck2fan,2013-11-04 03:18:00,1444,Saying Sail is well stocked is reaching a bit if you ask me. My only experience with Sail was the Burlington Store and it sure didn't seem to realize the importance of river fishing for chrome from what I saw there. If you have a boat and like chasing bass it seemed to have some good deals.  I think the other stores have their niche and should survive if they keep up what they are doing.
816691,Rich,2013-11-04 11:15:00,3927,Steelheading is pretty specialized man.. have you seen BPS Vaughan's joke of a musky selection?  Supply and demand.. there are more people bass fishing now than ever in this country.
816703,LeXXington,2013-11-04 13:54:00,1928,"always worry when stores expand so quickly,  seems they end up going bankrupt just a fast"
816723,kickingfrog,2013-11-04 15:44:00,8333,"I've been wondering the same thing. It's not as if the economy is booming right now, but you'd think that someone who knows these things would be advising them so what do I know???"
