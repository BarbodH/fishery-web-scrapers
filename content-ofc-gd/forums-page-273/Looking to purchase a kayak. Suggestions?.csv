816475,Locnar,2013-11-03 00:48:00,645,"Hello fellas, I've been thinking about purchasing a fishing kayak for a little bit now... and I think during the winter or early spring I may pick one up. Any suggestions? I'm looking for something probably in the $800-1200 range, relatively light (50-70 lbs) so I can man handle it on top of the car by myself... Probably looking for a 10 footer, maybe 12 at most. And where would you suggest buying from?  Thanks again."
816476,Acountdeleted,2013-11-03 00:54:00,2562,"http://www.paddleshack.ca/muskoka/kayaks/fishing_crossover.php  Highly highly recommended. Wait until they go on sale. I was able to get mine for just under $1000. Held me and 2 buddies weighing over 200 pounds each. Had me and a buddy who was 250+ both sitting on the same side of the boat. Super comfortable and can take toooooons of add ons (captains chairs, rod holders, trolling motor).   Bonus: Paddle shack is in Muskoka. Go ice fishing the day you pick it up."
816477,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-03 00:59:00,10439,Go for the 12 footer at least. Longer yaks are faster paddling and better if the waves get up.  I'm picking one up in March and have decided on this one: http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=20973116&cp=4406646.4413993.4417832.4417969  Take a trip across the border to Barfalo and hit up Dicks down there.; )  If you have the $$ though I would drop them on one of these: http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=1246706&catalogId=10001&langId=-1&storeId=11151&storeNum=50596&subdeptNum=50620&classNum=50621#.UnWftPmfjNE

816514,singingdog,2013-11-03 10:34:00,1047,"What kind of water are you planning on fishing with the yak? Small, sheltered lakes, or do you want to be able to fish bigger water as well?"
816532,Locnar,2013-11-03 13:04:00,645,"Probably mostly smaller lakes and the kawarthas. And if the weather and time is right, maybe Lake O."
816696,singingdog,2013-11-04 11:59:00,1047,"Buy the yak that you will use 90% of the time, not one that you think you will use the other 10%. If you are going to fish primarily smaller water, then I would look at a smaller boat: 12' range.  Weight: SOTs are heavier than either SIK (traditional yaks) or hybrids (look more like canoes: WS Commander, Native Ultimate). SOT's, on the other hand, are the safest of the 3 types of boats. They won't take on water, are easier to self rescue, and generally sit lower in the water so that wind affects them less. IF I were going to own just one fishing yak, it would definitely be a SOT.  Keep an eye on Kijiji. Better yet, join yakfisher.net: lots of Ontario yakfishers there. There is a Jackson SOT on the classifieds board there that fits your needs."
816713,bow slayer,2013-11-04 15:06:00,1074,"I will add to what has already been said ,you want a sot for fishing,and probably a tandem incase you bring a partner, As also mentioned check kijiji,thats where I picked mine up from,barely used,less than a year old for half of what buddy paid for it."
