I checked price for new one and was really surprised - it's  between $50 and $60. In my opinion is too expensive. I would like to know if anybody is using any alternative covers. I checked ebay, but didn't find anything. I will pull hut myself, so my friend said you don't need one, but I don't like that idea. I was trying to buy used one, but nobody has it.  Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you "

I was in SAIL and was walking by the Normark ice fishing hut and noticed one of there 2 man was laid out exactly like my Clam Nanook. Took a chance and bought the Normark and it fit like a glove. Normark sells a single Cruzer hut 60""x45"" so check your dimensions and maybe it'll do at much lower price  I made a cover for my single Frabill and it was way too much work for what they are worth and still doesn't fit that good"
