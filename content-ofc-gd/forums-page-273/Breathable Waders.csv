814837,Moosebunk,2013-10-24 21:19:00,3970,"While it snowed and blowed all around it dawned on me sitting in my float tube this afternoon that I need new waders.  When getting into the water, Immediately I felt the little leak in the left foot.  Arriving at the other end of the lake it became apparent there was a leak in the left knee too.  Short while later, my left cheek and kiwi felt the chill of cold water.  Ending back at the truck, I dumped a bucket of cold water out of the left leg and felt the Arctic air drying off my junk before heading home.  Best waders I ever had were Bushland Neoprenes but they're just too warm in the summer.  Bought Orvis and Misty River and they might have been the exact same waders except the name and price tag.  Both lasted about 3-4 years each.  Any solid recommendations for a reasonable price???  "
814839,Terry,2013-10-24 21:23:00,14456,did this water that  ended up in your waders have a yellow  colour to it
814841,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-24 21:24:00,10439,I3-4 years isn't too bad. I got 6 years out of my last pair of Simms G3 Guide waders. Sent them in and they fixed 'em up and they are backups now. I have a new pair of G4 Guide waders that get the most use.
814857,BillM,2013-10-24 22:11:00,17367,"Yup, 2 pairs of waders is a must.  You'll always get leaks, nice to have some warm backups."
814868,Bondar,2013-10-24 22:56:00,817,"Check sierra trading post.com The have great deals Redington sonic pros for just over $200 and Patagonias also some simms if you catch the right day they have promo codes for up to or more than another 30% off worth a shot. I've bought from there without issues, I had bare blackwater II for 4 years and they just started to leak so I aqua sealed them for back ups and bought simms g4s time will tell on those though"
814875,Moosebunk,2013-10-24 23:37:00,3970,You'd all likely wear yours more than I do in a season.  Except you Mr. Whizz kid Terry. lol.   Two for Simms so far... and a Redington.  Tribbin' is a coming soon... I'm still thawing out from today.
814944,FloatnFly,2013-10-25 03:28:00,1640,"simms freestone....best waders under 300, extremely confortable, great warranty, just wear a pair of long johns under your pants if you want to stay toasty"
814946,NANUK,2013-10-25 03:44:00,797,"I own Patagonia Rio Gallegos. and SIMMS G4 Pro. very happy with both. Both companies have lifetime warranties, Patagonia has the best customer service."
814947,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-25 04:03:00,0,for the price i've always liked cabelas.  my primary pair is a set of bare gold and they are the bees knees.
814948,asmodan,2013-10-25 04:06:00,7,+1 for Redington sonic pros got mine on the ebay from Quebec (fly shop) for 200$
815049,JoshS,2013-10-25 22:21:00,729,I use mid level cabelas and they're pretty good. Plus they go on sale all the time. Had them leak once and sent them back for a new pair no questions asked.
815114,FloatnFly,2013-10-26 11:38:00,1640,"best thing to do, go to the store, try on a bunch, buy the ones that fit and feel the best"
815280,tip-up,2013-10-27 03:27:00,94,Just bought the Freestones by Simms and they are great!
815281,Paulus,2013-10-27 03:29:00,522,"Simms & Patagonias are probably at the top of the heap. Simms G3s are likely going to be my next purchase, whenever my current pair gives up the ghost.  That said, aquaseal will prolong the life of your waders, if all that's wrong with them is a few pinholes or a bit of stitching on a seam. I have a 10 year old bootfoot pair of Orvis Silver Labels that would have been in the garbage a long time ago, if it wasn't for aquaseal. As it is, they are my backups - or my gotos if I'm fishing before work. My current pair are Dan Baileys which have a zip front and are tough as nails (have them since 2009) and have at least 2 more years in them (for me...); but they are so-so for breathability.  If you want to try to fix them, Simms has a great set of videos to show you how to go about it. I ""recharged"" the breathability of my DB's this pas Spring, using these tips - it worked.  http://http://www.simmsfishing.com/support/repairs.html  Then, you can still get a new pair, but keep the old ones ""in case.""  p.-"
815936,Moosebunk,2013-10-31 19:33:00,3970,Thanks guys for your input and providing options for this.  Over the winter too will have to see what can be done with at least one of the two pairs I still have.  Some wader TLC.  Thanks for the tips P.
815955,Christopheraaron,2013-10-31 20:43:00,3525,I'll second the simms freestones.
816053,BillM,2013-11-01 02:43:00,17367,"Freestones are nice, they were my first pair (and currently my backup set).. Currently running G3's."
816089,chefboi17,2013-11-01 05:05:00,128,"As nice as Simms waders appear in stores, i can't personally justify the price. I just got myself a pair of LL bean Kennebec waders, they were about 230$ shipped (on sale at the time) and they feel great, and with anything LL bean, they are coverred for life. pretty much every pair of waders is going to leak at some point in their use, so being able to find and fix leaks is a great skill to have."
816092,John Bacon,2013-11-01 07:13:00,3277,I think my Cabela's 5mm neoprenes are about 20 years old now.  Still no leaks.
816295,Aaron Shirley,2013-11-02 10:19:00,655,"Hey Bunk, I have a breathable pair of Rapala waders and love them. One of the best waders i have owned, no bull. I have been using them this year and they are great waders. They are only around $180. I am curious to see how long they last before leaking. So far they seem to be built well.  I have never paid more than a couple hundred bucks for waders that don't last longer than a few years. I do too many different types of fishing to blow $500. on just waders. I'm sure the Simms are great, and I know lots of guys that use them and love them. I have tried many different types of waders, and they all do the same thing. Best thing is to get comfortable waders for you that work well and perform for the price point that you wish. I have used cheap breathables for $100. and will not get those again, despite lasting a few years. They were not comfortable lol.  Here is a link to the Rapala waders if you are interested: X-Protect  Ecowear"
