816110,Hairpy,2013-11-01 13:44:00,73,"Most likely with all the wind and rain , might be better above the power dams"
816117,Joey,2013-11-01 15:06:00,9122,Probably!
816207,Bondar,2013-11-01 21:13:00,817,"Yes it will be, should clear up around June.........."
816285,hawk-eye,2013-11-02 03:57:00,141,"Its more about strenght then direction. Big waves stirs it up and what gets stirred up in Erie comes down the Niagara. Check out coastwatch imagery, if you see brown where Niagara meets Ontario then its pretty much shot."
816298,Aaron Shirley,2013-11-02 10:26:00,655,"Yep, muddy water on the Niagara for sure.  Wiser! hahaha. Too funny. Sadly, almost true. I always count on November and December being shot most days now. Whatever happened to the glory days with cleaner water and less wind???  Hope we get a cold winter to freeze up the eastern basin on Erie this year..."
