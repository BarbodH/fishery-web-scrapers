816753,camillj,2013-11-04 19:21:00,1988,Nice report ... sorry about the hat
816760,kickingfrog,2013-11-04 19:48:00,8333," I used to get quite a laugh out of ordering OV. The case would roll out of the back and I would have to blow the dust off of it, before I took it to my car! HH In spite of our thoughts about it, lots of people must still buy because otherwise they would have stopped making it long ago. Maybe I should pick up a case next time I stop in to the beer store."
816779,2 tone z71,2013-11-04 21:04:00,1311,Great Report !!! close to home too
816783,davey buoy,2013-11-04 21:20:00,5505,"That's 2 hours or so from where I am,I DO need to get there for a weekend next season .Love the report."
816830,stasbrute,2013-11-05 00:48:00,206,"As for hitting rocks, I have done so in that area, caution is advised. The water was as high as I have seen it in many years, much higher than this past the spring, hope it stays that way.  http://youtu.be/XMXq2-MFhCk"
816362,stasbrute,2013-11-02 16:23:00,206,"Made it up to Kenlea Camp at ""The Baril"" last weekend, the weather was typical for this time of year, cold windy and wet. The fishing was good, as usual for this time of year as well. We packed light .......   My brother got a nice 40"" pike the first day.      our Friday keepers....  Saturday morning there was a surprise in our minnow bucket, this little guy got in, ate our minnows, and sadly for him drowned in there....    Saturday's fishing was very good, the sun even came out, many fish in the slot and a nice limit of keepers          Time to get to work .....  and the reward.....   Blue skies on Sunday .....slow bite, one nice fish for the Habs fan......   Great trip boys !!!   Scenery.....  PS. one more picture of the pike (love my brothers face on this one     "
816365,Terry,2013-11-02 16:28:00,14456,looks like a great trip
816411,fishindevil,2013-11-02 21:14:00,6254,Awesome !!! Some real nice walleyes and a nice pike !!!! Looks like it was a great trip !!!! Tight-lines & cheers
816412,NAW,2013-11-02 21:18:00,4022,Great report man!  Love the rainbow shot!  A Pot of g-bay gold!
816413,kickingfrog,2013-11-02 21:19:00,8333,Great to have annual trips like that. I didn't know they still made Old Vienna. Used to see a lot of that at the neighbours cottage back in the late 70's early 80's.
816421,davey buoy,2013-11-02 21:40:00,5505,"Going to plan a weekend in that area next summer,Great variety of fish and the scenic waterways,Looks like a great time!!!!!.I'm sold lol."
816427,Joey,2013-11-02 22:07:00,9122,Looks like a nice trip and all had fun!!  Too bad about the mink
816430,irishfield,2013-11-02 22:11:00,26272,I almost stopped viewing when I saw the OV.. but was looking hard for a case of Red Cap under the table...  GREAT late season trip !!!
816446,big guy,2013-11-02 23:05:00,414,"Ahhh nice, a fellow OV drinker, there are few of us, but we are kings indeed.  Was up there many moons ago, camped in the inlet, know exactly where you're fishing there, boats always congregated there in the low light hours. Beautiful area.  If you don't mind, can you speak to the accommodations you had, always looking for a new place to go. Which cabin did you stay in? What's the place like? How far from the lodge to the river? Appreciate it."
816483,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-03 01:37:00,4399,Nice outing and report and I can tell your brother is a class act!!!!
816487,captpierre,2013-11-03 02:08:00,2521,nice to see a healthy walleye population up there
816489,Skud,2013-11-03 02:24:00,739,Well done!
816491,Rod Caster,2013-11-03 02:32:00,5784,An opportunistic yet unlucky Mink!  Great report. I also really like that rainbow pic.
816493,mike rousseau,2013-11-03 02:50:00,4661,Great report...  Those mink sure can catch minnows / fish...  We have a tank for minnows... Sometimes we put our fish in there at night to clean in the morning... One night the minks (saw the footprints) wrestled out 3 walleye from 3-5 pounds...
816524,Fish Farmer,2013-11-03 12:25:00,2234,"Great report thanks for sharing. Nothing better than getting away with your buddy's and brother. I've always wanted to try out  Baril, I used to fish the Key R."
816538,Tim Mills,2013-11-03 13:55:00,476,Looks like a lot of fun and some good fishing. .  Good product placement in shot 1 also.
816541,stasbrute,2013-11-03 14:31:00,206,"Gee looks like the OV shot was as popular as the fishing shots, he he he. I remember when you would get a free fishing lure with a case of OV....Thanks for the replies, glad you enjoyed them. We stayed at Kenlea Cottages, Big Guy, the cabins are nice for the fisherman/woman, and not a far (about 5 miles) to ""the river""."
816542,stasbrute,2013-11-03 14:37:00,206,"I think the slot, and low keep limit is helping the walleye population up there, plus enforcement, we see the CO pretty much every time we are there."
816545,Terry,2013-11-03 14:52:00,14456,OV sponsored the bass tourneys in ontario in the late 80s

Appreciate it. http://www.kenleacottages.com/index.html  We stayed there for years, mom and dad were a lot more practical than wives were! LOL It has been a long time for me though. It was never a fancy place, but comfortable for the intended purpose.  Always under powered in boats but depending on yours it isn't a long run from the camp to the river, maybe 2 miles? I did it for years in a 14 foot aluminum boat with a 5hp sabre on the back, and you could pass by a lot of good spots on the way to the river."
816547,bigcreekdad,2013-11-03 15:10:00,546,can I go next year?
816552,davey buoy,2013-11-03 15:43:00,5505,How is that area for rocks hitting your boat.?lol.I'm thinking being part of G-Bay the water would be very low.
816555,tdotfisherman,2013-11-03 15:51:00,317,"Great photos, thanks for posting.  I was up there for our annual fishing trip 2 weeks ago, we didn't have the numbers we usually do but lots of size.  Amazing fishery for sure..."
816708,Headhunter,2013-11-04 14:57:00,5703,"Thanks for posting the report... OV was the beer I would take to parties in my youth. If I saw another person drinkin OV, I knew where they got it! LOL Thanks for the pics! HH"
816721,kickingfrog,2013-11-04 15:39:00,8333,My dad would say that he would ask for it at a bar because it was almost always the coldest.
