816308,Rich,2013-11-02 12:20:00,3927,"Just two weeks later, like a weird dream.. I walked down the river to where a salmon managed to drag me down a hill and into the creek last week, lol.. and there is a big dark fish sitting in the same spot. At first I thought it was the same salmon from last week. He was darting from side to side at the back of the pool agressively feeding on chub minnows. I bombed my #5 Blue Fox at him once, twice, and the third time my reel backlashed a little. Spinner dropped to bottom, and he came from 4 feet back and CRUSHED it, right on bottom! Fish on, whoa, this is no half dead boot. In the jam at the back of the pool for a good while but eventually he came out and laid in the net for me. My new PB brown.  "
816316,kickingfrog,2013-11-02 12:36:00,8333,"Nice.  My son is sitting beside me. When told that it was a brown trout he says: ""It's not brown. It's the colour of a pickle. It should be called a pickle trout.""  What can you do?"
816323,Joeytier,2013-11-02 13:03:00,3990,What a big ugly brute!  Awesome story and great fish man!
816329,BillM,2013-11-02 13:35:00,17367,Sweet brown Rich!  I love those giant kypes!
816331,Locnar,2013-11-02 13:51:00,645,Impressive man!  I gotta try me hands at the grand sometime.

816419,Skud,2013-11-02 21:30:00,739,"Nice catch, and you learned a new pattern for catching them too. Who would have thought a Mepps laying on the bottom of the river would bring in the big one."
816440,ChasinTails,2013-11-02 22:45:00,90,nice pickle trout
816456,Ron,2013-11-02 23:32:00,1683,Atta boy Rich!  So much for the WGSF now.....

816526,Rod Caster,2013-11-03 12:33:00,5784,One heck of a pickle trout.   As if it hit hardware on bottom like that
816528,Rich,2013-11-03 12:36:00,3927,"Thanks everybody! I was much more excited in person than this post made it sound, lol  And yeah, odd thing is it's not the first time it's happened to me. It's becoming a running joke now if I get backlash and my spinner sinks to set the hook cuz there's a fish on. Hahaha"
816563,Steve,2013-11-03 17:15:00,2075,"one of the largest browns i'm aware of, caught by board member Miller, was caught after he let his spoon fall to bottom.  a 20lbs brown slurped up the chunk of steel off bottom."
