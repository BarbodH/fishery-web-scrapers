Few bucks for gas...  And a positive attitude towards fishing on a cold windy rainy day... With a fall walleye lunatic... Lol  I'm driving up from Cornwall so I can meet someone anywhere between Cornwall and Kingston along the 401...

816091,Ron,2013-11-01 06:51:00,1683,"Mike I would be all over this if I didn't have plans with the wife.  Easy way to fix that Jose, cancel the plans with your wife.  Nice offer Mike, unfortunately I have plans for up north."
