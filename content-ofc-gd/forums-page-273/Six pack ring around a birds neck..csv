816618,hammercarp,2013-11-03 23:20:00,964,Six pack ring around an animals neck . I have seen pictures and posters and videos but today I witnessed it first hand. I know it's just one of those stinking cormorants but that is a gruesome and slow way to die. I would have no problem shooting these things or even knocking them on the head with a stick but this is something different.  Sorry for the crappy cell phone pictures.

Yep, I have rescued a seagull that had one stuck around his neck. I also take the scissors to 6 pack rings before throwing them out."

816695,Rich,2013-11-04 11:53:00,3927,Why even take the 6 pack rings fishing? Take the two seconds to seperate your cans. They are likely in a cooler bag anyway. Throw them in your blue box at home and for heavens sakes put the cans there too when you get back!
816707,Whitespinnerbait,2013-11-04 14:50:00,2038,Why are 6 pack rings tossed overboard to begin with !!!
