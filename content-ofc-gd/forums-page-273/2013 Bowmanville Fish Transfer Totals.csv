816005,John Bacon,2013-11-01 00:05:00,3277,"5 eh?  Money well spent. Lol.  In fairness, that is not one of the creeks that has been stocked with Atlantics."
816031,ChasinTails,2013-11-01 01:26:00,90,"duffins has 1 confirmed, i saw a dead one, and witnessed 3 caught so duffins is doing ok"

816068,kemper,2013-11-01 03:15:00,2232,At least 500 of those cohos are currently nose in to a bank covered in red sores and unable to swim.  Something bad is going on with the Cohos this year...

816174,Steve,2013-11-01 18:49:00,2075,I understand 9 tics were found at Streetsville and 7 at Duffins.
816229,fishindevil,2013-11-01 22:58:00,6254,"Just think if they scraped the Atlantic program and used that money to hire more conservation officers ??? Hmmmm ..... So a dozen or 2 atlantics ??? I guess they are probly worth $20,000 each for the money they have dumped into the program"
816240,John Bacon,2013-11-02 00:07:00,3277,A lot of the money for the atlantics is private money donated specifically for this program.  It isn't available for other uses.  If the atlantic program is scrapped then it is unlikely that this money will be donated for other fishing programs.
