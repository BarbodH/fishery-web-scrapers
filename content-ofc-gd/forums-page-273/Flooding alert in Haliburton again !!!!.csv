816093,fishindevil,2013-11-01 09:14:00,6254,Seen an MNR news release about the gull river and burnt river watersheds !!!! High wAter alert and flood watch !!! Again I hope we don't have a repeat if the spring .... I know my lake has risen at least 6 inches in the last week so they are letting the water go but can't get rid of it fast enough !!! I guess Haliburton places got 50mm of rain with more Comming !!!!!! It has rained so much even our well is full and the ground is saturated here in the kawarthas !!!!!! I'm gonna get some pics today hopefully from Haliburton .....
816095,Joeytier,2013-11-01 09:53:00,3990,Yeah flood advisories everywhere today!  Huge systems rolling thru everywhere with high water already pretty well everywhere!
816111,Nemo,2013-11-01 13:56:00,727,Was there any flooding?  Here is the link to the advisory.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@emergencymanagement/documents/document/stdprod_100815.pdf
816114,SmokestackLightnin,2013-11-01 14:19:00,390,Likely not the same as the spring.  The spring was compounded by the snow melt that happened when the rains came.
816139,captpierre,2013-11-01 16:18:00,2521,I like this website.  Gives water levels on the Trent and the various watersheds  http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/on/trentsevern/visit/ne-wl/trent_e.asp
816187,singingdog,2013-11-01 19:41:00,1047,"No flooding that I have seen. The Gull is running about 45 cms, less than 1/2 of what it did in the spring."
