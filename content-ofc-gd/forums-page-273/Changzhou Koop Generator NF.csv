He bought this thing in Mississauga about 5 or  6 years ago but the store he got it from no longer exists. I tried contacting the manufacturer to no avail. He kept asking what name brand it is. The only sticker on it says Koop. He tells me impossible we don't sell them under the name Koop, whats the name brand? After about 10 emails back and forth I gave up on him. All I want to know is where can I get parts. Unbelievable that the manufacturer cannot tell me where in Canada I can get parts and or service.  Ok I think I got it off my chest.  Anybody know of a dealer that services theses machines?   Thanks."
815696,Big Cliff,2013-10-30 09:54:00,6899,"No, and good luck finding the parts for it. I have a lot of guys that bring me generators that are ""made in China"" that they picked up ""really cheap"". and getting parts for them is almost impossible."

815707,Gerry,2013-10-30 11:23:00,257,"Is it yellow in colour? I think it's the brand that tried to imitate the Honda and Honda obtained a world wide court order for them to stop selling. In fact the order was so broad that it ordered all dealers to remove them from their inventory. Although they were Honda clones, the quality was poor. Your friend might now have another boat anchor."
815710,Steelheadphycho,2013-10-30 12:13:00,470,"Or try the Honda parts......... If its a clone of a Honda the parts may fit. Better than scrapping it. My bro-n-law had a 50cc 4wheeler that was a Honda clone and Honda parts worked on it.  If not, I'm sure that it could slow your drift.......  Good luck!"
815713,woodenboater,2013-10-30 12:33:00,2277,I wonder if this morphed into Kipor generators ?
815746,BillM,2013-10-30 15:43:00,17367,I wonder if this morphed into Kipor generators ?  This was going to be my guess as well.

816282,hawk-eye,2013-11-02 03:42:00,141,After some more research I believe it is an Apache generator. Any dealers around selling these? I fired off an email to Apache in Texas but no response.
