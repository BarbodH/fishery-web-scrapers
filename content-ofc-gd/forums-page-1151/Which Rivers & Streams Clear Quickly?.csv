However, the weather has begun to change.  Supposedly, that river gets cloudy quite quickly after a rain.  How long does it take for the water to clear-up?  Do any of the other rivers & streams in the area clear up any quicker?  Are there there any that stay reasonably clear & fishable despite a rain?  Thanks for your time & attention."

Decided to leave all the heavy gear at home.  Salmon can wait until next year.  ( Leaving more for you. )  Take care.  ""Sandy"""
