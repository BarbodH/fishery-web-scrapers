111159,Dano,2007-09-07 16:03:00,719,"Nicely done Emil. solopaddler, I too was struck by the different colours of the lakers from Temagami to Opeongo, quite a contrast. Emil, we gonna hook up for Simcoe this year?"

Those whities and lakers on Simcoe had a loooooooong vacation from me so by January it'll be time to say ""hi"" to them ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
