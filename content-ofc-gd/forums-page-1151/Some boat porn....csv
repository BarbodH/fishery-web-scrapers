Two sets of ""Grippers"" for bouys or fish baskets etc..    Cleats for the Anchor    The Substructure..   Washed out.. Just needed to grab the leaves..   Ahhhh the Floor... Dont know why it looks so warped in this shot...   Here the Floor has been installed. The dark marks around the screws is just saw dust.   Needed to work out a couple winkles in the deck after I installed it.. not a big issue just apply a bit of pressure   Cliff, gonna be comfortable enough for yah?  Now.. to plan the back floor...  Gerritt."

111602,Deano,2007-09-09 14:02:00,767,"Great job, looks great. Did my boat about 10 years ago now and still holding out. I coated all my plywood with a stain, (payed cheap for stain cause it was an ugly color, but it got covered with carpet, so didn't matter) That outdoor carpet I used is sure durable."
