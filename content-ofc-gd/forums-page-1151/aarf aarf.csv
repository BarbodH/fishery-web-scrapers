111889,brandon,2007-09-10 04:04:00,857,  Well I gave napping a shot earlier and I was unsuccessful and really didnt feel like watching TV all night so I decided to head down to the location where I shot the photos of Canada Place from.  I was hoping to see some seals because I heard some in the dark the one night I was there.  I got there a little later than I planned so the photos I took turned out quite bad including the one above but now I know where to go and i'll get them......just a matter of time.  Not to mention they wouldn't come in close enough for a decent picture.  With bears you can sort of stalk them for a good shot.....no way I'm goin for a swim for seal pictures.  One did surface about 15ft in front of me but by the time I got the camera on it all the picture shows is a swirl from where it went under......anyways keep an eye out for some more seal pics this week.....the hunt is on
