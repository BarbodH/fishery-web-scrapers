111452,chemongrick,2007-09-08 22:52:00,1,I have been on Chemong Lake for the past 10 years and know the fishing quite well in the area but  have an opportunity to buy a property in Woodville on Julian Lake.  Does anyone have any expert or first hand knowledge of the fishing in that particular lake other than it is land-locked and the size of a bath tub?
