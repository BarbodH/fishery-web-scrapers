The boy actually hooked into one of the bigger suckers but after a short fight he lost it.Here is a pic of him after losing it.Does he not look happy.lol  Sunday morning I thought I would brave the rain and go out on my own before anyone else woke up.Was not very pleasant fishing but I did end up with 10 or so in a couple of hours.All were about this size.  While down there I saw a guy I knew had shown up so went over and tried fishing for carp with him.He lost a huge one but did end up catching this guy.   After showing the boys the pics of the carp when I got home they wanted to go out of course.So, after supper off we went.   We got there and my friend came back too.In 3 hours I managed to lose 3 carp,the oldest boy lost one and we all agreed to try again tomorrow.Here are some pics of the evening..       After getting the area ready for tomorrow we called it a night.Was fun getting out with the kids and seeing them starting to get into bigger fish"

111941,fatherof3,2007-09-10 11:54:00,1769,thanks Rizzo.They want to go out every day(fine with me)and being a 5 minute walk to 2 rivers is just too tempting.I only had 6lb test on yesterday but upgrading today so hopefully have some carp pics tonight.Really hurt losing every fish I hooked.
111942,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 11:54:00,7971,Great report!  It's awesome to be able to share this addiction with your kids!  Looking forward to you next report.

111997,Marko,2007-09-10 16:07:00,854,Good luck tonight! You might wanna bait the area where you want to fish with corn or bread. When fishing for carp it helps. They are feisty and fight really hard.
111999,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-10 16:08:00,698,I really enjoy the reports from the Nith. Keep em coming. Just waiting for you to catch the biggie
