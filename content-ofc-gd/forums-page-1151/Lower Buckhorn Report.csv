I have been reading a lot of reports of low water levels the last while but no such problem on Lower Buckhorn as the levels were several inches above normal. As far as the fishing went I was targeting muskies and managed to catch one small one maybe 18"" long, does that even count? Anyway it was a nice couple days but got blown off the lake on Friday by strong winds. I do have a pic of the little muskie but am embarrassed to post it but if you really want to see it let me know and maybe I'll get up the courage to post it LOL!!!  Kawartha Kev"
111462,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-08 23:49:00,698,  As far as I'm concerned just catching a muskie is an accomplishment no matter what the size. Post the pic
111464,bassboy,2007-09-08 23:57:00,161, I agree!   Lets see it!!  Bill
111467,Rich,2007-09-09 00:00:00,3927,Little guys grow into big guys! Let's see the healthy little squirt!
111479,Kawartha Kev,2007-09-09 00:49:00,281,You guys are killing me!! At least there is no picture of me in the photo as I was fishing alone. The bucktail is almost half the size of the fish. Oh the shame!!!  Enjoy!!! LOL  Kawartha Kev  
111480,Kawartha Kev,2007-09-09 01:00:00,281,Here's a bit better picture having a little trouble with the sizing.  Kawartha Kev  
111481,Zib,2007-09-09 01:01:00,369,Yes those little guys count. Here's one that I caught that's even smaller.  
111483,Kawartha Kev,2007-09-09 01:07:00,281,That makes me feel better!!! Thats how I want my photo to appear how did you get it to that size Zib?  Kawartha Kev
111485,Zib,2007-09-09 01:11:00,369, I have no idea. It was taken on a higher quality setting & then when I uploaded it to Photobucket the size was adjusted automatically.
111492,Kawartha Kev,2007-09-09 01:34:00,281,Let's try it this way I think I have it now  
111542,bassboy,2007-09-09 04:25:00,161,Small or not....its a nice looking fish.  Great colour/markings!!    WTG!!   Bill
111547,jediangler,2007-09-09 04:49:00,1923,"They're so cute when they're small. I just want to pinch their little cheeks. Here's a baby from earlier this year in the kayak.  Be proud of them all, no matter the size."
111574,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-09 12:43:00,1183,    Small fish is all I know...dem big ones I am not ready for.
