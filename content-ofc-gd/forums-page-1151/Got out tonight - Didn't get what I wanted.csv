110682,ccmtcanada,2007-09-06 02:26:00,7971,"Well, Bly and I headed to a spot where we've heard some people were hooking some Salmon!  We've gone out for the past 3 nights, and while we've heard that there have been hookups, we haven't witnessed one, until tonight.  A guy was there with his son, and sure enough I hear the drag peeling TONS of line!  The fish went about 50 yards in about 1 second....leaving a HUGE wake across the surface of the water.  I dont know how you are supposed to bring one of those in unless you have a HUGE reel with about 500 yards of line on it and then HOPE it doesn't hit any structure...which by the way is EVERYWHERE....LOL.  Anyhow, after casting spoon after spoon....crankbait after crankbait....massaging my poor shoulder every night, I decided to put a lindy rig on, and put a good ole fashioned worm on it.  I then sat down and relaxed.  Suddenly, I get a strong hit...I begin to reel it in and my first thought was ""I wonder what this is...it cant be a bullhead...they dont actually fight"".  I knew it was a small fish, but the thing actually jumped out of the water...LOL.  Anyhow, didn't measure or weigh it but here it is...my PB Bullhead...LOL.  I look absolutely thrilled dont I??? haha.    Thanks for reading this...hope you were not too bored....haha."
110685,tbayboy,2007-09-06 02:32:00,1497,Well if you squint really hard and look from a funny angle it kinda looks like a salmon  - ahh who am I kidding but nice bullhead all the same
110686,fatherof3,2007-09-06 02:34:00,1769,not what you wanted but better than a skunk
110693,007,2007-09-06 02:42:00,537,Is this the return of Cliff's nightly reports where he catches a different species each night? I hope so....  Nice Bullhead - what's tomorrow's catch??
110697,PERCHER,2007-09-06 02:46:00,787,Not a bad Bullhead at all.Way to go!
110716,Greencoachdog,2007-09-06 03:24:00,8163,You have now been inducted to the Catfish Hall of Shame!  ... Hey Art!... we got another Sucker!!!  That is a darn fine specimen!
110728,motv8tr,2007-09-06 06:21:00,2587,Better than the fish I have caught lately  Maureen
110736,dsn,2007-09-06 07:57:00,1018,I'd go for bullheads any day when nothing else is around. They are fun. And easy on the back.  dsn
110751,bassmastermike,2007-09-06 09:52:00,295,WTG Cliff  Man i wish i could get out as much as you LOL
110759,scuro,2007-09-06 10:39:00,386,I wasn't bored at all!!!! So are they casting large spoons close to shore for the salmon?
110768,ccmtcanada,2007-09-06 11:33:00,7971, LOL Sean...thanks for trying to make me feel better...haha.  Dont little bullheads grow up to be salmon?  Thought I read that somewhere...
110772,ccmtcanada,2007-09-06 11:44:00,7971," This was the first hook up I've seen.  Of all the people I've talked to, no one has seen one actually landed yet.  I think they are now staging...waiting for cool weather and RAIN!  Man...do we ever need rain...and lots of it...not just for fishing, but for my poor lawn...LOL"
110773,BITEME,2007-09-06 11:44:00,1969,Hey Cliff 9 foot rod 10lb trilene big fish no problem you will get them set your drag once and dont touch it again test the drag by pulling the line at the end of the rod not at the real make the rod bend  your gonna love this sheet
110775,mcallister.grant,2007-09-06 11:48:00,327,"At least there was a ""hookup"". I think you may be right ""Bullheads do grow up to be salmon and sometimes trout!"""
110781,solopaddler,2007-09-06 12:08:00,8605," Nice report Cliff! As far as needing rain, well if you're into catching salmon off the piers and breakwalls this fall is shaping up to be a banner year as less rain is better. With no water in the creeks the fish will stack up like crazy in the estuaries. The only real factor for success is water temps and they'll inevitably start to drop within a week or so.... I'll start worrying about the lack of rain when October rolls around and it's time to start catching steelhead  ."
110789,mattyk,2007-09-06 12:32:00,2110,atleast you caught a fish. Better than being at home and doing chores!
110797,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-06 12:45:00,698,Bullheads taste great. Too bad they usually come from nasty waters.
110831,The Urban Fisherman,2007-09-06 15:08:00,2050,"Hey Cliff,  I was @ the credit last weekend - didn't hook into anything myself but a few other people did.  They were most active between midnight and 4 a.m.  I got there @ 4 and watched a few people leaving with salmon in their nets.  And a couple others hooked into them between 4 and 9 a.m.  You'll get'em!  Good Luck dude!  Cheers, UF"
110854,Terry,2007-09-06 17:03:00,14456,"hey you are getting out fishing, that's all that counts, getting fish is a bonus  and with photoshop  and that bad boy can be any monster fish you like  theres the big one...lol sorry too much time on my hands  "

110874,ccmtcanada,2007-09-06 19:00:00,7971," It has been tough..but after what I saw last night with the Salmon, I'm putting the 6 foot 6"" rod away...my 9 foot surf rod is coming out to battle those scrappy guys!"
111353,Crazyhook,2007-09-08 04:59:00,1154,you fishing with Steve Hamilton?
