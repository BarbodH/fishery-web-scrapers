I was on the other side of the river from the bird and it was way up in a tree, so my pictures really aren't very good since the camera is at max zoom and I couldn't get any closer.  I was kind of thinking there's a slight chance its a peregrine falcon.  I know there are a few birds that nest in downtown London which is a few blocks from this location.  The bird took off 15 or so minutes later and was gliding like a hawk but was covering a fairly large area instead of the circle-style flying hawks tend to do.  Perhaps its just a hawk or even an owl?  If anyone can tell me what it might be that would be great.  Sorry for the lack of detailed pics.    I have more pics but they are basically all the exact same.  I was just trying to get the most detailed pic I could from a far distance.  I'm horrible at photo editing, so you may need to zoom in on the pics yourself to get a better look.  Thanks.        "
111696,ChrisK,2007-09-09 19:42:00,2772,That would be an Osprey. Ive been seeing an Osprey the past few fishing trips on the Thames in Dorchester area. First time I saw him he was diving down into the rapids and taking small fish. Quite a sight to see this going on just 50 yards away...  CHEERS !!

111724,Beats,2007-09-09 21:06:00,543,thx for identifying the bird for me.  I had no idea what it was.
