Watched it eat a few mosquito larvae in the meantime (really cool) Ended up talking to a friend who is in charge of the Invading Species Hotline. She was able to identify it for me and said it was very rare but not unheard of in Ontario, just a handfull of reported sightings, and a native species to boot! Kinda neat to capture a very rare thing! I'll try and post a pic of it when I get some free time. My brother sent me this wikapedia entry he found on it.   jjcanoe"

111554,singingdog,2007-09-09 11:01:00,1047,About 3 weeks ago I was on Grass Lake in Haliburton. The water was virtually filled with those. I guessed at the time that a 5 gallon bucket of that lake water would have had 50 small jellyfish in it and the entire water column - I could see down about 8 feet - looked to be that dense. First time in 20 years up here that I have seen them.

111619,ecxstriper,2007-09-09 14:53:00,343,"What I love is that in here New Jersey you have to be careful when remove sea weeds for your line/hooks the jelly fish will be on there too and you can't see them .  I've swam through a school of them while surfing and it does hurt , but I've never seen fresh water jellies. COOL"

111798,Rizzo,2007-09-10 00:45:00,4754," That is the last line of the link that was posted.  If seeing one is good luck, just imagine what owning one as a pet might be good for!  go buy some lottery tickets and share the winnings with your friends at OFC (or at least me since I recommended it  :thumbsup_anim:)"
