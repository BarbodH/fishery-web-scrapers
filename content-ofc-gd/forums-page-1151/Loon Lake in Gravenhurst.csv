I can't seem to find too much information on it through google other than cottage rental stuff.  Anybody fish it before ? My buddy says there is Bass and Pike but just wondering if anybody had any first hand experience and what type of tackle to bring.  Not looking for honey holes just an idea of what the lake is like.  Thanks, Jim"
