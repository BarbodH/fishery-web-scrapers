112065,xrap,2007-09-10 18:26:00,683,Don't know what a trophy coho would be but any coho for me would be a trophy
112066,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 18:31:00,7971,"I'm not an expert, but the minimum length for one to qualify for an Ontario Angler Award (OFAH Program) is 30"".  I'd say anything over that is a very respectable fish.  The biggest this year in that program is 36"" (24 pounds).  Last year, the biggest was 36.75"" and 21 pounds....and for 2005 it was 36"" and 18 pounds.  The Canadian record great lakes Coho by weight looks to be 26.64 pounds... http://www.canadian-sportfishing.com/Natio...h_And_Keep1.asp"
112078,Headhunter,2007-09-10 18:49:00,5703,"Thanks for that Cliff! Guess my ""little"" 12 lber I caught last weekend wasn't that big after all! HH"
112080,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 18:51:00,7971, 12 pounds of any single fish to me is still a BIG fish!!! LOL.
112082,xrap,2007-09-10 18:52:00,683,"  Congrats, would love to catch one of those!!!!!!"
112126,SlowPoke,2007-09-10 20:01:00,2984," Funny you should post that link Cliff. When I got home Saturday I checked it to see if my Rainbow was even close... Looking down the chart... ahhh Coho, hmmm, Claudes was about 30"" might as well check that... scan across the coho line....26!!!!! Oh wait, that's pounds LOL. Nevermind.  Needless to say my PB Rainbow wasn't even close... 36lb record if I recall. -Brian"
112130,Aaron Shirley,2007-09-10 20:07:00,655,"IMHO Any coho 12-pounds or more is a good fish, and over 15 is a great fish.  I have been getting into some good fish out of Bronte this year.  Its' very nice to see  Aaron  Here is a coho on the larger size that I have been getting out of Bronte this year. "
112133,Headhunter,2007-09-10 20:15:00,5703,"Man, that is a sweet coho! Congrats! HH"
112135,Canuck2fan,2007-09-10 20:16:00,1444,I caught two cohos last year both were under 10lbs but that was on Lake Huron. The funny part was the bigger fish about 7lbs I got in the winter during a 2 week thaw about as far up as you legally fish on that river river the first week of March. An older guy that was there was freaking out because he said he hadn't seen a coho that big in the spring in years.... He about spit out his teeth when I said that was a fun fight thanks for helping with the net and I let the fish go..... (Something that would never had happened if it had of been under 4 lbs my favorite size for eating)  So to me a 12lber is a darn fine fish!!!!
