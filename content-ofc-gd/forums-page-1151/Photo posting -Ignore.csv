On the old board I would upload the photo, right click on the photo in the gallery to get ""location"" then copy that location inbetween the  thingees.  I've already uploaded into my gallery, but can't seem to get a proper location when I click on properties.  Sorry to be a trouble, but I can't seem to find in the ""help"" section where it describes how to post a photo, and when  I do a forum search on ""image posting"" I'm not having any luck either (even though I'm sure this topic has been done to death).  Please assist a computer ignoramus in AS SIMPLE A LANGUAGE AS POSSIBLEZ"
