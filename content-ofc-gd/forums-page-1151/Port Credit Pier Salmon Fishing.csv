111131,mikeymikey,2007-09-07 14:58:00,376,"Not too much to say other than that I went to fish at the Mouth of Credit River and result was excellent!  It was early in the morning still dark.  I just gave a quick zap with my head led light to my cleo.  Made my first cast and BooM!!   First cast, First salmon of 2007.  It sure felt good again to hear the drag scream and watch fishing jumping around.  So here it is...   - Boeing 777  "
111134,mikeymikey,2007-09-07 15:02:00,376,"Now the sad part.  I failed to revive the fish and it wasn't able to swim away.  It did gave a few kicks so I let it go and within close reach it floated back up.  My question is, if I did not let it go and fish was not able to revive again... what would be a proper thing to do with this fish?"
111137,aniceguy,2007-09-07 15:06:00,1094,its illegal to allow a fish suitable for consumption to spoil......some would argue that these fish are not suitable for consumption ( I agree) but not in the OMNR's eyes.....a CO could lay a charge on it
111140,tonyb,2007-09-07 15:21:00,1637,"Not necessarily Louis, check the consumption guidelines for Chinook salmon. No fish over 26"" is to be consumed.  That fish is certainly over 26"".  I'll agree though, it is a grey area and an ethics question.  Do you keep fishing for fish that you tire to death???  If the fish was that exhausted, you may want to consider beefing up your equipment to be able to land the fish quicker.  Also, warm water temperatures may have played a role as well.  Tony"
111142,frozen-fire,2007-09-07 15:26:00,542,good work mikeymikey!
111146,Photoz,2007-09-07 15:28:00,792,Surely there was SOMEBODY around that would have been happy to take it off your hands? Better to see it on somebody's table than stinking up the shoreline?
111164,Pigeontroller,2007-09-07 16:25:00,2793,"That Chinook was near the end of its life anyway...It was a stocked fish and not likely to successfully reproduce naturally. Don't lose any sleep over it. Next time keep it for the garden, your plants will love it!"
111396,Douger,2007-09-08 14:42:00,116,nice one.  congrats.  still waiting for mine...
111409,mikeymikey,2007-09-08 16:33:00,376,"  I gears are 10'0"" Medium + PowerPro 30lb and I don't worry about line breaking so I pull in the fish fast & hard other than when it goes for a run.  Should I be considering a Medium-Heavy rod ?   Any good alternative rod which is atleast 9+foot long?  From what I have seen most of people at pier don't use beefy enough rods.  Than again I haven't seen any of them caught one to see how they fight the fish."
111417,.goneFishing.,2007-09-08 17:15:00,10,You dont need a beefy rod to catch a salmon. Ive seen local catch a salmon with a 6 feet rood and 12 lb line. I personally use 50lb spiderwire and a 10 feet medium action rod.
111421,Nater,2007-09-08 19:05:00,68,who cares if it died...Water is warm and fish is near the end of it's life anyways.  One less fish to rott on the side of the river.  No sense loosing sleep over a dead salmon  Nate
111422,Gerritt,2007-09-08 19:31:00,6129,"  as a person that thinks conservation is important, and the fact that I value life (No I am not a tree hugger) I find your comment the exact opposite of what most fishermen on this board would think..  It is unfortunate that the fish died and was not consumed... it happens and is part of fishing..  but to be so callous saying "" who cares if it died "" is just wrong in my opinion.  Gerritt."
111424,Rombo,2007-09-08 19:57:00,39,"first off new to the board just wanted say HI. I usually fish bass and never fished salmon before. A buddy and I are thinking of going out tomorrow.  Was just wondering how far north (upstream) we can go on our major rivers like humber, credit, bronte and still except to get some action?"
111436,HIMTI,2007-09-08 21:38:00,33,Mikey...whats with the red shoes?????
111440,Milty,2007-09-08 21:54:00,121,"  I use a 10'6"" medium Heavy Quantum IM8 Stealheader, 12-25lb test when the salmon are near the mouth of lake O tribs and it works great,..I run 15-17lb maxima Ultra green main and a 12lb flouro leader and It turns those nookies,....up river its back to the 12'6"" ultra-lite 4-8lb"
111441,urbanangler1990,2007-09-08 21:59:00,933, agreed
111494,mikeymikey,2007-09-09 01:37:00,376, What's wrong with red?  I've got yellow & blue too.  White or Black just ain't colorful.   ----- Oh and I don't think I am not going to replace my rod just to hope that I can revive very few unlucky fish.
111512,FishFinder,2007-09-09 02:10:00,481,"Next time you can leave it in front of the fish cleaning station at PC, thats where the charter boats leave their unwanted fish, most end up getting taken by someone."
111515,mikeymikey,2007-09-09 02:13:00,376, Thanks for the tip. But I am not sure exactly where that is.
111592,Milty,2007-09-09 13:36:00,121,"  100 m south of the lighthouse, right accross the river from Snug Harbor, right by the boat launch, cant miss it."
