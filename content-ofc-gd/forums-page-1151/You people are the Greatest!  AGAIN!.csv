111189,Aaron Shirley,2007-09-07 17:16:00,655,"Hi Mike,  I sent Rob all the pictures, but I am not sure if he received all of them because I am still having issues sending attachments and uploading after reformatting my computer recently.  Dang computers!  Sorry it has taken so long to post the pics.  As for having kids of my own... hoping to start next year.  I already warned Kristi I cannot fish any less than I do, and she will have to do most of the work.  She said she is ok with that     I give it a few weeks with a crying baby before she changes her mind lol.  I sure hope they like fishing, because they will know how to tie a roe sack by the time they are five lol  I'll see what I can do to post the pics tonight when I get home.  Cheers,  Aaron"
