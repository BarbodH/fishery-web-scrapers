I've been looking for some sort of map to help me out, but can't find any..  I remember a site that had a general map of the harbour but can't remember it's name...  Any help would be greatly appreciated..  Tiz"

112121,Cast-Away,2007-09-10 19:47:00,790,"To launch at the park you have to book a campsite, otherwise you can launch at the Moon River Marina. I think that they charge $20 now."
