I am a little torn on this, I have been useing a medium to light action 6.6 and it is a little to flimsy for me when I am in the current. On the other hand when I am using the straight Medium action, it kind of seems a little stiff.  Any thoughts or recommendations would be appreciated.  Thanks!  Grant"
111372,Greencoachdog,2007-09-08 12:25:00,8163,I'd rather have a stiff sensitive rod over a floppy flimsy one any day!
111384,Muskieman,2007-09-08 13:18:00,2472,"EH!   I'm a avid walleye angler myself,, I also fish current ,, here's my setup, 7'berkely Lightenin' rod, med action, I've been using the same rod for Walleye now for 15 yrs and I love it, when I'm fishin' a lake I use a 15 yr old Bionix Pulse6'6""' med/lt... I like the med action in the current especially if yer using heavier jigs.. That's my opinion and I'm stickin' with it..  ZZZZZZZZZZING!..............SNAP!!"
111473,canadianguy33,2007-09-09 00:16:00,121,"Even though I know that med action rods make things easier, and are technically better, I still fish with an ultra light weight rig even when I'm fishing for pike.  I don't know why, somethings I just like doing the hard way I guess.  If you don't mind losing a bunch of fish then follow my lead."
111474,Rich,2007-09-09 00:20:00,3927,I just bought a 7 foot BPS Tourney Special medium action. I wasn't used to the stiffness (add crude joke here) but after using it for a day jigging for smallies I dont think I could go back to the old lighter version.
111476,Bob Devine,2007-09-09 00:37:00,251,"Grant, that is one of the toughest rod choices to make. I have used many rods on the Detroit River, the Kawartha's and many lakes in Michigan. Personal choice is the only call I can recommend. I use Shimano 6 or 6' 6"" med action, either Compre of Crucial. They have both worked well in many situations for myself and clients. If you know people that have a rod that you may like you could ask to try it while fishing with them. With the type of fishing that you are doing it is a feel bite and do not be afraid to pay a bit more. Trolling rods will stay in a rod holder, but when it is in your hand all day you want it to be light, sensitive and have enough backbone to set the hook on a bony mouthed walleye.  Enjoy you shopping. "
111482,Clampet,2007-09-09 01:06:00,1947,I really like my 6.5 Ft Fenwick Walleye Special for jigging and some slip float use! I use a 7' Shimano Aero Medium Action fer heavier applications like trollin'.
111484,Zib,2007-09-09 01:07:00,369,"I use both 6'6"" med & med light action rods while jigging for walleye in the Detroit River (about 7 mph current) & I don't have a problem with any of them. Are the rods that you are using one piece or 2 piece? I find 2 piece rods too flimsy so I stick to the 1 piece rods."
111539,wallyboss,2007-09-09 03:52:00,1095,"I use a  St.Croix 7' medium Fast action if I am fishing bottom bouncers, but I use a Compre 6' Medium Fast Action for any jigging i do."
111569,Bly,2007-09-09 12:32:00,1556,"Hello Grant...  Haven't used that many different brands of rods but of the ones I have tried while walleye fishing, my favorite was my fenwick 7ft medium (HMXS 70L) one piece.  I would concur with the members that have recommended a one piece, 2 pieces just do not have the same backbone."
