111516,Gerritt,2007-09-09 02:17:00,6129,"Cliff that was awesome brother!! thanks for sharing!  I took this from the news article..  "" Ochi Yosuke received the highest score from a panel of judges in the final late Friday at the Teatria rock club in Oulu, near the Arctic Circle. Apart from the glory, he received a custom-made Flying Finn electric guitar worth $3,400.""  Air Guitar pays.. LOL  Gerritt."
111517,brandon,2007-09-09 02:17:00,857,amazing man.......love those harmonics
111530,Sinker,2007-09-09 03:03:00,8692,Cliff.....that was freakin awesome man!!!
111540,bassboy,2007-09-09 03:59:00,161,Yeah....what Brandon said  Always love hearing harmonics........first time I ever heard them was by Alex Lifeson as a teenager and HAD to learn how to do that Never got as good (or anywhere near for that matter) as you.....and did not keep up with it.  Excellent Cliff!!   Bill
111575,ccmtcanada,2007-09-09 12:45:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!!  That song took me a  year to learn....  bassboy - I hear what you said about Lifeson...I grew listening to Rush and when I first heard Red Barchetta, I wanted to learn harmonics as well!  The thing about this song, it's the picking hand that's harder than the harmonics themselves."
111576,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-09 12:47:00,1183,You would have gotten my vote Cliff - I pick you over that air guitar guy anyday.  Give us more!!

111610,Deano,2007-09-09 14:21:00,767,"That's pretty awesome, That's one thing that I could never do, heck I still have problems doing the rubbing of the head and tummy at the same time. LOL"
111618,ecxstriper,2007-09-09 14:43:00,343, Bly and I are the air guitrist in the family we leave the real playing to Cliff
111653,ketchenany,2007-09-09 16:26:00,3229,"Clif,f  amazing. You don't need bait when you go fishing; just sit on shore play them a few tunes and they'll follow you home . . .   :clapping:  :clapping:"
111718,DT10Sam,2007-09-09 20:49:00,480,"HI Cliff,  I have had a very busy day here at the store and very hectic 6 hours that we were open. I just sat down to take a break and decided to see what OFNer's are up to today. Well I would like to say that you hearing you playing the guitar was a very refreshing number that I much needed.  You have a great talent Cliff and I thoroughly enjoyed your music.  Regards, Sam"
111879,Joey,2007-09-10 03:20:00,9122,"Just beautiful Cliff, very nice.  Joey"
111927,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 11:31:00,7971,Thank you everyone...it took me a full YEAR to learn that song.  I'd learn to play a little of it...then practise it until I was happy with it...then learn the next little bit....and so on.  Glad you enjoyed it!
