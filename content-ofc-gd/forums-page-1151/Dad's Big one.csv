110642,Pete Maina,2007-09-05 23:32:00,213,"Hi All,  Hey, many thanks for the kind words. I'll have to forward the link to my mon ... who can then show to dad (Tex avoids all things computer ... I don't know whether to call him dad, or lucky   ). I'm sure he'll appreciate the thoughts.  As far as the rods, I'm really not sure why they would be one backorder, but I do know there has been some issues on that in some stores ... they are selling well as more folks hear about them and try them. I will ask at corporate. Tacklebuster: the longer rods work pretty well for both casting and trolling. We often use them for inline board rods too, but mainly as casting rods. They do make the boatside stuff more effective as wider circles and eights can be done.  (Hope that hat kicks in for you Art!)  Assume you mean Lake St. Claire? No, fish caught on a lake in Ontario called Longlegged. Dad and I have an all-species trip there every year. It's a real good walleye and lake trout fishery, with some darn nice muskies too. We'd never gotten any real big ones to actually bite in the past ... finally did.  Pete"

110654,Crazyhook,2007-09-06 00:33:00,1154,"Roy is your father??  Just kidding! awesome fish, congrats to pop Pete!"
110656,Joey,2007-09-06 00:41:00,9122,"Congrats to your dad Pete, that's a sweet fish.  Joey"
110666,Pete Maina,2007-09-06 01:15:00,213,"Hi,  To explain a little something here: yes, Roy is my (French-speaking) father.  Thanks a ton Joey!  Pete"
110668,Pigeontroller,2007-09-06 01:25:00,2793,Nice fish! You're lucky to be fishin' with your Dad!
110674,fishindevil,2007-09-06 01:58:00,6254,"NICE CATCH !!!!!!   congrats to your dad pete,on his PB,50inch muskie...cheers"
110713,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-06 03:12:00,957,"Pete, I just visited BPS in Cincinnati and they had plenty of your rods on the rack and I'm sure there were many more in the back.   I always buy mail order because clumsy customers don't get a shot at them like they do in stores.  Longer rods are great.  You are putting together a great combo.  A good fishing tool."
110731,motv8tr,2007-09-06 06:38:00,2587,Very nice!  Congrats to your Dad on that one!  Maureen
110738,OhioFisherman,2007-09-06 08:08:00,6623,"Congrats Mr. Maina! very nice fish! LOL Pete, if you didn`t catch it you did a great job as a guide?"
110746,Rich Clemens,2007-09-06 08:53:00,3131,"Good to see a couple 50+ in recent days here.  My hat's off to your dad and congrats.   Someday, I'll join the 50 club.  Great to see others making it."
110755,Marc Thorpe,2007-09-06 10:31:00,621,"Nice beast due,congrats to you and Dad Boy Roy sure has some tall  kids"
110812,bigbuck,2007-09-06 13:39:00,2449,Nice Pete!! It's great that you get out on a fishing trip each year with your dad. I'm still trying to get mine to come out on a day trip.
110833,cisco,2007-09-06 15:17:00,597,"Fantastic accomplishment!  Congrats to you both on nailing a +54 casting!  Especially nice to see father and son gettin' er done!  I didn't know you had a 9fter available. I better check that out on the BPS website. I stuck a twilly tip onto the end of my PM 8'6"" extra heavy telescoping rod and she's reely sweet for wire line on big chinooks on Lake Ontario.  Take care and all the best to you and your dad.... and to cover all the possible bases...and to Roy too what the heck!!"
110844,Pete Maina,2007-09-06 16:17:00,213,"THanks again,  Yeah, trips with dad's are good (Hey Roy, dad ... are you taking me anywhere soon?). Lots of fun always ... of course a biggie at boatside was an added bonus for this trip.  Gotta get dad out there bigbuck. I do quite a few hunting and fishing trips with dad every year. Good times and laughs  (Cisco: 9 footer available starting last year. Good to hear the rod works well with wire.)  Pete"
110889,Aaron Shirley,2007-09-06 20:16:00,655,"Very nice musky your dad got Pete, WTG!  It's always nice to have a family member out and get a big 'lunge  Aaron"

110929,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-09-06 23:18:00,0," Yes I lost my dad 21.5 years ago.  Nothing beats getting a big one and sharing it with family.  Beautifull fish as well, doesn't look like there is a mark on her.  Congrats,"
110930,mistyjr1,2007-09-06 23:19:00,97,"Beauty Fish your Dad caught Pete!  A famous quote your dad may have said... ""Nice little fish, boy, I'll tell you what that was fun.""  Corey"

111161,Dano,2007-09-07 16:11:00,719, Yea me too.... I was thinking that old codger sure got around in his day!!!  Congrats to your dad Pete!
111506,kennyman,2007-09-09 01:56:00,737,WOW!! Just checked out where Longlegged Lake is. She's way up there north of Kenora. That's quite a hike. Looks like it was worth it though  .
110451,Pete Maina,2007-09-05 14:02:00,213,"Hi,  Just a quick story here. I get a few chances to get my dad out to do some muskie fishing every year. We always have a great time, and generally fish for a variety of species on trips. While we have fun either way, a little goal of mine has always been to see my dad get a fish over 50 inches. Been close, as a couple 49 inchers.  So, on the last day of a recent trip, my dad kinda jumped right over the line in a big way. Was neat to see  We'd raised the big fish a few times, but pretty lazy. A weather-window got the fish moving a bit ... dad practiced with a fish about 20 pounds at boatside. And we worked our way to the bigger one. (Of course this kind of thing rarely seems to actually work, but this time it did.) We could tell by the attitude as the fish started chasing the bucktail. Dad sped up as he neared the boat and so did the fish. Third turn on the figure 8 it ate the thing and then jumped. Pretty neat deal ... laughed later cuz dad said after hooking the fish ""think you should get the net for this one""  With Roy's help here, hope to have a pic up    Hope summer has treated you all well!  Pete"
110454,lew,2007-09-05 14:07:00,12767,Congrats to your Dad on his 1st ever 50 incher Pete  That's always a great milestone to accomplish !!
110455,wuchikubo,2007-09-05 14:10:00,1114,"Pete,  great to hear that you and your dad had a fun day out on the water.  Looking forward to seeing the pics.  Stan"

110475,ccmtcanada,2007-09-05 14:49:00,7971,"Wow!! Great story and great fish!  When I first saw the pic (thumbnail), I thought that was Roy holding that fish...LOL."
110476,fatherof3,2007-09-05 14:52:00,1769,"nice fish,congrats to your dad"
110478,TJQ,2007-09-05 14:54:00,7806,Very Nice!!!  Fishing like a ROCK STAR!!!
110482,mattyk,2007-09-05 15:00:00,2110,"very nice fish, great report Pete thanks for sharing it with us. It always great when you get a chance to fish with your father. Those are some of my best times out on the water."
110484,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-05 15:05:00,957,Congratulations Dad.  Really nice fish.  What rod and reel was he using?
110489,silveradosheriff,2007-09-05 15:12:00,1025,That's Awesome - Congrats!
110493,pigeonfisher,2007-09-05 15:31:00,696,Is Roy your dad?
110495,Terry,2007-09-05 15:48:00,14456,that's great.....  at first I was afraid it might have something to do with a kilt
110498,Moosebunk,2007-09-05 15:51:00,3970,Big congrats Pete and dad.  Beauty of a fish.
110503,Roy,2007-09-05 15:58:00,13728,"Heavy duty fish there Mr. Maina. Thanks for the report.  No, I'm not Pete's dad but I have been offered to play the part. BTW, Norwegians don't wear kilts.  Thanks again for posting, Pete."
110511,Pete Maina,2007-09-05 16:32:00,213,"HI,  Hey, thanks for all the neat responses here. (BTW, ruler was waving beyond 54 - so really was a nice one)  (Thanks for posting pic Roy, er, dad.)  What impresses me about the pic is the gill plate and dad's hands ... has big mitts.  Anyway, luck was shining on us and a neat experience.  Tennessee: was using my signature series stuff - with the 9 foot rod - comes in pretty handy at boatside.  (Was a bit too cold for a kilt Terry.)  Pete"
110515,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-05 16:59:00,957,"Yeah, I was pretty sure what combo pulled in that giant.  Got two, 8 1/2 footers myself and they sure do the job.  Last one missed my trip north by a month or so because of being backordered.  What's going on?  Not making them fast enough or too much demand?"
110531,dustink,2007-09-05 17:36:00,526,Congrats on a great lifetime fish!!
110542,Tacklebuster,2007-09-05 18:22:00,303,Great story and fish.  I didn't know that 8.5'-9' rods were used when trolling for musky.  How would a downrigger rod do?
110552,John,2007-09-05 18:46:00,2956,Great looking fish Dad...........congrat's......you too Pete!
110563,aplumma,2007-09-05 19:04:00,6896,Congradulations on the big fish dad you are now 54 inches ahead of my biggest musky. The magic hat Pete sent me just hasnt kicked in yet I sure hope all of the blue catfishin I have been doing hasn't ruined it.  Art
110566,fishnsled,2007-09-05 19:08:00,3520,NICE FISH!!!  Congrats to the 2 of you!
110586,kennyman,2007-09-05 20:10:00,737,Holy crap !!!!! Nice fish. Is that a LSC beauty?
110591,Rizzo,2007-09-05 20:25:00,4754,50 plus inch on a figure 8...better grab the heart medication.  My knees shake when a 40 incher is showing some interest!
110593,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-05 20:44:00,0,Congrats to the big guy! Thats a monster musky!
