112053,xrap,2007-09-10 18:18:00,683,Our Honda civics jsut went for a emission test and it had one thing failed. It says no ppm and I went to the driveclean.com website and searched ppm but I don't really understand  what it means. Can anyone explain it to me a little better?
112061,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 18:23:00,7971,"I thought ppm stood for ""parts per million"".  Each emission (eg Hydrocarbon, Nitric Oxide), has a threshold of how many ppm is acceptable.  If it's over that amount, that part of the test fails."

112069,Hooked,2007-09-10 18:33:00,891,"Remember, its important to drive your car for a good 20 minutes, preferably some type of hiway driving, before taking it to get tested.  Better chance of it passing then."
112072,xrap,2007-09-10 18:37:00,683,"Yep, your right hooked. I told my brother in law to do that but he didn't and jsut yesterday he poured a bottle of engine injector to clean it out a bit and the smoke from the exhaust was coming out white. Bad idea, and now he''ll be paying for it again."
