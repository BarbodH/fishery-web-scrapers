Up for grabs is a brand spanking new Shimano Sahara 2500FE spinning reel!  I'm running this on my Facebook page, so if you're on Facebook and we're not friends, send me a friend request.   It's simple, post one fishing related photograph and the photo with the most ""likes"" wins the reel. Contest starts right now and will run until Wednesday December 2 at 12pm.     https://www.facebook.com/mike.borger.71/posts/1055928767772291?comment_id=1055960974435737&notif_t=feed_comment    "
