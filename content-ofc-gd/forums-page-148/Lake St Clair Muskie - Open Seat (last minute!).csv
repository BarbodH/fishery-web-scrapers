946258,KraTToR,2015-11-24 22:54:00,506,"its a pricey day heading down alone...don't blame you for not going. I did it once alone, found it hard to justify the costs so always take a friend or two now Yes it certainly helps to have someone offset the costs.  Ive done solo day trips to LSC and to Wood's bay this year.. its enjoyable sometimes just to have alone time but it is spendy.  Plus its nice to have someone else on board to work the net, hold the camera, and blame for the big one you lost.."
945603,KraTToR,2015-11-20 18:42:00,506,"Leaving Kitchener at 4:30am on Saturday November 21st (yes tomorrow!).  Bring your own tackle and lunch, cover 1/2 the fuel, etc etc.  Check the forecast and dress for the occasion.  Will launch out of Jennette's Creek, travel/fish upper Michell's bay, the Thames river, and out in the lake if necessary.  There's definitely a good chance at a 50.  PM if interested."

945617,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-20 19:25:00,956,Was there today and caught nothing.  That's because I didn't even leave the boat ramp dock.  Battery died.
945618,OhioFisherman,2015-11-20 19:26:00,6623,"Good luck and take care, the weather might be a bit sketchy?"

That's because I didn't even leave the boat ramp dock.  Battery died.  OMG that sux.  I'm real anal with my batteries after I got stranded out on the water last year.  Now I have a 3 bank precision charger that informs me if there's an issue with any of the batteries and the 3rd bank is for charging/topping up my cranking battery.  Some may say its overkill but....."

I would have bought/ borrowed or stole another battery and salvaged what was left of the day.  Musky weather is late this year... (this was Nov 7th in 2007)     This picture sort of looks like a CO that would slap you in the head if you forgot your licence.  Is Lew wearing shorts?   Good luck at LSC, post a report if you can."
945773,lew,2015-11-21 10:21:00,12766,"That was a good day Wayne, no fish but lotsa laughs.  And Chris, that was a day I actually wore long pants LOL"
945783,OhioFisherman,2015-11-21 14:20:00,6623,"LOL, Lew, I remember dressing like that for work to try and stay warm, and they were paying me!"
945784,lew,2015-11-21 14:29:00,12766,"LOL, Lew, I remember dressing like that for work to try and stay warm, and they were paying me!  Cold always seems worse when you have to work in it compared to playing in it Paul"
945926,OhioFisherman,2015-11-22 15:57:00,6623,"LOL, yes Lew, playing in it you can set your own hours? Early April bass tournaments here were always like gambling, pay your entry fee a couple of weeks in advance and hope for the best?  I have seen some pictures, I can't imagine trying to fight a fire in it!"
945936,lew,2015-11-22 16:52:00,12766,"  I have seen some pictures, I can't imagine trying to fight a fire in it!  Some nights it was rather unpleasant Paul...to say the least"
945985,KraTToR,2015-11-23 02:34:00,506,Bah!  I didn't go.  As I didn't find a partner and some friends came over friday nite I just decided to screw it and party.  Theres still a few weeks left tho....
