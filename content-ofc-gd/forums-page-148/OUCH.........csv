I just became of retirement age and my CPP pension after 40+ years of contribution makes what the refugees will get look like change!  And I get asked to give more to charities where ever I go. HOW  MUCH can we give?
946533,cram,2015-11-26 02:01:00,1733,"Guelph businessman funds 50 Syrian refugee families GUELPH â€” A major effort is underway to bring 50 Syrian refugee families to Guelph in the coming weeks, a community-wide operation involving several faith groups, businesses, and social agencies. The entire effort is being backed financially by one Guelph entrepreneur. Jim Estill, president and chief executive officer of Danby, is donating the cash to support those 50 families in their first year of settlement. Sponsors of Syrian refugee families are required to have $25,000 to $30,000 per family ready to provide life essentials for an entire year. By this formula, Estill's donation could total $1.5 million. He confirmed his sponsorship on Tuesday, and said that supporting Syrian refugees is simply the right thing to do. ""This is not pure charity,"" Estill said in a telephone interview. ""You are not just giving people money. You're setting them up to have a life.""

He instead decides to delay the plan to allow for more time to process security checks, which the conservatives were demanding, and now they're rubbing their hands and saying ""see he broke a promise"".  You can't have it both ways.  When Harper had a majority it was okay to say ""but he had a majority so this is what Canadians want"", but now that ""the other guy"" has a majority and the shoe is on the other foot, I'm seeing a lot of foot stamping going on.  I'm not loyal to either party, I try to focus on the issues, but I have to admit to a bit of schadenfreude right now."

An effective opposition is as important to governance as an effective government.  The problem as I see it is that crying that the sky is falling on every issue is not being an effective opposition.  In the USA, the GOP is willing to filibuster or any other tactic they can to actually stop the government from functioning. This is contrary to the will of the people, who elected Obama. I think this has hurt the Republican image in the minds of millions of Americans.  It doesn't serve the Republican interest, or the country's interest to be that way."

They are directly responsible for the spawn of this band of misfits reigning terror worldwide. Its not my opinion either its just the way it is.

946440,moxie,2015-11-25 19:02:00,1566,   By the way. Liberals and other socialists have had the fear mongering market cornered for years. They prey on the fears of the weak.

946446,moxie,2015-11-25 19:13:00,1566,Exactly my point. Put them there to begin with and when they fail to tow your line its time to expidite their removal and consequences be damned.

946450,Dutch01,2015-11-25 19:24:00,1431,"I don't agree with this at all.  To hear Harper tell it, Justin was ""just not ready"", and the sky would fall on election night if we voted for him. The PC's spent more money and time on attack ads and negative politics than in any other Canadian election I can recall.  Canadians didn't buy it, and now the conservative party is on the outside looking in.  They couldn't even muster opposition status, so soundly were they rejected.  The Liberals accused Harper of eroding basic rights and freedoms, and they were correct (see Bill C51). They accused Harper of being divisive, and they were correct. They accused Harper of being behind the times, and for me personally, this is reflected in the fact he ignores science and the will of the people because of his personal beliefs (on issues such as the drug war for example).  However, when science didn't suit his agenda, as in the case of climate change, he just dismissed science and muzzled our scientists so they couldn't tell Canadians the truth.  This is not a man fit to lead. People who put belief ahead of science and fact are fundamentalists and no different than the Saudi's.  The jury is still out on Trudeau, at least for anyone with on open mind. Time will tell."

My point was that there are all kinds of conflicting numbers floating around and nobody really seems to have a good grip on all this.  The 1.2B number for the first 25,000 refugees was published in a number of papers yesterday by the CP but who really knows what the real numbers are now or, more importantly, what they will be in the end.  Another CP report states the numbers you posted which were released by the feds and don't include everything.
