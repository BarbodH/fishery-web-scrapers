946951,Acountdeleted,2015-11-29 01:12:00,2562,I don't follow follow boxing as much as I'd like. I was really hoping this was Mayweather Jr that got upset.

No killer instinct  Yeah, I saw some 'highlights'……very boring. But yeah, a shake up is maybe what is needed to breath life into what was once something I loved to watch. I can't stand the UFC nonsense."

I can't stand the UFC nonsense. I'm a combat sports fan, period.  My interest is more in MMA since boxing has become stale.  After the Mayweather / Pacquiao fight, there's nothing exciting left.  Still love certain fights and there's some I'll tune into, but mma has a lot of exciting matchups almost weekly."
