947055,chohenwald,2015-11-30 13:17:00,4,Hi guys.  I recently purchased a cottage on Haliburton Lake and was wondering if anyone here has ice fished this lake before? Any tips or locations worth checking out?  I can't wait to get out there! Thanks in advance. Chris.

947175,GBW,2015-11-30 23:42:00,8460,I grew up on that lake but never fished in in the winter way back then. Haven't been there in years either... We were on Delaney Dr (now shortened and called Delaney Rd). It was named after my grandfather for bringing 'hydro' to the area. Good luck Chris and yes there are some BIG lakers in there!

947255,Sinker,2015-12-01 12:09:00,8692,I havent fished there in a few years but there are also whities in there. Beautiful lake!  S.
947264,ckewley,2015-12-01 12:41:00,699,"I've fished the opposite end from you, a friend has a cottage on Dignan rd. not at all familiar with the lake but did notice the huts seemed to follow a trench. Folks on the outside of the trench did poorly (us) ones on the drop off did ok. A couple of lakers & whities were caught, nothing huge but we hit the lake the night after a huge drop in temp, went from -5 (high) to -35 (never mind the wind chill) planning on a return trip this year."
