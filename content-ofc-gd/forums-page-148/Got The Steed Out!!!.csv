947004,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-29 22:21:00,10439,Finally finished the work on my truck for the trip to Ontario next week so it was time to tune and maintain the sled for season. Got her all cleaned and shined up then I took her for a short ride. We're still hurtin' big time in the snow dept. though. Hopefully a bunch will fall while I'm down South visitin' and chasing steel.  Here's a few pic of her in her Sunday best!!!          Hard to believe she's 8 years old now.
