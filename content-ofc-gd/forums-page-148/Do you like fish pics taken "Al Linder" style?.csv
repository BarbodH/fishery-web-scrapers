947285,Beavertail,2015-12-01 14:58:00,331,"I like seeing close up detail of the whole fish (couldn't care less about the guy holding it) So holding them out doesn't bother me....what I don't like are these low angle shots which also seem popular, when the fish is facing the camera so all you see is this big head and gaping mouth. I don't get it???"
947288,lew,2015-12-01 15:10:00,12766,If guys learned how to actually catch big fish they wouldn't have to straight arm them to make them look big on websites
947291,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-01 15:35:00,956,"If I could get away with adding a couple of extra inches why not haha.  ""I swear it was a 60"" musky I swear"""
947299,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-01 15:56:00,10439,I have been guilty of this in the past I guess I only catch small fish. It makes me feel better about my inferior fishing skills  Admitting you have a problem is the first step to recovery!!! Good on ya brother!!! You can do it!!!!
947344,NAW,2015-12-01 18:40:00,4022,"It ones of those things.  I do it, but I'm laughing at myself inside for doing it!!  I know it's silly, and obvious.  And I laugh out-loud when I see other people doing it.  But as soon as the camera comes out, my elbow locks straight.  I can't fight it, I just let it happen."
947355,Brettiop,2015-12-01 20:47:00,279,"I'm Okay with it, to a certain degree...  I usually hold them about half way out...I can take a picture of me any day, I'm only holding that awesome fish for a few seconds....i wanna make sure the fish looks good!  I'd rather see more of the fish then the angler for the most part...  Only fish that are too big should be held against your body, i think that just looks dumb...."
947433,chris.brock,2015-12-02 02:05:00,4053,Anyone want to guess the weights of these fish from the Chutes? Just for fun. I still remember the exact weights. There's some different photography styles in the pics.

947201,bigcreekdad,2015-12-01 01:10:00,546,"I'm really getting tired of these...the fish held out so much with a certain camera view that greatly enlarges them. You really have no clue as to size of the fish. Seems like more and more pics are ""staged"" like this.  Maybe I'm just getting old and cranky."
947203,Dozer,2015-12-01 01:12:00,896,I love them - more focus on the fish and less on my ugly mug.
947204,Freshtrax,2015-12-01 01:14:00,2215,I mostly focus on at least hiding my hand near the head of the fish makes for a prettier picture...
947205,chris.brock,2015-12-01 01:26:00,4053,I don't see what you're blabbing about.  
947206,GBW,2015-12-01 01:26:00,8460,duno... 
947208,Dozer,2015-12-01 01:30:00,896,Great advertising tactic used by many
947211,Raf,2015-12-01 01:34:00,3495,The best ones are with guys leaning so far back it looks like they are about to fall out of the boat.
947214,bigcreekdad,2015-12-01 01:40:00,546,So far...the responses indicate I'm just an old grouch
947216,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-01 01:40:00,10439,Typical for anglers who can't catch big fish. I just hold them close to my body as the weight of the behemoths would tear tendons and muscle if I held them out like that!!!!       I guess if all I caught were tiny fish I would hold them out too!!!
947217,richyb,2015-12-01 01:43:00,774,Now guys are also doing that with deer. I dont like it .. Sure it makes them look huge but now every fish or buck looks like the new world record.
947220,porkpie,2015-12-01 01:50:00,2521,"I like any kind of fish picture, near or far!"

947222,chris.brock,2015-12-01 01:53:00,4053,"So far...the responses indicate I'm just an old grouch  Nope, I agree with you. Some pics there's no way to tell if it's 8lbs or 18 lbs.  Dave, you're hiding your hands in that Beteau pic. If you're 6', I would guess around 22 lbs."
947223,manitoubass2,2015-12-01 02:02:00,11391,I have no issues if its showcasing the fish.  Nobody is ignorant enough to believe a 3lb bass is an 8lber etc  Whatever floats your boat  Every mag and show does it for the most part
947224,Rod Caster,2015-12-01 02:09:00,5784,if I were cranky and old I'd say stop watching tv and fish more
947229,Moosebunk,2015-12-01 02:25:00,3970,"No issues with it for the most part, not until there's a claim that it is something it's not."
947230,captpierre,2015-12-01 02:28:00,2521,Special lens too! Wide angle?
947231,grimsbylander,2015-12-01 02:45:00,3016,"I agree as well. Some of the pics I see posted are simply ridiculous. When I see a bass and it's as long as half the guy is tall, I think its takes away from the picture and reduces credibility. I spend no time looking at long-arm pics."
947237,smitty55,2015-12-01 04:01:00,928,"I don't see what you're blabbing about.    Lol Chris that's a perfect example of the EAP  (extended arm pic)  I'm with the OP on this one. I don't see it as showcasing as much as trying to make a fish look bigger to boost someones ego. Honestly, it just kinda bugs me when I see guys intentionally making 2-3 lb fish look like hogs, hoping to fool the unsuspecting. But whatever... With the real big ones you can usually tell but even a 5lb walleye can easily be made to look like a 10+. Just look for the sausage fingers hehe. That's why as a rule I rarely comment on pics anymore, except for the obvious ones. Even then it's still hard to tell for sure sometimes. A tape picture is great to prove length, and a weight to justify the pic would be nice but I fully understand that posting a weight just puts folks at risk of criticism, as pics are so easy to manipulate.  Btw Chris, that's quite the buddy you have looking in on ya from the garage door window lol. Must be a story there.  Cheers"

947249,Roy,2015-12-01 11:09:00,13728,I Like fish pics.I don't care how the pics were taken. They're still much better than looking at pics of what everyone had for supper the night before.The difference between the two is that holding a fish pic out makes the fish look like a pig.....holding your meal out makes YOU look like a pig.
947251,Garnet,2015-12-01 11:20:00,2056,"I would like to be a little guy like Al that makes fish look big.  It's really funny with the young guys, you just look at the pic count and that's how many fish they have caught total."
947258,BillM,2015-12-01 12:28:00,17367,"There's so much trickery when it comes to photography..   If you've got an eye for it, you just laugh at those certain types of pictures...    The guys holding the fish 4ft away from their bodies are the best ones though, they look like midgets!"
947270,wkrp,2015-12-01 13:05:00,656,Some chapter in his good book told him it was ok to do so..
