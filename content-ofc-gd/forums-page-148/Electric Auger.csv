946225,manitoubass2,2015-11-24 21:26:00,11391,You did
946226,Joeytier,2015-11-24 21:27:00,3990,No gas/oil mix to worry about. You did  Edit:  Manitou beat me to the punch lol
946228,misfish,2015-11-24 21:36:00,29133,"I didnt say I didnt know how, thanks. Got me sorta I guess..  No.gas and oil to mix to worry about."
946290,manitoubass2,2015-11-25 01:02:00,11391,"Lol you build some awesome stuff brian, off course you can mix oil and gas ???  I wont be going to drill or electric anytime soon I dont think?  Two years ago I got a brand new 8""eskimo for 200 bucks and shes a dandy!"
946293,akaShag,2015-11-25 01:15:00,2073,"back to m2b2, ""SHE's a dandy?Was it Eskimo Nell you bought for two hundred bucks?  Just curious...............  Doug"
946318,manitoubass2,2015-11-25 02:58:00,11391,"No. Its an eskimo shark i bought off a friend(it was used twice), i think he had some debt issues because he was selling his bass boat etc too.  He asked 300, i said maybe, he said 200 and ill drive it to you right now.  Bang sold! Works like a charm!"
946319,manitoubass2,2015-11-25 03:05:00,11391,Oh choke switch on it was garbage though(plastic)  So with the advice i got on OFC i contacted the company and they sent two replacements(not plastic lol)
945650,Fisherman,2015-11-20 21:57:00,7201,"Anyone looking for Lithium ion Augers, CTC has them on sale this week, pretty much sold out already, but they'll give you a rain check.   They're $150 off.  Besides, my shoulder and back don't like the recoil starting anymore and I sold my 1992 Jiffy 30 for more than what I bought it for brand new.  $181 in West Baraboo Wisconsin."
945665,Big Cliff,2015-11-20 22:36:00,6899,So how mich are they? I just use my 20V DeWalt and that does as a multi tool for me.
945668,misfish,2015-11-20 22:39:00,29133,"He stole it Cliff. ( Nice score Enrich) Im staying with my cordless as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,for now. I am waiting to see another battery one that should be in someones hands soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I THINK."
945672,Fisherman,2015-11-20 22:50:00,7201,"$549 for the 8"" one.  I figure if I have to buy a big drill, the chummy to hold the drill and auger together plus the auger part, it will be about the same or more than the Lithium Ion."
945683,ecmilley,2015-11-20 23:44:00,2163,"$549 for the 8"" one.  I figure if I have to buy a big drill, the chummy to hold the drill and auger together plus the auger part, it will be about the same or more than the Lithium Ion. the adapter for my swede bore is like 10 bux, auger was $30 already had the dewalt but to not to bad 2 baterys would get me 40 holes with 8-10 inches of ice with 24 -30 was like 7 holes a battery. those ions look nice though and can do 1000 inches of ice on a charge more than enough"
945689,misfish,2015-11-20 23:57:00,29133,"Enrich I hear ya on the price thing. Finbor 3 ,s are 60-100 bux. My drill package was 385. ( milwackie with 2x 4hr batteries and charger) I am now going to be buying the new clam adaptor. Thats another 100 bux. I,ll bet though, I,ll get just as many hole as the ION. Thats $585.  My question though, how you going to use that thing in the summer?"
945691,Fisherman,2015-11-21 00:12:00,7201,"Well, I can always stir some margaritas or paint.."

Other than that, the weight factor it's a bunch lighter."
945699,misfish,2015-11-21 00:39:00,29133,"Well, I can always stir some margaritas ..   That works for me, lol"
945724,ketchenany,2015-11-21 01:56:00,3229,"Change, to your right shoulder, changing always helps, poor guy in Wisconsin with a bad shoulder!  B, you stir your drinks with a drill? i have lots of very, very clean 25 L pails to give away!"
945732,Fisherman,2015-11-21 02:13:00,7201,"That would be like trying to swing a left handed golf club with a right hand, I think I'd be spinning around like a top.."
945792,manitoubass2,2015-11-21 18:34:00,11391,Thats me too hahaha
945957,akaShag,2015-11-22 21:11:00,2073,and I hear that the electric drill auger lets you sneak up on sleeping fish!  Doug
945959,manitoubass2,2015-11-22 21:17:00,11391,Thats funny cause i drill holes and it seems to attract fish
945960,misfish,2015-11-22 21:28:00,29133,"No gas/oil mix to worry about. No burning your suit on the muffler. More then half the weight of a gas jobber.  Heres the kicker doing it my way. The drill dies,I have the handle handy to keep fishing. Try that with the  gaser."
945961,mr blizzard,2015-11-22 21:31:00,1589,"Fisherman,,, a guy we saw a couple of times last year ice fishing  has one and loves it I was totally surprised at its capability  Yes Rick I am with you the auger seems to draw them in"
945965,manitoubass2,2015-11-22 21:44:00,11391,Not a worry with a well kept eskimo?  And a sled or truck lol
945966,manitoubass2,2015-11-22 21:47:00,11391,"Not just draw them in, it seems to help them bite.  When it slows down drill 2 or 3 more holes and the bite turns back on!  Magic! Lol"

The drill dies,I have the handle handy to keep fishing. Try that with the  gaser. I have a Nils Master auger with the Tanaka engine.  It is VERY light (especailly compared to my old Jiffy!) and each drill blade comes with a handle so it can be used manually.  It cuts VERY fast and doesn't wreck my back.  BUT!!!  It still uses mixed fuel, it still makes noise, and you still have to pull the cord to start it.  I understand the attraction of the electric ones, and indeed I have a buddy in Manitoba who uses one to cut through very thick ice.  But so far I am still in love with my Nils Master.  Doug"

Doug   I have a bud that has the same unit Doug. I never did try the nils myself,but always heard great things about them. Im a finbor 3 guy. Cuts real nice. No pressure on the blades at all to cut a hole. Just spin the blades."
945974,RickOnt,2015-11-22 22:47:00,669,Yes Doug   That Nils auger with the Tanaka power head is the best of the best  but it does come with a big  pri$$$$$e   tag

But I am an older guy with a cranky back and needed something lightweight that can still cut ice well.  This one is really the best power auger I ever saw.  And when it is ready to go to a new home, then maybe I will get me one of them LECTRIC augers!  Doug"
946098,Joeytier,2015-11-24 04:21:00,3990,"Worry about mixed gas?  Mix a 5 gallon jerry can once or twice and you're good for the year.  I'm not gonna rely on a cordless battery when I'm drilling thru 25-30"" of ice in -30.  As for the electrics...they seem to be getting rave reviews from lots of people that live in areas with many months of 2-4' of ice, but they're no cheaper and not much lighter than a 2stroker gas auger.  I'd feel better about troubleshooting a small 2stroker than a battery powered engine on the ice."
946214,Sinker,2015-11-24 20:48:00,8692,"Ditto. Give me a 2 stroke gas engine any day.  I get a real laugh out of guys who complain about mixing gas. Like seriously, is it that hard to put 20ml of oil in each litre of gas?? Pretty simple math.  S."
946224,misfish,2015-11-24 21:25:00,29133,Who said anything ABOUT MIXING GAS ???????????????????
