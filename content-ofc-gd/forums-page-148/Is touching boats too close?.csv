We'd just had 1 hit among all of us.. 2 guys made a beeline out from the shore towards us. We told them we weren't catching anything but I guess they didn't believe us. The plunked themselves down in 2 of our holes. It was more amusing than annoying. After about 1/2 hr of 'not catching(as we were busy doing) they were on the phone and went elsewhere---presumably to their buddies who were catching. I guess we thought it funny how they assumed that 4-5 of us gathered fairly cloes together must be catching fish!!

I was shore fishing with my friend in Cannel Lake under the big bridge, 12am midnight, we were facing the main lake and catching Walleye and Crappie, we heard a whole FAMILY(FATHER, MOTHER, LITTLE BIY AND LITTLE GIRL) was climbing down to the other side of the bridge, then after awhile, my friend suddenly asked me to watch my back, when I turn my head to my right, there was a rod just 2 feet beside my head and that guy said: ""don't worry me, I see you"". What the FXXX. Then I told my friend to leave and on my way home I told my friend, I will buy a boat. After that, I thought  I will get away from this kind of thing. BUT NO! 2004, I fished in Rice, I found a nice drop off then throw out a marker. me and my buddy had lots of fun until a bot of five stop close to us and cast to our marker............ I asked them what are they doing with our marker........ the reply is "" is that your marker?"" 2008, Last trip on rice, Bewley shore fall fishing with Walleye, my buddy said he will like to try late fall fishing at Bewley, I went with my elder son, 3 of us arrive there before sunset, during sunset, people start catching. when I TURN and bend down to change lure, a guy was already stand behind me and fishing on my spot. when I stood up, I knew somebody was there. I wait until he finished a few cast, I asked him "" You try my spot already, can I have it back?"" His reply in a loud voice "" I fish here all the time, there no such thing your spot or my spot!"". I was putting down my rod.... then somebody asked the guy "" Come Back "". The other morning, my wife said my son scare I will push that guy in to the lake.  I just don't really understand these people why they have to do this kind of things, respect the other is not hard why they don't think about it."

I was HAMMERING them but because they were RUDE and not respectful I kept my big trap shut while the three of them occasionally caught a crappie all while I caught one on every cast.

There may not be an actual law giving shore anglers the right of way but it makes sense as a courtesy.  Disrupting boat traffic would only be an issue if the boat is navigating a narrow channel.

944701,Gallie,2015-11-14 18:24:00,1215,"I know why, because average joe can only take so much before he snaps, if you are at the bar and some goon gets on ya and you walk away, when your driving and someone near runs you off the road and you leave it alone, when your boss or coworker is on your ass about something and you bite your lip, sooner or later its going to come out. And what better time then when you are spending your small amount of free time trying to relax and do what you love only to be run around by a bunch of idiots on the water. A man can only take so much and eventually he will bare his teeth, maybe some of the saints among us can hold it in forever but not me."

944705,adam lancia,2015-11-14 18:35:00,234,"Gallie, I understand where you're coming from. A drunk goon at the bar can be dealt with by embarrassing them most of the time. That boss or co-worker, have a conversation. Failing that, depending on how much you like/need your job, escalate things. If someone nearly runs you off the road, get their license plate and report them, then be happy you weren't hurt.  The worst thing to do is to hold it all in, then you get an internal pressure that builds and builds, only to be set off by a situation which requires absolutely zero violence. Not only that, the violent reaction will likely be out of whack with the situation and with the potential for bodily harm, could result in serious legal trouble for the person being violent. Do you really want to go to jail when yonge just out trying to enjoy your leisure time...? If you want to exercise a violent streak, join the armed forces or take up any number of fighting sports. But please don't passing the rest of us anglers with the brush of someone who chooses to deal with a very minor situation in an inappropriate manner."

Its one thing to move in on a good spot someone else is on, but to actually hit their boat.....your not getting away with that without a good ear full at the very least.....if it escalates, they need a good lesson.  Im a very easy going guy, a lover, not a fighter, but pure ignorance like that, I will not tolerate.   Now, if they appologized, and moved off, I would calm down.....if the ignorance continued, we'd have a problem.  The guys that hit my dad and I were so ignorant, they claimed we didnt own the lake, and they could fish wherever the f---- they want. We were anchored on that spot for hours.....it escalated.

It wasn't like there was any damage done other then making my lovely outing a lil off kilter. The only thing other then yelling i could do was pull my cell outa my pocket and snap this pic...I mean who would ever believe me that this could actually happen?  Thanks for all the comments.  I won't dare post the pic of the second group of guys....rolled up past me fairly to find there spot. 3 guys 4 lines in the water. Yelled at them to get extra line in. Guy told me it was ""only a short line"" after i told them I'd hate to see them fined one guy quickly jump up and reeled the line in.  On the other hand the fishing was decent."

We were the only boat on the lake until off in the distance I hear a boat coming. We watch as he goes along the far shore then makes a 90 and comes right towards us, 3 guys in a bassboat. They pull directly in front of me, not 30' away, and the driver says good morning.  I didn't answer him but threw my next cast right at his fancy boat and bounced a very large spinnerbait of the side of it. He yelled at me to be carefull and I said I couldn't help hitting him as he parked right on the spot I was casting at. I fired my next cast and scored another bullseye.  He mumbled something about me being a jerk as he fired up his motor and they left to go harrass someone else.  Most guys you meet on the water are good but every now and then we have to put up with morons."

There's no need or excuse for acting in such a manner, that's flat out ignorant. Period. The fact that they initiated contact with you is pretty messed up. Did you get their boat registration number?
