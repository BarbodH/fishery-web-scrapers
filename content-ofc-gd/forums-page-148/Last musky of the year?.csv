946511,Rizzo,2015-11-26 00:26:00,4754,"We got this musky last week on what I THOUGHT was my last trip of the year. (sorry don't know how to make pic full size)   Anyway, so my buddy calls me just after I have changed the oil, stabilized the gas, vaccuumed the boat, changed the oil in the hubs etc etc...he wants to go again. What's a guy to do?"
946513,Gallie,2015-11-26 00:32:00,1215,"Thats a sweet fish, id go again!"
946520,lew,2015-11-26 00:56:00,12766,Purdy fish Roger
946525,captpierre,2015-11-26 01:19:00,2521,Nice fish. Just don't ask about re fogging your engine ?
946526,cram,2015-11-26 01:25:00,1733,Beauty. Looks like a great day.
946527,Rizzo,2015-11-26 01:31:00,4754,"haha...hadn't fogged it yet. Funny thing, it is a Yamaha. Not the first time this guy has tried to convince me to take the boat outta bed. Did it 3 or 4 years ago too. That time I did. Got to the launch and found about 100 feet of inch thick ice! Took us close to an hour to smash thru the ice with an anchor. We got a nice musky that day tho!"
946528,kickingfrog,2015-11-26 01:33:00,8333,Beauty Roger. Good to see you're staying safe with the orange toque.
946531,Pigeontroller,2015-11-26 01:57:00,2793,"Never, ever, clean the boat for winter before December 15th!"

946573,mistaredone,2015-11-26 13:48:00,913,Nice one!
946632,misfish,2015-11-26 20:50:00,29133,"Nice fish there Rog   FYI, The way you posted the pic is fine. It enlarges when you click on it."
946636,PBenson,2015-11-26 21:49:00,154,With the weather being so warm gotta keep going!
946647,Lunkerhunter,2015-11-26 23:10:00,455,There was a touch of ice on scugog near the causeway this week. It's gone now as the last days have been much warmer.  That being said I'm planning on fishing the kawarthas for at least two more weekends. Lots of time left for some more muskies. Lol
946665,Rizzo,2015-11-27 00:03:00,4754,"Fine...I am in! Thought that fish was a good way to end the season...but you never know, there might be a better one waiting. Some of my biggest fish have come right at the end of each year, here's hoping!"
946686,Fisherpete,2015-11-27 02:08:00,1814,Still a few weeks to find that giant - go get her! Nice fish by he way.
946688,KraTToR,2015-11-27 02:28:00,506,Mine (boat) is still sitting on the driveway.  I ran some antifreeze through the LW and Bilge pumps and that's it (it went to -10 the other night).  With a fall we're having there's still plenty of fishing left.  Hitting LSC this weekend and the Niagara river on the 4th.  Then we'll see....
946692,ehg,2015-11-27 03:35:00,2666,Nice chunky Kawartha fish. Great stuff! No matter what it is brutal out there at this time of year with the shortened daylight and winter like conditions.
946770,esoxansteel,2015-11-27 19:38:00,1307,Nice fish there Rog
946921,Moosebunk,2015-11-28 19:17:00,3970,Great fish and photo Riz!
