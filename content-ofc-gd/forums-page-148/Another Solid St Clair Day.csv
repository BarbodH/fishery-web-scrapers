945875,PBenson,2015-11-22 02:36:00,154,"It's been a tough week with work and weather so I haven't fished much, but I got out last night and we went 2/2 in under two hours. The weather is back to being terrible so I thought I'd make a video out of it. Both fish were caught on Shadzillas which have become my favourite bait this year. And yes I know my net sucks haha, I just spent $1000 on a new shark fishing set up so I need to delay the net expense to next year. Let me know what you think on the fish/video!  "
945876,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-22 02:39:00,956,Well I know what I'm doing in the morning.  Heading to the bait store and grabbing a Shadzilla.  Well done
945877,captpierre,2015-11-22 02:52:00,2521,Outstanding!
945884,BillM,2015-11-22 03:26:00,17367,Right on man!  Beauty muskie!
945910,Rizzo,2015-11-22 13:32:00,4754,nice! Where are all the other boats though? Everytime I fish that spot there is a line up! I guess fishing the evening gives some privacy
945912,mike rousseau,2015-11-22 13:36:00,4661,Nice fishing boys  I've been looking at getting some shadzillas.... They look great
945916,Pigeontroller,2015-11-22 13:53:00,2793,****
945917,PBenson,2015-11-22 14:04:00,154,The winds on this day were 30km/h with gusts of 45 until 330pm. I think that must have deterred everyone from going out. They were SW winds though so this spot was protected for the most part
945938,Rizzo,2015-11-22 17:27:00,4754,ya if I see winds like that I definitely make the 3 hour drive to the  Kawarthas rather than the 3 hour drive to St. Clair...man Guelph sucks for distance to my favourite fishing holes
945963,mr blizzard,2015-11-22 21:35:00,1589,"Beauty, good for u, that's one fish I never was able to catch :tease:but that's not surprising"
945969,PBenson,2015-11-22 21:49:00,154,I highly recommend it man. Not only do they work really well but they also take less of a toll of your body than throwing pounders all day. Much lighter and you don't need to work them as much.
945970,manitoubass2,2015-11-22 21:54:00,11391,Nice going! Wow!
946001,msp,2015-11-23 16:49:00,1336,Cool vids. just checked out your page. Well done !
946005,jimmer,2015-11-23 18:20:00,2730,Nice to see people out on the water still. Great catch!
946011,PBenson,2015-11-23 19:20:00,154,Thanks guys. Hoping to get out and film a few more times in the next few weeks before it gets too cold. I want to get a 50 on film!!
946013,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-23 19:29:00,956,Hope so too.  Good luck
946016,mepps,2015-11-23 19:48:00,1301,"Nicely done! I was hoping to hit LSC this year, but haven't been able to make it happen - good to see some solid muskie being caught!"
946030,BITEME,2015-11-23 21:43:00,1968,Nice fish(s)  I really like your boat set up amazingly stable can you tell abut about it please Cheers Peter
946074,James77,2015-11-24 02:36:00,175,Great video bud!
946103,PBenson,2015-11-24 05:23:00,154,"It's nothing special, just a 13 ft Boston Whaler. Small but gets the job done."
946924,Moosebunk,2015-11-28 19:26:00,3970,Watching this I need to #1 - extend Autumn by about 10 more days a year so I can #2 - head back down to St. Clair again.  Good fishing and tips.
946980,PBenson,2015-11-29 15:57:00,154,Thank you! Heading out for a few hours later today to see if I can put a few more in the boat
