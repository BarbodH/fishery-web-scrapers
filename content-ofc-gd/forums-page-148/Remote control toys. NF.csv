945852,captpierre,2015-11-22 00:30:00,2521,Thinking of getting the nephews remote control helicopters for Christmas. Saw a rather large one at Bass Pro for $65 Says its indistructable.  Takes 6 AA batteries in the controls and then the chopper has a rechargeable battery built in. 200 ft range. Are there different qualities to these things? Things to stay away from? I don't want it to die on them in the first week.
945854,aplumma,2015-11-22 00:46:00,6896,Getting a drone is more likely a better choice. The drone is easier to control and will run about the same price. Here is a good starter one.   This is available from Amazon for less than $50.00 USD   Art
945856,captpierre,2015-11-22 00:51:00,2521,Yeah. Was wondering about a drone. This is the chopper   
945873,Cast-Away,2015-11-22 02:15:00,790,"When you crash these cheap helicopters you can't get replacement parts. The issue will be when you turn it to fly towards you, the controls are now opposite. I have been flying RC planes for years and this is where everyone struggle. Keep it small for a child to keep it as an indoor toy."
945882,Fisherman,2015-11-22 03:22:00,7201,"And when you're flying upside down, don't forget to push instead of pull, otherwise you'll meet terra firma at a high rate of speed."
945887,irishfield,2015-11-22 03:43:00,26272,That's what made RC fun... this Bull of auto home is for amateurs and those that like to climb trees!
945907,Big Cliff,2015-11-22 11:03:00,6899,"Well, first of all, how old are they? Some of these things can be dangerous, even the blades on some of the smaller helicopters can cut like a knife.  If you do get them RC toys, make sure they can be switched to different frequencies or they won't both be able to fly/control them at the same time.  I have had a few different helicoptors over the years then got a drone, much easier to fly and a lot more fun!  The drone that Art posted looks like an excellent starter unit.  Make sure you get units that use RF rather than IR for control the IR units don't work well out doors. Whatever units you do buy, make sure spare parts are available, there will be a few crashes in the beginning LOL."
945919,captpierre,2015-11-22 14:32:00,2521,As usual you guys come through with good advice. The boys are 10 and 12 yrs old. They live in Muskoka in the woods with lots of open space. Are both home schooled and very smart. Looks like the Syma quadcopter would be a better idea. Looks like it doesn't come with batteries. Should we get several with a charger?  Spare rotors?  Several of us uncles are going in on this so the extra expense is not a big deal. BTW got them rods/reels last year.
945925,Fisherman,2015-11-22 15:57:00,7201,"Yes a spare set of batteries makes the fun last longer, spare blades, yes unless you can buy them next door."

The batteries take 3.5 hours to charge so more is better. The motors can burn out but are less than 10 dollars a set so no issues. The crashing does not usually damage the blades but it comes with a spare set. The motors usually burn out if they can not turn but are held in place like grass launches or in a tree and turning on to fly yourself free. You also can order the whole drone without the controller for half the price of the whole unit.    Art"

I'd pick up a quad instead.    There are several on sale this weekend due to Black Friday.  I picked one up at TSC for $60.  It even has a built in camera.   Some other places like Walmart and Staples have a Parrot drone for $99.   These are smaller ones.   http://flyers.smartcanucks.ca/canada/tsc-stores-flyer-november-26-to-december-3/single/1 http://flyers.smartcanucks.ca/canada/tsc-stores-flyer-november-26-to-december-3/single/2   http://www.redflagdeals.com/flyers/staples/weekly-black-friday-nov-25-to-dec-01-2015-56955/   Here's a video of that drone they're selling at TSC.
