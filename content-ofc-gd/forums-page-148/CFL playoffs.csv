946120,Mike Pike,2015-11-24 13:50:00,1332,"The Hamilton-Ottawa game last Sunday was one of the best games I've ever seen!  And I'm a Cats fan!!!  Didn't like the outcome, obviously, but pretty amazed at the performance of the Ti-Cats and their 4th string quarterback!  Masoli took the Cats to a near victory until Ottawa's hail Mary with 2 minutes left in the game.  Oskee Boo Hoo hoo..."
946122,mr blizzard,2015-11-24 14:12:00,1589,Mike I was cheering for Hamilton also but considering where Ottawa came from last season I am sure they will give it their all in Winnipeg   The cfl is one great league often overlooked except for those that watch lol
946137,Mike Pike,2015-11-24 15:13:00,1332,"I agree Blizz.  Love the game and I love TSN's presentation of it.  Unfortunately, because TSN( Bell Media )has the CFL as an exclusive, Sportsnet stations( Rodgers )don't report on the league at all anymore and I think that harms the league by limiting it's exposure."

946145,mr blizzard,2015-11-24 15:57:00,1589,"I agree with u Mike Pike re coverage  Mr Borger from previous posts I know u have been a die hard Hamilton fan for years , just don't take the iv out till the nurse says so lol, I hear a good prescription to get over the pain is a fishing trip or two with some guy called Drifter  :tease:"
946242,vance,2015-11-24 22:18:00,719,Well if you are going to watch the Grey Cup on Sunday you JUST HAVE TO WATCH the Vanier Cup on Saturday when the Montreal Carabins meet the B.C. Thunderbirds for the CIS Football championship. Quite often this is a better game than the Grey Cup.  vance
