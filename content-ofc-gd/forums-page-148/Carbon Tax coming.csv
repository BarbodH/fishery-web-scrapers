News outlets are reporting that individuals will see an increase in fuel costs equating to about 2-3 cents/ litre of gas sold. Don't get me wrong, I do care about the environment and the environment my children will be living in, but I fail to understand how me paying more for fuel helps the environment? Indications are that the funds raised will go towards low income families, but how exactly is that helping the environment? I have a call into my local MPP for clarification and I await a call back.  Anyone have any idea how this is going to work? Is it just another tax for our cash starved governments to collect? thanks,  HH"

I did learn that the tax is to be geared toward industry, rather than the consumer, but in the end, so to speak, the consumer is likely to be absorbing the tax, should that industry not meet it's agreed amounts and have to pay the tax. They are using Quebec and California's examples as templates for how they are planning on implementing our Carbon Tax. They also indicated that the revenue generated, will be put toward investment into new technologies and the environment, not the big pool. I'm going to keep an eye on this and have been invited to call back should I have any further questions. HH"
946192,cram,2015-11-24 19:59:00,1733,"I'm in favor of a carbon tax if it's net is revenue neutral (charge the polluters, pass savings to non polluters) but if it's just a cash grab then that's another story.  I also wonder how they implement it in concert with a TPP when products-from-far-away should naturally have more carbon tax attached to them (which is a good thing if you like buying from Canada instead of Asia).....but wouldn't that go against free trade?  Also wonder how produce from california or mexico in the winter isn't going to suddenly be more expensive.  Does this mean poor kids eat more processed and rich kids get to eat fresh produce?  Will be interesting to see how they plan to do it.  I worry it's just a cash grab."
