I was using my 12v battery from my flasher over the summer with my hummingbird fish finder. I could have swore they both used the same battery (worked great with my hummingbird) but now I plug it into my charger and it says it's fully charged. The charger. Have is just one of those small ones that have a red, green, and yellow light. Regardless of what I do, the light stays green saying that battery is charged. Yet when I plug it in to the flasher or fish finder nothing works.  I get the feeling I probably fried it and need a new one, but I'm open to suggestions as I can't really do any more damage.  (Saving some time, yes I checked, the flasher and hummingbird cords are all attached and in good condition. No I don't have another battery to test everything with)."
946995,ecmilley,2015-11-29 18:42:00,2163,First check then open circuit voltage of the battery. Try the charger on sething else. but those small betterys only $25-30 anyway
946996,misfish,2015-11-29 18:55:00,29133,Your battery is pouched.  I have the proper charger and have had a few batterys do the same. NO POWER.
947019,SirCranksalot,2015-11-30 00:04:00,3291,Have you tried leaving it hooked up to the charger regardless of what it says. Maybe the charger is giving you a false indication. Do you have a reg car batt charger with a 2 amp setting?
947078,Acountdeleted,2015-11-30 16:47:00,2562,I do. I plugged it in overnight. If it doesn't charge I'll try the trickle charge tonight.
