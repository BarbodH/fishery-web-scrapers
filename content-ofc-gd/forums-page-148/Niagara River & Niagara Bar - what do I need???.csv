If he attacked you go nuts, but he was giving his opinion for Krattor. Krattor will do what he wants to do in the end. Good way to alienate members here."
947425,captpierre,2015-12-02 01:08:00,2521,Just looked it up. Devils Hole. Is that between the outflows of the Hydro Plants? Upstream from the bridge. Isn't that where the charter  boat got partially sucked under and 2 guests were lost?
947070,KraTToR,2015-11-30 15:44:00,506,"My first time going after trout (from a boat) this time of year and an earlier recommendation from a OFC member is to go after trout on the lower Niagara river...  I've done some research but I would like to hear it from the xperts! I would really like to put some trout in the boat for the smoker...m,mmmm smoked trout at christmas.  Maybe that will get me back into the Mrs's good books??  Time will tell..lol  This will be my last boat trip until the spring so I'd like to finish on a positive note..  :santa:  TIA! Thanks In Advance!    "
947083,dave524,2015-11-30 17:06:00,4508,"Been a long time since I've drifted there, but, I recommend going with some one who knows the drifts and how to control the boat or with a guide the first time. The first trips there are learning experiences . I'd launch at Queenston."
947091,captpierre,2015-11-30 17:32:00,2521,Check the MNR guide to eating fish outta there.
947116,Beavertail,2015-11-30 19:00:00,331,"Far from an expert here, but it's pretty straight forward. Launch out of Queenston. I've done well on the bar just drifting using a 1oz sinker tied on a 3-way rig. We used 3-4"" shiners and had a blast catching Lakers on fairly light tackle. Keeping your line vertical by using a trolling motor helps but it's not critical, at least on the bar. The river is another story as currents and eddies will spin your boat around."
947135,msp,2015-11-30 20:49:00,1336,"Probably would need a U.S. license, but not required. Most of the best drifts are in U.S waters. As stated here, a 3 way rig with 1 oz. pencil lead, 6# flouro leaders with shiners, roe bags, beads and even quick fish"
947139,landry,2015-11-30 20:59:00,1005,"The best drifts in the river are U.S. Side. U can get a one day license online for $15. Launch at queenston and fish right there in the back eddy, drifting upstream, on CDn side or cut upstream at 45* angle and fish the artpark Drift on US side. Follow the crowd. 1 oz lead on a three way setup with 6' of leader to your bait. Use your TM to chase your line and stay vertical. Don't get too tight to shore till u get comfy. I try to keep an eye on depth and glide my lead just over bottom. I find this helps feel bites which are usually subtle dead weight. The constant tap of bottom makes it hard to decipher bottom from fish. It ain't rocket science. I usually do well there. However, whenever i see Paul Castellano there he humbles me by at least doubling my numbers."
947149,Mister G,2015-11-30 22:21:00,1429,"I agree on getting a NYS fishing license, at least the one day license and see how you like the river. With both licenses you have better options on where you might fish depending on wind. Queenston launch is your best option. I haven't fished the lower river in some time but I would think at this time of the year Quick Fish lures might be your best option. Use a med heavy spinning rod with 10-12# mono line and a 3 way with the one once sinker on only 6# test line. Be prepared for many snags at first. Watch others and don't be afraid to join them, however always give other anglers lots of space between your boat and theirs. No need to crowd them even though your drifting the same drifts.  The bar is a LONG ride down river.......If I were you I would skip that drift for another day and for now just learn the drifts near the launch on both sides of the river.  DRESS WARM as if you were going ice fishing.  Good Luck and have FUN ! ! !"

947151,chris.brock,2015-11-30 22:40:00,4053,"For a first trip, I would stay on the Canadian side so you don't have to bother to get a NY licence, PITA.  I would head straight to the bar. If you want to keep it simple, 3/4 oz jig head with 4"" white twister tail. Big lakers (check the seasons) galore and the odd brown and bow. Pipe line drift is good too.  Check the conditions before you make the trip. I remember one winter, there was only 2 fishable days all winter.  Like Pierre mentioned, even if the consumption guide says it's ok, I wouldn't eat anything from there. JMO."

947158,Mister G,2015-11-30 22:58:00,1429, A few questions if you don't mind Chris:  TIA! I'm not sure why Chris thinks getting a NYS license is a PITA......at least not anymore since one can be had via the internet in minutes.  Conditions on the lower river are just as important if not more then anywhere else......high north winds...STAY HOME....also if there have been a lot of heavy winds on Lake Erie for a while just before your trip will muddy up the river and kill the bite.  Other things you mentioned like rain or snow means just about nothing other then comfort problems for the anglers aboard.

I'm likely dating myself, but we would have to get up super early, drive across the border, buy the NY licence, then come back and fish. If it's available online now, not much of a pita.  Water clarity. If you want to fish the bar, wind strength and direction.  Pipeline = pumphouse drift, see Bob above  I would head straight to the bar because it's less technical and can be crazy good. I remember some days, 3 guys in the boat, with lots of triple headers of lakers all over 8 lbs, up to 15 lbs. And we just used heavy jigs, white twister tails. No shiners or slinkies or 3 way rigs."
947179,dave524,2015-11-30 23:54:00,4508,"As far as consumption, The Bows spent most of their lives in the same blue  zone as fish in the Credit or the Ganny, if you are fine with fish from those rivers don't worry about a fresh run Niagara fish."
947183,porkpie,2015-12-01 00:07:00,2521,"State license is easy.  Can be had online in no time.  The first time you set it up, you will have a bit of trouble with setup as a non resident.  Make sure you save your D.E.C.A.L.S number and it will make subsequent purchases a snap.  I always get a state license when fishing border waters.  There is nothing worse than watching guys across the line poking fish when your in a slow drift.  Have fun!"
947267,BillM,2015-12-01 12:52:00,17367,"Most of these guys are talking about fishing the drifts up in the river..   Fish the bar at the mouth, it's simple and painless.   I wouldn't bother trying to fish the runs near ArtPark if you've never done it before or you don't have someone experienced in the boat with you.  That river is no place to screw around."
947348,bassfighter,2015-12-01 19:10:00,366,"To fish the Niagara River US side, FLOAT SUIT is mandatory from Dec to April month.

One of my friend fish it all winter long, he said the toughest to do is boat control and to slow down the boat drift, one need a powerful trolling motor, so the lead weight will sit as vertically as possible to avoid less hang ups, Without a strong trolling motor, boat will just drift very fast off the Devils hole.

Now your friend might have some good incite on the lower river.  First a float suit is NOT mandatory on the NYS side, but rather you must wear a life jacket whenever the boat is under power from November 1st to May 1st.  Devils Hole area can get BUSY at times but I would not even suggest anyone who has never fished the lower river to even try that area as it can be intimidating at times and down right dangerous just getting up there.  I have fished many areas of the lower river without ever using my trolling motor......most times it really is not necessary depending on the wind of the day. Not having a TM should not discourage anyone from fishing the lower river.  I would not depend on satellite images to determine the water clarity of the lower river......as I said once before, the winds leading up to the day of your trip is what I would go by. Most guys that plan a trip leave before the sun is up and the satellite images at night are useless. And if it's a heavy north wind, just stay home because you cannot drift a northern flow river with northern wind. Not good drifting up river while you line is floating down river......talk about SNAGS ! ! !  A normal SW wind on Lake Erie will not effect your trip.....however, heavy winds for a day or two prior to your trip might kill the bite on the lower river.  You are correct about once Lake Erie freezes over the bite gets better because now you have constant clear waters to fish.  BTW for those recommending fishing the Niagara Bar rather then drifting the river.........that's OK and could be very good advise, however you will probably just catch lake trout on the bar that are not in season right now........but up the river near the launch are great drifts that will get you brown trout, some lakers and the most sought after fish....the STEELHEAD ! ! ! ..... now you're talking some fun action."

I believe a TM is a necessity. It will also allow u to fish a north wind if you have to by moving you down wind with your bait. And Devils Hole is not a big deal to run or fish if you are cautious, follow others' lead, a good boater and good on the TM. (Watch out for the very big boulders at the head of that pool!!!!!!) IF you do not have the skills - stay at artpark or Queenston or lower. And I agree with everything u said. U took his C+ answer and made it an A with your extra info."
