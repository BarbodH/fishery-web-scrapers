Been using optis for 10 years and never had issues with bad gas. Never had issues at all. Gas in boat tank doesn't last more then a week or two. I been using seafoam twice a month since spring and more since fall.  Motor runs great and is as clean as I have ever seen it.  That seafoam is good stuff."

The computer can't compensate so it will knock and ping, over a short time the power head will blow. The computer will store the info and any warranty will be voided.   Merc recommends lower octane fuel and highlights the importance of not using higher octane fuel.  What's wrong with  Seafoam?  It's a fantastic product and works better then anything I have tried. Quick clean cant even do what this stuff does.  You can eat off my exhaust ports.  Pls don't knock what you don't understand.  Thx Joe"
946082,irishfield,2015-11-24 03:24:00,26272,"No need to be cleaning something constantly if you're burning the amount of fuel you claim, especially in a timed fuel injected 2 stroke. Probably not even the need for stabil if you're going through that kind of fuel.  Must suck not being able to get gas at most marinas, since most have gone strictly to ethanol free premium to appease customers. Premium may burn slower, but it certainly isn't going to burn hotter if you aren't adding any extra air.  As for knocking what I don't understand, don't even go there.  BTW, you seem worried about voiding your warranty. I can guarantee there's a bigger chance of that happening running Seafoam than what the Opti is recommended to have added to it's fuel, being Quicksilver Quickleen. Fuel recommendation is 87 octane and Premium 92 is acceptable.  I think you need to find a new service tech that isn't so quick to brainwash while taking your money."

944791,captpierre,2015-11-15 01:17:00,2521,So did my usual winterizing of my 115 and put her to bed. Then took her out again with the nice fall weather. Didn't use the live wells. Do I need to re squirt fogging oil into the cylinders again and turn her over a bit? And do I need to pump more antifreeze into the front and back live well system after not turning pump on since winterizing with antifreeze. Feeling kinda lazy but want to do it right
944792,chris.brock,2015-11-15 01:20:00,4053,"By running it, the fogging you did a couple weeks ago is now useless.  edit- like Wayne and Mike I don't fog my 4 stroke either, always premium (no ethanol) gas, last tank with Stabil  I don't fog 2 strokes either, premium gas, Stabil, and a cap full of oil down the spark plug hole and pull it over a few times."
944793,Joeytier,2015-11-15 01:21:00,3990,"Well yes, if you have gas in the motor and fuel lines and no fogging oil, it's not winterized."
944794,irishfield,2015-11-15 01:34:00,26272,"Why I cap my livewell intake ports after winterizeing and as for fogging, unless you're storing beyond next summer, I wouldn't be bothered with fogging a 4 stroke. Quick check of your lower unit oil for water (pull lower plug.. look.. feel oil.. put back plug).

I still pour antifreeze in just in case, but it does seem kind of pointless.  Unless you can see the plumbing, there could be a low spot. Easy and cheap, I'd still pour in some antifreeze."
944799,captpierre,2015-11-15 02:01:00,2521,I've always wondered about the fogging oil. Seems only the bottom side of the cylinder gets the benefit after I squirt it in. Unlike the old 2 stroke where I sprayed it into the running carbs and drowned her. Using a funnel and hose I pour antifreeze into the rear live well intake and run the pump first to the front well. Then close the front well valve and open the rear valve. I doubt any water gas gone into the pump and plumbing after not running the pump since winterizing. But I'm not sure.
944801,irishfield,2015-11-15 02:05:00,26272,"IF you didn't cap that intake, then just putting the boat in the water refilled the pump and lines to the hull water line. Pending how your thru hull pump is mounted, and how the hoses go forward from it, they could hold some water. I know the way mine run that the boat ramp isn't steep enough to empty the hose running to the front live well. (why I cap them before fall Musky fishing)"
944803,cram,2015-11-15 02:23:00,1733," Unless you can see the plumbing, there could be a low spot. Easy and cheap, I'd still pour in some antifreeze. I can see the plumbing.  I pour it anyway in case there's something left in the intake pump.  Seems pointless, but you never know.  Edited my post."
944804,captpierre,2015-11-15 02:23:00,2521,It's a Lund and the rail slope  to the boathouse is pretty steep but I'll re winterizing the wells. Thanks.

945002,Mister G,2015-11-16 19:32:00,1429,Do you have a compressor. If so you could just blow out the lines with compressed air. I have been doing this for many many years without any problems. And I always fog my outboard before I put it away for the winter.
945021,wormdunker,2015-11-16 22:59:00,1711,Cheap insurance to fog the engine & pour some anti freeze into the water lines.  I do it every fall.
945023,Joeytier,2015-11-16 23:21:00,3990,Why not fog a 4stroke?  Seems like the heads and pistons would be just as susceptible to corrosion/rust as a 2stroke?
945025,Mister G,2015-11-16 23:36:00,1429,Why not fog a 4stroke?  Seems like the heads and pistons would be just as susceptible to corrosion/rust as a 2stroke? The theory behind not having to fog a 4 stroker is because the internal engine parts are already coated / protected with crankcase oil while a 2 stroker is not............but depending on the engine this could be a false pretense because of piston ring blow-by with fuel washing down the cylinder walls and thus your engine in not getting the protection it needs and you think you are getting.  Fogging a 4 stroke is still a good idea IMHO.......but do what you want because you are going to anyways....
945341,fishindevil,2015-11-19 09:12:00,6254,Well I have a four stroke 50hp 2011yamaha outboard and I was speaking with a few Yamaha marine mechanics about that issue to fog or not to fog ?? And they both said basically if it's not going to be stored longer than 6months that it will not need it ... Like Wayne said top it up with premium gas run top quality fuel stabilizer through it make sure water is all drained fresh oil up top & check gear case oil fill it with fresh oil and maybe a corrosion spray on everything and put it away !!!! I have done the above for several years and no issues
945348,Lape0019,2015-11-19 13:38:00,647,"My Mercury manual specifically states not to fog the engine. It is a fourtroke. It states if you want to add anything, add a little of the crankcase oil.  I don't fog, my marina recommends I don't do anything so All I do is change the oils and rund 91 (all of the time) with fuel stabilizer and quick kleen through her.  I do not bother with Antifreeze in my live well pumps either. But, I can see where my pumps are."
