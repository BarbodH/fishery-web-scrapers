I have a charger that I use for my car batteries.  I assume I can use it to charge the fishfinder battery.  Also do I use the charger on the 6V setting or 12V setting.  lastly, how long does it take to charge the battery completely?  Its the first time I'm dealing with a battery like this so sorry for the newb questions"

946985,NANUK,2015-11-29 16:43:00,797,"Most likely its 12v DC,  voltage and AH (Amp Hour) rating should be specified on the battery, some of them will even say the charge rate. As for the charging, Most of those batteries are around 7 to 12 AH (Amp Hour), Yours is most likely a 7.2 AH, Recommended charge rate for those batteries is 30 to 40% of their AH rating, Personally I don't go above 30%, An automatic charger @ 2 Amp setting should be good, nothing wrong with those 1 Amp chargers either, it will just take longer."

Your simple 120 volt plug in to 12 v DC power supply. Look around the house, your probably have one."
