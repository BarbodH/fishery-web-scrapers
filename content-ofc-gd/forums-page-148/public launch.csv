946696,cranke,2015-11-27 03:58:00,1,I read Lakeview launch is closed as of Nov. 19th is there a public launch anywhere near there still open?
946705,Chuck Enwinde,2015-11-27 06:13:00,247,Port Credit and Marie Curtis Park would be the closest.  They may pull the docks but I don't ever remember them closing the launch.
