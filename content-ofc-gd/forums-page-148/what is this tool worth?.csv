947159,huzzsaba,2015-11-30 23:02:00,884,I inherited this tool set.  it is some sort of ratchet set with a 1 inch socket head on it.  Any idea what this is worth? 
947163,aplumma,2015-11-30 23:17:00,6896,is there a brand name on it?  Art
947164,muddler,2015-11-30 23:25:00,623,"Looks like a ratchet that truckers would use or for heavy machinery. What make/manufacturer is it? I did a Google search and there's quite a few 1"" ratchets out there."
947166,huzzsaba,2015-11-30 23:25:00,884,I believe its Westlake or something of that sort. the ratchet is actually telescopic so it doubles in length.  I will check the name and report back.

Definitely seemed overpriced from the start but $150 used seems like a good ballpark figure from what Ive seen online."
