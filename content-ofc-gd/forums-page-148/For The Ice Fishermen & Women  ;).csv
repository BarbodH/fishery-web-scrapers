There's a great chart on wind chills in the paper too.  http://www.dot.gov.nt.ca/_live/documents/content/Ice%20Construction%20Field%20Guide%20web.pdf  FYI, this pic is what 5 foot of clear ice looks like.        According to the paper this ice with dry cracks should be down graded to 90% Luckily my ice fishing rigs weigh quite a bit less than 90,000 kg!!!!!"

Pike fishing on a crystal clear lake and the ice was so loud it sounded like thunder cracking right next to you every 25-30 seconds.  That was my excuse for not catching anything"
