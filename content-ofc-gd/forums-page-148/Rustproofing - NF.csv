946682,icefisherman,2015-11-27 01:23:00,952,"Guys,  Keep reading here about Krown, Rust check etc. People with various experience with one or the other... I'd suggest do yourself a favor, forget and stay away from both!  About a month ago faced with the same dilemma how to best protect my F150 I spent tons of time researching this issue.  The proven answer is Corrosion Free.  https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjn46642K_JAhXIGB4KHSDJCUQQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.corrosionfree.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNFplKN5qA-iNy_d2zH_U7L4w5y6IA&sig2=MrjCJnjK4vib-QlsOsd2KQ   - no drilling anything anywhere - not dripping anything - Tested and proven as best corrosion protection by no other but the Canadian Army ""Defense Research and Development Canada"". Actual report is here:http://cradpdf.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/PDFS/unc53/p526285.pdf  For those with no time to read summary and conclusions can be found here:  https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjjpaKysq_JAhULJB4KHZesDrgQFgg2MAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtosavemoney.ca%2Fwhich-rust-proofing-service-is-best&usg=AFQjCNFghirs2GC2v9z_HvVb6TMADGBl_w&sig2=nYbewth-oSStjvJKSY2DHA   - only need reapplication every 18 months (not every 12 like the others). Therefore much cheaper on the long run and cost you less time overall.  I used and can strongly recommend a guy in Mississauga...gave me super deal on the truck and spent close to 2 hrs spraying every single visible and invisible spot one can imagine....what a great service! As the guy said ""Why drilling holes if manufacturer provided enough of them, plugged but available if needed"". Krown and Rust Check are simply to lazy to open the rubber grommets one by one spray in all cavities and close them again...it takes time but this is the way to do it. As I said I watched in complete amazement how this guy climbed under, over and anywhere in between my truck but didn't leave a millimeter anywhere that was not sprayed. Not a drop on my driveway. No need to go ""drive on dusty roads crap"" etc ;-)  Really happy...will gladly do it again in 18 months.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
946683,Fisherman,2015-11-27 01:44:00,7201,Thanks for the info.
946685,ecmilley,2015-11-27 01:56:00,2163,"An 08, if rust is showing does rustproofing really help?  I have a Jeep Compass 07 and they have a problem I didn't know or was advised of. But then it was used when purchased in 2010. Manufactured won't even tell!  The AC hose is NOT long enough to drip condensation onto the pavement and it drops it on the frame which in time starts to rust! This was pointed out to me by my mechanic! I fixed that during my oil change. I have now extend the hose, but is it too late? Replacing the parts may run $2000 if needed.  Just a bad design for about 6 inches of hose!, I would look at this configuration on other cars, maybe the same. It's a free fix if you have some plastic hose, a clamp and screwdriver. sorry not really a short drain hose problem more of a cheap steel issue there is a recall/warranty on 2007 s for the rot problem for the front and rear subframes, call your local fca dealer for details, but ist 10 years i believe"
946691,NANUK,2015-11-27 03:11:00,797,"My wife's new vehicle didn't require any new holes drilled by Krown, There are enough access / holes in the newer vehicles. To say that Rust check and Krown dealers are too lazy to use the existing holes is Bull imo, what takes more time ? to drill new holes and then plug them or just use the existing holes ? On my pickup truck they even take the tail lights off to access certain areas, On the tail gate they weren't happy with reaching all the corners so they just drilled one hole. My truck is over 10 years old, I only take it for Krown rustproofing every other year now, still not a single spot of rust on it. You cant argue with 20 + years of personal experience with a product."
947034,Mister G,2015-11-30 01:20:00,1429,Don't waste your money.
947035,leaf4,2015-11-30 01:36:00,2466,"For what its worth at this point, my 2011 Tucson had/has diamond kote rustproofing on it when I purchased it, I go back for a yearly check up/respray that is free but the dealer did tell me it was $800 if it were me buying it as a new car, but since it was one of their employees cars it was carried over as it was technically the dealerships when I purchased, I like it. Its a yellow oil/grease and the underside of my vehicle is jet black through the use of the ""vulcanized undercoating"" whatever that is lol"
947215,fishdawg,2015-12-01 01:40:00,912,"Very happy with Krown as well. Anonymous her good thing to do in conjunction with rust proofing, is to rinse vehicle as often as possible of salt/sand. Very handy to know someone who has a car wash bay in condo parking lot...."
946495,cuzza,2015-11-25 22:59:00,467,"Afternoon all,  Just been out switching tyres and giving the car ('08 CRV) the once over and notice some rust underneath, nothing major, mostly on the subframes and suspensions arms and I'd like to nip it in the bud. Krown seems to be popular but I don't want holes drilled all over the place just the underside of the car done. If they spray inside the doors surely it gets on the seals and onto the windows?  Any suggestions? Will Krown just do the underside (I know, I should call them  ) - just wondering what options are out there.  Cheers,  Richard"
946496,misfish,2015-11-25 23:10:00,29133,  Where did you get your info?
946497,cuzza,2015-11-25 23:17:00,467,"Had a look on the Krown website Brian, it says they spray inside the doors and quarter-panels and it mentions drilling.  This is all new to me so excuse my ignorance"
946503,misfish,2015-11-25 23:42:00,29133,No worries  I use krown. Never had anything on my windows. Drilling is what they do to get the inhibitor (sp?) in your car. You have nothing to worry about.
946504,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-25 23:42:00,10439,You can have the underside oil sprayed. Plenty of places that do it. Doesn't protect the doors and other panels though.
946505,misfish,2015-11-25 23:44:00,29133,"You can have the underside oil sprayed. Plenty of places that do it. Doesn't protect the doors and other panels though.  Ya,and some of those under sprays are just garbaged used oil with tar added to it. LOOKS NICE FOR A FEW WEEKS."
946507,lew,2015-11-25 23:56:00,12766,"I don't want holes drilled all over the place  Once the liquid is sprayed inside the panels they insert plastic plugs into the holes and they don't look bad at all, nothing to worry about."
946510,captpierre,2015-11-26 00:22:00,2521,I use Krown too Very happy. As Lew said the plastic plugs they put in the holes look good. I hear going down a dusty gravel road after the spraying is a good idea. The dust sticks to the spray and slows down its loss. You can also buy a few cans of Krown or Rust Check and spray the underside yourself
946515,cuzza,2015-11-26 00:37:00,467,"Thanks guys, knew this was the right place to ask  - I'll give my local place a call and get it done"

946546,NANUK,2015-11-26 02:40:00,797,"I have been using Krown for the last 20 years, none of my vehicles have a spot of rust. They do drill some holes necessary to apply the product, but only what is required and cover them with plastic plugs. It does drip for a couple of days, but thats why it works so well by creeping in all the small cracks and crevices, One thing I noticed with Krown, it all depends on the franchise, most are really good and spray what and where it is needed and just the right amount, I know at least one in T.O area where they over spray on the parts where it does more bad than good. Overall, it is a very good product and it works really well. It is a good idea to spray your vehicle if it has started to show any sign of rust and you are planning to keep it for a long time, Krown will slow down or stop the process."
946564,Joeytier,2015-11-26 09:54:00,3990,"I have used both Krown and Rust Check, and I would very much recommend Krown in terms of quality of product, application and price.  Krown was cheaper, faster, application was more thorough (even cleaned up my engine bay, made it look brand new!) and I was able to watch them do the deed while I had a coffee.  Surface frame rust on an 08 is nothing to worry about, surprised you didn't get any sooner considering you haven't got it sprayed yet, but I would definitely start this year."
946578,Mike Pike,2015-11-26 14:06:00,1332,I too have used Krown for years now on several vehicles and am really satisfied.  Never had ANY rust issues for the life of my cars.
946579,porkpie,2015-11-26 14:10:00,2521,"I used to use crown, I now go to Howe and reeves in fergus.  I like the oil they put on, it's a no drip, but they practically disassemble your truck to apply it.  You can't go wrong with oil spraying your vehicle."
946581,moxie,2015-11-26 14:13:00,1566,No need to worry about the holes. Ive used Krown for a few years and find it works well. I prefer that it drip especially away from seams that love to hold salt and grit.  Have the truck done every other fall for $120 all in.
946583,DanD,2015-11-26 14:15:00,2223,"If your vehicle is still under warrantee, from the manufacturer; check with the dealer, so that you do not void the warrantee by applying an aftermarket rust protection.  Dan."
946584,lew,2015-11-26 14:17:00,12766,"If you have a pick-up truck with a drop-in bed liner they can sometimes  wear on the paint underneath which can lead to rust, but Krown actually sprays under the liner too to keep your truck bed from rusting."
946590,gogu392,2015-11-26 15:21:00,142,"Krown here for last 10+ years. Happy with the protection. I don't care about rain, snow or salt."
946607,tomkat,2015-11-26 17:44:00,246,My friend has a 1990 Ford Explorer from new. Known every year not a spec of rust. The thing looks like it should be in a museum. I just had my new f150 done I saw the brine trucks were out last week.
946610,captpierre,2015-11-26 18:05:00,2521,"Rust advances faster in the warm weather than in winter. I would respray rusty areas and potential problem areas in the spring also. Like bottom of doors, hood and trunk. With spray can."
946629,NANUK,2015-11-26 20:24:00,797,"Most rust start from inside out on painted panels & doors, spraying the paint outside is not going to help much."
946631,hutch4113,2015-11-26 20:42:00,374,"Just so you are aware, the guys at Krown go through some pretty intensive training, on how to drill as little as possible (not the line guys, but the owner/operator usually and/or who is selected from the shop).  They are trained on the in's/out's of vehicles - where the best spot to drill is - and then based on feedback from owners and franchise owners, will adjust.  (Full reveal - My Brother Inlaw owns a Krown).  So while there is some drilling - it is usually pretty minimal - and as others chime in, has little impact to the car itself."
946661,John Bacon,2015-11-26 23:46:00,3277,"Does anybody have experience with the electronic rust inhibitors?  That is what Toyota uses for their rust protection now.  If a vehicle had an electronic rust inhibitor, would getting it sprayed add to the protection?  Or, could the spray actually interfere with the electronic equipment."
946669,irishfield,2015-11-27 00:09:00,26272,It would void the warrantee. I bit my lip while Moffit Madza sold my youngest on exactly this (for $800 bucks including a paint sealer / polish) on her new 2016 x CX3 AWD that we picked up last week.

From what I understand those electronic devices are junk, more of a gimmick than anything, and are not recommended at all.  Cheers"
