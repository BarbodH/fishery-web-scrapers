946035,Beans,2015-11-23 22:44:00,3339,I haven't used PhotoBucket for ages ever since they got into the telemarketing business via e-mail...  I find using the built-in OFC photo poster easy to use as long. as I enable HTML

946130,Headhunter,2015-11-24 14:48:00,5703,"As mentioned, open a Photobucket account Derek. You up-load your pics to the site and once up-loaded, click on the image to open it, then click on the ""img"" tag. That will copy the image location. Just right click with your cursor in the OFCN open box with your text and you are done. HH"

946438,Headhunter,2015-11-25 18:35:00,5703,"thanks Joe even I could handle that    Now that is one good lookin pup! My brother has a dog that is blacker than black... how much more black could it be, none more black! It's really difficult to get a good pic of that dog, the all black seems to melt into a blob of black, this one above is really good! HH"
946439,BillM,2015-11-25 18:36:00,17367,I wasn't complaining about Photobucket's picture posting just about the damn e-mails they keep sending to purchase crap...  At the bottom of one of those emails should be an 'Unsubscribe' link...  Click it and you shouldn't receive anymore emails from them.
