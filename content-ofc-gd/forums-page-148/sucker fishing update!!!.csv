945837,huzzsaba,2015-11-21 23:10:00,884,"Ive never been sucker fishing.  Just curious, are they similar to carp?  And are they easier to catch duing certain times of the year? Perhaps this time of the year since you were out trying to find them."

Changing times? The spring sucker run seemed like it was a bigger deal years ago? My grandparents on my mom's side were Czech, and my dad was a depression era kid, they used to cook suckers or pickle them like herring?  Of course when I was young a lot of people in the neighborhood had pigeon coops, and not for sending messages! Squab! It tastes just like chicken? LOL"
945844,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-21 23:51:00,956,There everywhere on the grand bud.  Just find a deep pocket and throw a worm with a couple of split shots and just wait.  I use google maps to find the deep pockets.
945976,huzzsaba,2015-11-22 23:34:00,884,I believe this is a Sucker.  Please correct me if I'm wrong. it was swimming pretty close to shore when I took the photo last month.

945982,captpierre,2015-11-23 01:56:00,2521,I remember one of my old farm clients saying  as a kid he used to fork them out of the Rouge River in the spring. Then walk thru Markham and sell them to town folks out of a wheel barrow.
947364,huzzsaba,2015-12-01 21:45:00,884,"just curious, do the bigger size suckers stay in the rivers and creeks this time of the year? or do they head back to the lake?  I'm asking because I would like to fish a part of the river that is closed to salmon and trout at this time but open to whatever else is available excluding bass of course.  I would head to that spot if there is a possibility of hooking into a sucker but if its all trout, Id rather stay away"

That's not a typical common white sucker but a less common Black Redhorse sucker. Could be on rare species list. Sucker fishing excitement!   haha
