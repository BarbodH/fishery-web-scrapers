367977,mttbender,2009-07-30 13:07:00,1,I am looking for a good kid friendly place to take my 4 year old fishing.  No boat just off shore or dock etc.  He is just learning to cast so I need somewhere that is not too congested.  I am in the Woodstock area.  If any one has any suggestions that would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks
