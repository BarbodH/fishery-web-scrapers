368183,Gerritt,2009-07-30 23:22:00,6129,fishing is TOUGH there.... but there are Bass and Hammer handles in there... if you want a bit more then shore fishing there are canoe rentals available.
368193,Bob,2009-07-30 23:55:00,370,Yep!  What Gerritt said.  Drive right past the park gate and another 1/2 hour will put you in the heart of the Pickerel River system.
