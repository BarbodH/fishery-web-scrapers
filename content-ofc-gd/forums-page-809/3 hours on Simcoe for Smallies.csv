367694,Cudz,2009-07-29 18:34:00,2652,"Went out seaching for some smallies this morning with my Spanish foreign exchange student.  We didn't get out on the water until 9am but managed a fish right away.  Small but hopefully a sign of things to come.  My student was having difficulty casting the smaller crankbaits so I decided to let him use a 1/2 ounce Lucky craft shallow crankbait ($20, I was actually thinking is this a good idea?).  Anyway he did manage to cast it a bit further and eventually hooked into a nice fish.  As he is fighting the fish (in his own style) all I am thinking is please let the 8 pound mono hold!  I net the fish and indeed it was a good fish.  I weighed 4.1 pounds. He was well happy.  We continued to fish an managed a bunch of clone smallies.  All about the same size and he closed out the day with the final fish, a nice 2 pounder.  Although it was a bit wet and windy this morning it was still loads of fun as we managed about 10 smallmouth and a bunch of perch. The kid still has a smile on his face.  First fish of the day  Another small one  clone fish  and yet another clone  The exchange student's 4.10 pounder "

367966,Cudz,2009-07-30 12:19:00,2652,Hey snagmasteral they are just starting to be where they are supposed to be.  Size is still down that is true but numbers are improving.  I think the rain and cold have messed them up a bit.  Hopefully next week.  I always look forward to your posts.
