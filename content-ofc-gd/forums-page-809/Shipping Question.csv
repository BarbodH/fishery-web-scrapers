The final quote online for both items included the GST but no PST because they are being shipped out of BC.  Will I have to pay PST here in Ontario when I pick them up at the Post Office or when it shows up by courier???  Or am I only going to have to pay GST???  Anybody know?  If I only pay GST, it will be cheaper for me to have them shipped to my door (they waived shipping fee for me) than to drive to BPS and pay both taxes.  Thanks  Paul"

367862,John Bacon,2009-07-30 02:31:00,3277,As long as the business does not have an Ontario location they do not have to charge PST for shipments into Ontario.  I would assume that the B.C. shop does not have an Ontario location; so you should be fine.
