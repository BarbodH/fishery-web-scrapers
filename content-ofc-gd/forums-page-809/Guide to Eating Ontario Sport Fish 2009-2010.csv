The format of the 2009-2010 Guide is unchanged from the previous 2007-08 edition. However, there are many changes in the advisory tables reflecting updated guidelines for some contaminants as well as the incorporation of approximately 120,000 test results performed on about 12,000 fish. The advisories continue to be based on health protection guidelines provided by the Food Directorate of Health Canada. Since 2005, advisories have been provided separately for the general population and for the sensitive population of women of child-bearing age and children under 15.
