This stop was at Rice Lake.  Rice and I.... we dont really see eye to eye.  If I could fight Rice Lake, I'd totally do it.  Nonetheless, I had to fish it.  I've only been there 3 times, where everyone else in the tourney fish it like every weekend lol.  Fishin for points here.  Started off alright with a 2 pounder on the 3rd cast, then struggled hard the rest of the day.  Managed one almost 4 pounds on the jig. Fished our butts off for 10.4 pounds and finished 8th.  Frustrating, but cant wait for Balsam and Simcoe next on our list!    I needed to catch some fish and get my confidence back up.  My cousin Brent has a Junior Bassmasters tournament coming up on Bass Lake in a couple weeks, so I figured we'd go out there, I'd catch lots of fish and teach him a thing or two.  It worked, and it felt nice.  We caught about 30 fish in 4 hours.  No tanks, but lots of solid fish.  Here's to hoping he can get em in a couple weeks time.  All fish on senkos and flippin craws.    Today, I fished a club tournament on Lake Eugenia.  The water temp is still only 71 degrees, and I'm having a hard time figuring the fish out on some of these lakes.  I'm catching fish, but not consistant big fish.  Not tournament winners.  My non-boater smashed them on the dropshot, and I flipped my way to a dissapointing day.  Swung for the fences and struck out... kinda.  I won big fish prize for the tourney, but the rest of my bag sucked.  Lucky he played it safe and kept us in the running for a 3rd place finish.  My fish came on a 5 inch craw flipping to wood and weeds in 4-12 feet of water.  HE fished a ring fry on a dropshot in the deeper water.      I have been humbled the past couple weeks, and I seek redemption!!!  Stay tuned."
