There seems to be very limited information on what fish are actually available in the lake other than the fishing regulations summary.  Any luck with Trout / Walleye or Pike.  Any luck using down riggers in this lake?  Thanks in advance,"
368090,steverowbotham,2009-07-30 19:18:00,1800,"no trout in six mile.  bass are very common, walleye and pike are present but not in the numbers of surrounding lakes"

Lots of pike and bass, for walleye you really have to know the humps and shoals. There are big gar, pannies, etc... as well.  There were trout once, but not since the mid 70's."
