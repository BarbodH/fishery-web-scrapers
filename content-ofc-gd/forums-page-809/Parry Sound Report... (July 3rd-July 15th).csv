Main reason I didn't post because I didn't take pictures of any of the fish that were worth posting. So heres the summary :  Packed up the family and headed to the cottage in Parry Sound, a beautiful 10 acre island on Georgian Bay; Victoria Island to be precise. Over the entire trip which stretched from July 3rd to July 15th we only got a couple complete rain out days! The water was nice to swim and everyone had a good time....  Now for the fishing. Majority of my fishing was done around the island off the shore, occasionally I got out on the canoe so I could cast into the spots blocked off by trees and what not. Caught more small mouth than I can possibly count. Nothing too huge but all were exciting! I have no stats on the fish because all I went up there with was a $20 dollar rod and reel set from Wal-Mart with some live worms! No scales for weighing the fish...I guess I could of brought a measuring tape...anyways I'm rambling now. Needless to say thats why there aren't many pictures, because I didn't think I was going to get ""hooked"" and take up fishing as my primary hobby.  The few pictures I have (below) are from the front of the island where the kids hung out, so there was someone around taking pictures here and there...   We did go out on the lund several times, I am still waiting for my brother-in-law to text me the picture of my first Pike! Boy was that a thrill bringing that in. Nothing huge at all, but much bigger than any of the fish I was catching off the island. I will post that once he sends it in. He's currently working in the islands doing cottage cleanup, what a neat little company! Anyways, I guess that ends up my report! I can't wait to go back!   Decent size small mouth :    Tons of little small mouth off the dock, pretty much guaranteed a fish every other cast :    And lots of these guys + rockies...someone thought they were funny and would take a pic of me: "
