367899,Skud,2009-07-30 03:03:00,739,My 100th post is a sad one.   I am puting my boat up for sale. I need some extra coin to fix up the house so we can move up a notch. My family of six is getting tight in a 1200sqf semi. Looks like I will be fishing from my Dads 14' tinny for a while. It's posted in the Classifieds.

367979,Beans,2009-07-30 13:15:00,3339,I've heard of doing yourself out of a place at the table but never out of a boat...
367980,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-30 13:17:00,2050,"Sorry to hear dude, but glad to see you're looking out for what's in the best interest for your family.  The good carma will reward you with great days on the water, and a bigger badder rig some day!  Cheers, Ryan"
367997,blaque,2009-07-30 14:06:00,2419,Yeah but the kids would probably appreciate time on the water much more than their own room lol  My nephew would have a FIT if i ever got rid of the boat. lol
368008,Spiel,2009-07-30 14:35:00,9065,"I feel for you Doug, I'm sure it was a tough decision. Great boat for somebody though and I do remember driving her that one time at Dalrymple. It was in part the reason I started looking for my own Lund."
368024,crappieperchhunter,2009-07-30 15:46:00,2582, Gotta agree with the above statement. Lotsa large farm families where I grew up. Most of my friends never had there own private bedrooms. Big families always manage...and its a good life lesson taught early...showing the younguns how to live within your means.  Not tryin to preach to the choir here....cause you gotta do what's best for you and yours.  Good luck with whatever road you take.
368033,LeXXington,2009-07-30 16:37:00,1928,"She was a good boat, I remember fishing beside you for Perch. With Muskybill  Kids today, think there own room is a right!! haha I did not get my own room til my older sister eventually moved out.  Oh well I feel for ya"
368085,blaque,2009-07-30 19:10:00,2419,Have we talked you out of it yet Skud LOL!    Dont forget garages and basements make for great sleeping quarters hehe
368106,TC1OZ,2009-07-30 20:04:00,987,Just build the enclosure on the boat and make the kids think they are special when its their month to sleep in the boat !
368109,Dara,2009-07-30 20:10:00,3052,You couldn't have made that decision 2 months ago eh
368111,misfish,2009-07-30 20:23:00,29133,  I was just thinking the same thing.LOL  Sorry to hear yer letting her go bud.
368191,Skud,2009-07-30 23:50:00,739,"Everyone has very good points on the matter. I am not loving the decision. I will see what happens.  And yes, one day when I buy another boat it is going to be a beauty."
368328,MuskyBill,2009-07-31 04:46:00,311,"I remember that day too, Paul...  Sorry to hear, Skud, but you know what's best. Dang, I wish I had some spare coin, she's a beauty vessel for sure."
