367077,singingdog,2009-07-28 09:35:00,1047,"There are lakers there, but catching them from shore this time of year is about as likely as getting a date with a super-model  Decent bass in that lake, mostly smallmouth. Jerkbaits, jigheads with plastics and a couple of good topwaters will probably do it for you."
367087,eze76,2009-07-28 11:08:00,70,"Like i cant get a date with a super model ? HAHAH  But thanks , im just gunna try to atleast catch something , doesnt matter what it is , Cept a cold i dont want that or swine flu lol"
367092,bigugli,2009-07-28 11:20:00,6138,"Haliburtons in August eh? Crayfish. If it looks like, swims like, tastes like, a crayfish, that's the ticket.  There is also the tube."
367096,eze76,2009-07-28 11:34:00,70,"So would berkley gulp crawfish wrk , whats the diff between crawfish and crayfish lol?  i have like rubber crayfish things(noob) but they dont have a scent"
367099,bigugli,2009-07-28 11:43:00,6138,"Same thing, just depends if yer Americain or Canajun  The rubber cray will work. If you want put some liquid attractant on it.  Rebel crayfish crankbaits are great if you can get them bouncing off the bottom during the retrieve."
367186,camillj,2009-07-28 16:00:00,1988,"I caught a 44"" Musky right under someones dock (Johnsons silver minnow with double yellow mister-twister)... while he was standing there telling me that he's been a cottager there for 30 years and never caught a thing ....it was sweet ... next day that whole shore had people fishing off their docks  Good luck .. and dont forget your camera"
367320,GBW,2009-07-28 20:37:00,8460,go to the Le Baron's out there in mississuga and get some of the spray on sents.  I like the YUM LPT ones for $5 it's not that bad. Get some of these : Shakey Jig and rig it with a fake worm (like these) : YUM Dinger rig it and fish it like this : use braided line for sure as well. good luck
367528,eze76,2009-07-29 05:00:00,70," Oh dont wrry i wont forget my camera lol .   Ill pick up some stuff before i go thanks GBW, and everyone else"
367537,singingdog,2009-07-29 09:27:00,1047,save yourself some $ and skip the spray on scents....I don't think it makes a bit of difference to the bass.
367543,eze76,2009-07-29 11:25:00,70,"Alrighty, thanks , everythng else i should be getting , that was the only thing i was thinking about haven't made a decision yet.   Ez."
367642,lookinforwalleye,2009-07-29 16:07:00,4399,Some good rain gear!!!  I second the Shakey jigs they worked well on Limerick last year and smallies love Senko`s  Have fun.
367754,GBW,2009-07-29 21:34:00,8460,"  If you are a smoker, use the spray to help cover the smoke sent on your hands.  I have noticed a diff. the the total of fish at the end of the day and I smoke.  It's only $5, so it's less then 1/2 a pack of smokes...    But that's just me..."
367912,eze76,2009-07-30 03:24:00,70,"Haha , ye i dont smoke , but if i have some extra cash when i go up to stock up ill pick up some scent"
367915,GBW,2009-07-30 03:30:00,8460,"you can use it or not.  I just find it helps smokers like me mask the sent we leave on the bait from our hands.  it's not a be all end all thing but it does help i find looking at the # of fish the days i use it vs. the days i don't.  to each thier own at the end of the day, this is just my 2 cents, not sents..."
367916,GBW,2009-07-30 03:33:00,8460,"PS, the 25 1/4"" walleye 2 weekends ago was with sent.  i had no action until I uesed the garlic sent then 4 fish in less then 30 min.  maybe it was luck but I'm ""hooked"" on sents now..."
