Swipe and a miss.... waited about 10 seconds and twitched the line slightly...  KAPOW !   I think it weighed about 3 or 4 lbs... was 19"" long though. ( better get a weigh scale soon... geesh, how much more gear do I REALLY need? lol) I coulda stuffed a softball down its mouth..    I had to use the camera on my Blackberry for these... as my regular camera was ""buzzing"" when i tried to use it... musta got wet the other day when I had some good fishing too   I was fishing the shaded side of the lake....and close to shore ( maybe 20 feet off shore when it hit)  Stayed for an hour longer and had three more ""swipe and a miss""  Good way to start my day today.

368144,Burning Babies,2009-07-30 21:45:00,150,"Looks like you're getting your system down.  Very nice bass.  Most of the summertime 19""ers I've caught have been in the low to mid 3 lb range, but they are usually much thinner than yours.  As thick as that fish is, I'd bet it's just under 4."
368151,splashhopper,2009-07-30 22:00:00,2931,"I can't say enough about these ""scum frogs"" for top water bass...  So far, I have caught fish on the black / white / and Glow in the dark colours..  The bodies on these are pretty soft, so I think the fish can actually CHOMP it pretty good, which ""almost"" means a hook-set IF I wait until i FEEL it on the line...  This type of fishing has opened up a whole new world of fishing to this ""boat-less"" fisherman.... I have been following the topics on the board here for people looking at buying their first boat..  This fall should see some good deals on small boat/motor /trailer combos in my ""starter"" price range.  The only concern I have right now about this bass fishing is how hard I am setting the hook versus trout fishing this fall  thanks for all the support on here everyone...  Splashhopper"
