367962,splashhopper,2009-07-30 11:59:00,2931,I think I just saw an ad on TV about a BIG FINE for fishing within a 1000 yards of a Hydro Dam in Ontario.  I can't seem to find any info on this in the regs...  Does anyone know?  And are there restrictions of fishing the outflows from Nuclear plants on the Great Lakes(Ontario) as well ?  Thanks  Splashhopper
