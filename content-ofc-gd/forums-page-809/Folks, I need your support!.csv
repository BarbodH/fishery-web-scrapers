366268,Rattletrap2,2009-07-26 02:01:00,1652,"Geez, Now I am being called a ""cheater"" by someone because I asked for support from you folks. Unreal!  Some of the contestants in the top 5 are using radio, television, message board forums (that they appear to have joined just for this contest!), bike forums, and a whole host of recruiters of votes!  All I have done is ask for support from a group of you people on OFC that I have considered friends for many years. This truly is a family here and we always go the extra mile for each other. This is clearly within the rules. WFN tells you to use Facebook, Myspace, emails, etc. to promote yourself.  We have to keep voting as much as we can! I'm afraid there is going to be a massive push towards the last couple of days to move people up and I could get bumped from the top 10. My wife and Daughters have put a lot into this for me and I would really like to have at least a chance at being looked at by the panel of judges.  Thanks, Brian"
366275,danbouck,2009-07-26 02:16:00,4380,  Don't worry about it. We should be able to get you into 1st. Maybe have a draw on here. Everybody who votes has a chance to win something  Like maybe a subway gift card...hint hint. I will be adding 10 daily anyway
366418,Terry,2009-07-26 17:25:00,14456,they are just upset they can use OFC  you have been here for years and years and you are asking friend s to help and we are
366422,Leecher,2009-07-26 18:04:00,7832,Here we go!!!
366426,jr7roo,2009-07-26 18:14:00,14,People talk about others when they are jealous or don't have nothing good to say. In this case they are talking about you Brian because you have such a Great support of Family and Friends and they are worried you are going to WIN this Contests.. GOOD LUCK LETS GO OFC Support our Member!!!!  10 more Votes.

366453,Rattletrap2,2009-07-26 19:42:00,1652,"Thanks Dan, Terry, and jr7roo! I have no idea where this coward is coming from, but I doubt he is from ONTARIO, and he certainly does not know me! Having a pond in your backyard does not mean you are financially well off. It means you are 50 years old and have been working (and will continue working for many years to come!)your butt off for 33 years to try and have a place that we can enjoy. The banks do have lots of money...all you have to do is ask for some!  As for transferring fish... they were here when we moved here with the exception of a few Goldfish and some Largemouth fry that I purchased from a fish farm. Otherwise, the fish are reproducing and doing well.  ""Charlie"" does not seem to mind the Alberta girls using TV, radio, message boards, newspapers and other methods, so my guess is he must be from there?"
366460,Terry,2009-07-26 19:55:00,14456,yeah I will bet he is not who or where is says he is from if they can't win fair they bad mouth the others.......

This would easily keep us up there. The other contestants have the support of various Calgary based fishing forums and message boards working for them for example.  I think this board has the power to surpass all of them with the huge member base here.  They allow any and all e-mail addresses to vote and about 8 to 10 from each IP address within about 24 hours. Please use family, friends, and co-workers e-mail addresses to vote with."

I have been a board member since the early days and my Daughter's have entered me in a contest on WFN to be adopted.  I could sure use your support to move my standings up some! I am in 17th place with a long way to go. You can vote everyday with your e-mail addresses and we have a month to go!  Please do what you can to help me out.  Thanks  http://www.wfn.tv/adopt/view.php?entry=360"
