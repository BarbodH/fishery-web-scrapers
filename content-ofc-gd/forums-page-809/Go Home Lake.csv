367914,ciceri,2009-07-30 03:30:00,535," I've only ridden my sled there in the winter, it's a beautiful lake. My buddy's have a cottage there, apparently theres some falls that hold fish, pretty sure theres lake trout too. I'm sure someone will give you better advice, to me it looks like an easy lake to fish."
368047,Rizzo,2009-07-30 17:21:00,4754,Very busy lake with cottagers/personal watercraft. we always did well for smallies and eyes if you can find a quiet place or time of day. I never caught any pike there
368075,skdds,2009-07-30 18:43:00,195,Great I'm sure it will be nice and quiet on the long weekend!
