As he stood there he noticed that   some souls were allowed to march right through the pearly gates into Heaven.    Others though, were led over to Satan who threw them into the burning   pit.  But every so often, instead of hurling a poor soul into the fire,   Satan would toss a soul off to one side into a small pile.  After watching Satan do this several times, the   fellow's curiosity got the best of him. So he strolled over and asked Satan   what he was doing. ""Excuse me, Mr. Prince of Darkness,"" he said.   ""I'm waiting in line for judgment, but I couldn't help wondering, why   are you tossing those people aside instead of flinging them into the Fires of   Hell with the others?""  ""Ah, those,"" Satan said with a groan.   ""They're all from Ontario..................   They're still too wet to burn.""     Maybe its not that funny...."
