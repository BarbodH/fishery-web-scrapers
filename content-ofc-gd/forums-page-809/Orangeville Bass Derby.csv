366829,Rattletrap2,2009-07-27 17:31:00,1652,"Those are impressive numbers for that little lake! For the Bass to be over 4 lbs. and only 19"" long, it must have been a football! Usually they would not get to that weight until they were around 22 to 23"". Every inch means a big difference with Bass in most cases.  Pretty tight numbers for the 1st through 3rd. place Bass though."
366834,spinnerbaitking,2009-07-27 17:37:00,1622,"Was it a good turn out or just plain nuts with people, I would be interested in that Tourney if they do it again, I went their a few times when they had the Pike Tourney there years ago & it was a good time even though we never won any thing Richard"
366993,johnnyb,2009-07-28 02:00:00,3413,Very interesting...I knew the top 3 bass would be close to each other...but wow! That's tight!
367323,Jon,2009-07-28 20:47:00,209,"I think aroun 200 people registered.  It was busy around the launch but not too bad on the water.  Fishing was slower on Sunday with cooler weather, pressured fish and anglers knowing what they needed to win.  Jon"
