367654,tambo,2009-07-29 16:42:00,85,"i remember my first and last trip to cuba, ,second night smoked so many cohibas and drank so much rum i got stinky drunk and though i was Borat,......never puked so much in my life"
367656,Rich,2009-07-29 16:45:00,3927,Had a couple cubans my parents brought back from Cuba.. they were great cigars. Worth paying insane money for? I don't think so.. just as happy with a Perfecto once in a while!
367663,blaque,2009-07-29 17:31:00,2419,i gotta try one of these things one of these days. lol
367667,diggyj,2009-07-29 17:42:00,548,"The Indians on Hwy#45 heading up to Rice Lake sell real Cubans, very cheap to.  Also you can try a Macanudo Robust, awsome smoke. Cuban quaility.  Or if you can swing by the Durham region, I can sell you a box of brand new, fresh, unopend, Monte Cristo's.  Dirk"
367743,Peps,2009-07-29 20:43:00,191,if your crossing in Windsor there are a few good stores CK Havana on Huron St. or if your going north of Toronto stop in woodbridge Boss Cigar Store HWY 7 & 27.    peps
367821,ironstone74,2009-07-30 00:54:00,201," Good point.  You need to have smoked some nasty cheap cigars to appreciate a smooth well humidifed Cuban cigar.  They hang and age the tobacco for months until it is rolled by a master roller, 3 to 4 different types of leaves are used, they are organized in the box by shade of colour (they have a guide listing over 100 shades of wrapper leaves ... What is the big deal??? Eat a nice meal, not too much garlic or onion it stains your taste buds, soften your pallet with a couple beers or glasses of wine, sit on your deck pour a glass of Port, single malt Scotch, or Cognac, cut the cap off the Cuban with a cutter, and spark it up!!!  A perfect way to spend an hour with friends and family  Cheap cigars are like fishing with a Snoopy rod and reel compared to a Stradic on a Loomis.... there is no comparison,  they are not similar.  Don't get me started, I love good cigars.  Paul"
367828,smally21,2009-07-30 01:21:00,993,im surprised at the selection of grocery store cigars.  larger chain stores like fortinos and yigs will have a tobacconist with a giant humidor that ontario law no longer allows you to go in but some nice fellow will bring them out to you. maybe easier to find than a smaller private shop. your lungs will thank me! good luck and happy smoking.
367829,grinandbearit30,2009-07-30 01:23:00,50,Anyone  check out the Correnti website..I assume that the prices are per cigar...Oh and ill try the el presidente!
367857,pike slayer,2009-07-30 02:24:00,1177,"ya the cigar store in romes is called holy smokes and the place is pretty sweet! they sell everything from cheap 50cent ones to $200 cigars, have in mind what you want cause they dont always let ppl in, they just ask what you want and they bring it out to you, to many ppl stealing cigars. thats pretty well the only place in town and if you want a good variety of cheap cigars like caption blacks and bullseye cigarellos and what not go to the trading post heading out north on the way out of town."
367877,backbay,2009-07-30 02:39:00,773,"You have to try it once if you want to learn about cigars. Not the cheapest, but the best quality you can buy, a match for any of the big names. Senor Correnti is worth a visit, I assure you."
367887,Jonny,2009-07-30 02:47:00,1380," Well scotch tastes like crap; does that mean Cuban = crap?  To quote the proverbial expression, ""I don't know art but I know what I like!"""
368086,aplumma,2009-07-30 19:12:00,6896,If you want a good supplier in the USA their is a site called jrcigar.com. They have great prices and alot of brands that I find are better than the Cuban cigars. The Cuban cigars were the top at one time but with the seeds getting out and the climates that are so close to them the wrappers and fillers are just as good from either the Honduras or  Equidor. If you want a friend for life get him a few onyx #4 reserve they are about $3.50 a stick and will make him a friend for life. I am not sure if they ship to Canada but if they do give them a holler.   Art
368120,PikeMolester,2009-07-30 20:44:00,428,Loblaws has a smokeshop no? Here in Quebec they do. Many nice cigars
368130,GBW,2009-07-30 21:09:00,8460,"Yeah, but you Quebec folks can go to one store and get your food, beer/booze, smokes and even gas (at some locations) where as in ONT we have to plan our day with list's and map's to get that all done.  Ahhh, Cohiba's oh how I miss them..."
368141,JohnF,2009-07-30 21:37:00,3494," We can do that at Zehr's if we're satisfied with wine instead of beer. But then I can just drive out of the gas bar over to the beer store without going onto the road so that's almost as good, isn't it?  JF"
368163,Jonny,2009-07-30 22:32:00,1380," Ahhh, would that were true. There are times when you'd like to buy some beer in odd places at odd hours and you can't because corner stores aren't allowed to stock it.  I'd love to be able to pick up a case at a Mac's Milk.  Plus I'm sure it would be a boon to those who don't own a car."
368195,JohnF,2009-07-30 23:58:00,3494, My wife would say it's too readily available now for her liking.  JF
368228,CLofchik,2009-07-31 01:26:00,854," Never a big fan of Cohiba's, if there's one brand of Cuban's that are far too overhyped it's them.  Their quality has gone really downhill, there's one or two duds in every box.  Their Robusto's & Esplendido's aren't bad, I think their best rollers are reserved for them.  Others, I'd rather smoke Honduran Hoyo's.  Now if you want a REAL smoke, Cuban Hoyo double corona's........still by far my fav smoke.   It's not just the aging, Cuba is the only place that gives the leaves a special secret water bath during aging.  It's very labour intensive, and even places like Honduras & Dominican the specialized labour that it takes is just too costly compared to Cuba.  Woot for exploited labour producing exquisite craftmanship!   +1 for JR, the best selection & prices for a known distributor.  Unfortunately it's illegal to mail tobacco or alcohol in the Socialist Police State Of Canuckistan, either mail it to a box in the US or if going on a trip have your order mailed to your hotel."
368233,Jonny,2009-07-31 01:34:00,1380, I assume that's tongue-in-cheek but that's the attitude that keeps Ontario from more convenient beer retailing.
368245,CLofchik,2009-07-31 01:53:00,854, I think the unionized commies that tell me at 4:45 the liquor store is closed might have something to do with it too.
367555,doack,2009-07-29 12:08:00,46,"One of the guys heading up with us on the 8th is a cigar smoker.  Trying to figure out where to buy them, he is looking for decent cigars, maybe a cuban or two.  Do they sell them at stores like the beer store, or are they sold at independent shops around the area?  Going through Saulte ste marie, so ideas there would be appreciated."
367557,johnnyb,2009-07-29 12:12:00,3413,"I don't think I've ever seen them at the beer store....but there's lots of independent stores that sell them.  I'm not sure where your journey begins, but there's a great little shop in Oakville on Cross Ave....all kinds of stuff in there and they'll help you pick out good ones"
367559,doack,2009-07-29 12:19:00,46," Is Oakville on Cross Ave in the soo?  I have no idea where to buy them, sounds like there are cigar stores though which is good news.  Thanks for reply, and if you can let me know if that is in the soo, that would be great."
367564,Jonny,2009-07-29 12:29:00,1380,"I'm not sure about the Soo area, but if all else fails look for native smoke shops (on reserve land). Some of them here in the North Bay area sell cigars (Cubans too) at good prices. I think you just might find the same around the Soo."
367566,JohnF,2009-07-29 12:40:00,3494," If yer coming out of the States, check at Duty Free. I'm pretty sure I've seen them there on return trips.  Otherwise, if all else fails, watch for a ritzy looking golf course and check at the pro shop. Golf courses are one of the last bastions for cigar smokers and some shops keep a humidor with cubans on hand.  JF"
367567,blaque,2009-07-29 12:42:00,2419,"Have him stock up where he usually buyz them before he leaves and buy a portable humidore to take along.  What is the big hoopla with these cuban cigars anyway, seriously ?"
367568,Dara,2009-07-29 12:43:00,3052,"I don't know where you are coming from, but when you say UP, I think from the US. If so, they have cigars at the duty free store as you cross the border. Otherwise there are a couple smoke shops downtown on Queen street. You really should cruise down that way to get a look at the waterfront as you pass through anyway. Where ya going...and coming from?"
367569,JohnF,2009-07-29 12:45:00,3494, I'm with you. I've never had a Cuban yet that I didn't think was over-priced by about 300%.  But then what do I know? I always thought House of Lords were pretty good tasting cigars.  JF
367573,doack,2009-07-29 12:50:00,46," Hey Dara, I have talked to you in past about drive to lakes up there in chapleau area for the kids and me.  We are coming over from Michigan, and the cigars in the duty free are usually junk and only a couple of types.  We are headed to Chapleau, and flying out on Sunday morning.  I will look for Queen Street when we get there, any suggestions on the store, or are they pretty much the same?  Is Queen Street on the route to 128, or 17 north?  Regardless, it sounds like we should be in business to get him his fix!  And for the guy that asked why cubans?  Who knows, probably because we can't get them in US is why, I don't know, you always want what you can't have right?  LOL..."
367576,Dara,2009-07-29 13:17:00,3052,"I gotta check a bit closer here. I looked in the phone book and don't see them listed any more.  We also have some major road closures here.  When you get off the bridge, turn right, thru the lights, and follow Bay st along past the Casino and  mall. It curves left at the end, then right. Normally you would turn left at the next lights, Pim St. Don't. Go straight down for 2 more sets of lights. Big apartment building on the right. Turn left at them lights, then right at the next set. That will put you on your way out of town going east."
367579,doack,2009-07-29 13:23:00,46, Thanks!
367580,Jonny,2009-07-29 13:30:00,1380," Still?  When we were thru a couple of years ago it was a mess. They must be doing a LOT of work. Well, eventually it'll be good.  ---  I'm no connoiseur of cigars. I'll happily smoke Tampa Sweet Perfecto's when I can get 'em."
367582,Dara,2009-07-29 13:34:00,3052,"OK, here we go Cigars are now at Romes Independant Grocery Store. They have a nice little smoke shop at the front of the store. I kinda forgot about it as I don't go there much, or smoke.  Go your regular route off the bridge, but follow the signs to Hwy 17 north. You will turn left off Wellington to Pim St. Up past Canadian Tire on the right, turn right into the mall parking. The top end of the mall is the grocery store. To get out of town east again. Go out of the mall the way you came in, left at the Canadian Tire corner (McNabb st), all the way down there and down the big hill. Right at the bottom and left out to 17 east.  Catch some fish"
367586,Dara,2009-07-29 13:36:00,3052,"  We can hardly get anywhere in town right now. But I'll tell you, I been to North Bay, Sudbury, Thunder bay....we have the best roads anywhere"
367592,TC1OZ,2009-07-29 13:44:00,987,Buy a tub of Century Sams
367595,doack,2009-07-29 13:57:00,46," You da man!  I know right where you are talking.  I will have a full report when we get back!  How has the cooler weather been for the fishing up there?  Any patterns messed up good or bad by it?  We will be fishing mostly Pike and Walleye, but two of the lakes we can portage too have Lakers and white fish.  Can't wait."
367597,backbay,2009-07-29 14:00:00,773,"If your guy wants a treat, see this guy. Cuban tobacco, choice of wrappers, rolled at the shop by nice Cuban ladies. A really unique place to visit.  http://www.correnticigars.com/contact.php Otherwise, I would look for Macanudo HAmpton Courts, which are very nice, not Cuban, but won't break the bank, either, and are sold in tubes that keep them fresh. Or, try Yitz's, just west of Avenue Rd. on Eglington. Bis selection, reasonably priced. Hope that helps!"
367598,Dara,2009-07-29 14:01:00,3052,"Its just cooler. Fishing has been late developing in the river, but any lakes would be normal. Its walleye and pike in northern Ontario..how can you miss."
367601,blaque,2009-07-29 14:12:00,2419," Yeah that makes sense.......im not a cigar smoker so im not speaking with any experience ive just always wondered if it is a taste thing with the cubans that have such a reputation, or are they smoother, (dont even know waht that means lol) or do they add a little goofy juice to them lol or what.  If its just the fact that they are hard to get and thats the onyl factor that gives them such a reputation, and they actually taste like cow manure, then im thoroughly disappointed lol"
367622,CLofchik,2009-07-29 14:56:00,854," Comparing Cubans to the rest of the cigar world is like comparing Scottish whiskey to Crown Royal.  I wholly agree on the Duty Free being absolutely useless for cigars.  I found my Cuban connection on a Native Reservation, Montecristo #4's for $250/box, which is downright great.  Buying cigars retail in Ontario, get ready to bend over.  You'll be looking at $400-$500 easy, where do you think Obama got his tobacco sin tax ideas?"
367630,blaque,2009-07-29 15:26:00,2419," So which is better....the scottish whiskey or the crown....i dont relate to this analogy either LOL. I know one thing, im glad im not a whiskey or cigar connosouier. $  $  How many cigars you get in a box for $250 dollars. Ya better get 250 of them to be ""downright great"" in my books LOL"
367643,TC1OZ,2009-07-29 16:11:00,987,"hahaha blaque, you'd be happy with a tub of sammies"
367644,TC1OZ,2009-07-29 16:12:00,987,  Its like comparing one brand of fishing rod to another...if its not your thing then the comparison really doesn't make a difference to you!
367645,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-29 16:18:00,0,"as suggested by dara, there is a tobacconist at romes grocery store in the cambrian mall...it's called holy smokes i think! anywho, a decent cigar that would COMPLETELY break the bank are guantanamera's.  They are fairly mild and definitely tasty."
