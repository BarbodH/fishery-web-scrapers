367815,Fisherman,2009-07-30 00:33:00,7201,"Normally at this time of year there would be the odd salmon coming up, so far I have not seen or heard of any, not surprised after the last 4-5 years it's getting worse every year.  Lack of food for the salmon, far too many nets, cormorants, it all adds up.  You might be better off fishing in the river just upstream from the boat launch in the park, there's the odd bass and walleye, catfish and carp for fun."
367820,misfish,2009-07-30 00:49:00,29133,"Fish the mouth real early in the am.Bass and the odd walleye can be had,Lots of cats too."
367831,Cudz,2009-07-30 01:24:00,2652,big cats for sure.  Always carp around and you might get an eye

368149,danjang,2009-07-30 21:57:00,148,Thanks all! Haven't been doing much fishing this summer due to work and rain. Can't wait to catch anything really lol.
