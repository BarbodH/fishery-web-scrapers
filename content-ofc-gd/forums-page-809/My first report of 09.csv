Found a little honey hole this year that seems to be producing really well and some really great baits! Anyway, here are some pics of the 3 fish i caught there!     The bait that worked so well was some of the BaitGirl specials in black and yellow, my first 2 casts i had the first 2 fish. Then the lightning started and i decided to head home. Hopefully some more reports to come!  Denis"
