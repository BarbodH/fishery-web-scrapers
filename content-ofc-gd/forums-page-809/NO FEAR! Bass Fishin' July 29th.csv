367859,Rich,2009-07-30 02:26:00,3927,"Headed out today knowing full well what we were about to fish in. It was POURING rain, it couldn't have possibly been raining any harder. Backing up to the launch we couldn't see out the windshield of the truck. Soaked the second the doors were open.  BAM! The boat was in the water and we were fishing. There was wind, tons of rain and thunder, some lightning... we pounded the lake to death and caught a lot of small bass. One encounter with a maybe 3.5lber on a buzzbait and a small pike but no huge fish to be in awe of today. As luck would have it the only time it wasn't raining that I caught a bass was when I caught my smallest of the day so that was the only pic I got. Buddy Sean got a little better one pic'd.  Spinnerbaits, buzzbaits and grubs were the weapons of choice.  I can't believe anyone would sit inside looking out at that rain coming down. That makes me run to the lake! And to end it.. the evening turned out pretty nice actually.   A good foot of water after 20 min of rain in the bottom of the Bass Hound   I did catch some better ones than THIS, lol in the heavy rain though so I didn't want to get the camera out   Sean's 2 pounder which was probably the big fish of the day   A decent sunset over the lake   So worn out and hungry after... demolished a Wendy's classic triple combo and a spicy chicken on the side! lol  Awesome afternoon on the water. I love it!"
367863,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-30 02:31:00,2050,"Right on buddy!  You don't have to lie though, we know you can cacth bass bro, we all have bad days! Lol that little guy is nothing to be ashamed of!  Glad to see you had a chance to hit the water!  Peace"
367867,Rich,2009-07-30 02:35:00,3927,"Aw screw you! LOL no lies, I actually AS PER USUAL put a whoopin' on with my spinnerbait!"
367878,ADB,2009-07-30 02:39:00,444,"I'm more impressed with your Wendy's meal, than with your report, actually."
367879,Leecher,2009-07-30 02:40:00,7832,Attaboy Rich Somehow I just knew you would target bass!!!  Cool Leechman
367890,Mike the Pike,2009-07-30 02:54:00,3421, The after fishing foods feast are often part of Rich's reports .  Who's boat was that Rich ?Do you still have the 14ft tinny?  A little rain never hurt anyone I hope you were not out with heavy lightning?  
367903,Rich,2009-07-30 03:09:00,3927,"That's my other boat MTP.. 9' ""Bass Hound"". And yes the Filth Hound is still alive and well. Actually I got a trailer for it now. Just a little tougher to launch the aluminum than the bass hound... and the 14 footer isn't really necessary for the lake we were fishing (really more of a pond).  There was some lightning but nothing too bad.  And I'm known for demolishing two Classic triple combos in a sitting! LOL I was takin' it easy today!"
368005,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-30 14:25:00,3761,"Nice fish, guys!  Is that bad for the battery to be sitting in H2O like that?  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
368017,Lunker777,2009-07-30 15:24:00,866, hahaha you always gotta add the spicy chicken on the side man !!!! MMMMMMMM...*drooling*.... is it lunch time yet ?
368088,splashhopper,2009-07-30 19:13:00,2931, Hey Rich.... what boat do you prefer for large ponds(Conservation type areas) and slower/smaller rivers ?  thanks splashhopper
368099,TC1OZ,2009-07-30 19:38:00,987,Solid fishing/eating! hahaha!
368157,Rich,2009-07-30 22:22:00,3927," I'd pretty much live and die in my 14 footer. I don't know if I'll ever ""upgrade"" to anything bigger. It handles everything pretty well .. since I'm not really a deep water trolling type of guy it works just great.  If there's relatively easy access to the pond I'm fishing, I'd much rather throw the tinny in.  However for those hard to reach places where you gotta carry or drag the boat quite a ways, the 9 footer is best.  Actually thinking about getting a flat back canoe instead of the bass hound though. Or keeping all 3 boats. lol"
368158,Paully,2009-07-30 22:25:00,712,I've got a 12 footer as a back up too.... I would never sell it. Easy to carry and it fits in the back of my truck
368169,Kenny G,2009-07-30 22:47:00,118,"Hey Rich, Anyone ever tell you look like Layne Staley from Alice in Chains? Good report by the way. Gotta love fishing in a storm. Kenny G."
368181,Greencoachdog,2009-07-30 23:14:00,8163, Yeah... that's what she said!  Great report and pics Rich!!!  You keep eating that fast food like that and you'll have your anorexia beat in no time Bubba!!!
