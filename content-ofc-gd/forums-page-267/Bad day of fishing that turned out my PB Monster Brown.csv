822848,davey buoy,2013-12-08 11:33:00,5505,Nice fish!!!!
822871,Musky or Specks,2013-12-08 14:57:00,2710,THAT'S A BIG FISH.CONGRATS. SOMETIMES THROWING SOMETHING DIFFERENT LIKE A JIG IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT APPROACH.
822880,Rod Caster,2013-12-08 15:21:00,5784,Wow that's a pounder! I'd be happy with my day after that fish too!
822888,Steve,2013-12-08 16:01:00,2075,"beauty brown.  over 10lbs for sure.  i'm aware of a 20lbs brown that was caught in that same spot, which was caught while the angler was sitting his hard steel lure on the bottom chatting with a friend....browns are opportunistic feeds that will eat just about anything....  my favourite fish!"
822893,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 16:19:00,536,Wow seems like the browns are on fire!!!
822899,BillM,2013-12-08 16:34:00,17367,Wow seems like the browns are on fire!!!  Tis the season..   Anything that imitates an emerald shiner is the ticket.   That brown is pushing double digits for sure.. 10-12lbs would be my guess.
823089,Rich,2013-12-09 11:53:00,3927,Beauty!! Congrats!!
823090,Joeytier,2013-12-09 12:02:00,3990,Awesome fish.  Sometimes those big browns go on feeding frenzies and they'll only react to fast presentations like what you were using.  Congrats
