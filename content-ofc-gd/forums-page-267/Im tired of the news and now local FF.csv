Different ice types ? What's involved, Resources etc ..... 50 chipped holes and you've earned the right to be called the little lake ice legend LOL. because you are a fireboy does not make you an expert on the ice,  your very replies show you think you are above the rest firemen have skills and play an important role in the community but the have zero skills or insight into ice conditions, you are nuts if you believe thst chipping one hole in the ice tells them the condition of the ice...  instead of trying to insult me to prove your point tell us your skills taught by the dept. to tell the conditions of a lake and how many holes you have to drill to tell if the area is safe...  and you say the fact that I chip many holes checking the ice on the way out , means I should pay the bill for rescue  please enlighten me, what should I do  the fireman just told me that is not the thing to do..please tell what is the right way..this is your chance to shine..make it good"
823333,Terry,2013-12-10 10:26:00,14456,"Wow this thread is so utterly ridiculous, that it shouldn't only be locked, but simply deleted. funny a bunch of us were say the same thing should happen to you, Dick"
823334,misfish,2013-12-10 11:00:00,29133,"Ok every body breath.  This is not bash all fire fighters,hell it,s not bashing at all. I am upset that they give out a standard like the chart,then go and say it,s not safe. Then like said. They let someone with no idea at all,speak on camera. It was total bull.  I will agree,not all ice is safe ice. Water flow,currents,channels make the ice different.  I will be stopping by the CTV after work,and be dropping off the chart,just so he can maybe,understand.  Dick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thats funny. "
823335,lew,2013-12-10 11:04:00,12766,"Rather than posting your complaints about what the firefighters said on this forum, why not contact the Fire Dept Chief and voice your concerns there. If you guys feel the FF are giving false advice,  take it to the top."
823262,Terry,2013-12-10 02:17:00,14456,"it really was a sad, despicable propaganda  crap  those firefighters were spouting  kids were playing hockey 20 ft off shore on solid 5"" black ice and those stupid, self important firefighters were standing there insulting the parents... I use to respect them but it was a lie on top of a lie to make the news, Sandy Stevens with the fire department. is a moron"
823265,Richie Razor,2013-12-10 02:25:00,536,"According to people that risk they're lives to save others 24/7 365 days a year, they are saying to keep off the ice.  I don't see the disconnect here, simple message. Stay off!!!!! (For now)"
823268,Ron,2013-12-10 02:31:00,1683,"While I do agree, don't go if you don't know. We constantly check the thickness of the ice when we venture out. But people speculating on the thickness of the ice from shore can get really frustrating. The kids were skating on 5 inches of ice, plenty safe above the guidelines recommended. As for the locals putting the thoughts of unsafe ice, did they actually go out and test the thickness? These are the opinions from lack of knowledge, it makes everyone else that has taken the proper precautions look like we deserve the Darwin award. Even the Fire Department measured with inadequate tools. Take the butt of an axe handle and ""eye it"" to the bottom of the ice, ya there is safety for ya. That is just like a police officer pulling you over for speeding and the officer gives you a ticket for doing 20 km/hr over the speed limit because it ""looked"" like you were going that fast! I guess in the total scheme of things though, it makes for good news."

So they can focus on other things in life rather then people reading an online report about ""safe ice"" and have to spend all day endangering themselves because someone 'read' something online saying it was/is safe."

823275,Sinker,2013-12-10 02:36:00,8692,Nobody knows how safe ice is unless you get on it and check.  S.
823276,Freshtrax,2013-12-10 02:37:00,2215,If there's five inches have atter....more than enough ice to fish and play hockey.

This board is ""lurked"" by hundreds potentially.....so I read what you just wrote thinking the whole lake is safe, I go out and I go through and drown, because I read your report saying its safe.... And the firefighters are irresponsible????"
823282,Terry,2013-12-10 02:57:00,14456,"did I say the whole lake was safe  I thought I said everywhere I went and the middle is safe and where the kids were playing hockey if I said the whole lake was safe that is wrong over by the river could be dicey but I was talking in response to what the fireboys said, one hole and they knew what was what  and every day  things change.......so what I say today has no relevance for the next day/week  and if you are stupid enough to think because it was safe one day that you can just walk out there, then my advise is take up knitting, icefishing isn't your thing  and tell you where we were not  a chance, until the news report we did not tell anyone what lake we were on"
823286,Joey,2013-12-10 03:07:00,9122,"I don't think the season (month) has anything to do with when or when not to go on the ice.  If it has been cold enough to make 5"" of ice, I would consider that safe.  I watched the newscast and was embarrassed by it.  I'm sure the parents checked as they went out, as did the fishermen, spud, walk, spud, walk.  Pretty simple.  I agree with you Brian and Terry, and I would follow you out there too!"
823295,kickingfrog,2013-12-10 03:21:00,8333,"If everyone did what they were supposed to almost no one would fall through the ice. Sadly, we all know too well, this is not the case.  An interview with someone out on the ice might have provided some balance. As the norm with most news the ""story"" was already decided and they just wanted some sound bits for it.  And if they weren't going to interview someone out on the ice they could have mention/demonstrated how to check the ice as you go out."
823298,Freshtrax,2013-12-10 03:29:00,2215,If you you out on ice and don't check as you go December 8th in ontairo it's your own fault when you go through nobody else's.  get a grip.
823300,DundasSteelheader,2013-12-10 03:34:00,166,"Wow I had no idea people cared about a firefighter report on the news so much. If it bothers you so much why don't you just flip to another news channel? If anything the report benefits you as now there will be less people on the lake and therefore less fishing pressure?     Do you think I can't read or something?   Who said there was 1.5inches of ice out there?   I said, anyone who WALKS ON 1.5inches of ice deserves a Darwin award..    The forum police need to lay off the eggnog.  x2  Thanks for the laugh Bill"

Not winternet posts that I can see yet here BUT when you have invalid points being posted you can see why some what to defend their side of the story. IE, ice being 1/32"" thick vs 4' type of posts.  Go test it... For me, this Crothless House person has YET to say anything worthwhile EVER on this site so I just L at them.  Then you have Joey and many others (of whom I have not met F2F yet) that post and I take as reasonable to great info. So we ALL should take what we read online as 2% true."

823320,ctdd2006,2013-12-10 05:04:00,531,Catch anything??  lol.  Sorry.  I kinda understand both sides.  Me and a bunch of buddies just had this same debate over the weekend.  We are all avid ice fishermen and only two outta seven were willing to venture out and we are almost four hours north of Barrie.  To each their own.  Everyone's comfort level is different but I don't think the FF was being misleading. They were being overcautious maybe.  They said to stay off all lakes.  I'm guessing at least 7/10 bodies of water around Barrie are unsafe like here...and 7/10 people watching that news story don't know better.
823329,chris.brock,2013-12-10 07:48:00,4053,"this doesn't have any relevance to the debate, but some readers might find it interesting  when I was young, we skated on thin ice quite a bit, the cool thing is that the ice gives you plenty of warning, first some cracking, then more cracking, then the toe of your blade goes through a couple times,etc  it's not like you're going in on a break-away and suddenly disappear with a splash  anyways, this was interesting, after-work read, everybody seems pretty fiesty"
823203,misfish,2013-12-09 23:16:00,29133,"I just watched the most ignorant view of safe ice. Not only from the Barrie FF but from some dumb    that was saying I wouldnt be out on 1.5 "" with a heater in  hut.Oh look at those guys way out there. hey ole man,dont speak of what you dont know. Kids playing hockey on a SOLID 5"" of ice,close to shore. Even the FF measured. Yup 5 inches.,and they still say not safe.  GMAB   WHY WHY WHY,DO THEY CONTINUE TO SCARE PEOPLE?The news that is?
