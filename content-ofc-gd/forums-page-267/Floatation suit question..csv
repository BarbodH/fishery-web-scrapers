823864,davew3,2013-12-12 15:52:00,430,"My friend was recently pulled over on the water by the OPP marine unit.   He was told that the bright orange Mustang suit was not regarded as an approved life jacket.   I read the label and it says ""Approved by the CCG"".  So my question is,  are the float jackets and survival suits a legal life preserver?  Any info would be appreciated."
823866,BillM,2013-12-12 16:04:00,17367,OPP was wrong.
823877,Lunkerhunter,2013-12-12 17:16:00,455,i was going to say the same thing Bill. I have been pulled over on the lake before and had 3 people including myself in my boat. i was wearing my mustang floater suit and had 2 life jackets for my passengers.  OPP checked the 2 life jackets and other necessary gear and let me go without question.
823911,Terry,2013-12-12 20:03:00,14456,well the cop is wrong or or he was not wearing it  it must be worn to be considered a legal floatation device

824005,Woodsman,2013-12-13 06:00:00,1286,"If it is Canadian Coast Guard approved, then it should count.  I understand that not all of them are coast guard approved. The Canadian Coast Guard haso not been the approving agency in Canada for many years. Transport Canada is the authorized agency now. That being said if it is an older suit that was approved by the Canadian Coast Guard, than as long as it is in good condition it's still legally OK."
