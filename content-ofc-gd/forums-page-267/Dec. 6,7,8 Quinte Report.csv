823355,Fish Farmer,2013-12-10 13:32:00,2234,"Thanks for the replys guys. I should have mentioned what set up we used. I think I used 20 different deep running lures and the best set up was a purplish pink Reef Runner with a 1 once snap, 15Lb braid, running back 200' from the inline boards. 100' of water in the channel out from Keith's  Shoul. I did hear some better reports from weeks that we weren't there. I guess as my signature says."
