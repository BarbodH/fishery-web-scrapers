823438,woodenboater,2013-12-10 20:46:00,2277,Watershed bags are THE best out there imo. I've got a couple that I use for spring whitewater trips and they've never let me down. Bit more spendy than other brands but you get what you pay for. Roll down bags WILL leak if they see any amount of water so I don't use those for anything important.
