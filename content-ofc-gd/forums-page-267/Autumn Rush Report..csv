821279,spinnerdoc,2013-11-30 13:34:00,556,Very nice Moosebunk.....I love these reports of yours.  Makes for a good read....and visual. Inspiring to say the least. These reports are as close to fishing I get these days. Thanks
821536,Moosebunk,2013-12-01 13:54:00,3970,"I've gotta compliment your choice of music. LOVE the band!!! Keep on rockin!      It,s something I want to do,but I would need to be with one thats got experince. in this kinda river travel.  Friend of mine floats the river each year Brian.  I could ask which stretches would be best for a floattube.  Would surely depend on levels too.  But think of the honey holes you could access.   Definitely more interesting than the leaf game on right now!  Anything is more interesting than a Leafs game... thanks...   I think...?   Of course, i don't mind that landmark ( stacks ) in the background which tells me where you are. Not that its necessarily a secret.  Launched in Picton but drove across the lake.  Those are actually the stacks in Oswego.    Thanks for checking in folks.  Been 10 years now... and always do appreciate the kind words, any feedback, keeping in touch, and putting my fishing out there on the www."
821538,Moosebunk,2013-12-01 13:56:00,3970,These reports are as close to fishing I get these days. Thanks   No fun to hear Doc.  Hopefully that changes in 2014.

821728,S.M.05,2013-12-02 04:11:00,145,Looks like another fantastic fall for you Drew. Now that the lakes are starting to lock up we need to plan some ice fishn trips.

820941,Jds63,2013-11-28 16:57:00,1365,"Phenomenal !!!! 56"" incher brute ... beautiful pics"
820943,msp,2013-11-28 17:06:00,1336,Well there goes my season report. Well done this fall. A great multi species report as usual....... and that little musky !
820948,irishfield,2013-11-28 17:30:00,26272,So it really was a slow night in the ER last night!  Gotta stop doing this to us Bunker!
820949,mike rousseau,2013-11-28 17:32:00,4661,Some nice fish....  Especially with the weather we had this year...
820950,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-28 17:38:00,4399,"Always enjoy reading your reports, fantastic year and great photography!!!"
820951,lew,2013-11-28 17:38:00,12766,"Outstanding as always MB, specially  those big toothy guys !! Kinda makes you wonder about wasting time on all those other species eh ??"
820953,Rich Nelson,2013-11-28 18:09:00,332,Great report with some awesome fish!
820959,Moosebunk,2013-11-28 18:42:00,3970,So it really was a slow night in the ER last night!  Gotta stop doing this to us Bunker!   Steady trickle to about 2:00am Wayne when the final patient made it through.  Puck in the head with a big laceration.  Was playing on ice right beside the Queensway Carleton Hospital but chose to drive through a snow storm rather than wait 8 hours in the ER there overnight.  Can't blame him.  After that I was You-Tubin (I mean swamped with quality control duties    ) the night away.  60 hours down in 5 days.  2 1/2 off then back to t.  December/January & July/August are the busiest work months of the year. Hopefully they all go smooth as two nights ago.   Kinda makes you wonder about wasting time on all those other species eh ??    You know Lew it does.    Four days after the biggun went fishing for smallies and couldn't have cared less if one was caught.  Even though I really do like smallie fishing.  Understanding your sickness more now young feller... after all those years muskie fishing you're pretty well chronically ill I'd bet.

821015,Moosebunk,2013-11-29 00:31:00,3970,"Wish I fished as much as you do. Well done.   Remarkably, past three years have all seen the exact same number of days fished.  Wished 2013 I fished just one more.   BLAH BLAH BLAH,it kinda turned out hum DRUM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LOL  Think I caught myself waving back at ya.LOL  Cant wait to get the tube out next year. They are a blast Drew.   That was a wave???  Pretty sure you were giving the one finger salute. Tired of being in your shadow Brian.  So tired.  But seriously... thinking your tube needs to hit some spring runoff tribs and you double drift your way into a pile 'o steelies.  Geen would be doable no?    Thanks fellers."
