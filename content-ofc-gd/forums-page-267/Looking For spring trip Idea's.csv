823112,Gallie,2013-12-09 15:03:00,1215,I might suggest picking up one of the backroad mapbooks for the general area you like. It will give you a basic description of whats in the lakes and show you how to get there. If your willing to drive 10 hours there are probably 1000 pike and walleye lakes you could choose from
823121,bare foot wader,2013-12-09 15:56:00,1354,"Little Abitibi prov park, fsr access to river at south end of Pierre lake, can then boat into Pierre, Montreuil and Harris, excellent walleye and pike, lots of moose and bears around, also brookie lakes in the area  bugs will be killer in early june, definitely want to pack a full bug suit"
823138,chris.brock,2013-12-09 16:54:00,4053,"with the boat and camping, I'd look at Ramsay Lk (near Biscotasing), good walleye, some pike  other lakes to check out- Biscotasing, Horwood, the north end of Onaping, Windermere, Big Missinaibi I'm assuming you load up the boat, and head down the lake to find a camping spot  for the ATV back lake stuff, you could set up base camp at Wakami PP near Chapleau and do exploration and day trips from there, lots of walleye/ pike lakes around  Tayzak may chime in with some help about the area around Folyet"
823170,SirCranksalot,2013-12-09 19:33:00,3291,"If you and your son don't mind going with a couple of old geezers( 60+), we are looking at going to Bisco. One of our 4 some from last year dropped out and one other guy is lukewarm and wouldn't mind being 'cut from the line-up"". PM me if interested. If not.........noooo prob!"

Once you get past Cat bay at the top end of the lake there's very few people. Big beautiful lake with good walleye fishing although it seems to be more seasonal. June is prime time...  If it's just you and your son you may want to consider a fly in out of Chapleau. You'd likely be surprised how affordable it really is and the experience is worth it.  PM me if you want details."
