823494,RickOnt,2013-12-11 00:08:00,669,Couple pics from the end of the Gilford Road  We are losing ice There was more ice in the bottom of the bay a week ago.  The wind is doing the damage  We will be getting some cold temps the next few days but if the winds are 35 kicks she will not freeze.  However I am still wishing for a feed of Perch before Xmas   Ist Pic is looking East to Crates  2nd Pic is looking  SE to the River  See yas on the Hard Stuff Rick

823497,Richie Razor,2013-12-11 00:13:00,536,"Well that's not good. I was saying by the week of the 21st-22nd cooks would be good to go.... I still think that's a possibility...... The water is plenty cold, just need cold nights, little wind, and no snow!!!!!"

823505,RickOnt,2013-12-11 00:41:00,669,"I called this a 'Lack' of Ice report just for the ""MisFish""   You guys are definitely right. We really need the winds to lay down.  Even if it's -20'C with 50 Klick winds she will not freeze over. Just make a mess of busted up chuncks  The water is at the right temp to freeze and it would only take a couple days to ice Cooks Bay over.  Once we have a good layer then the winds will build ice."
