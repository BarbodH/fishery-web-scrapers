823613,Steel28,2013-12-11 14:42:00,160,How important is the manufacture date on float suits?  I see a brand new Mustang float suit (Atlantic Class) dated November 2011 being sold in some stores.  thanks
823617,BillM,2013-12-11 14:52:00,17367,Nothing to worry about.
823620,Headhunter,2013-12-11 14:57:00,5703,"Assuming that the suit is properly stored before purchase, than I would think nothing to worry about. Be sure to ensure that all the floation in the suit, is in the right place. After time, the floatation in the suit will move, making it far less than ideal. HH"
823621,Steel28,2013-12-11 15:05:00,160,"Nothing to worry about. sounds good Bill!  Assuming that the suit is properly stored before purchase, than I would think nothing to worry about. Be sure to ensure that all the floation in the suit, is in the right place. After time, the floatation in the suit will move, making it far less than ideal. HH  thanks HH. Well how do we know..these are big box stores. Most likely suites were in storage during off season.  I gave away my Mustang to a friend last season. I have a choice between Mustang Atlantic class made in 2011 vs Integrity HX made in 2013. Atlantic will be about $80 less vs HX.  Also picking up Integrity HX float bibs for mid season and Catalyst jacket."
823628,BillM,2013-12-11 15:16:00,17367,The Mustang Integrity HX is probably the best suit on the market.  They fit small though ( I had to sell mine because it was too short).  Now running a 1pc HH.
823632,Steel28,2013-12-11 15:20:00,160,I have a choice of HH Alpha as well but I've heard that HH suites get very stiff when the temps are drop?  I use to have Integrity HX and really liked it.
823688,jimmer,2013-12-11 20:31:00,2730,"I have a HH and yes it gets stiff when it's cold. Your body heat will loosen it up, but I still find it uncomfortable."
823689,Burtess,2013-12-11 20:35:00,901,I just called Mustang and asked about the suit lifetimes as I have an older Integrity jacket and didn't know how old it was.  They said the rule is 8-10 years from date of manufacture.  The jacket I have is from 2001........ I don't have a warm pool to test it in now either...  Burt
823690,Headhunter,2013-12-11 20:44:00,5703,"thanks HH. Well how do we know..these are big box stores. Most likely suites were in storage during off season.   Make sure that the foam hasn't moved by going over the entire thing, ensuring there is foam where it is supposed to be. If there is an ""extra thick"" part anywhere, likely one of the foam pieces moved. I've heard that the foam may lose some of it's bouyancy characteristics over time, but I can't say for sure. HH"
823691,Terry,2013-12-11 20:51:00,14456,"i was told they had have a 10 year life  so I took my 25 year old boyoboy floater suit and jumped in, floated just fine thank you very much......"
823696,Headhunter,2013-12-11 21:08:00,5703,"LOL Terry! I know a buddy of mine sent his suit back to Mustang to have it re-packed. I believe it was less than half the price of a new suit, but that was some time ago. HH"

823814,porkpie,2013-12-12 12:12:00,2521,My suit is 20 years old and still floats no problems!  I test it at the family cottage every summer!
823834,wormdunker,2013-12-12 13:30:00,1711,I wore a Buoy o Buoy for many years.  Found it bulky & very uncomfortable.  I purchased a 2 piece HJC snowmobile floater suit.  Yes it's not a survival suit but very warm & comfortable.  Also like the 2 piece when I'm in a warm hut it's a nice feature to remove the jacket.
823842,Steel28,2013-12-12 14:28:00,160,"Picked up HH Alpha and at the end, felt very comfortable and really like suspender system/pockets For $330 if was a good deal vs Mustang Atlantic and Integrity HX lines.  I might look at Mustangs over the weekend again but most likely will keep HH Alpha.  I thought of getting two piece suit but decide to stick with one."
823916,misfish,2013-12-12 20:18:00,29133," You might want to look at the two piece. I was always a once piece suit guy,then I went with a 2 piece. What a difference comfort wise. No restrictions. Very warm too."
