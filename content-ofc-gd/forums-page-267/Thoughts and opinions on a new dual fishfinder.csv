Please offer some input on what units you like/dislike, why etc. it doesnt need to be the cats a**, but i want something reliable and usable in relitively shallow water (12-15 fow), but good up to 100+ for lakers. Thanks in advance for any input"

822821,GBW,2013-12-08 03:59:00,8460,Not me but I WANT one too now.  LOL.  I just bought fisherpete's unit for the ice but I need a new unit in the boat (it's an old Paranamax 128 in there now) so it would be ideal for me.
822824,manitoubass2,2013-12-08 04:05:00,11391,"I almost bought that unit today. Controls seem a hassle, bit i think ill grab it nonetheless"
822826,GBW,2013-12-08 04:17:00,8460,If you don't like it and DO buy it and I miss the sale maybe we can work a deal...

822832,GBW,2013-12-08 04:51:00,8460,"Deal.  Sure that's one HELL of a cab ride there but I'll come and I WILL bring some of my smoked walleye provided I have some.  If not, then something else, lol"
823028,landry,2013-12-09 01:45:00,1005,I have the lowrance elite 5 and it's a great unit except for water over 70' - then i have a hard time marking my jig for lakers. Hope u have better luck than me.
