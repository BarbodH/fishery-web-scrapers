823574,wormdunker,2013-12-11 07:54:00,1711,"Ok now it's lesser confoozing?  No,  I don't want to clean up oil spills."
823576,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-11 09:05:00,8243,"Very interesting job for those looking for employment. Too late for this guy. Can be a tad messy and in 99% of cases hazardous if proper safety precautions aren't taken. Way back when, I found that most of the MOE inspectors and investigators were no nonsense retired lawmen, mostly RCMP folks and you will meet them in probability, they ask everyone questions.The best thing about being on the clean up side of a spill you don't have to explain why it happened. That is of course you don't make things worse in the execution of your duties. It will take you to all types of environments, industrial, commercial, laboratories, hospitals, sites of spills of everything from car accidents, train derailments to house fires and marine spills and will meet individuals from all walks of life. I don't know if Rod casters company offers biological clean up but if you don't like the look of blood and guts it might not be something you would be able to handle. Someone has to clean up the site where blood is present in copious amounts. Think Coroners office, I don't need to get graphic to get the point across. I'll tell you it won't be boring. What a bonus working from home. Plenty of time for fishing and hunting. If you're a 9 to 5 kind of guy or gal that doesn't like excitement or action this isn't the thing for you. You need to stay sober as you may be called into action at any given time. The crews we used were drug tested regularly.  Wormdunker, it entails more than throwing some Speedy Dry on some oil and shoveling it into a wheelbarrow. It's a bit more than a glorified laborer. Some of the stories the guys told me were something else."
823699,aplumma,2013-12-11 21:27:00,6896,Since it appears you ran out of N's here is a couple extra ones I had laying around NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNnnnnnnnnnnnn.   Lol  Best of the day  Art
823967,Rod Caster,2013-12-13 01:36:00,5784,"hahaha Art. your avatar is freaking me out!  Ironmaker, you're pretty spot on. We are consultants so our role is mainly managing the site, documenting, talking with clients and ensuring the jobs don't spiral out of control either cost-wise or mis-managment wise.  And, sometimes there are fatalities during the accidents, so we are sensitive to that as well. Not fun in those cases, but it's part of the job.  The MOE Officers are typically friendly and lately, it seems that they don't have the resources to partake in the cleanup, they just wait for our reports and follow up later on. Things get litigious very often, so we use foresight to the best of our abilities to protect our clients.  Working on an interesting spill right now near Timmins, someone is getting a fine for this one.... they didn't report the spill for a few days and things are worse than they should have been."
