823661,Richie Razor,2013-12-11 17:11:00,536,Seems like the logistics from ordering your card and receiving it has improved.
823682,highdrifter,2013-12-11 19:16:00,2534," Yup,mo money,less bang for yer buck.  We get to pay to play.  Isn't the MNR outsourcing to a company out in the states for the new card?  That's progress for ya..  I miss my turkey too!!"
823788,fishnsled,2013-12-12 03:50:00,3520,"My card came today, 7 days after filling out the information online.  Pretty good service compared to some of the nightmares guys were having last year. Guess they got the bugs worked out, ready for the new year.      I do wonder how long it will take before the numbers wear off the card, at least the old ones had raised lettering."

821762,misfish,2013-12-02 16:47:00,29133,"Apparently, you need to have a non-expiring card to do on line. Is this true?"
821832,TennesseeGuy,2013-12-03 00:32:00,957,"I'm into buying bananas that show a little yellow, not all green, so I'll be waiting until around mid February to make my purchase.   I've bought a bunch of non-resident fishing licenses for Ontario.    Got a good return on my investment.   Every time."
821834,aplumma,2013-12-03 00:37:00,6896,I found that when I go up North I can not only buy my card and license from the lodge we visit. The hard card is then mailed to me Stateside it works very well.   Art
821870,John Bacon,2013-12-03 05:47:00,3277,"Apparently, you need to have a non-expiring card to do on line. Is this true?  That doesn't seem to be the case.  Although it does appear that the three year license option has been eliminated... I wonder whose idea that was."
821882,misfish,2013-12-03 11:10:00,29133,"Thanks Jason  I,ll be walking into the office this morning. I,ll dought there will be a line up."

821900,Garnet,2013-12-03 14:10:00,2056,"Did the phone thing. Got thru 1st time, had to press 1 maybe 86 times and if my license doesn't show up by J1 I can't fish.  I have the verification # so I will be on Simcoe, minden Area or the Ganny weather my licensee gets here or not."

821917,Gregoire,2013-12-03 16:19:00,1397,"The Three year card is the way to go. Only problem is that I have to remember to renew it in 3 years..advantage is I don't have to wait every year for a card that takes months to arrive, if it even arrives at all."
821928,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-03 18:36:00,2582,"Did the phone thing. Got thru 1st time, had to press 1 maybe 86 times and if my license doesn't show up by J1 I can't fish.  I have the verification # so I will be on Simcoe, minden Area or the Ganny weather my licensee gets here or not. X2."

821943,davey buoy,2013-12-03 20:45:00,5505,I guess they don't give us yearly guys a days grace for Jan 1/14?.Think they would look at that knowing the system?
