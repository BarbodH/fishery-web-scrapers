823444,ONbuckhunter,2013-12-10 21:17:00,39,"Also you need a season.  You do realize when, how and the general reality of how easily the males can be pressured while protecting the nest right?  And how that can implicate the future generations?  Both responses to chatkhouse.  Quotes aren't working on my end."
823456,Joeytier,2013-12-10 22:13:00,3990,"I could do without 'future generations' of bass around here.  Considering noone fishes for them up here anyway, It'd be nice to have a year round season with reduced trout and walleye limits, and help cull some of the lakes where they've 'invaded' (introduced)."
823462,ONbuckhunter,2013-12-10 22:30:00,39,"Maybe in Northeastern Ontario excluding Abitibi and temiskaming areas.  Too many knuckleheads in this area killing every bass they see because they are hungry.  Bass to me are a heck of a lot more important than introduced garbage like, Chinooks, Rainbows, Browns and Cohos.  Just kidding but in reality same arguments on both sides.  Both have very important sport fishing benefits in most ranges.  Heck Bass are far more at home here than the others excluding the far North.  Pike here are the biggest problem.  Kawarthas may be in a lot of trouble."
823917,Fisherpete,2013-12-12 20:32:00,1814,There are lots of brown trout to be found in the sewers too  Wouldn't touch one though if I were you

822836,irishfield,2013-12-08 05:11:00,26272,Why I keep saying make them open season everywhere.... the next parasite in every water system!
822849,Handlebarz,2013-12-08 12:01:00,3790,Looks like he was going to keep it also that would be handy to keep kids busy
822866,Rod Caster,2013-12-08 14:09:00,5784,Why I keep saying make them open season everywhere.... the next parasite in every water system! x2 especially in the north where barely anyone fishes for them.
822902,buckster,2013-12-08 16:57:00,530,I always had dreams of fishing the catch basin in front of my house when I was a kid lol
822913,BillM,2013-12-08 17:15:00,17367,"x2 especially in the north where barely anyone fishes for them.  There is no closed season for bass way up north, lol."
822915,SirCranksalot,2013-12-08 17:23:00,3291,You guys rather catch those wet rags they call pickerel of walleye???
822991,jbailey,2013-12-08 23:21:00,866,"haha, i wonder where that is"
822992,BillM,2013-12-08 23:29:00,17367,"haha, i wonder where that is  I'd guess Florida."
823032,Joeytier,2013-12-09 01:54:00,3990,
823041,Christopheraaron,2013-12-09 02:20:00,3525,"LOL, why wouldn't they lift the grate off?"
823044,Richie Razor,2013-12-09 02:26:00,536,Bass should be open year round in Ontario. Man that would be sweet.
823096,craigdritchie,2013-12-09 12:26:00,1586,"LOL, why wouldn't they lift the grate off?  Because bass are not the only things living down there!"
823109,Roy,2013-12-09 14:49:00,13728,"LOL, why wouldn't they lift the grate off?  Removing sewer grates for the purpose of fishing is illegal in all states except Texas."
823123,ch312,2013-12-09 16:07:00,1590,You guys rather catch those wet rags they call pickerel of walleye???   Those wet rags are typically harder to catch than those sewer dwelling sunfish
823124,porkpie,2013-12-09 16:11:00,2521,"You guys rather catch those wet rags they call pickerel of walleye???  I wish more people would eat bass,  They are almost as tasty as pickerel, and easier to come by!  I keep a limit of bass a couple times a year for dinner fish.  Keeps the pressure off the pickerel!"
823146,Richie Razor,2013-12-09 17:20:00,536, Agreed!!! Cold water smallies in the 2lb range are good eaters. Also deep cold water fall largies taste like a big bluegill.... Delicious.  There should be an eat more bass campaign in Ontario.... Lol
823149,Christopheraaron,2013-12-09 17:31:00,3525," I wish more people would eat bass,  They are almost as tasty as pickerel, and easier to come by!

823153,grimsbylander,2013-12-09 17:48:00,3016,To bad the name for crappie fishing has already been taken.
823179,jimmer,2013-12-09 20:06:00,2730,That's crazy.
823230,jbailey,2013-12-10 00:21:00,866,"Agreed!!! Cold water smallies in the 2lb range are good eaters. Also deep cold water fall largies taste like a big bluegill.... Delicious.  There should be an eat more bass campaign in Ontario.... Lol I agree, the smaller cold water smallies taste great.   x2, IMO they are better than walleye, but not perch. They're pretty tastey but better than walleye?! Perch and walleye are bar far the most scrumptious.    Makes me wanna take a trip to the Erie Beach Hotel nomnomnom"
823319,ONbuckhunter,2013-12-10 05:00:00,39,I really hope your kidding Chotchkie.
823357,Richie Razor,2013-12-10 13:39:00,536," But hey, I ain't no freshwater biologist."
823410,hammercarp,2013-12-10 18:25:00,964,And here's more. Catfish and bluegills in Texas. http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2013/12/chatting-guy-who-fishes-mudcats-storm-sewer/7826/ .
823443,ONbuckhunter,2013-12-10 21:12:00,39,"As long as they are under slot then I'd be fine.  If they are large breeder females I have a huge issue with that.  Anyone with half a brain would.  They are a very important sport fish.  I do agree with them in Northern Lakes needing to have smaller ones culled.  In the kawarthas and other lakes they under plenty of enough pressure.  But hey Im a technologist who fishes a lot of tourneys, not an ichthyologist."
