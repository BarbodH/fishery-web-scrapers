823596,RangerGuy,2013-12-11 13:43:00,564,"Dropped my boat off for it's second service this weekend.  I checked the oil after my last trip (when we got home).  I leveled the motor by putting a level on the anticavitation plate. The oil level does not look like it's changed since the last service, but the oil has a gassy smell.  Should I mention this to the dealer? It only has 65 hours on the motor ( I was expecting more LOL!) and it has only had the 1 scheduled oil change.  Is this cause for concern?"
823597,mike rousseau,2013-12-11 13:47:00,4661,If gas is getting in your oil you'll ruin your motor...  It happened to my F150...
823604,RangerGuy,2013-12-11 14:21:00,564,I wasn't sure if maybe outboard engine oil smell different that regular 10-30 used in cars.  I email the dealer just to let them know about it. My other outboards have been mixed so I don't know what it's supposed to smell like LOL!
823607,Moosebunk,2013-12-11 14:31:00,3970,"As long as your gas doesn't smell like oil... cause that'd be something weird to think about, especially after your friday night out drinking with the fellas."
823608,DanD,2013-12-11 14:33:00,2223,"It's not uncommon to see/smell that on a 4 stroke, if it has been doing a lot of low RPM running. But you've done the right thing by letting the dealer know your concern; there a fine line between normal and excessive fuel in the oil. With you telling them this, they should check the fuel system; making sure that the motor isn't being over fueled.  Dan."
823612,RangerGuy,2013-12-11 14:40:00,564,"Thanks guys!  I emailed them, I'm sure they will take care of it if they deem it an issue         As long as your gas doesn't smell like oil... cause that'd be something weird to think about, especially after your friday night out drinking with the fellas. What are you saying Moosebunk HAHA!"
823629,BillM,2013-12-11 15:17:00,17367,Outboard oil is regular motor oil like you'd use in your car...  no matter what fancy bottle it's put in
823695,aplumma,2013-12-11 21:07:00,6896,Idling will cause a build up of gas in the oil but you also are running it in cold weather and if the engine does not come up to temperature it can not evaporate the gas that gets by the rings.   Art
823706,RangerGuy,2013-12-11 21:46:00,564,"Thanks everybody for the input :-)  maybe it was because my last trip was 2 hours of trolling in 39-42 deg water then just mushing back through the waves , with no on plane running haha!  By what everybody is saying this is to be expected, so I'm not gonna stress over it :-)  I will pay more attention to it next year as I believe it is my last year of warranty."
823728,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-11 23:24:00,10439,"Yeah, my oil smells like gas in my new Merc. It is due to our cold water temps here and lots of trolling. My mechanic told me to use different oil as the stuff specified in the manual is a little too thick for our conditions.  I'm not making any oil though so that is good. If you notice that you have more oil after running for a couple of trips it's time to worry then. I replace my oil religiously so know I won't have oil problems."
823772,fish_fishburn,2013-12-12 01:57:00,1311,Could be a ring that's not seated properly.
823779,ecmilley,2013-12-12 02:38:00,2163,Perfectly normal no problemsm barely broke on
824020,Sinker,2013-12-13 13:32:00,8692,"Ya, no worries. Google yamaha 4 stroke making oil if you want to learn more about it. Basically cause from running below preffered temp. Common on 4 stroke outboards.  S."
