823159,davey buoy,2013-12-09 18:55:00,5505,"Different people find different styles of comedy funny to them.  I love Monty Python style of humour.  Many, many people don't.  I also think Ron Burgandy is funny.  There's no need to call someone who finds something funny that you don't ""small brained"".  Not appreciated. Thanks vtbass,I must have a small brain as well?lol Thought it must of been just me?Dan passes judgement pretty quick as I have noticed.Imagine someone asking for what TV to buy on a fishing forum?I did,why not?I gain so much knowledge and recommendation from folks on OFC,I listen to there input.may or may not act on there advice,but I mostly do .He needs to think twice and think that what he does not like,not that everyone else has a small brain.His choice of comedy may be different from some,but I would not cal him any different for his opinion.Relax DAN!!! I hear all the digs,sometimes I say NOTHING.This time I did."
823176,Richie Razor,2013-12-09 19:57:00,536,How the hell can you not find Will Ferrell funny?!?!??!  The guy is a comic genius and one of the funniest comics of all time.  Wow.

823181,Richie Razor,2013-12-09 20:18:00,536,"Ya I know, just uncalled for the ""small brain"" comment. But still Will Ferrell is freakin hilarious and Anchorman is an institution!!!"
823201,Joeytier,2013-12-09 22:55:00,3990," Sorry, I had to."
