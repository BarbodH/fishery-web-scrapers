Aside from roe, any other artificial you tried? Saw some crankbait behind some picture, can they go that deep?"

823507,Aaron Shirley,2013-12-11 00:56:00,655,"Bass fighter, we employ a Three-way rig to bottom bounce with the bottom current. Boat control with Minn Kota is important to keep a slightly vertical presentation. I use 10lb main line on a spinning reel to a small black Three-way swivel. A dropper line same # approximately 10"" to a pencil weight or slinky weight. I prefer slinky between just under 1/2 ounce to 3/4oz. I then tie a 4- to 8lb fluorocarbon leader (4- to 9 feet long) on to a black gammy octopus hook size 8 or 6. I then add either roe, skein, yarn, corky, TriggerX single egg, emerald shiner, TriggerX minnow 3"" in white or something similar.  I also use Kwikfish, Hotshots, streamer flies, and have caught them on crankbaits. Pink worms between 3"" and 8"" are also good, as is orange worms. Casting hair jigs, spoons, spinners can work well, as can floating various baits as mentioned earlier. Jigs under Floats can also work well.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
823509,Aaron Shirley,2013-12-11 00:58:00,655,Thanks for all the nice coments everyone. Hopefully the conditions stay good!
823598,Moosebunk,2013-12-11 13:49:00,3970,Have always enjoyed viewing the great fishing Christine has done through her life.  Kudos to you Aaron for making that such a great day on the water.
