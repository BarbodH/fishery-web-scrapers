823522,bigugli,2013-12-11 01:33:00,6138,Whenever I warm up my frying pan I get the staredown.  Casey and Baxter(the son's dog) are fed better than the Queen. The 2 have good taste too!  Nothing like a perch dinner to keep us healthy..  
823525,livinisfishin,2013-12-11 01:43:00,661,Nice looking meal! Looks like those fillets came off of some decent perch!

823545,bigugli,2013-12-11 02:51:00,6138,They know you're an easy mark. Yuup!   I also know that a regular diet of real fish and meat will make for long healthy lives
823676,highdrifter,2013-12-11 18:34:00,2534,Is that lard?! Cause if it is...  your healthy diet is a little off the mark.. j/k

823745,aplumma,2013-12-12 00:00:00,6896,Strictly oil. Haven't bought lard in nearly 30 years Why is it science keeps proving some of the best tasting things our parents got to eat get taken away from us. WELL NO MORE I am going to eat lard till it kills me because it makes things taste that good.   Art
823748,Richie Razor,2013-12-12 00:05:00,536,"I digress, peanut oil is the absolute tops for frying fish, and with a lot less trans fats....  Now if your eating a shore lunch, well then, break out the smoked bacon fat!!!!!"

823870,grimsbylander,2013-12-12 16:18:00,3016,I have a yellow lab that I swear is one chromosome away from being a seagull. Opening our frig door is like throwing French fries in a McDonalds parking lot.  That perch looks awesome!

824008,aplumma,2013-12-13 11:55:00,6896,"While my lab was good at the cabinet noises I have a red tick coon hound that really tests the limits. I can put the dog outside eat a few jelly beans, let him back in and he will come over and look at me and then check the coffee table for his jelly bean. He has one heck of a nose for sure to watch him run the farm for scent is a pleasure to watch.   Art"
