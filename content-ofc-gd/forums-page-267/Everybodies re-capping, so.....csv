823556,Joey,2013-12-11 03:41:00,9122,"Great update Lew, I too like that last picture"
823644,solopaddler,2013-12-11 15:51:00,8605,Quality over quantity. Nice recap Lew.
823647,grimsbylander,2013-12-11 16:03:00,3016,Awesome fish! They're beasts!
823655,lew,2013-12-11 16:44:00,12766,"Again, It's good to hear you all enjoyed the pics, specially the last one.  Even though that last girl isn't my biggest musky, she was certainly the toughest and gave the best fight I've ever had."
822959,lew,2013-12-08 21:52:00,12766,"Always good at the end of the season when guys show some of their better catches for the year so I thought I'd post a recap too.  Trouble is I've kind of semi retired from fishing lately and only got out a few times but landed a couple nice ones up on the West Arm of Nippissing and even though I posted them before, I'll show them again.  This girl came along in June but I didn't bother measuring  her but I guestimated somewhere around the 50 mark.  Pretty fish whatever her size    This lady came in August and I did measure her which was unusual as I almost never do, specially when I'm alone in the boat like this time.  The camera was on a timer and sitting in a stand on the rear deck so they didn't turn out too good,  but you get the idea.  She measured 51""        There were a couple other caught but I didn't bother with pictures.  Not alot of fish, but they were gooduns."
822961,Roy,2013-12-08 21:57:00,13728,Very nice Lew! I guess you know the West Arm as well or better than anyone else. Beautiful fish...how did they taste?
822963,lew,2013-12-08 21:59:00,12766,Great on the Barbie Roy
822965,BillM,2013-12-08 22:05:00,17367,"Lew, that last pic is pretty funny!  I can just imagine what you're saying while trying to wrestle that beast!"
822971,Handlebarz,2013-12-08 22:14:00,3790,I like the last pic as well and have some of them. That to me is one of the best parts of fishing alone getting lots of pictures on the timer mine is set to take 10 pictures after the 30 second timer goes off which is more then enough time to get the fish out and ready to capture the memory.
822973,lew,2013-12-08 22:18:00,12766,"I normally only take one picture of a fish then get her back in the water, but when she jumped just as the camera flashed I figured the picture was no good so I took the 2nd one.  I agree, it turned out pretty darned good...and funny LOL"
822975,lew,2013-12-08 22:22:00,12766,"And Bill, sorry we never hooked up this year like we talked about, but as I said I haven't hardly been out myself and haven't been on the water since September.  I owe Brian an apology too.  Maybe next year guys."
822976,kickingfrog,2013-12-08 22:23:00,8333,Thank you Lew.
822982,cram,2013-12-08 22:36:00,1733,Those are real beauties.
822985,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 22:41:00,536,That's a beast of a fish. You sure did man handle her. The big fish and scowl look is priceless.... You should apply a heritage filter to the picture... Classic.
822987,davey buoy,2013-12-08 22:43:00,5505,Nice looking beasts there Lew!!!!!!
822990,aplumma,2013-12-08 23:01:00,6896,I will try to book my yearly contest with you to next year Lew. So far I have beaten Lew every outing by not catching a muskie.lol   Art
822996,lew,2013-12-08 23:44:00,12766,"Hopefully 2014 will be your year Art & with any luck, I'll be your net man."
822998,Fisherpete,2013-12-08 23:47:00,1814,Quality always trumps quantity in the muskie world A pair of beauties Lew!
822999,nancur373,2013-12-08 23:48:00,1211,Great on the Barbie Roy I like them wrapped in strips of bald eagle breast simmered in loon broth
823000,BillM,2013-12-08 23:48:00,17367,"And Bill, sorry we never hooked up this year like we talked about, but as I said I haven't hardly been out myself and haven't been on the water since September.  I owe Brian an apology too.  Maybe next year guys.  No apology needed man, many many years on the water still to come"
823001,Moosebunk,2013-12-09 00:09:00,3970,"  Don't let fishing grow old on ya Lew... Grow old with fishing,  Some solid muskies there young fella!"
823011,Ron,2013-12-09 00:36:00,1683,"A couple of very respectable Muskie there Lew.  Cheers, Ron..."
823012,lew,2013-12-09 00:41:00,12766,"Nice effect there Drew, thanks for that, and as for growing old with fishing, well, I've already done that  Thanks guys, glad you enjoyed the pictures"
823026,Richie Razor,2013-12-09 01:32:00,536,Beauty

823076,wormdunker,2013-12-09 10:00:00,1711,Some real beauties there!  Thanx for sharing your photos.
823092,MCTFisher9120,2013-12-09 12:11:00,3761,"Giants, nice job!"
823120,bigbuck,2013-12-09 15:54:00,2449,"This year I was only able to get out once for musky, got a 26incher or so on Pidge. Once for pike, el skunkola. Once for walleye, 2 14inchers that graced the pan. A whack of times on our lake up at the cottage for smallies where I did pretty good. A 4lber, 3lber and a bunch of smaller ones. Got them dialled in. Now for pike in the spring on the lake. Hopefully next year will see more fishing for me. Lew, we still have to get out and chase some bigguns next year."
823463,chris.brock,2013-12-10 22:36:00,4053,"cool that you posted the pic of the ski when it wasn't cooperating, it shows the real girth of that giant  you look like you mean business, I wouldn't want to tick you off (Hahaha)  nice fish"
