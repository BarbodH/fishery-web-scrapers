823015,atvaholic,2013-12-09 00:51:00,271,"Hey Just got a new 10'6 Steelhead Rod after my son Stepped on my old Fenwick chrome killer  Was looking around for a case that would house my rod and reel setup. Even better if I can keep two in there.  Local Fish Shop only has the tubes, but I'd like something to hold the whole setup, reel included. But nobody seems to have one around here.  Does anybody know where I might find one? Broken down length is 65 inches."
823027,dave524,2013-12-09 01:41:00,4508,Thin walled pvc pipe cut to length and a couple of test caps
823033,atvaholic,2013-12-09 01:57:00,271,Yeah I thought about that. But i'd need a pretty thick diameter PVC pipe to keep the reel attached. And i'd like to have 2 rods setup.

823040,BillM,2013-12-09 02:18:00,17367,"You're best bet is going to be a flyrod case, but it really depends on where your reel is positioned on your float rod.  I think a better idea would be to keep it in the closet out of reach of the little ones"
823088,porkpie,2013-12-09 11:46:00,2521,"I've found that longer 2 piece rods are troublesome to find a rod/reel cae for, and when you do they are quite expensive.  I would just try to keep it out of the way.  I have been fortunate so far and my youngster hasn't wrecked any fishing gear yet!"
823094,cuzza,2013-12-09 12:24:00,467,"Sail have some reasonably priced rod/reel cases that would probably work (think the spey ones are blue) but like Bill says, it depends on your reel position, if you have it near the bottom like a spey rod , it'll work if you have it near the top, it might not fit."

823100,Ralph Field,2013-12-09 13:50:00,1018,I bought a case that will hold my 13' rod and reel at Lambeth Rod & Tackle for around $40.
