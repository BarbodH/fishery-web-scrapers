823029,Handlebarz,2013-12-09 01:49:00,3790,Well last Monday Canada lost another vet of WWII my uncle Leo Cleary passed away he was 92. As a kid every trip to Nova Scotia I was lucky to spend time with him fishing different creeks or my favourite spot he called the bog it had lots of trout in it but was a chore to walk through. I still remember the old bridge I caught my first ever fish from it was made of old railroad ties and had the tar smell but lots of fish. I learned how to cast a fly rod in his driveway and remember getting tangled with  the cloths line he had lots of Patients for me with it.  I never knew much of the war stuff until a few years ago from dad telling me as uncle Leo did not talk about it. I did not see or talk to him much in the last 15 years or so but have a life time of memories from my child hood that I owe to him. RIP uncle Leo.  If you care to please click the link and listen to a short 4:30 of his WWII journey to give us the freedom we have today. From being a  POW to getting shot after the war was over he gave his all for us all.  http://www.thememoryproject.com/stories/1684:charles-leo-cleary/

823192,Handlebarz,2013-12-09 22:19:00,3790,Thanks all he was a tough guy and always busy even last summer at 91 years young was up on the roof painting the windows even though his kids would give him crap he just did his thing. I wish he would have talked about more stories like what happened when he was a POW I have heard some from dad but they will be shared face to face to graphic to post here. I can just imagine what went through all our vets minds daily to help them selves keep living with there memories most of us would not be able to handle them.
