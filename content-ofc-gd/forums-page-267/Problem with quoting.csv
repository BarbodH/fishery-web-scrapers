823482,muskymatt,2013-12-10 23:49:00,2608,I have had issues for a while now. Internet explorer is what I'm using. Haven't tried a different browser yet

823489,leaf4,2013-12-11 00:00:00,2466,well there's yer problem! ie is the worst
823491,aplumma,2013-12-11 00:02:00,6896,So far it is just IE that is having the issue. We are trying to find out if it is all IE or just certain versions.    Art
823493,GBW,2013-12-11 00:06:00,8460,since my PC forced an upgrade or two ago and upgraded me to IE11 I cannot quote.  It could be a SP the PC did BUT I bet it's an IE11 thing...
823500,leaf4,2013-12-11 00:26:00,2466,"get Firefox or chrome, both free and excellent browsers also a lot less of a security risk IMO than IE, and faster"
823501,GBW,2013-12-11 00:32:00,8460,"I have used them before and thanks.  If I do anything it will be Google.  I don't really need to quote someone.  Unless it's a ""small piece of worthless crap, a decorative knick knack with little or no purpose""."

Thanks   Art   hit F12 in IE and you can set the browser mode to act like previous versions, might help with the problem?
