821246,GBW,2013-11-30 02:35:00,8460,"tks CH312, I may have to yank either the fridge OR freezer out soon and start working on one.  Yeah, I have the old fridge I mentioned AND an old upright freezer I can use too...   Oh the joy's when I'm done in the basement...  Oh yeah, that's a lot of work to still do 1st but I WILL make a new smoker! I think that having a master____ (what ever brand I got from BPS) propane smoker should make it a bit better for keeping the temps low as the unit I have for a burner was never a side unit.  It was the primary from a propane smoker.  Worst case, I blow the stuff up....  LOL!  KIDDING, sort of..."
821252,nancur373,2013-11-30 03:05:00,1211,I think a burner from a trailer stove top would work great as you can turn it down to damned near nothing.
822514,ch312,2013-12-06 20:27:00,1590,"I did my first turkey yesterday as a test run so I don't ruin christmas dinner for the family and it turned out far better than expected.  I liquid brined the bird for two days before smoking it at 250 f for 5 1/2 hours until the internal temperature of the thigh reached 163 f. I then removed the bird and tented it with foil for 20-25 minutes which brought the temps up to 167 in the thigh and 170 in the breast.  Tender, very juicy, and very flavorful. I'll no longer be able to choke down the dried out turkey that needs a pool of gravy to be edible that so many people cook. I simply didn't know what I was missing!  "
822516,nancur373,2013-12-06 20:44:00,1211,That bird looks delish. Gotta get me an old fridge
822526,Richie Razor,2013-12-06 21:28:00,536,Wow looks real good!
822535,Big Cliff,2013-12-06 22:09:00,6899,"That does look fantastic! We started using a wet brine on our turkey a couple of years ago. I usually just brine mine over night but the difference is huge, I find they usually cook a little faster when brined too."
822588,GBW,2013-12-07 01:54:00,8460,"wow ch312, it looks SO good!  I hope to start on mine (convert fridge to smoker) in the new year as I cannot get it out of the basement on my own.  Well, I might be able to but I don't want to damage the house too much...  LOL"
822660,ch312,2013-12-07 18:59:00,1590,"That does look fantastic! We started using a wet brine on our turkey a couple of years ago. I usually just brine mine over night but the difference is huge, I find they usually cook a little faster when brined too.  Brining works from the outside in so giving it another day provides more time for the brine to open up the meat so it can absorb more of the flavored brine. This is the first time I've let it go for two days and we were very happy with the results. You're right, a wet brine does decrease cook times significantly.  The turkey weighed 10.6 lbs with the neck and liver before the brine and 10.8 afterwards without the neck and liver. Likely an increase of 6-8 oz's?  Keep in mind that many store bought turkeys are already brined to increase the weight of the bird around 5%. That's right folks, around 5% of the price you pay for a turkey is for salted water.   wow ch312, it looks SO good!  I hope to start on mine (convert fridge to smoker) in the new year as I cannot get it out of the basement on my own.  Well, I might be able to but I don't want to damage the house too much...  LOL   Mine weighed a ton when I first got it too, but once you remove all the junk you don't need it's weight was almost cut in half. The compressor weighs a ton so you'll be far better off removing that before moving the fridge, but keep in mind the system is full of nasty liquid that's likely unhealthy. Luckily, the guy I got my fridge from emptied it himself so I didn't have to worry about it.  There was maybe 1/4 liter left in the system that poured out while moving it into my yard. Apparently whatever that liquid was is a very effective herbicide as that spot is still completely bare."

822819,GBW,2013-12-08 03:49:00,8460,Ryan that is one TOP NOTCH looking smoker/BBQ that you have.  Well done!  I may take a look at or apart the 1970/1980's up right freezer I have tomorrow after I attempt to get out fishing and see what I can get started on it.  I do what to keep the fridge as an item I want to convert to hold a mini keg with a draft tap and sell it BUT I can 'burn' it up as a smoker too.  I just need to figure out what one works better as a smoker and takes LESS effort from me to modify.

If that turkey didn't convince you to buy or build a smoker, I'm thinking this chunk of pork that we turned into some awesome pulled pork might do it      Rabbit/pork pepperettes (raw, pre smoked) anyone?      The girlfriend made up some stew with leftover turkey and it was amazing with the smoked bird in it. We finished up the rest of the turkey breast yesterday and 4 days after it was cooked it was still juicier than most turkey I've had..."

820229,ch312,2013-11-25 21:22:00,1590,Just wondering who else has made their own smoker and how it worked out. I successfully converted an old all steel fridge into a big smoker that's very efficient due to the insulation which also helps maintain constant temperature and I opted for propane as it's the cheapest to operate and I don't have to mess with any extension cords.  I'll post some pics tomorrow of the unit to possibly help anyone who is considering building one. Total cost was under $75 for a high capacity unit that's able to function all year round. Thanks Kijiji...  The first small chunk of meat that was a test run. It sure didn't last long   
820231,manitoubass2,2013-11-25 21:30:00,11391,"Mmmm looks good!!! Thats essentially the same set up i had until a ""friend"" borrowed it. Probably make another in the spring since we have a spare fridge in storage. Imo it cooks more evenly then other options and is indeed high capacity like you mentioned, win win. Now if i could only get some lakers to smoke lol, i suck at laker fishing"
820233,GBW,2013-11-25 21:39:00,8460,I sure am wanting to know more on the old fridge conversion.  I have an older Westinghouse unit (still works too!) with the snap style door handle.  It's either going to be a mini draft fridge or a propane smoker.  Looking forward to more on this post as I have used and make other smokers (wood frame with electric hotplate) in the past.
820236,manitoubass2,2013-11-25 21:51:00,11391,"Its not hard. And GBW thats the same make of fridge i used my first time. There is really nothing to it, and some air intake near the bottom and a couple exhaust holes at the top. The old style fridges are the way to go"

It's either going to be a mini draft fridge or a propane smoker.  Looking forward to more on this post as I have used and make other smokers (wood frame with electric hotplate) in the past.  Any fridge will work as long as the interior is steel. Plastic leaves a distinct taste on your food and the general consensus is that it's unhealthy to have anything plastic inside the smoking cabinet. Many old fridges have a steel interior that is coated with porcelain which makes it ideal for a smoker, but makes drilling and cutting holes difficult as the porcelain is so hard. Matter of fact, in order for my dewalt hole saws to cut through the steel I had to use a steel punch to chip the porcelain in a circle to expose bare metal so the hole saw could cut it. To drill holes for screws I had to use a punch first to chip off the porcelain. Hard stuff.  With many fridges you'll need to remove some plastic trim on the interior and replace it with sheet metal or aluminum. Many doors are plastic lined so it's common for the entire interior of the door to be replaced with sheet metal.   Permatex red high temp silicone that's found in the auto section at Canadian tire is food safe and perfect for sealing holes. I used this to make a door seal (factory rubber should not be used) by taping it off, applying a heavy bead of silicone to the fridge side, and I used Pam as a release agent so the silicone wouldn't stick to the door when I closed it. The next day I had a perfect seal.   I'm heading out hunting right now and will take some pics when I get home this afternoon."

Bring that sucker out here Geoff, (or I can come and get it if necessary), I just picked up a nice little hotplate at CTC (with the idea of building a smoker, just need a cabnet) so we would have a heat source, I have all the tools we would need to make any holes in it for vents.

820722,Steelheadphycho,2013-11-27 04:53:00,470," I built an ""ugly drum smoker"" using a food grade 55 gallon drum and an old propane grill. The replacement grates for weber charcoal grills fit perfectly inside the I.D. Of the drum. Use nuts and bolts as pegs to hold the grates as shelves. Using a 1 1/2"" hole saw, I put holes in the bottom for air. Placed the propane burner in the bottom of the barrel and cut a sheet steel circle to cover it. Leaving an inch or so around the edges for heat to rise past. Cut an access panel in the side to place hickory chunk and to keep my hydrator full of apple juice. On the lid, I used a scrap brass ball valve from work as a damper to control the air/smoke flow. I'm soaking my iPhone with saliva just describing it!! I found ALOT of info on the web to build this and I have a full fab shop and machine shop at my disposal which makes it easy. Not to mention I come from a long line of technical red necks..... MERICA!"

820772,ch312,2013-11-27 18:08:00,1590,"This is my high capacity high efficiency unit that cost less than $100 to put together. It holds the heat so well that the burner I used raises the temperature too high even when it's on it's lowest setting. To get the flame even lower I had to install a valve between the regulator and burner control which limits the amount of propane even farther.  It looks filthy, but it was spotless and bright white after I scrubbed it twice prior to seasoning the unit. It may have been overkill, but I let it smoke for 24 hours before I used it for the first time.  Painted her up to look purdy...    Chimney with baffle...    This controls the intake baffle that's in the middle under the burner...    The burner with the intake hole beneath. Excuse the mess, I need a bigger drip pan...

With a fridge that holds so much heat it's hard to find a burner that will allow for low temps for smoking cheese, fish, jerky, etc and even this one needs a valve to make the flame smaller than the original BBQ adjustment will allow.  In the picture of the burner you can see an oven rack over top of the burner and this is where the coffee can sits. You put the wood chips in the coffee can which is a perfect container because of the high sides that prevent the wood from catching fire from hanging over the edge. On the rack above this you place a pan full of water which serves a few purposes. It acts as a heat sink to help maintain even temperature, puts moisture into the air to help keep meat moist, and catches the drippings to make the best sauces and gravies around.
