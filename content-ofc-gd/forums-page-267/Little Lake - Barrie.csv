824028,kickingfrog,2013-12-13 14:43:00,8333,"With the weather the last few weeks it is quite likely that the ice is starting off very nice (always check for yourself) and relatively safe for foot travel and a permeant hut on the smaller lakes. However, given the type of weather we've had in the last 20 years (huge temp swings and green Christmases) in central Ontario I would be hesitant to put out and a permanent hut at this point."
824033,Fisherman,2013-12-13 15:11:00,7201,They've been out there for over 2 weeks already.
824076,davey buoy,2013-12-13 20:14:00,5505,"I myself find no fun having to watch where I step because the ice may be safe,That lake freezes early,be carefull everyone,I can wait a bit."

824101,Terry,2013-12-13 22:23:00,14456,"no  the heaviest person should lead, if the lightest person  walks out  all everyone knows is the ice is safe for him if the heaviest person tests the ice we know it's safe for all in the group"
824103,Freshtrax,2013-12-13 22:39:00,2215,Forget little lake....here is the view from orillia looking south.....ice as far as the eye can see.   Although only 1/4 inch thick.  But it's a start
