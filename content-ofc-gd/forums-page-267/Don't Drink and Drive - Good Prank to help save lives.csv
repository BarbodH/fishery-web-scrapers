823669,Big Cliff,2013-12-11 18:04:00,6899,"Saddly some people just don't get it no matter what you do! After the third DUI (three strikes and you our out) he should have been put in jail for 10 years. How could he even get a license after the second one?  If they ever make the punishements suitable to the crime, there will be a lot less crime."
