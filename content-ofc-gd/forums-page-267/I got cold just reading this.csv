823336,fishindevil,2013-12-10 11:23:00,6254,"wow !!!!! ya thats a little on the brisk side for sure lew !!!!1....cold enough to freeze a dog to a fire hydrant .....i could not even imagine that...i have been in -50 and that was dam right scary,so that temp just seems insane....."
823338,lew,2013-12-10 11:36:00,12766,-35F is probably my coldest Shawn and that was enough for me.  Couldn't imagine  another 100 degrees colder than that
823348,Roy,2013-12-10 12:53:00,13728,"Think of the bright side.....we'd never have an argument about safe ice with those temps. The only place you'd find 1.5"" of ice would be on your coffee."
823350,Fish Farmer,2013-12-10 13:00:00,2234,I think it was that temp at Quinte out in the boat sitting for hours watching my rod telling myself any min. now.
823351,Squid,2013-12-10 13:04:00,1656,Wow three minutes to live in those temps!
823353,Terry,2013-12-10 13:15:00,14456,Lol
823359,bigugli,2013-12-10 13:51:00,6138,At -35 the handle bars froze off the MWO's moustache . Colder than -40 and your spit freezes in mid air before hitting the ground. You hear it pop. At -50 exposed skin will suffer from frostbite in 2 minutes  This was learnt from a week's arctic orientation up on Hudson's Bay
823363,Big Cliff,2013-12-10 14:25:00,6899,I was up in White River back in the late 70's apparently it got down to -72Â°F (I didn't have a thermometer with me) tires were flat on the cars (or nearly) if you could get your car to start the wheels didn't want to turn. That was more than cold enough for me!
823382,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-10 15:56:00,10439,"HMMMMMMMM, about 5 degrees warmer than it is here right now!!!!!"
823388,Joey,2013-12-10 16:48:00,9122,"We used to get -50 when I was a kid in Flin Flon, Manitoba all the time.  Still had to walk to school.  Nobody closed down, it was business as usual.  I used to wrap a thin scarf around my face and the hood of my snowsuit so when I walked I would still see somewhat.  Maybe that's why I don't mind ice fishing, it's not really that cold down here"
823389,mercman,2013-12-10 16:49:00,7054,:)Is it a DRY cold Dave???
823390,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-10 16:53:00,10439,:)Is it a DRY cold Dave???  Yep. Nice and dry.
823405,lew,2013-12-10 17:55:00,12766," Yep. Nice and dry.  My dad grew up in Saskatchewan and always talked about 40 below in the winter, but said you never noticed the cold because it was dry......ya right, 40 below is 40 below"
823414,Acountdeleted,2013-12-10 18:59:00,2562,"I still say Edmonton was colder last week.  Agree with Lew. -35 with wind, there were sometimes last week I don't know how I lasted more then 5 minutes."
823418,SirCranksalot,2013-12-10 19:23:00,3291,.  I used to wrap a thin scarf around my face and the hood of my snowsuit   Wimp!!
823419,SirCranksalot,2013-12-10 19:24:00,3291," My dad grew up in Saskatchewan and always talked about 40 below in the winter, but said you never noticed the cold because it was dry......ya right, 40 below is 40 below  Yeah, right. It rained a lot where I grew up but, yunno, it was a dry rain!!!"
823448,aplumma,2013-12-10 21:26:00,6896," My dad grew up in Saskatchewan and always talked about 40 below in the winter, but said you never noticed the cold because it was dry......ya right, 40 below is 40 below  Funny they say the same crap here about heat. It gets to be 102F and they ask is it a dry heat? The theory of dry heat is you can sweat faster with less resistance so you it feels cooler.   Art"
823449,misfish,2013-12-10 21:33:00,29133,"The wind is the killer in the cold,along with dampness. Last Saturday,it was blowing and frigg,n cold. Thought the day was going to be misserable. Once we arrived at our spot. No wind,same temp. No dampness. It was a pleasureable day.   Ya,lets get those -20 dry temps here,and there will be no arguments about safe ice."

823698,aplumma,2013-12-11 21:24:00,6896, Isn't a welding torch dry heat too? Very dry it is scorched air so the humidity is 0. The ability to evaporate is greater the further you are from 100% humidity. See when you exercise you  and generate body heat which you bleed off by sweating. A person who is at 50% humidity will have a slick or small beads of sweat while the same person will have sweat all over themselves at 75% humidity. The cooling effect is the evaporation not in the actual sweating. It is possible to be in a high humidity place and have heat stroke.( overdressed in the winter). You also can have heat stroke in a dry place if your body can not cool off by evaporation.   Art
