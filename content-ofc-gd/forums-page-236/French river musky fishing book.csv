854499,chris.brock,2014-05-21 04:10:00,4053,"I have a pretty good collection of Ontario fishing and paddling books and I don't think the book you're looking for exists.  this isn't likely what your looking for, but my favorite muskie book is ""A Compendium of Muskie Angling History"" by Larry Ramsell, some fascinating stuff in there"
854509,Rich Clemens,2014-05-21 09:26:00,3131,"One option may be Dick Pearson's. ""Muskies on the Shield"".   He has published both a book and DVD on Canadian Shield musky fishing.  Not specific to the French River, but may be some similar structure and techniques."
854511,musky666,2014-05-21 09:54:00,126,"Re-reading the Pearson book now, details Canadian 'shield' lakes and I imagine the french is similar in nature to that. Talks about classic Musky structure- points, reefs, spines and saddles but he is a big proponent of current in lakes- either wind induced or natural. I haven't been to the French yet, but I would think any obvious structure like I mentioned, and current breaks- back eddies etc could hold fish."

854580,SuperDave,2014-05-21 20:59:00,204,JUst summing up my French River muskie fishing over last15 years or so. You are not alone LOL
854581,BillM,2014-05-21 21:04:00,17367,The French definitely isn't a place to go for a confidence boost.
854584,mistaredone,2014-05-21 21:08:00,913,Lmao!

He was researching fish in Lake Baptiste. Great stories."
854663,farsider,2014-05-22 12:22:00,456,"Save up and take a guide.  Great way to learn from someone who successfully fishes the body of water with greater regularity  Andy Pappas is a great guy and worth your time.  http://www.viciousfishes.ca/  Cheers, Mark"
854680,bigcreekdad,2014-05-22 14:51:00,546,"If you fishing the Wolesey Bay area, I can recommend a good muskie guide."
854778,trevy727,2014-05-22 23:54:00,351,Not interested in a guide thanks. I've done okay for musky up there but I'm really going to start targeting them this year. I've fished the water from Hartley bay to the rapids for years but The wife and I bought a cabin on the east side of hwy 69 on the French last spring so it's all new water to us but we have many years to figure it out. Thanks
