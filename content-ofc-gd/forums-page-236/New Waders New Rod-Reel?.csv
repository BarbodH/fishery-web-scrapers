Waders:  1. I want to spend $120-$200 max, should I go stocking foot or boot included, I've had two pairs before, last one was White River, lasted 2 yrs before leaking, I understand they will all leak anyway, any suggestions?  Rod/Reel:  2. I have a Shimano Sedona 2500, want to spend under $100 for the reel, what do I fish? Mainly rivers, wading, mainly bass and catfish, mainly 0.5lb to 5lb, I want to keep it light. For a rod, i'm thinkin another 7ft medium light. Should I combine, or to get good gear, must I buy rod and reel separate, would like to spend $150 on rod/reel. Basspro guy was trying to sell me Sedona 4000 (don't want to go bigger) and a bionic rod (BassPro brand), not sure about that, that's why i left lol  I checked kijijji in London, but not much happening, not sure if I want to buy used stuff.  Any help appreciated."
