I fished a couple of lakes around the Kawarthas and Bancroft this weekend. Water ranged from 52 up to 61 (average in the main lakes I fished was about 55) on most of the lakes depending on how deep they were and where you were. I saw some bass on the beds in the warmer shallow bays, but very little growth on the weed front compared to other years, we'll have to see how everything ramps up. Just my few observations."
