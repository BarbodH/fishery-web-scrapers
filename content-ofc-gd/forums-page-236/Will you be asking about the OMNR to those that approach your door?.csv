854976,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-24 09:04:00,8243,"In keeping with the original question I have sent off a email to my MPP here. I copied Gerritt's original question and supplied the link for this thread for him and his fellow colleagues to read and more importantly respond to Gerritt's original question. What are your plans as well as the PC parties plans for the MNR in Ontario? Of course we will get a very well thought out response but it will be interesting to hear what he says, if he responds, I believe he will, Toby Barrett is the only politician I can believe when he says something. Yes much easier to do when sitting on the left side of the house.  Now if I may my 3 cents of politics, never have a chance to talk it here at home, actually my rule, need to change it.  After carefully reading the responses here, which are very, very interesting, I told my esteemed member of Parliament that it would be prudent for him to carefully read the responces here and have his entire party candidates as well as Hudac to read it too. This thread is a better indication of the climate of the working class Ontarian (unless you are a professional that needs an accountant to keep track of your earnings you are working class not middle class folks). Better indication than any Ipsis-Reid pole.  How in heavens name does a very young black Jr. Senator with a millisecond of political experience, with of all things a Muslim sounding name during a war waged against predominantly Muslims defeat, soundly I may add, a lifelong seasoned politico, Wasp, God fearing, south western, likeable and a freakin' war hero to boot? Not only once but twice.  How? He did it by convincing slightly over 1% of the population that never votes or voted to vote for him. 21 year old students of all races, colours and creeds, disenfranchised visible minorities and those at very low income that never vote, and those that lost faith in the political system that gave up a long time ago, that's how. It ain't rocket science, it's political science though, and a brilliant strategy politicians were to frightened to push the start button on. But that's a discussion for another day on another forum.  If you want Hamilton Hannah Horwath, I call her triple ""H"", as your next Premier, be my guest go ahead and spoil your ballot as a protest, or don't vote, that's your right. Remember no one voted for McGuinty either. Remember Bobby "" Ray Days"" Rea's meteoric rise to power. We woke one morning after election day and had an left leaning socialist oriented NDP Premier in the bosom of Canada's business sector. How'd dat happin' Joe? No one voted for the guy, no one voted against him either.  Complain all you want, you pay taxes that's your right too, I've read that here too, but don't dare complain to me.  Don't worry Big Cliff, triple H is as straight as Bill Clinton. I used to tip a few with her (then) boyfriend at a time she was my city councillor at his bar on James Street.  Protest all you want but be careful when you do it by spoiling a ballot."
854742,Rod Caster,2014-05-22 20:04:00,5784,"Actually, spoiling a vote is a tangible action, not voting is a non-action. Spoiling means a lot more than not voting at all and  is the best way to say that you are not pleased with our current political options.  I'm just making sure people know there is another option on the ballot."
854744,cram,2014-05-22 20:09:00,1733,"This is getting slightly off topic ...but there is more to this issue within society than should I vote for Nutty or Nuttier?  Within many of our lifetimes there has been a huge social change---sometimes so gradual--hard to notice--- but still there  1st---it's now a smaller world where we are competing for $$$ and jobs with a tipped set of scales---we are having difficulty competing--in an exploding world population  Essentially removing our once content middle class---leaving us with Very rich and almost poverty for the most sake (middle is still there but falling fast)  Now Whatever Gov't is in place can't change the wall streets of the world---Remember Regan saying you don't tell the head of Exxon what to do>  So when our wages get shipped to a cheaper source----tax revenues fall for Gov'ts to waste----cuts are a comin  This can go on but thinking that one party can change your life or livelihood for the better----would'nt want to tread water waiting Is the middle class really disappearing, or is it just changing?  We are losing manufacturing jobs for sure.....but I see a lot of middle class people in software and IT jobs.  It's a different economy now.  No one (including Hudak) is bringing manufacturing back to Ontario. At least not in a big way."
854745,bigugli,2014-05-22 20:15:00,6138,"I have involved myself in the political process since I have been old enough to vote. I vote religiously, I have campaigned, written party literature and speeches, worked as part of the electoral process at all 3 levels of government. I am having a hard time this go around. To many lies from all sides. Not one leader with any real skill, potential or vision. A whole lot of waste and greed. Far too many political dynasties that have controlled policy in this province for decades, and they are not interested in listening to John Q Public. No one party gives a hoot about the MNR, unless it pertains to winning urban votes. On the topic of a spoiled or declined ballot... They only really take note of these irregularities during a close/ contentious/ appealed vote."
854746,bushart,2014-05-22 20:15:00,2628,I think we have arrived at that feeling of helplessness------we turn to our gov't for leadership and vision---to make our lives better---for the $$$ we contribute  We get less though now and pay more---and as in this election----we seem to be drowning and none of them have a rope to throw to us  I look at the ballot and It looks like a question----Do you want to be clubbed in the head---the stomach --or the knees?  None of the options are very appealing

Spoiling means a lot more than not voting at all and is the best way to say that you are not pleased with our current political options.  I'm just making sure people know there is another option on the ballot.  Yeah... an option to let someone else choose.  The winner won't care, the loser might look at it and wish he had those but there is nothing to say who you are what you believe or what you want.   Think that those in favour of ""Occupy"" or Sharia etc. will spoil their chance???  Hitler was awhile ago... how about just a couple years ago    In Egypt the Muslim Brother hood and Morsi got in by 3% on a 54% turnout...... then promptly trying to impose a Muslim state through violence, laws etc. until the military stepped in.  The real middle class is doing OK when you look at the statistical middle group,  the problem is where do you draw the line on ""middle"" class.  Justin Trudeau called it anyone living pay cheque to pay cheque, Sun news brought in economists and showed the middle %s and how they have changed etc.   Take a look at the difference.... LIEbrals have doubled our provincial debt, want to increase our electricity rates by 42% and pull another 1.5% off your pay rather than leaving it for you to pay your mortgage, credit cards etc.   If you can't see a benefit then you are looking at personality and Hudak is a wet noddle true but you had better take a look at the policies.  Ontario ALONE now has twice the debt as the Ukraine or to put it individually about $20,000 PER person."

854764,irishfield,2014-05-22 22:07:00,26272,Good thing this thread is about saving the MNR.. otherwise it would be a political thread!
854786,JimC,2014-05-23 00:18:00,86," Sorry, the way I read it made me think you fit in with the slackers.  They tick me off and just don't seem to have any clue about history or what is at stake in voting.  We have people in Canada that would vote for a politician that supported Sharia law, and considering the money given to the charity that was supporting Hamas there are many,support UN policies (just a note, Iran is on Women's rights council etc.) and on and on.  I think this picture sums it up best, Benjamin Levin, Justin Trudeau and Kathleen Wynn, the media usually leaves out Benjamin  Benjamin Levin, education advisor for the Liberal party under Wynne who was Minister of Educaiton and part of her transition team when she came to power - Levin is charged with multiple child porn charges and arranging to meet with a girl under 16.  Justin Trudeau admitted and unapologetic illegal drug user that wants to legalize mj many liberals spoke/voted against raising the age of consent for sex from 14 to 16 (Levin would have been OK on those charged,not the child porn, before unless the girl was under 14) wants to repeal the mandatory sentences wants to repeal election bill that would require a person voting to supply an ID admires China's dictatorship won't allow pro-life or those that don't support man made global warming to be liberal candidates etc.etc.  Kathleen Wynn education Minister that was in power when the new curriculum was created and then abandoned after parents saw it and started protesting. in cabinet during gas plants etc yet knows nothing about it ????? has someone wandering around her office formatting hard drives and knows nothing about it wants to increase electricity rates by 42% wants to increase payroll deduction (individual and company) for a new pension plan.  Talks about CPP yet that is a small fraction of most pensions. Estimated another 100,000 jobs to leave Ontario etc. etc.     Edit:  posting in a new comment"
854787,JimC,2014-05-23 00:20:00,86,"mosquito,  this is just so 'on the money' that I'm re-quoting it.    Very well said, and you covered all the bases."

I do hope that whomever forms the next government will do what is needed to protect the critical fishing resource we have enjoyed, and our families have enjoyed during our lifetime.   It IS important,  and all we can do is fight the good fight.  Now ... let's GO FISHIN"
854792,mosquito,2014-05-23 01:06:00,111,"Yeah, I think I made my point, now let's get back to the MNR /environment.....I planned on talking and now am sending an email to the local candidates, I was by the candidates PC office today but there was no one there today.  Other than what will be the cutback criteria,  management efficiencies (Smoky Thomas “There’s probably 60,000 too many middle managers in the entire Public Service”??....will it be aimed at recent hires (the liberals increased the public servant count by almost 100,000 since they came into power) or early retirement?  Here is what I have but besides that what I want to know what are the main points here?  1) Lack of funding for field officers to enforce the existing laws.  Poachers, polluters, .... 2) Inconsistent enforcement especially among the reserves ( in case you missed it http://www.wiartonecho.com/2014/04/30/fishing-altercation-at-colpoys-bay and I have heard many stories but have nothing to back them up so won't go there) 3) Invasive species funding (lamprey spraying) 4) Stocking priorities  (based on scientists?

""Grump"" yeah that seems to fit if you are actually serious... either that or you are a Wynne/ Trudeau Liberal with their aversion to free speech.  The Liberals spent billions of dollars on windmills, gas plants, coverups..... and you are comparing it to a sarcastic post....   Just so you have some exposure to reality....    and MacKay often has a good one...  "
854811,bigugli,2014-05-23 03:29:00,6138,"Not confused at all. I despise all politicians. Hence my direct participation in the electoral process. Someone has to try and make sure they play fair. As for the mock ad, that's all fine until you put it up as an election ad. I merely pointed out the problem as a responsible voter. Don't be surprised if someone brought it to the attention of Elections Ontario. I've seen heavy handed responses for far more trivial breaches of ""political etiquette' during elections."
854819,big guy,2014-05-23 05:16:00,414,"To Mosquito, don't lump me in with the slackers, I worked at elections for 11 years, delivered every general and by-election from 2003 to 2011, at the provincial level, not just one riding. I know more about the electoral process than anyone on this board, working between 30 and 35 days straight to make sure people were able to exercise their franchise. I am out of that game now though and while I still care that we are able to vote democratically, my focus has changed.  People have a right to vote or not to vote, it's that simple. It just boils down to what choice does a person have, I really don't see one out there that I can hang my hat on. Im not going to put their pictures on the dart board and decide that way, if I don't believe in something, feel strongly about it, I don't do it. Perhaps something will resonate with me over the next couple of weeks, but right now the thing I feel most strongly about is either spoiling my ballot, or not voting at all."
854821,Gerritt,2014-05-23 08:34:00,6129,"Ok...... Can we get back to my original question? Given the divide and given the lack of options, if one candidate said they would stand up, help to rebuild the OMNR..... Would you vote for that person/party?  Given this is political, I never meant this to become a political debate. I simply wanted to know if there could be a way to have our votes have ANY meaning in regards to the sport/life we all care deeply about...  The louder we are as sportsmen.... The more they have to listen to us. It seems as though we have done a terrible job, compared to other "" interest"" groups.  So my question remains, would you give your vote to someone that wants to preserve your heritage and birthright....  We are no different, we have Grown up, hunting, fishing and trapping. Or are you willing to stand by idle and let those that make the rule stomp on what you, and your family have done for generations?  I think it is time we say enough is enough...  I feel we do have a choice.... We have been Been crapped on far too long from our elected. Have you ever watched a sitting of parliament?  Worse then the bullies in highschool... No wonder we get nowhere....  I think as a collective something can and should be done. A strong voice from our own ""special"" interest group.... Once they know votes against them in the thousands I bet we would be heard.  Surely this is how OFHA started..... And we all know how that worked out.....  G"

My dad took me fishing on Lake Nipissing, 60yrs ago,  and I've been hooked (no pun intended) ever since.   I've tried to expose my son and daughter to this great sport as well, and we've actually had 33 wonderful family vacations at a Lake Nipissing Camp,  since them.

When you hear the people whining about the 100,000 job cuts remind them about two facts...  1) The cuts would put put them numbers back where they were before the LIbErals (current politicians in power, not related to individual Liberals) were in power.  * Name LIbErals directly tied to Gas Plants, eHealth, Wind Turbines...  2) Even Smokey Thomas, head of the Ontario Public Service Employee Union said “There’s probably 60,000 too many middle managers in the entire Public Service” , they showed the clip on Sun news and he even went on to talk about a department with 11 workers and 8 managers. The upper manager probably didn't want to reduce his head count of direct reports.  Then if they persist, there is always the Gas Plants, formatting hard drives, eHealth, contracts to insiders on Wind Turbines, 42% projected increase in electric bill, The creation of committee after committee (atleast 20 new ones..) and we know how much work a committee does.....  3) The debt under the LIbErals has almost doubled.  4) forcing through many of the over 6,700 approved wind turbines (Some are actually considered hazards by transport Canada...  look at the Chatham airport.) http://www.windontario.ca/  Next time you drive up the Bruce Peninsula think they are planning another 250 north of Wiarton!

Why?   Because Tim Hudak's right-hand-man,  Vic Fedeli (MPP-Nipissing)  will personally champion this cause.   The ineffective OMNR has been on his radar screen for a long long time,  and he definitely has the leader's ear.   I also believe Vic would be a front runner to lead the party, if and when Mr. Hudak steps aside.

Besides, once an election is over and the winner determined, majority or minority, when has it done any good to complain? It's like complaining about the weather, no one is listening.   Not voting or spoiling a vote is just the same as voting for the worst of them is my way of looking at it, you aren't helping to make a change so it would take more than a bit of a hypocrisy to complain.  We know the current gov't has almost doubled the provincial debt, added over 100,000 new public servants, lied over and over, put lives in danger according to Transport Canada with their windmills, given huge subsidies to the windmills and plans on building thousands more, given huge contracts to insiders, had a education advisor up on child porn charges, will increase our electricity rates by over 40% in the next few years, wants to add another deduction to payrolls that is estimated to drive another 100,000 jobs out of the province on top of 250,000 that already left in 10 years etc. etc.  so if you can't find someone better you are just lazy or don't care is what I see!  Vote Conservative, Green, independent, NDP, put yourself on the ballot or if you have a good LIEbral candidate even them but not voting or spoiling seems to just be more a sign you don't care who is in charge and your right to complain means less than nothing. It is worse, you are leaving it up to those with an agenda that is probably exactly the opposite to what you would want.   I know many that will vote LIEberal because of the Unions, media, etc. groups like Greenpeace, P.E.T.A., etc etc. understand this and spend millions on fear mongering and rhetoric and not voting and not talking to your rep. is just letting them win by default!  There are often MPs put in place by less than 100 votes so 100 slackers not voting or spoiling their ballot is a waste. So do you think that those that support P.E.T.A. or Greenpeace etc. will not vote and anyone will actually pay attention to spoiled votes when a gov't is picked... dream on!"

The Liberals suck, the NDP suck, but it was also the PC that began the cuts against the MNR many years ago as well, which is what started this thread to begin with. Not much to choose from.  I don't complain about politics, and only appeared on this thread to outline another option about dealing with your ballot if one chooses to vote. I don't talk politics, or religion for that matter in my home, because both are a colossal waste of time and breath.

Last winter I called our local PC office and asked what plans they had in place to help the seniors that were put in a prediciment over heat/food. Not their problem, call the United Way! Has our society reduced itself to a system where when the goverment has taken everything they can and we are forced to starve or freeze, we should go to food banks or charities?  Who is left to vote for? The Green Party; PITA? The NDP (remember Bob Rae). We are screwed no matter how we vote, thank god I am not going to be around much longer to have to deal with this and when you think about it; that is really sad!"

Justin Trudeau admitted and unapologetic illegal drug user that wants to legalize mj many liberals spoke/voted against raising the age of consent for sex from 14 to 16 (Levin would have been OK on those charged,not the child porn, before unless the girl was under 14) wants to repeal the mandatory sentences wants to repeal election bill that would require a person voting to supply an ID admires China's dictatorship won't allow pro-life or those that don't support man made global warming to be liberal candidates etc.etc.  Kathleen Wynn education Minister that was in power when the new curriculum was created and then abandoned after parents saw it and started protesting. in cabinet during gas plants etc yet knows nothing about it ????? has someone wandering around her office formatting hard drives and knows nothing about it wants to increase electricity rates by 42% wants to increase payroll deduction (individual and company) for a new pension plan.  Talks about CPP yet that is a small fraction of most pensions. Estimated another 100,000 jobs to leave Ontario etc. etc.  "

Since I have been a voter (and I ALWAYS exercise my right to vote), it seems we go back and forth between Liberal and PC.  Liberal has got to be better than PC and will fix everything, not wait, that didn't work.  Okay PC has got to be better than Liberal and they'll fix everything.  Damn, that didn't work either.  And even if they don't or can't fix everything, they can barely fix one thing.  The complete waste of our taxpayers' money is so out of hand it is beyond repair.  Overthrow the government has been my inside joke lately!!! Is that what it has to come to???  There are really only 2 choices out there and the majority dislike both.  NDP and Green will never work so you are right in asking, who do we vote for.  If we don't vote we're screwed, yet if we do vote, we're screwed!!!"

Within many of our lifetimes there has been a huge social change---sometimes so gradual--hard to notice--- but still there  1st---it's now a smaller world where we are competing for $$$ and jobs with a tipped set of scales---we are having difficulty competing--in an exploding world population  Essentially removing our once content middle class---leaving us with Very rich and almost poverty for the most sake (middle is still there but falling fast)  Now Whatever Gov't is in place can't change the wall streets of the world---Remember Regan saying you don't tell the head of Exxon what to do>  So when our wages get shipped to a cheaper source----tax revenues fall for Gov'ts to waste----cuts are a comin  This can go on but thinking that one party can change your life or livelihood for the better----would'nt want to tread water waiting

I stopped him and asked what they plan to due to help an underfunded ministry branch that has become nothing but a slush fund for the current government, with nothing but cut backs on services...

They marched up the driveway, interrupted my lawn work and immediately began to lecture me at full volume on why Tim Hudak is evil and not to be trusted. When I finally managed to get a word in edgewise, I told them I feel their entire party belongs in jail, and told them if they weren't off my lawn by the time I reached the front door, they would soon meet a very large dog. Thankfully, they took the hint and left quickly - which was a good thing, since we don't have a dog.  Conservative candidate came around the day after. Politely introduced herself and asked if she could speak with me for a few minutes about her party's platform. She gave me a pamplet, kept it short and to the point, then wrapped up by asking what issues were important to me.  Where the two Liberals were loud and shrill, she was polite, and listened as much as she talked. So she will get my vote, if for nothing more than just treating me with some respect and taking the time to ask what I felt might be important.

You can 'Decline' a ballot, which is a vote for non-of-the-above and shows your disatisfaction with the current choices.  Declined ballot 53. An elector who has received a ballot and returns it to the deputy returning officer declining to vote, forfeits the right to vote and the deputy returning officer shall immediately write the word “declined” upon the back of the ballot and preserve it to be returned to the returning officer and shall cause an entry to be made in the poll record that the elector declined to vote. R.S.O. 1990, c. E.6, s. 53.“  I wish this was advertised along with every campaign ad. Honestly, I'm considering voting for 'none of the above' and hoping more people do it. Elections Canada should better educate people that this is an option.  In Nipissing riding in 2012, only 12 people declined their vote."

Until a week or so ago he was running uncontested until a Lib, I think, haven't seen anything from that person via any campaigning, decided to loose whatever the fee was to toss the name into the hat. Toby hasn't been able to do anything much here since he's on the wrong side of the aisle but does what he can to be sure. I need to ask him though about Mr. Hudaks plan to create 1 million jobs. If the first thing he want's to do to achieve that is to cut 100,000 public service jobs first, I would call that something a US Presidential candidate once called "" fuzzy math "".  I need to take a ride this week to see Toby. If you have a question or something you want addressed you go to his home and knock on the door. If you have another driver along, you are sure to be offered a cold one and have a seat on the deck or by the fire in winter, winter as in last month. Hopefully the DD driver doesn't live in Haldimand-Norfolk because no beer no vote. Insert smiley face here.  Note: during the Native goings on (riots) in Caledonia, Toby was the only politician that had enough balls to cross the barricades and meet with the warriors. He was there almost everyday until the roads were opened. That impressed me."
854654,JimC,2014-05-22 10:47:00,86,"Great story, Ironmaker ... your MPP,  PC Toby Barrett is a shining example of what we wish all our elected representatives would be like.  Sadly, not always the case.  Regarding the subject of this thread,  I truly believe there is hope for a renewed and more effective OMNR,  IF the Progressive Conservatives are able to win a majority. Why?   Because Tim Hudak's right-hand-man,  Vic Fedeli (MPP-Nipissing)  will personally champion this cause.   The ineffective OMNR has been on his radar screen for a long long time,  and he definitely has the leader's ear.   I also believe Vic would be a front runner to lead the party, if and when Mr. Hudak steps aside.  Regarding the famous 100,000 job ""cuts"" ....the shrill protests we hear daily  from the Libs and their buddies, the public sector union bosses [aka Working Families], and the usual Conservative hating mainstream media types,  never acknowledge that Hudak has said time and time again that these 'cuts' will almost entirely be made up of attrition by NOT replacing redundant, civil servants, many of which are middle management positions.   Few, if any will actually lose their jobs.   What will be lost is some future Union Dues, and no one wants to see that happen, right?!  I say, give Hudak ONE chance to turn this Ontario Titantic around;  that's what my wife and I plan to do.  I just hope its not too late."

There have been enough environmental and MNR issues for him to face here in his backyard. Hudak's track record... back pedal, sidestep or avoid, unless you have a pet project and money to throw in the ""right"" direction. Just go back to that long thread about 15 mile creek. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=41739&page=6&hl=%2Bmile+%2Bcreek&do=findComment&comment=455461  After an initial positive response, Baby Face and his office did everything possible to avoid that issue. Might have something to do with the big blue sign that was on the lawn. The only reason we got any response at all from his office was because of a very large number of letters and emails that began to flood his office.  On a side note, re the MNR's involvement in this, The ministry made a serious effort to shut down discussion of this matter."
