855067,skinny,2014-05-25 08:21:00,442,ok so I just replaced the wood transom in my boat and the process required me to remove about 3 feet of the floor and some of the foam from the rear of the boat I would like to put the foam back in but not sure where to get it at a cost effective way I dont think buying the cans of spray foam will be cost effective suggestions welcome
855087,vance,2014-05-25 14:55:00,719,"The spray insulation foam will absorb water,what you need is closed cell foam like they use for docks which I know home depot has but you will have to cut it to fit.   vance"
855089,DRIFTER_016,2014-05-25 15:13:00,10439,Talk to your local home insulation guy. Have them spray in some Wall Tight Eco. It is closed cell foam and will not absorb water. The original foam was open cell and it can/will absorb water over time.
855090,Sinker,2014-05-25 15:15:00,8692,Blue foam from home depot will work fine just cut to fit.  S.

855134,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-25 20:30:00,8243,"Closed cell isosytrene foam is what you want. They do sell it at Homeless Despot but call around to a commercial dealer. Tow the boat to them and have it done. The set up they sell at HD is far more than you need, once you start the container it must be finished, like the small cans."
855157,big guy,2014-05-25 23:10:00,414,"Why bother putting foam back in? Foam is only useful if you managed to swamp the boat, which let's face it, is extremely unlikely to happen.  Use the space for storage, dry, battery, build a cooler in there, or a removable baitwell, something useful. I removed the foam out of the middle seat in my Lund to make a dry storage area and a place for my battery and portions of foam from the other two cross seats and built in coolers, using the foam as insulation. Now when I go fishing I have no coolers in the way and the battery and wiring for everything is hidden away, not tripping over stuff."
855167,Sinker,2014-05-26 01:04:00,8692,It only takes one swamping to kill you. Id stick with the foam.  S.
855171,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-26 01:28:00,8243,"The foam acts as a stiffener, not primarily for floatation, others here will know better than I. Slam a wave with a glass hull straight on and you have a chance of splitting her. Or you can save a few bucks and not replace it."
855173,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-26 01:31:00,8243,"big guy, you just voided the lifetime warranty from Lund. Like I said that foam helps stiffen it. Especially in the middle. Want loose rivets or a crack, take out the foam, aluminium as well as glass."
855175,big guy,2014-05-26 01:46:00,414,"No lifetime warranty, im the third owner of the boat, they won't honour any warranty on it.  Boat is strong like bull, got a 25 on it, it will run 27 mph with just me in it, was running 23 mph last night with three of us in it on a very rough Cameron Lake. The boat is 20 years old and doesn't leak a drop, driest boat I've ever seen. I didn't modify anything else about the middle seat regarding supports or the rivets to the hull, can't see how the foam adds so much to the structural integrity that it will cause problems, have had it out 6 years now, still no issues."
