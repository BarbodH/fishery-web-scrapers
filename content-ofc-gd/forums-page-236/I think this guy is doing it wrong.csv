854833,craigdritchie,2014-05-23 12:11:00,1586,I always thought the trailer hooked onto that little ball thingie by the back bumper. Guess not.  
854835,BillM,2014-05-23 12:17:00,17367,There's gotta be something being towed behind that truck right?  RIGHT?!?!?!
854837,Ralph Field,2014-05-23 12:21:00,1018,It would be neat to see how it is launched. Those rails the tires are riding on must slide back. May be prone to roll overs and wind drag would be something else.
854838,Roy,2014-05-23 12:23:00,13728,He probably only has one spot in his apartment building parking. I hope it's not an underground parking. I'd be interested in seeing how he launches the boat.
854839,Mike Pike,2014-05-23 12:30:00,1332,I'm wondering how he even gets it loaded up there.
854840,Steelheadphycho,2014-05-23 12:40:00,470,RED NECK TECH !!!!!!!!!!
854845,outllaw,2014-05-23 12:55:00,1232,he is avoiding toll charges . smart man
854849,ratherboutdoors,2014-05-23 13:17:00,132,"Come on guys, maybe its just that he has trouble backing up a trailer?"
854861,NAW,2014-05-23 14:09:00,4022,"You're all assuming it's a ""he"" behind the wheel.."
854862,grimsbylander,2014-05-23 14:17:00,3016,That's kinda neat. I've always thought about buying a tent trailer but I'm not going anywhere without my boat! Maybe that's his angle?
854867,BillM,2014-05-23 14:36:00,17367,I'm guessing he was hauling two boats or similar.. You can see the rear ball in the pic.
854870,Walleye72,2014-05-23 15:13:00,156,I was thinking maybe the trailer needed repairs and he's taking it to the shop.  He's avoiding using a towing service to save some bucks.  It's definitely an eyecatcher though.
854876,bare foot wader,2014-05-23 15:41:00,1354,"In AB you can pull tandem (leading has to be 5th wheel with min 2 axles, overall length can't exceed 20m), but not in BC...guessing buddy in the pic is in a state where he cant tow tandem"
854882,TennesseeGuy,2014-05-23 17:26:00,957,Probably running Tennessee plates on the truck.
854889,e-z-out,2014-05-23 18:04:00,1052,Camper towing a truck with a boat on top smart person lol
854931,craigdritchie,2014-05-23 22:29:00,1586,"He was actually getting ready to hook up a second boat to the trailer hitch, I believe he was a dealer taking delivery. But you have to admit, it looks weird."
854944,aplumma,2014-05-23 23:43:00,6896,Saves on wear and tear on the trailer tires.   Art
854945,kickingfrog,2014-05-23 23:44:00,8333,The surprising thing is it isn't an escalade.
