854490,redpearl99,2014-05-21 02:39:00,259,"So i tried tying some 40lb leaders yesterday for pike but the line is too thick to maintain a great knot.  palomar and improved clinch didnt work too well  so my question is, what knot do you guys use to tie 40lb+ to a swivel ?"
854498,DRIFTER_016,2014-05-21 03:39:00,10439,I use either a Trilene knot or a UNI. I also use pliers or the hook of a large spoon to get a grip on the swivel so I can cinch it up properly.
854500,miller,2014-05-21 04:13:00,223,If you're doing an improved clinch only wrap 2-3 times with the heavier line
854501,NANUK,2014-05-21 04:22:00,797,"Canoe man loop knot,   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfHU6Dr9dKM My favorite and best knot for heavy leaders, very solid, the tag end faces backward and doesn't catch weeds. OR you can just use crimping sleeves, but use proper crimping tool and the proper method to crimp."
854513,Andy,2014-05-21 10:37:00,330,"I use the Crawford Knot on heavy flouro. Perfection loop on heavy wire. Just Google both, lots of links."
854515,Garnet,2014-05-21 11:11:00,2056,On the improved clinch make sure you pull the tag down to the eye to let the knot cinch smooth.
854518,BillM,2014-05-21 11:53:00,17367,"Improved clinch works for me, but like mentioned above, no need to wrap it 6-7 times, 2-3 times should do you just fine."
854529,bman32,2014-05-21 13:16:00,27,Sail has crimping kits near the musky lures. Might be easier to crimp such heavy line.
854543,DRIFTER_016,2014-05-21 14:56:00,10439,40# is not heavy line. No need to crimp until you hit 80#+ line.
854552,bare foot wader,2014-05-21 17:22:00,1354,"thicker diameter = less wraps  I don't use the improved for heavy lines, just a regular clinch with 2 or 3 turns in 60 lb mono, easy to tie and the knot pulls up nice and tight...pull hard, you want to stretch the line and set the knot"
854571,davey buoy,2014-05-21 19:22:00,5505,"Anything to a swivel or snap swivel regular clinch knot works well.I do 5 times ,don't no why,habit I guess.Line to line is where my problems start lol.Unless I fly fish I don't have to worry about that so much."
854588,bigbuck,2014-05-21 21:16:00,2449,San diego jam knot works awesome for fluoro. I use it to tie 50 lb quick strike rigs for pike.

I used the albright knot for line to line.  It seems to be a wonderful knot when wanting to connect a lower diameter braid to a high diameter leader"

854635,Gregoire,2014-05-22 00:59:00,1397,"Palomar knot should work with 40#, just wet the line and pull it tight."
854643,SlowPoke,2014-05-22 03:15:00,2984,I use one knot for everything from 4lb mono - 120 lb mono....never had a knot failure.  Nail knot...
854649,wormdunker,2014-05-22 07:09:00,1711,animatedknots.com    Very informative.  I can't help with heavy line.  I'm a walleye guy using much lighter line.
