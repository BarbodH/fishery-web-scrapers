No pics and we left after abit because it was obvious the walleye hadn't spawned yet. Lotsa boats did the same, which was nice to see:) so i decided to give my buddy a call and arrange to have my kids and their friends visit the sturgeon hatchery. Turns out that was the right call! Kids had a blast!!!!  Only 5 males and 5 females but the kids learned a lot and got to witness their strength by trying to hold onto their tails, which caused a lot of laughter haha, some good facewashes!!!"
