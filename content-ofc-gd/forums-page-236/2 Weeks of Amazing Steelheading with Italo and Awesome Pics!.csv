853670,Maverick,2014-05-14 14:48:00,371,Awesome pics. What camera did you use for the half in and half out of the water shots?
853677,mistaredone,2014-05-14 16:27:00,913,X3 that might be the new standard release shot.
853722,davey buoy,2014-05-14 19:46:00,5505,"I like Italo alot with his Canadian Sport Fishing show,BUT,Received a e-mail back from him two days ago saying UFINDFISH app for Blackberry will not be released.  .WTH,lol.can't get rid of the phone though .Great split water shots guys as mentioned !looked like fun."
853782,pidge,2014-05-15 02:22:00,438,Wow some really cool pics you've got there I also think that's pretty neat you get to fish with a fishing celeb.
853791,bigredfisher,2014-05-15 03:07:00,300,Ya Italio was telling me you guys did good. Unfortunately considering the great water conditions we only managed small residents and a few chub.

What about for Android?  Form what I understand most, if not all, Android apps will run on Blackberry phones."
853805,Aaron Shirley,2014-05-15 05:44:00,655,"Thanks everyone. We had a blast! I think the rivers are flushing most of the steelhead back to the lake now.  PitViper,  Italo seemed to use a different reel every time lol. He used a Shift 5 inch offset handle centrepin, a black RTYPE Centre pin and a Classic drifter all made by Rapala. I like the Classic Drifter and Shift Centrepins. I was using the Shift."
853806,Aaron Shirley,2014-05-15 05:53:00,655,"Lunatic, Italo is the same guy off camera. The only difference being that he has more of a teaching way about him when he is behind the camera as opposed to just fun fishing."
853808,Aaron Shirley,2014-05-15 06:31:00,655,"Maverick,  I use an Olympus TG2 compact tough camera for all the shots you see in this post except for the smaller photos at the end. Italo took those with his DSLR. I got the camera at Christmas after doing months of research. I am really glad I did so much research, as the camera is amazing and takes great photos above and below the water. And half above and below lol. There are two waterproof lens attachments that can be purchased for it, a zoom lens and wide angle. I got the wide angle. The wide angle lens attachment is best to get a good half above and below shot. The area of the lens is much larger and can be more easily positioned to get a much better half and half shot. I tried without the wide angle lens and didn't get really good shots.  The TG2 was $300. The wide angle attachment was $100. Best $400. I have ever spent on a camera. It also accepts filters. I have a circular polarizing filter for it as well. It takes incredible super macro shots as well. The TG3 is out now. The big difference being the TG2 is 12mp and the TG3 is 16mp. The TG3 also has built in WiFi where the TG2 doesn't have WiFi. I highly recommend the Olympus TG2 or TG3 to anyone looking for the best compact tough waterproof camera. Oh yeah, it takes great full 1080p HD video as well.  FYI in my research I learned that the Nikon was by far the worst tough underwater compact camera. This was evident at all stores having lots in stock and the Olympus was selling out weekly. Bad reviews on performance and water damage from lots of people in reviews. Cannon ranked second last. Surprising as both Nikon and Cannon make great cameras in general. They just don't seem to put much effort into the growing tough waterproof market. The other worthwhile camera to look at is the Pentax, and not surprising it has the exact same fast lens as the Olympus TG2. I didn't research any inexpensive models, just the high end compact tough waterproof cameras."
853809,Aaron Shirley,2014-05-15 06:58:00,655,"Davey Buoy, I think you are a minority with a BB! I gave up mine for Android years ago, as did most people I know. I just got the Samsung S5 and love it. Amazing phone. My wife has a new iPhone and loves it as well. The kids always want our phones now though lol. They never wanted my BB with its lack of apps. They killed themselves by not going with an Android platform years ago. They always had good hardware, but a lack of app support made me switch. Have you tried to install the Android UFindfish app on your BB?  I have Navionics on my phone and it rocks. It works better than my sonar charts. Great on the ice. Tony and I take screen shots and send them to each other so we know each others 411 when we split up in search mode. I just lost hundreds of way points switching over to the S5 though, as I forgot to sign up for the cloud storage for Navionics. I will not make that mistake again!"

Thanks Aaron for the reply.Had the s3,and the iphone 4s.This phone the q5 with the keyboard what a nice phone for me.Could never really get used to texting with the on screen buttons.It's about as fast as you can get and from what I have seen there sure is still a big followig.Your thinking Android may work?,it is Android based.May give it a try."
