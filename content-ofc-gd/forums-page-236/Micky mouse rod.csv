854340,mike rousseau,2014-05-20 03:29:00,4661,Just thought I'd give you all the short and sweet on this one...  Took my 3 year old fishing for walleye with his new Micky mouse rod (the ones about 2 feet long). 7-8 pounder got it to the boat and the hook popped... Lol... Turn around for another pass and bang... A 4.5-5 pounder on the 2 foot rod... Lol  Couldn't believe it...
854362,Gallie,2014-05-20 11:56:00,1215,Awesome.
854379,bigbuck,2014-05-20 13:40:00,2449,"On many an outing, my daughter's dora the explorer rod was the hot stick, whether it was panfish or pike. Hopefully, your little guy will develop a passion for fishing."
854381,Big Cliff,2014-05-20 13:52:00,6899,"We had a 7 year old land a 43"" muskie off our dock with a Spiderman fishing rod. There were a few tense moments as she screamed ""it's going to pull me in the water""! Dad had to net it for her but she got it to the dock!  Glad to hear your young lad is getting some fish, won't be long and he'll be out fishing dad LOL."
854408,captpierre,2014-05-20 17:02:00,2521,So.....why are we spending $200 on rods?
854412,Steelheadphycho,2014-05-20 17:47:00,470,NO DOUBT!!!!
854413,Thrilla,2014-05-20 18:04:00,164,"My Son landed a 30+ inch pike on a little rod like that couldn't believe it until I looked at the line, must be 30lb mono on the thing lol"
854437,mercman,2014-05-20 20:32:00,7054,Not surprised Mike. You could catch walleye on shoe laces if you had to. Good to see Connor is following your footsteps Bud !
854444,mike rousseau,2014-05-20 21:39:00,4661,Cause it took a while to figure out if He was snagged or had a big fish... Lol  2 foot rod and mono... Couldn't feel anything
854453,manitoubass2,2014-05-20 22:33:00,11391,That's awesome mike! My son landed the biggest smallie I've seen in my life on one of those rods. Almost gave me a heart attack watching him fight it lol. As soon as it got close enough i hand lined it to make sure he got it lol. Wrecked his whole spool of line haha stretched right out
854471,grimsbylander,2014-05-20 23:51:00,3016,"Great idea. I could take so many more rods in the rod locker too!  Sounds like a you had a blast! If he had landed that first walleye, his PB would have beat mine!"
854493,moxie,2014-05-21 02:43:00,1566,So.....why are we spending $200 on rods? hehehehe.
854599,Canuck2fan,2014-05-21 22:08:00,1444,"I have seen it many a time..... Kid with the cartoon character rod handing us the humble pie. I especially love it when the kid catches a HUGE carp and lands it. While the ""pros"" with 500 bucks worth of rods and pods get skunked!!!!"
