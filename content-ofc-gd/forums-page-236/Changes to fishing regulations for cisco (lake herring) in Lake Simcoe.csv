I find it odd that they are asking for input.   Aren't these decisions supposed to be based on some actual science?   What the heck do I know about the herring population on Simcoe?  It looks good to me, but so what?   Maybe it isn't. The cynic in me says they've already decided what they are going to do and this is just window dressing. On the other hand, since both options are similar (IF the regs are followed) they might actually take the public's input into consideration."

848924,dhickey,2014-04-20 01:47:00,1038,Are they any good pickled?  Combining it with whitefish is stupid on several levels.  Don.
848930,kickingfrog,2014-04-20 02:42:00,8333,But so are the people who claim to not know the difference between the two.
848938,Joey,2014-04-20 03:42:00,9122,"Are they any good pickled?  Combining it with whitefish is stupid on several levels.  Don.  Yes, I have pickled them before and they are delicious!"
848943,dhickey,2014-04-20 04:16:00,1038,Ok so pickled is good. I want some.  But I don't understand why herring should be funneled in with whitefish???   Just because lazy people cant take 2 minutes to figure out the simple difference between the two seems extremely unfair to those that abide by the rules and know the difference between different types of fish or even the hybrids within a particular species .  Personally I would love the opportunity to take home 2 herring along with a whitefish or 2.
848955,kickingfrog,2014-04-20 13:01:00,8333,Unfortunately what is fair rarely plays a role in these decisions.
848963,cisco,2014-04-20 13:48:00,597,"Saltydawg makes a good point.  Creel surveys are probably showing wayyy reduced whitefish harvest. Less heat on MNR to quietly combine whitefish with cisco in option 2 to help reduce whitefish harvest. ""Anglers want option 2!"" is what MNR may be claiming soon to avoid this heat.  With $$$ cuts, increased whitefish stocking ....even maintaining whitefish stocking, is tough to achieve. MNR likes ticketing dumb anglers so the argument of 'some anglers can't tell the difference' doesn't fly at all IMHO. Keep in mind that MNR is only asking about cisco yet due to option 2 we know whitefish is also 'on the table'. MNR needs to be pressed on what it's position is on this species and what it's thinking about doing. Regardless of angler input on herring the MNR can still fiddle with whitefish."
849037,Joeytier,2014-04-20 20:12:00,3990,"I find it very surprising that people find herring just as good as whitefish.  I've tried them from Nipissing on multiple occasions and...BLAHH!!  Whitefish is much, much, much better imo"
849048,misfish,2014-04-20 21:01:00,29133,"I find it very surprising that people find herring just as good as whitefish. I've tried them from Nipissing on multiple occasions and...BLAHH!! Whitefish is much, much, much better imo  Our herring have world class taste.  They are to be smoked or pickled like said. Ya you can fry them up,salt pepper and some lime .  A limit of two is not worth the effort of firing up the smoker or pickling. I would just broil them with  liquid smoke and lots of fresh ground pepper. Dry them right out."
850397,c10,2014-04-27 02:28:00,131,"In my opinion, I would keep it closed for a couple more years for a couple reasons.  First, I think it would really help the Trout, Walleye etc. populations grow in size and number because of more bait available for them, but also why take the chance?  I mean yes, I caught more of them this year then before, but it is better safe than sorry IMO.  I think a couple more years of stocking and no fishing would also really help the reproduction of them naturally and create a buffer so if it for some reason doesn't work with limited harvest they aren't a completely collapsed population.  Anybody else agree?"

I thought the same thing, I guess times are tough at the MNR, it's just a computer literate kid sitting at a computer, making online surveys  with such a conservative proposed ciscoe limit, why even bother making the change?"
850407,Gerritt,2014-04-27 03:48:00,6129,"Forgive my ignorance on ciscoe,  Being dutch I have grown up eating herring, mainly pickled, from a jar here in canada vs. road side cart stands in holland. Are the fish I am used to eating in jars etc the same fish as the fish being proposed here?  G"

850466,kickingfrog,2014-04-27 15:33:00,8333,"One man's delicacy is another's staple is another's cat food.  I'm not going to suggest what someone should, or shouldn't, enjoy eating. My only concern is the overall health of the fishery.  The MNR's numbers support opening up the fishery but in a limited trial. It's not just that the numbers are up but that the overall lake health is much improved from the 70's-80's.  Compare the cisco limits, if any, on other bodies of water. They are very generous, and so were Simcoe's back in the day, but the water quality went downhill and most of the lake's fish numbers dropped."
850592,dhickey,2014-04-28 00:38:00,1038,There must be a way to figure this out. I have caught  so many herring over the past 7-8 years it becomes annoying at times simply because I have to put back fish that I am sure will die. The worst of them are in the11-14 inch range?? To big for walleye and only the huge lakers go after herring that big. Pike could but I don't think that pike would be a considerable factor?  Therefore a slot size might be in order combined with a daily catch limit along with a possession limit that allows knowledgeable anglers to expand their options ?  Those that don't know the difference. Screw them hit them with fines. Fines would help generate money for the MNR as well as keep the clowns off the lakes.  Just my humble /biased opinion.  Don.

848601,TJQ,2014-04-18 15:46:00,7806,"The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), with the support of the Lake Simcoe Fisheries Stakeholder Committee, is inviting the public to provide input on proposed changes to fishing regulations for cisco (lake herring) in Lake Simcoe.  The cisco population within Lake Simcoe has shown positive trends in recent years. The ministry is considering re-introducing limited harvest opportunities for anglers to support sustainable resource management and promote recreational angling opportunities.  Lake Simcoe’s cisco population once provided a major food source for several species of sport fish, as well as a significant recreational fishery. However, in 2001, the fishery was closed following several years of population decline due to a lack of natural reproduction. The decline was largely associated with habitat degradation in the form of low dissolved oxygen content within the deep, coldwater habitat of the lake. Habitat conditions have since improved, and recent population monitoring by MNR has suggested a positive trend as the population continues its recovery. Increased cisco numbers have resulted in cautious optimism by fishery managers and anglers alike.  The proposed options include:  Limits Option #1: Sport Fishing Licence: 2, Conservation Licence: 1 Option #2: Sport Fishing Licence: 2 (Aggregate Limit with Lake Whitefish), Conservation Licence: 1 (Aggregate Limit with Lake Whitefish)  Proposed Season January 1st to March 15th and 2nd Saturday in May to September 30th  Recent monitoring data suggest positive trends, including a total of nine year classes present in the population with two strong year classes since 2008. This has supported an increase in relative abundance over the past three years. A very strong year class was also evident in 2004; however, many of these cisco have since died due to natural causes.  The proposed regulatory options are not anticipated to negatively impact the cisco population or other fish species in Lake Simcoe.  Based on the positive monitoring information, MNR supports a limited cisco fishery that encourages sustainable harvest opportunities. This support recognizes the irrevocable changes in the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Simcoe (such as invasive species) and that the lake will likely not support historical population levels of cisco again. The proposed regulation changes align with the Lake Simcoe Fisheries Community Objectives which aim to manage cisco as a forage base for lake trout, and when sustainable, to re-open a cisco fishery, for harvest opportunities. These proposed changes are endorsed by the Lake Simcoe Fisheries Stakeholder Committee and MNR’s Lake Simcoe Fisheries Management Committee.  The proposed regulatory options are not anticipated to increase the number of anglers on Lake Simcoe. However, they could increase the total number of angler hours on Lake Simcoe annually by providing additional recreational opportunities to existing fisheries. Angler reports of incidental catches of cisco have increased in recent years.  The Ministry of Natural Resources and the Lake Simcoe Fisheries Stakeholder Committee welcome your input on these proposed changes and all feedback received will inform the decision-making process.  You can provide your feedback through email at [email protected]. For more information, you can contact the Aurora District office at 905-713-7398. There is also an Environmental Registry Posting associated with these proposed changes.

848622,bushart,2014-04-18 17:16:00,2628,I never thought there'd be any demand to catch and keep Ciscoes to eat  Only ones I've seen have been beside my boat after being Horked out of a good sized laker or willy when they're tryin to spit the hook  Sooo after seein so many 2nd hand ciscoes----take a few pops and a double dog dare fore I would eat one
848624,Terry,2014-04-18 17:27:00,14456,there was a major fishery for herring I can remember people with 45 gallon drums on the back of their pickup trucks and they  would fill them with  herring  most were bound for the US  border they could not be sold  legally in canada but once in the US  they could be sold..... I don't like smoked herring but lots of people do
848631,misfish,2014-04-18 18:37:00,29133, I DO I DO
848632,irishfield,2014-04-18 18:46:00,26272,Fillet.. coat and deep fry and they taste like any other fish.  ...but because many can't seem to tell the difference between a large herring and a Whitie.. maybe they should go with  Option #2
848642,Terry,2014-04-18 19:28:00,14456,"I agree  I know many people just want to take home as many as possible, but I think option 2 would be the best choice because of reason Wayne stated"
848646,bushart,2014-04-18 19:36:00,2628,I know this is only a personal preference---but someone said they taste a lot like whitefish---and apologies for getting a bit off track here  I get told all the time how great whitefish are---and I've caught lots in my life  One spring my buddy in NW Ontario and I caught lots in the 6-8 lb range in the English river  I've tried them fried--baked---smoked---I hate em all  Like I can eat cats outta good water-----bass (unheard of to some)-----I've even tried canned sucker meat (again outta good water)  But the whitey population is really safe in my hands----so I guess so will ciscoes (unless I needs trout bait )
848654,EC1,2014-04-18 20:16:00,930,"Had my first cisco earlier this year (Not from Simcoe) - Tastes just like any other fish, has the same cucumber smell as whities, just not as pronounced.  Now I'm really interested to catch a few to use as bait. I'm not so interested in keeping whitefish, so both of these options are fine by me. If only the limit was closer to 5 or 10, I wouldn't need to buy live bait anymore."
848655,Terry,2014-04-18 20:28:00,14456,you can't use them as bait on simcoe and you can't use them as live bait anywhere else

848675,Terry,2014-04-18 22:40:00,14456,"well yeah just simcoe, but they are not considered bait fish on simcoe so you can not transport them  live from simcoe just like all other sport fish there for they will be dead bait for use on other lakes"
848677,Christopheraaron,2014-04-18 22:45:00,3525,"Yes, but you aren't able to keep them out there at all right now, I'm sure if this change goes through we'll be able to use them for bait on Simcoe."
