854451,Locnar,2014-05-20 22:25:00,645,"I left my house at 5:45am on Saturday and arrived in Huntsville at 7:45am. I met up with my sister-in-law's brother, and hit Vernon Lake for some pre-tourney fishing. This is where it gets interesting haha. Water was cold and very tinted. I've never fished water quite that colour. It was basically tea. What makes the water that colour? Is it the iron in the surrounding shield rock, or is it Peat that gets washed into the lake? We fished shallows bays in hope of finding some pike... no luck... kept moving, and made our way to the far end of the lake. I managed to catch one OOS smallie, that was a fair 2lbs. That is when the boat breaks down... the engine started overheating like crazy. We had to limp our way back to the launch by running the trolling motor... and running the engine for like 4 minute spurts every 20 minutes or so... it took us 2 hours to get back. Buddy spent $160 gettin' 'er repaired... turned out the thermostat was in many pieces and the impeller was in even more pieces. We decided not to enter the tourney, as we hadn't tested the boat out after repairs yet. So we went out to the bar that night for a couple beers... that turned into far too many beers... And the next morning we set off to Orillia to his friend's cottage to test the boat and see if we can't catch any pike there. I didn't catch jack, and just 10 minutes before we were about to pack it up Buddy catches a nice 28"" pike... Which inhaled the jerkbait... halfway down its throat... so, that pike met its fate on the dinner plate.  A short while later I was back at home, and realized I had some bait gettin' passed its prime in my fridge... so I headed over to a local fishing hole for some bullheads and maybe a pikey. I didn't catch either, but I did catch my first White Perch and an OOS Largie. Yesterday, my brother, another friend and I went up to Bobcaygeon for some panfish action, with hopes of maybe hooking into a walleye... no eyes were caught. A couple more OOS Bass, and many panfish. Cool flooded river, could canoe in the woods if ya wanted to.   Sittin at the Lakeside Bar. ""Why'd you give me your beer?"" As he had borrowed mine for the next picture     All OOS were quickly released.  The weekend didn't turn out as expected, but much fun never-the-less."
