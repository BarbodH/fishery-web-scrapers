854700,mirogak,2014-05-22 16:47:00,387,Awesome report buddy ... my mouth is watering.  I am going next weekend.  Quick question : did you attach night crawlers to your spoons?  What colors/patterns worked best?  Miro

854116,muskymatt,2014-05-18 14:03:00,2608,"My buds and I do an annual trek and portage deep into Algonquin every spring and this year we decided to step it up a bit and do a push deep into the center of the park via the Nippissing river. We decided to stay at Brent on the night before our departure just so we could get an early start without the 4 hr drive from Ottawa. Jake had a bunk house for us which suited the need perfectly.   After a good meal and a couple pints we readied the gear for the morning and hit the sack anxious of the next morning.  The paddle across Cedar was ok as the weather was good and we were now in the mouth of the Nippissing river. A quick look around and we saw a portage, the sigh was all messed up and we couldn't make out the name so like all seasoned backpackers we would refer to the map, right? Except the map is back on the table in the bunkhouse where we forgot it.  OK, so this must be the right trail, after all it is in the mouth of the Nippissing. So, we head up the trail and arrive at a lake and were greeted by 2 fellow canoeists who informed us we had just done a 1500m portage in the wrong direction lol. Back we go!!!!!! After our 2.5 hr scenic tour we were back on the water heading further up the Nippissing to the right portage, a 915 m all uphill along the Nippissing river.    The Nippissing was pretty high, current was pretty tough to paddle in the lower section but we made it through the rough stuff to the slightly less flowing section.   Ahead of us was 5 more portages and a 1410 m uphill trek into our lake which would be our home for the next week. Time was a concern now because we did the 2.5 hr 3 km detour in the morning, now it looked like we would have to stay at the last site on the river before the 16.6km paddle.   to be cont....."
854118,muskymatt,2014-05-18 14:13:00,2608,"Our view from the shore of our site for the night.   We sat around the campfire talking of our trip and then were serenaded by a pack of wolves not too far off. Very cool!!  Day 2  Up early, pack up and we are back on the water expecting to be at our lake within 3.5-4 hrs.   The portage  access point off the Nippissing into our lake.  The 1410 portage into our lake was a grueling uphill battle with downed trees blocking the trail and was also littered with moose droppings, this was obviously a very popular area based on the amount of droppings lol.  Finally we hit the shore of our lake and we can see our site across the lake, now we are getting excited.   The second canoe coming across to our site.  Set up was quick and the water was calm, we had Brookies on our minds!   Mark was first to hit the Brookies with a couple of beauties.   To be cont....."
854120,muskymatt,2014-05-18 14:45:00,2608," First 2 of the week  Our campsite was pretty well picked clean of any good firewood so we had to scan the shores of the lake to see if any good wood was available to us. Along one area was a scene of mass destruction, like a bomb had gone off. We agreed that a huge lightning event had taken place. All the roots were burnt and many were toppled.     This would be our source of firewood for the week, and only a km from our site.  Day 3  Up early and a good bacon, eggs, and fish breakfast we were ready for our first full day on the lake. The fishing was awesome!!!!     To be cont.......  "
854123,muskymatt,2014-05-18 14:55:00,2608,"  A full Brookie meal with rice, baked beans  and a veggie was off the charts delicious.  Time for a fire and relaxation     Day 4  More brookie action at it's finest.    The lake was able to be covered by canoe in it's length in about 1 hr. Not the biggest but very clean, deep and scenic!    We were able to try our brookies in about 5 different preparations, all of which seemed better than the last, man this stuff was like candy!  to be cont.....   "
854139,Tim Mills,2014-05-18 17:56:00,476,Awesome report... Did you consider going back for the map? Or was the route straight forward enough that once you found the portage you could be ok without it.  impressive portaging glad your hard work paid off and the fishing was good.
854140,muskymatt,2014-05-18 18:01:00,2608,"Awesome report... Did you consider going back for the map? Or was the route straight forward enough that once you found the portage you could be ok without it.  impressive portaging glad your hard work paid off and the fishing was good. We did consider going back but it was an hour paddle in each direction, the route was easy to follow once on the right trail, just getting started was the problem lol."
854141,misfish,2014-05-18 18:03:00,29133,See what you can do when your team is golfing?   Great report and write up Matt.    Love the old stove.  
854142,muskymatt,2014-05-18 18:07:00,2608,"Here are some fish pics, these Brookies fought like crazy and hit like a freight train. All, except one were caught trolling at the slowest speed possible with a spoon. Only one was caught casting.      to be cont......"
854143,muskymatt,2014-05-18 18:13:00,2608,"The fish bite was good pretty much anytime of the day, it rained every day and when it wasn't raining, it was overcast. I bet this made the fishing even better.    The tarp was up pretty much the whole time due to the nightly rains, still it was a blast and the fire was always going.     Dan and Mark back from a trout trip!  to be cont..."
854144,muskymatt,2014-05-18 18:18:00,2608,"The meat in these fish was insane, I have never tasted any better. We had them fried with salt and pepper, in foil on the fire, coated in fish rub, dipped in seasoned bread crumbs and done in beer batter, all were fantastic!!   Dan and Mark with a few on the water    Tear down starts....    Tout la gang ready for departure    To be cont.......     "
854146,muskymatt,2014-05-18 18:22:00,2608,"Lots of signs of nature everywhere you looked, this moose has seen better days lol    Any access point was rough at best, this was about the easiest.    The beautiful Nippissing river, snaking it's way along.    Beautiful scenery     To be cont.... "

854154,misfish,2014-05-18 19:00:00,29133,Not good to eat.  
854155,muskymatt,2014-05-18 19:03:00,2608,Not good to eat.   Why not?  I thought they were fiddleheads
854157,misfish,2014-05-18 19:15:00,29133,"It is a fern,but not like you will find here along creeks and rivers. The fuzzy white gives it away.  Check the fiddle thread Matt"

854160,leaf4,2014-05-18 19:45:00,2466,"nice report, up until about 5 years ago, my grandparents have been going up to cedar lake for the past 45 years, fantastic lake and beautiful scenery, quite the haul from hamilton but well worth the drive"
854171,lew,2014-05-18 21:38:00,12766,"Thanks for that Matt, that was a very enjoyable read."
854172,manitoubass2,2014-05-18 22:15:00,11391,"All that bike riding post game worked!   Thats awesome man! Sounds like a wicked trip:) thanks for sharing, great pics and great read!!!!"
854173,Tomcat,2014-05-18 22:42:00,395,Thanks for putting together and sharing your report Matt. Those square tails looked gorgeous!
854199,Rod Caster,2014-05-19 12:38:00,5784,"Great report Matt.  I honestly think you guys may be camping at the same spots I used to camp at with my Dad. Even if it's not the same lake, you have a wonderful location there!  Those were Cinnamon Ferns. Mildly toxic, and generally not recommended to eat unless you are one of those people who find poisonous foods to be the most adventurous  Actually they are apparently 'edible', but taste gross and do contain carcinogens which must be washed and blanched away first."
854349,Moosebunk,2014-05-20 07:35:00,3970,A great trip for ya bud.  Enjoyed the read and pics.
854416,Joeytier,2014-05-20 18:33:00,3990,That's some excellent fishing!  I can see why it has become a tradition for you and the boys
