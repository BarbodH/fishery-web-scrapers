854593,akaShag,2014-05-21 21:35:00,2073,"back to GbayGiant...........  I was not thinking this was a case of commercial poaching, and for sure I was NOT saying that the persons with the spears are from any first nation.  My point is that ""good old boys"" think that poaching is OK, they grew up thinking poaching is OK, and they are not afraid of MNR enforcement.  I thought some folks here might have been suggesting that the poachers were first nations, because that seems to be a default setting for some people when fish conservation is threatened.  On the other hand, if you think (from personal knowledge?) this was first nations folks with spears, taking fish to sell, well then I am very sorry indeed to hear that.  Doug"
854595,Canuck2fan,2014-05-21 21:54:00,1444,It doesn't matter who did it or why it was done... It is just a horrible waste of a valuable resource. I hope the article gets some leads and we can find out what happened. I doubt because of the senselessness of it that a sane explanation of why it happened will ever be found.
854602,Steve,2014-05-21 22:10:00,2075,don't be silly.  they know exactly who did it.  there is no question of that.
854604,bushart,2014-05-21 22:23:00,2628,don't be silly.  they know exactly who did it.  there is no question of that. if you know and have proof maybe you could report that to the proper authorities.....and action could be taken....just sayin
854605,Steve,2014-05-21 22:26:00,2075,too many people 'just saying' and no one with enough balls to 'start doing'.  if you think for a single second that the proper local authorities don't know exactly who did it you've been spending a little too much time in the paint room.  just sayin
854606,Canuck2fan,2014-05-21 22:27:00,1444,"don't be silly.  they know exactly who did it.  there is no question of that.  I am always amazed at any communities ability to take a tragedy without any facts and spin it this way or that to fit its fears, prejudices or low opinion of our fellow human beings.  In this post there are a lot of assumptions, leaps of logic and nasty innuendos, but NO PROOF which is ideally what I would like to see, before I accuse anyone or group."
854608,akaShag,2014-05-21 22:51:00,2073,"Well...................  ................MAYBE some people on here KNOW who the perpetrators might have been.  And IF they KNOW, and IF they fail to act, they are pretty much in the same league as the poachers.  My view of course.  My reasonably educated guess is that nobody on this board actually KNOWS the identity of the spear-carrying fish killers, but lots of folks appear to enjoy playing the blame game, which does not advance fish conservation one iota.  But here is an offer:  I have a friend who is a well-placed senior Ontario conservation officer.  If anybody here knows the ACTUAL IDENTITY of the perpetrator(s), send me a pm and I will absolutely ensure that the name(s) of the guilty person(s) will be passed by me to him.  And furthermore, I will report back here what he tells me.  Because, notwithstanding the certitude stated by our colleague Steve, I do NOT think the MNR ""knows exactly"" who might be responsible.  But I acknowledge I have been wrong many times before and might be wrong again, but I am not afraid to admit that.  Doug"

Many years ago I met a bunch of good old boys from North of Highway 7, who went spearing for ""pickerel"" every spring.  They considered it their birthright, it had been done for years and by the generations before them, and they were not about to stop.  Yes, on the Moira.  Nope, no reference to treaty rights (which may or may not exist in relation to this fishery, I have no idea.)  They were rural Ontario rednecks and saw nothing wrong with their poaching.  Those men would be in their 50s and 60s now, with children and possibly grandchildren, and I am guessing the spears being used have been ""in the family"" for years.  Education has not been successful, and fear of enforcement has probably diminished along with the MNR budget.  VERY sad.  Doug"

I have a family member that commercial fishes LOTW. At least twice somebody has hauled his nets and left them in his front yard full of fish, which is just rediculous. A few years ago i came home to a 6ft sturgeon laying in my yard. No idea who how or why? But thank god i was able to revive the fish after contacting MNR. Some people just do really stupid stuff."
854476,bigugli,2014-05-21 00:51:00,6138,"Down here in Niagara there are communities which also have similar views to those experienced by akaShag up in Moira. Until 2008, pike could be speared and netted, and fished all year.  Seems many here have not heard of the regs changes, and there are those who feel they are ""entitled' to carry on as their forbears did. No it is not the native community, nor is it the immigrant community. Some of these communities have 200-250 year histories."
