If I was going to be breaking in a new motor,and not knowing the lake,thats the last one I would be going to. Why not just hit cooks bay? Pike and perch to be had,and no unknown rocks or shoals to worry about.  Just saying."

Just saying. i thought about that,ive never fished cooks bay before either and almost everyone i talk to about it over the past 2 years tell me big pike are there but hard to get.also told its swamped with boaters and the weather gets nasty quick. long story short its like everyone hands me a skull and cross bones card whenever i mention cooks bay lol. im open to any suggestions within 2.5 hours of hamilton"
855043,Lunatic,2014-05-24 23:20:00,536,i actually might go to sparrow lake instead.could be a game time decision.
855050,Garnet,2014-05-25 01:38:00,2056,You can't run the channel between the 2 lakes. Even in high water like now. Then passed Avery Point on the right is covered with shoals that are just under the water at this time.  You are right loaded with small pike.
