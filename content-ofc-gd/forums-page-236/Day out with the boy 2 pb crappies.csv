We both got new pb crappie and a new catfish record too. 16 slabs (12 home), 5 oos bas, 1 pike (him) and catfish plus a few nice sized rockies. A turtle got a hold of our stringer before we left, leaving 2 crappie heads for us to laugh at. His crappie was 12"" and mine was 14"".  You can see assumed claw marks on the 14 from the snapper. Lucky I got a pic at all!!    "
