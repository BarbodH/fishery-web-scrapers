855016,kickingfrog,2014-05-24 19:29:00,8333,It felt heavy for its length. Never put a tape on it because it wasn't that big but it looks even smaller in the photos... Ain't that always the way.  Good reason not to take photos of some things.
855017,spincast,2014-05-24 19:37:00,3279,the second one looks like it were some slimy fun.Gonna have to make a trip for some of those soon.
