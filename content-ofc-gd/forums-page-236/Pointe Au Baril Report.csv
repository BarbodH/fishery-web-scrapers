855082,tizfun,2014-05-25 14:23:00,292,Used to fish that area every spring for pike....Haven't been in a couple years . Just a little too many rocks for my liking as our boats have now have become a little more expensive that what we used to fish out of..  What are the water levels like now ??  Great fish...
