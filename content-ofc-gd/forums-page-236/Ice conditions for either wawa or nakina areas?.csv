850839,BillM,2014-04-29 11:49:00,17367,I'd probably call your outfitter... They'd have the best up to date info.
850854,Dara,2014-04-29 12:47:00,3052,"I was on Big Basswood this weekend and there was 12"" of good ice.  Wawa really hasn't started to melt yet"
850864,Basskicker,2014-04-29 13:06:00,421,"Up here in Manitouwadge, there is still 2-3 feet of snow in the bush but going fast!!! However, the creeks haven't even let go yet. There is still 24-36"" of ice, going to be close again this year for opener.  This was taken back on April 12 up at Ara Lake up near Nakina and I was unable to drill a hole without my extension.  There was easily 45+"" of ice then!!!!  "

Just wondering if anyone has some info on how the thaw is coming on either of those areas Starting to get a little worried Thanks  I also had a trip booked for the last week of May way north of Nakina, north of the Albany River. And had a back up plan in place to a lake in the White River area.  We made the call two weeks ago to cancel the further north trip and go with our back up lake.  If I were you and was flying north of Nakina on the opener I'd be worried too LOL!  Where are you going and what's your back up lake?"

852293,acplumber,2014-05-06 17:40:00,28,"So I got an email from nakina saying they won't be open for the opening weekend, which is very unfortunate So we have our plan b booked now We are going with air-dale to little missinaibi Does anyone have any tips they could share with us plz? Where should we start to look for them this early in the year? Thx acplumber"
852300,anders,2014-05-06 19:01:00,1168,The Wawa area isnt going to open for at least 2-3 weeks.  Ice is just starting to pull away from the shore now.
852305,Basskicker,2014-05-06 19:29:00,421,"I literally just got in about 15 minutes ago from my camp.....had to walk 3.5km through knee high snow in spots.....only to find that the ice was TIGHT to the shore with over 24"" of ice!!!! Not a chance in hell of fishing opener this year!!!  Good exercise though....."
852312,solopaddler,2014-05-06 20:39:00,8605,"I'm assuming you've seen these Chapleau webcams, but there's not much doubt you'll be good to go for the last week of May on Little Miss.  http://www.canadianfishing.com/1-galleries/for-webcam2/index.html  I'm happy to help with some suggestions for Little Miss. Give me a call (contact info is on my website) and have the Little Miss map in front of you.  Cheers"
852333,pike slayer,2014-05-06 22:11:00,1177,on the weekend i was up towards wawa. i was at kenny lake at the beginning of the park and it was wide open with no ice although on my lake here 20min from the sault there is still ice but im betting its gone by the end of the week.

852422,tbills50,2014-05-07 12:28:00,5,I've got a friend heading up to Esnagi in two weeks or so and then we are headed up on June 15th. Do you think teh ice will be melted and fishing good by then in the Wawa-Esnagi area?  Tom
852444,solopaddler,2014-05-07 14:16:00,8605,"I've got a friend heading up to Esnagi in two weeks or so and then we are headed up on June 15th. Do you think teh ice will be melted and fishing good by then in the Wawa-Esnagi area?  Tom  My feeling is the earlier date will be a bit tougher especially for walleye. The water will be too cold. Pike fishing will be better though as they'll be concentrated in the shallow bays. I believe the June 15th date will be absolutely prime for everything.  Which lodge are you going to, Camp 88 or Marmac? Or will you be staying at an outpost? I'm a big fan of White River Air and the Maclachlan's, they're great people!"

852680,tbills50,2014-05-08 17:40:00,5,We stay at Esnagi Lodge and take Hawk Air in from Wawa. Good times had by all. Thanks for the weather/ice update. We will be keeping tabs on it for his late May trip and our 6/15 trip.  Tom
853763,tbills50,2014-05-15 00:37:00,5,"So, any updates on the Esnagi Lake ice out, fishing conditions? We actually fly from Hawk's Junction I think into Esnagi Lodge. I am down state in MI and it is getting cold again here, in the 40's and 50's.  Thanks for any updates for the Wawa, Esnagi area?  Tom"

853848,anders,2014-05-15 17:52:00,1168,"Just got off the phone with a pilot in the area and he said the majority of lakes north of Wawa are still frozen over including Esnagi, Kaby etc.  Workers yesterday were in the bush with quads and hindsight being 20-20 they should have used sleds and with the cold temps now and the next couple days including 5cm of snow, the ice wont be gone any time soon"
853894,Basskicker,2014-05-15 22:37:00,421,"I just got back from camp, the shore line even froze back up this morning, had to break it up to wash the face and now its snowing!!!!   Got to love the great white north."
854455,tbills50,2014-05-20 22:54:00,5,Marmac-Lodge 88 says the ice is out and the fishing has begun!
