I used to launch at the old King st bridge then head down to the damn in Cambridge - but there is a portage and some shallow sections on that so it may be out given the leg.  Once Bass is open, Glen Morris to Paris is a great stretch for a day. The Nith can be fun too if the water levels are right http://www.grandriver.ca/"
