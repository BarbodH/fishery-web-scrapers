Big bull Redfish, Black Drum, Snook, all 20 paces from our little beach home we rent. If I've done this right the last one is a quick video of a Golith Grouper that grabbed my bait I was catching for some Shark fishing. I was severely undergeared but fought him over 45 minutes. There was a random lady who was nice enough to take the rod for a spell while I pumped blood back into my fore arms. He eventually broke the 40 lb braid so I tipped my hat and wished him well. Nice thing about this vacation is wives never say no to a private home on a beach! "
854190,Musky or Specks,2014-05-19 03:37:00,2710,Looks like a great time. Video is not working
854207,AnglerJake,2014-05-19 13:36:00,6,Mind sharing where it is?
854215,moparhawk,2014-05-19 14:34:00,146,"Not at all. Its North Captiva Island. Basically its off the Ft Meyers area thru Pine Island. Its not a resort hotspot as there are no hotels. just a couple restaurants and some great sand trails to go golf carting on. There are no cars on the island. Fly in, pick up groceries, bait, and your favorite drink for a week and get lost in the sun, surf, and fishing. I could not exaggerate on how good the fishing is. Wish I could get the video to load. That grouper was a 100 lb fish. The Shark fishing is so crazy. Catch a rough fish, slit its belly for a good blood trail and hang on. Late one night I broke a 80 lb braided leader on one.  "

854289,moparhawk,2014-05-19 23:12:00,146," That sounds amazing! Would love to do that trip with my wife. Mike its perfect for couples. There's not a lot of distractions so the focus is on each other. The homes for rent run the gambit from cosy to outrageous. We rent the same home as its priced fair and has a private dock which becomes a snook haven at night when the lights draw in the shrimp. Seriously, the best ocean fishing of your life and no guide fees. There's a really nice lady who guides from shore and has acess to some private spots. Check her website. http://www.northcaptivafishinglady.com/"
854291,moparhawk,2014-05-19 23:26:00,146, Very cool report. Did you keep any for the Grill? Here you go Tim. How about some fish tacos! Here's my wife with a really nice Jack Crevell. Heck half the fun is identifying the fish you catch and a photo of the dock. 
854311,BillM,2014-05-20 00:42:00,17367,I'm going to seriously consider this place the next time I head down to Florida..  Fantastic report.  gf can sunbath all day and I'll fish!
854333,Joey,2014-05-20 02:21:00,9122,Those are some cool looking fish!
854350,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-20 08:25:00,8243,"Fantastic. I've never been to that specific area when we had a place at Charlotte Harbor but very close, like Sanibel Isle. I think the fishing on the west coast from El Jobean to Captiva can't be beat. I never got much farther south of the Peace River because I didn't need to. Yes the east coast from Isla Morada south is great but I think the Gulf of Florida is not only as productive it's been somewhat of a secret for years now generally hidden away from the tourist and snowbirds. The best way to describe it to other Canadians the difference is all along the west coast is like a fly in vs. a 15 cottage resort on Nippissing where one can drive to the mall if it rains. Well it was a bit of a secret until they started airing those west coast Tarpon tourneys in that area you stay at if I'm not mistaken and now you post it here. That's fine, plenty of 300 pound Goliath Grouper and 120 pound Tarpon for everyone, those are average weights my fellow Canucks."
854419,davey buoy,2014-05-20 18:48:00,5505,What a getaway the would be with yourself and your better half.Best of both worlds.
854665,Mike Pike,2014-05-22 12:52:00,1332,"Looks like paradise!  When I've gone down to Florida, I've pretty much always gone on the gulf side( just a bit north of you in the Venice and Sarisota area ).  I did make a few trips down your way and can certainly vouche for the unspoiled beauty of the area and the islands.  Thanks for the report and pics!  You guys caught some beauts!"
