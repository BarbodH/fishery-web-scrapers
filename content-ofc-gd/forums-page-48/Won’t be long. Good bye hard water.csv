1042675,Reef Runner,2019-04-08 15:42:00,980,"l was up at Canal over the weekend.  Lake still frozen over, trent waterway was wide open.  Ice moved around a few stump fields, will have to mark when boating season begins.  Water was low...they usually adjust the level in May."
1042685,porkpie,2019-04-08 17:08:00,2521,"Good bye and good riddance, I’ve already had the boat out twice!  Although I still have some ice gear rolling around in the back of my pickup for some reason.  I probably should put it away!"
1042702,Joeytier,2019-04-08 23:36:00,3990,"I'm just hoping I can be in my boat before 2nd week of May (like last year). 3 feet of snow still in the bush made for a fun snowmobile ride, but was also a little discouraging."
1042703,brkygetr,2019-04-08 23:45:00,425,I was up Haliburton way last weekend camping. Still 3.5 ft of ice on the lakes we were fishing.

1043363,Old Ironmaker,2019-04-20 23:30:00,8243,"I stopped at the Grand River Thurs to bug the shore fishermen and ladies and 1 fella told me was at the upper Niagara Wed and there is still some ice on the shoreline. I've seen ice at the upper Niagara at Buffalo in the boom they have to hold back ice the 1st of June one year. The folks in Buffalo were not too happy when they got a north wind. Brrrrr cold in June. We have a lake on both sides of us today. With all the rain and Haldimand clay underneath the woods and small field are flooded and the Mallards and Mergansers prefer it than the lake. I found out something interesting a few years back when I complained about it flooding and then flooding us a foot deep. If the drainage line that starts on someone else's property and drains and exits under my property I am responsible to unplug it. That means I will have to dig it up and if need be replace the drainage line(s). What $$$??. If they get a permit to build then they are responsible for the drainage. It's only 6"" in spots near the driveway today. Our new Wellies don't leak."
1043379,AKRISONER,2019-04-21 03:34:00,5558,"hate to rub it in boys, but was on the bass boat last week in south carolina and will be casting on the flats in cuba on Monday...lifes good ? by the time i get back and get back up north, pickerel and pike will be open and the ice will be off"
