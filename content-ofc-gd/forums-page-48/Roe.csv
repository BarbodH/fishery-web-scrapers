1042458,Big Cliff,2019-04-04 10:26:00,6899,"My son is coming down Friday to spend a few days with me, he has never caught a rainbow or salmon and I would love to let him experience that thrill. Problem is I don't have any roe and can't seem to find a place where I can buy some. Do any of you know where I can buy some roe, I only need enough to tie about a half dozen sacks. I tried every bait shop in the Port Hope area (and beyond) but no one had any. "
1042459,Garnet,2019-04-04 11:09:00,2056,Can you tie your roe. I'm meeting a buddy from Lindsay today. Fresh rainbow.
1042460,misfish,2019-04-04 11:09:00,29133,No roe required this time of year Cliff. Good ole dew worms will do the trick bottom bouncing or under a float. Panther martin spinners as well.
1042461,Big Cliff,2019-04-04 11:39:00,6899,"Yes I can, (well sort of), I do have the sac material and thread ? if you can help it would be very much appreciated!"
1042462,Rustic-Fisher,2019-04-04 12:07:00,826,"Im 5 min North of Cobourg,  I can spare some . cheers Ryan"
1042470,BillM,2019-04-04 12:56:00,17367,"Get some worms, they'll work in a pinch."
1042498,Big Cliff,2019-04-04 18:16:00,6899,"Looks like Garnet has fixed me up but that's a very kind offer, thank you!"
1042499,Big Cliff,2019-04-04 18:19:00,6899,"Thanks Bill, tried that last year, guys with roe were catching, we didn't get a hit. Could be we just didn't know what we were doing. I haven't been since Photoz and I used to hit the tribs years ago. Sure do miss that man, he was one of a kind!"
1042524,Big Cliff,2019-04-05 11:42:00,6899,"A huge thank you to Garnet who not only came through with some roe but even aranged for his buddy Rob to deliver it right to my door. That's going above and beyond, I really appreciate it!"
1042526,Garnet,2019-04-05 12:14:00,2056,Now you just need water conditions so you can catch. The board walk has been good.
1042531,Loonietoon,2019-04-05 13:56:00,1450,"As you have done for others, now others are doing for you my friend ?"
1042540,BillM,2019-04-05 15:26:00,17367,I hope to see a report with a bunch of fish Cliff!  Goodluck!
