1042738,ketchenany,2019-04-09 18:50:00,3229,Ontarios proposed New Plate slogan. They will change their mind when this gets out again.  
1042744,Woodsman,2019-04-09 19:50:00,1286,This whole issue is a waste of money. The costs to changing the name does nothing other than cost money not required to be spent.
1042783,16 Footer,2019-04-10 12:12:00,191,New plates for everyone? Are they going to peel off like the old ones?
1042789,woodenboater,2019-04-10 13:00:00,2277,peel ? I've seen some in Toronto that were deliberately trashed. they shld be pulled over and lose their license...and car impounded. grrr
1042792,Loonietoon,2019-04-10 13:36:00,1450,?☹️
1042794,Loonietoon,2019-04-10 13:39:00,1450,He cuts funding from much needed programs and wastes money on things that make no sense. Must be smoking the same stuff his Brother was on.?☹️
1043061,SirCranksalot,2019-04-15 02:27:00,3291,Totally unnecessary expenditure Does he think that industries will locate here because of that slogan??
1043064,irishfield,2019-04-15 03:33:00,26272,"So while we all piss and moan about a slogan change on future manufactured plates, who was the premier when they ""wasted our money"" and changed it from the perfect ""Keep it Beautiful"" to the current ""Yours to Discover""??  Maybe we should just go back to no slogan...   "
1043065,HTHM,2019-04-15 04:09:00,4082,That last one is as old as I am Wayne.
1043068,dave524,2019-04-15 10:25:00,4508,"Used to get new plates every year, think the sticker thing started about the mid 70's, had a 76 VW Rabbit when it started. I understand we are dropping the front plate too, only rear plates now."
1043070,lew,2019-04-15 10:49:00,12766,"The colour of the plates used to change every year too, blue plate with white letters one year then white plate with blue letters the next. Always thought that was such a waste of money."
1043072,dave524,2019-04-15 11:27:00,4508,"You sure wouldn't drive around with expired plates in those years, no names mentioned ?, they also all expired on the same day, not spread out throughout the year on birth months. "
1043076,SirCranksalot,2019-04-15 13:23:00,3291,I'm not sure who changed what slogan and when. Does it matter? 2 wrongs make a right? Why waste effort on such a trivial issue??
1043104,lew,2019-04-15 22:19:00,12766,Government now says we're keeping both plates on our vehicles
1043108,woodenboater,2019-04-15 23:39:00,2277,"yeah, only when police chiefs raised a stink. and imo, understandably so..."
