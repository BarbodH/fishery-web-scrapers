1042951,misfish,2019-04-12 20:29:00,29133,Never tried bouncing a tube on the bottom here. Always suspended and wait for the chase. Going to try this for them this year.

1043099,misfish,2019-04-15 20:34:00,29133,"If you are an experienced yaker,it is fun but can get interesting out there. I do not yak,but have a few buddies that are out there and they seem to handle waves with no prop,but they have been yakking for along time and are set up for conditions out there. One guy uses stabilizers. If I did get a yak,I would have them as well. I like the 2 big ones I have now on my toon.  Feel free to pm me if your interested in going out. I dont target them til the whities go deep."
