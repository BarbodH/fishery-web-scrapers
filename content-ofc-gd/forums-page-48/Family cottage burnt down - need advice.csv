1042037,Big Cliff,2019-03-27 12:56:00,6899,"First of all, sorry to hear this but I hope all will work out ok in the end! I am interested in following this one, my granddaughter just bought their first house, it closed on March 1. They had a bit of cleaning up to do before they moved in, just painting and stuff. Before they even spent a night in the place it burnt to the ground, fire marshal investigated and said it was an electrical fault caused by rodents chewing on wiring, fortunately they had insurance (haden't even made the first payment yet). I guess it's all covered but I'm not sure what the process is."
1042053,OhioFisherman,2019-03-27 15:00:00,6623,"Wow, the few pictures I saw look terrible, luckily no one was hurt. I can only imagine the hassles involved, especially if you have to deal with them from a distance? Even the foundation of the cottage may have damaged? A complete do over? Take pictures of wreckage and destroyed items? It may help determine initial value?"
1042055,FishFinder17,2019-03-27 15:08:00,139,We're all very lucky that my brother made it out. Also lucky that he didn't have his dog with him. 5 minutes after he got out the roof started collapsing He went back the next day to take pictures. Not a single thing is recognizable. Half of two walls are still up but its mostly just a pile of ash. Really hits home when you see the pictures and realize what was once there is now totally gone.
1042060,pike slayer,2019-03-27 16:36:00,1177,I worked doing rebuilds for service master for over 7 years and worked on a lot of burn homes. I've seen what people go through with the insurance. Insurance companies really push to just write you a cheque and wash their hands of it but its a lot less money then getting it rebuilt. You are in for a lot of headaches. The more documents the more pictures more receipts you have to prove what you had and the value the better chance at more money. They love to give you depreciation values of all your contents. To get it built your better off having someone like service master rebuild it you'll get your best value but it's the longest process. You'll be lucky to have your place done by the end of summer. For any advice pm me
1042086,GBW,2019-03-27 21:03:00,8460,"Pic's, pic's and bills of sale for as much as you can find!  A full inventory list as you go day by day adding to it when you have that ""oh shiiiii, I forgot to say..."" moment and a good adjuster will add things within reason.  And yes for fishing items the hooks, line, leaders, swivels and all those items lost do add up. I will second ServiceMaster as the guys from Peterborough helped my folks out and me out when I needed them."
1042088,cisco,2019-03-28 01:02:00,597,"Suggest you do a sketch of the floorplan and all spend time together remembering what was in each room, closet, shelf, cabinet, etc.. By following a plan like this you will remember more than by just listing things will nilly."
1042093,Sinker,2019-03-28 13:06:00,8692,"Wow, sorry to hear!"
1042112,FishFinder17,2019-03-28 17:46:00,139, Thanks Pike Slayer & GBW I'll definitely look into servicemaster Will be an interesting process to itemize an entire tackle box from memory. I do think I have some pics from when i boasted to friends about my new lure purchases
1042133,Snidley,2019-03-28 21:45:00,620,"Some one, like Pikeslayer, who has been through it more than once is a fantastic resource. The advice to get the family together onsight to go through every room is also on point. It's been years since I was involved with general insurance but I can say without reservation that if you let them they will low ball you EVERY TIME. That's one of the ways they get paid. It used to be that an independant insurance agent, as opposed to an employee of a direct writer like State Farm , Co Operators etc, would go to bat for you but I believe those days are  long gone. Independant insurance brokers often struggle with issues of loss ratio, and exclusion by underwriters that makes them company men as much as the employees of the big direct writers. The best is to have a close friend as your insurance representative be they employed by the big guys or as independant brokers canvassing multiple underwriters for the best deal.  I hope this all works out for you as I'm sure it's currently very stressfull"
1042527,billyshort,2019-04-05 12:36:00,8,"hey sorry to hear the bad news , anything like that is traumatic for all involved , I know of 2 or 3 great honest as the days long builders if you are in need , they work mostly in your area around the lakes building timber frame homes , I actually do all the finishing inside staining, painting ,and so forth, these are multi million dollar homes of course but they also build smaller cottages whatever the clients wishes, they are young guys terrific at what they do , Ive been doing business with them and their father for more than 25 years, so if you need a contact let me know   good luck   Bill"
1041999,FishFinder17,2019-03-26 16:00:00,139,"Hi OFC, Got some unfortunate news that our beloved Muskoka family cottage burnt to the ground yesterday - nothing left... I'm hoping I can help my parents out in any way possible but have no experience with insurance claims of this magnitude. Has anyone been through a similar experience? and if so, do you have any tips to share on dealing with insurance companies, maximizing your payout, minimizing timelines, etc? Some of the bigger questions I have - -How do we get the process moving as quickly as possible? What's a reasonable timeline to expect? 	-Will it make more sense to rebuild and sell a brand new cottage? Or take the payout and sell the lot? 	-How do we properly quantify the contents inside the cottage that should be covered (including my fishing gear)? Obviously there's a lot that goes into answering some of these questions and I don't expect to get all of the answers, but there's a lot of experience on this board that I'm hoping to tap into. Many thanks in advance for your help, FF17"
1042000,OhioFisherman,2019-03-26 16:14:00,6623,"Sorry about your families loss, never been thru anything like that, but pictures of the cottage and contents before the fire might help to establish the value?"
1042003,Snidley,2019-03-26 17:06:00,620,Don't go for the first offer from the insurance company. Quickest is almost never the best settlement
1042005,Canuck,2019-03-26 17:08:00,491,Call your insurance agent. They are not the insurance company. They work for you. They will tell you everything you need to know about the claim. They will need a list of contents and estimated age of each thing. So start making the list. They will want prove of ownership for as much as you can support but will cover other stuff too My advise is to avoid the temptation of saying you have something you didn’t. Your claim will go sideways fast if they show you misrepresented anything.
1042006,FishFinder17,2019-03-26 17:21:00,139,Thank you very much. We are currently collecting the pictures we have
1042007,FishFinder17,2019-03-26 17:21:00,139,Good advice! thank you
1042008,FishFinder17,2019-03-26 17:24:00,139,Thanks for the advice. Have already been in touch with insurance and just getting some details on next steps. Definitely want to keep things accurate. I'm more worried about forgetting to put something on the list than making something up. 
1042009,Terry,2019-03-26 17:40:00,14456,"it is almost always better to rebuild then settle if you settle they value the building at the value it was, if you rebuild they must build by todays standards and all new so much more value, much more money in your pocket when you sell. at least thats how it was for me i found the insurance company was easier to work with then the company i paid to rebuild, get into the agreement a firm finishing date with penalties for being late"
1042010,FishFinder17,2019-03-26 17:47:00,139,"Thanks Terry, I wasn't aware that there would be a difference between what insurance would payout in cash, and what they would pay to do the rebuild. Very good to know. How long did your rebuild take?"
1042011,Terry,2019-03-26 17:48:00,14456,year and a half
1042015,irishfield,2019-03-26 21:52:00,26272,"I didn't even think they'd pay and let you walk away anymore to avoid owner ""mortgage burning"" fires. I thought you had to rebuild...  Sorry about your parents mess there FF17... and I thought worrying if my roof was still there this winter was tough."
1042017,FishFinder17,2019-03-26 23:05:00,139,Thanks irishfield.  Just got the pictures of the aftermath and it is completely gone :(
1042018,Tjames09,2019-03-26 23:20:00,664,Sorry about the cottage. Any reason your looking to sell now? Id imagine rebuilt it'd be a nice new place. I don't know if insurance companies will offer a cash settlement and leave an empty lot; I actually think they will make you build something. Id imagine there would be stipulations stating something must be built; otherwise the insurance money could be spent on something it wasn't intended for.
1042019,lew,2019-03-26 23:27:00,12766,"Really sorry to hear about your cottage, that's lousy news. Hopefully the insurance company takes care of everything for you."
1042020,spincast,2019-03-27 00:01:00,3279,"Sorry to hear that. . Take a deep breath, the next little bit may be stressful, especially if you aren't used to these types of things. . I would start by reading the policy - every last sentence.  Every policy  is different. Assuming you have a broker (not with someone like TD or Belair direct), get your broker involved. So much depends on the policy, the quality of the company who wrote the policy, and even whether or not you have other policies with the same insurer.  Depending on the circumstances , you may want to contact a lawyer before you sign or agree to anything. If it don't feel right, it probably isn't.  And never lose sight that the insurance company is in it to minimise their payout while still meeting their legal obligation. Without understanding your coverages, very difficult to provide any guidance beyond that."
1042021,AKRISONER,2019-03-27 00:04:00,5558,i couldnt even imagine...wow sorry to hear man
1042022,chris.brock,2019-03-27 00:43:00,4053,"Not me, but my parents had the top of a big white pine break off in a windstorm and land on their cottage roof. Caved the roof, branches protruding through the roof and ceiling into the main room. It was a lot of hassle for my parents, and it took 2 years to get everything back to right, but the insurance company lived up to their obligations with some prodding. good luck"
1042024,craigdritchie,2019-03-27 01:12:00,1586,"The kind of payout the insurance company will offer depends what kind of policy the cottage was insured under. If it was insured under an Agreed Cash Value policy, then the company will pay out whatever value you  agreed upon when the policy was taken out, and that's it. If the cottage was insured under a Full Replacement Cost policy, then they will pay the full replacement cost, no questions asked. Former in-laws had a tree come down on their cottage. Full replacement cost policy. Repaired to like-new condition in six weeks. Talk to your agent, and good luck. Sorry for your loss."
1042026,OhioFisherman,2019-03-27 01:50:00,6623,"Fishfinder, was that the one in Gravenhurst?"
1042027,Old Man,2019-03-27 03:33:00,822,"Lost the bulk of our house to a tornado about 8 years ago. Your first challenge will be dealing with the adjuster. My advice is  to first determine the value of the property. Looking through local real estate pricing is your first start.  From there on, if you encounter problems with the adjuster and the company, you can always chose to bring in a public adjuster to work on your behalf. In my case, the mere mention of this course,  along with my expressed willingness to go to court for settlement suddenly brought about a quick a equitable settlement."
1042029,Chuck Enwinde,2019-03-27 04:39:00,247,I'd work on itemizing everything in and around the cottage that will need to be replaced.  There is virtually no way that you'll remember everything but everything lost has a replacement value - from the bed sheets to the utensils. I had to make a claim a few years back- forgot that each of the reels I lost had ~$25 worth of Powerpro on.  Best of luck.
1042033,FishFinder17,2019-03-27 12:48:00,139,Yes it was
1042034,FishFinder17,2019-03-27 12:49:00,139,Thanks Lew
1042035,FishFinder17,2019-03-27 12:49:00,139,"This is great, thanks. Didn't consider bringing in a public adjuster but that's a good plan to have if things go sideways."
1042036,FishFinder17,2019-03-27 12:51:00,139,"Thanks to everyone for all of the insights and advice. My family has read through this thread and we're all really grateful for the support. Please keep the comments coming, I really appreciate it. I'll keep everyone updated with our progress.  Thanks again, FF17"
