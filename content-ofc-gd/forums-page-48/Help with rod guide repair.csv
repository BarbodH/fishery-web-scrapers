1042449,captpierre,2019-04-04 00:30:00,2521,Noticed the first(biggest) travel spinning rod  guide ceramic insert has broken into several pieces and fell out . The guide itself is fine but the groove in which the ceramic ring sat in is sharp. Do I need to replace the whole guide or can I fill the groove with crazy glue or epoxy and sand smooth? I’m not looking for perfection. Just functional. What say you Gents?

1042452,DRIFTER_016,2019-04-04 01:52:00,10439,Just get the guide replaced. Won't cost you much. Drop into Angling Specialties and they will get you out and fishing in no time.
1042465,Spiel,2019-04-04 12:44:00,9065,Definitely get it replaced. 	If you were closer to Hamilton I'd do it for you. 
1042481,DRIFTER_016,2019-04-04 14:41:00,10439,Heck if he were closer to Yellowknife I'd do it.  ??
