1043395,crappieperchhunter,2019-04-21 19:45:00,2582,When my kids where small we went every year for the kids day. The one year a work buddies daughter won the chopper ride around the area. Neither him or his wife are flyers and I think they where more nervous about the ride  than  their  daughter was. A great event and I'm happy it's still going on.
1043399,David Chong,2019-04-21 20:20:00,836,Lots of memories have been made at this event! I used to spend my vacations in Orillia growing up as my aunt & uncle ran the Golden Dragon in town and we chased perch at the Orchard Point & Town docks! Great memories!
1043426,bigugli,2019-04-22 02:59:00,6138,Spent a lot of time there with the kids during perchfest. Often playing a little hookie from school for an extra day of family fun. Sadly the majority of shore spots are now privatized. So we stopped going.
1043432,David Chong,2019-04-22 11:39:00,836,"Yes, sadly although there are still some shore access, we have lost a lot! Probably the biggest loss was the Orchard Point Pier which I spent tons of time at as a kid! ???"
1043433,b2kptbo,2019-04-22 11:41:00,1505,"Attended the Perchfest numerous times over the years and was always a good time. One year had a gang of us on a buddies pontoon, was a blast..."
1043453,Rattletrap2,2019-04-22 19:43:00,1652,"David, The idea of Perchfest and all it stands for are great, but if they can't open up a decent amount of shore spots to fish from, it is very limiting. Always been a complaint of mine. The good people of Orillia really need to get their act together and open things up at least during the derby."
1043474,David Chong,2019-04-22 23:05:00,836,I actually do most of my fishing at this event from various shore spots.There is just not as many as previously available. The good people from Orillia have mostly the same issues when it comes to shore fishing! The loss of these areas are usually a result of a small minority abusing the privilege by littering and not repeating the properties of others.
