1042583,David Chong,2019-04-06 14:50:00,836,I would never take the insurance off my boat while in storage! Not worth it!
1042108,BillM,2019-03-28 17:21:00,17367, 
1042109,TJQ,2019-03-28 17:25:00,7806,OUCH!!
1042110,Fisherman,2019-03-28 17:29:00,7201,"Aye, a great big owie."
1042111,BillM,2019-03-28 17:29:00,17367,"I saw this over on LSMB, hoping no one here is affected.   That's just insane how much $$$ is laying under all that scrap metal."
1042113,lew,2019-03-28 17:47:00,12766,"jeeez, that's unreal !!"
1042114,OhioFisherman,2019-03-28 18:08:00,6623,"https://barrie.ctvnews.ca/dozens-of-boats-crushed-after-storage-facility-collapses-1.4354810 Wow, you wouldn't expect that from a building only about 1 year old?"
1042115,kickingfrog,2019-03-28 18:10:00,8333,If it's going to fail due to issues it's likely to happen early. 
1042127,irishfield,2019-03-28 19:40:00,26272,"Been a bad winter for that, with numerous marinas suffering the same fate. Temagami Marine lost 1/2 of a storage section 2 weeks back affecting about 24 boats. Bad Winter for snow load with temperature cycles locking the snow to steel roofs vs the usual shedding process. Even here the snow NEVER fell off my hangar or shop roofs 5/12 and 3/12 pitches."
1042252,bigbuck,2019-03-31 02:33:00,2449,Gonna be lots of great used parts for sale.... Isn't that the Marina right in Rosseau by the beach?? We boat up there and spend the day. A short walk up the hill takes you to a great chip truck that's been there for years. The General Store is great too.
1042256,Hack_Fisherman,2019-03-31 13:30:00,720,I wonder if many of these boats will go to a boat wrecker or if the insurance company will repair them. Maybe a mix of both?
1042289,HTHM,2019-04-01 04:53:00,4082,I have never seen a boat wrecking yard. Be nice to find some.
1042302,David Chong,2019-04-01 15:24:00,836,"WOW that's crazy, there's a few insurance claims there! "
1042303,misfish,2019-04-01 15:29:00,29133,There was a large one at the 8th line of Oro on hwy 11. It is gone now. Another small one in gasoline alley. Gone now as well.
1042335,Hack_Fisherman,2019-04-02 01:43:00,720,"There’s a few around. Innisville, Sunderland, Fenlon Falls to name a few"
1042352,mamona,2019-04-02 13:27:00,597,Is marina usually insured? I never asked for that...
1042354,BillM,2019-04-02 13:37:00,17367,No way the marina would be insured for those boats.  It's all on the owners.
1042363,OhioFisherman,2019-04-02 15:25:00,6623,"I have had a couple of friends lose boats stored at marinas, and I doubt if things are much different up there than here, keep your own insurance coverage on your boat all year! An ice jam on a river let go and washed away 40-60 boats store on cradles years ago, they hit the iron breakwall and sank, lot of stories in our papers here about it, people not carrying their insurance over the winter to save a few bucks. Another had his in a rack storage and a fire melted a bunch of them."
1042372,Old Ironmaker,2019-04-02 17:30:00,8243,I wouldn't depend on a storage facility to make good on an insurance claim. Always carry your own insurance. I am surprised at how many guys I know out here on Erie that don't insure their boats. I think they are nuts myself. Liability at the least. Buddy has a boat bone yard just west of Dunnville on Rainham Rd. I drove by yesterday and his 2 acre property is jammed packed. And I know his building is packed with every boat part he gets his hands on. PM me and I will hook you up if you are looking for a part.
1042377,bigbuck,2019-04-02 17:47:00,2449,I will keep that in mind. Hopefully this year's expenses are only cosmetic. I need some cushions Re - upholstered.
1042410,camillj,2019-04-03 12:23:00,1988,Wow ... I'm close by (at Minett) ... used to wonder whether it was worth the extra few bucks storing inside (heated) which i did the first few years vs shrink wrap outside ... feeling little better about about my choice now ... guessing the insurance rates may go up this year
1042413,Old Ironmaker,2019-04-03 12:45:00,8243,"Pro's and cons. I hate meeses to pieces. They love nice warm cubby hole', nooks and cranny's to bed down for winter. s"
1042414,camillj,2019-04-03 13:04:00,1988,"True ... they clean her up and ""spring-ize"" it before she goes in the water so I suppose I wouldn't know (what the eye doesnt see - the heart doesnt feel )"
1042446,Lape0019,2019-04-03 22:48:00,647,I’ve discussed this with a marina up here. They have insurance to cover their own in-stock boats but they do not carry insurance for people storing their boats at the shop. They make that very clear.
1042492,Old Ironmaker,2019-04-04 17:35:00,8243,"Off topic again but, I have always put Irish Spring soap  shaved with a peeler in small plastic containers with holes cut in them all around where I think mice like to make a nest, seat backs, up under seats and all around the fuse panels and where electrical raceways run under the gunnels. So far so good, 11 years."
1042557,Dartee,2019-04-05 20:22:00,47,Yikes
