Well, it's way too early for the fiddle heads (up here at least) and I didn't have much better luck with the crappie. I checked out a spot I know on Pigeon lake, water level is way too low yet and there is still plenty of ice on the lake. Cameron Lake had a few open spots but I couldn't get a bite. I was about to head over to check out a couple of spots I know on Sturgeon Lake when the sky opened up. Oh well we have a couple of warm days coming up and I think I'll check out Sturgeon Lake today, got to get me some fresh fish ?"
