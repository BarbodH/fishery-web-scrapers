1042548,porkpie,2019-04-05 18:33:00,2521,Do yourself a favor.  Push the bike into a field and light it on fire.  They are total heaps that will barely run when it's cold out.  I should know I had one and I hated every minute of owning it!

1042570,Old Man,2019-04-06 00:12:00,822,Also could be a stuck needle and seat due to varnish build up in the carb.

1042573,porkpie,2019-04-06 01:49:00,2521,"Yep Suzuki engines and it’s the only bad zuke I’ve ever come across.  No amount of  carb rebuilding, cleaning or fiddling with it would get it running right.  POS!!! And I’m a big zuke fan, so it’s hard for me to say it!"
1042575,cheaptackle,2019-04-06 02:27:00,849,Cracks or pinholes in the plastic tube.  Just a thought.  Michael
