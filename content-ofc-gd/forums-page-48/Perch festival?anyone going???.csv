1042767,porkpie,2019-04-10 00:42:00,2521,There is a free launch across from tudhope park off 12 south.  I haven’t used it in a few years but that’s always where I put in to fish that area.

1042772,bigugli,2019-04-10 02:18:00,6138,Have not been in years. Especially with so much shoreline in the area being posted.
1042788,Fisherman,2019-04-10 12:56:00,7201,"That reminds me, never did hear much about the Barrie fall perch festival either last fall."
1042817,davey buoy,2019-04-10 18:56:00,5505,"Never did see the 100 boats near centennial beach last fall either. Unloaded there before in Orillia ,kinda remembered parking across the street ,maybe a early morning road trip."
