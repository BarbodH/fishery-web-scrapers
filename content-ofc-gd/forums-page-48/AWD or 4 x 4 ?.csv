No matter whatever you chose every single brand has the known quirks to it . I see plenty in my dealership with over 200 used cars sold a month on top of new lucky me gets to see everything. I really wanted to bring that w10 Audi home ?

1041815,Rustic-Fisher,2019-03-21 12:44:00,826,"Ive had a bunch of 4x4s and AWD vechicles over the years Jeep Rubicons ,Xterra, ,RAMS , and Subarus.

BUT i gotta say I have taken the Subaru Outback 3.6 L through some sketchy stuff . I was amazed at how well it did with only the AWD.   We'll always have a Subaru parked in the driveway (on our 3rd) but for working and towing its the RAM hands down .  Now the jeep Rubicon was a different creature all together lol .

1041816,Sinker,2019-03-21 13:11:00,8692,"My forester XT was awesome off road as well, but they just don't stand up to it, and towing wears them out. My boat is maybe 1500lbs, and it tows it fine, and stops it no problem, but they are essentially a car, and just don't stand up to the wear and tear of towing OR offroading. I've had lots of big off road truck guys question what I was doing in my forester in some of the places I've had it. Then turn around and blow cars off the line running light to light. It was a fun car, but, its a car.  Gas mileage was absolutely horrible, and always burning premium fuel too......$$$$ S."
1041819,aplumma,2019-03-21 14:31:00,6896,"People who look at the basics of what a vehicle is should see a few things that transcend brand names. First the lighter a vehicle is and the smaller an engine is the better the gas mileage is. The heavier built the vehicle is and the larger the engine is the more gas you will burn. You can tow with a VW bug but it will be stressed past it's design and blow up shortly after hook up. The  physics of metals and lubricants will not completely over ride abuse. Design is also important in the drive train a transmission is designed to modify the stress on the engine while attempting to deliver the best ratio for fuel economy. That translates to a light SUV or car is not designed to take on heavy loads on a consistent bases. The enemy of all mechanical things is heat it is the great destroyer. If you want any mechanical item to keep functioning as long as possible give it the best lubricant you can, dissipate heat as best you can and do not exceed the design of the vehicle. If that sounds like a 4x4 truck then that is the correct answer or if you value fuel economy over performance or brute strength then a small SUV/ car is the ticket.  Art"

1041833,Old Ironmaker,2019-03-21 18:10:00,8243,Yes ec it can get confusing. I have no idea what you are saying but that's on me. Drifter I guess not AWD vehicles are equal. It's not fair to compare a Honda to a GM. Maybe a Vette but they can't pull a bicycle out of a ditch. It's strange that as humans we know more about what makes our vehicles run than we do our own bodies.
1041849,DRIFTER_016,2019-03-21 20:52:00,10439,You are 100% correct as it would be a huge insult to the Honda!!! ? I owned a GM once and will not make that mistake again.

Love the feature especially on intermittent  Snow/ice/ clear pavement.  Sometimes I forget it’s on auto which concerns me because the transfer case is still running. OP,  both are good  but it all boils down to your intended use.  I’m a strong believer that with the higher horsepower cars on the road now FWD isn’t good enough.  My wife’s car is absolutely Squirrley when passing Even on dry pavement. It’s definitely a white knuckler and should be AWD.  Anything 200 horse and up should be AWD imo ( regarding cars/SUV/crossover’s)"

Both come in 4x4 and are more than capable enough. For the hairy snow, definitely invest in snow tires, they will be more helpful than awd or 4x4."
1042394,DRIFTER_016,2019-04-02 20:53:00,10439,"100% correct!!! For 15 years I drove Honda Civics because of the amount of driving I did. Had dedicated snows for the winters and they made a huge difference in traction and handling. I have a good story driving home to the NWT from Alaska one year in my 2005 si. I had my snows on as I usually visit in September and October and it's common to have snow. Have even run into it on the drive there in early September. Anyway I was headed home from Alaska around T-Giving one year and while driving through interior Alasa in the mountains ran into snow. The roads were plowed but snow covered. I needed gas so pulled into this gas station that had yet to be plowed and no one had been to the pumps but the sign said open so I pulled in. I was pushing snow with the front bumper the entire way through the parking lot to the pumps. I filled up and headed inside to pay. You paid inside the bar/restaurant. There were a bunch of locals tipping back some barleys and looking at me like I had 3 heads. As I was walking back to my car through the foot of fresh snow on the ground I could just imagine the ole boyz placing bets on how soon I would be back for a push. I hopped in my Honda, put it in second and drove out of the parking lot with no wheel spin!!! Would have loved to see their faces."
1042406,16 Footer,2019-04-03 11:35:00,191,Yes I believe in snow tires and put them on every winter. I have talked with people who have put on snow tires for the first time on their vehicle for winter and were amazed at the improve traction.  AWD and 4 x 4 definitely improves forward traction in winter conditions but does not help braking on snow and ice.
1042424,DRIFTER_016,2019-04-03 14:49:00,10439,But 4X4 with winter tires is a whole nuther ball game. I won't even mention studded winter tires and 4X4. Yes we're allowed to run em up here.
1042476,mamona,2019-04-04 13:47:00,597,"Pretty interesting topic for me as well. No Ecodiesel, no hemi, what's good then?"
1042482,Fisherman,2019-04-04 14:48:00,7201,"Well every brand has their gremlins,  sometimes a real crap shoot.  I know some that drive the RAM with the 3.6 and they are quite happy with them, good mileage but I would check to see their towing capacity and not push it. You said your boats around 2-3K so that would be fine.    I have the Eco D and have no complaints, heck it gets better mileage than some cars even towing.   The rumour mill indicates the Ford 1/2 Ton diesels are starting to experience some emissions problems too."
1042493,Sinker,2019-04-04 17:40:00,8692,"I don't find my hemi hard on gas at all. Better than other full size 4x4 trucks, and even some SUV's. They are, and always have been, bulletproof engines. I'd buy another no questions. I hear more horror stories about the eco diesel to be fair. S."
1042582,Raf,2019-04-06 14:32:00,3495,Have a look at the colorado / canyons.  I am biased as i have the 2.8 diesel colorado and its an excellent truck that gets incredible fuel economy.  Drove to bellevile and back from west of orangeville and got 6.9 l / 100 - that's honda accord territory. The towing capacity and payload is slightly higher than a comparable ecodiesel ram. It has 4auto/hi/lo/2wd and a (auto) locking rear diff. I compared against the tacoma and frontier but those two now lag behind GM in this segment. Full time Awd biggest benefit is driving in snow.  A true 4x4 is not far behind and excels in conditions AWD gets stuck.
1042586,Sinker,2019-04-06 15:09:00,8692,"The canyons are nice for sure, but screw GM, and guys like me who are 6'4 don't fit in them so well. I need the space of a full size anyways. S."

1041728,lew,2019-03-19 15:51:00,12766,"I've got what's called ""4auto"" on my truck which is nice as it leaves the truck in rear wheel drive but as soon as the back wheels slip it automatically kicks into 4 wheel drive. Nice when driving on roads with a mixture of snow/ice & dry roads so you don't need to keep switching back & forth."
1041729,Lape0019,2019-03-19 16:14:00,647,"yeah, Depends what you're looking to do with it.  They all have a place and time. And not every AWD is the same either. I prefer a truck to be able to go RWD and then 4X4 hi/low or auto ( I have all options). It gives you more options. but to be honest, I have yet to need 4x4 when pulling my boat out of a launch. But... I tend to stick to decent launches.  My car however, I have AWD. It is great! I had always have front wheel before and the extra control is very noticeable. From what I recall, I believe my AWD is still rear wheel dominant with 60% of the power going to the rear wheels. If I put it into snow mode, it is supposed to make it 50/50."
1041737,16 Footer,2019-03-19 22:09:00,191,"Which truck has the best, reliable 4 x 4 and is reasonably good on gas?"

1041740,aplumma,2019-03-19 22:45:00,6896,"I run a 4x4 with hi, low and 4 wheel differential lock. I run it 90 percent in 2 wheel drive 5 percent 4x4 hi, 4 percent in 4x4 low and 1 percent in 4x4 low diff lock. The one percent got me out of an expensive tow bill. That said if you are going to be running the roads then AWD makes the most sense to me. The wife's escape has auto AWD and it is amazing in the snow (what little we get). If you plan on going off road or hauling then 4x4 is the way to go. If you talk to mechanics they can tell you the difference between the build and the durability of 4x4 VS AWD that is  found in most light duty trucks and SUV's. As far as gas goes, the bigger the engine and the heavier the vehicle the worse the mileage will be. You can't have it both ways which means you have to decide before you buy what is more important to you. Art "
1041751,irishfield,2019-03-20 01:03:00,26272,AWD is FUN.. don't tell the wife !! 
1041752,smitty55,2019-03-20 01:07:00,928,"I have that on my '01 Sierra as well but I'm super hesitant to use it. The idea of the drive train kicking into 4wd while rear wheels are spinning just screams to me asking for something to break. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't trust it. To me the most dependable was the locking hubs I had in my old 78 Chev. Nothing electrical to worry about, no solenoids to screw up and no front axles turning until I locked the hubs and engaged the front diffy. The old days eh hehe."
1041758,DRIFTER_016,2019-03-20 03:05:00,10439,This is how most AWD vehicles work. The computer senses wheel spin and reduces power to those wheels while adding or increasing power to the other wheels. It's pretty slick. 
1041759,Dutch01,2019-03-20 04:10:00,1431,Don't know about an '01 but on my '17 Silverado when you put it in auto it engages the front differential but doesn't send power to the front wheels unless it detects slippage at the rears. So it's not really kicking in and out of four wheel.
1041760,spincast,2019-03-20 09:42:00,3279,"if you want the most comprehensive analysis for new and used, consider buying this: http://www.lemonaidcars.com/. It also provides a complete list of all TSB and hidden warranties, and most common problems for each make and model. For what its worth, I picked up a Honda Ridgeline (AWD) a few years ago when they had a factory sale. I tow almost every weekend of the summer, both 2 quads and a 18 footer depending on the weather. I have just shy of 300k on it, still runs like the day I picked it up. I have replaced the right lower control arm the right  front axle, less than $1000 for the both combined - other than that, nothing but regular maintenance. It averages 12.9 combined not towing, and 17 combined towing and going to work.  On the trip to Nipigon and back it averaged 21 /100 with a full load, extra gas and two of us. Snow is no issue, and Fishmaster's ramp (if you've seen it, you know what I mean)  is no sweat. Not sure if I would buy a new one, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick a used one off lease with decent mileage."

1041764,Old Ironmaker,2019-03-20 10:40:00,8243,"I've had both. My vote is 4X4 by far for what I need it for. Snow and ice road conditions, the occasional steep slippery boat ramp and driving a farms back 40 once in a while.  I have had to pull a few folks from the ditch or stuck in a snow drift and I know that the AWD wouldn't do the job 4 low will. Last winter during a bad storm here along the lakeshore I came across a AWD vehicle in a ditch. The driver passed me doing about 80KPH and we were doing about 40 to 50KPH. The young lady in the AWD something or other was surprised she lost control because after all it was an AWD vehicle. I could have pulled her out but was dressed in my Sunday best and didn't have any ""pull a AWD out of the ditch"" clothing with me. I gave her the number for CAA."

1041767,Tom S,2019-03-20 14:21:00,362,"What you need is Russian 4x4 -> The Greatest Soviet Car I had a discussion once with a fellow who owned a pair of Ladas. He said it was the best snow plow vehicle he had ever driven - lock the center diff, put it in low, and drive through anything. Nothing would stop it. He even towed another car on a trailer through the mountains with one - start off in low, shift through the gears, pop it out of low, rev match and put in high, work through the gears. Once you're up to speed pray that nothing forces you to stop so you have to go through the whole process again. Downshift to slow down, don't trust the brakes. I guess the only downside is it scored a 0 out of 4 in Russian Safety Standard testing. Make what you will of that."
1041780,Sinker,2019-03-20 18:28:00,8692,"What do you hope to do with it? Ive had both. My subaru was great, but its nothing like real 4x4. The awd (especially subaru) were horrible on fuel (15-16l/100km from a 2.5l 4 cylinder engine!!) My 17 ram gets better mileage. If you plan to tow a 2-3000lb boat a fair bit, get a truck. Sure, a smaller AWD vehicle will do it, but it wears on them a lot more than with a truck, and they work much harder.  Having both, i take the truck 100% of the time, and i dont mess with auto 4wd either, if there is any crap on the roads, im in 4 high all the time. Your better to use it than not to. Ive seen more problems from guys never using 4x4 than i have guys who use it all the time.  IF fuel mileage is your concern, still go with a truck...lol....they are all very fuel efficient theae days. I average about 13l/100km, and i am towing a trailer at least once a week, abd i have a heavy foot. I can get that down to 11l/100km easy if i keep my foot out of it and slow down a little.  S."
