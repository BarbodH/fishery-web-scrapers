1042538,ketchenany,2019-04-05 15:18:00,3229,"here you go. reputation. ... If you are considered trustworthy and kind, you have a good reputation. Reputation comes from the Latin word reputationem, which means ""consideration."" It's how people consider, or label, you — good or bad. The noun reputation can also mean ""being known for having a specific skill or characteristic."" "
