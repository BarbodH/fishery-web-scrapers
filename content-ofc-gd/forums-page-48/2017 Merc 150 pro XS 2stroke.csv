1043339,Pangle,2019-04-20 11:33:00,64,Hi I’m close to buying a used merc 150 pro xs 2 stroke. Does anyone have experience with this motor. I’ve researched everything online and it sounds reliable and performance shouldn’t be an issue.  The main thing I’m wondering is fuel economy.  Im not a speed demon and won’t run WOT too often. Will it be a pig? Thx
