I have the pedestals so just need the seat itself x 4 I've looked online and there are a few good options at Cabela's and Sail but wondering if there's anywhere else I should be looking? I'm hoping to spend no more than $150 a seat. Looking for something high back with good cushion and aluminum hinges (rather than plastic) Any recommendations are appreciated. Thanks, 	FF17"
1043137,AKRISONER,2019-04-16 15:12:00,5558,id be ordering online. When the time comes thats how I will be getting mine.
1043138,FishFinder17,2019-04-16 15:17:00,139,Have you found anywhere specific? Or will you go with bass pro/cabelas/sail?
1043140,OhioFisherman,2019-04-16 15:52:00,6623,"I had a 17 foot aluminum side console, when I replaced my seats I got them from Cabela's and since them and bass pro are now 1 owner? Chances are the selection is pretty much the same? as are the prices?"
1043141,lew,2019-04-16 16:00:00,12766,Gotta be at least a decade since I was last in Bass Pro (Vaughn) but it seems to me they used to have a decent selection of seats in stock.
1043143,Lape0019,2019-04-16 16:17:00,647,"bass pro has them but if I were to order new seats that weren't from the factory or have them custom made, I would be looking at bassboatseats.com . they've goit a few options."

1043158,DRIFTER_016,2019-04-16 17:41:00,10439,I need to replace mine on my boat. Most of them are now completely saturated because of my little sinking issue last summer. One survived by being on a raised deck with a pedestal. So I too am looking for a set of 4 but may wait until next year as I just dropped a grand on a hydraulic steering system to replace my cable steering. The cable filled with water and froze so I don't know if it was still going to be usable so made the decision to upgrade. If the old one is usable I will install it on my friends boat or on another boat I own. 
1043197,DanD,2019-04-17 11:28:00,2223,"Have a look on Amazon. Here's some that seems to meet your requirements? With a few different colour combinations. I just used ""folding boat seats"" in the search bar. Many also offer free shipping. Here's a link Wise company seats  Dan."
1043206,AKRISONER,2019-04-17 13:17:00,5558,"amazon definitely has some great options, personally for me in a bass boat I am also looking at the BBC boards sponsor https://www.bassboatseats.com/"
1043216,OhioFisherman,2019-04-17 15:44:00,6623,"As I recall Wise seats were what I replaced mine with, didn't have any issues with them. https://www.cabelas.com/browse.cmd?categoryId=734095080&CQ_search=boat+seats&CQ_zstype=REG Don't know who makes their seats, but more options? "

1043285,AKRISONER,2019-04-18 20:55:00,5558,"turns out bass boat seats.com is directly affiliated with this guy. Same stock, just canadian supplier! Probably where I will end up getting my boat seats from."
