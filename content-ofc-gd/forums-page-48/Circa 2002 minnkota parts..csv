1031983,pidge,2018-07-31 02:09:00,438,"Hello all haven't posted in many years, but still fish when time allows....the long and short I'm looking for the locking clamp piece of a minnkota 50lbs from the year 2002. Mine has broke and was just throwing it out there as a last ditch effort to see if anyone had one that was pooched, but the plastic bits were still good. Any help? I'm currently using a ratchet strap, but that's becoming a pain in the you know what. According to minnkotas website that part isn't available anymore....for what it's worth, it's a bow mount ""power drive"". 12 volt. Thanks, Greg."
1031985,OhioFisherman,2018-07-31 02:57:00,6623,Since I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about I can only suggest this as a possibility?  https://www.ebay.com/b/Minn-Kota-Trolling-Motor-Components/124105/bn_580037
1031988,Chuck Enwinde,2018-07-31 05:50:00,247,Give Aikmans in Mississauga a call.  He`s been repairing Minn kota`s for a long while and probably has some old parts laying around.  +1 905-277-3595
1032027,pidge,2018-07-31 23:47:00,438,"-Chuck I didn't even think of that and sent a guy there yesterday for a Muskie reel repair. Duh!! do I feel foolish lol. In defence to that I didn't know he dabbled in trolling motors. Thank you for the tip. -OhioFisherman thanks for the link, but I've gone thru it already...the part it's hard to explain without a picture and I'm not computer saucy as I once was , it's the part that disingauges the shaft to be slid and holds it firm while travelling. Side note I suck at explaining sometimes...it has a handle piece that's sorta like a sled pull start handle if that makes sense at all??hope I came across somewhat clear in the decription. Thanks. -Greg"
1032029,OhioFisherman,2018-08-01 00:18:00,6623,"Greg, never had anything but cable steer models and a tiller model, no idea what the others even look like, and it's been a long time since I have even seen one. "
1032034,KraTToR,2018-08-01 01:45:00,506,Talk to Tyler at Rocky's in Orillia. He has tons of parts on hand.  You may just get lucky.
1032044,Lape0019,2018-08-01 14:03:00,647,"I am pretty sure I know what you are talking about and I am also pretty sure the only way you coul replace that originally was to purchase the whole motor housing. At least that is what it looks like for the V2 model of the powerdrive. My dad still has one of these motors which is why I can somewhat picture what you are looking for. Unless you can find an original Powerdrive to source parts from, I fear you will not be finding what you need. As this piece pretty much locks the trolling motor into the Stowed position and you are getting tired of the ratched strap, have you thought of something like a ram mount? I used one of theses with my Terrova and other than dropping part of it in the lake once (Okay... Twice...) it worked great. This would ensure your motor did not deploy when you dont want it to. That's the only option I can honestly think of."
1032052,pidge,2018-08-01 16:18:00,438,"-Krattor thanks for the heads up, another source. Thanks. -Lape0019, it is the piece that keeps it stowed when in motion. I haven't thought of the Ram mount idea that's something I'll look into. I tried a mount from a buddy's ATV and it still hasn't me worried, but I will look into the Ram mounts. Thanks. -Greg"
1032053,DRIFTER_016,2018-08-01 16:34:00,10439,"Yeah, one of these would hold it in place. https://www.cabelas.com/product/boating/electric-trolling-motors/electric-trolling-motor-accessories/pc/104794380/c/104716980/sc/104312880/ram-reg-tough-claw-trolling-motor-stabilizer/2171478.uts?slotId=11 "
1032072,Lape0019,2018-08-01 20:23:00,647,Looks like I totally forgot to add the link in. The one I had for the Terrova was very similar to what Drifter posted with the exception of it was held on to the TM shaft by an O clamp.  This is the one I used. https://www.rammount.com/part/RAM-108U  You will never have to worry about it deploying while in motion once you tie it down.
1032083,Raf,2018-08-02 00:47:00,3495,"I think you're talking about the below ""Claw"".  As mentioned, Rocky's in Orillia would be the first place I'd call "
1043299,pidge,2019-04-19 09:18:00,438,"Very late update: Krattor & Raf...thanks guys. Rocky’s had the part and shipped it out, the pin and spring as well. Thanks once again I’d never of found that place without your help. Great service to boot. -Pidge"
1043302,AKRISONER,2019-04-19 12:26:00,5558,"Send Jimmer a message, he’s got multiple kotas around for parts, unless his wife made him trash them lol"
