1043025,206,2019-04-14 12:32:00,563,"Not looking for spots, but how far of a run from a launch would it be to get onto the good ones?"
1043026,David Chong,2019-04-14 12:37:00,836,"Sorry, they had some issues with the webinar, here is the new link on YouTube - Enjoy!"
1043037,OhioFisherman,2019-04-14 15:41:00,6623,"At Presque Isle? https://www.fisherie.com/Presque-Isle-Cascade-Creek-Map https://charts.noaa.gov/OnLineViewer/14835.shtml The top link shows a number of launches, the only one I ever used was the marina lake one, it is in the park which is the entire north side of the bay. The bay is only around 5 miles long and a mile wide? The south side is the city of Erie. It's been some years for me 206, but the ramp was good and with it in the park there were more patrols, so more safety? As I recall the entrance to the park was gated, it opened at like 6 am? I can't recall ever fishing there before mid to late June though and only a couple of times fun fishing, most were part of our club's tournament schedule. We always limited our tournies to inside the bay itself and imposed a 3 fish limit there, it almost always took a minimum of 10 - 15 pounds to stand a chance. Some nice largemouth there too."
1043039,Pigeontroller,2019-04-14 16:36:00,2793,To the N.Y. side of the Niagara River isn't far...
1043045,misfish,2019-04-14 19:52:00,29133,"Shoot up from Chippawa. What a blast of a ride. Ask David to take ya up,he goes balls to the wall,drives it like he stole it.  The ride back is just as much fun. LOL"
