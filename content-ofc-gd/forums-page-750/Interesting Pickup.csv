So I picked it up at looked at the rod's label which said ""Trueline by Gordie Howe"" & very legible. Gordie Howe back in the 60's was associated with The Eatons Department Stores - as young person I had several pieces of hockey Trueline equipment endorsed by Mr. Howe (made by Cooper) including my helmet & shin guards but I never knew Howe endorsed other types of sporting goods. Anyways I bought the fishing rod for $2.00 & will match it up with an old Zebco push button reel that I have. I guess the rod must be at least 45 years plus in age.........."

I think they had a training camp near there and left there families there during the week. Johnny Bower was also there along with a few others."
