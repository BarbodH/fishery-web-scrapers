415071,spooner_jr,2009-12-24 15:00:00,193,"  I usually just use 2 different size wooden dowels, and drill the larger one out to act as a handle.  The advantage this has over the door spring type is you are able to pick it up out of the holder, disadvantage is you have to use a drop shot type setup, with the sinker on the bottom."
414470,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 15:04:00,0,"  the line is a large spool of depth coloured ice  line, held by rubber washer, bolt and wingnut.  i imagine you could use any type of spool as long as you attach it well.  i'd recommend something fairly large in diameter to make it easier to reel up.  winding 100 feet of line by hand onto a small spool isn't fun.  it is never really locked.  the idea is that if a fish grabs the bait, you want it to be able to swim with it.  we used to try and tighten the wingnut so that it had enough resistance to not freespool out uncontrollably while still letting a swimming laker or pike take the bait."
414472,troutboy,2009-12-22 15:09:00,125,"Thanks,I dont relly know what I was trying to say,another brain fart!  How dose the door stopper get mounted on the dowel and hockey stick? Ive never done this so thats why I have all these stupid questions!"
414473,troutologist,2009-12-22 15:09:00,951,Those are classic...put a bell on the end and its music to me out on the trout lakes.  I've seen regular large spools of line rigged with a small piece of dowl to facilitate reeling in. These were just hot glued on.
414479,canadadude,2009-12-22 15:18:00,769,"Another modification I've done to set tension on the spool is take a lid from a plastic margerine container cut a hole in the center and put this on bolt glue it to the hockey stick then mount the spool line on the bolt. When you set the tension the plastic lid against the spool will give enough friction that it's almost freespooling, it also keeps the line from getting in between the stick and the bolt."
414480,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 15:18:00,0,a prime mod!
414484,splashhopper,2009-12-22 15:25:00,2931,  Thanks doc.... i have to go to my storage shed today and am pretty sure I have everything there I need there...except the ice line.... I will grab that at the tackle shop.....should i grab two spools of different strength... ie  perch and pan fish.... vs trout and pike?   thanks again for the quicks responses...  appreciate it
414485,splashhopper,2009-12-22 15:27:00,2931,"  yeah... me twooo  PS.. pretty sure I could just scrw the door stopper on with a 1"" wood screw though."
414488,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 15:37:00,0,"having two spools would be a great idea i think.  there is a baseplate that the door spring kind of screws into...simply mount the base of the stopper to the hockey stick, then screw in the stopper without the rubber piece on the end.  you might have to whittle down the dowel to get it to fit in the door stopper.  my dowels aren't fastened with anything....they are whittled down until they just fit into the door stopper, and pushed in as far as possible.  the nice thing is that you can unscrew the dowel/spring off the hockey stick to put it in your backpack."
414491,splashhopper,2009-12-22 15:42:00,2931,thanks doc..... i am gonna try to make one in the next couple of days.... and put up a pic... hopefully with me on the ice.. and fish dangling from the end...
414508,troutboy,2009-12-22 16:22:00,125,Great idea!  Ill try that too!
414517,walleyejigger,2009-12-22 17:51:00,876,"instead of using a dowel with an eyelet on it i use old broken fishing rods, i usually try to get 2-3 eyelts on one length, for a spool/reel just go to a tackle shop and they sell the plastic ones (for making tip-ups) for a couple bucks, a bracket screws to your rod/hockey stick with a small bolt stiking out, spool, plastic washer and plastic wing nut over the bolt and tighten to how much tension u want or free spool, i think i paid 2 bucks a piece at bps last year, u can get some with rattles in the spool"
414562,troutboy,2009-12-22 20:27:00,125,Great idea
414567,Woodsman,2009-12-22 20:42:00,1286,"I just finished making a similar one. I inserted a short piece of rod tip into the dowel. For the main post instead of a hockey stick I used a large diameter piece of dowel. The reason for this is I can now use a wood hole bit to drill a hole in the ice for the post to slip into. On warmer days for a hockey stick post, packing in slush does not work too good if the slush does not freeze. I also used a plastic reel for tip-up purchased at WalMart for $3. When paint dries and final assembly is finished I'll post a picture. Most likely tomorrow.  Rick"
414578,troutboy,2009-12-22 21:39:00,125,"Good to hear you started! I still have to get some dowels,and the door stoppers most likly tomorrow!"
414637,walleye_man,2009-12-23 00:11:00,135, i made of of these today i just cut the tip of a rod off that i was gonna throw out looks pretty good im gonna start makeing more of them
414640,GBW,2009-12-23 00:16:00,8460,"Your idea Rick gave me a good use for an old cut down broom stick I have kicking around.  I had a 2-pack of door stopers (not sure why either) so now all I need is the smaller dowel for the tip.  I figure I can use old spent line spools as my spool.  all I need to do is drill a hole in part of one of the crossings and stick a zip-tie trough, close the loop and use it as my handel.  thanks for all this info in this thread!  COME ON JAN 1 2010!!!!!!"
414787,troutboy,2009-12-23 14:12:00,125,Broom stick seems like a good idea!
414809,Woodsman,2009-12-23 17:17:00,1286,Here's the picture of the one I just finished.  Hoping to try it out soon.  Rick
414824,troutboy,2009-12-23 18:09:00,125,"Thats awsome!!   Im going to try somthing like that out!  I just got another idea,instead of using a dowl for the ""rod"" im going to use a old arrow shaft!It will fit in the door stopper and ill beable to fit a fishing rod tip in to one of the ends!"
414828,Woodsman,2009-12-23 18:23:00,1286,I doubt the arrow shaft will fit in the door stopper. Even the thin dowel I used for the shaft required whittling down to fit in the stopper.
414831,Muskieman,2009-12-23 19:07:00,2472,EH!!!  I've also been using that particular doorstop setup for 20 years or more... some designs have come and gone.. I have a few modified versions of it.... here's one that I made out of a busted rod tip and an older ultra light reel.  RFS     
414832,fishinguypat,2009-12-23 19:11:00,547,can regular mono be used for ice fishing?
414838,troutboy,2009-12-23 19:24:00,125,"You can use regular mono,but it tends to freeze up and twist,by the way nice tipup!"
414965,wallyboss,2009-12-24 03:36:00,1095,Remember tha the longer the dowel the more sensitive it will be. I had made a few of those and had different lenght dowels depending on the targetted species.  But now I use these way more sensitive and adjustable.  
414975,Sinker,2009-12-24 04:16:00,8692,I just use a slip float on my second rod.  S.
414191,troutboy,2009-12-21 17:26:00,125,"Iam just wonder how to make homemade tip ups,or tipdowns.I kinda got a plan but its not that detailed.      http://www.ehow.com/how_4827475_build-tipd...ce-fishing.html"
414195,richyb,2009-12-21 17:48:00,774,I just use a coat hanger and an elastic on a home made jigging stick and set it in a stand  You should be able to adjust the balance by moving your coat hanger each way so that the bait falls or raises slow so that the fish dont feel much resistance.
414196,Woodsman,2009-12-21 17:52:00,1286,Tip-ups/tip-downs is such a broad term. There are many different designs of which some work better than others for different situations. Let us know on what type/types of fish your targeting and if you are in a hut or in the open. Then maybe we can give you some suggestions on the better types of tip-ups for you. IMO the plan/design you have posted is one of the poor designs. The weight of the reel constantly holds up the arm. This will not be sensitive to light bites & will not react at all to a bait being lifted off the bottom like whitefish tend to. For fish like pike that run with the bait it should be OK.  Good luck: Rick
414199,rylan,2009-12-21 17:55:00,134,"The easiest way to make a tip up is this:  Grab a few 2x4's... cut to size -- normally about a foot or so-- both pieces  ( the height above the water) then connect them with some screws- Make a T. At the top of the T, drill a hole. Place a spool of ( whatever ) line with a screw- Dont have it to tight. Done.  As you are making your way out on the ice-- make sure you pick up a few long but flexible sticks.  Drill your hole, place the tip up with the T and line facing the hole. Drop the bait in the water. Once you are at the depth you want, make a loop in the line and place the loop on the stick. The stick should act as your rod. You may want to place something red or orange on the line, as an indicator -- Wait---  If you go to your local home hardware store-- pick up a 12 foot 2x4--- go to the dollar store and buy some cheap line- You can almost make 10 tip ups for under 30 bucks...."
414223,troutboy,2009-12-21 18:53:00,125,"Thanks! Im targetting brookies and walleye with no shelter,im thinking of just buying some windproof tipups instead of going thru all the frustration and time on making them,im still open to some ideas on makin' them!"
414224,richyb,2009-12-21 18:55:00,774,"Leechman made some pretty nice ones, maybe he can hook you up with some plans."
414230,troutboy,2009-12-21 18:58:00,125,Thanks! Ill give him a shout!
414239,wil wegman,2009-12-21 19:22:00,17,"Re: Thanks! Im targetting brookies and walleye with no shelter,im thinking of just buying some windproof tipups instead of going thru all the frustration and time on making them,im still open to some ideas on makin' them.  IF I were in your shoes ... that's exactly what i would do as well.  HT Makes the Windlass Tip Ups that keep your bait moving with even the slightest breeze and these are great. When the temps get way too frigid (likely quite often in TBay) you'll appreciate the no-freeze qualities of their Polar Tip's.  I don't know of any homemade jobs that can match the features of either and they're well worth the money.  Wil"
414244,richyb,2009-12-21 19:52:00,774,  I have both the windlass and the polar tip ups and prefer the polar ones. I have had the windlass freeze up and even on windy days I cant get alot of action goin anyways.
414246,troutboy,2009-12-21 19:58:00,125,"Thanks,ill probaly pick up some polar tipups on boxing day when there cheap  thats the bonus of boxing day,everythings on sale!  Have a merry christmas!"
414278,Leecher,2009-12-21 22:03:00,7832," Hey ya Chris,  here's how you make your own tipups..... you'll require some tools before you start this project  and here is the list of items required:  1.  Band saw 2.  Press drill with 3/32"" & 1/2"" bit 3.  Jigsaw with fast cutting blade 4.  Sand paper (coarse and fine) 5.  2"" finishing nail 6.  Metal eye (screwing type) 7.  Plastic reels (Wall Mart sells them for $2.99 - $4.99 each depends if they're on sale or not) 8.  Paint & paint brush 9.  1 - 1"" x 2"" x 4' strip of pine ( be selective..... get yourself to straightest piece)  Step 1  Proceed in cutting the 1""x 2"" into 23"" length. This will give you your base and top. Using the jigsaw, score the top of one of the 1"" x 2"" you just cut across about 1/2"" to 3/4"" deep in the middle. Using a piece of coarse sand paper, folded in 2, enlarge the mark by passing the paper into it. You will have to fold it again so that the nail can be inserted freely. Test as you go. You can also use a routing table with a special bit to accomplish this task..... much more precise with the guides on the table  Step 2  Proceed in creating the notch at the top of the base. Measure 2"" down and drill a hole in the middle using the 1/2"" bit. See picture below:    Now you'll be able to use the band saw and cutout the rest of it. See results on next picture:    Step 3 (The top)  The top can be really simple by cutting the piece in half and adding the plastic reel or you can be creative like I do and make some pretty cool design shown on the pic below:    For the special design, remember to leave 4 1/4"" at the back to be able to add the plastic reels.  Once you have made the top to your likings, hold the top piece vertically center on your forefinger so that it's perfectly balanced and mark the spot on the piece......  from that mark, measure & mark in 1/4 inch intervale 9 more toward the back of the piece.... this will give you different settings from light to heavy.  Using the the press drill and 3/32"" bit,  proceed in punching the holes See pic below:    Step 4 (the paint)  You are now ready for painting.... apply 2 coats of white water based paint and once dry, coat the top with a dark color leaving the base white..... this will help when you are fishing and a fish strikes.....  apply 2 coats of water based varnish to protect the pieces.  Step 5 ( the final installation )  Now all you need to do is install the reel, see pic below:    and the screw on eyelets.  I usually add 2 of them, 1/2"" from the end and in the middle but that one is optional.  Hope this helps you out and please post your results if you make some..... would like to see your design  Here's a few more pics from the last ones I made last year:      Leechman"
414323,troutboy,2009-12-22 00:29:00,125,Thanks leechman! Going to try them out!
414384,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 03:32:00,0,"my home made tips were made of an old hockey stick, a bathroom door stopper spring, a wooden dowel, an eyelet, and a spool of ice fishing line...  very simple, very sensitive, and very visible."
414386,Leecher,2009-12-22 03:34:00,7832, Your welcome Chris!!!
414389,fishinguypat,2009-12-22 03:39:00,547,"i have a plan to make a cheap tip up...i have some cheap line laying around 15 pound test on a big wide spool... couls i tie my lure directly to the spool ,drop it down, then just put a circular stick through the spool so if a fish comes it could let out line?"
414391,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 03:46:00,0,"i apologize for this artists rendering, but it was a simple design that performed well up north for lake trout.  "
414402,Woodsman,2009-12-22 06:46:00,1286,Dr. S that is a good type. I'm in the process of building one quite similar.
414428,anders,2009-12-22 14:12:00,1168," thats what i am using to Lucas...the exact same set up.  Works well for me for everything from perch to lakers and specks to eyes.  My buddy modified his though....he uses pvc pipe and a dowling as well...however, he put a fuse or something on the top so when the dowling went down a certain distance it triggers the fuse and makes a sound and the top will light up.  I think the light is a light from an over.  Works great...especially when your not paying attention or for eyes at night."
414433,splashhopper,2009-12-22 14:22:00,2931,"  Hey Doc..... what is holding the line at the end of the dowel?  Looks like a swivel of some sort.   I might try this... just for the helluv it. I don't think my wife will notice a doorstop missing either !  But I will tape one of the 3"" throw away glow sticks on the end as well"
414437,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 14:24:00,0,i'm not sure it's application beyond fishing (like it matters) but on the end of the tip ups is a small screw in eyelet.
414439,troutboy,2009-12-22 14:26:00,125,"Thank you Dr salvinius!  Another great idea to try!  Do you have to set it down,then when the fish bites it sets the hook?"
414461,canadadude,2009-12-22 14:51:00,769,"These tip-ups work great, I've been using these for years, I've modified mine with an eye midway down the dowel but it really isn't needed. Like said before these tip-ups work for all species. The only other thing I use in a pinch is an Alder twig an a spool of line good ole school method."
414463,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 14:56:00,0,"  hey.  not sure what you mean.  the bottom of the hockey stick is generally stuck into the snow...when a fish bites the sensitive bathroom stopper allows the dowel to bob up and down, without barely any resistance...  if you mount your line properly it will be allowed to spool out line if you have a fish take the bait and swim as they so often do...  when  a fish bites you just grab the line."
414466,splashhopper,2009-12-22 14:58:00,2931,"  What is the ""reel"" that you have there?  And how does it stay ""locked"" while still fishing?  Thanks again. "
414468,anders,2009-12-22 15:00:00,1168,"IM not sure about the doc...but on mine...all i have through the spool of line is a small nut and bolt....i can keep it tight, or reel loose depending on the species im fishing for...and i use the exact same set up."
