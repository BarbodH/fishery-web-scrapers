414606,irishfield,2009-12-22 22:41:00,26272,"All that is covered under the house policy liability. If they take a header off the trailer tongue.. the house policy will be in effect for the lawsuit from the Nancy next door that wants to get rich instead of disiplining their brat for cracking their head open.  Boat coverage itself... if you can afford for someone to hook up to it and leave on you.. take the insurance off. If not then it's cheap ""insurance""."

414784,Fish4Eyes,2009-12-23 14:04:00,1022,"Get a coupler lock, a wheel lock, and turn the boat into a position where the thief would need to move it considerably to get to it and I think your good. If your real worried, raise it up on jacks and even remove the wheels off the trailer."
414793,justin elia,2009-12-23 14:38:00,151,"Just got this quote from State Farm, No lay up period too.  ""Here are the details.  The boat:  $30,000 Amount  Liability $2  mill  Ded: $2000  Total Annual cost $559.82 tax in""  Your policy should only be about $150 per annum.  Unless I missed something or you've had previos claims, I would cancel your existing policy and get a new one."
414798,craigdritchie,2009-12-23 15:21:00,1586,"Beyond that, you may not be able to get a new policy come spring. Most insurance companies no longer offer seasonal coverage, and take a dim view of people who create their own by simply canceling their policy in late fall or early winter. In spring, they may refuse to cover your boat. Or, as GCD says, they may charge you much higher rates as a result.  It's not a good idea to list the boat on a rider to your house policy, since any claims on the boat (like hitting the lower unit on a rock) will directly affect your house coverage. Keep the boat on a separate policy with full replacement-cost coverage. If you only have cash-value coverage, you will be in for a shock if you ever make a claim. Hit a rock with your lower unit and they will only cover the depreciated, pro-rated value of your old lower unit. If they figure it's worth $250, and a new one costs $2,000, then you're left on the hook for the difference. When people say they got screwed by their insurance company, this is usually why. Full replacement cost coverage only costs a microscopic amount more (like maybe five percent more), but it is worth every penny.  If your boat is over 20 feet or has an engine over 50 hp, it's best if you deal with a broker that specializes in boat insurance. Robertson & Robertson (Toronto) or Northstar Marine Insurance (Barrie) are both pretty good."
414799,charlesn,2009-12-23 15:24:00,551,"Not really totally related vinnimon but a cautionary tale for all boat owners.  My 2nd boat, I had insured for less than full replacement.  Figured ""what could possibly happen"" since I am extremely safe and gentle with all my possessions and yet when something did happen in spite of everything I did, I ended up out of pocket for wanting to save a few (and I mean a few) dollars a month on insurance.  Saw it happen also to a young guy this fall.  Boat fell apart, but was worried that boat was underinsured as he was trying to keep the premiums down.  Saving those few dollars a month will not add up to what it will cost you if you do end up needing that ""insurance policy"" whether it is theft, fire, vandalism, etc.  Also, like the guys above say, sounds like you are paying far too much for the amount you have insured."
414818,asdve23rveavwa,2009-12-23 17:43:00,2690, I am also with State Farm...paying less than $20 a month for a $6000 boat...sounds like you are paying way too much!!

415286,fish_fishburn,2009-12-25 04:20:00,1311,"Hi Vinnie, Take my advice. Keep your policy current. I lost my bass boat in a garage fire a few years ago along with two other bass boats. All three boats were severely damaged mine was a right off. Thank gad we all had insurance or we would of been screwed. My carrier had to pay me out 30,000.00 and let me keep the boat. I was paying 60.00 a month for 30,000.00 coverage. Oh yeah and in the mean time you should be looking for a new company because I think they are hosing you bad. I think its better to have a seperate policy for your boat and not tying it in with your home car etc. Its called a vessel policy. It usually costs more but when theres an incident like I had they had it settled in about two weeks. My other two buddies had theres insured under there home policy and they were fighting for months, and one of them got screwed by a lousy settlement. Just my 2 cents."

My insurance is $160 for the whole year, with Total Replacement Coverage, and $500,000 liability.  With TRC, if I total my boat when it's 10 or 15 years old, I get what I paid for it, not what it's current blue book value is."
