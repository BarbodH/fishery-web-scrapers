414805,Victor,2009-12-23 15:47:00,1609,"Only 9 days left for the year of 2009 and I heard the tribs close to home are frozen, so I probably won't get another fishing trip in before the year ends. Geez I don't even have fish in my fish tank to toy with  This has been a great year for me, although I didn't catch any monsters, but I did learned a ton, caught some new species, bought many new toys, fished with many good friends and met new ones. Unlike MJL, I suck at writing so I'll just cut the crap and get to the pics  2009 started off with a number of early, cold, and unsuccessful trips to the eastern tribs ... I decided to mix things up and try my hand at some channel cats. Here's my first ever channel cat that came in @ 11lbs. Love this shot with the sun setting at the background.   I did keep on pursuing the steelies and I finally landed my first ever steelhead on the opener, also my first real fish on a centrepin.   May - August was my study term in Waterloo so I spent most of my time there. Although I didn't have a car I did manage to get out quite a bit thanks to Marko & Trevor. With them showing me around I caught my first ever Brookie and brown.   They're just beautiful.   I also caught my smallest pumpkinseed ever, coming in at about 3 inches (yes my hand is small lol)   Now, onto the Cyprinus Carpio. My PB was set at 26lbs 5oz 2 years ago and I have been very eager to beat it as 30s aren't that rare especially in hamilton. I couldn't achieve that goal in 09 but I did catch 3 fish that made me VERY happy. I have never caught a mirror carp before and I got 3 this year, with each one growing in size. First, a baby one.   Then, it got alittle bigger at 12lbs.   And finally, a fully scaled 16lber.   Here's the biggest of the year for me, @ 23lbs.   I did catch some bass too lol.   In the fall, I landed my first ever salmon. (mad fun on the centrepin)   I didn't get out quite as much as I'd like to, especially for the salmon + fall crappie/walleye but it was a very productive and memorable year. Those overnighters were certainly unforgettable (intense, and super fun, but not so much when you need to drive home).  To cap it off, I'd like to thank Mike and Randy for being a great fishing buddies as always (giving me rides, advices and catching all my fish), thanks to Marko/Trevor for driving me around and showing me your 'hood', and to everybody who offered me any advices/help. I look forward to meet many more friends, catching more species and setting new PBs in 2010! I wish everybody a Merry Xmas, happy new year, and a fish-ful 2010! Oh and also, thank you to the OFC mods to maintaining this amazing place!  Victor"

414827,Curtis,2009-12-23 18:23:00,83,I rele enjoyed seeing those mirror carp its been a while since i have caught one of them! Never should have sold the carp gear.. at the time though musky fishing seemed like a good trade off...  Do you ice fish?

414844,Victor,2009-12-23 19:31:00,1609,"Thanks everyone!  Unfortunately I was using my carp rod, it did put up a fight but I find that they only go one direction lol!  Didn't catch any out of the Grand, but i'm sure they are there...  haven't really give it a serious try but I probably will this winter"

414947,MJL,2009-12-24 02:44:00,2427,Great recap Vic.  You just seem to have the knack for getting male fish excited...Maybe your small hands might have something to do with it  Hopefully the fishing in 2010 will be just as good...ROAD TRIP!
