It was good to get out with friends just the same. I'm now looking forward to my Daughters first Christmas to which I have not  had this much excitement since I was a small lad. I cant wait to dress up as  Santa  for her on Christmas morning. She is growing so fast its crazy.   I would like to wish all my fellow OFC members a Merry Merry  Christmas. Remember to be safe. Hope the fat guy in Red brings you all that you asked for."
