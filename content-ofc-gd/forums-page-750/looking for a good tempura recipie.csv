414624,misfish,2009-12-22 23:30:00,29133,"I have used the one from Sobeys.It,s accually very good."
414641,tschirk,2009-12-23 00:16:00,261,The trick is to use ice water...as cold as you can get it...pancake or beer batter will work.  It is the extreme temp shift that give the light batter effect.
414708,aniceguy,2009-12-23 02:38:00,1094,ok is there a specific porpotion of it all
414928,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-24 02:31:00,10439,"  The biggest mistake people make, is making the batter too thick. You want it thin, thin enough that it runs off a fork quite quickly and leaves a thin coating on the fork. Once you get it right it is easy to repeat using the fork drip test. If you make the batter too thick you get that terrible doughy stuff that tastes terrible."
414952,MJL,2009-12-24 02:48:00,2427,"Here's a basic fish and chip recipe from master chef, Marco Pierre White involving: beer, yeast and flour    He's also an avid 'pinner too"
414962,Ben_Daniels,2009-12-24 03:34:00,435," I agree...gotta have the batter on ice... thats how they do it in most of the restaurants I've worked in, seems to make a difference.  -Ben Daniels"
414969,aniceguy,2009-12-24 04:01:00,1094,awsome any compete recipies that you care to share
414982,Ben_Daniels,2009-12-24 04:30:00,435," Walk into the closest Asian restaurant and say that your from another restaurant down the street and your out of tempura batter...usually they give it to you for free lol. I've had to do this for work a couple times. Mix the powdered batter with water, 50/50 mix, and chill it and your off to the races!  -Ben"
415038,canadadude,2009-12-24 13:07:00,769,Google tempura batter you'll get 1000's of recipie's I bet..........the ice water and cold is the secret  I just googled  tempura batter and like I said you could spend a day sorting through recipies hahahaha
415039,solopaddler,2009-12-24 13:16:00,8605,"I've put ice cubes right in the batter to chill it. Like Dave said, not too thick either. Fillets should be cold or at least cool as well. They'll absorb very little grease this way. As far as recipes go I've used the off the shelf Mcormicks tempura batter (I think that's what it was) and it was fine. Doesn't Gerrit have a batter recipe that everyone likes?"
415115,misfish,2009-12-24 18:12:00,29133,  OH YA.
415157,aplumma,2009-12-24 20:14:00,6896,You can also make it with ice cold carbonated water with ice cubes to keep it cold it makes it light as a feather ( thanks food network for the tip).   Art
