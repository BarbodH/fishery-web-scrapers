Just wondering where the best access points are around keswick?  I've never fished cooks bay, I'm usually out north of thorah for the lakers, but my brother is up over the holidays and would like to get out for a fish so any advice would be appreciated.  I hear the perch are what most people are after out there?"

However there is still open water further out of the bay, I'd recommend a floater suit just in case. Yep most people target perch there, but pike can be caught as well. Good luck!"
