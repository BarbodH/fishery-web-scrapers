414704,Fisherman,2009-12-23 02:28:00,7201,"they are too, but got to remember, while fishing from the dock, you're not ""ice fishing"", you're a land lubber and can only use one rod."

414795,dickie,2009-12-23 14:49:00,64,Where was it that you measured 8 inches of ice? Was it an outfitter that was pulling the huts out so he would be ready for the opener?
414869,Mike01,2009-12-23 22:04:00,378,"I measured 8"" yesterday at the mouth of Kervin bay.  The hut I saw going across was for personal use, but the outfitters are strating to bring out their huts too."
