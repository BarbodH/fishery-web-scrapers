I of course laugh out loud and say “no, but you’re gonna love my nuts!” as I hold up a bag from the bulk barn.  She wasn’t impressed but I sure was…  HAHA"

And then the cashier says.. ""I'm sorry Mam.. but your Mastercard has been declined, do you have another card"" !  Gave me a chuckle at the time, but sad all the same. Christmas has got out of hand.. and you can't spend what you don't have folks!"
