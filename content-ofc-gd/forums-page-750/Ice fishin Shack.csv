414289,Fishnwire,2009-12-21 23:11:00,983,"One thing to keep in mind, which at least half of all builders of huts I've been in did not, is to place your windows low enough so that you can look at your outside lines while sitting down.  Having to stand up every two minutes to see if your flag is up is a pain...you should be able to sit there in front of your inside hole, jigging away and just tilt your head up and get a perfect view of your outside tip-up or whatever."
