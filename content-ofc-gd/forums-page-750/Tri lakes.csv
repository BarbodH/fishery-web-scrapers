414944,pike slayer,2009-12-24 02:41:00,1177,arent sturgeon illegal to target? also the ice should be quite safe everywhere by mid jan.
414950,cowanjo,2009-12-24 02:47:00,249,I dont want to catch or target them - i was told they were in this lake - i cannot believe this is correct and if they were  it would be an independant strain worth saving
414954,jediangler,2009-12-24 02:57:00,1923,I heard that from a disreputable truck driver 3 yrs ago as well. I just chocked it up to Bull from a guy who has been on the road all day with no one to talk to jumping in on the conversation. Said he knew a guy (don't we all) that caught one north of Big Island in Pigeon lake.
