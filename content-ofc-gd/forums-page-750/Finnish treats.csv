414922,bigugli,2009-12-24 02:18:00,6138,"Got to have 'pulla' as part of the table dressings. Goes along with the cardamom cookies, gingersnaps and shortbreads and washed down with a nice glass of Lingonberry punch or Peter Heering.     Hyyva Joulua"
414960,SBCregal,2009-12-24 03:25:00,688,"I love that stuff, I think theres some in the freezer still.  I did some baking the other day as well, tried my hand at making Luumutortut...the prune tarts.  They turned out pretty decent for my first attempt  here's a pic of what's left of the 4 dozen we made     ryan"
414961,bigugli,2009-12-24 03:31:00,6138, You did quite well with those.  My Gram always cheated and filled them with raspberry or blueberry preserves.
414966,SBCregal,2009-12-24 03:37:00,688,"They passed the test with my mom... not quite like Grandma's, but in reality...nothing will be the same as hers were"
414967,bigugli,2009-12-24 03:42:00,6138,"Ain't that the truth! Nothing like the heavenly aroma of Grandmother's baking. The mix of cardamom, nutmeg and cinnamon that would fill the air in our small home."
415008,Twocoda,2009-12-24 06:22:00,4130,you guys would make me a great wife...strictly platonic of course...well depends on how ya look in an apron
415143,Dara,2009-12-24 19:39:00,3052,"  ummm..No, it doesn't"
415152,aplumma,2009-12-24 20:07:00,6896,If you want to make pastries just like Grandma made use lots and lots of lard. It is the secret ingredient that the doctors have convinced us is killing us. (yaa I know it is bad but it still is the best)  Art
415154,SBCregal,2009-12-24 20:12:00,688,one thing i've learned since i made them... where the recipe calls for water...use whipping cream  im liking the way grandma thought!
415181,Fisherman,2009-12-24 21:01:00,7201," Peter Heering...I haven't heard that for a looong time, have to look and see if they have it here."

415277,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-25 03:36:00,2582,  Fine looking spread there Bruce! All calorie wise low fat stuff I see  Why do so many of your posts make me hungry  Happy holidays to all of your clan.
415279,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-25 03:48:00,0,i had some pulla tonight as well...along with my finnish grandmothers infamous rice pudding.  hyvaa joulua!
415282,vinnimon,2009-12-25 04:10:00,2593,i want dibs on those  eggs
415285,bigugli,2009-12-25 04:18:00,6138, Was the riisipuuri smothered in blueberry sauce?
415295,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-25 05:09:00,0,"  not this time.  at christmas she makes the sauce out of prunes and raisins. but in summer it's blueberry for sure. she's very aggressive with her pudding, you better try it, or she gets real offended!  troutologist has sampled her pulla on many a fishing trip morning!  ""sit in stomach like rock"""
415320,Fisherman,2009-12-25 18:46:00,7201,"Have you two ever had Pulla with vanilla sauce, my mom used to make a yeast cake something like that, but with vanila sauce made from real vanilla beans."
415331,bigugli,2009-12-25 20:06:00,6138,"I've never heard of vanilla sauce, but I'm sure it is scrumptious.  The recipe for pulla is standard to all the scandi and germanic cultures. Only differences are in the spices, shapes and toppings. Pulla, Swedish tea ring, English chelsea bun and Bohemian braid start with the same basic dough."
415345,SBCregal,2009-12-25 20:49:00,688,mmmmmmmm  just talked to mom on the phone and shes making up some Rosolli to have with dinner
