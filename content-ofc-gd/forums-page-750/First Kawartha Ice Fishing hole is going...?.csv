414721,Michael_Brown,2009-12-23 03:12:00,411,"Chemong Lake.  I have waited a long time for this. To punch a hole in a Kawartha lake (besides Scugog) and haul up some tasty panfish. Myself and several close friends will be fishing on the south side of the causeway on Chemong Lake on Jan. 1, 2010. The famous Ron Reyns might join us for a panfish beating and possibly the Elvis of Ontario ice fishing Matty Garvin might make an appearance.   Give us a honk on the way by or better yet grab your gear and join in. Lot's of room. (large coffee with two milk)  Frank at Bridgenorth Sport and Marine has assured me he will be awake and open at 6 am on Jan. 1, 2010 with lots of fresh minnows to donate to the local panfish herd.   Have a great holiday season.  Mike BWPF_OOD_Ad.pdf"

414778,GBW,2009-12-23 13:39:00,8460,"either ""the bog"" or four mile for me..."
414792,Jer,2009-12-23 14:37:00,1426,"We'll either be walking out from my house on Buckhorn, or from Mars Marina on Chemong. I hope the ice conditions are conducive for walking, I still need to get my hands on a toboggan of some sort for hauling our stuff."
414801,GBW,2009-12-23 15:28:00,8460,"$8.00 at CTC for a basic one, I just looked for one too..."
414836,Tom McCutcheon,2009-12-23 19:18:00,627,"Jer, I have a childs wooden sleigh with the back rests on it, it is what I used when I was younger and more energetic. It will carry a five gallon pail ( for bait and  for tackle and perch/crappie) along with a small backpack etc. I put stainless steel runners on the bottom of the skis and it pulls quite easily. You are more than welcome to it if you want it. Just collecting dust anymore in my garage. I am just around the corner from you. PM me.  Tom."
414850,Jer,2009-12-23 19:52:00,1426,"Hi Tom, I just might take you up on that. I'm gonna go look what Canadian Tire has and maybe what Frank at Bridgenorth Sports has as well. I need something big enough to haul my tackle, my pop-up hut, auger, folding chair, beverages...geez the list keeps getting longer and the load bigger the more I think of it."
414901,Tom McCutcheon,2009-12-24 00:36:00,627,"I hear ya Jer. That's why I now just hook up the four wheeler to the fish trap...... No problem, the sleigh is available to you or whoever else would like it. Tom."
