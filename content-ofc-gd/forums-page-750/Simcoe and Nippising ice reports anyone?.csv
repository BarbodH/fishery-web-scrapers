413921,tapout,2009-12-20 18:40:00,166,"Hey everyone,  Been awhile since I've been on the board but am getting the itch to get out.  Was wondering about the ice thickness or existence of any at all particularly Cook's Bay and Virginia Beach on Simcoe and the conditions on Nippising particularly South Bay area.  Cheers and look forward to fishing with some of you again this year.  Tony."
413924,Terry,2009-12-20 18:43:00,14456,"on simcoe by virginina beach there is ice but Sly's WILCRAFT  is the only thing that's been on the ice, any day now I would think there will be guys on the ice"
413925,misfish,2009-12-20 18:47:00,29133,"Hey Tony,good to hear from ya.  Be safe out there.Like Terry said,anytime now."
414026,sandybay,2009-12-20 23:58:00,64,I was out on South Bay of Lake Nipissing yesterday and the pack ice along shore measured 7-9 inches and the black ice measured 6 1/2 inches at 3 different places. Hope this helps and Merry Christmas.  Jeff
414030,Bernie,2009-12-21 00:16:00,3190,Jeff. Were you in Hunters Bay?
414034,sandybay,2009-12-21 00:23:00,64,No I was from my place and headed northwest and back. But from what I have heard and seen hunters bay should have about 8 inches. But don't quote me on that lol
414036,Rizzo,2009-12-21 00:29:00,4754,no ice on kempenfelt bay as far as I could see from 7th line of oro
