I was just out at Fishing World in Hamilton and Wow is all I can say.  They have a huge selection of Winter Gear. Ice fishing stuff wont last long at the prices they have. Some hard to get Sold out elsewhere stuff as well. Very large selection of 2010 bait from all manufactuers.  Supporting our local stores keeps our prices down. Great service also, which is what matters."
