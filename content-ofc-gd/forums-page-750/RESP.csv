414593,TJQ,2009-12-22 22:18:00,7806,"Just a note, the final tally for the RESP's was $3,248.00    This will grow by 5-7% per year till they go to school.  The Government matches up to 20% of this, and the kids also get bonus payments from the pool of interest that doesn't get used by other kids.  It will be substantial in 12 years or so when they need it!  The paperwork has been submitted and will be processed in the new year.  Thanks to all who helped me out with this.  OFC RULES!!!!  I cant get the FONT any Bigger!!!"

414782,Gman,2009-12-23 13:57:00,126, To maximum of $500/yr per child.  Been saving money for both children since they year before they were born and haven't stopped.  We believe it's part of planned parenthood.  Little bit every month over a long period is much more painless than larger sums over a shorter period plus you get the benefits of dollar cost averaging and compounded growth - the 8th wonder of the world!  Congrats TJ!  Cheers G.
