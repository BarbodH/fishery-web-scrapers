368417,cranks bait,2009-07-31 14:04:00,721,I leave my boat in a lift sling from ice out to ice in.  I only cover in the winter months.  I do have a metal roof that is shared with boats on either side so I do not worry too much about rain.  I do cover my seats every night though just to keep bugs and bird doo doo off.
368460,cpguy29,2009-07-31 16:00:00,148,2 ties to the dock and no cover. Had a cover the first year and every time I came up it had blown off and water had gotten in anyway. No problems with theft either in 6 years.
