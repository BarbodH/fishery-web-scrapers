There will be a slit in the bottom stem to put your line through, then release the spring and it will wrap around your line to lock it into the slit in the bottom of the float."
368688,eze76,2009-08-01 11:21:00,70,"Ive tried that, i mean ive put the spring up and put the line through , but thats it  should i be wrapping it around where the slit is then putting the spring down"
368689,tightline,2009-08-01 11:43:00,322,I'm guessing theres a slit under the spring for your line to go in...you can just put it through once that way its a quick adjustment or if you wrap it once will keep it locked in place
368692,eze76,2009-08-01 11:55:00,70,Alrighty
368696,tjsa,2009-08-01 12:34:00,1578," Nope, just pass the line through the slit and let the spring go over the line, that's it, that's all"
