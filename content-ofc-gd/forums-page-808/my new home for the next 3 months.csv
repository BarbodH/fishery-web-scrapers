368186,jasonl,2009-07-30 23:30:00,29,well like many others my job ended last week and there definately doesn't seem like ther is much going on in niagara so i started looking abroad. Well I got a pretty decent offer in baker lake nunavut and i'll be leaving next week  http://static.flickr.com/32/63724664_a9b91904be.jpg   after 3 months I'll get some time off and a ticket back home so i'll atleast be able to chase some salmon and hopefully get a deer in the freezer

368218,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-31 00:59:00,10439,"I hope you're making a crap load of money because you will be paying 10 to 15 dollars for a gallon of milk or 2 liter of pop in Baker Lake!!!!! A friend of mine lived there for a while and clued me in on the living expenses there. Bring lots of Pixie spoons as the Char and Laker fishing is pretty decent in the area. It should be a blast though, have fun and post pics!!!!"

Cant beat that, luved it, as we survived 130Km plus winds.  great experiences.  try to get your self on some Caribou Hunts, my favorite meat."
