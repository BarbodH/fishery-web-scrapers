368080,MSBruno,2009-07-30 18:56:00,369,Looking at the option to leave a 15' bass boat at a marina for the season for convenience.  Sparrow Lake looks good which allows me to meet up with friends and allows passageway to other bodies of water.  Any idea on pricing?  I've called around a received pricing in the neighbourhood of $350/season .. does this sound right?  Anyone reccomend a marina at Sparrow or in and around muskoka?

368097,MSBruno,2009-07-30 19:32:00,369, I'm comming from Vaughan amd can make it to 2 sparrow lake marina's in 1hr30min.  Balsam is more than 30 more min away for me.

368179,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-30 23:10:00,947,if you trailer there's places around Orillia you can leave your boat and trailer at.  Plus it's not a far drive to any lake you choose
