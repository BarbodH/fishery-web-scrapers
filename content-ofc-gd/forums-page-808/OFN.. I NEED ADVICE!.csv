Some advice... - ensure your transit/moving is paid for both ways.  If for whatever reason your stay is cut short (change in economy, immigration rules, whatever), they have to pay to get you back - try to structure a flight (or a couple of them) home every year or so. - look into the tax situation.  It may be tax free there, but you are likely still on the hook here."

Gees I should of tryed.  When I was in Germany we lived on the Economy, meaning we rented from the Germans vice staying on base.  We learned German within a year, while some of my peers had no clue after three years.  Best thing about it, we made some great friends who were German and we had great experience through them.  Unfortunately (or Fortunately) I got promoted and returned to Chilliwack after one year.  But it is an experience that my family would of never known if we hadn't tried.  Another great thing is my Daughter was born there, I guess shes part German."

368351,Chris,2009-07-31 11:20:00,405,"Just from the posts so far, it appears that most of the people who have 1st hand or 2nd hand experience living down there have given you a fair warning and have said to look very seriously at the situation before making a decision, offering their own experiences to back up what they're saying. I'm not trying to sound condescending but, most of the people who are saying ""go for it"" seem to have little or no experience living there and have offered no info on living there. I think that should tell you something.  Also, are you the type that seeks world-wide life experiences? Or more of a home-body? Not everyone relishes in world travel and not everyone looks at life as a journey that must be fulfilled to acheive happiness. Not everyone has the need to experience the cultures of others. Only you can make that decision for yourself.  Good luck in whatever you do BBR"
368379,bigbuck,2009-07-31 12:40:00,2449,"The tax situation is a really important factor to look into. I grew up in the grocery business and have done just about everything there is to do in a grocery store from pushing buggies to being a butcher. Check everything out thoroughly before you make a decision. Get as much information as possible. If you know how to bone meat, I know someone who is always looking for 'boners' (don't laugh, these are th guys that make all the profit for a meat business) in Toronto if you are looking for a change and he pays well and takes care of his people."

368383,JohnF,2009-07-31 12:48:00,3494,"Well Rich, you've had the whole spectrum of responses. Probably not too helpful to you all in all.  Back in the day I was always up for any experience like that but with the benefit of hindsight consider these facts (or suggestions): 1. Bermuda is a very small isolated island so once you've seen all 20 square miles of it the new is over. You don't don't just hop on a quaint little train and ride down the line to go skiing in Zermat or Klosters or Innsbruck for a day or two. Side trips are the best part of spending time in a distant port. 2. I have been assured by folks who live and have lived there that it's a very expensive place to live. Food basics have to be brought in by container when the weather allows off-loading. We were without bread and milk for over 4 days on Grand Cayman one visit there. It's bigger than Bermuda and still has no production industries to speak, I understand there's a local bakery but it also dependent on off shore materials, and there are certainly a couple of brewhouses but no herds of cattle or goats for milk. Reason says Bermuda will be much the same. 3. I get the sense that the weather isn't necessarily tropical, the kind you'd get in, say, Grand Cayman or Tobago. Not to say it isn't nice, but remember, the nearest port offering major medical services is Boston. Look at a globe. 4. Check out the fishing offered. These islands are essentially mountains in the sea. Don't be surprised if the fishing involves boats going out to sea and that means expense. It also means giving up the kind of fishing you know and do best, probably better than most folks on this board. The Bass Hound wouldn't cut it if you know what I mean. 5. Ask about any contract required before you agree to go. I can't remember the details from my own investigation, but it seems to me there was a minimum and maximum stay required for foreigners to get employment. They don't want folks coming there on a lark expecting to ditch the job if things don't go smoothly. It's a smart way of protecting the island society from an influx of rowdy fly by night types I suppose. 6. Finally, by all means talk to some folks who have actually lived there and get their impressions of the lifestyle. I was talked out of it by the same person who put me onto the opportunity in the first place. She and her husband now live and work in Canada and are quite happy to be here.  And if you consider all those things, and talk to folks with experience, and decide to go, then you'll be doing it well-informed, and there's less likelihood of disappointment.  So, all that being said, it might just be your adventure of a lifetime. All the best with it.  JF"
368390,holdfast,2009-07-31 12:58:00,1813," What you say about Jamaica is true as I have a Buddie that has Laisoned Military training there for the Jamaicans and he says its an extremely Dangerous country with lots of murders.  However, can you say the same for Burmuda/Bahamas  Like I said do your Homework.  Too Bad that you cant go, say, a week ,with a sponser to make the decision.  If your on a tedder todder, may be you can demand a house, hunting trip prior, or tell them its a No GO.  Its your life."
368429,Rattletrap2,2009-07-31 14:54:00,1652,"Rich, I've been reading all the good advice you have been getting. I know it does not make it any easier to decide!  I can't say the opportunity was ever offered to me before personally, but I know a few people who have worked in Bahamas and St. Lucia. They all felt the same about it. Nice to visit, but it gets old real quick! They were all only there for 3 months at a time as well, not three years!  3 years is a huge commitment.  Good luck, but think it over real well before deciding. JF has some solid advice for you."
368435,doubleheader,2009-07-31 15:07:00,497,"I couldn't agree more to John F's post. I did a 3 year stint in Budapest Hungary in the 90's, so even though I'm not a Canadian citizen I think I can add some advice. After you check things out, if you think you might be interested go back to your boss and negotiate. My salary was doubled when I went to Budapest, and while my situation was somewhat different it was common for me to offer salary adjustments of up to 50% for employees that I brought over from the States. Don't be afraid to discuss a ""stay"" bonus, which is money they would pay you at the completion of the tour. Make sure your job back in Canada is guaranteed upon your return. As far as medical care is concerned we had insurance that included a chartered jet back to the US within 24 hrs. in the event any of our US employees had a medical emergency.  Housing- negotiate, ours was paid. Travel back to Canada- I had two trips /year paid. Vacation- negotiate.  In the end, if you get a deal that sounds good to you get everything in writing and take it to your attorney for review. Be adventurous but be smart too. If they want you they will negotiate and if not you're better off knowing up front before you turn your life upside down. You have a skill they need, don't sell yourself short."

I actually looked into moving there to work a few years back and didn't get too far thru the process before I decided it wasn't what we really wanted. Three years is a long time to commit to without knowing what's in store. And remember any family is still gonna be back here, and it's an air evac to Boston for serious medical  treatment, etc.  I'm all for great adventures, probably too much so in my younger years, but I'm betting that once you do some investigation you'll start to think that Bermuda may not be for you.

I have lived the expat life for 10 years and don't regret a thing.  Remember everywhere in the world gets more time off than in North America so you can come home for vacation.  That is what I used to do.  What started off for me as a 6 month stay in Abu Dhabi/Dubai ended up lasting 8 years.

I was offered a position there and turned it down for this reason and the fact that Ontario rocks and dispite being taxed to death I still like it here more. There is a reason they have trouble attracting skilled workers. Still very much a colonial system with the wealth in the hands of very few.

368266,Fishnwire,2009-07-31 02:28:00,983,"Taxes are high in Ontario...but you get what you pay for.  Roads, schools, hospitals, law enforcement, parks and rec, etc...someone has to pay for that stuff and we all enjoy the benefits of living in the greatest place on earth.  Sure taxes could be lowered.  We could also live in a country where the children of low-income families have no option other than starving to death, or dying of the flu."
368272,CLofchik,2009-07-31 02:31:00,854,"I've been, and Bermuda is the last island I'd want to be stuck on for three years.  You can live pretty cheap if you ""go local"", but it does get old & repetitive fast.  There's a reason the grumpiest, most bitter guys you find in a bar down there are long term ex-pats.  And the shore fishing isn't that great."
368273,Dutch,2009-07-31 02:32:00,831,"In Canada you are taxed on your World-wide income, unless you become non-resident.  It is very hard to become non-resident, it is not a simple fact of changing your address.  You basically have to cut most ties to the country, if not all.  Bank accounts, drivers license, any property you may own yourself or jointly, spouses or common-law partners, dependants - the list goes on.  Here is a link:  http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/nnrsdnts/cmmn/rsdncy-eng.html  As you can see, there are very many factors to consider.  Honestly, it is very hard to prove you are non-resident.  If you are resident, you are taxed on your world-wide income and must file a Canadian income tax return.  They may not deduct income taxes at source, like they do in Canada, hence they advertise it as a ""tax-free"" salary, but that doesn't mean you will not have to pay taxes - you still have to file a Canadian income tax return if you are a resident."

Life my friend is ALLL about the journey .... and those who are the envy of the rest later on in life are the ones who took the chance and went on that journey ....  Happy to hook you up for information exchange ... remember, opportunities like this dont come up every day .. especially when your other responsibilities and obligations dont have to take priority"
