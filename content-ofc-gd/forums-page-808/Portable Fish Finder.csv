368990,PickerelHunter,2009-08-02 19:41:00,100,"I don't have a fish finder myself, nor a boat, however when fishing a lake for the first time I like to have one to check depths etc and the rental doesn't usually have one.  When I lived in St. Catharines I had a guy that would lend me his once in awhile but since moving to Barrie last year doesn't make sense to drive down there just for that.  Does anyone have a portable fish finder they could lend me for a small fee?  Thanks Peter"
