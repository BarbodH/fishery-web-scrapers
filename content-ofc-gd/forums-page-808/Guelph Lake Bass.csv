368862,evster,2009-08-02 01:55:00,367,"I have been meaning to get out onto Guelph Lake for some time now.  I have fished it for shore before and caught a couple little fish.  I finally had a half day to fish somewhere close to home so decided to get out on Guelph Lake since the winds were nice.  I found it to be a pretty big lake for only allowing electric trolling motors, I worked my way all the way down one shore and ended up taking about 40 minutes to get back to the launch since the wind had picked up.  We lost a couple nice fish but managed to boat 3 bass, all of which weighed in right on 3 pounds.      "

368871,jediangler,2009-08-02 02:38:00,1923,Nice bass evster. Guelph lake is a real gem as far as conservation area lakes go. There are some real nice pike and crappie in there as well.

368883,Burning Babies,2009-08-02 03:36:00,150,"Gorgeous color on those fish, man.  I wish the bass we catch down hear looked like the ones you guys have.  My PB smallmouth came from Wisconsin and had a similar coloration to that one.  I really wish I had a pic of that fish."
