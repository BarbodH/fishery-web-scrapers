368540,tightline,2009-07-31 18:57:00,322,I'm pretty sure they would have taken one look at the soaked shoes wet shorts and water all over my shirt...not too mention the word of 2 guys who have been fishing for 25 years without ever a fine and gave us the benefit of the doubt...was a lucky catch and a great 10 mins...the fish is still in there for the next guy all I took was the pics
368543,tipupesox,2009-07-31 19:07:00,167,Great catch.  Don't let the militant attitude of some muskie fisherman bring you down.  Nothing wrong with teaching people the appropiate way to handle and release a ski but why the need for the harrassment.
368578,musky66,2009-07-31 20:47:00,273,"Wow, pretty harsh stuff. Nice catch, and even better from the Moon to boot- took me three years of off and on camping on Blackstone to get 2 in the boat one trip. Both fish were sub legals- 39"" and 48""- I damn well took the time for photo's and a healthy release and would do so again. Would love the chance of playing, and releasing a sweet fish from shore like you did. Good going!"
368607,Jigger,2009-07-31 22:30:00,1237,"If the CO would've shown up and saw a guy end up on a shoal and get out, fight the musky, take a few pics and then return the 'ski in good condition, he would have absolutely nothing but ""Good job"" to say.  Congrats on the PB tightline. Sounds like you guys had a great time!"
368608,fisherman7,2009-07-31 22:42:00,325,"Oh god, I hope this does not become another Fishing Message Board where everyone jumps on some poor dude. But it's sure looking that way.  Buddy, great fish and you should be very happy with a PB."
368611,danbouck,2009-07-31 22:58:00,4380,Some of you need to go fishing and relax.  Nice fish!!!
368645,Governator,2009-08-01 01:23:00,879,  Agreed.  Nice fish!
368652,Greencoachdog,2009-08-01 02:02:00,8163,Nice fish Dude!!!  Don't let the Muskie-tards rev you up too much  If you want to get even with them... just casually mention how you foul hooked it in the anal vent with a 7/0 treble!
368653,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-01 02:07:00,0,Musky tard......  Anal hooking.....now thats some foul hooking for sure...
368655,Greencoachdog,2009-08-01 02:12:00,8163,  Yup!... and I farted in your general direction too!!!
368657,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-01 02:26:00,0,is there someone else up there we can talk too?............ Now don't launch a cow ....
368661,ctdd2006,2009-08-01 02:44:00,531,Way to go!  Congrats on the catch and release.  Cheers.
368666,Greencoachdog,2009-08-01 03:22:00,8163,  I'm fixin' to drop the MOAB after reading this thread!.... hope I make it to the outhouse in time!!!  MOAB
368680,Cudz,2009-08-01 06:27:00,2652,nice fish.  Believeable story.
368682,singingdog,2009-08-01 09:55:00,1047,"Great fish, great story, you didn't do anything wrong."
368686,bdox,2009-08-01 11:03:00,329,You musky elitists need to take a chill pill
368700,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-01 12:49:00,0,elitists.....  Im not part of any group...there's to many other fish to fry to get stuck on just one. I'd say some people have to learn how to fish and do it right. There's way more to the Bull story than buddy is willing to admit.  .but hey...Thats just my thought...........    Hey GCD..  ...I hope that MOAB didnt hurt to much and that you made it to the outhouse to let er rip!
368705,Terry,2009-08-01 13:05:00,14456,"I still wonder  as they say a picture say a thousand words to me it looks like the rod and net is on the far side of the boat and the rods are set nicely away not on the shore side  if you ran up on a shoal and stepped out in shallow water how did the prop survive being down everyone I know puts the motor up as soon as they get close to shoals and seeing it was shallow enough to step out and fight a fsh the motor should be up and the boat is along the shore not nosed into a shoal... but  that is just what the  picture suggest, the truth..well who knows.... the guys complaining were just going by what they saw......right or wrong they were trying to protect the fish they love"
368714,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-01 13:26:00,0,Your not saying that there wasn't enough room in the boat to take a picture...so they went to shore for one. ...WOW...What a revelation.....
368715,tightline,2009-08-01 13:42:00,322,If you have ever been to woods bay or blackstone harbour you would know that trolling the shoreline can be pretty dangerous...I hooked the fish trolling about 30 feet behind the boat...I yelled at my buddy to throw it in neutral before you know it the motor was bouncing the fish was fighting he was panicking...I fought the fish for about a minute longer we were banging on the rocks so he took my pole I stepped out of the boat gave me the pole he got out we landed the fish I took pics enough is enough....why are you so adament about this is your world really this small????????
368720,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-01 13:58:00,0,lol ....................the insults won't help with how it went. I guess reading won't help either.  The storys keep flowing. I also think that maybe...jusy maybe...you might learn how to do it right the next time instead of dragging fish around so you can get a good picture. Just so you can get yer ego stroked on a fishing site. I know the Bay very well. Ive only fished it for 35 years. and ...I wasnt born yeterday.....
368724,tightline,2009-08-01 14:12:00,322,The story has never changed just wasn't aware you needed a play by play...pretty sure your the only one looking to get your ego stroked or you wouldn't be monitoring this post so close...if this is such a concern to you the number is 1-888-MNR-TIPS and I would gladly tell them the story and have it confirmed by people who were actually there...if you've benn fishing there for 35 years you would know what I said about the shoreline is true and I was actually warned by people on this site of the dangers...we hit rocks 4 times that weekend trolling....anyway have a great day I'm off to snag another one drag it around the lake till it floats gut it then throw it back in just for the hell of it!!!!
368725,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-01 14:28:00,0,Its funny how you seem to miss my point. I wouldnt expect that you would fish any other way. Enjoy your day out on the water. Just a tip for ya.   If you are not nudging rocks on the bay. You arent fishing!....lol.... and I've said that before many times.
368726,tightline,2009-08-01 14:37:00,322,I got your point and respect it...it just doesn't apply to this case like you insist it does...
368729,Spiel,2009-08-01 14:55:00,9065,"I think we've just about exhausted this one (the post). Nice fish, kudos for releasing it."
368358,tightline,2009-07-31 11:33:00,322,LOL maybe not I did however get them in thw photo gallery somehow so if you'd like to check them out its under Moon River Update by tightline!!!
368361,Terry,2009-07-31 11:45:00,14456,
368377,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-31 12:35:00,0,Nice deal. Was it caught from Shore by chance?
368407,tightline,2009-07-31 13:42:00,322,No it was actually caught trolling off a point going from 4 feet to 10 and the end....My PB thanks for posting it here still can't figure it out?
368431,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-31 15:02:00,0,"  It's not a good thing to retain a fish that has a minimum length of 54"". Nice to see ya got a PB and a picture is ok.......but at least learn the fishing regulations regarding each species."
368443,PikeMolester,2009-07-31 15:25:00,428,sick color. congrats
368451,tightline,2009-07-31 15:43:00,322,what does that mean???  retain a fish???  I released this fish after the pics were taken....would never keep a musky...what gave you the idea I kept it
368452,mistaredone,2009-07-31 15:45:00,913,I think it's the shore pic that would make one think that
368454,mistaredone,2009-07-31 15:47:00,913,Congrats on the pb musky.
368455,Raf,2009-07-31 15:50:00,3495," since, after catching that fish trolling, you proceeded to go to shore for the photo opp you were breaking the law by being in possession (retaining) of a sub 54"" muskie.  keep the camera on the boat!"
368457,tightline,2009-07-31 15:56:00,322,I hooked the fish in the boat but the water went shallow so I stepped out...landed the fish on shore...hooked in the boat....took a pic released it...You guys sure know how to crush what was a high for me Thanks All!!!
368465,Leecher,2009-07-31 16:08:00,7832,Congrats on your PB!!! a real beauty Leechman
368469,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-31 16:16:00,0, Sorry that you can't take helpful criticism. It is what it is and trying to explain it anyway else just make s it worse. Next time I'm sure you'll do it the right way and take a camera along with you.   Funny though. Nice spot you were fishing. A channel and the fish caught right in front of your camp site.
368475,tightline,2009-07-31 16:28:00,322,That fish was not caught in front of my site I was camped on Captain Allen Strait...and the fish was caught on our way back to the docks on our way out....as you can see the boat is packed in the pic...that was the icing on the cake...could see the docs from where I caught it...wasn't fishing for Musky was fishing for walleye as I caught it on a #8 Shadrap (clearly not a Musky lure)...it just happened and was what it was as you can see in the other photos in the album posted in the gallery the camera was allways on the boat...thanks for all your words of wisdom I feel enlightened!!
368480,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-31 16:36:00,0,...they arent my words of wisdom .  ....It's written in a little book called 'fishing regulations'  ....do what you feel is right then!....
368494,tightline,2009-07-31 17:10:00,322,THE FISH WAS NEVER TRANSPORTED IN THE BOAT!!!!! You assumed that and you know what they say about assumptions...I get you were only trying to be informative but you should collect the facts before asserting your 2 cents!!!
368495,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-31 17:11:00,0,"CAP'N ALLAN! told ya!!  dont stress it, some guys here luv their 'skies!!! good lookin fish...   ya think wrong.....lol. I fish for them all and by the way, I do it right...."
368496,Pondo,2009-07-31 17:13:00,36," So, was it dragged to shore or on a stringer???"
368498,tightline,2009-07-31 17:17:00,322,I hooked the fish while trolling 10 feet off shore the boat ran into a shoal when I was fighting it...as my friend is not so boat savy I stepped out of the boat continued to fight it and landed it acctually standing in the water...I took 3 pics and released the fish...never knew it was going to be a holy war on the website or would have never bothered posting it
368501,addy79,2009-07-31 17:24:00,573, hahaha best of both worlds!! LOL
368520,fishinggeek,2009-07-31 18:14:00,325," I agree, people can jump to conclusions and be quite political, especially over their muskies.  That story sounds believable and legal to me.  Congrats on the catch!  I'm sure if someone posted a picture of a stringer of 60 perch where 50 perch were the limit, it wouldn't have gotten such a response from some people."
368527,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-31 18:24:00,0,"lol ....ya try and help out a wee bit..... You would have paid for what you interpret as legal with a fine. Never once did I say the picture or catch was a bad thing and yes I'd say something if you had a pail 'o' Perch that was over yer limit.,,,,,"
368531,Terry,2009-07-31 18:38:00,14456,"your story sounds believable and I can see someone doing that but I have to say I think if the MNR saw you on shore with a muskie and your boat, they would charge you no matter what you said......  it is something to think about"
368536,tightline,2009-07-31 18:47:00,322,Not sure which part of the catch your not comprehending but although I did hook the fish in the boat I landed it from shore as I was only 10 feet off it when I caught it and was in less then 4 feet of water...I'm pretty sure your the same gbfisher from the fish ontario website that got shut down because of crap like this...do me a favour and find a better way to spend your time then causing crap on what was one of my best days on the water...I have a friend who will atest to the catch if wish to take matters further... I'm sure the ministry would take the word of 2 people who were there then sombody assuming he knows all possible catch situations and has figured out the probablity of the situation and has come to the conclusion that this could not be possible...funny really I have read a bunch of your posts and you seem to get off on this kind of thing
368537,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-31 18:50:00,0,Ya think?  I think that you would have been fined. End of story! Sorry about being banned on Fish Ontario.
