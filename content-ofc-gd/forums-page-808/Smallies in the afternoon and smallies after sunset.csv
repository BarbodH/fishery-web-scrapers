368678,Cudz,2009-08-01 06:11:00,2652,"It was such a beautiful day that my family and I decided to go out on the boat (we went out yeasteday as well).  Between playing on the tube, swimming and actually riding the tube, I managed to get some fishing in.  Caught 2 smalljaws this afternoon and a bunch of perch.  Decent fish.  This evening I decided to go fishing from shore.  After droping my flashlight and shattering it on some big rocks I had to depend on my cell phone for light for the rest of the evening.  Luckily we had a bright low moon tonight.  I hit up 4 spots tonight and went 5 for 9.  I also had some decent blowups that completely missed the lure.  I managed to take a pic of my best evening fish.  Probably went 3+.  Nice fish.  I love this night fishing.  Very exciting and intense.  Fish from this aft   Fish from this evening.  I looked a bit stunned in this pic.  It is totally dark.  I also managed to cut off the fish's tail in the pic.  Guess I should look at the pic before I let the fish go. "
