NO need to post your secret spot because i'm sure I already know where it is, and I have afew of my own that I never see anyone fishing."
368767,douG,2009-08-01 20:31:00,2693,"Congratulations on the new family, CoolB.  It seems to suit you well.  Your daughter looks as though she shares her Ma's good looks.   A cutie fer sure."
367671,CoolB,2009-07-29 17:43:00,47,"It took a few years but my father and I have finally figured out a a strategy for the Grand River. Last last few years we have been catching limits or close to each time we head out. We went out again yesterday sticking to the same method as always and got rewarded with some mighty fine fish. I'm not going to give away my method or spots but I will say this, 1 lure (different color patterns) and trolling the same spots within a 10 minute boat ride of the launch.   "

367927,CoolB,2009-07-30 03:52:00,47, I still talk to kronik all the time. He's gone through a lot of changes in his life recently and is very busy with work. He hasn't had much time for fishing the last few years.
367929,tambo,2009-07-30 03:56:00,85,"great work, love finding a pattern"

368014,kemper,2009-07-30 15:08:00,2232,CoolB...There is a name I havent seen around in a long time  Nice fish dude
368015,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-30 15:14:00,1022,Nice eyes. If you can consistently catch pickerel on the Grand you should become a guide.
