369108,Nippissinger,2009-08-03 10:00:00,53,"Nice report, thanx Steve...There have also been reports that the eyes have reached the Eastern Basin off Waverly and Thunder bay...  Late evening around dusk they seem to be coming into about 30 FOW... I met up with  a 14' tinny that bagged 4 nice 25""+... Yes the eyes have arrived, now if the old westerly wind machine can tone down to a nice feeding chop, us little skiffers wil have more time on the open water...  Thanx again Steve realy appreciate the report and always love the Fish Porn...  Will"
