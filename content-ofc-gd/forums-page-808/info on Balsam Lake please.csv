Cheers Mike
368369,Tom McCutcheon,2009-07-31 12:24:00,627,Hey Mike;   I can't help you there cause I have never fished it But you can try giving Ron Reyns a PM on MCI. I know he has covered it quite a bit as recently as two weeks ago. Good luck. If you get any Pike while you are there KEEP THEM FOR A MEAL....  Tom.
368456,Handlebarz,2009-07-31 15:56:00,3790,Thanks Tom I have been trying to get in touch with him but you know he is always working or working on the next bite.

368590,Handlebarz,2009-07-31 21:13:00,3790,thanks for the info guys I will put it to use for sure and post pics if we get luck over there I did just find out that there are two locks between Cameron and Balsam is there a boat launch that is open to the public? I will be coming from Fenolen falls over to there I am sure I can find one some where that will be cheaper then the $80 for teh two locks both ways.
368595,Terry,2009-07-31 21:24:00,14456,"right at rosedale  there is a free launch to balsam, with lots of parking"
368598,Handlebarz,2009-07-31 21:40:00,3790,thank you very much Terry I think we will find it and take advantage of it.
368601,Terry,2009-07-31 21:54:00,14456,"it's been a while I put in on the other side of the lake but 0n highway 35 first road north of the canal between balsam and cameron turn left and left back to the canal, it is almost under the bridge I think it might be coldsteam st to bridge st but don't hold me to it"
368603,mistaredone,2009-07-31 22:05:00,913,Cameron has a public launch in Fenlon falls
