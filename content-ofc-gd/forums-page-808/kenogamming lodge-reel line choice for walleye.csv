Pike are hammerhandle sized. In all honesty the fishing is just ok, maybe. you gotta work for it. Bring alot-ALOT... of minnows, as thats your best bet for the walleye. Gotta have a fishfinder too....  We go up for the fun of it and a chance to get away.  there are better fishing spots....hosts are nice enough."
