368227,Cudz,2009-07-31 01:24:00,2652,"We have decided to have regional g2gs in Barrie and for sure Hamilton area.  Looks like the August 29th is a go.  If you can't make that day you can still compete in the competition as we are going to make it a month long event, all of August (kind of an extended tourney like the Slamon hunt only ours will be bigger .lol)  Aug 1st will be a gong show in Barrie anyway as Kempenfest is going on so the whole waterfront becomes useless and parking fro cars is at a premium let alone parking for cars/trucks trailers.  I will let you know where and when we will meet prior to the 29th in Barrie.  We will have a blast off! haha. Maybe someone people can steep up and work their regional g2gs.  We will get numbers closer to the day with regards to boaters and non boaters.  Want to try and get everyone into boats if we can in Barrie anyway.  Thank you Dan for the poll it was very useful indeed.  Oh by the way I ahve been prefishing. "
