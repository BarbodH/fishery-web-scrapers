My question is about the lakes, will all the heavy rain wreck lake fishing, my buddy is coming down from Montreal and I want to take him out on Rice Lake - is that advisable? Does heavy rains (like we have hade) wreck lake fishing like it does river? Or is that a non-factor. Also will it make Rice more murkey or is that only winds that will make that happen.  Thanks,  Hopefully Aug. will be sunny for 30 days straight!"
