368367,Joey,2009-07-31 12:18:00,9122,This 7 year old didn't want to go to church so bad he stole his parents car to get away.  I love at the end when he runs from the cops  Have a great long weekend everyone    Joey

368370,Roy,2009-07-31 12:29:00,13728,"It don't matter....even if he goes to hell, he's too wet to burn eh?"
368398,Stoty,2009-07-31 13:23:00,2910,HAHAHA! Why didnt I think of that when I was his age?!?!?
368408,ozaibak1,2009-07-31 13:46:00,401,"That was pretty awesome and funny, I'm impressed with the kid's driving skills!"
368412,TC1OZ,2009-07-31 13:56:00,987,Too funny...  Hopefully the parents realize they need to do a better job teaching him right from wrong....
368420,Dara,2009-07-31 14:22:00,3052,"  A kid doing that, I think its already too late. The parents need the teaching"

368479,bigfish1965,2009-07-31 16:33:00,3382,Gotta teach the kids easier ways to get out of church...lol All I had to do was ask for a logical explanation of the whole Noah's Arc thing and how they overcome recessive gene issues by only taking 2 of each. Yeah i was a smartass even at the age of 7.
368482,CLofchik,2009-07-31 16:40:00,854,I see the cops are learning.  They Taser them off camera now.
368489,Roy,2009-07-31 16:57:00,13728,"If you're able to secure a few pics of your priest/minister/rabbi dressing a pig in cute clothing, you can probably  get away with never going to service for the rest of your life. However, spending a little time in your place of worship is not a bad idea."
368526,Dara,2009-07-31 18:21:00,3052,   sure...take the easy way out
