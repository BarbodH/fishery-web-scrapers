Sharpen the hooks then put away? Spit shine?  I have seen people putting a thin layer or cork in the bottom of their planos to soak up some moisture.  How do you take care of all the lures in your box?  This question came to my mind after switching a big bucktail to another bucktail and thinking 'if I keep this up I will no longer have to wash my lures in the lake anymore, I can just leave them in the box.'

368793,Syn,2009-08-01 22:13:00,519,"No weed on it, put it back into the box. I squeeze out the water from the bucktails first. Leaving lures out on the boat makes me lose them, or get them caught in my pants or the net. Treble hooks are also very painful and I don't want any nasty surprises while I excitedly fight a fish."
368795,Burning Babies,2009-08-01 22:18:00,150,"I basically toss them in a pile on the deck, and they air dry for a day or two until I start to organize for my next trip.  I'm not trying to dry them so much as just saving time on the water, but it's a nice side-effect.  I use enough rods equipped with different lure types that I don't usually end up with a very big pile anyway; I just pick up a different rod."
368815,kickingfrog,2009-08-01 23:24:00,8333,"I would recommend NOT using cork in the bottom of a tray. It would just absorb water that would then have to dry.  I ""air-out"" my tackle trays when I get home.  If it was a rainy day I""ll put the fan on them as well."
368887,crankbait,2009-08-02 03:43:00,82,"I just throw it in my plano tackle box, haven't had any issues at all."
