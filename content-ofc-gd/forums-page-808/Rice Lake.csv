368035,gone_fishin,2009-07-30 16:43:00,481,what are you targeting?
368039,bdox,2009-07-30 16:53:00,329,"I would pack some of the following baits; bucktail jigs for walleye, craw imitations, tubes, and white spinnerbaits for smallies, big worms (7""+), big jigs for largies.  The problem I found my first time on Rice was the panfish would hit almost anything. When I started going to bigger baits, I started getting big fish. One morning throwing big craw imitations in 9-12 FOW got me and my wife each a 4lb smallmouth. Now, there is a lot more largemouth water on Rice than smallmouth water, but throwing big baits on Rice is a must for either species of bass."

My cousin and I caught about 40 bass in the week, all with the same lure...  a blue XRap rapala.  medium retrieve, in 3-5' water, fishing shorelines.  Almost all caught in evening, after 7pm.  Let me know if you want more details.  we did try other lures, but this lure has worked like magic for 3 straight years.  Good luck!  Mike"

As for shoreline around sunset, I have caught bass with topwaters like a chug bug. I do well in rivers, horrible in Lakes - experience I guess.  Lot of pressure on Rice, you have to know that."
