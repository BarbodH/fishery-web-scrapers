368427,fishindude,2009-07-31 14:49:00,220,walmart has vinyl ones for $5 they come in navy or army green just picked some up last week!
368442,Governator,2009-07-31 15:24:00,879,"You can get cheap $1 ones at the dollar store, I think dollarama (They are clear in colour).  I bought like 5 of them as emergency back ups last year, they are very compact and great to keep in the tackle box.  If you're looking for a long term solution, I'd invest in a good rain suit."
368447,GBW,2009-07-31 15:35:00,8460,home depot has them too for under $5
368719,Jonny,2009-08-01 13:57:00,1380,We have rain suits but most times we prefer the $1 ponchos you can get (i.e. @ $ama).  Compact and disposable.

Google Scouts Canada to find closest location to you Tight Lines Richard"
