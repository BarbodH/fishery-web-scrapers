368798,marth11,2009-08-01 22:28:00,60,went out bass fishing today and managed a nice largemouth on a tube now for the fun part i know how much my bass weighed how about you guys can you make the guess  
368799,Twocoda,2009-08-01 22:30:00,4130,1 pound 3 ounces
368803,Rich,2009-08-01 22:38:00,3927,Looks like it could have been pretty close to a 2 pounder
368805,Burning Babies,2009-08-01 22:39:00,150,"I'd guess a deep bodied 14""er, around a pound and a half.  How long was it?"
368808,marth11,2009-08-01 22:52:00,60,"you guys are all really close it came to 15"" and about 1.5lbs - 2lbs"
368809,marth11,2009-08-01 22:53:00,60, thats a pretty excat guess
368817,Twocoda,2009-08-01 23:26:00,4130,  i know eh ....im usually within an ounce or two ....( with salmon)....maybe im the rainman of fish weight guessing ....lmao
