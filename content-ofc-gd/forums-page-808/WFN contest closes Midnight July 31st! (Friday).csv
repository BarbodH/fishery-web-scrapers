God luck man, I did the math before, if everybody could pitch in 1 vote you could win...now if they did it twice you would sweet the competion.  Good luck mate, what's the prize?"
368006,Jonny,2009-07-30 14:28:00,1380,"3 votes from 3 different email addy's.  Good luck!  ---  EDIT - Boy, a little shameless cheescake and beefcake there on that site.

368299,Rattletrap2,2009-07-31 03:18:00,1652,"Thanks again everyone!  Some real nice comments on my contest page from some people I have a lot of respect for around here! I really appreciate that as well.  Jocko, I feel the same way about the way some people are going after votes, but hey, to each his/her own! My girls have done a wonderful thing in trying to get me in to this contest.  ONE MORE DAY!!!! We have to keep it going strong until midnight tomorrow!  http://www.wfn.tv/adopt/view.php?entry=360"

368363,Terry,2009-07-31 12:04:00,14456,"yeah others are using all kinds of media to get votes, I didn't think about emailing everyone in the world asking for them...LOL well in 6 hours and 41 minutes I will give my last 10 votes"

368426,Rattletrap2,2009-07-31 14:45:00,1652,"Thanks Guys! You have all been great! I know we all have enough to do these days without trying to keep up on voting, but your efforts to do so are surely appreciated.  I could have spread the word a little better, and I know my kids and Wife have done a lot to get this out, but I really only asked for support from the folks on this board. You all are like family anyways! LOL  Even as it is, I hate to keep pestering with posts on here, but one last day!.  If I was fortunate enough to win, of course there would be a full report on here of the trip!!  Thanks again!!!"

368511,Jonny,2009-07-31 17:50:00,1380,"From the WFN Site:   With that big an ""adjustment"" having been made, maybe Frank might disappear from the contest altogether!"
