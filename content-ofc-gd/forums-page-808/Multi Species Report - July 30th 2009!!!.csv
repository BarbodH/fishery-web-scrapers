368214,Leecher,2009-07-31 00:48:00,7832,"Hello everyone.... hope you all took advantage of this beautiful sunny day and got some fishing done Me and Paul certainly did!!!   Mission today was targeting eyes on our favorite lake, Lac St-Marie.  Got up at 4:45am, temperature was 14C and no wind, left around 5:30am.  Made a pit stop for some Timmies and the way we go... destination Lac St-Marie.  Got to destination around 6:45am, the lake was crystal clear, got the boat launched and proceeded to our favorite spot on the lake... surface temp was 71F and got up to 75F mid afternoon.... but on our way over.... stopped to work the shoreline on one of the many islands and got greeted by these little fellows    No takers at this point.... so Paul positioned the boat for our first drift and I was going to rig a rod with a jig and twister tail but forgot the package at home in my other tackle box So instead, rigged it with a 3"" white power tube and a dew worm.... and this is the first fish of the day    A 23"" channel cat that gave me one hell of a fight!!!  PB this season so had to get another shot of it LOL Here it is solo style LOL  Sorry Mike.... I couldn't resist LOL    Not long after that... still on the first drift... got rewarded again with another PB... a 16 1/2"" sauger or Dor√© noir in French!!!  Not often do we get them this big around here    We then reposition the boat and got drifting again but for a while did not get any takers so we moved to another spot.... Once we arrived, got rigged up with a Gulp 5"" sinking minnow and into the water and BANG!  Another channel cat LOL a little smaller.... you can actually see the minnow hanging from it's yap LOL    Then cast again and get this one on the tube    Here's another shot of it with the tube in it's yap!!!  The white tube really produce well today for me and just could not believe the results!!!    Then Paul get's rewarded with this beauty... LMB on a white Spro Frog!!!    We worked this area for a while but just could not land any so we moved to another part of the lake, which meant, had to go through a tunnel with the boat.   Here's a couple of shots  Entering the tunnel...    and half way through    This section of the lake is shallow with lots of weed flats and loaded with LMB.... so we gave her a try and had a blast.  Landed about 20 bass and 4 - 5 pikes each... nothing big but lots of fun.... here is one I got  on the BigO as soon as we arrived    and Paul with a beauty on Gulp!!!    Once this frenzy was over, we moved to another area on the main lake, into another bay and I was rewarded with my second eye of the day on a BigO!!!    and again solo style LOL    Lures of choice for today was Buzz bait, Spro frog, White Spinnerbait, Gulp 5"" sinking minnows, jigs with twister tail and 3"" white power tubes tipped with dew worms and jitter bug leopard green color.  Thanks Paul for this beauty day!!!! Hope you enjoy Leechman"
