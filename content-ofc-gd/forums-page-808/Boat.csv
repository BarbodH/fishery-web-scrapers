The wife wants a boat that she can suntan on and be able to do some water sports, me on the other hand, I want it for fishing and fishing only.  Any suggestions on what kinda  boat would meet both our needs?  Also is there any other place to look besides Autotrader, Kijiji, and Ebay?  Thanks for your help"
