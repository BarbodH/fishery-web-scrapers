Asked me a question if i saw a cat on any of my trail cameras.  I pulled the cards on saturday morning and no cat on all 3. He told me the area the other neighbor believes he saw the Cougar. So I jump on my buddy's ATV and down the trail to the ""pond"" we go.  Here is the picture of what we found. Look closely and you can see the middle paw pad print."

1081544,ketchenany,2022-08-08 16:40:00,3229,That would be a Cougurette!
1081545,CrowMan,2022-08-08 18:02:00,413,"Yes....definitely could be a ""Cougar""   "
1081547,Fisherman,2022-08-08 21:23:00,7201,"Yuck, that's disgusting."
1081548,CrowMan,2022-08-08 23:00:00,413,"I think a lot of us, at one time or another, have woken up bleary-eyed with that same thought...especially when it comes to cougars..."
1081639,DanD,2022-08-13 20:15:00,2223,Sorry here but I have to laugh. A serous question (which I cannot help with) which then turns into a cougar funny?  Yeah this cougar needs to be put down for the sake of all other cougars that still have some self respect. Anyone really have an idea of what the tracks were made from? Dan...
