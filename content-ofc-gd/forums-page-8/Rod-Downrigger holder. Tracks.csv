1081632,glen,2022-08-13 17:22:00,2641,I’m thinking about putting tracks on my boat.  Two 24”.  Looks like the parts are hard to get.   	what brand are people using?  	Terry any thoughts?
1081633,glen,2022-08-13 17:27:00,2641,I guess I need mounts for my downeasters x2.  Downriggersx2.  Tube rod holdersx2.

1081636,Terry,2022-08-13 18:02:00,14456,I had 24 inch on my Lund they are great because I had 3 different types of rod holders that all fit in the tracks. I just bought the cheapest I could find at the time that was comparable with the most makes of mounts    Brian made a couple of mounts for me to save even more money traxstech was the make I had
1081641,glen,2022-08-13 20:50:00,2641,I keep waffling on it.  Thing’s have changed since this morning.  Now I might not Downrigger out of my boat any more this year.  Earliest I’d need them is next summer.  By then I might have a different boat. Lol.

1081646,pics,2022-08-14 01:28:00,1268,The cannon track isn't cheap but it seems sturdy. I got mine from Grimsby Tackle.. Bills bait in Hamilton may also have some..
1081696,fishdawg,2022-08-16 03:24:00,912,Grimsby Tackle has good stock of tracks & rod holders from Cannon & Custom Fishing Solutions.  Also all the other parts/accessories/materials plus the guidance to complete the instal.
