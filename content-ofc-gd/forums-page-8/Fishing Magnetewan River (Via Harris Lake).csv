Not sire if a 16' boat can go through especially at this time of the year.  We intend to camp along that stretch of river as there is crown camping there but I've never been up there.  Otherwise we will have to find somewhere else, although Harris Lake may have crown camping as well, which is an option.  Thanks"

1081717,siwash,2022-08-17 14:20:00,683,Thanks... I guess I could raise the motor and use the trolling motor how's the fishing ?
1081718,BillM,2022-08-17 14:27:00,17367,Always a good day for me on the Mag.  Great smallie fishery.
1081721,siwash,2022-08-17 14:35:00,683,I've heard the bass fishing is decent.. and pike. Assuming walleye will be thought bite unless we are out at night. Are there a lot of rock hazards?  thanks

1081783,siwash,2022-08-21 20:27:00,683,Just cam back. All small mouth. One tiny pike. Biggest Amalie was about 2lbs. Lots of little guys. Good fun and beautiful place.  Rock hazards were not too bad. But definitely need to watch it especially near the points as they extended out pretty shallow. nice area - semi remote wilderness not too far from home. I'll post pic of the biggest small mouth once my buddy shares it.
1081792,siwash,2022-08-22 01:55:00,683,"Pics from trip.. the site was furnished for us! Amazing. Does the ministry do this? I've seen sites with some basic prep tables, maybe a bench. This one had a toilet that was better than what I have a home!  Anyone know what animal that is? Bear or canine?        "
