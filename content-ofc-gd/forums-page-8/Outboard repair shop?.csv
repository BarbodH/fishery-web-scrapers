1081551,siwash,2022-08-09 01:29:00,683,"Hey folks,  Recently bought engine is running fine but I want a mechanic to check out the impeller/water pump.  Does anyone know of a good, honest older outboard mechanic in Southern Simcoe County, Central/Northern York Region?  I am near Schomberg (but closer to the 400).  The motor is a 1979 Evinrude 25 HP.  Thanks"
1081554,smitty55,2022-08-09 02:02:00,928,If it's pissing out well and the water isn't real hot then I wouldn't be too worried about it. If you want someone to check it out they would have to remove it anyway so you may as well replace it then.
1081555,siwash,2022-08-09 02:32:00,683,"On those older motors, does water piss out from exhaust as well as the side?  That's what seems to be happening which I find odd.  What comes out of exhaust is pretty warm, borderline hot... a lesser amount comes out of what appears to be a side port.  I need to see a diagram to confirm where that motor is supposed to spill its water."
1081556,siwash,2022-08-09 02:45:00,683,"So if I bought this I suppose I could change out the whole thing?  Never done before, but may attempt it with Youtube!  http://(https://www.marineengine.com/newparts/part_details.php?pnum=OMC0389980),"
1081561,Fisherman,2022-08-09 17:27:00,7201,Yes on some of the older models water does come out with the exhaust.
1081562,Rizzo,2022-08-09 17:47:00,4754,I am not techy at all but did use Youtube to pull out an impeller before. My guess is if I can do it so can you.
1081563,misfish,2022-08-09 18:53:00,29133,"I can do that, but had to youtube on how to replace a head light bulb on the 2014 Ram.  Remember the days when you removed 4 screws to remove the chrome plate that held the head light in and just replace the head light?"
1081628,GYPSY400,2022-08-13 11:09:00,191,"Yes that is normal, the water coming out with the exhaust is meant the cool the muffler. As long as it's peeing out the side at idle it will be fine for the rest of the year.. if it's intermittent or really weak at idle it needs to be done asap.  You can find videos on YouTube on how to do it for that model of motor - the hardest part is disconnecting the shift linkage ( I think there is an oval shaped plate for access)  .  Learn how to do it yourself and you will gain satisfaction and save money..  or buy a box of beer and invite one of you mechanical inclined friends over. That's a good job for the off season, along with changing the foot oil and maybe a new set of spark plugs. Spend the extra money for OEM water pump and you'll be trouble free for 5 seasons.   Also run only Ethanol free fuel ( shell Vpower) to save on fuel system issues down the road"
