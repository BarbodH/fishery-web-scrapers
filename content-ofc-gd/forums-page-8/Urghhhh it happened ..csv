Gotta thank Kawartha Prop !! They are the guys to see should this happen !!!. Pounded the skeg back to semi straight , replaced prop (stainless being reconditioned) and back in the water in 40min , temp fix so we could enjoy the rest of the week .. No major damage (fingers crossed ) but Jesus what a sound !! Best part …..  happened on the boats second voyage !      "
1081814,captpierre,2022-08-22 23:51:00,2521,Worst sound is right. Too bad that happened. I think I’ve seen you fish Pigeon recently. Kawartha Prop are awesome. I agree.
1081824,Podric,2022-08-23 13:45:00,46,The prop shop is good because the lakes allow them to gain a lot of experience.  Welcome to the club. At least you don't have to worry about having a perfect skeg and prop anymore.

1081847,porkpie,2022-08-24 14:27:00,2521,"Nice boat pal!  Don’t feel bad, I put a tiny crease in the very bottom of my hull on lower Buck 2 years ago on water I know very well.  Fortunately I was going very slow, and fortunately you can hardly tell it’s there, and the boat doesn’t leak any.  But I know it’s there LOL.  I’ve smoked a few props and one lower unit over the years as well.  It happens sometimes!"
1081895,Rizzo,2022-08-29 01:37:00,4754,terrible feeling for sure! Glad you got it fixed pronto.
