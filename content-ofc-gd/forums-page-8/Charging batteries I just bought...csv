1081682,siwash,2022-08-15 23:44:00,683,Just bought a G27 deep cycle and a dual purpose 24 Marine. Based on the charger I have (see attached) what should I put my charging settings at?  thanks..  
1081684,akaShag,2022-08-15 23:47:00,2073,a buddy who is an electrician says use the highest amps you have for charging deep cycle batteries. But I would buy an intelligent battery charger that shuts off when the battery is fully charged.............. Doug

1081697,siwash,2022-08-16 03:50:00,683,"I'll check out the intelligent charger... So could you ""over charge"" with what I got?  No risk of damage?"
1081698,siwash,2022-08-16 11:22:00,683,Any recommendations for a good charger (under $100 preferably)?

1081707,DRIFTER_016,2022-08-16 15:19:00,10439,I have an older version of this one that I use.  https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/motomaster-classic-series-smart-battery-charger-maintainer-fully-automatic-15-8-2-amp-12v-0111975p.html?loc=plp

1081722,siwash,2022-08-17 14:39:00,683,The one I got seems to be working well... Batteries seem good  may just stick to what I got for now.
