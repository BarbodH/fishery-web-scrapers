I don't want to hurt my wallet so much either and I am guessing I don't need to change up lures so much to hit on the right one for the day but I could be wrong. I have a few musky lures orange big jake, a couple of suick styled ones. Large 4"" + buck tail length spinners. Any lure suggestions for slow 8""+ baits?"
1081827,CrowMan,2022-08-23 14:31:00,413,"Lots of choices in smaller Musky hard baits beyond Jakes and Suicks...however non are cheap: Believers, Triple D's, Super Shad Raps, Super Shadow Rap, SaltWater X-Raps, Producers, Raiders, Ernie's, Chaos Minis...to name a few With bucktails...I always have a rod ready to go with Double CowGirls...there's something about the Esox species and spinners.. Also don't overlook spoons for Pike...a large Williams Whitefish hammered gold/silver tipped with a 4"" curly tail grub has put countless big snot rockets in the net for me..."
1081858,kickingfrog,2022-08-24 23:32:00,8333,Big spoons and spinners might be the best option for size/effectiveness/quality on a budget. I'd be tempted to tip them with plastic curlytails and whatnot but they have been deadly without them for generations.

I caught many big pike with the Zoom Magnum Super Fluke (7"") and 6""/8"" curly tail grubs from Kalins/BassPro. The BassPro Shops grubs are reasonably priced. Look for the saltwater version as well. Same plastic, but just a few different colours. I fish these weightless with a single hook on a solid wire leader, but can easily add a bit of weight when needed. The BPS Offshore Angler Shad aren't too badly priced as well (watch for a sale). Once the water gets a bit warmer, spoons are my go to. So easy to fish and they basically last forever. The Yellowbird Doctor Spoon (4.5""),  Len Thompson Original/Platinum No. 4 (1 1/8 oz) and the Dimpled Series No.16 (1 2/5oz) work great for me.  Williams and Eppinger have a lot of options as well. I have even used Salmon spoons with great success - they just don't cast as far due to the weight. Flies can be fun to fish with as well. You don't need a fly rod to use them either, as you can use a spin bubble if you have trouble casting them. Inline spinners and spinnerbaits are great too. Tons of options."
