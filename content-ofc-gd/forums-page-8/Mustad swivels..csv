1081679,CrowMan,2022-08-15 23:01:00,413,"Yes, I agree..the ""Stay-Lok"" snaps are a pain. However, a couple of things...I wouldn't use a swivel on a crankbait, just the snap. I feel the swivel is unnecessary on a non-rotating lure and detracts from the action. Secondly, if I am using a swivel, I always use a ball-bearing type..just had too many of those barrel swivels freeze up and cause me grief....buts that's just me."

1081825,Podric,2022-08-23 13:50:00,46,Use bearing swivel. Use a few foot of mono lead from the swivel to the lure.  This setup also allows for spoons and spinners. Use a loop knot like the instructions that came with the lure said to do. If you must use a swivel....I would go for something that ends in a smooth loop. If you are super organized and have lots of time you can add mono leads to all your lures and snap them on.  You may be envied.
