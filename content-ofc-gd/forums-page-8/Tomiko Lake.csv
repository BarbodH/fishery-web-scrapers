917468,lhousesoccer,2015-05-28 22:38:00,442,"My Dad booked a trip for October on Tomiko Lake north of Nipissing with a couple other guys.  A little fishing in the mornings, a little bird hunting in the afternoons.  I'm not going, but I thought I'd try to get some info for him.  He's not too savvy on the interweb, so I'm asking for him.  Feel free to post, or PM.  He's mostly interested in walleye (eating) and maybe some pike (not eating, just catching for fun ....any trophy sized fish in there?).  Lake doesn't seem to be on Navionics chips.  What else is in there that might be fun (and/or tasty) for him to catch.  He's 72 so he's not going to be fishing any all-day marathons.  Thanks!"
917491,irishfield,2015-05-29 02:29:00,26272,This is the only help I can give on the lake. Pictures are looking West.          
917492,Gallie,2015-05-29 02:40:00,1215,"Nice shots, that would help me lol"
917494,TJQ,2015-05-29 03:02:00,7806,see that little island wayyyyy out in the middle in the first pic....  try around that in the evenings....
917525,SirCranksalot,2015-05-29 16:16:00,3291,The Backroads book says troll big spoons around islands near dusk!!
917532,adempsey,2015-05-29 16:39:00,1498,Angler's Atlas has some depth maps.  http://www.anglersatlas.com/lake/102505
917554,jimmer,2015-05-29 19:14:00,2730,"Looks like a great lake to explore. That makes catching something a great reward. I have always looked at this lake, but never made the trip. Hope you do well!"
917713,Walleye72,2015-05-30 19:24:00,156,"I've been going to Lake Tomiko almost every year since 2003 and I know the lake pretty well, although there is always more to learn.  I talked to a very knowledgeable person with a camp on the lake last year and discovered a bunch of new spots.  I could PM you some info.  The only thing is that I haven't fished in the fall, only in the late spring and summer.   If I can find my map of the lake I could fill it out and mail it to you.  Maybe the lodge I stay at could send me one.  I'll have a look and see what I can do.  I'm happy to share what I know."
917744,Craigson,2015-05-30 22:30:00,117,I fished it for one afternoon about 5yrs ago. It was over 100degrees Farenheit tho n we only managed a cpl small bass. Wemarked fish on the bottom in like 80ft of water n tried jigging for them but no luck.  We basically had zero direction on what part of the lake to fish.
917944,Muskieman,2015-05-31 23:40:00,2472,"It's a very good lake , PM me closer to that time and I'll give you recent news , fall fishing is very good on uncle Tom ."
917956,lhousesoccer,2015-06-01 00:58:00,442,"Thanks so much everyone for all the tips.  The aerial photos are awesome, and the link to the depth chart much appreciated.  Will certainly help my Dad narrow down some fishing spots (like the tiny island!).  For the guys who've offered more detailed info via PM, I'll definitely be in touch that way.  Much appreciated!"
918087,Muskieman,2015-06-01 21:31:00,2472,"the last 2 photos are of lake Chebogan , they're connected via a narrows"
918526,irishfield,2015-06-04 16:26:00,26272,I got you a new picture of the best part of the lake this morning at 7am !!
918531,lhousesoccer,2015-06-04 17:04:00,442,"Sweet!  Thanks so much! I used to have dreams of getting my float plane license.  Never happened.  Maybe it's not too late.  I'm only in my mid-40's!  I think I can pick that island out in your photo on the depth chart map I downloaded from the link someone provided earlier.  Are those 3 other dots closer to shore also islands?  That's the north shore of the lake, correct?"
918541,irishfield,2015-06-04 17:55:00,26272,"Yes.. I was headed SOUTH at 7am, unfortunately! 3 dots look to be large rocks at best. I don't think it's debris in the water, but could be considering how high everything is right now. Picture is of the swelled river headed into Sturgeon Falls.  ...and it's never too late to get into flying. I can even sell you a plane..."
918566,Handlebarz,2015-06-04 22:32:00,3790,"Tomiko is a great lake I have only been for May 24 weekend and they have some great walleye there last trip for me was 2008 last trip that was a great memory for me there was 2007 with dad I actually got a 27.5"" walleye replica done for dad of the biggest one from that trip. Minnows on jigheads were always a good go to or trolling worm harnesses. there is no place to buy minnows there as the two lodges that had them only sold to their customers that were staying at their place."

1073108,Costlesscatchmore,2021-05-08 19:57:00,10,Old post but if anyone is still following we have an island on Chebogan  we  do alright for walleye is tomiko better ?
1081785,Millsy,2022-08-21 20:42:00,1,If anyone is willing to share any fall spots on Tomiko or the adjacent lake I’d be grateful. If fished in the summer and happy to share.
1081889,Bruceroy,2022-08-27 21:53:00,2,Also Looking for same tips. Heading there Aug. 28 - Aug. 30th. Any tips  would be appreciated. Thanks
