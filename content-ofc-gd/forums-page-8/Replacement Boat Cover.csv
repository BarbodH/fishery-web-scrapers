1081702,duke2555,2022-08-16 13:10:00,19,I need to get a replacement cover for my LUND 1625 XL SC with trolling motor. My cover was damaged in the May storm. From what I am reading 600D is what most covers are made out of for material... I have read positive and negative about having a boat cover go over the outboard motor...I would like to protect it from fading in the sun when not in use. Any suggestions close to Peterborough? Thanks!
