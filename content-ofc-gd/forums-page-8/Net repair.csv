1081930,OhioFisherman,2022-08-30 20:02:00,6623,Some power pro or similar and a needle? anything over 50lb test should remain break free in a net?
1081931,Podric,2022-08-30 20:32:00,46,"OK.  I have small, black zip ties and will try them.  Took maybe 20. Power Pro could be a second choice because I think it may cut through the fragile netting on this one.  Zipties are wide. Thanks all! "
