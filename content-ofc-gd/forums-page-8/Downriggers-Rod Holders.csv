1081712,John,2022-08-16 21:57:00,2956,Has anyone got/put tracks or downrigger/rodholder mounts on a glass boat? Any info would be appreciated.
1081713,Fisherman,2022-08-16 22:12:00,7201,"Years ago I did an install for a fellow with a Peterborough tri hull,  We used extensive amounts of real 3/4 ply under the gunnels to reinforce them.  Even then you could detect a bit of flex when the water got a rough.  Careful when you drill the fibreglass,  start with small bits and cover the hole areas with masking tape to prevent chipping."
1081714,CrowMan,2022-08-16 23:54:00,413,"Same as above, but I used 1"" StarBoard HDPE as a backer under the glass."
1081720,CrowMan,2022-08-17 14:34:00,413,"One more thing...yes as Fisherman suggests drill a pilot hole before going bigger, but before you make any holes, use a counter-sink bit first...that way you won't chip the gel-coat. Just use a center punch to begin, so it doesn't wander."
