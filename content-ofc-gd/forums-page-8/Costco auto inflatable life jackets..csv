1081359,Podric,2022-07-29 00:35:00,46,Shhhhh keep it down!  They came in late in the season and I am waiting for them to go on clearance.  That can't happen if people buy them!
1081360,captpierre,2022-07-29 00:53:00,2521,"Probably a good idea to wear one all the time on the water. Costco’s return policy is great so if it’s not comfortable, back it goes."
1081364,Podric,2022-07-29 03:14:00,46,"This is why we can't have nice things.  Easy enough to try out in the store. Working against my own interests: The Costco sign says ""automatic or manual"" also the model number in the picture looks like that one is an automatic model. Costco also sells 2 recharge canisters for $54."
1081365,Fisherman,2022-07-29 03:19:00,7201,Yes but are they Transport Canada approved?
1081366,Podric,2022-07-29 04:59:00,46,I was going to cry FUD! but that was before looking at the mfg page and reading the manual.  Not a mention of Canada approval anywhere! After some further digging this isn't the first year Costco has sold these.  Last year they cleared them out for $50. This site here appears to be a Costco return clearance center: https://www.rjpwholesale.com/products/havasu-24-gm-automaticmanual-inflatable-pfd They list it as Transport Canada approved.  I guess someone has to go an check the product or ask Costco and check for the stamp before buying.
1081372,Fisherman,2022-07-29 16:08:00,7201,Ya better to look in the store first if you can.
1081499,captpierre,2022-08-04 17:45:00,2521,On sale now.  Gonna try one
1081530,Cosmos,2022-08-07 17:00:00,588,Thank you. Got 2 for my wife and daughter!
1081567,greyhawk,2022-08-10 15:14:00,33,"Here is an answer to Fisherman’s post Lifejackets approved by the U.S. Coast Guard are not Canadian-approved. However, visitors to Canada may bring their own lifejacket to use on a pleasure craft as long as it fits and it conforms to the laws of their home country."
1081568,captpierre,2022-08-10 15:17:00,2521,They are approved by Transport Canada.
