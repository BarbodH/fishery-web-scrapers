1082053,Podric,2022-09-09 01:49:00,46,I have an almost new 12V 10Ah litium-ion battery. Only problem is I let it sit for 4 years so I am pretty sure it is dead as a doornail but revive suggestions are welcome. Anyone know of best inexpensive source for Li-Ion batteries? Preferably I would like 2 smaller ones in parallel instead of 1 big one but price is a big factor.

1082065,Podric,2022-09-10 14:17:00,46,I started doing some research. Brining an Li-ion battery to life can be very dangerous. I may try.  thanks.
