1081769,captpierre,2022-08-20 20:12:00,2521,Regular $142.9 no ethanol free 91 available. Don’t know if that’s just today or ongoing. Too bad. Needed some for the boat.
1081770,GBW,2022-08-20 23:48:00,8460,What of the 1st 3 stations?
1081772,John,2022-08-21 13:00:00,2956,Will be there next week..
1081775,AKRISONER,2022-08-21 15:19:00,5558,Sounds like he’s talking about Gen 7  if you go across to Terry’s typically their premium is actually ethanol free because it’s supplied by shell rather than the native refinery.
1081776,captpierre,2022-08-21 15:46:00,2521,Neither Gen 7 or Terry had premium. Only regular. I didn’t check the third station. There is a native refinery?  Are you sure about your facts?
1081779,GBW,2022-08-21 17:01:00,8460,"I tend to go to the one beside (same side as Terry's) because it's newer, the prices are fine, I get my smokes there too BUT it's clean and less busy as everyone thinks Terry's is the cat's meow. They have a sticker on the pump saying ""this weeks gas is supplied by ____"" and most times it's Shell."
1081786,AKRISONER,2022-08-21 21:49:00,5558,Yes…I can’t think of the supplier off of the top of my head but they operate their own refinery now and supply fuel under one brand to all of the reserve gas stations across the province.
1081788,captpierre,2022-08-21 21:53:00,2521,I’m thinking a refinery is a $100 million plus operation. Having a hard time imagining natives own one.
1081789,AKRISONER,2022-08-21 22:16:00,5558,"My bad. It’s original traders energy, they blend and distribute fuel. I don’t know the specifics of how the fuel industry works personally, but I know their supplier is native owned and operated. I wouldn’t know who actually refines the fuel"
1081791,captpierre,2022-08-22 00:48:00,2521,I would prefer to know the supplier is Shell or Esso. Will check out the other guy next to Terry
1081819,fisherman7,2022-08-23 13:02:00,325,"Do you mean Curve Lake Gas, which is a gas station on the water (with one road pump) or gas at Curve Lake, as in the Curve Lake Reserve area with the 3 roadside gas stations?"
1081820,captpierre,2022-08-23 13:05:00,2521,The 3 large stations
1081821,captpierre,2022-08-23 13:16:00,2521,"Just called. The third station, Quarter Mile, said they never ran out of ethanol free premium. And that they sell brand name-Esso and Shell. Terry’s  and Gen 7 were out on the weekend but got delivery today. They apparently get the fuel from Native supplier."
1081855,AKRISONER,2022-08-24 22:39:00,5558,Esso/imperial oil premium is not ethanol free…so take them saying that their premium is ethanol free with a grain of salt.
1081859,captpierre,2022-08-25 00:40:00,2521,"I’ve always understood Shell, Esso and Costco premium were ethanol free."
