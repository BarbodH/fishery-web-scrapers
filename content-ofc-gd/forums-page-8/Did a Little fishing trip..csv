1081585,glen,2022-08-11 21:30:00,2641,Went on a trip into the woods. Â No net man/camera man. Â Armed with new lures made by board member. Â Tied lure on then put over side of the boat and couldnâ€™t get the lure down. A fish hit it as I lowered it down! Â  Two seconds of fishing time and fish on. Â In 15min I landed two 5lb lakers and a 2.5lb whitefish. Â (Sorry no pics). Â Satisfied with that I went bass fishing. Caught some nice ones. Drove around in the boat about 80miles. Â  Â Stayed on the trip until I started talking to myself and when I didnâ€™t like what I was hearing I packed up and came home.

1081623,glen,2022-08-13 01:04:00,2641,Iâ€™m going again this time with camera man. Â  	Only used one of the lures. Â Hooks are sharp too. Â  The hair stays open as the lure swims giving it more movement. Â  Â Next time Iâ€™m going to try the smaller ones for whitefish. Â  	It is special to catch a fish on a lure made by a friend. Â Made in Ontario.
