The price diff between the 55lb and the 80lb is not much, the biggest thing is the 12v one battery vs the 24v two batteries...my battery compartment at the bow for the trolling motor has a holder for the battery, but I think it is just for a single battery, although there is room for two batteries in the compartment. thoughts?

1081733,CrowMan,2022-08-18 12:25:00,413,"55lb thrust should be plenty for a 16 footer, plus there is no eay easy way to add a second trolling battery in that boat. However make sure you get the i-pilot...it is a game changer. Between spot lock and auto-pilot it will change the way you fish."
1081735,porkpie,2022-08-18 13:00:00,2521,"I owned a very similar boat before getting  my 18 footer, mine was slightly  narrower but similar draft etc.. A 55lb will throw it around just fine.  I could spot lock in Detroit river current with no trouble, and wind caused me no grief.  If your primarily a troller though, and constantly use the Minn kota as auto pilot, I recommend the 80lb thrust. The one problem I had was I destroyed batteries when only running off the one.  Even with the biggest battery I could stuff in the compartment, they didn’t last as long as the performance I’m getting running 2, and the battery suffered for it.  For general bass fishing, jigging, perch fishing and other stuff, you’ll be good to go with a 55."
1081753,AKRISONER,2022-08-19 18:32:00,5558,"if you can afford it always go with more power. Thats my two cents, you never regret having more motor."
1081758,BillM,2022-08-19 19:32:00,17367,80lb for sure.  You can never have too much trolling motor.
