1081896,limeyangler,2022-08-29 11:47:00,5204,"Hi all, anyone know which eye on these lures does is for shallow dives? Top or bottom eye."
1081897,misfish,2022-08-29 11:51:00,29133,I would think the bottom one Simon. It would pull up when retrieving.
1081898,Rizzo,2022-08-29 12:53:00,4754,shallow eye believer 6 feet of line out in prop wash with rod tip jammed in water...gets em every time. Go get em
1081900,limeyangler,2022-08-29 13:13:00,5204,"All well and good Arizona, but which eye is the shallow eye?"
1081901,limeyangler,2022-08-29 13:17:00,5204,"Thanks Brian, but that sounds like a (reasonable) guess. I just can’t find a ‘for sure’ answer. It’s  not on the packet, I can’t find it anywhere online so I thought I’d try here."
1081902,BillM,2022-08-29 13:31:00,17367,Closer to the end of the bait = shallow.  Further away = deeper.
1081903,Terry,2022-08-29 13:33:00,14456,Closer to the  front end or the back end.   	lol
1081904,lew,2022-08-29 13:49:00,12766,Front eye shallow....rear eye deep.
1081905,limeyangler,2022-08-29 14:12:00,5204,Thanks Lew!
1081916,misfish,2022-08-29 19:16:00,29133,That s what I said. LMAO 
1081917,misfish,2022-08-29 19:17:00,29133,"A guess maybe, but it,s IMO,the most logical answer. LOL "
1081918,limeyangler,2022-08-29 19:25:00,5204,"Lol, all good, appreciate the input, helps to confirm."
