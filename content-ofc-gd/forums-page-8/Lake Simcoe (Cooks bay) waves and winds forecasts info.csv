Unfortunately, these apps dont show anything for lake Simcoe.  Is there any way to read the potential waves forecasts?  My guess for cooks bay would that if the wind was blowing toward the north, it should be calm, and the opposite if the winds were blowing to the south? Any help in this regard would be appreciated.  Planning to fish simcoe  when the salmon run is done in a few weeks."
