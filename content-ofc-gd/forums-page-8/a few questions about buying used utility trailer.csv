1073755,huzzsaba,2021-06-01 23:33:00,884,"I'm interested in buying a small utility to haul my inflatable boat around rather than constantly deflating and inflating. I have my eyes on one that fits the bill and size as well.  Seller had never got it registered, and will sell it as is.  Here are my questions: 1) How easy is it to register a used (never previously registered) trailer? 2) Do I need plates on it to bring it back home? Or is bill of sale enough? 3) How easy is it to register?  Ive heard I can mention it is homemade, which I believe it is.  Thanks."
1073758,Fisherman,2021-06-02 00:23:00,7201,"Answers: A homemade trailer – one you built yourself – must still be registered. Bring your driver’s licence or other government-issued identification (for example, your passport to the ServiceOntario centre to register a homemade trailer. You can weigh your trailer at any Ministry of Transportation Motor Vehicle Inspection Station. Look for the green-and-white sign along highways. There are more than 12,000 stations across Ontario. Once you confirm the trailer’s weight exceeds 900kg, bring the following documents to the ServiceOntario centre: The cost to get a plate, permit and validation sticker is $72. Remember you only have to register a trailer once. If you are registering a new trailer, or a used or homemade trailer, you must pay applicable taxes: Any outstanding defaulted fines against the registrant (person who is registering the trailer) must be paid to be able to register the trailer. You can use any of the following payment methods at the ServiceOntario centre: Once you register your recreational or utility trailer at the ServiceOntario centre, you get your plate and permit right away – all in one visit. Attach the licence plate to the back of your trailer where it is clearly visible. Always carry your permit, or a copy of it, to show to a police officer if asked.

1073762,Hack_Fisherman,2021-06-02 02:57:00,720,"my thoughts exactly. So...a person must tow the trailer on a trailer, figure out how to load and unload and all at the mto scale. I bet they’d love that"
1073763,huzzsaba,2021-06-02 03:31:00,884,"Lol, looks like its not as easy then to register an unregistered homemade trailer. I was thinking of the same thing of trailering it on another trailer.  All good deals are out of town so it really makes it not so good of a deal once you factor in everything.  Easiest would be to drive it back unplated with bill of sale and register it once its home, but dont want to take a chance with the 1.5 hour drive back down the 401"
1073764,BillM,2021-06-02 04:01:00,17367,Just get a temp plate for it.  Simple stuff.
1073765,Hack_Fisherman,2021-06-02 10:25:00,720," your trailer will not exceed 900kg empty so you don’t need the weigh in crap. I’m sure an estimated weight and carrying capacity will suffice. (Axle rating minus dry weight of trailer materials) lots of people register trailers as homemade, even if they are not (ie bought without ownership because seller can’t find it)"
1073766,Garnet,2021-06-02 10:26:00,2056,I would take my boat trailer plate with me and bring the utility trailer home then deal with the home made trailer issue.
1073773,akaShag,2021-06-02 18:46:00,2073,I bet that if you walked along a mile of the 401 you would FIND a trailer plate!  😁
1073784,16 Footer,2021-06-03 09:21:00,191,"The plastic plate mount on my new box trailer broke off the first time I used it. Fortunately I did not lose my plate, remounted it using sheet metal."
1073803,Dara,2021-06-04 00:28:00,3052,"I built a trailer, went to service ontario and said I wanted plates for my homemade trailer, paid 40 bucks and got a plate and ownership. I think they may have told me to write the vin number they gave me on the trailer. You are not allowed to put your boat trailer plates on another trailer but it is fairly common practice to have one plate for multiple trailers. Works well if you have multiple home made trailers"
1073804,Hack_Fisherman,2021-06-04 03:03:00,720,Especially when they are the same colour and you forgot to write the vin on it. but I’d rather shell out $40 so I didn’t have to switch the plates. Easier to sell it later also
1073807,porkpie,2021-06-04 10:59:00,2521,"I’ve registered a few trailers as homemade.  It’s pretty easy with small trailers.  I’ve also slapped on old plate on with zip ties To bring a new boat or trailer home on several occasions.   The odds you’ll get pinched are very slim.  I’d wager 20 percent of trailers aren’t properly licensed, maybe more.  Anyway as the guys above mentioned It really shouldn’t be very hard to do."
1081871,jdesma,2022-08-26 01:48:00,1,"Just like Dara said. Visited Service Ontario, said I wanted to register a homemade trailer. They asked color & weight. That was pretty much it. Paid $72 though, boohoo."
