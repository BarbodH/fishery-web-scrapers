240702,Rizzo,2008-08-18 01:02:00,4754,"Last week was a busy week with selling my 99 Lowe, and 2 days later getting a 2001 Princecraft. Thanks to all who comforted me after I thought I screwed it up royally on its maiden voyage (see ""brutal day"" thread)! Either way, here are some gratuitous pics of the new girl. For a 2001 she looks real clean. The previous owner actually bought it new non-current in 2003. He figures he used it less than 10 times over the past 5 years and I believe it...not a scratch top be seen.        yes, that is a little boys arm you can see on the floor. My two boys love to play in the boat (again see brutal day thread) and I told them to hide so I could take a picture. The one tucked up real nicely out of site under the console...the other, well, this is the best he did at ""hiding"" in the 10 shots I took of this angle! Either way, I'm real excited to get this hub thing figured out and get it back in the water."

240799,Rizzo,2008-08-18 13:41:00,4754,"Not sure how fast it goes, but when I was looking for advice on this boat, somebody posted they had the same boat with a 40 on it and it went 31 mph. This one has a 50, so I guess more than 31 mph!"
