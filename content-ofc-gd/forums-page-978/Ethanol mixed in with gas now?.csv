Has anyone else heard of this? Am I going to have to add that sta-bil stuff to my gasoline if now for my outboard?  Also, if I add that sta-bil stuff to my gas for my outboard does it counter-act the adverse effects of running ethanol through my outboard or does it just keep the alchohol from seperating from the gas if it's sitting for too long?  Thanks."

241111,Greencoachdog,2008-08-19 02:06:00,8163,10% Ethanol in gasoline isn't anything new by a long shot!
241115,PatrickGG,2008-08-19 02:10:00,562,Esso has been doing the ethanol mix for a while now and i am pretty sure other major fuel companies have been doing the same especially Sunoco i dont think it will affect your outboard at all.

241123,jwl,2008-08-19 02:19:00,1056,"most 2 stroke oils have had additives in them for years now to help compensate for the addage of Ethanol in the gas...most motors just say not to use more than 10% ethanol gas. Never had a single problem in 5 years with my oil injected Merc, and it gets used alot over the years"
