240633,Mike the Pike,2008-08-17 23:07:00,3421,Hey folks I off to Northbay in the morning to visit my mom and will be doing a little fishing up in the great North.  Many of you Lakair folks know the slot size as well as myself because I did read the regs. now I know I have seen it before in the Ontario fishing regulations in previous years but can't seem to find this in the new book  So can some one tell me how the MNR wants me to properly measure a walleye.  Just in case I catch something and we know there is a good possibility that  junior will catch something.  MTP
240662,Guest skeeter99,2008-08-17 23:44:00,0,"it is pretty easy  from the tip of the walleyes nose and fork the tail to achieve the maximum length  the reg is actually 18.1 inches up north so there is some room  and if you kill your fish as soon as you catch them they will shrink(and I have seen this) up to a quarter of a inch  another tip if the fish is exactly dead on the slot, some conservation officers press in the mid section of the fish thus putting it out of the slot and a nice ticket for that, bujt most I have met up with in the bush are pretty good about it"
240681,Greencoachdog,2008-08-18 00:26:00,8163,"  Sorry Skeeter but you're mistaken, it's from the tip of the nose/mouth (mouth closed) to the tip of a pinched tail! Compress the tail with your thumb and forefinger and the very end of the tail will give you the legal length.  You'll find it here on p.8 under Size Limits  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/198219.pdf"
240686,Leecher,2008-08-18 00:35:00,7832,"Length of fish is from the tip of the nose to the fork of tail, not the tip end of tail.  Leechman"
240687,Greencoachdog,2008-08-18 00:38:00,8163, I wouldn't do that in Ontario if I was you.
240688,Grimace,2008-08-18 00:40:00,2020,I think it used to be the fork but they changed it to the tip.
240696,Leecher,2008-08-18 00:51:00,7832, Why not??  That is how we mesure the lake trout in Quebec....it's in the reg. Leechman
240698,Greencoachdog,2008-08-18 00:55:00,8163,"  Well I can't copy and paste from the PDF file, but if you'll click on the link in my post above and read on Page 8 under Size Limits you'll see why."
240699,Dondorfish,2008-08-18 00:58:00,1000,"Size Limits – All size limits refer to total length (includes those referring to Lake Sturgeon) which is a measure from the tip of the mouth with the jaws closed to the tip of the tail, with the tail fin lobes compressed to give the maximum possible length    From the regs! ( as per - GCD )  Don"
240701,Leecher,2008-08-18 01:01:00,7832," I read that clearly coach, but in Quebec it's at the fork of tail without compressing it....  Here is a pic from the reg of a waley  ""La longueur d'un poisson se mesure du bout du museau jusquâ€™à la fourche de la nageoire caudale. Pour la perchaude, on mesure la longueur totale du poisson.""  What this means is that only perch is measured to its full length...all other species is at the fork without compressing it."

240709,Greencoachdog,2008-08-18 01:11:00,8163, Nope!... Excuse me!!!... the last thing I wanna do is whizz of a Skeeter!!!  
240710,Greencoachdog,2008-08-18 01:13:00,8163, It's like y'all Franch guys have a different word for everything eh?     ... and y'all can't eat any of them because they're all poison???
240714,Leecher,2008-08-18 01:17:00,7832, I guess were just different  Sorry coach....what I meant to say is that by no means are we different....just rule wise....still love fishing
240727,danc,2008-08-18 02:13:00,4677,Make the fish as long as possible by compressing the tail lobes. That's the way I understand it.
240730,Roy,2008-08-18 02:26:00,13728,"Mike, just measure from the dorsal fin to the belly...you'll be fine."
240736,Mike the Pike,2008-08-18 02:36:00,3421, Now now Roy I know you do alot of girth measuring but no thats not what I need to know.  So is it to the fork of the tail in the middle of the V or to the very end of the upper tail .  
240737,Greencoachdog,2008-08-18 02:42:00,8163, Read the reg link in my post above ya Ninny!!!
240740,Roy,2008-08-18 02:48:00,13728,"I just read it. I think they measure it to the very end of the bottom of the upper tail. Not the lower tail, the one at the top of the picture."
240741,Greencoachdog,2008-08-18 02:51:00,8163,Ya gotta wonder aboot folks that post threads like this...  Are they really THAT ignorant... or just lazy???
240747,Mike the Pike,2008-08-18 03:48:00,3421,  I don't spik raid nehck I am  At one time Dog the MNR actually had the diagram and yes I like pictures and no I am not lazy
240775,Greencoachdog,2008-08-18 10:57:00,8163,"Ok, for those that can't comprehend the simple written description of how to measure a fish... here's a picture.    It's not a Walleye, but it works the same with all fish."
241041,Greencoachdog,2008-08-19 00:28:00,8163,"  You didn't ask for a diagram or picture in your original post Mike, you just wante someone to ""tell"" you. I ""told"" you exactly where you could find the information you wanted in the ONTARIO MNR REGS, and Tracker (Don) even spelled it out for you in black and white!  ... but you chose to ignore the correct info given to you and act ignorant with the post below.   How many years and how many times have you been fishing in Ontario???... and you still don't know the regs or how to navigate the MNR site to find the information you need?  Maybe you should get Ryan to read the regs and then explain them to you, that way at least one of the two of you will know what to do!   btw... it's is kind of customary to thank the person(s) that help you with information/answers to your questions on this board."
