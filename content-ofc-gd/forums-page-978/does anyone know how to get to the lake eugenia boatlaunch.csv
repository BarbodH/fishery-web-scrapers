240341,luvlunkers,2008-08-17 00:37:00,5,I planning a day trip to lake eugenia as i keep hearing it's full of buketheadsjust wondering if anyone has accurate directions to the actual boat launch?
240352,Spiel,2008-08-17 01:09:00,9065,....I'm not 100% certain but if memory serves me right it's located near the dam on the west side. According to a map I searched it's may be off Pellisier St. Which runs off Beaver Valley Road (Grey Rd. 13)
