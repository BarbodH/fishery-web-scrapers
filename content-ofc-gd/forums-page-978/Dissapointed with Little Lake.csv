240328,issamhay,2008-08-16 23:48:00,77,"I fished little lake today from 4 to 8 after hearing good news about it. The whole 4 hours I only caught 1 rock bass and everyone else I saw didn't catch a thing, something must have been messed up with the lake. Anyone have any experiences with little lake recently?"
240329,Greencoachdog,2008-08-17 00:08:00,8163,"I don't have experience with little lake, but I've been fishin' a time or 2. Your results for fishin' a lake for the first time are not surprising, and some days they just aren't biting. IMO you didn't fish enough hours to judge the lake, and you can't judge a lake by just one 1 day trip either."
240350,issamhay,2008-08-17 01:07:00,77,"Maybe its because there was just so much fishing pressure on that small  lake, there must have been around 25 boats."
240354,Rizzo,2008-08-17 01:15:00,4754,"I've only ice fished there with moderate success (average two pike in a morning). Actually, with all the pressure on that lake I'm shocked there's anything swimming in it."
240355,Wild,2008-08-17 01:16:00,704,Did you tie a hook onto your line first? Some fishermen may overlook certain details
240360,issamhay,2008-08-17 01:27:00,77,"i threw everything I had in my tackle box, i even used live bait."
240366,issamhay,2008-08-17 01:37:00,77,Oh and the weed growth was reallllly prolific there were weeds everywhere in the lake maybe that had something to do with it.
240373,Wild,2008-08-17 01:44:00,704,Yeah you simply picked the wrong lake then
240378,Rizzo,2008-08-17 02:05:00,4754,"could be the bluebird skies today too. I hear in the summer its not hard to get 10 pike a day(of the snotrocket variety) out of there. Keep at it, probably just the wrong day/time"
240397,Cudz,2008-08-17 02:45:00,2652,you have got to break through that heavy weed with heavy jig and pic.  You can also throw weedless frogs on the lily pads or run senkos over the pads.  Although that lake might have quite a few boats on it most people haven't got a clue what they are doing and catch a couple of little 'snot rockets'.  The fish are there they can be hard to find at times.
240414,FishingInTheDark,2008-08-17 03:14:00,25,"Ive definitly been fishing on Little Lake, and theres definitly fish out there! Something must have not been right. Try again! Haha. Lots of musky and bass."
240454,Rizzo,2008-08-17 11:37:00,4754, you either mean pike and bass or you have the wrong little lake!
240464,Garry2Rs,2008-08-17 12:24:00,1425,There is a Little Lake in downtown Peterborough.  It is part of the Otonabee River and has Musky and Bass.
240496,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-17 13:56:00,0,I've have many 40+ fish days on that lake. Its been a while though. Try using a small spinner bait or top water(Especially buzz baits) pounding shorelines in the morning and in the day?Find some deep water with no weeds(10-12 FOW) and cast a black grub or black worm and the fish will hit it before it even hits the ground.
240526,Bass Tard,2008-08-17 15:21:00,128,"Yeah, give it another shot.   I used to fish that place all the time with our ultra lights and a small of a spinner bait we could buy.  So easy to catch 50 fish in there in a day, just fish the shorelines."
240544,BillM,2008-08-17 16:24:00,17367,"  I think we are talking about the Little Lake right besides the 400 and across from RVH, not the lake attached to Gloucester Pool"
240552,misfish,2008-08-17 16:59:00,29133,"Any given weekend both rental places are rented out. That means there are around 20 tin boats and 15 poontoon boats.All boats are full of anglers.Do the math. As for the fishing,Cudz hit it.You got to break through the weeds and get down where the fish are. It was a great bass fishery,and still holds some good ones,but the fishing pressure 12 months of the year is heavy."
240568,e-z-out,2008-08-17 18:15:00,1052,  This was my lg on little lake yesterday doing some dock fishing it was a hard day with over 24 boats on the small lake. Still over all it was a fun outting.
240759,limeyangler,2008-08-18 04:21:00,5204,"I have had a similar experience on a lake called Bowden Lake, heard great things, went first time caught a few small ones, went second time with someone who fishes it regularly and caught a load. Agree with GCD...sometimes you get lucky fishing a new lake...sometimes it takes a while to unlock its secrets."
240860,Bass Tard,2008-08-18 16:02:00,128,"Thats not the little lake I'm talking about, I'm talking about the one near Tilllsonburg..."
