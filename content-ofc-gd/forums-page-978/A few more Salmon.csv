240575,Joey,2008-08-17 19:16:00,9122,"Headed down to Lake Ontario again today and went 3 for 4.  Got up before any normal human being should be awake (unless from the night before   ) and headed down under the moonlit sky.  I tried unsuccessfully to get a pic of the moon while in motion, but finally got one at the first set of lights off the highway.  Gotta love transformers in the moonlight    By the time we launched the sun was just rising and the geese were dancing.    I was first up from our last trip and caught this nice 27 incher.    Next up is Paul with a nice one, no measurement or weight.    This Hamilton Energy boat came pretty close to us, never seen them in that area before.    My turn again with another 27 incher.    Had one more on and off real fast.  The weather called for thunderstorms this aft and the wind seemed to pick up a bit after another hour of no fish so we called it a day.  These guys were getting ready to head out as we came in.  Wonder if they were looking for that little girl who fell into the Niagara River yesterday    This big ole plane was taking off past us on our way home.    It was a very nice day to be on the water this morning.  Not too hot or too cold and the fish cooperated.  Guess I'll make some more lures this afternoon.  Made this one last night.  I think I'm getting the hang of it      Cheers,  Joey"

240744,limeyangler,2008-08-18 03:12:00,5204,"Great report Joey. Love the picture of the geese, but especially lovin those salmon....pretty good days fishing by the look of it....sorry to hear about the poor girl falling in. Thats a cool looking spinner bait, bit of everything in that one, i just got back from winnipeg this evenin and went to the new Cabelas(formerly S.I.R) and picked up some spinner blades to make my own walleye spinners, much....much...much cheaper....and i can use flourocarbon line instead of the mono that comes on the pre made expensive ones. Once again, great report...ty for sharing."
