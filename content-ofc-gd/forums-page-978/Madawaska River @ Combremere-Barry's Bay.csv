239697,Reef Runner,2008-08-14 13:51:00,980,"Hello all,  Taking a camping trip to my old childhood summer stomping grounds on Wadsworth Lake near Barry's Bay at the end of the month.  As the quality of fishing on this lake has declined in recent years (btw mikeymike, how'd you do?), I was considering renting a boat for the day on the Madawaska River.  Preferably, I would like to rent a boat closer to Combremere as I'm more familiar with that stretch of river, plus renting a boat in Barry's Bay means facing the big water of Kaminiskeg in a small rental.  I recall renting from a Marina years back but cannot find a listing.  Any one know of an affordable and quality boat rental outfitter in the general area?  Thank you all who reply,  reefrunner"
239957,Another Canadian,2008-08-15 12:48:00,41,"Hi RR,  I spent many years up in Combermere when I was kid on our summer vacations.  Last time up there was Summer 05.  The marina I think you are referring to is Hydes Bay Marina, but I am not sure if they rent boats.  http://www.realontario.ca/listings/listing.asp?id=12314  There are some resorts around the area that might.  Hope this helps, AC"
239960,Reef Runner,2008-08-15 12:54:00,980,"Thanks AC, This is the place I rented from years ago, I can remeber the OMC delaer now that I looked at the link.  I'll give 'em a call.  I used to summer there annually as well.  Beautiful country up there!  Thanks again,  reefrunner"
240084,Dozer,2008-08-15 20:14:00,896,"You are gonna love fishing Kaszuby   Launch outta Lakeshore Dr. ( I think, the road running parallel to the Kamiskeg lake beach in Barry's Bay.  You will see the launch from the beach..  You will love the fishing there   Kasuzby lake is awesome too!"
240087,Reef Runner,2008-08-15 20:22:00,980,"Yep,  As you can tell, I'm of Polish heritage and absolutley love going to Kaszuby. Been there every year since I was a youngin with the family and hertcesze (sic?) (scouts).  Dziękują i zwarty linie (thanks and tight lines),  reefrunner"
240822,Reef Runner,2008-08-18 14:39:00,980,I've been calling Hydes Bay Marina but with no avail.  Tells me to check the number and call again.  Anybody pass by recently and know if they're still in operation?  Maybe number change?  realontario.ca posts it as (613) 756-1802
240879,Nemo,2008-08-18 17:14:00,727,I googled it.  Try this number  613-756-0576
240947,Reef Runner,2008-08-18 19:46:00,980,"Thanks Nemo.  Called another outfitter (Riverview) in Combremere, he wanted $150 a day not including fuel  I hope that's not the going rate for Hyde's Bay.  I might just be wading the Madawaska.  Thanks again."
240963,keram,2008-08-18 20:37:00,585,Call them about rentals http://www.chippawaresort.com/index.html. They are on the southern end of lake Kamaniskeg  powodzenia ( polamania kija)
240967,Reef Runner,2008-08-18 20:52:00,980,"I'll give 'em a ring tomorrow Keram, Dziękują for the suggestion.  Hyde's Bay doesnt rent anymore, nor sell fuel. Thanks anyway Nemo, it was the right number.  Changed thier name and tweaked the product.  Maybe it's the because of long weekend, or maybe the outfitters are just used to gouging us Polish, but man are rentals expensive around there.  Big thanks to those who replied, I hope to repay your kindness in fishing reports."
