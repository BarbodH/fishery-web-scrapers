I will only have my wading gear and will have both conventional and fly gear available. I was thinking the Nipigon River, Cyprus River or Jack Pine River. I am open to any other places as well as I have never been up that way and am nearly clueless as to where I should begin. Any help in finding some trout in the area between Sault Ste Marie and Dryden would be most appreciated. Thanks in advance  Bill"
240985,Musky or Specks,2008-08-18 21:35:00,2710,Like I said fish below Alexander Dam with spoons. Also go up to elizabeth lake rd and turn onto it. You'll cross a creek called fraser creek always good for tossing a spinner or some worms into it for some brookies particukarlyupstream of the road and under the plunge pool of the little falls/rapid. A little bit further down the road is Malvern Lake its chock full of stocker splakes and they seem to be very willing feeders. Hope that helps.
