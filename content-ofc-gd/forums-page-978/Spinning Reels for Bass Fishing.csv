240260,Popr,2008-08-16 18:06:00,7,"Hi Guys,  Just thought I would ask around concerning spinning reel for bass fishing (open water, sub-mergent weeds). I've been thinking about getting a new rod and reel. Any suggestions from the group on a good inexpensive spinning reels (less $150.00) looking at line weights between 6 and 14 lbs. Any thoughts on what you would purchase.  Thanks for your time....  Popr"

240265,BabyHerc,2008-08-16 18:26:00,285,"Ever since Daiwa stopped making the SS2, I despise all low to mid-range spinning reels.  This reel was incredibly solid and smooth, and had a very beneficial tapered-spool design to mitigate line memory and aide in distance casting.  I suppose there's a new Shimano reel in that price range that would be good.  If going Shimano, just grab the 2500 size in whatever price range you're looking at.  It's really a no-brainer."
240266,BabyHerc,2008-08-16 18:27:00,285," This ALMOST gets my vote, but it's still a little over-priced, but solid as a rock, and it lacks infinite anti-reverse."
240270,forrest,2008-08-16 18:29:00,1032," Dang, thats what I was going to say!  I have had mine for 20+ years and it is still great....I guess that means its an antique.  Daiwa must have improved with another model....but what?  forrest"
240272,Canuck2fan,2008-08-16 18:33:00,1444,Go get a Pflueger President reel in the size you want and then take the other 80.00 bucks out of your 150  and spend it on some other fishing toys. I haven't had any problems with my three which are all used YEAR ROUND for 3 yrs now or the two I have bought for my dad. Also your arms and wrists will thank you for getting something so smooth.  Just for fun I put 2300 yds of line on 6 spools the other night in a little over an hour and I can say that with my old Shimano Mark II's and symetres I would been crippled doing that much reeling in that amout of time. Never even had a twinge of discomfort with the President though.
240273,BabyHerc,2008-08-16 18:34:00,285," SS2 was lighter, had infinite anti-reverse, same gold/black colour, quick-fold handle, and tapered ABS spool.  More bearings if my memory serves me right, but I don't have the documentation to back that up."
240274,bassjnkie,2008-08-16 18:34:00,1101,"Daiwa tierra 2500, great reel, I use it with 6lb for match/float fishing for carp. 18lber on that reel, and never gives me a problem."
240315,PatrickGG,2008-08-16 22:36:00,562,Shimano Saros 2500F looks nice: http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0001000_100-1-2  Thats if you are a Shimano guy Quantums are pretty good also i have a Quantum Incyte which has been good to me so far.
240316,danbo,2008-08-16 22:41:00,2646,Daiwa Theory..  sweetness!
240320,lickmyarmpit,2008-08-16 23:15:00,359,"Love my quantum pti use it for everything from the eleven foot noodle rod to the ugly stick , to the ice rod.  No complaints from me on this reel drag is smooth and its a tough little reel im pretty hard on my gear and this one has taken quite a beating.  I would definately buy another and at 120 its a decent price."
240321,Greencoachdog,2008-08-16 23:15:00,8163,2 words...   Shimano Stradic!!!
240327,PatrickGG,2008-08-16 23:32:00,562,Same here i picked up the 2500FI and they are awesome smooth drag and dependable.
240423,Greencoachdog,2008-08-17 03:54:00,8163, So when are we gonna see some pics of these fish you catch on this Duh-Wa? tackle you keep braggin' on???  ... or is it the typical Duh-Wa? tackle syndrome? You can hook them... but can't get them to the boat!
240426,danbo,2008-08-17 04:02:00,2646,it's a long sad story..guess I could go smack some Smallies for ya!
240456,Greencoachdog,2008-08-17 11:47:00,8163, Slap those Smallies around HARD  ... and make them tell the TRUTH!!!  ... don't forget the camera!!!
240528,BeRad3000,2008-08-17 15:26:00,65,"I agree with Canuck2fan,  the president phfluger is great i picked up that reel in a combo at bass pro for taxes in 130 on sale the rod is a bass pro extreme 6'6"" .  Great combo!"
240605,holdfast,2008-08-17 21:42:00,1813," Excellent Reel, found one at a second hand store in Pembroke for 20 bucks along the Omnis and cheap Zebcos and Quantums.  Glad the owner wasnt a fisherman.  The spool would of costed more."
240639,Popr,2008-08-17 23:11:00,7,Hi Guys:  Thank you for your words of wisdom.  Popr
240721,jace,2008-08-18 01:42:00,472,  brought in a good amount of fish in the last few days.   4 of them were a good size including 2 coho's 10# and 14#  and a chum around 15-16#.  All  landed with a little bass setup.  100 size duhwa low profile baitcaster reel and a short gloomis rod.    I'm losing fish though because i can't get a good hook set with the rod...time to switch to a meat stick.
