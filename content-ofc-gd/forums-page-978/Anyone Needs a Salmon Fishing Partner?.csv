I'm new to open-water Salmon fishing, and I plan to start by learning from one of our fellow OFNers. If any has a spot on their boat, I would be more than glad to join and chip in for gas. I will travel west to Hamilton, east to Port Hope.  I have the Pleasure Craft Operator Card and I usually fish in-land lakes for Walleye and bass with a 18' boat.  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions and concerns.  - Will"
