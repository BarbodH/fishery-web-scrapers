240611,bbog,2008-08-17 22:01:00,665,For which model(s)? Would be a shame for someone on dial-up to find out at the end of the d/load that it's not for him...

Another real gem would be if someone posted the manuls that shipped with the units:  The Minn Kota website rates about a 3 out of 10:  -manual for my motor is not downloadable. -AMP rating/range for my motor is not downloadable. -easy side by side comparison of all the motors is not possible. -I actually have to do some digging to find the endura line (my motor). -Yeah I am complainng and whining, but, maybe someone else in charge of building some other website will not repeat Minn Kotas mistakes. forrest"
