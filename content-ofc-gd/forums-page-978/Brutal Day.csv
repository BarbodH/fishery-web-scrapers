240685,Rizzo,2008-08-18 00:32:00,4754,"thank you for all the replies. Son is great today, telling anyone who will list about the ""big hook stuck in mine weg"". The advice on the prop/spun hub as the likely source of the problems is also very much appreciated"
240864,SlowPoke,2008-08-18 16:07:00,2984,"Glad to hear the ""weg"" is doing fine! We've learned 2 things here today; A) When Dad says stay out of the boat, stay out of the boat. 2) Never let your bow line exceed the length of your boat.  -Brian"
240971,Rizzo,2008-08-18 21:05:00,4754,"Good summary Brian, both are excellent advice!"
240991,JPD,2008-08-18 21:59:00,296,Definitely a spun hub Rizzo... buy a new one and have the old one re hubbed and keep it as a spare... you should always carry a spare.
241005,gdelongchamp,2008-08-18 22:44:00,199,"Heh Rzzo, tough luck you had. Keep an eye on for infection though.  When guiding and doing first aid as I was in the middle of nowhere for ""you guessed it"" I had a nice little technique for imbedded hooks using a small piece of fishing line and two hands. Works very well. i will try and make a drawing and post it."
241007,gdelongchamp,2008-08-18 22:48:00,199,"As for your prop, you can start by removing the prop and checking for rope strands wound around the shaft. Build ups of old fishing line discarded improperly and left on the lake are also the cause of similar problems."
241010,JohnF,2008-08-18 22:58:00,3494," Achhhh!!!! Now you've made me sit on my hands. Dunno why, but it just feels more secure. Thanks......  JF"
241028,Rizzo,2008-08-18 23:53:00,4754," funny, that's exactly what I did today. Went to Royal Distributing and bought a new prop and hub that can be dropped into it. Then took the old one to Brentwood marine where they will send it away and get it re-hubbed. Funny thing is the remade one will probably cost just as much as the new prop/hub from Royal. Only reason I'm not just buying 2 new ones is I think my damaged prop is of a higher quality"
241080,ccmtcanada,2008-08-19 01:29:00,7971,"OUCH!!!  Sorry to hear about your son, but it sounds like he was a real trooper about it all.  Nothing is worse for a parent then seeing your kids in pain like that!  Then the motor thing....wow...when it rains it pours eh?   Hopefully it's a inexpensive fix for you.  Better luck the next time!!!"
240472,dharapiak66,2008-08-17 12:45:00,6,"you have to question the saying"" a bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work"" on that one . that""s pretty bad. hope you're little guy is ok. i got a treble hook from a wally diver stuck in my thumb once when a 4 ib pike started flopping in my boat while i was trying to release him. same thing, barb was buried could't yank it out. had to drive 2 hours to pickle lake to the nearest clinic. after a few needles to freeze my thumb they got it out. i laugh about it now, i wasn't at the time."
240478,bigcreekdad,2008-08-17 13:08:00,546,"Sounds like you burned out the nub in the prop. They can actually be repaired. I've done the same thing twice, and one reason why I always carry a spare prop. Other reasons include when you run over that shoal the somene moved since the last time you were there."
240482,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-17 13:25:00,0,Lures are dangerous and should be kept well out of reach of pets and children. Good to hear that the damage was very minor. I'm not sure if tetnus(sp?) shots are needed??  The motor problems sounds minor too. Same thing happened to me on a rental boat when I hit a chain and it coiled around the prop. You should be up and running in no time.
240515,mepps,2008-08-17 14:41:00,1301,"Ouch Riz, thats a rough day!"
240557,ehg,2008-08-17 17:24:00,2666,Good thing your young son (and you) got through that. That is brutal sounding.
240565,Wild,2008-08-17 18:11:00,704,Kids can take it no problem well unless yur hooked in the wiener
