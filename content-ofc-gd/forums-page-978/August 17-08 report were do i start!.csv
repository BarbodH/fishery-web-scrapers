240670,Joey,2008-08-17 23:55:00,9122,"Oh man, that's gotta bite.  Burn your fingers AND lose your gear - ouch!!!  Sorry to hear that man.  Nice smallies otherwise.  Joey"

240679,bpsbassman,2008-08-18 00:17:00,941,"Is that first pic the last picture ever taken of that rod??  :o If so, I'd be pretty upset too."

240823,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-18 14:41:00,0,Some nice smallies. Sucks about your rod though. We've all been there in one way or another.
