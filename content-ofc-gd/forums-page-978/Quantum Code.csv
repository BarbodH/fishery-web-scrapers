241033,PatrickGG,2008-08-19 00:04:00,562,"I still have my lefty up for sale, i am looking at the smaller Baitcasters they are lighter and easier to manage the the only set back is pulling in power but i would sacrifice that option for lighter gear."
241043,danbo,2008-08-19 00:31:00,2646,I recommend the new Daiwa HSTA 153 it's got it all!  http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/descpageRLCDAIWA-TDACA.html
