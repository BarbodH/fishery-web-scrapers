239210,punjabiyaar,2008-08-13 02:49:00,7,"Hi guys,  I am pretty new to fishing well never done it actually  Can somebody tell me some good spots in GTA and what baits/lures should be used, obviously dont want to come home empty handed first time.  thanks in advance for your help."
239219,tdotfisherman,2008-08-13 03:09:00,317,"http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/STEL02_163569.pdf - This link should help.. It lists a number of spots, and fish you can expect to be there.. go out and experiment, do some legwork, and see what's there..  As far as lures, go to your local Canadian Tire, to the fishing section, and try a few different lures.. buy a few crankbaits, jerkbaits, and spinnerbaits, and give them all a try.. The worst thing that happens is you have a great day out fishing, and working on your technique..  And if your a complete rookie to fishing, I suggest reading a few books on the topic, and watching a few Saturday morning fishing shows, to get a little more familiar w/ things"
239242,StrealHeader,2008-08-13 04:49:00,56,If your interested in just the fish I say you save your time and go buy them in a grocery store.
239490,bbog,2008-08-13 20:34:00,665,You might want to consider hooking up with a like-minded board member willing to show you the ropes. Failing that a few hooks and some worms should get you started.  Good luck.
239605,ehg,2008-08-14 02:48:00,2666,"I would try just dew worms , hook, sinker, as mentioned. Rouge Park at the east end of Lawrence has easy access or fork out a little cash for a trout pond like Burd's.  Good Luck, ehg"
239792,ozaibak1,2008-08-14 20:54:00,401,"I would suggest definately going out with someone who has fished before, you will catch more fish and learn a lot quicker than teaching yourself."
239840,punjabiyaar,2008-08-14 23:33:00,7,  I would love to go with one is there anybody ready to help me out ??  Thanks
239843,timmeh,2008-08-14 23:37:00,609,"If you've never fished before make sure you have an ontario fishing license and are familiar with the fishing regulations. You need to be aware that many types of fish have closed seasons when you cannot fish for them (you're pretty safe now but in the fall many fishing seasons start to close). Also some water bodies have different rules on what you can fish for, you can't keep everything you catch. It may seem like a lot but you need to know this stuff before you start fishing.  Any tackle store in your area can get you set up with a license and a copy of the regulations.  Don't fish in toronto so can't help you out there.  good luck"
239861,mepps,2008-08-15 00:24:00,1301,Toronto Islands is a great place to fish.
239920,sharper,2008-08-15 03:39:00,279,Try any of the parks along lake ontario
239971,snag,2008-08-15 13:50:00,1932,    What they said!  Good luck!
239989,marvin,2008-08-15 15:05:00,37,Toronto Islands are a great spot to fish. I fish there all the time. I usually go there in the boat but have went from shore from time to time.
240892,punjabiyaar,2008-08-18 17:49:00,7,"Thanks Guys  I went to Toronto High park yesterday, however could not catch anything coz i had only Rapala lures and fish were very small and biting only worms.  I saw people catching fish and it was fun."
240902,Wild,2008-08-18 18:04:00,704,So then why not ask another for a worm and hook? I am sure they would have given you one. Or search for a worm
240912,punjabiyaar,2008-08-18 18:33:00,7," I did ask for it, but they did not had any spares. I saw a woman who was fishing with a rod and two reels (without rods) and i saw her a couple of time going into water probably fishing with bare hands. I wished her good luck"
240920,highdrifter,2008-08-18 18:46:00,2534, There are no fish at the Toronto Islands..
