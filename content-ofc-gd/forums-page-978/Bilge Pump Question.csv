As such I can't speak to whther the problem below just started or has been like this the whole time.  Yesterday I was looking for leaks in my boat so I filled it up with a hose.  Didn't find leaks, but when the auto bilge came on, I notice that the pump was pumping out water, but just barely.  Water was litterally just trickling out of the outlet and running down the back of the boat.  I am used to water coming out almost like a hose and ""shooting"" out of the outlet, just from what i have seen with other boats.  When I feel the hose, it feels like there is water in it, but it just doesn't seem to want to flow out the hole.  Does this mean the capacity on the bilge pump is too low and I need a larger pump?  Not sure what the specs are on the one that is in there now.  FYI - boat is 18'."
240235,cranks bait,2008-08-16 15:16:00,721,You could have the intake blocked or a blocked hose.  It could also be a weak pump.  I had a 450 that I put in last fall and it barely trickled out.  I now have a 750 in there and it is like a race horse.

240280,John Bacon,2008-08-16 19:03:00,3277,"The fist thing that I would check is to look for debrie in the intake.  I have a lot of trees' around my dock so I have constantly having to removed twiggs, etc., from the bilge pimps intake."
240284,Greencoachdog,2008-08-16 19:23:00,8163,"Yes, you may want to clean your bilge...   I've found the best way to do this is to leave the drain plug out while launching"
240296,Pinch,2008-08-16 20:37:00,231, Yes I found out that this works very well!!!
240336,nancur373,2008-08-17 00:20:00,1211,Don't have a bilge but found out it is a great way to wash the bottom of the boat. Also found ou tthe first time I launched my boat that the trailer lights aren't waterproof and the don'tike water when plugged in...
