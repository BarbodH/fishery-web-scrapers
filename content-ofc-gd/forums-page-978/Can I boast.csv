239772,Radnine,2008-08-14 19:33:00,1538,"[quote Quitting the smokes is a different story. After a few days the physical addiction calms down. The biggest problem, at least for me, was the association of cigarettes with every aspect of my lifestyle. Pick up the phone (light a cigarette), get in the car (light a cigarette), have a beer (light a cigarette), pour a coffee....................well, you get the idea. Change your daily habits and it will be easier.   While I agree that there is a perception of association between smoking and these activities, I think that being able to quit lies in the realization that it is just a perception. Ask yourself how the all of the people who don’t smoke do these things everyday. You will quickly see how silly it is to think that they can’t be done without a smoke. The only activity that does need to change is hanging out in the smoking area. You will quickly find that without the smokes, you have substantially less in common with the sidewalk dwellers. I think that attaching negative images to smoking will make it easier to quit, or in the same vein, attaching positive images (i.e.: my clothes stink if I smoke/how great I smell if I don’t smoke) I quit 14 years ago (personally, the logic of the patch system worked for me, slapped it on and never had a craving, still haven’t). And when you do quit remember that the minute you quit, you are a non-smoker, not a smoker taking a break or cutting down. And don’t ever fall into the “I just have a cigar on the golf course” trap, you will be fooling yourself. Clearly you are into self-improvement, good luck, and nice job on the weight loss."
239776,misfish,2008-08-14 19:46:00,29133,"Thanks all. I will be working on the smoking thing. If I could just get the mrs,s to cut down to,it would be alot easier.  Hey Brian,Awesome drop in the waist line. Are you sure it,s the waist,or is the hind end thats shrunk. L M A O   Just dont have your wife around when they say,your looking good. If you know what I mean.   Maybe we could start an OFC BIGGEST LOSER"

239779,Disspatcher,2008-08-14 20:02:00,73,"Congrats on the weight loss! One tough climb for sure..as far as the smokes goes....the patch,nicorette ect..none of these work cause they all have nicotine in them!!  Mark my words...read this book..honestly, I know it sounds like an infomercial but it worked for me and ALL but 1 person I have told to try it..5 so far! its called ""The Easy Way To Stop Smoking"" by Allen Carr He tells you to smoke while you read it  The challenge..buy a fresh pack of butts,and start reading...betcha you not only finish the book; but you quit smoking before the pack is done! Feel great to throw away 7 bucks worth of smokes! Worked for me..been 2 yrs now!  Now if I can only get that twinkie outta my mouth."
