Immodium Gravol Tylenol Painkillers Polysporin After-Bite ( for the weaker kind on the trip  ) Sore throat lozenges Claritin Povidine-Iodine wipes Tums...

240595,douG,2008-08-17 20:30:00,2693,"Take some Benadryl for those weird allergic reactions, even good for the regular ones like poison ivy.  Some cortisone cream can be handy too.  I also take baby wipes for the outhouse, helps to keep you minty fresh."
240596,fishing n autograph,2008-08-17 20:32:00,2540,immodium for those emergency situations!

240734,Dozer,2008-08-18 02:32:00,896,"Okay, thanks for the input everyone.  I'm so stoked, going up to the French River for 3 days for a quick canoe trip"
240844,douG,2008-08-18 15:31:00,2693,"Have a great trip, Dozer, and hope you don't have to crack open that first aid kit!"
240853,wallyboss,2008-08-18 15:51:00,1095,Most places tghat sell safety supplies will carry some Burn gel. (like somebody else mentioned)  especially if camping. Some are good to 2nd degree burns.   cause toothpaste or butter just doesn't cut it.
240857,Headhunter,2008-08-18 15:57:00,5703,"Learned this first hand last week, although not a first aid thing, bring an extra can opener! Oh my, talk about frustrating, trying to open a can of food and having an opener that gave up the farm years ago can get pretty annoying! HH"
240989,Pinch,2008-08-18 21:52:00,231,"There's this stuff for diaper rash called Sudocrem.  It is awesome for all sorts of cuts, burns, scratches, grazes etc.  Ive got 4 kids and that stuff is a god send.  Here's a link  Sudocrem"
240990,sturgman,2008-08-18 21:59:00,249,"  My sentiments exactly!! If you are careful enough while out in the bush, you shouldnt need too much other than Jack Daniels as others have mentioned.."
241006,Raf,2008-08-18 22:47:00,3495,Krazy Glue - works in place of stitches.
241016,Roy,2008-08-18 23:36:00,13728,I was JUST about to post about Crazy Glue! It's the best stuff to use in very cold weather when your hands and fingers have a tendency to split and crack.
