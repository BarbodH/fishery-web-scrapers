240649,linweir,2008-08-17 23:33:00,202,I need to replace starter for my merc motor. Anyone can tell me where to buy a good price starter in GTA? Used or rebuilding one is fine as long as it's in good working order. Price is so high from Mercur marine.
240652,HTHM,2008-08-17 23:35:00,4082,In hamilton area I would suggest Maximum Marine or J & J Marine.
240655,Guest skeeter99,2008-08-17 23:37:00,0,just take it to a starter altenator shop and have it rebuilt might cost $60 or less all starters are the same internally they will set you up
240729,sonny,2008-08-18 02:22:00,511,"Any reputable starter or alternator rebuilder should be able to take care of it for you,,,just look in the yellow pages,,,around the hamilton area i would only use ""black brothers"",,,they just did my fathers alternator on his sailboat for 100 bucks,,,good deal considering it was a rare breed!"
240742,Zamboni,2008-08-18 02:54:00,235,Worth asking as merc had a bad batch with an easy fix-starter spinning without throwing the bendix up into the flywheel?
