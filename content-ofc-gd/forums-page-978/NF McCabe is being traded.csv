239979,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-15 14:20:00,0,"Hopefully they stop concentrating on offense and get some defensive men that can actually hold the fort. All we need is 2 good point shooters for the power plays. The rest should be defense oriented and support the goaltender. We have to keep the shots on net and the goals against, down.  We need at least one very big defense man like Churla that will take care of rebounds or anyone touching them."

240090,jediangler,2008-08-15 20:30:00,1923,"All the leaf fans are excited, wait till the news comes out that in order to take McCabe the Panthers want their first round pick next year as well. With the leafs finishing in the bottom 5 teams for sure, there goes their chances for Tavaras.  Win, Laugh, Win"
240095,lickmyarmpit,2008-08-15 20:46:00,359,Ahh toronto the only place in canada where the leafs fall in the spring!!!  
240096,ozaibak1,2008-08-15 20:52:00,401,"I don't know why ppl have hope for the Leafs, it doesn't matter which players get traded. It starts by changing up the MANAGEMENT from the top down. The management of this organization/business is great if talking only in terms of profits, in terms of pride respect or winning hockey team it is the absolute worst. A definition of insanity is doing the same thing over again and expect different results. I for one don't expect the leafs to make the playoffs again, I don't know what to think of ppl who do... (see previous sentence)."
240099,steve_paul,2008-08-15 21:05:00,658,I personally would love to see him traded to the Wings.  If only to see Stoty's reaction

240125,Cookslav,2008-08-15 22:35:00,1457,Only a Couple more infections to remove and we can let the healing begin...
240128,misfish,2008-08-15 22:37:00,29133,I will mishim. Sorry I like the guy.
240135,danbo,2008-08-15 22:58:00,2646,Ya lucky for me I was alive in 1967.. I doubt I'll be alive to see them hoist the Cup again!   
240139,Roy,2008-08-15 23:20:00,13728,"August and hockey talk, wonderful. Gunna be a long winter. Who cares who gets traded to whom? Can any of us change it? I think not. Just keep paying for your seats, paraphernalia, and Pay-per-View. and everyone will be happy."
240249,Cookslav,2008-08-16 16:38:00,1457,Now Tell us how you really feel Roy
240610,holdfast,2008-08-17 21:58:00,1813,"Maybe Mtl will pick him up to replace BriseBois ( AKA Brokenwood).  Oops, hes not French or European."
240764,bassmaster4,2008-08-18 07:17:00,801,i actually like mccabe but dont mind seeing him go as i guess that is part of the rebuilding process and he seems to have his good season behind him
