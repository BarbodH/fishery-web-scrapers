240672,Leecher,2008-08-17 23:57:00,7832,"Guys,  Yesterday, the plan was for my friend Paul and I to hit one of the local lake for bass action.  The weather was beautiful but somewhat cool early morning and decided we'd leave around 9:30am.  Got to the lake around 10:15am, launch the boat and headed for our favorite spot.  I know that yesterday was the full moon and expected the fishing to be slow but to our surprises got quite a handfull of both SMB's & LMB's.....  Started working around the many islands that the lake has and produce results right of the bat..... I started with a white BigO and hooked this little darling.....not a big one..... but decent....Here is a hand shot of it    Then Paul with his white Spinner Bait got this one..... an 18"" LMB..... very decent fish and gave him a good fight.    Here is Paul with another one, on a bass rat....    We moved to another a spot and Paul wanted to try the thick stuff and got this wopper..... 18"" and change LMB    While he was working the pads..... got this one on the BigO....    And again got this one....a hand shot....    We moved to another spot and I change to a Spinner Bait and right away hooked this baby    And this one....    Paul kept using his bass rat and working the outside edge of cat tales and again.... hook on this baby....    We kept fishing different spots and got a few, here and there but nothing huge.... As daylight diminished..... we headed for a flat.... tied on a jitter bug and got into a frenzy..... Caught one that was smaller than my lure....about 5"" long.  Caught a ton of these.... here a hand shot...    Then Paul gets this 18"" beast....    And I get this decent one...    We used a different variety of lures and the preferred ones were: Bassrat, BigO, SpinnerBait, Jitterbug, Hoola Popers and Gulp.  Was a wonderful time spent on the water Until the next time Leechman"

240712,Leecher,2008-08-18 01:15:00,7832,Thanks coach.....my pb is a 4.0Lbs LMB that I caught last year in that lake....guess I have some work to do LM
240722,Joey,2008-08-18 01:44:00,9122,"Wow, nice Bass  Looks like a very productive day.  I always thought fish were more active when the moon is full.  Joey"
240725,Leecher,2008-08-18 02:04:00,7832," Thanks Joey.....There's an old saying that ""3 days before full moon and 3 days after"" fish are on the feed.  It sure was a good day but nothing like we experience in the past..... the lake is unfished and bass, when active, you get one after the other.  LM"
