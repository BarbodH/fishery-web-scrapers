Lorne Greene, who ran the Canadian operation, was the only one there.  He said they are now shut down, all the girls who built the rods are gone, and that all warranty work was now being handled through Shimano in Peterborough. Shimano bought Loomis about a dozen years ago, but they continued to operate as two separate companies. Garry2R's"
