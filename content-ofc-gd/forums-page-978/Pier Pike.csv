Me and a few buddies went down to the pier for the first time this season to try our luck on some pike. The first one is me, only my second pike EVER! Not very big but still my pb (i plan on changing that very soon)  All and all we got five that day, i want to share the rest of the pics but it looks like that first pic took up all the room, i guess i still need some help. Once i get this down pat you will be seeing alot more of me. IM HOOKED!"
