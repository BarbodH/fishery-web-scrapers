It is still way better than my Old f150 was.  And Brian, if you don't think you need her permission, she is doing a better job than you think..."
869160,Rustic-Fisher,2014-08-25 00:02:00,826,"Brian, I'd love to share the RAM nightmare I had with Barrie Chrysler LOL. I loved my Ram Mega Cab until this year , when detailing it in the spring I discovered fist sized rotten spots on both Rockers, rust starting to show on the rear wheel wells , and front end suspension repairs that were endless. Truck had 130000 km and was NEVER worked yet basically fell apart at 125000km. Truck was bought and Dealer maintained at Barrie Chrysler and I'm still waiting to hear back from a. Chrysler manager in regards to providing me with information on how a 60000$ truck that's six years old can rot so quickly, I was supposed to hear back 2 months ago LOL, gotta say I really love my 2014 Nissan Titan Pro 4x !!!!!! I could rant for hours about this LOL ."
869161,Terry,2014-08-25 00:09:00,14456,well that's centennial / Barrie Chrysler  I couldn't even get them to show me a truck I wanted to buy ...they just were not interested so I drove to another dealer and bought one...might be the worst of the worst
869171,Joeytier,2014-08-25 01:25:00,3990,"I imagine I'll be around there after the lift and tires are installed.  I'm going to look into picking up a tuner as well.  Ryan, those Pro 4x Titans are awesome.  I was considering one but decided I didn't want to give up the long bed/ext cab which I dont think nissan even makes"
869202,hutch4113,2014-08-25 12:34:00,374,"Same experience at Barrie Chrysler.  Sales guys argued with me on every option I wanted.  Then told me the Diesel was not available in Canada - which then changed to it was going to be limited numbers.  When I told him that 8000 had already been ordered/built (this was back in march), he kinda just stammered some other pointless ideas.  I had sent them 3 build sheets - with exactly what I wanted.  They would not give me a quote unless I signed something - what I have no idea.  At any rate, I gave them a chance, but bought somewhere else.  I am all for supporting local business too - > but the local business has to be worth supporting.  Got the truck I wanted for almost 20K off the sticker.  So  - if you are looking, do your research, get your prices and shop around.  Unfortunately just not in Barrie.  (To be fair I have had the same experience at every dealer I have been too in Barrie - that's why my last 4 vehicles were purchased elsewhere)."
869236,kenzy31,2014-08-25 14:52:00,261,Just get an AWD van. Covers all the bases. We brought in 2 field dressed bucks to the butcher in my dad's Caravan with a tarp down. I didn't want blood in the back of my F150! lol j/k Our next vehicle will be a van to replace my '96 Civic hatchback. Not too practical with 2 kids and 2 dogs lol

Yes there are many bonus factors to having a truck,but I get along just fine as you all have seen.  I have no boat to tow or a place to keep it. But I have a float aboat that fits in nice,along with anything I need for a days fishing.  This is why I have the, Mopar buddy..Great millage 60 bux to fill (when fuel is $1;30) and lasts a full two weeks.  I get to fish from Barrie to any lake near Gravenhurst..  No this is not a garage sale,this is my traveling tackle box.  Some days,I just get in and drive and I never know where or what,Im going to be fishing for. It,s an awesome feeling..      Repacked  for another outing.  No Terry,that is not your flipper.    And just so were all clear here,I dont leave my keys in it. And it is well insured.. LOL"

You can buy a lot of toys for the difference between your current wheels and that beast in your sights ( although it sure would be nice, and then you would have the power to pull a nice 16 or 18 footer with the truck. Just sayin'........ )"

I only hunt with silhouettes for geese, and I can even fit 6-8 dozen silhouettes and 2 layout blinds in my SUV.  Having the truck is nice, but it sucks paying the gas bill!"

869055,bushart,2014-08-24 11:15:00,2628,I was going to stay away from this as everyone has a diff opinion when it comes to vehicles  Anyway....this is what I ended up doing  My 4 door f150 is gone---it was a great truck but as everyone knows----at $1.30---your looking at $170 to fill from empty  I had 3 criteria on my search....4wd...tow a boat....good gas mileage  Now I had a truck but I ran around with the box empty 363 days of the year  Many small suv's don't have the tow capacity but can get the other 2 criteria  So This is what I got-----ford escape---2 litre eco-boost---3500 lb towing capacity---4wd------great on gas  I have a utility trailer if I need a dump/lumber yard run (smartest thing I ever bought)  An Ottawa run would cost me 100 dollars round trip------now just did one for 40
