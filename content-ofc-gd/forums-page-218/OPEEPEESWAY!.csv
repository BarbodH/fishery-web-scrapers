Curious about:  -species in it ('eyes, whites, pike, is what I researched so far.. also cws and pseed - I guess that's all, really - surprised no yellow perch...) -clarity/colour of the water - does it blow out easy, are some areas dirtier than others (no lame jokes please) -average depth from an anglers perspective, as well as how deep does she get -cover, structure, bottom substrates -hazards -any lines on good maps -reports of previous successful trips around this time of the year -anything that will help me pattern the lake  Cheers!!"

869628,chris.brock,2014-08-27 01:22:00,4053,"not really a pike lake IMO, this time of year, look deeper (15' to 30') using your sonar to find the eyes then jig them off the bottom, try the shallows in low light  basically a typical Chapleau area lake"
869655,Muskieman,2014-08-27 11:14:00,2472,"Water color is very tannin stained , Walleye and Pike are everywhere , from 2' to 35' , average depth we caught them in was 8-12' , my friends went up last weekend and caught over 400 .. any pattern will work , it's a no brainer lake .. although the big Pike are sparse , there are nice Perch in the river .... North End of the lake / River is easily accessible by car , but you will need a truck to launch the boat ."
