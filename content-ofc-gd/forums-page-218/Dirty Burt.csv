869226,blaque,2014-08-25 14:21:00,2419,"I remember back in my teens, the creek bed was full of old saw blades from a mill at the top of the creek......long since rusted away, but still a sign of the lack of concern for the area. Depending how seriously folks take this news, (Again......not a huge surprise).........this may be the death of Burt/Newfane/Olcott"
869228,BillM,2014-08-25 14:23:00,17367,"I can't believe people would need a warning not to eat those fish anyhow.  Half dead being brought up on ropes, lol.  They are Zalmons!"
869250,blaque,2014-08-25 16:01:00,2419,"I can't believe people would need a warning not to eat those fish anyhow.  Half dead being brought up on ropes, lol.   Exactly.......i never have and never will understand it. Some of it is people who have traveled from Ohio/Pa/Michigan......etc etc, trying to get their ""Gas money worth"" of fish meat. Some of it is low income locals that see it as meat on the table. Some of it is braggin rights when they come home to show the neighbors. Who knows.  Im really interested to see how this shakes out this season now that there is an official open report on it that has been introduced by the media  The details of the story seem to focus on an area upstream from the dam, in the thin sections of the creek probably 10 miles upstream from the circus.......that may have people thinking its OK toward the mouth?? Well see  Do you plan to come down still for the brown run lol ??"
869251,BillM,2014-08-25 16:05:00,17367,"I always come down that way for the brown run, it's like an annual pilgrimage"
869277,blaque,2014-08-25 19:32:00,2419,make sure to take some dirt with ya.........free glow sticks for all those Toronto rave parties  !!!
869280,BillM,2014-08-25 20:05:00,17367,"If the roe glows in the dark, we might be onto something!"
869348,Salmonidstalker,2014-08-26 00:01:00,265,"What can you really expect from a river that is damned 2 miles from the lake where thousands of fish sit and wait to get absolutely DESTROYED and MASACRED!!!!  Oh it's a scene, man.  I'm guessing some group knew about this a long time ago and now the $hit storm is about to hit."
869513,blaque,2014-08-26 17:18:00,2419,"If the roe glows in the dark, we might be onto something!  ya man, now ur talkin"
868727,blaque,2014-08-21 20:00:00,2419,"This shouldnt come as a shock to anyone, Especially Niagara County  Those of you who travel or have traveled south of the border for the salmon circus,  may be interested in this.........5 families are in process of being relocated due to the contamination upstream  http://wivb.com/2014/08/20/warning-issued-over-contaminated-creek/  This.... coupled with the fact that Oak Orchard is rumored to be fenced off at the waterport dam.......should keep lots of snaggers on the couch this year. (although i doubt it)"
868776,misfish,2014-08-22 10:13:00,29133,Never been there. Have watched many sickening videos on you tube though. You maybe right though. Doubt it will stop many from snagging away. Fill yer boots guys.  Bon App√©tit.
868788,jbailey,2014-08-22 12:02:00,866,they need an outfall monitoring program.
868790,BillM,2014-08-22 12:06:00,17367,I like the salmons!!!!!
868816,blaque,2014-08-22 14:44:00,2419,is boy? (sorry....think only the locals would get this lol)
868829,BillM,2014-08-22 16:41:00,17367,Burt is definitely an experience.
868839,Salmonidstalker,2014-08-22 18:01:00,265,"I think deep down, every steel header has good times at the dump. They just don't care to admit it.  It's good for one thing, but it does offer up a few good laughs, sometimes a little inappropriate behaviour leading to some fines, and always leaves me wanting to come back to the circus."
868840,BillM,2014-08-22 18:07:00,17367,"It's definitely a fun time..  Going there you just can't help but laugh..  guys ganking giant chinnies in the back screaming FISH ON, tangling everyone up and then obviously losing the fish.   So much lead getting tossed around you should be wearing body armour.   I go there after the salmon madness for the brown gold."
868844,Salmonidstalker,2014-08-22 19:03:00,265,"Don't forget, this is the same water that flows into Lake Ontario.  And people wonder why some are hesitant to eat fish from the lake. We are the last lake on the Great Lakes chain, the bottom of the barrel.  I'll never eat fish from Lake O."

868853,Burtess,2014-08-22 20:03:00,901,Now take some of those comments and change the context....  Now you are talking about me.....  A little bit disturbing lol...  Burt
868854,Steve,2014-08-22 20:03:00,2075,burt...  isn't that the brown raping hole?
868884,Salmonidstalker,2014-08-22 23:02:00,265,It's the original rape hole for everything. Brown trout included. All put and take so any thing that gets bonked doesn't bother me one bit.
868885,misfish,2014-08-22 23:09:00,29133,"It's the original rape hole for everything. Brown trout included. All put and take so any thing that gets bonked doesn't bother me one bit.   So all ethics, are put aside there ? LOL"
868886,Salmonidstalker,2014-08-22 23:13:00,265,"Ethics and an opinion on a put and take fishery are two different things. I do not condone snagging, and I am perfectly fine with the harvesting of fish where a put and take fishery exists....if that answers your question."
868887,BillM,2014-08-22 23:19:00,17367,"  So all ethics, are put aside there ? LOL  I'll catch all my fish legally, but I'm keeping 3 fat brown hens everytime I go.    You remember that chinook roe I gave you?  Wanna guess where that was from?  The dirty Burt!  lol!!"
868888,misfish,2014-08-22 23:20:00,29133,"Ya,that was written on the bag Bill.LOL  It was the best roe I have fished with.LOL   TY Just asking. J"
868890,BillM,2014-08-22 23:24:00,17367,LOL!  If I get some more it's all yours.
868913,misfish,2014-08-23 08:41:00,29133,"LOL!  If I get some more it's all yours.   I still have no passport. Would love to pop some corn and pull up a chair . I like circus,s."
868928,Steve,2014-08-23 14:53:00,2075,"In the voice of Snidley, you know if the use of roe wasn't legal then .......  ahh, nevermind"
869010,BillM,2014-08-23 23:25:00,17367,"In the voice of Snidley, you know if the use of roe wasn't legal then .......  ahh, nevermind  LOL!!!!!!!!!"

869118,Steve,2014-08-24 17:58:00,2075,voice of Paul from the grave.   :)
869197,blaque,2014-08-25 12:00:00,2419,"So now, on top of the 2 bucks to park.......there will be a 3 dollar contamination clean up booth you'll be required to walk thru at the top of the hill before you exit the premises. Im not sure its worth the 5 bucks to fish anymore??"
869199,BillM,2014-08-25 12:19:00,17367,I bet if you lit a match that entire place would be engulfed in flames.
