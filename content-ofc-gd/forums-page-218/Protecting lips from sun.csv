869229,mike rousseau,2014-08-25 14:37:00,4661,Hello everyone...  I was wondering what products people use to protect their lips from sun damage...  Generally peaking the rest of my body is ok with any sun block... I currently use blistex with SPF 30 but it doesn't seam to work well...  I just did 25 hours fishing in 2 days with a bluebird sky both days and my bottom lip is slightly swollen and sore to the touch...  This has happened before.  Let me know what you've found that does the trick please...  Thanks  Mike
869234,Fish4Eyes,2014-08-25 14:47:00,1022,Are you reapplying the blistex every few hours? Having a bite to eat or something to drink will smear it off as well and you should reapply directly after.
869235,fishnsled,2014-08-25 14:49:00,3520,"Just have to be constantly reapplying it as we are licking our lips, drinking, eating and thus removing it without even thinking about it."
869237,AKRISONER,2014-08-25 14:53:00,5558,"  Australians use zinc oxide, Thats my buddy off the coast of queensland. Ya it makes you have white lips but its the best way to protect yourself.  Down there this stuff is a 100% necessity as the sun will destroy you after an afternoon out on the water.  Put it this way, i never wear sun screen ever in Ontario. The most i get is a mild burn at the very begining of the season and from then on never burn peel or anything.  Down there I walked for 15 minutes without a shirt or sunscreen on and got the worst burn of my life."
869240,mepps,2014-08-25 14:58:00,1301,"Get a Buff! I wear them all the time, it will protect your whole face and neck from the sun. The material is breathable and will even keep the mosquitoes away."
869241,BillM,2014-08-25 14:59:00,17367,"I use the Buff as well, works great..   Not hot even on the warmest of days."
869245,mike rousseau,2014-08-25 15:14:00,4661,I have a buff but find it's warm unless there's a good wind... My sunglasses fog up... Etc... I really do try to use it as much as I can... At the very least it's around my neck to protect that   The zink might do it....
869252,wallyboss,2014-08-25 16:10:00,1095,"I keep my buff wet and it sure helps with it being warm.  My glasses used to fog up when I breathed out thru my mouth, I've started breathing out thru the nose and it seems to keep them clear."
869253,BillM,2014-08-25 16:19:00,17367,"I also don't pull my hat way down when I fish, seems to relieve my glasses from being fogged up as well."
869258,AKRISONER,2014-08-25 17:01:00,5558,"a wet buff would actually feel awesome on a hot day, this might be a great idea."
869325,moxie,2014-08-25 22:28:00,1566,"I use the Buff as well, works great..   Not hot even on the warmest of days. x2.... If it does get a tad warm, take it off dunk it in water and throw it back on."
869330,misfish,2014-08-25 22:53:00,29133,"Or you can just wear a hat,glasses and grow a stash. LOL    "
869331,TDunn,2014-08-25 22:54:00,680,Buff x3
869370,mike rousseau,2014-08-26 00:54:00,4661,Guess I'll have to get used to my buff from the sounds of it...  Got some umbrell lip balm with titanium dioxide which apparently is good from what I've been reading...
869389,SuperDave,2014-08-26 02:06:00,204,"Any lip balm with SPF should work. reapplying is the key. This sounds funny but my lips are super sensitive to the sun and without blistex with SPF I won't even venture out. I also wear a buff. I have lip balm everywhere. Truck, boat, raincoat pocket etc. Never go without. And reapply often!!"
