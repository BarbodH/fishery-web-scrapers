Okay, flip the bail over, and just keep paying out line until the loop goes up the guides. Meanwhile I'm drifting out into deeper water. Okay, there goes the loop, flip the bail back and start reeli... WHOA NELLY! This feels big. Vibration on the line, definitely not a snag. Up she comes, and it was a beautiful 24"" lake trout, first I've ever caught. Didn't intend on playing it that long, but my net had got tangled up in other stuff on the floor of the canoe, took me a while to get it free with one hand.  Lake trout are off limits in George Lake, so I just grabbed a quick measurement so that the park staff would have some more data for their files. Jamieson Dyer, Park Warden, was quite pleased to find out that they're apparently healthy, but smaller ones would be of even more interest, as that would be a better indicator of successful breeding.  Anyhow, enjoy the video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o6K4HWfsts"
