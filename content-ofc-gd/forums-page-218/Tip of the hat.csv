My wife and I are most often bass fishing as we took a charter a couple of years ago and have at least some idea what we're doing.  Would love to expand our repertoire and catch the big ones!  Who wouldn't??  Most of what I ever catch is with the old worm and bobber rig but I'm learning to use my other tackle to some effect.  Finally caught a decent catfish out of Hamilton harbor the other day on a spoon but my phone died before I could take a pic.  I work nights at a men's shelter downtown and am free to go fish around 7am most days.  If any more experienced shore fishermen would like to hook up and share some tricks that would be awesome.   Otherwise I'm enjoying following the forum's here and finding some great advice.  Would love to find some fishing fellowship in the area!!  Thanks all, look forward to finding some new fishing friends!!    "
