869221,kickingfrog,2014-08-25 13:59:00,8333,"Today at 10:30am TSN will have 5 channels up and running. For Bell they will be 1400, 1401, 1402, 1403 and 1404. Who wouldn't want 4 channels all showing the same tennis match?  http://www.bellmediapr.ca/Network/TSN/Press/TSNs-Five-National-Feeds-Launch-Today-Giving-Fans-More-Sports-More-Choice-and-MoreTSN-Than-Ever-Before"
869224,BillM,2014-08-25 14:02:00,17367,"Saw those channels listed about a week ago, I'm guessing this will be similar to the SportsNet channels."
869274,Governator,2014-08-25 18:37:00,879,They should be more concerned with what they are going to put on their original TSN channel this winter than adding 3 more.
869282,kickingfrog,2014-08-25 20:09:00,8333,They still have NHL games.
869284,BillM,2014-08-25 20:10:00,17367,26 games between Toronto and Ottawa I think?  At least that's what I thought I heard.
869285,davey buoy,2014-08-25 20:12:00,5505,"26 games between Toronto and Ottawa I think?  At least that's what I thought I heard. That's just nasty if true,isn't there a few more teams in the league?"
869290,BillM,2014-08-25 20:20:00,17367,"That's just nasty if true,isn't there a few more teams in the league?  no no, between as in... 26 games with either Toronto or Ottawa in them, lol.  Can you imagine poor MuskyMatt dealing with that?  26 games of hell, especially if they were Ottawa home games!  :)"
869291,kickingfrog,2014-08-25 20:22:00,8333,I'm not sure about the other teams out west but the Jets also have a deal with TSN.
869292,davey buoy,2014-08-25 20:23:00,5505," no no, between as in... 26 games with either Toronto or Ottawa in them, lol.  Can you imagine poor MuskyMatt dealing with that?  26 games of hell, especially if they were Ottawa home games!  :) Got ya,but I don't really like Ottawa,wouldn't mind a couple Mtl games thrown in to break it up.Just sayin.Sorry Matt,lol."
869293,Governator,2014-08-25 20:29:00,879,"TSN only has broadcast rights for regional games for some Canadian teams.  Those new TSN channels are just so they can broadcast regionally.   In other words if you're in Toronto I don't think you'll be watching the Canadiens on TSN, it'll be blacked out on one of their channels."

Kinda like PK alot,I think given a bit more time,he will be one of the best.I guess we will still see the mtl/Ottawa games,Toronto/mtl games as well.Thanks for the clarification."

869317,i2cool2fool,2014-08-25 21:59:00,349,"Meh. NHL and NHLPA can suck a pickled egg IMO. I am not ready to go back to watching hockey yet.  But for those who enjoy watching the game, hopefully you will get more options rather than a bunch of channels airing the same game."
