869168,Rod Caster,2014-08-25 01:13:00,5784,"We finally hooked up with Dana for a camping trip this summer. Abby is only 3 months old and this was the first time we took her in the canoe/camping, and Caius (Dana's boy) is not quite 2yrs old, so we opted for an easy-access lake with nice campsites. Dana suggested Anima-Nipissing. It was a great choice for this kind of trip.  We left home a foggy moring, mist rising over my fancy cross-rail system.      Abby in her first PFD. We laughed! She was stiff as a board in that thing which made it easier to carry that squirmy kid.    Dana and I put in lots of time looking for lakers. No such luck. The walleye we nowhere to be found either. A few bass and we called it a night.    The kids did quite well. I think Caius' favorite parts were throwing stones into the lake and swimming.        My two girls slept as I snuck out for some lakers...again no luck....jeeeezz                  That was that for our short trip with the kids. Good times and more to come!!"
869169,BillM,2014-08-25 01:15:00,17367,That looks like a killer campsite!
869172,Joeytier,2014-08-25 01:28:00,3990,Damn looks like a great spot!  I already told you to stop using topwaters for lake trout!!
869182,chris.brock,2014-08-25 02:30:00,4053,"that's good, get them started early  I think BPS has mossy oak baby clothes instead of that pink, frilly stuff  good balance of family/ outdoors stuff Chad"
869186,adolson,2014-08-25 03:51:00,783,"Looks like you got much nicer pics than I did, but here's a few more anyhow.  The first night, something was desperately trying to get onto our island... Looks like a bear was hungry for a midnight people-burritos-on-a-platter-in-the-middle-of-the-lake snack. Luckily, the algae was super slippery and we scared it away, only to find the evidence the next morning.    Caius playing with some ""toys.""    Caius and Abby - actually looking at Chad, but I liked the picture.    And a couple pics I took with my phone.       We all had fun, even though we couldn't get any trout. Thanks for coming out!"
869243,Musky or Specks,2014-08-25 15:03:00,2710,Great to see a couple of young families out enjoying the area. Dana great to see your keeping the weight off.
869267,JoshS,2014-08-25 17:55:00,729,Cool.. 3 months and camping! Good on ya. Looks like an awesome spot!
869269,can u fish,2014-08-25 18:13:00,326,Nice to see a young family enjoying the outdoors thanks for the report and the photos.  Cheers...
869352,spincast,2014-08-26 00:07:00,3279,looks  like a great time. How'd those no-see-ums like you this time Chad?
869380,Rod Caster,2014-08-26 01:36:00,5784,"looks  like a great time. How'd those no-see-ums like you this time Chad? Man, this year has been horrible for me! They say you develop immunity, but I've seen no such thing  happening. This trip however, the burning midges weren't so bad."
869465,Ralph Field,2014-08-26 13:52:00,1018,Looks like a nice place to camp and enjoy a great holiday with the family.
869486,LucG,2014-08-26 15:11:00,779,"What a perfect campsite, and even nicer scenic shots! Too bad the fish didn't cooperate, although luckily looks like the weather did!"
869504,fishnsled,2014-08-26 16:28:00,3520,Looks like a fantastic place!  Too bad the fishing wasn't better but it looks like the family time more than made up for it.  Nice report!
869512,Joey,2014-08-26 17:04:00,9122,Well that sure looked like a great trip.  Beautiful family!!!   Those scratches on the rocks are kinda eerie though
869516,mistyriver1,2014-08-26 17:32:00,600,Great pictures !!!  What a beauty place.   Thanks for sharing.
