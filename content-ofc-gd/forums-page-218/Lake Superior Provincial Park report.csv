869545,onthemountain,2014-08-26 20:07:00,9,"Just got back from a few days of camping on the lake in LSPP. I had a really great time and would highly recommend this park, especially the hike-in sites and the canoe-in sites. The campsites are spectacular- many have their own private sandy beaches and all have amazing views.  I really like rocky beaches so I canoed to a site that had one and set up camp. Looking at the map I also figured it might be close to some good fishing spots:   Getting ready to head out fishing in the canoe:   I spent a while casting different spoons and spinners along the shoreline until I found a great spot with a bunch of submerged trees next to deep water. First catch was a 12"" brook trout, caught on a 2"" silver and red Williams Wabler:   In the same spot I also caught an 18"" lake trout, also on the red and silver Wabler:   After returning to camp, I had a great panoramic view of the sunset:   If any of you guys have the chance to go to LSPP, I'd recommend also checking out the Coastal Trail while you're there. I did a day hike to some very scenic lookouts, and wish I could have spent more time on the beach along the shore. Next time I'd spend more time there for sure and camp a few days at a hike-in site. It would be pretty easy to take the canoe to some of the sites closest to the access point, but I have no idea if the fishing would be any good there. Here's what it looked like:   Cheers!"

The beaches really set it apart from other places like Killarney. And you're right about it never being crowded- I saw practically nobody else there the entire time, even with perfect weather.

869579,Joeytier,2014-08-26 21:36:00,3990,I spent 4 nights camping in the park in early March 2013.  It's a pretty spectacular corner of the world in the winter
869589,onthemountain,2014-08-26 21:58:00,9,"I spent 4 nights camping in the park in early March 2013. It's a pretty spectacular corner of the world in the winter  That sounds amazing. Were you in an RV? I went winter camping for the first time in February this year at Killarney, but stayed in one of their heated yurts. They have a few groomed ski trails there but I found it more fun to go snowshoeing and explore wherever I wanted. I'd like to do more winter camping, maybe even someplace you can also do ice fishing."
869591,Joeytier,2014-08-26 22:04:00,3990,An RV?? Lol!  I was in a tent
869598,onthemountain,2014-08-26 22:15:00,9,"Lol, sorry if that was a silly question. I'm a noob when it comes to winter camping. I have a 3-season tent and it starts getting too cold in October. I'd definitely have to upgrade a lot of gear."
869613,spincast,2014-08-26 23:26:00,3279,"nice report and some beauty shots. LSPP is one of the most spectacular pieces of scenery in Ontario. Amazing waters, and canoe in campsites.  Brings back some great memories"

869688,Dara,2014-08-27 18:15:00,3052,This could turn into a heck of a hijack  I drove by there last week and you wouldn't believe the roads they are punching through virgin forest to get to the top of all the hills around there...with transport trucks and 600 ton cranes.   Heck of a way to save the environment while at the same time closing roads so we can't access our favorite lakes
