869151,HTHM,2014-08-24 23:20:00,4082,"Here is a random thought, How about a reasoned, moderate discourse on what the actual issues are that allow certain members of our society to have lax enforcement of certain laws. Or to put it another way deal with the situation as it is, not as it should be. I'll start: Perhaps it could be a jurisdictional issue?"
869154,Spanky80,2014-08-24 23:38:00,152,"I think maybe we have been too harsh on the ""native"" community.  Perhaps we could pour some more money into the Indian Act, or perhaps we could give them some more land, or maybe if we fund their college/university for them, or maybe we can give them rights to harvest so-called renewable resources so they can feed themselves and we'll turn a blind eye so they can maybe sell it to support themselves.  I bet if we do that we will certainly make up for the unfairness from the past.  Surely they would be very pleased with our kindness and not rely on this handout...I mean, surely we wouldn't be creating a welfare state where we are expected to give and give and give...surely we wouldn't be held responsible if the reserves have a higher level of poverty and lawlessness, would we?  I mean, we do our best to turn a blind eye and let things go from an enforcement point of view so as not to alienate them.  Surely they wouldn't blockade highways from law-abiding tax-paying citizens and terrorize their communities, would they?  Good lord, surely we didn't create these problems from our own kindness, did we?  I mean, they wouldn't be expecting MORE from us, would they?  Gawd no...say it ain't so"

I got side swiped in downtown TO a few years ago, then went on a 3 or 4 minute car chase until I boxed the kid in. Rich kid in his Dad's BMW. It was fun driving like I stole it.  for now, I'm gone Squatchin'"

869320,outllaw,2014-08-25 22:10:00,1232,I wonder is insurance more money near a reserve???
869324,Gerritt,2014-08-25 22:27:00,6129,"You bet it is. Which is why insurance companies want you postal code and the method in which it Is parked.... Garage, driveway etc"
869405,pics,2014-08-26 04:12:00,1268,"The native approach to justice is a little different than what we are used to. The 6 nations police face a lot of community pressure if they arrest certain people who have connections. You just don't make waves when you don't have to.. their ideas about justice focus more on forgiveness and healing than on actual punishment itself. We may not like it but it won't change. Most residents know where the chop shops are and who does the crimes but why would they snitch? It would make their life miserable.. Since reserve land can't be owned and land is granted to members by the band, they are apt to ignore ""petty"" crime around them because moving isn't an option... The policing around Caledonia was a joke when the town was held hostage. Gunshots at night, home invasions, atvs on the streets at all hours and never any arrests..."
869597,pics,2014-08-26 22:12:00,1268,sadly two young men from the reserve died last night in a car accident in Caledonia. They were speeding in a stolen truck and blew through a stop sign hitting a transport truck....
869686,davew3,2014-08-27 17:57:00,430,Yes  sad about the two.  Very foggy lately.  They do have a good network though.  The SUV was reported missing from the east coast.
869693,jimmer,2014-08-27 18:38:00,2730,"Will the insurance company even cover it if the keys were left in the atv? Not sure? It's depressing to read about activities like this, because it only leads to more distance/tension between various groups."

869716,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-27 21:26:00,8243,"That's somewhat harsh Bill. I believe in Karma as well, but Karma doesn't take 2 young lives for a piece of crap stolen vehicle. Both men in their 20's have family members that are very highly respected in our community. One of the firefighters that had to extricate the 2 that were dead on the scene as well as the survivor said they couldn't tell what body part was for what kid. That's not Karma.  I saw the rubber on the road from the tractor trailer yesterday. It went uphill for a few hundred feet, that trucker had to be flying to do that pushing a 1/2 ton truck. Those trucks fly at that time of night, I call it no mans land. OPP want nothing to do with it and the rex cops aren't on 6. My wife is forbidden to drive that stretch at night. No one that doesn't live here can understand the tension around Caledonia and Hagersville at times. Now the town council have announced approval for a 3500 unit residential survey on prime farmland a mile north of the river on McKlung road. Here we go again."
869728,leaf4,2014-08-27 22:12:00,2466,"I'm gonna have to agree with Bill on that one, you reap what you sow and I very much doubt this was their first rodeo when it comes to stolen vehicles, back to the beginning of this thread the perp was referred to as a kid, it's not just a select few it's a way of life for a large majority, these may be broad strokes but it's not untrue. karma will get you"
869732,Joeytier,2014-08-27 22:19:00,3990,All this karma rubbish is enough to make me puke.  I guess the loving father of 3 that was killed on hwy 11 yesterday was a victim of karma too.
869734,outllaw,2014-08-27 22:22:00,1232,sad deal no one deserves that death. just irresponsible kids met a sad ending.
869743,Spanky80,2014-08-27 23:11:00,152,"I agree with Bill as well, that truck was bought and paid for by a working person trying to get by the best they can, instead they'll be offered a small amount less a deductible for their troubles.  Their taxes go to support these ""natives"" as well...  They are more than irresponsible kids, they are thieves and crooks.  Probably didn't deserve to die, but probably shouldn't be in a stolen vehicle participating in what sounds like a large theft ring either.  Karma, like Mother Nature, can be a bugger."

869761,Gerritt,2014-08-28 02:07:00,6129,"I have lived in caledonia, I have seen first hand the lawlessness that occurs there. The OPP does nothing, the native police do nothing, the government does nothing. They do what they want how they want.  Put the six nations reserve in your backyard.... And those that are standing up for them might be singing a different tune..... Unless of course your a contractor who was just doing his job at a construction site nearby only to have his face beaten in where he is no longer recognizable...  All for doing his job.  Or a elementary school put on lock down because of gun fire...  Highways shutdown down because the keepers of our land were burning tires in the middle of them...  I'm sorry but the so called natives of canada have earned this reputation by their own accord, by their own actions.  So long as there is a reserve system the natives will never be part of main stream society... It's impossible.  G"

He grabs his car keys, runs outside, and chases the kid for a couple miles, he's got video shot through his front window, running stop signs etc  The kid turns into a field on the reserve, pumps the middle finger up and down a few times, then rides away  Scotland Ontario, near 6 Nations  2012 Kodiak 450, EPS, camo  it's insured but still $1000 deductible, and 85% of value, reserve and regular cops don't really care  the moral of the story, don't leave your keys in your bike down here"

868687,chris.brock,2014-08-21 15:35:00,4053,I'm going to try to post the video here
868692,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-21 15:57:00,8243,"Chris, If bro has lived in Haldimand Norfolk long enough I'm surprised he would even think of leaving the keys in any vehicle. We know many, many who have lost there vehicles locked or not. My wife's co worker had her Dodge Ram stolen from a Shoppers parking lot in broad daylight. The call to the OPP resulted in her just making a report over the phone. They laughed when she asked what they were going to do to find it. Unless he buys it back he will never see it again, video or no video, sad really.  When we are away I actually hide the spare keys in my locked home. And I have to say it isn't always those stealing that are from the reserve, often it is locals and end up on the reserve where there is a market for hot vehicles. It's a daily occurrence here."
868699,Gerritt,2014-08-21 16:31:00,6129,Having lived right next to the reserve.... I am certainly not surprised. That said your BIL made it easy by leaving the keys in the bike. Most crimes are of opportunity.... Which this was.  G
868708,Rod Caster,2014-08-21 17:44:00,5784,Your BiL is better off just giving up and claiming insurance. You wouldn't want that bike back now... won't be in good shape.
868710,Musky or Specks,2014-08-21 18:07:00,2710,I guy I work with just had his tricked out Ram stolen right out of his driveway and he's petty sure it went to the chop shop on the reserve.l He would have chased after them but his mom was worried about violence but he knows who the driver of the second car was he just can't prove itt.
868711,AKRISONER,2014-08-21 18:12:00,5558,"had a convo with an OPP officer in the area just a couple of weeks ago. She said that you can easily catch these guys doing all sorts of illegal stuff, but will you ever get anywhere with actually making an attempt to make an arrest? Nope...  Cops cant even get onto the reserve when people are wanted for serious crimes, never mind recovering an ATV.  File the insurance claim"
868744,pics,2014-08-21 22:28:00,1268,It can be a lawless place out there. I had a truck stolen and recovered on the edge of the reserve..burned out of course.. The only place in Canada where you can carry a loaded firearm and shoot from a vehicle and get away with it. The police out there know where the chop shops are but it's too risky to bust them up.

868777,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-22 10:45:00,8243,"For serious crimes the OPP go onto the rez regularly in concert with Six Nations Police. The story really isn't funny. What was BIL going to do if he caught the guy? I know what we would all like to do. My luck the kid would be a member of one of many MMA clubs out here. 30 years ago, no problem, today I'd have to call 911 and be done with it."
