869561,Fisherpete,2014-08-26 20:43:00,1814,"Nice king! Lake O makes it almost too easy to get them, it means a lot more to get one on GBay. I took a salmon charter there years ago and all we caught was a bunch of 4-5lb bows.  I have the same socks without socks tan just not quite that dramatic LOL  Pete"
869563,davey buoy,2014-08-26 20:49:00,5505,"I grew up on G-Bay till I was 21.Can be tough at times foresure.My late grandfather was persistent and not many days we would not come back without a whitie,steelhead or laker.Back then the commercial fisherman were slaying them bigtime.Nets right outside the front of our house.1/2 mile out."
869568,BillM,2014-08-26 21:08:00,17367,   Open water king fishing in GBay isn't exactly a slammer.  I'm guessing that's what he was referring to.
