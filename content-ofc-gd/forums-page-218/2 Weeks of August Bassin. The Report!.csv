869188,Reel Man,2014-08-25 08:29:00,80,"Wow, great stuff Mike!  Looks like some great camping and killer bass fishery!!  Still looking for my honey hole.  Have lots of fun and consistent fishing at the small lake where we cottage near Huntsville but no beasts like those!  Gives us something to aim for!  lol"
869192,MCTFisher9120,2014-08-25 11:15:00,3761,We caught a bunch of those high 3lb with several in the low to mid 4lb range. It's amazing how big some of them look but in reality your looking at a 3lb 11oz fish when in reality guys say they are 4lbr's blah blah we have seen it and heard it. I weigh the first few to get my bearings straight then don't bother unless I know it's over 4lb's then I'll check and see.
869193,MCTFisher9120,2014-08-25 11:19:00,3761,"You are definitely using all high impact lures.  Great choices.  Good skill 3.5"" TexasRig-Jigs..I like flipping jigs but find you have to work to hard to get them through the slop and the slop loves to attach its self to jigs…I throw the plastic, keeps my bait in the water 2x as long and works awesome. Get a good Swimbait, I'm spoiled so I throw the swinging hammer with the big tail, vs the skinny dipper with the tight wiggle this bait is better for bringing fish out of cover…they can feel it more. Small poppers, you don't need megabass but the results are always awesome when throwing the high end hard baits, and jerk baits…you could fish a tube all day but I saved it for the cold front conditions…I like rip baits, didn't get a small smallmouth all trip, good 2 1/2+ bite on those with the biggest getting caught on it. Froggin…you do catch 1lb largies in certain spots but when you frog high potential cover you will always be rewarded…bass eat frogs don't care if it's september or june they are in the cover and munching.  Hope this helps"
869260,glenner,2014-08-25 17:28:00,56,"Man, what an awesome collection of hawgs! I used to fish for Bass almost exclusively but over the years gradually changed to now fishing for Walleye almost all the time. After reading your report and seeing those pictures I decided I have to start getting after Bass again! Great read and great pictures to boot!"
869271,JoshS,2014-08-25 18:17:00,729,Great work out there. I don't bass fish much anymore but it's nice to stayed tuned and get insight on what's working. Solid report!
867967,MCTFisher9120,2014-08-17 02:07:00,3761,"Hello everybody here on OFC, it's mid August once again and I just got back tonight from 2 fantastic weeks of fishing a few hours north east of here on my favourite lakes. We showed up on the first Saturday in August and had awesome weather until this past Wednesday. We had 25-30degree days and full sun with little cloud. It was hot at times but I fish hard from 5am on the water until 6 or 7pm at night. I take breaks and bring out either my Dad, Brother or Uncle once a day sometimes twice depending how tired they get but I'm doing what I enjoy and it doesn't tire me out it seems.  Here we go starting with the first bass of the trip lot's of these bass were caught on a variety of baits. My success for largemouth primarily came on 3 things, the PTL swim bait and 3.5"" TRJ that I've sworn by for the last 3 or 4 years, the froggy's by Snag Proof and last Megabass poppers and jerk baits. I finally got into smallmouth action this year on some tubes jerk baits and top waters in the early and late parts of the day.  Day 1, we arrived by noon and got on the water for 5pm after setting up camp the first day, awesome little place near the lakes edge.  Here was #1 of the trip working some deeper weed while moving towards the slop.   Day two started out well, got up early as normal and worked a big clump of pads on the small lake, got this one a few ounces under 4lbs   Later in the day I went out after breakfast working a upper part of a stretch I had success in the previous season. Paid off with this nice big largemouth just under 5lbs   The afternoon produced some smaller bass but this one was enough for me. Next day was when the big largemouth of the trip showed up, hit the nickel mark. What a awesome largemouth bass!   Not to much later this one popped the froggy!   Next day was slow as the temps rose, I got this nice little chunky bass on the popper early on. Got them around this size all day with most in the 1.5-2lb range. I then wanted to search for smallmouth with the new equipment I picked up, throwing straight 10lb fluoro on the 6'8, didn't loose a fish all trip and picked my times to throw the arrangement of baits. Worked well   First smallie on the jerk bait in August, had to try something else and it escalated into a bunch of nice fish!   And another quick one on the jerk bait.   Went down to the boat for a half hour after dinner went down to the boat throwing topwater ad got a nice bass.  Had dad come down and take a pic while I tested my live well I ran for 2 or 3 mornings worked well.   Morning once again got this big smallie out deep on a tube outside of camp.   This morning I took my uncle out for a 3 or 4 hours, we did smallmouth for the first hour and I got 3 culled one as I wanted just 4 in the well for the morning for a picture, the aerator and pump made those fish so hard to grab the handful of ice and constant change of water was key. We got 5 that morning 3 to my credit and 2 to his. Was a blast!   Was frogging all afternoon and got the big smallmouth bass of the trip out off the deep rock, wind was blowing right and the fish was there…can't wait to get a fish finder in the boat next year, forgot it at home but made due just fine   And the fight of my life was on, there nuts the jerk bait and fish jumped 4 feet out of the lake boat side then so many head shakes above water I thought I had a heart attack haha   Next morning I nailed my first good swim bait fish, gave me all the confidence I needed to stick with it some days.   My 2 for the morning, good one on topwater and the swim bait. Was a happy man haha.   Dad with his first good one of the trip, was quick on the trolling motor and net when the fish was on pumped for him.   I got him by a pound or so  Nice one flipping the cover behind the frog.   Later my uncle got onto a nice largemouth    Got the popper out the love the small baits sometimes!   She was chunky(same fish)   Later on, big largemouth.   Flippin the cover, I like the 3/4oz tungsten for this stuff always and 22lb fluorocarbon   Big one of the following day for me.   My uncle once again with a dandy largemouth. They fight hard when they use the heavy spinning gear.   Smallmouth action, they fight so hard. 3.5"" FoodChain Tube on 12lb braid   Frogging a big pad bed only bite in the bay but worth the half hour pass through before breakfast [/url   Yes I fished in the downpours most of the day when the cold front hit haha   Haha my uncle with a Pike, first fish on a bait caster…there getting better   Taking a break it was awful but better than sitting in a tent complaining   Big Pike   Nice smallmouth on the tube, made the day for me   Dad with a nice bucket in the rain later on after the boys switched up and I stuck it out.   Weather was ok the next day, here was a largemouth in the afternoon slow morning all small ones.   Yes not a Black Blue Red Flake craw like always, tried the Green Pumpkin Purple Flake and it got me 2 nice bites, this one in 3-6ft deep fast current and rocks.   He liked it too, great fight made that day end right!   Last morning, Friday it was. Good one in the cold brrr was 10 or 12 degrees wasn't impressed waking up  O well had a job to do, fishin time.   Dad with one later on Friday morning   And I got the last one of the trip. Was a blast and what a crazy weather change we went through. O well had fun and can't wait to get back.     Putting my foot up on the dock post on the last night…Take a break guys, it's well worth it you only live once.  Thanks for looking and reading, good fishin!  MTBF"
