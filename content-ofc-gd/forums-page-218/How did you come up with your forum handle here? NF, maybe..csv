868142,muddler,2014-08-18 12:25:00,623,First fly I ever used for brook trout on the west branch of the Spanish River was a muddler minnow. First fly I made while fly tying was a muddler. First fly that caught a fish that I made was a muddler. Since them I've muddled(pun intended) around with fishing stuff for over 55 tears.  Build my own rods for over 45 years now. Tie all my own flies and make my own furled leader. Made worm harnesses and poured my own plastics and jigs for over 40 years. Passing all my stuff to my son and daughter-both avid fishermen. Figure I'll muddle along with more stuff in the future.

We played 18 that morning - another 18 that afternoon (man was I sore).  Then the organizer took us to a Par 3 called Tupelo Bay - for another 9.  I complained the entire round, hit the ball like garbage (I have back issues, so I was hurting pretty bad, by that point).  One of the guys in the foursome (we ended up becoming good friends) started calling me Tupelo Bay - then Tupelo - and it has since morphed to just Tupe.  (He also hit a hole in one at Tupleo Bay that night....I was up next and shanked my shot into the Mall parking lot that was beside the golf course - I think that is when the nickname thought entered his mind).  So when I am around those guys - I am Tupelo.  Figured why not and went with it."
