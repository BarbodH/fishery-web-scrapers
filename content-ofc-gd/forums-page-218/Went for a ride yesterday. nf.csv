869349,Bernie,2014-08-26 00:03:00,3190,"Some of you may know Dennis Johnston. He operates Ice Bungalows here on Nipissing.Known Dennis for a good many years and he is a great guy.Last winter he stopped by the cottage for a warm up and a chat. Said sometime during the summer he would fly by and take me up in his Cessna 180.Well, he did that yesterday. He buzzed the cottage to see if I was here. Like usual, I was. Up we went. It's been a good many years since I was up in a small craft. Exhilarating experience!We flew for about a half hour over the South Bay. Never realized there was so many ponds and small lakes before.He gave me a few pointers and let me take the controls. It doesn't take much input to change altitude or direction. I'd love to get my pilots license, but too many other things to look after at the same time. Life is too short! Didn't see a lot of boats out on the water.Anyway, here are a couple of pics I took.  Hunters Bay    Most of South Bay area. You can see the Manitou Islands and the North shore in the distance.    Fish Bay    This is the mouth of the South River.   Me at the control. Dennis seemed to be calm during this lol"
