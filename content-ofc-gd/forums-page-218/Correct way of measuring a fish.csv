869977,Terry,2014-08-29 13:18:00,14456,"some areas you can't keep fish in the slot, so if you don't pinch the tail you would be breaking the law.......  either way I pinch the tail and if it's even close I let it go"
869979,G.mech,2014-08-29 13:41:00,830,"The question is do you measure on the contour of the fish which will always be larger than on the horizontal plane. Measure it horizontally without touching the fish, I recommend not pinching the tail for a slot limit fish, this I believe is not clear in the regs. The regs and all legislature are written in order to keep millions of Canadian lawyers in business.  It is perfectly clear in the regs and has already been posted by another member that you are to pinch the tail.....not sure where the confusion comes in.  If you don't pinch the tail to measure a fish just under the slot size you're gonna get yourself in trouble.  As for the contour, they measure with a flat board so either use a ruler or pull the tape tight, do not follow the contour.   From ""The"" book  To find the length of a fish:   Cut and pasted from Page 8 of the current regs:  Size Limits  – All size limits refer to total length which is a measure from the tip of the mouth with the jaws closed to the tip of the tail, with the tail fin lobes compressed to give the maximum possible length."
869792,LostAnotherOne,2014-08-28 13:11:00,956,Hey guys.  Just wondering what is the official and correct way to measure a fish.  Does the measuring tape go on the side of the fish and have it not touching it while its laying on the floor or do you put the measuring tape on top on the fish and hold one end at its mouth and the other at its tail.  I think the correct way is to put the tape measure to the side of the fish.  Thanks
869794,Dara,2014-08-28 13:14:00,3052,The correct way is the way the CO does it to get you for that 1/8 of an inch.  Don't even think about keeping anything close to the line
869797,BillM,2014-08-28 13:45:00,17367,I put the tape over the fish from nose to tail.
869798,Court R,2014-08-28 14:01:00,213,Don't forget to pinch the tail too.

869803,Terry,2014-08-28 15:05:00,14456,"I thought by the subject line you were going to tell me the correct way  but mitch seguin gave the answer, thanks"
869804,Rod Caster,2014-08-28 15:08:00,5784,Extend your arms out until your shoulders hurt....measure that distance and stick to your story!
869805,crappieperchhunter,2014-08-28 15:29:00,2582,Extend your arms out until your shoulders hurt....measure that distance and stick to your story! Thx for the grin
869806,LostAnotherOne,2014-08-28 15:32:00,956,Thanks guys for the info.  My only wonder is if you place the measuring tape over the fish and its fat then you would get maybe an extra inch as opposed to placing the tape just right beside it.  Anyways I'm adding 1 extra inch to every one of my fish lol
869810,Sinker,2014-08-28 15:45:00,8692,Best way is with a bump board. East to make one.  S.
869815,captpierre,2014-08-28 16:25:00,2521,I asked the CO at the fishing show because of the walleye slot on the Kawarthas.  To pinch or not to pinch the tail  He thought my question was laughable.  Told him I don't want a fine over the 1/2 difference  Can be used either way at both ends of the slot  Never did answer me
869817,Musky or Specks,2014-08-28 16:38:00,2710,Best way is with a bump board. East to make one.  S. This is the answer.
869821,mike rousseau,2014-08-28 17:00:00,4661,"For legal reasons I understand pinched tail...  My grandpa told me back in the day they didn't tail pinch when he was measuring musky... Scary to think he has some upper 50"" fish without pinching..."
869822,Craigson,2014-08-28 17:02:00,117,Id say lay the tape flat and put fish on top to measure. That way the tape stays flat
869823,Dara,2014-08-28 17:08:00,3052,"A lodge owner up near Wawa told me a story last year.  He had a bunch of German tourists staying a week with some other relatives from Ontario.  Kinda of a family reunion thing.  Half a dozen people staying a week.  They all bought fishing licences for a week or 7 days or whatever it is.  They go out and catch 3 walleye and are so proud...even though we know walleyes in that area are a dime a dozen.  They measured all the fish to be sure of being legal  CO shows up and shows them how to actually measure fish...see, squeeze the tail like this...and this fish here is a quarter inch too long to be legal...thatt'l be $250.00 please  Good thing they didn't have a ripped life jacket or they would really hate visiting Canada  Any CO worth his salt can make any fish grow a quarter inch"
869825,mike rousseau,2014-08-28 17:13:00,4661,So glad I don't have slots to deal with...  Or many COs for that matter.... Lol
869848,Terry,2014-08-28 18:35:00,14456,"oh, he said slots to deal with nevermind lol"

869881,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-28 21:26:00,8243,"CO's seem to be getting blasted lately. I was told by a CO do not pinch the tail and measure it from tip of mouth to open tail flat beside the fish. If it is questionable, put it back. Do you know how much Walleye $250.00 will buy you?"

869974,206,2014-08-29 13:08:00,563,"I figure if your having to pinch the tail trying to make or break the slot your better off letting it go, here 13.8-19.7 is an easy 14-19 in my boat, if it isnt over 14 or under 19 it goes back!"
