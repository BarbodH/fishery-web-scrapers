868956,mattp33,2014-08-23 19:13:00,290,"strange problem I am having with my Talon, sometimes when it gets deployed it doesnt want to come back up. I hit the button on both remotes and nothin...switch on the talon...nothin. It just clicks like it wants to do something but nothing happens.The strange part of this is, all I have to do is turn my master off then back on and it come back up when I press the button on the talon it self. Kinda annoying!Anyone ever had this happen?I have it wired to a 30amp (may be a 20 amp have to double check that) fuse under the console on the central fuse block. Fuse is still good never had to switch it, and was brand new 4 weeks ago when the talon was installedAny help would be greatThanks"

868972,davey buoy,2014-08-23 19:57:00,5505,"Sounds to me like the master is reseting the motor?,but turning the switch off and on is quite common in the electrical machine industry to reset something. Having said that ,you have a issue for sure.Hope you get it figured out.Overload spike?."

869016,ecmilley,2014-08-24 00:03:00,2163,Does it beep when trying to retract. Have you used the wash port to clean the talon. Had zippo for issues with mine other than getting stuck in soft botoms
869021,mattp33,2014-08-24 00:13:00,290,"Does it beep when trying to retract. Have you used the wash port to clean the talon. Had zippo for issues with mine other than getting stuck in soft botoms   The day after it first happened I washed it out and lubed it as per the directions.  It is happening almost every time now, no beeps, it just clicks...almost like its trying to push it down again.  If i press the up button repeatedly the bottom depth light turns off then the next press it goes up.  Or i reset the master, I think i need a call into Minn Kota for this 1, it really baffles me  I have a video but no clue how to get the vid on here yet, do i need to go through youtube?"
