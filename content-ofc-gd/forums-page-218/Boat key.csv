869840,mattp33,2014-08-28 17:51:00,290,"Last week I had almost lost my boat key, turns out I left it where i got gas but it got me thinking...I only have 1 key for this boat, if I loose it I could be in trouble.  The boat is a Nitro bass boat and my question is where can I get 1 cut?  Do new boats come with 2 keys?  Do you guys have a spare for your boat?  A buddy and I one time got to the lake after 2 hrs of driving and he had forgot his keys, he has an old boat and told me not to worry as he reached for a swiss army knife in his console.  He pulled out the can opener tool and sure as crap it turn the ignition and the engine fired to life! lmao  "
869841,creditmaster,2014-08-28 17:54:00,190,anywhere that cuts keys should do it
869842,mattp33,2014-08-28 17:57:00,290,"anywhere that cuts keys should do it  Really?  Its got a big square base on it, I just thought it was something special.  I will try some places in town.  Thanks"
869843,creditmaster,2014-08-28 18:10:00,190,no prob
869849,bow slayer,2014-08-28 18:40:00,1074,"I am in the same boat,1 key,I took it around to several places and no one could cut an extra for me. If you find out an option please pass along thanks"
869851,BillM,2014-08-28 18:42:00,17367,You're going to have a hard time finding a blank at just any key place..   I'd learn how to bypass the ignition switch
869853,bow slayer,2014-08-28 18:43:00,1074,"You're going to have a hard time finding a blank at just any key place..   I'd learn how to bypass the ignition switch I know i did and i am still looking,no blank would work"
869854,Terry,2014-08-28 18:43:00,14456,"whatever brand motor, go to a dealer and buy the blank anyone should be able to cut it also Pauls lock in  Barrie should be able to fix you up"
869861,floater,2014-08-28 19:27:00,220,Mercury has only 7 different keys I was told. Took the key to a dealership and they noted the Letter on the side and gave me that lettered key and it worked fine. Worked for a 1991 Merc 200 hp and a 2006 15 hp kicker.
869864,msp,2014-08-28 19:41:00,1336,Not too sure where you can get a key cut but a quick suggestion. When I purchased my boat about 8 years ago the seller told me to duct tape the extra key under the console. Sure enough a couple of years later we got to the launch ( 2.5 hrs from my house ) I realized that I had misplaced the key. I reached up under the console and peeled back the duct tape to find my extra key. Problem solved ! Saved my a$$ that day
869870,Garnet,2014-08-28 20:26:00,2056,"For Merc you will see 1f, 2f and as state only few different keys. Yes all 1F keys fit."
869891,mattp33,2014-08-28 22:07:00,290,"Just called BPS and got some new guy on the phone, says hes only been there a week.  He told me that they have a box and they just mtch them up.  Great idea on the extra key under the console, I will be sure to keep an extra on the boat as well as a compartment key.  It is a merc so doens't sound like I will have much problems, anyone know roughly how much these things are?"
869936,AdamS,2014-08-29 02:20:00,161,I had to go to a couple different places to get one made. main reason is the other ones didn't have the blank I needed in stock. I think I paid $5 for it.
869942,DRIFTER_016,2014-08-29 03:03:00,10439,The simple answer is take the key into the dealer. They can get a replacement. If the key goes into the motors forward controls the motor dealer can get  replacements. Also if you lose your keys that fit in the forward controls there is a # stamped either on the ring around the area the key slides into or if you're unlucky on the barrel of the cylinder (to read it you will need to remove the controls and remove the back plate).
869976,Garnet,2014-08-29 13:18:00,2056,I have a set (rod locker and ignition) under dash and another on my truck keys. Never used them but they are there.
869978,Walleye72,2014-08-29 13:26:00,156,I like the key taped under the console idea.   Something interesting I noticed while on holiday this year.  Most people left their keys in the ignition while their boats were at the dock including overnight.  The cottage resort was a group of 11 cottages but on a moderately busy lake.  I always brought mine in.  It felt weird not to.  I wouldn't leave them in my car.  The cottage owner leaves the keys in his boats that have keys as well.
869982,Roy,2014-08-29 13:48:00,13728,I have never taken my boat keys out of the ignition.... ever.
869998,Garnet,2014-08-29 15:09:00,2056,I also have a fish line that goes to the back of boat tied to my boat key and tied to a hose in the battery compartment. Not much security but some..
870010,Steve,2014-08-29 18:23:00,2075,Same here Roy.  I just have the key without chain in my iginition (tiller)...  I have never taken it out.
870012,Bass Tard,2014-08-29 19:20:00,128,"I also only have one key.  I keep it in my truck, because the boat is never without the truck."
870013,Lape0019,2014-08-29 19:20:00,647,"I have a bass tracker (Tracker marine. Same as Nitro) and am surprised you only received 1 key. I have two ignition keys and 4 or 5 compartment keys.  As stated above, any merc dealer will be able to get you the key you need. A spare is always a good idea and the duct tape trick is also a good one."
870058,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-30 07:48:00,8243,"Just this year I started leaving the keys in both ignitions, hard to loose them unless they take the entire rig. My spare key for the big motor won't insert any longer. I keep that on my truck key ring. It won't be long the other key is worn too, actually it is worn as I have to play with it to turn. It is cheaper for me to change the ignition switch then for 2 more keys from Merc I was told at the marina. Ignition switch is less than $30.00.  I better do that."
870061,Tybo,2014-08-30 09:37:00,1373,I have replaced a lot of boat keys with a standard screw driver.
