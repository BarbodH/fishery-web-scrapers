870066,Musky or Specks,2014-08-30 13:32:00,2710,Last week of Sept have a cottage rented on the river for the week. Now I know the river very well for fishing musky but we have 4 kids age 8-14 with little to no fishing experience. My buddy and I will be hitting the musky pretty hard but would like to take the kids out for some easy catching. Doesn't matter what species as long as its plentiful(preferably panfish)Any help would be appreciated. As always I would prefer PM's
