869606,kickingfrog,2014-08-26 22:57:00,8333,"Looks a bit like something Bernie would drive.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/archeologists-discover-labrador-s-1st-snowmobile-1.2747667?cmp=rss  A team of archeologists in Nunatsiavut say they've found Labrador's first snowmobile — and there are plans in the works to get it back up and running. The snowmobile is a nearly 100-year-old Ford Model T that was converted to ride through snow on skis. Chicago scientists used the makeshift snowmobile during an expedition to Labrador, and it was later abandoned in 1928. ""It's an amazing piece of Labrador history,"" said Jamie Brake, an archeologist in Nunatsiavut, on the north coast of Labrador. Brake said the site and the snowmobile were vulnerable. Archeologist Jamie Brake said they brought the snowmobile to Nain to preserve it and to get residents excited about their history. (CBC) ""We know that quite a number of pieces of it had gone missing over the years,"" he said. ""We felt it was important to bring it to Nain, so it could be protected and used to give people a chance to learn about their history and to get people excited about their past."" Brake's team used modern snowmobiles to tow it to Nain, also on Labrador's north coast. Now, the snowmobile is on display. ""It's the first time I've seen something that old... almost 100 years old,"" said Nain resident Elizabeth Kohlmeister. The machine is in great shape for its old age — it still has its original engine and transmission. ""[it's] got a crank on the front of it that you would turn to get the engine started,"" Brake said. Archeologist Jamie Brake said they took the Ford Model T snowmobile to Nain to preserve and restore it. (CBC) The plan now is to get the makeshift snowmobile restored, and in a couple of years, it could be driving around town. ""This is absolutely restorable and we can — it's totally in the realm of possibility to get this thing running again,"" Brake said. ""I think people would be pretty excited about their history and heritage if they were seeing this, the original snowmobile, in Labrador, driving around."" Susan Kaplan, an anthropology professor with Bowdoin College, said it's an exciting find. ""It's going to have a new life, new meaning,"" she said. ""It's bringing it into the 21st century where it still has a life."""

869614,chris.brock,2014-08-26 23:29:00,4053,"I bet Bernie could fix it when it breaks  Looks like it's more cut through the snow rather than float on the snow  I think this is the first snowmachine I've seen that my Bravo could beat in a race, maybe, maybe not"
869615,outllaw,2014-08-26 23:33:00,1232,sooo cool
869620,cheaptackle,2014-08-27 00:00:00,849,Episode of Restoration Garage (place in Bradford) had one shown being tested on the ice.  Way cool!  Michael

869653,Old Ironmaker,2014-08-27 09:35:00,8243,"I like it. They brought the machine to Nain for the residents to see, what all 10 of them? Actually I just Googled Nain and there are 1036 residents in 36 square miles, and the land around Nain is beautiful. The article never said exactly where they found it. When I read archeologist I think digging under the ground, maybe digging in a barn this time.  You have a cool machine Nain."
869663,Garnet,2014-08-27 13:24:00,2056,My buddy's dad had one. Cool looking contraption .
869665,TJQ,2014-08-27 13:28:00,7806,Very cool!
869670,bigbuck,2014-08-27 14:06:00,2449,As soon as I saw it I thought of Restoration Garage as well. Nice piece of Canadiana.
869717,cheaptackle,2014-08-27 21:31:00,849,"Yeah but didn't the one on Restoration Garage have both wheels and skis on the front?  I know it was also a tandem axle - they had to let the air outta the tires to get the treads on, but man did they scoot around with it when it was done!  Michael"
