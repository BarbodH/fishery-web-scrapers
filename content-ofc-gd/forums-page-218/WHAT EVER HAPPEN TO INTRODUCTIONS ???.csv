869233,Steve1991,2014-08-25 14:45:00,27,"Ah what the heck.  I posted an intro several months back but it doesn't hurt to do another.  I'm Steve. 23. Favourite species to target in the summer are muskie, walleye and bass; and in the winter it's all about the lakers for me.  Most fishing is done in the Haliburton/Kawarthas area.  I've been on this site for 7-8 months now I think, and the amount of help/knowledge I've gained is invaluable.  Much of my spare time is devoted to either fishing or (somewhat) fishing related.  Whether it's making my own spinnerbaits or fixing up old tinnys, I can't get enough of it.  Currently, I am doing a complete overhaul on a 1959 3hp Gale Buccaneer and have an old 1948 Johnson Seahorse 2.5hp in the backshed waiting to be cleaned up and running again.  Fishing this summer for me has been a little slow as I haven't been able to get out much, but I have a 6 day long weekend coming up thanks to some owed vacation time that'll hopefully turn things around.  Great thread - nice to see some intro's from the newbies and vets of this forum.  Steve."
869533,AKRISONER,2014-08-26 18:26:00,5558,"Hey Guys,  I guess this is the place where i can formally introduce myself. My name is Scott and I have been fishing pretty much from the time I was old enough to hold a fishing rod. I was born in Flin Flon Manitoba, hence my families passion for pickerel fishing.  As time went on my families interest in fishing definitely declined until our family purchased a cottage in the pointe au baril region in 2008. Since that point my interest in fishing has steadily increased year after year until reaching a real peak.  I can definitely say that this year has been the first year where I feel like I am beginning to obsess over fishing and I think being a member of this forum has something to do with it. I have spent a lot of years blindly attempting to figure things out on my own as my immediate family has less interest in fishing other species therefore they rely on me for any knowledge that I am able to gain through research and trial and error. I am definitely the most committed fisherman in my family.  I do most of my fishing solo, therefore being part of this community and specifically speaking to a few knowledgeable individuals directly has helped me gain more knowledge in a 3 month time span than I have learnt in my entire life.  Personally I mainly target pickerels in the spring and fall, laketrout, pike, largemouths and starting this year have taken a big interest in smallmouth bass fishing. I specifically really look forward to the day that I know enough to be able to share my personal experiences and lessons with my nephews (kids someday) and people in this community in the same way that people have taught me over the years. Tight Lines."

As it was we did good to grab it and release it both times, but I spent about an hour and 45 minutes laying flat out the stern of the canoe trying to revive while daughter rowed us to shore against a 20k wind. Then another 15 minutes with the canoe pulled up on shore and then I hit it over the head with a rock and we had lunch!  As for intros... the whole thing is over rated IMHO !"

I shore fished and searched the local creeks and conservation areas on and off throughout my life, and this year, I finally got an 89 Ranger 320V. So I've spent my free time venturing out into the waters in search of the big ones. I mainly fish for bass and pike and love doing it, I'm starting to get into walleye, but I'd also like to try for musky, salmon and trout at some point. I just want to thank everyone who has not only helped me but also shared their experiences on this site. I think the combination of knowledge, experiences and willingness to share is what makes this site unique. It makes me think of a saying,  OFC ""for the fishermen, by the fishermen"" because you guys are what make this site."

My wife and I are most often bass fishing as we took a charter a couple of years ago and have at least some idea what we're doing.  Most of what I ever catch is with the old worm and bobber rig but I'm learning to use my other tackle to some effect.  Finally caught a decent catfish out of Hamilton harbor the other day on a spoon but my phone died before I could take a pic.  I work nights at a men's shelter downtown and am free to go fish around 7am most days.  If any more experienced shore fishermen would like to hook up and share some tricks that would be awesome.   Otherwise I'm enjoying following the forum's here and finding some great advice. Thanks all, look forward to finding some new fishing friends!!"

I also have a cabin on a trout stream in northern Michigan that empties into the Au Sable river. I fly fish there from early April thru November.  I like dogs better than most people, and get really honked off when I see someone on this, or other sites, criticize another's fighting, netting, handling, and reviving of fish (unless blatantly malicious). We don't exactly go after them with kid gloves to begin with....especially muskie.  My favorite boat companions are: My two Sons My Dog Anyone who seldom speaks and fishes smart and hard Anyone who doesn't constantly cast across my line when I'm operating the trolling motor from the front....if you don't like it...spend $15k+ on your own boat.  AS you can guess, when my sons aren't around, I often fish alone.....and it doesn't bother me in the least."

I'm not sure I have the patience for it. I'm more used to trolling a lure behind a canoe or motorboat and catching at least a few small bass, but bigger ones and pike/walleye with some luck. The predominant float fishermen here in Wasaga (and on the Beaver and Bighead when I tried there) seem to stand for hours w/o a bite sometimes.

Primarily catch and release (single guy, if you want fish come with me and catch it yourself!   )  when I can find the fish but I enjoy getting out regardless if I catch anything.  Proud owner of a 2007 White Nitro 640LX w/ 90 Opti but hoping to trade up soon to something bigger to handle rough water and fish longer haha.  You'll find me all over the place but primarily Lake Simcoe, Nippising or Rice Lake are my usual haunts in my Nitro or along the various tributaries in my waders.  I'd like to say this is a fantastic site and from all my years of reading the forums I've found the people on here friendly and informative.  I especially like seeing all the fantastic pictures and learning of new places."

722009,beaser,2012-08-12 05:30:00,19,"I'm Bryan from Barrie and I'm just getting into fishing (again) Two weeks ago I bought my grandson a fishing rig and I liked the feel of the equipment so much I bought a rig for myself. It's been years since I fished and so I scoured the web and found this forum. I'm 67 and haven't fished since I was 28 but I do remember the absolute serenity that I had experienced sitting by the water with rod in hand.  My grandson wanted a rod so I dropped by Tromlays Tackle Box in Orillia. I bought Sebastien a Pfleuger Xion with a medium action rod. I left and drove home. The next day we were at a bar-b-q close by Tromblays so I skipped out and stopped in to look at a rig for me. I wound up getting the Pfleuger president XT with a Fenwick eagle light action rod. Not knowing my asp from a hole in the ground I had the spool loaded with 8lb braided (250 meters, oyvey)   I'm a gimp but a fiesty one and I do manage to get around. My main passion is photography and I carry a canon 7D with some pretty heavy lenses. I manage with a battery pack installed. The batterypack gives me a second control location for the shutter and fucus so I can hold the camera in a vertical configuration. I have  a badly torn right bicep and rotator. I have arthritus in both hands, elbows and left shoulder. I have had my knees replaced a few times and suffer from chronic pain.   I can get around and cope but it is emabarrassing at times. A boat is out of the question so It'll have to be shore fishing. I figured I get some 0 or #1 mepps spinners and a few small spoons and do some recconaisance.  Two amazing pluses I have found are that as a cripple and an old fart I do get some decent discounts. I get to fish for free and I get into parks a very reduced rate.  For the past month I've spent a fair bit of time with a long lens and a tripod at a few conservation areas resulting in some very exciting shots. I had posted a pic of a duck on the photo forum. Ihave about 500 or so frames to work at but the thrill is being outside and close to nature (again) Now I hope to combine the camara and the fishing rod. I had stopped at the midhurst MNR office and had a nice chat with a conservation officer and he did give me some locations to scout.  Tomorrow I'm planning on a visit to bass pro to buy some lures. Any suggestions? I figured some Mepps, little Cleo's or other small spoons. I'm not even sure what I'll be fishing for but there are some old standards. Any suggestions would be sincerely appreciated:worthy:  The wife retired 2 weeks ago and she's been pretty good about it all. i'm sure she'll accompany me and she can read her book while I fish. I have to get a few smarts before I go out with the grandkid.  Having lived up north when I was younger I do prefer clean, fast water as opposed to stagnant cess pools. I know it's out there but accessing it is another matter.  It's absolutely amazing at how far tackle has come. For the money the equipment feels well balanced and fairly well built. The braided line feels like sewing thread besides mono. I was used to the old bait cast.  I'm glad this thread was started, just what the doctor ordered.    Glad to be here  Bryan"

I live in a small town called Mansfield just NW of Alliston and love the small town/country livin ! I have been fishing all my life and growing up beside a small brook trout stream in Caledon was where it started. I use to travel to some real backwoods places when I was young with my friends and there dads with 4X4's and that is were my passion for backwoods adventures started. As well my uncle would take me to a great bass lake annually called Lingham Lake for some real adventures. Myself and a couple friends continued this tradition untill a couple years ago when the lake just became too crowded and messy for that true backwoods feel ( sad really ) I now enjoy finding that backwoods honey hole and getting there either in my trusty toyota 4X4 , quad or just portaging in . I don't get out much in the winter to ice fish but spend the winter time working and saving for my many soft water trips of the summer/fall I also enjoy reading this board everyday and I have had alot of laughs doing so   as well as learning alot of things along the way !

My calendar year starts with finding open water for steelhead and lake O browns. Then pike open, then walleye, then musky which takes me through the summer with a few days of bassin mixed in, than the salmon start to show up at the piers then the steelhead are running again. Fall finds me fishing weekends or days off looking for muskies and afternoons or mornings close to the GTA for steelhead. That's until I get the downrigging for Lake O salmon itch which I've been thinking about for sometime now. One of my favourite feats is learning a new body of water. We have so many great angling opportunities here in Ontario. I'm 29 years old and all I can think about is retiring so I can fish everyday LOL. I think I have a problem, glad I'm in good company here."

I am hoping to get back to fishing more in the future, as well as contributing here a bit more as well.  I work in Toronto, but live just outside of Penetang, so I spend a fair amount of time commuting.  I do have a boat, but the motor is done, so until that is replaced I either rent or try to hook up with someone...hooking up with someone is more challenging as I work weekends generally and have weekdays off.  I keep thinking of trying shore fishing but it's not something I've done, and know very little about where to go, although I'm told there are lots of places near me that are good...if you want to share with me, feel free to PM me, or better yet, invite me to join you and show me the ropes  One thing I am doing is getting my best friends boys into fishing...this has been fairly easy  next will hopefully be a couple of great nephews and a great niece  That's all for now Maureen"

Also fished with a bunch of members over the years and I can honestly say I've always had great time with all of them. I have an OFC sticker on the back of the boat. Had people drive beside me on the hwy. and give me a thumbs up or a friendly honk. Even had people on the lake or at the dock recognize me or the sticker and start a conversation. Always great to meet new people who share my passion for the sport. I even bumped into TJ at Casino Rama one evening after a Styx concert. (he was at the show with some buddies) Not the first time meeting the boss, but still a nice surprise.  I'll fish for anything and have the gear for most species, hardwater or softwater, but my main quarry these days are salmon, walleye and the occasional panfish outing to keep the kids entertained.

We used to launch the boat to rig Lake O at Jordan harbor on the south side of the QEW at Campbells Marina.It was a big deal to catch walleye in Lake Erie at that time but the bass were always abundant and close to shore all year. Things change and the fishing oppurtunities are tremendous all across Ontario.From the K=W area we just get used to driving the 1.5 - 2 hours to fish almost all the great lakes and their tribs so there is always somewhere that is ON! I fish and hunt (waterfowl,deer) as much as I can.My wife understands my passion for the outdoors and has always supported my interests,yes I am very lucky.My kids are grown,I have just retired and can pursue my interests at will.

721849,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-11 16:00:00,535,"Hey everyone!    My name is Christopher, I moved to Belleville about 6 years ago, grew up in the Bancroft area. I did a lot of bass fishing from shore growing up. I didn't fish much after moving down here until a couple of years ago. Bought a 14' tin boat with a 9.9 last spring and got into walleye, pike and musky fishing. I upgraded to a 16' starcraft with a 40hp tiller last fall and other than some trolling for lakers early this year I've been pretty much just focused on pike and musky. I still have a lot to learn and I'm up for fishing for anything though musky fishing really gets my blood pumping and I'm determined to get better at catching them! I still have to get around to catching some of those big quinte walleye, especially since I've never even caught a 20"" walleye and I live so close to the bay!"
721855,BillM,2012-08-11 16:42:00,17367,"Hi, my name is Bill and I like to catch black boots with my Len Thompson 5 of Diamonds when they are in the Credit.   Shallow water works best!"
721858,Skipper D,2012-08-11 16:50:00,1970,"I am unable to remember if i ever introduced me self or not .I'd hate to do it twice if i already did it once ,"
721859,misfish,2012-08-11 17:03:00,29133,LOL Bill     Think you missed the meaning of the topic Ron.
721094,misfish,2012-08-08 20:54:00,29133,"Seems we have many new members joing up,which is very cool.   But,no intro. This is/well was/no is,and will be,a community.A family community.

721102,NAW,2012-08-08 21:06:00,4022,I was thinking the same thing.  Well said Brian.
721119,GBW,2012-08-08 22:15:00,8460,"Hi all! I'm not new here, I think.  but I'm Geoff and I like to fish."
721120,davey buoy,2012-08-08 22:19:00,5505, Hi Geoff!!
721130,sneak_e_pete,2012-08-08 22:52:00,540,"Been a member for a long time, but I guess I never really let people know who I am.  My name is Dan.  I live in Grimsby with my beautiful wife and 3 boys aged 5, 3 and 10 months.  I just bought my first big boat, a Smokercraft Promag.  We have a trailer near Dunnville, so I am learning lake Erie.  This board has been amazing for information and cool stuff.... love it!"
721141,Broker,2012-08-08 23:48:00,482,"As Dan did, I will also introduce myself to those that don't know me. My name is Caleb, I'm a highschool student in Cayuga. I've been fishing with a couple members of this board and it was great, this place is awesome  I spend most of my time fishing the grand river for whatever bites but my favourites are the strong river bass & eyes.  I do some kayak fishing and do alot of camping. Lately I've tried my luck at fly fishing and what fun it has been! catching bass often now and the odd mooneye. Tommorow I'm going on a hunt for walleye on the fly so watch for a report tommorow  Thats all for now, thanks!"
721148,Spanky80,2012-08-09 00:12:00,152,"I've been a long-time lurker, a member for a little while, but what the heck, I will take this opportunity for an introduction.  I'm Shayne, I live in between Pembroke and Petawawa, Ontario, on the Ottawa River.  I fish the river in winter and spring for walleye, occasionally in Quebec for trout, but spend most of my time in the summer on the less travelled lakes in the area, including Lake Clear (my favorite), Lake Dore and Constant Lake.  Once the fall comes and the loonies and (over)enforcement have vacated the river, I am back on the Ottawa for the fall run of walleye.  I have a 2010 Stratos 285XL DC with a 150HO ETEC Evinrude, and a 2006 Sylvan Sea Snapper with a Johnson 15hp that stays in the water in front of my place for quick fishing trips out on the river.  Great site, I have learned lots over the last few years!"
721151,crappieperchhunter,2012-08-09 00:42:00,2582,This is all I gotta say Brian     
721152,mercman,2012-08-09 00:52:00,7054,"This is a great idea Brian  For the new guys and the old timers who dont know me. My  name is Paul. I am originally from Ottawa, but have lived most of my adult life in Montreal. I fish Walleye, Bass and new to Musky. I own a 2010 Princecraft Sarfish DLX SC, with a 40 HP Merc. I have been on the forum since july 2010, and although i started off as a fliberty gibbit, i have calmed and matured since then I fish mainly the St Lawerence and lakes, but i have fished White Lake, The Rideau and others.  Hey Spanky, i was born in Pembroke"
721153,spincast,2012-08-09 00:52:00,3279,"well said Brian (and yes, I admit,  I stumbled here on my intro 2 years ago - this being the first forum I joined ). So for those who havent noticed  I am a fishing addict. But these days I seem to be better known as the guy who goes fishing with, and consistently gets out fished by, G-man. Give a man fish fish, feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and feed him for life; teach your son to fish and get upstaged each time you go out.  No better reward for a father. Introduced him to bass fishin' on Temagami last week - kid taught himself how to jig by watching the fish.    A full Temagami report to come later ----"
721154,Spanky80,2012-08-09 00:58:00,152,  G'day to a fellow fisherman from the Valley!

721165,GBW,2012-08-09 02:29:00,8460,"HOT DANG!  Maybe the admin's may want to consider an intro sticky post for all to add to?  PS, I'm Geoff and I like to fish..."
721176,backbay,2012-08-09 02:57:00,773," Thanks for introducing yourself, Spincast. Your mentor G-Man, of course, needs no introduction!"

Been fishing for 30 plus years.....but started young mostly in urban areas around southern Ontario (toronto, Hamilton, dundas, Burlington)! Favorites species are bass, pike, steelhead, walleye. Love to fish, whenever I can get out, it this summer has been about my daughter. I'll catch up down the road.  Cheers."
721181,eman,2012-08-09 03:08:00,101,"I've also been trying to update my info for some time; picture, info, avatar?,  it's a bit overwhelming especially if your not a techy. Still haven't got my jpeg to show when I post. This is might detour some newbies."
721215,Hud,2012-08-09 12:07:00,140,"well alright havent done this since I first joined so its a good idea....lol Name is Eric.  I tend to go by Hud.  I live in Brooklin. Moved to Canada from the states about 4 years ago.  Engaged to a lovely Canadian girl and getting married in a couple of months.  I tend to prefer to fish for muskie, walleye and pike but hope to get the hang of steelies as well"
721216,Broker,2012-08-09 12:10:00,482,"Yeah, I do agree. When i first started i was avatar-less for while. I can't remember what exactly I did to solve the problem but what i believe i did was went to a picture editing website on the internet and downsxaled te image (because it said the file was to large) then it worked for me!  dunno if that is your problem too or not, but i hope it helps!"
721224,Spiel,2012-08-09 13:05:00,9065," I'd be more than happy to help eman, just PM me any photos or photo links or any questions re: help."

721308,Toad Hunter,2012-08-09 16:45:00,261,"oye, haven't had to do this since my first meeting but here it goes- My name is Steve, I'm born and raised in Kitchener, and have had a family trailer at the Northern Eagle trailer resort my entire life On Kashagawigamog in Haliburton, and have recently bought my own to enjoy for years to come. I live with my gf Tasha, who I have recently got into fishing with me, and we are expecting our first born on New years day (hope he likes fishing- yes we've been told its a wee lad). I'm a HUGE miami dolphins fan, must be the logo, cuz it sure ain't the ""win"" column (as of late) that has me rootin for em. I mainly fish for bass,walleye and pike, but have recently been stockin up on musky gear, and have pulled the odd laker out of the ice back in the day."
721352,misfish,2012-08-09 20:01:00,29133,"Very cool fellas.  I thought this would be a good thread for the older long time members to know the newer members. Seem to be working.
