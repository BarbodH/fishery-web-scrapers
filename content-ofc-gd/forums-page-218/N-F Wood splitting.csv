869203,OhioFisherman,2014-08-25 12:41:00,6623,"Just curious, has anyone used one of these?  http://www.hardwareworld.com/Licksplit-Maul-12-Lb-p7OAIAY.aspx  My experience with wood splitting goes back some time, the good old days of the Sotz Monster Maul. Although that company was local they no longer seem to be in business, and finding an original Monster Maul is a rarity here even at garage sales or flea markets.  Heck I even did it with wedges and a sledge hammer, kids these days seem to think it's a lot of work."
869209,leaf4,2014-08-25 12:58:00,2466,I have a 6lb wood splitting axe and it was the best purchase I've made on an axe for ease of use by far
869210,Rod Caster,2014-08-25 13:06:00,5784,"Never used or seen that one in link. Why so special? Just the extra weight? I have a 10lbs maul. Works fine, but I still need a wedge/sledge for some of the yellow birch and oak. I'm predicting some kind of splitter in the future but can't justify cost just yet."
869212,OhioFisherman,2014-08-25 13:19:00,6623,"Well the Monster Maul had a steel handle and was 15lbs? A 38 inch handle for more leverage. Some of the cheaper steel handled ones I have seen only have a 30 inch handle, which seems to be an issue in a lot of the reviews.  Pretty much indestructible and perhaps we have a lot more hardwoods down here than you do up there?  My son and his buddy have been handling the wood splitting, they have already broken a wood and fiberglass handle. I don't think they have a good aim? Neither can cast worth crap either! LOL  My splitting and casting days are over too! I am hoping a steel handled one would be more bulletproof for them to use."
869220,DanD,2014-08-25 13:58:00,2223,Yea my dad got tired of replacing axe handles; so he went and found a steel pipe and had it welded to the head of the maul. We couldn't break it but we did manage too put a bend in it. LOL It seemed to come natural for us 3 boys to fine ways of pissing pops off.  Dan.
869273,Sinker,2014-08-25 18:34:00,8692,The steel pipe welded to the head of the maul has worked for me for years.  The trick is to learn how to hit where your looking......or look where you want to hit!!  S.
869308,OhioFisherman,2014-08-25 21:26:00,6623,"LOL sinker, I never had a problem splitting log sections, the kids are splitting slab wood. Ya guys, see the crazy mix of wood grain? That is a piece for your bonfires, don't waste your time or break things trying to split that!"
869335,bigugli,2014-08-25 23:00:00,6138,"I use to swing a 15lb maul for years splitting upward of 40 cord a year. On a bad day, and in a bad mood, I could snap 3 wooden handles in a morning. Wife bought me an axe with the ""indestructible"" fiberglass handle. It lasted a week before the handle started to crack inside the head and the head began to slip"
869366,OhioFisherman,2014-08-26 00:37:00,6623,"My brother had a tree service for a few years and I used to help him out, the monster maul worked great. Once he took on a really big job the did get a hydraulic log splitter, some pieces just seemed easier to split on the ground than lift on the splitter.  Mom and dad had a spare garage 250 feet behind their home with a drive back to it. It became wood city, we had split wood on both sides of the drive back to it. We had better luck clearing an 8 acre ravine for a lake site than the guy did with the lake, his dam washed out the first year.  I ordered one, it seems like the way to go, have to see if the boys can break it? LOL"
869369,woodenboater,2014-08-26 00:49:00,2277,I'd just use a regular maul with splitting cheeks. or put it in the fire pit or banked in the stove for the overnight burn
869772,OhioFisherman,2014-08-28 03:12:00,6623,"It came this morning and they used it this evening, said it works great! and they haven't broken it yet! LOL  Just curious, is there a special type of steel pipe to use for a handle? I have two 8 pounders I might have it done to. I am thinking a little longer handle on them might make them more effective and if it's steel?"
869776,DanD,2014-08-28 09:36:00,2223,"I'm getting old I know; but if I had a bunch of wood to split, this would be my choice.           http://www.harborfreight.com/5-ton-log-splitter-61373.html  For $280.00 I'd give it a try?  Dan."
869777,Rod Caster,2014-08-28 10:29:00,5784,"I have some 32"" diameter yellow birch that I need to split...how the heck would I lift it on to a splitter? haha.  Unless, that is jusitfication for buying a tractor!!...Wife, we need a tractor!  "
869781,DanD,2014-08-28 11:26:00,2223,Vertical splitter?
869782,Fish4Eyes,2014-08-28 11:40:00,1022,Rod Caster: split them in half first to reduce the weight and then you should be able to lift it onto splitter.
869783,Rod Caster,2014-08-28 11:51:00,5784,"I suppose a verticle splitter would be handy for mid sized logs (too big to really lift, but not impossibly big like 36"" diam.)  As far as splitting in half, it kind of defeats the purpose. Logs that size can be chipped away, not split in half. Plus a half still weights like 100-150lbs.  The other obstacle is that they are deep in the bush, through some rough trails, not sure working a splitter would be easy to work with out there."
869784,Bernie,2014-08-28 12:01:00,3190,Find that most of those big logs split fairly easy near the base. Its where you get into the branches or old damage that it gets tough.I split the ones that size in the bush.
869790,Sinker,2014-08-28 12:56:00,8692,"sledge and a wedge will split almost anything. If its got a straight grain, it will split. I'm working on yellow birch right now. Its tough as nails!! No match for the hydraulics, but its tough stuff. My splitter can be used horizontal or vertical.  Pretty handy for those huge gnarly chunks.    S."
869795,Rod Caster,2014-08-28 13:25:00,5784,"You are right Bernie, the base pieces split surprisingly nice... not easy, but easier than expected. I have a good bush trailer so I split in bush and load from there. Had to take a break yesterday, my abs were killing me haha"
