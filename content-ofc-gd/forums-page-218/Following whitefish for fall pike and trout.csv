869503,troutologist,2014-08-26 16:25:00,951,Been having real good luck up north following the spawning runs of whitefish to get into big northerns and lakers. Water temps are dropping up here and its big fish time.     
869515,LucG,2014-08-26 17:31:00,779,Nice fish. That laker is huge!  What techniques are you using to find and follow the whitefish?
869520,Beavertail,2014-08-26 17:44:00,331,"Wow, nice fish.....I did a double-take with the Laker, what an ancient looking specimen!!"
869522,leaf4,2014-08-26 17:53:00,2466,what a bunch of beasts! also had to do a double take with the second lol

869537,Joeytier,2014-08-26 18:52:00,3990,Look at the head on that laker!!  Some amazing specimens for sure
869540,Gallie,2014-08-26 18:58:00,1215,"Sweet gators, sometimes i wish i lived much farther north."
869541,troutologist,2014-08-26 19:01:00,951,"Inflows and outflows have been key. Water temps dropping in the 50Fs. Been throwing big (6"") flies that mimic herring or whitefish. Big plastics and bucktails work as well These fish are hunting and will travel a long way to nail baits. Something that moves water so they can key in on it."
869544,Jds63,2014-08-26 19:48:00,1365,wow .... beasts for sure .... the tail on the laker looks massive !!!
869547,Musky or Specks,2014-08-26 20:12:00,2710,That laker is as ugly as a 10 beer pick up
