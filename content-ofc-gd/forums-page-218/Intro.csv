Name is Dave and do most of my fishing in the spring and fall or migratory river fish.  Recently purchased a fishing kayak and i'm loving taking it out, even on the bigger lakes, although success has been limited.   Also tried out ice fishing last year for the first time and I can't wait for the hard water season to begin.  I'll be out on sturgeon this weekend by verulum park.  If you see a big red kayak, that's probably me!"
