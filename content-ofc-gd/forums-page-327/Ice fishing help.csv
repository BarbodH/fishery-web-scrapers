769740,youngvedder,2013-02-23 20:57:00,72,"First time heading out around Barrie for some ice fishing and wanted to get ideas on places to go for some perch?  Assuming Simcoe, just not sure what area to head out from. Thx!!"
769775,hockeyplayerz_14,2013-02-23 23:28:00,160,you can go off Gilford road or highway 89. walk out to the group and enjoy
769778,Acountdeleted,2013-02-23 23:53:00,2562,"Go to Highway 89, drive until you can drive no further. Look for the large group of yellow huts, walk towards them until you tire out (I find 200 meters away is a great spot) put a minnow head on..... anything I bet you could catch perch on a safty pin and a ball of yarn.  Have fun."
