767487,HTHM,2013-02-13 05:15:00,4082,"An update via email from Pikeslayer:  Sean's condition remains much the same.  Although still critical, he is stable enough that they have scheduled some neurological tests for a better look at what's 'going on' upstairs. We still remain positive and determined that Sean will pull through this. http://www4.albertahealthservices.ca/wellwishes/"
767607,motv8tr,2013-02-13 21:28:00,2587,"Thanks for the update, happy to hear he is now stable, and hoping he comes out of his coma soon..  Maureen"
767629,wuchikubo,2013-02-13 23:12:00,1114,"Although I have never met you or your son, my thoughts are out to you and your family. In order to send the email to Sean, we will need to enter his last name too.  Stay strong. Hoping he will come out of his coma soon.  Stan"
767663,Pikeslayer,2013-02-14 01:19:00,1443,"Thanks Albert, One more detail. Sean's family name is Murphy. Thanks to every one in the community. Sean continues to fight!!!"
767666,mercman,2013-02-14 01:25:00,7054,"and with his familly and our prayers, he will recover Simon."

769266,danbouck,2013-02-21 11:54:00,4380,"An update   Just realized its been a week since the last email update and must apologize for being 'tardy' and keeping y'all in suspense. That said, Sean's progress can't be measured day to day and it is much more encouraging seeing changes week to week. So, since last week; - Sean's ""Glasgow Coma Score"" (google it) has increased from a 4 to 8. Meaning his response to stimuli has improved. - His eyes do open, but do not 'track'. This is still a significant improvement. - He responds to touch and speech with increased heart rate and blood pressure. I truly believe he hears us  so keep those emails coming (even if if you've already sent one!!) http://www4.albertahealthservices.ca/wellwishes/ Be sure to select Royal Alexandra Hospital in the location drop down menu. Sean's room number is ICU-18. Family name: Murphy - The medical team performed a tracheostomy today so he can start breathing on his own. If he's able to maintain this and reach an unassisted 48 hr period, Sean will be released from ICU hopefully by/before the end of next week!!! - Once he has been released from ICU, he'll be assessed for short/long term care/rehab and if an 'equivalent' medical team/facility can accept him in the GTA, he will be transferred home to Ontario. Timeline could be 6 weeks to 3 months??  Sean's road to full recovery is still a long, winding and unknown road. But we all know that he is a fighter and is working hard to overcome this. We have a small and growing army determined to help him win this fight and your positive thoughts, prayers and emails are definitely working. Please stay determined and keep them coming.  Brian Labrie is due to visit in the next few days and we're working on having Marianne, Meghan & Tyler fly in on March 1st for a few days  Please feel free to share/post the good news. Keep those emails coming as they are a little thing that Sean & I look forward to every day.  Until next time, a huge BTW: Sean's family and good friends here in Alberta have been his colleagues and family owners @ Mobile Augers. The Murphy's could not have wished for the love and support from Sean's Alberta family. They have been beyond amazing. New friends forever:) (note to Fleming Alumni: you won't regret a career with Mobile).  Thx all,"
769267,lew,2013-02-21 12:07:00,12766,Some encouraging words there and best wishes from my family to yours for more of the same.
769284,quickme,2013-02-21 13:57:00,261,its great hearing that Sean is getting better.  It does seem like a long road and Simon I can't imagine what you have been through during this experience.  Your strength is a tribute to all good fathers out there!  It may be a long road to recovery for Sean but at least he has an army of loved ones along the way to help him through.  Stay strong and please keep us updated.   Nick
769307,TJQ,2013-02-21 16:08:00,7806,I hope he continues to improve.

766347,Pikeslayer,2013-02-08 22:17:00,1443,"I have received many PM's with prayers, best wishes and questions. As well as FB, emails & phone calls. It is becoming challenging to keep up with responses so I thought it would be best to post here for all of our community. PM's and emails are still welcome but I would respectfully request no phone calls and thank you for understanding. I've attached a link at the end of the update concerning accident details (non graphic, just the facts). It looks like I will be residing in Edmonton for the foreseeable future and will try to post updates as often as needed. Thank you all in advance for your blessings, prayers and best wishes. Sean needs all the help he can get!!!  Simon"
766350,Pikeslayer,2013-02-08 22:20:00,1443,"Sean is stable but remains in critical condition. He is currently comatose without drug induced protocol. Although this is not great news, there is hope and lets not let go of that!! They fixed the broken right arm and suspect soft tissue/ligament damage to the right knee but are unable to confirm due to his current condition. There are no internal injuries and his heart is strong! Right now all efforts and resources are focused on Sean's brain injury. His Royal Alexander neurological team is fantastic (one of the best  in Canada) and very forthcoming with information ( no crap with these guys) and diagnosis. Recovery is going to be a long haul with many challenges and unknowns. Many good thoughts and prayers need to be said before this is done. Please remind God that Sean is a keeper. I will bring Sean home!! just not sure when. Thx for all the FB postings, texts, emails and voicemails. I will read every one to Sean. All the family are truly overwhelmed and appreciative of your support.  As well, Sean lost a great coworker and mentor in this tragic accident. Please don't forget Ron and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  God bless you all. And of course Sean.

An ex- girlfriend... from when we were both 15... at 18 years old she got caught in the PTO on her fathers tractor while bringing in the hay, shattering her skull and most bones in her body. Parents told she'd never come out of the coma.. she did.. 14 months later. Told she'd never walk... she did.. a few years later. Finally got a knee joint just a year ago October  .. darn near 32 years later! Happy with what she's worked her way through and where she's got in life.  I wish your son the best.. and that he's out of this coma SOON!"
