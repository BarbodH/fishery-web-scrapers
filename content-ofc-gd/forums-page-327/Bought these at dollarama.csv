766500,Cudz,2013-02-09 18:29:00,2652,"Bought a couple laser lure 5"" swimbait with laser jighead.  Prety gimmicky but it is a good jig head with a big hook and the 5"" body looks pretty nice too.  I bet I can catch a laker or two through the ice with these.  I bought them for $2.  Not bad.  Might be a decent pike bait in the spring too.  Dollarama actually had a decent spinning reel for $3. It was rear drag and when I say decent I mean compared to the piece of garbage we had to use for our dollarama tourney a few years ago.  One even had an aluminum spool.   "

766541,d_paluch,2013-02-09 22:14:00,343,"Proven Fact, Laser Light Attracts Fish  that made me laugh. Probably not a bad bait though, wonder if it'll swim straight"

766825,Cudz,2013-02-11 01:09:00,2652,"Hey Rob, tthere were only 2 packs left at the south side store on bryne drive. I have not checked the others.  Worth a look.  There are like 4 or 5 other dollaramas in town."
769898,johnnyb,2013-02-24 17:57:00,3413,I grabbed those last year from Princess Auto....couldn't turn'em down for $2.  I like the colour and profile of the plastic body....not sure if the light helps or hurts. Did get a real close look from a couple lakers on Simcoe....but I hadn't yet clued into the idea of making them chase so I never closed the deal.
