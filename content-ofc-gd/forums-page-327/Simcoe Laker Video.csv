769379,misfish,2013-02-21 21:16:00,29133,Great vid Steve. Are finding more naturals then stockers this season? Definitly can see the difference it the body colors in the fish.
769385,Slayingm,2013-02-21 21:56:00,204,"Great job and nice vid coverage Steve!.  Fishing has been nothing short of awesome so far this season... if you see me and the Argo out on the main lake come over and say hi... I live out there Fri, Sat and Sun. Looks like a softwater date to share a boat together. Continued success on 'spank'n dem fish!"

One thing that has been far more prevalent this season, is the lakers regurgitating herring.  Big 9-13 inchers.  They're chewing out there and staying healthy!And Greg, lets do it buddy!"
