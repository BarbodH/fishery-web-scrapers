770255,hotsky,2013-02-26 03:52:00,400,I might be going to London tomorrow and was wondering what are the ice conditions at Fanshawe lake? How think is the ice? Anyone been there lately? (I've never ice fished there before). I'm assuming it's well frozen over and should be still safe enough? If not I can always try the Thames river hopefully it's not murky?  Any help/info is appreciated.
