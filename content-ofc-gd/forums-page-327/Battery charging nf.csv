769711,archer379,2013-02-23 16:14:00,277,Looking for ideas on how to. Charge my deep cycle batterys. We will be a trailer park for the first time this year and they dont have any shore power. Has any one set up a solar power charger system.
769712,BillM,2013-02-23 16:22:00,17367,"Solar power won't cut it...   Portable generator is what we used to charge the Minn Kota while out in the sticks..    Drop it in the boat, connect it to the onboard charger and let it run until it dies..   Extremely quiet in the boat, doesn't bother anyone, etc.."
769721,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-23 16:54:00,10439,"Yep, 1000 watt Honda or Yamaha generator is all you need. Solar won't recharge fast enough with the size and quality of the panels you can get on your boat."
769742,Fisherman,2013-02-23 21:18:00,7201,"Are you talking deep cycle for your trailer or your boat?  For your trailer 2- 15 watt panels will put enough back in during the week when you're not there, for your boat, genny is the answer, or take them home."
769744,Terry,2013-02-23 21:33:00,14456,-if you can't run an ex cord to the boat from the trailer the easiest  way is quick connects on the batteries and charge them at the trailer  a second set of batteries helps too
769748,Fisherman,2013-02-23 21:49:00,7201,He said there's no shore power..a.k.a. commercial hydro.
769751,Roy,2013-02-23 22:08:00,13728,"I'm willing to bet that he meant ""dock power"" as a trailer park without power is only a parking lot."
769762,Fisherman,2013-02-23 22:35:00,7201,"Haha, I'll have to wait on the verdict.  Where we camp it's ""no shore power"" and even on most all RV/trailer websites, No Shore Power means you're ""boondocking"" or no commercial power available."
769763,Roy,2013-02-23 22:40:00,13728,Well you got me on that one Erich. I've never used a trailer park so maybe you're right.
769766,lew,2013-02-23 22:52:00,12766,Guess I was one of the  spoiled ones as I had the  owner of our trailer park install my own private outlet right at the end of my dock.  Sure made life easy when it came to charging boat batteries every night.
769773,Muskieman,2013-02-23 23:24:00,2472,Park your car and boost it ... I've done that for the past 3 yrs ... works fine despite contrary opinions .. I do the same with my boat ... 80$ solar panel for rainy days .
769776,archer379,2013-02-23 23:40:00,277,Sorry the park has electricity at the sites but nothing down at the docks seems like my best option may be to built a wagon and haul then back to the trailer to charge maybe 2 more batteries
