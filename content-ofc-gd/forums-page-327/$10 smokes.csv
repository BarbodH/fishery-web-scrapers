769227,mcdougy,2013-02-21 01:50:00,274,"I am in the process of quitting smoking!!! I have been 3.5 weeks without any, and have 7 weeks left on the champix. Here is my plan after that: Since the tasty export gold's were going down a pack a day that was basically $10 a day. I plan on taking a trip to the tackle shops once a day on the way home from work and buy me a 10$ lure every day for the first month at least. I think its a great plan to get the boys boxes filled up with dads lures. So im going to ask for opinions/suggestions on some must haves. The first targets are sm bass walleyes and pike. Thats 10 lures for each species at least.  Help me out folks.  Matt"
769228,Handlebarz,2013-02-21 01:57:00,3790,That sounds like a awesome idea and good reward to extend your life.
769230,mcdougy,2013-02-21 02:00:00,274,"Thats the plan!!! Wear the blades right off this prop, with my boys of course.  Matt"
769234,Twocoda,2013-02-21 02:09:00,4130,clakin raps....first the original shad colour...then white...then blue silver ...then perch..then green ...and you can use them in the fall too for salmon and bows if you take the boys for some late night pier chucking..
769235,bigmac1984,2013-02-21 02:13:00,193,"A white spinnerbait is a good choice for the SM bass and the pike. Get yourself some crankbaits for all 3 of those species. Live target, strike king, any of them are good. As mentioned, husky jerks are good too.  I never leave home without a spinner bait, and I catch all kinds of SM bass and pike. I'm not a great walleye fisherman so I'll leave that advice to someone else! lol"
769236,Nipfisher,2013-02-21 02:15:00,2449,You need to get some harnesses and spinners for trolling and drifting. Buy a flat of worms too.
769237,Rod Caster,2013-02-21 02:15:00,5784,"And casting in 5-15fow for walleye. Its a blast knocking these baits off bottom, especially with a boulder bottom! Could work for ice fishing too.  You'll have a nice collection of tackle for your boys at the end of this month."
769238,pidge,2013-02-21 02:16:00,438,"Ive recently have moved off the big hard baits and now chuck soft plastics all day long. I'm able to catch multiple species with the mr.twisters (black with black head, black body with silver tail and black jig head, chartruse with chartruse head, worm brown with a black jig head) and have also gotten into 6"" soft worms of all kinds of different varity. I've got me a pretty big collection as I'm sure most of the members do around here, but in the last 2 years I cant get away from the mr.twisers and soft worms. But if its something else your looking for Spinner Baits work great for pike and bass. I've had good luck with white skirts and also golden with black skirts. Rapala has some pretty good hard baits know as ""X-raps"" Ive had reall good luck with all sizes of those mainly in perch pattern and blue with white belly. Who knows though..in a another year I may go totally different and start using crank baits. For me its what produces most and for now its the softies. Good luck and post up with what you decide. Oh and good luck with the no smoking. Me next...I hope."
769241,danc,2013-02-21 02:23:00,4677,"Too bad you didn't smoke Cuban cigars. You could have had 50 bucks a day to spend on tackle. Good luck with the program, and I hope you fill your tackle box nicely."

769623,spincast,2013-02-23 00:07:00,3279,good for you. I quit when they were $1.25 for a small pack at Macs Milk ( always said I would quit when they cost $1.00 per pack). you'd be surprised what you can do with the free cash flow 
769695,mcdougy,2013-02-23 14:46:00,274,Nice Setup!!!!!
769700,Roy,2013-02-23 15:17:00,13728,"Yes, a great setup. $1.25 a small pack eh? When I started smoking, a large pack (25) was 42 cents. I remember the cost because it happened that regular gas was also 42 cents a gallon."
