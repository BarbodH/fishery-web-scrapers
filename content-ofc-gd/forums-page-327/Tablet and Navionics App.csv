770078,Angler management,2013-02-25 17:11:00,280,"Im the opposite, i have only used cable motors... Never had the opportunity to try the electric ones, and all i have ever heard about them was bad( by bass boat guys). Beacause they dont hold direction through thick weeds and current... I just bought a new Foretexx only cuz i heard those models were no good in heavy weeds. Do you have any of those problems?"
770085,BillM,2013-02-25 17:36:00,17367,"Terrova isn't installed on the boat yet   Although I've had various Powerdrive units, never an issue with them.  I'm not a hardcore bass fisherman anyhow, so I doubt my info would be helpful."
770107,BucktownAngler,2013-02-25 19:51:00,582, dont think the ipad handles direct sunlight and heat very well.
769752,wkrp,2013-02-23 22:13:00,656,I am considering buying a Samsung tab 2 10.1 tablet and downloading the navionics app to be used as a GPS. Anyone have any experience with this?
769812,ccmtcanada,2013-02-24 01:45:00,7971,"I have an ipad2 with the navionics app on it.  You would need a data connectivity plan or tether data from a phone to the tablet in order for you to use it.  I have used it in the past without connectivity for simple lake maps.  Now that I have an iphone, it's easy to tether the data to it using remote hotspot."
769814,kickingfrog,2013-02-24 01:56:00,8333,I have the app for my android phone. It works great on that. Best 15 bucks I've ever spent on tech.
769819,Christopheraaron,2013-02-24 02:26:00,3525,Just bought it for my iPhone yesterday and it worked well today
769822,Canuck,2013-02-24 03:08:00,491,"I have it on an iPAD too. First an iPAD 1 and now the 3. It works well. It's more accurate with a wifi version. Screen is hard to see in bright sunlight but its ok. There is an upgrade that is a bit extra that gives you more navigation features.  It works faster than my Raymarine C80. It's a great backup for my main gps and great for the admiral looking ahead at the course while the main one is used for driving.  If you use it as your main gps, get a waterproof case and some way to power it from the boat."
769836,wkrp,2013-02-24 12:15:00,656,Apparently you dont need data connectivity if the tablet has GPS.
769873,bassjnkie,2013-02-24 16:38:00,1101,"You will need data to refresh the map, just like Google navigation."
769920,BillM,2013-02-24 19:02:00,17367, Unless you save the maps for offline browsing..  This is the only way to get around using Google Maps without a data connection.
769938,jedimaster,2013-02-24 21:02:00,3472,I have navionics on my galaxy s3. Works awesome.
769942,captpierre,2013-02-24 21:46:00,2521,"Not a techie here, but using Pads/phones is using cell towers to triangulate and locate your location, correct?  Is it as accurate as real satelite GPS?  peter"
769943,ccmtcanada,2013-02-24 21:47:00,7971, Phones and tablets now a days actually have gps capabilities...not using cell phone towers to triangulate.
769960,Lunatic,2013-02-24 23:46:00,536,i bought it for my iphone last week because i dont have the money for the hot maps for the fish finder. cant wait to use it. looks good so far just playing around with it abit.
769962,Angler management,2013-02-25 00:00:00,280,"I have the navionics HD app. For my new ipad. Its great for use as a backup or secondary map, however the maps are not as accurate, and most of the northern lakes down show u any detail or depth. Also cell phone service is hard to come by further up north so i wouldnt rely on accurate gps as well"
769989,Canuck,2013-02-25 01:34:00,491,The iPads use real internal GPS and then augment it with the 3G or LTE to speed up and make it a bit more accurate. The 3G or LTE is needed to download maps while off wifi. It's pretty accurate in my experience.
769992,captpierre,2013-02-25 01:49:00,2521,now I feel kinda dumb that a spent $1K+ on my HDS 7
769995,Canuck,2013-02-25 02:11:00,491," IPAD has no sonar, isn't waterproof. It's a nice to have kind of thing."
770000,BillM,2013-02-25 02:29:00,17367," iPad isn't going to replace your HDS7, don't worry about it."
770027,Angler management,2013-02-25 12:01:00,280,"The new hds units can connect with iphone and ipad and give u full control of the unit using an app. Amazing idea! Now i can floor-mount my massive ipad at the bow of the boat, and get a HDS-12 size monitor for free..."
770031,BillM,2013-02-25 13:07:00,17367," Don't hit any waves because that screen will crack in no time, lol.  You also need the $250 wireless module if I'm not mistaken."
770045,Angler management,2013-02-25 14:15:00,280,
770051,BillM,2013-02-25 14:50:00,17367," Yup, or you can just get a swivel mount for your current sonar"
770057,Angler management,2013-02-25 15:05:00,280,"I was thinking the same thing, but a 7"" screen is too small to view from bow, especially when viewing really fine imaging from structure scan... Could just wire everything up and just use same unit in both spots"
770063,BillM,2013-02-25 15:16:00,17367,"I've got that problem in my Lund (can't swivel my graph because of the windshield).. Drives me crazy because I'm constantly asking the oldman how deep it is, lol!    Once I get a new Terrova installed with US2, I'll be dropping a Humminbird 747c upfront and will never have to ask the oldman for depth again  As long as you don't destroy the iPad in the process, sounds like a killer way to get data up to the front of the boat."
770070,Angler management,2013-02-25 15:51:00,280,
770071,BillM,2013-02-25 15:56:00,17367, Terrova is a standard foot pedal type motor.  I've never use a cable setup like you see on a lot of bass boats.
