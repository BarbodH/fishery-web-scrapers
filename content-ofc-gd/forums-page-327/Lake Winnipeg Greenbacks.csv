Although stay away from permanent shacks...drifts on the south side of these were nearing 5'...could be dangerous in not paying attention.Saturday I was with a group fishing under a special permit to fill up the Mid Canada Boat Show Lund Mega Tank, Manitoba Fisheries granted a special permit to retain these fish for educational purposes at the show next weekend. Through a lot of hard work by a number of folks this venture is pulled off every year in fine form and fish handling and health is paramount.We concentrated on 8-10' of water under the ice, which is approaching 48"" in many locations. Rattle baits were the ticket and saw a number of fish come in super aggressive, like lake trout, chasing the bait all over the water column. Around noon the bite slowed to a crawl, fish were still looking but less interested in eating. Downsizing to a 1/4 and 1/8oz Lindy Frostee spoon tipped with a minnow head iced a few more fish before we called it a day mid afternoon.March is going to be on fire on Big Windy, if you are considering catching the fish of a lifetime, this is the time to do it, as warmer weather facilitates mobility...which will make you successful."
