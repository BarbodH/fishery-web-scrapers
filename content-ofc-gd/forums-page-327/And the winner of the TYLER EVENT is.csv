769781,tapout,2013-02-23 23:58:00,166,"Was a great day indeed Brian.  Was great to see you again and was great to finally meet Terry even though he almost drove over my ice fishing gear with the sled as you guys were on the way out   Was great to see Joey and Paul again, bigchev, Kelvin - Great job with the bbq  , and the other ofner's I talked to but can't remember their names at the moment, but most of all it was great to finally meet Tyler's Mom, Tyler's sister, and Tyler himself.  Was a great day and look forward to next year for sure.  My nephew had a great time and is looking forward to going out with me again. We spotted ourselves in the group pic and not surprisingly I'm by the bbq ordering a couple burgers when you snapped this pic.   As for our luck we managed 2 perch with mine being about 4 - 5 inches and my nephews perch coming in at 9 inches.  We basically took a few minnows for a swim.  .   I still have a ton, pretty much all my minnows left and Virginia Beach beckons for tomorrow's am.  Tony."
