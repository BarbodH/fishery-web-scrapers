With the weather being so cold and not wanting to bring it out for the first time in frigid temps I have been waiting, waiting and waiting. I finally got out with it with the warmer temps.  Was a tough morning of fishing I put in but I was able to hook into a couple. Again, I can't thank Chris enough. I have never fished such a nice rod and could never have done so with out his help.  Here is a picture of the first fish hooked on the new rod. Not a monster but still fun haha.   I am currently keeping my eye open for a better reel to match the rod haha.  Chris. "
