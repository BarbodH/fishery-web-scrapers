What is also weird is the kill switch will not shut the machine off after pull starting, AND the ignition key will not shut it off, All the wires seem tight,  Any thoughts are appreciated as we have guests visiting from PEI  Blizz"
769914,nancur373,2013-02-24 18:44:00,1211,ignition is unhooked

769923,Sandbag,2013-02-24 19:05:00,533,"I believe that you will find that one of the ground wires has come off.  I had the same problem with a Polaris.  If memory serves me, the ground wire was on the Mag side of the engine and down low near the mounts.  Once that was hooked back up, kill switch functions properly.  As for the starter not engaging, sound like a different problem all together if it is spinning but not engaging...  Good luck, let us know how you make out  Cheers  Craig"
769924,archer379,2013-02-24 19:54:00,277,There is the main plug on the wiring harness there is also one other wire that has a micky mouse type connection on it sounds like its lose
769954,Pigeontroller,2013-02-24 23:19:00,2793,A Polaris is not a Ski-doo...Just sayin
769963,Fisherman,2013-02-25 00:10:00,7201,Never..
770006,mr blizzard,2013-02-25 03:06:00,1589,"Sandbag and Purenewf you were right on the money, even with the snow falling we were able to blow the snow off and trace the wiring and at minus 50 windchills I know I can start a Polaris, my neighbour has a skidoo........he does not have the same bragging rights .........arctic tested.......  even on a pull start lol but true."
770020,porkpie,2013-02-25 05:10:00,2521,"With respect to the starter not elevating to engage the flywheel, I had a 96 mariner 30hp outboard with this same issue in cold weather.  I would sometimes have to stick a screwdriver under it and push up while hitting the starter... Always interesting!  A complete disassembly and degrease, followed up by light oil lube was the eventual cure.  I guess there was some grease in there that gummed up badly in cold weather????  As for the wiring, I have no idea sorry."
770068,capt_hooked,2013-02-25 15:40:00,212,skidoo is a generic term used my us old-timers...  show some respect...!

770122,Terry,2013-02-25 20:42:00,14456,yup  skidoo  = snow machine kleenex  = tissue paper jacuzzi = hot tub pickerel = walleye blonde =   .........
770128,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-25 20:54:00,10439,But to the Pepsi generation this is a snow machine!!    Skidoo = Snow Mobile
770130,jim,2013-02-25 20:58:00,124,My 50 Merc sometimes won't engage.  Spray the bendix with some WD40.  Always worked for me!
