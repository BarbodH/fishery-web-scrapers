769629,davey buoy,2013-02-23 00:43:00,5505,"Just dug out my 25 year old camping stove.Very similar to the one shown. shown.CT has the Coleman fuel(white gas)on for $19.99 a gallon. Heard through the grapevine people are using unleaded gas in these at about $5.85 a gallon. Anyone tried that in there stoves?. Did a couplle searches and apparently gasoline or white gas,or Kerosene can be used in them..Huge difference in price,but don't want to have a explosion either using something I shouldn't. Thanks. "
769635,bigbuck,2013-02-23 01:12:00,2449,"You can't use kerosene in them. Unleaded would work but be careful, for the amount of fuel it uses, just get the Coleman fuel."
769636,Fisherman,2013-02-23 01:16:00,7201,"That particular model looks like the dual fuel one. You can use regular unleaded in them.  I have the same larger one and 2 dual fuel lanterns, both work on unleaded, NO Kerosene."
769637,davey buoy,2013-02-23 01:19:00,5505,There must be a good reason for using there fuel. The flashpoint may not be as high as gas?.Therefore safer. Was just curious..I don't mind the cost so much as like you say it lasts a long time.
769638,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-23 01:23:00,10439,White gas burns cleaner so you will have less issues with the burners and orifice clogging up.
769639,davey buoy,2013-02-23 01:23:00,5505,Mine being 20 plus years old may not be dual fuel?. How would I know?
769644,Old Man,2013-02-23 02:12:00,822,Tank colour. The dual fuel tanks were silver. Regular naptha tank was red.
769719,davey buoy,2013-02-23 16:49:00,5505,"Thanks for clearing that up.Picked up a Coleman blend bottle.Apparently there getting away from the Naptha container,as so I'm told.Says it works in all Coleman stoves.By the way,mine is the red tank."
769739,Tootsie II,2013-02-23 20:38:00,162,We started buying and using 92 octane fuel for our red tank 3 burner coleman stove last year. We've had no problems with it so far.
769746,davey buoy,2013-02-23 21:45:00,5505,now yours would be a older stove as well?.I'm just worried why they changed to the silver tank and call it a dual fuel stove.
769747,Fisherman,2013-02-23 21:47:00,7201,The dual fuel models have a different generator unit which allows the use of unleaded and naphtha.  Red tanks can only use naphtha.
