768958,pidge,2013-02-20 01:37:00,438,"Hey Bill I shoulda worded that a little better lol. I meant it to read different, but its okay. Thanks Drifter thats more of what I ment. I know sometimes its hard to word posts:) I'll shoot them an email shortley."
768959,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-20 01:42:00,10439,Most of the charters do 2 trips a day. A morning trip and an afternoon/evening trip.
768967,BillM,2013-02-20 01:55:00,17367," Ryan and Dan are good guys, you'll have an great time if you get out on the water with them."
768973,pidge,2013-02-20 02:07:00,438,Thanks Bill for the heads up.
769045,Fishmaster,2013-02-20 14:26:00,920,http://www.fishmastersultimatecharters.com  we have a new boat coming this year that will hold up to 10 guys also ...Niagara is awesome for Kings and lots of them in August also a OFC discount Full Day 8 Hours
769047,Harrison,2013-02-20 14:40:00,2202,Lots of great referals.  IF that is your timeframe I'd be picking from the Bluffs over to Credit area. Especially if you wait til the latter part of the month
769127,rhare,2013-02-20 21:19:00,387,"Hey Thanks for the kind words guys!! We work hard to make it a fun trip.   The reason we started doing 5 hour trips this year is beacuse we are running out of Bluffers and basically all the big boats there run 5 hour trips. Longer trips can be arranged. Just ask  The fishing along the North Shore of Lake Ontario and particularly along the Toronto city line is amazing in the summer months. Its just doesnt get any better anywhere on the lake.  Lots of great guys mentioned in this post, enjoy its a great fishery!  Ryan Hare "
769144,Lungelarry,2013-02-20 22:17:00,294,"If you decide to get greedy(more fish for you to reel in),http://getbit.ca/     Capt. Gavin will take up to 3 guys in his 21ft. Ranger,which he trailers to the best hotspots."
769181,irishfield,2013-02-20 23:51:00,26272,Captain Gavin... can't help but chuckle.. in a nice way! lol  
769400,Lungelarry,2013-02-21 23:11:00,294,Gavin said you were the guide that day............lol
768262,danbouck,2013-02-16 17:52:00,4380,"Hey Guys,  I need help finding a Lake Ontario Salmon Charter for August. Can anyone recommend one. Any location on Lake O is fine."
768265,Roy,2013-02-16 18:08:00,13728,"Man, there are hundreds of them Dan! I can't help you but I'm positive that someone here can. One of their questions will be ""For how many people?"" Good luck."
768266,danbouck,2013-02-16 18:15:00,4380,There are tons. I'm sure people will help with some past experiences.  Looking for 4-6 people
768273,irishfield,2013-02-16 18:27:00,26272,Lloyd.... at tad tight for 6 though..
768274,mike rousseau,2013-02-16 18:40:00,4661,Fishing4tails  Greg Amiel  Awesome time in August...  We landed 16/21 with him biggest was just over 28lbs
768275,danbouck,2013-02-16 19:07:00,4380,That's my first choice but it would be tight with 6
768276,bigbuck,2013-02-16 19:14:00,2449,"I would have said support Lloyd a fellow ofnr. But, it would be tight, no fun. Try Eddie of Square Tail charters out of Port Credit, he is a great guy and gets into the bigguns."
768277,Roy,2013-02-16 19:19:00,13728,"And an added thought Dan, you've been paying forward here for so long that it probably would be a good time for a member of the community to pay it forward also...... just sayin'"
768278,Steve,2013-02-16 19:24:00,2075,"square tails is a great charter out of credit.  he would fit 6 no problem and catches big fish.  if its corporate, and impressing customers is more important than catching tons of fish (which with business it often is), I'd go with Wayne Andrews. His big business charters are tough to beat!"
768293,krixxer,2013-02-16 21:34:00,274,In august I think you would want to go out to the bluffs  PC gets a lot of action but it seems that it comes on a bit later in the season.  I've also noticed that they get bigger fish out there in the early part of the season.
768294,danbouck,2013-02-16 21:37:00,4380,I am not picky about the date. I just need very big fish and lots of them!
768296,Steve,2013-02-16 21:41:00,2075,"lots of guys can do that...but many of those guys are ""mobile"" (smaller boats that go from port to port), which aren't going to be big enough for your party.  if lots of fish/big fish was your goal, I'd go in April out of Port Dalhousie.  best time of the year for pissed off kings...  a 20lbs april king would pull around and man handle a 30lbs july king."
768326,miller,2013-02-16 23:23:00,223,Fin-tastic Sportfishing or Reel Wild are in the Niagara region. Fintastic runs out of Grimsby and Reel Wild runs out of Jordan I believe.
768337,Gallie,2013-02-17 01:13:00,1215,Definitely go to the bluffs. Thats where we fish the derby july and august and it puts out some monsters.
768341,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-17 01:36:00,10439,Fishy Business out of Port Credit.
768344,John Bacon,2013-02-17 01:58:00,3277,"Vito Cirone at 416-580-9530  I haven't fished with him personally, but he does have a good reputation.  I think he was used catch the salmon for tagging back when they had the million dollar salmon."
768365,fishhunter,2013-02-17 03:31:00,604,Pm sent
768578,Jimmay,2013-02-18 13:06:00,4,"It all depends on when in August.  Early August, it could be ok but as the time goes on the fish begin to move in front of where they were strocked and many head back US side. Tonns of good guys out there .  6 people you will want a good size.  Talk to them right away when you are booking and say you want salmon and not bows and they can tell u the best time."
768639,BillM,2013-02-18 20:24:00,17367,"Give Ryan and Dan a call at We Pound'em fishing...   Ryan is a board member, great guys, always on the fish.  http://www.wepoundemfishing.com/"
768763,Bondar,2013-02-19 06:06:00,817,"X 2 great guys , and lots of big fish"
768764,kenzy31,2013-02-19 10:41:00,261,"X3, big fish and plenty of them! You won't be disappointed"
768811,Loadman,2013-02-19 16:17:00,63,Square Tails is Ed and Vito with Lord of the Kings.... both awsome... both friends gimme a pm and we can chat and possibly get you a deal
768948,pidge,2013-02-20 00:58:00,438,"Just checked out ""wepoundthem"". It says 5 hours, morning or evening. Is that what you'll typically find with these salmon charter guys?  Looks like a fun time though."
768950,BillM,2013-02-20 01:05:00,17367, Morning and evenings are usually the best times to be out on the lake.
768953,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-20 01:27:00,10439,I know most of the guys on the river in Pt. Credit do 6 hour charters.  Unless things have changed since I left.
