764744,muskeybugged,2013-02-02 23:08:00,282,"Removing shingles is a piece of mind sort of thing. If you can inspect underside of roof from attic for water damage, do it. If there is no to little damage strap'er to the shingles. Comparing it to a moldy bathroom/shower,  once it dries out and is not used mold ceases to multiply. Metal Roofing will ensure this does not get wet - further ensuring no mold growth.  We are talking a camp, not a home nor a cottage?  Structure is enhanced with a metal roof. Visiting the Caribbean this metal roofing is used quite often and seems to be holding structure together.  Pricing, the Mennonite's seem to control the pricing. Forcing local business to compete in Mennonite regions. can't remember exact $ figures though but way cheaper then Toronto prices. Price in the snow guards! That single peak is going to make for a slow install.  Make sure you have your spider legs when walking on a metal roof."
764809,Rich Nelson,2013-02-03 01:21:00,332, Thats because the roofers make good cash stripping off the old shingles. It is not required.
764894,ch312,2013-02-03 15:01:00,1590," No, its because reputable roofers would rather do the job properly the first time so they will have piece of mind knowing they won't have to come back to repair the expensive roof they just installed. Some contractors do care about their reputation and not everything is about $$$.  Out of curiosity, how might one guarantee a metal shingle roof if they're not exactly sure what's under the shingles and a waterproof membrane can't be installed? The membrane isn't highly recommended and even a requirement for some contractors ""just because"".  A couple home inspectors I know have seen their fair share of $15k+ metal roofs that had to be ripped off because they were nothing more than bandaids...  "

764935,lew,2013-02-03 18:45:00,12766, My neighbor has a steel roof and doesn't have the tabs. The snow builds up and then everything lets go at once and hits the ground like a freight train. If anybody was standing below it they wouldn't be found till springtime
769466,mcdougy,2013-02-22 02:18:00,274,"I have installed many many many steel roofs in my career.  Not once in a situation like yours have we ever taken the old shingles off.  The only instance you would take them off is: if there is way too many layers on to start, meaning that the roof is caveing in to start. Generally we just use 1x4 rough strap nailed to rafter. metal overtop. As far as cost I would estimate approx. 1/3 more initial cost vs. shingles, however you have a product that should last 100 years or more if you keep the paint to it. Some valid points on here about fast sliding snow at doorways and stuff . there are some simple products to remedy that.  I think where some of the different opinions are coming from are caused by what style of metal roof. For a cottage application I assume you are talking about a product like VicWest profile similar to Supervic(sheets). Where as some people are referring to the very architectaul looking metal (shingle look). I personally stay away from that style because of business reasons.(getting product 12 years from now and they are out of business) . A recent change in metal is a trend towards lighter guage (29) and it is high tensile. Again IMO I am still using the old standard 28 guage. If someone asked me to put steel on a simple roofline  like the one you are explaing (cottage) I would say ok. If someone has a steep roof with alot of valleys I would say no way. Water runs super fast on metal and sealing at valleys can be a challenge that i stay away from personally.   Any other advice I can give, I will.  Matt"

763787,bushart,2013-01-30 17:04:00,2628,if you strap over the existing shingles and put metal on that---the old roof dampens the sound a bit
763805,F7Firecat,2013-01-30 18:39:00,347,"Never put a metal roof over a existing asphalt shingle roof, strip off the old roof theres too much weight when you consider a layer (or two) of asphalt shingles, strapping and metal roofing. Especially on  camp roof that in the winter may see a large amount of snow load, with no one there to shovel it off when needed."
763829,Muskieman,2013-01-30 19:55:00,2472,"Strip old singles off , apply self sealing waterproof membrane , steel roof ... never to be touched again ... looks great , sounds even better under rainy skies ."
763833,Oggie,2013-01-30 20:12:00,588,It's a good pitch so I was kind of hoping the snow would break free every now and then to reduce the snow load.  If I have to remove the old shingles I might just go with shingles again. It's a 70 year old log structure so the metal roof would outlive the life of the building. dan O.
763846,tb4me,2013-01-30 20:32:00,3295,Couldnt have said it any better myself right here....
763871,bushart,2013-01-30 21:08:00,2628,Strapping and the metal's weight is negligible overall if your concerned about it  We strapped over our cottage roof (Shingles)--15 years ago---put metal over that---zero issues---between North Bay and Huntsville---l'il bit of snow---no shovelling  Look at the area for snow loads-----look at the Sault where some roofs have 3 feet of snow on them------  Who's shoveling your cottage roof now with just shingles??---fall in yet?---snow likely sticks on those shingles as well  That metal is not as heavy as you think---try hanging onto one sheet on a windy day----ultimately your call.  If it's a cottage style roof----whats the pitch---7/12?---if so snow comes off quickly  try walking on one with metal  I would not apply metal directly to shingles though.
763885,bushart,2013-01-30 21:35:00,2628,"this info taken off a metal roofing website.......

763909,F7Firecat,2013-01-30 22:32:00,347,lmao  i guess i better search the internet to find instructions on why not to leave shingles on the roof.  cut and paste.......must be an engineer  LOL  gotta love it........ next!!!  only reason to leave shingles on a roof and go over with metal is  1. your too cheap to pay someone to strip it off 2. your too lazy to do it yourself  do it once do it right

You can't put it over shingles , do it once do it right .. The steel roof would be the last roof that that cottage will ever see ."
763960,bushart,2013-01-31 00:59:00,2628,All this expertise  Yes you can put them over shingles  Who cares if there's rot underneath them  The strapping will grab every truss above the shingles and be the support for the metal roof  Not the plywood or boards underneath the shingle  If there's a concern that the trusses are comprimised---a quick trip into the attic space will determine-----if there's a truss problem---re-roofing of any kind won't help
763964,Muskieman,2013-01-31 01:19:00,2472,I meant that you can't put a membrane on top of shingles . I would for sure care about rot ...I wouldn't put Bondo or a sticker over the rusty spots on my truck ..    *edit impaired typos. .

763975,Oggie,2013-01-31 02:10:00,588,"Thanks guys.  Bushart my camp is on the same latitude as yours. The roof has never been shovelled so metal would be an improvement especially once the warm, sunny days of March show up.  I hesitate to remove the shingles because they can't be disposed of any where nearby (I'm in the Park).  They'd need to be trucked to Pembroke which is 50 miles away down a gravel road. The roof doesn't leak and I figured the existing shingles would be as good as a membrane underneath once the metal is installed. I would strap the roof first for sure.   Anyone have any idea as to cost for metal vs asphalt? I'm hearing double the asphalt cost to get a rough estimate. Thanks again.  Dan O.

764007,John Bacon,2013-01-31 04:53:00,3277,"Adding a metal roof over shingles should reduce the weight load, not increase it.  Snow doesn't stick to a metal roof; the strapping and metal will be lighter than the snow that sticks to shingles.  I was never bothered by the noice on my parent's cottage which had a metal roof over shingles.  My brother doesn't seem to have an issue with noice at his cottage which has a metal roof with no decking.  My parents went with large metal sheets over strapping on top of the existing shingles.  I did notice more bugs in the cottage after that.  I would look at metal shingles instead of the large sheets.  You should also remove the gutters from your roof if you go with metal; other wise the snow will take them off.  I have seen some roofs with metal ""brakes"" installed to slow the speed that the snow slides off the roof."
764008,rickster,2013-01-31 05:07:00,495,Not sure of prices your way but up here lifetime architectural shingles sell for 28 dollars a bundle  and colored metal sells for about 95 cents a square foot so pretty close in price
764113,Oggie,2013-01-31 19:18:00,588,Thanks for the info guys.  Some great points that I hadn't even thought about. Dan O.
764566,ch312,2013-02-02 14:04:00,1590,"  Oddly enough, nearly every professional roofer around here removes shingles before installing the metal shingles. Have you much experience with installing metal roofs?  Considering the costs involved, maybe it would be beneficial to seek advice from a reputable metal roof installer?     "
764570,scotty61,2013-02-02 14:24:00,3,"Just me 2 cents worth. If you planning on doing it youself, metal sheets can be ordered in any length you want. However if your roof come to a single point, there will be a lot of cutting involved, unlike a standard 2 sided roof.  Like Johnbacon mentioned, snow brakes or cleats are a must before any roof protrusions like chimneys, antenaes etc.  Once the snow releases, it comes down fast and hard, wiping out anything in its path. (Don't ask how I know this  ).   Nice to have them over the entrance too, if you use the camp during the winter. Once the snow falls it packs down pretty hard. ...Scotty"
