768970,irishfield,2013-02-20 02:00:00,26272,If not... could you call the MOE and ask why not?? Thanks!
768972,pidge,2013-02-20 02:05:00,438,oh man
768975,irishfield,2013-02-20 02:09:00,26272,"To think... an airplane kinda sank there a couple years back and it was a declared an emergency... water intake shut down ( that is 30 feet down and AV Gas floats).. absorb booms, you name it at extreme expense. Dunk a diesel filled hoe... not a sign of any thing to soak things up. Hope the municipality is holding a large retainer...."
768978,irishfield,2013-02-20 02:14:00,26272,Not sure how it turned out. Definitely ran out of lift at that point. I know the ground the excavator is parked on is not flat.. and you can see it's not far off nosing in. Cable is attached to something... but won't do anything if it rolls right.
768981,Rod Caster,2013-02-20 02:18:00,5784,"Whoa. Who did it and call MOE-SAC, they will tighten some screws.1800-286-6060. The squeeky wheel will get the grease. At minimum they should have had tons of absorbants at hand, a marine curtain and a vac truck on site, especially if there was any pure diesel leaking out.  Ministry of Labour might be interested in that one too. I am associated in no way with this one! haha. I'm driving up that way tomorrow morning for another fuel spill, I think I'll be taking a gander at this one."
768983,Joey,2013-02-20 02:27:00,9122,"Jeez, didn't a plow go through last year too.  Them fish are gonna be Tasteeeeeeeeeeee"
768984,Rod Caster,2013-02-20 02:28:00,5784,"Hopefully, for everyone, the fuel supply stayed intact and closed. Just called the MOE and it was reported at 11:45 this morning. I'm sure one of the North Bay Officers took a drive out."
768986,irishfield,2013-02-20 02:39:00,26272,Thanks for checking on it Chad... gotta love this network!!
769104,Rod Caster,2013-02-20 20:02:00,5784,"Ya, it looks alright there. Scary for the driver I'm sure!"
769168,irishfield,2013-02-20 23:27:00,26272,Thanks!
769170,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-20 23:32:00,10439,Where is Hoein Lake?
769214,Rod Caster,2013-02-21 01:10:00,5784,Right beside Lake X (cavator)
769217,Nipfisher,2013-02-21 01:15:00,2449,I heard today they hooked up a dozer to the excavator to pull out the backhoe.
769223,Nipfisher,2013-02-21 01:45:00,2449,"""I don't know why?""  That is exactly what I was thinking when I typed it out. LMAO"
769225,Rod Caster,2013-02-21 01:46:00,5784,
769692,Muskieman,2013-02-23 14:24:00,2472,"The company is MX Construction out of Sturgeon Falls, they were hired to fix the docks , the owner of MX was out in BC buying a helicopter at the time , he's not a happy man , under no circumstance were they to take that backhoe onto the ice ."
769716,Nipfisher,2013-02-23 16:34:00,2449,Story is....they drilled holes the day before to check the thickness and determined it was safe for the backhoe. With the weight of the backhoe the water came up through the drilled holes and made the ice heavy causing the backhoe to sink through.
769728,Steve,2013-02-23 18:03:00,2075,hope that company has ice / skeg cover for their equipment or they are crap out of luck!
