I have had little time to meet new people due to my responsibilities.... and have been using fishing as my time away.,.... time for myself....  So if there are any OFC members within say 75kms from Brighton that could use a bit of company while fishing etc.... I am all ears! I will pay for my fair share should a boat be used etc..... I just have to get out there!!! and company is nice from time to time...  Please PM me... or reply to this thread should you have an opening...   G."
