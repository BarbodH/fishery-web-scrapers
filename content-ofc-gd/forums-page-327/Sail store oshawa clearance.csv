769552,Angler management,2013-02-22 20:25:00,280,"Sail store in oshawa is having a no HST sale on whole top floor, and additonal 20% off all rods. (Except combos)"
769786,John Bacon,2013-02-24 00:06:00,3277,I think it is all Sail stores.  I picked up some items from the one near Bass Pro today.
769811,icefisherman,2013-02-24 01:39:00,952,Do they sell trolling rods?
769827,Steve,2013-02-24 03:23:00,2075,"yes, many shimano ones."
769835,archer379,2013-02-24 11:59:00,277,Going to hit there today
769837,lew,2013-02-24 12:17:00,12766," For anyone looking for rods at SAIL, just be sure you know what the other stores in the area  are charging for the same thing.  I bought a St. Croix Legend Tournament musky rod from Gagnons last summer for about $65 less than SAIL was charging for the same thing."
769925,Sinker,2013-02-24 20:09:00,8692,That's not usually the case Lew. Gagnons is usually a little bit more for everything.  S.
769926,kemper,2013-02-24 20:22:00,2232,"I do almost all of my shopping at SAIL now.  I like to support the little guy (in this case gagnons) but when it comes to prices for the things I buy often, Sail comes in lower.  As a University student - price means everything.  The other beauty about sale is that they seem to be having a hard time moving the top notch gear and it is deeply discounted. Quite a few fly rods in the $650-$800 range that are up to $300 off..."
769927,icefisherman,2013-02-24 20:29:00,952,"OK just came back from the Etobicoke store....limited rod selection in the trolling department...they only had 1 (ONE) Shimano TDR trolling rod. So I bought it. Got some dipsy divers and downrigger releases...not bad with the tax free.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
769930,Sharkbait22,2013-02-24 20:41:00,297,Are reels on sale too?
769948,icefisherman,2013-02-24 22:36:00,952,"Nope. Just no HST on the reels, no extra 20% off.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
769953,registerfly,2013-02-24 23:18:00,198,"both rods I got were cheaper overall than LeBarons, who is almost always the lowest price. Trolling rod I switched over to Okuma for this season and paired it with their 20 convector reel"
769958,Lunatic,2013-02-24 23:40:00,536,^this. i picked up a st.croix mojo bass rod at sail for 110.00 and foud the same rods at grimsby tackle for 89.99  i like sail for lures.....thats about it. ill stick to local shops and bass pro (spring classic) for rods and reels
