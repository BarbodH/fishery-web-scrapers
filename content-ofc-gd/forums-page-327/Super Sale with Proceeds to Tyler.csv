769309,TJQ,2013-02-21 16:15:00,7806,"Due to some personal family issues I will have to attend to on Saturday, looks like ill not be making the trip the the Tyler Event this year.  So I've shipped off a bunch of stuff to Elisa for the prize table.  But hey why stop there... so from now till tomorrow noon I'm gonna reduce my flat shipping rate to 5 bucks and donate 10 percent of my gross sales to Fishing for Tyler.  If you haven't donated yet, and/or are not going to the event, this is a great way to get some good tackle and support a worthy cause (and yes.. lol. help me move some inventory.)  Have a look around, ill be adding stuff all day.  http://www.duenorthfishinglures.com    "
