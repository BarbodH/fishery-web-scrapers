We were hoping to get a few for the dinner table, but caught only small ones all day about 40 between the two of us(5""-6""). We used Lucky and Sons huts and stayed out over night in on of the bungalows. Next morning got up and started off on bottom again, but same as the day before...only dinks. Oh well thats the way she goes I guess. I wanted to set a tipup outside the hut, but with the temps on Thursday the hole would have froze over quickly so I opted to just set it up in the hut at about a depth of 25' or so (guesstimating) but nothing hit that in the two days we were out there. Tryed different setups and depths as well, but nada. With the rod I was 12"" off bottom slammin alot of dinks, but noting even photo worthy. Overall I estimate we were fishing in about 40-50' of water. Had a blast, and had great service from Lucky and Sons. I'd use them again. Some pics, but no fish.   My buddy enjoying it."

I don't think drilling a hole outside your hut would have changed the results any as you're still in the same general area.  Better luck next time and may you find the jumbos on your next trip up.
