I don't think I would have caught a THING if it weren't for a friendly old timer I was chatting with. He never stops moving the salted minnow that he has on a jig.  Actually, he stores his minnows in barley...doesn't like salties.  I had salties though,,,,had no trouble. I had one on a dead stick, and was jigging flashy spoons, rattling lures, etc, to bring in fish.  Not a sniff.  After the old guy iced 4 pike to my none, I decided to take his advice on moving the minnow around.  Plain jighead and a dead minnow....just bob the rod tip so the minnow doesn't sit still, and hang on!  I still switched between that and the loud lures to draw fish in,...but they weren't interested in hitting lures. As for panfish....I don't know.  Shallow water for crappies, and a long walk to the back where there is supposedly deeper water."
