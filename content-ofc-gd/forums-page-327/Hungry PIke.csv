I just cant get over it.I`ve seen pike attack bigger fish but never a bird like this, its awesome lol       I think its just matter of time before you see somebody rigging half of a bird on a treble under a bobber haha  Enjoy"

769725,Roy,2013-02-23 17:54:00,13728,It's the circle of life. Kinda like when you catch a fish or eat a bunny or a duck.
769727,Toad Hunter,2013-02-23 17:59:00,261,that gives me an idea... how are bunnies at swimming ?
769737,adempsey,2013-02-23 19:40:00,1498,Have you seen the video of the catfish eating the pigeons from the shoreline?  Pretty cool.  They almost look like sharks to me.
