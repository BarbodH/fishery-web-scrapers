769160,Locnar,2013-02-20 23:06:00,645,"Going to be going to hunting for Lakers and/or Whities... I was thinking of going to IBP and hiking out to deep waters. Any ideas on lures or bait? Anyone have any luck out there or have any better locales? (obligatory, not looking for honey holes) I'd really like to land my first laker or whitie, so any help is appreciated. Thanks fellas."

769419,Locnar,2013-02-22 00:12:00,645,"darn' eh boys, all info has been noted and is quite appreciated. If I catch anything, except for perch/herring (unless their massive), there'll be a report. Thanks again guys."

769442,Locnar,2013-02-22 01:05:00,645,"Bill, are you speaking of Lakers or Whities? If it's Lakers, I never knew they schooled..."
769445,linweir,2013-02-22 01:14:00,202,"You better go rent a hut located around Georgian Island. Good hut operators place you on fish, like Hanks, Dave's, Steve's, Time Hales, etc.  Fish are less spooky. Tip-up plus minnow work well."
769454,BillM,2013-02-22 01:50:00,17367," Lakers definitely school...   It really doesn't matter the fish though, if you punch a hole and see zero on your graph, go find some new water.  Even a move of like 20-30ft can make a difference between a skunk and a banner day.   Also don't bother dead sticking anything on a tipup, you want to get the active fish on the chase.."
769455,chris.brock,2013-02-22 01:51:00,4053," come on, we want a report, fish or no fish, it's all good info"
