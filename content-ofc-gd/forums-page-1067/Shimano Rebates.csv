Two that really stood out were Shimano Citica's for $98 and Curado D's for $168. Add in the $30 and $50 off rebates, and they are practically giving them away...  My question is this - the Shimano rebate forms that are printable online state only for U.S. residents, and it is a U.S. address you mail it to. I know that we are eligible for the rebates, so do we just send the form to the U.S. and they will honour it, or is there a mailing address here in Canada that they can be sent to?  Thanks in advance.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
173124,setomonkey,2008-03-18 18:47:00,872,"Hi Justin,  Just picked up a Citica myself. The rebate form gives the Shimano Canada address:  Shimano Canada 427 Pido Rd Peterborough, ON K9J 6X7  But I wonder if you will have any problem trying to get the rebate from Shimano Canada if you buy the reel from a U.S. dealer, as they ask which store you bought the reel from and want a photocopy of your receipt.  Mike"
