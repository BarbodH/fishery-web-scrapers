173185,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-18 21:02:00,1183,"A Russian and a Newfoundland wrestler were set  to square off for  the Olympic Gold medal.  Before the final match, the Newfie wrestler's  trainer came to him and said, ""Now, don't forget all  the research we've done on this Russian.  He's never  lost a match because of this 'pretzel' hold he has.    Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold!  If he does, you're finished"";  the Newfie nodded in  acknowledgment.  As the match started, the Newfie and the Russian  circled each other several times, looking for an  opening.  All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward,  grabbing the Newfie and wrapping him up in the dreaded  pretzel hold.    A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the  trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost.  He couldn't watch the inevitable happen.   Suddenly, there was a scream, then a cheer from the crowd  and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the  Russian go flying up in the air.  His back hit the mat with a  thud and the Newfoundlander collapsed on top of him making  the pin and winning the match.  The trainer was astounded. When he finally got his wrestler  alone, He asked, ""How did you ever get out of that hold?  No  one has ever done it before!""   The wrestler answered ""Well, I was ready to give up when  he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my  eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face.  I had nothing to lose so with my last ounce of strength I  stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as  hard as  I could.""  So the trainer exclaimed, ""That's what finished him off!""   ""Not really"" said the Newfie. ""but you'd be amazed how  strong you get when you bite your own nuts!"""
