I just got approved for a one week vacation yesterday at work so it looks like I'm good to go! The only thing I know about this lake is that it's just north of Lake Muskoka. As such, I assume that it's heavily populated and likely heavily fished as well. Can anyone tell me anything about this lake? What species of fish are there to be  had and how decent (or not!) is the fishing? Thanks in advance for any insight."

Supposed to have Walleye too but wasn't targeting them. I'll ask around work here today and see if I can add any more info. For a Lake in the Muskoka's I don't remember it being overly busy. Which is usually the norm as long as you stay off of Lake Muskoka, Lake Joe, Rosseau etc. I'll let you know what I find out and shoot you a PM.   Hookset."

He is literally around the corner from there, and is usually full of advice on who catches what, where.  I've got the number saved in my cell as 705.765.7100, but I googled it and came up with 705.765.1600."
