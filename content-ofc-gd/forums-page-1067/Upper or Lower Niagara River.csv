Never fished the Niagara before.  So my question is, Upper or Lower? What has been more productive for everyone?  Thanks guys,  Mike"

But this year the upper has produced some good sizes on the steelhead,bass and musky as well. Sooo pending on the season for sure. When are u going around?? If u can get to the lower for some steelhead if u ever have a chance in the open season u certainly wont be dissapointed those damn fish fight like salmon cause the current, either way if u hit the upper or the lower in the right season u will get into fish for sure."
