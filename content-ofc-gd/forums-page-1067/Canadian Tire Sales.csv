173286,Andrew,2008-03-19 00:46:00,54,"I was browsing their website and noticed that they had hip waders on for half price, $44.95 regular $89.99, so I went to a local store that showed inventory.  When I got there I discovered that sizes 8,9,10 were on sale but not the 11.  Now there is no premium for the size 11, they are all the same regular price, why would they not be on sale?  It seems like I'm being discriminated against because of the size of my foot!  I called their customer service and am still waiting to hear back from them about why this might be.  Is this something that goes on often?  Do other places do this?  I've never noticed this before.  I realize that some of the larger sizes have premium prices because of the extra material that may be required, but when they all have the same sticker price, how do you put one size on sale and not the other?  Andrew."
173287,Pinch,2008-03-19 00:50:00,231, Oh to be a size 11.....try even finding a 14 or 15!! lol  Doesnt make sense to me tho!
173317,muskymike,2008-03-19 01:27:00,772,"Yeah that seems more like a store mistake then anything. Does it show the 11 on sale on the site? or is there any fine print that you are missing? Either way, talk to a manager at the store, they should honor something such as this."
173340,Andrew,2008-03-19 01:53:00,54," They checked the system and said that the price is set from corporate.  The manager at the first store said he'd give it to me for $44.95, but then when we went to look for them, it was the wrong product in the box.  I then went to another CT that had stock, told the manager there everything and she wouldn't give it to me.  She said she couldnt' deviate from the pricing in her system!"
173348,muskymike,2008-03-19 01:59:00,772,Thats Bull to me. I would be bugging customer service. Especially if there is no disclaimer anywhere. Keep pluggin and hopefully they will give it to you. Where are you from?
173351,Andrew,2008-03-19 02:02:00,54,I'm in Kitchener.  If CS doesn't call me back tomorrow I'll give them a call again.
173353,irishfield,2008-03-19 02:07:00,26272,Grab another pair of socks and the size 12's. 11's and 13's are not on sale.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...08474396675848#  click the size selector
173392,SBCregal,2008-03-19 02:58:00,688,"size 11 may be common enough that they sell a whole lot of em, other sizes they may be trying to clear out?? just a guess, no clue really"
173400,douG,2008-03-19 03:12:00,2693,sbcREGAL seems to make sense.
173404,muskymike,2008-03-19 03:23:00,772,"Irish is right. Layer up, get 1 size up. It looks like thats your only option."
173407,Bernie,2008-03-19 03:26:00,3190,It's discrimination against people with large feet.   :D
173425,KyleM,2008-03-19 04:07:00,218,That manager that told you she cant deviate from the corp/computers pricing is lying to you.
173437,uglyfish,2008-03-19 07:38:00,981,"unless it says anyplace online or in the flyer under that item that there is exemptions or certain sizes are not included, they have to give it to u for the sale price."
173522,irishfield,2008-03-19 13:33:00,26272,Uglyfish...see my link! 11's and 13's are NOT on sale.
173530,Bly,2008-03-19 13:46:00,1556,"Andrew  Often smaller and larger size apparel are sold on clearance when the inventory gets to high.  The web site states that they are not on sale, thus they do not have to sell them at the sale price.   I have 2 pair of similar style waders myself and have found that it is best to go a size larger than you would normally, allows for extra socks and Hot shots when fishing in the very cold temps."
173538,Fish Farmer,2008-03-19 13:55:00,2234,"I found the same thing with tires, they only carry up to 16"", special order over 16"" you pay double."
173556,Stoty,2008-03-19 14:35:00,2910,Just like with their ice fishing sale.... CT is a joke!
173564,snag,2008-03-19 14:53:00,1932,Footists!
173611,Andrew,2008-03-19 16:18:00,54,"I guess I'll try on the 12's and as long as I""m not absolutely swimming in them, extra pairs of socks should do the trick.  For $45 though it seems like a decent deal.  Andrew."
