Harris is that it's beautiful, fairly small, and gives you a sense of privacy and seclusion.  You are in luck if you are going to try your luck at pike fishing, because they are in there for sure, along with the bass you have already mentioned.  I have heard rumours that there are pickerel in there, but I can't be certain nor confirmed.  I will leave that up to you!  Good luck and have fun!"
