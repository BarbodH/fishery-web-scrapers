I want to install a small 2pc. bathroom in my basement and need someone to run the water lines and install a drain for me. It's directly below the upstairs bathroom so everything is right there, should be fairly easy for someone who knows what they're doing. Looking for someone who'll work for cash and do it fast (I need it done yesterday  ). Before I start leafing through the yellow pages I figured I'd try here first you never know eh?"
