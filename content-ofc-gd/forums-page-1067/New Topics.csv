173386,Bernie,2008-03-19 02:54:00,3190,"Sign up at www.photobucket.com. Once signed up, you log in. Upload pictures to photobucket. Now once it is uploaded, there are 3 codes for that picture right below. If you want to post it directly to the post on OFC, hilight the  tag/code then right click and finally go to your post and right click and paste. If you have more that one picture make sure you put the copied tag/code under each other. If you put the code side by side you will make a mess."

173393,livinisfishin,2008-03-19 02:58:00,661,"Thanks for your help, lets hope i got it to work.     "
173397,douG,2008-03-19 03:06:00,2693,"Bingo.  Are we great around here or what?  If Photobucket hosts your pictures, they look a little nicer on the page.  Since you are feeling all frisky, why not give the same thing a try on Photobucket?  You still need to resize your pictures first, i think."
173406,muskymike,2008-03-19 03:25:00,772,"Ahhh this is great, Gerritt told me about this but I didnt fully understand what he meant by post them on photobucket. He never mentioned the img tag, hence my confusion. I can finally start getting some pics on here"
173408,Bernie,2008-03-19 03:28:00,3190,Photobucket will auto resize douG.
173409,douG,2008-03-19 03:29:00,2693,"You can post most pictures on the internet here on this board, by using image tags, that look like this:"

173415,Bernie,2008-03-19 03:42:00,3190,It turned out fine. Just one more hint- hit enter in between the pics to space them.
173422,livinisfishin,2008-03-19 03:48:00,661,"Thanks so much bernie, helped me out like crazy!"
