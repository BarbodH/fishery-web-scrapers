The last time this happened my computer ""vet"" told me...if it happens again I strongly suggest the old girl be put down.  Brought the new baby home last night. I like it alot but there will be a learning curve for sure. My first question to you MAC people out there. How do I take a picture I have saved in my email and make it my wallpaper? I have a nice picture of our cottage that I have used for this on a couple PC's but I can't get er done on the MAC.  Any help would be appreciated. I'm just trying to personalize the new babies room!!!"

BTW you can have several pictures and it will show them at random and at a specifie time interval if you want. Go to Itunes and click on Radio and it will stream any type of mucic you desire, mine has 294 streams."
