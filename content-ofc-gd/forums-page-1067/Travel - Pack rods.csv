173102,Lefty,2008-03-18 17:33:00,14,"Hey all  I was hoping for some feedback on this one. With the new little guy, all of a sudden the vehicle is packed a little tighter on road trips and the room that once existed to slide a rod or two is pretty much no more. I've been looking at some of the newer travel/pack rods as my thinking was it could be tucked away in a smaller space. Anyone have any recommedations as to what style is more durable the telescoping style or the 3-4 piece ones. Does anyone have any experiences with either?  Thanks  L"
173103,urbanangler1990,2008-03-18 17:37:00,933,"there are new shimano exages in telescoping and in various sizes and actions aswell, that may be pricy for u, the older version is great! 6'6 M or MH not sure, a lot cheapier aswell"
173160,tipupesox,2008-03-18 20:11:00,167,"My wife purchased me the Executive Travel Kit from Daiwa - spinning.  Rod is pretty decent and the reel is as well, I actually have been using the reel  for steelhead fishing on my noodle rod.  Here is a link: http://www.daiwa.com/TravelKit/  Tom"
173162,John,2008-03-18 20:19:00,2956,"I'm not a fan of the telescopic rods. Maybe my opinion is a leftover of what was available 20 years ago. St Croix makes a really nice 4 piece Premier. It is not cheap but I hear good things from a friend who has both the 4 wt fly rod and the spinning rod versions. They break down to roughly 20"" sections and pack in a nice compact nylon tube."
173175,huntervasili,2008-03-18 20:41:00,1604,Yea I have had problems with Telescopic rods... I would go with a 4pc. rod if you can find one. That Daiwa heartland pack rods look to be pretty decent.
173183,Canuck2fan,2008-03-18 20:57:00,1444,"I don't know your situation but if you have room for a packed rod, why wouldn't a rod protector case work for a standard rod? It would be about a foot longer but only about 10 inches across at the pouch part where the reel goes.... If that is too much you could carry the reel in a small tackle bag/box and just have 2in or 3in pvc pipe made into a container the right length to fit a 6ft to 7ft rod.... That would fit just inside the trunk taking up no room at all hardly. I made one for my 11.5 ft rods that only cost about 15 bucks, and my buddy INSISTED on running over it with his car just to prove it was indestructable I guess and he was right it was fine and so were the rods. Something to think about...."
173256,Guest lundboy,2008-03-18 23:56:00,0,"I just picked up a Shimano Exage TEXAXS2124M. $110.00  It comes with a quality carry case which is about 2' long.  Same feel as a premium 2 piece rod, and can be configured for 6'9"" for 8' using included extension.  I got it for keeping in the back of the car to fish after work when I have free time.  This rod is awesome.  Much better than the ones that come in a kit/case for $50."
173399,LundGuy,2008-03-19 03:10:00,169,"These are the two that I use, both come with carrying case. One a very small compact black case (shimano exage ax stc te travel spinning rod). The other a small green tube(St Croix TidemasterÂ® Inshore Casting Travel Rod) both come in different lengths. I use both and they are very reliable and well balanced. They vary in price. Angling Outfitters in Woodstock carries the Shimano ones .   "
173436,Anatz,2008-03-19 06:03:00,74,"I was about to ask the same question, I've had my eyes on this rod for a year since I tend to do a lot of urban fishing. It's within my budget and my experience with quantum isn't so bad.  Here's the link to le barons  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp08/fishi...rods_combos.pdf"
173466,singingdog,2008-03-19 11:01:00,1047,"I would second the PVC case for your existing rods. I did this for taking a rod on kayaking trips. A 3 1/2' section of 3"" PVC takes up no space and you can pile anything on top of it in the back of the car. It is only a foot longer than most travel rods, and bombproof."
