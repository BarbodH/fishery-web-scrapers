173284,Josh Rogers,2008-03-19 00:45:00,79,Hey everyone. How are you all? Well I managed to get a couple days off work this week and managed to go 9/14 between today and yesterday. My buddy that was with me yesterday got 2 and my buddy who was with me today got 7 with a 3 drift 3 fish streak!   Most fish were caught on roe bags using 4 lb test and small hooks. Here's a couple that I got.

173305,huntervasili,2008-03-19 01:04:00,1604,Nice fish! good on ya with the silver bullets
173325,ccmtcanada,2008-03-19 01:34:00,7971,Sweet!  Great job out there...it's always a rush to fight a steelie in closed quarters!
173334,fishnpro,2008-03-19 01:43:00,93,Those are some beauties. I was just wondering if you where fishing any of the eastern tribs because I was thinking of heading down tomorrow but I don't want to make the hour drive if the creeks are high and muddy. Any info would be appreciated.  -Fishnpro
173341,douG,2008-03-19 01:53:00,2693,"Yesterday and this morning, conditions were fine.  Wednesday, not so much. It's hard to believe that I can see brown grass where there was 3 ft of snow last weekend.  This rain and melt will help bring the staging fish upstream, but won't do much for the fishing opportunities.  Whatever you do, don't plan on fishing this weekend.  Nope, nope, nope."

173782,Josh Rogers,2008-03-19 21:41:00,79,Thanks Fellas. I love steelies and would fish them exclusively. I think fishing will be hot as soon as cons permit so make sure you get out there and catch a few of these beauties yourself. Tight lines!
