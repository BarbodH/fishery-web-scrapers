173076,Cast Adventures,2008-03-18 16:00:00,74,"________________________________________   Rivers super clear and fishing has been REALLY GOOD! Biggest trick from the boat lately has been to drive WAY outside of the drift so that you don't spook the school, and always leave your motor off when over the drift/fish.      Example: you catch a fish in a drift, when/if you decide to repeat the same drift again. drive straight out towards the center of the river until you drop off the ledge, then head back up to the top of the drift. I've seen in the past few weeks with the clear water other boats drive back to the top right over the fish, resulting in fewer bites for all of us.......but i never get mad, just move and look for new water.     By avoiding the school of fish all together with the big motor running, we've had several days when you didn't have to leave a drift! Boat traffic can effect the fishing as well. Good to get in on the hot action, but hunting for fresh fish/areas has help big time!  Fish have been hitting roe, live minnows, k-wick fish, jigs, yarn flies. We've really started mixing up presentations with the clear water past two days. Good way to get extra bites over the course of the day........   Shore line is starting to break up. Seen guys having a hard time walking close to the river bank. Falling through holes, ice chunks breaking off.......be carefully if you go to the glen!  See you on the River,  Cast Adventures"

173182,Cast Adventures,2008-03-18 20:55:00,74," Highdrifter,  Just wanted to follow up regarding your reply to my fishing report. 1st off My name is Paul Castellano, nice to meet you and thank you for reading the post.

173203,highdrifter,2008-03-18 21:41:00,2534," Gawd, maybe I will!  Yeeeessshh, leave it up to you to bring me back to reality..    For you though, I will require payment in full, and the interest is compounding daily...  I think I'll just keep taking people out for free though..  OFC is here to make friends, not clients.  tight loops HD"
