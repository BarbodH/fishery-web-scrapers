173243,taper,2008-03-18 23:15:00,611,Yamaha outboards ( i expect it is a 4 stroke ) have been bullet proof for me. I like the look of the G3 but thought it was a bit expensive when I looked at them.

FYI....Gander mountain in Buffalo has the 17 1/2 ft sport with a 115 yammy 4stroke and all the bells and whistles for only $14,999.....thats a price drop of $5,000 !!! Sweet deal for sure. They had 3 last week. and one 20ft er i think. Easier to bring across than you think."
