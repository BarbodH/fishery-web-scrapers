173193,tinbanger,2008-03-18 21:13:00,1028,I have no clue when it comes to fishing rivers so thought I 'd throw out these questions .  Any river fishing opportunities beween Barrie and Parry sound this time of year or is all still froze solid? Will rain tonight tomorrow make it not worthwhile I'm travelling north tomorrow on buisness.  Pikeie has got the itch to try our some of the flies he's created over the winter .  Thanks for any and all responses   TB
