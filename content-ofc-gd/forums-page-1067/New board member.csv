173128,smbhunter,2008-03-18 18:58:00,186,"Hello to all!  I just signed up to the board the other day, after constant nagging from Roger, (aka BPSBASSMAN) and having the privilege to meet lew on the weekend. So far I am quite impressed with the atmosphere on this board compared to some others. It's like an extended family here, which is great. I look forward to future discussions and all else that this board has to offer.  P.S.  Just kidding about the nagging Roger. LOL!!!  CIAO Jason"

Comic book stores abound.. but good luck finding anyone that can read them to you  Just joking fellas.... but yes my SIL is moving to the rock.. for bigger and better.... hope someone there can make her a cappa-frappachino half-caf  grande...like her local StarBucks can.... god help the local breakfast shop...
