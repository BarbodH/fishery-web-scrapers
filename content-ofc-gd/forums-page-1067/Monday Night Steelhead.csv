173200,Bernie,2008-03-18 21:36:00,3190, I'd say he hooked it right about here.

173280,Bernie,2008-03-19 00:40:00,3190," Long over ""perhaps"" Bly   Ha!  ""Perhaps"" it's like what it says in your signature."
173289,highdrifter,2008-03-19 00:51:00,2534,NICE!  Do you do a lot of your fishing at night?  You seem to be turning nocturnal!  cheers HD
173290,Josh Rogers,2008-03-19 00:55:00,79,Nice fish and report guys. When it's this time of year and there is action to be had you need to have at it when you can! Plus you probably didn't have anyone walking in on your spots either!
173295,Joey,2008-03-19 00:57:00,9122,"Once again, some more nice fish.  Wish I was as close to the tribs and lake that you two are.  In fact, I'm jealous  Beauty fish, way to go you two.  Joey"

173327,danbouck,2008-03-19 01:37:00,4380,"That's it, I can't take it anymore! Next time you go out fishing I'm going with you! It's been weeks now since I last caught something. (and it was an 11"" pike)"
173342,tibbs,2008-03-19 01:54:00,650,Great Report! Those are some nice steelhead!
173356,Darek,2008-03-19 02:09:00,20,nice job. ccmt you are the king of the eastern steelheads!
173361,Moosebunk,2008-03-19 02:12:00,3970,Fish much do ya??  Another good round of bows Cliff.
173362,Moosebunk,2008-03-19 02:12:00,3970,And Bly
173373,scuro,2008-03-19 02:30:00,386,You guys do it in style.
173376,ehg,2008-03-19 02:32:00,2666,Great report and nice fish.
173401,discophish,2008-03-19 03:14:00,392,"Are you sure you aren't using crack instead of roe?  You are getting the fish ""hooked""!!!  Great job again!  Congrats to both of you!"
172882,ccmtcanada,2008-03-18 02:49:00,7971,"With the rain coming on Tuesday and Wednesday, along with temps above freezing, the tribs will be nice and blown and likely not fishable until the weekend, so we decided to head out tonight to try our luck.  The waters were slightly above normal and tea stained, with about 6"" of visibility.  We put our little one to bed and off we went...we drove a little further than we normally would, hoping to have some success.  About 20 minutes after we arrived, bly was having some line issues, so she stopped fishing for a few minutes....and of course, my float goes down while she's taking her break.  I set the hook and the fish goes crazy...for about 20 seconds, then it came in nice an easy.    About 10 minutes later, bly says ""Fish ON!!"", and she gets a nice little guy...eater size, but was released to swim another day.   Thinking this hole was done for a while, we headed off and tried a few other locations, without any luck.  Bly had to re-tie a bunch of times after snags, and I was having no luck at all.  We decided to head back to our original location to see if there were more fish there.  Bly had to re-tie again, and was contemplating even rigging back up again.  She decided to do so and began drifting again.  My float went down...missed hit!  Then the tables turned...I had a break off and since we were going to leave in a few mintues, I decided not to re-tie.  Well wouldn't you know it...bly has a hit...sets the hook and the fish gets off.  She brought her line in...gave the pool a break for a few minutes while she put a fresh roe bag on.  Sure enough, it goes down again and the fight is on.  This fish was bigger than her last and went crazy!  It even swam right at her like it was shot out of a gun, but she managed to keep the fish on.  Here it is....   So, all in all, we had a great night out there.  She went 2 for 3 and me 1 for 1.  The only saving grace for me, even though I was outfished was that I had the biggest fish...LOL.  That's probably it now until at least the weekend...if the tribs are even fishable."
172884,irishfield,2008-03-18 02:51:00,26272,Another great outing for the duo !  Everytime I read this I wait for someone to call Children's Aid on you.. 
172886,Bernie,2008-03-18 02:53:00,3190,"Well done you two.  Just out of curiosity, what do you do for lighting when you fish at night? Is there enough ambient light ?"
172887,ccmtcanada,2008-03-18 02:53:00,7971, LOL...dont forget we have a 16 year old daughter who babysits (if you can call it that when the little one is in bed already)....perhaps I should start mentioning that in my reports as well....
172888,irishfield,2008-03-18 02:55:00,26272,"Yah I know that.. and you know that... just probably makes a few go ""the nerve.. leaving a little girl alone in the house to go off fishing"""
172891,huntervasili,2008-03-18 02:56:00,1604,WTG to both of you Cliff and Carole... great way to spend a couple hours on a monday night
172896,ccmtcanada,2008-03-18 02:59:00,7971, Light? Who needs light? Our roe is special blend...stinky enough that any fish can find it.
172898,Greencoachdog,2008-03-18 03:03:00,8163,"Great report and Pics y'all!!! Cliff, you got the first fish and the biggest fish. Carole got the most fish, the last fish, and the smallest fish.  That's the way we count them here in B'ama."
172919,moose72,2008-03-18 03:50:00,28,"Nice fish! Where did you hook those? I'm going to try Bronte tomorrow, any suggestions on tackle or tecnique?"
172922,fishing n autograph,2008-03-18 03:56:00,2540,nice fish...good goin!
172927,chickenhawk,2008-03-18 05:07:00,612,thats a beauty hen you got there cliff! congrats on a good night....
172932,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-18 07:27:00,1183,"Way to go you two.    Funny, I was thinking the same as Irishfield...but I knew about your older daughter.  Now the newbies do too.     Keep those reports coming."
172937,solopaddler,2008-03-18 08:46:00,8605,"Another great outing guys, congrat's!"
172940,fatherof3,2008-03-18 09:11:00,1769,"good way to spend a night,congrats"
172945,Shelley Cooper,2008-03-18 10:03:00,394,Now thats a nice evening out....  Congrats...
172962,tjsa,2008-03-18 11:47:00,1578," My guess would be..........in the mouth..........  Great report Cliff and well done by you and Bly. I have never fished for steelhead in the dark, in over 30 yrs. of fishing for them."
172974,b2kptbo,2008-03-18 12:14:00,1505,Good stuff...
172976,SlowPoke,2008-03-18 12:17:00,2984,Another great report! -Brian
172994,ccmtcanada,2008-03-18 13:08:00,7971," Standard float setup should be fine.  I usually start using roe, but always have a variety of jigs and flies as well.  Good luck out there!  Be careful on any trib over the next few days...with the rain, and melt off from the warm temps, water conditions can change within minutes.  I've been fishing before and then suddenly notice that the water seems ""louder""...then take a look and see the levels rise quickly."
173000,moose72,2008-03-18 13:24:00,28,Thanks for the tip.
173006,Jeff R,2008-03-18 13:47:00,94,Well done...some nice looking fish there...That fish looks big enough to be an OFAH entry Cliff
173009,ccmtcanada,2008-03-18 13:51:00,7971, Yep...minimum is 21 inches.  Mine was 28 and Blys second fish was 25.
173012,Reef Runner,2008-03-18 13:55:00,981,"Looks like you guys had another great outting.  Thanks for sharing,  reefrunner"
173014,Jeff R,2008-03-18 13:58:00,94,Sweeeeeeet...  . and congrats
173056,fishnsled,2008-03-18 15:12:00,3520,Nice going you two!  Good to see that you are getting out again and doing well.
