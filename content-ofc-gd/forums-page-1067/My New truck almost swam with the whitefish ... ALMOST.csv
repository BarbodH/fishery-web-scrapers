172532,Stoty,2008-03-17 15:36:00,2910, Well said.
172534,Headhunter,2008-03-17 15:41:00,5703,"Uh... yah... and getting in your car and driving on the 401 hasn't had any ill affect on any in the past either! Or standing at Victoria Park Station on the TTC at mid-night has all the assurances that anyone needs , for their own safety! Life is full of risks, unless you live in a plastic bubble.  I don't think he was reckless, just a little unlucky. HH"
172536,Stoty,2008-03-17 15:44:00,2910,I think its more of the issue of it being so preventable.
172617,Kirk,2008-03-17 18:28:00,347,"VP station after dark, now that's a suicide wish...I'd prefer a van on Simcoe in April, at least there might be someone to help me."
172631,Headhunter,2008-03-17 19:05:00,5703,"Oh, don't worry Kirk... they'll help themselves to anything you have! All the help you could possibly ask for and more! LOL Stoty, yes if was preventable, but no more preventable then the guys who take their ""just a little too small"" boat on Lake O, but are gonna stay close to shore. Virtually all ""bad things"" that can happen are preventable, if we don't do anything! HH"
172639,capt bruce,2008-03-17 19:26:00,820,"I have been driveing trucks out onto the ice for 30+ years Went thu only twice in that time . Once on simcoe like you and only the back of the truck went down , once on sucgog where the whole truck sunk but we were close to shore and only in 3 feet of water . Both times the truck was rescued and after minor repairs no worse for wear . I have allways made sure condishions were right and just put this down to as headhunter said BAD LUCK . S**8 happens you can slip in the shower a women I work with fell into the stairs on the street car going home one night and broke her neck and did some brain damage , she is parilized on one side and will never work again ???? I agree driving on ice too thin etc. is not smart but when condishions are good and trucks are plowing out ice roads you will find me out there ."
172640,Stoty,2008-03-17 19:27:00,2910,"I agree with the small boats on Lake Ontario.  I just find it hard to believe when people take risks like these just to catch some fish.  To me, its not worth the risk (physically or financially)."
172642,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-17 19:40:00,4399,I really don`t know what driving a vehicle on unsafe ice has to do with driving on the 401 but I would agree life is full of risks and I just prefer not to add any more risks.
172651,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-03-17 19:50:00,1362,"I'm drivin out on the river in a few minutes to try for some eyes....we plowed ice roads all day Saturday in order to help others get their shacks off for the MNR ice hut removal deadline of midnight Mar 15th....there's a good 24"" of ice on the river....not the 36"" that we usually have this time of year but it'll do....  Here's some pics from Saturday.....      "
172682,Kirk,2008-03-17 20:38:00,347,"On a happier note, no matter how careful we are, we all end up dead... so maybe the guys crashing thru the ice are doing things the right way, and they aren't around to speak up for themselves.  As a famous skydiver once said, ""I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not living"""
172689,banger,2008-03-17 21:03:00,95,"Ok, 1st of all.I'm glad your ok & nothing really happen so badly.   2sd you might have sucked up all the water on the top of the mats.But I will bet there is still h2o under the mats.I've been 4x4ing Jeeps for many years now.And after jumping in swamps & mud holes you soon figure out.That carpet has no place to be found in a Jeep.lol ( I ripped mine outta my Cherokee ) I would lift up you carpets in your truck ( by the doors are the easy ones to get at) you'll be shocked to see how much water is under that carpet.It will stink sooner or later.   3rd change your diff fluids frt & rear.You most likely have h20 in your diif's.And I would check/change your t-case oil as well.Your diff vent lines are not long enuff to stay outta h20.   oh yeah  crap happens.   take care.  Shawn."
172702,Tybo,2008-03-17 21:31:00,1373,"HERE, HOLD MY BEER AND WATCH THIS !!!"
172748,Bernie,2008-03-17 23:38:00,3190,"Ice conditions can change and knowing the lake you are on and keeping track of things like rapid temperature changes you can avoid potential problems. According to some oldtimers very cold temperatures can make the ice brittle so a warmer trend is safer to haul a heavy load. Pressure cracks can form in an instant so it may be good going out but not so good coming back. Keep speeds down, pressure waves can crack ice ahead of you, especially approaching shorelines. The boathouse (18x24) I moved last winter was done on 16"" of blue ice. Not sure what the boathouse weighed (let alone the truck) but it made the 1 kilometer drive across the bay. Taking things across to the islands in the winter is often the only feasible way to get large stuff there. I would not recommend anyone drive a vehicle out on ice they do not know conditions of. Talk to local people first and not just one of them. Some think they know but dont.   "
172755,ehg,2008-03-17 23:51:00,2666,"Stoty, by posting this comment here i have to go a bit off the thread topic. It seems you have no clue sometimes but a have strong opinion despite lack of experience. Personally i'll take a boat out on L. Ontario but only with extreme caution, foresight and thru experience. Usually i'll have my best fishing ever as a result. This is a fishing board so i'll post results occasionally. Some winters i won't be able to go there as the weather and conditions aren't ever right. Sometimes all the precautions will allow it to get done. Been doing that since you were probably in grade school.  I could do nothing and take no risks just sit in front of my computer and whine, but i digress.  Taking a vehicle out to whitey grounds has been going on forever with few issues. Cityfisher will probably be more apprehensive in the future."
172783,rhare,2008-03-18 00:45:00,387,Dont worry Wayne Im swimming at that end of the gene pool too  Its just as dangerous driving sleds or bikes out on the ice. How many people have hit pressure cracks on sleds and been hurt in the last week alone?  Lots of other people have been in the same situation this year. I pulled a guy out of a crack a few weeks ago. Its the risk yo take driving out there. I had no real problems and I drove all over the lake. Like has been said before wrong place wrong time.  I miss it already 
172795,danbouck,2008-03-18 01:08:00,4380,I can't believe some of these responses. As I said earlier I wouldn't take my truck out on the ice BUT that is because it is rarely done down here and I havn't done it (don't know enough about it). Places up north depend on those ice roads. I would probably feel safer on one of the ice roads in Temagami than my daily drive on the 401. Glad your safe and s%it happens!
172844,Stoty,2008-03-18 02:07:00,2910," Truck = heavy Ice = unpredictable  With those two things put together, yes you're right I lack experience in taking my truck on the ice because I have NEVER done it, nor will I ever. It goes to show you that it doesn't matter if the ice is 8"" thick or 22"" thick. Its a risk no matter what. And to catch some whitefish, isn't worth the damage to myself or my truck.  This is a forum, which is pretty much based on people's opinions. In my opinion, its not worth the risk of taking a vehicle onto the lake. You opinion might vary from mine, but that doesn't mean its wrong."
172855,Bernie,2008-03-18 02:24:00,3190,"Actually ice is predictable Stoty, at least at my area of the lake. Each year the ice begins to form in shallower areas and slower current flows. The pressure crack pops up very close to the same line across the lake. There are the usual spots that the ice does not get as thick as other areas. This is where experience and information comes in. If someone goes through (at least in my neck of the woods) its always in the same spots. I do not recommend people to drive where ever they want because of that. Following a well traveled ice road is beneficial due to no, or well packed snow keeping the snow insulation to a minimum allowing good ice formation."
172996,cityfisher,2008-03-18 13:09:00,959, Yeah Ive been running a demudifier for the past day and also been drying the under padding.. Most of it is pretty dry now...BUt still needs a couple days of work. After i get the bumpers fixed up im going to drain the fluids just to be sure.
173237,banger,2008-03-18 23:09:00,95,"Sounds like a good idea about the demudifier it can't hurt.But most underpadding is really! think ( more for sound proffing than anything) and the humidfier might not go throught the think padding.I'd hate to see you have h2o under that mat, and watch your truck rust out FAST.  ANd about waiting to change/check your fluids. If it was summer, I'd say ""maybe""? wait a bit...but having h20 in your diff's or t-case in the winter will do some major damage.  I would'nt wait to long IMO. it sure can't hurt.   take care, us jeep guys have to stick together.  Shawn.    PS, my  old Cherokee with no  carpet/mats.   just for fun. "
173253,Sinker,2008-03-18 23:48:00,8692,"Ya, you want to check for water in the diffs. If that freezes, and its full of water/oil, you can crack the housings open......then your in to big bucks. Much cheaper to get a few jugs of oil and change it out now...........its gonna get cold again in the next few days!!  Sinker"
173417,douG,2008-03-19 03:44:00,2693,"I heard a radio interview with a dude that drives a 100,000 lb semi for 16 hours each way on McRae Lake in the NWT."

172501,Joey,2008-03-17 14:27:00,9122,"I'm glad you posted it Cityfisher.  It just goes to show you that one person driving out there can be just fine, while another can hit a bad spot very easily and not be fine.  I agree with HH and wonder myself if some of the people who leave bad comments have nothing better to do.  I think that there should be a new rule.  Before you post, there is a 5 minute delay so the person can think about whether he or she has ever done anything remotely close to the topic, how they would feel in the same situation and whether or not they would say the same thing to the person's face!!!  Joey"
172503,johnnyb,2008-03-17 14:37:00,3413,"It also seems that the negative posters disappear quicly, while the supportive ones stick around.  Just another reason, IMHO, that this board sticks around...there's a solid bunch of supportive sportsmen/women.  Really glad to see you got that beautiful Jeep, along with yourself and those with you, out of the hole safe and sound, Cityfisher."
172519,Hookset,2008-03-17 15:04:00,367, Great point Joey.  Glad it all worked out OK for you Cityfisher. Some days...Poo happens.   Hookset.
172522,Kirk,2008-03-17 15:11:00,347,"Eugene's not complaining LOL and anything you can walk away from is good news, heckuva alot better than sitting on the bottom of Simcoe.  Reasonable price is anything less than salvage recovery (which I think comes with a 'pollution' fine)"
172526,TJQ,2008-03-17 15:22:00,7806,Scary stuff.. worked out though....  like it has been said.. it could have been much worse.
172530,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-17 15:30:00,4399," Well Joey and others I don`t think anybody here was too hard on Cityfisher and his poor judgment/misfortune, every year we hear stories of people,snowmobiles,trucks that go through the ice and there is usually a handful of people who pay with their lives and they leave behind loved ones who have to deal with the tragedy. It usually happens early in the season and late in the season I think most would agree that this time of year taking a vehicle out on the ice is a gamble. Warmer days ice shifting and cracking partial freezing and thawing again is a recipe for a potential disaster. I can assure you I always think about what I am posting and I can also assure you I have never taken a vehicle out on the ice and I never will it`s a risk reward thing.  When a member posts a topic and expects replies they should do it with the understanding that all the responses might not be of the golly gee you poor baby type some may actually respond with what they think and that`s what makes a bulletin board."

171910,bbog,2008-03-15 23:11:00,665,Glad to hear you got out. How thick was the ice?
171913,Greencoachdog,2008-03-15 23:18:00,8163,Y'all be keerfull out there now... ya heah?
171918,cityfisher,2008-03-15 23:27:00,959,20-22 inches of ice.. Tones of ice ... Just not where I was driving..  Looked to be a crack that opened up just intime to let me take a dip
171922,Cory,2008-03-15 23:32:00,170,I've looked at the pictures a few times and still can't find the truck......
171928,Gerritt,2008-03-15 23:36:00,6129,"glad your safe n sound.... but if you think the tow was expensive.... you would not want to see the bill if it went down... it would be alot more then your ""truck"" is worth... likely triple if not more...  G"
171936,ccmtcanada,2008-03-15 23:48:00,7971,"Wow...at least your truck has been saved!  Our ABS light comes on when we get heavy rains or prolonged fog.  Once it dries out, it should all function again normally.  Are you sure the stereo amp is fried...maybe you got lucky and you blew a fuse.  The fuse may not be in the fuse panel...check the wiring on the amp, lots of times there will be an inline fuse."
171940,mepps,2008-03-15 23:57:00,1301,Scary stuff!!  No way I would have taken a brand new jeep out there even if it was 22 inches thick!  Gald you made it out ok though!

171951,Jeff R,2008-03-16 00:21:00,94,good to hear it wasn't more serious and all are safe
171958,Joey,2008-03-16 00:36:00,9122,We were out with RR and Chuck & Shelley today and heard of your plight.  I'm glad everything turned out okay for you.  We hit a few slushy spots while on our sled today and it was not evident until we were on top of them.  You lucked out this time bud.  Joey
171981,iceguy,2008-03-16 01:22:00,341,Totally bad luck dude! Trucks have been going over the tracks for days....Wrong place wrong time. Im glad to hear you got it out.
171989,danbouck,2008-03-16 01:56:00,4380,"Glad to hear you are fine. Could have been a lot worse! I don't think I would ever trust my vehicle on ice, but then again I am not used to seeing them out there!"
172025,bucktail,2008-03-16 05:12:00,1857,Wow I think I would have soiled my pants. How far offshore were you?
172028,tjsa,2008-03-16 06:18:00,1578,"Sheesh, not a good thing to happen to anyone, must have been a dramatic experience for you the moment it happened. Glad it all worked out. I do not drive out on ice very much any more, maybe once every 3 yrs., snowmobiles are much easier to get out of those situations or completely avoid them happening, but I know the ice conditions on certain lakes ahead of time from previous visits to offset the chance of that situation happening to me. Last time on the ice for me in my truck was 2 yrs. ago, when it was almost 3 ft. thick, in mid-march, with no snow load left on the ice."
172039,Big Cliff,2008-03-16 09:30:00,6899,"Well, I'm really glad to hear you got it out, too bad someone took advantage of your situation to charge you a lot of money. Some people are just like that. Most important thing is that no one was hurt and there wasn't more damage.  I do occasionally take my SUV out on the ice but I have to admit I'm always nervous, you just never know when a crack will open up or you will find someones ice hut hole that has been covered over by snow."
172073,Photoz,2008-03-16 11:44:00,792,"WHEW W W  W   W . . . .   .   !!

Seems to be more 'hidden' cracks which change on a daily basis this year . . . .

172074,Stoty,2008-03-16 11:57:00,2910,"Glad everyone is OK, but I agree, I would never bring my truck out on the ice no matter how thick the ice was. In my opinion, if you take a truck on the ice, and it falls through, its no-ones fault but your own. Its hard to sympathize over that."
172076,Bly,2008-03-16 12:06:00,1556,Must have been tense!   Glad to hear that you are ok and were able to find some help.   Hope everything dries out alright....look forward to the update.
172078,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-16 12:14:00,2585,glad to hear your safe.  Im not sure i would ever bring a truck out onto the ice.  even if the ice was 22 inches thick.  I hear about things like this happeneing all the time.  Cheers!
172096,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-16 13:13:00,4399,"First like everyone else I am glad you survived but man I must say you are now added to the stupid human trick wall of shame, don`t worry there`s plenty of ice fishermen there with you.  Seems to me this happens early and late every icefishing season you`d think the icefishing guys could figure out this pattern.  Expensive new vehicle + no insurance coverage on ice + unpredictable late season ice + possibility of heavy cost of retrival + heavy fines, seems to be an easy choice.  Betcha you won`t do that again."
172127,cityfisher,2008-03-16 14:22:00,959,O well it happens  I learned my lesson... Ive been out multiple times with a truck this year and know of MULTIPLE others who went out also.  Atleast its a day id always remember !!
172140,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-16 15:02:00,4399,"Yes there seems to be a lot of individuals who are willing to roll the dice when it comes to their physical and financial well being seems kind of silly to me to risk all that for a fish dinner.  Physical well being aside can you imagine the cost of recovering a vehicle from the bottom of the lake, hiring a helicopter with the capability to lift the load, hiring professional divers to hook it up and then having to deal with the ministry of enviroment and a angry spouse. I would imagine it would be quite a bill.  I am surprised that the goverment has not banned the use of personal vehicles on the ice."
172148,Deano,2008-03-16 15:31:00,767,"""I am surprised that the government has not banned the use of personal vehicles on the ice.""  Statements like that are why we are losing all our rights.  Can't believe the negative feedback here from fisherman. We're always out on the lakes around here in winter be it fishing or just for fun, many snowmobile trails are across the lakes. He hit a bad spot and sure it could of been worse, but no different than hitting an icy spot on the highway and losing it. Commonsense and a little bit of caution goes a long way. As for the stupid ones who go out when the ice isn't thick or unsafe, well those people will be doing something stupid on the roads if they weren't on the lake.You can't govern stupidness.  Good to here you were OK, Cityfisher, I for one have been driving on the lakes for 20 years, and haven't had any problems, but do know the limitations of when to and not to. Don't let one bad experience ruin it for you forever."
