172881,fishing n autograph,2008-03-18 02:45:00,2540, that's the photo on my ID....i have a stunning resemblance to chief clancy wiggum!
172883,ccmtcanada,2008-03-18 02:50:00,7971,Oh man Shawn....that sucks!!!!  I hope your car turns up with all your stuff in it still...and they throw the book at the person who stole it!!!!!!
172889,keram,2008-03-18 02:55:00,585,"Sorry to hear that Shawn, I hope that you will get your car back soon in the same condition you left it I will keep my fingers  X     I'm still thinking if I should laugh or cry after this  .........................., still  ................... oh crap it is hard I think I'm going to flip the coin"
172892,irishfield,2008-03-18 02:56:00,26272,"I just remember where a lot of teachers cars ""went"" when I was in High School Keram"
172911,Sinker,2008-03-18 03:22:00,8692,"Yup, that sucks man!!   Nothing worse than a thief!  I had a grand am stolen right from my driveway too......in Newcastle!! My dog was barking in the middle of the night.......and here I am yelling at him to shut up..  ....lol.......meanwhile, some dirtbag  is stealing my car  !!!! ........oh and get this......sold that house.....within the first week, the new owner had his brand new 3/4 ton chev stolen out of the same driveway......unreal!! The car was found out in Burkton....stuck in a mud hole, burnt to the ground.......the truck was never to be seen again!!  It ended up being a blessing for me with my car. I got a good deal.......the guy with the truck lost $.  Hope it works out for ya man, good luck!!  Sinker"
172936,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-18 08:17:00,1183,Sure would be nice to have it sitting back there this morning...  Had a gutless cutlass stolen many years ago.  The guy used a stolen credit card to fill it up...gas attendant was on the ball...didn't take long for the Police to catch up to him.  Anyhow...I know the feeling well...hope it works out for you.
172953,Big Cliff,2008-03-18 10:39:00,6899,"Sorry to hear about your car, even if you do get it back it is really inconvenient to say the least.  Sure sounds like who ever did it had a lot of inside information though. How would they know where you kept your keys? Even if they lucked out and just found the keys, how could they have known which car they fit or where to find it parked? How could they have known about the two minute window with the camera so they could get the car without being spotted.  Are these things that most students could have known?  BTW, what is your plate # I'll keep an eye out around here."
172964,ecmilley,2008-03-18 11:55:00,2163,all that means is I am off the hook don't have to fix that junk anymore
173003,Jeff R,2008-03-18 13:36:00,94,"Truly a kick in the butt...Sorry to hear that Shawn...May have to keep an eye on e-bay, or the triad for someone offering really good deals on fishing gear...maybe the best link to finding the little pr...Hope it all works out for you"
173004,ccmtcanada,2008-03-18 13:38:00,7971, Spoken like a true friend....LOL
173008,bassboy,2008-03-18 13:49:00,161,"Ill Keep my eyes open for it Shawn.....I am layed off so Ill be out and about around the 'shwa and surrounding area the next little while.  Really sucks that someone would do that......and seems a little coincidental that it wouldnt get caught on tape?  Sounds like someone has been casing things out for a while to me.  Hopefully you will get it back though, and all in tact.  Bill"
173016,Reef Runner,2008-03-18 14:08:00,981,"That totally sux dude.  Hopefully a depper investigation finds out more for ya.  I'll keep ny eyes out for it in my travels though.  Had a brand spanken new Honda Accord V6, with the special no start without this fancyarse microchiped key, lifted right out of my driveway in the middle of the night last year.  They must've brought a flat bed and disengaged the alarm in the driveway.  Mindboggling.  reefrunner"
173018,danbo,2008-03-18 14:12:00,2646,Keep your keys on a carabiner on your belt from now on..
172760,fishindevil,2008-03-18 00:12:00,6254,"Well all was going good today till 3:30pm when my day shift was over,and looked for my car keys,that wernt in their usual spot,and guess what they were not there !!! so im thinking that my co-workers are playing a joke,and a few of them try to help me find them,so i decided to walk outside to the parking lot,and low & behold,my car isnt right outside our boiler room door in the custodial parking space,so now im saying ok guys wheres my car !!!! well everyone  is promising me that they didnt move it or anything,so we search around the building and yup its gone !!!!!....so up to the front office and we start to check the outdoor survalence camera,and we have it narrowed down to 12:46pm,and 12:48pm in the 2 mins it took for the camera to sweep the parking lot,it was gone !!!!!!as it takes up to 2 mins to pan back & forth !!  so after calling the police & insurance company,we tried to figure it all out and it seems that a student or who knows else went in to our lunchroom,and took my keys and stole my car....with so many people at a big high school its hard to keep an eye on everybody,even the cameras in the halls didnt pick up anything out of the norm,so we just dont know,our  lunchhroom door is usually locked if we are out and about,but if we are in & out for a few mins it sometimes isnt, we just dont know right now,so now its just hurry up & wait for the police to hopefully recover my car,i hope all my stuff is still in there,my GPS,my boat keys,cd""s,rod & reel in the trunk,my new trailer-jack,my fishing glasses,my back medicine,along with other items,i even had fishing lures hanging in the car !!!

172766,bbog,2008-03-18 00:21:00,665,"Look on the bright side - if it does come back it won't need the window replaced or the body repaired from being ""broken"" into. Hope it works out for you."
172767,danbouck,2008-03-18 00:23:00,4380,That sucks! Hopefully they are not doing some joy riding in it right now.
172768,Mike the Pike,2008-03-18 00:24:00,3421,Is the contents of the car worth more than the car.  Ouch Shawn sounds like you have alot to lose if the punks take the contents.  Now about that van you wanted.  I hope you get it all back bud.
172769,fatherof3,2008-03-18 00:25:00,1769,"that really sucks,hope it somehow works out for ya"
172771,Daplumma,2008-03-18 00:31:00,1961,That will make you crazy..hope it works out for ya! Joe

172785,Mark Kulik,2008-03-18 00:46:00,348,Sorry to hear that Shawn-hope you get your car and stuff back!
172790,tjsa,2008-03-18 00:58:00,1578,"Yes, that bites for sure. Hope you get lucky and get everything back intact. I do not leave my house/car/truck/shed/toys keys in my office, they are on of those small mini-carabiners you can buy from almost anywhere, clipped onto one of my belt loops of my jeans, all day, along with my work keys. I jingle and jangle walking around my workplace, our local university, but I know where they are at all times. Sometimes, if I do not have them clipped to my belt loop for whatever reason, I feel like something familiar is missing. Maybe thats why I walk with a lean to the right all the time,"
172796,charlied,2008-03-18 01:10:00,584,i feel your pain...same thing happened to me 6 years ago...also a grand am.  Car was found with the axle broken and the motor shot.  Hope this doesn't dampen your spirits...LOL.
172799,Smokey,2008-03-18 01:14:00,1278,Sorry to hear about your car theft Shawn. I'll keep my eyes open in my travels for you.
172802,fishing n autograph,2008-03-18 01:18:00,2540,Sorry to hear about your car....  It's 99% a student who's looking for a joy ride....the grand-am isn't a car that is high demand or bound for Russia....if it were a Benz or Bentley i'd think twice lol
172809,Greencoachdog,2008-03-18 01:23:00,8163,That's terrible Shawn!!! I hope they catch the little snot-nose and throw the book at him!
172829,PERCHER,2008-03-18 01:56:00,787,Sorry to hear Dude.I hope they get stuck with all the lures hanging in the car.Then you catch the person in the hall with all the band aids on.I hope it all works out for you Bud.Call me and let me know what happens. Dan
172837,huntervasili,2008-03-18 02:01:00,1604,Best of luck finding everything intact and where you left it in the car.
172841,Gerritt,2008-03-18 02:03:00,6129,"  not gonna happen here... he will plead guilty, get 40 hours community service and 2 years probation.... If that....  Shawn that just plain sucks man... I hope you get your car back in one piece.... but maybe you could also be wishing you dont get it back, and let the insurance company deal with it... Sad but true... but that is why you have insurance.  Good luck bud.  G"
172843,ketchenany,2008-03-18 02:06:00,3229,"Sorry to hear about your loss! Hope you get it back. I remember last year or so ICEGUYD (Don) lost his trailer and it was full of fishing equipment, but never heard if he got it back. He came over to my house once, an amazing guy.  My son in-law lost his SIR in the Canadian Tire parking lot at Weston and Hwy 7 at 1 pm a few years back,  which he managed and they never found a trace of it. The funny thing is they thought he was going for lunch and seen it being driven away.  But here is a good one, I worked for an ad agency that we did  ads for a high-end luxury car and we could 'borrow"" a car when we wanted. A good friend of mine took a car out and was having dinner with his wife at very, lets say ""nice area;""  after dinner he came out and the car ($125,000) was gone, all they found was the lock where he had parked it. According to the report this thing was loaded and gone before he finished dinner, apparently on one of those drive up trailer they use in movies.  It was my turn a few weeks later and I kept the one I got  locked in the  garage unless I was in it. I took it back in one piece."
172864,Radnine,2008-03-18 02:32:00,1538,"Was that during a lunch period? Cause if not, the attendance sheets could come in handy for that period. Or who was there for period 1,2 and 3 but not the rest of the day, that sort of thing. I'm sure the VP is all over it. Good luck."
172866,urbanangler1990,2008-03-18 02:33:00,933,i have to give u a hand for finding moments to laugh  hope u get it back!!!
172873,kickingfrog,2008-03-18 02:39:00,8333,Wouldn't you just want 5 minutes with the little son-of-a-gun.
172874,fishing n autograph,2008-03-18 02:40:00,2540,i'm sure you're car will be found in a parking lot of a local mall....usually that's where i find 'em...
172880,urbanangler1990,2008-03-18 02:44:00,933,  oh so ur really a cop? or is that just an avator?
