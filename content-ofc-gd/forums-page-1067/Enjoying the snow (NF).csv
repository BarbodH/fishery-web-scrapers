I especially liked the video portion when the dog was traveling back toward the camera, ears flopping above the snow load with its head barely visible, creating a wave of snow ahead of him/her. I would not want to dry him, or her, off, before coming back in the house though, that looks like a lot of work!!!!!!!"

173064,blaque,2008-03-18 15:26:00,2419,"those are freaking hilarious....i was worried about the snow dog havin trouble breathin at times, thats gotta be tough gettin air wiith all that snow up your nose.  But he kept divin back in. LOVE those videos, as someone said, something about a naive goofy dog that just makes ya smile even on the toughest days LOL They're even cuter than the kid in the sling shot video. Id watch this stuff all day long."

173116,Deano,2008-03-18 18:26:00,767,"I was thinking the same thing Cliff, I just couldn't narrow it down to exactly where I've seen it. Bugs Bunny. LOL  Great ball video also, too funny."
