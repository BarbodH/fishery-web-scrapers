172735,boatman,2008-03-17 23:00:00,350,I just picked up a mig welder and I'm looking to buy some mild steel to build a welding bench. Where can I buy some mild plate steel around Hamilton? Does Stelco or Dofasco have a retail outlet?

172853,Radnine,2008-03-18 02:22:00,1538,There is a Metal Supermarket in Stoney Creek (Grays road I think). Lincoln had some great deals at the sportsman show. Did you get your welder there by chance?

172944,boatman,2008-03-18 09:42:00,350, I picked up a Miller 210 mig welder for work from Praxair and a MasterCraft (Campbell Hausfeld) mig welder from CTC for home. The Miller is a beautiful machine. The Mastercraft is alright. It gets the job done.  I'll check those other places too. Thanks a lot everyone.
