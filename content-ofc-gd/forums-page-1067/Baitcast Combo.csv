172707,Roy,2008-03-17 21:39:00,13728,Be grateful. Think of it as valet service.  I've noticed that valet service is not available for 60 gallon water heaters and sheets of drywall.
172758,holdfast,2008-03-18 00:03:00,1813,"I agree and I just seen one on sale here at Canadian Tire for 79 bucks.  I use mine for Trolling, and heavy duty still fishing for big Muskies and Jack.  It casts good enough for me."
172759,mepps,2008-03-18 00:05:00,1301,One thing I'll mention about the Maina rods is that there is a hook holder hole in the trigger that seems to weaken the trigger. Many of the rods at BPS had the trigger broken right off.  My partner patched up the hole himself and the rod has been excellent!  Anyone else had trouble with this type of trigger with the hole in it?  
172764,bbog,2008-03-18 00:17:00,665,Might be a bit out of your way but the CTC in Port Perry had a load of them when I visited this afternoon. I don't know if one store would ship it to another for you?
172854,muskymike,2008-03-18 02:24:00,772,"BPS had a tone of 6501's C4's but not sure about the C3's. The C4's were only $90 after tax. Great deal for a spare or an occasional use reel.  If you are going to use it all the time try and convince yourself to spend a little more, you wont be disappointed and it will last a lifetime"
172894,Garry2Rs,2008-03-18 02:57:00,1425,"Don't buy the 01 unless you're left handed! There is a reason why right handers use right hand reels. If you are right handed, it is easier to learn on a right hand reel.  Trust me you will have less problems. PM me for more information. Abu C3's are okay, I have owned several.  IMHO, they are not strong and require a lot of TLC. An Abu would not be my first choice as a baitcasting reel. The Pete Maina rig is excellent value for the money, if you talking a first Musky rig. If you want a more all around bait casting set-up PM me and I will help you. Garry2rs"
173029,Reef Runner,2008-03-18 14:36:00,981,"Thanks for your input everyone.  Bought an Abu 6501 C3 at CTC, but it was $94.99 (half off $189.99); Did I get jipped for $20?  I checked with the store manager and said it was the right price.  Those who got it at $75 walked away with a bargain. Anyway, it's a real beaut...couldn't put it down and I'm happy with the purchase.  Oh, and I did end up getting the 6501(left retrieve) just because that's what I feel most comfortable with.  Paired it up with a BPS M/H 6'6"" two-piece, wanted the 7"" but it was a one-piece and I need to break it down for travelling.  Now I can't wait to christen it with it's first ski!!!  A big thank you to everyone weighing in and helping me make an educated purchase; the first fish caught/released on the rig will be dedicated to the community.  reefrunner"
173037,Roy,2008-03-18 14:53:00,13728,It's a decent price Reefrunner but I was under the impression that the MSRP on that reel was $139.99.
173045,John,2008-03-18 15:04:00,2956, I am right handed Garry and still can not understand casting with the right hand and then changing hands to retrieve. Especially when you are burning baits across the top of weeds.  01 series all the way for me..........
173053,Reef Runner,2008-03-18 15:12:00,981,"  I think I got a good price on it.  You know, I was under the same impression Roy and I checked the price with the store manager and all.  It even had a sticker price on it for reg. $189.99.  All in, I'm happy with it and I don't mind paying the extra fazools if it's a quality product.  Thanks again all,  reefrunner"
173065,walleyejigger,2008-03-18 15:27:00,876,"i'm also a lefty but have always reeled on the right with baitcasters without issue, find my left arm and wrist to be a little stronger so handles the fight/leverage/less fatigue better on a baitcaster than my right"

173242,John,2008-03-18 23:15:00,2956,Lefty shouldn't be any more money. I would show them the ad and perhaps get a few $'s back..
172663,capt bruce,2008-03-17 20:06:00,820,"I got two 6501's for the sale price of 74.99 . These were the last two reels they had (they didnt have any righties ) thats why I bought them I had gone in to get the hut and came out with the auger in stead and when I saw the sign in the reel case I grabbed the two reels allso lol NO hut tho they didnt have any left lol Was wierd tho I had to have the manager walk the reels up to the cash ??? dont know why this , they let me carry the 265 dollar auger but not the reels , never bought a reel from CTC before the guy said this was store policy or something wierd????"
172678,huntervasili,2008-03-17 20:28:00,1604," Yea it is funny... I they lock up anything in teh cases with padlocks and bags... funny how tehy have to lock a slingshot band and small multitools or knives but if you go down to the camping section or tools you can get a machete, or sledge hammer, axe with no problems... ohh well Store policy was their answer to me aswell..."
172695,gone_fishin,2008-03-17 21:21:00,481,the reason why they walk those items up to the cash is because they are valuable and small... small items are easy to put in a pocket without being noticed...
