172782,bramptonjerry,2008-03-18 00:45:00,132,"no real experience river fishing....thinking, 7 ft ultra light spinning rod, 8 lb fire line with 8lb floro leader, with a slip float and pink berkley worm...do I stand a chance?"
172801,mikec,2008-03-18 01:16:00,26,"depends on what your fishing for....assuming its steelhead i would reccomend a rod no shorter than say 8 and a half feet (preferably 10 feet or more) and a 6 pound leader maybe, the slip float and worms sound ok though.  on a 7 foot ultralight the steelhead will take you for quite the run and then snap your line, no control with this size....if its all you got why not though"
172821,bramptonjerry,2008-03-18 01:43:00,132,thanks for the tip...if I have fun at it I'll get one of those river spiining rods at bps the next time they go on sale
172832,muskymike,2008-03-18 01:58:00,772,What are you fishing for Jerry?
172840,mistaredone,2008-03-18 02:03:00,913,Stay up stream of Dundas in Erindale Park.  Im pretty sure anything down steam is off limits.  This may be just during spawning season but unless someone corrects me I wouldn't chance it.
172842,Radnine,2008-03-18 02:05:00,1538,"At the risk of sounding like a dope, why the Floro leader (in any circumstance, cause I seem to hear it a lot)?"
172857,mistaredone,2008-03-18 02:25:00,913,"Thin, Clear and tough for rocks and teeth."
172860,bramptonjerry,2008-03-18 02:28:00,132,floro is abrassion resistant and has close to the same qualities of refraction as does water making it near invisible

172984,nofrills,2008-03-18 12:42:00,89,Make sure you pack along your patience. I suspect quite a number people will be out in that particular area.
173026,bramptonjerry,2008-03-18 14:30:00,132,drove by last week-end and saw no one from the Dundas entrance anyway that's why I thought it would be a good place to practice up
