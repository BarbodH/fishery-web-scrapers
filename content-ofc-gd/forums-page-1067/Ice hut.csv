173058,walleyejigger,2008-03-18 15:16:00,876,"can be pretty hard depending on how long apart between visits and how cold it gets out there, start with sealing up the drafts around the bottom of the hut, don't pack snow  cause it can freeze ur hut in, we put cardboard all around, snow pack the bottom, and tape the top, leave the holes in the floor open when not there, and put something over the hole, we use big pieces of 3/4"" black rubber (as big as u can get in and cover it with some snow to insulate). then buy a spud and hope for luck, works well enough for us in the north but if ur not there for over a week and the temps go to -30 u may be SOL"
173081,tinbanger,2008-03-18 16:14:00,1028,I was thinkin the same 'cept maybe rigid insualtion in place of the rubber . will give it a try next year TB
