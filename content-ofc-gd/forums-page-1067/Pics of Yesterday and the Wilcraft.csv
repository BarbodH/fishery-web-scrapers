172390,Joey,2008-03-17 01:48:00,9122,"We tried for Lakers and Whities yesterday on Simcoe for the final time, and guess we were just in the wrong places as none of us got a thing.  Met up with Chuck and Shelley and then Ravinerat and his son joined us.      Ravinerat told us Sly had his new Wilcraft on the ice at a M & G so we toured over and gave it a looksee.  Enjoyed some tasty wings also.  Thanks to the LSMB for offering your good food and hospitality.  So here's the Wilcraft.  A cute little fishing mobile.  I notice the gas tank was pretty small.  You'd have to carry a gerry can around with you I think.              Joey"
172398,TJQ,2008-03-17 02:22:00,7806,NO fish.....  what the.... nhey thats a pretty cool machine!!
172400,irishfield,2008-03-17 02:25:00,26272,Nice pics Joey... now the question is... is it a boat with less than 10 HP = no registration/insurance required... or an ATV that needs plates/insurance?
172401,Greencoachdog,2008-03-17 02:34:00,8163,"Great report and pics Joey!!!  You can't tear them up every weekend, and y'all did wreak havoc on them last week (Grabbed it by the Tail!!!  )"
172402,Mike the Pike,2008-03-17 02:39:00,3421,So what about the lack of fish just getting out with good friends is what it is all about.  Great pics .Did ya use the new GPS yet?IS that how you found the fishing gadget
172405,Sinker,2008-03-17 02:45:00,8692," I believe its been classed as a boat less than 10 HP. Just need a slow moving vehicle placard to drive on the road. (so I hear)  Pretty slick little rig. We'll see how it holds up out there.  The fishing was tough out there for me as well, but I left with one whitie and one laker, so I'm not complaining  Sinker"
172410,Bernie,2008-03-17 02:53:00,3190,Too bad Italo didn't come by to offer a few fishing tips.
172440,Spiel,2008-03-17 09:55:00,9065, ....Ouch !  Hard to believe I didn't get out there this year Joey but I haved enjoyed it vicariously through your posts.
172441,Terry,2008-03-17 10:14:00,14456,nice to see you guys got out again  last I heard they are still trying to figure out how to license it in ontario
172443,ravinerat,2008-03-17 10:40:00,64,It was nice hooking up with you guys Joey. You sure couldn't beat just being on the lake that day. Still nursing my sun burn. The Wilcrat is classed as a boat in Ont. right now. I'm sure they'll change that once a few more are brought in. Remember the once only snowmobile license.  RR
172444,Shelley Cooper,2008-03-17 10:54:00,394,"Good to have met up with everyone out there... and a beautiful day to boot.... I'm nursing a sunburn too.. The food that FLSMB had out there was just amazing...  No fish for any of us, but a great time...I'm glad we finally found each other Joey.... I think Chuck and I did more touring on the new skidoo than we did fishing... lol"
172445,ccmtcanada,2008-03-17 11:11:00,7971,"Great report Joey!  You guys got out a lot this winter and you have the great results you enjoy.  Sounds like you had a fun day, and the weather looked like it cooperated for you!  That's a pretty cool vehicle...something like that may get out on the ice a little more often....LOL."
172448,Bly,2008-03-17 11:22:00,1556,"Day spent with friends, sunshine, cool toys, food and sunshine...a good day even without fish!   Thanks Joey"
172478,JohnF,2008-03-17 13:18:00,3494," If these pics appeared anywhere but a fishing forum I'd assume that it's a self-propelled porta-potty, a three holer yet.  JF"
172488,Beans,2008-03-17 13:38:00,3339, He could have Bernie...remember...It was Shelley (Lady Walleye) that taught him...
172567,shane,2008-03-17 16:56:00,652," HaHaHa!  That's a great idea!  $1.00 a shot................$5.00 if you want to be alone   Actually, it's a pretty cool looking rig."
172580,wallyboss,2008-03-17 17:13:00,1095,What is the wheel clearance on the Wilcraft.  Would it go on lakes with 2 feet of snow??????
172742,Fisherman,2008-03-17 23:19:00,7201,"Those wheel assemblies actually retract while fishing and power back down to get mobile, clearance I think is about 7 inches."
172744,Big Cliff,2008-03-17 23:24:00,6899,"Actually, I believe it is 11"" but I doubt it would go through more than that in snow, with a flat bottom I would suspect it would get hung up unless you had the drive tracks on the back then it would probably handle just about anything."
172923,Sinker,2008-03-18 04:05:00,8692,"The thing is, its pretty light. I beleive around 600lbs.  retract the wheels and slide it out and away you go.  The tracks are the way to go for lots of deep snow though, but I think even if you got it stuck, it would be easy to get unstuck.......easier than a 4 wheeler maybe.......what a nice rig for early and late season though.....when there is not much snow!!  Sinker"
