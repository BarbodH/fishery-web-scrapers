Pickings are slim up here when it comes to finding a trailer but we finally lucked in and got a sweet deal on a Karavan trailer used but only four years old.  My question is how should the bunks that the boat slides onto be placed.  Should they be placed to fit between the strakes or can the strakes rest on the bunks.  Currently the old rubber rollers which have turned into a rock like consistency lol  have always been positioned so that the strakes fit on top of them.  Any advice is appreciated as we would like to get the old boat on the newer trailer before freeze up.  It has a 90hp on it  Thanks in advance Blizz  "

Lots of great memories on it with our now 19 yr. old son.  Really dont want to damage the boat.  Looks like a 5 or 10 year old vessel except for the nostalgic colour scheme LOL.  Cheers Blizz"
