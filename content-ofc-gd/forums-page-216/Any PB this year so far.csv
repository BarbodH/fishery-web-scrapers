871371,jimmer,2014-09-08 19:49:00,2730,This is my personal best pike and I forgot to measure it. 
871399,Locnar,2014-09-08 21:27:00,645,"This is my PB Largie... 19.5"" long, 6"" from belly to back, just over 5lbs.  And my PB Chinook Salmon, caught on the U&Me charters with Lloyd. 25lber. "
871400,Locnar,2014-09-08 21:29:00,645,Does anyone know a taxidermist who does recreations? And possibly any kind of pricing?
871401,SuperDave,2014-09-08 21:38:00,204,No PB's size wise but 4 muskies in one day on a topwater is some kind of PB for me.
870798,LostAnotherOne,2014-09-05 01:16:00,956,"33"" Carp, 24"" Sucker, and 19"" Largemouth.  Hopefully I can add a laker or rainbow cause I have never landed one."

870801,chris.brock,2014-09-05 01:34:00,4053,"no, not for me  my wife caught her first muskie last weekend though, then she started singing this annoying song-  ""I caught a muskie, you lost a big muskie, you suck, you rot, I caught a muskie........""  it went on forever"
870809,LostAnotherOne,2014-09-05 02:05:00,956,"I've been out fished by my women too.  Two years ago my PB Smallie was a 19"" and she boated in a 20"".  I probably caught over 200 bass in my life and she about 5, but she caught the biggest one FOR NOW"

870827,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-05 03:20:00,8243,"Guys I have a motto I try and live by, "" Never date an ex wife and never fish with a future ex wife"".  Personal best this year 12 pound 3 oz Walleye, from Erie of course. Cheeks the size of a Fillet O Fish. Usually wouldn't keep a fish that size but its Erie and it's swim bladder was full coming up from 80 feet. If I would have released that fish the guys that have fished here for eons would have sent me over the side."
870829,tender52,2014-09-05 03:27:00,270,"Not me this year, but, my daughters got a 14 inch perch. A 17 inch sm bass respectfully. Finally put my nefews on their biggest fish. ( sm Bass  they are used to sunfish from shore )"

870839,fishindevil,2014-09-05 05:42:00,6254,No PBs yeT for me this year but I have got a nickel smallie and a few more that were right there !!!! But I still have a few months to chase the brown fish around yet and once all the citiots go home it will only get better as the fall weather is Comming and still have a few trips way up north to some famous smallie waters to fish yet so hopefully a pb is just a matter if time !!!! Fish-on !!!
870840,davey buoy,2014-09-05 06:59:00,5505,About 3 weeks ago a little over 6lb large mouth bass.What a nice little battle that was.!!!!

870852,Craigson,2014-09-05 11:09:00,117,"Just a 15"" Speck for me. Sadly I watched a spec over 20"" spit my Mepps out right at the net. Hoping to land my first Brown and Rainbow this fall/winter. And maybe a Chinny or two if im lucky. Good luck all"
870858,Gallie,2014-09-05 12:25:00,1215,Not a pb so much but i have gone 5 straight years without a single muskie. I have watched friends both experianced and new boat plenty of fish big and small. I have had follows and misses and fish get off but not in the boat. I went up to a friends camp in the kawarthas on my birthday and caught 12 little ones in one day. Yes. 12 muskie biggest was about 6lbs but it was soooooo nice. I dont think ill beat that number ever
870860,lew,2014-09-05 12:34:00,12766,Yes. 12 muskie biggest was about 6lbs but it was soooooo nice.   And THAT'S the exact reason I no longer fish muskies in the Kawarthas
