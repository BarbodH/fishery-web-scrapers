What really amazes me is for whatever reason people get as upset or ever more when an animal or fish as in this case is killed for no other reason than it exists. Genocide exists in our world on a daily basis in more than one African nation by the 100's of thousands, ISIS has declared war on all non believers and other Muslims that don't believe what they believe. And hardly an eye is batted in the western world until 2 Americans are beheaded for all to see. I know this is a fishing forum not a political forum but we do have a thread about a Hockey team that is hundreds of pages long.  Another point I wanted to make is that we have a family picture wall going back to the late 1800's. There is a picture of my wife's Great Grandmother standing on the porch at the cottage that was somewhere in The Thousand Islands. There is rope with about 20 fish strung on it. They are all Musky, large and small. It's all about perception. In 100 years someone may be dismayed about the 9 pound Walleye I took a picture of this summer, and ate.

Yes Ironmaker---you can google ""Leech Lake Rampage"" and also see a dock full of huge muskies hangin in the sun---from the 50's I believe  I also agree with your view on how relative killing one fish is compared to the countless atrocities happening daily in this world----somewhat why I asked a few questions and gave another angle----cuz it was apparently 4-5 pages of name calling and curious comments which Art has to remind people can be used them in a court of law  The web is not the local pub or schoolyard---and recent laws are regulating and scrutinizing it's usage more closely---check out the new and improved cyber bullying legislation---stemmed from tragic teenage suicides  And some of the tirades on certain groups based on Race/Religion or sexual orientation may fringe on Hate publications---another offence---do you want the court to decide that you were serious or not? If a Sask resident can be fined by The Supreme court of Canada for distributing ant-gay flyers as hate literature----is it worth it?  And at the end of the day I believe if the crap ever hits the fan---it will put our host TJ in a very awkward position---not the way to treat a friend ....no?  There are so very many things we can get angry with.....but anger does'nt solve the problem---there are channels to use if persistent and important enough to you  if it's not worth acting upon---is it worth driving your Blood pressure up over then?

871167,OhioFisherman,2014-09-07 15:44:00,6623," Ya, he's the bad twin  I  know a guy here in the Kawarthas that thinks exactly like the doofis in the video. He told me one day that I should kill all the muskies I catch rather than release them because their eating all the pickerel. I asked him how he knew this and he said it's obvious because 30 years ago their were plenty of pickerel and now there's hardly any left. I said the 2 species have lived together for eon's so howcum the muskies all of a sudden just ate them all in the last 30 years and of course he had no answer. When I said perhaps the pickerel are maybe being over fished by humans he said that was just stupid.  Tough to deal with some folks. The population of Ontario has at least doubled since the 1960's? and most of that probably centered in the southern portion? Since I am a geezer? I can remember when people didn't have to go too far into Ontario to catch walleye or have a real good chance at a 40 inch pike.  Fishing pressure has played a major role, and you had the cottage boom of the 50's, 60's, and 70's? The tourism boom over the same time period? We had to travel to catch walleye, Lake Erie didn't seem to have many?  Every camp I stayed at seemed to have a weekly fish fry for the guests, and then you can only wonder what the locals were doing? The people at their weekend retreats? A lot of the lakes in southern Ontario saw a huge growth in fishing pressure, not to mention boat traffic, shoreline construction and such?"
871169,Musky or Specks,2014-09-07 16:16:00,2710,". 3, he intentionally threw it back in the water which is wasting fish and is also a chargeable offence.    As a musky fisherman for over 20 yrs I've killed 2 illegal sized musky by accident from deep hooking. Unfortunately you have to throw them back even as you watch them sink to the bottom dead. When I've talked to CO's they will charge you with possesion if you keep it."

871229,singingdog,2014-09-07 23:01:00,1047,"I gotta weigh in here on this. Let me state clearly that the guy that did this is a dirtbag, and should be punished by the law. However, while we love to catch these wonderful fish, they are, in fact, just fish....my favorite fish, but still just fish. The threats of bodily harm to the dirtbag are way out of line. Would I have had some words with him?...definitely....but would I try to physically harm him?...no way.  Also, remember we don't go after these fish with velvet gloves and lollipops....look at your lures, your line strength, your hook set. Finally, how many of us debarb our hooks? I don't, and I'll bet most of you don't either.  Likely I'll be bombarded with this, but felt I needed to say it. I agree. The responses that threaten/suggest bodily harm to this guy are way out of line. It's just a fish."

871117,captpierre,2014-09-07 01:39:00,2521,What a fool.  They'll gettum  Social media will see to that
871119,OhioFisherman,2014-09-07 02:10:00,6623,"Sadly, people kill muskie thinking they are helping walleye populations. Another group kills pike to protect the muskie population. There is another type of creature that kils carp because they destroy bass and pike habitat. They are all idiots. http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/management/habitat.html  Fish habitat in many shallow lakes has been destroyed by carp and black bullheads. These fish root in the silty lake bottoms and stir up nutrient-laden sediment. The murky water blocks sunlight from reaching aquatic plants that stabilize the lake bottom and provide oxygen and habitat for game fish and water insects. Bluegills and bass numbers drop, while the seemingly indestructible bullheads and carp thrive in the gray-green soup."
871120,Steelheadphycho,2014-09-07 02:11:00,470,Epic d0uche-baggerie!  True ignorance.  Kudos to the fellas behind the film for approaching that tool and giving him a piece of all our minds.......
871122,AdamS,2014-09-07 02:31:00,161,Wow...It always amazes me how stupid some people really are. Fortunately there are people like those guys to catch them on video and share with the public.
871125,Handlebarz,2014-09-07 02:51:00,3790,I hope he gets what should come to him. It's sad to see people still doing disgusting things like this.
871126,landry,2014-09-07 03:00:00,1005,I am gonna go out on a limb here I wager that he likely has a rap sheet with worse offenses. He looks perty rough.
871136,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-07 06:00:00,8243,"I saw this video more than a few hours ago and have been seething over it since. I have a saying, stupidity is a DNA thing, lack of intellect is passed down from a shallow gene pool, being stupid isn't their fault, ignorance however is someone with some semblance of intellect that acts stupid. I think we have both at work here. I printed the pic of this knucklehead and his registration number on the boat. I will find out next week who this boat is registered to hopefully, it's probably stolen. 55E, where is that area? I think it might be Brantford area. Lets find this idiot. I hope social media kicks in here, it is a powerful investigative tool.  Wait, I know this person. He is the fisherman that guts a Salmon for it's eggs to let rot on the bank so he can catch another fish to do the same thing to. He is the guy that leaves his buck a beer 6 pack empties and plastic ring thrown in the bush after he's belched from empting them in 10 minutes. He throws the worm container on the ground along with the empty Horton's cup he needs to get sober a bit before he drives home too drunk. He's the guy that all the useless signs reminding us of proper social conduct are posted for, except he reads at a grade 1 level.  You know him too. He's your father, son, brother, cousin, neighbor or co worker. And he doesn't have a fishing or boaters license.  The worth of different species of fish, mammal, insect etc. are for another thread I believe."
871140,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-09-07 07:47:00,59,"People shoot thousands of carp in North America and let them rot... On video... All over YouTube... Only the carp anglers seam to care... 1 video of 1 musky being killed for no reason and everyone calls the MNR....  I'd like to see that kind if support for all species... Waste is waste no matter the species everyone...  Can't believe people still do things like this....  I've seen people do the same to Sheephead.  Catch it, swear, slit the belly and throw it back.  All while justifying it by cursing about how they just eat all the good fish as they are doing it.  It's mind boggling sometimes Mike."
871141,lew,2014-09-07 10:04:00,12766,"the guy looks like Lew's evil clone  Ya, he's the bad twin  I  know a guy here in the Kawarthas that thinks exactly like the doofis in the video. He told me one day that I should kill all the muskies I catch rather than release them because their eating all the pickerel. I asked him how he knew this and he said it's obvious because 30 years ago their were plenty of pickerel and now there's hardly any left. I said the 2 species have lived together for eon's so howcum the muskies all of a sudden just ate them all in the last 30 years and of course he had no answer. When I said perhaps the pickerel are maybe being over fished by humans he said that was just stupid.  Tough to deal with some folks."
871142,Gallie,2014-09-07 11:30:00,1215,This makes me sick. He should be smacked in the head with a paddle and thrown in the river.
871145,MuskieWannabe,2014-09-07 12:11:00,79,Very weird....Just turned on Dave Mercer this morning and he is jigging muskie in the exact same spot! Check it out on Sportsnet 360....Very weird. Very sad about the angler as well.
871146,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2014-09-07 12:24:00,535,"Sickening. I had a musky die on me for the first time this year. I was trolling a big jake, reel goes off so I grabbed the rod but see something is very wrong. The back hook is all that got him and unfortunately it hit his throat and opened it right up. Wasn't quite legal size either so nothing I could do with it, just a crappy feeling. I switched to fishing for another species and it was nearly two months before I finally went back out for musky. I've heard people talk about killing them so it doesn't surprise me but it's still absolutely disgusting. I couldn't imagine killing one on purpose for no reason. I feel terrible enough for having killed one by accident."
871147,lew,2014-09-07 12:40:00,12766,Very weird....Just turned on Dave Mercer this morning and he is jigging muskie in the exact same spot  That's a popular spot for jigging.
871148,bigcreekdad,2014-09-07 13:05:00,546,"I gotta weigh in here on this. Let me state clearly that the guy that did this is a dirtbag, and should be punished by the law. However, while we love to catch these wonderful fish, they are, in fact, just fish....my favorite fish, but still just fish. The threats of bodily harm to the dirtbag are way out of line. Would I have had some words with him?...definitely....but would I try to physically harm him?...no way.  Also, remember we don't go after these fish with velvet gloves and lollipops....look at your lures, your line strength, your hook set. Finally, how many of us debarb our hooks? I don't, and I'll bet most of you don't either.  Likely I'll be bombarded with this, but felt I needed to say it."
871150,lew,2014-09-07 13:14:00,12766,"  Likely I'll be bombarded with this, but felt I needed to say it.  I don't really think the issue is with him killing a musky as much as it's him intentionally killing an under sized musky."
871151,bigcreekdad,2014-09-07 13:15:00,546,Like I said Lew....he's a dirtbag.
871152,lew,2014-09-07 13:16:00,12766,Like I said Lew....he's a dirtbag.  I agree with you 100%
871158,Lape0019,2014-09-07 13:59:00,647,"There are a few things wrong with this. Depending on his license (if he even has one) if he has a conservation license, you wouldn't even be able to keep a musky. 2, he killed a fish under the slot size. 3, he intentionally threw it back in the water which is wasting fish and is also a chargeable offence.  I do not target musky but if it was over the slot size and he kept the fish, I would have no issue with him killing it. But because he is a dirtbag and purposely killed a fish and let it float away, I think he deserves to lose his fishing priveledges as well as receive some hefty fines. I hope we hear what the end result of this is.  Does anyone know what body of water this was on?"
871159,lew,2014-09-07 14:02:00,12766,Does anyone know what body of water this was on?  Detroit River at Windsor
871165,Walleye72,2014-09-07 15:03:00,156,What a scumbag!  It's a shame ignorant ideas such as this continue to exist.  I'm sure he'll get caught.  I wonder if he knows that he stars in a video?  It would be great to imagine him worried every time his doorbell rings.
871166,Pikeslayer,2014-09-07 15:43:00,1443,"Perhaps someone who lives in the general area could pass this along to the local newspapers??It would be most worthwhile to see this lowlife exposed in print (even with face & registration blurred). No doubt that friends, family, local tackle shops & community members would recognize this Scumbag and give him the gift that keeps on giving. PUBLIC DISGRACE.If I wasn't leaving for vacation, I'd be working so some creative wanted posters and mailing them to every tackle shop & marina in the greater Windsor area.This Scumbag disgusts me!!"
871080,Pigeontroller,2014-09-06 22:39:00,2793,"  I've called this in to the MNR tips line, if you find it as offensive as I do please do the same."
871082,hammercarp,2014-09-06 22:59:00,964,I just saw this. What a dick. Hard to believe this kind of ignorance still exists in the angling community.

871084,leaf4,2014-09-06 23:06:00,2466,"Wow !!!  I can't believe that and his mentality, ""so is smoking pot and everyone does that"" what kind of a lame brain is this guy??you'd think with the age he is he'd have a little more sense."
871085,mistaredone,2014-09-06 23:06:00,913,This is on all the FB groups and I'm sure it will go all around the community's. I hope we see justice done for this.
871087,wallyboss,2014-09-06 23:12:00,1095,Looks like he might've smoked some good pot (like everybody else according to him)
871088,kickingfrog,2014-09-06 23:14:00,8333,"A fool. Likely many in the circle of people who know him, knew his was a fool. Now that circle has gotten a whole lot bigger."

871110,ciceri,2014-09-07 01:08:00,535,"You guys were pretty calm about it, I think me and a couple people I Musky fish with would have a few more words to exchange with that guy. One of them would probably have him floating with that fish. I know its not the right way of handling it, but neither is what he did. He must have been on something other than ""pot"" to think that was okay and funny. I really hope people will start opening their eyes with this stuff, that guy is not a fisherman in any shape or form."
