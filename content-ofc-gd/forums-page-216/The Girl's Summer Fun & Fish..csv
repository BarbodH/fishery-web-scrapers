870777,ketchenany,2014-09-04 23:22:00,3229,"Moose that are some amazing places, the closest I've been  to Moose Factory is the Cochrane railway station station  or in one of my tourism magazines!  Way to go Lew, showing your age! You could have gone with Poleroid!"

870819,Moosebunk,2014-09-05 02:57:00,3970,Lew...  Simon... I do work... that can be kinda boring sometimes.  Thanks Doug.  I hear ya Mike... been a while since exploring that idea.  Ketchenany... you made it farther than most.
870838,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-05 04:05:00,8243,"I don't recall seeing some of your pics, you have a great eye my man, very impressed here. Fantastic report. You have a beautiful family. Those kids are as cute as a bugs ear. Be proud sir. Can you adopt me?  I need to put Ausable Chasm on my bucket list. Is it doable for someone waiting for 2 new knees? I'm not exactly I a wheelchair yet, I can walk 9 holes if I need to."
870843,Moosebunk,2014-09-05 09:27:00,3970,"I think the girls are pretty darned cute too... thanks Old I.  I need to put Ausable Chasm on my bucket list. Is it doable for someone waiting for 2 new knees? I'm not exactly I a wheelchair yet, I can walk 9 holes if I need to.  If you can walk 9... you can certainly do the main chasm.  They have it well set-up... and distance is about 1.5-2 miles I'd think.  Adding the dry chasms might be a little more difficult."
870844,spincast,2014-09-05 09:45:00,3279,"great recap MB. Love the shots of the Adirondacks - spent a year up in Oneonta  - amazing scenery, and you managed to capture the feel of the mountains. Its a spectacular place to be for fall colour change. Summer has really grown into a beautiful young lady - quickly!.  The shot with the mask had me doing a double take -"
870874,Pickeral eater,2014-09-05 13:41:00,155,That's a great recap of the summer.  Looks like one happy family!  I hope to be able to share moments like those with my daughter one day.  Congrats and awesome pics as well! Bill
871011,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-06 02:54:00,8243,"Thanks for the heads up Moosebunk. Talk about a small world, I show my wife the pics from Ausable this morning and tell her I would love to go next month, she tells me the sisters and herself stopped there on the way to Burlington 3 years ago on their annual getaway. Now I have a guide too!"
871161,Tomcat,2014-09-07 14:09:00,395,Great pics Drew! Thanks for sharing. My wife and I will be visiting the Lake Placid area again in early Oct to celebrate our 44 th.
871164,lew,2014-09-07 14:31:00,12766,"My wife and I will be visiting the Lake Placid area again in early Oct to celebrate our 44 th.  If Lums Restaurant is still in Lake Placid it'd be worth your time to give it a try, we've eaten there before and the food is outstanding....although we haven't been there in awhile."
871192,Tomcat,2014-09-07 19:44:00,395,"Hi Lew:  Thanks for the recommendation. I did a Google search on Lums Restaurants and it appears they went out of business. My son-in-law has completed two Ironman competitions in Lake Placid and we've there both times to support him. As well, my wife and I have traveled to Lake Placid to celebrate previous anniversaries. Two restaurants we can recommend are The Hungry Trout near Wilmington (30 minute drive from Lake Placid) and The Great Adirondack Steak and Seafood restaurant on Main Street in Lake Placid."
