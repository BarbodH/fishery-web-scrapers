871363,mirogak,2014-09-08 19:25:00,387,"Been a while since I have posted a report.  Actually it has been quite a while since I have done some real fishing as well.  This year I hadn't been to my favourite park for some real fishing, so I decided to go the weekend after Labour Day.  What a great decision to not go on a long weekend.  Peace, tranquility, scenery, fishing was just great.  Below are some pics.  I was targetting Specks using this new technique but I ended up with lakers.  Hey, I don't mind.  I love trout.  I actually thought I had specks until I fillet two for dinner, at which point I looked for the signs - forked tails vs square tail, and the worm like markings versus the halo spots.  Ofcourse, how could i forget that beautiful Speck I caught a couple years back.  Anyhow, was there for the weekend.  Hooked 8 fish on two tries, landed 7, kept 2 for dinner.  Peace out, hope you all had a great summer.  Miro          "
871367,jimmer,2014-09-08 19:35:00,2730,Thanks for sharing with us. Tasty looking lakers. I haven't been to the Park in sometime now; kind of miss it.
871413,chris.brock,2014-09-08 22:07:00,4053,Nice Miro!  Did you hike in or portage? How deep were the lakers?
871420,mirogak,2014-09-08 22:28:00,387,"Chris, I was fishing 30 feet spots. Miro"
871421,mirogak,2014-09-08 22:28:00,387,And I portaged.
871458,chris.brock,2014-09-09 00:44:00,4053,"cool, one complaint, next report, give us more than 4 pics (smiley face)"
871460,mirogak,2014-09-09 00:47:00,387,"Hahaha. Though that before procrastination gets the better of me, I post this while it's fresh. I hope to add more to it. I totally agree."
871493,Joeytier,2014-09-09 05:47:00,3990,Awesome!  Very scenic lake with a nice bounty of trout to boot!  Solo trip?
871494,solopaddler,2014-09-09 08:44:00,8605,Well done Miro! Were you trolling with a 3-way rig with a heavy bell sinker on the dropper?
871502,Musky or Specks,2014-09-09 10:26:00,2710,Yes Miro curious on your new technique?
871538,mirogak,2014-09-09 14:04:00,387,"Me and a couple of buddies went on a canoe trip with 2 small portages but long paddles. Only two of us fished.  My technique is a culmination of almost 2 years of failed trolling efforts, observations, research and consultations with other anglers (including a retired marine biologist in the park).  I basically troll really slow with a LOT of line out with a spoon.  That's it.  Other factors to consider: That's it.  Miro"
