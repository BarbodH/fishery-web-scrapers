871065,mike rousseau,2014-09-06 17:09:00,4661,Hello all  My cover isn't exactly keeping all the water out... Is there a good product/spray to seal her back up again or should I shop for a new one?   Thanks  Mike
871067,spincast,2014-09-06 17:26:00,3279,you can buy liquid silicone at CTC in the camping section (or you used to be able to - haven't looked for it in a few years) . If you spray it on once or twice a year it should do the trick.  I used it lots when I did a lot of  camping and tents started to weep; cured it every time.

I do 2 foot square sections at a time and mark it off with blackboard chalk as it doesn't show a wet edge. Cover is 19 years old. Paint on sealer has been suggested to me but the Scotch Guard has worked and if it ain't broke I don't mess with something. If and when she won't bead any longer I will get a travel cover for her and save on the shrinkwrap."

You should wash the cover before you waterproof it.  You can machine wash it, but you should rinse it twice since hte detergent will prevent the waterproofing from working as well.  Once its dry I use a deck sprayer to spray my canvas then let it dry well."

I want to do my cover and carpets in this stuff.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DZrjXSsfxMQ  I think I read yesterday that this may not be the best for boat covers and it can change the colour of the cover. Someone said it changes the colour to white. Haven't tried it myself but just so you know.
871130,mike rousseau,2014-09-07 04:10:00,4661,I was thinking about using that stuff... The never wet...  I don't care at all what the cover looks like to be honest so I don't mind a color change...
871131,mike rousseau,2014-09-07 04:12:00,4661,But I don't wanna spend $50 a year waterproofing a cover I can replace for $250-300
871132,mike rousseau,2014-09-07 04:13:00,4661,I think I'll get a new one when I replace the floor in my boat...
