Trolling just outside of the rivermouth in the dirty water. 20-40ft depths.  Firetiger pike spoon on lead core 150ft back    An Atlantic on a dipsey,  spin dr/fly tipped with an anchovie (forgot the meat rig hooks at home had to improvise)     This fish hit right off the Bow of the Ridgeway as I was reeling in the second last rod to go home.  Very clean fish.    Same Dipsey spin/dr fly combo as above (no anchovie) 10ft down in 20ft of water  Thanks to my sister Liz for taking the wheel.    My son Reilly with an Atlantic.  Dipsey, Spin Dr/meat rig with anchovie.  Unfortunately, he lost a good king boatside but he enjoyed a good fight before it bent the hook and got away.                       "

871663,BillM,2014-09-10 02:06:00,17367,No need to use riggers in 40ft of water when you've got dipsys.   Great job man!  That Atlantic is gorgeous!
871667,Gallie,2014-09-10 02:26:00,1215,Nice fish!

Those are mighty fine fish you got there. Do most folks keep or release these fish? I bet 90% of the Walleye here are all kept. We release all others than maybe 1 rainbow per trip or may keep a few Silvers if they come from deep water and the bladder is blown. Actually caught a Coho last month that I thought was a Bow."

871684,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-10 06:34:00,8243,"What's a boot Freshtrax? I have now caught 2 Salmon in my life, 30 years or so apart and I don't know Salmon lingo. The 10 pound Coho last month and  my first ever and only other was a 32 pound King on a charter out of Burlington in around 83'. I really didn't appreciate it when it happened, but was on the board for a week or so in the newspaper. I figured if I got one on my first turn on the rod ever everyone else must get them that big. I remembered my uncle from NY telling stories about them fishing out of Lewiston NY, if you think it got off keep reeling like a mad man, it's running towards the boat, he was right, both times but 30 years apart."

871688,spincast,2014-09-10 09:10:00,3279,atta boy. Nice going. that third fish is a nice fatty
871690,fishindevil,2014-09-10 09:29:00,6254,"Nice fish well done !!!!! That Atlantic is awesome  glad to see someone had the inshore trolling pattern all figured out !!!! Have you tried running in-line boards that shallow ?? Run them tight to the shore side with a ghost xrap about  60ft back and do a few ""S"" turns from 15-40 fow or run a flatfish/kik fish in skunk color or silver/ green or blue and you will be wailing on them !!!! Thanks for sharing !!!  I miss doing that in the fall .... Awesome fishing"
