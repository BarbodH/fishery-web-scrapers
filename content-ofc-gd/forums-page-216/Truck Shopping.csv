870923,Joeytier,2014-09-05 19:42:00,3990,"I think this thread pretty well proves that every company is making a pretty good truck these days.  I love my new and old Sierra's, but I've driven pretty well all the late model halftons out there, and was impressed with all of them.  It does seem like Ford is making the most fuel-efficient gas v8 right now with their 5.0 L, but I can't stand the way they look lol!  If you're buying used, pay more mind to how well it was taken care of, not what brand it is."
870940,pike slayer,2014-09-05 21:50:00,1177,All the brands are making a decent truck now days. They all have their issues so research and pick with what you'd rather deal with.
871016,FloatnFly,2014-09-06 04:16:00,1640,"look around at independent lots as well, I bought my truck from one, hes a customer at work who buys the cars/trucks for the dealer, he now works for a chrysler dealer, buying their cars from auction for their used car lot.  but i have a 2005 f150 fx4 with a step side, paid 14,000 for it, im the second owner, the first one being a ford employee in quebec, I bought it 3 years ago with 52,000kms on it.  I love the thing, its not horrible on gas, but its far from the best, the happy zone is around 90km/h, you can hold it there, $50 will take you about 300km ( got to wiarton, found out I left my bank card at home in oshawa, and only $50 on me lol)  but to be honest, you don't buy a truck for the gas milage, you buy it to use the box to move crap around, and for towing heavy trailer loads.  another tip, don't look at anything other than 4x4, 2 wheel drive sucks, especially in a PU since they are rear wheel drive, you have to put sand bags or patio stones in the bed to weigh it down for traction.  before deciding on a pickup, make a list on paper on what you NEED your vehical to do, ie do you need to pack up a load of lumber or supplies every so often, is that something you don't do.  for myself i wanted the exterior cargo capacity for my fishing gear, i didn't want the smell of my waders/boots or fish on the inside of my vehical, plus I do load up the bed at least once or twice a month.  if you don't need it to do any of the above, look into the SuVs the edge and escape are very nice, as are the grand caravans and journeys.  what ever you decide, make sure it is something that you are going to be happy driving and that it suits your lifestyle"
871038,aplumma,2014-09-06 13:28:00,6896,All the trucks have good and bad points so the truck should be the one you like. The big differences is how are you treated when there is an issue that is either under warranty or just out of warranty. I have owned all of the US brands as well as a Nissan truck and of these Nissan failed to warranty an issue that I felt they should have. I have been a Ford man because they have gone over and above what was needed on any issues I have had on my Fords. Going into debt for something should be weighted on whether or not you have the ability to easily handle the debt if something else in life goes wrong. I personally pay cash for my vehicle now because I set aside money every month for the next vehicle we need to replace. With time if you save the money before hand it is like getting thousands of dollars off in interest that you are not paying on the loan.  Best of luck on your search  Art.

Gm owners are starting to think the resale value is the same as toyota trucks. I had to be different and buy a truck that wasnt apart of the big 3.

GM is more expensive to buy but less to repair, F-150 is less expensive to buy but more to repair, Rams eat up brakes, etc. I do like the new Ram with the 8 speed, but again, it involves one of those loans."

I take care of my trucks, cars and boat and do the proper maintenance. I currently own and drive a 2008 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT package that has 99500 miles on it and is in perfect condition and have had zero problems. I also have a 2002 Chevy Silverado 1500 LS package that has 260,000 miles on it and besides tires, brakes and oil changes the only things that I have issues with it was a fan unit that was replaced at 125K, a set for U joints at 150K, a fuel pump at 175k  and just recently a alternator. The 2002 is probably my favorite ride of all time because of where it has taken me with minimal problems and I wouldn't think twice about hooking up my boat and pulling it north for a trip. My work has had me behind the wheels of Fords and Dodges but my personal preference is a Chevy"

Well I wouldn't put it that way 100%.  I had 2 Chevs and will never have another.  We had 3 1/2 tons at work that rattled and shook and uncomfortable for me.  I don't like their seats, I like to be more upright.   I don't mind the older Fords, they were reliable and took quite a beating.  The newer ones are okay except I don't like the lowness of the steering even with it adjusted all the way up.  They ride nice and quiet and aren't bad on gas.  The 3 2011 Dodges have the 4.7 and are gas pigs.  Other than that, they work every day without any problems other than regular maintenance.  3/4 and 1 tons like to eat front suspension parts but the transmission (stick) and Cummins just can't be beat.  I've never owned a Toyo, a little pricey.  As for Nissans, after my sons debacle with his, I sure won't go looking for one."

Depending on your towing needs, the new ecotec 4.3's in the new Sierra make for a real nice 'budget' package, alongside the Pentastar Ram w/ the 8-speed.  I prefer the v8's and all 3 companies make good ones, just decide what trim level you're looking for and price check from there"

Mine has the auto 4x4 option which is good as its there when you need it and saves on gas. I get around 650km a tank.

869780,DanD,2014-08-28 11:19:00,2223,"If you're looking at used stuff and when you find one you're really interested in; take it into an independent garage that has no association with the people selling it. It doesn't matter whether the vehicle has been safety checked & E tested; get it checked, it may give you some bargaining power on the price tag. I'm not saying the seller might be trying to hide stuff; but things like tires can legally pass inspection, as long as two adjacent ware bars are not touching the road. That means new tires for you in a couple of months. Brake pads are another example, they can be worn down to 3mm of friction material remaining and pass inspection; but that means new brakes in 1 - 2 months. I have had some of my customers save a bunch of money on their purchase; just by having me go over the vehicle before any commitments were made. Fix it or drop the price. All I'm saying is that a safety inspection is not a warrantee; all it means is that on the day of inspection the vehicle passed all minimum requirements set out by the MTO. Requirements that were written 30 plus some odd years ago.  Dan."

869807,scugpg,2014-08-28 15:33:00,1373,"I would look at the ram with the v8 and 8 speed transmission or the Sierra with 5.3.  One thing to note, if you aren't towing huge amounts the Sierra with 5.3l and the 3.08 gear ratio would get considerably better economy than other ratios.  Interior wise the ram blows everything else away IMO and the 8"" u connect screen is very nice to use."

It had been well maintained, mechanically (new transmission, brake work, alternator, etc), the body was another thing. A hole on the cab corner, serious rust under the quarters in the front (not seriously visible by looking but very evident when grabbed with the hand). This truck has 313,000 k on it. Nice guy selling it, but asking $5900. I might as well stick with my 98 Ranger and the same amount of rust."
869986,leaf4,2014-08-29 14:13:00,2466,"That's the thing about buying vehicles in that age bracket, you risk taking someone else's problems and making them your own, my first car was 6 years old and had 147,000 when I bought it. I only paid $4850 for it and it lasted me 5 1/2 years it was a good vehicle for a time until I decided it was not worth putting any more money into.  I just purchased a 2011 tucson still under factory warranty and couldn't be happier, especially when I end up buying a boat of my own in a couple years I'll be able to tow with it and maintain good mileage when not towing, although a truck would be nice but I'm thinking mileage as I still use it to commute, I only paid $14,990 for it with 94k on it, and there were AWD options in the 16k price range I was considering also but ended up liking the one I bought more than the rest."
