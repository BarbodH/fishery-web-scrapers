866089,Sour_Squirrel,2014-08-02 20:27:00,196,"I have a 2008 diesel Cherokee and when towing my boat (Lund Explorer 1675 with an E-Tec 90) I get between 13.5-14.8 l/100 km. Most of my fishing trips are between Toronto (city driving, DVP and 401) and Stony Lake.  Last trip I averaged 14.2 l/100 km with a fully loaded boat, gear, three adults and the A/C on. So a brand new RAM 1500 diesel with those mileage numbers are impressive !!"
866092,tb4me,2014-08-02 20:41:00,3295,I was just looking at one of these today..Sure makes the Hemi look like a greedy bugger...
866103,scugpg,2014-08-02 22:07:00,1373,I took a diesel gc out recently and got 7-9 l/100 on the highway 100kmh so not surprised to see those truck numbers! Lots of power too. Although I took a 5.7 Durango out with the 8spd and also got decent mileage around 9-11 highway 80kmh. Wonder if it's that 8spd making some significant difference along with lower rpms due to gear ratio?
866122,BillM,2014-08-03 02:17:00,17367,Those trannys absolutely make a big impact on mileage.
866135,hutch4113,2014-08-03 12:19:00,374,"The Transmission does make a big difference.  It was another reason why I bought it.  The 8 Speed, in combo with the Diesel is just about perfect.  Always keeps it in the sweet spot, which is around 1900 -> 2000 RPM."

867103,Raf,2014-08-11 18:57:00,3495,"Man, that's a lot of gas.  Apples and Oranges since my boat/trailer/motor is propably 1000-1200 lbs and your package I'd estimate at 3000-3500 with fuel but I got a hand calculated 22.5 us mpg or 10.5 L / 100 towing mine to sudbury and back to orangeville in my 08 Grand Cherokee 3.0L Diesel.  That same trip unloaded, I would be scratching 25mpg."

871816,scugpg,2014-09-10 21:08:00,1373,"For comparison sake I recently towed around a 950lb load, mostly 401/35 on the trip with a v6 escape 4x4 and got 10.3 l/100 kms. So the mileage your getting is awesome with the big truck and much bigger load!"
865225,hutch4113,2014-07-28 19:19:00,374,"The diesel thread I opened earlier seemed really hot, so thought I would post my first low tow experience.  Just got back from the Cottage - was really looking forward to this trip, as it would be the first long tow with the Diesel (well - long for me anyway).Trip was 530KM - round trip. Average speeds of 110KM to 90KM. 1/2 the trip on twisty, hilly (and sometimes very hilly) terrain. Estimate I was probably close to 5000 pounds all said and done, with the boat, plus all the stuff in the bed/cab.  I do have to stress this is an estimate, and might be on the highside - I know the boat is about 2200 pounds dry (which I assume is no motor) - it was fully gassed before we started the journey.  I guess one day I will have to get it weighed fully loaded so I know for sure.Normally with the previous tow vehicle (Veracruz - V6 AWD) I could expect to fill up twice - going up, and then coming back. With the Truck, I am still at just under 1/2 a tank, which is nice.Ran in Tow/Haul mode there an back. Also used Cruise Control, which I don't normally do when towing, unless the terrain is flat.Average is showing 11.8 L/KM or about 24 MPG. Overall very happy with how it performed. Never really noticed the trailer - Truck had plenty of power. Even on some of the steep hills - it just pulled and pulled with out a lot of fuss."
865239,lookinforwalleye,2014-07-28 19:59:00,4399,24 mpg towing and fully loaded is awesome!
865242,Raf,2014-07-28 20:06:00,3495,that's imperial MPG not US MPG but still nice considering the load.  about 20 US MPG.
865259,Sinker,2014-07-28 21:42:00,8692,"Thats great mileage for a full size truck with a load. Im seriously considering this truck, but im not going to pull the trigger just yet.  S."
865264,Joeytier,2014-07-28 21:58:00,3990,Very impressive!
865298,kuhaman,2014-07-29 00:11:00,503,"About 12 litres per 100 k, that's better than my Taco with no load"
865303,leaf4,2014-07-29 00:45:00,2466,"That's impressive, I can see myself being interested in one of these in a couple years from now once I'm finished my trade license and can make enough for a new car, house and toys haha. If not this, by then I would hope more mid size trucks would have a diesel option by then, fingers crossed haha"
865308,Wagoneer,2014-07-29 01:08:00,118,Anything under 15L/100km for a light-duty with a load is incredible!  I've been saying for years and years they need to start putting small diesels in their light duties. NA gas engines just make zero sense in trucks.
865316,Skud,2014-07-29 01:30:00,739,"Yeah, that is really good mileage. My F150 is at 14.6L per hundred with no weight."
865345,Walleye72,2014-07-29 03:37:00,156,"Wow.  That fuel economy is pretty impressive.  On my recent trip from London to near Sturgeon Falls I would say I averaged approximately 14.5 - 15 L/100 km.   I was towing a Tracker Proguide V16 WT which I would estimate the weight including the crap I added to be approx 2300 - 2400 lbs.   I towed it with a 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe  2.0 litre  TURBO.   I thought that was  a little high, but I have nothing to go on for previous experience.  The car gets about 8 L/100 km  when not towing.  It's all those bloody hills that kill my mileage.  Thanks for posting your experience."
865348,Joeytier,2014-07-29 04:20:00,3990,"Yeah, I'm lucky if I can keep my sierra (5.3) under 15 /100 (avg...mostly driving around town and bush roads)"
865370,hutch4113,2014-07-29 12:28:00,374,"that's imperial MPG not US MPG but still nice considering the load.  about 20 US MPG.  Oups - Yes.  it was 20MPG.  I was right the first time, but then changed it."
865371,BillM,2014-07-29 12:32:00,17367,"Nice, wait until you actually get some mileage on that truck should go up a bit"
865378,bigbuck,2014-07-29 12:56:00,2449,"That is impressive. It is a real world report, 630km round trip. Hmmmmmmm......"
865386,d_paluch,2014-07-29 13:20:00,343,"That is nuts!  Wish I could afford one though. Until then, the little mazda3 will have to tow my 14ft aluminum. Does a surprising good job, but man does my mileage suck when towing haha"
865402,doubleheader,2014-07-29 13:48:00,497,"I purchased a Ram 2500HD with a Cummins diesel this spring. Never thought I'd be in a Ram when i started my research, but, Ram has come a long way. I love mine. It's the first vehicle I ever purchased where I couldn't find a single defect or minor blemish anywhere and I haven't had a single quality issue in the first 3 months of ownership.  Taking our first trip in a couple weeks and I can't wait to hit the road. Congrats on your truck, Your mileage is awesome. I'll be pulling a pretty heavy rig, a 1900 Pro-v and 200 Verado, loaded with 2 weeks of vacation supplies. I'll be very happy with 15 mpg, and I think I'll get that no problem based on local towing trips."

Curious to see our fuel eco this weekend; 3000 km round trip with JJCanoe's 2012 Ram towing my boat. The only difference between his and mine cab/bed size but we'll have 4 guys and gear for a week. If we get better eco in his, I'm setting mine on fire!!!"
865899,Raf,2014-08-01 01:59:00,3495,That is gross slowpoke. How big is your boat? Last time I was at chrysler dealer they said they were looking for\paying a premium (whatever that means) for late model rams along with gcs for trade.  Might be something to look at as long it makes sense economically.

But the more research I did took me away from it - it is fine in regular driving, and actually can get some impressive numbers due to cylinder deactivation, etc.  But towing - not so much."
