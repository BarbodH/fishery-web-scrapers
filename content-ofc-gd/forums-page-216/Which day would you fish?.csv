871303,Master of Bait,2014-09-08 12:59:00,196,"Hi folks,  I'm fishing the Bancroft area with some pals this coming weekend and it looks like a front is moving in. We can fish one day, sat or sun, and the weather looks like: Thurs: 19, showers, 20 km sw wind Fri: 16, cloudy periods, 5 km north wind Sat: 13, cloudy periods, 10 km north wind Sun: 14, sunny, clear sky, 5 km east wind Then things level out and hover at this temp for a week or so.  So my question, would you rather fish Saturday or Sunday?  Also, I always find the dropping temps harder to interpret during the fall. Do you see this as a typical cold front situation where the fish shut down, or rather cooling fall temps that are part of a regular seasonal pattern?  Many thanks for reading,  MoB"
871316,bow slayer,2014-09-08 14:49:00,1074,"saturday for me just because the wind direction,less sun and more chop  probably tough either day with the temp drop and rain from thursday."
871337,Joeytier,2014-09-08 16:24:00,3990,"Since the front is coming thru thursday, i would say friday would be the tougest bite, so go out both days!"
871373,davey buoy,2014-09-08 19:51:00,5505,"Maybe a day/or 3 later,we had that big storm Friday here.Went out Sunday ,all kinds of fish,no takers.Not my first time there ,but seems their bite was off.Mind you that was a big system that went through on the Friday.Good luck any day you go,I'd pick a day and just go with the less wind.imo."

871406,Master of Bait,2014-09-08 21:50:00,196,"Thanks for the feedback folks/  Keep it coming!  On the topic, how would you target largies in these conditions?  I'm thinking deep weedline edges, jigs presented slooowly.  Any other suggestions?  It's Paudash lake, near Bancroft.  I'm pretty pumped about getting out as I haven't fished much at all this year (we have two young kids and we moved this summer, so the season was a bit of a write off).  Seems the clear sky and low, east wind on Sunday would make that the worst of the two days, but it's also further removed from the initial temperature drop.  What to do, what to do..."
871417,misfish,2014-09-08 22:23:00,29133,"  How about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  JUST FISH."
871422,Master of Bait,2014-09-08 22:29:00,196,That's a given
871425,misfish,2014-09-08 22:33:00,29133,"That's a given  Well then,there ya go.  Have fun,be safe and look forward to a report when you return."
871426,Big Cliff,2014-09-08 22:56:00,6899,"I would be looking at Sunday, the front will have settled in by then. Depending on time of day, you'll probably want to be changing presentations and locations. Early and late in the day I'd probably be working surface, near structure, shallow (stumps etc.) Mid day I'd be looking for some shoals and fishing the shaded side of those using either live bait or plastics, real simple and fished slow. Down size your presentation, the bite isn't likely to be very agressive."
871450,BillM,2014-09-09 00:31:00,17367,Sunday would be the day I pick...
871482,Steve,2014-09-09 02:21:00,2075,"Paudash?  Do the Sunday.  Hit the docks. Fish will be under with the high sun.  Of course, it's only Monday. That forcast will change five times from now till then."
871491,mattaw,2014-09-09 04:04:00,162,"I'll be in the area all weekend, out both days of course, I personally like it a bit overcast with a bit of chop, but it's a toss up, if you can just fish both"
871498,fishindevil,2014-09-09 09:33:00,6254,That's perfect weather for chasing big smallies !!! Even with the cold front !!! And the wind is even better !!!! I prefer that kind of weather for chasing brown fish !!!!! Gets the fish moving around and they are starting to put the fall feed  bag on !!! You are not going to catch any bass sitting in the cottage staring out the window !!!! And any day you get a chance to go fishing regardless of the weather is a great day !!! Get out there

871500,solopaddler,2014-09-09 09:47:00,8605,"I'm kind of surprised some of you are choosing Sunday. Obviously fish when you can, but if that forecast is accurate Saturday would be my choice. More cloud and winds from the north. Clear skies and east winds on Sunday doesn't sound quite as appealing."
871542,mirogak,2014-09-09 14:21:00,387,I agree with Mike.  I would have chosen Fri but Sat is my second choice.
871593,Steve,2014-09-09 18:58:00,2075,"I know that lake well.  when the sun is high, the bass move into their predictable hiding spots.  when it is overcast, there is a ton of off shore structure that spreads them out.  all our best days on Paudash have come with high blue skies."
