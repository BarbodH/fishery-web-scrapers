870760,gordy28,2014-09-04 22:04:00,638,"The Background  About 18 months ago our group started discussing a trip for Aug 2014  Leveraged many of the expert opinions on this board  and those who go out of their way to post reports - I used many in my research  - special thanks to Mike Borger, Fishlogic, Moosebunk and Chris Brock  We looked at many options and many locations - and after many chats decided that we really wanted to try a fly in outpost experience with a few qualifiers...  We wanted to be able to drive there in under 11 hours, the camp had to have a generator, running water and indoor plumbing and we wanted a numbers lake w big fish potential  After chatting with many great outfitters, soliciting feedback from others and balancing that against our criteria we decided we chose White River Air and specifically their deluxe camp on Pickle Lake  Pickle is a smaller lake, about 2 miles (split by a very shallow narrows) and 3/4 of a mile wide located about 40 miles  from White River Air's base on Tukanee Lake   The Journey We met up early on the Friday to begin our trek up - our plan was to make enjoy the ride but get to White River as soon as we could.  A not so quick stop in the Sault to pick up a flat of worms at the Trading Post (thanks Adam) and score a few secret lures (very helpful gentlemen in the shop knew Pickle specifically and gave us the great tip of stocking up on metallic jig heads and harnesses due to the dark stain in the lake)  Once we got past the Sault it was an eye opener for 4 guys who had never been past Sudbury on 17 - the views along Superior were incredible and the ride flew - until we got stuck an hour outside of Wawa with a crash and sat on the highway for 2.5 hours...  We checked into the White River Motel @ 9:00 PM - headed to our cottage for the night, a few pops, excited discussion and it was time for bed  Up early - ready to be at the Air Base for 8 - get there, pay our bill and head down to the dock to talk to Dan - head honcho at White River Air and Chief Pilot - Dan said we wouldn't be going out until 10:30ish  - so we headed back into town for breakfast and one more supply run at the local gas station (we also met a fellow OFNer LocoGringo  coming out from his trip - nice to meet you!)  We actually were finally on the plane at 11:45  The Flight I have to admit - I was nervous about the flight- so was my brother - our running joke was to hum or sing a few lines from 50 Mission Cap to each other  Our gear was weighed along with our beer - Dan had been great with us - from the get go I was honest and said as newbies I couldn't see us coming in under the 125lb per man weight limit - we wanted to know how much the overage charge was - but Dan said not to worry, he'd get us in and we wouldn't be charged.  Sure enough we were well over - but Dan didn't blink - our group of 4 plus another group of two were loaded up onto the Turbo Otter and we took off  Other than being a bit claustrophobic in the beginning (I was up near the front of the plane, squished between two large back and front and wedged against a mountain of gear and the window side to side) I thought it was awesome  15 minutes later we touched down on Pickle lake - and unloaded ourselves and helped the departing group load up.  Pickle Lake I could go on for hours about the nuances of our time on the lake - in a nutshell it was incredible  We had a cabin that had hot and cold running water, 2 generators (1 for the pump, 1 for the cabin), 6 beds plus a futon (my home for the week) for 4 guys with a kick ass patio overlooking the lake w a front seat view of sunrise and sunset  Our boats for the week were serviceable 14 foot lunds with 6 horsepower Yamaha two stokes - no issues at all with the engines but there was another boat and motor on site  The Fishing The fishing was also spectacular  - for us at least.  There is a very healthy population of walleye (mainly 12 - 16 inches) in Pickle and an abundance of snot rocket to mid size pike.   We had planned to eat a lot of fish in our meal plan - and within our first our on the lake we already had 6 14 - 17 inchers ready for the next day's fish fry  We didn't keep track of our numbers but a fair estimate would be 60 fish per day between 2 boats - this number dropped once we realized we could catch dinner fish or small pike whenever we wanted and started focusing on bigger fish  The lake has two bays to the southwest and northwest of the cabin where you could troll down the middle w a rapala or run into the reed and cabbage beds and catch pike all day long  In the main lake the deepest part was 47 feet with an average basin of 30 feet - eventually we would figure out that focusing on the steepest breaks with the wind into them was our best tactic for walleye - either jigging, drifting with a bottom bouncer and harness or trolling bouncers and crank baits  Our biggest 3 walleye for the week were Our biggest pike was 33 inches caught trolling a minnow bait Top producing baits for us were  There are two parts to the lake - and since we were so busy exploring the first part - I don't think we gave the other section (getting to it was a bit of a pain as the boats didn't have shallow drive) - it has a deep basin in one bay that is 60 feet deep  We did catch respectable walleye and pike in that section - but we only fished it for 4 or 5 hours max  The Wrap Up Our trip out was delayed by a day – the plane couldn’t pick us up due to fog and a very low ceiling – we unpacked a bit and headed back out to fish – for fun and for dinner.  We actually got onto a good larger fish bite – and my bro picked up the second biggest walleye of the trip @ 25 inches (sadly  - think this is when we finally put the last piece of the bigger fish puzzle in place)  We were out the next day early but alas our delayed departure wasn’t done- car trouble outside of Thessalon and a 4 hour wait for a tow, then rental car pick up, gear switch meant an expected arrival of Saturday at 11 PM turned into a 6 AM arrival on Monday  I will honestly say that it didn’t diminish the trip for any of us though – yes it was a pain, added some pressure on the home front – but we had enjoyed ourselves so much it was just a bump on the road – not a trip killer  Things Learned:  We do these trips every two years - so 2016 will be another fly in - maybe further north -Nakina, Armstrong, Red Lake - but we have lots of time to plan – our challenge will be we are far from roughing it – when polled we all felt like a generator, running water and indoor plumbing are a must for our group  - realizing we prob limit our options that way – but that’s cool – I have already begun my research J Again many thanks to all of the members of the forum who answered questions and provided advice – special thanks to Mike Borger who sent numerous emails, offered  tips - it was extremely helpful.  Also Fishlogic – the worm set up in the Frabill Habitat using the Fat and Sassy pre made bedding (and the reco to use the Trading Post) was awesome Cheers Gordy  Here are a few pictures of the trip: The Cabin and the Group   The Plane Ride  Our view off the patio in the AM and Evening  Fish Pics - first 2 walleyes are our largest         And finally - a dusk fish shot- my favourite part of any trip "
870762,mattybculp,2014-09-04 22:17:00,388,Sounds like a great time had by all. That's a beauty walleye
870763,NAW,2014-09-04 22:19:00,4022,I can't see the pics for some reason.  But if it's the same Pickle Lake I am thinking of (a small town 10 hour north of T-Bay..??) Than I used to live there as a young child.  Not sure why I can't see your pics.  Great report man!
870767,Moosebunk,2014-09-04 22:26:00,3970,"Really enjoyed that Gordy!  Great to hear of any fly-in reports like this, but especially so when it's something new for those who experienced it.  Your walleye numbers were good with some solid fish too.  That is a pretty small lake overall and it treated you well.  In future you will find many fly-ins like this one are equally productive.  It's a great and funny feeling when you can just sit back in the boat and set the hook into walleye after walleye like they're spring perch or crappies loaded up in a sweet spot.  Thanks for the report.  Try not to wait two years, so git'er done in 2015 dood.  These are days you carry with you forever."
870771,chris.brock,2014-09-04 22:40:00,4053,"I don't think Chris should be mentioned in the same sentence as Mike, Drew and Adam, but cool!  Yep, you guys are officially hooked! The first one is the most magical, and the planning is half the fun. It is more work than a lodge but the feeling sitting around the campfire at the outpost, after dark, after a great day on the water, more than makes up for that.  Maybe Bill Barilko just loved it so much, he disappeared and stayed there."
870772,davey buoy,2014-09-04 22:40:00,5505,"Great report Gordy,looks like a good time as said.Love the way you broke down the trip.too bad you have to wait two more years!!"
870773,Joeytier,2014-09-04 22:52:00,3990,"Awesome report, and very informative write-up!  Does the outfitter supply minnows, if requested?"
870788,solopaddler,2014-09-05 00:30:00,8605,"Great report bud, I know how much this trip was anticipated!! It sounds as though despite a couple of set backs you had a good time and I'm glad!! FWIW that's very unusual for Dan to say 8am then not flyn until 11:30. They're usually super prompt. I've flown with him twice this year and both times we showed up at the airbase at 7am and were in the air at 7:30."
870789,solopaddler,2014-09-05 00:30:00,8605,"Awesome report, and very informative write-up! Does the outfitter supply minnows, if requested?  You don't need them."
870793,limeyangler,2014-09-05 00:53:00,5204,Fantastic read.  Colors on those fish is amazing.  Thank you for taking the time to post this.
870847,spincast,2014-09-05 10:07:00,3279,"awesome.    Great memories built there, OFC is a great resource for finding a place to get away and set the hook. I still have quite a few recommendations from some of the same folks you listed there that I have to work through."
870861,gordy28,2014-09-05 12:36:00,638,"Thanks all Can't seem to quote on the iPad but will try to answer all questions  This pickle lake isn't the town north of tbay it's a small lake about 40 miles north of white river ont  Chris as one of the more active trip reporters you provided a wealth of insight  Would love to do a trip annually but our deal at home is to alternate between bigger family trips and fishing trips while kids are young  White river air doesn't sell bait but there is a bait shop in white river.  To mikes point we didn't need them tipping w worms worked just as well  I hear ya about the delays mike hopefully it was just a busy day  In terms of the colours of the fish one cool thing was that we caught a bunch of ""blue walleye"". Very cool  Thanks for all the comments and glad people enjoyed it Gordy"
870863,RickOnt,2014-09-05 12:39:00,669,"Hey Gordy  Great report and well done on the ""Fishing""  Fly ins are addictive!!  LOL  You do have to deal with weight limitations,  Its pretty hard to come in under 100 lbs per man if you are bringing in beer at 22lbs a case. Great your outfitter was accommodating  I look for that when I am researching.  Weather will effect your flight times, Not much you can do about Mother Nature  BUT  When the float plane leaves you on 'your' Lake  Its is a very special feeling,  I can't wait til next time!!  Cheers Rick"
870873,adempsey,2014-09-05 13:37:00,1498,"Sounds like a great trip regardless of the little bumps.   Those smiles in the photos really say it all!  Thanks for spending the time to put together and post your trip report.  It's always nice to get a taste of the adventure from places we may never get to experience for ourselves.    Also, I have a list of outposts with indoor toilets if you want it!! Lol."
870875,phishfearme,2014-09-05 13:46:00,20,I can't see the pics for some reason.  But if it's the same Pickle Lake I am thinking of (a small town 10 hour north of T-Bay..??) Than I used to live there as a young child.  Not sure why I can't see your pics.  Great report man!  you're thinking of a different pickle lake - this lake is near wawa/white river  phish
870887,GRINGO LOCO,2014-09-05 14:58:00,20,"Gordy, it was our pleasure to meet you guys just before you flew out. Our flight in was scheduled for 8 AM but due to fog we flew at 2 PM with White River Air. On the flight back all our gear did not make it so we waited for the next plane and that's how we met you. When the next plane arrived there were no fishing rods and after two weeks we are still waiting for them. This was not White River Air that dropped the ball but the lodge which left them on our cabin porch and assured us that we would get them on the next plane out. The lodge advised that a trip just to return our rods was $500 so they would ship them the following week.  Our numbers on the walleyes were maybe a little better than yours and most of our fish were 15-18 inches. We didn't catch any walleyes over 20 inches as you did and our pike fishing was not good.  We would only catch one or two northerns per hour and they were small. Based on conversations with other fishermen in camp we were catching many more walleyes and fewer pike than they were. This I believe was due to the Lindy Rig and night crawlers when they were fishing jigs and minnows. Also we lucked on to a couple of hot spots unknown possibly to the camp.  I have been on 40-50 fly-ins and in my opinion the fishing is better in the Armstrong area but it is 350 miles further and more expensive. Considering that I might still go back as I generally go twice a year and I am retired"
