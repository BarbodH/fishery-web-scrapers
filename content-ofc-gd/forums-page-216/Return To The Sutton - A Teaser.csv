Been having great success with big streamers on specs and splake this spring and looking forward to finishing off the fall the same way.  Thanks for the tease, looking forward to the full report."

870394,Moosebunk,2014-09-02 01:55:00,3970,"No kidding eh? That must be quite the trek for them! Are they flying into Hawley?  Would take 8 to 12 hours Mike.  Earlier season (late Dec to mid Jan) before the bush snow was too deep and parts of the skeg ponds and creeks really slushed out.  Boys went across land mostly, using parts of the Skat, Ekwan and other creeks to make their way.  Couldn't always go every year as it often depended on the freeze and snow.  Do know that 160 were kept one three day tour, and many more put back."
870405,solopaddler,2014-09-02 02:53:00,8605,"Mike We stayed at PK Lodge on Granite Hill and fished both Buck Lake and Granite Hill. Buck lake was only ten minutes from PK. White River Air is only two miles out of White River and the flight was only 20 minutes. We easily could have caught many more walleyes(caught over 300, my partner counted his and caught 173).Nearly all our fish were caught in two hot locations, but we spent a lot of time scouting the lakes.(Buck Lake is advertised as three different Lakes with two lodges). Granite Hill looked like a nice facility from what I could see when I was there, glad you enjoyed the trip!  I think you're in the bush more than you're at home, crazy life you lead, very cool!  looking forward to the article and report  And I'm looking forward to our trip in mid September, should be fun.

Looking forward to the full article and loved the video, especially the transition to the underwater releases.  I have the Kelly Gallop Zoo Couger pattern, but that mouse pattern looks interesting. Do you have a link to the tying instructions?"

870431,blaque,2014-09-02 13:48:00,2419,Fantastic.......the video really lets ya step into the experience. (and i know it still probably doesnt do it justice) Closest ill probably ever get to this place though

Do you have a link to the tying instructions? The morrish is fairly easy to tie and floats like a cork. Tie in a tail of leather, followed by a tapered strip of black foam. Spin a body of deer and trim the belly short leaving the sides long. Cut a groove in the hair on top of the fly and pull the foam over the whole thing tying off at the eye, there should be about a half inch of foam extending past the eye."

870186,solopaddler,2014-08-31 20:21:00,8605,"I recently returned from another incredible trip to the Sutton River in Ontario's far north. You'll have to wait for the full story as it will be published in Ontario Out Of Doors early in the new year, but until then here's a short teaser!  It was a different trip this time as I didn't paddle the entire length of the river, instead staying at an outpost tent camp in the heart of the best fishing. Water was lower than the last time, but if anything the fishing was even more amazing as the fish were concentrated in the pools. Almost all the fish were caught swinging streamers or skating mouse patterns across the surface and it was pretty much non stop action with literally hundreds of fish caught!  I was able to spend a couple of days on Hawley Lake checking out the spectacular Sutton gorge and sampling the lake trout fishing in the lake itself. Although the lakers aren't huge, 4-8lb's on average, they're as thick as fleas and provided some icredible sport on light tackle.                                  I've put together a short video with some of the fly fishing highlights from the river, pretty awesome stuff have a look!        Hope you enjoyed the teaser,   Cheers,Â  Mike"

Real beauty. Will your partner in crime be able to add any?  Don't think my companion on this trip is even a member here Rob, so not likely. However I'm going to put together a detailed report that will be posted after the magazine article comes out. I have over 50GB's of video from this trip LOL!"
870191,Tomcat,2014-08-31 20:48:00,395,Great teaser Mike. Thanks for sharing. I'll keep any eye out for the full story in OOD.  Jay
870199,onthemountain,2014-08-31 21:21:00,9,Looks like paradise! Just incredible. I always love seeing these reports from you. Glad you had a great trip.

870208,solopaddler,2014-08-31 22:32:00,8605,"Glad you enjoyed the teaser guys!    Oh my god, I need to experience that system for myself someday. Were you able to take some lakers on the fly?  Hawley is an interesting lake, it's nothing more than a deep featureless crevice with almost no structure. I'm positive you could get lakers on the fly earlier in the season, but the fish were too deep last week. We were jigging for them in 50-90' of water, 20lb braid with a stiff spinning rod and 1oz jigs. Almost every single time the jig hit the bottom you'd lift up and have a heavy hit. It actually got boring. The lake trout fishing is so good that a trip to Hawley just to fish for them alone is totally worth it."

What you described for numbers and size is dead on with what they do too.  Hordes of five pounders kept to be smoked later.  Will make for an interesting read in OOD.

I found a fishing partner and caught plenty of walleyes (over 300) once we figured out to forget jigs and minnows and fish Lindy Rigs with crawlers.
