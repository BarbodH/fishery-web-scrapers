I've never seen a muskie fingerling, so I don't know how vivid the colours are. Looks like it had experienced a run-in with something that thought it was food.  "
871199,northernpike56,2014-09-07 20:19:00,717,Baby pike. They tend to have different variations in markings depending on where they live
871202,Spiel,2014-09-07 20:28:00,9065,"Baby pike. They tend to have different variations in markings depending on where they live  Agreed, young northern pike that clearly had a run in with some type of predator."
871204,Roy,2014-09-07 20:37:00,13728,Juvie pike for sure.
871242,Gallie,2014-09-07 23:57:00,1215,How long would you say it was? I have never seen a pike over 6 in with markings like that. I agree it looks like a pike with the light on dark markings but it does look a little strange.
871319,Dave Bailey,2014-09-08 15:02:00,1641,"I'm guessing about 6"" - 8"". I've caught a smaller pike than that, and it didn't have stripes, just the regular spots."

871330,ehg,2014-09-08 15:44:00,2666,Ya its a small pike. Have caught 10-12 inch musky while bass fishing. The juv. musky were silvery with similar barring of dark greenish colouring.
871340,jbailey,2014-09-08 16:57:00,866,you guys sure its not a grass pickerel?
