871266,beenfishing,2014-09-08 01:52:00,21,I went to Carlisle today to try some trout fishing on Bronte Creek. Went to Progreston Falls but didn't have much luck. I don't usually fish for trout but I tried using some split shots and floating Gulp eggs. (with spinning real & rod)  Any other good spots on the Bronte in that area? Where is the Loweville Dam? I heard that may be a good spot.  Cheers
871268,bushart,2014-09-08 01:57:00,2628,I'll help ya here bud  Carlisle is not Bronte Creek  Loweville is in Loweville---up Guelph Line--north of Burlington----not sure about access anymore----many meatheads later--has shut down many access fishing spots along that creek  Credit may have some spots yet  I have'nt tripped that area for some years now
871273,beenfishing,2014-09-08 02:34:00,21,Thanks All Knowing.   I thought Bronte Creek went through Loweville and Carlisle?  I'd like to try some spots on the credit.
871279,solopaddler,2014-09-08 02:58:00,8605,"  Carlisle is not Bronte Creek    Yes it is.  I grew up there.It was great trout fishing back then, not sure about now. It's quite a while since I've fished it.  And fwiw it's Lowville if you're looking for it on a map. And yes Bronte flows through both Carlisle and Lowville. There is access although the better stretches are private. If you knock on a door and ask you'll most likely get permission though."
871298,bushart,2014-09-08 12:30:00,2628,Yeah I see it's part of Bronte  I guess for years we just referred to it as Carlisle Creek---think that's what the locals called it back then
