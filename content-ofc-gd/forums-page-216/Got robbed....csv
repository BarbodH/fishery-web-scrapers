870643,DRIFTER_016,2014-09-04 03:09:00,10439,I caught a guy stealing my stuff. The body was never found!!!!!
870670,DanD,2014-09-04 12:21:00,2223,"Went to leave for work this morning and noticed the interior light was on in the wife's Envoy. Yup the driver's door window frame was pulled/bent out and they were likely able to reach in and hit the power lock switch. We never keep anything of value in our vehicles but the Envoy was ransacked with maybe a few CDs missing and a couple bucks worth of change. Our neighborhood seems to go through a monthly cycle, where we all get hit once or twice on our street with some form of break in. It usually happens shortly after a new family moves into the subsidized rental townhouses at the end of out street. It only took 4 days this time since the moving trucks left and all the new tenants moved in.  Dan."

We never keep anything of value in our vehicles but the Envoy was ransacked with maybe a few CDs missing and a couple bucks worth of change. This is one of the things that drives me crazy the most.  Thugs cause thousands of dollars in damage (at least a $500 deductable for DanD) all to steal $10.   Makes you want to just sit out in a lawn chair and hand out $10 bills to all the scumbags who wander by.  Probably a lot cheaper.  It reminds me of an article I read in the newspaper several years ago about a thief who stole some coper or brass fittings from some equipment on a property containing hazardous materials.  The alloys were worth maybe a hundred bucks but the clean up cost the property owner over half a million and not covered by insurance.  How crazy is that?
871064,Mike the Pike,2014-09-06 16:48:00,3421,I don't like to hear this....you work hard for your toys and some low life takes your fishing gear.....I hope the skum bag gets caught one day
871069,Shloim,2014-09-06 18:10:00,515,Better you didn't catch them. I heard of a guy that tried to surprise a burglar and wound up getting the crap beaten out of himself over a crappy bicycle from his garage. Cheaper to replace said items and hope the karma police catch up with them. They often do....
871073,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-06 20:17:00,8243,"The sad reality is that a petty theft charge is nothing to these crack head low lifes. I was born, bred and worked in Hamilton until we moved to the cottage in 2000. These vacation places were and still are targets because they are isolated and the owners didn't even know they were broken into for months sometimes. They used to target the odd beer and bottle of hooch now it's high end electronics and land and water toys from these ""cottages"". It has gotten better but I have seen and heard of as many thefts rurally than when I lived right in downtown Hamilton. Low life's care nothing about geography, opportunity is all they care about, and their next puff of stupid stick or crack. Many lucrative thefts out this way are for the crops that are coming soon and we aren't talking about cow corn. They go to great lengths to raid the grow ops. Night vision goggle that show a heat signature for mature buds, GPS, even renting airplanes to do fly overs looking for patches mimicking law enforcement agencies that do the same exact thing to pinpoint a grow op. These aren't your petty theft lowlifes, these are big time organized crime low life thieves.  I am a member of a social club on James St. N. in Hamilton. We get these cracked out lowlifes coming in everyday with bag loads of swag to sell. The easiest score lately is Beef from grocery stores, bag loads. As son as we call the police on these guys they catch on and high tail it out of the place. The police tell us they can lock them up everyday only to see them on the streets the very next day doing the very same thing.  At least they are stealing from Fortino's rather than breaking into residences for trinkets. Just because they are thieves and druggies doesn't mean they are stupid. They bring in a large grocery bag and fill it and walk out. If I had a choice of where they steal I vote for the corporate retailers rather than a helpless Senior in the neighborhood."
871074,fishing n autograph,2014-09-06 20:42:00,2540,"Sucks I've had my car broken in to as well, they didn't get anything thought.  These punks get caught and charged and they are out in days or weeks. No lesson learned.  FYI you were a victim of theft not robbery. Robbery is theft with violence."
871078,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-06 21:49:00,8243,"I'll tell you how bad it can be, this past spring a bicycle cop had his ride stolen from a parking meter when she and another constable sat inside the restaurant and had lunch. \they were never nabbed. I guess they don't lock them if they need to ride at a moments notice. Try and explain that one to the Sarg. at shifts end."
870220,mike rousseau,2014-09-01 00:26:00,4661,Who steals a net... Portable charger... And a boat seat with pedistal...???  In my driveway while we were home sleeping...  Unreal what low life's will risk jail time for...  The stuff is pretty old and worthless but to replace everything it will cost me over $300...  I hope someday I catch one of these punks in the act...
870229,spincast,2014-09-01 00:46:00,3279,"that sucks Mike. About 10 years ago when I first started to get back into fishing someone hit the truck the one night I left the rods and tackle in after a long hot day of fishing.  Lost about the same amount.  Replaced the locks on the cap. Unfortunately doesn't matter where you live, ya gotta lock it up."
870230,Fisherpete,2014-09-01 00:48:00,1814,"Brutal bud, sorry to hear"
870231,SuperDave,2014-09-01 00:52:00,204,Yup been there myself. 2 years ago while I was out fishing some jerkwad broke my truck  window and made off with lots of goodies even my boots! Lowest form of life.
870234,mike rousseau,2014-09-01 00:58:00,4661,I get locking stuff up... But really.... A boat seat?
870237,limeyangler,2014-09-01 01:29:00,5204,Unreal what low life's will risk jail time for...    LOL….JAIL TIME????? you don't even get jail for armed robbery these days.   My sympathies to you Mike….that makes my blood boil.
870239,mike rousseau,2014-09-01 01:48:00,4661,And a week after having Pete and Andrew out for the day I donated to fishing for Tyler...  Come on karma... What the heck?
870240,John Bacon,2014-09-01 02:46:00,3277,I get locking stuff up... But really.... A boat seat?  With the price of boat seats that does not surprise me too much.  Especially if it is the original boat brand.
870244,mike rousseau,2014-09-01 03:12:00,4661,It was a 16 year old casting seat on a broken pedistal... Lmao  Aftermarket...
870245,Gerritt,2014-09-01 04:07:00,6129,Keep an eye on kijiji.... You never know  G
870246,fishindevil,2014-09-01 07:10:00,6254,That sucks mike !!! It's bull and I have been there before as well just lowlifes !!! Keep an eye on kijiji like gerrit said and hope for the best
870255,Gregoire,2014-09-01 12:24:00,1397,I'm sorry to hear that.
870256,davey buoy,2014-09-01 12:35:00,5505,"That sucks Mike,I added 650 watts of light to my driveway with a motion sensor.Lights up my driveway and neighbours like a landing strip lol .He added the camera.That's all we can do.Can't stay up 24/7.Sure would be nice if you can find the stuff.As said,keep a eye out."
870259,Ralph Field,2014-09-01 12:57:00,1018,Remember some steal just to steal. They likely threw your stuff into a ditch down the road.
870260,lew,2014-09-01 13:01:00,12766,Thieves are the skum of the earth.
870261,outllaw,2014-09-01 13:09:00,1232,sucks. I have a security lite front/back. plus a dog... normally its dopers trying to get valuables from vehicles. I hope that pedestal seat collapses and the thieve gets the shaft
870264,Walleye72,2014-09-01 13:38:00,156,"That sucks big time !!!  I'll tell you what though, after reading all these stories about theft from boats and such, when getting ready for holidays this summer I left the boat in my garage over night, and hooked it all up in the morning.  I just couldn't take the risk of leaving it in the driveway even with the cover cinched down tight.   I have my eye out for a light and a camera that feeds to my PC which is almost always on."
870265,mike rousseau,2014-09-01 13:50:00,4661,My next house will have a garage... A well secured garage...
870274,lew,2014-09-01 14:25:00,12766,"My next house will have a garage... A well secured garage...  I've got a big 1000 sq. ft. garage plus a 400 sq. ft. loft above it and park my boat & truck in there plus all my tools and everything else.  Being out in the country I never bothered to lock the place as there had never been a report of anything ever been stolen on this road before until a neighbor down the road had his ATV stolen last year.  I now keep the garage locked every night and leave an outside light on.  Sad that we have to live this way but until our courts ever decide that these punks need to be dealt with SEVERELY, we don't have much of a choice I spose."
870277,4x4bassin,2014-09-01 14:33:00,1025,"That's brutal , I hate hearing about things like this"
870369,Lunatic,2014-09-02 00:43:00,536,i have friends who laugh and call me paranoid. i always take my gear out of the boat with me even if its only for 30min while i eat. it sucks lugging everything 3 times a day up and down to the boat but i still have it all. living in hamilton makes anyone paranoid about thieves!  but a boat seat........thats interesting.
870379,AdamS,2014-09-02 01:20:00,161,Yikes! I have my boat uncovered outside right now..I emptied it out but my seats are still pretty new so I'm puttin the cover on her tonight. Where are you from mike?
870391,ketchenany,2014-09-02 01:48:00,3229," Lew , when we go to work (well not you ) other people also go to ""work""  and help themselves! I'm like you they are scum and then some. I've only had my car looked at and they too my change. Where I live now we should be leaving our wallets in the driveway! But it will never happen, a few people down the road think we are easy pickings  and when they need it they will come."
870595,creditmaster,2014-09-03 21:22:00,190,that sucks man i onece han my 600 dollar waders stolen right out of my locked garage
870610,Fisherpete,2014-09-03 22:36:00,1814,"As annoying as it is, I do the same - empty everything out of the boat every time. Years ago I stopped for lunch once for an hour at a friend's cottage and thieves took all the rods, tackle and even the worm box and anchor! Ridiculous. At night if I leave the boat at the dock, the boat gets cable locked to the dock, and a second cable runs thru both my seats and the gas can onto the first lock... if someone wants it that bad they will still cut the locks and get it, but it will take some effort."
