871880,skinny,2014-09-11 02:19:00,442,just purchased a pair of used rhino trolling combos. when I got home I realized one is missing the little clutch lever and screw. I have contacted Zebco and another place think it was mikes reel repair. total for the parts was like 2.00 or less and shipping like 30.00 there has to be a better way  rhino RBCXL2 50 Clutch Lever Screw EI053-01 53 Clutch Lever GI142-01   so looking for options  
871923,NANUK,2014-09-11 11:51:00,797,"$30 for shipping such small parts is outrageous, those reels didn't cost much more than new. Have you tried Aikman in Mississauga ? He used to be Zebco / Quantum authorized service centre, I don't know if still is ."
