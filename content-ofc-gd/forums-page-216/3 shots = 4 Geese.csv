I'm not being a wise ass I just don't hear any gunshots here along the lake until fall and then it sounds like a Saturday night in Bagdad. If it is open please come to my place E, they keep us awake at night, do they ever sleep?  edit, Just answered my own question, Google is good. You must be waaaay up north sir, but still feel free to hammer them down here when it is open. There has to be a herd of 100 out back right now."

Limit in most areas is 10 per day per person for 10 days.  If you have property where they are feeding, you will have no problem finding people to come help ya out.  Just wish I wasn't 2 hrs away from you."

It was kind of a fishing/goose scouting trip. Glad ya got a few. We ended up with a 23"" walleye, and 33"" musky. Lost 2 other fish too. Just trolling musky.  S."
