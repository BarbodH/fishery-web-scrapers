Anyways I'm stopping in at sail this Saturday to pick up a little terminal tackle but wanted to pick up a pair of decent waterproof pants or overall style pants. I'm looking at a budget of about 100-120 bucks. I mostly will be using them as a spring and fall pant. Your suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks for your input."

Waterproof,breathable,not to heavy and durable,plus velcro cuffs on ankles and large pockets.  On a side note if you know anyone that works for Canada Post,they issue some nice gortex pants to the letter carriers and alot of them don't  even bother wearing them."

While they're not gortex or anything fancy, I've stayed dry on numerous fishing and canoeing trips.  They don't breathe but have zippered vents the entire length of both legs that manage to keep moisture from building up on the inside. If I have any issue with them it's that wearing only boxers under them can be chilly. Bill"

Their Dry Wear Tourney Trail series is an exceptional product(s) and priced reasonably."
