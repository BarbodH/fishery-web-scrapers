I've been told the old adage that wind from the West, catches the Best, wind from the East catches the Least.

863464,Terry,2014-07-17 00:56:00,14456,"Maybe the wind, barometer and moon phases all  really do make a difference and I do check them just before or at the start of a storm can be the best fishing ever  but I work and have a life so I can not pick and choose to go fishing when all the signs add up..so I go when I can go and I check on when the best fishing is and if there is a best time during the time I am on the water I try to be in the best spot in the area I am fishing at that time  but other then that I just fish when I can"

So here's the challenge: Heading to the home lake tomorrow (Thursday) and will be available to fish from 5:00 Thursday pm through Sunday 9:00 am. Prognostications based on BP, moon phase or solnar tables would be appreciated. I will do my best to fish these times (based on consensus) and report back accordingly. Winner gets bragging rights"
863550,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-17 15:27:00,29,"Lol, great plan - Moon phase can be planned ahead, I'll look into that later today. BP has to be taken real-time because you can't predict that in advance for a weekend. Same with wind."

863287,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-15 22:43:00,29,"I'm a believer in the barometric pressure trends theory of fishing - at least for smallies. I'm a programmer by day, and made an app to measure the trends that I've been using all summer.I decided to share it, so it's on GooglePlay (Apple devices don't have barometers) for anyone interested.Needs an Android phone that has a Barometric Pressure Sensor in it.  I have tried fishing by moon phases, wind speed and water temp, and barometric pressure for me seems to work pretty good. But I mostly fish smallmouth between Ottawa and Peterborough.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.garret.fishingbarometer"

They're under water, where I assume the above-water changes are either impossible or near impossible to detect (or not, apparently)."
863323,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-16 01:21:00,29,"I can't say I've ever heard anyone call a steady barometric pressure good fishing conditions - usually you want it to be moving, slowly or quickly, down or preferably up.

Also, they usually ""standardize"" pressure readings to sea-level so that we can get an idea of overall trends, making up for differences in altitude. That's why they always report ~101 kPa, give or take a few, even when raw data might be 80. I have to maybe watch the moon schedule more closely if the monster fish are being caught along it, that would be an interesting study.

As for the moon phases, I don't wait for a full moon to go fishing, but I find it does definitely improve the fishing when it does happen.  Couple years back I was on my annual trip to the West Arm of Nippissing with a full moon forecast in the coming days, and one day in particular had the full moon rising at the exact time as the sun was setting and I planned to be on a favorite spot when it happened.  Couple days before the event and shortly before sunset I caught this fish.    Day before the event and again near sunset I got this one.

863368,Sinker,2014-07-16 13:29:00,8692,"The moon controls a lot more than most people realize. Migrations, seasons, tides...it is a powerful rock in the sky. I know for sure it effects fishing, and it never lies. Now, that said, if you have crap weather on a good moon, the fishing will be impacted by the weather for sure, but fishing and hunting the moon phases will certainly increase your odds.  Same thing with the barometer. Get one and keep it in your house and check it when you go fishing. It doesn't take long to figure out that a rising barometer makes the fish bite.....why?? I have no idea, but its a fact. I have a borometer, and I ALWAYS follow the moon phase. Its a fact that they improve fishing when you get the right barometer with the right moon.....but like everyone else, I can't plan my fishing days accordingly, so I just fish when I can.  If anyone is into waterfowl.....watch the full moons in the fall. Migratory birds will fly all night long on a north wind with a big moon. Your almost guaranteed a great hunt on a full moon.  There is a lot more to it than I can type here, but the moon and barometer heavily impact a lot of things in nature.....in fact, most things.  S."

Let me tell you - the fishing was hot hot hot.  At one point I had 10 straight casts where I caught something.  The next day the phase was low - and I was back in the same spot......and pretty much caught nothing the whole day.  Same lures, same spots, roughly same time of day.  No weather changes, temperature about the same, cloud layer about the same.  Anyway - I follow the charts now.  Consider it part of my fishing toolkit.  Of course there are other things that will have impacts - like a cold front, etc.  But if I see a phase that says excellent fishing -> I am wayyyyy more motivated to go out."
863400,AKRISONER,2014-07-16 17:59:00,5558,"I dont necessarily know about the moon etc, but I think anyone here who says they dont notice a difference in fishing dependent on the weather is crazy. Barometric pressure relates entirely to what kind of weather we are experiencing and I find any time that there is a big drop, the fish are on. This is most likely due to the fact that when it rains, food is flooded into the lake and the fish feed, hence if you fish prior to the rain the fish are active and ready to feed but the food they are waiting for isnt available yet.  I fish a lot and I honestly do not think there is any denying that the majority of times when the fish are biting hard is prior to a storm system. This past weekend if fished buck horn and the bite was on hard all day albeit the very ...of course a storm blew in Sunday morning."
