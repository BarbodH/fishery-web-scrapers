Lots of tick tick tick but very little hook ups. Bottom  2 ft of the screen is thick. All small,hell, tiny stuff. There are some signs of shiners showing up,but nothing in the numbers of years past again. No gulls,no terns to be seen either. That,s a big clue to how far behind this season is.  This time last year,I was ducking away from diving terns.    Covered 14 fow out to 48 fow in the bay here this morning. 7am-11am.  Still seeing small ducklings swimming with their mothers. They will not survive sad to say. What a screwed up season this has been.     "
871185,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-07 19:17:00,8243,"Couldn't agree more about a screwed up season. The spring and summer that never was.  The Walleye fishery here on Erie has been stellar this year, on fire, best numbers and sizes since 93', coincidently 92' was the last bad winter here. But where are the Perch? All the regular hot spots here did produce a few times but here today gone tomorrow. The Perch normally feed on these spots spring to winter. The only spot that produced Perch daily, and still is, is off of the west side of Hastings Road west of Long Point. It's no big secret and very tough to get to. The closest launch is an 18 KM run Burwell to Hastings, it may be 18 miles. Dig Dave, a charter guy there limited nearly every outing. I think he hit 13,000 or 14,000 fish last week. Yes thousand, not hundreds!!"
871186,Fisherman,2014-09-07 19:17:00,7201,"Yep, watched 4 hens with 14 chicks this morning, roughly the size of cornish game hens.  I don't hold much hope for them either unfortunately.  Now if they were to come by the office we would gladly feed them to help out."
871188,misfish,2014-09-07 19:28:00,29133,"Erich.  We had a hatch of 15 at work. Last count was 6. Yotes Im sure got them. Like said,way to small to make it through the winter."
871220,ckrb2007,2014-09-07 22:06:00,449,I've been seeing a lot of really young loons in the Kawarthas this year also. Doubt they will make it.
871280,Paudash,2014-09-08 03:04:00,273,"funny you say that about loons, I have seen more this year then ever by far"
871283,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-08 05:35:00,8243,"Yes many birds out there, where are the perch though? Inside the birds?"
871302,steelhedrmatt,2014-09-08 12:59:00,278,"Brian.  I had no problem finding them yesterday.  All jumbos. Nothing under 10"".  If you want to get out, PM me."
871324,misfish,2014-09-08 15:30:00,29133,"We know where some are as well. ;)12"",ers and some even  nearing  14 inchers.  Their just  not where they usually are this time of year in the bottom end of the bay."
