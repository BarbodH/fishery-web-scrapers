871714,sneak_e_pete,2014-09-10 14:26:00,540,Didnt want to hijack the other thread.  I was up on the French (Wolseley Bay) last week for the week.  Fishing was tough.  I picked up about 10 eyes for the week and all were caught with bottom bouncers and worm harness in about 40 ft of water.  So the question:  I marked a TON of fish suspended at around 40-50 ft in the 60-80ft depth range.  Would a dipsy be a good thing to try?  Is there a good tutorial article or video on how to use them?  I run braid.  Thanks in advance!
