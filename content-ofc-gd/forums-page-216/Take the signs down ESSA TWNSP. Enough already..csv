871060,kickingfrog,2014-09-06 15:54:00,8333,I questioned the legality of the fee when it was first announced. They township said they could charge me while I was in my canoe using a navigable waterway. I told them were they could put their fee and haven't fished or hunted there since. They'll never miss me but some of the businesses might and that's too bad. I've moved on.
871063,Musky or Specks,2014-09-06 16:43:00,2710,"God knows I'm no lawyer but clearly the Heritage Hunting and Fishing Act of 2002 states  Right to hunt and fish 1.  (1)  A person has a right to hunt and fish in accordance with the law. 2002, c. 10, s. 1 (1). Same (2)  The reference to the law in subsection (1) includes the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997, the Fisheries Act (Canada), the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 (Canada) and the regulations made under those Acts. 2002, c. 10, s. 1 (2).  Essa Township enforces the fee under land use and not any fisheries law because they do not have juristiction. We are constantly bullied by big government and others because no one can afford the legal fees to sue or cease and desist.  It's clearly a law that  discriminates against fisherman and therefore shouldn't stand up in court.  Of coarse no one will ever fight it because the legal fees would just be too much."
871071,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-06 18:23:00,8243,"We have all sorts of rights and freedoms that is law. No one said that right doesn't come with a service fee. We have the right to drive on all public roadways regardless if we have paid personal income taxes or not, that right comes with a myriad of user fees from drivers license's to disposal of old tires.  If those signs didn't exist how would John Q. Public know there is a user fee to rent the park to go along with his Fishing license to allow him to take advantage of his government given right to fish."
871081,kickingfrog,2014-09-06 22:39:00,8333,This is more along the lines of me charging cars a fee for driving on the road in front of my house and no one doing anything about it. I don't own the road and Essa doesn't own the river.

871515,DanD,2014-09-09 12:21:00,2223,"Back in the mid 70's, we lived on a tobacco farm, that backed onto the Thames River. My Dad had bulldozed a ram to the water's edge for the irrigation pump; which also doubled as a boat launch for a lot of the locals. After it got known that my dad allowed people to use it as such; the garbage came with it. So Dad took the dozer down to the access road that lead to the flats and piled the 5 foot mound of dirt on it. People could still walk in; the garbage left behind was less; but eventually the flats were all fenced off and no trespassing signs went up. Dad didn't like too do it, it cost him a chunk of money; but it was the only way to stop people from throwing their junk on the property and sorry to say but most of it came from the fishermen.  Dan."

In regards to hunting , there is a STRONG movement to have all hunting completely banned from Certain Simcoe forest tracts. Residents are tired of forests turning into weekend shooting ranges and the garbage and Bull that goes along with it. I walk/train my retriever in these forest tracts daily and you would not believe some of the crap you see . I've made it a priority to sit in at some council meetings this fall as hunting/fishing is an extremely important Tradition I hope my children inherit . Also with this being an election year, I will be sure to bring it up with the next candidate that visits our house in Thornton .  Ryan"

You now have Big city thinking and all it's micro-managing job justification goin down...3 legged dogs must only be walked on tuesdays on the left side of the path  I'm sure any dollar amt will keep the destroyers out---but You do make a point---why single out anglers?  Maybe history has not shown our group to be the neatest  I recall Trout opener in the Meaford/Thornbury corridor in the 70's---creeks and rivers were a mess----I remember at Bronte one year----somebody lighting a 50ft pine tree on fire---the whole tree---quite a sight----broken fences.....fistfights----picinic tables thrown into the water...etc etc  At the end of the day---we know we are responsible for our river footprint-------many still don't care---and you are paying for them.

There was garbage thrown everywhere, coffee cups, donut bags, pop cans, beer bottles and just about any other crap you can think of. It didn't stop in the parking lot either cause the same garbage was scattered all around the ice huts.  Why the owners of the orange building allowed the pigs to park there is beyond me, but if I had any control of things up that way I'd be blocking everyone I could."

As for contacting them,that is going to be happening soon,as I have another matter which Im trying to get clarified.   Lew I know exactly where your talking about.

871036,crappieperchhunter,2014-09-06 13:22:00,2582,In the 30 years I have fished Lake Simcoe I have seen many shore fishing and lake access spots ruined for everyone by fishermen who are disrespectful pigs. Seems ESSA is trying to discourage the same problems in there  area. I think they have come to the conclusion that most of the problem is caused by fishermen...and I bet they are 100% correct... so they are targeting that specific group. I really have no problem with that. Believe me Brian I understand the frustration of being singled out because of other disrespectful pigs...but it is what it is. Why charge everyone if one specific group is the major cause of the problem?  Many of my old spots on Simcoe are pay access now. I don't fish them anymore unless someone else suggests we meet there. I can afford to pay for parking/access but generally refuse to on principal.  Every individual has to decide on there own if the fees are worth it to them or not. Many will chose to pay it and be happy with what they get for there $40. Others will flip the bird to ESSA and fish elsewhere.

Many of the boat launches, if you can call them that, are subject to a $6 fee for launching and parking for the day. Now I usually don't mind paying a bit to launch, but the launches aren't private property, we already pay our taxes, so I'm not paying again to launch at these locations, Canal and Mitchell Lake have these signs. They don't do anything with the money to improve the launches, they're just simple, poor gravel ones and parking lots full of potholes, it's just another hand in our pocket."

I personally don't.
