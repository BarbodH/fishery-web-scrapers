870905,davey buoy,2014-09-05 17:48:00,5505,"the starting bid is 75. think i'll just pass.  thanks If it holds air,why not go $100?Still less than half of a new one.Tax on the new one,how about auction?"
870937,misfish,2014-09-05 21:17:00,29133,"     $75 is way to much in the first place. What a piece of crap.   I,ll be upgrading next spring and putting mine up for sale once the hard water comes.  I,ll keep you in mind.  Just plain jane.    And the add on,s are endless.  "
