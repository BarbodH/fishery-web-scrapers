Would go 1 size up to be able to layer. Any other thoughts. Budget would be around $400 for the set  A jigging combo. Leaning towards the st croix eye con 6'3 medium light, extra fast Would pair with a shimano symetre 2500 series (although I have read that many prefer a 1000 size for jigging but I'm not sure why) or the same size in a pflueger supreme xt.  Budget would be under $300 for the combo  Feedback appreciated Gordy"
871162,RickOnt,2014-09-07 14:09:00,669,"Hi Gordy  I have the BPS pro Qualifier It is a fantastic suit keeps me dry on the wet days and warm on the cool days,  Watch the BPS sales flyers and you should get it for $400  Most of my jigging rods are St Croix Med or Med light.  I use the 1000. With braid there is no need for the larger 2500 spool  The 1000 is lighter not a big deal for a couple hours but if it is in your hand every day for a 7 day trip it is nice.  Just my   $.02  Lots of options out there  Cheers Rick"
871163,gordy28,2014-09-07 14:27:00,638,Thanks Rick Great input and I hadn't thought about the weight and redundancy of the bigger spool w braid Do you have a preferred st croix model?
871177,RickOnt,2014-09-07 17:21:00,669,"Premier or Avid  But the first, go to set up, I reach for, is a 6'6"" Premier Med/Light and a Symmetre 1000 spooled with 5 lb power pro  If I am fishing the north where the water is tea stained the PP is tied directly to the Jig  Like I said my 2 cents lots of options"
871244,FloatnFly,2014-09-08 00:12:00,1640,"i like my shimano crucial worm and jig rod, its only 5.5ft long and 2 piece, so its light weight, with strong back bone, i put a smaller gander mountain reel on it, holds about 150yrds of 15lb braid"
871245,porkpie,2014-09-08 00:25:00,2521,"I have been using the eyecons with the 1000 series stradic's.  Very nice combos, and very light and responsive.  I too find the 1000 series reels to be plenty for just about every pickerel application I run into.  To be truthfull, I've landed several muskies on the eyecon/1000 combo as well, most in the 35-40 inch class, and have had no issues (I've also been bit clean off a few times too LOL).  Countless bass as well.  I run braid with an 8-10lb lead of seaguar.  They are a good rod, and the 1000 reel will do just about all you need it too, unless your into tuna fishing!  I've had pro qualifier bibs for about 8 years and they've been great.  Just bought a BPS goretex jacket a month ago as my old jacket finally gave up.  I guess I'll find out if the quality is still there!"
