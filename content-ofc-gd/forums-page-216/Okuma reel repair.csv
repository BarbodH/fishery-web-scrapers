871648,Happy Hooker,2014-09-10 00:42:00,9,"Hi all,  Wondering if someone can point me in the right direction, I have an Okuma Convector that is in need of repair and I am hoping to find a repair shop in the GTA. I understand Rocky's in Orillia is an authorized repair center but I don't really get out that way. Anyone or place in the GTA that can do the repair?  Thanks, Steve"
871649,Steve,2014-09-10 00:47:00,2075,"okuma's generally can be returned, without receipt, for a new one.  especially their great lakes reels."
871656,NANUK,2014-09-10 01:38:00,797,How old is the reel and what do you think is wrong with it ?
871695,Fisherpete,2014-09-10 10:38:00,1814,Aikmans in Mississauga 3010 Novar Road (905) 277-3595
871863,Happy Hooker,2014-09-11 01:02:00,9,"Reel is roughly 5 years old, don't know what part(s) have broken but when I reel in the line does not pick up consistently. It will reel in a foot or so then nothing for a few handle turns then in again - seems like the worm gear (?) is worn. It a converctor 30D.  Tried Aikmans a while back but was told they don't service Okuma's.  Thanks for the help so far guys.  Steve"
871876,Steve,2014-09-11 02:01:00,2075,sounds like a typical okuma  i'd just return it to a local shop that sells okuma.  i'm quite sure they'll replace it.  okuma warranty and the way they take of their customers are likely the best in the business. shimano should take note.
