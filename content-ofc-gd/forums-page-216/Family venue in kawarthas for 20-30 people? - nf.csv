Mostly interested in Stony/Pigeon/Lower Buckhorn lake areas but open to others. Must have a spot to have a boat at the dock.  We've already checked out viamede and westwood resorts so looking for some more resort type suggestions; and also open to a large cottage setup in those areas to have the venue.  Let me know if you have any suggestions or feel free to pm.  Thanks again"

871838,lew,2014-09-10 23:00:00,12766,Burliegh Island Lodge may have what your interested in.  Their at the west end of Stoney and have plenty of docking and a good ramp. There's a motel unit plus a few cabins and the whole place is pretty darned nice.  I live just down the road from there and although we have dinner there on a regular basis I've never rented their cabins so can't honestly give an opinion on them.  Might be worth looking into.  https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.burleighislandgrill.com%2Fburleigh-island-lodge.html&ei=2NYQVMDPLsSoyATmloGYBg&usg=AFQjCNF3WbSG0wnHEd39qAJ3f96acuz7Lg
871845,adempsey,2014-09-10 23:58:00,1498,"We used to go to Elmhirst Resort on Rice Lake every year when I was younger.   Nice place.   Has a pub, a restaurant and a wine tasting room.  Also indoor and outdoor pools, a game room.  Somewhat pricey, but the cottages are really nice and it's really not that expensive if you look at places in the Muskokas.   Even the least expensive cottages are nicer than most cottages I've stayed at.   I haven't been in a couple years though."
871851,Pigeontroller,2014-09-11 00:22:00,2793,Pine Vista on Stony is nice.

871858,GBW,2014-09-11 00:50:00,8460,I have never been but I see great updates and info from the following via facebook.  Curtis Point Cottages a family and fishing resort.  I have seen pic's posted there from a few members here too.  Worth a look and or call
871901,pidge,2014-09-11 04:56:00,438,Good advice from Lew given about Burleigh Island Lodge. Have stayed in the Motel Cottages twice this summer. Nice and clean only drawback for some is they don't supply a stove. Only a BBQ for cooking. Great place though.
871930,Steve,2014-09-11 13:05:00,2075,My wife and I stayed at Burleigh Island Lodge a number of years back.  Beautiful place with great food!
