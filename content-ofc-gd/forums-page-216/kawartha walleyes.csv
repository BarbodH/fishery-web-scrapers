870951,ecmilley,2014-09-05 23:06:00,2163,"Last Sunday Geoff (GBW) and myself decided to to a little fishing, no real plan just launced the boat with assorted bass and eye stiks and went fishing, as it turned out the walleye were on the chew with water temps at 66 in the morning and warming through out the day put a plan in action for walleyes and was quickly rewarded with a couple keepers in 17ft of water workin underwater rockpiles with grubs, put the lowrancestructure scan to good use determining areas to target and was pretty much non stop till 4pm when we were worn out every spot I stopped at that day got us at least 2 fish several massive walleyes made it to boatside before biting us off (and i have there address) great day out on the water good company and 7 nice keeper wallys for dinner. typical fish that day."
870956,Joeytier,2014-09-05 23:35:00,3990,"That's awesome.  September can be absolutely lights out for walleye, and sometimes a complete bust!!"
870958,msp,2014-09-05 23:39:00,1336,Nice. I could use a day like that well done
870987,Walleye'm Fishing,2014-09-06 01:04:00,310,"Wow, fantastic day for ya, congrats!"
870990,captpierre,2014-09-06 01:19:00,2521,beats the snot out of what I've managed on Pigeon
870992,GBW,2014-09-06 01:25:00,8460,We had a boat load off fun so thanks again 'E'!  and out of the 7 keepers that we decided were the best of the bunch to keep in the 35-50cm slot they were all nice and healthy.  Others caught in the slot but still sent back.  and there were a bunch of others caught too.  the bass had it easy last weekend.  lol
870993,GBW,2014-09-06 01:27:00,8460,"PS, only bass liked the carrot stick's offering, lol! edit to add pic. "

870997,Big Cliff,2014-09-06 01:47:00,6899,Nice going ! I did get out for a couple of hours but the walleye weren't in the spots I'd normally find this time of the year.
870998,GBW,2014-09-06 01:53:00,8460,"Cheers Chris, few and FAAAAR between now on my posts."

871003,Sinker,2014-09-06 02:08:00,8692,"Nice work boys! The eyes havent really stopped since opener. I think ive caught more this year than ever, and yeah, good size to them too!  S."
871006,chris.brock,2014-09-06 02:17:00,4053,"Sinker, so now you're saying they are on fire indefinitely, wow, no pictures, it didn't happen (smiley face!)  any tips appreciated  the good size may be reflective of the slot restrictions showing effect?"

871022,Big Cliff,2014-09-06 09:42:00,6899,no weed edges there Cliff? Lots of weed edges LOL and I am getting some walleye but many are small ones (under the slot). It is good to see but the bigger girls have eluded me so far this fall.
871123,Meely,2014-09-07 02:37:00,282,Bucktser and I were out on Pigeon Lake all 3 days of the Labour Day weekend and did VERY well ....... (well....Buckster caught most of them).  I cant remember the last time we caught that many.  They were all sizes and caught numerous in the legal size range. Each and every one went back!  Looks like the lower limit of 4 may be working!  Meely
871230,buckster,2014-09-07 23:03:00,530,Best part about the weekend was the fact that there was not another boat in sight.   Well other than the odd water skier or jet ski.
