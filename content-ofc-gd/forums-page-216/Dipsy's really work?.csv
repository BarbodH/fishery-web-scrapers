871501,davey buoy,2014-09-09 10:16:00,5505,"We have spent hours with a *0 and a 1 Changed up the lures.Between the two we are running 40 to almost 60. The fish are in that area 85% of the time last couple days.Maybe the bite is off,maybe something were doing?.We change speeds,do turns.Not sure what's going on??.Any help would be appreciated!.Thanks again."
871503,NANUK,2014-09-09 10:37:00,797,"What are you targeting ? Kings ? Are you using wire, braid or mono ? What lures, leader length etc ? Tell us how you rigging it ? Dipsys ( wire diver ) work well on Lake Ontario, we run A-Tomik flies, meat and spoons of them and take a lot of fish on those set ups, They all require different leader lengths etc, Mind you dipsy is another effective tool just like riggers, leadcore, copper etc, Some days one lure / setup catches more than others."

While.Too many Herring maybe?,lolm"
871511,BillM,2014-09-09 11:52:00,17367,"Dipsys work great, the problem isn't your setup, it's the lake you're fishing.    Haul the boat down to Lake O and run that exact setup for salmon, you'll have a lot more fun."
871512,John Bacon,2014-09-09 12:03:00,3277,"You may want to try the #2 and #3 settings to get your baits out to the side of the boat; especially if you are running down riggers too.  If that doesn't work, you send your dipsys to me."
871526,Sinker,2014-09-09 13:30:00,8692,"Yep, set the two outsides on #3 setting. Thats the advantage of dipsys.....they get your lures away from the boat.  That said, I've never caught a laker on a dipsy. Tried many times with no luck. Mostly on shield lakes, but still, no lakers ever on dipsy's.  S."
871529,Tim Mills,2014-09-09 13:32:00,476,"I've only fished lake o with dipseys, I don't have my riggers installed but I have been able to catch fish with dipseys and lead core.  When I am on boats with riggers and dipseys the dipsey rods seem to catch just as many fish as the rigger rods. If you end up giving the dipseys a try on lake o as bill suggests, you may want to  stop in At shortwave marine in port credit, they have given me some good advice on set ups and baits that are working."
871536,BillM,2014-09-09 13:56:00,17367,"Also, no need to run the dipsys at a #0 or #1 setting, #3 for sure especially in the depths you're fishing.  Get those baits off to the side and away from the boat.  Although I wouldn't call lake trout a spooky fish.."
871561,davey buoy,2014-09-09 16:17:00,5505,"When I said 0 and 1,I was meaning dipsy sizes.Sorry for the confusion.We have been using the settings to keep them away from each other."
871562,captpierre,2014-09-09 16:24:00,2521,"I'm no expert but I know the Lakers are getting ready to spawn.  To my surprise, I caught one in 10 ft of water casting a shoal with a crankbait, on Simcoe in Sept."
871575,Old Ironmaker,2014-09-09 17:22:00,8243,"It may be a simple as the colour of the Dipsy, or they are not on the bite. They work here on Erie and out fished the riggers this year actually.  ""The Key Board Cowboy"""
871609,Fisherpete,2014-09-09 20:47:00,1814,Never tried them for lakers but most of my bigger salmon on Lake O seem to come off my dipseys.  Pete
871612,davey buoy,2014-09-09 21:00:00,5505,"Thanks guys for all the info.If I was to make that one trip down,maybe out of port Credit or Bluffers,What would be our best odds time wise/month/etc.This fall could be a option.?Also not giving to much away,are they closer to shore this time of year,or a few miles out.Thanks again."
871616,Steve,2014-09-09 21:11:00,2075,"your kinda done for the year, as far as hot fishing in lake ontario......  the area you're speaking of is hot more in June and July."
871617,BillM,2014-09-09 21:12:00,17367,"Davey, check out Spoonpullers for the latest info on Lake O.  Salmon are pretty much done in the lake but guys are still hitting lots of steel."
871619,Fisherpete,2014-09-09 21:20:00,1814,"Late June-mid August is typically the best time, you will catch some into September  From the bluffs head west and fish the ""drop off"", look at your charts and you will easily figure out where it is... Productive depths vary depending on bait location and water temperature, find the bait clouds and you will usually find some fish hanging around it  In years past I have done well in deeper water (180-220') but this year 90-120 was good and 60-80 as September approached and the salmon headed in shallow to stage for spawning  As for dipsies, I use the #1 size, on a 3 setting. If the bait is up high, or down low I run my dipsy accordingly. My main line is 80lb Powerpro.  Hope this helps!  Cheers Pete"
871622,davey buoy,2014-09-09 21:32:00,5505,"Thanks gentlemen for your help.,next year it is.Really appreciate the tips."
871626,spincast,2014-09-09 21:54:00,3279,"Dave - I don't know Simcoe at all (other than the one trip out with Brian), but on lake O I have only caught a laker on a dipsey a couple times.  Depth - 80 & 95 ft; wire set up 180 / 220  foot back, set on #3, black and white spin doctor, white fly, long lead between SD & fly (36 and 42 inch), and doing about 2.5 mph on the GPS - in June.  I will run the dipsey back till it bangs bottom  and make a note some days just to get a feel for how deep it is running. Picking up a copy of Precision Trolling will also give some good insight- Just remember once you start getting that far back and out, every element gets magnified - especially the sub surface currents.  Keep running them, they will produce. This year for me dipseys have under produced every other presentation - but usually they will boat the biggest fish.   Be happy to take you out on the water during laker season next year if you're interested."

Some of the best fast fishing of the year is almost here for Lake Ontario troll the harbor mouths with flatfish and it's game on"
871635,Steve,2014-09-09 23:17:00,2075,you are correct.  but the op was asking relating to dipsy's.  browns this time of the year are a freaking blast!!!
