Could anyone give us any info on atv conditions running from IBP on Simcoe heading north to Fox along the west side. I have not been out since Sunday, when there were some slush holes already forming. I hope to get out tommorow. Any help much appreciated."

I'm assuming with this snow were getting right now and the 30-40km/h winds tonight and in the morning there will be some serious drifts out there and things will possibly be tough going for quads good luck if your going tomorrow.
