213787,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 19:43:00,7971," No problem Johnny....was looking for some pics of sunburns in past posts but couldn't find them.  I remember posts about burned feet from sandal wearers, but couldn't find any of them.  Some pics that should have shown up that were hosted on other sites didn't show in the thread any longer.  I did a search for sunburns, but that returned about a bazillion threads.  I knew there were pics out there of people with burns, but they didn't mention them when they posted it, so search didn't help.  I hated having a bottle of sunscreen for that part of the song...your pic fit in quite nicely!"

210825,ccmtcanada,2008-06-04 17:03:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!!  The idea came to me during an all day workshop here at work.  I had the framework for the lyrics done by the end of that meeting.  I then spent probably 3 hours refining it and writing out the lyrics.  I then spent a little time bouncing ideas off of some people.  All told, the writing likely took 6 or 7 hours.  Then I had to record the audio.  I bought a karaoke version of the song online and got ready to record the lyrics.  The recording process took me about 5 hours.  The first 45 minutes spend adjusting microphone levels.  I then recorded 4 vocal tracks for it....then did them again for a total of 8 tracks.  I overlay all the identical tracks over one another to add some depth to the vocals.  Mixing and editing took another 5 hours.  Then the time consuming part came.  Hunting down pictures for it.  I tried as best I could to include a cross section of long time members as well as newer ones...and as much as I wanted to have everyone in it, I had to make some tough choices.  I wanted to be sure that as many species as possible made it into the song....despite varying opinions on the ultimate fish to target, we all share the same passion....the thrill of the fight.  The searching for pics likely took me about 10 hours total.  I finally needed help and emailed some members whose pictures I wanted, but couldn't find on the board.  I also put two public threads up about what your favourite pics were.  The next part was timing all the pictures, adding lyrics to the video and then making them all synch up to the song.  Total effort there was likely about 6 hours.  All told, it took about 33 hours of continuous time....that does not include the time thinking about what pics I wanted to find.  The intent was to convey the true ""moods"" of the board as seasons pass by.  I wanted to show all sides of what this board is....good and bad.  I also wanted the ""bad"" parts to be somewhat light hearted visually.  I'm pretty happy with how it turned out....glad to see that many of you also enjoy the video!  It's the people who make up OFC that made this song possible....without all of you, there would be nothing to write about!"

210647,TJQ,2008-06-04 12:08:00,7806,"Cliff (ccmt) put this together and asked that I post it...  I have to say that I am greatly touched by the time and effort he put in, that its efforts like this, that renew my faith in the board.  Thanks again!!     Here At OFC  New guy, fishing pole, see fish, can't catch, need help, what bait? Don't know where to  go. Google, click links, overwhelming, cant't think, too many net sites, my head is gonna blow Finally found one, OFC, looks good, introduce myself, lots of great replies. Hook ups, classifieds, buy stuff, ask for tips, photographs, more replies, I can't believe my eyes.  Here at OFC, it's a real community, no place I'd rather be. Here at OFC, we don't always get along, but we keep going strong.  Winter, hard water, freeze my butt, drill a hole, drop a line, leave it there, or begin to jig. Hands are numb, feel a hit, tip up goes up, start to reel, feel the fish, hope it's really big. Springtime,  ice is gone, shore spots, hit the tribs, prep the boat, tune the gear, gotta get out there Steelhead, panfish, hit the lake for Salmon, then comes pike, walleye, I don't really care  Here at OFC, it's a real community, no place I'd rather be. Here at OFC, we don't always get along, but we keep going strong.  Summer's here, all is good, shirt off, great reports, good moods, sunburns, sabiki rigs and fish porn Bass and Carp, catch a Ski, with your friends and family, sunsets, sunrise, get out in the early morn. Fall is here, chilly air, monster fish everywhere, one more cast, never know,  what'll bite your hook Hit the creeks , hunt some steel, try your luck on BOQ, throw a spoon from a pier, catch a brown or a nook.  Here at OFC, it's a real community, no place I'd rather be. Here at OFC, we don't always get along, but we keep going strong.  Tiller, console, pickerel, walleye,  photoshop, poaching, out of season  fish. C&R, too close, marshmallows, global warming, politics, hockey, how to use a net. 2 stroke, 4 stoke, flossing, snagging, right or wrong, secret spots, Why can't we just get along??  Here at OFC, it's a real community, no place I'd rather be. Here at OFC, we don't always get along, but we keep going strong.  Big hearts, well wishes, happy birthday, feeling sick, fish for Tyler, charities, people will come.. Get together, BOQ, Lakair, local bar, hook ups, tournament, it's all in good fun. Special thanks, to the mods, hard work, late nights, management, referee, all for you and me. Members, old and new, friendships, lots of laughs, best place on the web OFC Community.   Here at OFC, it's a real community, no place I'd rather be. Here at OFC, we don't always get along, but we keep going on and on and on and on……."
