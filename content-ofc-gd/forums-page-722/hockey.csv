435888,Stoty,2010-02-23 02:11:00,2910,"LOL, are you serious??   This is what I would have done:  Green for Seabrook Carter for Staal St.Louis for Bergeron Stamkos for Toews Lecavalier for Richards"
435929,F7Firecat,2010-02-23 03:13:00,347,anyone who thinks Canada is going to win gold in these olympics are probably Maple Leaf fans LOL

436010,canadadude,2010-02-23 14:16:00,769,"Now we're talking, this the talent needed for a gold medal, I would add Phenuf for Pronger, Pronger is nothing but a dirty embaressment to Canada and in fact International Hockey.  How many points does Green need to make our stinking olympic team? does he actually have to double all other defencemen in the league?  Midway into Feb and Stamkos has 35 goals, 4th in the NHL and he dosn't make the team but there's room for Bergeron. Canada's olympic roster is a joke period"
436037,blaque,2010-02-23 15:35:00,2419," Except, if, besides, ......We would have won if the U.S. didnt is all that amounts to lol  You guys will definitely bring it on and i predict win gold over the U.S. Im sure theres a bitter taste that will motivate them to the gold now. But i sure hope the Canadian team doesnt think like the above quote........or itll be much of the same.  I agree, the extra game for canada is an advantage......to meld the team a little further and get a feel for how to position things for the final run.  Good luck (and i mean that)"
436054,anders,2010-02-23 16:14:00,1168,"Its funny...if Canada won the game and didnt face a hot Goaltender, this conversation of who is there and isnt there wouldnt be happening...we would be plannig the gold medal party....but thats what makes us Canadian, and its AWSOME!  Like others said...no need to panic....just Believe in this team and get behind them."
436064,JohnF,2010-02-23 16:28:00,3494, Exactly. If winning was a given there'd be no reason to have these competitions.  I can understand Torontonians who cheer for Buffalo or whatever but I don't get it when Canadians cheer against their national teams. It would be one thing to ignore the whole competition but to get emotionally involved and cheer against your national team is weird.  JF
436087,Governator,2010-02-23 17:17:00,879,My and my boy will be glued to the game like the last one:  
436098,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-23 17:39:00,2690,"I almost feel sorry for Brodeur, the guy has stood on his head for so many years, to hear some of the comments being made, sad.  Personally, I would have had Luongo in for the game against the US...still don't know why Pronger is in the line-up, thought he sucked 4 years ago...a younger defenceman with wheels (take your pick) would have been a wiser choice."
436110,canadadude,2010-02-23 18:37:00,769,"I wouldn't say criticisizing a national team that for some reason leaves it's greatest tallents off the roster is exactly cheering against them. As a fan of the game it frustrates me to see how mismanaged our national hockey team is, because I don't think this group is good enough to win medal dosn't mean I'm any less Canadian."
436116,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-23 18:48:00,0,if they band together and the young guns pull this off there may be some armchair GM's eating crow.
436118,Twocoda,2010-02-23 18:52:00,4130, i posted a recipe for crow in another thread ...in case ya missed it ....here it is        http://www.crowbusters.com/recipes.htm   no ive never tried it ...but the author seems to recommend it
436121,John,2010-02-23 19:04:00,2956, That there is what it's all about!
436122,John,2010-02-23 19:07:00,2956," Damn Stoty, I'm almost gettin' to like you..............lol"
436123,F7Firecat,2010-02-23 19:10:00,347, oh I will be there cheering on my nation but i dont think Team Canada has the team to get it done. I hope I get proved wrong.
436254,Rizzo,2010-02-23 23:38:00,4754," instead of wanting him gone, maybe they should have had more guys like him. After all, who's going into the corners to get the puck? Who's throwing hits to remind the other team who they are playing? Guys like Bergeron are important. This team may be ""too many chiefs not enough..."""
436255,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-23 23:40:00,2690,Tonight's game will show what the team is made of...GO CANADA GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
436801,Stoty,2010-02-25 03:17:00,2910,Anyone still having doubts about the team?  Just like I said....here we come!
436811,JohnF,2010-02-25 03:30:00,3494, We're lucky we've got you to keep us on track. None of the rest of us saw that one coming.  JF
436817,chickenhawk,2010-02-25 03:45:00,612,looks liek the team yzerman picked isn't so bad after all 7-3 over russia...jus gotta have faith boys...stevie knows what he's doin

435529,Lunatic,2010-02-22 04:33:00,536,"Although i find it refreshing that he is a stand up goalie in a league of butterfly goalies who play 95% of the game on their knees,and he is usually so good with the puck he is like a 3rd defenceman,i'd be lying if i said i wasnt nervous every time a puck was shot in his direction.  I'm pretty sure LOU will be getting the next starts unless he plays soft."

435576,smally21,2010-02-22 14:21:00,993,"maybe it was miller's astounding performance that made broduer's look so poor, but there wasn't alot of understanding folks in the group i watched with. what was with his stick between his legs in the fourth goal?  never seen that before. and by the way its our right as canadians and as sports fans to carp and moan about our athletes. that is what the post is about is it not?"
435639,fisherman7,2010-02-22 17:10:00,325,"To be fair, he didnt' have a lot of support either!"
435640,Twocoda,2010-02-22 17:15:00,4130, are you kidding ???? the puck was in the american zone 80 % of the game ....what more support does he need??? maybe a chair to sit on while he drinks a Miller while watching a Miller?
435642,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-22 17:37:00,0,the US was outshot by 45-22 or something like that...if that isn't support i don't know what is.
435644,Ziki,2010-02-22 17:42:00,128, Did you even watch the game?
435645,Fang,2010-02-22 17:43:00,1330,"I hope they turn it around or it's gonna be brutal in the media. All I know is my Team Canada had Stamkos, St Louis and starting in goal would have been Luongo"
435647,canadadude,2010-02-22 17:47:00,769,"Hats off to the USA for getting in front of the net and frustrating Brodeur to the point of making mistakes. Sure Canada was all over the Americans but not rushing the net, Millar had clear view of 95% of the shots making his job alot easier. The only way to beat a hot goalie is to get in his face, hats off to the American defence for keeping the Canadian forwards away from the front of the net. Canada for one reason or another is doing a terrible job of controling the front of the net, the goalies in this tournament are the best of best if they can see the puck coming there going to stop it."
435649,canadadude,2010-02-22 17:50:00,769,"I totally agree, and Green and phanuf may have been a smart pick also, I still do not understand how these players aren't here."
435654,Aaron`,2010-02-22 18:02:00,25,"USA played a good game, we definitely did more then the USA on the offensive, Brodeur was a bit disappointing to say the least."
435655,Great Lake Steel,2010-02-22 18:07:00,41," Liimp wristed, poorly aimed attempts most of them.  I'd expect miller to block all of my 45 shots on net....."
435657,Fish4Eyes,2010-02-22 18:17:00,1022,Canada's offence needs to learn how to raise the puck when shooting.
435722,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-22 21:46:00,0,"  Miller made probably 5 highlight reel worthy saves in one game.  And Brodeur LOST the game for us on our end. In my eyes one goalie won the game for his team, another lost it."
435724,Aaron`,2010-02-22 21:49:00,25,Luongo gets the start vs Germany  http://www.ctvolympics.ca/hockey/news/news...html?cid=rsstsn
435745,steelhead hunter,2010-02-22 22:25:00,152,you can't be serious the best stop Brodeur made all night didn't even get close to him it was blocked by Doughty
435802,Stoty,2010-02-22 23:37:00,2910," Amen brother.  Green, St. Louis, Lecavalier, Carter and Stamkos should all be there.   As for last night's game.....if Brodeur didn't handle the puck...Canada wins hands down. He cost us 2 goals by trying to be Sami Sosa.  I love Marty to death and is by far the best goalie to ever play the game...but you're job is to STOP pucks dude not CLEAR them out of the zone.  Kudos to Miller, he made key saves when he had to.  I'm just glad this happened in the round robin, and not the medal round. We just have a tougher road to the GOLD than we had hoped!  I believe!"
435821,Jigger,2010-02-23 00:20:00,1237,"I still don't understand why Brodeur got the start in the first place. Should've let Fleury get the start, then you could at least get a good impression as to who the best goalie on your squad is. How many important games(read playoffs) have Luongo and Brodeur won in the last two years? Maybe Babcock has it out for him because of last year? Luongo got a shut out this Olympics, granted. But at the same time, he wasn't really tested and is, IMO, not the best goalie on the Canadian side. Neither is Brodeur. The best goalie is heating the end of the bench. IF anything, Babcock should've seen the read that the US squad had on Brodeurs play early on and made the switch at 2-0. Whatever, I hope they dont grip their sticks too tight on Tuesday..."
435825,holdfast,2010-02-23 00:23:00,1813,"Don't Panic Boys, look at the bright side, we get to play more Hockey, the Russians now have to play us.  As far as blaming Pronger Thornton and Bradeur, I still think they were good choices, if you ask me, half the team could use more heart.  I bet you if they get to play again, they will shine.  Canada out played them big time, besides the penalties, bad goals, it was Canadas game.  Dont Panic"
435835,Rizzo,2010-02-23 00:42:00,4754, ok so to make room for these guys who do you leave off? Crosby? Nash? Iginla? Getzlaf?There are many great players in Canada. You could obviously make 2 or even 3 teams that could win a medal..unfortunately you can only enter 1 team.
435840,Twocoda,2010-02-23 00:47:00,4130, lucky for the world we can only enter one team....well unless your talking about our bobsleigh teamS
435843,Jigger,2010-02-23 00:53:00,1237," Perry and Getzlaf immediately spring to mind. Green for Niedermeyer is also fair. Lecavalier isn't the same guy he once was. Mind you, neither is Brodeur but..."
435844,Twocoda,2010-02-23 00:56:00,4130, Mark my words ...dont count Perry out...something great is going to come out of him during these Olympics....
