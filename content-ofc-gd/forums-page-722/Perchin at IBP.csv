437097,Brian,2010-02-26 00:39:00,33,"Hey gang,  Well started out not sure what I should do this mornin.  Was to meet a guy at Fish Ontario this AM at 7, to switch cash for vex.  Wind howlin, snow startin to blow too, I was pondering just turning around and headin back home incase the weather got worse.  Shot back out to the 400 and traffic was backed up forever south bound, so I thought what the hell, may as well go fishin.  Paid my $10 for park entry, unload and headed for the ramp. Now I've never fished IBP before, so I just struck out into the unknown. First hole was in 30' and no takers for 15 minutes of effort. So I moved in closer and was reading 17'. Non stop action, one rod, two holes drilled, had my 50 before noon. We've already got half of them ate lol. My 20 month old son just loves em.  Sure was blustery out there today with no hut! But it was worth it. I'll be back thats for sure.  So there you have it.  All keepers were 9""- 11""  Brian"
437101,BillM,2010-02-26 00:47:00,17367,"Good job Brian!  You are a brave man to be out there today without a hut, lol.   I drove the truck out a few miles from 9th and made sure I used it as a wind screen."
437104,Terry,2010-02-26 00:51:00,14456,you picked a bad day to be standing out there but you had a good day
437129,Fisherpete,2010-02-26 01:44:00,1814,I was out there on Wednesday... the bite was tough in the deeper perch areas where I have been doing well this year (35'-45')... glad to see you got into them!
437136,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-26 01:56:00,2582,Any Herring while you where deeper? We had a 30-40 minute stretch 2 weekends ago in deeper perch water where we couldn't keep the Herring off our lines.  Glad to hear that you are getting them in shallower. I hate chasing them in deep water because of the fact they blow out there bladder so often.
437153,Fisherpete,2010-02-26 02:31:00,1814,"I didn't see any herring yesterday, but the deepest I ventured was only around 52'. The few perch I caught from that depth were kept out of necessity... as you mentioned, air bladder out the mouth!"
437288,fisher,2010-02-26 13:57:00,451,"Next time, save your $10 and drive one street further north of Innisfil Beach Road (9th line) and at the end of that street, you can park on the ice for free.  You will find the same fishing as IBP."
