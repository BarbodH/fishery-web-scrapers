In order to get accurate pack counts this seems to be the only way. Buying it is not yet in the budget, so anyone who can help, please PM me. I will be the only one using the equipment and take full responsibilty for it.  Thanks much"

436860,BITEME,2010-02-25 12:52:00,1968,We have some at the unit I will ask if you can use them  It would seem a waste of time though Rick they are very prolific and lets face it the food source in the area is fantastic they will breed like rats  Peter

Decent zoom but no image stabilzation so a tripod is advisable, they should be kicking around for a song now, might work for you.  EDIT: some of the trail cams have a infrared setup, with deer season over maybe one of the hunter could do with theirs for a while."

I have a feeling we found something we were not expecting, so it may be cool and I promise it will be here first if it turns out to be confirmed."

Any gen 1 unit won't meet your needs and mid-range gen 3 is even touch and go depending on ambient light.  I use ATN PVS 14s ($4000 list), which are decent out to about 100 yards in good light.  The units used by Canada's griffin helicopter pilots will give you the range your looking for, but at the cost of a small car.  I think you'd be better off getting your hands on a quality set of binos with good light-gathering ability.  Even in the middle of the night, its amazing what they will do with a little moon or star light."
