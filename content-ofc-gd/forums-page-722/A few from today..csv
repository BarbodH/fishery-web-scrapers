If anyone plans on going out there, don't even think about it if you don't have a 4x4.  I hit a old pressure crack that had a good 4ft snow drift built up against it and it completely enveloped the truck    I was in 4wd the entire time out there with brand new snow tires and it was a tough go.  Hit a couple places, popped a fish here and there then finally found the active fish...    I got the big one about 30ft off the bottom, just chased it forever...   "
