437139,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-26 02:02:00,2582,Workin the night shift. Woke up at 7 and missed the first period    Watched them win the gold... went out and shoveled the driveway. Now I think I'll have some good old Canadian Maple syrup on my pancakes and wash it down with a Timmies coffee.  Then go into work and say to everyone...our LADIES PLAYED A GOOD GAME EH.  All is right in my CANADA.
437335,blaque,2010-02-26 15:15:00,2419,"   These girls are AMAZING athletes and have excelled at something that they were told their whole lives they probably couldnt excel in or achieve....worked their whole lives toward this moment. Yet in the end, are still being told they'd be better off doing it half naked in mud.  Try raising a girl and you'll understand the frustration i have listening to this stuff constantly.  I applaud them for much more than just winning that game, but for the road they took to make it that far. Its alot harder than any road a man has traveled to get where they are."
