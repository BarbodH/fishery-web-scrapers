436923,CLofchik,2010-02-25 17:05:00,854,"Bayfront is coughing up perch fairly steady, with the odd small pike & trout. Ice has been good since it froze over, 4""-6"" right now.  Can't really say what the hot baits are, I don't fish down there just stop by walking the dogs.  P.S.  Whomever was in the blue Clam that had a hound dog pee on them, sorry about that."
