436853,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-25 12:25:00,158,"Nice fish everyone, this is great, fish porn for sure.  Here a few of me and the guys up on LOTW last season.  The first 2 are me, I am 6'6"" and I hate how small dudes make fish look bigger.  The third pic is of a guy who is like 5'7"" with a 4""7, looks bigger than the 49"" in the first pic.  The forth one is 46"" the guy is also liek maybe 5'7"". And the last one is my buddy with a 51"", he is about 6'3"" 6'4"" maybe.            Well just for fun here are some little guys.  I know of quite a few that got caught on LOTW last season, nice to know they are thriving.  The first little stinker was only 20"" and hit a 10"" Jake being trolled at 4mph, talk about aggressive.  Check out the gorgeous markings on the second one.    "
