436392,Mykester,2010-02-24 03:13:00,241,"Awesome pics guys. Quick question, when fishing creeks like these with a spinning reel, what type of tackle would you recommend? I've got my UL rod and 4 pound line, but i need something at the end of it! Catching chubs on the Humber is the most I've ever creek fished."
436393,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-24 03:18:00,0,  when i fish creeks i use a very small spinner or a woolly bugger fly and a few small steelhead shot.  i like to use single hooks and pinch my barbs. the barbs even on the smallest of spinners is pretty damaging to little parrs.  good luck alder bashing!
436398,Skud,2010-02-24 03:45:00,739,Great pictures Gents

435828,danc,2010-02-23 00:31:00,4677,This isn't my photo. I found it on the web some time back. It's perhaps the best Brook Trout photo that I've ever seen though. Kudos to the photographer.  
435834,wallacio,2010-02-23 00:41:00,475,Great thread - let's keep it going!  Here's a personal favourite...snapped by your's truly.  
435837,Sinker,2010-02-23 00:43:00,8692,"Yep, those specks live in some nice country, that's for sure. Half the fun is just getting where they live.          Its always worth it when your rewarded with this........    And some for you softwater guys too      S."
435846,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-02-23 00:58:00,1362,  Beauty color on that speckle Bill......love it!!!  A lot different from this stocked Speckie..

435881,S.M.05,2010-02-23 01:55:00,145,Certainly jealous of all the beautiful streams/rivers some of you have in your backyards. The specs are mostly in lakes around here with a few small creeks in between.  Cant complain though. Still gods country lake or river.        Since were sneakn in a couple spec pics....... heres one from a creek about 6 feet wide.   These are all back lake specs.     Fall kyped mouth spec     Cant wait to put a few miles on the new fly rod this summer.  And Steve I didnt know you hit up the browns last fall? Gonna have to tell me about it this weeknd on the trip.
435893,highdrifter,2010-02-23 02:19:00,2534," Wow!!  Yep.  Some lakes get fished out..  Word gets out that those lakes a trout factories..  They get added to the list.  And there's always a few fish that manage to elude fisherman and grrooowww!!  Last year's back country ice trip in Espanola..      3 days, crazy blizzards, righteous cold..  One fish.    Reality bites!  HD"
435919,xeon,2010-02-23 02:50:00,350,I'm surprised we haven't seen one of these... 
435942,Cookslav,2010-02-23 03:50:00,1457," Cause most Brookie haunts take a lot to get to, and are back in the boonies, so unless you've actualy already been there....you'd have no idea of where your looking at.   For exsample...this is one of my Prime spots. There is a hump of boulders that creaps up from about 20' to 6' with a mixed gravel/mud bottom flat on top...that fallen pine just sticking out is actually 2 trees. The trees rest right above the drop off....its a bloody spec gold mine on the deep end during the day, and it switches to the shallow gravel side at night when they feed at the surface.  If you can guess where it is I say cudos to you, and have at it. I pulled more then few out of that fallen pine on several occasions LOL... Just be ready to work for it  Cheers,"

436334,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-24 01:13:00,0,great vids ron.  it really is a nice boat ride.  the one day i went it had just finished raining for several hours...  there was intermittent waterfalls flowing down everywhere in the canyon.   i'll have to dig the pics out....  incredible country.
436336,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-24 01:14:00,0,"p.s. none of mine from THERE went in the pan, but when it comes to speck that are between 12-14 inches i'm eating the heck out of it!"

Canoeing countless lakes like these in nice sunny but cool skies....    That turn into uncertain weather like this...    That enables cool findings like this...
