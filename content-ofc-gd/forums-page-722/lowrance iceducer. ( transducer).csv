437037,irishfield,2010-02-25 22:41:00,26272,I doubt he's gonna share that info fishman.... I got my Lowrance iceducer off ebay last year. I hear they are out of stock directly this year...  One issue using them.. they have a narrower cone than a transom transducer. I'm actually considering going back to my transom trans as the ice one won't mark both jigs in some depths of water..
