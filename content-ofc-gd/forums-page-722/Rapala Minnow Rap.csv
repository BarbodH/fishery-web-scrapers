436262,tightline,2010-02-23 23:47:00,322,they were not hanging..they were in a bin...did you look there???
436264,Skud,2010-02-23 23:54:00,739,Yep
436266,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 23:57:00,849,Heart skips a beat....  Then sees tighline's post...Whew! I'm going up first thing in the morning to check the bins.  Think I might even know someone working there (I Hope). Stayed tuned folks.....  Michael
436269,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 23:58:00,849, Were there any MR11's at all in the bins?  Michael
436273,Radnine,2010-02-24 00:06:00,1538,The last time I was at Epps they had Cotton Cordell Wally Divers for 4 dollars odd. Regular price!! There is lots to make a stop there for as far as I am concerned. Jim
436282,Skud,2010-02-24 00:14:00,739,  Nope.  Made sure to dig around and get them all.
436291,solopaddler,2010-02-24 00:23:00,8605,C'est la vie. Thanks for looking Doug!
436292,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 00:23:00,849,"Seems to me you promised that earlier (yep - I checked - you did so!)  So do I let Solopaddler down and not go, or do I not fall into another one tonight (vance got me good earlier!) and go anyhow?  The suspense is killing me already....  FESS UP!  Or I'll call down the fishing gods curse on every one of your honey holes!  TWICE!  Michael"
436306,tightline,2010-02-24 00:38:00,322,  LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!! hope it works out for ya Solo...next time will pm for sure
436308,Skud,2010-02-24 00:39:00,739,  You caught me. No need to curse my fishing. We all know how poor I already am at it.  I bought everything.  
436310,tightline,2010-02-24 00:41:00,322,HAHAHAHAHAHAAAA And there they are....told ya guys
436314,solopaddler,2010-02-24 00:47:00,8605,  I hate you.
436322,Skud,2010-02-24 00:58:00,739,I can deliver them to your place Mike.........your cottage that is.
436323,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 00:58:00,849,"OK - I've called off the curse, wouldn't do that anyhow! Looks like you got a great haul there Skud!  Well done!  Hope you'll consider sharing with Solopaddler, I was going to grab 'em all just for him.  Did you just grab all the one color or were there any other colors in MR11 at all?  Solo-remember plan b, it could still happen!  I'll make a point of trying to.  Michael"
436324,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 01:00:00,849," Son of a.....  That's twice tonight I've been had!  Skud - you am a gentleman, I don't care what the rest of 'em say about ya!  Michael"
436326,solopaddler,2010-02-24 01:03:00,8605," That's a great idea let's make it happen.    Thanks again Michael, much appreciated."
436327,archie_james_c,2010-02-24 01:03:00,618, This is what I hear...Epp's seems to be a Gun and Tackle paradise!! I might make a road trip down there this year...bringing a hefty line of credit with me.    Very cool of you Skud
436330,Skud,2010-02-24 01:05:00,739,There are a lot of other Minnow raps at Epps and I didn't dig in the bin so there could be some more 11's in Purpledescent still in there. Great little store.
436332,tightline,2010-02-24 01:09:00,322,See now this is why I come to this site...Awesome end result...Way to pull together boys!!
436335,solopaddler,2010-02-24 01:14:00,8605, Exactly
436339,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 01:18:00,849," Thanks Skud! (go back a page and see what I said about ya!)  Solo - do you still want me to head up there in the morning?  Or has Skud got you covered now?  Let me know, I can still go if you want.  Michael"
436342,BillM,2010-02-24 01:20:00,17367,"  HAHAHHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Doug, you rock!!  That's hilarious!!"
436346,solopaddler,2010-02-24 01:25:00,8605,  I think I'm covered.
436349,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 01:29:00,849,OKAY then....  th th thththththththaaaaaat's all folks!  All's well that ended great for Solopaddler!  Michael
436972,adempsey,2010-02-25 19:35:00,1498,"Of course now, the hot color of the year is going to be Hot Steel. Lol."
435877,tightline,2010-02-23 01:45:00,322,Just wanted you guys to know I was at Epps this weekend and they have maybe 8-10 of the balsam purple spotted?? minnow rap like you guys were searching for there all in the 9-15 foot range I believe...anyone close looking for this lure there right under the till and there was plenty of them.
435890,ADB,2010-02-23 02:13:00,444,"Great eye, Tightline.  I'm sure Solo will be pleased."
435913,solopaddler,2010-02-23 02:40:00,8605,Thanks! Now I just have to find my way to Epps.  Now who do I know that lives up that way?  Oh Biiiill!
435931,BillM,2010-02-23 03:19:00,17367,*looks around*
435949,Skud,2010-02-23 04:01:00,739,If I get there first I am buying them all!
435972,solopaddler,2010-02-23 07:12:00,8605,"   I totally forgot about you Doug, save some for me please."
436099,archie_james_c,2010-02-23 17:43:00,618,"Just call EPP's up and ask them to ship you a bunch. They do mail order stuff all the time, they wouldn't have a problem shipping you some   ."
436108,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-23 18:36:00,0,Yer too late. I bought them all. SO.  ......How much to charge for the all sold out lure of choice?.......
436113,archie_james_c,2010-02-23 18:46:00,618,  Let the bidding commence at 29$ per each.
436117,solopaddler,2010-02-23 18:51:00,8605,  I'll trade them all for a big bag of that crappy egg cure you conned me into buying.
436127,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-23 19:16:00,0,well seeing how you feel about that....None for sale.!!!!!  ...  As far as a crap cure goes.    Meegs left a large bag of eggs by mistake in his house. Since the spring. He freaked out when he found it. He daringly took a wiff..  ....can you say fresh?.....  Like it came out of the fish an hour ago. I'd say not to bad for eggs that have been in a warm house for months.  One tablespoon for a whole large zip lock worth of roe. Thats it. If you over do it you can use them for singles hahahahahaha   and YES...Ill take it off your hands....lol
436129,solopaddler,2010-02-23 19:19:00,8605," Lure nazi!  (It's potent stuff all right, no denying that.)"
436134,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-23 19:23:00,0,I didnt buy any raps. They're all there for your taking. Good lcuk with em. And the cure of course...
436146,tightline,2010-02-23 19:48:00,322,Just had a flashback of sorts those lures are in the bargain bin I bekieve and are only 7 bucks a pop...just to add some fuel to the fire...LOL
436148,solopaddler,2010-02-23 19:53:00,8605, I figured as much.    Oh great now there's going to be a mad rush on Epps. You know you could've pm'd me.
436151,tightline,2010-02-23 20:00:00,322,"yeah I could have I guess Solo sorry about that, but that wouldn't be fair to everyone else...Now you know what there worth though if ya do get sombody to pick'em up they won't be able to soak ya on the price??? LOL if thats any consolation"
436154,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 20:10:00,849,Solopaddler - If you want to pm the picture & details you posted before I might be able to help out.  It wouldn't be out of my way at all to go to Epps in the morning to see if they have exactly what you want.  Couple of options exist to get them to you from there...  Michael
436157,solopaddler,2010-02-23 20:18:00,8605, But....but....I was the one who was looking for them.  Betcha I'm single handedly responsible for Rapala reinstating the Minnow Rap in the Canadian market.
436158,tightline,2010-02-23 20:18:00,322,I believe they are the MR11 purple spotted?? They are in the bin right under the cash register to the left of the leathermans... Hope it works out for ya Solo
436160,solopaddler,2010-02-23 20:22:00,8605," Thanks for the offer Michael. Don't want you to go out of your way, but if you do get the chance I'm primarily looking for #11's in the Purpledescent colour, but any #11's would do!   (You will be my new best friend if you come through.  )  Cheers"
436162,tightline,2010-02-23 20:27:00,322,(You will be my new best friend if you come through.  )  Cheers  HA!!! Nevermind the keen eye that found them in the bin on sale and reported for ya...I feel used...dirty almost...Lmao
436163,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 20:29:00,849,Well... It's about 9km from here to the City Centre (or what Orillia has to pass for one).  The Mall (where I'm going anyhow) is in the north end and Epps is a few minutes north of there.  Might take me a whole whopping 10 minutes out of my way AND give me a chance to wander around a tackle shop...WHAT a HARDSHIP!  I'm sure it's gonna be a challenging task but...what the heck. Assuming they're 7.00 like Tightlines said - how many ya want?  Better yet - how much ya wanna spend would be a better question? And who do ya know that can pick them up on the weekend in the Innisfil Beach Road & 400 area (very large well known market there). Michael
436165,solopaddler,2010-02-23 20:38:00,8605,"      Sounds good Michael, thank you! I'll take all the #11's just to make it easy. BillM should be able to grab them. Check your pm's"
436179,cheaptackle,2010-02-23 21:01:00,849,PM replied to Mike.  Michael
436261,Skud,2010-02-23 23:46:00,739,I just got back from Epps. They don't have ANY purpledescent Minnow raps now. The words out I guess.
