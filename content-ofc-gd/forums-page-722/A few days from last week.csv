The whitefish trip to Shoal lake is now a tradition for me since glen took me there 2 years ago...this was our third trip out together and by far the slowest day of the 3. We hit the same marks as previous years and caught some really nice whities , a ton of cisco/tulibee/herring which we will use for pike in the spring and Paul hooked into a beauty 38"" Northern Pike. The fish were in 40'-60' FOW, not many suspended fish....mostly coming off the bottom to smack the bait ten feet up. The whities were really fussy that day...and everyone changed bait tactics numerous times to try to induce a bite....they were there in numbers...just being really picky and hard to entice.  Here's some video and pics from the day...........   SHOAL LAKE VIDEO     A FEW PICS FROM OUR DAY ON SHOAL LAKE              LOVE THIS PICCY>>>>LOOKS LIKE PAUL SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTED>>>>LOL      After that i had a 2 day break from fishing then hit a couple of Local lakes 2 days in row. First off was a trip to Dore lake.....only had about 2 hours 2 fish...but the bite was on and despite having to wait a while for the bite when it came my quota for supper took 15 minutes....no huge fish...but all around 16""...perfect eaters!   WHEN THEY BITE....IT DONT TAKE LONG     SUPPER!!!!      The next day i headed out to Eagle Lake, it was a much slower 2 hour session with one missed bite and then my PB walleye of 25"" (pb whilst ice fishing). I did not even bother to try and record a video of the catch...she was full of eggs and i got her back down the hole ASAP to complete her yearly business and provide me with generations of  walleye for many years to come... hopefully.  MY PB WALLEYE THROUGH THE ICE         KIND OF PROPER FOR EAGLE LAKE'S NAMESAKE TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE    "
