436500,GBW,2010-02-24 14:37:00,8460,you mean I might get to use my new snowblower before the warranty is up?!?!?!

436572,BillM,2010-02-24 17:39:00,17367,Not much for up here.
436573,wallyboss,2010-02-24 17:40:00,1095,GBW  let's hope that your snowblower can be turned in a gas powered water pump if needed.
436575,cheaptackle,2010-02-24 17:42:00,849,"I already cleared 5"" (deeper in the drifts) yesterday and they're saying another 1"" today (got about 3/4"" last night), PLUS 2 to 5 inches tomorrow (Orillia Area) and again Friday.  Been reading about a lot of guys with new blowers they haven't used yet this season - y'all are invited to try them out here!  I'm on my 3rd 2-1/2 gallon can of gas since the beginning of the year!

436682,bucktail,2010-02-24 23:21:00,1857,Good to see a nice dumping otherwise the tributaries would be awfully low this spring. Its nice to have a good old fashioned blizzard every once and a while.
436684,fishing n autograph,2010-02-24 23:30:00,2540,I have to say I'd rather have no snow....the commute east across the 401 in a blizzard sucks....lol
