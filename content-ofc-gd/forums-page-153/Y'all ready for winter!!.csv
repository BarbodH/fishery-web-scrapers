940120,fishindevil,2015-10-17 16:19:00,6254,Yup I'm ready !!!!
940249,chris.brock,2015-10-17 21:33:00,4053,"Great sled, solid Phazer engine, good for ice fishing and fun for the trails too, I'm a Yammi guy too.  Anytime! I will likely do a G2G thing again in early March, see if we can get more than just Kewley and I out, haha  Shawn, do you get a new sled every 6 months? Hahaha What's the story?"
940251,fishindevil,2015-10-17 21:44:00,6254,No Chris not every 6 months every 12 months !!! Lol ... I have had 3 new sleds last 3 years just trade them in on a new one every year on a spring order sled !!! Gonna keep this one for a few years when I get it in a few weeks .... When you get a spring order only sled you have to order them almost a year ahead as they are special order only and carry a lot better resale and of course a higher price .... Fishing & sledding 2 very expensive life choices ..... Lol ... Yup

Doesn't even put his coat in..  Just his rubber boots.  Finds the hidden key to the garage, and beats me outside..  This is where I found him...  Begging for a ride.    But there was no snow.  Just a few patches on the deck..  It took some explaining to him why we couldn't go for a ride.  Love this kid!"

I'm sure there are some theories out there when to swap....  I'm all ears.  G  Do like 90% of my customers do   try and get them on RIGHT AFTER the first weather watch is announced; just like today!!!!!!!!!!! My phone here hasn't stopped ringing; Dan I need my snows on, can I come in now. Sorry you'll need to take a number, we're working on #30 now and the last person to book is #80; I'll call you. So if the shop that you deal with has time, get them on anytime after Thanksgiving and avoid the rush. The amount of tire you're going to wear off would be un-measurable. It's a crap shoot; put them on to early and you wear a little bit of tire; to later you're kicking yourself; so throw the dice?  Dan.  P.S.  Give the shop you deal with some slack when it comes to putting the snows on; we're working our ass off trying to accommodate."

940021,NAW,2015-10-16 22:49:00,4022,I'm crazy excited about ice fishing.   Can't wait for first ice.  Gunna be a long 2 months.  But I just got my boat back from storage.  So maybe I'll scratch the itch with some Simcoe perch.   As far as timing on snow tires.. I have a set in my garage in steel rims that I out on when the snow starts to fly.  I may put them on tomorrow morning.

The track on my tundra needs replacement, so 'not ready'  I bought a riding mower with a snow blower attachment, but I don't know if it'll work well, so 'not ready'  I hear it'll be a milder winter that last year, so 'ready!!'"
