East beast wind was big. Waves were even bigger. But as Mike said... ""Big weather = big fish"". The day did not disappoint. I lost a good one at the very first casting spot of the day. Trolling soon led to Mike hooking into a giant 48"", and I closed out the day with my best fish of the year, a seriously obese 46.5"". The fall feedbag has certainly begun!  Thanks again Mike for a really great day on the water.  Cheers Pete           "
