Why haven't you have listed all the mistakes the federal Liberals made time and time again?  No need to list anything about the provincial liberals because we can't VOTE them OUT tomorrow.... It is best to concentrate on sending Harper off on the rubber chicken circuit first. Plenty of time to air the facts on Wynn's tenure when she is actually on the ballot... Also some of the court cases might be settled by then. Assuming the Ontario Conservatives can run a candidate that isn't a complete failure like the last 2 times, it should be a land side of epic proportions."
940439,FrankTheRabbit,2015-10-18 21:04:00,479," Personally, I would trust information provided by a group, as long as it's honest and unbiased. The fact that I was able to find one thing left out, leads me to believe that there would be more items that weren't included in their report.  Here's something else that wasn't part of the CTF Report for the CPC: The New Canada Building Plan that suppose to go till 2023-2024 and guess how many millions that will run...sorry, my mistake, not millions, but billions and to be exact, it's $80 billion, for an average of almost $9 billion per year or $2.25 billion for that first fiscal quarter. This is not something I'm pulling out of thin air, but right on the CPC website: http://www.conservative.ca/harper-announces-the-quebec-maritime-prosperity-initiative-to-foster-job-creation-and-support-quebecs-maritime-strategy-2/  So again, why was this omitted in the CTF report and again, what else has NOT been included in their report?  EDIT: Sorry, I mis-read the amount earmarked for The New Canada Building Plan budget and said it was $80 billion. To quote from the source:  ""That is why we have introduced the New Building Canada Plan, an unprecedented initiative totalling more than $80 billion proposed by the Conservative Government to fund infrastructure projects over the next decade that will benefit all provinces, territories and municipalities.""  So, the initial $80 billion amount seems to be the minimum and again, this was not included in the CTF report. You really gotta wonder if it's even possible to run a budget of $256 million for the first quarter fiscal of 2016/2017 and really question what the actual amount is. Cleary, the CTF is picking and choosing what they want you to read, which is why I can't accept the report as accurate or truthful."
940466,Henricus,2015-10-19 01:37:00,118,"I thought I was done with this but I thought I would address some points raised by Canuck2fan...  re: new deficit spending - consider the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and the fact that the budget is now in surplus.  As for the law, OMG, a broken election promise.  Ontario has proven time and time again nobody cares about broken election promises.  re: trade deficit - consider inflation.  Do you believe it won't be trumped in the future?  During any economic cycle in which the world is not in need of our resources, expect a record trade deficit.  re: bailout - who cares?  Would you rather the banks failed?  Your solution would have been???  re:  youth unemployment - see comments about economic crisis.  Also, how are we relatively speaking?  Perhaps compare our numbers to a European country or two?  re: dollar - Ironically, by your rationale, you could also say that he drove the dollar to its highest level in far longer than 10 years.  Incidentally, the record low dollar was in 2002 nearing the end of an extended liberal reign.  re: oil companies - that ship has sailed.  The NDP in Alberta will be the final nail in the coffin for Canadian oil companies.  Good luck when Chinese companies establish an even greater footprint in our energy patch.  Be careful what you wish for?  The remaining points work out in the wash with any government.  Nobody will be perfect as has been proven over and over throughout history.  The reality is we are seeking the best alternative and in as much as you are clear you don't believe it is Harper, I feel equally strong in that it is also none of the other candidates.  Clearly somebody from this forum should run as it seems to have all the answers ;-)"

940494,John Bacon,2015-10-19 14:24:00,3277, Drove the dollar to it lowest level in over 10 yrs making almost everything more expensive for everybody and still the trade deficit grows LARGER.   You are complaining that someone who has been Prime Minister for 9 and 3/4 years has had the lowest dollar in the last 10 years?  That is not a lot different than complaining that Harper had the lowest doller since Harper became Prime Minister.  Canada also had the highest dollar in in over 40 years while Harper was Prime Minister.  And the dollar slipped lower under the previous Liberal government than it did under Harper.

I can not see my self voting for a guy just because he is the son of a former PM...and the other big thing for me is this triumbrant of fools that tried to take down a elected government....can you imagine what could have happened if these 3 fools were allowed to rule the country pandering to a party that who`s one mandate is to break up this country during one of the toughest economic times in our history....I will have no part in voting for a party that was on board with this!!!

This is a commitment. You will judge me by that. If the GST is not gone, I will have a tough time the election after that."" - Liberal Leader Jean Chretien 1993 - Liberal Party Red Book: ""A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and to small business, minimizes disruption to small business, and promotes federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization."""

Still waiting for law after 4 yrs of him the absolute power to do so. Don't worry though his finance minister is on the record as saying that Harper's granddaughter will pay that off in the future with her mystical credit card.  Responsible for the worst trade deficits in Canadian history, coupled with the LOWEST corporate tax rates in Canadian history.  Gave Canadian banks a 114 Billion dollar bailout during the recession and has denied doing it every since.  Highest youth unemployment rate in Canadian history since we kept stats.  Drove the dollar to it lowest level in over 10 yrs making almost everything more expensive for everybody and still the trade deficit grows LARGER.  Has allowed oil companies to gouge us at the pumps to the tune of over 5 BILLION dollars and said not a word.  Has let Canadian companies hide 200 Billion in profits offshore so they paid no Canadian tax on that money. What did he do about that? He gave the company representing the tax cheats against the CRA a huge government contract as a reward for fighting the CRA in court...  He has also tried to sneak through multiple pieces of legislation he was told WOULD BE struck down by the courts costing us the taxpayer millions in unnecessary court costs.

939544,Henricus,2015-10-14 03:49:00,118,"It is difficult to form or maintain an objective opinion by reading biased accounts from others whether on this site or from a popular media source.  Citing numbers from various different sources results in comparing apples to oranges.  The reality is you can virtually map the surplus/deficit chart over a similar chart of the rate of change in economic growth.  Governments don't control the global economy so they are at the mercy of rising and falling tax revenue based on the performance of their underlying local economy.  In the 60's there was a lot of wiggle room in the budget since the national debt was miniscule as compared to today's situation.  Over the years, the deficits have piled up and the debt has grown to the point where there is no wiggle room left.  Before the debt became so great it was easy to stimulate the economy with government spending and if the stimulus or policy didn't work out it wasn't a big deal.  That is no longer the case, with the debt level where it is and the threat of rising interest rates, the noose is only going to get tighter.  Frankly, you are voting for the lesser of several evils.  Eliminate the ridiculous pensions earned by politicians and you might actually get somebody in power looking to improve the country, not just line there own pocket.  In my opinion 'Politician' should not be a career.  I would venture to say that almost everyone on this forum either continues to work or has worked (prior to retirement) harder than most if not all politicians.  Vote for whoever you think will work as hard as you do, be it your local candidates or the national leaders.  At least your conscience will be clear."

If I don't get insulin I don't go to rehab to kick Diabetes and deal with withdrawals. I don't learn to eat better. I don't get a pancreas transplant paid by OHIP, I die. So if I pay for it from my pension I loose my home to stay alive. What choice do I have? Do what you have to do to stay alive, or just sit back and wait to die? This is absolutely insane.

I am also appalled that in 2015 a secret trade deal couldn't be shown the populations of the 18 countries involved until it was struck, but 600 corporate consultants were there with all the details the whole time?  I can relate in a very small way to your pension situation. I am one of the executors for an aunt who passed away 7 yrs ago, we are STILL waiting to finalize her estate because the company she worked at stole her pension in a bankruptcy. The Ontario government used to look after settling this type of situation, but have farmed it out to private businesses. We have had 2 different companies handling it because of corporate mergers and 4 different people as contacts. My aunt was very lucky in that she didn't need the money while alive and now it is just a matter of being able to disperse it to her beneficiaries (2 of who have also passed away) to finally settle her estate. We do know people she worked with though who are waiting who desperately NEED their money.  The ironic thing is a really good friend of the family was a manager there and when we asked him about it, he said he was shocked because he got his entire severance payout and pension the DAY THE PLANT CLOSED..."
939152,Henricus,2015-10-12 04:10:00,118,"For years Alberta led the provinces in terms of economic growth.  With oil prices currently well below recent averages it no longer holds that position.  Add to that an NDP government and Alberta is in trouble.  Ontario has actually seen a mild resurgence in manufacturing, not because of the Liberal government but because natural gas prices in North America are a third of what they are in either Europe or Asia.  With China's economy slowing, Canada's natural resources are no longer in demand like they were prior to the financial crisis.  The moral of the story is neither our federal nor provincial governments have anything to do with global economic trends.  Fiscal responsibility is a necessity as a result of years of overspending.

That is not quite as simple as you make it out to be.... Also if Alberta and Newfoundland weren't on top of rotting dead dinosaurs they would always have been have not provinces.  http://cwf.ca/commentaries/ontarios-economic-woes-much-exaggerated  http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/04/01/equalization-payments-ontario-canada_n_2992486.html  Funny; you claim that Harper should have given Canada great economic numbers during a world wide recession; but make excuses for Ontario doing worse than the other provinces.  Alberta and Newfoundland had oil when Ontario was leading Canada in economic growth.  And Ontario would always be a 'have not' province too if it did not have resourses resources either.
939155,Canuck2fan,2015-10-12 04:53:00,1444,"The moral of the story is neither our federal nor provincial governments have anything to do with global economic trends. Fiscal responsibility is a necessity as a result of years of overspending. Don't vote for who you think is going to turn China's economy around, vote for who you think is going to manage your tax dollars like you manage your own money.  I absolutely agree don't vote for Harper's trickle down economic failure for another 4 yrs.... 156 billion in new national debt from a guy who supposedly has a masters in economics? Biggest trade deficit with China in our history, if you want to create jobs in China Steve is your guy. He even signed a secret trade deal to make sure no Chinese corporation will have their potential profits hampered by any pesky law our sovereign government passes.  Also remember that In the last 19 yrs the cons have been in power in Canada they have added over 400 billion to our national debt with deficit spending and posted only 3 balanced budgets in those 19 yrs, so they most certainly DO NOT look after our money very well."

I don't excuse Ontario's poor economic performance either... I was merely pointing out the fact that Ontario which you labeled a have not province still put in 11 billion more to the federal coffers than we took out. Seems sort of wrong to me to be labeled a taker when in fact we were giving more than we got. But whatever floats your boat.

939325,GbayGiant,2015-10-13 03:56:00,1780,"By The Canadian Press — The Canadian Press — Oct 12 2015 OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Stephen Harper played game show host Monday to demonstrate the thousands of dollars Conservatives claim would be taken from the average family's pocket if Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau were to win power on Oct. 19. To the constant ""ka-ching, ka-ching"" chirp of a cash register, Nicole Ropp, a married mother of three, piled up $20 bills as Harper rhymed off a list of a purported tax increases Canadians can expect from a Liberal government. For the Ropp family, it all added up to about $8,000, according to Harper. However, Harper's list included a number of alleged tax hikes that aren't on the Liberal agenda and omitted a number of other measures aimed at giving middle class families more, not less, money. What Harper said: A Liberal government would limit contributions to Tax-Free Savings Accounts. What Liberals are promising: This is correct. Liberals would cap the annual amount Canadians can sock away in TFSAs at $5,500, rolling back the Harper government's recent increase to $10,000. Liberals maintain increasing the cap would benefit primarily the wealthy. What Harper said: Liberals would ""cancel child care cheques for some families ... That's nearly $2,000 per year per child under the age of six and over $700 for children between 6 and 17 — gone."" For the Ropp family, he said that would amount to a loss of $3,360 per year. What Liberals are promising: Harper didn't mention that the Liberals are proposing to replace the Conservatives' existing universal child care benefit with a new monthly, tax-free child benefit. Liberals maintain their benefit would give more money to 90 per cent of Canadian families than they currently receive. However, the benefit would be gradually phased out for those earning more than $150,000. What Harper said: Liberals would eliminate the tax advantage enjoyed by couples with children by allowing them to split their income for tax purposes. What Liberals are promising: This is correct. Trudeau has promised to scrap income splitting for parents, pointing to studies which have shown the benefits flow primarily to the wealthiest 15 per cent of families. Contrary to Conservative attack ads which infer that Liberals would also scrap income splitting for seniors, Trudeau has repeatedly said he'd keep that tax advantage in place. What Harper said: Liberals would make $6.5 billion in cuts to tax credits and deductions in order to balance their budget in the fourth year of a first mandate.  Among other things, the child fitness credit, the children's art credit and the volunteer firefighter tax credit are all ""likely on the table."" What Liberals are promising: As part of their plan to find $6.5 billion in savings, the Liberals have promised to review boutique tax credits and deductions that have multiplied like topsy over recent years, with an eye to reducing benefits that unfairly go to those earning more than $200,000 a year. They have not identified which tax benefits could be cut, other than to propose a cap on stock option deductions. As for the specific credits Harper predicted would be cut, Trudeau said Monday: ""We're not going to be cutting those tax credits."" Not all the Liberals' anticipated savings would come from cutting tax credits and deductions. Other savings would come from a promised crack down on tax evasion, reducing the government's advertising budget and reducing the use of external consultants. What Harper said: Liberals would increase payroll taxes by hiking Employment Insurance premiums. What Liberals are promising: Liberals are promising to reduce EI premiums in 2017 from $1.88 per $100 of insurable earnings to $1.65. That is not as steep a cut as that promised by Harper — to $1.49 by 2017 — but it's still a reduction. What Harper didn't say: He didn't mention that the Liberals are promising to cut taxes across the board for Canadians earning between $45,000 and $90,000, tax relief Trudeau says is worth up to $670 per person, per year. Nor did Harper mention that Trudeau is also promising to hike taxes on the wealthiest one per cent of Canadians. "

The world wide economic situation would have contributed to both.  However, Canada didn't do too bad compared other countries.  Ontario fared poorly compared to other provinces.  I believe that Canada's debt to GDP ratio has actually improved slightly since Harper came to power.  I doubt the Ontario ratio has improved.  Canada has a lot of debt; but we do not have the highest debt of any country in the world.  Ontario has the highest debt of any state/province, etc. in the world."

I'm no fan of Stephen Harper, but some of the math that Trudeau is selling you guys as fact is just wrong.  The ""putting money in the pockets of 9/10 households"" just doesn't seem possible to me.   The income splitting benefits almost 70% of 2 parent families, not ""the richest 15% of Canadians"".  That whole concept is a complete lie.  A family with 2 parents, 2 kids will lose: - up to 2k in income splitting - up to 10k in TFSA room If combined to earn over 150k  they're losing $2400 in UCCB So if you make >150k as a family, know that you're 4400+ in the hole next year, plus whatever future benefit you would have seen from 10k in TFSA contributions.    I'm not saying Harper is a better option, just pointing out that Trudeau isn't being completely truthful here either."

The one big thing he has going for him IMHO is that he doesn't pander to Wynne.  Somethings to think about.... The context of the statement that budgets balance themselves is not something that the cons want to discuss. The context was, The liberals believe if you spend the money on infrastructure that give businesses and people what they need to thrive then the economy grows and people get jobs and MORE tax revenue is generated by a GROWING economy.  Not too much different from the cons trickle down view, that if you give businesses all the tax breaks and perks they will increase productivity and hire more people and the economy will grow and the tax break will be recuperated.... Except after 9 yrs of that strategy it is not working and the cons record of the WORST economic performance since WWII of any government clearly proves that.  So something is missing, business profits are up, over all productivity from Canadian workers is WAY up. So why is the trade deficit growing so much? Why are Canadian corporations hoarding 600 million in profits off shore that they aren't paying taxes on, even though they would be paying the least amount of tax EVER in Canadian history? When is enough money enough to just sit in a corporate bank account? I have no problem with corporations making profits, paying their share, and hiring Canadians to work in Canada, but they sure seem to have a huge problem with doing either under Harper for some reason? Could he be in on the tax evasion?  http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/harper-government-partnered-with-industry-group-battling-cra-over-kpmg-case-1.3257994  Lastly, WE NEED a federal government to pander to Ontario who like it or not is run by Wynn so voting for a government that keeps hurting Ontario with crappy secret trade deals only makes sense if you live elsewhere...  or are rich enough you don't care about making money anymore."

I heard a radio spot the other day that Trudeau was touting his economic plan as he was the only one that was willing to carry a deficit in his first few years, touting debt as a positive thing...lol.

Not another call from anyone. I always try and get to know our MP, MPP, Mayor or Councilman. If I have needed them during their term and most importantly how they helped me counts a lot. Dianne Finley is our MPP. Her office helped me immensely when it came to straightening out my CPP contributions that were short due to a clerical mistake 40 years ago. However, she has been absent in the Caledonia/First Nations stand off and near riot in Caledonia, her and her parties silence in the US Steel fiasco here in Haldimand and Hamilton is deafening. So for me it's a tie. Back to square one.  Am I better off, worse off or about the same when it comes to quality of life after being Governed by what ever government that I have lived with since they have come to power. That way I can filter out all the Bull I hear and read about an election. So with that in mind I will vote. Don't ask me who is running for the Libs or NDP, I haven't seen a sign, a card in the mail, a call or absolutely nothing. It looks like they have both conceded.

If he had really wanted to ban ""anything"" he had a majority to ram through any vote for the last 4 yrs so all this crap about what people wear is just a distraction, created by his Aussie lap dog.  The most disappointing thing of all, is that he has proven to be a total coward, more interested in saving his own skin than in being a true leader. Time and time again he has tossed loyal friends, employees and party members under the bus instead of standing tall and admitting he isn't perfect.  The last reason I couldn't vote for the cons is at the riding level is his candidate (trying to replace a useless incumbent) bought the kool aid and has refused to show up for some key debates... If you can't face us the voter in a few 2 hr debates NO WAY am I going to trust you for the next 4 yrs.  Mulcair.... I am not sure the NDP has the apparatus as a whole to run a country that would automatically expect them to fail. I look at the hatchet job everyone is doing to the NDP in Alberta, blaming them for things that any sane person would realize were going to happen to any government their with oil at 40.00 a barrel.  At the local level GREAT candidate, who is open and will stop and talk about the issues..  Trudeau.... Is probably the smartest of them all in that he seems to realize the country needs a TEAM to get things going in the right direction. He wants to open up government and despite what all the neocons would have you believe our best FINANCIAL times in Canada have always been under the Liberals. The economic numbers over the years don't lie.  At the local level the candidate is always at the debates, pounding the pavement and also has a good grasp of the issues.  Greens are a non vote as I think they got like 500 votes out of 70K last time out.  The worst outcome for me would be another Harper majority, next an NDP majority LOL.

The NDP have never held power at the federal level; however, they have helped get a lot of social programs in Canada either by holding the balance of power in a minority or just having enough to support for the other parties to realize that they cannot completely ignore their ideas.  Other parties such as the Green Party or the Marijauna party can also influence the government if they receive support.  If it is a minority government, the few seats that they do win may be very important.  Even if they do not win enough seats to hold the balance of power; support to these parties can send a message that people support their causes.  Increased support for the Green Party tells the other parties that the environment matters; support for the Libertarian party indicates that people want smaller government, support for the Marijauna party indicates that people do support the legalization of marijauna.  If support for these parties increase; the mainstream parties will realize that these issues matter to people and they will need to address them.  "
