938908,Fisherman,2015-10-10 13:24:00,7201,"Used to fly and boat, lots of fun.  One of these days, maybe a small plane again.  Still have a 3 foot electric tug and a 6 foot sailboat."

Might put floats on the cub and take it to the cottage next summer for the middle boy, should be fun!"

939141,206,2015-10-12 02:58:00,563,I used to race R/C many years ago my last car was a Losi JRx2 tricked right out.  I often find myself googling and veiwing youtube video's of R/C toys....Man have they come a long way!!
939149,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-12 03:50:00,10439,I want one of these RC planes.  
939158,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-12 06:00:00,8243,"There is an RC airport/club on a farm down the road. I've stopped to watch when I see a group of guys ""playing"" with their toys. They can get serious and I quickly found out they are not ""playing"". When I found out how much one of their planes or Choppers cost they sure aren't playing. I've paid less for cars that I can drive on the road. We used to have a clay tennis court at the back of the property that I let go to weed. A few years back neighbours asked if they could put in an RC track, be my guest. They brought in a few yards of soil and made rails with weeping tile complete with jumps etc. In the winter they actually had RC Snow machines.They haven't used it for a few years because the kids are all in their 40's now and their kids destroy the big kids off roaders. It is fun. I tied about 20 yards of line on one of those RC boats the neighbours grand kids had and a Rappala but got skunked. They tried for days and finally caught a Smallie, that was neat to hear the kids screaming."
939377,mepps,2015-10-13 13:48:00,1301,"As a child I always had the cheap Radio Shack RC's and dreamed of having a nice one. When my eldest son turned 7 last year I decided it was a good time to get a fast RC for him (and me!). I didn't wanted to spend too much and most faster RC cars aren't recommended for young kids. I found a great little car from Dromida (http://www.dromida.com/ - they also do helicopters) that was around $120 and hits around 40km/h. The cars from Dromida also have a great feature, you can adjust the throttle back for kids or people just learning. I've been very impressed with the build quality - these new car are 10x better than the ones I had as a young lad! We have had a blast with it so far, but he's already asking for something bigger and faster to go off road! I highly recommend these if you have a child showing interest in RC cars.  Here his is landing his first front flip off the curb - https://instagram.com/p/uehmH4sfaQ/"

We fly a mixture of gas engine planes and electric engine planes at a sod farm near Queensville.  I am in the process of building a WWII Mustang which will house a gas engine when done. It it quite large with 60"" wingspan and built from balsa. It is my new winter hobby!"

939899,GBW,2015-10-16 02:00:00,8460,"I had an old ""falcon"" track car growing up (still have it too but just never tried to bring it back to life). Got my kids a few basic trucks to tinker with while at the cottage so I may have to see if the falcon can be reborn and if so, yeah I'll be back in the 4 wheel hobby version of RC"

Ask for new ones every christmas lol  Eventually id destroy them building jumps and just doing silly stuff with them  One of my friends flies planes now and he helped me fil alot of my sturgeon footage with my gopros.  Hes an awesome pilot but im always nervous he'll losw my cameras lol  Hes a spaz he can fix or rig anything lol, and hes almost 60!
