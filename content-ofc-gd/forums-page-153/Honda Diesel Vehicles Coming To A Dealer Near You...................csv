938840,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-09 19:53:00,10439,Interesting article on Honda's new diesel engines coming to North America soon.  http://www.caranddriver.com/news/honda-to-launch-clean-diesel-in-the-us-within-three-years-car-news
938841,Big Cliff,2015-10-09 20:00:00,6899,"It looks totally amazing and apparently can deliver up to 9KV for about a week at a time, that is more than enough to run an average house! As current requirements come down due to LEDs and things I can see our hydro rates going up. Less demand, less product, but those bonuses and salaries will still be there."

938854,G.mech,2015-10-09 21:54:00,830,I'm confused....the OP has a link to a Honda diesel car engine...what's the connection to electricity costs?
938861,adam lancia,2015-10-09 23:03:00,234,Generators is my guess.
938867,G.mech,2015-10-09 23:49:00,830,Generators is my guess.  It's a car engine...???...
938872,NANUK,2015-10-10 00:58:00,797,"The rumor has been circulating for a few years, its about time Honda brings diesel engine to North America. Designed by Honda, I am sure it will be unlike any diesel in this part of the world. The best part is competition and good for end consumer."
938876,adam lancia,2015-10-10 01:20:00,234,"I didn't read the article G.mech, I was making assumptions based off of Big Cliff's response."
938877,chris.brock,2015-10-10 01:24:00,4053," This isn't any new revelation, it's just Honda's response to VW's clean diesel smoke and mirrors."
938879,fish4me,2015-10-10 01:45:00,59,the article is from 2006...old news?
938881,Fisherman,2015-10-10 01:48:00,7201,"the article is from 2006...old news? Yup, just like Mazda and Subaru were going to bring diesels,  still waiting."
938882,John Bacon,2015-10-10 01:50:00,3277,"the article is from 2006...old news?  Any dibs on what will come first?  Honda diesel, or Leafs cup?"
938884,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-10 01:53:00,10439,A little fresher info. Review of the 2014 CRV diesel in Austrailia.  http://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/2014-honda-cr-v-diesel-review-video-27679  And the 2015 version in the UK.  http://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/honda/cr-v
938885,chris.brock,2015-10-10 01:57:00,4053,"oh yeah, good eye grt8fish  Hey Honda, where's all your NA diesels? Hahahaha"
938887,Fisherman,2015-10-10 01:58:00,7201,"Probably won't make it to N/A.  I've seen one Chev Cruze D since they came out, not impressed."
938899,Big Cliff,2015-10-10 09:52:00,6899,"Sorry guys, my bad. I had just finished reading an article on a new Honda generator then promptly got the information mixed in with this OP. Brain overload!"
938900,Fisherman,2015-10-10 11:19:00,7201,"Looks like MB, Mitsu, Mazda and Honda all pollute more than they say. https://www.facebook.com/topic/Auto-Emissions/109481375744144?source=whfrt&position=1&trqid=6203975480581842273"
938901,G.mech,2015-10-10 12:21:00,830,"Sorry guys, my bad. I had just finished reading an article on a new Honda generator then promptly got the information mixed in with this OP. Brain overload!  No worries Cliff, I have been having 'moments' myself lately and I really thought maybe it was me again....not this time I guess but I'm sure it won't be long!"
938911,Pigeontroller,2015-10-10 14:14:00,2793,"Yup, old stuff....Drives me nuts when people post 'news' without checking the date!"
938917,SmokestackLightnin,2015-10-10 15:32:00,390,"I like the article, it says within 3 years.  It was written around the time Isuzu was going to trade 4 cylinder diesels for Honda V6 engines.  Then Toyota bought part of Isuzu and squashed the deal and start developing a 4-cylinder diesel.  One of the issues back in 2006 with Honda was their dealer network and the lack of trained technicians and diagnostic equipment.  If you notice the article says Honda in the US which has a massive training budget when compared to Honda Canada."
939195,BillM,2015-10-12 14:53:00,17367,"Honda couldn't meet emissions, they won't be offering a diesel here anytime soon.   I've got pics of the Accord wagon diesel test car"
