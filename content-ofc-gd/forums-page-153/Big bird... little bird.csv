938934,Fisherman,2015-10-10 19:58:00,7201,"Nice, the big bird was good today, I feel plump after all the potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, carrots onions and turkey.  Then came the Mocca cream cake,  I'm sure my blood sugar took a little spike."
938935,Rodbender,2015-10-10 20:11:00,1027,I'll take the little one over the big one anyday Nice to see your getting a few

Then came the Mocca cream cake,  I'm sure my blood sugar took a little spike. We always do ours as an evening thing, I like the idea of a late lunch, but with kids hockey and family tradition I'm not sure if I could change it.  I'll take the little one over the big one anyday Nice to see your getting a few  Crappy camera phone but it did come out well, if a little hot on the left."

939014,manitoubass2,2015-10-11 02:25:00,11391,Nah man dont
939021,Reel Man,2015-10-11 06:05:00,80,"Lol, I just did.  Definitely a new definition, unrelated to Fisherman's comment...or at least I hope so!!!"
939023,limeyangler,2015-10-11 11:28:00,5204,Nice bird mate!
939024,Fisherman,2015-10-11 11:38:00,7201,"Oh my, that was not what I meant.  Overstuffed, sort of like a beachball having difficulty moving with any grace.  Sorry if I offended anyone."
939028,kickingfrog,2015-10-11 13:23:00,8333,"I still haven't looked it up, maybe I'll use someone else's computer."
