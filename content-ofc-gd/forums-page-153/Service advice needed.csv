I have the knob but the stem broke off at the unit. Are these parts available, or would it be better to send it in for repairs?"

939197,OhioFisherman,2015-10-12 15:07:00,6623,"http://www.bwmarineproducts.com/baydist.htm  There is a link to their website.  Years ago I had the screen on one of my Hummingbirds develop a bunch of small cracks making it hard to see. The cost of replacing the screen was like half the cost of the depth finder, I might call for a rough estimate price first?  Mine was an older model that I bought with my boat, it seemed better to get a newer model to me for the costs involved. I did deal directly with Hummingbird though, maybe that place has better pricing?"
