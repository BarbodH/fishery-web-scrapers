940043,i2cool2fool,2015-10-17 01:14:00,349,Congrats and good luck Rick.
940059,xxgoaler,2015-10-17 02:28:00,106,Your kids are only that age once.  It's time you will never get back. Something else will come along that you can still spend plenty of time with them.  Good Luck
939598,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 15:33:00,11391,Yeah thats what my wife though as well???  Dirty HR tactics.  Still undecided really but lotsa good posts here to help me ponder it over?
939599,BillM,2015-10-14 15:35:00,17367,The older I get the more home time and personal time are important to me.  If I was 20-25 I'd do pretty much whatever I could to earn top dollar.  Now?  Not so much.
939602,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 15:41:00,11391," From 18 to 27 or 28 I chased the dollar, chased overtime like tou wouldnt believe, but I was smart about it.  I basically bought nothing and invested.  My dad told me one thing that always stuck in my head, ""if you cant pay for it in cash with one weeks pay, you cant afford it"".  Now the obvious exceptions are house and vehicle  If you read through the thread however, im not chasing money, im trying to work longer.  The company im at now can pull out of this mine at anytime.  The offering company is there at least a few years  And the mine is a 25 min drive from home so I dont need to stay in camp for either job?"
939603,misfish,2015-10-14 15:43:00,29133,What Bill said. Im the same.  Best of luck with what ever you decide Rick.
939625,Steelheadphycho,2015-10-14 17:31:00,470,"I hate having to make decisions like that!!  Now that you mention that the mine is as close as it is to home, and the shift start/end times aren't too crazy ( like 5a/5p would be awesome) then you may not miss out on too much family.  Consider this. If the mine doesn't allow you to have your phone on you or it doesn't allow you to spend any time on the Internet, then you will have less time on OFC. AND THATS BULL!!!  Naw man, I think for a guy who will have 7 kids soon, it's a tough call. The things I like are the security of knowing you have a job for the next few years or more. Great $$$/Benny's are a plus. And if all your income is for your kids future then.........  I'd do it!  Best of luck Rick!"
939629,jimmer,2015-10-14 17:59:00,2730,"Your wife said it's your call, so include her in the decision. You are a team and both will have important input on making the right decision for your family. I know personally, money isn't everything. Time to spend with family (you have a lot) or enjoy my hobbies weighs out over money every time. You have to be able to pay the bills though."
939636,Sterling,2015-10-14 18:20:00,477,"Job security is everything. Sure 14 hour shifts might suck, but so does being unemployed. That contract can end any second really, I'd definitely take it up with your current employer and try to secure long-term employment with benefits.  I did 4 weeks on, 2 off, 14 hour shifts for almost 2 years, the hardest part was not having anyone with whom to have conversations. All the guys I worked with were duds.  Careful with gold mines though, lots of them are shutting down. What property would you be working at? Also that job doesn't sound like engineering at all, are they misleading you?"
939643,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 18:42:00,11391,"I can still post on OFC lol. Only from my truck during my downtime.  Once im outta the truck no cell phones and never any pictures.  Some of the labourers hate our jobs because we basically sit and watch them work. Ill admit it feels bad.  Same as when i was in a safety consultant in the oilfields.  So I just get out and chat with them, bust some jokes, grab em waters etc. Thats all im permitted to do.  And its not necessarily engineering im doing. Its surveying for engineering companies. Im no engineer thats for certain lol"
939644,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 18:42:00,11391,This mine is just opening. Its not operational as of yet

939650,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 19:42:00,11391,"If ya read the whole thread, its basically boiled down to this  Company 1 less pay and contract work/no stability. Full benefits 5 on 2 off schechule  Company 2 $6/raise, 2 hours paid travel time(even though its the same site 25 mins away) more stability and 6 on 3 off schedule, full benefits"
939651,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 19:45:00,11391,Company 1 overtime after 44(no working days off)  Company 2 overtime after 55(work any unscheduled shift ya want)  Wifey stayed home today so we could look at all options.  Im taking the new job.  Thank you all for your input?  This place rocks!
939657,aplumma,2015-10-14 20:48:00,6896,Good decision I decided to let you work through the issues and decide it among the people who it effects. your family.   Art

I'll have to dig out the receipt haha. but it was kinda guy heaven for stuff  (for that lonely stretch of highway that is...) looked at a pair Husqy chainsaw boots lol if I wasn't making miles, I would hung out a bit more dropping more coin."

Take the money is what I always said and you did, but after what is happening now with my pension I'm not so sure. Yea take the money."
939898,manitoubass2,2015-10-16 01:34:00,11391,And straight to night shifts lol.
939948,Sterling,2015-10-16 15:55:00,477,"And straight to night shifts lol.  I don't mind NS, it's quieter and the safety man is less likely to bug you (but work safe anyway please).  Only thing I found weird was eating dinner in the ""morning"" and breakfast at ""night""."
939949,manitoubass2,2015-10-16 16:00:00,11391,I actually love nights! I might only sleep for 4 hours but at least i can get other stuff done.  Plus they gave me the weekend off to acclimate?  Working in the bush at night should be fun! Lotsa reports of bears and wolves in the area at night
939480,davey buoy,2015-10-13 20:46:00,5505,"well the current company hasn't done what they offered so keep that in mind. learning new skills is NEVER a bad thing and a good way to future proof yourself. The only thing that you need to decide is the hours cuz those are long days. I have a feeling you're leaning to the new place but whatever is best for your family is what it will come down to. good luck Agreed 100%,look after yourself as we both have mentioned.Easy now isn't it?.  ."
939484,bigcreekdad,2015-10-13 21:00:00,546,"Many years ago, I got an offer from a bank. I was at a competitive bank at the time. Both good jobs, but pay was a bit better at the offering bank. The potential new job was a bit different and I thought it would be nice to add to the resume, and it offered a bit more variety. However, the job I had was not overly difficult, had great coworkers, and I was (I think) appreciated by senior management. And, if I stuck around, I was the likely next CFO.  Absolutely drove me nuts trying to decide. Ended up talking to my brother about it. After listening, he said ""why not""? I couldn't really respond, and ended up making the move. In hindsight, I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  Good luck....you have a nice problem."
939493,moxie,2015-10-13 22:45:00,1566,Family time is important but we do have a shelf life when it comes to work. You mentioned your wife said it was your call but have you sat down and had a chat with the kids?
939498,mr blizzard,2015-10-13 23:14:00,1589,"Rick not to take away from this thread at all but in fairness dave the p1 and 2 are keeping some very qualified people out of the mines just saying. qualified at heavy equipment and policing but because a person is p3 its gutter ball material up here, yes the mines are great but u have to get through the territorial politics first, sorry Rick for posting, u have been given some great advice and u know our family thoughts are with you"
939501,manitoubass2,2015-10-13 23:39:00,11391,Well decisions decisions lol.  Thanks for all the input  Family meeting time
939502,manitoubass2,2015-10-13 23:42:00,11391,About to get their input after hockey.  I never make these choices solely on my own.
939503,Rizzo,2015-10-14 00:10:00,4754,"That's career suicide! Especially if you are contract. MB2 - do what's right for the family. Money is one thing, family time is another. You will do the right thing. HH I would disagree with that (the career suicide part). When I was on a one year contract I also was given an offer elsewhere. I asked the boss to have a chat, told him quite openly what I had been offered and that because of the full time nature at that other job I was going to have to take it. My boss didn't want to lose me, offered me full time right on the spot with better pay and benefits. If you are a valuable employee they will want to keep you. Mind you, I busted my butt at that job...there was no spending time on OFC while I was at work! Every available second I was working, skipping lunches, staying late, arriving early etc. If you want to stay at your current company, give them a chance to at least try and keep you. If you don't even want to be there just take the other job. Personally, I did not want to blindside my employer and just take the other job. I was honest with them, they were honest with me. I ended up staying there 10 more years and only left because I was offered a General Manager position elsewhere"
939507,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 00:30:00,11391," I did my job and still do to a T.  I cant work until piles are in are roads need work. Im on others work time  During my time with this company ive always been the first one there and the last to leave.  Nature of my position doing data entry. Cant do it till all work for the day is done.(esentially I do the work of two people, and 3 at times)  So it sounds lazy lol. But there is literally nothing I can do when I am caught up, and then my work begins again when the boys go home.  My boss is pretty good. Ive never been one to blindside my employer so he was the first to know.  And to your point, he was making calls to the owner asap to see what could be done.  Again the huge downside is the company I now work for cannot offer me security unless I accept work after this project in thunder bay, 4 hours away.  New company offers security but rediculous hours. But ....  Ughhh  I hear yas its a nice problem to have, im very thankful. But its a tough decision.  If the schedule was different id jump at it ie, 21 on 12 off or something similar"
939508,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 00:35:00,11391,6 on 3 off sucks at 14 hour days imo  First day is sleep/recovery  Day two is the day to catch up on everything  Day three is prepare to go back to work lol

939519,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 01:26:00,11391,The mines here give preference to aboriginals. They have deals in place for hiring quotas.

939528,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 02:18:00,11391,"Thats ""kinda good"" lol.  Ours is susposed to employ 850 but ive mined before I know thats a lowball number. Id guess at least 1200"
939530,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 02:21:00,11391,"I hate the fact we rape the earth but if I dont take the spot someone else will.  So ill be the first to say im a hypocrite.  And at the same time I love seeing all my brothers and sisters with really good sustainable jobs.  One thing about mining, you will learn new skills everyday. And if your not a dog_______ you will be given every opportunity to move up"
939535,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-14 03:08:00,8243,Sorry guys I didn't bother to read the responses because I don't think this is a question no one else but Rick can answer himself. The only person he should take advice from on a decision like this is his wife.
939536,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 03:10:00,11391," Lol  My wife isnt perfect either, she has a cozy desk job????.  And OI, remember i consulted you when I started my current position for thoughts?  Its just good IMO to get some outside thoughts in case im over/under looking things  Like the tax post that was news to me!"
939539,manitoubass2,2015-10-14 03:22:00,11391,"Also new to me. I was told OT doesnt start until 55 hours because its considered""road work"" at least at this point.  Maybe laws have changed? Or havent???  Last i knew it was anything over 44 hours, anything on weekends, any unscheduled time, and 4 hours for any call in  Any insight here?   I have the labour laws book bit its tucked away in a box somewhere lol."
939540,John Bacon,2015-10-14 03:39:00,3277,"Normally in Ontario the employer has to pay overtime after 44 hours.  I don't think weekends matter.  There may be exceptions to the 44 hour rule; plus, I think they can average it over three weeks."

939551,Big Cliff,2015-10-14 10:04:00,6899,"The one thing that has come up in several of the replies is job security. While I think it is important I don't think it is something to count too much on.  My son did something similar to what you are considering; First company closed down operations after just over a year. It didn't take him long, he's a hard worker, he had another job within a few days, their contract ran out about 6 months after he started and didn't get renewed. No problem, he has a good skill set and easily got another job, three months later site shut down for maintainance for a month, that was 6 weeks ago.  He has finally decided that he has had enough of camp life and has now taken a job an hour from home, it's a lot less money but he gets a lot more family time.  Whatever you decide good luck with it and remember you can always change your mind if you decide you don't like it."

939435,manitoubass2,2015-10-13 18:17:00,11391,"Im currently pretty cozy at my job. Great company and pretty easy work. In fact I post here from work all the time lol cause on a 12 hour shift Im usually sitting in a work truck for 6 hours. Pay is good, $23/hour, 10 hour days and weekends off.  I get an offer today from another engineering company at the gold mine. $29 and hour, 6 on three off at 14 hour days.  Big time overtime cheques, and longterm work.  My current job is contract. I might be done in a month or 6 months, I have no clue?  Im trying to way the pros and cons here if yall could add in some thoughts it would be appreciated?  Wife says its your call.  What I dont like is the fact I basically wont see the wife or kids. Ill miss my sons hockey, fishing, hunting, and most importantly family.  I got 3 days to decide.  What would you do?"
939436,porkpie,2015-10-13 18:31:00,2521,"Depends on how financially stable you are.  Only you can answer that.  The other question is, do you have to go down the hole at the new job?  Time off is a major factor for any type of employment.  I work long hours when I'm on, but I have lots of time off.  Me, I'm in a very stable job and I enjoy that security. It also allows for long term planning, however if I didn't see my family much, that would severely impact my opinion of my employment.  Good luck."

939447,Headhunter,2015-10-13 19:26:00,5703,"  depends how long hes been contracting with that company, and what the employer is like No, it doesn't. He is a contract employee which is essentially ""term"" employment. The employer will view him as potentially cutting his term short, even if he doesn't accept the other offer. They will look for another ""term"" employee that they feel they can rely on to fullfill the obligations of the term. An employee who puts an employer in a position of concern, is usually a soon to be ex-employee. Also, should MB2 complete the terms of his current obligation, the employer could also look to another resource, that hasn't indicated that they might not fullfill their obligation. You should really look at this only from the point of view of the employer.... what employees think has little to nothing to do with these kind of decisions. HH"
939448,leaf4,2015-10-13 19:28:00,2466,"I would at least give it a shot, job stability is something to be had these days. If I could find a job like that right now I would take it in a heartbeat personally but our paths in life are vastly different to say the least haha. Even then I wouldn't want to do those long hours for more than a few years, I've been there doing 14+ hour days up to 90 hours in a week, and I felt like a zombie come week three, but I only had Sunday off, not 3 days which would be awesome, with that overtime (do they pay after 40 or 44?) You would be easily over 100k"

Everything you save is essentially knocked off your taxable income, plus that could mean earlier retirement. It's hard for me to say though, I don't have kids so it's easier for me to work more."
939450,bare foot wader,2015-10-13 19:29:00,1354,"You've listed only wages and hours, but what other benefits? Not just medical and dental, rrsp? employee stock matching? training and development? advancement opportunity?  I would assume the mining company offers better benefits than your current temp contract position, but that's merely a strangers assumption here  I've been employed in the mining industry for the past 6 years, currently at a gold copper mine, I may be slightly biased but I'd say the mining gig is the better long term choice...but I'm not raising a family either, but there are lots of people that do and seem to be happy where I work."
939451,manitoubass2,2015-10-13 19:33:00,11391,"Well just some insight.  When I started last year I was just a grunt. The owners son died in a diving accident and I was quickly trained in to fill that position.  Within 3 days I basically ran the show.  BUT, after the job was up I was promised full time work(and that never happened)  They didnt call me back for 7 months until they got a contract at the mine. Bit of a slap in the face.  BUT, the company is great(when your working)  Im about a 20 minute drive from work, and its just in developmental stages.  Id be switching from sampling to road gauging etc.  This new company wants me pretty bad lol. Im not too sure how or why?  I like the fact its very long term work.  I like the pay offer  I dislike the schedule and hours  I worked many 14-16 hour days in the oilfield, its not that I cant handle it.  BUT in the oilfield you really worked.  In surveying/engineering of a mine, its truly boring. Lotsa sitting around watching the loaders and dozers.  Do I need the money? Not really, im set up well on my weyerhaueser shares.  It certainly doesnt hurt though  Fact is I really like to work."

939455,Dara,2015-10-13 19:40:00,3052,"If he was hired as contract. He's just that, a contract/temporary employee. Any employer would tell him to walk.... I see it all the time where I am.  Take a piece of paper, write pro on one side con on the other. Make a list.....  Also, look at the tax bracket change...... Sometime taking more $$$ means less take home  G   No it doesn't. It means you pay a higher percentage on the additional money, not on all of it"
939457,John Bacon,2015-10-13 19:45:00,3277,"Also, look at the tax bracket change...... Sometime taking more $$$ means less take home    No, that is not true.  You cannot end up with less after tax income due to an increase in before tax income.  If you move into a higher tax bracket, only the income that is over and above the limit is taxed at a higher rate.  E.g. if the tax bracket changes at $50,000 and you are earning $51,000; you will pay a higher tax rate on the $1,000; not on the entire $51,000.     "
939460,manitoubass2,2015-10-13 19:57:00,11391, One year I owed $2000 roughly  But most years I either break even or get a good return  My memory is not that great but out west I actually got I believe arond $7200 in return(i think some of that was northern living allowance)  Those years I made crazy money  Im not too worried about taxes. My main goal is to live comfortably and set our kids up nicely
939462,manitoubass2,2015-10-13 20:01:00,11391,Good info i was unaware of?
939464,manitoubass2,2015-10-13 20:05:00,11391,"Im really looking at this for security.  I hate EI and at 35 ive only been on it twice.  Im a savage at saving money. I do buy what I need, but thats hardly ever(ie i bought a camper this spring)  We also get a hefty child tax benefit and the kids use that for what they need, the rest goes into savings."
939469,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-13 20:10:00,10439,"Out here the mines are one of the biggest employers. They pay very well and treat their employees like gold. Excellent compensation for working on site, health and retirement plans etc. Most in camp positions are 2 weeks in 2 weeks out. 7 days a week/12 hours a day. Of course you get a 2 week vacation every month which isn't that bad. Lots of families here with a parent working 2 in 2 out in the mines."
939470,davey buoy,2015-10-13 20:14:00,5505,"Make a decision Rick,almost everyone I made with my heart worked well,often led to another door opening.More experience,better pay I always say.Looks like where you are,could be repeat again with very little security.Don't wait to long!"
939471,chris.brock,2015-10-13 20:14:00,4053," 6 days in a row, 14 hour days, no thanks, I wouldn't like that.  Good luck with your choice Rick, it's nice to have options."
939474,crappieperchhunter,2015-10-13 20:33:00,2582,"$29 and hour, 6 on three off at 14 hour days.   30 years ago I would have been all over that....but I wouldn't be looking at anything with those kind of hours now."
939475,Acountdeleted,2015-10-13 20:38:00,2562,"A few years ago I moved out to Edmonton to take a job with a big consulting firm. Big salary, tons of overtime and lots of chance to move up in the company. I hated it. I was a 4 hour flight away from my nearest family, worked long days out in the field where I didn't even get to go home to my own bed and I felt like I was wasting my life away.  Money will come and money will go. Don't miss the moments that you will remember until the da you leave this earth. Family comes first."
939476,woodenboater,2015-10-13 20:40:00,2277,well the current company hasn't done what they offered so keep that in mind. learning new skills is NEVER a bad thing and a good way to future proof yourself. The only thing that you need to decide is the hours cuz those are long days. I have a feeling you're leaning to the new place but whatever is best for your family is what it will come down to. good luck
