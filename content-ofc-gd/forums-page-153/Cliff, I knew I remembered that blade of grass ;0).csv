939205,misfish,2015-10-12 16:07:00,29133,Fishing lots of different areas these past few or so weeks. I havent even thought of taken pictures as I would just get them in and release quickly. This one I kept for a feed.  Back ground look familier Cliff ?      
939211,ccmtcanada,2015-10-12 16:24:00,7971,Great.  That spot is blown now!!!  Went out again this morning....still no steel or Browns....just pain in the #%! Chinooks!  Nice  fish Brian....I'm jealous. Lol

939280,chris.brock,2015-10-12 23:38:00,4053, I think your spot is safe but feel free to PM it me Bri.  Nice avatar too.
939281,SirCranksalot,2015-10-12 23:47:00,3291,What a coincidence!! I usually fish about 100m downstream from there!!!
939282,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-12 23:55:00,10439,I got this nice one in that spot!!!
