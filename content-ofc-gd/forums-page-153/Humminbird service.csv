Take it to Sail and they don't have a clue - call a guy over from fishing - no clue.  The clerk in Returns says call Johnson in Burlington as they do servicing.  Call Johnson and the say call Bay Distrubutors in North Bay.  North Bay!!  1-800 number , alright!!  Finally talk to a George at Bay Distributors and he seems to know what to do.  Says you ship it up, we fix it and we send it back.  Sure enough, 2 weeks later it arrives via courier re-packed in the empty water bottles I used to pack it with.  Good as new!!  Long story short - got the service and product knowledge I expected from Sail.  Good thing Humminbrird has a company like Bay Distributors lookin' after their service.  Walleye Guy  "
