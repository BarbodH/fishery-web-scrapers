939070,Hank Jr,2015-10-11 19:40:00,146,"My son and I fished Balsam and Sturgeon 3 days each this week for Muskies . We boated 3 Muskies and 6 Pike on Balsam and 7 Muskies on Sturgeon we had a bunch of follows , hits and several hooked lost fish . Wednesday is the only day we didn't boat a fish we fished hard 8 or 9 hours and only had 1 follow . I had a triple bypass the end of May and wasn't sure how this trip was going to go . I was tired and sore by the end of the week but it was worth it . Here are a couple of my sons fish . "

939073,Rich Clemens,2015-10-11 19:48:00,3131,Sweet.  NIce going guys.   Good to hear you had some action.   Much better than my two trips up north this year.
939077,misfish,2015-10-11 20:02:00,29133,"  Im glad to read a report after that Hank. Im sure your son will never forget that trip, nor will you.  That tiger is sweet looking."
939088,kitch,2015-10-11 21:48:00,42,"Good to read that after the heart issues you got out fishing and had success.  Just being on the water is the best therapy, a fish in the boat just speeds the healing!  That tiger is a pretty fish for sure.  I fished Wednesday too and had nothing in the boat, must have been the weather."

Nice fish anyways.  spent over 18 hours on upper buckhorn this year without a follow either.  Went to pigeon and got skis.  Nice tiger, i need to get one in my life time. Kind of a bucket list fish."
