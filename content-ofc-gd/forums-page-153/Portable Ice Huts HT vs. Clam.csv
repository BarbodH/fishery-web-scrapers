939861,manitoubass2,2015-10-15 20:47:00,11391,I agree. HT is just generic crap  Spend the extra money and buy somethimg reliable.  Ive never seen an HT product that wasnt just a price point piece of crap
939871,mike rousseau,2015-10-15 22:06:00,4661,My fishing partner had an HT  1-2 seasons and the poles exploded... It wasn't even that cold that day  I got an insulated Eskimo and absolutely love it
939875,misfish,2015-10-15 22:45:00,29133,"You are lucky then, everything I have ever bought from HT has fallen apart, the zips and the material on the ice fishing bags go….the cork on their rods falls off, the handles on their ice scoops break…or just fall apart…their reels on the combos are junk and seize up as soon as its below zero…lol…I'm not a fan!  My first was a Polar escape flip. It was awesome. Great material.  Bought my second one off Wayne which he got off my brother. If it wasnt for the moles eating up the tarp, I would still probly have it. The tri pod seats are crap. Lasted me one season. The boggan was solid as well. Have since gone with the eski 2 man hub. It,s not 2 man thats for sure. Broke a pole due to my own fault. Other then that, it does the job. Sets up in the wind no prob. Just need to know how to. Have another hub that was given to me, it,s a 4 man. Great fabric and sets up in the wind like the same as eski. Just need to know how like said before.  So set up in the wind. Screw in anchor. Tie off the wall that is the back side of the door. Once done, pop pop pop pop. Secure the rest and bank the  flaps. Good to go. I have been out on some days the wind would flip over a flip over. Yes it happened.  Im not saying one is better then the other, you get what you pay for and you get what mother nature deals you."
939957,Joeytier,2015-10-16 16:28:00,3990,"HT is junk.  You're not saving money if its useless after one or two seasons.  I just bought a few year old Clam Twin Hub II for 100 bucks, and I bet it would outlast any brand new HT hut off the shelf.  Clearly a high quality product, even more so than the Eskimos, which are also a good hut."
939978,LeXXington,2015-10-16 19:03:00,1928,Go for the thermal pop-up. So much warmer
940004,misfish,2015-10-16 21:41:00,29133,"Before all these new shelters, I made a few of those plywood and tarp portable huts. Probly cost 1/3 or less to make and still roomy and warm to fish out of with a coleman heater.   http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/tips/post/building-a-collapsible-ice-hut    "
422501,archie_james_c,2010-01-15 03:41:00,618,"Me and a buddy are looking at going halves on a portable ice hut we were looking at the following...  Clam Summit 6'X8' 78"" center height. 30lbs...249$ USD on Cabela's.  HT Insta Shak 92""X92"" with an 84"" center. 249$ CDN 22lb weight on Lebaron.ca  Is something too good to be true here with the HT? Bigger, lighter AND cheaper?  Anyone who has seen these beasts up close and can compare material for me feel free to chime in!"
422506,bigugli,2010-01-15 04:01:00,6138,"After having owned an HT flip shelter, I would not reccomend their product. Thinner grade canvas, poor stitching and soft hinges mean a lot of repairs. I'm on my third season with the HT 2 man and I have spent a lot of time restitching seams and replacing pins every season.  I would go for the Clam"
422537,vinnimon,2010-01-15 10:29:00,2593,I had my clam for 5 seasons or so.No issues so far.Seams are holding fine even the windows havent cracked yet.
422538,FISHINGNUT,2010-01-15 10:43:00,253,"I have a Clam 6800 about 5 seasons old  I have zero isssues with it other than the mice chewing it up this fall  Heavy canvas ,cross beams ,stiching ,zippers all top quality I think Clam is a better built product than HT (IMO)"
422608,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-15 16:29:00,0,"HT's stuff has not impressed me as of yet.  It was an HT ice rod I returned last week. The clam has been around a while, and has an excellent reputation seemingly, both on the board and on the ice."
422634,anders,2010-01-15 17:46:00,1168,"i think you should by the hut yourself, and dont try to go half with another person.  THere is always a good chance of each other tryin to take it one weekned somewhere, when the other wants to take it another spot.  MY .02 is buy it yourself, and save the hassles down the road."
422662,TDunn,2010-01-15 18:30:00,680,I have a clam nanook and its great. No complaints at all.....I wouldnt split a shack with someone either as Anders has pointed out... check out riverside outdoors in thunder bay...Shipping isnt to bad to the sault....He uses the greyhound bus... As far as HT goes I use a few HT rods and I love em too.....   TDunn
422700,canadadude,2010-01-15 20:57:00,769,"Stay away from HT products absolutly no quality, there built to break.....I've had bad luck with everything they make except for the HT blue fiberglass ice rod, a great perch tool"
422748,vinnimon,2010-01-15 23:19:00,2593,"Whatever you decide on, dont split on a hut/boat etc.Ive been there and seen many others in the same situation.It will go down hill for sure.You may loose a good friend and fishing buddy over a measly 2 bits worth.Its not worth it at all!I lost a good long time friend over something in the same manner.If you cant afford a hut then buy 2 cheap pop up tents, then go from there.No quarrels and you are both sheltered.AND STILL BUDS.just my 2 cnts worth."
422756,archie_james_c,2010-01-15 23:37:00,618,You guys make a good point about sharing anything. I usually stay well away from this. But I figured it would work since the only person he ever fishes with is me. But you all make a good point. I suppose I've gone without a hut for this long already...why not a little longer   .
422757,vinnimon,2010-01-15 23:47:00,2593,"A cheapo kids tent and some matting, that shouldnt create a problem at all.Buy two.I did when I wanted shelter.Then no issues and you both have a back up.Just in case.FYI Those tents will fly across the lake like a parachute.So will the clam but not as bad.HEHE"
424955,grt1,2010-01-22 23:17:00,638,"I just got home from a trip to Winnipeg. I went looking for ice shelters and at Cabelas they had an Eskimo Quickfish2 (2 person size, i guess) for $229 but you couldn't stand up in it. They had a HT shelter that was bigger but it was $279 and looked like it was more cheaply made. I remember readiing the comments on here before I went looking and I can see where those comments are coming from.  Then I went to COSTCO. they had an Eskimo Quickfish 3 on for $179 and you could stand up in it. they say it is 90x90 and a 78"" hieight.  I don't ice fish that much, but for that money, who could pass it up. I'm sure momma is going to love me for bringing it home. LOL"

939765,joeybacala,2015-10-15 03:16:00,63,"Seems that the board is really not to impressed with the HT. I had/have an opportunity to purchase one and just from the opinions so far it really has me second guessing. The one thing I would love to know,( if anyone knows) I really cant find a subzero hut. Everyone I talk to say that CT sells them. Also is the material fabric on the HT the same as the subzero? Really would like to hear from anyone who knows the differences."
939771,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-15 03:37:00,10439,"I have a Sub Zero pop up shelter I use early in the season. The fabric is much better than the HT crap. Had an HT for one weekend before I returned it broken.  Doesn't matter what you buy, they all frost up big time @ -40!!!!    "

939824,BillM,2015-10-15 16:52:00,17367,Clam for me.
939830,DanD,2015-10-15 17:36:00,2223,"On a calm sunny day, with temperatures around -10° to -15° most any portable will be fine. It's when there's a strong wind and cold temps, is where the lower quality of some of these huts will let you down. Last year setting up my 6 man Rapala Pro on a windy day, I was quit surprised and happy it stayed intact. There were 3 of us there; one being my niece that weighs maybe 100lbs. I told her whatever you do don't let go of the hut; not until I get it staked down. I set the first 2 pegs and all of a sudden a big gust of wind grabs the hut and the base is like 5 feet in the air; with some of the walls collapsed in. I think you little bugger (my niece) you let go. I look up and she hadn't; but her feet were at least 3 feet off the ground, dangling in the wind. We laughed so hard that we all let go and the hut tumbled to the end of the 2 tether straps in a tangled mess of poles, canvas and tether straps. We finally did get set up and there wasn't any broken poles or rips; so I was happy and still laughing at my flying niece.  Not the same day but one taken a week or so later.   Dan."

939853,AKRISONER,2015-10-15 20:30:00,5558,"my main fishing partner has an HT...never mind the seams and crappy tabs, the entire walls seem to just randomly degrade so that more and more pin holes and runs just randomly appear everywhere.  Yes it will do the trick in a pinch...sort of? but expect your hut to be cold.  Pops and I have fished in our clam many times and the thing is usually toasty without a heater...they are very nice and airtight and great at keeping your body heat in once it gets going..the HT in general isn't that pleasant to fish in once it gets below -15"
