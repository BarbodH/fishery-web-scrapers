938602,super dave,2015-10-07 19:42:00,323,"i have a jackson big tuna.  its a big heavy beast but super stable.   its great to have to option to have two (i've even had my wife and two kids) or solo position.  it has two elevated seating postions for both riders, integrated live well and bunch of other features.   check out the jackson site.  it's a PITA to load off and on solo but i devised a kayak load assist made out of 2x4s so its manageable.  in the process of installing a trolling motor with foot pedal control.  Cant wait to try that out.  I've heard good things about the Nucanoe and i just saw that Sail now carries them for $1000.   it also has two seater option and motor mount ready.  i would consider that if i was in the market for one."
938721,misfish,2015-10-08 17:59:00,29133,"Feel frees are not light. That was the model I was looking at as well, then I too ,went with the pontoon.  I"
938722,leaf4,2015-10-08 18:05:00,2466,"I was looking at the 11.5, I think it weighs 74lbs, so 36 less than my canoe and 4 1/2 feet shorter I could handle it better I think and there's no metal rails like my canoe has which is my main concern around my vehicle  Everyone should watch this video lol  https://youtu.be/FHOw2cvMx88"
938746,Steve,2015-10-08 22:14:00,2075,"so your going 4.5' shorter, and your losing the ability to put a real motor on the craft? and it's an upgrade?  most folks tend to go bigger, with bigger motors, on an upgrade....  yakkers are interesting folk  :)  but for exercise, certainly nothing beats a kayak!"
938748,leaf4,2015-10-08 22:27:00,2466,"Haha, I definitely will be getting a boat, but that's a couple years away realistically. Working on getting another rental property and then I'll be looking at a house that can hold a boat, so in the meantime I can wait and head out in the father in laws 18.5 with him"
938765,porkpie,2015-10-08 23:43:00,2521,"I love my nucanoe, but it is boat number 3 In the fleet.  If it where my main rig, I'd stay with the scanoe.  They're a great boat!"
938794,Shloim,2015-10-09 03:02:00,515,"Like I said before I had both a great canoe and yak. If I were to get a solo boat  again it would be the Old Town Next.its the perfect solo boat IMO. For me weight while solo loadind and unloading is key and if you care to it allows you to carry it to some back woods spots too. Standing is nice but not really easy and without risk in a kayak,a 100 lb + boat is a  whine to load and unload unless you have help and impossible to portage...."
938796,leaf4,2015-10-09 03:19:00,2466,So... Now that I've found people who like the scanoe when does the bidding war begin!  hahaha

938815,zeeter,2015-10-09 15:12:00,92,"I kayak the Grand River a lot with my Nucanoe Frontier 12. It is very stable for standing and there's more room by my feet than other kayaks which I like. It is not meant for portaging. The wheel attachment on the back is a must. If I were buying an individual kayak I would look into the Nucanoe Pursuit 14. Faster, but still very stable. Lots of room for mods."
939883,redwings24,2015-10-15 23:38:00,15,I plan to get a yak this winter during the sportsmen show or the boat show.  I saw one last year at the out door show for a grand all in.  Dame missed that chance.  Not this time.
939918,Shloim,2015-10-16 10:31:00,515,"I was at one of the shows last year, felt like I was paying to go to Bass Pro. However they had a kayak testing pool that you could try various kayaks out in and that was cool. there was a short line up when i walked by so yaks are getting alot of interest...  loved mine but sold it to help pay for another boat http://i1275.photobucket.com/albums/y444/Shloim1/20140419_121336_zps5fe2f492.jpg"
940328,singingdog,2015-10-18 12:02:00,1047,"If you want a great fishing yak, that is easy to load and portage/cart into back lakes, check out the Wilderness Systems Commander. It will handle a trolling motor (if you want to ruin a perfectly good yak  ), is easy to stand and fish in, and is quite a bit lighter than any SOT. It is NOT a Lake O boat: it doesn't self bail like a SOT will, and will take on water in big waves.  If you want the ultimate open-water boat, check out the ATAK: better speed than any other standable yak, and has all the open-water safety of a SOT."
938062,leaf4,2015-10-04 03:30:00,2466,"Seeing as I'm looking into getting rid of the square back canoe I'm currently using, and looking at kayaks I came across this beauty  http://predatorkayak.com/  I would love to have this, such a multi species vessel I'm not a fan of the price, but its warranted haha all I can say is wow!"

Jackson wins after that, lots of models at different price points. They're comfortable for a full day of fishing and are stable enough to stand in.

Cant wait to get it on the water under electric power  :)  I love it, it can be a tad heavy when launching solo  in tricky spots , but nothing unbearable. Its most notable plus is its stability and comfortable layout. I can stand and fish pretty darn easily.

938422,Nipfisher,2015-10-06 13:59:00,2449,"I have  a Kiwi ""Angler"" pontoon style kayak. It is cumbersome to launch and load in the truck but it is incredibly stable on the water. I don't have it rigged up yet but it does have a rod holder, storage pouch, molded transom and straps for battery. www.kiwikayak.com"
938502,porkpie,2015-10-07 00:17:00,2521,"I have a nucanoe frontier.  I had it loaded down the other day with 2 dozen duck decoys, a few geese, a trolling motor battery, trolling motor, camo for the boat, my milk crate full of extras like anchor, tool kit, safety gear etc, my hunting box with shot shells and calls etc, then my 240lb can in the boat.  It took me down the marsh at 3.5mph on GPS, was incredibly stable in that I can easily stand and paddle to set decoys, it hides like a dream and when ducks where shot I could use the kayak paddle to quickly nip out and get them.  It's great for fishing as well, and I can easily fish with me and one of my kids.  It's pretty much the ultimate kayak from where I sit and I'm loving it more every year. Sail carries them, there around a grand.  Something to consider."
938505,Steve,2015-10-07 00:34:00,2075,"curious.  i fished out of coleman scanoe for a number of years.  what can a kayak do, that the coleman scanoe could not?"
938509,leaf4,2015-10-07 00:48:00,2466," I also like the idea of trolling around inshore on lake o and Erie  Plus I've always loved kayaks, but I came across the scanoe at a really good deal so I couldn't pass it up haha"

938515,leaf4,2015-10-07 01:05:00,2466,"Yup, another reason why I like the old town predator, aside from speed, fully hands free I've been out in my canoe trying to set up in spots and trying to fish on the way having to reach behind etc"

938569,blaque,2015-10-07 14:33:00,2419,"As far as advantages of kayak over canoe............I agree, the major reason i left the whole canoe thing is i had a heck of a time getting a canoe on top of the truck and launching solo, then hoisting it back on top of the truck at the end of the day. Hated driving the interstate with that monster on the roof also. The kayak, i whip right in the bed flat and tie it down. Also, the fishing platform designed kayaks are just sooooo stable,,,,,,,,,youd be hard pressed to roll one over. And i also cant take on water on the sit on top kayak, scupper plugs allow for any water taken on to drain out.   And im also independant in the kayak when choosing where on the water to fish lol...........we all know that canoe partner that just doesnt know how to row, and never wants to fish the same water as you. No arguements on a kayak"
