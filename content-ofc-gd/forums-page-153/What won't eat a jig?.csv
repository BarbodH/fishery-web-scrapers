Much to my surprise just about everything will eat the jig/chunk!  I started of with a 24"" walleye and my daughter proceeded to show me up with not only the biggest smallmouth but a nice musky!!  She even managed a goby on the jig/chunk lol  here are a few pics...I got lots to be thankful for!!           "
