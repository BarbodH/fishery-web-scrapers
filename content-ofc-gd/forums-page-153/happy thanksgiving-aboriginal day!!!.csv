Went for a fish and caught a limit of walleyes...  Did a bird hunt and got 11 partridge and had a blast!  Then went to the father in laws for a wicked meal, not gonna lie, its always better when your not the chef???  Came home with two HUGE plates of leftovers and nothin but laughs and smiles all around!  Awesome few days for sure!!!!  And my bro in law just got a calf to end it all on a good note?  I hope you all had an awesome day with friends and family???  Prost????"

939276,chris.brock,2015-10-12 23:03:00,4053," Sounds like things are good, good to hear Rick.  A true story in the spirit of Thanksgiving. When I take off in a float plane I always get choked up. There's people who don't have food for themselves or their kids and I'm on a plane for the sole purpose of going fishing for a week. How am I so lucky?"
