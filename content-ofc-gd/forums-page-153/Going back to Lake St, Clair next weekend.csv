Cant wait, the weather so far looks great and while we will leave the musky fishing for others, the same guy that put us on to over 250 fish in 2.5 days (divided by 3) is coming and wants to target smallies on the main lake.....Any thoughts folks?

939925,Shloim,2015-10-16 12:09:00,515,"Now let's not forget I'm the rookie here . So for a couple of reasons, I'd rather be busy with bass than throw  massive lures all day long for hopefully 1 fish. We caught 250 fish there while we watched 50 guys get 5 fish in the same time period.  Secondly it's not my boat and we have the privaledge of fishing with a pro who won a big tourney this season. He's going for bass and we are following...."

939933,OhioFisherman,2015-10-16 13:22:00,6623,"If you don't have the right tackle for skis you are probably better off targeting other species? they might be too?    Came across that video a couple weeks ago, a younger guy from Ohio fishing there, looks like a good time."

940083,Shloim,2015-10-17 12:53:00,515,"Now don't get me wrong folks, Id love to catch a musky. Haven't caught one yet, but don't really have the proper gear so I'm hoping for a nice sized cooperative one I can land on my bass gear, It would  be kinda cool to blow some stuff up with a monster fish because I haven't done that either....just not my EVO."
