940589,craigdritchie,2015-10-19 22:24:00,1586,"Call Tom Goodfellow ( Goodfellow Handyman Services, 905-802-0598, http://tomgoodfellow.typepad.com/blog). Tom's in Burlington but he travels throughout the west GTA. He charges something like $350 a day - not exactly cheap - and he might be booked up for a couple of weeks when you call.  BUT ... there is a reason he is often booked up. Tom does first-class work, he's honest, he will treat your home with respect and not leave a mess after he's done, and he really does work his butt off - he doesn't slack off or decide he needs to go to Home Depot to get a part and bugger off for three hours.  I've had Tom do electrical and plumbing work, and I cannot recommend the man highly enough.  Cheers  Craig"
