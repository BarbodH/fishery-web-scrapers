939269,Sinker,2015-10-12 22:00:00,8692,"No, you dont need one."
939278,Kerry,2015-10-12 23:26:00,383,you don't need a trail pass but you do need the license sticker and insurance even if you are just using it on the lake. Kerry

939286,chris.brock,2015-10-13 00:21:00,4053, The moral of the story is to always have a tip-up and a spoon while sledding
939291,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-13 00:46:00,10439,$260!!! DAYUM!!! That's a lot of cake!!!
939364,AKRISONER,2015-10-13 13:13:00,5558,"$260!!! DAYUM!!! That's a lot of cake!!!  its actually a pretty darn good value if you take advantage of the what the trails have to offer. I.e. not use the trail to ride 2k and then go fishing.  My father and I spend countless hours riding the trails all over the province. The grooming and maintenance of the system is expensive, but riding highway like trails through the middle of the bush across ontario for 200 bucks is really a good value.  We also donate every year to our local clubs fundraiser as well."

939494,lakerguy,2015-10-13 22:52:00,224,2 early permits for my son and myself. I too thinks it a good price. Over 6000kms for both of us last season.

I ride trails out in loring all the time and they are 2 lanes wide and like a highway."
