939413,HTHM,2015-10-13 16:47:00,4082,I had my account set to another skin and am now back to the default skin. I cannot find where to change it back. Can anyone advise me?

It turns out that the ""Aplitex"" skin is not completely compatible. The one to use will be ""earthbound"" and of course the mobile skin if that's what you're using. We will be looking at new skins in the near future as a major board upgrade is in the works. I guess that's the price to pay to keep our software as current and secure as possible.  Thanks for understanding."
