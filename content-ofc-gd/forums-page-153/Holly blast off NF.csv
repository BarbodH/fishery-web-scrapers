940158,mattp33,2015-10-17 17:43:00,290,WOW Thats CRAZY!!!!  I loved the 1 that took off like a rocket!  And the VW peels out lol
940171,lew,2015-10-17 18:24:00,12766,Seen that one before Brian but it's worth another look for sure.  You can see the truck driver run away to the left just after the accident.

Yeah , the truck driver was probably the only one who knew what was coming, I like how the cop drove in and then backed out quickly when a missile came his way."

I seen this once in grande prarie with an unsecured load in a pick up(work truck) if I remember correctly it was a gas used for fracking. It was just one cylinder and it broke the tailgate at a stop and shot off like a rocket.  Thankfully nobody was hurt, but im sure the driver faced some wicked fines"
