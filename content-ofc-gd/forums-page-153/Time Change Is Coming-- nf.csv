How does it effect you and how do you cope with the changes?? If your job is on a schedule shift pattern, does that have change your hours of awareness?"

938536,adolson,2015-10-07 03:19:00,783,I hate time changes. We should leave the clocks just how they are right now.

939201,Beans,2015-10-12 15:14:00,3339,Already did it. I've been an hour late twice this week and it's only Tuesday.  I thought we change on Nov 1st...why not change just 1/2 hour back then leave alone after that...
939202,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-12 15:24:00,10439,Makes no difference to me. Makes it dark on the way into work. That's about it.
939203,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-12 15:26:00,8243,A discussion concerning this every year and if it's necessary. From what I remember we set the clock back so that little kids won't be walking to school in the dark back when kids were allowed to walk. It costs us money as more hydro across this land is used because of it getting darker earlier on the earth clock. I don't see any real reason to set the clock back in modern society.
939204,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-12 15:28:00,8243,"Yea I was thinking of you guys in the Arctic, unless you have a great watch you may never know what time it is."
939207,manitoubass2,2015-10-12 16:14:00,11391,When I worked in northern alberta there was set time  Dark Work Dark Eat Still dark Sleep
939208,manitoubass2,2015-10-12 16:16:00,11391,That being said time change is science.  I hope you all know why it exists?  You cant change it just like you cant change the hours in a day or the seconds in a minute etc
939217,misfish,2015-10-12 17:24:00,29133,"Ah the spring forward ,fall back time.  Was thinking of this post as I sat in darkness on the river bank waiting for enough light to see my float. I am an early bird when it comes to getting to my spots. I like to be the first one there, get the spot. I sat for an hour this morning gazing at the bright stars above enjoying my morning coffee. This time of the year makes me think maybe sleep in a bit, but thats not going to happen. During the summer months, I can be fishing at 5 am when the light has started and watch great sunrises.  If getting to my spot early and means I need to sit and wait and gaze upon the stars, Im good with that. I dont let it effect me in the least.  Come the ice fishing season, I like to get out and get set up before light.( when I know it,s safe out there) Again, sitting there in a warm hut having a coffee thinking of what the day will bring.  Then the spring forward comes. It all starts over again."
939231,Old Ironmaker,2015-10-12 18:20:00,8243,"I'm usually up at 4AM too. Because I haven't gone to bed yet. Night is the best part of the day. Phones don't ring, no traffic and no idle chat with neighbours walking their dogs. Night shift was my favorite shift. I didn't have my boss(s) calling on the radio every 3 minutes and generally the crew was too tired to bust my balls. Nights are nice and quiet."
