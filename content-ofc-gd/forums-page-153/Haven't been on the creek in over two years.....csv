938601,ccmtcanada,2015-10-07 19:36:00,7971,My plans fell through this morning so I decided to head down to the local creek.  I checked the water levels online and it showed extremely low...and with little rain in the past several days I wasn't hopeful for anything.  I was hoping for an early bow or brown....  I got to the pool and saw chinooks there.  I wasn't expecting a fresh run on them on a day like today!!  I decided to drift it anyways and I hooked into 7 fish!   It was crazy.  I only had a 4 lb floro leader so I broke most off early in the fight.  This one however I was able to control somewhat and after a 5 minute fight this one finally came in!    it sure was fun tussling with those bigguns!!
938610,huzzsaba,2015-10-07 20:04:00,884,"Nice!  Looks fresh!  Just curious, how far was this from the river mouth?  Thinking of trying some creeks in the west end of gta but not sure if they come that far up."
938618,ccmtcanada,2015-10-07 20:35:00,7971,Thanks!  This wasn't close to the mouth at all.  Probably a kilometre away. That's why I was so surprised they were there.
938626,misfish,2015-10-07 21:01:00,29133,ON THE PIN ???????????????   Nice fish Cliff. Grats dude.
938628,ccmtcanada,2015-10-07 21:17:00,7971,"Brian.  Not on the pin.  Used my 12' float rod, 6lb mainline and 4 lb leader.  Thought for sure I'd lose it. lol."

Thanks for the comments guys!   haha not at all, i've always said if you can figure where someone was fishing from a tiny bit of background, then you've fished that spot many times yourself.  Its a nice pool to fish though!"
