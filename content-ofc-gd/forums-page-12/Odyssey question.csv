1079500,kickingfrog,2022-03-28 00:23:00,8333,My son's team has made the finals in Oakville this coming weekend so a trip to the Muskie Odyssey is likely. Do many/any lure vendors take credit or debit cards?
1079515,Barry Willis,2022-03-28 18:04:00,180,"Howdy Kickingfrog; First and foremost congratulations to your son and team. As far as the vendors. It's kinda hard to say. Personally, I wouldn't take a chance on it."

I also understand why small businesses wouldn't want to pay the fees the card companies charge."
1079520,Barry Willis,2022-03-28 20:33:00,180,"You're right about that. A lot people don't realize is that the little debit machine that you enter your card on, the business where you are making your purchase pays a rental fee to the bank for these and sometimes depending on their contract they are charged for each transaction. So in other words some vendors are unlikely to have one."
