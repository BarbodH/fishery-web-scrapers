1079163,pike slayer,2022-03-14 22:49:00,1177,Just priced the 25hp it‚Äôs in my price range power tilt is special order and they said I‚Äôd be lucky to even get one in 2023. Looks like I‚Äôll be getting the 25hp with just e-start
1079189,NSXNeal,2022-03-16 17:19:00,4,"I owned a new 14' Lund (SSV-14) and matched a 20 hp tiller Honda 4 stroke to it.¬† The Honda 20 had pwr tilt/trim. Now I may be wrong and am here to learn.¬† But you've described your ""home"" lake as rocky and lots of submerged reefs, etc, making for treacherous navigation.¬† With my Honda 20 tilt/trim the motor was basically locked down, unable to ""flip up"" if/when it hit an object.¬† In my two trips into ONT (Missinaibi Lake and White Lake) it scared the bejusus outta me to not be able to flip up, risking the entire lower unit somewhere remote. I sold the rig after a year, thinking my next boat buy will be tiller with no tilt/trim for this¬† reason. Thoughts? ?"
1079208,pike slayer,2022-03-17 01:27:00,1177,Yeah my camp is in the same area as white lake. For tilt/trim on a 25hp Yamaha dealer said it‚Äôs a special order and I‚Äôd be lucky to get one by summer 2023
1079211,smitty55,2022-03-17 05:09:00,928,"That's an excellent point I never would have thought of having never owned a power trim engine, so my knowledge is limited.¬† I never lock down my outboards unless I was back trolling into a good wind.¬† Nothing bigger than 20hp. I definitely will admit to having more than once being forced to quickly lift it out of the water as an unexpected hump magically appeared while exploring new runs on windy days.  Cheers"
1079215,akaShag,2022-03-17 12:28:00,2073,"same here.¬† But I ""need"" power tilt on my next rig.¬† My back is getting crankier, and pulling up the motor to recover the boat at the launch is very unkind to my creaky old back.¬† The motor is a 40 hp Honda and weighs about 400 pounds if memory serves me.........¬† So I can buy a new prop or a new lower unit if I spank a shoal, but I can't get a replacement spine...........üôÑ"
1079220,Sinker,2022-03-17 13:55:00,8692,"Ok a few things from my experience. A 25 yammie will troll as slow as any other sized outboard, with ease, smooth as can be, and quieter than the water pumping out of it, ALL DAY, no problem.¬† The digital troll control is SWEET! ALWAYS get the max HP. Did i mention ALWAYS? I opted to get the lift assist with my 40 yammy (also a 16ft boat). Like said, I don't want my engine locked down while I'm in shallow water, or running unknown lakes. The beauty of lift assist is I can hit neutral, and push down on the tiller handle with one finger, and up comes my engine, then I can lock it in shallow drive and idle along until I know I'm safe. I use it TONS. Especially duck hunting. You can't run at speed that way, but if your on plane, you don't want to be trimmed up that high anyways. "
1079296,pike slayer,2022-03-20 22:52:00,1177,So I bought the boat package with the 25hp that‚Äôs for the help guys!
1079325,Gil Levesque,2022-03-22 10:21:00,103,"Loony, its a 16 ft.Mirrocraft 3696 utility. Highly modified!! Lol!"
1079328,Loonietoon,2022-03-22 13:13:00,1450,Thanks Gil Love the setup you have just looking to do something with the 14ft tinny l bought last year to use in small places
1079097,pike slayer,2022-03-12 00:16:00,1177,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm looking at purchasing this boat https://www.kijiji.ca/v-powerboat-motorboat/oshawa-durham-region/2022-mirrocraft-3696s-utility-fishing-boat/1606800821 it‚Äôs rated for a max of 25hp. The lake that My camp is on is a large inland lake but with tons of islands rock piles and shoals. It‚Äôs a dangerous lake if you don‚Äôt know where your going. I was originally thinking of getting the 15hp. The dealer is trying up sell me and get the 25hp. What should I get? Go in between and get the 20hp? I do all walleye fishing with a lot of trolling. I do not need a speed demon but don‚Äôt want to be pushing water either. Im going with a Yamaha outboard."
1079099,Fisherman,2022-03-12 00:57:00,7201,"If you don't go with the max, then 3/4 is pretty much the low end or 20HP."
1079100,Terry,2022-03-12 01:09:00,14456,"It‚Äôs a 16 ft boat, go with the 25"
1079101,smitty55,2022-03-12 01:22:00,928,"The only issue I see with a 25 over a 20 is the 25 might not troll down slow enough without a trolling plate or drift sock. For instance I like to troll lead core or copper and gang trolls for Lakers where the optimum speed is 1 mph and I doubt a 25 would go that slow, although with the newer 4 strokes it might with the right pitch prop."
1079102,Steve,2022-03-12 01:28:00,2075,I would assume the Yamaha would have the rpm button that will allow you to troll down to 600 rpm. 
1079103,dave524,2022-03-12 10:35:00,4508,"A 25 seems very conservative, back in the day dad had a 14 Mirro , basically their popular at the time deep fisherman model but with a steering wheel and a 35 Rude, friend's dad had the 16 foot version with the side console and he had a 55 Johnson, maybe the hulls were wider back then but I'd stay with the max."
1079104,RandyLinden,2022-03-12 12:09:00,40,"Hi There are usually not many negative things when maxing out the HP on a boat. Maybe a few dollars more but I suggest that you consider the benefits of the 25HP before deciding. The 25HP will make the boat perform the way is was intended to work. It will get on plane in a shorter distance and in the most efficient way (I have experienced better fuel economy with a 25HP over a 15HP because the engine isn't working as hard) You will get the best speed performance and I know you indicated that speed was not a factor for you but its nice to have it when you want it. Just because it will go quicker doesn't mean you have to run it fast all the time but maybe if you want to get off the lake because of a T storm you might appreciate the extra speed. As I mentioned before your fuel economy should also be good if you don't need to run it hard. Another thing that might be a factor is the weight or load you have in the boat. If you only ever go alone with your fishing gear that's a pretty light load but what if you decide to add an extra fuel tank, maybe a battery or two and a nice bow mount electric steer/spot lock trolling motor? What about bringing another angler and his gear plus a cooler etc.? You might not do any of these things initially but down the road you may want to and the boat will be ready for that with the 25HP. I upgraded a similar boat (Lund) from a 15 to a 25 and the difference in overall performance was night and day. It also increased my travel range because it was faster and made the boat work properly. I actually traded in that new 25HP only a month old for an upgraded 25HP with electric start and power trim/tilt and I would highly recommend this as well. It is worth the extra money without any doubt. The power trim/tilt, it makes a huge difference in the way the boat works including being able to dial it in on those rougher water conditions. You will need a battery on board but that was also a bonus because I added running lights, a really good sonar/gps and a plug to run my radio... It goes on and on but at the heart of it is the 25HP. Best of luck and enjoy that new boat!"
1079105,glen,2022-03-12 12:23:00,2641,Boat is 64‚Äù wide. Weight 343lb. ¬† 	very similar to boats I have used. ¬† 	two people 400lb. and 200lb of gear. ¬† 	with the right prop.¬† 	a 15hp will work. ¬†20mph. ¬† 	a 20hp 25mph.¬† 	a 25mph. 30 mph. I would take one over the other. If efi is an option.¬† 	is the 25 a lot heavier then the 15. 
1079106,glen,2022-03-12 12:30:00,2641,25 is 126lb to 146lb ¬†and ¬†EFI 15and 20 is 111 lb. ¬†Carb. so I‚Äôd give up the efi to have a lighter engine. ¬† 	If I was going to load it heavy then 20 if not I‚Äôd go 15.
1079108,pike slayer,2022-03-12 12:49:00,1177,A lot of the time there will be 3 ppl in the boat. The 25hp does have the variable trolling switch to dial it right down. And the 25hp is very close in weight. I only priced the 15hp I think I‚Äôll be going back to the dealer to see the price difference. Yamaha site says the 15 is $3600-4000 and the 25 is $4600-5800 not a huge difference
1079109,glen,2022-03-12 13:03:00,2641,Between 20 and 25 then.¬† 	how heavy are the people if heavy (600) then 25.
1079110,DanD,2022-03-12 14:23:00,2223,"I had a 16' starcraft with a 40 Suzuki oil injected 2 stroke. That was the max HP for this tiller boat. With the factory settings on the motor, I could never get my speed down to where I wanted it. So I popped the hood and lowered the idle speed: great I got the boat down to the speed I wanted. But then I ended up with an engine stall if I dropped to an idle too quickly. If I took my time bringing the motor to an idle, the thing would plug along all day long. To cure this I added an electric solenoid to the throttle stop, connected to a toggle switch. When I was out cruising around I turned the solenoid on, keeping idle at the recommended speed. Then when I wanted to troll I would turn the solenoid off dropping my idle. My point being is don't be afraid of the larger motor, there's always a way around one issue or another. You may also want to increase the number of friends you have? On a day you're going to be drifting and casting, invite slim. Then on a day you're trolling ask BUBBA, on days both slim and BUBBA are with you, the 25hp will have a day to stretch its legs and love it. LOL Dan."

1079122,Dara,2022-03-13 13:09:00,3052,I saw that boat up at Northshore the other day. Not a heavy boat but you want at least the 20. I had an old Mirrocraft 14' with a 15 2 stroke and that was just enough. Actually I sold it to a guy on your lake.
1079125,Gil Levesque,2022-03-13 15:53:00,103,"Slayer, ive got a minnkota pd55 with ipilot on the front and boat is a little heavier as ive added front and rear casting platforms plus storage areas. The bimmini folds down out of the way right in front of the motor!  "
