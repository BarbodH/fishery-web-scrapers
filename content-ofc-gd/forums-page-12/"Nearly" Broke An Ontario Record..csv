1079212,Moosebunk,2022-03-17 12:15:00,3970,Can imagine these western ling that are twice as big... but kinda don't want to imagine. lol Thanks fellas.
1079218,AKRISONER,2022-03-17 13:39:00,5558,"funny bunk, ling are sought after here, but in manitoba they were consider to be a nuisance so much so that they held a burbot derby every year on athapap to clean out the burbot. Many people attribute to the improved fishing to this derby but I also think it has a lot to do with manitoba moving from a 6 walleye per person limit down to 4? and barbless."
