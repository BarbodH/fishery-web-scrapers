1078715,glen,2022-02-18 21:32:00,2641,I’m watching a show with Roland Martin and he is drone fishing.  The drone puts the bait in front of the fish.  Then when you get bit you fly the drone in and unhook the line.

1078718,Fisherman,2022-02-18 22:31:00,7201,"There was another one similar, they were using the drone to drop the bait and weight far away as they couldn't cast that distance.  Fishing for sturgeon."
1078719,glen,2022-02-18 22:35:00,2641,I never said I was going to do it.  My fish would pull the drone under.  Lol.
1078721,LefroyFisherman,2022-02-18 23:41:00,602,Lol!

We all know,when yer getting old and the legs are not like they once were, a walk has to be worth it. Need to get one with zoom lens, peeps are not like they were as well. Follow that lefroy guy around.LOL"
