1078675,tomkat,2022-02-17 02:19:00,246,They were always my favourite spinnerbaits for musky. Can’t seem to find them anymore. Does anyone know where to get them?
1078678,206,2022-02-17 03:07:00,563,"https://www.amazon.ca/Lindy-Muskie-Tandem-Black-Chartreuse/dp/B003NCMYPQ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Lindy+M%2FG+Muskie+Tandem&qid=1645067833&sr=8-1 here's a start, unfortunately sold out everywhere"
1078686,Snakecharmer,2022-02-17 15:15:00,30,Where are you located?  I'm pretty sure I have a bunch unused in my basement. I'll check and post some photos. You can make an offer if you wish. Cheaper than $51.............
1078687,Snakecharmer,2022-02-17 16:07:00,30,So far I have just found Lindy Big-Fin Spiinerbaits (10) and Lindy Little Joe Giant Tandem Spin (7). I'll need to dig a little deeper into my basement.  Here's an example of each .  
1078699,tomkat,2022-02-18 00:22:00,246,Thx those aren’t the same baits though.
1078701,Snakecharmer,2022-02-18 00:59:00,30,Yea I need to dig deeper into my storage crates. I think I have a couple.
1078703,Snakecharmer,2022-02-18 02:36:00,30,I found 2 - Mepps style gold blade with a purple marabou tail (MT215) and Green/Orange/Chartreuse Tandem (MT113)   
1078704,Weeds,2022-02-18 03:29:00,782,I’d love to have a peek in that basement. Well stocked. Any chance you’ve got a crate of spare Slopmaster spinnerbaits? Caught my first musky on one; will forever hold a special place in my heart.
1078706,Snakecharmer,2022-02-18 03:51:00,30,"Funny you should ask..... I do have a box full. What style/ color are you looking for? I'll take a photo or two tomorrow.  Ever come to Cleveland?  If the border gets back to normal, I may be able to send some back with one of my cousins in Toronto or Barrie."
1078717,Weeds,2022-02-18 21:56:00,782,"Wow. That’s some basement. Think it was considered natural/nickel. Single Colorado blade. Mind you, I was only half way serious, I’d have to mortgage my house if I had to come up with enough cash to buy a box of musky baits at todays prices. I think the last time I bought one it was from Lebarons and was about 12 bucks. Thought it expensive then!"
