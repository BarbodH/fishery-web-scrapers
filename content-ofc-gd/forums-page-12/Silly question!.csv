1078870,Rattletrap2,2022-02-27 15:44:00,1652,I was thinking of trying to get Grandkids out on Simcoe during March break (14 to18th) with a rental hut but then it dawned on me……..are all the huts off by the 15th?
1078871,misfish,2022-02-27 16:22:00,29133,When the hell did that happen? LOL You should have some nice days by then to just walk out and fish outside Mr.B. 
1078873,Rattletrap2,2022-02-27 18:06:00,1652,"10 &6 years old! Lol ok for me to walk out, but not them! Do you know if all hut operators still have to have their huts off by the 15th?"
1078874,DanD,2022-02-27 18:13:00,2223,"Now don't quote me on this, but I believe overnight huts must be off the ice by the 16th. That doesn't mean that all the operators are done. There still might be a few who are willing to pull their huts out for the day (If there's the demand)? I think if you wanted to get the grandkids out then you'll still have a chance. As Brian said the weather could be very cooperative by then and you could fish outside. Then there's the whole experience of ice fishing for the first few times. Being taxied out to a hut in some form of sled or the hut itself. Where there is either wood or propane heat, seats, holes drilled, and the choice of fishing inside or out. Then there's the midday meal/snack that's heated or cooked out there. The first few times my brothers took me with them; I didn't give a crap what the fishing was like. I enjoyed the whole experience of being there with them and that they allowed me to go with them. Any fish caught were just a bonus to the day. Dan... Just to clarify; I don't just mean ice bungalows, but any hut occupied or not, can't be left out on the ice for the night after that date."
1078876,Rattletrap2,2022-02-27 18:31:00,1652,Good thoughts Dan! That is really what I was thinking. The positive and pleasant experience is more important than the actual fish count!
1078877,misfish,2022-02-27 18:50:00,29133,Yes all huts off on the 15. Permys.
1079154,David Chong,2022-03-14 15:51:00,836,"Yes, that is correct! All pernament huts including outfitters' must be off the ice by tomorrow! So that would be the day!"
1079155,misfish,2022-03-14 17:26:00,29133,Looks like the next few days will be primo for walking about. Last day tomorrow for lakers and whities on the Lady.  Going to be so nice when the season opens again during soft water. I can cruise around with the electric on the float boat.
