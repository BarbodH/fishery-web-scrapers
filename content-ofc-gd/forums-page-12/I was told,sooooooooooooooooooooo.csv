Well today was the day I finally figured out,I really do not need more,well I do,but will have to get another station to store it. When I started fly tying I had a small box given to me by Fisherman,¬† a plain vice and some supplies. Just wanted to have¬† something to do on those non fishing days .Once I realized there was so much to tie, well, I need to buy more of this,more of that and ya,some more of everything. About a week ago,I was told I had to get my mess cleaned up. Was not sure what she meant,as I knew where everything was lying around. HA HA HA. Well she was right,I had stuffed stashed here and there,bags of stuff here,box or 2,3,4 over there. Ok I get it now, so I picked up a new storage cart to go with what I already had bought to store my stuff. I started off with a small 3 drawer thing,then bought the multy drawer thing. Figured that was good enough,but now my new station with the addition of the 12 drawer seems to have gotten 3/4 of my stuff out of bags,boxes and off the floor.I have I have more stuff then I thought,but I need it ALL. üòÇ When she gets home,I am sure she will be pleased,but shhhhhhhhhhh, she can not know I just bought a bunch more supplies today, that I need,want.

1079190,misfish,2022-03-16 17:22:00,29133,"Do not be fooled. If I open those drawers,things will pop out. Yes,I learned to do tight sheet corners,but not in the Army.LOL "
