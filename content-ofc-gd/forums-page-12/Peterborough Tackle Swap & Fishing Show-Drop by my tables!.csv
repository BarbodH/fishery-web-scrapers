I think that my tables are #8. 9 & 10! Mention that you're a OFC member and I've got something for you! Looking forward to chatting fishing with people in person!"
1079275,GBW,2022-03-19 23:56:00,8460,"Hey man, see you after we have breakfast in LIndsay at Queen's Bistro.¬† So maybe around 10:30 / 11:00'ish."
1079288,Big Cliff,2022-03-20 18:03:00,6899,"Holly... the line up to get in was huge, across the parking lot, down to the next street and half a block down that one and it was the same when we left... much more than I expected and so crowded I really didn't have a chance to shop but good to see so many people out."
1079299,GBW,2022-03-20 23:47:00,8460,The lack of parking and the huge line turned my wife and I away.¬† We BOTH wanted to see everyone and what the vendors had but I was not willing to waste 1/2 a day in line to be pushed out for a 3PM clse time so we left after seeing the line and tring to find ANY parking for 20-30 minutes. Wish I was able to walk in and see some folk but sadly not today...
1079301,AKRISONER,2022-03-21 13:48:00,5558,Really unfortunate about the crowds. I know another group that arrived and bailed and went and ate panzerottis in a parking lot while watching bass live.
1079303,David Chong,2022-03-21 15:21:00,836,"Yeah, I talked to many who waited in line for 1-1 1/2 hours in order to get in! I guess they should look for a larger venue next year! I was insanely busy in there all day long, never had a chance to wander around even which probably was good for my pocket book! LOL The North GTA Tackle Swap on Sat. April 2 in Newmarket will have quality vendors and shouldn't be as crazy busy! Hope to see some members out there! Only a TOONIE or a donation of a non-perishable food item for entrance fee!"
1079304,David Chong,2022-03-21 15:22:00,836,"Sorry to hear that, you were not alone! Too bad we didn't get to see you!"
1079306,fisherman7,2022-03-21 15:32:00,325,"We saw over 200 people in line at 12pm, and left! Good for the vendors though. Need a bigger venue for next year and maybe run over 2 days."
1079309,AKRISONER,2022-03-21 17:45:00,5558,If I‚Äôm not fishing Im going to try and make it to this even just to meet some people
1079312,misfish,2022-03-21 21:17:00,29133,ME??????????????? LOL 
1079317,misfish,2022-03-21 22:18:00,29133,"I,ll be there looking for a used HT auger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1079331,AKRISONER,2022-03-22 14:12:00,5558,we already met¬† and that was enough¬†üòÅ
1079364,Snidley,2022-03-23 16:12:00,620,Is the Hamilton swap meet still on this year on the 28th of March?

1079372,Snidley,2022-03-23 17:29:00,620,Be there of be square. It's a great stop for tackle junkies. Dave do you have any of those Arcadia Reef lures left?
1079373,David Chong,2022-03-23 17:51:00,836,"Don't believe so! Got so much, I'll actually have to check when I unpack everything there!"
1079374,Snidley,2022-03-23 18:03:00,620,I'll see you there anyway
