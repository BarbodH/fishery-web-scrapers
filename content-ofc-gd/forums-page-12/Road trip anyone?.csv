1079239,Big Cliff,2022-03-18 08:39:00,6899,I am thinking of heading down to Myrtle Beach in about two weeks to do a bit of pier fishing (about the end of March) (the whities should be running really well by then) and perhaps dig a pail or two of clams and oysters. Anyone interested? Flexable travel dates and length of stay.
