1079065,misfish,2022-03-09 19:49:00,29133,"The past 2 days I have probly walked 5-7 miles drilling here and there. Yesterday was a bust,just one whitie on and unbutton half way up.It sure was a great day to just walk and fish though. No hub,heater,just the finder,auger and sleigh. This morning was the same,another great day to just go and explore. Every hole I drilled there were perch. Anywhere from 29 fow up to 16 fow. I probly hooked well over the 100 mark in 5 hours. This morning before I left,I did a quick tie of a couple of shrimp scuds. Turned out to be the right move. 98% of the perch took the high hook tandem above a Meegs bait. Even got 2 on the Meegs. Really like the pin set up combo. The tip on this rod is so sensitive. You can even pick up a bite when the perch take the fly up. I could of easy kept a 50 limit,but I do not freeze fish and I hate cleaning these buggers. LOL  Going to be fresh fried taco,s tonight.   "

1079071,GBW,2022-03-09 22:49:00,8460,That looks like a nice 12 pack on ice...
1079073,misfish,2022-03-09 23:28:00,29133,"I keep walking like I have been and breaking down pounds,I might see a 4 pack. LOL "
1079074,gordy28,2022-03-09 23:53:00,638,Looks like a solid time Brian how thick is the ice on Simcoe?   Did last weeks warm weather do anything other than melt snow? heading to Haliburton this weekend and hope to drill some holes as well Andrew
1079075,misfish,2022-03-10 00:14:00,29133,"No lose.but I did find the first few inches were getting soft. 20"" today. north end, there was almost 28-30."
1079076,gordy28,2022-03-10 00:19:00,638,Awesome.   Thanks Brian! Andrew

1079086,Barry Willis,2022-03-10 20:39:00,180,"This may be old news and I expect it is (yeah I know I've been out of touch and need to get out more) but several years ago I was watching of course a fishing show and the host had a hand held little unit that after clearing the snow from the ice he poured water on it and held this device or a part of in the water on the ice and it gave him the depth and would even mark fish. I figured what a time saver, it would sure eliminate alot of the guess work and the time it takes to drill holes. At that time they were around $150:00 which I thought was a little pricy but on the other hand, less wear and tear on the auger not to mention myself. I don't remember what they are called."
1079087,misfish,2022-03-10 21:02:00,29133,"I zip through the ice with my electric set up in seconds and my battery's last all day,so no need for that thing, and yes , there are so many myths out there about using a transducer through the ice. Even one with using windshield washer in a bag with the ducer. My finbor 3  6"" ,is 10 years old,(right Terry) and cuts like a hot knife through butta. I look for possible spots and only drill on them. I just dont drill anywhere and here.  Back at it in the morning byes. Perch were mighty tasty, and well,I would love another nice fresh feed. Might do a breaky dinner of fried eggs and fish and some smokey bacon.  Dang,got me drooling already."
1079090,glen,2022-03-11 02:04:00,2641,Good luck out there.   	another year of no ice fishing for me.
1079096,Rizzo,2022-03-11 23:25:00,4754,What a difference a good auger makes! Just upgraded mine a few weeks back and man what a difference
1079205,akaShag,2022-03-17 01:06:00,2073,"I bet ten people have sent me that video over the years.  The guy CLAIMS he could do that in ten seconds, and I call Bull on that.  AND HE LEAVES ALL THE BONES IN.  Who on earth wants to eat a perch with the bones still in?  That is a pathetic excuse for cleaning perch, and a great big fat lie about how long it takes.  Perch are a dream to fillet because of their bone structure.  And a person who is skilled with a filleting knife can take a perch and produce two boneless, skinless fillets in well under a minute. Doug"
1079217,Barry Willis,2022-03-17 13:18:00,180,"I totally agree Shag, What's the point if you are going to leave the bones in. I can fillet a perch a lot quicker the old traditional way. Not in ten seconds as he claims which as you mentioned is Bull but still quicker and easier and no bones. Who wants them?"
