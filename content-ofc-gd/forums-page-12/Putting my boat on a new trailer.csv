1077215,LostAnotherOne,2021-11-20 17:02:00,956,"Was 30 minutes into my trip this morning to HH and unfortunately I had to call CAA to bring in the flatbed.  The trailer is a 94 so I’m not looking to repair it, but to purchase a brand new one come March.  The trailer is severely damaged and won’t be leaving my property.  So I’m wondering what’s the best way to move my 14’ onto another brand new trailer once I purchase it?  Thanks I’m advance"
1077218,Fisherman,2021-11-20 18:54:00,7201,"Set the boat back and up on some wooden blocks like cribbing both sides at the back, start gently pulling the old trailer forward and about 2-3 feet from the bow add another support. When the new trailer arrives,  just start cranking it onto the trailer.  Been there done that with a 16 foot."
1077233,Hack_Fisherman,2021-11-20 23:21:00,720,"Tire stacks are good for cribbing if you have summer tires on rims. Push boat back if on rollers, crank jack up so rear of boat leaves trailer and slowly pull forward. Before boat leaves trailer, build wood/concrete block cribbing under vee or use axle stand to pull trailer free. Do reverse to load boat. A 14’ boat isn’t really heavy. Just make sure it’s stable and watch your skeg"
1077239,glen,2021-11-21 10:36:00,2641,If the boat is 600ish pounds you can put it on grass and winch on from there.
1077240,Garnet,2021-11-21 12:52:00,2056,Adjusting the new trailer for your boat is another engineering feat. Once boat is on the trailer and adjustments needed lower tongue jack completely then crib back of boat. Raise tongue jack. Taking boat off rails make adjustments and lower boat back on trailer.
1079265,LostAnotherOne,2022-03-19 16:01:00,956,Managed to put the boat on the new trailer this morning.  Luckily zero issues came up.  Thanks for the advice guys.     
1079277,Dara,2022-03-20 03:06:00,3052,Those pictures look funny. I can't see over the snowbanks in my driveway. Lots are 6' high or better With the sun and rain the last few days the snow has settled to 3' deep in my yard
1079279,LostAnotherOne,2022-03-20 13:40:00,956,Not sure why the pictures turned out like that.  You may have to bend your neck to look at them lol.  Here in Norfolk county we got hardly any snow left.
1079281,Wallyman,2022-03-20 15:19:00,31,Just curios. Do you have any of your boat hanging off the bunks at the back? Regards 
1079282,LostAnotherOne,2022-03-20 17:12:00,956,Looks like it’s 6” from the bottom of the transom.  Similar to the previous trailer.
1079284,Gil Levesque,2022-03-20 17:28:00,103,You have plenty of room to move your winch forward . Your bunks should reach past the transom! After moving put a weigh scale under the coupler . You want about.... 10% of gross weight at the coupler! Cheers!
1079290,Wallyman,2022-03-20 18:53:00,31,Yes  this is why I asked.  Try to have about an inch of your bunk past your boat.  This helps support your transom when traveling and your motor is  torquing the back of your boat when hitting bumps.

1079293,Mr Greedydrift,2022-03-20 19:37:00,25,"Good advice, yours bunks should extend past the transom to avoid hull damage. More important for heavier boats but why take the chance"
1079294,LostAnotherOne,2022-03-20 19:47:00,956,Thank you guys for the tips.  I’ll be sure to do that before heading out next Saturday.  Adjusting the winch mount looks pretty simple.
1079297,Dara,2022-03-20 23:04:00,3052,"It's not the pictures, it's the lack of snow. Now you are talking putting the boat in and we are still using ALL of the auger to drill an ice hole Just strikes me as funny. Enjoy the new trailer. Can't beat reliable equipment"
