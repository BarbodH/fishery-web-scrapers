1078233,DRIFTER_016,2022-01-19 18:49:00,10439,Dara Tried to BBQ last night. Had to order pizza.Â ðŸ˜Œ
1078237,Dara,2022-01-19 19:31:00,3052,Bummer. I hope it was just BBQ tank and not the furnace tank. Is the ice road open to camp yet?
1078243,aplumma,2022-01-19 20:25:00,6896,I got to admit y'all have Paradise up North if only I could have Southern temperatures to enjoy up there.  Art
1078257,akaShag,2022-01-20 01:23:00,2073,"Art, we have those here in the SUMMER time!Â  And I can't wait for summer to pass so we can get cooler weather again! Doug"
1078258,DRIFTER_016,2022-01-20 01:35:00,10439,"Yep, BBQ tank. Our cabin owners road is in, not the big one yet. It's usually done in February."
1078299,scuro2,2022-01-23 04:35:00,904,If I am a leftist then that makes you a conspiracy luvin' knowitall? How else to explain the universal acceptance of the science an model of climate change. Take the time to see the science as presented by the climate scientists. May I suggest starting with the ice core samples? Beautiful science.
1078649,cuba2007,2022-02-16 16:40:00,15,"Yes, science explains climate change very well.Â  Is it true?Â  Maybe...Â  Check the nightly news, weather on TV.Â  See the records for this day....Â  How does science explain that??? Weather on this planet is cyclical!Â  That means it comes and goes in cycles!!Â  And therefore, (in layman's terms), we will be cooling off on the entire planet soon.Â  Next year?Â  No.Â  But eventually."
1078651,tomkat,2022-02-16 17:44:00,246, Thought this was a site to discuss fishing and tackle and boats and stuff? Could be a nice break from vaccines and climate change and a bunch of other stuff people donâ€™t agree on. I doubt anybody ever changed their mind about anything because some guy on a fishing site told them otherwise lol! 
1078668,Dara,2022-02-17 00:04:00,3052,"If we had a government worth their salt they would tax the heck out of all carbon burning and people would quit using it and the worlds problem would be solved. People in the ""big smoke"" could walk to go fishing  Too bad they can't just use electricity for everything. I hear thats clean. Especially when it comes from...hmmmÂ  where was that again..burning coal?"
1078673,tomkat,2022-02-17 01:53:00,246,Ugh itâ€™s endless lol!
1078674,John Bacon,2022-02-17 02:18:00,3277,"Empty?Â  Or, just too cold for propane? "
1078688,DRIFTER_016,2022-02-17 17:26:00,10439,Just too cold JB
1078722,scuro2,2022-02-19 01:51:00,904,Can you believe your concern was the first thing scientists considered?!???
1077847,DRIFTER_016,2021-12-28 17:06:00,10439,I can't see my @$$ getting off the couch today.Â Â ðŸ¥¶ 
1077848,aplumma,2021-12-28 17:22:00,6896,Ahh the whole dramatic metric system -38 C that is only -36 F .... Personally when I inhale through my nose and my boogers freeze I'm heading back indoors. lol.  Art
1077850,Ron,2021-12-28 17:43:00,1683,Canadian T-shirt weather.
1077852,aplumma,2021-12-28 20:13:00,6896,I would call you a liar but I have seen to many crock shoe prints in the snow up North. Art
1077853,smitty55,2021-12-28 20:31:00,928,I saw a post yesterday saying that 4 of the 5 coldest places on earth were in Canada. So much for global warming. 
1077854,Fisherman,2021-12-28 21:21:00,7201,"Well in BC they've been burnt, drowned, now frozen,Â  wonder what's next."
1077857,misfish,2021-12-28 21:56:00,29133,VANHELLA
1077860,Dara,2021-12-29 13:50:00,3052,Well...It's making ice 
1077868,akaShag,2021-12-29 18:03:00,2073,"That was my thought, EXACTLY!Â  Bring it on!!!!!! Doug"
1077879,Cast-Away,2021-12-30 16:15:00,790,Yikes is what my wife said when she read this!
1077882,Hack_Fisherman,2021-12-30 22:53:00,720,Only in march when weâ€™ve had enough
1077898,pics,2022-01-01 12:41:00,1268,"I saw a small boat on Hamilton harbour yesterday,Â  heading out to the lake to fish. When I went to bed last night (new years eve) it was 9 Celsius.. nothing is frozen here and no hut operators are out on Nip."
1077912,Rizzo,2022-01-02 18:05:00,4754,wow those are some crazy temps. got me shivering over here just thinking about that
1078057,scuro2,2022-01-13 14:39:00,904,"Tell that to the people in the interior of BC where the all time Canadian heat record was shattered atÂ  just a touch under 50 degrees.Â   	Seriously dude, if your older then 30 you know winters have changed. Here we are in mid Jan and for most of this winter I've seen some grass sticking out on my lawn."
1078068,smitty55,2022-01-14 01:25:00,928,"Yea right. Meanwhile the poles have more ice than ever in a long time. Many places in the world are getting record low temps. Arctic air is now reaching the gulf of Mexico last week and California was getting record snowfalls with 122 inches of snow in the last week alone. Jet streams are all over the place. So how do you explain that? If you really cared to do some research instead of falling for all the climate change alarmists you would realize that most of Earths weather is influenced by solar flare activity and El Nino and La Nina. as well as the tilt of the earths axis which can be affected by volcanoes even. The earth has just hit one of the five coldest Novembers in history. 	And yes I'm over 60 and for sure weather has always been in a state of flux as it still is but it's not because of human activity and a little bit of extra CO2 in the atmosphere. Every major climate emergency these alarmist have screamed about have proven to be unfounded, sea levels aren't rising, the poles aren't melting, polar bears are going extinct, blah blah blah. 	Believe whatever you want, I really couldn't care less."
1078069,Weeds,2022-01-14 12:12:00,782,"If you donâ€™t care what people think why would you spend 20 minutes making your case? Sure, the weather/climate has been historically subject to erratic extremes but that doesnâ€™t mean climate change isnâ€™t at least a possibility."
1078070,Weeds,2022-01-14 12:38:00,782,"Smitty; that wasnâ€™t intended to be a holier than thou type of comment. Personally Iâ€™ve done nothing to change my carbon footprint, would gladly make a Unimog my daily driver if someone gave me one."
1078091,smitty55,2022-01-15 03:17:00,928,"I said I didn't care what he believed, but I did respond to his comment with facts other than one hot summer in BC. Yea what I said is that climate change is always happening but it's not because of human activity compared to other effects. "
1078185,scuro2,2022-01-17 22:21:00,904,Good thing there's youtube. Those climate experts are trying to pulling the wool over our eyes!
1078211,smitty55,2022-01-18 23:05:00,928,"That's not what you originally posted is it? Typical leftist response, when faced with facts just resort to insulting remarks. You should check out OOD, you'd fit in nicely there. Btw I've seen plenty of posts with those reports and not one of them was on youtube so you shouldn't make assumptions because you know what that does eh? 	That's my last response, no use wasting my time on you"
1078213,aplumma,2022-01-18 23:56:00,6896,IF you all take this in this direction I will lock it. There are no winners in this discussion only people complaining and making my life a little harder. Thanks Art
1078219,DRIFTER_016,2022-01-19 15:28:00,10439,Art Figure I better post in American for ya!!!Â ðŸ˜œ How do you like that -60 wind chill? 
1078223,Terry,2022-01-19 16:37:00,14456,I think - 38f is about -38.89 Â so not much difference 
1078227,tomkat,2022-01-19 17:36:00,246,Yeah but itâ€™s a dry cold lol! 
1078229,Dara,2022-01-19 18:17:00,3052,It's always coldest right before the sun comes up. Glad my daughter got the heater on her propane tank
