I've been searching the internet but being that I've never hunted Bear and kinda buying a pig in a Polk on the internet. I was wondering if anyone here could recommend a reputable outfitter in Ontario that also has fishing available for my non hunting Girlfriend?  Thank you, Jeff Holmes"
1078327,smitty55,2022-01-25 03:28:00,928,Jeff I would suggest you join or peruse the Ontario Black Bear Hunters group. Quite a few outfitters post there and tons of members to ask questions. https://www.facebook.com/groups/225827837965816/ Cheers
