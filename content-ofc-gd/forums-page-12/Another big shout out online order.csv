They had free shipping over $100. It doesnt take long for a $100 to add up. So why not,give them a look over and their pricing is very fair and lower then some others. TOGENS FLY SHOP. Back from a few hours on the ice and I got mail today. I am locked and loaded for a while now. Also,my hook order came in from LureMaking. Giddy up go. Time to get a tying .  "

Calf tail is the worst for range of quality One lad at SAIL looked at me funny the other day when I asked for the entire hook to be pulled down for dark brown bucktail, found 1 real good one and a bunch of low grades"

Here's a couple I also like. flymart.ca -> $350 free shipping, has some good sales, really good selection of materials canadiantubeflies.net -> $50 free shipping, less selection but they have some products that are hard to find elsewhere"
1079001,Garnet,2022-03-04 21:09:00,2056,"I order from all these and a couple more, maybe I have the problem!"
1079002,misfish,2022-03-04 21:30:00,29133,I order from FLYMART alot as well Tom. They sure are having  hard time getting stock.
