1079080,OMCDinosaur,2022-03-10 14:12:00,18,"Perhaps the chamber of commerce realizes the permanent damage done to their 'tourism industry' due to selling public lands to private interests and levying non-resident restrictions.  Orillia is a dump, as the town has moved to hwy 12 and 400 and west, away from the corruption.  Orillia has a long way to go to get our $$$ back.  Stephen Leacock would be havin' a field day with the jokers running things there.....Next up...environmental damage due to ice fisherman parking on the lake...creating their own crisis and blaming on 'visitors'...this crap has to stop...OWN your issues Orillia...its not fisherman or tourists..."
1079082,LefroyFisherman,2022-03-10 15:04:00,602,Well put.
1078906,glen,2022-03-01 18:35:00,2641,Orillia perch festival.  Is it on this year?  	anyone planning to go? I’m thinking about going to get a feed of perch.
1078907,glen,2022-03-01 18:39:00,2641,Dang I just remembered the time three of us went out in my car topper. We went around a point and a huge sheet of ice blew in and we had to boat around it to get back in.  Waves coming in. Nothing but jeans on.
1078908,Terry,2022-03-01 19:28:00,14456,I don’t think it’s on this year
1078909,Fisherman,2022-03-01 20:02:00,7201,"On TV news the other night, it's CANCELLED, due to lack of prizes etc.  They going to try and do it next year."
1078911,glen,2022-03-01 23:34:00,2641,Ok thank you for the info I might just go for perch anyway
1078916,wkrp,2022-03-02 02:37:00,656,Too many sanctions for me.
1078936,LefroyFisherman,2022-03-02 21:49:00,602,"Very disappointing it's cancelled again... Seems to me a lot of not very good excuses. The app worked ok last year, I call Bull on the prizes. If you can't get prizes then why not make it strictly a cash prize then, it would be something."
1078938,irishfield,2022-03-02 22:44:00,26272,"The company that did the ""app"" last year told the organizer that they didn't have time to help him this year, so that wasn't an option for them and it was too late to scramble to make the event happen vs the other work they have ahead of them for other events this year."
1078939,LefroyFisherman,2022-03-02 23:05:00,602,"Still a lame excuse, anyway. Hopefully it runs again, but probably not."
1078940,glen,2022-03-03 01:58:00,2641,I saw a tagged perch swimming around by the narrows years ago. Never caught one.  It was fun years ago.  Nice to get out that time of year for something.
1078941,LefroyFisherman,2022-03-03 02:08:00,602,"I caught one about a decade ago and my father in law won the boat a few years ago. It was a great festival when they allowed us to fish in the marinas where the perch actually were. Seems Orillia hated the tourist money, they seemed too be actively trying too ruin it for years."
1078942,Fisherman,2022-03-03 02:43:00,7201,"1996, new boat, 2nd time out caught a $1000 perch, bought the wife a dishwasher.  Somebody up there was watching out for me."
1078955,akaShag,2022-03-03 19:49:00,2073,"Remember the time we were there catching perch after perch, and nobody around us was catching squat.  When we left it was just about fistfights for guys trying to get into ""our"" spot.  😁 Good memories for sure. Doug"
1078957,Fisherman,2022-03-03 20:14:00,7201,"Yes, on the north side of Couchiching between the 2 little islands,  god that has to be about 25 years ago."
1078959,akaShag,2022-03-03 20:33:00,2073,"I am thinking a lot longer than that, maybe late 80s? Doug"
1078961,misfish,2022-03-03 22:05:00,29133,"He had a great dock to fish from Doug. Lounge chair,thermos of java and a bucket for his catch. Then they put the bars up."
1078962,Fisherman,2022-03-03 22:34:00,7201,"Now that you mention it, I'm pretty sure you're right, I didn't have the 16' boat yet."
1078963,Fisherman,2022-03-03 22:36:00,7201,"Miserable buggers,  and me than can't do acrobatics or pole vault.  I can remember way back there used to be quite a crew there and then just before ice out go crappie fishing in there after dark.  used to go smelting by Brentwood marina back in the day too."
1078964,LefroyFisherman,2022-03-03 22:41:00,602,"Funny how the perch locations changed. I started going to it in 2007 with my wife’s family, they had done it for years prior. We used too always sit just south of the main bridge with tons of other boats and slam the perch there. Then I think the construction started and it seems no one caught any out there anymore and it was all just in the marinas or under the bridge. I remember going to an island early on for them too."
1078965,Fisherman,2022-03-03 22:53:00,7201,"Yes, used to try going south and east out of the Narrows towards the bay in McCrae Pt, sometimes there were some bruiser perch in there."
1078966,LefroyFisherman,2022-03-03 22:58:00,602,"I have a 14.5 inch perch replica on my wall from around the cooch side of the marina, during the perch fest, was a monster."
1078978,akaShag,2022-03-04 01:12:00,2073,I think we might have been onboard my old Starcraft Holiday.  I know we were using those wire mesh fish baskets for the keepers.  Fun times!
1078986,pics,2022-03-04 08:48:00,1268,They definitely lost me as a participant when they chased away non resident fishermen by charging outrageous prices for launching and parking
1079058,David Chong,2022-03-09 14:37:00,836,It was very sad to hear about the event being cancelled! I'm going to talk to Doug Bunker from the Orillia Chamber of Commerce to get the real scoop. Hopefully they're good reasons!
1079067,akaShag,2022-03-09 20:55:00,2073,"If that works out, and if you are able to do so without betraying any confidences, perhaps you could post that here? Doug"
