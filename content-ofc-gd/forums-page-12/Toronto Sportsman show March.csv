1079250,porkpie,2022-03-18 20:46:00,2521,I donâ€™t know how Mississauga ended up on there. Â Brain error on my part I guess! Â Itâ€™s the Hamilton bass masters spring swap and itâ€™s on the 26th of March. Â Info on their Facebook.
1079257,David Chong,2022-03-19 11:45:00,836,"Look forward to see you there! I'm have tables 8, 9 & 10 in the Swap Area!"
1079258,David Chong,2022-03-19 11:47:00,836,How crowded was it? Was it not $20 to get in?
1079262,tbayboy,2022-03-19 13:42:00,1497,"I was there yesterday as well (1-3pm).Â  Sad shell of what it was before unfortunately. I never cared that much about the deals but there really was absolutely nothing this time.Â  Quick notes compared to the last one (2019 I guess - wow) - normally 2 halls (go in at entrance 5 and a bunch is there then some stuff back in the other side (entrance 1). This time just the one area.Â  Basically 3 or 4 aisles stretched over a couple big rooms. - Not too busy but it was a weekday afternoon - I swear it's the ATV show now.Â  Every spot big enough had a collection of argos/atvs/side by sides. - Couple legend boats a couple guys pushing lithium batteries, that was about it for boating stuff - Hunting variety seemed about the same maybe (not a hunter so couldn't say for sure) - Only a couple tackle dealers, none of the regulars I usually buy from during the show, was hoping to get some trolling gear but didn't bother - We usually have fun with the 'extras' but other than the archery range there wasn't any: no birds of prey, no pellet gun range, no MNR with the beavers and snakes, etc - pretty sure I counted 5 hair dressings place that kept leaping out at my wife. - There were seminars I suppose but I didn't bother waiting for any. - Maybe 10 or 12 outfitters with booths, very quiet. - Best thing was the lady selling cheescake tarts - pretty much sums it up. "
1079267,Musky Plug,2022-03-19 18:16:00,398,"They were good. Bought a couple treys. Show was disappointing. Only good tackle stand was Pro J. I did pick up a couple things though. Was hoping to hit the Lund, alumacraft shimano and h bird booths but none of them were there."
1079272,GBW,2022-03-19 21:03:00,8460,"Sweet!Â  The Mrs and I are going for breakfast then going to swing buy (get it, pun, buy vs by ;))Â  Is there a food donation bin this year?"
1079302,Toronto_Angler,2022-03-21 13:58:00,698,Went to the show on Saturday and I'll echo what was said here.Â  Not many tackle areas and lots of ATV's. I miss the days with the Arena full of events. On the plus side my kid caught a trout and was ecstatic so that made the day worthwhile 
1078885,north560,2022-02-28 15:30:00,38,I see the Sportsman Show is on for March . Wondering who will be attending . Undecided
1078886,Fisherman,2022-02-28 16:16:00,7201,"Nope, no real deals and I don't like big crowds anymore."
1078887,Terry,2022-02-28 16:43:00,14456,Nope
1078888,wkrp,2022-02-28 19:27:00,656,I'm imposing sanctions!
1078890,BillM,2022-02-28 19:37:00,17367,Only the Muskie Odyssey for this guy.
1078891,misfish,2022-02-28 20:22:00,29133,"I havent had that down there tingly feeling about any of these shows in many years. Do not get that, giddy up go daddy, feeling."
1078899,porkpie,2022-03-01 14:47:00,2521,My last experience with the sportsman show was less than exciting. Â I might go just to support shows returning. Â I will most certainly be at the Hamilton bass masters spring swap meet as I see itâ€™s returning this year and it so happens I donâ€™t start back work until the Sunday that weekend!! That should be a good one!
1078900,crappieperchhunter,2022-03-01 15:23:00,2582,"My fishing habits have not changed much in the last 20 plus years, so I really don't need any new tackle, clothing or gear. I hope they have a good turnout but I will not be in attendance."
1078912,kickingfrog,2022-03-02 00:30:00,8333,Not this year. Maybe Muskie Odyssey in part b/c we might be in Oakville for hockey that weekend anyway.
1078918,duke2555,2022-03-02 16:13:00,19,when and where is theÂ Mississauga bass masters spring swapÂ meet?

1079008,Toronto_Angler,2022-03-05 18:14:00,698,Iâ€™ll be at the Sportsmen show. Good to see it back and excited to take my 3 year old. He loves going to bass pro and sail so this will be fun for him
1079032,LeXXington,2022-03-07 14:19:00,1928,Last time I went it was less about fishing \ boating and more like a flea market.
1079033,Fisherman,2022-03-07 14:29:00,7201,"Might be doable if you live in the city, imagine just the round trip cost of gas if you're from farther away plus $20 admission."
1079047,pics,2022-03-08 17:30:00,1268,"The rent is so high that it has priced a lot of the smaller retailers out and the ones that are there don't have much for deals... I think I have enough tackle anyways ðŸ˜¬.. besides some trolling equipment and new batteries, I don't need anything ðŸ˜Ž"
1079053,410001661,2022-03-08 20:52:00,127,I'll probably go just to see some of my buddies that will be in the hunting section and some of the lodges that I know.Â  Good way to kill the better part of a week day morning/early afternoon on errrrr.......sales calls in the GTA - LOL
1079055,David Chong,2022-03-09 14:26:00,836,"Will probably drop by to check it out! It will defintely be interesting to see how many vendors would be there! Smaller tackle swaps are becoming very popular like the Hamilton Bassmasters Tackle Swap, Peterborough Tackle Swap and if you're in the GTA the North GTA Tackle Swap in Newmarket! I'll be at all 3 of these events, hope to see some OFC members there!"
1079121,Hack_Fisherman,2022-03-13 13:09:00,720,I suspect it may be much smaller than usual. The RV show was half the size from the last time I went 3-4 years ago.
1079164,wkrp,2022-03-14 22:54:00,656,I'm surprised that they didn't publish a vendors list.
1079172,GBW,2022-03-15 16:27:00,8460,Not going to this BUT I am planning of going to the PTBO swap this Sunday.
1079185,kfn,2022-03-16 15:59:00,14,Nope!!!
1079186,cuba2007,2022-03-16 16:34:00,15,"Thanks all for the replies.Â  But with no info on vendors at the show, I decided I'm not going at all.Â  Bought a new trolling motor online, so I'm good."
1079245,wkrp,2022-03-18 18:20:00,656,Just returned from the show. Pretty poor for the fisherpeople . I cannot speak for the hunters as I don't partake in hunting.Â  Waste of $15 for me. I will not be attending in the foreseeable future
