This one when asked by a member, had me puzzled at first,but in time,I was thinking of what his intentions were. I wanted to be sure this was just not a round ball jig. Wanted something that would look nice and realistic. Going through the isles at Cabelas,I found the perfect jig. Turns out they had both colors that was asked for. Shiner and perch. So not rushing into it,I looked at it in the vise and tried to visualize something. This was going to be a bit crude for the first one, plus I do not have heavy tying thread, Knowing that fly foam is very buoyant,I grabbed what I had,cut in 2, 1"" strips. Wrapped the first one, 2X, just behind the head,the next behind it. It was crude,but will give me enough knowledge is it will work. Added Faux synthetic buck tail. I can not just drop In a pail of water,as I want to see the action on a line, so waiting for some open water here to give it a trial.  I needed something else to give me a break from all these  I like the looks,just need to see if it will work as he wants.  "
