When they return to spawn in late August, they are green in colour compared to the red/orange natives who live in the river all year. Same could happen if the tributaries to Lake O had an excess of speckles and a shortage of food, forcing them into the lake to forage. I don't think that has happened in our lifetime with all the migration obstacles and damage to habitat. Stocking them into Lake O may be discouraged by their short life span compared to Lake Trout and Rainbows."

1079292,Sinker,2022-03-20 19:00:00,8692,"Who knows, maybe there are lots. I have fished sae run brookies my whole life, and they are always right tight to shore. I mean like on the bank tight. I don't see anyone fishing them on lake O."
