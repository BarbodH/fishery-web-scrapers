1053915,Chuck Enwinde,2019-12-20 06:05:00,247, Thanks.Â  Going to stop by in the morning.Â  Really don't like how scarce these are becoming.
1053922,misfish,2019-12-20 12:20:00,29133,"Will check out ours after work. I know I over paid for mine ( Tromblys always over priced ) but they were the only game in town. If they are here,I,ll be buying another pair as back up."
1053941,spooner_jr,2019-12-20 22:13:00,193,"Thanks for the heads up, picked up a pair today.Â  I thought they would be marginally lighter than my Baffins, but these things weigh less than my running shoes.Â  Normally wear a 10, but first tried the 12 because of this thread, and they fit perfect.Â  Came home, went for a walk in the back woods and they are amazing."
1057373,misfish,2020-03-15 21:48:00,29133,"Today was my last day on the hard water . I dedicated my NATS to only ice fishing . I even attached my cleats to them and never took them off. They were part of the boot . Boots were put on once I was ready to go out on the ice . I feel I can give an honest report on these boots. Those that own them already know, they are super light. This was a real positive selling feature for me from the start.Â  Next was comfort . Yes I had to buy 3 sizes up, but once the liner got broke in,they felt like they were 10,s. Even at over size,the boot never made me feel clumsy. Tripping over my feet . Warmth was very surprising . The liner is half the thickness of the baffins, and I never felt a difference . Pull them out after every outing, to dry, the next morning , ready to go.Â Â  For the price,the comfort,warmth and weight, these boots rock.  I highly recommend them.  Time to break out the waders now once again."
1057374,Dutch01,2020-03-15 22:33:00,1431,"I bought a pair of NATS for this season based partly on your advice misfish. IÂ agree with every word -Â super warm, unbelievably light and very comfortable."
1061536,David Chong,2020-05-08 16:18:00,836,Just posted a pair in the Classifieds if anyone is interested!
1078469,Azkaban,2022-02-03 20:56:00,2,"These boots are very comfortable because they do not take the shape of a leg do not stretch. For this reason, it is necessary to buy boots a size larger so that you can put on a warm sock. But in general, the boots are fantastic because do not forget about elasticity and flexural strength. Of course, they are not as comfortable as yeezy sneakers, but this is what you need for fishing. I have been fishing all my life, and during this time, I have worn many different boots. And these were the best. Therefore, believe it or not, if you took them, then you did not lose."
1078480,canoecarrier,2022-02-04 21:10:00,54,"These boots are terrible, they are very stiff in the cold very hard to walk in with their height and stiffness. I bought them for the lightweight and warmth after having heavy baffin titans for years. NATs returned my money which was nice, but these boots are very hard on the feet if you walk long distances. I also get cold feet in them if standing still on the ice. There are some posts of them sucking in water after a period of time. You have to remove the liner each time you put your boot on so if you get snow in your boot its a fun time trying to take the liner off your foot while balancing in the deep snow haha. Insole is cheap cardboard material that is glued down and quickly came loose and folded inside the boots.Â  They do have good tread on them though!"
1078482,misfish,2022-02-04 22:25:00,29133,"Well I do not know what to say about this comment. I have had mine for 4 years now. I bought them for walking in the snow for ice fishing as I am a walker. No issues as you have mentioned. I have nothing but good things to say about them. Never wet feet nor cold feet. Yes,I bought these cause I had baffins that were just to heavy for walking. I still have them (over 10 years old now ) for those days I wish not to wade the rivers or fishing from shore on rainy, muddy days. "
1078702,chris.brock,2022-02-18 01:49:00,4053,"yes, the insoles and liners are poor, but those are cheap to replace I had a 3/4 inch diameter stick go through the sole into my foot but the boot is still waterproof, pulled the stick out and the sole doesn't leak, the material squeezes back together, I wear thin cotton socks and don't get cold"
1078726,akaShag,2022-02-19 13:52:00,2073,"OK you guys have convinced me.Â  Looks like these are $179 now (online). Anybody know if major retailers (CTC, etc) stock them? Doug  PS)Â  Anybody find them TOO WARM?"
1078732,misfish,2022-02-19 17:00:00,29133,"No. Comfortable. All I wear is a pair of HOT socks. That is it. You will want to find a store that sells,so you can make sure you have the right fit Doug."
1078733,misfish,2022-02-19 17:03:00,29133,
1078734,akaShag,2022-02-19 18:03:00,2073,Thanks buddy!
1078736,Garnet,2022-02-19 18:17:00,2056,Couldn't sell my Baffins fast enough.
1078737,misfish,2022-02-19 18:58:00,29133,"I still have mine. If I am getting a ride out,they are ok to use, or fishing a river bank when I do not want to get the waders on. "
1078739,GBW,2022-02-19 22:28:00,8460,Any shop that sell's ATV and Snowmobile products that sell Kimpex dot com supplied items as they are a supplier to get them from.Â  You best try a set on 1st as it's unisex sizing so a runner 10.5 night be an 11 or 12 boot.
1078743,Dara,2022-02-20 13:44:00,3052,"I went to our local Trading Post where they sell them. I was unimpressed. The boot feels like hard plastic in the warm store. I can imagine they would crack at 20 below. Super thick liners and stiff Went back to another store and bought my old standard Acton Prairie boot. Light, flexible and warm. Like wearing bedroom slippersÂ  Been wearing them for fishing etc for 45 years now"
1078751,misfish,2022-02-20 18:32:00,29133,"I get the ""each to their own"". When I first seen them,I was like ,they look cheap and not very well made. After many reviews,I decided to buy them for just the weight of them and the warmth they gave. I have been a fan ever since I got them. I hate wet/cold feet. The thick souls really keep the ice cold getting in. The only thing that is a minus,my buddies tell me I knew you were out,I seen the NATS stamp in the snow. LOL "
1079049,joelynnpamplin,2022-03-08 18:11:00,1,"Hey, I think I saw this model yesterday at my local sportswear shop. I can check the model with you tomorrow when I am near this shop if you need me. Also, I didn't understand why you don't want to buy the model online according to your feet size. I can recommend an awesome online platform with a wide range of sportswear presented on the platform: https://www.grailify.com/en/. Also, you can find a NAT boot model on the platform as well, and if you are struggling with the right size to order pair online, you can always consult with their online customer service."
1051484,Sinker,2019-10-24 20:23:00,8692,"Well, if you need a size 13 to fit your size 10 feet, I""d need size 17.....yikes. "
1051501,PUMP KNOWS,2019-10-25 19:14:00,937,Are these the ones you bought?Â  https://gonats.ca/produit/eva-boots-with-thermal-liner-1590/?lang=en My Baffin Titans had a side tear on the upper on the last day for whities last year.Â  My foot got soaked that day but I kept on fishing.Â  I was thinking of going with Baffins again if I can get them on sale or go with something different that has the same fit/comfort as the Titans. 
1051504,misfish,2019-10-25 19:40:00,29133,"Yes, those are the ones. I,ll be adding screws to them that I have for my wader boots for traction."
1051509,PUMP KNOWS,2019-10-25 23:53:00,937,Thanks
1051789,Garnet,2019-10-31 13:49:00,2056,"Tried to find Nats around Oshawa no luck. Pro Max Range Extremely Light Wieght, -74C/-94 F at Royal Distributing for $100.Â Â Same deal couldn't get my foot in 10 to narrow at ankle ended up with 13. Can't say it's for Chinese market they are made in Poland."
1051800,crappieperchhunter,2019-10-31 20:02:00,2582,Brian I had been putting Â hex headÂ screws in my last pair of winter ice fishing boots for all the years I owned them. Got a pair of baffins last year and the screws just will not stay in them. The rubber is to soft and they work them selves out. I was losing 3-8 screws every time I went out. I think these Nats will have the same problem which is another reason I took a pass on the amigo boots last winter. I think you will end up having to get a good pair of slip on cleats like I did. 
1051803,misfish,2019-10-31 20:05:00,29133,"You know Steve, that is probly a better idea. They will not allow the NATS word, to be in the snow prints. ðŸ¤£"
1051821,David Chong,2019-11-01 13:22:00,836,"Got a pair a few years ago from Angling Outfitters, you definitely need to get a pair a couple of sizes larger than your regular shoe size. Very lightweight!"
1051822,Sinker,2019-11-01 13:25:00,8692,So they are very light because they make them smaller than they say? LOL  I don't get it.  S.
1051826,misfish,2019-11-01 14:04:00,29133,"It,s the boot material it,s self Shane."
1052081,Crackerjack,2019-11-07 11:39:00,34,Seen them at Peterborough cycle salvage for $99. 
1052087,chris.brock,2019-11-07 18:09:00,4053,"I took my Nat's for a hike yesterday, I love'm "
1052106,Chuck Enwinde,2019-11-08 05:15:00,247,I wonder if they Liquidated Minden Bait and Tackle?Â  Â Might Be worth checking out Shane..Â  Brock's feet aren't small.
1052116,Sinker,2019-11-08 16:04:00,8692,I live 10 mins from there. Thanks for the heads up.  S.
1052400,misfish,2019-11-13 21:35:00,29133,"So with the snow the past few days, I decided to start wearing the boots to get them worked in. First thing was the lightness, amazing. Traction,amazing. Warmth,amazing. The boot fits up to the top of my calves. That is an issue. When I got in the truck,I found the top of the boot cuff, interfering with transferring from gas to brake. Put the seat back a bit and it was more comfortable. I do not think I will drive with them on unless I have my bib on which will not allow the cuff to interfere with the motion. Very impressed with them. My feet were toasty warm. Maybe a bit to warm."
1052402,SirCranksalot,2019-11-13 21:55:00,3291,"Much better than Unemployment Boots or goat rubbers, eh> "
1052403,misfish,2019-11-13 22:01:00,29133,"Im off next week. We going to hook up ? I have yet to see the Hippy. Then again, I have been fishing many other spots. Not the best of year so far. Fish are blasting right up with all this high water."
1052404,floater,2019-11-13 22:47:00,220,So I still don't know where to go find these boots near the GTA. Angling outfitters and Royal are my only options?
1052405,misfish,2019-11-13 23:00:00,29133,Peterborough cycle salvage for $99.  Tromblys  I am surprised Sails doesn't have them.
1052414,Chuck Enwinde,2019-11-14 05:19:00,247,"Sail has there own branded EVA foam boots now.Â  I wasn't tempted.Â  And yeah driving with Nats is not recommended.Â  I was backing in to a ramp with them on a few years ago andÂ  as I applied the brakes I could hear the engine revving, apparently the brake wasn't the only thing I was hitting.Â  Lucky I didn't sink the truck."
1052461,misfish,2019-11-14 21:56:00,29133,Just got around to reading the tags.. That is their number one do not do. LMAO
1053787,Tjames09,2019-12-16 13:37:00,664,"I went there for these. You have to order them. They had a boot similar in stock but itâ€™s not the one pictured above. The one they have looks more like a space boot, and I forget the brand."
1053893,pikeyminnow,2019-12-19 18:16:00,18,"I was just in the canadian tire at Whitby, just north of the 401 and they have camoÂ coloured Nats on for 74.99. "

1050946,misfish,2019-10-12 17:46:00,29133,"Anyone seen them for sale, except on line ? I have been told Anglers specialty in Wood Stock sells them,but a bit of a drive. I want to be able to try them on before buying.Â  Size fit. "
1050953,Sinker,2019-10-12 18:09:00,8692,"Their webiste says TSC stores carry them. Some canadian tires, and mr safety shoes. Never noticed them myself. Are they supposed to be good? Better thanÂ  Baffin Titans?  S."
1050954,misfish,2019-10-12 18:14:00,29133,"I was at TSC this morning, not there. The pair alone weigh less then a pound. Rated for -70. I have been a baffin Titan go to guy since I bought my first pair, but need to go light, as I am a walker. Will check out Mr.Safety shoe, as they come to our plant. Thanks Shane."
1051024,Woodsman,2019-10-14 01:33:00,1286,I have a pair of their Muk Lites. Very light and rated to -85C/-118F. I went 2 sizes larger than my normal size. Don't want them tight. Bought in Woodstock.

1051148,Terry,2019-10-16 14:43:00,14456,No. I just saw Two types Baffin boots that look too wide to fit in my bib legs. So I did look any closer

1051430,misfish,2019-10-23 17:24:00,29133,"Well I bought a pair today. And it is a good thing I was able to have hands on for fit. I am a 10 size. The boots that fit best, a size 13. There is about 3/4 space from my toe to the end of the boot. Also all I can say is WOW, you dont even know you have them on.Â  For filtered try again please and giggles,I took the liners out and tried to put the baffin ones in. They fit and the weight is very unnoticeable So if your out ice fishing and see the NAT name in the snow, just follow,you will find me. LMAO."

1051438,misfish,2019-10-23 18:44:00,29133,They do not look like a size 13. They look the same as the size 10 Baffins I have.
1051442,jimmer,2019-10-23 20:23:00,2730,Do you mind if I ask how much you paid for them?
1051443,misfish,2019-10-23 20:30:00,29133,"$129. Baffin Titans are going for the same price, give or take a few bucks and sales. There are places that sell online for $119, but I got to fit and know I was happy with the purchase.  Every time I walk by them, I got to pick them up and it,s just amazing the weight. Bring on the ice season."
1051454,Chuck Enwinde,2019-10-24 04:20:00,247,"Yup.Â  I'm a 10 and wear 13's in Nats.Â  11, and 12 fit but 13 was the most comfortable.Â  I used a generic liner in my first pair for a couple years after the originals were set a little too close to the wood stove to dry - they worked well.  And I usually walk backwards on the way out just in case."
