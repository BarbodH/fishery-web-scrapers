Seems I was a bit late,but was able to help out as much as possible. Got to look over the tables before opening, and knew what I was getting at 10 am. NO SELLING til then, not even the vendors were allowed. This was nice to see.  Man,that David never seems to age. He must lead a real good healthy life. LOL Ran into a couple of ,blast of the past members from here. 1 st guy Stody ( Jamie with his wife ) Never knew he was the owner of True North Baits until a week ago. Seems this is their full time job. He has some real nice baits and what a collection I must say. The plastic is top notch. So soft, yet durable.  I had to grab some to support and try.  The 2nd was UNCLE BUCK ( Goran ) If it was not for his towering frame,I would not of recognized him. Dude has lost some serious weight. He looked great. #1 son had me on the look out for salmon stuff and was able to grab this whole lot for $60. Not a bad savings, I think. Been a long time since I bought this stuff.   I had to treat myself as well, so I picked up a few things. nothing really special.   Gave David a sample of my baits and it looks like I will be tying til the next swap . Going to grab a table next year."
