From what I've read there are lakers, whities, brookies and smallies there. I imagine I'll be spending a few weekends up there this year in btwn my Jacks Lake outtings in Apsley so any info would help.  Colin"

The Oxtongue river flowing in has middling to good brook trout fishing upstream depending on where you look for them.  Best part it's the gateway to Algonquin park. There's a lot of interesting day trips you can do within an easy drive.  Great spot. Your sister and brother in law are very fortunate.
571507,ckrb2007,2011-04-12 17:25:00,449,Thanks for the info. I'll be heading up there this Sunday to help them start to get the place moved in. Going to take the quad up to do some exploring. Looks like a nice spot for sure.
