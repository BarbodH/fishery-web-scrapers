The booth beside the Rice Lake Festival booth was Big Eye Leather. They had some really cool products made from walleye skin which had been tanned into a unique leather. They had gloves, cell phone holders, etc. The people that did find it really, enjoyed the products. I picked up a wallet and business card holder and after a few weeks of use, I love it. The stuff is really durable and good quality. The best part is everytime I show someone my walleye leather wallet, they say the same thing...Your kidding?..  A little pricey but certainly a conversation starter. Apparently you can embroider on the leather as well, maybe a festival logo on a few next year. The guy was very nice and from Manitoba, fish skin comes from commercial fish harvested.  Anyone else pick up these products?"
