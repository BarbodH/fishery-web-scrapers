570356,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-08 22:56:00,0,Circle? Oh you mean the kinda circle that the tragically hip sings about Cocnut cream...lol
570358,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-08 22:57:00,0,  It's to bad Martin died this passed year.
570359,muskymike,2011-04-08 22:59:00,772," A circle which I am not in. I guess i should have said ""Trapezoid"""
570364,Roy,2011-04-08 23:11:00,13728," Yes, I never met him but apparently, from what I read and heard, he was a really good dude."
570372,Skud,2011-04-08 23:30:00,739,"The world record Musky was probably caught in a drag net, chopped up and stuffed in a Pickle Barrel to be shipped to Europe for food 80 years ago. I think I have a picture of the barrel. I will post it when I find it but I am sure somebody will refute my claim."
570424,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-09 02:18:00,4399," I had the pleasure of doing some business with his company and spoke to him on a couple of occassions and I had the same impression Roy that he was a good guy, the first time I was in his office I was in awe of the mounts and pictures. His big fish was a incredible."
570544,ciscokid,2011-04-09 20:33:00,52,"Ken obrien is my uncle, by marriage and while i wasnt even alive at the time he caught it hes told me about it ad I'm sure its all legit. Hes not the type to lie or make something up. I can say with no doubt they're wasting their time trying to disprove it. As for the whole c r thing I'm all for catching and releasing almost any muskie, trophys included but this one was old and barely put up a fight just got slowly hauled to the surface i d say it d probably die if released, and if not it didnt have many more years, if not months ahead of it. I'd have done the same thing."
570587,tonka-toy,2011-04-09 22:48:00,139,"I'd love to hear Ken's opinion of whats going on. I agreed with the questioning of the Lawton and Spray and Johnson fish. This seems as if they used a picture where the ruler is in the foreground and the fish clearly behind it, to question the stated lenghth of the fish.From there I guess the measurement of a mold and mention of a measurement of the actual fish 8 days after it's freezing is in their mind enough to somehow call in and question the record (which is based on weight anyways). With all the apparent eye witnesses agreeing on the stated weight I don't see how they will manage to get this record overturned. (which was the same result as their 2 previous attempts with Spray and Johnson)"
570598,hammercarp,2011-04-09 23:31:00,964,"Us carp guys go through the same stuff you musky guys do. I don't believe anybody can tell the weight of a fish within 20% based on a picture. The Ontario record carp is only 39 lbs. The record gets broken every year but nobody want to go through the hassle or the repercussions of claiming a new record. I have add,that I meant that no dedicated carp angler wants the hassle."
571014,ciscokid,2011-04-11 07:21:00,52," He actually somewhat indifferent about it I'm not sure he even follows the ""investigation"". I mean hes a big fisher and all and I'm sure at the time he was thrilled at the catch but hes not the type to need everyone to know he caught the fish and hes not much of a musky fisher at all, i believe thats the only one he ever caught! lol."
571016,Jewelbee,2011-04-11 08:15:00,422,
571017,Jewelbee,2011-04-11 08:16:00,422,"Wise words, Roy"
569989,perchslayer666,2011-04-07 19:33:00,280,"If I ever catch a record Ski, for sure I'm keeping it, and I'm going to be famous. You can all gawk at the pictures, shake my hand at the fishing shows and be jealous all you want. I'll be hood-rich and be hanging out with Miriko Izumi."
569991,Mike Pike,2011-04-07 19:40:00,1332,"You'll only be famous amongst other fisherman, which doesn't really make you famous. You won't get rich because companies don't throw money at you just cuz you caught a big muskie. And you don't stand a chance with Mariko. SO LET THE FISH GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ...lol"
570004,addy79,2011-04-07 20:50:00,573, babahhahahahahaha AWESOME!
570005,F7Firecat,2011-04-07 20:50:00,347,Maybe they should have shoved a garden HOSE down that fish and filled it with water....
570029,Jigger,2011-04-07 22:31:00,1237," You've been giving the same ambiguous statement for years, gb. Like other guys, I didn't catch it and don't give a rats about the record. But your responses to these threads suck. ""I know the truth and one day it shall be revealed..."" OOOHHH so mysterious. We only have until Dec.21st of next year apparently, so why not do everyone the favour of solving this mind trap once and for all?"
570033,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-07 22:45:00,0,  lol. Ambiguos is good eh...  I'll let the die hards tell the tail. No one would believe me.
570045,BillM,2011-04-07 23:32:00,17367," Roy, it's funny you say that.  I have a buddy who's been involved in the muskie game for a long long time.  He's told me more records have been caught and released then people even know.  I've seen some pics of him with a certain other muskie legend and could not believe the size of the fish they had..  If it were ever posted (and it never will be) it would blow peoples minds!!"
570178,carp-starter,2011-04-08 05:09:00,253,"Check the web site (I found it in 2009) below for:  “Albert McReynolds - His Story Setting the record straight”  After reading his story, I do not know why anyone would want reveal that he caught a record fish. I think that the previous record holder also had problems.  It is not worth it. But then I do not keep fish. I do the C & R bit. It would be a shame to have to kill a record fish for some glory and many negatives.  http://stripers247.com/Almcreynoldsrecordstriper.php  carp-starter  – some want to become famous, eh?"
570311,Ron,2011-04-08 20:58:00,1683,"AS far as I'm concerned, every record Muskie will be discredited until one of the Big shot Muskie Gooroos catches a record fish. Heaven forbid a pickerel fisherman caught a record Muskie!  (There, I said it, now that made me feel better.)  Cheers, Ron..."
570314,solopaddler,2011-04-08 21:10:00,8605,"  There's no doubt our mutual friend has caught ridiculous numbers of large fish. Lazarus is maybe the only other guy I know of who's caught more.  However, knowing him like I do, there's no way he'd ever release a record. Never."
570317,Roy,2011-04-08 21:12:00,13728," Are you talking Marc or Mike here, Mike?"
570319,solopaddler,2011-04-08 21:19:00,8605," Isn't there just one Lazarus?  My friend is largely unknown, he shuns any type of spotlight."
570321,Roy,2011-04-08 21:22:00,13728," You're right in that he's low key however, Mike would not keep a record. Neither Mike nor Marc need nor want a hanger. That, I would bank on."
570323,solopaddler,2011-04-08 21:28:00,8605," I'm not talking about either Marc Thorpe or Mike Lazarus Roy, I'm talking about my friend. I said Lazarus was the only other guy I know who may have caught as many.  As I said earlier he's caught ridiculous amounts of large fish and if he caught a record he would keep it."
570326,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-08 21:36:00,0,  That would only make sense cause the majority do not care or read internet fishing forums in the first place. Lots of Ken Obrien's around I'm sure.
570329,irishfield,2011-04-08 21:42:00,26272,I was thinking it's over 2 months to season and I'm already looking for my rubber boots....
570332,Roy,2011-04-08 21:53:00,13728,"Sorry Mike, I misunderstood your post. As for you friend, where does he fish mostly?"
570336,solopaddler,2011-04-08 22:11:00,8605, Georgian Bay mostly Roy.
570342,muskymike,2011-04-08 22:30:00,772," August 27, 2008. I am sure you and Roy got to see it. Terry was pissed at me for taking it down...  Roy, you are correct, let it slip back into the depths....its NOT worth it at all"
570344,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-08 22:33:00,0,  You're right there!!! Making up stories of how it went down is like looking through a piece of glass.
570345,muskymike,2011-04-08 22:35:00,772," Unknown to the public, very well known in the circle..."
570347,solopaddler,2011-04-08 22:46:00,8605, I think I need to edit my post so it's more clear LOL!
570348,esoxansteel,2011-04-08 22:48:00,1307,"  Your right their Ron, unless they discredit enough Canadian fish, that it finally ends up back in Wisconsin, where they want it in the first place, Martin Williamsons will be next, and then mine after that"
570349,muskymike,2011-04-08 22:50:00,772," Haha no need, those that understand, understand, those that don't, fish for Bass!!!"

569853,tonka-toy,2011-04-07 03:20:00,139,"Some of the Muskie boards are abuzz with a challenge of the canadian record fish.Maybe someone younger and smarter could link or post or paste?(wife and kids have gone to bed)If all three of the fish were disqualified,what would the next fish be?"
569872,lew,2011-04-07 08:18:00,12766,"I think if people stopped worrying so much about who caught the biggest fish, they'd have more time to enjoy fishin'"
569874,Terry,2011-04-07 09:18:00,14456,yeah  I wish there was no need for records of who gets the big fish..then there would be no lies  but there is so lets catch the guys trying to commit fraud and take away their records  or make it even harder to get a record.......
569877,Roy,2011-04-07 10:56:00,13728,"If you were to luck into a record muskie, you'd be wise to let her slip back down to the depths. Sure take a pic and measure if you can but let her go. Unless you really need the notoriety and the few dollars, it really is not worth it. Regardless of how honest you were, from that time on, your integrity would be questioned forever. It's like any other sport or pastime, as soon as money/greed enter the equation, it's dead."
569878,lew,2011-04-07 11:06:00,12766,"And you definetely don't want to ever post the pictures on the internet cause all the so-called ""experts"" will tear you apart."
569884,OhioFisherman,2011-04-07 12:04:00,6623,"Pictures of them record size fish sort of shoots the old adage "" a picture is worth a thousand words "" dead in the azz. A picture now seems to start a million questions.  I was always able to find better things to do with my time than worry about people believing my fish stories!   Maybe they will require the fish to produce a birth certificate?"
569885,Billy Bob,2011-04-07 12:05:00,5865,"Even before opening up this thread I wondered if all these records are worth it...  Roy, I REALLY see your point....my old fishing partner's father had a saying when anyone started to brag about the fish he ""may"" have caught and it went something like this ""All fishermen are liars except You and Me and I have my doubts about You""....great line to use when the bull is flying."
569886,umKthxbye,2011-04-07 12:13:00,247, I like that lol.
569893,Cast-Away,2011-04-07 12:42:00,790,Ho can anyone dispute this? Look at the photo:  
569896,Mike Pike,2011-04-07 12:54:00,1332,So true Paul!

569909,umKthxbye,2011-04-07 14:16:00,247, Could have been a guy holding a kid or his girlfriend an some one photoshoped a musky lol.
569915,Nipfisher,2011-04-07 14:56:00,2449, I think they whitened the anglers teeth too  . Photoshop is lame.
569916,Nipfisher,2011-04-07 15:05:00,2449, Maybe this has something to do wit it? This is from my grandpa's place. He was not a drinker and this cup held toothpicks. It is called the Fisherman's Nite Cap    
569918,TJQ,2011-04-07 15:10:00,7806,The guy is only 4 feet tall!!  
569926,chris.brock,2011-04-07 15:37:00,4053,"I know it's been said before, but it would be pretty hard to budge that fish on 8lb mono and pretty lucky not to get bitten off with a 4"" rapala  A buddy hooked what we assumed was a sturgeon on the French, with 10lb mono all he could do was slowly bring the fish up off bottom and then watch as it slowly peeled line for awhile only to settle back down on bottom, he had to give up after an hour and a half and 2 liters of blood gone to the mosquitos"
569927,glen,2011-04-07 15:40:00,2641,"""Some of the Muskie boards are abuzz with a challenge of the canadian record fish.""   And the challenge will go something like this.  In this picture this fish looks way smaller then this other picture of this fish.  So the one with the best picture wins. Nice work."
569942,Crazy Ivan,2011-04-07 16:39:00,184, I don't think photoshop was around in 1988?
569943,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-07 16:51:00,0,There's a lot more to it than any fish picture will tell. Finally someone may have let the cat out of the bag and put this story to rest. A lot of people should be ashamed. Lots have been fooled.
569944,cram,2011-04-07 17:01:00,1733, What's the story?
569946,Roy,2011-04-07 17:07:00,13728," That's exactly it. There are facts in most of these stories that have never been told, shown or proven in public. Just keep an open mind without criticizing the current record holders 'til some of these stories get debunked. Personally, aside from my curiosity, I have no stake in the outcome nor do I care."
569947,jjcanoe,2011-04-07 17:13:00,744, photoshop was the best selling software in 1986 wasn't it????????
569948,Billy Bob,2011-04-07 17:15:00,5865," I can't agree more no matter what kind of record fish it may or may not be....  Bottom line if I didn't catch it, it doesn't matter to me...and perch taste better anyways.."
569954,glen,2011-04-07 17:37:00,2641,"""Taking measurements from the image with O’Brien I get 52.3” +/- 1”."" http://worldmuskiealliance.com/WMA_OBrien_Summary_Report.pdf  The picture they use for this measurement has the fish hanging with the gills cut.  They say nothing about the cut gills though.  Take off 2""-4"" for the cut gills.  These people cant measure anything."
569956,Roy,2011-04-07 17:39:00,13728,Here we go again.
