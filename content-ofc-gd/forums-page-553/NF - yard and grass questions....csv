571472,4x4bassin,2011-04-12 15:40:00,1025,"The easiest way to get those driveway weeds out is with round up spray that you can ""still buy"" at CDN Tire . Round up is a ""non selective"" herbicide which means it will kill everything that is growing for a long time, the selective herbicide which means that it is weed selective like the old weed and feed and killex (weed killer)is no longer available in Ontario. So if you use the round up be very carefull around the lawn and gardens and don't spray on a windy day ! This will work for you. As for your lawn I would start with a core aeration and then some good triple mix top dressing and rake the soil in good (not to much soil that will cover the exsisting grass)You will be surprised at what just doing this will do for your lawn ! I would do this as soon as possible so the spring rains do alot of the work for you by soaking in the new soil to your old soil.Come the begining of May put down some fertilizer like a 32-5-10 or something in that range .The higher the first number the higher the nitrogen content meaning better grass blade and a greener lawn , a good way to understand the meaning of these numbers is ""Up,Down,All Around"" Up first number makes grass grow good and makes it green,Down means root growth and All Around means grass grows out and spreads. Like other people have said and the most important thing is don't cut lawn too short 3"" is good , you might cut a little more but it is better for the grass and the long grass keeps the root bed cool and moist and as well the weed seeds can't germinate under the shadow of the long grass.Keep clippings on grass , these provide nitrogen for your lawn as they decompose , free nitrogen is good ! Oh ya one more thing keep blades on mower sharp . The best time of year to seed your lawn is in September when you get cool nights and warm days and the weeds are not growing anymore and competing with your seed but you can seed now it's just not the best time of year for that ! A little info on grass seeding is that a grass seed is sorta shaped like a square and three sides of the four have to be touching soil to germinate so raking in the seed is important as well as being moist. Soil temperature have to be around 15 degrees C for good germination too , somthing like finding that magic 52 degree F for lakers (had to throw that in there) Hopefully this helps and if you have any more question feel free to PM me ! Cheers Dave"
571491,ckrb2007,2011-04-12 16:47:00,449,"I, like BillM, live in Barrie which is a huge sand bed! Very tough to hold the water/moisture. I always lay down a few bags of peat moss mixed with top soil a few times a year, fertilize several times and over seed my lawn with quality seed throughout year. I don't water excessively because watering just enough, from what I've read, will make the roots go deeper as opposed to spreading out close to the surface if you constantly water. Multiple beers and conversing with the neighbours while watching the grass grown seems to work for me as well.  Cheers,  Colin"

571547,Vtucciarone,2011-04-12 20:11:00,38,"Another solution to the weeds growing through the cracks, is to boil water in your kettle and pour it onto the weeds. My wife does this and it works really well."

571301,pikehunter,2011-04-12 01:00:00,1659,"Answer to the first question: Rottotiller, top soil and new sod. Then never ever cut your lawn short always 2 1/2 to 3 inches longer the better to keep the weeds at bay and Scott's fertilizer.  Second question: Weedeater held on edge and whack the crap out of them or buy some vegatation killer."
571302,HTHM,2011-04-12 01:02:00,4082,"Your front lawn has what appears to be snow mold or chinch bugs. To check, at the edge of the dead spot take a sample of the turf including the root zone, place in a pail of water. If the bugs float up to the top, there is your answer. You will need to apply a insecticide to deal with that. If not, then you need to apply a fungicide, and topdress and overseed the affected areas. To really green it up, rent a de-thatcher and go over it with that. As that process can be done very quickly, go in with a neighbour or two on the rental to cut costs. As for the driveway, round up. Now banned for public use, so the alternate is a weedwhip on an angle weekly."
571303,bigugli,2011-04-12 01:05:00,6138,"To start with, you should consider dethatching and aerating the lawn. Keeping things simple, get a DIY fertilizer program from your garden centre. Garden Gallery, Sheridans. Scotts, all have recommended programs and timetables for lawn maintenace through the season. Each component works on different elements of the lawn during the season. Lawn starter, weed and feed, root developer, winter feed, etc... As for the grass growing past the border. Grass spreads by sending out root colonies. You can never eliminate it, only control. Reccomendations depend upon local spray regulations. There are lots of name brand contact weed killers. If they are banned in your area, the controls include digging them out, bleach, vinegar. I could not make more specific suggestions without actually seeing the condition of the sod."
571304,GBW,2011-04-12 01:08:00,8460,"I find aeration helps followed by a lot of soil and seed.  get a good brand of seed and fertilizer.  the higher the 1st # is means greener as it is the nitrogen (I think).  Weeds, get a spray and soak the hell out of them and hope you don't get your grass as it will kill it too if you do."
571309,solopaddler,2011-04-12 01:16:00,8605,"Ryan you think I have lots of time to fish?  I'll be completely landscaping my front yard this spring. Replacing the sod, creating a huge bed with curved borders and all new planting, removing a maple tree and creating a new bed where it was with new planting, installing a decorative octagonal shaped window in the peak of the house, laying porcelain tile on my concrete porch, installing a railing around the porch. And lastly, this is not front yard, but planting several hundred cedars in my backyard to create a hedge.  Wanna trade lists?   Anyhow unlike my front lawn which is all weeds and must be rototilled, levelled with topsoil and new sod laid, yours doesn't look as bad.  Personally I'd use seed.  Scratch the surface where it'll be sown. Apply the seed liberally along with a good starter fertilizer then TOPDRESS with about an inch of quality topsoil.  The topsoil helps the seed germinate and grow and protects it from birds that'll eat it.  Water like crazy and you'll be amazed at the result.  As far as the weeds in the driveway goes you can try and fill the cracks with tar and driveway sealer.  Otherwise weedkiller and a weed whacker are your best friend."
571312,solopaddler,2011-04-12 01:19:00,8605," Yeah, the damage done by the cinch bugs is usually circular.  You'll have to eliminate the problem before you fix the damage."

571371,chessy,2011-04-12 03:17:00,610,"Firstof all you don't appear to have shrubs near by so that more than likely rulesout whit grubs. You have a little moon scapeing, which might be some chinchbugs. But you don't have to worry about them till the heat of the summer. Firstget together with a few of your neighbors and rent a core aerator and make sureit is a core aerator. When you do your lawn you will have plugs that come upabout 3-4 inches long leave them on the lawn, yes they look like tiny dog poobut they thatch layer in those plugs will help fertilize your lawn. Next youhave two choices put down grass seed so it makes contact with the open holes inthe ground if you choose to do that you cannot put down fertilizer, as it willburn the new shoots when the seed germinate. Next step (put your wheels back onyour lawn mower) make sure your mower is 2.5 inches min from the ground to yourblade of your lawnmower don't go by what the wheels say physically measure yourheight. And don't change it yes it will look long till they grass becomes thesame height but this will make your lawn grow thicker. Forever inch of grassyou have you have the same amount of grass root, which sends, new shoots ofgrass to the surface, will keep your lawn from drying out in the summer months.Next step is to keep your lawn watered about a inch of water a week, now thisis where it gets tricky and people will freak never ever water your lawn atnight, your lawn must be dry as possible going into the night time mold willform. Water your lawn early am or in the middle of the day if you have to ITWILL NOT BURN the most damage is done in the heat of the day if you can keepyour lawn damp during the day your lawn will cool and the roots will survive. Waterand height of grass you will see a difference in no time. A good   19 1919 fertilizer that is slow release will help three times a year. And if you andyour neighbors get together 2 times fall and spring aeration is the best thingyou can do... as far as the grass in the drive way good old gylosphos will killit (gylosophos) is the active ingredient in round up. Round up is just a tradename there is cheaper and better out there but it will kill all grasses soshould only be used to kill everything it touches.  Hope this helps as Idid lawn care for 7 years and hold land class 1 and 3 tickets for chemical applications. "

As for a little more in depth info: I've already blown my budget trying to finish my basement....   And it's not even close to being done yet... I had the drywall nearly finished then the basement started leaking so I had to back-track and get it waterproofed...   so this has to cost me as little as possible... This is what most of my basement looks like now..       So options like re-sodding the entire front yard isn't an option for me...  I'm  thinking more along the lines of the airating the lawn and putting seeds down/waterering etc? Cheapest option to just make it look a little better? I don't even know what kind of seeds and so on... still have to read through the previous posts more thoroughly though....   As for the weeds in my driveway... I have 2 giant paved driveways and it takes me forever to weed-eat it and rake up the weeds... ultimately weed-eating into my fishing time    So I'm wondering about digging out the weeds and filling the cracks with tar or something???
