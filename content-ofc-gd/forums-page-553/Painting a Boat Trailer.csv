570448,glen,2011-04-09 03:43:00,2641,Tremclad.
570471,blue pickeral,2011-04-09 09:50:00,267,There's a guy near Magnetawan that sandblasts and paints boat trailers for $350.00. After blasting he uses 3 coats of Tremclad.
570597,Twocoda,2011-04-09 23:24:00,4130,should you choose to do it properly...NO TREMCLAD !  Two coats of PPG DP40 (rust inhibitor primer) Then top coat it with and automotive paint of your choice
570599,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-09 23:36:00,10439,Or if you want it bullet proof and never have to paint it again use Rhino Liner (you can get it tinted different colours).
570614,BFSC Kevin,2011-04-10 00:37:00,1351, LOL. wow.
570624,Crazy Ivan,2011-04-10 01:01:00,184, I would agree that this would be best.
570662,jedimaster,2011-04-10 02:11:00,3472,Best paint by far is por15. It'll last forever. Other than that tremclad is actually very durable paint and if you think it mineral spirits and roll it on with a foam roller it'll come out awesome.
570999,brifishrgy,2011-04-11 03:56:00,559,"if it isnt too bad I would leave it be, fresh paint could make the buyer think that something is being hidden"
571029,SlowPoke,2011-04-11 11:16:00,2984,Amazing stuff but needs to be trated with a UV coat for long term aesthetics.  Good point.
571043,jedimaster,2011-04-11 12:25:00,3472,"True about the UV, but for a trailer, I would think durability is number 1. Just like a subframe of a car.  Honestly though tremclad is not that bad. The paint is actually very strong and durable and given the right technique it can give an excellent finish. Plus touchups are fast and easy. Grab a pint of gloss white, some mineral spirits thin it down a bit, grab some foam rollers, and wet sand between the coats with 600 grit wet/dry. No need to prime but get rid of the rust if possible. and go over the whole things with 100 grit sand paper before the first coat.  This car was painted with tremclad... I would say good enough for a trailer.    Look for the reply by 69chargeryeeha  about 1/3 the way down."
