570026,moemoe,2011-04-07 22:27:00,352,"Hey guys, looking for some info, opinions, I was interested in a 2004 lund tyee 1950 from the US, I was going to drive down this weekend to have look, the motor is a 225 yamaha, as well as kicker, the issue is that trailer is only a single anxle and If purchased would driving approx 16hours to pick it up, Would a single axle carry the weight? Should I be worried?"
570028,irishfield,2011-04-07 22:30:00,26272,Sounds light.. I sure wouldn't want my 2150 on a single axle trailer.
570030,skeeter,2011-04-07 22:33:00,1907,Call the seller and ask what the rating is on the trailer and what the boat weighs complete. Is it the original trailer that the dealer sold it on?
570032,Terry,2011-04-07 22:36:00,14456,"I had a 19ft glass bass boat DC with a 150 on a single and it was more then fine  is it what it is sitting on or is it what you want to take down there to put it on   cause if it is what it is sitting on it, you would think it would be ok....1 hr drive or 16 hrs I don't see much difference"
570034,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-07 22:48:00,0,Nice upgrade Moe. Seems a little on the small side. Last Tyee I saw for sale had a tandem.
570035,Grimace,2011-04-07 22:53:00,2020,I just googled Lund Tyee 1950.  Clicked on images and all the pictures  on a trailer show dual axle.  I know that doesn't tell you for sure if a single can pull it off but it would certainly suggest that a dual axle would be optimum.
570061,danbouck,2011-04-08 00:23:00,4380,"Googled 2004 lund tyee 1950 and half are on single axle, it should be fine"
570063,SlowPoke,2011-04-08 00:30:00,2984,"No need to worry about the single axle in terms of capacity. Having said that, you would greatly benefit from another axle for breaking power. If you have a good tow vehicle, it won't be an issue."
570064,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-04-08 00:30:00,1107,The 2011 I stood in at the show was on the exact same trailer as my 1825 rebel I think you will be fine but def check what the dry weight of the boat is and make sure the trailer is rated for that and the weight of motors and gas + for gear
570310,Ron,2011-04-08 20:51:00,1683,"As others have stated, find out the weight of the boat and then see if the seller can tell you the size of axle on the trailer. If the boat weighs 4000 lbs for an example, the axle under the trailer should be 7000 lb rating. This will give you the buffer for added gear, fuel, etc."
570330,Tybo,2011-04-08 21:45:00,1373,If It's the right tailor for the boat. you'll have no problems.
570334,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-08 22:04:00,10439,The guy I bought my new Minnkota off took it off his Tyee 1950 and his boat was on a single axle trailer and he towed it from Ontario to YK. If it is the original that came with the boat package you'll be ok. I would be repcaking the bearings before starting the journey home though. You really don't know their condition until you pull the hubs so do that at least.
571131,bigbuck,2011-04-11 17:14:00,2449,"If the boat came on that trailer, you should be ok. My 19 ft Larson Fish'n'ski is a big heavy boat on a single axle trailer and probably outweighs that Tyee by 500lbs. Like mentioned above, repack the bearings."
571388,moemoe,2011-04-12 08:09:00,352,"Made home just fine, the trailer is rated for 6000lbs, the boat weighs 1875 dry, no gear and motors are approx 700lbs, so I think It won't be a problem"
571401,Fish Farmer,2011-04-12 11:11:00,2234,"The only downside with a double axle is moving around by hand, you can't turn. Oh and now you have 4 tires to change and more maintenance"
571586,lew,2011-04-12 22:41:00,12766,"When I bought the new Skeeter 2 years ago it came on an excellent custom trailer manufactured by EZ Loader. It's got a swing away tongue, torsion axle, surge brakes, LED lights and  the upgraded aluminum wheels.  Only problem is, it's a single axle and with my heavy glass boat I just never really felt comfortable with it. The boat certainly falls within the load range of the trailer but I just wasn't happy with it.  Today, I ordered a new traler with tandem axles and I'm now gonna feel much more comfortable on the long hiway trips I take several times a year hauling the boat. Again it's gonna be custom built to fit my hull exactly and has the same features as the single axle, with swing away tongue, surge disc brakes and upgraded wheels, but it's also gonna be painted to match the boat including pin striping.  I'll get it in about 4 weeks and should enjoy the long trips much better now knowing I've got nearly twice the carrying capacity under the boat, plus if a tire blows it'll be much more stabil until I get it stopped.  Here's the current single axle.  "
