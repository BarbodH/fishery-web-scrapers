570859,zman,2011-04-10 22:37:00,179,Is it normal when you pull the drain plug to have water come out ?
570860,mrpike,2011-04-10 22:42:00,151,  WHAT drain plug / on your boat or your motor   	MOTOR NO   BOAT SOMETIMES  IF IT RAINS OR SOME COMES FROM RUNNING AROUND HARD  SOMETIMES YOU GET SOME BACK WASH OVER THE BACK OF THE BOAT.
570862,skeeter,2011-04-10 22:47:00,1907,Condensation build up inside the boat. Dew. It can all build up.
570866,Fisherman,2011-04-10 22:57:00,7201,"A little bit from minnow bucket spillage or rain but that's about it for me.  If it's from the overnight dew, it usually drys up by the afternoon."
570867,HTHM,2011-04-10 23:00:00,4082,Yes
570872,smally21,2011-04-10 23:24:00,993,"yes, i usually pull it half way up the ramp, rain, waves, etc."
570875,skeeter,2011-04-10 23:29:00,1907,"Im surprised no one has answered, Well thats what its there for."
570879,zman,2011-04-10 23:35:00,179,Yes it is the drain plug I went fishing on Saturday on the niagara River and I was surprised at the ammount of water coming out after I pulled the plug
570881,dave524,2011-04-10 23:35:00,4508,"On a day like today when the air temps are fairly warm and the water temp is 40F if you are lucky, you'd be surprised how much condensation you will get in an aluminum boat."
570883,zman,2011-04-10 23:37:00,179,"I looked uder the hull and didn't see any cracks, I was surprised at the amount that came out"
570884,zman,2011-04-10 23:38:00,179,It was empty before we started the day
570899,mrpike,2011-04-10 23:58:00,151, IF you have a livewell on board.  Maybe you should check the livewell make sure there is no damage to the livewell tank and also check all water lines from the rear to the livewell . sometimes you get a leak on a line at a clap or joint  also check the intake holes  and seals on the back of the boat . I hope it all works out for the good for you.
570919,nofish4me,2011-04-11 00:45:00,404,"No idea what kind of boat you have, but any access in transom area should have a seal of some sort. Look to make sure no ""o"" rings are missing, make sure that any live well piping isn't leaking, etc.."
570937,mukluk,2011-04-11 01:36:00,196,Might want to check the bilge pump for leaks. Sometimes water gets trapped in the pump and freezes during winter storage and warps pump seals then leaks into boat in summer.
570950,landry,2011-04-11 01:53:00,1005,"How much???? That is the big question.  If it is a lot you may have a problem. It will most likely be a leaky hose, pump... It could be leaky rivets/seam but it is probably something small. I suddenly started to get water in my boat so I plugged up my livewell intake  = no water. I had a split hose and replaced it.  And yes, there will always be moisture and backsplashing too.  My first, old aluminum leaked slowly through the seams - it wasn't unsafe, just annoying. I bought this moldable aluminum puddy at a marine dealer and pressed it into all of the seams. It took forever but totally fixed the problem.  Landry"
