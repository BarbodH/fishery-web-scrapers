571150,Terry,2011-04-11 18:39:00,14456,well the simple answer is yes  I was at the mouth of the trent canal on simcoe in the spring  I thought I would be fishing from shore..but I ended up walking out on the ice only about 4 ft from shore and I was casting to open water and had a set line out with a minnow..the CO that showed up said he could charge me..I told him I was ice fishing and it states 2 lines he said open water  I said I was standing on the water in the form of ice so ice fishing and I told him I see lots of people in the winter fishing pressure crack( open water how many has he charged for that ..he gave me a hard time in the end I told him to drop dead..charge me or piss off I didn't need to hear his crap..he left..........os I guess it's ok to to do it
571185,irishfield,2011-04-11 20:22:00,26272,Terry.. an upstanding fellow like you would never talk to a man of authority that way.....  
571189,Terry,2011-04-11 20:27:00,14456,you are right Wayne    I toned it down so my post would make it by the swear GODs....   what I really said was....I had better not...
571190,jedimaster,2011-04-11 20:29:00,3472,haha thats funny. So what if its in the middle of summer and I make an iceberg from my chest freezer and float it into the middle of the lake with a little bow mount trolling motor for power? I bet it would last at least a few hours before melting.... 
571191,Terry,2011-04-11 20:30:00,14456,"works for me, make it big enough for 2 and I will join you......LOL"
571337,John Bacon,2011-04-12 01:48:00,3277,Don't you have to be fishing through the ice to use two lines?
571341,Terry,2011-04-12 01:52:00,14456, if you are standing on ice are you not doing just that  again  I have seen many people fishing with two line fishing a pressure crack that has opened 30/40 ft wide and miles long..are you fishing through the ice.... well you are ice fishing
571355,Sinker,2011-04-12 02:15:00,8692,"Is there a proper definition for icefishing?? I've never looked, and I couldn't be bothered right now. A lot of the time, I only use one line thru the ice anyways.  S."
