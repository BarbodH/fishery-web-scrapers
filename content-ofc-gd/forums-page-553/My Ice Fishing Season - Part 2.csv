570536,trapshooter,2011-04-09 20:03:00,1234,"The ice fishing season is winding down in NW Ontario so I thought it was time to get caught up with a report of the second half of my season. Overall it was one of he best years on the ice for me.  I spent more time chasing lakers this year.  I'm the kind of fisherman who would rather catch 1 or 2 big fish then 20 or 50 panfish.  So lakers fit the bill and they're a good winter substitute for muskies too.  Of course I still love walleye and the late ice bite didn't disappoint.  Fishing in 25-30' for walleye during late ice you never know what you're going to catch.  Smallies, pike, trout, whitefish, burbot.  It's a fun time of year on the ice up here.  I'll let the pictures do the talking.  Enjoy!              This next guy isn't the longest trout I've caught but look at how thick it is!          Pretty fun to crack a PB through the ice. 20"" smallmouth.             Double header trout with my buddy Colin.  We were both fishing for walleye with Lindy Darters so this was a real coincidence/bonus!              "

570569,trapshooter,2011-04-09 22:13:00,1234,"If he's the guy at Slate Falls, then yes.  They keep a few planes on ski's on the ice down there and it's a busy float plane base in the summer."
