571408,super dave,2011-04-12 11:52:00,323,Hi everyone.  This is not fishing related but I'll throw it out there.  It seems my ac just conked out.  When I turn it on I don't hear the ac engine/ compressor going anymore and no diff in air temp coming out.  Does anyone shed some light on possible problem(s)?  Does anyone know a good treasonable priced ac repairman? Thanks everyone in advance. Dave

It's really not something you can check for yourself as there are specialized tools needed. Hopefully it's something small."
571511,super dave,2011-04-12 17:42:00,323,  Hey Skeeter.  If you could locate that flyer for me that would be great.  Otherwise I'll check out some local shops.  Thanks for the replies Skeeter and BB.
