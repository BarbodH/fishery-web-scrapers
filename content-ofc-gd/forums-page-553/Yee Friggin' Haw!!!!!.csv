571039,NAW,2011-04-11 12:13:00,4022,Wouldn't want that landing on my head..  Anyone catch Canada in the Rough this weekend.  Pigeon getting smashed in the face with that snow goose was hillarious!!
571040,Fish Farmer,2011-04-11 12:14:00,2234,"That was great, gave me the feeling I was rigging Rainbow in Lake O"

571053,Kingsalmon,2011-04-11 12:52:00,107,That jumping is simply amazing.  Can you imagine that thing on a float rod?  Lets stock Mako's in Lake Ontario!
571113,umKthxbye,2011-04-11 16:15:00,247,"Was that the same one jumping, or a bunch? That was some good hight."
571114,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-11 16:22:00,10439," The same one, it was hooked up. It finally ended up landing on the line during the last jump and snapped off."
571132,backbay,2011-04-11 17:16:00,773,"Craziest, most unreal thing ever!"

571256,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-11 23:38:00,10439, Imagine that thing landing in the boat!!!
571470,Headhunter,2011-04-12 15:38:00,5703,Oh my... but does that look like fun!!!!! HH
571496,Dozer,2011-04-12 16:57:00,896,"That looks dangerous, I'd hate for that Mako to somersault into the damn boat.  Wicked video!"
