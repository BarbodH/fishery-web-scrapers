When Bennett's favorite hockey team, the Albany River Rats, a farm team for the Carolina Hurricanes, was moved to Charlotte, N.C., to become the Charlotte Checkers, Zach wanted to move with it. Zach's family discovered that a Charlotte medical center offered specialized treatment for his disease, so they decided to put their house on the market and make the move.  But the real estate market did not cooperate with the Bennetts' plans, and for the past few months they have been in Albany waiting for a seller so they could finally move the entire family to Charlotte.    On Friday night, the Charlotte Checkers decided their biggest fan and ""brother"" shouldn't have to wait any longer.  Before their game at the Time Warner Arena, they presented the Bennetts with keys to a new house in nearby Matthews, S.C.  ""The bond between Zach and our players is like nothing I have ever seen,"" said Checkers COO Tera Black on the Checkers website. ""To be able to help reunite him with his friends and teammates is something we as an organization are truly proud of.""  The team held fundraisers, auctions and an online Facebook campaign to raise money to purchase the three-bedroom, ranch-style home in Matthews for the Bennetts.  After the home was purchased, several partners of the Checkers donated labor and materials to make the house handicap-accessible. A local builder, Timberstone Homes, volunteered time and led the reconstruction efforts, completely refitting the home to fit the family's needs.  ""The Charlotte organization put the wheels in motion, and to see it come together is just fantastic,"" Checkers player Brad Herauf said in a video of the joyous moment when the team welcomed the Bennetts to their new home.  And the Bennetts caught a much-deserved lucky break when they finally sold their old home within days of the Checkers' purchasing them a new one.  Now Zach and his family have a chance at a new beginning in their new home close to the team and players that he loves.  ""Yeah, I want to live down here forever,"" Zach said. ""This is my new home."""
