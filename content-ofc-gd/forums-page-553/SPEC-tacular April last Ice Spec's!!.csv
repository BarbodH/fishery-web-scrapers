Was N.W of Ottawa and we had to ATV in approx 25km's from the cottage we stayed at...enjoyed awesome weather, amazing shorelunch, wildlife including a Moose on the trail coming out.... oh ya.. and a few nice Specs too!  All fish were taken in 3 to 7' of water with worm tipped spoons and just a worm and split shot rig. Looking forward to getting back up in the next 2-3 weeks for a softwater trip      Be safe and Good Fish'n!... Greg."
