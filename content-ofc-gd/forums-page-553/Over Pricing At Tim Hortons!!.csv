566903,Billy Bob,2011-03-28 18:36:00,5865, So that's why their dognuts suck....
566914,Joey,2011-03-28 19:23:00,9122,My friend from BC emailed me this the other day:  
566929,Billy Bob,2011-03-28 19:39:00,5865,"Hell, that beat waiting inline for your surgery any day of the week..."
566930,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-28 19:43:00,2582, I have found the exact opposite it the few Timmies I used to frequent. Totally inconsistant...which was my main motivator to try McD's coffee...which I have found 100% consistant in all locations in the 2 years since I switched.  Tell me the McD's you tried coffee at and I'll do my best to avoid them
566978,BillM,2011-03-28 22:15:00,17367, 400 South @ Hwy 89..  I guess I got lucky with my Tim Hortons.  I however have found massive differences between the Timmys up here and the ones closer to the big smoke.  The one little drivethru located on the 400NB just past Major Mac is probably the worst out of all of them.  I've NEVER had a good coffee from that place.  I have a feeling they aren't brewing a new batch every 15 mins in order to save $$$..  But that's all speculation.
567174,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-29 09:39:00,2582," I have noticed that as well at Timmies. A coffee up in Cottage country quite often seems better. I just always thought it was because the water was better then city water. I however have not noticed that difference in McD's coffee so that shot down my ""water"" theory."
567182,mercman,2011-03-29 11:40:00,7054,"personally,i never ever drink restaurant coffee anymore.Either too week, or too strong.I have never had a cup of good coffee in any restaurant in the past.Specialty shops like Starbucks,or second cup,are the only ones i may drink coffee from.They seem to concentrate more on their coffee than their food menu."
567207,Governator,2011-03-29 13:04:00,879,"  I agree Bill, being a self-admitted mcdonalds lover (primarily breakfast), their coffee is hit or miss.  When it's a hit, it's the best coffee from any joint but when it's a miss it's just not good.  It's as if half the time you get the very last ounce from the coffee maker that's burnt from the hot plate.  Timmies on the other hand (At least up here in Barrie and Innisfil) have always been consistent."
567223,addy79,2011-03-29 13:56:00,573," agreeed, my timmies experiences north of the city are much better, seems like they take a little more pride in their work"
567311,aplumma,2011-03-29 19:52:00,6896,Mc donalds starts with the same water no matter were it is located. They filter the water using a R.O. unit that is dedicated to the drinks be it soda or coffee. They then have the coffee machines all the same with the same coffee blend for all of their restaurants.    Art
567321,Governator,2011-03-29 20:25:00,879,"  Which makes you wonder why their coffee is inconsistent.  I think the main reason McDonalds coffee is more inconsitent than Tim Hortons is because Tim Hortons replaces their coffee every 20 minutes after a brew to keep it fresh and never gives a burnt taste.  As far as I know McDonalds doesn't do this, a fresh cup from them is delicious but I don't want the last cup from the maker that's sitting on the hot plate for an hour during off times.  I'm certain that's where the bad cups come from."
567366,aplumma,2011-03-29 22:59:00,6896, Makes sense to me I personally don't drink coffee but do drink soda and I have found McDonalds that are on well systems have the same taste as ones on city water. I got curious and actually got a tour and a lesson on their water filtration systems. They have spent lots of time and money trying to improve on their consistency of their products from store to store. It seems the biggest flaw in the equation is as always the human factor.  Art
567389,Billy Bob,2011-03-29 23:48:00,5865, I had a GREAT and free coffee from McDee's today...they must be moving a lot of coffee fast because it's free here until April 10th...  Now about their food......they need a LOT of work there.....but one consistant thing I can say about their hamburgers is EVERYONE I ever get looks like they step on it before they put it in the bag...... ...and about a hour later you fill like crap...
567391,irishfield,2011-03-29 23:52:00,26272,It's a GREAT meal if you WERE constipated though Billy Bob !!

571203,Billy Bob,2011-04-11 21:24:00,5865, With these price spikes you should quit drinking coffee....  BTW our mediums cost that much....  But when I want a good cup of java I'd pay double that in the morning while motoring over to my fishing hole...

LOL Personally I just don't understand the love affair with Timmies. I will always try to avoid it like the plague. Wrong amounts, taxes and orders all the time. Terrible donuts also. I also don't understand how people can spend that kind of money everyday on Timmies. They must be making pretty good $$$$. The beast is driven by the consumer. However, the one thing that I know they do that is worthwhile, is send economically disadvantaged kids to amazing camp experiences every year."

566054,skeeter,2011-03-26 02:27:00,1907,"----- Original Message ----- Subject: FW: Overpricing at Tim Horton's    Interesting!   All you coffee lovers, here's a bit of news for you to check out and pass along to others  Does this happen at ALL locations?.....I wonder...                Let's see how many of us are actually being charged 23.5% tax without even noticing!   To whom it may concern:   I would like to bring attention to the fact that I'm constantly being overcharged at almost all Tim Horton's locations, no matter what I purchase on the menu.  It seems that either the tax rate is being set way too high or the cashiers are always pressing the wrong buttons on the cash register.  Take my purchase today in Stoney Creek for example: I purchased a breakfast wrap combo priced at $3.89.  I didn't do any substitutions at all, I simply ordered the combo with a medium sized coffee as pictured on the sign.  The cashier took my order and stated that my total came to $4.80. This didn't make much sense to me, so I did a quick calculation and noticed that I was charged 23.5% tax!  I brought this to the cashier's attention and she agreed that I was charged way too much and refunded me the different in change (since I had already paid with debit).  It's also important to note that at this point, the cashier explained to me that this seems to happen quite often, where the total price does not match the listed price of the item plus HST.   A second example of this happening to me:  I went to Tim Horton's in Oakville last week (head office to be specific) and bought a single cookie priced at $0.89.  My total came to $1.10. $0.21 tax for an $0.89 order.  This is again consistent with the 23.5% tax amount given in the example above.  This time I actually did pay the extra amount though, because I was in a hurry and left without thinking about what the total price should have been.   I know for certain that this has happened in the past as well, as I quite often visit Tim Horton's for lunch and many times the total seems to be quite a bit higher than it should, but I have always let it slide because I'm either in a hurry or don't want to argue with the cashier.  From now on though, I'm going to be more vigilant about checking my total and making sure that I'm not charged 23.5% tax.  I will also be forwarding this email on to many of my friends, as I'm sure they are also being burned by this without knowing.  I would highly recommend you have someone look into this as soon as possible, because as much as I love Tim Horton's, I'd have no problem taking my business elsewhere if I have to go through the annoying processing of re-calculating my total each and every time and arguing with every cashier out there."

566156,ehg,2011-03-26 15:44:00,2666,I am one of the few Timmies dislikers. Always used debit and didn't carry cash. After a long day of fishing i would want a coffee for the drive home. Pull into Timmies of highway and find out it is cash only no debit. With all the money they make selling frozen donuts and other crap items they were still too cheap to have debit. Apparently that is changing a bit now.
