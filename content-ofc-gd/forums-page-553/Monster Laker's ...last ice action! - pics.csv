Enjoyed another spectacular season on Simcoe this winter from Jumbo perch, consistent White fish limits but the lakers were the real treat! Most of my trips for consistent Laker/Whitie action was approx 20km out into the main lake with the Argo from Beaverton. But the last couple day of the season we really dialed the fish in... ton's of only lakers with thick schools of smelt moving through all day. We had a triple header and 3 double headers one day with Lakers which was fun for sure. Fish were all taken in 60 to 65 FOW on Flash spoons, darter heads with Gulp smelt minnows and tubes. Here is a sample of some of the fish we took (most released) on Mar 14th....We caught a number of fish in the 10 to 20lb class that day... Got 2 love Simcoe!           Take care and Good Fish'n... Greg."
