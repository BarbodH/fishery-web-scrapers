The lights only work when I close my swing tongue and contact is made at a certain point. At that point you can see a spark on the swing tongue joint and the lights come on. Open it an inch = off. Close it and put the swing tongue pin in = off. Finally we jammed a piece of copper between the main trailer/swing tongue surfaces and it got us to Dunnville and back.  Any ideas on what's going on????????  Thanks everyone. Landry"

570692,Bernie,2011-04-10 11:59:00,3190,For sure a bad ground. Drill a small hole on either side of the swing point and run a ground wire. Use grounding washers on each terminal and give it a protective coating to help prevent corrosion.

570929,kingofthesteelhead,2011-04-11 01:25:00,140,Either recut the ground or use some sandpaper to clean up the connection better and make sure there is no rust where it is grounded to.Had that problem last year.
570944,landry,2011-04-11 01:45:00,1005,Thanks guys!!!!!! I simply lengthened the ground wire so that it stretched past the swing tongue and fastened it to the main trailer body. I can see now that I had a problem starting last year as my lights are all now much brighter as well!!! I appreciate the help. Landry
