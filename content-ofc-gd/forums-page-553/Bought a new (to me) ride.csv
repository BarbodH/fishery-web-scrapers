570732,Terry,2011-04-10 14:23:00,14456,yeah it says diesel in the front window but you have to look real hard...   I think each vehicle will do us great...
570746,Tybo,2011-04-10 15:14:00,1373,Just need 4000 in rally snow tire and you won't get stuck either.
570851,corvette1,2011-04-10 22:14:00,1765,nice ride terry congrats
570914,Terry,2011-04-11 00:32:00,14456, yeah that's going to happen....LOL   I might..might look into something better in a snow tire  thanks all....I think I made a good buy
570923,Fisherman,2011-04-11 01:01:00,7201," By chance did you get the owner manual with it?  If so, do yourself a little favour and give it a quick once over, especially if it has a ""maintenance"" section for fluids, namely engine oil.  They are a slightly different creature and you don't want the local wrencher to dump something in there that shouldn't be.  As for the gas...No, no, no, you use fuel now.  Don't make that mistake.  In about 33 years of driving different diesels, I've never had a case of wet diesel in Canada, although I've heard south of the border is different.  Keep a spare fuel filter in the Jeep, at home it doesn't do ya any good."
570932,Terry,2011-04-11 01:29:00,14456,"yeah, I saw it takes a certain oil....thanks and now, I have been reading up on the fuel filter and one of the sensors and I will keep on top of them..it's going to take even more reading and a bit of playing to learn all this stuff......."
570959,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-11 02:09:00,2050," I'm the proudest Dad in the world but I'm a truck guy through and through brother!  I don't think I'd get to far down farmer Jack's mud trail across the road with a minivan, ( yes his name is Jack haha he's a cow farmer and my kids call him Granpa Jack) or be able to drive anywhere after a good snow storm considering I live 25 minutes from the nearest town and don't see a plow until well after everybody else.  I completely see the benefits of owning a minivan - my brother just bought a nice one, but we're a single vehicle family and I couldn't go without 4WD.  Just the way I am... And I only Paid 9 grand for it as well..... If I didn't live the country lifestyle, and was still back in the big smoke id probably be driving a Dodge Caravan... Reluctantly...  Anyways - awesome ride again Terry - enjoy it!"
570558,Terry,2011-04-09 21:51:00,14456,"well the dodge dakota isn't running well, and for a 6 it doesn't get very good mileage the darango is causing me problems and you would think there is a hole in the tank, cause it eats gas like crazy the v8 is hungry  so off I went looking for a replacement  I use a vehicle for work but it has to pull a boat too so a car wouldn't do  4 cylinder 4x4 vehicles didn't have the balls to pull my boat.....I was looking at the jeep partiot..look good price was right..about to buy it...yes I want air and cruise control, tow package, so I can tow my boat....(him)....you know the tow package doesn't include a trailer hitch.....  (me)..you mean I have to buy the ball I need for my trailer.... (Him)...we do not put any part of a hitch on the vehicle....just an oil cooler and electrical connector ...  (Me)...good bye  so I want good mileage and tow my boat...yeah  it looks like the ford f150 with the new motor..bit more then I wanted to pay right now and I really do not like to buy a new motor till it has been proven for a few years   ok used    well I found a 2006 jeep liberty I really liked  it gets great mileage and looks like it will pull the boat no problem...  so made a deal they get the darango, I get the liberty  it was a good drive to get it..cost me 1/2 a tank of gas to get there   got the liberty and it took under a 1/4 tank to get home......saved me 20+ bucks already.....  with the back seats down the huts may fit on top of each other, Wayne  A good compromise, till I buy a new one... <a href=""http://s27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/?action=view&current=ON20080409113818445_2010649549468696022-orig.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/ON20080409113818445_2010649549468696022-orig.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
570560,irishfield,2011-04-09 21:55:00,26272,"As long as our huts can snuggle in December, headin for that 3"" of ice over younder... good deal !!"
570565,misfish,2011-04-09 22:01:00,29133,Nice ride bud.  That would look sweet pulling a nice 2011 Ranger wouldnt it?
570574,Terry,2011-04-09 22:19:00,14456,sure would   you get the ranger and I will pull it anywhere you want...  well my next boat will most likely be a new lund...
570577,misfish,2011-04-09 22:24:00,29133,  And Im told I went to the dark side.
570578,Joey,2011-04-09 22:27:00,9122,"Nice looking ride Terry.  That looks much better than that one we saw on the side of the road in March  Now, off to look at Lund's are we"
570581,mercman,2011-04-09 22:40:00,7054,"Very nice Terry...Congrats. Looks brand new too.Those 4X4's will pull almost anything, and are really comfortable on the road."
570582,dave524,2011-04-09 22:44:00,4508,"OMG , it's a twin to the one I got 2 weeks ago, same year and colour  My story is pretty much the same, old 97 GMC Safari, needed new tires, brakes, exhaust and probably a few other things. Told the better half we could put 2 grand into it and still it would only be worth a couple of thou or so, time to go shopping.  Originally, I went to look at an 06 GMC Trailblazer, I have a 3500 lb cap landscape trailer and a 18 1/2 foot tinboat with a V4 on it that the 4.3 litre Safari towed well so thinking the 4.2l. Trailblazer would give adequate performance, alas when we got to the lot it was sold the day before. They had the Liberty for 3 grand less than what the Trailblazer was and only 52.000 klm's on it. Haven't towed with it yet, actually went this afternoon to the hitch shop but they closed at noon on Saturday ( darned small town   ) I live a couple of hundred yards from the boat launch and only use the trailer around the area,  no roads over 80 kph. so I'm pretty sure the 3.7l. will handle it, it's rated to tow 5000 lbs. , I don't expect to go over 3000lbs. Here's hoping we do well with them."
570585,Terry,2011-04-09 22:45:00,14456, yeah that ride home...I knew I had to get something else  did I say it's a diesel motor in it
570593,Joey,2011-04-09 23:06:00,9122, 
570600,Cudz,2011-04-09 23:38:00,2652,If it is a diesel than congrats.
570602,Terry,2011-04-09 23:48:00,14456,yes it is......
570603,Cudz,2011-04-09 23:55:00,2652,That 2.8 crd is good Mercedes engine. I have heard of a few trannies pooping out but that happens in any vehicle.  Good find.  They are pretty rare and they stopped making them after that year. How many kms?
570605,Fisherman,2011-04-09 23:59:00,7201,"Nice little Zoomer, keep the fuel filter clean, you'll be laughing as you pass the pumps."
570606,Terry,2011-04-10 00:01:00,14456,"70,000 km..barely broken in...  fuel filter..I will have to check on that , thanks"
570612,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-04-10 00:27:00,1107,Nice can't go wrong with a jeep
570621,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-10 00:56:00,2050,Nice ride Terry - I just bought an 04 durango with the hemi - she chugs gas for sure but it fits all three car seats side by side and still has room for grandma and grandpa in the third row... Pulls mu utility trailer full of scrap without batting an eye and doesn't even know it's towing my little boat.  Good deal!  Cheers
570629,Terry,2011-04-10 01:13:00,14456,"I loved the way my Darango pulled my boat, but she was getting old and was hard on gas...I get mileage paid to me at work, so I just doubled my profit on work related driving"
570635,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-10 01:26:00,2050,Understand %100 - I had no choice but to get a large SUV or a minivan.... I'm just not a minivan kind of guy.... We live out in the country to... I like to build things and haul stuff so SUV it was!  Plus thy don't really get around to plowing the roads around here and I'd rather be the guy pulling ppl out than to be the guy calling for help!
570641,BillM,2011-04-10 01:37:00,17367, Now you have a little bit of work ahead of you to make sure it stays running good.  Those CRD's are known for gunking up the MAP sensor which will kill your power and mileage.  You might want to vent the CCV to the atmosphere to stop that problem.  Also the EGR tends to get really dirty and will definitely need a cleaning.  Here's some required reading..  http://www.lostjeeps.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=54207  You'll also wanna stick to high volume stations to lower your chance of getting crappy fuel (Diesel contaminated with water)
570645,Terry,2011-04-10 01:38:00,14456,thanks for the info  I guess I got some learning to do
570647,BillM,2011-04-10 01:40:00,17367,"Nothing to complicated, just a bit of preventative maintenance!  After that you should be all set for quite a while!"
570669,Cudz,2011-04-10 03:40:00,2652,"Not only CRDs that have map sensor issues, both my Jeeps had the same prob.  The CRD might do it a bit quicker though."
570670,Cudz,2011-04-10 03:46:00,2652,"Hey I am not a minivan guy either but my minivan does all the things that your durango does but I don't look as cool doing it.  I also pull an 18ft boat with an i/o without issue.  I paid 8 grand for it 5 years ago and use all three rows of seats everyday (kids still fight though). I swore up and down I would never own a minivan but I must say they are practical.  I have owned many higher end cars in the past including BMWs and Infinities and my wife likes this thing better. lol. By the way my minivan will do around 1100 kms on the highway between fillups. Remember, it is not the car you drive, it is the arm that hangs out the window that matters. haha"
570703,dave524,2011-04-10 12:33:00,4508," OOPS   Maybe not as identical as it was at first glance. I've been logging less than 8,000 kms. a years, fuel economy was not a big issue with me. 2 or 3 days a week it doesn't leave the drive. I'm probably not a good candidate for a diesel vehicle, as it stands I probably should be putting stabilizer in if I fill the tank, it lasts that long"
