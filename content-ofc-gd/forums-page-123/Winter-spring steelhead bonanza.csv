I'll start it the winter and spring steelhead.  The winter fishing was fantastic, couldn't ask for nicer days on the bank. My Christmas Eve and Christmas Day morning consisted of drifting floats down the river than rushing home to beat the company to my door. The fishing was fast and furious and we were the only ones out there. Both mornings we banked 30-40 steelhead between our group of 3.  spring came and so did the steelhead. Locating fish was hard at times but once you found them they were egar to eat.  Now comes the 4th sat in April, the rivers are open and free to roam. We get the group together pack the camper and set out for a weekend on the bank. This usually consists of lots of laughs, beers, bonfires and crazy bbqs. This opener did not disappoint, between the group we landed over 100 fish and had many areas of the river to Ourselfs.                 "
