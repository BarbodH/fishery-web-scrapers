974197,GBW,2016-06-19 17:41:00,8460,Little late in the day but nice fish made it all good! Yeah we work odd hours.  Our goal was walleye but we found a few spots that looked good and well as you can tell worked out.  Went out again last night the same time 7 - 10pm and found 2 muskies surfacing and showing off their fin and tail but not willing to play...  I'm sure the one was this very fish posted above.
