It was a blast and an honour fishing with Mike and yourself and while the action wasn't fast and furious, we got into a few nice ones. Cheers bud!  There is no better way to bring the boat out of hibernation than chasing big channel cats in Dunnville. But before you can do that, you need bait... cutbait to be exact... and that's where my little man Tyler comes in. The sucka slaya, that's what they call him in the playground. He pulled one in that tipped the scales over 5 pounds - not bad for a 5 year old! A productive afternoon was also had fishing with Sebastian (moxie) and son... where a shopping cart was laden with sucktastic bounty and wheeled outta Oshawa creek in front of some wide-eyed onlookers... (Seb if you have the pic please add)         On to the kitties... no crazy numbers days (think best was 20), but steady action and lots of quality fish in the 15+ pound range. I managed a 20.5 as the best out of my boat this season. Here's the pics.  Sheldon & Mike on FFT trip              My bro Paul and Dave Roach        Demon Dave on the prowl hahahaha          Best pic of the season, amazing colours      GIANT    20.5 pounder    "
