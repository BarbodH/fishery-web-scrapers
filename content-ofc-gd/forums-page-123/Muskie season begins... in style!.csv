973416,Joey,2016-06-13 02:20:00,9122,"Nice Pete, off to a great start as usual"
973430,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-13 03:29:00,8243,For many like me Pete that's a fish of a lifetime. I am so happy you Musky guys are able to get out there finally. Fanatic isn't the word to describe some of you Essox folk.
973703,MJL,2016-06-15 00:47:00,2427,Beauty fish Pete  Looking to land my first ever muskie this season
973746,aplumma,2016-06-15 12:17:00,6896,nice fish Pete I am heading up to Nipissing for muskie opener this week. I hope I find some as nice as those.  Art
974147,cl_fishin,2016-06-18 19:39:00,138,Nice Fish Pete!
972704,Fisherpete,2016-06-07 21:05:00,1814,"After a very very very long wait, it was finally slime time... opening weekend... and there on the Saturday, I sat in class. Whaaaat? Yes class for my apprenticeship program. Sigh. For the long-term good I suppose.  After a few setbacks on Sunday morning, the boys already out and into a bunch of fish, I decided to head out solo for the afternoon. Didn't see a single fish until some nasty weather approached... and as the old saying goes, muskies will eat before a storm! This fish inhaled an entire magnum bulldawg - do you think she was hungry? Getting good solo pics is not the easiest but these turned out pretty darn good. 47"" is actually my best opening day fish ever. Gallie - thanks for the tip - this might have just been the fish you guys saw!  Cheers Pete    "
972710,AKRISONER,2016-06-07 21:18:00,5558,"damn pete, thats a clean one, way shinier than the old rotten hog i nabbed with ya in the fall.  I swear to god pete, you put more muskies in the boat than some people put eyes."

972738,Gallie,2016-06-07 22:40:00,1215,No worries pete! If we couldnt have her im glad you were the one to land her! And i thought i would get laughed at for throwing big rubber around on opener but thats all they would touch.
972747,Dan668,2016-06-07 23:19:00,1120,"Nice fish! I kept on bringing in pike after pike on my 9"" shadzilla.  I didn't see anyone else out throwing big rubber."
