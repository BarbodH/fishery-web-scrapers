959867,davew3,2016-02-26 20:42:00,430,My wife and I are booked into a camp on this system in June.  I have never spent any time in this area.  Would anyone offer up some tips and tricks for this area? Would be appreciated.  Regards
960314,davew3,2016-02-29 14:48:00,430,"Wow,  no one has ever been there before.  "
960315,jimmer,2016-02-29 14:59:00,2730,I haven't  been there before. Somewhere I would like to try though.
960324,SmokestackLightnin,2016-02-29 16:14:00,390,I own a cottage on the system.  Where are you staying?  And when in June?
960346,davew3,2016-02-29 19:12:00,430,"Smokestacklightnin,   I will be staying at Cushnies Outpost.   I do not know where on the system they are yet.   We are going up the last week of June.  I hope the blackflies will be done by then.  I guess my main concern would be hitting any reefs or rocks.  I did that before over on the French.  Regards"
960378,Kerry,2016-02-29 21:22:00,383,My buddy used to have a cottage on Dollars lake -other side of ESS Narrows. We used to fish up past Whip O Will Lodge for walleye.Lots  of Pike and smallies in the system too.Classic canadian shield lake lots of rock and timber.All species love both but it's still a river and they do move around. Kerry
960471,davew3,2016-03-01 14:52:00,430,Thanks Kerry.  I hope the rocks you mentioned are marked so I don't find one the hard way.
960485,Freshtrax,2016-03-01 16:40:00,2215,"Water was the lowest I have ever seen It in October ,  hopefully it comes up!   I was west of the highway."
960567,AKRISONER,2016-03-01 21:33:00,5558,my only tip is to drive slow homie!  you can lose a leg in a minute on those lakes.
960866,davew3,2016-03-03 13:58:00,430,"Over the years I have used more then a few props   I always carry a spare, nuts, and pins.  Especially when out in the boonies."
960870,SmokestackLightnin,2016-03-03 14:27:00,390,"I am not familiar with Cushnie's, I think it may be in Dollars Lake.  Navigating the system is not too treacherous, most of the shoals are well marked.  The only tricky shoal in Dollars that I have come across is the one out from Whip-Poor-Will Lodge (now called Dollars Island Resort).  It's marked but does extend past some of the markings just go wide.  If you head down the river to Kawigamog just stay in the middle, same with navigating the entire system.  There lots to see and when travelling on the river between the lakes stay in the middle, sorry if I am stating the obvious.  The fish will be heading to their summer patterns at the end of June so look for weed beds close to deep water, there are lots of them.  One thing about the system is the amount of bait, there are minnow schools everywhere so if the weed bed you are fishing does not have minnows then find another one.  If you find one or two with fish on it during the day, come back at dusk.  Enjoy your stay, there is lots of water to explore."
960877,davew3,2016-03-03 15:42:00,430,Thank you.  I am looking forward to this.  Already thinking of things to pack.  Have to talk to my wife's uncle to see what we should bring.  Come on spring !!!
960883,Sterling,2016-03-03 16:01:00,477,"Kwigamog is partially charted and shows some steep areas on the east end of the lake; https://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=en#@13&key=a|dwGtafgN  No marked rocks or shallows though, it's going to be a slow-going affair for you!"
960886,davew3,2016-03-03 16:17:00,430,great  I do have GPS with Nav so it should help .  Thanks for the info.  Regards
973628,davew3,2016-06-14 18:12:00,430,Well the time is getting closer.  Looks like I will be staying on Smiths Bay.  The north end of the system north of of hwy 522. From what I here I will be searching for large northerns and pickerel for dinner.  Any special spots or sights I should take in while I am there?  Regards
