973368,lickmyarmpit,2016-06-12 23:14:00,359,I recently moved to the timmins area at the beginning of may.  I've been really busy with the move and such but had a little time for some fishing lately and man I can't wait to do some exploring. There's hundreds of lakes around and im just starting to learn the area. I know the hold on this fish isn't good but the pic was taken after a failed 20 minute revival.  The pic taken in the water boat side made it look allot smaller than it was.

That's one of many monsters that lurk them there waters. I want to get back up that way before I hit my best before date. According to the Google thing it's only 10 hrs. Google must not ever drive during daylight to get past Barrie."
