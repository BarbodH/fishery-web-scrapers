And what a beautiful morning to be on the lake, it got cold overnight and I was surprised to find frost on my windshield, but the cold made an amazing morning mist on a mirror calm lakeâ€¦stunning!  Nothing fancy as usual, just jigs and minnows in around 16' to 21' FOW. Use of electronics is key on this lake as the fish can be scattered at this time of year, basically I troll around till I mark one or two and drop the bait on their head so to speak. I have been fishing this lake a long time now so it does not take long to find one or two marks. Good fun on a calm morning.    "

973035,Moosebunk,2016-06-09 23:54:00,3970,Around late May early June every year I still get the itch to jig walleye Simon.  You do know how lucky you are don't you?  Great morning action.

973107,mikeh,2016-06-10 13:05:00,824,"Another great video, did you get a new boat? so used to seeing the older one"
973112,Dara,2016-06-10 13:18:00,3052,Nice size fish...I love jigging them up. We always try to cast the jig way out then jig in...you get to reel the fish in for a longer time
973133,AKRISONER,2016-06-10 14:16:00,5558, hahaha epic   you must get sick of eating walleye...if thats at all possible?
973136,Tomcat,2016-06-10 14:23:00,395,Great looking morning topped off with some nice walleye. Thanks for sharing Simon.
973294,Dabluz,2016-06-12 15:23:00,701,Good stuff.  Makes me want to buy a camera to put on my head and show the nice walleye and brook trout I catch in my region.
973339,Joeytier,2016-06-12 20:33:00,3990,That feeling when you first sting a big walleye and can't even get it to budge off the bottom  Great vid again Simon.
973345,Sinker,2016-06-12 21:11:00,8692,Awesome! New boat? Looks good bud!
