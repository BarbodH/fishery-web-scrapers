Decided to do the carpet getting a little punky at 25 years old. Learned lots like not doing g it again lol. Progress so far. 
972536,porkpie,2016-06-05 23:38:00,2521,Looks good!  I have to redo the front deck on my boat.  One side is starting to rot a little bit.  I'm not looking forward to it.  I think I'm going to do vinyl.

972850,grimsbylander,2016-06-08 19:03:00,3016,"Nope just carpet don't wanna get to spoiled  Wanna be able to close my eyes and think I'm in a 521C. lol  I want to do my carpet be realistically, it's still early. I can go another couple years for sure before I replace. I'm just too picky about my boat. Plus, it's my seats I really need to do. I hoping to find some Ranger buckets online and do the switch. If not, it'll be a reupholstering job."
972933,aplumma,2016-06-09 12:09:00,6896,Very nice job Ernie.....  I rehabed a 1989 Ranger because of the way it rode. I ran the new ones and they don't behave the same. I keep the original motor and found it had already been converted to a GTX 150 which in it's day was a hot lick of a motor. All of the plumbing was redone on the live wells as well as electrical upgrades. I ended up with vinyl on the center part to land fish and keep carpet on the casting decks. The big improvement was converting it to hydraulic steering man what a difference.  Art
973874,ecmilley,2016-06-16 02:11:00,2163,Pretty much have it done just waiting.for windshields. And come. Handles.
