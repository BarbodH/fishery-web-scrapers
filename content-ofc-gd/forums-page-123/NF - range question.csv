They also have skeet, hand gun, long gun and archery ranges. Great bunch of guys and the pig roasts are off the hook!!!!!"

972803,dave524,2016-06-08 11:02:00,4508,"What discipline/s are you into ? Not all ranges have everything, I liked centre fire rifles, had 200 yds at the range I belonged to, would have enjoyed more.  Some are shotgun only, trap ,skeet or sporting clays."

I still am a member of TCRC in Waterloo region, they have 300yds rifle so, the longer the better  I also shoot trap and archery but those are more common."

973711,dave524,2016-06-15 01:19:00,4508,"Sheridan gun club. Not too far south of you  Maybe you mean Sharon Gun Club, that is a real swank place I believe you have buy a share to be a member there and they rarely come available and when they do you'd have to take out a second mortgage on the house to pay for it. The upside is you get to rub elbows with whose who in the GTA,  Edit: actually not as bad as I thought, but this is what some one is offering not what the asking price is  http://www.kijiji.ca/b-gta-greater-toronto-area/sharon-gun-club-share/k0l1700272"
973712,Steve,2016-06-15 01:22:00,2075,I've been to Sharon GC for a client event.  Definitely a swanky place.
