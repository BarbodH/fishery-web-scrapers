972439,pics,2016-06-04 23:33:00,1268,It's a shame that the system is so corrupt for tickets.. I really wish there was an alternative way to buy them other than the monopoly we have now.. tickets were unavailable at 10:01 but I could get a pair of the worst seats for $400 US from ticketmasters sister company Stubhub..

972654,AKRISONER,2016-06-07 13:45:00,5558,a classmate of mine in highschool is a radio host in St Catherines now.  Hes gaining a bit of fame from this http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/06/04/tragically-hip-tickets-scalper_n_10299728.html
972662,leaf4,2016-06-07 16:17:00,2466,Lmao I heard that the other day... so wrong yet so right haha
972735,FrankTheRabbit,2016-06-07 22:23:00,479,"Heard the recording this afternoon and I think the radio host is a dink. Just because you can't afford it, doesn't give you the right and cry like a little baby because it's out of your reach to afford. If you can't afford it, too bad. Live within your means. This concert isn't life or death, but the radio host decides to act out his inner childishness to prove a weak point. It's supply and demand.  If you want a contractor to work on your house, but can't afford his ""jacked up"" prices, do you call him up to drive an hour only to tell him to ""shove it"" with his high prices?  That should result in some sort of beat down. What a whiny turd.  Wish I was a radio station boss and so I could tell him to come to Toronto for a radio gig that will pay him $1mil per year, only to tell him ""SIKE!!!"" and have him drive back to his crappy job in St Cats."
972755,leaf4,2016-06-08 00:05:00,2466,"While the analogy is close, you can always hire another contractor, you can't hire another Gord Downie. It's the piggybacking off of a guy with a terminal illness that everyone is pissed off about, if this was just a regular tour it would not have been near the frenzy it was."
972771,FrankTheRabbit,2016-06-08 01:47:00,479,"Ticket scalpers have always existed and only now it's being brought to our full attention because some feel the injustice of someone making a little money off of a terminally ill person. Not to offend anyone in the trade, but funeral homes have forever made money off dead people when families are in full mourning—they can easily charge $10,000 for a service.  Thus far, much of the frustration and anger have been voiced by the fans regarding the inability to acquire tickets and the price increase seen on re-sale sites...not so much about scalpers taking advantage of Downie's health.  I think what is the problem is how major resellers acquire the tickets. From what I've read, they use ticket-bots and that usually leaves the average concert goer at a huge disadvantage. Most of the time, we have no idea how many tickets are actually available for sale...they reserve some tickets to friends & family, VIP, sponsors, etc., and in the end, how many tickets are left?  I don't think the promoters really care since they were able to sell out the show...they've made their money, covered their expenses, and onward with the show.  I just think that fans are directing their anger and frustration at the wrong party, while major ticket resellers, like StubHub, are laughing their way to the bank."

974015,AKRISONER,2016-06-17 13:45:00,5558,the CBC would literally have to be the dumbest collective of media managers in the entire world to not take up the opportunity to broadcast that concert...seriously? I cant believe this is even a consideration.  The viewership is going to be literally insane...But what about the intense Murdoch Mysteries ratings?!!!
974019,kickingfrog,2016-06-17 14:46:00,8333,"Scalpers are going to charge you fifty bucks to watch it in your own living room.   This isn't like picking a happy meal. The group would have to sign-off, the tour promoter and maybe a half dozen other entities that would all want their piece. Maybe another network wanted to do it? To be safe they'd also want to wait until most/all the tickets were sold."

BTW people who have been injected with the polio virus DO NOT contact the virus, as its part of our inoculation, and i believe that it why it so aggresivly attracts the tumour, i believe it was a German Scientist who came up with the discovery, and the lead doctor at the hospital where it is been used is totally astonished at the positive outcomes so far."

972386,GbayGiant,2016-06-04 19:07:00,1780,"TOUR CANCELLED!  KINGSTON, ON - The Tragically Hip has announced that it will be cancelling its final national tour as the members of the band were unable to acquire tickets to any of the 15 events they were set to perform at. The group made the announcement after it became clear that TicketMaster had already sold the band’s backstage passes to scalpers and was unable to purchase them back at a reasonable price. “$3,500 just to see myself perform!”said Gord Downie, looking at the prices on StubHub. “And that’s in US dollars?!” The iconic Canadian group claimed that they made several efforts to obtain stage level tickets. Guitarist Paul Langlois, drummer Johnny Fay and bassist Gord Sinclair all made desperate appeals on their Facebook accounts, but the few friends that had tickets refused to barter away their prized admissions into what would have been one of the greatest live music shows in Canadian history. The band explained that guitarist Rob Baker nearly obtained two 300 level tickets at the MTS Centre in Winnipeg but was timed out as he fumbled with his credit card to complete the transaction. “That was our only chance guys; I’m so sorry,” said a remorseful Baker to his fellow band members with his head down low.
