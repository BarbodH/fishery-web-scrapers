971891,bow slayer,2016-05-31 13:50:00,1074,picked up an old rapala lure over the weekend for a few bucks. Just wondering when did rapala make there jointed lures with a metal lip?
971892,Headhunter,2016-05-31 13:58:00,5703,"I don't remember them ever using a metal lip on their jointed lures, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I recall larger stick type baits, mostly oriented toward salt water fishing having metal lips, but not the jointed ones. You may have a decent find there... HH"
971897,BillM,2016-05-31 14:12:00,17367,The salt water jointed Rapalas had a metal lip.  We used those out on Lake O for salmon when I was younger.

HH  I have a Rapala Sliver, deep diving jointed minnow that I bought to imitate a smelt for trout fishing.  It has a metal lip on it. "
