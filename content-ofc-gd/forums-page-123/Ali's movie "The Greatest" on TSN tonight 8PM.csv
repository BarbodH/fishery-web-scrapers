He plays himself in the Cassius Clay era and on and Ernest Borgnine plays Angelo Dundee. It hit the theatres in 1977 if you are an Ali fan just seeing him for a few hours is worth the pain of watching it, it wasn't that bad, yea it was. I don't think I have seen it since we went to the theatre to see it on the big screen.  OOPS 8:30 PM not 8:00"
