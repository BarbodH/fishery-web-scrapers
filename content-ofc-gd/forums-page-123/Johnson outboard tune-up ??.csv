972978,davew3,2016-06-09 17:41:00,430,GTA is a big place         n/s/e/w ?         Halton Marine Burlington is where I take mine.
972987,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-09 18:43:00,8243,I recommend Dundas Marine or Bay City both in Hamilton.  Tuning up a small motor isn't rocket science. With some mechanical ability and You Tube anyone can do it.
973039,Garnet,2016-06-10 00:18:00,2056,"I recommend seafoam and spark plugs. It not likely has had seafoam before so start with 1/4 mixture and move up as season progresses.  If it runs rough or won't troll on, the front is a air mixture adjuster. Start your motor and troll until warm, turn knob 1/4 turn continue to troll until you notice motor change tune. Keep going the same direction until it runs like crap. Start back at first spot and go other direction until it runs like crap. Adjust to middle. If it's trolling you do fine tune from there.  Too check plugs is an other science.  Always always run good oil in 2 strokes."
