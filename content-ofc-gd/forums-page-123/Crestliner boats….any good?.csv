973597,G.mech,2016-06-14 14:56:00,830," I cannot comment on the 4 stroke Mercs, but the smaller 2 strokes are not good fishing engines.  They don't troll smoothly, seeming to spit and sputter and rattle.  The old OMCs were awesome for trolling, but then if you don't troll and are more of a run n gun angler, that is a moot point.  I troll the 115 all day long without a single sputter or miss.  In all honesty, it's quieter and smoother than my 6HP 4 stroke kicker..."

There's an old '76 or so 9.8 in the boat house that still runs fine, and both Mercs on the back of my Lund have been ZERO issues. Nothing but oil changes the past 9 seasons. No matter the brand, there's always at least one dud... anyone see the car lift off the ground when Kyle blew his 50K engine on Sunday !  Merc or Yamaha, I'd run either. No issues with our 25 HP Honda either.  As for trolling.. Downrigging speed it's the 9.9, Musky I troll the 275 for 10 hours at 3.5 to 5.5 MPH and then just power up and go home!"

972472,captpierre,2016-06-05 13:59:00,2521,Had a CO check us on Nippising 9 yrs ago. Had a Crestliner with 2 str Yammy. I asked him how the boat held up. I had just bought my Lund and before that had considered a Crestliner. He said it had performed well and it took a pounding on Nippising's big water. Says a lot.
972474,jjcanoe,2016-06-05 14:15:00,744,"So, I bought a brand new Crestliner Vision 1700 Wt last July, this was after nearly a year of looking at pretty much all makes and models (both new and used) in and around the size I was looking for. Only 2 things I'm not fond of with my boat. 7""+ fish finder, needs a ram mount, although this seems to be an issue on just about every make and model of boat. Livewell size on my vision is only 13 gallons.(seems bigger but that's what it's listed at) This seems very small for some reason. I don't keep a lot of fish, however if I was in a tournament this might be an issue. Other than those 2 minor annoyances, I'm really happy with my Vision. Huge, forward storage, battery compartment holds 2 group 27's, decent rear storage, consoles are laid out nice, fit and finish are top notch. My two favorite things about this boat are the jumps seats at the back, this gives you a huge rear casting deck without losing cabin floor space (like the foldout seats) as well as not having to shift gear around to fold those seats out. If you ever plan to upgrade things, run wire, add electronics, stereo/speakers, on board chargers etc, (I've done all of the above) they (Crestliner ) made it really easy. Wiring conduits are very accessible as is the fuse block. Need bow electronics? No problem wiring was already there. Speakers? wire already there. Knock outs for the speakers, already there. Added a pedestal base on the rear deck, cutout was already there! The j-hook system for the cover is really slick as well! I had a Lund before this. My new boat can take a good pounding on Lake Erie, Huron or Ontario, as well as smaller cottage country lakes (so far so good)"
972475,jjcanoe,2016-06-05 14:19:00,744,"Also came with a 115 Mercury four stroke, which from online industry and user reviews is pretty much bulletproof, however I've only owned Mercury, so I may be a bit biased"

Yes, Mercury owns Lund, Crestliner, Princecraft, Lowe, and some fibreglass brands.  Yamaha owns G3 boats.  There still are some independant brands such as Alumacraft, Legend, and Starcraft/Smokercraft/Sylvan (all one company).  But Legend still pair their boats with Mercuray.  If you go with Alumacraft or Starcraft/Smokercraft/Sylvan then you may get to choose the motor for the combo providing that the dealer carries more than one brand of motor."

He should chime in on this thread. I know he recently had the transom replaced as they don't seal the top of the transom at the factory. Easy fix if caught soon enough. Remove the metal cap on the transom and put in a rubber seal along the top. Re-attach the metal cap and it should be good for some time HH"
