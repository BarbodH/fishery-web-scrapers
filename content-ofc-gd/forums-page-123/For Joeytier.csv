973751,Joeytier,2016-06-15 13:17:00,3990,What a pleasant little lake.  We drove Chad's Mazda B400 down the hydrolines and carried canoe and gear in off the lines.  You nearly landed on my secret boulder

You nearly landed on my secret boulder  I know it's probably not , but the bows and the description on the trip in sound identical to Beanpole Lake, off the hydrolines that run north of Haliburton Lake. Good memories of that one."
973773,Rod Caster,2016-06-15 16:08:00,5784,"Nice landing, and yes, you nearly landed on Joey's hotspot where that massive 10lbs+ rainbow was caught...wish I could find the pic"
973782,irishfield,2016-06-15 16:58:00,26272,"Wasn't sure if you'd found your way in. Take off wasn't as fun, full power failure just as I lifted off the step. Spent 2 hours on that little island tearing a carb apart with a leatherman tool and putting it all back together!"

Good memories of that one. Don't think it was Beanpole. I think access has been cut off and it's no longer stocked. That's where I caught 1 of my first rainbows---about 5 lb and stuffed with crays."

That's where I caught 1 of my first rainbows---about 5 lb and stuffed with crays.  Ever go to the lake south of it ? Dad and I would paddle along the south shore of Beanpole to a marked portage and haul the canoe a short distance to another lake, it had Specs in it"
