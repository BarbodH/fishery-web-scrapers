973465,SirCranksalot,2016-06-13 14:02:00,3291,On Lake O with a tin boat yesterday?????
973466,Fisherman,2016-06-13 14:06:00,7201,4 M boat in those conditions.
973524,FloatnFly,2016-06-13 22:53:00,1640,"4 M boat in those conditions.  mt thoughts exactly, stubborn old guys, one their 50's other in their 70's should have known much better than to go out in 3-4 ft waves in a 12ft boat."
973578,Fishwilly,2016-06-14 11:48:00,206,If winds are over 20 km/h I'll stay off lake O.  That's in a 18'  deep V . A 14' tinner in those conditions is plain crazy. Sad they had to pay the ultimate price for it though.
