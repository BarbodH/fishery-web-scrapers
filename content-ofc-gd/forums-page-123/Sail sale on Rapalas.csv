973879,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-16 03:42:00,937,How's the selection?  Was it part of the 80yr anniversary promo?
973888,captpierre,2016-06-16 11:35:00,2521,Cool. I see CT has PowerPro on for 20% off
973933,Dave Bailey,2016-06-16 17:24:00,1641,How's the selection?  Was it part of the 80yr anniversary promo?  I noticed more than a half dozen different types in the bin. And they all have the 80th anniversary stickers on them.
973937,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-16 17:50:00,937,I was at the Etobicoke location about a month ago and they only had these.  I wish I was there when they had more stock.    
973992,GBW,2016-06-17 02:48:00,8460,"Have to wonder if someone found a ""golden"" one and didn't even look at it for that but just wanted the lure for the price and picked some up to replace lost lures and or got it as a gift for someone.  If I was given one as a gift I sure wouldn't be thinking ""does it have gold font?"" for the Rapala paint job on the body...  Still a good deal for those that use those lures for sure.  So much for me selling all mine @ $5 each..."
