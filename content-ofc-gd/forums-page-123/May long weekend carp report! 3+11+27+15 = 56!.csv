972736,Fisherpete,2016-06-07 22:29:00,1814,"The May long weekend means two things... opening up the family cottage, and catching piles of carp! The water was a bit cool on the Friday, but heated up steadily over the weekend with the hot weather and so did the fishing. The carp count - Friday 3, Saturday 11, Sunday 27 and Monday 15 in half day. I'm sure the steady chumming I did contributed to the increasing numbers too... Biggest was around 22 pounds, and the first two were back-to-back mirrors! I'm not sure who has more fun... the kids catching giants or me helping them to do so! (ok, it's me   )    16.25lb mirror   make that back-to-back mirrors!     double trouble!   big one for my brother Will's 9 year old son Callum (don't you dare trying help him bring them in on his turn!)   Where's his teeth daddy?   My brother Paul's dog Winston will stand in the water in this pose until you throw something... anything... for him to chase! All day long   Will with one           Sophia's turn!   Gotta kiss'em!             Hey! I took a turn lol   Teaching catch and release...   She gone!   22 singin my Baby's on the Level... (c'mon... the White Stripes...)       Andrew, Mike C and his bro Pete came up the following weekend and got into a few on their centerpins - now THAT is a battle!"
972737,Gallie,2016-06-07 22:37:00,1215,Thats a lot of carp! Looks like a blast!
972749,leaf4,2016-06-07 23:21:00,2466,"Jeebus that's alot of carp, those mirror carp sure are cool looking"
972828,shimano19,2016-06-08 15:31:00,196,Me and my brother were planning on carp fishing on the Saturday then I recieved a message from Fisherpete saying he was doing the same so we decided to meet up. Me and my brother fish them on 13' float rods and a centerpin so it was a whole different battle for Andrew and Pete. My home made boillies and the monster carp ones seemed to be getting them to eat. We got a good number of fish and it made a fun day. Thanks again pete for the invite and awesome breakfast haha.         
973273,Fisherpete,2016-06-12 02:21:00,1814,We gotta do that again soon Mike - my brother is up there this weekend and said there are tons around.
