There's some well known spots, Pickerel Point, where Edgar Creek dumps in, there's a rock pile marked with a buoy and the deep hole just south of the lodge. We did well for pike in the bays in the north end.  The lake is very shallow and takes some getting used to."
973676,MCTFisher9120,2016-06-14 23:57:00,3761,"1/4-3/8oz Jig's Colour doesn't matter much, bring a assortment of grubs in the 3-4"" size. Early season opening 2-3 weeks smaller seems to work better the larger grubs in June/July. White Grub on a Chartreuse head was my favourite but every guide has there special. For Pike White and Black buzz baits seem to work well, we would put a grub on those too to give them some lift to keep them on the surface, a small swimbait would do also rigged on a large hook with little to no weight. Johnson Silver minnow in the 1/2-1oz size works well for Pike and you will catch walleye on those also. We would use single or twin tail grub's as a trailer on those spoons. Remember single barbless so spinnerbaits, buzz baits, wire leaders and braided line are just a few of the things you will need. You will catch fish and lot's hope this helps!"
973871,scuro2,2016-06-16 01:54:00,904,"It all depends when you go...the lake is so shallow that the SW end becomes too warm say mid-July. As soon as there is a heatwave the SW shuts down. You would have to boat up around fossil island then to get into ""deeper"" water. The weather is so unpredictable that you really won't know if it like early spring or summer till you get there. A temp gauge is key as is a GPS...it's a big lake."
