Then drop what ever at the app store and on your way home, don't forget to pay the $400 fine as well. That's a $1000+phone call/text that you just made/received! I also have to wonder what an employer would say, should the phone being confiscated be a company phone. As far as a warrant is concerned, is that call/text really worth the court time and legal fees incurred to fight it? Driving is a privilege. Folks have to remember that! HH"

You will likely see where I am coming from(might not agree with it)  I mentioned police state, along with that comes draconian laws, and thats why Ive mentioned alot of different factors.  This is one area where manufactures could make a SUBSTANTIAL difference without violating personal and privacy laws(to a degree, for the greater good)  Lets face it, it is not our right to take a human life. So if we can eliminate that in one particular area, why not?  But this is an isolated case. I believe this to be very beneficial.  But it shouldnt or cannot translate into legislation with other areas that have differencials involved ie huntin, fishing, etc  Imo, this is one area government could legislate a positive bill that harms nobody, but saves alot of bodies.  At no cost be it. Its simple. Any tech manufacturer could do this at little to no cost."

The cars sold in Canada are different than the ones sold in the US. These differences are mandated by the govt.  There are plenty of other examples of products that have different requirements in order to be sold in Canada. Electrical devices and parts for example need to be CSA certified or they can't be sold in Canada."

973085,GBW,2016-06-10 04:47:00,8460," I've called 911 when following a drunk on more than one occasion. Same here and ironically the 911 operator asked if they could call me back if needed and I said ""sure but I'm still driving and on my hands free so your call I guess"".  I knew the person was not 100% sober as I walked out of the bank they walked out of the beer store right beside and swearing and so forth under their breath about not able to get more beer.  I watched him open a beer from a cooler in the back seat and pour it into a ""portable coffee cup"" have a sip and drive off.  If the beer store will not serve you and then you open a beer and drive off, one would assume I made the right call there...  Back to the idea.  The OS for the phone company is a valid idea but then they would have to sell ""Ontario"" ready phones.  This means the GPS is on 24/7 and this will reduce battery life thus not a happy user.  The set ""speed"" would have to be around 25 to 30 MPH and have different settings.  Example:  Your phone will not work in a moving 'car' unless you pick the proper setting and will only have access to hands free in the car.  Setting 2: boat travel, able to talk and or text.  Setting 3: Passenger in 'car' talk and text can work.  BUT WE ALL KNOW that MOST of the people will use setting 3 all day every day.  Sad but true...  If I'm driving places other than to work and back (only around 3KM) my hands free is ON so I can take calls only.  I set up different sounds for different things (email vs text vs BBM msg from my kids).  So if I hear it's a BBM from my kids then I pull over and check it out.  All others now wait OR I have the passenger reply for me."

973095,DanD,2016-06-10 11:36:00,2223,"Very interesting thread. Before cell phones if we wanted to call someone, we had to stop at a phone booth. Following the law, if we want to call or text, we're suppose to stop to do so. My solution would be that all vehicles have a blocking device; that if the vehicle is in drive, there is no cell communications. Any in coming text or call, the blocking device would put out some form of chime alerting you; pull over and see what it about. With the electronics in today's vehicles; it wouldn't be very hard to do and at a minimal cost. Older vehicles would be grandfathered, until they were sold and as part of the safety inspection the blocking device would need to be installed to pass the inspection. If the device was found to be tampered with; the police would pull the plates off the vehicle; as they can do now with an unsafe vehicle. It would also be very easy for the police to check. On a routine stop ask the occupants for a cell number; if the call goes through, you just lost the plates and you're going home in a tow truck and the vehicle to a garage to be safety checked.

Legislate the phone manufacturers to incorporate into their OS' a system that looks at the phones GPS and when the GPS hits 5 MPH the phone is disabled for everything except 911 calls. Very simple to do at the operating system level. Some merit to this, but, that will only increase the value of the millions of smart phones out there as it will be impossible to retrofit every phone in everyones hand...there will very quickly become a black market for older and cracked phones. Of course Apple a fiercely protective US company and Samsung of Korea will not cater to the Canadian market or agree to limit the freedom of their customer.  There is not a simple answer to the problem. Again, it's not a perfect solution but heavy fines and demerits would cause SOME of the idiots to think twice or start walking....."

Those of us here in the GTA are dealing with millions of drivers on the road, every day. That's a whole lot different than what folks living in small towns or rural areas experience. Ernie says go ahead and catch me and likely, he's not ever going to be ""caught"" and is likely not the problem driver we are talking about. We have traffic like L.A. here in Toronto. It would be the exception to travel any length of time in the city and NOT see some tool on the phone. Too many times I have had to avoid a situation at highway speeds caused by a distracted driver.

First guy simply drove right off our paved and busy country road about a 1/2km from the end of my driveway.  The other fella, on a winding road near Buck Lake outside of Westport, was over on the wrong side of the road while texting and hit another guys trailer, nearly killing himself.  It absolutely drives me nuts following obvious texters on the highways. I'd say teen girls are the worst but it could easily be adult men and women and too.  I've laid on the horn with a couple of them lately. And when I lay on the horn, I follow the car close awhile and don't let up.  Agree with high fines...

What happens when you get a $5000 fine for texting and driving?  Its a ripple effect. People lose jobs, licenses, jail time, possibly family loss etc.  Where does this money go from the fines? What happens to the impounded cars? Where does the increase in police come from? Are they sped through training or properly trained? How does a police officer know, beyond a reasonable doubt, you were texting or using a mobile device?  The questions never end.  And heavy fines/jail time solve nothing.  Who pays for these individuals to be incarcerated? US.  Fines/jailtime just create way more legal issues, deaths, injury, loss of work, court time, more police, more taxes, etc  Again. Software/hardware eliminates the problem altogether. Why not explore that option?"

Well, with that thought in mind, why not equate the penalties in a similar way? To that end, I humbly suggest that those caught texting/calling/surfing while behind the wheel, be subject to not only the now roughly $400 fine, but also confiscation of their phone for a period of time. We take the car away from a drunk driver, why can't we take the phone away from a distracted driver? First offense, phone confiscated for 10 days Second offense 30 days Third offense  90 days  Probably won't ever completely solve the problem, but I bet many would think twice before they reach for the phone while driving. Your collective thoughts? HH"
972966,BITEME,2016-06-09 16:58:00,1968,For get taking the phone good idea and all just impound the car. Really you know you shouldn't be doing it  It pisses me off I ride most of the summer and it's amazing how many people do it and make random lane changes or lane drifts my neck is getting sore  Peter
972971,Headhunter,2016-06-09 17:17:00,5703,"I think you may be right Peter, the car is licensed, the driver is licensed, but the phone is not. Impounding the car, is probably the easiest legal route to go. Impounding the phone as evidence until trial could be another tact.  With the traffic on the highways here in the GTA, you have to keep your wits about you. I don't need a distracted driver to take me or my family out, cause they got a text. HH"

972981,Headhunter,2016-06-09 18:26:00,5703,All good except for when a passenger is using their phone in a car! HH
972983,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-09 18:34:00,8243,"I might need my phone for an emergency at high speeds. Like to call 911 when I see someone texting or talking while driving. Rick you will need the phone to talk to the Paramedics when you are driving to the Hospital doing 140KPH when you two have another Baby!!!!   The only times when I came close to an accident while driving was when it was legal to talk on the phone. I made it my own rule over 10 years ago not to use the stupid thing when driving and my business partner and associates would get incensed when I would let it go to voice mail. I won't use the hands free (Blue teeth?)now as I need all the concentration I cam muster to drive these days. No Rick it's not old age it's all the ignorant and unskilled drivers they allow to drive today.  Can people just use common sense today? I still have friends that refuse to wear their seat belts in the truck or PFD in the boat. I even have a spare inflatable for them. Well they used to refuse, now they can drive themselves or buy their own boat and do what they wish.  How about if ignoramuses may be shot on sight?"

Let it operate in airplane mode at high speeds, and keep the emergency 911 function in tact.  Dragons den here I come Good idea  All good except for when a passenger is using their phone in a car! HH In theory it could work as long as the car has a hands free option and then the cell must be synced to the car every time you get in."

Let it operate in airplane mode at high speeds, and keep the emergency 911 function in tact.  Dragons den here I come Makes sense for sure. I don't have a problem with talking as mine's synced through F-150. All voice commands. But texting and driving is nuts. I don't get it, I'm not a cop but i see at least 20-30 drivers a day texting. Even one kid right beside a cop. Cop looks over and keeps driving. Until they start strictly enforcing this will remain an issue."
972989,manitoubass2,2016-06-09 18:58:00,11391,"OI I said keep 911 emergency intact. You obviously need that function.  And Goeff hit the nail one the head, sync the phone for the passenger or you cant use it to text/call."

972996,scuro2,2016-06-09 19:39:00,904,Upon conviction 6 demerit points like with drinking and driving or passing the school bus with lights flashing. In all three cases poor choices can lead fatal accidents. I wonder what insurance would be for an 20 year old guy with six demerit points?
972997,manitoubass2,2016-06-09 19:41:00,11391,"Not saying its right but police are allowed to use hand held devices in the vehicle. Yes its stupid and hypocritical.  Bluetooth is so widely available its shocking anyone chooses to ""physically"" txt a message nowadays.  Good on everyone that uses hands free devices and bluetooth.  I do think my idea is plausable and a good solution to eliminate the people txting and driving."
972998,manitoubass2,2016-06-09 19:44:00,11391,I disagree with fines etc solely because they are not eliminating the error.  You will still have many unecessary deaths/accidents.  Remove the problem at the source.
973001,Dara,2016-06-09 20:10:00,3052,"According to latest studies, and what I always believed, even hands free is distracting...its not the holding the phone, its the concentrating on the conversation instead of driving"
973003,manitoubass2,2016-06-09 20:20:00,11391,"Its literally no different than talking to a passenger  I say ""txt dad, lets go fishing""  My eyes have never once left the road nor my hands the wheel.  Same for phone calls  Its trying to grab objects, do alternative tasks etc while driving that bring added danger to the equation.  Also, some people just suck at driving. My friend for instance. Heading to work at dusk, gets distracted by grabbing his coffee. Looks up to see a deer. Instinct apperently tells him to veer into oncoming traffic and hit an 8ft ditch.  Not only is his truck totalled, he gets charged. Insurance goes up. Breaks a few ribs and misses time at work.  Thankfully nobody is dead nor involved in the incident.  All that, and all he had to do was actually hit the deer. Minimal damage all things considered."

Talking bussniess hands free, LEGAL, and asked a price or what not. Yup, I have it right here. Reaches over to grab the folder, takes EYES OFF the ROAD for a SPLIT second and WHAM. Rear ends someone."
973010,aplumma,2016-06-09 21:04:00,6896,I run a business from a cell phone and all of my trucks have hands free talking on it. The texting and internet are off limits while the truck is in gear. If you want to give me information like address or product names they send me a text that I answer at the next job before I go in. I see on average 80 % of the people driving distracted from putting on make up to searching the internet. It blows my mind that people think they can operate a vehicle with these distractions. I was rearended by a texter and the damage to my 2015 Transit was over $5000.00. The week it took for the repairs was a down week and I could not recover the lost wages unless I go to small claims court. Their text cost me over $3500.00 that is not fair in my opinion.  Art

973016,cheaptackle,2016-06-09 21:45:00,849,"The only way I think it'll ever work is if they start zero tolerance enforcement with a super steep scale for offences.  1st offence, 3 points, $500.00 and car impounded for a week.  Second offences, double all that and scoop the license for 6 months minimum.  3rd offence - license gone, car gone, and 60 days of 3 hots and a cot.  Sorry if I seem harsh, just know of too many (1 would be too many if ya think about it!) who've had tragic changes to their lives because someone had to LOL someone else instead of driving intelligently!  It ain't that hard to pull over if they gotta deal with it right now, whatever the issue is will still be there when they get to it.  They'll be more likely to get to it AND get home every time if they do pull over or ignore it till later! However, the easiest solution is to shut the dang phone OFF, BEFORE starting the engine.  I've seen me do it and it works!  Michael"

973023,John,2016-06-09 22:38:00,2956,"I'm not sure that there would be a workable way to impound the phone....the service providers, Bell, Rogers etc. would fight it to the Supreme Court. I understand that fines simply provide a certain level of pain, however, $400 is nowhere near enough pain. First offence should be 4 demerit points and $1000.00, automatic and no pleading in court. The level of pain would then be increased through their insurance company depending on whether the offender has had other driving issues. Second offence should be severe enough in terms of demerits that the offender loses driving privileges and will probably need to go to the secondary insurance market to obtain coverage and that is VERY painful. If I seem a little callous and passionate about this issue, I have seen first hand some of the carnage caused by those that choose to text and drive........"
973024,Fisherman,2016-06-09 22:42:00,7201,Problem is there's not enough cops to enforce the rules that are out there.  (Or maybe too many at the donut shop)
973027,FloatnFly,2016-06-09 23:33:00,1640,same could be said about all these new touch screen controls in vehicles now
