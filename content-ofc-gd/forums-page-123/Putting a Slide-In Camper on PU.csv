973488,JoePa,2016-06-13 17:50:00,179,Boy every year I have to put my slide-in camper on my PU truck - man I hate doing this - I have a Lance Camper and a F350 PU - I have to get the camper between the wheel wells and between two rubber bumpers in the front of the box - I end up going back and forth a dozen times to get the camper on the truck just right  Well the other day I go to do this - backing up while looking out the back window - I have my foot on the brake - but then as I'm backing my foot hits the gas pedal and the truck knocks the camper off a couple cement blocks that were under the lifting jacks - down comes the camper on the truck bed - I'm luck the camper didn't fall over on its side - it did danger the truck bed somewhat and broke the back window on the truck  Repairing the window is going to cost me 500 bucks - once I get the window fixed I'll have to try loading the camper again - I'm wondering does any one go through this every year and do they have some suggestions as to how it can be done safety - thanks

973620,BillM,2016-06-14 17:24:00,17367,Once it's centered up put a piece of tape on the camper and the rear window of the truck.  Will make lining it up next time a snap.   A lot easier with two people however.
