Normally don't bother with live bait there, but taking the young ones this time has me considering bringing some in. I doubt bringing them from home would work out to well with the ferry crossing/travel time involved. Anyone on the rock have any suggestions?  Thanks in advance."

974074,35Wailin,2016-06-17 23:04:00,59,Probably find bait in little current or maybe sheguinda as well.  Mindemoya or manitowning are also possibilities.
