971482,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-27 21:38:00,479,"Some ""journalists"" would do anything to sell a story. I read the non-story and had zero references to what the players were actually doing. Were they gambling or just passing through on their way to their hotel? The least he could have done is find out first before printing a story to cast them in a bad spotlight. I wouldn't be surprised if Casey stopped taking questions from him down the road.  Way to support the home team...what a loser.  In the meantime, it's nice to see DT busy. To watch the Raps or watch the Jays???"
971507,Rizzo,2016-05-27 23:52:00,4754,"should be a good one tonight, 50 50 in my opinion. If they win tonight tho, they still stand precisely zero percent chance of winning in game 7. Nonetheless, been a shaky but good run. Underachieved the first two series but gave the Cavs a bit of a scare in this round"

971537,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-28 02:34:00,479,Only down 12! It wasn't looking good when they were down 21. Nervous!  Lowry is feeling it tho!
971540,John Bacon,2016-05-28 03:00:00,3277,I think they are now.  Not a bad run though.
971559,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-28 04:07:00,479,"So many things to be proud of our Raps and the fans at the ACC certainly acknowledged the team with 2:30 left in the game, despite being down 21 pts. Even Lebron seemed to take notice of the cheering crowd after the end of the game. Perhaps for him to cement his greatness, he should play for us  Would be nice though.  Chin up for the Raps, they faced through so much adversity and taking two games from them says a lot. They'll be hungry again next year."
974022,dave524,2016-06-17 14:51:00,4508,"Not saying the Raptors should have beat the Cavs with their inconsistent play, but it's again looking like the Warriors vs the Cavs and Refs much like our series gave the impression of the Raptors vs the Cavs and Refs. Don't know if LeBron will get MVP but should definitely get an Academy Award for acting, watching his play he's lost a lot of my respect, flop artist.   Edit: don't they have a technical foul for embellishment ?"

974034,kickingfrog,2016-06-17 16:25:00,8333,So what about last year's Finals? Why only play 6 games? The refs make awful calls but the conspiracy theories are for crazy wives.

Earlier in the playoffs, it was every other day and now the finals are like every 3 days. lol  Game 7 ratings will be through the roof, but that many days in between kinda makes it anti-climatic.  I'm unsure who I'd want to win. Warriors with their season leading wins or LeFlop with his conquest to greatness..."
974057,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-17 19:06:00,937,Gstate better get the momentum back in game 7.

971009,kickingfrog,2016-05-25 04:40:00,8333,The Raptors are closer to the finals than the Warriors.
971031,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-25 13:12:00,479,"OKC dominated GSW. So impressive that it makes me scared if the Raps happen to get past the Cavs and face KD & OKC.  But this is how playoffs work, right? May the best team win, despite the refs making our Raps work overtime. The Raps certainly have more heart and determination than the raw talent of the Cavs.  I think tonight's game is going to be the most important one of the series. If they can't win tonight's game or lose by a close margin, they may not win in Game 7.  So many variables!  8:30pm start time."
971036,AKRISONER,2016-05-25 14:34:00,5558,"isnt this the way it always goes?  You have a legendary team like the Bulls...and then a team challenges or even beats their record, but then doesnt pull off the full repeat. Without the championship the warriors season means nothing, especially if you dont even make the finals.  seems like someone has finally solved the equation to currey and the small ball. Impressive coaching to say the least.  Remember when the patriots (colts? one of the two i dont watch football) were supposed to have the ""perfect season"" but then just got dummied in the superbowl.  The playoffs and the regular season are two very very different beasts. I think raptors fans knew this when we watched the first round this year. Whats more impressive is that the team has adjusted.  Most importantly is that defense wins playoffs, and GS is an offensive powerhouse.  Ever notice how the washington capitals never win?"
971040,GBW,2016-05-25 14:46:00,8460,"OKC dominated GBW. who did what to me?!?!?!?! I went fishing Monday with a few bud's and nobody ""dominated me"" there either"

I went fishing Monday with a few bud's and nobody ""dominated me"" there either  I'd pay to see a NBA 7 footer go man-o-a-man-o in a fishing tournament.  A dude that is taller than the avg length of a fishing rod would be epic indeed. hah  They'd also probably make awesome fishing partners when needing someone to hand you a net. hah No need to fumble up & down the boat, when the arm span of a 7 footer can just easily hand you the net. Or even reaching down to clear up the propellers."

971077,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-25 19:08:00,479,"I figure that would be close to the weight limit of a boat lol. 6'10"" prob be around 250lbs avg, 750lbs, plus yourself...maybe 180lb? So you're looking at over 900lbs lol."
971080,manitoubass2,2016-05-25 19:11:00,11391,The boat needs to be 5ft wider lol. Even a 20ft boat was unstable with these giants moving around lol

Although, it wouldn't be classic Raps if they didn't take one step forward and two steps back. lol Maybe their gut check got left behind at the border?  I feel confident with them winning Game 6, but Game 7 seems like small window. The Raps have stepped up to adversity and I'm sure they will do that again. Games 3 & 4 were such brilliant displays of competitiveness, whereas Game 5 was a total head scratcher.  Friday is gonna be a loud one in the city."
971197,manitoubass2,2016-05-26 08:04:00,11391,Im all for the raps but wow OKC really seems to have figured out golden state  Not sure if its true or not but I heard somewhere that if OKC didnt win this year durrant was lookin to sign in GS
971211,chessy,2016-05-26 13:12:00,610,some of the raptors were spotted at 2 am in a casino with a whole bunch of people .. one was Carrol.. what were they thinking
971217,AKRISONER,2016-05-26 13:41:00,5558,optics are not good on that one.  They played like they were hungover.  Just brutal
971231,netminder,2016-05-26 15:36:00,514,"optics weren't good, but the casino was attached to the hotel they were staying at. Also, the game was at 8:30, I'm sure they could shake off a hangover (if they were even drinking) by that time. I don't think it's a big deal. They're grown men and maybe couldn't sleep. I wonder how many times Jordan was spotted at a casino the night before a big game.  Anyway, if they keep playing like that on the road it won't matter what happens on Friday in game 6. They need to show up to play wherever they are."
970411,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-20 08:34:00,8243,Maybe not toast yet but they're ready to pop. I like Tory's letter. We could have taken the traditional Canadian position and said nothing and then just let the Yanks keep crapping on us.
970429,AKRISONER,2016-05-20 14:48:00,5558,"once again proving, unless you have bron bron, or steph, you aint winning jack!  It will be a very interesting offseason. I personally think that they are going to blow the team up. They accomplished what they can with this squad and achieved their realistic goal. I dont see them throwing a pile of money at derozan and lowry especially after their performances in the playoffs thus far have been so hit and miss."
970438,manitoubass2,2016-05-20 16:54:00,11391,^^^  Thats what sucks in TO  This is an awesome team lacking one big player.  Good luck getting that in TO though.  And both derozan and lowry are gonna be offered big bucks to move on(i wish theyd stay)
970559,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-21 19:37:00,479,"Anyone know why theOKC vs GSW had such a long break between Game 2 & 3? Raps and Cavs seem to be on that every other day. If I remember correctly, GSW & OKC played Wed and their game 3 is on Sunday. Sounds fishy to me."
970572,manitoubass2,2016-05-21 20:05:00,11391,"Yep, cleveland needs a rest before the finals"
970595,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-22 00:03:00,479,"unfortunately, that sounds about right. Game time starting soon and I'm sure the crowd will be behind the Raps from beginning to end.  Hopefully, it'll be enough to take a game or two."
970597,Rizzo,2016-05-22 00:10:00,4754,guy i work with paid $1000 bucks for one seat! That is nucking futs
970605,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-22 01:09:00,479,Looks like another Raps vs Cavs & Refs. Joseph got slashed by Jefferson huge and they didn't even call it.
970610,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-22 01:37:00,479,"Cory Joseph gets T'ed up when he was trying to hold back Biyombo lol. What a joke!  And despite it all, they're man-handling the Cavs. Hope they can keep it up in the 2nd half."

970613,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-22 01:42:00,479,"If the Raps win, it will be so much sweeter and will boost their confidence by leaps and bounds. Literally, Raps are playing handicapped. So sad. Biyombo is having a huge game! #WeTheOther"
970617,manitoubass2,2016-05-22 01:53:00,11391,Biyombo is beast! Gonna be a huge fan fav for sure!!! Love his passion
970623,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-22 02:59:00,479,"What a game! Even if the Raps lose this series, tonight's game shows how well they can play.  Hope they can tie it up on Monday.  Insane how bad the refs r still. This is a 1 seed vs 2 seed, but the refs treat them like an 8 seed team. So frustrating.  Biyombo was just incredible in tonight's game. DeRozan played awesome too!  The Thomson elbow to James face was the highlight. Haha. And the fact they tried to pin it on Carrol and giving the tech to Joseph..."

970629,dave524,2016-05-22 11:26:00,4508,"Wow talk about brutal officiating!  I swear the money changers at NBA central have sent the word down to the refs that they want an all American final, hell,  they got the whole NHL playoff series stateside , gimme a break"
970655,manitoubass2,2016-05-22 16:38:00,11391,"Honestly, ive seen bad calls, games in most sports that seemed ref lopsided etc.  But is this the most obvious officiating bias ever? Id say no but its pretty darn close"
970739,LeafsFan,2016-05-23 15:52:00,19,"Unlike the NHL, but similarly like MLB there is no money for a Canadian team to make it out of the first round.  Sure ratings for the raptors would be huge in Canada if they made it to the finals, but the NBA would much prefer to have an American finals so there will one interest on a national level (especially if it is at least one of the major city teams.  Having watched parts of most games, it seems that the following fits the bill ...  Was the foul against Toronto?  Yes.  Was it really a foul?  I mean really, it was more embellishment by Toronto than anything, so do not call it.  Was the foul against Toronto's opposition?  Yes.  Call it.  The great game of basketball has no room for this nonsense."
970797,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-24 01:37:00,479,"No matter how much the NBA/Refs/Cavs conspire, you can't stop the Raps Express! Rooting for them big time. Biyombo having another exclamation statement first half.  ZERO free throws in the first quarter. Can't even deny the possibility of collusion...ZERO! Smh..."

970817,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-24 03:13:00,479,"The Raps could have folded after the blowouts in Cleveland, but this group is showing their true grit. Wish Biyombo got a couple of shots...he had a few wide open chances, but he's still having a great series.  This win shows it just wasn't a fluke and when everyone thought the Raps were done, they come back and take two at home!  Still, was scary how the Cavs 3-pointers were coming in bunches near the end. Wow!  But I'm glad the Raps didn't try and match 3 pointers when they weren't shooting that well from beyond the arc. But ya, driving the bucket was such a thing to watch.  Defence was outstanding when it really mattered. Really impressive and playing against the Cavs&Refs.  And Raps fans are hands down way better than Cavs lol. Cavs fans were leaving the arena with still 5 mins left in the 4th quarter. Raps fans were in it from beginning till the end. Wow!"

969835,Rizzo,2016-05-16 11:36:00,4754,was able to catch the last quarter...now that's more like the team we saw all season! If these guys can finally break through all the nerves (and they've had 14 games to do it) they can give Cleveland a test.
969841,manitoubass2,2016-05-16 12:01:00,11391,"Oh I dont believe so. You might just soon find out. Their records dont mean anything come playoffs.  Cleveland is another beast  But yes, golden state is 2 levels up lol  The raps need to play on all cylinders and hope cleveland faulters to even have a chance.  I do however like the raps as underdogs. I believe it will inspire them.  Pressure is on cleveland not the raps"
969967,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-17 00:59:00,479,"I'm really enjoying watching Biyombo play in place of JV. He's got so much energy and puts in 110%. Sure, he probably is shooting around 50% FT for the playoffs, but I will take that having him there under the bucket. And he's great at the screen and running back to the basket to collect the rebound. Highlight for me was his dunk, blocked Wade's shot (with that Mutumbo finger wag haha), and a follow up dunk. That was epic! That big man can move!"
969993,manitoubass2,2016-05-17 04:52:00,11391,"Yep, I love guys like him  He is in might great shape and is playing 150%."
970002,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-17 10:53:00,479,Watched some highlight reels of Biyombo when he was with Charlotte and also came across this vid on YouTube:    What stood out to me was how genuine and happy he feels playing in the NBA. I hope he will stay a Raptor for many years down the road.
970003,dave524,2016-05-17 11:07:00,4508,What's up with Scola ? expected to see him more especially since the JV injury. As a mature player I would think his experience would be an asset in the payoff.
970034,ehg,2016-05-17 17:19:00,2666,Guess now a month later the Raptors aren't toasted yet. In the regular season in three games the Raptors went 2-1 against Cleveland.

CBS’s sports website has a massive error – it can’t even be called a typo – in their poll about who will win the NBA Finals. The poll asks “who will win the NBA title?” and classifies the Raptors as ‘other.’ It’s been two days since the Toronto Raptors defeated the Miami Heat in Game 7 on Sunday at 3:30 p.m., clearly enough time to get their facts right. But for now CBSSports.com categorizes the Toronto Raptors as ‘other,’ and naturally Raptors fans responded with #WetheOther making the hashtag trending on Twitter. Cue the outrage, Canada. As of 10 a.m. on Tuesday, the four-item poll was still available on the CBS website. An hour later – and after being called out multiple times on social media – it seemed CBS has created a whole new poll, one that omits the Eastern Conference finals completely.  Now, as of 1 p.m. on Tuesday, Raptors fans have clearly taken over the poll.     So go vote!!"
970042,John Bacon,2016-05-17 18:00:00,3277,Does this mean that a bet on the Warriors will pay 50:1

970387,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-19 23:48:00,479,We will really see what the Raps are made of after that first game blowout. Hope they will be able to adapt from the first game and put in a more competitive display.
970388,Rizzo,2016-05-20 00:02:00,4754,"definitely toast now...maybe get one game? Either way, they made it to where they needed to be. It was a bumpy road, and took far too long to dispatch of the Pacers but in my opinion making the Conference finals makes the season a success, anything less would have been failure."

They sure played better tonight, compared to game 1.  3rd quarter, Scola had a wide open path to the bucket. All he needed to do was take 2 steps for the dunk and he settled for a jumper and missed, grabbed his rebound and got fouled. Ended up sinking 1 of 2 FTs. That play stuck out in my head, amongst the many others lol."
968841,Rizzo,2016-05-07 15:23:00,4754,I was livid at the last play before regulation. Brutal.
968874,Rizzo,2016-05-08 00:40:00,4754,Lowry won me back over with his play tonight (still very disappointed in the last regulation play of game 2 tho...it was a total waste at a chance to end the game)
968879,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-08 01:23:00,479,"Huuuuge confidence booster fur the Raps! I hope JV can make it back out on Monday. Looked like Whiteside has the slightly more serious injury. Even if he does play Monday, don't know how effective he will be.  Two more wins!"
969293,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-12 02:49:00,479,"One more to go! Admittedly, I had my doubts when Miami clawed back from a 19pt/20pt deficit."
969309,dave524,2016-05-12 11:59:00,4508,"One more to go! Admittedly, I had my doubts when Miami clawed back from a 19pt/20pt deficit.  Yeah, it was slipping away until Lowry got that huge three from downtown Sault. Ste. Marie  with about a minute left."
969320,AKRISONER,2016-05-12 14:15:00,5558,"if lowry misses that 3 they lose   i was yelling at the TV in anger as he jacked that shot up. I was like NO what the hell ARE YOU OMGGGG YESSSSS!!!  friggin steph curry with the shot boi!  but seriously, stop jackin up jumpers from outside. Every single game they start getting tired and they start settling for outside jumpers. and every game the heat come back."
969321,PUMP KNOWS,2016-05-12 14:20:00,937,"We need to finish it in game 6, don't give them a chance in game 7"
969589,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-14 13:53:00,479,"Game 7 it is! I dunno why the Raps always make things difficult for themselves lol. They shoulda finished the Pacers in 5 and should have put away the Heat last night. I suppose it will feel much more satisfying to win at home, for the fans. I can only guess it will be rammed down in Jurassic Park on Sunday.  It's gonna be a good one and the bars are gonna make some nice coin that day too!"
969639,Rizzo,2016-05-14 19:26:00,4754,"always dramatic. For me, to be a successful year they have to beat the Heat. Lose this game I call it another disappointment. Win and I call it a success, even if they get swept by the Cavs next series"
969643,manitoubass2,2016-05-14 20:18:00,11391,"I cant watch basketball anymore, much like OI said.  I do watch the highlights and follow the scores.  The game changed to much (for the worse imo)  I think I watched for about 2 seasons after vince left the raptors.  I hope the raptors win. If not then golden state. I was a huge fan of tim hardaway so im just basing it on that lol.  That Curry is somethin else though. Boy can he shoot"
969723,Broker,2016-05-15 14:12:00,482,"If DD and Lowry are both on tonight, the Raps will win no doubt. If not, then its up in the air..."
969734,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-15 15:23:00,479,"I kinda wish that DD and KL would recognize if they're shooting bad, to pass the ball around to teammates that are shooting well. All those missed shot attempts could have been shots taken by Powell or Ross or JV and avoid the game 7 situation.  so many ifs"
969735,Rizzo,2016-05-15 16:00:00,4754,"...and of course my wife books me to be out while the game is on today. Could PVR it....but I think the horn honking, or distinct lack of horn honking will speak volumes. Or do people not care enough in Guelph to honk?"
969770,PUMP KNOWS,2016-05-15 21:09:00,937,LETS GO RAPTORS!!
969772,misfish,2016-05-15 22:05:00,29133,Need this kinda game next series. They just might get to the final.
969774,PUMP KNOWS,2016-05-15 22:15:00,937,
969775,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-15 22:31:00,479,"Usain Bolt!!! lol. Man, was such an awesome game! Go Raps!"
969777,leaf4,2016-05-15 22:44:00,2466,Great dominant game to watch!
969796,kickingfrog,2016-05-15 23:52:00,8333,I can put the smoke detector back up.
969797,manitoubass2,2016-05-15 23:53:00,11391,"Jeebus, they blew em out!  Next up, cleveland lol  Time for a horseshoe"
969804,dave524,2016-05-16 00:38:00,4508,"save the horseshoe for the Warriors and Curry, if they play like today, Cleveland is doable."
969805,manitoubass2,2016-05-16 00:48:00,11391,If they play like they did today they have a slight chance imo  Im rooting raps but cleveland is on another level.  Then again maybe cleveland plays bad?  Who knows?  Raptors vrs golden state would be epic
969815,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-16 02:28:00,8243,"The Mad Men are flipping out because it's a TO/Cleveland series and not Miami. Ratings are going to take a dive. Too bad, so sad."
969817,chris.brock,2016-05-16 02:39:00,4053,"  I think things are looking up for all Toronto pro sports teams, very cool, hopefully the curse is broken"

Who knows?  Raptors vrs golden state would be epic  I wouldn't say that they are on another level.  Cleveland finished the season one game again of Toronto.  But Toronto won the head to head series.  I think that puts them at about the same level.  Golden State is another level.       I think things are looking up for all Toronto pro sports teams, very cool, hopefully the curse is broken  Hopefully, I am glad I was wrong on that one.  I would love to see them in the final."
967870,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-27 15:45:00,479,"I was ready to watch the Jays play when the Raps were down 90-75, but the Jays were getting pounded by the White Sox and went back to watching the Raps. lol  Entertaining to say the least!  Paul George is still a monster tho...which shows one man can't take on a team. Still giving the Raps the edge over Pacers."
967877,PUMP KNOWS,2016-04-27 17:00:00,937,Too close for my liking but I'm happy they pulled it off.  I hope this game sparks some fire in them for game 6.
967879,netminder,2016-04-27 17:11:00,514,"I have no idea how they pulled this one off. Wow. Well done boys MEN! I only started watching once the 4th started, if you must know. I take full credit. What I saw, that game was fun to watch. Let's hope thy carry that momentum into Indiana."
968063,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-29 21:12:00,479,Game time @ 7:30pm...Rooting for the Raps!
968097,John Bacon,2016-04-30 01:28:00,3277,"I only started watching once the 4th started, if you must know. I take full credit. What I saw, that game was fun to watch. Let's hope thy carry that momentum into Indiana.  Maybe you should watch the fourth quarter tonight.  It looks like they need some help."
968100,kickingfrog,2016-04-30 01:57:00,8333,I smell burnt toast. Frustrating.
968104,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-30 03:29:00,479,"Embarrassing. Even if the Raps make it past the Pacers, the weaknesses of Lowry and DeRozan have been exposed. They certainly didn't play like a second seed team."
968123,netminder,2016-04-30 14:12:00,514, I'm was out for supper and got home at the start of the second half. Seems like I'm a bit of a double edged sword.
968128,Acountdeleted,2016-04-30 15:09:00,2562,"I hope they don't make it to the next round. I love the Raptors but they are playing like garbage. Really, with the last 2 games, they should be eliminated already."
968152,Rizzo,2016-04-30 22:11:00,4754,I puked a little in my mouth watching that
968174,John Bacon,2016-05-01 01:30:00,3277,"If they manage a win in game 7, they will probably go pretty quick, maybe in four, in the second round."
968273,Rizzo,2016-05-02 02:38:00,4754,"well they tried to give it away, but Indiana...well...they're Indiana. George ran out of steam (thank goodness). Sure hope the jitters are gone and the second round brings better things"
968274,PUMP KNOWS,2016-05-02 04:08:00,937,I'm happy they won but I didn't like how they ended this game.
968277,dave524,2016-05-02 10:38:00,4508,"For a moment I flashbacked to the Leafs -Bruins semifinals of , what was it 2012? Yeah they got it done, but not holding high hopes for further advancement. We watched them religiously  during the regular season, they were a team of 4th quarter rallies, not collapses"
968290,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-02 14:18:00,479,"Amazingly, the Raps sqeaked in there for the win, by doing just enough. DD didn't have a particularly good series, but I hope he finds his scoring touch when they face Miami. It was a nail biter for sure, especially with the missed foul call in the latest minute of play. Usually, the Raps are the ones who get the short end of the stick when it comes to missed foul calls nearing the end of a game. Feels good to be on the other side of that coin."
968291,AKRISONER,2016-05-02 14:32:00,5558,"For a moment I flashbacked to the Leafs -Bruins semifinals of , what was it 2012? Yeah they got it done, but not holding high hopes for further advancement.

968301,Carp,2016-05-02 16:34:00,1488,"They scared everyone for a bit, but held on for the win. Next .............."
968353,misfish,2016-05-02 22:40:00,29133,The real winner is the box office here.
968483,John Bacon,2016-05-04 03:08:00,3277,Well at least they didn't choke in the fourth.
968489,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-04 04:10:00,8243,"I have been trying to watch NBA ball lately and can't get into it. I Thought I would jump on the bandwagon but just can't get past a first quarter. I've lost my passion for it, I don't know why really, we were fanatics for Basketball. You took your ball everywhere with you, like skate boards today. I think it is great a new generation of fans are following The Raptors. I have been getting nostalgic lately. When I was in HS playing we were fanatics. We didn't have cable yet and only got 1 or 2 games on a Sunday. We would actually all crawl in the VW and 5 of us would shuffle off to North Tonawanda and invade my Noni's living room to watch a Braves game after the expansion. The poor woman. 14 teams then. Teams like Cincinnati Royals, San Fran Warriors, San Diego Rockets. We knew most all the starters on every team, heck there were only 14 until 1970 I think. Wilt Chamberlan, Lew Alcinder, Pistol Pete Maravich, Bob Lanier. Expansion teams were Cleveland, Portland and Buffalo in 70 or 71 to make it 17 teams.  If you owned a pair of Bob Cousey Converse it was like having the newest Air Jordans. There was a kid then in a Hamilton High School that could actually,,,,ready,,,, dunk a ball. He made the Spectator because of it. It was illegal then to dunk a ball in HS, University too if I remember, as if anyone could.  I am going to try to watch the next game."
968495,dave524,2016-05-04 11:11:00,4508,Lowry only had 7 points including the buzzer beater
968497,Steve,2016-05-04 11:22:00,2075,"yes, you can all kill me but.....  I hope the raptors get swept...so my Pearl Jam concert can go on as planned....  :)  I would have went for the raptors sweep instead, but that can't happen now lol."
968520,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-04 16:11:00,479,"Since the playoffs have started, the Raps  haven't really had all pistons firing. The commentators were mentioning how Lowry & Derozan have the lowest FG% during the playoffs amongst active NBA players. If they can somehow find their scoring touch again, things would be so different. The Raps are hanging in there because of the supporting cast...Valanciunas, Powell, Joseph, Ross and Biyombo being pretty huge on the rebounds too.  Some of the bricks that DD & KL have been putting up are pretty embarrassing lol. They've been getting good open looks, but can't seem to sink it down. And what's up with using up 12 seconds of the shot clock??? Oh man, drives me bonkers! Dribble-dribble, hangout at half court for like 7 seconds, when they should setting up for a play. Excruciating! They did that against Pacers and they did that again last night and they end up jacking up a hail mary with 3 seconds on the shot clock...what the hell???  As much as I wanna see the Raps succeed into the next round, championship calibre teams don't do silly stuff that the Raps do. Although, Miami did have a few brain farts of their own, which pushed it to OT. lol  Still rooting for the Raps, because we know DD & KL could play better than what they've shown so far."
968561,Rizzo,2016-05-04 23:39:00,4754,Raps looked like the first round raps. Miami was worse than I expected...don't think they will be that bad the rest of the series (Miami I mean)
968775,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-06 15:08:00,479,"Sure wasn't pretty, but a win is a win. DD and KL are still struggling. Had they made their FTs, OT could have been avoided altogether. Even KL's last shot at the end of the game was a real head scratcher. The guy had no intention of making a play and going into OT.  But definitely give credit to their defence. They kept Miami scoreless for almost the entire duration of OT lol.  Hopefully, the Raps can pick up a win on the road."
966676,Rizzo,2016-04-17 00:40:00,4754,...cuz I do. They REALLY needed that one.
966677,FloatnFly,2016-04-17 00:47:00,1640,holy negative nancy much???? its the first damn game
966678,leaf4,2016-04-17 00:56:00,2466,Sound the alarm!
966679,Rizzo,2016-04-17 01:07:00,4754,"Before the game I would've said raps in 6...and I sure hope this still happens. But after seeing this result I wonder if this really is game 1, or is it a continuation of the past (nets, wizards). For the mostpart this is still very much the same team that suffered those defeats at the hands of lower seeds. They needed this game to break that stigma, so in my opinion, its not just ""one game"". This game had far more meaning than that."
966680,manitoubass2,2016-04-17 01:51:00,11391,"Raptors all the way (i wish)  They really built a great team, too.  So awesome to see."
966681,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-17 02:00:00,479,"I'd think it's just the first game jitters of Derozan and Lowry. Like the announcer said, it was very uncharacteristic from the pair to shoot 8/32 combined  lol. Even I find that shocking. If they went 16/32, it would have been a different outcome. And JV going huge on the boards, that's definitely not something from last year's team.  So many times the Raps were out rebounded, but this is different and we will most definitely see it.  Hopefully, Raps in 5, but probably will go the distance to 7 games. It was a close one and it really could have gone either way. George was just on a whole different level. If he was playing NBA Jam, the net would def been on fire. I'm sure we will see that with Derozan and Lowry."
966686,GBW,2016-04-17 02:16:00,8460,"how do you catch them, topwater, are those what you call ""foul"" hooked fish or...?"
966700,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-17 04:18:00,8243,"Who, what are raptors?"
966712,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-17 13:50:00,479,"Raptors are a Canadian basketball team. You know, basketball-the game invented by a Canadian by the name of James Naismith, in 1891. Old Ironmaker, I thought perhaps u graduated from the same class as him."
966719,manitoubass2,2016-04-17 15:20:00,11391,Hahahahahah
966738,muddler,2016-04-17 20:33:00,623,Winners don't forget how to win. This team will be fine. I'll start to panic if they loose the next two games. It ain't gonna happen. Lots can happen in 7 games. This team is too good to get knocked out by the Pacers.  muddler
966744,GBW,2016-04-17 21:31:00,8460,"Raptors are a Canadian basketball team. You know, basketball-the game invented by a Canadian by the name of James Naismith, in 1891. Old Ironmaker, I thought perhaps u graduated from the same class as him. Oh now THAT WAS GOOD!!!!!!!!"
967023,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-20 01:59:00,479,"JV has been a monster so far! I sure hope Demar finds his groove in this series. JV to the Pacers is how Paul George is to the Raps. Just two unstoppable players. The bounce back game sure was good, but we all knew they were better than what the score was showing from Game 1. It's fun watching a team that's enthusiastic and passionate of playing. Even though Casey pulled Demar out in the 4th, he had none of that All-Star attitude and was still engaged with the game."
967031,PUMP KNOWS,2016-04-20 03:32:00,937,Just let them play and let them figure it out.  Second place in the east and they didn't play like garbage to get to that position.
967205,Rizzo,2016-04-21 23:16:00,4754,game 3 in half an hour...bring it on! Need at least a split in Indy so get it out of the way and win tonight
967232,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-22 03:32:00,479,I think there's little doubt who the better team of this series is. lol But it's always the question of if they could maintain this kind of effort in a 7-game series.  Good game!
967475,dave524,2016-04-24 02:01:00,4508,They sure didn't show up to play today
967517,smitty55,2016-04-24 15:45:00,928,"They sure didn't show up to play today Yea, that's for sure. Brutal in fact. I've watched two games so far, the first and fourth. My bad luck. Makes me wonder how they even made the playoffs.  Cheers"
967519,Rizzo,2016-04-24 16:58:00,4754,...lucky me...the games I saw were 2 and 3.
967826,dave524,2016-04-27 00:11:00,4508,and game 4 continues at home  edit: somebody lit a fire under them in the 4th
967829,muddler,2016-04-27 00:55:00,623,"Wow, what a comeback. I was sure we were done. Great game.  muddler"
967831,Rizzo,2016-04-27 01:20:00,4754,not sure I would call it a great game...but glad we won!
967833,Fisherpete,2016-04-27 01:34:00,1814,I have no idea how they pulled this one off. Wow. Well done boys MEN!
967848,Acountdeleted,2016-04-27 12:14:00,2562,That win does not make me confidant for the future. It was a heck of a comeback but it could easily be 3-2 for the Pacers with the Raptors facing elimination.
967852,grimsbylander,2016-04-27 13:17:00,3016,The Pacers are the ones putting up the points but it's the Raptors beating the Raptors. They're playing so damn tight.
