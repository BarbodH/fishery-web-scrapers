Police say they were called to St. Lawrence Park around 10:30 Monday, after a family had been involved in a full fledged argument. Apparently a woman was insisting the earth was flat and her boyfriend's father was arguing it is round. Police say the 56-year-old man became so angry he started to throw things into their camp fire, including a propane cylinder. Brockville Fire was called in to put out the blaze and at some point the man left the scene. Police say they are now looking for him in order to charge him with mischief. Investigators say ""neither party would change their views."""
973649,manitoubass2,2016-06-14 20:16:00,11391,What in the????
973650,FrankTheRabbit,2016-06-14 20:20:00,479,"Lol seriously???  Ok, the girlfriend should have her tubes tied and not be allowed to further contaminate the human gene pool lol. That almost reads like a National Enquirer article."
973657,leaf4,2016-06-14 20:59:00,2466,"Lmao that is ridiculous, although a friend's younger brothers gf is dead set on believing that ""mockumentary"" on mermaids that discovery did a few years back hahahaha"
973667,manitoubass2,2016-06-14 22:24:00,11391,"No names,  But I think a board member here might have caused this???"
973677,ketchenany,2016-06-15 00:09:00,3229,"I'll bet, they were drinking out of round bottles!"
973708,Rizzo,2016-06-15 01:06:00,4754,"this is a big thing right now, I actually know a few people who believe in a flat earth. There are lots of videos out there on the subject"

There are lots of videos out there on the subject   Any of them explain why when you are on a boat on a big ""flat"" lake you see the tops of the trees before the land?"
973718,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 01:44:00,11391,"Probably not, because they dont think rationally.  I seen this debate on fb and it hilarious people could believe such things.  I just asked them for directions because I really wanted to try parachuting off earth to see what it looks like from below."
973719,grimsbylander,2016-06-15 01:45:00,3016,"Absolutely ridiculous. Of course the earth is flat, just ask anyone with a tiller."
973721,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 01:50:00,11391,"Makes sense, since everone with a console believes in shapeshifting reptilians???"

973723,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 01:58:00,11391,???
973730,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-15 03:22:00,8243,100% true because I read it on the internet.
973731,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 03:49:00,11391,You know how to use the interwebs?

973735,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 04:41:00,11391,A propane tank is not gonna blast off on a lil fire.  Those tanks strong as ....  Still amazingly stupid but..  Ive used propane tanks with tiger torches to heat other propane tanks all the time mining.  Could I die? Yes. Logically though it wont happen.  Those tanks are very well designed  It would take intense heat to blow one up(dont try it though lol)

973757,SirCranksalot,2016-06-15 13:58:00,3291,Some of those people should be taken to the edge of the earth and thrown off!!!
973765,Headhunter,2016-06-15 14:51:00,5703,"In something of a similar vein, I have a neighbour who believes that the earth is only 5 thousand years old! He's highly intelligent, very aware of his life and surroundings, yet insists that the dinosaurs roamed the earth less than 5 thousand years ago. Will argue that carbon dating is a man made tool that is completely wrong and the the dino's were only on earth for a very short time. How about that for a belief structure? HH"
