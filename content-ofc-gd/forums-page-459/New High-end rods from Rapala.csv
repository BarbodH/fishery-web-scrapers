Five spinning and three casting models.  http://www.rapala.ca/news/press/images/branding.jpg  Some people saw these at I-Cast back in July, and Tackle Talk has tested one already. These definitely aren't cheap! The rods are supposed to sell around $250.00, which is reasonable given that they have all of the latest high-end components... New Fuji SK2 reel seats, Fuji Titanium Frame, K-Series Tangle-Free Concept Guides with SiC guide ring inserts etc.  These are Rapala Canada items and I don't think they are available in the USA."
