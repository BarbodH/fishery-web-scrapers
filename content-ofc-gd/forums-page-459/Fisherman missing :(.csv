621573,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-14 23:07:00,130, that is a good idea. I wear mine when I am solo for sure but am too loaded up with fishing gear. A whistle and the blanket (does that work in water?) are a good idea. Whistle is a great idea actually. IDK what a tiny flashlight would do.
621579,GBW,2011-09-14 23:38:00,8460,I swear a whistle is mandatory to have in the boat at all times.  either on the person or in reach.  all my life jackets have one on them
621597,woodenboater,2011-09-15 01:02:00,2277,"The flashlight is very key. Had friends making a late season whitewater run in eastern Ont. a few years back. Something happened and they had to hoof it out on foot and light was dropping fast at that time of the year. They had a single light I believe but another would have been very handy. I've never used it for such but it could be THE difference if you're out floating around and you can hear air rescue searching for you. Blink the light in standard sos and hopefully a spotter will see you.  I also like Irish's practice of tying onto a rope so if you did end up out of the craft, the boat won't drift away, presuming the kill switch did shut the motor off as well. Just haul yourself back and scramble aboard."
621701,tonyb,2011-09-15 14:18:00,1637,"Sheesh, these are never good posts to see.  My thoughts go out to the family of the missing angler, such a terrible tragedy to have a loved one go missing like this.    There is a better solution! A Wireless Kill switch will shut down the engine should you fall overboard.  Couple that with an auto-inflateable PFD and even if you hit your head and got knocked out on your way overboard, you would be bouyant and floating with your head out of that water and drifting with your boat until you resume conciousness or someone spots you.  Wireless Kill Switch - http://www.autotether.com/at/how-it-works    Please, if you're going to be fishing solo on big water, make sure you have a safe and suitable vessel, up to date safety equipment, share your trip plan with someone on shore, and WEAR an auto-inflateable PFD ( http://www.mustangsurvival.com/recreational/inflatable-pfd-hydrostatic-inflation-technology-hit-0?division=recreation) at all times.

620413,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-12 00:15:00,130,"Yep, all someone has to do is loose their balance (have a dizzy spell, get light headed, rogue wave) once and fall in on a windy day that moves the boat away. The nuke plant is fairly busy water too but it looks like that was not much of a safety net.  not that I fish the big lakes but the rope thing is a good idea, does it get in the way? makes me think about keeping the 2-way attached to me."
620414,irishfield,2011-09-12 00:20:00,26272,I caught myself one too many times loading the rigger standing on my boarding platform.. realizing that hydraulic steering wasn't coming back for me when I slipped off... and I can't swim at 2 mph!  10 foot mooring rope tied to my belt attached on the rear cleat. Lets me get to the steering wheel. If I fall off...I either get dragged 'till I drown or pull myself back on board. Either way family gets me back !  Years of wearing a fresh air hood with hose attached has me programmed for not getting the rope twisted up and wrapped around my feet.

I heard the call from prescott this morning There was another in my vicinity while trolling that was stranded, two on board a vessel stranded. I heard the replies to assist them. I was ready to go without hesitation. To all here on OFC , if im out there, I will assist in any manner possible.Ive been there and its not fun at all. And I listen in. For some of you guys for future reference. Bronte harbour has had a call out for assistace, a charter captain from another board did assist untill the ccg arrived, venturing out of port weller. Time of arrival within1.25 hrs. Half way in between there is another 2 vessels that should of assisted, and should of been on alert Sorry for my little rant."

There is a handfull of guys I know that would be heading to the nuke for a night fish launching out of Whitby.  I never saw the lake, but an east wind like Bill said, is a bad wind for that area.

Search and rescue officers from Trenton, the Durham police marine unit and other officers searched the waters and shoreline on Monday.  Police say no trace was found of the missing 42-year-old Oshawa man and the investigation will remain open as a missing persons case.  Police believe the boater launched his five-metre aluminum fishing boat from the public launch in Whitby on Friday evening.  Late Saturday afternoon, Toronto police found an empty boat floating about two kilometres south of Ashbridges Bay.  The missing boater's truck and trailer were found in Whitby at the harbour and members of his family have been notified"

Lake Ontario is a cold lake even in the hot summer and can claim even the most skilled and prepared. There is always a chance that he does not want to be found. It has been done before.

621571,woodenboater,2011-09-14 22:49:00,2277,"I hope they find him somewhere out there, cold and shivering but alive. If the waves were steep and the wave period really short, it'd be an uphill battle not taking in water though.  Speaking of pfd's. How many have a minimalist ditch kit in theirs ? I used to keep three small signal flares and an emergency space blanket in my old pfd. Current one has a whistle on a zinger, a Spyderco knife (can be opened one handed) and if I remember to pack it , a small waterproof flashlight and firestarter. For whitewater runs in the spring/fall and winter, a few more things make the trip."
