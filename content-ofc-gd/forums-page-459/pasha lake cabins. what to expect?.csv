The locals make sure they keep their good spots a secret so do some exploring and be prepared to work a bit. If you're in good physical shape and can carry a small boat or canoe into a back lake, you should find decent fish."

649708,irishfield,2011-12-20 02:16:00,26272,"Looks like some great waters... why fellas with electric trolling motors would get out and push their boats, that's another story!"

Their boats are the right size for that lake but if you bring a 5 hp motor it will get you into a lot of smaller lakes where the resort has boats stashed. On one of our secret lakes we caught an average of 25 fish an hour each but we had to carry our motor, gas and equipment about a half mile...As far as I know the jackfish has a two fish limit and a slot size..."
