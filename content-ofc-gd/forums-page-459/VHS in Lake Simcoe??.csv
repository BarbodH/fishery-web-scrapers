649138,Skipper D,2011-12-17 15:36:00,1970,"  Same problem , Adobe reader acting up , gona switch to my other computer ."
649204,danbouck,2011-12-17 20:48:00,4380,"I just read this from a local bait shop  ""The OMNR is screwing with the bait supply once again. VHS disease has reportedly been found in Lake Simcoe, causing the OMNR to form a ring around Lake Simcoe, no bait in or out,Simcoe bait can only be used locally, not a problem, if you are living in and fishing Lake Simcoe, What this means,, there is a small area, on South Central Ontario that is considered a Virus Free Zone,, of which Waterloo Region is apart of, this means that we will no longer be able to import Emerald Shiners ( Pinheads ) to our location,, that in itself is not so bad. What is bad, is that the OMNR has given the bait harvesters a 2 week notice of this, now my supplier, has his ponds full of Emerald shiners that he can;t sell after Jan 1 2012 and of course it is not possible to fill his ponds with Local Creek bait, in that short notice."""

649230,Sharkbait22,2011-12-17 22:46:00,297,Is Ontario the last province to allow bait fish as bait? Many have also gone barbless I think. If no one bought minnows there wouldn't be a market.
649241,Skipper D,2011-12-17 23:36:00,1970,"After reading the link in this post this afternoon  i'd have to agree with Roy and others . What ever needs to happen needs to happen and run its course . I would venture to ask  for the fun of it , then maybe not ...... every one from this forum who fish's Lake Simcoe if they notice any thing peculiar with any or all of thier catch's this pass season . For my self who spent all my  time on the lake and out of every thing i brought out of the lake , i only had one the hole season that showed any thing like the symptoms shown in the link . Kind of like who better to ask for a little peace of mind then the anglers who fish it every day ."
649281,dhickey,2011-12-18 03:25:00,1038,VHS has been a concern with Simcoe for several years. About 4-6 years ago there was a massive die off of baitfish in particuler shiners it was the start of VHS rumours. I cant say for shure wheather it was VHS or not.But It did catch our attension.!!  The one thing I dont understand is that in the regs. I beleive it says that live bait is not to be transported outside or into the region your fishing in as well as bilge water. (No???) 40yrs ago when my Father started teaching me how to fish this was rule #1?  What HAPPENED????   So my piont is that there are signs on the hyways warning people of the restricted area concerning the Asian Longhorn Beatle so why not signs warning uninformed anglers of invasive spieces or posible viral threats?? On hyways leading out of metropolitan areas?  This would promote knowladge of current threats to native ecologies as well as helping to raise awerenes to inexperianced anglers as well as those that dont fish but enjoy getting out of the urban setting. Therfore spreading the concern throughout a whole community not just those involved in fishing. Creating change and involvment in order to preserve a natural resorce.  So..  If YOU drive more than 20 minniuts to go fishing buy your live bait when you get to your fishing spot.(local bait store) Most credible bait shops are open well before dawn and more than willing to reserve bait request along with customer service that extends well beyond posted hours of opperation.  This view is not based on science but.  I would like to think that my DAD tought me properly
648974,TJQ,2011-12-16 20:20:00,7806,"I heard today that the MNR MAY (and I stress may have) have confirmed Lake Simcoe to have VHS. Has anyone else heard this??? The reason I'm asking is that IF (and I mean if) it does, does that mean bait businesses there will sell their minnows to travelers along the highway that bring infected bait further north, ie to Lake Nipissing.. or the Muskokas? or even Temagami for Ice fishing??  Can anyone verify this??  http://publicdocs.mn...chment_ID=25952  Like I said, I'm not sure about this, but it would be sad if true."
648981,BillM,2011-12-16 20:31:00,17367,"If it had VHS, I'd think they ban anyone from gathering bait from the lake."
648983,TJQ,2011-12-16 20:37:00,7806,You would hope so.. I dont know much about the bait regulations..
648985,BillM,2011-12-16 20:38:00,17367," Me either, let's just hope that's what they do, lol"
648987,aniceguy,2011-12-16 20:40:00,1094,"When we had an issue on the credit a few years back, all fish passage, movement and collection was stopped If it is concenred here is a fact shet on bait movement http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001351.pdf it is listed to efect Walleye, Yellow Perch, Muskellunge, Smallmouth Bass, Rock Bass, Chinook Salmon, White Bass, Black Crappie, Freshwater Drum, Round Goby, Gizzard Shad, Emerald Shiners, Bluntnose Minnows and Spottail Shiners, so if it is confirmed there is a serious problem now in simcoe add gobies to the mix and lady simcoe is in some trouble"
648989,mike rousseau,2011-12-16 20:46:00,4661,It's hard to stop things like VHS...  Cause it's legal for joe blow to trap or purchase minnows... Then he can take them anywhere he wants...spreading the disease...  No matter how hard the rest of us try... Some uneducated angler at some point will cross contaminate different water bodies...
648991,bigugli,2011-12-16 20:46:00,6138,"Sadly, Simcoe, the Kawarthas, the Muskokas, have connection to both Huron and Ontario via the Trent/Severn waterway. Sadly, whatever was in the Great lakes will make its way into inland waters. It only takes a few years."
649005,Raf,2011-12-16 21:31:00,3495,can't they build an electric vhs barrier?
649011,misfish,2011-12-16 21:40:00,29133,"The minnows came in heavy this year at the local marina.There was a bait sucker truck there alot.Guess IFit,s true,it going to be transfered."
649033,Roy,2011-12-16 23:05:00,13728,Unfortunately I don't think there's a lot anyone can do about this. The knee jerk reaction would be to ban the sale of minnows in all of the province. Make it illegal to use minnows as bait for fishing. That ain't going to happen. And all we'd need is ONE person who has no clue to go trap his own and go fishing...anywhere he pleases and the whole effort is shot down. I'm afraid they'll/we'll have to let it run its course and maybe find a cure for it. I don't know.
649058,Rod Caster,2011-12-17 00:41:00,5784,There's no fish up north... STAY AWAY!   Problem solved TJ.
649082,TJQ,2011-12-17 03:40:00,7806," Ya .. thats it, no reason to bring bait.."
649085,Skipper D,2011-12-17 03:57:00,1970,"I think i read all the posts but still have'nt a clue what VHS is , i can guess and thats no good ....... ??????"
649088,kickingfrog,2011-12-17 04:13:00,8333,"All you need to know is that beta was better then vhs, but we still ended up with vhs."
649090,Skipper D,2011-12-17 04:24:00,1970,"Thats great , now all our fish are friggin addicted to watching movies ."
649092,mercman,2011-12-17 04:35:00,7054,  Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS)   
649093,kickingfrog,2011-12-17 04:39:00,8333,"Thanks, I'm at a Christmas party and I've had way to much to drink to explain viral hemorrhagic septicemia"
649101,Roy,2011-12-17 07:35:00,13728,Texting a fishing board while at a Christmas party. It must be a really good party eh Rob?
649109,outllaw,2011-12-17 10:56:00,1232,"TJ.. Sadly the vhs, among a whole pile of things will creep across canada. When we tried to deal with the goverment factions, they just dont listen. Policticians have short life cycles 4yr. they reallynever concern about our future. Unless there making money..From birds carrying disease to fish migrating,to ships ballast dumped. Sadly resources in canada seem to have lo values. to us guys its priceless."
649110,SmokestackLightnin,2011-12-17 11:17:00,390,Here is a release from Cdn Food and Drug on 2007 testing results:  http://epe.lac-bac.g...p/200709e.shtml  Lake Simcoe was a sample test site but the fish from Lake Simcoe were in an advanced state of deterioration and were not tested.
649113,kickingfrog,2011-12-17 13:16:00,8333," Great party. After a long work week, 3 hours of driving, 5 hours of drinking, eating too much of the biggest shrimp I have ever seen, I hit the wall. Eight hours sleep and I'm ready for my friends kids hockey game at the Tillsonburg arena."
649114,Handlebarz,2011-12-17 13:22:00,3790,"  Yes Raf I hear they have one on order it will be 5 years to late and they will build it at the mouth of Lake O. For the ones who don't know this is   VHS was seen by us here as a very bad thing when it first hit LSC but I must say the musky we lost have come back and they are getting bigger maybe its not the worst thing out there??? Maybe it kills the sick or week fish I have no idea but do know our musky fishing has been getting back to where it was before the die off with lots of snot rockets and shakers (20-36"" musky) and all fish seem to be chunkier  and healthy.  Maybe VHS is like gobies when they first came here everyone thought they were the end of the Great lakes but they cleaned them up and made the fish fatter.  Just my ramblings if it does get into there then there could be a bright side to it I hope it does not happen but there is something to look forward to.  One last thing ask the guys on the east and west end of Lake O how the musky are coming back they seem to be happy with the ones they are getting."
649115,NAW,2011-12-17 13:28:00,4022,"I was talking to the owner of the Rack and Reel yesterday.  She said that her bait supplier got some sort of notice about VHS.  He hasn't gotten a letter yet saying that he can't sell minnows, but is expecting one.  I guess they are talking about making Lake Simcoe a ""zone"" where minnows that are harvested locally, can only be sold locally.  Of coarse, like TJ said, it doesn't stop the consumer from taking them where ever they want..  I also herd, that the MNR is really going to crack down on the 120 minnow Max. law this year."
649129,Billy Bob,2011-12-17 15:13:00,5865,"In NYS we just got our minnow purchasing problems lifted somewhat...  For the last 3-4 years we could only purchase ""Certified Minnows"" (each one had to bear the NYS stamp....LOL).....this so called certified bait came in from Wisconsin and was VERY expensive and were not most times Emerald Shiners but rather ""golden shiner"" that did not work anywhere as well as the real stuff from Erie while perch fishing...  The rules were, you could NOT transport bait over the road unless it was certified and you had a receipt showing it was indeed certified...so that counted out Emerald Shiners from the Niagara River that is a must while perch'n on Lake Erie.  However, around June 1st this year the DEC FINALLY lifted the ban on selling Lake Erie Minnow and other minnows as long as you only transport said minnows in the bait corridor....good rule and it makes sense....but after the initial discovery of VHS in Lake Erie it has not been detected since....so that help with a LOT of political pressure from all our hunting/fishing clubs not to mention the Federation that most of them all belong to.  Bottom line, I can now ""legally"" dip my own bait in the Niagara and transport it over land to use in Lake Erie, thus saving hundreds of dollars in bait costs and or fines....  Here's the site that deals with our bait regs....scroll down about half way on the page....  http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/47282.html  Also if a bait dealer sells uncertified bait he CANNOT have certified bait for sale and visa versa.  Bob"
649130,Skipper D,2011-12-17 15:14:00,1970,"Thanks guys for bringing me up to speed , now i understand how every one eles feels . Second question "" maybe a pm for this anwswer"" how is it that they can tell theres a problem in the fish ?"
