649508,Roy,2011-12-19 15:01:00,13728,Sorry to hear about that but please don't put that knife back in the butter plate.
649537,cwpowell,2011-12-19 17:07:00,265,  LOL It really does look like the knife came straight from the butter plate.
649538,SylvanOwner,2011-12-19 17:12:00,266,Sorry to hear about your pet.   So...are you getting a replica done?
649557,drwxr,2011-12-19 19:05:00,453,it looks like it's laying on the cutting board ready to be filleted...

Still young at heart and wait with mouths open to drop food in their mouths. These fish under proper water and food care can live in more than 30 years.You never get tired of the gum line,just plain nasty!"
649913,spinnerdoc,2011-12-20 21:27:00,556,"Sorry for your loss bud, I lost mine last year. Had her for about 8 years..."
649919,DundasSteelheader,2011-12-20 21:43:00,166,"Sorry to hear that, until now I had never even heard of piranhas being pets!"
649950,Jer,2011-12-20 23:05:00,1426,"   I think for something to be considered a ""pet"", you need to be able to actually ""pet"" it.  I'm sorry for your loss, but it really is just a bluegill with teeth."
649959,tb4me,2011-12-20 23:53:00,3295,"Sorry for your loss..I had my Oscar die while away on holidays..My neighbour was looking after things and I suspect he wasnt, cause when I got home Oscar was on the floor completely dried out long dead..He was 5 at the time and had a long life ahead of him yet...However there is a silver lining to a grey cloud..Burry him under a rose bush or your favorite plant in the yard..Makes exellent compost over time.."
