649421,WalleyeSlayer,2011-12-19 00:17:00,26,Chuck and I headed out for a last kick at the can before the freeze up today. We headed out at noon from the Deseronto boat launch. We had been trolling for 2 hours into the wind up Long Reach and not a sniff on any of the lines. We turned to make our trek back midway from Sherman's Point and Huffs towards Deseronto and within 5 minutes we had our first fish on … It looked like a big fish the way it was fighting and pulling the board almost underwater. It soon surfaced and we had out first fish in the boat. A nice 11.5 pound Hawg off a Purple TD-11      We continued trolling for 2 more hours without a sniff until we were about 15 minutes from calling it a day. The board with goes back … FISH ON! It gave me an awesome fight and stayed down the whole time. I couldn't budge it at all … after a long great fight she finally surfaced boat side and she was ours. A nice 12.5 pound Hawg!      Both Hawgs were successfully released unharmed and with that note we ended our day with 2 monsters in 4 hours. It was an awesome time fishing with great friends this fall season and I can't wait to hit the hardwater this season with each and every one of em!!!  Aadil

649506,BillM,2011-12-19 14:57:00,17367," Hold any fish 2ft from your body and it will look like a monster    Steelhead guys do this all the time, lol!!!!"
649512,blaque,2011-12-19 15:34:00,2419," Ya i was taking the ""hold out"" into consideration and still thought it looked bigger than 12.5 lol.  I was viewing on a phone at the time, which for some reason made it look bigger.....now that i got it up on a desktop she looks more like it.  Doesnt change my jealousy however"
649784,WalleyeSlayer,2011-12-20 12:02:00,26,"Thanks guys  She sure was a nice one!  As for holding her, I'd rather hold her and show her and me in the picture then 8273628 acres of useless land water in the background that isn't relevant for the photo. Thanks again!  Aadil"
