648852,BillM,2011-12-16 04:06:00,17367," Neoprene are great in the winter.  The breathables have neoprene booties anyhow, so I'm failing to see how a set of breathables would have worked any better in this situation..."
648887,bassnass,2011-12-16 13:58:00,174,"Unless you're running around without wading boots - all that soft neoprene is protected.  I've owned both neoprene and breathables -- breathable are WAY more durable.  I don't know how many times I've slid down a bank or wading into a submerged stick and thought ""Oh, that did it"" - but still, no holes.  And they're WAY easier to get in and out of.  Mine also have built-in gators that perfrom flawlessly and the included wading belt also acts as a back supporter."
648896,solopaddler,2011-12-16 14:32:00,8605,"  All due respect, but wow you couldn't be more wrong."
648905,BillM,2011-12-16 15:11:00,17367," I have a set of Simms G3's... I know all about breathables..   What I'm saying is, if he had a hole on the top of his toe, it's got nothing to do with if the waders were breathables or not..   They all have neoprene booties...."
648925,Billy Bob,2011-12-16 16:38:00,5865,"Neoprene, at least quality neoprene waders that I use for duck hunting have proven over time to be very durable....want to test waders...the swamp I hunt is like a proving ground for waders....logs, sticks you name it....it's under there and you can't see it, unlike a clear trout stream. Haven't had a leak yet...."
649071,spinnerdoc,2011-12-17 02:16:00,556,"Yeah they are great in the winter I'd say, the few times that i went last year it was great..."
649073,spinnerdoc,2011-12-17 02:20:00,556,"I can olny speak for neoprenes, as they are the only one's I've ever had, for a long time and had no issues with it until now"
649363,bassnass,2011-12-18 16:36:00,174,"So Spinnerdoc - you've never owned breathables?  What about you BillyBob?  I don't understand why people are talking about the neoprene booties - they're in the boot.  Protected from holes being punched by logs, etc.  Solopaddler - care to elaborate?  My first pr of waders were neoprene (mid-range, as far as quality & price point) and I was wading in cattail swamps trapping 'skrats.  It wasn't long before they had holes punched in them.  These breathables I now own (yes, with neoprene booties) have positively thrilled me.  I also found neoprene warm, yes - but not less warm than layering up (or down) under my breathables.  Also - I tended to sweat in neoprene and then peeling those things off (slash - putting them on) was always a bit more a struggle than my breathables.  I dont' think I'd purchase neoprene again, but, as always, I'm open to hearing input."
649376,Billy Bob,2011-12-18 17:48:00,5865,Never had or knew anyone that has Breathable Waders.....might be good for warm weather fishing....  Everyone here is using the neoprene waders for duck hunting....but you might be onto something...don't know...  Here's the waders that have held up VERY well for me several years now.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cabelas-Ultimate-Hunting-Chest-Waders-150-Regular/749353.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2F%3FN%3D%26No%3D100%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dwaders%26Ntx%3Dmode%252Bmatchallpartial%26WTz_l%3DHeader%253BSearch-All%2BProducts%26WTz_st%3D%26WTz_stype%3DSP%26form_state%3DsearchForm%26search%3Dwaders%26searchTypeByFilter%3DAllProducts%26x%3D0%26y%3D0&Ntt=waders&WTz_l=Header%3BSearch-All+Products
647215,spinnerdoc,2011-12-11 02:19:00,556,"Hi fellas,  I slipped two weeks ago and landed on my knees on a rocky river bed with some steel mesh on the banks, a few minutes later cold water slowly seeped in and it was bearable at the time as it wasn't that cold. Been trying to find where the leak is but have had no success doing so. I poured water into the boot and tried sqeezing it but water was not coming out from anywhere. I have a suspicion it's from the seam between the boot and neoprene junction, it felt it was coming from there when it leaked. But close inspection does not show any tear or seam thats undone, I'm at a loss how to fix this,perhaps a new pair, the wader is still in good condition...so i'm hesitant.  Any tips and info would be much appreciated...thanks in advance  Edwin"
647245,kemper,2011-12-11 03:28:00,2232,"I got to the point with mine where they were leaking from everywhere it seemed. I'm a student, and I'm in the middle of building a new rod so several hundred for new waders simply wasn't in the budget. $5 tube of shoe goo, turned them inside out and sealed all the seams with the shoe goo. Haven't been wet since."
647274,BillM,2011-12-11 04:57:00,17367,"Fill them up completely with water, lol."
647281,Twocoda,2011-12-11 05:36:00,4130,oh thats never fun...especially when your still in them...  sho goo plumbers goo or marine goo....im told they are all the same product with different wrapping but i use the marine version...sealed many leaks over the years  to find the leak ....put them on and sit in the bathtub....then flip them inside out and inspect
647291,chefboi17,2011-12-11 06:45:00,128,"Try soapy water, fill the waders with air and cover the outside of the waders with the soapy water. When you squeeze the waders to increase the pressure any holes will form bubbles. Mark em with chalk, let the waders dry and seal them up and go fish"
647295,TDunn,2011-12-11 11:17:00,680,Best bang for your buck -  shoe goo....Ive used it a ton I have a tube of aquaseal also....much smaller tube and double the price but it does work well!  edit- Ive alway found my leaks by just looking. Ive never had to fill my waders with water...I'd just goo the whole seam like kemper did. If thats where you felt the water come in. That should seal you up nice!  TDunn
647306,solopaddler,2011-12-11 13:25:00,8605,Go in a completely dark room and shove a super bright flashlight inside your waders. You should be able to pinpoint the leak that way.
647314,woodenboater,2011-12-11 14:00:00,2277,"Similar to chefboi's idea, fill the tub up with water, get as much air into your waders as possible, cinch it tight as possible and stick it under water and squeeze. Any air bubbles should present themselves and it's how I would nail down any drysuit leaks."
647318,Ralph Field,2011-12-11 14:11:00,1018,I use Solopaddler's method and have always been able to find the leak.
647319,Billy Bob,2011-12-11 14:13:00,5865,Buy new waders.
647321,Roy,2011-12-11 14:23:00,13728, More easily accomplished with waders removed.
647423,spinnerdoc,2011-12-11 20:24:00,556,Thanks for the tips..I'm gonna try them and see if can get away with repairing them instead of buying new ones.  BillM: I filled it up and nothing...absolutely no leak anywhere. The water seem to come in but not the other way around
647424,spinnerdoc,2011-12-11 20:27:00,556,"I'll give this a shot...Thanks Mike  and to the rest of you, big thanks for take the time to help me out. I'll let you guys know how it turns out  Cheers Edwin"
647431,kickingfrog,2011-12-11 20:39:00,8333,"      Wife: ""Honey what are you doing in the closet with that flashlight and your rubber pant thingys?""  Husband: ""Oh nothing, after this I'm going to need some dish soap and a tub of water."""
647434,torco,2011-12-11 20:49:00,656,I have done the samething solo suggested it works well just make sure you mark where the leak was so when you are no longer in the dark you can still find it. I just held the waders in the spot with my fingers and aquasealed it up once i was back in the light.
647456,chefboi17,2011-12-11 22:29:00,128,"I find a bathtub works best when using the soap method, it's easy to rinse them up afterwards, and you might even get rid of the smell that most waders accumulate lol.  If any of these methods can't pinpoint the leak, try flipping them inside out and check again"
647467,kemper,2011-12-11 23:19:00,2232,There is a hairspray trick too...problem is I can't remember if you spray the outside and then turn them inside out or vice versa.
647469,spinnerdoc,2011-12-11 23:27:00,556,I think with all these tips I should be able to pin point and seal the leak...   Btw..where can you get shoe goo? Sorry guys I've never come across this product. Thanks in advance
647470,spinnerdoc,2011-12-11 23:27:00,556,LOL

648076,spinnerdoc,2011-12-13 21:39:00,556,Thanks Chris
648524,spinnerdoc,2011-12-15 03:29:00,556,Finally found the leak....It's a puncture at the tip of the booth right by the big toe  .... Hopefully this is the only one...ended up plugging it with my tire repair kit and then sealing it with shoe goo on top..  Thanks again guys...hopefully this works
648569,Billy Bob,2011-12-15 11:07:00,5865, WTH...that's not a leak....that's a BLOW OUT.....  Good Luck with the repair....but if I were you I would start saving for a new pair.  Bob
648810,bassnass,2011-12-16 02:01:00,174,For your next pair - FORGET neoprene - look into a good breathable pr - Wright & McGill - AWESOME and reasonable $!
648848,spinnerdoc,2011-12-16 03:53:00,556,"Thanks I'll keep that in mind. I was actually happy with the neoprene and how durable it was, had this one for quite sometime, it is a bit hot on mild days thats the thing, but we'll see and like I said I'll keep it in mind"
