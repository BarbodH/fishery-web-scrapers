599944,limeyangler,2011-07-06 16:12:00,5204,"Hi all,  Went to a small local lake and got into some nice walleye. I Thought the bite was panning out to be an evening bite but found some active walleye in the weeds by accident while messing around with the pike.  A the wind dropped and the sun began to set the walleyes in the weeds dissappeared and i moved out deeper(11') and used a slip bobber as the fishfinder was showing the fish being very shy of biting. The calm conditions really lent themselves to this presentation and the walleye were far more willing to bite.  A good 2 hours of relaxation after an afternoon of ripping drywall down in my washroom.   <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/tio6gJyenu4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   NICE CHUNKY WALLEYES      FOUND THE DAY WALKERS BY ACCIDENT WITH THIS CONTRAPTION      SLIP BOBBERS AT SUNDOWN.........NICE!

599963,Leecher,2011-07-06 16:44:00,7832,"Great way to spend a couple of hours Simon Yesterday, went for an afternoon of wally hunting with Paul and caught a couple of saugers on jig and twister tail tipped with a dewie... when the bite died down, targetted largies in the shallows..... 3 hours of none stop action until sun set  Jitter bug and skitter pop was the lures of choice.... even got 4 nice bass in 4 casts   Total tally for the evening was over 50 largies boated between the two of us  Thanks for sharing Jacques  Edited to say:  Mepps Black Furry is a very versatile lure.... It catches fish period   of different species"
599968,limeyangler,2011-07-06 16:56:00,5204,  Now that sounds like fun...where are the PICTURES!!!!!?????
599972,Leecher,2011-07-06 17:02:00,7832, It sure was a lot of fun to watch our lures get violently strike on surface     Unfortunately the camera was not used   didn't want to cut on my fishing time  Next time I'll try to get a few videos of the action... it was INCREDIBLE to say the least
600022,Rob,2011-07-06 19:10:00,467,"Nice work Simon, gotta to love slip bobber fishing when the lake is like glass!  Rob C"
600050,Nipfisher,2011-07-06 20:34:00,2449,Yep pretty tough to complain when you have non-stop walleye action within minutes of your house. Great video and pics simon. You are gonna have to find a better place to put your hand held remote so we can hear you better. Almost sounds like you have an english accent?
600400,ohhenrygsr,2011-07-07 23:31:00,947,When ever i'm feeling down I will always watch this video Thank you 
649308,BulBob,2011-12-18 12:21:00,6,Slip Rigging a Bullet Bobber is the best way to fish. Bullet Bobbers plane to the side and flip direction when you give them a little tug. Use a split shot to set the minimum depth and a bobber stop if you want to limit the maximum depth. When you give it slack it drops and moves sideways and not directly towards you. Great for getting into tight places without worry of snagging on the cast. www.bulletbobber.com 
649326,Rizzo,2011-12-18 13:50:00,4754,hmmm wonder if bulbob has any interest in bullet bobber sales
649383,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-18 18:15:00,2582,I think your onto something there Rizzo 
649394,icefisherman,2011-12-18 20:04:00,952,"Simon I knew it will not take long to see you with some eyes at the end of your line But I do think you need a good camera man...if I was there I would have got you one of the action shots right when the bobber goes down...priceless  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
