649158,Rizzo,2011-12-17 16:46:00,4754,"My wife was running some errands today, so I gave her my owners manual and asked her to pick up some oil for the crank case of my 50 hp 4 stroke Johnson, as I plan on changing the oil myself today (in the past have had the pros do it). It needs 2.2 litres. Wife just called me and said at Cdn tire the equivalent motor oil Sae 10 W 40 with a couple more letters tacked on (ie not ""johnson"" or evinrude) only comes in 946 ml containers and its over $20 a bottle (I think she said it has a motorcycle on the bottle). Need 3 bottles, with tax this will be over $70. I never paid attention to how much the oil was when the pros did it but does this sound correct? i kind of figured I'd be getting one of those 1 gallon jugs for twentysomething bucks"
649161,cwpowell,2011-12-17 16:49:00,265,Sounds like she might be looking at AMSoil?
649162,irishfield,2011-12-17 16:50:00,26272,"Roger.. tell her to get out of the motorcycle isle!!! You don't want 4 stroke bike oil in your outboard. The stuff has gear box additive in it and you don't want that in our engine.  Normal auto 10W40 is probably all you need for the 50HP at $4 a quart, when she turns around to face the far store wall.. That's all the marina puts in most outboards until they get higher up in horsepower."
649169,Rizzo,2011-12-17 17:08:00,4754,"ok so she just got back and it is synthetic motorcycle oil 10w40 - also says amsoil on it. Are you saying don't use this stuff, would be better with just 10 W 40?"
649172,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-17 17:25:00,10439,"Get yourself some Mobil 1 10W40 full synthetic oil about $11 a liter. It is so superior to regular $4 liter dino oil that the extra $$$$ are well worth the cost. I put that stuff in everything!!!!!  I became a believer in synthetics when I switched from regular with my 2004 Honda Civic. It was my third in 12 years (leases) and I noticed with the first 2 when I hit about 70,000km I got some valve train noise on cold start up. With my 2004 vehicle I immediately went with Mobil1 and the noise that showed in the first two civics never showed on the newest one even when it had 250,000kms on it.  Even my 2 strokes get synthetic oils now as well as the other fluids on my 2005 Honda Pilot. Synthetic power steering fluid makes a big difference here in the iquid nitrogen cold of winter North of 60*."
649180,fishdawg,2011-12-17 18:11:00,912,"roger, i run 10-40 synthetic in my 30hp Johnson 4stroke, 8 years in now, no issues"
649183,aplumma,2011-12-17 18:19:00,6896,4 stroke approved oils and tests.  Hope this helps  Art
649219,scugpg,2011-12-17 22:05:00,1373,You should run a marine rated oil Rizzo.
649227,Rizzo,2011-12-17 22:36:00,4754,"well been away from the computer a few hours now. Long story short...I'm going to return the $71 of motorcycle oil. Went to the store and grabbed some 10W40...then found out I didn't have a metric allen key...back to store for allen key. Changed out the oil and winterized the boat. Now I have all winter to decide if the 10W40 I put in there is good enough, or if I want to change it again in the spring. Thank you for all the input!"
649485,Billy Bob,2011-12-19 10:31:00,5865,"Synthetic oil does has it's advantages but ""sometimes"" can cause oil leaks. I put in Mobil 1 in my back up generator and it sprung a leak....Sears repaired it under warranty and you guessed it, another leak now that it's not under warranty...  ....however my Tundra has been running on Mobil 1 since it's first oil change without problems.  BTW Walmart's full synthetic oil is Mobil 1 for a about $7 less per 5 qt jug."
649517,FishAbout,2011-12-19 15:55:00,106,"I use 10w30 merc oil in my 140hp suzuki. Johnson four strokes are suzuki's.  Merc uses 10w30 in most of there outboards untill you get into the Verado's.  I work at a marina so I get the oil next to nothing, Have not had a problem with the motor and put about 150hrs a year on it."
649679,Rizzo,2011-12-20 00:51:00,4754,mine says Bombardier
649689,FishAbout,2011-12-20 01:30:00,106,Bombardier 4 strokes were suzuki's. Just different colour and stickers  Johnsons are no longer made.
649695,Fisherman,2011-12-20 01:53:00,7201,"Nice find Art.  Now if someone could find who actually makes or re labels the generic containers of oil for all the different companies.  We all know that Merc, etc, don't have their own oil derricks and pump their own crude to be refined."
649696,Rizzo,2011-12-20 01:55:00,4754, got it
