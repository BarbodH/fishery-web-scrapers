647179,adempsey,2011-12-11 01:07:00,1498,"Nakina might be a bit far for a 3 nighter?  Worth it IMO, but that means 2 extra days vacation.  As for a boat-to lodge, I am not sure they accommodate weekends?? Maybe.  If so, Ellen Island would be a great choice (assuming they have the accommodations for 12+ people - it's a small resort).  They haul all your gear in for you so it's not a big deal at all.  However, you are stuck on the island for the duration.  For the most part it looks like you've been to the places I would recommend.  Which Kawartha Lakes have you tried?  I like fishing Pigeon Lake and Jack Lake.  Plenty of cottage resorts on Pigeon and one on Jack.  Did you stay on the Upper or Lower French?  Next year I hope to stay at Flat Rapids Camp for a weekend.  It's on the Lower French.  You could try Georgian Bay in the 30,000 Islands region.  It's busy in the summer, but should be nice in May/early June.  Somewhere like Pleasant Cove  or Kenlea Cottages.  Pleasant Cove is nice, but more of a family resort.  Kenlea is more of a fishing resort.  Maybe somehwere near Parry Sound like Mill Lake Cottages.  There's a nice place on the Montreal River I wanted to try as well called White Pine Lodge.  It's a boat to, but it's a 2 minute boat ride from the pick up point at Mowats Landing (where you get picked up for the Lady Ev fishing lodges).  Good luck!"
647195,stasbrute,2011-12-11 01:32:00,206,"Try Kenlea Camp outta Point au Baril, great pike and walleye in early may, I go there spring and fall and always do well."
647259,Cast-Away,2011-12-11 03:44:00,790,"Dave, I did not mention that my buddy and I always camp and there are a ton of great large group campsites at the Massasauga if you can round up enough boats. I can give you a list of a few of these sites if this is an option?"
647370,fishfearus,2011-12-11 17:17:00,4,"We always go to lake nipissing that time of year. Walleye are close to shore no need to go out in the big lake that time of year. We stay at Sandy bay cottages been going for approx. 15 years, the cottage we stay in have about 8 beds I think."
647373,Rodwrap,2011-12-11 17:34:00,130,"  I have the same problem, 10-16 people who want their own bed. It's hard to find places ... we use Redwingcottages.com  on Chemong."
647436,the spirit of fishing,2011-12-11 20:59:00,141,"I've been going to this Camp for the last 10 years, pretty close to your drive time through Sudbury and visitors from Quebec can come in from the East. http://www.duenorth.net/shiningtreecamp/fishing.html Derek and Cathy are great hosts and you can count on them helping you out. I'll be there 26 May 2012 for a week with our regular crew and if you were there at the same time I would also be happy to help you with advice. The home Lake has Walleye,Pike,Bass(open year round) and Whitefish, all of which we've caught while sitting on shore at the Camp having a cold one , so for the less ambitious fishermen they can relax. There are also countless other lakes nearby for the same species as well as Lake,Speckle,Splake or Rainbow trout. Boats/motors for a crew your size shouldn't be a problem and they can provide boats/motor/trailers to venture to different waters. In case you needed it there is an LCBO outlet about 5 minutes away. They have the beds to accommodate your group,availability may be an issue. You can PM me if you need more info or give Derek a call they're open year round."
647541,dave1965,2011-12-12 04:06:00,41," Hello Rodrap,  I checked out this place on the net. How long have you been going to Chemong? We,ve been to Sturgeon Lake many times and found it really good for walleye ( but there's very few if any Pike."
647545,dave1965,2011-12-12 04:19:00,41, Thanks so much Spirit. This place sounds really good and I sent them an e-mail. Did you really say that Bass is open year round?  Dave
647549,the spirit of fishing,2011-12-12 04:27:00,141,"Yes Bass is open year round here. The boundary between fishing zones is Highway 560; north of 560 open,south of 560 closed;Shining Tree and the lake is on the north side of the highway."
648230,dave1965,2011-12-14 05:57:00,41," Hey Spirit,  After following through with the many leads in this post, your place , so far, has raised the most interest. However, there are very few pics on their site. Could you send me some pics if you have them? How are their cabins and boats?  Dave"

649510,kuhaman,2011-12-19 15:07:00,503,Deschennes lake is south  of the 560 and bass is open year round

646703,dave1965,2011-12-09 04:18:00,41,"Ok all you fishing experts.  I'm looking for a place to book our annual fishing get together. We're a group of 12 to 15 friends that have got together for fishing every late May, early June for the past 8 years.Places we`ve gone to include: The French River,Temagami, Kawarthas, and Land o`Lakes. While i usually love surfing the net looking at all the amazing places, I thought that the folks at OFC could advise some awesome places.  Aside from good fishing,of course, we are looking for cottages that could sleep each guy in seperate beds with a minimum of 6 boats with motors,for 3 nights. We`re also hoping to keep it less than 5 hours from Toronto.  So any lead would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance,sincerely,  `DR`Dave"
646772,Rizzo,2011-12-09 15:00:00,4754,"I haven't seen their cottages, but Lakair Lodge up on the West arm of Nipissing has always been good to OFC'ers"
646776,GBW,2011-12-09 15:05:00,8460,did you get the OFC newletter?  Here's one from the past. http://www.ontariofishinglakes.com/olivelake.html
646779,jimmer,2011-12-09 15:08:00,2730,"Take advantage of your 5 hour limit and go as far north as you can. I wish I had a place to recommend, but judging from previous post, it gets better as you go further north. Obviously you're going after walleye and pike and the best walleye stories I hear about come from the north. (with the exception of Quinte at times)"
646789,GBW,2011-12-09 15:17:00,8460,"I would google ""Cronzy's Favourite Fishing Holes"" cause you know he likes a good shore lunch so there must be fish there."
646819,esoxcrazy,2011-12-09 16:33:00,22,"There are a few sections of the French, why not try em all!  Easy drive to location, are you looking for housekeeping cottage or do you want your meals included?  I have been fishing the French for years and the first few weeks of walleye are usually incredible.  For a 5 hour radius There is no need to go further north.  Unless you want to drive another 3-5 hours."
646988,dave1965,2011-12-10 03:32:00,41," Whoa!!!! This is unbelievably awesome!!! I wrote this post before I went to bed last night and already received a multitude of truly great leads! I'm going to be all over the place but please bear with me.  1) Yes, we have been doing the housekeeping thing since we have some great chefs who enjoys making gourmet meals after the fishing!  2) Jimmer, you're right, Walleye and Pike is our thing and although last year Sturgeon Lake (in the Kawarthas) was excellent and Elephant Lake the year before, I have been playimg with the idea of going further North for great Walleye!The furthest North being Temagami.  3)FYI we call our friendly tournament the Annual RASS Fishing Classic - RASS an acronym for "" Real Angling Super Stars"" which is really funny since only half of the guys could be considered really good fishermen while the rest of us do as much socializing as fishing. We're even attracting some young guns in their early 20s to accompany us old older ""farts"" in our fourties -incidentally these young guns have been kicking our _sses in the past few years! We do have some friends from Quebec ( Montreal)  so some yeras we tried to make it a little closer for them.  Anyways I will begin my task to responding to the responses I have been receiving and I'm so, so grateful for all yer suggestions and looking forward to more!  Sincerely,  ""DR"" Dave"
646990,GBW,2011-12-10 03:37:00,8460, Sinclair says (from GBW's computer):  Drive north for 4h59min then turn right.

647004,Nipfisher,2011-12-10 04:20:00,2449,"How about Lake Nosbonsing or Talon Lake in North Bay? Both should have what you are looking for. Lake Nipissing has about 100 of the resorts you seek from West arm, to Callander Bay, to South Shore. Fishing is good but you have to work. However the dates you mentioned in your OP are perfect for Nipissing."
647005,dave1965,2011-12-10 04:25:00,41,"  We never tried Lake Nipissing as we've preferred smaller lakes for safety reasons. But I'll take a look at Lake Nosbonsing, Talon Lake, and Callander Bay.  Thanks a bunch,  Dave"

647027,SmokestackLightnin,2011-12-10 13:28:00,390,"http://www.wrightpointresort.com/  Lots of water to choose from, boats and motors are all in good shape. Within your time restriction and lots of crown land so not very much boat traffic."
647032,solopaddler,2011-12-10 13:58:00,8605,12-15 friends that each require a separate bedroom? That almost certainly would require multiple cottages.  As far as a recommendation I can give you all kinds within 5 hours of the GTA. Each and every one will have marginal fishing.  If you go once a year just drive to Nakina and be done with it. You'll catch stupid numbers of fish.  PM me if you're willing to drive 13 hours.
647049,gordy28,2011-12-10 15:33:00,638,"Slightly outside of your 5 hours but we enjoyed Ellen Island Camp on Laduy Evelyn-housekeeping, multiple cottages and boats. Lady E is great fishing but the one thing I would recommend is to do lots of research on this site for spots, tips, baits etc as we didn't find the lodge owner or the dock guys knowledgable at all about the fishing (if not for a few friendly folks in the camp at the same time we would have really struggled) www.ellenislandcamp.com"
647078,dave1965,2011-12-10 18:16:00,41," Hey Gordy,  I was just checking out Ellen Island Camp last night. While it looks incredible and I've heard that Lady Evelyn Lake is awesome for Walleye ( I saw a Cronzy show at Lady Evelyn Lake), it would be a bit of a pain for us to wait for a ferry ride back and forth for us to the island epecially with all the food and booze we tend to run out of frequently.  Thanks,  DR. Dave"
647080,Cast-Away,2011-12-10 18:26:00,790,You can also try a couple of places at the Moon River where it drains into Georgian Bay. This is only two hours from the city and has plenty of Bass and Pike with the odd Walleye. Google it because there is Moon River Cottages and at least one other place there. My buddy and i have been fishing there for over 20 years in July and have a blast.
647081,dave1965,2011-12-10 18:35:00,41," Oh no solo paddler, not seperate bed rooms, but individual beds- even bunk beds would be fine, in fact preferable since it usualy costs less. In fact we've rented 4 cottages before and each year our numbers are growing.  The most efficient packages for us have been the ""Spring Fishing Specials"" which combine the cottages and boats for 3 nights like we enjoyed at Elephant Lake and Net Lake.  I'll e-mail the guys and see what they think about driving further out. I'm sure if it means lots of monster fish, it would be easy to convince since weve had some trips with the most beautiful cottages, really nice boats, great weather and only 4 hours away, but the fishing was really tough!( we were at Big Gull Lake that year). No doubt the guys would have traded that in for a far away,1 star cottage but with awesome fishing, in a heart beat!  Dr. Dave"
647084,dave1965,2011-12-10 18:39:00,41," Great suggestion! A few of us fished the Moon River last year and we landed some huge Bass and Pike. For our little ""tourney"" I never found too many cottagse rentals there but I'll cerainly check again.  Thanks,  Dr. Dave"
647087,dave1965,2011-12-10 18:55:00,41," I jsut e-mailed Olive Lake,  Thanks,  DR. Dave"
647092,Tom McCutcheon,2011-12-10 19:29:00,627,"I would check out rivers and lakes where the primary species is Pike, Walleye or Trout. In late May or early June there are not many places within that 4 to 5 hour drive that seasons are open for bass also."
647101,Rod Caster,2011-12-10 20:40:00,5784," I canoed on Olive Lake this summer, the two north arms, and caught a few nice pike and bass. It's a really nice area and you have close access to TONS of lakes."
647150,gordy28,2011-12-11 00:01:00,638,"True although you can pre order your beer through the lodge-just over order, and it would probably only be 2 ferry ride in.  When we were there 11 of us (4 different groups) went in at the same time Anyway-good luck with your search!"
647158,Scott S,2011-12-11 00:26:00,203,Check out Tama Kwa Resort. I've been going there for years. If the lake is calm you fish the big water. If the lake is rough your close to Callander Bay and fish the islands. Scooter
