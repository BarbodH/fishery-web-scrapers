649623,NAW,2011-12-19 22:20:00,4022,I think there's a Bravo in one of those pics  It always a pleasure to see your pictures Moosebunk.
649647,esoxansteel,2011-12-19 23:22:00,1307,"Amazing pictures Drew, and shows the extreme tranquility of that area, breath taking, but that is the positive side of that area, their is another side that isnt so pretty, which is the neglect weve had over our own people, pumping billions of dollars to foreign countries while our own people suffer, living in tents with no running water, or bathrooms, when you go on a vacation to Mexico, you most likely will only see Mexico the good, not to many guided tours to Tijuana I would suspect. When you live in an area that is so beautiful, seeing mans destruction, do they really want us their? maybe the reason for the silence."
649729,nofish4me,2011-12-20 03:17:00,404," I explained to DanC where I was coming from, by PM. As usual (with me) it was a long way to try and connect the dots. Hahaha"
650094,gatorchaser,2011-12-21 14:30:00,5,"Amazing pics, brand new to this forum and looking forward to reading more and hearing more great fishing experiences. I have really enjoyed reading about the trips to Pym Island and the detailed reports. My group have booked a trip into Pym island for this July and would love any tips or advice on making this our best trip ever. Lure selections, what is a must to bring as far as food ,clothes or any other helpful hints."
650098,lew,2011-12-21 14:39:00,12766, Welcome to the board gatorchaser.  You'd probably do better with your request by starting a new post on your destination and hopefully someone will have the info your looking for.
650113,gatorchaser,2011-12-21 15:55:00,5,  Thankyou lew! I will try that route.
650121,Headhunter,2011-12-21 16:12:00,5703," There is a lot more going on up there than what we read/hear on TV... it seems to me that it's pretty easy to dump on both sides,  (gov and natives) based on what we hear see on the media... some where in the middle, will lie the truth. HH"
650146,Oggie,2011-12-21 17:51:00,588,And they wonder why the First Nations don't want to RELOCATE!  Think your pics said it all! Dan O.
650156,Moosebunk,2011-12-21 18:35:00,3970," Hey... favorite response of the day.  My wife, friends and family wondered why I didn't want to relocate too."
650184,muskymatt,2011-12-21 21:32:00,2608,Unfreeking believable   :worthy:  The one sunset pic with the purple in it is probably the best I've EVER seen...simply amazing dude!!  
649197,Moosebunk,2011-12-17 20:32:00,3970,"When times came to speak there was often plenty to be said, but when looking around, there were few to none who would listen.   A glimpse into the Attawapiskat and James Bay.  Where here, there's nothing to be found except peace of mind.                                                             "

649201,nofish4me,2011-12-17 20:38:00,404,"Been there, done that, got pictures. Where the hell is DanC today? Hahaha As stated, after I posted, great pictures. If a picture is worth a 1000 words, I understand why you posted pictures instead of text (always look forward to reading your posts)."

649348,Tom McCutcheon,2011-12-18 15:36:00,627,The one photo of the pool from below the waterfall is so clear I believe I saw some Specks in it.
649360,Moosebunk,2011-12-18 16:29:00,3970," On that day I think did too...  In the spring that spot was part of a little milk-run and now and again if getting there first after a good fresh tide, the odd searun speck or two could be waiting...     Thanks gang.  Looking over old pics is something done often enough.  They are ""happy"" places and good memories to be relived."
