Yamaha is going to stop making the Bravo.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2011/12/17/north-inuit-yamaha-bravo.html  I had one given to me 5 years ago.  I didn't realize what I had been given untill people started complimenting me in my rig.  A little research, and I realized that I had been given Yamaha's best selling snowmobile in the history of the company.  1981, to 2012.  30 years.. That's a good run.  And with little to no changes in the past 25 years.  Mine's an 89.   Maybe it will be worth more now that it's discontinued.  If you've got any Bravo pics, post them up.  I'd love to see them!    "
649616,misfish,2011-12-19 21:29:00,29133,So how much you want for it now thats a collectable? LOL   I miss my yammy exciter.
649617,kuhaman,2011-12-19 21:37:00,503,"Love the 250 bravo, a friend of mine has 2 and they are great. I have a couple of 125 sno sports for the kids and they just keep goin and goin. Would love to have a VK540 for breakin trails."
649628,ecmilley,2011-12-19 22:34:00,2163,"they were good little work horses that would go just about anywhere, wonder what they will replace it with? maybe a stretched phazer or something"
649631,NAW,2011-12-19 22:42:00,4022," Who nows eh.  I can tell you one thing though, It will cost a heck of a lot more"
649633,Freshtrax,2011-12-19 22:55:00,2215,I got a hand me down 84 bravo when i was 12 i used to jump it ditch bang and that thing kept coming back for more.
649640,Rod Caster,2011-12-19 23:10:00,5784,"  You bet it will.  My brother has one that is completely beat up. It even survived 3 years in Kujuurapik, Quebec. He is mechanically deficient and still it starts every year within the first few pulls.  If I were in the market, I'd be looking for a Bravo, it's the perfect reliable bushwacker... I'll have to look for used ones now."
649645,Tybo,2011-12-19 23:17:00,1373,Out of all Use sled heads here. Who has never rode a Bravo.
649648,Cast-Away,2011-12-19 23:27:00,790,It is the stereo theory.  VOLUME!!!!!!
649650,kuhaman,2011-12-19 23:32:00,503,"Nah, it's the best bang for the buck theory."
649654,NAW,2011-12-19 23:42:00,4022," I was thinking the same thing.  Honestly,  There's not to many outdoorsman over 30, who have never riden a Bravo.  They're a quiet sled too.  Atleast mine is.  They have a very unique sound.  A weak sound, but still unique"
