I was able to get out last week,Things started off a little slow i started to think that it may be to cold for spinners,but then i came up to a nice deep slow run first two casts yielded two fish, the first fish was a feisty male that gave me some aerial acrobats to watch.  The second fish was a big female that peeled the line off the drag and nearly spooled me because i have very little line on my spool left,so i had to go for a bit of a walk got her in and i think it may be my pb of the season  We then switched to a section down river and i got a little brown haven't got one of those since sept  Well it was starting to get late and i had worked this pool for a while with no results but then after switching to a #3 silver mepps from #2 gold i had a taker a nice male  The rest of the fish go back to Nov and late Oct.This one was spot fished in clear water cast about five ft ahead of it don't know how it didn't see me i was only a few ft beside it,but love watching them hit.You have to excuse some of these pics not best quality and some weird faces but that's the way it is LoL   a wee coho  another wee one       "
