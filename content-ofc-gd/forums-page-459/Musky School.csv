647845,cowanjo,2011-12-13 02:14:00,249,"Ok So I am thinking of taking my boat and gear and heading to the school,i went to wisconsin last year it was unbelievable but lake of the woods is the holy grail have a mate from Australia who wants to partner (for those who met brownie and fished with him this year he may well come and just fly and pay the camp anyway with a guide) and a couple of non fisherman mates wanting to go but am concerned with the what ifs - please see http://www.muskyhunter.com/university-of-esox/ for information  So If your willing to pay for the school and do some driving infact most! as i drive like mr magoo in my subaru I am going so im picking up all the rest of the getting there and back costs could be a trip of the lifetime. Some of the guys here will tell you i am australian and am a mad fisherman, so we will be going hard if we go. I will be leaving from Toronto (Kawartha Lakes)  Ok so what are the people thoughts here of lake of the woods"
647854,Rizzo,2011-12-13 02:24:00,4754,awesome! Good for you that would be an unbelievable experience.
647862,bigbuck,2011-12-13 03:05:00,2449,It is an incredible body of water. I've fished a small part of it and its worth it if you have the chance. I'd go back up in a heartbeat.
647865,mike rousseau,2011-12-13 03:14:00,4661,i wish i knew what my situation would be then...  trip of a lifetime for sure....  ive thought about doing the school for a couple years now...  and i love driving on road trips...  some day...   have fun
648788,bassnass,2011-12-16 00:53:00,174,That sounds amazing....and I can drive AND fish like a maniac!  Hmm...
648795,muskymatt,2011-12-16 01:14:00,2608,check out my blog..  http://muskymattottawariver.blogspot.com/  Awesome time!!!!!
648859,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-12-16 04:48:00,535,"That would be an awesome experience, I'm sure somebody here will take you up on your offer.  I'd love to do it in the future but the problem is it's hard enough finding someone who wants to fish musky for a day, let alone an entire week. None of my fishing buddies share my stamina/stubborness and I don't know anyone who'd take an entire week off just to musky fish."
648889,I'mHooked,2011-12-16 14:07:00,525,"Awe, you're just teasing aren't you!"
648892,bigbuck,2011-12-16 14:21:00,2449,"Let's see, 4am departure, 8am brekkie outside of Sudbury, 2pm lunch in White River or Wawa, Dinner in Thunder Bay around 6ish and arrival sometime after midnight. I've done the route to Kenora a few times so I know the drill and can recommend where to stop. I'd be in but I can't commit to something that far out. Keep us all posted."
649070,cowanjo,2011-12-17 02:15:00,249,Mate they are going to get your place in my boat in the fall....at my cottage!!! Had a few interested parties. sort of a one week deal not sure can make them catch three musky first day out later!
649319,Handlebarz,2011-12-18 13:20:00,3790,Dang John that sounds amazing I hope some one can take you up on the trip I cant as we have a weeks vacation the week after I would be getting back.  For anyone who has not met John or Brownie I must tell you they are awesome guys I had the pleasure of meeting them this summer and would love to have them both back here next year take the chance if you can afford it and get the time off. LOTW is a amazing fishery and this will be a great time of year to hit it the blackfiles should be all done skitters not as bad and the fish on fire.
