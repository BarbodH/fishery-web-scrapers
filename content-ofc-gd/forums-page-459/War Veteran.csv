649728,Meely,2011-12-20 03:12:00,282,"I was wondering how I can go about finding more info on a war veteran. I happened across an old service document dating back to 1916 indicating a George Haley had enlisted on February 6, 1916. He was part of the 166th battalion of the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. I tried contacting the QOR but I haven thad any response yet. Tried Googling but ZIP!!  Anybody have any ideas?  Thanks,  Meely"

649747,kickingfrog,2011-12-20 03:59:00,8333,I'm doing the same thing. This weekend I was looking at a plaque for WWII vets KIA and saw my name. It was a little surreal. As far as I know I have no relations from the area.
649748,Skipper D,2011-12-20 04:01:00,1970,Maybe try to find a good war buff online .
649760,bigugli,2011-12-20 05:19:00,6138,"If the military document has the person's service number, Veteran's Affairs can look up his MSR. More detailed info might be available through the regimental archives. Be patient. THe QOR is a militia regt. No one is going to be there daily to answer e-mails, especially at Christmas."
649800,fishing n autograph,2011-12-20 13:48:00,2540,"Go to the national archives in canada and do a search on his name. You'll find his enlistment papers and where he was killed in action. I have discovered 16 distant relatives that enlisted in ww1 that I didn't know about. 1 was KIA in France and I have his burial plot and cemetary info. As well, the government sent me some info as well along with a certified copy of the page of the book of rememberance where his name appears"
