But they took it with them when they moved  I've been trying to find a free barrel, but the best I could find was $50 from Barrie Metals.  This weekend, Brian hooked me up with a free one!!  And my timing was perfect too.  When I went to pick it up, Brian had just finished cooking dinner, and offered me some.  Man, that was some of the best tasting seafood linguine I've ever had.   Lobster, Shrimp, Alfredo sauce...Mouth watering!!  Thanks again Brian!  "

Ron"
649461,Leecher,2011-12-19 02:35:00,7832,Good on Brian for getting you one Nick Don't leave that beer so close to the fire next time Leechman
649469,NAW,2011-12-19 03:49:00,4022," Thanks Ron, I assumed cuz I'm in the country, that I can do what ever i want.  I'll read up on the bi-laws.    They don't last long enough to get warm!"
649475,Leecher,2011-12-19 04:23:00,7832, Right on Nick
649489,misfish,2011-12-19 11:54:00,29133," Ya should of dropped in yesterday aswell.It was jigs dinner night.  No worries.If ya need another Nick, I got one here.   Aint that the truth.LMAO"
649526,Beans,2011-12-19 16:16:00,3339,In our area we have to have a permit (free) to burn stuff and must let the township know when we start and finish...  During the nice months (April 01 to Oct 31) we cannot burn between 08:00AM to 06:00PM...
649547,NAW,2011-12-19 17:53:00,4022,"I just got off the phone with the local fire department.  I do need a permit, and it is free.  Thanks for the reminder guys!  In my area, I'm allowed to have ""recreational fires"" as long as my pit is 2' x 2' or smaller, and I burn clean wood, or nothing that will make excessive smoke.  Good to know."
649548,Skipper D,2011-12-19 18:05:00,1970,"What happens some times is passer bys see a flame then right away calls 911 , a few have been fined in the past this way in spring water for no permit when they show up . Yer safe now . Want to make the burning barrel last longer , try to keep some sort of a lid on it , to keep the weather out when its not in use ................... Happy burning ."
649560,NAW,2011-12-19 19:26:00,4022," Thanks Ron, that's a great idea  Would also be good for snuffing the fire out if need be.  Also a note for other Springwater dwellers..  The new fire permits for 2012 are available now.."
649581,tb4me,2011-12-19 20:22:00,3295,"We used a burn barrel for many years..If you want to make it last longer and burn faster do the following..Get 2 pcs of 3x3 angle iron slightly longer then the barrel is wide. Set the angle iron on the ground so that the pointed end is up. Then take a pick axe and punch about 10 , 1 inch holes in the barrel on the side at the bottom all the way around. Then set the barrel on the angle iron. Water can drain out and when you burn the air can get under the barrel and things burn much hotter and quicker. Our barrels would last for many years this way..Also yes a lid is recommended too. If none available we just used a piece of plywood. We would never burn our barrel until it was almost full..This was long before recycling was available so everything that could burn went into it..Kind of nasty when I think about what got burnt.. Happy barrel bashing, many a good beer will go down there..."
649596,NAW,2011-12-19 21:01:00,4022,I was thinking about holes in the bottom.  Let some air in.  What about holes in the side..?  will it let a little more heat out?  It will keep the smokers warm at my new years eve / house warming party!
649600,tb4me,2011-12-19 21:03:00,3295,"For some reason we always did the side, but right along the bottom..I dont know why we didnt do the bottom, but to find out id have to ask my Grandfather, unfortubately he passed 7 years ago.."
