649858,fishnsled,2011-12-20 18:37:00,3520,"A Christmas Story would have to be my favourite as well but also enjoy the these, It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, A Christmas Carol with Alistair Sims and of course National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Haven't seen The Polar Express, will have to try and watch that this year.   They also came out with the top 10 worst Christmas movie list today. I think I'd like to see the number one pick.   1. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians 2. Silent Night, Deadly Night 3. Jingle All the Way 4. Jack Frost 5. Santa with Muscles 6. Ernest Saves Christmas 7. Home Alone 3 8. Deck the Halls 9. Surviving Christmas 10. Christmas with the Kranks"

649864,Roy,2011-12-20 18:56:00,13728,"Speaking of ""A Christmas Story"", the film was shot in Cleveland, Toronto, Lindsay and St Catharines.  The Ontario portions were at the Central Senior Public School in Lindsay, Cherry Street bridge in Toronto, some parts of St Catharines including the Victoria School in St Catharines."
649867,BillM,2011-12-20 19:04:00,17367,"My vote for best Xmas movie!    Roy, my mom went to the school that part of that movie was filmed at, it's actually on Niagara Street, just south of the QEW."
649868,Headhunter,2011-12-20 19:06:00,5703,"Roy, the part in the flick where they are buying the Xmas tree, was filmed at the bottom of my mother in law's street. Queen and Elmer Ave, in the Beach. You can see the older style street car going by in the background as the father is haggling with the sales man. We love that flick... and getting myself one of their ""special awards"" has been a goal of mine for quite some time. I NEED to have one of those leg lamps in my window at Xmas... hoping my wife found one for me this year! LOL HH"
649874,Roy,2011-12-20 19:26:00,13728,Yes Joe I had recognized the Queen streetcar. I hung around the beaches for a long time and at one time lived at 2 Victoria Park...near the waterworks.
649877,Headhunter,2011-12-20 19:29:00,5703,"Small world! Wife and I lived in the apartments next to the water works for about a year, before we got married! HH"
649880,fishnsled,2011-12-20 19:37:00,3520," I wish I knew Joe, was in a store full of those leg lamps this summer. Different sizes as well! I wanted to get one but was told no, should have got it any ways."
649882,GBW,2011-12-20 19:45:00,8460,you mean this one Joe?  
649885,Headhunter,2011-12-20 19:52:00,5703,"That's the one.... it just reeks class and sophistication! And, given that it's probably made in Italy (says ""fragile"" on the box), you know it will be the envy of all my neighbours... Will, if you ever see one again, but it for me...! HH"
649886,fishnsled,2011-12-20 19:52:00,3520,Check this out Joe!!  Leg Lamps and More!!  And a road trip with the kids Joe!  Road Trip for Ralphie
649889,Headhunter,2011-12-20 19:57:00,5703,Put the card away until after Xmas Joe.... must resist... but it's alluring glow has my hands all sweaty..... dam you FnS!!!!! HH

649585,kickingfrog,2011-12-19 20:30:00,8333,"A Christmas Carol with Alastair Sim is my families' tradition on Christmas Eve.  National lampons is always good for a laugh.  This is the first year our son is aware of tv programs and so far Frosty the Snowman gets his vote, although he likes the book How the Grinch Stole Christmas best for bedtime stories."
649588,woodenboater,2011-12-19 20:39:00,2277,"ELF ! great cast (Farrell, Caan, Newhart, Deschanel...)  original Miracle on 34th Street, b/w version only"
649594,bigugli,2011-12-19 20:58:00,6138,"A Christmas Carol with Alistair Sims has always been my favourite. A close second, though hard to find, and rarely played is the original Babes in Toyland. An old black & white featuring Laurel and Hardy."
649627,Familyfisherman,2011-12-19 22:32:00,188,Christmas vacation is way out in front...Elf is a distant second....for comedy.  It's a Wonderful Life is still the all time best Christmas Movie in my mind though...

I usually try and feed the DVD player a copy of Bad Santa and Trailer Park Boys Christmas for a couple laughs as well.  My old man still watches a VHS copy of White Christmas, EVERY Christmas eve."
649772,solopaddler,2011-12-20 10:30:00,8605,Miracle On 34th St. is a yearly tradition.  For the last few years we've watched The Polar Express with the kids. Surprised no one's mentioned it. Animated or not it's a great movie.

I loved Ovaltine and just like Ralphie, I received a BB gun for Christmas in 1955 and never shot my eye out like Mom said I would.  Everytime I see that movie it reminds me of me and my little brother back in the day.  My family knows how much I enjoy that show and my daughter even put this in my stocking a couple years back  "
