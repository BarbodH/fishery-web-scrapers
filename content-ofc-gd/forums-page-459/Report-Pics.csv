649546,archie_james_c,2011-12-19 17:52:00,618," God I love battle worn Steel. Fresh chromers dont do anything for me anymore...no character.   Battle Worn, giving my best Solo Paddler smirk...also the day I cut my favorite rod (9' Lite/moderate Avid) in half *RIP Avid*  "
645974,TDunn,2011-12-06 22:47:00,680,"Hey Guys! What a fantastic fall we have had here in the north for steelheading. Prime water has been the norm. Honestly, I started fishing the tribs kind of late this season due to a busy work schedual. Most had hung up the rods and were driving by wearing blaze orange...perfect!!  Roe and spinner bite was hot first                      Had a few buds out for some chrome  first bow ever(water drop on the cam)   second bow ever     Pinkies started to produce            Twitching jiggy buggers worked well in the slow water once the water temps dropped              Took a ride last week up into Lake Superior Park and chased splake around in my kayak. Weather conditions were horrible but I managed to hit half a dozen in 2 hours.              2 of the fish i landed looked like this...the lake is only supposed to have splake.... I dunno...they got all laker jeans thats forsure      Went for a ride north this past sunday and to no surprise the rivers were blown. Turned around and hit the rapids for a couple hours.  Hit a spawned out atlantic on the float rod with a white jiggy bugger      Atlantic Release Video  Next up was this pig that almost pulled the rod out of my hands      Its been cold!! Bring on the ice!!             Hope you enjoyed!  TDunn"

645992,Rod Caster,2011-12-06 23:31:00,5784,Great scenery and fish shots Tyler!  Some of the early hens had huge shoulders.  I always enjoy spending time on that stretch of north shore heaven... wish I could spend more!  
645997,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-06 23:59:00,0,Those are typical fish for the St. Mary's (a river I have fished often)--pound for pound (though smaller) they are hard fighters!! Thanks for the nostalgia... I recognize the falls also  Cheers mate....
646000,trapshooter,2011-12-07 00:16:00,1234,Good fishing there Tyler.  Love the shots of the chrome with snow on the ground.

646351,cjgraham,2011-12-08 01:58:00,104,Very nice fish indeed. Best time to go north is now! Question for you. Ever fish the rapids in the winter? Dec/Jan?
646365,spinnerdoc,2011-12-08 02:47:00,556,You bet Tyler I enjoyed this    As always great report dude.
646369,TDunn,2011-12-08 03:14:00,680," Latest Ive been in  the rapids is mid dec because usually I'm on the ice around dec 15/16th. That being said, I might be there 1 or 2 more times myself this year. All depends when were walking on water....need some perch to eat!   Thanks to all for the kind words!  TDunn"
646398,NAC,2011-12-08 11:28:00,369,"Been wondering when I'd see a report from up there, niceness.  What's all that white stuff in the background?"
646432,TDunn,2011-12-08 13:48:00,680, Haha Hey man! Give me a shout tonight!
646454,Moosebunk,2011-12-08 15:08:00,3970,"Wickd Tyler!!!  Some great pics and man, what a place to call home."
646692,msp,2011-12-09 04:02:00,1336,Looks cold up there. A great fall / early winter for you so far. Good luck out on the ice this year !
646916,laszlo,2011-12-09 22:05:00,487,Always enjoy your reports Tyler. Keep it up.
648780,bassnass,2011-12-16 00:36:00,174,Cool report!
648944,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-16 17:58:00,0,"sweet.  looks like the sandbar was good to you this fall. found the fall slow but consistent myself.  i never really hit a banner day this fall, but also only went once without catching anything.  given the weather, steelheading might not be done yet either... hahaa="
648953,TDunn,2011-12-16 18:52:00,680,"  The sandbar was my home for a few weeks....lol and your right about the extended season...the last week has been the best action of the fall! Might hook up with jay over the xmas break if the bite Im on stays hot. If so, I'll let you know when were going. Thanks again to all!  TDunn"
648965,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-16 19:21:00,0,hmmm... i'm not sure jay knows how to use a float rod anymore... unless he's been pinning for 'cats on the 'peg. i think he gets in tomorrow.
