Just look at the contract GM`s have saddled us with; Gomez 3 more years of 7.3m, Gionta 3 more years of 5m, Cammalleri 3 more years of 6m,Plekanec 5 more years of 5m, Markov the one legged defenseman 3 more years of 5.75m  Too much dollars for underachieving players some of them should be ashamed to cash their paycheck!!!"
