649069,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-17 02:04:00,0,"i use a humminbird ice 45.   hell of a tool for any species in winter.  marcum and vex are awesome units, but perhaps a little more expensive.  at least they were when i bought mine.  as far as the flasher/finder debate, it's a moot point as long as your weapon of choice gives you results and confidence."
649080,farsider,2011-12-17 03:26:00,456,"If you just want the x67 ice machine...  Lebaron has it at $239 for the month of December or until they sell out.  Battery life could be an issue for some of the larger units.  Cheers, Mark"
649100,Jet,2011-12-17 07:31:00,364,"Since you like HB's, here's what you probably want and is well within your budget. It also has a flasher-mode so you'll essentially get both.  http://store.humminbird.com/products/356811/385ci_Combo_Portable?alt=3  There's also the GPS giving you the benefits already mentioned.  I have the non-gps version and works like a charm - and instantaneous I might add. So much in fact I think about four of my friends bought the same one after watching it during many successful Laker Chase games."
649395,Photoz,2011-12-18 20:23:00,792,"I have upgraded from an FL-8, to an FL-18  and now to an FL-22.   now all I need is ice. Once I tried a Flasher there was no turning back.  I also have my forward LCD fishfinder in my boat set to flasher mode.   Just for curiosity . . .   what improvements has the FL22 got that the FL20 didn't have? About all I could find . . . .    the FL22 only takes ya to 60', what do you do when fishin' lakers or whities in over 60' of water??"
649403,aplumma,2011-12-18 21:45:00,6896,If you know you are in water deeper than 60ft then the flasher will show 10ft meaning 70Ft etc.   Art
649409,Garnet,2011-12-18 22:43:00,2056,When you turn your unit on the flasher will go around the dial to 60 then past 10 ft = 70. Never looked at FL's. Should be a scale on inside of dial the goes from 70 to 120.

649417,GbayGiant,2011-12-18 23:40:00,1780,This new unit looks great. The best of both worlds in real time You can use it all summer/winter and it has gps as well.  http://radioworld.ca/more-fishing-products-ice-flashers-elite-5-icemachine-p-10069.html?osCsid=ec906f09a834966c60d2504477486ecc
649419,vinnimon,2011-12-19 00:05:00,2593,"I have made my decision, and I  do thank everyone for their opinions regardless. That was exactly the opinions I was looking for, godd orbadetc.  Well I think its best to get an hds7 or 8, more likely the 7. I have called around and did a slight bit of homework, price wise most place are within 50$ of the average. Now who do I buy one from ? who will beat another ones price by 10%?  The best I have come across price wise is 1099$ hds7 insight was in woodstock. Most places were 950 without the chip for a basemodel."
649430,scugpg,2011-12-19 00:46:00,1373, Hard to beat Jocelyn's prices. As you said anywhere else online is $950CDN for base model and I'm sure he'd try and match anything you can find.  You did lots of homework and congrats on your decision!

649462,scugpg,2011-12-19 03:03:00,1373, That is base model not insight and rebate is lowrance not dealer specific it just has to be a gen1 unit.

647503,irishfield,2011-12-12 01:01:00,26272,So am I Terry... I just pull the 102C off the bow of my boat and take it ice fishing all winter. The first 2 years I just sat out on my sled seat in -30C or worse while everyone else was toasty in their huts. Unit was as quick as I could tell... I move my jig... the screen moves in unison.  ..Now back to a guy asking about a flasher!!!
647508,Terry,2011-12-12 01:31:00,14456,well it's my fault it got off topic but someone was giving bad advise or at least was wrong info so I wanted to correct it and we ended up here
647528,GbayGiant,2011-12-12 02:33:00,1780, Terry is right for many reasons.
647530,Garnet,2011-12-12 03:06:00,2056,"Your amplitude scope is just a flasher. My 10 year old Zercon LCD flasher does the exact same thing it just doesn't show the history of your LCD screen.  The the first line of your lcd screen is the only reel time on the whole screen. You will still see Amplitude Scope mark before your lcd screen will mark anything, then you need 3-4 lines of history."
647534,BillM,2011-12-12 03:34:00,17367,"I can't imagine how I've smashed whities over the years with just a crappy LCD, I guess I'm just lucky"
647536,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-12 03:51:00,10439," Nope, you just live in a warm climate."
647538,WalleyeSlayer,2011-12-12 03:56:00,26,"I agree with Terry 100%  ... I use my x67c on my boat and all ice fishing season .. I've NEVER had the sonar delay on me... When I jig, my jig on the screen moves just as fast. I've used and abused my x67c yet it still performs like the day I bought it. I'm a firm believer that sonars work just as good as people claim there flashers work. I've used vexilars,marcums and hummingbirds flashers also and still go back to my x67c sonar .. It's more of what your confident with using.. I personally also like how I can see the history on mine for a bit and can change up my jigging technique right away if the fish on the screen doesn't react a certain way ... I'm thinking of getting the new elite-5 ice machine this year though   ... If not I'll gladly use my x67c in a heartbeat  Aadil"
647539,dhickey,2011-12-12 03:59:00,1038,  Count on it. Im in.
647540,ld17,2011-12-12 04:06:00,319,"What you want the flasher to have is a dual or tri beam transducer.  This will give you the option of fishing in shallow water or deep water.  Also look for things like battery status indicator.  It's nice to know how much power you have left.  Some have lights so you can use and see what's going on in the dark.  I would not recommend you using a lcd sonar on the ice. Forget the fact they are no where as cool as a flasher, but one thing I know is when things get really cold they tend to break much easier.  Flasher are bomb proof.  I'd hate to drop or bang an Lcd around in my hut or sled as I'm moving around on the ice.  Anyone with a Lcd what to take my challenge and drop your unit say 4 feet off the ground and see if it's still going to work. I'm almost sure my flasher would."
647574,Fishnwire,2011-12-12 12:00:00,983,"I'll admit I didn't read the whole thread...so I might be repeating what others have said.  I fished with no flasher/finder for years, and when I started taking my HB 565 portable out on the ice, it changed the way I fish.  You want some kind of sonar when you ice fish...of that there is no denying.  This idea that a fishfinder is not ""real-time"" is garbage.  Jig your bait and watch the display...there is no perceptible delay.  As far as display history goes...that part is actually quite nice, and I miss it a little bit now that I'm using an LX-5.  I still prefer my flasher over my finder for ice fishing though, for a couple of reasons.  First of, the puck is designed to hang straight up and down, unlike on my finder, where I was often friggin' around to get it to point straight down.  If it wasn't just right, I'd get a weak return (or none at all) off my jig, and I'd have this hassle every time I moved it from hole to hole.   Also the flasher is just more powerful...I can usually tell from the width/intensity of the return whether or not I still have bait on my jig.  If I had neither flasher nor finder, I'd probably look at the x-67...I'm pretty impressed with the performance for the money, and you can get transducers in both puck and transom-mount styles (I believe) so you'll be set for summer too.  All that said...the LX-5 is beyond awesome.  I'll get the LX-7 when my LX-5 dies or whatever, but like everyone I've ever talked to that has used one will tell you...it's a sweet machine."
647577,12footspringbok,2011-12-12 12:28:00,459,I think the bottom line here is some kind of sonar/flasher is better than none.  Converting what you see on your screen to fish on the ice is the important part!!!
647578,Fish Farmer,2011-12-12 13:14:00,2234,"I'll stick to my cheap Cuda 168 portable. I can't see myself changing my boats over to flashers.   Besides, it's the fisherman with a little luck that catches the fish."
647579,Grimace,2011-12-12 13:16:00,2020,Terry is absolutely right.  LCD fish finders are real time.  You jig and you see it jig at the same time.  The real time is on the far right of the screen though.  1/16th of an inch maybe.  I like the way the whole flashers communication with the user is for the exact moment your looking at it.  Once you really know how to use a good flasher for still fishing through the ice it is my opinion that it is superior to a normal fish finder type screen.  You can also use the other side of the flasher (the trail off) to look for inconsistencies that will tell you that a fish is super tight to the bottom.  I have jigged up plenty of walleye and called my shot when they were not even on the screen.  There are many tricks you can use with a flasher that you can't with the normal fish finder type screens.  Edit: iPhone autocorrect strikes again.

647620,Fisherman,2011-12-12 15:21:00,7201,
647638,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-12 16:06:00,10439," Another big plus of the puck (flat bottomed transducers) is that fact you can clear the snow off the ice and place the transducer on the ice, pour some water on the ice to couple the transducer to the ice and take depth readings right through the ice. But the ice has to be of good quality (black ice). I can easily shoot through over 5' of ice and have even marked fish through the ice. This is a huge bonus when you are drilling through that much ice. Blind drilling is a big waste of time in these conditions. IMHO  You could probably do it with a regular skimmer transducer but you would need to drill down 1/2"" or so and clean out the depression and use a ton more water to partially fill the hole.  It's all about efficiency  for me. There are no maps of the lakes here and to drill hundreds of holes through 5' of ice would leave no time to actually fish."
647641,wallyboss,2011-12-12 16:18:00,1095,"Dodge  or Ford ?????   I have upgraded from an FL-8, to an FL-18  and now to an FL-22.   now all I need is ice. Once I tried a Flasher there was no turning back.  I also have my forward LCD fishfinder in my boat set to flasher mode."
647642,Harrison,2011-12-12 16:20:00,2202,Here is another vote for a sonar.  I only use my flasher when fishing shallower for perch.  It's like watching a video game as you watch the laker streak up after the bait your pulling away from him.  Love it.
647788,vinnimon,2011-12-12 23:57:00,2593,"Thanks for your input guys:thumbsup_anim:  Ido have an hb 535 portablethat I use in my boat and bring along while icefishing, accompanied with an aquaview. Both of them I do like but I see a need to reduce the carrying weight. That is why i am in the market for a flasher.  Thanks again"
647798,Sinker,2011-12-13 00:26:00,8692,Your HB will show you the EXACT same thing a flasher will!  S.
647815,tonyb,2011-12-13 00:56:00,1637,"I have to agree with what Terry and CKRB2007 said regarding the Sonar over a Flasher.  I've always used a LCD Sonar and have had great success with it.  LCD sonars are easier to read, your jig and the fish move vertically in the water column, like the readout.  Flashers on the other hand display movemount around a 'dial', so it takes some interpretation and it's not quite as logical as the easy to read LCD.   Another benefit of the new Sonars is that many come with a built-in GPS antenna.  Couple that with a Navionics Chip and you have an incredible system at your disposal to explore new and old lakes alike with incredible detail of the bottom contours, and importantly your position on the lake.  Simply put, the fish don't stand a chance.  It's also an additional safety measure beyond your compass, should you get disoriented in a snow squall or fog.   Both systems work, but I thought I would share why I personally prefer an LCD Sonar.   Tony"
648426,OrangePeal,2011-12-14 22:34:00,37,"As Tony says.....most now have built in GPS. I just bought the ice ducer for my Humminbird and good to go.  Sold my old Vex to pay for the new transducer and power setup.  Safe Fishing First, Jack"
648808,vinnimon,2011-12-16 01:57:00,2593,"Well, I have sort of made my mind up, It will be an lcd for sure. Only reason being is it will have a dual purpose, both on and off the ice. I figured it would be best to upgrade my fish finder, from an HB 535 portable to a ?. I like the lawrence units but Ive always had an HB from the start and I am used to them.  The units price range that I amwilling to spend on this upgrade is aprox 1000$ max. I figured if i am spending 700 or so on a unit that I will only use for hard water, then why not go with a unit I can use all year round"
647309,MCTFisher9120,2011-12-11 13:40:00,3761," I second that, very nice units. Lot's of people seem to buy them."
647310,scugpg,2011-12-11 13:41:00,1373, Exactly. You can tune them out if you tweak some of the settings and with HDS you can also switch to 83khz which should eliminate the noise all together but 200khz is better for right below you.  I've never used flasher mode on an HDS before....once you use the graph you never go back.
647311,kickingfrog,2011-12-11 13:43:00,8333,"I like, and use, my fishfinder more.  I think the main reason is that it gives me a bit of ""history"" as to bottom contour on open water, and fish movement on the hard stuff."
647312,Terry,2011-12-11 13:47:00,14456,"I have nothing against flashers it was the only game in home in the beginning and I know people who have it down to a science , they love them but todays fishfinders are real time and with the Amplitude Scope bar (is a vertical flasher) they do everything the flashers do  and does have flasher mode if the mood strikes you IMO"
647313,strik,2011-12-11 13:51:00,175,I have the vex 18 love it  With that being said  this is my first flasher and the only one i have used  If i had to do it over again i would make the same purchase  i like the idea of using this flasher in the summer with the bottom lock  Good Luck
647322,Fish Farmer,2011-12-11 14:34:00,2234,"Lawrence Green Box flasher went out with the Doe Doe Bird. Why go back-wards to moving parts. LCD came on the market and we don't look back. Flasher is time display, you look away for a minute and you miss. At least with a LCD the mark will stay on the screen for awhile. I have a cheap Cuda portable works great. For whities I use the zoom and it works for me. 80"" foot of water I can see my jig on the bottom. I wonder if anyone uses the flasher mode on a LCD  I'm with Terry on this one."
647329,RickOnt,2011-12-11 15:01:00,669,"Well Vin you asked for ""View Points""  So here's my $.02!  I have been using the H-Bird 55 since Dec '08 and it is a great unit and I would highly recommend it!  But having said that I have seen all the makes at work Vex,Marcum and H Bird and they all work  and all do mark fish and all are accurate.  You need to learn how to set up your machine, how to read it and to trust what it is telling you.  The H-Bird 45 and 55,The Marcum Lx-5 and Lx-7 and the Vex Fl 18 and Fl 20 have similar functions and do pretty much the same job.  As for interference I have fished within 30' of my friends Lx 5 and no issues and a Bud has set up his Lowrance x67 in my portable so within 5 ft of the H Bird and no interference on either unit.  As for the best unit for the $$ and what will work as advertised you will be hard pressed to find a better deal right now than the Lowrance 67-Icemachine, Gagnons had them on for $249 as a door crasher but you can still get them for $279.  On another note!!  In '08 when I bought my H-Bird 55 I did not have a fishing boat.  This last summer I bought a boat and am now looking at a Lowrance HDS Gen 2 Likely the 7.  As Terry stated this gives you more options again, GPS with mapping and set up to be portable would be a year round use!!  SaltyDawg   Whenever we get Ice here on Simcoe/Cooks Bay and you are in the neihborhood look me up and I would be more than happy to show you the H-Bird in action   Rick"
647334,Sinker,2011-12-11 15:12:00,8692,"I'm another graph guy. No need for a flasher. My graph marks the same fish as any flasher does, and I get to use it all season long.  S."
647343,BillM,2011-12-11 15:43:00,17367," Buy a normal fish finder instead, a lot easier to read"
647345,ckrb2007,2011-12-11 16:04:00,449,I'd also take a graph type finder over a flasher any day. You can tell a lot from just a little bit of history on the screen.
647353,esoxcrazy,2011-12-11 16:31:00,22,"Flasher over LCD in cold weather anyday.  I would have to say my Ice-55 has been my best asset fishing for all seasons.  The realtime reading of the flasher will be that split second you need some days on your display.  With the power of the unit I use it all year and just have the puck in a bit of water in the bottom of my grumman canoe and can mark my 1/32oz jig in 20ft of water.  I have had mine since '08 and have had to replace the motor in it last year (warranty) and they gave me another full year warranty on the unit.  I think the 55 and the marcum lx-5 are the best of the best and each have there own pros.  I fished with the showdown a fair bit last year and still found the display slow compared to the top end flasher.  I know there are a thousand people using the lowrance X-67, and basic fishfinders will work, but I like my unit to react the same in all fishing conditions.  I have seen the slowness at cold temps with LCD.  I cannot say enough about the hummingbird line and I am not gonna knock the vex as I don't have much experience with them and we have no local retailer so it was off my radar when choosing.  The seperation will blow you away with the 55, especially in deep water. My only complaint with the hummingbird is the ability to reduce/increase the gain, from 1-50 you will need at least a setting of 40 even in 20 ft or less.  either no power or full power."
647358,Terry,2011-12-11 16:39:00,14456,can you tell me one modern lcd fishfinder that isn't real time  I think that is a marketing ploy for flashers and they are right they are real time but so are all my fishfinders  and my unit reacts just fine in -30 but my x67c and my hds5  again 100% real time on the Amplitude Scope bar everything to the left is wonderful history  but the OP wants a flasher and they are a fine piece of equipment and will serve you well and I can't argue that
647384,Photoz,2011-12-11 18:20:00,792,"I had an FL8 SE for 4 years, not used a lot . . .   I sold it to Big Cliff about 3 years ago, not because there was anything wrong with it . . . .    I just needed a new toy! Not long after I sold the FL8 and bought an FL20 I found it wasn't $250.00 better than the FL8. Yeah, for the DEEP water (100+') for whities & lakers, if definitely gives you an edge . . .   .   but I did fine with the FL8 too. If ya like fancy playthings and got a few extra bucks you don't mind parting with the FL22 is where it's at. My only minor complaint is the read-out is kinda small . . .   gotta use the readin' glasses to see the numbers! The battery is good for at least 2  - 8 hour fishing expeditions, and keeps it's charge for a lo o o o n g time, nearly a year unattended (I forgot about it)and the battery was still at about 80%!"

647399,limeyangler,2011-12-11 19:23:00,5204,   Erm...dude...the ice-55 is also an LCD display.
647439,Garnet,2011-12-11 21:27:00,2056,The high end Hummingbird and Lowrance are combination LCD and Flasher. Watch your rightside screen the first 2 vertical lines.  Humingbird call it RST Mode = fancy words for flasher mode. Lowrance call it Active line = fancy words for flasher mode.  By the time anything gets on your LCD screen it's history.
647443,Terry,2011-12-11 21:37:00,14456,never heard of these words you are using..but everything on the lcd screen is lcd on Lowrance the bar on the right Amplitude Scope bar is lcd and is real time and clearly everything to the left is history and still lcd  as already stated in this thread   
647459,BillM,2011-12-11 22:41:00,17367, I've never seen a LCD with a delay of any kind while on the ice.  Even the lower end units.
647461,scugpg,2011-12-11 22:48:00,1373,I've never seen a delay on an LCD either.  You see the fish in real time and you can see the slightest movement on your lure right on the graph and there is no delay on the screen!
647462,Fisherman,2011-12-11 23:00:00,7201,Some just have to justify spending piles of money on their rotating rainbow of colours.  One thing for sure that neither can do is predict whether or not the fish will bite.
647468,Garnet,2011-12-11 23:22:00,2056,Terry you are right everything on right is LCD Flasher and there is noticeable delay until your LCD screen gets enough history.  Get your manual out and read it.

They were noticibly lagging due to the cold. The only lcd units that I would even think of using up here are those designed for ice fishing as the screens are heated.
647498,BillM,2011-12-12 00:43:00,17367,I've had my Humminbird 747c out on some pretty cold days..  Only thing I've noticed is the battery draining a bit faster then normal..  It's seen -20 on more then a few occasions.
647499,Terry,2011-12-12 00:46:00,14456,"me too  my x67c is made for the ice so maybe it has a heater and the hds5 has a computer in it and gets warm on it's own, so maybe older or cheaper ones do freeze up a bit but not mine"
647103,vinnimon,2011-12-10 21:18:00,2593,"I plan on purchasing a flasher very soon, but i am not sure of which one to get.I would prefer to get the top of the the line,but I know that I wont use it to its fullest potential. I have experience using a few but im not sure which one to go with. Any view points good or bad, no matter on any that you guys have used will be apreciated. I also have an aqua view in which I do like in most situations, but with a few that ive been in it was a pain in really deep water. Any suggestions would be greatly apreciated, thanks a ton."
647104,Old Man,2011-12-10 21:37:00,822,"Any flasher is better than no flasher. Get what you like and can afford. I myself have a Vexlar FL 8 Genz Pack. Is it the best, probably not. Is better than no flasher, definitely. You probably can't go wrong with any of the current flashers on the market IMHO."
647105,Leecher,2011-12-10 21:38:00,7832,"Vinny, can't give you advice on the said subject since I don't own one but if I was going to purchase a flasher for hard water fishing, I would definitely go for a Vexilar FL20 Pro Pack  Vexilar FL20"
647106,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-10 21:47:00,10439,  You can't really go wrong with any of them. I have a Marcum LX-5 and it is a very good unit. The movable zoom and super fine line as well as the dual beam transducer are important to me. It also has the best target separation and most power of all the top units as well. I have heard good things about the HBird flashers as well.
647122,phiphntek,2011-12-10 22:44:00,115,  I have a Hummunbird Ice 45 going into its second season this winter.Very pleased with it.I's middle of the line but has most features of the Ice 55.... a little less power.Used it for shallow perch and deep lake trout.One freind has got one for this year and another will be getting one for Christmas.Prefer it over Vex and Marcum due to the larger read out.
647126,EC1,2011-12-10 22:48:00,930,"It's time for the LX-7! I think it's been said many times for all sorts of different equipment, but spend as much as you can afford to on it!  Any finder is better than no finder. I still use a portable Humminbird b/w that freezes when it gets too cold Lol. It doesn't feel right to fish Scugog in 8FOW without my finder now though.  And for those that like those Humminbird flashers, I just always have a hard time reading a flasher where your jig goes downwards on the screen when you jig upwards. Not for me, but I bet lots of people love it."
647134,Grimace,2011-12-10 22:58:00,2020,"I have been around most of the units.  The best one in my opinion is the Marcum LX-5.  I have a Vexilar FL-18 and absolutely love it.  Like others have said, all the flasher units right now are very good quality.   If I was in the market for a new one, I would pick up the LX-5."
647135,uglyfish,2011-12-10 23:01:00,981,"I have a humminbird ice 55. Excellant unit, easy to use. Love the zoom feature on it. And the digital display is great."
647138,TroutSlayer,2011-12-10 23:33:00,64, I've owned and used both Marcum and Vex over the years. I only use the Marcum LX5 now. The movable zoom is important for me when fishing suspended Specks.
647155,Nipfisher,2011-12-11 00:10:00,2449,"Vinny, you could go with one of the Showdown models if it is specifically for the ice. Showdown flasher    I bought the PP1 portable kit for my HDS5 (Terry has the same one) and it has a digital flasher on it as well as a real time column. I can watch a 1/8 oz jig 1 inch off bottom in 15 fow."
647160,adempsey,2011-12-11 00:32:00,1498,"I don't think you can go wrong with any of the current models.   I think in terms of technology and quality of the output, they're all very similar when you compare the various units at each price point.  So, IMO, you really have to go and look at them so you can make direct comparisons.    For example, the Marcum LX-5 screen diameter is a bit smaller than the Humminbird and it has a small shield instead of the flat screen.  However, I find the Humminbird to be louder and vibrate more but I prefer the flat screen.  If you fish at night some of the units don't have a night mode which many anglers find annoying (it's blinding at night).  Having the transducer on a floater versus an arm (I removed the arm from my Marcum and use a Vex floater). Little differences like that will most likely sway you.  Assuming the price is the same.   Also, don't forget to compare what's included in the package. For example, I believe some of the Vexilars don't have a carrying case, but the Humminbirds and Marcums include that (at least that's my recollection).  Availability might be an issue as well.  Humminbird is everywhere.  Vexilar is also quite popular, but not sure how many stores carry the Marcums.  If you don't mind ordering online, then this is non-issue of course.  If you're going for top of the line I think either a Marcum LX7 or LX5, Humminbird ICE55 or the Vexilar FL20 (note: the FL22HD only goes to 60FOW max) will make you happy.  That HDS-5 with the PPP-18I Ice Pack sounds like a really sweet package as well."
647208,rdambros,2011-12-11 02:02:00,71,"Vinni, I don't think it has been mentioned, but I would suggest that you buy whatever your friends are fishing. Different manufacturers flasher will interfere with other manufacturers. This is especially true for the Marcum flashers. So, if all your friends have Marcums, then buy a Marcum and spend as much as you can afford. Rember that means at least $350.  I just bought the HB Ice55 and I am impressed with the fit and finish. It comes with the carrying case, which may be important, but all the of the units will fit in a five gallon pail.  Let us all know what you buy."
647261,mike rousseau,2011-12-11 03:56:00,4661,Really depends on fishing styles...  But a lot of vexilars are coming with a TRI-ducer  And the ultra pack option is nice...  I have a fl-8 ultra pack and it's perfect for me... I usualy fish 5-50 feet of water and it performed fine...  Only thing I wish I had was zoom on the bottom... But I think the higher end models have that...
647275,dhickey,2011-12-11 04:59:00,1038,I have never had electronic gear for ice fishing I always relied on maps and gutt feeling(weather patterns light levels/currents excetra) So now that Im getting a little older Im looking for any advantage I can find not only for myself but my kidds are getting a little boured catching perch not to mention several others that I would like to take out fishing.  Just to clear things up. Best results are on my own or with a few others that know how to ice fish.  So my question is do theese flashers/fish finders actualy help find fish or help you catch fish?  Lure choices not withstanding.  What should I expect to pay$ for a quality unit?  Portable/reliable/durable accurate?  Thanks for any advice please feel free to pm me if you are not comfortabe talking $.  Saltydawg.
647277,BillM,2011-12-11 05:19:00,17367,"Saltydawg  Absolutely.  99% of my whitie and laker catches are on the take (Meaning I'm coaxing the fish up from the bottom).... I've had lakers hit 10ft below the hole coming out of 100ft of water.  Same goes with the whities, it's usually at least 20-30ft off bottom when they hammer my spoon.  Can't do that without a finder  When I think about it, I can't believe I even wasted time ice fishing for whities/lakers without one.  Sure you'll have lucky days when the fish are hot, but that's not usually the case."
647284,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-11 05:46:00,10439,^^^^^ What Bill says is true. It will enable you to catch many more fish than without one. I can't hit the ice without my flasher. Case in point 2 weeks ago I only managed to catch 3 fish one was a no brainer as it railed my jig. The other two came in to my bait but I would have never known as it took me a long time to tease them into hitting. Without the flasher I would have just been jigging blindly and not working the fish that were actually there.
647287,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-11 06:07:00,2582,Vinny if you compare those in a similar price range. They are all pretty much the same. I have a lowly Vex FL8 and have no intentions of upgrading. It does what I need it to do.  I am pretty much a perch fisherman through the ice. Does the unit catch me more fish? I really don't think so...but I have fished perch for years and have go to lures and go to locations.  But I have to say I do love watching things unfold on the screen. Bringing fish up off the bottom  or targeting specific suspended fish and watching them home in on your bait is very entertaining. I do these things randomly anyway as from years of perching I know to mix up my presentations to attract fish...so like I said I usually get those fish anyway. It's just so much more fun being able to watch it happen   Electronics IMHO make it way more fun.
647289,dhickey,2011-12-11 06:28:00,1038, So would you be willing to show me how to fish using a flasher? When I buy one I will not be familar with the basic aplications.  Cooks bay ?perch would be a good start.? Ill bring the food and bait.
647290,dhickey,2011-12-11 06:28:00,1038, double click.
647296,TDunn,2011-12-11 11:33:00,680,"flasher will double your catch no doubt. I wont ice fish very often without a flasher unless I'm snowshoeing deep into the interior of LSPP.  Currently I have a fl8 slt but I'm upgrading by xmas to a fl-18 or 20.  I think I'm going to go with the fl 18-tri beam. Don't see a huge difference between the 18 and 20's. That being said I think there is a huge difference between the fl 12 and 18.  18's have the Bottom Lock which can come in handy during open water too!  Honestly, Buy the best deal you can find. They all rock man!   TDunn"
647298,Terry,2011-12-11 12:30:00,14456,"you need a fishfinder  I will go head to head with anyone me with a hds5 and you with you flasher but I do need to be far enough away from you to get away from the rf splatter from your unit and when the ice goes, I will hook up my expensive piece of equipment to my boat you will find a nice place on a shelf for yours"
647299,Garnet,2011-12-11 12:39:00,2056,Theirs no reason to put your flasher on the shelf for boat season. Nothing better for weedlines.
647300,Roy,2011-12-11 12:43:00,13728, X10  Most good quality sonars have flasher mode too....most people don't use it.
647307,Terry,2011-12-11 13:30:00,14456,OK POLL  how many people regularly take there flasher on their boats for weedlines
647308,mercman,2011-12-11 13:37:00,7054,"Not me, dont even know how a flasher works , even though my unit has the flasher option on it."
