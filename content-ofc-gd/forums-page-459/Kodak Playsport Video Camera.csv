I like the looks of this Kodak http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/pd/PLAYSPORT_Video_Camera_BURTON_Edition__Zx5/productID.233830100    Staples has it for $50 off right now. Does anybody have any opinions on this one? It has everything that I need including a nice mount, it's waterproof, shockproof and comes with a remote.  I always look to you guys before making any big purchases."
649355,Kingsalmon,2011-12-18 16:19:00,107,Ask Aaron Shirley about that camera.  I think he uses one and is somewhat associated with Kodak.
649357,irishfield,2011-12-18 16:19:00,26272,Probably takes better pictures than my Mom's old Super 8 !!
649372,danbouck,2011-12-18 17:31:00,4380,Thanks Aaron!
