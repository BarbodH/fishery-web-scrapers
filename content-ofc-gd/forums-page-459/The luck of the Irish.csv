649311,lew,2011-12-18 12:39:00,12766,"Awhile back my daughter bought a lottery ticket & won $500  Last month  she won a trip to the Bahamas.  All expenses paid, all inclusive with airfare, transportation, hotel, food, drinks and even gratuities, for 2 people and she's going in February.  Yesterday she bought a lottery ticket & won $75  I think I'll give her some $$$$ to invest for me"
649313,skeeter,2011-12-18 12:54:00,1907,How much can I pitch in too? It's nice to hear she's on a roll.
649314,lew,2011-12-18 12:57:00,12766, They say things happen in 3's Dann but hopefully it gets extended for her
649320,Skipper D,2011-12-18 13:23:00,1970,Don't let the box of LUCKY CHARMS run out Lew .
649323,Rod Caster,2011-12-18 13:36:00,5784,"My Mom is the same way. She's won trips, concerts, cd's, a bike and countless other things. When I bought my first car after college, a Mercury Sable, she asked me to drop off a ballot at the dealership... Well that ticket won her and Dad a trip to Mexico! Edited to add: she's Irish as well"
649328,mercman,2011-12-18 13:53:00,7054,"Hummmmm ""Caster"".....S0 What part a Ireland are ya from lad?  Good things happen to good people guys. That says it all"
649331,Grimace,2011-12-18 14:01:00,2020,"My sister in law is like that.   Wins laptops, trips to Florida, caribbean and a bunch of other places.  One time she won two trips at the same time and had to give one away.  It really is quite remarkable.  I say take her to the race track and ask her what horse she likes.  Slap the works on it.  Worse thing that could happen is that you would just have to go back to fire fighting.  From what I gather, you like fire fighting anyways.   :-)"
649332,lew,2011-12-18 14:05:00,12766," I did enjoy firefighting, very much, but I enjoy retirement MUCH more"
649334,Rod Caster,2011-12-18 14:08:00,5784, I should change my screen name to Rod McCaster
649335,mercman,2011-12-18 14:12:00,7054,  Then i'd have to be McMercman. How the McEll are ya !!!
649336,lew,2011-12-18 14:18:00,12766,"Speaking of Irish.....  Waaaay back in 1953 some good friends of my folks won $56000 on the Irish Sweepstakes which was an absolute fortune back then.  I don't know what it would convert to in todays dollar but it would probably still be huge.  They were just newly married & it set them up really nice as they bought a new house, furniture, car and whatever else they needed.  Bad part though, was after they won the loot, they abandoned all their old ""poor"" friends."
649337,Skipper D,2011-12-18 14:19:00,1970,I ........ and then me to...... McSkippy .
649347,Rod Caster,2011-12-18 15:34:00,5784," That would be a huge payout for someone in Ireland back then. I've been reading Frank McCourt books, so if their living conditions were anything of the like, I can almost understand how they'd want to get out. Franks early years were in the 1930s so maybe things had gotten a bit better in the 50's... Still it doesn't seem the most honourable thing to do to leave your people in the dust. Did they move to Canada after winning or stay in Ireland?"
649350,lew,2011-12-18 15:54:00,12766," Oops, guess you misunderstood me, sorry bout that.  The folks who won the money lived in Toronto and it was called the Irish Sweepstakes"
649353,Rod Caster,2011-12-18 16:17:00,5784," Oops. That was well before my time, never heard of the Irish sweepstakes... I figured that was the lottery in Ireland"
649356,Billy Bob,2011-12-18 16:19:00,5865,"McBilly Bob....sounds like something you would order from McDonald's dollar menu....  BTW Lew, What's your daughter doing the first week of April....do you think she would like to meet us in Vegas...."
649359,lew,2011-12-18 16:25:00,12766," If you pay for her trip in full Bob, I'm sure she could suggest a few wagers for you, although I doubt she'd guarantee the results"
649367,Billy Bob,2011-12-18 17:05:00,5865," OK, tell her meet us there and we will reimburse her from her net winning suggestions..."
649630,Tybo,2011-12-19 22:39:00,1373,"Lew, Alot of the times they don't abandon their friends.What happens is you fall out of the social click. NO morage.car payment,Education and retirement payed for(nose not being held to the grind stone).You loss the common bonds between friends."
