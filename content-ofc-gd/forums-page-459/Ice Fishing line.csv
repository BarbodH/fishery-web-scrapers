649756,SirWhite,2011-12-20 04:40:00,210,"Looking for a ""tried and true"" ice line /combo line for this coming season. Always, in the past (4 times lol) I've used my regular mono (Trout, in BC). Now, being in southern Ontario and fishing for things that have teeth (Walleye, Pike) Im struggling to figure out Flouro, Mono, or both. Its racking my brain.  Anyone ?"
649762,Freshtrax,2011-12-20 07:10:00,2215,I like 15pound braid with 8pound floro from the swivel down while fishin for lakers.  Not much stretch in the 100FOW when i switched to braid i started catchin allot more whitefish i just never felt the hits with mono.
649766,steverowbotham,2011-12-20 09:16:00,1800,"For perch I use 2lbs fireline with a 2-3lbs fluoro leader For lakers I use 6 lbs fireline with a 6-8lbs fluoro leader.  I use lighter than than most, use whats best suited to you.  If you're rip jigging a williams, you'll want heavier line."
649799,Nipfisher,2011-12-20 13:45:00,2449,My ice lines have the Northland Bionic line on some and Fireline Ice on the others. Both in 8 pounds test. I prefer the fireline Ice to the Bionic but I just put the Bionic on last year with about 2 weeks in the season so I'll continue to try it out. Bionic line They have the new fluorosilk and braid out but I just have the regular line. FireLine I bought the Fireline Micro Fused Ice Crystal and will give it a go as soon as I can. I have used the FireLine in the past and have been impressed.
649802,BillM,2011-12-20 13:57:00,17367,+1 on 6lb FC and 4-6lb Drennan flouro.
649804,asdve23rveavwa,2011-12-20 14:05:00,2690,"Yup, another vote for the FC.  Giving Pline Fluoroice a shot on one combo this year."
649810,mike rousseau,2011-12-20 14:25:00,4661,If your in a hut fireline crystal... Outside a hut... Pline floroice is good... Landed a 10lb pike on 2lb floro last year...
650047,archie_james_c,2011-12-21 04:17:00,618,"  What he said.   Although, I've been known to slum straight 6 lb flouro for April whitefish/steelhead through the ice.  Tomorrow Splake are on the menu, 6lb Sensation Solar Orange mainline, 6 lb chameleon leader, changing it up only to say I did  Hard to beat 15 pound braid with ________ leader."
