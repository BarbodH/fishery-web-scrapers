The week started off with some really high winds from south east so nobody was able to get out for a fish. We finally managed to set our lines and starting trolling in pursue of the Great Ontario Salmon Derby winner.  Here are a couple of pictures of a great Salmon we caught earlier in the week   Anthony thinking “This salmon is almost as big as me”   The Salmon are now staging all river mouths and are right in the shallow water. In the early morning the fish are right in tight to shore, then they seem to move out with the boat traffic and as the sun rises. There are many anglers starting to catch some great salmon of shore right now.  The keys to our success this week was, using A-tom-mik Trolling Flies of dipsy divers and rigger lines for most of our fish. Cut bait, “Meat” with flashers was also a great choice for some of our bigger fish.  Here are some more pictures of some great late season salmon  Mike who mainly fishes Lake Michigan enjoying some good size        Nice Male that took over 500 feet of line on one run, good job guys getting the fish in   Some action from out in the “Blue Zone” Deep water Lots of rainbows and a ton of fun  Some great cohos as well out deep     It was a great finish to a fantastic Salmon derby with some great fish being caught all week. Now it is time for some Musky and bass fishing with some casting for big salmon mixed in, then walleye later in the fall. Cheers Al www.alsadventures.ca"
