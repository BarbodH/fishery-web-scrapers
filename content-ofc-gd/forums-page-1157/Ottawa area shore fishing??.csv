It looks like I'm staying seconds from the Ottawa river...Brittania Bay I think it's called... Here's a map...green arrow is the street were staying at... http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=scrivens%20st...sa=N&tab=wl I won't have alot of time, so I would like to gather as much info as possible before I leave. What is anything can I catch casting from shore nearby? Any other areas I should check out close by? Thx Mike"

Just take your bike and ride down past the Brittiania Boat Club and head for the water works plant.  As you get to the City of Ottawa water works.  Just walk your bike over to the edge of the water.  Start casting.  Enjoy.  Lots of Smallmouth, pike, walleye, trout are caught there every year.  There is a real honey hole but I will let you find that on your own."
