107856,dmo84,2007-08-27 07:32:00,8,"Had the pleasure of getting out fishing with the boys (Shorelunch and my buddy Jeff) the past couple days and we did alright.  Saturday we went out to Dog lake and got out around 5oclock and started fishing.  The bite was slow but we kept at it and about an hour in I got this one that was just under four and a half.  Pic was taken at the launch at the end of the night as we didnt have the camera in the boat, the fish was released however.    Jig and pigged  The bite was slow for the rest of the day and we did get a few more that I regret not getting pics of but they were smaller fish.  Today we got out a bit earlier on Buck lake and the bite was on immediately.  I tossed on a spinnerbait and on my second cast hooked into a nice 4lb+ pike which turned into quite the fight as it hit right at the boat.  It was difficult getting the hook out and it was released without a picture...I do wish I had got a pic for the report but next time ill be sure to get one.  Now this is where it got fun....about 10 minutes later again my spinnerbait got crushed and the fight was on....the fish was not coming up at all and kept diving with alot of power....I figured I had  a big pike on until this big boy surfaced from under the boat finally.      5lb 10 oz  After that the bite slowed down and we didnt catch much until later in the evening.  I hooked into another nice 4lb+ pike and we got some smaller bass but didnt take any pics.  Overall it was a fun day on the water and the fishing was good."
