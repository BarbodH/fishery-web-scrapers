108294,Gerritt,2007-08-28 14:58:00,6129,For those of you that have read the article would you vote for one party or another based upon our natural resources and their management..  This is not a thread to decide what party you are going to vote for (So no political bashing please)  I just want to know if you would one way over another if say the MNR was given 35 million dollars more a year and have the MNR assume control of fish Hatcheries ....  I think it would certainly sway my vote..  Gerritt.
108302,Golfisher,2007-08-28 15:15:00,586,"Other things being equal, yes, but MNR funding is just one issue among many, and each party has a different take on them.  It won't likely sway me."
108306,ccmtcanada,2007-08-28 15:21:00,7971,"I agree with Golfisher...all other things being equal, then yes, it could sway me."
108309,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-28 15:24:00,698,I voted for the Harris government based on the fact they promised to put the money from fishing licences back into conservation instead of the general treasury.
108310,LeXXington,2007-08-28 15:24:00,1928,"I would like to see a plan,  Over the years all parties have said they would and not followed up on the promise.  Like everyone else its just one more thing to tip the scales."
108311,Gerritt,2007-08-28 15:25:00,6129,Yes I agree all other things being somewhat equal.... it is a great issue. Packed full of information.... definably worth the read.  Gerritt.
108319,tonyb,2007-08-28 15:41:00,1637,"Looking forward to reading that issue...  Each party will not fulfill their pre-election promises, so if I was to vote for any party, I guess I would vote for the one lying to me about improving the fishery over any others  But it is a toss up between selecting 'None of the above' vs a party that is blatantly lying to me.  Tony"
108350,bigfish1965,2007-08-28 17:17:00,3382,"So far we've not seen one party at all put anything meaningful into the MNR since the early 1990's. With the rising cost of healthcare and education, it is a tough sell for any party to say ""We're taking this 100m and putting into fish and squirrel stuff rather than new MRI's or a cancer clinic'. It is a tough reality."
108410,taper,2007-08-28 21:14:00,611,"I agree with every one so far and also think that we need to think of our resources from the Green stand point and stop polluting at every level. Not saying the green party just that whole outlook on our country. I have given these type of issues more weight in the last couple of years than ever before, maybe it's because I'm getting older maybe it's the OFC influence."
108434,motv8tr,2007-08-28 22:38:00,2587,"Hmmm...going to have to take another look at this months issue, just got it today and it's strictly hunting which i'm not interested in so I tossed it in the recyle...might have to go dig it out  Maureen"
108436,Gerritt,2007-08-28 22:46:00,6129,"  It is also a tough reality that if we dont do it... we risk losing Billions to our Economy... Both in direct fishing tourist cash.. but the economy our fishing tourists create.. 10's of thousands of jobs would be effected.. especially hard hit would be northern ontario.. From Dock boy to TJ's Marketing business... It would go right up the line as lodges close because our waters have become fishless wastelands...  a sad state of affairs.. The MNR is a vital part of our economy.. The conservatives started the ball rolling in Slashing their budget... The liberals added about a dozen more CO's... Problem is they just dont have the funding... We need more $$, a better method of control for how $$ is spent and Officers hired to ensure the North does not go bankrupt (Tourists)... as it is right now with softwood and the cancellation of the Spring Bear Hunt...  If things continue as they are Look forward to a MASS migration towards Toronto...  Something needs to be done and while our opinions here on OFC do little... we can affect change.. with our votes!  Gerritt."
108449,fishindevil,2007-08-28 23:36:00,6254,"Yes im glad that OOD, did that in this months issue..  .and yes it will make a huge factor when i vote thats for dam sure   !!!!!!! it goes along way to show who really cares about the state of our fisheries here in ontario..  .everyone should read it,if i know how to copy it i would  its a good read   cheers    AND AS A MEMBER MYSELF THEY ARE ALL WE GOT IN THE FRONT LINES TO FIGHT FOR US TOO...."
108466,TJQ,2007-08-29 00:09:00,7806,I just got the issue and will have to read it... but they all lie anyway...
