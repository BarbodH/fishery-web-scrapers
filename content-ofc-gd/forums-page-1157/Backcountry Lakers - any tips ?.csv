Have zero experience and no specialized gear ( no downriggers , lead core etc)  The lake appears to be a good candidate for lakers as we always see boats trolling , it a small lake but deep at 100 feet plus and also stocked.  Bottom bouncers and spoons or inline spinners? what trolling speed?  Appreciate any info you might have to offer , I promise a report when we return  TB"
108245,tinbanger,2007-08-28 11:44:00,1028,Just did what I should have done in the first place ..search !  Mikemo had  a post in June with a great link  -  Laketrout.org - that has just what I was looking for .  Still open to advice.  TB
108287,Nemo,2007-08-28 14:18:00,727,Yep that is a good site. But I would recommend a portable downrigger. Canon Mini Troll at CTC.
108293,solopaddler,2007-08-28 14:57:00,8605,Simplest way is trolling with a Wolf River rig. With the bell sinker being in the 2-4oz range and the mainline being braid.
108355,douG,2007-08-28 17:31:00,2693,"That Wolf River rig is a three way rig, tied using a (wait for it) three way swivel."
108360,jedimaster,2007-08-28 17:53:00,3472,a 2 ounce bottom bouncer and floating crankbait works good from a canoe.
108361,Headhunter,2007-08-28 18:11:00,5703,"Offshore snap weights attached to your line, about 50ft in front of your lure/bait will act as a poor man's downrigger very well. http://www.offshoretackle.com/weights.htm  Give'm a try, they worked pretty well for me in a similar situation, just vary your speed and or weight to achieve the depth you seek!
