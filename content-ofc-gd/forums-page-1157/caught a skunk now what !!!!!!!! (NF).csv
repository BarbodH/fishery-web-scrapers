106270,jedimaster,2007-08-22 19:50:00,3472,I think the moral of this thread is when you have a skunk in a box...Don't miss the opportunity to totally ruin someones day that deserves to have there day ruined.  ANd don't forget to take the photos.

106273,lew,2007-08-22 19:58:00,12767,"One day at work I came across a skunk in a live release trap at an abandoned house. I just slowly walked towards the animal, carefully opened the cage and he happily wandered off into the sunset.  I always find it interesting that some people feel the need to kill every critter that crosses their path."
106310,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-22 21:34:00,1183,So what happened?  Are you bathing in tomatoe juice?  lol
106319,motv8tr,2007-08-22 21:57:00,2587,"  My boyfriend does this once or twice a month, and has done for the past several years, he's yet to be sprayed.  He did say that a white sheet seems to be the best.  As far as tomato juice goes, thanks to my dogs and cats I'd say no, I keep a bottle of ""skunk off"" around just in case....use it minimum once a year."
106372,bushman,2007-08-22 23:42:00,23,I was always told if you pick it up by the tail it can't spray if his feet are not on the ground .Then drop him and run fast .
106373,danc,2007-08-22 23:49:00,4677,Don't feel too bad ufish2. I occasionally catch Pike and I think that they smell much worse. I'd rather catch a skunk.
106376,Jigatollah,2007-08-22 23:55:00,53,You could hug it and squeeze it and call it George.
106466,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-23 02:57:00,835,"I saw a guy use dynamite to get rid of a skunk and I'm sure it didn't feel a thing.    If you put your garden hose on a fan spray and point it at the skunk you can walk right up to it and the water will knock down the spray.               He- HE- HE    Now are you ready for the dynamite.   Take it for a walk to the end of a dock, if it looks scared of the water it has rabies, throw him in."
106468,pameladallaire,2007-08-23 03:00:00,470,"OK, FOR THE LAST TIME, write this on a piece of paper and stick it to your frig!  This means EVERYONE on OFC!!  Homemade Skunk Off smell cleaner:  (for skunks, dog and cat pee smell, anything organic)  I wonder if it works on fish smell??  anyway, back to the recipe.  1/4 cup baking soda 1 Tbsp. liquid dish soap 1 whole BIG bottle peroxide THAT'S IT!  mix and smear on smelly person, animal, sprayed cage, etc.  Rinse, dry, forget about it.  I had my lab sprayed twice in one hour, washed him outside in the snow, stuck him to dry in front of the wood stove and he was asleep in my camper bunk within one hour!  It works better than any commercial recipe.  Just remember to keep a few bottles of peroxide in your house or cottage at all times.  Beats walking into an allnight pharmacy smelling like skunk.  Pam"
106501,Cookslav,2007-08-23 04:18:00,1457,"My vote.... Be rational. Just Stay in front of him, be calm (no sudden movements or noises) & slowly open the cage....they aint so fast that you can't get out of the way before he turns a full 180 degrees on you and gets his tail up, aimed and starts a spray'n.  If you want to take a chance at stinking your truck up I s'pose you could take him outta town but, chances are he is not comming back after this ordeal anyway so I'd recomend just cutting him loose.  But if your not comfortable doing it....just call the SPCA"
106509,kemper,2007-08-23 06:10:00,2232,"I had a skunk jump out in front of my on the trail to a bass pond last month, scared the crap out of the thing iguess and he turned and sprayed, luckily as soon as i saw the white stripe i RAN FASTER THAN I HAVE EVER RUN BEFORE and got out of the range of spray i geuss?  Whole cottage stank, but he didnt get me!"
106528,pikehunter,2007-08-23 10:11:00,1659,"My father used to trap them because the neighbourhood was over run with them. At one time the SPCA would take them and do whatever with them. Then they started to charge and I believe later they wouldn't take them.  So with that he started to dispose of them himself. He would carefully take the trapped skunk in the trunk of his car to a different location where he could open the trap door and let the skunk roll down a hill. This way if the skunk got ticked off it would spray the hillside and not him, or me the spectator.  If your trap is low enough the skunk can't lift it's tail. If it can't lift it's tail it can't spray. So you should be safe  Good luck and look at this as a new ""fun"" challenge."
106656,Headhunter,2007-08-23 15:55:00,5703,"I've heard that if you spray them with a hose, really soak them down, they won't be able to lift their tail, with the weight of the water on it and therefore won't be able to spray you. HH"
106661,douG,2007-08-23 16:10:00,2693,What a great thread.  I sure am luvin the OFC.
106680,Canuck2fan,2007-08-23 16:53:00,1444,Some days this site is better than TV. Unless you want to take a course of rabies shots I would not advise going with the picking it up by the tail theory as mentioned above. My Grandfather who had a trap line swore that without their hind legs on the ground they can't spray but then he did say they can still whip around and infect you with one hell of a nasty bite.....
106684,Landlocked,2007-08-23 17:01:00,171,"Pam's recipe is the ticket if ingredients are on hand, if not Coca-Cola does help in a pinch...at least it did on my Golden Retriever late one Sunday night.    (was recommended by a vet for emergency situations, then followed up with that recipe next night)"
107913,ufish2,2007-08-27 13:43:00,15,"Hey everyone!!  Well didn't get a chance to post last week or the weekend but Mr. Skunk is now a free critter thanks to everyone here.    I used the tarp trick and didn't chance transporting him, just managed to open the door and slowly walk away.  After about 2 minutes he slowly walked out of the cage and was on his way.   Everything worked out okay, no harm done.  Sorry no pics guys.  Thanks to all for your help, This is a great site with great people!!!!!  P.S.  I will definetely keep the formula for skunk smell removal, because I have a very curious young LAB!!"
107925,jedimaster,2007-08-27 14:49:00,3472,I have to be completly honest here I was kind of hoping you would get sprayed.  Congrats.
107932,pikehunter,2007-08-27 15:13:00,1659," Ahhhhh...so what you are really telling us is that we will have to wait till the next time to find out if the skunk recipie works?  Really though, I'm happy to hear that the story had a happy ending."
107963,JohnF,2007-08-27 16:33:00,3494, I'm thinking I'd offer the most obnoxious kid in the neighbourhood five bucks to release it.  JohnF
107999,supernaut,2007-08-27 18:11:00,46,"A few winters ago my dad caught one in the cage, Dad grabbed a bucket of cold water and tossed it onto him. The next morning when he went out to check up on the little stinker he was frozen solid. To bad it's not winter eh!"
108158,pikehunter,2007-08-28 01:01:00,1659, Flash frozen Pepe Le Pew!! Too funny.
106117,ufish2,2007-08-22 13:01:00,15,"Hey everybody, we have a trap set up in our garden and been catching rabbits that are eating everything in sight.  We usually just bring them about 4 miles away and release them in an open field area.  But a SKUNK!!! how am I going to get him to the area to release him.  Does anyone have experience with skunks?  What are my options here? I don't want to hurt the skunk.  Please anybody have any suggestions?"
106120,motv8tr,2007-08-22 13:08:00,2587,"I hope you havea  pick up truck   Slowly walk to the cage with a white sheet or blanket held up, no sudden movements.  Slowly drape the sheet over the cage, gently pick it up and put it in the truck and you can move it up to a km away (if you're in ontario), take it off the truck, and release.  Good luck  Maureen"
106121,Roy,2007-08-22 13:09:00,13728,"The SPCA should be able to help you. Personally, I'd call P3TA and tell them that if they don't come over to get the skunk right now.....well, I'm sure you can think up some interesting consequences. There'll be  media coverage...wear your OFC hat."
106122,snag,2007-08-22 13:10:00,1932,Start filling your bathtub with Tomato juice
106124,redx,2007-08-22 13:18:00,60,"Feed it and keep it as a pet. They make a great pet, smart and they will not spray unless they have to or you can goto a vet and remove the stink gland."

106138,ccmtcanada,2007-08-22 14:12:00,7971,I'd call animal control and hopefully they could deal with it!!
106140,John,2007-08-22 14:15:00,2956, I was in the middle of my third coffee Roy! I will send you the cleaning bill...............
106154,BITEME,2007-08-22 14:35:00,1969,SUCKS TO BE YOU!!!!!! ADVICE....an arrow there better dead then they dont spray
106155,jedimaster,2007-08-22 14:43:00,3472,I was also going to say put an arrow through it in the upper half of its body. It will go through and through and it won't spray. I would say your almost certain to get sprayed. How hard is it to just open the trap and let it out? If you do try and move it. Make a suit out of garbage bags and wear a face mask. Don't forget to take pictures.
106157,rickster,2007-08-22 14:45:00,495,I've heard of people using stinkbait to catch fish but aren't you going a little above and beyond?
106158,Garyv,2007-08-22 14:46:00,547,"Send it via courier to headquarters here:  P3TA 501 Front St. Norfolk, VA 23510  Or do as Maureen said above.  If you take your time you shouldn't have any problems."

106160,highdrifter,2007-08-22 14:50:00,2534,"Hey ufish2,  What kinda cage is it?  If it's a have-a-heart, chances are its too low for the skunk to lift its tail.  They may stink up to high heaven, but if they're unable to lift their tails, you need not worry!  Maureen had a good point though.  In order to avoid giving the animal un-due stress, just place an old blanket over top of the cage when you transport it.  Let us know how the relocation went!!  cheers HD"
106161,davew3,2007-08-22 14:51:00,430,"As said  just move slow, cover the cage and be gentle.  use a pick up and take it away. Good luck."
106163,ccmtcanada,2007-08-22 14:54:00,7971,Did we mention we like pictures?  Video would be even better...be sure to have them handy whatever you decide!
106164,ufish2,2007-08-22 14:54:00,15,"  How can I take a chance? the concequences are drastic!!!!  What would i do if it did spray me??  what is the remedy, does tomato juice really do the trick?"
106166,ccmtcanada,2007-08-22 15:00:00,7971,Here's a link on how to release skunks from a cage....pretty much what Maureen said...  http://icwdm.org/wildlife/skunk/skunkrelease.asp

106173,OhioFisherman,2007-08-22 15:06:00,6623,"LOL yes pictures and report! especially the trash bag suit! a tie is not mandatory! Living in the country that has been about the only thing that scares me, walking outside and meeting the striped kitty."
106176,mpo,2007-08-22 15:10:00,6,"If you cover the fur ball up with a blanket they won't spray. Then you can take it out and get rid of it in the bush. We had to do that at my brothers house, he had a nest of them under his shed."
106178,kissmybass,2007-08-22 15:12:00,36,"hate any neighbours? if you do, that's one way to get back at them..."
106191,jedimaster,2007-08-22 15:30:00,3472,Put a dog collar and a leash on it and let it loose in the Eatons Center.
106192,jedimaster,2007-08-22 15:30:00,3472,coruier it to Andrew Raycroft......
106235,Wade,2007-08-22 18:01:00,9,"Been there, done that  -  but I didn't worry about transporting him anywhere!  I got a blue tarpaulin and walked slowly towards the cage, as I got closer he would turn around and lift his butt towards me then I'd back off - did this a couple of times.  Then ran in fast, throwing the tarp at him and covered the cage completely - he let off a couple of blasts into the tarp.  I left him alone for a minute then slowly lifted the cage door - not so easy - and out he ran - whew!  I think because the spray was so confined to the tarp that the smell wasn't as bad as it could've been - I had a dog that got sprayed once - bad! - & yeah tomato juice works!"
