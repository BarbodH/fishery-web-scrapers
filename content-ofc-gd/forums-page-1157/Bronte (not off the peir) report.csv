Most of the fish we marked were in the 70-80 feet.  Very little close in almost like a blank spot in the lake.  The water is really warm 68-69f.  Manged to take one little Salmon 5-6 pounds.  It had already started to turn for the river run.  After 7:30pm there were a few jumpers but nothing in numbers.  Thanks  LeXX"
