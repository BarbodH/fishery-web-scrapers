108017,Dozer,2007-08-27 18:54:00,896,"Okay, so most of us here love fish.  So I figured I'd ask everyone if they have aquariums?  Here,  I've got a 90 gallon tank in the basement, fresh water fish.  Currently stocked with Tony the Tiger, Carl the Clown and Cindy the Synodontis... New Guinea Tiger, Clown Knife, and Featherfin Synodontis, respectively.  No worries, Carl isn't there for life.  I also have an apprx. 1000 gallon Koi pond in the backyard along with three big Perch and some big minnows.  Has about 30 some odd Koi ranging from 6 inches to about 20 inches.  Show us or tell us about your stuff!  A photo of my tank can be found here...  http://www.monsterfishkeepers.com/gallery/...00/ppuser/17084  See ya!"
108020,Lakeshore,2007-08-27 19:02:00,56,"Have a 20 Gal tall tank, with assorted tropicals (danios, platys, corydoras, and a small pleco. I am also putting a second tank together for my four year old, with Electric Blue Lobsters (Australian blue crayfish) and a few goldfish/koi.  Being a fisherman and an aquarium enthusiast kind of go hand in hand."
108023,addy79,2007-08-27 19:09:00,573,"I've got a 90 gallon as well... I've had snakeheads, peacockbass, and africam cichlids in the past. But these predator fish caused me LOTS of problems, with maintenance and disease prevention.  Currently, im in the works to stock my tank with easier going community fish... tetras etc. i cant wait to see how it looks with them all swimming around in their respective schools, i've been told that a 90 gallon tank can hold WELL over 100 tetras.  when its all done, i'll post a pic of the finished product"
