Just got back from our annual trip to the ZEC .. not a banner year if measured in inches or pounds ... but certainly a trip laden with stories to be told around the campfire ... which depending on where you grew up is worth much more    Anyhow ... lets just start with a little 8 hour delay on the way in to camp ...due to an EXPLOSIVE double flat on the Lincoln Navigator 4X4 ... only a few Km into the ZEC but almost an hours drive from any form of civilization .... the whole story will take more time than my tired eyes have to write .. but suffice it to say that Murphy was working overtime .... anyhow .. as I kept reminding my (VERY good sport of a ) daughter .. its the journey .. not the destination that defines LIVING..... and a great (even if too short) weekend was had by all ...
