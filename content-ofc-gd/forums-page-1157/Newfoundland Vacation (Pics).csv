107568,Basskicker,2007-08-25 20:05:00,421,"Well I just got back from the 'Rock'.....spent 2 weeks there. Simply amazing....I forgot how beautiful this place was.  My sister got married so it was pretty hectic the first 5 days. After all the chaos of the wedding my fiancee and myself left for the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland for some sight seeing.  The scenery is absolutely breath taking....the pictures don't do any justice.  Newfoundland scenery is so diverse depending on which part of the Rock you visit.  There are so many moose in Newfoundland that it's dangerous to be driving at night.    The first night away we stayed at a beautiful lodge at Big Falls (salmon river)  Unfortunately you need a guide to fish the salmon rivers in Newfoundland (very costly) so I didn't do any salmon fishing, but we saw several fish jumping at the falls....pretty cool.   The second night we stayed at a small B&B in Rocky Harbour and went to the hotel for some Newfoundland entertainment and music. Some more beautiful scenery along the way.      The next morning we went on a boat tour for 2 1/2 hours into an inland fjord. Definately the highlite of our trip.            I took 291 pictures of our trip.....so I don't want to bore you with so many, but here some pics from the rest of our trip.  These are from the Grand Lake area....my old stomping grounds.  I wanted to show my fiancee some of the back country that are not in the tourist guide books            I have so many pics.....but that's enough.  If you ever have the opportunity to visit the Rock....go for it...you won't be disappointed.  Jason"

You folks have some extremely beautiful country up there.  You ain't gonna bore us with more pics ... would love to see PART 2, PART 3, etc."

107710,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-26 12:16:00,0,Canada sure has some scenic coastline! I think the newfies should consider eating some moose with their fish and chips.  Thanks for posting!
107722,Fish Farmer,2007-08-26 13:05:00,2234,"Thanks for posting and taking us for a tour. Thats one place I'd love to go. Did you fly, or take the ferry across? I've heard the ferry is an experience also. You wouldn't want to meet nicer people."
107762,BLACKFISH88,2007-08-26 18:11:00,191,Nice pictures thar bai!!!

107861,Dano,2007-08-27 09:53:00,719,"The place looks amazing, great pics! I am supposed to go next summer for a couple of weeks, can hardly wait!"
107894,Basskicker,2007-08-27 12:20:00,421,"Hey Sinker, I only made it up as far as Daniels Harbour.....planned on sneaking into one of the brookie ponds I once visited as a kid, but unfortunately I didn't have the time and the weather was simply horrible.  It rained every day for the last 8 days I was there.....there's a old saying 'If you don't like the weather, wait 10 minutes, It'll change'  Fish Farmer, actually I flew down (direct flight) into my home town Stephenville and rented a vehicle.  It's cheaper to fly then drive during the summer months.....but then you miss out on the ferry.  Quite an experience when the seas get rough.  And yes, the hospitality of Newfoundlander's is unbeatable!!!  Jason"
