107927,mikeymikey,2007-08-27 14:55:00,376,I believe it's Tuesday.??? ot 100%  I really do wonder how the fishes will react.  mayeb i'll hook into salmon from pier non-stop
107930,jedimaster,2007-08-27 15:10:00,3472,"Tuesday Morning from what I know. like 5 am or something.  Supposedly the theory is that when an eclipse happens on a clear night Walleye go bananas because the preasure should say clear skies and go eat everything in sight, but it is darker out so they get all freaked out.  I dunno, sounds  bit fishy, but I may go early am and try and hit a few.   Basically tonight is the eclipse the it will run from 4:51am to 8:24am Tuesday morning."
