I searched the web, there doesnt seem to be any aftermarket motors either but looking at the motor you would swear its just a windsheild wiper motor  Thanks, Johnny"
107528,PERCHER,2007-08-25 17:04:00,787,You could try anyone who rebuilds starters or alternators or any electric motor rebilders.
107550,Tybo,2007-08-25 18:50:00,1373,Might be better to buy a new one.  Give UAP or traction a call with the serial number.
107551,Garyv,2007-08-25 18:57:00,547,Try going to Walker direct...they used to sell parts direct plus you eliminate the middle man if they still do.  Tell Randy Ford  ( owner ) that Darryl Cronzy sent you!!!!!  Another place to trry is North Bay Distributors ( in North Bay ) they stock most rigger parts and can ship overnight.
