107978,wuchikubo,2007-08-27 17:21:00,1114,"That's a whale shark, no human remains inside, just organs that look like human legs at that angle. The newspaper is trying to divert attention away from they troubles.  Plus the whale shark, as pointed out on comments below is on the endangered species list and shouldn't have been cut up for food like that.  Stan"
107979,Mike Pike,2007-08-27 17:21:00,1332,Looks like a whale shark to me( plankton eater )as well as a little National Enquirer-like reporting.
107982,Greencoachdog,2007-08-27 17:28:00,8163,"Yeah, when I first saw the pic. I thought Whale Shark, and a fairly small one at that!"
107983,Roy,2007-08-27 17:31:00,13728,Looks like a baby whale shark.
108011,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-27 18:37:00,2585,Bull story  cheers!
108014,Dozer,2007-08-27 18:40:00,896,"Nonsense, not a cat... like everyone else says, its a whale shark, and a small one for that matter.  Plus, it doesn't eat humans."
108016,Gerritt,2007-08-27 18:51:00,6129,Just goes to show you.... dont believe everything that you read I suppose....   G.
108127,ecxstriper,2007-08-27 23:10:00,343,Well if it is on the internet it has to be true!!!!
108139,mikeymikey,2007-08-28 00:15:00,376,... and the meat was sold on the market.
108144,Roy,2007-08-28 00:22:00,13728,"But  reading the subject line, I was sure it was a picture of a giant man eating a catfish."
108146,Muskieman,2007-08-28 00:30:00,2472,Can't clean that with a fork and a pair of pliars....Imagine if were really a Cat...?
108154,Rizzo,2007-08-28 00:55:00,4754,"no doubt about it, thats one of the whale sharks from the movie jackdonkey where they fill the guys swim trunks with shrimp and then fire him in front of some feeding whale sharks"
108156,danbouck,2007-08-28 01:00:00,4380, That is exactly what I thought!
108170,Rizzo,2007-08-28 01:46:00,4754," that is certainly not what I wrote...but as far as censorship goes, that's pretty funny (also sad, because a jacka$s is just the name of an animal so why bleep it out...unless of course its the reference to a movie title that lead to its bleeping...now I'm so confused I feel like a jackdonkey for starting this)"
108175,glen,2007-08-28 01:51:00,2641,What
108177,glen,2007-08-28 01:54:00,2641,Is jackdonkey a bad word?
108179,Gerritt,2007-08-28 01:56:00,6129,seems as though they have updated the story since I first saw it.... people have been calling in stating it is indeed a whale shark.... sad indeed....  Glen why am I a jackass?  Gerritt.
