107875,Smokey,2007-08-27 11:13:00,1278,"I'm just heading out this morning to get my weekend report. I never hit the water on weekends if I can avoid it, so hopefully this evening."

107893,Bly,2007-08-27 12:14:00,1556,"Sorry Roy, there was no fishing for me this past weekend.  Spent the weekend driving to and from Michigan to pick up my daughter and then there was the last minute unplanned trip to Gander Mountain to buy replacements for some of my fishing equipment that was stolen while I was away.  Difficult to fish when the little turds get your rods and reels."
