108060,fatherof3,2007-08-27 20:33:00,1769,"we have been out a few times lately with not much being caught.With construction going on at our favorite spot I figured we should use the time to explore new places. Have caught a bunch of bass around the same size as this one.  We have found a lot of new spots that look very good and met some fellow fishermen who were willing to share where to go.Anyway, just thought I would share some scenery pics from along the Grand. It really is quite a nice area.Hopefully will have some fish pics soon.      "

108102,danbouck,2007-08-27 22:03:00,4380,Decided to stop in Glen Morris today to check out the river and the water seems a lot higher. That's good news for bass fishin!
108104,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-27 22:16:00,698,With Scenery like that it doesn't really matter if the fishing is slow or not
108105,Roy,2007-08-27 22:19:00,13728,Man. that bass looks pretty white. I've never fished the Grand but it looks like a great river to wade down. Must be some nice holes in there. Thanks for the report and pics.
108128,tbayboy,2007-08-27 23:21:00,1497,"Great pics.  It really is a beautiful river, the conservation guys are doing a good job.  I went there Saturday afternoon to try out my new waders.  The waders worked great but unfortunately I left the rain jacket in the car and sure enough the 'light rains' they called for turned into a huge dumping before I could get into any fish but like Toronto Angler said - its such a nice place you don't feel too bad when you don't get any fish."
