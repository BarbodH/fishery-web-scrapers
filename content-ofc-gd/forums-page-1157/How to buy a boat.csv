107949,lookinforwalleye,2007-08-27 15:50:00,4399, I have a Alumacraft and love it.
107976,Uncle Buck,2007-08-27 17:18:00,1000,"don't be afraid of older motors...  i've got a 1975 merc 150HP outboard that has served me well and will be mounted on my boat once i finish it...  like everything though do your homework... the only motors i would honestly stay away from are Chryslers and Force motors... note that all force motors are NOT mercurys... some are chryslers...  if purchasing new, when i was down in Florida @ christmas, 90% of all motors rigged onto boats were Yamaha 4 strokes and Mercury Verados"
107422,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 03:31:00,3421,Stuntman it depends on your budget.I have a Lund but its not fancy.Its a bare bones Aluminium 18.5ft with a 50 Honda 4 stroke with power trim and flat floor inserts.I bought a demo model almost new from the dealer low payments.I can tell you this boat is built solid you don't have to pay alot to own a Lund.It depends on what you want.I will add the live well and binimi top later.  Good Luck with your purchase.  MTP
107427,Greencoachdog,2007-08-25 03:48:00,8163,  ... and here's your hat Mr. Loser... er.... uh... I mean Mr. Lund owner. 
107496,stuntman,2007-08-25 14:09:00,96,"I am not wearing a hat with a big ""L"" on it lol.  ""pay a lot"" is a relative term, so I guess I will have to feel that out on my own  Thanks for the input guys.  Stutnman"
107498,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 14:44:00,3421,  Glen the guy who designed that hat should be fired.If your real nice you may be allowed to fish in one of our Lunds In Quinte thats if you can handle the mild weather  Its time to catch a big Wall-Ice In November.
107553,stuntman,2007-08-25 19:31:00,96,the boat deals don't make it so easy to compare.  I did come across a v14 (or was it a t14v?): http://www.alumacraft.com/utility_main.html do they have a good rep?  stuntman
107562,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 19:51:00,3421,Stuntman try and buy a 16 foot boat or more believe me when it gets rough you will want the comfort and security of 16ft or more.If you buy a 14ft you will end up changing later.  Mike
107567,Larry,2007-08-25 20:05:00,32,It seems to me that I heard they are going to do away with 2-stroke engines sometime in the future. Has anybody heard this also??
107572,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 20:15:00,3421, TS I have been hearing this for 10 years.Now that Bombardier makes the new Evinrude E-Tech 2 stroke which has low emissions I woudn't count on it.I have heard alot of great things about these E-Techs.  Time will tell.  MTP
107574,stuntman,2007-08-25 20:29:00,96,"Old style 2-strokes are out, new DFI 2-strokes are in.  Environmental based law changes (primarily in the US) are pushing the change along.  Here is one of the links I found: http://www.smartsynthetics.com/articles/fu...boardmotors.htm  Stuntman"
107638,pikehunter,2007-08-26 00:00:00,1659," Yep, nothing wrong with that. Actually all the basic tinnys are good these days. Remember rows of rivets (double is better) beam and depth are important factors. Once you start looking around you will find that some have a split tiller seat which is a nice feature as it gives you some room to move around.  Also if you are considering a 14' get a price on the same model in a 16'.  Should only be a couple of hundred dollars more and there is more room and you will also gain because of the higher weight capacity the 16 offers.  Lund, Lowe, Alumacraft, Crestliner, PolarKraft, Starcraft, Smokercraft are all good brands. Compare prices, features, what is included in the price and what the hidden charges are and the dealers attitude is important.  Evinrude motors are E-Tech if over 40 hp. 40 and under are Johnsons and available in a 4 stroke which is a Suzuki painted white . Johnsons 2 Strokes could still be available in the under 40.  Nissan outboards are at the bottom end of the price structure and the smaller Mercurys are made by Nissan (Well at least they were a couple of years ago.)"
