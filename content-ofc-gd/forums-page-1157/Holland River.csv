108052,issamhay,2007-08-27 20:10:00,77,then what river could it be?
108053,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-27 20:10:00,2585,the holland river is the river on the south end of cooks bay.  So no that is not the holland river.  Cheers!
108056,issamhay,2007-08-27 20:15:00,77,yes but ive been looking all over the place and i cant seem to find what the river is called and if it has any fish in it.
108062,Terry,2007-08-27 20:37:00,14456,well I am not sure but wouldn't that one be lovers creek..
108137,SlowPoke,2007-08-28 00:01:00,2984,Lovers creek? That sounds like an irritation like jock itch.
108157,Rizzo,2007-08-28 01:00:00,4754,"Ok, so its not the Holland River, but what's in a name? Go wet a line and see what you find (oh yes, and tell us if you figure out the name).!"
