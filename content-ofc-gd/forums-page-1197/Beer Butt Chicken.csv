82615,Daplumma,2007-06-11 23:14:00,1961,"I've been making these for more than a couple of years and with summer getting into full swing I thought I'd make some tonite.I like to inject myine with your favorite marinade,these are small 3.25 lb birds but I like to really fill them up in the breast and thighs.  Next I take a tall boy beer and open up the lid a bit and pour out about 1/3 of the beer and reserve for later consuption by the chef.Take a couple tablespoons of minced garlic and put it in the beer can.careful ..it may bubble over!  I then rub the chicken with olive oil and chicken rub.You can use store bought or any combination of salt,pepper,paprika,greek seasoning ect..slide the chicken over the can like this.  Cover the grill with foil and cut a hole where the chicken can will go.You need a tall grill to do this.Indirect heat is key..  Put them on the grill at med high and cook untill the breast is about 17 or so.I always feel a bit guilty cooking these in front of the girls.  These took about and hour at temps between 450 and 550.Dig in!  I'm off to eat now!! Joe"

82651,Nanook,2007-06-12 01:28:00,565,"Lol!! We will be passing thro' Viginny in a few weeks time,and if we smell that cooking, I'm gonna be sorely tempted to veer off for a visit. Looks sumptious....slurp !"
82653,Daplumma,2007-06-12 01:30:00,1961,"You know you are welcome here Jack,let me know. Joe"
82698,ehg,2007-06-12 02:42:00,2666,"Hey, that's what i had for dinner tonite!  The ones i had were cooked by a Canadian dude Ted Reader and was referred to as ' tall boy' chicken, since he used 'tall boy' cans of Canadien beer and hickory smoked the chickens on the barbeque. Had cedar planked bay scallops wrapped in bacon as well, and cedar planked barbeque mashed potatoes that were pre- cooked 'ice cream scooped' onto the planks then crusted on the Q. All leftovers from a large function i worked as chef at, luckily i have control of leftover food so got some home.  great stuff, yum-yum  ehg"
82721,Greencoachdog,2007-06-12 03:46:00,8163,"Well ain't you just the ""Martha Stewart"" kinda girlie guy!!!  We refer to that as ""Drunken chicken"" down here in Alabanana, and yes... it is ""melt in your mouth"" gooooooood!!!"
82727,ch312,2007-06-12 04:21:00,1590,"i got a chicken from a barn almost 2 weeks ago and chopped its head off in my backyard and skinned it cuz i didnt feel like plucking. BBQ'd and it was the juiciest, best tasting chicken ive ever had. now thats FRESH  i didnt even bother injecting this one but it really didnt need it anyways."
82782,Headhunter,2007-06-12 13:18:00,5703,"A great tried and true recipe! I use my roasting pan instead of tin foil, makes it easier to remove the birds from the grill when their done. Also, just a tip, but ensure that you use a liquid, what ever it is in the can at room temperature. Taking a cold beer out of the fridge and using it will slow the cooking process and reduce the amount of moisture transfered to the bird! HH"
84336,blue pickeral,2007-06-16 01:02:00,267,"Sorry to bring back an old post....would like to replicate this recipe exactly and unsure of what the '17' stands for in the recipe?   Many thanks for the pictures and directions...heard about chicken done this way, but until now couldn't visualize how to do it!"
84343,Daplumma,2007-06-16 01:24:00,1961,Sorry typo there..170F..Thats aboot 300 litres Canadian.Best of luck the best chicken you ever ate is awaiting you. Joe
84347,Daplumma,2007-06-16 01:34:00,1961,Just a note.You can do Cornish game hens the same way.Just use a tomato paste can instead of a beer and the good news is it more beer for the chef!You got to try it sometime.. Joe
84350,blue pickeral,2007-06-16 01:39:00,267,"Thanks Joe! Looking forward to it!   In our little northern Ontario school, it was hogsheads and leagues, until the government decided everyone should go metric....you can understand my confusion."
84368,Daplumma,2007-06-16 02:49:00,1961,"No worries,We were gonna go metric all thru grade school and then the big day came and we said...nope..thtas too hard so here we are a non metric island.I am equaly confused with miles and gallons. Joe"
84415,nofrills,2007-06-16 11:35:00,89,"As the head chef, and head beer drinker of my household, I thought I'd pass along a couple things I've learned over the years making this... 1. Use an old pie plate underneath to catch drippings. 2. You can buy devices from Bass Pro, and CTC designed to hold the can, and the chicken that will prevent tipping over. 3. Try other liquids. White wine, Coke, rootbeer. I find ginger beer works fantastic, as does Sprite or 7 Up. 4. Leave the bird be! Don't poke it, don't move it, don't touch it. If you break the skin, you'll loose a lot of the juice. Keep an eye on the heat, and let the grill do the work for you!"
84466,Carmen,2007-06-16 16:47:00,72,"Never tried before but on my list of BBQ projects for this summer, Thanx for the tips"
