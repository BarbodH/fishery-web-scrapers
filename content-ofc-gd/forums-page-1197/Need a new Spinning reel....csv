83834,addy79,2007-06-14 18:25:00,573,Thanks Tony!
83838,Canuck2fan,2007-06-14 18:34:00,1444," Oh it was a tough go with that fella.... what he lacked in size and strength he made up with cunning and determination. In all seriousness though on the Pflueger I landed about 22 salmon and rainbow, one carp about 15lbs, many many bass, perch and of course let us not over look a ton of the worlds greatest sport fish the mighty rock bass (at least 20 which went well over 12 inches long so you can see how tough they would have been to land BBR would have been proud I think.  I was going to go for a Diawa but when I tried the pflueger I just lost all interest in the other reels. Before that I was a shimano guy too, I still collect Shimano mark reels but as for fishing it with them it is really like grinding metal retrieving them in comparison. BTW I went steelheading at least 2 times a week for about 6 hrs average from September 2nd 2006, to June 6th 2007 missing only 3 weeks when all the legal areas were frozen solid and the pflueger never let me down!!! As for maintenance I oiled twice once in October and once before opening week it is still as smooth as when I took it out of the box."
83871,wallyboss,2007-06-14 19:26:00,1095,If you want a very good price to quality ratio try an Okuma.
83874,tonyb,2007-06-14 19:30:00,1637,
83921,rickster,2007-06-14 21:52:00,495,pflueger or okuma Have both and are great reels
83927,Greencoachdog,2007-06-14 22:27:00,8163,  Day'um... I wouldn't slam an outhouse door that hard!!!
83928,mepps,2007-06-14 22:31:00,1301,Quantum PTi is my top choice
83937,Moosebunk,2007-06-14 22:52:00,3970,"Okuma Epixor has really disappointed me.  Lasted 1 week trib fishing nooks then quickly fell apart.  Shimano Symmetre has really impressed me.  Fish everything big with this, including using it on the ice.  Always smooth and durable too.  Quantum PTi is so far fantastic.  Have an ultralight and no complaints.  Abu C3 (new reel, old design) is so far disappointing me.  Any tension on the line seems to make it harder to reel.  Excluding the tension of a fish tugging.  All these reels are around $100 give or take."
84033,NANUK,2007-06-15 03:20:00,797," I had the same experience with Okuma Epixor, a couple of trips to the tribs, a few bows and the reel sounds like a coffee grinder, sent it for warranty repairs, came back ok, first outing and the grinding sound is back,   paid $100 for it and very disappointed. have a 12 year old Daiwa Regal, and I have caught everything including big 20+ lbs salmon on it, still as smooth as the day I bought it."
84087,taper,2007-06-15 10:14:00,611,If you like rear drag and quick cast the Shimano Solstice is a decent reel for about $70.
84106,bigbuck,2007-06-15 11:23:00,2449,"I think BassPro still has the Shimano Stradics on for about $125 (the 2500 size). Otherwise, a Quantum, Daiwa, Shimano Sahara (I've got 2) are all good. Once you get to that price point, most of the reels are reely (pardon the pun) good. You should get many years of faithful service out of it."
84162,Fishnfiend,2007-06-15 14:46:00,357, Ditto.
84163,glen,2007-06-15 15:01:00,2641,Go for the Shimano Sahara about $83 at Le Barons.   Just got one for my buddy.  Ordered online took five days to get here.  I have two and i like them better then the Diawa's i have.
84166,gregger27,2007-06-15 15:03:00,14,All the reels mentioned in this post are great reels! You can't go wrong with any of them.  My personal favourite is the Stradic!
84168,tonyb,2007-06-15 15:08:00,1637, These are $150.00 U.S. but a sweet reel!  
84187,ADC,2007-06-15 16:17:00,82,I have the Shimano Solstace w/rear drag and trigger.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...t=SearchResults   I couldnt be happier for the $$.  It has great reviews.  Combined with my Shimano Compre rod its perfect.   cheers
84213,addy79,2007-06-15 17:17:00,573,"Thanks for all the information guys, I'll get back to you when i buy one!"
83769,addy79,2007-06-14 16:52:00,573,"Hey guys, I'm in desperate need of a new fishing reel. The Shimano Stradic caught my eye right away, but its REALLY expensive! I don't mind spending around $100 for a reel, but $160 is a little excessive for me. Does anyone have any suggestions for a good quality reel no more than $100MAX? I've always prefered Shimano reels, but won't discriminate. Thanks."
83773,Raf,2007-06-14 17:01:00,3495,Daiwa are my #1 choice for spinning reels.  Just find the model in your price range.  They've a few that will suit your needs.
83774,bassman,2007-06-14 17:02:00,384,Daiwa or Abu Garcia.
83775,addy79,2007-06-14 17:05:00,573,everyone always seems to point me towards Diawa's?!? Are they that good?? To be honest I've never really strayed from Shimano's
83777,ecmilley,2007-06-14 17:10:00,2163,"diawa, abu or shimano are all excellant products and you really can't go wrong with any of them, i prefer shimano, and for the C note area look at a sarhara"
83778,motv8tr,2007-06-14 17:12:00,2587,"I have a Shimano Sahara that I really like, don't know what it's worth money wise as it was a gift.  Maureen"
83779,Raf,2007-06-14 17:14:00,3495,"yep, you really can';t go wrong with any of them  http://www.tackletour.com/menuarchive.html has some head-to-head comparisons; shimano vs daiwa to confuse you some more.  i find daiwa spinning reels have the best drags.  that is just me.  you might be able to get a capricorn or laguna around that price if you shop around."
83782,douG,2007-06-14 17:18:00,2693,Raf is right on the money.  You can't beat Daiwa for value.
83784,Fang,2007-06-14 17:27:00,1330,Daiwa SS 1300 can usually be picked up for right around $99 nowadays. I've had mine for almost 10 years - never let me down  If BPS has any more of last years Pro Qualifiers left (PQS1500 or 2000's) they were being sold off at $69 each. Very nice reel for the price.
83787,lew,2007-06-14 17:36:00,12767,"I've had a Shimano Sahara for a few years that I use for springtime pickeral and have been very happy with it, and it should fall right in your budget."
83788,Roy,2007-06-14 17:36:00,13728,You're getting solid advice there Adam except for what Doug says. Doug knows nothing about spinning reels.  Good luck in your search.
83795,douG,2007-06-14 17:41:00,2693,"JB's has the Daiwa Theory for $109.  If you ask, Steve or Brian might spool it for you with XL or P Line fluoro for free.  Adam, just to clarify Roy's comment(s), that was really a poorly disguised compliment."
83798,Raf,2007-06-14 17:42:00,3495,thanks Roy!
83800,Roy,2007-06-14 17:45:00,13728,Doug thinks so much of his Daiwa Theory that he left it at my place for a year. I didn't use it either.
83803,Headhunter,2007-06-14 17:50:00,5703,"That blows that ""Theory"" right outta the water! HH"
83805,solopaddler,2007-06-14 17:53:00,8605,Shipped to your door in less than week.....  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true  OR  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true  OR  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true
83807,Canuck2fan,2007-06-14 17:54:00,1444,For a hundred bucks don't overlook the Pflueger Specialist BPS has them at 99.99 and for the money you won't find a smoother reel. I haven't got one of them yet but I do have the reel it replaced from last year the medalist it has been one very tough reel so far. I was at BPS on Saturday and if you try the Pflueger for feel against any 100.00 dollar Diawa or Shimano either of those others WILL feel like you are grinding silverware in your sink disposal in comparision to how smooth and true the Pflueger retrieves.
83810,addy79,2007-06-14 17:59:00,573,"So  Canuck, was the Pflueger able to handle that monster in your avatar with little trouble??!??"
83812,addy79,2007-06-14 18:01:00,573,AWESOME website!! thanks for the info!
83815,tonyb,2007-06-14 18:03:00,1637,If you can cough up $18.43 on top of your budget you can buy a Shimano Stradic 2500 or Team Daiwa Advantage 2000 from Cabelas.  Both quality reels.  $118.43 delivered to your doorstep (Shipping and U.S. exchange rate included in that price)  Team Daiwa Advantage 2000   Shimano Stradic 2500    Either that or go for the Shimano Sahara about $83 at Le Barons.
83818,addy79,2007-06-14 18:08:00,573, are these american prices??
83819,douG,2007-06-14 18:08:00,2693,"For further clarification, that Theory was inadvertently left behind at Lakair last year, and despite many requests for shipment, I had to actually meet Roy in Picton to receive it."
83821,tbayboy,2007-06-14 18:09:00,1497,"I picked up the Sahara this year (facing the same decision as you vs the Stradic) and have been very happy with it, great real for a nice price.  The recommendations about Cabelas are dead on as well - given the current dollar rate its definitely worth looking south of the border if you want to save a bit."
83822,addy79,2007-06-14 18:10:00,573,WOW! Cabela's has some good prices!! if the shipping and exchange are included in that price than its sold!
83824,FishHeadRic,2007-06-14 18:12:00,226,For that price you should be able to pick up a Quantam Catalyst as well. I bought one the first year they came out and have been very happy with it.  FHR
