The wallies were hot hot hot, fished mostly no more than three to four miles out between middle bass and kellys islands. I felt like we turned the clock back to the 1980s with the average fish in the two to three pound rangs with a dozen or so weighing in at 4 plus pounds and 4 at six pounds or better the largest weighing 8lb. 12 oz and was 28"" Pics to follow. almost all were taken on bottom bouncers and 36"" harness's with either gold hammered or purple and gold blades . with trolling speed at 1.7 mph. P.S. for some strange reason it looks like a fish fry for fathers day. good luck to all"
