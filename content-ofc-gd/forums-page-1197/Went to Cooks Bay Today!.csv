Picture of the northbound lane:   I was stuck on the 400 for 3 hours before they opened on lane, during my 3 hours of waiting i fell asleep in my car to wake up to moving traffic so i got up and adjusted my seat and bang the adjustment handle broke off and my seat is basically free swinging on me all the way home  ."
