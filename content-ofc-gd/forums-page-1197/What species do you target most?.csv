83962,Rich Clemens,2007-06-14 23:55:00,3131,It really depends on the trip  1).  July - Bass 2).  September - Pike and Musky  Lakair .... depends on the boat and who's in it I suppose.
83976,fishdawg,2007-06-15 00:52:00,912,"I fish nearly once a week all year for whatevers around.... the last couple of seasons my focus has mainly been  trolling the Great Lakes for salmon, trout & walleyes - though I do still make the odd venture to our place in the kawarthas for bass/muskie/eyes  i do enjoy a good feed of perch too as well throughout the callander as well"

83993,danbo,2007-06-15 01:43:00,2646,"Bass,musky,bows,pike."
84009,Tdel,2007-06-15 02:03:00,393,"The last few years I have fished mainly for Walleye, but I am no fanatic about it.  At my age I don't feel that I have to prove anything to anyone, including my fishing buddy.  All the rest like Pike, Bass, and Perch are usually incidental catches when I am out for walleye, although I do target them once in a while.  Occasionally I fish for Crappie(when available), Channel Cat, Mud Cat, and Trout.  I am usually very easy to satisfy.  I enjoy catching whatever is biting at the time and if they don't bite .............. That is ok too, I just enjoy being out there and relaxing.  Tom"

84077,OhioFisherman,2007-06-15 09:23:00,6623,"Haven`t fished much lately but for the last 40 years bass was and is Number 1, always a challenge to try and stay up with the best methods and tactics. LOL what goes around comes around, with a new name.  For me it depended on where and why, a lot of my trips were practice for tournaments, first look at new lakes, refreshers for old ones.  Trips north the game plan changed, pike, muskie(they won) bass, walleye, fun fishing no particular purpose other than to see what I could catch and to get the wife and kids some fish, enjoy the scenery and learn.  1. Bass, smallies, largemouth, I don`t care some waters have both some don`t.  2. Pike or skis, just because my choice of travel would be north.  3. Steelhead? not the plan, the alternative, bass fishing has to be bad, or is it me?  4.Walleye! I like throwing them back and listening to the whining! Breakout the Spam!  5. Anything that is a challenge that interests me, that doesn`t involve dragging lures behind a boat on wide open expanses of water. Water has to be fresh!"
84108,Blake,2007-06-15 11:27:00,418,1 big bass 2 slop bass 3 open water bass 4 dock bass  Did I mention that I love bass fishing????

84138,Hookset,2007-06-15 12:57:00,367,"Late November to the end of June it's Walleye, Pike and Lakers. After Bass Season opens thats about all I fish for. I almost feel like if I fish for something else during Bass Season, that I am missing out lol. Fave is Smallies, then Largies. Or was that Largies then Smallies ?....  Hookset."

83840,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-14 18:42:00,655,"For some reason, the poll option didn't work?"
83843,charlied,2007-06-14 18:47:00,584,steelhead and bass!
83844,misfish,2007-06-14 18:47:00,29133,My answer is as follows  1 Bass 2 pike 3 white fish 4 Lakers 5 perch and crappies 6 What ever else will bite my baits.  LOL  I had trouble with the poll thing too.Too complicated for us common folk.LOL
83845,misfish,2007-06-14 18:48:00,29133,I forgot about salmon and bows.LOL
83846,lew,2007-06-14 18:50:00,12767,Pickeral in May and then nothing but muskies from early June till mid-December
83849,ccmtcanada,2007-06-14 18:51:00,7971,I fish exclusively from shore so what I target depends on what's close!!!  1)  Early Spring and Fall - Steelhead 2)  Late Spring and Summer - Carp 3)  Fall - Walleye
83850,Raf,2007-06-14 18:53:00,3495,"June-Dec muskie  rest of year, anything that swims. lakers & pike are at the top of the list."
83853,RobHall,2007-06-14 18:58:00,261,"Half my fishing hours are spent looking for that elusive Muskie.  Having the Ottawa & Rideau Rivers within a few minutes drives has it's advantages.      The other half is divided between eye's, Pike, Bass, Panfish and sometimes Lake trout.  Carp and Salmon are on my to do list.  FOTB "
83856,misfish,2007-06-14 19:01:00,29133, Lew mid December?????????? Theres got to be ice somewhere around to try that ice fishing thing.LOL  Best of luck to you this season bud.
83859,jeffw,2007-06-14 19:04:00,267,"In the winter I target trout and whitefish, in the spring crappie and trout, late spring walleye and summer to fall muskies then bass the salmon. Cheers Jeff"
83861,motv8tr,2007-06-14 19:06:00,2587,"Bass mostly, but that's because those I fish with prefer that.  Honestly, I haven't caught many fish and not many species.  I hope to fish for as many different species this year as I can, then I might be able to tell you  , I even changed my work schedule so that I'm off Sundays in hopes that someone will take pity on me and invite me out fishing with them    .  Right now it's for whatever is in season and will take my offerings.  Maureen"
83864,bowshep,2007-06-14 19:14:00,378,River Trout and then the Other Fish

83869,Mattitude,2007-06-14 19:22:00,155,1. Smallmouth Bass 2. Largemouth Bass Simple reason is I find these ones to have the most fun factor.
83876,tonyb,2007-06-14 19:31:00,1637,Humans...preferrably female ones
83878,fishnsled,2007-06-14 19:38:00,3520,"It varies with the time of year.  Early winter Perch, Winter -walleye,  lakers and whitefish, Late winter/early spring- perch, crappies, steelhead, Spring - walleye and pike, Late spring/early summer - muskies, Summer - bass and walleye, Late summer/early fall - bass, walleye and muskie Fall - muskie Late fall (after the Kawarthas close down) - walleye  Then it starts all over again."
83881,spanky,2007-06-14 19:44:00,195,Bass steelhead pike-  tho i never catch any catfish crappie
83890,solopaddler,2007-06-14 20:31:00,8605,"I target everything... Top 4 in no particular order would be steelhead, brook trout, walleye and pike."
83896,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-14 20:46:00,655,"Thanks everyone.  I am going to ask Rick to help me figure out how to post a poll for this topic     Hopefully I can figure out how to get this poll up soon.  Silvio, thanks for the compliment.  Actually TonyB and I filmed an episode for our 2008 series on centerpin steelhead in the tribs in High Definition.. unfortunately, it will only air in standard definition.  There are lots of bright chrome acrobatic steelies going ballistic  Good fishing!  Aaron"
83905,solopaddler,2007-06-14 21:02:00,8605," So....you like to target humans, preferably females?  Sounds a little Hannibal Lecterish!"

83933,Greencoachdog,2007-06-14 22:39:00,8163,I like to target Fish!... preferably the live kind!
83935,Greencoachdog,2007-06-14 22:44:00,8163, Man!!!  How many times have I heard that statement come from a womans lips?
83938,Moosebunk,2007-06-14 22:53:00,3970,Pike and eyes.  No real choice otherwise.
