83995,mason05,2007-06-15 01:46:00,258,Headed out to my local pike hole tonight with a couple of friends.  Tried a few different areas floating shiners and eventually I hooked into this little guy.    The bite was a bit slow and the sun was dropping fast.  We decided to call it a night and head off.  Nice being out tonight as she was a beauty.    Will be heading out Sunday morning to try again with my father.  Hope we get into some.  Corn Nug

84039,Badger Shark,2007-06-15 03:31:00,291,"I see a common thread about the first thing noticed as that is what I saw first.  Nice pic and beautiful sunset.  Kinda like a car wreck, your eyes are just drawn to it."
