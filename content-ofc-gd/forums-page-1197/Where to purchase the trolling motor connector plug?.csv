84612,SlowPoke,2007-06-17 05:30:00,2984,West Marine should have them. I was in Hully Gully in London and they carry them... somewhere in the $30 range for the boat side. -Brian

84648,TAH,2007-06-17 14:22:00,133,Aikmans in Mississauga will have them or any Marine dealer could order one for you.
84655,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-17 14:40:00,1351,wow.. $30? i was thinking it'd be $10-15.. for that little peice of thing eh.. i guess i'd gotta call around.. i'm guessing west marine is my best choice or even eastern marine systems (closest to my house)
