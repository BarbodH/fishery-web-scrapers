Sadly I cant make it this year... only so much vacation & theres lotsa of other waters I want to explore  however I have yet to use to my free weekend up there that Kevin & Leslie donated to the draw last year, so a return trip is still on the horizon. Heres some random photos from last years trip. Keep the fire going & the drinks cold my friends... enjoy & be safe.                Roger (Rizzo) had to leave early - TJ wouldnt allow it!  lol "
