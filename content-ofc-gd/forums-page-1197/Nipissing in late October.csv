83306,NDangler,2007-06-13 16:44:00,6,Hey I was wondering if anyone has fished Nipissing in late October. The only week I have available to go is the 20th through the 28th. I know it probably depends a lot on the weather at that time of year but any advice or past experiences on how the fishing is at that time of year would be great. Thanks!
83325,Roy,2007-06-13 17:05:00,13728,Welcome aboard. Can't help with your question but someone will chime in I'm sure.
83361,Bernie,2007-06-13 18:16:00,3190,I think that fishing season is closed at that time. Not 100% sure cause I quit about mid September due to hunting season.
83385,Slimeball,2007-06-13 19:38:00,30,"Walleye and Perch close on October 15th. Musky, Bass, Pike.. close on Nov. 30th this year.  Jason"
83413,Whitemikeca,2007-06-13 20:49:00,138,I was in the west arm in early October last year.  We were only there for a weekend and we hit a nasty cold front.  The waves were brutal and we only managed to get about 6 or 7 hours of fishing in the whole weekend which resulted in only 3 mid size pike and 1 LM bass.  Because of the wind and the waves we fished mostly in sheltered bays.  I am sure we would have more success if it had not been for the weather.  Good luck.
83465,Muskieman,2007-06-13 23:38:00,2472,"THE WHOLE OF LAKE NIPISSING CLOSES ON OCTOBER 15 TH NO LINES MAY BE PUT IN THE WATER 'TIL JANUARY 1ST 2008 ,IT'S A SANCTUARY. NEW RULES FOR 2008, THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR WERE ABOLISHED 'TIL 2008 . SO NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOOD 'TIL NOVEMBER . I FISH IT DARN NEAR EVERY DAY , VERY VERY GOOD FOR BIG EYES AND PIKE AND HUGE MUSKIES. THE BIG BASS BITE IS ON AT THAT TIME TOO BUT SLOWING DOWN. IN THE FALL FISH GO BACK UP TRIBUTARIES LIKE THE FRENCH , STURGEON AND WASI RIVERS. I LIVE ON NIPISSING TAKE MY WORD. THE NEW RECORD MUSKIE WILL BE COMING OUT OF NIPISSING IN 2008 CAUSE BY THE TIME THE SEASON CLOSES THEY'RE JUST GETTING HUNGRY !! I CAN'T WAIT.  GOOD LUCK  MUSKIEMAN.."
83529,NDangler,2007-06-14 02:55:00,6,So fishing season is definitely closed at that time then? Well I guess that makes my decision about going then easier haha. Thanks for the input guys
83553,Slimeball,2007-06-14 07:25:00,30," Yes, the new regulations regarding fish species will not be in effect till the 2008 season, however the open water season will extend to November 30th (except for walleye and perch) this year 2007. If anyone has any questions regarding regulations for Nipissing/Upper French River contact: Scott Kaufman Large Lake Biologist Nipissing District Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 705-475-5537  Good Luck!
