I am hooking up with some other friends and heading to Lake Onaping a little north of Sudbury this weekend. We are staying at Northwoods Lodge , if anybody has fished Onaping before I would appreciate any advice or tips as this is a first for us. Thanks  for any info and I will post a report when I get back."
