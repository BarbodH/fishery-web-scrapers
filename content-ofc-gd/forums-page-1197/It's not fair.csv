83678,ufish2,2007-06-14 14:11:00,15,"Sorry to hear and I know your pain!  My father is battling adrenal cancer and has had 2 major surgeries in the matter of 6 months.  They said they got it all the first time when they took out his right side adrenal gland along with his spline and part of his pancreas then after spending 2 months in the hospital they found the cancer had spread to his other adrenal. So another major surgery and now he has bladder cancer.  He is the strongest person I know!!! always positive and takes life one day at a time.  My brothers and sisters have had a really hard time with this but it does bring you close together!! We do not understand Gods plan but he is the almighty and you have to put your trust in him!  Pray for Jesus to give you strength.  I try to kiss my kids and tell them I love them every day because you never know when you will be called to the next life.  My thought are with you, keep your chin up."

83969,jat,2007-06-15 00:11:00,138,"I remember reading an account of Saint Pio (Catholic Priest) I think....as far as I can recall, an individual asked him to find out from God why he was born blind and the priest said this, ""You are blind becuase God knows that this is the only way you will get to heaven"". The man's courage returned and left his future in the hands of God. Whatever happens to us in the end be assured that God does care...........he sees the whole picture and knows what is best....trust him even when its very hard to do so. God bless you and your family...."

83396,misfish,2007-06-13 20:03:00,29133,"As my regular routine when I arrive home ,I grab a cold one and read the family emails,and today I am in shock and am lost.  For those that remember my thread about my grandfather passing,well it seems the next one to feel the wrath is the one that took care of him for so many years.My aunt, whom I just celibrated with and my grandfather before his passing for or birthdays in April ,has been told she has Larynx Cancer.I believe in the powers above and that there is a god,but why would this happen to a women that gave her life to care for her father for so long, be given this burden. It seems when things are getting on the right track,there is always something that tries to take you down again,and again. I feel more for my pop because this is his sister,only sister, and losing his pop and now having to deal with this,I just dont know how to deal with it.It,s becoming very frustating and scary. By god I am so mad right now and Im not afraid to say, that tears are running down my face as I write this,but what in the name of the ol mighty above,does one have to do to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  You smoke, they say you,ll get cancer,you drink you,ll get liver cancer,you BBQ you,ll get cancer,is there anything in the world we cant do so we dont get CANCER????????????????????????????????????????????  I am going to do my darndest to catch pounds for  the cast for cure this year.  I have already given my money to the cause and the wife aswell,and even with that I know it,s  not enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  The wifes not home yet and she is not going to like the news as she is already going through this with her sister,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  I really have asked for nothing, but your prayers really would be helpful here.It seems to work for others from the board.    He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, who abides in the shadow of the Almighty, will say to the Lord, My refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust."

I told my friend just an hour ago to live her life to the fullest today, because if you plan to have fun later, later never comes.  I take care of my mother, by choice, and still live a wonderful life thank goodness. I know I won't be caring for her forever.   There are no guarantees in life.  I wake up every morning thanking the almighty that I have another day to enjoy.  Having friends on the internet helps too.  Pam"

83520,Joey,2007-06-14 02:38:00,9122,"Wow B, I just can believe this is happening to your family again.  I don't know the answer either and find it unfair how some people get cancer and never smoke, some people have liver problems and don't drink and the list goes on and on.  They say everything happens for a reason and that God has a purpose for everyone, but some times it just doesn't make any sense.  We're told to believe and put our trust in God, and I guess that is what we have to do.  We must be needed in heaven for a reason, so I can only hope that there is a reason for this to be happening to your family.  You and your family are in our thoughts B.  Joey & Paul"
83533,bpsbassman,2007-06-14 03:59:00,941,"My prayers are with your Aunt, Brian."

Your Aunt has a long road ahead of her, although from the sounds of it she has many loving people around her for a shoulder to cry on  and support when she will need it the most.  Sometimes that alone can cure a body and heal a soul.  Jen"
