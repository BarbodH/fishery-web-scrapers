84244,icefisherman,2007-06-15 18:57:00,952,"I bought a Big Jon manual rigger couple months ago and after using is 4-5 times the aluminium hollow piece that screws to the handle and has internal thread in it is bad. Basically the internal thread on the aluminium piece is gone and the piece needs to be replaced by another aluminium/original one or maybe better replaced by the same size piece but from steel to prevent same problem happening again in the future.  So, I am hoping someone has an old Big Jon rigger for parts and could sell me just that piece or the whole handle. Or if someone with the proper lathe/machine tool expertise could manufacture me same part but from steel. Hope my explanation is understandable. Here are few pictures I just did:    here is the thread that was ruined inside:   and this is the whole assembly:   Other then that part the rest of the rigger is fine but cannot be used until this get replaced. Had real hard time on Wednesday trying to get my cannon ball up in the boat after that part gave up on me while using it.  If someone can help me out please send a PM.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
