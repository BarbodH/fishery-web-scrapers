83887,Fisherpete,2007-06-14 20:24:00,1814,"Hit my fave pike spot with my bud this morning for about 5 hours, and man were they on! At first the day started slow with only 5 small ones caught in the first few hours, but then we moved to the other end of the bay and from 10am-12 noon we caught 15 pike, had just as many follows and many other attacks (misses) on our lures! Many were in the snot-rocket category, but a half dozen or more were in the mid 20"" range, with the best 4 coming in at 26"", 26"", 29"" and 29.5"". Made for a fun day on the water! Lure of choice today : good old red & white Daredevle!   "
