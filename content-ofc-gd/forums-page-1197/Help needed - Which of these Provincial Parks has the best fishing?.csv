84293,kennyman,2007-06-15 21:38:00,737,"The only one of the parks mentioned in your original query I had been to was Arrowhead. It is a very nice,very clean park. The showers are completely scrubbed and powerwashed every morning. Sw them doing it every day. I'm talking scrubbing everything until it was one big mass of foam. I was impressed. It was nice not to feel like you were getting dirtier by showering LOL. Anyway other than that the trails were really nice. If you go you have to do the Stubbs Falls trail. We canoed Arrowhead Lake and the Little East River to Stubbs Falls which was a short but scenic trip where you should see some resident beavers if you're stealthy enough. We only fished on Mayflower Lake. We caught panfish, but only a few and none of the rainbow trout which are supposedly stocked. The campsites are also very ""woodsy"" feeling and it doesn't take long to feel at home. I would highly recommend Arrowhead as a nice family camping trip although far from remote. Now Murphy's Point is completely different experience. The pull through sites are not much different than camping on a dirt driveway, but other than that it was a great place to camp. You can fish in Hogg Bay from shore or canoe around and either way you'll catch lots of panfish. The Big Rideau Lake is great. You can catch virtually anything in there. They hold a bass tournament in the area. We've caught panfish, bass and pike in there. Hopefully I'll catch a musky this time.  We'll be going there in about a month. The ammenities aren't quite as nice, but the natural enviroment is beautiful. One night we spent a while listening to the wolves howl. It was very cool. There were fireflies every night as well. Now the coons ..... I'm not too sure I like them. Brave little buggers. So I guess I wish the campsites were nicer, but I'm going back this year, so that speaks for itself. Hope this helps."
84297,kennyman,2007-06-15 21:56:00,737,Never stayed at the park but Long Point is a great spot to fish. Erie is a fish factory and there are sizeable smallmouths in that area. Also great for perch and pike. Caught all three there last week. Happy fishing.
84303,robinwood,2007-06-15 22:24:00,28,some years ago before I gave up campiing and started cottaging we spent some weekends up at Cyprus lake park near Tobermory- beautiful park on the escarpment - great hiking and views- there are some camp sites that back directly on to Cyprus Lake - we caugh a number of pickeral from out Canoe in Cyprus- you can also access Georgian Bay on foot - but I did not see anyone shore fishing .
83868,addy79,2007-06-14 19:22:00,573,"I spent an entire week up at restoule and have to agree, the fishing there is nearly non existant! we hooked into a few walleye adn bass but for the most part it was REALLY slow! There is another lake in the park, i can remember what it was called but its on the park property and ther is a boat launch there as well. Its a nicer lake with lots of promising spots, but again, could never find much more than small bass and the occasional walleye under 2lbs. Good luck to ya, let us know how it goes regardless.  BTW...  I've headed up to Halfway lake P.P.  (just north of sudbury near Cartier) and the fishing there was phenomenol for MONSTER pike, and healthy populations of lake trout. Very nice park, great beach, and clean waters"
83888,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-14 20:26:00,655,"Thanks for the warning about Restoule guys.  By the sounds of it, I may take a day trip to Nippissing one day, and also take my car topper with the 4hp Merc for a possible trip to a back lake.  More exploring anyway    Also, thanks for the tip on Halfway Lake.  What size pike, up to 15-pounds?  What is the average size?  007, I tried to get that weekend with the week as well, but they were booked solid on the Canada Day weekend, so we booked the Monday to Sat after the long weekend.  Looks like I will be getting there as you leave.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
