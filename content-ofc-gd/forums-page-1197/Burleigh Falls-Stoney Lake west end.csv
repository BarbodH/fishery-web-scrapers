84327,TangerineDream,2007-06-16 00:23:00,47,Launching out of Burleigh Falls to fish Stoney.     Walleye and Muskie tomorrow and want to know if anyone has any info on the walleye there lately. I gather they are starting to concentrate deeper off Islands and shoals. With the sunlight and hot weather this week they must be deep. Any info would be appreciated. And if anyone know how the Muskies have been lately and if they're also deep let me know. Thanks  Manitoba Rob
