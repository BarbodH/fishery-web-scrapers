83789,Bob Devine,2007-06-14 17:36:00,251,Got out this morning with my wife for some fun fishing on the Detroit River. The jig bite is still going strong. We had a limit of walleyes by 10am. Nothing big but a great day on the water and the weather was very cooperative. Lake Erie walleyes continue to be going strong with limit catches from Colchester to Leamington. I have been running Northland Crawler harnesses with the baitfish image blades. Last weekend we went thru 120 worms and landed LOTS of walleyes. The steelhead are just starting to show up at Wheatley and Erieau and I am looking forward to some high flying excitement!!

84283,Mark Kulik,2007-06-15 21:13:00,348,"Doesn't surprise me at all Bob, after our trip earlier in the year on the Detroit , I was really impressed, can't wait to get out again and hammer them Bob!"
84360,Dano,2007-06-16 02:29:00,719,"Now that looks like fun! Jigging for walleye with a city backdrop, never done it.  Do you need both U.s and Ontario fishing licenses?"
84367,Bob Devine,2007-06-16 02:49:00,251,"I do have both Ont and Mich licenses but it is not necessary. That being said with the number of NE winds that we get in the spring it is worth the $35 for the Mich license.  You can also purchase a 1 day Mich license that only costs $7, such a deal!!"
