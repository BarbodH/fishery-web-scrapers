84526,slime rocket,2007-06-16 20:26:00,3,Hey everybody!  I was wondering the best way to fish for lake trout.  We are driving north up to Nikina for our annual Canadian Fly-in fishing trip from Minnesota in about a week.  Uncles and cousins from Oregon and Colorado all met up with family in Minnesota to do this every year.  We try for lakers but only my brother has caught one.  Any advice as far as tackle and tactics go would be great.  Most of the time we are so caught up in Walleye and slime rockets that we neglect the lakers.  I guess its more fun when your catching fish!

My cousins fish northern ontario and they have most their success trolling with flashers and minnows.  I think the key is figuring out what depth they are at.  About a month ago they were no deeper than 20 feet in the lake I was fishing so they were easy to get to, in the summer they go to the bottom of that lake and don't bite as much, so we then tend to focus on bass and pike."

You could use inline weights or lead core line. Old timers prefer steel line. 6) check lure a action beside boat, speed should be ~ 1.5mph  Good Luck"
