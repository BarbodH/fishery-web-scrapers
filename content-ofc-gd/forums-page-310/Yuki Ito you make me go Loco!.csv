783460,TheMaverick,2013-04-30 14:12:00,93," I've yet to try my 110's, first year for me as well.  I've heard the Wakasagi works well.  Good luck!"
783461,TheMaverick,2013-04-30 14:14:00,93," We all know how the shimano story goes.....They lost me when they screwed up the Curado! Don't get me wrong, the G series is probably a good reel, but it will never be as good as the E series."
783495,ah_long,2013-04-30 16:17:00,354,"oh Ryan, you're making me miss the D7 I just sold..  fuego spinning on the other hand, I don't like all, not even sure if I like any of the new Daiwa Spinning stuff..  I'm going to Japan right now and I can't wait to see some new stuff (and possibly bring some back)"
783498,TheMaverick,2013-04-30 16:34:00,93, T3 SV   only out in June

783582,Jigger,2013-04-30 22:08:00,1237,Those poppers look too sexy to fish with. Very nice!
783835,ah_long,2013-05-01 22:30:00,354," couldn't find a T3 SV and a SV spool, so I settled for a metanium MG HG L and a Cardiff C2000SS Ci4+"

784158,Lape0019,2013-05-03 13:45:00,647,"I have been waiting 2 months for those megabass sticks to come in. They look great, but still ended up with a DX745 full grip. Awesome rod to pair with a my core 100mgfv. Lookig forward to trying it out soon.  I have used the 110's for a few seasons now. I love them and my most productive color is deadly black. It has a kind of chameleon affect on the top of it and the under belly is orange. You dont find them to often because this was a color from 2003 but I have seen them online a few times.  As for the bill breaking, I have heard it is more due to the way us north americans fish... Apparantly they were not desigined to be bashed off rocks and stumps but they have remedied that by comming out with the coffin style bill. I mainly use them in open water for smallis so I think I will stick with the originals.  I did by a zcrank in pearl white and a pop max jr that I am looking forward to trying out this year. Their finishes look lifelike for the most part and the paint is gorgeous so I hope they work out well for me."

785704,musky_hunter,2013-05-10 18:30:00,328,"Looks like i lucked out and got my Orochi XX i wanted. The rods are selling good, not sure if they will last till the opener. Will be pairing it with a Alphas Ito. Once my parts come in i'll be out using it for walleye. LOL!"
783256,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 22:58:00,93,"First year trying out the MegaBass brand, can't wait!      StarTzar, post the 110's ?"
783265,davey buoy,2013-04-29 23:07:00,5505,Do they ever look life like!! Nice! Lots of detail.
783266,StarTzar,2013-04-29 23:08:00,51,.... and to think that they refused to let us put their logo on our Tourney shirt. Someone should let them know that it's the weekend fisherman that sells a lot more than the Pros.
783267,StarTzar,2013-04-29 23:12:00,51,"No. Stop over tomorrow, take them home with you, take pics and post them yourself. I'm still pouting at the fact that they refused to let us put their logo on our jerseys."
783269,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 23:13:00,93, Who cares lo0ol won't stop me from buying a Black Elseil
783284,musky_hunter,2013-04-29 23:31:00,328,"once you go jdm baits you can't go back.i have 2 3700 boxes full of them. the scary thing is, i probably have 10% of some members.you should checkout the new megabass orochi xx rods at Pro J. You'll find it tough to find a more balanced rod for the price."
783287,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 23:36:00,93,"The XX line up will be at my local store tomorrow, Paddletales in Winchester.  I have a Black Elseil coming in tomorrow as well and can't wait to handle one of the XX rods, wondering how they compare to the Dobyns DX series."
783290,musky_hunter,2013-04-29 23:39:00,328,let me know what you think...compare it to all the brands.  i am having a hard time deciding which rods to get.
783294,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 23:41:00,93," Why are you selling the Phoenix, if I may ask?  almost pulled the trigger on one, but the mix reviews made me back out!"
783297,musky_hunter,2013-04-29 23:51:00,328,"because i have my heart set on some megabass rods to go with some megabass reels. i haven't even fished with the 714!   the recon 2 is very nice for the $. for the $170-$190 good value.  much better than many other brand in the same price range. i put it ahead of the gl2, crucial, aetos, etc..."
783332,buick14,2013-04-30 01:09:00,741,"Yuki Ito is one crazy mother trucker .  Works of Art!  Sucks when u cast an Ito and snag her, or get toothy critters demoing them.  At least (so far) I find them supppper durable!"
783333,TheMaverick,2013-04-30 01:11:00,93,"Might take a while to reply, i'm on moderator watch looolol, for what it's worth, i share your passion for MegaBass baits.  Thanks for the feed back."
783339,StarTzar,2013-04-30 01:18:00,51,"It's nice to see that other people suffer from the same affliction.  Musky_Hunter, that is an impressive collection."
783340,sauce,2013-04-30 01:19:00,219,"Careful with 110's in shallow water. Especially in cold water.  Friend of mine has had the lip break off on 2 or 3. Some come with no split ring for line tie. Add one or attach with a small cross lock snap. Same friend has broken a couple off on small fish. No split ring, he was tying direct and figures the line rubbing on the lures eye weakened his knot. Trick darter is another wicked ito bait. Anyone tried rick clunn's ito knock offs? I've heard theyre great once you change the hooks."
783345,StarTzar,2013-04-30 01:21:00,51," The toothy critters have me worried. Don't want to lose too many. At $20+ a crack, it can get fairly expensive."
783346,StarTzar,2013-04-30 01:24:00,51,We have purchased some Rick Clunn knock offs. We will be trying those in thoothy critter infested waters.
783397,mbac31,2013-04-30 03:19:00,904,Looks like Megabass is finally catching on. Musky. Hunter and Buick you guys have not even graduated into the addiction yet. im gonna get the camera and look for some megabass baits. I almost got a megabass tattoo once.
783402,musky_hunter,2013-04-30 03:57:00,328,bugger!
783403,ah_long,2013-04-30 04:11:00,354,"megabass lures are great, but there are other japanese brands that offer something nice for less $$  it's nice they're making the rods more affordable, but I don't like the direction they're going with reels. Almost every reel in the JDM Daiwa line up has a MB variation and some of them are more cosmetic than performance."
783425,TheMaverick,2013-04-30 10:40:00,93," Depends where you shop, you can even get them used at very reasonable prices.  But I agree there are other JDM brands worth buying.  Megabass reels have always been to high in price for my taste, I'd consider a Zonda but that's about it."
783431,musky_hunter,2013-04-30 11:17:00,328,"With the new megabass pricing they will be hard to beat, the baits dropped allot. Sail had 110 and the poppers at $20. That's only $3-4 more than lucky craft and jackall. With megabass pushing for NA sales, I see a cheaper megabass reel to match the current rods."
783453,ah_long,2013-04-30 13:23:00,354,do you really want a cheaper MB reel? and what's wrong with us? $300 rods are cheap now?
783454,mbac31,2013-04-30 13:48:00,904,"They have cheapened the baits considerably. You want higher end 110 baits, buy their Sw versions. Not made the same at all. That goes for all JDM baits. SW Versions are made still with the old resin formulas. As for their reels, JDM models are really not that much different anymore. Long gone are the days when you can get that hard to find reel,rod,bait,etc. However if you look you can still find some sweet stuff that is still out of reach for most.  Some of the so called NA, JDM stuff we get here is swept off the floor and packaged for NA after they build the reel stuff."
783455,musky_hunter,2013-04-30 13:51:00,328,"Long, for you it's cheap."
783456,Ainsley,2013-04-30 13:52:00,142,"Got my first 110 a few weeks ago and I'm really looking forward to fishing it.  Used some lucky craft pointers last season and really enjoyed them. What is everyone's fav colour in the 110? I'll mostly be fishing Erie, Niagara and Ontario."
