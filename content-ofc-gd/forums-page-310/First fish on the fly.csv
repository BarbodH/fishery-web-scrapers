785010,Locnar,2013-05-07 22:23:00,645,"First fish on the fly! Not very big, or impressive... but it's a start. Caught about 9 of these little guys today. And lost one that was significantly bigger, by the looks of it... it was nearly 16 inches.    Also saw lots and lots of these nasty things in the river. This one was the biggest.  "
785012,Christopheraaron,2013-05-07 22:38:00,3525,hey if your first wasn't a chub I'd say you did pretty well! What fly? looks like a brassie...
785025,Locnar,2013-05-07 23:40:00,645,"That's what I figured... it's a trout, I must be doing something right. Not too sure on the name of the fly... it was a bronzy colour nymph. Quite small."
785029,FloatnFly,2013-05-07 23:46:00,1640,"nice go on the fly, the first is always the hardest, i got 2 on the weekend that were a lot smaller, not even half the size of yours  the second pic is a sad sight to see, as it looks like the belly was split, someone farming roe and letting the fish spoil"
785032,misfish,2013-05-08 00:00:00,29133," This late into the season? I dont think so. Looks like a sad drop back,that didnt make it.IMO.  Nice first there. I started the same. Happy as can be I improved this weekend. Getting bigger.  Keep ater. Love the fly."
785034,Richard S.,2013-05-08 00:05:00,75,"Last week we got a few fresh fish that were still skien, and many more that were still digging redds. So yes it is possible to get loose fish this late in the season.  Rich."
785037,FloatnFly,2013-05-08 00:10:00,1640,"  lots of fish still moving up and on the redds where i fish, plus lots waiting to come up,  its a pretty fat belly to be a drop back"
785049,Locnar,2013-05-08 00:32:00,645,"The belly didn't look slit open to me. There were many others as well... this one was by far the biggest. I'll be gettin' back out there when I get my next day off... which is in like... 9 bloody days... It's definitely an interesting style of fishing. After I lost that much nicer sized trout, I'm gonna have to redeem myself."
785053,FloatnFly,2013-05-08 00:41:00,1640,"  i was just judging by the dark line down the centre of the belly just behind the gills from the picture  and you will redeem yourself, even if its not in the spring, theres the fall run to consider when they're much stronger fresh from the lake"
785056,Locnar,2013-05-08 00:44:00,645,"Even to get some decent sized resident brookies or browns and I'd be ecstatic. Trout fishing has always been a mystery to me, so this is already a big step up from where I was before today."
785058,Christopheraaron,2013-05-08 00:49:00,3525,So what wt rod do you have?
785060,Locnar,2013-05-08 00:51:00,645,6wt
785070,Christopheraaron,2013-05-08 01:05:00,3525,"good choice, it  can handle most fish but you can still have some fun in the creeks. Try taking it to those carp ponds of yours and you'll have some real fun now"
785084,kickingfrog,2013-05-08 02:03:00,8333,It'll be a 10lb brookie that came out of a stump field when you're telling your grandkids.
785133,mirogak,2013-05-08 11:34:00,387,Lol so true
785138,BillM,2013-05-08 11:55:00,17367,6wt is a bit much for those small resident fish.  a 3/4wt is the ticket.
785144,FloatnFly,2013-05-08 12:15:00,1640,"6wt will do you well for bows and browns, but for brookies, 4wt or even 3 would be better.  personally i went with an 8wt this year, was hooking into fish in the 10lb range and felt more comfortable with the 8wt over my 6wt"
785151,Christopheraaron,2013-05-08 12:27:00,3525,If you're looking for an 8 wt theres a thomas and thomas in the classifieds right now for $250
785155,torco,2013-05-08 13:17:00,656,"Great start...Fly fishing becomes very addictive, enjoy"
785321,pidge,2013-05-08 23:38:00,438,Nice job on the first outing with the fly rod. About the same size my buddy and I were catching opener.
