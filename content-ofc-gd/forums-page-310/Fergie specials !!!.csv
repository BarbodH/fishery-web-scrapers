785547,fishindevil,2013-05-09 21:48:00,6254,Does anyone know of any tackle shop in the GTA or in southern Ontario that carries the Fergie special lures ???  They are from patersons reel-bait in Nebraska but it looks like shipping prices are outrageous ?? Maybe I read it wrong but would like to know if they are here in Ontario to avoid crazy shipping.    Thanks
