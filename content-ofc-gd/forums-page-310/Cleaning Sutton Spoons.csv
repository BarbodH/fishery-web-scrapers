Does any one here clean there spoons with something to bring back the shine ? I was thinking about a basic cleaner (brasso I think) but not to sure if it will leave a fish spooking scent trail while trolling ! Thanks"
785879,Sinker,2013-05-11 16:15:00,8692,"Sometimes the tarnished spoons work the best. I've even had days where taking a lighter to my spoon, and blackening it up, was the difference between a great day and a skunk.  I've never tried any type of cleaner, but I'd be a little leary of that myself.  Just make sure the hooks aren't rusty, and they're sharp!  S."

785901,smitty55,2013-05-11 19:14:00,928,Baking soda will polish them up fine. For more heavy duty cleaning try Barkeeper's Friend or Zud if you can find it.Amazing cleaners for metal. Cheers
785904,adempsey,2013-05-11 20:04:00,1498,"If they are silver plated (I think they are, I don't recall), could try the old baking soda in hot water with aluminum foil trick.  Works well and you don't need any harsh chemical cleaners.    "

785962,fishindevil,2013-05-12 08:02:00,6254,Also mr clean manic eraser will bring some back to life as well !!!! It really shines chrome as well !!! If a spoon is really bad I will paint it with sparkling nail polish and that has caught me fish as well !!!! Some great ideas as well !!!!! Tight-lines
785970,dave524,2013-05-12 11:47:00,4508,"be careful using abrasives on spoons with a true silver or gold plating , often it is not very thick and you can wear through."
