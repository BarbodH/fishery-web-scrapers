The spinning rod is my latest project i've done, it's also a GLX 6' 10"" medium. I turned the reel seat and butt from a piece of stabalized buckeye burl. The handle was done with natural and burnt cork mix with a few pieces of natural burl. The last pics are of new handles I made for two of my float reels. One set is cocobolo and the other is marbled acrylic."

785602,ADB,2013-05-10 02:01:00,444,Great work...that spinning reel looks funny on the beautiful rod though!
785604,Ryan Landry,2013-05-10 02:07:00,128,"lol! it's a sustain. I'm not a big fan of the handle, I'll probably end up making a new one!"
