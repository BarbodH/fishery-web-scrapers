785523,BillM,2013-05-09 20:18:00,17367,It's time to take some swimming lessons.
785528,young_one,2013-05-09 20:32:00,620,"Thanks for sharing, quite a story.  Life jackets..."
785529,musky_hunter,2013-05-09 20:38:00,328," Good point Will, i never take off my Mustang HIT."
785538,Ron,2013-05-09 21:20:00,1683,"Wow, I feel for you and your brother. Like you, I soon discovered no fish is worth our life. I have taken more than my fair share of stupid stunts. The phrase comes to mind ""It'll never happen to me"".  Last year, i opted to stay on an island overnight instead of doing the stupid stunt  of driving my boat in gale force winds. the good news is, we are still here to talk about it. The year before, I thought we were done for out in the middle of the lake. I still have 2 stress cracks above the water line in my boat as a reminder  Glad things worked out OK for you. I think you owe your brother an apology, as did i with my good fishing buddy.  Cheers, Ron..."

785553,Sinker,2013-05-09 22:24:00,8692,"Thanks for sharing.  Wear a life jacket, AND learn to swim. It could save your brothers life as well as yours, or anyone elses.  S."
785570,aplumma,2013-05-09 23:27:00,6896,Good thoughts thank you for sharing.   Art
785573,Nipfisher,2013-05-09 23:56:00,2449,"Kevin, Thanks for telling us your story. I have one that I have never told on here before. Please excuse me from hijacking your thread but here it is.  In 1974 my oldest brother (Brent) drowned at the age of 4. He fell into a fast moving creek when he walked away from my father who was distracted for a moment. IT ONLY TAKES A MOMENT! They thought he had been abducted but was found downstream hours later. My mother was pregnant with me at the time and my older brother (Trevor) was 2 yrs. old.  My parents later had a 4th son (Neil) and he is 2 years my younger.  All 3 of us surviving Buchmann boys were certified lifeguards and swimming instructors. It was not an option. Our mother would have it no other way. I personally saved 4 people from drowning in our local pool. Included in those was a mother and 4 year old son who were drowning each other in panic (called ""double clutch""). As a result of my training I also saved a boy from choking by using the heimlich maneuver in our hiugh school cafiteria. Pretty sure Brent helped me out in those instances.  My boys are now 10 and 4. They are both excellent swimmers for their ages. However, I was terrified to learn that last Saturday my 10 year old retrieved a soccer ball from a fast moving creek here. He did not get wet but got an earfull from me.   Kevin....PLEASE get swimming lessons. There are sessions for adults to ""learn to swim"" at your local pool. If you know others who can't swim get them to go with you. Drownings are seldom unpreventable.  May 6th would have been Brent's 42nd birthday. I never met him but always miss him.  With the greatest respect.  Blair Buchmann"
785579,Fishing 24/7,2013-05-10 00:20:00,709,"  thank you for your great story , this was 3 years ago and im not the best swimmer but iv learnt the basic. i wont be able to swim long distances but i can swim now, the probleme with my story is that i was fully dressed. jeans are heavy in the water. and i only weight 135 lbs with no fat to help me surface im like an anchor .... i know you will say eveyone can float but for me its harder . i swear ill get lessons. thanks"
785618,Nipfisher,2013-05-10 02:51:00,2449," Kevin, your local pool will have a learn to swim program for adults and one lesson is swimming with clothes on. I too was a skinny lad and never floated well. Best advise for in a boat besides wearing a lifejacket is loose shoes or boots. You have to be able to kick them off if you go in the water. Many years ago a teen age boy died on his grad night while canoeing close to shore. They tipped the boat and he was wearing steel toe work boots. When they recovered his body he was standing on the bottom of the lake with the surface just 1.5 feet above him."
785619,Out4Trout,2013-05-10 03:00:00,98," Glad you're still on the good side of the grass!! Amazing and personal story, thanks for sharing. "
785700,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-10 18:13:00,8243,"Both fantastic stories, thanks for sharing I know it probably difficult. Hopefully it can be a lesson to us all concerning water safety, life and death and how fragile we as humans really are.  I always have my PDF on before I get in the boat and have found I still had it on driving down the road on the way home. I don't mind if someone takes their jackets off when we are not running from spot to spot. I will not start the boat for a run unless they put one on. The stand pat answer is, "" come on buddy, I know how to swim! "", my stand pat answer is "" you see that shoreline a few miles from here, can you make it there?"" if you can't you can't swim. Swimming a few laps in a back yard pool or even a few laps in an Olympic size before you need to stop and hold onto the side is NOT swimming, it's a controlled float.  In fact thinking about it, new rule this year, the jacket stays on unless your' re Joanne Mallar. Then she puts it on going full out. Don't like it stay home or buy a PDF. Better yet buy your own boat and do whatever you want. So the stories have made a difference already, thanks."
785707,snagmaster,2013-05-10 18:35:00,250,Wow....Nuts....Im always wearing a pdf for now on...You never know
785711,Fishing 24/7,2013-05-10 18:43:00,709,i would never jump in the water for no reason.................... unless like you guys say you never know....... i mean this BASS was a huge fish you guys know me by now «????? i mean i post enough QC report here for you to know i catch some nice bass. but this one was a seriouse 7 lbs fish it jumped twice. a SUBMARINE ... a true PIG... OINKER ..... A SMALL GOAT!   a reflexe does not pass threw the brain. i did not think about jumping ion the water. when i say that i lost the fish the white big-o came popping out of the water and the fish was right there within hands reach......... my body flew in the water .......  its was pure instinct.....................  and 1-2 minutes goes fast but when your on the high way to dying it goes in slow mo.  when mike jumped i knew ......  thannks for the great replies and stories .  keep them comming.  i know im not the only one here that that had these types of thing happend to him.  speak up i want to hear about them. learn about the dangers and stay away from them the only way to know is to talk about them.
785716,NAW,2013-05-10 19:22:00,4022,"Wow.  Thanks for sharing that.  ""something that was kept ''secret'' a story of pure stupidity""  I could not imagine the feeling of being on or near water, knowing I could not swim.  And the fact that you jumped in the water, knowing you could not swim.  What the hell man.....  I bet you've been flamed really really hard over the years be people when you tell them that story!  Rightfully so.  One of the stupidest things I have ever herd in my life..."
785736,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-10 21:28:00,8243,"That's not fair. I'm sure the guy has been being told how stupid he was for years. It takes a big set of corliones to admit to stupidity. And I dare anyone to say they have never done anything stupid that was dangerous and could have killed themselves or anyone else. That person doesn't exist. He said it was instincts that took over. I think swimming with sharks and jumping out of a perfectly good plane is stupid too. Bungee jumping is stupid. But whom am I too call those that do stupid?  Having a few beers and driving is the stupidest thing we can do, and everyone that drinks has done it at least once, now that's really stupid."
785788,pidge,2013-05-11 01:12:00,438,Well glad your green side up man no doubt that was scary. I had a close call when I was younger in a pool. I'll never forget the panic situation I was in. I cant imagine with clothes on. Man. Lesson learned Im sure and your here today to talk about it.

785851,Whitespinnerbait,2013-05-11 11:19:00,2038,  Millions of people out there don't know how to FLY. yet they still get on a plane every now and then....
785852,lew,2013-05-11 11:27:00,12766," Flying in an airplane, you've got a pretty good chance of surviving the trip unless it crashes.  Falling into rough water, fully clothed, without a life jacket and unable to swim, your chances aren't quite as good."
785853,davey buoy,2013-05-11 11:29:00,5505,"I have one friend who can't swim,but he wears his life jacket allllllll the time. Loves fishing. Won't take a chance of not wearing one.. Who can fault that?I can't."
