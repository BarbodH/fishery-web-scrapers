785172,RDR,2013-05-08 14:42:00,125,"BONA WHO?  I was there Jimmer   Joe is definitely a must see, if you appreciate extrordinary playing   Great show by the band and I thought his new keyboard player Arlen did a fantastic job. His interaction and fills were awesome. Looking forward to seeing them play in NYC at the Beacon Theater on the 17th.  JOE ROCKS!!!"
785188,blaque,2013-05-08 15:48:00,2419,I just saw him on palladia (basically a live music channel) and was very impressed. It was entertaining enough that i put down the tools to sit and watch the whole show
785253,misfish,2013-05-08 20:24:00,29133,"Rock95 was giving away tickets for his show. I had never heard of him before,so I did a youtube search. The first song I listened to was this one.   I tried and tried after that, to win tickets. Great stuff."
785725,jimmer,2013-05-10 20:07:00,2730,"That was one of his last songs he played. I had a couple of those gold top Les Pauls, but sadly sold them to first purchase furniture, then hunting equipment. Kicking myself now. He didn't use that guitar at Rama. It seemed his favourite was a natural wood grain Les Paul."

I'm sure I got  a few videos in the "" what are you listening to "" thread. Check out his work with "" Black Country Communion "" too , best rock I've heard since the 70's"
785882,RDR,2013-05-11 16:19:00,125,Joe having some fun and making it sing  You've got some time on me Dave and clearly you have good taste
