785390,Joey,2013-05-09 03:53:00,9122,"This has been going on in my backyard for about 2 hours now.  I have searched the whole neighbourhood and it is definately in my backyard, but it is too dark to see anything.  Is is a frog or bug.  Has anyone ever heard this before.  It is so loud!  "
785391,Ron,2013-05-09 03:55:00,1683,"Welcome to the American Toad!  Cheers, Ron... Call: The call is a monotone trill up to 30 seconds long, preceded by a single, slightly lower introductory note. In a breeding chorus each male selects a different note to call on.   http://www.naturewatch.ca/english/frogwatch/species_details.asp?species=0"
785393,Joey,2013-05-09 03:56:00,9122,"Wow, really Ron.  Never heard one that loud in my life!!!  Thanks!"
785394,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-09 03:57:00,10439,Spring peepers!!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_peeper
785404,fishindevil,2013-05-09 10:38:00,6254,Yes spring peepers !!!!! We have tons of them where I live !!!!!! They sure make a racket !!!!!! There is a big farm pond about 1/8 mile from my house and they have been at it for about 2 weeks now !!!!!! Every spring I love it!!!! Have to dodge them on the road every morning on the way to work !!!!! Lol
785406,wallacio,2013-05-09 10:50:00,475,Ron has it right...it's an American Toad.   Spring Peepers' calls are much shorter.
785409,fishindevil,2013-05-09 11:07:00,6254,"yes we have just always called them that since we were kids sorry...its like the pickeral,walleye thing !!!! lol...."
785415,Joey,2013-05-09 12:00:00,9122,"Well I just find it weird I've lived in Ontario most of my life, born and raised, moved a few times in and around Ontario, and I have never heard anything this loud.  I actually thought it was someone's house alarm going off at first.  Sure was neat and after awhile, it lulled me to sleep"
785425,Christopheraaron,2013-05-09 12:41:00,3525,"Yup, I have a friend in Waterloo with a pond in his backyard, he gets thousands every year lol"
785428,Sinker,2013-05-09 13:02:00,8692,"I open my pool early every year just to keep them ouut of it. It gets really loud when you get a bunch of them, and spring peepers all together!  Right now I have this dumb woodpecker who keeps pecking on my sat dish. Its like a gong going off every morning at 445am! I'd rather have the toads and peepers! Even my neighbours are complaining lol  S."
785429,Chance,2013-05-09 13:03:00,420,Sounds like an alien calling the mother ship for pick up. Any little green fellas in the yard Joey.

785625,Joey,2013-05-10 03:33:00,9122,"Well he's back again tonight, and he brought friends this time  Guess I'd better start enjoying the noise and hopefully it will lull me to sleep"
