785230,Gallie,2013-05-08 18:51:00,1215,Hi guys. I was wondering if someone could tell me if the ice is off the lakes up there? I leave next tuesday for a week of pike but ive been hearing conflicting reports on ice out and water levels. Either way im going but any help on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you
785278,chris.brock,2013-05-08 21:28:00,4053,"from the satellite pics, it looks like you'll be fine, most lakes wide open, a little ice on Nighthawk, Abitibi is covered but looking close to melting"
785280,Musky or Specks,2013-05-08 21:42:00,2710,Water is high
785286,Gallie,2013-05-08 22:06:00,1215,Thanks a lot guys! I guess the ranger is gonna get a workout on the trails... Looks good on er.
785288,chris.brock,2013-05-08 22:17:00,4053,"Gallie, post a report when you get back, I would love to read it"
785295,Nipfisher,2013-05-08 22:43:00,2449,The water on Lake Kenogami and Lake Sessiginika (both along Hwy. 11N) will be open by the time you get there. Herbie the Volkswagon Beetle that sits out on Lake Kenogami went through the ice around midnight on May 5th.
785296,Gallie,2013-05-08 22:45:00,1215,"Definitely, ive been looking forward too gettin a report up but all ive done so far is crappie and sucker"

785339,Joeytier,2013-05-09 00:35:00,3990,I took a drive by kipawa today and it ls completely open as of about late last week so you should be hitting ice out beautifully up there
785360,TJQ,2013-05-09 01:49:00,7806,Im at camp and there is no ice on the river.. and VERY little snow left in the bush.
785361,Gallie,2013-05-09 01:50:00,1215,I cant wait
