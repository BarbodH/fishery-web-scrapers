785174,Headhunter,2013-05-08 14:46:00,5703,"Bass Boat.....  A good old Kentucky boy won a bass boat in a raffle drawing. He brought it home and his wife looks at him and says,  ""What you gonna do with that. There ain't no water deep enough to float a boat within 100 miles of here.""  He says, ""I won it and I'm a-gonna keep it.""  His brother came over to visit several days later. He sees the wife and asks where his brother is.  She says, ""He's out there in his bass boat"", pointing to the field behind the house.  The brother heads out behind the house and sees his brother in the middle of a big field sitting in a bass boat with a fishing rod in his hand . He yells out to him, ""What are you doin'?""  His brother replies, ""I'm fishin'. What does it look like I'm a doin'?""  His brother yells, ""It's people like you that give people from Kentucky a bad name, makin' everybody think we're stupid. If I could swim, I'd come out there and whip your ass!""  HH"
