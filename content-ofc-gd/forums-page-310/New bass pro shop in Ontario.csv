785354,woodenboater,2013-05-09 01:26:00,2277,and I was in NOTL today and didn't notice anything...ha ha
785355,danc,2013-05-09 01:30:00,4677,"Cabelas could build a store at the north pole, charge admission, and it would still make money."
785356,BillM,2013-05-09 01:30:00,17367,"Weird they consider that NOTL, I'd say St.Davids if anything (Lived in St.Catharines for 28 years)"
785359,pics,2013-05-09 01:44:00,1268,While I like to visit the store I never seem to buy much..I still spend my cash at Fishing world or Bills bait....
785364,Handlebarz,2013-05-09 02:00:00,3790,Not that I want a big box down here in SW Ontario but I always thought London area would be awesome right in the heart for people heading to all destinations fishing. Even Americans would stop in just because its a familiar store.
785373,BillM,2013-05-09 02:31:00,17367, Don't you have a Cabelas a few hours away from you?
785397,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-09 05:24:00,8243," When deciding a big box retail location a simple circle is drawn around an area. If you draw a circle encompassing 40 miles around St. Kitts, St. David's or NOTL or  whatever you wish to call it you have more than one million residents including Western NY. That's a big market. There are many people that won't even think about driving towards TO from the Hammer/Niagara anymore unless absolutely necessary. I'd rather go to Gander Mountain in Tonawanda then to Bass Pro Shop outside TO. Same time traveling, or less. The border wait included."
785403,zamboniwaterboy,2013-05-09 10:36:00,126,You have Ramakkos!  Awesome store.  Will order you anything you want.
785422,kickingfrog,2013-05-09 12:24:00,8333,"There are many people who won't drive to T.O. to shop, but there are more who would never cross the border to stop in Canada from NY state unless our dollar gets back down to 64 cents."
785434,Sinker,2013-05-09 13:16:00,8692,"Well, I won't drive to the vaughn mills location, so you can forget about NOTL.  I'll keep buying from my local small guy who gets me everything I need, usually cheaper than BPS and always has fresh coffee waiting"
785443,Rich,2013-05-09 14:04:00,3927,I'd rather go out that way than go anywhere near the evil toronto.. jus sayin
785512,Handlebarz,2013-05-09 19:55:00,3790,Yeah it's about 2-2.5 hours depending on the bridge to USA. But I don't make trips to just hit it. I'm kinda spoiled with having two gander mountain stores 1 BPS and Janns net craft on my daily drive. I don't shop at them all the time I rather hit the local stores like Ed's baits in wallaceburg or bass haven.  I just thought that London would be a great spot for a big box and am shocked that there is not one yet.
785574,Lunatic,2013-05-10 00:01:00,536,Fishing world could be giving things away and i still wouldnt go.and it was closest store to me.
785629,pikehunter,2013-05-10 07:13:00,1659,"It's a great business location! Right along side one of the bussiest traffic corriders in North America in view of day trippers to the falls, tourists from around the world, crossborder shoppers stopping in on their way back from the States and there's the Buffalo Niagara market. Have any of you driven to the falls on a summer Saturday or Sunday? Amost always a traffic jamb or at least slow going. And then add the million or so who live in the Hamilton area alone who detest Toronto or hate driving to Toronto Bass Pro. Just think of who the major competitor is...""SAIL!"" Who the hell cares about Sail? It's a waste of real estate!  Downside, the independant shops will be facing a tougher battle."
785669,redwings24,2013-05-10 14:30:00,15,That usually seems to be the case all the time. cheaper and better selection
785673,BucktownAngler,2013-05-10 14:46:00,582,didnt realize so many Hamiltonians hated Toronto  is this a TiCats/Argos thing?
785674,lew,2013-05-10 14:50:00,12766, Even Torontonians hate Toronto Boss
785678,fishnsled,2013-05-10 15:23:00,3520,Very true.
785756,walleye wanderer,2013-05-10 23:08:00,64,"  Buffalo blew off BP years ago when they were gonna put up a store, now there gonna drag all the americans just over the border."
785759,Tayzak15,2013-05-10 23:15:00,318,This haha. Northern Ontario is spoiled having Ramakkos. Live in Timmins and I order all of my gear from there. Cheapest prices I'm able to find on new gear.
785814,moemoe,2013-05-11 03:03:00,352,and then leave as they will realize the prices are nowwhere near the same as the us
785820,kickingfrog,2013-05-11 03:27:00,8333,New corporate strategy. Put a store in a location that has higher operating/employee costs only miles from an international boarder that would reduce those very same costs.
785821,irishfield,2013-05-11 03:27:00,26272,Just shop at Gramp's... 6 miles short of Temagami... you'll get a better selection!
785146,kickingfrog,2013-05-08 12:18:00,8333,Just announced for Niagara on the Lake.  Still waiting for a Cabelas.
785157,SmokestackLightnin,2013-05-08 13:22:00,390,"I thought for sure Cabelas would have located in Barrie, first at Park Place and now at the Duckworth expansion."
785170,BillM,2013-05-08 14:23:00,17367,"Cabelas, we need one here."

785179,limeyangler,2013-05-08 15:15:00,5204,hope you guys get a better Cabelas than the place in Winnipeg!
785181,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-08 15:21:00,10439,They are building a new Cabelas in Winnipeg. The original building was originally SIR before Cabelas bought it as their first store in Canada.  My local Cabelas store is sadly in Edmonton about 1500 kms South of me.
785183,bare foot wader,2013-05-08 15:31:00,1354,"  you're not missing anything ,that store is not worth a visit....poor selection and I saw many items that were incredibly over priced, I don't know about other cabela locations but the edmonton store doesn't have anything on BPS"
785184,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-08 15:35:00,10439,They are building a BassPro and Cabelas in Anchorage AK over the next 2 years so I'll be able to hit them on me fall vacay.
785191,Guest ----,2013-05-08 16:04:00,0,"I emailed Cabelas a few months back inquiring about the possibility of an ontario location. This was their response:  Thank you for your recent email.Cabela's Canada has just announced a new store opening in Regina, SK. There are no other new store announcements at this time. All new store announcements will made available on our website http://www.cabelas.ca.Should you have any further questions, please call us at 1-800-265-6245 where a Customer Service Representative will be able to assist you further.Cabela's Canada1-800-265-6245http://www.cabelas.ca"
785200,adempsey,2013-05-08 17:06:00,1498,"For fishing,  I still prefer Le Barons and my local shops.  Hopefully BPS expanding is a sign of good things on the horizon for the tourism industry."
785201,Muskieman,2013-05-08 17:12:00,2472,Either stores should consider a location somewhere between North Bay and Sudbury .
785217,Harrison,2013-05-08 18:05:00,2202,"No doubt Cabelas is coming. They are going to really sting the local shops IMO. Thy focus on more products geared to the Canadian angler then BPS.<br /><br />Consumers may welcome American corporations, but Canadians competiting with small businesses sure don't."
785226,JoshS,2013-05-08 18:47:00,729,Cabela's would be awesome. Couldn't care a less about BPS!
785234,davey buoy,2013-05-08 18:58:00,5505,Oh that's far to close for me at Duckworth  How much can I spend lol.
785257,captpierre,2013-05-08 20:44:00,2521,"Niagara on the Lake is awefully out of the way.  I bet you it'll be near the QEW somewhere.  Interesting, they were going to put one in Buffalo but withdrew"
785263,Burtess,2013-05-08 20:53:00,901,"I would rather one in Buffalo, that way we get the American pricing and somewhat different selection.  Burt"
785266,paul_614,2013-05-08 20:57:00,168,"It is right beside the higway, between Leons and White Oaks"

785273,kickingfrog,2013-05-08 21:12:00,8333,"From bps website:  Bass Pro Shops Announces Plans to Open Third Canadian Store in Niagra-On-The-Lake, Ontario Springfield, Missouri-- (May 7, 2013) Bass Pro Shops, America’s most popular outdoor store, will locate its third Canadian store in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario as an anchor for The Outlet Collection at Niagara—a 520,000-square-foot shopping center under construction by Ivanhoé Cambridge.  The new 80,000 square-foot Bass Pro Shops® Outpost store will be at the intersection of Queen Elizabeth Way and Glendale Avenue, this high visibility site will be the new gateway to the Niagara Peninsula.  Niagara-on-the-Lake enjoys a rich tradition of outdoor sports and history as it is situated in Southern Ontario where the Niagara River meets Lake Ontario.  Some 10 million people visit this area each year and another 2.5 million people are within an hour’s drive of the site. “It’s an incredible opportunity for Bass Pro Shops to place our third Canadian store in this beautiful part of Southern Ontario,” said Johnny Morris, Founder.  “We are very excited to bring Bass Pro Shops to this premier site in Niagara-on-the-Lake and we are very grateful to developer Ivanhoé Cambridge for selecting Bass Pro Shops to be the premier anchor tenant in this extraordinary new retail development. We look forward to bringing Bass Pro Shops’ low prices and friendly expert service to the many sportsmen and women who live in the region.  We are also excited to add to the momentum of an area that already draws millions of visitors each year,” Morris continued. Bass Pro Shops will host over 120 million people visiting their 77 stores and Tracker Marine Centers across America and Canada this year; the average customer stays 2 ½ hours and drives an average distance of 50+ miles.  Bass Pro Shops was recently named by Advertising Age magazine as one of the Top 10 Hottest Brands in America along with name brands such as Old Spice, M&M’s, iPad and Droid.  Also, Bass Pro Shops has been recognized numerous times for their conservation and outdoor education efforts, as well as being named by J.D. Powers & Associates as one of the top eight retailers in America for customer service excellence. ""With two highly successful partnerships at Vaughan Mills and CrossIron Mills, securing Bass Pro Shops as an anchor tenant was the ideal fit for Ivanhoé Cambridge's newest development. The store's unique design and unforgettable shopping environment are parallel with the shopping experience we are bringing to Niagara-on-the-Lake,"" said David Baffa, Senior Vice President, Retail Development, Central Region, Ivanhoé Cambridge. Bass Pro Shops’ unique, award-winning outdoor stores are known for combining retail with entertainment, conservation and outdoor education. More than just a fishing and hunting store, Bass Pro Shops stores offer equipment and clothing for hiking, backpacking, wildlife viewing, camping, outdoor cooking and more.  A gift and nature center will also serve up a wide variety of outdoor-related items from lamps and dishes to bird feeders and furniture. Their expansive boat showroom will feature Tracker, Nitro, SunTracker, Tahoe, Grizzly and Mako boats built by Tracker Marine Group, the world’s largest manufacturer of fishing boats. Bass Pro Shops’ unique exterior and interior motifs have branded them as visually appealing, high quality outdoor stores. The outdoors feel is brought indoors through massive log and rock work, large indoor aquariums and water features stocked with native fish species as well as an extensive collection of museum quality fish and wildlife mounts.  Historic photos and exhibits will pay tribute to the regions great outdoor heritage."
785274,kickingfrog,2013-05-08 21:19:00,8333,"Something mentioned in the above promotion is the partnerships that go into most of these big shopping complexes. So it's not just fishing conglomerate XYZ wants to build store in town ABC. There is all the ""partners"" that need to be lined up."
785343,Luke V.,2013-05-09 00:57:00,286,This is old news Been underconstruction for the past 6 months I live on the same street they are building it. There goes my bank account lol  But we need a cabellas bad!!!
785345,woodenboater,2013-05-09 01:07:00,2277,"They're calling that NOTL ? please, it's more like St. Kitts if anything. No way NOTL proper would go for BPS, the place is all about tourists and the theatre crowd and ain't no way rod and gun would fit in there lol.  The Hammer woulda been a better place, or Grimsby but NOTL ??? maybe they're going for the American border shopper..."
785348,Luke V.,2013-05-09 01:15:00,286,"It's zoned NOTL it's right beside The main exit for the QEW Perfect location. Stops people from going to the states Sense population with Niagara Falls, NY and Hamilton only 25 mins away"
785350,Nipfisher,2013-05-09 01:21:00,2449,  
785353,craigdritchie,2013-05-09 01:25:00,1586,"Regardless of whether we call it NOTL, St. Kitts or whatever, it still seems an odd location for a store of that size. And why have a second location in southern Ontario that's only an hour from the existing store to begin with? Surely the two locations will compete for many of the same customers.  If I were Johnny Morris and wanted to open another Canadian location, I'd put a store in the Montreal area first. Southern Quebec is a HUGE market for outdoor goods, and they wouldn't have to worry about cannibalizing an existing location by opening up there.  While I will welcome the new store, I don't understand the business case for it. They must be getting one heck of a financial incentive from the developer and perhaps the city to make it worthwhile. Either that, or they will support it by making it a base for the Canadian catalogue operation ... which would make sense, being so close to the US. Who knows."
