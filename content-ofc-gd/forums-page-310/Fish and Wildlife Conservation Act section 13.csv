Now i just saw this interesting youtube clip made this week about the same provision.    Just wondering what has been your experiences when dealing with people who harass you for fishing.  FYI, this is the relevant sections of the Act:   Obstruction of hunting, trapping or fishing 13.  (1) A person shall not interfere with lawful hunting, trapping or fishing by, (a) tampering with traps, nets, bait, firearms or any other thing used for hunting, trapping or fishing; (b ) placing himself or herself in a position, for the purpose of interfering, that hinders or prevents hunting, trapping or fishing; or (c ) engaging in an activity, for the purpose of interfering, that disturbs or is likely to disturb wildlife or fish. 97.  (1) A person who contravenes any provision of this Act or the regulations is guilty of an offence. Penalty 102.  (1) A person convicted of an offence under this Act is liable to a fine of not more than $25,000, to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or to both."

This section has been around for a long time, and I've tried to have a person chrged with it for interfering with a hunt, but the cops wouldn't persuue it, because they'd never heard of it lol.  The person has to pretty much put themselves in your line of fire, or throw rocks at you as your fishing for it to be enforced.  I even tried tried in on the cops for interfering our legal hunt one time. They had no right to be on the property, and absolutly no right to draw guns on us! The swat team was totally un-called for too!  S."
