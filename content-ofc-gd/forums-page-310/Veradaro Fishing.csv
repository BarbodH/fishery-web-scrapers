I was thinking I'd bring my 8wt fly rod along and toss some flies into the surf while I was there. Anyone with experience say yay or nay?  Thanks,  Kemper"

785315,redpearl99,2013-05-08 23:28:00,259,veradero is pretty bad for fishing.  You should try the main bridge at the beginning of the peninsula.  Coyo Coco is much better for fishing
785347,kemper,2013-05-09 01:12:00,2232," I was thinking about that, but I don't have a 4 piece spinning set-up.  My 8 weight breaks down and fits nicely in my suitcase..."

And btw there are far better deals to be had if you go to the charter guys at the docks yourself. So you can fish across the street from your hotel. Other side of the golf course across the highway. There are a ton of small fish you can catch with a hand line and small hooks, I would grab some raw shrimp and squid from the buffet. I was hooking them and casting them out with no luck... But the hand fishing is fun for a few hours. Thee is a local who fishes there every morning. Very nice guy I gave him actin of stuff before I left. Then there is a spot near the mall and the channels. Easy to find them all. Bring a pile of cheap line 5 lb and 1/0 hooks and weights and you will easily make slot of friends with locals."
