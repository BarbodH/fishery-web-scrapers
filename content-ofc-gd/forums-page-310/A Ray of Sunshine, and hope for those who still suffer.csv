785534,quickme,2013-05-09 21:07:00,261,it is very refreshing to hear feel good stories like this.  Very big congrats on such as huge accomplishment.  With what you've gone through the past year and not going astray is another success on its own.  I look forward to a post like this one every year.  Be proud of what you have done!   Nick

785583,mercman,2013-05-10 00:43:00,7054,"Thanks Joey. You are not alone.If you ever feel the urge, and need a reason to fight it, picture a big lad, liver swollen out of proportion, blood trickling from the corners of his mouth,and other places, desperately trying to keep the 6AM beer in his stomach so he could function till noon. That was me girl. It breaks my heart when i think of it now.  Paul"
785593,Roe Bag,2013-05-10 01:44:00,246,"I watched alcohol kill my grandfather. Depression was the root of his troubles. He tried to deal it with booze. A viscious cycle that he could never break. You'll never know how much I wish he could have been the man ""he should have been"". Glad you made it back."
785639,Rich,2013-05-10 11:04:00,3927,"Your story is indeed an inspiration. i have a real good friend who will not come to terms with his alcohol problem. He has three kids and a wife and I see all of them suffer from his addiction, daily. I tried my best to help him out but eventually you have to sit back and hope fate will do the work. So I have essentially refused contact with him until he gets some help. It's sad to have to do that with such a good friend, but I need to get it through his head that his drinking IS a problem, and it is hurting his life."
785642,BITEME,2013-05-10 11:45:00,1968,Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!  Live Long and Prosper  Cheers Peter
785649,woodenboater,2013-05-10 12:34:00,2277,"Congratulations Paul, this is a great story for those still battling the demon bottle. My father in law had serious problems and would often get into heated arguments with my wife over his abuse of said liquor. In the end, it probably lead to his death but he couldn't give up his wine. Think a box of wine before noon type of addiction, it was hard to watch and the family tried their best but you can only do so much.  Thankfully you made the right decision and you now get to share your life with a new partner ! Enjoy your new freedom, it's well earned and deserved."
785671,Beans,2013-05-10 14:34:00,3339, Sometimes tough love may be the answer...mention AA
785672,Beans,2013-05-10 14:39:00,3339," Joey, I don't know how you do it but...you get better lookin' every day"
785696,mercman,2013-05-10 17:17:00,7054,"Thanks so much.....My new Love was married to an active drunk, for 20 years.When i told her i was an alcoholic, she said "" No way !!! You don't drink, how can you be an alcoholic?"" We spent hours shareing on this subject, and one of the reasons we see eye to eye, is because i know what she went through liveing with a drunk, and she knows how i got sober, and why he could not.  He died of alcohol related illness at 44 years old, one year after she left him. You should never feel responsible for an alcoholic drinking. No one and no thing can make an alcoholic stop drinking, but himself.Let his familly know, that they could never have MADE him stop.I reached my bottom before i died, most die before they reach the bottom.  Paul"
785738,Joey,2013-05-10 21:53:00,9122," Thanks Paul, will definately reach out if I have the need.  I have alot of support on the homefront too, so that helps!   Thanks"
784883,mercman,2013-05-07 14:33:00,7054,"I am a 57 year old man, born on May the 8th, 1990. How can this be possible you ask? well, here goes. Tomorrow marks the aniversary on my 23rd year of sobriety.I was, in effect, born on that day, largely thanks to the men and women of Alcoholics Anonymous. On May 8, 1990, i picked up the phone, called A.A. central, and begged for help. Within 45 minutes,a knock at my door signaled a changing day in my life. I opened the door and was greeted by 2 very sober members of A.A. who took me to my first meeting, where i was surrounded by people who knew exactly how i felt. For the first time ever, i was not alone. I'd like to say that life has been smooth and even since that day, but life has twists and turns that we can never predict. Parents die,friends change, relationships rise and fall.....Last year alone, i lost my Mom to Alzheimers, and my wife of 20 years to another man.If i had looked at the rest of my life as a whole, i would have gotten wasted. But, I was taught how to live my life, One Day at a Time, and take myself apart, and put myself back together again, to become the man i was destined to be. I start this new year of my life, a very happy man. I am sober, healthy, and recently,smoke free. At 57, i have met my soulmate too.You know that crazy, silly, feeling that you got when you kissed your first girl or boy? Well, i never had that feeling till January this year.We are buying a house together in June, and i cant imagine spending what life i have left, with antone else. Anyways, i just wanted to mention this once again, as i do every year. For me, the more people i tell i am a recovering alcoholic, the stronger my sobriety gets.For me, being a recovering alcoholic, gives me a sense of pride, and reinforces my will to stay sober. The last time i posted my story, i inspired 2 members to join AA and as far as i know, they are still sober today. Thanks for listening once again, be well, all of you, and thanks for all of your support.  Paul"
784889,bigugli,2013-05-07 14:47:00,6138,Thank you for sharing that Paul.  Many will never come to grips with their alcoholism. Some will forever deny it.. YOur story is a positive testament to life's second chances.
784896,Freshtrax,2013-05-07 15:23:00,2215,"My mother is an alcaholic,  thanks for dealing with it , your friends and family are forever greateful ."
784912,Loonietoon,2013-05-07 16:22:00,1450,Great on you Paul..
784929,mercman,2013-05-07 17:13:00,7054," Thanks a million Kelvin ! How you doin, by the way?"
784935,kickingfrog,2013-05-07 17:45:00,8333,"I didn't know you then, but I know a little about you now. You've helped me out a few times when I've had some issues. Trying to be better is something we should all strive for."
784953,aplumma,2013-05-07 18:48:00,6896,Good reminder Paul congratulations and thanks   Art
784955,SmokestackLightnin,2013-05-07 18:51:00,390,"Congrats on achievements, some demons are hard to kick.  Many have tried and failed."
784963,mr blizzard,2013-05-07 20:05:00,1589,"Paul you after posting this again it shows the steps you took turned you into a leader not a loser, bravo and I have the utmost respect for you. And I mean this in a positve learning experience, my cousin years ago in Sudbury had a few to many before he went to see his wife in the hospital, he never made it there, his wife gave birth to the baby 3 days after she buried her husband.  It is like an infection, it creeps up on u a little at a time and then one day u realize you can take control of your life and enjoy all that life has to offer thru the good times and thru the creativity of molding the negative things into positive ones.  So happy for your new relationship and the continued direction you choose to travel, definitely better than winning the lottery. Your message will touch and positively affect the lives of many, some of which you may never even get to know. Blizz"
784978,mercman,2013-05-07 20:46:00,7054,"Thanks Blizz  Fact is, my new love was married to an active drunk for 8 years. He died at 48 from massive internal leeding from a damaged liver, 1 year after she left him.I see the affects in her young adult children. It binds us together stronger than a normal relationship, because i am aware of the destruction we can do to a familly, and she is aware of the strength and determination it took for me to become me again."
784984,Basskicker,2013-05-07 21:06:00,421,"Congrats on another year of life, another friend of Bill here.  Its amazing how good life gets when you get rid of those demons........the truth will set you free.  Jason"
784999,mercman,2013-05-07 21:45:00,7054,"Thanks Jason. I have allways been open about my drinking.Answered alot of questions too.Latest was my new love asking me if she could kiss me after a glass of wine LOL. i just looked and winked at her and said ""no tongues""  .....I guess when you dont understand the ""disease"", you dont know."
785020,bigbuck,2013-05-07 23:30:00,2449,"Good for you!!!  You have regained control of your life. I've known many folks who were addicted to either alcohol,drugs or gambling and it wasn't a good scene for themselves and their families. None of them did anything about it and many are now gone."
785024,strik,2013-05-07 23:39:00,175,Way to go.  Glad  to hear  things are working out for you.  Good luck  with the house
785028,tb4me,2013-05-07 23:46:00,3295,"Awesome Paul, although I don't know you, im proud of you my man..Your story im sure is inspiration to many keep spreading the great word. Oh and Congrats on the new lady friend.. I wish you both the best!"
785089,Loonietoon,2013-05-08 02:20:00,1450,just taking one day at a time.. it is really hard but we will make it
785101,danc,2013-05-08 02:52:00,4677,You are an inspiration Paul. Keep it up my friend.
785107,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-08 03:23:00,8243,It takes a lot of balls to do what you have done and what you are doing. I am going to forward your post to a dear friend that doesn't think she has hit rock bottom. Rock bottom is the starting point for most addicts. Hopefully if your story changes just one life it's the same as entering a burning building to save a life. But you don't get a medal from some mayor or Governor General. The best part for those such as yourself  that want to help another human being is they don't need a metal or want one.  But you do deserve one.
785109,HTHM,2013-05-08 03:36:00,4082,Happy Birthday!
785112,bassassin,2013-05-08 03:55:00,152,"Inspiring. We go the first 13 to 18 years of our life without willing puting toxins in our system and for many people looking back those are the greatest years of their life! its a very sad dark hole some people willing jump into due to divers reasons but its a very slippery hole to climb back out of, kudos to all of you who have struggled and succeeded and also kudos to those who continue to struggle the juice willl be worth the squeeze!  Hats off to you all, keep hope alive...."
785119,spinnerbaitking,2013-05-08 08:47:00,1622,"Great to see you have another year under your belt, Congrats & Happy Anniversary, keep spreading the Word Tight Lines SBK"
785448,Roe Bag,2013-05-09 14:33:00,246,"You sir are an inspiration.  Much more than just a ""ray of sunshine"". Congrats."
785459,mercman,2013-05-09 15:58:00,7054,"Why Thanks KF !!! Sad fact is, only 1 in 10 are ever able to achieve and maintain sobriety foor any length of time. You can honor the inspiration by keeping in mind, the next time you see a drunk, that it is NOT how he wants to live his life.He is not weak willed or worthless. He is caught up in the denial caused by a horrendous disease,  that is a mental obssesion, followed by a physical compulsion to drink. He probably started out just like anyone else, drinking a couple of drinks to dull the senses, but being a progressive disease, it became necessary to increase the drinking to huge amounts, to dull the same senses. Remove the booze, and he returns to the man or woman that he or she should have been. My drinking almost killed me. I am lucky.... hundreds of thousands are not.  Paul"
785471,vance,2013-05-09 17:04:00,719,"Well Paul you have had a few lows in your life but you climbed out of them and you have succeeded when most probably thought you were a goner,My hats off too you!!!!!!!!!!!!  vance"
785531,Joey,2013-05-09 20:46:00,9122,"Congrats Paul.  As you know I also struggle with that Demon, but am sober myself and loving life right now.  Keep up the good fight buddy and I'm glad things are looking up for you.  Enjoy it!!!"
