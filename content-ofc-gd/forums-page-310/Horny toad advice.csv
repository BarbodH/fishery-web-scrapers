785458,snagged,2013-05-09 15:55:00,67,"Which horny toad frogs are u guys using. I bought a pack of triggerX frogs and although the quality is good, they preformed horribly. They don't swim straight and constantly twist and turn (roll upsidedown). I read similar reviews so I know I'm not alone. Lets hear some recommendations.  Thx"
785460,mercman,2013-05-09 16:00:00,7054,"Have you tried rigging them on a weighted swimbait hook? They should swim right side up that way, at least."
785461,musky_hunter,2013-05-09 16:07:00,328,I like zoom but it's important to use a plastic bullet weight infront.  http://zoombait.com/2010/12/better-hook-ups-with-a-horny-toad/
785462,snagged,2013-05-09 16:13:00,67,"That would fix the right side up issue but the action on the legs is another story. Feels more like ur dragging the frog vs swimming it. I've heard good things about the zoom, I'll definitely give them a try this year. Any other suggestions?"
785483,Lape0019,2013-05-09 17:48:00,647,"I use Stanley ribbit's. they work pretty good weightless but I usually use a swim bait weighted hook as well.   I read a review on tackletour a few years ago about the sizemic toads and they seem to be pretty nice. I was going to buy these instead but the Stanley's are the only ones my tackle shop carried. On the plus side, the ribbit's just plain work."
785486,young_one,2013-05-09 17:48:00,620,"Shhhh.... they don't work! Owner TwistLock Center Pin 5/0, Original Zoom Horny Toad, colours are confusing, I stick with white or black."
785506,Garfisher,2013-05-09 19:12:00,229,"Powerbait Chigger Toads work pretty well. I don't weight the hook myself, allows for a slow retrieve which works fine"
785571,aplumma,2013-05-09 23:29:00,6896,Ribbits are the bomb. They even have a special twin hook weighted and unweighted to make sure they work correctly.   Art
785606,Wolf 3,2013-05-10 02:15:00,134," When you rig these soft plastic frogs ""weightless"" you have to make sure the hook point is dead center.  This will ensure that they run straight.  I like the Gambler Cane Toad."
785657,MCTFisher9120,2013-05-10 12:58:00,3761," Shhh, Stanley doesn't make hooks  In all seriousness use good braid, a double hook and your set. I like the Mann's Hard Nose Frog's myself when doing the boring cast and crank...Slop frog's is where it's at."
785660,mattybculp,2013-05-10 13:22:00,388,"I Really like the zoom product, I use the hook with the attachment where you can either screw on your bait or the one I prefer is the one you can push the head of the bait up. I fish it weightless and love it. However nothing is as good as real frogs. awwww to remember the good ol' days "" i'll take 5 dozen """
785687,Fang,2013-05-10 16:11:00,1330,Gambler Cane Toads and Ugly Otters for me Use them both for top water and flippin
785804,snagged,2013-05-11 02:32:00,67,Imma grab me some Stanley ribbits. I watched the videos and they look great.
785887,EC1,2013-05-11 16:42:00,930,"Garry2r's posted an in-depth tutorial for this a year or two ago on this forum. If you find it, read it and you will have a great time fishing it.  I've had good luck with the Sizmic toads, and at their price it's wonderful."
