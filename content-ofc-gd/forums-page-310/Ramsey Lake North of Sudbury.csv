785862,mr blizzard,2013-05-11 13:49:00,1589,"The only Ramsey lake I know of is in Sudbury, thats where my mom for the most part grew up after moving from n bay, I will check with my cousins there, sit tight."
785863,hammer swinger,2013-05-11 13:52:00,7,"The latest I can give you is from April 29, we have a trip booked into Indian Lake in 2 weeks, very close to Ramsey. Outfitter said ice was starting break up, hard to say how it has progressed without knowing temps and precip. I think it would be a couple weeks behind this year, but I do not know the area well enough. Hope your buddy hits it right"
785866,mr blizzard,2013-05-11 14:05:00,1589,"Just called my cousin, Ramsey Lake in Sudbury itself is open, the lakes between Sudbury and Timmins he was not sure about, hope it is some help."
785867,mr blizzard,2013-05-11 14:06:00,1589,Should not have any issues
785874,chris.brock,2013-05-11 15:59:00,4053,"satellite pics show Ramsey, Bisco., Indian have been open for awhile (no ice)  post a report when you get back, I would love to read it"
785884,mcdougy,2013-05-11 16:23:00,274,Ice has been out for a little while now. water levels higher and water temps cooler than normal. Have a friend working in Sudbury and he has been fishing alot. He and locals are agreeing that the bite has not turned on quite yet. But it sure is fun to fish!!!!
785885,spinnerbaitking,2013-05-11 16:31:00,1622,"Thanx Guys, He said Ramsey is maybe 75 miles north of Sudbury, sounds like he's going up with a Trailer & staying a couple of weeks, he has a phone number for some one up there but isn't able to find it, case of Sometimers I told him lol, I'll pass the Info on to him, anymore comments & I'll keep him informed, I think they mostly target Pike but I'm not positive. Thanx & Tight Lines SBK"
