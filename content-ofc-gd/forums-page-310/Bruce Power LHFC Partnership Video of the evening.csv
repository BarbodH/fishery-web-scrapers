785912,Twocoda,2013-05-11 20:48:00,4130,Bruce Power are trying to BUY friends so there is no resistance to putting in the Nuclear Waste Dump...something i find very disturbing considering the location of the perspective site and the effects it could have on Lake Huron if and when something should go wrong 40 million people drink from that lake in two countries... shortsightedness for a few jobs isnt worth it ....
785923,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-11 22:03:00,8243,"Twocoda you are exactly right.  Is anyone so nieve to think a corporation would spend a single penny if it didn't have to? It's called being good corporate neighbours. We have the same thing going on down here with the windfarm under construction.  First they cut down an eagles nest to put up 3 windmills 600 meters from my home then brag that they put up 6 nests and 1 has been occupied by a nesting couple as well they have donated the nest they pulled down to the school board. I'd love to know where they came across 6 eagle nests? I know, they cut them down somewhere else. How stupid do they think we are?  If I were the fishing club in Huron I would tell them to go pound salt, but then again Bruce Power peaced them off with a dinner including desert. Now if they want to donate some real money we can talk.  I asked Samsung to build us a boat ramp on the shore of their 55 windmill Nextel project and was told it is under consideration, that was a year ago."

There was 98 People at the Meeting Announcement & yes the meal was very good & something they offered as we only have a Dinner meeting for Christmas. Tight Lines SBK"
785932,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-11 23:20:00,8243,"Spinner,  I know it's better than receiving zero. But the money you are talking is far less than they would spend on 1 corporate junket on a private jet to Bermuda for 1 weekend, far less. Don't be na√Øve."
