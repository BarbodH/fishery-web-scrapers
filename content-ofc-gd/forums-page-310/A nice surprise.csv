785293,Christopheraaron,2013-05-08 22:30:00,3525,"A couple days ago I emailed a few local taxidermists to see if I could have any scrap fur, at about 10pm I got an email from one of them back, he said that he had bits and pieces of deer and bear. He said he was also a fireman and so he's leave them at the station for me to pick up. So I swung by today expecting a ziplock of small skin patches, it ended up to be way more than I could ever hope for, I got 2 backs, a belly, and a nice sized patch of bear!    Always pays to ask!"

785333,bare foot wader,2013-05-09 00:07:00,1354,"hmm...I wonder if I email a taxidermist up in NWT if I'd score any polar bear or arctic fox?..ha  that's a lot of material right there, I'm guessing we're going to see a follow up thread with a bunch of spun deer hair for bass opener, mice, frogs, dahlbergs and such?"
