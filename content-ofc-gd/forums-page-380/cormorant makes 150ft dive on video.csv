719553,woodenboater,2012-08-02 02:50:00,2277,christ that bird has some set of lungs !
719554,backbay,2012-08-02 02:54:00,773,"Gosh, they don't get the bends by doing that?"
719557,kickingfrog,2012-08-02 02:57:00,8333,The bends aren't an issue if you don't breath under water.
719566,Muskieman,2012-08-02 03:21:00,2472,"They can dive to more than 90 meters, no lake is safe ."
719576,backbay,2012-08-02 03:58:00,773," Makes sense! Still unreal that they can do that, with the pressure and all. Doesn't make me like them anymore than I did!"
719579,Pickeral eater,2012-08-02 04:10:00,155,Hate em. They are reeking havoc everywhere they colonize.  Any chance the ministry will open a season on them?
719629,Christopheraaron,2012-08-02 13:28:00,3525," Yummm, gobie rich meat!"
719637,jedimaster,2012-08-02 14:02:00,3472,"Not the same kind of cormorant as we are having issues with here. I believe we have double crested, but I would need to check that out to be sure. Eitherway thats pretty amazing. I have often though about what it would like it if someone hooked up a go pro to a loon."
719650,kickingfrog,2012-08-02 14:59:00,8333,"Ya different spieces. Both loons and cormarants are believed to dive more then the 150ft that this one did. But the ""on-board"" camera was a neet birds eye view (sorry I couldn't help myself) and the eating at depth was previously unknown."
719656,Joey,2012-08-02 15:34:00,9122,"Wow, now that was a pretty cool video, thanks for sharing.  Like em or hate em, that was pretty impressive.  Maybe we should do as the Asians do and teach them to fish for us for perch or other small fish (smelt?).   They have taught them and I've seen the videos and they are pretty neat.  Maybe I'll get me a cormorant and train him"
719658,misfish,2012-08-02 15:46:00,29133, You dont need one J. You have Paul already trained.LOL   Cool vid.
