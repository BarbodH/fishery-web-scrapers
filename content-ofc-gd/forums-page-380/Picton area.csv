720133,fishindevil,2012-08-04 08:53:00,6254,There is a great resident population of walleyes in the bay !!!! Hay bay is a great spot as well as Mohawk bay !!!! Drift or troll along the weed flats or drift over them !!!!! Twister tails and a jig or worm harness even a #7 shad rap will do the trick !!!!!! If you are gonna use live bait bring lots small perch and the gobies will rob you alot !!!!!
