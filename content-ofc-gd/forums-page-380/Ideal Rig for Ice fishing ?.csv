Im after a trophy perch this year.  Im looking at getting a 4 wheeler and a small clam style shanty.  What would be the best 4 wheeler for the job ? I have been told a smaller 2wd is the best so if you get stuck, its easy to move out.  But I think a 4wd would be the best option, no ?"
719382,BillM,2012-08-01 14:33:00,17367,"If it's strictly for icefishing, I'd pick a snowmobile..  If you are going to pick a 4wheeler, definitely 4wd..   I've used both out on the ice, the only time the 4wheeler really struggles is when there's a lot of snow or a lot of slush..  They tend to sink compared to a snowmobile in the same conditions.  When you get into back lake icefishing, snowmobile hands down."
719389,adempsey,2012-08-01 15:01:00,1498,"Ask here or hereand you'll get plenty of information.  I think your choice may depend on where you fish.   However, in my experience, there seem to be a lot more ice fishermen with ATV's than sleds on the bigger lakes.   For back lakes, I think what Bill said is true.  I still use my two feet, so I can't offer much more than that."
719393,crappieperchhunter,2012-08-01 15:10:00,2582,I have neither so I can offer no help. Actually the main reason I have neither...other then I'm cheap  ...is I just can't decide which way to go myself.
719402,Lunker777,2012-08-01 15:49:00,866,Mostly Lake St.Clair.... but I want to make a few weekend trips to quinte/simcoe/nipissing.  Im thinking a good 4x4 ATV is what I am after.... it can be used YEAR round and they are a little more my style. We dont get much snow for sledding around here so a skidoo wouldn't get nearly the same amount of use.
719510,wallyboss,2012-08-02 00:08:00,1095,If you choose a Quad make sure it's 4X4 and get kick ass tires for it. Standard tires are useless once you get in a foot of snow.
719518,Joeytier,2012-08-02 00:54:00,3990,4x4 atv (smallest you can get away with)...chains if you experience deep snow (rare on simcoe) and you're good to go!
