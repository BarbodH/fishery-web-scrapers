719323,danc,2012-08-01 04:00:00,4677,"Almost exactly a year ago I switched jobs, for personal reasons. The guy that I worked for a year ago (and for 13 years before that) is very succesful, loves his fishing, and owns a float plane or two. Yesterday I got an email from him asking if I'd like to do an Albany river fly in with him in a few weeks. Damn. That sounds like fun. Although he's a hard guy to work for, we've always had a mutual respect for each other. Especially when it comes to fishing. I've done a fly in to the Albany with him before, about 10 years ago. In fact, of the hundreds of people that he has employed over the time that I worked for him, I'm the only employee that he invited to fly north with him. It was awesome. So I'm a bit flattered here. Albany River Walleyes, Albany River trib Specks, and a jaunt to the most beautiful lake I've ever seen in my lifetime, for Lakers. You'd swear that you were in Hawaii when fishing this lake. Emerald blue/green water with white sand beaches and water where you can see 30 feet down. And Lakers one after another. Not big. 3 to 4 lbs. average, although he caught back to back 15 lb. fish last time I was there with him. So, I think I'm gonna take him up on his offer. I just have to get through this weekend first. Heading to western Minnesota tomorrow morning for 4 days of Country music fun. With any luck, I'll stumble into a party or two while I'm there.    Damn, but life is good.  "

719341,Fish Farmer,2012-08-01 10:33:00,2234,"Good old toe tappin music and a flyin to-boot, don't get any better than that."
719346,Spiel,2012-08-01 11:24:00,9065," I fly in, run with that Bud, sounds way too good to turn down."
719348,mercman,2012-08-01 11:35:00,7054,"Dan ....You must be doing something right in this life. Those are some of my fav Country singers . That and the fishin?........Do it Man !!!!! Enjoy, and write up a good report when you get back."
719351,i2cool2fool,2012-08-01 12:00:00,349,"Enjoy. Be prepared for any awkward ""I love you man"" or ""please come back"" discussions. Unless, of course, you are open the idea. Suppose that could be a possibility?"
719371,Oryx,2012-08-01 13:38:00,186,"Have a great time, glad to hear no bridges were burned when the career change happened."
719565,Nipfisher,2012-08-02 03:21:00,2449,Fishing sounds good Dan. From what I can remember........I had a great time on my last trip to Minnesota. One of my best buds played NCAA Div. 2 baseball and golf at Bemidji State.  Actually we went to South Dakota to a country music festival called We-Fest. Was an increddible lineup and Tim McGraw announced his engagement to Faith Hill at the concert and they did a duet. Good times.
