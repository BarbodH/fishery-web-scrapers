719698,Fisherman,2012-08-02 18:50:00,7201,12V
719700,jedimaster,2012-08-02 18:55:00,3472,"Yep 12v, you can adjust the amperage if thats available as an option... the lower the amperage the longer it will take, but will generally give you a deep charge."
719704,addy79,2012-08-02 19:00:00,573,"12V it is, thanks guys.  Is there any other maintenance you can do to a marine battery if its been in storage for about a year?"
719715,davey buoy,2012-08-02 19:35:00,5505," Make sure it's a auto charger! The manual may overcharge?,be carefull."
