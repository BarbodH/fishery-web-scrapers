719408,Lunker777,2012-08-01 16:07:00,866,Im thinking about taking a few days this fall to do some fishing.  I want to hit up Simcoe forsure for some trophy smallies. Then possibly Quinte for some Eyes. Of course I will be hitting the home waters of LSC and hopefully Erie.  If you had ONE WEEK of vacation to take between now and the end of September or October... when would you take it ?  Thanks
719414,BillM,2012-08-01 16:20:00,17367,Around Thanksgiving...  My fav time to hit the French.
719602,outllaw,2012-08-02 12:08:00,1232,lunker. if its muskies lsc the week of halloween.
719603,Rizzo,2012-08-02 12:11:00,4754,we take a few days the last week of October for musky fishing and it hasn't disappointed yet
719608,mike rousseau,2012-08-02 12:17:00,4661,"Depends on water temps....lol  I know in my area...  Smallies go crazy in September....  Musky go crazy mid sept to the end of October....  And walleye here are getting into full swing now and it just gets better till christmas...  As for quinte walleye.... From what I can tell... The later the better.... October may still be early for ""great"" quinte fishing..."
719612,Lunkerhunter,2012-08-02 12:34:00,455,"mike is right, october will prob be too early for quinte.  last week of october was good for me on LSC last year. and simcoe is hot around then as well..  i would say end of october for sure"
719692,Lunker777,2012-08-02 18:11:00,866,"Im not to worried about the musky , I want to catch a trophy small mouth !  End of October is pretty well a no go for me. Its getting to the end of harvest season and the start of the busy season in the world of AG sales.  Thanks for the tips guys"
719843,Toad Hunter,2012-08-03 02:53:00,261,"This year, would be hard to tell with the weather we've had... but I prefer Late Sept.- October is very productive too, but I find the weather is less predictable and cold fronts can move in and cold rain with it can kill a trip pretty fast for those afraid to brave the elements. (or for people like myself in a little tin rocket, fighting swalls is no picnic either)"
719847,Fang,2012-08-03 03:58:00,1330,For big smallies keep an eye on Erie starting mid September. It's probably better mid October but loads of 4's and 5's are possible out of eastern end.
719862,Cudz,2012-08-03 06:59:00,2652,Big smallies on Simcoe Oct 27th -Nov 23rd
719888,Billy Bob,2012-08-03 12:47:00,5865,For the best pounds of fish per effort......SEPTEMBER for Lake Erie PERCH.
719913,Cudz,2012-08-03 13:54:00,2652,Sounds tempting after seeing the mules you were catching but I don't think perch made his wish list.
719924,Billy Bob,2012-08-03 14:18:00,5865,Lake Erie was on his list so I thought it was worth mentioning...
719927,mike rousseau,2012-08-03 14:28:00,4661,If erie wasn't so dam far.... I'd come fish perch with ya Bob
719934,Billy Bob,2012-08-03 14:48:00,5865," Anytime........April, May then Sept and early Oct....."
719983,Lunker777,2012-08-03 17:14:00,866,     If the perch are anything like the ones you are catchin BB.... Ill be all over it. I have a grandpa that I said I would get out for some perch fishing this year and the usual spots around this side of lake Erie ARENT producing didely squat !!!  I would love to get into a school of jumbos ! haha

720006,craigdritchie,2012-08-03 18:33:00,1586,First two weeks of November are usually the best time for just about everything.
