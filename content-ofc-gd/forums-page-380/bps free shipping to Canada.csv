719746,kickingfrog,2012-08-02 20:42:00,8333,Bass Pro has a promo on right now for free shipping on orders over $75 (I assume US dollars) to Canada. Check before you buy because duty and taxes are still due.
719792,Ralph Field,2012-08-02 23:38:00,1018,Do they pay the brokerage fees?
719796,Woodsman,2012-08-02 23:56:00,1286,If they ship by USPS you should be fine. If by courier bend over as you order & wait for the shafting.
719798,Wolf 3,2012-08-02 23:59:00,134," From BPS website, ""Canadian orders will be charged a $3.50 brokerage fee, duty and tax."""
719807,mercman,2012-08-03 00:48:00,7054,"With all the great places to buy tackle and fishing related articles locally and in Canada, i cant for the life of me understand why anyone would place an order there.I know i wont again. 1 pair Cargo shorts 32.95 1 ripstop expandable pockets shirt, 29.95 total invoices 128.98 Never ever again.Total rip off. And worse...the clothing was manufactured  here in Quebec."
719984,largemouthtrout,2012-08-03 17:16:00,53,"OK ... I don,t get this at all .  Theres a BassProShop in Vaughan ( Toronto ) ... I,m pretty sure Toronto is still in Canada .  Why are you ordering from BassPro in the States ?"
719986,Luke V.,2012-08-03 17:19:00,286,"When you order online, it comes from the US. Doesnt matter that there are stores in Canada. US based company only ships product for online orders from the US."
719988,kickingfrog,2012-08-03 17:31:00,8333, Not everything on-line is in the store and it costs me about $20 in gas and about an hour and a half in time.
719989,Oryx,2012-08-03 17:31:00,186,can you not use the ship to store feature?
719991,Luke V.,2012-08-03 17:35:00,286,"When you click on the ship to store feature, it gives you a list of only the US stores. I don't know why but that how it goes"
719993,largemouthtrout,2012-08-03 17:39:00,53,"Interesting ... I wonder if you called the actual store in Vaughan on the phone , and gave them the product number of what you wanted , if they would ship you one direct from their store ? ... might be worth trying .  It would be kinda like if you were at the store and wanted something that they were out of stock on .. they will order it in and call you when it arrives . Never know .. they might ."
719994,Luke V.,2012-08-03 17:43:00,286,That may be worth a try. You just never know.
720025,glen,2012-08-03 19:47:00,2641,"""And worse...the clothing was manufactured here in Quebec.""  That is bad.   You try an order first them let us know how it is working."
720135,Spiel,2012-08-04 10:57:00,9065, I have and they did.
