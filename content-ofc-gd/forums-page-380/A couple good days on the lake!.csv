I posted last week asking about where to buy leeches for a decent price. On Gaspumper’s recommendation I went to Marion’s in Havelock. It’s a great little bait shop with a good selection and good prices. The woman running the place was very friendly. I really like little places like this as opposed to Canada Tire, BPS etc. Thanks for the tip Gaspumper! Onto the fishing. I caught these two Smallies and countless other small ones fishing leeches on bottom around submerged rock piles. Unfortunately the Walleye were nowhere to be found.         I got all the Largies on a green pumpkin flipping jig and trailer in shallow areas with a mix of stumps and weeds.      I saw this guy swim under a stump right in front of the dock so I grabbed a rod and pitched a jig right in front of him, he chomped it up right away         Also caught a couple little Pike and Perch but didn’t take any pics of them. Cheers guys,  -Ben"
