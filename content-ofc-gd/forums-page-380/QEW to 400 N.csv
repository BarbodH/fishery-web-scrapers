719732,GreenCanada,2012-08-02 20:00:00,375,I just take the QEW to 403 to 401 E to 400 N. Never takes me long unless it is during rush hour.

719745,woodenboater,2012-08-02 20:41:00,2277,"I don't think 680 has aerial traffic all day, just am and pm rush. I think they do like everyone else during the day, RESCU and MTO traffic cameras  that and caller reports  speaking of which, I understand Apple is smart and thinking of leveraging their user base in conjunction with the Tom Tom traffic app for real time, up to date traffic conditions."
719804,chris.brock,2012-08-03 00:44:00,4053,"if you look at a map, QEW- 427- 401- 400 is the most direct, I use this route alot, that time of day you'll be ok  like Solo mentioned, I too would like to hear more about your Flindt Landing fishing trip. Sounds like the train is fun. What's the cost of the train? How much gear do they allow on the train?"
719963,seanik,2012-08-03 15:52:00,38,"Thanks to Everyone for all the advice on getting to the 400, This is the 2nd yr for Flindt Landing Camp, Heathcote is a classic Western , Ont lake with many Islands and continuess rock faces. heathcote is 17 miles long and only 1/2 mile wide. The water is tannin stained which results in an almost black colored Walleye. A worm harness with a crawler trolled in 12-15' caught many 16-20"" walleyes each AM. There are only 4 cabins on Heathcote Lake which is part of the Wabakimi provincial park and can only be reached by train , a fly in or paddle in by canoe or kayak. The Flindt Landing website spells out the history and whats offered at the camp and based on my expierence last year, what is stated is what you get and more. The train trip from Capreol (near Sudbury) to Flindt Landing takes about 18hrs and the cost for senior economy coach is about 254.00 round trip. We preferred a sleeper berth with meals because if the train is full it's a long tough trip for us old timers. We waited out via rail for their discount sale and booked a sleeper berth with meals for 472.00 round trip. The baggage allowance is very generous, each person is allowed 3 checked bags and 2 carry ons, the checked bags can weigh up to 50 lbs and be 4' long and they really don't adhere strickly to the weight limit. The meals are high quality, a great observation car and club car are available for your use. Via rail's website is very informative and trips can be booked on it. I will post a report on this years Flindt Landing trip upon returning.  Seanik"

719015,seanik,2012-07-31 12:42:00,38,"I am asking for some current information and advice on getting from the QEW to 400 North not using the 407 ETR. We will be going through Toronto Thursday Aug.9 at about 11:00Am and traveling to Capreol, Ont. and boarding Via Rail for an 18 hr train trip to Flindt Landing Lodge in the Wabakimi Park. We did this trip last year with great fishing results but the train was most enjoyable. Is there a good alternate route to the 400 N avoiding the tolls?  Seanik"
719023,Terry,2012-07-31 12:53:00,14456,"qew to 427 north 401 east 400 north is how I go  dang, beat me by that much...lol"
719025,BillM,2012-07-31 13:00:00,17367,"The 427 is crap, I don't think they've done road maintenance to that thing for 20 years..  I'd take QEW/403/401/400N.."
719028,Fish4Eyes,2012-07-31 13:03:00,1022,"Anywhere between 10-11:00am you will be okay getting to 400, assuming there are no lane restrictions due to collisions. Not sure where you are leaving from but it sounds like Hamilton/Niagara area. Take QEW and then 403E. You can ride the carpool lane all the way to the 401 which increases your odds of not being delayed. Once you are on 401E, the 400N ramp is not far. If by chance you notice the 401E is busy, take 427N to 409E, then 409E to 401E. You will merge back onto 401E about 1km west of the 400N ramp, so make sure you are in the far right lane to be able to safely access the ramp. Keep an eye out for the large overhead electronic message signs for traffic delays."
719032,Christopheraaron,2012-07-31 13:24:00,3525,QEW- 401-400 or QEW-427-401-400 first option would be your best bet.
719036,Terry,2012-07-31 13:42:00,14456, is this the route you drive your car
719041,adempsey,2012-07-31 13:53:00,1498,"The 427 is just fine south of the 401.  Either route mentioned should be good (QEW-403E-401E-400N  OR QEW-427N-401E-400N), especially at 11AM on a weekday.  I'd probably go with the 403E route with the carpool lane, as long as you have at least three people in the car.  Taking the 409 MIGHT help a bit if it's busy, but I've only gone that route when it's really bad STOP-AND-GO traffic.  I don't think it saves much time, just some frustration.  I'd probably stay in the Express lane on the 401 as well to make things easier, but the collectors might be faster if you really need to save 5 minutes, lol."
719046,farsider,2012-07-31 14:01:00,456," Are you referring to the last three years of maintenance which is still ongoing or the three more years still to come?  Also, total travel time between QEW and 401 at 11:00 am would be like four minutes.  How ""crap"" could that be? Cheers, Mark"
719052,BillM,2012-07-31 14:18:00,17367," You must actually work on the road crew to be defending the 427, lol!  The 403/401 route is 100% better."
719061,cram,2012-07-31 14:39:00,1733,"427 is fine (crap??), but 403 to 401 is faster."
719067,kickingfrog,2012-07-31 14:49:00,8333,No it isn't.
719068,kickingfrog,2012-07-31 14:49:00,8333,Yes it is.
719070,BillM,2012-07-31 14:50:00,17367,^--- LOL!
719088,Fisherman,2012-07-31 15:42:00,7201,It's evident that opinions about personal road travel and directions are as rampant as those who think they are good drivers.
719089,cram,2012-07-31 15:43:00,1733,"Okay - let me clarify.  The 427 is not a wasteland road from a mad max movie. 99% of travelers wouldn't notice the ""lack of maintenance"" you're referring to.  In terms of driving distance, they're about the same. 403 has potential to be faster because you avoid the downtown toronto traffic."

719172,BillM,2012-07-31 19:13:00,17367,   Yup..... you missed it.
719174,Raf,2012-07-31 19:16:00,3495,"427 from QEW to 401 will be fast than 403.  the latter winds around, the former is a drag strip."
719176,solopaddler,2012-07-31 19:19:00,8605," Okay that made me laugh.  Anyhow mid morning you'll be fine using either of the routes mentioned, although I do believe QEW-427-401 TO 400 is the fastest.  I'm much more interested in your trip. How about a report on Flindt Landing when you return?  Over the years I've done several canoe trips in that immediate vicinity getting dropped off along the tracks west of Armstrong.  I agree the train is fantastic, but man is it ever expensive! I'd use it all the time if I could afford to.  Cheers"
