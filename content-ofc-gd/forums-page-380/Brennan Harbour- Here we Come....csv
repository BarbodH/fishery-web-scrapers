Brennan Harbour resort.   The place looks good, and the fishing sounds good...but who really know. Wondering if anyone has been there, and what their expeiences were? Fish the harbours or the spanish river, what worked for you....any advice is appreciated.  I'll provide a full report when we get back...    Hammer"
719107,solopaddler,2012-07-31 16:21:00,8605,"You'll love it up there. If it's walleye you're after fish the harbour. Typical structure (shoals, points, windblown shorelines) with 20' give or take being the magic depth.  Troll worm harnesses and boucers to find them then switch to jigs.  Would love to see a report when you return!"
719144,adempsey,2012-07-31 17:44:00,1498,"I'd also like to hear about how the accommodations, boats etc and fishing are.  I'd considered that resort many times over the years, but never been.  Good luck!"
