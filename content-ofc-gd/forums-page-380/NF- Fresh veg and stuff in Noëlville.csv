Good place to stop if one is staying on the West Arm or Wolseley Bay and don't want to make the drive to Sturgeon Falls.  Got some corn there which was great and everything else looked really good as well. The Foodland is not going to notice anything but it's a nice alternative for some Ont grown produce. Missed the farmers market at the arena (?) as it only runs from 10-1 pm on Saturday."
719674,Rod Caster,2012-08-02 16:45:00,5784,"Absolutely! My bro lives out there now and basically gets all the sustenance he needs from the local farms. Eggs, cows, chicken, bison, veggies, berries, its all there. I've actually put some effort into buying local around north bay as well.... Lots of farms in the satelite villages"
719681,lew,2012-08-02 17:17:00,12766,We always take a run into Noelville during our trips to Lakair so we'll check out the new vegetable place next week. I actually got gas at that ESSO in June but didn't notice it then.
719684,Musky or Specks,2012-08-02 17:33:00,2710,I'm on the road daily for my job in the KW area. This time of the year I live on fresh produce from our Ontario farmers. Buying it from stands at the end of their driveways often on the honour system.

719689,woodenboater,2012-08-02 17:57:00,2277,"Easy to miss Joey and Lew. It's tucked inside the old bay and if yer pulling in for gas from 64, you pass right by it while heading for the pumps. Took me a few seconds to figure out why the garage looked different"
