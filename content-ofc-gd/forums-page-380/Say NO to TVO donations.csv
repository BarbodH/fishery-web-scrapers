The tax payer funded organization, which is supposed to be available to all Ontarians, is telling its viewers ""get a dish or buy cable"".  TVO had plenty of lead time to deal with the analog spectrum of TV signals disappearing, and maybe respond in an imaginative or the intelligent way in which they like to portray themselves.  Yet they just decided to hunker down in their Yonge St. Toronto offices and tell their viewers to spend more money.  I watch TV on an antenna. If I can't watch it, I'm not paying for it. Maybe TVO has outlived any usefulness it once had and should be dismantled. Remember this during their next fund raising drive - if you are able to see it!"
