720021,Moosebunk,2012-08-03 19:33:00,3970,Doods!?!?!?  Got some videos to pop into an upcoming report that I'll wanna feed here from YouTube.  How do I make it so that the video screen pops up into the report to play/watch it on the OFC page... and not just have it link people off site?  Thanks.

720027,solopaddler,2012-08-03 19:48:00,8605,"Looking forward to the report bud. Before posting scroll down to the bottom and click on ""click to configure post options"".  You'll have 4 options to choose from, pick ""HTML On-Auto Linebreak Mode"""
720028,fishnsled,2012-08-03 19:49:00,3520,"How do I embed a video Click the embed icon under the video. It will bring up the file..right click and copy. On OFC... use the Full Editor... down on the lower left there is a ""click to configure post options"". Click that... and under post options turn on HTML Auto. Paste your video embed file into the post... then hit Add reply.   Looking forward to the report!"

720068,Moosebunk,2012-08-03 22:26:00,3970,"Right on fellas!!!  All this to chew on will certainly help.  After I plow through these next 3 nightshifts I hope to get up sometime on Monday and pop up a Kesagami Report.  Took 4 videos and wanted to add them in with the pics.  Thanks guys.    And Brian... Don't you just love that tune???  Gawd, I do.  That beat is like my ""Going Fishin'"" song I hum when touring up the lake. Ha!"
