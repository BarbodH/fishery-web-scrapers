719540,kickingfrog,2012-08-02 01:55:00,8333,I guess I spent too much time squeezing bullfrogs as a kid.
719580,crappieperchhunter,2012-08-02 04:12:00,2582, A big thank you Terry for helping out    And you too Brian   I hope people enjoy it.
719142,crappieperchhunter,2012-07-31 17:42:00,2582,We have a swampy area behind our cottage...Lotsa turtles both painted and snappers and tons of frogs. One frog is huge....way bigger then all the rest around. Our neighbor has named him King.  King doesn't like getting picked up and he will become very vocal when he is handled. I have caught tons of frogs in my life but I have never heard one anywhere near as loud as this guy. The first time my neighbor caught him I thought there was an angry cat in the yard somewhere. You could probably hear him from a football field distance away.  Anyway my daughter took this video with her phone when they where up earlier this year. That's my wife Debbe with King. My neighbor calls her the frog whisperer because she is always hunting down frogs when our grandson Lucas is up for a visit.  I hope the video works and you folks get a kick out of our King.    Edit...A big thx to Brian & Terry for loading the video for me. Terry has posted it further down in this thread.
719146,crappieperchhunter,2012-07-31 17:45:00,2582,Well I can see it didn't work. And I have no clue how to get the video on here.

719156,d_paluch,2012-07-31 18:21:00,343,Reading this thread on my phone....read the title as 'kick the frog'  I was waiting for either a new fishing technique or cruelty to animals Haha  Dont mind me....Carry on
719165,NAW,2012-07-31 19:03:00,4022,"Hope you figure out how to post a video.  You've peaked my interest.  I still haven't figured out how to post video either.  Aside from uploading to U Tube, then posting a link to that."
719170,davey buoy,2012-07-31 19:10:00,5505,"Well there you go crappie,you tube and let's see this KING. lol."
719202,Rod Caster,2012-07-31 20:18:00,5784,I thought for sure this was going to be about Kickingfrog pledging his allegience to his King
719210,Joey,2012-07-31 20:26:00,9122," Try again, I'd like to see it.  You have to host the video on youtube or Flickr, then you can link it through the hyperlink icon above."
719211,misfish,2012-07-31 20:33:00,29133,Photo bucket is very easy to use as well.    
719247,kickingfrog,2012-07-31 22:28:00,8333," That is how I read it on my phone as well. My first thought was ""What the heck did I do?"""

719280,kickingfrog,2012-08-01 00:41:00,8333,Wasn't there a giant frog from Africa that was banned from frog jumping contests?

719484,woodenboater,2012-08-01 21:15:00,2277,absolutely the last sound I thought I'd hear coming out of a frog's mouth. sounded like a crying baby or a whiney Steve Urkel
719492,misfish,2012-08-01 21:50:00,29133,"Thats cool.  I tried Steve,but had to hand it off to the master.  Thanks buddy."
719493,Beans,2012-08-01 21:52:00,3339,"What a wonderful bird the frog are...  Whata wonderful bird the frog are! When he stand he sit almost; When he hop he fly almost. He ain't got no sense hardly; He ain't got no tail hardly either. When he sit, he sit on what he ain't got almost.       Great post Steve...  "
719494,adempsey,2012-08-01 21:58:00,1498,"Lol, that was just weird."
719524,Joey,2012-08-02 01:28:00,9122,"Okay, that was freaky, never thought that was the sound that would come out of a frog, pretty cool"
