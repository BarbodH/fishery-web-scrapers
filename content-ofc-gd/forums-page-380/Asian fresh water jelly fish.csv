I have not seen these yet but will be on the look-out. Not sure what the effect of the lake would be. Anyone else seen these?"
719585,largemouthtrout,2012-08-02 05:07:00,53,"had me nervous for a second there after watching a program on ( box jellyfish )  looked up what you described ... they are actually quite common ... and pretty much harmless to people . might irritate someone with sensitive skin . heres the link to what I found http://www.soe-townsville.org/freshwaterjellyfish/  They seem to like to feed on mosquito larva ... so they can,t be all that bad ."

They won't harm anything in the ecosystem (except unsuspecting daphnia and copepods), they just go along their business very quietly."
