719749,misfish,2012-08-02 20:52:00,29133," Just have to open yer eyes.There,s lots of signage."
719750,Skipper D,2012-08-02 20:57:00,1970,"  ya , catch 22 ...... 4:30 am in the dark , their not lit up , go check ........."
719751,misfish,2012-08-02 21:00:00,29133," Oh forgot,yer not local.LOL  Been up since last years improvements to the parking."
719752,Skipper D,2012-08-02 21:02:00,1970,"its funny now but was'nt then  , both vehicles were parked right under one  ( signage ) so dark is not good when your parking ....... lol"
719753,smally21,2012-08-02 21:08:00,993,never in the history of time has anyone been issued a parking ticket they deserved. just ask them!
719755,davey buoy,2012-08-02 21:17:00,5505, I never deserved mine .Your right. lol.
719756,Skipper D,2012-08-02 21:17:00,1970,"  I could'nt answer that , never had one ... lol"
719758,Jer,2012-08-02 21:20:00,1426,"  Are we talking the same causeway, on Chemong Lake? I know the original thread was regarding the Tiffin launch in Barrie, but I was responding to Lew's comment about Chemong. There are no signs and the spots are definitely not ""vehicle/trailer sized"". Most boat trailers are backed up over the parking curb onto the grass so they can fit."
719760,misfish,2012-08-02 21:26:00,29133, Grass killers.
719599,vince.bornais,2012-08-02 12:01:00,50,"I haven't seen this posted before and thought I would let people know. I was at the Tiffin launch yesterday and noticed cars without trailers being tagged. I don't know what the fine is.It's about time they started to get ""some control"" over that launch. I,for one, welcome it."
719600,Terry,2012-08-02 12:04:00,14456,"good news but some people don't need a trailer for their boat but do need the launch, so they have to drive way over to the next parking lot, then run back to the launch"
719604,lew,2012-08-02 12:14:00,12766,"Is it actually against the rules to park there if you haven't launched a boat, are there signs to say that ??  The reason I ask is I often use the free ramp at the causeway on Chemong Lake but the last couple years the parking lot is sometimes completely full of vehicles without trailers by very early in the morning. I've gone there a few times to launch my boat but there's no parking spots left and I have to go somewhere else to launch.  I've never seen signs indicating any rules for whose allowed to park in the lot and have wonder if it's actually just a public lot for anyone. I have a feeling the cars without trailers  is a group of fellas using it for car pooling."
719605,BillM,2012-08-02 12:14:00,17367,"Those spots are for vehicles with trailers, if you don't have a trailer, enjoy the ticket!"
719613,Terry,2012-08-02 12:37:00,14456,well yeah that you can't miss all the signs they are everywhere but again unfair for some who uses the ramp to put a boat in but have no parking because they didn't have a trailer
719617,NAW,2012-08-02 13:04:00,4022,"If you won't need a trailer to launch, then that means you don't a launch ramp in most cases.  Just park where it's free, and throw your boat in anywhere along the shoreline..  No??  I definitally feel that the lot should be for vehicles with trailers only.  But I feel for the guys who come with the two seater pick up trucks and lauch their big boats, but the rest of the family/friends come in a van, or car with no trailer.  Now they have to park away from the launch, and walk there."
719619,BillM,2012-08-02 13:09:00,17367," To be honest, I don't see many cars hand bombing boats off their roofs (Actually I don't think I've ever seen one)  They can easily park in the lot just down the road and pull it across the grass and launch from the beach."
719633,Raf,2012-08-02 13:48:00,3495,it's a nice ramp.  i've only used it once late last fall so there was no issues with a crowd and i was able to use the CEO spot right on top of the ramp but i could see it being a zoo in the warm months.
719636,Jer,2012-08-02 13:59:00,1426,"  Hi Lew, I believe the parking at the causeway is for anybody, not specific to boat trailers. The only restriction is no overnight. There's lots of shore fisherman on the causeway every morning and they need to park as well.  And definitely car-pooling, I've done it myself...  If there's no parking in the lot, you can always park up Robinson Rd or Yankee Line on the wide shoulder, that's where the pros park for a tourney, sometimes as far up the road as the Foodland."
719638,lew,2012-08-02 14:04:00,12766,"I wan't really complaining Jer, more just being curious. If I can't get in there I just drive up to either Emerald Ilse or Gannons Narrows marinas.  Free IS nice once in awhile though"
719651,kickingfrog,2012-08-02 15:05:00,8333,People w/o trailers can park across the road and cross at the lights right there. Fifty to a hundred extra steps.
719694,Terry,2012-08-02 18:37:00,14456,"the last time I was there. there was one zodiac and one 12ft boat off the back of a pick up truck and I was asked where the parking was for them, had to tell them they were outta luck. the ramp I use in keswick, I would say 1 in 5 boats would not have trailers"
719701,davey buoy,2012-08-02 18:56:00,5505," Terry,you travel from innisfil to launch your boat in keswick?. Tell me it isn't so. LOL. Not all the time I would think?. And why?."
719705,hutch4113,2012-08-02 19:02:00,374," Actually there are signs on all the parking spots at the causeway, that they are for vehicles with Trailers only.  The spots (everywhere) are all vehicle/trailer size.  Only reason I know is I could not find a spot last time I launched.  And I was car pooling...except I am the one with the boat....hahahahahahaha. (Oh well...whatya gonna do).  No issue with people using the spots when the launch in not busy...I would too.  But when it is a zoo...which is pretty much every Friday to Sunday..those spots have to remain for vehicles with trailers...otherwise an already huge line up on launching/loading gets worse as people have to run across the street.  NOTE:  Also noticed they were ticketing vehicles with trailers, that were not parked in spots (i.e. on the grass, or crossways to those who are parked)."
719707,davey buoy,2012-08-02 19:09:00,5505," That's low,I don't care who you are."
719710,Terry,2012-08-02 19:15:00,14456, NO I don't live in Innisfil my house is in Bradford and I lived in Keswick for about 25 years
719711,davey buoy,2012-08-02 19:20:00,5505, Some reason I thought you did. That is along way to travel.My mistake.
719713,smally21,2012-08-02 19:25:00,993,"if its well signed, then parking spots for trailers are for trailers regardless of how busy it is, or any other reason. it is, after all, parking for the boat launch.  i suppose one could say it is unfair to trailerless boaters, but there are usually spots for this as well. and it is, after all, parking for the boat launch. when a guy drops a 50 foot truck and trailer rig in a regular parking lot no one seems that happy about it, so why not the other way around?  at the public launches in hamilton there is parking for both, and its patrolled regularly to tag cars in the trailer zones."
719714,davey buoy,2012-08-02 19:28:00,5505,"Free parking is only a stone throw away!Maybe a big stone but none the less, really close."
719724,Terry,2012-08-02 19:53:00,14456, yeah but as I said there isn't parking for trailerless boaters in the 2 parking lots at the ramp you have to drive to the next lot north and park there the guy that had the boat off the back of his truck asked me if I would keep an eye on his boat...took him 10 minutes not a big deal unless there are someone there looking for a free deal on fishing equipment
719726,smally21,2012-08-02 19:57:00,993,"if the trailer spots were full of cars, would not the trailer guy have to leave his boat unattended as well to find a spot? longer, perhaps, while he tries to find a spot for both truck and trailer?"
719728,misfish,2012-08-02 19:58:00,29133,"You can park a single car across the street.Short walk.   BTW ,I get great parking for my friends, that take me out.I don,t bother with that launch.  And how ornery are they here? When I kept my bayliner at the dock for an over night stay,the wife parked her car in one of those spots. Not a trailer was in the lot. Woke up to a ticket. I did,nt complain. Rules are rules."
719739,Terry,2012-08-02 20:20:00,14456,when we can get you to go fishing    nice avatar
719744,misfish,2012-08-02 20:28:00,29133,"  Im open all weekend. Tried calling you today.   nice avatar  And thanks.  I know where the smallies are hiding. Dont ask how,CUZ,i,ll have to throw ya over board .LOL"
719748,Skipper D,2012-08-02 20:48:00,1970,"You learn some thing new every day don't we , just like i did and i felt dam bad about when Back in June i think it was , i took Radar and Big Cliff out on Simcoe for a day of fishing , we got back at the end of the day and found tickets on both their vehicles , 30 bucks each for parking in the lot at the tiffin boat launch where they came to meet up with me that morning , up to that point i never knew they were handing out tickets to cars parking there with no trailers guess because i had always seen cars parking there , I offerd to pay the tickets for the boys but they would'nt hear of it , now the only thing i can hope for is i get a ticket for parking when i am at their place one day ......................"
