719333,motv8tr,2012-08-01 07:07:00,2587,"Hey all, I am taking two young fellas with me when I go to Lakair next week.  I bought them their fishing rods about 4 yrs ago and have decided to re-spool their reels.  Any suggestions as to what to use?  I was thinking either 6 or 8lb test, but should I go with mono or???  Here they mostly fish Sturgeon lake or on a rare occasion Simcoe, but after Lakair they will be camping for a few days and will be fishing from shore on the St. Lawrence I'm told, so I want something with a bit of strength and is durable.  Thanks Maureen"
719349,mike rousseau,2012-08-01 11:54:00,4661,"How young are the young fellas....  I used 8lb mono for everything till I was better at handling my tackle... Then I switched to braid... Mono is easy to handle... Easy to tie.... Easy to cut.... And cheap...  If ""I"" were to set up a rod to ""do it all"" it would probably be 30lb power pro....   ..."
719352,Billy Bob,2012-08-01 12:01:00,5865,The 6# or 8# mono would be my choice.
719362,Gregoire,2012-08-01 12:39:00,1397,I would go with braid. More durable and will last longer. The only problem is cutting it.

719373,jigsnreels,2012-08-01 13:57:00,133," Bring nail clippers with you, I keep a pair in my tackle box and they work fine for cutting braid.  I'm using 8 lb Power Pro and haven't had any problems."
719374,Raf,2012-08-01 14:05:00,3495,"i'd go with 8lb mono, easier to manage and won't cut their fingers off if they mishandle it like braid."
719375,grimsbylander,2012-08-01 14:09:00,3016,  X2  Casting ability...tangles...knots. With kids you have to use the K.I.S.S system!
719400,adempsey,2012-08-01 15:30:00,1498,"Personally, I wouldn't bother with spending $40 on superlines for young kids.  Go with decent 6lb or 8lb mono or copolymer.  I prefer Trilene XT, Maxima Ultragreen, Gamma Copolymer and P-Line Floroclear."
719416,Christopheraaron,2012-08-01 16:24:00,3525,"For younger kids braid may not be the best choice, mostly for knots, if they tie them they will most likely slip, I'd go with 8lb mono."
719417,BillM,2012-08-01 16:25:00,17367,6-8lb mono is cheap and will work just fine.
719434,Roy,2012-08-01 17:24:00,13728,"Yeah, kind of you to do this for them, Moe. As others have said, mono in 6-8 or even 10lbs would be the best option. We shouldn't be 'dumbing' them down because they're young...youngsters learn quickly. I've been fishing for 60 years and if I could only have one outfit, that's what I'd spool it with. Don't go the fringe brands either. As much as Berkley is not my favorite company, Trilene is a good choice in either XT or XL."
719509,motv8tr,2012-08-02 00:04:00,2587,"Thanks for all the suggestions guys, I'll go with the 10lb Trilene....Sat. is going to be a good day, the boys don't know I'm coming to take them to Bass Pro shops...they won't find out until I show up at their door and tell them to go get their reels....they are so excitable it's fun to watch their reactions  Maureen"
719511,BillM,2012-08-02 00:10:00,17367,10lb might coil up on them if they are using spinning reels..  Stick with 6lb
719646,snagged,2012-08-02 14:25:00,67,8lb suffix siege is a great line that's very durable
