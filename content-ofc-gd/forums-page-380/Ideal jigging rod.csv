718969,Hooked,2012-07-31 03:49:00,891,"Jigging is one technique I have not done enough of.  I am going to try it more often when I go on vacation to Rice Lake coming up.  What is your ideal rod and line you like to use for jigging in the weeds for walleye?  ie. length, power, action, braid\mono\copoly\flouro."
718976,uglyfish,2012-07-31 04:46:00,981,"6'3-6'8"" medium, xtra fast, 10-15lb braid, flouro leader optional"
718979,adempsey,2012-07-31 05:16:00,1498,"I picked up a G Loomis Walleye rod (WJR 751S) on clearance earlier this year and it performed beyond my expectations.    It's a one piece 6'3"" extra fast rod.   Several companies make similar rods and I was originally going to pick up a similar St.Croix Eyecon rod (ECS63MXF) but came across the other one at 50% off, so I had to buy it.  I use 20lb spectra braid with it.  edit: I just noticed you said IN THE WEEDS.  I put together a setup to ""rip the weeds"" with bucktails on Rice a couple of years ago.  It's basically a ""pike"" rod as well.   It's a 2 piece MH Rapala TS2 rod with an Abu Garcia Ambassadeur 5500 spooled with 65lb test PowerPro.  I think a shorter stiffer rod (5'6"" to 6'3"") is better for this technique but comes down to personal preference in the end."
718987,mercman,2012-07-31 11:04:00,7054,"I searched this same question here and on google, and came up with 6' MH fast action as the most popular selection for most anglers."
718993,scugpg,2012-07-31 11:22:00,1373,6'3 medium light xfast. for heavier jigs and weeds the medium might be a better option.  St croix legend tournament or avid series are a great choice. braided line.
719038,Hooked,2012-07-31 13:50:00,891, Probably a bit of both.
719216,Joeytier,2012-07-31 20:45:00,3990,"I like short Medium power, fast action rods (6'6"" or shorter).  I'd say the Fenwick Elitech rods are definitely the best blanks in their price range.  I always pair it with a shimano sahara/saros, and use 8 lb braid.  I love the ultra thin braid."
719224,buckster,2012-07-31 21:11:00,530,I second the st croix. Picked one up and paired it with a Stradic c14    Great for vertical jigging and rip jigging
719225,Billy Bob,2012-07-31 21:19:00,5865,"Jigging for walleyes and or crappies is my kind of fishing....been doing it for over 30 years....and I have to say I'm pretty good at it.  What kind of rod is the question......  But what kind of jigging should be the question...  I like using VERY light jigs for both walleyes and crappies.......so this is what determines the rod used.....  For walleyes I use 1/8 to SOMETIMES 1/4 oz jigs.....mostly all black bucktail jigs that I make myself.....  For crappies I use 1/64 SOMETIMES but mostly 1/32oz and SOMETIMES 1/16oz jigs.....many I tie myself.......  With that said I like a LIGHT 6.5' rod and MOSTLY 4# test line....SOMETIMES 6# test line for walleyes....but again mostly 4# test line......  Here is the rod I like to use....(use to make my own but now it's cheaper to just buy one).....  The model # GS662 (6'-6"") LIGHT rod for 2-8# TEST....  http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=738725&categoryId=0&parentCategoryId=0&subCategoryId=0&indexId=0&productVariantId=1292758&quantity=1&itemGUID=&WTz_l=Header%253BSearch-All+Products&destination=/user/wishlist.jsp  There is NOTHING like twitching a 1/8oz black jig to simulate a bug on the bottom and feel just a twing on the line...then setting the hook and knowing you just connected into another nice walleye dinner...  ...doing it this way is the best way to fight a fish....it's like it was tied onto to your line with no other weight whatsoever....  BTW.....this does catch a LOT of them damn smallmouth bass....  Bob"
719248,kickingfrog,2012-07-31 22:35:00,8333,"    I use to different rods to do that, and really wouldn't want to use either to do the other."
719291,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-01 01:25:00,2690," Yupper huge difference between rip jigging weeds, and, vertical jigging.  Definitely want two different set-ups to be most effective.  No less than a medium for ripping, medium-light for vertical.  Some good suggestions on here already for both."
719300,Fish Farmer,2012-08-01 01:45:00,2234,"A 6' Spiel master piece 1 piece rod, 8LB test mono. Jig weight depends on speed of drift, clarity and depth of the water. I've also went with a plain hook and bead 4 lb test, micro swivel and small piece of lead wire above the swivel.  Pencil lead if you can find thin, lead soldier works. Squeeze the tip of the lead wire and make a small hole with a awl were you pinched the wire. Should I say bait, Worm or leech, or Drop Shot Chomper worms best on the market if your going plastic to beat the Pan fish robing your bait."
719304,Moosebunk,2012-08-01 02:05:00,3970,"For probably 4-5 years now... Simply my 6'6"" Clarus Ultralight med-fast 2-piece with 8-10lb PowerPro & 6-8lb Drennan floro leads, spooled up on a 1000 series reel."
719808,chris.brock,2012-08-03 00:52:00,4053,"if you're cheap (like me), browse the rods at Can Tire, Wallymart, or wherever, look for a thin but stiff tip, ""noodley"" is no good,  I originally put powerpro on my jigging rod because I thought it might reduce pike bite-offs, I keep powerpro on my jigging rod because it's waaaay more sensitive than mono"
719846,Fang,2012-08-03 03:52:00,1330,"Ok since you put Rice lake in the post I will assume you'll be jigging weed lines and most likely be in that 8-14 ft of water that these edges occur in. For that depth I prefer a 6-3 or 6-6 rod. Mine right now are BPS Extreme and St Croix Mojo. Bucktails rule on rice followed by thin plastic minnows like Gulp and swim baits types. I also throw a lot of Power worms in 4"" on rice for walleye. Black and blue and pumpkin/chart work well. I probably wouldn't be jigging though without using braid as main line. A small brass 3/16 worm weight on the 4""worm turns more walleye for me"
