Hoping someone could give a beginner some pointers for fishing in late August in Algonquin. I understand trout fishing is what Algonquin is known for so catching a few of those beauties would be amazing.  I have fished with a Texas rig this summer with some success (caught bass) but I'm wondering if I should be trying something else for trout. This is a 5 day trip and we are taking a bunch of musical instruments with us so space for a tackle box will be very limited - I would prefer to have a basic, versatile setup. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you."
718829,Christopheraaron,2012-07-30 18:31:00,3525,"Welcome baracuda! panther martins, trout worms, mepps, and spoons should work. Good luck!"
718831,Rod Caster,2012-07-30 18:50:00,5784,"X2 what CK said. I'd bring small in-line spinners (mini worm harnesses) and a little extra weight to get below thermocline. Good luck, jam-on."
718887,Musky or Specks,2012-07-30 22:30:00,2710,wolf river rig is the only thing thats going to help you in August. Floating minnow bait behind it.I prefer Yo-Zuri minnows
718914,solopaddler,2012-07-30 23:58:00,8605," Bingo, beat me to it.  The fish will be deep so 2-4oz weights are standard.  A small lightweight portable depth finder would be worth its weight in gold."
718919,Broker,2012-07-31 00:10:00,482,"X2 on the fish finder, if not pick up a lake depth map at the algonquin offices."
718950,northernpike56,2012-07-31 02:12:00,717,"6'0 ML spinning rod and reel, 6 lb mono for your rod setup.  For lures, the above advice is good. Mepps work very well for me in algonquin. I usaully bring an assortment of mepps blk fury #0,1,2, panther martins in the same sizes, small 1-3"" floating rapala plugs, and a few spoons such as little cleo's and kastmasters. Also bring some hooks and sinkers, as well as worms.  If you are mostly fishing in a lake, then go with the above advice. Use the wolf river rig (3-way rig). It is esentially the mainline tied to snap swivel, 18-24"" dropper with 2-4 oz. weight, 5-6 ft fluoro leader with your lure tied on the back. Let it sink a bit then start trolling, the trout will most likely be holding along the thermocline."

719458,Christopheraaron,2012-08-01 19:25:00,3525,Oh also if you happen to see any trout really shallow a few small husky jerks can be a good friend.
