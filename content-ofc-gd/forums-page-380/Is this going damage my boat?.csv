When I opened my bilge I found this (check out what I found floating in my bilge)  It appears there was a constant power running from my panel that doesn't shut off with the master power. The positive lead was sitting in the bilge water ARGH!  I've rinsed the bilge with a hose the the best I can. Hopeing this doesn't damage my hull. The paint doesn't seem to be affected yet. You think they would put water proof ends on power wires. 
719640,BillM,2012-08-02 14:06:00,17367,It's not going to hurt a thing.  Did you fix the wiring issue?
719662,RangerGuy,2012-08-02 16:03:00,564,Yeh I cut the ends and wrapped them tight.... I was shocked to see this live connection was just left open to short against something..  I was freak'n because I thought maybe some of the bolts etc I used to install the charger etc were not stainless steel and were causing a reaction with the aluminum hull.. so I pulled the middle floor hatch out just to make sure THEN I found the positive wire sitting in water HAHA!
