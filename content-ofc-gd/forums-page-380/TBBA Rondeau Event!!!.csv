719663,reelinrolly,2012-08-02 16:06:00,281,I was just wondering if any members from the board will be fishing the TBBA event this Sunday. We are heading down tomorrow morning. We are super jacked to fish lol
719691,Lunker777,2012-08-02 18:09:00,866,I know a few teams fishing the tourney..... best of lucky to you guys. It can be a tough place this time of year.

719837,Christopheraaron,2012-08-03 02:11:00,3525,"The event's at long point? If so, my dad and I will be there this sunday, probably in a rental."
719868,reelinrolly,2012-08-03 10:21:00,281,The event is on rondeau bay Sunday
719978,Djeep,2012-08-03 16:43:00,199,"X2 for slime on lsc!  I speculated about the tourney, but as lunker mentioned, this time of the year rondeau can be a treacherous jungle."
