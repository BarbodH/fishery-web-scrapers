719922,jigsnreels,2012-08-03 14:13:00,133," Sure am.  This is something that a lot of editors struggle with - do you present the story as honestly and unadorned as possible, or do you dress it up, water it down, sugar-coat it, etc. to make it more palatable to the readership?  It's clear that a lot of people don't like that phrase, myself included, and I took great offense to the suggestion that perhaps I do. I probably should have took that comment to mean that I support the use of the phrase in print.  I don't believe that a responsible journalist or media editor would allow that phrase to be published unless it was a significant part of the story.  Do I believe that printing it somehow ""popularizes"" the term?  Absolutely not.  If it casts a spotlight on the kind of ignorant, hateful lowlifes that commit such actions, than I believe it does far more good than harm.  Failing to acknowledge that these attitudes are out in the world does a lot more to encourage this kind of behavior than the mere reporting of the use of an offensive term by people who are commiting far more offensive acts.  Anyway, my bucket is red.  But nobody's tipped me in the water yet."
719930,Terry,2012-08-03 14:38:00,14456,"sorry but that is a joke read a story in the sun then the same story in the star  they make up the news to suit their point of view, well at lest twist it to suit them"

719938,Terry,2012-08-03 14:54:00,14456,"so, did you know the main victim was white...yes or no . was that an oversight on most of the media outlets or was it an important piece of info left out because it made the story less marketable"
719941,GreenCanada,2012-08-03 14:57:00,375," I don't think the media was trying to make everyone from the area in question guilt of racism, but there was an investigation conducted by the Ontario Human Rights Commission. I haven't had a chance to find the physical report yet, but here is a snippet I found interesting.  ""The commission received more than 30 responses after setting up a hotline to gather information about attacks on anglers in southern and central Ontario.  Most of the submissions came from the Lake Simcoe, Peterborough and Rideau Locks areas.  According to the commission, Asian anglers were subjected to racial slurs and stone throwing. In some cases, their fishing equipment was destroyed and they were physically attacked.""   The Sun is easily the most ridiculous media corporation in North America. Have you ever watched Sun News TV? It's a joke, it's like Fox News. I often rely on newspaper articles for basic information and then do research myself to form my own opinion.  It's a good thing you blew up the size of your ""proof"" statement, I may have missed it. I forgot to quote my earlier statement about how are we are sure that 1 of the 2 pushed into the water were white. The video you linked to was about the victim who suffered brain damage. He could have simple been in the car with his friends and may have not been the one pushed into the water. It is my understanding that there were 2 fishermen of Asian heritage fishing with a couple buddies, and 2 of the group were pushed in. There is no mention, to my knowledge who, besides the driver was pushed into the water. But thank you for enlarging the size of your response, it made sure I didn't miss it!"

As a friend of the Berwick's , someone who watched Shayne grow from a baby to a man and now sadly back to baby . No Terry I do not get my info from the papers ,T.V. etc. I got it from Shayne , Charlie and Ruohang , when Shayne came to his friends aid that night the first punches were aimed at him as ""What's a good white boy doing out with these ,I will use the word asians , not the word that was used that night . Allso forgotten is Middleton is a pro motocycle racer , one who knows how to handle motor vehicals at high speeds Ruohang was just a scared kid who was trying to ecape a further beating , and poor Shayne was just a great guy out for a nights fishing with his asian buddys .. NOW  !!!!  . To just put this off as some Drunk kids is to just send a message to all the drunk kids , do what you want a few months in jail is nothing , BUT WHAT ABOUT Shayne's jail . OR his parents , his father is/was a pillar of the community , donateing his time teaching , coaching hockey at our local rink etc. etc. now he spends his time careing for Shayne . Im out of here , sorry but this is way to close to home and to think that no one will pay for this night but the GOOD GUYS ... SAD SAD  Im sorry to the op but I am asking the mods before this gets out of hand and further soils the Berwicks pain by just forgetting someone  a real PERSON was serious hurt that night and will never be the same , a young life ruined , and making this into a ""it wasnt racist"" , it was raciest."
719968,Terry,2012-08-03 16:09:00,14456,and it is sad   but all of that does not change the fact that the media hid as much as possible the fact that the main victim was white...made for a better story  and that I was one of maybe 2 or 3 people reading this thread that knew he was white  it was a terrible crime....
719973,Headhunter,2012-08-03 16:16:00,5703,So sorry for your pain Bruce... as well as the pain being endured by the many victums of this crime... HH

Enough ."
719976,Terry,2012-08-03 16:23:00,14456,"so we have different opinions then, you're saying"
719979,ehg,2012-08-03 16:52:00,2666,"Having fished all my life, have seen a type of racism or whatever you want to call it directed at people of Asian descent. When going by a causeway;  folks would be filling buckets with panfish or whatever they caught. Sometimes they weren't following rules for whatever reason. There would be racist assumptions that is the reality.  The solution is... i dunno?  Maybe better education for all around.   Proper observation of rules for some. Proper channeling of resentment for some others."
719982,jigsnreels,2012-08-03 17:12:00,133," And that, to me, is the point.  It's an absolute tragedy that someone was seriously injured and his life forever altered as a result of this ridiculous nonsense (condolences to your friends, Bruce).  And yes, the victim in this case was white.  But was he the intended target of the attack?  Judging by the OP and by Bruce's recount of the event, it seems not.  The fact that it was a Caucasian who was injured in the attack doesn't mitigate or nullify in any way the motivation for the attack in the first place.  If it had just been three white guys fishing, who knows if there would have even been an incident to report?"
719996,Terry,2012-08-03 17:53:00,14456,"well it doesn't take away the fact that it was a crime where the punishment was way to soft  but the opinions of family and friends hold very little weight in court..it's known to be bias, emotional and unreliable and that's way the crouwn never puts them on the stand until the sentencing portion of the trial.  who knows maybe it was racially motivated,I know that when I first heard of this crime was outraged and wanted stiffer sentences for hate crimes.   read and watched the news about this story, close to my home stomping grounds. then I heard the kid who said nipper tipping was just someone a reporter was interviewing for local flavour in the next town, he didn't know any of the people involved , he didn't know anyone that had ever done it here were no reports in the area of it happening....the story lost some credibility  then someone told me the guy with brain damage was white, I laughed, as if  but after a lot of research I one one report that showed he was in fact white...people here thought I was full of it..but it made me wonder about the story  then I am told there were 7 people pushed into the water only 2 of them asian ..the story was breaking down  a cop at a party was saying they were feeling pressure to go the hate crime route ..... a couple of special interest groups gain creditability and a seat on the police board  so it was the straw that broke the camels back..........why were people lying and omitting things in this case either to hype the story or to make a case that really wasn't there...    what the truth is, I don't know, but lying does not help their case.. I will say no more"
719997,jedimaster,2012-08-03 17:56:00,3472,"The motivation for the attack was blatantly racist. This was even echoed in the Appeal to have the sentance lowered. The appeal was turned down in part because of the fact that it was a racially motivated crime. I have personally seen, heard and have had happen to racism while fishing on the lake and on shore. I have even seen in person people that post on this very forum act out in a racist manour towards asians. To try and push this off as some good old boys just getting a bit stupid when they got drunk is skirting the facts. The fact that the young man that got seriously injured was white is irrelevant. The motive, and the reason for the attack to have started from the begining was due to the racist punks that did what they did. As far as terminolgoy being racist or not, people use terms that they don't realize are racist all the time. Like itis. I have heard lots of people say ""oh man that was some serious turkey, I got the itis for sure"" However it is in fact a racial slur against black people. The term white bucket brigade is clearly a racist insult and jab against asian that fish from shore. So make joke all you want about blck buckets or yellow buckets or whatever rainbow you wish, you can do so now knowing that the majority of decent humans on the earth know that you are just painting yourself as an ignorant racist. Why not use the correct terminolgy and call them shore fisherman? Is that so hard? Does it hurt you? Sometimes being a little bit pollitically correct is the right thing to do."

I'm finished discussing this issue as Terry continually shows a lack of compassion or understanding of the issues. He seems to want to believe this was not a racially motivated attack regardless of the facts and it seems he is trying to make excuses for what happened. I for one am surprised at his lack of respect for others in this thread and the underlying racial tone of some of his posts here.  I'm going to ask for this thread to be locked."
719806,GreenCanada,2012-08-03 00:47:00,375,"Sad to see such a heinous crime go relatively unpunished. Two years is nothing compared to what the fellow with brain damage has to deal with now. How can anyone justify such racist attacks or comments. Subtle comments such as white-bucket brigade and the like only help perpetuate the stereotyping within our beloved hobby. Hopefully this can be turned into a positive by increasing awareness and by providing more education to all people.   http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1235868--no-change-to-sentence-in-asian-angler-attack-court-rules  ""The Appeal Court of Ontario has upheld a man’s jail sentence for criminal negligence and assault after a racially motivated attack on anglers that left one of them with permanent brain damage.  The Crown had appealed Trevor Middleton’s sentence of two years less a day, saying it didn’t reflect the racial overtones of the crime.  But in the decision by Justices Kathryn Feldman, David Doherty and Harry LaForme released Thursday morning, the court denied the Crown’s appeal of that sentence, as well as Middleton’s appeal of his conviction.  The Crown had argued that Justice Alfred Stong failed “to give adequate weight to the numerous aggravating factors in this case, including the racially motivated nature of the offence and the severe consequences of the crime.”  In December 2009, an Ontario Superior Court jury found Middleton, 23, guilty of two counts of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and four counts of aggravated assault.  Middleton’s trial heard that he repeatedly rammed his Ford F-150 pickup truck into a Honda Civic driven by angler Ruohang Liu, 24, early on Sept. 16, 2007.  The court heard that the attack followed a “nip-tipping” incident in which Liu and Charles Hogan, 24, were pushed into the water at a popular Sutton-area fishing spot at Mossington Park.  As they attempted to flee the attack, Liu’s car hit a tree after being rammed by Middleton’s truck. As a result, one of Liu’s passengers, 28-year-old Shayne Berwick, suffered permanent brain damage that left him unable to care for himself.  Berwick’s father, Colin, said in an interview that he was disappointed by the decision but not surprised. He noted that, during appeal arguments, Justice Doherty said that Middleton wasn’t a “hard-core racist” but “a young guy who acted like a yahoo.”  “There’s nothing we can do,” Colin Berwick said. “We’ll just concentrate on Shayne now.”  The Crown had originally asked for a prison sentence of eight to 10 years.  In arguments presented to the appeal court, Crown lawyer Alex Alvaro said Middleton’s sentence of two years less a day did not reflect the racially motivated nature of the attack.  The Crown also argued that Stong didn’t give “adequate weight” to the deliberateness and duration of Middleton’s conduct, and said the judge erred by placing too much emphasis on the youth of the accused and his lack of a criminal record.  Alvaro had argued that a five-year sentence would be more appropriate.  In seeking to have his conviction overturned, Middleton’s lawyers argued that it wasn’t fair to say the attack was racially motivated.  In Thursday’s decision, the judges wrote that cross-examination “severely undermined” the argument that Middleton acted as a leader of the group attacking the Asian fishermen or that he was one of the people who pushed the fishermen in.  Middleton is a professional motorcycle racer from Georgina Township.  Berwick’s stepmother, Terry, has said she had hoped the case would be classified as a hate crime.  The court’s decision brought a mixed reaction from Lawyer Avvy Yao-Yao Go, clinic director of the Metro Toronto Chinese & Southeast Asian Legal Clinic.  “I was relieved that at least they affirmed the guilty verdict,” Go said in an interview.  “I think there are a lot of people in our community who are somewhat disappointed.”  Go praised the work of York Region police in quelling attacks on Asian fishermen through community education and undercover police work, which included sending officers to fishing spots, disguised as anglers.  “What they did should serve as a model for other law enforcement agencies,” Go said.  Middleton served less than two months before he was freed on bail. He went into custody on Wednesday, on the eve of the appeal court’s decision, said his lawyer, Lance Beechener."""
719810,Fisherman,2012-08-03 01:12:00,7201,It's long overdue that some of these so called judges should suffer the same fate as the victims. Maybe then they would have a bit more compassion for the victims and send the crimies up to Churchill as polar bear food.
719811,Terry,2012-08-03 01:15:00,14456,lets see one of the 2 guys he pushed in the water was white the guy that got the brain damage was white where is this Racially motivated attack on angler you talk about.. there were more white people attacked then other races pure propaganda now I am disgusted by this attack and believe he should have got more time  and no person has the right to attack no person...

719824,mercman,2012-08-03 01:31:00,7054,"That is truly disturbing.Thank god i never heard of it before, and pity anyone i see doing it"
719825,Terry,2012-08-03 01:31:00,14456,"a reporter was interviewing people the day of the crime and a kid about 18 years old used the term nipper-tipping, pushing fishing Asians into the water however he was not part of the situation and he was not at the dock or where the car crashed, he was just a puck kid shooting his mouth off and the media picked up on it because it makes good news....."
719832,alphaalpha,2012-08-03 01:44:00,475,"Disgusting situation and he should have gotten more time regardless of it being a ""hate crime"".  Assault of that nature should be punished to the full extent.  To ram another vehicle with your own is in a whole different league than just pushing someone in the water (not that I condone that either).  For what it's worth I would think using a vehicle like that should be considered assault with a deadly weapon or possibly even attempted murder...  my 2 cents,  AA."
719859,GreenCanada,2012-08-03 05:25:00,375," Just out of curiosity, how do you know that one of the 2 guys pushed into the water were white? I know a couple of their names sound caucasian, but I know a few Asian-Canadian friends with ""John Smith"" type names. I obviously wasn't there, but I for one rely on what I read and critically analyze in situations such as these. Based on the evidence presented in court it was determined that the actions of the convicted demonstrated a racially motivated attack, but not to the level that would cause hate crime legislation to be applied.  I fully agree that no person has the right to attack another person, but I'm not sure how you can determine this situation to be pure propaganda."
719860,GreenCanada,2012-08-03 05:27:00,375," It is not a term of endearment and not likely one that you would use to their face (unless you're insulting them), it is a way to disparage against a group of individuals. That isn't in my own thought process, it is merely an observation."
719861,GreenCanada,2012-08-03 05:29:00,375, I couldn't agree more AA.
719865,Terry,2012-08-03 09:40:00,14456," at first I heard all the news reports and thought hate crime. I was talking about it when I a guy said, well you know the guy in the hospital is white I didn't believe him till I saw a news report that showed family members and they were white then a cop said that there were more white people pushed in that day, but that doesn't make good news and cops get more funding every time there is a hate crime so they went along with the story... whether hate crime or just an attack this guy should have got more time"
719877,jigsnreels,2012-08-03 12:34:00,133," By the same token, you can also thank the media for putting a spotlight on this kind of disgusting behavior.  Would be better to keep it on the Q.T.?"
719882,salmon,2012-08-03 12:39:00,334," Sinclair Please clarify ""they"" as in asians????? or ???"
719884,Gregoire,2012-08-03 12:43:00,1397," I would argue this point as the term ""white bucket brigade"" implies a negative, and is commonly associated with people of Asian Heritage. It is a term used to imply something negative based on someone's race and actions.  When discussing racism you should not view things as you see them. Rather you should try empathize with a person. In this case you might want to consider whether you would want the term ""white bucket brigade"" used against you.  Racism is a form of harassment. As such an outside person and especially someone who is performing the harassment cannot determine whether it is on fact harassment. That determination relies completely on the victim of the harassment. Again in this case I think if you were to ask someone of Asian decent whether they liked being called part of the ""white bucket brigade"" I am pretty sure they would say no. My patents taught me that it is not ok to say things just because they are true, you should consider how the other person would react to your words. When was the last time you walked up to an overweight woman on the street and called her fat?  For these reasons I do consider the term ""white bucket brigade"" to be racist. I'm not saying it isn't factual. I'm just saying that it is not a term that we should shrug off because it is based on anecdotal evidence."
719889,Terry,2012-08-03 12:48:00,14456," so you like the term nipper tipping cause that was the only thing he was referring to again some young punk that had nothing to do with the crime coined the phrase and the media ran with it..I think what is disgusting is the media repeating this disgusting phrase and making it part or our lives.....  reporting the crime is a good thing, trying to make it look like everyone from  Georgina is running around burning crosses and attacking radical groups is silly"
719894,Terry,2012-08-03 13:01:00,14456," agreed I always thought the white bucket brigade were all the people that had buckets to put all their fish in, sitting along every canal and water access in Keswick [i grew up there], it was never about race"
719895,kenzy31,2012-08-03 13:04:00,261," hahaha! I coudn't stop laughing at this! I have a maroon bucket, a blue bucket, and.....gassssppppp.....a black bucket! Where the hell do i fit in???"
719897,jigsnreels,2012-08-03 13:07:00,133," Don't like it at all.  It's odd that it's not just called ""angler-tipping,"" isn't it?  It's not hard to determine which group the term is directed toward, and I'm reasonably certain that the term was not the media's invention.  Ignoring the fact that something like this is occuring just gives the perpetrators a free pass to carry on, IMO.  I suppose ""gay-bashing"" is an irresponsible term as well, because lots of people get beat up outside of nightclubs."
719900,Terry,2012-08-03 13:16:00,14456, please explain how you are reasonably certain that the term was not the media's invention.  inquiring minds want to know
719903,Terry,2012-08-03 13:31:00,14456,proof the guy was white I hope this link works http://www.ottawasun...eos/51821968001  you were saying.....

719907,jigsnreels,2012-08-03 13:45:00,133," Media regulatory bodies, like the Ontario Press Council for one, wouldn't stand for a newspaper inventing a term like ""nip-tipping,"" as it would be considered a made-up term that goes beyond reasonable discourse to be directed at an indentifiable group for the purpose of insult and sarcasm.  A paper wouldn't be banned from using such a phrase in print, however, if it was part of the reporting on a specific story.  The fact that the phrase was put in quotes indicates that, well, it was likely quoted from an outside source.  But yeah, blame the media for the incident.  Better that we just ignore stuff like this, eh?"
719916,soobnoob,2012-08-03 14:00:00,55,"This was a SERIES of incidents that specifically targeted asian anglers and was all over the asian news until finally this truck ramming incident occurred before it made headlines all over the place. you think cops would set up an undercover sting over one incident??!  as far as the media goes, as long as it wasn't a writer/editor who said it, they'll print anything. Look what happend to the espn writer with the Jeremy Lin article."
719917,Terry,2012-08-03 14:02:00,14456," so you have no proof you are just assuming  and again no one denied the incident, but like the media you picked up one one thing out of content and ran with it"
719918,craigdritchie,2012-08-03 14:08:00,1586,"The ancestry of the people involved is irrelevant.  You have some idiot intentionally and repeatedly ramming his truck into another person's car. His actions left someone with permanent brain damage.  The idiot belongs in jail, plain and simple."
