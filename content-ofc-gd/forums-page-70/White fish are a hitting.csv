LOL Access spot was almost washed out, but we managed to just get on. We knew it would get worse, so we got set up and got busy. Got busy quick. Numerous hits,hook ups,losts, and landed. By the time we left, we were able to just get off. Looks like the long forecast is going to really put a hurt on our access point. I hope we get some cold weather soon, but it,s not looking promising. Any fish that came in, came in to eat. I ran out of curse words every time I set and missed. A good morning with a good ole friend and his , I would say future SNL, but who knows.  	 LOL Oh those sunrises are coming early again. 8)  Da trio  Sunday is calling for high temps and rain. NOOOOOOOO"
