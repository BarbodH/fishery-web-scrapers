Thursday night my truck in brampton was stolen from my driveway between 7:30pm and 9pm. Its a 2013 Dodge Ram 1500. V6, 4x4 quad cab. Has a Matching grey Cap (like a leer with tinted windows). Truck has a black verticle stripe on the tail gate. The rear chrome bumper has 4 holes for backup sensors but no sensors installed. Also the front bumper has 4 holes for fog lights and tow hooks but neither are installed. I believe the truck is still in the brampton area as the thieves used a Home Depot Card that was in the truck at Home depot in brampton. Police have been notified but have done nothing, Not even gone to the store to get the footage of the people who used it 4 times(Thankfully home depot called and said some unusual activity was made). They said they have footage but will only release it to the cops, Great.... well if they would go to the store, Anyway, also in the car was a handheld Garmin GPS, Cordless drill, some costa sunglasses (GRRRRR) and a number of other things. If you know anyone that works at Peel region and could maybe ask them to do some work that would be awesome because I know with all crimes time is of the essence and the fact they there have footage of the people is amazing. If they take the cap off there is an FLW, Costa and Zippo Outdoors field staff sticker on the rear cab glass, on the cap there is a Summit Sticker on the right hand lower side of the tailgate glass.  In the pictures are the old bumper that I smushed ice fishing a few weeks ago. The current rear and front bumpers are both chrome.    "

They didn't just get the truck; but my Ski Doo, ramps, all my ice fishing gear and a lot more. Cops found it 10 days latter out on the Res; stripped to the bones. Again sorry to hear and know your pain and the feeling of what the hell why me. Dan."
1023563,Carp,2018-02-26 03:03:00,1488,"Sorry to hear about your truck. Hopefully, you get it back in good condition."
1023576,Sinker,2018-02-26 14:07:00,8692,That sucks. Hopefully they never find it again and your insurance doesn't screw you over too bad.  S.
1023582,LeXXington,2018-02-26 14:31:00,1928,That sucks
1023584,jedimaster,2018-02-26 14:56:00,3472,I would like it back. Im gonna get screwed on it because its financed so I will go from free and clear in two years to starting all over again. Grr
1023630,buick14,2018-02-26 22:13:00,741,That sucks. shes gonzo BUDD.....
1023635,jedimaster,2018-02-26 22:35:00,3472,So far insurance has been fine. Got a rental right away. They are merging the deductable for house and car insurance so i only pay the higher of the two and will apply tge dedictable on either of the two for whatever works better for me. So no complaints so far. Now just need to deal with adjuster on values. Will update how tgat goes if you guys want to know. Insurance is through thinkinsure (broker) and wawanesa.
1023649,GBW,2018-02-27 00:28:00,8460,I really hope all works out in the end for ya Vince.  I remember seeing the box mod you did for fishing and hunting and I know you like that Ram
1023724,Mister G,2018-02-28 11:28:00,1429,"Is the key on this vehicle ""Chipped"" or not..........Just wondering how they can steal a vehicle if the key has a chip in it."
1023726,jedimaster,2018-02-28 12:30:00,3472,Chipped. Thats what I asked the cop and the insurance. They said they can do it.
1023733,bigugli,2018-02-28 15:04:00,6138,"Every time they come up with a new antitheft device, the pros eventually find a way around them."
1023748,Mister G,2018-02-28 18:58:00,1429,Yet we MUST pay around $200 for a chipped key that does nothing.
1023766,GBW,2018-02-28 22:51:00,8460,"Vince, try and remind me to look into that at work tomorrow. I know that I can get a chipped key in for a customer (whom we know and or has ownership on them) and even after cutting it, it won't start the car till synced.  So I want to try and figure that out. G"
1023820,spyder3g,2018-03-01 20:28:00,50,"For a last couple of months have you given your key and clicker to someone? If yes. Do you really trust him? That's the easiest way to make a duplicate of your key, chip and clicker and use them or to sell them to requester.  I mean some mechanics including Canadian Tire, Act Green & Ross etc,"
1023822,BillM,2018-03-01 20:44:00,17367,"It sucks, but this is why we pay insurance."
1023823,jedimaster,2018-03-01 21:18:00,3472,Key was not given to anyone. No one drives my truck. Insurance said they should be able to start the settlement march 9th. so hopefully this can all get wrapped up in a positive light. Driving this sentra as a rental sucks.
1023827,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-01 23:50:00,10439,With some of these new cars you don't even need the key to steal it. https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.powernationtv.com%2Fpost%2Fthieves-can-now-steal-a-car-without-keys-in-under-60-seconds&h=ATMpmyFmlzvt5hkCTh6CLRsxVWLUOWZCz3z-srtuT0l5O248cX0m5D1gWZa9j3P1dNYRhZS8Uet2ntlZ2U4LYSt4aERfjmjpF-A7r7z7vqaTWdHTItTBlQ
1023828,Mister G,2018-03-01 23:53:00,1429,Must be a Dodge thing  ? ? ?
1023830,GBW,2018-03-02 00:30:00,8460,"Should ask for a Kia Stinger, LOL!!!"
