This one with my older son....   And this is the one with the younger son and 3 good fishing buddies   As you can tell white fish are cooperating and have no idea season is about to end....don't let them know ha ha...  The usual menu of Meegs seems to work so why bother change it....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman "
