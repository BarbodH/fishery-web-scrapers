Love to see him getting into it all on his own....much more enjoyable than my own fish ;-) Anyhow....another Meggs show today....right on bottom even though some fish came higher up..... Ice is deteroating quickly from underneat and with shore ice also melting I will likely skip next weekend. Therefore this will be my last white fish report for the ice season....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
