I bought a new sled this winter and I haven't been able to get 500 miles on it.  On the other had, I can't wait for shallow king/trout action on Lake O's south shore. First world problems but maybe one last blast from old man winter in March (not like this hasn't happened b4) and then on to double digit temps.. Oh yea, and throw in a winning lottery ticket into the mix just for fun..LOL. A boy can dream.."
