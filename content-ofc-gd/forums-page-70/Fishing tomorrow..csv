1023242,misfish,2018-02-20 23:10:00,29133,Good luck on getting on here at Simcoe bud. Majority of the access points are open water after all the rain we got.
1023250,ketchenany,2018-02-21 01:23:00,3229,And more to come. may need the toon to get out! 
1023262,Chuck Enwinde,2018-02-21 07:37:00,247,Think I'm going to give it a day to hopefully tighten back up.  Might be a bit sloppy out there right now.  Thursday looks like a beauty day if you're up for another go.
1023298,misfish,2018-02-21 21:57:00,29133,"Well I just drove around the bay locally here. It,s a skaters dream out there. -1 with a -10 wind chill all day.  Things look tight around here. Bit of water at the creek mouths.  It,s not that far of a walk Paul where we were. Travel light. If that is possible. LOL"
1023340,Tybo,2018-02-22 17:07:00,1373,Sorry for not getting back to people. Just got the virus out of my computer and phone.
1023341,Fisherman,2018-02-22 17:29:00,7201,"Tybo, I was just up at IBP this morning to check the access, all is well.  First couple of feet there's a bit of water sandwiched between ice, after that it's solid."
1023342,Tybo,2018-02-22 17:34:00,1373,Is it possible to get a sled out over the shore line?
1023343,Fisherman,2018-02-22 17:55:00,7201,"The ramp and parking lot and grassed areas are all pretty much bare, so I guess you could unload right at the ramp.  There's no pressure cracks or heaved up areas by the ramp.  Way further north you can see the pressure crack, probably around the 10th line"
1023353,Tybo,2018-02-22 20:11:00,1373,Thanks Fisherman.
