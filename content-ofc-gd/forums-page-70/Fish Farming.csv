1023931,OhioFisherman,2018-03-04 07:48:00,6623,"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/washington-legislature-phases-atlantic-salmon-farming-53480976 If they are trying to restore populations of native Pacific Salmon, throwing 250,000+ Atlantic Salmon into the mix probably won't help? California considers pike an invasive species and poisons them."
1023941,Jmeyer,2018-03-04 15:51:00,83,"It never occurred to me that Atlantic's were being farmed onÂ  the west coast, common sense would suggest that this practise could have severe impacts on all ready sensitive eco systems. Fish farming in general is already proven to be environmentally unfriendly without adding invasive species to the equation."
