1023458,Carp,2018-02-23 22:10:00,1488,Lucky that truck didn't slide into the river.  Thanks for sharing.
1023470,Woodsman,2018-02-24 02:09:00,1286,Why? The bridge is on the other side of N.E.M. No need to cross it if coming down Hwy 73.
1023473,HTHM,2018-02-24 05:46:00,4082,"The rebuilding effort will jam things up a bit I think, Woodsman."
1023474,Woodsman,2018-02-24 10:53:00,1286,Mostlikely true.
1023476,ketchenany,2018-02-24 12:59:00,3229,Here is the Humber at Rutherford and 27 at 7 thisÂ morning! bridge is solid but ice almost reaches the railing!  
1023478,dave524,2018-02-24 14:09:00,4508,"I seem to recall years ago they used to dynamite these blockages to lessen flooding and damage to structures, is that not an option these days ?"
1023481,OhioFisherman,2018-02-24 16:14:00,6623,"They used to do that on this side of the lake too, we have a couple-few rivers that are more or less infamous for their ice related flooding. I - 90 crosses the Vermilion river here just south of the small city of Vermilion, the ice regularly jams up below the bridge and there are marinas, restaurants, homes, and other businesses before you get to Lake Erie. Right at the mouth of the river is a big steel breakwall, one year the ice jam let go all at once and washed like 50-60 boats that were stored on cradles at a marina there out to the lake and into the breakwall. One of my friends lost his 30 foot Searay when that happened, the surprising thing to me was how many people though that only carried boat insurance "" in season ""."
