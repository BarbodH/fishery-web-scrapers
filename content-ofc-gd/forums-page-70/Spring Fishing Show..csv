1022713,Handlebarz,2018-02-12 14:46:00,3790,Yes the last few years there have been 4 musky booths and many retailers have musky stuff JB's has a big selection

1022833,PUMP KNOWS,2018-02-14 01:35:00,937,
1022957,BlueEye,2018-02-15 14:09:00,338,"I'm all signed up - thanks for the discount code guys.  Looking forward to ""Musky Sunday"""
1023065,Kawartha Kev,2018-02-16 23:43:00,281,Pretty disappointing day at the show today not a lot to see or do just a couple big tackle dealers mostly JB's and Naturals not very busy was in and out in a little over an hour no deals to be had for what I was looking for. Kawartha Kev
1023073,buick14,2018-02-17 01:41:00,741,"I have to agree with you.  Total waste of time and money. although I’m not a Muskie Guy, handlebarz baits booth had some good looking stuff, and also the perfect jig had some cool stuff. Everything considered I would pass on going next year."
1023080,captpierre,2018-02-17 13:53:00,2521,Thanks for the feedback guys. Will wait for the bigger Sportsman show I think.  Hopefully will be better.
1023081,wkrp,2018-02-17 13:55:00,656,"I beg to differ . I listened to the seminars by Big Jim , JP Derose and Paul Powis  and  that made it well worthwhile for me."
1023083,HTHM,2018-02-17 15:25:00,4082,"Cover me as well, please."
1023084,Toronto_Angler,2018-02-17 15:52:00,698,Yeah wasn't that great there wasn't much there at all especially in the way of deals.  Also very empty felt like I was being stared at everytime I entered a booth. Wouldn't mind if it wasn't 15 bucks to get in
1023086,kfn,2018-02-17 17:37:00,14,This is why I stopped going 3 years ago.
1023101,msp,2018-02-18 00:43:00,1336,Meh. Definitely not worth $15 . Went on Friday and was disappointed . Should be free or a non perishable donation
1023103,buick14,2018-02-18 02:29:00,741,^yes agreed
1023112,Henricus,2018-02-18 04:06:00,118,"I totally disagree with the negative feedback ""...wasn't busy at all"" - would you have rather been pushing and shoving your way around?  If so, next time try Saturday instead of Friday. ""...stared at every time I went to a booth"" - I hope I don't end up reading a later post of you complaining when you can't find help at any retail store. I talked to both the Shimano and St Croix guys about repairing a couple rods.  Listened to Dave Mercer, always entertaining.  Picked up some new Live Target lures accompanied by a ""free"" t-shirt.  Also picked up my first Handlebarz lure.  Chatted to the Muskies Canada guys about a French River/West Arm excursion.  All in all a great escape from the cold weather and well worth the time and money spent. Remember, the more people you talk out of going the more likely you will no longer have the option to complain about it."
1023155,fishdawg,2018-02-19 03:29:00,912,And then how would the organziers be able to afford to put on the show???? 
1023163,BlueEye,2018-02-19 13:55:00,338,"I had a chance to attend ""Musky Sunday"" yesterday and had a great time.  I thought the presenters (Jim Saric, Gord Pyzer, John Anderson and Jeremy Smith) did a great job and I really enjoyed getting a chance to speak with some of them afterwards.  I really liked how the presenters went into deeper musky strategies and environmental factors rather than just another presentation about why you need to do a figure-8 at the boat.  It was also nice getting a chance to meet Mike and some other OFC members while I was up there.  Bought a couple new Handlebarz for the 2018 season - already looking forward to spring!"
1023170,Musky Plug,2018-02-19 17:30:00,398,"I went yesterday as well. Was hoping to goto the musky seminars as well but didn't have enough time. Looks like I missed on a good one. Did walk around for just over an hour. There weren't any deals to be found, from what I could see. Mostly just store prices. Did buy some stuff but mostly things I couldn't buy at local tackle stores.  "
1023234,KawarthaAngler,2018-02-20 18:47:00,273,"I went Friday night and it was great.  It was surprisingly quiet between 4 and 8pm.  With it being relatively quiet, it was easy to get to all the booths and check out what they have, plus talk to the vendors and get a couple questions answered. Went to the 5pm talk by the Johnston brothers and the 6pm talk by Scott Martin.  Both talks were excellent.  Very informative and with the smaller crowd I got time to ask questions at both of the talks.       "
1023530,Handlebarz,2018-02-25 15:52:00,3790,Hey All first I want to thank everyone who took the time to come out and support this all fishing show. The Promoter tries hard to bring in new things to help get interest in the show. I know of three manufactures that pulled out at the last min two were due to family issues (I have no clue what they are)  and the third as they had a conflict with their holiday plans and were out of the country. I had a great time all weekend and was lucky enough to meet many new people face to face for the first time from OFC thanks for taking the time to stop by the booth and say hi. Musky Sunday was a success again with good attendance I'm not sure the actual numbers but when I was there it seemed like a good turn out. They had great seminars all weekend with Salmon day Saturday Musky Sunday and bass university Monday  all days went past noon due to the amount of questions that everyone had for the speakers so I would think that was a good thing. Later in the day each day it was slower but numbers through the weekend were about the same from what I had heard so if you came when it was slower you were lucky. I know we had many customers that had to come back as our booth was to busy. For that I am so grateful as we try and take time with each person and not short them. Just remember all shows are the same the deals are not as good as they were in the 80's 90's and very early 2000's the cost of everything has gone through the roof and our suppliers do not bring their prices down after they go up due to our Canadian $ so the amazing deals have to go. Please let me know what you want to see in these shows that will make them worth your while to come out. I know the owners of it would love the honest feedback so that they can make improvements to it.  Cheers Mike Parker
1023531,Handlebarz,2018-02-25 15:57:00,3790,Some pics from the show last week. Big Jim and I with our usual wide angle selfie Gord Pyzer and my son then some of our Mascot having fun he always brings smiles to the kids big and small.     
1022185,captpierre,2018-02-03 01:40:00,2521,Just checked. It’s in 2 wks. Fri-Mon. Family day weekend. International Centre. Malton
1022221,Pigeontroller,2018-02-03 22:48:00,2793,"Yup, same as last year, and the year before, and the year before....Mississauga!"
1022316,KawarthaAngler,2018-02-05 14:11:00,273,"Just up the road from the International Centre is an excellent burger joint called ""Zets"".  It's been there for many years.  Be sure to grab lunch or dinner there if at the show.  Their burgers and Slouvaki dishes are great. "
1022318,TJQ,2018-02-05 15:18:00,7806,I haven't been in a few years.. sigh  Family day weekend is usually when we get visits...   Used to never miss it.. lol.  its a shame cause its 4 lane all the way now!!
1022391,dintymoore,2018-02-06 00:44:00,62,Haven't been to this show in many years. Can one find some good deals there? I'm in the market for a new reel.
1022393,BillM,2018-02-06 01:34:00,17367,"Love the show, always fun to walk around and see all the new stuff."
1022415,KawarthaAngler,2018-02-06 14:48:00,273,I don't think there are any deals there.  Maybe some but they may be gone by noon on Saturday. It's a great place to talk to the manufacturers and ask detailed technical questions about their products.  I have found it helpful with future purchases or just gaining knowledge on the tech.
1022417,16 Footer,2018-02-06 16:10:00,191,"Going with wife, daughter and two young grand sons. The 4 year old loves fishing and can tell you the name of just about every fish in Ontario."
1022423,Lape0019,2018-02-06 17:33:00,647,"Went last year but she's a long drive from Ottawa. I might go this year but I am waiting on a few buddies to confirm. Otherwise, I'll be up there in July anyway and can hit up the stores that sell what I went when I am there."
1022427,Tjames09,2018-02-06 17:47:00,664,The sportsman show is a better show. I think it’s in March.
1022430,Bass Tard,2018-02-06 18:15:00,128,"I'm going.  Picking up a used 24v trolling motor in the parking lot, and then go walk around.  Usually just buy a tshirt or something."
1022432,Fisherman,2018-02-06 18:49:00,7201,"Great place to go and catch the flue bug, lol. "
1022437,misfish,2018-02-06 23:54:00,29133,"LMAO  I got the shot, but I am still not going. Been to enough of them and have found, wasted gas and time. I do not enjoy them any more. They are 1-2 ,hour walk abouts.  "
1022442,Fisherman,2018-02-07 00:30:00,7201,"Lol, time you can fruitfully expend walking around on the ice finding the right spot with good deals on fish."
1022445,greyhawk,2018-02-07 01:14:00,33,"The good deals at fishing shows have simply disappeared. If deals exist I would suggest you try the final days of the show. Vendors, at least in the past, did not want to lug merchandise back home so good buys could be had. Today many local tackle stores put on their own Fishing Show specials. Give them a try. You may be pleasantly surprised."
1022477,KawarthaAngler,2018-02-07 19:49:00,273, Might find more deals at a show like this (Bowmanville Tackle Swap):  https://www.facebook.com/Bowmanville-Tackle-Swap-and-Fishing-Show-844565995651188/
1022481,Snidley,2018-02-07 20:28:00,620,"There is no ""might"" about it. You will find outstanding deals especially if you are interested in used gear. Look for lures with bite marks, don't buy mono/fluro line as it will be old but braid is often one of the better buys at the show.  2 floors now as well. I bet they get 2500 people."
1022482,outllaw,2018-02-07 20:39:00,1232,will be there to see big mike at handlebarz lures..gotta check out his new colors.
1022484,misfish,2018-02-07 21:23:00,29133,Now these swaps are the place to be. I have gotten some sweet deals. Terry and I went home one day with probly $500 worth of stuff at new and only spent $110. Thats a savings. And nothing was crap.
1022486,Rodbender,2018-02-07 21:31:00,1027,I'll be i Florida same as last 6 years
1022698,Handlebarz,2018-02-12 05:10:00,3790,This show is actually a great show we have been there the last 4 years? I think its been 4 but lost count. Years ago I always thought I had to get a great deal at the show to make it worth the trip but then I found the OFC site and we had the M&G there and I learned that its more then just getting a deal. I love talking to everyone who comes by our booth from little kids to guys who were fishing decades before I was born they all have their musky encounter or their dram of catching one. I get to see friends who I live far away from but we all get to chat over the weekend. You can find some deals there maybe not like the good old days but that is just the industry cost of everything has gone through the roof so that makes the screaming deals less. For the fishermen and women who have everything then they might not get as much out of the shows but for the ones who want to learn they can ask questions from many in the industry to further their knowledge or pick up a new tip that might help them out. We have our Promotional Staff there to help out each of them have their own ways of fishing musky some have their own waters that they catch many big musky on yearly where others that have been on the same waters have never seen a big fish. This is where you can gain from ask many questions and listen to the answers. If your at the show please stop by the Handlebarz booth I would love to get to meet more OFC members who I have not yet met. and always love to see my friends from  years past.  Adam your right Zets is a great place but you better be hungry they fill the trays  Cheers Mike
1022699,Handlebarz,2018-02-12 05:17:00,3790,They also have coupon codes to save $2 the code for the next 3 days are as follows. February 12 and 13 it is SHIMANO 	February 14 it is BERKLEY 	February 15 it is TOMORROW
1022706,Fish Farmer,2018-02-12 11:52:00,2234,"Free parking and $3.00 to get in, See you there bro. I have a great time at the swap, I go just to meet old friends and shoot the I can't remember it I saw anything"
1022710,BlueEye,2018-02-12 13:52:00,338,Mike - do they have many musky booths there?  Thinking of taking family up on Sunday.
1022711,bigugli,2018-02-12 14:00:00,6138,We have a good swap in Ancaster and a decent local show in Ft Erie. Always good deals to be had.
