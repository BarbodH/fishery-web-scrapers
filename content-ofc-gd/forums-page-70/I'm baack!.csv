THat was the primary goal of the trip. Much In Disney is changing to appeal to a new generation who know nothing of Uncle Walt. Some of it good, some not so much. Secondary goal was to get in some fishing.That turned out to be a bust. To start, Disney World is no longer angler friendly. Used to be you could go pitch a few casts in the waters by your hotel. No longer allowed. Only  their B.A.S.S. charters are permitted now, and in limited locations. $270 for 2 hrs. is pretty steep. Next was to be a charter out of St Petes. Day before our booked trip, the captain cancels due to mechanical problems. No offer to find a substitute boat or charter. We could not find any on short notice. Guess I'll set that money aside for a freshwater trip."

1023479,pics,2018-02-24 14:23:00,1268,A hundred bucks plus to go to Disney it isn't worth it for me.. Especially when you have people paying a premium to jump in front of you in line.. Too bad a about the Charter guy.. That's bad business..
