1023648,Fisherman,2018-02-27 00:25:00,7201,I use the 1803 med hvy 8' with the #0 dipsy and it puts a pretty good bend in it.
1023667,Woodsman,2018-02-27 05:17:00,1286,I prefer heavier rods for dipseys. I find the dipseys trip better.
1023674,G.mech,2018-02-27 13:29:00,830,x2....heavier the better.
