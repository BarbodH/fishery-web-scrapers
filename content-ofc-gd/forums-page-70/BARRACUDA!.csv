1023121,OhioFisherman,2018-02-18 17:23:00,6623,"Dang, those teeth might scare a muskie!"
1023123,manitoubass2,2018-02-18 18:29:00,11391,"That's so friggen awesome Simon!!! I'm hyped for you! I'd think twice about standing in that water with that fish for a photo, but I'd do it too. Epic fish, epic photo! Congrats!!!"
1023125,bobowski,2018-02-18 18:45:00,360,Amazing. Thats a great pic
1023146,tomkat,2018-02-18 23:26:00,246,Antigua?
1023159,Carp,2018-02-19 06:25:00,1488,Very nice ! 
1023162,scuro2,2018-02-19 12:04:00,904,Muskies probably attack humans more frequently then Cuda. They have a very specific target in mind when hunting and it ain't humans.
1023165,BlueEye,2018-02-19 13:59:00,338,Wow - that is awesome!!!  Nice fish - congrats!
1023179,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-19 18:49:00,8243,"Congrats Simon, you d' man. What did you use to get that beast? I found they would hit just about any minnow bait when on the hunt like a simple 10 CM floating Rappala, black on silver or chrome, maybe a few split shot and a good Titanium leader. If getting  even the smaller Cuda they don't last long. They will crunch a plastic bait to smithereens. Anything with a flash worked for me. I am never concerned with what else is swimming in the water when I wade in and fish saltwater I am more aware not to step on a Ray and get stung. They bury themselves in the sand and are difficult to see. I kick the sand in front of me when I walk. That's how that guy from Australia who's name I can't recall died. Steve something."

1023245,limeyangler,2018-02-21 00:05:00,5204,"Don't know, was long and heavy, fight was insane, got it all on video, will post when I get back"
1023246,limeyangler,2018-02-21 00:07:00,5204,"Pearl/ pink paddle tail, the beasties love them here"
1023266,limeyangler,2018-02-21 12:08:00,5204,"Yup, Antigua."
1023267,limeyangler,2018-02-21 12:11:00,5204,"It is, thanks to my friend here who does fly-fishing guided tours, we always hook up when I'm here and he took me for a cruise around the mangroves in his modified skiff, was a hoot going through 4' waves on basically a raft with a 4hp on it."
1023268,limeyangler,2018-02-21 12:20:00,5204,"Lol, no doubt. Was not eaten though as there is a risk of poisoning from large predatory reef fish. I thought it was just a combination of local superstitions and religious taboos that had combined to make the Barracuda the hated fish( similar to how disdainful NW Ontarians can be about pike) but a quick search on Google a couple of years ago proved my assumptions dangerously wrong. https://www.emedicinehealth.com/wilderness_ciguatera_toxin/article_em.htm"
1023357,SirCranksalot,2018-02-22 21:21:00,3291,"I came face to face with 1 when I was snorkelling in the Bahamas. I had been told that they rarely, if ever, attack humans but I backed off anyway---not taking any chances!! Nice looking fish!! I guess a steel leader would be 'highly recommended!!"
