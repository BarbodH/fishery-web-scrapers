1023264,16 Footer,2018-02-21 11:45:00,191,My son In law and 3 buddies just returned from their annual trip to Hyatt's huts. They caught lots of small pike and all the walleye were under slot. They did not look too happy with a few perch they brought back. They also said Rob Hyatt is selling his hut business but keeping his chalet.
1023274,Rod Caster,2018-02-21 14:46:00,5784,"Yep, Nipissing can be tough if your looking to go home with a full feed. If you like being busy, catching multiple-species and potentially landing a big fish, then Nip is great!"
1023276,Sterling,2018-02-21 16:53:00,477,"Nipissing is primarily a catch and release fishery, at least for walleye. No fault of the outfitters. They have it rough with the new slot size, it really impacts their business."
1023285,Joeytier,2018-02-21 18:03:00,3990,"Hyatt is apparently done at the end of this month, and the new owner will be taking it over for the start of next season.  I wouldn't except any change in the quality of the operation."
1023397,floater,2018-02-23 12:30:00,220,"Just got back from three days at Nippising. The bite was dead for two days. Only managed 4 perch the first two days. The third day they woke up. We managed 5 pickerel, four under the slot and one 23 inch, and about 50 jumbo perch. No pike or even mud puppies this year. Water was real murky and couldn't see more than 3 feet on the camera. Nice hut set ups though so we keep going back."
