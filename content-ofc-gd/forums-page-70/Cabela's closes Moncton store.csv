1023360,kickingfrog,2018-02-22 22:07:00,8333,While the Barrie Cabela's leaves me wanting more I'd hate to see it close.
1023367,Dutch01,2018-02-22 23:04:00,1431,"I know how they feel a little anyways. I know LeBaron wasn't ""all that"" but they were the only thing in Markham. I wish it was still there."
1023374,adempsey,2018-02-23 01:26:00,1498,"Anyone use Cabela's or BPS gift cards at the opposite location? I believe I read online that you can, just wondering if any has actually been through that. I really liked going to LeBaron.  They had items I could only get there and the prices were always decent.  Although, I moved from Toronto years ago and never returned after that.  I think Sail is decent enough though."
1023378,Dutch01,2018-02-23 02:23:00,1431,Yeah Sail is pretty good and where I try to go now (at least they're Canadian owned) but it's a lot longer driver to Oshawa than the old LeBaron.
1023392,GBW,2018-02-23 03:45:00,8460,"It is back, same location, new owners and a new name!!  *edit to add* Well It's not LeBarons but a new shop in the same spot"
1023427,Dutch01,2018-02-23 19:07:00,1431,"I heard that, but I heard it's the gun shop guys that opened it and fishing is more of an afterthought....I suppose I should go check for myself....."
1023457,misfish,2018-02-23 22:03:00,29133,"Good question. Guess I,ll go and see if my BPS gift card is good or not."
