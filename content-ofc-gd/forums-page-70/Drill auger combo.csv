1022132,SirCranksalot,2018-01-31 23:04:00,3291,"I have an ordinary 18v Dewalt with Ni-Cad batts rated at 1.5 A-H. I'm trying to figure out if it's worth buying a Clam plate for it. Bigger cap'y batts seem to be avail on-line fairly cheap if I need 1 or 2. Then again, I don't tend to drill many holes. I have a 6"" Mora/Normark.  Comments/suggestions?"
1022134,misfish,2018-01-31 23:34:00,29133,"With a 6"" you will be fine. Like you said. Not many holes.  As you know already, I started with just the drill. Then went to the plate when I upgraded when I went to the 8"". Clam plate, bigger drill power. If your only going out once in a while, and only doing a few holes, yer good. I would how ever, up grade the battery. XRP. More juice."
1022136,Tjames09,2018-02-01 00:11:00,664,"I have a 1.5ah battery for mine. I get 10 holes of about 12-14"" of good black ice, and a 6"" auger. clam plate."
1022147,Shloim,2018-02-01 03:20:00,515,Look atvthis thing they came out with! Clam rocks! http://stores.clamoutdoors.com/clam/augers/conversion-kit-gear-box.html
1022148,BillM,2018-02-01 03:28:00,17367,Brian should have patented the one he made me a few years ago.   Connects to my 8in Fin-bore and my DeWalt 20v rips through 18inches of ice with ease.
1022151,Shloim,2018-02-01 11:23:00,515,Indeed! But he was too busy fishing!
1022155,SirCranksalot,2018-02-01 14:26:00,3291,"Hmmm---I'd be very interested in this! For one thing, I quite enjoy making things. Heck, I even made a DIY 'jawjacker' that I can't be bothered using! Second--I was searching on the net and it seems most everybody is sold out of Clam plates.  I did drill a couple of holes about  years ago but the potential for a serious wrist injury scared me off. I just had the little adapter from CTC."
1022161,misfish,2018-02-01 15:55:00,29133,Cliff and I tried to sell it off to a company. Never heard back.
1022183,misfish,2018-02-03 00:40:00,29133,"Since I couldn't find the finbor 3 6"" I wanted, I bought another brand. I will be testing it out in the morning. I will be sight fishing, so I will be bringing both the 8"" and 6"". The 8"" for seeing and the 6"" for the ducer.  That is the plan right now, but will be trying a side by side hole, or a mickey. Comparison video will be coming in the next 24 hours.  "
1022184,misfish,2018-02-03 00:49:00,29133,I just gave away my prototype. The first I ever made.
1022194,SirCranksalot,2018-02-03 15:21:00,3291,"Re-thinking this a bit. By the time I spend $100 on a Clam plate and more on bigger batt(s), I might be better buying a Ridgid 18 V. Apparently it has a side handle that can be used to brace against the torque and avoid wrist injury. Comments? Thx"
1022201,misfish,2018-02-03 18:07:00,29133,"Comment is NOPE. You can still get twisted. I was talking to a buddy yesterday that was using the handle. After he seen the plate, he is looking for one now.  I bought a BPS 6"" off of Costa this morning. Took the 8"" off and put the 6"" on. OMG. For a auger that is just straight blades, it cut through 16"" of ice in seconds. I could not believe it. I didnt even apply pressure. Just the weight of the plate and drill was way more then it needed to cut a hole. Need to work on my side by side holes."
1022212,Sinker,2018-02-03 20:07:00,8692,The rigid drills have lifetime warranty.
1022213,SirCranksalot,2018-02-03 20:09:00,3291,I'm surprised. I thought that having 2 hands on the drill would prevent any twist.
1022215,misfish,2018-02-03 20:41:00,29133,I was referring to your WRIST
1022217,SirCranksalot,2018-02-03 21:54:00,3291,"Sorry for the confusion. What I was trying to say was that I thought that, with the extension handle as well as the normal handle , you could use both hands on the drill and that would prevent any wrist injury."
1022219,misfish,2018-02-03 22:35:00,29133,LOL No confusion. Theres a reason many have gone to the clam.  Wait til next season to buy one. Do not hesitate. BUY IT 
1022236,mike rousseau,2018-02-04 02:02:00,4661,Just got one set up today  got a Canadian tire MAXIMUM 20v brushless drill on sale today and the little $15 fitting to connect to my 6” fin bor III  I charged it up and tested it tonight  20 holes in 18” of ice on the 2ah battery they come with  with the 2 batteries charged I doubt I’ll ever run outta juice  and holy hell if it bites that drill kicks so pay attention!!!! i have the extra handle on (hammer drill handle?) and it helped a lot too... I imaging drilling 20-40 holes without it would cause wrist pains
1023122,farsider,2018-02-18 17:56:00,456,"So, will they just sell this next year with the conversion plate as a package? Could be slick.   Cheers, Mark"
1023215,Shloim,2018-02-20 03:12:00,515,Im not sure the gear box was even sold in Canada this year....
1023239,misfish,2018-02-20 22:07:00,29133,The first round of conversion boxes were a bust. Recall. They exploded inside. Reviews on youtube seem to say they have fixed the problem with the new gen 2 one. I would like to see a 1 year warranty on them before I go and buy one.
