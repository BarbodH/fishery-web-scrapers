1023198,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-02-19 22:56:00,48,"I've got a lure that someone gave me after he found it stuck on his sailboat. It's been hanging in my garage for 4 years and I finally got sick of looking at it and checked it out today. It's an OSP Rudra 130 SP. Solid feeling rattling suspending jerkbait.  Yellow body, hazy purple back, orange belly. I wish I cleaned up sooner after inspecting it today. I've never heard of this company. Everything I find online is Russian or Japanese. Does anyone have experience with these or know if they're any good?  Thanks!    "

1023200,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-02-19 23:04:00,48,I managed to figure that part out. Curious if anyone knows if they're any good.
1023201,misfish,2018-02-19 23:10:00,29133,Looks like a great jerk bait. They seem to have a great variety of stuff on their site.
1023202,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-02-19 23:27:00,48,Agreed. Looks like it will be good for pike. It's 3/4 ounce so it will cast nicely from shore. Slapped new hooks on it. Will have to find out for myself if it's a winner.

1023206,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-02-20 00:40:00,48,"Knowing how rare it is in North America, it's probably never going to see water like my Vision Onetens!"
1023209,OhioFisherman,2018-02-20 02:00:00,6623,"Changing the hooks on some lures can throw off their action, you have to be careful with hook size and weight. No idea how that lure would work with a steel or floro leader, throwing expensive bass lures around toothy fish is a bad plan to me."
1023211,BillM,2018-02-20 02:19:00,17367,Gotta be careful with hooks on Japanese lures like mentioned above.  I've swapped hooks on a few Yellow Magic poppers and it completely changes the action.
1023212,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-02-20 02:29:00,48,Had to change them. Hooks looked like the lure was outside for a while. Put on same size VMCs I took off a Rapala. I'll try other ones if it seems to swim funny after that.

1023230,Snidley,2018-02-20 17:47:00,620,"HPF crank , Power Dunk crank and Asura jerkbait are all big winners especially for Steelhead. They catch bass too of course. A friend uses the Rudra and says it's good too. They are all VERY expensive even for a Japanese  lure. HPF cranks are a common knockoff crank and I'll bet even the knockoffs are good and cost $2 vs $20  for the real deal"
1023521,singingdog,2018-02-25 13:14:00,1047,"I find OSP can be ""day savers"", but often very finicky. I have a couple of the power dunks that can turn on a finicky bite, but they need to be constantly tuned to run true."
1023522,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-02-25 13:30:00,48,Good to know! Took mine out for a test drive yesterday and loved it. Well crafted lure!!
1023641,buick14,2018-02-26 23:25:00,741,You will like it.  Heck of a lure and company
