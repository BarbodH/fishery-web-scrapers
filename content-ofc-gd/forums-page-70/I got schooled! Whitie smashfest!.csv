What a game changer! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFJzSav2lFI"
1022938,Bondar,2018-02-15 08:15:00,817,Haha wacked em . Great vid Steve
1022946,Sterling,2018-02-15 13:05:00,477,"Great video, hard to find these meegs jigs online, damn."
1022950,AKRISONER,2018-02-15 13:42:00,5558,im really interested in what it was specifically that you changed technique wise to bring you so much success...unreal vid.
1022954,floater,2018-02-15 13:59:00,220,Now a video on the technique please! I'm in the same boat. Been trying the original meegs and never got a fish on them.
1022977,misfish,2018-02-15 17:25:00,29133,"Exactly. James does great detailing as far as the body goes.   Guys, if you watch the video again, you will see the way to fish it. And if you know goby patterns, then you should know how the jig is fished. Big hint. They dont have bladders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Steve that was insane dude."
1022980,Tomcat,2018-02-15 18:20:00,395,"Great videos - thanks. One question please. I don't ice fish nor have I ever fished Lake Simcoe. Do you guys ever keep whities or lakers and if so, how do you select the ones you will keep?"
1022983,AKRISONER,2018-02-15 18:29:00,5558,"...ive fished goby patterns for smallies before, and now I think a lightbulb just went off in my head."
1022985,TJQ,2018-02-15 19:08:00,7806,Great Video Steve!! Im gonna share it in a few places!! 
1022986,Acountdeleted,2018-02-15 19:19:00,2562,Man does this ever give me the itch. A few vids I have seen online and I'm starting to think of what I may be doing wrong. Gotta love when the action is non-stop like that. Great vid.
1022990,misfish,2018-02-15 20:40:00,29133,"""Pattern"" was wrong word I take it SIR. LOL"
1023075,cl_fishin,2018-02-17 02:00:00,138,Nicely done....looked like fun
1023113,Out4Trout,2018-02-18 04:18:00,98,Awesome video - the small things can sure make a big difference!! 
1023256,PUMP KNOWS,2018-02-21 03:09:00,937,Awesome vid.  I tried my luck last week but I couldn't get them to bite.  I think I was over working the meegs.  I hope to get out again before the ice melts.  They have a few colours in the 1/2oz here... https://coolwatersfishingproducts.ca/collections/meegs-lures/products/meegs-jigs
1023257,BillM,2018-02-21 04:39:00,17367,"Steve, what are you tipping the Meegs with?  Looks like a small tube jig of some sort?"
1023321,Bondar,2018-02-22 09:08:00,817,"Crappie sized tubes . 2"" or so"
1023332,BillM,2018-02-22 16:03:00,17367,Lucky I've got a million of those    Now just to find a few Meegs.  Surprised I don't have any in my ice box to be honest.
1023334,Sinker,2018-02-22 16:39:00,8692,"Great video. I was really surprised you didn't know how to work that jig right. I thought of all people, you would know the trick to make it catch fish. They are a real fish magnet. I don't hit the lake without one rigged. I have hundreds of dollars worth of them in my box. They catch every kind of fish too, not just whities and lakers. I even use them on open water for vertical jigging all kinds of fish.  S."
