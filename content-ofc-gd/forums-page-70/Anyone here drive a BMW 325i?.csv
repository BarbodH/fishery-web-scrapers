She found it online at A Brantford Ford dealer, made a call, asked all the right questions, researched it online for hours, went to see it Saturday. Took it for a spin on the 401 and around town. She made a good deal below market value and had the dealer do a few touch ups I missed and paint the entire hood due to chips. Made sure it came with 2 keyless entry fobs and will pick it up Friday. I'm proud of her. It won't pulls G's and weld you in the seat like she likes but I get my truck back after the winter. AT"

They are pretty peppy if you ask me.  I was on a ticketless streak for 10 years until I rented a sonata for a trip last summer. ended up with 2 tickets on that trip to Alberta.  One was a traffic camera and one while overtaking someone on the rural roads of Saskatchewan Sorry OI I didn't get to reply to your post about the Agera.  Its actually made by Koenigsegg company, but they are swedish like Volvo so pretty close.  Volvo has come a long way from their old boxy cars, and the power output is pretty impressive.  The new xc90 hybrid puts out 400 hp and can keep up with some pretty fast cars out there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdZXOF7mVU  check out this video"

Beautiful looking design (ever seen an art-deco looking tractor?), and it was emphasized several times that it was cheap to run / easy to maintain and repair. Now you can't even change the battery in a German vehicle without going through a trained mechanic? Can someone explain to me how this is progress?

The old man kicked him out of his office and Mr. Lamborghini swore to beat Ferrari at it's own game on and off the race track and actually did for a time . The German cars were complicated to work on years ago, not just lately. My 69' 280S had manual windows. The window came off the track. There was a special tool to pop the fasteners off to get the door panel free, then there was about 3 layers of plastic, insulation and fibre board on to get to the window. But when you close a door on a Benz you can hear the quality and over engineering even back then. Those Becker AM, FM radio/cassette players that they used were as good as todays Bose units, no actually they were better. Most people that have never owned one are usually the first to criticize them. The Lamborghini tractor history below. Their tractors looked similar as the Porche tractor back then Tom. http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/03/lamborghini-cars-were-a-result-of-a-tractor-company-owners-frustration-with-Ferrari/"

I love tinkering with cars and in my pre-career years spent most of my spare time with grease and engine oil under my nails.  Between my my brother, myself and my buddies we basically fixed every part on a long list of cars (we were gluttons for punishment).  Here is my list.  I will have the years wrong no doubt, but pretty close.  In no particilar order: A series of VW beetles in the 70's, SAAB 900, VW Microbus, Jeep CJ5, Opel GT, Renault Fuego,  Chevy Monza, Chrysler New Yorker,  1953 Chev, 1984 Olds Cutlass Ciera, Cadillac Cimarron. Needless to say, not going down that path when I retire! When I retire, I will probably look for a early 70s muscle car.  Maybe a Chevelle.  And do a resto-mod kind of thing.  Probably buy someone else's partly finished project. A buddy of mine is doing that to an early 70's GTO.  Its a pretty neat ride now."

It didn't used to like to start after a snap freeze, but other than that it was awesome. It looked great and also handed like a go-cart. On a twisty road I could run with my buddies 5.0 even though I had nowhere near the power. It was tight. More recently I leased and then bought out a 2009 323i. It was a ""stripper"", only two options, heated seats and sunroof. I had to get it shipped from the factory in Germany to get standard! I would have liked more power but it was not in the budget and the manual trans made it fun if not fast. With good snow tires it was truly amazing in winter.

Especially because manufacturers love to do things like change computer boards between models to add in more features. And since so many models come standard with more and more advanced electronic bells and whistles it's going to get worse and worse. It's like we're going backwards.

Fast forward a few years and she mentions that the car is not running right and could he have a look. So he asks her a few questions regarding how she maintains the vehicle. Things like oil changes etc... this was in the late 70's. Come to find that in the entire time she owned the car, she never once changed the oil! She ended up at a shop and when the mechanic checked the oil, it was pure sludge. Mechanic refused to change the oil saying that doing so would completely bugger up all the seals as the only thing keeping them tight, was the sludge. She drove it until it died a year later. Never did get an oil change. HH"

I don't drive imports or NA sports sedans because of the status thing, I want to drive my car not have it drive me. For many it's to get from A to B.

By the way, the BMW and Benz snobs at work will tell me that their cars are great, but they seem to be coming in late after dropping their cars off an awful lot.  (typing this I remember another BMW story.  I have hundreds.  For about two years, the rear seat floors would be soaking wet in the winter.  I mentioned it every time I went in (which was a lot).  They told me I should kick the snow off my feet before getting in the car.  I said, how does that explain the passenger rear seat?  Anyway went on for at least 2 winters.  So I googled wet carpets in rear of BMW X5.  Turns out there was a known problem and the dealers would fix it if you complained.  Get this.... the rear doors fill up with water and the design of the door is that they glue an inner liner of thin plastic over the inside of the door before installing the interior.  Their glue failed and they new it. So when I went in the next time I told them I had googled the problem, and they needed to fix it.  And they did.  It took 2 years to get that fixed.  I have many more.  I have four inches of service invoices that I keep. Anyway, I just may go for another MDX this time around.  The expression ""runs like a Honda"" is not an urban myth."

When the AC goes out at 100K that 900 buck service turns into a 2500 buck or more repair. Years ago I read an article in Motor Trend (when you had to flip pages) there was an 86' 3 series I read about that has 1 million miles on it.

1022587,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-09 21:18:00,8243,"Whatever I buy will be a weekender. I know only too well the pitfalls of European cars not new. Been towing them home for 45 years. My very first car I bought was a 67' MGB, blew the timing chain on the QEW the week after I bought it, I paid $500.00 for the car in the summer of 73'. I repaired that sold it and bought a 72' TR6 the same summer from the British Leyland dealer in Hamilton for $3200.00. I must have liked pain. Still must. I will hold off until spring after we sell and get settled in the new place. I might even have some money in the bank then! If I decide to sell the boat I will put it towards a different toy. These days I don't really need my own boat, the boys told me I always have an open seat in one of their many boats. We are always arguing about which of our boats to take out. One of the few advantages of aging. You know more freinds with boats!"
1022612,Canuck,2018-02-10 13:05:00,491,"I had only one BMW.  A 2007 X5 I bought new.  Last BMW I will own.  I should have sold it when the warranty ended since it had many many many repairs while under warranty.  But I buy cars and try to keep them 10 years.  I finally had to bail on the X5.  It was costing more in repairs each year than I could afford.  It was truly insane.  The last trip in to the slealership was to replace a cracked coolant overflow container (how many times do you see something like that break???).  I knew it would be expensive, so I braced my self when the estimate call came.  $450.  Yes to replace a piece of plastic.  That's BMW.  But wait there is more.    The dealer ""noticed"" a few other things that should be done.  Oil pan leaks, head gasket leaks, bushings, etc etc.  The total estimate was........ wait for it...............$9,500. I sold it within 2 weeks.  The buyer was a Lebanese buyer of overseas cars.  It was shipped to Beirut to be sold there.  Good riddance. I did however, rent a brand new BMW 430i convertible in San Francisco last April for my bucket list drive down Highway 1 in California.  That was a fantastic car to drive.  Perfect for that trip.  When I got home I was tempted, but I dug out that X5 estimate (I am saving it, in case I ever think I should buy another one), shook my head and moved on. BMW's are FANTASTIC cars to drive.  But HORRIBLE cars to own."
1022614,DanD,2018-02-10 13:28:00,2223,"I know I'd miss this old Chevy; she's at the spaw (body shop) this winter, having a face lift, Built in Oshawa in 1950; by Canadians for Canadians. Heaters were an option that was only offered in the Canadian plants. In the States, a heater was a dealer installed option. LOL Dan. "

Very DIY friendly, and not to mention, very safe!  https://www.kijiji.ca/v-cars-trucks/oakville-halton-region/2004-volvo-c70-ht/1235836673?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true "
1022625,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-10 18:01:00,8243,"Nice ride Huzz. A safe car? You have never seen my wife drive. People I have never met have asked me to tell her to slow down. ""You tell her."" It must be said that I don't condone speeding and I have told her to slow down until I'm blue in the face. The last ticket she got the Cop asked her what's the rush? ""I knew you were here waiting for me so I got here ASAP."" I give up. But do admit she has slowed down quite a bit when our insurance skyrocketed 10 years ago. Back to the normal too expensive now. "
1022627,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-10 18:14:00,8243,"We have spoken about your ride before. My Uncle and Dad had one when I was a kid. Always loved the soft lines. Cars of that era were works of Art. The car looks like it's moving when parked. When I was a kid Dad had a 50' Chevy like yours, a 55' Chevy 2 door hardtop, green on white and a 59' Chev wagon, forest green. I learned to drive on the 65' Impala. The next car he bought was a 69' Impala SS. He has always loved nice cars. That we have in common. Right up to his last vehicle at age 85' he has always asked me to shop with him. I asked the salesman at Queenston Chev Olds in 66' I was 11, how much he would give me for my bike towards the car? He's 90 now (91 in April) and wants to go car shopping with me. Ask him what he misses the most now and he says driving."
1022633,captpierre,2018-02-10 21:32:00,2521,Unless you are locked into rear wheel drive think about a used Scion or Lexus.  Considerably more reliable and also fun to drive.
1022646,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-11 01:38:00,8243,"I owned a 86' 3 series BMW convertible, it never cost me anymore than any other cars as far as reliability went. The least reliable car was my wife's 98' Pontiac Grand Prix bought in 2000 low K's, I bet I paid almost twice for that car. From alternators going out every year to power window switches frying. The rotors wore like they were made of wood. Those 3.8's were a tank though. All the windows leaked, and, and, and. Next worse was a 79' Audi 5000 bought in 80', how does a frame crack at 75,000 kms? I didn't drive it hard. It was breaking down constantly. I found out many VW parts fit at 50% of the cost as OEM parts from Audi thank goodness. The BMW was one of the most reliable cars I ever owned, but you have to do the service. I had her for 10 years. In 92' I owned 6 cars, sold all but the Benz and my daily driver, bought a rental home with a good down stroke. See below, 1969 Mercedes Benz 280.Some confuse scheduled service with unreliable. There can be a lemon in the basket of cherries sometimes. I'll tell you about sticker shock, what they want for a 15 to 18 year old Jeep TJ with high K's floored me. 6 to 10 thousand dollars, Wowza. I'll take my chances on a rag top BMW compared to a Jeep. Yes I drove a YJ for a few years. Fun yes but not that much for the price today. Never considered a Lexus or Scion. I don't think Scion has a convertible. Service on either wouldn't be any less than a European sports car I imagine. "

1022689,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-12 02:42:00,8243,"I'd drive one of those Acura's that have stolen some Pina Farina designs. You don't see many around. what are they called SX something? We drove a 011' XTS Caddy and a 14' the other day. Even my wife said it is a boring car. It drives like a 1980's Cadillac, loose, bulky and boring. Tomorrow I am going to look at a CTS and an ATS, weather permitting. It really is a good time of year to test drive a car, especially a rear wheeler. When I asked the guy what they would give me for my Silverado I knew it wasn't going to be good but what he offered was ridiculous, 12 grand for a 2011 4X4 crew cab, chrome package with 100K, still under extended warranty. I told him if he had any I will take 3. He's only doing his job. They would turn around and ship it south and make a quick 8K, minimum. Canuck, sorry about your luck. I have wanted to do that entire coastal drive too, Seattle to Tijuana . Always has been on my wish list since I drove about 100 miles on Pacific 1 as a passenger in the 70's and I don't remember much of it, cheap Tequila . I wish manufacturers would stick to what they do best, manufacture cars not SUV's, crossovers whatever that means, or trucks. But they must compete. Stick a sliding door on the side and voila, a mini van. I have noticed many of these companies don't do well on their crossover/mini-van clones. Lamborghini actually has a 650 HP SUV out this year. They were however an Italian Tractor producer before they started making Super Bulls when Mr. Lamborghini was kicked out of Enzo Ferrari's office. That gave him incentive to beat Ferrari nd he did for a few years racing. Old man Enzo said ""We are a race car company that makes passenger cars on the side."""
