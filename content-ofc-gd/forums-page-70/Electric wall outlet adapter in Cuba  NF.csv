1023168,lew,2018-02-19 16:58:00,12766,"Hi guys, my wife is heading to Cuba next week and she's been told she needs to take some sort of adapter with her to plug in a tablet in the hotel room. Anyone know what type she needs ??"
1023169,lew,2018-02-19 17:11:00,12766,"Looks like I found my answer, it seems most hotel outlets in Cuba are 220 so I need to get a converter to drop it down to 110."
1023172,Tom S,2018-02-19 17:46:00,362,Check the power supply for the tablet - most power supplies these days are rated for a wide range of voltages and can probably handle 220V. If that's the case you just need a plug adapter (~$25).
1023173,lew,2018-02-19 17:56:00,12766,"Thanks Tom, on the back of the tablet it says ""rated 5.1V---2.1 A Max"" Does that tell you anything ??"
1023175,Tom S,2018-02-19 18:28:00,362,"No, that's the output. It should say somewhere on the serial plate something like '100-240V - 50/60Hz' for input."
1023176,John Bacon,2018-02-19 18:36:00,3277,I don't remember needing an adapter.  I think most hotels have 110v North American outlets as well as 220v.  	I just sent an email to a couple that got back from Cuba on Saturday.
1023178,lew,2018-02-19 18:48:00,12766,"Thanks Tom & John I found it in tiny print on the adapter Tom, it says 100-240V - 50/60 Hz so I'm assuming she's good to go without the converter ? Thanks to you too John."
1023181,John Bacon,2018-02-19 19:26:00,3277,"Okay, here is what my friend had to say, ""Hi John. No the outlets were all 220V. They did accept our regular and grounded plugs. HOWEVER if you are only have adapters for things like phones, tablets or laptops you should check the voltage requirements as all of ours were OK with 110 or 220 V."""
1023184,lew,2018-02-19 19:47:00,12766,"Thanks John, appreciate that."
1023188,misfish,2018-02-19 20:22:00,29133,"The wifes away means, that Lew will be coming out of the closet and going ice fishing."
1023189,crappieperchhunter,2018-02-19 20:33:00,2582,LOL. Beat me to it Brian.  And BTW Lew just so you get the full effect I'll let you drag all my stuff out
1023190,misfish,2018-02-19 20:38:00,29133,"Hell, I,ll drag it all out if he would just give it another go. He is retired after all."
1023195,lew,2018-02-19 22:09:00,12766,"C'mon guys, I've been ice fishing twice....1st time & last time"
1023208,Tom S,2018-02-20 01:32:00,362,"Sorry, got pulled away at a family event. Yep, you should be good to go. As John mentioned, most resorts have outlets that should accept the plugs without adapters."
1023214,captpierre,2018-02-20 02:40:00,2521,Hey Lew. Was in Cuba recently. Outlets were 220v. The built in hair dryer had a 110 outlet in the unit. 
1023218,scuro2,2018-02-20 06:03:00,904,Exactly! Every hotel has at least one 110 volt outlet in the bathroom for what is assumed is the hairdryer but can be used for other things.
