I use my fly rod mostly but a spinning rod works great as well. Small spoons and spinners worked well. Small and flashy is the key as I found. I'm heading down Monday to Mexico and plan to do some shore fishing again this year. I wa at Barcelo Maya last year and to the right of the resort when you are on the beach there is a rock outcrop, fish there. Shallow is best 2-4 fow. You will love the resort! "
