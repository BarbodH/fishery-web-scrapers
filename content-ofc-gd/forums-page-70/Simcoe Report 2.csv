1023595,jimmer,2018-02-26 17:49:00,2730,"Well I reported last week on my trip out to catch perch and the poor results from that trip.  I headed out again on Sunday with a friend (no hut rental) and we decided to go for whitefish instead as the target species. Well, Simcoe sure can change its tune quickly.  My friend hooked up before I even had a chance to get my line in the water.  He had 4 before I even had a bite.  The total for the day was over 10, but we lost count on the near misses.  Those whities sure seemed active and we went with the usual rig that works.  I even caught a ling that weighed in at 5lb 14oz.  The largest whitie was 6lb 11oz.  I would have to say that it was my best day ever on Simcoe."
1023597,TJQ,2018-02-26 17:54:00,7806,Nice!!!  Warm days too!!
1023604,AKRISONER,2018-02-26 19:23:00,5558,"damn well done jim lol can be frustrating when you cant even catch perch, but then you go and hammer whities. Right on, i think the whole season has turned the corner..after a ridiculously slow January and start to February, i went out this weekend and had a double header tip up bite and non stop action on the perch and walleye."
1023608,BillM,2018-02-26 19:57:00,17367,January was on fire out on Simcoe.   Probably one of the best seasons for lakers/whitefish in a long time.
1023619,misfish,2018-02-26 21:03:00,29133,"Yup, and it even hotter now. So is this weather.  Nice outing Jim."
1023622,PUMP KNOWS,2018-02-26 21:30:00,937,Awesome!  I hope it cools right up one last time so I can get back out on the ice.  I finally caught my first fish on the ice last week and it was a whitie.
1023652,huzzsaba,2018-02-27 00:39:00,884," Way to rub it in guys lol! Just kidding, I'm happy you guys caught some of the bigger fish. Was hoping to get out for my second chance at my first laker/whitefish.  Will have to wait till next season. On a positive note, I also caught a few new species this winter. Pike, and herring. .   "
1023659,BillM,2018-02-27 02:05:00,17367,"Hows your access holding up?  I haven't been down there but it can't be good, lol"
1023671,misfish,2018-02-27 10:56:00,29133,Donesville.
1023676,jimmer,2018-02-27 13:43:00,2730,The access we used on the east side of the lake was horrible.  Had to drive through a huge puddle before getting up on some waterless ice.  The pressure cracks were also getting sketchy.  Lots of ice otherwise.
1023683,BillM,2018-02-27 14:43:00,17367,"Yeah seems like the main lake will most likely still be ok (I think I saw like 25inches out there) but the accesses near shore are going to hold people back. Ah well, time to dust off the boat and steelhead gear."
1023722,Chuck Enwinde,2018-02-28 06:00:00,247,"Nice going Jimmer .  Access on the west side was not great either, you'd need a plank to get on now where I was.  Ice was still 16"" but the top 2"" was mush by the afternoon."
1023755,ROOK,2018-02-28 19:28:00,55,Would it be possible to know what access on the west side you used so others can decide to look for better access than that location ???  I mean if it really was that bad that you need a plank. I assume other areas may not need a plank to gain access onto the ice..  thanks
1023768,misfish,2018-02-28 23:00:00,29133,"We may require to use a plank this weekend, but Im not inclined to share the location. There are other access spots that do not, but we prefer to not walk a mile or 2 to get to our spot."
