I have seen with my own eyes a regular at the pier catch a few rainbows with a spoon in the fall last year, but others on the same pier recommend using roe at this time of the year saying that since the water is cold, they may not want to chase a spoon. So, what do you recommend in the winter/spring?  use the spoon or head out and get some stuff to make roe bags?  I have tons of roe from a salmon my friend caught in the fall.  thanks"
1023621,Garnet,2018-02-26 21:24:00,2056,Roe bags either off a float  or with floaters in it. If you hit a day spoons cranks might work. Flys and just about anything that hits water might work...................except frog don't think that will work.
