254768,chickenhawk,2008-10-02 20:15:00,612,I remember somebody posted on here last year during the salmon run with pictures of an asian couple who had been spearing fish.  Just wondering whatever came of that.....if there were any charges made or not?  Anyways let me know....    Hawk

254778,chickenhawk,2008-10-02 21:02:00,612,darn...but seriously....did the MNR ever get back to you? can't remember who posted it....
254779,kemper,2008-10-02 21:08:00,2232,"I also remember this post, and if I had to guess nothing ever came of it.  I have called MNR on several occasions about a man netting salmon where I fish, same guy every time and same response from the MNR. ""we will look into it""  Simple problem, they are WAY understaffed"
254784,chickenhawk,2008-10-02 21:20:00,612,"lol i thought that is what TIPS is for is so that they can charge the people who pull stunts like that.....rather than ""look into it""....geez"
