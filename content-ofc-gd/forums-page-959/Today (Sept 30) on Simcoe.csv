He was launching from the east side and he picked me up from the end of hwy 89 shortly before 7 am and we headed up to try our luck around fox island .  Big rollers our of the north and rain off and on made for not the most pleasant conditions .Although peter's big Pro vee sure  is a nice comfortable boat to fish out of . we fished hard for a couple of hours with one little perch to show for it .  spent the rest of the morning looking for Pike in Cooks Bay .One small one in the boat, I had a larger one on for a few seconds and  a couple of more Perch .We called it a day just before noon .  Thanks again peter , hope you made out of the launch ok .And don't forget those rain pants next time . Hopefully we can connect on the water again soon.  Sorry no pics as it was way to wet to try .  TB"
