254470,Greencoachdog,2008-10-01 23:32:00,8163,"I've noticed that most of the people that fuss about Chinese made stuff are the folks that are buying it... and if they wouldn't buy it, there wouldn't be a market for it!  If you want to or think you're saving a dollar or two, that's fine! Just don't fuss about it!  Here in the U.S everything has the country of origin printed or stamped on it so you can see it before you buy it. If the country of origin isn't printed on something you're thinking about buying... take a wild guess as to where it was made, especially if the price is low.  China is the worlds machine shop, get used to it! They do make a lot of lower grade stuff, but it's not as bad as some of the stuff made in Afganistan or India!  China also makes some decent grade stuff. Chinese firearms can be a good deal if you know what to look for."
254479,misfish,2008-10-02 00:03:00,29133,"Thing to watch these days. Made in China means, made by others specs( american/canadian whom ever) Those that are marked or stamped,made by China,these products are made much better and to perfection. Dont believe,do your research. I have it first hand,and am very impressed by some of the quality I have been shown."

Our standard of living will be nil, we will be working for peanuts, and countries will be sending work here as we are now the cheapest labour in the world. Then the circle will start all over again. I loose sleep over this crap. Jim"
254516,Dabluz,2008-10-02 02:22:00,701,  We become 3rd world nation and it will be China's turn to send emergency supplies to keep us barely alive.  China will send journalists and their camera crews to film how abject we have become.  Chinese people will offer to adopt our kids.  Pigs and chickens will be household pets.

254540,Wild,2008-10-02 03:44:00,704,Also keep in mind that made in USA does not necessarily mean made as the parts could come  from overseas and only assembled in the USA.  It has only been what 20-30 years since the only durable products from China were crude cast iron parts and look how fast technology has progressed. India is now beginning to produce fair cast iron castings so what's next? Woods used to be a Canadian made product and now my dining tent is made in Bangladesh!

254545,bigugli,2008-10-02 04:04:00,6138,"Actually, a lot of your high end giftware, gardening and Xmas goods are Chinese made. If the wholesale cost of some trinket was $1, the profit margin is set at 100%, then the shipping and duties are factored in at 300-400% over cost (Lower if you bought in bulk).  How else do you think C.T can retail a rod and reel at $29.99 and then clear it at $12.99 That $1.99 birdie for your  Xmas tree had a wholesale price of $.40, then it got marked up.  China is not going to get theirs, we just keep paying the added difference."

254589,Wild,2008-10-02 12:20:00,704,As are many ingredients in our processed food nowadays. Poisons that are banned in N America are still used in China and imported and accepted here thanks to our lousy food inspection agency. Farmed fish in China have levels of banned poisons in them too.
254594,bigugli,2008-10-02 12:41:00,6138,"But we keep listening to the same whining. There 's not enough profit in running food processing plants/canneries in Canada. We buy foreign produce because Canadian farmers charge too much. Fact is a farmer receives a lower wholesale price for much of his fresh produce than 20 years ago, yet you pay more in the store. Either buy Canadian made and pay the price, or buy cheap offshore goods and pay the consequence. Don't wait too long. There might not be too many famers left in 5 years."

254304,carp-starter,2008-10-01 13:54:00,253,"Some of you guys are ""hard"" on China.  Some of you may remember Japan in the 50's. They sold mostly trinkets that was nothing but junk. But look at the Japanese products now.  If you can wait 50 years, who knows, China might be selling good stuff in the future. But we may not care if China ends up selling good products because by then we may end up being sick to the extreme or they may end up poisoning us with their poisoned food. This is scary because they keep putting in the wrong chemicals into food. Several weeks ago, it was found that they were puttingg in a certain chemical into food when that chemical is supposed to have gone into anti-freeze.  I suppose this could be a quiet way of winning a war against other nations - just export poisoned food.  carp-starter  --- good luck you guys - I think I will go and eats some sterilized pebbles."

I ended up buying a used one on ebay and it was in great shape.  Still use it all the time for fishing etc.  Joey"

In effect China as a whole is kind of the low cost producer of the entire world market in certain sectors.  More supply at a lower cost means that our wallets are heavier.  Everyone wants to go green and buy domestic products that are responsibily marketed.  Ya, that would be nice but are you prepared to pay?"

The Chinese made ones are strategically hidden behind the packaging.  Fooled me.  Just not the same having a Buck made in China.  Definitely won't be my favorite among my Schrade and Henkel, Leatherman and Buck Pocket knife."
