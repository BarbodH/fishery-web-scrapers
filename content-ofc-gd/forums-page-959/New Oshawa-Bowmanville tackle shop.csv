217869,vance,2008-06-21 18:32:00,719,Went to Hirks Marine and fishing tackle this morning for a look see.Its not a big store but the service is really good and they have a few different things and the owner is willing to get you what ever you want in 2-3 days if possible.Location of highway 2 and prestonvale road. Oh yeah never met the guy before and he doesn't know me I don't know him but he seems honest-I will probably go back!!!   vance
217894,Sinker,2008-06-21 20:22:00,8692,Hm....I'll have to stop in and check it out. I go by there all the time.  Thanks!!
217898,bbog,2008-06-21 20:28:00,665,I drove by there not more than an hour ago and didn't even notice.
217930,Black_Blade,2008-06-21 23:35:00,258,Cool...will have to check that out.  Now if only Le Baron's would open a store in Oshawa/Bowmanville!!
217935,carp-starter,2008-06-22 00:34:00,253, Black Blade - wouldn't you prefer a BPS instead of a LB in Oshawa/Bowmanville?  carp-starter
217936,jace,2008-06-22 00:43:00,472,"can't wait for Cabelas montreal to open..if that's still in their plans, i don't know."
217944,cpguy29,2008-06-22 01:53:00,148,"Bass Pro too expensive, I like Lebarons."
217964,mbac31,2008-06-22 05:04:00,904, That store was cancelled long ago. Bass Pro has now bought the site and opening a store in the fall ther. Cabelas has only taken over Sir out of Manitoba.

253849,Late Bloomer Fisherman,2008-09-30 01:54:00,3,Cannot picture the place. Does anybody have the address?
253867,Paulus,2008-09-30 02:31:00,522," Yeah it's not facing hwy2 so you don't see it unless you're really looking for it. If you know the plaza with Free Topping Pizza, it's on the west side. Just park at the plaza and go round the corner. You'll find it. Very nice guy runs it. Been there once and I was impressed with his willingness. Nice stuff too  p.-"
254507,Late Bloomer Fisherman,2008-10-02 02:05:00,3,"Stopped by on my way home from work today. Met Dave looked around and asked questions. Dave is very personable, helpful and seems to know his stuff. I will be going back and supporting local business in the near future."
254519,ozaibak1,2008-10-02 02:32:00,401,"I read a post before saying the Montreal Cabela's was cancelled, and they have plans to relocate it to Toronto... is this true!?!?"
