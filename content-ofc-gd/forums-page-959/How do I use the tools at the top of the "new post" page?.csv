(and I need things explained in a simple way  ) I'm trying to post my Alaskan report and was trying to figure out how to use the controls at the top of the new post page as I was trying to change the font size and underline certain things.  I can't do it.  I can't emphasize enough, if you can explain it, explain it as if you're talking to a 4 year old  .  Thanks guys!"
