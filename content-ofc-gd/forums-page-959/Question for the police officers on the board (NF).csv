254385,kemper,2008-10-01 19:11:00,2232,"  Exactly, what is more dangerous... someone doing 125 on the 401 or someone talking on the phone and trying to light a cigarette while attempting to keep it on the road at the same time.  TRAIN THE DRIVERS BETTER.  My lisence test was a joke, if you can keep the car between the lines you pass.  Oh ya, the woman who tested me was the wife of my driving instructor, great system.  I wonder why they advertise the highest pass rate..."
254392,BillM,2008-10-01 19:52:00,17367,"  Sure they can, and I'll feel bad for them and their family.  But will I feel bad for the idiot doing 50 OVER THE LIMIT who creams a deer on a dark sideroad?  Nope.  It sounds like you think people shouldn't take responsibility for their own actions..  Must be nice living in the world you do.  Time to wake up and smell the coffee.............bud.  BTW, there are speed limits in Germany, I am assuming you are talking about certain sections of the Autobahn."
254548,John Bacon,2008-10-02 04:10:00,3277,  Actually I do recall the Toronto Star publishing international rankings for accidents per kilometre of driving.  It showed Germany as having more accidents per kimometre than Canada.  This was back in mid nineties; the rankngs may have changed since then.
254575,fishing n autograph,2008-10-02 11:19:00,2540," Dude.....watch what you're saying....there are over 400 someodd laws in the Highway traffic act. It's hard for anyone who isn't enforcing it day in and day out to understand how several laws get misinterpreted because you don't use them everyday. The new stunt driving legislation has basically become a learn as you go thing because people who aren't fresh out of police college get a sheet of paper with the new act on it saying remember all of this......the criminal code is the same way...   anyway, our project ERASE team do an awesome job. The guys heading it up are former MTO safety inspectors and are doing their best. street racing is a plague....those who modify their cars to the point where they make themselves a heat score can deny being a part of it but you are. If you watch, you're just as likely to die as the guys doing it. I've seen it, and it's been in the papers. IF you don't believe me hang out at the following places in the city of Vaughan - 7 x woodstream, major mac x jane, keele x rutherford and anywhere on highway 7 from bayview to dufferin and you'll realize that not only do these guys race, a large majority of them are driving impaired by drugs. There is no excuse for adding illegal after market parts to your car to make it go faster and the fact of the matter is, those who do, don't understand that a honda civic can't be handled safely and isn't designed for 250hp....oh and by the way the cars that the modify basically disintegrate on impact...and civic hatch backs have a tendency to split in half on impact  oh and by the way, most tickets that are written are lost...not because the officers don't write the proper tickets, it's because the JPs can't interpret the HTA properly....and most side with the driver anyway  i'm done...night shift was long and people are frustrating lol"
254576,BillM,2008-10-02 11:35:00,17367,"Just a sec, people who modify their cars are all of a sudden street racers?  BTW, aftermarket parts are not ILLEGAL and I gotta say, from your post it's obvious you don't know much about cars/modifying a car at all.  You weren't the one writing those tickets were you?"
254592,ChrisK,2008-10-02 12:33:00,2772," I think what it he's trying to say Bill is that although you don't street race your modified car may become a target or afilliation of street racing in the eyes of the law. Looks like a skunk,smells like skunk......its a skunk...  Anyhow I think this NF thread has run its course and its time to put to rest.....night night"
254201,CLofchik,2008-10-01 02:45:00,854,"What everybody always seems to forget in discussions about this nifty new section to the HTA is that THERE ISN'T A SINGLE ITEM IN IT THAT WASN'T ALREADY COVERED BY EXISTING LAWS.  It's a frightening shortcut of the usual parliamentary system to fast track a provincial money making machine.  Global is running a series on 203 this week on the 6pm news, so far there's been 2900 cases that have gone through the system.  The conviction rates break down into 20/40/40.  40% convicted, 40% plead down to lower charges, 20% innocent.  The last one is what burns me the most.  You're looking at around $1200 for towing, impound and license reinstatement, that's BEFORE you ever get into a court room, and there's NO WAY to get any of that back if exonerated.  So far that's almost SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND raped from peoples pockets this year, just on the word of a cop at the side of the road.  If those levels stay the same for all 8500 charged so far we're looking at $2,000,000 for PEOPLE COMPLETELY INNOCENT OF THE CHARGE.  Then we come to those who were plead down, usually to 49km/h over.  This is where the ""transition zone"" comes in.  Where 100 or 80km/h limits drop and rise at the apparent drop of a random hat.  My personal favourite is the garbage truck caught ""racing"" at 102km/h in a 50 zone.  That the 200m long zone is in the middle of nowhere at the intersection of two dead straight barren roads doesn't matter.  Has there ever been an accident there....ever?  Probably not, but hey it's all in the name of ""safety"".  How would you like to be out of pocket for that tow bill?  Was the driver of the truck convicted?  Nope, plead down.   I don't think I've ever had a cop measure the tread depth on any of the cars I've been driving when I get pulled over, seen it three times so far this year on the bike.  It's a favourite of the cops along the Grand, Guelph, Waterloo/Kitchener & Brantford.  Those guys amp up the definition of ""fishing"".  And then there's the whole whack of other actions that can get you charged with ""stunting"", and these seem to hit bikers the hardest.  50 over is the one aspect that everybody focuses on, but there's a ton of other things that you can be burnt with, they are:  So if you're riding a bike for a few hours, your leg gets tired and you stand on the pegs to give them a stretch........oooops you're now a ""stunter"" because you've left the seat.  Sounds stupid right?  Well atleast one poor sod has been busted for that, by over zealous cops looking to use these new nifty powers at every opportunity they can.  And they are stretching those fuzzy definitions as far as they can.   Um....yeah......right Maybe a 100% increase on gas prices over two years might have something to do with less people driving less distance and crashing less?  96% of accidents happen at 20km/h over or less, that's the stat that Cam Wooley will NEVER give in a sound bite.  Because if 296 fatalities out of 300 don't have anything to do with speeding, golly gee our whole money making traffic enforcement system might be in jeopardy.  No more officers, no more planes, and alot less revenue.  Because traffic enforcement in this province, with it's artificially low limits (the lowest in North America), with the highest fines, is all about revenue generation and NOTHING to do with safety."
254271,hawkeye,2008-10-01 12:32:00,162,"I think that over half this horse hooey would stop if the speed limits were reasonable and enforced. Just about everyone knows you can get away with 120KPH on a 400 series highway so why not have the speed limit at 120 and enforce the damn thing.  And eliminate the speed trap variations, 80 drops to 60 and then back to 80 with no rhyme or reason except to fill some copâ€™s quota"
254275,tinbanger,2008-10-01 12:40:00,1028, again no reason to be 5o km over . I 'm surprised none of you complainers have argued how 'unfair' the construction zone speed limits are and that they are 'traps' to fill quotas.Same with school zones Oh and while your at it why should you bother slowing down and or changing lanes for stopped emergency vehicles.  Life is so unfair  TB
254290,BillM,2008-10-01 13:21:00,17367,"I think the 50+ fines are great, but saying someone is 'streetracing' while doing a buck 50 down the 400 is just stupid.  Another law put into place by people who couldn't define 'streetracing' to save their own life.  50 over anywhere is insane, especially on a backroad..  Good luck getting the car stopped when Mr.Buck decides to step out in front of you.  The good thing however is that you'll only end up killing yourself and not some other innocent person."
254336,steverowbotham,2008-10-01 16:02:00,1800," And the good thing about that, is that your family will not care either ...."
254337,danbo,2008-10-01 16:24:00,2646,SPEED KILLS.
254338,BillM,2008-10-01 16:25:00,17367,"Can't blame anyone other then the idiot behind the wheel.  If he didn't think of his family or perhaps what life would be like without him/her, I don't feel any pity at all."

254371,kemper,2008-10-01 18:40:00,2232,"I think the street racing law is great, if it was actually used to target STREET RACERS.  Which are a tiny small percentage of the deaths on the roads anyways...but that is a whole different story.  I was at a car club with a friend of mine one night, the club he belongs to is a very responsible one and their mantra is simple ""Keep it on the track"". This particular night a police officer shows up and claims he is from some ""street racing prevention division"" (whether this actually exists or not I am not sure) and starts searching/pulling cars apart looking for illegal parts and such. Fair enough, I suppose... except he keeps going back to this binder full of ""rules"" and attempting to change/fix laws in order to charge the owners of these vehicles. There was many tickets laid that night, some deserved but most NOT. Almost 100% of the tickets were shown innocent in the courts simply because this officer had so sickly twisted the definitions of  the laws. There was also the fact that when asking about cars the guy couldnt even properly identify the make, mazdas were GMs and Nissans were Fords. I guess it is hard to explain, but this officer really had NO CLUE what he was talking about that night, and i DO NOT BLAME HIM. If you are going to send officers out to bust potential street racers, at least train them properly.  It was a very bizarre situation, maybe one of the officers here can shed light on this ""street racing prevention division""?  the whole thing seemed kinda fishy to me."
254375,ozaibak1,2008-10-01 18:55:00,401,"Someone can get killed by 'Mr. Buck' doing the speed limit down the highway, they don't gotta be speeding. But using your logic at least they only kill themselves anyways and no one else cares right, maybe it happens to you!!! It makes me sick that you think its ok for someone to lose their life for speeding, and actually sorta sound happy about it."
254377,ozaibak1,2008-10-01 18:56:00,401,'Killing yourself' is a 'good thing.' You sound sorta sick bud.
254378,ozaibak1,2008-10-01 18:57:00,401,"Speed limit is only part of the equation, the other part is the ppl behind the wheel. Sadly in Canada our drivers for the most part suck and don't know how to drive.  One only needs to look at Germany, where there are NO SPEED LIMITS, and compare traffic deaths per capita to realize speed itself is only one factor and not the whole deal."
253959,Photoz,2008-09-30 15:03:00,792,"I sent this in 'TO THE EDITOR' of The Sun today, in response to a story on Page 10: 'RACERS SLOW TO LEARN.'   Dear Sir / Ma'am:  Although I believe it was necessary to do SOMETHING drastic to get the attention of these speedsters, I also believe there are likely more than just a few who are unfairly charged & given a 'roadside trial, conviction & sentence' without ever seeing a court of law? Actual 'STREET RACING' where actual high speed 'racing' is carried out on public roadways should result in a permanent seizure of vehicle & automatic lifetime ban on driving. Speeding only, on a wide open highway, in light traffic certainly SHOULD carry heavy penalties, but to me, this is NOT 'racing!' EVERY story I see, the information given out by police departments quote how many have been caught . . .     "". . .    as of last week 8459 drivers have been charged under the street racing law,"" I've never ONCE seen any figures of how many that were charged with 'street racing' were convicted under this law. There could easily have been THOUSANDS who were charged, had to pay out  a small fortune, then were found guilty of a much lesser offence? If the figures were released stating there was a 95% conviction rate, it would STILL mean over 400 drivers were unfairly charged & put through a pretty demeaning AND expensive experience, some maybe just on a cop's malicious whim? This is democracy?  Steve Herrell North York  Just my opinion . . .    what do you think?"
253961,Stoty,2008-09-30 15:08:00,2910,"I agree. Big different between ""racing"" and ""speeding"". To me, its just another Bull money making thing, and also another ""power tripping"" thing for the cocky cops.  My wifes friend got caught under this law......she was on a back country road at 11:30 at night (after working 16 hrs that day), with NO ONE else around.....yet she was ""street racing"".  I guess the cop thought she was racing her shadow..???"
253962,Stoty,2008-09-30 15:09:00,2910,"You cant say that someone doing 50+ on a back country road at night, with no one else around is the same as those BLOODY civic's (who think they are race cars), swerving in and out of traffic on the 401/400.  Give me a break!"
253965,POLLIWOGG,2008-09-30 15:16:00,835,"Get a motorcycle, they pull you over at any speed for that ""routine"" check."
