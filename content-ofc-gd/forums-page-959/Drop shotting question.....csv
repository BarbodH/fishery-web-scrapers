254444,Billy - Curtiss,2008-10-01 22:18:00,241,"Having never tried this technique before, I went out today and purchased all the needed accessories and finally figured out the way to set it up. My intent is to hit up some Toronto area spots from shore that I've never really worked before. My question is, has anyone ever hooked into rainbows, browns, walleye, salmon and or lakers using this technique? Is it even feasible?"
254449,timmeh,2008-10-01 22:36:00,609,"Well anything's feasible. It may not be a popular approach for those species but I've seen many fish caught on techniques that are uncommon to say the least. That being said I would be surprised if it works consistently (especially in clear water), but you never know. Make sure you use flurocarbon line for trout. I often try different things on very slow days."
254453,kemper,2008-10-01 22:47:00,2232,"It would not surprise me at all if it worked.  Browns are notorious for feeding near the bottom when they are in close, and they love minnows!  I drift minnows for browns in the fall near the bottom in slow moving current areas of the river mouth, I dont see why a dropshotted minnow imitation wouldnt work?"
254471,OhioFisherman,2008-10-01 23:36:00,6623,"Pretty common to get walleyes, steelhead, sheephead, here drop shotting. It`s a method to fool fish, any fish."
254486,wallyboss,2008-10-02 00:30:00,1095,"I use a dropshot setup, when I am icefishing for walleyes under a tipup then you can set the tipup to the very lightest setting and you will pickup any light bites."
254579,Billy Bob,2008-10-02 11:43:00,5865,"""Drop Shotting"" is nothing new except for it's name. Why a simple crappie rig is basically the same thing and they have been around forever.  Bob"
254584,ecmilley,2008-10-02 12:06:00,2163,"the system works great on walleye's can't see why trout and salmon wouldn't be all over it as well, I imagine it'll drive the browns crazy"
254587,Wild,2008-10-02 12:12:00,704, Bingo!
