253934,CLofchik,2008-09-30 13:14:00,854," Bronte, Credit & Humber all got ho's for a few years, all clipped, as an experimental stocking to judge returns.  Secretly I think they stopped because of the embarrassment to the Atlantic program and their dismal returns, very few coho's were stocked but if you were on the Ringwood egg collection last year you'd remember that the chinooks were almost outnumbered by the coho's at the dam!  Compare that with the ONE Atlantic captured.....even though there were twice as many stocked for that year class.  Here's all the stocking info for all the great lakes, great dbase.  http://www.glfc.org/fishstocking/index.htm"
254139,silvio,2008-10-01 00:04:00,433,"Thanks for the link. would love to see a stocking program in place for these fish. so does anyone have Facts on the few they stocked( return rate, how successful, reason for stopping stocking efforts)? any plans on staring a stocking program again?"

Hatchery technician Melanie Jepp scoops handful of Coho salmon fry at the Ringwood Fish Culture Station just north of Stouffville. Jepp says they respond best to AC/DC's music; Rush songs make them scatter.  Email story Print Choose text size Report typo or correction License this article  Salmon, trout that lure anglers to Ontario waters start their lives under den mother's care  Sep 30, 2008 04:30 AM Be the first to comment on this article... Jim Wilkes Staff Reporter  It sounds like a place where trout go to learn good manners.  But the Ringwood Fish Culture Station is where they and more than a million salmon get their start each year.  Nestled in the trees off Highway 48, just north of Stouffville, the station hums with the sounds of big fans and motors that keep water circulating in huge tanks, each containing thousands of sac-fry – the little fishies that have made the leap from roe to eager swimmers.  They'll keep growing until mid-November, when they'll be released in three streams leading to Lake Ontario. Most cozy in for a year before venturing out to the deep water of the lake, where they'll grow exponentially as long as they avoid thinking a lure is food.  Many will end up as some angler's dinner, but in the end, that's what it's all about.  ""Recreational fishing is huge for the economy, for conservation,"" said Lezlie Goodwin of the Anglers and Hunters Association. ""Anglers spend $2.5 billion in Ontario each year.""  And for Lake Ontario trophy catches, it all starts in a few sheds at Ringwood, where Melanie Jepp, a mother of four, also acts as den mother to 1.7 million little Coho, Chinook and Atlantic salmon, and rainbow and brown trout each year.  Jepp, 28, who studied fisheries and aquiculture at Texas A&M University and Sir Sandford Fleming College in Lindsay, works seven days a week at the Ringwood station, balancing a busy home life with her other family in the tanks.  ""I get to help the environment,"" she says.  ""It's cool. I get to make fish.""  The Ministry of Natural Resources opened the hatchery in 1982, but cost cutting forced them to mothball the station in 2006. The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters joined forces with the Toronto Sportsmen's Show to rescue the hatchery; each contributes $50,000 each year to keep it running.  Metro East Anglers is the host club and its members put in many volunteer hours, including stripping hundreds of thousands of eggs from spawning salmon each October along the Credit River in Mississauga.  Jepp oversees the growing process as the roe – and other eggs imported from far-flung parts of Ontario – develop into fry, then smolt before being released into the Credit, Duffins Creek in Whitby and Cobourg Brook, all of which empty into Lake Ontario.  ""The rainbow trout are my babies,"" she says. ""It's like sending your kids off to school. You're happy that you got them that far but sad that they're leaving.  ""But they're going to grow, go on to better things, explore and learn.""  And end up on somebody's plate.  ""I like these fish,"" Jepp adds. ""They taste good and they fight really well on the line.  ""But I like them as co-workers, too. They're really pretty, they're family fish. They like to touch each other when they swim.""  They like their music, too.  And like Donny and Marie used to say, they're a little bit country and little bit rock 'n' roll.  The Coho like to rock, but they're particular. ""They don't like Rush,"" says Jepp, ""it just makes them scatter. But they love AC/DC. The music makes them go faster and there's a pattern.""  Chinook find their pleasure elsewhere on the radio dial, favouring hurtin' songs.    The hatchery is open most days to visitors, but it's best to call ahead.

254207,CLofchik,2008-10-01 03:04:00,854," Returns are really hard to judge, but starting this year they have started stocking coho's again."
254244,jace,2008-10-01 09:42:00,472,"  I wouldn't mind seeing that as well.  I know people who run one of the most successful salmon hatcheries in the world as far as return rates and consistency and it takes a lot of work and dedication to make it happen.  It's a group of about 8-10 full time people, it runs around the clock, and everything they do is down to a science including feed times, food size, release times, disolved gas levels, etc  to keep them strong and disease free.    Marking can be done with fin clipping, but for the most part, when mass marking is required, hatcheries do it by timing patterns of water heaters which makes distinct otolith markings.   They're one of my favorite fish to catch because they put on a good show when they're on the line.  ...one of the nicer coho's caught this year.  around 35""  "
253373,silvio,2008-09-29 00:27:00,433,Spent the day with JDMLS and we had a riot lots of laughs. Managed a few boots but this one caught me off guard. On a side note seems like the main pushes are over with little spirits coming in now. We were fishing extremely close to the lake so there were know white tail half dead spotted salmon around. Also BBNOTTY has gone in for surgery on his back wish him good luck and hopefully a fast recover so we can start cranking steel. thank JDMLS for landing my fish pretty sure my heart stopped a few times lol. good times good laughs .  Just another fat hen   And the one that went nuts on me look at this ho... thing is so fresh. (ps the fish was caught in the pool below the rapids we just landed the fish there.) 
253378,jediangler,2008-09-29 00:47:00,1923,"Nice fish, Congrats.  Here's hoping a quick recovery for BBNOTTY"
253389,Guest chopchop,2008-09-29 01:06:00,0,Beauty fish...can't tell for sure but one reason she's so silver is because it looks like a Coho.
253393,bucktail,2008-09-29 01:09:00,1857,Nice fish....you sure thats not a jumbo coho???
253396,silvio,2008-09-29 01:13:00,433,Sorry for not being clear silver fish is a coho( i use the code name ho). Thanks these fish put up one hell of a fight.
253399,Guest chopchop,2008-09-29 01:19:00,0,They sure do fight like hell...both in the creeks and out on the lake. It's a shame they are not as prevalent as they used to be. Big numbers were great for offshore guys as well as the floaters on the creeks as Coho runs did not peak until after the chinny's were done...once again great fish!!
253429,camillj,2008-09-29 02:27:00,1988,Ah my favourite spot for late fall 'hos ... thanks for not photoshopping ... I would have thought it is still a bit early ... but ... obviously I was wrong .... nice job for sure and good to se they are still coming 'home' even though (I believe) the stocking of them has pretty much all but stopped in that trib.

253449,steverowbotham,2008-09-29 03:11:00,1800,"Just seeing that spot gives me the ""willies"""
253452,silvio,2008-09-29 03:21:00,433,Fish had no fin clips so it wasnt a stocked fish. I didnt see many flashes in the pool so i dont think there were many.
253453,chickenhawk,2008-09-29 03:24:00,612,o man......so jealous have no idea
253455,sharper,2008-09-29 03:42:00,279,Great pics! That coho looks beautiful!
253467,CLofchik,2008-09-29 09:11:00,854," The Yanks don't fin clip their ho's, and I don't think they were EVER stocked in that trib.  Strays just colonized it very nicely."
253488,ccmtcanada,2008-09-29 11:28:00,7971,Awesome stuff!!!  How'd the wrist hold up to those battles?  Great to see a report from you again Silvio...  All the best to bbnotty too!
253504,silvio,2008-09-29 12:11:00,433,Cliff the wrist held up fine lol the screw does its job. Thanks everyone fish was a beauty still cant forget the fight or how chrome it was.
253585,kemper,2008-09-29 16:07:00,2232,"ah yes, the chrome coho.  Thats a beauty man, I have been lucky enough to tangle with three this season.  and they all kicked my ars.  Ill land one, someday"
253626,jdmls,2008-09-29 17:25:00,575,"Ya that was a sweet Ho !!! Good times, man ...can't wait for the steel..Those boots beat up enough of my gear this season already...Oh ya and every time I have been down there this year , Me and the guys I went down with were the only legit fisherman down there, surrounded by immigrants with baseball bats and downrigger nets...So If you don't know of this spot already than clearly you have to get out more !!  LET THE BOOTS LIVE ANOTHER DAY...OR TWO  , LOL !!!"
253630,Leecher,2008-09-29 17:28:00,7832,Nice looking ho    Congrats Thanks for sharing Leechman
253633,fishnsled,2008-09-29 17:30:00,3520,"First - All the best for a speedy recovery BBNOTTY!!  Second - A couple of nice fish there, thanks for the report."
253738,silvio,2008-09-29 22:17:00,433,Anyone have the stocking info for coho salmon for ontario.
253739,kemper,2008-09-29 22:24:00,2232,"  Ya, NOT ENOUGH   if any...?"
253749,silvio,2008-09-29 22:49:00,433,Lol kemper I think the credit river stocks but would love to see stats these are amazing fish.
253752,kemper,2008-09-29 22:57:00,2232,"They sure are, I beat my equiptment up every year sorting through the boots to get to them.  I put them on the same level as steelies, except far more rare where I fish!"
253753,silvio,2008-09-29 23:01:00,433,pound for pound yea but coho are alot bigger making it seem like they fight better
253817,John Bacon,2008-09-30 00:49:00,3277," The fall of 2007 would have been the last run from MNR stocked fish.  Metro East Anglers did collect eggs from the 2007 run for stocking, so hopefully we can get some better runs in the future.  We do hope to collect eggs this year as well.  The lack of a fin clipping does not indicate that it is not a stocked fish.  2008 is the first year that all stocked fish are being fin clipped.  I am not aware of any coho's being clipped in previous years.  In past years, the Chinooks involved in pen rearing projects were clipped.  However, the majority or Chinooks stocked in previous years were unclipped.  Your fish may have been been a stray from the U.S. (who still stock cohos), an Ontario stocked fish that spent an extra year in the lake, or a naturally reproduced fish.  I believe that all Ontario stocking was in the Credit; however, I am not sure about that."
