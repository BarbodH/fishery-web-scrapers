Most of the changes go toward function and add some handy admin features as well. We will discuss over time which of the features will get added (some of them are either not relevant or just not worthwhile). If you have an appreciation for software you can watch the company owner and head developers blog here.. http://forums.invisionpower.com/blog/ips_news/index.php?
