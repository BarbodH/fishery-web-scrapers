253957,Photoz,2008-09-30 14:44:00,792,"Lets cut the indignant / wronged act . . . .    here ya were, quick to brag about owning 2 Shimano Stellas, worth, taxes in, about $1000.00 each, plus you've openly posted more than once, varios values of match & carp gear. I think if you go back over your posts, last spring you gave a figure of having $15,000.00 of carp gear imported from England & Europe when I was birchin' about not being able to get a part for my Fox buzzer! If ya can't take a little ribbin,' then don't post stuff like that to begin with! BTW . . ..     I NEVER was able to locate that part either!"
253987,kingofthesteelhead,2008-09-30 16:43:00,140,"Daiwa. Ihave one older Regal series. 4 of the SS 1500 Tournament series ,one Exceler and one of the new Team Daiwa Advantage. From everything to walleye,perch crappie,bass and steelhead. None of these reels were overly expensive. The best selection is at Bass Pro Shops!"
253990,jdmls,2008-09-30 16:53:00,575,  PFLUEGER PRESIDENT....BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK AMD MAYBE MORE $$$ .... I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DON'T CHARGE MORE FOR A REEL THAT OUTPERFORMS OTHER REALS IN ITS PRICE RANGE BY FAR
253991,Dabluz,2008-09-30 16:55:00,701,"My Symetre 2000 with rear drag has had a lot of hard use in the past (I think 8 to 10 years) and it is still working like it was brand new.  With the anti-reverse off, I can place the handle of the reel in a horizontal position and the reel will slowly rotate until the handle is pointing down.  No loose parts, has never been opened for cleaning and lubrication and I use it year round.  I use 2 lb test mono for brook trout on this reel and have never had a brookie break the line.  2 to 4 lb brookies are quite common up here where I live.  I also use this reel for walleye using 4 and 6 lb test mono.  Even though the reel has a rear drag, it is very smooth.  However, I always transport my rods in a rod case and my reels in a cloth bag.  I even use the reel in brackish water for migratory brook trout in the Saguenay river.  If you search the internet, you will see that the Symetre is considered the best ""bang for the buck""."
253998,legacey,2008-09-30 17:12:00,127,"I just got 2 Shimano Stradic 2500's and matching Compre rods thru a prize pack from Shimano and WFN.  I've only used these a few times but love them.  I had a Quantum PT reel but within less than a year, the gears completely seized while fighting a huge small mouth this summer  Here's a link to a test between Diawa and Shimano...hope it helps.  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewshootoutcapstrad.html  Cheers and good luck with your decision.  Legacey"
253999,solopaddler,2008-09-30 17:12:00,8605,"I ran a Stradic MGFb in Alaska last week when throwing hardware and it performed flawlessly. Super smooth and an excellent drag, definitely as good as the higher end Daiwas I fish with. I'll be grabbing another one over the winter..."
254002,MJL,2008-09-30 17:16:00,2427,"$15,000....That's a lot of Delkims and custom Harrison carp rods  Been using my Stradics for about 8 yrs.  Never had a complaint with any of them.  Performed beautifully and when they eventually die I'll replace them with the newer model.  Never heard a bad thing about them.  My dad's a Daiwa fan.  I played around with his Daiwa Advantage (It's black and gold) and it also felt great."
254043,bassjnkie,2008-09-30 19:36:00,1101,"Thanks for the suggestions.  Dear Photoz, I understand you are getting to an age, where you have nothing better to do than complain. I am half you age, I have more assets than you will have when you die. I have something to show in life, and you have Jealousy. You really better say off the back, or I will make a complete fool out of you. Every value is true, oh ya plus my brand new boat, look up the boat cover post so you can see it's, if you think I'm lieing. You are a waste of breath, with nothing better to do with you life. Like I said, your F$%&^ing with the wrong person. GO GET A BLOODY LIFE!!!    MJL and eveyone else, the value that was said is correct. I will explain PHOTOZ value, I don't like to be called a liar. I don't have very expensive Euro carp gear in Canada, the match stuff is high up there. I have a Tracker V-16 DLX side console with a 50 4 stoke. I am a crazy collector, I do have the 2 Stellas mentiond, I have many special issue reels, I have collected all the Cargem collection from the Sea 66 to the little Mingon, I have a few Green abu zebcos, I have very rare reels here and in Italy. The value of $25,000 that was said is actually more, considering all the carp/Match equipment I have collected in Italy, ever seen Fish O Mania, exactly like that.  I really hope this clears thing up, and I hope you can understand I was not shooting my mouth.  Daniel"
254046,MJL,2008-09-30 19:51:00,2427," Never doubted the value of your gear.  Already knew you had a boat...Just a little friendly ribbing on my part.  Looking at my own inventory, I don't have a boat but I do have a vice for high-end carp and steelhead gear  Who ever said fishing was cheap was a liar."
254054,bassjnkie,2008-09-30 20:15:00,1101," I know your stuff Mike. Can I say it, Tackle Tart"
254064,maybo,2008-09-30 20:34:00,86,"Hi Daniel, if you haven't tried the Shimano Stradic, I really recommended you give it a try. That is one reel I never get tired of. I have both 2500FH and 3000FI, and I have a friend use his 4000FH for salkt water fishing. very duable, great reel."

254094,bassjnkie,2008-09-30 21:31:00,1101,"  Canadian Carper? What? Never had that screen name. Problem? People that don't stay out of others affairs. I'm done with you, and I will stop posting on this thread, as 15+ ofners PM me to tell me I am wasting my time even posting. People know what you are about.  Canadian Carper?"
254098,Roy,2008-09-30 21:37:00,13728,Some good suggestions for some decent reels here. I like Stradics myself.  Let's back this one into the garage Gracie.....with civility.
253270,bassjnkie,2008-09-28 19:52:00,1101,"I like my Daiwa reels, but I am willing to buy something else. I need at least 200yrds of 10lb mono, a good front drag (very important), and a solid body/frame. Price range I am not sure of, but please suggest something reasonable.  I am not a Shimano guy, but I know there are a lot of Shimano lovers out there, so suggest away.  These are some reels I was looking at online.  1 - Daiwa® Exceler 3000  2 - Pflueger® President 6740X  3 - Pflueger® Supreme XT  9040XT  4 - Pflueger® Supreme 8040MGX  Thanks in advance for the suggestions  Daniel"
253272,Radnine,2008-09-28 19:55:00,1538,I have three Excelers (1500 and two 2500) and love them. I have found them the cheapest at LeBaron (at regular price that is). Jim
253273,Greencoachdog,2008-09-28 19:57:00,8163,I love my Stradics... very dependable!!!
253274,bigugli,2008-09-28 19:58:00,6138,I'm on my 3rd year with a Pfleuger President and it has been quite reliable considering the abuse a lot of my gear goes through.
253275,Hellfish,2008-09-28 20:00:00,308,"I have 2 quantum pts energy and absolutly love them, a little heavy but certainly a great build."
253277,PatrickGG,2008-09-28 20:05:00,562,I like my Stradic and my Sahara's the Saros don't look to bad either.
253289,Burtess,2008-09-28 20:46:00,901," Why look anywhere else then????  If you can't already tell I am a pure Daiwa guy....  Of the Daiwa's I own the Team Daiwa Advantage 2500 size is one fine reel.  I don't think they make them anymore (discontinued last year?) but if I were to buy one now I would opt for the Team Daiwa® TD-Pro, Daiwa® Tierra™, or the Daiwa® Sol™.  A little bit more $ than the Exceler but nice reels for sure.  And as Radnine posted, LeBaron usually has much better pricing on the Daiwa stuff....  Burt"
253291,danbo,2008-09-28 20:48:00,2646,Why mess with perfection?  -Daiwa-
253293,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-28 20:50:00,241,The Pflueger President is quite possibly the best bang for your buck. I went into Bass Pro intent on purchasing a Quantum Energy PTI and the salesman told me I would be wasting the extra money. He then made me try out both reels and the Pflueger was actually quite a bit smoother. And for about $70.00 less. I spent the savings on tackle!
253295,Canuck2fan,2008-09-28 20:52:00,1444,"I have to go +1 on the Pflueger President 6740's I have bashed the heck out of my two and they just keep on working. I fish all winter long for steelhead with mine, and use to fish all summer. They seem to take -30C or +30C equally well. I found shimanos at the cooler temps felt like I was turning a coffee grinder..."

253312,bassjnkie,2008-09-28 21:40:00,1101,"You got me, I do have 2 stellas 2500 but I need a little more line, like a 3000, but I want a reel that I can punish a bit. Thanks everyone, I wanted to try different company like Pfluger. I did come to a decision though, yes Shimano, either the Shimano Stradic FI, Shimano Stradic MgFB, or even the Shimano Saros F, please give me some feedback on these reel if you use them, GCD I got your vote!!  Photoz, how do you know what my carp and match gear is worth."
253319,danbo,2008-09-28 22:18:00,2646,I think ya should get a new guitar instead..
253324,Wild,2008-09-28 22:26:00,704,"I don't know where y'all are getting these fancy names from but I say go with the Mitchell 300 it has the capacity you need, good front drag and is pretty sturdy."

253397,Laker272,2008-09-29 01:13:00,45,"I agree with prior posts the Pflueger reels and rods are amazing for the money. I have the a couple sizes of the President, and a couple Trions all very good. I also like my Shimano Sahara. Very smooth and resonable in price."
253401,Victor,2008-09-29 01:27:00,1609,"i've got a sedona, a sahara, a symmetre, and a saros ... and i love them all lol."
253402,silvio,2008-09-29 01:35:00,433,Sorry I didnt bother reading the other post so forgive me if it has been mentioned. for the money diawa regal is a great reel. Smooth drag has stoped its fair share of salmon.
253770,bassjnkie,2008-09-29 23:39:00,1101," I remeber everything I say. Remeber this one, just to clear things up, I under estimated the value of my equipment, it is alot more. Oh ya, can you please keep things to yourself, I really don't think everyone on this board should know the value of my stuff. I have to give you this, you have alot of nerve posting this. Nothing better to do EH!   Victor how do you like the saros?"
253772,Raf,2008-09-29 23:44:00,3495,now i know how the ex found out about the subscribtion to boobs'n'tubes.
253784,Victor,2008-09-30 00:10:00,1609, Have yet to land anything big on it (only 1-2lb bass) yet but it's smooth. When i played around with it in Lebarons it was actually smoother than the stradic (and quite a few people say that too). For the price it's definitely a great reel.
253786,ctdd2006,2008-09-30 00:11:00,531,"for the money I spent I'm quite satisfied with both my Spirex and Sedona.  They've been durable but my Spirex took a bit of a beating recently running into a few 25+"" pike while throwing jigs for walleye to the point where my drag isn't working the way it once did and I'm going to replace it."
253793,bassjnkie,2008-09-30 00:20:00,1101," Thanks for the info. Has a strong/smooth drag thats what I looking for. I was going to ask if it's solid, but I will find out tommorrow at LeBaron.    I had a couple of Sedona's their great, I will look into the Spirex.  Thanks"
253795,bassjnkie,2008-09-30 00:24:00,1101,MODS please remove PHOTOZ post with the value of my equipment. I don't think it is fair to me to have it shown for all to see.
253832,Mike the Pike,2008-09-30 01:22:00,3421, I am with the Dog on this one .I love my Shimano 4000 Stradic all time favorite reel. never had to repair a Shimano. Quantum I have had a couple of them jam up.
