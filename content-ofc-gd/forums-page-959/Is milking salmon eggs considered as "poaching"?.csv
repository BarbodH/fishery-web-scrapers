254722,tdotfisherman,2008-10-02 16:46:00,317,I am in amazement about how most of the threads posted this late summer/early fall on this forum in regards to salmon have gone south so quickly.. Many of the posters here have absolutely blown me away.. I thought anglers were suposed to be calm and wise.. I guess that's not the case for all..
254724,jdmls,2008-10-02 16:53:00,575,"LOL this guy is the only guy I know that can get 30 replies to his post in  2 hours....

Pointing to the ""Ask a CO"" site and other such sources will generate a far more desirable outcome. Sometimes, the newbie you rag on is just some 13-14 year old kid looking for answers. Unlike many of us, they weren't raised from the cradle with 'silver hooks and fishing line', and don't have somebody at home to teach them about the outdoors. Or they come from a part of the world where sport fishing is unknown.  As experienced and skilled anglers we should provide sound advice on the forum rather than treat someone asking questions like a useless teat."

254746,fishnpro,2008-10-02 18:39:00,93,I think all salmon posts should be banned for the remainder of the season. Ever f-ing week its the same crap about salmon and snagging and poaching and im getting tiered of reading this crap every day. Can someone please do something!
254747,Raf,2008-10-02 18:47:00,3495,fairly certain you can just not click the post.  there's also the handy-dandy ignore list feature!

And in conclusion I leave you with advice to go forth with---Don't sweat the petty stuff and don't pet the sweaty stuff.  AAAH I'm just goofin around that's all.....

254635,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-10-02 14:27:00,0,"Alright, here is the story.  One guy in the same pool I was fishing at caught a nice female full of loose eggs. He quickly took off the hook from the mouth and said  ""Oh yes, I finally get to have some salmon eggs for this steelhead season"" ""This is my first female salmon with loose eggs this year!"" ""Cool, nice fight, man"" I said  He then filled up the small re-sealable half-coke-can-size container before reviving/releasing it back into the water.  Suddenly, an old guy across the pool yelled ""It is poaching! You can not abandon the fish after taking eggs!""  ""No, it is not. First of all, I DID NOT kill the fish to take eggs"" ""Secondly, I only took a small cup and let the fish continue its journey"" he replied.  I read the regulations over and over again but still could not figure out whether it should be considered as poaching or not .. what do you guys think?"
254640,Roy,2008-10-02 14:33:00,13728, I think you're trolling....again.
254641,danbo,2008-10-02 14:34:00,2646,"The fish will die from the handling, but it isn't poaching. Legally he should have kept her."

254662,solopaddler,2008-10-02 15:02:00,8605,It's not considered poaching nor is it illegal. The eggs count as 1 fish towards your daily limit though. At least that's how it was explained to me.
254664,danbo,2008-10-02 15:05:00,2646,You got your answer already smart -
254667,carp-starter,2008-10-02 15:12:00,253,"No it is not poaching. If the guy has a fishing licence, he can keep at least 2 trout per day.  carp-starter  FROM ""ASK CO""  Question 125:  Regarding the collection of trout/salmon roe for personal use as bait. Is it legal to partially ""strip"" a female salmon or trout of roe then return the fish to the river, providing the fish has been caught legally? It seems that this activity would fall under molesting or harrassing the fish but the alternative, killing the fish for the eggs, seems even worse.  Asked June 28/00  Answer from the MNR  There is nothing in the Fisheries Act or the Ontario Fishery Regulations which prohibits this particular activity. Personally, if I was taken out of my natural elements and stripped of my eggs, chances are I would consider myself molested!! On the other hand, there is no provision in the law with regard to molesting or harassing fish. However, you should be aware that chances are that such a fish, after the handling is likely going to die anyway.  That being said, eggs, by definition, are fish. While we have never limited the number of roe sacs which one may possess from legally taken fish, when you handle the fish as you have indicated that fish is deemed to be 'captured and retained'. Therefore each fish that you perform this activity upon would be considered part of your daily limit."
254670,dp3200,2008-10-02 15:18:00,31,"The fish is going to die anyway, so he would be just as well to have kept her and taken all of the eggs... he basically killed the fish for 1/4 of her eggs, so overall he will probably kill 4 times the number of fish that anyone else would for the same number of eggs.  ...I'm not even going to start on the fact that he is wasting the salmon eggs if he is going to use them for steelhead....you can get 'em with salmon roe, but there are lots of better things he can be using."
254673,wallyboss,2008-10-02 15:20:00,1095,Just e-mail MNR and they will let you know.  [emailÂ protected]
254677,anders,2008-10-02 15:24:00,1168,"There you have your answers, for the upteenth time.  Drop the subject about keeping salmon, comparing salmon, and colours of salmon.  Its get tiring of seeing the same S***, just different day from you."
254678,danbo,2008-10-02 15:32:00,2646,This thread should be closed before we lynch the guy!
254682,Billy Bob,2008-10-02 15:44:00,5865,"Easy on this guy. Just because he a so called newbie doesn't warrant the disrespect some have show here. It's this what this forum is for. I see MANY non fishing post and those posters have never been scolded like this. Simply put, if you don't like the post don't respond. I have had to take that approach MANY times.  Now reading that the MNR officer said that he would consider himself molested but nothing is illegal about stripping the eggs and now the fish will die.  Isn't this EXACTLY what takes place for stocking programs all around the world. Fish of all species are caught to have their eggs stripped and let loose to live again. Of course pacific salmon do not survive their spawning ritual."
254684,cplummer,2008-10-02 15:52:00,165,He did the correct thing.. at least the fish can finish her life cycle by reviving her!!! a small amount of eggs (if needed) are fine.. by no means was he poaching..
254686,danbo,2008-10-02 15:54:00,2646,nice sig..xxxxxl
254696,cplummer,2008-10-02 16:09:00,165,thanks   it was made for the blind
254698,BillM,2008-10-02 16:13:00,17367,"Just a sec, the fish is going to die in about 2 weeks anyhow correct?  I don't see the big deal, personally I would have taken all the eggs because she will most likely not be able to deposit the remaining."

254712,BillM,2008-10-02 16:35:00,17367,"  So respect would have been to chop her up and put her in the deep fryer?  Instead she *might* lay those remaining eggs, who knows."
254715,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-10-02 16:41:00,0,"Alright, thanks for the answers guys.  It is technically not poaching but rather a bit of bad practice.  From now on, if anyone asks me about this on the river, I will tell him/her that if he/she eventually needs a fish worth of eggs, then he/she might as well just take one complete fish home instead of milking small amount from each fish.  Once again, thanks for supportive posts and other negative comments are welcome as usual since I dont judge people rather try to learn and to think from their perspectives.  Cheers,"
254716,Guest gbfisher,2008-10-02 16:41:00,0,I don't understand your infatuation with targeting a fish at the end of its life cycle or that is not  edible. Why not target something that takes SKILL ? I can see harvesting for eggs ...but after 5 fish. Yer done for years!!! Not to mention that there are other ways to catch trout.   but....that'd put skill into the equation again.
