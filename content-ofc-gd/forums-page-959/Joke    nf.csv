A sister and brother are talking to each other when the little boy gets up and walks over to his Grandpa and says, ""Grandpa, please make a frog noise.""  The Grandpa says, ""No.""  The little boy goes on, ""Please...please make a frog noise.""  The Grandpa says, ""No, now go play.""  The little boy then says to his sister, ""Go tell Grandpa to make a frog noise.""  So the little girl goes to her Grandpa and says, ""Please make a frog noise.""  The Grandpa says, ""I just told your brother 'no' and I'm telling you 'no'.""  The little girl says, ""Please...please Grandpa make a frog noise.""  The Grandpa says, ""Why do you want me to make a frog noise?""  The little girl replied, ""Because mommy said when you croak we can go to Disney World!"""
