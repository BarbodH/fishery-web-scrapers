253977,Roy,2008-09-30 16:23:00,13728,I think most dealers will take a trade in.
253980,idesign,2008-09-30 16:27:00,149," If you have time,can you list some dealers contact info.thank you"
254009,huntervasili,2008-09-30 17:42:00,1604,I am sure a google search or yellowpages.ca search will be you're best bet. Lots of dealers it mainly depends on you're area
254091,HTHM,2008-09-30 21:28:00,4082,"It may not be an engine issue, but rather a prop issue. Talk to J & J marine in Hagersville for some good advice."
254096,canadianboy,2008-09-30 21:32:00,83,i know some people with similar boats if its an open bow depending on length im presuming 18 feet probably 2500 pounds that should be going at least 35 if not 40 i would get the engine inspected and would look into a new prop as you might have it chipped that could meen you are losing alot of tourque. check the psi on the cylinders and check that the throtle linkage is ok and thats its not extremely tight and you just cant push the control alll the way. if theres nothing wrong its seriously not worth selling your old motor through a dealer get someone who knows boats and will do it cheap to take it out then you can sell that on the board or kijiji for a lot more than a dealer would give. with regardes to a new motor dont buy new way to expensive and it wont be worth it for resale just look on auto trader i often see plenty of 4.3 for around 2500
254111,idesign,2008-09-30 22:22:00,149," thx for suggestion.It is exact boat as this guy selling on kijiji Doral Spirit4Sale  So u think i should be getting more mph.Boat is 17.5""  let me know.thx"
254120,canadianboy,2008-09-30 22:54:00,83,i would think you should be able to hit at least 35 is this readings from the spedometor or gps
254128,idesign,2008-09-30 23:28:00,149, it is from Lowrance GPS i have 2 of them.both has similar reading
254148,canadianboy,2008-10-01 00:24:00,83,hmm i would get a mechanic to have a look
254278,Greencoachdog,2008-10-01 12:50:00,8163,If you want a boat that will go more faster... check out one of these! http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseacti...ideoid=15284565
