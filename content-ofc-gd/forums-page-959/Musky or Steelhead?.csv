254751,hammercarp,2008-10-02 19:17:00,964,Aurora Trout over poached Sandhill Crane eggs. Hmmm
254755,bukee,2008-10-02 19:19:00,58,"I find that muskie only taste good if they are over 50"".   Stuff a trophy muskie with fingerling trout that yet can net at a release site and eat away.....hahaha."
254756,kemper,2008-10-02 19:21:00,2232,"That depends, is the musky wrapped in bacon?  And is the trout stocked or wild?  Did the baby trout hatch?  Was the trout previously milked of her eggs?   Can I trade my musky for old boot salmon?"
254763,chickenhawk,2008-10-02 19:53:00,612,mmmm them boots taste good smoked with some cajun in em.....ahaha   Hawk
