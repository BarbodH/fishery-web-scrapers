Had a great time and managed too pull in some specks in between the chubs, with a couple small rainbows and a brown to round things out. All fish were caught on barbless hooks  (this really makes releasing fish much easier) and I release 100% of the trout I catch. Here are a few pics...    This fish was very acrobatic in his attempt to escape           Before heading home I decided to do a little bassin. When I found this fish they were certainly feeding, even the WGSF were putting on weight. Here are some of the bigger bass...    This picture doesn't do this fish justice, it was a nice river fish, but it's hard taking pics by yourself.   Chunky little WGSF. For reference that's a 4"" tube in his mouth. "

Nice fish man, tomorrow is the last day to get out and lay a slaying on the brookies  (I doubt I'll even be able to make it, have some car problems that need to be fixed)"
