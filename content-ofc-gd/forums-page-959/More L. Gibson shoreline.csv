Just some large pannies.      Out again with my friend, Dave,  doing the chauffeur duties. Again, tough time locating the bite. Found schools of minnows at a discharge pipe and watched the bigger fish busting the surface chasing them.  Once we trapped a few minnows it was game on. No monsters, but lots of action just the same.   "

254624,johnnyb,2008-10-02 13:58:00,3413,I like the scars on that first WGSF....are there pike in there too?
254719,bigugli,2008-10-02 16:43:00,6138,Yes there are.
254817,rockfish,2008-10-02 22:33:00,91,It was a fun day out Bruce and a pretty good day for a day off until we dodged a few downpours in the late afternoon.   The fish were definately on a minnow bite and were ignoring all our lures except for one of your tubes. That one Rockie u caught the day before was lucky to have survived that toothy critter attack.  
254825,bigugli,2008-10-02 22:55:00,6138, If'n the minners weren't working I was gonna have to pull out the spare 'red stick' I keep in my back pack. A sure fire cure for even the worst case of lock jaw
