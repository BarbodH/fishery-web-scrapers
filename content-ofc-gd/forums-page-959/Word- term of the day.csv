254856,Greencoachdog,2008-10-03 00:27:00,8163,Maybe that's what greenwashing is up yonder... but down here it's what you do to Collards after you pick them and before you cook them!
254879,bigugli,2008-10-03 01:25:00,6138,"Up here we do the same to turnip greens, or as you might call them, rutebagers?"
254889,Greencoachdog,2008-10-03 01:45:00,8163," Nope! They're Turnip greens down here too, the only part that's really worth eating... tried feeding the bottom part to the dog and she wouldn't even eat them!!!  Not sure that Rutabaga's are even fit for hog slop."
