253462,Badger Shark,2008-09-29 07:38:00,291,"Its been a long time coming but this Sat. we ventured out and found the Pigs!  Went out yesterday with Eric (Clown Worship). We met up with Terry and Andy and their buddies and headed out around 7ish am. We all split off in different directions to cover water. The water we were fishing is a large area to search.  Eric and I started trolling and trolling and trolling, finally Eric get a fish on. It is fighting hard and I say "" I think its a sheepie"" and I was right. But hey its a fish!  Here is a pic   At around 12:30 Eye Tracker called me and we headed in to pick him up. As soon as he boarded he pointed us in the direction that would prove to be Hog Land.  We set up a six board spread and covered alot of water before the first pig struck. I am up first, I could tell she was an eye. Finally we get her on board and I have my first Hog of the this fall season and we have found the big girls!  Here is the pic   Within five minutes after putting her back Eric is onto a fish. He gets her in and has his first of the season.    After another 10 min or so Sheldon gets a nice one on but unfortunately she T-boned the lure and at about 50 feet from the boat it just opened her mouth and let go. It was weird becaue we could see the lure sideways in its mouth , also all but one of the fish headed to the surface right away which is why we lost 4. It is really important to keep them below so they have a harder time shaking the hook loose.  After a while my rod goes off again and I am fighting another nice eye, after a nice net job I have my second of the day.    A while after this one Eric gets another one on.   Then there was a bit of a lull and finally Sheldon gets another one on, unfortunately this one did the same as the last one at almost the same point. Man Eric and I felt bad for him.  My next fish was a bit of a surprise, we werent sure exactly what it was. This fish was jumping all over the place. Finally we get her in and she is my biggest smallie of the year. What a football!    Pics dont do it justice. Close to 5lbs I am sure!  It is starting to get late and Sheldon still hasnt got one in. He says looks like the bite has stopped. I said we we had a lull before so why dont we try a bit longer. Good thing we did as he finally pulled in the Hog of the day. This fish fought him the whole way and bulldogged to the bottom at least 6 or 7 times. It took a while but finally she is in the boat and Sheldon is all smiles with this 10lb3oz long Pig!.    It was a priveledge and a pleasure to have Sheldon out on my boat with no preassure to produce fish for clients and to actually be able to enjoy himself fishing and to be able to just goof around. We both really enjoyed your company Sheldon and cant wait to get out with you again.  And I havent forgot about the birthday offer of a net!  Cant wait to get out next weekend.  IT HAS BEGUN BABY!!!!!!!!!"

253647,Badger Shark,2008-09-29 17:57:00,291,"Leechman, that smallie was airborn at least 5 times.  At first we didnt know what it was.  I am not a bass guy but it was a blast reeling that in.  It took a while to find the big eyes and a pattern to find out what they wanted but when we did it was worth the time.  Cant wait for the next outing!"
