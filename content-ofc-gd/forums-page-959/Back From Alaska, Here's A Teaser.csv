253984,kemper,2008-09-30 16:39:00,2232,"jdmls,  some bugger pulled out my favourite fish holding shopping cart!  can usually find 2 or 3 nice steelies sitting in behind there, feeding on the rice grains that are falling out of the no frills bag just upstream.  I think they bite easily because they are a little drunk from those empty beer cans that are stuck under the rusty car hood.   Oh what I would give to fish in alaska, Solo I bet you didnt see one shopping cart the whole time!"
