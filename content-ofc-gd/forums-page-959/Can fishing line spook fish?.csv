254456,forrest,2008-10-01 22:51:00,1032,"the tests....  Well...one flouro line rated at a higher knot strength than mono.  But, they only tested one knot...the palomar....and did not say what diameter the knot hole was.  No stretch is about the only thing that is a common myth....but that is a good thing.  People buy braid for no stretch...no secret, flouro for something else.....a stretch in a leader is good IMO.  Not sure what the abrasion test was about:  they had dry and wet abrasion tests for the mono baseline test but only dry for the flouro? (I am not catching too many fish on rocky above water cliffs)  Why is this important?  Because the mono did a lot poorer when wet, so how did the fluoro do?   The tackle tour tests were not in any way of a scientific nature...more of a magazine nature.  forrest"
254492,kemper,2008-10-02 01:05:00,2232,"I have gone to a flouro lead for steelheading, 5 lb.  I find it totally depends on the maker of the line and not realy about flouro/mono etc. I also use a mono lead sometimes and I dont find it really affects the number of fish I catch. For example when its cold enough that there is ice at the sides of the river I actually switch my lead to a 4 or 6 lb trilene XT. I find that I lose too many fish when the light flouro gets clipped by the ice, but 6 lb XT can slide over just about anything and not break."
254502,Dabluz,2008-10-02 02:00:00,701," Did you see the second article about the second battery of tests?  Other knots were tried out.  The diameter of the knot hole was the same for the mono.  It was a test between fluorocarbon and mono.  Most people have been buying fluorocarbon because the common myth was that fluorocarbon did not stretch as much as mono and thereby better hook sets.  The testing was a comparison between Trilene XL against a bunch of fluorocarbon lines.  Trilene XL is a mono with about the most amount of line stretch when compared to other mono lines.  No need to test fluorocarbon when wet....it does not absorb water even when soaked for 3 hours.  So the 3 hour soaking was eliminated in order to make the testing a bit faster.  The testing was scientific enough to my tastes.  What more should have been done?  The tests were done to debunk all of the suposed advantages that fluorocarbon lines have over mono.  There are no advantages to using fluorocarbon instead of mono.  Actually, with mono, you have more advantages such as stronger knots, no stiffness, no line damage after the line is stressed, better resistance to shock, just as good resistance to abrasion if not better, better over all strength.  So, if a fisherman decides that if fluorocarbon is invisible in water (not been proven yet) and therefore fish will be less shy to bite (which has not yet been proven) he will have to accept the fact that fluorocarbon is inferior in all other aspects (except it's price) when compared to mono."
254566,singingdog,2008-10-02 10:02:00,1047," If you read both reviews, you will see that they tested 5 different knots: Improved Clinch, Palomar, Uni, Trilene, San Diego Jam. This is really the achilles heel of fluoro: for equal ""real world"" line strength you have to use a heavier fluoro.  Not sure where you are getting the ""dry only"" info. Here's a direct quote from the article: ""We performed tests with each line in both wet and dry conditions and were able to validate one claim right off the bat. That is, that fluorocarbon lines, do not absorb much water and were not very affected during our tests whether wet or dry. For this reason, the data presented here-in represents dry line conditions."""
252918,Dabluz,2008-09-26 17:02:00,701,"Yes....the size of the line is important.  I go fishing with lots of people.  I have been fishing for a very long time.  I use fine line.  I usually fish with 2 to 6 lb clear mono.  Not the fluorescent blue mono that we usually see in the stores but real clear mono and I almost always outfish everyone that fish with me.  I tried different types of fluorocarbon lines.....they are all crap.  I did stretch tests with fluorocarbon lines and they have just as much stretch as most monos.  I did strength tests with fluorocarbon lines and they are weaker than equivalent monos.  Even the famous Seaguar fluorocarbon line is junk unless you want to use over 40 lb test fluorocarbon.  Walleye and brook trout are line shy.  For brook trout I never use anything more than 4 lb test clear mono and for walleye, I use 4 to 6 lb test clear mono.  I know for a fact that just using a snap on the end of your line when fishing with a jig for walleye will decrease the number of bites.  I don't know why but I have seen it happen quite a few times with people who were fishing with me.  If there are pike and I don't want to lose a lure, I use 4 to 8 kg, 49 to 54 strand steel wire that I buy in Europe.  It's about the size of 6 lb mono and flexible enough to knot.  It's very expensive and when you get hooked on bottom and you have to apply extreme tension to rip your lure loose, the wire becomes curly queued....lol.  However, there are times when you have to use a more robust line.  I use 4 to 10 lb test Fireline when necessary.  Yes, the stuff does fray but it's the finest and the strongest line you can find.  I don't mind having to cut of a few inches after a day of fishing with Fireline.  For heavy fish or for very deep water fishing ( I often fish in 450 feet of water ), it's hard to beat a good braid in 20 to 30 lb test.  Get the braid that is 100% dyneema or spectra.  This means the stuff that does not have additional nylon or mono to make it rounder, stiffer etc.  There are not many braids out there that do not have this additional junk to make them larger and so called ""more manageable"".  The only braids that I know of without this extra junk are Mason Tiger Braid and Tuff Line.  Not the Tuff Line Plus or the Tuff Line XT....just the Tuff Line which is very hard to find.  When I use braid or Fireline for pike fishing and I don't want to lose the occaisonal lure, I add a leader of 49 to 54 strands of steel....8 kg test.  The stuff I buy in Europe.  I tie on a small swivel at one end and a small snap at the other end.  A 9 to 12 inch steel leader is ample.  Less than that and the pike can wrap the leader around his head and the line can end up in his mouth.  If you want to test your fluorocarbon against equivalent test mono, tie something to end of your line, put a bucket of sand on a bathroom scale, tie the line to the handle of the bucket of sand and pull while looking at the readout.  While you are at it, check the elasticity at the same time."
252939,bicephalic,2008-09-26 18:01:00,112,"IME it hasn't made much of a difference what line/setup is being used if the bite is on.  I can see how with clear water, live bait, species being fished for, lighter line may be useful, but here's an interesting situation:  On our last outing, my wife, myself, Johnnyb, and Laker Jessy were in two canoes.  Roughly 10'-20' apart.  Both running a Minn Kota Drift Sock out the back, going about the same speed.  All of us were using 3"" tube jigs, right on bottom for Smallies.  I'll ignore jig head size for the moment because I don't have the numbers.  I was using 14lb Mono, Johnnyb green power pro (__lb test?), Jessy red power pro (__lb test?), and my wife 10/12?lb flouro.  Nicole and I had a small swivel clip at the end of the line for simplicity.  I'm going to assume that the power pro's were doing the same for the moment (I'm sure I'll be corrected shortly if I'm wrong).  Nicole caught nothing on the fluoro ( a few small ones got off beside the boat); I got a few in the 1-2lb range on the mono; the two running power pro hooked into several, including two over 4lbs.  Doesn't speak volumes for fluoro; nor does it seem the power pro got in the way.  Until someone develops wireless fishing rods, this debate will go on and on...I think it's somewhere on the same list as wireless power bars"
253986,Dabluz,2008-09-30 16:42:00,701,For the fluorocarbon lover and haters.....look at this site for the first of 2 articles concerning independant tests on fluorocarbon lines.  The fluorocarbon lovers are in for a big surprise.  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewfluorocarbontest.html
254109,forrest,2008-09-30 22:11:00,1032,  Read the article.  Whats the big surprise?
254246,singingdog,2008-10-01 10:30:00,1047,"Great article! I certainly won't be buying Transition for it's ""invisibilty""   The article pretty much debunks several myths about fluorocarbon lines,  especially the ""no-stretch"". Good info about knots as well. If you want 10 lb test knot strength from fluoro, you have to upgrade to at least 12 lb test line, which probably erases most of the benefits of a light line."
