I know that it is now closed below dundas (HWY 5) but where can you park and fish this time of year.  I have only ever fished north of hwy 5 during the spring.  Any input would be great.  Even if you want to PM me.  Thanks!"
254777,Mattones,2008-10-02 21:00:00,587, its closed? I always see like 20 cars parked there before going to work and coming home for the past 2-3 weeks.
254780,kemper,2008-10-02 21:10:00,2232,"would have closed last saturday in sept.  And bronte is a snaggers heaven, there are lots of fish to be had but id wait it out for a bit so you dont have to deal with the frustration."
254783,Mattones,2008-10-02 21:14:00,587,So much for me and putting my waders in the car tonight and heading over there tomorrow after work:(
254789,xrap,2008-10-02 21:29:00,683,No it's not closed

254798,nautifish,2008-10-02 21:45:00,1416,I fished there last fall.  Not sure i ever want to fish they're again. I was sickened to the stomach with what i saw.  I agree it is for sure a snaggers heaven.
