254396,troutologist,2008-10-01 20:03:00,951,was there for a wedding about 3yrs ago. Great owners and clean spot. Bass fishing wasnt great right around the area but we did catch a few....only used the resorts canoe so didnt stray far or fish too hard.
254418,mikeh,2008-10-01 21:01:00,824,"I think muskies landing is close to the Port Severn locks , there are lots of sheltered areas to fish if it gets windy. I have no idea about the accomodations."
254430,camillj,2008-10-01 21:38:00,1988,"Really nice folks (I was there a couple years ago - to rent a boat) ... I love that part of GBAY for MONSTER musky ... be really careful though lots of shoals and strong current right off their docks - head out into the bay for Pike, Musky, Pickeral, Bass, Salmon, Channel Cats, Ling, Gar, Carp, oh .. and did I mention MUSKY ???"
254454,Mr. Follow,2008-10-01 22:50:00,34,Musky's landing is a great place to stay I have friends that stay there regularly and have had many clients stay there. great place and a great choice.
254466,Cast-Away,2008-10-01 23:28:00,790,I don't believe that you can launch a boat there with the low water levels.
254468,bigugli,2008-10-01 23:31:00,6138,"Haven't been in 4 years, but, place is clean, folks are friendly, and the fishing can be real good. If Severn sound gets rough you're only a few minutes from launching in 6 Mile, Goucester Pool or the Waubushene flats."
254674,addy79,2008-10-02 15:22:00,573,"thanks for all the info guys...  were primarily targeting ski's but would like to hit some smallies if luck permits.  Any tips on the musky action? we plan to hit islands and reefs with big baits lookin for cruisers. go big or go home!  looks like a nice little place, drove by it for years and finally decided to go check it out.  going with Reffrunner from the board, we will post our results when we get back"
254685,Reef Runner,2008-10-02 15:52:00,980,"Come on man, don't say ""go big or go home'.  We end up just going home, lol. Just kidding. Never been there, can't wait to try the sound and inner bays for some fall 'ski action.  If it's anything like the Moon, it's gonna be a tough fish but well worth the effort regardless.  Have the 'skis started to run and gun the shad inland yet?  I think we'll hit the islands around the sound looking for weed beds and shoals and move towards Gpool. Looks like a nice place, always thought about it when pasing by towards Parry Sound."
