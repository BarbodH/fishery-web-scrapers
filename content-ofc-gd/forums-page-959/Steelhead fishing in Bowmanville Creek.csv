I know there is a decent run in the creek but not sure what it's like right out in the front. I've seen enough ugly salmon this year and want to get a few 'bows  I normally fish the Ganny but it is a zoo right now. Can't get a decent drift with those crowds. It will be especially bad the next few weeks when they close it North of the CN bridge.  Replies with specifics would be great....I haven't fished the Bowmanville creek much aside from a few spots further up the river."

Take 1st right go over tracks and past the marina to the end. There is a place to park at the end of this street walk out to the pier and start casting."

I've never had a lotta luck there in the past few years, pretty hard to run a float or cast there, once the first rainbow has been caught . . . .    all bottom bangers lined up. If you thought the Ganny was bad . . . .   catch a 'bow at Bowmanville, and post a recognisable pic . . . ..   .   ."
