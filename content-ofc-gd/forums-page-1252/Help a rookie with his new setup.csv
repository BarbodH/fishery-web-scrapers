47272,GordieHowe,2007-03-15 02:52:00,4,"Hey guys, I'm thinking about getting a Daiwa Tierra. I usually fish the lakes (Rice, Simcoe, Kawarthas, etc.) for walleyes and sm/lm bass. From what I gather, 2500 seems to be a popular size for general purpose. Any good reason I should move up to a 3000? Also, I'm not really sure how line capacity ratings work. I was thinking about getting 150 yards of 20 lbs. test Sufix Performance Braid. Will this not fit on the spool? Should I not even be getting 20 lbs. test?  Thanks guys, any advice for this rookie would be appreciated."

47279,GordieHowe,2007-03-15 03:04:00,4," Sure, but the info is probably worth more."
47282,Joey,2007-03-15 03:09:00,9122,"What, did you buy a vowel Snag?  Joey"
47283,BabyHerc,2007-03-15 03:10:00,285,"Stick with the 2500.  3000 will be too large to balance with most bass and walleye rods.  You may even consider moving down to a 2000 size.  A little lighter and more compact than the 2500, but still plenty of line capacity.  As far as braid goes, 20lb is doable, but I prefer to drop down to 15lb on a spinning reel.  Fill the spool halfway with some regular mono that matches the diameter of the braid, then top it off with the braided line.  A spool of braid can fill both spools this way."

47292,snag,2007-03-15 03:33:00,1932," Rex is dead sexy    P.s Howie I agree with Herc. however, Shimano have a new line that is comparable"
47313,GordieHowe,2007-03-15 07:46:00,4," You're losing me.  How does one ""top off"" a spool with a different line? Do you just tie them together? Aside from cost, why would I use mono to fill the spool halfway? Sorry guys, I'm quite new at this. With 15 lbs. test, should I be worried about the line breaking if by some miracle I hook a big fat bass over 15 lbs.?  Last season I used 20 lb. Rapala Titanium Braid."
47442,bigbuck,2007-03-15 15:52:00,2449,"You're good with 20lb braid, I'm pretty sure the mono equivalent is either 6lb or 8lbtest. Filling up halfway with mono is a good idea to keep your costs down, (you can fill half way with cheap mono and spend a few extra dollars on good quality braid and have enough to fill an extra spool). Stick with a 2500 size, it's a good general purpose reel that would work great for walleye, bass, and even pike. A nice medium action rod and you'll be good to go."
47461,Bernie,2007-03-15 16:45:00,3190,"A good quality reel,2000 or 2500 series. I dont know anything about Daiwa reels. I use Shimano. The quality of the drag is vital. If you hook a fish with a weight over the rating of your line the drag is adjusted so the fish can take the line off the spool without breakage. The mono line is mostly a filler for the spool but also serves to prevent the more slippery braid from slipping on the spool. I have caught 20 lb pike on 6lb test line with a properly adjusted drag. The lighter the line you use will create ease of casting and less tangles. The biggest mistake I see with new fisherpeople is a spool that is not filled close to the lip. Stretching the line out after you spool it will help avoid tangles too.Use a line that has little or no ""memory"" I like fireline but have not tried some other types that others here have mentioned. Gotta go. ....Bernie"
47479,Hooked,2007-03-15 17:28:00,891,"Actually, I'm gonna buy the Tierra on Friday.  Its a sweet reel, by the sounds of things, I'll be using for the same applications as you and I'm picking up the 2500.  Here is a writeup on it:  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewdaiwatierra.html"
