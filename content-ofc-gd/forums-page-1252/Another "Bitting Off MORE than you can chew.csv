47515,BLACKFISH88,2007-03-15 19:29:00,191,if the perch was in bass' mouth and bass had perch in his mouth which one bit the lure. just wonderin?
47527,mepps,2007-03-15 19:51:00,1301,"lol, thats what i was trying to figure out blackfish..."
47541,Victor,2007-03-15 20:41:00,1609,i was thinking about that too mepps and blackfish ...  that happened to me once but the tailend of the perch was in the largie's mouth... because i hooked the perch and the bass came after it thinking that the perch was wounded or something (it's the bass in my avatar) ... which makes more sense lol
47549,Fishn Technishn,2007-03-15 21:20:00,198,"Guess what? Neither one had a lure in it's mouth! I was fishin' with my kids & heard all this splashing going on, went to see what the ruckus was all about. Found these two doin' the oral thing. Pretty cool to see it firsthand. As I mentioned, I released both....after thinking about it a while, maybe I should have hooked them up for Musky bait!! Just kidding. FT"
