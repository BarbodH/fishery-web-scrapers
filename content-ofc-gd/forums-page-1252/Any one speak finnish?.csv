46777,OhioFisherman,2007-03-14 03:03:00,6623,will you settle for gibberish?
46797,pameladallaire,2007-03-14 03:31:00,470,"My maiden name is LUOMA, and my father was Finnish but my parents were divorced so I never learned the language.  It's embarrasing walking into a community place around here when someone walks up and starts talking Finn.  I really LOOK like one.  Sigh!  Pam"
46853,aplumma,2007-03-14 11:03:00,6896,Dont listen to the song it will get stuck in your head and then you will start looking for its meaning........   Art
46881,ccmtcanada,2007-03-14 12:23:00,7971," Pam...I know your pain...LOL.  I am obviously Asian...of Japanese decent to be exact.  I get people coming up to me speaking Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc.... I just look at them and ask if they speak English.  You see.....I'm 4th generation Canadian...my family first immigrated here in the late 1800's.  The language was lost a few generations ago.  My friends joke that I am more Canadian than they are, because most of their parents immigrated to Canada from Europe in the 60's.  My mother speaks Japanese, but she learned out of interest...went to school to learn it.  The style she learned was ""proper"" and not ""conversational"".   Much like how we learned French.  So when true Japanese people speak to her, she has a hard time understanding them."

47034,Mike Colaneri,2007-03-14 18:42:00,9,"As DanC said alot of ""Finns"" in Thunder Bay.  While growing up there, I had a Finnish history teacher.  I'm of Italian descent and I guess he was dying to try his new joke out on me....What's the first thing they teach the Italian army? he says...""I don't know, what"" I answer....he then raises his hands in the air as if to surrender.  Ya, ya, har, har....So I fired one back at him.....""Mr V. I said, ""Whats the closest thing to a fishes bum hole?""  He shrugs his shoulders and that's when i hit him....""A Fin!""  I spent the rest of his class in the cafeteria."
