47310,xrap,2007-03-15 05:13:00,683,"I have been trying to get a hold of the 2007 regulations for a while now and today i went to fishing world and they said thier not out yet. And I have heard there have been some changes made from last year. So what do we go by the 2006 regulations still, and does anyone know when the 2007 ones are going to be out?"
47311,Guest skeeter99,2007-03-15 05:30:00,0,you got it man use the 2006 regs for now  the mnr announced this back in december i believe
47325,taper,2007-03-15 11:28:00,611,The mnr has said they will publicly announce (newspapers etc.) when the new regs are available.
47367,irishfield,2007-03-15 13:21:00,26272,Yep 2006 regs for now...BUT there are some changes already in effect...like Musky 2 weeks later in the west arm of Nippissing.  Go to http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/ and read it all for yourself to avoid any misconceptions.
47379,Fishmaster,2007-03-15 13:44:00,920,Was at a MNR meeting last week ..New Regs will be out within 2 weeks ....talk about a little behind ..
47383,Garyv,2007-03-15 13:45:00,547,"The hatchery coordinator of our club made reference to the regs at out meeting on Tuesday.  He was told by the MNR people the new regs COULD be out in May but nothing is for sure yet.  I personally wouldn't be surprised if we don't see them until Fall of this year or Jan 2008.  He was told to basically follow the 2006 until further notice, with some exception, see Wayne's post above."
47389,just2manylures,2007-03-15 13:52:00,144,As long as they are out before the ice thaws its fine by me.
47404,bigfish1965,2007-03-15 14:12:00,3382,"Since there was changes that required Federal Approval, it could take awhile."
47425,Fishmaster,2007-03-15 15:13:00,920,The women that sends me the Regs and Lic said they will be out soon ...along with Moose & Turkey Lic
47476,irishfield,2007-03-15 17:25:00,26272,"In aviation ... ""soon"" with Transport Canada = 3 years. Getting around to it = 5 years before that.  Hopefully the MNR is a tad quicker..but if the changes haven't gone thru the National Gazzet(sp) yet it will be months yet."
47495,Terry,2007-03-15 17:57:00,14456,I just saw a fishing show with Babe Winkleman and he was proud to state that the Ont. Gov. sends him and his family a free complimentary fishing license every year...wish they would give me a free one
47663,Weeds,2007-03-16 02:23:00,782,"It's pretty pathetic that the regs are not out yet. You can see the 2005/2006 regs online, sure, but fat lot of good that does you if you happen to be driving from one lake to another and want to know if you happen to be in a sanctuary or other exception to the rules zone. Lots of places no longer have the old regs around anymore so anglers have to commit to memory which species are in season, in what numbers they can be harvested and for rookies what they even look like. If the ministry wants people to take conservation seriously then they have to get off their collective ass. It's rediculous."
47666,bigfish1965,2007-03-16 02:26:00,3382,Let me see if I can say this more clearly...IT IS NOT THE MNR THAT IS HOLDING THIS UP! Many parts of the new regs require FEDERAL approval and the Feds haven't done it yet. Now you know why some fish have a one day closed season...so the MNR doesn't have to jump through hoops like this too often.
47668,irishfield,2007-03-16 02:34:00,26272,If you cared what the regs where in 2005/2006 then you would still have a copy of the printed regs to follow in the interm. I have one at home and one at the lake until such time as the 2007/2008 comes out in print. Many guys carry one in their glove box of the truck/car.  Like Rick has said above and I put in everyone of these reg posts...any federal legislation/regulations have to make 2 trips thru the National Gazzet (one with proposal - then time for public input period - then second time thru) before they can become law.
47673,bpsbassman,2007-03-16 02:47:00,941,"So Wayne, when does Musky open on the West Arm? Before Lakair I hope."
47679,irishfield,2007-03-16 02:53:00,26272,Third Saturday...which would be the 16th..I'll be there the 18th to grab the first one (I hope)! It used to be 1st Saturday in the West Arm and 3rd East of Hwy #64...which made no sense at all...
47680,Weeds,2007-03-16 02:56:00,782,"My annoyance should be directed at the Federal Government instead perhaps. Of course I cared about the regulations in 2005 and 2006, so much so that I took them with me on a typical fishing outing. ...That's why they wear out. Had I known they would have to last me perhaps I would have taken better care of them. There's also lots of new anglers who wouldn't have copies of the regulations as they weren't fishing back then. Also, not everyone has easy access to the internet to view the regs; especially while on the road."
47776,taper,2007-03-16 11:27:00,611,Just about every tackle shop I have been in lately has copies of last years regs on hand so new fisherman or not they are available if you take the time to look for them.
