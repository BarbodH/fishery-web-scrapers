47062,just2manylures,2007-03-14 20:08:00,144,I spoke to that guy last year at the fishing show.  I never got around to booking a trip.  Looks like fun though
47168,Dave Mercer,2007-03-14 23:12:00,148,"Hi All, That's my buddy Capt Art. He is the man! A day with him is awesome! If you want a trip of a lifetime book a trip with Art and you will freak. I will be back there for sure this year. Some of you may have seen the shark video we sent out earler this year that was shot with Art. For those who did not see it it's on my site. If you want to talk to Art he will be down at the Sportsmens Show in the Shimano booth.  Dave Mercer www.factsoffishing.com"
