47592,tjsa,2007-03-15 23:16:00,1578,"I lost my dad back in 2001, at the age of 74, and he was the one who taught me creek fishing for specks.  Spent many a day with him in summer persuing them, when he was available to do it. He then entered into an agreement with 4 other guys, my uncle, and 3 others whom I knew well, and purchased a lease agreement from CN on a property near Atikokan, and that is where I spent one whole heckuva lot of time in my teens to  early 20's. Fond memories, that will last a lifetime, glad you had your dad around a bit longer than I did, and cherish the memories spent with him. My dad was technically a veteran also, but he did not see any action, he was on a ship headed overseas when the war ended, and it turned around and went back to Nova Scotia? HMCS Cornwall?? if I remember correctly, he was a stoker on a Corvette. He also was stationed in Esquimalt BC,(before he was in the east of Canada) and i have pictures of the Japanese ""prisoner"" ships he took still around here somewheres."
47597,Cookslav,2007-03-15 23:28:00,1457,"Dang,  Sorry to hear of your loss... My Thoughts go out to you and your family, and My sincere Thanks to another vet. R.I.P."

47090,kemper,2007-03-14 20:43:00,2232,"I think when my dad gave a speech at my great grandmother's funeral he said it best.  ""The other day I looked up forever in the dictionary, it said 91 years, and though we all feel like it was not long enough life did not owe her anything""   My great grandmother lived life to the fullest, and it seems your father did too. May he rest in peace.  I know theres  a big lake up theres somewhere that he is forever fishing!"

He sounds like he was a Great Man as well as a Great Father... Remember all the fond and great times you both had together and pass them on to your children the same as he passed them on to you... There is a song out that has a saying  ""If I could only be half the man he was"" or something along those words... then he would be just as proud of you for being his son.. Speak Proudly when you say his name.. He deserves it"
