If there are any other OFC members who are in our area and need a passport, please mention the site and we'll give you a special price! It has been absolutely crazy with all the new regs.

47241,Frankypro,2007-03-15 01:33:00,63,Did my own with my inkjet printer and digital camera.  The fine print says Passport quality photo.  With the proper sizing and following the instructions should be good to go.  In fact I'm waiting for my refusal I mean approval soon.

47268,DT10Sam,2007-03-15 02:36:00,480,"You do not need to get a passport photo at all.  A digital camera is fine have a white background and make sure the pic is the size that they require on the application. We generally take photos of our students when they complete their PAL course and send it in with their apps.  We have not had an application retiurned.  Hope this is of help.  Regards, Sam"
