46665,Slowhand,2007-03-14 00:15:00,13,Just saying hello to everyone. Signed up today (really should have joined sooner). I keep my boat up on Gloucester pool (11 years now). Before that fished Sturgeon Lake for about 10 years. Spent time and $ collecting some JDM reels and rods. Really not much to add other than I'm kind of tackle crazy and can't wait until season opener. It's good to be here.
