46913,LeXXington,2007-03-14 13:52:00,1928,
46916,Joey,2007-03-14 13:58:00,9122,"I saw this thread early this morning, but waited until I got to work and had my coffee and breafast in front of me so I could enjoy it, and enjoy it I did.  What an awesome report Bunk.  Fantastic.  Always look forward to them.  Joey"
46920,b2kptbo,2007-03-14 13:59:00,1505,"Great report and pic's, thanks..."
46925,wallacio,2007-03-14 14:08:00,475,Now THAT  is an ice fishing report!!!
46928,douG,2007-03-14 14:11:00,2693,"Attaboy, Moosebunk.  We at OFC are really lucky to get to make these trips with you, at least I feel I was there.  I think there is some nice $ inside these great reports.  You write well and should be published.  Check with Justin Hoffman and JP, please.  You deserve to be on the newstands.  I'd be looking for your byline on the front cover fer sure.  Thanks."
46933,Tomcat,2007-03-14 14:22:00,395,Thanks again for sharing such a great adventure (as usual)!!!
46936,Fishnfiend,2007-03-14 14:28:00,357," Sounds like you have a great job Joey. Me, too."
46938,mattyk,2007-03-14 14:30:00,2110,thanks for a great read! Some beautiful fish.
46940,beerman,2007-03-14 14:32:00,118,"wow, awesome!! Question moose, do people ice fish Edgar lake??"
46951,Moosebunk,2007-03-14 14:53:00,3970,"Glad ya like all.  Solo - I hope things don't change.  I believe Charlie is keeping his job there and it's his belief practices shouldn't change.  Beerman - Edgar has great fishing I hear, and in the past I understand it was iced fish more, but not really at all now from as far as I know.  It wouldn't make sense really either.  Kesagami is about 3km away and is the better fishery."
46953,beerman,2007-03-14 14:59:00,118,"Thanks moose, damn your lucky ... Maybe you can come into edgar and have a few cold ones when i get there?? LOL"
46964,kissmybass,2007-03-14 15:36:00,36,"  wow, awesome report... i'm impressed! great day, to say the least! good job"
46969,Rob,2007-03-14 15:41:00,467,Nice... Very Nice!!!   Rob C
46976,dustink,2007-03-14 15:56:00,526,"Wow!  Thanks for the story MB.....that's more than just a ""report"".  Thanks for letting me tag along.  dk"
46999,setomonkey,2007-03-14 17:04:00,872,"Great report & pics.  I'd have to agree with douG, you should think about whether you'd like to submit one of your reports to a magazine like Ontario Out Of Doors. Remote locations (at least to us southerners), great scenery, and you tell a good story. Justin Hoffman writes for them regularly, and there are some other folks here who also write for magazines.  Mike"
47025,Tacklebuster,2007-03-14 18:15:00,303,"Another Great report Moosebunk, I was starting to suffer from withdrawl."
47027,just2manylures,2007-03-14 18:26:00,144,Now that is a report!

47035,GbayGiant,2007-03-14 18:49:00,1780,"I did my homework, and found a pick of those yellow beavers, feisty looking creatures.  That pike looks at least 20lbs to me, those scales never work right, caught a 31"" walleye last year that was 4lbs on those hanging scales. lol."
47055,drufis,2007-03-14 19:55:00,45,"Wow, great report, that is what it is all about."
47140,walleyejigger,2007-03-14 22:13:00,876,"it's not too often i'd say drilling thru 40""+ of ice is worth it, but for that trip..... definately, good job"
47280,Motorhead,2007-03-15 03:07:00,163,Moosebunk....  As usual another FANTASTIC report.....  thanks for sharing....   Doug
47295,Moosebunk,2007-03-15 03:42:00,3970,"Thanks all.  Kesagami is one fun report in the making.  Will post another tomorrow likely and even more before March is done.  SetoM and others wondering... yeah, you may see some report type trips printed in pages in the future.  Writing is cool, photography is cooler, both I find fun.  Glad yas enjoyed this one."
47306,mepps,2007-03-15 04:22:00,1301,"wow, nice pike!!"
47387,Smokey,2007-03-15 13:50:00,1278,Thanks Moose thats the winter report I've been waiting for. Great as usual and I'm extremely jealous.  Thanks again. Now I'll be watching for your opener. Congrats on a great one.

46814,Jen,2007-03-14 04:10:00,833,"How can you make a ""Fast Reply"" to a post like that... I sat here , reading extra slowly to enjoy every word.  What beautiful pictures! The visuals created by your choreography were perfect.  WOW, looks like you had the kind of day that makes dreams happen!"
46819,carll2,2007-03-14 04:20:00,443,wowwww awesome report once again moosebunk..nice eye.. just for fun are there any jobs available in your neck of the woods lol? whats the next report?
46820,GbayGiant,2007-03-14 04:28:00,1780,"Amazing day on or off the ice with those beauties, congratulations on the new PB walleye. Must have been tricky bending that pike out at a 1 foot depth.  Oh, and what the he1! is a yellow beaver ? can you post the pic up, or did I miss the inside joke."
46822,Ron,2007-03-14 04:33:00,1683,Just speechless on a report like that!
46825,camillj,2007-03-14 05:43:00,1988,Wow .. that was awesome Moosebunk .... seemed like I was right there with ya ... thanks for sharing
46829,SlowPoke,2007-03-14 08:10:00,2984,"Thanks Moose, you just saved me $3000 on a fly-in trip of a lifetime! -Brian"
46837,solopaddler,2007-03-14 09:34:00,8605,"Awesome report and really healthy looking pike What I find encouraging is the size of the walleyes! Back when I fished and guided on Kesagami there were tons of walleye's, but mostly on the smaller side. Nice to see tangible results of the conservation program started by the lodge 14 years ago paying dividends. I had heard that Bob and Marsha recently sold the lodge back to the native peoples...would be curious to know if they're going to continue with the same stringent policies."
46839,Rich Clemens,2007-03-14 09:48:00,3131,Great report Moosebunk ...makes us feel like we were actually there.  Of course ... who wouldn't wish to be.  Looks like a very successful day.
46841,Dano,2007-03-14 09:52:00,719,Good stuff bunk! Looks like you had a hoot.

Question for ya,why all the layers of clothing,it,s in the double digits here. LOL   Thanks again for sharing your adventure."
46856,OhioFisherman,2007-03-14 11:08:00,6623,"Great pictures, the big pike looked a bit more than 15. Nice fish!"
46860,taper,2007-03-14 11:27:00,611,Fantastic post and as a side note I just finished reading your article in Essox and was very impressed. Great work.
46865,Basskicker,2007-03-14 11:43:00,421,Simply awesome report once again...40-42 inches of ice....holy crap. I plan on being in that general area on May 25 for a week...I hope the ice is gone by then.  That's certaintly one big pike and huge walleye for up north. Congrats....  Jason

46903,Garyv,2007-03-14 13:33:00,547,"Kesigami is one of my all time favorite summer lakes, it doesn't look like it would be any different in winter.  What a great day on the ice."
46908,Fishnfiend,2007-03-14 13:37:00,357,"  Thanks for a great read, accompanied by some nice pictures of beautiful fish.  You definitely do it up right. Looks like Bren got a bit of sun!
