Anyway, I just finished mapping out the lakes in Algonquin on ActivityGuidebook.com which were stocked. There were 35,000+ Rainbow, and 35,000 Splake in 2006 with a total of over 150,000 since 2002. If you are planning a trip to Algonquin this year you should check out the link directly, or you start at Algonquin Park, select the map, zoom in and move around.  Cheers..."
