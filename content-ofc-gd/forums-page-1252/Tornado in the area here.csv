47335,OhioFisherman,2007-03-15 11:48:00,6623,"It hit by a shopping mall on the Lorain- Elyria Ohio border. Lucky no one was hurt! Typical storm damage, roofs blown off, trees down, a garden center lost a lot of roofs from their green houses, sheet metal blown off stores fronts.  68 degrees yesterday afternoon and snow on the ground now, the heavy wet stuff. LOL Wayne, I don`t remember a Tornado this early in March here. The swirling winds? They started the campaign for the 2008 elections early! LOL  Schools delayed start 2 hours, black ice freezing rain. Careful on the roads if it`s headed your way!"
