46958,irishfield,2007-03-14 15:21:00,26272," Weighs less than my truck Paul...and has tracks to spread the load..so why not. A few years back he had the OPP drive out and park beside him (6800lbs on 4 small load patches) and tell him they were going to charge him with endangering the lives of those that would have to save him...while he drove his maybe 3000 lb dozer on 8' x 16"" foot tracks. Who's the real mental case in that senerio?  Mike, as for the trout...wasn't the best fish I've ever tasted. Next time I'm gonna try frying it instead of baking it I think....or on the BBQ"
46960,dustink,2007-03-14 15:31:00,526,Great story told there....thanks for sharing the pics!  dk
46967,Rob,2007-03-14 15:37:00,467,Nice work there boys!! Those trout probably taste alot better than those Simcoe trout!   Rob C
46979,LeXXington,2007-03-14 15:57:00,1928,"Great report, looked cold"
46981,irishfield,2007-03-14 16:03:00,26272,"Wind was a wicked on Friday Paul..but temps were about -10C when we started Friday am. Got up to about -4C and later in the day I took refuge behind an island as a wind break. Saturday was about 2C in the afternoon with instant sled ski freeze down if you stopped, Sunday was -12C to start and got up to about 3C. When we left Monday afternoon it was 5C and about time to get the jet drive out.."
46986,Cookslav,2007-03-14 16:20:00,1457,Looks like a great time. Sure got me itching for some spring Laker action... On another month and a half Thanks for sharing
46993,Tybo,2007-03-14 16:35:00,1373,Thats a good one about the dozer.  What would be interesting is when the OPP was there and they broke though whom would have got the blame?  Great report Guy. Looks like every one had fun.
47003,Bly,2007-03-14 17:15:00,1556,"Thanks for Sharing Wayne.....and fish too!!   Pictures of the ""naps"" were a nice addition    How wonderful to have a place like that to get away and to share with your friends....good for you!!     bly"
47022,Tacklebuster,2007-03-14 18:03:00,303,"Great report, fun times for sure.  I love the Temagami area."
47033,icefisherman,2007-03-14 18:37:00,952,"Wayne,  looking at the picture with the steak and other food I remember the overfilled refrigeration at the cottage on BOQ last fall ha ha Dan seems to like the ""light dinners"" ;-)) Nice report interesting read and loved all the pictures.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
47598,irishfield,2007-03-15 23:30:00,26272,Yah Emil...we need more food planning in our trips. Everyone seems to bring enough for everyone and we end up taking way too much stuff back home with us. Ron had lunch stuff for every day we were there and so did Dano due to a bit of miscommunication. If you look at the pictures...you'll see we could all survive a week or two without eating.....  We'll plan better for our fall BOQ trip...so there's room in the fridge for at least one of your meals this time! LOL
47600,Smokey,2007-03-15 23:33:00,1278,Awesome Report Wayne. Thanks
47624,Moosebunk,2007-03-16 00:35:00,3970,Hard to see yas for all the slush.  Holy crow. lol.  Great outing Wayne and crew.  Looks like some doods got a little too much fresh air and crashed out on their sleds.  Zzzzzzz's
47630,Rich Clemens,2007-03-16 00:52:00,3131,Great report Wayne and love viewing all those pics.
47643,Pigeontroller,2007-03-16 01:38:00,2793,"Nice pics Wayne, almost makes ice fishing look like fun..."
46772,Mike the Pike,2007-03-14 03:00:00,3421,Awesome report Wayne.Love the sunset pics.Looks like you enjoyed all that fat free food.Who's the little Tike who likes to drown that delicious food with lots of Ketchup?I can apreciate all those pics.I made a post with 30 pics Saturday and that takes alot of time.My first report was detaled like yours .I was thirty minutes into making the first report half way done and the dam computer froze.Lost every thing and had to start over.The second one got really short I was too tired.You do all this on dial up man you are patient.Check my report with Roy.Lac St.Louis.Little kid caught a sturgeon.  What a way to end the weekend Suzie homemaker and the 3 Betty Crockers do 4 days of dishes.Lots of dried ketchup on the plates. Thanks for sharing Wayne.MTP
46806,irishfield,2007-03-14 03:48:00,26272,"You put Ketchup on your fries don't ya.....  I learned today the hard way as well Mike..with lost to cyber space posting. Do it in Word first and then copy and paste! If it freezes..you still have it! Even still...it was about 2 hours to down size the pics, upload to my own website using FTP Pro and then doing the report and pasting in the addresses for each picture.  Dano is ""Suzie"" then...he washed them all. I dried a few and put them away. That Ron guy and the lads didn't do any...they'd left the day before! ( in all fairness....Ron wanted to on Sunday..but I told him not to waste the water and made them fish instead)"
46812,Sherriff,2007-03-14 04:05:00,252,"Nice work Wayne, glad to see you getting into some numbers...  Great report.  SHerriff"
46817,Ron,2007-03-14 04:16:00,1683,"Great report Wayne!  It felt almost as if I was there! Too bad we didn't have any pictures of the ""TOW CALLS"".  There is a lot of interesting water up there for sure, looking forward to the next invite. It is nice to see the different year classes come out of your lake, goes to show it is very healthly. Glad I could prove you don't have to catch a fish to have a great time!  You definately have a nice place to call home, especially for the Summer. I had a blast with all of you guys, nice to meet Dano in person and have a sit down with him too.  I tell ya one thing though, you guys have got to lighten up, don't take life so seriously! LOL It seemed like this was the ""CLASS CLOWN REUNION"". That about sums it up."
46818,GbayGiant,2007-03-14 04:17:00,1780,"Great report Wayne, congrats on the first ice fish and another one the next day, you guys did good."
46851,OhioFisherman,2007-03-14 11:01:00,6623,"Great pictures Wayne, dude takes a dozer on the ice?"
46943,setomonkey,2007-03-14 14:35:00,872,"Great report, Wayne, sounds like a great weekend.  Hope you enjoyed that laker, trout is my favourite fish to eat.  Mike"
