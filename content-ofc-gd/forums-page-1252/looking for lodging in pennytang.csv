Saw a few rental adds in there today, don't know of any fishing lodges though  Here is a site I found that might be helpful to you  http://rentalo.com/d/midland/ontario_fishing_lodge.htm  http://rentalo.com/119801/cottageona.html  How many are in your group? How big of a place are you looking for?  Hope this helps some  Maureen"
