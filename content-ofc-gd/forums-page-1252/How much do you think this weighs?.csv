47057,dumaurier,2007-03-14 20:05:00,3,"Hey gentlemen,  Just curious if you could guess how much this pike weighs?  It was sent to me by a buddy who had no idea what his friend had caught.  I have no idea but it is huge.  James  PS I hope these attachments work because I am not computer savvy!  "
47060,irishfield,2007-03-14 20:06:00,26272,His friend didn't catch it either.....  First fish was caught in Holland/Netherlands last year...second fish don't know..but that one's been around for years.
47061,just2manylures,2007-03-14 20:07:00,144,That pic has been around the net for a while now.  I think it was caught in Finland??  50lbs plus for sure on the 2many scale
47064,dumaurier,2007-03-14 20:10:00,3,"Sorry about this gentlemen,  This was my biggest fear.  A hoax.  I'll have to tell my friend that he was deceived and needless to say that I am greatly embarrassed.  This is the last time that I post a picture which I was told was authentic.  Sincerely,  james"
47066,irishfield,2007-03-14 20:13:00,26272,No harm.. no foul.. James...stick around ...introduce yourself and enjoy OFC.
47068,kemper,2007-03-14 20:26:00,2232,"Dont worry about it bud, your not the first nor will you be the last person to get caught by that one!  stick around, youll see it plenty of times im sure!  welcome to OFC"
47069,dumaurier,2007-03-14 20:28:00,3,"Thanks Irishfield,  I have not posted in about six months and recently noticed that my original login and password were no longer valid.  Just curious if anything has changed.  Sincerely,  James"
47070,irishfield,2007-03-14 20:30:00,26272,"New board stated in November due to a mess using Proboards servers. If you haven't been since then, then that is why. Thought the handle looked a tad familiar."
47071,BabyHerc,2007-03-14 20:32:00,285,"I would say close to 60 lbs.  It's not a fake, but it sure as hell ain't a North American fish.  Nothin's changed James!!!"
