47008,bpsbassman,2007-03-14 17:25:00,941,You should be able to start fishing that secret spot in pic2 very soon. My understanding is that everything in that body of water is currently open
47046,BabyHerc,2007-03-14 19:38:00,285,"LOL Roger!  Marko, the last fish is a bowfin.  You can find them in shallow, weedy waters, where yoo would normally find bass or carp.  They are very aggressive, fight very hard, and have teeth that would make a musky jealous."
