47620,Moosebunk,2007-03-16 00:29:00,3970,Bren and I are RN's.
47631,Rob,2007-03-16 00:57:00,467," You and your wife are very much needed up there I hear. I went to Queens with a guy that taught up there, he loved it and brought back a ton of pictures to show the hunting course he taught to the kids, amazing land up there.   Rob C"

47448,Hooked,2007-03-15 16:01:00,891,"Wow, another sweet report.  I still can't believe you are catching fish that shallow.  Good stuff and it was a good read too."
47453,tbayboy,2007-03-15 16:16:00,1497,Great report Moose thanks.

47469,dustink,2007-03-15 17:03:00,526,"Writing a great story is a gift.  I don't have it, but wish I did.  You MB, have it.  Another great read....and that last line (...and the fecal matter nearing the point of no return was safely retracted back to a warm and cozy place.) is classic.  Thanks for making my afternoon better!  dk"
47475,jediangler,2007-03-15 17:20:00,1923,Great story and pics MB. That is one fine pike there my friend.
47478,b2kptbo,2007-03-15 17:27:00,1505,"Man ""O"" Man!!! beauty report..."
47481,Bly,2007-03-15 17:28:00,1556,Speechless      Please do let me know if you ever publish your memoirs......what a great read   bly
47483,irishfield,2007-03-15 17:40:00,26272,"LOL Drew They paint the thing Yeller so the MNR thinks they'z already there and don't land? LOL  You did pretty good Drew and it's wise to know as much as you can about what you are riding in...mind you some times it's better not to know..lol  3600lb gross is correct on a '70 C206E. Generally around 1750 empty..so leaves 1850lb for gear/people/fuel. IF Dexter would shed a few pounds you could take Summer along as well. lol Seeing the three blade prop he may have an engine upgrade in there but standard is a Continental IO-520-F 285 Hp Continuous and 300 for take off (just checked the TC register and this is the engine in there). That is a 6 cylinder yes..but opposed..air cooled...not a V block. SKis look like Kehlers...fixed penetration. Ride home sounded fun ! Been there...done that...and I don't care how calm Dexter looked....his fecal matter was poppin proud as well !  Absolutely great read Drew and what a way to go fishing. I've got to start getting out in the winters via air and dropping in on the back lakes myself around here.  Cheers, Wayne  Here's one of my ?able trips North in 2005 ! Problem is you have to come down sooner or later... "
47510,Moosebunk,2007-03-15 19:10:00,3970,"Think he mentioned the engine upgrade Wayne.  After that he said something about why it then sounds louder on the ground or something.  4 of us fit in there last year.  We didn't take the auger, just the essentials.  Couple bigger dudes coming up later in the month so Bren may have difficulty coming along again.  Not to worry.  And, as soon as their is a real warm half day, if the timing is right, Summer will have a blast."
47517,Fishnfiend,2007-03-15 19:36:00,357,Entertaining to say the least.  Thanks for a good read and a couple chuckles. I can't believe the pike you get out of less than a foot of water.   Didn't you mention a video...?
47518,irishfield,2007-03-15 19:37:00,26272,Nah...that was just the blown exhaust that they can't afford to buy or have shipped to never never land ! LOL
47566,Dano,2007-03-15 22:05:00,719,Another Academy contender. Good stuff Bunk!
