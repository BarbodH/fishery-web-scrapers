46998,setomonkey,2007-03-14 17:01:00,872,I don't know anything about towing a boat (not a boat owner) but I learned a lot from this thread.  Thanks guys for the different opinions and information.  Mike
47000,Flappn,2007-03-14 17:04:00,245,I used to have a Pro Sport 150 Legend with a four stroke 25 and used to tow it with a Toyota Corolla. I will admit it wasn't the best tow vehicle..however I took it easy...stopped well in advance and never had any problems.
47097,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-14 20:49:00,4399, I agree Tybo but there are a lot of people who do and will continue too tow a rig with a car personally i think it`s risky and potentially very dangerous I just hope that when those little 4 cylinder car parts start breaking under the strain I am not any where nearby.
47124,cisco,2007-03-14 21:44:00,597,"Thanks for the link Percher. I skimmed it and got this...... and even though the article is from Australia, it must come close to the way gov't treats vehicles here. They're in cahoots you know! LOL!  Here's a passage re what a vehicle without a towing-amount sticker cantow, that was interesting...  "" When the trailer doesnâ€™t have brakes installed, the maximum capacity will be equal to the unladen mass of the motor vehicle.""  To me that means you shouldn't tow anything almost as heavy as the empty towing vehicle. So it seems in Australia at least, a car is allowed to tow a light 14ft tinny with motor around, since there ain't no way a 14ft tinny with trailer and motor weighs as much as the tow vehicle."
47332,Chris,2007-03-15 11:44:00,405," Whatever.  Bottom line is.....if you are NOT comfortable merely following the tow capacity rating of your vehicle, by all means knock yourself out with extra brakes, jake brakes, oil coolers, tranny coolers, beefed up shocks, coil overs , etc. etc. Nobody will criticize you for it.  For those who are comfortable making and living by their own decisions, just follow the recommended tow capacity and you will be fine (except for a bit of criticism from those who disagree with you).  "
45926,Mike the Pike,2007-03-12 04:02:00,3421, Well charles I would have to disagree with the front wheel drive for a boat launch.I have a front wheel drive Odessey if the launch is dry pavement I do not have a problem.if the launch is gravel.the front wheel starts digging a hole.If its wet its useless.A good set of traction aids slipped uner the wheels can help.  when you have tongue weight at the back of your front wheel drive it will hinder the traction to the front wheels.  With weight on a rear wheel drive (the tongue weight)this will help the rear wheels gain traction.I can not wait for the day I no longer launch with a front wheel drive.When the boat ramp sucks so does the front wheel drive.believe me its useless.
45977,pikehunter,2007-03-12 12:50:00,1659," So then you are probably more concerned with the cars ability to drag the boat up the ramp then it's actual ability to tow distances? You owned a Windstar, right? Was that your tow vehicle before? If so and it could pull the boat up the ramp then why would the Saturn not be able to do it? Both are front wheel drive, and the Windstar is nothing but a front wheel drive station wagon and not a truck anyway.  So then if you are only a block from the ramp and you are not going to drag your boat any distance then do it. After the first couple of attempts you will have your question answered."
45992,Nanook,2007-03-12 14:09:00,565," When you purchase a vehicle with a ""Tow package"", They dont put bigger brakes on for you. While brakes on a trailer are  a definate +, I dont understand your statement re;' the towing abilities are based on the size of ths vehicle brakes'Wanna run this by me again?"
46033,Tybo,2007-03-12 15:40:00,1373,"I get it now. My truck weighs 7200lbs, The GVWR is 9200lbs. the truck is capable of hauling 2700lbs. the max tow weight is 16700lbs. The max braking distance at 60mph is 190'.  Now I have 2100lbs of top soil in the back(using top soil as a reference because it wont move) also towing a 5000lbs trailer with a 11000lb back hoe on it.  So now what you are telling me. That with out trailer brakes, a exhaust brake and Jake brake. That the guy in the civic that just powered brake in front of at 60mph and 200' away will be safe and cozie. Because I'll get my truck stop.  I don't think so."
46053,charlesn,2007-03-12 16:33:00,551,Never realized it would be a problem with FWD.  Maybe 4x4 is the only way to be really sure that you'll be able to get up the ramp.  The only vehicles I have ever seen stuck at a ramp were rear-wheel drive though.  Good to know that about front wheel drives.  I guess I will stick to 4x4s and bending over at the gas pumps to enjoy my hobby.  Charles
46305,cisco,2007-03-13 10:18:00,597,"If the tires slip at the ramp some folks recommend keeping a small pail of cat litter, road salt, sand/gravel mix in the trunk. I'm not sure that cat litter is best for the environment, but a small pail of sand with a bit of gravel in it should get you out re algae or wet ramp or even a bit of ice."
46309,Greencoachdog,2007-03-13 10:35:00,8163,"    Cat litter is dried clay.  Why worry with and go thru all the hassel of trying to tow with an unsuitable vehicle?  Towing concerns should be a priority when a vehicle is purchased, if you're a trailered boat owner.  Towing with an improper vehicle puts excess strain and wear on an unsuitable vehicle, resulting in costly repair bills and an accelerated maintainence schedule... not to mention the hazardous safety aspects!  ... anybody that tries to argue these points doesn't really know what they're talking about."
46352,Chris,2007-03-13 12:51:00,405," I don't really see anyone suggesting to tow with an unsuitable vehicle.....if the weight of your trailer and equipment is less than the towing capacity of the vehicle why would anyone spend money to upgrade. Why would automakers list a towing capacity on a car if cars were not suitable for towing as someone else has suggested. C'mon, this guy is talking about towing a 14' aluminum boat w/15hp motor and some are suggesting beefed up suspension, brakes, oil and tranny coolers, etc., etc. Some of you guys must be mechanics they way you are selling expensive auto upgrades. I can see adding a tranny cooler for automatic transmissions (approx. $100 to $150 installed) that's about it. As far as safety, whether your under your towing capacity or not, extra distance is required to stop....anyone towing/driving like a maniac because they feel safe with upgrades is just as much a danger on the road as someone pulling under their limit without upgrades. Adding upgrades may give some a false sense of security......kinda like the SUV owners that drive like idiots on icy roads because they have 4WD."
46393,Steve,2007-03-13 14:36:00,2075,"charles, you were 100% correct when referring to the characteristics of a front wheel drive car.  I launched my boat with my lumina front wheel car while i watched pickup trucks with no weight in the back slide all over the place....just like you mentioned. I'm sure ANYONE on here who has launched on the NIagara River in the winter has witnessed the same....  I felt really silly after waiting half an hour for a 1500 sized pickup to get their boat outta the water, only after putting 10 guys in the back of the truck....then i would pull up in my car, get the word ""ya better be careful, you just saw what happened to me and my truck"", then pull up, drive the boat onto the trailer, and because my front wheels were on the top of the launch, above the grade, i would just drive right up....  Had i had rear wheel drive, i would have been like all the 2 wheel drive trucks, and spin my rear wheels, that were right at the water's edge....  So yes, charles, what you observed is 100% dead on."
46468,Tybo,2007-03-13 16:46:00,1373,"Yes I am a mechanic. In fact I'm a master mechanic. which is the highest license that you can get in the trade. Also have countless SAFETY certificates. I always teach SAFETY is job one. But with out communication there is no SAFETY. So if you DON'T want to listen to me thats your fault,an hopefully the people around you won't have to suffer for it.. It's nice that you did this and that and got away with it. Still doesn't make it SAFE or RIGHT.  I agree with GCD 100%.  THe fact is that most people don't use commen sence."
46591,Chris,2007-03-13 21:59:00,405,"Sorry about that Tybo, I had no idea you were a mechanic when I posted.  As I mentioned I had a car with a 1000 lb. towing capacity and the rig with equipment included weighed approx. 750 lbs. You're telling me I'm unsafe?!?!?! I guess the manufacturers rating is wrong/unsafe then too??? Can you explain how I was putting others in danger???  I don't believe I ever said it was OK to tow more than the vehicles capacity. Extra shocks and coilovers??? On a 1,000lb. rig the toungue weight should only be 100lbs. anyway you need beefed up suspension for that???  I agree 100% that most people don't use common sense.    I got passed by a guy in a F-150 towing a 14' tinny. Not only was he way over the speed limit but the back of the trailer was swaying violently from side to side all the way down the road. More than enough towing capicty, but not enough common sense to properly adjust the tongue weight and/or tire pressure and to slow down. That braking Honda you mentioned wouldn't had a chance with this clown either."
46984,Joey,2007-03-14 16:13:00,9122,..oops..  wrong log in.
46985,Tybo,2007-03-14 16:16:00,1373,The GVWR is a government rating on the vehicle not the manufactures.  For every pound you put in or on the tow vehicle you lose in tow capacity.  100lb tongue weight. the wife 120lbs. the two kids 140lbs and what ever else you stuff in there.  looks to me that your over.  HAVE A NICE DAY.
46994,PERCHER,2007-03-14 16:47:00,787,
45701,express168,2007-03-11 14:17:00,327,"Don't forget , on the extreme end of things that if you are involved in an accident and injure somebody and it is determined you were overweight you can be charged under the Highway Traffic Act and they will have a hey day when they sue you for injury and damages  . Weight loads apply to our vehicles as well ,not just commercial vehicles. Like I said this is the extreme but it is another way to look at it."
45740,Garyv,2007-03-11 17:00:00,547,"Your car will pull it but the two important questions that have to be considered/answered is for how long ( especially with others in the vehicle ) and more importantly, as others have mentioned, how safe will it be with you vehicles braking system."
