46390,bbog,2007-03-13 14:31:00,665,"Hi everyone!  Been a lurker for a long time and decided to join in today. A new member of OFAH and a lover of our great Ontario outdoors. Just got into fishing in the last couple of years and want to LEARN everything I can.  A great day is time in the canoe trying to figure out where the fish are hiding and what they want!  Looking forward to continue learning from you guys and gals.  Cheers, Barn"
46398,Joey,2007-03-13 14:43:00,9122,"Welcome Barnie.  Interesting name.  Is there a story behind it?  Cheers,  Joey"
46401,douG,2007-03-13 14:46:00,2693,"Welcome, Barney.  Your handle has something to do with Freda Payne?"
46408,just2manylures,2007-03-13 14:52:00,144,Let me be amung the first to welcome you aboard to our board...hehe

46467,Roy,2007-03-13 16:43:00,13728,"I guess you don't want me shortening it to ""Barnie's band"" eh? Welcome aboard."
46511,RobHall,2007-03-13 18:35:00,261,Welcome aboard Barnie's Band of Gold.  Kick your shoes off any stay awhile.  This is a great fishing community.  FOTB 
46517,Bly,2007-03-13 18:53:00,1556,Hey Barn..welcome to the community!!  I too am curious about the name......do tell  bly
46525,bbog,2007-03-13 19:13:00,665,"Wow it feels great to be welcomed by so many long time members.  I had no idea my choice of handle would result in such inquisitiveness. Simply, I have two Golden Retrievers. The youngest ""Barnie"" thinks he runs the show and hence we are all part of his ""band"" - the reference to ""gold"" should now be obvious.  Figured all the good handles were already taken so settled on one unlikely to be used by anyone else.  I didn't want to give myself a ""fishing"" handle and possibly set your expectations too high! But seriously, I love the great outdoors and look forward to continuing my angling education here.  Cheers Barn"
