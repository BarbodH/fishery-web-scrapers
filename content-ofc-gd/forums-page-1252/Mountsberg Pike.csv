47477,jediangler,2007-03-15 17:26:00,1923,"I haven't been there yet myself, but it should be open around the edges with all this warm weather we've been having. Let us know if you make it out for a look."
47493,Jacques,2007-03-15 17:54:00,97,Looks like Pike are closed March 31st to Second Saturday in May.  That sound about right?  I'd better dust off the daredevil and get up there soon...
