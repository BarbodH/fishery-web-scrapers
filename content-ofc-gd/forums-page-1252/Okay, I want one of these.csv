47250,irishfield,2007-03-15 01:50:00,26272,What you talkin about hot lips..... LOL
47252,Mike the Pike,2007-03-15 01:52:00,3421,Joey You would have to get it with tinted sky lights just in case Irishfield is flying close by he could take a snapshot from up above.
47254,Frankypro,2007-03-15 01:54:00,63,That's cool!  I wouldn't want to be the one carrying the 5 gal. water bag though. On their campsite it look like uphill from everywhere.
47256,pikehunter,2007-03-15 01:57:00,1659,I wonder if they have a couple of those on the Apprentice show for the losers camping out in the back yard?
47291,Garyv,2007-03-15 03:24:00,547,"Real men don't need skylights to see what there washing!   If you do some remote camping the Zodi line has some great hot water units, wish they had them years ago.  We used to wrap copper line arount a 5 gal bucket filled with charcoal...the first blast could prove to be very warm but if you used the right low pressure pump afyte the initial warmth it was very nice to use."
47321,aplumma,2007-03-15 10:50:00,6896,What a pain that would be to clean all of the soap and stuff off of after being rolled up wet and taken home..... I am sure it would be much easier if you showered and we all promised not to look.   Art
47323,taper,2007-03-15 11:18:00,611,I promise.
47334,misfish,2007-03-15 11:47:00,29133,Is there room for 2
47346,ccmtcanada,2007-03-15 12:12:00,7971,"Umm...he said ""All the comforts of home""...I dunno what your bathroom is like, but mines a lot nicer than that...LOL"
