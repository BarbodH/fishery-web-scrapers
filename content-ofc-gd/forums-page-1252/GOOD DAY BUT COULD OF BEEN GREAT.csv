47002,PatrickGG,2007-03-14 17:15:00,562,"Nicely done CC, I drove by the old mill bridge yesterday and noticed the Humber River is still frozen over i cant wait till tribes are totally thawed out and levels drop, soon i will be out there rainbow hunting."

47037,young_one,2007-03-14 19:06:00,620,Awsome report as usual! Great Success!
47047,cheese,2007-03-14 19:39:00,27,"Awesome report! I can't wait to get out .... is it worth trying the area right where a trib dumps into the lake? I was down there today and it's flowing pretty good. I'm assuming the fish are staging at the mouth.... I know roe is your bait of choice but if I don't have any, what would you suggest? Cheers!"
47052,FishFinder,2007-03-14 19:49:00,481,"if your gonna be fishing out east grab a pack of pink worms and youre set.. if if you really want you can buy roe, kris at FOL has some good roe."
