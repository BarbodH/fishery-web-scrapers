Wondering if anyone's been to - and, more importantly, fished at - Sol Cayo Santa Maria (on Cayo Santa Maria, among Cayo Coco and the other keys).  Wife and I are heading there in a week for fun in the sun.  I've searched the forum and the net and pm'd a few veterans of the Caribbean surf and am coming up with a great fishing plan for the surf, lagoons and hopefully drifting away in a free rental kayak or something off the beach!  If anyone has any tips for this resort or this key specifically, I'd love to hear it.  Anyway, I hope to provide a great post with lots of pics when I return.  Cheers,  MOB"

WE dint try anyt fishing right at the resort so i dont know about that.. but we did have a blast on the boat...    when are ya leaving??"
237893,Master of Bait,2008-08-09 00:04:00,196,"Thanks TJ!  We're leaving a week from today.  What was your impression of the island?  I've been to Varadero once but never the cayos.  Mind if I ask the $ on the charter?  I'm on a budget and I love the DYI idea so I'll have to see how things go.  Also, is this island the type of place where you can walk down the beach from the resort to get some isolation?  I want to cast the surf but I want to steer clear of swimmers!  Are there lagoons to fish not far from the resorts?  Appreciate any feedback.  Cheers,  MOB"
237901,TJQ,2008-08-09 00:17:00,7806,"Im not sure about the lagoons, the charter was 250 1/2 day 500 full day.. you can bring 4 people to make it affordable.. and yes you can walk way down the beach!"
