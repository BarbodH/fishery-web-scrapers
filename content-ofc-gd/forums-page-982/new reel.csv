237873,douG,2008-08-08 22:33:00,2693,"Spinning reels for me is Daiwa.  Agree with DM.   On the other hand, some might suggest a round baitcasting reel, like an Abu."
237875,danbo,2008-08-08 22:46:00,2646,Daiwa 3000 for balance & line capacity.

It cost me roughly $40 to ship it to Ontario, Ca(with return shipping). I couldn't get a hold of Rockey's Tackle(authorized repairman). Tried numerous times. All in all it's a pretty descent reel just the service from Okuma is horrible. Just thought you should know that if you were looking into Okuma."
