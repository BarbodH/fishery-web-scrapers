237118,BillM,2008-08-07 00:59:00,17367,"My parents had a big bull last fall rub up against the side of their sunroom, lol.  My oldman feeds turkey in the backyard all the time.  A bear tore down the bird feeder last week, and there was also a monster doe in the backyard a few days ago.  This fall should be a lot of fun!!!  (All this up in Coldwater I might add)"
