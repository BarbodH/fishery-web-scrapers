237675,ccmtcanada,2008-08-08 13:14:00,7971, That picture was horrible!  Unfathomable!!  Unthinkable!!!  Who in their right mind has an ugly green hat like that?  Jeez....some people.

237844,Rich,2008-08-08 20:51:00,3927,"Their Bull really hits me on two levels. Number one, of course, I'm an angler. The fact that there is no stop to their stupidity really threatens my/my family's favourite pastime.  The other level is, I'm a meat cutter for a living. If they got their way, I'd be out of the job. Last I checked there's not too many vegetable cutters out there.  Animals eat each other. We are animals too. If they believe animals should be treated like us, well then I guess we should be telling those bears and fish to start a healthy vegan diet."
237869,Cookslav,2008-08-08 22:10:00,1457,"Were the hell do they get their funding? This is just shamefull, ignorant, and downright Wrong...as if the poor family hasn't had enough, now people are USEING his death to preach their own agenda...horrible"
237871,oxcowboy,2008-08-08 22:23:00,544,"i can somewhat relate to rich on this only i am a farmer who supplies the meat that he cuts.  im all for animal welfare, not animal rights.  i wish we could just load up all these wackos and ship them to some island and let them live with nature.  as a farmer we have brought countless baby calves and pigs into our home to try and give them a healthy head start.  is it because we love them well kinda, but the main reason is that a sick or injured animal doesnt pay the bills.  i have personaly gave cpr to baby animals that stopped breathing during the birthing process or fell in a creek, etc...  hell some of our show animals live a better life than alot of people.  they get two baths a day, hair is brushed and dried, fed atleast twice a day, fans or air conditioning in the summer, heat in the winter, and free health care year round, doesnt sound like too bad of a deal.  i bet alot of people in third world countries would love to have such a life.  as for pretty pamela, as far as im concerned she has become the most ignorant skank on the planet.  some of that silicone must have leaked into what little brain she had to start with.   jason"

Defending their cause and equating animal slaughter to that of beheading victim is beyond sick...  http://blog.P3TA.org/archives/2008/08/cannibalistic_a.php  I think this one may of went too far for even some of the P3TA members...  On a positive note, the paper has decided to not run the ad..  Good Fishing,  Justin"
237364,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-08-07 18:36:00,160,"I am all for stoping animal cruelty but not for P3TA's crazy talk!!! you should take a look at this http://www.fishinghurts.com/Angling.asp According to P3TA ""fish are complex and intelligent individuals"" I agree with them 100 %, thats why my tackle box is filled with different lures!"
237366,blaque,2008-08-07 18:51:00,2419, Exactly.....

237369,BillsTheBassMan,2008-08-07 18:58:00,932,"This is clearly going way too far . . . . Shock and Awe . . . nothing is sacred/untouchable.  Also, concerning P3TA and Angling, I do find something quite funny.  Many of us, myself included, are WAY more likely to help our fisheries and lookout for their future because WE ARE ANGLERS.  Three years ago, before I started fishing, I could have cared less about the health of our fisheries - nowadays I'm looking for ways to help them and insure their future.  Do I accidentally mishook the odd fish from time to time?  Yes.  Will my involvement, and the involvement of my friends, in angling eventually lead to better fisheries throughout Ontario?  I sure hope so."
237370,silveradosheriff,2008-08-07 19:02:00,1025,I've also heard that they have asked that people stop fishing docks...
237371,BITEME,2008-08-07 19:05:00,1969,what the heck!!!!!!!!!!!!
237372,JohnF,2008-08-07 19:06:00,3494, And they wonder why they're often lumped in with the lunatic fringe?  JF
237404,ecmilley,2008-08-07 20:41:00,2163,would love to catch and release a few P3TA members
237408,wolfville,2008-08-07 20:44:00,396,They are making me suffer (and most of us would agree it's a lot of pain) by trying to convince people that fishing is cruel. So their action is no different than what they are trying to stop.
237409,Billy Bob,2008-08-07 20:47:00,5865,P3TA should be rushing to this scene. http://www.buffalonews.com/home/story/409296.html

237427,danbo,2008-08-07 21:32:00,2646,Maybe anglers should carry a baseball bat with them at all times? World gets wierder by the day..
237454,Tinman,2008-08-07 22:57:00,376,The poor family!!! Very good tact on their P3TA's  part!

237538,oncogene,2008-08-08 01:25:00,154,Oh P3TA doesn't really sink to a new low...... they'r already this low! I'm pretty sure it's not the first time they do something like this.  They made similar ad with that multiply-homicide case involving women killed/buried in the pig farm or something like that.   I have a suggestion for P3TA tho.... why don't they just kill one of themselves everyday... then they can make a new ad campaign everyday! A win-win for everyone.
237542,Handlebarz,2008-08-08 01:30:00,3790,Yep I bet alot of you remember this one I dont know wh ybut I can not get the info to post the pic but here is the link to our sport. these peopel are a joke but a serious one as they have some ears way up and will try and get stuff stoped we need to fight against them.  http://api.ning.com/files/AI6av9LoAaOpvIDy...innuvg/P3TA.jpg
237569,Rizzo,2008-08-08 02:18:00,4754,how incredibly insensitive to equate this poor man's life with that of farm animal. Any sane P3TA member (there's an oxymoron for you)) would hand in their withdrawal immediately.
237599,Joey,2008-08-08 03:26:00,9122,"They just ran it on CityTV news at 11 pm.  People were pretty upset!!  Its utterly despicable, they should be ashamed.  Joey"
237674,StrealHeader,2008-08-08 13:09:00,56,"When will you understand this is exactly what the want. They may be crazy, but you didn't really think they thought this add would bring them good publicity?  Best to be ignored."
