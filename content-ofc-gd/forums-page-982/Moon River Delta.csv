I see on the website there are 2 different charts you can get from the Gov. but I dont want to buy one and have the other be more detailed.  I am planning on heading up there soon, and am going to buy the charts.  Thanks"
237546,Mr. Follow,2008-08-08 01:42:00,34,Hey mike the Charts for the Moon don't show very much. as it is all uncharted and the cottagers don't leave many marked rocks out there so be careful. Follow larger boats and go slow I hit a rock out there a few weeks ago in an area I thought I knew really well. So they can really surprise you. Good luck maybe I'll see you out there.
