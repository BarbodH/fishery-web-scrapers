237567,Leecher,2008-08-08 02:14:00,7832,Cool video and great songs Cliff    Your a natural on front stage  Thanks for sharing Leechman
237568,jwl,2008-08-08 02:16:00,1056,"that's pretty cool man, me and some of my long time jammin buddy's are just about to start setting up a few local gigs....we try to get together at least once a week if possible although sometimes hard in the summer time because of work, and well ummm fishin..but we have about 100 songs down pretty good now so I think we can play some gigs no prob..  The only thing that sucks about being the entertainment at a party though is while you are rockin out, everyone else is having a good time and drinking all the beer"

237655,ccmtcanada,2008-08-08 12:17:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  MTP - Nope...not my house...LOL.  Micropterus - I hear you on the bass.  That's what happens when there are no monitors or mixing going on.  We didn't get a real sound check outside, so that's our own fault on the sound.  jwl - Very cool!  100 songs?  Wow...that's a lot of material.  Our guys just keep their beer on their amplifiers....hehe."
