238115,Silo Buster,2008-08-09 20:01:00,81,Hey all great site  Was lurking for a while and joined a bit ago.  My son (9yo) and I do as much fishing as we can.  We are pretty pumped now cause I bought a new boat this week (08 Smokercraft Alaskan Deluxe 15ft. 20hp Merc 4stroker.)  Heading for Laniel Que. as soon as I can get away. (great area)    Cheers
