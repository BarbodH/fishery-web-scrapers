I called LeBaron and they don't have any either.  Thanks.  Also, anyone know how to do double stacker downrigger clips?  Any suggestions or tips would be appreciated.  Thanks again.  Joey"
237022,Guest gbfisher,2008-08-06 20:23:00,0,"Shortwave Marine Electronics  Write a review 113 Lakeshore Road East Mississauga, ON L5G 1E2  (905) 278-6541â€Ž   You can stack as many lines as you like with stacker clips.  Ask Short wave about stacking lines, they will help you out.  "
237046,Fisherman,2008-08-06 22:19:00,7201,"Double stackers are easy, set up your first lure down on the cannonball release, lower the cannon ball about 20', then clip the snap around the downrigger cable and clip one of the releases to the cable.  Let out about 20' of line/lure from the next rod to get stacked, clip the line into the other release, lower away to the desired depth.  Gently snug up both rods.  Good point is to point the lower rod straight back, the upper rod/lure out to the side."
237081,rhare,2008-08-06 23:42:00,387,"Buy the scotty 18"" stackers they clip on the cable with a steel clip instead of a pad like some other stackers. They have a excellent release on them and olny cost about $10. Only downfall is they can fall off if you dont stop the rigger.  I put my first rod on the inside holder(left) pointed just off stright. They stacker rod is on the right rod holder pointed out off the side. Make sure you let the line out around the first rod, not stright off the back or you will tangle.  hope that helps  Ryan"

237103,ccmtcanada,2008-08-07 00:38:00,7971," Yeah well, I have a good excuse....I've only been fishing for 2 years and never downrigging for salmon in the big lake.  Yeah, that's it....

237563,fishindevil,2008-08-08 02:12:00,6254,"Hey joey tightlines in pickering & gagnons sports in oshawa,both have lots of spin doctors,and stacker clips and lots of releases they have all you will need !!!!cheers"
237633,SlowPoke,2008-08-08 10:29:00,2984," Cliff, there's no need to lie, we were running stackers. Your lovely bride knows all about them. Pay attention!!    Joey, there are two types of stackers.  This type requires the snap to be fastened to the rigger cable and the short release fastened just below the snap to limit travel on the cable. The second release is for your line.   This type clips onto the rigger cable very easily and with a single hand. I also find that if you forget to turn off your rigger on the way up, they don't get tangled in the rigger pulley. I much prefer this style.   Stackers should be spaced apart a minimum of 10' running spoons. If you plan on running flashers, 10' may not be enough even with a tight lead from the release. If you're running a diving crankbait, be sure to run it on the lowest release and a spoon or worm harness on the stacker. -Brian"
237646,Joey,2008-08-08 12:02:00,9122,Thanks for the replies guys.  I think we got the info we needed now.  All we need is the weather to cooperate!!  Joey
237648,Greencoachdog,2008-08-08 12:05:00,8163,  Do you really want to go out there and beat up on those poor little fishies again like you did last week?   Don't forget a big straw hat for the sunburn!
237699,Joey,2008-08-08 14:23:00,9122, Yes and
237701,ccmtcanada,2008-08-08 14:26:00,7971," Hey Brian, if it didn't spill all over the floor of your boat, then I didn't get a close look at it....that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it...."
237821,Fang,2008-08-08 19:13:00,1330,good selection of SD's at JB's too
237832,Spiel,2008-08-08 20:02:00,9065," Brian's got it straight, they're my choice as well."
237838,Joey,2008-08-08 20:27:00,9122,"Okay, I just made the trip to JB's.  I called first and they were very nice and helpful.  Said they closed at 8 p.m. but if you're ever running late, just call and they'll stay open for you  They had a wall of spin doctors in every colour, quite impressive actually.  I grabbed a few, then salivated over the musky lures, then left.  Traffic sucked.  Paul has figured out the stacking thing.  Thanks again all.  Joey"
238045,LeXXington,2008-08-09 13:43:00,1928,"Go get them Joey\Paul.  I only run stackers when I really have too, I prefer to run the dipseys out with my hand cranks stackers are lots of work"
238048,Greencoachdog,2008-08-09 14:08:00,8163,  I feel sorry for those poor little Atlantic Salmoons today!!!
