236828,Tinman,2008-08-06 03:02:00,376,"So we got out on Monday with the kids. We met up with their grandpa and Uncle Dave on the boat at Black Rapid Locks. The weather turned out great!      We decided that we would go down to Hurst Marina and fuel up then head to Kelley's to get fed and on to fishing!! Along the way we saw plenty of great houses.      And some really cool boats.      This last one was full of old people on tour, they were cleaning it when we got there.   I asked my daughter what she thought of the scenery and this is what i got in return   So we looked on the fishfinder for some spots and I asked Cole what his opinion of the spot was.   We finally found a spot to fish.        and my proud moment, Thea finally lipping a bass!   We headed back as we were all tired and ready to head home     All and all a great day on the water!!!  Denis"
