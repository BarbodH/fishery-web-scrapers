I have a plastic tackle box screwed to the top of one of my coolers that holds at least 8 bouncers in their collapsed storage condition, in its larger open tray area, 2 or 3 of each, 1/2 oz, 3/4 oz, and 1 oz, along with 2 homemade small marker floats on top of them.  I am mostly a day-tripper, gotta use space to a premium."
