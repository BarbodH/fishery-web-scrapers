237726,Aspano,2008-08-08 15:24:00,13,We went out over the long weekend just passed on the Niagara - caught us a boatful o bass! TUBES RULE!  
224546,rhare,2008-07-07 21:50:00,387,"I spent this weekend down in Niagara falls fishing the river. The weather was nothing less then beautiful and the fishing was GREAT!!  If you have never fished the Niagara before add it to your list of to dos what a incredible body of water. Tons of scrappy fish, wicked scenery and lots of water to fish. Even just hiking around the river is a real blast. now to the fishing.   We started on Saturday morning bright and early by hiking along the river and fishing some backwater eddies. The bass where very co operative. we used tubes and must have landed 60+ bass. Nothing overly Hugh but all super scrappy.     I was working my tube in a big school of bait when I was pounded I knew right away it was no bass, maybe a laker?? Nope a nice July steelhead in awesome shape. What a fight it must have jumped 6 times. The first steel I have ever caught in July. and the first one on a white tube.    Sunday Morning we headed out with Paul Castellano of Cast Adventures. We started working over some shallow water bass areas but the chop on the water was making the topwater bite tough so we decided to go bounce some walleyes before the sun got too high. The eyes where on. In just over a hour we boated 4 eyes in the 4lbs range and lost 3 more fish. The first 3 drifts produced fish!! The best coming in at 23"" a new PB for me in my young walleye career.   From there we decided to move on a fish for some more bass. This is where paul introduced us to Strike Zone Slammers drop shot  bait. I had seen some of the Mark's stuff on line but never had a chance to get my hands on it. WHAT A BAIT!! If you don't have any get some in your box. In about 30min the 3 of us landed over 30 bass on slammers in various colors including a back to back pair of 20"" tanks  I landed in a 50 yard section of shore. It was crazy. My buddy started with a tube and got nothing well Paul and I smashed bass on slammer a quick switch and he was killing em too.  At the end of the day we had landed well over 60 bass, and that was a tough bite!!! Hats off to Cast Adventures for making another weekend to remember. http://www.castadventures.ca http://www.strikezonetournamentbaits.com       tightlines  Ryan"
