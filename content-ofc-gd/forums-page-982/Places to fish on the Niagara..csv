237885,jrego7,2008-08-08 23:44:00,37,I've been reading here for a few days now and decided to join the community here at OFC. I'm thinking about fishing Niagara tomorrow offshore. So far I hear the whirlpool produces good fishing. I'm not to familiar with the area or where the exact path is that leads you to the whirlpool. My gps will take me there!  I would appreciate any input anyone has to give like other good spots or the path entrance.
