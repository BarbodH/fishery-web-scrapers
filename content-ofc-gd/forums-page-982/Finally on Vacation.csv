237966,Mike the Pike,2008-08-09 03:20:00,3421,Well the time has finally come I am leaving in the morning first week I will be Camping at Rideau River Provincial Park.  I will be doing lots of shore fishing and some fishing from my canoe.  The 2nd week I will be visiting my mom in the Northbay area and wow do I have my choice of lakes up there I will have the boat the 2nd week .I should have some reports about how junior out fished me again  Not sure about this wet weather does not look promising looks like a wet week ahead.  The rain won't bother me but the Mosquitos are out of control this year.  Just packing up the tent trailer tonight almost a dozen bites.Oh well I will make the best of it.  Be back in 2 weeks with hopefully some nice fish to report.  Wow this means I won't be tormented from a redneck for 2 weeks now that will be relaxing.  I will miss ya all be back in 2 weeks.
