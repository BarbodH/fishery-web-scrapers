237412,silvio,2008-08-07 20:50:00,433,I have a chance to grab one of these thinking about using it as a salmon float reel. Has anyone ever used one? How are they? Thank you

I sold it a couple years ago - in MINT condition - for much less than the one you are looking at.  With a little more money you could pick up a brand new Islander or since you are looking at a Chinny outfit it might serve you well to look at a 5"" like a Raven Matrix.  Just my opinion though!!!  Good luck,  Harv"
