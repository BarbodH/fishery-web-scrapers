237664,JohnF,2008-08-08 12:48:00,3494,I'd sure want to know what the fine print says on that policy and just what part of my driving habits this thingy records. What if it absolves the company of responsibility if I've ever exceeded the speed limit or something like that. I doubt there's a driver alive who hasn't lit it up a little at least once.  On the other hand it may just be a scrutiny that only someone who's a relatively safe driver would be willing to subject themselves to and the company is playing the percentages that since you believe you're a careful driver then you probably are. Kinda like the no-smoker clause in life insurance.  JF

Drive like an   then you should pay more. I've got about 38 years of driving with no tickets, one crash attributed to a Villeneuve driver from PQ and I drive defensively.  See a stop sign, may as well slow down, stale green, why waste gas to speed up to try and beat it, etc. Up to 60% off is a pretty good incentive."

Of course then there comes a turnaround point when the motor skills and vision deteriorate and then you get a driver like the little old lady I followed just now. She really has no business being out on the road IMNSHO. I wonder if a car monitor would point out her shortcomings as a driver.  JF"
