237669,Seaweed,2008-08-08 12:55:00,135,Just got home from up that way.  We got five good days up there without rain.  The rain started yesterday and is expected to carry on for a few days so we headed home a bit early.  Ran into WVmedic and said hello.  Overall the bite was slow.  We managed to catch a few walleye and a buddy of mine got in to some smallies drop-shotting some rocky points.  The water level was amazingly high.  I guess that would help explain the slow bite.  Good luck and looking forward to your report.
238046,wvmedic,2008-08-09 13:45:00,144,"As seaweed said the bite was slow, had to work for the ones we caught but we did manage some decent walleyes, a few pike on the troll and some good smallies, a bunch of rock bass, red ear and perch with a few being jumbo. No one in camp was catching good numbers and two couples had been there for a month, but the atmosphere is great and the entire staff at Lake Air is wonderful.    Hey Seaweed, it was nice seeing you. We headed home Thursday eve a couple hours after you passed us just out from Memquisit Lodge.  Jeff."
