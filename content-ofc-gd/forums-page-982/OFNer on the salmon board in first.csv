237587,ccmtcanada,2008-08-08 03:01:00,7971,One more day Dan!  We're all pulling for you!
237597,jwl,2008-08-08 03:20:00,1056,right on man
237649,fisher,2008-08-08 12:07:00,451,"After you take first prize   (since today is going to be rough out there and likely not many will venture out - including me), would you mind telling your fellow OFNers details on the catch (depth of water, depth of lure, etc..).  If not, I understand but I am hoping to catch you in an extremely happy state of mind   - after all a Brand NEW $30,000 Lund/Trailer package doesn't come along every day.  This year has been pretty good for my dad, 5 year old son and I with many 20-25# fish caught but we just can't seem to zero in on anything much bigger.  Anyway, good luck and I am rooting for you."
