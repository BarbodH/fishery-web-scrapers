237601,Jen,2008-08-08 03:43:00,833,"Thank you to Sonny for taking us out on his wonderful boat to do some salmon fishing out from Fishermans Pier... It was a beautiful night with only a few hours to fish.  We were using dipsy's riggers and lead core and in the short time we were out did rather well.  Here is our catch.      I thought we might be able to weigh them in for the Salmon Tournament but they just didn't make the grade at 22lbs and under... All fish heading for the smoker with Sonny's from last night.  Again thanks for taking me out... these are fish of a lifetime for me and it was greatly appreciated!  Cheers,  Jen"

237717,Jen,2008-08-08 14:54:00,833," As far as I know from all my time studying what kinds of fish are out in Lake Ontario I have never caught an Atlantic Salmon...  These fish are Chinook Salmon which would be Pacific Salmon.  Thanks for the compliment... I was thrilled...  Cheers,  Jen"
