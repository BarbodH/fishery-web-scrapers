This morning on the Interstate, I looked over to my left and there was a Woman  In a brand new Cadillac    Doing 65 mph    With her Face up next to her  Rear view mirror  Putting on her eyeliner.  I looked away   For a couple seconds !  And when I looked back she was  Halfway over in my lane,    Still working on that makeup.    As a man,  I don't scare easily.    But she scared me so much;  I dropped  My electric shaver ,  Which knocked  The donut  Out of my other hand.  In all  The confusion of trying To straighten out the car    Using my knees against The steering wheel,    It knocked   My cell phone  Away from my ear    Which fell    Into the coffee  Between my legs,    Splashed,    And burned    Big Dan and the Twins,    Ruined the darn phone,    Soaked my trousers,    And disconnected an Important call.    Stupid women drivers"
