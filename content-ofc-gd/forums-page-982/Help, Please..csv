236952,Tybo,2008-08-06 16:52:00,1373,"The knot I use is not recommended for over 15lbs. I still use it for 20 to 30lbs, but was thinking of changing before my luck runs out.  So the question is what type of knot do you recommend to use on 20lbs plus mono and floro.  Thanks."
236955,Raf,2008-08-06 16:54:00,3495,i use the uni for anything and everything  with thick diameter mono/fluoro you won't need the 8 or 9 wraps as you do with braid.  5-7 will be fine.
236960,BillM,2008-08-06 16:57:00,17367,"I like the Trilene for mono (stream fishing, I can do it quickly, lol) and the Uni for everything else."
236963,highdrifter,2008-08-06 17:10:00,2534,"clinch. or trilene not I think.  A uni is also a good knot.  A clinch can be improved or not, depending on the application.  Improving a clinch may make it a little bulkier though, but I'm told it's safer.  And like Raf mentioned, 5 wraps outta do it.  cheers HD"
236965,danbo,2008-08-06 17:18:00,2646,Trilene..
236971,cpguy29,2008-08-06 17:22:00,148,Uni and sometimes Trilene knot.
236973,danbo,2008-08-06 17:25:00,2646,ALWAYS TRI-LENE !
236979,Raf,2008-08-06 17:33:00,3495,the panty knot... apparently... always.
236982,John,2008-08-06 17:38:00,2956," We call 'em knickers Raf, the knots are the same though!........."

237006,douG,2008-08-06 19:27:00,2693,"Paul, what type of knot are you looking for?  Are you tying to a ring, eye or swivel, or joining two lines together?"
237017,Whopper,2008-08-06 20:05:00,2174,  Doug maybe he's tying up the Mrs Slip knot for sure
237027,Wild,2008-08-06 20:34:00,704,"I use the bowline, knut, fisherman's knot, and a few more, most are good for lines 10,000 or more. "
237069,BillM,2008-08-06 23:19:00,17367,Forgot to mention the palomar.
237079,Dave Bailey,2008-08-06 23:39:00,1641,"Beat me to it, excellent knot and easy to tie."
237777,Tybo,2008-08-08 17:14:00,1373," Use the half hitch for the wife.Doesn't madder how mush she struggles, they wouldn't tighten and cut off circulation.  Thanks for the replies.  Doug, I will be mostly tying to snap swivels. pretied leaders."
237820,douG,2008-08-08 19:11:00,2693,"Give the palomar a try, Paul."
237827,Leecher,2008-08-08 19:27:00,7832,I'd go with uni or trilene....both are real strong knots and won't slip Leechman
