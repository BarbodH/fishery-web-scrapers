236701,forrest,2008-08-05 22:25:00,1032,"How big is that largie?  Judging by the colour of your GF sweater: Its chartreuse big.  that is bigger than pink big, but, smaller than polka dot big.  I have mentioned measuring by water displacement before....how much did the lake go down when you pulled out the fish?  forrest"
236709,Pigeontroller,2008-08-05 22:54:00,2793,You guys are all nuts! There's no way that Bass is 6 pounds!!!!   Its 10 for sure!!!  Nice to see you posting Bill.
236712,Canuck2fan,2008-08-05 23:05:00,1444,Awesome fish and definitely + six lbs on her fish. It looks like that bass has had the fall feedbag on for about 2 yrs solid LOL
236714,figureight,2008-08-05 23:08:00,40,"Nice bass, congrats. Got to love those topraiders"
236745,fishindevil,2008-08-06 00:10:00,6254,"Big Buckets for sure !!!!  ,great pics too congrats !!!!....cheers"
236835,ehg,2008-08-06 03:37:00,2666,"There seems to be alot of big bass caught the last few days....wow  Sometimes i've spoken of that bass your brother caught if folks are talking of big bass in Ontario.  Your girlfriend caught caught a huge one there, looks over 6 lbs. Nice going there Bill!"
236837,Tinman,2008-08-06 03:47:00,376,i never ask a girl ANY weight! lol
236911,Rattletrap2,2008-08-06 13:46:00,1652,"Bill, those are some sweet looking hawgs for sure!  I would be very careful to articulate my words when telling this story...especially when your girlfriend is within earshot! The words ""my girlfriends BIG BASS"" sound awfully close to ""my girlfriends BIG ASS""!! Say it slowly and clearly! LOL"
236987,Cudz,2008-08-06 17:59:00,2652,That is over 7.
237000,manoman,2008-08-06 18:55:00,3,WE need more ladies to fish THIS IS NOT FAR.
237076,MuskyBill,2008-08-06 23:36:00,311,"Thanks all, she's still pretty stoked & looking forward to getting her next crack at a bigger one.  I think we're gonna call it an honest 6 lb'er. I personally don't think it was an oz under 6, but without knowing what it really was, neither one of us is willing to throw around numbers like 6.5 or 7.  Might make a nice replica....."
237082,Greencoachdog,2008-08-06 23:44:00,8163," I wouldn't hesitate to go the 6 1/2 or 7 Bill...   heck! you released it and it's still growing eh!!!  next time get a length and girth, it'll give you a little more to work with when guesstimating of for the replica!   ... and like Fidel said, good to see a post from you on the board Bubba!"
237087,mepps,2008-08-06 23:54:00,1301,"Beauty bass, gotta be pushin 7!"
238047,wvmedic,2008-08-09 13:49:00,144,Holly cow what a hog!!!  Congrats to your girlfriend.
236344,MuskyBill,2008-08-05 08:47:00,311,"Here's two recent Largies that were weighed...  Scott's 5.1 lb'er...    Garry's 5.5 lb'er...    Being the Musky folk that we are, we only measured this bucket she got on a Topraider on Sunday night. It came in at 21.5"", but was pretty heavy. I told her it was at least 5 lbs., but maybe the Bass experts here on OFC could give us a better idea.  So, how heavy was this Largie?      She just bested her PB by half an inch, after last years 21""er...  "
236345,MuskyBill,2008-08-05 08:54:00,311,Another one that was weighed on a digi scale was Mike's 7 lb 11 oz monster from a couple years ago.  
236347,Roy,2008-08-05 09:22:00,13728,"Bill, I'm certainly no expert but that's gotta be a 6+ fer sure. Mayonnaise a lotta meat on that fish! Wow! Impressive to say the least! Congrats to your sweetie."
236349,Roy,2008-08-05 09:27:00,13728,And Mike's bucket is just a beast. Not many of us will ever even see one that big close up. Good on ya Mike.
236363,Greencoachdog,2008-08-05 10:40:00,8163,"That's a hog Bass for sure Bill, I say 6 1/2-7 lbs. Congrats to your gal on besting her PB!!!"
236364,Whopper,2008-08-05 10:43:00,2174,Bill from where I sit that LM is well over six pounds. Congrats to your gal that's a nice fish
236365,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-08-05 10:49:00,1362,Congrats.....that is one BIG BASS!!!!
236366,cpguy29,2008-08-05 10:54:00,148,Gotsta be a 6lber or more. NICE!
236376,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-05 11:15:00,2585,yeah i was thinking around 6 as well.  nice fish no matter what she weighed!  cheers!
236378,bushart,2008-08-05 11:18:00,2628,"I've been married long enough too avoid answering the question....  ""Does this lure make my bass look Big?""  There is no safe answer.  Nice fish though  Bushart"
236394,ccmtcanada,2008-08-05 11:50:00,7971,"When I first opened this thread up and saw a picture of Scott, I almost choked on my coffee.  Thought he was your girlfriend....LOL.  As far as your g/f's bass....what an awesome catch!! I have no idea how big it is...only that it could eat my personal best bass for breakfast.  It's girth is so impressive, it may have done just that...LOL.  Congrats all around!"
236403,b2kptbo,2008-08-05 12:06:00,1505,"Doesn't matter bout the weight, cause it's Lunger 4 sure, she did good..."
236429,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-05 12:43:00,0,6+ and the last one is about 5 lbs. That is the third 6+lb bass I have seen from Scugog. Like I said. There are some big bass in the bog.  How is the Musky fishing on the bog anyways? Haven't seen too many big ones pulled out this year.
236488,mattyk,2008-08-05 14:31:00,2110,thats one beast of a hawg bass! Great catch and thanks for sharing!
236489,BillM,2008-08-05 14:31:00,17367,"That thing is a monster!  Although if you read the thread title quickly, you might be expecting a different kind of picture  :)"
236492,Rizzo,2008-08-05 14:43:00,4754,"Holy smokes what a bass! Looks like it swallowed an anchor. No guess on the weight, never weighed one that big"
236505,highdrifter,2008-08-05 15:10:00,2534,"Right on Bill, your girlfriend's fish is a hog!  Mike's fish is bigger, but he's not as pretty.  I remember John and I working the spot in that shot, but we somehow got distracted and you guys mozied on over and pulled out 2 beauties, one of them the largest buckets I'd ever seen! LOL  Good to have a post from you.  Hope all is well.  HD"
236541,DANIMAL,2008-08-05 16:34:00,215,"Looks like an 8+ in the picture, but pictures can be decieving. A 21.5'' with that build is probably 6-6.5 lbs. Beuty fish for sure."
236545,Leecher,2008-08-05 16:45:00,7832,It sure is a beast    Congrats to your GF for her PB  I'm not going to guess that one because ain't an expert but appreciate you share the pics with us.  Again great job Leechman
236547,solopaddler,2008-08-05 16:49:00,8605,"That is one huge bass, wow!"
236567,MuskyBill,2008-08-05 17:39:00,311,"Great guesses, guys, she'll be tickled to hear!  JohnnyBass, great guess with The Bog, but t'werent The Bog this time. Close though.  Goose Bay, Sturgeon Lake.  The Bog's too tough to fish at night by this time of year, what with all of the floating weed mats & such. In June, you can cast & hear a 'splash', but by mid-July you only hear a 'splat'."
236574,ecmilley,2008-08-05 17:49:00,2163,"nice bass Bill, pigs by anyone's standards"
236587,Reef Runner,2008-08-05 18:08:00,980,"Geez Louize that's a massive bass, 6+lbs and two thumbs up for getting it on a topraider, wow.  Congrats, that is very impressive.  Thanks for sharing that."
236596,mikeh,2008-08-05 18:27:00,824,"congrats, I'd say it's 6 lbs even , wow what a fish ."
236693,Clampet,2008-08-05 22:00:00,1947,  Yep.
