What we are looking for is a 3 day, 2 night trip, mainly canoing with some portaging ( nothing crazy like 50 km's portaging ) somewhere within 3 hours of Toronto.  Anyone have anything to recommend?  Thanks"

Pick up a copy of Kevin Callan's Cottage country canoe routes, filled with good trips like the afore mentioned one."
238145,JerseyDog,2008-08-09 21:54:00,190,Kevin Callan' s books are good.  Try the McRae/McDonald/Gibson loops for an easy trip.

238170,bow slayer,2008-08-09 23:40:00,1074,check out the Restoule river one. Runs into the French River. Great route takes about 3-4 days.Good fishing.

Its considered by many to be the most beautiful lake in Algonquin, is a relatively short (part day) canoe-in from the access point which also sees less traffic than others.   One of the best parts -- aside from the fantastic lake trout fishing there's a population of fast-growing pike moving through that lake system (likely from feeding on the lakers).    Also smallmouth, and short day trips to speck lakes."
