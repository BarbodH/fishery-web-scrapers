237647,Cudz,2008-08-08 12:05:00,2652,I will be in Toronto on Wednesday and again on Thursday.  Both days I have 3 hours of spare time to fish.  I have crossed over several rivers and was wondering if they hold any fish other than the salmon/trout runs?  Can anyone recommend a pier or river that won't cost me $$$$ to park near?  I am willing to go anywhere in Toronto/Mississauga/Scorborough.  Thanks

237780,Cudz,2008-08-08 17:20:00,2652,I can go to the credit river.  Is there parking? What am I fishing for?
237793,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-08 17:35:00,0,Nothing really good to fish. Early season pike but thats about it. They say the credit has smallies up river and some largies. Pretty soon the Salmon will be coming in.  There's also Humber river at old mill.  I personally wouldn't waste my time unless the Salmon are in or if you like carp fishing.
