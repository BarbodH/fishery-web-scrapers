671372,kickingfrog,2012-02-29 17:26:00,8333,Thanks for the video. Makes you wonder why they bother with a 4 inch bait doesn't it?  Link works but you have to copy and paste it.
671375,irishfield,2012-02-29 17:31:00,26272,"  ..and people laugh at me fishing Lakers with a 10"" musky tube!"
671379,NAW,2012-02-29 17:33:00,4022,That's cool to see.  Thanks for posting that.  What did you do with the herring?  Toss it back down the hole I'm assuming.
671383,Spiel,2012-02-29 17:35:00,9065,"Back in the late 70's and early 80's when Herring were still fairly abundant in Simcoe my go to lure for ice fishing was the 6"" Williams Whitefish, no doubt it'll become a hot lure again with the Herring population bouncing back.  (Link fixed)"
671389,BillM,2012-02-29 17:38:00,17367,Steve robbed that poor fella of a nice meal!  LOL
671395,kickingfrog,2012-02-29 17:43:00,8333," Oh Wayne, it has nothing to do with your lure."
671429,4x4bassin,2012-02-29 18:23:00,1025,"Great video as always Steve and I have seen that too but it was another lake trout in its gullet , those things are pigs !"
671465,Joey,2012-02-29 19:18:00,9122,Great video.  Poor thing got it's meal taken tho  Can't believe the size of the herring
671540,Rod Caster,2012-02-29 21:54:00,5784,"Like stealing candy from a baby, eh Steve? hahaha.  Great video! I had some frozen fallfish around that same size, I was sure they would work...but as it turns out, location is just as important as bait. After seeing this video, I might do some creek brookies a favor and catch some oversized fallfish again this summer and freeze them for bait.  "
671550,Nipfisher,2012-02-29 22:09:00,2449,Cool video.
671741,steverowbotham,2012-03-01 08:25:00,1800,Of course.  Thanks for the views everyone. Was an interesting catch for sure!
