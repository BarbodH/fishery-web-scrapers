671039,cjgraham,2012-02-29 00:36:00,104,Absolutely brutal. I'm not sure I can stay a Leafs fan for much longer
671045,blaque,2012-02-29 00:50:00,2419,"I'm not a leafs fan ""persay"".......but I do root for them to be better as I believe they make the league more fun to watch when they are in the mix"
671046,blaque,2012-02-29 00:54:00,2419,"Ideally I'd like my Sabres, and the leafs back in the top 5 in the conference. Oh and bring back the nordiques and put all three back into a competitive mode and I'd be one happy hockey fan"
671062,BillM,2012-02-29 01:35:00,17367,"I'm not surprised to see a 2-0 or 3-0 in the first period anymore.. I actually kind of expect it, lol!"
