671414,d_paluch,2012-02-29 18:02:00,343,"I am a die hard leaf fan, but lets be realistic.  They suck! They've proven this year (at times) that they can contend...but somethings just not working. Penalty kill is finally doing well, but right when that happens the team falls apart, go figure! Goaltending...I don't even need to touch that subject.  All this hate on Alfie. I hate him, but only for that dirty hit on Tucker in the playoffs and same shift scores the game winner. You can't say hes not a good player. He may not have won any meaningful awards other than the Calder, but hes been consistent. Hate to say it but the Sens are just a better team.  Now, if we were to swap coaches...that could be a different story  There is no other team in the league that can go on such a slide when it counts and keep their head coach. I am not saying its Wilsons fault, but is it ever solely the coaches fault? Look at the majority of the teams out there who've fired their coaches this year. It is never solely the coaches fault, but the firing of a coach can really change a teams demeanor (didn't work for the Habs though )  All in all I still feel the leafs can make the playoffs this year. They just can't afford to lose many more games (obviously). I will guarantee that the Sens will have at least one more breakdown this year, lose a bunch in a row, they key is the leafs need to start a winning streak of their own.   Is it sad that I still have so much faith in the team? lol"
671415,d_paluch,2012-02-29 18:03:00,343,and Phaneuf is better than Alfie solely on Elisha Cuthbert
671417,d_paluch,2012-02-29 18:05:00,343, Did he hold it up high and kiss it?
671422,Chance,2012-02-29 18:11:00,420," I dont hate him I think he is a good player just not an amazing player.Malkin is amazing,Lidstrom amazing.I aslo happen to think Phaneuf is a waste of a C so I am realistic."
671424,Oggie,2012-02-29 18:12:00,588,Geez i hate when i agree with  a sens fan! Dan o.
671425,muskymatt,2012-02-29 18:14:00,2608, TSN Kipreos ex laff
671427,muskymatt,2012-02-29 18:17:00,2608,Actually it's more like flies on .....well you know!!!  Bahahaha
671431,Chance,2012-02-29 18:23:00,420,  There are these channels on TV that talk about all current events .They are called News channels.Each locale usually has their own that focuses on local events.TSN is not a news channel is a Sports channel. Maybe thats the issue you are having ?
671432,Chance,2012-02-29 18:25:00,420,  So first you admit its all about the Leafs.Then state Leaf fans are dedicated.Then finish it off with Sens fans are just a bunch of flies.Boy cant argue with that train of thought.
671433,bushart,2012-02-29 18:28:00,2628,  A smart hockey analyst would compare them straight up  Sens been back 20 years in the modern era one final appearance and a president's trophy  Leafs last 20 years (to equal Sens franchise time )  Accomplished??  Beat the sens a couple rounds & ???? kept a team out of Hamilton for fear of being shown up by another Ontario franchise.  Yes another successful comparison
671435,Oggie,2012-02-29 18:29:00,588,Dead on! Wilson shows NO emotion at any time and its reflected in his players. THEY AREN'T READY TO PLAY! They're down by two goals every game then  they try to play catchup. Game preparation is Wilson's job. Fire him! Dan o.
671436,muskymatt,2012-02-29 18:30:00,2608,"No, it was stated sens fans were like moths to a flame for following the laffs demise. I simply corrected the analogy as being more like flies on crap."
671439,Chance,2012-02-29 18:34:00,420,  So you are saying neither has accomplished much in the last 20 years.You either win the cup or you dont.
671441,Chance,2012-02-29 18:36:00,420,  Mmmhhhmmm as you said sens fans are a bunch of flies attracted to schizen...carry on .
671442,Chance,2012-02-29 18:38:00,420,  Should of been gone before this.Kind of like closing the barn door when the horses are already gone.The new coach will need to be a miracle worker.
671444,Oggie,2012-02-29 18:44:00,588,Anybody see the exchange between Kypreos and doug mclean last night. I think kypreos was implying the Leafs roll there eyes when Wilson talks. Mclean said then its time the coach goes or the offending player goes. Time to open that final envelope Ron! (Old coaching joke) dan o.
671446,Chance,2012-02-29 18:46:00,420,  Couldnt agree more and if I were a bettin man my odds would be on Phaneuf and Wilson at odds.
671448,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-29 18:55:00,0,what an organization!
671531,muskymatt,2012-02-29 21:32:00,2608," Hockey news update on a sport channel, whatever   :blahblah1:"
671561,Chance,2012-02-29 22:31:00,420, TSN... CNN yeah whats the difference.
671160,BillM,2012-02-29 04:42:00,17367,Wilson could have used a bit more emotion during that post game interview.
671260,Chance,2012-02-29 14:35:00,420," Excellent ,good for him,nice to see a young guy with a good start. Reimer made out very well in his debut into the league also. See,point being you are under the misconception that I said the Sens had no farm system. When in fact I simply asked a question.Why with such a system ""teeming with talent"" to use your words could they possibly be at the bottom of their division in the A while a team who's ""cupboards are bare"" to once again use your words, be at the top of theirs.I do not deny they have talent in their system but to put them atop of mount olympus and place the Leafs in the valley of the damned is delusional. Then again that is standard fare for leaf bashers.Beat the Kessel trade to death etc etc etc....  You are drawn to the Leafs like moths to a porch light and it irritates you but still you focus daily on them.Remind me who the sheep are again ."
671264,BillM,2012-02-29 14:40:00,17367,I think Doc is taking out his frustrations on the Leafs because his beloved Sault Greyhounds are cleaning up the basement in the OHL
671267,craigdritchie,2012-02-29 14:43:00,1586,"Back in September I said the Loafs would - once again - not make the playoffs, but would finish high enough to keep from getting a decent draft pick.  Nice to see they're right on track."
671276,Chance,2012-02-29 14:53:00,420,Would of been nice to see them do better but as yourself was waiting for the 9th or 10 th spot again. Always next year
671292,Chance,2012-02-29 15:36:00,420,"  No he wont...moths to the flame, moths to the flame my friend"
671324,[email protected],2012-02-29 16:33:00,119,"no matter the end result this season, the Leafs ARE Canada's team.  I don't recall ever hearing ""go senoritas go"" in LA, Minny, Tampa, etc..... but GO LEAFS GO reverberates throughout the arenas around the NHL. Ottawa fan, I'll explain the ""big"" word to you, if you need. Hahaha Senoritas, even in your home rink, KRUSTY gets booed. LOLOL"
671351,Chance,2012-02-29 16:57:00,420,"  Oh I admit it and have so for many years but that wont change a thing.I just get a kick out of the sheeple who when their team of choice are a few points ahead dont take time to rejoice, they get drawn back to the Leafs. They all seem to know what the GM is thinking,what he should do differently on and on and on.Same old drivel they are being fed by the media.Many NHL teams wish they had the following the Leafs have.Go to a Sens home game and listen to the chants of ""go Leafs go"" eclipse any attempt at a rally cheer by the couple of Sens fans. Hey it is tough for others to admit but Toronto win or lose IS the center of hockey in Canada. Get over it Sens fans,you will always be second to the Leafs in stature. This time last year it was the Habs fans leaf bashing yet this year que the crickets."
671363,muskymatt,2012-02-29 17:15:00,2608,"If I could correct your assumption. It's not that the Sens (PRAISE ALFIE) are 11 points ahead of the laffs, it's all about the lack of points the laffs have and how bad they suck! I think the laff fans should be commended for their wide spread dedication of a team that consistently sucks soooo bad they can't make the playoffs and haven't won a cup for over 40 years and it doesn't look bright for the future. Now as far as booing a player from another team in his own rink, I guess if you have no team priorities and have nothing to cheer about in your own rink, they do what you have to. Quite frankly, I don't think the laff fans know how to cheer no matter what rink they are in. They certainly don't cheer at the acc  Bahahahahah"
671366,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-29 17:19:00,2690,Things better turn around real quick.  Here's a look at the standings from 9th to the basement.

671374,muskymatt,2012-02-29 17:27:00,2608,"And that in itself is sad. For a country that prides itself on hockey, calls it our national sport, and has 2 of the most storied clubs in the league. To have faltered so bad, is a shame. It's embarrassing!"
671378,[email protected],2012-02-29 17:32:00,119,"why praise alfie??????? what has he EVER done???? multiple cup wins, or even one.....no won an MVP award......................no won scoring title(s).......................no respected by other players..........no headed to Hall of Fame......... HAHA thouroughly dominated by Leafs in playoffs....................YYYYYUUUPPP ya, praise KRUSTY,  LOLOLOLOL"
671381,Chance,2012-02-29 17:34:00,420," So to summarize your post,its not about the Sens its all about the Leafs.Leaf fans are dedicated.Now your getting it ! How would you know what Leaf fans do at the ACC you couldnt get a ticket, all sold out !!"

671397,muskymatt,2012-02-29 17:45:00,2608,"Damn, I've been figured out!!!  LoL  How do I know what happens at the ACC you ask???  Because the laffs sucking dominates the news, it's all they talk about. It's almost better than watching the game itself!! There could be a 20 game home win record going on and the laffs sucking would take precedence!  Oh wait, there was!!!  Bahahahahaa"
671398,Lip-ripper,2012-02-29 17:45:00,228,"I'm not an Alfredsson fan, just decided to do a quick wikipedia search to see.  I'd give credit for the Calder trophy for Top NHL rookie though, that's impressive.  p.s Last Leafs Calder trophy winner? Brit Selby in 65-66"

671407,bushart,2012-02-29 17:52:00,2628,"Maybe--Captain of an eastern Canadian team to make the finals within recent memory or winner of Presidents trophy  Who was the leaf captain in 1967---the last time they made the finals  aka 45 years ago or 2.25x the years the Sens have been playing in the modern era  Springsteen sings it---""Glory days....they'll pass ya by...""   Would'nt bring up the obvious but the dedication is gettin kind of deep--soon in need of a shovel."

Clearly wilson wanted a goalie at the deadline from what he said at the post game. The d sucked pretty bad. Unfortunatly the caps won as well."

671100,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-29 03:00:00,10439,  They don't need a goalie or D'men or forwards. They need a good SPORTS PSYCOLOGIST!!!!!!!

670942,BillM,2012-02-28 21:05:00,17367,Rangers have had it dialed in for a while now..  Wouldn't be surprised if they made it a long way in the playoffs.
670943,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 21:06:00,0,  MLSE would never hire a sens fan.  we have higher expectations of our teams.
670946,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 21:09:00,0, we have an excellent farm system.  that includes the guys playing in sweden and the canadian hockey league.  keep swinging!
670951,bushart,2012-02-28 21:25:00,2628,I believe that kid that won it all for the Swedish jrs at Christmas is a Senator from the last draft
670975,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 22:20:00,8333,Two prime examples of Einstein's definition of insanity:   Sens fans thinking they'll win a play-off round against the Leafs.   Leafs fans explaining life long loyalty to a sens fan.   Fanatics we be.
671005,Chance,2012-02-28 23:21:00,420,"  Given the current discussion that statement cant possibly make sense to you,does it?  I will gladly swing once you pitch something of substance."
670822,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 16:54:00,0, I believe Lupul is a hell of a hockey player and would be a 2nd line player on a championship team.  phil kessel is a floater.  if you want a floater on your top line be my guest!
670823,Chance,2012-02-28 16:55:00,420,"  Rebuild,great catch phrase,unfortunately every year is a rebuild. As far as jealousy goes why would I be jealous of a sports team,strange.  Factor in that the team you choose to rant about has a farm team currently at the bottom of their division while the Marlies sit stop of theirs.Funny how the Leafs have nothing in their system yet two senator scouts were at the last three Marlie home games before the trade deadline."
670824,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-28 16:55:00,10439," And that would mean a lot if the playoffs were now and not two months from now. Right now it means absolutly BUPKISS!!!!   :tease: Heck, by next week the two teams could reverse positions."
670825,jedimaster,2012-02-28 16:56:00,3472,"Wow, you know your team in n trouble when The Seniority himself, Spezza is your top penalty killer. rofl. Does he change into goalie pads to block shots? Or does he just cherry pick outside the blue line waiting for a puck dump? Might also explain the senioritas 2.97 goals against average. At least the Leafs PK has been getting much better since the horrible begining to the season they had. In fact I believe they have one of the top PK% since the allstar break."
670827,Lip-ripper,2012-02-28 16:57:00,228, Fact - Toronto goalies GAA are 61st and 65th in the league
670828,BillM,2012-02-28 16:58:00,17367," Sweet, if we don't make it to the playoffs, I'll get to watch the Senoritas choke like always!!!   Fantastic entertainment!"
670829,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:00:00,0," not to burst your bubble, but the bingo team won the calder cup last year, and now that roster makes up half our squad."
670831,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:03:00,0, people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones... you have to make the playoffs to choke in them.  such a circular argument.
670834,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:04:00,0," and if that happens all of you can come back and tell my how wrong i am! for now, i'm going to laugh at how you're in the same mediocre rut you were in since 2005.  keep buying that merchandise though!"
670837,BillM,2012-02-28 17:06:00,17367, Why would you want Toronto to make the playoffs?   Aren't you 0 for 4 against them in post season play?
670839,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:09:00,0," i want them to make it so that the sens can knock them out.  it will give leaf fans one less dated accomplishment to cling to amidst their constant failure. now if only habs fans would stop reminding us how many cups they've won... i'd also love it if leaf fans would stop blaming kerry fraser for ""costing"" them a cup."
670843,BillM,2012-02-28 17:11:00,17367," Well if history has anything to do with it, the Sens will make it 0 for 5"
670846,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:13:00,0, thankfully history is the least relevant stat in hockey.
670849,muskymatt,2012-02-28 17:19:00,2608,Hahahahahahahahahhahahaha....Dr.! Absolutely beautiful.....lolol   Bahahahaha
670852,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:22:00,0,"in other news, i heard they were replacing phaneufs ""C"" with an ""O""...."
670853,BillM,2012-02-28 17:23:00,17367, If I was a Sens fan I wouldn't want to look back at all the choking either.  Although the Senoritas have been pretty consistent at it.
670855,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-28 17:25:00,10439," Yep, The Ottawa Senators are the Buffalo Bills of hockey!!!    :rofl2:  :rofl2:"
670856,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:25:00,0,"we get it. you think we choke because of 4 playoff losses when jean chretien was prime minister.  i'll just continue thinking making the playoffs for the better part of 15 years means we are a competitive team with good management and that the leafs not making the playoffs since the lockout is a sign of bad management.  and brian burke isn't a manager, he's a sheep herder."
670860,BillM,2012-02-28 17:29:00,17367,"All this speculating is making me hungry, I'm going to make a sandwich!  I might have to lace it with crack if we keep losing, LOL!"
670861,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:30:00,0, the bills choking happened in the early 90's (just like the leafs) and they've barely made the playoffs and been in decline since (just like the leafs)...they are the only nfl team to not make the playoffs in the 21st century... reminds me of the leafs! are you sure you wanna draw that comparison?
670862,Brettiop,2012-02-28 17:33:00,279,"Happy with Burkes (lack of) deadline deals, didnt need to blow anything up nor Nash, wouldn't have been the answer  While i do hope the leafs make the playoffs, i still dont see it happening.  If we can play like we were early in the year we will certainly have a good shot, but there are just so many teams still with a shot in the east.  It wont be easy"
670863,muskymatt,2012-02-28 17:33:00,2608,Now that's funny!!  LoL
670864,Snidley,2012-02-28 17:35:00,620,"I have two favorite teams, the Leafs and whoever is playing the Sens. With that said the Sens have ""rebuilt"" in one year and will be in the playoffs this year with a decent seeding. I am always concerned when any management in pro sports can't hold a civil press conference treating every question like the party that's asking it is an idiot. Community relations is part of the job in show business after all."
670866,BillM,2012-02-28 17:38:00,17367," I enjoy the ribbing from the Sens fans, I hope you guys enjoy it just as much.  Like I mentioned before, I hope the cup comes back to Canada, regardless of who's town it's in!"
670868,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 17:40:00,0," it's as much a part of the game as hitting, fighting, and drinking cold ones on saturday night!  heaven help which ever team has to face the ribbing when one of our teams finally wins a cup and actually has something worth chirping about."
670600,muskymatt,2012-02-28 02:32:00,2608," Bahahahahahahahaha....what futures? Like the ones from the past 5-6 yrs? All the ones Burke traded away? A bad playoff experience? Bahahahaha That's all the laffs have had!  Are you serious? Burke had nothing on the table, that's why no decent trades happened. Other teams want to improve for a playoff run, I can't name more than 2 players that would be mildly attractive to other teams. Exactly what futures are you talking about. Weren't they all traded away for Kessell?  All Burke did was seal the fate of the season for the laffs, another missed opportunity. Enjoy the golf high lites again boys!!!  lololololol"
670605,muskymatt,2012-02-28 02:37:00,2608," I gotta give you guys credit for hanging in there! Seriously, if I was still a laff fan I would be livid if my team showed 0 commitment to improvement! But you guys stick with them and all their sucking, bad and worse, you still support them! Good on ya!"
670606,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 02:37:00,8333,Ya they should have picked up a minor league goaler.
670611,muskymatt,2012-02-28 02:43:00,2608,"Top numbers minor leaguer, as in best prospect in the league! Time will tell, good thing Burke wasn't in charge or he would have traded, Karlsson, Spezza and Michalek for him. Instead he traded a second round pick and not, a roster player. Imagine that!!!"
670613,BillM,2012-02-28 02:51:00,17367,I'd like to know what the Sens fans think Toronto should have done?  Gone crazy and made a whole bunch of trades because they've had a bad couple of weeks?  LOL!!!   It sounds like some of you guys don't know much about hockey at all with some of the comments in this thread.  OMG WE ARE LOSING LETS TRADE EVERYONE!!!!  Use your heads!
670627,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 03:01:00,8333,Word is your goat asked for a trade but like the blue jackets you were askin' too much.
670633,muskymatt,2012-02-28 03:06:00,2608,"Well, since you ask!  I don't have the answers, neither do any of you, and the brilliant guy(burke) they hired to fix it! He doesn't have the answer either. So I guess the best thing is to just carry on like they have been. Accept sub standard efforts year after year, what ever floats your boat. I know the fans can do zip about it except hope it gets better, so the whole responsibility falls on management, and what a good job they are doing for you! And if they did blow up the team! What about that would be worse than what you have now?"
670639,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-28 03:13:00,2690,"Twenty games left, we'll see how it all plays out. One thing for sure, lots of teams in it, should be a good finish."
670641,Rod Caster,2012-02-28 03:17:00,5784, Are you a part-time stock basher? Haha  Leafs are better off the way they are... There were no sales today.
670643,BillM,2012-02-28 03:20:00,17367," Did you just ignore the entire season the Leafs have had and only focused on the past 3 weeks?   I guess I don't expect much from a Sens fan, I'd be pissed to if my team made the playoffs and choked.......every............single...........time."
670644,muskymatt,2012-02-28 03:29:00,2608,"Stanley cup finals loss is anything but a choke. But as a laff fan, you wouldn't remember that...bahahaha I could see this collapse coming, heck they predicted the Sens to finish LAST in the league. And the Laffs weren't predicted to do much better. So it appears that both teams were punching above their weight class this year. That said, the sens (PRAISE ALFIE) are proving their critics wrong and now just made their team better. AND, you can't say that for the laffs, and that's too bad for the fans. As a Sens fan(PRAISE ALFIE) I'm pretty happy with the season, so far, but it ain't over yet!"
670648,BillM,2012-02-28 03:35:00,17367," A 4-1 series loss to Anahiem isn't choking?  I don't listen to predictions much to be honest, I'm happy the Leafs are playing better as a whole this year then they have in the past few.  I really don't care if they don't make the playoffs, I'll be happy if they keep getting better and better.  You gotta remember, being a Leafs fan isn't about instant gratification!  LOL!!!  If your Sens make the playoffs, I'll gladly cheer for them!  The cup back in Canada is fine by me, even if it's not in Toronto."
670661,Jigger,2012-02-28 05:07:00,1237, This illustrates how much you like to bash the leafs but have no idea what youre talking about.
670783,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 16:15:00,0,"ask a sens fan and he shall receive. burke wasn't capable of making any moves yesterday, not that he stood pat as he insinuates.  first off, in order to make a big splash burke would have to part with a combination of an nhl ready player, a pick, and a prospect.  since the cupboards are already bare (burke's own fault) he had no bargaining leverage and no buying power for any kind of big name.  the other reason no move was made is that burke's not willing to involve himself with lengthy contracts.  this is fine and dandy, but take a look at the contracts of the stars in the league and they all have long term, 6-7 mill a year contracts... you gotta pay for the goods, and burke isn't willing.  to really know what this sens fan would have done different, you'd have to go back a few seasons to when burke blew the team up... personally, i would have rebuilt around a solid core of young players, and never sold the farm for a one dimensional ""star"" who doesn't back check and is scared to be body checked.  perhaps the leafs would have challenged the oilers for last place for a season or two, but in a year or two from now they would be challenging the oilers for first place.  instead, burke brought in a slew of over-rated d-men like francois beauchemin, mike komisarek, dion phaneuf, and stocked your forward lines with 2nd and 3rd line calibre players on your top line, and your record shows it.  he also brought in an amazingly over-rated coach who couldn't get past the first or second round of the playoffs with one of the most stacked squads in the league (san jose).  enjoy mediocrity.  burke's built a team around it."
670789,jedimaster,2012-02-28 16:21:00,3472,"With 20 games left, considering the leafs have what 1 win in the last 8 games or something and they are only 3 points out with 3 games in hand on the team in 8th? I am fairly happy considering I had no expectations of making, and I was going to be happy with seeing everyone develop this year and challenge for a spot. The position they are in is exactly what my amitions were for the team this year."
670803,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 16:34:00,0,another sellout crowd at the ACC:  
670804,BillM,2012-02-28 16:35:00,17367," The record shows that we have 2 top 10 players in the league with points, 3rd in the league with goals scored.  You Sens fans sure love opinions instead of facts."
670805,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 16:36:00,0,wow... you'd think with 2 top ten point getters you wouldn't be out of the playoff picture eh?
670807,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 16:39:00,0,"oh wait, kessel is only +3 and doesn't work the penalty kill to bring his stats down... hmmmm... so at even strength or on PP he manages to let as many goals go in his own net as his line puts in the other... now before you say Jason Spezza is only a +7, realize that jason spezza is on our top penalty killing line.  stats can be used to prove any argument.  the only stat that matters is wins.  if your team is so loaded with talent and potential, why are you 10th in the east?     .....   AFTER 3 SEASONS!"
670809,BillM,2012-02-28 16:40:00,17367," Wow is right, it's funny when you Senorita fans ignore simple things like facts and just rant and rave all day.  Keep at it!"
670813,Chance,2012-02-28 16:45:00,420,  Why are the Sens 7th with all that talent ?
670815,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 16:47:00,0," in the playoffs in the first year of a rebuild.  we're happy.  quit being jealous.  factor in that we have mika zibanejad, mark stone, shane prince, and matt puempel, robin lehner etc. in the pipes and it's not hard to be excited as a sens fan."
670818,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 16:51:00,0," here's a fact.  we're in the playoffs right now, you're not.  good luck ignoring that fact."
670819,Brettiop,2012-02-28 16:52:00,279," PK and PP do not count towards +\-  So in this case, stats were used to tie your argument  Saying Kessel and Lupul aren't top line players is a horrible argument that you cannot win."
670820,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-28 16:53:00,0, burned!!!  haha
670412,Chance,2012-02-27 20:03:00,420,  That would depend on which GM
670413,Chance,2012-02-27 20:05:00,420,  It depends on who Columbus asks for and if they are willing to give them up.The Rangers said no to Del Zotto and the Leafs no to Gardiner.Sounds like columbus drew a line in the sand so its a wait until the summer and see for Nash.
670414,davey buoy,2012-02-27 20:08:00,5505,Burke has done nothing unless there is something in the works after 3:00. That small trade whatever.Serves Burke right if they don't make the playoffs. I'm a leafs fan but can't see they have enough at this point. Maybe it's time for Burke to move on.IMO.
670419,Chance,2012-02-27 20:13:00,420,Fans have been screaming for years for the brass to stop giving up young players and draft picks for quick fixes.Well that is exactly what he is doing and yet some want to go back to the old ways??? Nash would be awesome but not at the cost of two young guys and picks.Why sacrifice youth to maybe and I repeat maybe scrape into the playoffs? I say sit in 9th or 10th and do some tinkering in the summer.
670420,jedimaster,2012-02-27 20:14:00,3472,"Sounds like nothing is going on. lol its so funny, now they have stopped analyzing trades that didn't happen and are analogizing why there were no trades and they all wasted there time."
670422,BillM,2012-02-27 20:14:00,17367,"The Leafs did the smart thing, leave the young guys alone..."
670423,Chance,2012-02-27 20:15:00,420,Boston has made some smart moves today !
670426,jedimaster,2012-02-27 20:18:00,3472,"  I don't think Nash gets us into the playoffs. I think the leafs need a goalie. I like the leafs defense, they are so young still, they need a few years to mature. If you defense is weak you need a strong goalie(aka Vancouver). If your goalie is weak you need a strong defense(aka Detroit)... The leafs are building both from youth. This year from the beginning I said they leafs would miss unless reimer pans out. So far he hasn't(I would blame this mostly on alaire and the injury). I am happy the leafs have a competitive team and CAN compete with any team on any given night. (aside from Boston).  I would have liked to see a deal for a vet goalie but I guess we got what we got."
670427,davey buoy,2012-02-27 20:19:00,5505, I'd say!. Look out everyone!
670432,jedimaster,2012-02-27 20:24:00,3472,"Leafs, mitchel for fraiser? no idea who either of them are."
670434,jimmer,2012-02-27 20:27:00,2730,"No kidding! They need to get rid of some of those guys on the sports shows. They look kind of silly today after nothing really transpired. Those stations must have money to throw away. Oh ya, one is owned by Rogers."
670437,jimmer,2012-02-27 20:29:00,2730,Aren't they baseball players? lol
670438,Lip-ripper,2012-02-27 20:33:00,228,The leafs got MARK FRASER!?!?!?!?!?  Plan the parade... it's back on!  
670439,Chance,2012-02-27 20:37:00,420,"  I still think Reimer can pull it together unless of course he is gun shy from his injury or there are lingering problems.I also believe their defense in the A will be much better than they have now on the big club.One of their glaring problems is Phaneuf,he is unmotivated.He does however have a larger than life attitude and that is why he was given the C .If anything the Leafs would benefit the most by adding a Dustin Brown and Steve Ott and ship out Armstrong.Then go looking for an upgrade on D and get rid of Phaneuf and Komi .Pipe dreams of course but hey why not."
670447,tb4me,2012-02-27 20:57:00,3295,"I also belive Burke did good today..He didnt drain the depth we have and he added a 1st rounder. Im glad he didnt blow out the team. I could care less about the playoffs at this point, the rebuild is still in full swing. Stick to the blueprint Burkie..Atta boy. Now the Leafs can breathe a sigh of relief. They can get back to hockey without the drama..Hopefully thats all they need..If not then back to the blurprint july 1st.. It is what it is."
670448,davey buoy,2012-02-27 21:04:00,5505," Ya,what's another year or so:angry:"
670450,BillM,2012-02-27 21:05:00,17367, No point in trying to buy a cup or a playoff spot..  That's a waste of talent and $$$
670452,tb4me,2012-02-27 21:11:00,3295,Burke has done lots for the future of the Leafs weather he there or not. He is a smart man. I cant blame him for not clearing house. He is a first class man. He may be fired or die of a massive heart attack or heck he may even still be the GM of the Leafs but he has one heck of a solid future ahead for us and this team...
670454,davey buoy,2012-02-27 21:16:00,5505,"We should be used to this, I know, let's try and give a little bit back to the fans is all I'm trying to say. Cheers."
670473,Grimace,2012-02-27 22:05:00,2020,Losing a playoff series is good development.  It's experience.  I hope they squeak in.  Overall I am not very happy.
670474,Chance,2012-02-27 22:16:00,420,Winning the cup or getting to the finals is good experience.Getting in and playing a round is just a couple more games in the season. At this point all these guys have played in the big game somewhere along the lines.Many have played in championships so another four playoff games wont teach them much.
670493,kickingfrog,2012-02-27 23:03:00,8333,"Definitely playoff experience, even a bad one, can be beneficial. I'm just not interested in giving up futures for squeaking in at this stage."
670505,tb4me,2012-02-27 23:33:00,3295,I'm with you on this..Leafers relax were only 3 points out! That's nothing. Burke thinks they can do it and so do I! Now that the boys can relax and forget the trades they can get back to their game! Burke knows what he is doing..I just think a couple of Sens fans are doing a good job at getting us down..I cant wait till its our turn.Again.
670506,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-27 23:42:00,10439, It would be nice to face the Sens in the first round and watch them choke again. I love it when that happens. Too bad it has been so long.
670566,uglyfish,2012-02-28 01:28:00,981,"He shouldn't have traded aulie. He should have moved gunnarsson if anyone currently playing. I like gunnarsson, but he would have gotten a good return. Phaneuf or liles would be the best to move. He should have sent grabovski and or macarthur too.  BUT, ashton carter is a good young kid. I'm soi so so happy he kept schenn. And for everyone who's crying for burkes head on a stake, trading for the sake of trading, isn't smart hockey and selling the farm for a player who MIGHT help ur team get in the playoffs. However, waiting till the off season, he could pick up nash or whoever, for half the cost now. They have a good young team, that will get better. They have a good young goalie, who will get better. Once the team starts using their speed, and hitting again, and get back to basics defense and just learn to cover their own end, they will be a good team. They have a ton of young talent."
670353,Lip-ripper,2012-02-27 16:58:00,228,"From the trade blog I'm following:  11:50 AM: Burke also said it’s unlikely he’ll extend Grabovksi and that he had an offer for Reimer that he turned down. (Sorry for the delay, been having software issues here sometimes today. Grrrr.). Cam Cole of Vancouver Sun tweets: “Still gobsmacked that there was (a) an offer for James Reimer and ( one so crappy that Brian Burke would turn it down flat. Flat!  "
670357,muskymatt,2012-02-27 17:06:00,2608,"WOW...even I'm shocked, Burke actually turned down an offer for Reimer?? Worse record than Ferguson and he's not trading!!!!!! And he thinks this will go over well with the fans????? Got me thinking maybe Burke has lost his marbles  Sens get a goalie and look good down the stretch, can't say the same for the laffs, too bad for a Canadian team!!"
670360,Lip-ripper,2012-02-27 17:16:00,228,"12:11 PM: TOR GM Burke tells TSN he has nothing on the front burner or the back burner. Repeats Grabovski won’t be traded, goalie trades don’t make sense."
670361,BillM,2012-02-27 17:23:00,17367,"I think Reimer needs to sort himself out after that concussion, I wouldn't throw him on the chopping block just yet.   Enough of the knee jerk reaction trades because the guys has had a bad few weeks (Even if this is the wrong time to be in a slump).."
670364,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-27 17:27:00,10439," Not only that the fact that Burke still has faith in him and turned down trading him should perk Reimer up. Hopefully it will nudge him back in the right direction, it will be one less thing to worry about anyway."

I hope James duthie keeps be.ating a dead horse on tv.  Proves that the air time for TSN's show is ridiculous and should be shortened from 12-6, rather than 8-6."

670385,jedimaster,2012-02-27 18:37:00,3472,Keith aulie to tampa... for what? noone knows yet.
670386,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-27 18:40:00,10439, For a tin of Tim Horton's coffee and a gallon of maple syrup. Because you can never have enough.
670387,jedimaster,2012-02-27 18:42:00,3472,Carter Ashton...Not a bad prospect in a few years.
670388,kickingfrog,2012-02-27 18:45:00,8333,Ashton is a forward.
670391,Chance,2012-02-27 18:57:00,420,"  I dont think Burke decided NOT to make said trades its that he either cant or the price is alot higher than he is willing to pay,in other words ridiculous.Dont read too much into what he or any other GM says at this time of year."
670392,Lip-ripper,2012-02-27 19:00:00,228,Leafs trade Aulie --- Aulie will probably be the next Chara... lol
670393,Chance,2012-02-27 19:00:00,420,"  Ashton is a good player,agreed but as you mention he wont be NHL ready for a few years, if he plays up to expectations that is."
670396,Chance,2012-02-27 19:09:00,420,I still think Nash moves today....where oh where could he land ???
670397,BillM,2012-02-27 19:11:00,17367, Rangers is my guess!
670400,Chance,2012-02-27 19:15:00,420,  I dont think so as the Jackets are asking for one of their top guys in return.Why break up that sort of chemistry.If I were the Rangers I say go for depth going into the playoffs and support for a great team.
670404,Rod Caster,2012-02-27 19:21:00,5784," I dont' understand how the rangers can be so stacked with players and still have room for Nash, while the leafs have a couple high priced players, but mostly mid-range nobodys and they don't/can't get an elite player on their lineup. Are they afraid to spend money???"
670405,BillM,2012-02-27 19:31:00,17367, I'd love to see the inner workings of a GM's brain as much as you   I don't get it sometimes either!

670223,tb4me,2012-02-27 02:03:00,3295,No I never seen a pic of it..Im complaining of the fact that he smokes in 2012. No wonder he cant compete at an elite level..
670231,BillM,2012-02-27 02:18:00,17367, He can't compete but he's a NHL captain.  I guess you know something no one else does.
670337,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-27 16:10:00,0,montreal has begun selling off... kostitsyn is gone to nashville! brian burke should take notes on how to build a team from the ground up... i predict montreal will be competitive before Toronto and that stings.
670349,Grimace,2012-02-27 16:47:00,2020,"We need a goalie, a tough winger that can work the wall, a shut down defenseman, a first line centre, a second line centre and a coach.  But other than that I think we are fine."
670351,muskymatt,2012-02-27 16:52:00,2608,Burke has gone public and said he's not doing anything(no trades) as he feels the laffs are in fact good enough and he thinks they are a playoff team  Wow.....good luck laff nation....  Bahahahaahaha
669588,Chance,2012-02-24 18:32:00,420, Its all about the money the playoffs generate.Playoff rounds equal revenue and owners love revenue !
669589,tb4me,2012-02-24 18:33:00,3295,"Awesome Chance, you and I think alike..As far as Allaire goes its time to move on. Look at how many goalies he has messed up. It all started with Giggy under JFJ and then Fletcher. The man has got to go. Its almost like our golaies start to strugle a bit then Alliare gets into their heads..Argh...."
669590,Oggie,2012-02-24 18:34:00,588,I'd keep both goalies and fire the leafs goalie coach. They brought him in to coach giguere. He's long gone but the coach stayed and forced an antiquated style on two young goalie. He has ruined Rimer.
669592,Rod Caster,2012-02-24 18:38:00,5784, Are you Ray Ferraro? You must have watched yesterdays game on TSN because that's pretty much exactly what he said.  Frankie: habs in the basement is great entertainment isn't it?. Hahahabs. I can't believe how badly that team drafts
669593,Oggie,2012-02-24 18:38:00,588,It is disgusting that burke and wilson select American players over canadians. Their nuts picking all these NCAA players. They play a 20 game schedule which is not the real world.
669595,jimmer,2012-02-24 18:45:00,2730,"I agree that they would benefit from making the playoffs for the experience, most successful teams go through this process, so I hope they can squeak in. I just can't believe that making a few trades (trading assets) at this point is benficial to a team trying to grow into a playoff team. Getting rid of the dead wood would be fine; however, no other GM seems to biting at them. Really, they aren't going anywhere this year, so wait until the summer to add some missing pieces. And I can't figure Nash out, he had the opportunity to go anywhere he wanted when he was a free agent and what did he do? He signed with that powerhouse team he is presently playing for. He didn't want anything to do with TO at that time."
669600,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-24 18:57:00,0,burkie could be up to something.  rumour has it he's still in the works for rick nash although he will literally have to sell the farm to get him.  at least he didn't blame waiving rosehill on the state of the game like he did with colton orr.
669601,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-24 18:58:00,0, accuses me of not being knowledgeable then plagiarizes a popular hockey commentator!!! i love it.  go leafs go!
669619,Chance,2012-02-24 20:02:00,420,  Uh hu yeah now ya got it. Its common knowledge throughout the NHL what Allaire does to goalies.Did you honestly think it was some super insider secret that only Allaire and Reimer knew about. Oh and for the record I did not say you were not knowledgeable.I said you had limited hockey knowledge.Not knowing what is common knowledge is also a sign of limited knowledge.
669620,Chance,2012-02-24 20:07:00,420,"  Naw I am much taller,wouldn't mind his pay cheque though.Missed most of the game last night but doesnt sound like I missed much from a Leafs perspective.It sounds like Ferraro said what everyone is well aware of.You only need to watch a handful of games to see both Reimer and Gus have changed styles.Obviously it isnt working for either,no other suspect but the teacher."
669622,Chance,2012-02-24 20:10:00,420,  Out of curiosity did Ferraro mention Mitch Korn ? I would love to see him in Toronto and think he would turn things around with Reimer and Gus.
669626,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-24 20:23:00,0,"well shucks.  you've got me.  i have limited knowledge of the game of hockey.  i feel humbled to be in the same online forum as such an illustrious armchair gm as yourself.  if only you were in charge, the leafs wouldn't be in such poor shape.  did you play the game, coach the game, or did you learn all your knowledge from watching coach's corner?"
669653,uglyfish,2012-02-24 21:34:00,981,"Grabo should be moved. He's not worth 5 mil a year, not even close."
669727,lowdeuces22,2012-02-25 01:05:00,3,"Grabo, and any player, are only ""worth"", what a GM is willing to pay them. 4m/year is probably closer to his ""worth"", compared to others with similar numbers."
669772,Rod Caster,2012-02-25 03:39:00,5784," From the parts I saw, no he didn't. Yes, Gus and Reimer need some serious tweaking. Where is Justin Pogge when you need him?"
669773,uglyfish,2012-02-25 03:50:00,981,"  no, even 4 mil is way too much. its no secret i dont like grabovski. but for him, i wouldnt pay much more then 2mil a year fr his services. and even then, i would damand more from him and make him a much more accountable defensive zone player. trading him would be smart rite now, his value is high and u can get something god in return. seeing dustin brown in a leaf jersey would be nice. i like his style of play. trading schenn would be a stupid move. they need defense, trading arguably ur best defensive dman, is not smart. moving kadri, also dumb. kid just keeps getting better as he grows and learns. nash would be great to have. but cant sell the farm to get him. burke is smart, he'll figure something out i hope. nash playing along tim connally could be a scary combo. kulemin on the other side and u could have a very dominate line to back kessel, lupal and bozak."
669828,kickingfrog,2012-02-25 15:42:00,8333,I wonder if we are getting all the information. Most people hold a knife with their blocker hand.
669972,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-26 03:33:00,0,  for some reason when i heard about this all i could think about was clint malarchuk. gross.
670037,Jigger,2012-02-26 14:23:00,1237,"Was really wishing that I woke to the ""Wilson fired"" heading today. Too bad its not going to happen. I'm starting to get ready to jump onto the Tank Nation bandwagon, keep the youth, package out some vets for picks/prospects. Nash is redundant now, I'd way rather Burke make a huge push for Parise on July 1st."
670038,jedimaster,2012-02-26 14:27:00,3472,"Burke was offered a first rounder grabo. After last night washout of a game the leafs have gone from buyer to sell monday everything willbecome clear. If the leafs dump gustaf and grab they are selling, hopefully they can get a few good draft picks, I would think gustaf and grab won't re sign and burke will move them both and pick up a goalie in the ufa season. Hopefully they can pile up a few more draft pickss and use them as bait to get a big center."
670053,davey buoy,2012-02-26 15:34:00,5505," There's still time to do something,if he chooses to do nothing I think this time their will be some fan and media uproar towards Burke big time imo."
670055,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-26 15:40:00,2690," The problem now is this terrible stretch has put the Leafs in a worse position for dealing.  They look desperate, and Other GM's can smell that a mile away."
670071,tb4me,2012-02-26 17:04:00,3295,I honestly dont think Burke could care less. He is the type of GM that deals only if he gets what he wants in return. He honestly could care less what other gm'S think or smell.. On another note the Sens pick-up Ben Bishop from the Blues. looks like the Anderson kitchen blunder is going to be a while healing...
670086,davey buoy,2012-02-26 18:20:00,5505,"So it's his fourth year I believe,how many years does it take to get what you want?.This is the most valuable team in the league,also I believe the highest ticket prices,let's get moving Burke,or it'll be another who knows how many years,just to make the playoffs!."
670102,Jigger,2012-02-26 19:34:00,1237,"Ben Bishop to Ott. Great move by BM. Got a goaltending problem? Fix it. Novel idea, eh, Burkie?"

669523,Rod Caster,2012-02-24 16:12:00,5784, They are officialy sellers for trade deadline
669536,Harrison,2012-02-24 16:54:00,2202,"15 yrs ago or so the Leafs competed when they had players who would go into the corners with their head down if they had to.  Every team needs at least one pretty boy with fancy tape on their sticks that float around the red line wating for a puck on the tape, but the leafs have a dozen.  I can't help but be a frustrated fan supporting a team that is supposed to be the Hockey Mecca, brings in the most revenue by far but has one of the worst gelled teams on the ice. Not just for one year, or two, or five.... There is no excuse IMO.  Fill the team with Clarkson like players from NJ and one hollywood Kessel at the red line youcould at least say, wow what a shift.  I feel a little better, I really do want to watch leaf games agian and care.  Hopefully soon."
669545,Chance,2012-02-24 17:09:00,420,"  Ehhh  12th , 9th doesnt really matter.They get in great,if not it wont be a surprise. What I find humorous are the so called ""other teams fans"" who focus on the Leafs and where they sit in the standings.Oh or should I say Laffs, oh my that is quite clever.Their only true agenda is trying to agitate supporters of the Leafs with the standard mindless drivel. I mean seriously if you want to hold someone up as a shinning example of a great player I highly doubt anyone with hockey knowledge jumps at the name Alfredsson.There are no current Leafs on that list either as I did say seriously.The same can be said for a great team,Sens ...reeeaaalllyy.you want great and stands a chance at winning the cup look at detroit,vancouver,bruins etc....."
669549,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-24 17:19:00,0, we have to speak in a way leaf fans can understand.
669552,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-24 17:23:00,0,p.s. none of us sens fans are planning any parades... just happy our kids are competing harder than the team the last few years.  as long as we're trending upward i won't complain.
669553,Chance,2012-02-24 17:24:00,420,  As I said limited hockey knowledge leads to trying to agitate fans rather than a hockey based discussion.
669554,Chance,2012-02-24 17:25:00,420,"  Hey i would love to see a Canadain team win the cup.Just dont see it happening anytime soon,unless of course Vancouver pulls of a miracle."
669556,Chance,2012-02-24 17:29:00,420,"  Naw I am Canadian first and would cheer for Ottawa , Montreal or whomever but it just isnt happening."
669557,Chance,2012-02-24 17:33:00,420,The playoffs are a completely different animal and toughness is the flavour of the day.Karlsson is an amazing player right now but come playoff time he might get eaten alive.The same can be said of the leafs Gunnerson.While not the same quality as Karlsson he is in the same boat when it comes to durability.
669560,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-24 17:38:00,0," I have pretty good sense of the game and am blessed enough to get to watch a lot of hockey.  If you want to discuss any of the finer points of the game, I'd be more than willing to oblige, especially if we are talking ""hockey"", as opposed to talking ""leafs"".   But, given that us sens fans used to consider the leafs our arch nemesis, I see no problem in the ""mindless"" joshing that goes on in these threads.  We're all big boys and most of us get a kick out of trying to rile the other guys up.  As far as focusing on the leafs, don't feel special.  I like to bash the habs just as much."
669561,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-24 17:38:00,10439,"   I would cheer for the Hawks, Wings or Bruins before I would the Sens and I hate all three of those teams!!! I just hate Ottawa more!!!!    :tease:"
669563,Chance,2012-02-24 17:39:00,420,  Depends on the bar.Sometimes its best to go with the crowd and make it out alive
669567,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-24 17:41:00,0," amen brother.  i miss the days when our insults were of substance and the stakes were real.   i will cheer for toronto though... the habs, i won't even say their name without spitting."
669570,Chance,2012-02-24 17:44:00,420,"  I find myself disliking individual players rather than teams.Ribero,Matt Cooke as examples,really its just what they bring to the game."

669582,tb4me,2012-02-24 18:14:00,3295,"I agree, something is brewing. Id like to see Burke move Army and Komi ASAP. they are just healthy scratches night after night. I also think Wilson has got to tell Reims he is the #1 going ahead. This pressure of ""win and your in"" has destroyed both of these young goalies. Grabo wants over 5 mill a year, with him a free agent in the summer I willing to bet he gets moved as a rental to a contending team. If burke does make a big move (witch I doubt) between today and Monday id be a happy leafer. If we don't make the playoff's I can say Willy is a goner..Thats all I have to say for now..."
669583,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-24 18:17:00,2690,"  The funny thing is how riled up some of the guys get.  I'm as big a Leafs fan as anyone on here, but, don't take it personally.  My biggest thrill right now is seeing the Habs in the basement, sad as that may sound"
669585,jimmer,2012-02-24 18:23:00,2730,"Not sure if somethings brewing, they just weren't performing, so wasting a roster spot that could be filled with someone that might actually score seems silly. Not sure a trade will make any difference for the Leafs at this point. I just can't see them making anykind of playoff run if they actually get into the playoffs. Burke should keep sight on building a team through the draft and minors. I can see making a trade if they were battling the Rangers or Bruins for top spot, but they're not there yet."
669586,Chance,2012-02-24 18:25:00,420," A few teams have asked about Armstrong,Komi however,not so much The trouble with Reimer actually stems back to Allaire and his style.Reimer was decent when he came into the NHL as everyone remembers.Allaire got ahold of him on a regular basis and changed his style to suit his teachings.Reimer shrinks in net with his head down.When you have a big athletic goalie you should work on his reactionary skills and use a combintaion approach rather than my way or the highway,adapt kid or see you later.I would rather see Mitch Korn in Toronto than Allaire. LA asked about Grabo in the past so packaging him with Schenn would get Brown,a much needed addition.Take it for what it is worth but Nash is pushing for Toronto as his destination."

Okay isn't this called developing playoff experience? Has a team ever won the cup who had no one with any previous playoff experience? So if I understand this when we do finally make the post season we will likely be going to the cup finals? Taken from mapleafs.com, but this guy has a good point. Why not ""just get in"" They do need to develope playoff experience.."

Funny how other NHL players consider him one of the most talented guys period, but alas, the laff fans mock. I guess when you haven't had talent like that, you don't recognize it."
669273,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-23 22:26:00,0,i love the alfie hating because top notch athletes like #11 feed off it.  i've been trying to find leaf players to hate on these days but it's hard to care when they haven't been relevant since the lockout.    i was hoping to reignite the battle of ontario in the post season but it seems like as always only 1/2 of ontario is going to make it this year.

We would have to have him throuroughly cleansed by virgin nuns in blessed holy water from The Don river before he would be allowed to put on a blue and white. This injury reminds me of the time Kelly Gruber was out with an injury when he stubbed his toe on his dock. If its a bad cut on his catching hand I would imagine it'll take at least a few weeks to heal up enough to catch a puck. I would imagine he cuts with the same hand he holds his stick with."

And Yes, you can see the Sens only getting better from where they are now. It's awesome how having a good coach and good drafts can benefit a team. Something the Laffs have lacked for over 40yrs and is why they will miss the playoffs yet again!"

669204,muskymatt,2012-02-23 19:15:00,2608,1920 something?? Of course it's kind of hard to win when you don't have a team for 70 some odd years! Kinda like the Laffs!!! Bwhahahaa
669206,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-23 19:25:00,0, that was pretty much the high point of your season eh?
668743,BillM,2012-02-22 02:51:00,17367,"At least they got a point, better then a big fat goose egg."
668747,uglyfish,2012-02-22 02:56:00,981,"  yea... but at this time of year... a point, isnt gonna help them. they need 2 points. cant be losing games like this, they should have won. they outplayed NJ for the better part of the game, and a couple defensive gaffs, and poor goaltending, cost them."
668749,BillM,2012-02-22 02:58:00,17367,"They were down a goal with 43 seconds to go, I'd take the point."
668760,jedimaster,2012-02-22 03:50:00,3472,"Yah, I would agree with BillM on this one. They played hard all game, gustaf made a few good saves, but did let in some sucky goals. That last one was a dagger in the back. Is Turco that out of the question for the stretc run? They deserved that one point. If they had better goal tending they should have had 2 points. That was a tough one. Lupals face at the end was priceless."
668763,muskymatt,2012-02-22 03:56:00,2608,"Yup, Kessel, Lupol play decent but still don't get er done! D sucks and you get away with a lucky point. Problem is, the pack is pulling away, quickly, and the Laffs are spiraling out of control..lololol Not sure, but do any of you guys really expect it to change? Same ol same ol as far as I can see. Effort can't always match better competition, and the laffs luck is running out! GO SENS GO"
668869,jedimaster,2012-02-22 17:08:00,3472,"Without adding anything else to the teams, a good goalie would have added several wins to the season thus far for the leafs. It should be more apparent now than ever that the goaltending is the weak point for the leafs. Similar position to the Sens actually, both are near the bottom in goals against this year. I would take reimer or gustavsun's GAA as a backup over either the Sens Auld any day of the week. The starting goalie for the sens is only marginally better than either of our two backups. I just hope the leafs can pick up a goaltender. I would think Boston will be shedding a goalie this offseason, perhaps even vancouver. Nitimake, roloson, huet and vokoun are all free agents this year afaik, so there is the possibility of upgrading."
668879,uglyfish,2012-02-22 17:43:00,981,"U can't fault the goaltending. Last nite yes, 100% gustavssons fault. But for the most part, he and reimer, have played very well and its the team defense that costs them goals and wins."
668881,jedimaster,2012-02-22 17:48:00,3472,"The goaltending has not been very good. If it was there would be one goalie playing. Reimer isn't a starter yet. Gustaf still let's in the weak ones almost every game. The leafs need to ride one guy and pick up a vet goal help him in the offseason.  Reimer has term and the contract. Schnieder is an rfa, maybe Burke can pick him up. Likely not as burke won't do an offer sheet. One guy needs to be given the starts. 20 games left its go time."
668882,BillM,2012-02-22 17:52:00,17367,"Goaltending last night definitely wasn't very good, those were 3 softies that any NHL goalie should have had (especially the OT winner, lol)"
668883,Rod Caster,2012-02-22 17:56:00,5784,"Goofstavsen is back!  I never liked his play, he is mediocre at best. The air canada center is but a giant goalie cemetary.  They need to take some tips from the coyotes who can turn any backup goalie into a vezina contender....beyond that the Coyotes have nothing to offer haha."
668893,d_paluch,2012-02-22 18:32:00,343,"The thing I've noticed with Gustavsson is he can make some of the nicest saves you'll see, but let in some of the weakest.  He is not much of a positional goaltender as he is reflex. Reminds me of Hasek...only not nearly as good/lucky lol"
668894,BillM,2012-02-22 18:35:00,17367,"I don't think their goaltending has been that bad to be honest, people are just focusing on it because of last nights game.  For the most part both goalies do a decent job, however nothing like the stand on your head goaltending the Leafs had in the early-mid 90's."
668896,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-22 18:39:00,390," Nope, here is what I posted in the first page of this thread on the 16th:  Regardless of Nash in the lineup, Leafs are not getting past first round without a goalie. Probably won't make the playoffs with who they have in net now."
668901,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-22 18:45:00,10439,Goaltending was pretty decent early in the season but since Reimers concussion it has been pretty poor. Reimer seems like a completely different goalie now.
668916,kickingfrog,2012-02-22 19:13:00,8333,"Reimer is the only thing that weasel has hit in his whole career. Who knows what Reimer was/is going to be but he has not been the same. The defensive play of the team also impacts the goaltending. They try to press the other team (remember the game against the wings?) When it works they look very good, when it doesn't there are breakdowns that look horrible.  G looked very bad on 3 goals last night but there were some saves in the third that kept the team in the game.  Edit: Flippin' phone auto spell."
668919,jedimaster,2012-02-22 19:25:00,3472,I would rather let in the good honest goals by the other team than weak goals any day of the week. This may sound stupid but I would trade that kovalchuk breakaway save for one of any of the weak goals. Did you see lupals face? Its a heart breaker to lose on a bad flub goal like that.
668924,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-22 19:33:00,2690,"Three words  Youth---young team, that needs to find...  Consistency---as they mature, and learn from games like last night it should help to build  Character---any winning team goes on the ice expecting to win, NOT, trying to not lose!!"
668926,Headhunter,2012-02-22 19:39:00,5703,"I have to agree with both camps here... the goaltending has not been consistant and at times has looked amateur, but what really stands out to me, has been the play of their ""better"" defense men. Both Lyles and Dion have looked like crap in the last few weeks. I won't comment on the kids' play as, well, they are still kids and have a lot of learning and growing to do... but the established guys have looked aweful... especially Dion. It pains me to say this, but I will continue to believe, much like I have for most of the season, that this team will not make the play-offs. HH"
668937,Live2fish85,2012-02-22 20:20:00,1633,"As much as the Def suck the goalies are there to stop things that the Def can't. I have seen gus bite before the shoter has even made a move, he is always on his knees before they shot and Riemer has looked like crap since he has returned.  As much as alot of you complain about  Grabo he plays with more heart then most of the leafs they all make mistakes. I would rather Grabo cough it up after rushig in the corner then Kessel stop skating after it because someones skating at him from the other team. I have seen kessel avoid getting the puck in the corner to avoid a hit never grabo though. Kessel gets as many points as he does because he has lupul and people helpimg him. The odd point because of digging but not many."
669004,uglyfish,2012-02-23 00:13:00,981,"  Grabo always stays clear of the dirty areas, and anytime someone touches him he gets knocked down. And he doesn't play with more heart then anyone. If u really watch him, he floats around a lot and let's others do the work. Kessel tends to play the same way, early in the season when he was at his best, he was gettin in and forechecking. Grabo has a me first mentality most of the time. If u really watch him, u can see it."
669011,BillM,2012-02-23 00:37:00,17367,I don't care his mentality as long as he's scoring goals.
669014,muskymatt,2012-02-23 01:01:00,2608,"Nice quote from Burke, need to see what the going prices are for goalies. Talk about a lack of confidence quote, bwahahaha. It's shocking how much the laffs sucking can dominate the airwaves, kind of sad actually. But you gotta admit those goals were Lalime quality, or maybe even worse. All the comments about Kessel avoiding making plays if he's going to be hit, they are so true, it's all about kessel and not the team. He's got figjam big time. At this rate the laffs will finish out of the playoffs and just out of a good draft pick, again...lol Go Sens Go"

668349,jedimaster,2012-02-21 00:04:00,3472,I think carter would be a better trade than nash$ I am not knocking nash but the leafs need a center more than another winger.
668353,kickingfrog,2012-02-21 00:19:00,8333," Neither nash nor carter are playmakers in the truest sense and I think that's part of the reason that they haven't clicked with each other. Injuries also impacted carter's start.  I don't like either player's term, or trade cost.  Leafs need more help keeping pucks out of their own net then they do putting pucks in the other. A big, playmaking, centre sure would be nice, but what teams doesn't want/need one of those?"
668388,muskymatt,2012-02-21 01:31:00,2608,"  Like Spezza??    Tell me you wouldn't swap Panuf for Karlsson? Or anyone for Spezza, heck I'd bet if it came down to it, laff fans would welcome D. Alfredsson (praise Alfie)with open arms if they thought he'd help them win. Fact is Burke keeps making idiotic, media driven acquisitions and the fans eat it up.  Look at the Wings, Penguins and even Ottawa for that matter, they have had the luxury of quality top management. Years of success and able to rebound when needed, the laffs have had Burke, and Wilson.  Silly laffs, when will they ever learn?  "
668403,kickingfrog,2012-02-21 01:55:00,8333,"Spezza? The Leafs already have forwards that don't hit.  Years of top quality management???  Wings - cups, Penguins -cup, Zeros-bupkiss.  The penguins drafted right at the top for years, it had nothing to do with quality management."
668407,muskymatt,2012-02-21 02:01:00,2608," Are you  saying having Mario Lemieux as an owner didn't have any thing to do with their success???  Think again  So is that a no on Spezza as a leaf? You didn't outright say no, and I actually saw him throw a few checks the other night....amazing!!  :lol:"
668411,kickingfrog,2012-02-21 02:08:00,8333," Finishing last and drafting flurry, gino and winning the crosby lottery had nothing to do with mario. but by all means keep bring up more facts.  Where spezza's checks on purpose? Where they his own teammates?"
668413,muskymatt,2012-02-21 02:15:00,2608," Ok, so they did it all on their own, I see where the laffs problems fall now. On their ""the draft will do it all for us"" attitude...but wait....that didn't work for the laffs either. Why you ask?  :dunno:  Because Burke traded them all away.  :w00t:  :w00t:  :rofl2:  :rofl2:  And yah.....Spezza runs around checking his own team mates...  Imagine that"
668414,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-21 02:31:00,2690,"Kudos to the Sens for bouncing back after that ugly stretch. We'll see if ""my"" Leafs can do the same.  This week should tell the story."
668420,muskymatt,2012-02-21 02:36:00,2608," It is interesting how a schedule can benefit a team, the Sens have 12 of their last 22 against teams that are lower in the standing and the Leafs have a rather tough schedule ahead of them. It will be interesting to see how they do."
668504,Rod Caster,2012-02-21 14:55:00,5784,"  Wow, four points for Carelson. Good stuff. Ott is looking promising right now. Still, I can't stand hearing or seeing Spezza. I've never seen anybody back-pass out of the opposition's zone so many times. The leafs are old news now; looks like the Jets have as much of a chance at making the playoffs  2 more poiints and they will sit third in the East  The MTS Center will go NUTS if they make it in this year."
668511,Rod Caster,2012-02-21 15:24:00,5784," Put it this way then, one more point and WPG takes over 8th from the leafs.  Pacific is close, PHX can jump from 7th to 3rd with three more points. They are currently 2 points away from 9th."
668518,jedimaster,2012-02-21 16:10:00,3472,tonight will be a big night for the bottow feeders in the east. Leafs need this win.  BTW  NO SPEZZA and NO Alfafaredson
668539,BillM,2012-02-21 17:07:00,17367,"Yup, Leafs gotta turn the corner and get out of this losing streak."
668541,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-21 17:20:00,10439,  Ya think? The last day of Feb through the 10th of March are gonna be tough.
668547,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-21 17:46:00,10439,  Where ya sittin'? I miss going to Leafs games.  I will be in Tampa in late March and have 7th row tics for the Jets/Bolts game though.    :thumbsup_anim:
668548,tb4me,2012-02-21 17:48:00,3295,Let us Leafers hope Sinclair in our lucky charm!
668551,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-21 17:59:00,2690," If they win this one, we'll all have to chip together for seats for all the rest of the home games for him"
668553,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-21 18:12:00,10439," Yeah, I've never been closer than that so these tics in TB are gonna be a treat!!! PS I'll be there for the warm up, none of this late stuff. Coudn't afford those seats in TO even if you could get 'em."
668562,Lip-ripper,2012-02-21 19:14:00,228," Lucky guy! You get to watch one of the hottest teams in the league right now, and one of the hottest players!  I'm a life long devils fan, I've got to see them a few times already.  Enjoy"
668568,blaque,2012-02-21 19:54:00,2419,Going to the Boston/Buffalo game this friday........FREEBEE lol. Buddies got seasons and wifey cant make it. Hope it s a brew haha
668569,blaque,2012-02-21 19:57:00,2419,"BTW, you guys wanna talk about hard knocks......Im a sabres fan lol. Dismall results this season"
668725,jedimaster,2012-02-22 02:15:00,3472,Sinclair was that you with the cowboy hat and the lollipop dancing? rofl tough game so far. I would love to be watching the winnipeg game at the same time. To be honest if the leafs get knocked out by any team in the NHL I hope its the peggers. WOul dbe a great story to see them in the play offs.  Not that I want the leafs to miss.
668736,jedimaster,2012-02-22 02:34:00,3472,HOLLLLYYY MACANOV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
668739,jedimaster,2012-02-22 02:39:00,3472,OMG
668742,uglyfish,2012-02-22 02:48:00,981,"lol what a joke. good work by the kessel/lupal line. but again, very poor defense.... and by the usual suspects, phaneuf and liles. and of course, gustavsson and his horrible play lets in 3 just plain and simple horrible goals and costs us the game."
667513,Lunatic,2012-02-17 17:42:00,536,How will kessel feel hearing those rumors? I'd think he'd feel just like every other player in the league whose name will pop up somewhere in some rumour.kessel isn't going anywhere.as for the sens I think the only reason why they are now instead of the bottom 3 in the league is the coach. And the reason why leafs are not up a few more spots is because of the coach.
667514,muskymatt,2012-02-17 17:51:00,2608,"Paul Maclean has been a god send for the Sens, all those years with the Detroit org can only be good for you, he's got a lot of respect from the players and the fans."
667516,addy79,2012-02-17 17:59:00,573, well put
667531,Brettiop,2012-02-17 18:58:00,279,"Well i just read the entire thread, couple things   Muskymatt, your a great senstroll...  Im happy with the leafs this season and the direction there headed, i have been alright with nearly every move BB has made since he has been here, and ill be even happier when (if    i hope    i doubt it  ) he fires Wilson  I think we will see a short playoff appearance this season, and next season we will see great improvements and challenge for the 4/5 playoff spots....So many young guys just rounding into form in franson and gardiner, while frattin and colbourne will try to crack into the everyday lineup.  Say what you will, there headed in the right direction in my eyes..."
667538,muskymatt,2012-02-17 19:47:00,2608,  Thank you  it's a tough job but I try my best
667585,Jigger,2012-02-17 22:25:00,1237,"For what its worth, I think that the universe unfolded the way it had to in regards to the Kessel trade. IMO, in order for Seguin to become the player he wanted to be, he had to go to a winner. Am I dissapointed that hes not a Leaf? Sure. But I'm very happy for him that he gets to play on a team that is teaching him how to become that elite level talent everyone thought he would be. I fear that, if he was picked by the Leafs on draft day, he'd still be occupying a spot on the Marlies bus. If for no other reason then Wilsons bi-polarity. Kessel was a proven commodity and seeing (blindly) his team finishing as a middle of the pack team, Burke made the deal that not a lot of GMs would have the gumption to pull off."
667701,bow slayer,2012-02-18 13:01:00,1074,"i am really hoping the leafs just squeek into the playoffs so Wilson gets to keep his job. I also hope they trade away some youth like,Colbourne,Gardiner,Grabovski, Kadri,to pick up some overrated player like say Nash or Carter  just to make the playoffs.   I would also like to see them sign Dion to a nice long extension as well as their current goaltenders"
667720,uglyfish,2012-02-18 15:37:00,981," Lol its funny how everyone is calling for wilsons job even though he has put this team in a playoff position. And its not him on the ice screwing up, its the players. Like phaneuf, liles, grabovski. If theu didn't give the puck away half the time they touch it, they'd be in much better shape"
667809,muskymatt,2012-02-19 02:39:00,2608,"I don't think it's fair how hard the play by play guys are being on the laffs. They sure are bashing them, that's not right, talking about how long it's been since the laffs won in Vancouver and saying this game is an old fashion shellacking....I mean c'mon, itks not like the laffs aren't trying..jeese!!!!"
667810,muskymatt,2012-02-19 02:45:00,2608,"Maybe the laffs do need Nash after all, Alfie never would have let a loss like that happen...seriously though, if that game was a measuring stick for the laffs(or any team for that matter) I'd be worried. Not much you can do against a high flying Canuck team"
667812,uglyfish,2012-02-19 02:50:00,981,"game was pathetic! i cant wait to see who wilson ships outta town, most of this team needs to go, get replaced with guys who have at least an idea of how to play defense, and guys who can play end to end hockey for a full 60 minutes a night!  in any event,  the likely guys that get traded away, will be the wrong players. and he'll keep guys like macarthur, grabovski and phaneuf."
667813,Oggie,2012-02-19 03:04:00,588,They were beat by one of the top three teams so lets not toss them under the bus. I do wonder why they didnt practise for three days. I also wonder why they don't change their style of play depending on who they're playing. Does wilson not dictate the strategy as coach. I think he's lost the respect of the team.
667817,danc,2012-02-19 03:47:00,4677,Hockey?    Whats that? NASCAR is back baby!!!
667818,Live2fish85,2012-02-19 03:49:00,1633,Muskymatt alfie let the leafs beat his team like that last game remember lol thats even worst for your bunch of jokes you call a team.
667825,bassmaster4,2012-02-19 05:12:00,801,oooh lets see if muskymatt can bounce back from that one ahaha
667830,muskymatt,2012-02-19 11:19:00,2608,"For a team that hasn't had a sniff of the playoffs since that win, I'd say that worked out pretty well for the laffs. Sort of a premature eliminatation of sorts....bwahahahahahaha"
667846,Live2fish85,2012-02-19 14:27:00,1633,"I would rather not make it to the playoffs every year then being known for choking in the first round. At least if the sens meet the leafs in the playoffs we know who will choke.  Come on have you really realized yet that your team is a joke and your turning into one. Any one who knows hockey knows your just talking out your ass. 15 years and you have and always will be a joke, trying to rebuild. You say the Sens have been rebuilding for a year lol. Come on face it you have been building for 15 years your team sucks."

667908,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-19 18:50:00,0, you're in luck!
667921,jedimaster,2012-02-19 19:19:00,3472,"I thought according sens fans that the feb 4th game was to be a measuring stick game for the leafs? Oh wait, I forgot that on the 5th it was determined to be too early to tell according to those same sens fans...."
667931,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-19 19:52:00,0,"If 2 seasons after this one pass and the sens are still fighting for 8th, I'm probably gonna be jaded like you guys too!"

668005,tb4me,2012-02-19 23:17:00,3295,Ya got that right Dan..Nascar is back..That race lastnight was nothing short of amazing! Its a shame Kurt Busch had to be taken out by the bonehead Gordon but the way Gordo finished the race it looked good on the twit. Loved seeing that 24 car on its roof. Here's to seeing that alot more this summer!   .That made me forget about my Leafs in a hurry...lol  Go 24 Go! Right on its roof baby!!!
668019,Cookslav,2012-02-19 23:47:00,1457,"To funny... If you guys are SOOOO smart, why are you guys not making it rich on pro Line????   We'll see who's in and who is out shortly.... With 9 points seperating 4th place from 10th I'd say niether team is safe, nor deserving of such staunch defence.  Trade or no trade the Leafs and the Sens had both better toughen up and focus. If I were Burke or Wilson I'd be more interested in sheltering the guys from ""hearing"" the trade rumors then actually dealing...  Last thing they need is pregame jitters..."
667364,muskymatt,2012-02-17 02:57:00,2608," Guess I got caught up in the moment  my bad, still Kessel sucks!  How Ironic it is that you want me to learn to read, when you can't spell...it's Datsyuk, not Datsyk!!  "
667365,muskymatt,2012-02-17 02:59:00,2608,  Ahhhh.... personal attacks will get you no where.
667367,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-17 03:01:00,10439, It will with the Leaf fans.
667370,ctranter,2012-02-17 03:05:00,543,Every year Muskymatt shows up around trade deadline to bash players and be a negative person all around.  Does anyone actually take this guy seriously?  I know I sure don't.   :rofl2:   :clapping:   :rofl2:  :clapping:   :rofl2:
667372,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-17 03:07:00,10439," No, but button pushing is sooooooooooo much fun!!!"
667374,muskymatt,2012-02-17 03:08:00,2608," I wouldn't expect any less but that is not what this thread is about, and not what I'll reduce myself too.  If you can't play nice then don't post"
667392,kickingfrog,2012-02-17 03:42:00,8333,First post:    Are you sure about that? Or is it another one of your facts?
667402,Lunatic,2012-02-17 04:10:00,536,"I think burke is a loud mouth,and his loyalty to wilson is just stupid and insane,but the man can swing a good deal. sens and hab fans are always pointing out kessel,over and over. but fail to point out that we got gardiner and lupul for bauchimin! then he turned brett lebda,a terrible 7th d-man on a bad team into franson and lombardi! seriously,who else could pull this off,we could have got a 7th rd pick for him and been more than happy. he traded kabrele to boston for colboune and a 1st rd pick! GMs will make some bad deals and some good deals,but i can garuntee you, you will not see many more lopsided ones like this in the near future. so you can keep telling us how bad he is and how bad we lost the kessel deal,and completely ignore the killer deals hes been apart of. When it comes to trade rumors or deadlines everyone is waiting to see what burke will do."
667405,Aaron Shirley,2012-02-17 04:15:00,655,"The Leafs will just make the playoffs this year in 8th place. They will then go on to pull off the biggest playoff hockey upset in recent times by beating the Rangers in game 7. They will then go on to win the Stanley Cup.                              Okay you can stop laughing now lol. Seriously, the Leafs are a little better than the past handful of years and should finish the regular season just in or out of a playoff spot, hopefully in for once! They should get a bit better over the next couple of years and be a better team to watch. The team still needs work, but at least they are more pleasurable to watch this year overall. The biggest problem the team has this year is inconsistency. It's been a roller coaster ride for fans."
667407,Aaron Shirley,2012-02-17 04:19:00,655,"Oh, I think Nash is a pipe dream. I am curious to see if Burke will pull a rabbit out of a hat with a blockbuster trade, but I have my doubts about this trade deadline."
667412,johnl,2012-02-17 04:33:00,197,burke sure has made some good deals i hope he can pull something off again we'll see
667417,Live2fish85,2012-02-17 04:57:00,1633,Muskymatt your brain lacks a few cells I think you act like your team has been in a rebuild stage for just a year now. You have been re-building for 15 years with no luck at all.  The leafs may not be a great team but they are still far better then the sens. You talk about Kessel being so garbage yet he is up there with the other high point leaders in the league.  Lets face it. The leafs biggest problem is not there players. Its there coach. Wilson changes the lines like a moron. Burke has actually done something with the team compared to the last 10 years. You have every excuse for your team being a bunch of duds out there.  Your biggest problem is you live to close to Montreal and act like there fans a bunch of k.ow it alls who really don't know crap from clay. My brother in-law is from the area to and is a sens fan as well abd he is a moron to when it comes to hockey. At least us leafs fans can admit that we aren't cheering for some great team but when you guys are a few points ahead you think your some miracle team when your just a bunch of bums.  At least habs fans can say there teams won a bunch of cups.  Now go down to the Parliament Buildings then proceed to the kitty hotel and pet the cats that are loser like the other sens fans and cheer up.
667421,muskymatt,2012-02-17 05:24:00,2608,Wow. LoL I don't even know how to reply to that..lol  How about those Leafs eh?
667424,Lunatic,2012-02-17 05:36:00,536,"im gonna have to agree on the wilson thing. he is mind numbing to watch.they talk about needing to work harder on the boards,we get armstrong back from injury and he scratches him??? schenn sitting while komi plays?? a PK in the last 2 min of a game and komi is on the ice? puts 4th liners on the ice against 1st liners when a face-off is in our zone? mis-uses his time outs.  also speaking of great deals how is anderson doing? or gomez? markov?  people need to look at their own teams failures before you get on kessels case"
667462,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-17 14:43:00,0, 5th for wins in the nhl.
667465,Live2fish85,2012-02-17 15:02:00,1633,"Wildon is a complete moron. He is a great coach when he has a team full of veterans, but with the young guys hes a moron. He changes up the lines constantly like breaking apart Lupul and kessel when they are the best pair the tem has. He needs to understand that they will make mistakes and more if they keep changin lines.  As for the leafs and how they are doing. Well I would say they are doing crap like the Sens as they are both in the bottom of playoff spots.  Atleast if the leafs get to the playoffs they won't choke like the sens are known for."
667468,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-17 15:16:00,0,"i wondered why leaf fans cling to this ""sens choking"" thing but then i realize that it's because they are the last team the leafs beat in a playoff series (almost a decade ago)...  so what does this mean, that the leafs CHOKE in the regular season?"

667496,muskymatt,2012-02-17 16:56:00,2608,"LOL That's funny  As an ex leaf fan, I have to wonder what is in Burks head. I read in the Sun this morning that TML may actually be considering a Nash trade for Kessel and another player. Didn't Burke just trade the whole future away for Kessel? And now he's considering trading the guy he traded it all away for? It makes no sense whatsoever! How is Kessel going to feel hearing these rumors, and how will it affect his play if the trade doesn't go through. Wow, talk about creating a negative atmosphere. I'm hoping the Sens sit this trade deadline out, or at least keep it to getting rid of a few down the list guys for future considerations.  IMO, Burke is not doing the fans or the team any good with this."
667498,[email protected],2012-02-17 17:00:00,119," much like opponents of the Leafs cling to the Kessel trade ?? Some people.......... Leaf fans are REAL FANS, we don't flip teams when we hit a rough patch.  the ones that do flip, were never REAL FANS to begin with."
667502,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-17 17:05:00,2690,"  Yeah, that's the one"

667275,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-17 00:05:00,0,"i think you misunderstood what he meant matt.  he was suggesting that pavel datsyuk plays the game on a higher level like gretz or #4, and i definitely agree with him."
667276,Jer,2012-02-17 00:09:00,1426,  But don't you see? That's what you're missing as a Sens fan...the passion.
667277,muskymatt,2012-02-17 00:11:00,2608,"  Datsyuk absolutely, best skilled player in the game today, aside from maybe Crosby. Kessle isn't even in the same league and is NOT a well rounded player, his offensive game can be good at times(I'll give him that) but back checking, defensively and hitting, he's got a lot to do to fill those categories."
667278,muskymatt,2012-02-17 00:12:00,2608,"  Deal, and I'll sport my Sens jersey"
667279,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-17 00:13:00,0,"are we having a discussion now or are you just going to call the sens the senoritas and name call my response.   he has set you back by trying to rush a rebuild through free agency and the kessel trade.  what has resulted is a mediocre hockey team with very little moveable assets, the most over-rated coach in the game, and no bonafide superstars in your prospect pool.  in a few years, when all of burke's short term deals expire, and all you top picks play for boston, you'll see what i mean."

As was my point, aside from the kessel trade, which was covered above, what has Burke done that hasn't been positive? going from avg age of 35-36 to current avg of what 23-25?  adding upgrades to our team by getting rid of dead weight contracts from Fergusons days, please enlighten me. yes the senoritas."

667325,muskymatt,2012-02-17 01:37:00,2608,"  Actually, last year was when the Senators started dumping has beens and their salaries, so with that in mind, I would say the rebuild started at that point or even at the draft.  Leaf Fact #1  2014(just 2 yrs) will mark 10 years without a laff playoff visit"
667343,kickingfrog,2012-02-17 02:12:00,8333, Your fact is based on a 2 season projection and a lock-out.
667361,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-17 02:52:00,10439," You Ottawa fans don't know how to read English do you Matt? I said that Datsyk is, not Kessel. I'm saying that Kessel isn't.  Maybe you could learn the English language during the off season while your precious Senators are pitching and putting while the Leafs are playing in the 1st round of the playoffs."
667363,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-17 02:55:00,10439,  Exactly!!! Ottawa fans are a little light in the cognitive skills area. I probably should have drawn him stick figures or used puppets just for young Mathiew. He never was the sharpest pencil in the box.
667219,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-16 22:15:00,0," i didn't say they WOULD trade any of our assets... but we have blue chip prospects both on the team, in the ahl, and in juniors.. the leafs, contrary to what the toronto based media tells you, do not.  which is what happens when you piss all your picks away on a one dimensional scorer."

By chance do you know the definition of insanity...lol    I don't want him in Ottawa, we've got depth everywhere and being in year 1 of our ""rebuild"", things are looking good for this and the years to come.  I'm a sens fan(ex laffs fan) and am proud of it, years of watching that circus almost put me off hockey, and what they did to Sittler was pathetic.  Short of the last couple years(which are looking better) the Sens have had an outstanding record over the last 15yrs....can you say that?"
667231,muskymatt,2012-02-16 22:37:00,2608," Correct, but who would have known Redden would tank like he did. I'm just thankful the Rangers are paying his salary for the next 4yrs while he plays in the minors."
667238,[email protected],2012-02-16 22:54:00,119," last 15 yrs in playoffs, when it matters, I would say, yes, vs Ottawa I CAN say that.....  I would say good luck to you going forward, but apparently your team is just too good/skilled/young/talented to need it.  It's too funny how everyone in Canada is jealous of Toronto, in general, and it always comes through sports. I guess I would be too, if I lived in butthurtville.  Good luck in your many fights on the Internet tonight....... I hope you win many arguments over the internet tonight."

667242,[email protected],2012-02-16 22:59:00,119, Do YOU follow hockey at all ? Kessel is VERY well balanced...30 goals - 32 assists.  One dimensional is more appropriate as far as your views go....
667245,[email protected],2012-02-16 23:00:00,119,Leafs > Senoritas.......... end of story.

667259,[email protected],2012-02-16 23:45:00,119,"Don't forget Seguin is technically a leftover, Edmonton took Hall 1st if I recall, neither is a bad choice, but comparing them to Kessel at the time of the deal, us beyond idiotic.  They could have/maybe will become a bust. Hard to call Kessel a bust."

667266,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-16 23:54:00,10439, That's like saying Bobby Orr or Wayne Gretzky is my definition of a well rounded player. Pavel is probably the best player in the league right now and all others are rated lower. IMHO Kessel is an excellent player but not quite in that league.   The Leafs have some good talent on their squad. Early season I said that the biggest issue they had at the time was the PK. Well now the PK is awesome but goal tending has not been the same since Reimer got run in the crease and suffered his concussion. I think if the goal tending were to be brought in line with the way the rest of the team is playing we would be in a much better place.
667270,[email protected],2012-02-16 23:58:00,119," nobody cares about Boston, this is mostly about the Senoritas, who will be watching Canada's real team, Toronto, in the playoffs.   Even better would be a matchup with them IN the playoffs, easy way for Toronto to advance........."

Yeah compare Gretz to Kessel   :w00t:  I'm glad Gretz kicked your a$$   in the playoffs, silly leafs. When will they learn  :stretcher:"
667273,[email protected],2012-02-17 00:05:00,119,"Doc, how has Burke set us back ?? I've asked that many times, and never gotten more than Kessel for picks.....um, POTENTIAL talent for proven talent, most agree it's a non issue. aside from Komi, he traded away dead weight, older players, to obtain young, fast talent.  How does this set you back further than staying with status quo. It's not like Burke walked into an all star team roster."
667274,tb4me,2012-02-17 00:05:00,3295,"you are one funny dude, ill give you that...If I ever go on a charter with you im wearing my leafs gear...lol"
667091,muskymatt,2012-02-16 16:53:00,2608,"Nash for kessles and phanuf, straight up!!! Eh? Eh!  LoL  The laffs would probably have to add a couple first round picks also as Kessels and Phanuf are kind of weak trades for a guy like Nash.  I bet Burky is working on it right now.  LoL"
667095,tb4me,2012-02-16 17:03:00,3295,Billy Waters is saying Nash for Kessel strait up...Where do you get you info? If I trust anyone its Billy W. He knows his stuff. He also said Bruke isint interested. I say send schenn Kadri and Phaneuf for Nash. Now thats a deal
667096,Lip-ripper,2012-02-16 17:05:00,228,Nash is overrated. He's never even had an 80 point season. I don't blame Columbus for trying to deal him. It'll be interesting to see where he ends up.
667097,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-16 17:06:00,0,"i'm interested to see what moves burke will make.  he has some prospects to move, but not many, so a trade for rick nash means they are going for it now, and 5 years from now could be a scary time for the leafs.  truthfully i think carter is more likely than nash but that's just because he's playing poor and the price might be more acceptable to burke."
667098,[email protected],2012-02-16 17:11:00,119,"at least the Leafs have assets to trade, unlike say, Ottawa.  Nobody aside from a third rate city wants Krusty the clown on their team, let alone as captain.  That's the biggest joke......"
667099,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-16 17:15:00,0," do you even watch hockey?  the sens prospect pool is teeming with talent for the future.  unless you're not impressed by the likes of mika zibanejad or mark stone.  in which case, you're an idiot."

667108,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-16 17:33:00,2690,"  I don't like that one...other than getting rid of Komisarek.  Grabovski has been the Leafs most consistent player this year, I still wouldn't give up on Schenn, and Kadri won't get a fair shake from coach Wilson. Anyone else was coaching he'd be in the line up, IMO. The Leafs are still light years away from winning the cup, they are a young team...DO NOT trade away the future like so many managers have done in the past."
667112,Raf,2012-02-16 17:39:00,3495, exactly!
667116,tb4me,2012-02-16 17:41:00,3295,further to that Nash not at practice today???? Hmm
667118,uglyfish,2012-02-16 17:44:00,981,"Nope. Don't like that deal at all. Grabovski I would trade, his value is high right now, and u can get a much better, more complete player for him in return. Kadri has scary talent that once harrnessed and he learns all aspects of the game, will be a dynamite player. Schenn is only young still, and a solid defensive D man, he's still learning and will only get better, komisarek is a solid defensive D man as well, blocks a ton of shots, and is strong on guys along the boards, clears the front of the net. I'd move phaneuf, or gunnarsson before schenn or komi."
667122,Lip-ripper,2012-02-16 17:52:00,228,"Leaf fans crack me up. Don't give up on Schenn... Kadri won't get a fair shake... lol The Toronto media has Leaf fans so brainwashed into thinking that their prospects are the next big thing. Fact is, most of these guys will develop into 3rd or 4th line guys at best. The truth hurts...  Remember these guys? Alyn Macauley...Sergei Berezin... Carla Colaiacavo...Matt Stajan...Drake Berehowsky... Alex Steen...  Shall I go on?"
667128,tb4me,2012-02-16 18:16:00,3295,"your 100% right..Its too bad the toronto media couldnt brainwash the rest of the league into beliving half the crap leaf fans belive. Schenn is good trade bait..Kadri, I wouldnt waste another minute of game time on him. Send him away while you can still get somthing in return. as for Komi I agree with others he is a great palyer. Grabs is a great player, but if you can get the likes of Nash back for those 3 guys, I say go for it!!As for Willy sitting komi and Army I just cant get my head around that..Sit the only 2 vetrans we have..Way to go Wilson..Smart move bringing them back into the game!"
667129,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-16 18:25:00,390,"Yep get what you can for Kadri - a potential career minor leaguer. Gabowski is unrestricted at the end of the season so could be gone anyway so get what you can. Remember our hero Sundin as he left after his contract expired and signed with Vancouver, Leafs go squat.  Regardless of Nash in the lineup, Leafs are not getting past first round without a goalie. Probably won't make the playoffs with who they have in net now."
667137,muskymatt,2012-02-16 18:40:00,2608,"Wow, just a couple weeks ago you guys were talking about playoffs, now you're ready to pull the carpet out from under the team. Bottom line is Kessel was expensive to get(all those picks) and is not a franchise player, his personality sucks and you can't build a tam around that. Phanuf is so bad even his own team mates don't like his attitude, let alone the rest of the league. With no depth in the draft or minors, the laffs will have to trade to go any where and with what's on the table now, other teams won't touch them. So the hero(Burke) the laffs brought in to save the day has actually screwed it up so bad, players won't want to come to TO to play. My bet is the Laffs are in for a long, rough, sucking rebuild. Keep on buying those tickets though, funny how the hockey center of the universe is actually a black hole of garbage and bad moves!!!  Bwahahahahahaa"
667140,BillM,2012-02-16 18:46:00,17367,"Sounds like a lot people in here should give up their day jobs and become NHL team managers.  Easy to sit back and yap on a internet fishing forum, lol!"
667142,Mike Pike,2012-02-16 18:48:00,1332,"Fact is Leafs have the youngest team in the league and are currently holding down a play-off spot, with some depth in the minors finally.  Lots of upside to this year's team, so whatever Burke is able to do, it will likely be with their future success in mind, as opposed to emmidiate returns for the remainder of this year."
667145,[email protected],2012-02-16 19:02:00,119," And if you think Ottawa is going to trade them, I think idiocy may fall on your end."
667176,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-16 20:23:00,390," I've been a fan for over 40 years but a realistic one, haven't said anything regarding the ""P"" word this year. Except in this thread and them not making it with the current goaltender situation. The result of the Kessel deal can't be determined for a couple years, his personality and other non-hockey traits are a result of his youth. Even though Phaneuf doesn't win ""Most Popular"", where the dressing room stands now is light years ahead of where Ferguson had it. The worst seed in that room was Jason Blake and we are a far better team now with that negativity and bad attitude gone."

667192,Lunatic,2012-02-16 21:23:00,536,"I've been wanting nash for years! They want a young roster player a couple of prospects and picks. I'd offer schenn only because we need to unload some money to get Nash and no way they will take Komi,I'd also offer kadri, and either gunner or blacker and then a first pick. We would probably need a toss in with Nash to even this out a tad. I'd do everything in my power to resign grabo.as you can tell as a leaf fan my armchair GM skills are intact haha. I did however read somewhere that CLB would demand gardiner as apart of the package, if this was the case I'd walk away from this trade, defenceman like him don't come around too often. I wouldn't be happy about colbourne going either."
667193,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-16 21:28:00,2690,  BINGO!!  Let's hope Burke isn't that foolish!!
667196,jedimaster,2012-02-16 21:29:00,3472,"Grabo was MIA for the first 30 games.He has come on lately. as for kadri, komi I would consider these guys write off's Kadri just doesn't have the hockey sense. He has skills but no hockey brain on the ice. He could very well become a solid top line wing man or a never was in the minors. I would give up those three guys for Nash no problem. As for Schenn I would like to see him stick around. so it comes down to Grabo(a ufa) and Schenn(an unknown yet to be developed d man) for Nash.  Nash Turns 28 this summer  Nash and grabo are both on pace for the same stats, 8 more goals and 10 more assists.  Nash is doing these stats with first line minutes and grabo is doing it with second line minutes. I am not saying grabo is better but these are the numbers.  Is nash going to have better chemistry with 20 games remaining than grabo? I don't think so. Not to mention you have to recover the minutes that Schenn puts in. Who do you put in his place?  A deal for Nash is NOT a deal to make a push. Its a deal to build a better team over the next five years. The reality is that with any of these guys the leafs are still missing a number 1 goalie, as neither reimer or gustav have stepped up....AND.... most importantly they still don't have a top line center. I think it would be one heck of a line having Kessle and Nash on the top line with lupal dropping down to the second line to replace grabo. but this will screw with whatever chemistry there is currently. Still short that big line center.  Either way a deal for nash is a deal for next year or the year after. A deal for a goalie is a deal for the play offs. To be honest what team other than Boston have the leafs not been able to skate with and gun with toe to toe this year? Even short a big time center the leafs can skate with any team in the league. They need a big team center to shore everything up and add the consistency, and they need to figure out the goal tending situation. What are they going to do in the play-offs? Play rock paper scissors for starting goalie?  I am happy with the team as a whole, but we are still missing some key components, and as much as I like Nash, he is not the component we are missing. We already have three 30 goal wingers that haven't accomplished anything.  Don't forget... Nash is a -22 this year and grab is a +5 with the same goals and assists."
667198,BillM,2012-02-16 21:32:00,17367,No need to fix things if they aren't broke.  The Leafs are just fine with the way things are.
