671968,HTHM,2012-03-02 00:07:00,4082,"I have been put in charge of arranging a team building exercise/fishing trip for my division at work. It will consist of myself, two female co-workers AND our spouses, (don't get any ideas...)  :jerry:  Time frame, July - early September and it would be mid-week Wendsday - Friday. What I am looking for is a place suitable for a Ranger Bass boat, good accommodations, possible boat rental, and within an hour of Ottawa or other place that is easy to fly (commercially) into. Any suggestions are welcome, and species does not matter. Probably pan fish is what we will be catching. Thanks in advance"
