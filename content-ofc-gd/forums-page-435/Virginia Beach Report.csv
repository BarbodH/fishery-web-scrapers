670726,lovetofish,2012-02-28 14:25:00,500,"We got out to the hut at 7:30am, fishing started off a little slow.  But the bite just kept getting better and better as the day went on, by 9am they were on fire.  I think a few things helped to contribute to our success, having the big hole and being able to see the fishing coming and sending a block of dead minnows under the hut.  The Hole:  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-02-05130322.jpg  We found using 3"" williams spoons would bring the fish in and the aggressive fish would hit the spoon and using a drop shot setup with a minnow would get the fish that weren't interested in the spoon.  We talked to a lot of other guys and the fishing seemed to be pretty slow for everyone.  Being able to see the fish that well, you learn so much!  It was the best day of perchin we ever had as far as size and numbers!  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-01-28171918.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-02-25165223.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-02-25170838.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-02-25182523.jpg http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-01-31191703.jpg   Thanks to the everyone on the board for all the information that led to us putting our hut out at Virginia Beach!
