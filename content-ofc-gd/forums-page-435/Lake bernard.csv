We mainly target Ling at night, but have caught some monster lakers out of there!!...There is also perch, rainbow trout (not common) and bass.  If you can get out front of High Rock you will se the shanty town, the locals have pinpointed some of the best structure on the lake.  Good Luck if you get out!!!"
671680,adempsey,2012-03-01 02:34:00,1498,Turns out I am heading back up there this weekend =).   Hopefully we don't get blown across the lake!  The weather forecast isn't looking too good for Saturday =(  Sent you a PM Rolly.   Was hoping for some Ling tips!
