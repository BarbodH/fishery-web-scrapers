671010,lakemaster,2012-02-28 23:23:00,36, Thank u for your info. I was thinking their was going to be Lakers aswell. But ohwell walleye is good enough
671054,steelhedrmatt,2012-02-29 01:06:00,278,"Straight across from your work is a rock face with alot of grafitti on it.  usually good for a fish or two.  about half way to that rock face, is the deepest part of the lake, gets to about 110'. its more like a crater. always mark fish there but can never get them to go.  seen some people fishing it on Saturday, but i was doing about 120kph taking the D123 shortcut on the sled, so i never stopped to see if they were catching.  BTW the link posted is some close friends' resort.  Doug and Susan are great people, and Doug really knows the lake."
