671752,Billy Bob,2012-03-01 12:43:00,5865," Yet there were several freight cars that were made out of aluminium and again NO WELDING on safety appliances. Welding is not to be trusted when you have a man hanging off the side of a car, but rivets or bolts were."
671753,Old Man,2012-03-01 12:44:00,822," As per my last post. Different vehicles, different operating parameters. Freight car doesn't = boat anymore than Tractor = boat."
671755,Billy Bob,2012-03-01 12:54:00,5865, I am referring to SAFETY standards....welding is not a acceptable means when it comes to personal safety and it didn't matter what material we were working with.
671756,Old Man,2012-03-01 12:55:00,822, I you want to talk about safety. Riveted aluminum aircraft are responsible for many human deaths due to metal fatigue that started at rivet holes. The most famous example of this would be the De Havilland Comet crashes of 1954. Again should riveted boat owner worry? No. Should welded boat owners worry? No.
671759,solopaddler,2012-03-01 13:02:00,8605,Alrighty then. I think we can add riveted vs welded to the long list of OFC hot button topics right up there with tiller vs console.   
671760,Roy,2012-03-01 13:07:00,13728,Right up there with whether or not it's legal to photograph a fish. Usually the obscure fishing regulation questions are the trigger for everyone to start prepping their boats for the softwater season. We've got it down to an art Mike. Who needs the groundhog.
671833,moemoe,2012-03-01 16:44:00,352,"welds vs rivets, cracked vs popped, one of the coolest things at the spring boat shot was seening the video of the lund with no drain plug and 20 3-4 inch holes drilled in it, and still driving due to the flotation properties of the boat, point is you can still get back to the boat launch"

671909,fishnsled,2012-03-01 20:21:00,3520,"Well since everyone has an opinion, here is mine. My previous tinny was riveted as were my buddies. All different makes and all had rivets come loose or fall out. When up grading a buddy of mine went for a cracker, a year later I got a Crestliner 1750. His boat was nothing but trouble from day one and to the point where he got rid of it and went to a fiberglass hull, fed up with aluminum hulls altogether.  This will be my 10 season with mine and other then some livewell pump problems it's been a good boat for keeping the water out. To answer your original question Lunker777, I'd say it's a good boat at a good price. I'd buy another Crestliner but wouldn't cross a riveted hull off the list. It will come down to the layout, storage, and price the next time around."
671958,Old Man,2012-03-01 23:54:00,822," Terry, did you actually read this line in my post?????  ""I'm talking about tractors and cultivators which have just about as much in common with boats as freight cars and airplanes do. ""  I guess my Avatar is spot on in this case."
671970,Terry,2012-03-02 00:09:00,14456,"and I read that to mean tractors and cultivators have as much in common with boats have as much in common with boat as freight cars and airplanes do tractors and cultivators have as much in common with boats as freight cars and airplanes do the separator seems to be boats, so I read it as none of the above have anything in common with boats  I can only read your post and not your mind or intent"

Lots of well respected members here with positive things to say about Crestliner. However when I posed the same question last month I had several members pm me telling me to avoid Crestliner.  Sometimes you just have to take all the info you've got and go with your gut."
671558,NANUK,2012-02-29 22:24:00,797,"Crestliner has awesome warranty and customer servive, And that is my PERSONAL EXPERIENCE !! They looked after my warranty issue no questions asked and very quick. I use my Fish Hawk 1650 on Lk Ontario all summer plus trailor it all over southern Ontario, been in pretty rough waters, no hull cracking issues what so ever. I bought it for fishing and I make full use of it, but I don't abuse it. Any hull will split and rivits will pop if you abuse it or don't know how to drive it, every vessel has its limitations, boat, car truck or even a tank, know your limits and use accordingly. AS for fishability, one of the best layout in 16' class IMO, modified V hull (13* deadrise). 87"" beam, one of the biggest front casting decks I have seen in a 16"", easy to launch, easy to tow(2000 lb package). handles big water with ease yet I can fish the slop in 18 inches of water. You won't be sorry, Like making any other major purchase, Check for warranties across the border, make sure you get the motor you want and it comes with a good make & proper size trailer."
671563,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-29 22:35:00,10439," Yep ,exactly!!! Most of the less expensive welded aluminum hulls are using much thinner aluminum stock that is easily over heated when welding. This over heating weakens the area next to the weld and it is more prone to crack."
671568,Old Man,2012-02-29 22:45:00,822,Bottom of a Harbercraft is 1.4 mm thicker than the Crestliner and the sides are 0.3 mm thicker.
671577,Radnine,2012-02-29 23:04:00,1538," I think is just confused, the post asked for Crestliner owners. And where has anybody been to see three of anything, let alone three boats ""split open"". It is a fantastic boat at at fantastic price. Do yourself a favour and PM Bernie on this board, that is if his head hasn't split open from listening to morons bash the boats he sells. Jim"
671580,Old Man,2012-02-29 23:09:00,822," All I can say is that I am a Crestliner owner. and if Lunker can pick that rig up for what he's been quoted, then it's a great deal that he won't regret."
671582,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-29 23:13:00,10439,"Not bashing Crestliner at all. Just letting the OP know of a possible concern with welded hulls on lighter guage aluminum boats of all makes. Not saying it will crack at all, just something to take into consideration is all."
671585,Terry,2012-02-29 23:19:00,14456,"there is a reason why planes are riveted and not wielded and it makes sense for boats for all the same reasons..I will go with riveted boats, unless it's one hell of a deal"
671586,Old Man,2012-02-29 23:26:00,822," Funny, at one time planes were made out of wood and fabric, and now most modern aircraft are constructed from composites. So maybe all our boats should be made of composites now."

671601,Terry,2012-02-29 23:59:00,14456, lots of them are composites now  I know people who have had great like with wielded boats but I know people who have had nightmares with them some companies were great about repairing them..but they lost half the summer or more getting them repaired  most rivet repairs can be done in a day...... everyone will love one or the other and will swear by the one they love and no amount of facts will change their mind... I think you and I fit into that category
671611,Tybo,2012-03-01 00:15:00,1373,I was just wondering where do most of the welded boats crack?
671614,Old Man,2012-03-01 00:23:00,822," I don't know, I'll let you know when mine cracks.  That's if I make it back to shore."
671616,dave524,2012-03-01 00:29:00,4508," Drifter explained exactly like a friends Crestliner cracked, the welds themselves are fine , they crack immmediately adjacent to the welds. This friend was also a multi ticketed maintenance welder at a Hamilton steel mill, excess heating of the material was his best guess at the cause."

As I mentioned, its my second one, so I must like it.  If you have a choice, check out the Northern Package vinyl floor as mentioned previously, easy to keep clean and durable."
671653,Tybo,2012-03-01 02:03:00,1373,I meant on the boat.Is it a general area or do they randomly crack where they have been welded.There not all the same grade of aluminium.
671677,Sinker,2012-03-01 02:31:00,8692," Yup, your right. I'm a confused moron.  I'm only telling you what I've seen. Have you heard of any other brand of boats that split open?? (other than tracker) I'm not bashing Crestliner, I'm just not a fan of welded hulls. Period. I wouldn't buy a welded anything unless the metal was thick enough to safely weld without having to worry about it splitting open.   Buy whatever brand you want, I'm just telling you what I know. While your pm'ing Bernie, ask him how many he's seen come back for warranty work.   S."

671745,Billy Bob,2012-03-01 11:29:00,5865,"Later this month my riveted Grumman will be 27 years old and still going strong......she has see a LOT of Lake Erie and Ontario....I knew 2 guys with Crestliners and as far as I know they didn't have any problems and they spent at least the same amount on Lake Erie....one did have a rotten floor....  Now getting back to welding vs rivets...  I worked on the railroad for 30 years....one of my jobs was to repair damaged freight cars in our shop or out on the tracks where they stood....we could weld just about anything EXCEPT safety appliances....like ladders, hand hold, sill steps, running boards etc....those had to be riveted or bolted....NO WELDING WHATSOEVER as per FRA Standards and it's the same in Canada...so think out that...."
671747,Old Man,2012-03-01 12:09:00,822,"Funny, when I farmed, the frame of my 835 Versatile Tractor was welded together. So was the frame and hitch of the 36 ft of Morris deep tiller I pulled with it. But then again I'm talking about tractors and cultivators which have just about as much in common with boats as freight cars and airplanes do. So think that out.        "
671748,Billy Bob,2012-03-01 12:24:00,5865,The big difference is SAFETY....your hitch breaks off you have to go back and get it....a grab handle or ladder breaks off the side of a box car the man could be killed. When it comes to safety the FRA takes it VERY serious and that is why those standards are in place.  BTW my boat the GRUMMAN is built by a manufacture that builds planes....many help us win WWII....
671750,Fisherman,2012-03-01 12:38:00,7201," Funny, haven't seen too many aluminum tractors or ploughs lately.  Different metal, different properties."
671751,Old Man,2012-03-01 12:38:00,822," Yes, Grumman also built the Lunar Landers for the Apollo missions. My point is that talking about materials and construction methods for different applications is pointless. You know one of the reasons for the shift away from riveted aircraft aluminum to composites in airplane construction is due to the fact that every hole drilled for a rivet on an aircraft skin is a potential weak point. In many cases where aircraft have experience problems with metal fatigue it almost always starts with hairline cracks at the rivets. That said, does this mean that riveting aluminum is a bad way to build a boat? No, it isn't, because the two vehicle operate under and in a totally different environment and method."

Dealer said he would do it for $16500, and that would be delivery to the border. I would have to take it from there and pay the taxes and what not.  Any one have any input on this particular boat ? On crestliners in general ? Is this a good deal ???  Thanks"
670954,landry,2012-02-28 21:37:00,1005,"That is a great boat and a great deal - I think they go for around 21,000 here plus taxes. Duty will be 13% plus 200 for trailer fee (RIV) I say go for it:)  I have owned 2 of these with side console and 75hp on them - great layout and will hit 40 mph with just me and fishing stuff, high 30's otherwise. What motor is on it - that will affect pricing. Get him to swap the troll motor for a 70 - 80 lb thrust model and pay the difference. The 55lb will not pull this boat in any wind - you will thank me for that one - been there, done that.  Landry"
670957,NANUK,2012-02-28 21:48:00,797,Good deal if the motor is 4 stroke. not so great with a 2 stk. Another thing to consider is what size & make trailer does it come with? Ideally You need a minimum 2000 lb trailer under that boat when fully loaded. don't forget you still have to pay taxes & duties to bring it accross the border.
670958,BillM,2012-02-28 21:49:00,17367,Michigan is a non-title state for boats under 20ft.   Make sure he provides all the proper documentation or else you won't be bringing that boat back over the border.

A few small issues with livewell and bildge pumps - but I think that had something to do with the previous owner.   I would agree with the recommendation to upgrade the trolling motor though - i have 55# unit on mine and while it will move the boat in calm conditions - if there's any wind to speak of its not much good. I'm in the process of upgrading mine right now to an 80# unit.

Guess I'm lucky. I also wasn't aware that it takes a full year to resolve a warranty issue with Crestliner. You obviously have personal experience with them.

I know Crestliners are nice boats, I'm just not sold on welded aluminum on any boat.  I have had no personal experience dealing with crestliner, but have several friends who have. They were all resolved, but took a long time to be completed. One buddy had no boat for  most of the softwater season, and his boat split open in the fall.
