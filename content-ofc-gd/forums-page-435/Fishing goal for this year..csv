671738,MichaelAngelo,2012-03-01 07:11:00,65, Such an epic story.  How much $$ does a trip like that run?
671770,Acountdeleted,2012-03-01 13:45:00,2562,"Last year me and my buddy missed our Kawartha fishing trip so my goal this year is to get back out for that, hopefully we can break our softwater curse and actually land some walleye or bass this year.  I've lived a pretty charmed (albeit short) fishing career due to being able to spend a few years in Northern Ontario so size and number arn't really goals for me. That being said I'd love a weekend to be able to head back up to Thunder Bay to do some fishing, so I guess I'll add that to my list.  Oh, and there was a river just outside of Goderich I've been meaning to fish for 2 years now. This year I want to get in for the spring to land some of the walleye that were packed into there.  I'd love to catch a Salmonid over 2 pounds though that may be a bucket list thing rather then a this year goal."
671791,MichaelAngelo,2012-03-01 14:44:00,65, Hahaha all you have to do is head to a trib during a salmon run =P   
671798,Acountdeleted,2012-03-01 15:00:00,2562,  Salmonids don't like me for some reason. I don't know why but I just can't seem to catch them.

I am heading to lake of the woods so I am hoping I can get these on the same trip. I also would like to spend 10+ days outside of my trip chasing ski's closer to home. I would also like to break the 40"" or 30lb barrier for salmon. However those are just numbers that are somewhat irrelevant as my most important goal is to get out with my brother in law at least twice and maybe convince my father in law to go fishing for the first time in years. For some reason I think that a few days fishing with these two guys would mean more to me than a new PB. One of these years I will also make time to go visit my bro and put the custom fly rod that he built me to work on the bow river."

671012,Handlebarz,2012-02-28 23:25:00,3790,  Cliff that was dads dream and one of the very few things we did not do was a fly in fishing trip we have been to many lakes north of Sudbury with fly in quality but he always looked at the fly in place along HWY 144 when we would be heading north and say one of these days. It never happened and when I tried to get him for one 2007 after our may 24 trip he did not want to leave mom at home with out himself so if you have the chance this year just do it.

I hope smallies will be nice to me this year.  A first 5+ LMB would be nice too.  Hooking and finally landing a Simcoe 6+ will be another goal.

671736,RSF,2012-03-01 06:13:00,47,"A couple of fishing budys and I once had the chance to fish Moon River. When we arrived, the man in charge of the marina said there was a man down on the docks with the local press about to take a picture of a possible record breaker--Musky.  Of course we ran down to see the fish and it was huge. He had trouble holding the fish up past his waiste (chained) for the picture. If I remember correctly, it rang in at forty-seven pounds. It's eyes were deep black and as big as ours.  He caught it top water trolling using large suick, dark in color with an orange belly Near the boat he said it broke water, breaking his rod (and it sure was shattered mid-point) and had to complete the catch with just the reel and reel mount are of what rod he had left. See: http://bigwoodmuskylures.com/lures.php?cat=jerkbaits&make=Suick  Needless to say, we were there for three days and camped on an island--no one would go in the water after seeing that monster, lol.  Anyway, I, having caught only two 6 lb (20 min apart(immediately released)) muskies in all the years I fished, my goal is to catch a monster this year. I think I will use top running musky spinners or perhaps a suick? Probably fishing Buckhorn or Pidgeon lakes?"

670279,RSF,2012-02-27 09:09:00,47,"  Depends on what I'm fishing for of course, but for bass--a wobble frog or green spinner baited with a slashed minnow. I generally don't do a lot of largemouth bass fishing unless I'm throwing them back (too many parasites--lol).  Generally, I fish walleye, smallmouth, pike and musky. Stream fishing for trout, I have never used anything other than a Panther Martin with yellow body orange dotted w/a #3 trebble hook tri-sharpened. The best stream trout lure I have ever used.  I'd be quite interested in any tips you could give re jig types and jigging techniques? I'm awfull at jigging and would like to learn how to actaully catch something using a jig."

I also want to catch my first resident trout, my family has a 100 acre propery in grey county with the rocky saugeen flowing through it, and after about 15 years of camping up there ive still never been able to trick one of these gems.

Prior to last year, I had rarely used anything outside of hard plastic lures.  With that said, I am hoping to continue improving my soft plastic skills as well as learning to fish bass jigs better.  I think I have caught all of 3 fish on bass jigs in my life.  I also want to keep a better, more detailed fishing log."

I always seem to be working around the house too much and end up not getting out on the water. I want to get into my goto pike ice fishing lake during open water so I can slay a bunch of giant gators on the fly too. Another goal that I hope to acomplish on my vacation in less than a month is to land a 70#+ Tarpon on a centerpin setup. And get a bunch of good HD video of the accomplishment.   :thumbsup_anim:

I would love to have a float plane pick us up here at my dock on Sturgeon Lake. Fly my son (and/or) daughter and I to some spectacular ""fly-in-only"" lake for trout or walleye (don't really care which, numbers more than size).  Have a camp for us to stay in (and the camp doesn't have to be fancy, just comfortable) with a guide and cook (could be one in the same) so all we have to do is relax, fish, eat, and enjoy. At the end of our trip, have the plane fly us back here and drop us off at our dock. (or perhaps pick up and drop the kids off at points in between)."
