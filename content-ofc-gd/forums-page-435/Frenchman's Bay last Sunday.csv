670886,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-28 18:13:00,65,"I spent 2 hours at Frenchman's bay last Sunday because I was in the area. I started fishing the public docks at the base of Liverpool road.  Ice: the ice has set in around most of the shallow areas. You're limited to fishing at the docks really.     I started by working a red devil spoon along the bottom parallel to all the docks, taking care to not come close to the dock edges and spooking any fish. No luck after about an hour.  I switched to a rapala size 7 shad crankbait (silver/black). I worked the slowly around the middle of the water around the bridge and along the docks as well. Nothing.     Then I took a stroll down the east and west paths at the base of Liverpool road. The east one brings you alongside the shallow wetland that's iced over. The west one brings you to a ""no trespassing"" gate. Has that gate ever been opened? It gives you access to all the deeper water!  I did get scared by a huge beaver that surfaced just next to me by the docks though. And I got a nice sunset. Nevertheless, I wish there were fish!"
670929,Homer Is King,2012-02-28 20:05:00,305,Thanks for the update.  I work near there and tried it a couple of times last year.  Same results as you!  Plan to head out there again soon!
670930,Harrison,2012-02-28 20:11:00,2202,Some of my best childhood memories were at the bottom of liverpool rd fishing at the bridge with my Dad in March for Pike.  He would stop at Rerries on the way home from the hall and have the minnows there ready for when we got home from school.  It looks like it is pretty hard to fish there now.  Used to be a great little spot.  Suprised you didn't get yelled at fishing near those docks.
670940,EC1,2012-02-28 20:54:00,930,Thanks a bunch for the update! Will be going out for pike there soon enough! Only 32 days until the pike closes up there!
671036,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-29 00:25:00,65, Time's ticking!!  I haven't hit a pike yet this year.  I'm getting desperate LOL.
671094,tonka-toy,2012-02-29 02:55:00,139,I've had great luck at the park two streets north. If you cast from the most southernly section of the white rail you'll hit a deep edge . Hard spot to land them but can be worth it.
671145,EC1,2012-02-29 04:18:00,930,I'm hoping that ice will be off the bay sometime next week. Will want to go out on the weekdays!
671161,tonka-toy,2012-02-29 04:43:00,139,"Ice is gone,watched a guy wind-surfing across the bay yesterday at lunch"
671165,EC1,2012-02-29 04:54:00,930,Thanks for the quick update! We're really early this year! I don't think ice out is usually until early - mid march.
671167,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-29 04:58:00,65," At least for me, trying early paid off last Fall at Bronte.  What strange weather anything can happen hahaha"
