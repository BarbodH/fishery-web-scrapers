Just curious what the viewpoint of this is. And to others do you think such a thread should be deleted? I get that if it go heated it may be locked down as is the norm here."

671845,jedimaster,2012-03-01 17:33:00,3472,lol nice.
671847,NAW,2012-03-01 17:35:00,4022,Then why bring it up on OFC.  Debating this on one fishing board is enough..  IMO.
671849,jedimaster,2012-03-01 17:38:00,3472, It wasn't meant as a debate here about the actual event or non event but a question to what this boards moderators would do with such a thread. And the question was if it would be deleted. As I mentioned I would imagine it would be locked eventually.
671853,NAW,2012-03-01 17:45:00,4022,"Personally, I think if you have issues with the way someone is running their fishing board, you don't need to bring it up for discussion on another board.  If you have a question for the mods on how they would handle a certain situation, them PM them.?  No?  I might be totally out to lunch, but it seems to me that you're fishing for ammo to use against the person you're disagreeing with on another board."
