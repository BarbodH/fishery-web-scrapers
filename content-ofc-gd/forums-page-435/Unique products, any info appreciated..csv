672262,Nipfisher,2012-03-02 20:47:00,2449,The Emrod looks cool. It is modeled off of the Stub-Caster from the 60's -70's. The videos seem like it would work well off of shore. I have seen them advertised on kijiji.
672268,zamboniwaterboy,2012-03-02 21:21:00,126,"What is old is new again.  The owner makes it sound like he invented it, maybe refined should be the claim.  Just to clarify, I have the huge rooster tail, the loss of bottom echo at high speeds and have adjusted as much as I can within the parameters of the current transducer mount.  Anything over 15mph and the bottom is gone.   "

672271,mercman,2012-03-02 21:37:00,7054,Had the same problem with my transducer last season.Seems i had it tilted the wrong way.Make sure to tip the transducer so the trailing edge is lower than the leading edge.Worked for me.
