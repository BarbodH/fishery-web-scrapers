DO NOT make a post complaining about it. We have opened the forums to children so we expect you to show them how adults should behave.""  And:  ""We'll keep it simple. Be nice and be respectful. Like your Mom probably told you, if you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all.  Debate is encouraged, but please follow the basic guidelines of debate. No name calling. Back up your claims with proof. Don't get your knickers in a knot if someone disagrees. KEEP IT CIVIL!  Things that will not be tolerated. Flaming, baiting, name calling, prejudice, racism, sexism, sexual comments and inuendos, swearing, spam, and general boorishness.""    Op did not show a disagreement with a decision or complain about it. Someone may not have been happy about the post, and that must be part of the unwritten rules."
