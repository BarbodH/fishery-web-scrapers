672061,BillM,2012-03-02 03:12:00,17367,Would be nice if they were in HD!
672174,johnnyb,2012-03-02 14:29:00,3413,WFN is free this month...in HD...on Rogers!!	Just wish I had've checked for it before Dave's first show of the new season aired
672177,BillM,2012-03-02 14:39:00,17367,"I get WFN with my package, sucks Bell doesn't carry it in HD though."
672180,Mike Pike,2012-03-02 14:44:00,1332,"Ya, Cogeco in Hamilton doesn't offer WFN in HD either.  I've still ordered it, though, cuz nothing is better than having fishing shows available 24-7."
