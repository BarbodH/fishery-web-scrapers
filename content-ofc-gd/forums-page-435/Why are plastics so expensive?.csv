Tackle isn't cheap, especially for a shore guy like me who can snag lures.  Ebay and dollarama.... so far kinda relieve the issue lol."

671778,craigdritchie,2012-03-01 14:13:00,1586,"You want to know why plastics are so expensive? Because people want to pay that much, plain and simple.  If a tackle company puts out a bag of rubber worms for $2, the first thing that jumps into Joe Consumer's mind is ""Whoa, that's cheap. They must not be any good.""  Put the identical rubber worms into a different bag and price it at $12.99 and the same guy thinks ""Whoa, that's expensive! They must be awesome!""  It's Marketing 101 at is most basic.  Back in the 70's the Garcia company made several series of fishing rods, all differentiated by colour. There was the cheap Blue series, the more upscale Green series, the expensive Brown series, and the top-of-he-line Black series. No one bought the chap Blue rods ($12 - $15), and everyone coveted the high-end Brown rods ($50 - $75) and the uber-expensive Black ones ($75+). Guess what? The only thing different was the dye colour. Hardware, handles, blank, everything else was identical. I saw it myself when I toured the plant. They couldn't sell enough of the Brown rods and Black rods, because people assumed they just had to be better because they were way more expensive.  Bait companies have figured this out too, and that's why you pay $8 for a bag of plastic baits that are realistically worth 25 cents."
671779,Grimace,2012-03-01 14:21:00,2020,Same with the wine industry Craig.  It is sure death for a well respected winery to put out a bottle at 7 bucks because everyone will think they are making cheap wine.  Put it out for 30 bucks a bottle and you create your reputation.
671790,MichaelAngelo,2012-03-01 14:43:00,65,"An omnipresent marketing strategy, thanks for pointing it out Craig.  I used to do this when I sold my class notes in university.  BTW I like your blog, read the post about the vintage reels."
671792,Harrison,2012-03-01 14:46:00,2202," I saw this somewhere one time and really liked it.  Hopefully I remember it right.  ""Sometimes the excitement of a good deal is quickly lost to the disapointment of poor quality."""

671816,crappieperchhunter,2012-03-01 15:55:00,2582,  Being a wine drinker. I would 100% agree with you on this.  I have sampled...not bought...some god awful $30-$40 dollar a bottle wines.  I would put my home made wine up against some of them and it costs me less then $4 a bottle to make. But I will also freely admit that my homemade wine isn't really high end stuff...just comparable to some wines out there that people are really getting hosed on.
671923,craigdritchie,2012-03-01 21:09:00,1586,"   As a bit of a wino myself, I completely agree. I've had some really awful wine that was VERY expensive, and some really incredible wines that were quite cheap. One of the best was a home-made Port one of my wife's friends made.  With wine, part of the pricing is supply and demand. The quality of any wine is partly dependent on what the weather was like when the grapes were grown, which is why some vintages (years) are more valuable than others. 2010 was an amazing year for reds in Ontario, and especially in Niagara. If you want the steal of a lifetime, go to any LCBO right now and buy 2010 Niagara reds, and just hide them away in your basement for a couple of years. Right now they're $15 a bottle because there's all kinds of it around. Five years from now, you won't be able to buy it for 10 times that price (to be honest I wouldn't drink it today, as it's still too young and harsh. But lay it on its side for 5 to 10 years and it's going to be mind-blowing).  2007 was also a great year for Niagara reds. We bought up all we could find for about $12 - $15 a bottle when it came out. Now, it's $60 a bottle for the same stuff. There's just less of it around.    Thanks! No way would I pay that much for a Cardinal 3, but that's just me. I buy tackle to use, not to look at."

I can tell you that outside of the cost of the molds a senko costs me about 8 to 18 cents to make including the plastic (Plastisol), coloring and other additives.

Now I can buy a lot of lobster or steak for $72.00. I really don't mind paying a fair price for things but that is starting to sound a little high for me.  I was at CTC the other day and they had the Sufix Elite line (not on special). The 14 lb test was $4.96 for 330 yards the 6 lb test was $8.99 for 330 yards. Half the material, twice the price?

670350,Snidley,2012-02-27 16:49:00,620,"Personally I don't use soft plastics much but I agree if you shop at the retail outlets around the GTA you will be paying a lot for bags of brand name plastics. I am on the email lists of all the discount websites in the US and I find that brand name soft plastics are the most frequently discounted, often deep discounted, products offered. Websites like FFO-tackle.com, Overstock baitandtackle.com, fishandsave.com, as well as Basspro, Cabelas, tacklewarehouse's bargin bins often have plastics at $.75 to $2.00 a bag. The only thing is you need to carefully monitor the price of shipping because it can be very costly if you don't. Share the order with several buddies and this cost can be mitigated however. I believe there's a chap on this sites for sale section that regularly carries and extensive line of Yammamoto plastics for $5 a bag and you can pick them up from him ($5 is good but Overstockbait was selling that brand of plastics for $2 a bag just last week). Consumers really should learn to up their game if they are truly concerned about the price of any goods. If you roam around with your chin stuck out every retailer will take advantage since that would represent human nature."

It is whatever the consumer is willing to pay....or as they say ""whatever the market will bear"" and a combination of other things like brand name and marketing etc What do you think those $400+ plus rods and reels cost to make ?"
670134,Skipper D,2012-02-26 21:36:00,1970,"I like to think guys they are afordable from this perspective , i bought a bag of Berkley Gulp minnows last june , used them for the season over and over and still have most of them , they are still keeping good in the glass jar i put them in leaveing them available to use again this season . For the minnows atleast i find them afordable ."
670136,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-26 21:40:00,10439,Same reason gas is so expensive Cliff. They are both made of dinosaur juice!!!
670140,DaveMc,2012-02-26 21:47:00,89," No where near correct, i cant get into details but that isnt quite correct."
670144,captpierre,2012-02-26 22:00:00,2521,"That is where the free market should correct the problem...if there is one.  Unless there is extensive collusion.  If there is price gouging and lots of money to be made, somebody else comes in and competes with a similar product for less price, if there is no patent.  Cliff, I have thought the same.  Plastics seems expensive for what you get- especially since there are so many different brands out there. And hence competition."
670149,BillM,2012-02-26 22:42:00,17367," If you're going to correct someone, you should probably provide some proof  I don't think anyone is asking for hard numbers, but it would be interesting to see the point of view from the manufacturer in all of this."

670163,cram,2012-02-26 23:30:00,1733,Hopefully it becomes expensive enough to motivate people to move back to live bait.
670168,kickingfrog,2012-02-26 23:39:00,8333,Way cheaper then bait.
670170,Grimace,2012-02-26 23:47:00,2020,They have to pay the shills.
670177,SirCranksalot,2012-02-27 00:12:00,3291, Yup!!   
670178,Roger Gratton,2012-02-27 00:13:00,3,I work in the trucking industry and have the fortune of viewing the commercial documents that are presented to Canada Customs. These document indicate the cost of the goods being imported and you would be shocked at what most things cost versus what we pay.
670181,MCTFisher9120,2012-02-27 00:37:00,3761,"Your right Cliff, most of the prices you will see tho will come down in price this year. All of Berkley Powerbait went from 4.99 to 3.99 other stuff went from 5.99 to 4.99 the hollowbelly and fancy stuff went from 10.99 to 9.99 and the entire Gulp lineup has gone from 6.99 to 6.49  These are all minor bits of savings but it's about time. The guys at the store remember when a pack of worms were 7.99 plus tax. Times are changing. Let's see of other brands of plastics start to follow and fall back some."
670182,Tybo,2012-02-27 00:40:00,1373,The base products are ethylene and chlorine to make PVC.
670185,mercman,2012-02-27 00:49:00,7054,"Canada is the retail cash cow of the western world. Just look at the prices on Ebay, and compare that to what the stores are charging. Most Ebay prices are cheaper than what the stores are paying from the US manufacturers.When the orders come in from Canadian retailers, there is a whole different price list involved. I see it in my bussiness every day,and there is no way it can be justified."

By increasing the price, manufacturers are increasing the Mojo of your lure exponentially...5 out of 4 sponsored pro tournament bass fishermen agree"
670215,BillM,2012-02-27 01:52:00,17367, LOL!!!  And to think we catch steelhead on eggs and $0.05 in netting..  CRAZY!
