670968,Big Cliff,2012-02-28 22:12:00,6899,"Well, considering that we have less ice than usual here this year and the long range forecast is calling for well above normal temperatures here for at least the next two weeks with plenty of rain. I have a feeling this is going to be a very early spring. I'm guessing that the spawns will be a few weeks earlier than normal too so we are really going to have to adjust our fishing tactics to compensate. I'm betting ice out here and the boat in the water before April 1!"
670981,misfish,2012-02-28 22:30:00,29133,You just jinxed it Cliff.
670987,lew,2012-02-28 22:45:00,12766,"The weather doods are calling for 2-4"" of snow  up here tomorrow Cliff so spring may have to wait a few more days yet"
670989,Pikeslayer,2012-02-28 22:51:00,1443,Say when my friend. I'll be there.
670994,ketchenany,2012-02-28 23:01:00,3229,Big Cliff have you been looking at furry things and predicting the weather?
670995,mercman,2012-02-28 23:04:00,7054,Does that mean they will open the seasons earlier this year      I didnt think so......Oh well
671007,ecmilley,2012-02-28 23:21:00,2163,"got the batterys charging for the ranger right now cliff, i see any open water will down to pick you u up lol who knows crossed sturgeon lake in my pick up on sunday found 20 inches of ice off the golf course be around a couple weeks yet"
671014,mike rousseau,2012-02-28 23:29:00,4661,An early spring will make up for the late spring last year...  Last year I was getting walleye with eggs in em till June.... Never caught walleye with eggs in the spring before...  And maybe the weeds will get nice and thick again...
671017,camillj,2012-02-28 23:34:00,1988,Not so fast Cliff ... I have an Ice fishing trip planned for this weekend  But I suspect you are right ... I thought I got a whiff of 'Chrome' while walking by my backyard trib today
671087,Sinker,2012-02-29 02:44:00,8692,I had the boat out today. First time its ever seen water in Feb!!  S.
671187,Big Cliff,2012-02-29 11:15:00,6899,I don't think the Scugog river ever did freeze over this year. Most winters you could drive a sled right up the river into Lindsay at some point. Where did you have your boat in Sinker?
671235,whiskywizard,2012-02-29 13:52:00,305,"Normally I'd be happy waiting for Mother Nature to run her course, but this year I'm dying to get out on Sturgeon open water. Spring can come any time now!"
671247,grimsbylander,2012-02-29 14:14:00,3016,"I' glad I'm not the only one itching to get out. I pulled my boat out of the backyard last weekend and put it in the driveway. My plan was to do it early spring while the ground was still frozen but with the plus temps and rain coming, who knows? Anyway, redoing the livewell valves and plumbing and I'm going back in the water! Mid-March most likely. Muhahahaha"
671266,Peps,2012-02-29 14:42:00,191,"I agree with Cliff, this is the earliest I've seen geese paired up.  Saw my first pair almost 2 weeks ago.   Peps"
671273,Skipper D,2012-02-29 14:50:00,1970,"  Being a man of the land my hole life and watching the tell tail signs i'am with you on this Cliff , i know i better get the perch boat ready sooner then later . Mother nature will give another huff and puff a time or two then it will be here , her storms will be short lived from here on in , buds are all ready on some trees ."
671426,Sinker,2012-02-29 18:16:00,8692,"I was on quinte, Cliff. More open water than ice down that way, although we did fish close enough to ice to see some icefisherman.  Crazy winter for sure.  S."
