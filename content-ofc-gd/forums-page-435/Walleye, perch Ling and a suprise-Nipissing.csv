671157,Nipfisher,2012-02-29 04:36:00,2449,Pfffft....hammer handles. ya I'm jealous. Done driving at 1:30 tomorrow and will head to the hut in the storm.
671164,BassAsin,2012-02-29 04:51:00,806,Great report Chad.   One of the big ling I caught last week had a lamprey mark on it as well
671223,Rod Caster,2012-02-29 13:18:00,5784," Ya, its supposed to snow pretty heavy today! Good luck with the driving and fishing. I'm actually gonna take a fishing break today. I'll watch the storm from home/office  today"
671229,Nipfisher,2012-02-29 13:45:00,2449,  Storm cancelled.  I'm gonna fish from 2-4. Found a spot on my Navionics that looks like it drops from 16 - 36 fow in C. Bay. Gonna drive up and pop a few holes and check it out. maybe a good spoty for next year.
670547,Rod Caster,2012-02-28 01:00:00,5784,"Joey Tiger wanted to see some of the walleye I've been catching on Nipissing so I showed him.    We (I) caught 7 walleye and he missed a big girl, right at the hole. The perch were plenty.    It was very mild tonight, but the wind and snow were strong. The GPS guided us in and out.   Joey also caught a ling with an interesting parasite. This is the first time I see one of these on Nipissing. Has anybody else seen them here?      As it turns out, fishing ""blind"" isn't always a disadvantage.  Here's a bonus picture of Matt's (Bassassin) bad weather fishing system.  "
670555,corvette1,2012-02-28 01:12:00,1765,awesome trip congrats
670556,Leecher,2012-02-28 01:13:00,7832,Awesome Chad     You've been getting into some quality fish this season   Looks like the parasite is a leech of some sort
670560,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 01:22:00,8333,Many different types of native lamprey.
670561,mercman,2012-02-28 01:23:00,7054,Great outing Guys !!!! Isnt that a Lamprey?
670565,Leecher,2012-02-28 01:26:00,7832,   OK it's either a leechprey or lampleech    either way... it's a blood sucking parasite
670567,Rod Caster,2012-02-28 01:28:00,5784,"  Are any Nipising-native species of lamprey Parisitic? Joey was saying that the Northern Lamprey, a native species, isn't parasitic.  Until tonight, I've never even seen a lamprey mark on a Nipissing fish."
670570,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 01:31:00,8333,Some are parasitic but not all. The sea lamprey gets most of the attention because it is not native to the great lakes and hit the big game fish hard once it arrived.
670579,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 01:48:00,8333,"Had to dig up a text book.  Freshwater Fishes of Canada lists 9 species of lamprey in Canada, two types in Nipissing.  Northern Brook Lamprey: non-parasitic Silver Lamprey: parasitic  Dr. Salvelinus would be the best one on this board, that I am aware of, if you have more questions."
670580,irishfield,2012-02-28 01:49:00,26272,..and I'm pretty sure I read something very recently that they are trying to make the Silver a protected species!
670581,gino,2012-02-28 01:56:00,400,"Awesome!!! Not even the bad weather can keep u away from ice...great job, Chad!!!"
670584,Rod Caster,2012-02-28 01:58:00,5784," Thanks Rob, it would be hard to identify the lamprey from my photo. It would be a good sign for the lake if it's a Silver Lamprey.  I also wonder if maybe it's a Sea Lamprey; are there any other accounts of them in Nipissing?"
670585,Nipfisher,2012-02-28 01:59:00,2449,"R.C.,  Lots of the smaller pike we catch in the summer have lamprey marks on them. Seen a pictures of a few big pike and musky with them too.  Never heard / seen one on a ling. I don't think they kill the fish here. Just latch on and feed for a while. Still working that Wirek spoon? You better go buy a few more."
670588,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 02:03:00,8333,"Freshwater Fishes of Canada also mentions that the wound left by the Silver Lamprey is smaller, relative to the sea lamprey, and a single wound is not likely to cause ""death in any large heavily scaled fish that it might attack"" but on ""burbot and catfish they often penetrate the body wall and kill the individual""."
670590,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 02:05:00,8333, I don't believe the sea lamprey is in Nipissing.
670592,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-28 02:09:00,2690, Hopefully not!!  Great report Chad
670595,Rod Caster,2012-02-28 02:11:00,5784, what is this book you have and where can I get one?
670597,danc,2012-02-28 02:17:00,4677, Didn't someone catch a Chinook there a few years back? If a Chinny could find it's way in there...
670598,kickingfrog,2012-02-28 02:23:00,8333, Freshwater Fishes of Canada by W.B. Scott and E.J. Crossman  Amazon.ca has a used hardcover version listed for $1270.59.  You might be able to find a new soft cover for $100 or so. The other opton would be find a student who bought it and doesn't want/need it anymore. That's not me however.
670603,bigugli,2012-02-28 02:35:00,6138,Standard textbook can be ordered through any college book store.
670810,Joeytier,2012-02-28 16:41:00,3990,The French river is a very direct route from the Great Lakes....  The wound on the ling from yesterday was definitely smaller than what I've seen on chinook and steelhead in the great lakes.  However the eel was very large and definitely looked like the other sea lamprey i've seen.
670830,Nipfisher,2012-02-28 17:00:00,2449,Here is the wikipedia info.  Silver Lamprey
671043,Rod Caster,2012-02-29 00:47:00,5784,"We picked a spot on Callander Bay today and had a good mix of fish, but ""prime time"" was a bust! Joey was tuned right into the walleye and started catching them at 4pm. We also managed a few nice pike.          "
671048,Muskieman,2012-02-29 00:58:00,2472,"Salmon get caught in Nip regularly .. Lampleeches are common as well, never seen one on a Ling though ... Nice catches Chad & Joey !"
671152,EC1,2012-02-29 04:30:00,930, At least someone's having a great time on the ice lately! I've had 4 bad trips (3 skunks and 1 crappie) in the last week!
