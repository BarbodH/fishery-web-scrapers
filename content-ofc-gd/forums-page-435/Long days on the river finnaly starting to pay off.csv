670591,mikeseb,2012-02-28 02:08:00,201,"Was a beauty day today weather wise and the fishin was just as good!  I went 4 for 7, my best day yet steelheading so far.  Mostly smaller fish but I did manage to net a 26 inch buck.  http://s1063.photobu...justalilguy.jpg http://s1063.photobu...nt=26incher.jpg http://s1063.photobu...mallchromer.jpg http://s1063.photobu...nt=22incher.jpg"
670593,Leecher,2012-02-28 02:10:00,7832,Great job Oakvillebassguy    Nice chrome
670685,kingofthesteelhead,2012-02-28 12:27:00,140,somebody's hooked on steelheading! nice fish the bigger ones will come.
670696,limeyangler,2012-02-28 13:10:00,5204,Great stuff Oakvillebassguy. Like you said....payback for time well spent!
670963,davey buoy,2012-02-28 21:58:00,5505,"Great fish,nice way you hid your location:good:"
670972,mikeseb,2012-02-28 22:18:00,201, lol are you being sarcastic?  I think its pretty tough to tell where exactly that is
670992,misfish,2012-02-28 23:00:00,29133,"  I remember that bridge from 20 years ago.LOL  Nice fish.   Chill,Oakvillebassguy."
670997,davey buoy,2012-02-28 23:08:00,5505, No really I mean it lol.
671182,mikeseb,2012-02-29 08:09:00,201, lol ok sorry i just wasnt sure.  I know I have posted a pic or two on here with a little too much showing but thanks to the fabulous program paint that wont be happening again haha
671199,alexmedic,2012-02-29 12:35:00,186,Great catches!  Man those fish look naughty!
671248,Pondo,2012-02-29 14:15:00,36,Nice chrome?  Did you see any other fisherpeople there or were you alone?
671251,GbayGiant,2012-02-29 14:18:00,1780," Poacher or he can't read. He is fishing above HWY 2. I have friends who fish that river.  Bronte Creek - City of Burlington and Flamborough Twp., from the C.P.R. track in the Village of Progreston downstream to the south side of Hwy. 407, including part of Limestone Creek upstream to Steeles Avenue in the Town of Milton. Fish sanctuary - no fishing from Jan. 1 - Fri. before 4th Sat. in Apr. & Oct. 1 - Dec. 31."
671296,misfish,2012-02-29 15:40:00,29133, Your the second person to accuse him of that since he has joined.
671377,mikeseb,2012-02-29 17:31:00,201," Yes he is, and im not sure what is causing all this.  I would never do something so stupid!  All my fishing in 2012 has been done on a river that is open ALL YEAR so I dont know whats bringing these accusations on but its pretty ridiculous.  After all ive learned from this forum I figured Id return the favor and post reports of how Im progressing as a steelheader and show you guys some nice fish but theres always gonna be people trying to rain on your parade...."
671380,mikeseb,2012-02-29 17:34:00,201, Im sorry but why the heck are u accusing me of fishing bronte?
671392,craigdritchie,2012-02-29 17:41:00,1586,"Lots of places to fish around here with year-round seasons. I'm pretty sure I recognize the bridge and if I'm right, it's a far better spot than Bronte."
671409,solopaddler,2012-02-29 17:54:00,8605," I almost made a similar comment myself kid, then reconsidered. It looks an awful lot like Bronte. I can totally see how someone could make that assumption.  In any case nice job on the fish."
671412,12footspringbok,2012-02-29 18:00:00,459, We wonder why hardly any reports get posted anymore...  Keep up the good work.
671418,mikeseb,2012-02-29 18:06:00,201," Thanks.  I can assure everyone here I am NOT fishing bronte, I havent fished it since new years eve.  I would never do something as stupid as fishing closed water, especially when ive seen CO's parked at the qew on 2 separate occasions since the creek closed.  I would rather pay 10 bucks in gas to fish legally than walk to a closed river and risk loosing hundreds of dollars in gear and even more in fines."
