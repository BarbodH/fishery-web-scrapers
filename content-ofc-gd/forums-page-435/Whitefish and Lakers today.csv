672018,jat,2012-03-02 02:02:00,138,Simon how were you fishing the white tube jig? Thanks
672127,fishindevil,2012-03-02 12:39:00,6254,"awesome simon !!! very nice color on the fat tank lake trout !!! cool,what time is dinner ??? lol.."
672216,limeyangler,2012-03-02 17:40:00,5204," Thanks....it really is not much 'work' on this lake when the bite is on. In my experience this lake has 2 modes...FEAST....or...FAMINE...for us it was a feast day.    Thanks man...it sure was fun. The smelt in this lake keeps everything...BIG!     Hey JAT,  We were fishing 2 types of tubes, 2"" YUM Vibraking tubes in white silver flake with a Matzuo scicle jig heads in white and  Yum 4"" white silver flakeon  Matzuo Sickle Rattle Tube Jig  The whitefish would hit the 4"" tube but it was hard to hook them on that size but got the bigger trout....whereas the 2"" tube got all the whities and the smaller trout.  The whitefish would not take anything on the bottom today. They would only hit when having the bait(2"" tube) dead still at about 6' - 10' feet off bottom. Every now and then the bite would die down so i would send the big four inch tube down and pound the bottom. That would bring the fish back to the area and we would just hover our baits at 6' - 10 ' feet and the whities would attack hard and fast rising almost vertically at speed to suck in the bait.   Hope this makes sense and helps."

I think they are right next to the ladies swimsuits.    They are smelt....but its not a splake...there are no splake in there.    Thanks Frankie...its about time!    Thanks Gino...it was a blast, nice to have my buddy there too...good fun.   Your in Sudbury and fish Nippissing...ask Blair ......he'll sort you out!   Thanks man!    You would be shunned and banished by all the other steelheaders Mike!    Thanks RC. I used to go all the way to the Manitoba border for whities...like you say...i'm glad this is close by!"

670755,mr blizzard,2012-02-28 15:31:00,1589," Amazing day of fishing Simon, good for you, your back on track.  Going to have to come back south to fish with you for a day. No whities caught here yet.  My son and I enjoyed the video, thanks again,  Strangely no one really fishes for whities up here in the winter,   hard to find where they are.  Alot of whities are caught casting in late summer into fall, alot different from back east.  Thanks again for posting the video, we will look for a seat sale.  Cheers and the next time u go out catch one for us."
670759,Slayingm,2012-02-28 15:42:00,204,You are in God's country for sure and those are awesome fish... WTG!!... question is?... so you have a matching pair of fuzzy pink slippers for the gloves?

671892,limeyangler,2012-03-01 19:47:00,5204, Funny old lake that one eh?...seems to be feast or famine. I'll be there for another kick of the can next week sometime.    The second one was probably the most aggressive strike i have ever seen....raced 20' off the bottom almost vertically in like 2 seconds....BLAM! really freekin anihilated the bait.... cool
