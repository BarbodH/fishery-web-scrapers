671024,Joey,2012-02-28 23:57:00,9122,Excellent post Simon  Roloff is sure getting big
671042,Ralph Field,2012-02-29 00:43:00,1018,Looks to me like everyone had fun.
671056,bigugli,2012-02-29 01:10:00,6138,"Isn't it great spending time watching the boy grow. Especially with the beautiful surroundings of nature's playground. As for the dog, he's not halfway to full grown. There are a couple of chocolates in the neighbourhood that weigh in over 120lbs. The one at the farm, Remington, is so happy to see me he has bowled me over a few times."
671058,brkygetr,2012-02-29 01:14:00,425,Dude...Jack eats better at lunch than I do! Do you deliver?
671090,Leecher,2012-02-29 02:46:00,7832,I'm glad to see you boys spend some quality   time together at the shack    It put a smile on my face

671214,corvette1,2012-02-29 13:02:00,1765,awesome day for a lunch
671230,johnnyb,2012-02-29 13:47:00,3413,That is absolutely awesome.  What a great way for that boy to grow up
671281,Machine57,2012-02-29 15:13:00,22,Glad to see Roloff pull up a chair beside Jack at lunch..That's one smart pooch!!
671507,Rattletrap2,2012-02-29 20:45:00,1652,"What a lucky little dude! A great Dad, a beautiful pup for a friend, fishing mid week, and yes, Jack does get nicer lunches than most of us!!! Way to go!"
671511,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-29 20:51:00,2690,"Great stuff, Simon.  Awesome shots of Jack and ""the gremlin""!"
671517,Old Man,2012-02-29 21:04:00,822,I've heard rumors that Jack regularly out fishes dad. Is this true Simon?  Those photos show the best type of fishing.
671530,mr blizzard,2012-02-29 21:30:00,1589,"Hey Simon once again great pics;   to catch fish is a bonus    to spend time together outdoors is priceless. After reading your post Ben my son, and I took out some albums with pics of fishing over the past few years.  Best times ever. Check your email if u get a chance. Cheers"
671657,limeyangler,2012-03-01 02:09:00,5204, He sure is...he sits stretched out just like Ralphie in your signature pic!    Yup...not much complaining from any of us....lol    Thanks Bruce...lol...OMG...120lbs   I doubt it Dale....lol...i seem to remember a pretty awesome moose smokie shore lunch you served me once!    Thanks Jacques.....yup...same happens when you post with your daughter....fun times.
671658,limeyangler,2012-03-01 02:10:00,5204," LOL...crazy winter eh? I hear that there is green grass just south of International Falls....CRAZY!    Thanks Corvy...it sure was a nice day...sun, blue skies and only -1!    It certainly feels like we made the right decision to move here when you see Jack out there doing his stuff!    He's incredibly dumb and incredibly smart at the same time.    Thanks Rattletrap...i definitely am blessed to have such an awesome kid....i'm growing fonder of the dog everyday...its been a slow prcess as i have always been a cat person and its taken a while to get to adjust to a pup.    LOL...the gremlin ears...you were so spot on with that!    You know what Gord...Jack has yet to witness a fish come through the ice! But if he is anything like his mum he will outfish me for sure!    Ahhhhh...awesome. I'll check my mail now."
671675,Old Man,2012-03-01 02:28:00,822," Yeah, I hear you. I've got the same problem. The wife out fishes me quite often.  I just chalk it up to my excellent guiding ability"
