How does one go about adding a ""Digital Signature"" (not to be confused with an auto-signature one adds to their emails)to a document etc.  Is the process different for each type of document IE :Word, Excel, PDF?  Lastly, can it be added to any document one is sending?  Thanking all in advance.  A Confused  Meely"
