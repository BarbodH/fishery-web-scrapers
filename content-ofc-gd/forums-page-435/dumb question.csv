672036,Curtisss,2012-03-02 02:34:00,25,How do you pronounce Daiwa?  Day-wa? Or Die-wa?
672039,uglyfish,2012-03-02 02:39:00,981,ur second  choice up there lol.
672041,ccmtcanada,2012-03-02 02:39:00,7971,I pronounce it die-wa.
672044,MJL,2012-03-02 02:41:00,2427,It's neither...The D is silent
672045,kickingfrog,2012-03-02 02:45:00,8333,"I rarely say it, but I guess I pronounce it die-a-wa. Never gave it a second thought, until now... I'll have to change. I changed how I pronounce Rapala."
672051,Curtisss,2012-03-02 02:48:00,25,"I know what you mean with Rapala. You used to put the emphasis on the first syllable? If so, me too."
672056,John Bacon,2012-03-02 02:58:00,3277,I pronounce it Die-a-wa too... it doesn't make any less sense then how Bret Favre pronounces his name.
672058,NAW,2012-03-02 03:06:00,4022,X3 for Die-A-Wa
672284,express168,2012-03-02 21:56:00,327,""" Die-Wa you no catching no fish!"" Use Abu Garcia is what a friend once told me."
672287,misfish,2012-03-02 22:03:00,29133,Die-wa and rap-la
672294,bigugli,2012-03-02 22:19:00,6138,Rapala should be pronounced  rrrrapala. In Finnish the R's are rolled and the vowels are not silent.
672307,bushart,2012-03-02 22:50:00,2628,Bought a new Daiwa spinning reel this winter---better say it right
672339,limeyangler,2012-03-03 00:15:00,5204,With an English accent?
672348,misfish,2012-03-03 00:29:00,29133, 
672418,bigugli,2012-03-03 02:07:00,6138,"There is no such thing as an English accent.  There are cockers, scousers, taffs, micks, geordies, etc....."
672426,limeyangler,2012-03-03 02:19:00,5204,I have to concede you are right....in a way...but Micks and Taffs would shoot you for suggesting they are English and i have no idea what 'cockers' are...not sure i want to....lol.
672439,bigugli,2012-03-03 02:35:00,6138,"A Taff I knew who absolutly loathed cockneys, called them cockers.  Us colonials also didn't like being called ""wogs"""
672469,Tootsie II,2012-03-03 03:04:00,162,"LMAO! Boy, some of us are bored tonite."
