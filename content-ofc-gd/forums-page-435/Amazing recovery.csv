671864,mike rousseau,2012-03-01 18:10:00,4661, Lol  Last year I had a carp on that I thought was a money winner in a bet ( first to catch a 30lb carp that year gets $20) I had with a buddy...Fish got snagged up... So I waded out in the water (in may!!!)up to my neck in my regular cloths and shoes to free up my catch... Got it free and headed back to shore to net the fish...  Boy was I upset when it was only 24lbs...  : (
