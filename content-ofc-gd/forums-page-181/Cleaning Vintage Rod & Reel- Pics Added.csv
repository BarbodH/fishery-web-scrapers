909918,Pikeslayer,2015-04-13 22:06:00,1443,"Hey All, I'm looking for advice on cleaning & restoring a garage sale find. Here's the picks:         Advice appreciated, Slayer"
909944,Mister G,2015-04-13 23:57:00,1429,"Nice looking combo, do you have any info on it ?  Not sure about vintage rod/reel combos but with firearms it's a NO NO to clean them up. If you do, you lose a LOT of the value if you sell it. You might want to check on that before doing anything to that combo."
909945,ecmilley,2015-04-14 00:03:00,2163,"a mr.clean magic eraser will do wonders on the cork, as for the shiny parts i would try a mothers power ball does wonders on a snowmobile tunnel then polish with microfibre cloth."
909988,Pikeslayer,2015-04-14 02:44:00,1443," It has late 19th & early 20th patent pending dates. I'll post some detail pics later. I was wanting to basically clean the dust & grime without compromising the finish?  Actually it is not cork, rather a very dense, deep colour hard wood. I don't think chemical based cleaners are part of the equation here?"
910002,Mister G,2015-04-14 08:51:00,1429,"If you have no intentions of selling it then clean them up and it will display very nicely. If you do want to flip it for a profit don't even take the dust and grime off of it until you talk to a collector.  Like I said if they are judged like firearms the collectors want all the patina (rust), dust and grime that comes with aging of the item. I know, sounds weird but I'm not a vintage collector so maybe someone else can chime in and explain that."
910038,cuzza,2015-04-14 13:18:00,467,Looks like a great find!  I've had good results with 00000 grade wire wool (or whatever the finest is) used gently and a Dremel with a felt pad and polishing compound - that was on a cane rod with a similar steel reel seat.  The handle itself looks fine and I think you'd struggle to improve the blank much without completely refinishing it - looks like glass fibre and they're not meant to be perfectly smooth anyway
910039,Sinker,2015-04-14 13:35:00,8692,I wouldn't touch it myself. You'd just be removing all the character.  S.
910083,bare foot wader,2015-04-14 16:13:00,1354,"cleaning is one thing, but restoring is another thing....you want to keep the patina  looking at those pics, I'd give it a light wipe down with a cloth to clean off the dust, but wouldn't do anything aggressive"
910118,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-14 18:01:00,937,Sweet find!
910188,Pikeslayer,2015-04-14 22:06:00,1443,"Based on advice here & some internet research, I'm going to clean with Murphy's Oil diluted with water & a non abrasive cloth to remove dirt & grime and not compromise the patina  here's some more pix;  Reel has what appears to be some kind of braided line...

910235,Nipfisher,2015-04-15 01:30:00,2449,Very nice. Have you Googled the reel name and manufacturer? Reel is listed on eBay for $23 US. Couldn't find much on the rod.

Did a little bit of research but not overly concerned with value as the story behind the combo is 'priceless'.  Our son Sean bought the combo from a neighbours garage sale just about 20 years ago. He was 5 or 6 at the time and paid a whopping $4.00 for it
