911128,Stern Rules,2015-04-20 03:50:00,342,Someone told me today at the ponds that you can't fish there until next weekend. He said it's part of a conservation area and you can't fish there yet and it's been like that for awhile. This is the first I've heard of it. Is this true?

I know they used to stock the ponds with trout, but I'm not sure if thats still ongoing.  All other zone 16 regs would apply I assume.  I didn't see anything about a sanctuary, but its been a long time since I've been there!"
911262,G.mech,2015-04-20 19:56:00,830,I live just down the road and I know people fish there all year around (that doesn't necessarily mean it's legal but it's a fact).  It is part of the Long Point Region Conservation Authority and nowhere in their info does it list any restrictions on fishing so I would assume that the Zone 16 regs are the only rules.   They do have a maximum motor size of 9.9HP on the ponds however but that shouldn't be a big deal given the size of them.
