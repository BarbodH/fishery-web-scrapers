911193,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-20 15:06:00,2582,Aunt Tress's gift is your biggest concern if you ask me. Those OLD lights could be your answer if your house burns down. I look after them and they are only out for 3 weeks tops every year. I plug them into a timer and they are only on for 4 hours a night. Never really gave it any thought that they might be a problem.  Thx for bringing it up though because it is something to think about. Perhaps it is time to retire them.  Thx to everyone for the help. It is appreciated.
911023,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-19 20:11:00,2582,Need to get a 50ft electrical cord to plug in my 30ft string of christmas lights I hang on the front of the house. This is the only purpose for this cord. I have heavy duty 12 gauge ones for other purposes.  My question is.... will a 16 gauge cord be good enough for this purpose? Checked them out today and the 16 gauge ones are on sale at Crappy Tire for 1/4 the price of 12 gauge. Just trying to save a few bucks....but I don't wanna be cheap if it is going to be any kind of a problem.  Thank you to anyone who can help me with this.   Thx Burtess just edited my post. I had my numbers mixed up. Basically I need to know if the light duty cords will handle the job of supplying power for my Christmas lights or should I go to a medium or heavy duty cord?
911025,Burtess,2015-04-19 20:14:00,901,Wire gets thicker as the gauge goes down.... so 12 gauge is heavier than 16.  If the 12 is cheaper than the 16 then get it!!  Burt

911029,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-19 20:25:00,2582,Why not buy a bulk of cabtire and add your own sealed male/female connectors Steve? Strictly cost Brian. 50ft light duty extension cord  $14.99.  I'll save a few bucks if I can but not at the risk of doing something foolish.

911034,misfish,2015-04-19 20:38:00,29133,"My thinking was, he can make his own and have a quality cord. Thats all I was thinking here. These pre made  things. just tick me thats all,"
911035,misfish,2015-04-19 20:39:00,29133,"B, he'll buy enough wire to make a electric smitty.  Now thats just silly talk.LOL"
911036,sofabed,2015-04-19 20:47:00,119,For the amount of current draw from the xmas lights you will have no issues with the 16 awg cord.
911037,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-19 20:48:00,2582,"To answer your question, the 16 gauge cord will push 30ft string of lights That's all I wanted to know. Called light duty and it said 50ft could handle 10 AMPS. Not being an electrician don't have a clue what that means."
911038,davey buoy,2015-04-19 20:50:00,5505,"Cabtire is nice,but after sitting outside a couple seasons cracks like heck.I just use the outside cords, outside.Have a couple hundred feet of cabtire cords I use inside on certain jobs."

These pre made  things. just tick me thats all, I priced a male and female end first Brian. 11.99 and 4.99 ...and then I have to buy the cord. $14.99 for 50 ft NOMA cord just seemed like a better deal."
911041,misfish,2015-04-19 20:54:00,29133,I hear ya Steve.
911042,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-19 20:58:00,2582,  You got my interest here? What foolish? The cost or the making your own sealed extension? All I meant by foolish Brian is I didn't want to buy the light duty if it wasn't up to the job. I'll do what I can to save a buck....but not if it's gonna burn my house down
911065,Fisherman,2015-04-19 23:15:00,7201,"That's all I wanted to know. Called light duty and it said 50ft could handle 10 AMPS. Not being an electrician don't have a clue what that means. 10 Amps is roughly 1000 watt, that 16 awg can handle that no problem at all even at 50' long."
911076,Big Cliff,2015-04-20 00:30:00,6899,LED or regular lights Steve?
911081,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-20 00:45:00,2582,LED or regular lights Steve?  LOL. The strings of lights I have Cliff where given to us by my Great Aunt when we bought our first house. They are older then me....hell they might be older then you   I have a big shopping bag of old bulbs and I usually have to replace 3 or 4 every year when I hang them up.  Funny I really love a lot of the new LED light options now and every Christmas  I think about getting something new and different but I just can't part with Aunt Tress's gift.  But to your question...is there a difference?
911087,John Bacon,2015-04-20 01:11:00,3277, But to your question...is there a difference?  LEDs will draw less current and could in theory be safely run on a lighter or longer cord.
911135,Big Cliff,2015-04-20 08:55:00,6899, LEDs will draw less current and could in theory be safely run on a lighter or longer cord. Yup!

911138,Sinker,2015-04-20 11:09:00,8692,"Yes, id say the old lights should be the bigger concern over the extension cord.  S."
911143,aplumma,2015-04-20 11:55:00,6896,Here is some help for you  amps X volts = watts  watts divided by volts = amps   start up load on a motor is usually 1.5 times the total amp reading. This is handy when figuring fuse size and generator load calculations.   Art
911170,gaspumper,2015-04-20 13:26:00,393,"Another thing to look at is how much hydro do the old lights draw,the led would use very little."
911183,lazybum,2015-04-20 14:17:00,142,"That's all I wanted to know. Called light duty and it said 50ft could handle 10 AMPS. Not being an electrician don't have a clue what that means. After figuring out that the 16awg cord can handle up to 1,200 watts (120v x 10 amps) your next step is to figure out how many watts the old string of lights will use.  For example, assuming each bulb uses 5 watts then you should be able to power up 240 bulbs (1200 watts divided by 5 watts each)."
