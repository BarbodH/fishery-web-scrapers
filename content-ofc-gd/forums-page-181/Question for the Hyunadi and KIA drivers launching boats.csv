I have a BMW X5 and have had it since new.  My X5 handels nicely if you run it like a its a sports car.  But in nornal driving,  that Sorento drives every bit as nicely and has just as much power as the X5, and their repair experience has ben WAY better than mine.  A brake light switch and the one other minor thing I can't recall.  I am spending about $4K per year on repairs on my X5 every year since the warrranty expired.  On the Sorento I do find the throtttle a bit touchy.  There was a TSB that the dealer did to lessen the throttle response a bit, but its still a bit quick.  You get used to it, but its still a bit quick for my liking."

I've had a couple jeeps that had chrysler reject warranty claims on, something about submerging and hydrolocking engines, if your gonna sink your rubicon i suggest a snorkel not a cold air intake. as for most warranty claims its up to the car company not the dealer, a decent dealer will go to bat for a customer and try to get warranty claims approved but in the end its to the manufacter who approves it."
905176,Rizzo,2015-03-21 19:27:00,4754,"For everyday use, you will save money. For towing I don't think it will make much of a difference. I used to have a  Chevy Avalanche....bigtime gas guzzler. To tow the boat to St Clair and back would cost me $120. If I just drove the truck to St Clair and back without towing it would cost me basically the same. The truck did not know the boat was even there. When I got rid of the Avalanche we got a Caravan. Awesome I thought! And it is WAAAAYYY better fuel economy if I am just driving and not towing anything. I could drive to St. Clair and back and it might go through $50 in fuel. Less than half the price of the Avalanche...BUT...put the boat behind there and just watch that Caravan suck up the gas....I swear I can see the needle literally moving. Cost to tow with the Caravan to St. Clair and back? Basically the same as towing with the truck...over $100 for sure. Long story short, towing with the truck had minimal impact on fuel economy, towing with the van cut the fuel economy in half. Sorry to burst your bubble. You will see improved day to day costs, but put the boat back there and you will still be opening your wallet big time."

I paid for the timing chain change at 90,000 per the maintenance manual. at 124,000 - 24000 after the end of warranty- the timing chain let loose and the 0 interference engine did a self destruct.  The dealership that did the timing chain was no longer a Hyundai dealer, and basically told me to pound salt. I took the receipts to our local dealer in Brantford (where I had originally bought it) , who went to bat for me.  Hyundai paid for all but 120.00 of the repairs on what was an almost 3k bill.  Sinker - your experience was bad - but really, without proof of that oil change, and being done at the dealership I am not sure any dealer of any vehicle would have accepted that cost?  And to the OP - I pulled my dual console 16 footer for a year (after the events above - before that I used them Sierra) with  the the Sante Fe for a year. It could do it, and managed all the ramps fine (including Fishmasters and Port Burwell if you are familiar with those), but it worked, really hard, and I didn't feel that long term it would have been able to handle it. Fuel use went through the roof when it was on too.  I use the same fuel with the Ridgeline as I did with the SF"

Used to feel that way Raf. That's why we leased an Accent a few years back. 3 close friends had them and loved them but I was still unsure. The lease was bullet proof. In Nov 2005 we bought a brand new Accent. It still is my wifes daily driver. No issues whatsoever just regular maintenance.  And so far I am loving the Santa Fe. A co worker has a 2009 Tuscan that has over 400KM on it without any problems. If you look after them they seem to have became a pretty dependable drive.

904495,tb4me,2015-03-18 20:20:00,3295,Heres the deal.. Im looking at buying the wife the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport or the KIA Sorento.. Both are all wheel drive and have smaller motors.2l and 2.4l I think.. Anyway I have my boat parked up on the Trent river where I do 90% of my fishing. The launch up there is steep and concrete. The boat is a 17.5 foot with a 90 Johnson with all the bells and whistles. Does anyone think it will have issues launching and retrevinng my boat from the launch? I have an 08 Ram 4x4 thats not fun to drive anymore with the price of gas. It costs me aprox 140 bucks to drive 600km just so i can launch a boat.. With the new Korean rides they seem well built and reasonably priced..Using the fuel mileage #s they post it will only cost me 50 to 60  bucks there and back in gas.. That equates to me doing a TON more fishing then normal..

Compared to what your used too...going to your trailer without towing will practically be free
904526,Beavertail,2015-03-18 22:08:00,331,"I've been using a Honda CRV(2.5L AWD) to tow my rig for the past season. Smaller boat than yours but I'm guessing around the 1300lb range. Never had a problem on any ramps, some quite steep. That being said I just upgraded to a Hyundai Sante Fe with the V6, no experience with towing yet though. AWD makes all the difference."
904528,wallyboss,2015-03-18 22:28:00,1095,Verify the towing capacity of the Santa Fe?  That stopped me from replacing my Ford Escape with one!!
904535,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-18 22:46:00,10439,Verify the towing capacity of the Santa Fe?  That stopped me from replacing my Ford Escape with one!!  Both of the vehicles he is looking at have 2000# towing capacities. But I don't think that will be an issue as he is only using it for launching and retrieving. I would guess if the OP had to trailer a long distance he would use the real truck.

I bought from rexdale Hyundai my 2011 Tucson (used) and brought it in for a noise in the front, ended up being a tie rod (less than a month into owning it) and the parts and labour were covered, but the alignment of $80 was not. Also the passenger heated seat level high light was out, ok great labour is covered parts aren't"
904554,Fishwilly,2015-03-19 00:12:00,206,We just picked up a 2014 Ford Escape with 2.0l Eco boost turbo. Rated for towing 3500 lbs

Rated for towing 3500 lbs I just priced one of those..Nice cars however they are much more money then the Korean vehicles..Its a shame cause I liked them. that ford lease was almost 500 a month tax in for 48 month lease.The same lease for the kia with more options was 100 less then the ford a month...Its a shame north American makers cant keep competitive.. Id hate to see what our auto industry looks like in 10 years at this rate..I save $4800 dollars over 4 years just by buying Korean, then so be it..."

The boat always stays up on the Trent. even in the winter it goes into a community rec hall..If I ever wanted to tow it back to Brantford here id drive the big red Ram
904597,Paudash,2015-03-19 02:24:00,273,I had a 2009 Santa Fe but it was only a 2wdr   Towed my 17ft crestliner with a 40hp with no issues at all.
904612,Kerry,2015-03-19 03:59:00,383,"My wife had the 2012 Sorrento.Great vehicle AWD very comfortable for an import.Very good power for a 2.4.Only problem was in town mileage sucked period.She does a lot of that.Now she has a Forte, not AWD   but ok for her stuff I guess.I would think the Sorrento would meet your needs well.

904641,glenner,2015-03-19 13:14:00,56,"For what it's worth, I've owned several Hyundai cars and one Kia van over the years. I had a lot fewer problems with the Hyundais. The Kia kept going through cat converters and leaving me stranded. When it was running properly (which honestly was most of the time) it was a good vehicle to drive, but I found my Hyundais to be pretty bullet proof."
904657,James77,2015-03-19 14:43:00,175,"Just throwing this out there, have you looked at Subaru? I got the 2014 XV Crosstrek, It's a crossover and gets unbelievable mileage. The AWD system is unbelievable. It's only rated for 1500 pounds towing in Canada, the same car in the UK is rated for 3500 pounds. For just launching I'm sure it would be excellent. The mileage numbers for me. All highway/country roads: 5.8 L/100KM City /Highway combo 6.2 L/100 KM City 7.2 L/100 KM The tank is 59 L, if you drive efficiently you can get 1000 kms on a tank for a long haul.  I love it. I definitely go on a lot more trips because of it."
