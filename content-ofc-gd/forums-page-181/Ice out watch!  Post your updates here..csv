There is a lot of ice on the West shore and if the wind does decide to push it this way before it really softens up, it could make a mess. I'm not even going to TRY to do anything with my docks until for another two weeks yet. I have never seen it break up like this in 14 years!"

I was out on the ice though this weekend doing some work and it was solid. I have a feeling I will be dodging bergs on opener.  The small channels with current are open, but anywhere in the main area is very very solid still."

Scugog and Rice look clear.  Kawarthas are well on their way too.  Now...what's scaring me are the threads about water levels!!!
