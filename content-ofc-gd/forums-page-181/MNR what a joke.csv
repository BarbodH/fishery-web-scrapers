I play it safe and only keep walleye between 14-19 inches but if I catch one in the slot, I keep it. That being said walleye is open in my zone till November 15 and I will keep 4 of them if I can get them. But anything outside of the slot goes back.  I wasnt clear, in district 14 the slot is what you are not allowed to keep. Its the opposite of many other places where slot fish are the ones you are supposed to keep i.e. in the kawarthas you can keep walleye between 15-22 or somehwere in that range, meanwhile in 14 you are not allowed to keep anything between 16 and 22.   Seconded to the idea that CO's pay for themselves, there is more than the hourly wage to account for, boats, gas, benefits etc all cost money, although personally I am not against the idea. its the old point that I have fished my entire life and purchased my sport license and followed the rules to a T (with the very rare honest mistake) meanwhile guys are sitting on peirs fishing out of season fish and gutting them on the spot."

One year on Rice I was stopped four times in five days, twice in the same day Been checked on Lake St. Clair, West Arm and also been stopped on the highway not once but twice. On year on a flyin they flew into the lake I was on and check the cabin and one of the boats in our group, don't know how but they missed me on that one. Never had a problem with them except for a ticket on Nipissing that was non fishing related I was kind of ticked off at them one year on Lake St Clair, our boats were side by side at the launch, we shared small talk, I motor out of the channel and set my trolling lines, wasn't out 5 minutes and here they came for the shake down, we were good, they could have asked at the ramp"

These G2Gs usually happens frequently during the summer months possibly monthly  As for the MNR saying their probably Natives, that is an insult to every aboriginal, and government stereo typing at its finest, that's just an excuse for them not to not investigate, BTW  Native Treaty rights are a Federal issue, and will trump the Provincial fishing regulations every time in court, and if the government hasn't the time, the care or the balls to investigate the disappearance of over 1400 indigenous women, the last thing they want to do is ruffle the feathers of signed Treaty rights."

The goods news is that spawn is going full tilt with lost of walleye and the largest being around 10 lbs.  Now the bad news is the their were people fishing for them and the cut up walleye on shore.  When he called the MNR to report it he was told they were most likely native and not to worry about it.  When he then told them they definitely were not native they still said not to worry about it.  He then drove up the road to the police station up the road to report it.  At the station the office said he was just down their writing tickets and he will head back again shortly.  Should the MNR not be at every dam for the next 2 weeks protecting the fish?  I remember calling a few years back about a similar issue in Omemee with the same response from the MNR
