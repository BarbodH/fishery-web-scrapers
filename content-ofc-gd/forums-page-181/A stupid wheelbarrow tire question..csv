910101,captpierre,2015-04-14 17:19:00,2521,Brought out the wheelbarrow. No air in tire.  I doubt there is a hole. Says tubeless on the side. Hooked up a DC pump Sides are too loose on the rim and air escaping. How can I inflate this thing? No gas station around here at the cottage.
910106,Terry,2015-04-14 17:22:00,14456,wet a towel and lay it at the and rim and you may need to hold it down  and crank the air pressure up till it  starts to inflate
910107,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-14 17:23:00,10439,A bit of hair spray and a match!!  You can also try a ratchet strap around the circumference of the tire as this pushes in on the middle while forcing the beads outwards. I like the explosive approach myself!!!!
910108,fishnsled,2015-04-14 17:23:00,3520,"Put a ratchet strap on the tire to hold the edges tight to the rim, fill with air.  It's worked for me."

910121,Beans,2015-04-14 18:35:00,3339,"Hey Captain...Welcome to my club  Yesterday, using a foot pump I inflated all three tires on my push type wheelbarrow to 30 psi only to find two of them have gone soft...looks like a job for Patrick's Tire at county roads 36 & 24 just below Bobcaygeon...not sure if they can fit them with inner tubes...maybe I might buy a couple of solid rubber tires at Crappy Tire for the smaller tires...    I also did the tires on my steel garden wagon and they stayed inflated..."
910136,captpierre,2015-04-14 19:10:00,2521,I tied to snug the tire down with a rope. Still too much leakage at rim. I think I'll try at a gas station with more pressure Why don't they have a tube?  Money saver?
910137,Terry,2015-04-14 19:13:00,14456,yup saves money  you can put one in if you want
910146,ketchenany,2015-04-14 19:45:00,3229,"Put tubes in my snowblower so many years ago I don't remember, never had a problem since."
910182,Dave Bailey,2015-04-14 21:27:00,1641,Have you tried cleaning the rim first with some steel wool? If the rubber has been out of contact with the metal for a while there may be some corrosion that's preventing a good seal.
910185,Fisherman,2015-04-14 21:45:00,7201,P/A has small tire tubes for wheelbarrows.  $3.99  item #8244618
910217,captpierre,2015-04-15 00:01:00,2521,"Plastic rims If you put a tube in, what happens with the tire valve ?"
910228,Fisherman,2015-04-15 00:41:00,7201,You take it out and the valve from the tube goes there.
910766,Beans,2015-04-18 05:26:00,3339,Ordered three inner tubes ($4.99 ea.) for my wheelbarrow today from Princess Auto as the tires went soft again even after pumping up to 40 psi...when they arrive I will take the wheels off and run them over to Patrick's Tires for installation...  Princess Auto had the best prices hands down...saw some at $6.99 for the small tires and $9.99 for the front tire and I think Wally-Mart wanted $11.99...
910776,lew,2015-04-18 09:26:00,12766,My wheel barrow tire was only 5 years old but completely weather checked and wouldn't hold air this year either. I took the wheel down to a local tire dealer on Thursday and he replaced the tire.  Total cost out the door was $33

910788,woodenboater,2015-04-18 12:50:00,2277,tempted to replace my tires with the non inflatable/puncture proof ones but they seem pretty solid. anyone have any experience with these ?
910887,Entropy,2015-04-18 23:28:00,747,"Princess auto has a $3.99 cent tube for this problem, if you have put a tube on one before it takes 10 min tops.  OR. if you are like me the first time I did it, I did way more work than needed, and had to 'learn' how to do it by trial-and-error, that time took me almost 1.5 hrs."

911152,Mister G,2015-04-20 12:25:00,1429,About 10-15 years ago I put Fix-A-Flat (spray in) in my wheelbarrow tire and it holds up great. I do need to put a little air in once a year though but it's never too low that the bead broke.
