910834,fisherman7,2015-04-18 18:47:00,325,Stopped in on the way home. Mostly full of suckers with the odd walleye here and there and what looked like one sturgeon swimming around. I think the run is mostly done.
910836,Terry,2015-04-18 18:51:00,14456,did you get a photo of the sturgeon  most likely the mnr would like to see simcoe sturgeon
910947,fisherman7,2015-04-19 11:40:00,325,Unfortunately no and it was too far down to really make it out with a camera.

910954,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-19 12:41:00,2582,Talked to a CO there a few years back. He said the numbers had really fallen. I used to look forward to a drive over there to check out the eyes under the dam. I have stopped going because they just aren't there anymore like they used to be and I can see all the suckers I want down here in the Lake O tribs.
