Plan was to see if the smelt were running up the creek yet and to send minnows and imitation spawn drifting under a slip bobber in the current to get whitefish pike, and hopefully a laker or two. Plans came to an abrupt end when I got to the mouth of the creek to find hardly any open water and the water that was there was unfishable due to depth and/or access.  Was a nice walk for an hour with the dog, and Roloff got to go swimming….you know that aint gonna warm your gonads! We saw a rabbit and a pike swimming up the creek, Roloff went in after it…..he skunked too!   "
