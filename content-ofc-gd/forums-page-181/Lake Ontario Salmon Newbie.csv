909567,Billjones,2015-04-12 12:41:00,1,"Hi there,  I will be keeping my boat on lake Ontario this season (at outer harbour in Toronto). We plan to troll for salmon. I would appreciate some tips on fishy spring spots and any info on depth/temp where the salmon can be found early season.Thanks!Bill"
909691,Freshtrax,2015-04-12 21:45:00,2215,Your on the wrong side of the lake for most of the spring fishing.  I'm sure early in the year you could fish the mudlines and pickup rainbows.
909693,BillM,2015-04-12 21:53:00,17367,"Spring spots, you'll wanna head to the south shore."
909893,hookerdown,2015-04-13 19:28:00,110,"In tight you will find browns this time of year.  Over the last few years i have discovered that there is a residential population of Salmon around the various rivers towards the west.   Personally I think its worth doing some scouting, you will be suprised how handy the information you learn from early season scouting becomes."
909927,John Bacon,2015-04-13 23:01:00,3277,Later in the season you can head straight out to where the water drops off; not too far where you are.  You are actually in a good area for summer fishing.
909956,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-14 00:39:00,937,Good luck out there and don't forget to post pics when you find them
910003,fishindevil,2015-04-14 09:00:00,6254,It all depends on when you put your in ?? Let us know and we can keep you up to date !!! Do you have experience on the big water as well ?? A few more details will help us !!! If you can trailer your rig for a bit you can get into awesome fishing right away !!! Now !!!! If you are not putting your boat in till June or July that changes the game too !!!!
910200,duke01,2015-04-14 23:03:00,20,Early in the year we start at the river mouths and mud lines. If you are new to big water fishing this is a good way to start because it's close to shore and the methods are a little simpler. Just run cranks behind boards of different colours and distances to start. Find the warmer water and start from there. Remember it is a learning curve and have fun.
910218,fishdawg,2015-04-15 00:02:00,912,"Best way to shorten the learning curve is to hire a charter and get some hands on experience. Cheaper alternative, make friends with other recreational experienced  trollers, and get out as often as you can.  Also read up as much as you can on other sites like Spoonpullers, Lake Ontario United, and Great Lakes Angler."
