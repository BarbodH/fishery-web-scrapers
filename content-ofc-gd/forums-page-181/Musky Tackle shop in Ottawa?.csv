257132,irishfield,2008-10-10 02:41:00,26272,That would have some Legend Perch Baits in stock?  Gotta a feeling I'm gonna have some time to kill on Saturday morning while I wait for #3 child to dismantle her Architecture pavilon on the Rideau River.
257134,silveradosheriff,2008-10-10 02:48:00,1025,Sports Action 2000 is decent.  http://www.sports-action.ca
257136,irishfield,2008-10-10 02:52:00,26272,Thanks! Not too far from the University either!
257141,Mike the Pike,2008-10-10 03:22:00,3421,Only place in Ottawa I know of is Le Baron they have moved though into a nice spacious store much bigger than the Montreal store there is some Muskie stuff Wayne but not alot.Visited this summer.
257143,irishfield,2008-10-10 03:24:00,26272,Okay Thanks Mike. Figure I'm already blowin $300 for gas for two trips to Ottawa and back so she gets a good home cooked meal... a few little hooks won't increase the overal cost by much of a percentage! LOL
257175,muskymatt,2008-10-10 09:38:00,2608,"No!  Nobody in Ottawa has Legends.  There are no ""muskie shops"" in Ottawa. I wish there was but there isn't!"
257199,wallyboss,2008-10-10 11:28:00,1095,Bit's and Baits in Stittsville(just West of Ottawa) has a good selection of musky stuff.
257206,irishfield,2008-10-10 11:37:00,26272,Thanks guys.. hitting the road in 10 minutes
257223,MuskieWannabe,2008-10-10 12:25:00,79,"The best one on Ottawa is Bits and Baits...bar none!!!  If you want a lure that no one carries, talk to Gord, the owner, and he'll surely do his best to get them for you...Has done it many times for me already and his selection is growing each and every season!  If you search bits and baits online you'll find his website!"
910963,mike rousseau,2015-04-19 13:36:00,4661,Anyone been to this store lately...?  I was in Ottawa overnight and I'd like to get a couple baits...  I'm leaving soon and wondering if it's worth the 20 minute drive opposite direction if home...  Website is garbage so I can't tell what they have for musky...  Worth going?
910987,mike rousseau,2015-04-19 17:59:00,4661,Nevermind  Went  Definatley not worth the drive...
911046,Handlebarz,2015-04-19 21:55:00,3790,I know its the opposite way but Pro Tackle in belleville is totally stocked for musky fishing Stacy is a musky nut and has everything you will need and also not need there
911130,mike rousseau,2015-04-20 04:11:00,4661,Yup  Pro tackle is a great shop.... Best musky shop I've been in personally...  But I look for variety... Different shops usually mean different baits...  So I REALLY like a store that gets different lures in year to year to keep regulars coming back...   You know what I'm saying... A guy only needs so many jakes and believers... Lmao
