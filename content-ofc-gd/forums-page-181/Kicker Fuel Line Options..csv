910139,G.mech,2015-04-14 19:21:00,830,The only issue with a 3-way valve (on the main fuel line) is that you cannot run both motors at once if you ever needed to (for example I sometime run my main for a bit to charge the battery while trolling with the kicker or if you want to start and warm up you kicker while the main is running).  The fuel separator setup is good but it may be overkill in your case as you already have a filter/separator built in the main motor (and I think in the Pro-kicker as well but I may be wrong).  There is a simpler way that lots of guys use (myself included).  Just tee off the main line and have a primer bulb in hose to each engine.  The primers have check valves built inside them (that's how they work) which prevents one motor robbing the other and both can run at once.
910152,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-14 20:00:00,10439,"The 3 way valve in my installation does not isolate the the engines, just the tanks from each other. This way I know if running on the aux tank and I run out of fuel I still have 22 gallons in my main tank. I could have just plumbed the second tank into the aux input but then wouldn't have the control over where the fuel is coming from that I wanted. The unused port has a brass plug threaded into it. The housing came with two of these incase you only have one tank and motor.  "

Okay, now we're all straightened out once and for all!!!  Sorry for my part in the misunderstanding  The FI Mercs have a built in filter / water separator on board and I'm almost certain the Yammies do as well.  I'm not sure about the 9.9 pro-kicker though, my 8HP just has an in-line filter inside.  In any case, if the OP is worried about the kicker and has room to put the additional separator it's a good way to go but the 3 way valve to me is not a great way to go....  I'm going fishing now....Lookout Detroit!"

910399,FishAbout,2015-04-16 01:20:00,106,Don't add a primer ball to the fuel line on the 150. Priming them can ruin the fuel pump canister. As BillM said adding water separator is the easiest to hook up fuel lines. The filters on the motors are really just fuel filters not water separators. I install many water separators on four stroke engines at work.

They also come with a primer bulb on the main line from the factory....  Mine did not come with a primer bulb and in the installation instructions it said not to install one. It has 2 fuel pumps a lift pump which primes the system and a high pressure pump that supplies the fuel injectors with fuel. Maybe on smaller FI engines this could be the case.  My 2013 115HP 4 stroke also does not have a built in water separator as far as I know just an inline fuel filter. Of course I could be wrong here as it's been many months since I was under the cowling.  Next month she will come out for preseason maintenance though."
910677,irishfield,2015-04-17 17:54:00,26272,"You'll be glad you have a ""primer bulb"" the day your lift pump float switch calls it a day.... so that you can get home. Don't ask how I know this.. No need to use it any other time, but when your fuel module (that is mounted under the covers below the water line) has no fuel in it, that pump bulb will get you home 5 squeezes at a time! It can't hurt the operation of the engine with the pump just sucking fuel through the bulb and the worst you can do (at least on a Verado) is overfill the canister and get an alarm on your Smart gauges. Verado has a water separator that holds about a litre of water if need be and then another fine filter on the HP line. The 9.9 Pro Kicker has a simple fuel filter and no water separator. Generally shouldn't be an issue if your big engine has one... as it should have sucked the water out of the tank on the way to your fishing spot!  OP's original question... if the boat wasn't supplied with a kicker outlet, cut the hose to the main engine, put a T in it and feed the kicker. There's no rocket science needed, unless you want a water separator as Dave and Bill have shown."
910712,FishAbout,2015-04-17 21:47:00,106,Mercury does not recommended a primer bulb due to the engine having no mechanical float. If you never use the primer bulb you would be fine. I believe on the 150hp efi (non verado) has no water separator on the motor. There is a water seprator fuel filter kit for that engine that is a add on.  As a certified mercury tech I recommended the water separator as neither outboard have a water separator built into them especially the crappy ethanol in the fuel these days. Just need to replace a spin on filter once a year.
