910650,Gallie,2015-04-17 15:41:00,1215,"I also play most rounds on a cheap course near home, 18 a cart 4 canadian for about 50 bucks ? To give you an idea of the type of course i shot a 1 over 72 there last year... It also has some short 220 yard par 4s soooo lol"
910653,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 15:55:00,11391,Haha I played a course like that in ear falls for 2 years. Ive shot -6 a few times on that course. It was a nice course to just not very difficult. In fact I dont even think it had any water hazards
910654,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 15:58:00,11391,"I shot a beautiful course in virginia, water on almost every hole and very deep bunkers. I was very humbled to play a pro rated course. I think i shot about 120 or somewhere around that. Wherever there was water I found it haha. Shoulda brought a rod with me?"
910658,bigbuck,2015-04-17 16:29:00,2449,250 down the pipe is just fine. A good second shot and a decent short game and you can easily be a bogie golfer or better. Now I want to get the dust off my clubs....
910662,AKRISONER,2015-04-17 16:40:00,5558,"driving distance is a lot like sizing caught fish.  I know one guy that can drive the ball 300 and hes got a card.  I think your concerns about hitting 250 are because you are the only one being honest. The longest par 5's are only 550 yards, if you hit 250 on your drive and then 2 shots at 150 you are GIR  even on a really long par 4 at most you will be 180 out.  the best golfers i know all <10 handicap 2 putt or less every hole and dont miss from short. Scoring is done from <50 yards."
910665,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 17:02:00,11391,Im actually really good on par 5's generally. After my second shot Im usually set up for a short wedge and thats my best club.  One guy I play with easily averages 310 off the tee. Ive seen him bomb some 340-350 range too and its pretty cool too see. Thats along way! Hes a 7 handicap though and has some tourny wins under his belt.  All his clubs are long though. He hits a 56 130 yards lol. Thats just insane.  I hit mine 90 on average  Tomorrow should be a blast but interesting as well. Ive had tennis elbow for the last month so my range of motion is off. Ive had to really open up on the turn with the driver and woods. Irons im just playing a 3/4 swing or it just kills my elbow
910673,lew,2015-04-17 17:38:00,12766,"Both my son & brother were excellent golfers and consistently shot in the low 80's, but me on the other hand, I was the worlds worst golfer and only broke 100 once in my life but I had a blast playing and that's all I cared about.  I knew a guy years ago who was a member of a course out in Pickering and was always bragging about what an excellent golfer he was. He invited me to join him one day and after a couple holes I realized this doofus was as bad at me, but even worse he was a cheat. Most shots he'd end up in the woods and I'd hear him thrashing away at the ball, then when he finally get on the green it was another 3 or 4 shots to get in the hole. Trouble was though when he marked the score card he gave himself either a birdie or par on every hole  Didn't bother me though as I was having a fun day and didn't care about my score or his.  Problem was, after the game we went into the club house for a beer & samich and he started bragging to all his buds about what a great game he had and how he'd beaten the daylights out of me  and what a lousy player I was.  He didn't like it though when I explained to his buds that he was worse than me and cheated on every single hole. It was hilarious watching him try to squirm out of that one.  He never invited me out again"
910675,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 17:50:00,11391,Hahaha thats the worst lew.  One guy I shoot with 3 or 4 times a year beats me by one stroke everytime lol.  Even though he spends half the time out of bounds.  Ive even seen him put a tee in the ground and play driver attempting to reach a par 5 in two. ???
910704,blaque,2015-04-17 20:47:00,2419,"My weeknight league will be starting in a few weeks, and i cant wait. Ill also play an additional day on the weekend. And fish any day of the week that i choose.  How do I do it you ask? Simple, I opted out of the wife and 2.5 kids lifestyle"
910886,manitoubass2,2015-04-18 23:19:00,11391,"What a tough opener. 45km winds and all.  What a blast though?  I shot 85 and my boy shot 101. We made tons of good shots and had some unlucky breaks, such is golf.  Overall I think that my best opening round ever, and in harsh conditions  What a day. Great times?"
910920,chris.brock,2015-04-19 01:31:00,4053,85 is beauty! Par 72?  45 k wind is nice when it's at your back and you crush a 5 wood off the tee
910926,Gallie,2015-04-19 01:51:00,1215,"I would be pretty thrilled with an opening round 85 anywhere, particularily on a windy day"
910932,manitoubass2,2015-04-19 02:59:00,11391,"Thanks guys! It was a blast!  I even had a wicked bogey thrown in their hahaha. On a long par 3 I drove right edge of the bush. Playable but hardly any backswing and a chunk off log like 8"" in front of my ball. I had no choice but to punch out over the green.  Left it on the left edge of the bush and caught a nice bit of dead grass. Chipped up too three feet for a nice tap in bogey  Frig in those lies i coulda shot a 10 lol.  The wind was horrible. Some holes you hit and you could just watch your ball stop mid air. One hole I only drive it about 210 yards, then baaaam, just dead. No roll, deadly crosswinds etc.  Anyhow, it was a great day and man did my son hit some great shots! He coulda easily shaved 5-6 strokes with better putting today but oh well. Im not kidding 101 was a great score for a kid today. He played that low fade and outdrove alot of adults today for sure?          Last two are just practise swings. And the course was much nicer then the 9th hole looked. I was pretty shocked how good the course was this time of year  ?"
910937,manitoubass2,2015-04-19 03:32:00,11391,"Holy old man memory. Mah boy just schooled me. It was a par save on a short par 4, not a bogey on a long par 3 hahahah.  That kid dont forget anything? unlike his old man"
910942,manitoubass2,2015-04-19 05:23:00,11391, The wind never seemed at our back lol. Maybe on two or three holes and one was a par 3.  It was a great day for course management. Lots of strategy into the first round.  Oh and Bray hit a 235 yard drive? thats boss at 12 years old. His driver has improved alot! He probably averaged about 190 for the day.  Last year he sucked on the driver? seems to have figured it out now?
910503,manitoubass2,2015-04-16 18:25:00,11391,"Id imagine we have some golfers here?  Course opens tomorrow and tee time is booked for me and my son! I cant wait...  Golf to me is very much like fishing... enjoying nature, relaxing and just having fun!!!!  Love this time of year, fishing, golf and playoff hockey!!!!"
910508,BillM,2015-04-16 18:58:00,17367,I suck at golf but enjoy a round here and there.
910509,chris.brock,2015-04-16 19:21:00,4053,"Before I clicked on this I could have sworn Bill's reply was going to be ""do you wear the blue and yellow gloves for golfing too?"" Hahaha  Post some pictures Rick, it would be interesting to see what the course looks like up there, maybe even a little Fin's and Skins too"
910512,Raf,2015-04-16 19:29:00,3495,always figgered it was a one or the other thing (fishing & golf) where do you people find the time for both LOL
910514,misfish,2015-04-16 19:37:00,29133,"Hey Bill, anytime you want to get out for a walk about,let me know. Always up a few rounds a year.  Enjoy your day Rick.  LOL Chris"
910518,manitoubass2,2015-04-16 19:57:00,11391,Hahaha  Yep ill be taking some pics...  First round of the year Ill be lucky to shoot around 83 ish.  Gonna be fun!!!
910519,manitoubass2,2015-04-16 19:58:00,11391,The course is very dry.  Distance control should be fun hahah
910520,misfish,2015-04-16 20:00:00,29133, First round of the year Ill be lucky to shoot around 83 ish.  Gonna be fun!!!  Not bad for the first 9.
910523,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-16 20:23:00,2582,Love golf. Used to have a membership every year and get out tons when I worked the continental shifts with days off through the week.  Got my game down to high 80's low 90's on a real course.  Then I had kids and discovered panfish...so I golfed less. Then I started working Monday to Friday and got a cottage...so I golfed even less.  Haven't had my clubs out of the basement for 4 summers now. Just don't make the time for it anymore....BUT...when I retire I fully intend to get some other geriatric buddies  and get out at least once a week. One of the things I'm looking forward to in retirement when I have more free time. Right now it's a distant 2nd to fishing and I just don't have time for both.  Miss that sweet sound and feeling when you hit a perfect shot. It's happened twice I think
910525,AKRISONER,2015-04-16 20:26:00,5558,"i used to golf a lot in highschool, was a member at North Halton GCC in Georgetown for 3 years handicap was down into the 18 range. Now im lucky if i get out 3 times a year and break 100 ughhh. Its too friggin expensive for a 20 something with a mortgage. Im garbage but my friends are all damn good. The guy i golf with the most is a CPGA pro. Ive gotten to play some fantastic courses simply because I was with him.  Usually during a break in teh summer i get out to Parry Sound Golf and Country Club, shot my best round ever there an 87!"
910528,Gallie,2015-04-16 20:33:00,1215,I usually play 15-30 rounds a year depending on time. Most of those are on a fairly low brow course but i get out to some decent ones as well. On a good course im low 80s to low 90s depending on what my driver decides is going happen on a given day lol. You smash a couple ob early and its hard to regain those strokes on the green.
910553,manitoubass2,2015-04-16 21:44:00,11391,Hahahah  Pretty easy course that Kitchen Creek is.  That and I already have a few weeks practise in?  On a good course Id shoot low 90s for sure
910578,bigbuck,2015-04-16 23:49:00,2449,"Akrisoner, north halton is a nice track, played there a few years ago. Miss swatting at the stupid little white ball. Mortgage than kids got in the way of my game and I would not have it any other way. My clubs have been collecting dust for 3 years now. I am hoping to get out this summer."
910594,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 01:26:00,11391,Just went and hit some long irons and woods at the range...  Seems getting fat over the winter has knocked off a few yards ???
910601,captpierre,2015-04-17 02:47:00,2521,Golf. A four letter word.
910626,Headhunter,2015-04-17 12:49:00,5703,I consistently break 100 by stopping play at 99! It's been two years since I last golfed and the wife and I have decided that we will get our annual game in this year come hell or high water! HH
910628,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 12:55:00,11391,I hear ya. I learned years ago that if my driver isnt doing what I want its 3 wood off the tee. Ill sacrafice that distance for accuracy anyday.  That being said my driver has been very good the last two years. If only I could learn to consistantly hit a draw (I generally hit a fade but can hit straight when I need too).  Its weird cause I can draw all my long irons no prob.
910630,AKRISONER,2015-04-17 13:01:00,5558,"Big Buck, NH is one of my favourite courses of all time, and ive played some pretty prestigious ones.  If anyone is in the GB area Parry Sound is an unbelievably good track for a fantastic value. I suggest early tee times as pace can be horrible on a Saturday, just like any other public course.   The course itself has some absolutely stunning holes encompassing the natural rocky surroundings, I highly highly recommend it.    Guys all complaining about the driver, boys dont you remember? Shoot for show putt for dough, 60 percent of strokes are on the green!"
910633,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 13:18:00,11391,My wedges and putter are very good. Thats where I score.  All my other clubs are good too but I lack distance. Average drive for me is 250.  Thats why I need to be good on the wedges.  Probably 80% off my practise goes to wedge play
910635,Headhunter,2015-04-17 14:00:00,5703,"Nothing wrong with a 250 yd drive MB! If you can consistently land on the fairway at 250, then you are doing well! HH"
910637,Gallie,2015-04-17 14:12:00,1215,"My short game is also pretty tight, but at 6' 250 and golfing with a guy who played all his life i have to show what i got with the big stick? I average around 270-280 but have crushed a few well over 300. I have also never seen a dog leg right that i didnt think i could get over lol. Golfing is about consistency and i just dont have that so i have a couple drinks and a good time and let the game play out as it will."
910639,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 14:21:00,11391,"True enough.  Id really like to get back to about 265, and I think I will this year as I loose some weight and practise.  My 12 year old is obsessed with golf so we get out quite abit in the last 2 seasons. Hes a natural. Cant wait until his lessons this year. He shoots about 93 from the mens tees but last year his best round was 87 which is a friggen miracle.  In my younger days I could hit 280ish but I was WAY more athletic then lol.  But on kitchen creek I can still drive two greens, one is 305 to the front the other is 290. Not sure why but I always drive really good on those two holes.  Then one hole I cant drive 230 haha. No idea why  Golf, shes a funny game"
910642,Acountdeleted,2015-04-17 14:59:00,2562,Where do you guys find the money for both?
910646,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 15:17:00,11391,"I think most of us posting are a lil older then you Jeremy. My wife and I both work in good fields, but we manage our money well.  Also green fees around here are pretty good. $35 for 18, so with a cart, some good eats and a few beers(if thats your thing its like $80 for a round.  I get my son and I a membership and it cost 850 in total"
910648,manitoubass2,2015-04-17 15:19:00,11391,And I live in earshot of 3 waterbodies. Heck I can golf in the morning and fish all afternoon?
