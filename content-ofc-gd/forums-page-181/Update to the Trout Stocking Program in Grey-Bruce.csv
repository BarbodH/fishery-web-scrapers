As a kid we often went to the pond at the St.Williams Forestry Station and nursery as a family picnic. At first Brookies were the species caught, early 60's a few years later they changed to Rainbows. The Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority pond at St. Johns was the same, I could bike there and it opened about 1960 and had specs in it for a few years and then switched to bows."
