910783,KraTToR,2015-04-18 11:55:00,506,Just picked up a new grp 24 deep cycle that I'm installing as a house battery and I noticed that the electrolyte level was low.  Is this normal for a new battery?  I bought it at costco - $95 plus $10 core.  Each level was about the same so I just brought it up to the appropriate level with distilled and hooked it up to the charger.

I need to get two new batteries - went into my local Costco but they did not have any (nor was there any indication/price tags on the shelves).  Wondering if they don't show up until later - or if I will need to go to a different warehouse.
