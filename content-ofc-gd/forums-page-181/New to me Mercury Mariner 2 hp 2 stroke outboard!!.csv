902160,leaf4,2015-03-07 22:01:00,2466,"I have an old 2 stroke 4 horse from the 60's I know what you mean by loud lol, nice buy"
902161,northernpike56,2015-03-07 22:03:00,717,"I also have a 30 lb thrust minn kota as well as a massive marine battery and smart-charger, so I'm covered for any of those stealth situations where you gotta sneak up on the fish as well. That thing is just annoying because the battery will drain after a couple hours of trolling, hence why I got the gasoline motor"
902167,solopaddler,2015-03-07 22:37:00,8605,"I had a 2 horse 2 stroke Yamaha for years, amazing motor. It shouldn't sound quite as loud when it's in the water running, but yeah they're a tad noisy. I'd run some seafoam through it if it was me."
902178,northernpike56,2015-03-08 00:12:00,717,"That sounds like an idea!, I keep on hearing all these guys raving about how great seafoam is for cleaning up engines. Would I just be mixing it in with the gasoline and letting the motor burn through a full tank? Should be quite the smokey show me thinks."
902188,chris.brock,2015-03-08 01:04:00,4053,"You're not going to go through much gas with that little outboard so it might be a good idea to run seafoam all the time, can't hurt, only help, it won't be smokey,  premium, no ethanol gas for sure  I'm far from an expert but have had outboards all my life, I'm close in Oakville if you want to bring it by and we'll run it in a barrel and check it out, I promise I won't try to steal it"

Would I just be mixing it in with the gasoline and letting the motor burn through a full tank? Should be quite the smokey show me thinks. Yep add some to the gas and let it run for a while."

910812,northernpike56,2015-04-18 15:50:00,717,"Hi guys,  What type of lower end gear oil does everybody use for their small outboards?  Also, how frequently should I be changing the water pump/impeller? I've heard around every two seasons is good but want to be sure!  Thanks!"
910854,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-18 21:25:00,10439,I run the Mercury stuff in my new engine but just run the stuff from Canadian Tire in my older engines. I change lower unit oil in the fall when putting the boat away for the winter. Depending on how much use your engine gets and the quality of the water you run in will dictate how often you need to replace your impeller. I generally wait longer and replace about every 5 years. I don't suck a lot of dirt or mud in my engine though. The guys out West that run glacial rivers need to replace them every year because of all the silt in the water. If you don't use the motor for a long time the impeller will take a set and not seal as well any more.
910872,chris.brock,2015-04-18 22:53:00,4053,"I just use Can Tire gear oil. If it's milky, water is getting in and I change it often, if it looks good, I only change it once a year.  if it's peeing good I don't replace impellers as regular maintenance."
900901,northernpike56,2015-03-02 04:21:00,717,"Hi guys, I bought a Mariner 2 hp 2 stroke outboard for my aluminum sportspal canoe off kijiji this weekend, it looks like it's in mint condition. I was shown how to start it up, and what fuel mixture I should be using (50:1), but other than that, I know absolutely nothing about the motor.  If/when in the future I need to buy parts to replace on it, or even just a new spark plug every so often, how would I go about determining what to buy, and who to buy it from online? I know these motors are fairly common, so there must be an abundance of guys working on them and used parts of sale.  If anybody has any insight on what this motor actually is (model), I'd love to get any advice from you guys!  Thanks,  Matt  Picture of my new motor! "
900903,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-02 04:28:00,10439,You can pick up plugs at Canadian Tire. FYI you will need the serial # of the motor in order to get parts for it. You should still be able to get some parts at your local Mercury Marine parts counter. Here are a few links for getting other parts: http://www.marineparts.com/PARTSPAGES/mercurymariner.htm  http://www.usboatsupply.com/outboard-parts.php  http://www.maxrules.com/fixmercindex.html
900905,northernpike56,2015-03-02 04:40:00,717,"Cool Thanks!!, next time I'm out in the garage I'll pull off the cowling and write down what the serial number for the model is. Can't seem to find it on the surface of the motor"
900915,Freshtrax,2015-03-02 06:18:00,2215,Sweet lil motor!
900917,skeeter99,2015-03-02 08:35:00,109,"Cool Thanks!!, next time I'm out in the garage I'll pull off the cowling and write down what the serial number for the model is. Can't seem to find it on the surface of the motor  All the info you need is in your first pic on the serial number plate, you aint gonna find anything taking the cowling off  look to where tiller handle meets the cowling and look down to the black and silver plate in you pic that is the serial # plate and info for parts"
900929,chris.brock,2015-03-02 12:10:00,4053,"Great score! Never sell that thing (except to me  ), keep it in the family.  Does it have neutral? Neutral is a huge plus.  edit- see if it's made in Japan, Yamaha made some small outboards for Merc and Mariner and they were solid"
901077,John Bacon,2015-03-02 22:18:00,3277,"I think it may be a Tohatsu.  It looks very similar to my 2.5 hp Nissan.  Tohatsu makes motors for Nissan, Mercury, and Evinrude."
901098,Sinker,2015-03-03 00:22:00,8692,"Id say thats a yamaha built mariner myself. If the plate says made in japan, its usually a yamaha. Your parts will be yamaha parts. That is a great little engine. Like Chris said, dont ever part with it.  Any idea what year it is? The serial and model number on the plate will tell you everything.  Good score!  S."
901134,Joeytier,2015-03-03 04:39:00,3990,Cool little motor!!  Does it have a built in fuel tank?  I've thought about seeing how fast I could get my sportspal movin' with my 5hp merc!
901438,chris.brock,2015-03-04 02:49:00,4053,"It would be built in fuel tank. We put a 9.9 on a 10'  sportspal with a tiller extension handle thing so you could sit in the middle, and slowly took it up to WOT. It went like a dart, but revved out. A bigger pitch prop would have been interesting."
901474,northernpike56,2015-03-04 04:20:00,717,"To rub it in even more, I got it for 250 bucks! My sportspal canoe I got for 500 bucks and it is in mint condition. Kijiji is amazing, you just gotta keep your eyes peeled for the real deal.  I looked at the motor more closely, and the model is a Mariner 2M 6A1. Seems to be a fairly common little motor as a google search yielded a ton of results"
901477,northernpike56,2015-03-04 04:32:00,717,"Mariner 2M 6A1 039007, says made in Japan. I found a pdf document online, and it says that the motor should either be a 1982 or 1983 Japanese sourced!"
901506,Sinker,2015-03-04 13:32:00,8692,"Yep, as suspected, its a yamaha.  Great engine.  S."
901611,mepps,2015-03-04 21:50:00,1301,"Looks like a great little motor. I've been using an old 1978 Johnson for a few years. My friend and I took it apart and rebuilt most of it - I was surprised how easy it was. Getting parts for my older unit was somewhat difficult, but I'm sure yours should be pretty easy."
901653,livinisfishin,2015-03-05 01:01:00,661,"A couple years back i traded an xbox for a 3.5 hp merc 1983 built in tank. Its been a pretty good engine to me . I can push my 16' starcraft around when i want to troll and its dirt cheap to fill it lol. The only thing I dont like about mine is that there is no lower cowling, the upper is held on by the fuel tank cap and the guts are exposes below the cowling. Always used to worry about water getting in there but hasnt been a problem so far. Your motor looks mint..nice find!"
901843,Can_38,2015-03-06 01:19:00,152,"Jealous, great find."

901886,northernpike56,2015-03-06 05:02:00,717,"Since we've determined this motor is Japanese, I'm guessing all wrenches and socket sizes needed will be metric (mm)?"

901889,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-06 05:22:00,8243,My cousin tried to kill himself and his little tyke by strapping a 20 HP Merc on the back of his 7 foot inflatable and pulled the kid on skis. The only person near death was him when his wife found out that the 7 year old had to sit up front to act as a ballast.  Find something an engine can be attached to and man will find a way to race it. I never thought a canoer could be charged for creating a wake in a no wake zone.  Great score by the way. That would be a perfect match for Featherstone Teds 90 Mariner as the kicker. $250.00!!!!!
902147,northernpike56,2015-03-07 21:07:00,717,"Today is nice and warm so I filled up a garbage can with water and tried to start my motor in there. Full tank of fuel and it won't start after a bunch of tries. It almost sounds like its not getting any fuel delivered to it, and I'm not seeing any exhaust fumes or smoke. Any suggestions?"
902150,lew,2015-03-07 21:12:00,12766,Did you choke it ?
902151,northernpike56,2015-03-07 21:15:00,717,"Yep! Turned on choke when I'm trying to start it, choke off all other times (I heard that you can ""flood"" an engine by leaving it on?)"
902154,lew,2015-03-07 21:37:00,12766,If you've never seen this motor run it could be alot of different things but start out with the easy things 1st.  Check the plug and make sure it's clean then snug it up and be sure the lead is on tight.
