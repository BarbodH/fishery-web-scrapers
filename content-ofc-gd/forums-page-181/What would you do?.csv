911172,G.mech,2015-04-20 13:30:00,830,I think she is kind of cute and has a very soothing voice so I think I would have asked her out for a drink or supper maybe....

What she did is against the law, call the cops so that she doesn't do it again."
911227,Beavertail,2015-04-20 16:26:00,331,"That article made my day, love it!! The guys in the original clip hopefully do the same...the woman even states her own name, can't make it much easier for them. She also states that ""she understands that decoys are illegal, and their blinds help them shoot at people and any innocent animals passing by...."" Just goes to show how ignorant and uneducated some people are, especially when it involves hunting."
911230,BillM,2015-04-20 16:32:00,17367,See what happens when you eat lead paint chips as a kid?  Let's hope she didn't procreate.
911232,Terry,2015-04-20 16:37:00,14456,"I would have called the police on her and  the mnr , then I would follow her home and insist on charges being laid"

910875,misfish,2015-04-18 23:03:00,29133,For real?  Whats her real problem?
910879,livinisfishin,2015-04-18 23:08:00,661,Wow that was different. I would react the same way the camera man did. The drama just wouldnt be worth it.
910880,bigugli,2015-04-18 23:08:00,6138,"Your hunting day is already shot.  Follow her to vehicle or home, then file a formal complaint with both the police and the MNRF. You've got the video evidence to back up the complaint. No different than using video to make an example of the muskie idiot"
910881,kickingfrog,2015-04-18 23:10:00,8333,Assuming she is harassing hunters that are legal (Don't know that for sure but I'm guessing that's why they were filming her.)  On top of that. Is she trespassing? Does she have her dogs running loose in an area where game is present?
910885,bigugli,2015-04-18 23:14:00,6138,"After putting that up on full screen, She looks a lot like my sister in law. This wasn't up Ottawa way by chance??????"
910888,Entropy,2015-04-18 23:31:00,747,"not sure where it was, it just came across my 'feed'.  I almost assume I will be in this situation one day.  With all the city folk moving out to the country, I feel it is almost certain to happen around my neck of the woods."

910894,Bondar,2015-04-18 23:58:00,817,"She's lucky these guys were calm, pretty brave walking through there I'd bet that coo coo gets trouble before the legal hunters"
910895,irishfield,2015-04-19 00:03:00,26272,Nothing worse than a vegetarian off her meds!
910896,Beavertail,2015-04-19 00:13:00,331,"Good on the hunter for keeping his cool and taking the high road...not so sure I could have done the same. If I had permission to be there, wasn't breaking any laws, spent time and money scouting and setting up a decoy spread only to have that idiot ruin it, I'd be seeing red."
910898,dave524,2015-04-19 00:17:00,4508,"Call the C.O. she can be charged for interfering with a legal hunt, video is evidence."
910940,HTHM,2015-04-19 04:06:00,4082,"I doubt this was in Ontario, she referred to calling RCMP. I hope they responded and charge her."
910943,Roe Bag,2015-04-19 05:25:00,246,"Typical TREE HUGGER.  Part of the same group that thinks commorants should be protected.  Doesn't matter  that a commorant eats it's own weight in fish daily. Nor does it matter that their excrement kills everything they decide to roost in.  Sadly the MNR backs the likes of these people. Commorants are protected yet they continue to destroy our fisheries. As for Canada geese, there is a river walk in my town. The goose poop is unbelievable. Soon our waterways will be so polluted, safe drinking water will be a thing of the past."
910944,manitoubass2,2015-04-19 05:43:00,11391,Wow!   Even her dogs wouldnt listen to her???  Whoever that guy was he handled it well.  Unreal how some peoples thought processes are.  This lady is obviously strong in her stance to approach supposed legal hunters with guns.  Gnarly
910950,OhioFisherman,2015-04-19 12:24:00,6623,"I don't get her complaint? "" You shouldn't be hunting this close to people's homes? "" What may have been a home was off in the distance, and if they were using shotguns as goose decoys would suggest? It's a bit hard to get a clear idea of the scale of distance, but I can make out homes here a half a mile away at least, out of range for shotguns?  If they had permission to hunt the land and were legal? I didn't see anything that showed they weren't? Prozac?"
910979,Sinker,2015-04-19 17:00:00,8692,"It happens from time to time. All you can do is call the cops, but that just takes up more time, so I just let the freaks say their thing, and laugh as they leave. Pure ignorance right there.  S."
911108,Rod Caster,2015-04-20 02:16:00,5784,Wow!   Even her dogs wouldnt listen to her   haha I thought the same thing  I wonder how many worms and bugs she stepped on during her walk. MURDERER!!!
911125,Acountdeleted,2015-04-20 03:14:00,2562,"Bet she wasn't even a vegetarian. Probably went home and had a steak. As long as she didn't kill it, it's not helpless."
911129,Sinker,2015-04-20 04:08:00,8692,Id rather have her show up than be held at gunpoint by a swat team!!  True story!!  Even the authorities dont know all the rules sometimes.  Most people thing guns=bad!  S.
911132,manitoubass2,2015-04-20 06:02:00,11391,Guns are sooo bad
911142,Mister G,2015-04-20 11:50:00,1429,Judging from the only what the video showed they didn't do their home work on that spot. No blinds seen and they should of had some dead geese by that time. Maybe she did them a favor to seek more a fruitful area. Scouting the evening before really pays off in morning.  BTW my lab would of NEVER let her or her dog(s) get that close to us.
911145,Beavertail,2015-04-20 11:58:00,331,"If you watch the video closely they did have blinds...pop-up blinds. And in no way, shape or form did she do them a favour."
911146,NAW,2015-04-20 12:06:00,4022,"I hunt a lot of waterfowl.  And I always try to select spots where I'm not going to cause a situation like that.  Saturday morning, being woke up by 12 gauge blasts at 6 am.  It can be extremely loud and disruptive if there are houses near by.  She did say, you shouldn't be hunting this close to people homes in the video.  Who knows, maybe there are houses and/or a full subdivision right on the other side of those trees?  Maybe the hunters are shooting directly at the houses?  Maybe the hunters are trespassing?  Maybe their steel shot is raining down on a new steel roof?  I have seen all of these things happen (Literally).  The hunter did the right thing by keeping his cool and getting it on video.  The woman is obviously pissed.  What she should have done, is contact the land owner to find out if they have been granted written permission to hunt the land.  Get the vehicle information from the hunters vehicle, and go from there.  She's an idiot for interfering with their hunt, and could be charged.  But she may have valid reasons to be pissed off.  Some hunters are completely ignorant asses.  I have been shocked, completely mind boggled actually, at the actions of some hunters.  Hell, I've been shot several times while duck hunting..."
911167,BillM,2015-04-20 13:04:00,17367,"I would have laughed at her, what else can you do?"
