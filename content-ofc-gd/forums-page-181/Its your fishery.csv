906500,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-28 00:58:00,265,"I know about Bluffers Browns.....its no fishery, but then again it depends on what your idea of a ""fishery"" is.  Mine certainly isnt the odd fish or two roaming around North Shore.  The MNR's data is wrong.  It just backs up their decisions to stock off break walls or harbours.  Any bio with a head on their shoulders know that fish should be imprinted in rivers to keep them localized or at least part of the time but even then it doesn't mean they will stick around.   For every theory that proves x there is a theory that proves y.  Like I said, there is a fishery on the south shore because of the warm water but stocking more wont change anything.  They will migrate to NY waters where the bait is most plentiful.  And the ones that do come over to the CDN side is because the warm water also does spill into the south shore via the various water ways.  NY takes advantage of what they have to create fisheries.  The brown trout fishery on the NY side is world class.  They know they will stay close to home because of the conditions the lake offers.  It creates an amazing Spring, Fall and Winter fishery in the lake and in the rivers."

The only two amazing fisheries that I can think of are on the Credit River (thanks to CRAA) and the Saugeen River (thanks to the Ontario Steelheaders).  I cant really think of any amazing fisheries that the MNR has provided.  I am highly sceptical of their science.   Just because they print it, doesn't mean its right.  Science is highly subjective depending on the bio or company orchestrating the research.  Explain the amazing Brown Trout fishery on the Oak Orchard River or 18 Mile Creek and other NY tributaries.  They stock browns in those rivers and they return year after year.    You can wish in one hand and crap in another, and see which one gets filled first.  Sorry, MNR data is flawed."

I catch Browns off the pier in July when the lake flips, the Browns are here all summer but only a few fish them, everybody wants the Kings. The Browns generally are in around 70'-100' of water away from schooling kings, they don't hit meat rigs, spin doctors, magnum spoons the fish are there. John is right the fish don't migrate around the lake like Salmon, they don't move to the blue zone like Steelhead and the reason NYS has so many is because they stock the crap out of those tribs. The MNR is following the US practice of Stocking lots of Browns in certain areas to create a viable fishery."

Thats a great thing to teach a kid; ""stick to the lakes son, don't meet other anglers that share your same interests"".  Yeah right!  You can stick to your lakes if being alone is what makes you happy.  I want to see positive change for our fishery; unfortunately I've seen the ball dropped many times over by the MNR.  Anyone who has been involved in some form of management group or stakeholder committee knows the hurdles that need to be jumped and red tape that needs to be cut in order to put opportunities for anglers to enjoy.   The politics involved are horrendous speaking from actual experience.  I am curious though as to how many guys on this board participate in giving back to our resource?

Every spring we volunteer at the sturgeon hatchery(amazing experience for the kids).  Im not bashing the river steelheaders. Heck if I could find a place in the bush where I was totally sucluded it sounds like a great time/experience.  but all the talk and stories of people fighting and littering and lopping fish up on the bank to die, its all just such a major turnoff.

Once in a blue Moon a supplier would take us out on Erie or Ontario for a day otherwise it was tough $$ wise. From the Niagara to the St. Mary's river, from the Quebec border to where the Maitland River ends. Great exercise, met great people and was able to get out of the plant and the city. for a few hours or a few days. Fortunately it's now it's from the boat. It kills me to hear  people that love the same sport argue as to what is the best way to enjoy it.

Most will drop out of a river unless they are above a barrier as the water gets too warm and its in their dna to migrate. The browns we stock in the credit are from gametes of the migratory kind grown from eggs to smolts and stocked below norval. In the last few years the numbers of nice browns caught in the lower/mid credit are returning adults of the ones we stocked over the last 5-7 years in decent numbers. We are talking about the possble inshore stocking of browns around credit/humber area to possibly create a super awesome brown fishery for all to enjoy but the biggest hurdle is the cold north shore waters.

Second, I am referring to S/S stream guy who always seems to have ""their"" opinion on how others should not keep fish, etc.........and then become angry when others don't do as they think.  That's all I'm saying The lake guys are mostly clueless when it comes to anything upstream of the harbour.   Most river guys know what it takes to make a great fishery.

906495,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-28 00:25:00,265,"Browns are on the south shore because of the warm water, plain and simple.  The four sisters is a perfect example as is Pickering  Nuke Plant (there wasn't much stocking going on at the four sisters), but Browns found the warm water at the four sisters and it provided them food which provided a fishery.  When the four sisters stopped discharging warm water, the browns left.  Explain otherwise???  Find warm water and browns will be there regardless of stocking.  Browns are opportunistic feeders, where there is bait, browns will be there.  Lake Erie warms and discharges into Lake Ontario via the Niagara River, Welland Canal and Port Dalhousie.  The warm water attracts bait and the browns follow.  Thats why there are Browns there.  The south shore of Lake Ontario receives some of this warm water discharge from lake Erie but the majority goes over to the NY side (watch satellite imagery occasionally and you'll see).  When its blown across the  south shoreline, the browns will migrate up all the way toward Hamilton Harbour and close to Bronte.  The only true way to keep Browns in an area is to imprint them into a river and capture them there or around the piers during their migration to spawn.  Other than that, dumping off of break walls or harbours will not keep them there.  Its not rocket science guys, its nature.  Fish are simple creatures to figure out.  My point is, you can stock more browns, but they will migrate to the water that offers the most food which is on the US side of the south shore."

So where are all the Browns going that are currently being stocked off the break walls on the North Shore year after year?  Shouldn't there be a fishery after all these years of stocking?  They are there; they just aren't targetted as much as salmon and steelhead.  E.g. Bluffers gets lots of browns; but not a lot of people fishing for them.  There is a fishery for browns along the north shore.  Bluffers Park has lots of browns, they just aren't targetted."

905947,chessy,2015-03-25 16:33:00,610,we already do have a amazing fishing in the lake and rivers... as far as stocking i do not belive we need stocked fish in lake ontario the salmon and trout seem to be doing fine with out the help of hatchery fish .. close the hatcheryies and give money to co ..... there is lots of info there like the ganaraska strain rainbow trout in the rivers in gaspa que interfering with atlantic salmon ..
905949,BillM,2015-03-25 16:50:00,17367,"Improve the spawning habitat, the fish will take care of the rest.  If you want mutant stockers, New York is a short drive."
905958,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-25 17:40:00,265,"Yup, I agree 100%.  The water on our side of the border can boast world record numbers, even more than NY stocked rivers.  There is sooooo much potential.  Unfortunately, the MNR's answer to fish shortage is stocking, as opposed to taking down barriers and letting salmon and trout do their thang!  Just think, if the dams were down on the Credit and Bronte, the west end would be an amazing year around fishery with thousands of fish in the rivers at all times.   Port Credit's nick name is Salmon capital of the world......give me a break.  There are hardly any returns which makes for a garbage summer and fall fishery for the boat anglers.  That pen project's are a joke.  MNR needs to give their heads a shake.  Take down dams, get fish access and hire a CO.  Rocket science eh!?! Stop wasting money on stocking when fish can do it better than we can."
906001,chris.brock,2015-03-25 22:26:00,4053,"Just think, if the dams were down on the Credit and Bronte, the west end would be an amazing year around fishery with thousands of fish in the rivers at all times.  vxp/\  There isn't any significant road blocks for a salmonid on the Bronte. I've paddled it quite a few times. There's a low dam at Lowville and a weird structure at Sidrabeen the fish easily get past.  I think it will always be a put and take fishery. These are originally ocean dwelling, west coast fish."
906004,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-25 22:47:00,265,"Im not to sure what you mean by ""these are originally ocean dwelling, west coast fish"".  Steelhead and rainbow trout have proven to reproduce quite well on the Great Lake tribs.  They can thrive just as well here and provide a fantastic fishery.  As for Bronte, on low water years, the dams are more difficult to pass.  A few years of low water can wipe out a decent run quickly. Bronte has a lot of problems, and water being one of them.  Too many water permits on that trib."
906006,John Bacon,2015-03-25 22:49:00,3277,"salmon and trout seem to be doing fine with out the help of hatchery fish  I am not sure where you are comming from.  Between Canada and the U.S. there are approximately five million trout and salmon stocked into Lake Ontario each year.  How can you say they are doing well without the help of hatchery fish when there are ~5 million hatchery fish added to the system each year?  Granted, there are some specific rivers that do well without stocking; but the lake as whole receives plenty of stocking.

Port Credit's nick name is Salmon capital of the world......give me a break.  There are hardly any returns which makes for a garbage summer and fall fishery for the boat anglers.  That pen project's are a joke.   There are plenty of returns to the Credit River.  That is where all the eggs are collected for the Chinook and coho stocking programs.  I would like to see the coho passed over the dams on the Credit; but the MNR would prefer to keep it as a put an take fishery.  The pen projects do server their purpose.  They have been shown to produce larger fish for release and increase returns to the areas where they are stocked.  They are not the best way to create a self sustaining fishery; but it does create fishing opportunities where we don't have good rivers to spawning."
906007,chris.brock,2015-03-25 22:52:00,4053,"What dams?  By paddling the whole thing I've seen the whole thing, private property and all."
906011,chessy,2015-03-25 23:10:00,610,And by stocking fish ontop of wild populations you destroy the wild or natulized runs. The U.S. tocks lots of fish  and most of the stocking comes from Toronto west. Let those fish up the credit River and you will have even more fish. Hatchery fish only prove that we can destroy habitat and tell people don't worry we can grow em  and that is truly sad.   The Atlantic program in schools does the same thing.  Hey kids don't worry about the environment look we can grow a extinct fish in our class.  Now that's a great lesson.
906013,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-25 23:16:00,265," I am not sure where you are comming from.

They are not the best way to create a self sustaining fishery; but it does create fishing opportunities where we don't have good rivers to spawning. Anyone who fishes the Credit or has a bit of knowledge of the river in a whole, absolutely knows that the Salmon runs on the Credit are pathetic.  They have been decreasing for years.  The MNR gathers their eggs from that location only because its the safest place to do so, not because the Credit has so many.  1000 adult Salmon take up a lot of real estate below the Streetsville dam.  Do you fish the Credit?  If you are just a volunteer who helps with egg collections at the dam, then you know that the only fish you are seeing are right at the dam, in the fishway, and around the bend downriver.  The rest of the river is void of fish.  FACT!  Any good river would boast 10-30k of Pacific Salmon.  If Salmon could make it above Streetsville, then we would have insane numbers of Pacific returns.  The habitat is suitable for reproduction of Pacific Salmon below Norval, and because the smolts are out in the spring, there is no concern of the river temperature affecting the offspring.  Steelhead are a different story, they need cold water, and above Norval they should be going.  We will have to agree to disagree on the Pen Project.  Yes, they do create a few fish back, at best would be a 10% return.  So at 5000 smolts in total, with a maximum of 500 adult returning fish, it does little as far as I'm concerned.  When you think of all the time, money, man hours, logistics etc to make that happen when 100 pairs of Salmon could reproduce those returns without lifting a finger.  It makes no sense to me whatsoever.  Let them swim.....is that so difficult."
906023,John Bacon,2015-03-26 00:09:00,3277,The U.S. tocks lots of fish and most of the stocking comes from Toronto west.  The U.S. does not get any fish from Toronto West.  Their salmon come from the Salmon River.  They probably have a brood stock for bows and browns.
906047,chessy,2015-03-26 01:57:00,610,No what I was saying is most fish are stocked west of Toronto is what I ment.  Let them breed
906107,fishdawg,2015-03-26 16:04:00,912,Hopefully many of you are able to attend tonight's meeting or perhaps you have been to one already.
906255,Mister G,2015-03-27 09:37:00,1429,"Steelhead / Salmon guy that fishes rivers and streams I have learned are anglers who really think they have all the answers even though they don't. If all stocking programs ceased and the fish were to fend for themselves via natural spawn, the fishery would crash hard and then S/S guy would be up in arms complaining about that.  I am so glad I am not a S/S guy because most of them seem very angry about something all the time."
906278,Fish Farmer,2015-03-27 12:45:00,2234,"Was a very good meeting, I was surprised at the attendance, I thought there would have been more people. Just seems the young don't care anymore, most people in the room were old anglers. I thank Andy Todd and the other speakers for your work. Please fill out the stocking plan form, It's for us."
906279,BillM,2015-03-27 12:49:00,17367,"Steelhead / Salmon guy that fishes rivers and streams I have learned are anglers who really think they have all the answers even though they don't.

I am so glad I am not a S/S guy because most of them seem very angry about something all the time.  Just a sec...   You don't fish for steelhead, but you're in here telling us that stocking is the answer? And that if we don't stock, the fishery would crash hard?     That's a bit ironic no?"
906280,Mister G,2015-03-27 12:58:00,1429,"Not really Billy, I should say I don't fish them in the streams / rivers but do enjoy fishing them in the lake."
906285,Sinker,2015-03-27 13:15:00,8692,Can anyone sum up what was discussed at the meeting?  S.
906357,chessy,2015-03-27 16:45:00,610,Mister g. Wow what a statement.    Go to you tube and watch. The Montana story 40 years in making  then come back in here and say the se and its proven that most of the bows are being killed in the lake not shore.  I have no problem with boats. I wish they had kept the limit to 5 bows for you guys cause you are killing a hell of a lot more fish now with catch and release. We see that with all the deformed faces from having the hooks ripped out of there faces
906381,Mister G,2015-03-27 17:34:00,1429,"chessy, I think you may not be understanding my view point.  First, if I catch a steelhead in the lake I keep it for my smoker unless it's too small.  Second, I am referring to S/S stream guy who always seems to have ""their"" opinion on how others should not keep fish, etc.........and then become angry when others don't do as they think.  That's all I'm saying"
906393,Sinker,2015-03-27 19:09:00,8692,"Doesn't that prove that catch and release works??  I couldn't make it to the meeting, and I'd love to hear what was discussed and what the plan is now. Anyone??  S."
906395,John Bacon,2015-03-27 19:21:00,3277,"Doesn't that prove that catch and release works??  I couldn't make it to the meeting, and I'd love to hear what was discussed and what the plan is now. Anyone??  S.  I was at the Whitby meeting.  The stocking will continue.  There may be a few changes."
