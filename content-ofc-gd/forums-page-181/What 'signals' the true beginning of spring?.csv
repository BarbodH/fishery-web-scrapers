910473,AKRISONER,2015-04-16 16:20:00,5558,"I walk my dog every morning and its awesome to see the changes of seasons  for me it was the arrival of birds every morning it seemed a new species showed up at the park. The cardinals came first, then the sparrows, then the robins. After that rain last week the nightcrawlers were out and the robins were gorging."
903723,Sinker,2015-03-15 13:42:00,8692,I thought for sure your reply would have been something else. I guess we can discuss it at the spot in a few weeks. I'll make sure you get your syrup this year  S.
903725,BillM,2015-03-15 13:45:00,17367,"Wayne, you just took my parking spot!"
903746,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-15 15:52:00,2582,I thought for sure your reply would have been something else. I guess we can discuss it at the spot in a few weeks. I'll make sure you get your syrup this year  S. You are soooooo  correct my friend. Pretty hard to just pick one thing that makes it spring. That spot means spring to me with regards to fishing. Probably my favourite place on the planet for 1-2 weeks every year. I'm thinking it will be a month away rather then a few weeks but it will come.  The maple syrup would be a nice added bonus. I hear it goes good will a pail of perch cream
903747,Sinker,2015-03-15 15:54:00,8692,"Yeah, a few weeks was me being an optimist lol"
903756,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-15 16:51:00,10439,Well we had a blizzard warning here yesterday. High winds and a little snow but it was fairly warm. Now it's -26 with -40 wind chill. I'm sittin' on the couch watchin' hockey.

909951,irishfield,2015-04-14 00:19:00,26272,14 hour days in the hangar is usually a fair sign that it's Spring around here...

910233,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-15 01:03:00,10439,"The sure sign of spring here is when the first batch of skitters arrives. Usually there is still ice on the lakes and these slow, dumb pterodactyl sized skitters hatch. They are easy to defend against since they are slow and the numbers are low. The later hatches are another story. They are small fighter plane fast bugs that come in huge squadrons!!!!"
910240,Beavertail,2015-04-15 01:39:00,331,"While out this evening I heard spring peepers and saw big, tom Turkeys in full strut showing off for their hens...what a display!"

910297,Beavertail,2015-04-15 14:54:00,331,"Thanks for the kind offer! Think I'll be able to manage somehow though! ?They'll probably be scarce once the season opens anyway...that's how it always goes, but last night they were definitely out in full force."
910302,Mister G,2015-04-15 15:34:00,1429,"Leafs on the golf course!!! I have heard of these things call ""golf course"" but never really seen one. A friend of mine heard they were built for those who failed at fishing......"

903470,mike rousseau,2015-03-14 00:58:00,4661,Yup...  We call em bullhead... They're small catfish.... A 2 pounder would be big  They come in the creeks and bite day and night... So you can fish em whenever you want... All you need is a hook and worm. and weight... I like using a float too...
903479,moxie,2015-03-14 01:44:00,1566,Spring for me starts when I see my first robin. Yes we get them this far North. Thats what does it for me. Get goose bumps when I hear the first one sing.

Or that they had a ""run"". I'll have to check em out whilst I'm waiting for other species to open"
903512,Gerritt,2015-03-14 04:26:00,6129,"For me it is Robins, seeing the deer come out from the bush trying to forage.... Had 14 this afternoon...  And the sound of the ice/snow running down the downspout from the eves..... Love that sound.  G"

903520,lew,2015-03-14 09:41:00,12766,I was just out on the back deck and it's raining and 1st thing I thought of was this post.  Nice mild temps and the 1st rain of the year is always a good sign that winter is on the way out...and that's a good thing

Like mentioned in a previous post, I'm sure this mild weather is just a preview but I'm liking what I see so far! Can't wait to hear those Spring Peepers, then it's official."

903591,mike rousseau,2015-03-14 18:52:00,4661,Yup  I've seen them school up in creeks in such numbers that if you drive your boat up the creek you have hundreds of them swimming and jumping in front of the boat... Almost like Asian carp..  They also school up in bays..  As a starting point... Anywhere I've found crappie there have been bullhead around
903594,Rizzo,2015-03-14 19:20:00,4754,my cat gets outside for the first time in months and brings back a freshly-killed bird within 2 minutes...new record
903696,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-15 03:14:00,2582,"2 things that make it ""spring"" for me. One.... first time my tiller gets out and tills up my veggie garden. Nothing better then a spring day with the tiller going, birds chirping and the smell of freshly tilled earth. God I love that day every year. Two...when my tarragon plants at the back door are about 12 inches tall. That means bullheads and crappie are a no brainer in a couple of my spring spots"
903701,danc,2015-03-15 03:31:00,4677,"For me, spring starts when I can launch my boat at the lake of my choice. This was my chosen launch last May long. Yup. One week from June. So spring starts in June for me.  "

903361,lew,2015-03-13 19:35:00,12766,I've been working outside around the house the last 4 days wearing shorts & running shoes and that's always a good thing.  Also nice having the warm sun coming thru the windows and not needing the furnace.

Definitely was a nice preview, but its not spring to me until I can put a boat in the water.
