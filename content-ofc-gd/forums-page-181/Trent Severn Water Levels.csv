Easy to sit and slag them from behind your computer screen, with virtually no understanding of the conditions that led to what is happening right now. They have ""no win"" jobs: if they hold water back, the folks downstream moan about the lack of water. If they let water through, the cottagers on the upper lakes moan about their lake being low. If the rivers are running high in the spring, everyone in Minden starts panicking, remembering the big flood. No matter what they do, someone wants to call an inquiry."

910988,Big Cliff,2015-04-19 18:02:00,6899,"Yes, we are down a bit from summer levels on Sturgeon Lake, at least it is coming up slowly. What is the right answer? Do you drop the water levels thinking that the melt and rain will cause a dump of water in the system or keep the levels higher and hope that a fast melt and dump of rain won't flood out homes and cause millions in damages! Levels were low this spring but I didn't hear of one faimily loosing everything they had to flooding because some idiot didn't let the water out soon enough!  It's easy to whine, try predicting the future!"
911002,John Bacon,2015-04-19 19:03:00,3277,"So, who let all the water out if it wasnt Parks Canada??  S.  There are two sides to the equasion.  Water inputs, and water outputs.  If the inputs are down, there may not be much they can do.  For Toronto, I don't recall having one single significant rainfall so far this spring.  We have had a few light showers, but nothing significant.  I also don't recall getting any snow in January.  Has the rest of Ontario had similar weather?  If Toronto is any indication, the water inputs from snow melt is well below average and the water inputs from spring rain has been virtually non-existant.  Lake Ontario levels are also way down from pervious springs.  I think the issue may be a lack on inputs rather than an excess of outputs."

Sturgeon is below average, but not below the historic low, Scugog is very close to average, Buckhorn is at an historic low, well below navigation range.

The lakes up here - the ones on the TW system - were dammed years ago to create a reservoir for the TW navigation system. TW sees that as the primary use of those lakes, all other uses are secondary. I don't see what they could have done about it. There just hasn't been water to hold back. The Gull system has been pretty much shutdown - all dams holding water - since the thaw started. It can all change with a few days of rain, as long as it happens before the leaves are out."
