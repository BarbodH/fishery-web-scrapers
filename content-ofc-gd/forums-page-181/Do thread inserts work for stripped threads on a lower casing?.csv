910839,muskymatt,2015-04-18 19:17:00,2608,Stripped the drain hole on my 9.9 prokicker last fall and was thinking of a thread insert. I assume I would have to drop the lower end to make sure no filings get in! Any suggestions or recommendations would be awesome Thanks

910841,ecmilley,2015-04-18 20:01:00,2163,First make sure its just not the drain plug. Inserts work fine put lots of helicoils in there usually stronger than original threads. drail oil  try to stuff a rag caked in grease behind hole drill slow then slowly remove rag most of debris will come with it

910860,aplumma,2015-04-18 21:50:00,6896,Make sure you put the heli coil in with an oil proof thread sealer it needs to be sealed since it is a set of threads. Check the thickness of what you are heli coiling it needs to be as thick as the coil is at least. in this case i would drill and tap it rather than helicoil it. Make sure you have the clearance for the tap to be threaded all of the way into the space behind it. Use a larger size plug. you can also tig weld the old hole and drill/tap another one next to it this will allow you to use the stock plug.   Art

910913,Bernie,2015-04-19 01:00:00,3190,Heli coils when properly installed are stronger than original threads. Don't be concerned about sealing the threads. The seal surface is after them.
910983,muskymatt,2015-04-19 17:47:00,2608,Great advice folks. Thanks I think I'll try tapping the hole first as the wall is not very thick.
