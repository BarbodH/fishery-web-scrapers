910012,lew,2015-04-14 11:02:00,12766,We had a corner jacuzzi in the main floor bathroom that was never used and  took up a bunch of space so it was time to remove it and put down new floor tiles & replace the toilet while we were at it.          Finished job and a huge difference with the tub gone.    Only casualty was my finger that got in the way of a hacksaw. LOL  
910013,ketchenany,2015-04-14 11:10:00,3229,A nice 5x7 of the finger hanging on the wall would look good.  Nice work Lew
910014,lew,2015-04-14 11:15:00,12766,A nice 5x7 of the finger hanging on the wall would look good.    I suggested that but the boss didn't agree LOL
910029,woodenboater,2015-04-14 12:42:00,2277,then hang it in the man cave
910092,mattybculp,2015-04-14 16:39:00,388,"I really like the look of that tile. Did you do it yourself ? If so it looks great, gives me some thought for when I redo our bathroom. I cant afford to have any finger mis-haps though as I'm already down to 9 1/2. I lost a battle with a wood splitter when I was young, so now I'm very conscious of where my hands are. When you cut a finger off you really start appreciating the remaining 9 and a bit lol. Great Job!"
910190,Ralph Field,2015-04-14 22:18:00,1018,Great looking reno !
910192,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-14 22:33:00,2582,Looks good Lew. Are those the vinyl tiles? If so I looked at some at Home Depot and was thinking of doing our upstairs bathroom in them. If you did the floor yourself and it is the vinyl ones could you let me know how they where to work with. I'm pretty handy and have tools....just never worked with the stuff before. Any feedback would be appreciated.  And I agree... the finger shot with the pretty blue stitches should be hanging somewhere
910196,misfish,2015-04-14 22:46:00,29133,"You took away a love bath. Dude. LOL  I was thinking I would of seen one of those spinning heart beds in it,s replacement.LOL  Nice reno SIR."
910198,lew,2015-04-14 22:52:00,12766,"Thanks guys  Steve, the tiles are porcelain and we're installed by a local company who has about the best reputation in the area. I do most reno's myself but when it comes to expensive flooring I like to leave it to the experts. Their coming back on Monday and installing hardwood in our bedroom."
910207,adempsey,2015-04-14 23:21:00,1498,"If I had a tub like that my family would probably be much larger.  Looks good, I really like that floor. I'd probably move the towel rack and put a linen cabinet there."
910211,lew,2015-04-14 23:31:00,12766,"If I had a tub like that my family would probably be much larger.  Looks good, I really like that floor. I'd probably move the towel rack and put a linen cabinet there.  There's already a linen closet in the room but it's out of range of the camera.  Just to the left of that towel rack is the shower."
910263,wormdunker,2015-04-15 09:35:00,1711,"Pix look great!  Oh, except the one with the cute blue stitches.  Did the doc let you choose that color?  LOL!"
910264,lew,2015-04-15 09:43:00,12766,"Nope, no choice on the color, if you don't like blue I spose they let you bleed LOL"
910319,Headhunter,2015-04-15 17:32:00,5703,The stitches are just a warm up Lew for the coming musky season! Good practice to do the drive dripping blood and gets the hands ready for the forth coming lip 'em season! LOL Nice job! HH
910323,lew,2015-04-15 17:52:00,12766,"Funny thing Joe, one of my worst cuts did come from a musky & that girl got me for 8 stitches LOL"
