910367,kickingfrog,2015-04-15 23:31:00,8333,Pulled the boat out of the garage and attached the hose. Fired right up just like it should. Come on melt!     
910371,misfish,2015-04-15 23:44:00,29133,"Looks like it still new Rob.  I fired, I mean, blew, mine up, and it,s ready to go as well."
910372,206,2015-04-15 23:46:00,563,"Had mine in the water last Sunday, it was way better than dragging out the hose"
910374,Mister G,2015-04-16 00:03:00,1429,I got mine running yesterday.....just turned the key once and dam it purred like it had been running all day. It wouldn't be long now until I will be taken massive amounts of crappie home to fillet
910378,AdamS,2015-04-16 00:33:00,161,Nice boat   and I'm jealous lol. Mines stored up north and I was told there's too much snow and mud where it is so they can't even get to it for at least another week... C'mon summertime!
910394,kickingfrog,2015-04-16 01:07:00,8333,"Had mine in the water last Sunday, it was way better than dragging out the hose  She's been absolutely perfect in the now 3 springs that I've had it after buying it from a member here. But I always assume it's not going to start and don't want to drag it, and dump it, in the lake to listen to that sound that no one wants to hear."
910398,Sinker,2015-04-16 01:20:00,8692,Mine fired up on the third pull tonight. Its usually the 5th pull after sitting all winter. She was itching to go as bad as I was  My trailer lights even worked LOL  S.
910404,livinisfishin,2015-04-16 01:36:00,661,That is  a sweet looking boat! Hopefully getting a 14' tinny wet this weekend.
910407,ccmtcanada,2015-04-16 02:13:00,7971,I got my boat out of my garage last weekend and started it up as well.  Need to install my new HDI 7 Elite and it'll be ready for the water!!
910409,porkpie,2015-04-16 02:43:00,2521,Now that IS epic!!!

Nothing worse then someone who didn't prep his rig for it's first spring fling before towing it and launching it and now holding up the launch because he has a dead battery or it wouldn't start. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ! ! ! ! !"
910423,BillM,2015-04-16 11:33:00,17367,"I hope this year they remove that giant rock on that launch ramp   I've nailed it a few times, lol."
910475,kickingfrog,2015-04-16 16:26:00,8333,Think its open?
910477,BillM,2015-04-16 16:39:00,17367,"Think its open?  I doubt it.  I might rip by there this weekend, I'll let you know."
910556,ketchenany,2015-04-16 22:01:00,3229,"If the boats come out, then it's safe to store the 'snowblower.'"
910568,huddy,2015-04-16 22:56:00,16,I want to hit the water too kicking frog. I met you and your bro at the township launch last summer when your son was learning to jump in. Pike opener then walleye. Hope you catch lots this year!!
910580,bigbuck,2015-04-16 23:53:00,2449,Mine is buried in the snow up at the cottage. I have to do a bit of work to get her running the way I want this year. I ran out of time last fall. 10 mins to do the cap and rotor along with the fuel filter and I will be good to go.
910583,Fisherman,2015-04-17 00:00:00,7201,"I hope this year they remove that giant rock on that launch ramp   I've nailed it a few times, lol. Which rock is that?"
