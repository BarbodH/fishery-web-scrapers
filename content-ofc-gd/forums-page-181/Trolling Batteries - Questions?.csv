I don't know much about them, so thought I would get thoughts/suggestions before I purchase.  I believe they are 24V, but will have to check to verify.  When purchasing, do I need to stay at 24V or should I go higher?  I am thinking of upgrading the trolling motor at some point - so not sure how big a role the batteries play in that.  Also interested in recommendations on where to purchase.  I tried my Costco on the weekend, but they did not have any Marine Batteries.  Thanks in advance for the help."
911158,BillM,2015-04-20 12:55:00,17367,"They're 12V, are they wired in series to provide 24v to a trolling motor?"
911160,Terry,2015-04-20 12:57:00,14456,They might just say deep cycle   And are most likely 12 volts each

911171,Roy,2015-04-20 13:30:00,13728,You can say that again.
911190,Sinker,2015-04-20 14:58:00,8692,"To get 24v, you would most likely have 2 12v batteries wired in series.  The costco in PTBO usually has a good supply of deep cycles, but I get mine from kawartha battery for cheaper, and they are really nice people to deal with. If you bring your boat with you, they will even install them free of charge. They are magnacharge batteries, and work great for me, and the price is right. I think I paid $130 for a 31 series deep cycle there the last time I was in.  S."
911201,hutch4113,2015-04-20 15:19:00,374,"Yes - now that I think about it, they are 2 * 12V in a series, to a 24V trolling motor.  I have 24V on the brain......"
911204,Sinker,2015-04-20 15:25:00,8692,"Yep, so you need 2 new 12V Deep cycle batteries. As big as you can fit in your storage area. They're probably DC27, or DC31 size battteries, but check and make sure......they could be DC24's.   S."
911266,chimpboy_to,2015-04-20 20:10:00,27,"I bought 2 of the Duracell deep cell batteries from Sail last year when they had a 15% off sale, worked really great for my 24v Terrova. If you do a search there are only a few battery manufacturers with a lot of different brand names."

The Costco in Markham had marine batteries in stock today.  I would expect the other stores to have them soon.  I have had good luck with Walmart batteries.  Buy two 12 volt batteries for now.  If you eventually get a 36 volt motor I would recommend three new batteries rather than mixing one new one with two old ones.  As other have mentioned, batteries are almost always 12 volts.  You can get 12, 24, or 36 volts by connecting them in series."
