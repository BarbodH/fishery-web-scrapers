910479,Christopheraaron,2015-04-16 17:01:00,3525,"So the last few days I've been walking around the neighbourhood enjoying the weather and practicing my turkey calling (diaphragm call). Well today I walked down past some houses on a quiet street that backed on to the upper Don Creek. I'm walking, yelping away and out of nowhere this gobbling just stops my heart. I freeze, get low to the ground and start calling back, within a few seconds I see a little blue head poking out of a hedgerow, again gobbling back to me. Soon enough we're having a nice conversation and I have a jake walking straight to me! I take out the cell and call my dad to grab the camera gear and get down as fast as he can, long story short I was going back and forth with this bird for maybe 40 minutes, him no more than 40 feet from me. Needless to say I suddenly have a lot more confidence in my calling, can't wait for opening day!      "
910484,grizzlybri,2015-04-16 17:22:00,565,"great pictures chris and well done on the calling.  it is always fun seeing how well, learning a new skill pays off"
910487,Beavertail,2015-04-16 17:31:00,331,Very cool and great pictures! But that looks more like a Tom than a Jake...he has a full fan and a decent length beard.
910491,Christopheraaron,2015-04-16 17:36:00,3525,"Could have been, I thought the same about the beard but the bird itself seemed a little scrappy."
910492,Sinker,2015-04-16 17:38:00,8692,Definitly a Tom. Look at the spurs on him! He's a stud!  Great photos!  I guess you got your hunting license then? Good stuff bud!! You know where I'll be once season opens!  S.
910494,Christopheraaron,2015-04-16 17:46:00,3525,"Well knowing that just makes me feel better again! I'll be doing my testing this weekend, ordered a bow and it should be here tomorrow."
910496,fishnsled,2015-04-16 17:53:00,3520,That is cool!  Great shots and good job on the call!
910498,highdrifter,2015-04-16 17:58:00,2534,Wow that's a beauty Tom too..  He'll probably make himself scarse come turkey season though..  cheers!
910500,aplumma,2015-04-16 18:08:00,6896,Good deal looks like you know how to talk turkey.   Art
910511,kickingfrog,2015-04-16 19:26:00,8333,These birds are rising up?  http://www.cp24.com/news/police-warn-of-turkey-on-the-loose-near-georgina-1.2330862
910515,solopaddler,2015-04-16 19:39:00,8605,That's pretty cool Chris. I'm trying to imagine what I'd think if I saw a young teen walking through my residential neighborhood making turkey gobbling noises LOL!
910516,misfish,2015-04-16 19:53:00,29133,"LOL Mike.  Watch out for the straight jacket guys Chris.  That was a cool read.  And yes, it,s  a Tom."
910551,manjo39,2015-04-16 21:42:00,354,"Good read.  The third picture, it looks like he's trying to show off and asking you to mate with him.  Just don't tell that to the straight jacket guys."
910579,FloatnFly,2015-04-16 23:52:00,1640,lots of nice feathers there for flies!
910589,Nipfisher,2015-04-17 01:04:00,2449,So ugly yet soooooo tasty.
910595,Joeytier,2015-04-17 01:42:00,3990," Nice work Chris, didn't realize you were getting into hunting"
910607,Acountdeleted,2015-04-17 06:07:00,2562,Very cool bud. Now you have a pet turkey. Should have lead him around town.
910619,doubleheader,2015-04-17 12:08:00,497,"That there is what we call a ""city turkey""."
