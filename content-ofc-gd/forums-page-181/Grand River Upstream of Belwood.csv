910320,netminder,2015-04-15 17:33:00,514,Just wondering if there's any info around about the Grand upstream of Belwood? All the internetting and Googling I can do has come up empty. The GRCA website has little info on anything even in the Grand Valley area. At first glance I almost thought it might be a decent speckled trout fishery. Any wisdom is appreciated.

The GRCA website has little info on anything even in the Grand Valley area. At first glance I almost thought it might be a decent speckled trout fishery. Any wisdom is appreciated. There are no top predators in this stretch of river and summer temps are a tiny bit to high for Brook Trout survival. You can find the odd dink smallmouth around. Many years ago @92 we had a plan in place and a commitment of eggs from the Bow River for stocking it and trying to create a resident rainbow trout fishery but whirling disease was running rampant in the rockies at that time so it ended up being nixed. We tried to find a suitable resident population here in Ontario but there is really only one fishery here and it was deemed to fragile to use for brood stock/egg collection.
