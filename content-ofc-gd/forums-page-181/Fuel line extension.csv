910165,cheaptackle,2015-04-14 20:26:00,849,Last time I did one I took it apart at the primer bulb & tank fitting then inserted a new length of hose using simple gear clamps.  Hose & clamps were bought at my local Home hardware and it took me almost a whole 1/2 hour to do the job - meaning quick and easy.  I wrapped a bit of electrical tape around the clamps afterwards just to cover up the bit that sticks out after torquing them up and checking for no leaks.  Michael

910361,sneak_e_pete,2015-04-15 22:16:00,540,Thank you!  Just did it and works great!
910362,Mister G,2015-04-15 22:45:00,1429,Just be careful as some of the newer outboards require a larger inside diameter hose then the older models called for.
910365,sneak_e_pete,2015-04-15 23:12:00,540,Thanks.  I used the same diameter.
