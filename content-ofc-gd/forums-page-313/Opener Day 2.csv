Everything's been picked over, the crowds are gone but a mess is left, the excitement just isn't the same as the day before. Everywhere I went there was bootprints and signs of guys fishing the day before. I did manage one pretty brown who had manged to escape from a heron a some point in his life and that was it    better shot of the heron wound      Hoping Whiteman's will come down in level a bit this week would love to get out and flyfish some bruiser browns."

782980,Musky or Specks,2013-04-29 00:27:00,2710,I figure Wednesday fish will be back on
