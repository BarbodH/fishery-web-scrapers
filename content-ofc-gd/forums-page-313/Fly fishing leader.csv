782081,bare foot wader,2013-04-24 22:44:00,1354,"if you're equally concerned about preserving your fly line tip, you can nail knot a piece of 20 lb mono to your fly line, and then a loop knot....that way you can you loop to loop your leaders and fly line  the perfection loop knot is quick and easy to learn, and from what I've seen is what is usually factory tied on tapered leaders"
782102,BillM,2013-04-25 00:10:00,17367, The BPS fly shop should have all kinds of leader with pre-made loops in them.  That's pretty much the only place I buy mine.
782175,torco,2013-04-25 12:41:00,656,"As the guys have said, the loop is key and if you don't have one using a perfection loop or something similar is great because loop to loop connections are quick and strong.  I like the factory tapered leaders because they are quick and if you take care of them really don't go through them that quickly. I like to use a triple surgeons knot to attach my tippet to my leader. Once I get to break off to my know I cut and redo my tippet."
782193,fish_finder,2013-04-25 14:13:00,370,"Just to keep things interesting....  I've been tossing flies a long long time.  My typical setup doesn't include a tapered leader.  I run a length of 6-12lb mono or fluoro depending the situation.  To that I add lengths of tippet as required.  This I run for nymphing and larger sized dries like stimulators, mice and hopper patterns.  Streamers, I'll usually run a length of sink tip from 4 to 12 feet depending on the water.  Attached to that, 15lb fluoro....4 feet of it, no more, but possibly less.  There's one situation I'll use a tapered leader.  The tiniest of dry flies.  sizes 18 and smaller definitely benefit from a tapered leader.  As others have mentioned, turning over tiny flies is tough..."
782196,landry,2013-04-25 14:40:00,1005,???Turning over bulky wind resistant flies is tough. Turning over small flies is easier. Adding a loop to the butt of a leader is not hard. I make a loop on the end of my fly line by soaking the last 2 inches of it in nail polish remover and then scraping off the plastic coating then fold over the core and wrap it with fly thread and bobbin and epoxy or crazy glue the wrap - creating a loop with the core. When nymphing I prefer to run thin 6-8 lb line for the majority of the leader length then step down to my tippet. This helps reduce drag and get flies deep faster.
782203,mirogak,2013-04-25 15:36:00,387,"Here is a podcast on leaders by Tom Rosenbauer.  Click on the first podcast named ""Even more on leaders"" and fast forward to about 30 minute mark in the podcast where he starts talking about leaders.  http://www.orvis.com/intro.aspx?subject=4047  Cheers, Miro"
782222,FishTracker,2013-04-25 16:55:00,47,"Like everyone is saying, it totally depends on your style.  When fly fishing, I personally always use a tapered leader, which varies in length (6-12ft.) depending on if I'm tossing heavier streamers (shorter leader) or the tiniest of dry flies or nymphs (longer leader for finicky fish).  A tapered leader essentially helps to transfer the energy from the heavy fly line down through to the tippet and ultimately helps to turn over the fly when casting.  That being said, my go-to leader/tippet length is 9ft for most occasions.  I use an albright knot tied to the end of the fly line that connects a heavy piece of mono of about 3 inches.  At the end of that thick mono is a perfection loop.  This perfection loop is used to connect the leader (also ending in a perfection loop) using a loop to loop connection.   For the leader itself, I personally use knotted leaders that step down from a heavier diameter mono, in varing lengths and diameters down to possibly a 0x, to which I tie on tippet material.  I connect the segments of mono using blood knots.  This takes some time to get used to but as you do it more and more, it gets faster and faster and I'd like to think it saves some cash.  The small spools of varying diameter mono are quite cheap and last a long time, since you're only taking small pieces out at a time.  As I change my flies and the tippet gets shorter and shorter, I simply just tie on a new piece of tippet and I'm good to go!  Works for me!  Hope this helps!"
782229,fish_finder,2013-04-25 17:19:00,370,Exactly.....
782243,torco,2013-04-25 18:35:00,656,So this should be clear as mud now  Basically there is no right or wrong way.
782248,davey buoy,2013-04-25 19:14:00,5505,"Thanks guys,for myself I'll try a 9' looped leader again,and hopefully not break it,and than tie a new tippet on when it gets to short. Maybe I missed something but when I tie my tippet through the loop,should it be tightened as one .Or should I make a loop to loop?.From what I'm reading a looped leader to a looped tippet can work?"
782249,davey buoy,2013-04-25 19:19:00,5505,Also guys I do have lots of mono I could use as a leader.What pound mono test would work in a 8/9 setup?.
782254,fish_finder,2013-04-25 19:30:00,370,"Loop to loop is fine, as is a surgeon knot (double or triple) as is a blood knot....  Here are a million knots for you to play with:  http://www.animatedknots.com/"
782256,fish_finder,2013-04-25 19:34:00,370,"The size of mono or fluoro that you use will be dependant on conditions.  If you're talking about line for a level leader that you'll be attaching tippet to,  try starting in the 8-12 lb range."
782257,FishTracker,2013-04-25 19:38:00,47,"My leaders start at about 20lb on the thick end down to about 4-6lb. for the tippet.  It really depends on the conditions though.  More important when tying a knotted tapered leader is to pay attention to and ensure that the line diametres are decreasing for each segment as you get closer to your tippet.  This will ensure better energy transfer from the fly line through to the fly.  Again, a personal preference."
782259,davey buoy,2013-04-25 19:42:00,5505,"Is that standard when you buy a leader?,meaning the taper being from 20lb-4/6 lb?"
782261,fish_finder,2013-04-25 19:50:00,370,"Again, there are countless types of leader out there.  Some with start with 20 or 50 lb and decrease in diameter until reaching the end of the leader.  These will range in very heavy sizes such as 0x down to much lighter, delicate sizes such as 8x and lighter."
782265,FishTracker,2013-04-25 20:04:00,47,"It really depends on the leader you buy.  They come in all lengths and strengths, depending on their purpose.  For knotless tapered leaders you'll see things like ""9ft. 4x"" on the label, meaning that it's 9 feet in length going down to (ending) with a 4x tippet with perhaps a 6lb. test rating for the tippet, which should be the weakest part of the entire line."
782270,davey buoy,2013-04-25 20:10:00,5505,"I think I'll have to refresh myself with what I have. This was spooled when I bought it,so I would think at least it was the basic standard?"
782315,misfish,2013-04-25 22:13:00,29133,Two more sleeps.LOL
782447,mirogak,2013-04-26 12:35:00,387,I am hitting it tomorrow eeeehaa
782571,misfish,2013-04-26 23:44:00,29133,"Great thread. Thanks for starting it Dave.  The one good thing about fly fishing,no worries about tieing roe.LOL"
782574,davey buoy,2013-04-26 23:58:00,5505,"Very interesting,always learning.A lot of great people here to help out.Far better than google! lol."
782004,davey buoy,2013-04-24 19:22:00,5505,"Now I broke my leader in half for arguments sake. My tippet as well as 1/2 of my leader. Don't ask why,or how lol. This was last fall. My set up is a 8/9 with floating line. I know the leader is tapered but when you break it should it be replaced.? I have enough of tippet material,but it's the leader I'm worried about?.Thanks guys."
782006,BillM,2013-04-24 19:25:00,17367,"Without the leader being the proper length or losing the taper, you'll have a hard time turning over flies..  Especially dries...  It needs replacing.  If you were tossing big streamers it really wouldn't matter."
782007,misfish,2013-04-24 19:32:00,29133,"My question is,why the need for a leader? I run a 9ft tippit from my main fly line."
782009,davey buoy,2013-04-24 19:37:00,5505,"Nice question Brian,I'm not apposed to buying a new leader,just the importance I guess."
782010,BillM,2013-04-24 19:40:00,17367, So you aren't making your leader shorter and shorter everytime you remove flies...
782012,davey buoy,2013-04-24 19:43:00,5505,"I think he replaces his tippet when needed,no leader."
782016,torco,2013-04-24 19:50:00,656,Hey the leader is needed to allow the fly to turnover when casting. But if you are throwing streamers and nymphing it is less important that it is tapered. It really depends on the situation.
782021,BillM,2013-04-24 20:03:00,17367, I can't imagine how he's turning over dries without a tapered leader.
782022,davey buoy,2013-04-24 20:05:00,5505,"So a leader is a must Bill?,river speaking from me ."
782023,BillM,2013-04-24 20:11:00,17367," I've always run a leader, doesn't matter what I'm doing to be honest.  It's not as important when your nymphing or tossing streamers like torco mentioned, but if you're trying to fish dries, it would almost be impossible..   The taper in the leader helps the fly turn over and land softly on the water.  Without it, the line would just coil up and the fly would drop pretty much straight down, lol.  Your presentation wouldn't be very natural at all..."
782032,misfish,2013-04-24 20:58:00,29133," Bill.with what I run,I can lay that fly just nice. I,m thinking the weight of the tippet,makes the difference. I,m running 2lb. You know where I,m fishing. 2 lb is max. If I did run a leader,on a 4-5 weight,what length would you recommend? Or any other fly guy."
782034,Christopheraaron,2013-04-24 21:08:00,3525,"it depends on the water for me, not the fish, on small creeks I just use a tippet like you, but on bigger water like the humber you want a leader."
782037,misfish,2013-04-24 21:10:00,29133, Why?
782038,bare foot wader,2013-04-24 21:12:00,1354,"all depends on your application, as mentioned, is more critical of a detail with dry fly presentations...you're setup is an 8/9, I'm gonna guess you're not dropping too many size 18's to finicky brown trout  heavier line has more spring to it, so it helps to turn over your leader/fly, but is not essential, it helps with low energy casts, like in dry fly fishing...but I find it is mostly important to help with a soft landing  you can still turn over nicely with a flat leader, ask ian james about it lol  for everything but dry fly fishing small stream trout, I don't bother with a knotless tapered leader (expensive)...i'm either running straight mono to a 2' tippet or if i get fancy 50/50 or 40/30/30 roughly"
782039,bare foot wader,2013-04-24 21:14:00,1354,"if you're really looking for a fancy leader, try using a furled leader, definitely buy a few before you attempt to make one"
782041,BillM,2013-04-24 21:17:00,17367," So at that place it really doesn't matter because you're barely even casting, lol.   I run 9ft leaders on my 4wt with another few feet of tippet if I'm tossing dries.    I don't dare bring my flyrod into that place man, a small UL setup works for me in there."
782050,misfish,2013-04-24 21:36:00,29133,  Thats to easy.LOL  Lets see what the weekend adventure brings.  Im stoked to get out. The Notty has layed a beat down on me this spring.
782056,BillM,2013-04-24 21:47:00,17367,The Notty is blown to all hell..  I'm going to hit Lake O on Sunday..  I'll fish residents after the craziness is over.  No big rush.
782057,davey buoy,2013-04-24 21:47:00,5505,"Now I buy a new 9' leader for my 8/9 set up. So I should only break my tippet off with a snag or fish or whatever. I understand the tippet can be as little as 3' from the leader. The question now is if I broke 2' of my tippet because of a snag for instance. Should I just tie another 2' of tippet to the remainder of tippet. If that is correct,how many times can you add knots to your original tippet?. From what I understand you don't want to touch the leader?,correct?"
782058,BillM,2013-04-24 21:58:00,17367," You should never be breaking your leader instead of your tippet..  And yeah if you snap your tippet and there isn't much left, re-tie a new piece onto your leader.   The leader isn't entirely tapered.  There's probably a 2-3ft section on a 9ft leader that's not tapered.  So you've got some leeway when having to re-tie your tippet without getting into the tapered section."
782059,bare foot wader,2013-04-24 21:58:00,1354,"the point of the tippet is to preserve the leader...typically it'll be 2-3' and retie when you break off, gets too short, frayed, etc  I would not tie more tippet on top of tippet....every knot is another potential failure point and reduces the line strength...I'd either fish the short tippet or tie new  I wouldn't worry about buying expensive tippet material or leaders, if you're new to casting you will get wind knots and if you don't check/remove them promtply your leader will either snap during casting or on a fish"
782060,landry,2013-04-24 21:58:00,1005,Save your money. Attach a 3' section of 20 lb mono to the flatline. Use a triple surgeons knot to attach 3' of 12 lb approx. then add 3' of 8 lb. then add your tippet. Or something similar.
782063,davey buoy,2013-04-24 22:06:00,5505,"landry,could you resay that it layman terms. lol. From start to finish please . Thanks."
782069,wallacio,2013-04-24 22:20:00,475,"He's describing how to make a tapered leader by stepping down heavier line to lighter line.   Personally, I'm happy to spend the few bucks on knotless tapered leaders (especially that come with a pre-tied loop on the end to attach directly to the end of your fly line)...no fiddling around with tying 3 knots or more per leader."
782072,davey buoy,2013-04-24 22:26:00,5505,"If I recall last year,BPS didn't carry the leader with a loop at the end. I did ask. I bought the 9' leader and used a nail knot to tie to the fly line if I remember correctly."
