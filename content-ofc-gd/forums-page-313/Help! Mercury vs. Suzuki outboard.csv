778159,Rizzo,2013-04-07 21:03:00,4754,Thanks guys for all the info...you have given me the confidence to go with the Suzuki!
778160,SlowPoke,2013-04-07 21:35:00,2984,Roger was asking about four stroke Merc and Suzuki. I wasn't about to cloud the issue with the pro's and con's of an etec when that's not available to him.
778161,irishfield,2013-04-07 21:38:00,26272, I just thought you were an educated consumer! LOL
778162,SlowPoke,2013-04-07 21:41:00,2984,Johnson is no more. Evinrude E-TEC 2-stroke and Evinrude Portable 4-strokes (3.5-15 hp made by Tohatsu)
778163,SlowPoke,2013-04-07 21:43:00,2984,Blah blah blah.... LOL  
778209,ohhenrygsr,2013-04-08 01:15:00,947,"My opinion is to go with a company that has more dealers that will service the brand of outboard after the sale. The more dealers that service an outboard the quicker you will be back on the water. Plus mechanics will call each other from dealer to dealer to help out with issues. I've seen first hands, when our mechanics are stumped they will call Mercury direct for troubleshooting ideas. Great network!"
778213,chris.brock,2013-04-08 01:54:00,4053," I think the goal should be to buy an outboard that will keep you running, and on the water, not how close the dealership to service you quick and get you back on the water.  It was a long time ago, and things have likely changed, but I worked at a marina in the late 80's and the mercs were always in for repairs, the OMC stuff was always out on the lake  While window shopping at the cottage show today, a princecraft dealer said merc has bought alot of the boat manufacturers, that's why alot of boats come with mercs, princecraft included, I don't know if this is true, I hope not  since my 1981 enticer, I buy yamaha when I can (right now, 2 outboards, 2 older sleds and a scooter, all yami)"
778214,Rizzo,2013-04-08 01:55:00,4754,slowpoke that boat is MAMMOTH! I'm definitely calling you on the windy days.
778233,SlowPoke,2013-04-08 03:12:00,2984,"LOL!! Don't wait for the windy days, you're welcome anytime!!!"
778235,Mike the Pike,2013-04-08 03:21:00,3421,"I would go for the Mercury ....I had a 55 Suzuki on my first boat although it served me well I was not impressed with service.  My first summer with the boat I ripped up the prop and had to replace the prop shaft it took 3 weeks to get the part back order from Japan.  My dealer dropped them a few yrs ago he says most parts were not stocked in North America.He got fed up and decided to stick with Honda,Yamaha and Mercury.  was talking to him at the boat show it seems its the same old story always a hassle to get parts in .They are often back order.  Now I know Suzuki makes an excellent product but if you ding the motor its going to be a long wait.  May as well get the Mercury !!!"
778240,pikehunter,2013-04-08 09:27:00,1659,"Unfortunate answer to this is yes, it is true.  I know a dealer who carried Lowe, they had to pick up Merc in order to continue to sell Lowe boats when they were bought out. He does not and did not want to represent Merc so therefore they are no longer a Lowe dealer.  Your options are Mercury or Suzuki? Choose the one with the most readily available parts and repair shops. Then also consider resale value and ease of selling it down the road. Do some research on the value of each at 5 to 10 years of age right now and you will get an idea as to which is the better buy.  Who is it that says they're "" #1 on the water."""
778243,Radnine,2013-04-08 10:25:00,1538, Did carry Alumacraft. They are getting out of them (can't remember why Clarence said). Jim
778255,jedimaster,2013-04-08 12:47:00,3472,"A merc will be cheaper to fix and get parts for down the road. Like say if you smack up the lower unit, chew up the prop etc... Merc parts are a dime a dozen, Yamaha(which I own and love btw) and even more so Suzuki and Honda, the parts are harder to come by.  Just do a search for used lower units and props for each motor, and call the dealer and ask how much plugs, wires, coils and a water pump kit are. Those are the most common repair items on an outboard."
778307,bow slayer,2013-04-08 19:18:00,1074,"""I say if you want a motor that has ready available parts and service go mercury ,you will need them....if you want a reliable outboard and want to spend your time on the water rather the repair shop go yama,suzuki or honda.""  direct quote from a good friend of mine who has been marine mech. for nearly 30 years....mercury mech. at that...he owns a yamaha......"
778308,jedimaster,2013-04-08 19:23:00,3472,"Somethings need to be repaired or replaced.... Plugs, wires, filters and some are prone to oops repairs props, lowerunits, prop hubs etc..."
778426,Tony68,2013-04-09 11:14:00,31,"Hi everyone, Suzuki, learn to due the basic maintenance yourself and you'll have no problems. I have also bought a manual for every boat motor I've owned"
778430,Fish Farmer,2013-04-09 12:10:00,2234,"Your right. I talked to Clarence the other day and he said Alumacraft said they had to be a Alumacraft dealer only. Bay City sells Lund boats also, so good by Alumacraft. Princecraft junk also said they had to be sold with a Merc, and Bay City dropped them. I think Bay City may go to G3. I know Rizzo said Merc or Suzuki, but Bay City said when they sell a Yamaha, they never see a customer come back. I own 2 Honda's and can't complain. My next motor ? I don't know what to do now that Bay City won't be selling Alumacraft, I hate to think I may have to go with the over rated Lund. Alumacraft has the best spec's on the market, except if your going to life long boats like Stanley or Harborcraft Kingfisher, but it's going to be double price."
782503,ohhenrygsr,2013-04-26 18:08:00,947,Ya... times change and technology change ain't really a bad manufacture out there if you stick with quality names
777914,Rizzo,2013-04-06 13:26:00,4754,Just about to buy a new boat...and then got the option of Mercury 75 4 stroke or Suzuki 70 4 stroke. Any feedback greatly appreciated!
777917,BillM,2013-04-06 13:35:00,17367,No Yamaha option?
777918,ecmilley,2013-04-06 13:35:00,2163,"merc, nothing wrong with  the zuke whatsoever but if there is ever a problem with a near bulletproof merc 4 stroke there a merc dealer on every lake and corner of cottage country not so much with a suzuki"
777924,Rizzo,2013-04-06 13:50:00,4754,rumour has it there is a suzuki shop in cambridge (I'm in Kitchener). Apparently the zuki is more than 100 pounds lighter than the merc which I assume is a good thing on a 16 foot boat
777926,lew,2013-04-06 13:53:00,12766,"My 90 Merc purred like a kitten for 9 years Roger, and has been just as good for the new owner for the last 4 years. I'd assume the new 70's would be just as good and as Ernie said, there's plenty of Merc dealers around if you ever need anything.  Never had any experience with Suzuki's but I don't think I've ever heard anything negative about them either.  But.... if you can get whatever you want, I'd go with Yamaha."
777930,captpierre,2013-04-06 13:56:00,2521, Hey Lew.  Wasn't your Merc really a Yammy in disguise?  peter
777931,lew,2013-04-06 14:02:00,12766," Yeah, some of them were made by Yamaha Peter, but I'm not sure which ones. But whether it says Yammy or Merc, their both reliable motors."
777934,captpierre,2013-04-06 14:06:00,2521," In 2007 when I wanted to pull the trigger, a 115  4 str Merc would have been my choice.  Yammy made their heads and they were bulletproof.  However, in 2007, Merc started making their own heads.  I went Yammy instead.  Has been great so far.  I know you love your 150 Yammy as well."
777935,Rizzo,2013-04-06 14:29:00,4754,...nobody offered the yami
777938,Roy,2013-04-06 14:58:00,13728,That's probably because they want you as a service customer  as well as a purchase customer.
777940,Tybo,2013-04-06 15:01:00,1373,"Roger,They are both very reliable engines.If you plan on doing the maintenance,All your going to need a marina for is parts. I'm partial to merc.But at the right price I buy a Suk."
777944,mr blizzard,2013-04-06 15:30:00,1589,"I have to agree with all that was said, both are good, maybe a lighter engine is good for your purpose, but just for what my comments are worth our 90 Merc has been flawless, doesn't skip a beat, troll for hours, no fouling, etc  And as was mentioned there are alot of  Merc dealers around which may get u up and running faster in the event of a mishap.  The only problem we had was a magnet cracked inside the electric motor for the tilt trim, replaced under warranty, no issues since.  Whatever u buy enjoy."
777946,spincast,2013-04-06 16:28:00,3279,you have to wonder what they took out to reduce 100lbs of motor on a 70? I'm not saying heavier is better - but you may want to look at where that difference is?
777947,landry,2013-04-06 16:31:00,1005,"I had a 70 hp Suzuki. Crazy quiet. Ran flawlessly for 8 years with no repairs needed. I love those motors. I now have an optimax and like it. It did have a 3000$ repair once under warranty. CAS marine is a Suzuki dealer. Their repair prices are very high IMO. I now deal with bay city marine and the r very fair and carry Yamaha. He told me the yamahas  r incredibly reliable, insinuating they fix them less than mercs. My next motor will likely be a Yamaha and then second place is a Suzuki. Landry"
777948,Rizzo,2013-04-06 16:32:00,4754,"my bad...I think the suzuki is only 50 pounds lighter than the Merc., not 100 lbs"
777949,landry,2013-04-06 16:32:00,1005,They also carry alumacraft at bay city in Hamilton btw. Great boats to fish out of and well built.
777950,landry,2013-04-06 16:32:00,1005,"I had a 70 hp Suzuki. Crazy quiet. Ran flawlessly for 8 years with no repairs needed. I love those motors. I now have an optimax and like it.

777951,fishboy,2013-04-06 16:52:00,550,"I've owned a 2002 Suzuki DF40 for 8 years now and have found it incredibly reliable, and the routine maintenance is easy.  The issue of dealerships hasn't been one for me as Northland Marine in Carnarvon near Minden is a Suzuki spot.  The other advantage is that Suzuki made 4 strokes painted and labelled as Johnson back in '02, so I've been able to get oil filters etc from Bombardier shops."
778106,wallyboss,2013-04-07 17:07:00,1095,I have a 75 Merc 4stroke on a 16ft Princecraft and it isn't too heavyboat sits perfectly in the water.
778112,Big Cliff,2013-04-07 17:27:00,6899,Had a 55 Suzuki for years excellent motor! Only problem I had was finding a dealer close to me. If I did want to get it serviced I had to haul it over to Minden. Bought a new boat three years ago and opted to go with a Merc because of lots of local service. I haven't needed it but it is available if I do. In my opinion both are excellent motors but I do like not being tied down if and when I do need service on it.
778123,SlowPoke,2013-04-07 18:25:00,2984,"C.A.S Marine is in Ayr, about 10-15 minutes from Cambridge towards London. Starcraft, Merc, Suzuki dealer. I dealt with them last year with some boat warranty and no issues other than the service manager(?) being a little forgetful. Suzuki is not a bad motor but parts and dealers were hard to find and that ticked off a lot of people. A lot has changed in the past 7-10 years, parts and service shouldn't be much of a problem now. The 4 strokes have always been good, 2 strokes were hard on gas, all were reliable and good performers. Older Merc 4 strokes were Yamaha built but now I think they're manufactured by Tohatsu.  I think my first choice would be Yamaha, then Suzuki with Merc & Honda running neck and neck for third choice."
778130,captpierre,2013-04-07 18:48:00,2521, no E-Tec in there?
778133,Guest ----,2013-04-07 18:58:00,0,"I believe the newer Suzuki, Johnson, Evinrude are basically all the same. They are all built by Bombardier. My buddy has a 140 Johnson 4 stroke and it is so quiet the only way I can tell it is running is the water pump. No issues in 5 years. I read some where that the smaller Mercs are now being built in China. I will be ditching my merc for a bombardier made motor on my next rig. Dundas marine at Clappison's Corners also services them."
778156,FishAbout,2013-04-07 20:31:00,106,Suzuki makes there own stuff. All the johnson four strokes are suzuki.  I have df140 with over 1000 hrs and still runs great. Not much you need to buy to service them. Oil filter and oils. I buy fram oil filters for mine. Just went to the fram website and looked up the right filter. I use merc oil and gear oil.
778157,Guest ----,2013-04-07 20:53:00,0, Ah...thanks for clearing that up.
