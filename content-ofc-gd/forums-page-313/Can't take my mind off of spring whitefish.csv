782157,Freshtrax,2013-04-25 06:06:00,2215,"Even though trout opener is right here, I can't take my mind off of simcoe spring whitefish.  Problem is I have never been out for them.. I have a few questions  and while there is tons of info online about spring laker tactics there's not much for whitefish.  Where should I start my hunt?  Shallow reefs with Steep drops to deep water? Rocky  points of 55 ft that drops to 100 ft on either side? ( one comes to mind).  What are the crazy buggers  doing this time of year? Feeding? On the biology websites it says ther in the rivers?  Is this one of those cases where simcoe fish have different patterns?  Are they still schooled up like in the winter?  And do they remain like that all year round?  Are they more or less aggressive in the spring?   Thanks for reading, feel free to om if ya wish"

782216,captpierre,2013-04-25 16:30:00,2521,Will be interesting this spring.  Many say there was a huge die-off under the ice.  Rumours of thousands of fish on the bottom of the lake or floating under the ice.  Not sure if fact or fiction.
782291,Freshtrax,2013-04-25 20:43:00,2215,Fiction.
782370,BillM,2013-04-26 00:16:00,17367,"Yeah, I don't quite agree with the whole whitefish die off, etc..   Guys found them, just not in the normal places.   I know lots of fish were caught really shallow this year, think perch like depths, lol."
782414,Sinker,2013-04-26 04:04:00,8692,I don't know what's up with the missing whities.   Make sure you have a good anchor with lots of rope.  S.
782422,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-26 06:14:00,8243,If what I hear about all the ice still on the lakes above TO you might not need a boat.
782439,BillM,2013-04-26 12:06:00,17367," There's no ice up here, lol."
