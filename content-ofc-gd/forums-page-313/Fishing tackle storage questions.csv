782518,kickingfrog,2013-04-26 19:42:00,8333,"Well the clan is on the move to a new house. The house is a similar size but the basement is finished so I have to be more judicious in my rod/tackle storage.  Two considerations other than in the house are:  The cold room, it is huge but I am hesitant to put the rods (and tackle) in there because the humidity isn't controlled.  The garage is insulated but not heated/cooled.  Thoughts on using either of these?  Augers and such I'm not worried about, but the cork handles, fishing reels, tackle bags and soft plastics are the main potential issues."
782527,SirCranksalot,2013-04-26 20:30:00,3291,Tell the 'clan' that if your gear 'goes bad' you'll have to buy new stuff. That will concentrate their minds to come up with a viable solution!
782529,John Bacon,2013-04-26 20:44:00,3277,I wouldn't think that humidity or temperature should be a problem... think of the conditions that we fish in.
782535,fishindevil,2013-04-26 21:30:00,6254,They would probly be better in the shed instead of a damp cold room ?? I keep rods and reels in my basement and it's barely heated but it's dry and that I think is important more than anything or you could run a dehumidifier in there ??
782536,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-26 21:31:00,8243,"Not an issue. Mine is all stored in an unheated, un insulated shed for 17 years, hot and humid in summer and have never had an issue with anything. No worries, loosen off the drag on reels and store away, The only thing I would say is to keep it away from direct sunlight if there is a window and keep any fluids i.e. bait sprays from freezing. Make sure you haven't put anything away wet."
782539,cheaptackle,2013-04-26 21:41:00,849,Not sure how handy you are but I don't think it would be a whole lotta work to convert the cold room (if you've a mind to do so) - give it some thought - wish I had a whole room just for tackle & gear!  Michael
782582,Garnet,2013-04-27 00:36:00,2056,I would store rods and reels around lawn mowers and gas cans ever.
782600,porkpie,2013-04-27 03:09:00,2521,I store all my rods and reels up in the roof of my garage.  Never an issue!
782602,irishfield,2013-04-27 03:31:00,26272,Rob... I leave all my rods in the hangar.. some in the boat.. some lying about. The only ones that have ever grown mould on the cork where the ones in the floor storage locker and I'd forgot to leave the access door cracked open for air flow. Garage will be just fine...
782637,kickingfrog,2013-04-27 13:22:00,8333,Well that puts my mind at ease a bit. I might try the cold room first. It's 40ft by 4ft so it is not much use other then storing drinks and such.
782669,Moosebunk,2013-04-27 19:47:00,3970,"Agreed too with the garage guys Rob.  In the house is great if you have the space because during the off season you can sort tackle, clean reels, etc. without having to drag stuff in from outside.  But that's really a non-issue come a sunny spring weekend.  Congrats on the move."
782671,Basskicker,2013-04-27 19:55:00,421,"I have all my fishing stuff, except for the electronics out in the garage......everything seems fine."
782699,Wolf 3,2013-04-27 21:59:00,134,What? No master-bedroom closet? I guess the garage would be the next best place...Congrats on the new house.
782703,kickingfrog,2013-04-27 22:44:00,8333," Big walk-in, I might be able to use a sliver of it for my clothes and that's only 'cause my wife can't stand to see me naked."
