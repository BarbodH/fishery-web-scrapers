What happened last year with early runs, low and clear water, too many people, rudeness on the river all seemed to be long forgotten and when I pulled into my normal parking spot for opener at 5:30 am, I was very surprised to be completely alone.

You can't catch anything with a worm and certainly can't make millions off of worms!!!! I worked with a guy that had a worm farm, being the citiot that I am I asked him, Mike how do you get all the worms in the barn at night?  Good going my friend as they say the early bird catches the..........................................."
