781790,Basskicker,2013-04-23 22:19:00,421,"To say its been a hard winter would be an understatement, we have had between 120-135cm of snow in APRIL.....yes that's not a typo.  We had 30-40 last Friday and another 30+ today.  There is still over 36"" of ice under my hut ( hoping to remove the 1st week of MAY)......people who have lived here for over 40 years have never seen this much snow fall in April.  I can probably just walk onto my garage roof and there is another 14' aluminum boat and trailer with a canoe strapped to the top of boat behind my bass boat  :clapping: , there also a utility trailer in there somwehere    The snow in my backyard has drifted so much that it is almost touching the eavestrough     But I got to go snowmobiling again today and didn't have to fight any traffic to get to work!!! Life is awesome in the north and I don't regret moving up here.  Cheers  Jason "

781817,solopaddler,2013-04-23 23:56:00,8605,We changed our Nakina fly in date from the 11th to the 18th so I've been watching the long range forecasts up there like a hawk.  14 day weather forecast for Geraldton looks great starting on Saturday. Warm daytime temps and well above zero at night along with wind and rain.  You apparantly live in a small corner of the world that God doesn't like very much LOL!

782482,fishnsled,2013-04-26 16:11:00,3520,On the bright side there are no bugs to deal with Jason.     Hopefully the melt doesn't cause any bad flooding for you.
782485,wkimwes,2013-04-26 16:28:00,76,"Wow that is insane, that is a lot of snow."
