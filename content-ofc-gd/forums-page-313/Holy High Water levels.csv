781423,woodenboater,2013-04-22 12:37:00,2277,The final drop at Burleigh has some rebar from what I've been told by people who've paddled it. Some nice waves upstream of the last drop though.
781442,jedimaster,2013-04-22 15:25:00,3472,Its going to get even worse in Bancroft. For those that don't know the Elephant and Baptiste are a flooded section of the York river held back by a dam. The York flows through Bancroft. Today they released a statement saying they are being forced to remove another log from the dam. This is said that it will raise the York another 2-6 inches or something like that making things even worse. The reason is there are fears that the dam might break so they are trying to relieve some pressure. If the dam breaks there are fear that Bancroft (essentially a bowl) will be under water within an hour as much of Elephant and Baptiste will drain into the town. At least this is what I heard. Crossing my fingers for those in Bancroft.
781444,jedimaster,2013-04-22 15:29:00,3472,"Here is a shot that is very telling. You can see the bank of the York river where the pole is. Normally there is a fairly big drop down the bank, 4-5 feet if I recall to where the water level normally sits there.  [/url]"
781451,mirogak,2013-04-22 16:02:00,387,"Just got word from the owner of the cottage in Bancroft which I had rented for this upcoming weekend, his basement is under 3 feet of water."
781460,SirCranksalot,2013-04-22 16:28:00,3291," aaah, but the Liquor Store is still open, so not everything is lost!!!"
781466,GBW,2013-04-22 16:34:00,8460,I was at my folks place yesterday and The Burnt River might as well be a lake right now.  The 7' tall or so out houses are under water right up to the top of roof peak now.  those are far from the rivers edge too.  
781482,Headhunter,2013-04-22 18:11:00,5703,"Gives a whole new meaning to the term ""floater"". HH"
781869,manitoubass2,2013-04-24 02:31:00,11391,"total opposite here, super low water levels"
781911,jedimaster,2013-04-24 12:19:00,3472,So now we know who is to blame for pulling the drain plug...
781912,Rich,2013-04-24 12:30:00,3927,I bet my grandfather's cottage on the burnt river is a boat house right now.
782459,manjo39,2013-04-26 13:30:00,354," Hi Cliff, has the water level on Sturgeon changed since the weekend?"
782612,Big Cliff,2013-04-27 09:08:00,6899,"As of last night it had dropped about 6-8"" from it's highest level. Lots of floating debris so becareful if you are going out in a boat."
781037,Big Cliff,2013-04-20 15:25:00,6899,"Sturgeon Lake is easily 2' above normal right now. The point over at the marina is under water right now, I haven't seen that in the 12 years we've been living here.  "
781041,Raf,2013-04-20 15:51:00,3495,its crazy folks out on huron/gbay have no water at their docks / water intake pipes and the inland lakes are overflowing.
781043,The Urban Fisherman,2013-04-20 15:55:00,2050,"Same out this way - smaller lakes are high, ponds and creeks have all blown their banks and longpoint bay is lower then I've ever seen it!"
781060,SirCranksalot,2013-04-20 16:48:00,3291, Give it time. Water runs downhill!
781077,Rich,2013-04-20 18:22:00,3927,Great lakes' aquifers are being bottled up for you to conveniently buy as nestle pure life. Inland lakes are safe..... For now.
781093,Sinker,2013-04-20 19:05:00,8692,The problems happen when all that water gets to the great lakes. Then its gone forever!  S.

781186,NAW,2013-04-21 00:44:00,4022,Talking to some folks that where driving from out Ottawa way toward my place.  And they had a few detours because of closed roads. All due to flooding.

781235,Nipfisher,2013-04-21 05:02:00,2449,How did you get your truck at that angle? LOL
781272,dewar,2013-04-21 14:01:00,5,"ahhh its just a lil bit of water, we need it anyway, just hope it doesn't flow to far south"
781284,lew,2013-04-21 14:51:00,12766,"Here's a few pics I took at Burliegh Falls earlier this morning.  The water is high, fast & furious              And sadly, the garbage pigs need to ruin every beautiful spot they can.    "
781288,4x4bassin,2013-04-21 15:23:00,1025,Just heard a lot of roads in Algonquin Park are washed out including Opeongo Road as well most secondary roads in South Algonquin are either flooded or washed out ! That is a crazy situation up there .
781289,jedimaster,2013-04-21 15:30:00,3472,Bancroft has declared a state of emergency.
781290,ccmtcanada,2013-04-21 15:36:00,7971,Unbelievable!!!
781310,jedimaster,2013-04-21 18:47:00,3472,Talked to my cousin the pictures are crazy. The york river is right up to the river bank in town. The water level looks at least 10 feet high in the river. Water is flooding the streets. Its crazy.
781312,Beans,2013-04-21 18:55:00,3339, Looks like great water for the kayakers Lew ...Too bad about the garbage though...
781315,lew,2013-04-21 19:39:00,12766," 50 odd years ago we used to go down those rapids on rubber tubes Norm, don't think I'd want to try that anymore"
781318,Rich,2013-04-21 19:51:00,3927,"My aunt lives in Bala and has been putting up similar looking pics on her FB. She is actually stranded at her house on the moon river right now because the road out washed away, and i doubt she'd try boating into town right now!"
781338,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-04-21 22:12:00,535,"I have to go up to Bancroft tomorrow, too...."
781372,Rod Caster,2013-04-22 00:39:00,5784,"huntsville is completely flooded as well. I guess we fared well in North Bay, even with the huge sinkhole on Hwy 11, all things considered."
781379,manjo39,2013-04-22 00:46:00,354, It got higher today.  The Kawartha Lakes website stated that it will keep rising into next week.
781412,Big Cliff,2013-04-22 09:13:00,6899,"It did go up more yesterday, perhaps another 3-4"". Got my board walk fixed with my son, my neighbour, and I working on it. All sorts of stuff floating around out there yesterday from huge logs to small islands."
781418,lew,2013-04-22 11:30:00,12766,"The water levels don't appear to be as high...yet...as a couple years back.  This is a picture I took of the locks at Yonges Point 2 or 3 years ago and you can see the water is right up to the top of the cement wall where the boats tie up waiting to pass thru.    And this is the same lock yesterday, the water is probably a foot higher than normal but still alot lower then before.      And this is the dam at Yonges Point yesterday.    All this massive amount of water heading south thru the Kawarthas has to funnel thru the narrow Ottonabee River from Lakefield down to Rice Lake and it's a real balancing act for those in charge. If they let too much water thru at once they flood the homes on the river, and if they don't let enough thru, they flood the area north."
