782218,captpierre,2013-04-25 16:43:00,2521,Maybe a silly question but I need to take a queen bedset to the cottage on my Safari's roofrack.  What would be the best arrangement?  Boxspring below or on top? Or does it matter.  1.5 hr trip.  I want to make sure it is secure.  Lots of good memories on this bed.   don't want to lose it  peter
782223,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-25 16:57:00,10439,Box spring on bottom and make sure you have straps front to back as well as side to side. The boxspring will keep the mattress from being pushed down and the straps will keep it from being pushed up.  Don't want this to happen.

782267,porkpie,2013-04-25 20:06:00,2521,Make sure you put on hand out the window to hold it down....... LOL

782606,SlowPoke,2013-04-27 04:33:00,2984,"Box spring on top!!! Bag them if possible... mattress shops will usually give you a couple bags. Lay the mattress on the roof, box on top. Tape or rope the two together, then strap or rope them to the rack. Side to side AND front to back. Take your time driving and check your load OFTEN  "
