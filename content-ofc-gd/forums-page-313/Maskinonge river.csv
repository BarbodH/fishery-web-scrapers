Anybody know the reason for the lack of fish? There seemed to be tons of excellent fish habitat... Where did the fish go?"
782846,Terry,2013-04-28 13:18:00,14456,sure you don't mean the holland river
782857,mr blizzard,2013-04-28 13:55:00,1589,Thats what I was thinking as well
782908,Gallie,2013-04-28 19:11:00,1215,What were you fishing for? I fish the holland sometimes
782913,mattyk,2013-04-28 19:53:00,2110,"In the past I have caught many perch, crappie, pike, carp and catfish there."
782918,Shloim,2013-04-28 20:35:00,515,"Maybe it was the holland river, but I thought I was starting at Makinonge park. Apparently it connects with the holland in Bradford. So b ause I didn't go downstream all the way I think I was in the more polluted  part. There were othe people there equally unsuccessful"
