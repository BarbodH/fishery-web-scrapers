782413,Joey,2013-04-26 03:56:00,9122,Was on a bird/photography site and someone found this today on shore.  Apparently it is a Grebe that's eyes were bigger than it's stomach.

782420,adolson,2013-04-26 04:59:00,783,I find this pic funnier than I probably should.
782430,Roy,2013-04-26 09:20:00,13728,You know how fast the walleye was moving when he hit the bird?

782892,Dave Bailey,2013-04-28 16:04:00,1641,"Red-necked grebe, winter plumage. They're not the only ones who make mistakes, I've heard a credible witness who found a dead Great Blue heron with a stick lodged in its throat after mistaking it for a fish. We don't have the insult 'bird brain' for nothing."
