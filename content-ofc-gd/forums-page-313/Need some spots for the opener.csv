Any other suggestions that won't have me breaking the bank, or the reel, would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your time."

I picked up a 5"" Stanton for around $120 shipped and a 4"" JW Young Purist 2030 for $110 shipped a few years back, both from the UK.  Have to be nicer to fish than an Aventa????  Burt"
