(it actually made more ice since our last trip)  How is the easiest way of removing it?  It is about 2KM from the landing, and another 5km to the plowed road.  I am hoping that the snow/slush will run into the lake when the lake pops and then the snow will be melted on the road so we will be able to drive out and tow it back to the landing.  The last 50+cm of snow really screwed things up and created this mess.  I will let the pictures do the talking.  This is the 1st time in 7 years that my buddy has ever had to use the extension    This is where the auger got stuck just before breaking through!!!   This is my hut ........  It's sitting on 12"" wooden  blocks under the axles, have 10"" skis incorporated into the tires still to be put on the axles SOMEHOW!!!    This is my buddy's hut......everything was floating when we opened the door!!!!     We have 2 skidoos, 2 atv (winchs) and argo (winch) and my new to me japanese mini truck (winch)......   We are hoping that everything melts soon and we can siimply drive out with our trucks and tow them back to the landing......there is still the motherload of ice for this time of year!!!  Any ideas?  This is all new to me....never had to deal with this much snow/ice/slush before  Cheers Jason    "

782928,Gallie,2013-04-28 21:14:00,1215,We have had to rip a couple out of the ice. One we saved one came home in seven or eight pieces. My advice would be to start chipping. Bring some friends!
