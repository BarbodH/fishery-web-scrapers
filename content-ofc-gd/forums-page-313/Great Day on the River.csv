Sunday Started early at about 530am   after a slow morning which resulted in a 10lb silver bullet lost after about a minute long battle had a great shore lunch with some friends    After about an hour and full belly, back down to the river, the afternoon was just as slow as the morning, but managed my first of the day and landed this beauty on a bead head hares ear    about 2 hours later, landed my 2nd of the day on the same fly     headed back in the am, hopefully the weather isn't too horrible "
