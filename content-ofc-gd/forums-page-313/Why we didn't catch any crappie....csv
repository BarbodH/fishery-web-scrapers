782909,Tdel,2013-04-28 19:23:00,393,That sounds logical to me.

783031,Moosebunk,2013-04-29 02:16:00,3970,"Ahhhh Beans.  Take up muskie fishing come opener then, cause they'll have fed up fat on all that free drowned meat."

783057,Big Cliff,2013-04-29 09:50:00,6899,"Went out to one of my old favorites yesterday with Pikeslayer and his son-in-law, counted 32 boats in the little bay we like to fish. There wasn't a lot of catching going on and of the ones that were being caught most of them were small. A couple of hours fishing and we managed to bring home 10 that were big enough for the table but the biggest one we caught was only about 11"".  It was still a nice day to be out on the water and spend some time with an old friend."

Hey Bunk...The only time I try trolling for muskie is opening day (1st Sat in June) and a couple of years I ended up with good size pickeral above the slot size...I have caught some muskie fishing for bass with a tube/finesse minnow under a float...One year I caught a muskie while fishing for carp with corn on my hair rig...
