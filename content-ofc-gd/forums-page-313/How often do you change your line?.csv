783141,BillM,2013-04-29 18:00:00,17367,"If you haven't already, just reverse it..  You'll easily get another 2-3 years out of it."

783149,aplumma,2013-04-29 18:33:00,6896,Watch the line for the first casting amount as you despool it for nicks and cuts. Remove as needed and then reverse it back on the reel. Then reel it onto another one of your empty reels. I add that amount to the backing and it comes out perfectly spooled and you won't break off the fish of a lifetime if you get into the back of the spool.   Art

783157,Garnet,2013-04-29 19:35:00,2056,And you can reel it from 1 spinning reel to the other or baitcaster. No Memory.
783183,Angler management,2013-04-29 20:40:00,280,"Really depends on the line, some of the new braids fade really fast, and some deteriorate shortly after their smooth-feel coating wears off. Main one im thinking of is ""power pro slick 8"". Really like the feel of the line, but it doesnt last me nearly as long as regular power pro."
