It was a lot of fun and caught many fish. Shad fight really good on light tackle and are acrobatic and jump and give several good runs. It is a catch and release fishery only. I was able to catch American, Hickory and Gizzard shad, along with carp.       "

782656,mike rousseau,2013-04-27 17:09:00,4661,I actually don't think that's a regular carp....  It looks like a crucian...  I think...   ...

782863,Raf,2013-04-28 14:10:00,3495,"Conowingo Dam..brings back memories.  Always wondered what swam above and below the dam. I crossed it many times and spent some time around there and PA State Park when I was working down in Edgewood/Bel Air, MD.  Nice part of the world as you head up from there to PA."
783025,bassassin,2013-04-29 02:08:00,152,was in Philly this week that is an impressive waterbody for sure!
783039,The Urban Fisherman,2013-04-29 02:36:00,2050,Awesome stuff!  That almost looks like a bigmouth buffalo - much more of rare catch when compared to carp!  Either way good stuff!
783229,StarTzar,2013-04-29 22:26:00,51,Nice
783230,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 22:27:00,93,Nice fish
