780244,ohhenrygsr,2013-04-17 01:35:00,947,Hey Everyone just an update. The launch downtown Orillia and Tudhope park is still frozen. The city is waiting to put the docks in.  I booted over to Blue Beacon Marina and they are fixing the ramp in time for the perch fest. The ramp across from Blue Beacon is usual as I launched by boat lol. It is open on Simcoe side up to the no wake zone as large chunks of slush/ice is moving it towards the Narrows. I boated over to couch side and was able to boat right up to couch pt buoys. The canal by Gill st is completely open if anyone is interested in tossing a line  Picture from 4-15-2013  
780245,ohhenrygsr,2013-04-17 01:36:00,947,Let me know if you need any pictures from around Orillia area
780286,Radnine,2013-04-17 11:28:00,1538, We need more pictures of Mariko Izumi! Jim
780299,Fish Farmer,2013-04-17 12:46:00,2234,Is that launch across from Blue Beacon ( Old Harris boat rental ) open to the public Henry and what are they charging?
780792,kickingfrog,2013-04-19 18:13:00,8333,"Local newspaper article:  http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2013/04/19/orillia-perch-festival-starts-saturday     ORILLIA - Perch in lakes Couchiching and Simcoe are ready to start biting, said Doug Bunker, organizer of the 32nd annual Orillia Perch Festival. “With the open water now, the oxygen levels in the lake go up and a couple degrees’ increase starts (the perch) into feeding, which is why they’re so popular and easy to catch this time of year,” Bunker said Wednesday. “They’re hungry and there’s lots of them.” There is still ice on Lake Couchiching and one piece at the mouth of the Atherley Narrows. “Very warm weather with rain (today) in the forecast will probably do a lot of damage to that ice,” Bunker said. “Every year, we get a little nervous, but it disappears.” The perch are hiding right under the ice, he said. “They use it to hide under. It’s almost like structure to them,” Bunker said. “Once it goes, they scatter for a couple of days and then they start coming in in schools.” The 32nd annual Orillia Perch Festival begins Saturday and runs until May 11. Wednesday morning, Bunker challenged 100 anglers to go out and catch perch to be tagged. Seventy-three tagged perch will be swimming in lakes Couchiching and Simcoe for this year’s festival. There will be 70 perch tagged at $500, a $1,000 Barrie Speedway-sponsored perch and two $3,200 Casino Rama tagged perch. “They have eluded anglers for a couple years, so I think they’re due to be caught,” Bunker said of the casino’s tags. “If somebody catches them, that will certainly help support their fishing habit.” Each day participants fish, they are entered into five prize draws. “The incentive is to fish more, which the sponsors like,” Bunker said. The top raffle prize is a Lund 1650 fishing-boat package. “We always have a good response to that because it’s every fisherman’s dream,” Bunker said. The opening ceremonies take place Friday at 7 p.m. at ODAS Park. OPP Kids Day will take place May 4 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Tudhope Park. “There’s some great prizes to win,” Bunker said. Closing ceremonies wrap up the festival May 11 at 7 p.m. at ODAS Park. It costs adults $20 to register and for children younger than 16, it’s $5."
