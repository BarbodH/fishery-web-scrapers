Smaller lakes that are sheltered may not open by the weekend, but would be worth checking. Road access could be dicey, although the flooding is mostly limited to the Gull river system right up into Haliburton forest."
782449,snagmaster,2013-04-26 12:44:00,250,Sounds awesome.....I know moore lake is open. Im planning on taking the boat up to do some flatlining for lakers in the minden area....Does anyone know which lakes (launches) are open......Also which laes are flooded or merked up.  Thanks.
782544,fishboy,2013-04-26 22:01:00,550,be careful on the water as there will likely be way more floating hazards than usual in the spring with the crazy high water levels...lots of stuff  washed & floated into the lakes
782547,fishindevil,2013-04-26 22:29:00,6254,Yes and the water was apparently flowing over the minden dam lots of roads are washed out so you better check before you go !!!! Mountain lake and horseshoe lake are super high and flooding the Dwight area and Dorset area have sustained lots of flooding as well be carefull the lakes have debris docks and logs and stuff all over them just saying !!!!! Know before you go Haliburton is still under a state of emergency
782619,singingdog,2013-04-27 10:26:00,1047,"Haliburton is not, and never has been under a state of emergency. The flooding is limited to a small area of Minden, and is largely on the Gull River system. Lakes that are not on that system show very little effect of the high water."
782682,fishboy,2013-04-27 20:50:00,550,pretty much all the Gull watershed lakes are at record high levels upstream of Minden...the Parks Canada site has maps that link to all the dam sites and give current water level readings at the dams compared to historic low and high levels-many have gone right off the top of the scale or are above the historic high water recordings http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/on/trentsevern/visit/ne-wl/trent_e.asp
