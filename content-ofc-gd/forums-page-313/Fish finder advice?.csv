782532,Shloim,2013-04-26 21:17:00,515,How well or poorly do the les expensive units work? I'm new to fishing and have never owned one...
782552,Rizzo,2013-04-26 22:43:00,4754,"how do you define ""less expensive"" There are units out there for just over 100...but my Elite 5 for around 500 I would consider a lower cost unit. What kind of pricing do you mean?"
782557,spincast,2013-04-26 22:58:00,3279,"and right now you can get an Elite 5 for a song http://www.basspro.com/Lowrance-Elite5x-Fishfinder/product/10215775/  if you are in the market for a FF, you cant go wrong with this unit at this price."
782564,Tayzak15,2013-04-26 23:24:00,318,"Yep just picked up an elite 5/gps combo, honestly seems like the best value fishfinder for non professionals."
782590,beagle dad,2013-04-27 01:17:00,224,"fish finder??????????? maybe for big waters cheaper is fine  what you want is a unit to show weed edges and depth once  YOU  find the fish work similar areas of depth and weed structure,bottom structure"
782604,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-27 04:23:00,8243,"You can't beat that Elite 5 for that price of all you need is sonar. I think I paid $700.00 for a tiny Eagle Ultra black and white portable in 94'. But it still works if you can believe it !!!!!! Not much else is still working from 1994, including me."
782611,Rich,2013-04-27 08:51:00,3927,"What do you want it to do?  If you mean how well does it work as in, shows depth, temperature and structure, then you simply cant go wrong. They all work. From units under $100 to $500 to $1300 dsi's. I run a modest priced humminbird 210sx (modest for me being $160 lol) and it's just fine for marking depth, structure and fish."
782613,Terry,2013-04-27 09:09:00,14456,you get what you pay for
