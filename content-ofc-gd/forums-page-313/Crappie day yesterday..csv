After an hour we found the fish, bluegills n crappie. They were all in an area about the size of my driveway... if you casted even 10 feet out of that spot, nothing... Overall we caught probably 50 crappies (all good sized) and numerous bluegills. I kept 8 for dinner tonight. This fish at the top I think was the biggest."
