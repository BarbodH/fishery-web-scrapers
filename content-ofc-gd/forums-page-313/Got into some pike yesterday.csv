I caught two 28"" pike that could have been twins, while my buddy got a nice 31"" and a 16"", also he caught a 21"" walleye.  All were caught on Rapala's, half while casting and half trolling. The pike were all nice thick fish, even the little one had shoulders, and were delicious.  Water temps were low to mid 50's and the level was at least a foot and a half higher than normal."
