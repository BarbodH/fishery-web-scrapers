I need to get rid of the fuel that my father-in-law has had in the tank for a few years, and a bonfire is not an option. Any suggestions?  Roy suggested using it, in small quantities, in my car. That was my original idea, but I don't have containers to hold it in and I don't want to buy another tank."

782976,danc,2013-04-29 00:15:00,4677,"First, let me say that I think that the old gas going bad thing is just a myth drilled into the heads of consumers by companys making solutions to sell their products. I can't count how many times I've used one and two year old gas without a problem. My off season is 8 months long up here and never have I had a bad fuel issue without using stabilizer. Not once. But, if you must get rid of it, I like Roys idea. Just throw it into your vehicles gas tank. Don't waste it."

783070,Dave Bailey,2013-04-29 12:37:00,1641,"Some of you may remember my question last year about the motor itself. It was running a little weird, starts fine, but RPM drops when I twist the throttle all the way, and it runs better with the choke out. I need to get it apart and give it a good cleaning, check the filter, etc. What I may do is just take it for a good long run and use up all the gas, and then do the maintenance. Could be the gas, could be the system needs a cleanout, could be the filter needs replacing, could be could be could be... I'm a complete newbie at this so things might involve a lot of swearing. May need to pick up a maintenance manual from somewhere."
