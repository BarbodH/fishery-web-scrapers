Would be interesting to see any pics from all the local lakes (Scugog/Pigeon/Rice) etc.  Chomping at the bit...   Is there a site that hosts this information? Water level information is great but ""Pictures are worth...""  Thanks."
782651,ccmtcanada,2013-04-27 16:33:00,7971,You won't find any ice on those lakes you mentioned...  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/modis.php?region=o&page=2&template=sub&image=a1.13111.1829.LakeOntario.143.250m.jpg  Just be careful of floating debris!
