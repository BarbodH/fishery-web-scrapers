One person reports in their report  says they thought someone fell out of bed upstairs. Last night I heard a boom/bang twice. Once sounded like my daughter fell out of bed, the other time I was standing in the kitchen and the boom was above my head. Could it be the roof trusses contracting, or the plywood on the roof, or something like that?  My house is 120 ft from the shore Lake Scugog and I am used to booms from expanding lake ice, which come through the ground, both last night felt like they were on or in the roof.  Thoughts?
