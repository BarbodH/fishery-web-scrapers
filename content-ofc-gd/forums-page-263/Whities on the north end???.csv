827896,NAW,2014-01-01 15:38:00,4022,"I usually drive all the way down the Inisfill to chase white fish.  But I'd really like to try some on the north end.  That would cut my drive in half.  Anyone have any luck on the north end for White fish in the past?  Or could possibly give me a starting point?..  I was thinking hawkstone area, if I can find an access point.  I may head out after lunch to look for access and check ice.  If anyone  cares to join..."
827898,davey buoy,2014-01-01 15:50:00,5505,Not at the 9th you won't.Closed till spring.Hope this is not the start of more closures on the way?
827924,misfish,2014-01-01 18:14:00,29133,"They are putting in a PROPER DOCK..  The bite was real slow this morning. Chasers,but no takers. Lots of guys out,and lots of guys off by 11AM. I got off for the hockey game.  Sure was nice to out Jan.1st.on the big water."
827934,BillM,2014-01-01 19:05:00,17367,"Nice Brian, what kind of ice thickness is out there?"
827936,misfish,2014-01-01 19:09:00,29133,We were on 4 black with 3 white. Just enough snow fell to bank up the hub to keep it toasty warm.
827962,BillM,2014-01-01 20:06:00,17367,Can't complain about 4inches of good black ice on Jan 1st!
827999,NAW,2014-01-01 21:29:00,4022,Nice.  Thanks for the info Bri
828070,miller,2014-01-02 03:13:00,223,Had a hard time keeping them on managed to land 2 lakers and a whitefish out of 9 fish hooked.
828088,Lunkerhunter,2014-01-02 12:26:00,455,I landed 4 but be careful out there still. I found a lot of ice with only 2 inches out in the middle of kemp bay. A few spots the spud went through in one shot
828094,NAW,2014-01-02 13:18:00,4022,Thanks guys!  It's good to here people are tying in to some whities!!!  I'm getting excited now.
828137,Steel28,2014-01-02 19:37:00,160,I landed 4 but be careful out there still. I found a lot of ice with only 2 inches out in the middle of kemp bay. A few spots the spud went through in one shot  Any sleds or quads are out? I was hoping to bring sled this weekend to BBP.
828140,NAW,2014-01-02 20:02:00,4022,"Hopefully not, if there's still spots with 2""!  That being said...  My buddy from Alcona said he saw a quad out past snake island earlier this week."
828141,davey buoy,2014-01-02 20:08:00,5505,"I think it varies Nick,heard from a fellow out in Kempenfelt and found many 2"" spots.I'm sure with the last couple cold days and tomorrow,there should be no worries.This was just the day before new years."
828143,kickingfrog,2014-01-02 20:32:00,8333,I might take my son out Friday. He's off school and has been asking to go. I'll likely stick to the perch areas to keep him happy. I tell myself there's always a chance for a pike to keep me happy.
828178,Lunkerhunter,2014-01-03 00:19:00,455,Yes quads and yes sleds but it is very sketchy. Where there was more snow the ice did not build the same. I would not recommend taking the quad just yet
828180,Steel28,2014-01-03 00:25:00,160,"Yes quads and yes sleds but it is very sketchy. Where there was more snow the ice did not build the same. I would not recommend taking the quad just yet thanks, hopefully more ice will get built for the weekend. Taking sled anyway."
828197,NAW,2014-01-03 01:25:00,4022,I got tomorrow off.  So I'll be heading out in the COLD tomorrow morning.  Anyone else going out?
828203,Freshtrax,2014-01-03 02:20:00,2215,Too cold for me but I should be out somewhere sat/sun
828209,Fisherman,2014-01-03 02:34:00,7201,"I can just hear the car tomorrow morning..no no no no no...rrrrrrr..fizzle.   I got the makings for some cinnamon rolls, home made, real yeast dough and it's gonna stink up the home some fierce."
828228,NAW,2014-01-03 04:05:00,4022,Ahhh.  Come on guys.  I look forward to the cold days.  Challenging conditions make it more rewarding when you ice a fat whitie!
828229,NAW,2014-01-03 04:09:00,4022,"thanks, hopefully more ice will get built for the weekend. Taking sled anyway. I've heard from a few people now that there's spots with 2"".  Both current reports from the past few days.  I'll be spudding my way out tomorrow.  Have you been out on Simcoe yet this year?"
828312,NAW,2014-01-03 20:04:00,4022,"Just got in from a cold day on the ice.  Ice is decent.  3.5"" of black.  In some places it has 6"" of frozen slush on top..  In others I has 4"" of slush/water with a thin crust of frozen slush.  Marked a few.  Would have got skunked if not for a herring..."
828315,Rob,2014-01-03 20:10:00,467,Where did you end up fishing Nick?  Rob C
828321,NAW,2014-01-03 20:24:00,4022,Just a little north of where you mentioned.  Marked some lakers.  No schools of whitefish though.  Is there Perch along the shore there?
