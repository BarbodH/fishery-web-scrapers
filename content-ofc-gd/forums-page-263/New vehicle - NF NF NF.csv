True-blood Jeepers are not big fans of the new looks and comfy interior...but for the price, there is nothing like it in its class.             "
827299,Hooked,2013-12-30 01:47:00,891,Personally I think they look awesome!  Congrats.  I was driving beside new Grand Cherokee SRT8 the other day and fell in love with it. Nice ride.
827316,gino,2013-12-30 02:43:00,400,"Congratulations on your new ride, I like the color....but you won't take this one on beat up trails, right?"
827317,Rod Caster,2013-12-30 02:47:00,5784,wellllllll.......   She'll have custom pinstriping by the spring!
827320,woodenboater,2013-12-30 02:56:00,2277,I miss the boxy looks of my old Cherokee and am waiting for them to realize they should drop a diesel power plant into the Patriot. It's that or I get the MB 250 Blue Tec cuz the Grand Cherokee is just stupid money.
827329,BillM,2013-12-30 03:01:00,17367,"I just can't get over the looks, and that rear wheel up in the air pic doesn't speak very good for offroading, lol!"
827330,irishfield,2013-12-30 03:01:00,26272,I guess the hut can go on the roof.....

It's that or I get the MB 250 Blue Tec cuz the Grand Cherokee is just stupid money.  They are puting the Blue Tec diesel in the Ram 1500 next year...can't see why they wouldn't eventually offer it in the Jeep with a 5 or 6 speed manual.  I just can't get over the looks, and that rear wheel up in the air pic doesn't speak very good for offroading, lol! In person, the Trailhawk looks way better than any photo.. not a fan of the lesser models with lower bumpers. I wish they would have used a more traditional headlight design, but I didn't buy it strictly for the looks. The interior and fit/finish is really something else for it's class.  It's no Wrangler, that's for sure... but the locking rear and other off-road controls will beat nearly every other non-jeep SUV or even truck out there.    I guess the hut can go on the roof..... hahaha. The open bed is the only thing I miss of the Mazda. I asked the salesman if it came with a snowmobile-compatible roof rack."

827373,Rod Caster,2013-12-30 13:17:00,5784,"  It's a 3.2L. For the very minimal gas savings and the almost 100hp drop in power (trailhawks are heavier), the I4 didn't seem like a great option. It was my first choice, but I instead decided to pay cash for the $1,200 upgraded V6.  I've never been a chrysler fan, but this Jeep stands out and so do the discounts!   REALLY ??? This is very interesting. My wife is open to the idea of a pick up as well... Yup, that sealed my decision NOT to buy a 1500 this year."
827375,Rustic-Fisher,2013-12-30 13:47:00,826,"Nice rig,  I was just checking those out at our dealer .  Diesel is apparently headed for the wrangler for 2015. If that's the case, I'll definitely be grabbing a New Rubicon."
827396,Raf,2013-12-30 15:07:00,3495,"the fact that it is fwd before the awd kicks in, kinda turns me off.  but the looks have grown on me.  can you 'lock' it in full time 4wd/AWD?  it has 4LO right??"
827400,Rod Caster,2013-12-30 15:39:00,5784,"Yes you can lock in 4lo with rear locking diff as well. Full traction off as well. It's a capable system...better than most trucks unless they come with lockers.  Not sure if it default's to FWD..?? I know that some models are FWD only, but I would think that the Trailhawk is RWD bias...good question, let me do some burnouts and I'll let ya know."
827613,spincast,2013-12-31 13:36:00,3279,"Congrats on the new ride, sweet looking ride. Cant wait for your first report accessing the back lakes, cant help but wonder if it will look like this though  ..  If I remember, you also had some fun on the ice last year?"
827618,Rod Caster,2013-12-31 14:00:00,5784,"hahaha  Funny thing is: a jeep cherokee is what towed me out of that hole.  She'll see lots of backlakes, and yup, can't wait to taker her on Nipissing. Shouldn't be long."
