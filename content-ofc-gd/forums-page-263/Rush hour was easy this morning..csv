My physiotherapist actually asked me to come over by sled, she thought it would be really cool as nobody had done it before, seeing that i can see the surgery from my house…..had to oblige!     she gave me pretty much the all clear as far as the elbow goes and no more appointments…..just some stretches, time to drill some holes me thinks"

That second make shift ploughed road got me good 3 years ago, hit it at around 45mph on the XLT….holy crappola….I landed perfect luckily. I walked back and measured from the take off point to where i landed…..more than twenty paces!!!  Its particularly bad on the overcast days when you cannot see contours, even the hardened tracks through old slush can be an issue if you hit them unexpectedly and at speed."
