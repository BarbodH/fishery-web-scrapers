827056,misfish,2013-12-28 17:58:00,29133,"Drove around yesterday just looking at the regular stomping grounds,and came accross a spot that I thought would be worth trying. Ya got to love it when you find new spots.  4 hours of non stop action. Perch and lots of herring. I even caught a herring that was 6 inches. Both Terry and I had to take a double take,as we both thought it was a smelt. MAN ARE THEY EVER ON THE REBOUND. There has to be atleast 4-5 even 6 year classes now since they closed the season on them.  The ice machine was always full of fish. Not sure what was up with Terrys. Think it,s broke.  Oh he got his too.    I kept just enough for tonights dinner. They will go well with fried taters and cold busch beans.      Back out again in the morning. It,s nice when you dont have to drive a couple of hours,and can just for a short time,and be home to watch the juniors."

827062,manitoubass2,2013-12-28 18:13:00,11391,Awesome!  Im jealous. I went out yesterday and struck out big time. Only 3 walleye all day lol. The fishfinder works awesome but when tour not catching it makes it even more heartbreaking as tou watch all those fish hahaha
827063,misfish,2013-12-28 18:22:00,29133,"When I would lift the bait out of the crowd,some would follow. When I seen yellow or red,I would stop the lift and wham. Fish on. If I left it dead stick,they wouldnt touch it. Im still in awe with this machine. I know I keep saying that,but if you dont have one,it,s worth the purchase.."
827065,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-28 18:23:00,2582,The filleting job looks a little rough...what did you use...a butter knive  You can't beat fresh perch IMHO. Well done Brian.

The fish finder puts way more fish on the ice...and stops you from wasting time on dead water. I curse all the wasted years I was too cheap to spring for one."
827069,misfish,2013-12-28 18:28:00,29133,The filleting job looks a little rough...what did you use...a butter knive  This is the second fresh feed in two years Steve. Out of practice and the Rapala needs a sharpening. Bugger off.LMAO
827070,Terry,2013-12-28 18:30:00,14456,good fun on the ice today  they did not have the part so my skidoo is down for another week

827078,irishfield,2013-12-28 18:48:00,26272,"Your sled is dead... that's not good... not good at all !  Great day out guys.. sure beats what I've been doing.. removing 22"" of wet snow from the enclosed trailer roof and airplane wings and pushing snow banks back with the tractor."
827089,Big Cliff,2013-12-28 20:30:00,6899,Sounds like a steller day of fishing to me!
827093,Marko,2013-12-28 20:55:00,854,"   Hey Misfish how goes it. Juniors lost so maybe you should have stayed on the ice I am in the market for a very same fish finder,  4x Elite Ice Machine. How are you liking yours ? Does it track the jighead well past 100 feet? Thanks again Marko"
827094,misfish,2013-12-28 20:58:00,29133,"Ya they lost. Good heart finish.  I caught what I need so,Im good.  I,ll get back to you on the depth thing on the first of the new year."
827106,Joey,2013-12-28 21:55:00,9122,"Sounds like fun B.  Paul and I tried our hand out from Gilford today.  Only 2 keepers and the rest were dinks.  We may join yous tomorrow  and, I LOVE my Aqua View."
827108,misfish,2013-12-28 22:02:00,29133,"Well that feed is down the hatch.  It was like candy.  Fried up the first batch,started the second. When that was done,the first batch had disappeared.  Thank god for the back up shrimp and spring rolls for the mrs,s."

827126,Christopheraaron,2013-12-28 23:59:00,3525,"Well done! We went to virginia today and the place is dead in terms of jumbos. I think most people got a couple each but they were few and far apart, think we'll be out for the first?"
827134,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-29 00:29:00,8243,"You should have told him, "" no fish for you, one year ""......."
