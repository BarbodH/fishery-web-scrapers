826647,davew3,2013-12-25 18:11:00,430,"Good day, Merry Christmas.   I have been looking at the C.T. flyer and see they are putting on a Keep A Float suit on sale.  My question is,  does anyone know just how warm these are?  I know my Mustang jacket keeps the wind out and I stay warm,  but it is getting to small for me,  or me to big for it.   So I am looking for a complete suit.  Any info would be appreciated.  Regards"
826693,Woodsman,2013-12-26 00:30:00,1286,Go in and try one on. A couple years ago I did the same & could not find one that fit me comfortably. For me I found the Helly Hansen fit better. Could be the opposite for you.
826857,davew3,2013-12-27 16:21:00,430,Well   went and bought the suit.   Can't wait to try it out on the BOQ.  Now I have a size large Mustang float jacket for sale.   Will post it in classified as soon as I take some pictures and figure out what it is worth.  Have a safe New Years eve everyone.
826879,Steve,2013-12-27 19:23:00,2075,"just as a heads up, that suit is not DOT approved and cannot be used as a pfd on a boat.  just a heads up."
826969,Woodsman,2013-12-28 02:43:00,1286,"just as a heads up, that suit is not DOT approved and cannot be used as a pfd on a boat.  just a heads up. DOT is not the approving agency in Canada. Transport Canada is. Here is the description of the suit from CT Web site. Check the tag inside the suit to confirm."
826970,irishfield,2013-12-28 02:45:00,26272,"I didn't spend a lot of time on it in the store on the 23rd.. but all I saw was ""your pdf only works if you wear it"" in the lettering.  That said.. who really cares as long as it floats you as advertised. Generally there are regular life jackets / pdf's in the boat to be legal in a spot check anyhow."
826973,Woodsman,2013-12-28 02:50:00,1286,Generally there are regular life jackets / pdf's in the boat to be legal in a spot check anyhow.  They only count if they fit you the way your dressed. Not many PFD's will fit over my 2XL suit.
826994,Roy,2013-12-28 03:31:00,13728,"From the Government of Canada website:  Only the devices marked with one of the following are approved for use in Canada: There is an exception which reads:  Only these devices are approved with the following exception for foreign nationals: ""A person who ordinarily resides in a country other than Canada, where the person brings aboard the pleasure craft a wearable personal flotation device or lifejacket of appropriate size that the person has brought into Canada for the person's use while in Canada and that conforms to the laws of that country."""
