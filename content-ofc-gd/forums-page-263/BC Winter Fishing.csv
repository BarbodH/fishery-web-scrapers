828285,jedimaster,2014-01-03 17:00:00,3472,Just wondering if anyone has been in BC in the winter I am thinking about taking a short trip and getting a guide for a day or two of fishing in BC at end of Jan. Anyone have any comments? Anyone wanna go? haha

828298,jedimaster,2014-01-03 18:21:00,3472,Found this... Looks like Steelhead is the only thing I would be interested in. Perhaps I will have to wait til October... Anyway Steelhead from BC would be nice. http://www.tofinofishing.com/fishing_species_seasons.php
828300,jedimaster,2014-01-03 18:51:00,3472,I did see a snowmobile tour that looks interesting.
828302,Christopheraaron,2014-01-03 18:55:00,3525,I just assumed we were talking steelhead
828303,Christopheraaron,2014-01-03 18:55:00,3525,There's lots of bull trout too.
828305,bare foot wader,2014-01-03 19:04:00,1354,"are you set on tofino/the island?.....island fishing tends to pick up right about now, dec was a very slow month  in the lower mainland you have a good range of rivers you can cover on your own without needing a guide (not many/any guides drift these rivers - mostly walk and wade, unspoken rule kind of).....assuming your a proficient steelheader, no point in paying for walk and wade guide IMO, with some google research you can find plenty of access points, backroad mapbook, etc ...you'd be renting a vehicle?  the island would be worth a guide, river access is a bit tighter on some of the smaller rivers, and especially for the pleasure of fishing from a drift boat  PM me once you get your dates figured out, can point you in the right direction  you say you're only interested in steelhead, but maybe give sturgeon a go"
828306,bare foot wader,2014-01-03 19:07:00,1354,"in addition to steelhead, like Christopher mentioned, bull trout, cutthroat and rainbows bite good all winter"
828308,jedimaster,2014-01-03 19:45:00,3472,"It just looked like form the season chart that only steelhead was available. I am open to most anything though. I haven't done much steelheading in Ontario. mostly a boat fisherman here that's why I was thinking a guide might be good. I mean I have done some river fishing, but mostly for speck and inland rainbows. I am looking to go for the last week/weekend of January. I am flexible on the exact timing though. So any advise on timing, possible guides, locations I can try on my own etc.. is great help."
828317,bare foot wader,2014-01-03 20:18:00,1354,"gotcha, a guide would likely be smart move then and waaayyy cheaper than a large capital ""investment"" to gear up for river fishing ha  bent rods are highly regarded  or call pacific angler, and see who they can hook you up with"
828382,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-04 01:44:00,10439,"I have friends in the Prince George area. Lots of good rainbow, burbot, laker, brook trout fishing through the ice up there."
