827328,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-30 03:01:00,2582,We have a Fire Extinguisher at home that we got because we have a wood stove. It is rechargeable. I have never had this done but it is time to do so.  Can anyone here point me in the right direction to get it recharged and give me a heads up on the cost?  Thanks for any help you can offer.

827353,irishfield,2013-12-30 04:21:00,26272,Gauge in the green.. turn it upside down and hit it a few times with a rubber mallet.

827364,fishindevil,2013-12-30 09:18:00,6254,"Like irishfield says but , sometimes the powder inside does go hard and regardless it's probly time to take it to the pros at my work the come once a year and do about 25 of them it needs to be checked and recharged for sure !!!! Better to be safe than sorry as it doesn't cost much at all"
827365,Terry,2013-12-30 10:55:00,14456,"if it's more then 6 years old then it has to be Hydrostatically tested too , so it is as cheap to buy a new one"
827381,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-30 14:43:00,2582,Sounds like I'm just as far ahead to buy a new one. Which is what I figured. Truth be told I never gave it any thought before and just figured it was good to go as long as it had never been used. It has been hanging up in the laundry room for 24years  Next question. How do I dispose of it?

How do I dispose of it? Take it to your local fire hall, they might even be able to use it for training purposes or something!"
