Admittedly some ice was sketchy so we plunked holes beside the docks at a couple of marinas to engage our quarry. We had lots of perch to keep us busy. Many in the 12""+ size. This morning the son hit the jackpot with a 27"" brown and a nice little bow to go along with the regular fare of perch. All but the bow going back to fight another day. It's been a great fishing week for the son and I."
