826918,misfish,2013-12-27 21:50:00,29133,  Me bad.
826920,aplumma,2013-12-27 22:22:00,6896,Come on down some day and I will show you my brass kahunas........ she keeps them on the fireplace mantle.     Art
826921,misfish,2013-12-27 22:24:00,29133,LMAO
827927,misfish,2014-01-01 18:21:00,29133,"Well,I was warned and found out today.  Fished 100 fow and I had a hard time marking/finding my jig. Terry tried everything he knows,and I trust if it could be done,he would of..  I will be putting a call into Lowrance  in the morning and asking if this is an issue. If it is,I will be asking for an upgrade. Very disappointed today after enjoying it so much.  I could mark fish no problem. Some chasers this morning,but no hook up.  "
827947,Rustic-Fisher,2014-01-01 19:39:00,826,"Yep, fought with my x67 ice machine for years in the deep stuff. Gave up, and went with a eagle fishmark 320, far from ""elite "" but marks at every depth and has been a great unit for teasing lakers into smashing baits. I've had a few models over the years but prefer the old eagle. Curious to hear what they say.. Today's weather was brutal on the old eagle lol."
827950,manitoubass2,2014-01-01 19:43:00,11391,"Its funny you could mark fish but not a bait???  It doesnt concern me too much, deepest my unit will see is 70ft, but i could mark on that no problem?  Best of luck to you, im curious what theyll say as well"
827953,misfish,2014-01-01 19:52:00,29133,"It was crystal clear til that mark really. 80 fow it started to fade.  If I left the line to set,it would mark,and then some times,I had to jig to see it.  Very frustrating morning,"
827957,davey buoy,2014-01-01 20:00:00,5505,"It was crystal clear til that mark really. 80 fow it started to fade.  If I left the line to set,it would mark,and then some times,I had to jig to see it.  Very frustrating morning, Will be interesting to see why many similar fish finders seem to have that problem in that depth range.You would think with todays technology,and that price range that shouldn't be a issue. Keep us updated Brian"
827961,manitoubass2,2014-01-01 20:04:00,11391,What were you using weight wise?
827963,BillM,2014-01-01 20:08:00,17367,"Gotta remember Kemp has quite the current (I'm assuming this is where you were). Not unusual to have a hard time picking up your bait sometimes.  Sounds like your bait was drifting out of the view of your ducer.   If that Elite has a duel beam transducer, pick one or the other and see if that helps."
827965,misfish,2014-01-01 20:08:00,29133,"3/8 oz, the williams would show real strong when left alone.  Line was straight down today Bill. First thing I said,maybe current."
827969,manitoubass2,2014-01-01 20:19:00,11391,Wow i would think that would show no problem??? I can mark a hook with a shiner at 70
828077,Sinker,2014-01-02 04:44:00,8692,"Id say its current to Brian. Especially with a williams. When you get that lure jigging it scoots all over the place.  Try a meegs type jig and see if it still does it. I have ha5 days where marking my williams got frustrating too. Put on a meegs, or jiggin rap and mark it no problem.  S."

825711,manitoubass2,2013-12-21 16:48:00,11391,"Misfish, mines getting used for the first time today. Lets hope the unit is as good as everyone here says lol"
825712,Terry,2013-12-21 16:50:00,14456,"once it got  setup right, it was like a kid playing a video game that was his first fish with it"
825721,misfish,2013-12-21 17:42:00,29133," once it got  setup right, it was like a kid playing a video game that was his first fish with it  Thanks bud for getting it set up. Once we got rid of that rubber tag line,it was game on.  I love this new toy.  Nothing like playing video game and toasty toasty warm.LOL    At the end Im asking how to get rid of the water temp flashing. I dont have a temp probe.  Thats a tiny tear drop and a maggot that this finder pics up so well."
825723,BillM,2013-12-21 17:46:00,17367,"Wait until you play the game with lakers in 100+ft of water, now that's fun!!!    lol!"
825724,misfish,2013-12-21 17:51:00,29133,"Wait until you play the game with lakers in 100+ft of water, now that's fun!!!    lol!  Cant wait Bill."
825725,BillM,2013-12-21 17:54:00,17367,"The best is when you just drop you bait/whatever down the hole and you see a fish rocket up from the bottom, it will get down maybe 15ft and WHAM!!!!!!   The anticipation is like crack!  lol!  Let's hope we can find some whities this year as well"
825829,manitoubass2,2013-12-22 00:30:00,11391,Turn off the auto crap and adjust manually. This is an awesome lil contraption:)
825831,limeyangler,2013-12-22 00:33:00,5204,They aint bad on a boat either!
826021,manitoubass2,2013-12-22 20:13:00,11391,"I woulda had 3 less fish for sure if i didnt have this unit. When i missed bites i could see exactly what was going on under the ice, and was able to entice bites within seconds. So fun watching what was going on. I had a deadstick going for abit, then all the fish moved. I put on a lipless crank and could watch numerous fish come back to examine then hit. So cool"
826028,misfish,2013-12-22 20:28:00,29133,"It,s a cool machine for sure.  I just found out,it has flasher mode.  This guy is a Wizard.  go menu/sonar options /  split/flasher"
826029,manitoubass2,2013-12-22 20:33:00,11391,"Yeah i seen that. Didnt need the flasher though. Had a hell of a time finding the ping speed lol, just a dummy. Once i found it i was like d'oh! Hahha its right there"
826030,misfish,2013-12-22 20:39:00,29133,"Glad to know,IM NOT THE ONLY NEWBIE at this stuff.  What ever happen to plug and play? LOL"

826145,Fisherpete,2013-12-23 02:40:00,1814,"I have also joined the ranks of the ELITE lol...  I recently picked up the ice kit for my Elite 5 - can't wait to try it out. It has been a great unit for me on the boat - and now it will be an all season unit. The GPS will be great too for marking spots on the ice.  Any of the experts have advice for settings on the ice? I see it has ice mode, but any other tips for setting it up optimally? (sensitivity etc.)  thanks Pete"
826174,Moosebunk,2013-12-23 06:36:00,3970,"It,s a cool machine for sure.  I just found out,it has flasher mode.  You just answered my question.  Try it in flasher mode Brian.  Set your upper and lower limits in the exact range you're fishing, with the lower limit 1 or 2 feet deeper than your total depth.  Shoot a little vid or take a picture if you think of it.  Buddy of mine gave me an X67c as a gift some years back.  Have used Vex's, Marcum's and Birds and do find they are all the same in that, without one you're blind so with ANY one of them you're in the game.  Never had any issue with the X67 but am curious about the Elite.  It's nice to have both sonar and flasher options.  You now have a portable for any season."
826785,misfish,2013-12-26 19:43:00,29133,Here ya go Drew.  It gives a split screen as you can see.  The flasher is easy to use. I thought it would of been harder to read.  This machine is alot of fun when you got lots of fish to play with.LOL    
826786,misfish,2013-12-26 19:56:00,29133," OOPS,for got to do that. One baby step at a time bud.  This is all new to me,but catching on quick.LOL  The more comfortable I get,it,s becoming a better machine."
826885,Moosebunk,2013-12-27 19:44:00,3970,"Thanks Bri.  Again, wasn't sure it had the flasher mode.  There should be other color options for it too if it's like any other Lowrance.  Basically it's same as the X67 but you have a split screen sonar/flasher option which is different.  If changing up down the road I'll strongly consider the Elite as it's dual purpose and a good price.  Would have been a better video had ya got that fish.  I've been out to check on ice weeks ago, and put in a couple hours for pannies.  Season will kick off tomorrow... time to get serious. lol.  Good luck out there bud.  Hope you find some Simcoe greys and whites."
826887,misfish,2013-12-27 19:50:00,29133,"Ya I can change the color. My hands got wet and cold,or would of hung out the vid longer.LOL  We did ok that day.  TERRYS BEEN A GREAT TEACHER"
826892,irishfield,2013-12-27 20:39:00,26272,Great that at least old Terrance can show other's how to catch fish !!
826893,misfish,2013-12-27 20:51:00,29133,"Yup. He shows me,I show him.LOL"
826911,aplumma,2013-12-27 21:33:00,6896,Congratulations you now can watch the fish stare at your bait and not bite. I have the HD7 on the big boat and on a calm day you can watch the fish pass into the beam and move up or down for the bait.    Art
826915,misfish,2013-12-27 21:44:00,29133," Oh they bite.  Wait til laker season.  Why not come up for a Ontario winter,sit yer   ,on some hard water fish week..  Then again,you could visit,Dave,who is just sitting waiting for warmer temps,sipping Rum.LOL"
826917,aplumma,2013-12-27 21:49:00,6896,If time permitted I would head up for some ice time. The big challenge is getting permission for two fishing vacations in the same year. I prefer the summer North trips with the pike active and feeding.   Art
825118,misfish,2013-12-18 22:42:00,29133,"Yup,after watching Terry now for two years playing video games while ice fishing,I figured it was time for me to get with it.  Company bonus made my choice easy.  The bag matches my new  Ice Armour suit as well. Got to look good when yer out there.  It was the last unit they had. Lucky me.    The two small cases are a nice bonus.    Hey Terry,MORE POCKETS.HAHAHAHA    Can wait to use it this weekend.  It came complete. Bag,ice ducer,battery and charger.  $249 after $50 dollar rebate.    LETS GO FISHING."
825119,MCTFisher9120,2013-12-18 22:47:00,3761,They sell fast hold onto it for sure great unit's the 4X and Elite 4's are  Nice buy!  MTBF

Couldnt pass that up. I was going to go with the 5x,but this will do me just fine. No more B&W  screen. LOL"
825150,Richie Razor,2013-12-19 00:32:00,536,"Yeah, I got one of the original lowrance ice sonars, and the colors will change your life"

825155,Dan668,2013-12-19 00:41:00,1120,Great unit for the ice the elite 4. I sold my portable unit. Have to figure out how to make my hds8 portable.
825156,Joeytier,2013-12-19 00:56:00,3990,Lowrance makes a portable 'ice pack' for the HDS units...
825167,Dan668,2013-12-19 01:53:00,1120,Won't fit the 8  unfortunately
825170,limeyangler,2013-12-19 01:59:00,5204,Holy smokes…you gotta a sweet deal on that. ENJOY!  
825174,manitoubass2,2013-12-19 02:18:00,11391,"Same unit i bought after limyangler chewed me out and hurt my feelings:( hahahah. Havent used it yet thought, but hoping for LOTW saturday if the slush settles. Hope you have fun with yours! I like the lil jig cases, thats what sold me lol. Filled it with 1/8oz to keep the weight down haha"
825181,limeyangler,2013-12-19 02:53:00,5204,Damn right i hurt your feelings….lol.

825200,hockeyplayerz_14,2013-12-19 08:17:00,160,great buy and the suite is great aswell
825205,steelhedrmatt,2013-12-19 11:21:00,278,"Great unit for the ice the elite 4. I sold my portable unit. Have to figure out how to make my hds8 portable. I use the same unit as portable.  I bought the ice ducer at radioworld, and used a hard sided coleman cooler bag with a zipper top.  Fits the unit, ducer, and 2 batteries. I also bought an extra skimmer transducer with suction cup, to make it a summer portable pack for when we do our yearly fly-in. Works great, and a lot cheaper than buying the lowrance portable pack."
825221,NAW,2013-12-19 13:05:00,4022,What are you doing Sunday morning?  Wanna light that screen up with Crappies?
825256,Salmonidstalker,2013-12-19 17:10:00,265,"Brian, Ive heard from sales reps that this particular finder doesn't pick up much past 80 fow as an fyi.  That has been the only complaint.  Something to think about....and maybe a report of how it works in your opinion."
825258,quickme,2013-12-19 17:20:00,261,congrats!!  Love my Lowrance and Ice pack.  I would recommend that you take a few videos' of the screen as you'll go through withdrawal during the days you can't go out and when the ice gets thin in spring.
825275,Dan668,2013-12-19 18:38:00,1120,My friend used his on simcoe in 110ft. No issue's
825276,Thrilla,2013-12-19 18:43:00,164,It says it can read up to 800' ....
825284,misfish,2013-12-19 19:02:00,29133,"I hope your wrong VXP.  But if this is the case. It will go back quick. Problem is, I wont be fishing those depths til Jan 1st."
825460,Steel28,2013-12-20 16:46:00,160,"Nice choice Misfish. I had Marcums (LX-3/LX-5, Vex FL 18) and moved to Lawrence x67c and now to Elite 4x."
825490,quickme,2013-12-20 21:02:00,261,best tip for finding your lure in deep water with a Lowrance is to Feather the lure down until you see it on the screen.  This way you can keep the lure in the cone.  You can not just flip the bail wait for it to hit the bottom and think it will show up.   If you do that and you want to kick your lowrance to the curb I will be happy to take it off your hands for $100    PM me if you want my set up doc for my X67 Misfish.  Most Lowrance's work the same.   Nick
825496,misfish,2013-12-20 21:41:00,29133,"Thanks Nick  I got the guru of all gurus, to get me locked in.  Right MR.GURU? LOL"
