827823,kickingfrog,2013-12-31 23:53:00,8333,That's a great photo. Wonder if you asked around if someone in her family might know something about it.  I've got some that I posted years ago here that I'll see if I can find.
827830,Bernie,2014-01-01 00:13:00,3190,Have quite a few oldies.  
827833,kickingfrog,2014-01-01 00:17:00,8333,"Early 60's Lake Nipissing, Hinchburger Bay. I think that's my grandfather.   My dad, same place and time.   Grandma and grandpa   Not sure on the date, but likely mid to late 60's    My dad's 2 older brothers. That Evinrude (on the dock) sat around the cottage for most of the 70's and the early 80's before getting put back on to a transom of a Giesler cederstrip in the late 80's. If I can a photo of that I'll post it too. "

Me and my brother,  I'm the taller one  . 1978    My ""big"" pike when I was 2/3(?). For years afterward I would talk about that pike and would always stretch my arms as far apart as they could go to say how big it was or say ""It was as tall as me.""  "
