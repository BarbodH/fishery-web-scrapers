828153,leaf4,2014-01-02 21:57:00,2466,"that's seriously messed up, glad he got his stuff back but no one should have that done to them ever especially someone like this guy, though I'm sure whoever it was didn't really care who he was"
828154,Roy,2014-01-02 22:12:00,13728,I'm trying to figure out what this has to do with Vancouver.
828155,Christopheraaron,2014-01-02 22:13:00,3525,To be fair Banff is a long ways from Vancouver.
828156,Christopheraaron,2014-01-02 22:13:00,3525,Roy beat me to it.
828157,bare foot wader,2014-01-02 22:14:00,1354,"Vancouver has too many violent people!!! first the Stanley cup riot then this! haha kidding,   half the city is from Ontario...what does that say?  LOL  sad deal, glad flash got his stuff back at least"
828158,leaf4,2014-01-02 22:18:00,2466,"lol my bad, forgot it was AB haha brain fart on my part oooops"
828160,BillM,2014-01-02 22:32:00,17367,It's funny what some news outlets conveniently leave out just to make a feel good story.   Read this.  http://deadspin.com/man-beaten-up-while-running-across-canada-to-raise-mone-1492827931?utm_source=recirculation&utm_medium=recirculation&utm_campaign=thursdayAM  And specifically this part.   
828173,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-02 23:48:00,8243,"The guy partied a bit too much and got into it with a few others probably in the same shape and left his bag behind. By the time the ""news"" hits the wires he was mugged and robbed by Canadian thugs. I'm just glad he wasn't hurt nor was anyone else. With all this social media stuff a New Years party scuffle becomes big news and he raises more money. I'm glad he only received a head ache.  Why are we talking about this, any fishing today to report?"
828175,Skud,2014-01-02 23:52:00,739,If he was mugged he would have went straight to the police and then straight back to the room where he was attacked to get his stuff. He had to sober up first I guess or was too drunk to remember the room number.
