Lots of time inside the last couple of days. Lots of good food too….put on a few pounds….lol.  New years supper was awesome, but in our house we think the best thing about having a roast lamb supper is you get to have Lamb Sharwarma Kebabs the next day!1) Spice the lamb with curry powder, garlic powder, cumin powder, coarse sea salt and cracked black pepper (secret ingredient is a chicken oxo cube sent from England) a touch of olive oil and broil on hi until the lamb gets crispy. 2) Warm some pitta bread to stuff it all in when the lamb is just about done, I have coleslaw(no dressing), lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, fresh flat leaf parsley, pepperoncini peppers and some lemon and lime wedges to squeeze over the top. 3) For your chilli sauce use Old El Paso Taco sauce and add (to taste) cumin powder, franks hot sauce or tobasco, and some Dry Garlic Sauce (available at Walmart)…….   I'd say for homemade it is pretty darn good….had worse in Lebanese restaurants!                 lamb is awesome…….i'll probably get shot for saying it….WAY BETTER THAN MOOSE!"
