827499,aplumma,2013-12-30 22:05:00,6896,I am betting the quotes are going to be at a premium till they get caught up with the damage done. If you can stabilize it till this spring you will not pay as much.    Art

If you can stabilize it till this spring you will not pay as much.    Art The trouble with that as a relative of mine has found out is that until the offending trees are removed you CAN'T get your hydro hooked back up because it is too dangerous for the workers.  vance
827507,aplumma,2013-12-30 22:25:00,6896,Ahhh good point I didn't think about that as an issue. That would put you in the category of being bent over the barrel. lol  Down here the power company will destroy the trees as needed to restore power and the homeowner is responsible for getting it to the ground and cleaned up. In fact if you drop a tree on a power line you are fined for not calling them out first to trim it to a safe distance from the line. They also have the right to maintain any trees on an easement that you turn over to them to get power to your house. The trees are trimmed in concern of the lines not for how they will look after they are done butchering them.    Art
827508,irishfield,2013-12-30 22:31:00,26272,"The real issue in Toronto, Art, is you can't cut any trees over, I believe, 6"" in diameter without a mega dollar permit.. and in m any cases they won't let you cut at all. I commented to someone in the city the other day that the ice storm = a wonderful excuse to get rid of any tree you don't want right now. Cut it down.. clean it up and say the ice storm damaged it and you had no choice."

827517,jedimaster,2013-12-30 23:34:00,3472,Yes well the city has a 6 week moratorium on tree permits. So the arborists are wringing people dry. Hurts the people that are in a bind.
827521,Joey,2013-12-30 23:46:00,9122,"They said in the paper today they are waiving those permits right now under the circumstances.  It says Quote:  ""To eliminate a hazard, the city is waiving the need to obtain tree removal permits in cases where trees are greater than 30 centimeters in diameter."""
827524,irishfield,2013-12-30 23:49:00,26272,"So it's over a 12"" diameter tree.. thanks Joey for clarification! Probably lots of people on the Don Valley reserve hackin and wapping right now."
827527,bigugli,2013-12-31 00:04:00,6138,"Not the first time they have had a post storm moratorium on cutting permits. As for costs, Toronto has always been 2-300% more costly than the same services provided by arborists outside the GTA"
