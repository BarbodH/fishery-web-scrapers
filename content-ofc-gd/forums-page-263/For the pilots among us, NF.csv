827851,Cast-Away,2014-01-01 01:47:00,790,"I joined a club up my way a few years ago, got my wings and have a blast! I've made a bunch of new friends as well. The whole hobby is moving away from Nitro and Gas over to electric which is much less expensive and cleaner. If you've always wanted to try it most clubs will let you try a test flight with an instructor to see if you like it. You can then join and get free instruction and eventually buy your own plane."

I've always loved rc aircraft, the edf fighters are amazing, in terms of speed/looks/performance to cost their much easier to maintain than gas aircraft"
