I'm a Nissan truck guy, but drive Fords (f150) for a living and I can attest they take a really good beating all around.  Hopefully they (Ford) pony up and make this a real solid platform. Fingers crossed."

The new ones are not as tough.Had a 1977 full size Bronco. What a great truck that one was. Love to have a new one with the new engines made today in it. Be a great combination."

827657,Muskieman,2013-12-31 16:25:00,2472,^^^^ as a previous Jeep owner ... I just assume that Ford wouldn't put out an inferior product and would like to reflect the Bronco's legendary reputation.
827666,grimsbylander,2013-12-31 16:56:00,3016,Are we forgetting the Bronco II? They should have picked a different name.

827822,GBW,2013-12-31 23:52:00,8460,that concept definitely has jeep written all over it. Maybe the newer Jeep's have the 70's Bronco's written all over them...

827314,Rod Caster,2013-12-30 02:31:00,5784,Not bad. Still like the Cherokee better and it's not a concept
827322,BillM,2013-12-30 02:57:00,17367,"I wonder if that prototype will ever make it to production, those photos have been around a while."
827344,Freshtrax,2013-12-30 03:53:00,2215,I'd buy it in a heartbeat

827377,buick14,2013-12-30 14:12:00,741,I'd buy one any day

827380,woodenboater,2013-12-30 14:40:00,2277,Kinda looks like the Nitro
827390,Flappn,2013-12-30 14:46:00,245,I'll take a 2 door stick diesel pls.
827391,Joeytier,2013-12-30 14:47:00,3990,Awesome.  I'd get the 4-door diesel in a heartbeat.  Who would make the smaller diesel for Ford?
827404,mepps,2013-12-30 16:38:00,1301,not bad at all! I've always wanted them to bring back the Bronco!
827411,Muskieman,2013-12-30 16:58:00,2472,"Ford have had thousands of those Diesels ready now since '07 I think , they were supposed to appear in the F-150, same as their 6.0TT but smaller. Nice looking ride .."
827420,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-30 17:25:00,10439,I bought an '89 new back in the day. It was a nice truck and very comfortable. I kind of miss it but not the horrible gas mileage. I think one of those new 4 doors with a diesel would be sweet.  It's a poor pic but it's a scan of an old photo.  
827423,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-30 17:33:00,10439,The prototype is meant to bring back the look of the 1st gen Broncos of the 70's. I think it does a great job with updated styling.  1974 Bronco    2015 Prototype

827456,RDR,2013-12-30 19:32:00,125,"Cool looking Concept Dave! Not much being discussed recently in the Bronco section of this forum http://www.blueovalforums.com/forums/  There is still a remote possibility that Ford will roll out this model for the 2015 model year. Depending on which Global Platform they choose to run it on. Assembly plants are designed for quick changeover, in order to accomodate new product in a more timely manner. They like to call it ""Flexible Manufacturing"". First and foremost, the market must be able to support any new endevours.....My feelings are, Ford is a little heavy on the small to mid-sized CUV/SUV segment at this time. This design is unique to what they currently offer, so it may squeak thru if the numbers are right. As I have learned over the years, never say never, in the auto industry"

827498,aplumma,2013-12-30 22:04:00,6896,2015 models are already in production. If they were going to have it out it would be introduced as soon as March 2014. The 2015 Ford Tvan should be out at least here in the States at any time my local dealer told me they have already placed an order for a few and are hoping for March to be the delivery date.    Art
