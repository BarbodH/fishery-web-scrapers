To start off, I went to Bay of Quinte for the first time, it was pretty good to say the least but if the fish are off there off so had a great morning but then not much happened. I was meeting up with a good friend of mine, when he pulled up another one of his buddies shows up, when I was helping my buddy unload his sled I herd a voice that I recognizedâ€¦..away we went on the sleds and quads and went to our first spot. I set up my hut and the voice I recognized happened to be worm dunker! I fished with Brian back in 2012 on Nippising and it was very nice to see him, also id like to thank him for lunch! heres a few pics from qunite    My buddy rob with a tank    and now for lady simcoe herself, being how young I am I decided to sacrifice a wild night of partying for fishing on new years, I went up to the cottage on dec 31, and fished the 1st and 2nd managed to ice a few lakers and its nice to see the whitefish back on the ice!    Happy new years everyone!"
