Jack (my 4 year old son) is so happy that it is out again after missing out last year.  Went back to get a couple of pics on a brutally cold evening (-33C), but the clear skies made for some great Fire&Ice shots at sunset.  Feeling very blessed to have a wonderful loving family,  a few trusted, loyal friends and many friendly acquaintances and living in a stunningly beautiful part of the world(with some pretty decent fishing).  Hope you all have a great new year….HEALTH AND HAPPINESS to you all!                       "
