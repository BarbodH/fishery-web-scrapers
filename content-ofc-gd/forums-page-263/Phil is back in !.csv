828207,Sinker,2014-01-03 02:27:00,8692,How do you even find that crap?  You think duck dynasty is bad?? Give your head a shake!  S.
827122,darsky,2013-12-28 23:52:00,586,says filming starts in the spring. Freedom of speech prevails.
827123,lurechucker,2013-12-28 23:53:00,28,im so happy im glad a&e gave in
827124,Christopheraaron,2013-12-28 23:53:00,3525,I think you mean ratings speak
827133,davey buoy,2013-12-29 00:21:00,5505,I think you mean ratings speak Well planned!!!
827141,tb4me,2013-12-29 01:17:00,3295,dont matter that show was on the decline anyway.. One more season and its over IMO
827233,SirCranksalot,2013-12-29 21:14:00,3291,o  dont matter that show was on the decline anyway.. One more season and its over IMO  as Batman used to say----good riddance to bad rubbish.
827255,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-29 22:50:00,4399,o   as Batman used to say----good riddance to bad rubbish. 
827259,Steve,2013-12-29 22:52:00,2075,i think this was a last ditch effort to keep ratings up on the show.  my expectation is a&e suggested phil do something to create some controversy.  likely all fell into their plan to save the show for a couple more seasons.
827293,darsky,2013-12-30 01:28:00,586,me thinks you are all incorrect but hey-that's just my opinion Jack
827405,jedimaster,2013-12-30 16:39:00,3472,"I did enjoy the first season or two but it is possibly the most fake and scripted ""reality"" show on tv and I use reality loosely."
827535,Sinker,2013-12-31 00:25:00,8692,"It may be scripted, and kinda getting ""old"", but its the only show I see on TV that actually has good morals, ethics, and family values. I watch it for that alone. The rest of the scripted ""junk"" I just turn a blind eye to.  S."
827536,GBW,2013-12-31 00:32:00,8460,I'm just glad that they won and didn't fold. The family that is.  That and that A&E catered to the masses rather than a few (based solely on % of people) who possibly don't watch the show but jumped all over it when Phil said what he did.
827547,woodenboater,2013-12-31 01:38:00,2277,agree with others re:the over the top scripting. what's the point of showing 'real people' if you're not going to show the real deal ? was an off and on watcher of DD. Swamp People > Duck Dynasty by a country mile. Also love this show...http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/life-below-zero/
827548,SirCranksalot,2013-12-31 01:43:00,3291,"its the only show I see on TV that actually has good morals,  His mag piece sure didn't sound like good morals! Sound more akin to bigotry to me>"
827720,Sinker,2013-12-31 18:54:00,8692,"Hey, he has a right to his opinion, just like you and I do. If you don't agree, so be it.  S."
827751,nancur373,2013-12-31 20:23:00,1211,"Hey, he has a right to his opinion, just like you and I do. If you don't agree, so be it.  S. "
827754,misfish,2013-12-31 20:29:00,29133,"Ya,it,s a rednecknewfie thing ."
827758,SirCranksalot,2013-12-31 20:55:00,3291,"Hey, he has a right to his opinion, just like you and I do. If you don't agree, so be it.  S. I didn't say he had no right to his opinion. I just said that I wasn't about to cede any moral high ground to that sort of thing."
828078,Sinker,2014-01-02 04:49:00,8692,"I still think the morals shown on that show are better than 99% of all the shows on TV. If you want to pick on morals, watch some of the kids shows on YTV. I dont allow it in my house!  S."
828082,limeyangler,2014-01-02 05:25:00,5204,"I say forget TV for your morals and family values, switch the darn thing off, get outside and do something with your family, instead of relying on some ridiculous 'reality' show to set the example, lead from the front!"

828103,SirCranksalot,2014-01-02 14:22:00,3291,"I still think the morals shown on that show are better than 99% of all the shows on TV. .   Comparing to other garbage on TV? Nothing like setting the bar low! Like you said, you're entitled to your opinion. Have fun with that!"
828107,Rich,2014-01-02 15:02:00,3927,I actually LOL'd quite a bit when I saw this. Wow. Solidified as an obvious publicity stunt by an obvious group of actors.
828144,Steve,2014-01-02 20:34:00,2075,but they are good actors!  fooled many folks out there.
828181,bigugli,2014-01-03 00:27:00,6138,"Bread and circuses, folks. Bread and circuses to entertain and distract the plebeian masses."
