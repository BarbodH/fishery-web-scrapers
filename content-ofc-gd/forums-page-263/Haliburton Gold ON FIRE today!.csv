826967,leaf4,2013-12-28 02:31:00,2466,"nice! just slaying them, sure would like to get out that way for some of that. maybe simcoe or dalrymple is in my near future...."
826976,Freshtrax,2013-12-28 03:04:00,2215,One of them walleye dont look like the others
826977,Roy,2013-12-28 03:07:00,13728,One of them walleye dont look like the others  Probably adopted.
826978,Roy,2013-12-28 03:08:00,13728,"Good shootin', Greg."
826984,jayess,2013-12-28 03:14:00,187,Not meaning to start any trouble but I thought walleye is closed in hali until jan 1st?  Edit: disregard -- my misread!  Beauty fish.
826985,irishfield,2013-12-28 03:17:00,26272,Walleye is open just about everywhere.. it's Lakers that are closed until Jan 1st.. except on the 50+ year round lakes in zone15 and why Greg isn't too worried about someone figuring out which lake he was fishing!
827006,Acountdeleted,2013-12-28 04:17:00,2562, Probably adopted.    Those two photos are what dreams are made of. Great fishing.
827008,Dan668,2013-12-28 04:25:00,1120,Awesome catch. Hoping to get out soon.
827025,davey buoy,2013-12-28 13:32:00,5505,Awesome catch!!!
827031,woodenboater,2013-12-28 14:55:00,2277, Probably adopted.  lol
827032,NAW,2013-12-28 15:04:00,4022,Nice Greg!  Good job man!
827033,Slayingm,2013-12-28 15:06:00,204,Walleye is open just about everywhere.. it's Lakers that are closed until Jan 1st.. except on the 50+ year round lakes in zone15 and why Greg isn't too worried about someone figuring out which lake he was fishing!  Right on Irishfield and believe there is nearly 70 lakes in Hali with a year-round open season for Lakers. Was a treat to be out this early in the season for sure.
827042,Acountdeleted,2013-12-28 15:40:00,2562,Time to scour fish online again. I don't want to wait until the 1st.
827066,Nipfisher,2013-12-28 18:24:00,2449,"Wayne, Don't for get the stupid Lake Nipissing rules. The whole lake is shut down until Jan 1st."
827068,misfish,2013-12-28 18:27:00,29133,Nice haul Greg. Beauties.
827076,irishfield,2013-12-28 18:42:00,26272,"Yah for sure Nip... but we're talking zone 15 here. As for 11... I'll be playing in that zone come Tuesday!.. well maybe Friday as Tue, Wed, Thur are to be -35c!  As Greg has shown, zone 15 has to be one of the best winter playgrounds there is... especially with early ice, but be very aware of your lake situation and ""chip.. chip...chip chip"" your way out. Most of these lakes have current and springs."
827522,GBW,2013-12-30 23:47:00,8460,"Mr. K, you post good fishies...."
827551,GbayGiant,2013-12-31 02:03:00,1780,&nbsp;  What a dog does.
827900,Slayingm,2014-01-01 16:10:00,204, Probably adopted.  Lol!!!... ya the adopted Laker was a bonus fish for sure and caught in the same holes the walleye were. We also broke off x2 pike so were getting various species in the same area.
828074,moparhawk,2014-01-02 03:31:00,146,That first picture of you with that Mule should be on a magazine cover.
828084,wormdunker,2014-01-02 08:08:00,1711,Awesome fish!  Thanx for the photos.  Now I'm pumped!
