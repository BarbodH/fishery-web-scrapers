It turned out to be a good choice, there was only about 2"" of snow on the lake, no slush, and a good solid 12"" of ice!  I even got to try my new 20V DeWalt drill out on his 8"" auger, boy does that work slick but we could only drill 4 holes per battery. None the less, it still made it one heck of a lot easier than me trying to crank that 8"" auger.  The fishing was slow, I did manage to catch a nice 17"" rainbow and another fellow managed to land two of them. All in all a super day to be out in the fresh air with a good friend!"
