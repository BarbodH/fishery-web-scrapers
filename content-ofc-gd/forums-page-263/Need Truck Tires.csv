826405,Angler management,2013-12-24 04:54:00,280,"I think the BF ats is well worth the extra money, but my second choice would be the wrangler ats. Also take a look around for used tires. Tons of great deals out there. I bought the wranglers with about 90% tread for $300 cash installed!!! And couple years back i had a ford f150 with 20"" wheels and the tires were gone just before my lease return. I also found a set of bridgestone duelers with 60% tread installed for $200."
826433,aplumma,2013-12-24 13:03:00,6896,I have been a bridgestone fan for many years running them on both the pick up and the work van. They are good solid tires and while we do not get the same amount of snow you all do the snow we do get can be as much as 24 inches in a dump. The van will not push thru safely more than 13 inches but the 4x4 will go where I point it.   Art
826566,mike rousseau,2013-12-25 03:43:00,4661,High jack away...  I've made my mind...  General grabbers AT2  Stepping from 285 65 r18 to 275 70 r18....
826568,BillM,2013-12-25 04:00:00,17367,Those tires are going to be almost identical.
826571,mike rousseau,2013-12-25 04:53:00,4661,"Yup  0.5"" slimmer and 0.3"" bigger outside diameter....33""  They don't make the exact same size... I have now...  I either go back to 275 65 r18 wich was stock... Or 275 70 r18 to try to match my current tires..."
826573,Freshtrax,2013-12-25 06:58:00,2215,Check out cooper SSt.  Great reviews an way Cheaper than any comparable tire.

826866,SBCregal,2013-12-27 17:26:00,688,"I have the grabber at2's as well and have had them on my truck for about a yr or 30k km or so.  They work really well, only problem I have had is them going out of balance.  I've read a few reviews complaining about the same problem.  Canadian Tire keeps doing it for me for free because it keeps happening... 3 times so far.  Next time they go out Canadian Tire is going to replace them, I paid the extra 7 bucks per tire for the warranty and fully intend on taking advantage of it."
826878,leaf4,2013-12-27 19:12:00,2466,"Would that not be an issue with your rims? because it's not actually the tire that is out of balance as much as it is the rim having slight warping from bumps etc, a higher profile tire you shouldn't have these issues with so it's kind of surprising"
826922,Dan668,2013-12-27 22:27:00,1120,Anything but Mickey Thomsons.. Junk
827018,mike rousseau,2013-12-28 08:30:00,4661,Going out of balance... To my knowledge... Is caused by either losing a weight... Or uneven tire wear
827046,ch312,2013-12-28 16:24:00,1590,$127-250 for shipping depending on what warehouse I want them from....  Zip code 13662.... According to tire rack quote...  We've had 2 sets of tires shipped directly to pep boys in Buffalo on 2 separate occasions and shipping was under $40 both times.
827163,SBCregal,2013-12-29 04:35:00,688,"The first time it was because it threw a wheel weight.  The other two or three times it has been the tires.  The rims have been checked and are straight.  They'll balance up and in 10-12k they'll start vibrating again,  if you look you'll find plenty of people with the same experience.  A good balancing with a roadforce machine should be able to get it done properly but there isn't a canadian tire local to me that has one.  Ryan"
827168,Freshtrax,2013-12-29 05:45:00,2215,Is it a diesel?
827169,SBCregal,2013-12-29 07:06:00,688,"My truck? no, its a half-ton chev.  Tires are always inflated at the proper pressure, suspension is tight and theres no play, alignment is good.  I am confident in the problem being the tires.  Like I said, they work great I have only the one issue with them."
827347,Freshtrax,2013-12-30 03:59:00,2215,Reason I asked is my cousin spins his duramax rims inside of his 35x12 hancooks on dry pavement while lighting them up.

So I'm looking for your personal opinions/experiences with truck tires... Make and model would help...  I'm leaning towards Goodyear Wranglers... I think I can get them installed for about $1000....  I prefer the look of an all terrain tire... But I'm open to all suggestions... Performance out ways looks now that I'm getting older... Lol  I'm looking for all seasons....  These are going on my f150 4x4... I tow 1-3 times a week with this truck...  Size 275 65 r18   So... What rubber do you like???  Thanks  Mike"
826232,fish_finder,2013-12-23 17:39:00,370,"If you want something very similar to the BF ATs, General Grabber AT2 are excellent.  Nearly identical tread pattern to the BFs and priced about the same as the wranglers.  I have these tires on my truck and love them.  http://www.generaltire.ca/productdetails.php?id=grabberat2"
826233,misfish,2013-12-23 17:41:00,29133,  Also look into Cooper tires.
826234,Raf,2013-12-23 17:44:00,3495,I've been running Firestone Destination A/Ts on my Jeep.  Would definately buy again.   I've heard good things about the General Grabbers too although I've no personal experience with them.   My opinion is the BF ATs are overpriced and overhyped.  check tirerack.com for reviews.
826235,Lape0019,2013-12-23 17:45:00,647,I had an 04 f150 and when it was time to change tires (same size as yours) my compromise between price and looks were Bridgestone Dueller AT2's from Costco. The reviews were good and they came to about $1200 installed. I had them on for a full winter and up to July when I got rid of the truck and I never had a complaint about them.
826237,fishnsled,2013-12-23 18:22:00,3520,"Just replace the tires on the Ford in the summer.  With looking to get a new vehicle next year I didn't want to spend a ton either.  Ended up going with a crappy tire set as they had pretty good overall reviews on CT site and other off roading forums.  I went with these.  http://tires.canadiantire.ca/en/tires/winter-tires/product/0062127P/motomaster-total-terrain-w-t-for-light-trucks-suvs/1082009/  After having them for a few months (and about 25k on them)  I'm pretty happy with them for the price but they are a noisy tire though.  I've had the BFG's and Michelin's in the past and they are a better tire but at almost half the price the Motomasters are not too bad of a bang for your buck.  Would they be my first choice in a tire, no.  But have served me well so far.  (BTW - I picked mine up for a buy 3 get one free event)"
826238,mike rousseau,2013-12-23 18:44:00,4661,I can get these for $900 all said and done...  That's not bad

826262,Canuck2fan,2013-12-23 20:35:00,1444,If you drive in snow I would NEVER EVER rely on Wrangler all seasons. I had to sets on different vehicles and they were worse than Canadian Tire cheapies on a Jeep and a full sized Ford Van. I bought new Wranglers for the jeep in October the first snow fall in the Jeep they were summer tires only. Replaced them with Michelin LTX's for the winter and never had a traction issue until I sold the vehicle. Not being the sharpest knife I let my scottish side rule when I was offered a steal of a deal on a set of Wranglers for the Ford E150. After the first snow fall I realized my life was worth more than the cost of a set of Michelin LTX's for it as well.
826264,mike rousseau,2013-12-23 20:46:00,4661,Buffalo is a tad far....  I'm in Cornwall... Lol  Im buying I Massena NY

826279,i2cool2fool,2013-12-23 22:26:00,349, I priced around a fair bit  and finally decided on Canadian Tire Motormaster Total Terrain A/T2. Bought 4 for price of three after discussing with the automotive manager. I am very happy with the purchase.

826323,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-24 00:52:00,10439,"Got Goodyear Wrangler Silent Armors on my SUV. Good all around tire, good on ice, snow, sand haven't been in bad mud though. They are pretty quiet on the highway too. They are a little on the soft side and tend to wear a little fast on our roads here in Yellowknife but I liked them enough to buy a second set. The highways department is also using them on their work vehicles here. Unless you are doing a lot of heavy hauling or towing stay away from the E rated version as I hear the ride is pretty poor compared to the lighter versions.  The Toyo AT's are also highly recommended by my local tire guy. Quite a bit more $$$$ though."

826349,Joeytier,2013-12-24 02:24:00,3990,"If most of your 4x4 usage is at boat ramps and you dont spend much time on rough trails, the Wrangler Duratrac/Territory might be a little too rougj and noisy for what you need.  You wont get that kind of treadlife with many A/T's (definitely not the Cooper's or Motomaster's) but I would reccomend the Wild Country XTX (great deal at Caltire) or the Firestone Destination A/T's.  I'm gonna put the M/T's on my truck next spring...awesome tires for a good price"
