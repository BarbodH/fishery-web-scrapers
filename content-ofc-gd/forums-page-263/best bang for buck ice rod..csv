826679,Burtess,2013-12-25 21:22:00,901,Actually those Abu Garcia Veritas combos are very good quality for what you get.  The reels are MUCH better quality than the reels on the St. Croix combos.  Guides with actual inserts (aluminum oxide or similar) rather than the crap  stainless steel inserts on many others.  Yes they are white but its only the blank.... the handles are black....  Burt

826689,bare foot wader,2013-12-25 23:55:00,1354,"the st Croix rods are pretty good for 25-30$...but make sure you check a few out, IMO the guides are not always spined right, and the actions are not always consistent (as is this case with most factor rods lol)  I also really like frabill rods...if you ever see any older discontinued frabill ultra ice or amplifier rods, buy it and then PM and sell it to me hahahah...really good rods and much cheaper than a thorne bros  a lot of my shimano reels are double duty summer and winter, but for strictly ice fishing the newer generation fx and ax models in the 1000 size are hard to beat and they're cheap  HT are not the best quality but plenty good enough for ice fishing and with 50$ you could get 2 combos  for a 50$ combo you have a lot of options and you won't really go wrong with any of them"
826696,johnnybo1,2013-12-26 01:11:00,42,thanks for all the feedback and merry X-Mas to every one. I'm going out tomorrow to go shopping and I have taking everything you have all said into account. I will post back with my purchase and give my 2 cents on why i decided to pick it.  Thanks a bunch have a great newyears
827579,johnnybo1,2013-12-31 04:34:00,42,"hey all,  Ended up getting a medium-light Fenwick rod at CTC. They had a bunch of HT, lightning rods (untra lights only) and a bunch of other brands I was not to sure about. The Fenwick has a pretty sensitive tip, a pretty nice backbone, looked quality and felt the best in my hand plus it was only 30 bucks even though I'm sure I could of found it else where cheaper. I'm going on the ice tomorrow and I didn't feel like going all the way to sail or bass pro.  The reel I have on temporarily is crap and I will for sure be looking into getting a new reel in the near future. Has any one used the BPS Tiny Lite spinning reel? It seems perfect for a ice setup at a great price.  BPS Tiny Lite - http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-TinyLite-Spinning-Reel/product/91147/  I also got a spring tip but it seems real cheap ($1.99 made by sub zero) and the shrink wrap that was suppose to hold it onto the rod wouldn't even go over the first eye. I used electrical tape for now just to try it out but I think it might just get in the way if its constantly falling off all the time.  I will be on the Ice tomorrow bright and early I will post back with a fishing report when I get home.  Thanks for all the advice from you all cheers!  Johnny Boy  "

It was a short day sadly due to 56 Kph WIND GUSTS It just got way to cold out. We fished for 2 hours and then took off. Caught about 40 perch mostly dinks.

826404,manitoubass2,2013-12-24 04:36:00,11391,Yeah your right GBW. When i buy these rods i usually just use the reel for emergencies or backups. Good reels for tough backlake trips your getting beatup is bound to happen

I just want something that feels good in my hand im gonna go over to CT and then SAIL after X-Mas to check out the lightning rods, ugly sticks and st.croix to see what feels good for the the price. I see lots of frabrill at CT and if I can find one I like I might just skip SAIL its 45 mins from where I am and my car is in the shop.  .

I also have a st croix rod that I use for lite presentations for pickerel or whitefish.  Everything else is cheap and functional, as usually if a pick, white or laker smashes my jig, I will know about it!  So I like st croix, they make nice stuff, but certainly don't have a fleet of em!

826448,limeyangler,2013-12-24 14:40:00,5204,"for ice fishing i spend more on the reel. I dont go expensive either but the reel is usually 10-20$ more then the rod. I dont think ive ever had an ice fishing rod i hated, but you seriously cannot go wrong with fenwicks at CT. Awesome rods. I haven't tried the st crouixs though but the way people talk about them on here maybe i should check em out too  The fen wicks are awesome rodsâ€¦..the only reason why i went with the St. Croix is i broke both my fen wick Medium/Heavy last year. I would say they are very similar, although the St. Croix are $5 less and have bigger guides which helps with ice build up."
826450,Fang,2013-12-24 14:49:00,1330,"JB1  If you can get over to fishing world in Hamilton they have a very good selection of ice rods this year. St.Croix's, fenwick's and a few of the new brands  They even had a couple of buckets of Ugly Stik ice rods on sale"
826454,EC1,2013-12-24 15:22:00,930,"Bud, you need to go out there and feel for yourself! Bring a 1-2 foot piece of line tied to a jig you intend on using, and tie it to the tip guide and you shall see how much you like the rod.  St. Croix's bend weird on the blank, but they still work awesome. Fenwick Elite Tech (Not sure about the aetos) bends really nice, except their UL rod is on the stiff side for my liking. I personally fell in love with the 13 Fishing Ice rods this year for the UL. Their Mediums felt ok, but the other 2 mentioned are probably just as good if not better.  I would spend the 50 on 2 rods. 1 Medium & 1 UL. Probably a little bit more money would go on the UL (Because I fish panfish more often than other fish), and then a Lightning rod for the M would probably suffice."
826458,Moosebunk,2013-12-24 15:35:00,3970,"If not already having pretty well all St.Croix rods ( with one Berkeley and a Rapala), I'd probably look at the Fenwick.sticks.  So far more than happy with St.Croix.  Not so much with their longer rods these days though."

826543,Sinker,2013-12-25 01:00:00,8692,"Yep, ive broken a couple st croix too.  My favourite ice rod for larger fish is an old mitchell brush'n rod. 36"" of power, and I cant break it if I try. For pannies, you need a whole different set up...I like ML, because I break the real light rigs all the time. I use a slip bobber for the light biters.  P.s....spend some coin on the reel. its the reel that will lose that big fish. The rod will be fine, but a stiff, frozen, reel that doesnt work well, and has a cheap drag is good for nuthin! I use my quality reels soft and hardwater.  S."

It's cheap, but I've been using another one for many years and it's worked great. OOD sent me a rod recently with a subscription as well so I'm excited to try these new ones out. I'd say go to crappy tire and pick yourself up one. I should note that I was in Bass Pro and they had the same ugly stick and reel combo for the same price as CT. 39 or 35 bux if I recall."
