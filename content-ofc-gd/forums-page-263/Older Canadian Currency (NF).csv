827030,salmon,2013-12-28 14:54:00,334,My father in law has collected these bills and gave these to us. Just wondering if anyone else collects these  
827034,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-28 15:11:00,2582,My dad....who's in his 70's....did the same and gave them to Debbe and I when our kids where born. A couple of years ago we gave half of them to our daughter when our grandson was born. Our son will get his half when he has a family. I told my daughter to pass them on when she has grandkids. Hopefully by then they might actually be worth something. Right now it's just a fun family tradition.
827036,ketchenany,2013-12-28 15:25:00,3229,"Yes, I have few $1 $2 $5 $10. Hopefully the grandkids can appreciate them."
827039,lew,2013-12-28 15:31:00,12766,My wife stashed some away when they were discontinued but I don't recall the denominations or how much she has.
827073,Steve,2013-12-28 18:32:00,2075,"at most recent trading, i'm betting they are worth $188.  i'd keep them to pass on down."
827075,Musky or Specks,2013-12-28 18:38:00,2710,Not bills but I just got some circa 186-70 east coast colonial pennies. One for each of them
827077,irishfield,2013-12-28 18:44:00,26272,"My mother and sister both collected mint $1 and $2 bills, so we have lots around here.. as well as Centennial dollar bills... and as Steve points out are worth face value on any good day.  Now King George $10 bills are another story and I won't say how many of those I have."
827102,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-28 21:46:00,2582,My old man also has some American bills from before confederation I believe. They are hand signed and are for individual states not the united states of america. They have been passed down to him and as far as I know he has never had them appraised. He tried locally once but the local guy said he didn't have a clue and referred my dad to someone in Toronto. If you know my old man driving on a big highway...the 401...is like krptonite to superman so he never pursued it any further.
827104,Joey,2013-12-28 21:50:00,9122,"I have a few, and also some silver dollars and a cougar quarter and a rabbit nickel."
827111,irishfield,2013-12-28 22:15:00,26272,Is that Cougar quarter in your pocket Joey... sorry.. I just couldn't resist!
827112,Joey,2013-12-28 22:27:00,9122,Is that Cougar quarter in your pocket Joey... sorry.. I just couldn't resist!  Hey now

827325,danc,2013-12-30 02:58:00,4677,A new $20.00 bill snapped in half on me a few days ago.
827327,irishfield,2013-12-30 03:00:00,26272,Cold up there...
827340,danc,2013-12-30 03:39:00,4677,Cold up there... Yup. It's either -30 or snowing and milder. Only time I leave the house is to go to the beer store. That's where my $20.00 bill broke in half.
