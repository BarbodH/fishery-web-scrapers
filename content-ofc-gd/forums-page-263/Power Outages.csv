827371,NANUK,2013-12-30 12:33:00,797,Ordered a new Honda generator
827406,Squid,2013-12-30 16:41:00,1656,Thanks to all the hydro workers that worked tirelessly for 12 hrs  on and 12 off until the power was  restored. Most of these employees have yet to celebrate  Christmas with their families.  :santa:
827450,Fisherman,2013-12-30 19:03:00,7201,"Ordered a new Honda generator Well I sure hope it's a new one,  don't think you'll find many used ones."
827478,mercman,2013-12-30 21:00:00,7054,"We were extremely lucky this time. Other than flickering lites and many brownouts, we didn't lose at all. Hydro crews were working around the clock in the area, cutting trees and resetting breakers. I ended up lending my 4000 watt generator to a couple with young kids, about a mile from my place. They at least had heat, lites, and a good Christmas."
827516,SirCranksalot,2013-12-30 23:25:00,3291,"Ordered a new Honda generator   I suggest that, if you decide to buy an emerg generator, that you buy a good quality 1 such as a Honda, Wouldn't want a  tire or Wally mart one not working when you really need it."
827523,Big Cliff,2013-12-30 23:47:00,6899,"  I suggest that, if you decide to buy an emerg generator, that you buy a good quality 1 such as a Honda, Wouldn't want a  tire or Wally mart one not working when you really need it. Honda generators are excellent but even they won't work worth a darn if you leave fuel sitting in them for a year or two before using them. If you are going to spend the money getting a generator, make sure you service it properly.  I have a CTC type one, it is noisy but works just fine (I can put up with a little noise if I need the power). I keep the tank drained when it isn't in use, I change the oil in it every year even if it hasn't been used and I keep the battery on a battery keeper so it is always charged up and ready if I do need it.  I've had this thing for about 5 years now and the only time it got any real use was when Beans lost power a couple of years ago and I took it over to his place for him."

Good words for sure hopefully everyone after the emergency does drain the gas and run the carburetor dry a quick shot of fogging oil and the other issues you pointed out will have it ready for the next emergency.

826523,bigugli,2013-12-24 22:47:00,6138,"Only lost power  for 3 hours.  Still have no phone or internet. Borrowing the  neighbour,s laptop, on  wifi soI can contact folks. TOUCHY BOARD TO GET USED TO."
826558,John Bacon,2013-12-25 02:29:00,3277,"I've got a bro in Scarboro, haven't heard from him yet,  phone rings busy along with all his neighbours.  Maybe have to do a mercy run down there with the Honda tomorrow.  That is what my parent's phone does.  They are on Rogers.  I think a Bell phone will still work if it is not cordless."
826612,Fisherman,2013-12-25 14:31:00,7201," That is what my parent's phone does.  They are on Rogers.  I think a Bell phone will still work if it is not cordless. I think you're right,he's on Robbers too,   got hold of one of his neighbours who said all was back to normal except some of the phone lines."
826619,Joey,2013-12-25 15:09:00,9122,"When I switched from Bell to Rogers, I asked about having a phone when the power is out.  The guy said if you have Bell and a phone that is not cordless, it will work.  If you have Rogers and a phone that is not cordless, it will work for approx 4 hours on the battery back up.  Once that battery dies, you are S.O.L."
826628,woodenboater,2013-12-25 15:51:00,2277,"still got no power but we have a gas stove and water heater (non power vent thankfully) so we can have shot showers and cook up a storm lol.  the honda genny is doing fine but we should have wired a transfer switch to power the furnace. the space heaters can keep us above freezing but like others said, it's like camping. good thing we camp in the winter and late fall  almost tempted to set up the wall tent for serious heatage ha  ha.  we've seen crews all over the place but so far nada. workers say much depends on which feeder we're on etc.. we're fortunate that friends who have power have offered us places to couch surf.  good luck to all who are still waiting for the power. it sucks bags but 3 days or so without power pales to the  problems others are going through today.   merry Christmas and happy new year to everyone at OFC !'"
826644,Entropy,2013-12-25 18:07:00,747,"Do you know how to wire an extension cord up to the on/off switch for the furnace?  Then you'd be heating.  That's what I'd be doing, but have thought it through and know how to do it.  Entropy"
826648,irishfield,2013-12-25 18:15:00,26272,"Like Entropy says... I don't know how big your house/furnace is.. but if you can run a space heater you probably have enough power to run your furnace blower. Pull the wire to the furnace out of the breaker and neutral bar.... use a couple of marrets to attach the two wires to a 14/3 (or better yet 12/3) power cord from the genny and let your furnace to it's thing. If you need to shut down the generator and restart, just unplug or switch off the load before doing so."
826649,Entropy,2013-12-25 18:20:00,747,"""White to bright"""
826656,Fisherman,2013-12-25 19:12:00,7201,"X2 what Wayne said, here's also a vid to show those that it can be done.  Now some of the newer high efficiency furnaces will not work on generators, it's not because it's dirty power, wrong frequency, wrong polarity.    At your main fuse panel the white(neutral) and green(ground) are bonded(connected together).  In most of the generators the neutral and ground are not bonded,  why I don't know, just the way it is.   If you want to google it, the genny neutral and ground can be bonded with no ill effect and then connected as described above."
826718,Tim Mills,2013-12-26 04:25:00,476,We did not lose power but had no tv or Internet until last night.  Some friends left they re homes in the city and went to stay with relatives or hotels.  Was at Princess Auto In Brampton yesterday and they had a number of people lined up for 80 generators they had coming in.  They said they had 150 people on a waiting list as well.
826719,woodenboater,2013-12-26 04:26:00,2277,"thanks for the info all. we've got a switch between the furnace and breaker box. nm from the switch to furnace which I could have pulled out and added a 15 or 20 amp plug if we had to. two neighbours (one's a contractor, other is contractor and apprentice electrician) mcguyvered their own temp solutions but one had a dirty generator which toasted his furnace's board I think.  fortunately power is back but if we were going to be out longer, yeah, woulda done that as a short term solution. still want to add a transfer switch so I can run nm from the outside to the transfer switch and just flip it if it if the need arises. these are things one learns along the way.  other interesting tidbit was re: the 1998 ice storm. talking to a Toronto Hydro guy, I mentioned that at least this one wasn't as bad as The Ice Storm of 98. His reply was that actually the one we just had was pretty close."
826721,irishfield,2013-12-26 04:46:00,26272,"Biggest thing I see with my two generators... you can't use them for the house set on auto idle/throttle unless you have nothing but lights or heaters on them . If you are going to run your fridge, freezer, furnace or well pump you need to set the generator to run full out continuous so there is no voltage or frequency lags that are bound to let the magic smoke out of motors and controllers."
826729,davey buoy,2013-12-26 13:08:00,5505,"Wayne I'm thinking cutting the wire just before the furnace switch.Adding a male plug on the switch side.Female towards the panel.Running a cord up stairs to the power bar that will be powered by the generator. Simply I would unplug the feed from the panel to the switch,plug in the female side of the extension cord and than the male into the power bar.into the power bar. Now when I see the power come back on,just simply reverse the plug in's. It's only a fan motor as you say.Thanks."
826732,SirCranksalot,2013-12-26 13:39:00,3291,If the furnace is a no-go you could get a couple of those ceramic portable heaters to heat the living area daytime and the bedrooms nightime. Just a suggestion.
826738,Ralph Field,2013-12-26 14:18:00,1018,"When I switched from Bell to Rogers, I asked about having a phone when the power is out.  The guy said if you have Bell and a phone that is not cordless, it will work.  If you have Rogers and a phone that is not cordless, it will work for approx 4 hours on the battery back up.  Once that battery dies, you are S.O.L.  I have a major Roger's box outside my fence at the back of the lot and during major power failures they show up with a generator to keep the phones working."
826759,Fisherman,2013-12-26 16:07:00,7201,"Well send them over to Scarberia.  Bro has the power back on, no damage, so lucky.  Managed to get hold of his neighbour with a hardwired landline, all is well on their street.  However some of the areas with the big trees are still snaping and cracking.  Wife noticed something here this morning she hadn't seen in a long time(no not the morning woodie)  our cable/phonelines were galloping."
826769,mbac31,2013-12-26 17:57:00,904,"We still have no power on our street. Probally by Sunday or Monday maybe. I have a generator hardwired and have been running everything off the generator. Ive been cutting neighbours trees for days but bad situation for most. Been cooking stuff for my neighbours and it has brought all people closer. Everyone is helping everyone. If anyone needs any assistance or some help with anything call or email. Be glad to help, im in the east side of scarborough."

827239,bigugli,2013-12-29 21:34:00,6138,We are finally reconnected to the real world.
827244,ketchenany,2013-12-29 22:09:00,3229,"Our power was out for 12 hours, cable/phone/Internet six days. No biggie, only disappointment my Coleman stove hada broken o ring and could not make espresso. Coleman heater for ice fishing worked well but didn't use it.  I may tap CT for a gen when one come up."
827256,NANUK,2013-12-29 22:50:00,797,"Our power came back on early this morning...........after 8 days,"

826347,Fisherman,2013-12-24 02:19:00,7201,Hard to believe there's still a large number of folks out there in the GTA without power.  Don't know how long the average house would go before thing start to freeze up.
826350,irishfield,2013-12-24 02:28:00,26272,"They'll be out for another couple days for many of them by the sounds of it. Nephew just got his power back an hour ago in Scarborough. Saw on a TV, while blasting through the Georgian Mall 2 hours ago, that they were trying to restore power to Sunnybrook Hospital as a priority in the Bayview Ave area."
826352,Terry,2013-12-24 02:31:00,14456,wonder if basspro got their power back on
826354,irishfield,2013-12-24 02:38:00,26272,Still got some Christmas shopping to do Terry... lol
826355,Entropy,2013-12-24 02:39:00,747,"The warnings were in the media last Wed. morn.  I'm sure a good number of people are wishing they had done more to get ready.  Most of the time the forecast that far out fails, but this one sure didn't.  You'll be hard pressed to find a generator, salt, candles, camping cooking and lighting gear, or fuel cans anywhere in the GTA left to buy.  I'm certain there will be a big push on just before our typical spring storm season to sell 'storm survival' items.  You'll see Crappy tire and wallmart selling kits, and generators like mad.  I'm sure there will be some good deals to be had.  Same thing happened after 'the 3 day power outage'.  (what was that 10 years ago?)  A lot of the outages near Port Hope are now saying that they should be restored at 8pm on Dec 26th.  Homes are one thing, they are relatively easy to winterize, if you can find plumbing antifreeze to buy. It's the large commercial and industrial buildings that are going to cost a lot if their plumbing freezes.  Heck if you were in the fire suppression system business, you'll be making good coin getting all those sprinkler systems back up in working order.  Be safe, Entropy"
826356,Terry,2013-12-24 02:42:00,14456,I was going this morning for 7 am  last minute I decided to call and they had no power  and yeah last minute shopping...lol   for me
826357,danbouck,2013-12-24 02:42:00,4380,A friend just outside of Cambridge lost power Saturday and was told today that it won't be back on until Thursday.
826358,Entropy,2013-12-24 03:00:00,747,"Just checked the Hydro One outage map, what a nightmare, the trees are loaded with ice, there is cold weather for the next few days so is it isn't going to melt off, and there are new small outages occurring almost as fast as some are being fixed.  My sister who lives near Millbrook has had power all this time but the outages keep getting closer to her all the time.  There is one down the road from her now, and that might also include her.  It did last spring during that last ice storm.  What luck eh.  Entropy"
826360,SirCranksalot,2013-12-24 03:07:00,3291," Homes are one thing, they are relatively easy to winterize, if you can find plumbing antifreeze to buy.   As I see it, the best thing to do at home is to shut off the water and drain the system as much as possible by turning on a tap in the basement( e.g. laundry tub)"

826368,irishfield,2013-12-24 03:29:00,26272,Almost what I was doing tonight for my brothers kid.... but he just got his power at 7:45.. not sure about phone as he only uses a cell. Nephew is on Military Trail and my brother had just text me to see if he could meet me at hwy 9 with my genny.
826370,Sinker,2013-12-24 03:31:00,8692,"All good here just outside millbrook, but have friends close by who are out. Its a lot worse south of here....newcastle, bowmanville and parts of oshawa were still shut down this morning.  Im good to go here. No worries. Going for a quick hunt in the morning, then getting the christmas festivities going  If anyone around my area needs anything, just ask.  S."
826377,Joey,2013-12-24 03:47:00,9122,Well we finally got our power back this afternoon - Yay!  We did not too badly though and put the taps on a dribble downstairs and upstairs and used the Mr. Buddy for heat and candles for light.  I did an entire crossword puzzle using a flashlight last night  Ralphie was the smart one and knew where to sit.  He'd move when he got too hot.     
826379,irishfield,2013-12-24 03:50:00,26272,Great to have ice fishing equipment... what I told my Nephew to go out and buy before his pipes froze.
826394,Ron,2013-12-24 04:16:00,1683,"Just dropped off my genny to my sister. She lives out in the country so no amenities such as running water. She is a camper though, so no pros surviving the roughing it part. the only concern was the freezer was showing signs of thaw, (shrimp rings are always the first to thaw out). Set up genny got power to her freezer, fridge, fan for propane ""wood stove"", a few lights in the house and all is good to go. Hydro told her no power til the 27th."
826408,Joey,2013-12-24 05:13:00,9122,"Yup, ice fishing and camping gear go a long way in a blackout that's for sure.  Fired up the coleman for coffee and grilled cheese sandwiches  Ron, I can't believe the 27th, that's a long time without hydro.  I noticed that two streets over, they still have no power."
826417,Steve,2013-12-24 07:08:00,2075,"i'm back ---- after 47 hours without power. (3am Sunday to 2am Tuesday)  'twas interesting.  Horizon was good to us...keeping us updated via email and even phone calls. great customer service.  I was just settling into another night of candles, scotch and wine with some music with the wife....no heating devices 'cept about 30 candles in our living room.  now the lights are on, she's cleaning the kitchen, and i'm on the internet.  almost kinda wished they gave us about four more hours....i mean at this point, lol.  hope all affected are almost through this mess."
826422,fishindevil,2013-12-24 09:20:00,6254,"A co-worker of mine lives in east Oshawa courtice area and thy have had no power since Saturday night and they also tried to buy salt and supplies like flashlights and propane heaters and went to several stores and they are all sold out of everything like that !!!! And forget about generators she said some guy wanted $1,000 for a used 5yr old one he was trying to sell it from the back of his truck in a shopping mall parking lot till people told him to f-off !!!!! Can you imagine the nerve ...... That's totally taking advantage of the bad situation !!!! And this morning here in bobcaygeon it's -23 It looks as tho most have power around here but ours has gone out a few times but came back on after 10mins !!!!! In 2011 we had a bad ice storm here in the Kawartha lakes area and we lost it for 3 days so they put in several new poles and new wires and stronger supports for a few miles up to the highway !!! And they cut a few big trees down so I know that's the only reason we still have power as before that we always would loose power several times a year due to storms in summer and storms in winter !!!! So I'm glad we have new stuff running through our little cottage community here on sturgeon lake !!! Hope everyone can stay warm  specially the elderly that live on their own !!!! If you know of any please check on them !!!!"
826427,DanD,2013-12-24 12:32:00,2223,"Did anyone else here about the 50 some year old man and his mother; that died in their home due to carbon monoxide poisoning. I guess he had his generator running in the garage and the fumes came into the house. The silent killer, makes you go to sleep too never wake up; very sad. Portable generators are great; but you have to keep them outside while they're are running or have a proper ventilating system to get rid of the fumes. Two lives gone from lack of better judgement.  Dan."
826428,lew,2013-12-24 12:34:00,12766,News says a Newcastle man and his mom were killed by carbon monoxide from running a generator in the garage last night.  Few more were sickened from BBQ's inside their apartments in T.O.  Gotta be careful out there folks.

826451,Rattletrap2,2013-12-24 15:01:00,1652,"Our friends in Caledon East had the pole on their property snap in half on Saturday. They have been down since then with a couple of small generators going. They have a large Diesel generator on its way today. They don't expect to have power restored until January 6th! They even paid an Arborist company to come in last summer and clear the trees along their hydro lines. They have three poles coming in from the road, but the tall trees still came down on them."
