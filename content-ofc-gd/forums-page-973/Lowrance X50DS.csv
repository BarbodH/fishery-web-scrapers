I realize that it is the bottom of the food chain, but I have some questions about sonar use in general. They are:  1. The manual more or less says to turn off fish ID as it gives a bogus signal. How many of you use the fish ID?  2. If you donâ€™t use fish ID, has anyone ever seen a fish arch?  3. How do more expensive (with out getting ridiculous) units differ as far as quality of information goes?  Thanks in advance! Jim"

I can bounce a jig and minnow off the back of the boat in 35 feet of water and watch the jig going up & down on the screen but have yet to see a single fish arch!! Go figure!! If any one can shed any light on this one it will be most appreciated!!  FT"
243846,Andy,2008-08-27 14:40:00,330,I'll often catch fish where none are marked and I assume it's because they are tight to the bottom. (especially pickeral) Andy
243982,Billy Bob,2008-08-27 20:59:00,5865,I never use the fish mark but rather look and have seen MANY hooks that are fish.
