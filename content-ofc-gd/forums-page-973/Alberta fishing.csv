243782,smbhunter,2008-08-27 04:46:00,186,"I'm heading out to Alberta later this week to visit my brother and want to do some fishing. My brother has lived there for over a year now and hasn't even tried to fish.   Anyway, he lives just outside of Edmonton and we plan on going into Banff for a day or two. I'm bringing a 6 wt fly rod and some flies for the rivers and I figure my brothers equipment and tackle should suffice if we plan on doing some lake fishing, but have no idea where to even start. I would prefer to try out the rivers and get some species that I have never caught before like, cutthroat, mountain whitefish, bull trout, grayling and maybe even goldeye or mooneye, if I can't get anything else. Any info for Banff and/or around the Edmonton area would be very much appreciated.  Thanks."

243817,holdfast,2008-08-27 12:52:00,1813,All I can tell you is around the Edmonton Area.  My all time Favorite lake is Wolf Lake.  It is considered a Trophy lake and its a drive to.  Maybe two hours North east of Edmonton just above Bonneville between Cold lake and Lac La biche.  Even closer is Pinehurst which has Huge Pike.  North of Edmonton maybe an hour is Lac La biche with lots of Lakes.  Check out the Alberta Fishing Forum or Alberta fishing Site for Articles.  Fabulous Fishing Less than two hours Drive.  Also Lesser Slave lake and Pigeon lakes can be good.
243890,Cudz,2008-08-27 16:48:00,2652,You can catch fish in the Athabasca river.  The bow is near Banff. If you want to drive about an hour north of Edmonton there is a nice lake called Amisk (sp?) lake.  Full of walleye and pike. Long lake provincial park is ok as well. Pigeon Lake is just south of Edmonton (I believe) and it has big pike.
243893,cranks bait,2008-08-27 17:13:00,721,"I concur, you can catch fish in the Athabasca (at least I did in Jasper).  Maligne river and lake are also good.  You will need another permit to fish in the national parks (do not forget to get one if you do).  I also believe the moto was ""If it's black put it back"" refering to the bull trout.  I think that's the one anyways."
