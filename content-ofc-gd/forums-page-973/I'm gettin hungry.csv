Also, do you pan fry, deep fry, or saute? Also of importance is your preference of types of oil.  One of my favorites for pan or deep frying is simply to pat the fish in a plate of flour before frying. The difference is to mix thouroughly into the flour cayenne pepper....you can add as much as you want, but i like enough to so that the mixture has a pinkish tinge to each. Try it....it give this basic recipe a bit of a kick.  Damn, I'm getting hungry!"
