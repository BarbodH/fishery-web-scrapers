243800,ccmtcanada,2008-08-27 11:46:00,7971,"As many of you know, my other hobby is music.  I've posted a few songs from my band from time to time on this board.  My band has a channel on youtube, that has garnered some attention over the past few years.  We are at over 450,000 views and have over 330 subscribers to our music.  Anyhow, there are a few people you get to know, and early in my youtube experience, I corresponded with an amateur rock band from the Philippines.  We decided to do a cover song....with me doing the vocals for them.  About a month ago, they recorded all the music to the song and then emailed me the MP3.  I then recorded the vocals and shot a quick video of me doing so last weekend.  The video and music was sent back via email, and the result is what you see below.  The internet can erase the 1000's of kms that separate people....as this board has done for many.  Hope you enjoy this video.  <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auP1lDoZ5_E&hl=en&fs=1""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auP1lDoZ5_E&hl=en&fs=1""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auP1lDoZ5_E&hl=en&fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""425"" height=""344""></embed></object>"

Tours take away too much time from fishing, so I think I'll stay at home......hehe.    Would love to hear your work when it's done!  The internet can erase those miles...pretty incredible."
