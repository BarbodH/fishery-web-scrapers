243944,johnnyb,2008-08-27 19:54:00,3413,"Well I got last minute reservations at the Tea Lake campground in Algonquin for Saturday and Sunday night...not planning anything wild and crazy, just a bit of laid back car-camping with my wife and 8-year old son.  We'll bring the canoe and rods for sure...just wondering what anyone's experience has been in there...or if any lakes that are close by are worth jumping into for the day.  Any and all responses appreciated, as always"
243979,lucabrasi,2008-08-27 20:58:00,114,"If you're referring to Tea Lake on Highway 60 and you don't plan on driving your canoe elsewhere, you'll have to paddle into one of the adjacent lakes; either Bonita, Smoke or Canoe. I've never fished any of these so I can't help you much there, but if you plan on going in deeper, Little Doe and Tom Thomson have good Smallmouth, but these are a good 3 hour paddle in (with short portage). Smoke lake is another story as it can be very dicey to cross with even a moderate wind (been there done that). Don't know how comfortable you are about that with an 8-year old in tow. Why not just fish Tea.  Have a great trip!"
244003,johnnyb,2008-08-27 22:33:00,3413,"We'll more than likely just paddle around on Tea...thanks for the advice on Smoke Lake!  It would be nice to hop into another lake via short portage if only for the adventure...once I get the old park map out, I'll have a better idea. Thanks, Robell"
244007,lucabrasi,2008-08-27 22:47:00,114,No problem!!
244014,Musky or Specks,2008-08-27 23:38:00,2710,Ive seen lots of decent smallmouth come out of Tea.
