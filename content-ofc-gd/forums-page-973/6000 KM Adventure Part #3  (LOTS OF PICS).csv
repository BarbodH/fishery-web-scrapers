244255,mistyriver1,2008-08-28 17:56:00,600,Now that's a honeymoon  Great post and awesome pictures.
244264,The Urban Fisherman,2008-08-28 18:27:00,2050,"Awesome trip dude!  Not many logde/cabin owners would have gone out of their way to pay their pilots wage and gas to fly back up and drop off a gun for you - good for them.  And congrats on the marriage once again, although I think it's totally unfair that you've taken 3 WEEKS OFF!?!?!  Thanks for the report, UF"
244267,Basskicker,2008-08-28 18:45:00,421, I thought that it was pretty nice of them as well....not to rub it in.....but it was 4 weeks....the last 3-4 days at a Minnesota/Ontario border lake that we portaged into that Solopaddler would be impressed when he here's the list of things we brought in.....and barely managed to bring back out.  It was like 5 Star camping.....in the middle of nowhere.....probably lost 5 pounds in 4 hours hours trying to get all the stuff in there. Hard lesson learned.....I really need a  portaging lesson (in-person) from Solopaddler  I'll try to get the report up in the next couple of days.  Jason
243589,BillM,2008-08-26 17:17:00,17367,"Wow, talk about seclusion!!!!  That bear must have scared the crap out of you, I know it would have me   Those pickerel are extremely dark!  Great looking fish..  BTW, I think your friend Chiper is a red squirrel"
243593,fishnsled,2008-08-26 17:32:00,3520,"I can't believe that you didn't take the time to try and get a picture of the bear.  Probably could have had some great close ups.  Oh well, too busy screaming like a girl I guess.  I would have done the same.  LOL!  Congrats on yet another PB and thanks for the great report.  PS- I agree with Bill - Chipper is ared squirrel."
243598,Joey,2008-08-26 17:40:00,9122,"Wow, great report and fantastic scenery pics.  That bear story had me on the edge of my seat.  Maybe it was Bigfoot!!!!  I hear they knock back  Joey"
243600,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-26 17:48:00,957,What a great experience.  Way to go for jumping into such a trip.  Your post was a great read for me since I've done several fall fly-ins when I was the only person on a lake.  Thanks for making my day better.  I'm impressed that Andrea did so well on your trip.  You're a fortunate guy.
243605,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-26 18:09:00,0,Great Story! Very well written. I was definitely entertained.lol I think that is a dock spider. They can get pretty big and they pack an ugly bite. Congrats on your PB pickerel. Sounds like one heck of a honeymoon. Thanks for sharing.
243611,solopaddler,2008-08-26 18:33:00,8605,"Great story Jason, sounds like you guys had one heck of a honeymoon trip!  I've encountered bears on at least 4 occasions at fly in outposts over the years, so it's not that uncommon. They're generally more afraid of you though....no big deal. I would've been po'd about the bbq though  .  A couple years back north of Armstrong we had a big (300lb plus) bear in our camp almost every night lapping up the gray water from the kitchen sink. When I mentioned it to the outfitter midweek he laughed and said ""Oh so you met Fred? If he gives you any trouble just swat him on the butt with a 2X4.""  (The chipmunk is for sure a red squirrel, and I have no idea what the spider is. I've got huge dock spiders on my dock up north and they're more gray/black, and the legs aren't as mottled. I don't think that's what it is...)"
243638,corvette1,2008-08-26 19:43:00,1765,awesome trip the eyes sure are dark congrats on the honnymoon
243644,Garyv,2008-08-26 20:01:00,547,"The Marlin 444 would have stopped the bear especially at short range, although a heart, lung or head shot would be your best choice.  Here is some info on the gun,  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.444_Marlin  I'm glad you didn't have to use it."
243663,Rich Clemens,2008-08-26 21:21:00,3131,Fantastic report Basskicker and some really great shots.  I'm sure this took a lot of time to put up .... Appreciate it and enjoyed all three parts.   Hmmmm ..wonder if there will be a 4th ?
243674,limeyangler,2008-08-26 21:46:00,5204,What a great report. I am still chuckling about the bulging eyes and screaming like a girl...think i would have been the same.
243727,Leecher,2008-08-27 01:14:00,7832,"Breath taking is all I can say.....man o man what a beautiful place  From my personal experience, bears will not get that close to humans and run out of your way in fear of you and if your lucky, you will may be get a glance at it and that's may be......but this one was a little too close for comfort and should be feared.....once the're not affraid of humans is when the problems starts.  A friend of mine worked for a ZEC in Quebec located north of Fort Coulonge about an hour and half drive up a dirt road and while he was as sleep, heard commotion coming from the back of the camp.....he got up and checked it out like you did and found out that a bear was trying to knock the back door down.....so he reached for his riffle and waited until he could get a shot at it....thank god he did.  It was trying to get in for his food that was stored in coolers inside the camp and there was no stopping him.  The owner of the resort made a good decision to bring you a riffle for your protection because that bear did not fear humans and god knows what they are capable of.  For those that are travelling through the bush to get to their destination and come upon a bear that seem to be just standing there.....beware.  Ok enough about the bear stuff..... It sure looked like you guys had a wonderful time up there and the fishing was excellent.  Congratulation on your PB     a very nice eye!  Thanks for sharing Leechman"
243734,Greencoachdog,2008-08-27 01:43:00,8163,Excellent report and pics!!!   What were you going to do with the broom?... sweep the Bear off it's feet???
243812,Basskicker,2008-08-27 12:39:00,421,Thanks guys for the kind replies.....we certainly had a honeymoon to remember.  I am just so thankful that were awake.....I can only imagine waking up to a bear licking my face.  This was our first fly-in ever....but certainly won't be our last. Andrea said that she would love to go every year...lucky me!!!!!  Hey Cliff.....hopefully we can hook-up real soon.  Jason
243865,solopaddler,2008-08-27 15:21:00,8605," Yep, take advantage of it now buddy. Joanne and I did one, sometimes two fly in's every year from the time we started dating and the first couple years of marriage........then we had kids  ."
243866,ccmtcanada,2008-08-27 15:25:00,7971," Then you got a sweet cottage on an amazing lake with beautiful scenery, great back lakes nearby and an excellent fishery.  Jeez....life just sucks for you doesn't it Mike??? LOL.  Not to mention 2 great kids"
243878,highdrifter,2008-08-27 16:14:00,2534,Ah thats totally wild!  Awesome report and pics.  What an excellent idea for a young couple..  I'm sure the missus would dig something like that!  'Gitty up!!  cheers HD
243916,solopaddler,2008-08-27 18:22:00,8605," Yeah bud you're right of course, things are better than they've ever been.  Still, sometimes I look back fondly on the happy go lucky existence of our previous lives. There's something to be said to being able to pack up and take off wherever and whenever you want.  Like I said take advantage of it now..."
243922,ccmtcanada,2008-08-27 19:06:00,7971, I knew what you meant Mike....I was just yankin your chain is all.
244001,scuro,2008-08-27 22:06:00,386,Awesome report...enjoyed reading it. Congrats on the marriage.
244006,johnnyb,2008-08-27 22:41:00,3413,What an AWESOME honeymoon!!    Congrats on the marriage and the great trip...still searching the archives for parts 1 and 2....
244113,Whopper,2008-08-28 11:16:00,2174,"Fantastic report!  This was probably the best honeymoon I have ever heard of  Congrats to you and your wife, I hope you enjoy many more."
244115,Smokey,2008-08-28 11:21:00,1278,"Great report and quite the adventure. I've been doing fly-ins for 20 yrs now and never had an experience like that one, luckily. I've seen my share of bears but never around the camp.  Thanks for all the great pics and what a great honeymoon trip.  Mike"
244154,bigcreekdad,2008-08-28 12:51:00,546,"The prints on the window are awesome, and pretty much says it all.  Great pics and story.....thanks much for sharing."
