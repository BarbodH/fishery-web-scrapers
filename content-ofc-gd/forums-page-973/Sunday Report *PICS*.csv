We slept in, which was tremendous, and got up around 10:30 (my first true sleep in day this summer!) we made a nice big breakfast and decided on fishing.  We chose Horseshoe Lake near Minden.  Never been there before but we figured we'd try it out.  Theres a lot of current in the lake, and not many weeds.  Lots of silt!  I finally came to some narrows where the current was flowing pretty good and there was a hump where the weeds were folded over from the current.  The smallies were sitting under the weeds and eating tubes! Lots of fish around 1- 1.5 pounds on that spot and one about 2.5 pounds.    Kept moving and saw a very light spot in the lake from a distance.  Motored over to it and it was a big bed of THICK milfoil out on a hump in 10 feet of water.  The only thick weeds in the whole lake.  Kelli got a nice 3 pounder on a senko.    Found an island with a downed tree and Kelli got another tank on a senko.    Started fishing some docks in the evening and got a nice 1 3/4 pounder, and on the next dock lost a GIANT.  The fish was 5+ but got my line caught up on the dock post and came unbuttoned.  Ah well, good way to spend the day!!"
243082,Joey,2008-08-25 02:24:00,9122,"Great report.  Some nice sized smallies there.  My grandparents had a cottage on that lake and I grew up swimming and fishing it most of my childhood.  Loved that lake, not many weeds which is great for swimming.  We always caught a few perch and bass off the dock too.  Joey"
243088,Leecher,2008-08-25 02:29:00,7832,Great report and pics Steve  Looks like you guys had a good time. Thanks for sharing Leechman

243166,ccmtcanada,2008-08-25 11:58:00,7971,Great stuff Steve and Kelli!  It's always fun to not have a schedule....just get up whenever and have a nice relaxing day fishing.
243288,corvette1,2008-08-25 16:15:00,1765,nice fish looks like your girlfriend out fished you great report
243409,steverowbotham,2008-08-26 00:45:00,1800,"Thanks all, I definitely was outfished.  But I kinda liked it"
243410,evster,2008-08-26 00:51:00,367,Nice work.  Never a bad thing to be outfished by the lady.
243515,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-26 13:43:00,0,Great Report. Seems like the girls have been catching some big largies this year! Always great to fish a new lake. Thanks for sharing.
243640,steverowbotham,2008-08-26 19:44:00,1800," Johnny Bass, I figured you may have fished it before.  It's really close to Gull, and it was your Gull report that made me wanna try the Haliburtons."
243683,limeyangler,2008-08-26 22:03:00,5204,"Great report, i dont mind being outfished by the 'missus' either."
243684,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-26 22:11:00,0, Cool. Gull lake is the only lake I have fished in the Haliburtons. Apparently that whole chain of lakes is great up there but the price of gas is discouraging me. You should do very well up there. Definitely worth a fall trip.
243773,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-27 03:23:00,2585,great report!  those are certainly some nice bass you and your lady got into!  Cheers!
243902,TJQ,2008-08-27 17:49:00,7806,Very nice report....  poor bass... you were picking on them.
