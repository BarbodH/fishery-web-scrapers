240337,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-17 00:28:00,957,"""Fall Pike Healing"" by Andrew Bunker gives us 10 pages of beautiful photographs and several inches of an interesting read in the most recent EA magazine.  Nice job Andrew.  Don't take my word for it.  Buy your own copy and read it for yourself."
240339,danc,2008-08-17 00:37:00,4677,It's about time he was published. I'm hooking up with him next weekend for Brook Trout. Should be fun.
240351,tbayboy,2008-08-17 01:08:00,1497,"Absolutely about time, hope this doesn't mean we stop getting previews - I'm already looking forward to his Nipigon story (and your photos too Dan hehe)"
240375,duber,2008-08-17 01:52:00,220,Well it is no suprise!Talent like that can't hide for long.  Can't wait to check it out!  Good for you moosebunk.
240551,bucktail,2008-08-17 16:55:00,1857,Very nice! Your pictographies ( spelling) are awesome. Always a high lite of the year for me.
240801,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-18 13:45:00,957,Keeping this on page #1 so more members can get a head's up.  Bunk's photos alone are more than worth the purchase price.
241057,Nemo,2008-08-19 00:48:00,727,  Can't wait to read it....Congrats Bunk
241074,ccmtcanada,2008-08-19 01:25:00,7971,"Awesome!!!  I'll have to get the issue and read it!  After reading his reports, it doesn't surprise me in the least.  I'm waiting for the made for TV moving starring Moosebunk!!!  Congrats Drew!   :clapping:"
242715,scuro,2008-08-24 02:05:00,386,..and to think I fished with a legendary pro...
242726,bpsbassman,2008-08-24 02:40:00,941,"That's awesome and so well deserved although it really doesn't come as a surprise. One of the fringe benefits for the Esox Mag folks being members here.  Hopefully, someone will take advantage of some of the other awesome talent that posts here. Way to go MB!!  :thumbsup_anim:  :clapping:"
242734,Leecher,2008-08-24 03:14:00,7832,Well deserve Andrew....Congratulations

244004,Gerritt,2008-08-27 22:35:00,6129,Just got my copy today... awesome read.. I remember reading this report from Andrew some time ago.. MB was this (Kevin) not the guy you had troubles with??  Anyways a great read none the less!  G
244158,Moosebunk,2008-08-28 13:01:00,3970,Thanks TG and gang.  Was a pleasant surprise when I arrived home to see the issue waiting.  Esox's art director Dave does an amazing job every time I submit him any photos.  He's a real talent and it's cool being associated with such a great bunch there.    Only troubles with Kev is finding him from time to time and hearing how he's doing.
244192,ravinerat,2008-08-28 14:22:00,64,Picked up my copy on the way home and dove into the article. Top notch as usual. Hope this doesn't mean were going to see less trip reports form Bunk.  RR
