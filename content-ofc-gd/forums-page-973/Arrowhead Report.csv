243837,mgrieve,2008-08-27 14:03:00,20,"Went up to Arrowhead Sunday with the Family. We had site 491. Really nice and private site. Actually all sites in the 490's were great (If anyone is interested) Beaches are nice. There are 3 of them. The beach by our site was pretty private.  A bear ate all our food. We left the cooler out by error when we took the kids for a drive in the morning to get them warm. Came back and the bear was still on our site. Pretty fun for the kids to see. Actually the joke was on the bear, cause the hotdogs that were in the cooler were made by Maple Leaf!  Anyways, Arrowhead is a great park. There are nice scenic lookouts, trails and a nice calm river to paddle. The fishing was excellent. Lots of small mouth. We watched a lady catch a 3lber off the dock. If you ever go, paddle accross the lake directly from the canoe rental to the brich trees.  There you'll catch a fish every cast.  Although I prefer the walk in sites at Silent Lake for camping, we'll probably go back to Arrowhead again. The sites were very well maintained, lots of wildlife (bears, deer, beaver, otters,)and it is very scenic up there.  Cheers!"

243962,johnnyb,2008-08-27 20:25:00,3413,Never knew that Arrowhead had decent fishing...only been x-country skiing in there in the winter...thanks for the post!
243983,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-27 21:04:00,0,Great report on Arrowhead. Sounds like a decent place(other than the bears).
243999,Wild,2008-08-27 22:01:00,704,"If the bear does get sick let me know, one of the ML managers lives right across the street. Haven't seen him around much though"
244016,Musky or Specks,2008-08-27 23:41:00,2710,I use to spend two weeks camping there every summer with my family. The bass fishing has always been awesome.
