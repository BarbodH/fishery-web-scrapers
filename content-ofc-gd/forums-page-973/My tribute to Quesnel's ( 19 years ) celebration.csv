243908,keram,2008-08-27 18:03:00,585,"O.K. I do not know if it is just coincidence, or just plain luck , but when I've posted picture in gallery for my next post, I've noticed this extraordinary occasion to pay my tribute to the BOSS So here it is, the fishing lure TJQ 5 3/4.  I'm not too original with the name, so I've followed the Rapala's scheme ( like HS 11) So how it has started?. Well I've had one piece of wood turned on the lathe, that for some reason did not want to swim how I've liked. For a future reference I will call this piece of wood just ""pathetic""  After few weeks of playing with it, I've come to conclusion that I've built another fancy looking piece of firewood  . But , I'm not easily discouraged I've decided to rework it again and ended up with this.  Pencil Popper, I do not know who's invented the name , but I think it is perfect.  Now back to the name, the 5 3/4 comes from very complicated formula. You can see a belly treble hook ( under the skirt )   in the picture. Whatever size of the treble I've used ( and applied the formula - secret anyway)  I've come to the range of 5 1/2"" - 5 3/4"". Being a polite member of OFC I've went with 5 3/4"".  So here it is TJQ 5 3/4""  Disclaimer: Any resemblance to previously posted pictures is incidental and obviously unintentional "

243919,maybe,2008-08-27 18:43:00,307,"In order to properly appreciate keram's work, I believe we do need to see that picture.  Please?"
243920,keram,2008-08-27 18:46:00,585, I've never intended to question how tall you are  It is not about your height It is about belly hook size
243923,Bly,2008-08-27 19:08:00,1556,ROFL!!!!     :thumbsup_anim:  Too funny!!   I too thought instantly of the Tutu and wondered why the lure wasn't pink!!!

243933,keram,2008-08-27 19:38:00,585," I was not thinking abaut multiplying them  , but You've gave some idea. I've just searched my garage stock pile of other ""pathetic"" wood and came up with two pieces of it. I will build some more, like MQ,.....?   ( name suggestion appreciated) and  T(rex)Roy 4 1/2 I think I will make them available as a set  for the auction ( Fishing for Tyler)"
