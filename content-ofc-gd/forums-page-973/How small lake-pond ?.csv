243563,Rombo,2008-08-26 16:28:00,39,"I am wondering if anyone can give me some insight to how small a lake or pond can hold largies. I have many little lakes that are accessible from my cottage, but i am wondering at what point is in not worth hauling the canoe back in the bush. Will a 300 meter by 100 meter pond have any good fish.   Also i know largemouth can live in quite warm water but what would the shallow limit be ?"
243569,Mike Pike,2008-08-26 16:34:00,1332,Only way to truly find out if it has bass is to fish it.  I was at a friend's farm and he has a real tiny pond with some huge largies in it.  Not sure how they got there but they seem to be doing quite well.  Now I think no pond can be to small.
243572,Zib,2008-08-26 16:38:00,369,"Small ponds can hold some decent size LM. My wife's uncle has a 1/2 acre pond loaded with bluegills & LM. Most of the LM are small but I've caught them up to 18"" in there. The deepest spot in his pond is 12 feet (after the spring rains)."
243573,Victor,2008-08-26 16:40:00,1609,300m x 100m can hold'em for sure.  i've fished at one where it's approx. 40m x 70m. Only caught the dinky ones but I did spot one at around 3lbs.
243574,bbog,2008-08-26 16:40:00,665,"I think you might be surprised at what a ""pond"" that size might hold. This environment is made for hauling the canoe in.  Good luck in your hunt and don't tell anyone when you find the perfect bass hole."
243577,jediangler,2008-08-26 16:48:00,1923,Best thing about a small pond is people with big boats can't fish it. Less pressure means bigger fish.
243588,ccmtcanada,2008-08-26 17:16:00,7971,Ponds are underestimated for the fish they can hold.  Go for it...at least you'll have a nice adventure....with the payoff being some undisturbed bass!
243596,Rombo,2008-08-26 17:37:00,39,"Well I guess I will give it a try this weekend. There are a few good sized back lakes that I fish but everyone around knows about them, but the smaller ones seem untouched"
243606,cranks bait,2008-08-26 18:09:00,721,"We have a pond/swamp here called stump lake.  In the winter, many years ago,  they went out and clear cutted the area.  All that remains are millions of tree stumps (hence the name).  The deepest section is 3 feet.   we'll scoot around in a 12 foot glass boat powered by a 55 transom mount electric, bouncing off stumps like mad .  The fish also hit like mad.  Not something I would want to do everyday, but it sure does make for a fun evening of being a kid!!!"
243609,Rombo,2008-08-26 18:23:00,39,There is one I have in mind that Has alot of stumps in it but I have only ever seen it in the winter so i have no idea how deep it is
243616,cranks bait,2008-08-26 18:38:00,721, Big tip.  WEEDLESS hooks and lot's of them.
243619,Rombo,2008-08-26 18:47:00,39,"oooohhhh I know, I'm always buy more weedless hooks than anything else. One of my best producers this year has been a senko wacky style with a weedless hook."
243628,johnnyb,2008-08-26 19:25:00,3413,You should definitely be trying these places out...even a pre-fish from shore in the evening or morning might give you the proof you need to come back with the canoe.  We eagerly await your report!!!!
243650,Uncle Buck,2008-08-26 20:22:00,1000,"sounds cheesy, but throw out a bobber and a worm...  small ponds typically work best with live bait..."
243742,Rombo,2008-08-27 02:09:00,39,"Ok I will give a report, But plans may have changed for the weekend may be camping on another back lake with a few buddies. Now that lake produces you have 1.5 - 2 lb largie in under a minute, they are also the blackest bass I have ever seen"
243749,Rattletrap2,2008-08-27 02:26:00,1652,"As far as depth goes, as long as the water does not freeze solid to the bottom in the deepest areas, you are good. Temperatures can vary quite a bit. They prefer warmer waters, but will do nicely in cool water as well. Size of fish will depend on number of Bass or other predators present, and available food quantities. It takes about 10 pounds of feed to produce 1 pound of weight gain in Bass.  The actual size of the water body in acres is pretty irrelevant. The factors above are more important. Oxygen levels also play an important roll.  Good luck and let us know how you do!"
243754,Cudz,2008-08-27 02:37:00,2652,"My buddy has a pond that is about 150 ft by 150 ft.  It was somehow stocked with largies 20 years ago Anyway, it doesn't really matter how they got there.  The pond is 12 ft deep at its deepest point and it still has a good population of bass.  There are some 3+ pound bass swimming around there."
243762,Mattones,2008-08-27 02:56:00,587,There is a pond and a swamp in my girlfriends back yard. the pond was stocked once a few years ago she said. Their workers all fished it out they said.  But I really wanna try it. No idea how deep it is thought. i do know there are leaches in there haha
243767,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-27 03:14:00,2585,"the candian record large mouth came froma  very small lake, i have seen 3 and 4 pounders myself caught in ponds 100x100.  as long as the ponds dont dry up there is fish in them!  Cheers!"
