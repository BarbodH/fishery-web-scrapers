Had the Grandsons (Les Boys) down on the dock last Wed before they headed back to the Big Smoke, The bite was ""ON"" as we fished off the docks at Bayview Resort.  Here's a couple of shots with a pretty big Rock Bass.  This is AJ and Grandad     This is Will and Grandad    We sure are having fun with the smaller fish as they bite a lot better than the walleyes....  Stay Tuned for the next Grandson's fishing in Mid Sept."
