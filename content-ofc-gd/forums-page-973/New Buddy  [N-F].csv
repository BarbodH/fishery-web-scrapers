244040,moparhawk,2008-08-28 01:26:00,146,of course you turned in your man card  when you picked that one ......right?
244042,e-z-out,2008-08-28 01:42:00,1052,They are the best at that age but when they get older they drive me crazy had one but he passed a few years back. One thing never feed him meat keep it simple dry food and he will last 15 years pluse. Max passed away after  13 years to cancer. They are smart little dogs.
244043,Greencoachdog,2008-08-28 01:47:00,8163,There ought to be a law against something being that cute Jack!
244046,Beans,2008-08-28 01:57:00,3339,"He'll look like a white Marvin as soon as he grows a 'stache...  Cute pup you got Jack,a real beauty...Congrats!"
244069,bigugli,2008-08-28 03:13:00,6138,Cute pup. Almost as cute as the fish thieving dog. 
244077,jediangler,2008-08-28 03:43:00,1923,Does that doggy lifejacket come with split rings to attach trebles to? Just wondering  .
244090,motv8tr,2008-08-28 06:22:00,2587,"Very cute Jack, almost got my mom a Bichon years ago. but they ended up with Riley instead.  He'll keep ya's young that's for sure  Enjoy!!!  Maureen"
244098,crappieperchhunter,2008-08-28 10:00:00,2582,"Everytime my folks get a new dog they say this will be the last one. Can't tell you how many times that cycle has repeated itself. I think pets...dog's especially...keep you young. You don't get the ""Mans best friend""  tag for nothing. September 12 is shaping up to be a fine day!!! I wish you many happy memories with the newest family member."
244103,steve_paul,2008-08-28 10:38:00,658,"Cute little fella Jack.  We have 2 of them here and though they are small, they have a ton of personality and keep us hopping.  Enjoy."
244119,bigugli,2008-08-28 11:47:00,6138,"I've thought about it, but the dog is much friendlier than the offspring Besides, who else will quietly listen to my grumbling all day."

244331,bigugli,2008-08-28 22:34:00,6138,"They are cute and they will tug at the old heart strings. I'm sure you will love the puppy to pieces. I'm typing this with the fish thief, peanut, under my chair, and the daughter's kitten sitting om my chest, chewing my buttons and poking at my free typing arm"
