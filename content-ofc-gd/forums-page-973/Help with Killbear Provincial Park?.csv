243514,Victor,2008-08-26 13:42:00,1609,"Hi everyone,  Got a family camping trip planned this coming long weekend up at Killbear PP. Does anyone have experience fishing that area from a boat? I did a search on here and on google as well ... didn't find much. One of our members did go there earlier this month but it seems that most who has commented were shore-bound. Many said that the fishing around the park isn't that good ... does anyone know of a near-by lake with a boat launch I should try?  O yeah, I'll be targetting Bass/walleye/pike/muskie. Thanks in advance!  Victor"

243955,ravinerat,2008-08-27 20:09:00,64,You can launch at Kilbear Park. While sitting on the beach we see a bunch of boats (usually with riggers on) heading north past the park from Parry Sound. They all seem to be heading in the same general direction.  RR
