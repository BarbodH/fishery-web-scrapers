PXE Error - check your cables ... well after a long sleepless night and much farting about with SATA drivers and Gateway drivers .... and a wayyyyy cool tool called disk commander... I now have a laptop with a bright fancy new harddrive ... and few of things (like this favourite to OFC) to show for it ... I know .. I know ... thats what backups are for ... but ... lets just say it didnt work the way I thought it would  I am not quite there yet ... still missing a few months of emails and a favourites file .. and need to try and remember what fancy software I downloaded off the net  (like PDF readers/unlockers, screen grabbers etc)..   But wait .... this is a fishing site ..... nobody cares about alll that techy stuff !   Let me get a good nights sleeep and I'll see if I can upload a few pics from the ZEC"
