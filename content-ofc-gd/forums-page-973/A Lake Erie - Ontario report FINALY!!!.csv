243848,LeXXington,2008-08-27 14:43:00,1928,"Well after lots of stuff going on this summer and the weather not helping me I finally got out fishing.  First stop was Lake O for some Salmon action, lots of hooks but very little action it was just one of those days, but oooohhh to be on the water,. Dog was in heaven again  Around 10:am I decided to change up the baits again too see if it makes a difference and this was attached to the fly, swimming behind the boat for no idea how long I normaly change up every 30 min so somewhere between it hit and was swimming with us    Then a weekend of family stuff again then off too lake Erie for some Walleye action,  I headed out around 6:30 pm just too see if I could pick one up as the lake looked just a little bumpy  It was none stop, from the time I got too the right depth till the sun set and I came in, WOW is all I can say. I lost about 4 as they were missing the hook or while reeling them in they got off.  I did manage 2 in the boat.    Then Tuesday am, was out again, It was typical lake Erie calm close to shore, 4 foot rollers out..  Winds were too be 10k,  after about 2 hours I figured 25k then the coast guard said wind warning LOL.. Poor dog was green   I did manage 1 and lost a few unfortunately this one had some ugly growth and I know you can cut it out and eat but I figured the little guy had gone this long with it so over the side he/she went   All in All it was so nice to get out and report something ANYTHING..."
