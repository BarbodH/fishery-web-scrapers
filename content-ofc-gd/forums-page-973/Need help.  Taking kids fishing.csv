233282,super dave,2008-07-27 12:32:00,323,I have my 6 and 9 year old nephews visiting me and they wanted to go fishing for a couple of hours.  any place close to the pickering area where they can easily catch some panfish and possibly a bigger one?   Don't want to go too far.  maybe 30 mins or so. Thanks!

244257,GBW,2008-08-28 18:04:00,8460,The Causeway on 7a can be a bit dangerous with kids but worth a try for some perch.  There are a few parks along Water St that is just off 7a.  I see people there all the time I go by but there may be better places from some of the locals...
