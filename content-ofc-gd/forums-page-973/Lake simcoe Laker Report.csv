243144,rhare,2008-08-25 10:45:00,387,Well I spent the weekend dragging my balls around Lake simcoe before you get the wrong idea I ment cannonballs. I hit the lake friday with a friend who has been doing very well for lakers in the summer on simcoe. He gave me a few tips and I was ready to try it myself on the weekend.  The laker bite can be tough in Simcoe during the summer. I had tried pulling Nk's around with no results despite tons of marks on the finder. This weekend we decided to try my friends technique of bouncing bottom with the riggers. what a difference.  Saturday we went 5/5 and sunday we went 7/11  taping the flutter spoons seemed to make the difference. fish went from 3-8lbs some fought very well even peeling some line. only snapped a few pics as we released a bunch at the boat no to do any more damage.
