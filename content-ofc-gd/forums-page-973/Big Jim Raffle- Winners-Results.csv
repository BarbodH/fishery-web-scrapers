There are too many to mention and I would hate to forget anyone so we'll just extend a hugh thank you to all those who stepped up and made this raffle the success that it was.  All donors will be acknowledged on the Muskies Canada web-site at      www.MuskiesCanada.ca  I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say it's the least we can do for someone who has given so much to our sport and our communities, and we wish Jim all the very best in his continuing fight.  Secondly Muskies Canada would like to extend our appreciation and gratitude to all who bought tickets in order to support Big Jim. You all stepped up big time and all deserve a HUGH THANK YOU  We had to pick six tickets but I believe you are all winners for the support you all showed.  It was because of you that we are able to present Big Jim with a cheque to help with his treatment in the sum of  $15,000.00   As you know the draw was held last night at the legion in Ottawa and we are happy to congratulate our 6 winners.....  Our six winners are....  Charter and prize winners   Doug Buckland  from Perth Ont.  Connie Lachapelle from Sudbury Ont.  Robert Dick from Ottawa Ont.  Ben McAllister...City not given.  Daniel Vidal from Arnprior   Pinecrest Lodge stay  Loic Tronel from St.Sauveur QC.  Once again folks thanks for supporting this great cause.  On behalf of Muskies Canada  Sincerely  Matt Clay"

239903,Crazyhook,2008-08-15 02:23:00,1154,"To Matt and everyone involved at MCI, so nice of everybody to give back to someone who has done so much for the sport. Jim is such a great person and I am sure that knowing there are so many people that care for him will give him the strength I know he has. He has made for many kids ( of all ages) smile and appreciate the sport of fishing.  Thoughts are with you big guy... you are still in my spot!"
239938,BIG JIM,2008-08-15 09:11:00,11,"Hey Guy's and Gal's, just wanted to take a moment here to offer a pile of thanks to Matt and Jim, MC, and everyone else who helped out or bought tickets.  You never think you will need help along the way and as RJ said on one of the boards ""this is very humbling for me"" and for the reason that it was offered not asked for...means even more!!! and makes it very special forever.  This is the first time in over 20 years that I was confused about my future and what would really happen.  An event like this is helping to secure the future so I can get this poop out of my body.  I just spent the most horrible five days of my life by far with this experimental chemo, but it seems to have let up just a bit here in the last half day.  Hopefully I will get out on the St. Lawrence for a boat ride this Sunday with Mr. Robert Izumi who offered to pick me up for a couple hours    as he practises for the FLW STREN event on the big river...what a guy!!!    ( nearly four months since I was in a boat)  Thank-you  Thank-you Thank-you to all  BIG JIM"
239940,Rich Clemens,2008-08-15 10:20:00,3131,Man o man ... That is fantastic.   We'll be sure to continue to keep Big Jim in our prayers.

There is a letter in the mail to you, that will give you the contact information for your prize package at Pinecrest.  I would ask your indulgence for a few days - at least long enough for Canada Post to get the information to you.  In the meantime, please feel free to give me a call - Andree will be happy to give you my number  Chris Purdy President Muskies Canada Inc"
