244008,Lakeshore,2008-08-27 23:10:00,56,"I had a chance to fish with a good friend today.  We launched from Port Maitland this morning at 7 am. Since i am not that familiar (newbie) concerning Lake Erie, I decided to take the suggestions of owner of the boat and go to spot that had been productive before. We headed out from Port and went out to a location near or around the ""Gas Wells"", probably familiar to some of you (White posts floating out several; miles from shore). I'll try to do my best with the details.  80 FOW, 35-50FT down, 2 riggers, 175', and 200' back from ball.  Worm harnesses, double bladed, copper color and rainbow pattern. 2 rods, lead core, out to an approximate depth of 32-37'. Today the wind was out of the west, some swells, 2-4 ft deep.  I am usually very good on boats, but today got real ""sea sick"", lasted four hours on chips and water. Didn't get a single bite, nothing, nada, zip, zilch. Did I do something wrong???  I would appreciate feedback.  I know that everyone gets skunked sooner or later, but I just want to make sure that I didn't make a rookie mistake, and could have saved a good day.     Just some pics of the water and weather conditions"

244059,Carp,2008-08-28 02:44:00,1488,"I've done well with worm tipped spinners and small spoons. Out on a charter a couple of years ago. We caught 21 walleye in about 3 hours. Only 2 or 3 came off the riggers. The rest were on dipseys. The same green and orange spoon took more than half the fish, including 7 bows and about 20 - 25 sheepshead. 35 to 50 feet down was the magic depth, but that was @ the end of July. Don't be scared to kick the speed up a notch too. If you don't find a school of fish, it won't matter what you do."
244062,Fishmaster,2008-08-28 02:59:00,920,There is a ton of walleye off Port Maitland right now ...only out a few hours tonight and got some hogs ..full report coming soon .
