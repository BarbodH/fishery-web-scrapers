242926,Basskicker,2008-08-24 18:52:00,421,"I haven't been around for awhile, been real busy.....so I thought I share some of my adventure for the last month.  We left for Thunder Bay back on July 25 to get married on August 2, 2008 and had our honeymoon on Rainy lake near Fort Frances.  It was so exciting having 4 weeks off, getting married and going fishing for our honeymoon.  I took over 600 pictures so trying to choose which ones to post has been difficult.  Our first day was long with the drive to Wawa where we stayed the first night.  We pulled into Wawa around 2:00 A.M.......a piece of advice.  DO NOT leave the Sault St. Marie after dark....the drive to Wawa took over 3 hours and that stretch of road is dangerous at night due to moose.  Our place for the night...   The next day we reached Thunder Bay were Andrea's parents live on the beautiful shores of Lake Superior about 100 feet from the water...this is the view of the Sleeping Giant that I awoke to every day...   The next 7 days I spent with her family...but of course I had to sneak away for some fishing.  So off I went to explore with my van and canoe.  The first trip I decided to head out to the Nipigon River....when I got there I was overwhelmed by the shear beauty and raw power of her. Not willing to put my canoe in the river (suicide) in that location.....I decided to head back towards Thunder Bay and fish the Black Sturgeon river which I was told held some brookies......but all I got was walleye and smallmouth (all released).  Managed to catch a dozen of so fish.    I saw several deer near her parents house.....those buggers are quick...really difficult to photograph...seen over 15 deer and managed only 1 picture.....   A couple of days later I decided to head out to a smallmouth lake for the evening.  The fishing and scenery was unbelievable. In nearly 3 hours I caught and released from my canoe over 30 fish. Trying to take pictures of fish in a canoe is very difficult....but I managed a couple.  This was the average size.      Finally August 2, 2008 arrived.....the day of the wedding.  It was amazing....we got married in Rossport...a very small village (300 people) located south of Thunder Bay on the shores of Lake Superior.  The scenery was unbelievable.  Here's a video segment of the wedding done to our wedding song.   <object width=""400"" height=""302"">	<param name=""allowfullscreen"" value=""true"" />	<param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always"" />	<param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1593520&server=www.vimeo.com&show_title=0&show_byline=0&show_portrait=0&color=00adef&fullscreen=1""'>http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1593520&server=www.vimeo.com&show_title=0&show_byline=0&show_portrait=0&color=00adef&fullscreen=1"" />	<embed src=""http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1593520&server=www.vimeo.com&show_title=0&show_byline=0&show_portrait=0&color=00adef&fullscreen=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" width=""400"" height=""302""></embed></object><br /><a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/1593520?pg=embed&sec=1593520"">Untitled</a> from <a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/user513794?pg=embed&sec=1593520"">Jason Lovell</a> on <a href=""http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&sec=1593520"">Vimeo</a>.

243229,Basskicker,2008-08-25 14:28:00,421,"Thanks guys for all the kind comments.....as for the sand ceremony.  Since it was an outdoor wedding, it was our version of the unity candles.  She poured the white sand and I poured the black into the middle vase to symbolize our unity together.  The vase is now home with us on our fireplace mantle....how the helps to clear it up.  Hey Cliff....no little one's in the plans as of yet.  Jason"
