244151,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-28 12:48:00,957,In the old days 10% of fishermen caught 90% of the fish.  Now two guys seem to be catching all the big fish.  Nice job.  Those are beauts.

244037,Nemo,2008-08-28 01:08:00,727,Alright enough with the shenanigans...looks like that fish is trained. Lew must be like some kind of Musky Whisperer.  The fish hangs out in the same spot. Lew whistles and the thing jumps in the boat for a picture.  It's this kind of thing that gives fishermen a bad name....       ' ' ' ' ' ' ' LOL - Just Kidding  Great fish Misty glad your boyt got to see you guys in action. BTW can I borrow your horseshoe...
