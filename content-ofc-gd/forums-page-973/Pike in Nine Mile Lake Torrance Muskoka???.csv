243940,johnnyb,2008-08-27 19:47:00,3413,"Maybe someone has illegally released it in there?  For it to get that big naturally, there must be more than one...and pike being so aggressive, you think they'd be hard to not notice.  On the other hand, the lake my parents are on has always been a strictly bass/walleye lake...but every few years you hear of someone claiming they caught a pike in there.  ???"
244206,fishinggeek,2008-08-28 14:47:00,325,"Interesting.  Could fingerling pike may their way 10Km through swamp?  I've heard of pike doing some crazy moving, even into the ocean I believe.  I've also heard on this board how birds transport LMB eggs into small urban ponds.  Maybe that's a possibility here as well."
