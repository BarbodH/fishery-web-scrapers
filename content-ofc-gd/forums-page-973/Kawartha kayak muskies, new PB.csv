243786,singingdog,2008-08-27 10:18:00,1047, Definitly attach a rod holder: it is the single most important thing you can do to make any kayak a decent fishing platform. Check out the forums at http://www.yakfisher.net/ for pics of rigged boats. The most important thing I have found is to test paddle the boat with the rod holder in place before you drill holes for it. You often will need to mount it much further forward than you think.
243121,jediangler,2008-08-25 05:16:00,1923,"Returned to Camp Ashtabula on Pigeon lake for a second time this summer, this time with a plan to test drive a new kayak. Spoke to the crew at Wild Rock outfitters in Peterborough and they suggested a Necky Manitou Sport. The idea was that it would handle my 200lbs but be managable for my 8yr old daughter.  It measures out at 10'11"" long and weighs 44lbs. It has a sealed rear bulkhead and plenty of deck rigging in both bungee and nylon ropes. I attached a portable version of my hockey stick camera mount with tape to take pics if I caught anything photo worthy. I always use my own paddle on a test ride or rental, this way I can judge the performance of the boat alone.  My daughter gave the Manitou Sport 2 thumbs up for a comfortable seat and ease of paddling. I found it to be very fast for a rec yak, but because of my weight, I did get wet. Any waves hitting me broadside greater than a foot would break in my lap. I had the wife drive me up the lake 3km so I could paddle back and fish for perch and crappie with my ultra-lite.  This scrappy 24"" ski hit a 1/16oz jig & grub combo in 4ft of water. A nice little battle on a 5'5"" ugly-stik. Good thing I had 10lb Fireline on my reel as I had no leader.  Did some fishing in a rental 14' w/9.9hp with the wife and daughter as well. This perch was one of 21 fish she landed in a 1.5hr drift. She caught bluegill, sunfish, rockbass and perch with her pink & white tube on a 1/16oz jig. I had it on a stringer for her until she decided that she couldn't eat it because it was so cute.  My wife fished a 1/8oz jig and grub combo in white and caught several largies this size as well as loads of panfish.  This puppy was 43"" and hit a Mepps musky killer bucktail (gold blade w/black buck) in 12ft of water along a weedline. It went deep first, burying itself in the weeds, and wouldn't budge. I used the old guitar plunking the line on it and bolted out of the weeds and into deeper water. I was pulled maybe 25ft and then spun around once before it came to the surface so I could see it. Then it soaked me with it's tail a few times and spun me around again before I got a hand on it. It did manage to stick 2 teeth into my thumb while I was unhooking it, but it was very co-operative for the size and the pain was worth it. I took a measurement and a couple of photos before releasing it. It was my second longest ever and a new kayak PB. My adrenaline was pumping and I would have won an Olympic gold medal on my paddle back to the cottage to tell the story and show off my pics.  This was the first pic I took with the sun behind me, kinda cool with the rays all around me."
243123,Zubris21,2008-08-25 05:27:00,563,I can't imagine catching a muskie like that out of a small kayak.  Must have been quite the adrenaline rush!
243131,Jonaton,2008-08-25 06:51:00,72,"What a great fish to catch in a kayak, I think I am going to have to rent one one day as that just seems like too much fun."
243133,Cudz,2008-08-25 07:28:00,2652,"Wow.  Great fish, and from a kayak no less.  Well done."
243148,Pigeontroller,2008-08-25 11:02:00,2793,Nice one Jedi!
243152,danbo,2008-08-25 11:15:00,2646,Atta Boy!
243156,ccmtcanada,2008-08-25 11:37:00,7971,Great report!  Congrats on the PB Muskie in your yak....a great fish no matter how you catch it!  Looks like you all had a great time.  Gotta love it when the fish cooperates when you have your little one in the boat as well...her smile says it all.
243160,mattyk,2008-08-25 11:42:00,2110,"nice fish, congrats on the muskie!"
243172,ricoboxing,2008-08-25 12:06:00,398,hey thats a sweet yak muskie! who needs a motor when u got that thing to pull you around.
243177,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-08-25 12:12:00,1362,super lookin' Muskie....thanks for sharing!
243190,Bly,2008-08-25 12:54:00,1556,"Congrats, that is a nice fish and a great way to break in the new yak!"
243193,Leecher,2008-08-25 13:06:00,7832,Great report and pics jediangler  Congratulation on your PB     a real beaut!  Thanks for sharing Leechman
243201,Greencoachdog,2008-08-25 13:32:00,8163,Looks like a great family outing and a beauty Musky!!!
243204,1leggedangler,2008-08-25 13:39:00,364,"Nice Muskie!! Congrats on the PB, can't imagine trying to land that beast in a kayak, well done!!!  Cheers, 1leg"
243205,JohnF,2008-08-25 13:39:00,3494,"Sheesh! I could see me, sitting in the kayak, watching that behemoth tow me around as I screamed for help. I'd be hyperventilating with that monster if I caught him from the shoreline, let alone in a boat. In a kayak I'd be plain and simply screwed. I'd likely get very wet, in so many ways.  Good job  JF"
243209,tbayboy,2008-08-25 13:50:00,1497,"Very cool report Jedi, congrats on that beautiful musky."
243215,glen,2008-08-25 14:00:00,2641,Very nice looking fish.  WTG Jedi.
243228,johnnyb,2008-08-25 14:26:00,3413,"you know what?  you're crazy!!!    Excellent fish, REALLY impressive that you do it sitting in that Kayak...good job!!!"
243448,jediangler,2008-08-26 03:42:00,1923,"It certainly was a fun fish to catch in the kayak. I find it easier to hand land them out of the yak as opposed to using a cradle in an aluminum boat. Everyone seems to forget that the Innuit have been hunting whale, seal, walrus and narwal out of kayaks for centuries. Picture a guy with a harpooned Beluga whale holding the rope in his kayak in sub zero temps being towed around an ice flow. Now that's EXTREME kayaking. Kinda makes my musky insignificant. Next challenge, bring on the Chinooks"
243449,cram,2008-08-26 03:49:00,1733,I have a similar rec kayak and have tried fishing from it but would love to attach a rod holder for trolling.  Any recommendations on where to place one??
243450,yo_guy,2008-08-26 03:52:00,111,Bring a helmet and facemask protector just incase one of the bigger brutes jump on to lap and highjack your yak with trebles poking you. LOL
243482,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-26 12:20:00,0,Very impressive musky and from a kayak to boot! Congrats on your PB.I was headed for pigeon too but Emily was having reservation problems so went to Balsam. How was the wind on Pigeon with the kayak?? It was pretty bad on Balsam.
243504,joonmoon,2008-08-26 13:23:00,528,"Good one Bro. NICE. Holy cow nice perch too and some familiar looking spots where that bass was caught. Yas had a good week,looking forward to our Cherryhill gang weekend. Stopped in at Emily one day too but there was no way I could get our boat in without getting swamped, had to let it go for now. Bummer."
243511,b2kptbo,2008-08-26 13:37:00,1505,Great report and WOW it musta been fun landing that muskie...
