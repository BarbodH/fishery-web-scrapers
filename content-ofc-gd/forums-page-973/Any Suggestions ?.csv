We are sick of the same old and want to try a new place.   Does anyone know of any good lodges etc that have good rates, are pretty close to Toronto, offer great bass fishing and have boat rentals?  Somewhere a little quiet and not too populated would be best.     Thanks guys"
244259,GBW,2008-08-28 18:13:00,8460,How far do you want to go and in what direction?  There has been a lot of posts about places to go in a 3 hour or less drive.  have a look at some of the old posts as you may find what you are looking for.  Cheers.

244262,ADC,2008-08-28 18:26:00,82,"  Well,  Any direction within 2 - 3hrs is perfect as long as there are plenty of bass at the destination  Ive been searching and searching already to try and find old posts that will help but, its just too hard to find anything. So I made my own post cause I gave up. Ive been searching the net as well and its just so populated I keep going in circles.  I was hoping someone could mention a place they have been to that has the bass, cabin and boat rental for a fair price. This way, I get a first hand review and will know what to expect.  This is what I love about this forum, you get honest first hand info.  cheers"
244292,GBW,2008-08-28 19:42:00,8460,"have a quick search on this board for ""Halimar"" and you will see what my thoughts are.  The do rent a boat there but if you are ok in a canoe then those are free.  Have a look, I've even posted 2 fish I got there this year... Oh and it's on a great chain of lakes too..."
