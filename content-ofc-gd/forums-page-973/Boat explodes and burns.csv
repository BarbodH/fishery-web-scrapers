243486,danc,2008-08-26 12:47:00,4677,"A boat that a local man was fishing in exploded and burned last weekend, less than a mile from my house.  Read more about it HERE  "
243487,BillM,2008-08-26 12:48:00,17367,Reminds me of Jaws.
243488,Roy,2008-08-26 12:52:00,13728,Scary stuff Dan. I wonder what caused that?
243489,e-z-out,2008-08-26 12:55:00,1052,Thats one lucky guy to not have been killed.
243490,Lakeshore,2008-08-26 12:57:00,56,"Wow, lucky to be alive that's for sure."
243492,John,2008-08-26 12:57:00,2956,"Sounds like gasoline fumes igniting to me, starting the inboard without turning the blower on?"
243493,Greencoachdog,2008-08-26 13:03:00,8163,I guess the fire extinguisher wasn't of any use.
243535,Garyv,2008-08-26 14:47:00,547,Probably a simple case of trying to prevent one thing from happening without giving thought to what could happen without using the blower to clear the engine compartment.  Trolling with a kicker the has the ability to provide enough pressure ( air force ) to not allow the vents from the engine compartment to let fumes escape. I would be willing to bet that's what happened.  Guy is lucky to be alive and / or not burned.
243549,Joey,2008-08-26 15:30:00,9122,"Wow, that is scary.  Just goes to show you that you should always wear your life jacket (like I'm one to talk).  Thanks for sharing that Dan.  Joey"
243570,Bernie,2008-08-26 16:35:00,3190,Being around boats all my life that's not the first time to see that. Fumes in the engine compartment is the usual cause. Also seen guys cheap out on using the wrong parts too. Using a car alternator in place of a shielded I/O alternator is a good example. When the fumes explode there is no time for an extinguisher. Good reminder for us all Dan!
243575,canadadude,2008-08-26 16:43:00,769,"I agree I've seen many a guy using car parts on there I/O engines instead of using marine grade parts. I always leave the blower going from the time I get on board, better safe then sorry"
243614,douG,2008-08-26 18:34:00,2693,That'll buff right out there.
243630,johnnyb,2008-08-26 19:29:00,3413,"Speedometer, signalling devices, running lights...none of them function.  But the radio comes through clear as bell!  Seriously, that guy is lucky to be alive...WOW!"

243716,tjsa,2008-08-27 00:34:00,1578,"Yeah, read that yesterday, saw the pictures. Glad he is OK. Too bad about his boat though."
243718,forrest,2008-08-27 00:38:00,1032,  If you read the article the first explosion happened after he bent over and flipped the ignition.  It is obvious that gas released from an earlier meal caused the initial explosion that then ruptured the boats gas tank and blew it up.
243744,scuro,2008-08-27 02:11:00,386,See what happens when you freebase.
243909,POLLIWOGG,2008-08-27 18:05:00,835,"When the salmon fishing was hot and everybody started getting into it, almost every hot Sunday somebody would blow up a boat and the news would work its way down the lake on the radio."
