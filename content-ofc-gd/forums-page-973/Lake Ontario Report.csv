243790,Carp,2008-08-27 11:03:00,1488,"I was out on the big lake for some salmon and trout this past weekend. Fishing was slow, but I did catch a couple of decent fish and a few smaller ones. A very nice bow @ 33.25 inches and a decent chinook @ 34.75 inches. The bow took off like a bullet, but the chinny was a bleeder and my neighbor asked for one, so it came home. I should be able to get out a few more times in the next couple of weeks. Hope I'll have something else worth posting.  Rainbow trout.   Chinook salmon "
