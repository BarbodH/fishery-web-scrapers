243965,GBW,2008-08-27 20:36:00,8460,There are many shore spots in your area.  What do you want to fish for?  Try the bluff's if you want to.

I am not familiar with the Scarborough area but Frenchmen's Bay in Pickering can be a good place.  The Bay has produced nice pike, carp and bass that I know of.   Also, any of the East piers should be starting to see the Salmon run."
244039,BigGuppy,2008-08-28 01:21:00,19,Hi Thanks for the replies. Something came up and couldn't go. Would it be too late to go down to the rouge in the next half hour and do some fishing. Has anyone fished nights there before?
