Friday was just beautiful had a great time walking around town checking out the shops and doing a little bit of gear shopping behind the wifes back. No fishing friday had to wait till 12am May 17th since thats when fishing opens in lower Buckhorn. Well i started fishing from 12am till 3am and man was the bite on with in 40min of haveing the line wet i had already landed 28 big fat crappie. At this point i forgot the camara was having way to much fun. Well around 2:40am i was about to call it quits when out of no wear i felt a hard hit. I knew it had to bigger then a crappie and low and behold i pulled out a 24"" Walleye. All this time i had been fishing just from the dock and it had been a great nite. I was useing a C8025MGX Pflueger Supreme Spinning reel along with the power pro 5 pound braided line and Shakespeare Ugly Stick Lite Graphite rod nice little set-up for under $175.  Well when i did remember the camara it was just about to clean my catch from my 6am fishing trip the fallowing day.                            "

204296,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-21 13:59:00,0,Thanks for the report. No wonder I never catch crappie in Buckhorn. They bite at night! It could also be those musky lures I use.
