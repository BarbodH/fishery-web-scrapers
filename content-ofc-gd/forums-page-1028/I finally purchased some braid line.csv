204084,Raf,2008-05-21 00:34:00,3495,"yes, i am aware of that gerritt.  it's two years old though!  it is real simple to lay blame on faulty line."
204088,Stoty,2008-05-21 00:37:00,2910,"The line broke in the middle of the cast...no backlash at all. I just threw it and SNAP.....spinnerbait gone! Happened the very next cast too. I found a nice kink in the line down deep in the spool on the reel. I am assuming that the ""line slip"" happened like it tends to do with PowerPro. I stripped all the line off, and dipped it into my kitchen sink, then spooled the bottom of my reel with 6 lb mono, uni knotted that to my PP, and am now finishing off the spool with flouro.  Hopefully this will solve my issue.  I emailed the company and they are sending me a free spool for my bad experience. Very classy and professional! I am hoping to get out again this weekend, so we will see if the same thing happens.  FYI: - wasnt a knock off line - it was 20 lb with 6 lb diameter - lures I was using were typical 1/4 oz spinnerbaits."
204093,Raf,2008-05-21 00:41:00,3495,"well, crow is tasting good.  nice to hear they are taking care of you though!  my 0.02c, not sure what kind of a setup you are running but i wouldn't go lower than 30lb for a baitcaster."
204125,muskymike,2008-05-21 01:40:00,772," When trying to cast an OOS bass on 8# test for bait, no wonder. Who are you trying to fool Stoty?  I use 80# and 100# for Musky and have never had a break off casting large lures including hours with the ""Pounder"" Bulldawg.  I agree with Bill, USER ERROR"
204151,Guest buick14,2008-05-21 02:28:00,0,"stoty: I have experienced the same problem with the same company of braid................I really do beleive it snaps a lot easier if you hit a not midway, and I agree I think it may have something to do with the low stretch lack of shock type deal............I am not an expert when it comes to fluorocarbons and braids myself though....  I personally like the good old trilene sensation or XT for the shields lakes and rocks etc. they have never let me down! On the other hand, I started using P-Line  evolution and CXX and has been equally as good if not a touch better so far......  anybody try the new berkley flurocarbon for like $19+ per 200yd spool ?? Is it good stuff .........?"
204156,Stoty,2008-05-21 02:38:00,2910, And the point of this post was...? Casting an OOS bass on 8lb test??? I dont recall saying anything about bass or 8 lb test...
204158,muskymike,2008-05-21 02:39:00,772,jeez lost your sense of humor too fast stoty.
204199,jace,2008-05-21 07:53:00,472,"didn't read the links but i know for a fact that braid will cut up some modern guides if you fish them hard enough...which is why a lot of people have switched to specific types to avoid it.     The titanium nickel wire RECoil guides will groove with heavy use but that's the price of having near weightless guides.    RECoils are the guides found on some higher end factory GLoomis rods, both spinning and casting.   and flyrods"
204200,jace,2008-05-21 08:00:00,472,"If you're not getting tangled anywhere, I'm willing to bet your line release jolts the rod and/or lure.  i.e. not a smooth casting motion.   As everybody has said, there's next to no stretch in this line so a very hard and  sharp jolt will snap it.   There are also some knots not recommended for these lines because they cut into themselves and basically cuts itself off at the knot after continuous tightening."
204230,Vanselena,2008-05-21 11:20:00,269,Josh at Angling Outfitters was talking about this same problem with Power Pro. He seems to think something changed with PP braid and recommended other braids. This guy sells more line then anyone I know so perhaps there is more to Stoty's story then user error.
204254,Stoty,2008-05-21 12:25:00,2910,"Thanks Vanselena. It wasnt a user error, I know what I am doing out on the water.  Again.....the line didnt break at the knot......I know this because I retrieved the 3rd bait that snapped, because there was about 25 ft of line floating in the water, which I grabbed that had my bait tied to it.  I use the palmar knot, and moisten it when I tie it. I have done everything by the book, but still have this problem.  Like I said before, hopefully the ""mono-backing"" on the reel, and the wet spooling of the line will fix the problem."
204257,BillM,2008-05-21 12:29:00,17367,Perhaps it was a glitch in the Matrix?
204275,douG,2008-05-21 13:03:00,2693,"Mono backing is useful only if you are afraid of putting a piece of tape around the arbor knot tying your braid to the spool.  This will stop the whole business slipping against the spool as you retrieve.  I troll with long lines and like the braid to go all the way to the spool.  As others said, you need the Palomar knot or uni knot to tie your line to a swivel or hook eye, and the uni uni knot to tie on a leader of fluoro."
204278,Stoty,2008-05-21 13:17:00,2910,Which is exactly what I did last night. Lets hope that fixes my problem.
204281,muskymike,2008-05-21 13:24:00,772, hahahaha
204282,muskymike,2008-05-21 13:25:00,772," Come on now Stoty, Bill and I were just picking on you. We both know it wasnt user error. We are just pushin your buttons. Thats all."
203834,MuddyWater,2008-05-20 18:43:00,218,i picked up some spider wire teflon coated stuff the 6lb and spooled that on. one thing i noticed is tying a knot its annoing and i had to improvise some crazy knot that i dont trust to much lol. so i was wondering about what knot is best for braid. also it makes a weird sound when pulling through the eyes of my rod will it burn or groove my rod? anyways anything that can go bad would be good to know. peace
203838,ccmtcanada,2008-05-20 18:46:00,7971,Use the Palomar Knot....  http://www.animatedknots.com/palomar/index.php
203841,Raf,2008-05-20 18:51:00,3495,i'd recommend learning the uni knot and it's variations (ie uni to uni for joining lines)  the noise is fine.
203842,snag,2008-05-20 18:51:00,1932,"I use a uni knot.  Beware, it will cut you!"
203852,aplumma,2008-05-20 19:03:00,6896,I have been using braid for about 6 years now and it is a great product for what it can do. First of all remember that you have no stretch to it so slow down and use less force when setting the hook. If you do get snagged and wrap it around your hand to pop the line you will usually slice into your hand expecially if they are wet or if it is in a groove of your finger. Their is a suppliment in the spool of braid that gives you a few knots to use I can tie them but do not remember the names. Braid tends to get fuzzy as it is abraided against rocks and things a fuzzy line is a weak line so cut off a few feet just as you do with mono. You may find that if the water is very clear the fish can see the line some people use a mono or flourocarbon leader when the fish are nervous. If you are using a baitcaster and you are still getting birdnests in the mono you will have even a harder time getting the backlash out of the braid. I wont go into the upside of the braid because you have already found out that you like it and as you get comfortable with it you might someday go with it in all of your fishing adventures like I have.

203854,BillM,2008-05-20 19:05:00,17367,"Once you have filled the spool, make sure to let all the line out of the reel and reel it back in wet. (We used a small spoon and a quick 30 second romp of the motor to get all the line in the water)  If not, there is a good chance you'll end up having the line slip on the spool (Happened to my oldman this weekend)"
203861,Reef Runner,2008-05-20 19:16:00,981,"Mono backing on the spool.  Uni to uni knot (make sure line diameter is the same or you'll have problems).  Palomar kbnow to tie on leaders, lures.  reefrunner"
203864,GBW,2008-05-20 19:21:00,8460,"do you have any Mono backing on the spool?  if not, you need to have a backing of mono before the braided line and a double unit knot is best I find to join the 2 lines together... "
203867,MuddyWater,2008-05-20 19:22:00,218,yea i forgot about the backing part since its 1lb dia. and my reel is only half full  ill have to get the line counter out and spool up some backing. im going to use a 8lb floro leader for all my fishing (im a nut about line visibility) Another thing i would like to know can pike and musky cut braid easily? i tried biting off a peice and it took a good amount of chomping!!
203870,GBW,2008-05-20 19:26:00,8460,I don't know about you but my teeth are nothing like a pike's...  HAHA yes they can to answer your question.  Not at all like mono though.  if you are fishing for fish with big teeth then maybe you want a Titanium Leader Wire about 30 LB or so...
203874,MuddyWater,2008-05-20 19:32:00,218,i rarely fish for pike i just catch them when im casting my nice new rapala for walleye and the pike steal it lol. then i shake my fist at the water and tie on another 10 bucks...
203878,GBW,2008-05-20 19:38:00,8460,"see, i find that when you tie on cold hard cash I don't get any fish, just my wife wondering what the hell i'm up to..."
203881,Reef Runner,2008-05-20 19:42:00,981,"If there are alot of pike in the area, definately use a leader.  You won't be shaking your fist at the water as much.  Lotsa guys tie their own floros, expensive at the store.  A good black wire or titanium should do ya."
203882,Stoty,2008-05-20 19:43:00,2910,Stay away from PowerPro! Just lost $20 worth of lures because the line broke on the cast(s)!
203885,BillM,2008-05-20 19:50:00,17367,  User error?
203887,Stoty,2008-05-20 19:52:00,2910, If making a cast while fishing is a User error....then guilty as charged.  (Line didnt break at the knot)
204010,Garry2Rs,2008-05-20 22:44:00,1425,I had the same problem with Spiderwire's Invisabraid in 30 pound test. I e-mailed the company and they asked me to mail it to them. Last week I received a replacement spool...I will see what happens. What pound test were you using?  What size lures were you throwing?
204017,MuddyWater,2008-05-20 22:54:00,218,i read something that braid has little stretch which means if you cast it hard and crazy like and you hit a knot or something it can snap it super easy because of the line shock or something
204030,BillM,2008-05-20 23:15:00,17367,Only time I have ever had braid snap is when it's been tangled around one of the eyelets before casting.  Braid just doesn't snap for no reason...
204031,ccmtcanada,2008-05-20 23:17:00,7971,I use 20 and 30 lb power pro....and I have never had a problem.
204042,forrest,2008-05-20 23:35:00,1032, I have been told that eyelets that are not durable or built for the braid will cut. Maybe someone else can give better info on this.  forrest
204052,Gerritt,2008-05-20 23:52:00,6129,  Sounds like you bought some counterfeit line.. PowerPro has a problem with cheap knock offs hitting the market with less the a superior product... see the power pro website for details.  G
204055,ccmtcanada,2008-05-20 23:54:00,7971, I heard the same thing from my local tackle shop....he suggested using at least 30lb power pro.  He said that 20lb is really thin and can groove the eyes.
204069,Gerritt,2008-05-21 00:07:00,6129,"  10X STRONGER THAN STEEL  But what about...?  Older, first-generation superlines were made of abrasive aramids that could cut rod guides and take a toll on equipment. PowerPro solves these problems through super slick, non-abrasive Spectra Fiber composition and unique EBT processing. Other complaints about superlines arose simply because the technology was so new, and few people knew how to take proper advantage of it. The Using PowerPro quick guide takes the mystery out of using a superline and guarantees a satisfying fishing experience from the first cast!  I have powerpro on alot of my reels and have used it for a couple years now.. never one instance of this..  That said Quality Rods = Quality Guides.  G"
204072,Raf,2008-05-21 00:12:00,3495,i think you guys are jumping to conclusions without knowing what happened re: stoty.  how exactly did the line break on the casts?  a backlash?
