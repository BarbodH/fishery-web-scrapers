204376,Basskicker,2008-05-21 17:56:00,421,I have 3 batteries in total  2-Optimas- Blue Top Dual Purpose 34DC-for Trolling Motor Only Using Bass Pro Shops 2 Bank 10/10 as per diagram 1-Nautilus Deep Cycle-for everything else...NOT hooked up to on-board charger-25HP main motor charges battery  Jason  Gonna call BPS right now....
204384,Basskicker,2008-05-21 18:09:00,421,"I just spoke with a gentleman at BPS and he told me that there was a switch on the outside of the charger that held a small magnet. This has to be removed in order to charge AGM style (Optima) batteries.  Well when I get back from my fishing trip, it the first thing I'll try.  Thanks once again for everyone's help.  Jason"
204408,Terry,2008-05-21 19:25:00,14456,"ok, by your diagram you only have one battery hooked  your trolling motor not 2"
204274,legacey,2008-05-21 13:01:00,127,"I had this same problem 2 weeks ago, with a BPS 3 bank charger. I had a local marine company install it for me along wtih a new trolling motor. I'm pretty much stupid with these things but now realize, so was the marine company.  For 2 weekends in a row, when charging, only the lights that you indicated displayed.  The problem, as you've all indicated, is that the battery it was getting it's load read (charge) wasn't being used by the trolling motor so would always indicate it was ready or ""go fish"".  Once it was reconnected, I finally got the ""charge"" light to display.  I'm sorry I can't tell you what is incorrect but BPS will more than likely say the same.  Good luck."
204287,Basskicker,2008-05-21 13:43:00,421," Sorry for my ignorance....but what exactly do you mean by ""Once it was reconnected, I finally got the ""charge"" light to display"" Thanks Jason  That's is exactly the same situation that I am facing."
204346,bucktail,2008-05-21 16:13:00,1857,"    LUnd boy!! T  Thanks a million for the info, i just got 2 optima's and got less than a days fishng out of them because I used my minnkota onboard.  I was worried that something was wrong, I will use my other charger on them till I get a new onboard.  This explains alot!   Tjhanks   darren"
204369,legacey,2008-05-21 17:28:00,127,"Sorry Bass Kicker.  I had a friend drop by and when he looked at it, the only battery that was being read was the main battery; not at all the 2 aux batteries. It took him less than 5 minutes to re-connect everything that the marine place tried to charge me $75 to do.  A wire was not connected so the charge never did work on the other 2 and my main batter was fully charged.  Otherwise, only the power, float and go fish indicator displayed. The only time too, I would see the charge light go on was when I was starting up the motor (main) and only for a brief second, when the charger was connected to charge the batteries. Far shot I'm sure but maybe try to over-turn the main motor quickly and see if yours too will display the charge light. Maybe not a good suggestion and I'm sure someone else here can tell you if that's a bad idea.  Once the wires were re-connected properly, the charge light indicator would go on and finally make the charge.  I'd suspect that with yours too, it's reading only 1 battery and the one that's not being used by the trolling motor.  I sure wish I could tell you how but as I said, I'm stupid with such things but would bet it's the same problem.  Maybe take all the connectors off and start new?  Cheers"
204370,legacey,2008-05-21 17:29:00,127,"I just had another thought too......are they all the same battery type?  By chance, you don't have 1 deep cycle, 1 regular or 1 acid and 1 gel?  Cheers"
