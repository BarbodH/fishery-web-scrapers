They have been scraped and cleaned and now comes the painting ... questions:  1) Do they need to be primed first.  There are a few bare spots but paint is adhering to the wood in most spots.  2) Oil base vs water based?  3) Brand for durability.  Any help would be appreicated.  Thanks,  Mark"

Top coat with 100% acrylic, oil paints and way passed their prime. Latex will breath and won't peal unlike the oil paints that are 10-20 year old formulas.  Naturally the surface has to be properly prepped especially the scuffing of the surface by sanding. 100% acrylic will stick to oil paints inside or out."
