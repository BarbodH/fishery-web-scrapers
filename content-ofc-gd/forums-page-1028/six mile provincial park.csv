204573,livinisfishin,2008-05-22 01:18:00,661,I was there on the long weekend and i only seemed to fish at night time because of the crappy weather we had during the days on saturday and sunday. We were at site number 30 right on the water and had no luck the first night. The second night we had loads of brown bull heads. Last year during bass season i caught a 3lb smallmouth right off of the boat launch. Lots of sun fish during day light hours to when it wasnt raining lol
