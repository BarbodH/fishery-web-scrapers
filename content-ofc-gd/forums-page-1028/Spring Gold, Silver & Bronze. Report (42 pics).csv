203946,ehg,2008-05-20 21:14:00,2666,"I read it all. Thoroughly enjoyed this post like most of your others. Super brookies and nice pickerel.  Great post,  ehg"
204050,Moosebunk,2008-05-20 23:50:00,3970,"Thanks again all.  Glad yas enjoyed that one.  It was a few trips in the making and didn't go to press until it found the perfect ending.   Two communities totalling 5000 people share these waterways.  Nearly EVERYONE here fishes in some capacity it seems, unlike southern communities, and of those people that fish here almost all fish are kept as the limits are limitless for 90% of the people.  Add no closed seasons, gill nets, nightlines and even spearing to a small degree, and there's a pile more pressure on the resource.  Then, you have to factor in brackish tidal waters that are 90% of the time useless for catching fish in, so, everyone fishing goes up the river and pounds every productive hole with nets and lines just above where the tidemark ends.  So then, you have to travel beyond the tidemark and further beyond the beaten holes and crowds to get to the first few spots that are half decent SOME of the time.  No roads to drive on to launch your boat up river, treacherously low water levels half of the open water season... it's always work, and except for the dog days of summer and two short spring and fall windows when the fish come to the lower end of the river nearer to the communities, it's always a full day on the water that's needed if one seriously wants great numbers, unpressured fish, or the increased odds of a biggun.  Getting rewarded for the effort is always more gratifying anyways.  Some places around here can be special at the right times and 100 fish days happen.  But all of them require planning and travel."
204290,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-21 13:52:00,0,"Excellant report! If it wasn't for the COLD weather I would move up there! Has global warming affected climate up there? I know this year has been colder than previous years.  Its also very surprising to hear that the fishing isn't as easy as we all thought and that you have to work for your fish up there. Still, it looks like if you put in the effort you can be pleasantly rewarded. Thanks for posting."
204292,RangerGuy,2008-05-21 13:55:00,564,Man what a report! That is truely heaven on earth!  Thanks for the great report
204322,corvette1,2008-05-21 15:08:00,1765,job well done
204426,Golfisher,2008-05-21 19:59:00,586,Superb as always; thanks for taking us along the ride.
204440,muttfish,2008-05-21 20:44:00,20,"the story was great, it must be nice to live a fishermans paradise"
204500,Mike Pike,2008-05-21 23:21:00,1332,"What a report, Moosebunk, and pics!  Thank you.  I won't read any better fishing adventure in a magazine on the newstand.  Your reports really make me glad to be a member of this community.  And what a walleye!!!  Cheers!"
203432,Roy,2008-05-19 23:05:00,13728,"Just excellent, Andrew. You know, everytime I read of your adventures, I don't know why but I get a feeling that there's a Mark Twain tinge to them. Very nice and thank you for taking the time."
203451,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-19 23:49:00,3761,Looks like a trip of a lifetime. Glad you had so much fun. Those fish looked perfect and the landscape looked untouched. Thanks for the pictures and background information.
203463,Crazyhook,2008-05-20 00:04:00,1154,Andrew! awesome report bro! nice work as always
203484,Tomcat,2008-05-20 00:42:00,395,"Another outstanding adventure shared with the rest of us. Thanks very much Andrew. At 65 years of age and with 10 years of retirement already enjoyed, there isn't much that could persuade me to give up my existing life. However, everytime I read one of your adventure reports, I'm ready to jump back 30 years."
203501,mukluk,2008-05-20 01:04:00,196,Man those pictures are fabulous; enjoyed the trip immensely. It's like I was sitting in the canoe with you. Beauty fish. Thanks for sharing again.
203509,Basskicker,2008-05-20 01:19:00,421,That was one of the most amazing reports I have read in a long time.....probably since the last time I read one of yours.  Beautiful scenery up that way....I can't wait I leave in 4 days for north of Cochrane.
203519,johnnyb,2008-05-20 01:37:00,3413,wowowow that's a report!  Thanks for sharing
203533,tbayboy,2008-05-20 02:08:00,1497,"Oh yawn another moosebunk report - same old same old ... ahhh I can't do it with a straight face .   Great stories and fantastic pictures, that walleye is just amazing - 7lbs of pure natural beauty.  Thanks for keeping us dreaming of trips up north!"
203550,walleyemaster,2008-05-20 02:37:00,325,excelent pictures awsome report and beautiful area...
203557,HTHM,2008-05-20 02:58:00,4082,"You sir, are a true outdoorsman."
203563,JoshS,2008-05-20 03:15:00,729,Unbelievable.  thank you.
203571,hairywater,2008-05-20 03:55:00,15,"Super report, a great example for everyone. Thanks"
203587,jediangler,2008-05-20 06:32:00,1923,Another BEAUTY report man. That pick of the stomach contents on the filet knife was my favourite. Well done
203600,Rich Clemens,2008-05-20 11:00:00,3131,Great report Mr. Bunker.  Love it !
203602,Greencoachdog,2008-05-20 11:06:00,8163,Great report and beauty pics!!!
203605,danbouck,2008-05-20 11:09:00,4380,Another fantastic report!
203638,John,2008-05-20 12:42:00,2956,"Amazing as usual Drew. I read it again this morning and it was a ""two and a half coffee"" read .....  I hope that you are archiving your trip reports somewhere. One winter you should edit them, I'm certain that someone would love to publish your ""work""...."
203649,MJL,2008-05-20 12:52:00,2427,A mind blowingly orgasmic report Moosebunk  Beautiful pics.  Thanks for sharing
203658,dannyboy,2008-05-20 13:05:00,367,"Great read, thanks for sharing.  Dan"
203668,Tacklebuster,2008-05-20 13:21:00,303,"What can be said that hasn't already...another incredible report.   Having read your reports over the years, it always surprises me how much effort it can be(or how many miles you travel by boat) to get into some fish.  Probably a result of watching all those fishing shows, I always imagine that fishing in the far remote northern regions it would be harder to keep the fish off your line, and getting skunked is near impossible. Keep those reports and pics coming, I look forward to that next fantasy fishing trip, and personal best Brooky."
203695,bpsbassman,2008-05-20 14:14:00,941, Something you should seriously consider.  Another great report Bunk (as always).  I got a BONER reading it!!!
203754,Victor,2008-05-20 16:03:00,1609,Absolutely amazing! Always loved your reports and enjoyed reading them.  Thank you for taking the time to share with us.
203756,douG,2008-05-20 16:13:00,2693,"Thanks again, Bunk."
203809,Rich,2008-05-20 18:10:00,3927,"Bunk, though I love everything about your reports, perhaps the thing I love most is the colours on those fish. They just look pristine, and untouched. The pike and 'eyes I get down here are always scraggly and beat up, at least marked up. Those look like a painting. Just perfect.  AWESOME!"
203831,snag,2008-05-20 18:42:00,1932,"I admit that I could only read a fraction due to work.  The pics say a 1000 words on top of your actual 10,000 words."
203342,Photoz,2008-05-19 19:06:00,792,"When I die, I want to go to your neighbourhood . . . .    that's close enough to heaven for me!! This article belongs in a NATIONAL fishing magazine . . . .    thanks for taking all the time & effort to take me right along with you . . . .    I've now gone over it 3 times! I guess the only down side of all this beauty are the bugs that come with it. I hear the only way to tell the difference between a raven and a black fly up there . . . .     the raven is the smaller one, and has feathers!"
203343,silveradosheriff,2008-05-19 19:07:00,1025,Awesome report - thanks for sharing!
203346,salmon,2008-05-19 19:11:00,334,WOW is all I can say Awesome report as usual
203347,Moosebunk,2008-05-19 19:16:00,3970," That was good Photoz.  No blackflies out yet.  Should be a couple more weeks.  They aren't all that bad on the river, in the breeze.  Would never set foot in the bush though.  It's good times up here fishing.  I agree, heaven somedays for sure."
203348,Terry,2008-05-19 19:18:00,14456,that is not a report           it's a short story    another great one

203371,ccmtcanada,2008-05-19 20:09:00,7971,"Man oh man...what a report!  Even when the fishing is tough, I'm still glued to every single word.  Congrats on your PB walleye....a monster for sure!  I could see memoirs of your journeys in a book one day....and being on the best sellers list.....  The trips you get to go on...are ones I can only dream about.  Thanks for taking the time on this one!"
203372,Photoz,2008-05-19 20:11:00,792,'BONER' . . . . .  .     abbreviation for bonefish maybe . . . . .    ? Didn't realize they were that far north?
203374,Musky or Specks,2008-05-19 20:16:00,2710,Another fantastic report. I absolutely look forward to your next. Those sea run brookies are very silver. I imagine as sea run fish they have a little more fight to them than residents do.
203377,fishindevil,2008-05-19 20:21:00,6254,"WOW..Absolutely amazing !!!!!   ..man thats another stellar report as usual,it sure is gods country up there,and the scenery & fishing seems to be,just incredible,  thanks for the great read and all the hard work you put into your posts !!!!!!"
