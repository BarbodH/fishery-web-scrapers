My buddy & I had a blast this weekend, went 11/15 and they were all spawned-out females  Arrived Thornbury around 6:00am and there were some people fishing already. we were told that nothing was happening and probably it is the end of the trout season.  Needless to say, my buddy & I setup our stuff and started fishing at a little stretch where no one was around ... casts after casts for 30mins .. and my buddy's float went down at the usual place where the snag was. so he pulled it gentley and walked up the river to try to take it out ... and BANG! FISH ON! it started going downstream like there is no tomorrow and my buddy traced it until the water is too deep, hahaha stayed at the same strech for another 5 hours and got 7/8  Took a lunch and drove to Meaford  worked our way up and started fishing at a stretch with 5 other people there were so many fish jumping around and it was basically non-stop action among us. went 4/7 when going home @ 7:00pm  Once again, special thanks to everyone who makes this board popular and a fun place to hang around!"
