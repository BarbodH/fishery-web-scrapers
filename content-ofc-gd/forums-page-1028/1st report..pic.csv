203963,sash,2008-05-20 21:35:00,26,"so as tradition follows we had another nasty long weekend, there were many hardy men out on  the kawartha lake  that was hopefully holding my gf's 1st crappie. after watching the tops curl on the waves some better judgement led me to a park with a boat launch on the river. we loaded up for the maiden voyage of my new toy that was built for adventure and even tried to find bays out of the wind on the river.  boat control was tuff but the elec motor did great..the homemade mount held in there but needs some more work.    oh wait the fishing...we found some perch and cont'd to play with  them till we had to leave, i even found a rocky and kind of asked where the net was as we had the lite rods out...then i saw him.lol.   well no crappy so we have to fish again.

204032,ccmtcanada,2008-05-20 23:18:00,7971,Good stuff!  I know you were out there to test your canoe setup right?  Fishing was secondary and you still got into a few.  Success on all accounts!
204037,tibbs,2008-05-20 23:29:00,650,Better then sitting at your computer all day!

204268,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-21 12:52:00,0,Sounds like the maiden voyage was a success. The season has only begun and the fishing will definately get better. Looking forward to your next report!
