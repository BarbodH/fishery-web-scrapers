203845,Headhunter,2008-05-20 18:53:00,5703,"Gerritt, Bill Parker, Gerritt's BIL (Mark) and myself were once again fortunate enough to have been invited back to Bernies cottage on Nip, this time for some opening season pickereye fishin. Meet up with G, Bill and Mark at Gerritt's office at 7 and the 400 at 6:30 on Friday morning, loaded up my stuff and we were on our way. Mark saw his first ever, not at a zoo Moose on the side of the road and with some clever chatter, time flew and before you knew it, we were in Powasson. Bernie met us at the launch, we loaded up Bernies pontoon boat, G's boat and we were off to the cottage. As we were not allowed to fish until Saturday, we started out our trip by trying very hard to put a dent into our beverage supply. Saturday morning, we hit the water, it was a little cool, cloudy and breezy, but with the company kept, I didn't really notice. Bernie guided us to many of his usual haunts, but there just wasn't many fish around to be caught. By all accounts, the season is still about 2-3 weeks late, so the fish were scattered at best. Not much to show for our efforts but some laughs and a few dinky perch. So no fish for dinner, we dove into the Prime Rib roast G brought along and he wasn't kidding about the quality of the meat his butcher provides! Sunday we woke to similar weather as Sunday, just more rain and wind... fished most of the morning with limited success, until we tried an island that was taking the brunt of the waves. Once we got set up, both Bill and I hit some slot fish... no, I won't mention the sheepy's Bill! Back to Bernies for some supper, back out for some fish... nothin doing. Monday was a wash out... weather was just to stupid for fishin, boat control being our paramount concern. After the long drive down hwy 11, I arrived back home by about 6:30 pm Monday night. As always, I had a blast... laughing, fishing, eating... everything that goes with having a great time! Thanks again Bernie for allowing us to once again, turn your cottage upside down! To Gerritt, your the best dude! Bill, a pleasure to fish with and Mark, if you do get a chance to read this... ""It you! no you... your good!""  If you've not met Bernie yet, you owe it to your self to stop on your way by to introduce yourself... he's without a doubt, the best! HH PS... now most don't know that Bernie can catch fish, virtually any time he wants... he has the knowledge, the experience and the willingness to get the job done. I for one, also know that if we had not been there this past weekend, Bernie would probably not have fished. I want to personally thank Bernie for taking us out! It was cold, wet and just not the kind of day/weekend, those who have this incredible resource in the their backyard NEED to get out in, but Bernie took us out, froze his baah doop doo off and never once suggested that we hit the cottage for some warm up! Bernie my friend, you are the best! THANK YOU!!!!!!!"
