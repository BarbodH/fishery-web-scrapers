204092,MJL,2008-05-21 00:41:00,2427,"About 4-5 yrs ago my friends from high-school wanted to do a camping trip in Algonquin park right after the May long weekend.  They have been camping only once before in summer.  None of them were (still aren't) really outdoors type of people.  Their plan was to do the Canoe Lake -> Big Trout Lake -> Burnt Lake route (Or something along those lines).  I was up for it.  None of them are really strong paddlers either and none of them really had proper rain gear (Still don't).  They also never planned on the weather to be -10 degrees at night.  The weather was horrible the first day with heavy rain and ultra high winds.  2 of them in one canoe also didn't know how to paddle straight.  I was comfortable in my Gore-tex gear, waterproof socks/shoes, waterproof gloves, etc...They obviously weren't.  At night it dropped to -10 or so and I was relatively warm with a few layers of fleece and wool...They definitely weren't.  We spent one more night at the same lake (they didn't even want to portage/paddle any further) and they had just about enough of it.  We ended up going to Orillia and they went to Casino Rama while I fished Couchaching near the narrows for panfish in my canoe.  We stayed at the Days Inn across the casino for a couple nights - The 2 most desperate ones of the group took the bill for the hotel."
204121,Hookset,2008-05-21 01:37:00,367,"Ahhh heck....it wasn't that bad    .  Walleye fishing all weekend here and we had the following :  Rain Rain and snow Rain and sleet Rain and Sun ??? Snow and Sun ??? Snow Sleet Black Flies.  oh ya and WIND.  But hey, we caught some nice 'Eyes. And the weather just made the fillets taste that much better.  I knew it was cold when I got a minnow outta the bucket and my hand actually warmed up.  The May two four weekend - it'll put hair on ya in places you never expected.   Hookset."
204701,banger,2008-05-22 10:51:00,95,   I did'nt know what Lake it was till the last minute. LOL  Lake ONT! the fishing was great! ( for the amount of time spent on the water) I was near and around Picton/Bellvile.  I did'nt take the pop up.It's not ready for a road trip yet. We ruff'd er.
203943,steve_paul,2008-05-20 21:06:00,658,"Just got back in from our long weekend at the French River - very cold and wouldn't trade it for the world.  Just me and the 2 kids and we had a blast despite the freezing temps.  Lot of rain, hail, wind and cold but we survived.  Burned alot of firewood at night to keep warm, we smell like the south end of a northbound mule, didn't catch alot of fish but as I said would not trade it for anything.  Was nice to see the 2 kids cooperate, work together, get things done and even sometimes get along as we had no choice.  Now, that being said, putting up with that, we do deserve some extra nice weather on the Canada Day Holiday when we are up there next."
203149,Clampet,2008-05-19 01:24:00,1947,"Is it freezing or what?!! Man, I feel bad for anyone who gritted their teeth and headed out fer the ""May 24"" long-weekend, against their better judgement.  Throw a couple logs in the hearth tonight."
203153,steve barrett,2008-05-19 01:48:00,142,
203154,Mattones,2008-05-19 01:48:00,587,and to think I was going to go this weekend.  I don't really find it very cold. tonight. everyone else does.. lol
203156,Joey,2008-05-19 01:51:00,9122,"Yep, we were thinking of going too, but previous frozen May 24 weekends had me questioning whether we should.  Now I'm glad I listened to that inner voice.  Joey"
203159,shane,2008-05-19 02:16:00,652,HaHaHa!  All my May24 camping memories are cold and wet.  It's what makes us Canadian!
203162,Greencoachdog,2008-05-19 02:28:00,8163, What's up wit dat???... that's not 'til next weekend...
203166,Joey,2008-05-19 02:38:00,9122,May 24 weekend refers to a case of beer long weekend in Canada you silly yankee  Joey
203167,ccmtcanada,2008-05-19 02:42:00,7971,"Everyone FREEZES their butts off at least ONCE on the May 24 weekend.  The good thing is that the alcohol in your bloodstream acts like antifreeze in your system....  The first time this happens is when you are about 16 or 17 and you are camping for the first time without family and with your friends.  Smart ones will get sites with electricity and buy heaters for future years.  Not-so-smart ones like me go the next year and swear that next year you'll bring one.  Then finally, once you hit your mid 20's, camping on that weekend doesn't happen anymore.....  Anyone else follow a pattern similar??? LOL."
203176,Greencoachdog,2008-05-19 02:51:00,8163,"  Ok, dat 'splains it... but ya aint gotta call me dirty names!!!  I'za Redneck!!!"
203179,bucktail,2008-05-19 02:53:00,1857,"Man it is COLD out there tonight, Will be lots of frost up in the Kawarthas. Supposed to warm up near the end of the week."
203191,HTHM,2008-05-19 03:19:00,4082,"GCD (or my favorite Redneck), I have to apologize for my fellow Canadians mis-spelling the May 24 weekend. It is actually spelled the May two-four and falls on the weekend that we celebrate our queen's birthday. It was actually started as a celebration of Queen Victoria's birthday. Your history lesson for the day. Your second is .....The only time the US and Canada were at war, 1812, .....we kicked ur butts."
203249,ssminnow,2008-05-19 13:16:00,48," Followed that pattern to a T.  You would also try and look at the good points.  At least the bugs are not as bad, it's not snowing and most importantly at least the ice in the beer cooler is holding up well."
203257,Sinker,2008-05-19 14:03:00,8692,A little cold never hurt anyone. Just brings out the canuck in a person. Keeps the bugs away too.....  Sinker
203261,Pachone,2008-05-19 14:15:00,276,"LOL in 2 weeks it should still be a little chilly in Algonquin....thats why we have 4 people in a 3 person tent! just a lil extra body warmth... we call it ""sleeping like sardines"""
203269,Musky or Specks,2008-05-19 15:26:00,2710,Make  sure you bring bug jackets and plenty of deet. Im predicting a bumber crop of blackflies this year.
203287,ehg,2008-05-19 16:19:00,2666,"Was looking at temperatures around Ontario this morning. Saw 5 degrees celcius to 3 degrees up to Parry sound, then less than that northward. It was 1 degree from Algonquin northward including 0's around Sudbury, Timmins etc... with snow showers. Brutal for camping and fishing especially with the wind.  ehg"
203334,danbouck,2008-05-19 18:29:00,4380,I slipped on ice in my boat this morning
203388,Cookslav,2008-05-19 20:41:00,1457,Bah.... call me Crazy but I Kind of like it? Camping in adverse conditions seperates the Men from the Boys IMO Although Its worth mentioning My wife would say the men are smart ones and can admit its best to stay home.
203389,ccmtcanada,2008-05-19 20:50:00,7971," So...what separates the smart guys from the dumb ones?  LOL.  Back in my younger days, I didn't care how cold it got....always had a great time and a story or two to tell....but not on this family oriented site....hehe."
203401,fishindevil,2008-05-19 21:33:00,6254,"Well we did go camping all weekend and it was miserable,but thanks to good freinds and lots of laughs it was bearable,and the fishing sucked too !!!! oh well it was still worth it anyway,it beats sitting at home thats for sure,and we did manage to have a few fillets of walleye to eat,so that was great,but hey you know its gonna rain on the may24,it always happens.....cheers"
203426,lew,2008-05-19 22:54:00,12767,"I just got back myself from our annual long weekend camping / fishing at Quinte and we had an excellent time despite some rain, cold temps and huge winds, you just need to be prepared for it and act accordingly.  Lotsa fleece clothes, a good Gore-Tex rainsuit, a waterproof tent & heater and good company and you can put up with anything the weather doods throw at ya. Hang a 20' x 30' tarp from the trees and keep a huge bonefire going steady and a bit of nasty weather means nothing  As always, the pickeral & pike fishing was excellent at night around the Glenora ferry and everybody in our group had a fabulous weekend. The biggest pickeral was around 10 pounds and came on a perch colored  minnow bait trolled over the weeds about 10 o'clock Saturday night.  Getting ready for whatever they wanted to throw at us  "
203431,Clampet,2008-05-19 23:05:00,1947," Preparation is key.  Experience heps a mite, as is evidenced here."
203435,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-19 23:22:00,3761,"Yup We froze this weekend alright. We have a popup trailer and stayed from friday to last night. It was cold and being next to the lake didnt help as the winds and rain were horrible. But you got to do what you got to do, thats camping and fishing. We do have a furnance in the trailer and yes we did use it. The pic was not from this weekend but thats our trailer."
203457,TJQ,2008-05-19 23:51:00,7806,All I can say.. is Im glad there was a woodstove in my tent!!!
203474,nancur373,2008-05-20 00:28:00,1211,"Just got back from Durham Conservation Campground around 4pm. Friday evening it rained a little but cleared up low of 9 at night. Saturday morning was cool and damp, went up to 12 during the day. Afternoon was nice. Got a little fishin in on the river just below the swimming dam. Saturday night was nice around the fire with a 24. Then it got cold. Went down to 5 degrees and then the heavens opened up around 3am on Sunday and lasted all day till around 3pm. But it did go up to 8 degrees in the afternoon. No fishing. Sunday night went down to 1 degree and got a lot of freezing rain between 4 am and 8am. warmed up a little, drizzle till noon then cleared up. Ate lunch, packed up and headed back down the highway. Wife complained about cold a bit. Son was ok as was I. Had his playpen in the tent too. Did not have a tent heater but I do put a 75 below sleeping bag underneath the double thick queen air matress. And the wife had about 3 comforters and 2 knitted wool blankets on top. Was cold and wet...but then so was the beer. Fire and food were hot and with a tarp over the table we ate out of the rain. Can't wait till next May 24."
