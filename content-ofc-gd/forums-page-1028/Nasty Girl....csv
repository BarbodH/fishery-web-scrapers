A buddy bought a couple a few years ago at CTC here in Kingston. They sold out quickly and never could get them back in; Nasty Boys they did get but they're too light for casting.  He contacted the company last year and they sent him a box full of what they had. They didn't say they were going out of business so he sold some to the rest of us.  Well, it looks like they did go out of business. The contact information on the packaging is no longer valid.  We've hammered pike, walleye and bass on them and would appreciate it if anyone could tell me where I could get some.  Cheers,  Paul"

A little sideways googling showed ""Lure King"" sharing an address & phone number with a company called ""L K Specialties Inc.""  This vaguely-named company makes/exports fishing lures from an address in Bolton now, according to their profile on Industry Canada's website.  Good luck!"
