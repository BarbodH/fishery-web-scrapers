Just a few short hours of work tomorrow (if you wanna a cheap deal on a car, tomorrow's the day -- call me!  I'll sell it nice and cheap so I can get outta there quick...lol), then it's off to the great white North! Or the great Wet North, according to the forecasts. A big thanks to the more than-a-few of you who have helped me out with maps and techniques....so I am super-positive that I will have SOMETHING to report when I come back. For the record:  It's Temagami on Thursday, camping close to Kokoko Lake, hitting the surrounding back lakes, and back down on Monday in the rain. Yes, I know tomorrow's only Wednesday, and I don't hit the water 'till Thursday, but I drive halfway up tomorrow, then leave super early Thursday morning.  Waaahoooo!!!!  Just a little bit excited, as I sit here surrounded by maps that are about to get packed up.  Happy trails!"
