204351,dannyboy,2008-05-21 16:38:00,367,"Went to Algonquin Park this past long weekend for some camping, canoeing, and fishing. It rained a bit, but we were prepared so it was enjoyable, no bugs with the cool weather.  Some nice trout water:  So we stopped and fished:  My daughter's first Brook Trout:  Amazing colours:  I have to remember to keep my mouth shut:  I was using a fly rod and the trout were smacking the streamers right on the surface, this is a Mickey Finn I tied:  Supper time with our mascot:   We did our longest portage to date 2170 meters, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Thanks for looking Dan"

204391,solopaddler,2008-05-21 18:22:00,8605,"Great stuff, can't wait 'till my daughter's old enough to take along."
204393,dannyboy,2008-05-21 18:31:00,367,"Thanks for all the comments.  We went in at the Rock Lake campground, stayed on Pen Lake went to Welcome, Harry, Rence, and Clydegale Lakes and also paddled up the South Madawaska River. We didn't do too well on the lakes but had better luck in rapids and in the fast runs over beaver dams.  I am certainly fortunate to have a family that loves the outdoors, my daughter has come through a lot but never complains - every day is special.  Dan"
