203944,Bernie,2008-05-20 21:07:00,3190,"I had four guys visiting me this past weekend. We have only fished together a couple of times but they are like old friends already. We shared many laughs along with frozen body parts. The fire was warm and the remainder of my wood pile shows it. Geez, the weather quite plainly sucked. and generally so did the catching of fish. I think we all caught something through the weekend.  Joe's Pickerel   Bill kind of fell off the end of the pontoon boat and got his feet wet. He found my slippers and put them on.   Here's a pic of Gerritt with a really big one on. I will let him tell you what it was.   Bill tried to hook the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.   Joe tried too but he was using monofilament and a beat up Quantum.   May post more on this later but thats enough for now."

I will be sure to upload Marks pictures, I did not have my camera with me as my wife needed it this weekend, I do have a video clip though.. but it is not very family friendly... something about putting fur on my boat and making sweet sweet love to it? LOL  wicked pictures Bernie, and an even better weekend spent with the fellas!  G"
203959,huntervasili,2008-05-20 21:26:00,1604,"Yup, Had a great time up there forsure! only got a couple soakers too... Those fuzzies were pretty darn comfy though, might have to find me a pair  The company and the food made up for the lack of catching, and I sure enjoyed my weekend regardless of the weather!"
