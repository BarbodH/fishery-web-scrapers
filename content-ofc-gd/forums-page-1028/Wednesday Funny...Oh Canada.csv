204235,John,2008-05-21 11:33:00,2956,"A woman from Vancouver, who was a tree hugger and anti-hunter, purchased acres of timberland, near Lake Cowichan , Vancouver Island . There was a huge tree on one of the highest points in the tract. She wanted to view the natural splendor of her land, so she climbed the tree. As she neared the top, she encountered a spotted owl . It attacked her! In her haste to escape, the woman slid down the tree to the ground. The ensuing fall incurred several wood splinters: in her crotch.  In considerable pain, she hurried to the nearest doctor, 35 minutes away, in Duncan . She told him she was an environmentalist and anti-hunter and how she came to receive all of the splinters. The doctor listened to her story with great patience. He then told her to go into the examining room and he would see if he could help. The woman sat, and sat, waiting for three hours before the doctor reappeared.  The angry woman demanded, ""What took you so long?""  He smiled and said , ""Well, I had to get permits from Environment Canada, the BC Forest Service and Worksafe BC before I could remove old-growth timber from a recreational area. I'm sorry, but they turned me down."""
