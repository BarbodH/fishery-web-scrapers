204261,nuke,2008-05-21 12:37:00,60,"Computer gurus out there, why can't I view pictures on my work computer when they are placed between text on the threads ?  If they are sent out as attachments, no problem, in with text, jack squat ! I tried playing with the internet options with no luck.  Even went back to default settings with low security, nothing doin'.  Any help would be very much appreciated.  Nuke"
