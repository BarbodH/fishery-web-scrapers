204410,misfish,2008-05-21 19:28:00,29133,"Sonja Puzic The Windsor Star   Monday, May 19, 2008   Two local anglers are facing charges for allegedly selling walleye and yellow perch illegally.  The Ministry of Natural Resources apprehended the anglers in LaSalle and Windsor last week after a 13-month investigation.  Both anglers had sport fishing licences but it is alleged they have been catching over the walleye limits and selling fish illegally. The ministry suspects they have been doing it ""for years,"" said Kevin Sprague, a conservation officer with the Lake Erie Enforcement Team.  A local commercial establishment, which bought fish from the anglers, is also facing charges, Sprague said.  No names will not be released until arraignment, he said.  Conservation officers also seized two vehicles, a fishing vessel, a commercial scaler, a processing table, fridge, freezer and some fishing gear.  Sprague said the ministry began monitoring the anglers' activities after receiving a tip. He said the investigation was a lengthy one because ""we wanted to get a sense of who was all involved.""  ""Every month, we were getting a new player."""
