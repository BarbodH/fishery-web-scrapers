(quoted from ticketmaster.ca, the CANADIAN site)  THAT IS TOTAL CRAP! They shouldnt be able to do this. What is the point of having them on the Canadian ticketmaster site, if you cannot buy tickets?!?!?  :wallbash:  :wallbash:  :wallbash:"

204317,Billy Bob,2008-05-21 14:55:00,5865,That reminds me of when the Sky Dome first opened up in Toronto and anyone in the US couldn't buy a ticket for any games for several years. Now they market the Blue Jays here in the Buffalo area.  What goes around comes around
