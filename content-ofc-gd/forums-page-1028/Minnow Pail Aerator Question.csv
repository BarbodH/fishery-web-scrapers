204509,Dondorfish,2008-05-21 23:36:00,1000,Nope - same thing as an aquarium pump. We use one ice fishing and have it on all weekend - never been a problem yet!  Hope this helps  Don  
204518,Billy Bob,2008-05-21 23:46:00,5865,IF you can still find one (doubt it) the best aerator I ever had was one that floated on the top of the water and looked like a big red bobber. Not only did it aerate the water but also cooled it a bit. It ran on one 6 volt battery but you could hook it up to your battery charger overnight. Has anyone else owned one of these ? ? ?  Edited to add: GOOD NEWS to anyone who uses minnows. I found the product that I referred to in the above post. Here it is. http://www.sportsmansguide.com/net/cb/cb.aspx?a=70611  Bob
