204404,YUMMYAPPLE,2008-05-21 19:06:00,9,"I plan on going shore fishing at 50 point Conservation area in Hamilton, ON.  1) Will I catch anything? Is this a good time to catch crappie? I heard that the water might be too cold for fish. Please let me know if this applies to crappie.  2) Any good locations at 50 point to fish?  3) anything else I need to know? I am very new to fishing so tips and advice are greatly appreciated!  Any help is much appreciated!  Thanks!"

Watch for where other guys are fishing and try to watch what they're doing or using.  Maybe try talking to them.  Some guys will be helpful.  Anyways, good luck and post some pics."
