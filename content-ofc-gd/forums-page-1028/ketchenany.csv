I did some work for Canadian Tire in Bowmanville over the winter and the Q was my payment. Works like a charm and has lots of toys, as you guessed the ribs were the FIRST on and lots of other things followed and thanks to Gerritt, a good time was had by all. 4 racks and all that was left were the bones.  Again thanks Gerritt  :clapping:  A"
