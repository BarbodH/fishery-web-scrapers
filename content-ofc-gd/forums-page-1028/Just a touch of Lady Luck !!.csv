203967,lew,2008-05-20 21:39:00,12767,"I posted earlier today that I was purchasing a new cot for my tent from BPS this week and it was gonna cost me $100.  Well, this afternoon I received a letter from the Princess Margaret Lottery folks telling me I'd won a prize in the latest draw and they enclosed a cheque for........you guessed it......$100  Fate....coincidence.....Karma ??  Whatever it was, ya gotta luv it when a plan comes together"
203970,Rich,2008-05-20 21:40:00,3927,Nice!
203971,tibbs,2008-05-20 21:41:00,650,Congrats!  Hope you enjoy your new cot!
203975,misfish,2008-05-20 21:44:00,29133,"Lew with you,Karma is always around. Congrats."
203981,danc,2008-05-20 21:51:00,4677,Nice Lew. But just maybe you should have been planning to buy a new Mercedes this week instead of a cot. Good for you Bud..
203983,Roy,2008-05-20 21:55:00,13728,"Happy for you, Lew. Joey and I were just discussing that very thing about 2 weeks ago. I missed though cause I was sure you'd get the house"
203986,bigbuck,2008-05-20 21:58:00,2449,"NICE!!! A free cot, now you have the $100 that you were going to spend on the cot burning a hole in your pocket - dinner with the colonel or a few brand new muskie baits - hmmmmmmmmmmmmm......................"
203987,sonny,2008-05-20 22:06:00,511,"I'd say congrats but i know ya just got your money back on the ticket,,but still a nice surprise,,,maybe it means you should spent 200 bucks,,,lol"
203989,danbo,2008-05-20 22:07:00,2646,Atta boy!
204000,lew,2008-05-20 22:28:00,12767,"Thanks for the laffs fellas, but to be perfectly honest, the Princess Margaret Lottery is one I don't mind losing to cause even if my tickets don't win any prizes, my $$$$ has gone to a wonderful organization.  We buy many $150 tickets every year and I can't think of a better place to give my money to."
204044,ketchenany,2008-05-20 23:40:00,3229,"Sleep tight Lew, you helped a good cause and deserve it."

204103,Joey,2008-05-21 00:58:00,9122,"That's fantastic Lew, I'm happy for you.  I was crossing my fingers and toes for the house, but I guess its a start, next the dresser  Way to go hon.  Joey"
204119,mukluk,2008-05-21 01:29:00,196,Lady luck loves you Lew!  (tongue twister). Congratulations.  Over the years I have donated $1100.00 but like you mentioned to a very worthwhile cause.
204208,Big Cliff,2008-05-21 09:23:00,6899,"Ahhhh, a nice cot in a tent; doubles your space as you can store stuff under the cot, no more sore hips or back in the morning, much easier to sit on than the ground, you are going to love it, I wouldn't go tenting without one anymore.  The money to buy it.... well, good things come to those that deserve them! Congrats!"
204220,Chris,2008-05-21 10:47:00,405,Lew Karma
