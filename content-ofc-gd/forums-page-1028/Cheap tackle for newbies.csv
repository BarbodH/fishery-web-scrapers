Bass Pro has a new flyer out that shows 25% off on what they are calling Zebco Family Fishing Combo's. The Zebco 33/33 combo has two type 33 metal push button reels and a rod for $19.88. A person could add a second inexpensive spin-cast rod, perhaps something like 6 foot M or even better a MH to give themselves one with a little more backbone. They would be coming away with a light and a heavy outfit that would handle almost any situation."
