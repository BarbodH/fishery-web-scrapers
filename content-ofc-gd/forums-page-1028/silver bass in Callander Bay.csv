Would love to know the exact gps location but if that fails, how about typicall patern and depth for this time of year.  Thanks"

204249,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-21 12:10:00,0,Well this year I found them right in front of sunbeam bungalows. In 18-22 feet of water. Every cast produced a fish within seconds. It became too easy so I switched back to targeting pickeral.  They were caught on a pickeral style rig. With a hook about 6-12 inches above the bell sinker(size depending on the wind but I mostly use 1/4 ounce). Tipped with a minnow.  My friend has caught them on Husky Jerks at night time off the dock in Callander.

204350,Scott S,2008-05-21 16:34:00,203,I take my 7 yr old out to catch them. He has a blast! Both islands in front of Bayview cottages and the channel going out to Nippissing along the pencil reeds always seem to produce! Scooter
