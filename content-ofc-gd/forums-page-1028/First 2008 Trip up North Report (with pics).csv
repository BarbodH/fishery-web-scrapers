204049,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-20 23:47:00,1362,"Friday finally arrived after months of talkin bout the trip up North with the boyz  We left the house at noon and made it up to the lake in record time...we were actually surprised that the traffic was so light the whole way up except for a bit of conjestion passing through North Bay around 4:00PM  The weather Friday evening was gorgeous, and the lake was like glass...hauling all the the gear up to the cabin made us a bit thirsty so we decided to ""down"" a few ice cold beers and get the fishing gear ready for Saturday....  Woke up Saturday morning with a slight pain in my head after 4hrs of sleep and to the not so nice to the sound of rain   ...the wind had also picked up and the lake was rough!!...we had a quick breakfast, put on our rain gear and headed out...the water temps were around 45C and the fish appeared to be down in the 40 - 60' range...our boat only had 1 hit for the day...our buddies had a bit more luck and landed 3 Lakers that night...  Sunday turned out to be a better day as far as weather...we were able to land a couple of Walleye and a crap load of OOS huge bass that were all released at the side of the boat between 6:30 and 8:30 that morning!!  After a great lunch fish fry, we went back out and targeted Lakers....THEY WERE ON FIRE!!!  We managed to catch 10 that afternoon and the arches on the sonar were unbelievable  .....ended up keeping 6 between the 4 of us and went back to the cabin for dinner and drinks!!  Woke up on Monday to blowing snow squalls and rough water  ....this cold front moved in and drove the fish back down and they turned off!!....we caught and released two small lakers and that was it for the entire day...  Woke up early this morning to pack up and head home only to see blue skies and beautiful calm water  Our 2 buddies who are staying up at the cabin until Saturday waved goodbye to us with BIG SMILES on their faces while me and my buddy cursed all the way back to the launch...  All in all it was a great time and can hardly wait for the next trip!!  Here's some pics to share....          Here's a shot of what Monday looked like and you can see the snow in hills along the far shoreline    This is what we woke up to this morning as we left to come home    This was a typical type of cloud that would come in out of nowhere and drop some snow...
