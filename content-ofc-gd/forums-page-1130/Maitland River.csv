Just walk there is always fish in the holes, try the falls, trailer park anywhere in that area you can catch a consistant amount of fish!  And if you go 15 minutes up the road to Port Albert, the Nine Mile river is a gorgeous river but alot smaller than the maitland, most fish are around the mouth of the Nine Mile this time of year.  Anyways, hope this helps, Good Luck!  Hawk"
