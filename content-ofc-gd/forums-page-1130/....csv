126560,fishindevil,2007-10-25 00:47:00,6254,"Well at least that kept ya busy for a while glen !!!!!!! big carp,nice pic....cheers"
126561,Daplumma,2007-10-25 00:50:00,1961,Nice hat!!!.That shirt looks sorta like a walleye catching shirt.Are you still wearing the same clothes that you were wearing in June?I know you believe in lucky fishing lures but you snag one wall-ice and you wear the same clothes for 4 months?You aint right.. Joe
126593,Beans,2007-10-25 02:28:00,3339,Wow !!!...that's one big mamma pig of a carp...gives you an idea of why some of us target them...  Ya...nice hat...I gots one just like it...
126594,douG,2007-10-25 02:46:00,2693,Looking like a Faux Farm ballcap to me.  Dang Cajuns.
126595,MJL,2007-10-25 02:51:00,2427,"That's a beauty fish GCD  The lack of barbels, the blueish/gray colour and the sharp pointy dorsal fin leads me to believe it's a species of buffalo (perhaps smallmouth buffalo)...Is there anyone out there who can make a positive ID on it?  I've never caught a buffalo before but there's something just not ""carpy"" about that fish.  Here's one link I found http://www.roughfish.com/id.html"
126596,Hooked,2007-10-25 03:04:00,891,"Wow, a carp on shiners, who woulda thunk?  Nice going, nothing like a good fight no matter what kinda fish it is."
126597,Joey,2007-10-25 03:10:00,9122,"WOW  Now that's a carp, awesome G!!!  Joey"
126605,007,2007-10-25 03:29:00,537,MJL - I must say that when I first saw the pic I immediately thought that it wasn't a carp either.  Something 'fishy' about the dorsal fin and mouth.   Looked in the books I've got and sure enough I've got to agree that it looks like it could be a Smallmouth Buffalo.  The book says they average 2-10lbs but the rod and line record is 82lbs!!!!!  GCD - either way great catch and nice big surprise!  What are you gonna catch next from that there deep honey hole of yours?!  007
126606,irishfield,2007-10-25 03:33:00,26272,Hey...everything is a little different in 'bama...don't yah know that! LOL
126617,OhioFisherman,2007-10-25 07:56:00,6623,"Whatever it is,carp, buffalo, you look good holding it! I have caught carp on lake shiners here Glen, the vacuum thing, if it`s near their mouth they suck it up."
126619,SlowPoke,2007-10-25 08:22:00,2984,Nice fish G! Am I the only one that doesn't have one of those hats?? LOL! -Brian
126621,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-25 08:26:00,1183,Nice Fish...must be getting cooler there too eh.
126624,lew,2007-10-25 08:31:00,12767,"Gad, that things a brute Glen !!"
126670,Greencoachdog,2007-10-25 12:44:00,8163," It is indeed a Smallmouth Buffalo MJL, thanks for bringing that to my attention! I knew it wasn't exactly a Carp the first time I saw it at the surface because it was silver instead of gold."
126684,Bly,2007-10-25 13:04:00,1556,Nice one Glen!   Thanks....I learned something new today   Gotta love that hat!!
126719,blaque,2007-10-25 15:22:00,2419,SCARED ME FOR A SECOND! Thought it was one of those wacky Asian Carp at a quick glance.
