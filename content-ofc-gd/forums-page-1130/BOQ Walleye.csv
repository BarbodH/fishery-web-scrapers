We caught 3 nice walleye and 2 golden bass if you know what I mean guys Here are some pics: I would like to thank Sam at Carra's in Belliville for setting me up with a nice Okuma rod and reel. Well worth the trip to your store.  <a href=""http://img86.imageshack.us/my.php?image=fishing104xf6.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img86.imageshack.us/img86/2531/fishing104xf6.th.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"" /></a> "

126742,karoloko24,2007-10-25 17:08:00,11,Yes They were keepers. I dont keep to much from boq but if someone from my boat want to keep fish I dont have a problem with that. Maybe next time I will take you out fishing so you can have some BOQ walleye
