123004,spoonman,2007-10-13 14:26:00,103,I went down to the park early this am and there were a few fish jumping. Nothing hit my hooks. There seems to be a lot less fish there than last year at this time. Maybe there is some late fish to come yet. I did see some browns down there. Cheers AL

Unfortunately it wasn't, and there were no salmon there that I could see. There were some Browns, but they weren't actively jumping like they had been a few weeks previous.. I packed it in around 10am, and had nothing to show for my efforts unfortunately. Even the Pike weren't biting when I was throwing spinnerbaits..  I'll be back at Bluffers early on the 30th, and hopefully we wont have back-2-back skunkings.."
