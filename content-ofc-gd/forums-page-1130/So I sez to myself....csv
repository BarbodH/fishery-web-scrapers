126337,irishfield,2007-10-24 16:20:00,26272,Hope it was successful Norm...
126398,Beans,2007-10-24 19:22:00,3339,The way I look at it Wayne...all fishing trips are successful...some are a bit more successful than others...  Not too sure where today's trip fits...  There is about a dozen small smallies and several of the world's greatest sportfish swimming around out there with sore mouths...  The wind was light when I left the dock and picked up quite a bit when I got to my favorite rock pile...and a couple of hours later the north sky got pretty ominous looking...so I headed in closer to home...gave me a chance to check out the weed situation for crappy fishing in the evening...maybe give it a try before the World Serious Series begins tonight...  Driftfishing past Gordon's Rocks...    The sky looking north...

126411,Beans,2007-10-24 20:00:00,3339,"Didn't have my worm bag with me Brian...just my tubes...  As much as I'm a Leaf fan, watching hockey takes a back seat until the baseball season is over...I gotta go with Boston (American League)"
126412,misfish,2007-10-24 20:03:00,29133,"Yep, got to go with the Sox aswell."
126426,motv8tr,2007-10-24 20:46:00,2587,"Glad you managed to get out Norm, and caught a couple of fish to boot  Maureen"
126576,crappieperchhunter,2007-10-25 01:36:00,2582,Glad you got out Beansie...as that is the important part. The catching is always secondary in my humble opinion.  Only about 7 more months until it's time for Carp Point!!!!
