111663,SlowPoke,2007-09-09 16:58:00,2984,That's a great boat Zed. I'm partial to center consoles myself. It looks like you've done a nice job restoring it. Those leaning posts aren't cheap! I was considering one for mine when I refurb it. -Brian  18' Starcraft MR180 - 75 Mariner

111689,SlowPoke,2007-09-09 18:49:00,2984," Thanks Zed. It took a long time to find and work out a deal on this one. It needs floor work but the hull is tight. The downside of this boat is too much weight in the back and not enough room in the back. I intend to solve both problems by relocating the gas cans to a permanent tank either located under the helm seat or by extending my casting deck rearward to allow for a permanent tank. I'm thinking 18-24 gallon capacity.  My attraction to CC's was two-fold. Balance and accessablilty. I still like the balance aspect but the access issue could be a safety issue. My thought was having the ability to fight a fish from either side of the boat and walking around it if needed. With all the commotion of fighting a fish the thought of bumping the throttle scares the bejesus outta me so I block the throttle side off with my upright cooler bag. When/if I get a kicker motor for trolling it'll allow me to open up that side but for now paranoya gets the best of me.  As luck would have it, Chris just took this shot yesterday...  "

111836,Mike the Pike,2007-09-10 01:50:00,3421,Here are my 3 vessels when camping I have 2 other options to go fishing with.   This is my main Boat for the bigger Lakes my 18 foot Lund the big tinny.   This is what I use when camping when I have a water sight.    When I can't get a campsite near the water one can always portage the canoe to the Lake.   Be careful when posting pics of tiller models some southern folks are sometimes offended  MTP
