126301,mattyk,2007-10-24 14:22:00,2110,I will be winterizing my motor myself this year for the first time. I have some good links on websites that people have previously posted before. This may be a silly question. I have a 4stoke merc and i was wondering were exactly do i spray the fogger? I know its around the carb but can anybody post a picture of this part?

Hit the key just enough to move the pistons abit to coat the walls and your done.  Don't forget to change the oil filter when you change the oil."
