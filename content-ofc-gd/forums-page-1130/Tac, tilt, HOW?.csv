126394,misfish,2007-10-24 19:11:00,29133,Never knew there was a thing called a tilt gauge? I just go by my RPM gauge.
126467,aplumma,2007-10-24 22:23:00,6896,Here is a link for a small tach that Joe and I have used for many years.  tini tach link  The Trim gauge can be added to only a trim assy that is wired for it it can most often not be added after it is built. I have trim on my boats without the gauge and have found the tachometer works well for judging the correct position. I usually run on plane and trim up till the rpms jump up slightly then trim back a hair to find the best position.   Art
