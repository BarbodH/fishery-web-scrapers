126396,PERCHER,2007-10-24 19:17:00,787,Bill I dont think you need the flares.
126399,irishfield,2007-10-24 19:22:00,26272,You only need flares in a 6+ meter boat if you are more than a mile from shore. Peter is just very cautious when it comes to these things..and yes I have a gun and flares in my glove box Peter ! LOL  You won't be more than a mile from shore on the Reach.
