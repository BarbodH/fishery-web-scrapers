On the wagon as its called and I'm still strapped in  I'd really like to thank some OFNr's for their help.  GaryV was there at the beginning, as was Beans and BigCliff with their kind words and wisdom.  Lew and Wayne and Chuck make G2G's alot easier on me, and sometimes Art  Roy, you've been there for me all the way and encouraged me and even offered not to drink in front of me.  Spiel, thanks for the card and calls and words of encouragement!  DouG, thanks for the Many calls  And of course Paul, my rock, who has been there through the whole thing and has virtually quit himself to make it easier for me (except at G2G's   ).  Hey, he has an image to live up to, right Big Chief     Seriously, you've been awesome hon.  So thanks to you all and here's to many more happy, healthy years ahead.  Joey"
