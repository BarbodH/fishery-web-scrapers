126447,Photoz,2007-10-24 22:09:00,792,"After going 0 fer 15 (trips) I was thinking of either retiring my rods, or taking a trip up to Costco's fish counter! At about $20.00 for 3  -  2 pound rainbows, a lot cheaper than $200.00 in gas today's trout cost me!! I hit a quiet spot on Lake O., out east, as I wanted to see how good my new 4 pound P-Line would hold up . . . .    IF the fish Gods saw fit to lift the curse which I think P E T A musta laid on me!! I was just about to change my roe bag when I thought I saw my rod tip quiver slightly . . .     as I walked up to my rod holder, I saw . . .    tap . . .   tap . . .   tap, AHA, somebody is knocking . . .   likely a gobie, which I was almost ready to accept. I carefully lifted the rod outta the holder . . . .    WHAM!! WOW, almost took the rod right outta by hand, and at the same time a 'silver bullet' EXPLODED out of the water about 200' out, a back flip, and another, then a DOUBLE flip for an encore, got his bearings . . . .    and headed for the American side!! I sure was happy to have 300 yards to play with, as he took about 100 before I got 'im stopped! Then, inches at a time I carefully started him in . . .    I'd lever him in 10', he'd go back 5', over 20 minutes later I FINALLY had him up on the shore, luckily back a bit from the water, as he dragged my leader over some rocks, and was ALMOST free! I had to sit and rest (and wait to stop shakin') for about 15 minutes . . .    that was hard work! I'm setting my sights on some Simcoe perch tomorrow! Is our 'Bragging Rights' tournie still on? Or has everybody lost interest? Does Team 5 have any BIG perch yet?  "

I am still trying for the bragging rights, although it seems that most interest has worn off...  Give it a try, what can you lose .... there is so much to gain.  Will look for your post ...

126758,bowshep,2007-10-25 18:08:00,378,$200 bucks for a fish... thats cheap in my books... Nice read... Its so cool that they can just strip the line of your reel  in one run... you get them close and they rip back the other way... Nice work... Peace Ken
