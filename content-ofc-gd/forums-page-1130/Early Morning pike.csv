126428,dsn,2007-10-24 20:57:00,1018,Boy was it dark out there this morning. I didn't land anything but saw some fish activity. I didn't even land this pike.      As you can see it was very lightly hooked just by the skin. I saw it take the spoon. Right after these shots the hook popped off.    dsn
126429,Jen,2007-10-24 21:09:00,833,Those are some amazing photographs... wow...  Nice fish too... but wow how crisp and clear  Great post  Cheers Jen
126432,dsn,2007-10-24 21:27:00,1018, Yeah I had to run an erand in the early hrs of the mroning so the sun was just about rising and there was no wind at all. Gotta love it.
126436,1Harringtona,2007-10-24 21:49:00,77,WOW amazing pictures... But how cold was it out there.
126464,fatherof3,2007-10-24 22:21:00,1769,"great shots,too bad he got off"
126545,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-25 00:27:00,0,Good to see the pike are still biting! I'd like to get out at least 1 more time before the season ends!
126551,fishindevil,2007-10-25 00:31:00,6254,"Nice lookin pike !!!!!! great close up pics,and yes was he ever lightly hooked..  ..maybe if you waited to take the pic after you grabed him you might have won..LOL..LOL..LOL    oh well the pics are nice action shots anyway right.....cheers"
126582,007,2007-10-25 01:53:00,537,"Good job addict.... I mean dsn.  Those are some great pictures - what camera have you got?  Fishindevil's right if you spent less time taking action shots you might land more fish!  But then again unhooking snot rockets is never fun so probably easier to let them unhook themselves LOL  Also we get to benefit from some nice photography.  It's quite strange, I haven't seen any pike while i've been fishing T.O this fall.  Must try and catch one before times up or you and SNAG have shown them all the different types of lure!!!  Keep up the good work. 007"
126590,sharper,2007-10-25 02:14:00,279,I was out this morning as well trying my luck for some fall pike. Didn't have much luck.
126638,dsn,2007-10-25 10:08:00,1018,"My camera is the Canon Powershot A700 6X Optical, 6Xmega Pixels, and I think 6X digital (not sure about the digital) I find the odd one or two. SNAG finds the schools."
126640,dsn,2007-10-25 10:11:00,1018,  Yeah I totally agree about waiting to take the pics but you gotta love action shots!! I know I do.  I'm trying to aim for the best fishing action shots photographer in the world.
