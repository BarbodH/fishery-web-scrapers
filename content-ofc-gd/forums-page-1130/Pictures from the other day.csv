Anyways, here are a few pictures of a couple that I caught on Monday, there is more pictures but they are on my buddies camera so it will be a little while before I get ahold of them. This is one I took at first light.   Solid 4-5 pound fish!   Pretty female fish! http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/102_2239.jpg  We really didn't start catching fish that day till about noon, I caught 2 at first light and from there it was pretty slow until noon and we could see them sitting in the hole. We tried everything and then we finally found out what they wanted.  We ended up with 11 between 2 of us, plus another guy came down and decided to stand right over top of the fish we were drifting our bait down to so after that they got pretty spooked but anyways was nice to be the only ones catching fish while everyone else was standing around scratching their heads haha. Anyways going Friday morning to beat the weekend crowd. Good luck everyone!  Hawk"
