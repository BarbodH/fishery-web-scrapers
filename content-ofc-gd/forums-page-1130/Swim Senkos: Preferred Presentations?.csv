116705,mooseroo,2007-09-23 19:57:00,80,I managed to grab some Swim Senkos on my last trip to Dick's Sporting down in Buffalo. I haven't had a chance to try them out yet but wondering if anyone has any tips on using them?  Weighted or weightless? Fast or slow retrieve? Other ideas?
116776,singingdog,2007-09-24 00:00:00,1047,"I have had some good luck with them this year on several different presentations: Weightless on a 4/0 hook On a 1/8 - 1/4 oz jighead (good pickerel bait!) As a trailer for buzz and spinnerbaits. If you fish buzzbaits, you really owe it to yourself to try them out. Take the skirt off, bite off about 1"" of the swimsenko and superglue it on: great way to weed out the small bass and get the big ones.  They are much more durable than a senko and have a competly different swim action than a grub."
126422,mooseroo,2007-10-24 20:33:00,80, That's a great tip of a buzzbait trailer. I'll definitely give it a shot. Might also try it in place of some other trailers on some of my other baits.
126578,Blake,2007-10-25 01:46:00,418,They work great weightless on a Phenix 4/0 30 degree bend hook with a hitch hiker on the eye.  They also work well with the weighted version when doing deeper weedlines.
