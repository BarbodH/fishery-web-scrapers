126271,Meely,2007-10-24 13:00:00,282,"I have changed the line on my Musky rods to Power Pro. Trolled the Kawarthas last weekend and had something slam my bait....and..... snap my line. I am running 40 lb PP.  Question: Is there any particular knot that works better for this line?  I'm using a ""palomer"" (SP) knot right now.....wondering if this is the cause of my problem.  Thanks for any help......  Meely"
126273,lew,2007-10-24 13:03:00,12767,"The palomar is the best knot for Power Pro Meely, but your better off moving up to 80 - 100 # line."
126276,Beans,2007-10-24 13:10:00,3339,What Lew said...(like as if I knew what I'm talking about...LOL)  Not in the boat....it's only a story...!

126310,kickingfrog,2007-10-24 14:46:00,8333,"You may have already tried this but, Power pro has a web site about tying knots with their product.  http://powerpro.com/using/knots.asp"
126331,douG,2007-10-24 15:49:00,2693,"Meely, very important to spit all over your knot as you are drawing it tight.  You'll be able to tell if the knot is drawing up properly."
