The two biggest things I'd warn you against are:  1) Don't clean the filter pads with tap water. The filter pads are not only there to mechanically strain the water but also to promote the growth of a bacterial colony within the pads that breaks down the nasty pollutants coming out of the business end of your fish. The chlorine (assuming municipal water supply) in your tap water will kill all the bacteria in your filter media and cause a yo-yo effect in the tank. The bacteria are more important than the mechanical filtration. You can use a bucket of stale water (water left in a clean aquarium-use-only bucket for 24 hours) and shake/squeeze the filter pads to remove much of the gunk (scientific term) and then replace the pads in the filter. A healthy filter can absorb a little over-feeding.  2) Don't do 50% water changes unless absolutely necessary. A 50% change will so radically change the chemistry of your tanks water that you will again get that yo-yo effect and it will never stabilize. Stick with 10-20% changes weekly and always (if not too inconvenient) use stale water (water in that same bucket at least overnight) to do make your changes. By doing only 10% water changes, you can use a small 1+ gallon bucket to ""make"" stale water overnight and another bucket as a drain/wash bucket. You also won't have to run back and forth from the tap multiple times to make your changes. Two dedicated buckets makes tank maintenance pain free.  The key to easy tank maintenance and healthy fish is to minimize the drastic changes in water quality and balance the feeding with the filter/plants/light levels/temperature.  Bonus Thought: Make sure that only one person in your house can feed the fish. If the food is out, the tendency is to just pop in a bit of food cause they ""looked hungry."" Fish, in particular goldfish and koi, will eat food until the cows come home! Put the food in a cupboard and feed them only once a day. Don't skip days, just feed much less."

Water is relatively clear... no greenish water, but it is still cloudy white....  looks like the new filter/phosphate is doing it's job? but again, i'm still not getting crystal clear water? i changed the water/filter Monday Night...  i can't see clearly through the aquarium?  any ideas?"
126726,Mike Pike,2007-10-25 16:13:00,1332,"I had a similar set-up to yours Buck, just no Pleco.  A couple of fancy goldfish about the same size as your koi in the same size take and no problems.  I'm outa answers, myself.  Really odd your problem."
126743,mpt,2007-10-25 17:12:00,158,"Buck, Take it easy. Wait 2 more days. Once you disturb the bacteria layer it takes a while to clear. There may also be decomposing food still in the tank which has to get broken down. I think the tubidity is from dead bacteria and they need to get broken down also. The filter won't filter them out it has to run it's course. If the fish look health just wait, if they are breathing hard or in active then you may have to try something different. Don't go over 10-15% water changes that really stresses the fish unless you do it quite often to try to get the fish to spawn but they need to get used to it. Good luck and just relax."

125960,Uncle Buck,2007-10-23 13:19:00,1000,"Update...  took a water sample into Big Als... they tested it for nitrates/ph and stuff and the water is fine  i went with an aquaclear 50 ( the 70 was just massive, and i even had to cut the existing filter opening to fit the 50 in) they also told me to put in phosphate remover and that would eliminate the greenish water...  he told me to put the phosphate remover in instead of the biomax...  so i did a 50% water change last night and installed the new filter, the water is a little cloudy (whiteish) but i'll see how that goes after a couple of days on the new filter... if it still remains, i'll try rinsing the gravel at the bottom thoroughly...  If i pressure cook/boil the gravel, will it lose it's color?  i'm thinking the white cloudiness could be caused from the gravel...  i'm feeding them every 3rd day, and i took the heater out... water temp is 72 with a window open all night, koi and pleco seem to be doing well..."
126038,Randy,2007-10-23 17:17:00,115,"Uncle Buck, I'm not sure if you are using charcoal or actvated carbon in your filter. I once made the mistake of using charcoal and not activated carbon.  The activated carbon does a much better job at removing impurities than the charcoal."
126072,camillj,2007-10-23 18:56:00,1988,  OK ... I see a potential problem ... the gravel ... I personally never liked the big rocks - they trap too much food ... and certainly not the painted black and white ones ... you really have to clean that stuff as it will sometimes be the cause of cloudiness (even without anything else in the tank) ... you may need to 'flood' this gravel in a bucket for quite some time (add a little bleach even) to get the water to flow through it and stay clear ... until it does everything else is just icecream on s*&t  ... so rinse it completely clean in a big 5 gal bucket and then re-add it to your tank ... also may consider leaving it out for a few days just to see if this is the cause of your clouding.
126357,mpt,2007-10-24 17:00:00,158,"Uncle buck, Just stop feeding the bacteria in the tank and you should be fine. A fish's stomach is as big as it's eye. Cut back to 6-8 pellets a day and do half a disk every other day. Tank sould clear in 3 days at that temp. Lower temp to 75 if you keep the pleco and want to add more tropicals. Live plants are great if you can get them to take, just keep trying by buying new ones if they die. Try to find some java moss and throw in, it's hardy and should help with the water chemistry. Don't disturb the gravel at all unless you're moving the tank. Once the layer of bacteria starts working they'll keep your tank clear. That's a nice looking tank and at 1"" of fish per gal water you could add a few inches. With the koi stay away from aggresive fish or fin nippers. Most gouramies should be good."
