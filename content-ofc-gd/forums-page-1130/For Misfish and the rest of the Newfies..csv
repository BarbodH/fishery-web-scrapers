125079,Deano,2007-10-20 02:19:00,767,"That's some beautiful country, gotta make it out that way at least once in my life time. Thanks for sharing those."
125081,Dondorfish,2007-10-20 02:20:00,1000,Great pics - Love the Newfie Trim&Tilt!!!   Don
125082,bosc,2007-10-20 02:29:00,23, Sinker... the top pictures are just along the road somewhere....Clarenville to Glovertown area I believe. The boat pictures with the cod would be Hickmans Harbour. Most of the bottom pictures are in the town of Salvage. Salvage is like what Peggy's Cove is to Nova Scotia. Very beautiful unique town.
125102,Sinker,2007-10-20 04:12:00,8692,"Thanks......I'm from the very northern tip of the island, so I don't really get to see the southern end too much. I've been to St. Johns lots of times, and drove thru, but its nice to see in pictures. My dad is there now, he just took his first load of things down. He's headed back to retire....now I have an excuse to visit more!! He's coming back to pick up his boat, and he's gone for good.  I'll get some pics up tomorrow from my home town.  Sinker"
125121,misfish,2007-10-20 11:25:00,29133,Just BEAUTIFUL Rein.  Yes I got a great laugh from the newfie trim.  Thanks for sharing my friend.
125176,Tacklebuster,2007-10-20 15:40:00,303,"great pics, what a country we have.  That Newfie trim is priceless."
125263,fishindevil,2007-10-20 22:50:00,6254,"Thats just amazing scenery !!!!!!   I would love to go out deep sea fishing with those guys for a day and see how to catch all those cods !!!! i watched a guy hand jigging on television for them and man he was getting them,on a squid looking bait  ,and he says its the way you jig the rope,that makes them hit...thanks for sharing,it sure looks nice down there.  ..maybe someone can show me some day...."
125267,Zib,2007-10-20 22:59:00,369, Yes it is. Too funny.
125306,Sinker,2007-10-21 01:10:00,8692,"Heres a few from the Northern Peninsula.  Moose on my Grandfathers rd.    Icebergs...        This is how we jig fish down there......almost like a huge swedish pimple. Just drop it to bottom, and start jigging it by hand. The line is 300lb mono.....and its hard on the hands after hauling up a few hundred pounds of fish!!      This is how we used to do it before the fishing stopped. These are gill nets, but we mostly had cod traps. We had 2 types, a common cod trap, a box shaped trap.....same principle as a minnow trap.....fish go in and can't get out. The other is a japanese trap. Its like a big bag....with a drawstring. Get to the trap and pull the drawsting tight, and the fish were trapped inside. We'd haul the traps 3 times a day, and have anywhere from 3-8000lbs of fish per haul.....talk about hard work!!     This is a shot of my families homestead. My father, and his 13 brothers and sisters were all born in this house......my great grandmother was the midwife for the area. She delivered over 1000 babies in her time...    Heres my Grandfather re-building his wharf. This was summer '06    Heres the finished product, with his boat tied up. Every peice of lumber was hauled out of the woods by skidoo, then run through our sawmill into boards. Pop is a real trooper.....at 84....he'd run most guys around here to the ground without blinking an eye!!    Now I'm really homesick. I havent' been back for almost 10 years!! I'd give my left nut for a whiff of that salty air right now!!  Hope you enjoy, Sinker"
