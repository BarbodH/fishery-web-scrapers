Im fishing a tailout of a pool behind some spawning white tip salmon, and i see this big greenish shadow move up through the rapids.  First drift after that float goes down i set the hook huge headshake than a 100 yd dash through the trees and creek.  Pulled her out of the lumber twice and was praying that the 6lb trilene would hold up it did.  All in all a good way to start the work day. "
