126100,glen,2007-10-23 20:02:00,2641,Thankyou very much Wayne and Rob.  It was an awesome day on the water.  I hope you catch the monster Wayne.
126489,1Harringtona,2007-10-24 22:48:00,77,thats a nice motor you have what HP does it have
126496,irishfield,2007-10-24 22:59:00,26272,275 Horsepower and quiet as a mouse at full power....
126505,solopaddler,2007-10-24 23:22:00,8605,Interesting...I noticed the rod in the left stern holder is angled inwards. Is that common practice? I'm assuming you're running a short lead on that rod right in the boats propwash?
126520,irishfield,2007-10-24 23:40:00,26272,Mike...the one shot shows the rod in it. We were trolling three rods. One each side and one down the middle..just off the edge of the wash. Distance back/down varied as the day went on. Only had a couple instances of tangling as a couple baits didn't run true on the center rod.
126524,solopaddler,2007-10-24 23:50:00,8605,"Yeah of course, 3 guys 3 rods, what was I thinking, LOL!"
126526,Roy,2007-10-24 23:55:00,13728,"Around here, Mike, the downrods are never more than  1-3 wraps out. (7' - 21'). The rod is in the water to keep the bait down but also to pick up any weeds that could possibly foul your bait."
126530,solopaddler,2007-10-25 00:01:00,8605," Hey I just learned something, thanks!"
126532,irishfield,2007-10-25 00:03:00,26272,Thanks Roy...and like I said earlier in this thread Mike..if you're not learning anything..what's the point!
126092,kickingfrog,2007-10-23 19:38:00,8333,I had a great time with Wayne and Glen. I think I'll be seeing that big one in my dreams for days...if only it was a vegetarian.  Here are some of the shots I took:  Heading out        Rods ready  I can't believe how quiet the engine was.
