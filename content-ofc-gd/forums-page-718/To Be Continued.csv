440114,xeon,2010-03-05 06:57:00,350,It isn't the other guys fault that he entered into a high speed pursuit and couldn't handle his vehicle. That's what police who are trained in high speed maneuvers are for.
440118,John Bacon,2010-03-05 08:59:00,3277," Are you referring to Shayne Berwick when you refer to the ""other guy""?  My understanding is that Shayne Berwick was attempting to flee the area in and Dennis Middleton used his truck to run the other vehicle off the road which caused an accident that left Shayne Berwick permanently disabled.  If this is the case then I would say that, yes it is his fault."
