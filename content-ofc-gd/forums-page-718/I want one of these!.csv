438638,kickingfrog,2010-03-01 17:24:00,8333,Wow! We are always coming up with new ways to off ourselves aren't we?  Sure would be a blast though.
438639,uglyfish,2010-03-01 17:30:00,981,ill take 2!!
438711,Twocoda,2010-03-01 22:10:00,4130,there was a guy i met years ago that was working on something similar to these but they werent hovercrafts....his purpose was so you coulod leave your boat out on the deep water and use the flyin method to get supplies and what not ....but i havent seen any grocerystores with landing strips yet...  idea was cool....i wonder what ever happened...but these machines look like alot of fun ...and i can think of many uses for it
438719,Radnine,2010-03-01 22:28:00,1538,"I went for a hovercraft ride last summer in Caledonia (twice actually) and it was a hoot. Loud, but a hoot. Jim"
438734,limeyangler,2010-03-01 23:11:00,5204,  Natural selection...all the way!!!
438736,irishfield,2010-03-01 23:16:00,26272,"Won't ""fly"" here in Canada.. because he has his wings long enough that it will get out of ground effect.. but you can build a true ground effect vehicle with short stubby wings and register it as a boat in Canada.. no pilot licence required. Have a buddy over Orillia way that is building one from scratch... since he lost his medical for his pilots licence.  For those that don't know what ""ground effect"" is.... an airplane will fly slower than it's stall speed within 1/3rd of the length of it's wings. So about 10 feet off the ground in most cases. So a ground effect vehicle is built with just enough wing and thrust to lift it into this range without being able to truely fly off into the sunset."
438739,limeyangler,2010-03-01 23:23:00,5204,  LOL...i was wondering when you'd reply to this...
438740,irishfield,2010-03-01 23:25:00,26272,Some around here actually work.. when they go to work Simon!
438745,Terry,2010-03-01 23:33:00,14456,that would suck  LOL working at work I hope the public sector  doesn't implement this idea.....interesting concept  though
438748,Roy,2010-03-01 23:49:00,13728,Ground effect sounds like a close call.....I prefer the Bernoulli effect....sounds safer.
438787,limeyangler,2010-03-02 01:27:00,5204,  lol...jealousy is such an ugly emotion
438789,irishfield,2010-03-02 01:30:00,26272,Na... remember I only go to work 1/2 the year !! lmao !
438793,pike slayer,2010-03-02 01:41:00,1177,it would be pretty fun playing bumper cars with those things!
440439,bigugli,2010-03-06 01:16:00,6138,Here I was expecting a harrier  with pontoons.
440521,Cudz,2010-03-06 03:29:00,2652,catch a wing tip on a banked turn and it would be game over.
440522,irishfield,2010-03-06 03:31:00,26272, Be like a rock point in the dark ! lol
440524,Cudz,2010-03-06 03:37:00,2652,"Wow, Good memory. I hope you also remember that I wasn't driving."
440527,irishfield,2010-03-06 03:42:00,26272,Yah.. couldn't resist!
