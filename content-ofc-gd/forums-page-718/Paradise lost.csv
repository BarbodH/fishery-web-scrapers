440020,Radnine,2010-03-05 01:51:00,1538,"I was talking to the Rice Lake dude at the fishing show and he told me that the Bellmere Winds golf course and the cottage/trailer resort that went with it (Godfrey's??) had gone belly up. This is a pisser as it was a fantastic course. We used to stay across the lake (at Springbank Camp) and throw the clubs in the boat for a round of golf between peak walleye times. It was sweet, jump out of the boat, jump into a cart and go play 18 holes. I guess that we didn't do it enough to keep the place open. If anyone hears that it has re-opened (DiggyJ) or knows of a similar set up anywhere else could you please drop me a line? It really was a great set-up. Jim"
440021,irishfield,2010-03-05 01:55:00,26272,Dang.. sounds like a real economic failure going on around Rice. They didn't impose a limit on the number of balls you could start the round with did they...  
440030,Terry,2010-03-05 02:10:00,14456, lol where is that video I have with you talking...LOL
440034,irishfield,2010-03-05 02:11:00,26272,Let me get my firehose ready first..  ..sorry Jim! I'm not a golfer...
440325,GeorgeJ,2010-03-05 22:04:00,207,Hopefully things will turn around if they are indeed in a slump. The current cottage life magazine has Rice Lake listed as one the 7 up and coming cottage markets to watch.
440387,tb4me,2010-03-06 00:21:00,3295,Mhh sounds like there may be a small resort and gold course avaiable for sale at a reasonable price?

440428,Radnine,2010-03-06 01:06:00,1538,"  You couldn't be more right. I think that this could be an example of the ""third generation jinx"" on this business. I clearly don't know the details, but this is exactly the kind of business that is big enough to involve many investors. Some could invest capital and some could invest expertise/time, etc. The golf course is magic, and the lake speaks for itself. If you added a restaurant that one could dock at and buy breakfast, no one would ever drive farther north. It makes me wish that I actually has a pot to pee in. Jim"
440443,tb4me,2010-03-06 01:20:00,3295,Was looking for such a resort. I can only get approved for 200 thou..damn..we almost bought a resort on the  Manitulin island..11 cotages fish hut the house and all the boats n stuff..This was 4 yrs ago. we couldnt come up with the extra cash for overhead and startup.The resort owner wanded 179 thou at that time. Damn was I bummed out.
440471,Radnine,2010-03-06 01:44:00,1538, There is a lot of land and expense involved in building a course (I think the cottages and trailers lots are long paid for). I hope that someone re-opens it. Jim
