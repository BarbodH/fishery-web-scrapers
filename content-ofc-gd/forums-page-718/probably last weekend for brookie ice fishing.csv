Thanks"
439797,pike slayer,2010-03-04 19:18:00,1177,"ya try worms in 4-10feet of water near bottom (1 foot) or right on bottom. get a nice shiny #30 silver williams wabler jig it 4-5ft below the ice with light quick little jigs and just keep it moving, its all in the wrist. dace also work decent as well if you want to set a still line."

439827,Jds63,2010-03-04 20:49:00,1365,"    thanks guys I'll give that a try, ... being late in the season ..wasn't sure what to throw ... if you still use the same tactics as at the beginning of ice over"
439848,pike slayer,2010-03-04 21:22:00,1177,my setup works all year and i leave my williams baitless and just let the spoon do the work.

439969,archie_james_c,2010-03-05 00:35:00,618,  4?!?!? Get in 2 and 3 feet you girl!!!!  The one and only Speck I caught this winter was with a #6 Eagle claw treble with the worm's head hooked through two hooks on it. No weight at all in about 3 feet of water laying on bottom.  Last year a Blue/Grey EGB tipped with a minnow head jigged in 3 feet caught this one...  
440006,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-05 01:30:00,0,"i like to use a spoon with the treble removed and a snelled hook with a worm. i also like a variety of small jigging lures like buckshots, crocodiles, egb's, and natural coloured crappie tubes."
