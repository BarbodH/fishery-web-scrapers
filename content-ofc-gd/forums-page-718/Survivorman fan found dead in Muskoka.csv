439975,tightline,2010-03-05 00:40:00,322,for the record Vast means a very great amount...and I have never claimed to be perfect just respectful and courteous...so you better check your Websters<---thats a Dictionary...and give your drivel of a response another crack
439977,Roy,2010-03-05 00:44:00,13728,"People have lost a son, a member of their family.  Worm dangler, you're not forward at all. You're backward and inept. Learn to live with others.  Bigredneck, yes the word censor is in place for people who need to be reminded on how to behave in public. That's the same word censor who has the the power to put insensitive people on modQ.  I'm sure that I won't miss the revenue lost by having either one of you gone.  Goodnight children."
439980,xeon,2010-03-05 00:46:00,350, HAHAHA You know you're considering yourself part of the vast majority group since you just took offense to what he said.
439985,TJQ,2010-03-05 00:51:00,7806,I think Ive heard enough......
439874,Radnine,2010-03-04 22:17:00,1538,"        Are there not enough people waxing poetically about a person that they don't even know, that you guys have to flame someone for having a different opinion? Where are the moderators? oops, never mind. Jim"
439877,archie_james_c,2010-03-04 22:24:00,618,   X2....Know your wilderness capabilities and respect mother nature.  As far as I'm concerned this guy had it coming...
439879,Terry,2010-03-04 22:29:00,14456,"I agree  if you want a news report post it and close the thread if you want a discussion , post it in an open forum....  I am sure everyone feels sad for the family but what do you call a person who goes off, what seems to be unprepared, because he saw it on a tv show and gets himself dead    so lets come up with a word that is socially exceptionable to call him"
439880,irishfield,2010-03-04 22:29:00,26272,"41 and he made a living doing errands for an 86 year old women, while living in her basement... hmmmm  My condolences to his family for sure..."
439883,archie_james_c,2010-03-04 22:31:00,618,  Strange how everyone bashed Worm Dangler in the first page but now that there are a couple ppl who feel the same about it no one is speaking up against it????
439887,dickie,2010-03-04 22:43:00,64,"In this country you have the freedom to do what you want as long as long as you do not put anyone else at risk. That is something we have to be very thankful for. However we do not have the right to belittle anyone. He didn't purposely hurt anyone. He died doing what he loved to do. I'm sure if anyone thinks hard enough, they can come up with something in their life that they should not have done. If you can,then you were one who survived the error of your ways. Learn from what happened here and pray that his extended family may experience comfort from our heavenly father. Remember that hindsight is always 20/20."
439891,tightline,2010-03-04 22:44:00,322,"Is Idiot the right term to throw at a guy who just died...for all you guys know he may have family on the board...a little respect never hurt anyone..  It also states that he has read plenty of books and has done this kind of thing before...I just think because it may be out of your comfort zone to try this kind of thing doesn't make it ridiculous for other people...As much as we all love to believe were the great outdoorsman some people out there really are smarter then you...  You never hear anybody bash the guy who goes through the ice in his 4x4 truck and dies?? Isn't that really just as dangerous??  C'mon bash the dead, really???"
439895,archie_james_c,2010-03-04 22:48:00,618,"  I don't think that it is rediculous that he did that. I know lots of people who are experienced enough that they can safely go into the bush alone for extended periods of time...I'm not ""bashing"" him because of that.  What I think is rediculous is the fact that he should have known his limitations and planned his trips around them accordingly. But he thought the bush was something he could play with like a toy, and now he has ruined his families life because of it....  Shame on him for being so selfish."
439896,solopaddler,2010-03-04 22:49:00,8605," You would never see me slagging someone who just died tragically, personally I would have a little more decorum.    I'd be happy to oblige.  You're buddy seems a little young and more than a little immature. Any comments directed at him had absolutely nothing to do with the tragic incident and everything to do with his own misguided comments and opinions."
439898,splashhopper,2010-03-04 22:55:00,2931,  Hope you take lots of pics and give us a report... that sounds like a trip of a lifetime to guy like me in Southwestern Ontario
439901,archie_james_c,2010-03-04 22:57:00,618,  Agreed that he did come off a little crude in how he said it...
439903,tightline,2010-03-04 22:59:00,322,here's a little more updated and informative article http://news.sympatico.ca/Canada/ContentPos...&date=False
439921,Cookslav,2010-03-04 23:19:00,1457,"I read this as well. Its a sad story regardless of how you slice it. I can't say I'd call him an idiot though...thats pretty harsh.  To suggest he had it comming is also pretty harsh IMO. He was apparently under prepared, overly enthusiastic, and grossly misjudged the challenge ahead. We don't know this gentlmans situation, but it sounds like he didn't have a heck of a lot going for him. I'd almost fathem a guess that perhaps he was a bit slow or impeded? Who knows...  He made some heavy mistakes and paid the ultimate price, but to call him an idiot is a bit insensitive dude... Heck IMO riding a motorcycle on the 401 is WAY, WAY more dangerous then a solo trip in the woods with or with a helmut and training. But I wouldn't call a biker and idiot either LOL...."
439931,Terry,2010-03-04 23:31:00,14456,"An idiot, dolt, or dullard is a mentally deficient person, or someone who acts in a self-defeating or significantly counterproductive way."
439932,redneck666,2010-03-04 23:31:00,563,"Hey, you gotta remember now. these southern ontario folks are perfect! they nor their childen do no wrong!....."
439934,smally21,2010-03-04 23:35:00,993,"i dont disagree with anything anyone has said on this thread but it is a shame i have to sort thru so many lectures to get to actual comments and worthwhile additions to the original thread.  we had a local guy go missing on a fishing trip last year.  just a big mystery, all searches turned up nothing.  it was months i beleive until he was found, deceased im afraid, these incidents are usually classed death by misadventure.  sometimes you bite off more than you can chew, and like some people have said, sometimes you just get bit."
439943,ADB,2010-03-04 23:44:00,444," Looks like that was him, Cudz.  Check out this article, there is a picture of him: http://news.sympatico.ca/Canada/ContentPos...&date=False  Also, it also says, ""A member of the Airport Christian Fellowship church, Code played guitar as a hobby and tried writing music himself.""  Just as you described..."
439944,tightline,2010-03-04 23:48:00,322, What is that suppose to mean??  Now common courtesy or respect is a north/south thing...Always like to believe its a human thing!!
439947,solopaddler,2010-03-04 23:57:00,8605, Us southern folk are far from perfect but at least we're mostly literate.
439948,redneck666,2010-03-04 23:58:00,563," what is that supposed to mean? i lived down there for about 12 years.... went to school down there. pretty well raised down there. i never liked any of the other kids nor their parents. they were stuck up (child and parent) and usually when there was a conflict they thought they were ""perfect"". and yes to answer your questions i DID grow up with the younger generation, so i have seen and been put in situations with ""perfect"" children and parents. if half the people on here werent so obsessed with that fact, they too would be saying what this guy did was idiotic. not trying to be ignorant by any means. just defending mine and some one else's opinion.  now im not saying ALL southern ontario folks are like this BUT a vast majority are!  And yes, ""common courtesy or respect"" is a north/south thing.  JP"
439953,pike slayer,2010-03-05 00:07:00,1177,"solopaddler-i'm to the point on things and very forward. im sure others were thinking the exact same thing ""idiot"" just didnt want to say it. i'm sorry if i didnt ""butter up"" my post, that doesn't make me immature and you continuing on this and flaming me is immature. I've been on here long enough to notice that if someone thinks a little different then they get singled out and thats just wrong. just because solopaddler or drifter can manage in the bush for long periods of time doesnt mean the next guy is capable of doing it. People need to know their limits, it says he tried to do this around xmas time and basically failed, theres your sign. I think people need to lighten up a bit and just go have some fun once in a while. on a bit of a side note, why do yous prefer to go alone? i personally enjoy company of others and i always have multiple people wanting to go with this immature child."
439958,redneck666,2010-03-05 00:15:00,563," LOL, ya! im still waiting to see if this guy lives up to what he says or if he's just ""Bull'ing"" me haha.  chat censor.... Bull isnt THAT bad. lol"
439964,tightline,2010-03-05 00:26:00,322," Thats maybe the craziest thing I have ever heard...the vast majority of southern ontario people are stuck up southern snobs with perfect children???? I've lived here 35 years now and I'm gonna have to disagree...Just the fact you try to generalize people by global positioning tells me that responding to this is a waste of time...lol...really, I'm curious where is the border, how far enough north do I have to go before I'm considered respectable, clearly you chaps haven't made it there yet  When has disrespecting the dead ever been cool???"
439966,xeon,2010-03-05 00:28:00,350,I think this has gotten pretty personal because one of their own (*S.O. city slicker idiot) has been taken from them.
439967,redneck666,2010-03-05 00:31:00,563,"this is getting outta hand. again you are yet another ""perfect"" being. im not generalizing ALL southern ontario folks, like i said. a vast majority. if you knew your vocabulary you would know what i mean.  enough said."
439701,bigfish1965,2010-03-04 16:10:00,3382,http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/77...koka-wilderness   Sad for the family. Sometimes the 'Don't try this at home' warning is far more significant than others.
439708,bassjnkie,2010-03-04 16:19:00,1101,"Very sad. like you said there's a reason they say, ""Don't try this at home""."
439717,Nemo,2010-03-04 16:43:00,727,Heard this story this morning.  Sad indeed. It says he had a lighter. Not sure what he had in the way of food.  I am not sure how he succumbed to hypothermia.  Unfortunate tragedy for his family and friends.
439733,Harrison,2010-03-04 17:17:00,2202,Very sad indeed.  I slipped one year into a rocky ravine while moose hunting and knocked myself out.  If I was alone I probably wouldn't be here today.
439744,camillj,2010-03-04 17:36:00,1988,Terribly sad ... and just when I was planning a little excursion into that area for some backwoods specks ... jeeze ... makes you really stop and remember how quickly things can go wrong.
439753,TJQ,2010-03-04 17:49:00,7806,"It is sad.  Every time you set foot in the bush, there are risks involved no matter how well prepared you are.  Especially when you are hoping for an ""adventure""  sometimes ya get more than ya bargained for,  It's human nature and its life.  I'm sad for this individuals family.  I'm sure he never intended for something like this to happen. Nobody ever does.  Going solo has even more risks."
439756,pike slayer,2010-03-04 18:01:00,1177,im sorry but this guy is an idiot!! zero common sense!! if he had any he'd know better! i feel sorry for the family seesh
439783,brifishrgy,2010-03-04 18:50:00,559,  tell us how you really feel  people go out solo all the time .. winter trips .. canoeing .. hiking .. fishing .. just because he wanted to try survival doesnt make him an idiot .. he informed people where he was in case he didnt make it back .. calling him inexperienced would be more fitting then calling him an idiot
439785,Syn,2010-03-04 18:54:00,519,I feel sorry for the guy but he was well aware of the risks. Wonder if a cell phone could have saved his life (assuming reception works).
439789,pike slayer,2010-03-04 19:05:00,1177,"i feel he should have not gone alone, thats the first thing on the check list before going into the wilderness, always have a buddy!! i never go fishing, hunting, sledding,etc alone. its just the smart thing to do. something simple as a wrong step and you have a broken ankle and your done for even for someone that has taken many trips like survivorman. there was a little to much monkey see monkey do here, should have known better. survivorman shows you what to do if you get put in that situation and to not purposely put yourself into that situation."
439795,tightline,2010-03-04 19:15:00,322,"This is a terrible story...for anyone to call this guy an idiot is just inconsiderate to his family...I think he went out with a plan and his plan failed and for that he paid the ultimate price...You shouldn't judge people by your standards for they don't apply to everyone  My thoughts and prayers go out to the family, to everyone else be safe, be smart"
439799,Spiel,2010-03-04 19:19:00,9065," Considering many of the posts you've made here the only thing that comes to mind, childish as it may seem is, ""takes one to know one."""
439801,pike slayer,2010-03-04 19:22:00,1177,ya i maybe an idiot and do dumb things but common sense kicks in every once in a while and you dont want to be playing with mother nature like this guy did. you wouldnt catch me out there alone but you may catch me doing something dumb with some buddies
439802,solopaddler,2010-03-04 19:30:00,8605," You know that jury duty you were whining about? You won't need any underhanded tactics to get rejected. Just be yourself, you'll be fine.    You've got a lot to learn kid. I've spent months alone in the wilderness. Yes there's risk involved but in my eyes I take more of a risk every time I drive on the QEW. Properly prepared with the correct mind set and skills and it's very safe."
439804,Spiel,2010-03-04 19:36:00,9065," I won't hold my breath waiting to see it.  My condolences to his family, a terrible loss."
439810,Sudzy,2010-03-04 19:57:00,88,Very sad to hear...  I wonder what the details were? How deep was he into woods? did he get injured and not make it out?
439820,NAW,2010-03-04 20:16:00,4022,"I've been following this closely.  Each new article says something a little different.  One really messed up thing about the situation though - He tried the same thing earlier this winter around Christmas time.  According to family members, he nearly died of hypothermia that time, but was able to get out of the wood alive.  He said the wood was to wet to burn, so he couldn’t start a fire. I guess he didn't learn from his past bad experience.  As an avid outdoorsman, and volunteer SAR tech, I really feel for his family and friends.  He definitely does NOT sound like an idiot, but maybe should have planned things a little better.   EDIT:  from all the reports I've read, there aprears to be no signs of fowel play.  All signs point toward hypothermia.."
439840,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-04 21:07:00,10439,"  You said it Mike. If I were to wait around for a ""buddy"" to come along every time I wanted to go sledding, hunting or fishing I would only get out once or twice a year. Being prepared & having common sense are most important. Most of my trips are solo trips and if you use your head and have some basic suppies and survival skills you should come out ok. Crap does happen though and you should be aware of this. Always let someone know where you are going and when you expect to be back (like this unfortunate fellow did) so that if there is an issue help may come in time. I have a 10 day winter camping and snowmobile trip planned for later this month and have all my plans laid out and even including talking with the CO's about ice conditions and trouble spots to avoid. This kind of pre-planning can be the difference between a trip of a lifetime and driving your snowmobile into 1000' of water because of a high current area. I was surprised to find out about 3 dangerous ice areas on the route. It amazes me that in one spot ther is 4 to 5 feet of ice and a couple of hundred yards away it's open water. And this is a lake, not a river.  Are there risks? Yep, but being informed and prepared minimizes the risks."
439845,pike slayer,2010-03-04 21:18:00,1177,"bahaha bahaha! i cant even touch this, this is just going to go nowhere good fast!"
439846,uglyfish,2010-03-04 21:20:00,981,"  had he tried it at home.. he prolly would have been ok!! lol  in all seriousness though, the guy died doin somethin he loved to do. this wasnt his first survival trip out in the wilderness. he just tried to beat the odds and the odds beat him."
439854,fishermccann,2010-03-04 21:27:00,655,"What, was he killed by a chicken."

439864,Dutchy,2010-03-04 21:50:00,416, That made me laugh..............
439868,Cudz,2010-03-04 22:00:00,2652,Wow!  I wonder if this is the same guy I gave a ride to in the summer.  I picked up a hitch hiker in Barrie and he said he was a survival guy.  He didn't seem to have much in the way of provisions and it was really raining hard.  I was on my way fishing so he showed me his fishig lures.  Some really big plastic worms and big hooks and some line.  I stopped the car and hooked him up with the rest of my gulp fish fry and some good quality smaller octopus hooks and some drop shot weights.  I taught him how to rig a drop shot and told him what to do.  He was very thankful. I wasn't going as far as Orillia but it was raining so hard I decided to drive him to there anyway.  We got to talking and he said he was a singer songwriter and just did odd jobs to help people out.  He said he did more christian or gospel type music.  He too was travelling up to Huntsville area and said he had done a few trips like this before.  I really didn't think he was prepared for the weather even in the summer when I picked him up. He didn't even have waterproof boots.  Wonder if this is the same guy?  He had glasses on this summer.
439870,archie_james_c,2010-03-04 22:08:00,618,Sounds like a top notch survival expert...
