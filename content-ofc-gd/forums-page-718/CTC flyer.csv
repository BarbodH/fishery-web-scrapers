440419,Cudz,2010-03-06 00:53:00,2652,There was a nice abu garcia combo as well in Barrie. I bought a portable colour Eagle fishfinder at half price and I also bought an Abu Garcia 503 ALBi for half price. I bought the real from Midland but the Fish finder from Barrie.
440424,Radnine,2010-03-06 00:58:00,1538,"  Isn't there normally a bunch of screaming after the BPS sale as well? Speaking of good prices, has anyone ever cracked a LeBaron catalogue? Jim"
440425,irishfield,2010-03-06 01:00:00,26272,Yep.. it's on sale for a reason Jim.. they don't won't to store it until next year. 1/2 price is 1/2 price for the left overs at season end... if you can take advantage of it great.. if you can't you probably didn't need it anyhow..
440495,torco,2010-03-06 02:26:00,656,"The store in guelph didn't have a tonne of stuff but I managed to get some rapalas and wally divers, etc for 30-50% so I am happy. Spent 40 bucks instead of close to 80. That said no ice fishing stuff but they still had good stock on a lot of it. Hopefully it goes on sale soon."
440509,xeon,2010-03-06 03:02:00,350,The SSM sale sucks too.
440533,Dano,2010-03-06 03:48:00,719," Gosh those floater suits are ugly, who in their right mind would be caught wear.........nevermind  "
440537,Hooked,2010-03-06 03:54:00,891,"  Wow, that's not bad really.  I stopped by the one in Grimsby, it sucked large.  Had some fillet knives and some other crap at 50%, didn't see any lures or reels on sale.  Appears each CTC will have their own specially selected items on sale.  I know the one on Hamilton mountain use to have good things on sale, perhaps I'll check that one out tomorrow.  Not that I need anymore lures, but if they are 50% off, I am forced to buy them."
440542,irishfield,2010-03-06 04:01:00,26272,    Hey.. mines' a Mustang.. not some CTC 1/2 price item bud!
440547,Radnine,2010-03-06 04:06:00,1538," Scaly skin, slimy and fishy smelling, bulging opaque eyes, and look at the Pickerel! Ugly suit or no, that is a hell of a walleye. Wow! Jim"
440556,vinnimon,2010-03-06 04:17:00,2593,The grimsby store always had better sales and still do.
440577,jjcanoe,2010-03-06 06:07:00,744,"Wow, London has the most expensive gas in SW Ont. but the best fishing stuff on sale (according to all these posts)    At the London East store I bought them out of Buzz frogs @ $2 a pack $5.99 or more reg. price, also picked up a soft sided 4 tray plano tackle bag @ $9.99,   Berkley Glup Alive tubs (selected colours) $11.49!!!!!! reg$19.99 London East is cleaned out  (thank you CTC card!) but they still had stuff @ Wonderland and White Oaks stores!  jjcanoe"
440667,GBW,2010-03-06 17:12:00,8460,"Whitby North is almost sold out as I was just there.  I asked the MGR about the ice fishing sale and he said it's not happening this year as they had great sales numbers on ice fishing this year.  Also, no gas augers to be found...  They had 25 factory refurbished jiffy aurgers at the start of the season and were all gone by mid Jan."
440674,ketchenany,2010-03-06 17:20:00,3229,"  A guy with a ""big wally"""
440680,Radnine,2010-03-06 17:38:00,1538,"Just got back from the Caledonia store. Not much fishing stuff on sale (despite a hand written sign claiming otherwise). I did get a package of 25 Slow Death hooks for 2.50 or something. Has anyone had any success with these things, or did I just get hooked? On another note, I bought three of this little 41/2"" angle grinders for the shop at school, for 17.99 each!! A door crasher special at our store only. I know these things are not heavy duty enough for industrial use, but they work fantastically well in a school setting. Just me doing my bit to give you guys the best bang for your education buck Jim"
440693,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-03-06 18:11:00,1107,Well I have to agree it was a bit disappointing not much on sale but i did get a nice plano box for $9.99 which holds a tonne of spinnerbaits and soft plastics it will be handy when river fishing for bass and gators but I did notice that A LOT of there stuff is $2-3 more than anywhere else even wally worlds prices are much better for lures and soft plastics couldn't believe the differance .    
440717,bucktail,2010-03-06 21:37:00,1857,The Burlington Harvester Store had berkely Max on sale and  acouple kiddy rod and reels and one pair of pliers.....WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!  Then they didnt have the spark plugs I needed or the oil.....wasted my trip...what a joke.
440782,troutboy,2010-03-07 00:56:00,125,"Not worth going,I spent 30mins driving to cantire and the only thing 50% off was a relly crappy fly rod!"
439949,GBW,2010-03-05 00:03:00,8460,Just and FYI folks the CTC flyer came today and the 1/2 price sale on fishing gear starts tomorrow.
439956,irishfield,2010-03-05 00:10:00,26272,Told yah it had to be coming soon!! LOL   ..now to find stores that have stuff in stock! I can hear the crying and whining already...
439974,Fisherman,2010-03-05 00:39:00,7201,"Ya, 1/2 price off nothing in stock means they won't have a great loss."
439979,ketchenany,2010-03-05 00:46:00,3229,"I have close connections to the Bowmanville store if I can help!  GBW my connection lives down the street from you! I'm going to drag my    out there sometime soon, but he keeps coming here to eat!"
439983,GBW,2010-03-05 00:47:00,8460,I recall as you told me when I was looking to buy something there before.  I need a 2hp gas auger...
439989,irishfield,2010-03-05 01:00:00,26272,Nothing in my Thursday Paper about fishing stuff. Normal CTC weekly flyer.... maybe the fishing one will come tomorrow. Nothing showing on line either...  Anything of interest??? Last year I went in the night before to get Terry's auger for him.. .already price changed in the cash register...
440002,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-05 01:15:00,2690,This sale doesn't specify ice fishing...just says selected fishing items at 50 % off.
440066,irishfield,2010-03-05 03:31:00,26272,Okay.. I found the little corner of the flyer with fishing equipment. Guess no huts or power augers this year...considering it states Reg 2.49 to $349.99...  Poking through the pages online..  Looks like float suits are on 1/2 price  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/Sp...5252BSilver.jsp
440160,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-05 13:24:00,2690,"Not really what we were expecting...maybe the ice stuff will go on sale next week???  They also have 40% off ""selected"" marine, nothing thrilling there either."
440167,skeeter,2010-03-05 13:49:00,1907,Irishfield is right. there is nothing in the paper flyer about fishing. but on line there is a small add with no details.  which means they only have 1 item on for 50% off but its out of stock--LOL
440170,GBW,2010-03-05 13:56:00,8460,"There is, right in the very middle of the flyer in the top right corner.  it's how I found it to post about it.  the flyer I got had a ""clearance"" insert so if you didn't get that then I understand why you didn't see it.  no, I don't work for CTC..."
440203,torco,2010-03-05 15:14:00,656,I'll stop by local CTC after work since its on the way home but I agree with you guys somehow these sales always disappoint.
440204,irishfield,2010-03-05 15:19:00,26272,"I wouldn't say they always disappoint torco.... So far I've got a 2 man Trekker hut at 1/2 price.. a 2HP jiffy 9"" lightning auger at 1/2 price. Last year a 3HP x 10"" auger for Terry at 1/2 price..."
440211,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-05 15:36:00,2690,"Agreed, CT can still be a great place to get good deals...I was hoping for an auger, as part of this sale...unfortunately not this week...the ice sale could still be coming, fingers crossed.  How do you feel about your Trekker hut?"
440225,archer379,2010-03-05 16:29:00,277,just stopped by the southend store in peterborough only thing i saw was a couple of rods nothing on anything else
440230,MSBruno,2010-03-05 16:50:00,369,"I went by mine and saw a rod, 3 lines, soft tackle box and a couple of older baits on sale.  VERY dissapointed"
440246,irishfield,2010-03-05 17:32:00,26272," I'm happy with it. Third season now on it. Has a couple small holes in the hull.. but up high on the nose from hitting brush etc from going through portages and running 350 miles in some pretty tough lake conditions last March. I'd like a deeper sleigh.. but then again that's just more weight! Quick and easy to set up.. and take down. Probably 2 minutes to pack it up and move to the next spot.  Watch though... CTC is now selling the ""adventurer"".. in place of the true Trekker II. The adventurer comes with camp chairs... instead of the solid fold down seats of the Trekker.. and apparently no stretcher bars. If you get a 50% deal though don't hesitate to grab one (I will be for my neighbour at the lake).. the stretcher bars are easy to make... and many like sitting in lawn chairs vs the solid seats anyhow."
440248,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-05 17:34:00,10439,I'm sure this is not the end of season ice fishing sale. It should be on before the end of the month though. Keep your eyes open.
440275,torco,2010-03-05 19:10:00,656,  I am jealous those are good deals. I never seem to get any of those but I will be on the look out this year. Perhaps in the past I have got there late and everything good is gone.
440279,Terry,2010-03-05 19:23:00,14456,this is only a 50% off some rods and fishing items the good sale is yet to come
440282,mgrieve,2010-03-05 19:32:00,20,"I went by at lunch. It is only rod/reel combo's and they had one rod/reel on sale -Everything else is normal price.  Better to go up to Bass Pro or your local and pick up a better deal!  The ad is misleading!  But then again, it did bring my into the store, and I did end up spending $150 on stuff I probably don't need."
440284,irishfield,2010-03-05 19:38:00,26272,"  Yes it's yet to come as Terry says. Talked to the store owner today in Midland.. just a select few items on sale this week to draw people in. The lost leader sale so to speak.  I actually went to see him over it being ""summer"" in the store already.... I wanted a sled part!"
440294,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-05 20:24:00,4399,"The Orangeville store had nothing fishing related on sale and the Milton store had a few items, but nothing spectacular."
440408,Fisherpete,2010-03-06 00:43:00,1814,"I went to one of the CT stores today, wondering the same thing about the sale... and saw 1/2 price floater suits, but nothing else in the ice fishing section was on sale. I went to customer service and had one of the managers look on the computer at some of the ice fishing stuff to see if they would be on sale - he could not find anything..."
440414,irishfield,2010-03-06 00:46:00,26272,"Was kids rod combos .. you know superman, barbie etc... line cutters/pliers.. some old line and the shimano 2500/3000 combo spinning rod/reels... nothing else."
