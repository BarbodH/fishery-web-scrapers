440712,scugpg,2010-03-06 20:41:00,1373,Hi all - I'm struggling to decide whether to get regular rain pants or go with bibs for my spring-fall rain gear. Just wondering what you guys use and why you prefer either.
440713,bassjnkie,2010-03-06 20:45:00,1101,"I've always used bib pants, rain gear or hunting clothes. I find them more comfortable. Just my opinion. Actually I in the market for a new pair."
440714,glen,2010-03-06 20:51:00,2641,I carry pants in the boat all the time.  If it starts to rain i can put them on quick.  With the bibs you have to take your jacket off first and i don't like that.
440715,scugpg,2010-03-06 21:04:00,1373,One of my concerns is that last year using rainpants I found my back would get cold if the wind would blow up my back. With bibs I see this as a much lesser issue.  Good point on the coat!
440726,hirk,2010-03-06 22:43:00,571,If you get bibs make sure you can easily have a leak:)
440733,fish-miester,2010-03-06 23:04:00,864,i preffer bibs over pants when it comes to snow pants or rain pants.. yes pants can be easier just to throw on.. but you can allways just roll them down if ur in that much of a hurry.. tho i HATE when my snow pants or rain pants slowly fall down when your walking or for any other reasons even if they are as tight as they go and are a good fit.. and thats why i preffer bibs as the straps hold them in place.  as well when your fishing and or have your back to the wind bibs protect you and keep you warmer and dryer! but thats me.. others may have other oppinions
440817,backbay,2010-03-07 02:01:00,773,What he said. There are a lot of times I'll wear the bib whether it's raining or not because they block the wind so well.
440819,trapshooter,2010-03-07 02:06:00,1234,I vote Bibs.  I absolutely love my mine and will never go back to the pant style.
