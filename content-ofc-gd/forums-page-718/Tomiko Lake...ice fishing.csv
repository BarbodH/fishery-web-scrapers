440317,bow slayer,2010-03-05 21:45:00,1074,any opinions from anyone who has knowledge ice fishing this lake? Also does it have a longer season than Nipissing? thanks.
440319,TJQ,2010-03-05 21:49:00,7806,I have heard the fishings been pretty good up there from one of my lodge clients... www.okimot.com
440351,Muskieman,2010-03-05 23:25:00,2472,It's a rather small lake ... my buddy drives his truck all over the lake ... does well at dusk for the big eyes. I haven't went this year ... but did very good last year. Division 11 ...closes 3rd Sunday in March.  RFS 
440357,irishfield,2010-03-05 23:39:00,26272,Not that small Randy.... Lot of points.. a few islands and structure..    
440377,Muskieman,2010-03-06 00:10:00,2472,"  The best fishing spot is in the first picture.  If I'm not mistaken.. pic#1 is Tomiko #2 is Chebogomog ""Chebogan"" and the south end of Tomiko and the Tomiko River.   RFS "
440379,irishfield,2010-03-06 00:13:00,26272,"Unaware that it's two lakes (only has one name on my flight map).. the second shot is just the west end of the first picture.. heading down to the outlet dam..  I'd be fishng the point, about the middle of the first picture"

440396,Muskieman,2010-03-06 00:30:00,2472,"Irish...  You're so close to the ""Hot Spot"" It's not even funny..   Where the narrow is on the south end of the first picture is "" Moose Point"" the separation of the two lakes..  My PB Walleye is from that very spot....  33 3/4  14.7lbs RFS "
440398,irishfield,2010-03-06 00:32:00,26272,Thanks Terry.. dam goes out at the end of the narrow section that has Tomiko Lake over it..  I'd still be fishing that point or Island in the east end..  ..next time I fly over it on a calm day I may just drop in !
440538,johndox,2010-03-06 03:56:00,54,We have been going to Nippising for years on our annual ice fishing trip and thought we would try something new this year so I arranged a trip to Tomiko lake for last weekend for 20 of us. We got an ice fishing package at an outfitter and between the 20 of the bill was over $3000 and we never caught a thing but  2 lings. 4 of us went in mid January to check out the accomadations etc and fished all weeekend for 1 small walleye and a crappie. Talked to the locals and they all say it a great place to summer fish so it sounds like its not even a case of should have been here last weekend or next weekend it sounds like we were six months too late or early. If im not mistaken I think they told me the lake was 4300 acres. So much for the theory the farther you drive the better the fishing. Ive got 20 guys that would say Lake Tomiko sucks and would never return for ice fishing.
440546,irishfield,2010-03-06 04:05:00,26272,I'm sure there was at least a $150 per person of laughs over the weekend... no??
440564,johndox,2010-03-06 04:46:00,54,"oh definitely lots of laughs and I have the pictures to prove it,but you can have them and catch fish too cant you??"
440567,Fish Farmer,2010-03-06 04:50:00,2234,Every time I think of the narrows there makes me remember it cost me $2500.00 for a new bottom end on my 115  Thanks for reminding me  .
