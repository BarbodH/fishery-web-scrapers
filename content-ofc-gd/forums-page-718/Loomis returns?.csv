I've dealt with them twice now once for a fronteir rod that they don't warranty any more which they were very appoligetic about but didn't take the sting of busting a $700 rod and the other was flawless got my new rod in a week or so.

Don't know if Loomis Canada would replace it or not, it is a discontinued rod from what I read online.  The rod isn't broken thou, and I don't have the $75, lol right now.  Thats why I asked if it costs to have it sent in."
