440194,Billy Bob,2010-03-05 14:59:00,5865,I fish Chautauqua Lake each year for crappies and I can bet my last jig that I can launch my boat on a ice free Chautauqua Lake by April 1st every year....I once had my boat fishing walleye and crappie on March 13th many years ago (must of been a global warming year...LOL) as our walleye season is open until March 15th every year.  So what would you guess or depend on to get that boat back into the water ?  ?  ?   Bob  BTW do you think I'm ready for some soft water action..

440213,TDunn,2010-03-05 15:43:00,680,"I'll be in a boat tomorrow! Can't wait!   Dara is right, our inlands have quiet awhile still.....   TDunn"
