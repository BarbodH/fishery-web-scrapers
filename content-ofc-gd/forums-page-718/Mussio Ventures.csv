I would primarily be interested in the smaller lesser know lakes sorta off the beaten path.  Just wondering if anybody has any experience/opinions on above mentioned books before I drop the cash.  Thanks"

Both are worth the money, the backroads map book has all the camp spots and acess's to back lakes. The lake book contains only the larger lakes in the area, with stocking charts and species. Your best bet is getting some maps of the area from the mnr in town. They are very friendly and willing to print off stocking charts and maps. If you want I know of some beautiful spots up here to paddle and camp, with great fishing."

However, I have never used them for actual navigation in the wilderness.  They also have folding maps that might be better suited for your needs.   I don't think I have seen any other companies that provide a similar product at the local sporting/outdoors stores in the GTA.  I'd imagine with GPS's being so popular there is a limited market.  I think if you're going off the beaten path you might consider a GPS in addition to a map.   They are very much worth it and the batteries do last a long time (at least in my Garmin)."
