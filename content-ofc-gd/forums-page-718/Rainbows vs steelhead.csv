440771,Twocoda,2010-03-07 00:37:00,4130,"  so wouldnt ""central salmon"" be a more appropriate name as opposed to"" atlantic salmon"" for the freshwater self sustaining fish ?? (above Niagra)"
440832,danjang,2010-03-07 02:29:00,148," Sure! The thing is, taxonomy isn't perfect. When two populations diverge enough to have separate subspecies is really what the general consensus is. If a taxonomist writes a paper to advocate for the central salmon and most people agree, a new subspecies arises. But this is fairly rare. Take a look at dogs. Chihuahuas and great danes are completely different. One's a real dog and the other... a rat but its all the same thing."
440900,carll2,2010-03-07 04:44:00,443,"id have to say its possible that a lake ontario salmon or rainbow migrates far, as an example certain places around here in montreal in the fall catch some salmon and steelhead....anything is possible"
439839,troutologist,2010-03-04 21:07:00,951,It was my way of thinking that browns were a true trout despite the being in the genus Salmo.  The way fish are arranged into the genera Salmo and Oncorhynchus are based on evolutionary similarity to common ancestors.
439841,Dutchy,2010-03-04 21:08:00,416," Sort of. Oncorhynchus. Its a terminal node. But Coho and everything else, cutthroat trout all fall under it too. They are all Salmonidae.  Origin of many fish is tough to figure out for example:  ""Main conclusions Using mtDNA and nuclear DNA analysis it was concluded, that the Adriatic 'sea trout' belong to species S. trutta and is most likely derived from hatchery-reared brown trout population.""  If anyone is really interested in rainbows, read this: http://www.isu.edu/~keelerne/fr10parkinson.pdf  Conserving Genetic Diversity in Rainbow Trout"
439961,aniceguy,2010-03-05 00:20:00,1094,"Dutchy thanks for that link are you in a genetics lab out that way, if so I have some work for ya....., Im sitting here on the fence on this one maybe have another beer too while im at it.  but clofchik I copied your text in different sizes so its defined  I don't know if you haven't had the first coffee in the morning, if you've drunk some funny tasting Kool-Aid, or the rabies from the wolf bite has moved to it's final stage and your brains are slowly being broiled in a fevered delerium. To get the level of Atlantics in St.Mary's on one river would need the complete elimination of every other fishery in Lake O. No chinooks, no steelhead, no browns, no lakers, nothing. All to get 40,000 stocking dependent Atlantics in one river system. Do you have proof to support that comment???????  Atlantics spawning successfully in the Great Lakes is nil. Successful adult returns for fish stocked as fry & smolts is nil. The only returning adults in any fishable numbers were stocked as yearlings. The amount of resources it takes to collect, hatch, feed & raise an Atlantic is exponential compared to every other specie currently being stocked.  Again so this doesn’t go down some wayward path your proof on the matter above was????? Swim up fry have been evidenced. Please fish the upper Credit and the Atlantic Parr are like vermin they are so plentiful and some financial numbers to back up the latter would be very interesting to see also the vast majority of resources are from free volenteers, OFAH and funding from Australia   To get a St.Mary's size of run just in the Credit, would mean an end to every other MNR stocking program on Lake Ontario, for a relatively small off season river fishery, a negligible offshore boat fishery, and a lot of empty water.   Honestly where are you getting this information, as its about as false as a cubic zerconia again some proof on that would be an interesting read as well and who’s money is it thats financing that yearling production or the entire program in fact. I will beg to differ as your napkin must have had some beer spilled on it… actual cost is a fraction, and again its not your money or mine but a third parties for the vast majority and leveraged in kind work  One needs to digress and look back to how long it took to get the chinook program off the ground, here in Lake O.  Like the Atlantics hate the Atlantics regardless sit back all of you and think about how that animal is/can be or might be parlayed to get other work done that might not have been done without its presence or addition to SARA the species at risk legislation.  Need an example, Norval dam has been in the process of getting a new fish bypass since it ceased to operate 20 yrs ago, no where close any program currently could have made that happen in any measurable time frame.  Atlantics knock on the door and thank you salar a ladder is in the final stages of approval and is scheduled for construction this summer and sooner or later other species will have the opportunity to use it, thats one single example I could think of about 20 sitting here.  The various FMP's being written as we speak how are salar opening doors to habitat? Species at Risk funding to do riperian work( money that never would come to any other program ) thanks Mr salar, I can continue to the Atlantic haters what other benefits they are and could potentially hold and lets not talk about the fishery in it, Im only talking the potential millions in a pot to do some great habitat work and who benefits all those other cold water salmonids.  Can someone please demonstrate 1 single negative impact the Salar program has had on the Lake Ontario Fishery....."
439962,John Bacon,2010-03-05 00:22:00,3277," I agree; but I think the same can be said for the terms char and salmon as well.  p.s. I always find it interesting that Brook Trout, Lake Trout, Bull Trout, Dolly Varden Trout, and Artic Char are all members of one genus and everybody keeps saying that the four trout members are really char rather than referring to the one char member as a trout.  Wouldn't in make more sense to say that an arctic char is really a trout?"
440018,CLofchik,2010-03-05 01:48:00,854," Then you should know that Atlantics are not native to Lake Huron, they're an introduced species. And rainbows were introduced & naturalized long before Pacific Salmon were stocked.   What he said.   Well gee, it's not surprising that immature Atlantics are found like vermin where they are stocked. 1)  How many Atlantics have been stocked in the Credit? 2)  How many returning fish have been captured?  That really should be the end of it.  Stocking fry & smolts doesn't work and has been a complete and total waste everywhere it's been done.   Seeing as you are part of a private group that has benefited from being part of the Atlantic salmon program you should know better than anyone how much it costs to raise a yearling Atlantic, and might not be a stretch to say that could be why you're such a fan. It just staggers me when people say words like ""infancy"" & ""getting off the ground"".  We're coming up to 30 years of continous Atlantic stocking, and to celebrate we'll just throw up our hands and say ""No no no, we're a whole NEW program"" and pretend that nothing came before.  Because, well, it has produced nothing in Lake Ontario except the very rare & occasional fish.  Compared to say the Coho fishery in the 70's or Chinook program in the 80's, y'know when those programs were in their infancy?   Now you see, you're getting into the very dangerous political waters of the Atlantics, the bureaucratic doublespeak that infests this program from the top down.  So you're going to support a program of imaginary returning fish that exists only on paper because the funding work will benefit real actual fish.  I'm sorry you're so shortsighted you don't see the dangers with going down that road, as an example how many streams & rivermouths are now off limits for pen projects & other stocking programs because they're earmarked for Atlantic returns that will never happen?   You mean besides the dangers of bureaucratic doublespeak? The end of provincial Chinook & Coho stocking would be a start.  The vast waste of resources when they could have gone toward other proven fish would be another.  Maybe you could answer a question for me, have you thought about what happens when the wine money runs out, what happens then?"
440056,aniceguy,2010-03-05 03:09:00,1094,"Chris mind answering a few questions I posed, talk about double talk, mind answering where you recieved your data, any peer reviewed papaers to support anything your talking about   What evidence do you have or possess that the Atlantics would could or will ever impede the Chinook program??  that’s more in line with the great TV guys fear mongering as we see in your signature again cite some literature that’s peer reviewed that’s credible but without any evidence I don’t think so ....  You are referring to a fisheries management plan re a pen site in cootes paradise as the reason a pen can’t go there for the Chinooks,  Atlantics didn’t preclude that one from happening  please read the FMP it should answer why that site isn’t suitable for a pen project, it had nothing to do with salar  The vast resources never would have gone to anything anywhere.....someone was shopping for a feel good project and a venue to introduce a product....someone saw a program and some money for it  there’s your Atlantic program.  Under no circumstances has this money came from other projects or would it have been there for any other project. Maybe some project in another province, might have seen the pitch for wine introduction and bought it and today the millions of dollars spent in Ontario could have gone to BC to protect an Okanogan sand frog or something so good to see my province and my favorite rivers got the money not BC.  Being part of a PUBLIC group I have seen the direct benefits of this Atlantic program and haven’t seen 1 negative one, sorry I’m waiting for something credible there from you on that part  Check the stocking numbers of the early Chinook program against the early Atlantic program then come back with some info on the early parts of a program  Let’s not even get to shortsighted discussions, a perfect storm with these additional chinooks in the pens could be eating themselves out of house and home and I’m literally going to cry when/if that happens.  I ll wager a few cases of beer on this one...with the advent of these pen sites the fishing off the mouth of the Credit and Bronte will get worse, the blame will be of course the US pen rearing project the MNR and its stocking practice  some loch ness type monster eating them all etc....anything, but in reality the fish are spread apart and are honing in on other natal streams.  Those small low gradient streams in Kingston and past will see some nice returns of Chinooks that never had them thanks to the pens  but it’s just going to be  a short sighted solution to dealing with deplorable over capacity stocking practices  by the MNR , and I ll go as far to wager that the end result will be Harbor chinooks on the Credit that bloat, and there isn’t a run of fish to sustain a hatchery program. Everyone will say it’s this or that but it’s in reality it’s about spreading fish via short sited management directives....  Stock them into the watershed that’s the answer and remove some dams giving them access to proper water Coho's are another demon, truth there is that certain OMNR staff and some hatchery issues with thermal over loading put collection farther and farther back....good on MEA for spearheading it and CRAA for helping to find the fish this year hope to continue that ...  Anyhow to answer your final question,  a genie tells me there is another 5 yrs of money in the pipe, thanks to some deliverables provided in the last two years  anyhow you can email me those links to support your comments on the original posting if you don’t want to post them here"

440176,CLofchik,2010-03-05 14:07:00,854," Um, you mean apart of completely eliminating the MNR chinook stocking program?  Isn't that really enough?   That's one of the management plans that make it clear how support for Atlantics has taken priority over every other sportfish species.  There's three major tribs flowing Hamilton Harbour that all had significant runs of trout & salmon at one time, I'd love to see Chinooks running up Red Hill & Spencers Creek again and the rainbow run up Grindstone back to what it used to be.  However that's not going to happen because all three of those streams are now part of the Atlantic salmon recovery program, so stocking rainbows or Chinooks is now off the table.  The crazy part is in the Hamilton Harbour Management Plan, the future for the next 10 years of sport angling, Atlantics are mentioned 36 times, more than any other specie of fish.  EVEN THOUGH NOT A SINGLE ATLANTIC HAS BEEN STOCKED IN HAMILTON HARBOUR.  Your fishery today has been sold down the river for the dream of possibly having Atlantics tomorrow.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/267125.pdf    What's to email, you should know the score off by heart from your own programs. You raise what, 10,000 yearlings with 150,000ish Atlantic fry put in by the MNR into the Credit every year right? What were your returns last year?  40 adult fish?  Awesome."
440180,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-05 14:17:00,0,"i like how you said that ""numbers"" of atlantics found in the st. mary's could never live along side the pacific salmon, yet in the st. mary's river they successfully live alongside all introduced members of the family.  you obviously hate the atlantic stocking program and you're entitled to your opinion.  that said, you can't back up anything you say."
440181,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-05 14:17:00,2690,"A heck of alot of strong feelings on this issue...personally still think we could spend those license dollars in better ways.  Yes the Atlantic Salmon is a great fish, but, we have enough proven fish already in the great lakes, IMO. We will never...NEVER...recreate the water quality/conditions of the long ago past.  Let's stick with what works now and try to not screw up the fishery that we have.  Is this fisheries progress or regress?"

While it was a funny picture you wearing the tv guys shirt posing on the Credit, and I see yous passion for the nooks, the only reason I got into this thread was to point out your obvious leaps of faith and typing blunders on the program, so please if your going to post facts at the very least make sure they are correct rather then some sort of fear mongering on a program....  species at risk Native, (including re introduction) naturalized fish that how OMNR manages fish under its spof 2 directive.  and any FMP needs to deal with how the MNR wants fisheries driven, some stakeholder input how fish communities are dealt with.

440197,ehg,2010-03-05 15:05:00,2666,"Interesting information contained in this thread.  Steelhead are rainbow trout period. Rainbow trout are a morph from the original Pacific salmon. Thus the Oncorhynchus genera tag. Steelhead are anadromous in the Pacific since they go to saltwater then freshwater to spawn. The stocked great lake steelhead are considered potodramous since they are always in freshwater but retain there steelhead name since they migrate upriver to spawn. Landlocked rainbow trout in inland Ontario lakes are referred to simply as rainbow trout as there is no spawning migration. Whew! So there is Pacific salmon(Oncorhynchus)(includes rainbows), Atlantic salmon(Salmo)(includes brown trout) and char(Salvelinus)(includes lakers, brookies) in North America. According to taxonomists the original trout is the brown(Salmo Trutta). 'Trutta' being latin for trout. Browns have evolved from Atlantic salmon bringing some identification problems here at times. Oddly this thread has been edumacational."

440219,solopaddler,2010-03-05 15:54:00,8605, I touched on this earlier in the thread. By all rights they should be called ouannaniche.  Nothing is suggested. it's a documented fact and a part of history that Atlantics once thrived in Lake O.

440281,danjang,2010-03-05 19:32:00,148, So long as the two populations (oceanic and landlocked) can produce fertile offspring they are considered a single species. They will get a subspecies name to differentiate the two.    True. They were once the mojor salmonid in Lake O.  There is a very cool story about the atlantic I learned about at a genetics lab in the ROM. They have a rare 100 year old skinmount of the ouannaniche. They were taking DNA samples to search for this strain that might have been collected for fish farms in other parts of the world. This strain might still exist somewhere!
440570,StoneFly,2010-03-06 04:57:00,574,"WOW,...Intersting thread...but I wont pretend this debate hasnt been done to death in the past.  Personally, I would love to see a flourishing Atlantic population...Ive only ever experienced these fish on TV from the out east flyfishing to be had...It looks absolutely amazing to me,....the strength of chinooks and acrobatics of Steelhead...seems like the perfect river Fish.  Not too mention if they did take they would fill in that summer gap we have for river fishing.  Whether the atlantics succeed or not,...if money is going into improving habitat that otherwise wouldnt happen...by all means,..this is a GREAT thing IMO!!!  If we dropped Nooks altogether and allowed Coho, Steelhead and Browns more space and effort,..I think most River fisherman and possibly the downrigger guys would be quite happy.  Don't get me wrong,..the nookies are fun and all,..but if they were gone, so would many of the problems the rivers have.  ie., the number of anglers and snagging and garbage etc etc.  Personally I hope the Atlantics take and floursih,..however if they dont and the other prized species benefit through wild population increases,...GIDDY UP!!!  P.s,..all the debate over the proper names,..Get a grip...lol,..who cares???"
440582,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-06 08:49:00,158,"clofchik aounds a lot like Cronzy, thats not an insult, just sayin'.  He sure rants a lot about this issue.  The debate about salmonid names and what not, its all been settled, they are all in the salmon family, three different genera.  If you really want to get confused start researching about all the other rainbow trout offshoots in the Rockies and throughout the States.  Another time another place.  The first thing anyone should note about Lake Ontario is it is not the same lake it was before we came and messed it all up.  Thanks to overfishing, habitat degredation and destruction, and the introduction of the sea lamprey via the St. Lawerence Seaway.  Then we decided we needed new fishing opportunities and introduced several pacific salmon and the brown trout.  The rivers have all been damned, rerouted, polluted and degraded in one way or another.  So even if we had the atlantic salmon of yesteryear to reintroduce, would they take?  Thats the best part though. We don't have the proper atlantics to reintroduce.  The MNR has got pretty good over the years at maching stocked fish with the intended recieving waters.  What i mean is that they choose fish that come from similar habitats. Within any species there are populations from different areas/regions that have already diverged in terms of evolution to adapt to their local environment.  I think everyone can agree that a lake trout from Great Slave Lake in the NWT is not the same beast as one from Lake Ontario.  So why haven't the MNR done a good match with the Atlantics? I don't know, but they are stocking fish from the east coast and not land locked ones like the ones that used to inhabit he Lake.  Like others pointed out though, there is a lot of private money involved here.  It does appear to be a ""feel good"" project.  It seems as though things were rushed into because money, interest and polical pressure was there.  Also the credit river seems to be one of the main rivers chosen.  Why? Maybe some of the MNR biologists in that District (Aurora) have a personally vested intrest? The Atlantics will have to compete with centrarchids and esox in the credit on top of the rainbows and nooks. Seriously.  Everyone is entitled to their opinions on this, but they should also realize that appearances are decieving.  The more competetive pacific species aren't goin anywhere anytime soon as the Americans will not stop stocking them any time soon.  Money would be better spent improving habitat and managing pacific salmon species, or even lake trout (they survived and are still reproducing).  I would love to catch an Atlantic myself.  I am also a supporter of the MNR and believe the do not get enough funding and resources to opperate to their full potential.  But this project in particular is a political one and not one that is biologically sound.  I do not believe this project has the public's best interest in mind, it is simply a PR project for private money that the MNR got involved for the wrong reasons at the wront time.  It would be nice for a few individuals to claim responsiblity for the Atlantics making return against all odds wouldn't it? The chance at notoriety may have been too much to pass up... Especially when the money and political backing was easy for the taking...  Just playing the devils advocate here.  No solid accusasions, I just like to ask tough questions and have rumours dispelled."

439784,pikeie,2010-03-04 18:52:00,380," The fact is its just not the steelhead that are introduced species! all the salmon species are as well, like the chinooks, cohos and pinks. But most were introduced to help solve another problem.  i could/ have written essays on the salmon in the great lakes, heres a short way of telling a long story. Early in the 19'th century the lake trout fishery was at its peak! Once the numbers of lakers got decimated by over fishing, the Alwife populations sky rocketed! which was a problem because of the numbers of dead and rotting Alwife being washed up on the beaches after winter, known as winter kill. I belive Michigan was the first state to bring up the idea of stocking Pacific salmon into the great lakes. This worked wonders, untill the alwife population decreased to stable levels. soon after the new recreational salmon fishery also started to dwindle. All of the other states/ provinces followed suit and now that is why we have our pacific salmon fishery. I belive the Pink salmon was accendentally released in northern superiour, due to a power outage at a hatchery, they had no choice but to dump the brood stock.  I myself have been lucky enough to go to school in the soo, and to experience a phenomenal atlanitc salmon fishery! Which is pretty much all thanks to LSPU. I have never landed an atlantic... yet, but i have hooked them many ways. and let me tell you, i have never had a fish hit so hard and peel so much line that quick! i have hooked most of them on the fly rod which is a feat in itself! I think it would be very interesting to see an atlantic fishery in the lower great lakes, im sure alot of people would catch on to the thrill of these beautys!  EDIT Yes they are now part of the Pacific Salmon family... Their name in latin is Oncorhynchus mykiss, with Oncorhynchus being the begining of all salmon latin names."
439786,Dozer,2010-03-04 18:54:00,896,"Eh, they are introduced fish that are invading... I should of clarified"
439791,Guest steel'n'esox,2010-03-04 19:09:00,0,"So thats where the ganny steelhead went 18,000 in 89 to 5,000 at present they went to the Atlantic via the St Lawrence swam at night so they wouldnt get eaten by the 40 acre shoal Muskies, and lake of 2 mountains esox and decided to stay there"
439803,solopaddler,2010-03-04 19:33:00,8605, As a matter of fact biologists reclassified them a few years back. They're now officially a salmon.
439805,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-04 19:38:00,2690,"Wow...I missed that one, must have been to busy fishing, lol!!!  So the grocery stores were ahead of their time when they were calling them ""steelhead salmon"" all those years."
439806,Spiel,2010-03-04 19:39:00,9065," That may be so but they'll always be trout in my mind. I'm stubborn. All white mouths and repeat spawning, both things true Pacific salmon lack.  Damn taxonomists...."
439832,dave524,2010-03-04 20:55:00,4508," Trout?? seems to be layman's term , much like we refer to ducks, geese and swans all as waterfowl.  Here we have Rainbows and Cohos in the same genus, so they are salmon.  Likewise , Browns and Atlantics are the same genus , so, I guess they are both salmon too.  Lakers and Specs, we all know they are really char.  Taxonomically speaking, is there really such a thing as a trout?? Any wildlife biologists want to chip in?  As a forester, I got a handle on how all this taxonomic stuff works , but only related to plant material."
439836,Twocoda,2010-03-04 21:05:00,4130, this is going to make for some pretty darn good conversations at the weigh stations.... got a link ? apparently ive got some reading to do ....     i agree...its going to take me years to get used to the thought of catching a steelamon/salmout
439550,vinnimon,2010-03-04 03:13:00,2593,"I know the difference between the 2.One spawns twice and the other once.My question is, Is there any proof that steelhead actually go back to saltwater after spawning?For instance, For lake O tribes, up the st lawerence and out to the atlantic.I know that the bows go back to the lake until the next cycle.Has there been any proof that they go back to saltwater, and return, at all?"
439559,danjang,2010-03-04 03:18:00,148,"Steelhead are migratory whereas rainbows aren't. Doesn't matter whether or not its to the ocean. Great lakes are a special case due to its size, they ""think"" its an ocean. There is sufficient forage fish in the  lakes to sustain yhis."
439561,John Bacon,2010-03-04 03:23:00,3277,All rainbow/steelhead are capable of spawning multiple times in their life.  I don't think there is evidence to suggest that significant numbers of any of the steelhead from lake Onrario end up in the Atlantic.  If they did it is unlikely that they would return.  To do so they would have to pass through the locks.  The term steelhead usually refers to a migratory trout... this would include trout that migrate from Lake Ontario to spawn.  As mentioned they are capable of spawning more than once.  Rainbow trout usually refers to trout that are resident in rivers or small lakes.  They are both the same species though.
439571,vinnimon,2010-03-04 03:40:00,2593,"I would love to see some evidence that proves that, steelhead make their way back to the atlantic and return to Lake O tribe nesting grounds.I know there is a lot a food for these fish to feed on in the great lakes,to keep them happy.But in my mind im thinking there has to be the odd one that makes a full round trip.The chances are slim to none but, its possible."
439579,solopaddler,2010-03-04 03:50:00,8605,  1.What you're suggesting is unfortunately impossible.  2.Steelhead and rainbow trout are genetically identical and both spawn multiple times.
439582,dave524,2010-03-04 03:57:00,4508,"  Maybe not entirely impossible, don't the American Eels make the trip? I know they are not as common as in my youth but I caught one maybe 15 years ago at the mouth of the Forty."
439583,ironstone74,2010-03-04 04:01:00,201,Some rainbow spawn from the same hen are often mixed between Rainbow and Steelhead.  Some stay local to the river and others migrate.  Cool.  Depends on the conditions.
439586,vinnimon,2010-03-04 04:11:00,2593,"I have to agree with dave524 on this one.The possibilities are slim to none, but not entirely impossible. Im sure that all barriers have fish ladders to some degree."
439591,solopaddler,2010-03-04 04:28:00,8605, In theory it's not impossible but the odds of you winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning in the same day are better.
439593,Dozer,2010-03-04 04:29:00,896,"Our steel doesn't migrate into the oceans from what I have gathered, other systems' rainbows do.  Speaking of steel... 6 more hours"
439624,dave524,2010-03-04 11:18:00,4508,"Now that American Eels are on the protected list like sturgeon for Ontario, wonder if some of the impediments between  Lake Ontario and the Atlantic are going to be relieved to aid in their recovery? Saw an article somewhere recently that Steelhead that have been identified as from either Ganny or Credit stock are moving into Atlantic Salmon Rivers in the lower St Lawrence and/or Maritimes, obviously they are moving one way. Has anyone heard of any measures or studies planned to help the American Eel recover?  edit: Any measures could have implications for other species, good and bad."
439630,trevy727,2010-03-04 11:50:00,351,"The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a species of salmonid native to tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America as well as much of the central, western, eastern, and especially the northern portions of the United States.  The species has been introduced for food or sport to at least 45 countries, and every continent except Antarctica. In some locations, such as Southern Europe, Australia and South America, they have negatively impacted upland native fish species, either by eating them, outcompeting them, transmitting contagious diseases, or hybridization with closely-related species and subspecies that are native to western North America  The species was originally named by Johann Julius Walbaum in 1792 based on type specimens from Kamchatka. Richardson named a specimen of this species Salmo gairdneri in 1836, and in 1855, W. P. Gibbons found a population and named it Salmo iridia, later corrected to Salmo irideus, however these names faded once it was determined that Walbaum's type description was conspecific and therefore had precedence (see e.g. Behnke, 1966).[3] More recently, DNA studies showed rainbow trout are genetically closer to Pacific salmon (Onchorhynchus species) than to brown trout (Salmo trutta) or Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar), so the genus was changed.  Unlike the species' former name's epithet iridia (Latin: rainbow), the specific epithet mykiss derives from the local Kamchatkan name 'mykizha'; all of Walbaum's species names were based on Kamchatkan local names.  The ocean going (anadromous) form (including those returning for spawning) are known as steelhead, (Canada and the United States) or ocean trout (Australia), although they are the same species.  Like salmon, steelhead are anadromous: they return to their original hatching ground to spawn. Similar to Atlantic salmon, but unlike their Pacific Oncorhynchus salmonid kin, steelhead are iteroparous and may make several spawning trips between fresh and salt water. The steelhead smolts (immature or young fish) remain in the river for about a year before heading to sea, whereas salmon typically return to the seas as smolts. Different steelhead populations migrate upriver at different times of the year. ""Summer-run steelhead"" migrate between May and October, before their reproductive organs are fully mature. They mature in freshwater before spawning in the spring. Most Columbia River steelhead are ""summer-run"". ""Winter-run steelhead"" mature fully in the ocean before migrating, between November and April, and spawn shortly after returning. The maximum recorded life-span for a rainbow trout is 11 years.[4] Salmon is often sold as a replacement because their similar taste."

439636,solopaddler,2010-03-04 12:11:00,8605,"  A good recap, except our great lakes steelhead aren't anadromous they're potodramous.  And another thing since I'm being such a stickler. The so called atlantic salmon that are being stocked right now will never see the salt. Historically the original ""atlantic salmon"" were potodramous as well never travelling to the sea.  Shouldn't it be called the ouannaniche  restoration program?"
439645,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-04 13:02:00,2690," Should be called the ""total waste of tax money program"" IMO.  Don't think the program will ever take off properly...steelhead are a proven success in our great lakes, but, the ministry in their infinite wisdom is trying to re-create the past."
439646,Spiel,2010-03-04 13:06:00,9065, You have much to learn Grasshopper.
439647,solopaddler,2010-03-04 13:13:00,8605,  Actually the returns have been nothing short of amazing at least in my opinion. Very encouraging.  From what I've seen the powers that be should be encouraged to continue.  We don't have to look very far here in ON to find an already established fishery for atlantics. One that thrives and provides fantastic sport. The mid summer fishery at the St. Mary's rapids in the Soo is nothing short of spectacular. No reason whatsoever we can't enjoy a similar fishery down here.
439648,solopaddler,2010-03-04 13:18:00,8605,"    Now figure out the odds of both happening to you on the same day.   (Side note, but vinnimon pm'd me. He wanted me to pick 4 numbers for the lotto on Fri, he's buying the ticket. This board is great LOL!  )"

439660,CLofchik,2010-03-04 13:55:00,854," I don't know if you haven't had the first coffee in the morning, if you've drunk some funny tasting Kool-Aid, or the rabies from the wolf bite has moved to it's final stage and your brains are slowly being broiled in a fevered delerium. To get the level of Atlantics in St.Mary's on one river would need the complete elimination of every other fishery in Lake O.  No chinooks, no steelhead, no browns, no lakers, nothing.  All to get 40,000 stocking dependent Atlantics in one river system.  Not only are your comments about Atlantics self indulgent pie in the sky daydreaming, but it's the kind of back slapping head in the sand enabling that has rendered the MNR not just irrelevant, but a hostile combatant to the future fisheries of Lake O.  P.S.  Atlantics were never native above Niagara Falls, the only places where they have managed to survive in freshwater they are an invasive species.  Oh the irony."
439671,solopaddler,2010-03-04 14:44:00,8605,  Pretty harsh clofchik.  The steelhead and kings seem to be thriving nicely alongside the atlantics in northern lake Huron. Why exactly would other species need to be eliminated in Lake O?  My comments are based on personal experiences catching these fish in the last couple years. We had a day out east last year where huge numbers were caught. Opened my eyes for sure.  Exactly what are you basing your venomous comments on?  Self indulgent pie in the sky daydreaming? You've got nerve I'll give you that.
439682,torco,2010-03-04 15:09:00,656,Here is an interesting blog link since we are discussing the biology of rainbows and steelhead.  http://flyaddicts.com/flygal/2010/02/19/trout-in-a-new-light/ ://http://flyaddicts.com/flygal/2010/0...n-a-new-light/
439685,CLofchik,2010-03-04 15:30:00,854," Atlantics spawning successfully in the Great Lakes is nil. Successful adult returns for fish stocked as fry & smolts is nil. The only returning adults in any fishable numbers were stocked as yearlings. The amount of resources it takes to collect, hatch, feed & raise an Atlantic is exponential compared to every other specie currently being stocked.  That's the unassailable truth behind every Atlantic program on the Great Lakes.  For the MNR to raise 40,000 yearling Atlantics would require the money & even more valuable hatchery space that's currently used for every other fish stocked in Lake O, which everybody except the MNR recognizes as a stocking dependent fishery. To get a St.Mary's size of run just in the Credit, would mean an end to every other MNR stocking program on Lake Ontario, for a relatively small off season river fishery, a negligible offshore boat fishery, and a lot of empty water.  Back before I became a bitter, disillusioned, venomous old man and still held out some hope of a future for this side of Lake O I put together some fairly intensive back of a napkin cost analysis (that was promptly deleted from floatfishing.net).  It costs in the neighbourhood of $1500 to get a returning mature Atlantic, $1.25 for a King.  That's insane (or once processed through the swivel servant bureaucracy of an Ontario ministry, perfectly reasonable).  The Soo has a small regional fishery that is supported wholly by a private US institution.  Enjoy catching them, but everywhere else there are much much better choices of sportfish.  P.S.  Ooooh I like ""Venomous"".  I didn't quite mean to sound the way it came off, but I'll settle for ""Venomous"""
439689,Dozer,2010-03-04 15:38:00,896,"Thats a lot of money for a yearling to swim down stream, hit the lake and then get attacked by something...  how come it costs $1,500 per fish?  I'm no fish rearing expert, certainly not Atlantics ( haha ), but that does sound like a big number for per fish."
