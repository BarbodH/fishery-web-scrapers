This sounded like something I'd like to try, but that's a long distance for just a day or two of fishing.   So, I started looking around the 1000 Islands area - Alexandria Bay and Clayton.  I can be there in about 8 hours.  Of course, I'm finding quite a few.   Curious if anyone has taken a charter from one of these areas - and what you thought of the trip and the business itself ?  Probably looking at going out for 2 days.   I'm looking at the US side in the hopes of taking a partner with me - just in case they do not have a passport."
