440824,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-07 02:15:00,709,  yeah man thats the same lake.  the fish are verry healthy!  a tresure you say? yep thats why i C & R everything.  trying to keep it that way.  such a fun place to go on the week ends and after work.  20 minutes from home!
440367,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-05 23:57:00,709,"Work is slow these days.  dont bother me at all. today's plan.  ice fishing. who did i bring. my co-worker.  He never iced fish this year and we took the nice day to get him out on the ice.  get on the ice @ 7:30 ish.  the snow and rain that we had Froze, and is now hard packed snow and AWESOME ice. 16'' if ice that is.  I take advantage of the hard ice to try new spots.  Walked across the Whole lake and settle on a hump.  i make like 20 holes and we ge tset up.  and YES AGAIN the first tip-up we put it BOOM!  Sly sets the hook and his first bass on ice ever!    trying to find and set up around the hump was hard. i couldnt find the drops i was looking for.  found one that produced this small pike!    Then this spot went dead..... cant say i didnt try!  The next plan was deadly....... no fish wise i mean leg wise...  walked acrossed the whole lake again! :shock:  what can i say the ice is so perfect and was easy to walk ON.  nothing like last week-end!  Get to the other spot that i wanted to try out... and this is where HELL brakes lose....  while punching the holes the auger runs out of gas! :shock:  was able to dig 4 holes...... so i set up the lines and have a bite to eat.  I remmembered that whitespinnerbait had told me once, engins can run on FUMES.  Crank...*Cranks* *CRANK* SNAP!!!  the cord broke ! :x  guess he was lying....  1 houre goes by we are trying to put the cord back in and stephane (owner)  opens the jiffy up and the coil pop out almost killing him! :shock:  i saw my fishing day end right there.... until the fish god hit me on the head and smashed IQ back into me.  HAND AXE FOR THE WIN! FTW.      went back to the good old point where all my good outting came from! 8)  and can i tell you BASS!    and more bass!    A LA selfmade 05    it was Fun to cut a hole with a hand axe . felt old school.  we hit about a dozen bass...  then it was routine.. cut a hole... then i had switch to a jig-head and a minnow.....  i felt a boom... something like a bass would do..... i set the hook like a MAD man because i had lost one at the hole recently.  but this time...... this one wasent a bass.  the line goes off........... and off..... and dosent stop......i have 10 lbs MONO ....NO leader....... good thing i set the hook right away...  this was a BRUTE of a pike..... but i didnt know this.....  no here is the part where you wont believe me but whatever.  when i comes to fishing i dont lie.  started the fight at 2:31 pm.... finished 3:02 PM...  31 minute fight..... i was shaking...... P'ed off... Happy..  1. shaking because no leader my biggest fish on ice.  2. Ped off because this burte was taking 2-3 minute pause.... like i cant bring it in and she aint moving style.  3. happy because i had set the hook very hard and if this is a p√Æke the line would have cut off already.....  FINALY i see the the KING KONG pike.  i had to go gil the freak . put my arm in the water. MISS!  bring her back... put my arm in the water.... TIGHT gils.....  FINALY get my fingers in and out she goes.....  i have parts on video ill try to edit the whole day.  But here it is the Pike i was Hunting for.....      GOT GIRTH BABY!!!    Man this was BY FAR the best fight of my life.  the longest fight of my life.  and a NICE PIECE O GIRTH!  WOW she was fat.....  FAT COW."

440375,solopaddler,2010-03-06 00:06:00,8605,I've heard some people on the board recently wonder what the attraction is for ice fishing. That they just don't get it. Well here's your answer right here! Great story and an even nicer pike!  (Can't believe you chopped holes with a hatchet!  )
440422,jaydub,2010-03-06 00:54:00,145,And once again you're report doesn't dissapoint.    Your buddy's probably hooked on hardwater fishing now! lol
440427,Syn,2010-03-06 01:05:00,519,Nice report and pictures.      Boy do those pike and smallies look chunky and healthy. Looks like they've been fed well.
440457,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-06 01:31:00,709, well syn i dont know what there diet is but man...   theres plenty of it!  and there not shy to over do it.  man that pike was a piece of CHUNK!
440515,Cudz,2010-03-06 03:23:00,2652,That pike was nice! Congrats!
440518,splashhopper,2010-03-06 03:28:00,2931,great report... and they are starting to make me think I might want to go to Quebec with my daughter for some fishing this summer
440532,bronze_back,2010-03-06 03:48:00,17,"Wow, nice pike. Always love reading your reports. Keep it up."
440552,Jigger,2010-03-06 04:13:00,1237,"Well done, and congrats on a fish that 99.9% of us would be more then happy to pull out of an axe cut hole! That pike is sweet! Love the depth of the colour on it! Again, well done! Thanks for sharing."
440578,TerryC,2010-03-06 06:44:00,196,"Great Report, and even better pics. WTG.  Clarence"
440581,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-06 07:15:00,158,"hatchet, you are a savge man and you were rewarded accordingly, nice work!"
440620,Rizzo,2010-03-06 13:42:00,4754,"great report from an insane angler. An axe??? You'd already drilled like 25 holes...use one of them! Guess I'm just getting lazy because the only way I'd be making a hole with an axe is if the auger ran dry before I got to the lake! Either way, it paid off..good for you!"
440621,Leecher,2010-03-06 13:50:00,7832,Awesome report and pics Kev I bet you got Sly hooked by now   For a first time experience..... he certainly is getting the very best exposure  Are you targetting that lake again today?? Great job on the gator    A real hawg Thanks for sharing Jacques
440663,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-06 16:43:00,709,  nah jaques maybe tommorow but today is stephanie's day!  she decides what we do!  its an anglers deal i made with her.  and i have to respect it or else!
440664,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-06 16:45:00,709,"  yeah had to grab the axe because the 2 other spots i tried were not producing anything.  so back to the old hot spot.  guess its the best spot of the lake.  maybe ill try 2 other spots tommorow but for now this spot produced lots of big fish!  they must be there for a good reason.  food, structure wise."
440669,Jigger,2010-03-06 17:15:00,1237,"Actually, the axe makes sense and probably was less work than most think. If you're just pirating your old holes, they probably wouldn't have froze as solid or as thick as the surrounding ice. Ive done the same thing with a spud bar. Easier to hit pre-existing holes. Just chip around the edges and the hole opens up pretty fast! Am I pretty close?"
440679,johnnyb,2010-03-06 17:37:00,3413,Another AWESOME report from you man....way to go on nailing that GATOR
440690,Leecher,2010-03-06 17:59:00,7832," Cool Kev     I know all about the deal     but ya should bring Steph out with you tomorrow cause just like my good old friend GCD would say  "" Stephanie's hot and you're not ""    :lol:  Good luck   tomorrow amigo"
440709,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-06 19:58:00,709,  yeah well it would take 10- 15 hits and the hole would open perfectly.  it was kind of a sneek attack.  wo knows maybe the auger would have spooked the pike and i would be pikeless!
440716,blarg,2010-03-06 21:07:00,289,"You are lucky to have such a great spot there, really nice looking fish."
440743,fishindude,2010-03-06 23:46:00,220,"Congrats and very nice catch mate, that's definitely one hell of a pike. Spring pike season should be a blast on that lake. Is this the same lake your smallmouth reports come from? Seems like a real healthy lake. What a treasure.  Cheers!"
440764,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-07 00:22:00,1362,awesome...just awesome
440766,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-07 00:29:00,3761,"Awesome report dude, GIANT Northern my man. Looking forward to catching up on the week of reports i need to catch up on!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
