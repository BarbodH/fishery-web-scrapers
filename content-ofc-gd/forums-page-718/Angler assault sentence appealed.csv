440214,splashhopper,2010-03-05 15:43:00,2931,"http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/77...ntence-appealed  A snippet of the article: ""In the early morning of Sept. 16, 2007, the professional motorcycle racer repeatedly rammed his pickup truck into a Honda Civic driven by angler Ruohang Liu, 24, in a dispute following ""nip-tipping,"" a racist term used to describe pushing Asian fishermen into the water.  Middleton ran the Civic into a tree with his truck. Shayne Berwick, 26, a passenger in the Civic, suffered severe brain damage that has left him unable to care for himself.""   I say.. throw the book at the red neck... and then throw it again at the ""justice "" system."
440229,uglyfish,2010-03-05 16:40:00,981,"i agree! sadly though, we live in canada where all of our laws... criminal, traffic and family, all all just a big freakin joke from top to bottom."
440233,Muskieman,2010-03-05 16:58:00,2472,Middleton should be rammed into a tree until he is unable to care for himself... an eye for an eye.  In racist oriented attacks like this ... the guilty party should be used as an example.  In my books there is one race and one race only... the Human one.   RFS 
440237,Fisherman,2010-03-05 17:09:00,7201,You got my vote for Judge Randy
440240,uglyfish,2010-03-05 17:16:00,981,  IM IN!! load up the trucks boys... we're goin huntin!! YEE HAW!!!
440242,Twocoda,2010-03-05 17:23:00,4130,  irony at its best
440245,blaque,2010-03-05 17:32:00,2419, LOL
440316,Big Cliff,2010-03-05 21:45:00,6899,"I firmly agree that the sentence should be appealed but I strongly disagree that it should have anything to do with the race of the victim.  As Randy so aptly put it ""there is one race, the human race""!"
440321,Terry,2010-03-05 21:54:00,14456,"assaulting anglers, yup throw the book at him  but there is little if any proof there was anything raciest in this attack, just news media blowing things out of proportion  over half the people fishing who were assaulted were white the guy with brain damage is white........why do people want to put a rascal slant on something that just isn't there but there is no excuse for assaulting any race for any reason"
440399,tb4me,2010-03-06 00:32:00,3295,"Ok here's the deal..In no way is what the guy did acceptable, NEVER. Now having said that, were on the trent river and you have no idea how many times I have come down to my dock to find garbage like , worm boxes, beer bottles, smoke packs and snagged hooks. Now this royaly pisses me off as I do have the dock area posted due to this nonsence. I have even came down there to a bunch of them sitting on my dock fishin and one of them was hocking a crap right there on the shore where my kids play.. Guys I have to tell you I was mad..wow! I totally freaked out! there was 4 of them in total and one of me..You should have seen them run.LOL..Now I have 2 no tresspassing signs and a garbage can..I also put a handrail around the one side of my dock and deck. If this summer isint any different there will be a place for sale..I love the fact that I reside in Canada but man oh man I wish we had the same tresspassing laws here as they do in USA.. You would have been reading about me by now..end Rant."
440411,tibbs,2010-03-06 00:44:00,650,"Yep, i agree that he was given way to light of a sentence for the crimes he committed."
440589,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-06 10:10:00,158,"I agree, we are simply just people. The problem is you have to prove intent, and he can say all he was doing was trying to scare them and not hurt them.  This is a race issue, he needs hard time, sick person."
440592,splashhopper,2010-03-06 10:38:00,2931,"  It's not only ""them"" that are doing that stuff.. .come fish the Maitland and Bayfields rivers and you will find the same disregard for private property there too... by ""round eyes"" too  I sure hope we never get the "" US style of trespassing laws"" up here.... It would be a damned shame to have to live in fear of some red neck with a gun ""making a point"" . ( note i said red-neck,,, not responsible gun owners)"
440639,scuro2,2010-03-06 15:16:00,904,"There is plenty of proof this was race motivated. After drinking a bunch of bonehead youths went out looking to ""tip nips"". I believe there were 5 in the party against over a dozen. It didn't matter to them that some where white. They were happy to throw those of asian decent into the water and anyone else who got in their way. It is the mark of a racist to continue, hate is hard to satisfy. They chased a Honda down and rammed it into the lake. That in the end it was a white guy who suffered doesn't matter one bit. This would have never have happened if the victims were all white. The car would have never been chased down by trucks if all the occupants of the car were white."
