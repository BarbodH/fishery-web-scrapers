440864,mistaredone,2010-03-07 03:30:00,913,I'm looking to retire my 43lb Motorguide cable steer on my 16' bass boat.  What I was wondering is if I go to a 70lb trust would I loose the finess of the lower speeds because my boat is light?  Two models ive been looking at is the 70lb motorguide cable steer thats on sale in the BPS spring flyer as I realy like the price tag or a 70lb wireless motorguide that ive found a good price on else where.  Any input would be appreciated
440866,irishfield,2010-03-07 03:34:00,26272,love my 70lb wireless on my 22 foot lund. It will pull the boat at up to 4.3mph.. or move it so slow you barely know it's moving. Great to silently troll for lakers at 1.7mph... running it from the back casting deck on the foot pedal or key fob from anywhere in the boat!
440903,landry,2010-03-07 04:55:00,1005,I have a 70 lb on my 16 foot crestliner and I can get it to creep along. Go with the 70 - as long as it has variable speed and not 5 click like speed settings - that good deal at Basspro may not be variable - it was a great price though. Check their website for customer reviews on it first. I find people to be quite honest and sometimes cheaper units have cheaper brackets/mounting. Landry
440906,landry,2010-03-07 04:59:00,1005,there is a nice used minn kota maxxum for sale in boat/motor classifieds by Les culp Jr right now. You may be able to work out a good deal on that one? Landry
