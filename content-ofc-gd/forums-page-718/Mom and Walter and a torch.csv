I had only been home a short while  at this point and was busy getting some work stuff finished and I hadnt checked my email. I did however know that something was up by how excited she seemed. I soon logged on and checked my e-mail and I just had to chuckle. I picked up the phone and called her back and she had a blast telling me how she and a friend had gone shopping and Walter was in one of the stores, my moms friend was quite impressed, after all, this was the Great Ones father! She talked about how reluctantly she was to have the picture done but her friend and Walter talked her into it, even though its a poor quality pic, I'm glad she did it. Walter said to her ""You know, I'm seventy one years old!"" To which she replied ""Oh yea? Well I'm seventy five!"" Priceless I tell you. "
