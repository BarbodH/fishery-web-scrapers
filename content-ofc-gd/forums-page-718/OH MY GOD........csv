439996,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-05 01:08:00,0,The Hamster died.... I knew I shoulda got one of the witttle wee ones at the Pet Store. Bad Santa..   My daughter is ok with it. She says Nanny has a hamster now. My Son is indifferent. My wife is crushed. Me....well I only looked at him as bait.  ..I wonder if Dead bait is good for Spring pike fishing. I guess its freezer time. Not to use as bait...so I can burry the thing out back when the ground thaws.... I think a little one is in order this time.      Springs on its way......Winternet is almost over....
