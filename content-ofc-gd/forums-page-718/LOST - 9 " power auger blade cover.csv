440769,irishfield,2010-03-07 00:35:00,26272,"Lost between Innisifil Beach and Kempenfelt Bay. Someone picked it up before I followed my tracks all the way back to the beach..... hoping it was an OFC'r. I 'd like it back as my auger rack is cut to fit it and not sure how I'll do finding an identical replacement. Reward will make it worth your while.. especially since less than 5% probably have a 9"" auger that it would fit on anyhow!  THANKS!!!!"
440772,Terry,2010-03-07 00:39:00,14456,hope you find it bud
440779,BillM,2010-03-07 00:53:00,17367,"Wayne, you sure it didn't fall out of the plane?  I am sure you saw the two planes circle and land out on the ice today.  We fished about 100ft from them for a mins on our way back....  Goodluck with finding that cover!"
440783,irishfield,2010-03-07 00:57:00,26272,Nope.. didn't see anyone land out where we were. A few buzz jobs.. but no landings. Anyone landing South of Kempenfelt is a gambler in that crap... ! !
440788,BillM,2010-03-07 01:01:00,17367," How much do one of those planes weigh?  We found at least 20inches of ice in some places today, unreal..."
440791,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-07 01:06:00,0,Was running that hwy today between 11 and 2 and I didnt see it.
440792,irishfield,2010-03-07 01:08:00,26272,Bill my airplane will stay up.. and I'd go through stepping out off the ski! It's all pounds per square foot fella. My skis have a total surface area of over 18 square feet. 1600 lbs or so/18 is only 89lb/sq foot. Me stepping out on the ice is about 200 lbs per square foot! Trucks weight 4 to 5 times what most small airplanes do! My buddy use to carry an 8 lb axe in the airplane on a rope. He'd land and then throw it out to see how thick the ice was before getting out!  I was saying they were gamblers because of the rutts and humps out there. Anyone of them could clean the landing gear right off the airplane..
440793,irishfield,2010-03-07 01:09:00,26272, Thanks Andy... lost about 8:45 to 9am... it was gone 10 minutes later!
440794,glen,2010-03-07 01:09:00,2641,"I think i saw some 9"" power auger covers on sale. What model do you have?  I can check sunday."
440807,BillM,2010-03-07 01:31:00,17367,"  Ahhh , ok I thought you might have been referring to those ruts of death out there this morning rather then the ice thickness  The drive out was brutal, I thought for sure I was going to slice a sidewall open..."
440808,irishfield,2010-03-07 01:33:00,26272,"9"" Jiffy Lightning. It's a full round cover with a flange on it around the outside edge. The flange holds my auger tight in place! Thanks Glen!"
440861,misfish,2010-03-07 03:26:00,29133,"Seen two nice planes parked out on the ice, in front of Hooters today. As for yer cover,cut a bottom off a 5 liter pail.Works fine."
