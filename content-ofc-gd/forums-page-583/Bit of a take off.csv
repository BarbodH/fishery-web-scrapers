544539,HTHM,2011-01-28 03:06:00,4082,"An addition to the stories, Drifter_016 does not know me from Adam, and he sent me a substantial amount of cash to purchase a motor for him. The seller was astounded that a internet board could be so trusting. So now I have a really nice motor, and I did not have to pay for it. (Don't worry drifter, Mike knows where i live...for now."
544540,Daplumma,2011-01-28 03:10:00,1961,I finally admitted to an affair I wasn't having because it was way too implausable of a story that I was gonna drive 14 hrs one way to hang out for a few days with a bunch of guys I met on line.I'm just sayin'. Joe
544764,aplumma,2011-01-28 19:40:00,6896, Ummm wait this is just wrong because that makes me an accomplice to an affair instead of a trip with my Brother to go fishin. I feel so dirty now.   Art
544857,mercman,2011-01-28 23:19:00,7054,"  actually it wasnt pepper spray,it was my Stetson.Still burns like a ess o bee thought  You are very welcome for dinner Albert."
543933,misfish,2011-01-26 21:15:00,29133,"Didnt want to step on his toes, so heres a question for ya.   When you did decide to fish with a member from here or anywhere off the WWW.How many had thier wives ask them,,,,,,,,,,,,,  How long have you known this person?How do you know thier not some cyco or murder?  I fished with 3 guys at the start that said that to me.Guess it could happen,but if you have good reports and been around,you know whos who."
543939,Sinker,2011-01-26 21:25:00,8692,"I've been asked that question by a few people now. I think I'm a pretty good judge of character, even thru internet posts, to know if someone is nuts or not. Even if they are nuts, we usually hit it off anyways......I'm surprised any of them would fish with me to be honest  S."
543942,skeeter,2011-01-26 21:31:00,1907, and i thought i was the only one with a wife like that!
543943,Terry,2011-01-26 21:32:00,14456,"the very first time I was meeting up w2ith internet people to go fishing I happened to visit my mother the day before she said to me Have you never seen the news reports about meeting people from the internet, you can't trust them  my god you can't go   I said something like...I am going fishing so I think I am safe  besides from what I have seen on the news it's old men pretending to be young boys or girls who try to meet kids  so who would pretend to be an older guy that wants to fish with me ..maybe a younger women.....god I hope that's the case..  any ways she called me after I went to make sure I made it home from my encounter .....I told her I was unmolested and caught fish..  oh and it was a guy about the age and shape he said he was...."
543951,fishing n autograph,2011-01-26 21:54:00,2540,I think Pikehunter's wife said the same thing when i went fishing with him lol
543955,mercman,2011-01-26 21:59:00,7054,i got the same thing the other day before i met HTHM. So we met in a big public place  and she brought her pepper spray just in case.
543956,misfish,2011-01-26 21:59:00,29133,"  Im still not sure about you,,,,,,,"
543988,BillM,2011-01-26 23:12:00,17367,"So where did you fish today?  'Oh, I met some dude off the internet'   "
543995,kickingfrog,2011-01-26 23:50:00,8333,"A couple of times I've left a note at home, just in case. So far I've always made it back before she got home."
544004,Gregoire,2011-01-27 00:06:00,1397,"My girlfriend had a similar response, actually nearly freaked out, she just doesn't get the fishing."
544010,Rob,2011-01-27 00:25:00,467,"Everytime I go fishing with you Brian I ask that question to myself!  Got skunked again today, although I am getting closer as I rolled one...whitefish that is!   Rob C"
544013,misfish,2011-01-27 00:34:00,29133,"  Shouldnt you be teaching, instead of being schooled?"
544052,Pikeslayer,2011-01-27 01:47:00,1443,The less mrs. Pikeslayer knows...............
544149,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-27 05:28:00,2582,Debbe calls all my fishing buddies I have met through fishing sites...my internet dates.  She has met about 75% of them personally...the other 25%....what she doesn't know won't hurt her
544186,Sinker,2011-01-27 13:31:00,8692," Just for the record, I have met Debbe  S."
544201,Beans,2011-01-27 14:10:00,3339,   I have met her also...Great gal !  
544211,GBW,2011-01-27 14:38:00,8460,"nope, you are not alone...  mine always says ""so who is this guy and how do you know him?"" I tell her, then I hear ""your going out with a stranger again?!?!?"""
544341,GBW,2011-01-27 19:16:00,8460,"HAHAHAHA, and nope."
544353,johnnyb,2011-01-27 19:51:00,3413,"The first time I fished with guys I met on the 'net, I took my girlfriend with me.  Showed up on time....they were all ready to go, snowmobiles and atv's running.  I had only told them I was bringing a ""friend"".....didn't mention my friend was a 5'2"" blonde with big blue eyes   Once they saw us, the guy with the atv...think his name was Terry... ....he just grabbed her and threw her on the back of his quad and away they went through the slush!  I held on to the back of a snowmobile  and didn't see her until half an hour later in the middle of lake Temagami.  I did have time to wonder to myself what I'd gotten us into.....but all went well and yeah, I'd do it again"
544355,Terry,2011-01-27 19:55:00,14456,I remember that day  you and your buddy......LOL
544423,Radnine,2011-01-27 23:43:00,1538," OMG! That hilarious! When I fished with Hometown that time, my wife is like ""So how do you know this guy? I mean how do you know he won't get you out in the water and throw you overboard?"" Good one. Jim"
544431,buckster,2011-01-27 23:56:00,530,She would have to be a great gal to put up with Steve
544436,Jigger,2011-01-28 00:04:00,1237,So true. My wife asks still and I've gone fishing with quite a few guys off the intrawebs. It actually is a tad more weird when you're trying to explain it to non-fisher friends...
544483,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-28 01:14:00,2582,Yes and she speaks highly of you...   and of you as well Beansie She however hopes Tony gets spooled by a monster whitie his next visit to Simcoe
544538,HTHM,2011-01-28 03:01:00,4082,I don't know if I should be insulted or not.... Thanks for dinner again!
