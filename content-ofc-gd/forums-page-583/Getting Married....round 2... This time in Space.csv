544913,Roy,2011-01-29 01:19:00,13728,Sorry Jedimaster but I think a few members have turned this into something that shouldn't be here.
544786,jedimaster,2011-01-28 20:47:00,3472,"Ok so I am getting re married. This time we are going to try and get married in space. Yep you heard me. We are trying to raise enough money to have the cerimony in Space on the Virgin Galactic.  Check out the website www.marriedinspace.com  Anyway... check it out and pass this note on to anyone you tihnkg may care...News, Media, Twitter, Facebook whatever...  "
544789,brandon,2011-01-28 21:00:00,857,I just tweeted it...good luck!
544790,discophish,2011-01-28 21:02:00,392,"Cool concept.  Good luck to you and congratulations to your engagement!  Awesome that you will donate some of the funds to charity.  That's a really good idea.  Wouldn't it be neat to conceive a child in space, and to give birth to a green baby with antennas 11 months later?  How cool would that be?!!!"
544791,GBW,2011-01-28 21:02:00,8460,you going with to take the pic's?

544805,GBW,2011-01-28 21:45:00,8460,"I think you should see if you can go, how COOL would that be?!??!?!?!"
544807,misfish,2011-01-28 21:49:00,29133,  You mean renew or to someone else.LOL
544814,jedimaster,2011-01-28 22:21:00,3472,To someone else. I am actually kind of hoping we get enough to throw some money to a charity and pay for some of the wedding. But man it would be sweet if we got enough money to go to space. That woudl so rock.... I already looked it up there is a space suit designed for sex in space... haha seriously there is.
544847,mercman,2011-01-28 23:08:00,7054,"ya but weightlessness would make it hard to aim, wouldnt it"

544849,jedimaster,2011-01-28 23:10:00,3472,Thats what the space suit is for. its like two suits stuck together with bunjee cords.
544850,GBW,2011-01-28 23:11:00,8460,"think of it as the ""canada Arm"" on the craft, it doesn't miss..."
544853,mercman,2011-01-28 23:14:00,7054,  ahhh.Very interesting. I'm sure Einstein had a theory for it.The angle of the dangle theory i think.
544856,GBW,2011-01-28 23:18:00,8460,the Quaker and the Maker I am told...
544858,Twocoda,2011-01-28 23:22:00,4130,"  Merc i mis-read your comment and thought it said ""witnessless"" then i thought....there a big savings when it come time for divorce  my bad  Congrtes JM on the engagement !!!....but if your getting married in space...where in the universe are ya going to go for a honeymoon?"
544860,jedimaster,2011-01-28 23:34:00,3472,  Hopefully not 6 feet under... more than likely back to work with a sore neck.
544861,jedimaster,2011-01-28 23:35:00,3472,The 2 suit for having sex in space...  http://shock.military.com/Shock/videos.do?displayContent=216649

544872,spincast,2011-01-28 23:59:00,3279,"cool place to get married - congrats be sure to post some (family oriented) pics... Of course having the somewhat twisted mind I do, I was considering just how effective a place it could be to get divorced .. ""heyhon, the bedrooms just through that door... I'll be back in a sec, just have to use the head""..followed by a wooooshing sound..."
544878,mercman,2011-01-29 00:03:00,7054,"forget about it !!! Looks so complicated, and with my low patience level, i'd probably rip a hole in it and get sucked into the vacumm of space.................Houston, we have a problem Humm.....hold on just a minute"
544881,jedimaster,2011-01-29 00:13:00,3472,I think I would have some performance anxiety up in space... better bring some blue pills....
544896,mercman,2011-01-29 00:43:00,7054," humm, i guess this is ok, but my ketchup spray radius comment wasn't....Oh well, i'll conform, and keep it cleaner"
