As ""luck"" would have it, the accident wiped out one of our fibre optic huts so myself along with 3 others co-workers got the call to head up there and splice together a by-pass cable to get several high priority customers back up and running. I have to say, I've never seen such carnage. It was bizarre seeing rail cars twisted and torn open like sardine cans. Anyways, here are a few pics from the day.  Our crew rolling up on site.    Our hut took a beating.    Carnage.    More Carnage.    Randy and I setting up our work area.    Me splicing.    A grain car....took them all day to vaccuum the grain out.    One of the many massive machines laying tracks.  "

I was the driver for our 90 ton Pettibone over the road crane and derrick engineer for our 250 ton over the rail steam crane. But I also sometimes worked as the cook when the steam crane went out. As cook I did more work but I always enjoyed cooking, plus I stayed WARM in the winter."
