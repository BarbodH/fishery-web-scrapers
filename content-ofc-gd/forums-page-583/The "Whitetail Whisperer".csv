544708,GBW,2011-01-28 17:08:00,8460,I found this cool pic of Gordon Pyzer.  Talk about the good life eh?  
544711,lew,2011-01-28 17:17:00,12766,"Great picture Geoff !!  I have a bunch of deer in the backyard every morning & evening but so far haven't got them feeding outta my hand yet, although a couple days ago 3 of them walked within 5 feet of the back steps.  Beautiful critters !!"
544721,Beans,2011-01-28 17:32:00,3339,Ya Lew...they sure are purdy...    Photo by DanC  I don't think I could ever shoot one except with a camera...
544770,misfish,2011-01-28 19:59:00,29133," But I,ll bet you wouldnt turn down a venison pepperette Norm.LOL  My pop has them coming to the side door of the garage when he,s late getting thier feed out."
544771,fishing n autograph,2011-01-28 20:01:00,2540,"i go out looking for them in my area, but i can't really find them...i see them all of the time when i'm working but i don't have my camera with me"
544835,danc,2011-01-28 22:46:00,4677,Sis and a wild Deer.  
544836,dave524,2011-01-28 22:47:00,4508,Something a little strange about that pic?? What's with the chain hanging off the far side of it's mouth? and the antlers seem to be missing a bit here and there? However there is a deer track in the snow which seems to validate it a genuine!
544838,aplumma,2011-01-28 22:51:00,6896,  Looks like a broken tine and the chain is behind him...  Art
544839,aplumma,2011-01-28 22:51:00,6896,  Dan it looks like the deer just told your Sis the worlds funniest joke...that priceless.   Art
544840,Spiel,2011-01-28 22:58:00,9065, Well I believe to the left of Gord right above the railing is a trailer (black) and the chains would be on the trailer toungue.
544845,GBW,2011-01-28 23:04:00,8460,"Gord does say that the deer would be a 10 point but it must have been in a fight to have some break off  I too see a trailer to the left.  Guys, I didn't photoshop this, it was something he (Gordon) posted on hs facebook page.  His wife took the pic and he said the deer is much larger then how it looks in the pic due to the fact he is in front of it.  I never thought I would see a post doubting it was real or not, just sharing..."
544846,GBW,2011-01-28 23:08:00,8460," Great pic!  I wonder if the deer likes the hoops, like bass like spinner baits?  Brian, new trick to try for you?  Hang some hoop earings off trees to bring them in?"
544914,ch312,2011-01-29 01:21:00,1590,"that's right folks, keep making those deer think humans aren't a threat. i'm sure it will help someone fill their freezer one day"
544921,danc,2011-01-29 01:38:00,4677," While Deer are nice to see on occasion, they are a menace up here. Our fleet of 15 vehicles where I work have killed three Deer in 2010. One way or another, a cull is in order. Filling ones freezer is much better than crow food and a $5000.00 insurance claim."
544922,dave524,2011-01-29 01:46:00,4508, Sorry didn't catch the trailer
544923,Abberz,2011-01-29 01:46:00,140,I love Gord and that other pic is great....but these just don't look natural. Wild deer shouldn't be that tame IMO.  Really cool pics tho!
545044,Spiel,2011-01-29 13:17:00,9065, It took me a while to figure it out Dave as it sure appears as though they're hanging from the buck.
