544092,kickingfrog,2011-01-27 03:27:00,8333,Would solve a lot of headaches at the ramp... and you don't need to find a parking spot for your tow vehicle.

544117,irishfield,2011-01-27 04:15:00,26272,Leah just asked me to modify her steel boat.. so she can drive up the boat ramp and then to the grocery store..  Sounds like a challenge to me... slap a slow moving vehicle sign on it and have at 'er.. lol
544336,mercman,2011-01-27 19:05:00,7054,i bet Troy on Swamp People could use a boat like that.
