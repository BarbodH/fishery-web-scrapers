545254,inkslinger11,2011-01-29 22:38:00,9,Just curious as to what folks are using and having luck on. I always take a bunch of jigs and lures out and always resort back to minnows. Comin up from Toronto to Nippissing on the 3rd of feb. and am not sure if I should stop to get larger minnows here or just use what is given with our bungalow package there.
