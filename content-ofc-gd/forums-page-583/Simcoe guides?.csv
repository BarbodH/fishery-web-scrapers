Not sure about the travel situation...very slushy right now on the lake, tough on ATVs...I was out Wed -- good fishing, but slow going and very wet, especially around cracks..."
544473,steverowbotham,2011-01-28 00:58:00,1800,"Hey thanks for the recommendations guys, I'll definitely do my best to put you on fish.  Ryan's screen name is troutguy, and as with everything, I recommend shopping around.  Ryan is also an excellent choice, you can see his site @ www.wepoundemfishing.com or the link to my site is below.  Hope you're on fish whichever route you choose!"
