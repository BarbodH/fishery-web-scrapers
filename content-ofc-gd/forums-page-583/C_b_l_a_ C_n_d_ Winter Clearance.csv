I ordered the Baffin Evolution Boot for $122.49 (saved $50) but did had to pay $13 for shipping. There's also an 'Eskimo 8"" power auger for $329 (reg $409) and ice shelters are on sale.  Just wanted to give a 'heads up' if any one is interested. BTW, be sure to use the .ca website.  Regards, pikeslayer"
