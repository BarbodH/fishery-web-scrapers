It is St. Croix's fault as I would be ice fishing if not for THE ROD FALLING APART!! Jim"
544527,bigugli,2011-01-28 02:42:00,6138,Quick!!  Run to the garage and start fondling your fishing tackle. The intervention crisis team is on its way! Whatever you do. Do not look at the television set!!!
544529,HTHM,2011-01-28 02:44:00,4082,"Just end it now, Jim. There is no hope in this world for you anymore"
544531,mercman,2011-01-28 02:47:00,7054,Qucik Robin !!!!!!!!!!!!!! to the batmobile.............Hang on Rad !!!!!!!!we`re on out way
544643,Pikeslayer,2011-01-28 14:32:00,1443," Jim, It's over. You will never be the same. Please pm me with your fishing inventory. I will purchase the whole lot at once to ease your pain. Would you consider trading straight up for an all inclusive 'Day at the Spa'???"
544647,mercman,2011-01-28 14:43:00,7054,"  If ya got any doubles Simon, think of me, not Skeets eh ? Hey Jim......i think that Spa Day includes waxing and facial peel too"
544653,JohnF,2011-01-28 15:01:00,3494,Now you're finding out why I've been reduced to watching the Food Network whilst convalescing. I've learned to sprinkle salt from high above the dish and to add a little butter to the olive oil to put a nice shine on the sauce. The alternative is reruns of NCIS. The only live tv I watch is the Maple Leafs and some nights the live part is up for debate.  But at least I haven't found myself watching Tyler yet.
544662,Spiel,2011-01-28 15:41:00,9065, Too funny.
544669,Harrison,2011-01-28 15:53:00,2202,IF you don't have it already.... Get HBO.

544680,Headhunter,2011-01-28 16:09:00,5703,I'm a BIG fan of the city by city auditions portion of the show... it's like a steady flow of train wrecks... HH
544899,Radnine,2011-01-29 00:50:00,1538, Thanks for taking the heat off of me John. Jim
544905,JohnF,2011-01-29 01:09:00,3494, I have broad shoulders.  JF

544931,HTHM,2011-01-29 02:06:00,4082,Not just your shoulders.....
545041,JohnF,2011-01-29 13:00:00,3494, Us super sized guys shouldn't wear Holstein ot Hereford colored jackets.  JF
545042,JohnF,2011-01-29 13:05:00,3494," Actually you'd hardly recognize me now. Size 36 pants, size large shirts etc. I'm a mere shadow of my old self. Convalescence is a lousy way to diet. I now have a closet full of size 40 pants and XL/XXL jackets & shirts. My wife has always said I buy too many clothes. Now I know what she means.  JF"
545056,HTHM,2011-01-29 14:13:00,4082,You might be able to get back to diving shape....
545057,JohnF,2011-01-29 14:31:00,3494, I dived at my heaviest. Just needed more lead to get my fat ass down. I doubt I'll do much diving again though. I was getting too silly for an old fart. Silly diving is for youngsters. Fishing is much safer and cheaper.  JF
