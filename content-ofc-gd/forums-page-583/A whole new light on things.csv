545039,Big Cliff,2011-01-29 12:51:00,6899," It sure is amazing!  Well, it just keeps getting better each day. I still need glasses to work on the computer or for reading but this is only day 4. As for distance, heck, I can see things on the other side of the lake that I didn't even know existed before even with my glasses on.  Beans, mine advanced very quickly. I had just gotten new glasses last year and within 6 months the cataracts developed to the point where something had to be done.  I do have to wear sun glasses most of the time when I am outside, the glare off of the snow is almost blinding even on a dull day but I expect that even that will improve as time goes on and the eyes heal.  I see the surgeon next Thursday and can start driving again after that."
545048,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-29 13:41:00,2582, That's good...cause we gots smelts to catch
544225,Big Cliff,2011-01-27 15:42:00,6899,"Well, had the cataract surgery yesterday, quite an experience! They did both eyes so I was running kind of blind afterwards but by this morning I started to notice a really big change. White actually is REALLY white, lights in the house that seemed dim before are almost too bright now. Boy what a differance!  Things are still kind of blured but I just had my follow up visit and the surgeon said he was very pleased with the way things went and over the next few days my vision should continue to improve to the point I'll only need reading glasses.  Can't drive for a week but that's ok, Sue will take me anywhere I need to go.  Anyway, just wanted to let you know that FISHING STARTS as of next weekend and look out fish!!!!!"
544228,stubbex1,2011-01-27 15:50:00,164,"Hi CLiff,  is it the laser surgery you had?"
544229,Pikeslayer,2011-01-27 15:52:00,1443,"Awsome news Cliff . Be sure to stick to the recovery procedure (BTW what are you doing on the computer).  Best Regards, Simon"
544231,Billy Bob,2011-01-27 15:58:00,5865,GREAT news.....we take our eye sight for granted most times....  Bob
544232,Big Cliff,2011-01-27 15:59:00,6899," No, cataracts removed, new lenses put in."
544234,Joey,2011-01-27 15:59:00,9122,That's great Cliff.  All the people I've talked to since having surgery like that say the White is the biggest difference.  Glad you can see better now  Joey
544236,Big Cliff,2011-01-27 16:01:00,6899, It's a bit hard but I just had to let everyone know that I'm good to go and warn the fish LOL.
544238,mercman,2011-01-27 16:02:00,7054, i had it done on my right eye 2 years ago.Actually replaced the lens. I was exicted because after many years i could actually see the stars again !  and colors !!!! wow. I am sposed to go this year for the left side.
544243,splashhopper,2011-01-27 16:06:00,2931,cliff.... u will have to get a new mirror for your toilet now..  The new one should say : objects in mirror are further away than they appear in the mirror
544257,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-27 16:32:00,2582,Glad everything went off OK Cliff. Now relax and take it easy...I know that will be hard for you... so the recovery process does what it has to do.
544268,ketchenany,2011-01-27 16:51:00,3229,  NOW YOU CAN SEE THEM! Good news Cliff.
544286,Spiel,2011-01-27 17:25:00,9065,That's great Cliff.
544344,skeeter,2011-01-27 19:20:00,1907,terrific news Cliff!!!!! what did sue say when you told her that she looks better today then when you married her?
544365,bigugli,2011-01-27 20:20:00,6138,That is good news Cliff.
544373,Twocoda,2011-01-27 20:48:00,4130, SMOOOOOOOOTH!!!!! that outta be good for a lobster dinner!!!
544387,lew,2011-01-27 21:17:00,12766,"Wonderful news Cliff, it must be a great feeling to return to clear vision again."
544391,smally21,2011-01-27 21:33:00,993,"great news cliff! i had poor vision for years, finally got laser surgery as a job requirement. couldn't beleive the sensation of having good vision again. enjoy the experience - by the way the fish, unfortunately, got smaller when my sight got better.  fortunately i had eye surgery, not truth surgery."
544547,camillj,2011-01-28 03:26:00,1988,How many fingers am I holding up ?
544610,Jer,2011-01-28 12:04:00,1426,"Good to hear, Cliff. Glad your surgery went well."
544613,fishing n autograph,2011-01-28 12:13:00,2540,"Awesome Cliff, now you'll realize that blurry foggy cover over Toronto is really smog and not your eyes LOL"
544710,Beans,2011-01-28 17:12:00,3339,"Glad to hear things went well Cliff...  Makes me wish I could get mine done soon but I understand mine aren't bad enough yet...  My opthamologist told me fifteen years ago that I had the beginnings of cataracts and that he would have to operate to remove them before he retires (he was a young man then with a two year old son)  ""Cripes"" I replied ""I'm 60 years old... I may have croaked before then !!!""  Still not bad enough at my annual checkup last October...  Now to get my gout under control before you are ready to fish...it can get awful cold on the feets when you can't get your boots on  Pick-up new meds today..."
544715,lew,2011-01-28 17:24:00,12766," Hey Norm, I have a bit of gout that flares up every couple years and when it does, I pop a couple Indomethacin and it clears it right up.  Just a thought."
544971,Beans,2011-01-29 03:30:00,3339, Thanks Lew...  Still don't know what I'll be taking...  Seems the stuff that the doc ordered this morning does not mix well with one of my other meds and the pharmacist has to discuss this with my doc who does not work in Buckhorn on Fridays so I'm guessing it will be Monday before I get started on sumpin'...     
544991,Jonny,2011-01-29 04:22:00,1380,"Don't tell your fishing buddies, Cliff.  They'll drill you an extra hole, flop you down on the ice and put a coat over your head.  You'll be demoted to ""Scout""."
545036,pikehunter,2011-01-29 12:26:00,1659,"Happy to hear the news!  Had mine done a few years ago, went from super thick high index lenses to 20/20 in one eye and 20/30 in the other. Now I use dollar store glasses to read with and it's the first time in my life I can wear real honest to god sunglasses.  Only issue was with lights at night and white on black etc. The Doc. did laser surgery afterwards, twice on my left and once on the right to help the problem. It got better but still a little awkward. At the beginning I would see 2 sets of headlights coming at me on the road, that sort of thing. Now lights or bright light are just an issue but not too serious.  It is an amazing experience."
