Got tired of the perch in 85' so started targeting the main basin of the lake with good results. I have marked more baitfish clouds than I can ever remember marking on the lake during the winter season Herring schools coming through on a regular basis and TONS of smelt. Just gotta get your bait either above or below the school of bait and wait for those marks on the graph to show up. Most fish today were spoon feed and even got a couple on the tube. Decided to keep a few for the table tonight emmmmmmmm! Fish seemed to be in 100+ft compared to their usual 60-70' range where we normally target them. Tightlines, R"

544506,12footspringbok,2011-01-28 01:58:00,459,Nice!   Can't wait to tour the lake this weekend.

544546,Bernie66,2011-01-28 03:23:00,123,"Simcoe was very kind today.  Cloudy, -4celcius, very light wind and the whities were cooperative.  I was out with a buddy near BBP today in around 85fow.  Marked and hooked many fish but not one on the willams.  All hits came off the jig off bottom.  Most instance, as soon as we marked bait fish, the hits would come within seconds.  Most people around us were catching fish too so I guess it was a good day all around for everyone."
