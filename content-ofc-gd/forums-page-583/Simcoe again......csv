Fishing has been steady, although today you really had to work for them.  Best bait for me has been spoons, with a few fish coming on tubes. Buddy's had minnows hanging all day( splitshot and single hook/4lb flouro leads) and not a sniff   If your walking wear rubber boots cause its sloppy out there, lots of water around the holes. If your dragging a hut... bring lots of water (hopefully the cold will tighten everything up) Good luck this weekend, it should be good  R"
