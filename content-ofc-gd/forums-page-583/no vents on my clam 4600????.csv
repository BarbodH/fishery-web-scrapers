544392,landry,2011-01-27 21:35:00,1005,I just bought a used hut (clam 4600) and it was a great deal and in great shape - BUT - there are no vents on it??? I am assuming that I need vents to run a heater? Should I cut vents and hand stitch mesh on it or what??? Help!  Landry

544503,Terry,2011-01-28 01:57:00,14456,"just for the record  if there is no oxygen, every flame will shut off"
544534,SBCregal,2011-01-28 02:55:00,688,if theres no oxygen...its kinda late
544567,nofish4me,2011-01-28 03:59:00,404,"Oxygen or no Oxygen isn't the problem, it's the CO (not Conservation Officer) that's deadly. Would you fire up the BBQ to heat the house if the power went out? I'll assume you wouldn't, but you might turn on a gas fired stove or oven? Same thing! Just crack open the flap on the shelter and beware of the signs of CO poisining. Spring fishing trips are around the corner, just remember the old Serval fridges (actually mandated out of service) are gas fired, open some windows."
