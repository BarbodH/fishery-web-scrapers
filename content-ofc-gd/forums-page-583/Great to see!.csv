But fishing at bayfront with my son rite now, and just as we landed a nice little pike, got a visit to the hut by a conservation officer!! First time I have personally seen one in the field but it was fantastic to chat with him and see they are making their way to the bay more often. Checked my license, chatted a bit more then was on his way."
