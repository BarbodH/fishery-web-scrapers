Got down to the POOL yesterday with a new buddy who has never been.   - Temperatures were good (Compared to what we have been getting) - There was a fair bit of ice & slush - 1 out 3 successful casts - BRING a NET!   We ended up with (2) Browns. Lost (2) through the ice & slush Guy beside us caught nice Rainbow  It was a nice outing.   Minnow- Float Drifting  *no success (Roe, Pinks - chucking spoons & spinners)"
