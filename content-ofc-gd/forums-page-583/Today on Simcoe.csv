543148,Headhunter,2011-01-24 20:07:00,5703,"Well, you're a better man than I am! FishnSled and I hit Sibbald PP yesterday in search of the mighty Perch... our feeling being that we can get sheer numbers out of Cook's, but we were hoping for more size yesterday. Well, dragging the portable hut across that god foresaken ice/snow/ poo was exhausting, even for the two of us. We barely managed to get to 15 fow before both of us looked at each other and said, that'll do! The fishing sucked, so we have decided that we would much rather catch 150+ perch and only bring back ten, then catch 10 and only bring back 5! We would have made the trek out to Whitie land, but it just wasn't happening. Kudo's to you for your efforts, but I would not ever count on anyone to get me out of a situation. That's what was going through my head when we were out there yesterday... yah, we could probably get out to deep water, but I don't know how the heck I'm gonna get everything back in! LOL HH"
543442,bassnass,2011-01-25 15:36:00,174,Way to work!
543573,John Kimble,2011-01-25 23:57:00,12,"  Nice Report Emil! Caught up with you Chevy once last season - if you ever need a ride just flag me down anytime! Look for a blue skidoo and suit with orange hoodie, and a limit of whities, lakers AND ling cod. Lol.  It's been a tough start for the Whities and Lakers so far this year. Though, I think I've finally figured them out this past weekend. Took a lot of running and gunning but it payed off big time.  See you on the ice and Cheers!  J.Kimble  "
543577,icefisherman,2011-01-26 00:15:00,952,"Hey John, how are you doing Bud? Sure remember you....how could I not....and all that Ling ha ha ha...got to get together some time for sure... Now if you in the meantime decide to sale that machine of yours....feel free to PM me Whities have been playing hard ball so far this season but with bit of extra work, not impossible to get into them... So yes, got to get together and compare notes  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
543608,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-26 01:30:00,655,"Good job on the whities! I feel your pain, I did the same type of thing hauling out heavy gear in the deep snow and a marathon walk with TonyB and a couple buds.  We couldn't continue to better grounds and only had 2 bites and a skunk to show for our aching bones    You persevered and got a couple good fish! Nice job. TonyB and I have said for the past few years.. ""next year I will have a sled!"". And every year we forget how bad the walk is and don't buy one    One of these years we will have machines!"
543612,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-26 01:40:00,655,"Wow John, those are impressive ling! Did you get those on Simcoe? If so, would you mind sharing your technique for catching them? I've never caught a ling before, and I would like to try for them.. although I don't plan on keeping any lol. Feel free to PM me if you like. I'm not looking for any of your secrets, just want an idea where to start. Thanks. I've heard dead bait on bottom at night works? They are a cool looking fish. I gues you eat them?"
543645,bassnass,2011-01-26 02:38:00,174,"Alright, so it's me, aaron, and ice with you, John.  When we goin'?!"
543662,icefisherman,2011-01-26 03:02:00,952,"Hahaha Love that challenge Lincoln....waiting on John to confirm ;-) Been trying to hook up with Aaron for while so here is the opportunity...and yes I too keep promissing myself to buy me a machine and then forget but it just might happen this year How about this Thursday or Friday?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
543698,limeyangler,2011-01-26 05:56:00,5204,"Jaysus man...15km! That is madness.....i salute you  I too would love to have seen the cops face as he pulled over the 'sweaty,orange juice pervert guy that smelled of cucumber(whitefish smell like cucumber imo)  Got your limit....well worth the effort, jeeze...what a lunatic you are Emil...thats some trek you went on."
543731,bassnass,2011-01-26 13:24:00,174,Perfect
544015,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-27 00:37:00,655," I work on the weekdays, but I'll be heading out on the weekend. Either Sat or Sun, haven't decided yet. I have a good spot that should produce well for numbers (packing very light this time so I can get to it   ), then I plan to hit an exploratory spot on the way back in for giant perch. Send me a PM Emil if you want to hook up, would love to fish with you. It's been a few years since I saw you on the ice. It was when I was fishing with Don McCaw and we all fished together for a while... you were putting on a clinic with your Williams  At least I'm not the only crazy nut out there walking a marathon to fish whities"
544055,icefisherman,2011-01-27 01:56:00,952,"I remember that trip Aaron...it was lots of fun. If not mistaken Don from Ice Guidez was there too...haven't seen him recently though he is almost a neighbor...taking my son to soccer on Saturdays...so that is out....trying to see if I can get out tomorrow or Friday but that depends if I manage to find find someone with a machine to go together....no much luck so far....and John hasn't replied yet...don't know if I can do second 15 km trip in 4 days  As far as crazy ha ha ha I've seen a lot of your extreme reports so you are solid competition in the crazy department  So I'll have to wait and see what happens between now and Saturday night before confirming for Sunday walk...one way or another we'll do some whitie hunting with you....just matter of when exactly ;-)  To be continued....  Cheers, Ice FIsherman"
544394,cityfisher,2011-01-27 21:38:00,959,"hey guys, I might be heading out with the sled Sunday( wont know for sure till Friday night)... After i heard about all the slush out there. I think ill just keep the party to two ... Rough on the old sled going back and forth. Tight lines!"
544478,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-28 01:00:00,655,"Ya Emil, that is who I was fishing with, Don McCaw from Ice Guidez.  Looks like I will be going Sunday. Thanks for the offer Cityfisher, but looks like I will have a few people with me walking out.  Good luck this week and weekend everyone!"
544488,icefisherman,2011-01-28 01:20:00,952," Well Aaron,  I may see you on Sunday then...not sure yet but it looks as the only day this week it could work out for me. Will keep my eyes open for your group. Who knows we may still bump into each other...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
544570,cityfisher,2011-01-28 04:06:00,959,"Right on guys , Sunday should be good."
545013,John Kimble,2011-01-29 05:30:00,12,"Hey guys,  Sorry for the delayed response - been super busy with report cards this week. Let's hook up for a trip sometime this winter for sure! I can be reached at [emailÂ protected]. I'll be out on Simcoe running and gunning a number of spots tomorrow morning.  As for the Ling Cod on Simcoe, they are definitely there but it does takes a lot of luck to consistently get into them. We were in 75+FOW near a shoal. They spawn mid winter underneath the ice so focusing on fishing structure is the key. The williams or sweedish pimple spoon tipped with a minnow got a bunch of them as they keyed into the fishy smell.  Be safe and Good Luck!  ~Ryan (John Kimble)   P.S - GREAT episodes and videos Aaron!"
542941,icefisherman,2011-01-24 01:27:00,952,"Well...I was determined to get my limit today no matter what...since I couldn't find anyone to come with me in the last moment last night I went ...alone...Now if I knew what was expecting me on the ice I would never have done it...don't wish the punishment i took today to my biggest enemy. It was that super difficult conditions... Started at 6:45....with 2 stops on the way got my my final destination by 10:30....how do you spell COLD and MISERABLE?   It was that and then some more....time to buy myself a snowmachine...too old for this walking game....15 km total in foot deep snow and slush and water and cracks and you name it,....back at the car at 5:15 pm......barely....had to sit and relax every 100m and then sat on the bucket by the car for 20 min just to pick up my breath and be able to open it and load my stuff....total exhaustion...have never had it so hard...every part of my body was hating me today and will be for the rest of the week...forgot my water bottle in the car...so sweating all wet and dehydrated...was about to drink from the hole...got to Sobeys and bought 10 x 1L orange juice and drunk 4 of them on the way home...had to drive only in my boxers since everything was soaking wet....heater on 32 degrees....good thing didn't get stopped by a cop as I would have had some explaining to do  Anyhow...this is my last time doing this exercise....I promise it to myself...  Now on to fishing....mission accomplished as I got my limit of whities in the couple hours I had to actually fish while getting ready for the return trip... Meegs and Williams both produced...other people were getting fish too...85 fow...fish was coming and going all day...not super hot bite but enough to keep you entertained and to get your limit. It was so cold fish froze so much that after an hour at home in the sink it was still so cold the kids didn't want to hold it for the picture....had to really negotiate with them...good thing I got couple chocolates from Sobbey just in case    Any how.... I am out...laying down and breading deep....need some well deserved rest and a case of beer tomorrow night with whities on the menu   P.S. I begged 3 people on the way back to help me and give me a ride back to shore if going in the same direction telling them I'll pay them,....but no luck...was given all kinds of excuses....was left with very bad taste in my mouth for sure...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
542943,BillM,2011-01-24 01:34:00,17367,"Good job man!  I've found most people out on Simcoe really laid back and willing to help, that really sucks they didn't help you out on the walk back..  The weather this weekend was brutal, I looked at the temp and there was no way I was pulling the hut through all that snow and -26 degree temps.  Good on ya."
542944,Terry,2011-01-24 01:35:00,14456,"nice to see you got your fish  too bad about the guys not wanting to give you a ride in, on a day like today...   we got our limit yesterday on simcoe so it's nice to see things are picking up"
542949,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-24 01:36:00,2582,Well Emil I hope you enjoy the beer and the fish fry tomorrow night...it sure sounds like you earned it.  I had a similiar day a few winter's ago on Couch. Deep snow with about 6 inches of slush/water underneath. On the walk back in I was running on fumes. I was literally counting out  steps and stopping for a rest every 100 steps. NEVER again.
542954,kickingfrog,2011-01-24 01:44:00,8333,Makes me feel like my walk back to shore yesterday was a stroll through the mall. I haven't looked yet on the gps to find out how far it was. It was dark and felt like a looooooong way. My fear is I find out it was only half a kilometre 'cause it felt like five.  Nice fish.
542963,Joey,2011-01-24 02:06:00,9122,"Jeez Emil, I feel for ya.  I remember doing alot of that kind of walking ice fishing many times.  That'll get you in great shape in no time  You caught fish tho and that's what you went for.  I'd have paid to see a woman cop pull you over  Joey"
542965,skeeter,2011-01-24 02:08:00,1907,"P.S. I begged 3 people on the way back to help me and give me a ride back to shore if going in the same direction telling them I'll pay them,....but no luck...was given all kinds of excuses....was left with very bad taste in my mouth for sure...  if they didnt have an extra helmet then they were not rude. not only do you get a fine but they get one too. i dont know if you were carrying your stuff or pulling a sleigh but if you had a sleigh the driver would have got another fine for not having a rigid tow bar on the sleigh.  but on the brighter side, nice catch."
542968,Jet,2011-01-24 02:12:00,364,"Nice stuff and just reward. When the fishing's hard, hard work is what will make the difference and you definitely worked hard!"
542970,SlowPoke,2011-01-24 02:18:00,2984,"It could have been worse, you could have been pulling my half dead body in the sled! I'm sure glad I didn't go with you!!!"
542976,Rizzo,2011-01-24 02:31:00,4754," after this post I don't think you ever will! 15 kms walking in these conditions you are a madman! Thank goodness your perserverance paid off. Congrats on a ""successful"" outing. The other day we went maybe 2 kms round trip walking and I thought that was a lot. You have raised the bar a LONG way!"
542978,Victor,2011-01-24 02:38:00,1609,"a couple of us were out today as well. it was COLD.  we fished shallower and only got into some perch. It was tough.  Good on ya for braving the elements and you sure were rewarded  be sure to bring the water next time though, being a few clicks away from shore, exhausted + dehydrated's not really a good thing"
542984,walleyemaster,2011-01-24 02:49:00,325,"nice catch emil, tastes better when you earn it"
542990,NANUK,2011-01-24 02:59:00,797,"Nice fish!!   A sloid effort for sure. ""I am out...laying down and breading deep"" That should take care of some aching muscles"
543007,danc,2011-01-24 03:37:00,4677,"This reminds me of a similar experience I had a year and a half ago. Twas a beautiful fall day so I decided to take a half day off work and do some Grouse hunting. I drove to a favorite walking trail and began the slow trek along the trail. I should mention that this trail is up hill all the way. Basically I was walking up a mountain. I'd been on this trail many times before but on this day I decided to walk further than I ever have before. I remember telling myself that I just wanted to see what was around the next bend. Finally, 4.5 k down the trail I decided that I'd had enough and started the long downhill walk back. Should be easier cuz it's all down hill, I thought to myself. It was much easier on the respritory system but my legs started to ache and burn as I held my weight back to prevent myself from falling flat on my face. I took several rest breaks, but my legs started to cramp up after the breaks so I decided to carry on without stopping. Well. If my truck was another 100 yards away, I swear that I wouldn't have made it! I was never so happy to get into my truck. After the half hour drive home I could barely walk from my truck to the house. Like you Emil, somehow a case of beer and a limit of Grouse made it seem worthwhile. But I learned a lesson that day. I'm not getting any younger."
543011,bigugli,2011-01-24 04:25:00,6138,Well done Emil.
543014,cityfisher,2011-01-24 04:51:00,959,"Good report, I was on lake rouseay today fightig the -35 weather , can't imagine walking out there , my sled froze to the ice /slush , tough weather . I would of gave u a ride , too bad there's a lot of grumps on simcoe"
543017,Sinker,2011-01-24 05:14:00,8692,"Glad you made it back OK Emil. Be careful out there, for god sakes. It would have been a nasty night out on that lake. 15km is a loooong ways. I've been in a couple situations out there as well.........don't count on passer-by's for help, most of them don't even blink an eye as they pass you by!!!  S."
543020,Jewelbee,2011-01-24 09:24:00,422,Your gonna enjoy that meal better than ANY other. So cold yesterday! Glad you made it back safe.
543030,ravinerat,2011-01-24 12:58:00,64,Now there are two well deserved Whities for sure. If you can't aford the snowmobile pick up some snowshoes Emil. They make the difference. Keep you out of the slush. Need water/gatoraid  big time on adventures like that. I'd have still given you a ride back on the snowmobile. Did on Sat with a guy who was trying to drag a fishtrap.

543044,Grimace,2011-01-24 14:06:00,2020,"Nice job on the fish.  15k wow.  The slush puts on a deep hurt.  I never would have been able to do it.  I was trying to visualize how far 15k was in relation with the area.  So I googled directions from Barrie to Innisfil and it is 14.7k.  I could not help but chuckle at the prospect of Barrie fisherman walking to Innisfil dragging their portables down Yonge Street because there is no parking in Innisfil.  lol   http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=barrie&rls=com.microsoft:en-ca:IE-Address&oe=UTF-8&rlz=1I7TSCA&redir_esc=&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=Barrie,+ON&gl=ca&ei=iIU9TbaKFsOC8gb55fzbCg&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ8gEwAA"
543048,moose,2011-01-24 14:30:00,266,Nice job Emil but what would have happened I'd the guy did give you a ride and broke down would u help Last yr I blew belt on atv a long way out in simcoe and not one guy walking stop and asked if they could help in any way And why would you walk so far out in extreme cold weather makes no sense at all This sport is you gotta pay to play

543110,daryl0815,2011-01-24 18:32:00,225,"wow, that sounds like a tough day of fishing, you are definitely tougher than I am, I didnt want to go out yesterday or today, maybe tuesday and wednesday..."
543134,misfish,2011-01-24 19:37:00,29133," When I had my sled,I gave a few guys a lift on the sled .I would let them walk the last 100 ft,due to I didnt want to get nailed for no helmets on them. No harm,no fowl.  Nice fish btw."
