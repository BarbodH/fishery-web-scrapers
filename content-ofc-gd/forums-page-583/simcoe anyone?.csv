But I have an extra seat in my hut and was wondering if anyone wants to get out tomorrow? If you don't have gear that's ok I have just about everything you would need. Will be getting on the ice at innisfil beach park at 6am if anyone wants to join me they are more then welcome My cell is 647-519-8965
