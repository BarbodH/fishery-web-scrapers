544892,Rich,2011-01-29 00:37:00,3927,"I see posts about beer on the ice, and fights on the ice.. but what are the restrictions of weed on the ice?  I mean, I was fishing a pond today, and the top of the ice was littered with weeds people had snagged through their ice holes. What's with that?  HEHEHEHEHEH"
544893,misfish,2011-01-29 00:39:00,29133,Only You would post this.  Too funny Rich.
544895,Twocoda,2011-01-29 00:40:00,4130,maybe they didnt catch any fish ...so they didnt need the salad
544900,Muskieman,2011-01-29 00:50:00,2472,"A lot of people bring garden rakes, bent to fit through the hole, to clear the weeds from under their spots.  I think that there's a fine for that."
544906,discophish,2011-01-29 01:09:00,392,You are right.  Seems to be lots of weed around.  And what about the people on snow?  So many these days.  Everywhere you look people are on snow.  No wonder people are having a tough time catching fish.  hehe
544911,Twocoda,2011-01-29 01:16:00,4130, Theres alot less snow in Las Angeles today ...i think it all melted in Charlie Sheens briefcase
544926,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-29 01:56:00,10439,Right!!! That does it!!! I'm coming right over and kick you in the ice hole!!!!!
544930,livinisfishin,2011-01-29 02:05:00,661,Lol way too funny
544944,shane,2011-01-29 02:32:00,652,LOL!  First it was 'beer on the ice'.  Then it was 'fights on the ice'.  Now it;s 'weed on the ice'.  I wonder what will be next on the ice.
544968,mercman,2011-01-29 03:22:00,7054,locally grown or imported
544976,Pigeontroller,2011-01-29 03:43:00,2793,I think the only thing that makes Ice fishing interesting is beer and weed(s)
