545106,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-29 16:57:00,10439,I want to thank Albert & Mike for going out of their way to pick me up a perfect little 4HP Merc from a seller in Whitby. Thanks guys couldn't have done it without you!!! I won't get to see it in person until my Attawapiskat trip in May but I can't use it until late May any way as things don't thaw up here until then. Hopefully I can get Mike to send me a few pictures of it.  Thanks again guys!!!!!
