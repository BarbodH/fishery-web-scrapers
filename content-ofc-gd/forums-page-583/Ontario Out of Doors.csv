544766,Jds63,2011-01-28 19:52:00,1365,"I just read a very interesting article in this months issue of Ontario Out Of Doors, regarding the amount of soft plastic baits being found in the bellies of Lake Trout and Brook trout (possibly other species)  It seems that the fish in the study had large amounts of un-digestable plastic baits in their bellies causing many of them to lose weight and eventually be susceptible to disease and predation.  I was under the impression that many plastics on the market quickly biodegrade but that does not seem to be the case. I actually have not been examining the stomach contents of the fish that I have eaten so this is surprising. I am not sure what bodies of water their research was done in however I am now more interested in seeing how many fish may be in this situation. I would suspect that heavily pressured lakes will contain more plastics than remote lakes.  The article goes on to explain that there is an estimated 20 million pounds of soft plastic baits lost each year in North American lakes and rivers.  How many of you have found plastic baits in the stomachs of the fish you have caught ? Do you see this as a potential serious problem ?"

544769,cram,2011-01-28 19:57:00,1733,I have actually wondered about it....but 20 million pounds!?!?!?!?
544772,solopaddler,2011-01-28 20:02:00,8605,"Fish in the St. Lawrence are doubly screwed then.  First they're sedated from all the prozac being flushed into the water by depressed Quebecers, then BAM, they slurp down a nice juicy plastic worm and they're all blocked up.  Lethargic and irritable, not a good combination for fish.     "

544777,mercman,2011-01-28 20:11:00,7054,  you always have the best answers
544778,mercman,2011-01-28 20:12:00,7054,  The black ones last forever though.Never figured out why
544780,Roy,2011-01-28 20:30:00,13728, That's cause the black ones are subbed out to Goodyear.

544801,GBW,2011-01-28 21:33:00,8460,I just read that too and that pic of the contents is crazy.  did you look at the size of some of those things?!?!?  I think all the brookie guys should be using bigger bait now too after reading that.
544809,Lunker Larry,2011-01-28 22:03:00,122,20 million lbs a year! I wonder if those figures are as accurate as the supposed tons and tons of led from split shot due to fishermen and hunters that was the scare a few years back. That was a farce. Maybe a year of fishing with exlax will help them out Keep smilin Larry
544812,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-28 22:19:00,390,"  Your quote is fishing related, wasn't Dorfman's nickname flounder?  Or am I just stating the obvious."
544852,GBW,2011-01-28 23:13:00,8460,the 20 Mil. a year has to be way off cause just think of how many years people have been using this type of bait with no study done.
544903,phiphntek,2011-01-29 01:06:00,115,I've been in his garage and you are correct.More plastic than Joan Rivers.
544946,bigugli,2011-01-29 02:33:00,6138,"The extreme volumes cited may not be so far fetched. How much soft plastic adorns the walls of your local tackle shop. Multiply that by every shop in North America. It adds up. Another disturbing problem with some of the plastics is that some actually expand in water.  The fish cannot pass the larger baits through their system. Every lost piece of plastic, just like every lost spoon, is still there."
544951,Roy,2011-01-29 02:41:00,13728,Don't worry about it...those plastics are biodegradable and will fit right in there with the pampers and WD40 to form the new world's outer crust.
545001,danc,2011-01-29 04:41:00,4677,99% of my Brookies are hooked like this. Nice and easy to release. Barbless to boot. I don't think that I've ever caught a Brookie on a plastic.

545015,camillj,2011-01-29 05:34:00,1988,Cant honestly say I have seen them in the belly of any fish I have eaten .. BUT ... I have caught many lakers which couched up three or four of(my) rainbow shiners ... and been snorkelling and found lots of half rotted plastics on completely rotted jigs .... so obviously the hooks dissolve faster than the plastics ... makes you think.
545052,scugpg,2011-01-29 13:47:00,1373, LOL funny but the more I read about these things I only consider eating fish from inland lakes and ponds isolated from heavy runoffs or pollution plants.
