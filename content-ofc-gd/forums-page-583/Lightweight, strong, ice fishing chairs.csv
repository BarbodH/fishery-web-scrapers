539493,bigugli,2011-01-14 22:41:00,6138,I have the same thing in a Rasta pattern for dem good vibes.
545064,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-29 14:52:00,2582,  Just to add...this chair is on for 8.99 at Canadian Tire this week...just noticed in the flyer now
545073,Rich,2011-01-29 15:29:00,3927,"Usually if I need a rest I flip my bucket over, lol"
545085,Beans,2011-01-29 16:15:00,3339, They are fairly light and the legs are aluminum (no rust)...   
539288,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 14:41:00,2690,"Currently have a couple of standard camping chairs for the hut.  I've searched google and have seen a few alternatives.  Wondering if any fellow OFNers have found reasonably priced alternatives? Must have back support, and, in my case, support a 6' 2"" frame weighing 230 lbs.  Cheers, Frank"
539290,Nipfisher,2011-01-14 14:51:00,2449,They had really good strong and lite folding chairs at Costco last year. I think they were $25-$35 each but well worth the money.
539292,skeeter,2011-01-14 14:58:00,1907,i use just regular folding card table chairs in my hut. and when traveling to and from the hut i lay them on there sides to help hold every thing in the sleigh.
539293,Sinker,2011-01-14 15:02:00,8692,White bucket!
539294,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 15:05:00,2690, Great back support on that one
539297,NAW,2011-01-14 15:07:00,4022,I use the smaller version of the folding camping chair.  They don't have arm rests.  I bought two of the camo one at crappy tire a year ago for $10 each on sale.  I use them for duck and sometimes turkey hunting too.
539302,I'mHooked,2011-01-14 15:18:00,525,I'd like to find where this HT chair is available on its own. At Lebaron it comes with a flip over and not seperately.  Anyone know where you can get one of these?  I'm 6'1 210 lbs and it was fairly comfortable. You're able to spread your legs out which can make it easier to get up from.  
539307,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 15:25:00,2690,  Not bad!!
539309,irishfield,2011-01-14 15:27:00,26272,"Just type HT sports chair in a google search...  Looks like the HT is sold out everywhere... but they make the exact same chair in Frabil and Eskimo badging, and looks like you can get them.."
539326,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-14 15:57:00,2582,http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/3/HouseHome/Furniture/FoldingChairsStools/PRD~0680340P/Folding%252BStool%252Bwith%252BBack%252BSupport.jsp?locale=en  I have removed the seating in both my portable huts and take this chair. I am a tad heavier then you  ...with no problems so far. On it's third season.  Beans and I also use the same chair for carp fishing in the summer. I know he has a few pictures of us sitting in them.  Keep an eye on the Canadian Tire flyers if you are not in a big hurry. They always come on for $9.99
539337,Governator,2011-01-14 16:28:00,879,I use a tripod chair from bass pro.  I find it very comfortable and very portable.  I use it for pretty much all camping/fishing trips.   http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Tripod-Chair/product/10210131/-1626008
539339,Nipfisher,2011-01-14 16:33:00,2449,I find the tri-pod chairs to be ball-breakers. No fun sitting all day with your junk squished.
539340,frozen-fire,2011-01-14 16:36:00,542, Bingo. Same ones I've been using.
539344,Beans,2011-01-14 16:46:00,3339, Like Steve sez...this stool like chair is much easier to get off of when your alarm goes off rather than struggling out of a camp chair...I've gone through 3 camp chairs the past few years no matter how strong they say they are but this one keeps on ticking...  Folds down for easier carrying...
539346,misfish,2011-01-14 16:50:00,29133,  Yep.  I had one of those.Broke on me.
539356,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 17:11:00,2690, 
539358,Roy,2011-01-14 17:13:00,13728, Sit on it backwards for a wedgie.
539364,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-14 17:38:00,0,Here's a neat one.. http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=1139364&type=product&WT.tsrc=CSE&WT.mc_id=nextag&WT.z_mc_id1=1139364&rid=40&mr:referralID=f2738e93-2004-11e0-ad8e-001b2166c62d
539365,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 17:40:00,2690," Yeah, I've seen that one before! Pretty slick, not exactly light weight, but, a cool idea."
539370,kickingfrog,2011-01-14 17:55:00,8333,   The left or the right one?  :rofl2:
539381,toca,2011-01-14 18:23:00,274, A friend of mine bought one exactly like that at basspro and i think he only paid 20 bucks after taxes.
539427,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 19:46:00,2690,"  Interesting alternative.  How's the weight, do the legs rust?"
539434,aplumma,2011-01-14 20:00:00,6896,The tripods may be o.k. on the ice but I bought one for the boat and it was good for less than 5 min. before my boys said uncle.   Art
539435,irishfield,2011-01-14 20:02:00,26272,I didn't realize you had kids Art....   What did they say to Joe...
539457,I'mHooked,2011-01-14 21:04:00,525," What, You don't were a cup with one of those umm...hand warmers in it?  Hmmm...think I've stumbled on the next great cross marketing idea! The Fishing ""Cup 'n Heater""  Tag Line: ""Keep your sons warm & protected from the hard knocks that stiff water fishing sometimes delivers""  Who's going to be the 1st to place an order?"
