544042,Dave Bailey,2011-01-27 01:37:00,1641,"I was thinking of adding a Scugog date to the Gals 'n' Pals tournament, but even though I've sent two e-mails to the township about using the Port Perry dock I've received no reply. Anyone got an 'in', or any ideas about who to get in touch with? I'd like to find out before printing up brochures for the spring fishing show."
544054,GBW,2011-01-27 01:51:00,8460,"I would reach out to Ron James, Dave Mercer and others to see if they know who to talk to (considering they live there).  Tried the folks at Goreski's or the bait shop on 7A?"
544326,GBW,2011-01-27 18:35:00,8460,"Dave, Ron is getting me a phone number for you.  Or at least he's trying to."

I looked quickly online and found this, it might find someone who can help out.  http://www.township.scugog.on.ca/parks_rec-culture.55.php  Daryl"

544558,Dave Bailey,2011-01-28 03:46:00,1641," Yeah, Parks and Rec were the ones I sent the e-mail to, maybe they're away for the winter, someplace where there's fish."
544706,GBW,2011-01-28 17:03:00,8460,"Here's Ron's reply... Hey bud, try calling Dave Stewart # 905-985-8698 for Port Perry weight in"
