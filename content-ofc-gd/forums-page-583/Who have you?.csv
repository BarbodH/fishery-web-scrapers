544560,fishdawg,2011-01-28 03:49:00,912,"been here for over 8 years i think now.... Have fished with & met off the water many kind folks here over that time frame. Though they(we) dont all post here very often nowadays, many of us are still very close & still fish together regularly.  Colin was the very 1st person I met from here & we spent a 2004 January day on Scugog. A couple weeks after that I then met folks like Pigeonfisher, Raf (boostnawd), DipLip, Cory, Joey & Paul, Speil, TEP, Ron, Bosc, YO, Lew, Rizzo (Roger) on Lake Simcoe at a little derby we did for Childrens Wish.  Aftr that I then soon met the ""bulk"" of most OFC regulars at Quinte, Lakair and the infamous ""Nip Trip"" at Rob Hyatts.  DanC, one day I'd like to make it up your way one day to chase speckles, tip beers & talk sports"

544739,Harrison,2011-01-28 18:21:00,2202,"Mr Misfish, we'll get that set up one year!  Met and fished with a few folks from OFC.  Learnt alot from the few times I have fished with Lew if I ever decide to target those toothy fish on purpose.  Had a fun weekend with Diplip, Lew, Cory and Reefhawg.  Highlight was meeting Corkys sister.  Went perching on the ice with a few guys too, they made fun of me and my swiss cheesing.  FishnSled and I have had some fun days.  And of course the BOQ GTG and one Nip trip I sort of remember.  Would love to hook up with Solo on some state side tribs and just sit and watch.  DanC for those awesome specks.  Ron, for his knowledge and success on Rice which is one of my favourite lakes.  And I'd love to film a show with Mercer, I think we could have a fun time playing off each other.  And Sir fish alot Steve, he reminds me of myself a few years ago on Simcoe, would love to get with ya and see how the lake is fished now.  Of course there is more, heck I'd fish with anyone, if they bring the Gweeches."

544750,lew,2011-01-28 18:47:00,12766, Probably the coldest night I've ever been lost in the woods in a truck with no heater
544760,Whopper,2011-01-28 19:32:00,2174,"Good thread, I've had the pleasure of fishing with or along side of a bunch of people here. Become good friends with a few folks that I have spent vacation time/fishing trips with. The first person I met was Maureen at Lakair after driving all night for the G2G, it was about 4:30am and I was sitting dockside drinking a beer, Lew was the second and Wayne put me up that weekend. I've spent a few trips with mistyriver and his family, always a great time. TennesseeGuy has put up with me for weeks at a time, I share his love for NWO  DanC, although I have never met personally (hopefully we can change that one day)he helped me out of a jamb one summer while I was in his neck of the woods   Paul if your up for it let's do it again this summer, I'll get Don on board  I agree Lew, I have yet to meet anyone here that I wouldn't invite into my home....well maybe not JP, don't think I keep enough beer in the frig  One of these days Andy  There's a few more here I would like to fish with, one never knows where I'll pop up"
544927,HTHM,2011-01-29 02:00:00,4082,"    For those who do not know the story, here it is:(I have learned a bit since that day) So the much anticipated weekend has arrived......I'm goin' up to the kawarthas to meet and greet some fellow OFC'ers. Big Cliff is first on the list. He sends me detailed directions....I have a GPS. Need I say more? Yes I do. I plug his address into the GPS, it finds it no problem at all. So up the 115\35 I go. I recall that I need to drive to the first light, la de da de da, I drive PAST the exit for 35 to Lindsay 'cause there is no light to be seen as of yet. When I get to the 7a exit I'm thinkin' (a rare thing for me), I didn't think I needed to drive all the way to Peterborough.....This is at 6:30 in the morning, Cliff said that he is up at 5 am every morning so I reluctantly decide to call. I wake up his wife, (an incredibly warm woman BTW), and she gets out of bed and goes to the top of the driveway into the shop and lets Cliff know that I need directions. (All of this time my GPS is telling me that I need to go back, but, NOOOOOOOO I know better because I remember the directions that Cliff gave me. Well to make a long story shorter, I managed to find his home, (nestled right on the shore of Sturgeon lake), and sat down to a coffee, while waiting for Beans, my fishing partner for the day. We laughed about my misadventures on the way up, and put that down to experience. Beans arrives, introductions are made, equipment compared, anticipation of a good day is in the air. The downpour had stopped, the sun was out, life is GOOD! So, off to the launch we go, the launch went smoothly, Beans is in my, (yet to be slimed), boat, with no trouble at all. I park the van and trailer, make my way to the boat, fire her up and help Beans into the dodge van captian's chair that I had mounted on the front bench seat of my 14' narrow beam boat. Now, a word about Beans.....Besides being one of the nicest and most worthy of respect men that I have had the pleasure of meeting, he is also an very experienced fisherman. He's gotta have 30+ years of experience on me. As well, he is a large man, in heart and goodnature as well as girth. OK here is the situation, an older, robust man sitting on a seat that is elevated 8 inches above the gunwales supported by a 10"" circular base fastened to a fiberglass bench seat . The base is 12"" high. Nothing wrong with that picture, right? So here we are on the lake; Beans has pulled in two perch, I am still waiting to get a bite. I ask Beans how he likes the seat, ""It is very comfortable"" he says. I am curious as this is the shakedown cruise with the new seat. I believe him and envy him as it does look very comfy. Beans leans back as he says this, and to my abject, unaldulterated, complete HORROR! he continues to lean back and back and into the drink he goes! I still have a vivid mental image of Beans' head entering the water, he completley upside down, still seated in the chair, legs kicking vainly in the air for some type of purchase, with a look of absolute shock and surprise etched into his face. Now at this moment in time I am thinking that I have killed him, he is going to drown, and it is my fault. So I do what any reasonable man would do, I panic. Thankfully he does not. Beans makes his way to the surface clutches at the side of the boat, and says something to the effect of "" That was interesting"", and I am thinking how the hell am I gonna get him back in??????!!!!! Fortunatly there are two men nearby in a bass boat, I call them over and they CALMLY get us cooled off, well Beans was already cool, he was IN the water after all, and get Beans into a life jacket, haul him into their boat, and transfer him back to mine. They were the true heros of the situation, regretably we did not get their names. (So if you recognize this situation, and lurk the board, THANK YOU!!!!!!) If you are members here, stand and be counted. During all of this Beans is concerned for me, because he can see the huge impact that this has had on me. I am not doing well.... Need less to say, that was the end of the outing. Beans I owe you an apology, and thank you very much for your freindship that was offered despite my attempt on your life. Cliff I appreciate the sage advice given after this incident, and will take it to heart. So, do I need to say anything about ALWAYS wearing your PFD????"

They include TJ, Limeyangler, TJSA and Brandon. I want to give special mention to one fantastic man that I met last year in Red Lake. TennesseeGuy. In our brief late night meeting, we talked about things such as fishing (of course), basketball and racing. Things that interest us both. I hope I haven't missed anyone in the ""have met"" list. There's a bunch of people that I'd really like to meet from OFC. Just because they seem like great people, I'd die to meet Roy, Mishfish, Joey and Paul, the Plummas, Lew, Terry, ChrisK, Whopper and Gerritt. I'm sure I missed a few here.

Hey Rob (kickingfrog), I wish I knew you fished back in highschool.  We could have got out a bunch of times. By the time I was 17 my dad let me take the boat out. I would just trailer it wherever and fish. I had a 16' with a 90hp motor and a bow mount and that was back in 1988 - 89.  Would have been a good time.

543910,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-26 20:23:00,0,"i haven't fished with anybody i didn't know already unfortunately but i cut my angling teeth for about a decade with Jay Hamilton, and bump into Kinger on hot summer nights on the St. Mary's.  i'd like to get fishing with anybody who will go but i'd definitely like to fish with the local guys; tdunn and dara, a day steelheading with solo, and i'd be pumped to throw some jig flies with DanC on The River."
543911,Headhunter,2011-01-26 20:24:00,5703,"i've been fortunate enough to fish with quite a few OFC'ers... and I can say that none that I have fished with, would be folks who I wouldn't do it again with! Now, who would I like to fish with is a much garded secret and those lucky few will receive that special invitation in due time.... HH"
543935,lew,2011-01-26 21:18:00,12766,In the nearly 9 years I've been on this board I've had the pleasure of sharing a boat with more than 60 OFNers.  Sadly most of them no longer post here but every one of them was a great guy and I still fish with a few of them.
543937,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-26 21:22:00,0,30 or more but they'll never admit to it....
543938,Sinker,2011-01-26 21:23:00,8692,"I've met and fished with many OFC'ers. Always a good time, and everyone I've decided to fish with has been solid. I could write a list, but that would take me too long, no time right now.  S."

543966,bigugli,2011-01-26 22:22:00,6138,"Thus far, I have only had the pleasure of fishing with BigCliff, crappieperchhunter, Emil and Vinnimom. I have met several over the past 3 years. I do hope to connect with a whole bunch more this coming year."
543971,solopaddler,2011-01-26 22:32:00,8605,"I met BillM through the board and we've become close friends.  Can say the same about a few others as well: Spiel, CCMT, Highdrifter, HTHM, Jay Hamilton, Moosebunk,TonyB, BenBeattie, dobee, Basskicker, Justin Elia, aniceguy, and good 'ole Skud.   Did I miss anyone? (Highly probable  ).  I'm sincerely looking forward to meeting Gerritt, lookinforwalleye, and kickingfrog when we do our fly in this September.  Brian (Misfish) you're welcome to join me anytime!  Honestly this is the best aspect of the OFC board. The quality of the people is second to none and I've made lifelong friends because of it.  Who would I like to fish with? The list is too long.  There's a bunch I've been trying to get together with for a while (you know who you are  )  Hopefully this year!"
543983,camillj,2011-01-26 23:04:00,1988,Fish ?  Ohhhhhhhh .. I thought we just talked about it
543985,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-26 23:06:00,1107,I have fished with all the fish-a-thoners and hope to keep meeting new OFNER's in the years to come at future fish-a-thons .  as far as who I would like to fish with well any of the steelheaders that want to share a drift I'm game.  I would love to hit simcoe for smallies this year so anyone that would like to show me the ropes would be awesome(My boat or yours)   I usually have a open seat availible so if anyone wants to do some LPB pike fishing in the spring shoot me a PM and we will try to make it happen .This site is really a great bunch of fisher people with a tonne of expertise and a great Mod squad!
543986,BillM,2011-01-26 23:08:00,17367,"I've met some really great people on this site and have made some extremely close friends because of it.  Mike and I are always on some crazy adventure together and I'd never trade those (good or bad) for anything.  I'm not one of these guys whose got a page full of 'friends', I have about a dozen people I consider good friends and a large part of that list was populated directly or indirectly because of this site.  It's kinda of crazy when I sit back and think of it."
543993,kickingfrog,2011-01-26 23:44:00,8333,"I have had the plesure to have fished with:  b2kptbp no photo and Grimace no photo  Irishfield   Glen     Speil  ChrisK   Slowpoke   Heck I'll even include Roy and greencoachdog, although they would let me on their boat   Met many more at G2G and events Lakair 2008   Fishing for Tyler 2009  "
