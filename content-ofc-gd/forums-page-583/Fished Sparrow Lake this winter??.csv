I have a cottage on Sparrow Lake and havent been up all winter (we dont have running water).. and was wondering if anyone has been up on that lake fishing this seasons and if so, how were the results??  I went perch fishing the other day at Terry Goy ice huts, on Simcoe.... We caught a few jumbos but nothing more.. Saw a MASSSIVE carp swarming the perch, and we were all jigging for it but it just wudnt move. It just sat there and stared and then after about an hour swam away. Thing must've been at least 30lbs. Was HUGE.  I plan on going for some ice fishing for whities on simcoe next, anyone got some good spots they can recommend? (Link me a GPS location on google maps)"
