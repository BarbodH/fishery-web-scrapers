Its always said that the Heat of the game is responsible for this behavior, for most of these incidents........but theres 4 other guys on your line and a goalie that are in the same ""heat"" and control themselves. I dont buy that excuse.......its one thing to have a one on one knuckle buster........and another to stomp on a guy with your skate wehn he cant even see you, or swing your stick like a bat into some guys mouth. If ya got an issue, throw the gloves face to face........duke it for a bit and get on with the game. Have fun sittin and watching the next 30 Chrissy!"

Alot of the old-time fighters were there for one reason only,but Simon's pretty good out in front of the net and can play some minutes. That said, there is no place in the league for the crap he's pulled in the last couple years. I say oust him and set an example."
