143990,kayak fisher,2007-12-19 19:59:00,66,"Hey all,  Can anybody tell me what the ice situation is like around Virginia Beach? I am thinking of heading out there tomorrow to do some perch fishing, but only if the ice is safe. The Weather network is predicting that Sutton will be -6 from tonight until tomorrow afternoon, when it will warm up to -3.  Any help is, of course, greatly appreciated!  Anyone else going up there tomorrow?"
143999,motv8tr,2007-12-19 20:26:00,2587,"It's been raining alot up here today, and not much ice in Barrie.  I'd call one of the hut operators and ask them, they'll be your best bet for accurate info...  Maureen"

144002,kayak fisher,2007-12-19 20:44:00,66,"Thanks, cool pic.  Kinda hard to see how frozen the edges are (looks like there is no ice at all!)  Maybe I should bring my kayak?"
144005,huntervasili,2007-12-19 21:08:00,1604,"Cooks is frozen over, and Virginia Beach is frozen as well. although some people have been out the warm temps are melting snow on top and thinning the ice. Good or bad the Ice is pretty unsafe"
144010,lookinforwalleye,2007-12-19 21:22:00,4399,See Lew`s post and bring your water wings just in case!
144060,daisy_girl58,2007-12-19 23:11:00,116,We are going tomorrow to Virginia Beach(Thursday)...was on Cooks Bay by the glenwood yesterday and it was very thick a good six inches we drilled through.....Called Dave's ice huts and he said no problems it was nice and thick...he has his huts up and going......So will see you tomorrow maybe.....Good Luck!  Lorissa & Omegaman  PS I just found this also  http://www.lakesimcoemessageboard.com/ice.php  was told to check it today.....
144088,lookinforwalleye,2007-12-20 01:29:00,4399,Above average temps for the next few days mixed with rain could change that.
144097,huntervasili,2007-12-20 02:09:00,1604,"Lorissa... make sure to look at the dates, It says up to 14"" of ice in now open water, it is from last winter, or spring... may soon be updated but its outdated"
144102,mbac31,2007-12-20 02:40:00,904,That was from last year. It needs to be updated for sure.
144130,motv8tr,2007-12-20 12:05:00,2587,"If you insist on going, be very careful.  On the news this morning they were showing York Region Police testing the area of Virginia Beach, and there was lots of slush, a bit of ice and they said there sensors show water is coming up through the snow.  Maureen"
144329,kayak fisher,2007-12-21 04:38:00,66,"Thanks for all your responses.  I decided not to go out this morning, better safe than sorry.  It felt like it was about 10 C in Toronto today, definitely not good for making ice.  I did manage to get something done today though.  I went down to active surplus and picked up some buzzers, switches and batteries. Now all of my tip ups will give out an audible signal to let me know that I have a fish!  No more lost tip ups, although my neighbours on the ice might get irritated by the sound.  Cheers"
144361,Uncle Buck,2007-12-21 14:47:00,1000,for some reason the one guy on simcoe who uses a buzzer while perch fishing always has to pop a hole close to me...  Why do you need a buzzer when you're perch fishing ???
144384,kayak fisher,2007-12-21 16:51:00,66,"Yeah, a buzzer would not be needed for fishing perch.  But then again perch aren't really big enough to pull a tip up down the hole so I figured that was obvious.  The buzzer will be used for whities and lake trout,  and usually if someone is fishing close enough to me to hear the buzzer it is because they saw me catch a fish and decided to drill some holes right next to me.  With all of the internal combustion engines on simcoe (augers, atvs, sleds, vans, cars, pick-ups etc....) I don't think that a buzzer should be that bothersome.  Happy fishing."
