144165,Puckhead,2007-12-20 15:07:00,377," Nonesense.  You think that minor (as in kids) hockey was less violent in the 80's or 90's???? It's far safer and tamer today than it has ever been.  Hockey parents and coaches were just as insane back then, if not more so. It just wasn't news worthy then.  Hockey is a multifaceted sport and is violent in nature. 200+ lb guys smashing into each other full speed will get the agression level cranked up on both benches. If you want a non violent game (i.e. non contact), there are a variety of local leagues out there that you can watch in your neighbourhood arena.  Removing aggression changes the entire face of the game. Aggression is the driving force behind the emotion of the game - which a big part of why I love it, when I think about it a bit more. Just because Chris Simon is an idiot, doesn't mean there is anything wrong with the game, nor does it mean it's going to go by the way of the dodo bird either. Anyone remember the movie slapshot?"
144169,big guy,2007-12-20 15:25:00,414,"It really gets under my skin when people slag a guy like Don Cherry. Yes, the guy is old school, but you know what, old school is far better than the new school. The single biggest problem with society today is political correctness and the apologists who gave birth to it and continue to nurture it. Don Cherry doesn’t apologize for anything, he has principals, values and dare I say, COMMON SENSE. When he believes in something he lets you know about it, the man wears his emotions on his sleeve. Why is that a crime?  We’re in the state we are today with our politics and justice system because somewhere along the line someone decided that the old way of doing things, the way we and our fathers and mothers were raised was wrong. Why?  Cherry always comes across like he’s mad about something because he’s sick and tired of being the only one carrying the torch. Do you really think the CBC, the Liberal, politically correct bastion that our tax dollars props up, really wants him on their network, hell no? The only reason he’s there is for ratings, in other words money and because of the public outcry there would be if they fired him.  If you ask me, we need more Don Cherry’s in the world."
144170,lew,2007-12-20 15:31:00,12767," Absolutely Puckhead, and I can attest to that fact all the way back into the 50's when I was playing house league hockey.  Kids are kids and hockey has always had fights in the little  leagues, at least in any that I played in, it's just that every parent wasn't holding a video cam and recording everything for the world to see.  I know 2 young fathers today that refuse to allow their 9 year sons to play hockey because they feel it's too violent and I think that's pretty sad.  I haven't seen an NHL game in 40 years so I have no real opinion on it, but I think violence is part of the game until it goes overboard and players are deliberately trying to mame others, then it's time to step in and come down hard on them."
144171,Chris,2007-12-20 15:31:00,405,Grimace:  Well said. Holdfast and cookslav make some good points too.
144190,Hookset,2007-12-20 17:11:00,367,"or....  Is this all just a reflection of how respect for our fellow humans has deteriorated in every aspect of life.  I don't think the problem is the current style of hockey. Look around, read the paper, go watch a kid's hockey game. I have been to several of my Nephew's hockey games over the years. He's ten now. The parent's are brutal. I could go on for hours but I don't have that long. Respect starts at home, and equips us with how we deal with everything we do in life. How we treat people at work, how we deal with our neighbours, and how we play Hockey.  I played hockey my whole life up until a few years ago. There was respect when I was a kid. The level of ""verbal abuse"" from parent's today is unreal. There is absolutely no way that would have been tolerated when I was a kid. And I can back that statement up. Imagine what these kids go through when you don't see them in public.  Change the rules all you like, Hell, take away the puck, insert a ring and we can call it ringette. And players will still be doing the same as we are discussing in fact it will continue to get worse.  Cuz' it ain't about the rules, it ain't about suspensions, it's about respect. If you don't learn that growing up, you sure won't learn it when you're a spoiled millionaire ""kid"" playing a ""kid's"" game.  It's gonna get worse....   Hookset.   P.S.----Don Cherry for P.M."
144273,holdfast,2007-12-21 00:18:00,1813,"All that crap, of kicking, biting, pinching, crying, diving,cowarding, using your stick, mouthing off when the ref is in between, has all been imported.  Kind of spreading like a disease.  Kind of like watching the academy performances of the soccer players not too long ago.  Yea and I like Cherry also and I agree on a lot of things that he has said in the past.  Says it like it is, even if he has to put up with the bull political correctness.  And as far as Simon is concerned, never did hear him turn down a fight.  I guess lately all he has to face are players that wont drop the gloves.  Buy the way, his previous suspension was way more severe.  All I can picture is Rutu squirming and barking like a seal on the ice.  I shake my head on how the game has deteriorated."
144274,Zamboni,2007-12-21 00:23:00,235,"Kids hockey is far cleaner that the game was 20-30 years ago. Much less hooking-slashing and interference, its a faster game. The kids are skating much better than their parents did-that statement may bother some but measured times in every imaginable drill set are much faster. There is much less fighting now, especially peewee division and younger. Many who played the game saw far worst incidents in their own childhoods than the NF-Dufield fiasco....as Lew mentioned, nobody was filming. Fighting was far more acceptable when we were kids and is not a rare occurence on old gamesheets. I've had 1 player get a fighting major in 5 years coaching, admittedly a few amongst teamates in practises also. Anyone playing kids hockey late 70's early 80's was probably in at least 1 scrap and had a few teamates who fought often. Many kids today reach bantam hockey without even seeing a fight.  Parents loud & obnoxious....yep-far worse."

144379,bbog,2007-12-21 16:19:00,665,"A ""tough guy"" faces his willing adversary face-to-face. This act was from a cheapshot artist whose time in the NHL is way past overtime!  The league does have to take some responsibility for allowing him to play after his last major infraction AND for allowing the RUUTUs of the game to s**t disturb and then turtle."
144121,Cookslav,2007-12-20 05:51:00,1457,"Simons a goon...plain and simple, and he got what he deserved IMO Lucky he didn't get more given his track record.  The league acted accordingly by setting a precedent IMO. I personally like the fighting...that’s right, I'll be honest. Nothing wrong with 2 guys dropping the gloves when they have a dispute on the ice. its settled, and its dealt with up front in your face, no bertuzzi cheap shot broken necks, no Chris Simon 2 handers to the face, no Samuelson knee jobs, and no Tie Domi Elbows....  2 guy solo solving a dispute. The Stick play, the cheap shots...that stuff is cowardice Garbage. Hockey has always had fights, and always will....and I hope it continues Why you ask?  Cause The emotional overdrive of the game is what turns my crank... The split second decision, the slamming into the boards, the frustration, the pain, the guts & the glory...that’s what I love about the game. If 2 guys who want to drop the gloves in the heat of the moment to settle the score, and rally the team, the crowd, and the sports life blood...so be it  But to stomp on a guys leg when he's down while he's in a helpless position, an not expecting it...that’s Garbage. That’s cowardice, and its the crap that spoils this great sport. Throw him out IMO.  Penalize the cowards, and the dirty crap so severely it stops, but leave the passion in the game. Let them Fight, let them hit, let them muck it up, and let them be emotional...but remove the Garbage  I still say Minor Hockey has got it right. Introduce a ""intent to injure"" penalty. The cost is simple.... You injure a player in Malice, you sit every game the Injured player does, then serve a suspension of 25% of the remaining season once that injured player returns, a 2nd offence is 50%, and third offence is a Life ban on the game. If that was in play the Players would think twice about this stupid crap. And guys like Bertuzzi would be retired.  But don't put a fight between 2 willing sportsman on the same page as what Simon did. Fighting in Sports may be wrong to some, but my guess is those same people don't get Boxing either. Like it or leave it thats the Score IMO"
144122,JohnF,2007-12-20 06:05:00,3494,"For what it's worth I think Simon has outlived his usefulness to the NHL, and for his sake and the league's he should be retired. I'm sympathetic to the case of tough guys though. I think they're part of hockey. But somewhere along the line, I think it might have been in Philly, the tough guys were suddenly promoted into the limelight and hockey hasn't been quite the same since. There have been a lot of rules, written and unwritten, that have evolved out of that promotion of the tough guys - like protecting the stars, no clutch and grab, checking from behind, bloodletting, etc. Another unfortunate aspect is that these high profile shenanigans have attracted the attention of the courts and we're seeing on-ice infractions being tried in court. What it amounts to is that the tough guy is becoming a dinosaur in the league and the pests like Ruutu & Avery are going to rule the ice. If people like McCown have their way, the tough guys will all be out of the game soon. I get the impression he didn't exactly grow up playing the game. I could be wrong.  I think it's unfortunate because hockey was meant to be played tough and physical. The pests wouldn't be so pesky if they were fair game for some of the tough guys, but there's a move afoot to protect them, albeit inadvertently. Soon hockey's gonna resemble ice dancing with sticks & trash talk.  JF"
144126,misfish,2007-12-20 10:34:00,29133,"Hey G I remember that game very clearly. Well kinda,I think I was on my 5th drink by the 2nd period.LOL   One comment that was made is correct The game was meant to be played rough and tough,but the extra curricular stick and skate crap is not hockey. Yep, he has over stayed aswell. Thats where I give Domi credit,he knows the tough guy way is being pushed to the side.  BTW Don S Cherry is losing it, I will say that,but I dont think there is anyone more involved and takes the game to heart like he does.Very patinate man. Did I ever mention I had lunch with him and Rose. Franks and beans. Simple man. He has become abit of a show boat as of late though."
144137,big guy,2007-12-20 12:53:00,414,"I for one didn't think the ""stomp"" was near as bad as his stick to the head incident last year. Cripes, you hear the word ""stomp"" and it sounds like he jumped up in the air and came down with all his weight on the guys foot, nothing could be further from the truth. He half-assed stepped on the guy without any more force than you would use to clear the snow off your boot... big deal.  The real problem with the NHL is that they let guys like Koivu, Pronger etc, off with nothing for doing exactly the same thing guys like Simon get 25 and 30 games for. Why cause his name is Saku Koivu, or because it's his first offence? What a load of crap... it shouldn't matter who does what, or how many times, suspend them all for the same amount of time. Where is the deterent for guys like Simon when we can all see there are clearly two sets of rules at play.  And as for the league cleaning itself up, back in the day when you could punch a guy out for being a pest, or taking liberties, it was a lot cleaner than it is now. Is it cleaner now because there is less fighting... hardly, there is more stick work, more cheap shots and less respect than ever before, why the hell do you think so many players wear visors? How many NHLer's wore visors back in the 70's when the Flyers were pounding every thing in sight? And how many brawls did you see between 7 and 8 year olds?  The reason why minor league kids are getting into fights is because everything around them is more violent than it was when I was growing up and the ""adults"" don't take responsibility for anything anymore, always pointing the finger at the other guy. When I was a kid, I played outside, now a days they sit in the front of the damn TV watching violent shows, or playing violent games. Guys like Don Cherry are few and far between, trying to teach kids to respect each other when on the ice, who do you think started the ""THINK"" patches that are on the backs of all the jerseys.  It's time for many of us to grow up and start being accountable for our actions, in every facet of our lives. If a guy like Simon does something stupid, yes, he must take responsibility for it, but the NHL must also do their part in seeing that ""every"" player is held accountable."
144152,Cookslav,2007-12-20 14:23:00,1457," Bingo!  Now instead of stepping up and settleing the score face to face you have guys taking Cheap shots trying to get even with another player ""Under the Radar"" and avoiding the the fight. Problem there is... A fight is mutual, and it leaves 2 guys with a sore face & fists...thats about it. But with A quick jab of the stick, a stomp of the skate, a hit from behind or what have you people get seriously hurt."
144153,lew,2007-12-20 14:33:00,12767,I'm still wondering why a hockey player earns more money than a brain surgeon ??
