144191,JorgeCarlos,2007-12-20 17:13:00,109,"here is what i have,what are the bigger jigs and spoons good for??  "
144194,DANIMAL,2007-12-20 17:21:00,215,"Any predator fish species (walley, pike, trout, whitefish.......)"
144202,huntervasili,2007-12-20 17:55:00,1604,"I will second that Danimal... The smaller Williams spoons are good for trout through the ice, the heavier ones would be good for eyes and the smaller jigs for perch and crappie"
144276,kuhaman,2007-12-21 00:31:00,503,Bigger fish!
144282,Dabluz,2007-12-21 00:51:00,701,Fish with bad eyesight.
144283,Clampet,2007-12-21 00:53:00,1947,The bigger (heavier) ones are ideal for deeper (40' or more) water.
144286,OhioFisherman,2007-12-21 00:59:00,6623,"I don`t ice fish, but the jigging rapala type lures will work in the open water seasons too. I have even caught catfish on them."
144306,Riparian,2007-12-21 02:53:00,269,That is quite a mix bag of lures. Did you aquire them as some sort of package deal? I see some name brands in there.
144326,JorgeCarlos,2007-12-21 04:21:00,109,"no really, i have them for some time and always buying more when i find something i like."
