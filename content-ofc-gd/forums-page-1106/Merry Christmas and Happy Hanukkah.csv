We'll be there for 8 days.  (help me...PLEASE help me!!! LOL).  Should be lots of fun...presents on Tuesday...and they have even planned for my little one going on her first horse ride.  Anyhow...to all that are travelling, please be safe... I truly hope that everyone has a wonderful holiday.  See you again just before new years.  Take care all!  Cliff and Bly"
