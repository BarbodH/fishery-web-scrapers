144471,Greencoachdog,2007-12-22 00:55:00,8163,"You can't hardly go wrong with a Columbia, especially if it's made with the Veertex outer fabric... I have a bunch of their stuff! The summer wear keeps me cool and dry in the heat and the winter wear keeps me warm and dry in the cold."
144474,Guest Fishing For Life,2007-12-22 01:26:00,0,Am I the only one who gets completely confused with Columbia stuff?  Went to SportsChek and there were millions of them and they were all on sale?  any recommendation?  Can I dip the columbia jacket in the water as if it is a wader and it will still work?  Thanks

Be sure to use thermal clothing right next to your skin...it will wick away sweat.  If you feel wet (sweat) then you're done for.  Just layer up and wear an outer shell that really protects from the wind...a hood is best so the wind cant get down the back of your neck.  The next most important thing is boots....same thing...wear socks that will wick away sweat....cause if your feet are cold then you're done for.  Good luck!
144508,sharper,2007-12-22 03:58:00,279," Most of the columbia jacket you see at sport chek is for snow boarding but they are warm. Get one that is 2 layer, one is the outer shell for wind/water and a inner fleece layer that is removable. I have columbia jackets and north face jackets both of which are really good.  You can interchange the inner layer, one of the warmest combination so far has been a columbia wind/water shell with a north face 650 down jacket as the inner layer."
144510,trapshooter,2007-12-22 04:08:00,1234,"I'm personally not a columbia fan.  A Gore-tex (or another waterproof breatheable alternative) outter shell jacket with layers underneath is a solid choice.  You can layer-up or down depending how cold it is and the Gore-Tex is guaranteed dry.  One of the biggest things I look for in an all weather jacket is the quality of the hood and how waterproof the zippers are.  Also, as sharper said a downfill jacket under a waterproof layer is a very warm and dry combination."
144573,troutologist,2007-12-22 14:47:00,951,"I 2nd the gortex shell system. I have found it to be the best even for ice fishing etc. Just have to wear a fleece and 1 or 2 other layers underneath. As ccmt stated if you sweat youre done, dont wear all your layers if you have a walk to your spot type deal. Also I think you'll find if you wear waders it keeps you quite warm (minus youre feet)"
144584,DANIMAL,2007-12-22 15:27:00,215,"Layers of fleece or wool and a waterproof breathable outer layer. Just watch out for some of the cheaper jackets that claim to be 100% water proof, They are but only for about the first 10 or so times wearing them and then they start to leak."
144590,trapshooter,2007-12-22 15:54:00,1234,"Also, your base layer (i.e. the layer next to your skin) should be a material that wicks moisture away from your body.  Look for Marino wool, cool max or polypropylene material.    There's also some garments with bamboo fibre, which is supposed to be good for wicking."
