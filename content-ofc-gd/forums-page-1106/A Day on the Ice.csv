Near shore areas were soupy due to water over the ice. The ice is still a thin so be cautious. We thoroughly checked the ice with our chisel as we crossed the lake.  We only spent three hours on the ice and moved a couple times. Fishing was good. Lots of short strikes and soft taps. We managed 3 nice rainbows and a couple small perch. Two of the rainbows weighed about 1 lbs and the other was about 2.5lbs. Fish were caught in 15 FOW near bottom. Belly contents showed the fish were eating invertebrates off bottom."
