144417,Kawartha Kev,2007-12-21 19:51:00,281,I just recieved my winter edition of Ontario Out of Doors and noticed an ad saying the Spring Fishing Show has closed. I know the magazine was a major sponsor of the show but I hadn't heard anything about the show closing can anyone confirm this? Maybe Ontario Out of Doors is just not participating in it as the ad says they will be at the Toronto Sportsmen Show. I know the Spring Fishing Show was going downhill but it was still a nice break in the middle of winter to get out and see some fishing stuff and it did tend to have some better retailers than the Sportsmen's Show I thought hopefully some of them will go down to the Sportsmens Show if the Spring Fishing Show is in fact closed.

144423,bassman,2007-12-21 20:18:00,384,It appears that they have combined forces with the Sportsmen's Show  http://www.springfishingshow.ca/
144425,irishfield,2007-12-21 20:30:00,26272,But like all shows of it's kind in Toronto... someone has replaced it already with the spring Boat and fishing show. Same place... same free parking..
144426,Kawartha Kev,2007-12-21 20:32:00,281,Thanks BASSMAN interesting reading. I did some checking around on the net and there is still a show at the International Center called the Fishing and Boat Show scheduled for Feb.16 -17 I believe not many details are listed though.  Kawartha Kev
144428,Mark Kulik,2007-12-21 20:39:00,348,"Andy Palotta from CSFL  -Bassmania Tournament trail is running it this year same place, more fishing and boating oriented-I agree I've always liked this show-see you there.  Mark"
144443,danbo,2007-12-21 22:14:00,2646,Alot of vendors are fed up with the high cost for booth space. The Sportsman's Show is such a great tradition..too bad all the $$ gouging & greed is whittling it all away! JMHO!
144445,kennyman,2007-12-21 22:26:00,737,"I can't wait for the show. I just checked and the combined show in March is the exact same weekend as the Performance World car show. I'll be working that,so I'm very glad that the Fishing and Boat Show is on Feb 15,16,17th. I can at least go to one. I will be Jones'n by then and anything about fishing will be fine with me. I'm hoping it's even better."
144452,iceguy,2007-12-21 23:03:00,341,"The show's need better deals, maybe not the vendors fault cause of booth cost. BPS has super deals(doorcrashers) when the sportman show is on."
