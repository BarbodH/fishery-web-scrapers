Never caught anything there in the winter.  If you go, pay particular attention to where the river comes in, it's a very fast current and thin ice at best."

144769,irishfield,2007-12-23 15:05:00,26272,Here ya go... from John Stanton  Hi Wayne. The ice on Sparrow is quite safe ( away from the River) but right now there is a load of slush on top. This mild weather should bring the water to the surface then re-freeze hopefully for good conditions going forward.
