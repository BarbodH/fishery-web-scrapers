144327,kentooley,2007-12-21 04:29:00,208,Hi all  Picked up my Islander Steelheader today(silver) and I think I have a deal for 2 rods tomorrow (12'9 Matrix & a 14' Raven im8). Perfect timing for the mild weekend.  Now all I have to do is learn how to cast.  Anyone else steelheading this weekend?  Chris
