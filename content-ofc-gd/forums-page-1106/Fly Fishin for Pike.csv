Troutfitters could help you out with equipment http://www.grandrivertroutfitters.com/Abou...pagewelcome.htm  They do some guiding for toothy critters as well..."
144462,highdrifter,2007-12-21 23:43:00,2534,"Excellent!  All you need is a stout 9ft 8 or 9 wheight (you can cast longer with an 8 wheight, but a 9 wheight packs a better punch for casting those wet socks).  Leaders may come with a with shock tippet, but making your own is fairly easy. 80lb Flurocarbon is a good replacement, but adds a bit more bulk and flies may not be as boyant in the water. Flies include bunny leeches, deceivers, zonkers, surface and sub-surface deerhair patterns.  Get 'er done!  tight loops HD"
