Dude was sitting on his porch enjoying a cold one,  & the bear ran right across his front lawn, not 15' away.  We also had one swim across that small channel out in front of us last summer."

Saw evidence of their whereabouts a couple of times...once on my neighbors property where it was after the apples that had fallen from the trees and once on my property where it had knocked the heavy top section off my woooden garbage box and helped itself to a smorgasborg of ""stuff""...then had a humoungas crap on my back driveway...I thought they went in the woods ???"
