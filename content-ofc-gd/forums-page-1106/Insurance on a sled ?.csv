143096,cityfisher,2007-12-16 15:36:00,959,"Hi all,  Can anyone give me a parkpark range on insurance an older smaller 2 track sled ??? ARound $1000 for the season ?"
143099,Dondorfish,2007-12-16 15:46:00,1000,"There was a post a few weeks back about snowmobile insurance - try and search it out. For the type of machine you are talking about, your insurance will probably run you under $200/yr without theft, and around $300 mark with theft.   Don"
143138,musky66,2007-12-16 17:19:00,273,I run a '92 and a '93 Formula Plus. Had insurance for years with collision and paid about $200 each a year. This year they tell me I need an appraisal for the '92( 15 years old I guess) Well I now only have liability on each- If they get broken up or stolen I'm done with sleddin' just want to avoid costly lawsuit if my son or I am at fault. Insurance is the biggest scam- next to the oil companies!
143141,Dondorfish,2007-12-16 17:23:00,1000,Scam or not - get caught on the ice or trails ( or any public place ) without it and the fine will be more then the insurance!    Don

143320,Riparian,2007-12-17 05:46:00,269,I pay 260 for my 97 skidoo 440 mxz. Keep in mind I am 23 years old.
144239,mistyriver1,2007-12-20 21:03:00,600,"I pay around $240 a year for a 97 Skidoo 670 two up.  If you have your car, house, boat ?? all with one place, that might help."

144264,Tybo,2007-12-20 22:48:00,1373,I was just quoted $300 for collision and liability on my 95 Yamaha two up and trailer for the year.  Joey
144284,Dabluz,2007-12-21 00:54:00,701,"Here in Quebec, vehicle insurance is way cheaper.  For a snowmobile or ATV etc (without collision), it's about 50 dollars."
144290,John Bacon,2007-12-21 01:28:00,3277," These is such a thing... my brother wrenched is knee in one.  It had two tracks, one ski, and the engine was in the back."

144305,Muskieman,2007-12-21 02:50:00,2472,In 1996 I bought a new Mach 1 AND PAID 86$ A YEAR FULLY LOADED.  I sold the MACH in '01   and bought  a  1994 Safari Rally 503 2up for fishing.. in 2002 I paid 202.26$ for 03-04  and in 05-06  I paid 243.60$ ... I have since sold it.  Imagine that ..Arctic Cat is thinking of introducing the 1500cc  240 hp  supercharged V6  that they  put in their PWC ....In a sled...!!!! STUPID!!!  It'll be uninsurable  ...  I remember when  If you had a Blizzard 9700  ...  you were crazy  !  it was a 521cc nowadays if you don't have at least a 600cc you can't keep up.. dang crazy.  Who remembers when the Big Red 250cc Shaft Drive withe Reverse was the best ATV around now BRP & Cat have  or soon to have a 1000 cc ATV..????  People want power ... power needs to be insured ... insurance & CC's  cost money....must pay to play...apparently more dangerous..sorry to say ... they have us by the nutsack.  Who's making the cash now???  We're getting ripped off!
144389,ecmilley,2007-12-21 17:28:00,2163,"guess it depends on the insurance company and the sled your running, the old beater sled i had a 440 ss yamaha was around 200 bones a year and my 998cc apex is 395 full coverage a year. If you have a valid permit you can get the beleivers plus insurance as well thats supposed to save you a bundle if you have a good driving record."
144487,Roger,2007-12-22 02:27:00,2,"I've got three sleds, 82 bravo 250, 95 440 jag, and a 2000 grand touring 600, all $126.00 ea. for basic liability through Primmum insurance company. For some reason ATV's are different with them but still very reasonable."
