I thought to myself... $30 for shipping or $65 for PST... I'll pay for shipping.  So now the wait begins for my new bang bang. I'll post updates on my experience as it occurs.  cd.  update... I called the CFC today just before closing to see if the transfer on the gun has been started... imagine that... it hasn't. Secondly a charge to my credit card hasn't been made yet. I know it's Christmas and all, but if everyone else has to work hard to make it good for everyone so should they. I am mildly disappointed at this point, I would have expected them to begin the transfer process after 2 working days."
144501,taper,2007-12-22 03:30:00,611,Corey where did you order it from? I myself just purchased a stainless Weatherby in 300 WSM in a kit with sling hard case and scope. Can't wait to get it out and do some target practice.

144532,topraider,2007-12-22 12:43:00,30,Am I missing something here? shipping OR gst? I expect you'll pay both. and pst to boot.
