144779,Tybo,2007-12-23 15:40:00,1373,When I back troll with my full wind shield. I use the drift sock off the bow. This stops the wind from flinging the bow around and I don't have to work the steering wheel as much to stay straight.
144781,tjsa,2007-12-23 15:58:00,1578,"Gerritt, backtrolling is a staple tactic up here. We fish a lot of lakes that are not very big, and mostly for walleye. Backtrolling is all about boat control, pulling instead of pushing. Pulling your way along a weedline, shoal, etc., while watching the distance from said weedlines, shoals, and keeping an eye on the sonar at the same time for depth control, it is much more advantageous than trolling forwards. In wind conditions that are a bit sketchy, and sometimes not, we throw a 3-5 gallon bucket out the nose of the boat, tied to the front of the boat to slow us down, and to control side winds hitting the boat that could cause us to have difficulty with control. If wind conditions are too much, we still use the bucket, but we do a troll along a path, then retrieve the bucket, motor up-wind a few hundred yards, toss it back out, and repeat the process. Backtrolling is a very effective way of boat control for following depth, weedlines, etc. It is mainly a walleye fishing tactic, but can be used for other species as well, depending on wind conditions.  AND.............backtrolling is mainly a TILLER tactic. Console boats are not that condusive to backtrolling, you are facing forward trying to operate the boat with the steering wheel. If you are sitting at the back with your hand on the tiller handle, you are usually sitting a bit sideways, so you can look back of the boat, at the direction you want to go, and see weedlines, shoals, etc. and make adjustments quickly. If you are operating the boat at the console, you are not as ""in tune"" with boat control as you could be with the tiller. Kinda like backing up a trailer, you have to look back where you are going, and put your hand on the bottom of the steering wheel while launching the trailer, and make the adjustments contrary to what you would if you were facing forward. Tiller handle adjustments are immediate responses when backtrolling. You are not ""pushing"" the boat along a path, you are ""pulling"" it along a path. Way better boat control, even in strong winds.  p.s. I have never been backtrolling in conditions like Trapshooter, kinda don't want to attempt it, lol."
144785,bushart,2007-12-23 16:08:00,2628,"I started out like most with the old 14 foot cartopper and evinrude kicker---then upgraded to the 16 foot lund and 20 horse--found that when the wind howled on the lake we lived on it still was not enough---when I spent the dollars I stayed Tiller for the backtrolling---I went to a 17 foot boat designed for tillers and tournaments and 50 4 stroke and have been happy since.  I predominately have targeted walleyes and smallies but it is useful in most applications except working shorelines tossing for bass or whatever especially in heavier winds.  When the target though is small such as in deeper main lake structures--I can usually stay on them with pretty good accuracy.  I believe you can really spend the cash and get like a 21 ft tiller boat like a ""Warrior"" and motor I'm thinking over 100 horse.  Problem sometimes is having others drive the bigger motors tiller style as opposed to a steering wheel---means your guide most times as your fishin partner is not quite comfortable---they can net for you though.  I believe though that once you get onto it -it is very effective (Probably not for those that want a multi-purpose boat as much but if it is predominately fishing it definetely has its place.

144794,trapshooter,2007-12-23 17:20:00,1234," Good post tjsa.  I've noticed a lot of guys say they shy away from backtrolling when it gets rough.  In order to keep backtrolling in big waves you definitely need some splash guards and preferably a boat with a splash well.  Two working bilges are also a must.  There are sunny days when I have to wear full rain gear from the splash effect.  I put up with this because there is no better way to structure fish walleye.   Point the back of the boat into the wind and kick the engine in and out of reverse as needed.  Sometimes when it's really windy I have to leave the engine in reverse in order to keep moving backwards.  It's a very controlled way to fish though, esp in rough water as it prevents the boat from being blown all over the place and the lines are always going away from the prop.  This has been a good topic though.  I hope some people give it a try if they haven't before."
144796,lew,2007-12-23 17:33:00,12767," Your right Ben, both interesting AND informative.  I've never had occassion to try backtrolling, but have certainly learned plenty from this post."
144558,Gerritt,2007-12-22 14:21:00,6129,I see on alot of sites people talking about back trolling. why would someone want to troll in reverse? any benefits? PIA? what drives a man to drive around in reverse for hours on end?  G
144559,Terry,2007-12-22 14:25:00,14456,the only reason I know is to slow down slow enough to use  a worm harness most motors will not let you troll under 1mph but back trolling can get you down to .2 mph or less
144560,lew,2007-12-22 14:25:00,12767,"I don't do it myself either Gerritt, but I think the idea is that it makes it easier to steer the boat more precisely while going backwards, plus it would also give you the slowest speed possible without an electric motor....at least that's my understanding."
144561,Spiel,2007-12-22 14:25:00,9065,....Ah so young grasshopper and much to learn. Observe the ways of the wise and ye shall become infantly wiser.
144563,FISHINGNUT,2007-12-22 14:27:00,253,Its good when trolling for walleye .You can achieve slower speeds while back trolling plus with a tiller you get better boat control for following weed lines or breaks
144564,Gerritt,2007-12-22 14:30:00,6129,  Bite me oh great one! LOL...  Thanks guys... but why not just use a drift sock or throw down the electric? Seems odd to me.. and I dont recall ever seeing someone doing it on the water...   G
144566,Terry,2007-12-22 14:37:00,14456,"under some conditions like following a weed line under windy conditions you have better boat control for tight turns with back trolling, plus there were no drift socks when people started this method so even though a drift sock would work under many conditions they are use to back trolling and as for electric motors using the gas motor gives you a lot more power and control when needed under windy conditions...."
144569,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-22 14:40:00,957,There are lots of advantages when going after walleyes.  It puts you right over your transducer.  Backtrolling with a youngster in your boat keeps his line away from the prop.  It aids in boat control.  Trolling in reverse might reverse aging.  We'll see.  Don't hit a rock.  Watch out for waves in rough water unless you have a splash board.
144570,FISHINGNUT,2007-12-22 14:44:00,253,From what I have been told there is no better way for boat control when following tight structure than back trolling.My dad and uncle always back troll for eyes and using a  worm harness.I would also think it has something to do with the transducer for your fish finder.Being mounted on the back of the boat you are steering directly under the transducer without the time delay of the length of your boat passing over before reaching the transducer
144572,FISHINGNUT,2007-12-22 14:46:00,253,Tennessee guy beat me I cant type that fast
144574,Beans,2007-12-22 14:47:00,3339,First time I ever witnessed back trolling was on the river below the dam in Trenton...it keeps your bait from drifting past the fish too quickly and in their face longer...neat method once you master it...
144576,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-22 14:56:00,957,Combining backtrolling with a controlled drift  can put walleyes in your boat.  It's more of keeping your bait on the bottom where the fish are than pulling your lure around the lake showing it to lots of fish as in conventional trolling.
144582,oldschool,2007-12-22 15:21:00,38,"All very good answers.  Plus...it keeps the lines away from the propeller. a good thing with the young, inexperienced, and heck, even the unlucky amongst us."
144588,trapshooter,2007-12-22 15:42:00,1234,"These guys all nailed your answer Gerritt.  It's all about boat control.  You can follow a contour or weedline with great precision or easily keep the boat on one spot-on-spot by punching it in and out of reverse.  Of course, you always backtroll into the wind.  This is the only method we use while dragging jigs or bottom bouncers at the lodge I work for.  We use 18' pro V tillers w/ yammy 90's.  Like others mentioned you can slow right down to a crawl if you have to or get a decent trolling speed going.  It's a very versatile and very controled way to fish.  You'll need wave breakers/splash guards and WORKING BILGES cause when it gets rough you will take on water.  Here's a rough day backtrolling on Lac Seul.    I've got a question.... Does anyone backtroll with a console boat?  I've only done it with a tiller.  I'm sure it could be done but it wouldn't be as easy as with the tiller.  Vive le tiller!!"
144592,Spiel,2007-12-22 16:01:00,9065,....Back trolling is one of the top reasons I bought a big tiller!
144594,trapshooter,2007-12-22 16:14:00,1234," Ah, you truly are a wise old master!  Seriously though, I couldn't agree more.  Tiller and backtrolling for life!"
144601,Garyv,2007-12-22 17:29:00,547,"And remember once you start backtrolling, you will need backtrolling accessories.  Does the spending ever end? http://www.wavewackers.com/"
144608,trapshooter,2007-12-22 18:14:00,1234,at least they're cheaper then a trolling motor.....
144609,walleyejigger,2007-12-22 18:15:00,876,"i spend 80% of my time fishing back trolling, but even that isn't slow enough for me sometimes, i mix it up with a lot of neutral"
144616,Roy,2007-12-22 18:38:00,13728,TILLER!   What a wonderful world!
144654,Rizzo,2007-12-22 21:45:00,4754,I backtroll for muskies at 6 mph just so I can look like an idiot...a very wet idiot
144661,John Bacon,2007-12-22 22:28:00,3277,The increased control is especially true when trolling into a strong wind.  If you try trolling into the wind at a slow speed the wind will tend to push the bow around.  Back trolling with the wind doesn't work so well; I only tried that once.
144757,camillj,2007-12-23 14:18:00,1988,Yep .. backtrolling rocks for me ... but then most of my time is spent in a tinny with a 9.9 tiller .... and no electric ... I think if I had a bass boat and a foot operated electric I wouldnt backtroll too much ... but for now ... its my way of covering water AND being able to jig/cast/bottom bounce AND see whats coming toward the prop at a manageable speed ... and it really does put more fish in the boat (for me at least)  Like Big Cliff said though ... backing trolling into the wind isnt a very good idea ... BUT thats when I toss the anchor out the front and 'back-drift' with the waves for power .... theres always an answer
144773,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-23 15:20:00,957,Backtrolling is less like trolling and more like taking your jig for a walk on the bottom.  You're jigging almost straight down from your rod tip and you're jigging the area that you're seeing on your sonar screen.  It's vertical jigging at it's best.  I wouldn't suggest pulling a minnow lure backwards.
144775,fishindevil,2007-12-23 15:31:00,6254,"Well i know back trolling can work well in certain conditions but i just put a trolling plate on my motor,so i wouldnt have to do that,you can use your electric trolling motor as well,or you can toss out a drift bag and troll like that...so there is always options,before i would be back trolling for sure,and i have tried it before and didnt find that i had any advantage over any other way of trolling !!!"
