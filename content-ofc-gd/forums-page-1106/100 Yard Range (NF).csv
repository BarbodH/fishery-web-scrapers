144691,fishinfool,2007-12-23 02:11:00,366,I didn't get a chance to get out Deer Hunting this year and I would really like to get out with my 30-06 and see if it still shoots straight. Does anyone know where there is a 100 yard range in the general area of Pickering that I can go to? I used to go to Cold Creek up near Nobleton but that has been shut down for quite some time now. Any help from all the shooters on this site would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks
