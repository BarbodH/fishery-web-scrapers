(couple from U.S.A.)  I told them that there was a crew that drained the lakes the first Thursday of the month, and repainted the bottom for that colour.  I found out later that this couple took this to heart and extended their holiday a week just to witness this.  Well needless to say, it didn't happen.  I was given a lot of bass from my boss as I told this to them at work.  I got in more trouble because he had to listen to their complaint without laughing and calling them sunfish for believing the story.  -Why do you keep all the reindeer locked up?  Meaning the elk that love to hang out in the park that has a fence on one side.  -Are those mountains real?  See story above same answer.  -What do the collars on the animals in the park mean?  They are the friendly ones that you can pet.  -On a trip in Mexico we asked where a phone was to call back home in Canada.  A U.S. visitor overheard and asked ""You have phones in canada?""  My reply was ""Yes, one for every 10 igloos""  Yes it's true, the only dumb question is the one not asked, but seriously folks?"
