686207,robinwood,2012-04-13 15:36:00,28,Lost these photos in the computer until now - even though I understand Chandos has no fish -there are a few and the water is really nice and clear pics  Lots of little fish under water 1 little fish on big lure 1 ok pike (caught a couple ) 1 big bass went under dock - released lure and had to snorkle under dock to free the lure - it jumped so there were witnesses  Robinwood
