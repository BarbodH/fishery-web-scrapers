Got headache, stomach ache and legs hurt, I no come work.'  The boss says, 'You know something, Hung Chow, I really need you today. When I feel sick like you do, I go to my wife and tell her to give me sex. That makes everything better and I go to work.. You try that.'  Two hours later Hung Chow calls again. 'I do what you say and I feel great. I be at work soon.........You got nice house'"
