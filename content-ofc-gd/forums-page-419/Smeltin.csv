686101,bigugli,2012-04-13 01:27:00,6138,"Finally got out for some smelt.  It really stunk not beeing able to jig the smelt on ice this year. I more than made up for it last night. . We averaged 20-50 smelt with each dip of the net. Not huge numbers, but enough to fill the big roast pan twice.  I just finished cleaning them all. Now to clean up the disaster in the kitchen."
686102,Rod Caster,2012-04-13 01:35:00,5784,"Sweet! I always enjoy smelting. Its more of a tradition for me than some other ""traditional"" occasions.  Enjoy the feed and the mess"
686109,knightfisher,2012-04-13 01:50:00,237,Was a productive night for sure. We all went home with a good number. Fried up a batch while cleaning them today. We're going out again this weekend Bruce if you want to join us again.      
686110,NAW,2012-04-13 01:52:00,4022,Nice little haul Bruce!  That'll keep the pup well fed for a few days!
686113,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-13 01:56:00,310,Mmm smelts. Nice haul right there.
686118,Fish Farmer,2012-04-13 02:11:00,2234,"Bruce, I'm frying your picture tomorrow  . Thats the closest I got to smelt. I went to the Hamilton canal last night and NADA 10 guys dipping and not one Smelt."
686121,bigugli,2012-04-13 02:20:00,6138,"Yep, smelt was on the menu here as well. Casey had his feed, and a few left over for a snack tomorrow. That might just be a plan."
686184,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-13 12:46:00,2582,"I'm so jealous.  I too missed my winter excursion down your way for smelts, so I'm itching for a feed. And to top it off I came home last night empty handed.  I'm just happy your post had no fried up smelt on a plate...that would have put me on spin cycle  Enjoy your bounty and thx for sharing"
686185,Lip-ripper,2012-04-13 12:58:00,228,    ...I know... I'm a bit of a prick....
686189,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-13 13:11:00,2582,LOL...thx for the grin
686192,Fish Farmer,2012-04-13 13:33:00,2234,"Now you did it. ""Man"" they look more than good. Nice guy, I suppose you ate them all your self, didn't save us any."
686199,Rod Caster,2012-04-13 15:00:00,5784,"Hey Bruce, what are those smaller minnows amonst the smelt? Babies or shiners?"
686215,bigugli,2012-04-13 17:00:00,6138,The smelt and shiners are running together at the moment. many of the smelt I cleaned had fresh  shiner down the throat.
686255,Beans,2012-04-13 21:25:00,3339, Hey Steve...Valu-Mart has them on sale this week...$3.49 for a 1 lb bag...   
686277,Hooked,2012-04-13 22:56:00,891,man that is a nice haul indeed.  Good for you guys.
686453,beginner,2012-04-14 20:45:00,542,"nice smelties guys, my friend and I went last night too... we got their by 11pm and finish 330am, It was slow compare last yr... but anyway here is the pic.. cleaning em and putting it in the ziplock for fry this summer....  "
686664,Billy Bob,2012-04-15 18:11:00,5865,Do you guys have a limit on your side of the river.....we are limited to only 8 qts of smelt.  Bob
686762,MJL,2012-04-15 22:01:00,2427,I'm getting a serious case of the munchies right now! I've only eaten smelt once but they were delicious...I'll definitely have to get in on some of that action one day
686778,beginner,2012-04-15 22:52:00,542,"I dont think we do, I bring home half a bucket... they sure are tasty.. my wife fried it with salt, pepper, eggs and flour... then deep fry it...."
686876,bigugli,2012-04-16 03:40:00,6138,No limit in Ontario.  Although I am old enough to remember the days of the $1.00 smelting license way back when CO's would actually come out and measure everyone's nets.
