Last year when they were there, they went for a drive and found an area where spawning fish could be seen if you were at the right time of year. They were told there is another spot not far away for the same. I know nothing of the area so my question is can you tell me the spawning look outs so I can make them up some directions from there cottage and also they are arriving on mothers day will this be too late to see any amount of fish? Thanks for all your help."
