686227,Pikeslayer8,2012-04-13 18:29:00,336,"MB, your kids are spectacular.      Walleye aint bad either.  Man, do you ever have the life."
686236,manitoubass2,2012-04-13 19:47:00,11391," Many thanks PS8! We truly, truly appreciate it.  My kids say thumbs up at Mother Natures dinner table!!!         "
685846,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 01:53:00,11391,"Well, this time me and my daughter headed down to the river for a shore fish. The conditions changes drastically since yesterday. The sun was out, zero wind, the water levels dropped about 14"" and the water was as clear as I've ever seen it. Basically, it didn't look very promising...  We rigged up a few shakey heads like yesterday, and see if the fish would smash it yet again.  When we arrived, one boat was near bye. We asked them how there luck was? No fish he said, guess they were live bait fishing on jigs. They went on trolling away, and I casted. Cast one, nothing.  Cast two, BAAAAMMMM!, oh yeah, grab the net!!!! Another good smack of the shakey head worm. Fought the fish for a few minutes, then my daughter calmly netted the fish head first. High fives!!! and picture time, a true Rainy River beast!!!    Cast about 3 more times, same thing! Just simply shaking that jig off bottom in the current seams. Man these fish are absolutely hammering this bait! This one is CHUNKYYYY! Again, my daughter does a great net job!    Again, all it takes is another cast.... I'll never get sick of this I'm thinking, lol. Into the net she goes...          One more cast, another one. A little smaller, but still a great fish! Man were getting spoiled when 23"" walleye are small, lol      Now we switched it up to see if the Livetarget Golden shiner would work. About five casts after jigging this guy off bottom, BAAAAMMMM! Yet again, so much fun!        goofing around....    Look at the teeth on this momma!!!    Another beautiful day with my daughter! This is really something to remember these past two days!  Thank you Uncle! These fish are for you!!!!!!"
685848,Roy,2012-04-12 02:00:00,13728,"Wow, another fantastic outing! Thanks for sharing."
685849,Joeytier,2012-04-12 02:01:00,3990,Beautiful fish.  Isn't it awesome when a new pattern comes together?
685851,danc,2012-04-12 02:10:00,4677,"It doesn't get much better than that. Fantastic. There's a couple of guys on my job site in Dryden that spent last weekend there with similar results. They also boated a 54"" Sturgeon. What an amazing fishery you have there. Great post."
685852,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 02:10:00,11391," Thank you, and yes!  Anyone else ever heard of shakey heading walleye???? I haven't, but I'm simply amazed how well it works (at least right now).  I've just recently enjoyed bass style spinnerbaits for walleye, and that works very well and is a ton of  fun, but this shakey head worm combo is kinda ridiculous...   "
685853,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 02:12:00,11391," Cool, I've seen some boats that aren't local. Good for them for coming to enjoy the fishery!  If you ever plan to come this way, let me know! Always nice to meet a board member and get some fishing in   "
685856,danc,2012-04-12 02:16:00,4677, Thanks. Offer extended from here as well.
685857,Gregoire,2012-04-12 02:19:00,1397,Wow...I'm seriously jealous.
685860,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 02:36:00,11391," Very kind of you. I'll be up there to pre fish for Dryden Walleye Masters. If we can't get together to fish we should certainly grab a beer, or some food.    lol, I'm still kinda in shock myself   "
685869,Live2fish85,2012-04-12 03:23:00,1633,Awesome man. Those are some nice fish. Can't complain fishing and spending the time with the daughter.
685870,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 03:50:00,11391," Fishing with my daughter is always a treat, your absolutely right!  I fish with my kids alot, but sometimes I don't post the pics of them. In honor of one of my greatest net men/companions, here is a few of my kids for you all to enjoy!!!!! The prides of my life, they make me so happy, and so proud!!!!  My oldest son Braydon        My son John, who is affectionately know to family as ""Jigger""    My oldest and youngest with a bass    Jigs bass    My youngest boys bass    My oldest girl, still afraid to grab the fish, lol    I got millions of these pictures.

685910,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 13:14:00,11391,"Thanks alot guys, glad you enjoyed the report/pictures!  Yesterday was just one of them days. Everything was saying it shouldn't be that good of a day. Water temps dropped back down to 40 degrees, water levels dropped a good 14"", water clarity was insanely clear for a large river, it was perfectly sunny and the was no wind????  But I'll take it, hahaha.  I got two more kicks at the can, shore fishing this evening and out in the boat tomorrow with my old man.  Hopefully the next report will be half as good"

685977,limeyangler,2012-04-12 19:41:00,5204,looks kinda boring to me
686005,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 21:12:00,11391, sooooo boring! It really sucked being woken up every 3 minutes by another hyyyyugge walleye.  can't even get a quality rest down there anymore  
686007,Christopheraaron,2012-04-12 21:15:00,3525,"That 6th one kind of looked like a snook, hmm.. By the way if your going to be in ofc 2012 ask for team four!"
686064,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 23:50:00,11391," I'm trying to get back into the tourny, lol.  Maybe send in a REQUEST???     "
