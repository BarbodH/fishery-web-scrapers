686768,Joeytier,2012-04-15 22:11:00,3990,"I'm sure people would more than willing to share that information with you where thousands of eyes are watching...  You obviously don't live far, go find out yourself."

If no one wants to post if anything even lives there then send me a PM."
686774,Joeytier,2012-04-15 22:25:00,3990,"It's well known spot for migratory birds and turtles, so it's obviously a relatively healthy ecosystem.  I'm sure it has some panfish.  Go try it."

He's 14 years old which tells me he's learning the sport as well as how to approach others for advice.  His long term goal is to guide! Meaning I too have wondered about him and some of his questions, now I know why.  Couple of times I was gonna jump on him as well, but now I think a little leeway is in order.  Let's try to promote and assist him a bit here.  I can't help you with this particular location RHF, but you got the right idea asking to be pm'd with any details.  Generally, etiquette dictates NOT giving specific details or locations on open posts, which extends to asking for them as well.  This is to protect the resource from being pressured even more than it is already - and I'll leave that one right there!  Good luck on your goal!  Michael"

Come on dood.....you can do better than that!     Why....in MY day....blah blah blah 2 hour walk...blah blah blah...uphill both ways.....blah blah blah...coupla measly sunfish  "
687044,Christopheraaron,2012-04-16 17:26:00,3525,I'll bike an hour or 2 but it's still a day's trip and I want to know where I'm going before I try.
