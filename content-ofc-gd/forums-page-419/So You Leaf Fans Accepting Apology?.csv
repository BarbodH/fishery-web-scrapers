686016,12footspringbok,2012-04-12 21:59:00,459, I'm almost glad i don't have to stay up watching nail biters this playoff season.  One thing I know for sure is that there won't be 7 years in a row with no playoffs....
686031,bushart,2012-04-12 22:44:00,2628,I should spark up my resume  I'm positive I could'nt do any worse
686059,SirCranksalot,2012-04-12 23:42:00,3291,"  Here's a bit of 'poetry' that my bro just sent me:   Fanned on It  Doesn’t seem like the playoffs, if the Canadiens are not there  Habs’  fans said, as they slumped in their chairs  Leafs’ fans, they  know how  to go to plan B  But cheering for someone else is not hockey to me  A lot of Canadians will cheer for the Canucks  But seeing them with the Cup, that would really suck  Those other teams, from the original six  The way they beat Montreal, just made me sick  I’ll just switch channels and watch golf instead  Or maybe call it quits and  just go to bed  It’s better to wait for the crap they play in the fall  At least there’s a chance, for an occasional win by Montreal  There's no point in trying logic or reason  The Habs just need a French coach and a bit of luck next season  "
686080,Beans,2012-04-13 00:14:00,3339," My sentiments eggzactly Roy...How things have changed...can you imagine Harold Ballard ""apologizing ???"
686168,uglyfish,2012-04-13 12:07:00,981,"Burke isn't on the ice, nor was he to fault when the team fell apart. They have some really great pieces, and one of the best farm systems going rite now, they are developing talent. A healthy reimer and another scoring forward with a little veteran leadership, and  this team is a playoff team."
686187,Headhunter,2012-04-13 13:06:00,5703,"I think Rex hit the nail o the head in last nights comments... Copied and pasted for you enjoyment...  What do you call a hockey team that issues apologies? IKEA.  And where does that happen? Why in Toronto of course, centre-ice for the ‘losing-est’ franchise since the invention of the puck.  It’s said that Don Cherry sheds tears on his high-collared neck every time he walks past the Air Canada Centre when the Leafs are playing. We all know what he’s feeling.  How long has it been since the Maple Leafs won a Stanley Cup? Or even made the playoffs?  It’s been so long the time-scale is geologic: glaciers have melted, the earth’s plates have shifted, dinosaurs (Harold Ballard) have vanished, since any Toronto newspaper could front-page a Leaf victory.  I’ve checked on Wikipedia. The earth was young when the Leafs had men on the team, understood that the purpose of the other team’s net was to shoot pucks into it, when the thought of losing to some American team with Ducks in its name was an unspeakable impossibility.  Think. History buffs may remember these names, from the days before The Fall: Mahovlich, Keon, Armstrong, Horton, Bower. They were the kind of players that made up a team that earned them a word not heard so much in Toronto today: winners.  Winners. The last time that word bruised the lips of anyone around the Air Canada Centre, he was arrested on the double charge of reckless falsehood and criminal optimism.  Aware that Toronto Hockey has equal suspense and less esteem than the city’s annual Duck Regatta, the club’s owners - just back from the piling up the bullion in the counting house - this week decided that after yet another year of empty dreams, flattened hope, crushed expectations and broken hearts they should apologize to the team’s despairing fans (it’s not known if they sent flowers).  They are buying full-page ads of apology. Is this a hockey team, or a band of overpaid flagellants? Did The Rocket apologize? Howe? Hull? Lafleur? Orr? Lemieux? Of course they didn’t. They could play hockey. They were too busy winning.  45 years out of the finals - longer than it took the trees to grow, that supplied them the wood, to make the hockey sticks, they don’t score with. Whole forests have been felled for no real reason.  You apologize after 2 or 3 losses, or even 5 or 6. You do not apologize for a 45-year losing streak. You go into exile, or take up ping-pong, or selling vacuum cleaners. In other words you leave the scene of the country’s worst sport’s crime.  Playing in the country’s biggest city, filling the arena for every losing game and losing season - you don’t need to apologize - you’ve lost the right to apologize. “Sorry” is not something you get to say. “Sorry” is something you’ve become.  For The National, I’m Rex Murphy.  And for OFC...  HH"
686188,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-13 13:09:00,0,oof... scathing criticism by rm.
686200,BassMan11,2012-04-13 15:00:00,583,I'd say thats a little harsh. Especially from someone who has never played the game before.
686206,jimmer,2012-04-13 15:29:00,2730,"The one positive about the Leafs not making the playoffs, is that the games don't cut into my fishing time. As for the apology, I see it more as an admittance to failure. Any apology is somewhat hollow at this point, unless they fire the GM and his overpaid cronies."
685748,muskymatt,2012-04-11 20:56:00,2608,"  Something the laffs will never experience!  Hockey circles are saying the Sens(PRAISE ALFIE) have a very good chance of upsetting the Rangers!  With their head to head record, they just might!  But you'll miss it when watching golf"
685750,muskymatt,2012-04-11 20:57:00,2608," Yup, until we had that ""pimple on the azz"" removed!"
685751,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 20:58:00,0,  habs fan actually... not that i'm proud to admit that.
685752,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 21:00:00,0," i am the one who started the ""hockey music"" thread... now leaf fans didn't start it, but they sure did use it to kick and scream about the sens...  it's a sad and bitter time in leaf nation."
685753,bushart,2012-04-11 21:01:00,2628,Reality is Burke inherited that Duck's team from Murray  But this was'nt about a leaf-Sens thing  Years and Tears tells me---The Leafs need a better defence
685755,jedimaster,2012-04-11 21:01:00,3472,  Is that the circular lovin with the 5 seniorita fans in Kanata?
685757,[email protected],2012-04-11 21:03:00,119," true, cause we beat you in four......  really, beat the Rangers????? not with backslide you've had recently...."
685758,[email protected],2012-04-11 21:06:00,119," I agree with your whole statement.  btw - check out where/who this thread turned into Leafs vs sens, twas not a Leaf fan."
685759,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 21:08:00,0," truth be told, you're probably right.  it's an uphill battle for the sens but should they pull off the upset it would be advised you not show your face around here for 6 months.  there will be no mercy for you OR your horrible hockey team."
685760,[email protected],2012-04-11 21:14:00,119,"lol, pretty sure I'm safe. it would be the same old tired lines from the three nottawa fans anyway..... one round does not win you the cup, so if that's your definition of success, have at er"
685762,fish_fishburn,2012-04-11 21:21:00,1311,The Leafs went down because all the other teams gelled and stepped on the gas for the last 30 games. The Leafs were already WOT and couldn't respond. Just saying.
685763,davey buoy,2012-04-11 21:23:00,5505," Exactly,the team needs BIG help.Rebuilding?"
685764,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 21:25:00,0," so if you don't think a first round victory over the top seed team is ""success"", what would you deem a team that hasn't made the playoffs since the lockout?"
685767,Whitespinnerbait,2012-04-11 21:33:00,2038,"Like, just how much TALK can there be about the Toronto Maple Leafs  :dunno:"
685771,Joeytier,2012-04-11 21:42:00,3990,"Hey, some of us are habs fans...Things could be worse"
685772,jedimaster,2012-04-11 21:42:00,3472," I don't think any leafs fan is happy with the way things have gone. The leafs have been horrible, and so has the burke rebuild. We don't settle for mediocre like sens fans. Calling for a parade because they squeeked into the playoffs in 8th spot. Success is a cup and nothing short. Progress can be made along the way. But I guess if your team has neve won a cup you need to take any amount of progress and call it success."
685979,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-12 19:43:00,0,"considering that it was only last winter that we started the rebuild, and half our squad was in the AHL last year, i'm pretty content with squeaking into the playoffs. the future is bright."
685984,davey buoy,2012-04-12 19:54:00,5505,"A few of you guys mentioned why Ottawa is brought into this thread. I don't know why,but can we stay with the leafs for this Question ?Ottawa is a whole different thread on it's own. Let's give the leafs a good perspective of how we feel!.As I've said previously,Burke is done IMO. Let's stick to the program on this one:wallbash:"
685987,jedimaster,2012-04-12 20:09:00,3472, What are the Sens rebuilding from 1992? Thats what? 20 years of no result.
685995,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-12 20:31:00,310,What are the Leafs rebuilding from 1967? That's what? 45 years of no result?
685996,jedimaster,2012-04-12 20:33:00,3472,Leafs are rebuilding from there last cup win... the sens are rebuilding from? oh wait nothing. Same as what they will do this year.
685997,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-12 20:33:00,0,hahaha.  you're so bitter and jaded.  comes with cheering for perennial loser i guess.
685999,davey buoy,2012-04-12 20:39:00,5505," This bashing will go forever,can we all just get along and stick to the topic?lol."
686010,uglyfish,2012-04-12 21:32:00,981,"Well, if being GM of the biggest market in hockey is so easy, why not forward ur resumes to MLSE?  We'll surely see a winner on the ice in a year with someone here running the ship! Lol"
686012,davey buoy,2012-04-12 21:41:00,5505," Apparently Burke had more resources than we were led to believe(money for players if he asked).And how long would you say it should take to make a first round playoff team?.You don't think a man with his so called Knowledge couldn't even make the playoffs,and if I may add"" worse"" now than they were when he took over 4 years ago.See ya Brian,don't let the door kick you in the:asshat:on your way out."
685604,bushart,2012-04-11 11:54:00,2628,Or is it just a PR move till next year??  I'm not in the habit of helping the Leafs---but with their record---it's not even fun to pick on em anymore.  Ever wonder why some teams (and I've seen the Sens do it)---take average goalies and make em look great  DEFENCE!!!  There is adequate goal scoring (possibly short one more vet sniper)---but they need defence that is not just meat on skates---and Burke says yet again---We need to get bigger----They need to get smarter ---defensively in their own end  Even Sheldon Souray was a steal for nothing this season-----veteran presence  Phaneuf is not enough
685605,Roy,2012-04-11 11:58:00,13728,*yawn*
685611,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-11 12:15:00,310,"I hate the Leafs and I just love the state that they're in right now. Brian Burke is a joke and has no clue as to how one is supposed to build a team. Hey Brian, it's up the middle man!!! You ain't going nowhere with wingers as your star players. Look at Jerome Iginla in Calgary, Rick Nash in Columbus,... Without a #1 centre, they're going nowhere fast. The Phil Kessel trade was a TERRIBLE move. Brian Burke inherited a rubix cube when he arrived in Toronto and now he has created one of his own."
685613,bigugli,2012-04-11 12:22:00,6138,"The ship is sinking, and everybody else is to blame but Burke.  What a joke. Must be prepping himself for a career in politics."
685615,bushart,2012-04-11 12:30:00,2628,It's just I seen his sour look all over the tv this morn
685644,Lip-ripper,2012-04-11 13:40:00,228,Just got this in an email... figured I'd share. Sharing is caring after all...  PARTING SHOTS FOR THIS SEASON !!!                                                                              
685650,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-11 14:16:00,2690,"If they really want to make a sincere apology, a reimbursement for all season ticket holders would be a good place to start!!!"
685671,jedimaster,2012-04-11 14:46:00,3472,"Thats not going to happen. Besides what would that do to improve things? The only appology I need to hear is Schnieder in Blue and White in the fall, along with drafting one of the two top center prospects, and picking up a centerman in the off season. I don't know who though. The UFA list for center's is weak this year. And we know burke won't pick up any offer sheet rfa's... Eitherway, its glaringly obvious what the leafs need."
685675,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-11 15:07:00,2690,  Obviously not...it was meant more as a joke...sort of like the entire month of February for the Leafs
685682,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-11 15:48:00,10439, You missed one key person needed in TO and that is a very qualified sports psychologist!!! If they had one on staff this year they may have been able to stop the free fall that happened after the all star break. We know that the team had skills as they showed it in the first half of the season but then they lost their confidence and had a meltdown. The reason they tanked was all in their heads!!! But that's just my opinion.
685686,jedimaster,2012-04-11 15:59:00,3472,Good point.

685708,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 18:21:00,0,"pretty weak ""apology"" from burke.  his answer to the ""pittsburgh model"" question pretty much showed he takes no responsibility for the team not succeeding considering that the #1 critique of burke was building through free agency instead of the draft.  he attributes pittsburgh's success to getting crosby, which as the last year has shown, they don't need him to succeed.  what an arrogant   that guy is."
685720,Headhunter,2012-04-11 19:29:00,5703,"  You know Doc, as a life long Leaf fan, I have seen a long line of GM's toddle their way through the hallowed halls of Maple Leaf Gardens and on into the ACC. Each had their goals, their ""style"" and each, at least in my life time, has failed. (I was a 6 when they last won the cup) I'd be the richest guy in Hog Town, if I could find a real reason as to the continued rate of failure... I presume that the answer lies in a number of reasons vs one. I the mean time, this Leaf fan hasn't yet decided who to cheer for this spring... May be Go Jay's Go!!! LOL  HH"
685722,jedimaster,2012-04-11 19:38:00,3472,Have the GM's for the Senators ever appologized to there fans for never winning a cup? umm wait sorry that was a trick question... I meant fan not fans.
685730,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 20:10:00,0,"if everybody won cups it wouldn't be such a big deal to win one.  as a fan, all you can do is ask that your team ices a team that is competitive more years than not... hence why burke is a joke.  does anybody else find the notion of a leafs fan chirping me about not winning a cup since '92 comical at best??   no wonder nothing changes in leaf land.  obsessed with OTHER teams instead of focusing on the mess that has become of their own team."
685733,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 20:24:00,0,no apology necessary.  brian murray has done an excthhhheptional job.
685735,davey buoy,2012-04-11 20:32:00,5505,"Not me,Burke has had some opportunity to do something and chose not to .I don't think another year(5 total) will change that .Having said he made the playoffs 7 straight years before being a leaf ,well that was then and this is now. IMO he needs to go now not later."
685737,muskymatt,2012-04-11 20:39:00,2608," Leave it to a laff fan to make fun of someones physical appearance and speech!  Then again, watching the Laffs play can cause brain damage, after all, they still cheer for them.  I thought all the laff fans would be gone by now, now that their messiah has been eliminated...again!!"
