686644,BillM,2012-04-15 16:27:00,17367,"Almost as good as the double twist 720 the Coyote goalie pulled lastnight, lol!"
686645,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-15 16:30:00,10439,  It did look like he was hit in the mellon by a snipers shot didn't it?
686646,BillM,2012-04-15 16:35:00,17367,All that rolling around holding his face lead to............nothing.   Should have gotten 2 for delay of game.
686648,kickingfrog,2012-04-15 16:42:00,8333,"Smith must have played soccer as a kid. No doubt he was hit, and there should have been a penalty, but the embellishment was ridiculous and embarrassing."
686649,SirCranksalot,2012-04-15 16:42:00,3291,"Well, at least they offered some sort of excuse. The Leafs offer no excuses for falling all over themselves!"
686653,kickingfrog,2012-04-15 16:47:00,8333,Swing.... and a miss.
686657,Rod Caster,2012-04-15 17:10:00,5784," Dam mit I missed all that... Too tired to stay up. I was around for the last three seconds o the third. Just enough to go to bed angry. Smith looked pissed after that goal too. Was the ""head"" shot before or after the end of the third?"
686661,kickingfrog,2012-04-15 17:48:00,8333,Middle of the 2nd? I went to bed after the 2nd period.
686773,rufus,2012-04-15 22:24:00,267,It was just like watchin' ole Billy Smith writhing around on the ice! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Smith_(ice_hockey)
