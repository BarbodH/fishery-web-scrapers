685991,NAW,2012-04-12 20:27:00,4022,"I picked up a big spool of 8lbs green at Rack and Reel.  Ande's line shut down right?  If I see any, I'll grab some.  Great line eh!"
685992,misfish,2012-04-12 20:28:00,29133,"Like I said Nick,not eons old. Lou,s had that stuff since I can remember before the new owner..  And yes it a great line.It was my main go to back when.Would be nice to have some again."
685994,FrankTheRabbit,2012-04-12 20:30:00,479,www.fishheadscanada.net has Ande available. Hope that helps.
685998,Court R,2012-04-12 20:37:00,213,"Call Peter's Tackle in St Catharies, I think they have some."
686017,12footspringbok,2012-04-12 22:02:00,459,There used to be a couple places around here to get it now there is none...  I know its not the answer you're looking for but I just order mine from Cabelas.
686018,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-12 22:02:00,10439,Bass Pro carries Ande as well. LeBarons used to but I don't know if they carry it any more.
686022,davey buoy,2012-04-12 22:17:00,5505,"What makes that line great?,Always open to new /better products."
686024,misfish,2012-04-12 22:21:00,29133,"Thanks all  FTR site has it.  I,ll be driving through St.Cath soon,will try and make a stop.  Dave, the BPS here dosent."
686025,misfish,2012-04-12 22:24:00,29133," It,s prefrence/comfort, in the line to me. Call me old school.LOL"
686033,Roe Bag,2012-04-12 22:52:00,246,Centerpin Angling has it in green. Shipping is reasonable. A whole lot cheaper than running around looking for it.  http://www.centerpinangling.com/main-line.html   Shipping is $8.95 for one spool or two. Order two and for about $30 you can have them sent to your door.
686079,nino,2012-04-13 00:11:00,11,"I've been using 8lb Ande line for years.  Never let me down.  Bought a bulk spool of blue Ande line, 3000yards loong time ago and its still good.  Spool my spinning reels with it for steelhead, bass and everything else.  Also use it on my centre pins!!  Definitely old school!"
686082,BillM,2012-04-13 00:16:00,17367,My oldman used nothing but Ande and Trilene Big Game back in the day.  I think we've still got one of those 3000yrd spools of Big Game downstairs..  Actually used it last August..  No issues at all.
686107,NAW,2012-04-13 01:49:00,4022," I've always found it to have very low memory, and low stretch.  like Brian said, I guess it's a confidence thing?  I use Braid on almost all my rods now.  But when I'm not using braid, I use Andes.  It's also my go to leader material if I don't have 100% flouro on hand.  Oh, and a correction Brian, It's a spool of 6lb green I have, not 8lb.   Edit.  I just re-red my post and thought of something...  ""I don't always use Mono.  But when I do.  I prefer Andes""  Yes...I've had a few beers."
686157,misfish,2012-04-13 09:32:00,29133,Thanks again for the leads guys.  
686172,Harrison,2012-04-13 12:20:00,2202, Get with the times would ya Brian... sheesh.. lol...
686564,RSF,2012-04-15 03:44:00,47,"Cripes, I used Ande line back in the 80s. It's still on my Penn and I don't recall it ever breaking (30ld). Make shift anchor rope--lol."
686578,Canuck2fan,2012-04-15 04:53:00,1444,I have used Ande but really prefer Raven Mainline now. Less Stretch less memory problems than I had with Ande and the green is more visible.  That said the last time I was Angler Outfitter he had both and so did the Fishing Store in Stratford.
