683946,NAW,2012-04-05 16:22:00,4022,"Bill Hamblin was a co-writer of the ""Musky Hunters Alminac"".  He was also a teacher at my highschool for a period of time.  I've always wondered if he was a member of this board.  He was also a guide on Georgian Bay.  Wondering if he still guides.  I'd love to get out with him.  Now that I've moved closer, G-bay is my new playground  Does anyone know Bill?, and what he's up to these days?"

We had a death in the family.  I don't know if you remember a character named Zane..  He and I talk about you every now and then.  I do a fishing weekend every year with a few guys from F.E. Madill.  Maybe this year we can head out with you for a charter?"
