We planned on being out earlier but had some set backs and were out on the water by  10:45am. As soon as we were out of the marina we had the lines in the water. We had been out maybe 5-10 mins and my rod gets hammered after an awesome fight I got it in and weighted, measured, quick pics and back it went to swim another day, that brown was my new personal best at 10.2 lbs.  Not a tank but a decent brown.    Well after that the lines went back out and with in 5 minutes again we had another one on. This was my friends first time trolling Lake Ontario and his first trout. It wasn't a big one but still a nice fish and a trout.      Well lines in again and with in a half hour my friend got another one on. A nice 7.2 lbs brown and making his personal best.      Stayed out for another hour and got nothing all in all was a great day out and can't wait until next week.  Thanks."
