I recorded the length/girth, the tag number, and released it. The phone number on the tag was worn off, so I don't have the number to call.  I've emailed a few places now, and nobody seems to want to get back to me, so I'm hoping someone here knows that number, so I can call.  I'd love to know when this fish was tagged, and how much its grown in that time. This lake is not stocked, and it has the natural strain of algonquin lakers in it.  Any ideas?  Here's a pic of the fish. You can just see the tag by the dorsal fin. It was covered in green slime/algae, and very hard to read the numbers. The fish is still out there, tag and all.    S."

686528,Sinker,2012-04-15 02:29:00,8692,I've sent one to the general email already. I guess I'll just wait it out and see.  S.
686531,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-15 02:37:00,0,it's better to call.  you could wait weeks before someone responds to something like that.  hahaha
686533,Sinker,2012-04-15 02:42:00,8692,"Ya, I tried that and got put on hold for longer than I could wait.  S."
