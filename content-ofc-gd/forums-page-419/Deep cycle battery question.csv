686272,Hooked,2012-04-13 22:50:00,891,"Hi there, I have a deep cycle battery I was charging the other day.  I have my charger set to 15A charge.  The thing is the meter would go up to around 10amps, stay there for a minute then go to 0.  This repeated itself over and over again.  I left it and returned later to find that it was complete. I put my multi-meter on it and read 13.01 Amps.  Is this a regular output on a charged batter?  Kinda thinking it might be toast with the fluctuation issue I witnessed while charing.  This batter did give me some issues charging last summer too.  It's not even 2 years old and has not been used all that much.  Any input would be appreciated."
686274,Dutch,2012-04-13 22:53:00,831,"The needle jumping around means the battery is fully charged, I think.  That's what happens with some other chargers I have seen.  13 amp reading on a fully charged battery is normal.  If in doubt, take to a battery shop for a load test."
686276,Hooked,2012-04-13 22:55:00,891," Thanks Dutch, I think I'll take it in for that test.  It most definitely shouldn't of been fully charged, was sitting there for 3 months."
686288,Woodsman,2012-04-13 23:31:00,1286,I take it you actually mean it was reading 13 volts after charging with the charger disconnected. A little on the low side. Leave the battery for a couple days & then check out what voltage it's at. If it's dropped from 13 volts to any major degree then it is not holding a charge. Battery is gone. BTW: Deep cycle batteries are better being charged by a lower amp charger (ie: 2 amps) over a longer period of time.
686289,ecmilley,2012-04-13 23:31:00,2163,"it' volts your are checking 13 is fine for a deep cycle, before you take it in have you checked the water levels? very important if you have exposed plates and charged it may as well get a new one and if it's been sitting that long it may be ok but i suggest charging at 2 amps initially for several hours before bumping up the charging rate the bouncing needle on the charger is usually an indicater of a battery plate shorting out or verty low state of charge"
686310,Hooked,2012-04-14 00:33:00,891,Thanks for the info guys.
686326,NANUK,2012-04-14 01:35:00,797,"Sounds like the battery is fully charged but you can always double check Let the battery sit for a few hours without the charger to remove any surface charge. Check with a good DC volt meter and/or with a Hydrometer (Always wear face protection and away from any combustibles.  This is for Deep cycle batteries. VOLT METER...........CHARGE....................HYDROMETER 12.65v ..................100%  ....................1.265 12.45v .................. 75%  ....................1.225 12.24v .................. 50%  ....................1.190 12.06v .................. 25%  ....................1.155 11.89V .................Discharged.................1.120  Make sure the water level is above the plates, preferably about 1/4"" below the neck of fill hole. You can also take it to a battery shop for a load test as mentioned above, most will test it for free ."
686388,Tybo,2012-04-14 15:32:00,1373,When using a hydrometer you should rinse it out after every cell check.This way gives you the most stable readings.
686552,RSF,2012-04-15 03:33:00,47,"Hi all, Here's another simple method to determine the charge of a 12 volt battery, personally, I  let it sit for an hour or so after charging before taking a meter reading:  VoltageState of Charge12.6+100%12.5 90%12.4280%12.3270%12.2060%12.0650%11.9 40%11.7530%11.5820%11.3110%10.5 0%  Avoid discharging the battery below the 40% level whenever possible"
