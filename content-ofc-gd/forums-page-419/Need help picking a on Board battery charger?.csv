685707,Lunkerhunter,2012-04-11 18:20:00,455,how does one determine how many banks you would need for the on board charger?  my boat has a 24 volt bowmount trolling motor and a cranking battery at the back... so 3 batteries = 3 banks???? or because the 2 trolling motor batteries are connected does it only need 1 bank?
685710,Dan668,2012-04-11 18:32:00,1120,You would need a three bank
685711,Terry,2012-04-11 18:51:00,14456," your outboard engine should keep your starting battery charged, so you need a 2 bank for the trolling batteries"
685712,BillM,2012-04-11 18:57:00,17367,"Speaking of batteries, any of you guys run your kicker and main motor off the same battery?"
685768,fish_fishburn,2012-04-11 21:36:00,1311,I agree with Terry 100%
685770,NANUK,2012-04-11 21:41:00,797," Yes I do, main motor, kicker, electronics, bilge pump and even the riggers of the same battery, but it's a 1000CCA marine starting battery. Real marine batteries are built with thicker plates and can withstand a lot more vibration and pounding on the water compare to regular car batteries. It also helps to have the kicker with an alternator to keep the batteries topped up while you troll for hours."
685785,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-11 22:40:00,10439,  Yes go with a 3 bank. Each battery needs it's own connection to the charger. Some will say you only need a 2 as your motor charges the 3rd battery but with a 3 bank you can be assured that your starting battery will always be fully charged. Even when the boat is not used for long periods. I have my boat set up that way and leave it plugged in all the time (the charger will only come on when the batteries need it). Because of this I leave my batteries in the boat all winter and don't have to worry about hauling them out and periodically charging during the off season.  I know that when the snow finally melts here in the next 3 or 4 weeks that I will be able to pull the boat out and turn the key and it will start and be ready fer fishin'. Now the tons of dog hair from last year are another thing. When is someone gonna come out with an automatic dog hair removal machine?

666714,coreyhkh,2012-02-15 16:34:00,163,"Hey guys I would like to get one of these this year but I am not sure what model I need Basspro sells a bunch, I am looking at the XPS line and they have 5 models. My boat has a 3 Batteries right now 2 for trolling 1 for starting/ fish finder.  Any help on what the best model for me would be welcome."
666716,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-15 16:39:00,1622,"I bought the XPS at Bass Pro 5-5-5 2 years ago for the same set up & a buddy bought one last year, no problem yet, plug it in every time I go out & leave it plugged in all winter, just check the water level in the battery once a month, something will likely be on sail in March, keep your eyes open Tight Lines SBK"
666769,doubleheader,2012-02-15 19:31:00,497,Have you considered MinnKota? I think they have some rebates going now. From what I've read they are excellent chargers.
666778,fish_fishburn,2012-02-15 19:58:00,1311,Pro Charger. Check en out.
666783,coreyhkh,2012-02-15 20:05:00,163,Are they all simple to install?
666786,Roy,2012-02-15 20:26:00,13728,"They're ultra easy to install. Also, all you need on your boat is a 2-bank. There happens to be a really good one in the classifieds dirt cheap. Jump on it."
666831,ah_long,2012-02-15 22:32:00,354,"Dual Pro are probably the best, and then the new Minn Kota Chargers  then you have the Guest, Promariner brands"
666850,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-15 23:46:00,10439,Been running one of These for a couple of years. It keeps all 3 of my batteries topped up and gives full output to each battery in sequence but if the battery is charged it is taken out of the rotation. Was super cheap when I purchased it on sale and has a 5 year warranty!!!!

Any help would be appreciated guys, \Ill chec k out the one up for sale on the site as well."
666926,FishAbout,2012-02-16 02:21:00,106,If your charging deep cycle batteries you want a charger with a slower charge rate. Deep cycles are spose to be charged slow or you will kill the life of the battery. Starting batteries can be charged at a higher rate.  I see many batteries killed every year because of this.
666985,ah_long,2012-02-16 04:04:00,354,"I heard good and bad things about the Promariner 20 Plus Gen 2, it seems like a hit/miss thing.. I was almost going to pull the trigger on it but I went with another Dual Pro (Pro Charger) Sportsman Series SSIII (3 bank x 10 amp)"

666999,wormdunker,2012-02-16 10:53:00,1711,"Thanx for the link.  That battery is awesome!  Their ad states ""no trickle charger needed, loses only 10% of charge over a year of static use"".  What does ""static use"" mean?  Can U recharge these batteries, cause after 5 years now you have used 50%.  Can any one enlighten me?"
667474,NBR,2012-02-17 15:25:00,163,If you depend on your motors charger to charge the cranking battery sooner or later you'll have a dead cranking battery. Get a 3 bank and be done with it. Unless you run long distances you need to charge you cranking battery.
667475,lew,2012-02-17 15:36:00,12766,"My current boat has a MinnKota charger as that's what came with it from the dealer and sofar it's been good.  On another new boat I bought back in '99 I installed a Guest charger and that one has been flawless, even now after 13 years of service and another owner of the boat.  If I was to recommend a charger today, or if I was buying another one, it'd definetely be a Guest without question.  I've heard negatives about alot of different chargers on the market, but I've never heard a bad word about Guest."
667476,silveradosheriff,2012-02-17 15:40:00,1025,Happy with my Minn Kota.
667569,Jer,2012-02-17 21:23:00,1426,"I used to have an XPS from Bass Pro, it crapped out after only a couple years. I replaced it with a Minn Kota several years ago and have had no issues since."

669543,msp,2012-02-24 17:06:00,1336,Same thing happened to me. No issues with the Min kota
669805,Sebastian,2012-02-25 13:15:00,208,"I am also looking for a charger and i have a few questions of my own. My lund had 2 batteries in the back(starting, and another for downriggers,electronics and such) and another one up front for the trolling motor. Im not sure what kind of charger it has(assuming it does since i've never had a battery die) but I just got a 101lbs 36Vtrolling motor and i need to have 3 deep cycle batteries up front. Do i need a 3 or 4 bank charger?  Im also looking to pick up a basic Lowrance Mark 5X-DSI for the bow just for some muskie fishing. Any thoughts? Wire it to the back of the boat or is it okay with the front trolling batteries?  I have so many wires running through the boat now and its starting to get confusing."
669813,Tybo,2012-02-25 14:32:00,1373,Run the sonar to the cranking battery and use a battery switch between cranking and rigger.Use duel purpose for cranking riggers.  I have my boat wired this way.Every thing is wired to the main cranking with one charging bank.A rigger\kicker battery wired with a battery switch.Then a ground wire between the two batteries which allows me to charge each battery with any engine I choose too use. Then switching the switch to all allows the charger to charge both cranking.
669814,Sebastian,2012-02-25 14:54:00,208,Thanks. I've been looking into the Stay n Charge system that charges your trolling batteries when running the outboard and also when you tow the boat. It has great reviews with a good price to boot.
669817,Tybo,2012-02-25 15:07:00,1373, This charging system do they charge 12 volt or do they come 24 or 36.If they don't do multi you would need on for each deep cycle.
669831,Sebastian,2012-02-25 15:51:00,208,24 and 36. It looks full proof with tons of good reviews. The only thing i would have to do is install a 7pin harness on my pathfinder.
