680797,irishfield,2012-03-28 01:28:00,26272,Well we weren't gonna lie to you!!  Glad it worked the way it should!
681002,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-28 14:14:00,130,"YOU CAN WELD IT WITH A TORCH AND AN ALUMINUM ARC WELDING ROD...CLEAN THE AREA WITH A STAINLESS STEEL BRUSH FIRST. THIS CAN BE A LITTLE TRICKY... SO IF YOU NEVER WELDED WITH A TORCH, THEN MAYBE YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO WITH THE EPOXY IDEA'S...GOOD LUCK"
686418,radar,2012-04-14 18:18:00,138,"Not to dredge up an old topic, but can anyone tell me where I can get sealed blind rivets in Markham/Durham area?  Been to the hardware stores Brafasco and Fastenall in Markham and Pickering areas and they don't have stainless or aluminium sealed blind rivets in stock. Anyone know where I can get them. Princess Auto?  I've just redone the floor of my 17' Springbok and love the extra space without the old beat up livewell. I am going to leave it out and patch the through hole.  Thanks"
686420,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-14 18:36:00,10439, I purchased mine through Hanson Rivet
686496,tomO,2012-04-14 23:41:00,363,"I got mine at a supply store called fastenal, I think they have a webb site."
677819,tomO,2012-03-20 03:40:00,363,"Ok I know this has been covered before, I've got a small crack on a rib( If thats what you call it)that runs the length of the boat on the out side of the hull on the bottom several years ago I jb welded it and it lasted  several years  but it's leaking again. I was going to grind off the jb weld and want to patch it but not sure how too. The rib is rounded and would need some thing flexible to mold around it i've seen some things about patching with fiber glass. I know the proper thing to do would probably be to pull the floor and foam and weld it but the crack is only about half  too 3 quarters of an inch long and hasn't gotten any bigger. The jon boat is 40 years old so I'm not worried about the looks. Any ideas thx."
677824,irishfield,2012-03-20 03:53:00,26272,"You patch your aluminum boat with fiberglass and I'll go screw a piece of aluminum to someones fiberglass hull!!  Tracker?  Stop drill the crack ends.. beyond what you can see presently. Then make a patch to drill, seal and rivet to the hull... similar to this one on a.. god no.. Grumman ."
677826,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-20 04:13:00,10439,"What ^^^^ said. Drill 1/8"" hole at each end of the crack to stop it from spreading, fashion a patch to fit over the area (with a decent amount of overlap (1/2"" or so)), use a goodly amount of 3M 4200 or 5200 (slow cure, fast cure) and apply the patch. Fasten with rivets and allow sealer to cure. It will not leak again."
677827,irishfield,2012-03-20 04:31:00,26272,I refuse to pay $20 for a tube of sealer... Sikaflex 1A in Limestone or Gray.. under $7
677862,tomO,2012-03-20 12:51:00,363,Ok thx but the area that needs patching is rounded and raised up off the main hull so a rigid patch won't work.  It';s not a tracker its a beater.
677866,Ralph Field,2012-03-20 13:08:00,1018,"There is always the option of using the epoxy made for this purpose. It used to be sold at CT. Clean the area then heat the area with a propane torch, then melt the epoxy with the torch and allow it to settle in the crack. Drifter 16's solution is likely better than my cheap solution, because he has more knowledge of boats."
677877,grt1,2012-03-20 14:40:00,638,a couple years ago i got a pair of 14 boats that were in rough shape. I got some of the green stick epoxy from cabelas and did every rivet with it. those boats have been cached for over 5 years now and only a couple minor leaks appeared. If you got the green stick and filled the holes with it you might get away with a cheap fix
677879,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-20 14:51:00,10439, Just form a piece of aluminum to fit the area.
677917,tomO,2012-03-20 17:49:00,363,Ok got some thinner aluminum might have to double it up and some sika gray and quarter inch rivets . Gonna try and scrape off the jb weld and start forming the metal.
677932,davey buoy,2012-03-20 19:29:00,5505,"The advice given is probably your best bet,my gruman canoe took a hit from a tree and I bought this aluminum compound I'll call it,can't remember the name,but rolled in your hand ,almost a putty, stuffed it into the cracks and leaking areas,not one leak. That was three years ago and you can sand it down. It was a tube and bought it at a local hardware Robinsons,and they swear by it. Never leaked a drop.Great stuff.If your interested pm me and I'll drop by tomorrow and give you the name.Great stuff,easy to apply."
677936,tomO,2012-03-20 19:42:00,363,"I've got the jb weld cleaned up and the metal formed the only rivets I can find are regular ones, I assume I can seal them off when I'm through? No one in the area has the solid rivets."
677937,tomO,2012-03-20 19:44:00,363,Can I seal the rivets with the sika? thxs again
677948,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-20 20:15:00,10439, Give me your address and I can send you some closed end blind rivets if you like. The pin does not go all the way through them.  I have these in stainless steel.  Sealed Blind Rivets
677951,tomO,2012-03-20 20:26:00,363,Thx drifter but I live in Ohio and that would probably be costly let me do some more checking thx so much.
677954,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-20 20:30:00,10439, Nothing more than an envelope and a stamp.
677959,tomO,2012-03-20 20:44:00,363,"I'm still checking, the stainless steel doesn't react with the aluminum?"
677981,Bass Tard,2012-03-20 22:22:00,128,"Using just an epoxy on a crack in your hull is asking for the crack to come back, get worse.  The glue itself has nothing to hold it together, or keep it from popping off.  I had a similar problem on my Bass Tracker (wich apparently people don't like) when I bought it, there was a tear in the aluminum so to speak, that was right on the the corner of the hull so a straight patch like the ones posted above wouldn't do.  I built carbon fiber/fiberglass boats for over 5 years, so to me the solution was obvious.  I cut a peice of glass bigger than the slit in the hull, marked it, sanded inside of it with some 80 grit paper, and layed the glass on with this epoxy: http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/show_product.do?pid=4882  The patch has been on there for over three years now, I do 35mph on the water and I'm not gentel on it, and there's not leaks at all."
677984,aplumma,2012-03-20 22:51:00,6896,Here is the secret I have as far as any hardware you can dream up and need...http://www.mcmaster.com   Art
678019,tomO,2012-03-21 00:19:00,363,ok thx all I.ve found some rivets. Do I need to rough up or sand the paint off the metal before applying the sika? I can't see where is says to on the tube.
678033,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-21 00:50:00,10439,  I would scuff it up with some fine sandpaper to get the best bond.
678070,F7Firecat,2012-03-21 02:10:00,347,"Always sand the substrate when your doing something like this, aluminum will develop a chalk on the surface that will inhibit a good bond if you dont sand it well.  Just so you know Sika does make a primer for their polyurethane 1a sealant, never hurts to use a primer. Sika Flex products are very good products IMO."
678307,tomO,2012-03-21 21:33:00,363,"Ok got the patch on this morning, I'll let it bake in the sun for a couple days, I'll take it out on the river next week and see if I end up on the bottom. Thx to all."
678310,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-21 21:46:00,10439, Don't forget your water wings just in case!!!!
678315,aplumma,2012-03-21 22:05:00,6896,"If it does start to leak you can open a box of jello and pour it on the crack. While it will not stop the leak it will give you time to get to shore because ""there is always time for Jello.""   Art"
680796,tomO,2012-03-28 01:16:00,363,Well I took the old boat out today and it didn't leak a drop. Thx to all that helped out. The boat is 41 years old and not one rivet leaks amazes me but then again I'm easily amazed.
