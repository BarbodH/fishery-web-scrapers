687254,mike rousseau,2012-04-17 00:38:00,4661,i have ceramic on my f150 and it breaks fine while towing
687257,ecmilley,2012-04-17 00:42:00,2163,"depends if the truck came oe with ceramic then it is engineered into the towing/braking if not may effect braking distances, semi-mets usually give better severe service than ceramics at the expense of noise and dusting, also depends on the quality of the pad"
