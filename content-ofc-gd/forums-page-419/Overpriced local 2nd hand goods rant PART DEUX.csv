Has Garmin Topographic map of Canada ($151.65) loaded onto it.  Asking $375.00 OBO.    REALLY BUDDAY!!?   I can get a brand new one  online, with 2 years extended warranty on top of Garmin's original warranty, with a new Garmin Topo Canada chip delivered to my door for $324!!!!!!!! That's with 13% taxes factored in!!!!  I want to say more but it would be unkind!  Actually .....lol...i should wait to see if it sells and then order a bunch and put them on sale for a huge profit!"
