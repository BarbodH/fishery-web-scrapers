684967,Terry,2012-04-09 02:01:00,14456,"well had the shake down cruise and everything worked well, a far cry from last years problems with my boat fishfinders worked well, love the hds8 big engine and the kicker worked well so I stop and played with the underwater camera and it worked ok too I catch some perch but for the most part I just watched them on the monitor... it's just a lot of fun... Well lets hope things go well all year here is a short video   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/j1rzTn2CJ5g"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
684973,coreyhkh,2012-04-09 02:14:00,163,Awesome what camera do you have?
684985,captpierre,2012-04-09 03:04:00,2521,Glad not to see any gobis
685010,Terry,2012-04-09 09:50:00,14456,I was using a gopro
685011,misfish,2012-04-09 09:55:00,29133,Good to hear bud. Those whities wont be long now.
685043,206,2012-04-09 13:22:00,563,Glad your boat work out good.  Nice video....but what is growing on the perch at the 30-40 second mark? he shows up again later in video aswell.
685044,Terry,2012-04-09 13:33:00,14456,I don't know what it was but it was pretty nasty looking..it didn't seem to bother him though
685045,Nipfisher,2012-04-09 13:36:00,2449,  Noticed that too. Yuck.
685046,bushart,2012-04-09 13:39:00,2628,That's really cool
685055,johnnyb,2012-04-09 14:03:00,3413,"Good stuff, Terry! I knew you were up to something....I kept getting youtube notifications as you uploaded videos"
685065,Terry,2012-04-09 14:18:00,14456,"LOL, well I did it from a motel room with the slowest internet I have ever seen since dial-up took hours to get it to upload without timing out......  I had hours of video but a few minutes of downsized video was all I could do  I love watching the little buggers play under the boat"
685087,mercman,2012-04-09 15:17:00,7054,Awesome Terry !!! I could watch fish like that for hours !!! Very relaxing. Glad the boat is working good. I remeber feeling bad for you last year
685134,aplumma,2012-04-09 17:21:00,6896,Nice job glad the shake down run didn't have any bad things pop up. My Ranger didn't dewinterize very well this year my fuel pump diaphram assy went South on me...o well better in the driveway than the lake.   Art
685139,Joey,2012-04-09 17:33:00,9122,Very cool Terry.  Glad you got to get out
685141,limeyangler,2012-04-09 17:45:00,5204,Thats awesome Terry...really cool video.  Do you have that Gopro on a string or something...whats the set up?
685144,Terry,2012-04-09 17:58:00,14456,"thanks everyone..I did have a battery that did not survive the winter but everything else made it   well I happen to have a bunch of underwater cameras, so I strapped the gopro to the cable just above the camera . so I used the other camera to see where I was pointing and recorded with the gopro . I had one of the settings wrong one the gopro so I am hoping to get a better picture next time..that's the only problem...you don't see how it is working till you put them on the computer..."
685172,coreyhkh,2012-04-09 19:10:00,163,What do you find is the best settings for under water shots with the GoPro.
685173,Terry,2012-04-09 19:17:00,14456,this is the first time I used it underwater  ask me again at the end of the summer and I might be able to answer it I do have a flat lens..but maybe I should have sprung for a more expensive one  I had it set as if I was shooting from inside a vehicle and that is wring but I had it in the jeep recording my driving and forgot to turn it off
685181,fishnsled,2012-04-09 19:58:00,3520,Nice to know that the boat is running fine. Cool video as well Terry.
685426,Leecher,2012-04-10 17:24:00,7832,That's some good perchin grounds in that video   How deep was that footage taken Terry?  Looks shallow
685437,Terry,2012-04-10 18:16:00,14456,They were 6 to 8 ft deep  and that was a jig going to the bottom and the fishes diving to get it
685488,LeXXington,2012-04-10 22:30:00,1928,Very nice vids Terry.  Thanks for sharing  I think it would be great to get out fishing again... Yummy perch
685700,Terry,2012-04-11 17:36:00,14456,yeah I could use a meal of perch too you can't tell from the video but they were all too small for my liking.. and that one with the thing growing out the side of it's head threw me off eating any that day
686220,Christopheraaron,2012-04-13 17:37:00,3525, nice fish
686224,Roy,2012-04-13 18:14:00,13728, Stalker!
