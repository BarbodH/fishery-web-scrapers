617857,canadadude,2011-09-01 20:44:00,769,"hey my freind, this message may get to you.......there are lots of walleye off maitland,you need to change your trolling style, if your marking fish it's time to s bend, stall your boards, walleye fishing is not like salmon, you need to fish them, lots of turns, flutter the baits. Just going out and pulling lure's may get you 1 or 2 eye's but the dudes getting #'s are fishing them, like I say s bends, throwing the motor in neutral, fluttering a harness off the rigger. the best advice I can give you is think walleye, troll at 1.9- 2.2 and steer alot. If your marking fish s- bend them work the school. Unlike other fish walleye need some enticing to hit ."
