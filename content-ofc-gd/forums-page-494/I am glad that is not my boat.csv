617992,Roy,2011-09-02 10:09:00,13728,"It's over. Quick, pitch a few under that dock! There must be hundreds of smallies under there right now!"
617993,Roy,2011-09-02 10:12:00,13728,"In 10 minutes, the water temp must have dropped 7-8 degrees eh?"
617994,ckrb2007,2011-09-02 10:20:00,449,Instant speed holes.
617999,danbouck,2011-09-02 11:00:00,4380,That's insane!
618001,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-09-02 11:11:00,1362,That's identical to what we experienced here on the Ottawa River one night at the end of June this year   .....my wife's new SUV needed $3500 in hood and roof repair and the insurance has just authorized the go ahead to replace the steel roof on our house due to the damage from the hail....$20K worth
618006,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 11:46:00,7971,Wow...that's insane!!!
618009,Lunker777,2011-09-02 12:09:00,866,"That happened here in Chatham a few years ago. I watched the whole thing from the 4th floor apartment. The wind was blowing against my building and the hail was smashing against the windows. I was running back in forth like a mad man waiting for a window to blow out. Luckily none of mine did, but some of the other tenants didnt get so lucky.  The dents in cars were insane, My grandparents honda accord had over 1500 dents in it!!!! Roofing companies sprang up everywhere also, because everyone was getting new shingles and new siding !  It was a pretty wild event !"
618013,lew,2011-09-02 12:28:00,12766,Mother Nature can do some nasty stuff when she wakes up in a lousy mood.  That storm is unreal for sure !!

618073,GreenCanada,2011-09-02 17:19:00,375," Natural News is one of, if not the most fear mongering and misinformation spreading websites I have seen. The problem isn't that it's ridiculously biased, it is that the people who believe their drivel REALLY believe it."
618079,Dara,2011-09-02 18:13:00,3052,Wouldn't want to be caught in the middle of a hundred acre field when that hit
618109,DRIFTER_016,2011-09-02 21:03:00,10439,  Or out in the blue zone on Lake O!!!
618484,Entropy,2011-09-05 01:55:00,747,"Wow!!  3 years a go some houses 5 km to my west needed new siding on their north and west sides due to hail.  Our roof vents had good size dents in them from it, but not the vehicle."
618516,Darrel,2011-09-05 09:12:00,82," That was crazy!!! About 1 minute into the video, you can see the hail smashing holes right threw the patio table on the deck. WOW!!!"
618545,lunkerbasshunter,2011-09-05 12:57:00,2585,imagine being stuck on the water in that?  the black and blue bruises would be there for weeks
618552,tightline,2011-09-05 13:23:00,322,Wow ...Mama Nature laid the hurt on that place for sure...Shes a strong willed force when she wants to be!!
