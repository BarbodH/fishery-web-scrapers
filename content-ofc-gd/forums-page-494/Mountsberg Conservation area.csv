618107,canada414,2011-09-02 20:58:00,40,I went to Mountsberg the other day and the water level was extremely low. Its a shallow lake to begin with and It looks to have lost about 3-5 fow. Does anybody know if this is a usual occurrence or the result of a dry year thanks.  Lukas
618133,fish_finder,2011-09-02 23:14:00,370, Likely due to the drought.  Every reservoir in southern Ontario that I've seen in the last couple of weeks has been down at least 2-3 feet if not more.
618230,streamerstripper,2011-09-03 16:59:00,28,Talked to a CO out there a couple weeks ago - at that point he said it had fallen 4.5ft over the past 8 weeks!  If you have a rowboat (i.e. no weeds snagging a trolling prop) there is still some good pike fishing to be had...fly rod with a floating line keeps you outta alot of the crap
