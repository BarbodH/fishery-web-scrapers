617792,irishfield,2011-09-01 15:39:00,26272,If he did that in Toronto he'd be looking at 10 years in jail and sitting beside the guy that hit the racoons with a shovel!
617794,blaque,2011-09-01 15:48:00,2419,Golfers.......Pfffft!
617796,torco,2011-09-01 15:50:00,656,What a weirdo. Who goes to the golf course and then decides to do this.
617802,Roy,2011-09-01 16:04:00,13728, It could be worse. He could be doing time with some scum who copied a Teletubbies DVD for his 3 year old.
617804,smally21,2011-09-01 16:11:00,993,read the comments after..talk about thread hijacking.....
617914,Dave Bailey,2011-09-02 00:06:00,1641," Simple situation, he didn't obey the regulations. No different than someone fishing or hunting without a license, or with 3 lines in the water in the Kawarthas, fishing in a sanctuary, or all the other things we go after other people for. I have no sympathy for him. It isn't like he was in any danger from it, turtles can't exactly chase you down."
617918,Roy,2011-09-02 00:15:00,13728," Bob Artis, 69, of County Road...well maybe in this case it could have."
617920,ctranter,2011-09-02 00:21:00,543,I think I have a recipee for turtle soup kickin' around here somewhere
617921,maybo,2011-09-02 00:24:00,86,who the hell eats a snapping turtle???
617925,danc,2011-09-02 00:42:00,4677,He could have legally shot it. I can't believe that he didn't have a pistol in his golf bag. I'll bet that he doesn't forget it next time out.
617927,mercman,2011-09-02 00:46:00,7054," I swear i just did it once Roy I was curious, thats all"

617943,Rizzo,2011-09-02 01:25:00,4754,I had a tussle with a snapper last week and I tell you they are one tough animal! I can't believe this guy could kill one with his bare hands. I'd hate to think how many times he had to smack it against the golf cart to kill it because I guarantee you it would be more than 10 times.
617965,tightline,2011-09-02 02:49:00,322,Break the law..pay the price!!
617995,Billy Bob,2011-09-02 10:21:00,5865,"Most likely he'll get a good Turtle Lawyer and serve no time...  Hey, if this was done in Kaliforina he definitely would get off as long as he's a celebrity."
