618065,Rod Caster,2011-09-02 16:10:00,5784,"...very disappointing.    Just kidding, I'll check it out once you get photo posted. Dan has it right. Copy and paste the img code onto your post and then preview it to make sure it worked."
618238,monsterfish,2011-09-03 18:53:00,48,"   Thanks for the help guys! That was my first post with pictures, hopefully more to come.  I have never fished Lake O. I went on Tuesday with Top Catch Charters out of Newcastle, a great time on the water. The 38' boat helped make the rough seas tolerable.  Keep your hooks sharp!"
