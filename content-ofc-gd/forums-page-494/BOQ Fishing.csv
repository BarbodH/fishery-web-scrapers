Just wondering what I can expect to catch up there at this time of year? Whats biting? What tackle should I take? Lures? Any information would be much appreciated...  If it helps, specifically we'll be in the PICTON area.  Thanks in Advance, Rob (A2F)"
617856,Terry,2011-09-01 20:43:00,14456,walleye walleye walleye  you can jig for them or troll for them with deep diving lures like reef runners  night fishing near the weed beds can be great too
617859,ld17,2011-09-01 20:51:00,319,find some weedbeds and crank a taildancer on the edge of the weeds and you will hook up with walleye.
