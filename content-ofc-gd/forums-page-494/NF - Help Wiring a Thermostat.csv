618195,Daplumma,2011-09-03 11:52:00,1961,  You got it now.I sort of thought thats what they did.You could unhook the other wire on the red at the furnace and just use red at the stat.Set the heat anticipator to the gas furnace setting and you good to go.
618199,ccmtcanada,2011-09-03 12:38:00,7971," Ok...so, this heat anticipator...I see lots of those when I google it and I see what it does as far as how often it cycles, but my thermostat doesn't seem to have anything like the pictures I see...  Quick search shows this image...   Mine seems to be all solid state..."
618224,Daplumma,2011-09-03 15:38:00,1961,There should be a switch to set the t stat for the type of heat you have.Used to have to calculate the low voltage load and set the anticipator accordingly.
618240,ccmtcanada,2011-09-03 19:28:00,7971,Thanks everyone!  Its all hooked up and working great now.  Now I have to decipher how to program the thing!!! Lol!
618251,ketchenany,2011-09-03 20:35:00,3229," Installation was easy! Take the manual to work and  blow it up, those 2 x 3"" little books will kill you."
618259,ccmtcanada,2011-09-03 21:20:00,7971, Lol!  I know what you mean!  Its a sad state when this thread generates more responses than my fishing reports!!!
618032,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 14:11:00,7971,"Ok...I decided to get a programmable thermostat...all the other ones I've wired in the past were easy...just match the exact wire colours to the corresponding lead.  My existing thermostat has a 5 wire system...   The new one has only 4 leads...   The instructions to install says ""If you have 2 R wires (which I do...RH for heat and RC for air cond), then connect each wire to its corresponding terminal and remove the jumper"" between the RH and RC terminals"".  So, here's where I'm confused....  1) I do not see ""corresponding terminals"" on the new 4 lead thermostat. 2) The jumpers (see pic below) are not labelled RH and RC...they read RE and HG, which from the instructions say it's for electric or gas systems.    The instructions also say ""depending on your system, you may need to connect 2 to 9 to the thermostat"", but then do not tell you how to do that....  Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks!"
618056,fishnsled,2011-09-02 15:28:00,3520,  I think the problem is that the unit is upside down. Look at the label. Flop it around and you will be fine.   I don't have a clue but thought I'd bump it up for you.
618066,GBW,2011-09-02 16:11:00,8460,"Ah Cliff, this is easy...even I can do it.  ready?  Go back to the store and get a 5 wire system.  Problem solved..."
618067,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 16:30:00,7971,"Will and Geoff...thanks a lot!!!  Since you couldn't help with that, you can come over and help me move a recliner sofa from my basement to the main floor instead!!! Lol"
618069,GBW,2011-09-02 16:44:00,8460,"sorry, I didn't hear that, your phone is cutting out...."
618076,fishnsled,2011-09-02 17:55:00,3520, I'm having the same problem Geoff. Maybe his phone line is crossed with the thermostat.....  When were you looking to do this Cliff ( the recliner sofa)?
618080,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 18:13:00,7971, Whenever you get here...beer and pizza as payment??? Lol
618090,aplumma,2011-09-02 19:21:00,6896,send a P.M. to Dan C or Daplumma they might have the answer.Cliff   Art
618092,Terry,2011-09-02 19:37:00,14456,"what model of stat is it  I think when they are referring to 2 wire, they are talking about a common 2 wire system that will run a gas or oil furnace thermostat  but out of context it's hard to say"
618126,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 22:46:00,7971,"Terry...its a Garrison brand, model THM321.  I'm leaning towards the two R  wires are a common hot wire, so thinking of joining them together.  An electrician friend believes on my older unit they are likely combined inside anyways.  Will research a bit more before trying anything.  Thanks everyone!"
618127,Pikeslayer,2011-09-02 22:49:00,1443,"Cliff, Forget the damn thermostat. Check your pm."
618128,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 22:50:00,7971,Lol Simon...PM answered!
618134,dannyboy,2011-09-02 23:19:00,367,"You may need a 5-wire thermostat: RH(heat)and RC(cooling)are wired separately for power if you have a two-transformer system, the separate 24v transformers supply power to switch cooling and heating. In some cases they are jumpered if you have only a single transformer. W is your heating terminal, and normally will have a white wire. G is your fan terminal, and will normally have a green wire. Y is your cooling terminal normally this wire would be yellow.  If you're not sure call a pro. Good luck. Dan"
618143,Terry,2011-09-02 23:49:00,14456,"would your units be self switching  when you are calling for heat or cooling, power will be sent to both....  would they fight each other....  not sure"
618144,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 23:52:00,7971,"Figured the white (heat) and yellow (cool) would complete the correct circuit and engage either the furnace or A/C.  I will head downstairs and check if there is one or two transformers...if only one, I will bridge them together I think.  Both A/C and furnace were installed together new, so hoping all on one transformer."
618151,JeffBornFishin,2011-09-03 00:45:00,260, PM sent...  Please don't let out the magic smoke Cliff
618153,Daplumma,2011-09-03 00:47:00,1961,How old is the house/unit.Most of the new stuff 1985 on up should be single tranformer stuff.If its a two trans system you will have to lose the rc trans and rewire for a 4 wire stat.Its not hard but I first need to know if its a one or two trans system.
618154,ccmtcanada,2011-09-03 00:55:00,7971," Thanks for checking in here!  The AC and furnace were installed brand new as a package 10 years ago...so that would be 2001.  I followed the wiring in from the AC inside and it goes inside the furnace, so I'm assuming it would be a one transformer setup...."
618155,ccmtcanada,2011-09-03 00:55:00,7971, Thanks for the PM...I've sent one back!  Let out the magic smoke?  I'm confused!! LOL
618157,Daplumma,2011-09-03 01:00:00,1961,  I wondering why they would have a RC from to the stat then unless they jumpered it in the furnace.There should be a circuit board in the furnace.Take a pic of the lowvoltage(t stat wires) and I may be able to muddle thru it.Its not a lennox is it?
618164,ccmtcanada,2011-09-03 01:36:00,7971," Nope, it's not a lennox...thanks for your help!  Here are a few pics...first is the entire board...   This is a close up of the corresponding wiring that runs upstairs... "
618170,ccmtcanada,2011-09-03 02:18:00,7971,If I had looked at the circuit board in the first place I could have answered my own question!!  I see the RC and RH wires are on the same terminal on the board...so I will just join those same two at the thermostat and attach it to the R terminal.  Thanks everyone for the PM's and assistance in this thread...much appreciated!
618176,GBW,2011-09-03 02:37:00,8460,"so, did you go buy the 5 wire unit then?"
618177,ccmtcanada,2011-09-03 02:47:00,7971,"Lol Geoff!  Nope, got some great advice and feel confident now that I heard from a licensed HVAC tech from the board!  Btw...the phone works just fine, will call you when I need that recliner moved lol"
618178,GBW,2011-09-03 02:57:00,8460,"ah all's well that ends well eh Cliff?  I was going to tell you to hook the two up all along but I wasn't home to look at mine to confirm...      Oh and even your post has a problem there so I didn't get it all hence the quote.  I'll swing buy on the ___ in you ____, sound ___ if not then let __ ____ or you ___ on your own..."
