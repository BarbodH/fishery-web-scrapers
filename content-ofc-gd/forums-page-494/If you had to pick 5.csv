617369,Harrison,2011-08-31 12:44:00,2202,"Love that lake.  Popper, senko style bait, topwater frog, Jig(flipping would be mine)or soft plastic rig, and a camera."
617370,Roy,2011-08-31 12:45:00,13728,What's a farkle? Is that like a blue Angel on July 4th?
617378,monsterfish,2011-08-31 13:34:00,48,"I agree with Harrison, but don't forget a few spinnerbaits!  Keep your hooks sharp!"
617387,BITEME,2011-08-31 13:46:00,1968," The word is generally accepted to mean a combination of ""function"" and ""sparkle"", hence, farkle.  F.A.R.K.L.E. -- Fancy Accessory Really Kool Likely Expensive"
617388,BITEME,2011-08-31 13:47:00,1968,thanks Harrison and mofish
617394,Roy,2011-08-31 13:58:00,13728,"Ahhhhhhhh a new word for me. Thanks. You might try a few leopard frogs, deepish in with the boulders while you're having your lunch."
617396,adempsey,2011-08-31 14:03:00,1498,What kind of bass?
617399,Beans,2011-08-31 14:12:00,3339,Jitterbug tubes senkos lipless crankbaits Fin-S minnows or Gulp  All work well just north of there...
617407,OhioFisherman,2011-08-31 14:36:00,6623,"1.) Plastic worm or lizard, I prefer Zoom but it`s your choice. Junebug is always a starting color for me on any body of water, you can mix up the sizes, from 4 to 8 inch and fish them weightless, texas style, carlolina style, or even on a jighead. Carry a lighter color such as watermelon or watermelon blue glitter. 4 inch size works well for smallies.  2.) surface lure, you do want to be able to strain the water, cover all depths. Hard to beat a buzzbait as a search lure, it will cover water quickly, again choices. A weedless frog, tiny torpedo, jitterbug, hula popper, devils horse, zara spook, even a Johnson silver minnow and pork frog.  3.) shallow runner, your choice bandit and manns makes some good ones.  4.) medium runner, bandit, storm.  5.) dredge, a jig and pig, deep running crankbaits, slow rolling a spinnerbait, jigging a blade bait."
