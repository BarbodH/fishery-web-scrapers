618098,wallyboss,2011-09-02 20:08:00,1095,Does anybody know if this company is still in business??  I've googled them and tried www.bluewateroptics.com and their page doesn't open anymore??
618112,uglyfish,2011-09-02 21:18:00,981, as far as i know yes they are. i was talking to the owner at the provincial qualifier in petawawa last weekend.
618115,Terry,2011-09-02 21:29:00,14456,I couldn't find a website for them  I love their glasses  my pair is about 25 years old and still as good as the day I bought them
618129,wallyboss,2011-09-02 23:04:00,1095,"The issue I have is that the polarized film on the lens is all coming off, as per the company rep a few years back it is because of sweat. One arm is crooked and rubbing on one of the lens and i just lost a nose pad.  I had the lenses replaced a few years back and I would like to get them repaired again.  If anybody has any ideas how I can reach them, please let me know."

618138,GoneFishin,2011-09-02 23:31:00,349,Gagnon sports sells a lot of bluewater frames. Maybe give them a call and ask for their number and info?

618156,uglyfish,2011-09-03 00:56:00,981,Greg roth is the owner
618320,fish_fishburn,2011-09-04 09:34:00,1311,I have a pair that has been replaced three times. They always break in the same spot. Right in the centre of the bridge. I took them back to the shop where I bought them  and still they havent been replaced. The shop sent them out in february.  The shop owner said to me that ever since the company switched ownership it has been a real challenge to get any repairs or warranty done. I'm done with Bluewater and I think he is also.
618386,uglyfish,2011-09-04 15:33:00,981,Ur not the first person to have this problem....
618388,landry,2011-09-04 15:42:00,1005,When the previous owner ran it - customer service was very good. I have owned 2 pairs and I would say that they are very average in quality. My latest pair has some lifting of the coating around the edges. I have given up on them and don't want a replacement pair. Maui Jums are far superior but too expensive. Lately I have been buying cheapies instead and they enable anglers to spot fish just as well as expensive glasses - no matter what the marketing hype says. Landry
