618139,Roy,2011-09-02 23:32:00,13728,How come the three most active threads since 2:57 this afternoon are about dead fish?  1- Dumping fish remains into the lake. 2- Bowmanville Creek salmon run and 3- Bronte.
618140,Rod Caster,2011-09-02 23:37:00,5784,I was thinking we were turning into a mechanical/automotive forum for a while there. Dead fish revived us.
618142,Handlebarz,2011-09-02 23:48:00,3790,its the long weekend and the only ones left in front of the puter dont want to think about fishing I guess dead fish talk does not count
618145,cheaptackle,2011-09-03 00:00:00,849,It was a test to see if you're playing hooky?  Michael
618148,spincast,2011-09-03 00:33:00,3279,"its kinda like this ""Here's WINTERNET""   while u can"
618149,Daplumma,2011-09-03 00:37:00,1961,Dead fish tell no tails.
618162,vinnimon,2011-09-03 01:24:00,2593,"  And let the fist fights begin at the one you didnt mention Roy Just for the heck of it, I may go down to flyfish for the last time with a rod im giving to a young lad soon. That sure will baffle a few Using marshmellows and ear plugs on the hook"
618174,hammercarp,2011-09-03 02:35:00,964, Not enough carp anglers here. That's why.
618188,MJL,2011-09-03 05:12:00,2427," Got that right  We fish for something that is plentiful everywhere, grows big, fights hard and are just as inedible as Lake O salmon...The only thing we strip and sometimes poach are corn cobs  I guess you could milk tiger nuts to make horchata"
618190,OutdoorDan,2011-09-03 06:43:00,325,"What are you talking about, carp are yummy!"
618191,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-03 09:55:00,2038,Considering that 95% of the threads on here are NON FISHING RELATED  ..............at least dead fish are FISHING  RELATED.
618193,hammercarp,2011-09-03 11:41:00,964,  So when is our next visit to the Toronto Zoo?
618194,ChrisK,2011-09-03 11:41:00,2772, Thats the beauty of our site man...Could you imagine how quite it would be in here if we only talked about fishing
618214,irishfield,2011-09-03 14:20:00,26272,That reminds me Roy... Andy and I saw a good Carp on Monday. Seagull was having a good feed...
618280,Whitespinnerbait,2011-09-03 23:56:00,2038,  How bout we turn it into a Birding Site...  
618282,MJL,2011-09-04 00:05:00,2427, But ospreys are the ultimate anglers...So it's still going to be a fishing site
618291,hammercarp,2011-09-04 02:02:00,964,Another dead fish post. Are you trying to bump this thread up. Well okay. You can see that even in death carp are as beneficial/good as salmon.
618304,Dara,2011-09-04 03:25:00,3052,I killed 4 fish today....does that count?
618587,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-05 15:28:00,130,"  I agree, why complain?"
