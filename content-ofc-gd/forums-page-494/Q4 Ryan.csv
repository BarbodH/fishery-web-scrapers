618085,Harrison,2011-09-02 18:37:00,2202,It's one of those funky lenses I think.  Back lake Bassin.  Can't beat it.
618088,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-09-02 19:06:00,1107,"Ryan is gone north for the weekend and Dave posted that on FB and from reading the comments the pic is reel,prolly just a effect of the lense or camera angle"
618093,danbouck,2011-09-02 19:38:00,4380,"It's called the ""make fish big"" lens"
618097,GBW,2011-09-02 20:04:00,8460,"guys, I was just kidding as the pic looked funny, that's all."
618104,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-09-02 20:38:00,1107, I figured as much I was just clearing the air because people on facebook were calling it a fake because it looks wierd .but Dave does sorta look like his bobble head in that pic
