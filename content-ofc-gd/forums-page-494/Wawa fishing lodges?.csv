617524,Dara,2011-08-31 20:54:00,3052,a better link  http://www.campanjigami.com/gallery/lodge/index.php?gazpart=show&gazgal=15  you want the lodge/bunkhouse the only web site I have seen where the pictures don't do the place justice.  Fishing could be better but the lodge is to die for
617599,michigander fisherman,2011-09-01 00:51:00,64,Thanks that lodge looks very nice. we have a group of 12 people and our old lodge in geraldton was Wintering lake Resort it was spectacular fishing but unfortunatly it closed last year. if you could send some pics of the interior that would be great. also when you say fishing could be better what exactly do you mean. most all of the 12 guys at the old lodge would limit out on walleye and pike on a 7 day trip is it likely that we could still do that or close to that based on your past expierence?
