618012,mike rousseau,2011-09-02 12:27:00,4661,I have about 20 liters of gas in my tank  The bottle says it treats 30-95 liters...  Do I add the whole thing or half or....   You guys seem like seafoam pros....   How much?  It's for a 40hp 4 stroke outboard...

618015,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 12:38:00,7971,Maybe this website can help...  http://www.seafoamsales.com/how-to-use-sea-foam-motor-treatment.html  It tells how to use it depending on what your needs are....there is also a video there....  Good luck!
618019,Muskieman,2011-09-02 13:06:00,2472,1/2 Can will do just fine.... pour the rest in the crankcase of your truck 1000k before your next oil change.... if you do it yourself notice all the sludge that comes out.  SEAFOAM I put that S#$% in everything !   Randy 
618024,solopaddler,2011-09-02 13:24:00,8605, Really Randy? In the crankcase?
618025,fishnsled,2011-09-02 13:30:00,3520, Check out the link that Cliff posted. You can use that $%@* in everything.
618028,ehg,2011-09-02 13:43:00,2666,Don't often use additives in my outboard. If i do i use SEAFOAM.   Stay seafoamy my fiend.
618122,Sinker,2011-09-02 22:12:00,8692,"Use the whole can in 20 liters. Run it good and hot, let it sit until it cools down, then really run it hard. I do this once a season on mine, but mine is a two stroke. It will clear a lot of gunk out of a carb though, that I know for sure.  S."
