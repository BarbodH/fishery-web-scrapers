617848,Billy Bob,2011-09-01 20:22:00,5865," Mike you have some good tips here and your previous post.....but let me add...  I no longer pick up partners unless it really makes sense.....my boat, my truck, my time = meet me at my house...  I have 4 rod holders I made out of PVC pipes that are strategically place in my boat and are mounted 100% VERTICAL....when a fish is boated that rod goes in the vertical rod holder to prevent rod breakage AND give you 2 hands to handle the fish on the floor of the boat. You can't step on a rod while there in these holders..."
617849,walleyejigger,2011-09-01 20:25:00,876,"If ur going for a couple days (camping) I find it very helpful to have pre-cooked meals ready to go frozen in the freezer, especially helpful when hunting, just need to warm them up and ur ready, I like to eat well while camping and some meals take a long time to prepare and cook, which if u come in late and get up early I'm not in a real mood spend slot of time cooking, a wood stove or the Coleman ovens they have now are great,"

617858,Moosebunk,2011-09-01 20:45:00,3970,"All some solid ideas... even the dynamite. lol.  Much of it, we all do I bet... in our own ways.  Preparing the night before is always key, and hooking up the boat with everything gas'd up and charged, for sure.    Used to have these long runs between spots when living up north.  Sometimes in the colder months, I'd cook/heat pre-made meals that had been frozen in aluminum take-out containers... (ya know, the ones with the lids)  If not cooking on the run, food could be cooking while jiggin' up eyes at a spot.  A hot meal goes a long way when ice fishing for a day too.  At home sometimes when bored, I'll just make it a day of cooking and get the beef stew into the slow cooker first, then whip up a big pot of chili then do a huge soup pot full of chowder, then finally a chicken stew.  In a few hours, can usually get 24-30 big bowl fulls worth of hearty home-cooked meals done.  Here's whats waiting for the next trip, and smooth fall Quinte days.    In a 72 liter cooler, you can place the bowls 3 across and 6 deep giving you 18 meals if going on a fishing/camping trip.  Because they are all frozen, I've had them stay that way for up to 7-8 days in August.  Packing in the cooler, it's best to go 2 deep (6 bowls) then lay a tight-fitted piece of cardboard wrapped with a towel, then do 6 more(2 more deep) with another towel and cardboard, then have 6 on top.  Layered and protected, the lower dishes stay frozen when the cooler is opened only to retrieve a meal.  Bungee cord across the top of the cooler too, handle to handle, just in case it opens a crack.  Just one way to maximize fishing time and get a solid tasty meal without having to take extra time out to prep food.   Other quick food ideas... precook spuds and freeze (they make great blocks of ice) for shorelunch type meals.  Chop chicken, onions and peppers ahead of time, freeze the chicken until needing it, and this way the only thing for fajitas is the kit, and to just add everything into an oiled pan.  Two ways of speeding up meal time with less mess.  Ohhhh, and saved to computer, a master food plan with meal ideas and for shopping helps quicken trip prep time."
617864,troutologist,2011-09-01 21:08:00,951,"Tie your rigs in at your desk while on conference calls. Put the phone on speaker/mute and tie up a bunch of leaders, lindy leaders, spinners or slow death of various lengths, colours with some different twists. Having all the options ready makes experimenting quicker, easier, thus more likely to occur.  This is a good time to sharpen hooks, on everything in your box. Every lure should have hooks on, and sharp and ready to go.  The game plan is key, set up a few spots and then adapt.  For a net I use one of the thicker rubber ones for fun fishing, which tangles less, though does have a spatula type effect since its shallow.  When in the boat, have your release tools at hand and camera at hand.  As fishermen the best activity to save time on or become more efficent at, is the landing, handling and release of fish. This is something I see that can be done much better. There is a lot of literature on the best practices for C&R.  ...also not every fish needs to be photographed, weighed or measured, but that is another can of worms."
617869,smally21,2011-09-01 21:30:00,993,"have 27 rods ready to go -no tying or rerigging, always happens at the worst time anyway  like lew, never unpack yer boat, back up and go  if you want to go fishing you meet at my house!  pick yer spots and leave early, and fish weekdays if ya can!"
617873,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-01 21:49:00,4399,"Wow I didn`t realize fishing could be so organized your like a bunch of Felix Unger`s, if I sleep in and miss the morning bite who cares I`ll try again tomorrow,if I have one beer too many in the afternoon and miss the evening bite who cares I`ll try again the next day.  I don`t over think it!!!"

Putter about from spot to spot, and leave areas slowly incase theres a potential honey hole on the way elsewhere. It may seem like im actually wasting my time but have found lots of unmarked spots and unmarked fish this way!  Coffee ready for the morning and a siesta midday keeps me in a fresh form for the later bite. Pre-trip, i keep a close eye ont the weather for the area im fishing. Prevailing winds especially.Some great tips guys!"

617985,adolson,2011-09-02 05:09:00,783,"I don't have much to add to this, but maybe this, almost seems like a no-brainer:  When shore-fishing where there's a lot of room, I clamp my locking forceps onto the neck of my shirt so I always know where they are. This really saves valuable time when I walk up and down the river bank, and especially handy if I get a pike on.  I don't have a holster or anything like that, and clamping on my shirt works a treat."

But if the roses ain't part of the plan, and what ya want is to maximize every minute of fishing time so you can beat the waters silly, what are some time saving tricks you've learned over the years?

617704,Billy Bob,2011-09-01 12:05:00,5865,GREAT POST IDEA...   I always have my boat hook to the truck the night before but still in the garage (sticking out)....  Coffee is made the night before and all bait is ready to go unless I'm perch fishing on Erie and need to purchase or dip my own.  On the way home I fuel up so I'm ready to go for the next time out.

617707,LucG,2011-09-01 12:14:00,779,"If I plan on gettng up fairly early, I prepare everything I'll need and pile it at the door. Then in the morning when I'm in a rush after sleeping in, its easy to get up and go. Just don't forget the lunch in the fridge."
617708,NAW,2011-09-01 12:14:00,4022,"Pre fishing - I have everything packed and ready to rock.  Any special rigs for that day are tied, and waiting.  I leave a little list on the table of items I need to grab out of the fridge, so I don't forget anything.  Once I start fishing, I'm very patient.  No rush.  Fishing is my form of meditation, I just want to relax.  Post fishing - I make sure everything in the boat is ready for being tailored before I get to the launch.  In and out, not more then a few minutes.  Only once have I been a boat launch hero, when I forgot my plug.  That's really the only time I rush, it at the launch."

617712,Lunkerhunter,2011-09-01 12:21:00,455,i normally eat while moving to a different spot to allow for more time spent fishing when at specific locations  have everything ready prior to even getting in the boat  take a good look at some depth charts or use the navionics app on my ipad to figure out locations to fish before hand so i dont waste anytime fishing bad water  keep my tackle box organized so i dont waste time looking for a lure or untangling a big mess  always have a back up rig so that if my main one messes up i have something already ready to use  im sure there is lots more but thats all i can think of right now
617714,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-01 12:27:00,1022,"Not the safest thing to do in the society we live in today, but I like to pack all my gear into the car (most of the time..lol) the night before. I also like to fuel up the night before and I have a bad tendency to drive a little faster on my way to the fishing hole.  For camping trips, absolutely everything is done the night before, including the boat being hooked up. I also look into how long the drive will be and drive to my destination at night so that I can arrive as the sun is going up, while at the same time avoiding traffic congestion. With this though comes the danger of wildlife on the roadway."
617717,NAW,2011-09-01 12:29:00,4022, Yes.  That is a big time saver!

Thing is though, I never hurry anymore cause if the fish aren't where I am, I'll just move over to where they are.  Fact is, I spend ALOT more time now smelling the roses than I used to."

617730,Homer Is King,2011-09-01 12:55:00,305,"Preping the equipment the night before is key for me. I figure out what fish we are likely to target and rig up the rods accordingly.  When I go ice fishing with the kids I'll rig everything up, rods and tip-ups. I'll even put on the hooks / jigs. I use hockey tape to hold them safely onto the rod handle or tip-up. That way we can start fishing right away. The kids can even set their own gear up as I am drilling holes because they don't have to worry about knots."
617732,Harrison,2011-09-01 13:02:00,2202,"A huge time saver for me, especially fishing new water is to pick my spots/areas before I even leave the house.  I will pull up the maps of the lake and mark the areas I want to try.  This saves bouncing in the middle of the lake wondering, hmm, where do we go try now.  I have a game plan before I hit the water, switch things up here and there depending on weather for example, but stick to the game plan.  Works for me."

617746,eman,2011-09-01 13:41:00,101,"I'll usually plan my locations the night before.  Always keep at least 2 setups going. One for slow presentation, one for fast.  For the fast setup I'll use a quality snap so I can change lures quickly (crankbaits, spinnerbaits, some top water). Some people would be dead against this because it affects the action of the lure. I find if the fish are active then and your using a fast presentation....they'll hit reagrdless of snap swivel."
617750,Billy Bob,2011-09-01 13:49:00,5865,"Oh, one last thing....don't keep any fish....makes filleting and clean up time much faster..."
617758,manitoubass2,2011-09-01 14:07:00,11391,"  I use snap swivels all the time as well and IMO it doesn't keep fish from hitting the lure. In fact, at times I think the slightly slower wobble helps elicit strikes. And it saves an amazing amount of time when you switch it up often  "
617778,bigbuck,2011-09-01 15:07:00,2449,"Doing homework before hitting the water, study the charts and put together a milk run. Boat is already in the water fuelled and ready to go (when I tow, it's checked, fuelled, hooked up and loaded the night before). Gear is cleaned, prepped and set up so all I have to do is hit the water, get to my spot and start washing lures. A cooler filled with a few bottles of water, a couple of sangweeches and snacks is prepped the night before."

I have several rods pre-rigged, one with a 1/4 oz, one with a 1/8oz and another 3/8oz, also a pre-rigged slip bobber rig and a bottom bouncer rig for times I use bait.  I use a ball bearing snap and run a 3 ft piece of mono to the jig to prevent line twist.  I have some different colors and sizes (marabou, swim bait, 1/2 oz, etc) pre-tied to that leader length with a loop end to make switch out easy hung on the carpet side of the boat by my seat.  Several different colors of 3"" grub plastics lying on the dash tray.  Pliers and forceps, jaw spreader (pesky pike) are always in the same place in the boat.  Marker bouy on the ledge by the engine control.  Things like this are, for me, not about speed but more about organization.  Fishing is a lot more than just catching....  "

Fill gas the night before  Less people= less time running around and less clutter in the boat  Keep your boat clean!!!!!    ******** I DO NOT USE A NET!!!!!!!!! Unless the fish is 3-4lbs+. This cuts down time spent getting hooks out of the net... And I've only lost 2-3 doing that this year out of hundreds of successful fish flips into the boat...  Keep extra baits of whatever you primarily use... I keep 2-4 of my favorite cranks in each color... You break a hook... Change baits and fix em at home after..."
