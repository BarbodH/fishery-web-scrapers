618559,tightline,2011-09-05 13:48:00,322,"Now I kinda hate to post this because I don't want every yahoo lurking uld have never guessed you would catch one where he did but as it turns out he sure did(didn't believe it at first but saw the pic and no doubt its a ski!!) Are they common in Lake O or did he get lucky? Can't recall ever seeing a post on it here about anyone actually hitting Lake O for them. I go out to the islands for pike a bit so I guess there""s a good chance of musky being there as well."
618560,Roy,2011-09-05 13:50:00,13728,Was it large or very small?
618562,tightline,2011-09-05 13:59:00,322,"It was about a 3ft'r skinny though..10 pounds at best...beauty stripes on it, pretty little fish!"
618563,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-05 14:00:00,130,Lake Ontario is a big lake and there are muskie in it. It is a surprise depending on where it was caught. If you were trolling for salmon it would be a surprise.  Photoshop that pic and post it?
618564,tightline,2011-09-05 14:04:00,322,He was actually shore fishing!!! I'll try to get the pic from him.
618565,mike rousseau,2011-09-05 14:04:00,4661,Never heard much about lake o musky...  But there must be some at least in the east end... The Larry has a lot... And there are some in quinte... So you would think there are some between the 2   I doubt there in the blue zone tho... Lol
618567,Pigeontroller,2011-09-05 14:23:00,2793,I am willing to bet there are some monsters cruising the open waters of Lake Ontario...Eating all the Salmon and Trout they can get...
618568,Rizzo,2011-09-05 14:25:00,4754,"sure they are there, but a bit of a needle in a haystack unless you're trying some of the more concentrated spots (niagara, st lawrence)"
618569,Pigeontroller,2011-09-05 14:31:00,2793,"If one were to target Muskie in Lake Ontario, hypothetically speaking, I guess a lure like this would be the one to use...   "
618570,tightline,2011-09-05 14:32:00,322,Almost looks to Pretty to use!!!
618571,Pigeontroller,2011-09-05 14:37:00,2793,"Here's one from a few years ago...Apparently 44"" and 30 lbs. Caught on a Rapala J-13 on a rigger in 30 fow, Salmon fishing the south shore in the spring...I do not know the Angler, or anymore info...Well thats not totally true, i know the exact spot but I'm not tellin!  "
618578,Rich,2011-09-05 15:07:00,3927,"Not a common catch, but very possible! I've seen them in weird places in Lake Erie over the years. Makes sense."
618581,GBW,2011-09-05 15:12:00,8460,yes they are possible to catch from shore as I too have caught one from shore on lake O.  It was a hell of a shock for me too.
618583,HTHM,2011-09-05 15:18:00,4082,Kinda like catching a Unicorn. The ultimate incidental catch.
618586,ehg,2011-09-05 15:24:00,2666,About 15 yrs. ago while i was fishing off Pickering a guy caught a similarly sized musky on a shad rap in the winter. Musky and walleye exist in western Lake O. when they are caught they can be big. The walleye in my avatar was caught in western Lake Ontario.
618655,vinnimon,2011-09-05 20:26:00,2593,"Heres one that I posted a little while back, not to far from lake O(in a trib). I have lost another ski in open lake O not too far from shore, not too long ago, that was a fluke incident.  The crank bait is 4 1/4 inchs long, the ski was just under the surface. No need to do the math, because it was huge "
618687,Gregoire,2011-09-05 21:26:00,1397, I'm guessing that ski was conservation released
