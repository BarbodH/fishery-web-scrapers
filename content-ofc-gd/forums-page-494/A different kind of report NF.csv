617951,danbouck,2011-09-02 01:51:00,4380,Well last week was the first time I put my 5 year old Jacob on his ATV by himself. He listened to every word I said and did very well  So yesterday I asked him if he wanted to go fishing. He said yes but after ATVing. So we loaded up his ATV and headed to Turkey Point. I increased the speed so that he could easily go up the hills and through the sand. Again he listened to every word and did awesome. After 20 minutes I just let him ride. This kid is a natural!!!  (BTW his mother smashed the other headlight off lol)                 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eoKJsBYNLc  He figured out donuts pretty fast  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIjsDTTbHFU  We managed to get 15 minutes of fishing in but had no takers. I have a feeling a lot of gas will be used this weekend lol
617956,ctdd2006,2011-09-02 02:08:00,531,what bike is that?  I've been on the hunt for one for a while now but have been nervous that they are all a little too tall for my 5y/o.?  He's been on the electric one since he's been less than two...not worried about him handling...just reaching...???
617960,danbouck,2011-09-02 02:16:00,4380,"It's a Baja 90cc (chinese). I got it off kijiji a couple years ago. It goes pretty fast even with me riding it. I redid all the wiring and gave it a 3"" suspension lift, now it is super reliable.  It is still too tall for him but some added foot pegs, and extended brake levers work wonders."
618005,ccmtcanada,2011-09-02 11:45:00,7971,Five years old?? That's so great!  He's well on his way to being quite the outdoorsman with your guidance
618008,lew,2011-09-02 12:06:00,12766,"Hey Dan, when I was 5 years old...a very long time ago...I also had a car that I could drive, but to make it go I had to push pedals with my feet and it had a top speed of about 1/2 MPH.  Boy, how times have changed"
618030,danbouck,2011-09-02 13:52:00,4380, He does love the outdoors. I have a feeling his toys are going to get expensive though     He does have one of those but prefers the ATV
618031,lew,2011-09-02 14:01:00,12766," I don't blame him Dan, why use pedalpower when you've got horsepower"
618050,Sandbag,2011-09-02 15:11:00,533,"That's just awesome Dan.  I got my 8 year old daughter a little Kawasaki mini-bike a few years ago and she wont go anywhere near it.  I even offered to paint it pink for her.  Would never force it on her, but maybe i should try a small ATV instead.  Looks like hes having a blast.  Cheers  Craig"
