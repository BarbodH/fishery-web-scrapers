618366,MJL,2011-09-04 13:49:00,2427,"From Ask a CO website relating to the exact same subject http://www.outdoorontario.net/AskMNR/mnrfaqfish.html  Question 124:  What should a person do if they were to hook a walleye that would definately not survive if released due to the way is was hooked? Is it up to a C.O.'s discretion or must it still be released?  Asked June 28/00  Answer from the MNR  I am assuming from the context of your question that the walleye that you were referring to was in some way illegal. Otherwise, its butter and flour time! The answer, if the fish is illegal (out of season, under or over size, over limit, illegal gear, etc.) is that the fish must be immediately returned to the water. By regulation, this must be done in a manner which causes the least amount of harm to the fish. Even if the fish were dead, it must be returned."
618385,Gregoire,2011-09-04 15:31:00,1397,"This topic was posted on another forum. Hypothetically the poster wants someone to give him the answer he wants to hear. I have done a fair share of fishing in my day, some of it in rivers and streams. When I use a single barbless hook I find it unlikely that a fish would be hooked so deep that it would die. Hypothetically a 20 inch brookie is a prime breeder with good genetics, and it is a shame that such a hypothetical fish is no longer contributing to the gene pool. If you like to catch and keep brook trout maybe you should be fishing other bodies of water where you are allowed to keep them. Hypothetically they exist, even inside the GTA, despite what your 40 years of experience suggests. And I have caught a 20 inch brookie this year. It was in a body of water where I was allowed to keep it, and I was on a camping trip fishing for dinner. I am sorry if my answer is curt, but I dislike it when a person asks a question but only listen to the answers that he wants to hear."

618391,Roy,2011-09-04 16:12:00,13728,No one should be feeling badly about this thread being hypothetically locked. It only existed hypothetically to begin with.
618234,Alfiegee,2011-09-03 18:40:00,14,"Completely hypothetically,fly fishing on the upper Credit with barbless hooks. A 20 inch speck is hooked and landed. It is bleeding profusely from the gills and attempts to revive it fail. The upper Credit is a no kill zone, what do you do. It is illegal to keep the fish, but it is also illegal to abandon a fish or allow it to spoil. Hypothetically I hid the fish and got out of there. And hypothetically ate the evidence. What is one supposed to do? I wish I could have released the hypothetical fish as it would have been a good spawner and produced lots of young ones that also would have had the potential to reach that size.  Alfie."
618235,misfish,2011-09-03 18:42:00,29133,NOPE  We dont make the laws. Saddly
618236,Spiel,2011-09-03 18:53:00,9065,"Hypothetically speaking it's unlikely you'd do much damage to a fish on a single point barbless fly. But it if happens the ""no keep"" rule supersedes the ""allow to spoil"" rule."
618237,Terry,2011-09-03 18:53:00,14456,we all deal with this with slot sizes and fishing seasons  hiding it on shore would get you a ticket dropping it back in the water is the only legal thing to do...dead or alive
618241,bushart,2011-09-03 19:37:00,2628,Wonderful world we live in Huh?  Member when you went fishin to get supper?  OK Don't wish to start the great freezer debate but sometimes I gotta wonder??
618243,Alfiegee,2011-09-03 19:47:00,14, Specks hit hard when they are hungry and you occassionally get one in the gills. I have fished specks since I was 6. 40 years to be exact. 95% of specks that are hooked in the gills will not live. My hypothetical fish was bleeding badly and could not be revived I tried. I should have hypothetically just let it float away to be turtle food?  Alfie.
618244,Musky or Specks,2011-09-03 20:04:00,2710,Yes because that is the law.  And if you don't and get caught then you deserve whatever fine you get.
618245,Alfiegee,2011-09-03 20:18:00,14,I phoned the ministry and was told this is a very grey zone. Legally the hypothetical fish should have been released to be turtle food. But a C.O. may have seen things differently. The twilight zone indeed..  Alfie.
618246,Alfiegee,2011-09-03 20:20:00,14,"Was the nicest hypothetical fish I ever caught, I only wish I could have live released it so it could spawn again.  Alfie."
618247,Terry,2011-09-03 20:21:00,14456,you must have talked to a call center in India because they have been dealing with this for years and there is zero grey area..it is clear it is well documented.  give me the name of the person you talked to in the ministry and I will have them send you the correct answer...
618250,misfish,2011-09-03 20:33:00,29133,"  I have a cold drink somewhere,,,,,,,,,,,,  Terry,you want to fish Monday?"
618252,Alfiegee,2011-09-03 20:51:00,14, Can I come?
618253,irishfield,2011-09-03 20:52:00,26272,Man.. I picked the wrong month to stop drinking..
618254,craigdritchie,2011-09-03 20:53:00,1586,"The rule exists to prevent people from catching a fish, ripping the gills to shreds with their fingers or pliers, then using that as an excuse to take it home. Which, incidentally, people do all the time.  ""It would have died anyway"" won't cut it with the CO. Get caught and there will be nothing hypothetical about the charge and fine.  I'm just sayin ....."
618260,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-03 21:20:00,0,there definitely isn't a grey area. it's unfortunate but as long as you take every reasonable step to release the fish you've done your part and can not be charged.
618272,misfish,2011-09-03 22:31:00,29133,  Ask terry.
618276,Alfiegee,2011-09-03 23:10:00,14,Terry?
618278,fishinguypat,2011-09-03 23:23:00,547,hypothetically speaking it can be done hypothetically
618283,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-04 00:05:00,130,CYA: put a reasonable effort into and let it go. If you keep it you will be labelled as a poacher. Same thing if it is out of the slot limit.  What on the surface seems like a contradiction is not. It is similar to catching a Muskie on a conservation license.....what happens if it dies? If an acceptable excuse for keeping a fish was that it could not be revived there would be no stopping people:  1) keeping more than their limit 2) keeping OOS fish 3) fish out of the slot
618306,crossover,2011-09-04 03:42:00,172,Putting the dying fish back into the stream atleast provides nutrients for the ecosystem.
618310,Alfiegee,2011-09-04 04:34:00,14," I know that, but I'm talking about a beautiful speckled trout,hypothetically. Anyone else catch a 20 incher lately? Hypothetically?"
618317,Twocoda,2011-09-04 07:41:00,4130,i cant believe people would hypothetically eat ANYTHING out of the Credit
618349,Rich,2011-09-04 12:38:00,3927," I've caught 20 inchers, but they sure didn't hypothetically go in any frying pans.  I've seen people use the same excuse with a pile of bass on the ice next to them.  I guess if you let them take the live worm in deep on those tiny trout hooks, oh sorry I mean fly.."
618356,Musky or Specks,2011-09-04 13:16:00,2710,Look at the post count. The guy is obviously an idiot and a troll
618358,splashhopper,2011-09-04 13:26:00,2931, Yep... what the heck are u gonna do when goofy season comes this winter !
