617786,Jigs,2011-09-01 15:25:00,136," Could very well be. This is a quote from Ken Dryden's book about it. Sad story and a rough summer for hockey.  ""If it is true that a sports career prolongs adolescence, it is also true that when that career ends, it deposits a player into premature middle age....His illusions about himself, fuelled by a public life, sent soaring then crashing, have disappeared just as those of his contemporaries have come to full bloom."""
617816,K_F,2011-09-01 16:58:00,107," that video gives me chills  he sat out over 10 games prior to that fight, he later revealed that he returned for that game with a separated shoulder  he was a gamer"
617818,SirWhite,2011-09-01 17:29:00,210,what a shocker  havent watched hockey in a long time but when i did one of the reasons was Belak on the Leafs  sad  RIP Wade Belak
618083,BassMan11,2011-09-02 18:26:00,583,Wade was a great one. I was at the last game he scored a goal as a leaf. The crowd went crazy. The whole crowd chanting his name. Last game I was at in Toronto. Rip wade. Thanks for the memories.
618171,lovetofish,2011-09-03 02:22:00,500,"Been a Leaf fan and Dean Blundell show for a long time!  RIP Wake, way too young and way too good of a guy!!!  lovetofish"
617555,ckrb2007,2011-08-31 22:53:00,449,Wade Belak was found dead today in a Toronto Condo. An accidental overdoes of prescription drugs is believed to be the cause. Another one gone at a very young age.
617576,Musky or Specks,2011-09-01 00:12:00,2710,Dang I can't stand hockey but the guy was always hilarious when he would come on the Dean Blundel show.
617578,GBW,2011-09-01 00:15:00,8460,"when did anyone release an OD on drugs?  Right now everyone is saying ""cause of death is unknown at this time""."
617587,Jigger,2011-09-01 00:30:00,1237,Unreal. Another one gone so soon. My thoughts go out to his family.
617596,Lostchild,2011-09-01 00:48:00,153,"Condolences to his wife and two young children...and to the rest of his family, friends and fans.  Lots of speculation on the cause so soon, the only thing police have confirmed was it is non-criminal. The Toronto Sun is reporting a ""source"" saying that he hung himself??? (take that for what it is worth) Personally I have no opinion on the cause of death all I know is 35yrs old is far too young!  R.I.P. Wade"
617610,fishinmortician,2011-09-01 01:10:00,100,"Wade was the only reason I kept the leafs game on the tv.  But, if I was scheduled to be on battle of the blades, (hockey players prancing around figuire skating if you don't know the show) I would probably do the same thing!"
617614,jedimaster,2011-09-01 01:22:00,3472,"Wow that's too bad. A very funny guy that played with heart and had his whole life seemingly laid out for him. Beautiful wife, 2 kids, solid money, fame... This is just a shame. Rip belak."
617615,Grimace,2011-09-01 01:25:00,2020,"He was one funny dude.  I sure hope he wasn't tormented by depression or have an addiction of some sort.  It kind of seems that Enforcers, concussions, heavy painkillers (for said concussions) and depression are intertwined.   I sure hope that this isn't the case here."
617627,Rizzo,2011-09-01 01:51:00,4754,wow sad to hear. This summer can't end soon enough for nhl tough guys
617641,tb4me,2011-09-01 02:31:00,3295,"Rip Wade..   <iframe width=""420"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/k6PCGDlVP_I"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
617650,NAW,2011-09-01 03:10:00,4022," On the National tonight they confirmed it was suicide..  Very say to here.  It sounded like Wade still has a lot going for him in his post NHL career.   Damb..  3:50 of that video above, and on..  I didn't know he had two kids (didn't read all the posts above).  That's rough."
617652,ckrb2007,2011-09-01 03:15:00,449," At the time I posted my original thread, Yahoo sports did have on their site that it was cause by an OD of prescription drugs. I guess it has since been removed. My apologies for jumping the gun. I only stated what I read.  Colin"
617663,Toronto_Angler,2011-09-01 04:05:00,698, Real Classy Buddy
617667,Lunatic,2011-09-01 05:54:00,536,RIP Wade. he was one of my favourite players and i always looked forward to any of his interviews.
617686,Familyfisherman,2011-09-01 10:16:00,188,"So sad when you watch that video -- his wife seems like a lovely lady and with the growing family...just awful.  You can look like you have it all together, but life can really wear people down.  Too bad he wasn't able to get some help..."
617693,tightline,2011-09-01 11:23:00,322,http://www.news1130.com/sports/article/272626--nhl-enforcer-belak-s-death-met-with-sadness-shock  So sad...So young
617700,grimsbylander,2011-09-01 11:53:00,3016,Wow. What the heck is going on with these youngs guys? Too much of everything maybe. Sad news.  
617731,blaque,2011-09-01 13:00:00,2419,"Ya this is like the 3rd ""enforcer"" type player to pass since i think May"
617734,K_F,2011-09-01 13:05:00,107,"Wade was my favorite Leaf for years.  Between his style of play, personality, tsn and 102.1 spots he was  hard not to love.  He did one spot on tsn where he suggested that he became an enforcer so he wouldnt steal Sundins thunder as a goal scorer.  When questioned on the topic he referenced his minor hockey stats in Saskatoon.  I have a Belak Jersey that I wore to many games and was never able to get autographed.  2 years ago with the news of the trade to florida I contacted his agent.  He was able to get my jersey signed and shipped back to me.  Wade was a solid guy who wont be forgotten."
617763,eman,2011-09-01 14:13:00,101,RIP Belak - In interviews he sounded like a fun jovial guy
617764,GBW,2011-09-01 14:20:00,8460,RIP Wade.  He was a great person.  I had the chance to golf with him a few years ago and I've been mad at myself for missing the chance ever since.
617767,Nipfisher,2011-09-01 14:31:00,2449,Sad to lose Belak. He was a funny guy and a decent enforcer. You would think the NHLPA would do more to lok after these guys?
617773,bigbuck,2011-09-01 14:49:00,2449,"Sad to he him go out like that. He was a good solid player, and a good guy to boot. RIP."
617774,addy79,2011-09-01 14:55:00,573,"Rest easy Wade, You've earned it...    Stickin up for Kabby, gotta luv 'em"
617777,Oryx,2011-09-01 15:00:00,186,"RIP Wade.  Sad that depression  has the stygma that it has.  From what I have heard and seen, athletes will have a higher occurance of this than the general population.  It has something to do with being the best at what they do (he may have not been the best hockey player...but how many of us were in the NHL) and then wake up and it is all gone.  I feel for his children and his wife."
