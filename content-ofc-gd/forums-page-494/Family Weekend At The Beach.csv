Our first view of Huron brought some excited chatter from the back seat.     The oasis for our weekend getaway was incredibly private, the driveway being a small preview.     Old weathered plank floors, perfect for wet sandy feet and decor that matched. Right on the beach, it was perfect...                 The beach, private and dog friendly was amazing. Kids and pooch were in their glory.        <iframe width=""420"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/RGvO66rI3as"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>     Friends joined us and a perfect golden day blended seamlessly into a star filled night, campfire on the beach, and lots of sticky marshmallow covered faces.      Everyone was beat, including the pooch.    Saturday was special, it was my little girls 8th birthday.  The kids took great pleasure in decorating the cake.      My young daughter is growing up way too fast...  <iframe width=""420"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/DmHV0qqaTYk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   Later that evening we trekked over to Kincardine. Every Saturday night during the summer the pipe band has a parade through town. Great fun.  <iframe width=""420"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/3uhnN3IL0Dg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  It was a great way to end the summer for everyone and a perfect way to celebrate my girls birthday.  (MUCH more appealing than taking 12-15 squealing 8 year olds to Chucky Cheese )  'Till next year  "

617907,solo's girl,2011-09-01 23:49:00,9,  Thanks!  It was a super fun weekend.   
617929,NAW,2011-09-02 00:56:00,4022,There used to be an awesome diving board on the pier in town there.  Double decker thing.  Lots a fun.   Not sure if it's still there though.
617930,Twocoda,2011-09-02 00:57:00,4130,im going to take a guess and say ....Lurgen Beach? or Point Clark area.....Happy BDay to your daughter...its a good thing she isnt growing as fast as Zoe   Diving board has been gone since 2000
617982,sconceptor,2011-09-02 04:33:00,146,"I know the side road you came down in the first pic, and have an idea where the cottage is....  damn'A, dogs allowed on the beaches in most of Kincardine area.....not like South or Port.  I hate that about my new area.  Sure I understand main beaches, but come on, cottage road beaches with limited access?  At minimum allow dogs on beaches with leashes and poo and scoop rules!  Nope everything up and down the coast in the new area is posted no dogs.  Dogs love water, everything from the labs to the shih tzus, so it's a real shame by laws are put in place to restrict it!  There's already by laws for leashes, and if you have a dog that might attack or be considered dangerous be respectful and use the leash and mussle!  If you have a dog that's trained enough not to run up and down and potential scare people/kids, sure throw the stick out in the water and up and down the beach!"
617996,solopaddler,2011-09-02 10:22:00,8605," Stupid numbers of fish pic's will be posted later today.      Not on this trip. That was made crystal clear to me before we left LOL!    No kidding eh?      Close, very close,Bruce Beach.     Well to be truthful I believe dogs are supposed to be leashed on that beach. Everyone else walking on the beach with dogs had theirs leashed.  But our dog never strays, always stays close.  No way was I going to tie her up unless I was forced to.  Went for an 8km run on the beach Saturday morning and she stayed right by my side the entire time.  As a somewhat new dog owner I've found many of the dog related bylaws to be incredibly frustrating.  My dog needs to run off leash every day, she's a high energy breed. If she doesn't, well let's just say she's a different dog.  There's virtually nowhere close to where I live where she can run.  Closest place is a 20 min drive and I'm bringing her there almost every day.  Unfortunately responsible dog owners are paying the price for a few bad apples."
618034,ehg,2011-09-02 14:15:00,2666,Another great report Mike! Even though there was no fish the the quotes above show how you were inspired by taking your family out again to the great Ontario outdoors. Thanks for the efforts of sharing this great experience.
618036,fishnsled,2011-09-02 14:21:00,3520,"All about balance and some give and take.	Looks like a great family week Mike, thanks for the report."
