616152,manitoubass2,2011-08-27 06:31:00,11391,"After a few slow weeks, the bite picked up big time!!!! Yesterday I went out and fished the shores and shallows from shore, went 17 for 21, in 5 hours. Those fish had bellies too!!! That doesn't usually happen until mid september, so now I'm all excited, hehe.  7 of those fish weighed over 3lbs, which is great considering I nabbed them in the rapids, biggest one was 19.75"" and at 4lbs.  Tomorrow, the goal is to take pics of at least 20 fish, from shore. Might go out in the boat too for an evening bite? I'll keep you posted.  The plan is grubs on heavy jigs burned through the shallows, but we'll see how it goes. I just have that need to hook fish's  Hope you all have a great night and a great day tomorrow! Great fishing OFC, and as always, I'm jealous of those who fish lakers, salmon, carp, musky!!!!! LOL"
616153,Roy,2011-08-27 06:56:00,13728,Good luck. Stay with the bass. Manitoucarp sounds sick.
616154,manitoubass2,2011-08-27 07:18:00,11391,"  lol, true.  May the farce be with me. I gotta a 12 pack in the fridge awaiting my disappointment  "
616177,Rod Caster,2011-08-27 12:39:00,5784,Good luck man! The feedbag is on....take advantage
616183,mattp33,2011-08-27 12:51:00,290,So are you catching bass or walters?
616239,manitoubass2,2011-08-27 17:08:00,11391," Bass.  I did catch a few small walters running the rapids though. Just came home for some lunch, then heading back out for the afternoon!!!   "
616357,manitoubass2,2011-08-28 11:53:00,11391,"Quick update.  All in all 32 landed bass yesterday. I took a few small breaks throughout the day when the bite turned cold, then I'd return an hour or so later to the same spot, and the bite was on again! Very fun day, was great weather wise, about 24 no humidity and barely a breeze. Water temps were actually fairly cold, about 70 degrees, down from 74 the day before. Lots of fish, but most were in the 2-2.5lb range today, no real monsters. Also lost about 5 fish.  Heading out again here in about half an hour to the same spot. Weather looks calm and partly sunny, water temp a cool 68 degrees. I'll be interested to see how this affects them this am.  And on a side note, Jeff Gustafson took home the International Falls bass tourny yesterday, fishing right beside me at one point, and bagged a healthy 19.66lbs of smallmouth bass!!! Nice job Gussy!"
616414,Rod Caster,2011-08-28 15:37:00,5784,32 bass... Couldn't make it to 40? Haha that's crazy good fishing
616430,limeyangler,2011-08-28 16:05:00,5204,WHAT...NO PICCIES??
616466,manitoubass2,2011-08-28 18:02:00,11391," I'm done for today, so I'm just uploading some pics now.  Hows Lac Seul been treating you? Looks pretty good from the last report!     "
616468,manitoubass2,2011-08-28 18:03:00,11391," Yep, the bite was on hard and heavy, all small fish though. Today was alot slower, but I had two good smallies, 3.5-4lbs, and a bonus 33"" pike that fought like a ton of bricks in the rapids! Though it was gonna be a monster, lol.   "
616486,manitoubass2,2011-08-28 19:04:00,11391,"This is the am view of the rock point I planned on fishing, right hand side in the rapids   View from the house   The view in the am! Great to look at while having some coffee!  Early morning pike, this guy smashed a crank in the rapids and put up a great fight!   Best smallie of the day, caught on a firetiger crankin rap   UGGGH, another bear sighting, lol   Cub too! Up in the tree   The boys got out with me and my ol man!   Chips on!   Fish on! Monster walleye, 6"", and took home $5 for first fish of the day, lol   32"" pike off the reefs in 30FOW   Early shiner run this year, I wasn't the only ""early bird fishin!   This guy was hooked deep, kept for the fry pan.   Loons were hanging out too   Bonus! "
617410,manitoubass2,2011-08-31 14:47:00,11391,"A few more dinks from the 2 days ago. Lots of 15-17"" fish, but the bite turned off compared to the previous days. Water temps are fluctuating way too much, as much as 12 degrees up and down.      Even bass arm cant make this one look big! lol, pretty colors though  "
617415,Roy,2011-08-31 15:10:00,13728,Good stuff! Looks like a good place to wade too.
617417,manitoubass2,2011-08-31 15:20:00,11391," I wish! It's all slippery rock and weird drop offs. I'm just too chicken to wade at that spot, lol. There is a great wading place right around the corner though that holds big walleye in the spring and fall!"
617458,adolson,2011-08-31 17:35:00,783,"Wow, nice work! I'm lucky if I get one to three fish in a trip... I'm clearly doing something wrong."
617464,johnnyb,2011-08-31 17:57:00,3413,"SMallies, wallies, pike and now lakers?!?!  Very nicely done, man!  Keep it up"
617496,drewbrew,2011-08-31 19:30:00,31,That's some nice catches!
617498,manitoubass2,2011-08-31 19:46:00,11391,"Thanks guys!  Living here def. has it's perks for anglers, lol."
617535,spincast,2011-08-31 21:30:00,3279,sweet day on the water - a nice smorgasboard for the bbq
617648,manitoubass2,2011-09-01 03:05:00,11391,"Got out today as well but only for an hour. Weather was interesting and the water went down again, so so shallow right now. Managed a 27"" pike and a 16"" smally, and four other small pike. It's funny, every year when the night cools off and the water is low, those pike surround this little rock area of the rapids and pin all the bass in there. Inside the rock formation, all bass. On the outside, all pike! lol  A lil' walleye on a DT crank  "
617662,manitoubass2,2011-09-01 03:53:00,11391,"oh yeah, lil smally caught on a rocket rod! lol    An odd pike, this is an old pic I just found.    "
