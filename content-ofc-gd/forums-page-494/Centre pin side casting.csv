I'm using a coke type machine for my egg sacks,I hear they work ok,what's your guys opinion? I have no other source of fresh eggs or skien[spelling].Thanks davey."
618131,Paulus,2011-09-02 23:08:00,522," Ha! Truer words were never spoken!  The only advice I think I can add to this already well-answered thread is to practice the different casts - spinning side-cast, wallis, modified wallis, BC cast (not that I'm proficient at all these styles myself   )- when things are slow. It's a fun way to get the best of both worlds, and eventually the more you practice the more sub-conscious your casting becomes.  p.-"
618135,Sharkbait22,2011-09-02 23:19:00,297,"I use the Wallis mod cast without issue, but I can chuck it further with a side cast - not that I typically need to get that far while floating even in large rivers.  When using a double swivel setup how do you adjust your float?  Are you just limited in the range of depths? Does the swivel slip through the guides? I'm also interested to try superlines on a float reel.  That sound pretty wild. Thanks"
618136,GoneFishin,2011-09-02 23:26:00,349,"I have a question about swivels. Why are you guys running them above your floats? Isn't it harder to mend your line and keep on the surface?? Also, when your break off you loose your float and everything, what is the benefit of running it above instead of below?  Ohh, and has any one tried the nano fill on there pin yet?? lol"
618137,Paulus,2011-09-02 23:30:00,522," The next thing to learn is trotting. You asked about it early on, and I didn't see anyone explain this.  Basically it's what the centrepin is made for, and it's about delaying the drift of your float so that the bait travels downstream in front of your rig. You do it by applying pressure to the spool as your float ""trots"" downstream.  One of the biggest challenges at the beginning is to not ""over trot."" I don't really know any other term for it, but I've seen several new 'pinners' do this, and I have been a long-time victim of this self-inflicted torture myself   (I still catch myself doing it). Basically, if you're over trotting you're pulling the bait up and out of the strike zone in an unnatural way that can spook fish - of course if you happened to tie on something that's supposed to rise (i.e. caddis fly) then you probably should over trot now and again - but most bait is supposed to just move along in the current, at the speed of the flow.  Not sure where you're fishing, but try varying the amount of pressure you put on your spool during your drift. It could bag you a fish  p.-"
618141,Paulus,2011-09-02 23:40:00,522," Largely depends where you're fishing. Whenever I've attached a swivel above the float, I've used it where I knew my lead was not going to exceed roughly 8' to 10' (I use a 13' XST). I've also done it for a portion of the day, if I was fishing a shallower stretch on a deeper river (i.e. the 'Geen) and wanted to get rid of line twist comfortably. If this means re-rigging, then so be it: I don't mind re-rigging as I think that it can be a way bigger waste of time to fish with the wrong setup than to take 5 minutes to do it up right - and fresh.  Also, microswivels are so light and tiny that they don't interfere with mending your line and, for the lazier moments, most float tubing can slide over them pretty easily with a little bit of jimmying.  p.-"
618147,troutologist,2011-09-03 00:25:00,951,  Fishing a pink worm is a great time to experiment with really holding back on the float and letting the worm float up....vicious hits.
616252,davey buoy,2011-08-27 18:46:00,5505,"I'm at least going to try the swivel above the float. Why would one argue"" over ""or ""under"" float?Why is one supposedly better than the other?."
616261,misfish,2011-08-27 20:02:00,29133,"Was down for a couple hours.Nadda,but got to try a few different casts.Love the pin. Learned abit about reading the water as well. Thanks Bill.   BTW It,s a broken bolt on the rad.Zip tied it up, and good to go til Monday."
616262,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-27 20:04:00,0,"the sooner you learn to cast properly the better.  no amount of swivels takes the twist out of side casting and there's nothing worse than having to retie your rig completely half way through the day.  like mr. hamilton said, save the side cast for when you have to make uber-long casts."
616264,Bill Shearer,2011-08-27 20:21:00,456,"Pretty funny to me, reading the responses from those that have obviously never tried tying in a swivel above the float.  Takes about 3 minutes, and give it a try. I change my mainline halfway through the fall season, because of the stresses it receives from being stretched from fish. I could probably use it the whole season, but line is cheap and I hate wasting the 15 minutes to retie, when the fish are ""on"", due to my laziness. Or you can keep replacing line, and dealing with the frustrations of line wrapping around the tip, etc, etc,"
616265,davey buoy,2011-08-27 20:27:00,5505,"After about 4 hours on Friday I did start getting line twists around the tip of the rod.When I got home cut off about 80' or so ,ready for next time with the swivel above the float. Thanks."
616289,BillM,2011-08-27 23:10:00,17367, Sweet!  Glad you got it fixed man.   I'll be throwing hardware for steelies until the end of Sept   That's a great river to do it on.  After the next rain we'll go down and try a couple of my go to spots.
616290,misfish,2011-08-27 23:18:00,29133,"Until then,I,ll be practicing.Maybe a few hooksets in the process."
616295,BillM,2011-08-27 23:57:00,17367,Tie up some big stinky bombs if the water clarity is like it was today.  Dew worms would also be a good idea.
616326,okumasheffield,2011-08-28 02:58:00,318,"I would suggest to spend 2 months (during off-season, of course) to learn how to Wallis cast then no more line twist for the rest of your fishing career!  It would be easier if you already know how to baitcast!"
616331,ctranter,2011-08-28 03:19:00,543,"As with many things related to fishing, everyone has their own opinions, and in most cases, everyone has positive experiences that support their opinions/techniques.  The first cast I learned was a spinning side cast.  It was all I knew for over a season, but I struggled through over-casting and tangles to last a few steelies.  3 years in and I can spinning side-cast across any river I fish.  It's all about matching reel spin with distance, and it takes practice.  No matter what people say, pulling line off the side of your reel causes line twist.  Regardless if people have antidotes to this problem, the line is forces to physically twist off of the spool.  I fished with a very experienced steelheader who exclusively used side casts, and after a full year of fishing together, I had fewer twists and line issues at the end of the year than he did.  Why?  Because I struggled through learning to cast a pin with a method that ensures longevity and peace of mine.  Sure, people will say you should change your line frequently yadda yadda, but honestly I havent changed my 8 lb Gamma in 2 years and it is still perfect.  If I need to cast 30+ feet, I use a side cast.  But as long as I can spin my pin, I cast my line and stop the spool as the line hits the water.  No twist.  There is no single ""best"" way. All there exists are different strokes for different folks, but certain techniques are more practical for small, narrow southern Ontario tribs that others.  I fish with a certified casting expert very often, and he is more than happy to demonstrate a variety of casting methods.  PM me for details  Ps:  I'm sure this question was answered as it is super basic, but the reason to NOT use a swivel above the float is to reduce the amount of lost tackle as lines almost always break below the swivel.  My float is always above my swivel, and I match the conditions of the river with my floats.  Then again, I haven't bought a float in over a year as I find all of my floats in the river.  Thanks folks!"
616345,spinnerdoc,2011-08-28 04:26:00,556,"I'm no expert at it but when i started to learn how to cast i startted with the modified wallis cast...it's the only cast i know and use so give it a try. I get good distance and control interms of direction with it.  I did try the swivel above the float and i like it, it was good when i was learning the cast and later on stopped it all together."
616375,BillM,2011-08-28 13:41:00,17367," I've never had a break off below my top swivel (ie losing my entire rig)..  I also spend a fair amount of time on the water, lol!!  I run 14lb Fireline Crystal, to 8lb Drennan Super Specialist shot line, to whatever leader I am running for the day.   I've even landed some nasty Port Hope chinnies on this setup."
616383,davey buoy,2011-08-28 14:06:00,5505,"I take it BillM the swivel above the float will make the float a little top heavy?,than again it must depend on how much weight you have on your line pulling down."
616390,BillM,2011-08-28 14:20:00,17367," We are talking about a XXXS micro swivel   They are tiny.  Doesn't affect the float at all, regardless of where it is in the setup."
616397,davey buoy,2011-08-28 14:48:00,5505,Better pick up some of those. Thanks.
616409,GoneFishin,2011-08-28 15:16:00,349," I don't know where you get your micro ball barring swivels, but the ones I always seem to find not only bend out of shape but, they don't really turn that freely in the first place. So unless your running a heavy line it's not going to help much, but then again heavier line doesn't twist as much in the first place."
616411,vinnimon,2011-08-28 15:29:00,2593,"Out of curiosity, what # line are you guys using as your main line? I like the 8# line. Last year I switched to the raven line, havent had too many issues but I feel its a little limpy for my likings. Mind you I havent soaked it in warm water and it hasnt broken on me on a hook set."
616413,BillM,2011-08-28 15:33:00,17367," Raven Micro XXXS, nothing fancy.  Although with the braid I run, I don't even need a swivel above the float to be honest.  You could always run a slip float and never worry about twist again"
616418,GoneFishin,2011-08-28 15:48:00,349," I've used them but they seem even weaker then black birds but they are a bit smaller so. You said you run braid, how does that hold up, does it float good? And does it help on 20+ yard hooksets? I'm guessing you have another reel with mono for the colder months? I was going to run it on one of my pins before I sold a set up.."
616433,misfish,2011-08-28 16:16:00,29133,"  Those are the ones I use aswell.  Was dowqn again for a few hours. I was getting line twist,so decided to let the line out,put a swivel above and below. Now that I have tried it,I can say it does work.No line twist after a couple of hours.  Still no fish to be seen. Drove over to Angus for a look see and they were getting them.Wont be long til thier up where I was."
616619,BillM,2011-08-29 03:04:00,17367," I use Fireline Crystal, spring/fall/winter/whenever.  Get's a bit stiff in the cold, but nothing crazy.  The long distance hooksets are the best."

618055,strakey,2011-09-02 15:28:00,78,"Well size doesn't matter to much with braid as it is always thinner than mono. What you will have to do is put backing on first than knot it to the braid to fill up the spool otherwise you'll need about 600 yards of braid to fill up the pin. Than after that a swivel and then florocarbon and the other stuff to finish the setup. If your fishing muddy to green than the floro isnt necesary depending on the clarity of the water. I typically use two micro swivels for my setup, which aids in line twist and quick retying from breakoffs. Remember setup is everything for success. Trout are finiky about how it looks in the water.  best of luck    "
616046,davey buoy,2011-08-26 23:39:00,5505,"I know when you side cast a centre pin reel while float fishing you get line twist. Is there anyway to cut that down by the way you set up your line. Right now I have a slide on float, small shot every 6"" or so under float and I tie the hook directly to the line. Maybe I need a swivel or two but would like to know where to put them. I'm really enjoying it,and getting really good distance now.Also I'm using 8LB mono right now.Any help would be appreciated,davey."
616051,Twocoda,2011-08-26 23:55:00,4130,put a swivel above your float.....try to learn a spinning side cast....both will help your cause to a degree
616052,misfish,2011-08-26 23:56:00,29133,I have only started this past spring with the pin. I was shown the side cast and got twists. I was told to put a tiny swival above the float and one below. Im now going to try pulling the line when casting. This will get rid of the twist . So Im told.  PM me when your heading out. We can learn together.
616055,Bill Shearer,2011-08-26 23:59:00,456,"Swivel about two feet above the deepest stretch of water you expect to fish that day will definately solve your problem. Been doing it got a few years now. Still side casting, and I dont have any problems at all."
616056,GoneFishin,2011-08-26 23:59:00,349,"IMO swivels won't help much if at all. People spin there reels while casting to counter the effect of pulling the line off the side. If you get to lazy for that (like me...) then your going to have to deal with line twists here and there. Make sure your split shot are round and try to drag your bait across the water instead of through the water when retrieving. Also if your using roe, take some extra time while tying it to make sure its as round as possible. If your going to use a swivel put it under the float. Make sure you put it low enough to adjust your float."
616057,davey buoy,2011-08-26 23:59:00,5505,"Thanks for the tip,I will try that. Also when it's spinning is that not the walis cast or something different?. At the river last weekend all the fellas I saw were using the side cast and I didn't see anyone spinning it while side casting.How would you do that?"
616062,Twocoda,2011-08-27 00:05:00,4130,"wallis cast is a different animal all together....you tube wallis cast and spinning side cast....if your ""trotting"" youll find the swivel is more effective ABOVE your float (pending on the type of float you use)"
616066,misfish,2011-08-27 00:07:00,29133,"They pull the line from the reel when they cast. Guys like spiel,Solo and BillM  know the terms."

You can google the wallis cast, there are a few good demonstrations, videos etc on the net. Ive gone as far as two. I dont use my float set up as much as I should, or to its fullest potential. What I do for line twists if the room is available, at the end of the drift, I let it sit in the current to unravel itself.

616092,BillM,2011-08-27 01:11:00,17367, Swivels above the float help immensely with line twist.  I take it you've never used one.
616157,davey buoy,2011-08-27 10:36:00,5505,"No Bill I haven't used one,but I will tie one on above the float.I usually have about 6' of line out,so there is not to much room above the float without pulling the swivel through the eye of the rod if your not careful. I'm using a 11'6"" rod.Thanks."
616158,Spiel,2011-08-27 10:47:00,9065," I haven't, never needed one above or below the float, though I also never cast off the side of the reel. I've always used a spinning pull type cast, it's how I learned."
616159,BillM,2011-08-27 10:50:00,17367," See Chris, I'm lazy   This is why I need the swivel!  Although lately both my rigs have been filled with braid..  No line twist even if you are side casting.  Plus the long distance hooksets are a riot!"
616161,Spiel,2011-08-27 10:54:00,9065, Oh those long distance hooksets are the best!  I've never run braid on the center pin Bill so I can't comment on it. In fact these days I'm pretty much limited to a bait cast set up. It's a whole new learning curve but I'm enjoying it.
616162,davey buoy,2011-08-27 11:10:00,5505,"Bill, does the braid work as well as mono?.I use it on my baitcaster and spinning reel.What size braid would you use and in what colour? Thanks"
616163,Spiel,2011-08-27 11:13:00,9065," If memory serves me correctly I believe Bill is using Fireline Crystal, not sure which test?"

616181,BillM,2011-08-27 12:49:00,17367," I run 14lb Fireline Crystal on my setups.  I'll most likely go back to Drennan Super Specialist Mono on my lighter Frogwater rig, but I like that line for my workhorse setup.  To be honest, if you are just starting out, some Trilene XT 10-12lb or even the Raven 12lb (My buddy swears by it) would be a good idea.  I haven't noticed any breakage due to having an extra swivel in my setup either.  You might even wanna check out some Siglon FF.  A bit wirey, but it stays on top and is easy to see.  Really helps with mending and keeping things in line.  You'll eventually realize it's all personal preference   Just don't get caught up in the hype!"
616184,Spiel,2011-08-27 12:55:00,9065,"  I like a wirey type line on my reel, I find it works better for my style of casting as it wants to ""spring"" off the spool as opposed to back winding.  "
616227,troutologist,2011-08-27 15:36:00,951,"Learn the wallis or BC style cast and line twist becomes a non-issue. Though at the end of the day its always a good idea to cut off your rig and let your line out in the current to eilminate any twist there is. This ensures you start your next day, with twist/tangles out and a new rig...always a good practice.  I'm a big fan of the BC cast, after some tweaking of the tension screw on your reel and a bit of practice its great. Though does wear on the shoulder. I still use the side cast if I really want to reach out there, but I find if has the greatest potential to tangle/twist...which results in less time effectively fishing."
616251,Pepe,2011-08-27 18:39:00,21,"I side cast all the time even if I mastered the other casts I still use a side cast and honestly I don't have tons of line twist. Change your line often and like someone said earlier, cut off your rig and let line out in the water to eliminate twist and you'll be good to go. The swivel above the float also helps.  Cheers Pepe"
