617769,Oryx,2011-09-01 14:45:00,186,"so, when I launch.  Do I unhook the boat from the trailer or unhook the trailer from the truck?"
617775,GBW,2011-09-01 14:55:00,8460,well that depends on how well your boat will float with a trailer attached to it...
617782,bigbuck,2011-09-01 15:17:00,2449,"Port Perry (Scubog), Rice Lake, Pigeon Lake, Sturgeon, Chemong etc.. are all within an hour and a half. Don't forget your plug, everyone forgets it once. Don't forget to unplug your trailer lights before you splash the boat. And THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU GO, study the Nav Canada Charts for the body of water you are going to hit to find your spots and to identify the hazards. Hitting a shoal because you were unaware of it is a stupid expensive mistake. Spend a hundred bucks and buy all the proper charts for the lakes you are going to and save hundreds on new props and skeg repairs and possibly a few thousand for a lower end."
617785,lew,2011-09-01 15:24:00,12766, Sounds like you've got ALOT of practicing to do
617888,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-01 22:19:00,130, Hazards? that is why most people recommended Scugog. If he does damage the he may as well sell the boat and buy a peddle boat.
617891,lew,2011-09-01 22:36:00,12766," He wasn't talking about Scugog specifically, he was telling the person to check the charts for whatever body of water he was gonna fish."
617909,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-01 23:57:00,130, So this is a random boating advice thread? Scugog does not need a nautical map. There is maybe one rock in the hole lake and it is not on a nautical map. A basic map is good enough for it and depth finder is a good idea.   Pigeon Lake and taking the Otanabee into Rice lake (and some other kawarthas).....are you guys trying to make the guy afraid of going out a 2nd time? Anyways I think the OP is either going to frenchmans bay or Scugog.
617465,Oryx,2011-08-31 17:57:00,186,So...now that I have this fancy floating machine.  Where are the best places (within 1hr - 1.5 hr of Pickering) to go to for this hobby/lifestyle that we have in common.   thanks
617469,ccmtcanada,2011-08-31 18:09:00,7971,"How big is your new floating machine?  Any of the Kawartha lakes are within that driving range.  The closest likely being Scugog.  Depending on your boating skills and confidence, pick your days as far as wind is concerned and you could hit some bigger bodies of water like Bay of Quinte, Rice Lake (this seems small, but can get nasty quickly), and even Lake Simcoe.  Scugog is only 25 mins from my place, so that's pretty convenient if I only have a few hours of fishing time."
617471,Oryx,2011-08-31 18:12:00,186, Thanks for the quick reply.  It is a 17.5 semi V Aluminum.
617476,Homer Is King,2011-08-31 18:29:00,305,If your only looking to go for a few hours I think Scugog is your best bet. You can launch at the pubic docks in Port Perry.  The public dock in Bewdley on Rice Lake is probably only 45 minutes away. It's another good option.
617479,johnnyb,2011-08-31 18:33:00,3413, I dunno....sounds kinda hairy....
617481,Oryx,2011-08-31 18:34:00,186,"One place I will want to try...weather permitting, would be Just off the Nuke plant.  Frenchman's Bay is 5 mins from my house."
617483,wkrp,2011-08-31 18:37:00,656,The fish have 10 heads at the nuke plant.
617485,ccmtcanada,2011-08-31 18:40:00,7971,LOL
617486,mercman,2011-08-31 18:40:00,7054,  YOU HAVE A GOOD EYE
617487,Oryx,2011-08-31 18:40:00,186,I would get that mounted...
617546,Twocoda,2011-08-31 22:08:00,4130,Congrates on the floating machine....best to winterize it now and hit the rivers...lol...
617557,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-31 23:00:00,130,You must of said some bad things to some people for some of these replies.  Launch at a time when the launches will be quiet. That way you can take your time. Launching for the first time at Port Perry on a Saturday afternoon will not be pleasant.  -pickering and whitby are good places to launch your boat if you just want to go out and come back in 10 minutes and not fish. again...not so great on the weekend and it will cost you for parking ($10?)Whitby parking is good and pickering not so good.  -Port Perry has a very easy launch and good parking $5. There are 2 WIDE ramps and a long dock. Go during a weekday or early on the weekend (sun up and get back before 10am or stay out until 6pm). The lake is almost completely free of hazards and there are fish. I would put this as the #1 pick.  -Bewdley is good and easy too but you will have to walk almost a kilometer to park you car IDK what jack****s came up with that layout.
617564,Oryx,2011-08-31 23:31:00,186,Bad things???  I have been trying to be polite.  (my sense of humour can be a bit caustic) But I do appreciate all of the advice.  Scugog will be a destination point for sure.  Then venture to Bewdley on a following trip.
617566,ccmtcanada,2011-08-31 23:37:00,7971,I don't see any bad replies on here...just people kidding around a bit.  I agree with Scugog...was the place I launched for the first time as well.  I chose the quieter Island Marina...not nearly as busy and the owner helped me launch.  Good luck out there...take some pics and write up a report!
617572,Dave Bailey,2011-08-31 23:58:00,1641,"Since you're in Pickering I would head down to the beach on the west side of Frenchmans Bay and put it in there. You'll have a fair bit of room to practise your launch without getting in the way of other boaters, and the bay is calm and easy to putter around in."
617573,Terry,2011-09-01 00:04:00,14456,"don't see anything bad, there is a bit of humour but it's all fun and games    till someone launches a boat without the plug in"
617579,mercman,2011-09-01 00:15:00,7054,"  Nahhh we're just pullin yer leg. Just remember, boat goes in first"
617581,GBW,2011-09-01 00:19:00,8460,well I'll be home Sunday just before the bit get's good on Scugog so you can pick me up on your way there...
617602,Homer Is King,2011-09-01 00:57:00,305," Ok, OK, Try launch at the pubic boat launch. Launching at the dock WILL get you some funny looks!"
617622,mercman,2011-09-01 01:33:00,7054,"  its not the dock, nor the launch thats gonna be a ""Hair Raising"" experience."
617685,blue pickeral,2011-09-01 10:12:00,267,"Otonabee River. Launch at any of the resorts. There are two marinas close by Peterborough, Bensfort Bridge Resort about half way between Peterborough and Rice Lake.  Not sure about public launches but research Wallace Point. Calm water to start on river, but access to Rice Lake if you want bigger water."
617706,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-01 12:13:00,1022,"Congrats on the new boat! I would recommend going to a launch with limited traffic as its not easy to launch a boat when doing it for the first time. Unless of course you have done it before or have experience towing trailers? It was a nightmare for me the first time. If somebody was recording, I would of been the highlight of youtube  ."
617713,ccmtcanada,2011-09-01 12:22:00,7971," Who does that???  Ok, I did the first time I launched lol.  Good thing the boat was still on the trailer when I realized it! Oops!!!  Thing is, I must have told myself a hundred times not to forget it..."
617738,Oryx,2011-09-01 13:20:00,186,"This forum is great.  Thank you to all..... Now I just need to clear the time with the Boss.   I cannot wait until my 3 yr old takes a serious interest in fishing.....  this way I will not have to hear that age old nag...I mean speech (You are not spending enough time with the family, where are your priorities,)"
