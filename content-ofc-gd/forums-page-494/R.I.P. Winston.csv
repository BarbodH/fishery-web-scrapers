617940,bucktail,2011-09-02 01:16:00,1857,"I want to thank everyone that thought about me and Winston! Winston was a therapy dog with St Johns and was considered one of the best one's they ever had. He was with me thru some bad times. i knew the time was coming and he did too. He waited till I came from work ,into the room at the vet, looked at me and passed away.  We got a new little buddie this spring and they were in seperable, the old guy and the puppie. His name is Loki  You may have seen his dad Munch on the Iam's commercials. He is a pretty awesome awesome puppy thanks to Winston.        I got a bunch of pictures with the 3 amigo's just a few days ago cuz I felt the time was near.         Scottyswing....your right!  Thanks again to everyone, guess I have become one of those crazy dog people.    Darren"

618158,scottyswing,2011-09-03 01:03:00,37,"Aren't Bulldogs the best!?  Lola is 8 months old, and my first Bully. I don't think I'll live a day in my life without one now. Another is soon on his way as i think they are even more fun when they have a friend or two.  So glad to hear Winston went with you near. Always comforting to know you were there till the end. And he was surely grateful for your love.  Lots of happy dog days ahead for you friend"
