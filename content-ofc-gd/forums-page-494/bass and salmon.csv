617304,BFSC Kevin,2011-08-31 03:20:00,1351,"My summer of fishing.   June 27 - July 3 Bassing all began at the start of the season at a small lake up north at a annual cottage trip with friends. Didn't produce many bass over 3 lbs but atleast there were a lot.             dinner   a cool shot   my new boat   a frog having a brew..   the cottage, we'll see you again next year!     July 5.. A few days later, i joined young_one with kelfun fishing for largies early morning...we did well. Here are a few pics but young_one did post a report back then.. one of the first times kelfun really targeted for bass only i think.. now he's hooked! he already bought a ceanan and curado this year.        July 7 I head back to my old stomping ground.. lake x.. in kawarthas.. trying out the livetarget frog and the berkley havoc baits, they worked well and landed me several fish.  a few of my favourite bass baits..   a 19.5"" for team 4   froggy fishing fun            July 10 more fishing  trying out the berkley havoc craw fatty   having success on the pit boss   and of course the senko type worms   July 17 got out with board members kelfun and okuma sheffield it was okuma's first time really targeting for bass i think. definitely his first time going for top water and with good success. he's hooked! he had to run out and buy a curado, lol not many pics but i do have some good action from the go pro. however i didnt edit or upload them..  here were a couple of the largies..    July 23 family camping trip I only stayed for the day to fish. caught a bunch of largies on some new baits and a friend even caught a walleye on topwater. it was my best day of frog fishing yet..  morning topwater live target frog   northam fishing buzzbait   swim senko   flappin' hog    yum air lizard   yum dinger by the gf   pit boss!!!! i like to cut off a bit of the top so that it will be a bit more streamlined   night time topwater   there must be a reason why these frogs are always sold out.....just can't my finger on it... hmm..       and the topwater walleye..    July 27 it was a going to be a windy and hard day of fishing....   buzz bait in the morning   pitboss at noon   30k winds in the afternoon   the ikea bag as drift socks worked great.. just wished i had two.   winds picked up so much, didn't even bother with the trolling motor. just drifted from one side of the lake to the other    it was windy and the docks didn't look so great so we decided to pull out and head over to another lake. I got to use the hummer today, it is great for towing. lol   it was a good decision to try out lake #2 as it yielded the best fish of the day compliments of kelfun   here was a tiny bass caught on a tiny x rap in a tiny covered bay we found..   after 15 hours of fishing in all this wind, we were tired and ready to head home. we didn't even bother with the evening topwater bite. tough day of fishing because of the cold front.  the previous day i did purchase some rod socks from a small local canadian business called cc rod socks(http://www.ccrodsocks.com/). they work just great. for $6-7 a piece, they are better priced than any other ones i've seen out there. i purchased 6 myself and would recommend them to any others. btw i found out about them from young_one. pictured below are the socks, with a couple of shimano ones and rapala cloth ones.   July 30 I had the pleasure of attending the 2011 king of kings tightline shootout as an observer. it was a great learning experience for me to see how that tournament was ran and how to target for those kings. unfortunately for brent, the captain of the boat i was in, didn't land any kings. Landed just 1 bow, lost 1 screamer and lost one at boatside. no pictures from the fishing, i did try to get some video on go pro but that didn't happen.. lol   because of this event, i knew i had to finally install the riggers on my boat so i can target some lake o fish. in addition, i knew i was missing some vital gear...   August - salmon fishing.  if some may recall, i posted on the board asking how i should install my riggers. after thinking about it for half a year, i decided to use a board. I was eager to downrig, so it didn't have as much support as i would like it to...  the board is made of a 1 x 6 oak wood, spanning from gunwale to gunwale, being kept down by the bolted cleats  Trip #1 On my first trip out, i went out solo with some equipment and knowledge. I was able to hook into a decent bow and get it to boat side but was it able to free itself because i was only using my small general purpose net... I figured I was missing a big net and a subtroll/fish hawk...   Ran over to radio world because they were selling the fish hawk for 599 in the afternoon   Installed it that evening   Also grabbed a stowmaster from someone on another board.  trip #2 another solo trip I beefed up my transom board by adding a post into the seat base and adding a 1/8"" alumnium plate under the board at the cleat to the downrigger. Plenty sturdy now - i can even sit on it and use it as a bench.   this was a more successful trip and i was actually able to land some fish solo with this new big net.   a fish for team 4   Several trips...undated trolling along   very annoying to see this...!   didn't take many pics because i was fishing solo most of the time for the GOSD and didn't catch anything really notable.    a pretty fat one     foggy morning at the bluffs    here is a video with my iphone on the day that i was sea sick for the first time... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2Bbuf6FUG0   i'm about done for trolling for kings this year but i'll probably still head out a few times for bows, browns and maybe some staging kings.  i would like to thank a few guys here for getting me into big lake trolling... Shawn aka fishindevil for introducing me into trolling back at boq for eyes Dan aka Percher with introducing me to downrigging and giving me great tips and tricks! Ryan aka troutguy of www.wepoundemfishing.com for hooking me up with some awesome gear and tackle.. and great tips aswell. thanks guys  I'll be sure to get ready to troll next year early for those kings and land me a tyee!"
617305,BFSC Kevin,2011-08-31 03:20:00,1351,since it seems that im allowed to only post one video per post... here is another one a fish that got away.. it was the toyota matrix that got away! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roReYVaNpzY&feature=channel_video_title
617307,BFSC Kevin,2011-08-31 03:21:00,1351,"heres one when i was fishing right before the thunderstorm rolled in.. caught this fish before i got shocked while reeling in the leadcore and ran back.. and victor i was using the ipilot to steer the boat, not checking my phone http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1LJ9e9Hwtw&feature=channel_video_title I guess i could've tried to revive it in the water but my brother's gf was happy to get the fish."

617318,Victor,2011-08-31 04:16:00,1609,sounds like you've got this downrigging business down within like a month!  we still need to go out for some carp with your new baitrunner and maybe you can take me out for some kings next year
