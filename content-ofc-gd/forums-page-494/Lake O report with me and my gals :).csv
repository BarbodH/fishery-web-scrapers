Starting off for the long weekend on the water I couldnt ask for anything more. esp meeting up with a friend  and his boy out there  We started out at 90fow 2 lead cores and 2 on on the riggers, right away the rods are dancing  Then when reeling in nothing was to show for blasted fish At this point it happened 4 times and I promised my gals fish, yes fish for them to land Rod went up and guess what, I turned to my youngest and said reel it in Again another rod goes off, if passed it off to my oldest , she faught and faught only to lose it to the side of the boat, oh well. things happen. We eventually managed to hook 2 more that were landed afterwards. Nothing spectacular but they all faught with a fury My Girls included What a great start to the weekend, everyone catching fish etc, and esp seeing spincast and gman out there on the water   "

618273,spincast,2011-09-03 23:03:00,3279,"Those were 2 very happy gals I met today at the launch Vince, way to go.   Ours were pretty small too - 5 knock offs, 6 in the boat - all pretty small     Big hooks on the screen but none of them wanted to play today The weather and sunrise however were fantastic!       That was definitely one of the flattest days on the water this year.     Awesome way to start a 3 day break"
