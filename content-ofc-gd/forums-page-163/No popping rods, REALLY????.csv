928405,misfish,2015-08-08 16:28:00,29133," I was going to say the same thing but opted not to!!    You are a good man Terry.  I see the problem.. in the second picture!!  Luv yah Terry...  With friends like you guys, he dont need no enemies. LOL"
928406,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-08 17:04:00,8243,"When I see a screen like that is when I reach in my bag of tricks for a fresh C.I.L. wobbler. Or I will pop the line off the downriggers and let the bait flutter around, sink , float whatever. Just do something different because whatever I was doing those hooks weren't interested. Sometimes pull the lines and add a worm to the  centre treble or the hook on a spoon. Sometimes it works sometimes nothing does short of an exploding CIL wobbler. I feel your pain Bri."
928407,misfish,2015-08-08 17:11:00,29133," Always doing this Johnny. ( use of electric riggers makes it much easier ) It,s also done everytime we switch up lures. Never reel in til it,s climbed from the depths."
928295,misfish,2015-08-07 18:51:00,29133,Rods wouldnt pop. How could that be. MY GAWD.      Told ya it was quick.  Felt great to get out on the water to just chillax with me bud.

928313,fishnsled,2015-08-07 21:02:00,3520,"Giving what you've been through recently you deserved to move a few rods with a picture like that Brian.  Oh well, at least you were on the water and enjoying the day with a good bud.  You'll get them next time out."
928315,misfish,2015-08-07 21:12:00,29133,"Giving what you've been through recently you deserved to move a few rods with a picture like that Brian.  Oh well, at least you were on the water and enjoying the day with a good bud.  You'll get them next time out.  Thanks Wil. I even mentioned to Terry how much pleasure I had just sitting back and enjoying the time on the water. I was never so relaxed as I was . There was no need to catch. ( although we were yelling at the screen ) LOL  I JUST ENJOYED THE MORNING OUT WITH A GOOD FRIEND AND WAS VERY THANKFULL."

928317,Terry,2015-08-07 21:16:00,14456,it was good to bet out fishing with you today  but all those fish with no biter drove me crazy
928332,chris.brock,2015-08-07 22:49:00,4053,Try a big treble hook Bri and troll fast
928339,spincast,2015-08-07 23:08:00,3279,winds from the east?  - as Joey says  Damn you suspended fish!
928340,kickingfrog,2015-08-07 23:16:00,8333,"Geez, I get a couple of hooks that don't bite and I start talkin' to the screen."
928342,misfish,2015-08-07 23:29:00,29133,winds from the east?  - as Joey says  Damn you suspended fish!  Breeze was from the west at start up. The went still. That was hot. Then a slight breeze from the south/east by noon. Nothing that should of shut them down. Not that it mattered. I only brought my rigger rod.  I wasnt  going to be casting today. Im waiting for the all clear next monday to get back into the swing of things. It will be slow Im sure. Im scared sh%^# to even reef on a fish right now.  The boat ride was much nicer then sitting on the shore banks watching goby catchers.LOL
928343,misfish,2015-08-07 23:33:00,29133,"Try a big treble hook Bri and troll fast  Im not confessing we tried this Chris, but we did burp,pump, up the speed to see if they wanted a fast bait to chase."
928344,misfish,2015-08-07 23:34:00,29133,"Geez, I get a couple of hooks that don't bite and I start talkin' to the screen.  Rob  I cant wait to get out and not worry about whats on the screen. Slinnging spinner baits and tubes soon I hope."
928345,misfish,2015-08-07 23:36:00,29133,crazy   I have no comment.

928362,Canuck2fan,2015-08-08 01:32:00,1444,"Thus the name fish FINDER, not fish catcher.  Sometimes we sit on the pier and go I wonder what we would see out there with some sonar... Are there fish and they just have lock jaw or are we alone. After seeing this sometimes ignorance is bliss. I would be fuming seeing a screen like that with no takers. LOL"
