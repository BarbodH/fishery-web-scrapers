928619,OhioFisherman,2015-08-10 02:16:00,6623,"I think it has something to do with Lake Ontario being a much deeper lake, it might not get as much chop to the waves."
928622,DRIFTER_016,2015-08-10 02:20:00,10439,"Yep, deeper lake equals smoother chop."
928623,Gallie,2015-08-10 02:21:00,1215,"Honestly i think that you got a nice day, i have seen some downright nasty chop on lake ontario. This sat was the first where id had seen rollers on lo in the 8-9 times ive been down, a couple of my past trips it was pretty rough."
928624,kickingfrog,2015-08-10 02:38:00,8333,"Yep big and shallow. Nipissing, Lake Winnipeg etc. Any water can get nasty in a hurry but big and shallow just adds to it."
928641,Freshtrax,2015-08-10 05:43:00,2215,Depending on where you are in the lake makes a difference... 2 footers off bronte are a nightmare with 20 mph west wind... 2 footers off bronte with 6 mph east wind. Much different they have time to space out.
928650,dave524,2015-08-10 12:06:00,4508,"Three footers when the waves are building are far nastier than 3 footers when the waves are diminishing. Gone out many times both lakes after a good blow the previous day and found big swells but spaced way far apart after the winds diminished, at those times 3/4 footers are a non issue. Lake Erie being shallower blows up a bit faster but lays down quicker after a good blow."
928690,landry,2015-08-10 15:23:00,1005,I find Erie and St clair waves to be more spread out and therefore harder to get on top of with my 16' boat.
