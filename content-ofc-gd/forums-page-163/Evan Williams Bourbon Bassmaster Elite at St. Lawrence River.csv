The primary diet of round gobies includes mollusks, crustaceans, worms, fish eggs, zebra mussels, small fish, and insect larvae. ""  I can picture them being a problem during the spawn, but I am not sure how much  afterwards, it seems like a zebra mussel would be easier to catch for food?  "" I saw the pros bouncing all over the place like ping pong balls.  A few of them stuck to the same spot all four days, but most of them were running and gunning looking for bites.""  That was the norm even on our lakes here, and most are under 3000 acres.  Just my experience here on Lake Erie for smallies, a spot can be dead for 5-6 hours and then in 15-30 minutes you can catch a limit of hogs and then it goes dead again. For me the best time of the day for smallies on Lake Erie was between 2-5pm, LOL it meant a late start didn't hurt."
927753,misfish,2015-08-04 22:45:00,29133,"Heres one for ya Paul.  There was the 1000 islands tourny on the same river, same weekend Canadian side.  The winner caught 73.79 pounds. A new 3 day record  His winnings, $15,000.  Winner on the other sides 3 day catch would have put him in 9th for the 1000 Island Open."
927755,OhioFisherman,2015-08-04 22:55:00,6623,"Brian, I think they were allowed to fish both sides of the river, but it seems to me someone mentioned they had to contact someone when they crossed over? No idea if that involved any down time or inspections. I can't really picture them guys wanting to sit around waiting or go out of their way to be inspected?  LOL, of course the fishing is better on the Canadian side, it's probably cleaner!"
927756,misfish,2015-08-04 22:57:00,29133,"LOL Ya cleaner and less flow. NOT  Brian, I think they were allowed to fish both sides of the river, but it seems to me someone mentioned they had to contact someone when they crossed over?  When I fished Erie, just needed a us lic. No asking. Maybe cuz it was pre 911. Amazing how that day really screwed with our countries."
927757,manitoubass2,2015-08-04 23:12:00,11391,"To be honest I think alot of the southern pros have way less practise fishing heavy current.  Its not easy to do.  Sure as mentioned you can position the boat and use your motor to drop shot deeper areas,but it takes a whole new skill set to fish shallow smallies and control the speed and presentation.  Add the chop and muddy windswept water and its tough.  If your not used to those conditions your gonna get your butt kicked.  Im positive I would have been slow rolling heavy black spinner baits with silver blades.  Easiest bait to change speed, fish shallow mid range or deep, relatively snagless and you can fish the current all ways."
927758,OhioFisherman,2015-08-04 23:13:00,6623,"Yes, I am sure it hurt the tourism and travel industry. I know people with kids that no longer go to Ontario, they just can't justify the added expense and or hassles involved in getting passports for the family.  I used to make a few long weekend trips to the Canadian side of the falls when I was younger and my kids were young, most young families can't afford to do that now?  But our southern border still seems wide open?"

I have seen some of those southern boys fishing tournaments where there are hydro dams, when they increase the water flow it seemed to trigger a feeding frenzy, but of course it wasn't constant 24/7 like he larry.  Also read stories about Billy Westmoreland smallie fishing, different down there than here too, but he made it work."
927850,MrSimon,2015-08-05 12:28:00,217,"I fished both the US and Canadian side of the river.  You have to have an Ontario license and card and make about a 30 second phone call before entering Canadian water.  They ask you a few basic questions about your boat and intentions, then say good luck and have fun.  If you plan on pulling on shore, it's a whole different story and you have to visit a check in station.  What I took away from rubbing shoulders with the pros for a few days is just how good they really are.  A lot of folks think that if they had the same boat and gear as the pros, they could be as successful.  It just ain't true.  There are sooooo many little details that have to be dialed in just right to do well at that level it's mind boggling."

927875,OhioFisherman,2015-08-05 14:22:00,6623,"Like Steve, I think that might have been the big difference? Fighting that constant current has to expend a lot more energy, and I can guess it would affect smallies that tend to frequent a different type of water than largemouth more.  6+ plus largemouth were the big fish the first two days, just guessing that they came from areas with little or no current?"

I'm sure your're right.  I think it would take me an entire summer of fishing every day on that river to figure things out enough to catch 17+ pounds for four days in a row.  Heck, maybe two or three summers.  Especially if I had to be off the water by mid afternoon and never fish the evening bite, like the pros."

927891,manitoubass2,2015-08-05 15:22:00,11391,"This is true.  It took me 5 years to figure out all the patterns on my home river.  Its insane that these guys travel non stop, fish unknown waters and can still put good fish in the boat.  Imagine the amount of knowledge in the heads of the top guys???  Their like 20 levels ahead of your average bass nut im sure.  I fished a small walleye tourny on my home river 3 or so years ago and i won. 2 pros showed up and were just baffled.  After the tourny i was talking with them and the knowledge they had was just insane.  After I explained what I was doing he was like ""man, i had thought about that last night but changed my plan at the last minute""  We went out together the next day so I could show him exactly what I had done and to be honest I wanted to see things on his electonics.  We anchored in 17 fow on the outside of a current seam and casted big 7"" leeches into the current on jigs and let them drift into 4fow and bam! We hammered a few 6 and 7 lbers. It was awesome  Then hes like hey, lets troll cranks right through that 4fow and i bet will hammer em.  Sure enough. Now hes landing fish on every pass and there all 7-8lbers.  I always knew those big walleye can be had shallow, but that was the first time i trolled 10 foot diving cranks in 4fow and its a technique i use alot now and the river.  About a year later keith kaveitz(sp) had a seminar on the exact same technique(the vid is on youtube) and he trolls right into 2-3fow  Its a cool technique you dont see often"

927997,misfish,2015-08-05 22:34:00,29133,I asked an angler that was in the Canadian tourny. Seems the big pond was out of bounds. So all three tournys were on the larry.
928103,charlesn,2015-08-06 14:02:00,551,"Brian, The CBAF event was the one that was restricted to the river.  The Renegade boys definitely made the run to the lake.  Some even ran to the Ducks in that stuff.  I give them credit for big brass stones.  Even if it was open for me I would not have gone.  Just too much of a beating on my gear and old man body.  I guess it makes a difference when you actually have to pay for your rig.  lol  The biggest difference in the weights between Elites and Renegade is the Lake being open - but take nothing away from the top finishers in the 1000 Island Open, some of them could definitely hang with anyone on the planet on that body of water.  The other difference in the weights is that the Elites fish solo - WITHOUT A NET!  I don't know about you - but having a net has definitely saved my ass a few times with lightly hooked smallies or largies.  And in a team event, 2 baits cover twice as much water and working as a team is simply a bunch more efficient (not to mention a net man) than going it alone. The CBAF event was a true draw meaning the two people in the boat fished against each other which adds complications and strategical implications all on it's own.  We don't normally think about ""defense"" in fishing.  lol  But in one particular boat in the CBAF event (the one I was in for the grassroots non pro level angler) the boater had 19.5ish and the non had well over 22.  You can imagine if they combined their best 5 it would be upwards of 25.  I think I would've need my best 10 fish to come close.  lol  I don't have a ton of experience in the river but thought I knew enough to hold my own.  I was WRONG.  Bad assumptions, a weak practice and terrible execution caused me to do terrible.  But learned a ton and like the area even more than I did before even though it kicked me in the stones 4 days in a row.  Really beautiful water body - so diverse and stretches on forever and ever.  Charles"
928126,misfish,2015-08-06 15:44:00,29133,"I had to re read. Yes your are correct. ME BAD  Thanks Charles and very nice to hear from you. So you are back fishing again? Kids all grown up?   As far as nets go, I still laugh about our time on Rice."
928137,Garnet,2015-08-06 17:05:00,2056,"I watched some of the live footage. Looked like Edwin was hitting little 2ndary pt likely main land, firing the bait up current and letting it swing around the pt.  He likely hit a 100. You would need to be in great shape getting up and down that many times.  I lost the elite series dream quick, couldn't spend that much time on the road."
928146,charlesn,2015-08-06 18:32:00,551,Kids are still little Brian but a man's gotta fish right - tourneys are in my blood!  The 8 year old has done 2 tourneys and the 7 year old just did her first.  Trying to get them hooked early. Results weren't great but nevertheless had a blast and already talking about the next ones.  I just wish there were three person events so I could take both at once.  Getting the itch to do a major pro/am again though...  Maybe Erie this fall.  Will see how the rest of the summer goes. You should come down and insult Andy and maybe Palotta will stick you with me as a punishment...  I'm better on Erie than Rice - I promise - uh kinda maybe?!  Hope all is well with you.
927166,OhioFisherman,2015-08-01 20:34:00,6623,"I am just guessing that most of those largemouth came from back bays and areas sheltered from the current, they aren't dumb enough to fight that current full time. LOL"

I can't imagine trying to do the same in a 100 or so mile long area.  LOL, there has to be a million spots that look good? Modern electronics has sure made their jobs easier?  The hot lure for Muskie on the St.  Lawrence next week might be a struggling smallmouth finish?"

927479,manitoubass2,2015-08-03 14:51:00,11391,As a bass angler i will target shallow water in almost any lake for smallies.
927487,OhioFisherman,2015-08-03 15:27:00,6623,"The difference in fisheries manitou? I saw an article and pictures last week of snow that had been piled up from last winter in parts of New York still melting. I heard a couple of the anglers involved in that tournament make references to the concept that the spawn had just finished and the smallies hadn't moved en mass to deeper water?  I only fished a couple of lakes in extreme western New York, and both seemed to have a summer climate a lot closer to Ontario's than us. Once summer hits here smallies shallow seem an oddity, I have caught more walleye casting to rocky areas of the lake Erie islands mid summer than smallies."
927684,MrSimon,2015-08-04 17:53:00,217,"I was up on the river for three days during the tournament.  It was neat to see the pros buzzing around and I got to fish the same shoal as a few of them for a while.  I couldn't tell who they were though.  I totally agree with the general consensus of the pros that the smallies were spread out, sluggish, hard to find .... but big.  I caught three four pounders, a couple of 2.5 pounders, and a 27"" walleye, but that was it.  No small ones and they sure as heck weren't bunched up anywhere I could find.  Frankly, it was really tough fishing.  The heavy wind and strong current aren't easy to deal with.  It's also such a dang big river that it feels like finding a needle in a haystack.  It sure is a beautiful place to fish though!  There were a couple of nasty thunder storms that rolled through in the evenings.  PS - I did spend one day fishing over on Black Lake.  It's night and day different from the River and I had a ball.  I caught a bunch of perch, a half dozen nice bass, and about six million bluegill and sunfish.  It was such a breath of fresh air to not fight current all day."
927697,OhioFisherman,2015-08-04 18:41:00,6623,"Mr. Simon, was it your first time there? I wondered how much time some of them spent fishing areas sheltered from the wind and current? It's probably a given for the guys that were fishing for largemouth, but sheltered areas off islands and points on the river.  They are pros, some probably had to try them?"
927702,manitoubass2,2015-08-04 18:48:00,11391,"Yeah different water bodies for sure. But one thing ive found consistant in current is smallies can almost alway be found shallow, especially in river systems.  But these guys know a f of alot more about bass then me lol,thats for certain.  Presentation in current takes alot of practice."
927718,MrSimon,2015-08-04 19:37:00,217,"Mr. Simon, was it your first time there? I wondered how much time some of them spent fishing areas sheltered from the wind and current? It's probably a given for the guys that were fishing for largemouth, but sheltered areas off islands and points on the river.  They are pros, some probably had to try them?  No, I've fished that area a number of times.  I found the best way to fish in current is to point the boat into the current and use the trolling motor to slow the drift down enough that you can fish vertical with a drop shot while drifting with the current.  It's a pretty effective way to cover water and stay on good structure.  Strong winds really test your batteries, but it works.  The vast majority of the pros were most definitely fishing for smallies.  The fish were spread out more than I've seen in the past.  Shallow to deep ... rocks to weeds ... current to slack water .... and everywhere in between.   They just weren't using any particular pattern, which made it really hard to find them in numbers.  I saw the pros bouncing all over the place like ping pong balls.  A few of them stuck to the same spot all four days, but most of them were running and gunning looking for bites.  Everyone always talks about how deep you have to fish on the St. Lawrence .... some guys even talk about catching bass and walleye in 100 FOW in the shipping channel.  They say things like, ""the fish have gone deep to get away from the gobbies"".  I don't know, maybe that's true .... but all my fish came in 15-30 FOW, including the nice walleye and a ton of perch.  Honestly, I think the fishing on the SLR is going to keep getting worse.  Sure the gobies are a great food source for big bass and walleye, but they eat all the baby fish.  No baby fish means no big fish down the road."

927148,OhioFisherman,2015-08-01 19:17:00,6623,"Brian, I watched a couple of hours of the live feed, the two guys they were focused on were definitely smallie fishing. A lot of follows but not many bites between 12:00 and 2PM or so. I think both were a long way from the ramp, an hour or so?  No clue, that would sort of be an entirely new deal for me fishing in that type of constant current, I think someone mentioned it was 5mph?  Lake Erie and most lakes here can get a bit windy, but we don't have anything with a constant current like that. Even one of our area rivers wasn't bad unless there was a heavy rain, but it is nothing like that river.  I have seen the Niagara from Ft.Erie to the Falls, I can picture that being challenging also to fish."

927160,misfish,2015-08-01 20:16:00,29133,I realy like when I see guys showing a mix bag. They can do both if need be. Dont get stuck on one fish.
