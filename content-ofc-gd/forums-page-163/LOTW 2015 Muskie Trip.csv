928298,SylvanOwner,2015-08-07 19:07:00,266,"Doesn't look windy/wavy to me..... .....what's the problem?  Great fish!  Very jealous!  Just hearing someone say ""Lake of the Woods"" has given me goosebumps since I was a kid.  Saw the lake for the first time last month as I was driving to BC.  ""Blue lake and rocky shore.  I will return once more...."""
928303,mepps,2015-08-07 20:10:00,1301,"Great stuff Pete, thats a lot of muskie in the boat!"
928304,fishnsled,2015-08-07 20:13:00,3520,This would be the reason to get back up there.  That's an impressive haul for the trip!  Good going gents!
928327,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-07 22:16:00,8243,"You two caught more ""fish of a thousand casts"" in one trip than most in a lifetime. Your  fingers must be worn to the bone with 15,000 casts or so. 2 thumbs up. This site needs a ""AWESOME"" button."
928398,Lunkerhunter,2015-08-08 14:20:00,455,"I am sure pete will chime in but yes the hands and fingers needed a break after that trip.  We have stayed at witch bay camp before. It's prob my favourite of them all so far. lots of awesome fishing close to camp as well.  As far as structure goes we started the week fishing main lake structure such as rocky points, reefs and island saddles. After the craZy winds we switched gears to weedy bays with beaches.  I find the type of rock your fishing makes all the difference up there. You want the chunky stuff. Nothing smooth. Or at least a combination of the two.  Just firmed up my next trip on LOTW for end of October. Can't wait"
928399,Lunkerhunter,2015-08-08 14:23:00,455,Sadly no big Walters this year. We were hoping sandy would have helped us find a walleye spot close to camp for the odd afternoon or evening when we wanted a break. Unfortunately no help was provided so we attempted a few spots with no luck so said screw it and kept muskie fishing haha
928410,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-08 17:47:00,8243,"Every time I go and enter a fish for our team someone else, usually you 2 guys, has beat me to it with a bigger fish. How can Team 5 possibly lose with you 2 on the team? Hooorahhh."
928411,captpierre,2015-08-08 20:22:00,2521,Looks like about a football field length of Skis. Well done.
928443,fishindevil,2015-08-08 23:10:00,6254,Wow !!! Awesome trip guys some very nice toothy critters for sure !!!!
928497,mike rousseau,2015-08-09 08:24:00,4661,What no 5-0s  You guys suck.... Lmao...  Looks like a blast... Those fish look pristine
928535,manitoubass2,2015-08-09 14:32:00,11391,"Never lost a lower end and caught monster muskies lol, thats a great time at LOTWs   For those that dont know, LOTWs is insane to boat through."
928561,tomkat,2015-08-09 16:52:00,246,Always wanted to go there my old tackle box made it before me. I see it in your boat haha
928805,Fisherpete,2015-08-10 21:23:00,1814,"Yes the giant Lakewoods box serves me well! Thanks again for a great deal.  As Andrew mentioned, of the various lodges that we have stayed at, Witch Bay was by far the best overall experience. Anyone interested in more info on our experiences at any of the lodges please feel free to PM either of us.  Here's a couple more pics that I just got back, two of my favourite shots from the trip actually! Andrew with a 42.5"" and me with a 43"". You can really see the shoulders on the fish up there in these two images.    "
928841,Handlebarz,2015-08-10 23:11:00,3790,Awesome report and great trip guys I bet you would have had a blast with John Tim and the other Boys from Chicago it's hard not to. We got to meet a couple others last winter Brian and I forget the others great people always look forward to your trip reports.
928022,Fisherpete,2015-08-05 23:33:00,1814,"I'm still pretty tired from the 23 hour drive back, so not much in the storytelling department this time... but here are the highlights and lowlights.  Here's the pics.                                                  "
928023,2 tone z71,2015-08-05 23:38:00,1311,Sweet pics..nicely done ..what lodge ? Planning a trip
928026,Rich Clemens,2015-08-05 23:55:00,3131,Crap ....  Any fish left in there LOL.    Congrats guys.
928032,bigbuck,2015-08-06 00:25:00,2449,Nice Job!! I have just started planning a trip up there for next summer. We're doing the north east angle of the lake. Getting pumped and it is a year away.
928036,PUMP KNOWS,2015-08-06 00:45:00,937,Thats insane!  Thanks for sharing
928053,Lunkerhunter,2015-08-06 01:16:00,455,Lol pete awesome trip again dude. Once again I apologize for the cursing on the way home in waves that were half the size of my boat.  Haha damn those were crazy. I still feel bad sorry brother. You didn't mention we were 50 km from the lodge when we called it quits and decided to drive back to the lodge.  John (cowanjo) put together a great group of guys and it was cool to share stories with so many lake of the woods veterans.  And yes pete it's funny when we explored new water we got the biggest fish of the trip. The fish didn't like the big winds either and were thinking like us looking for protection in the weeds and bays.  We stayed at Sandys blackhawk island. Cabins were nice but it was a pain in the butt to get to from kenora compared to other lodges on the lake. Also the help we recieved if any from the lodge was sub par at best but we were all pretty self sufficient thankfully so we figured it out.  Can't wait until next years lake of the woods adventure.
928054,Gallie,2015-08-06 01:34:00,1215,"That looks awesome, guess i gotta plan a lotw trip now too. Sweet fish fellas"
928055,Jds63,2015-08-06 01:44:00,1365,Those some great looking fish !!!!
928057,Sinker,2015-08-06 01:49:00,8692,"Good times boys! Nice fish, and sounds like an awesome adventure!  S."
928070,Joey,2015-08-06 03:57:00,9122,"Holy Shmoly, Nice job Pete !!!!!"
928077,FrankTheRabbit,2015-08-06 06:23:00,479,"Wow! Amazing trip, amazing snaps! Good job!"
928078,Reel Man,2015-08-06 06:30:00,80,Beauty fish guys!  Glad you were able to survive the elements and use it to your advantage.  Congrats on the PB!
928086,solopaddler,2015-08-06 11:37:00,8605,"Those are some pretty great highlights, wow! I'd love to hear what type of structure you fellas targetted.  Cheers"
928088,NAW,2015-08-06 12:09:00,4022,That's an amazing report!!
928098,misfish,2015-08-06 13:22:00,29133,Thats some real nice fish there guys.  Thanks  for the report.
928107,AKRISONER,2015-08-06 14:21:00,5558,"these guys catch skies...enough said  great pics, fave fish is still that big old pike."
928124,Acountdeleted,2015-08-06 15:41:00,2562,Great catches Pete. Glad everyone returned safe and sound. Those white knuckle boat rides can get scary.
928132,manjo39,2015-08-06 16:23:00,354,Pete told me you were going and was anticipating the report.  Congrats on a great trip and thanks for the report Pete and Andrew.
928206,bigbuck,2015-08-07 00:30:00,2449,Smith Camps if you want to be near Kenora. 25 minutes from town. Tons of great water up there. The place is decent and very well kept. I am planni g on staying there next summer. Witch Bay camps is supposed to be good too but they are waay out.
928208,grimsbylander,2015-08-07 00:33:00,3016,"Great work guys! Given the conditions, you guys did amazing. Thanks for posting the pics."
928212,Joeytier,2015-08-07 00:54:00,3990,Awesome stuff.  Nice to be able to nail big pike while musky fishing
928227,manitoubass2,2015-08-07 03:23:00,11391,I dont know those spots by the pics but I can bet I know what structure your targeting!  Ah the from mid july to middle of august is a great time indeed?  Wicked report! Great fish!  My fav is also the pike.  Any incidental big walters???  Awesome report!
928229,cram,2015-08-07 03:26:00,1733,Awesome fish dude.  You sure know how to do it up.  (was kidding about the pics - I have never been to and will likely never make it to LOTW).
928231,manitoubass2,2015-08-07 03:29:00,11391,^^^  This report shows why EVERYONE should add LOTWs to the bucket list.
928233,JoshS,2015-08-07 03:34:00,729,Awesome that you guys get out there once a year. That's one hell of a tow. Nice work on the fish!
