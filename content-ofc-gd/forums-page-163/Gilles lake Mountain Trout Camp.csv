I never did get out fishing though, it was just too windy to bother renting a boat.  It's a nice little lake and the whole area has a lot of things to see.  We drove up to the historical lighthouse - that was an interesting road to drive on.       I'll check to see if I have a depth map for you.  Good luck!  edit: Gillies Lake Map (Scroll down to the bottom of the page and open the Other Lakes tab)"
926837,leaf4,2015-07-30 21:21:00,2466,"Thanks for the links OhioFisherman! But I was referring to the fishing haha, hopefully we can catch a few eater trout for a lunch or dinner  Also thanks for the map, hopefully I can find some deeper water if that's where they're marking at... Maybe I should bring my little down rigger haha"
926844,leaf4,2015-07-30 22:31:00,2466,  Rigged up my seats... Cruising in comfort now haha
927641,leaf4,2015-08-04 15:37:00,2466,"Got back into Hamilton yesterday around 7 just before the next downpour, ended up getting a bit of fishing done with just a couple 1lb bass to show for, should've brought my gas 4hp for the canoe as it was waaaayyy too windy to try and get up to the bass hole we found Friday that seemed to produce... But I also should've brought my anchor so we could stop there and cast in. The area was great and the staff/accommodations were top notch I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a full service campground especially those with kids as the swimming area was awesome! It had a jungle gym/slide/water trampoline setup that everyone had fun on"
927685,Gerritt,2015-08-04 17:56:00,6129,Sounds like a good time man! I'm gonna have a look at this place. As I need a getaway!  G   Edit to add.... Damn that looks like East 14th st
927740,leaf4,2015-08-04 21:51:00,2466,"Lol you're actually not far off!  If you do go, and have a downrigger setup I would suggest bringing it as a couple of the seasonals pulled in a few trout trolling about the deepest basin, but its a great place to just relax; no cell service haha"
