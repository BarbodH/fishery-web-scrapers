927849,doubleheader,2015-08-05 12:17:00,497,"Cliff,  I would urge you to consider attending the Hershey Park, PA show in September. It's the biggest RV show in North America and nearly every brand and style will be on display. You can get in them, see what features you like, ask questions, meet dealers, get literature, and really start down the road of making an informed decision. If you go you really need to stay at least 2 days. You will learn more about RV's there in 2 days than you will in a year going to individual dealers, and you'll have fun to boot.  My wife and I went last year and are attending again this year. It's an amazing show."
927987,Big Cliff,2015-08-05 21:49:00,6899,"That sounds like it would be a really good way to go! Brings up a whole lot of other questions to ask though like importing them into Canada, warranty, I think we have pretty much decided that we would want to start off with a gently used one so that we don't end up loosing 30% of our investment if we find out 6 months down the road it isn't quite what we thought it was. Do they also feature used ones at the show?"

We are cottage type people, don't have marble floors or leather furnature at home now so it wouldn't be a big priority for a motor home. Many of the ones I have looked at so far have 3+ TV sets even ones outside, there is two of usand when we do watch TV it is usually together. A lot of these seem to have ""LUXURY"" in mind and quality is secondary. I'm looking for something functional, comfortable, reliable, and affordable. Short list, hard to find!"
928087,doubleheader,2015-08-06 12:08:00,497,"They don't bring used units to that show Cliff, but I like your thinking relative to buying used. If it were up to me I'd buy used but my wife prefers new so you know the old saying, ""happy wife, happy life"". No, the real reason to attend the show is to just learn. Learn about the pros and cons of each type of RV from travel trailer to 5th wheel to coach. Even though we're planning to buy new it is every unlikely we'd buy at a show.  Best of luck to you, but as an fyi, my retired friends say Florida has the best deals ever on used campers.  That makes sense if you think about all the folks hauling them down there."

928287,bigbuck,2015-08-07 16:47:00,2449,That sounds pretty good. As long as it runs well and everything works. It should be good. Make sure you get some sort of a warranty on it.

Something with that low mileage is always suspect as far as why? This is through a dealer so I would insist on a full inspection with a detailed report and some sort of warranty. I did crunch some numbers and a unit that old with average milage on it (a lot lower than a car) should be selling in around $75,000.00 The asking for this is quite a bit higher but if it is in fact in mint condition like they are telling me then it might be worth the extra.  That sounds pretty good. As long as it runs well and everything works. It should be good. Make sure you get some sort of a warranty on it. That powertrain is not even broken in.

928396,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-08 14:03:00,8243,"I  might think about paying someone that works on these things as an independent inspector. A seal might look like it might be good for 90 days and it would pass their inspection but it might not be good for much longer than that. I would ask for a heck more warranty than 90 days Cliff, at least 6 months."
925395,MrSimon,2015-07-20 12:30:00,217,"It's really all about preference and what you plan to do.  My personal recommendation based on your situation is to go with the fifth wheel and a nice 3/4 ton diesel truck.  It sounds like you'll want to camp in different spots for decent chunks of time - not bouncing around every week or so.  The big campers are a LOT cheaper than big motor homes, and they are larger inside and have better layouts (no cab area to eat up space).  A nice diesel pickup will hold its value really well, and the campers hold value better than motorhomes (from my experience).  One thing for sure, you can save a TON of money by buying both the truck and camper a few years old.  There is no reason to buy brand new.  Lastly, if its just the two of you, you should at least look at the big bumper pull campers.  Some of the newer ones have two or three slideouts and are super nice.  They will be cheaper than a big fifth wheel and will be easier to tow around and sell later.  Plus, it frees up the bed of your truck, which is incredibly useful."
925396,BillM,2015-07-20 12:32:00,17367,"I'd get a nice comfy Sprinter conversion van and be done with it.  Big enough for two people, can tow a boat, good fuel mileage compared to others."
925410,doubleheader,2015-07-20 14:04:00,497,"Cliff, we've made our decision and it will be a fifth wheel. I'm retiring in about 18 months and we'll buy sometime between now and then. I'm not going full-time, so we plan to buy at maximum a 35' fiver. Most full timers go bigger. This size is easier to haul and allows for more campground options. We will use ours to travel out west and winter down south. I have a 3/4 ton diesel truck and a 2,200 lb pin weight is about the maximum I can haul and be within my 10,000 GVWR. We've been researching 5th wheels for sometime. My #1 choice right now would be a Northwood. Either the Arctic Fox 27-5L or the Fox Mountain 32-RKS.  Northwood makes a very well-built 4 season trailer, but we also like the Silverback 31RK by Cedar Creek. We prefer the rear kitchen models as generally they allow for the largest kitchen and most counter space.  If you go 5th wheel be very aware of your tow vehicles GVWR and GVCWR limitations and remember, all 5th wheel manufacturers list only the unloaded (dry) pin weight. Be especially careful of 1/2 ton towable 5'ers. If you indeed are not overweight it may be because they have built them quit structurally deficient to minimize weight. The biggest RV show in the nation is at Hershey Park in Hershey PA in September. It was fabulous, we went last year and plan to go for two days this year. It's the 1st show of the year where the manufacturers will have their 2016 line-up on display. Every kind of camper imaginable will be there. Good luck."
925411,glen,2015-07-20 14:14:00,2641,What's the cost per night to park it.
925412,davew3,2015-07-20 14:24:00,430,"Cliff,   35 ft is a large trailer to haul around.  I know you want the comfort but consider these.   If you have a 5th wheel the you cannot really store stuff in the box of your truck.  Then you have stairs to deal with and at night they can be a pain. You lose storage space at the front of the trailer.  Also parking it can be a challenge in some temp parks with limited space while on the road.  A well designed 24 ft travel trailer with 2 slide outs would provide all the room you need.  Plus lots of storage.  The interior layout is important.  I have a one slide out, 30ft,  5th wheel with a front bedroom,  middle washroom, middle living room and rear kitchen.  The slide out makes my living room/ kitchen wide enough to provide plenty of room.   Would have liked to get the bedroom slide out, but oh well.  I have this in a park and don't plan to move it as I do not want to put a 5th in my truck.  Check out Sicard trailer.  Good luck with your choice."

One of the things we have been told is that warranties are not transferable so be very careful of anything used. We were also VERY surprised at the prices of new but last years models. We found a couple of really nice 5th wheels with prices starting around $58,000.00 with a beautiful delux one for $83,000.00 (and boy it was beautiful).  Got a lot more looking to do yet but that is why we started now."

925245,bigbuck,2015-07-19 02:40:00,2449,"Cliff, a decent 5th wheel and a diesel pickup to pull it. It won't cost you what an RV would and you can detach and explore when you are set up at a campsite. West Arm made some good points to consider. Good luck. I have always wanted a 3/4ton diesel pickup to pull our 30ft travel trailer across Canada as a dream vacation. One day when I grow up...."
925249,ecmilley,2015-07-19 02:59:00,2163,"the good thing about the 5 th wheel is the ability to disconnect and go, trailers cost much less and you can make money hauling other peoples trailers when the need arises, easier to drive and manuever, downside extra maintenance on tow vehicle annual inspections and initial cost of getting a truck. full size rv- there cool but expensive inlaws paid $150k for theres used it for 5 years sat for 3 sold for $25k"
925250,glen,2015-07-19 03:01:00,2641,Can you travel for ten years or whatever then go to an apartment?  For two people a small motorhome would work.  Then get a screen dinning tent for more space. One of the problems is the cost to park it for the night.

925253,FloatnFly,2015-07-19 03:57:00,1640,"depending on how big you want to go, a new 5th wheel will run 40-80k, plus the cost of the truck to haul it with, and a half ton is not recommended for 5th wheels  If it were me, I'd go with a motorhome, tow your current vehical behind it, park it where ever you want to sleep that night.  Yes, the cost will be higher to buy the motorhome.   Motorhomes are easier to sell than 5th wheel trailers, guy down the street from has had his up for sale for 3 years, very few people own a truck to tow a 5th wheel with, let alone those who have a 5th wheel hitch."
925258,Big Cliff,2015-07-19 09:12:00,6899,"Ya, lots to think about, that's why I thought I'd throw the question up on here and get some feedback.  Diesel would be a must regardless of which mode of transportation we chose.  We are thinking something in the 32 to 36' range, I'd want to be comfortable.  West Arm; excellent points there, experience is the kind of feedback that will really help us. We realize that we wouldn't be able to do it forever, that is why we are thinking of doing it now while we still can. Hopefully for about the next five years then perhaps into a condo.  Ernie, why such a huge loss, was it in bad shape when they did decide to sell it? I have just started looking at some used ones and they seem to hold their value fairly well (at least the better brands do anyway).  Tender52; What size is there's and do they use it full time?"
925261,ketchenany,2015-07-19 10:54:00,3229,Are you going to do small engine repair work on your travels?  If you want to come by I will have a cold one for you

925263,ketchenany,2015-07-19 11:04:00,3229,"The door is open, you putter will be welcomed. One thing, if you call in all your favours you will never have to buy groceries."
925264,Skipper D,2015-07-19 11:30:00,1970,"Cliff you know I've own in the past 30 years every thing from soup to nuts . If you and the wife have the chance to take a drive over here , I'd be glad to show you what Beverly and I decided to go with and retire with  , I think you's will be impressed as well as knowing how well it worked for us for three weeks last summer in Nova Scotia . Give us a shout ."
925269,Tom McCutcheon,2015-07-19 12:40:00,627,"Cliff; it is something that we have been thinking about seriously for a few years also. Need to do this before we get too far past the age of being away from caregivers if needed. I have rented and looked at motor homes (35 to 40 feet) in the past and although they provide everything one could want they are restrictive once you get where you want to go unless you have a smaller vehicle attached, and for me and my 6'5"", 295lb frame, that is not an option. I believe a diesel truck dually and fifth wheel attachment is a good choice. One other thing needed to consider is your provincial health care and the amount of time spent out of province/country.  Good luck with whatever decision you make and we might see each other around a campfire someplace on this continent in the next few years."
925273,captpierre,2015-07-19 13:17:00,2521,"Gotta live the dream, Cliff. Don't know which option is best but makes sense to me to keep your home. Rent it out for a year. Buy a unit used. Fairly new.  Be patient. A great deal will present itself.   The rent covers all costs Give it a whirl. If it's not for you,  you can do plan B. But at least you tried. Livin the Dream. You don't want regrets."

Good luck with whatever decision you make and we might see each other around a campfire someplace on this continent in the next few years. Already looked into the health care, as long as we are in Canada we wouldn't have a problem because we would be dividing our time between the East Coast in the Spring and summers, the West Coast in the winters, and plenty of time in Ontario in between. We wouldn't go into the US (other than just passing through) because the health insurance for Sue is just too high."
925283,woodenboater,2015-07-19 15:27:00,2277,"I'm still a few years away from freedom but SWMBO and I have thought about this as well. If we did follow this path, it'd be a diesel pusher pulling a small vehicle. I wouldn't bother trailering a boat as the times I would want to fish, I'd find a lodge/resort that had camping space and rent their boats. or I'd strap a Portabote to the side for smaller waters.  I like the idea that in a motorhome, everything is in one large space and there's lots of room if travelling with others. Would get cramped in a crew cab on long days. ymmv..haha"
925288,pics,2015-07-19 16:11:00,1268,My dad recently bought a 5th wheel and trailer used as a package.. low miles on both for about half of the retail new price.. because it's a dually it costs more to register and license and requires a yearly inspection.. he's happy to park and set up but with the option of touring with the truck.. anything close by and they use folding bikes..
925294,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-19 17:05:00,8243,"At our age Big Cliff the health issue supersedes the cost of any unit. A few years back Mom who is American insisted she go to Western NY for her last family reunion ""for a few hours"" regardless of my objections as she is uninsurable. You guest it a ER visit to the hospital in North Tonawanda cost them $7200.00 US. Just stay away from the states."
925381,DanD,2015-07-20 11:13:00,2223,"I haven't done a lot of research on ""Home Exchange""; but it sure sounds interesting. Drive or fly to whatever part of canada and move in for your stay there. You can buy a lot of air time for the money you'd spend getting set up with either the motorhome or a 5th wheel.  https://www.homeexchange.com/en/s/Canada/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=%2Bcanadian+house+swap&utm_campaign=HE+USA+-+Location+Specific+%28World+Targeting%29&mkwid=sP9US9aKf%7Cdc&pcrid=53327384994&gclid=Cj0KEQjwuLKtBRDPicmJyvu_qZMBEiQAzlGN5rmvRVjG6bMCFqYe_Inrmakp7sHtrfaITWRl75awT7AaAmdU8P8HAQ&page=2  No doubt there are likely some pitfalls with this program; like I said I haven't done a lot of research on it yet?  Dan."
925384,Big Cliff,2015-07-20 11:41:00,6899,"That could be interesting Dan, I think I'd really like to talk to some people that have done this and see what their experience was like. I did go to the site for a bit but I couldn't find any reviews from people that had actually stayed at some of the homes. I'll go back and have a second look when I get a bit more time."
