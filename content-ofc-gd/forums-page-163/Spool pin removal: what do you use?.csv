After seeing the spool shafts on a couple of the used reels I picked up, I'll need to get the spool pin out and clean up the shafts a bit. I saw a picture of the Daiwa tool which looks pretty solid, anyone used it? Is eBay the only place to find one of these? I know I can get the Hedgehog tool locally but something about the way the Daiwa tool looks to be built really appeals to me. Any other suggestions? They don't need to be fishing-specific tools either, as long as they work well and don't mar the shaft or ruin the pin. Thanks!"

I didn't want to buy a tool for these two reels so I used a set of channel locks and set it up so that top piece would overhang the bottom piece enough to push the pin out. If done correctly and you take your time, you will not scratch or mar that the shaft at all. The key is taking your time.  If I had more reels that would need it, I would have bought the Boca pliers or the Hedgehog tool. If you can get one locally, I would just go that route."
928727,adam lancia,2015-08-10 17:50:00,234,I ended up ordering the Daiwa tool from eBay. I already had something coming from that seller so I just got them to piggy back the tool onto the order.
