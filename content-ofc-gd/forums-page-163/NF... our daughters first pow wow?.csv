928489,manitoubass2,2015-08-09 04:58:00,11391,Kookum took her dancin at the big grassy pow wow. Regalia looks awesome?  Wish I coulda been there but im still laid up with an infection in my foot?    With kokum  
928493,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-09 05:37:00,8243,"Is kokum Mom Rick? They both look gorgeous. It must be like an Italian Roman Catholic having their First Holy Communion. It used to be big deal in our family. Now no one knows what religion the kids are, if any. I remember my niece saying when they were little ""we aren't part Italian Mom, we don't have a kitchen in our basement"".  You must be sad you missed it Rick, you will have another chance soon. What's with the foot?"
928494,manitoubass2,2015-08-09 06:28:00,11391,"Kookum is grandma OI  Yeah im bummed i missed it but i get to see her dance tomorrow?  She even won a spot dance award tonight?  Im so hyped to go watch her dance tomorrow its gonna probably make me cry lol.  Although im ukranian, italian, german, and norwegian. I love the aboriginal aspect of my better half and our children! Such a respectful heritage(not that the others arent as well)  Ive been out with a staph infection in my foot near my big toe. Been about 8 days of pure hell. Horrible. But its getting better?  And heres a pic of my better half just so ya know lol    Shed kill me if she knew i posted a photo of her lol"
928495,manitoubass2,2015-08-09 06:48:00,11391,"And it is a communion of sorts.  I dont know how to explain it?  Its almost like military pride.  The elders accept you( even though we are a blended family)  But they cry, show soooo much respect to see the traditions carried on. Its just a huge honour.  Makes me very very proud?  At one with the earth as they say.  Its healing, very emotional. The dances are beautiful and all thats good in this world"

928540,Joey,2015-08-09 15:05:00,9122,Awesome pics  That's a one a spicy meat ball LOL!
928547,manitoubass2,2015-08-09 15:58:00,11391,Yep! We hit the powows every year! Its always awesome!  My personal favorites are the traditional powows but those are becoming rare. Lots are all just dance specials now.  My wife couldnt go because she is pregnant. Thats a nono. If you dance or attend a pow wow pregnant your offering your child to the creator
