927956,fishinmortician,2015-08-05 20:05:00,100,"http://www.georgencharters.com/boatand_rates/index.html  I have never used this company, but have seen them around.  There are also charters on north end of Lake Simcoe that might be worth while. (happy go lucky fishing)"
928080,Reel Man,2015-08-06 07:05:00,80,"I highly recommend Redline Outdoors.  redlineoutdoors.ca  They are based in Muskoka but will travel around to any of the abundant lakes in the area.  Eddy was fantastic and very knowledgeable, had a great day of bass fishing with my wife. (my fianc√©e at the time)  Great guys and a great time for a reasonable price."
928097,BillM,2015-08-06 13:20:00,17367,If you want salmon/trout head to OS.  I wouldn't bother wasting my time fishing out of Midland.
928118,huzzsaba,2015-08-06 15:09:00,884,"thanks for the recommendations. I already spoke to Bill from George N charters, but scheduling is an issue.  Redline outdoors sounds fun and I will definitely try to book them when I head up to algonquin later in September.  BillM, do you mean Owen Sound? The reason I was thinking of Midland was because I am going there soon.  There is a charter running out of Owen Sound there by the name of action fishing or something like that, If anyone has any reviews on this charter please let me know..  Thanks."
928140,Cast-Away,2015-08-06 17:27:00,790,There are one or two charter guys out of 12 MIle Bay 30 minutes north of Midland. I can't find anything on line but do see them from the water.
