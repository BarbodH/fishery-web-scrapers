927825,linweir,2015-08-05 04:14:00,202,"Total weight of my boat rig (boat/motor/trailer) is about 1800 pd. Using electric trailer mover to launch it to water is probably OK.  My concern is if it's possible to pull loaded trailer with boat back up to boat ramp after using it? Boat ramp has an incline, but my boat rig is not heavy.  I am looking for power dolly or trailer mover? Any suggestion?  "
927831,Roy,2015-08-05 09:19:00,13728,Why can't you use the tow vehicle? Is it a public ramp or a private one?
927852,linweir,2015-08-05 12:41:00,202,"I store my boat in a resort. Boat ramp is not far, Sometimes I couldn't have a vehicle with towing hitch."
927854,MrSimon,2015-08-05 12:58:00,217,Can you just try it and find out?
927858,Ralph Field,2015-08-05 13:16:00,1018,"If the owner of the resort has a tractor, then I would ask him to lend a hand."
