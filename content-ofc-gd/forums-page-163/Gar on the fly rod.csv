We saw hundreds gulping air early in the day but with the storm and cool night they were hanging deep and not laying in the shallows until later in the day. They final moved up but by then boat traffic was crazy stirring up the shoreline and making things really difficult. Managed to land one an dad and I both lost a few more. I really wish we got the big ones like the East end of the Lake but they are still fun to change things up a bit
