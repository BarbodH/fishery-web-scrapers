925950,Dave Bailey,2015-07-24 00:53:00,1641,"A few of these are found near water, so be careful. Water hemlock is probably the most dangerous, just tasting it can kill, you don't even need to swallow any. http://www.ourwindsor.ca/whatson-story/5743130-5-poisonous-plants-of-southern-ontario-you-should-avoid/"
926129,pics,2015-07-25 15:27:00,1268,One of my favorite books is about swamp and bogs.. it explains each plant in detail and what the natives used it for.. water Hemlock was a common suicide plant because it is quick and relatively painless..
926131,davey buoy,2015-07-25 15:41:00,5505,"Great info Dave,it's no wonder why more up us don't get sick.You see these plants quite often,depending where you are."
926166,misfish,2015-07-25 22:46:00,29133,   Last year I posted a pic of this plant. It is lassed along an entry walk to the notty. I stay clear of it.  Great post.
926167,manitoubass2,2015-07-25 23:03:00,11391,One place I fish is chock full of giant hogweed brian. Gotta tread the path carefully.  In the link someone posted stinging nettle. That craps pretty harmless. Doesnt even effect me after one sting in the past.  Now i harvest it for teas and tinctures
926168,manitoubass2,2015-07-25 23:05:00,11391,And alot of people mistake giant hogweed for a plant I think is calles queen annes lace. Flower is similar but a different leaf
926175,Dave Bailey,2015-07-25 23:46:00,1641,"Queen Anne's lace, or wild carrot, only grows a couple of feet high at most. Giant hogweed grows up to 18 feet. The related and native cow parsnip, which has similar toxins but not quite as bad, grows about half that high.  And I should add that if you see any hogweed you should call the Ontario Invading Species Hotline at 1-800-563-7711"
926177,FrankTheRabbit,2015-07-26 00:05:00,479,"I think wild parsnips is aka Queen's Annes Lace, deadly indeed."
926180,manitoubass2,2015-07-26 00:19:00,11391,"Cow parsnip, thats it dave.  It gets big around here, well not giant hogweed big but it grows to about 5-6 feet.  Ill take some pics on sunday because I might not be indentifying it correctly"
926181,manitoubass2,2015-07-26 00:20:00,11391,Oh i called the mnr last year about the giant hogweed round here. Its spreading fast and in populated areas
926183,FloatnFly,2015-07-26 00:27:00,1640,great article here identifying each variety  http://www.durhamregion.com/community-story/5742725-wild-parsnip-cow-parsnip-giant-hogweed-can-you-identify-them-and-which-is-most-toxic-/
927754,OhioFisherman,2015-08-04 22:47:00,6623,http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/04/us/giant-hogweed-feat/index.html  A CNN story on the giant hogweed today.
927955,Rod Caster,2015-08-05 20:05:00,5784,"Lots of Cow's Parsnip on my property. It seems to grow in recently disturbed areas, like where new trails are made.  I ate some earlier this this year; the new growth is what is recommended to eat. I did not like the flavor so I won't bother with it again.  I got stung by Nettles on the Notty years ago. Christ did that send me for a loop until I researched it."
927981,manitoubass2,2015-08-05 21:27:00,11391,"Nettle hurt like a mother...  And ya kinda freak out when it starts swelling so fast lol.  Funny thing is I got it once, later I could smack a plant on my arm and nothing  Seem immune to it now"
