928333,glen,2015-08-07 22:50:00,2641,How many sheets.
928346,Gerritt,2015-08-07 23:36:00,6129,"Pricing is normally based upon square footage of board.... And there is a big difference... you'll pay more for a small job then a larger one. The more Sqf the lower the price per Sqf.  Not sure where you live, as there is a market for decent tapers....but a good taper is worth his weight in gold.  G"

928361,Entropy,2015-08-08 01:27:00,747,about 17 sheets
928363,Gerritt,2015-08-08 01:41:00,6129,"Pretty small job. Not knowing the layout, I would estimate 400-600.....  Not worth it for a professional fulltime taper otherwise.... And if you did find one, this would more then likely be a side job. And would be taped in a weekend, sanded the following weekend..... ( good tapers should barely have to sand at all)  Where are you located? If in the Hamilton area I know of a couple of guys that might be willing to offer assistance.  G"

928394,Parnelly,2015-08-08 13:53:00,108,"honestly taper is gonna have to see how the board is installed to give you a price us rookies can cause them headaches lol This ^  Unnessary butt joints, improper board installation(flats on walls smaller than 4') and many other things generally brings the price up. I recently taped a place that had 3 to 4 butts per run, could have easily been done with 12' sheets and 1 or 2 less butts per run. Had to charge more for this based on lack of knowledge from the board installers.  I find myself taping more and more these days, but am mainly a framer and a boardman. Hate when people call me to tape up a board mess. Generally refuse/turn down jobs because of that."
