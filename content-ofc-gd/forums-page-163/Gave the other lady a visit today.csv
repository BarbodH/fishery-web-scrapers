Headed down to  Erie this morning with my usual fishing partner.  Today was teach him how to  set up and drop the riggers day - the weather man was calling for gentle winds all day. We made the I long run out to 59 FOW off Burwell (about 13? miles), and I did the initial set up. First line was barely down and second one not even rigged when she fired with the big girl of the day.  I don't think G was really awake  yet     not his usual smile for a big girl   about 30 minutes later one slightly smaller hit, and we thought we were in for a hot day. But after a quick flurry it slowed down and we ended up with 4 for 6 on the walters , accompanied by a few of the usual non target species getting in the mix. G had the rigger thing going pretty good by the end of the day.   got a nice one for the table , too   I could do a month of days like this,..... actually, I could do this year round if the weather would just cooperate  "

Hey Michael - you just gave  me an idea -- Maybe I should have tried making the barnyard beasties  my target species? The walleye would bite just to spite me, you think?   I didn't realize walleye were so camera shy  Let me get this straight Rick... You don't like -30 and blowing winds? Chad, if I could find a way, I would gladly give you my portion of that, 'cause I know you enjoy it so. Me, As you know, I prefer things, shall we say, less frigid.  Love lake Erie for the multitude of species in near proximity to each other, went out a couple weeks back went for walleye in the morning bass at noon, and ended up with a walleye in 9 fow a couple smallies, silver bass and of course sheepshead haha.  Nice day! Definitely lots of opportunity for tightlines on E at almost any launch, A B&W day is still on my radar for this year too Lucas - got a spot in mind, just have to get my guide on the right day when he is available and the weather is smiling"
