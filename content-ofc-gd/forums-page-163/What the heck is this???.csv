927707,Gerritt,2015-08-04 19:14:00,6129,No clue what it is. Perhaps you guys might have an answer?       ????  G
927708,fishindevil,2015-08-04 19:19:00,6254,Looks like railway slag ??? I have seen them look like that before !!! It's the slag rock they use to line the railway tracks I think ?? Hmmmm where did you find it
927709,Joey,2015-08-04 19:21:00,9122,Meteorite ?
927711,Gerritt,2015-08-04 19:22:00,6129,"On my front lawn, after the storm...."
927713,Rich Clemens,2015-08-04 19:26:00,3131,My thoughts too ..  a piece of slag.
927715,Raf,2015-08-04 19:28:00,3495,piece of your neighbours lawn ornament?
927720,woodenboater,2015-08-04 19:45:00,2277,"stick piece of iron beside it ands see if it's sticks. if object is magnetic, possibly meteorite. maybe take it to the Royal Ontario Museum ? They have a ton of meteorites there, some are gigantic. I could barely lift one of the pieces they had and it wasn't very large.  but I doubt it. meteorites don't tend to be hollow. could be slag but how it got to your lawn is beyond me"
927725,Headhunter,2015-08-04 20:08:00,5703,Sophisticated Meatball left over from years gone by? LOL I'll go with slag as well! HH

927759,Ron,2015-08-04 23:14:00,1683,Petrified Easter Bunny?
927761,solopaddler,2015-08-04 23:18:00,8605,Something just......hatched.  Lock your doors.
927763,OhioFisherman,2015-08-04 23:25:00,6623,"It looks slag to me too, we had a number of steel mills here in Cleveland back in the day, and sometimes it was used instead of gravel before concrete drives were put down. Most if not all limestone had to be hauled or trained in from out of the general area, so it was cheaper."
927770,GBW,2015-08-04 23:39:00,8460,Did you hear Armageddon!!... the gerbil version...
927772,Gerritt,2015-08-04 23:47:00,6129,"Lol thanks for the laughs guys:) yeah weird for sure! I'm about 1.5km from the railway that divides our little town, all I see is rocks around the rail lines.... But not knowing what rail slag is or was I was a bit perplexed.  I'm guessing some kid got bored with his treasure and threw it out the window on their way home from the PP just down the road.  I'm just glad ET didn't drop a deuce on my front lawn.  G"
