It serves the purpose, but I would like to redo the inside (floors, vinyl covering, new hatch tops for the storage, etc.)  I know a lot of people on here have done these types of renos.  Would appreciate direction to some great resources on ""how to"".  Also, what did the average cost to do it?"

Got lots of stuff from west marine hatches etc"
928598,glen,2015-08-09 23:16:00,2641,600 min. Check your foam to see if it will hold water.  If not you could reuse.  Use normal good one side ply and paint it.  Homedepot has boat vinyl.  Hatches ain't cheap shop around.

When you remove hardware, bag it and tag it, you will thank yourself later when the time comes for re-assembly. I would suggest that you use an epoxy resin on all six sides after the pieces are cut and fitted to waterproof the good one side exterior grade plywood. Good luck with the restoration, it is a lot of work but well worth it in the end. There is a bass boat forum that has a really good sub-forum on restoration. May be worth a look. PM me if you don't know the site already."
