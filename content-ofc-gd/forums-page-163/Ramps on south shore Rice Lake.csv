927969,mattybculp,2015-08-05 20:37:00,388,"I have never launched on that side of the lake but there are multiple boat launches according to navionics. Maybe sinker can chime in, he is pretty familiar with rice."
927975,gaspumper,2015-08-05 21:05:00,393,"There is a pretty good ramp at Harwood they charge $10.00 to launch,it's on the right side of the Rd at the cottages called holiday cabins.when you go out on the lake you are at Tick island."

928062,Sinker,2015-08-06 02:06:00,8692,"I launch off the north shore as I live on the north side of the lake. Ive lanched at harwood before, but there was no parking.  S."
928076,floater,2015-08-06 05:52:00,220,Gores Landing has a free launch and you park up the road for free. Not too bad a launch. Good for smaller boats. And there is a port a poti there too and a place to tie up.
928094,Sinker,2015-08-06 13:10:00,8692,"I'm pretty sure you can launch at Harris boat works as well. There is a fee I'm sure, but they do have a launch there.  S."
928214,frodobuggins,2015-08-07 01:01:00,127,Ended up launching at Harris Boatworks. Was 10$ but great ramp/parking facility so no biggie. Thanks all
