Is there a charge for a second tow if needed? I can't see them towing every idiot that runs out of fuel more than once.

I got flown out by helicopter after loosing a canoe in rapids on a canoe trip. The OPP asked a lot of questions about our whitewater experience, were we drinking/ stoned etc.  I think they use their discretion. I was worried about getting a big bill in the mail, but never did.  When guys need a heli rescue on sketchy ice on Simcoe, they get charged."
