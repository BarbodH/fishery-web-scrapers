927705,bucktail,2015-08-04 19:04:00,1857,I have my brother and nephew coming down tomorrow for some fishing and the problem is I haven't been out on Lake O in a couple weeks. I was wondering if anyone who has been out over the weekend could give me a few starting depths to try.  Also is the bluezone going out of Port Credit yet?  It is a long run if the fish aren't there.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Darren

927856,Steve,2015-08-05 13:14:00,2075,I'd just go for lakers.....  more fun than 4-6lbs fish on king gear.  start in 90' and work deeper.  keep your balls 5' or less off bottom.  some kings down there as well.
928018,Freshtrax,2015-08-05 23:16:00,2215,How did you do?   We hooked a few smalls and a decent rainbow.   Ice cold out there.
