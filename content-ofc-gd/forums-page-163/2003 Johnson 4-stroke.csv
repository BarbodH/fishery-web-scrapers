However, the motor has a switch on it and i could trim both ways from there.  Is this a solenoid issue? If it is, is it something i can swap out on my own? Cheers"
928255,2 tone z71,2015-08-07 11:18:00,1311,Sounds like the switch in the handle failed ..if it still goes up/down at the motor ...could have been a relay but not if its still functioning
928285,mike rousseau,2015-08-07 16:21:00,4661,Should be the switch  Same thing happened to me  Changed the switch and everything was good to go
928286,bigbuck,2015-08-07 16:43:00,2449,Switch. The relays and everything else works so it has to be that switch in the handle. Should not be too difficult.

928365,ecmilley,2015-08-08 01:48:00,2163,switch most likely but have repaired many broken wires for the same thing in the handle.
