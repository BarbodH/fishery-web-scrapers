927379,Raf,2015-08-02 23:55:00,3495,Cut off switches are common in automotive use. You cant get on some drag strips without one.  There's nothing fancy about them.  Id defiantly eliminate the battery or fix any wiring first but if the problem is not apparent it's a way around your problem.
927736,Ksword,2015-08-04 21:27:00,40,Similar thing happened to my ATV...it was a faulty voltage regulator...  Chances are the new battery is good but there is a 'leak' somewhere...
927743,wormdunker,2015-08-04 21:57:00,1711,"Check the electrolyte  (water) in your battery.  Make sure it is up to the proper level.  I check my trolling motor batteries about every 6 weeks, year round.  I found one where the water level had gone down quite a bit.  Why - I don't know.  Lottsa good advice offered by the crew.  If all else fails - put a trickle charger (smart charger) on the battery (2 amp charge) when you have finished your work for the day.  Leave it charging 24/7.  Next time you want to play in the yards, it will go VROOM VROOM!  Good luck"

927273,lew,2015-08-02 17:01:00,12766,Hi guys  I've got a riding mower that I removed the mower deck from and just use it for hauling a cart around when I'm moving things.  Runs great and I put in a new battery a month ago.  I went to use it last week and the battery was dead so I figured I must have left the key on so I charged it up and it ran great.  I put it away and left it sit all week and when I went to start it this morning the battery was dead again and I know for a fact the key was in the off position so that's not the problem.  I looked at all the wiring as best as I could and can't see any cracked or broken wires that could be shorting out and nothing else is apparent.  The ignition has a position to run the lights or not and the key definitely wasn't left in that spot.  Any thoughts ??  
927274,irishfield,2015-08-02 17:22:00,26272,"Before you get too far, try unhooking the battery for a few days and make sure it's not just a bad one.  Once you've determined it's good I'd suspect a draw from a voltage regulator that's on it's way out."
927275,davey buoy,2015-08-02 17:24:00,5505,"It could be your alternator not charging,or something as simple as a bad cell in a new battery.That has happened ."
927276,kickingfrog,2015-08-02 17:27:00,8333,"Likely the A/C, stereo/woofer and ground effect lighting system are drawing too much from your battery."
927277,lew,2015-08-02 17:27:00,12766,"Wayne, I thought of unhooking the battery once it's charged and let it sit to see if that's the problem, so thanks for confirming it.  Any way to test that regulator to see if it's the trouble maker ?"
927278,misfish,2015-08-02 17:28:00,29133,"Before you get too far, try unhooking the battery for a few days and make sure it's not just a bad one.    Thats where I would start as well."
927279,lew,2015-08-02 17:30:00,12766,"Sorry guys, we were all posting at the same time.  Davey, the tractor hasn't run since last week so I'm guessing it's something drawing current while it sits idle.  And Rob, I'll try running it without the AC next time LOL"
927280,misfish,2015-08-02 17:30:00,29133,LOL Rob.
927282,Raf,2015-08-02 17:30:00,3495,"and if you can't find the source, and it's not the battery, i'd just put in a kill switch that you flip on and off when you use the mower."
927283,lew,2015-08-02 17:33:00,12766,"and if you can't find the source, and it's not the battery, i'd just put in a kill switch that you flip on and off when you use the mower.  Which wires would connect to the switch Raf ??"
927284,Raf,2015-08-02 17:34:00,3495,i'd put it in-line with your negative wire coming off the battery.
927285,davey buoy,2015-08-02 17:36:00,5505,"If you have a bad cell Lew,a switch won't help you.I'd try what Wayne said and disconnect for a few days and then check your voltage.That will at least eliminate the battery if it's still reading full charge."
927286,misfish,2015-08-02 17:39:00,29133,"Yup  Just pull the positive  connecter off the terminal Lew. After a few days, just put it back on and crank it up. No need for pulling the battery out. You will know then if the battery is good or not."
927293,lew,2015-08-02 18:11:00,12766,"Thanks guys that's the plan, once it's charged I'll disconnect and let it sit for awhile and then see what happens."
927302,Big Cliff,2015-08-02 18:49:00,6899,"Actually Lew, pull the negitive cable off the battery, you ALWAYS disconnect the negitive cable first and re hook it last (except in a positive ground system). Reason is that if you did short ground to ground while disconnecting/reconnecting the negitive cable it won't matter, if you were to short the positive cable to ground while the negitive cable is still connected  ...... well you'll have a dead short to ground and it won't be nice.  A switch in the negitive circuit probably won't do you any good, too much current when starting the tractor, it would take one heck of a switch to handle that load, could be done but not practicle.  Check to see if the tractor is charging the battery; just put a volt meter set to DCV across the terminals of the battery and measure the voltage. Then start the tractor, the voltage should read something at or above 13V while the tractor is running, if it doesn't then you probably have a problem with your charging curcit.  Try those things first and if you are still having trouble let me know, I could try to drop over one day this week and have a look at it for you."
927305,lew,2015-08-02 19:03:00,12766," Try those things first and if you are still having trouble let me know, I could try to drop over one day this week and have a look at it for you.  Thanks Cliff, I'm certainly not a mechanic and don't have a circuit tester but certainly appreciate your offer about coming over.  Trouble is, Diane and I are heading to the West Arm of Nipissing on Saturday for a couple weeks of getting slimed and I'll be busy here all week getting things ready.  I'm gonna leave the battery disconnected till around Thursday and then try and start the tractor. If the battery is dead again with nothing hooked to it, that'll mean it's faulty and I'll return it for another one.  If it starts, that means I've got something draining it  and maybe when your not doing anything someday after I get home I'll bring it over to your place and you can have a look....if you don't mind."
927306,misfish,2015-08-02 19:06:00,29133,  Well I guess doing what I said for a month on the old beater was wrong. It got me by. LOL
927308,bigbuck,2015-08-02 19:08:00,2449,"Lew, we had the same issue with our lawn tractor here at the cottage. Bad battery on a new tractor. Try disconnecting as suggested."

927310,misfish,2015-08-02 19:15:00,29133, Yes Cliff. I should of   . LOL  Lew. You and D have a great relaxing holiday. Leave those big fish alone. You might pull a musle or something.
927314,lew,2015-08-02 19:38:00,12766,"   Lew. You and D have a great relaxing holiday. Leave those big fish alone. You might pull a musle or something.  Thanks Brian, but the only thing I plan on pulling is those big brutes over the gunnels of my boat"
927331,Bernie,2015-08-02 21:09:00,3190,"A quick test I sometimes use in a pinch to find a drain and how much of a drain on smaller machines is to use a couple of fuses. Turn off everything and disconnect negative terminal. Start with a 20 amp fuse, touch one end to battery,other to cable. Ideally, the fuse shouldn't blow. Look for arcing when you touch them together. Then go to a 10 amp, do the same thing. Progress down until the fuse blows, that will give you the approximate amperage drain. Once you determine for sure the drain is below 10amps you should be able to use your multimeter (if you have one) in line to get the definitive number. Reading should be almost zero on anything without radio or computer controls. Even a 1/4 amp is enough to kill a battery over a few days."
927335,lew,2015-08-02 21:38:00,12766,"Thanks Bernie but no, I don't have a multi meter but I'll check around and see if a neighbor has one."
927341,porkpie,2015-08-02 22:02:00,2521,"For an old mower converted to a wagon hauler, this is what I'd do also.  They sell switches that attach directly to your battery terminal, then to the battery cable at princess auto for $7.  They are designed specifically as a battery cutoff to avoid draining down a battery by accident. Shipping from PA is cheap like borscht also!"
927349,lew,2015-08-02 22:34:00,12766,"Thanks porkpie, I'll keep that in mind if the problem isn't with the new battery."
