928272,manitoubass2,2015-08-07 14:03:00,11391,"Thats horribly invasive.  I just tried it on a few photos(didnt know how to do it so i had to tinker around.)  Not only will it give me co ords and show me on a map, it tells me what camera your using etc.  And i seen a few that weren't smart phones  Weird thing is it wont show me the info on my photos even though i probably had gps enabled most of the time  OFC should change this"
928278,cram,2015-08-07 14:43:00,1733,Why strip the GPS coordinates from your fish photos when you could have so much more fun replacing them with the coordinates of the settling pond at the sewage treatment plant? Ha - that's funny.
928284,netminder,2015-08-07 16:15:00,514,Why strip the GPS coordinates from your fish photos when you could have so much more fun replacing them with the coordinates of the settling pond at the sewage treatment plant? My brown trout fishing hole? I think not!
928112,Sterling,2015-08-06 14:49:00,477,"Thought long and hard whether I wanted to open this can of worms... figured I might save one of you guys from getting in trouble. Then again, this might get someone in trouble too.  When you take a photo with any device, additional data is written to the image file. This data, called EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format), stores information about the photo and the device that took it. This includes; And GPS COORDINATES - but only if your GPS is on (duh). So by sharing photos of your fish, you could be inadvertently sharing the lake on which it was caught. If the photo was taken right where the fish was caught (as they often are), you're also sharing the exact spot on the lake.  I was able to use EXIF data to pull GPS coordinates right off photos here at OFC, so this is not theory, it is real.  Some devices make use of A-GPS, meaning you don't need an actual GPS to get coordinates. These devices use cell towers to triangulate your location. I don't own such a device but they are quite popular (most Apple tablets for example). I don't know if it's possible to turn this off.  What's more, EXIF also stores the exact time and date the picture was taken. I found photos of fish caught out of season right here on OFC (people just wait and post them when in season).  The DO's and DONT'S: Here's an example using a turtle picture I took a couple months ago:   Anyway, hope this saves someone from inadvertently sharing their favorite spot(s)."
928114,Gallie,2015-08-06 15:00:00,1215,"There are apps out there you can get that will do the same as photobucket and remove the gps coordinates, 9 times out of 10 i wouldnt care if people knew but there are exceptions. If i had to do years of searching and ground work to find a lake in the bush that finally produces what i want, i wouldnt want the whole of the internet to know too. However i might trade it for another spot from a member via pm. The app i have is called koredoko i believe."
928122,mepps,2015-08-06 15:38:00,1301,"Good advice, though I don't mind if people know my spots. I just don't want people to know i'm on a lake when I'm supposed to be at work! lol"
928148,akaShag,2015-08-06 18:42:00,2073,"Very good advice, which a lot of us (ahem) older folks would not know.  I did post a fishing picture on another website and a tech-savvy buddy of mine let me know that the picture had the GPS coordinates in it.  The photo had been taken by a buddy with his cell phone, then sent to me via e-mail.  THEN I uploaded it to a photo-hosting site that I use, and then posted it to the fishing website.  So that GPS info travelled with that picture through several devices and processes!!!  Fortunately my ancient camera does not have GPS, and I don't think my cell phone has GPS, but it can't take a picture anyway.  Thanks for posting this!Doug"

928164,adolson,2015-08-06 20:49:00,783,"On a mobile phone, OK, but don't go accusing people for OOS fish based on a datestamp if it's a regular camera. I pretty much never have my date and time set properly on my cameras because it's too much hassle for no real point. Some of them drift a lot, some of them reset whenever you pull the battery. I guess if the datestamp on an image looks reasonably legit, then sure, but still."
928167,glen,2015-08-06 21:07:00,2641,A digital camera dosnt  have gps.  It's a smart phone concern only?
928170,Gerritt,2015-08-06 21:35:00,6129,You would/could be incorrect there.... Many cameras are capable.  Good topic for discussion.
928172,Gallie,2015-08-06 21:42:00,1215,I dont need a datastamp to see people fishing oos... I can yell at them from my backyard april to june?
928176,irishfield,2015-08-06 22:16:00,26272,"Yes Glen, as Gerritt points out even point and shoot cameras have GPS capability. My Panasonic Lumex has it.. turned off."

This would explain the large gathering this spring out laker fishing. They were all over Terry and I. Thats it, going back to this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Hell I think theres one still around  here. I even have a scanner so, NO GPS FOR YOU LOL  "
928184,BillM,2015-08-06 23:03:00,17367,"Upload to PB, it strips EXIF automatically..  Still not a smart idea to embed your GPS info into your fishing pics if you don't have to, lol."
928186,206,2015-08-06 23:08:00,563,Years ago this was an issue I don't believe there are any sites that share the EXIF anymore? If you find any let me know

928203,cram,2015-08-07 00:25:00,1733,So what you're saying is......we should all be heading over to Fisherpete's LOTW report and stealing his spots?

928222,smitty55,2015-08-07 02:06:00,928,Good heads up there Sterling. A lot of folks don't realize this. Can you imagine having your back lake honey hole raped? There are several exif stripper programs out there. Here's one. http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/File-Management/EXiFStripper.shtml  Cheers
928224,manitoubass2,2015-08-07 03:16:00,11391,"Might as well mention all the other crap you(we) agree to when we download apps.  Unreal what they ask for, access to your camera and pics, phone numbers, video to name a few"
928242,mike rousseau,2015-08-07 04:23:00,4661,Not only fishing spots to protect... But your home and family as well...  Watched a documentary where in a few weeks of online picture stalking a hacker knew where the family lived... The kids favourite park... Their best friends home... Their favourite restaurants... And more...  Scary stuff
928258,MJIG,2015-08-07 11:33:00,227,Why strip the GPS coordinates from your fish photos when you could have so much more fun replacing them with the coordinates of the settling pond at the sewage treatment plant?

928263,Old Ironmaker,2015-08-07 12:04:00,8243,My mobile phone has holes in the dial that you put your fingers in the numbers. It is mobile because it has a long cord on it and I can take it into the next room. You think I'm kidding?
928270,adolson,2015-08-07 13:55:00,783," When it's a smartphone you can be fairly certain the date hasn't been manipulated. Like I said, can of worms. Not always illegal either, there's a reason I'm not mentioning any names . True. There are tons of year-round brookie lakes around here, and I do tend to hit them up after the others are shut down.  I do like the replacing of coordinates idea... Only problem is I'd want to see if anyone showed up."
