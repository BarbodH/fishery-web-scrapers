It's a pretty nice area to boot.  https://www.google.ca/maps/place/295+Steamship+Bay+Rd,+Gravenhurst,+ON+P1P+1Z9/@44.920253,-79.391566,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4d2a9a8af9117fe9:0x815f1c588790b618  Some nice crappie there, along with LM bass.  You can also head up the road to the mouth of the Hoc Roc river on Muskoka Beach Rd, where you might find a pike or three."
