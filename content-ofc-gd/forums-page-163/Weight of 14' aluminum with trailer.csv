926765,LostAnotherOne,2015-07-30 13:45:00,956,"Just bought a new truck and only has a max towing of 1500lbs.  Just wondering if anyone can tell me if I am going to have any problems towing a boat, trailer, and say a 9.9 on the back.  Thanks"
926768,ccmtcanada,2015-07-30 13:53:00,7971,"Is it just a tinny or are there heavy wooden floors added?  Unless the floors are made of lead, I'm sure you'll be fine.  A tinny with a 9.9 and trailer would be around 1000 pounds Max is think.  If floors maybe add a hundred pounds.  I think you're fine."
926769,LostAnotherOne,2015-07-30 14:00:00,956,"Will add wooden floors eventually plus a trolling motor, but for right now just the basics."
926770,AKRISONER,2015-07-30 14:05:00,5558,I can nearly single handedly pick up my 14 with a 15 on it. I can actually pick up the entire front by myself without issue. and am able to lift the back when i lift really really hard...it probably weighs 300lbs max.  The trailer I cant imagine weighing an insane amount either.  Youll be totally fine.
926772,ccmtcanada,2015-07-30 14:14:00,7971,"I pulled a 14ft aluminum boat, 18hp motor and trailer with a Honda CRV.  It pulled it just fine.  I'm sure your truck can handle it with no issues at all."
926773,LostAnotherOne,2015-07-30 14:20:00,956,Haha.  That's exactly what I bought a few days ago.
926774,Raf,2015-07-30 14:22:00,3495,"my 14.5 w/tm, full floors/casting deck, 40 4-stroke, plus trailer is likely under 1k all in.  you will be ok."
926776,John Bacon,2015-07-30 14:44:00,3277,"How much weight will be in the truck?  The towing capacity for all weight being towed plus the cargo and passengers inside the truck.  The boat, motor, & trailer will should be well under 1,500 pounds.  But, if you have four large guys and their luggage in addition to the boat you will likely be over the limit."
926777,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-30 14:52:00,4399,"Not to worry 4 large guys and all their luggage,beer,tackle,etc,etc won`t fit in a CRV anyways....."
926785,porkpie,2015-07-30 15:45:00,2521,"I have a 16 foot boat, full floor, casting deck, livewell and lockers with a 50hp as well as 3 batteries.  It weighs just a shade under 1500lbs with trailer.  I had it weighed at the dump scales.  I prefer to pull it with my truck, but often will tow and launch it with a 4 cylinder SUV if I'm travelling a fair distance and want to save gas.  You'll be fine with a tinner!"
926822,DOS,2015-07-30 19:15:00,119,"What truck do you have that only hAS  a 1500lb towing capacity? Or is it your hitch?  Bumper hitches are 250lb tonge weight 1500 towing. Any way you put it, you will be well under 1000lbs, dont worry.  I know a guy that hauls a 14' sea nymph with a 20, fully loaded with an Accord..."

926933,DOS,2015-07-31 14:43:00,119,"I thought he said he bought a new truck.  A CRV is a car,  LOL"
926939,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-31 15:38:00,4399,Yep 2 bags of groceries and a bottle of Pino.....  :clapping:
927071,wormdunker,2015-08-01 09:06:00,1711,"I have a 14' Lund with 20 hp yammy 4 stroke, MinnKota electric trolling motor, 2 batteries & other miscellaneous gear such as paddles, anchor, mooring lines (small stuff).  I just did a quick breakdown of my  total weight being towed. Boat with full floor 350 lbs    (boat is 285 lbs - bare bones) Yammy                 140 lbs MinnKota                40 lbs 2 batteries             120 lbs Trailer                    250 lbs?? (only an educated guess) Total                       900lbs Small stuff add         50 lbs I'm sure you will be OK."
927104,Mister G,2015-08-01 14:20:00,1429,I never heard of a truck that has a 1500 lb towing capacity......Is it for midgets because I think a Mini Cooper could tow a 14 tinny around.
927156,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-01 19:59:00,956,Thanks guys for the advice.  Very much appreciated.
928893,joeybacala,2015-08-11 02:57:00,63,"If you want a rough idea what it weighs, go to Legend boat sit and try matching up to theirs. It will be in ball park."
