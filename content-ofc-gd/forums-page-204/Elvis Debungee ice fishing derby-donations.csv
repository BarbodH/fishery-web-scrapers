883535,manitoubass2,2014-11-27 14:35:00,11391,"thanks! when a huge influence in the community moves on others have to rally to fill that enormous void cause he did soooo much for local youth. and I love fishing and often take out the local kids so it just seemed fitting. two of my buddies took over baseball but nobody has got on hockey yet which sucks. I might end up doing that too bit im not sure if time will allow me  anyhow, its a walleye derby but many people also caught their first sturgeons and said it was one of the best derbies they ever attended! and that blew me away being it was the first year!  I also had Elvis brothers band The Nighthawk Band play afterwards so everyone could get their dance on!  we even got donations from weechitiwin family services and had leather jackets embroidered with the tourny logo and those went to his parents which made us all cry when I presented them lol  hopefully we have good ice this year and I might actually move the event to LOTWs because that was his future plan, but who knows?"
883552,adempsey,2014-11-27 15:29:00,1498,I have some stuff I could send your way.   It's not ice fishing gear though.   Will give me an excuse to clean up my fishing gear as well.  PM me the shipping address.
