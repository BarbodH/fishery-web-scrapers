883144,Fisherman,2014-11-26 00:46:00,7201,"Did a quick lap around Cabelas this evening and what do I see..looks like Eskimo flip overs now have a built in smitty sled.  Quite the set up, push down on the hitch and the sled raises for travel and no damage, flip the hitch up and you're on the ice.  But ow ow ow, the price. http://www.cabelas.ca/product/72079/eskimo-flipmo2-inferno-shelter-and-lakerunner-sled-combo"
883240,misfish,2014-11-26 10:56:00,29133,"Ya, It,s been there since they put up the ice fishing stuff.Nice price tag too. If I had a machine,I would concider that thing."
883257,Beavertail,2014-11-26 12:58:00,331,That's the Cadillac for sure....I guess the price reflects that too. Think I'll stick with my $20 homemade (Chrysler K- car) smitty for now.
883280,BillM,2014-11-26 14:43:00,17367,"That's a pretty slick design, although I'd like to see how it fairs after being frozen solid in 4-5inches of slush for a few hours"
883291,manitoubass2,2014-11-26 15:05:00,11391,"$1500 bucks!!!!!  id rather go without lol, thats insane"
883293,Dara,2014-11-26 15:13:00,3052,It weighs 144 lbs empty...and I can't see that it does anything...ferget it..I will stick with lighting a fire and throwing a tarp down

883406,Fisherman,2014-11-26 23:22:00,7201,"Well I just had a quick look, the ski/sled part looked pretty robust, steel skis with UHMW runners.  I suppose things could go wrong,  I usually avoid the slush beds just for that reason."

Not built cheap thats for sure."
883425,irishfield,2014-11-26 23:58:00,26272,Lloyd and I could break it on a good Temagami run... I can guarantee that!!  I'd rather have a hut hull skimming a 2' slush field than skis digging in any day!
883426,Terry,2014-11-27 00:01:00,14456,my clam plows it does not skim  lol
883427,misfish,2014-11-27 00:05:00,29133,"my clam plows it does not skim  lol  Yup,it does."
883428,irishfield,2014-11-27 00:05:00,26272,LOL...
883483,Joeytier,2014-11-27 03:20:00,3990,"Wow, that is a great little rig for sure, but for $1500 I could pick up a great permanent shack.  If it's so cold that I have to be cooped up in a shack (which drives me nuts) I probably won't want to move much anyway!"
