883319,Thrilla,2014-11-26 16:50:00,164,Didn't have a net? Pretty rough handling of a catch and release fish. Nice vertical hold in your avatar LOL
883361,Whalebreath,2014-11-26 18:53:00,15,Some JB Weld judiciously applied should fix that reel then you can keep it for newbies.
883437,FloatnFly,2014-11-27 00:48:00,1640,"have a welder friend fix it up for you.  i broke the reel seat on my dads old cardinal 4 when i was 10 by closing it in a trunk lid......a friend his is a welder, fixed it up, and hes still using that reel today 21 years later"
883439,FloatnFly,2014-11-27 00:49:00,1640,Didn't have a net? Pretty rough handling of a catch and release fish.   shouldn't throw stones in glass houses.  your avatar picture is screaming at me right now
883510,JoshS,2014-11-27 06:13:00,729,"I sent a busted c3 into Abu and they took care of me. Seems to me they have decent service.  As for the reel quality.. I had it rotation for a few years and used it lots until it was demoted. They are not great for pulling big baits for longer then that. For a hundred dollar reel, seems about par. But mine needed new gears or something... Didn't break a reel seat mid fish lol!"
882853,PBenson,2014-11-25 00:29:00,154,  Bill Dance moment haha
882866,chris.brock,2014-11-25 01:11:00,4053,welcome to Team Shimano
882867,PBenson,2014-11-25 01:15:00,154,That's hilarious... I bought the Shimano Calcutta B later that day!
882870,Lape0019,2014-11-25 01:33:00,647,That was a close one! I caught a 44 in her on a 2500 size Stradic CI4 so that just stinks!  I am sure you will enjoy the Calcutta!
882871,Fisherman,2014-11-25 01:34:00,7201,"Ok, so what happened, the screws loosen off on the reel foot or was it maybe a weak spot weld?  I've got an ABU that's brought in countless salmon, almost 20 years old. No problems."
882883,PBenson,2014-11-25 02:27:00,154,"It was the weld that snapped, so maybe weak spot weld."
882886,bigugli,2014-11-25 02:30:00,6138,   Also known to happen on Stradic bail wires.
882900,ccmtcanada,2014-11-25 03:37:00,7971,Does anyone else think their boat looks tiny and made of styrofoam? Lol  Oh yeah....the reel...that just sucks!!!!
882902,mike rousseau,2014-11-25 03:39:00,4661, Yup  Just a rough finish on a small glass boat  Edit... It's actually snow/ice from the looks of it
882903,PBenson,2014-11-25 03:41:00,154,It's a 13 foot Boston Whaler with snow on it.
882904,mike rousseau,2014-11-25 03:42:00,4661,I gotta get on that jig bite...  Looks like you go 0-100 in a flash....  So cool
882924,muskymatt,2014-11-25 12:40:00,2608,"I had the same reel, gears exploded when a 45"" hit boatside. Been with Shimano ever since"
882928,Raf,2014-11-25 13:19:00,3495,"looks like a 5500 series reel?  you brought a knife to a gunfight.  still, the reel should not have snapped like that"
882935,AKRISONER,2014-11-25 13:50:00,5558,i keep seeing videos with guys catching skis in that area. If only i had a travelling boat.  My grandfather landed a 28lb pike the same way lol.
882950,Moosebunk,2014-11-25 14:33:00,3970,"Worm gear went on mine after a few years.  Shimano since with no issues.  Gladly for you though, you still caught the fish.  You don't even need a reel apparently."
882955,lew,2014-11-25 14:45:00,12766,  You don't even need a reel apparently.  TJ boated a huge musky by hand a few years back after his Abu came apart ...hilarious story.
882965,PBenson,2014-11-25 15:32:00,154,Gotta do what Ya gotta do to get the fish in and released safely!
882970,bigbuck,2014-11-25 15:59:00,2449,"I Can't beleive you guys caught that musky there!! Never would have thought to fish for skis there, you could def do it from shore. Btw, that sucks that the reel came apart like that. I would contact Abu, you never know, they may send you a new reel. A Calcutta is the cadillac of musky reels, you will never regret buying it. My TE followed by my Abu Record and then my Curado 300 in that order are my fave reels."
883023,PBenson,2014-11-25 18:57:00,154,I contacted Abu and they said they'd fix it for $30... Not bad to keep it as a spare but I am already in love with the Calcutta haha
883102,esoxansteel,2014-11-25 23:25:00,1307,"Had the same thing happen to me years ago, on a 6500 ABU, the two spot welds broke, had the foot not spot welded, but welded back to the frame, have to remove all parts that dont take heat, ie washers, plastic etc, but it had weld marks on it, and cosmetically looked like crap, but never failed again,    Now its TEs, and Tecota's  no looking back, but still use Revo Toro's though"
883115,Joeytier,2014-11-25 23:49:00,3990,Abu's do not make casting reels like they used to.
883123,lew,2014-11-25 23:54:00,12766,"Now its TEs, and Tecota's  no looking back  Yup, me too Steve, both are excellent reels that work great."
883263,Lunker Larry,2014-11-26 13:19:00,122,Didn't have a net? Pretty rough handling of a catch and release fish.
883266,Gregoire,2014-11-26 13:42:00,1397,"The guy had a broken reel, and did what he could to get a smallish fish into the boat and I am sure released quickly. Check post history before you are critical of someone."
883268,PBenson,2014-11-26 13:44:00,154,"I know, we did have a net but it was just chaos once the reel broke to land the fish. If you look at any of my other videos we always use a net and unhook the fish in the water. Just a crazy situation. We normally use the Frabill Big Kahuna."
