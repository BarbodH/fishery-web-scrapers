883891,Mr.Topwater!,2014-11-29 02:18:00,81,Hi. I'm new here. I just retired and I'm looking for 1 man thermal hut.  Light and simple flip over style. Easy to pull.Any good and bad experiences ? $500 max.Thanks.
883902,sleepjigging,2014-11-29 03:17:00,207,I have only used pop-ups. Love them.  How will you deal with the weight of the flip-overs? Getting it on and off your vehicle?  Sleepjigging
883911,Mr.Topwater!,2014-11-29 03:41:00,81,"I owned a pop up once. It acted like a parachute. I'm only 57 so the weight should be okay. I'm leaning to the clam legend thermal. One more question, Sleepjigger.  Are the thermals good enough to be heated with just a candle? Probably a stupid question. Thanks a lot."

If you are going to be hand pulling you will want to build yourself a Smitty Sled to make the job easier. You are not going to heat them with a candle unfortunately but they do hold the heat better and will also cut down on the dripping off the roof. I don't have dripping problems as it's too freaking cold!!!! I end up with frost over almost the entire inside of my non-insulated 2 man hut.
