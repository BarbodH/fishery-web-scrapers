882392,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-22 16:56:00,2582, Not sure what you mean by 78s?  I think they are 10 inch if that's what you mean? Almost certain they would be 78's Joey.
882403,Terry,2014-11-22 17:32:00,14456,"10"" were 78s    quit making them around 1960 12"" were 33 1/3 7"" were 45s"
882410,wkrp,2014-11-22 17:44:00,656,I have been listening to  nothing but zoomer radio AM 740. Great old nostalgic programming.
882433,Joey,2014-11-22 18:44:00,9122,"Okay, then they are 10's"
882437,misfish,2014-11-22 18:51:00,29133,I have been listening to nothing but zoomer radio AM 740. Great old nostalgic programming.  They play great oldies. I thought I was the only one here.LOL  Sitting here watching and listening to Jersey Boys movie.
882438,lew,2014-11-22 18:57:00,12766, They play great oldies. I thought I was the only one here.LOL   My truck radio is tuned to Sirius 50's rock and very seldom ever comes off it.

882571,Beans,2014-11-23 14:45:00,3339,"This is my all-time favorite instrumental...  ""Slaughter on Tenth Avenue"" from ""West Side Story""   "
882912,John Bacon,2014-11-25 06:03:00,3277," I can just imagine all the young guys on this board wondering what the heck records are  Actually, vinyl records are making a comeback.  They will still be around long after kids have no idea what a CD is.   10"" were 78s    quit making them around 1960 12"" were 33 1/3 7"" were 45s  And the 78s could only hold about  three and half minutes per side.  So if a musician wanted to release a group of songs he would release an album containing several discs.  The 12 inch 33 1/3 aka LP (long play) could hold all of the songs that previously required an album on to one disc.   These were still referred to as albums even though they fit on a single record; or, a single CD."
882952,bigugli,2014-11-25 14:36:00,6138,"I had quite the album collection before we downsized. Over a thousand LP's primarily from the 60's and 70's. When we moved to the apartment, there was no room for all of that."
883706,Joey,2014-11-28 02:38:00,9122,"We still have a milk crate of old albums (78's I assume), the big ones. David Bowie etc.  the old stuff. And in fact a turntable if you can believe it"
883708,Terry,2014-11-28 02:47:00,14456,David Bowie should be 33 1/3
883711,Joey,2014-11-28 02:57:00,9122,"Well, see know nothing about size, I just know it works"
883713,limeyangler,2014-11-28 03:16:00,5204,This one is a classic…….    
883715,bigugli,2014-11-28 03:21:00,6138,"Hey Simon, around 1972, a rather obscure group, the RSDG, had a major hit on both sides of the pond. Not so uncommon in the British Isles but it caught everybody off guard on this side of the ocean.  The album was ""Farewell To The Greys"""
882209,Joey,2014-11-21 20:05:00,9122,"Was on hold today and this way playing, anyone remember it?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeHgNqbdBKs"
882214,Bill Shearer,2014-11-21 20:23:00,456,One of the better acousticals of the day. Been many years since I've heard it. Thanks for shaking the memory tree.
882216,Terry,2014-11-21 20:41:00,14456,yup always loved that song
882219,jimmer,2014-11-21 20:43:00,2730,"Wow, I haven't heard that in years. Thanks for bringing back some old memories. I also listened to the version by Sungha Jung. Just a kid, but quite impressive."
882232,Bill Shearer,2014-11-21 21:35:00,456,"Probably too long ago for 90% of the folks here. Another acoustical you should search out is the Deliverence song ""dueling banjos"" An original Flatt and Scruggs tune. Awesome IMO."
882247,Joey,2014-11-21 22:25:00,9122,"Probably too long ago for 90% of the folks here. Another acoustical you should search out is the Deliverence song ""dueling banjos"" An original Flatt and Scruggs tune. Awesome IMO.  Love that too, but the movie brings back strange memories from when I first saw it, but thank you for posting that, I loved it"
882250,misfish,2014-11-21 22:31:00,29133,"Now thats a classic and one of the best.  Ya the movie was a bit,but the playing was very good.  "
882253,Bernie,2014-11-21 22:49:00,3190,Always liked this one. 
882256,glen,2014-11-21 23:18:00,2641,Link didn't work for me.  Try this one. 
882257,misfish,2014-11-21 23:20:00,29133,Theres also this one. Took me a while to find the name  
882258,lew,2014-11-21 23:23:00,12766,"Bernie, ""A Summer Place"" is my all time favorite instrumental.  Really a beautiful tune to listen to."
882262,misfish,2014-11-21 23:31:00,29133,"Glen, thats the one I always remember hearing.  Thanks"
882270,bigugli,2014-11-22 00:02:00,6138,"I still have the original album.  There was some really unique and different stuff all thrown into the one album. last tune was called Sunflower. He also liked to dabble in other artistic medium, not unlike Andy Warhol, having produced a book of poetry and a ""different"" photography portfolio. I had a signed copy of the poetry book, years  back, sold for a pretty penny. His daytime job was as a TV writer."
882287,npt1,2014-11-22 01:29:00,220,"Hi Bernie,  Loved the Theme From A Summer Place song. Brings back memories from the past. Kids today may think they are the chosen  ones but we know better.  Sad to say for the kids of today that  the music of what they know, and that rap is only  missing the letter ''c'' that should go in front of it, and listen to will be ''the good old days for them''.  Very sad for them because they missed the best--50's and 60's."
882309,Joey,2014-11-22 04:14:00,9122,"Actually, when dad passed away, I got a booklet of about 12 vinal albums of Stan Kenton and his orchestra.  I'm gonna hang on to them for awhile , but there are at least 30 of them.  As in 12 albums of vinal discs."
882310,Joey,2014-11-22 04:19:00,9122,"That didn't explain it very well, so he he kept them all in a vinal container, with about 12 albums each, all separated and in excellent condition, in about 3 containers"
882312,Joey,2014-11-22 04:30:00,9122,"There are at least 15 vinyl albums in each folder, all in A1 condtition.   Kinda cool   If you're into Stan Kenton that is  IMG_0192 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr"
882313,Joey,2014-11-22 04:34:00,9122,"He also kept all the newspapers from when JFK was killed and I have those too, in mind condition"

Kinda cool   If you're into Stan Kenton that is  IMG_0192 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr  Are those 78s?  I think that is where the term 'album' (for music recordings) orginated.  Then when LPs became popular, what used to require an album could be recorded on one disc."
882317,bigugli,2014-11-22 05:09:00,6138,"Instrumental music was big in the 60's. Something far too complex for today's youth apparently??? A Canadian great was ""Walk Don't Run"" by the Ventures. They would also record the hawaii 50 theme. Anybody remember Paul Marat's ""Love Is Blue"" How about ""Telstar"" Must not forget Duane Eddy."
882329,wormdunker,2014-11-22 08:33:00,1711,"bigugli - now you really got me thinking! LOL! Paul Mariat, Bobby Vinton?  I do remember the Hawaii 50 theme and many more!  I was in the disc jockey business in Niagara for over 30 years.  We used to own Party Sounds Disc Jockey Service. Club Capri was a regular venue for me."

Bruce,my folks loved Duane Eddy.  So much so my brother's first and middle names are Duane Edward. I don't remember any of the music but I do remember seeing Duane Eddy, Ventures & Telstar album covers. Wonder if they still have any of the old vinyl kicking around?"
