You are 14 so you don't have a whole lot to lose! you won't get rich with the product you plan on carrying, but if you put the time in, you may be able to make it work by the time you finish school.  The other end of it (which is what I would tell my son) is you are 14. It is time to be a kid and enjoy life because it passes by quickly. You have plenty of time to have a career and not a lot of time being a kid. Enjoy it! I have 1 tackle shop I frequent. The owner has one of the premier shops in my area and it is 900 square feet and he does quite well. what most don't see is that for him to turn a profit, he and his wife have to work 10-15 hour days which doesn't leave a whole lot of time to fish.  You have to figure out what your priorities are. I would bet you could make more money working part time at your age than what your business will bring in within the next year so I would go work part time and save your money to try a start up after a few years."

I'd have to fish with you first and see if I wanted to throw you out of the boat... lol  I had about three real teachers in highschool, the rest of the ""teachers"" were just there because they couldn't make it in the real world and liked summers off.  As for Creditmaster.. he has some serious drive and a dream... and the best school of hard knocks may very well be for him to try.. fall down and then dust himself off. I know that works pretty well..."

Creditmaster - I like your commitment and work ethic. Your generation is so tech savvy - why not sell online if u r going to specialize in less product? wow us young uns have somthing to learn ................... i never thought of that   great idea cause i get my stuff derectly from the china producer at next to nothing  i can just sell online ???????!!!!!!  thanks landry"
882878,landry,2014-11-25 02:11:00,1005,"Ha - fair enough IrishField. I teach grade six and I am very dedicated. Not all teachers are dedicated but most are - just like any profession I suppose. I do not agree with the ""rest can't make it in the real world"" comment though but I am sure there are some who fit that description and who only do it for the summers off. I have I no respect for the few teachers I know that role that way. Actually, I have no respect for lazy people in general, regardless of their profession. Happy fishing:)"

882896,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-25 03:08:00,956,Lots of good advice for you here creditmaster.  Best of luck to you
883009,hookerdown,2014-11-25 18:07:00,110,"Creditmaster, I had the same dream as you did when I was younger (44 now).  In highschool I focused on business classes with the thought of owning a fishing store.   I did what I could to learn about running a business, including taking a ton of accounting classes.  I took co-op in grade 12 and worked in a sporting goods store that had a fishing section, which I helped turn around and made it one of the most profitable sections in the store.  At Humber, I studied Marketing, once again with the thought of running a tackle shop.  In one of my classes I had to create a business plan, which was for a tackle shop.  I selected a real life location (irronically there have been 2 tackles shops in the same location since then).  I also did a case study on Shimano Canada and interviewed the Sales Manager.  After I finished college, I ended up working at a well known fishing retailer in Mississauga.  While working there, I quickly figured out, running a bricks and motar tackle shop requires a lot time and energy, and it could take 20 years to build the business in order to make some good coin if you can make the business survive it that long.  I have talked to many guys who ran traditional tackle shops and online retailers and its a tough go regardless.  As well, you will find that you would be lucky to go fishing at all while running a tackle shop.  You are very lucky, you are young and you have the ears of many people here that had/have the same dream as you.   Learn from our mistakes and successes.  Even when you are old like us, don't regret trying (no matter how far along you got).  If I had to do it again, I would still take the same courses again, with a few changes but I would remain more focused on learning and create projects that I could have used to help me start up a tackle shop.   In this day and age, you can make a lot of connections easily to help you with your dream.  Take a few business classes while in highschool, and do a few projects based on opening a tackle shop, that way you can build on what you learn and reach that dream.    In today's current market, I personally would focus on a speciality or two, and concentrate on satisfiying the market as best as you can.  By providing a few hard to get or custom items along with some staples you would have a great start.  Sorry for being long winded but I had to chime in."
883043,creditmaster,2014-11-25 20:51:00,190,thanks evreyone for the advice and suppor.t i will get into the online business and i will post when it is open hope you all will support  thanks
883130,ah_long,2014-11-26 00:13:00,354,"I strongly suggest you to work @ a tackle store and talk to existing owners.  The business is not as good as you think, and I hate to burst your bubble, it's almost impossible to be a price leader in the industry with your current buying power. (Think LeBaron)  Distributors will also take a cut from you unless you can rack up a large order to go direct."
883136,FloatnFly,2014-11-26 00:35:00,1640,"There are cost associated with running an online shop as well, unless you're an expert web page designer, you'll have to pay for that, you'll have to pay a yearly fee for the domain name, you'll need a place to store products that are awaiting shipping.  If you';re buying cheap stuff from China, word will get around quickly that you're selling cheap gear, and people won't shop there.  It doesn't have to be the most expensive, but buy reputable, brand name, quality, proven gear.  You start with a quality product, backed by good customer service, it will bring you return customers.  I would also STRONGLY recommend talking to Mike over at Fishheads Canada, hes the owner of the business, its an online retail business, his bread and butter is his roe sales.  talk to him, and he'll give you an idea of what its like, hes a young guy as well, not 14 but i would put him around 30"

882360,creditmaster,2014-11-22 14:38:00,190,yeah? it would start small though not more than 50 diffrent items

882374,landry,2014-11-22 15:15:00,1005,Great location. My belief is that starting small will lead to imminent failure - when I go in a store with limited stock I typically do not return.
882376,creditmaster,2014-11-22 15:30:00,190,Great location. My belief is that starting small will lead to imminent failure - when I go in a store with limited stock I typically do not return. yeah but by prices would be up to 35 percent cheaper than any other place and t  would be the only one in the area AND right on the credit with acces to the river
882381,DOS,2014-11-22 15:53:00,119,"Good luck, it can be tough. And be prepared to have no spare time at all.  Your fishing adventures will be the ones your customers share with you,  LOL.  I am 4 years into my adventure and I will tell you customer service is much more important than cheaper prices. 90% of my stock is cheaper than BP or CTC and all the big box stores but customers are always under the impression that because I am a 'mom and pop' shop that i am more expensive.  They come in because I truly care about people, treat it the same and you will do well.  Good luck  Dan"
882389,landry,2014-11-22 16:50:00,1005,"I think Dan nailed it as he has been there and done that. If y own a store you will fish very little.  If you love to fish then: - don't get married - don't have kids - get a seasonal job or work a shift like a continental shift - keep your living expenses low so u can drive, fly and fish whenever u r off work. I have broken all of those guiding rules BUT I Still love my life. Of course, because I have a serious addiction, I still wish I could fish more:) Landry"
882408,creditmaster,2014-11-22 17:40:00,190,lol i agree no plas to have kids ......................only a wife  but i live on the credit so i can walk out on my balcony and throw  a line for some steel
882427,James77,2014-11-22 18:30:00,175,"Take this as you will but I think hockey is a very similar industry and I've been in the retail end for years. People looking for cheap prices will 100% shop online. Have you looked into the mark up on the things you are thinking of selling? At our store if we did everything at 35% off we would break even but lose on our expenses. I'm not sure if fishing is the same but the amount of expenses that are involved is immense. You never really want to start small. If someone walks in looking for something and you don't have it, the odds of them ever making another trip is gone. You need to analyze where the money can be made, and you need to specialize in certain areas. You 100% can not cover every aspect of fishing without a store 2000 sqft+. You'd be looking at $2000 as a minimum rent and your profit has to be able to support it.  For hockey, there are $30 sticks and there are $300 sticks, we specialize in the $150-300 range. The reason being is that every Canadian Tire and Sport Chek has the lower end stuff at great prices, so why compete with them? For fishing if people are looking for cheap stuff they will go online, or they will head to Canadian Tire. You need to figure out your specialty, service your customers well, and provide them with knowledge they wouldn't find at Canadian Tire or Bass Pro.  I've been thinking of opening a shop in the Kawartha area for a while now but I don't have the expertise needed to accurately sell everything.  James"
882436,creditmaster,2014-11-22 18:50:00,190,i see...................... ok thenks
882490,John Bacon,2014-11-22 23:24:00,3277,Were you planning to operate out of your home?  That would almost certainly be a by-law infraction.  By-laws are usually enforced on a complaint basis so you may be fine if nobody complains.  But it only takes one person to notify the city that you are running a retail operation out of your home to have the city on your back.  Have you actually researched the feasibilty of selling for 35% less than your competitors?  You need to know what your purchase price is going to be before you can decide that you are going to sell items for 35% less than the competition.
882499,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-23 00:02:00,956,Your only 14 years old so I'm going to be honest as possible with you buddy.  Drop the idea and focus on getting a good education.

If you sell $1000 a day your only making $50.... Then you have to pay for your overhead...  And if you think you can afford employees your way out in left field....  If you sell $1000 a day... wich you won't... Nothing personnel but I don't think many shops sell $1000 a day... You could pay 1 employee $5 per hour (under minimum wage) for a 10 hour day... Again assuming you have zero overhead...  At the end of the day you have nothing...
