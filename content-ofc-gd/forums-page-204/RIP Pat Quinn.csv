882788,John,2014-11-24 19:32:00,2956,LOL I was reading about Quinn and chatting to my son about Burns..you guys will be old eventually...
882820,esoxansteel,2014-11-24 22:15:00,1307,"A true legend, when Quinn coached the leafs, and was doing drills on the ice, Darcy Tucker went up the ice with his head down, Quinn assumed Tucker new he was there, and that he would move out of the way, but he didnt, and ran into Quinn, and layed on the ice knocked out counting sheep, after he woke up Tucker said hitting Quinn was the hardest thing he has ever hit, and categorized it as like running into a train. Bobby Orr also took a few heavy hits from Quinn as well.  RIP   Quinn and Burnsie my 2 favorite coaches of all time"

883296,Toronto_Angler,2014-11-26 15:29:00,698,"Had the pleasure of working with him for 6 years at the Leafs. Great man, would treat everyone the same no matter if you were Mats Sundin or the guy who changed the garbage bags."
