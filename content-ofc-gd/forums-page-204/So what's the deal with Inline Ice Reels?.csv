882162,Terry,2014-11-21 16:33:00,14456,Well some said just keep adding swivels to stop line twist. Most do not like a swivel above their float and up to 5 swivels. And I think most agreed it was simpler just to learn how to cast it right   But keep trying.
882166,manitoubass2,2014-11-21 16:43:00,11391,"I use one barrel swivel about 16"" up while ice fishing. straight 8lb fluoro.  works for me very well.  Id like to try these reels though. no reason not to try  I generally only fish as deep as 30 fow though so maybe there is a difference there.  on the river its a 3/8oz jig or drop shotting or you will get insane line twist from the current alone"
882181,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-21 17:49:00,2582,"I have always had a swivel about 16 inches up my line. A jigging rap dropped down to 25 feet will spin for maybe 10 seconds tops before it settles down the way I rig. Never had any problems but I don't fish deep either. For perch/bluegills I actually think the swivel is an added attractant.  Fishing shallow and looking down the hole I couldn't tell you the number of times I will have 3 or 4 bigger perch all eyeballing  and even hitting my swivel, especially on those tough days when they are not aggressive.  I would still like to give the inlines a try though...but I have not seen any in my area that are made for lefties?"
882185,irishfield,2014-11-21 18:25:00,26272,Steve you can buy the black betty 6061 in left or right hand.
882191,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-21 18:38:00,2582,Thx Wayne..last two seasons checking out inlines in the oshawa area I have not seen any lefties. Maybe they have the black betty this year...don't really need anything so I haven't been in a local tackle store for quite awhile.
882194,SirCranksalot,2014-11-21 18:47:00,3291,I think I'll pass on those---that way I'll have yet another excuse why I didn't catch any!!

And I think most agreed it was simpler just to learn how to cast it right But keep trying.  Wasn't the whole premise of line twist while ice fishing being detrimental to the action of the lure?  ie the jig spinning by itself.  Steelhead don't care if you have line twist, and no one will ever convince me that the Wallis cast is worth the effort, lol.   Now if there's a correlation between casting style and fish on the bank, I'm all ears."

882294,landry,2014-11-22 01:49:00,1005,"If fishing very light and tiny  jigs for panfish, then I believe that an inline reel does reduce jig spin.in clear water it appears to me that most fish prefer a non spinning jig. Of course if u quiver your hig it will hold it's positions too. I fish both types of reels and the inline wins for light stuff but it is best in 20' or less."
882296,BillM,2014-11-22 02:07:00,17367," Bill,got a pic of that jig?  Similar to this, you can also get them in a darter head without the eyes.   Super strong hook, I love them.  "

882352,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-22 14:01:00,2582,"Just a new toy to play with. I'm under no illusion that I will actually catch more perch. I'm hoping the bigger reel will also eliminate some of the icing up problems I get with some of my small ice fishing reels. On a side note a reel failed on me at the cottage this spring so I went to Lindsay and bought the cheapest Lew's spinning reel they had to get me through my weeks vacation up there. It has become a new favourite. I'm looking forward to how it performs in the cold. Very impressed with it so far. My next reel purchase will probably be another Lew's spinning reel, but I'll upgrade to one of there more expensive models."

882064,Dan668,2014-11-21 01:01:00,1120,Yep.  I wouldnt consider the bb because of the lack of free spool and lower gear ratio

882095,EC1,2014-11-21 05:11:00,930,"Let's put it this way - The marketing of in-line reels finally made it into the mainstream in Ontario last year. The inline reels today are finally updating their technology to have a decent drag, free spool, and other features that I may not be familiar with. Not to say that these are bad reels nor am I bashing on those that own one. You've simply bought yourself a new tool that has great potential to catch a ton of fish.  Having never owned one, I won't go into comparing. I will say what I can visually see in a fish tank with a spinning reel on a tungsten jig and small plastic with a small swivel a foot above. When doing small jigging motions (1"" to 3""), the tail of my bait may have a range of 60° to 90° of rotation. (360° being a full circle). On a bigger jig (9"" to 1'), the tail may go 180° to 360° after it lands but I have yet to have witnessed my jigs spin wildly with the swivel above.  More power to you if you feel that you can do better with an inline, but I will stick with my spinning reels. I do believe that the best ice (pan)fishermen are the ones with a precise presentation along with one other trait that we'll discuss another day"
882103,Terry,2014-11-21 10:23:00,14456,"a foot of line out will not have reel line twist with spinning reels, let say those 500 icefishing reels many use has 3"" of line per rap , so because of the way it falls off the reel you get 4 twist per foot   100 ft of line out and you have 400 twists , before you start jigging in line reel you get zero twist just like a baitcaster their is a post about the wallis cast with a pin reel, the guys were all saying the only way to get rid of twist others said they could stop using swivels using the wallis cast which lets the line strait out rather then the side cast that has the line come off like a spinning reel I have hours and hours of underwater camera viewing in shallow and deep water and I have seen a jig sit and spin for 5 minutes without any jigging, Lloyd from this forum the charter boat guy is the very best fisherman I know and will bet 30 or more people here will agree. he uses them."

882144,EC1,2014-11-21 15:46:00,930,"We've just put 400 twists and 100' of line in a reel that I believe most people claim impractical after about 25-30' when fishing. I'm not a pin fisherman at all, but then didn't we just somewhat agree that a swivel fixes (some/most) line twist problems?  Remember when fluoro was marketed as the only thing you should use because of its invisibility, no stretch etc? I might be missing some benefits of an inline, but I'm having a hard time being swayed that it is the end-all to ice fishing.  Let's just all be friends and go out and have a great ice season whatever your reel preferences are. I'm sure we could go days about how a jig that's dropped too fast to a fish will spook it, or a slower descent will make you miss suspended cruisers. Maybe I'll see the benefits when I get my butt handed to me fishing next to one sometime this season."
882146,Terry,2014-11-21 15:47:00,14456,I just bought a 101 minnkota ilink and hummingbird  895 finder. Can't hook it up till spring.    Toys are us
881913,Sharkbait22,2014-11-20 16:04:00,297,Never held one or seen one.  Seem to be catching on  ... the latest thing.  Anyone know the pros and cons based on reading or first-hand experience?
881918,Joeytier,2014-11-20 16:29:00,3990,Eliminates line twist...great for ultralite fishing (1/8 and under) plus it's a lot of fun to fight fish on them.  Pain in the rear for for deepwater fishing since you have to pull the line out manually.
881927,irishfield,2014-11-20 17:02:00,26272,The Black Betty 6061 will free spool a 1/16th ounce bait with no issues... in a heated hut of course.
881934,Fisherman,2014-11-20 17:26:00,7201,"Pain in the rear for for deepwater fishing since you have to pull the line out manually. Why?  2.77:1 return , not the fastest but at least you don't have a birds nest between your feet on the ice."
881938,kickingfrog,2014-11-20 17:36:00,8333,"Reeling a standard reel from ""deep"" water can be a pain  so yes these wouldn't be my first choice for 80ish feet and beyond. Pros and cons as with most things."
881939,Joeytier,2014-11-20 17:43:00,3990,"The one i had used did not freespool, so yes it was a pain in deep water to strip out 2 feet at a time"
881946,Sinker,2014-11-20 18:31:00,8692,Just the next thing to look cool IMO.  Can't beat a good spinning or casting reel.  S.

881964,kickingfrog,2014-11-20 20:01:00,8333,Nope. Why take 2 minutes to do something that can be done in 20 seconds? More time with your bait fishin'... and it's more like a 150-200 cranks with many of the low ratio reels.
881972,irishfield,2014-11-20 20:41:00,26272,"2.7 to 1 on the black betty 6061 is 19"" of line per turn... so 50 cranks from 80 feet.  The big thing with the inline vs a spinning reel... is bait presentation. Not a big deal if you're whipping a spoon up and down, but if you're still fishing a small 1/16th to 1/4 oz jig / bait the inline puts it down and it sits natural and still. 80 feet down on a spinning reel and at least in my case that bait is going round and round and round and may or may not scare the fish off.  I'll put my thoughts to work this winter... I plan to fish one spinning and one inline and we'll see which wins."

881985,misfish,2014-11-20 21:23:00,29133,Just make sure you put the line on the right way.  Just saying   I find the Black Betty a bit over priced for what it is. JMO

882000,Sharkbait22,2014-11-20 22:06:00,297,"Thanks for the replies.  I was more curious than anything.  Irishfield raise a good point, line twist happens for me quite a bit with some baits e,g, tube jig even with a in-line swivel.  I've noticed it most when I put the line just in the hole in plain view and sometimes when looking down the hole. Often wondered what a fish makes of the spinning lure. But this is more about the type of lure and not the reel.  The same twisting would happen on the in-line reel."
882016,BillM,2014-11-20 22:44:00,17367,"The spin also has to do with the lure itself, not the line.  All tube jigs will spiral..  I haven't seen one that drops straight yet (Unless it weighs something silly like 1-2oz)"

My line ends up twisted just like in Brian's pic. Not a problem if you are actively jigging. Do you use a swivel Brian or a straight uni to uni flow briad knot?  I've been thinking of using a longer floro leader this winter, like 10ft plus 8lbs test."
