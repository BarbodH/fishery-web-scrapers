883449,Fisherman,2014-11-27 01:41:00,7201,Does the trailer have a braking system could be dragging He said it has surge brakes.
883451,BillM,2014-11-27 01:45:00,17367,"Makes sense for sure, I'll be taking the boat off in the spring and doing some measuring myself, but not before letting them know now that the problem persists.  No need to take the boat off, jack up the trailer with the boat on and put it on stands.  You can move the axle around all you want if it's up in the air.  Shouldn't take you more then 5 mins to see if there's a problem with the alignment."
883452,irishfield,2014-11-27 01:48:00,26272,You still haven't told us how the tires are wearing Matt ! Edges chewed... entire tread worn... bald spots?  Bald spots = your brakes locking up.
883563,Terry,2014-11-27 16:12:00,14456,I have seen light trailer wheels lock right up at high speeds with brakes having a tire come to a dead stop at 100km can wear  it a bit too   You still haven't told us how the tires are wearing Matt ! Edges chewed... entire tread worn... bald spots?  Bald spots = your brakes locking up.  without photos it is all just guess work
883567,muskymatt,2014-11-27 16:57:00,2608,"Both inside and outside edges worn smooth, center still has lots of tread.    "
883570,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-27 17:07:00,10439,Under inflated Matt.  Check the PSI rating on the sidewall of the tire and inflate to that pressure. My snowmobile tires are 55 PSI and my popup camper tires are 65 PSI. Under inflating wears the outside edges while over inflating will wear out the middle.
883573,Terry,2014-11-27 17:13:00,14456,yup under
883576,muskymatt,2014-11-27 17:21:00,2608,Under inflated Matt.  Check the PSI rating on the sidewall of the tire and inflate to that pressure. My snowmobile tires are 55 PSI and my popup camper tires are 65 PSI. Under inflating wears the outside edges while over inflating will wear out the middle. I would agree except that I hit the Shell every trip to fill to 55psi religiously! This is what's bothering me is that I'm anal about that(and dissing the laffs) and see no reason for the wear.
883577,DanD,2014-11-27 17:37:00,2223,Then the tire may not be of the proper load range for the weight its asked to carry. With the max pressure of 55psi the tire is likely a C or D range which are 6 and 8 ply tires; I would switch up to an E range rated tire that are a 10 ply which has an 80psi max psi. Most trailer manufacturers will install the most economical tire they can that still falls legally into that weight class of trailer.  Dan.
883578,glen,2014-11-27 18:41:00,2641,Tread odd.  Trailer tire?

That may be the fix it, although my last trailer and the one that replaced this had C rated and were fine for like 8 years lol"
883580,muskymatt,2014-11-27 18:58:00,2608,Tread odd. Trailer tire? Yes but just actually took a closer look and saw this...???  I guess they are not C rated??? Does say trailer use only!  
883584,Roy,2014-11-27 19:14:00,13728,"The ""ST"" stands for ""special trailer""."
883585,aplumma,2014-11-27 19:25:00,6896,Over weight on the tire if they are not under inflated. Notify the dealer in writing as well as photos till the issue is solved.    Art
883589,RickOnt,2014-11-27 19:39:00,669,"Hi Matt  My  trailer, now 3 years old, In its first year  Had the same tire wear problem.  The wheel was wobbling.  If you jack up the trailer and put a screwdriver on a couple of 2x6's, With the end of the screwdriver just touching the side wall. Give the wheel a spin and see if it turns true.  On mine one wheel was wobbling about 3/8"" and the other about 1/4""  I was sure I had bent rims But I had very few miles on trailer and had not hit anything or bounced over any curbs.  I called the dealer but of course he said I must of hit something or the axle is bent.  I did a lot of measuring and took pics and videos.  But he was not satisfied and wanted a tire dealer to say the rims were bent,  I took the wheels off and went to McKee Tire here in Innisfil The tech put them on the balance machine and right away said it was the tires themselves and not the rims.  There were belts or whatever broken in the tire causing the wobble and wear.  After a call from McKee My tires were replaced by the dealer free of charge  Something to look at  Cheers Rick"
883143,muskymatt,2014-11-26 00:44:00,2608,Does anyone know of a condition that a trailer would have the tires wear unevenly and in a single season.   They already changed the tires once and then upgraded the weight class of the axle and it still does it.  Baffled!
883145,Terry,2014-11-26 00:47:00,14456,under inflated over inflated bent axle
883147,muskymatt,2014-11-26 00:49:00,2608,"under inflated over inflated bent axle I keep my tires at the exact psi rating religiously! Axle is new. That's what's weird about it. Everything seems to be fine, except the wear"
883148,Fisherman,2014-11-26 00:52:00,7201,"What do you mean uneven wear?  Tread bare on the outer edges,  inner edges, flat spotting,  scalping, etc.  Like what Terry said, although if they changed the axle, then the spring mounts on the frame may not be the same spacing from the front (or rear) causing one tire to be more forward than the other.   Possibly the surge brakes aren't set up right."
883149,Bondar,2014-11-26 00:52:00,817,Is the axle mounted straight?
883150,irishfield,2014-11-26 00:53:00,26272,Slow down on the way to the fishing hole... you're not supposed to have the trailer drifting through the corners!!
883151,Fisherman,2014-11-26 00:53:00,7201,"Is the axle mounted straight? Haha, you have to type faster."
883152,Terry,2014-11-26 00:57:00,14456,I have seen light trailer wheels lock right up at high speeds with brakes having a tire come to a dead stop at 100km can wear  it a bit too
883159,Entropy,2014-11-26 01:14:00,747,Is the tire rated for the right load?
883160,Entropy,2014-11-26 01:15:00,747,"maybe go from load range D to E, or the similar."
883162,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-26 01:23:00,10439,Can't really say anything without pics of the tires so we can see what type of wear issues you are having Matt.
883244,Sinker,2014-11-26 12:07:00,8692,What drifter said....^  S.
883246,Big Cliff,2014-11-26 12:25:00,6899,If the axle isn't straight with the frame I would expect to see wear on the outside edge of the leading tire and on the inside edge of the trailing tire. Get someone to follow you while going down the highway and see if the trailer is tracking straight.
883247,muskymatt,2014-11-26 12:27:00,2608,I'll post some pics today. I have to assume they are the right class due to a dealership selling me the trailer package.
883251,Fisherman,2014-11-26 12:36:00,7201,"Ha, some dealers will put on day old timmmys donuts, just to get you off the lot."
883252,Sinker,2014-11-26 12:36:00,8692,A 20ft boat on a single axle has to be pushing its limits. Whats the axle rated for?
883255,BillM,2014-11-26 12:53:00,17367,"Tires will wear out in no time if the axle isn't aligned properly or bent, ask me how I know this"
883267,Terry,2014-11-26 13:43:00,14456,"Yeah really quick I bent my axle on the end of a boat ramp. Did not know it bent 8 km down the road blew a tire, saw the other one was all but worn out and saw the bent axle I had 2 spares with me and about 6 more km to get home changed the flat one , then the other one went I then drove with the bad tire in the gravel on the side of the road. Sure made a dust storm The left side tire blew with about  half a km left. I stuffed rags in the tire and slowly made it the rest of the way home  Thanks Brian for bending my axle strait again"
883270,BillM,2014-11-26 13:48:00,17367,"Terry similar thing happened to us..  Must have tweaked the axle down here before a trip to Atikokan.    Got there noticed really abnormal wear on the tires, didn't really clue into it to be honest, I thought maybe the tires were messed up.   Finally had a brain fart just outside of the Sault on 17, pulled over did some measurements and we were a 1/4in out.   Made it just south of Parry Sound before the tire blew taking out the plastic fender and marker light with it.  Luckily I had CAA + RV, got the boat on a flat bed and back to Coldwater.   Pulled the axle brought it into a shop and had it straightened.  I'm a lot more cautious when loading/unloading the boat now, it didn't take much to bend that axle when putting the boat in (high sided it on a rock at one of the launches we use all the time).."
883272,doubleheader,2014-11-26 13:56:00,497,Is the axle mounted straight? This is my guess given your comments on tire maintenance.
883302,bigbuck,2014-11-26 15:40:00,2449,Definitely not tracking like it should. Either the suspension OR the axle is the culprit. Take it to a trailer shop to get checked out and repaired properly.
883326,fish_fishburn,2014-11-26 17:09:00,1311,I think they call it dog tracking. When your axle isn't 90 degrees to the tongue.
883331,ecmilley,2014-11-26 17:15:00,2163,Leaf springs or torsion axle? Get out tape measure measure ball to each side of axle and mounting on frame give u  ball park idea
