883691,Dave Jones,2014-11-28 01:46:00,50,I am going to buy my little grandson a reel for Christmas this year and was wondering if anyone could recommend a good quality spin cast reel.  Thanks
883696,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-28 02:16:00,10439,Here are a couple that get good reviews. Zebco has been around forever in the spincast reel market. The Omega Pro has some pretty good reviews: http://www.basspro.com/Zebco-Omega-Pro-Spincast-Reel/product/10210694/ The BPS Extreme also has some good reviews and looks pretty cool too. Unfortunately it's only available in right had retrieve unlike the Zebco which is convertible left or right. http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Extreme-Spincast-Reel/product/1209270506431/  There are also some decent offerings from Shakesphere and Diawa.
883707,Burtess,2014-11-28 02:44:00,901,I started my kids on Johnson Tangle Free 10 reels.  They have a clutch in them that will not allow the line winder (or pin thing-a-majig) to turn when they are snagged or a fish is pulling and taking line.... thus no line twist.  You know how little kids will just reel like crazy when they have a snag or a fish on!!  Other spin cast reels will twist line like crazy. The last place I saw them was at Walmart.  You can find them on ebay though (I bought two red ones on there).  Both are TF10's.... I don't really know which is older but I think the red one is. Burt
883863,Dave Jones,2014-11-29 00:47:00,50,Thanks Drifter.  Omega Pro it is ! The little guy hasn't figure out if he is left or right handed yet.
883872,Burtess,2014-11-29 01:06:00,901,"They are cheap but before you buy the ""expensive"" spincaster.... you need to look into the TangleFree.... I promise you, it will save you and your grandson a world of twists and tangles.... no other spincaster compares  Burt"
883897,Dave Jones,2014-11-29 02:52:00,50,OK  I will check Walmart first then.  Thanks
