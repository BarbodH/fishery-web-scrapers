883106,BillM,2014-11-25 23:28:00,17367,"Those have gotta be photoshopped, no way Lew ever stepped foot out on a frozen lake  :)"
883111,SirCranksalot,2014-11-25 23:44:00,3291,I'm going to ice fish in The North West Territories this year.  Ssshh---don't be giving away spots!!!

883141,Fisherman,2014-11-26 00:43:00,7201," Instead of watching bowling, you watch one of these lew Well if I had to stare at one of ""those"" things, I'd go bowling too,"
883855,Rizzo,2014-11-29 00:37:00,4754,probably nowhere...and I will remind my wife repeatedly of that...so when its musky season again she won't have a problem with me getting out a few extra  times!
883873,Blue Lk,2014-11-29 01:07:00,337,I'm with Lew on this one. My ice fishing will be fishing some cubes out of the freezer to put in a glass of Forty Creek
883876,wormdunker,2014-11-29 01:14:00,1711,I'm hoping Lake Erie will freeze over as it did last year.  It's only 40 minutes from my house & nice jumbos.
884048,Freshtrax,2014-11-30 06:02:00,2215,I usually fished simcoe every weekend.    Now that I bought a house in kitchener I plan on focusing my ice fishing  efforts to 2-3 trips this winter.   We're going to make weekends out of them and find some new places to explore.    I really would like to ice a spake.
882971,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-25 15:59:00,956,"Last few years I have focused on Cooks Bay catching one dink perch after another.  No more and I'm heading up to Quinte to catch some walleye.  Purchasing a flasher very soon so hopefully that will give me an advantage.  A $600 one should help, but if you guys got any suggestions let me know.   Where else is everyone going?"
882975,BillM,2014-11-25 16:06:00,17367,Magical places for giant greasers
882977,Old Man,2014-11-25 16:19:00,822,About 500 yards in front of my house
882978,AKRISONER,2014-11-25 16:20:00,5558,"Magical places for giant greasers  scanning charts, reading deeply into your reports...hoping for ice to allow me to find your holes  To be honest though the majority of my time will be spent in a spot right in front of my cottage in Pointe au Baril. my goal is to catch a 10lb+ pike through the ice this year."
882982,mike rousseau,2014-11-25 16:28:00,4661,"Anywhere my son can get bites... He likes playing on ""the blue fort""  I don't have the same drive on hard water that I do on soft water... Its my relax with family time...  We target numbers of perch and sunfish now..."
882991,Joeytier,2014-11-25 16:59:00,3990,"Definitely a few ZEC trips, and a couple backlakes close to my house that I know hold giant pike"

883008,Acountdeleted,2014-11-25 18:06:00,2562,A few spots I'm curious about North of the Muskokas. I've always wanted to ice fish Quinte but it just seems too big without a sled.  I have a few lakes I got skunked on last year that I'm determined to figure out.  Anywhere where they Lake Trout are biting.
883021,Beans,2014-11-25 18:50:00,3339,Poor health has curtailed my ice fishing activities the past few years...My last trip was in my backyard the year they opened the Kawarthas for panfish and I came up empty...  I'm now with Lew...Bring on the Spring !!!
