883507,Kwikkfish,2014-11-27 05:44:00,3,"Hey Bondar, I purchased the XI 5 this spring, 24v 80lb 60 inches.  I previously owned a Terrova with same specs.  The Xi5 is definately quicker, quieter and has a tighter spot lock.  This is however compared to an older model Terrova.  Knowing Minn Kota they have addressed any issues.  Had 1 hickup with motor and customer service was awesome!"
883588,aplumma,2014-11-27 19:35:00,6896,I am waiting for the download so it will talk to the hds5 Gen2 unit before getting one. All of my research has come back as it being a little quieter and the anchor feature as being tighter than the minn kota. The minn kota has a better display on the hand fob as to what the motor is doing though.    Art
