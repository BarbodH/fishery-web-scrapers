883990,misfish,2014-11-29 19:01:00,29133,P A has them. Usually around 20-25 bux.  You have a PM.
883992,kickingfrog,2014-11-29 19:12:00,8333,Thanks Brian. The one for the security system is dead and for now I've put one from the finder in the panel.  At least the beeping has stopped.
883993,Terry,2014-11-29 19:15:00,14456,if you can't get a free one these guys will have them cheap

884009,Raf,2014-11-29 21:58:00,3495,don't know your location but those electronics places on matheson near dixie/401 have them for cheap.  i think i paid $12-15

Regardless of battery type. the more expensive one will be better.    With the SLA's you're looking for, all you need to do is look at those crappy rechargeable no-name spotlights and portable car boosters from from garbage stores like princess auto, xscargo, harbor freight, etc..  Most don't last 1/2 year before the battery is shot and the light/booster is garbage.  When they are working, performance sub par because the battery's capacity and ampacity are so low.   The specs on the labels that you went by in choosing the device are made up like they are for all knock off products.   7000000 candlepower flashlights for $25 that run off a 6v SLA and 55w 6v H3 bulb.  yeah, sure"

Sometimes companies are will to give a little extra if you are ready to walk away.  The only way to get a decent price from Rogers or Bell is to threaten to cancel your service.  I have had up to four free cable boxes from Rogers because was ready to switch to Bell if they didn't do something for me.  I haven't tried to get a free battery from ADP yet; but I seem to recall someone posting that they did get a free battery replacement when they said they would cancel the service otherwise."
