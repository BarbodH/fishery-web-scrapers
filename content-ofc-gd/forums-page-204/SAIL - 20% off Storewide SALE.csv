883059,Fisherman,2014-11-25 21:44:00,7201,"Sail has the worst web page ever really Mickey Mouse very little product info Have to agree, it's horrible."
883120,Burtess,2014-11-25 23:51:00,901,Nothing worse than the BassPro website...... at least the stuff on the Sail website is in CAD!!  Burt
883324,mattybculp,2014-11-26 17:07:00,388,"I have to agree, although I love the store, there website is pathetic. ( at least time I was on there). Say what you will about bps website, but I think they got it figured out. They may not convert into Canadian dollars, but at least I can find what I'm looking for."
883359,wkrp,2014-11-26 18:48:00,656,I aggree about their website but bass pro and cabellas prices are still higher than prices at sail with the 20% off
883388,Canuck2fan,2014-11-26 22:34:00,1444,"Umm every been to LeBaron's website LOL. There is a reason they are so much cheaper on tons of the stuff I buy and I think it is because they haven't paid a web designer in about 15 years. If you want to cut and paste you might just be able to cobble together an order to give them your money, but they DO NOT make it easy LOL."
