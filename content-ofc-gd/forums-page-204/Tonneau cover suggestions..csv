883846,sofabed,2014-11-29 00:09:00,119,I have had the Trifecta tri fold on my truck for 6 years. No issues and easy to stow or fold up if you need to.

883947,ch312,2014-11-29 15:40:00,1590,No tonneau cover is going to stop a thief who knows you have valuables in the back. Even the heavy duty aluminum ones posted above are easily pried up with a crow bar to gain access to the box.   I just received one yesterday as an early Christmas present. It's a Freedom by Extang (cheaper than their Trifecta) and appears to be very well built and is super easy to use. Time will tell if it's any good or not.  I've already rigged up a switched light from stuff laying around the house and intend on mounting it to the rear left corner of the box and getting it's power source from the 7 pin trailer 12v constant supply. I had a cover on my Dakota and it drove me nuts not being able to see under the cover.    As for the cover freezing to the tailgate. Apply a thin layer of vaseline to the tonneau's weather seal and the tailgate.

Any suggestions for styles, brands? Anyone have any experience with the tri-fold? Don't want to go over $1000 if possible."

883732,Fishwilly,2014-11-28 12:41:00,206,I've had this model on my last two F150's and tough as nails. You have to make sure to keep it super clean of snow and ice in winter otherwise it doesn't want to fold too well.  https://www.partsengine.ca/p-1643-bak-industries-bakflip-g2-tonneau-cover.aspx

883738,Tom McCutcheon,2014-11-28 13:05:00,627,"I am using the same as Fishwilly and have no complaints. As he states, you must brush the snow off it prior to opening. Because the tailgate on my truck locks, it is also pretty secure when closed. The tailgate needs to open before the cover can be moved. Just under $1000. taxes included"

I just ordered another one for my new Laramie Diesel yesterday  . They roll up in any weather, simple one person operation, support snow loads without collapsing and are totally out of the way when rolled up.  I have had zero issues with durability, tears etc.   If you want to take it right off, it's one bolt and gone in no time.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Fy-LfFERqow"

883765,Old Man,2014-11-28 15:06:00,822,I've had a Lund soft trifold on my 05 Silverado for 9 years. No problems and still looks and works great.
883776,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-28 16:19:00,10439,The Diamond Back aluminium covers are near bullet proof and easy to install and remove if you need to carry something large. They are also strong enough to carry a 4 wheeler on top so you can still carry the rest of your ice fishing gear under the cover. They are over your budget though.  http://www.diamondbackcovers.com/lt/  They come in bright and black bedliner covered options.    ATV carrier add on.  http://www.diamondbackcovers.com/atv-carrier/

I totaly assumed i had a 2-3 max on it being it cost only $300 or so but its honestly as good as the day I bought it, And like some others have said its easy on and off when I need to remove it. out of 4 stars I'd rate it a 5, the extra star being for unexpectedly better then expected lol..."
883831,irishfield,2014-11-28 22:55:00,26272,"My soft cover trifold went 8 years on my '03 before I traded it in and the only wear on it was the cover had shrunk ever so slightly it was starting to pull off the back corner by 1/4"". Probably still on there, with who ever owns it now.  So I bought the identical Extang soft tri-fold for my '11 F150. No leaks... etc.  One thought for you though... if you plan to haul stuff that needs the cover completely removed, be aware that most of the folding covers once taken off are then longer than the box on most of todays ""short"" box trucks and you won't be able to close your tailgate with the folded cover removed but sideways in the box."
883843,porkpie,2014-11-28 23:44:00,2521,"Perhaps mine is the trifecta.  I can't remember the name, it's a soft skin, not aluminum.  Whatever you call it, excellent product!"
