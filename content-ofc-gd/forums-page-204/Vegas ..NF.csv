881207,2 tone z71,2014-11-17 02:34:00,1311,Looking to go to Vegas ..I'm sure a few of you have been ..looking for suggestions ..to dos ..not to dos ..hotel suggestions ..thanks fellas
881222,Big Cliff,2014-11-17 11:42:00,6899,"Suggestion: Book it through one of the package deals since this is your first trip there, that way if you do have any issues you have someone to sort it out for you.  Get downtown to Fremont Street if you can at night, the light show is pretty nice to see.  Rent a car and go for a drive out of town, Area 51, Hoover Dam, The Grand Canyon, there is so much to see, any time we go there we always make a point of spending a day driving out to some of these places, there are plenty of things to see in the desert as well.  We enjoy getting all the free coupon books too and lay them out so we start at our hotel and walk the strip. You can make a whole day out of it and enjoy all kinds of free stuff, shrimp cocktails, free spins on slot machines, all sorts of food.............  Do not get sucked into any of these ""FREE gifts just for attending a short presentation"" deals. They are high pressure time share types of deals and will tie you up for hours. Total waste of time!  If you are going to do any gambeling just remember any jackpots over $1200.00 they will automatically hold back about 30% of it for taxes, you can recover it once you get back to Canada but it is a big hassle. If you are going to play slots, play machines that have smaller payouts, they pay more often anyway.  Lastly, set yourself a daily budget and stick to it, I have seen plenty of people loose whatever they came with and then a lot more than they can afford trying to get back to even. Those casinos didn't get to be that big and fancy by paying out money! Have Fun!"

881268,2 tone z71,2014-11-17 18:59:00,1311,Thanks Cliff  the ole lady and I will be going in the next few months ..appreciate all the info ..the dam..and canyon are deff on my list ..she wants to see the strip and shows and nightlife etc ..I'm not Hugh on gambling I'd rather buy tackle lol..thanks again
881283,Garnet,2014-11-17 20:00:00,2056,I would stay in old vegas and take the green rocket to the strip.
881288,FrankTheRabbit,2014-11-17 20:12:00,479,"Cirque de Soleil shows are always a huge draw. The food down there has always been good that can fit into any sort of budget. I've also been fairly lucky with the customer service at the those restaurants as well.  Long story short: Group of 6 guys, sat down the restaurant at 7:30pm, was busy, and I had a flight to catch at 11:00pm. Everyone ordered drinks, an app, and a main course. A few of us split a 72oz rib steak. Anyhow, order was made at 7:45pm and we requested if the food could come out a little quicker, since I had that flight to catch. No word of a lie, all of our food came to our table in 10-15 minutes! The steak was also pre-cut to fork sized bites. All you had to do, was stab and stuff in your mouth. lol This was in one of the restos at the Monte Carlo.  I've also heard in some hotels, you could get a room upgrade if you put some 20s in a white envelope. But that would depend on availability and depends who you get at the check-in desk.  Always had a fun time there and always left wishing a few more extra days.  I think it's one of the very few places where you can blow off $1mil in one dayâ€¦I think the Wynn hotel even has a Ferrari dealership within it. lol  They have gun ranges, exotic sports car rentals, rent track time in a Nascar, dune buggies (so fun!), helicopter rides, and various ""bunny"" ranches. Pool/drink/music parties non-stop, nuts.  Anyhow, I'm sure whatever you decide, it will be a very fun time."
881312,jbailey,2014-11-17 22:01:00,866,"A few friends of mine were upgraded when they put a little extra in the envelope. I would stay somewhere on the new strip, there are some good package deals if you look around. Bellagio is really nice, as well as the Venetian. I have stayed at Treasure Island but that was a little dated. The other end of the strip has MGM Grand which is really nice. The gun ranges are pretty cool."
881322,mukluk,2014-11-17 22:31:00,196,Only been to Vegas once; but had a great time.  Plenty to see and do without gambling if you wish.  Just one word of caution. Watch your wallet.  I caught a pick-pocket just as he was trying to unload my wallet from my rear pocket down on Freemont St.   Overall we had a great time and will definately  return again to Vegas.
881334,Canuck2fan,2014-11-17 23:29:00,1444,"Check out if the Harrah properties still offer the NO service charge added rates. Some hotels have a nifty little money grab where they tack on about 10.00 bucks after the package price per day, which you only find out when you go to check in. Harrah properties didn't in 2010.  They also had a great food offer when I was there, 29.99 for a 24 hr buffet pass, good at any of their properties. Basically your food for the whole day was only 29.99, plus the tips you left. With all the hotels in the group that had buffets you just had to pick your one for breakfast, lunch and dinner within the 24hrs the pass lasted.  To maximize your trip, find a deal with a direct flight, that lands there at 7am or so, and that your return flight doesn't leave until 10PM Vegas time. You basically get 4 days but only need a hotel for 3 nights save about 20% that way. It is VEGAS you won't sleep anyway LOL. To save the most though fly from Buffalo or Detroit.  Pick up your rental by 8am local time and you will have time to go World Famous Silver and Gold, (Pawn Stars). The Gun shop, Ricks Restoration, then park at your hotel and walk around to see some of the other attractions at the major casinos for free, until check in time. The sharks at Mandalay Bay, the lions at MGM. We actually drove out to the California border, and into Baker, just to get pics for one of the gals with us who collects pictures of her standing beside state and provincial signs. In 4 days we went to Cali, Utah, Arizona so having unlimited miles and a rental that allows you to leave the state of Nevada is a must, if you are going to Hoover Dam (which is on the way to the Grand Canyon).  Also be sure if you have a car rental to take a trip off the strip to a local Walmart or Costco, as soon as you pick up your car, buy all the pop/mix, liquor and water you will need there. Buy the cheapest large container you can find... At the hotel fill the container with beverages and ice from the machine. Keep some cold all the time that way you are there. (it was 6.00 bucks for anything beverage from the mini fridge and 3.50 from the vending machines in our hotel. We saved about 25 bucks a day each that way. Bottled water or soda is EXPENSIVE at 3 to 4 bucks each everywhere else. On our car trips we just used a smaller cooler... Trust me after hiking in the desert for an hour you will be thirsty, killer thirsty if you are hung over LOL !!!  One thing you HAVE to do is go grab one of the  2.99 or 3.99 Steak and Egg specials between 2am and 6am... BEST FREE entertainment in town. We saw Elvis fighting with Captain Jack Sparrow and Marilyn Monroe (with a few miles on her mind you) breaking it up, and it was real no play acting LOL. This was at Bills beside the Flamingo, the food was better than OK, especially since we walked in with two water glasses filled to the top with Rye from our room each, no one batted an eye.  All the locals were hilarious. Bills unfortunately is closed but the Flamingo also had a restaurant offering the same type of deal as do others.  You can carry your own alcohol around basically everywhere, so don't pay Casino prices for it. (NO CASINO gives out free drinks anymore, to get a single drink comp, you basically have to have gambled and lost about 60 bucks U.S.) Rather than pay 7 bucks a shot for Canadian Whisky, we just brought our own everywhere LOL.  DO NOT go to see the Grand Canyon at the Reservation it is about 90 bucks a couple with all the fees to go down into the canyon on their bus. Which is a money grab, but the worst part is they keep you for about 4 hrs between waiting to get on a bus and seeing some crappy shows, on top of the 2 hr drive there if the Dam is packed (although you can by pass it on the new route). Find one of the free access points to the Canyon which are a little further to travel but still take less time than the dog and pony shows they put on. (while driving to the reservation if you choose to do it, watch out wild cows, they just wander across the road all the time)  So much to see and do depending on your interests. If you like to drive be sure and check out the Valley of Fire national park near Vegas. I found it more interesting than the Grand Canyon which is just a big friggin hole in the ground in my opinion LOL."
881361,Big Cliff,2014-11-18 00:46:00,6899,"Area 51 is open Cliff? Don't they still shoot on sight for trying to peak In:) It's a secret, I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you"
881367,ketchenany,2014-11-18 01:08:00,3229,Did you get a better crop of shrooms that me? lol.  never been to Vagas but my kids have and had a wonderful time.
881475,Carp,2014-11-18 20:06:00,1488,"I was there in July 2014. My youngest had a dance competition at Bally's. We stayed at the Paris next door. There's a hallway on ground floor between the two, so didn't have to venture outside in the heat much.  Metro pizza is on the street behind Bally's. It's in the Ellis Island Casino. Sunday and Thursdau night was 2 for 1 pizza. 2 large pizza's will cost you roughly $20, and it's good pizza. Fed 5 of us and we had left overs for the next day too.  Went to Walgreens or Walmart for snacks and drinks to keep in our room. Get away from the main strip and food prices come down dramatically. Bought bottles of wine at Walmart for $3/bottle and it was decent stuff. Same stores on the strip are much more $$$.  We had a couple of dinners on the strip as well, but with 5 to feed, the bill was stupidly expensive for what we ate.  Have a blast ! Cheers !!!"
881718,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 19:06:00,6899,"From the sound of it things are changing almost daily. We use to fly in on a charter (no, not a private charter LOL). Instead of waiting for the bus, we would just advise the tour operator we would arrange our own transportation.  Then we'd jump in a limo ((about $20.00) to our hotel (we liked to think we were big spenders LOL)  If we booked tickets to a show I would always go and see the matradee prior to the show and explain that I wanted to impress a lady, what would a front row booth cost me? Usually $20.00 would get you into the ""invited guest line and guarantee a front row booth"". (It usually ended up impressing the lady and was well worth the extra $20.00  ) Ok so truth be told, it impressed her so much she married me and has stuck around for 30+ years!  Ok, OK, so it was a couple of $20.00s in the end but when you are in love........."
881765,Mister G,2014-11-19 22:43:00,1429,"I know many here only trying to help but most is dated to say the least.  We go at least once a year if not twice.......been there about 14-15 times.  Not sure what your budget is but almost every hotel on the strip plus many in downtown now charge you resort fees up to $25 plus taxes on top of the already agreed price you have with your initial reservation.  DON'T......I repeat DON'T make any reservations with any third parties like Expedia or Travilocity because you cannot cancel and rebook at a cheaper price like you can when you make a res with the hotel direct.  It is MUCH better to use a taxi to most hotels then a shuttle if there are 2 or more of you.  I personally think all the Circus act in Vegas are BORING....you seen one you seen them all. But so many other shows to see depending on what you like.  If you stay at the high end hotels you will be paying high end for everything including almost all restaurants.  We really like MGM Grand but the prices of the food in there restaurants is way out of our league lately.  I would recommend Harrah's for the first time as it VERY reasonable and right at mid strip........hotels like MGM and Ceasars are HUGE HUGE HUGE and take up to 45 minutes to walk to the strip from your room.  We love Vegas and love to talk about it so don't hesitate to PM or use this means to contact us as we have MANY other tips to pass on............like who has the best pools, restaurants, cheap food, how to get free drinks at the bar and what shows to see and not see. Not to mention some of the best forum sites to ask many questions......just like this on.  BTW you will go back and you don't have to gamble a dime to enjoy yourself."
881789,Big Cliff,2014-11-19 23:51:00,6899,Now this is someone I would talk to!!!!!
882124,lookinforwalleye,2014-11-21 13:57:00,4399,last time I was in Vegas Michael Corleone was still running things and they were still burying people in the desert!!!  I would love to go back one day I would imagine it has changed a bit!!!
882173,Mister G,2014-11-21 16:55:00,1429,"This is one of the best places to get show tickets......again only book rooms through the hotel direct but everything else they offer is on the UP and UP. Never had a problem using the Best of Vegas and sometimes half the price then buying direct with the hotel for show tickets. Again, I advise steering clear of the Circus acts but then again you might enjoy ONE......click on see all shows and then you can even categorize them, like only comedy's or only adult shows.  http://www.bestofvegas.com/?&utm_campaign=Logo-Top&j=1009088&[emailÂ protected]&l=6980_HTML&u=35241243&mid=1057435&jb=0&utm_source=Email&utm_medium=November-20-2014-BOV-Newsletter-Resend"
882398,wjw,2014-11-22 17:17:00,35,"We stay at the Flamingo on the strip.  It is a little older but the rooms are clean and priced reasonably. I like the location as you are pretty much in the center of activity and when you step out the casino you are on the strip. Other hotels such as Caesar's are designed to discourage you from leaving. It probably takes you 10 minutes from the time you leave Caesar's until you hit the strip sidewalks. This is despite the fact that they are located directly across from the Flamingo.  We always rent a car at the airport and the location of the Flamingo's parking garage allows you to avoid the strip traffic and access the less traveled backroads.  It really is a time saver.  Even if you are staying elsewhere, try the Flamingo's breakfast buffet. It is outstanding.  My wife and I are not big gamblers but really enjoy Vegas. We usually end up taking a side trip somewhere. It's not uncommon for us to spend two days in Vegas, take a side trip for a couple of days, then return for several more before departing.  You can be at the beach in California in 5 hours or Bryce Canyon in Utah in 3.5 hours.  If you have never seen Bryce it is spectacular."
882579,pike slayer,2014-11-23 16:07:00,1177,I got married in vegas almost 2 years ago. We stayed at the mirage. it was very nice no complaints but there are cheaper places. I highly recommend staying somewhere on the strip and buying a $7 a day bus pass that you can ride as much as you like for that day. I stayed there for a week and a week was definitely not long enough. You can take a week just walking around checking out the different hotels on the strip. Depending on what type of person you are i would not rent a car. For one i'd be to hammered haha and second theres so much to see good luck keeping your eyes on the road. There are packages for seeing the grand canyon and the hoover dam. I would not buy tickets for shows or anything online. There are discount ticket booths all over the strip with tickets that are much cheaper. Bring yourself some real good shoes you are going to do a ton of walking! If you need to know any other details feel free to PM me.
882906,2 tone z71,2014-11-25 04:12:00,1311,Amazing info fellas..can't say enough how much I appreciate all of it..looking forward to this
882923,Mister G,2014-11-25 12:38:00,1429,"One other tip........on your first trip there don't spend all that money to be in Vegas and then go elsewhere, like the Grand Canyon (over 8 hour drive) or even the Damn (45 minute drive) or Red Rock (45 minute drive).  And if like your adult beverages DO NOT rent a car....actually no need for one on the strip."
883206,pike slayer,2014-11-26 02:48:00,1177,"When i was there i took a small plane over the dam and the canyon it as around $100 a head. You could see boats in the canyon that looked like ants and couldn't really grasp the true size of it. I'd recommend spending the extra money and do the helicopter for $300 they land down in the canyon and they provide a lunch with champagne. you leave at around 9am and back by about 3pm and you still get all evening to enjoy your time without wasting 2 days driving around in the boonies. remember in vegas you can drink anywhere like on the street, in a cab, even in the mall. i felt like julian from trailer park boys carrying around a rum and coke when my wife shopped for clothes at the big fashion mall lol. The only place i found where i wasn't allowed to drink was in city hall getting my marriage license haha they told me i either had to toss my beer or go outside and finish it. One thing i noticed about vegas is everyone seemed to be having a good time. nobody was fighting everywhere i went it just seemed like a good atomsphere. And you dont have to gamble. i sat down at the slots to see if they would actually give me free drinks and they did. i got served 2 drinks while playing the penny slots and spend $4. Also you HAVE to go to BLT burger in the mirage. best burger you'll ever eat."

I had a colorado buffalo burger and it was one of the most incredible burgers I have ever had. Also, I noticed some of the casinos were a little more hesitant than others to give out the free drinks or take a long time to bring one back for you. I found if you give a relatively decent tip, they will come around more often, but make sure to ask for 2!"
