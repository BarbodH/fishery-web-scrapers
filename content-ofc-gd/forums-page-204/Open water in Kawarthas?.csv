883529,mike rousseau,2014-11-27 13:53:00,4661,Message me if you want... I'm on vacation sun-sat next week... I have obligations sun&mon but free the rest of the week
883539,Big Cliff,2014-11-27 14:44:00,6899,"Balsam lake (South Bay area) a thin skim of ice as far as the eye can see.  Sturgeon Lake (Goose Bay area) much the same, looks like there is some open water out about the middle, lots of birds out there, guls, ducks, geese."
883684,Fisherpete,2014-11-28 01:10:00,1814,You down for a muskie hunt Mike? Send me a PM and we can figure out the details! Would have to be on a weekend though.
883685,Weeds,2014-11-28 01:16:00,782,It's over dude. Time to let go. Hibernate and dream of early June.
883687,Fisherpete,2014-11-28 01:22:00,1814,It ain't over till the fat musky bites  Lol  Or something like that
883690,mike rousseau,2014-11-28 01:27:00,4661,Yeah  PM sent  Looks like we are starting a December musky hunt tradition...  I'll have open water for a while yet
883850,Rizzo,2014-11-29 00:27:00,4754,go get em boys! We went to Balsam last week and had to break a bit of ice at the launch...good times! Mitchell was totally frozen over so we were a bit nervous
882341,Fisherpete,2014-11-22 12:31:00,1814,"Anyone know if there is ice on Balsam, Pigeon or Sturgeon? Was thinking about heading out in the boat tomorrow if possible.  Cheers Pete"
882353,Jer,2014-11-22 14:17:00,1426,"Pigeon Lake (at least south of the causeway) is totally covered in ice, what I can see of Buckhorn from my house (Youngs Cove area) is totally covered in ice. Chemong is mostly open, but shorelines may be iced.  Access to any ramps may be trouble, there's a lot of snow on the ground up here..."
882354,Sinker,2014-11-22 14:31:00,8692,"Rice is pretty much froze over too. I wanted to duck hunt, but cant find an open launch. There is lots of open water, you just cant get a boat in. You could almost icefish muskies on scugog lol  S."
882362,esoxansteel,2014-11-22 14:43:00,1307,"A couple of issues ive seen is the snow plows have plowed, but have left a big lump of snow, right where the boat drops to the water. and there 2 to 2 1/2 feet high, so id bring a shovel to clear a path,"
882364,Fisherpete,2014-11-22 14:48:00,1814,LOL I actually was thinking about the ice fishing for muskies thing last night... Jig a pounder bulldawg with a 2x4 as the rod...
882370,lew,2014-11-22 14:56:00,12766,"Chemong is mostly open, but shorelines may be iced.    I was by Chemong yesterday Jer and it was pretty well skimmed all the way across north of the Causeway"
882372,Pigeontroller,2014-11-22 15:09:00,2793,Pigeon Lake has a causeway???
882407,captpierre,2014-11-22 17:37:00,2521,Pigeon Lake has a causeway???  Ya was wondering where you meant.  Gannon?  Omeeme?
882424,irishfield,2014-11-22 18:22:00,26272,I imagine Jer is referring to the bridge/causeway between Pigeon and Buckhorn Lakes
882439,JoshS,2014-11-22 19:01:00,729,"I was thinking about tomorrow too... Anyone know how balsam looks around rosedale?  We broke ice to get out of nogies last weekend... Has to be locked by now. Not sure how the launch in bobcaygeon is looking, but imagine there's ice on the west side too."
882444,Fisherpete,2014-11-22 20:38:00,1814,"I was thinking that same launch Josh, let me know if you hear anything!  Pete"
882449,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-22 20:52:00,956,Hopefully if you go out you have better luck then me this year on Buckhorn.  Out 7 times netted only 3 muskies.  Good luck
882451,Big Cliff,2014-11-22 20:58:00,6899,"Looking out my window over Sturgeon Lake (Goose Bay area) Looks like ice right across. Just checked with a friend on Balsom, South Bay is ice as far as he can see."
882477,Fisherpete,2014-11-22 22:53:00,1814,"Thanks Cliff. Not the answer I was hoping for, but saves me half a tank of gas tomorrow! Guess it's time to put the boat to bed for the winter..."
882485,Jer,2014-11-22 23:14:00,1426,"Sorry, I meant ""narrows""."
882587,JoshS,2014-11-23 16:46:00,729,Appreciate the info Cliff. I gotta go up next weekend to grab the boat... maybe get in another shot after this warm spell and rain. If not gonna pack the quinte gear and go for a drive sat morning.
882629,Sinker,2014-11-23 21:37:00,8692,Anyone know if theres a launch open at gannons narrows?
883360,BucktownAngler,2014-11-26 18:53:00,582,anyone know if otonabee in peterborough is ice free?
883370,lew,2014-11-26 19:41:00,12766,"anyone know if otonabee in peterborough is ice free?  I'd imagine it is Boss, there's lots of current flowing down there right now. Clear & Katchawanooka never did freeze last week and their the last 2 lakes draining into the river."
883378,Sinker,2014-11-26 20:52:00,8692,Id say everything is wide open again after the winds on monday.  S.
883415,Fisherpete,2014-11-26 23:33:00,1814,Cliff - any chance on getting another Balsam ice report from your bud on South Bay? Would appreciate it!  Thanks Pete
883506,JoshS,2014-11-27 05:41:00,729,"Couple cold nights with low winds coming up. If it is fishable now, might not be by sat . Really hope it is.. The weekend forecast is looking good as of now.  I'm driving through rosedale fri night regardless. If no one gets you an update Pete I'll check back here and let you know how it looks."
883508,Big Cliff,2014-11-27 05:47:00,6899,"Pete, I will give him a call in the morning for you. Sturgeon is pretty much open, there are some ice flows but mostly in protected areas. A thin skim of ice in sheltered bays this morning but that was it for new ice. -7 tonight so it might thicken a bit."
883513,Fisherpete,2014-11-27 11:18:00,1814,Awesome - thanks guys! Dying to get out somewhere... Anywhere lol
883528,mike rousseau,2014-11-27 13:51:00,4661,Time to travel Pete....  Zero ice here
