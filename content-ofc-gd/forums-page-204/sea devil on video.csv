The female black sea devil anglerfish was filmed 580 metres below the surface of the ocean on Nov. 17 using a remote-controlled robotic submarine by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California.  As of Monday morning, the video of a female black sea devil anglerfish has already been watched 1.4 million since it was posted on YouTube three days earlier.  Anglerfish are monstrous-looking deep-sea predators named and known for a worm-like appendage on their heads that emits light. The fish waves the lure around in order entice prey into their gaping mouths.  According to the research institute, anglerfish have only been captured on video a handful of times. To the researchers knowledge, this particular species was never filmed previously.  The beady-eyed, nine-centimetre-long fish, which swims with its toothy mouth open wide, is captured in such detail that you can see a broken tooth flapping as it swims and tiny dots on its skin that are used to sense the movements of its prey.  The researchers report they know it is a female because males are much smaller and dont have a lure, as their main focus is reproduction rather than hunting."

882852,Moosebunk,2014-11-25 00:28:00,3970,"Cool Rob.  I think because this fish was video'd recently, it may be one that was caught live and sent somewhere to be the first in captivity as well...?  Thought I read that somewhere not long ago...?"

882862,ketchenany,2014-11-25 00:53:00,3229,Discovery just reported that they have one in a very dark and cold aquarium but don't expect it to live long. It seems odd how big it looks but it's only 3-5 inches long!
882951,cram,2014-11-25 14:35:00,1733,Very cool.
882953,cram,2014-11-25 14:37:00,1733,Definitely not the prettiest of fishes!
