883166,Moosebunk,2014-11-26 01:33:00,3970,"Saw that.  There's hope then for a full year of ice fishing in 2015.  For the first times since about 10,000 - 12,000 years ago.  Hooray!!!"
883207,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-26 03:01:00,956,I know after my 10th trip out ice fishing I can't wait any longer until spring.  Driving in the winter for 3 or 4 hours each way can be draining.  Hopefully it doesn't last too long.
