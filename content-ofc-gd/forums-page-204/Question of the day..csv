882918,Roy,2014-11-25 11:49:00,13728,This is the Weather Network's question of the day. The correct answer is fairly obvious but I'm wondering as to Google's motives.  Google plans to put an end to overfishing by doing THIS.

882920,outllaw,2014-11-25 12:13:00,1232,feel good plans rarely work. who polocies the plan?. plus the thousands of poor fishermen that use the sea as a food source. who will police the corporations offshore that import the oceans rape?
882925,G.mech,2014-11-25 12:45:00,830,"Just to put this into context, the plan is to track the positions of known commercial pirate fishing vessels on the internet using their AIS transponders so authorities can keep an eye on them.  There are 300 vessels on the 'blacklist' worldwide.  Not saying it makes sense but that is what they are talking about.  I guess we can put away our tinfoil hats, at least for now....."

883003,outllaw,2014-11-25 17:40:00,1232,funny the ont mnr had that plan of putting gps pucks on l.erie commercial tugs. every tug has a licence and zone for netting. as of now its not implemented... as for hi-seas pirates netting the country of orgin will never implement a usa law on the hi-seas.
