I live close to Bronte Park and was wondering if there any decent fishing this time of the year within the park.  Trying to avoid the FREE Parks due to there being more people fishing.  I have always considered going to Grand river but being far from where I live, would it be worth going at this time of the year, specifically by the Caledonia dam."

883011,davew3,2014-11-25 18:13:00,430,Bronte Creek valley is mostly clay.  Where the river bends the land is made up of material washed down the creek.  The water carves out holes in both the clay and soft material.   One step you can be in one foot of water.  The next 6 ft.   Also watch out for undercut banks that could collapse.  I have walked the creek from Kilbride to the lake (where legal) and it changes all the time.  Regards.
