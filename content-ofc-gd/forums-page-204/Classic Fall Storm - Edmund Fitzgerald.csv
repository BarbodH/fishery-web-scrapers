882726,4x4bassin,2014-11-24 14:42:00,1025,Wouldn't want to be on on the great lakes this morning .
882727,Locnar,2014-11-24 14:43:00,645,On Monday when we had 80-90km/hr wind gusts... I could see the waves affecting the horizon on Lake Ontario. I couldn't imagine how big those rollers woulda been
882734,Headhunter,2014-11-24 16:00:00,5703,Walleye chop! HH
882739,AKRISONER,2014-11-24 16:29:00,5558,"Walleye chop! HH  Dedication at its finest ahahha  Ive been in the rinker with my pops on GB in 10 footers. It wasnt too bad, but not fun by any means...the scariest part was turning around to head back in.  We put waves over the front of a 28 foot boat, it was pretty neat to watch.  16 is just ridiculous, and on erie would be entirely unorganized and terrifying."

882789,outllaw,2014-11-24 19:34:00,1232,the gales of November. I was on the lake that day. never ever will I question mother nature. 1 guy died that day near us. its no fun when your in the water praying..believe me.
882798,crappieperchhunter,2014-11-24 20:50:00,2582,its no fun when your in the water praying..believe me. Have been on the water twice when I wasn't sure if I was going to get back to shore. You are absolutely correct...it is zero fun.
882812,AKRISONER,2014-11-24 21:46:00,5558,"my uncle was a SARTECH for 20 years, when people get into trouble it was his job to get you back out of it.  hes got some good stories of hanging out of choppers and getting slammed into the sides of boats as they sat in 30ft rollers north of the queen charlottes."
