I take this time to do a cleanout of stuff I don't need, and try to give back to those that need it most. I have a few fishing related items that I could part with, that I'm sure someone would really appreciate (older rods/reels and the like). The only issue, I have no clue where to bring them or where they'll do the most good. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!"

Its held in honor of my good friend that passed, he was a drug and alcohol worker  last year was awesome! all prizes for the derby went to youth! the winner of the derby was 13, she went home with $1300, first fish, biggest fish, and second as well, also a youth angler award.  if you dont find a place for it, send it to me and ill make sure it lands in the hands of a youth angler:)"

I'm in Toronto though, so not sure how I'd get it to you. If anyone has any ideas, I'd be happy to send it to anywhere it would do good."
883496,manitoubass2,2014-11-27 04:09:00,11391,if your game I can pay shipping.

Works for me (purpose achieved even if the time frame is a bit longer). I have a few rod tubes lying around. I'll send you a PM and we'll figure it out. Glad it will go to someone who will enjoy it, and help those less fortunate."

883638,John Bacon,2014-11-27 23:13:00,3277,TUFA (Toronto Urban Fishing Association?) was looking for fishing equipment for their fishing days.  I can put you touch with them if you want to go that route.
883667,manitoubass2,2014-11-28 00:06:00,11391, plus if you can donate locally I think that a good call too!
883699,mattaw,2014-11-28 02:23:00,162,"no issue big cliff, we wanna get families and kids fishing everywhere!  plus if you can donate locally I think that a good call too!  I'm going to send it up to manitoubass2 if the shipping isn't too crazy (where cost outweighs the result), if I can't, I'll look into those other great ideas! Thanks guys"
883737,Big Cliff,2014-11-28 13:03:00,6899,"If there was enough stuff available from the GTA to make it worth while and it could be aranged so I could get it all as a planed route, I would consider donating a day of my time + fuel to round it all up and deliver it to a local UPS Store for shipping."
