883822,Terry,2014-11-28 22:29:00,14456,I thought the mark 4 was gray scale I must be thinking of a different one
883824,davey buoy,2014-11-28 22:31:00,5505,"I thought the mark 4 was gray scale I must be thinking of a different one Definitely not color Terry,my mistake I think ,looked at it on the bench ,had a color front on it I'm now thinking.Too bad,was ready to jump on it for the price if any good."
883825,misfish,2014-11-28 22:38:00,29133,This one Dave  
883826,davey buoy,2014-11-28 22:39:00,5505,"This one Dave   Think so,looks awful close to it with same color front."
883827,misfish,2014-11-28 22:42:00,29133,That one is 300 and change at radio world.
883828,Terry,2014-11-28 22:44:00,14456,thats the elite 4 isn't it
883829,davey buoy,2014-11-28 22:46:00,5505,"That one is 300 and change at radio world. Not color,that was what I took for granted,can get it for almost half that Brian.Already have a gray scale humming bird in the 3-$400 price range.Deciding if the built in GPS and North America chip would still be worth it?"
883972,misfish,2014-11-29 17:21:00,29133,"Must be this one I was looking at today Dave. I played around with it. Not a bad unit,but that was not out on the water.LOL  "
883974,davey buoy,2014-11-29 17:23:00,5505,"Must be this one I was looking at today Dave. I played around with it. Not a bad unit,but that was not out on the water.LOL   That's it,just under a $100,today,usually goes $3-$400 or so I believe ?"
883975,misfish,2014-11-29 17:25:00,29133,"LOL Tag says,$279.99"
883977,davey buoy,2014-11-29 17:28:00,5505,"LOL Tag says,$279.99 Not there Brian lol.Probably a reduced price as well?"
883978,misfish,2014-11-29 17:30:00,29133,Ok WHERE ? I might want a back up. LOL
883979,porkpie,2014-11-29 17:31:00,2521,"Colour is really really nice to have, but for under $100?  How bad could it be?"
883983,misfish,2014-11-29 17:40:00,29133,"Colour is really really nice to have, but for under $100? How bad could it be?  Yes colour .  Im not sure how the flasher will work with out it? Fish moves in it,s red, and when it,s right on the bait,it goes green. Or is that green first then red ? I havent used mine in a month.LOL  Bring on the ice."
883987,davey buoy,2014-11-29 18:29:00,5505,"Ok WHERE ? I might want a back up. LOL PM sent lol.You were only the second one,surprisingly lol."
884065,Raf,2014-11-30 13:51:00,3495,"i still use a monochrome on the front of my boat and on the ice.  i have no issue with it, tells you the depth, you can see your lure and the lakers chasing it on the screen.  i say go for it.  colour is a nice-to-have but a bit overstated IMO."
884075,Sinker,2014-11-30 15:17:00,8692,"I have colour, and monochrome, they both work just as well. I actually prefer the monochrome because the battery will last for days.  As long as you can mark bottom, fish, and your jig, your doing the same thing any other high end expensive unit is. You don't need anything fancy IMO.  S."
