I have to say, I think that was a wonderful thing for us, Canada to do!  My only question is: How the heck did we end up with a SURPLUS of $22,000,000.00 in Arctic survival gear in the first place?  I might be wrong but doesnâ€™t  surplus mean unnecessary? "
883628,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-27 23:00:00,10439,Cliff in government terms surplus means end of life or gear/products/assets that have been replaced by current/new items.  For instance when we replace computer equipment here @ the college it goes to the GNWTs surplus warehouse where it is either used in another department or donated to those in need. If the equipment is not usable it is sent to be recycled. In the past equipment has been donated to schools in Mexico so the under privileged children can use it for learning purposes.  In the case of this arctic gear it may have been replaced by newer gear and thus has become obsolete. Rather than throw it out it has been donated.  The first Monday of every month here in Yellowknife there is a sale open to the public of surplus goods that have not been donated or recycled. Everything from chairs and desks to printers and computers is available depending on current stock.
883632,Big Cliff,2014-11-27 23:06:00,6899,Thanks! I guess it is good that someone gets to use it rather than have to pay someone to dispose of it. Too bad some of it couldn't be used to help people right here in Canada too.
