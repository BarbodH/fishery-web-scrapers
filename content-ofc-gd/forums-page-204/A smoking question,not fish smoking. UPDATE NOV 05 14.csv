879721,misfish,2014-11-06 17:05:00,29133,"Stay away from the cheap crap. It,s disgusting. Stick with a premium .  I use Liquid EJUICE. Cowboy tabacco.  My fav flavored one is Pandora,s Box. Custard/caramel. And leaves a nice sent..  We have 4 vape stores here. 2 or good,the other are brutal."
879724,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-06 18:05:00,8243,"I never heard about Vapping until I read it here. We just yesterday were talking and I said to the guys, all retired, there's so much we don't learn about anymore because of being out of the loop, kids all grown up, grand kids all bus, And technically with whatever work you did and socially as the age range t work was from teen summer student  to folks in their 60's. I'm not hip anymore, 5 years ago I knew who Deadmouse was at 55 years old, now I don't know 1 artist in the running for a music video award, I'm so uncool again.  Until I saw the pic above have never even seen one, nothing like I thought, it's huge. I thought it would look like a tipped cigarillo or something. It looks like a breathalyser. I wouldn't use that in public, if I saw that used I would think it's a remote car starter for someone that has to blow for blood alcohol to unlock an auto's ignition.  Question, if someone hasn't had a cigarette for 6 months but still ""vapes"" have they quit smoking?  Keep up the good work Brian B and all those trying hard.  Someone asked me how the quitting is going and it's going not too bad. I said once you have smoked you never quit, you just don't smoke."
879725,Terry,2014-11-06 18:11:00,14456,"well if you still vaping nicotine , then you are still hooked on that drug and only total stopping makes you a non smoker....imho"

TAR being the big one. Ansd your also not drawing in hot smoke which I was told by my doc, is one of the worse thing about smokes.  Everyone I have asked whats in it, say the same thing.  e-liquids contain Propylene glycol USP (PG), Vegetable Glycerin USP (VG) , Nicotine (pharmaceutical grade),and concentrated food flavorings which are FDA approved for food applications."

For those that quit cold turkey,I hand my hat off to you. The bonus of this whole quiting this as of right now,I have saved a good chunk of change by not spending 10 bux a day. I spend 20 bux for my vape juice for the week, Maybe a few days more. What I do save now, goes into gas for the new truck and a few hunting and fishing treats for met I,m ok with that.  I have been down roads that the Avenger would,nt of, so It,s nice to go down those bumpy side trails/hills,with no worries. Happy happy happy.

I came so close to grabbing a pack of smokes a few times,but remembered my promise. Last night was the same crap. My promise is my promise. The lord knows I,m trying my best.   I needed to really think about this. In my mind,it was like ,why did I quit smoking if Im still hauling on the Ecig?  This morning I left the juice sticks on the counter and left without them. I have found that my morning draw has gone.  I was fishing a stretch today and I was like 50 yards down wind from the nearest angler. Can you believe I could smell that cig he was smoking.  (Ok, non smokers could to) it was amazing,cause as one that smoked,never thought of that. It didnt make me want one,but it made me think as to WOW.  Later on a friend stopped by to chat and he was smoking away. Oh this is where the smell and the sight of the cig was a test.  I would never, ever, tell someone that they need to put it out. I hate those REBORN DIPS.  We talked for over an hour about fishing and hunting, drinking coffee and he was drawing on his cigs. I found after about the first 15 minutes,it didnt bother me, didnt even notice really. Well i did ,when his cig was close to my hard top.

But Im working on it. that,s all that matters.  That,s how it,s going for me.  I only posted, for those that are wanting to quit and my findings.  Happy fishing Well done Brian, it is time for me to try again years of inhaling is taking it`s toll...the cough the wheezing spitting up crap every morning. Takes me a good hour or two to start breathing somewhat normally in the morning figure I have to do it now while I still have some lung capacity left!! The final push for me to try again was a co-worker that was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and watching what he is going through. Got the Champix start date is December 1st and the target quit date is December 8th... I tried Champix before and it worked great I was off cigs for almost 2 years but a piling on of personal crap I was dealing with at the time led to a relapse...no excuses this time!!!"
883564,Rod Caster,2014-11-27 16:15:00,5784,"With the e-cig I 'smoke' a lot less, so I don't worry too much about battery life. When I get strong cravings, like with beer, I'll use it a lot, but most of the day I just take a few hits here and there; I still can't get used to using it in public or while working.  Still smoke a few cigs a day, usually if a buddy comes over or if I'm working on a site , but overall it's a huge improvement for me"
875208,John,2014-10-03 13:27:00,2956,"I can't agree with the underline comment. Great it worked for you but others have quit in different ways. I believe quiting mostly depends on motivation. If you want to quit bad enough you will. If not fully commited you will likely fail. What motivates one person may not motivate another. I've seen some quit over price, health issues/concerns, tired of inconvienience ect. or in my case not being able to sleep for more than a couple of hours before waking up for a smoke. I was a 4 pack a day plus smoker. Cold turkey worked for me but do what ever works for you. It's been 32 years since I quit. Congratulation Brian on your start of the process. Isn't that kinda what I said..?"
875210,John,2014-10-03 13:35:00,2956,"Nobody knows the health effects of the e-cigarettes.   The UN health agency just put out a worldwide recommendation today urging governments to regulate their use until health studies are done.    Although it might seem a bit of an overreaction, I think it's a serious enough issue that it needs to be done.   However, If it were me and I was having difficulty quitting smoking, I'd try it.   It's not likely to be worse for your health than cigarettes, and the worst case is, you'll probably save money and stop smelling like smoke.  The biggest issue is the children.   E-cigs are getting very popular with teenagers.   Nicotine is highly addictive.   Even if there are no health consequences, which I doubt, I wouldn't want my children addicted to anything.  I can also guarantee the next thing will be THC + nicotine liquids for e-cigs (if they don't already exist).   That will be a nightmare.  I find it somewhat humorous there are all these people are up in arms about GMO food, but e-cigs have far more potential to be dangerous. This is already happening and becoming a problem!"

Now they usually are smoking with their parents and I know of one family where 3 generations sit around and puff away. A family that smokes together stays together I guess. Maybe Grandma gets the good stuff.  10 days to go, can't wait to start. Going out to the rez tomorrow and buy the nastiest cigarettes I can find there."

That's a huge step, now you know you won't go crazy if you don't have your vape around. Next step is to gradually leave it out of your plans until you just don't bother with it at all! The improtant thing is to keep your eye on the goal - being totally smoke and vape free - and whatever road you take to get there is the right one for you. Everyone has an opinion because of what method was successful for them, but everyone is different and at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter what method you use, as long as the result is being smoke and nicotine free and a longer and healthier life.

I would slip to give myself a reason to start smoking again. Previously I would slip and say to myself That's it, I smoked, I failed, hand me a cigarette. I'm going into it this time saying you will slip, it's not the end of the world, don't waste 3 weeks of pain, you aren't a loser, you are human. Have that smoke and forget it.

879477,Rod Caster,2014-11-04 23:44:00,5784,"Good job Brian. You are doing well and I've been following your thread  I just bought a vapor cigarette today. PIcked up a throat cold and have been thinking about quitting again, so figured why not, it's time to try. So far, I dont' mind it, but I think I'll be embarassed to use it in public; it's bigger than I thought it would be. How do you like that? Do you find it's weird pulling it out in front of people?? I chose the strong tobacco flavor but will try other flavors later.  It cost a bit more than a carton of smokes, so if I don't smoke for 1.5 weeks and just use the vapor cig, then I really didn't lose anything. I'm at the 18mg nicotine to start, I'm not a super heavy smoker, but I like strong smokes."

For some of us (me included) it actually really  makes it difficult to breath, and the smell alone even at 50 yards away is a bit offensive.  Working in Toronto you can imagine how bad it sucks having to walk through a cloud of choking smoke at every single building's entrance way, the smoke literally chokes me to a point that I have to hold my breath just to walk inside.  Im all for people's rights and stuff, but i hear the same story a lot, once people quit they realize just how gross it is. Im glad to hear you are on your way to a healthier wealthier life."
879672,Freshtrax,2014-11-06 03:19:00,2215,  I've been vaping for a while now.  I used it as a tool to quit for 4 months. Regressed back to real smokes but back on the vape again....i started with the evod but found I was always scrambling to charge batteries.  This thing lasts for days and I can even charge my phone with it.   Way to go Brian.  Pic makes it look bigger than it is.  It's about  6 inches tall.
879675,Dutch,2014-11-06 03:43:00,831,Good going sounds like you are on track to quit.  If your friend respected you and was aware you are trying to quit he wouldnt light up in front of you. It isnt about you asking him not to light up it is about him respecting your decision to quit.

I can go to work and leave my sticks at home and not smoke all day. When I get home,I will smoke but not crazy. I can smoke a pack in two days,BUT,when Im fishing,a half a pack is not a problem in 6hrs . This is where the e cig would be very helpful IMO for me.  If the mrs,s stays on this e cig,I will try and go cold turkey,as there is no smell and that may help with the trigger system in my body. She has commented that she does feel better and not so heavy in the chest. A lot less coughing in the mornings.  J  Let me know how that mist thing goes. And good luck to you.

869632,dhickey,2014-08-27 01:50:00,1038,I started using e cigs or vaping as some like to call it  about  2 months ago and I love it for several reasons. To buy a kit and a months worth of juice cost me 90$ less than one weeks smokes. It now only cost me about 15$ a month.   Huge savings. Within 3 days I could breath better and my energy level was great I was also sleeping better probably because I could breath better. Now food taste great my sense of smell is better my sinus's are clear and I swear I can hear better.  As for the negative effects of the juice the jury is still out but Health Canada has said nothing more than more studies have to happen in order for them to make a final judgement on the product. Heath Canada also said that a product such as e cigs  is far less harmful than smoking tobacco. Heath Canada is on the fence and probably doesn't want to deal  with the politics of government and tobacco companies.  The American Journal of Science endorsed e cigs saying that they are no less harmful than having a cup of coffee other than the fact that nicotine is extremely addictive and hard to kick. FACT Nicotine in it raw form is no more harmful than coffee .  Juice ingredients (mine) Propylene Glycol  vegetable glycirn natural and artificial food coloring nicotine.  Reports from Australia Europe and China where these products have been available for 20yrs claim a 70% success rate among long term smokers. It is also reported that among long term users of e cigs heath risks do arise.  Pros It will help you quit smoking if you want to. Cons Not regulated and yes it can be abused by kids or people addicted to other drugs?  The long and short of it is do your homework and you have to want to quit smoking.  If the idea of e cigs/vaping is something  you would try I would recommend the Ego-650. This system allows you to monitor the amount of nicotine you ingest and counts how many times during the day you use (puff) the e cig The juice is available from nicotine strength of 24(very high) 18 /12/8 low in some cases as low as 4.  Good luck. Don.   
869636,adempsey,2014-08-27 02:00:00,1498,"I can suggest one thing with respect to quitting smoking.    A big part of it is your behaviours.    Try changing things up and breaking your smoking routine.   For example, you might smoke as soon as you wake up or with your coffee.   Don't do that and wait an hour or so afterwards.   Little things like that can make a huge difference when your trying to quit.  Ultimately you slowly ween yourself down and hopefully stop completely.      So, at first you're not really quitting so it's easy to do.   It's a good start and should help."

870305,Woodsman,2014-09-01 17:12:00,1286,"The best and only way to quit for good is to wake up one morning throw away whatever you have left and start a new life. The cravings go away after a few days but the associations take much longer. You have to change your life............change those things that you associate with having a cigarette. My toughest one was weekend mornings in the summer, get up early make a pot of coffee, grab the newspaper and my pack of cigs and head out to the deck...  It's not easy, but damn, it's worth it.  Do it for your family Brian, tough it out and you will get there. I can't agree with the underline comment. Great it worked for you but others have quit in different ways. I believe quiting mostly depends on motivation. If you want to quit bad enough you will. If not fully commited you will likely fail. What motivates one person may not motivate another. I've seen some quit over price, health issues/concerns, tired of inconvienience ect. or in my case not being able to sleep for more than a couple of hours before waking up for a smoke. I was a 4 pack a day plus smoker. Cold turkey worked for me but do what ever works for you. It's been 32 years since I quit. Congratulation Brian on your start of the process."
875168,misfish,2014-10-03 00:53:00,29133,"First off, thanks to all for your praise and helpful tips to getting off the stick.  Here,s what has come from the start til today.  I made a visit to a well respected vape shop here in town. I told him what my plan was.  Start at the high and get to the low as soon as possible. He said cool I can help. He was a smoker for 25 years.  I started off with 18 nic.  Cowboy smooth.Closes thing to a real stick. I used that little bottle up in a week. They say one small bottle is equal to a carton. I then went to the 12 nic the week after. Vaped that in a week and then went to the 6 nic the week after. Stayed with that for 2 weeks. It was getting to the point I couldnt handle that. Up in the morning,haul on the vape and start hacking. Was it working? I had told the owner that was an outdoors guy. Lots of fresh air and working out.  He told me,  I was weening off faster then those that sit around and haul back doing nothing, and my body was starting to reject the need for nic. Today was the last of the nic I had left.  I have a bottle of nic free here and still haul on it. It,s just that hand to mouth habit thing. Im sure in time,it will go away. But for now,I,m now vaping nic free and I,m feeling great tonight. 4 weeks ago, I was a doughter of this , but it has made the transition from quitting the sticks easy for me.  So when I go to fill up the new ride,I,ll be thanking myself that I did myself good. Not saying to myself,man there,s a $100 and I still need to buy some sticks still.  No,it will be,there,s a $100 well spent to fill,and I have extra $$$ to spend on some tackle or hunting stuff.  It seems the last 6 or so months,I wake up a happier and happier man these days. To bad I wasted all that money .  Oh well,the future looks brighter. That,s all that matters to me.  Looks like life starts over  at 50 for me.  If I fall of the wagon,feel free to beat me down. I don,t think I will be though.  Thanks again.  B"
875169,leaf4,2014-10-03 00:55:00,2466,"great to hear, congrats!"
875191,Nipfisher,2014-10-03 03:40:00,2449,Congrats on your success so far Brian. Best of luck in your continuation of NOT smoking.
875194,Old Ironmaker,2014-10-03 06:04:00,8243,"So far a great outcome Brian, new ride and a new life. If you talk to 100 people there will be 100 answers as to what is the best way to quit, most quit experts smoke. They are well experienced at quiting, we quit all the time.  October 14 is my quit date, my 60th bday. I've been smoking for 25 years, yes I started at 35. They should write a book about how my noggin works or doesn't work. I quit for a entire year 3 years ago, cold turkey was finally the ticket for me. I was told sometimes it only takes 1 to start up, I didn't believe that, I do now.  I want to quit now, again!!!!! that's the key I think. The hardest thing is staying quit. My 87 year old father quit 47 years ago, he says he still wants one occasionally, wow."
875197,spincast,2014-10-03 09:55:00,3279,well done BB.
875201,Raf,2014-10-03 12:58:00,3495,Congrats Brian.  I am in month 4 of my cigarette free journey using the same tool (e-smokes).  It worked for me since the first puff and I just knew it would -- havent touched a smoke since.  Was a 20+ year smoker before that.  I'm not sure I am ready to give up the vape yet though.  I would encourage others who are trying to quit and have tried other methods (I wanted to eat the patch) to give this a shot.
875202,Ralph Field,2014-10-03 13:00:00,1018,Well done Brian !
875207,Sinker,2014-10-03 13:19:00,8692,"Good job Brian. Im going to look into these things. Heard a lot of success stories about them. The hardest part for me is the habit....i think I could beat the nicotine, but I need something to do with my hands when I feel like a smoke....nasty, filthy, rotten habit. I gotta kick it too!! Maybe this is just what I need.  S."
869355,misfish,2014-08-26 00:09:00,29133,"Ok here it is.As I drag on a stick.   We have both smoked since we were young. 14 yoa. Both over 50 now.  The mrs,s got one of those fake smoking things last Saturday.. E smoke or what ever you call them. She has not had a real smoke since then. She keeps asking me to try it. I say no,,there,s chemicals in that crap. LOL Ya I know there,s chemicals in my smoke sticks as well.  So long story short,I finally took a haul and it was very harsh. She assures me,it gets easier. WHAT. Thought I was going to cough a lung out.  I,m all for getting away from paying 10 bucks a pack and getting away from the stink of the sticks. and getting healthier and living the good life,but  I have tried 3 times to quit,but put on the pounds. Whats worse,,weighing 230 pounds,or quitting smoking?  . She paid 50 bucks for the full kit . Two  rechargeable units and liquid..  More importantly,,the liquid, is what I want to know about.  I have seen many others using this new thing,,but is there more health issues to worry about?  Please don,t give me the, just quit crap. Been there done that. I have given up one demon already. And does it feel so good.. The body needs to adjust slowly here.  Club soda with lime slices and a stick, is working for now. Cuts the edge off. But, would love to get off the real thing if this stuff is SAFE.   Tell me your story about this E smoke thingy."
869357,Joeytier,2014-08-26 00:13:00,3990,"There was a multipage discussion on this stuff not long ago, dont remember the thread title, maybe someone can chime in on that."
869361,i2cool2fool,2014-08-26 00:19:00,349,"Chew on carrot sticks if you have too. I would think some weigh gain would still be better then puffing chemicals into yourself. At least with food intake, you can choose some form of a healthy alternative.  I know folks who used the e-cigs and all went back to the real thing.  Either way... Good luck!"
869363,Terry,2014-08-26 00:22:00,14456,"well your liquid is what it is all about it is said to have far less chemicals then a cigarette , but at this time it is unregulated so you really don't know what is in  it  but it doesn't have the tar in it"
869368,misfish,2014-08-26 00:44:00,29133,
869387,ecmilley,2014-08-26 01:56:00,2163,cant be anyworse than the cigs and if it helps you quit why not
869398,Joey,2014-08-26 02:59:00,9122,"B, I just bought the Nicotine quick mist spray.  Gonna give it a try next week. It was $51 so I hope it was worth it.   I'll let you know.   The mist cigs worked for about a week for me then did nothing"
869402,Garnet,2014-08-26 03:25:00,2056,Think I would get a real good handle on what you eat before starting this trial and stick to that. Any weight gain should be temporary.  I had to cut out coffee when I quit smoking. 1 a day instead of 10-12. Food tasted so good and the weight stayed.
869421,Gerritt,2014-08-26 11:25:00,6129,"I have a good friend who is in the e-cig business. He is not just a reseller but actually makes the liquids, you would be surprised just how little is actually in the liquid.   VG 99.9% USP Food grade Kosher Certified Vegetable Based (GMO free, and allergen free) PG 99.9% USP Food grade Kosher Flavourings Nicotine   Hope this helps.  G"
869461,Ralph Field,2014-08-26 13:47:00,1018,"I don't believe that the liquids are regulated. If you bought from Gerritt's friend you would be OK , but otherwise you have no idea what you are smoking. My brother in law switched to e-cig with no intention of quitting. He felt he was getting away from the tar in normal smokes. I used Champix to quit. If you're not ready to quit nothing works."
869463,Fish4Eyes,2014-08-26 13:51:00,1022,"I once herd that smoking is so bad for you that it is the equivalent of gaining 100lbs. When you quit, get on a exercise routine and take a natural appetite suppressant such as magnesium. Feeling good from the exercise will motivate you to keep the butts away.  I have a buddy who has been on that e-cig or whatever for like 2 years. I don't believe it works.  What has worked for me in the past is mental meditation. Look at a calendar and set a date a couple weeks or months out, and then remind yourself daily that this is the day you are kicking the butts. Also, for the first few weeks, don't do things that drive you to have a cigarette. For example: drinking, keeping your stress as low as possible, moderate or no coffee consumption, etc."
869464,Gallie,2014-08-26 13:51:00,1215,"I am using a vapor cig and it works awesome. I havent had a smoke since march andhave dropped down to 12mg of nicotine now. I will be done with the vaporizor entirely by next year. Edit. I work in construction and used to smoke 2-3 packs a day while now l only occasionly puff on this thing. If it helps me it can help anyone. My goal is quitting everything entirely and this is a means to an end, not a smoking substitute for life"
869469,Gerritt,2014-08-26 14:02:00,6129,"Brian as for the harshness or as vapers call it ""throat hit"" variable voltage units help control this. The lower the voltage the less ""throat hit""  G"
869472,lew,2014-08-26 14:11:00,12766,Heard on the news that Toronto City council has voted...or will in the near future...to ban the use of all E-Cigs on all City property....for whatever that's worth.  If you're not ready to quit nothing works.  Truer words were never spoken.
869474,John,2014-08-26 14:20:00,2956,"The best and only way to quit for good is to wake up one morning throw away whatever you have left and start a new life.

869488,Pigeontroller,2014-08-26 15:12:00,2793,"Here's the bottom line, you've both smoked for over 35 years. The Smoking is GOING TO KILL YOU. Do whatever you need to do to STOP. Lung Cancer is a nasty way to go."
869494,Governator,2014-08-26 15:37:00,879,I don't smoke but the result of an e-cig can't be worse than the pictures on the boxes of cigarettes.
869498,SirCranksalot,2014-08-26 15:55:00,3291,Do whatever it takes to quit. It's worth it. Best decision I ever made was to quit many years ago. Wishing you well in your efforts! Tip-----set aside the money you are saving and buy yourself  'treat'(Could be new fishing gear of course!!)
869505,AKRISONER,2014-08-26 16:33:00,5558,weighing 230 pounds is healthier than smoking. Any one in the medical field willing to back this point?  Being a bit overweight causes nowhere near the damage to your body that smoking does.
869511,SylvanOwner,2014-08-26 17:04:00,266,"I quit 3 years ago this September....love it.....whatever it takes is worth it IMO.  I'm not a doctor but I'm pretty sure some weight gain is more than a fair trade for smoking.  My boss is a die-hard smoker (no pun intended but......), I've known him for over 20 years and he is the most dedicated smoker I've ever met.  Pack or more a day, so not crazy amounts but he loves smoking and freely declares it.  He's tried to quit many times, as did I, but I've never seen him more encouraged than he his now with the use of e-cigs.  He's been ""vaping"" for almost 3 months now and experimented with flavours and strengths before he found the combo that he was happy with, he's since been reducing strength and is close now to the 'big day'.  He cheated a couple times during this time period but never more than 4 or 5 in an evening and he always went back to e-cig.  A few weeks back he cheated and said he hated the taste and actually threw a half finished cig in the fire - I never thought I'd hear of him doing this!!!!  WOW!!!!  He's normally very grumpy when he quits but this time he's HAPPY!!!!  Yes, still getting nicotine but he also did with other smoking cessation products and was grumpy, really grumpy.  I've heard him speaking with others, smokers and non-smokers alike about the e-cig routine, it's like I don't know who this person is....lol.  This is a guy who should be doing an infomercial for e-cigs and quitting, he's that keen.  Anyway, I could go on and on here Brian but here's what I think.  Smoking is a ridiculous habit....think about it.  All habits can be broken.  This may or may not be the way YOU break the habit but what do you have to lose?  For you, a lot if you don't try....I read your reports, life is good.  If you're concerned about the cost, you shouldn't be.  There is some moderately significant expense up front (at a pack a day this is less than a week of smoking real cigs) but even if it fails to work I can almost guarantee that you will save that money during the time you try therefore this is at worst case cost neutral.  2 other guys in the office tried ""going digital""....lol....and failed, they're back to ""analog"", after many weeks of few or no cigs, so it ain't for everybody but if you don't try you'll never know.  Good luck!!"
869518,fish_fishburn,2014-08-26 17:40:00,1311,"The e-smoke works for me. I smoked them nice little cigars for years. My buddy gave me a e-cig last year that he brought back from BC and I have been using ever since. I was off the cigars with no problem. My clothes and car doesn't stink anymore and if I forget it at home that's okay. I am at the office right now and vaping while working. My boss is ok with it in the office. Her opinion is if it keeps me from smoking cigars its all good. a few of my co-workers who started using them to quit smoking no longer use either. I went from 24 mg of nicotine to 12 and now doing 8mg and like I said if I forget it at home, no biggy, Im not dependent on it and have to run home and get it. A bottle of juice costs about 20 bucks and lasts me about 3 weeks to a month. No more hacking and coughing in the morning some its all good to me. I will quit using it when I feel like it."
869529,adempsey,2014-08-26 18:16:00,1498,"Nobody knows the health effects of the e-cigarettes.   The UN health agency just put out a worldwide recommendation today urging governments to regulate their use until health studies are done.    Although it might seem a bit of an overreaction, I think it's a serious enough issue that it needs to be done.   However, If it were me and I was having difficulty quitting smoking, I'd try it.   It's not likely to be worse for your health than cigarettes, and the worst case is, you'll probably save money and stop smelling like smoke.  The biggest issue is the children.   E-cigs are getting very popular with teenagers.   Nicotine is highly addictive.   Even if there are no health consequences, which I doubt, I wouldn't want my children addicted to anything.  I can also guarantee the next thing will be THC + nicotine liquids for e-cigs (if they don't already exist).   That will be a nightmare.  I find it somewhat humorous there are all these people are up in arms about GMO food, but e-cigs have far more potential to be dangerous."
869535,Terry,2014-08-26 18:46:00,14456,trust me they exists already
869538,Salmonidstalker,2014-08-26 18:55:00,265,"From what I understand, a lot of the materials in the e cigs are even more addictive than nicotine. They come from china and are not healthy for anyone. Do your own research and make a decision. Best way to quit in my opinion is to man up and put the cigarette down. Mind over matter."
869539,Gallie,2014-08-26 18:57:00,1215,Maybe not everyone is as manly as you???
