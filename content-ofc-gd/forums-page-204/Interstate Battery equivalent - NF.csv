882813,John Bacon,2014-11-24 21:55:00,3277,Is there a site or chart where I find equavalent batteries?  Mr. Lube recommended an Interstate MT-75 battery for my truck.  I figure that I can purchase and install a battery for a lot less than they are charging.  Is there a way to determine which EnerStart of other brand battery that would match the Interstate MT-75 battery?
882814,irishfield,2014-11-24 22:00:00,26272,"It's just a 650 CCA battery with side terminals. (looking at it... + on the left... - on the right)  I like interstates myself, and wish we hadn't lost our local dealer. Part Source has a good selection of on the shelf ready to go batteries, in various + / - terminal postions etc.  The hard part is finding batteries these days that will use the GMC and such hold down clamps.  Suggested retail on the MT-95 is $160.95 ! (list 180.95)"

882821,irishfield,2014-11-24 22:15:00,26272,"Make, year and model of truck and we can probably get further John! Suspect a GMC with the -75"
882822,misfish,2014-11-24 22:15:00,29133,"Awe that part. Sorry,thought you meant terminal connector.  Yes I hear you on that. Not  just GMC but the wifes Focus was the same. New battery was smaller, but I maquivered it. It,s a f us any ways, as you say.LOL"
882827,John Bacon,2014-11-24 22:28:00,3277,"Make, year and model of truck and we can probably get further John! Suspect a GMC with the -75  Yes, a 2005 GMC Jimmy.  They actually had to enter my vehical as a Chevy Blazer because the Jimmy was not on their computer.  I assume it would be the same battery.  Thanks for the tip about PartSource.  There is one close to me."

883228,John Bacon,2014-11-26 05:15:00,3277,Thanks for the tips.  The local Walmart didn't the correct battery in stock.  I picked up a battery from PartSource.  It seems to be fine.  I don't have to reset the clock everytime I start the truck now.

883395,irishfield,2014-11-26 23:01:00,26272,"Indeed Raf... but they do build to a $ spec for each of those outfits, so I wouldn't be so sure. We actually have a... musky fishin...  Johnson Control employee here.. but I doubt he'll chime in and I don't blame him !"
