883473,manitoubass2,2014-11-27 02:36:00,11391,thats no prob. see ya soon! lol. directions?
883504,Joey,2014-11-27 05:38:00,9122,"Throw a worm on a hook, cast it in, let it sit (secure your rod) and wait.  Used to fish rainbows in the Bow River in Calgary like that.  Caught one every time    good luck!"
883522,Rod Caster,2014-11-27 13:07:00,5784,"I like that method too! To be honest, that was my first instinct, worm and a hook. Now lets see if the 4 dozen worms in my fridge last that long, or if my wife allows it -can you see if the chinese food in the styrofoam containers is still good? haha."
883060,Rod Caster,2014-11-25 21:45:00,5784,"Specks are closed until much later in the ice fishing season, but when it opens, I'm considering trying to ice fish for them in the small river behind my house. Max depth is maybe 6-7 feet with lots of shallow/fast current areas. I'd likely try deeper areas just below rapids.  Anyone ever try this? I'd have to be very careful obviously but it wouldn't be impossible. I wonder if my chances of catching are any good?  This is a picture of JoeyTier sneaking up on a good pool early summer.  "
883073,misfish,2014-11-25 22:16:00,29133,Thats a beautiful spot. I could fly fish there all day.
883128,Musky or Specks,2014-11-26 00:03:00,2710,Man I really got to get to your place! Yes deepest pools below runs should produce
883131,Rod Caster,2014-11-26 00:14:00,5784,"This spring Brad! I could probably wrangle up Dana and Joey for a spec adventure. If Brian wants to give me a fly fishing lesson, he's in too hahaha.  If you have a camper, lots of space to camp on my land.  If/when I pull some specs from below those runs in the winter, that would be quite the unique experience."
883198,pike slayer,2014-11-26 02:34:00,1177,i've never really seen or heard of people fishing small rivers/creeks in the winter. i always wondered why but i assume theres a reason ppl arent lined up on them.
883200,creditmaster,2014-11-26 02:37:00,190,hey caster i i live on the credit river and ice fish but the key is TO ALLWAYS CHECK THE THICKNESS OF ICE AND MAKE SURE  the place you want to fish when unfrozen is about walking speed  and also always have a spotter on shore with a rope attached to you beacause IF YOU GO THRU THE ICE YOU AINT COMING OUT
883211,Christopheraaron,2014-11-26 03:20:00,3525,Well I can teach you to fly fish too   Post the results when you get out there! Just remember the current will play with any sonar and baits.
883297,Dara,2014-11-26 15:29:00,3052,It looks like there would be a heck of a lot of snow to get through in that spot...I would stick to lakes/ponds
883298,manitoubass2,2014-11-26 15:34:00,11391,"would a dish finder even work in 7 fow with current?  id be sketched man. I did this a few times near the rapids and one whole is 30"" thick the next is 4""  i tied off to a tree when i did it but I wont do that anymore"
883300,BillM,2014-11-26 15:36:00,17367,"I wouldn't attempt it, especially for some 8in creek specs."
883333,Rod Caster,2014-11-26 17:18:00,5784,"Definitely more effort to do this, but they do get to 16""+ and it's on my property so a bit of extra incentive"
883337,manitoubass2,2014-11-26 17:25:00,11391, specks through the ice would be an epic report!!!  you have a float suite eh rc?
883349,Rod Caster,2014-11-26 18:00:00,5784,"Exactly! No float suit, but a life jacket and ropes"
883351,BillM,2014-11-26 18:04:00,17367,"Life jacket isn't going to help you from freezing to death   Be safe man, lol.  Oh and get everything on camera!"
883353,misfish,2014-11-26 18:15:00,29133,"Me teach, na,but hey, if it will get me in the door.LOL  Like others have said. Safety first."
883357,Rod Caster,2014-11-26 18:32:00,5784,"Maybe I'll start a fire first just in case. We'll see how it goes, will certainly report on it!"
883375,fishnguy,2014-11-26 20:24:00,96,"I have done this.  Mind you it was on a creek north of Moosonee, and despite swift current, there was still over a foot of ice.  Caught some REALLY nice brookies on cleos and flies on a three way swivel with a weight holding them in place and a slow ""jigging"" motion to basically move them forward and back in the current.  It can be done, but be mindful of that ice. -b"
883383,Rod Caster,2014-11-26 21:29:00,5784,Nice! Thank you fishnguy. I like your method
883404,Joeytier,2014-11-26 23:17:00,3990,"That hike ain't fun in June, I bet it'd be a blast in mid-February!  You break trail lol"
883405,manitoubass2,2014-11-26 23:18:00,11391,start packin it now!  how far is the trip rc?  (you dont have to answer that if it gives away your spot)
883459,Rod Caster,2014-11-27 02:14:00,5784,"Joey, we walked like 3 kms that time! Probably not the best choice in hip waders at +30 after a beer night haha  Rick, it's about 600 meters behind my house and I have no direct trail to it yet. Biggest obstacle is the fast drop over the last 200 meters. It's a semi-difficult trek. Nice thing is no One else has easy access for a few kilometres"
883460,manitoubass2,2014-11-27 02:16:00,11391,can I come visit? lol
883464,Rod Caster,2014-11-27 02:25:00,5784,"Yes, but you'll need snowshoes for the winter fishing haha"
883465,Nipfisher,2014-11-27 02:25:00,2449,Count me in. We're talking about the beer night right? Either way. I'm in.
883468,Rod Caster,2014-11-27 02:30:00,5784,There's a zero percent chance we'll get an open liquor fine down there. Specks open in feb. Let's do it
