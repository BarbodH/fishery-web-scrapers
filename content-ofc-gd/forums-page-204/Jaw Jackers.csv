884013,Mr.Topwater!,2014-11-29 22:08:00,81,Just bought 2. Are their any artificial baits that can be used (hair jigs maybe? How would you impart any action? Bring on the ice!
884019,cram,2014-11-29 22:47:00,1733,Illegal in Ontario (i think).  Where'd you buy them?
884020,cram,2014-11-29 22:48:00,1733,I mean illegal to use in Ontario.  Not possess.
884021,irishfield,2014-11-29 22:48:00,26272,Lets not do this again... lol.. Cabelas I bet.  
884022,richyb,2014-11-29 22:56:00,774,oh boy here we go again ...
884023,davey buoy,2014-11-29 23:02:00,5505,Enjoy them if you have them!! Make sure you let us know how they work.
884024,Mr.Topwater!,2014-11-29 23:07:00,81,"They are legal. The bend of the rod provides hookset, NOT a spring."
884028,misfish,2014-11-29 23:21:00,29133,"They are legal. The bend of the rod provides hookset, NOT a spring.   YUP  Lock it now."
884029,Terry,2014-11-29 23:26:00,14456,"they are made for live bait,, you can't even really jig your line in it but hair jigs and minnow imitators and tubes will catch fish just sitting  there"
884033,cram,2014-11-29 23:40:00,1733,Sorry Mr. Topwater..  I thought they were illegal.  Looks like I'm wrong!
884045,fishnguy,2014-11-30 04:13:00,96,Bought a couple last year.  Seem to work pretty well for me.  Ran live bait on them.
