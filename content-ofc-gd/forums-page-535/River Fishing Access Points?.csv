585831,Lionized,2011-05-23 14:51:00,19,"After reading so many nice river fishing stories on here, I'm itching to get out on one.  As for access I've been told to just park near a bridge and walk it in. Anywhere and Everywhere.  Do Property lines end at the river banks then? River water is all public then?  I'm hoping not to get a shot-gun pulled on me by a land owner! Though it would add to the adventure and get some good photos on hear! : )  Cheers,  mark!  PS- I searched the forum first with no success."
585836,Joeytier,2011-05-23 15:02:00,3990,"River water is public, but I tend to avoid crossing private property, as it can be a little intrusive.  You shouldn't have a problem finding tracts of crown land along stream banks where you are."
585868,bigugli,2011-05-23 17:24:00,6138,There are some stream beds where land titles extend and include the stream bed.

585936,BillsTheBassMan,2011-05-23 21:13:00,932,A general rule is if the water is navigable (you can run a canoe down it) then it is public/crown land.  If the water is not-navigable (in the case of most streams) the creek bed is owned by the landowner.  You may run into issues with this if you ever do get pulled over by a cop though (as in they may not know the law and would likely side with the landowner.)  I have found that is best avoiding marked land or asking for permission first.

586216,BillM,2011-05-24 19:03:00,17367, There are very few rivers in Ontario in which the land owners have streambed rights.   Very very few.  Size has nothing to do with it.
