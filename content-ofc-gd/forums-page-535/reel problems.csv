585114,glen,2011-05-20 01:16:00,2641,You didnt over heat it.  Something is not right.  Maybe the thumb bar is not moving freely.  You did remind me that i have to check one of my reels though.  Thanks.
585115,OhioFisherman,2011-05-20 01:21:00,6623,"Was it a cold day? I can`t really imagine some one greasing it up so badly that the parts would be slow to engage in the cold? Crunching sounds in a reel aren`t a good thing, if there is a tackle shop around that does repairs it might be worth having them take a look."
585128,purekgw,2011-05-20 01:52:00,585,but the ting thats got me is as soon as it happened it just as fast went away
585130,Garry2Rs,2011-05-20 01:56:00,1425,"Did you oil the reel recently? The tolerances between the spool axle and the clutch gear that retracts for free spool are very tight. If someone puts oil into the hole, it can cause the gear to hang-up...This would ""cure"" itself over time, but reappear when the oil was cold etc."
585137,purekgw,2011-05-20 02:17:00,585,"nope its a new reel, it wasnt all that cold out when it did it prob 15-17 so i cant see it being the cold"
585145,Garry2Rs,2011-05-20 02:27:00,1425,"It might have come with excess factory lube. If you can remove the spool and wipe the crank handle side of the axle off, then reassemble it, the problem might be gone. While you're at it use a Q-Tip and some lighter fluid to wipe out the centrifugal brake drum...Factory lube often gravitates there between the manufacturing date and the time it's sold."
586273,fisherboy,2011-05-24 22:37:00,48,"I'm probably way off here. But did you check whether the line was caught between the spool and the frame? I have had that happen to me on my Scorpion a couple of times. The thin line just got trapped somewhere in the groove, and this stopped the retrieve completely as if something was locked up. Obviously once the line was pulled out, the reel is back to normal. Just one thing to check next time you encounter the same problem."
