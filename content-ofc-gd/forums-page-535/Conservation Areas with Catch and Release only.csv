586536,uglyfish,2011-05-25 16:33:00,981,"Binbrook does C&R for bass, walleye and pike. Crappie, perch, bluegill, catfish and carp u can keep.  Never seen a big pike from there, but have seen a 7lb walleye caught through the ice, smallies in the 4lb range and one or 2 over 5 and a largie over 6 caught. But they seem the be few and far between."
586585,Lunatic,2011-05-25 19:15:00,536,"Ive heard about walleye in there, but have never seen it myself. ive only caught crappie and small LMB out of there. i see pike get caught there often. as for C&R while some people obey these rules,at binbrook ive seen people ignore them more often then not. kids that work there pretty much shrug their shoulders when its mentioned to them. what can ya do."

586681,vinnimon,2011-05-26 01:04:00,2593,"  If you can find the clouds of baitfish on your ff, them Im sure that are there. But in all my years of fishing there, my pb is 9 lbs. But that was many moons ago. Ive caught a few others as well much smaller. But there is plenty food for them. So your chances are slim as to catching one. There a lots of decent size bass and crappy in there as well. My biggest thing is, is that the park doesnt open early enough. Heres a ff pic that fustrated me for a while one day last year"
586721,Lunatic,2011-05-26 02:37:00,536,"fish finder? never owned one. id like to one day,maybe when i get a boat. having a 300.00 FF in a 100.00 raft would be something haha"
