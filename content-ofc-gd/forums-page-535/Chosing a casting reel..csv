586285,fisherboy,2011-05-24 22:57:00,48,"Is weight a concern? If you want something in the sub-8oz territory for under $100, your best bet is Caenan. No need to think further. I personally don't think that Citica is worth paying the difference. It's not a high end reel. I seldom catch fish big enough to really ""need"" a metal frame. It's more of a marketing scheme for companies to lure bass fishermen to buy metal frame reels. Now of course if you're into bigger species or even saltwater fishing, it's a different story.  If weight is less of a concern, I would also look at the Revo S or SX. MSRP of these reels are higher than Caenan, but you can usually get a new one off Ebay for less than $100.  Another choice is the Cabela's Prodigy. Same as the older Daiwa Advantage. I have seen them on sale for only about $70.  Having said that, I think the best value stuff really comes at around the $200 mark. Curado and Revo STX are my favourites in that price range."
586335,kickingfrog,2011-05-25 00:35:00,8333,"I'll add a small point on the topic of metal v ""plastic"" in baitcasting reels.  All of my baitcasters are aluminum, but my diawa linecounter is plastic and when it is really cold out I have no problem holding the reel in the palm of my hand.  It's not often an issue, but something I do consider when it's early or late in the season."
583987,Live2fish85,2011-05-17 04:46:00,1633,Hi everyone. I have a question. I am looking at getting a casting reel in around $100. I have been looking at the Shimano Caenan 100 series and the Okuma Citrix or the Pflueger Trion. Does anyone have a choice towards any of these or maybe what is a better reel in your opinions or something I have missed maybe? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Chris
584146,mercman,2011-05-17 16:17:00,7054,"I have 2 Shimano Citicas,an E and a D, and they are bullit proof.Not sure how they line up against the Caenan, but i absolutely love them.They are in the price range you are looking at though.  Paul  "
584149,Mike01,2011-05-17 16:24:00,378,I bought a BPS Pro Qualifier Tournament last year and really like it. http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Pro-Qualifier-Tournament-Baitcast-Reel/product/10224165/-1673056
584150,uglyfish,2011-05-17 16:28:00,981,Quantum kinetic pt casting reel is a very nice reel and is about $109. I use one for flippin and love it. Very smooth and looks good. Great reel.
584155,mattp33,2011-05-17 16:39:00,290,"I live by shimano reels!  i have never had a bad one!  I would say ceanan, but i think your going to get a ton of conflicting reviews.  I have always been a huge fan of shimano!"
584156,bigmac1984,2011-05-17 16:41:00,193,"I use curado's which I love, but I recently picked up a caenan for a friend of mine and I've been playing around with it until I can deliver it to him and I almost don't want to give it to him.  I don't think you can go wrong with a caenan or anything more than that.  Check Ebay too if you are into that, got my curado's for $140 each, I think they sell for around $200 at bass pro."
584160,ah_long,2011-05-17 17:00:00,354,pay $20~30 more for a citica... metal vs plastic
584162,jimmer,2011-05-17 17:07:00,2730,"Pflueger President, a little more, but what a reel. Might find one on sale somewhere if you look."
584176,PainInTheBass,2011-05-17 17:43:00,102,"I agree with the sentiment of going with the Citica over the Caenan if the budget allows.  The Caenan has a graphite frame, and if it will be doing main duty for you, then perhaps the rigidity of aluminum should be considered.  At the $100 price point, I would go with a BPS prop qualifier.  They are very smooth, easy casting, solid little reels.  They are available in a number of different ratios in both left and right handed retrieves.  The dual breaking system is more flexible and forgiving than any one braking system.  Just my recommendation.  Or consider ordering the Okuma Cayenne online from Monster Tackle as they have an incredible sale on these reels at the moment.  These reels come packed with ABEC 5 bearings standard, which leads to improved casting performance."
584186,manitoubass2,2011-05-17 18:25:00,11391, I'll second this. Amazing reel
584241,Live2fish85,2011-05-17 21:31:00,1633,I am going to check out the Citica and the Pflueger I own to Pflueger spinning reals and I really like the but I will check them out and see what I find thanks for the help everyone.  Chris
584269,GBW,2011-05-17 22:39:00,8460,the drag in the Pflueger isn't as good from what I recall.  they may have changed it though buy now.
584282,kickingfrog,2011-05-17 23:09:00,8333,"i love my shimanos, but the new rapala r-type baitcast reel looks/feels very nice."
584284,GBW,2011-05-17 23:11:00,8460,I was looking at one of those too.

584527,Millhouse2020,2011-05-18 16:33:00,152,"Gotta buy what feels good to you and is in your price range.  I agree you will get many conflicting comments here and Im sure if you go with anything that was mentioned, you wont be disappointed.  I personally own a bunch of baitcasters, Shimano, Abu Garcia, Quantam and others.  To be honest, I have not had a bad one really but you get what you pay for.  More expensive reels seems to have better gears, balance and are generally smoother resulting in fewer backlashes.  That being said, I personally think the entry level product is much better than it was 10-20 years ago so you are getting more for your money.  The best tip I can give is be sure to maintain whatever you buy.  Last year I invested in some proper reel oil and grease and gradually worked through all my rigs and cleaned and lubed them.  Wow what a difference!!!  Some of my old equipment seems to work better than new.  Even stuff that has not been used will have had oil and grease dry up over time.  It pays to do regular maintenance, once a season is enough Im sure either before or after the season.  Some of these are nice projects for winter evenings when you are sitting by a fire dreaming about open water...  Just be dilligent when taking things apart or you may have a nightmare putting them back together.  I love my Abu6500 as its smooth, strong and reliable but man it was a bear to get back together, lots of misc moving parts..."
584533,Fish4Eyes,2011-05-18 16:46:00,1022, I'll second that. My drag on my Supreme stopped working properly after 1 season.
584542,Homer Is King,2011-05-18 17:07:00,305," Another vote for the this one!  I picked up a large version (6740X) last year for about $80.  Great reel.  I also have a bunch of micro Trions that I use for panfish and ice fishing.  I love them too.  I kids are now using them.  Even with the ""beginner abuse"" they stand up well and work great.  I think I paid $40 at PBS for them.  Plus they come with a spare spool (not all reels do!)."
584547,Dave Jones,2011-05-18 17:16:00,50,quantum resource is on sale at Canadian tire right now half price  regularly $100 on for $50
584552,JoshS,2011-05-18 17:31:00,729,Look into the Abu revo S too. I know from my friends experiences getting into fishing that cheaper baitcasting reels arent always a great investment. Look into spending a little more if you can and you won't regret much. Citica is a great option too.
584759,OhioFisherman,2011-05-19 02:13:00,6623,"Most of my casting reels for the last 30+ years have been Shimano`s, some Abu Garcia reels mixed in. Common reels, parts are readily available, if a tight budget a Citica isn`t a bad reel.  You can also check Ebay for a gently used old model Curado, good reels."
584771,Live2fish85,2011-05-19 02:28:00,1633,Thanks everyone after some PM's back and forth I have decided what I am going to get I am going to wait a bit and save up till I have enough to buy a Curado may as well just get the one I will want next. Saves some money in the end for tackle. Thanks Geoff and everyone else that replied.   Thanks  Chris
584775,mercman,2011-05-19 02:32:00,7054,"Good idea I have a Curado 300e, and you wont regret the wait.  Paul"
