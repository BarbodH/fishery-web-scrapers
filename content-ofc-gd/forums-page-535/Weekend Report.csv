Managed to clean up some items around the house and get everything ready for a long weekend at the cottage.  Friday night I took my youngest Jamie out for a boat ride and had a nice calm lake to play with. This also started the tradition of the weekend where everyone but me drives the boat lol    Saturday day morning I took my youngest out perch fishing. Met up with Ryan (The Urban Fisherman)and his two oldest kids. Well after a little bit we weren't catching anything and I moved away when my boy decided to use the boat as a washroom     But i forgave him    Back in we went for a change of clothes and he didn't want to come back out, asked my oldest ""Nope""! I was on my own. So I head back out and do a little searching and found my fish. Texted Ryan a couple times ""# 22, # 27"" and so on. By the time he crawled over I had about 80 fish. Mostly perch but a bunch of WGSF and OOS bass in the mix. I didn't take any pics but I finished with 102 fish for 2 hours. Glad to see Luke and Averie having such a good time.  I spent the rest of the day doing chores and relaxing at the cottage as well as troubleshooting the water pump that we replaced Sunday morning  Shawn (SRT8) and his family came over Saturday night for a bonfire and some fireworks which were a ton of fun.  After the water pump was done Sunday morning my youngest wanted to go fishing again   So we headed out and met up with Skinny and Vinnimon.  Again he drove lol    After casting pike lures at each other for a bit   I headed over to my perch spot. I put on a gulp minnow for Jamie and before I grabbed my rod he reels in a perch    I unhook it and go to grab my rod and I here ""Daddy I got a biiiiggggg one""  So I decide to leave my rod put away and just watch my boy school me, what a moment!    He wanted to stop for a bit so I took over and that's when Skinny and Vin decide to come over and start firing away with the camera      We decided to head in and I run into my wife and oldest son Jacob. We went off for a walk to watch some birds and Jacob asked to go fishing. So off we go.    He decides to school me as well.        After his arms are tired we headed off for a short boat ride. I decided to see how the outer bay was    I couldn't believe my eyes!    We went towards Port Dover and that's when I came up with a plan.  We headed back in and had dinner, I refueled the boat and we started heading towards the tip of Long Point. The kids loved it and we went over 75 kilometers that night.    I even let my wife drive back part way while I sat in the back and relaxed    We didn't quite make it to the tip because it was getting late and I didn't want the kids out on the water after dark but it sure was fun.  Monday rolls around and my buddy Matt rolls into town with a large double double    We were in search of pike but we wouldn't even get a follow. The wind and rain were brutal, it was rough and all we caught were many very large smallies.    But we had a hell of a good time.  Was a very busy weekend but it was one to remember.   Dan"
