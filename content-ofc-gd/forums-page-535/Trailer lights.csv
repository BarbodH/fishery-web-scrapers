I am thinking when they installed the hitch and harness they did not install a heavy duty flasher and the result is dim/slow lights. The other vehicle add a factory tow package and the Jeep did not."
586203,Roy,2011-05-24 18:32:00,13728,Jeep has a bad ground.
586205,aplumma,2011-05-24 18:39:00,6896,Test with jumper cable hook one end to truck frame and the other end to trailer if the lights get brighter then the white wire in your plug is not contacting well enough as a ground. Good call Roy   Art
586209,wallyboss,2011-05-24 18:56:00,1095,Yep  bad ground on vehicle .
586214,OhioFisherman,2011-05-24 19:01:00,6623,"Sounds like a bad ground to me also, it can cause all kinds of strange problems, and even happens on tractor trailers where you have the 5th wheel plate for a ground. Clean off any rust, spray some wd 40 on the ball and trailer connection."
586437,Billy Bob,2011-05-25 09:26:00,5865,IF the turn signals / 4 ways flash FAST then you need a heavy duty flasher...everyone here has steered you properely....bad ground somewhere with Art's idea being the best as a quick way to check.
