584235,skinny,2011-05-17 21:09:00,442,ok I was at BPS on Sunday there was a guide doing seminar from on top of the tank. He was useing a soft segmented bait pretty sure BPS brand too but the action was very real. I never thought about it much while I was there (on another mission) but now I keep thing how real it seemed to act. I whis I could remember what the name of the bait was
584319,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-18 00:41:00,1107,Was it a Swammer ?
584320,skinny,2011-05-18 00:43:00,442,what do they look like
584330,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-18 00:58:00,1107,"  This is the 5.75"" one it comes in 3"" and 4"""
584332,GBW,2011-05-18 01:04:00,8460,who was the guide?
584334,skinny,2011-05-18 01:14:00,442,not sure who the guide was if I remeber right he said he use to do salt water then moved up here and is guiding here now  the bait he had I'm pretty sure had treble hooks
584337,Bondar,2011-05-18 01:18:00,817,Simon Frost ?
584338,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-18 01:22:00,1107,  it would be real easy to rig with a treble hook .
584496,Harrison,2011-05-18 14:59:00,2202,Swimbait probably.  
584510,skinny,2011-05-18 15:31:00,442,pretty sure it wasn't Simon frost  I'm sure it was some sort of swim bait  I think he was also talking about catching pike
584962,GBW,2011-05-19 17:09:00,8460,the BPS site says it was Simon Frost.  did he look like this guy?  
585031,skinny,2011-05-19 21:18:00,442,I'm pretty sure it was not Simon. this guy was quite thin and I know he spoke about fishing  in salt water then coming here and going north and was talking about Pike fishing  I e-mailed BPS and have not recieved a reply and I know the e-mail was read
585122,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-20 01:43:00,1107,Paul Castellano or Derek Strubbs?
585216,skinny,2011-05-20 13:23:00,442,oh man I'm not sure of the guys name now Strubs does sound a bit familuar but could just be from reading it on line  i guess I'm just going to have to pas on that one or take a guess. It was just cool to see the action on that bait I should have paid closer attention but I was watching 3 kids at the time 2 of which were not mine and have different values than mine so it was driving me a bit nutty
585516,Bob Devine,2011-05-22 12:00:00,251,Salt water-local guide was probably Mike Bertleson from Huntsville. As for the bait not sure.
585616,2jack2,2011-05-22 23:02:00,92,"When you send email to BassPro, the email goes to the General Manager, which the only way you will get a reply is if he remember to forward your email to the fishing department manager, which he will be returning your email. If you didnt get a response by now, mostlikely your email didn't get to the fishing manager. The best way to find out what you are looking for is to call the store and ask to speak to the fishing manager."
585619,vinnimon,2011-05-22 23:07:00,2593,"In time you find out, why stress about it? You were on fire today  "
585720,skinny,2011-05-23 03:01:00,442,hey I went to Mike Bertleson site I think he's the guy I did send him e-mail so we will see what I get back
586106,skinny,2011-05-24 11:41:00,442,ok so it seems it was Mike Bertleson that was the guide and the bait is the bass pro Z9R swim bait  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Z9R-Swimbaits/product/10202507/-1600626?cmCat=CROSSSELL_THUMBNAIL#BVQAWidgetID  now to aquire some
