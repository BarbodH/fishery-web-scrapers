Unluckily, I was in such a hurry that I didn't realized I had picked up cream corn  so rather than taking a shot in the dark with soggy corn, I decided to try my luck with pike. 10 minutes pass after I switch to pike mode and I land this one:    When I brought it to shore, it thrashed its head so hard it ripped off the hook from my #5 mepps comet. Seeing as how that was my last good mepps (I pack light when backpacking along the shore), I switched it up to a five of diamonds spoon. The weeds were too thick, and funny enough, I had a big pike follow it with 2 feet of cabbage trailing (I heard they're aggressive this time of year and the scars on them are from pike attacks. Maybe it was getting ready to strike what it thought was one of its kin?). I had snagged it and lost it, so switched it to a green jawbreaker spoon. Never had luck with it, and today was no different. I had a husky jerk imitation bait in my small tacklebox that I've never tried, so decided to put it on. Was glad I did, because 20 minutes after putting it on it was fish on. Put up a 2 minute fight (would stay calm until I tried to land it, would then swim away). Luckily I didn't forget to measure it this time, turned out to be a 23 inch pike. It was hooked in two places, but with a good pair of pliers and a quick resuscitation it was back in the water.    Was a great day to be out. I finally got a pair of polarized sunglasses, Maui Jim Ho'opika in bronze colour. Was able to spot 3 pike follows, a bowfin (huge one), a couple of cruising pike, and the aforementioned carp. I'd recommend them, they perform great and look good without being too flashy."
