585892,Tootsie II,2011-05-23 19:07:00,162,This weekend's flyer from CTC has a 2.6 hp gas outboard tucked up in the top corner of page 31. Sale price is $ 729.99 . I suspect it is one of these Chinese units that we are now seeing in Canada. Anybody had any experience with their or other South-East Asian ( excluding Japanese) outboards. Am thinking about a kicker for my 14' wide body Naden.

Same goes for other things like gennies, one of the campers has gone through 4 different brands, he finally broke down and bought a Honda.  He doesn't even bring his tool kit anymore."

For the Price difference of $170, it comes standard with a 3 year warranty plus an additional 2 years on top (Merc Promo).  I personally think in this case, service after the sale for outboards is more important. Just cause our season is so short and who really wants to wait for a part to come in."
586086,redskullz,2011-05-24 05:00:00,55,I'd personally try to find a yamaha from the mid-late 1990's. Ive put thousands and thousands of hours on my 1992 2.2 hp and never a problem. You'll save some cash too! If you are buying new grab a Honda like fisherman said.

In a couple of years you wouldn't even be able to give the China JUNK away, where you can easily sell a traditional brand with almost no loss."
586244,jedimaster,2011-05-24 21:06:00,3472,"yup, stay away from that junk crappy tire sells. Just get a little honda, yam, merc, johnny whaveter finding parts will be very difficult. For example just go to the ctc and tell them you need a new impellor kit, coil, wires, stator and starter spring. These are all common thing you will need to rpelace over time. as well ask for a carb rebuild kit. Then think of yourself in 10 years asking for the same part."
