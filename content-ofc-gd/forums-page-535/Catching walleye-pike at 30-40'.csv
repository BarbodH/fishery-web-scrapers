586391,coreyhkh,2011-05-25 02:38:00,163,"Hey guys I have been on vacation and fishing Lake muskoka all weekend and I did pretty good around 30 fish largest was about 30"" and a number of nice small mouth I got trolling for pike. Anyway today I went out and a cold front came through I know that the fish go deep so I started looking for them and sure enough there was fish galore off the bays drop off around 30-45'. I tried trolling and adding weight but I could not seem to get down that deep. What would you guys recommend to target these fish,I am gussing they where walleye and pike and probably small-mouth too.  Thanks for the help Happy fishing:D"
586445,Jer,2011-05-25 10:54:00,1426,Vertical jigging with a good heavy spoon.
586482,johnnyb,2011-05-25 12:55:00,3413,"More weight....like a solid 2 ounces in front of a swivel....or a diving device, such as a Dipsy Diver, Pink Lady or Torpedo.  Beyond that, you could look at leadcore line or downriggers....if you feel like going on a real shopping spree Of course....there are a few lures on the market that will hit 30ft with lots of line out....Reefrunners and Deep Taildancers are 2 that come to mind right away"

586507,troutologist,2011-05-25 14:30:00,951,"One cold front does not mean a wholesale exodus of shallow fish, they more likely reduced the distance they were willing to chase and hit a lure, slow down and fish more methodically.  Roy hit the nail on the head..."
586514,manitoubass2,2011-05-25 14:53:00,11391,"Bottom bouncers and Macks wally popswork good at that depth or even deeper, I use them at anywhere between 40-80ft for walleye. Need a heavy bottom bouncer though, at least 1oz, but preferably larger.  You can always jig as well, either vertical or cast/retrieve.  But as already mentioned, your gonna be keeping some of these fish unless you have experience fizzing"
586541,doubleheader,2011-05-25 16:52:00,497,"This time of year the deep water is likely still very cold. Try a 1/2 oz bb on a floating jig head and go only fast enough to keep the line tight. This technique works very well in early season cold fronts and calm conditions, especially on breaks."
586612,Governator,2011-05-25 21:02:00,879,The simplest option is just a bottom bouncer.  Takes your line right down and keeps it off the ground.  Tie a 3-5' leader to it.
586639,coreyhkh,2011-05-25 23:17:00,163,Thanks guys I got some 1 and 3oz sinkers today at BPS I will try again in a few weeks. Also another question how do you guys decided on water colour to use especially fishing deep? I have around 60 lures and I can never decide what to use.
586726,ctdd2006,2011-05-26 02:43:00,531, I think in a couple weeks this post becomes irrelevant.....they'll be close to summer patterns then.....help me if I'm wrong!  Please.
586732,PikeMolester,2011-05-26 02:52:00,428,what is everyone trolling with for pike that all these smallies are hitting? It is mentioned in 3 pike threads.
586735,limeyangler,2011-05-26 02:58:00,5204,"i say keep it simple....3/8 oz Knuckle ball jig with a big (3""-4"") sucker minnow.....the minnow and jig shape keep it off bottom/snag free.  30' and you should just get to put 'em back....40' and their air bladders will be hanging out thier*&^%^%"
