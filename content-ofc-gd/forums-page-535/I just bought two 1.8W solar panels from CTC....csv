586884,fisher,2011-05-26 16:54:00,451,"They were on sale for $9.99, so I picked up 2 of them figuring they may come in handy for my boat...but the box says it will maintain a battery.  Does that mean they will not charge up a battery?  Would it be better if I hooked them up in parallel or series if I wanted to charge up my batteries - or would doing one or the other cause damage?  Anyone have experience with one of these? Thanks!"

Anyone have experience with one of these? Thanks!  Hey fisher i bought two of them on the weekend as well. Was going to post the exact same question just haven't got round to it yet. I did use one of them on the trolling battery this passed weekend and seem to do the job. That being said i did put the battery on the charger( electric) at night ."
586887,danbouck,2011-05-26 17:06:00,4380,They will keep it topped up but are useless for charging from dead unless you can wait a few weeks
586888,fisher,2011-05-26 17:10:00,451," Fair enough..I just wanted to see if they would ""top"" them up after a day using the battery for trolling, radio, etc....  Would connecting two of them to the one battery help any - and if so, do I connect them directly or in series?  Someone asked about the amperage - It says 125 mAh on them."
586890,Bigfisherman,2011-05-26 17:10:00,100,Your looking at 100ma in the best conditions. So for example a 50amp battery will take 5 days @ 10hrs/day of sunshine.......
586902,Terry,2011-05-26 18:08:00,14456,seems to me you will get 	.15 that's point one five amps 2 of them .3 amps not very close to maintaining a battery....  6 more of them and you will have about 1 amp and you will be talking business that's if I remember my electronic from when I got my amateur radio license
