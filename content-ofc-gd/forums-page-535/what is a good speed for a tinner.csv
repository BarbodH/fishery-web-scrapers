586426,BillM,2011-05-25 04:29:00,17367,No problem running over 30mph with our 15' Legend and 40hp 4stroke Honda.
585756,skinny,2011-05-23 10:32:00,442,Ok I have a 16 ft star craft tinner with a old 40hp evinrude on the back. Yesterday while out Vin looked at his GPS and with 2 in the boat and lots of gear it was out in the plane at over 20MPH it runs great and I love the feel I just wonder if I could get more out of it.  how do they determin how big of a motor should be on the back of a boat my boat is rated for 40hp. I might know where a newer 65 is (needs some work)
585764,scugpg,2011-05-23 10:49:00,1373,That seems slow for a forty if the tinny doesn't weigh too much. A buddy has a lund with a 25 and it does 24 mph with two people
585769,Billy Bob,2011-05-23 10:58:00,5865,"I would think you should be getting at least 25 mph....but how OLD is that old motor...  Many other factors play into top speed...does the boat have a windshield as that will rob you of 2-4 mph....width and depth....deep ""V"" to semi-deep ""V"" bottom...  Just to give you a comparison....my old 1985 50hp Johnson gets my 16'-4"" VERY DEEP (39') Grumman (side console windshield) that has a 84"" beam 30-31mph with all my gear (lots) and two full grown guys aboard....now when the motor was newer I could always top out at 34mph...but no longer.  Bottom line...you may have the wrong prop or that OLD motor is worn down...  Good Fishing, Bob"
585770,Roy,2011-05-23 11:01:00,13728,"Yes, it sounds a little on the slow side but I wouldn't be going past the boat's maximum HP rating."
585774,skinny,2011-05-23 11:16:00,442,the motor is a 1966 and when vinny gets on i'm sure he will state the speed i thought it wasn't bad for tiller no winsheild
585775,Fish Farmer,2011-05-23 11:23:00,2234,"Your only going fishing, as you say, your happy. The fish will still be there when you get there. As Roy said, stay within the Max. Buying another used bigger motor, you could end up with someones problems plus uses more gas."
585776,vinnimon,2011-05-23 11:24:00,2593,24 mph and Im not sure if Tim had the throttle wide open. My old 40 gale soverign outboard was about the same in the glass boat i had.
585784,skinny,2011-05-23 11:48:00,442,hey Vin it was pretty close to the pin  it goes good but i'm the guy that can alwas use more power
585803,glen,2011-05-23 13:02:00,2641,From what i have seen a newer 40hp would put you over 30mph.
585832,Pigeontroller,2011-05-23 14:53:00,2793,That '66 is a polution machine! Scrap it and get a new Yamaha 4-stroke!
585840,landry,2011-05-23 15:14:00,1005,"Depends how heavy the boat is. If it is a basic aluminum boat - that is slow for that motor. If it has lots of decking, livewell... then it is a tad bit slow but close. You could get 30mph if the boat is light and basic with a new 40 hp - but I bet you would only get around 25 mph and slightly higher. Does it really matter. If the motor starts well and runs well, then don't change a thing IMO.  BTW - if you need a trolling motor - my friend has a practically new one for $450 (minn kota bow mount, 55 lb thrust, 12v). I get nothing out of the sale - the motor has been used 6 times at the very most!!!!!"
585849,skinny,2011-05-23 15:46:00,442, hey I will gladly kick it off the back of the boat if you would buy me a new one not everyone has the money to buy new
585851,mercman,2011-05-23 16:09:00,7054,"  You have a good eye. My new Princecraft Starfish with Merc 40HP gets me and the wife and gear, doing 32 mph on GPS,and we aint no teeny people either"
585852,scugpg,2011-05-23 16:18:00,1373, There are low emmission oils that would at least help with the old girl putting out the smoke. That's impressive though its still running!
585853,ch312,2011-05-23 16:23:00,1590,my little 14 ft tinner goes exactly 40km/h with a 15hp yamaha 2 stroke. you need a tune up on that motor and/or a new prop to get er goin
585927,Keenan,2011-05-23 20:47:00,59, What length is the shaft?
585949,vinnimon,2011-05-23 22:08:00,2593,"  So there you go Skinny, your tinner runs fine and gets up to speed without any hesitation. And it trolls nicely and steady at the target speed I was looking for Why mess up a good thing. If your looking for more speed, then a prop change up would be ideal. But then again you would be up a little in the trolling speed. Leave it as it is, its not a race boat My boat with gear and two people, 40 mph. But I only want 30mph for the engines sake."
585954,skinny,2011-05-23 22:19:00,442,oh it's just a me thing i like it it does what it needs to and does it well your right vinny.
585965,vinnimon,2011-05-23 22:54:00,2593,   I will see about the one inquiry you asked about Trailer modification wise.
586189,Nemo,2011-05-24 17:25:00,727,I have a 14' Lund with a 15 HP 1996 Merc. It does 19 mph at WOT.
586192,Fish4Eyes,2011-05-24 17:35:00,1022,"14.5' aluminum with a floor and casting deck, no livewell with a 96 40hp evinrude and I get 29mph. I thought mine was slow, as I'm getting dusted by people in a 25hp. Im guessing its my prop. I will say it is very torqey though."
586226,Muskieman,2011-05-24 20:05:00,2472,"I have a 2001 14' Tracker Super Guide , loaded with the floor and livewell ,trolling motor etc... I run a 1998 Evinrude 30hp with a 13* prop and do 31MPH all by myself I weigh 260LBS ..and 26MPH with 2 guys and gear...  "
586230,bigbuck,2011-05-24 20:15:00,2449,"It's an old motor. Don't run it at WOT too much, you don't want to blow it up. If it runs decently, leave it be. You want much more speed, you need to get a new motor and that will cost you mucho dinero. As mentioned above, run some of the new synthetic oil through it to cut down on the pollution and enjoy the boat. Another thing to remember is that your hp rating is at the crank, the new motors are rated at the prop so comparing apples to apples, the new motors are more powerful."
586239,jedimaster,2011-05-24 20:59:00,3472,"I can run 28mph on gps full of gear and two people in my Lund SV16 with a 30 yam 3 cyl 2 stroke.  Normally I just get it on plane and throttle back enough to keep the nose up, put the feet up and relax."
586418,Sinker,2011-05-25 03:39:00,8692,"I also have a 16 starcraft tiller with a 40. It will run 30mph all day with two guys and gear. 3 guys, a dog, and gear I run about 27-28.  S."
