586788,misfish,2011-05-26 12:05:00,29133,As of last sunday the river was very high and dirty.I was very surprised. Must of been alot rain fall south of Barrie. Alot of the fields in Alliston were full of water ponds.  Your best to drive around and fish some of the smaller creeks.

I would not fish the notty as stated above its really high and dirty.  find some smaller creeks for some residant browns or bows but other then that theres not 2 much in the area."
