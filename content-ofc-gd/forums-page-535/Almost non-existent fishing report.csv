585901,Joey,2011-05-23 19:52:00,9122,"Finally got the boat out this year.  We were going through withdrawal and with the bad weather predicted for today, decided Simcoe was close enough that if it turned bad, we could leave if we had to fast enough.  The wind was terrible and we did more surfing than fishing.      We were targeting pike but all we managed was 1 perch each.  Mine was 10"" so at least it is a panfish for our team.  Paul's was even smaller, so he ixnayed a picture.     Other than that, after the winds picked up even more and I was starting to get sea sick, I tried to amuse myself taking some pics of the kite sailers out there.  Some of them got some pretty good hang time.              The wind was pushing all the weeds over and there was tons of flotsam and jetsam so the pike were not to be found.  Paul had a few bass follows but quickly pulled the lure away from them.  So, that was our holiday Monday.  Paul is now power washing the boat and trailer of all the pond scum from the river where we launched"
585920,Rattletrap2,2011-05-23 20:40:00,1652,"Well Joey, That is one healthy looking Perch you got! At least you guys got out and were able to try the boat out."
585928,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-23 20:54:00,2690,"Definitely some rough conditions, from the look of those shots!!  At least you got the boat out, you two will get them next time"
585930,Roy,2011-05-23 20:57:00,13728,You were just fine tuning the boat and equipment. Thanks for showing us your day....looks as though that wind would blow the horns off a bull.
585931,mercman,2011-05-23 20:59:00,7054,"Isn't that some brutal wind? But i bet it was worth the trouble just to be back on the water again Nice Perch too. All the wife and i have been getting are dinks, and, like your Paul, i wont be posting my dinks on here. People may laff.  Glad ya got out, and thanks for the great pics.  Paul"
585933,Terry,2011-05-23 21:05:00,14456,nice shots of the surfer  and yeah wind that's why I am sitting at home  my little folding boat would just be tossed around in wind like that
585939,Joey,2011-05-23 21:26:00,9122," I joked to Paul about that.  ""Wonder if Terry is out in his folding boat in this?"""
585940,Joey,2011-05-23 21:26:00,9122, Well dinks are better than nothing Paul!
585941,Joey,2011-05-23 21:27:00,9122," Ya, that's right, that's what we were doing"
585942,irishfield,2011-05-23 21:35:00,26272,Is he still scrubbin' ... got him out of your hair! lol
585948,Joey,2011-05-23 21:57:00,9122, That was the plan
585972,Fisherman,2011-05-23 23:16:00,7201,"Give buddy a little more wind and he'd be up in the trees, now that would be something to see."
585973,aplumma,2011-05-23 23:17:00,6896,  Is that why I saw you smearing a little extra mud on the boat?   Art
585977,Leecher,2011-05-23 23:31:00,7832,"Wow Joey, that's insane weather for the first launch but at least you got a nice perch    Me and Paul aka whitespinnerbait spent yesterday fishing in the rain   there was no wind and the muskitos weren't too bad.... thank god  Great shots of the kite surfer btw Thanks for sharing Jacques"
586063,splashhopper,2011-05-24 02:42:00,2931,kewl pics....
586076,fishnsled,2011-05-24 03:13:00,3520,Great to see you got the boat out for a run. It does look a little choppy tough. Should have hit Lake O for some giggles.  Nice to see you got out.
586115,corvette1,2011-05-24 12:25:00,1765,at least you got out better than sitting at home with all wind and rain except for the sea sickness
586129,Joey,2011-05-24 14:01:00,9122," Well Will, Lake O was one of our choices.  I'm ever so glad we did not pick that one to fish Monday"
586146,manitoubass2,2011-05-24 14:49:00,11391,"You gotta hate days like that. But it happens, and anytime in the boat is better than nothing.  Nice perch, looks very healthy!!!"
