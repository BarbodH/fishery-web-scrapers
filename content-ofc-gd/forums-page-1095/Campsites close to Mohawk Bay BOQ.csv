Last year I went to Pickeral Park which was good, but we did pretty well at the other bay so rather than run up there from PP, it might be better to get something on Mohawk Bay.  (Unless other bays are better, and I should stick with PP)  Thanks"

You're right on the water you want - it does get crowded on opening weekend, but it's like that all over the place. Things quiet down after that.  Lots of fishing choices being based at Mohawwk Bay, Telegraph Narrows, Long Reach, the Cables, Forrester Is and Mohawk Bay itself.  Lotsa Luck"

151879,Mike the Pike,2008-01-18 05:09:00,3421,  I don't think you can get a hold Of Dave the owner at this time of year he is in Florida most of the winter.If you send an email they will respond.  Its a pretty good campground and you are right on the prime fishing grounds.Always take a boat slip with bow facing  the waves .I am reserved for the long weekend in May let me know when you will be there.  Here are some pics of Mohawkbay Trailer Park.
