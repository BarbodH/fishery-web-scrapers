152040,irishfield,2008-01-18 22:36:00,26272,Don't think it moved bud...just couldn't remember which street you actually were standing on when you disembarked. Youngin coming in from Ottawa on SHORT notice.
152136,camillj,2008-01-19 05:06:00,1988,They actually offload inside now Wayne ... go in off Elizabeth there is a parking lot you can wait (or cruise around) in ...at least thats what I do when my youngest comes in from London
152204,irishfield,2008-01-19 16:42:00,26272,"Thanks, I found her!"

152225,irishfield,2008-01-19 18:49:00,26272,Wasn't a great area 25+ years ago Lew...hasn't improved for sure! lol The one nice thing about cell phones...they come in handy for quick locating in these situations.
