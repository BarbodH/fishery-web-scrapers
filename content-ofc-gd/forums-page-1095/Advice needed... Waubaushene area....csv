Have any of you EVER fished there or have you recently heard any type of report redgarding the action? Any advice or tips you can give us would be greatly appreciated!   GM"
152173,motv8tr,2008-01-19 13:12:00,2587,"Bring a shovel with you, snowing like a good think here right now....calling for squalls all day today....sorry I wasn't more help in the fishing dept. Grant, hope you guys have a great time, and if I wasn't busy tomorrow I'd join ya  Maureen"
152174,mcallister.grant,2008-01-19 13:16:00,327,"Mo,  Thanks for the update. I looked at the forecast and I seen that they are calling for squalls all day. At least that will limit the light penetration through the ice! That means an all day bite!!!! LOL.. I hope!!!"
152180,AzuluSpookd,2008-01-19 14:12:00,348,"Not sure you want to try there .....yet....  Before the ""thaw"" there was a village out there....  After the thaw....no huts remained, they were all pulled into shore....there is a very very strong current there, as they had opened up the locks at Port Severn to drain some of the water from the overflow...  With the snow from last night and happening today, I wouldn't suggest going out there at all."
152181,Terry,2008-01-19 14:31:00,14456,"AzuluSpookd thanks for the info I was hoping someone from up that way would jump in cause I figured the ice wouldn't be the best yet up that way but I didn't know for sure, so I didn't want to give my 2 cents worth"
152190,camillj,2008-01-19 14:54:00,1988,When I drove by last week it was OPEN water where the huts used to be ... Ive always been a little nervous about that area .. lots of serious currents  ... but listen to Wayne and Mo ... they live right in that area
152191,AzuluSpookd,2008-01-19 14:56:00,348,"Yeah Terry....I wouldn't be going out there right now, thats for sure. I've got almost 8 inches of snow on my deck, if not more and there was none on it yesterday!!! Its the real fluffy stuff, so these cold temps the next few days will help with the ice build up for sure. By the end of the week, should be fine."
152199,irishfield,2008-01-19 16:31:00,26272,Like Spookd says.... 8 or 10 inches of snow that wasn't there when I got back from TO at 2am ! and I wouldn't be steppin foot anywhere near the ice in Waub for awhile with all that flood control water pouring out of the severn.
152200,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-19 16:35:00,0,"As funny as this may sound. Wayne and Mo don't ice fish Wab.   Azulu Does and has been out this year. When the ice WAS safe!!! The channel can lose 8"" in an evening when they open up the locks. That's exactly what has happened. It happens every year when we get our January thaw. If I were you Grant, I'd stick to the Shallow bays of Penetang and Hogs bay or Victoria harbour for pike. I stopped ice fishing up there when they implemented the slot and number of fish you can keep. Not worth risking your life for 2 small fish. If you are lucky enough to catch one that is. It's a long walk out and if the squalls start, you will not be able to see back to shore and you can walk right into open water.  Good luck with what ever you decide. Lots of other places to go with safer ice up that way. Be safe!"
152203,irishfield,2008-01-19 16:39:00,26272,Doesn't sound funny at all Andy ! 'tis the truth !
152205,snag,2008-01-19 16:53:00,1932,One of my fav spots.  Definately get there early (5am-9am) or late in the day(4-7pm).  Good luck!
152226,irishfield,2008-01-19 18:51:00,26272,Underestimated that..went out to plow..up to the top of my kamiks.. 13 inches! Now coming down again at about 2 inches an hour.  This was a bare steel roof at midnight last night..
152230,motv8tr,2008-01-19 19:16:00,2587,"Yup GB not funny, just true. even when I lived there I didn't fish it, but have seen many others do so.  I've cleaned the diveway once already and will likely have to do it again before I head out to Barrie in a couple of hours.  From what I can tell lots of good ice on the north side of Penetang Bay, likely Midland as well although I haven't been by there for a bit.  Grant, did you call those numbers I sent you for the tackle shop and Pier 69? Maureen"
152280,mcallister.grant,2008-01-20 00:59:00,327,"Thanks for all of the advice gang! I will be extra cautious where ever we venture out to! I'll provide a report when I get back tomorrow evening.  Hey Mo,  I do have those numbers on hand. You've been a great help!  Cheers!"
152326,irishfield,2008-01-20 06:05:00,26272,10 more inches in the laneway from 2 pm to midnight ! And still coming down at the same rate ! Beautiful moon filled night in Barrie....but from Hwy400/93 to Midland.. 50 feet visibility AT BEST.
152390,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-20 15:36:00,0,be right nasty out there today from what I see on radar.....
152412,motv8tr,2008-01-20 16:29:00,2587,"Clear skies here now, but took me over an hour to clear the driveway...  Maureen"
152438,AzuluSpookd,2008-01-20 17:58:00,348,"Wow...did the driveway twice yesterday and this morning, the snow was OVER the top of the snowblower  I haven't seen this much snow fall in one day in a long long time!!!!!  ...............shouldn't have sold my sled"
