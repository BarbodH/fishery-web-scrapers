151690,OhioFisherman,2008-01-17 15:10:00,6623,http://www.nitro.com/boat/index.cfm?boat=2681  What do they sell these for up north?
151693,JustinHoffman,2008-01-17 15:17:00,482,"$24,397.  If you scroll down the left side of the link you provided, they have a spot you can convert over to the CND. price for comparison...that's for my postal code, but I am fairly certain the price is the same across the board.  Sweet looking boat!  Good Fishing,  Justin"
151696,OhioFisherman,2008-01-17 15:20:00,6623,Thanks Justin! Dollar dropping in value and they still want more for them up there? LOL go loonie!
151704,Roy,2008-01-17 15:38:00,13728,"Using this morning's rate, there would be a $600 difference."
151720,JorgeCarlos,2008-01-17 17:39:00,109,"'08 NITRO Z-6 w/Mercyry 115 optimax $20,995 cdn  ""08 NITRO Z-9 CDC with     mercury 225 optimax $50,395 cdn  this are special prices till Jan. 20/08 at Bass pro  Vaughan"
151842,Lostchild,2008-01-18 00:57:00,153,"Actually Justin the price is not the same across the board, oddly enough??? List price for Toronto  is $23 095  at BPS and couple other dealers."
151844,JustinHoffman,2008-01-18 01:03:00,482,"Hmmm, good to know, Lostchild. Strange, as I believed all Tracker Boats (Nitro) had ""no-hassle"" set pricing.. Thanks for pointing it out.  Justin"
151845,Lostchild,2008-01-18 01:14:00,153,Oppps!!! I took another look and was looking at the red price not the final price in black your right same price $24 397. My bad!!!
151846,JustinHoffman,2008-01-18 01:20:00,482,"Yeah, the red price fooled me at first - guess it's there for a reason!  Good Fishing, Justin"
151851,Guest lundboy,2008-01-18 02:22:00,0,"difference is probably freight, customs brokerage fees and duties?  It is crossing the border after all"
