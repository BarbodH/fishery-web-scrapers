152195,lew,2008-01-19 16:01:00,12767,CTC is advertising a Frabill 2 man shelter for $289.99.......regular $389.99  Thought someone may be interested.  I got this image from the Frabill site and I think it's the same one.....model # 6067  They've also got some Jiffy augers & a Vexilar FF for $100 off.  
152197,FishFinder,2008-01-19 16:09:00,481,Still too expensive if you ask me. Thanks for the heads up though lew.

152213,Mike the Pike,2008-01-19 17:17:00,3421,I have the exact same shelter and it is a great bang for the buck light weight to pull.I recommend for fisherman who walk out on the ice. Thanks for helping others Lew.        MTP
