Been to Kesagami before so I'm leaning toward cochrane and going to nettogami.  Has anyone fished through Sudbury Aviation.  We are considering Scotia lake.  Sudbury's a closer drive, but we only get to do this once a year and want to have a great experience.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks"

Bear in mind there's 2 camps on that lake, the island camp and the peninsula camp so you might not be alone. Between the 2 camps the peninsula camp is better IMO."
