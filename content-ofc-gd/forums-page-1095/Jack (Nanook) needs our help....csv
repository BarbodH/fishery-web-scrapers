151592,Garyv,2008-01-17 03:25:00,547,"After being in the same situation for the last 9 months all I can say is hang in there and try your best to keep everything as positive as possible.  One of my surgeons said it best...medicine is not an exact science, everyone is different and sometimes we have to fine tune our treatment.  It's hard to accept and do but being positive should help you in the long run.  My thoughts are with you."
151604,Rattletrap2,2008-01-17 04:21:00,1652,Get well soon Jack. Our thoughts are with you!
151632,Shelley Cooper,2008-01-17 12:23:00,394,Hope all goes well Jack....  Jackie.. chin up.. all will be well in no time...  Our thoughts are with you...
151675,bigbuck,2008-01-17 14:45:00,2449,My thoughts and prayers are with you Jack. I hope you have a speedy recovery!!
151689,Beans,2008-01-17 15:09:00,3339,I spoke with Jack this morning and he is feeling a bit better now that he is in a room and not stuck in a hallway...has had a couple of meals of solid food but still has the intervenious tube to ward off dehydration...  Tests so far have found nothing but he has one more to go with the proctologist and hopefully they will get to the bottom of all the complications    (pun intended) He definately sounds like he is in good spirits (No...not your kind Dawg)  Anyhow...that's your lot for now...keep up the good thoughts and prayers for him...
151691,Roy,2008-01-17 15:14:00,13728,"Thanks for the update Norm. Tell him that if he's not outta there in 48 hours, we're goin' in with a posse!"
151713,1leggedangler,2008-01-17 16:23:00,364,"Glad to hear they got Jack into a room. Being stuck out in the hallway in emerg is no place to get better. Hope they get to the root of the problem soon. Thoughts are with you Jack and Jackie.  Sincerely, 1leg"
151714,lew,2008-01-17 16:44:00,12767,"Thanks for bringing us up to date on Jack's condition Norm, and hopefully now he's on the road to a speedy recovery.  Jacks a good ole dood and deserves the best care he can get !!  Best wishes from myself & Diane"
151715,wuchikubo,2008-01-17 16:59:00,1114,Good to hear that he seems in good spirits. Best wishes for a speedy recovery!  Stan
151719,Daplumma,2008-01-17 17:32:00,1961,Thnx for the update Norm.Does he have a room with a phone? Joe
151725,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-17 17:58:00,957,"Jack, you're in the right place and they'll take good care of you.  Best wishes for getting back to normal in a day or two."
151752,Big Cliff,2008-01-17 19:14:00,6899,"It's about 2:00 pm, just got off the phone with Jack and Jackie..... Some Dr. came in and mentioned the big C word to Jack and was surprised he didn't know. Needless to say both of them are very worried and waiting to hear back from Jack's Dr.. Jackie has vowed to stay by Jack's side untile they get some answers... ""I wouldn't have expected anything less from those two"". Seems the nurses have agreed that she can stay as long as she wants to no matter what the visiting hours are. Good on them I say! Good thing they did or they would have found out what a fight really is LOL.  It will take a while to find out what is really going on but every prayer will help.... sure can't hurt!  Please keep praying folks, Jack would do no less for any of you!"
151755,Roy,2008-01-17 19:26:00,13728,Thanks Cliff.

151950,Big Cliff,2008-01-18 17:17:00,6899,"Jan. 18,08 update.  Well, I just got off the phone with Jack and they are doing more tests but they did confirm that there is some cancer but they don't know the extent of it yet. Jack thought he might be going home today after the bone scan and have to go back in a couple of days for the results but he'll be much happier at home! (Jackie might not like the nurses uniform that he got for her though LOL). he sure seemed excited about getting home though LOL.  Anyway just wanted to fire off an update because Jack doesn't have access to a computer at the hospital, hopfully he'll feel well enough to get on line soon!"
151952,1leggedangler,2008-01-18 17:23:00,364,"Thanks for the update Cliff, sure am hoping everything works out for the best and Jack gets home sooner than later.  Sincerely, 1leg"

151404,Beans,2008-01-16 20:43:00,3339,"Those of you that have met me know I'm not a very religeous type of person but, I do believe in the power of prayer...so if you happen to be communing with your Higher Power today can you spare a few thoughts for our friend Jack and his wife...  Seems the operation went well but complications have developed and Jackie (his wife) had an ambulance take him back down to the hospital in Peterborough Monday morning...  His wife is very upset that they took 3 hours in emergency before attending to him and, because they have no rooms available, he is stuck in a bed in a hallway...which also means he has no phone available and I'm not sure about visitations...  Jackie did say she would keep me informed so I'll try to remember to ask..."
151405,huntervasili,2008-01-16 20:45:00,1604,My thoughts are with him... I hope to see him get well very soon.  Bill
151409,motv8tr,2008-01-16 20:50:00,2587,"Hopefully it's just a reaction to his medication and he'll be fine.  As for visitation Beans, I'm sure there would be no problem, as long as a big crowd doesn't show up   Help him and yourself feel better and pop in and say hello to your firend....jmho  Maureen"
