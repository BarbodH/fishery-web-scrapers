151786,tonyb,2008-01-17 21:46:00,1637, You could always talk to Rogers to see if they offered email only accounts...or email forwarding service for a few months...Moght be cheap cheap...
151790,JustinHoffman,2008-01-17 21:52:00,482,"Good point, Tony! I'll look into that.  Thanks,  Justin"
151803,cantermore,2008-01-17 22:15:00,49,"Better get my 2 cents in as I do VoIP day in day out for Business strictly wholesale, I dont know much about the retail side but the packages on the retails start at $3.95 a month for unlimited Canada at http://www.worldline.ca/en/KW/index.html  and go up from there.  http://dsl.295.ca/Residential  has more home based offerings that start at 19.95 with DSL included.  Echo is thing of the past but can happen anywhere, bell rogers etc..  911 on VoIP requires that you & or your service provider keep the providers 911 database populated with your current name & address. When you call 911 your caller id is passed on; the police has access to the database so they know where you are but if you move & dont update your address with the service provider; when you call 911 the poilce will be going to your old address.  We can also port your existing phone numbers over to VoIP as well and pass them to your VoIP router or ATA (Analog Terminal Adapter)  We are putting up some retail code on https://didoasis.com/profile.php where you can sign up at $2.00 for a VoIP local telephone number and they just get pointed to your IP address.. All calls to that number then just go to your IP address where you would have a VoIP Phone or Router/ ATA hooked up to receive calls.  A note on power failures, yes your service provider has to provide you with battery backed up VoIP Router / gateway in order to get any service at in a power failure.  Johnny"
151808,cantermore,2008-01-17 22:41:00,49,"Forgot 1 nice one for Rick.. in case you didnt hear on the news; Bell Canada was awarded the contract to put up & operate Canada's ""Do not call lists"" and it should be operational by the end of the year if not sooner. Will be interesting to see if they still call people after they are on the lists"
151829,verno,2008-01-18 00:00:00,178,"The problems aren't quite as simple as that.  If you have VOIP your information doesnt always come straight through like a land line.  We have ways of telling that it's a VoIP call but we are still dependant on the caller (or worse yet a VoIP ""911 operator"") for the location and phone number sometimes.  We get location and number info from some companies, but it sometimes takes up to 2 weeks to update on the companies end.  I have had a hang up call where I had to send everyone Police,Fire and Ambulance, and 4 minutes into the call when I get the caller back she was at the other end of the city and had witnessed a huge accident with injuries in front of her house.  She had moved 2 weeks prior and had updated the company when she moved.  I have had other hang up calls that with the same circumstances but they turned out to be an accidental call where no one was at risk. Also with a landline, if you call 911 I have control of your line untill I decide to hang up.  You can hang up all you want but every time you pick up the phone there I am (sort of like emily but fat and ugly  )  If you are involved in a fight at home and someone hangs up, we arent disconected.  I have had this happen many times, and had someone lift the reciever again and I can hear whats going on and keep people updated.  Not so with VoIP. The ABSOLUTE worst is one company that uses a call centre called northern 911.  You call 911 and you go through to them.  They take the info then pass it along.  If you are lucky they pass half the information along.  They don't know what to ask, they arent familiar with the area you live in, problem addresses, people your local police are looking for, special projects in the community etc.  Not to mention, you talk to them, they call me, I talk to them and tell the officers etc.  It all takes time.  And most of the time I end up calling back because they don't get all the info. Calls that don't come through with the address, have to be connected to ambulance and fire a different way (at our service at least).  If we don't notice and try and transfer the call like a regular call the line is lost.  Now that's our fault not VoIP's, but it is a problem, and if you are having a heart attack, the cause of the delay is not going to kill you, but the delay itself might. Having said all of that, things are improving almost daily.  There is some big money to be saved with VoIP.  And realistically people don't have to use 911 all that often (thank goodness).  Just be aware of the risks.  As I mentioned above, it's not to the point where I would feel comfortable trusting my families safety to it.  But to each their own."
151836,Clampet,2008-01-18 00:34:00,1947,"Wasn't too long ago, (1990 ish) Bell, was the only game in town. They were a telephone monopoly.  Then they deregulated it.  People switched back and forth between different carriers for awhile, until they discovered there were no ""real"" savings to be had.  Maybe short term, in the way of lower long-distance rates, but not in the long haul, as we see the cost of basic services has skyrocked.  I remember back then it cost about $20.00/mth for basic phone.  Today it's around $80.00!  Sure I get a couple x-tra features, but they make up the money the lose on long-distance, but they take it all back and then some."
151882,John Bacon,2008-01-18 06:04:00,3277,  You should be getting quite a few extra features for $80 a month.  I am with Bell and I am paying around $30 a month with all taxes included.
151899,Moosebunk,2008-01-18 13:40:00,3970, I read this just last night and found it quite amusing.
151913,tonyb,2008-01-18 14:24:00,1637, Is there a way we can test out the information as it appears when we call 911 outbound on our voip lines?  (Obviously without having to dial 911)  Thanks for the insider information Verno! Tony
151957,Ramble,2008-01-18 17:38:00,713,"Their Internet service sucks, their phone service sucks and the customer serivce is worse then both put together. And to top it all off i went to use a pay phone today and they have upped the price to 50 cents!! It will be a cold day in hell before i pay 50 sents to make a local call.  -Ramble"
151517,wallyboss,2008-01-17 00:04:00,1095, Slowpoke Are you sure that your phone was never off more than once? Or you just picked up the phone once and didn't hear the busy signal? Bell has as much repairs to do on there cables as the cable company does. The only reason you notice more outages from the cable company is that when you are at home the TV is probably turned on.
151544,Crazyhook,2008-01-17 01:05:00,1154,Amen!!!  how many come back cards etc can you possibly send?? if you would of got it right the first ime you would not be begging for everyone to come back!
151550,danc,2008-01-17 01:30:00,4677,Holey... I'm on a cheap plan too but I have friends that I call weekly. Maybe you need to make more friends? Thunder Bay owns its own phone company and it's a great asset to us. We are among the cheapest rates in the country.  And the profits go right into the city coffers which help to keep municipal taxes down. And I'm very happy with the service.
151615,SlowPoke,2008-01-17 08:57:00,2984,"That's a valid point but I can only remember one time picking up the phone and not being able to dial out. I am on Rogers Home Phone after switching from Bell to Sprint and Rogers took over Sprint. Rogers keeps calling to try and switch me to thier phone/cable setup and I keep saying ""no thanks, I'll stick with the old phone lines."" We have cable/internet outages weekly and whether I notice when the phone goes down or not I can assure you it's not on a weekly basis. -Brian"
151711,Canuck2fan,2008-01-17 16:03:00,1444," I think too many people on here have phones for reasons other than THEIR convenience. I just don't call anyone long distance to ""chat"".... If I wanna get in touch I email, snail mail or how about just wait to see em whatever. It cracks me up how people can't live without 6 or 7 features on their phone lines. I live alone if I am on the phone it is only because I really value who I am talking too so call waiting is just that. You the other caller wait till I am off the phone to call me back. Call display? Who cares I haven't picked up a phone that rings until I hear the person's voice on my answering machine in over 10 yrs. Anyone who should be calling me knows this so if they really want to talk to me they know to speak up after the tone otherwise the call really wasn't that important. Doing things that way I don't get arrested for telling telemarketers what I think should be done to them ;o) I'll give you a hint it involved a legally sanctioned hunting season....  If you can't a hold of me at home and DARE to call my cell you get told that this better be a life or death situation because by calling me on my cell there is a good chance you are giving me brain cancer so it better be IMPORTANT... I don't get very many calls though I must say being ugly and having no friends has it advantages at times.  I got a laugh the other day at work the phone is ringing and ringing any my boss looks at me and goes aren't you going to answer that. I snort and tell him point blank you KNOW I don't answer my phone at home I be damned if I will bother answering yours here for what I make an hour. I am a delivery driver not a desk jockey..... didn't fire me either so I guess fishing is still going to be a part time pursuit this winter...."
151759,verno,2008-01-17 19:41:00,178,"If you have to call 911 call from your cellphone.  There are still lots of headaches with VOIP and 911.  It's getting better with some companies, but it's not to the point that I would bet my families life on it."
151778,irishfield,2008-01-17 20:52:00,26272,"Thanks Verno... and considering where I know you work, that's all I need to hear !"
151779,snag,2008-01-17 21:07:00,1932,"I'm still dating Bellinda,  As a dominatrix, she's second to none."
151781,JustinHoffman,2008-01-17 21:18:00,482,"Hello All,  I'm with Rogers for all my services - internet, cable, home phone and cell. Overall the prices are not bad, and I lucked in to a 1000 min/ $5 long distance deal when I signed up, that unfortunately they no longer offer. Got to like a deal like that, so I kind of covet it...  I did get some info from Primus last week that seemed like a very good deal. It was a bundle for home phone and internet.  Here are the details:  Primus Local Home Phone Service:  * Includes 9 FREE features: Call Display, Voice Mail, Call Waiting, 3 Way Calling, Call Forwarding, Call Screening, Call Display Blocking, Call Hold, and Call Trace * Keep your existing home phone number and phone book listing * Enjoy a worry free switch, with no connection or installation fees, and no contract to sign * Telemarketing Guard: NEW! Gives you additional screening and blocking capabilities for your incoming calls.  DSL High Speed Internet  * Unlimited Internet access * Up to 5 Mbps speed * Anti Virus/Spam * 4 Email accounts and 20 MB of Personal Web Space * 24/7 support * Add a DSL Wireless Home Solution from only $3 more per month!  Primus Unlimited Longdistance  * Unlimited calling within Canada and to the U.S., anytime, any day * No caps or time restrictions * No monthly network fee  All of the above for $69.95!! Now that's not bad. If you commit for 1 year, they drop that price down to $59.95/month...even better!  Have been thinking about switching, but realized one thing: my email account is with Rogers. If I switch, I will no longer have my Roger's email account, but I assume a Primus one. Unfortunately, all of my work and personal contacts have my Roger's email address. Yes, I could try to give notice to them all of the change, but I'm sure I would miss many. So, although it would be nice to save some decent cash per month, I wonder if the possible complications are worth it?  Will have to give this one some more though...  Oh, and if you're a Roger's customer, I just received a letter detailing all of their rate increases, that go into effect March 1. A sample of the gouge:  Home Phone System Access Fee - Was $4.50, Now $5.95 Hi-Speed Ultralight - Was 21.95, Now $23.95 Super Sports Pak - Was $26.95, Now $29.95 Basic Cable - Was $27.49, Now $28.49  And sadly, that's just a small sampling...  Justin"
151253,Beats,2008-01-16 04:09:00,543," I've never experienced an echo but sometimes if someone calls me from a Bell line and I answer here on the Voip some of my speaking doesn't come through.  Kind of like when you are losing a cell phone call and have to ask the other person to repeat what they said because every few words is broken up or missing.  But if I'm using the VOIP line here talking to someone without VOIP it all sounds good to me.  This used to happen a lot to me a few years ago when VOIP was new, but I can honestly say I haven't seen it happen anytime lately.  No one has mentioned the sound being bad in over a year I'd say.  I was always told it was due to the internet traffic going through the modem.  As in, it would only happen during peak hours.  It was really annoying though because the person on the VOIP line would have no idea you couldn't make out what they were saying and would talk and talk and then have to repeat it all for you."
151312,Gerritt,2008-01-16 13:36:00,6129,"I would never use Primus for anything... I was a network admin for Globalserv, they were then bought by Primus... Primus then let EVERYONE go... pretty much with out notice and closed the office. lol  Primus left a sore taste in my mouth..  G"
