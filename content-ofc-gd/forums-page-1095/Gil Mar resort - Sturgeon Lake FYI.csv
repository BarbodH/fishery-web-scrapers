Their son is taking control of the business, and he has other plans for the property, and will not be using it as a resort.  Not sure if anyone on this board has stayed or plans on staying at this location in 2008, but I thought I would pass the information on.  It would be interesting to see if they plan on selling off the existing cabins and run the property as an association.  Tom"

We have been going to Gil Mar for the last ten years for an annual muskie fishing outing, usually the second or third week in September.  I have frequented the resort in the summer with my family as well and will miss the grounds, it is truely a beautiful location.  Ron has been talking about getting out of the business for the last 2 or 3 years, his estimate for the property value was around 5 million.  The only thing our group could conclude is that they may possibly sell of the cabins and run the grounds as an association.  You would pay fees or dues for grounds maintenace and the owners of the cabins would be responsible for there upkeep and maintenance.  My friend has sent an email trying to find out what there intentions are, if I receive any additional information, I will gladely pass it on.  I have to agree that hopefully the property does not get into the hands of a developer.  It is a prestine location and should stay unchanged.  Tom"
