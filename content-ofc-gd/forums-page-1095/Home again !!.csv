152090,Nanook,2008-01-19 02:46:00,565,"  Hey Guy's, they kicked me out of the Hosp. today. I think they had had enough of me. Had a Bone Scan done today and I have to go back for a Colon probe.   The actual operation itself went fine, every thing working as it should.. Just have to wait the results and  start a plan of action. Ive always been a fighter, so between Jackie and Me, we will kick this thing in the donkey.  ""Donkey ??  Would really like to thank everyone for your messages, kind thoughts and good wishes. Gonna print them off, to help in low times, Many thanks once again  P.s.. I really hope the new Hosp. works out a lot better than this old one.  UGH!!!!!!"
