152140,kentooley,2008-01-19 06:13:00,208,Doesn't appear to be too many steelheaders here because they're probably out fishing.  I got out thursday morning....did ok...perfect conditions but it looks like thats changing fast.
152169,Rich,2008-01-19 13:02:00,3927,I don't know about other places but down here I think there are only 2 creeks open now and they both get pounded pretty hard (being that they're the only 2 open in the area). From what I hear the water has been either low or the creeks have been blown for several weeks now making for tough fishing.

152194,mikebuns,2008-01-19 15:58:00,12,the fishing is certianly slower this time of the year but there are definitly fish in there  im heading of today to wet a line and will post my sucess

152231,kemper,2008-01-19 19:25:00,2232,"The steelhead season really goes from late fall untill may, there are fish to be had all through that time. Problem is, the rivers dont always co operate. Right now there is lots of fish in, but good luck getting to them as everything is quickly becoming iced up."
152236,ccmtcanada,2008-01-19 19:52:00,7971,It's only over if you stop fishing the creeks and rivers.
152237,kemper,2008-01-19 19:59:00,2232,"...and you can always try the icebreaker method. Knock the ice out of your favourite run, sit down and have a coffee and then start drifting!"
