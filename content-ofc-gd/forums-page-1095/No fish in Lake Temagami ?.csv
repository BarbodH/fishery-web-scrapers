151716,tonyb,2008-01-17 17:03:00,1637," It's true I can accept defeat from the great lake...  but only for now...I'll be back!  I did catch a small Laker icefishing though and some Ling...just not what I was led to believe the fishing was going to be like when we went.  I know there are lots of fish in the lake, and bigguns too!  All in good fun! Tony"
151718,irishfield,2008-01-17 17:31:00,26272,Sorry Tony... just couldn't resist. Had to offload some of the ribbing....
151838,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-18 00:52:00,2585,ummm there are some great bass fishing in temagami.  its a monster of a lake so it may take some time to crack the lake but i have heard lots of great things about the fishing there.  cheers!
151843,irishfield,2008-01-18 01:02:00,26272,"LBH.. like many lakes up there they are becoming so thick they should just make them open year round with no limit. At anyone time I can stand on my dock and watch a dozen 2 pounders swimming around it. Agressive buggers too...this 19""r almost ripped my muskie rod out of my hand while throwing a 10 "" Mr T off the dock for pike..I thought!    Then the little lad Leah picked up last year.    Not sure what their main diet is...but I have some concern that it's laker fry on the rock shoals in the fall and walleye in the spring."
151902,Moosebunk,2008-01-18 13:51:00,3970,Beauty of a lake... Beast of a fish.
151470,Greencoachdog,2008-01-16 22:39:00,8163,"I've been watching this board pretty closely for a few years now, and to be perfectly honost with you. I've seen but a handfull of favorable warm weather trips to Temagami, and those are by people that fish it often and have been fishing it for years.  Sure there's a few fish in Waynes post, but it took him all last summer to catch them, and last year was his best year yet... and he's been fishing that lake for years!  On the bright side of it all, there is some beautiful scenery up there... we've seen the pics!     Now there's this thing about Nippissing I need to tell you..."
151484,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-16 22:55:00,1362,"Hey Wayne....I got so caught up on this post about no fish Temagami Lake and open water fishin, that I forgot to tell ya that me and the boys will be up there next Friday for the weekend targeting Whitefish and hopefully some eyes through the ice.....(it's our annual hard water get outa town and have some fun weekend!!)  We should be on the lake Friday by noon I hope.."
151509,irishfield,2008-01-16 23:34:00,26272," Hey Bernie....the ""No Fish in Temagami"" isn't me... If you look in the Dictionary it shows a picture of Tonyb and Aaron S ! LOL"
151511,danc,2008-01-16 23:42:00,4677, It would be a dream come true if everyone posted that there were no fish in my home waters.
151703,moose,2008-01-17 15:38:00,266,"u might need a scuba diver to help u find fish , iam for rent equipment and all , or use a guide for a couple of days , i know two good ones from lake temagami"
