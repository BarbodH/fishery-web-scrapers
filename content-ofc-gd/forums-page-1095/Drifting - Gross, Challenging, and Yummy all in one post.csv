151439,Jen,2008-01-16 21:49:00,833,"Went out a couple of days back with Uglyfish and Fishmaster to try drifting at Port Dalhousie,  After all the warm weather we have had it was going to be a toss up as to whether or not we would catch fish, but a day off is a day off... So we decided to brave the elements and head out anyways... As you all know you can not catch anything if you do not try... off we went.  The day started out at 6:15 am with me picking up UglyFish, a quick stop at Tim Hortons then to St. Catharines to meet Fishmaster for a 7:00am launch.    Water was mucky as you can see from the photos but we had fun none the less.  There were a few shore fisherman catching fish but otherwise it was a slow day all around...    A couple of interesting catches though...        I have never seen or caught a mud puppy... look forward to seeing one alive someday.  If you ever get an opportunity to try a chocolate fondue don't pass it up...    Had to add that picture because it was in my photobucket, it is the end of the day, I am hungry and was reminded just how wonderful it was!  Cheers Everyone, and Happy New Year!  Jen "
151442,fishindevil,2008-01-16 21:55:00,6254,"Well at least you had a fun day,and you were fishing,  so it beats sitting at home on the couch watching the idiot box !!!!!...nice fun pics too....cheers"
151492,huntervasili,2008-01-16 23:07:00,1604,Yup... a day on the water catching them ugly fellers sure does beat being at a computer or in front of a tube or working anyday...
151499,GbayGiant,2008-01-16 23:18:00,1780,"Eueeeueu, the mud puppy ruined the the fondue picture.  How about some mud puppy fondue ?"
151579,Joey,2008-01-17 02:28:00,9122,Well that chocolate fondue pic made up for the gross one of he mudpuppy Jen.  Great report  Joey
151610,Bernie,2008-01-17 05:06:00,3190,"I would be happy just going for a ride in the boat.   If you want to catch a live mudpuppy icefish on the bottom up here on Nipissing. Almost a guarantee you will get one. They are harmless. Thanks for the report Jen, it's good to see open water."
151611,uglyfish,2008-01-17 05:23:00,981,"jen i think u and i are the only ones who found them cute and wanted to keep one lol. too bad we can;t, stupid laws! it would make a cool pet"
151860,ccmtcanada,2008-01-18 03:15:00,7971,It's nice to see an open water report!  At least you caught something....better than a skunk and better than sitting on your arse doing nothing!
151861,Bly,2008-01-18 03:16:00,1556,"Thanks for sharing Jen......how an you have a bad day boating in January!!   Oh and the mudpuppy......when ALEX and I were kids, we did have a few as pets....lots of fun but our mother was not at all impressed!   That chocolate looks wonderful, thanks for the tip!!"
