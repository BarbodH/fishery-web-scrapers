151873,Ramble,2008-01-18 04:18:00,713,"The limit of 120 kinda had me scratching my head a little as well. But i totally understood the reasoning behind the crayfish transposrt ban. You guys should be glad that they didn't ban their use all together. The damage rusty's do to the ecosystem is extensive. If you want more information let me know.  The bait regualtions on transportation and things use are trying to stop oar at least limit invasive species spreading. There is about 140 known exotic species in the great lakes. They MNR is trying to keep them their.  If you want to complain to your MPP about something, compalin about the lack of regualtion and enforcement of ballast discharge from ships. If the critters don't get into the country then you won't have to worry about the MNR passing laws to limit their movements.  Their decisions are based upon trends and observations they have made in the field. Remember that they are protecting the fishery so it can be used sustainibly. They are not protecting the fisherman. If you think a regulation is dumb, they probably have a reason for it that is at least logical.  Try to keep an open mind when you read some of this stuff. It has to go through a lot of political man-handing before it becomes law...and we all know what polititions can do to a good idea!  tight lines fellas -Ramble"
151906,Moosebunk,2008-01-18 13:59:00,3970," I thought it was 144 - 12 dozen.  Best refresh on the rules.  My bad.  Trap my own and now and then I swear one trap has that and more.  I ain't counting, it's never been way beyond...."
151916,Terry,2008-01-18 14:39:00,14456,"yup  here is the cut and paste pg. #6  BAIT LIMIT NOTES Baitfish 120 Includes those caught and or purchased. See list of permitted baitfish species. Only resident anglers may capture baitfish, using the methods outlined below. One baitfish trap no more than 51 cm (20 in.) long and 31 cm (12.2 in.) wide can be used day or night. Bait-fish traps must be clearly marked with the name of the user. One dip-net no more than 183 cm (6 ft.) on each side if square, or 183 cm (6 ft.) across if circular, during daylight hours only (after sunrise and before sunset)."
151581,cisco,2008-01-17 02:39:00,597,"120 in possession and a minimum 5 1/2 inch size for minnows is simply a step towards the hidden MNR longterm objective of a total live bait ban in Ontario in my opinion.  The MNR rep who said the issue ""will be revisited"" is probably just stalling to get anglers to stop potentially crabbing to their MMPs or the MNR Minister or BETTER YET the Cabinet Board members about the restrictions.  If anglers go quiet hoping the issue will be ""revisited"" then after a bit of quiet the MNR bios behind the restrictions will happily run upstairs for periodic required briefing to the MNR Minister Advisors, and they will brag and brief how they have total angler support for the direction they are going.  Complain to the above three entities if you want to get such bad restrictions quashed. Maybe also complain to the Federal DFO since MNR is carrying out the the DFO (Dep't of Fisheries and Oceans) mandate since MNR is under DFO mandate re fisheries management in Ontario."
151619,Woodsman,2008-01-17 10:25:00,1286,"""Baitfish Only the fish species listed below may be used as live bait:""  The key word here is live. It is also illegal to use live smelt but in most places it is fine to use dead smelt."
151648,Marc Thorpe,2008-01-17 13:29:00,621,"  Thatâ€™s a dishonest way of managing our resource, using tax contributing salaried monies to impose minority and un-founded/un-proven reasons to regulate Are they not mandated to manage in the best interest of all and the resource? Not self or organized driven personal agendas or beliefs  The letter states it,Its obvious what goes on behind close doors"
151688,Fish Farmer,2008-01-17 15:08:00,2234,Who are these guys   (Names) that make up this stuff.
