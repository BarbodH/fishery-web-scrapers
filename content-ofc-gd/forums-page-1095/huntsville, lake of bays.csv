If you are wondering about ice there were still large sections of open water on the main or larger sections of the Lake as of a couple days ago. As far as the smaller bays go, I'm not sure. Personally I'm not hitting any of the big lakes up here for a while yet. Might be OK after next weeks freeze.   Hookset."
