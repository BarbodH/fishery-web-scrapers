151728,BENNY,2008-01-17 18:05:00,37,"Hello, Hoping someone out there can help with a site(s) to find used even new boats in the U.S. I have been searching google etc but havent been able to locate good classified site as of yet. Easiest is probably in MI somewhere as I am in North bay, thought the SSM route would be best. With the prices they are down there I am hoping to pick one up by spring for a sssssmokin deal , and the info on border crossing that is on here will only make it that much easier...  Thank You in advance for any replies.  Benny"

151742,Roy,2008-01-17 18:29:00,13728," Gerritt, since when did THIS happen??"
151743,Gerritt,2008-01-17 18:35:00,6129,I always thought that was the rule????????
151744,Gerritt,2008-01-17 18:36:00,6129,LOL my bad... but I always did think that was the rule... Sorry Landlocked!
151745,Roy,2008-01-17 18:38:00,13728,Never heard of such a rule. I have no idea what would have made you think that. There are links in almost every thread!
151746,kennyman,2008-01-17 18:45:00,737,If it was me I'd try www.kijiji.com and then click on each city you're interested in or go to http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites.html  . One more http://www.boattraderonline.com/. Good luck.
151748,Landlocked,2008-01-17 18:49:00,171,"No worries Gerritt! BTW, my three year old loves your avatar."
151749,Gerritt,2008-01-17 18:59:00,6129,LOL thanks man... it must have been a rule from one of the other sites I frequent and got mixed up.  My son loves it too!  G
151816,HTHM,2008-01-17 23:04:00,4082,"WHAT!!!!!!!!!,  there are other sites????????????????"

151826,icefisherman,2008-01-17 23:44:00,952,"Benny,  I'll PM you bunch of site from my archive....be prepared to search HARD and it'll pay off. I've spent months for search and went through tons of boats all over the US but mainly in NY, OH, PA, IN, MI, IL, WI, MN. Largest sellction by far will be MN, followed by WI and the rest. Some good deals to be had out there so take your time.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
