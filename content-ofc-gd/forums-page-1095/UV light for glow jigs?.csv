151788,goober,2008-01-17 21:47:00,14,Does anyone know where I can get one of these UV pocket/pen lights for juicing up my glow jigs/lures? Thanks
151791,Mark Kulik,2008-01-17 21:53:00,348,I saw them at BPS Goober.I have a small lindy one -works well.

151830,FISHINGNUT,2008-01-18 00:10:00,253, I bought one at the dollar store 2 summers ago and its still on the same battery. Heck you can buy 2 and still save 8-10 bucks in your pocket over the ones they sell at the tackle store.Money saved equals more tackle
151859,ccmtcanada,2008-01-18 03:13:00,7971,"We had a hard time finding them at the dollar store....turns out many have them in their ""security"" section...for detecting counterfeit money."
151863,goober,2008-01-18 03:24:00,14,bet you they sell rocket launchers at the dollar store as well..........lol......
151874,Mike the Pike,2008-01-18 04:22:00,3421,Picked this up Goober in October at BPS for around $5.99 works well after 10 flashes.Its pretty fast.  
151977,Canuck2fan,2008-01-18 18:52:00,1444,Dollar Giant has them in the Chateau brand and yes they are for checking your money and work great for that too. They even come with second set of the coin batteries for a buck and a key ring.... Probably the best deal I have seen in a long time for fishing LOL. I bought 3 of them and haven't used up one set of batteries and I deal with a lot of cash so I use it all the time to check if a bill feels funny.
151987,Fang,2008-01-18 19:47:00,1330,Dollarama sells a small LED key chain light that is super bright. I used it all last winter and through this summer on GITD lures. Still on the same battery and it really works good.  It's blue and about the size of a quarter on a key chain ring. You squeeze the side and the light comes on (insert OFC joke here). Just bought a second one and stuck it in my ice fishing box in case battery dies in last years model.
152006,Beans,2008-01-18 21:13:00,3339,Had my septic tank emptied and the guy handed me a couple of key chains with an LED light...
152010,bassjnkie,2008-01-18 21:18:00,1101,"Here is my story. I went to BPS for that $5.99 flash, and didn't like it. So went on ebay found a camera flash from HongKong for $4 CND. You can't look at the jig when you flash it, blinds you. The jigs stay charged for a while.  Thats my story.  Daniel OCH"
152036,irishfield,2008-01-18 22:28:00,26272,You guys with the flasher units must look like a bus load of tourists at Lake Louis... on a dark day...to the fishermen around you.
152055,drwxr,2008-01-18 23:44:00,453," UV light is better than camera flash, and its not the same."
152057,Mike the Pike,2008-01-18 23:56:00,3421,  Where is Lake Louis Wayne?
152060,irishfield,2008-01-19 00:07:00,26272,BANFF Alberta!
152063,Vtucciarone,2008-01-19 00:25:00,38,"My son got this CSI kit for his birthday, inside was a hand held blacklight runs on two AA,s.This thing is amazing! charges my cleo's better than any  flash.My son said I can use it but only if I take him fishing."
152067,Mike the Pike,2008-01-19 00:38:00,3421, OK I get it now ya I 've seen the very camera happy  tourists in Alberta.
