I know that used ones are not allowed to be sold, but thought I'd see if anyone here had an old one they'd be willing to give a young fella to wear...not while on a bike.  They also make or used to make bike helmets that looked simiar to dirt bike helmets....that would do as well.  If you don't have one any thoughts on where me might get one?  His fav color is red by the way  Thanks Maureen"
151777,irishfield,2008-01-17 20:50:00,26272,I can just imagine what the house is gonna look like a few hours after he puts that on Maureen.  I think all our stuff went to the two sister-in-laws for their kids.... that are a decade + behind ours in age. Will have a look around though.

You are still going to be dishing out some money($100.00 range).  Look for one that fits properly and is going to function the way it is supposed to.  If it is just to be a kid and goof around, CTC used to have some really cheap ones.  If it is for safety purposes though go to a real bike store and get a real helmet.  I might know of a shop that could help you out."
