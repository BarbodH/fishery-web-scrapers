151723,lew,2008-01-17 17:55:00,12767,"Thanks for that MB, another incredible tale, as per usual !!  I felt like I was sitting in the seat beside you while you were fighting those fish  My wife is heading to the Dominican Republic in a couple weeks but it's not with Air Canada so hopefully she'll have better luck getting there than you guys."
151740,walleyejigger,2008-01-17 18:26:00,876,WOW             WOW
151754,Kirk,2008-01-17 19:18:00,347,"Awesome report... Got a laugh out of the notebook, I didn't bring one on my honeymoon.  Kirk (just Kirk) LOL"
151756,Musky or Specks,2008-01-17 19:27:00,2710,"Old Moosebunk and the Sea. Great report, be thankful that they dont keep billfish anymore, I got a sailfish 25 years ago and decided to get it mounted. Hugely expensive and nowhere to put it eventually ended up giving it away."
151819,Ramble,2008-01-17 23:07:00,713,Sounds like you had a good trip.  1st time I have ever seen a wahoo holding a wahoo. hehe  have a good one  -Ramble
151823,mepps,2008-01-17 23:16:00,1301,Looks like an awesome adventure!!
151825,Minnow,2008-01-17 23:41:00,177,Amazing Report and Hooking into a Marlin is my ultimate dream! Thanks for taking the time to write such an amazing report
151828,TJQ,2008-01-17 23:52:00,7806,awesome report dude... quite the adventure!!
151834,Clampet,2008-01-18 00:24:00,1947,"Wow!  Definitely the winner as a ""Report of The Year"" award.  The way you described your flight from hell experience, to the whitewater shots (they looked like they came straight out of National Geographic, or Sports Ilustrated magazine!), made it seem all surreal like."
151835,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-18 00:32:00,2585,very cool report!  Cheers!
151841,jediangler,2008-01-18 00:56:00,1923,"Awesome, as always. That first locust pic is my new desktop. Nice photos man."
151872,sharper,2008-01-18 04:18:00,279,Awesome pics! very good read thanks!
151878,Fish Farmer,2008-01-18 05:07:00,2234,Man what a report.   My scroll wheel is wore out. Thanks for posting. It would take me a week to make that post with the 1 finger thing.
151881,scuro,2008-01-18 05:32:00,386,I am never going deep sea fishing...keep me on shore with Cuda and cute fish.
151900,Moosebunk,2008-01-18 13:48:00,3970," Bumped into one fella that had been fishing on the beach everyday for the week.  NOTHING.  Although, one evening a school of fish that I swear were bonefish were seen feeding everywhere and the locals were handlining them into their buckets in pretty good numbers.  Joey - buckets for washing blood off the deck.  Hooked - no biting bugs.  Thanks again all.  Was a long report to do up this one.  Will be awhile for another as my big skidoo is having it's engine pretty much rebuilt.  OUCH."
151515,irishfield,2008-01-16 23:57:00,26272,"Wasn't ""Captain White or Captain McLeod"" was it ! LOL Hope not.. or I'll kick them for you bunk!  Sounds like in the grand scheme of things... you had a GREAT time Drew. Too bad about the Marlin ""release"" though."
151516,HTHM,2008-01-17 00:00:00,4082,"What a wonderful report! I see the honeymoon was a great time, despite the nonsense from Air Canada. Thanks for sharing this with us."
151518,Moosebunk,2008-01-17 00:04:00,3970,"They didn't see it as too bad at all.  That's the way it's done Wayne, fish get's cut off once they get it boatside.  It's not like you can put your hands on a fish that big and hold it for a pic either.  It's like a thrashing 8 to 10 foot long fish with a spear on it's nose.  They don't keep 'em that size either where we were.  They release all billfish.  I found it weird at first cause I didn't know it was going to happen, but I understood later on."
151525,huntervasili,2008-01-17 00:24:00,1604,Wow Great report Bunk! thanks for sharing those awesome pics with us. almost like I was watching ya the whole way. Thanks and what a great time
151528,tbayboy,2008-01-17 00:33:00,1497,"Amazing report Bunk, your Marlin story gives Hemmingway a run for the money."
151529,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-17 00:34:00,957,"Hey Bunk, thanks for a fabulous report.  We appreciate your taking the time and going toall the effort.  I'll be passing this one on to others."

151534,BillM,2008-01-17 00:53:00,17367,That report was great!!!  Perhaps you should have brought home one of those ugly buggers for bait in the spring?

151560,Mark Kulik,2008-01-17 01:46:00,348,"Wow! that brings back memories , we loved Costa Rica, nice Wahoo, you'll remember that trip for a while!"
151568,Bernie,2008-01-17 01:53:00,3190,"That was a terrific report Moosebunk! The marlin must have been a blast. My brother hooked into a shark deepsea'n a couple years back. Same thing happened to him, no way they were bringing in the shark. Aching muscles for a couple days after. You had a great time it appears. Well except for your A+ report of the  E-minus Air Canada."
151572,douG,2008-01-17 02:02:00,2693,"Many thanks, Andrew.  Just a wonderful report."
151575,Joey,2008-01-17 02:15:00,9122,"Wow Drew, now that was a report.  I loved it.  Had to take a few breaks while I read it, but made it through and it was fantastic!!!  Love the pics and the stories.  I noticed the bucket under Bren in the fish fighting chair, is that in case someone craps themselves fighting a monster, hahahahahaha.  Thanks for the awesome report.  Joey"
151584,addict,2008-01-17 03:03:00,475,the pictures speak a thosand words very sweet trip.

151589,steverowbotham,2008-01-17 03:17:00,1800,"im jealous, and now more looking forward to my February trip to Costa Rica"
151600,Hooked,2008-01-17 03:55:00,891,"WOW, that was a stellar and a half post!  Were there any mosquitos out there, or similar irritating bugs like them at night?  Perhaps ones that can take yer freakin finger off?  Can't believe how freakish those bugs looked, and HUGE!  I bet a 2lb fish out there fights like a 20lb salmon here, what a treat all that musta been.  Looked like an awesome time."
151612,blizzcat,2008-01-17 05:51:00,92,"wow. great pictures! the trip looked perfect to me, great ideas for things to do, and it looked completely amazing. did it cost a small fortune?? (sorry if thats tactless. haha i'm always wondering how much things like that cost) nice post, i enjoyed reading all about your adventures, except for air canada being a big failure of course"
151617,Photoz,2008-01-17 09:50:00,792,"WHEW W W W W . . . . .   .
