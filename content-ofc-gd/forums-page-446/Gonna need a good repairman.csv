661401,Jer,2012-01-28 15:24:00,1426,They must have wired the drive to direct power to keep it spinning like that. Most of these new front loaders won't spin if you put a towel in sideways.

661421,Tybo,2012-01-28 17:13:00,1373,"One of the tech's at work brought in a washer and dryer. Hooked into the 20 tonne test weight with the 18 ton spreader and 18 ton boom. With the hydraulic working at the equivalent of 45 tonne and 1.5 feet per second.They where only 3"" high after. Realy shows you that their is not much to a washer and dryer."
