I found that the one I was using was hard to see in daylight, is that normal or are there better units for this application,  It was great in the hut though.  I will probally mount a tv in my perminate hut will this unit have a vidoe out option, and has anyone done that..  how long do the batteries last, and with a lot of snow covereage how much light do u need, can u fish with this unit after dark.  Has any one bought one of these and used it for a while and thought it was a apin or a waste of money.  Any and all feedback will go a long way in prying my wife's purse open lol."
