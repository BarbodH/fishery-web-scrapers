661332,SHINNY,2012-01-28 06:01:00,39,"iv looked around for a new float rod and i came across a 13 ft kingpin im8 for 180, is it a good deal? said reg 400??"
661334,BillM,2012-01-28 06:03:00,17367,Aren't they just Streamsides?
661336,SHINNY,2012-01-28 06:04:00,39,"dont know, iv looked them up on google but nothing really came up but i seen a guy on the river with one"
661337,BillM,2012-01-28 06:25:00,17367,From what I've heard the best bang for the buck rods out there are the Streamside and Raven RV9.
661344,denisk,2012-01-28 10:56:00,163,they are very very good almost bulletproof  i'd buy give me # if your not interested
661345,MJL,2012-01-28 11:06:00,2427, Yup. Only difference are the titanium Fuji guides and the sticker logo.  The Streamsides are decent performing rods at a great price (Around $130).
661385,Ralph Field,2012-01-28 14:43:00,1018,"I think that Jos has regular and upgraded streamsides ,with the up graded being  equivalent to the Kingpin rods and priced cheaper than the kingpin rods. I would call Anglers Outfitters in Woodstock and see if he still has some in stock."
661409,SHINNY,2012-01-28 16:00:00,39,so would it be a good idea to get it bc im only 15 min away from where the guy lives
661449,Ralph Field,2012-01-28 18:08:00,1018,Since you live in B.C. you may be better off buying from the guy 15 min. away. Certainly the option I gave you is no good because of where you live.
661450,BillM,2012-01-28 18:10:00,17367," I don't think he lives in BC, I think 'bc' meant 'because'  I still wouldn't pay an extra $60 for a KingPin over a Streamside."
661457,SHINNY,2012-01-28 18:43:00,39,"ya lol i meant because and i think i might just get the kingpin   another question, sliding rings or fixed"
661465,Spiel,2012-01-28 19:00:00,9065," For me Delvin, no question, FIXED!  Just need to know where you like your reel positioned."
661516,SHINNY,2012-01-28 22:44:00,39,  right in the middle  well just abit up from the middle so theres a little more room att the back
661556,Bill Shearer,2012-01-29 00:21:00,456," FWIW, there are $100 worth of guides on the Kingpin 13'2 pc rod. So $180 for the rod with a replacement guarantee from Angling Outfitters? No Brainer."
