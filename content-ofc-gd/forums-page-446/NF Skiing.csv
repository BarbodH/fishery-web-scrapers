We ski'd the upper bowls all day yesterday and it was unreal. 70 km winds and snowing made for some crazy skiing. Visability was poor. A few times I had issues with vertigo but other then that it was an amazing experience, standing on top of the mountain at 7200 ft and looking down is pretty sic.  The final run from the top back to Whistler Village took about an hour to get down because we all had spaghetti legs. Eight more days to go. If any of you guys like to ski,you really got to hit this place up. So far this year they have had 21 ft of snow. I did have a good wipe out yesterday but its very soft landing. Like swimming in a sea of dry rice and getting back up is tough. Tomorrow I am taking the Go Pro headcam out and hopefully get some cool footage. There is a few puter geeks with us and hopefully they will show me how to download so I can give you guys a taste of what were doing. Oh and the Apre at the end of the day is pretty cool as well. Cheers. Mike."

I can't wait to see your video, even though it will cause me to become very jealous and want to go more then anything I can't wait to see and hear more. Have a great trip and stay safe. Hope no one takes any bad wipeouts."
