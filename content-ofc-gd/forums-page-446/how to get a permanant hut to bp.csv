661328,Freshtrax,2012-01-28 05:44:00,2215,Anyone know another acess other than the billygoat hill to get my permanant hut off bp ?
661333,BillM,2012-01-28 06:02:00,17367,I don't think I've ever seen a permanent hut off BP...   And that trail is the only one I know of...  Goodluck!
661339,Freshtrax,2012-01-28 07:00:00,2215,Theres one there today. I have a plan i think im gonna try 20th sdrd. Looks like acces on google then tow allong shore from there
661341,misfish,2012-01-28 09:59:00,29133,"There use to be huts out there years ago Bill,but they were locals in that area,and of course,back then, there was always good ice to haul it down from BBP."
661343,flippin,2012-01-28 10:20:00,34," I would be very careful putting a permie out there, others are sayin less than 5inches an melting. tues +5. Becareful  if you do. flip"
661380,Rizzo,2012-01-28 14:11:00,4754,I heard 4 inches yesterday but apparently warm weather coming...save it for next year!
661456,Freshtrax,2012-01-28 18:38:00,2215,I was out yesterday.. There was deff. more than 4 inches where i was.........  I mean the ice is really unsafe dont come and fish there.......
661471,BillM,2012-01-28 19:08:00,17367,I guess it depends on where you are on BP.  Had a good 3 inches of black ice a week or so ago..  I'm sure after the rain and the freeze there is a bit more.  Although this weeks weather doesn't look very good for ice making.
661476,misfish,2012-01-28 20:00:00,29133,Cant wait for the mayday calls.
661480,BillM,2012-01-28 20:11:00,17367," Have you been seeing the helicopters flying over head like pretty much everyday?   I've assuming they are going to RVH, but I've seen one every day for the past 3-4 days."
661501,irishfield,2012-01-28 21:37:00,26272,"Yah.. they're not picking people off the lake. Ornge won't do that anyhow. I can tell you where one went yesterday, as our son got everyone to clear out the Tay Township yard lot and blocked it with a truck so they could land in Victoria Harbour.  As for ""safe"" ice.. it's only as safe as you make it to be. We all have our own thresholds for go.. no go... and what we go with."
661511,BillM,2012-01-28 22:18:00,17367,"Wayne, I usually let other people venture out before me.  No way I'm putting my life in danger for a silly fish!"
661515,Freshtrax,2012-01-28 22:43:00,2215,"""As for ""safe"" ice.. it's only as safe as you make it to be. We all have our own thresholds for go.. no go... and what we go with."". I couldent agree more.. I have bin fishing simcoe for 23 years have havent bin for a swim yet.  Came close about 15years ago myself my father and my grandpa went to get our huts off at the end of the season. Ice was fine all day..on the way home it had blown 60ft off shore. I wish i had a camcorder that day waterskipping a bravo 250 with an iceshack in tow..."
661531,Rizzo,2012-01-28 23:23:00,4754, haha that would have been hilarious. I'll admit the thought of being set adrift certainly entered my mind when we went to Lefroy yesterday. Winds were supposed to be from the west at 40 kms. Turns out they weren't and we didn't have to make a run for it
661535,misfish,2012-01-28 23:27:00,29133,   HAHAHAHA
661626,Freshtrax,2012-01-29 04:02:00,2215,I chickened out just got home from droppin the hut at the end of gillford rd.  Its the big ugly green one ill drag it out in the afternoon after I chase lakers in the am.   My final decision was based on heaven forbid having to get that hut up the hill.
