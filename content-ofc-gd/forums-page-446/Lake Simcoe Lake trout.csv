661062,rhare,2012-01-27 14:54:00,387,Hey everyone  Well the ice season has been dismal to say the least. The ice conditions are really unstable and not much of a surprise with the weather we've been having. I have been out checking the ice and playing a bit and was fortunate to get into some decent lakers already this season.  Xzone swammers and Bass magnet tubes in pearl have been our best producers.  here's a bit of Laker porn...                               Here are a couple video's for anyone looking to pass some time...           Lets hope the season gets going sooner or later...  tightlines  Ryan
