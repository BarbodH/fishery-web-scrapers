I wasn't impressed with having to replace my tip up after they broke so I decided to yet again try another brand this year.. Wasn't pleased.. So I sent an email to HT enterprises explaining that I like their product but couldn't justify buying new tip up every year and didn't want to have to resort to finding parts to replace them my self. They emailed me back and told me they were sorry to hear I had a problem with the flags breaking and they would send some out for me asap. Well it's still ice season and I just received 3 flags shipped free of charge and hassle!!    It not a very big deal but I can now get my two broken tip ups back in action, have a back up plus an extra flag. It's always nice when thing go the way you want them too. Thank you HT Enterprises."
661157,Big Cliff,2012-01-27 20:31:00,6899,That's the kind of customer service that makes me want to buy their product! Thanks for posting!
661159,kickingfrog,2012-01-27 20:35:00,8333,Great that they stepped up.  But did they offer any suggestions as to why they broke in the first place?
661161,GoneFishin,2012-01-27 20:46:00,349," I use my tip-ups a lot usually. So after moving them around and storing them as much as I do, I tend to not be as careful as I should be with them. It's a problem that could easily be blamed on user error, but wasn't!"
