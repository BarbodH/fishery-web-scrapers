660925,DMASSE,2012-01-27 02:40:00,420,"HELLO  Well its been awhile since I posted a fishing report here on OFC, especially with a new personal best.  Yesterday Wed acouple of buddies of mine and myself decided to fish LADY SIMCOE for some hot perch action.  We arrived in the early morning and set up the portables in 10-13ft of water right next to the ice road,  if you know the ice road you will know where I am talking about   Right away we were on fish, 10-12 in jumbos, small 5-8 inch fish,  they would show up in 10-12 minute waves,  like clock work they circles the huts.  The marcum underwater camera was a great asset, and most fish were caught on a slab grabbers or rapala jigging minnow ( perch)  When the day started to end and the night showed up is when I caught a great number of 12 + inch fish  We switched to MOONGLOW MINNOWS and that is when we landed 12.6, 12.8, 13.1, 13.1, 13.4  and finally ended with a whopping 15.6 inch perch, my personal record.  Here are some pictures of the fish with some smaller one mixed in to show the size of the fish      Thanks for looking  Dave"

660940,J-M,2012-01-27 03:01:00,65,That perch is a TANK. Gotta love how it dwarfs average sized perch. Did you say you caught your jumbos at night? Or at dusk? I always thought perch shutdown right after dusk...  Awesome Report!
660942,bassassin,2012-01-27 03:04:00,152,"no need to round up .6"" jk, that's a monster you can fish for jumbos for the rest of your life and never even tie that fish in size never mind surpassing it! As far as perch are concerned that fish can not be beat!  Jason"
660945,206,2012-01-27 03:16:00,563,Wow that is jumbo!  Not to steal a thread but the only one i caught that compares to that was on the Bay of Quinte and it looked like a dinosaur.  How old would you guess a perch that size to be?
660946,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-27 03:20:00,2690,Very nice.  Hoping to get into a few of those jumbos on Sunday. Congrats on the PB.
