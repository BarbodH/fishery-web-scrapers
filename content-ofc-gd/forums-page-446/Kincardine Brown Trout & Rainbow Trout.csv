661175,spinnerbaitking,2012-01-27 21:52:00,1622,"They do have tours of the Hatcheries but I'm not sure when & if it worked out I could take a few Guys &/or Girls for a tour as I have a key for the one in Kincardine & could likely get a Tour set up for the Port Elgin Salmon Hatchery if there was enough interest, send me a message if Interested, We could start a post to see if we could pick a Date that works for a few of you SBK"
