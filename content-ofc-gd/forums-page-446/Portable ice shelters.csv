661329,Eazy,2012-01-28 05:44:00,260,"On a recent outing, which included some nasty elements,such as rain and wind,(yeup....rain in January!), my partner brought along his portable ice-shelter which pretty much saved the day.  That being said, I've decided to make it a priority to purchase one of these shelters, but have noticed that the market is flooded with options when it comes to these.....Id be looking for something that when folded down would fit into a med otter sleigh....  Any suggestions?"
661335,BillM,2012-01-28 06:03:00,17367,Why not go with something like a Clam that's an all-in-one?
661351,Big Cliff,2012-01-28 12:09:00,6899,"I got a 4 man Sub Zero for Christmas a couple of years ago and I love it. Sets up in about 2 minutes, folds down into a handy carrying bag, weighs 23 lbs. Very comfortable for two guys, gear and a heater, a little crowded with 3 guys, 4 guys and you would want to be really good friends and store your gear outside. I think it was on special at CTC for under $300.00."
661352,Nipfisher,2012-01-28 12:14:00,2449,My friend recently purchased the Clam Twin Hub II which he really likes. Simple to set up and light. Will fit in a med. sleigh no problem. Twin Hub II
661353,bigugli,2012-01-28 12:15:00,6138,HT makes a lightweight backpack style flip hut for 1 or 2 persons. Initial convenience is offset by poor quality materials. Hinge pins snap easy. Stitching often has to be mended. I moved to a clam style. Allows me to haul all in one.
661357,strik,2012-01-28 12:50:00,175,i have the eskimo quick fish 3 pop up  it has been great  thinkk they are around 250  best of luck
661369,jim,2012-01-28 13:41:00,124,"I have a Clam Base camp. 3 man, 6'-6"" tall.  Good quality, roomy, easy set up. Fits in small Otter sled, along with power auger and other gear.  I think I paid under $200. At Sail.  Its A hub style tent, so it pops up , and down, easily."
661373,mike rousseau,2012-01-28 13:57:00,4661,If you like to run and gun... Get a flip over sled base shack  If you drill and sit in one place... Hub/pop ups are nice for the extra room...
661459,Acountdeleted,2012-01-28 18:51:00,2562,How durable are the hub/pop ups? I was looking at a few on sale today and they look like the far better deal then the all in one collapsable ones. Only thing I worry is if a strong breeze (like today) would take em out.
661474,Big Cliff,2012-01-28 19:46:00,6899,I've had mine out in 35k winds no problem. A little hard to set up when it is that windy though
661488,Spouph,2012-01-28 20:47:00,115,"  I love my clam, single person flip up insulated top, comfortable chair, all day fishing.  I don't have sled and I can easily drag this thinkg all over the lake.  I sold 2 ht 2 pearson hut I loved the room but it severly limited the distance I could fish.  Insulated top is the only wat to go.  The less space you have the less you carry.  It's a little tight after 8 hrs of fishing though.  definatly recomend you look at these."
