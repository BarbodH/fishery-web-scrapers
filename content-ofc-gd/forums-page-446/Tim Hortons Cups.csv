That said after work today I realized I had not had my usual 3 cups of java so I broke down and bought the new XL at Timmies. Same sub par coffee just more of it LOL. Since they changed roasters from Mother Parkers to do it themselves, they have been living off their name and the habits of people who have trained their cars to go through that drive thru. (just to give you an idea what I mean I used to deliver to a coffee franchise that had a drive thru on my bread route, I got hit 4 times in that parking lot carrying in the order ALL by people who nodded for me to go ahead then they would look down for change or zone out and bump me with the car as I was walking by. Anyone who doesn't believe zombies exist never took the walk of death through that parking lot LOL)  As for who can drink 24ozs of coffee, I swithced from a 12 cup brewer to an 8 cup at home to cut down on my consumption on the days I don't work in the morning....
