661416,BillM,2012-01-28 16:46:00,17367,"Sounds about right.  A buddy of mine said the same thing..  Caught 300 or so kept 8, lol."
661425,MJL,2012-01-28 17:19:00,2427,"So theoretically speaking, when I head out tomorrow, the probability of catching larger ones will increase because all the smaller ones have already been caught...SWEET  Thanks for report...Definitely itchin to get out on the ice just for about anything"
661453,Rizzo,2012-01-28 18:25:00,4754, think of the stupid sunfish at the end of the dock who will get caught over and over and over in a matter of minutes. Now picture a million tiny perch under your feet doing the same thing
661536,EC1,2012-01-28 23:28:00,930,Take a look at what the guys are doing in 50 fow tomorrow mike. Ran into the same thing shallower to deeper and I took 10 home. It was brutally cold if you have to take off your gloves to unhook the dinks. Im Looking forward to my perch fry though
661571,Rizzo,2012-01-29 00:56:00,4754, too many perch with bloated swim bladders plugging up the hole!
