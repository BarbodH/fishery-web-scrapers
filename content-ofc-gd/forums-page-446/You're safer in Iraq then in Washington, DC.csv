661658,Billy Bob,2012-01-29 13:40:00,5865,"Gun controlling The Australian Shooter Magazine last week posted this letter on guns, gun control, and killings:  “If you consider that there has been an average of 160,000 troops in the Iraq Theater of operations during the past 22 months, and a total of 2112 deaths, that gives a firearm death rate of 60 per 100,000 soldiers. The firearm death rate in Washington, D. C. is 80.6 per 100,000 for the same period. That means you are about 25 percent more likely to be shot and killed in the U. S. capital, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the U. S., than you are in Iraq.”  http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/other/outdoors/article717298.ece  Now play nice....."

661698,Billy Bob,2012-01-29 15:41:00,5865, I don't even have any pot....do you have some pot.....  As far as handling our guns....go ask Bin Laden......  But the thread was to show that the most GUN regulated city in the USA has the most crime and gun fatalities....go figure.
661700,BillM,2012-01-29 15:45:00,17367,I wonder how many of those gun deaths are gang/drug related..
