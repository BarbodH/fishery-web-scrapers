661423,Rustic-Fisher,2012-01-28 17:18:00,826,"You may be right. Gives me an excuse  to start targeting brookies, spake, and bows on some of those haliburton back lakes I've wondered about. Let's hope what little deep water ice we have stays."

661446,BillM,2012-01-28 17:58:00,17367,"It's only 6 weeks Wayne    If they were kept open, I'm sure the number of fatalities would climb through the roof!  We give people way too much credit"
