To the point that I have now been off of work since last year this time, surgeries, pain management clinic and now the latest high shock treatment and even level 4 laser.  Any way I have a chance to get away for 2 weeks to New Orleans and I under stand that Lake Pontchartrain is just a few minutes away from where I will be staying any and all suggestions on what to bring so that I can do a bit of shore fishing.  Please, all suggestions are welcomed and appreciated as I am leaving on January 26, day after tomorrow. This happened this afternoon,  Thank you all,  FLEX"

660122,Gregoire,2012-01-25 12:33:00,1397,A quick google search revealed that it a brackish lake. Looks like you will be dealing with trout snook and maybe redfish. Knowing nothing else about this lake I would bring medium to medium heavy spinning rods and buy some bait.
660189,Billy Bob,2012-01-25 16:03:00,5865,I hardly doubt you will get much help here from the Great White North...best I can recommend is Google the lake and start looking for a fishing forum local to where you will be fishing....  BTW are you going to be there for Mardi Gras.....if so take LOTS of pictures of those girls down there trying to get the beads....
660230,Mike Pike,2012-01-25 17:43:00,1332,"Oh, and just make sure they're girls."
660233,Billy Bob,2012-01-25 17:46:00,5865, When they lift their tops you'll know if they are girls or not....
660348,Pigeontroller,2012-01-25 23:18:00,2793,"ALLIGATOR GAR!!!  Do what Billy Bob suggested, google and find some local info..."
660607,jimmer,2012-01-26 15:28:00,2730,Saw some these when I was there.
