I then spend a week bent over kicking my self in the butt. I'm such an idiot...or is it my quest to just remain poor?  My wife's uncle held patents on quite a few things ranging from misile guidence systems to touch keypads like on your microwave oven and the little hologram on our paper money. Yes he died wealthy but to no advantage to anyone other than his offspring, and that's only right. He also worked on the Avro Arrow. He was a pretty fart smeller."

I have always thought that there should be some way to alert drivers that an emergency vehicle with sirens was within a 500 yard radius. In this day and age of loud music, earbuds for cell phone and rolled up windows for air conditioning, it is hard to hear the siren until the vehicle is almost on top of you. A simple warning light, heads up display or drop down flag would be all that is needed. It could be wired and triggered to the alert by the emergency vehicles strobe which changes traffic lights to red. Of course all the auto manufacturers would have to be on board with this. Is something like that feasible? I don't know."

The harder you push the brake pedel, the brighter your rear brake lights get.  If you lock up your brakes (or activate ABS) the brake like strobe.  Or if you're just riding your brakes lightly, the brake light is still on, but dim.  That way if someone if just riding their brakes infront of you, you don't have to slam on your breaks.."

The LED lights had two rings, the outer ring would light up under harder pressure.  Don't remember where I read it or if it ever went into production.  edit: yeah they use adaptive brake lights on some models that light up additional leds when braking hard."

I usually have the staff stuck in the ground near me while fishing so that I can put the rod in the holder while I unbutton the fish.
