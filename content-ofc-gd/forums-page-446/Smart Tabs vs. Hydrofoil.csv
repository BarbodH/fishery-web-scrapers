661289,zeeter,2012-01-28 03:01:00,92,"I have a 167 Princecraft Pro Series with a 70hp.  It's a great boat and I've really enjoyed it.  I fish erie a lot for smallmouth and when there's a bit of a chop the bow starts to go up and down (porpoising). I've adjusted the trim and that hasn't seemed to solve the problem.  My speed is slowed down to under 10 mph.  I've been looking into different options to solve the problem, most notably installing a hydrofoil or smart tabs.  From my research it seems smart tabs would be the better choice as a hydrofoil can put unneeded stress on the motor.  I've heard that a hydrofoil can make steering at higher speeds more difficult, but my boat is a semi-V not a deep V.  Any suggestions on what I should go with?"

661293,zeeter,2012-01-28 03:08:00,92,It hits 37 mph with 70Hp and the max HP for my boat is 75.  90HP would be fun though !
661295,Sinker,2012-01-28 03:10:00,8692,"I would get the smart tabs over the hydrofoil myself, but I have never used either of them.  I think solopaddler had them on his boat and loved them.  S."
661298,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-28 03:12:00,10439,Definately go with the Smart Tabs to get rid of your porpoising issue.
661307,danbouck,2012-01-28 03:43:00,4380,Smart tabs - they are awesome!
661313,mercman,2012-01-28 04:08:00,7054,Wouldn't they interfere with a transom mounted transducer?  
661320,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-28 04:36:00,10439,  Depends on where the transducer is mounted. It mat need to be moved.
