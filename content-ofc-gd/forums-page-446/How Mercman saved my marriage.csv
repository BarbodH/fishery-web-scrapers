661007,pikehunter,2012-01-27 11:30:00,1659,    Well done !
661020,bushart,2012-01-27 12:31:00,2628,Merky!!...Merky!!...Merky!!  Mmmmmmeeeeeeeeerrrrrrccccciiiiii...!!  
661025,mercman,2012-01-27 12:53:00,7054,"Ok guys.....here's the secret. Customer service. Pure and simple. Most parts companies have a call center.When you call, some young person answers the phone and asks the model number, and what part you need.Most have never seen a part in thier lives, and have never sat and had conversations with repair techs.If you are looking for advise, they freeze and say ""Call a repair tech"" I started in the shipping recieving of a major parts company 30 years ago.Touching and catalogueing parts. I can picture in my mind where the part goes and what it does in relation to the other parts. I train my people the same way.Even my wife, who does my accounting, can take calls and do look ups and is respected by the technicians who i supply. I have a big pot of coffee in my showroom, and repair guys stop in numerous times during the day, and discuss thier calls with each other.I always take time to talk with all of them, and learn common fixs for things. Most times i dont even need a model number to find the part. I am training my young nephew to take over my bussiness eventually, and carry on with this style of customer service. Old school is always better, at least in my type of work. Thanks again guys. You will ALL get the same treatment when you need parts at my store   Paul"
661030,motion,2012-01-27 13:13:00,403,"Paul,  I was standing by a parts counter in Toronto waiting for a part when a guy came in off the street with what appeared to be a perfectly good (new) dryer belt cut (which he had bought from them the day before). He actually asked for a ""splicing kit"" to put it together. You see, he had to cut the belt because he didn't know how to put it around the drum of the dryer????   :rofl2:  Cheers."
661035,Billy Bob,2012-01-27 13:22:00,5865, Splicer kit....OK...let me go in the back and get one young fellow...  Here you go....  :rofl2:

661047,SlowPoke,2012-01-27 14:10:00,2984," I like dealing with someone that knows their field. Recently I was considering replacing the cushions in my truck's bunk that make up a bed (think fold down camper style table) with a mattress. I called a truck dealer in Brampton and asked for a mattress and the counter guy was stumped; he needed my vehicle serial number to look up the part. I told him it didn't have a mattress from factory (many of the same model do but mine had the 'work station option'). He said he couldn't help me, I'd have to find a serial number from a truck that was equipped with a mattress from factory. Paul; I betting if you had mattresses in your inventory, you wouldn't need much help from the computer to find them! Kudos to you for helping your community and ours. Brian"
661050,bigbuck,2012-01-27 14:19:00,2449,"Kudos to you Paul!! The next time I have to play appliance repair guy, I'll be contacting YOU!"

661088,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-27 16:45:00,336,"The ironic aspect of this thread is that Mercman probably has saved a few marriges in his time.  Its just that he does it without having applience parts involved.  If ya know what I mean.  Big fan of the work that you do behind the scenes, Paul."
661092,Billy Bob,2012-01-27 16:51:00,5865," Oh, God...PLEASE remove the part # of this from your inventory....LOL.."

661225,mercman,2012-01-28 00:37:00,7054,  Sorry Skeets .....that job has already been taken  
660853,motion,2012-01-27 00:11:00,403,"Well I want to thank Mercman (Paul) for his help this past week. I had my Maytag front loader stop spinning and was faced with the problem of sourcing a new motor and control. After a couple of emails and a quick call to Paul, we had it all figured out. I recieved my package today as promised and installed it with out issue (or extra parts!!) He even sent some of his ""famous""  screwdrivers to take up with me this weekend to our GTG.  For those of you that don't know, Paul owns his own appliance parts store in Montreal. It was a pleasure speaking to him and he was more than generous by offering the parts at his cost. What a guy!  Thanks to Paul, I am able to to get away this weekend to North Bay for our GTG on Lake Nippising. As they say, happy wife...............happy life. Oh, we have clean clothes again too!  Thanks a bunch Paul. You 'da man.  Cheers."

660910,mercman,2012-01-27 02:16:00,7054,"Just doing my job sir !! I enjoy helping people out when ever i can.Thats why i bought this bussiness.

Enjoy the G2G Tony ! Take lots of pics and i hope you all catch your limits  Paul"

660988,Big Cliff,2012-01-27 09:59:00,6899,"When our fridge decided to give us problems, we called The service guy who told us it was going to cost something in excess of $500.00 to fix it. Thermostat was gone and the cold water line going to the outlet on the door had started to leak.  Paul got me the parts at cost delivered to my door and in less than three hours I had the thing working like new again. (I could probably do it in half the time now).  Every once in a while someone special comes along, Paul sure is one of them!"
660996,Billy Bob,2012-01-27 10:40:00,5865,SUPER PAUL.......GREAT MAN OF STEEL....
