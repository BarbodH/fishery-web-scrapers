660971,BillM,2012-01-27 05:23:00,17367,Luckily there are lots of dolphins.
661040,johnnyb,2012-01-27 13:43:00,3413,That's like.... 0.04 dolphins per minute....doesn't sound so bad.....  
661053,bassman87,2012-01-27 14:28:00,586,did you know 0.00067 die every second at the cove  
661085,captpierre,2012-01-27 16:37:00,2521,Sad.  And they are full of mercury and other contaminants.  Why would you want to eat them?
661089,jedimaster,2012-01-27 16:46:00,3472,I think part of the point of the movie was that they were selling at as whale meat without people knowing it was dolphin meat hat was contaminated.

661150,capt bruce,2012-01-27 20:03:00,820," NOW now , Pigeon , you are on OFC  , we do not say , A CERTAIN NATIONALITY , but YES some people do like the taste of some things OTHERS do not , people are people tastes are to the Individual , we all have  rights some we want some others want .. if you dont break any laws ?????? You could just have said PEOPLE THAT AGREE WITH THIS ARE WORONG , not some nationality, unless you speak for  them , hard to speak for a whole NATIONALITY .."
661181,Pigeontroller,2012-01-27 22:08:00,2793,"ok, ""some"" people of a certain nationality..."
661206,jedimaster,2012-01-27 23:51:00,3472,"I think some people of a certain skin color would be surprised to see what nation's support this practice financially, pollitically and by importing these animals and by products... I would suggest watching the video. It goes far beyond what some would think on the surface may seem restricted to people that look a certain way.  "
661207,Live2fish85,2012-01-27 23:56:00,1633,I agree with Pigeon and don't think there was any sort of racism. What he said was correct for the most part it is something that is big in certain nationalities. He didnt say everyone of the nationality ate them.
661213,Pigeontroller,2012-01-28 00:13:00,2793,"I am not racist. I am also not afraid to speak the truth. Not all Germans were guilty for WWII atrocities, but many were...Does that make me a racist?"
661231,jedimaster,2012-01-28 00:42:00,3472,I wasn't saying you were nor did I mean it that way. Just as I am sure you didn't mean your comment to sound racist.  Its all good man.
