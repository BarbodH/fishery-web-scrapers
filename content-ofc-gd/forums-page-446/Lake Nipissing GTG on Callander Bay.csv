661867,OutdoorDan,2012-01-30 04:21:00,325," No ling - we didn't get much fishing done after the storm set in as it was really hectic trying to prevent everything from blowing away - a big thanks to Nick and Jason for helping and saving my clam from blowing away.  My cousin's shelter ended up blowing away.  It was anchored in well but all 4 ropes ripped off and left the anchors in the ice - that's how strong the wind was.  Luckily we found it the next morning (thank you Jason for helping me look!).  I was 100% sure my tent would go too even though I anchored it really well, I am still surprised it didn't blow away.  I was afraid to even try opening it - because I knew as soon as I opened a door it would kite up and be gone.  Kevin, thank you for providing accommodation, I am certain many more things would have been blown away if it wasn't for you.   It's my cousin's.  Setting it up yourself is hard but very easy with two people. It's easily roomy enough for two people to fish in, I think it's a fine shelter under at least close to normal circumstances.  I can't even really blame the manufacturer for the ropes ripping and it flying away either - those wind gusts were by far the strongest I have ever seen on the ice and I don't think any portable would stand up to them."

661557,Rod Caster,2012-01-29 00:21:00,5784,"I just got home. Last thing I did was drive NAW and Livinfishing from the shack to shore, to pick up some gear. By they opened the door, a full blizzard had set in! I drove them back to the shack as a courtesy move,.. Should be an interesting night for them and Lota Lota.  Full report tomorrow.. Right now I'm off to kick out some jams for the night."
661568,registerfly,2012-01-29 00:53:00,198,"too bad we couldn't get out to your area and meet everyone. We ended up I don't know where. Roughly 4km from our huts but was told we could see an island and beyond was Callender Bay  we did well with some nice jumbo perch, walleye, and two good size whitefish. Fished in about 49FOW. have to say the whitefish is very good."
661596,spud7378,2012-01-29 02:23:00,68,"awesome time had by all, very few fish but i think it was fun day on the ice anyway! when we left the boys were getting set up for the night, then the phone call came that lota lotas tent and belongings were spread over callander bay!!!!!!hope everyone is ok! thanks to blair and chad for putting together another great day!!!"
661600,Nipfisher,2012-01-29 02:36:00,2449,"Short report as I did not take many of the pictures. Rod Caster was the camera man.

Weather was great, fishing was good.  My buddy from London ( Brian) got skunked which is good for me.  I outfished him by 1 pike 19.5"".  if it wern't for Alex nailing 3 walleye in less than 30 minutes I wouldn't have gotten any excercise, running to see his fish!  Blair U R the best for organizing this event.  Thanx for sharing your shack to warm up in. A big thank U to the OFNers who supplied the hot dogs & burgers.  My ride to the LCBO with the ATV was awesome.  U can drive an ATV on the streets in Callandar.  In my town U get arrested! Randy from Sturgeon - I did blow the horn while cruising thru Sturgeon Falls.  Why didn't U wave?  Blair What did U do with my cheesies & pretzels?  I'm hungry now!  Tired, going to bed"
661609,duckdog,2012-01-29 03:16:00,162,"great time guys, we had a blast my son is still up talking about his big fish :-) had a blast"
661620,mercman,2012-01-29 03:44:00,7054,Looks like a great day was had by all Looking forward to more pics

661622,duckdog,2012-01-29 03:50:00,162,"  my son is still bragging about the screwdriver, thank you much mercman"
661624,motion,2012-01-29 03:55:00,403,"Well that was a fun ride back home! It took us over four hours of driving through hell to get home. White-outs, two conga lines and tons of blowing snow. Well at least we made it back in one piece. I'm dead tired, mainly from running back and forth to my son Alexander's hut to help him with his many fish.  We had a blast today fishing and meeting all the guys that showed up for the GTG. Special thanks to Blair for organizing the event and for meeting up with us yesterday to do some late afternoon perch fishing. Thanks to Chad as well for helping us though out the day.  Hope we can do this again next year!  Cheers."
661708,Rod Caster,2012-01-29 16:35:00,5784,Nick and Dan! Did you get blown out to Sturgeon Falls last night? How'd it go? Any Ling?
661710,duckdog,2012-01-29 16:43:00,162,"  I would not have wanted that drive, man I left Blairs shack and he volunteered to drive with us the make sure me and my son go back to the park, good job I had a gps, visibility was maybe 10feet, it came up instantly, we went in the shack to say thanks and then I had the shack door ripped out of my hand with my guess 50kms winds, glad to see you made it home ok :-)"
661712,misfish,2012-01-29 16:48:00,29133,Who owns that clam? I was looking at one today.   
661715,motion,2012-01-29 17:26:00,403,Thanks. Ya it was a wild storm alright. I had over 300km to travel and most of the first part of it we were crawling at 30-40km/hr. It seemed to come in waves but we were able to pick up some speed further south. Now a day of rest before I get back to the bump and grind.......
661719,Nipfisher,2012-01-29 17:34:00,2449,"Brian, that Clam hub is Lota Lota (Dan's)."
661721,misfish,2012-01-29 17:39:00,29133,Thanks
661724,NAW,2012-01-29 17:40:00,4022,"that clam is Lota Lota's cousin.  They found it on the shore this morning!  It went for a ride last night.  Thanks Blair for letting us use the hut.  Radio said the winds where 90kmh.  I believe it.  Nice big drift around your hut now.  The fishing wasn't really fast, but ended the weekend with 3 perch, 3 herring, 2 walleye, 1 pike, and 1 LING..    It wasn't the giant that I wanted, but it made it all worth while!  Managed to squeak by Alexander by one fish to take the ""most fish"" price.  Split the pot with Trouty, who got the biggest fish with a decent pike.  Here's your half of the price Trouty..  A pile of change adding up to $13, and a hand full of lures!   Tagged a walleye first thing in the morning while packing up..   Or if your prefer this pose   And Dinner for tonight, and lunch for tomorrow..   It was awesome to meet everyone!  Thanks again for the Jack last night Lota Lota.  And thanks for the company Jason!  The drive home was sketchy, but we made it"
661726,Nipfisher,2012-01-29 17:44:00,2449,Good haul Nick. That walleye you caught this morning is huge! At least in the 2nd picture  . Looks like Trouty gets his plastics back.
661760,wormdunker,2012-01-29 20:39:00,1711,"Mercman thanx for donating some prizes.  Motion, we (Brian & Brian) had similar driving to get to Sudbury, storm came out of no where.  To my knowledge not even forecasted, but north of Sudbury they had a severe blizzard with 15 CM of snow.  This AM was beautiful on Nepawassi Lake.  Let's do it again next season.  It was a blast."
661810,irishfield,2012-01-30 00:58:00,26272,Glad everyone had a great time!!! Maybe next year I'll get there..
661824,wormdunker,2012-01-30 01:32:00,1711,"Hoping U were gonna ""Drop in"".  Ice was perfect for a landing strip"

661835,irishfield,2012-01-30 01:58:00,26272," not that rough frozen slush crap... if I was sure it was frozen solid it would have been wheels down, not skis!  Maybe next year.... might work it in on a trip North to fish real waters! LOL"

I really don't like unexpected expected company....  I was really looking forward to tomorrow.   Randy "
661104,Rod Caster,2012-01-27 17:25:00,5784,"I just purchased 8 burgers and buns.  Also got a pound of butter ... Now who is bringing the salted minnows, they sound delicious!"

661154,Nipfisher,2012-01-27 20:22:00,2449,"I drove right to the hut this morning. I drove onto the ice and parked close to the dock.    I walked to the hut with my gear then walked back to the truck drilling holes ever 200-400 feet. Here are some pictures to show ice quality and depth. I found varying ticknesses between 12.5"" and 16.5"". I then drove the truck to the hut then back off with out issue. Slush is all hardened and should make for better fishing.  Video          The drive"
661156,NAW,2012-01-27 20:28:00,4022,"Do you have a gaff at the hut?  I lost mine last year.  Just picked up all the parts to make a new one, but not sure if I have the time to complete the task tonight.  I don't have a welder.."
661167,Nipfisher,2012-01-27 20:54:00,2449,  Yep. there is a gaff in the hut.
661183,livinisfishin,2012-01-27 22:11:00,661,"Nick, You are not going to catch anything anyways so don't worry about a gaff... "
661192,Rod Caster,2012-01-27 22:45:00,5784,  Only took me 3hrs to make

All of us shut-ins will really appreciate a report...please please take tons of pics and write a few reports. That'd be great!
661217,OutdoorDan,2012-01-28 00:24:00,325,I'm all packed and ready to go.  Going to try to make it for ~8:00 tomorrow but it depends on how the drive will be from Mississauga.  I'll be the guy in the grey Armada.  See you all tomorrow! 
661226,NAW,2012-01-28 00:37:00,4022, C&R??  The gaff is for the GIANT ling that I'm going to catch!  Lobster for dinner on Nippissing tomorrow night!
661281,registerfly,2012-01-28 02:45:00,198,"Hey guys we are here also in our hut.  SLOW tonight. Any tips? What are you guys using? We got the usual glow in the dark, minnows, jigs, rapala jigging raps, etc.  Need to get the skunk out.  I also drove out in my van and unloaded. thick ice everywhere, but chickened out and then parked back at the lot off Birchgrove"
661294,Nipfisher,2012-01-28 03:10:00,2449,  South Shore eh? My guess is you are not deep enough. Make sure you are 25-40 fow and you'll find everything.
661296,Nipfisher,2012-01-28 03:10:00,2449, If you feel like taking a mid-afternoon drive come see us.
661297,Nipfisher,2012-01-28 03:11:00,2449, Looks like something my 8 year old did.

661407,registerfly,2012-01-28 15:45:00,198, Thanks for the tip Nipfisher. Our hut is over 28fow. Our operator is going to take us out after lunch to another spot. I'll see if I can get him to drop by your place too.  cheers
661440,Rod Caster,2012-01-28 17:44:00,5784,Nick is holding a strong lead right now. A pike a four herring. Blair has biggest fish with a decent pike. One small perch for me... At least my lures will be nice and clean

660791,duckdog,2012-01-26 22:06:00,162,"best to park at the park just down the road, there is a parking lot just down the road towards North Bay with way more parking but if your walking it will be quite the walk, depending on what times I am there I can give a few rides"
660796,Muskieman,2012-01-26 22:12:00,2472,"What?  I can't get out with the truck? I have a lot of stuff to bring, pic-nic table, BBQ, gear... Are there 2 ices again?  Randy"

660802,Rod Caster,2012-01-26 22:24:00,5784,"Yup. From what I saw yesterday, the slush layer hasn't completely frozen yet. If it were -20 tonight, we'd be ok.  I found a brand new mepps deep diver for the derby box! A twoonie gets you in the derby and if you can add a new or gently used lure or anything small and fishing related, then you get a big ol' handshake along with derby rights."
660807,NAW,2012-01-26 22:35:00,4022,I cleaned up one of my customized williams ice jiggin spoons.  Caught me many a Simcoe whitefish.

660817,Rod Caster,2012-01-26 22:46:00,5784, Nice. Anybody would be happy with that lure...and it comes with history and luck!
660828,OutdoorDan,2012-01-26 23:09:00,325,"I'm going to pack to walk out, but hopefully it will be driveable by Saturday morning.  I have a lot of stuff but since there is no snow on the ice judging by the pictures, dragging it shouldn't be too hard."
660831,NAW,2012-01-26 23:11:00,4022," I plan on dragging a load out in the morning with fishing gear.  The a second load in the afternoon with sleeping / Dinner stuff.  If you need a hand dragging stuff, just grab me, I'll give you a hand."
660832,OutdoorDan,2012-01-26 23:11:00,325,"Hmm, after just reading the post by kickingfrog in the other thread, I think I'm better off playing it safe and just walking out."
660833,OutdoorDan,2012-01-26 23:13:00,325," Thanks, I should be OK but if anything I will let you know.  I do have my little cousin to drag stuff out for me just in case though"
660842,Nipfisher,2012-01-26 23:26:00,2449,"I will drive out towards the hut tomorrow and post a report. There is varying ice but from where I have drilled it is all 11"" -15"" of good ice. The probalem has been the slush. One option for us could be parking on the ice at the bottom of the launch. There are some deep ruts but all trucks would make it down. I will drill several holes tomorrow and take pictures.  It will be 100% drive at your own risk....I will provide the info and if you are comfortable then you choose to drive."
660850,motion,2012-01-26 23:58:00,403,"Blair, I picked up a bag of big hot dogs and 24 large hot dog buns from Costco for Saturday's lunch. I'll give you a call when we arrive in North Bay tomorrow afternoon. Hope you can get away for a bit to get in some late afternoon fishing.  Got a couple of new lures for the derby and some ""famous"" small screwdrivers from Mercman (Paul) that I was asked to bring as well.  Talk  to you tomorrow.  Tony"

660949,NAW,2012-01-27 03:31:00,4022," Nice and warm.  12"" of ice. I think I'll leave the floater suite home, and just bring the old plad jacket."

660047,livinisfishin,2012-01-25 01:46:00,661, Haha more room in it compared to my old tribute! Screw roof racks I think we are going to need a trailer!

Looking forward to Saturday.  I see there is lots of food & drinks being brought.  I'd like to donate as well.  What do U need?"
660116,wormdunker,2012-01-25 10:07:00,1711,"I just posted about making a decision on purchasing an ice finder.  Is anybody attending the GTG that has a humminbird Ice 55 or Showdown.  Would love it if someone would show me how to operate it.  I hate reading manuals!  Also, I will probably purchase it Thurs or Fri after work.  Therefore I won't have extra time to learn to operate it.  3 more sleeps  WOO HOO  Thanx"
660126,Nipfisher,2012-01-25 12:54:00,2449,  Just bring a couple bags of chips or snacks. Hut is over 13 feet of water. We will fish an area from 11 - 16 fow. Perch have been active using smaller presentations and small minnows. Hopefully the fish cooperate and keep us busy. Pike have been plentiful around my hut this year. We have caught at least 1 walleye almost every time we have been there. Most guys doing well are 25-30 feet of water for walleye but would have been too far to have people walk out for the gtg.
660129,Nipfisher,2012-01-25 12:58:00,2449,  I use a Lowrance HDS-5 with the PPP-1 accessory (portable power pack) for ice fishing and also use it on my boat all year. They are expensive units but can be used all year round. Also Terry will tell you they are AWESOME.
660132,Rod Caster,2012-01-25 13:18:00,5784,Don't forget to bring a twooney and a small gift (eg. Lure) for the derby! Biggest fish and most fish split the pot.
660155,NAW,2012-01-25 14:05:00,4022,"Is TJ coming with a box full of goodies again?  If he is, I would love to buy an OFC toque from him??"
660163,Nipfisher,2012-01-25 14:26:00,2449,  Unfortunately T.J. will not be able to attend this year. Maybe P.M. him about the toque Nick.
660374,Nipfisher,2012-01-26 00:25:00,2449,"Drove out a little ways today, just past the end of the dock and rounded the corner towards the hut. Lots of ice but still breaking through the top layer and into the slush. It has tightened up around the hut and will be good for Sat. BRING CLEATS!"
660387,Rod Caster,2012-01-26 01:03:00,5784,"Thanks for the update... things might freeze up nicely over the next two days, but I don't think I'll be driving to your shack this year. Heel-toe express for me  My Dad and I just returned from a 4wheeler trip towards deeper water. We may have broken through the top crust a couple times; overall the ice is  suitable for a 4wheeler, not a snowmobile or truck. We caught one keeper walleye and missed two. 42fow. We just randomly picked a spot since we didn't bring the GPS.  edited to add : top crust"
660442,Nipfisher,2012-01-26 02:54:00,2449,After returning to the parking lot I walked out and with no snow on the hard surface with no sleigh to pull it was a 3 minute walk.    
660445,wormdunker,2012-01-26 02:59:00,1711,"Hey Nip  Add 1 to your list.  My buddy from London is coming.  His name is Brian, I'm Brian also,& also we R both crane operators. I'll bring chips, pretzels, as suggested earlier"
660477,NAW,2012-01-26 03:48:00,4022,"mmmmmm.. Pretzels.....   I just spend 2 hours in the garage getting my gear packed for this weekend.  Anyone else PUMPED for the NIP G2G!  I have to thank Blair, and all the other North Bay'rs (Chad, Randy, Kevin, Joey...) for the hospitality!  This is officially an annual thing for me."
660483,Nipfisher,2012-01-26 03:50:00,2449,It will only get better Nick. Maybe we will do South Shore one year for better walleye.
660517,wormdunker,2012-01-26 10:15:00,1711,I'm picking up a set of chains tonight for my ATV.  Ice everywhere here in Sudbury
660639,Nipfisher,2012-01-26 16:21:00,2449,"  Brian, it is such a short drive to my hut you woint need them. Actually you don't NEED to trailer your quad here at all."
660755,Lip-ripper,2012-01-26 20:43:00,228,"Looks like I'm likely gonna be joining you guys for this. 25km/h winds, I may need to drag the shack along. One question though Nipfisher, Is there any place to park other than the few spots near the Chief? I've only parked over there once before and didn't notice any other areas to park."
659373,Nipfisher,2012-01-23 13:08:00,2449,3 pike and 2 perch while building a fort and wrestling with my boys yesterday. Was not about the fishing lol.
659415,Lip-ripper,2012-01-23 14:29:00,228,"Hey Nipfisher, What shape is the lake in? really slushy?"
659428,Nipfisher,2012-01-23 14:44:00,2449,  Around my hut is really good actually. There are some deep pockets of slush around Sunbeam Bungalows and the launch areas (from traffic). Yesterday was the best I have seen it. Today's plus temps and rain may make it a little slushy.  Last 2 days we have walked out the launch and accross the front of the dock / island where it is packed from sleds and 4-wheelers. Makes for a minute or 2 longer walk but lots easier.
659633,motion,2012-01-23 23:56:00,403," Hey Blair, we are confirmed for the GTG! Please add my son (and fellow OFNer) fishman2202 to your list. He may be young, but he'll most likely kick some butt if he gets on to fish.  Let me know what we can bring for the GTG. (PM sent) Looking forward to seeing all the gang on Saturday.  Cheers!"
659695,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 03:16:00,2449,"Alright. Lets keep this on the 1st page. It is less then a week away!  Here is the confirmed list thus far........

If you are still ""trying"" to come....keep trying.   I know spud has his dad and some buddies coming. I have invited a few guys too. Looks like we will have about 20 anglers with at least 15 members.  Let's get the food figured out. Burgers and hot dogs are easiest. I'll provide all the condiments, and a case of water. We need people to commit to bring chips, buns, weiners, and burgers.  Ideas?????"
659699,irishfield,2012-01-24 03:23:00,26272,If the 40K wind is correct.. you wont see me fella!
659702,NAW,2012-01-24 03:41:00,4022,I've got a box of 8 burgers and a bag of 8 buns.  I can bring those.
659704,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 03:57:00,2449,  SW 20 km/h is what I have seen. I'll cross my fingers.   I'll let you use my HDS-5 Wayne.
659705,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 03:59:00,2449,  Great Nick. Maybe there will be enough left-overs for breakfast.
659707,irishfield,2012-01-24 04:09:00,26272," Current is 20 SW there.. 40 SW here.. and a lot of ""bumps"" in between. Who knows what it will really be in 6 days!"
659714,OutdoorDan,2012-01-24 05:15:00,325,"Hey Nipfisher,  I'm brining my cousin along as well.  Please let me know how I can help out with anything else.  I don't have a portable BBQ but would be glad to help out with food etc."
659749,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 12:59:00,2449, How about bringing a couple bags of chips or dorritos?
659753,East Luther,2012-01-24 13:16:00,9,"Hey, Blair!  Finally got on to the forum, add my name. I will only be stopping in for a quick visit.  Cheers,  Jay"
659754,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 13:17:00,2449,  WELCOME Jay.
659761,Rod Caster,2012-01-24 13:37:00,5784,"Woo hoo! 4 more days.  I'll be at the landing at 8am to meet the early-birds, black mazda truck with an OFC sticker on it. Blair will arrive some time around 9."
659764,motion,2012-01-24 13:53:00,403,My son (fishman2202) and I will be at the landing on Saturday morning to meet up with you at 8:00 AM. We will be in the black Ranger looking lost.........  Cant wait to see all of you Saturday!
659897,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 19:28:00,2449,Wel after the + temps. and rain here is what Callander Bay looked like today. It was slushy today but according to the forecast it will tighten up for the gtg. I think we will need ice cleats.      You can see my white hut (brown door) in front of the island.    
659898,duckdog,2012-01-24 19:39:00,162,"still easy going on the atv, must have missed you out there, we (me and the little guy) went for a quick ride to check it out"
659902,East Luther,2012-01-24 19:53:00,9,"Doesn't look too bad! With the -15 tonight and the low of -9 on Wednesday, it should tighten up a bit!  Will be up with the wife Thursday at 12:00 and the rest of the gang (2 other couples) show up Thursday evening, and fish until Monday morning! Can't wait!!!!  Cheers,  EL"
659911,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 20:26:00,2449,     It was a bit soft today but it will be better for Sat. Might be slippery though.
659929,motion,2012-01-24 20:59:00,403,Cleats........check.  I'll just keep adding to the list. Let me know if you want us to bring anything special. I was thinking to grab some hot dogs and buns for the BBQ.
659958,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 22:04:00,2449,  Sounds good Tony.
659959,Rod Caster,2012-01-24 22:06:00,5784,Do you have a frying pan in the shack blair? I could bring a stick of butter
659964,Nipfisher,2012-01-24 22:13:00,2449,There is only a small cast iron frying pan in the hut.
659975,OutdoorDan,2012-01-24 22:28:00,325, I have a pretty big solid one and can bring it if needed.
658007,wormdunker,2012-01-19 11:18:00,1711,"Good work Nip for organizing this event.  What time do U plan to be there?  I'm going to be there unless work gets in the way.  I'll check your posts for final plans.  Pls post whether U will have minnows.  This would help me out, save looking for a bait shop.  No problem kicking in $$$."
658009,Nipfisher,2012-01-19 11:27:00,2449,"  My guess is some people will arrive between 7:30 and 9. We ""kicked off"" at 9 am last year. Last year I was able to purchase bulk shiners in pounds I have requested again so I will find out. I am sure the locals can adrerss the bait need if my supplier doesn't come through."
658028,NAW,2012-01-19 13:04:00,4022,"Are we doing a little derby like we did last year?  If I remember correctly it was a $10 buy in (maybe $5?).  Biggest Fish, and Most fish split the pot, and get first dibs at the OFC gear box that TJ dropped off  That was fun last year"
658053,Rod Caster,2012-01-19 14:06:00,5784,I'll gladly pitch in a lure or two for such a derby
658241,Joeytier,2012-01-19 22:21:00,3990,Don't expect a repeat!  I may not be hungover this time.  Watch out!
658254,OutdoorDan,2012-01-19 23:02:00,325," I think you might be missing the point of a GTG, sir."
658273,Joeytier,2012-01-20 00:01:00,3990,"No I'm not, don't worry."
658276,Nipfisher,2012-01-20 00:06:00,2449,"  Nick, I think this is what we did......from last years thread.......   We also need to set some derby rules.   "
658289,Rod Caster,2012-01-20 00:35:00,5784,How about a twoonie and a lure?   I'm gonna jig me up a 10lbs ling this year... watch out boys!
658296,irishfield,2012-01-20 00:48:00,26272,"Prize for the shortest ""spot"" landing !!"
658352,Nipfisher,2012-01-20 02:45:00,2449,  I'll make sure to have some cold pop for you Wayne. I may have a beer or five but I'm not flying home.   Not driving either lol.
658354,Nipfisher,2012-01-20 02:46:00,2449,"  R.C., I'll leave the derby up to you. One less thing for me to arrange."
658359,Rod Caster,2012-01-20 03:24:00,5784,"In that case, let's do a ""deuce and a lure"" for the derby prizes. I'll bring a box and a few things to ante up the prize pool. Blairs suggestion works for me; most fish and biggest fish split the pot. If your attending, try to bring something like a jigging spoon, jig heads, hooks etc to pitch into the prize pool but no hard feelings if you happen to forget. Old minnows don't count as a prize. Haha. ..And the derby organizer CAN participate! I'm predicting a pre-hooked 10lbs ling on my third line takes all..."
658374,NAW,2012-01-20 03:53:00,4022,"Not to sound cheap, but can I throw in a new lure, that's out of the box, or should we have all new in the box lures?  I have some nice customize ice jiggin spoons I can throw in."
658413,Rod Caster,2012-01-20 12:00:00,5784,"I was thinking that too... Old lure, unused lure, opened box..as long as its not a rusty, hookless chunk of lead (unless a sinker), the prize pool will accept it!"
658455,Nipfisher,2012-01-20 14:29:00,2449,On my way to the hut right now.    I have just confirmed that I will recieve a pound and a half of shiners on the 28th at 8am. It will work out to about 11-12 dozen minnows. I will collect at the hut. No need to bring your own as I have more at my hut too.    Thank you to Discount Bait and Tackle for the great deal on the shiners. I will have a second person with me so I can transport them legally.
658669,Nipfisher,2012-01-21 04:08:00,2449,Should have a good report come Sunday. Gonna spend Sat night out there.
658778,Rod Caster,2012-01-21 16:17:00,5784, Nice! Lingfest! Will u be there during prime time tonight? I might want to come for a visit
658898,skeeter,2012-01-21 23:11:00,1907,Sounds like a good time. I will see if I can make it up there this year.
658932,Nipfisher,2012-01-22 00:40:00,2449, That would be awesome Dann.
659298,Nipfisher,2012-01-23 02:36:00,2449,"Alright. Lets keep this on the 1st page. It is less then a week away! Here is the confirmed list thus far........

657301,spud7378,2012-01-17 03:45:00,68,"i remember you from last year, we talked im the fire fighter"
657306,Nipfisher,2012-01-17 04:14:00,2449,"Spent 4 hours in the hut today but left before the evening bite. Managed 2 walleye, 3 pike, and 2 perch. I lost 3 fish and by the fight I am guessing one was a monster walleye that hit a 3"" sucker minnow. I also lost what I'm guessing is a heavy pike as I hit the ice at the bottom of the hole and knocked it free.    Good to see the pike and perch cooperating during the day with the odd walleye mixed in. Biggest pike I got today was 28"" and the little walleye I kept was about 12.5"". Also kept one 10"" perch.      When we get our holes drilled and it looks like swiss cheese we should have a productive day. I talked to a bait shop today about getting a pound and a half or 2 pounds of shiners. They will let me know later this week."
657349,NAW,2012-01-17 13:14:00,4022," No need to thank me.  Just finding another way to enjoy the outdoors, and helping out the comunity.   That's what I thought.  You going this year?   Thanks for the update Blair.  I have some suckers that are dead and salted.  Should I bring those up?"
657353,lew,2012-01-17 13:43:00,12766, Just saw the video Nick and that's some great stuff you guys do.  Goodonya for giving up your spare time to help others.
657381,Nipfisher,2012-01-17 15:05:00,2449, Spo far only live minnows have produced for me but a dead salted sucker close to bottom could get you a big ling over night.
657646,fish_fishburn,2012-01-18 03:58:00,1311,"I would take a run up there but I'm heading to Whistler the day before for a little apre. Maybe next year, sounds like it's going to be a good time."

657911,Locnar,2012-01-18 23:47:00,645,Sounds very interesting indeed. And I am mulling it over in the ol' thinking compartment. Is there any nearby cheap motels to crash the night in? Or am I to curl up in a fetal position and hope the night passes by quickly?
657916,Rod Caster,2012-01-19 00:08:00,5784," Nipfisher posted this a few pages back:   Here is some Hotel/Motel info. for those staying over night and needing accomodations.   The closest hotel is Terrace Suites but that is alot of cash. Next closest is Pinewood Park (Clarion Resort) but it is expensive too.   The closest cheaper hotel is the ""Adult Entertainment"" Moe-ze-on Inn (705) 494-4915.  My suggestion is one of these three places.  Arizona Motel 705-472-0800 1078 Lakeshore Drive North Bay, ON http://www.arizonamotelnorthbay.com/  The Lincoln Motel 705-472-3231 594 Lakeshore Drive North Bay, ON. http://www.lincolnmotel.net/  Glen Garry Motel 705-472-1085 785 Lakeshore Dr, North Bay ON,   All are less than 10 minutes from where we will be fishing and are affordable and comfortable.

656599,NAW,2012-01-14 21:32:00,4022, I'm glad there will be a few others out there for the night.  What kind of tent are you using?  I've always wanted to try tenting it on the ice.  I'm looking forward to seeing your set up.
656601,OutdoorDan,2012-01-14 21:49:00,325,"It's just a regular tent but it is a little lower and has a full canopy that goes all the way to the ground.  A full top+low is really the most important thing, beyond that, a warm sleeping bag.  My uncle actually owns a tent that is even better accustomed to winter camping, it's so low it would be difficult to even sit up properly for a big guy.  We'll decide later with my cousin which one to use.  The most important thing is the mats you use -- I have special thick ones.  Mat thickness isn't really something you want to mess around with as if it's too thin you can actually freeze some of your vitals.  Even with the thick mats I've seen that the snow under the tent melt a bit from where I was sleeping.  Anyway, I'd be glad to show you my set-up when I'm there."
656676,Nipfisher,2012-01-15 02:30:00,2449,"Rod Caster, I don't waste my time catching those minnows. Both keepers were 13""."
656682,Nipfisher,2012-01-15 02:54:00,2449,"Here is some Hotel/Motel info. for those staying over night and needing accomodations.   The closest hotel is Terrace Suites but that is alot of cash. Next closest is Pinewood Park (Clarion Resort) but it is expensive too.   The closest cheaper hotel is the ""Adult Entertainment"" Moe-ze-on Inn (705) 494-4915.  My suggestion is one of these three places.  Arizona Motel 705-472-0800 1078 Lakeshore Drive North Bay, ON http://www.arizonamotelnorthbay.com/  The Lincoln Motel 705-472-3231 594 Lakeshore Drive North Bay, ON. http://www.lincolnmotel.net/  Glen Garry Motel 705-472-1085 785 Lakeshore Dr, North Bay ON,   All are less than 10 minutes from where we will be fishing and are affordable and comfortable.   I can arrange to get minnows if that makes it easier.   More info to follow."
656686,irishfield,2012-01-15 03:01:00,26272,"GPS coords of the location, just in case it's a nice sunny day and I can ""drop"" in."
656691,Nipfisher,2012-01-15 03:17:00,2449,"  46.1307.44""N 79.2206.40""W"
656700,Nipfisher,2012-01-15 03:34:00,2449,  Here is what the launch looks like at the end of Lansdowne Street in Callander. My hut is less then 5 minutes walk from the dock. Parking on the right towards the Cheif Commanda.
656704,irishfield,2012-01-15 03:38:00,26272,  Okay... it might get a little exciting if I line up and try to land on that street!!
656710,Nipfisher,2012-01-15 03:53:00,2449,"  On a serious note, not sure if or how slush would affect your landing????"
656713,irishfield,2012-01-15 03:59:00,26272,"Wet snow not an issue.. if it has numerous inches of water under it, could be another story.. but there'll be lots of guys there to dig/pack and push! LOL"
656717,Nipfisher,2012-01-15 04:05:00,2449,  Lots of good snowy areas. Just a few isolated pockets of slush.
656721,irishfield,2012-01-15 04:11:00,26272,Not a problem.. as long as I have a clear area to land.. circle around and park back in my tracks I'll be fine. We'll have to see what the weather does and go from there. 2hr-45 by truck... 1hr-10 by air.. hmmm.
656726,Nipfisher,2012-01-15 04:18:00,2449,"  Over an hour seems long for such a short distance ""as the crow flies""? How long is the flight to your cottage on Temag?"
656728,irishfield,2012-01-15 04:24:00,26272,About an hour and 45 minutes.
656769,Rod Caster,2012-01-15 13:04:00,5784,"You no longer have to worry about a lighthouse being in your way. By the way, there will be some cute girls with flares waving you in. See you there!"
656770,NAW,2012-01-15 13:04:00,4022,I hope you can make it Wayne!
654152,Joeytier,2012-01-06 23:22:00,3990,Excellent.  Seems like this year will be a bigger turnout.  Gonna do some pre-fishing next weekend.
654515,Nipfisher,2012-01-08 04:20:00,2449,After a short delay my hut will be on the ice tomorrow. I obtained some rigid plastic sheeting last week and decided I should renovate my hut for added warmth and comfort.  Here are some of the interior pics from last year with unfinished walls.       Here are some new pics from today that show the improovements. I recycled some fibreglass insulation and put in some vapour barrier. Then covered it with the plastic sheeting. My boys were the 1st to decorate the walls and rule is if you sign your name you have to draw a fish. Look at my 2.5 year olds fish above his name.      
654532,wormdunker,2012-01-08 06:55:00,1711,I'm in Sudbury (see my post above) would love to join u guys.  I won't be able to confirm till we get closer to the date.  Just picked up my new ATV I'm ready!!
654543,wormdunker,2012-01-08 09:35:00,1711,Rodcaster   I would say Callander Bay is the South east part of the lake or am I wrong.  I was there many years ago.  If I remember correctly there is a park with lots of parking available in Callander to access the lake.  Some directions would be appreciated.  Thanx Wormdunker
654606,d_paluch,2012-01-08 17:00:00,343,"will try to make it out with my girlfriend.  We need to learn how to icefish, last year was uneventful to say the least. Hopefully see you guys there. You think a Mazda3 could make it out to where this spot is? I had 'er on Simcoe last year with no problem, but if there's too much snow she might not make it haha  edit* ofcourse if the ice isn't thick enough we can always walk!"
654607,Rod Caster,2012-01-08 17:09:00,5784," Callander Bay is the far east bay on Nipissing. Take highway 94 into Callander, turn on Main Street and the Government dock is off of Landsdowne. I'm 90% sure that is where Blair is putting his shack. He'll confirm that later on.   If there isn't much snow, your car will make it. If not I'll give you a ride with my truck"
654620,NAW,2012-01-08 18:46:00,4022,"Hey d-pulch, I walked last year, and it was only 15 minutes. Depending on where the hut is, it makes for a nice walk.  Last year there was lots of snow.  Some guys in a Civic buried it real good.  As as for learning some Ice fishing tricks, there's no shortage of experience up there.  You'll come away with lots of new knowledge."
654652,wormdunker,2012-01-08 20:32:00,1711,I'll be ready.  Painting my hut today.  I'll be on the ice in Sudbury this coming week end if I don't have to work.  Sounds like a good time.  How's the MNR & OPP in that area I don't mind giving someone a ride on my ATV.  Simcoe is not good for carrying a passenger.  Too many MNR/OPP!
654784,Nipfisher,2012-01-09 04:15:00,2449,"HUT is on the ice! A little further then last year but not as deep. Sitting above 12 fow. Didn't do very well today (1 walleye, 1 perch, 1 pike in 2.5 hrs) but not too concerned. I will move the hut before the 28th if things don't pick up.  d-paluch - as of today you could drive your car out but we'll have to watch the slush. The ice will be no problem with vehicles right to the hut. wormdunker - I will take some reference pictures and get directions for you all in the next couple days. I will also start a list of members attending.  Nipfisher Rod Caster Joeytier Randy From Sturgeon NAW Livinforfishn Spud7378 Lota Lota BassAsin  add your name in this thread if you plan on attending. Confirmation is not required."
654796,wormdunker,2012-01-09 09:46:00,1711,Thanx Nip I'll keep an eye on this thread.  How's your hut renovation coming?  It looks awesome. I just have to do some finishing touches on my hut this week & get my gear mounted on the bike.  How much ice at Callandar?
654815,Nipfisher,2012-01-09 12:56:00,2449," 13+"" of good ice. I'll be driving my truck now."
654818,NAW,2012-01-09 13:07:00,4022," Blair,  Would it be possible for you to give a cumpas bearing from the boat launch where we parked last year, to your hut.  With a rough distance.  If I'm walking out from the parking lot, that would be the easiest way for me to find the place."
654823,Nipfisher,2012-01-09 13:21:00,2449,"  It is actually easier to find then last year.   When you walk out of the launch and get to the end of the dock, turn left (Heading South East). There is an island there with a big white platform on it. There used to be a light house on it but it blew down in a wind storm several years ago.  When you get to the island you are looking right at the door of my hut.  Here is an old picture of the lighthouse. My hut is almost exactly where the hut is in the picture.  Callander Bay Lighthouse  My guess is it would be less then 10 minutes to walk. Only a minute in the truck  ."
655153,Nipfisher,2012-01-10 04:02:00,2449,If you don't attend how will you catch walleye like this? Rod Caster with a Callander Bay beast.     Here is the trick photography........  
655155,Nipfisher,2012-01-10 04:03:00,2449,The walk from the landing is only 5 minutes.It is actually quicker to walk behind the Lighthouse island and come out on the other side.          
655164,BassAsin,2012-01-10 04:22:00,806,"my south shore monster was'nt quite that big but darn close had to have been at least 100.....mm    sign me up for the gtg Blair, as long as work isnt calling i should be in."
655300,Nipfisher,2012-01-10 17:47:00,2449,forecast  18 days to the gtg and a great looking forecast for the next 2 weeks.
655303,Rod Caster,2012-01-10 18:05:00,5784, Hopefully that will freeze the moat around your shack!  Heavy snow forecasted for this thursday
655319,Nipfisher,2012-01-10 18:58:00,2449, I am going to move it on Thurs. About 20' farther back. Looking for 16' under the hut. That will give us 12-18 fow to fish around the hut.
655344,duckdog,2012-01-10 20:01:00,162,"I am off that weekend just have to make sure I can get a sitter, count me in, I may have 1 place in my yukon if my oldest does not come with me"
655386,Nipfisher,2012-01-10 22:13:00,2449,"I have updated the ""confirmed"" list on the o.p."
655401,d_paluch,2012-01-10 23:01:00,343,The girlfriend is out...  but my brother may be in! Crossing my fingers hes down...its just such a long drive from Oakville... lol
655412,livinisfishin,2012-01-10 23:34:00,661,Whos this livinforfishn character?
655416,Nipfisher,2012-01-10 23:37:00,2449,"  Oh he is a real   . Oops, I was up too late last night. Corrected now."
655419,Nipfisher,2012-01-10 23:39:00,2449,Drove my truck to my hut this afternoon. Plenty of ice now.
650310,Nipfisher,2011-12-22 13:31:00,2449,"With the ice finally forming on Lake Nipissing it is time to start organizing the 2nd annual OFC Lake Nipissing GTG. Last year we had about 15 members attend.  I am suggesting that we hold it the last weekend in January with the Saturday being the 28th. We will once again use my hut as the home base and fish around it.  I am willing to do all the organizing along with some assistance from my trusty sidekick Rod Caster.  We will arrange for the bar-b-que (Randy from Sturgeon?) and fire up some hot dogs, and hamburgs. I will try to assist anyone with finding sleeping accomodations at local hotels if needed.  I am trying to initiate the process for this year so comments regarding date or your ability to attend are welcome. If you are a North Bayite and want to assist it would be greatly appreciated.

650314,Rod Caster,2011-12-22 14:08:00,5784,Holy herring and perch and Batman! Count me in.  I wonder if JoeyT will make it out this year? Or LadyWalleye...but I dont' think we've heard from her for some time.  Thanks for putting this up Blair
650840,Rod Caster,2011-12-24 23:56:00,5784,"Callandar bay has been locking up nicely the past few days, but we are getting some above freezing temps in the next week. Hopefully the snow stays off the lake so the first layer is uninterupted. Still lots of time for it to freeze by the 28th.    "
650847,Fisherman,2011-12-25 00:18:00,7201,"Where exactly do you set this up, (on the lake I'm sure) NB side, or more on the South Shore? Maybe a spot on a map?  Might be able to make it if work allows."
650865,Rod Caster,2011-12-25 02:24:00,5784,"Hey Fisherman, Blair is setting up his shack on Callander Bay, which is the north eastern bay on Nipissing, on the shore of the small town called Callander. There is easy access with a truck, trailer or snowmobile. I'm not sure exactly where his is placing his shack but once I do, I (or Blair) can send you a map or post it on this thread. Hope to see you there!!"
650875,Fisherman,2011-12-25 03:56:00,7201,"Okay, thanks, at least I have a rough idea. We have been out to Glen Echo a couple times and few of the others a little west of there.  I know where Wasi Falls is, ate frog legs once upon a time in a little restaurant in Callander. Thanks again."
650949,Joeytier,2011-12-25 19:33:00,3990,"The 28th sounds good!  I'll definitely be in attendance.  I'll likely be in the Bay Friday evening, so if you or Chad need any help setting things up give me a shout."
650954,OutdoorDan,2011-12-25 20:49:00,325,I'd love to come up.  Are we going to be able to drive onto the ice?
650956,Joeytier,2011-12-25 22:18:00,3990,"Good chance, but no guarantees."
650959,OutdoorDan,2011-12-25 22:31:00,325," Thanks, Joey.  I'd like to come up either way, but if we can drive onto the ice there is a good chance I will want to tough it out and stay on the ice overnight."
650960,irishfield,2011-12-25 22:34:00,26272, You do realize that you can't fish Nip until Jan 1st...
650962,OutdoorDan,2011-12-25 23:29:00,325,"Haha, irish, that's not what I meant!  Although the image of me creepily camping out on Nip for a month waiting for everyone to show up for the GTG is very entertaining!"
650963,Rod Caster,2011-12-25 23:35:00,5784, N.A.W. Stayed in Blair's shack at last years G2G...if you reserve early this year there might be a spot open.  Hope to see you there!
650967,OutdoorDan,2011-12-25 23:52:00,325, That would be great!  If it's not an option I can always bring my mighty tent.  I've slept overnight in a tent ice-fishing before so it shouldn't be an issue.
650969,Joeytier,2011-12-26 00:06:00,3990,"That's the spirit!  I won't be joining you, but I'd give you a hell of a high-five if you followed through with it."
650972,irishfield,2011-12-26 00:24:00,26272, Sorry.. saw the 28th.. missed the January part!
651064,Bernie,2011-12-26 21:00:00,3190,"I was just chatting with a fellow that lives on Fish Bay. There is still open water in places. Even after several cold nights. Dang, usually I am out there riding around checking things out by now."

652544,Joeytier,2012-01-02 03:29:00,3990,Bump!  Let's get a bigger turnout than last year.  Someone still has the big ol' banner right?
652558,NAW,2012-01-02 04:14:00,4022," I already called shot gun on one of the bunks!!  If I don't have SAR training, I'll be there with bells on (literally).  Hey Fisherman..  If your drivin by Orr lake, maybe you wanna car-pool?"
652822,Nipfisher,2012-01-03 03:43:00,2449,"O.k. folks,  Here it is. I'm going to have my hut in a similar spot as it was last year only a little shallower so we should have more perch action. Nick (NAW) is going to spend the night there and if another member want's to join him P.M. him to make arrangements. I can stay in it any time, so I'll give it up to members this year. It is warm and comfy for 2 people. No cost. I'll get shiners for us all when I know how many are coming. Should be no problems driving right to the hut. I'll get in touch with the locals to arrange food. Probably start at 10 am and hang around until it gets dark.  You are welcome to arrive and leave as you wish. If you can stop in for a 1/2 hour (T.J., Bernie) that would be great.   Any ideas or questions post them here or P.M. me."
652841,OutdoorDan,2012-01-03 06:11:00,325,"PMed Nick hopefully I will get a place .  If not, tent time!"
652951,NAW,2012-01-03 20:24:00,4022,"Thanks for the accomodations Blair!  Last summer, Livinisfishin expressed some interest in spending the night in the hut this year.  So I gave him first dibs at it.  He's in!  If something happans, and one of us can't make it, then Lota Lota's runner up.  Look forward to seeing everyone again.  I call the hole next to Randy"
652961,Nipfisher,2012-01-03 21:08:00,2449,  As long as it's not Randy's hole that you're calling alls good.
