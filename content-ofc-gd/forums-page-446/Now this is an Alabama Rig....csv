661458,Wolf 3,2012-01-28 18:51:00,134,Came across this picture.  Not sure if it is a hoax.   
661461,Roy,2012-01-28 18:55:00,13728,"Nope, not a hoax at all. That same dude swings 5 rods and only one reel feeds the 5. Strange stuff but strange is what you have to be if you're trying to accumulate likes."
661462,Wolf 3,2012-01-28 18:56:00,134,"Sorry,  "
661463,Roy,2012-01-28 18:57:00,13728, ???
661464,Wolf 3,2012-01-28 18:59:00,134, I didn't think you could see the image.
661466,HTHM,2012-01-28 19:02:00,4082,I can't Edit the post to HTML on.

661468,lew,2012-01-28 19:05:00,12766,I couldn't see the picture a few minutes ago but I can now.  Pretty crazy rig that dood is casting
661469,Wolf 3,2012-01-28 19:05:00,134,Thanks! Will use HTML going forward.
661479,Frank,2012-01-28 20:09:00,74,That is just ridiculous.
661481,BillM,2012-01-28 20:12:00,17367,"Great Photoshop, lol."
661512,SmokestackLightnin,2012-01-28 22:28:00,390,Has to be a hoax or that rod has the flexibility of an extra stiff driver shaft.
661522,ld17,2012-01-28 22:57:00,319,"I want to say fake, because I could do that on photoshop but looking at the baits alone they all look a bit different.  Now that would be a lot harder to do.  Good job if it's a fake."
661541,tomO,2012-01-28 23:33:00,363,I think there called umbrella rigs.
661544,John Bacon,2012-01-28 23:38:00,3277,"Looks like the boat is sitting his drive way. Maybe more staged than photo shopped.  With the hydro/telephone poles and lines in the back ground combined with the fact that pictures was taken from outside the boat at a low angle, I would say that the photographer was standing beside a trailered boat when he took the picture.  I think the he really does have a bunch of Alabama rigs on his line, but he's not really casting, and not really fishing; just posing with rod. No PhotoShop, just a staged picture taking in his driveway."
661555,Harrison,2012-01-29 00:16:00,2202,"I think that rod would of snapped if it was real.  I've thrown a 4 lure one, that was heavy enough."

661566,SmokestackLightnin,2012-01-29 00:48:00,390,"Hey Roy, wasn't the guy in the yellow shirt in Hangover and Hangover2? Yeah, it's Mr. Chow -- I think he's about to say ""We had a sick night......."" right at the end."
661581,walleye wanderer,2012-01-29 01:34:00,64,"I would say it's a nice photoshop but no matter, why not just through in the big net and drag the lake? NOT fishing..."
661593,John Bacon,2012-01-29 02:19:00,3277, Do you have the one of him trying to clear a birds nest out of that?
