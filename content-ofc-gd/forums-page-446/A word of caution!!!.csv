Well guess what.... you guessed it, in the 5 min it took this guy to walk to his truck and drive back to the landing someone scooped his hut and gear. Drives me nuts all the idiots out there."
661266,NAW,2012-01-28 02:06:00,4022,"That doesn't surprise me.  I feel sorry for the guy, but...  Simcoe is a popular place.  All types of people fish there.  Good and bad."

661270,kickingfrog,2012-01-28 02:20:00,8333, Unfortunately all someone saw was some guy puling/loading a sled on a truck. Thieves look just like the rest of us. They don't look like the evil villains in the cartoons.
661277,Skipper D,2012-01-28 02:37:00,1970,"  Yes but jess , every one around that spot can't be in cahouts . Just madning that all ."
661278,mercman,2012-01-28 02:37:00,7054,That sucks big time.I had my house broken into a few years ago. The ijut actually talked to my neigbors for a few minutes before he robbed meThey said they thought he was my friend cause he was so polite and at ease talking with them
661283,Skipper D,2012-01-28 02:47:00,1970,  did you ever get any thing back?
661287,4x4bassin,2012-01-28 02:57:00,1025,"That is the exact reason why I don't like to fish Simcoe ,even though it has a world class fishery I would rather drive the extra couple hours north and be away from it all. That is just BRUTAL"
661288,kickingfrog,2012-01-28 03:01:00,8333," No one is in ""cahouts"". The point is some guy loading his sled onto his truck looks the exact same as the thief loading a stolen sled onto his truck."
