660767,Beans,2012-01-26 21:13:00,3339,My wife just purchased a 2005 Ford Escape 4x4 but there was no owner's manual with it...I thought CTC carried them but it looks like they only have repair manuals...I can read a manual on-line in PDF form but it would be nice to have one handy in the glove dept...  Anybody know where I can purchase one to avoid printing 296 pages...
660768,fishingfarmer,2012-01-26 21:15:00,34,Try an auto wrecker.
660775,misfish,2012-01-26 21:28:00,29133,  Just what I was going to say.
660779,Billy Bob,2012-01-26 21:32:00,5865,NO need to purchase one.....I tell you the climax of the book....last page  says trade this in on a Toyota Tundra....that's what I did...  BTW I'm sure the bride will be happy with her new ride.....
660783,bigbuck,2012-01-26 21:49:00,2449,"Check with your local Ford dealer, they might be able to order one in for you OR at least steer you in the right direction, I know with GM, they give you the website for the printer and you get one directly from the printing company."
660784,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-26 21:49:00,130,"  YOU MAY STILL BE ABLE TO BUY ONE FROM THE DEALER, DON'T AMAGINE THAT THEY COST TOO MUCH BUT SERVICE MANUALS FROM FOR, YOU MAY NEED TO BUY A TOTALL OF THREE, HAVEN'T WORKED FOR FORD IN A LONG TIME SO NOT SURE IF YOU CAN EVEN BUY THEM IN PAPER."
660847,bow slayer,2012-01-26 23:52:00,1074,i went to buy one from the ford dealer for my 2008 explorer..... ...they want 80 bucks for one. Try ebay i got one for about 20 bucks with shipping. The wreckers were all picked clean.
660862,TennesseeGuy,2012-01-27 00:33:00,957,"Skim over the entire 296 pages, make some notes and then print only the pages you need, when you need them."
661108,Beans,2012-01-27 17:37:00,3339," I may end up doing just that as I have printed off the instrument panel, radio instructions and lights already...got a three hole punch, just need to pick up a binder...   Thanks for all replies guys...Will try the Ford dealer in Bobcaygeon...   "
661250,PERCHER,2012-01-28 01:27:00,787,For Ford try    HELM.COM
661256,PERCHER,2012-01-28 01:34:00,787,The owners manuals come from the us and with shipping $25.00. Or you can wait a week or so and I will get you one for free. Dan
661280,ketchenany,2012-01-28 02:43:00,3229,"   You ARE the man! Per cheer. A PDF print out is a good idea Beanzi, but only the pages you need. I don't understand why if you get it with the vehicle why not pass it on . . . I just sold my 95 Jeep and all service records for the last 12 years plus manual was include! I'd take Percher's  offer."
661284,Beans,2012-01-28 02:50:00,3339," Thanks Percher...I got all the time in the world to wait...that is, unless, the good Lord has other plans...   "
661286,ketchenany,2012-01-28 02:55:00,3229,"Sorry Percher, for the miss spell, I love my iPad but it has a mind its owen with spell check. Roy will correct me soon!"
661348,pikehunter,2012-01-28 11:38:00,1659,I also think the wrecking yard maybe the next cheapest to printing off the important stuff and don't bother printing off the junk like how to wash your car pages.  Or: from helms  I always wonder how owners manuals get lost? Doesn't everyone just leave them in the glove compartment?
