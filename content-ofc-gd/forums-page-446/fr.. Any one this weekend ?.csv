661259,Skipper D,2012-01-28 01:38:00,1970,Just wondering if any one will be out fishing this weekend from their boat ?
661261,mercman,2012-01-28 01:43:00,7054,Musky Mike said he is going out tomorrow in his boat. How about you Ron?
661267,Skipper D,2012-01-28 02:06:00,1970,"Well Paul i know i said earlyer in the week i wanted to bring my boat out of storage but i did'nt get the chance ,  we've had just enough snow to keep me busy and along with that the fixing of equipment , today was the worst with things breaking down . If we get a break in the weather i will consider it again , it surewould be nice to have some fresh fish for the table one night ."
661268,Skipper D,2012-01-28 02:10:00,1970,"The other thing besides the snow is , i've been busting my butt every chance reno'ing my shop so i can start building my fishing boat ,"
661275,mercman,2012-01-28 02:33:00,7054,never enough time in a day.You go easy on yourself there Ron.
661279,Skipper D,2012-01-28 02:43:00,1970,EASY .........whats that . You just do what needs to be done and with this brain i'll never be done ...lol
661321,Mike the Pike,2012-01-28 04:49:00,3421,Sometimes I get the urge as my boat is stored in a heated Garage.   I don't own a 4 wheel drive so thats another no no in winter.  Here is one everyone should be checking your insurance coverage.  My boat is covered from April to the end of November so guess I will just read the diehard reports.
661322,BillM,2012-01-28 04:54:00,17367,Nothing but ice for me this weekend!
661358,mike rousseau,2012-01-28 12:54:00,4661,Heading out for some walleyes today in the boat...  Pumped...  I got my brother coming as well as another local guide who's a good friend of mine...  If we catch... I'll make sure to get some pics...
661406,Skipper D,2012-01-28 15:37:00,1970,"  Glad to hear Mike ,  west for those , question......is there much ice at Hooples this year..."
661589,mike rousseau,2012-01-29 02:12:00,4661,  Hooples is a  bit thinner then most years... But still trucks out there... 12 + inches everywhere I punched holes last weekend
661595,Skipper D,2012-01-29 02:21:00,1970,"  Thanks Mike , i'll pass that on to one who was wondering............"
