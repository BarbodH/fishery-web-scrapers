Bite was very slow, but I had about an hour that they were on fire and I went 4/8.  No big ones, but got some decent quality.  Fish mixed on tubes and x-zone swammers. Kept a couple for the smoker, cant wait for that candy!!! As usual, any questions, ask away...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXmHRYXY47w"
