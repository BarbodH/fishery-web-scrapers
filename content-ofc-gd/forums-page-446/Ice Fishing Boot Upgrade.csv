660474,Homer Is King,2012-01-26 03:45:00,305,"I have tried several different types of cleats on my ice fishing boots. The all fell off, slide around, or didn't really work. So I grabbed a box of #8 - 1/4"" self tapping metal screws with hex heads. I then screwed a bunch of them into the soles of my boots.       I've had them out twice now and I'm very impressed! They grab the ice great. They don't feel funny under the boot. I'd recommend it!"
660479,Twocoda,2012-01-26 03:49:00,4130,are those stainless steel? or do you think they will wear out before they rust
660489,Homer Is King,2012-01-26 03:54:00,305,"I'm not sure on the longevity of this ""upgrade"". They are not stainless but appear to have some type of galvanizing on them. No signs of rust yet after 2 trips. I anticipate some wear but I think it will take a lot of wear before the ""grip"" is affected. Time will tell...."
660492,Twocoda,2012-01-26 03:58:00,4130,"its a good upgrade to say the least...i wish you wouldnt have posted it on the internet though....part of ""my"" fun of trout opener ....is watching people slip in the river...i bet a buddy last year there would be three we would see....i won!!!!"
660497,BillM,2012-01-26 04:04:00,17367,I use the exact same screws on my Simms G4 Guide boots..  A lot cheaper them the Simms studs!
660554,mike rousseau,2012-01-26 13:16:00,4661,Nice mod...  Too bad I don't have boots I only wear ice fishing...  Those studs would be rough on the boat...
660569,Harrison,2012-01-26 13:53:00,2202,Very Nice!  And... you have a great rebutal next time someone tells you to go S..... yourself.
660582,crappieperchhunter,2012-01-26 14:17:00,2582,I have been doing this for years. They will wear down before they rust off.I never have much of an issue with rust really. I get about 2-3 seasons out of mine before I have to change some of the more worn ones.
660594,cuzza,2012-01-26 15:08:00,467," Ah yes the $50 a box Simms studs - must be made of unobtainium or something , I use sheet metal screws on my wading boots too.  I also bought a set of HT cleats from Canadian Tire for ice fishing, only one use so far but I'm impressed, they grip well and didn't move all day, only issue was the velcro toe strap was too long - easy fixed with scissors.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Fishing/WadersFishingApparel/PRD~0780863P/HT+Enterprises+Super+Stud+Sandal+Cleats%2C+black.jsp?locale=en"
661105,SylvanOwner,2012-01-27 17:25:00,266,"I've had these, http://www.leevalley.com/en/garden/page.aspx?p=40911&cat=2,51676,40911, for a number of years and find them to be excellent.  You can even get a a restuddig kit."
661112,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-27 17:48:00,2690,"Great tip, Chris.  Noticed the pic has 1/2"", but, you mentioned 1/4""?  Are the ones in the pic, the actual screws you used? Have an older pair of Kamiks that might just get this ""upgrade"""
661116,Homer Is King,2012-01-27 17:57:00,305,"Yep, that's a typo, the box (1/2"") is what I used."
661121,BillM,2012-01-27 18:10:00,17367,"Frankie, the 1/2in is what you want!"
661127,newb09,2012-01-27 18:23:00,49,Can we find the same size screws in aluminum?
661135,BillM,2012-01-27 19:16:00,17367,Why would you want aluminum?
661139,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-27 19:43:00,2690,"    Thanks, guys!"
661141,newb09,2012-01-27 19:51:00,49,I need theme on my wading Simms boots. I think they grip better in the river as the aluminum is softer then Stainless.
661153,BillM,2012-01-27 20:20:00,17367, Only thing they'll do is wear out faster.  I run the 1/2in sheet metal screws in my Simms G4 Guide boots and they work perfectly.
661164,newb09,2012-01-27 20:50:00,49, Good to know.. Thanks Bill!  Do sheet metal ones rust?
661168,BillM,2012-01-27 21:01:00,17367,I haven't had any rust issues at all.  I do flip my boots over after a day of fishing and let them dry in the garage..  Nothing special.
661223,pike slayer,2012-01-28 00:35:00,1177,"those studs probably work great. i have these boots http://www.overshoe.com/Pages/Product.aspx?category=STABILicers%C2%AE&cat=HLS-OVERSHOE&pid=N5P3S and they have almost the exact studs. these boots are awesome, i love them. you wear your running shoe in them, they are light feels like you are just wearing your shoes, 100percent waterproof and they are warm. great for driving to the lake through your boots on fish all day then go back to the truck and not have to change your boots. highly recommended!"
