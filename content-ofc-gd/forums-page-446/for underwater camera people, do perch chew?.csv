People have written that fish might not swallow immediately, wait for it to chew, swallow then set the hook.  When I use LIVE minnows, I hate the fish stealing my minnow, so I set the hook immediately.  When I use plastic minnows, I don't mind waiting. BUT, can perch tell? If it tastes like chewing gum, will they spit it out?  Jiggy"

They will generally suck in the hook and the small minnow so you can set when you get a tap.  If you use a bigger minnow they alot of times bite and only look like there smoking the minnow.  When this happens you miss half the hook ups and lose alot of bait.  Somtime they will only hit on live minnows but they some time will hit on a little chunk of worm, minimal rebaiting.   There is a bunch of excellent video on u tube type in underwater camera video perch."
