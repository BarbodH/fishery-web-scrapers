661590,Leecher,2012-01-29 02:15:00,7832,"Today, Paul and I had plan to target rainbows on the same lake I got my PB last Sunday  Here's the link for those that missed it:  My Previous Report  Weather wise, we couldn't ask for anything better... Temp when I got up was -4C, 93% humidity and no wind... PERFECT  But a mystery guest (with to young ones) made his way from South Western Ontario (more specifically Hamilton area) to join us and I couldn't wait to meet him  After many PM's between the two of us the last 3 - 4 weeks, he finally arrived Friday morning    On my way home from work, stopped by the motel he was staying and met him in person    Man was I ever glad to shake his hand and finally meet him face to face  It was funny, when we started talking, it was like I've known him for the longest time even though I only known him online from this board    We talked for a bit over an adult beverage and discussed the details of what Paul and I had planned  Saturday, 7h00am was the time planned to leave but some unforeseen delays had us leave around 7h30am or so    We got to destination in almost a record time and met 2 other guys (Dan & friend, can't remember his name sorry  )  Upon arriving, Paul got to business and punched 20 holes and we all got setup    We dropped our offerings down and got to work  Dead sticking  Salties & dew worms, jigging a variety of spoons tipped with a variety of Gulp products  Unfortunately, there was no bite in the first few hours so Paul decided to punch more holes to see if he could locate any fish... Paul got a few perch in deeper waters and so is Dan and his friend  Here's a shot of Paul jigging    OFC member Vinnimon with his youngest daughter    Vince's oldest daughter    Unfortunately for us, trout had lock jaw and got skunked today A snow storm had rolled in in the afternoon and we left around 2h00pm cutting our stay short    Wish we could of got into a few for Vince sake but wasn't meant to be  All in all was a great time on the ice!!! Until next time Tight lines Leechman  P.S. Vince, was awesome to finally shake your hand and meet you in person    Had a blast today sharing the ice with you even though trout had lock jaw... wish you a safe trip back home and thanks for a wonderful day"

661722,motion,2012-01-29 17:39:00,403,"Thanks as always for sharing Jacques. Nice to hear of another GTG with you and Vince. We had a blast in North Bay this weekend. Next stop, La Belle Province. Well, maybe some time soon.  Cheers. "
661732,Leecher,2012-01-29 18:22:00,7832," It sure was great Frankie!!!   Paul, if you ever get to meet and fish with Vince, you'll have a super time     I know... I certainly did  Also, if you ever come up in the valley and want to go fishing, gimme a holer, I'd be glad to share some fishing time with you as well   It was great for sure Chad!!!   Unfortunate Dan     but the fishing was great nonetheless   Tony, where abouts are you heading?"
661759,motion,2012-01-29 20:38:00,403,"No where right now Jacques. Just thinking of how nice it would be to someday hook-up with you for some ice fishing. Maybe my son Alexander could put on a ""clinic"" for us like he did in yesterday's GTG on Lake Nippising."

661817,Leecher,2012-01-30 01:15:00,7832, It'd be awesome Tony   If Alexander and yourself are up for some trout hunting... come on up... I'd be glad to meet you and take part of a fishing clinic   Your too kind Kev    The beauties were nowhere to be found unfortunately   Them's are the brakes I guess   but still was a great fishing trip
