I owned  a buoy o buoy 1 piece for 10 years, found it to be awkward, bulky & difficult to put on & off.  I needed to replace it so I decided to look at the floater suits as opposed to a ""survival"" suit.  I found a HJC 2 piece floater in Sudbury.  Tried it on & was pleasantly surprised how comfortable it is.  It's 2 piece which is great for jacket removal on a mild day, has cloth lined pockets in the bibs as well as the jacket, also a cloth lined collar, full lenght zippers on the bibs, lots of velcro.  Also storm flaps over the zippers on the bibs & jacket.  Price was $144. for the jacket, $117. for the bibs, total $216.00 which is alot less than all the survival suits I checked out.  If u wish to see pix of the suit see the post of the G2G on Nipissing this past week end ""the winners are"".  Overall very comfortable & easier mobility.  I'm of the older generation so comfort is important.  Also purchased a pair of ""Nats"" rubber boots.  This boot was recomended by another member in a previous post.  These boots are the lightest boot I've ever tried.  Warm, comfy, lightweight!  I have the Sorel snowmobile boot but the uppers being nylon would  allow water in while using a gas auger.  I used the Nats at Saturdays G2G (mild weather), very comfy, but also fished in Sudbury on Sunday where it was -9 with 15km wind.  They were also very warm.  I highly recomend these 2 products to any outdoors people.  Nats boots $89.00.  Hope this helps others narrow their choice for outdoor clothing."
