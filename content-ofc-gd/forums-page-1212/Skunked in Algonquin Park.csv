I traveled with a bunch of friends and fished from the shore along hwy 60 on Lake of Two Rivers, and later on tried several spots on Oxtongue River, while they were doing trails, but no luck. I was somewhat tied on my friends, because I didn't drive my car, so I had to stay within walkie-talkie reach, more or less. Got some nice pictures, though... Here are some, for you to enjoy    "

With a decent zoom lens, I would have posted the pair of loonies - can I call that a toonie?  - that surfaced about 20 meters from my fishing spot. I snapped a picture, but they rather look like a ripple on the water. However, I enjoyed their mating ballet; I hope that's not tagging me a perv  ..."
