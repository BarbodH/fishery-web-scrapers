74476,wil wegman,2007-05-23 22:44:00,17,"ANGLERS INVITED TO COMPETE IN ANNUAL PIKE TOURNAMENT THIS SUNDAY  For Only $100 per team    The Aurora Bassmasters would like to invite anglers with a  boat and working livewell to compete in their annual pike tournament  on Lake Simcoe  The annual event will take place Sunday May 27,  2007 out of Pasadena Marina in Keswick on the pike filled waters of  Cooks Bay. Entry fee, payable beginning at 6am the morning of the  event,  is only $100 per team and includes ""Big Fish"".  Heaviest three pike win the tournament.    As part of an ongoing MNR Community Fisheries and Wildlife Improvement  Project, several of the pike caught during this event will be chosen  for an adult pike transfer to nearby Fairy Lake and the upper reaches  of the Holland River in Newmarket.  Here, the pike will become the top  predator and will play an important role in balancing the small  aquatic ecosystem of this Urban Fishery. Wil Wegman Conservation  Director for the Ontario B.A.S.S. Federation Nation, explained that ""This  annual pike tournament and transfer is an excellent example of how our  Ministry of Natural Resources and tournament groups can work together  to benefit our fisheries.    Lake Simcoe currently has an incredibly productive northern pike fishery  that at one time included those upper reaches of the Holland River and  Fairy Lake where we release our annual 20-30 pike. With dams and  obstructions however in the river, the pike from the lake have a tough  time making it south to Newmarket without our help. The Aurora Bassmasters  and this annual pike tournament/transfer have clearly demonstrated to the MNR  one of the many ways tournaments can assist them in their work.""    The Aurora Bassmasters are proud members of the Ontario Bass  Federation Nation which is made up of about 30 B.A.S.S. chapter clubs.  The Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.) is the world's largest fishing  organization, with over 600,000 members and federation nations in 46 states  plus Japan, Zimbabwe, Mexico, South Africa, Italy and of course here in Ontario.
