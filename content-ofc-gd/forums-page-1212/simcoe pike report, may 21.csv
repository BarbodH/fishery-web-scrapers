73707,pikeie,2007-05-21 22:28:00,380,"well tinbanger and i were able to get out of the house nice and early today, we got up at 4:30am and were on our way shortly after. we got to the launch and the water was nice and calm, but it was just a tad cold lol, good thing for the floater suits lol. so we get to one of our ""secret"" spots and start to fish some shallow structure. fish that area for 20 min without a hit so we moved out deeper and fished some weedlines and weed flats. not long after tinbanger gets the first fish of the day not big but took the spoon very deep blod was everywhere so we had to keep it, the fish was around 24-26 inches.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179784953  so i start to thorw around a red and white williams wabler and it gets smashed i set the hook and the fish starts coming in easy thought it was just a hammer handle but once it got within 10 feet from the boat it took off and wouldnt stop lol. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179785231 so i got the fish turned around and started to gain some line on him and after some acrobatics the fish found its way into the net. i realised that the fish wasnt that long only 30.5 inches in length but it had a huge gut on it and definatly weighed over 10 lbs. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179785275  another view http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179785302  and finaly the release shot http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179785345  so right now we have got 2 fish and havent been fishing long. i through in a firetiger inline spinner and gets hit right when it hits the water i get the fish to the boat and it is another hamerhandle arought 26 inches i grab the leader to bring it in the boat and the fish swings its head and pops off good i didnt have to touch that slimey bugger lol.  so we start another drift around a weedbed and tinbanger gets another this ones a bit better around 28 inches. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179785607  so now we have 4 fish in the boat, o wait tinbanger gets another hit! http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179785697  nice around 30"" http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179785745  allright theres number 5.  so while drifting across a weedflat i through out a 6 inch white senko and start working it like a jerkbait i get it near the boat and i look down a very nice pike over 35"" is following my bait. but when i said ""follow"" to tinbanger the fish took off dang  .  so after that tinbanger hooks up agian and get the biggest fish of the day in the boat it measured 32 inches http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179785969 http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179786040  so now it looks like tinbanger is starting to kick my but he has caught 3 more fish then i have lol so i get back in the game with this little snot rocket   lol nice markings tho. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1179786152  but it was time to go so looks like tinbanger beat me today but dont worry ill get him back haha"
