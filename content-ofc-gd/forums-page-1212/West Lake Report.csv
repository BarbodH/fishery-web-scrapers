73763,huntervasili,2007-05-22 01:22:00,1604,"Well this weekend we decided to head up to west lake in Prince edward county... Left friday and returned today and not only did we have a great time but we also caught loads of fish... Started out with a stop to see Sam at Carra Outdoors, and we picked up some lures which proved useful out on the water, next up we got to our destination, West Lake Willows and spent the following days there having a great time... Scott, his wife, and father were all excellent hosts and Scott enabled us to catch a load of fish, and show us some spots for the days we were there...The first night out we caught three keepers and lots of others including whitebass, some perch and bullhead were released. Although it was pretty cold, and windy throughout the weekend we managed to catch a bunch of fish in one of the rental boats (At the moment i am actually somewhat bobbing back and forth because I have not adjusted to not being on teh water  )  First night we were guided for a couple of hours by Scott and these are some of the keepers    Next day we awoke at 330 not by chice but infact in anticipation and were on the water by 500 (in the morning of course) and as we were watching some TV this little guy came up and scratched at the reflection of a garbage bag on the inside of the cottage   Without any further delay we got out on the water, and it turned out to be a great morning lots of pics and a few keepers which went from the boat to be filleted and into the pan so no pics... this little guy was picture worthy   The view in the morning with sandbanks PP in the background   Then sunday we were again out all day coming back to base on occasion to fry up some fish and grab some lunch or dinner, and monday morning the same... We mainly did trolling these last couple of days to try and entice some bigger fish and maybe a pike and of course some more success.     And mondays mornings stringer was a full one minus one walleye slot we left incase we caught a biggun which never came...     Fortunately we saw some Conservation officers who checked us and our licences out... I was suprised but extremely glad to see em out there...  Overall a memorable and successful trip and we have got a freezer full of walleye fillets! Hope you all enjoyed the report as it took me too long to put it together  Bill"

73816,POLLIWOGG,2007-05-22 03:36:00,835,"I was afraid you had a picture of me running into that pile of rocks Sunday afternoon, not my proudest moment.  The highlight of the day was my first really big gar pike.  WE had that guy in a live trap last week and he ripped it to pieces, your lucky you escaped with your lives. Raccoons are everywhere  this year, someone told me its estimated  that they number in the hundreds of thousands in P.E.C."
