74279,Pinch,2007-05-23 05:40:00,231,I came across this while reading the paper online.  Now that is one big UGLY fish!!  World Record Carp
74316,ccmtcanada,2007-05-23 12:01:00,7971,You are right about the ulgy factor!!!  What a massive fish...looks like it has about 4 of the size carp I catch in it's belly!!!
74322,Photoz,2007-05-23 12:13:00,792,Hm m m  m  m   m    ?? The one I missed Saturday musta been about that size?
74325,MJL,2007-05-23 12:26:00,2427,"Seems like it's another 80+lb fish out of Rainbow. Ironically it was caught at peg 19, 1 peg away from where Gary Hagues caught his world record in November for the first and second times.  Minutes before he caught that fish, he managed to get a 69lb common carp.  I wonder how much groundbaiting those anglers at that lake actually do?  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/arti...in_page_id=1770"
74329,mattyk,2007-05-23 12:45:00,2110,thats one ugly carp!
74382,Victor,2007-05-23 16:12:00,1609,"o man, and it's a mirror too eh ..."
74384,wolfville,2007-05-23 16:17:00,396,"I think in that part of the world, mirrors are more common than here."
74472,Clampet,2007-05-23 22:38:00,1947,Imagine the weight on the end of the rod!
74481,dsn,2007-05-23 22:55:00,1018,  Thats a good point. I wonder would it movr slowly since its so big or would it give a tremendous battle.
74485,Daplumma,2007-05-23 22:59:00,1961,The only thing grosser than that fish is getting thrown into the polluted mess that the fish lived in.Big fish all the same. Joe
