Camped many years on Wanapetai Bay, and stayed those early years at Camp Wanikawin and on the Lower French at French River Lodge 2004 and 2005.  Last year was at Casa Blanca Lodge.  Any suggestions to walleye and smallmouth fishing patterns that time of year?  We have some, but always are open to new patterns.  Thanks,  Don C"
74042,Marty,2007-05-22 18:09:00,873,"The best smallie pattern up there is to ""bottle fish"".  Look for the plastic bottles marking rocks and throw tubes, slug-gos or small spinnerbaits.  The walleye pattern can be tough.   Although the deep reefs are always crowded, we've been doing very well with jig-minnows or jig-worms around deeper weed edges.   Most don't correlate weeds and walleyes but they sure work well for me.  Get a map of the water."
74045,mattyk,2007-05-22 18:15:00,2110,Look for fast water for the smallies and like marty said throw tubes.
74048,Raf,2007-05-22 18:22:00,3495,lots of smallies around everywhere but current areas are prime.  can't really help you with walleye as i don't fish them much.
