Definitely a Great Day"

74034,Fang,2007-05-22 17:50:00,1330,Way to go Goran  Reminds me to send you that secret recipe. I'll have to hit the bulk barn to remind myself what the heck went into that mess.  I should have stayed for a burger but you know I had strict instructions when to be home.  Stopped by Fish on line today and picked up a couple extra flavours of boilies  Maybe hit that spot 1 more time next weekend before changing over to chase salmon out on the big lake.
74084,Uncle Buck,2007-05-22 19:54:00,1000,"   Got up there Saturday, set up camp and ate...  after that went out on a paddle boat, note to self, Fat Man does not go in Paddle Boat... returned that and got a canoe, did some canoeing and then a little bit of fishing. couple of sunfish... not picture worthy...  went back for dinner, ate then the rain started...  woke up the next morning, to a grey sky, went for a hike thought about renting a boat, but Andrea was cold and didn't feel like sitting in an open boat the rest of the day, so we decided to pack it in and head home... weather wasn't looking too good anyways. left the park around 4, stopped by bass pro on the way home...  Sorry to Dissappoint Brian, Info greatly appreciated though!!"

I dont have bite alarms....my alarm is my finger around the line near the spool.  I cast out, reached down for my coffee and my rod almost flies out of my hands...LOL.  They sure are fun to bring in....nice going!"
