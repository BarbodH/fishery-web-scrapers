73760,Burtess,2007-05-22 01:18:00,901,"From Blockbuster.ca:  Movie and game rentals are due back at the date and time stated on the transaction receipt. There is no additional rental charge if a member keeps a rental item beyond the pre-paid rental period. However, if a member chooses to keep a rental item for more than a week after the end of the rental period, BLOCKBUSTER will automatically convert the rental to a sale on the eighth (8th) day after the end of the rental period. BLOCKBUSTER will post to the membership account and/or credit card the selling price for the item in effect at the time of the rental. If the member returns the item within 30 days of the sale date, BLOCKBUSTER will credit back to the membership account and/or credit card the amount previously charged. The member will be charged a one-time restocking fee of $1.75 per unit per transaction plus applicable taxes. These rental terms are subject to change without notice at any time. Available at all BLOCKBUSTER Canada stores. See store for complete terms and conditions. Membership rules apply for rental. BLOCKBUSTER name, design and related marks are trademarks of Blockbuster Inc. Â©2006 Blockbuster Inc. All rights reserved.  Just take back the two games and they should adjust your account.  You should only owe $1.75X2.....  It states within 30 days of the sales date, which is 8 days past the end of the rental period.  So you can have the games for whatever the rental period plus 38 days and still owe only $3.50...  Burt"
73767,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 01:26:00,933,"thanks for that info Burt, hmm, but he said ur owning the games now, there urs to keep, so if i renturn them ill only have to pay the restocking fee?  its been over 30 days"
73770,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 01:32:00,933,"ok i will take them back and see what happens, thnx for ur help, and quick reply"
73773,Rizzo,2007-05-22 01:37:00,4754,"no ""good"" advice for you other than however this works out, consider it a learning experience.  Read the fine print (ie see above post) and look for legal loopholes.   At the end of the day though, if you're guilty...I say pay up and make sure you don't make the same mistake twice.  Well, lets say don't do it a third time.  The price to me seems reasonable.  You had it so long past the due date the store would have to believe the games were never coming back.  Naturally there are others who would've wanted the same games, and the store would have to purchase new copies to satisfy their customers.  Telling people ""I'll call you when its in""  when its already 3 weeks late doesn't cut it, people will take their business elsewhere."
73775,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 01:40:00,933,"ok thnx Rizzo, but i am gonna take them back"
73776,Rizzo,2007-05-22 01:43:00,4754,"good luck bud, when all else fails may I suggest crying?  Man I had a lot of girlfriends who cried themselves out of some sticky situations (especially speeding tickets!!).  I say go in there and cry like a schoolgirl."
73783,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 01:58:00,933,"lmaooo hahaha, thats where U come in  thnx"
73973,Bitsmith2k,2007-05-22 14:53:00,396,dont worry about it messing up your credit.. it has to be over $100 to go on your bureau.
74002,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 16:35:00,933,"  for reall?? in that case im good to go , thnx   yeah i found my recieipt for the games and its been more than 38 days ago"
74022,Bitsmith2k,2007-05-22 17:22:00,396," yup.. for real.. but if they want to get picky, i'm sure they can add enough admin. fees and other costs to get your balance over $100.."
74054,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 18:43:00,933,"  k thnx for this, i hope they dont get picky"
74057,BITEME,2007-05-22 18:47:00,1969,YOUR TOAST!
74067,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 19:08:00,933,"thanks for ur advice BITME,"
74120,Burtess,2007-05-22 21:24:00,901,"At least return the games.  Not returning them and not paying the balance is stealing, isn't it???  You rented them according to the rental contract and you did not meet your obligations.  No wonder its getting more expensive to do everything these days....  Burt"
74121,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 21:26:00,933,thats in my plan

74127,FishHeadRic,2007-05-22 21:47:00,226,"Alex, You can always just walk in and cause a huge ruccas. Ask to talk to the manager and complain to him. If you cause enough of a stink in the place more than likely they'll just take em back to shut ya up.  Ric"
74147,Big Cliff,2007-05-22 22:44:00,6899,"Just like sppeding and then crying when you get a ticket. You made a mistake, pay up and chalk it up to a lesson learned. It wasn't their fault!"
74154,urbanangler1990,2007-05-22 23:09:00,933,"Ric, that looks more and more like what ill be doing, lol, thnx"
