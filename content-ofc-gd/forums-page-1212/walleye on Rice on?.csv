74046,Steelcat,2007-05-22 18:17:00,191,"I've been fishing for walleye in Rice Lake(Bewdley side).  Fishing was good last week, but yesterday because of it's right after saturday and sunday, the fishing pressure was very high, as well as the weather condition, fishing was slow.  I'm sure it will turn back to normal during weekdays.  The weeds in Rice is growing extremely fast right now, a sign of good fishing season this year."
74070,radar,2007-05-22 19:13:00,138,Thanks steelcat  I can't decide if I should hit Rice now for walleye or maybe Simcoe for pike. I've been wanting to hit early walleye on Rice for a few years now. You may have sold me.  Am I heading in the right direction with jigs and crankbaits on weed edges?  I'll probably launch outta BJ's in Bewdley
74076,Steelcat,2007-05-22 19:26:00,191,"Jig and grub will be my first choice.  But it really depends on the weather.  After a cold front or a day after weekend, fish will be slow, jig and grub is the way to go.  But when it's cloudy and wavy, you can try jerkbait along the weededge."
