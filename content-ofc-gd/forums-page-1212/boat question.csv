Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Didn't get to fish all long weekend because of this problem.  thanks,  lovetofish"
74029,BITEME,2007-05-22 17:35:00,1969,first thing is do you have water going into the intake if you do it should be coming out the port right away if not change your impeller dont keep running it like this its not a hard job to do
74033,lovetofish,2007-05-22 17:49:00,500,i did the impeller already and i still can't get water flow. its not plugged any where because i checked all the passage ways with the hose.  thinking i have an air leak some where in the housing or the gasket or water pipe gromet
74037,BITEME,2007-05-22 18:00:00,1969,could be an air leak but not likley as you are forcing water to the impeller not drawing it i would double check the repair job

It opened after about 1 min; the water was cold.  He said it would not open (much if at all) when idling in the driveway.  Hope that helps.  Entropy"
