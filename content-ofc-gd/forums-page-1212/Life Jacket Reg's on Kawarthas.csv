74206,JerseyDog,2007-05-23 01:17:00,190,"I don't want to ALWAYS wear a life jacket.  Sure, I might fall out of my stationary boat, in a waveless back bay, into 80 degree water, bonk my head and drown - but let's be honest, I'm more likely to get wiped out driving up North on the Hwy. 400 doing a modest 120km/h, properly belted in and surrounded by $35k worth of steel & sheet metal and loaded to the gills with the best safety equipment money can buy.  Sadly life is risky and sometimes I just wanna sit in my boat and cast some lures without the bother of a bulky, uncomfortable and unnecessary life jacket.  PS. When the water is cold, the weather is rough, or I'm running on wide open water, I have my floater on - I'm not stupid."
74269,kennyman,2007-05-23 04:15:00,737,"Although I pretty much always wear mine, I still think it should be optional for adults and mandatory for kids. Fishing the perch derby, my whole family (wife, kids and myself) wore one from the moment we got on the water until after we got off the boat. My Dad however never put one on at all. Funny thing, he barely swims and we all swim great. Go figure."

Your boat (assuming you bring yours here) must comply with the state safety regulations for your home state (if staying here less than 45 days). I believe where Ontario regulations are less stringent, the latter then applies."
