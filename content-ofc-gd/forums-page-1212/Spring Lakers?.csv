My results showed my lack of experience, I got skunked. I'm fishing a deep, gin clear lake (Skeleton lake).  I used the same techniques I used in the summer with not even a nibble.  The summer I'm able to do well enough on them. Any tips on where the lakers go in the spring time, I didn't really mark anything on the finder either. Any help is greatly appreciated! Cheers, -Graeme"

Here's a link with Pictures and Specific lures.  http://www.bluewaterbridge.com/viewtopic.php?t=118  I'm not sure where you are or how these techniques will work for you, but hopefully this will give some ideas."
