73823,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-22 04:06:00,191,Well said GCD!
73824,Fishmaster,2007-05-22 04:10:00,920,Couldn't agree more ...
73834,motv8tr,2007-05-22 07:19:00,2587,"Yup, I concur Dawg...especially since I haven't been able to get out and fish myself yet  they are very much appreciated.  Maureen"
73844,Marc Thorpe,2007-05-22 09:18:00,621,"Yes,Glen you are right,thanks I enjoy reading the reports also Most enjoyable"
73847,pikehunter,2007-05-22 10:13:00,1659,"Could not agree more GCD. It takes time to prepare a fishing post with the pictures and everything. Sometimes I go out and catch nothing so don't bother to post that. And then other times it takes a lot of time to post the pics, resizing and the rest of the effort that is all a part of it. So to those who have made recent fishing posts I join in with the other posters and offer my appreciation.  I will have to tear myself away from the chores at hand and work so as to get out   fishing this week in order to make a post!  Hmmmm...Crap! I should have loaded up this early morning and headed out since I couldn't sleep   anyway!"
73850,aplumma,2007-05-22 10:33:00,6896,Yup when ever someone posts a trip I always enjoy the reading even if it is a fishless post it is fun to fish along with that person when you read it. Well said Glen   Art
73857,ccmtcanada,2007-05-22 11:11:00,7971,"Glen...you are right...I do take the time to read practically every thread that's on here when I get the chance.  Even if it's something I know nothing about...like boat motors, fancy GPS and fish finders etc...  I cant offer anything insightful in those posts.  I try to comment on as many report threads as possible...I know the effort it takes too.  Great thread Glen...and to all posters...THANKS!"
73962,tbayboy,2007-05-22 14:30:00,1497,Well said Glen.  Like you I may not respond to them all the reports but I really do appreciate them whether its something that I learn from them or just the enjoyment of a great set of pics and a well told story.
73972,mattyk,2007-05-22 14:49:00,2110,i also agree. Thanks to all. Makes the day go by quickly.
73974,Entropy,2007-05-22 14:54:00,747,"Well if someone was willing to 'donate' a digi cam to me, I would post pics too.  Offers?  Entropy"
74035,BITEME,2007-05-22 17:55:00,1969,NICE!!!!!!!!
74079,setomonkey,2007-05-22 19:33:00,872,"Well said, GCD, to me the reports are the core of OFC. It's fun to read about other topics like boat questions etc. but at the end of it my favourite part of this board is reading others' reports, seeing pics, and sharing tips.  Mike"
74080,huntervasili,2007-05-22 19:34:00,1604,"Thnaks to the countless others who also keep us going when we aren't fortunate enough to head out... Reading some of the reports allows us to see what a lake is like and what a great time is had by many... Although there may be a little work involved in posting a report I enjoy doing it in hope that others will enjoy reading it and seeing the pictures, and sometimes the pics. I post my reports in hope that others too will do the same as i know some of my reports have contained such things as a couple dink perch or a couple baby bows or browns... and hope that others will contribute even if they think it is ""unworthy"" as it is by no means so... Hope to see more and more reports as the seasons progress and open up... Tight lines and good fishing to everyone...  Bill"
74158,PERCHER,2007-05-22 23:42:00,787,I also enjoy every post made on this board.And many thanks to all.Dan
74166,Nanook,2007-05-22 23:58:00,565," Ain't that what this 'Board is all about, Glen? I dont post [m]any fishing escapades as I havent got out too often in the last coupla years, AND I havent mastered the art of taking/posting pic's. Nevertheless, I come on to this 'Board almost every night,and get great enjoyment reading 'bout other people's good times. On this G'damned Dialup it takes most of the evening to get thro' them all, then I dont have time to post  To all our Bro's and Sis's; keep the posts coming, it keeps me out  of mischief !!!!"
74273,Mike the Pike,2007-05-23 04:31:00,3421,Thanks GCD it took me 3 and half hours to make my recent Quinte report. I also enjoy the other reports that many put in huge amounts of time to post. GCD you are a good redneck gentleman.  MTP
