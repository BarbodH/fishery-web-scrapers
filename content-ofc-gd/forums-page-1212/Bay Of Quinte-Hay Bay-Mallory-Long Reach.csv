Landed 6 eyes on Uzick Spinners in 7.5' of water. Fishing with 20 other boats in the area.  Went out Sunday with my Dad and fished the flats in the morning,counted 28 boats from Ram Is to Blakewoods and 27 more in the flats (Busy holiday weekend fishing traffic) and hit a couple and fished in the evening in front of Bayview and hit another - all on Uzicks.  Took a spin on Monday morning to Mallory to check it out and found 6 boats fishing the south side of Trompour PT (jigging and trolling), marked some fish on the north side of MAllory in over 20' but couldn't entice them to strike. Headed to Thompsons and started to troll and withing 5 minutes, I hit a nice 21"" on an Orange Uzick Spinner about 125' back on a flat line.  Wind blew Monday afternoon and evening so didn't get out again.  People staying at Bayview all were bringing in catches of walleyes and quite a few pike.  Everyone had a great holiday weekend.  Stay Tuned"
