73661,beastmaster,2007-05-21 18:21:00,1,"Just found this board and want to say hi to all.  Wanted to go fishing today got too late.  I don't have a boat and have limited gear so I was wondering if there are any good spots within a couple hours drive of the gta?  I like to take my dogs and I only take what I eat mainly pickerel and bass.  I usually try for salmon in the season as my wife eats it.  I am a rookie but learning so any help would be great as I have rediscovered my boyhood love, grins. Thanks all..."
