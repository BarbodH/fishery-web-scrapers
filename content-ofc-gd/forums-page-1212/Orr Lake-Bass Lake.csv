74167,boddah,2007-05-23 00:00:00,61,I'm looking at trying a couple of new lakes this year and was wondering if anyone had any input to Orr Lake or Bass Lake.  Both are near Orilla.
74225,motv8tr,2007-05-23 02:27:00,2587,"Orr lake is actually closer to Midland than Orillia  , now having said that, although I drive by it every day i go to work, I have never fished it, and I don't think there are any public launches but I'm not positive about that.  Don't know anything about Bass lake sorry...  Maureen"
74326,aniceguy,2007-05-23 12:38:00,1094,nice little lake.  Soft sand bottom with little to no structure.  There is a boat launch on the far side of the lake that with some care can launch most boats.  Lots of smallies in there with a few large mouth mixed in.  I found the weed bed on the opposite side of the lake from the launch to be most productive.
74387,setomonkey,2007-05-23 16:25:00,872,"Bass Lake is a nice little lake on Hwy 12. There's a public access road on the north side where you could launch a small boat, and there's probably a launch at the provincial park that's on the southeast end. We launched a canoe from the beach on the east side of the lake.  Mix of smallies and largemouth, and lots of decent-sized panfish (crappie, perch, pumpkinseeds).  Though it's a small lake, there can be a lot of jetski and boat traffic on it (there are cottages all around) on weekends.  Mike"
