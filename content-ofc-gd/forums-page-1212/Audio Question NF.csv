74039,Headhunter,2007-05-22 18:03:00,5703,"I have a question about hooking up a Sub-woofer to my main audio system. I have a Rotel Pre-Amp and Power Amp system, but the pre-amp does not have a ""RCA"" style out-put, specifically for a Sub. It has no sub-woofer outputs.  It has four line outs, two of which are currently hooked directly to the main power amp. My question, how would you recommend hooking a sub woofer to this system. I'm really trying to stay away from running speaker cables from the main Paradigms to the sub. My concern being, if I buy a cable that has stereo rca's on one end and a single rca plug at the other, will I be looking at ""phase"" problems in the low frequency ranges? Does anyone have any other suggestions? Thanks for the help! HH"

74064,Headhunter,2007-05-22 19:06:00,5703,"Thanks for the link DouG! Unfortunately, it doesn't cover my concern. My Pre-Amp does not have a sub-woofer line output. If it did, it would be a no brainer. It has left and right line outs and I'm wondering how to hook a sub woofer to both left and right outputs, without creating phase problems. My sub woofer will be powered! Thanks for trying! Anyone else? HH"
74072,tonyb,2007-05-22 19:18:00,1637,"Can't you split the signal from the other line-outs using a Y RCA cable?  You will lose your fade capability, but that's isn't too important."
74083,Headhunter,2007-05-22 19:41:00,5703,"Tony, that's what I was thinking, but after speaking with some electronics dudes, they suggested doing that could cause major phasing problems between the main speaker system and the sub. HH"
74091,douG,2007-05-22 20:14:00,2693,"Try using just one (left or right) feed for your sub.  Almost all low frequency stuff is common to both channels.  I don't like tying amp outputs together, but not for phasing reasons, I don't think it's a good idea for the amp (or preamp)."
74137,Dutch,2007-05-22 22:29:00,831,"I don't think you use a pre-amp for subs, but I am not an expert, by any stretch.  Check here:  http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/index.php? http://www.digitalhome.ca/forum/ http://www.digitalhome.ca/forum/  Great information."
