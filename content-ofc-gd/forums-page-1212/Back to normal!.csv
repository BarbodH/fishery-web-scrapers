He told me I had to limit my computer time to 15 minutes a day. Now it ain't easy trying to fix, build and maintain websites when you only have fifteen minutes of typing each day. I even used a stopwatch so as to maximize my time! I bought a new mouse pad and wrist bumper for my keyboard with that cushy gel stuff. I must say it is very different and I can type without pain now. I was in the doctors today and most nerve response has gone back to normal. Apparently I was on the way to carpal tunnel issues had I not rested and changed my work station. So with a wireless system now I am more comfy and good to go! To those whose emails I had to ignore...sorry...but we are back in business again! I had to follow these orders strictly or risk no fishing and no computer for life perhaps...a pretty easy decision to make actually."
