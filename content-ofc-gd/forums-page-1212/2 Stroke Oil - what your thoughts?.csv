74397,mdej,2007-05-23 16:59:00,98,"I use the AMSOil HP Injector in my oil injected Evinrude.  It runs perfectly, little smoke and a lot less smell.  I also use the AMSOil Interceptor is all my other 2 strokes (chainsaw, linetrimmers etc).  Great products.  Dan The Man, the Lucas Oil is suppose to be very good as well, however I have never had a reason to try is since going with AmsOil."
71924,Nemo,2007-05-15 18:01:00,727,Just going to fill up my gas containers for my 2 hp and 15 hp. I usually put in the Esso brand 2 stroke oil from the gas station.  Should I be concerned?
71925,Fisherman,2007-05-15 18:04:00,7201,"Just something about Esso that annoys me, first the fire to make prices go up, then the power outage, what's next.  I prefer the Amsoil Synthetic, no smoke, no plug fouling."
71926,keram,2007-05-15 18:06:00,585," You should feel happy, you are going fishing shortly  :clapping:"
71933,Sinker,2007-05-15 18:24:00,8692,"I use the oil recomended by my engine manufacturer.  I used to run the cheap stuff, until I got real bad carbon build up, so much so that it plugged the exaust port on my engine, then I looked on the oil bottle and realized the ash content in the cheap oil is way higher than the recomended oil. The good stuff is more $, but worth it in the long run I think. I think I paid $40 for 4L, and it usually lasts me a full season in my 40HP. Its the only lu;bricant in there, so may as well get the good stuff.  I have a mariner engine, and use merc oil thru it. Less smoke, and not as much carbon build up.  Sinker"
71934,Terry,2007-05-15 18:30:00,14456,I started using Amsoil Synthetic saber or something like that..you can use it at 100 to 1 no matter what you motor takes. my auger take 25 to 1  but amsoil at 100 to 1 ran great and same with my 2.5 hp  it states 50 to 1 but saber can be ran at 100 to 1 and sure runs nice
71936,Zib,2007-05-15 18:41:00,369,Synthetic oil is nice because it has less smoke & it doesn't separate from the gas when stored. Regular oil will separate from the gas when stored for long periods & cause the fuel system to get gummed up.
71939,ssauvain,2007-05-15 18:46:00,77, If your engine takes 25 to 1...you use the 100to1...what is the mix rate per gallon???? I am confused
71942,Garyv,2007-05-15 18:53:00,547,  1st I use Amsoil 100 to 1  never had a problem in the last 8 years.  As to ratio look here  http://www.csgnetwork.com/marineoilfuelcalc.html
71943,Terry,2007-05-15 18:59:00,14456,8 oz.  	per 6 U.S. gallons  	100:1  5L = 50ml 1 imp gal.= 1.25 oz  I think
71950,ssauvain,2007-05-15 19:22:00,77,"So Garyv, I use the amosil 100 to 1mix and mix it at a rate of 100 to 1 even if I have been mixing 25 to 1???? So if I do 100 to 1 of the amosil I use this rate? 6.4 ounces to 5 USgallons"
71955,Daplumma,2007-05-15 19:35:00,1961,"I have been using Amsoil 16 yrs in all sorts of 2 strokes from weedeaters to high performance race motors on jet skiis with out single oil related failure.I usually mix it 80 to one,burns clean and doesn't smoke.I run quicksilver in my merc with automatic mixing but if it was a premix motor I would run Amsoil in it.The only down side is if the motor is going to sit for a while you should fog it or put some regular oil in the cylinder to coat the walls because the Amsoil does not stick to the walls very well and rust may develope.Hope this helps. Joe"
71956,vance,2007-05-15 19:37:00,719,They key question here is HOW OLD are your motors? if they are pre 1960 I wouldn't go 100 to 1 maybe 50 to 1 but no less.If the 2 hp is air cooled I would stick with the ratio that you have been using even though you might switch to synthetic. Check out this thread from Iboats on mix ratios.  http://forums.iboats.com/showthread.php?t=158072   vance
71958,Terry,2007-05-15 19:45:00,14456,I wouldn't  saber does as much lubricating at 100 to 1 as regular oil does at 25 to 1 if it's older and worn you can make it 80 to 1 but amsoil  guaranties  it
71963,Nemo,2007-05-15 19:57:00,727,"Thanks Guys.  Merc 15hp 1994 50:1,  and the  2 hp Yamha is 100:1 and is a 2000. Funny the guy at the Marina said to use synthetic on this one but at 50:1 not 100:1 and it would last forever but I find it is smoky with lots of crap out the exhaust. It is water cooled as well."
71965,vance,2007-05-15 20:13:00,719,"Just remember the oil ratio is for wide open throtle running,if you are trolling all the time  or running slow you don't need that much oil.I have a 40 merc oil injected that I have taken back to the dealer twice for low oil consumption and he says you are not driving it fast enough to need alot of oil and he is right because if I run WOT the oil tank level plummets.   vance"
71984,ecmilley,2007-05-15 21:14:00,2163,when i switched from dino oil to synthetic in the snowmobile really noticed a difference in performance hardly ever fouled a power valve with the amsoil or blue marble oils. Now everything i own is 4 stroke. just use yamalube in it
71990,Billy Bob,2007-05-15 21:31:00,5865,When my 1985 50 hp Johnson VRO was new and under warranty I used oil sold with the Johnson name. But for the last 20 years or so I have used Walmart's brand outboard oil. It called Tech something and cost about $8 a gallon. I have not had ANY motor problems what so ever using this oil. I do a LOT of trolling with this motor on Lake Erie walleyes and have not had a carbon build up in all these years.  A LOT of the special oils are only special in name and price.
72008,Kerry,2007-05-15 22:29:00,383,"Nemo, I've been using the Esso oil in both my sled (04) Easymix and boat (72) Outboard formula for the last three years.It is a synthetic blend,Doesn't smoke like normal oil and doesn't rip your lungs out either.Good to mix to 100 to 1 or for oil injection.Haven't changed my plugs in two years on either.Do yourself a favour and look at your local National Grocers if you have one nearby.Most I have paid is 3.99 liter.Sometimes it's 3.49.Your Esso station will want 5.75+ tax.  Kerry"
72052,aplumma,2007-05-16 00:12:00,6896,Why would you use a cheaper oil that might save you 20.00 or so a season in your outboard ? I think I would buy 1 or 2 less lures and get the best oil available.   Art
72061,Bernie,2007-05-16 00:30:00,3190,When engines come apart in our shop it's not hard to tell the cheaper oil deposits on internal parts. There is a difference.
72073,Nemo,2007-05-16 00:47:00,727,Ok went to the CTC and picked up some Nautilus Two Stroke. They had no merc or Amsoil.  Thanks Folks
72102,boatman,2007-05-16 01:30:00,350,"Amsoil is available at CTC. It only seems to come in a 1 L bottle. I picked some up recently on Fisherman's advice, but I have yet to try it."
72105,vance,2007-05-16 01:36:00,719,I have used amsoil for three years now and today I checked my plugs and put them back in -the same plugs for 3 years-I use my motor alot and the plugs look almost as good as the new set I have waiting to go in.  vance
72106,Sinker,2007-05-16 01:41:00,8692, EXACTLY!
