GPS - Explore new areas, find my way back to the car/boat launch, find the nearest Timmies/tackle shop! send/receive photos send/receive fishing related calls Charge my spoons with the flash. Look up techniques on the water -  When I'm not catching anything I'll try anything. Look up knots - I always forget lesser used knots like the nail knot. Look up water levels and fishing reports. Weather radar. Basically the entire knowledge base of the internet in the palm of my hand."
