797926,Terry,2013-07-13 15:58:00,14456,what is happening when you turn/try to turn the nuts is the shaft turning are they not moving..2 nuts.. is there one screwed down to a second one on the threaded shaft
797945,scugpg,2013-07-13 20:18:00,1373,get an open or round wrench and flathead screwdriver. (tm bolt should have a slot to insert screwdriver) flathead will hold bolt in place while you back off nut.
