As you all know, shore fishing is really hard and popular places tend to be heavily pressured. My mission is to go to these places and challenge myself to see if I fish could still be caught with skills and technique. Even though places are heavily pressured, most of them time you have novices who only know how to catch panfishes. More bigger fish for me .In this video, it's just crappie fishing Enjoy! "
