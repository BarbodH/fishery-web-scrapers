He will fish for about 5 minutes usually then he's done....lol....lucky for me he just loves being in the boat. Last night i find out he is not only excellent company but an accomplished net man too!   We got about a hundred jackfish before the walleye started to bite( slight exaggeration....but lots anyway), then hooked 3 beauty walleye and lost a few more. small 1/8th oz jig with large minnows, they did not seem to want to touch the leeches.....but jack was all over them.....lol....mum is going to freak when she sees the video.....she hates them!         NET MAN JACK (change setting to HD in Youtube)                                              Jack told me he wants to go fishing again today....LOVE MY BOY!   fish fry for us for lunch and if we get some today.....a fish fry for all at work on Sunday.....thats the way to grease the wheels   Tight lines all,   Simon."
