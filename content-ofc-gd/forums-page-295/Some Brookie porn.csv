797672,Ron,2013-07-11 16:22:00,1683,"Some nice specimens Al. Did you manage to catch many over the 22 inch mark?  Cheers, Ron..."

797710,fishindevil,2013-07-11 21:05:00,6254,Incredible !!!! They look amazing !!!!!
797726,Guidofisherman,2013-07-11 22:37:00,206,"These fish follow a 4 year cycle based on my Cn'R data. This is the year of the bigger fish and the resurgence of the little guys. There have been some ""big boys"" over 22"" this year, but in the river, the length of the fish is only one factor. The other is girth. Some fish have 14-16"" girths. In the lake they are longer but not as ""football"" shaped."
797774,Moosebunk,2013-07-12 11:58:00,3970,"Awesome Al.  Surprised to hear water temps have gotten that warm there already.  Fishing northeast end of the lake last week where brookies & lakers swim, surface temps were 51-54F all week long.  Hope the rest of your summer fishing goes well and we'll likely be seeing ya later in the season."
