797536,mattp33,2013-07-10 23:04:00,290,"I need to replace this but The 1 I got only has 5 wires, why does this have 6?  I JUST got the boat.     Should I just grab a test light and figure out what gets power and when and just connect a 7 way round to it? "
797540,Terry,2013-07-10 23:20:00,14456,the black/yellow and black/green must be tail light right and left and they must both go to the one beside the white...never seen that but can't be anything else..... imho
797541,Roy,2013-07-10 23:25:00,13728,You can probably get rid of the blue unless you have electric trailer brakes. Man that's a bad looking plug!
797544,Terry,2013-07-10 23:31:00,14456,or disc brakes
797545,Rich,2013-07-10 23:34:00,3927,6th is trailer brakes as said. If your boat isn't 5000 lbs you shouldn't need them though.
797554,mattp33,2013-07-10 23:58:00,290,"The trailer has surge brakes, I was told the 5th wire will disable the brakes when backing up.  Makes sense but then I saw 6 wires.  I think I should break out the test light!"
797555,mattp33,2013-07-10 23:58:00,290,The crazy part about the horrible looking plug is the it still works!!!
797556,davey buoy,2013-07-11 00:00:00,5505,Maybe tape up those bare wires quick than.Sure doesn't look pretty though.
797557,Roy,2013-07-11 00:02:00,13728,"Oh good...if it still works, keep using it."
797558,Terry,2013-07-11 00:02:00,14456,that is correct  and as stated the black/yellow and black/green must be tail light right and left and they must both go to the one beside the white..which should the brown wire on the other plug
797560,misfish,2013-07-11 00:08:00,29133," Terry would,,,,,,  If it aint broke,,,,,,,,,,well"
797564,Ron,2013-07-11 00:33:00,1683,The blue wire should only have power when vehicle is in reverse. This goes to a power valve and prevents fluid applied to brakes while backing up.
