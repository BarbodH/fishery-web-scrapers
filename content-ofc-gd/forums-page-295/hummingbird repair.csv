Call Hummingbird anyway, they may provide you a service dealer near you. Garmin bent over backwards for me to get my used unit repaired. Let's hope Hummingbird is as good for customer service. I just installed my new Hummingbird today. If someone's thinking why I didn't go with Garmin, it was simply the deal I got."

797761,lowerunit,2013-07-12 02:30:00,53,Might be cheaper to send it to humminbird in the states. They charge a flat rate . I sent mine to North Bay very good to deal with but was a little pricey.
