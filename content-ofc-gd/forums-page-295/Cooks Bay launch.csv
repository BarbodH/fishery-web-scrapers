797928,Dan668,2013-07-13 16:28:00,1120,Might have some time to get out tomorrow afternoon. Usually fish thorah but figured I'd try for largies this time. Can you guys point me out to a good launch? Only time I've ever fished cooks was for perch years ago not on my own boat. Has anyone fished cooks lately? Wondering how the action is. Was in honey harbor last week. Tons of pike. Few nice bass.

797985,Dan668,2013-07-14 00:17:00,1120,"Most likely keswick. The east side. Thanks, ill look that one up!"
