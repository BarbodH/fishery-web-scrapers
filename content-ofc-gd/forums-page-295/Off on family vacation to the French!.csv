My family first started to go to this place (Moonlight Bay Cottages) in the early 70's. Cut my teeth fishing there and have been back numerous times since then. I figured that it would be a great place for my kids to learn a few things, like dock fishing and what not. Anyway, I will be posting some pics when we get back, likely of the panfish type, but one never know for sure, do they. Have a great week folks and see yah when we get back! HH"

797813,Headhunter,2013-07-12 17:48:00,5703,"Thanks and funny you mention that Roy... Thursday next week, I have to drive my daughter to Kearney for a week of camp. That'll put me only a few minutes from Powasson and driving right by TJ's as well! Timing won't be right for dropping in on Bernie though...by the time I go by, he'll already be sitting at the cottage enjoying the view! HH"
