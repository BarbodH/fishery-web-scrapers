797385,walleye_man,2013-07-09 23:54:00,135,Well I had another unreal day today Started the day with smallies and broke my pb. Yes there is loads of EAP but this fish was big. 4.6 pounds on the new scale    Then I had quite the  surprise as this big old gator grabbed a smallie I had hooked boatside...was pretty wild to experience for sure      After banging off another 25 smallies we decided it was time to hit a different lake for largies  Got a bunch of little guys but my buddy Jesse took the cake with this toad    Was quite the day! Hope you enjoyed the pics! Untill next time!
