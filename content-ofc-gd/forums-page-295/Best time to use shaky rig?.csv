797943,manitoubass2,2013-07-13 20:08:00,11391,"I like using your typical cigar style worms in black/silver or a natural colour. I like to trim off an inch or so making it around 4"" for bass or about 3.5"" for walleye. For bass ill use this technique around deadheads or on/around reefs, 12-25 fow. Usually use 8lb fluoro on a 6'6 or 6'8 med rod with a spinning reel. Get my bait to where i want it, hold the rod tip at 11 o'clock and just gently shake the rod tip, stop, repeat and then occasionally pop it up a good foot or so. Walleye is about the same but only right at pre spawn or fall"

798016,okumasheffield,2013-07-14 02:59:00,318,Any preferred shaky worms? 
798019,manitoubass2,2013-07-14 03:46:00,11391,"Yep, the black silver are yum, the more natural color are mayzuo purny worms"
