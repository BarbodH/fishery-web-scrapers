797468,Can_38,2013-07-10 17:45:00,152,Appears to be an old rusted cotter pin which I assume needs to be removed?  This is all new to me and any advice would be appreciated.

797491,Can_38,2013-07-10 19:48:00,152,Cotter pin broke while trying to pull it out = great.

797496,HTHM,2013-07-10 19:52:00,4082,Use a long punch to get the remnants of the old cotter pin out. Or a finishing nail with the point ground off.
797497,HTHM,2013-07-10 19:53:00,4082,Great minds think alike!
797498,dhickey,2013-07-10 20:05:00,1038,You may want to put some penetrating oil on it before you try driving it through. If you don't have a long punch you can the but end of a drill bit after you let the oil work its magic.

797918,OhioFisherman,2013-07-13 15:05:00,6623,You might want to look for a brass or stainless cotter pin in your spare time? A marine store or decent nut and bolt supplier should have them?
797920,'Kota'sDad,2013-07-13 15:17:00,7,"Can_38, can't tell what motor you're working with but if it uses a shear pin, like the older small h.p. Johnsons, be sure you have several extras and always have one or two with you in the boat . . . . . plus a pair of pliers to remove that cotter key! If you do not have a dealer near where you can pick up several shear pins, just Google ""outboard shear pin material"". There is a variety of readily available matrials you can use to cut your own pins."
