The little one is not quite 16 months old and wasn't to keen on the pfd and that she was not able to go wherever she wanted.  But she was very happy when the goldfish crackers came out.  "
797879,Sinker,2013-07-13 03:26:00,8692,Ah yes. The goldfish. I still use those....they work!  Your getting lots of great use out of the new boat!  S.
797978,chris.brock,2013-07-13 23:57:00,4053,"looks like fun, looks pretty calm out there, I guess the gold fish make this count as a fishing report (Hahaha)"
798046,kickingfrog,2013-07-14 13:24:00,8333," Never underestimate the power of the goldfish.  That's the idea.  I (actually we, my wife and I) had kicked around the idea of a new boat that was a level or two bigger. But the concern was that with two young kids that it wouldn't be used enough to justify the years of monthly payments. So my wife sugested I get Rizzo's. If it didn't get used much, we at least wouldn't be making payments. And if it did get used then we would have part of a downpayment on a bigger boat in a few years. She's a smart girlâ€¦ not sure why she's with me, but some questions are better left unasked."
