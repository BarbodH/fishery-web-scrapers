796527,Rizzo,2013-07-05 00:11:00,4754,"Well that's a big body of water! We decided to launch out of Belle River based on Lew's advice. If you read my other post I was fishing for St Clair musky for the first time, and trying to get a friend his first ever.  Looked at a map and saw a shallow point stretching out not too far from the launch so we decided to try over there. Never having been there, I decided to troll over to see if we could find any structure...not really. Now I like to troll fast. I tied on a shallow raider in firetiger flavour for my buddy and started to troll at a healthy pace (6.5 to 7 mph). Couldn't have been in the water 15 seconds when the rod buckles (it will do that at 6.5 mph!). What a start to the day. Just a little guy at around 32 inches but when its your first its a giant! We eventually found a weedy hump, and my buddy found out what a real musky looks like! Nailed this 46 incher and he was shaking the rest of the day    I finally got in on the action with a 36 and a 44 (or so) that we lost at boatside. Had one more rip that didn't hook up. We have a new musky addict in the fold!"
796528,BillM,2013-07-05 00:16:00,17367,Nice!!!!  I love the colours of those St.Clair fish!
796529,kickingfrog,2013-07-05 00:18:00,8333,Awesome stuff Roger!  Glad there were no smallmouth there to mess with your troll.
796532,Rizzo,2013-07-05 00:21:00,4754,haha...did stop once to cast and had lots of smallies follow my sledge but no takers. Couldn't cast too long because my buddy just had a surgery and was still tender
796533,spincast,2013-07-05 00:27:00,3279,"nice going.  Nothing like success on some new water, targeting a new species."
796535,ketchenany,2013-07-05 00:38:00,3229,"  You love all of the colours, you just can't eat them! Lol .Next weekend I'll  get a few kids between 2 and 6 Holdinga rods, in a small pond, they can't wait.  Nice catch Rizzo."
