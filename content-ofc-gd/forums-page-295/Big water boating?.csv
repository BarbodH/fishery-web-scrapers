797735,OhioFisherman,2013-07-12 00:01:00,6623,"Art, Marinettes were very common in this area, a good boat, I can't recall any complaints from their owners.  My buddy had a 28x11 Pacemaker with twin crusaders also a good boat but fuel prices can limit you?"
797772,aplumma,2013-07-12 11:02:00,6896,I gave up years ago on worrying about the cost of gas I joined the evil empire and bought stock in them. The profit from my shares offsets the cost of gas for all of my toys. lol  I usually only burn about 50 gal a month in the 9 month of boating so it isn't that bad. I do have to say though I love the sound of the twins idling and when you give her the go juice.   Art
797508,jedimaster,2013-07-10 20:57:00,3472,Just wondering what you guys would think about boating in Georgian Bay and Huron on a regular basis to get to a cottage property versus the ferry or driving around? Say from wasaga 200km's on the water to manatoulin? A friend of mine is considering this. I told him he is retarded and to just drive. Anyone spend time on huron and Georgian bay?
797510,buick14,2013-07-10 21:03:00,741,Sounds like he should skip the property and buy a yacht
797511,jedimaster,2013-07-10 21:03:00,3472,He already bought the property.
797513,davey buoy,2013-07-10 21:05:00,5505,"My first 21 years at Bluewater beach,lake front.That bay can get nasty in 20 mins. This is not a friendly lake when winds come from the west.Sell the property lol.What makes a fellow think like that?"
797515,Bill Shearer,2013-07-10 21:18:00,456,"He has to get a grip on reality. If he is going by himself, he should make sure to file a boating plan with next of kin. If he plans on taking anybody with him, he should file with the health department. Hopefully they will commit him."

797520,HTHM,2013-07-10 21:27:00,4082,"From a time standpoint, 200 kms at 50 kph = 4 hours. If he has a fast enough boat. From a fuel standpoint, 200 kms at 13l/100 = ~$30 on fuel. In a boat at least $120. He won't save time or money so the answer is self-evident. Drive, don't boat."
797521,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-10 21:49:00,10439,You can double that fuel figure. I used over $200 on my recent trip and that was 100kms each way plus trolling time. I ran at approximately 40-50kph and made the trip in 3 1/2 hours each way so that's 7 hours for a 200km trip.  Much cheaper to drive and take the ferry. Faster too!!!
797522,irishfield,2013-07-10 22:06:00,26272,Tell him to buy an airplane.. the fuel bill with be less than the truck!
797529,Fisherman,2013-07-10 22:29:00,7201,"Is he allowed to drive on regular roads?  Please let us know when, so we can avoid him and his train of thoughts."
797532,fishindevil,2013-07-10 22:32:00,6254,Another guy that we will read about in the obituaries !!!! And he will make all the rescuers and first responders at risk going out to recover his dumb @ss  what is he thinking ???
797535,dhickey,2013-07-10 22:55:00,1038,You might want to let your friend know that if a storm rolls by the waves can and do hit about 4-6 ft with swells that leave you speaking to God.... He better buy one hell of a good boat or  a reliable truck. I would go with the truck....
797539,FloatnFly,2013-07-10 23:15:00,1640,"  not only this, but imagine loading your boat with all your gear as well, if it was only a 20km boat ride, go for it, 200km forget about"
797546,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-10 23:37:00,4399,200 kms by boat....LOL... That ranks right up there with the dumbest thing I have ever read here....and that is saying something!!!!  And if this genius is thinking about taking his wife and kids along call the authorities.
797550,Whopper,2013-07-10 23:50:00,2174,Yunno I've seriously thought about that
797551,FloatnFly,2013-07-10 23:50:00,1640,"a 200k boat ride isn't abnormal, trent severn waterway anyone?   just not on the open waters of georgian bay lol"
797552,aplumma,2013-07-10 23:53:00,6896,I run a 28 ft x 11ft twin 318 boat and it gets about 2.5 kms per 3.7 liters This is a boat size that can take a 6-8 ft blowup safely. I would burn 296 liters one way. No way no how would I do the trip.   Art
797553,Roy,2013-07-10 23:57:00,13728,Don't even drive around.  Trailer to Tobermory and ferry to South Baymouth. I'm surprised you'd even put this on here.
797571,woodenboater,2013-07-11 00:57:00,2277,"Dude should have considered this dilemna before signing the papers for the property. What is 'regular' ? Every weekend ?  Round trip for a boat and trailer on the Big Canoe will be around $200 plus $ for however many people are making the trip. I'd be hitting the road if it were me so you're not tied to the ferry schedule and the boring drive down from Tobermory. 'Course '69 can be a hassle as well.  Drive > Ferry > Boating, in this case"
797584,BillM,2013-07-11 02:08:00,17367," In one day?  Yeah, that's abnormal, lol.  I've done 70 miles in one day and that was enough for me.."
797609,fishindevil,2013-07-11 08:45:00,6254,I have done the same as bill M and that was brutal I have went from port Newcastle to port credit and back in a boat and there was  decent true 3-4ft southwesterly waves and that was quite the ride and we were only 4 miles offshore to avoid the near shore chop and shipping traffic and sailing race around Toronto islands and my bud and I are very experienced boaters and that was an experience we also crossed Lake Ontario lots of times over to olcott NY and went from Oshawa harbor to the niagara bar in rough conditions !!!! All it would take for your buddy to be screwed would be a cold water upwelling and have a temp inversion and instant fog !!  And he would die !!!!!! Better give him a good shake and get some sense into him ??? Or let him read all theses posts !!!!!!  Oh ya plus GB had low water conditions and shoals and islands as well as the big ships and barges at any time so he really needs to know theses things !!!!! Like Roy said in his post why ??????????????????
797686,jedimaster,2013-07-11 17:52:00,3472,I have been slowly convincing him to buy a boat and leave it moored at his cottage and drive and take the ferry.... He is slowly coming around. Glad I am not the only one that thinks he is crazy.  I told him an equivalent would be picking a day with a thunderstorm and paddling a 14 foot canoe from Beaverton to barrie.
797718,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-11 21:42:00,8243,"I'll give him 1 single experience fighting 1 meter or more chop for 20 minutes and he will soon realize how stupid this thing he thinks he can do is. If he thinks this is an option tells me he is an inexperienced boater and shouldn't have a boaters card. Actually that should be a question on the boat test. Answer ""yes"" and you are never be allowed to pilot one of those floating noodles.  If he is going to try this with his family he should be reported to the Childress Aid Society. The thought is just plain idiotic. Not worth even typing one more word."
797725,OhioFisherman,2013-07-11 22:22:00,6623," This, I had a 25 foot Searay Sundancer, it had a 70 - 75 gallon fuel tank. 233hp Mercruiser and a top speed of around 33MPH, it could handle rougher water, but you might not at top speed.  Gas was sort of cheap back then, a buck forty or so a gallon, with it at or near 4 bucks a gallon now?"
797730,aplumma,2013-07-11 23:12:00,6896,"I have a 70 gallon tank it is a 1985 marinette which is an all aluminum boat it is really built tough and it has seen it's fair share of bad weather. The twin's make 480 HP and it travels comfortable at 25 to 27 mph at 3,000 rpms. The marinettes were made in Holland Michigan and were very popular on the Great Lakes. The boat is a deep V planing hull with a cabin for overnighting and the back is a hard cover with 6 ft of open fishing space at the back of the boat. I love the boat but the gas milage is 1.5 mpg so it is not something I run out to the bay often ( 60 miles) but it is very nice to run out and fish locally or a slow cruise in the evenings.   Art"
