797768,Aaron Shirley,2013-07-12 05:33:00,655,"Thanks everyone. Hopefully the salmon fishing continues to be good.  Young_One, I rely on Gamakatsu 2X strong size 1 treble for my meat rigs with 30lb Sufix fluorocarbon. I don't use the 4X because I don't want to add too much weight so I get a nice roll.  For flies (I prefer to tie my own with quality gear and make my leads the length I want), I use Gamakatsu 5/0 Octopus hook for the top hook, and 4X strong treble for bottom hook. Tied with 50lb Sufix fluorocarbon. I haven't had any issues since switching to this. I had issues with the factory packaged flies.  Good fishing!"
