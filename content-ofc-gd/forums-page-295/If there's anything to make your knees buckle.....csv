797728,Rod Caster,2013-07-11 22:45:00,5784,"yup, sweet boat. I was glued to the screen looking for that strike!"
797738,tomO,2013-07-12 00:19:00,363,"How bout a half ounce lead jig hung up 20 yards out that suddenly dislodges, flies out of the water like a bullet and hits you square between the eyes. That brought me to my knees. Right quick!"
797819,fish_finder,2013-07-12 18:21:00,370,I think these flies weigh a little more than a half ounce jig....been nailed in the front and back of the head plenty of times hucking them around.
