797489,dhickey,2013-07-10 19:47:00,1038,My daughter and I were up at 4.30 am to make the drive to meet up With life long friends and family at our camping /my fishing spot. We got there at 8.30and I set up the boat and was told to go fishing they would look after Erin. So off I went on the water. Alone  yaaaaaa. Started looking for pike but no luck I tried a few of my go to lures and nothing. Then I tried a lure that I picked up on the way and wouldn't you know it SUCCESS. The Bass were going crazy over it. All in all I landed about 30 -40 in the space of 3.5 hours. I don't  keep fish very often but Sundays breakfast was good. Saturday nite was good but the big ones didn't want to come out and play. Sunday we took the kids out.     Smores and a camp fire.    As for Ziggy RIP.  Looking forward to the August long weekend and we will do this all again. It never gets old. Don.
