795674,lew,2013-06-30 10:43:00,12766," Yeah, your right Dave, the shoulder problem is arthritis and I don't spose it's gonna go away, but poppin a bottle of Tylenol before a fishing trip seems to take the edge off.  Thanks for the comments guys, I'm looking forward to the next trip up there in August.  And Joey, Diane has received your hug and says ""your welcome"""
795679,bigbuck,2013-06-30 11:46:00,2449,"Lew , beauty 'ski buddy!! Nice markings on her."
795681,Roy,2013-06-30 12:03:00,13728,Another great fish for you Lew. Glad you and Diane had a good time up there again.

796103,Roy,2013-07-02 21:29:00,13728,I took that picture! One of the best Lew pics I have. Probably THE best. Thanks Norm!

797673,ehg,2013-07-11 16:25:00,2666,    Seems like most photos of you with a musky is something tou would see in Musky Hunter magzaine.!
797711,lew,2013-07-11 21:22:00,12766, I just wish I got paid for catching them like the Musky Hunter

795534,lew,2013-06-29 11:29:00,12766,"Mornin boyz  My wife and I got home last night from our annual June trip to Lakair on the West Arm of Nippissing and as usual, we had a great week.  Sad part is I've got a messed up shoulder so I'm kinda limited to only casting big baits for a couple hours a day but I still can't think of anywhere else I'd rather be.  The weather was great all week and the only rain we had was late last Sunday.  Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday was sunny, clear, really hot and a strong  wind from the west and I never saw a musky.  Thursday was much cooler with a cloud cover and the wind was now blowing strong from the east which I always prefer and we headed out at 8:00 AM  About an hour into the day I had a follow from a big fish but after following my figure 8 around for a couple turns she disappeared. We drifted and kept casting for another 100' or so and another pretty lady started chasing down my bait, this time much more aggressively. She followed it hard for about 4 turns on the 8 then opened up and hammered it.  It's always a blast when they hit hard right beside the boat and my partner got her in the net fast and to make things even better, the bait fell out in the net.  I seldom measure a fish and never weigh them but I'm guessing this girl is somewhere around the 50"" mark, give or take.    Yesterday was nice again with some cloud and a strong wind from the east so I headed out for a couple hours. I had another fish about the same size follow me in but didn't take the bait and then awhile later I hooked into another one but lost her after a couple strong headshakes...oh well, it happens  Anyways, that's how I spent last week and we'll be heading back up in August for another 2 weeks.  And anyone who's ever been to the West Arm has enjoyed the gorgeous sunrises.          "
795537,Rich Clemens,2013-06-29 11:50:00,3131,"Hey Lew, sorry we missed you folks this year.  Glad to see you had some action.  The temps were heating up when we left and figured you'd be in for some hot days.  That 39 I got, may have been the that followed me in about an hour or so before - in the same general area.   I hope they're still hungry in a few weeks.  Going up myself this time.   Gotta learn how to take a self pic - just in case. :-)"
795538,Rich Clemens,2013-06-29 11:53:00,3131,One of these trips - I'm gonna get me one of those 50's
795539,lew,2013-06-29 11:57:00,12766," Lots of them in there Rich, ya just gotta keep plugging away.  Sorry we missed you guys but thanks for the candies"
795540,captpierre,2013-06-29 11:58:00,2521,Nice fish Lew.  How big do they have to be before you crack a smile?
795543,lew,2013-06-29 12:08:00,12766, I'm always smiling on the inside
795545,motv8tr,2013-06-29 12:25:00,2587,"Beauty fish for sure Lew, always a nice way to spend the week..."
795546,4x4bassin,2013-06-29 12:33:00,1025,"Nice musky Lew , thanks for posting"
795548,esoxansteel,2013-06-29 13:06:00,1307,"Nice fish Lew, nothin more exciting then boatside strikes on the 8, especially watchin her for a few turns to boot. Sorry about your shoulder soldier, im sure you might just have to drop a couple of blade sizes to double 8s and youll be good to go."
795549,lew,2013-06-29 13:11:00,12766," Best part was my partner for the day had never been in a boat when a musky was caught, specially boatside on an 8, so it was really good for him."
795551,TJQ,2013-06-29 13:28:00,7806,Awesome fish Lew!!! hope your shoulder feels better!!
795553,mike rousseau,2013-06-29 13:35:00,4661,Nice fish Lew.... Sounds like a fun time
795555,Ron,2013-06-29 14:07:00,1683,"Great fish Lew! I have yet to hook into a Muskie this year. I'm having a bad year I guess.  The table will turn soon enough though, got a few destinations coming up.  Nothing beats R&R and then getting out for a couple hours of prime time fishing.  Cheers, Ron..."
795560,solopaddler,2013-06-29 14:49:00,8605,"Fish of a lifetime for most Lew, spectacular fish!"
795567,Joey,2013-06-29 15:38:00,9122,"So sorry we missed you Lew.  We waited around after we were all packed and ready, but decided the drive ahead better get under way.  Gonna miss those pickled beets  What a gorgeous fish, glad you got a nice one in the boat.  I thought about you all week in the heat and humidity, but I bet Diane made it chair in the water day every day  We will have to hook up this year.  We are going in July again as you know, but have another week planned for camping up there, so we'll try to coordinate it with the days you will be there"
795569,capt_hooked,2013-06-29 16:23:00,212,Was great to see you Lew....!  And glad you showed that boy a few tricks on musky fishing....!       But... I have not seen him since...??????  And one of my boats is missing?  Cheers....!  
795573,mattyk,2013-06-29 16:36:00,2110,"Excellent report Lew, congrats on the monster!"
795575,lew,2013-06-29 16:56:00,12766,"Thanks guys  Joey, we'll be back up August 10-24 and it'd be great to see you guys again.  Don't worry about the beets either cause Diane left a couple jars of stuff for you with Leslie for when you head up in a couple weeks.  And Kevin, sorry I corrupted your employee, but I did explain to him that musky fish'n is far more important than working"
795578,Musky or Specks,2013-06-29 18:08:00,2710,"Lew-""ah it was around a 50"" give or take"" Doesn't bother measuring-True musky veteran"
795587,Joey,2013-06-29 19:18:00,9122,"  Woohooo, please give her a big hug for me Lew, that is awesome.  I'll see if we can coordinate the same time in August for sure!!!  Gotta check with ""da boss"" at our jobs and see if it is doable"
795591,aplumma,2013-06-29 19:44:00,6896,Sorry to hear about the shoulder but glad to hear you had a good time anyway. Just so everyone knows Lew once caught a whale and we barely got a grin out of him in that picture.   Art
795594,misfish,2013-06-29 19:58:00,29133,Nice fish and smiLe Lew.LOL
795596,RangerGuy,2013-06-29 20:15:00,564,"Hey Lew,  Great report! Was hoping to get up there while u were up there. Really enjoyed our conversations last year.  Hopefully, I can make it around that time for a extended weekend :-)  Oh and awesome fish to lol!"
