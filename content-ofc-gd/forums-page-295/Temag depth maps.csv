797590,BillM,2013-07-11 02:22:00,17367,Google will be your best bet.
797603,irishfield,2013-07-11 03:58:00,26272,"Adventure fishing maps... they come laminated. http://www.adventurefishingmaps.on.ca/ You'll need two for Temagami.. same deal for Lady E depending on your plans. $9.95 each. Also probably available at ""Gramps"" Outdoor store at Angus lake, but I'd call first.. or get you order in direct to adventure now."

797693,adempsey,2013-07-11 19:03:00,1498,PM me your email if you want the PDF versions.  They are likely better quality.
797739,SirCranksalot,2013-07-12 00:22:00,3291,"Thx, FL. I was able to download PDFs for Lady E. I tried searching on that site for Lake Temag but didn't find. I didn't see how to narrow my search to just look amongst maps, or browse to find other maps. Looks like quite a useful site, though----thx for providing that link"
