797361,shimano19,2013-07-09 21:56:00,196,"hey guys, spent the day on buckhorn late with the old man and my younger brother. conditions were good, overcast with a slight chop on the water. me and my brother started out by chucking some musky lures. I was usuing a black and orange grinder spinnerbait and he was throwing a top raider in the same colour scheme. we were fishing deeper weeds in 10 fow off a point of an island and within no time were had 2 fish in the boad, 2 bad they were both two 3lb largemouth. it gave us more hope as we moved to our next location.   our next spot consisted of a weedline in 14 fow that carries into a bay, still chucking the grinder spinner bait out I hit a nice musky an hour into the morning. my brother quickly grabbed the met and we landed the first ski of the day. not a bad start.  we continued to fish the area and got another strike but missed it.  we decided we would go do some bass fishing on some thicker lilly mats with some blue and black chigger craws and a live target and spro frogs. we caught a bunch of largies ranging from 1-3lbs. not the biggest of the day but heres a pic of the old man with a decent LM   we continued our search for more musky and went to one of our locations that has always produced musky. I continued to use the black and orange grider and the hard work paid off. I hooked into a beauty 43 incher. what a great fight she put up, after a couple minutes she was in the boat, couple pictures and released.    after that musky we didn't have anymore follows or strikes, we tried other baits including double 10 cowgirls, and various crankbaits and jerkbaits. we decided to go in search of some bass. by the end we caught a few more largies but we ended up hooking into 2 nice sized walleye. 1 I got on a spinnerbait, and my dad got another on a cheap $2 that he wanted to try and caught the eye on the 1st cast.   all in all it was a good day on the water    it wasn't my brothers day for musky, mut he did a great job netting mine"

797366,wormdunker,2013-07-09 22:23:00,1711,Nice report for Buckhorn.  Those are some nice wallys!  I fished there many years ago when 5 & 6 lbers were normal catches.  We released the small guys to gain a couple of pounds.

797379,bigbuck,2013-07-09 23:31:00,2449,"Good days fishing!! Before anyone jumps down your throat, please remember that vertical holds on big fish can be just as fatal as slashing their gills. Two handed holds are much better, besides, they make small fish look bigger."

797421,Nipfisher,2013-07-10 02:42:00,2449,"Great family day on the lake. Nice way of putting it BigBuck. 2 hand holds do make the fish look bigger, especially if you hold them wayyyyyy out. lol."
797455,Lunkerhunter,2013-07-10 15:25:00,455,awesome report!  try not to hold the fish vertical. not good for the fish and will lead to lots of negative comments
