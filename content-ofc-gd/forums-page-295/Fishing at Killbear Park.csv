However, I am going camping for a few days at Killbear, for the first time, next week. I am looking for pointers for fishing the park shoreline. I am not specifically asking for spots, just would like to know that there is quality fishing to be had. I did a google search and found some posts from years ago which offered some advice. I cant exactlly go for km's worth of ""leg work"" searching tho,so any help would be awesome. Pm's are perfect too. Thank you in advance!! P.s. I will post how it goes"

Bass or pike would be likely targets.  here's an idea, especially if you have a premium site with access to the water- in busy places like that, after dark fishing can be rewarding, a worm under a glow float, a noisy crank bait or surface lure  that's all I've got, let us know how you do  oh yeah, if you don't feel like cooking, you can order a pizza delivered right to your camp site, I thought that was pretty cool"
