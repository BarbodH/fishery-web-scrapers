I know black/orange is a good color combo for all the kawartha lakes. Any certain lures that have produced for you? certain depths or areas to look for at this time of year? also where is a good place to launch on this lake?  thanks for the help  Peter"

A paved launch on that side of the lake is available at the provincial park. Muskies? The usual has always worked for me...drop offs, weed edges etc"
797741,Raycaster,2013-07-12 00:33:00,528,"Been a slow 2 weeks of fishing on Balsam this year. Nice muskie last year and the usual pike,bass and walleye but not this year. Been skunked more times than I can remember... Probably hit Buckhorn next month to hopefully change my luck. As for the muskies, just follow the thick weed beds and troll the drop offs. I've seen the muskie hunters out there still trying the usual spots.             "
