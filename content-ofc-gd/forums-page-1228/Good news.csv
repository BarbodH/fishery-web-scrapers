Formation of the Canadian Professional Anglers Association Announced  The Canadian Professional Anglers Association (CPAA) is proud to announce its formation as of April 19th, 2007.  Over 70 dedicated anglers attended the inaugural meeting at Bass Pro Shops last Thursday in a standing-room-only atmosphere, and showed overwhelming support, enthusiasm and a positive attitude towards the Association.  The CPAA consists of like-minded anglers who support and compete in multi-day, high-exposure, high-payback Pro/Am fishing events as Professional Anglers.  Members of the newly-formed Association have committed themselves to elevating the profile and exposure of both the sport of tournament bass fishing and the dedication of the Pro anglers who make the sacrifices required to compete.  In addition to promoting tournament fishing and anglers, the CPAA will promote “best practices” for fish care and the environment.  Community and children’s projects will become a focus and open the door to improving relations with all fellow users of the resource.  The CPAA’s immediate goal is to aid and support the re-establishment of a full time, televised Pro/Am bass circuit in Canada.  Members of the Association strongly believe that the Pro/Am format is essential to the growth of tournament fishing as it provides great value to the Pro’s, co-anglers, sponsors and fans.  The Canadian Professional Anglers Association was formed in order to bring tournament anglers and its partners a long needed unified voice.  Part of the CPAA’s mandate is to help its members improve themselves as fishing professionals off the water.  It will provide members with media exposure, opportunities to fish special events, education on the business side of fishing and a foundation of credibility and professionalism within the industry.  Adherence to a professional code of conduct, best of breed sportsmanship and a genuine desire to improve all aspects of the sport are requisites for prospective members to the Association.  Members will work in harmony with sponsors, manufacturers and communities to become co-beneficiaries of any CPAA action.  The Board of Directors responsible for laying the foundation for this association includes:  Chris Tieber, Mike Smith, John Noel, Edmund Wong, Charles Sim, Les Zacny and Charles Nahm  Associate Board members will include representatives from association partners.  Advisors to the board include: Tom Brooke, Wayne Izumi, Dave Mercer.  The CPAA’s website and membership application will be available on-line in the coming week.
