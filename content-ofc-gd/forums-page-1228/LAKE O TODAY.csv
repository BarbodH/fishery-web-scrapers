63398,Canuck2fan,2007-04-22 21:44:00,1444,"CC- That is awesome you caught your first smallie.... Now just imagine that smallie going 5lbs+ in some current on light tackle and you get an idea of what all the excitement is about with them.  Sorry to hear the tribs are/were dead on Lake O. I went to one on Lake Huron and had my best morning there ever. I went 2/3 on rainbow, and didn't even feed one sucker any of my roe LOL."
