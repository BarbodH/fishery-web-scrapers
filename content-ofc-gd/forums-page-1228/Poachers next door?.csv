63753,Terry,2007-04-23 17:06:00,14456,"if it's legal..then it's right for them the law and personal morals have nothing to do with one another and I don't think they should be discussed in the same threads....as the law is the law and morals are what you believe in, what you find OK,  not what is the law  so hate the law not the guy fish/hunting/getting food within the law so change the law.....IMO"
63767,Fisherpete,2007-04-23 17:36:00,1814,"Wow, tough call, but I think I would have done the same thing in that situaution. To me, the compassion aspect would not really have been the deciding factor. By the time you saw that fish, it was already dead, and hopefully you giving the lecture to the son will have impacted his future behaviour.  Now, If I was out on the lake, and I saw my neighbour (or anyone else for that matter) with an OOS fish in his pail/livewell, and that fish still had a chance to live, I would not have been so forgiving... explain the regs, ask nicely for the fish to be returned, and then out comes the cellphone...  I have had NUMEROUS instances on Rice Lake and Simcoe where I have had to advise shore fishermen that the fish in that pail better go back or else the authorities will be called. They always claim ""Oh, I didn't know it was OOS"" but ignorance is no excuse. You have to know the regs or don't put out a line!"
63768,Wes Bender,2007-04-23 17:38:00,105,"I totally don’t think it is right. There are seasons for a reason to preserve the resource. If they want to take more than the daily limit then so be it, that’s their ‘Right’. But they should still have to obey the seasons. I later found out that a person can go to the reserve and buy a 20 lb bag of walleye fillets. A fishing buddy of mine told me he bought some. I gave him heck too. He is responsible for creating the flippin demand. A few days later I was talking with a CO about the issue and trying to find out what actions were taken on the incident I reported. He had no details but gave me a bunch of numbers to try. He mentioned that a bunch of calls came in a few days before mine about some people camped out under the bridge with a deep freezer and a generator. The freezer was full of walleye. What the @!#&@! How much fish does one need? Unless, they are selling it. They were 'legal' so nothing was done.  Niagara earlier in this thread made the comment, ""they do it once and get away with it... they will do it again over and over..."" How true it is. I understand that it was a pretty awkward situation for Pigeontroller to be in, Call the hotline or not. Me, I hate my neighbours so I would have turned them in. Those sots put 1 too many bags of garbage out on garbage day, and my fingers are on the dialer..hahaha I can’t say yeah or niegh on Pigeontroller’s decision. But he at least let the guy know that he didn’t approve and reminded him of the legality of the situation. Good on ya!"
63869,Big Cliff,2007-04-23 21:37:00,6899,"Your decision was based on compassion, good for you! I probably would have done the same thing although I might have added the warning that if it happened again I would feel obligated to advise the MNR.  I think you made the right call under the circumstances."
63884,Roy,2007-04-23 21:56:00,13728,"You called it as you saw it on the spur of the moment and you did right IMO. Pigeon Fisher, very good post."
63990,kennyman,2007-04-24 01:47:00,737,"Terry, I never said I was hating anybody. That's out of your mouth,not mine.  I never said I like it either. Also my morals have everything to do with my opinion. Sorry, but this is a FORUM, not a court. I thought this was about discussing our opinions Terry? I'm sorry if you don't like my opinion.  More about the incident my customer was obviously disturbed my. He is a farmer,hunter and fisherman and loves the sport. He has seen it happen over and over, can do nothing and was frustrated. We get along well,so we were talking about it. Discussing OUR opinions. Apparently they had gutted a bunch of them for their eggs and just left thrown on shore. All I'm saying is although that may be the letter of the law,I'm sure it wasn't the original intent of the law. By the way I have alot of native customers and I would say as a rule that most respect nature or are at least much more aware of it than my average customer. Most would be appalled at the waste. Most are very respectful of their enviroment and nature. A few however take whatever they can get with no care for the consequences and can only see dollar signs. This in my opinion is wrong. I'm sorry if you think it's off topic Terry but to me they are very similar with the same consequences to the enviroment and fishery ........ just one is called legal, which to me is unbelievable. Wrong is wrong no matter who is doing it."
63704,Wes Bender,2007-04-23 15:02:00,105,"I have a similar but different story. I was steelhead fishing in a river that has a spring walleye run as well. That day the walleye were in there thick. I could not get a drift without hooking a walleye. They were bumping into my legs as they were swimming up stream. A school of 20 or 30 ten pounder was right in front of me. It was a nice sight to see. Then I saw the pile of guts on the shore. All the fish were over 8 lbs each. That really got my blood boiling. Walleye season was closed. It became evident that I was not going to get a drift by these fish target only steelhead so I decided to pick up and head to another river. There were a few others fishing down stream from me. I was watching then catching walleye after walleye. So I decide to stick my nose in. I made my way down stream and proceeded to make idol poop chat. Then I noticed one dude clean fish in the back. I asked them if those were walleye and they said yes. I fricken snapped and said, what the @#&@, it is not in season and they are fricken spawning. They the guy cleaning piped up. ""Not for me it's not"". As it turned out the guy claimed he was 'First Nations' so he didn't need a fishing license or have to follow the rules and seasons. I called the hotline when I got back to the truck. So on my way down the highway I passed an OPP. So I made a quick U-Turn and went back to chat with her. I explained to her what was going on and I informed her that I just made a call to the MNR hotline. The cop then promptly made haste for the river to make the bust. The MNR called me back about 5 minutes later to make certain that I was sure this guy was not 'First Nations' before they dispatch a CO to the river. I don't really know how to put this without sounding like a racist but he looked as white as the next guy. I am not racist and I hope I don't offend anyone. But this guy did not look 'First Nations'. Apparently the MNR receives a lot of calls to this same river with people potentially poaching walleye. The poachers are from a near by reserve, and technically are not poaching. Who do you think are the first to whine about the declining walleye population in the Black Bay of Lake Superior? This brings up a whole other issue and argument not meant for this forum, but I thought I would share my story and the outcome."
63705,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-23 15:07:00,4399,"Hey Dax it`s easy for someone to criticise and say you should have reported them but they don`t have to live next door and put up with the possible Bull that could result now if this keeps happening then that is different and they should be reported, I know I would not have a problem reporting a repeat offender and I don`t think you would either."
63706,pigeonfisher,2007-04-23 15:15:00,696,"It is our human nature to judge others by that persons behaviour, while expecting others to judge us by our intent.   (Unfortunately we all, Myself included, make these judgements.  Often on a daily basis.  We can only endeavor to be better and know that we have made an error in judgement, then not make the same error again and again and again and again.)  Keep this in mind at ALL TIMES.  We may see someone act in a way that seems deliberate, or even malicious towards another person or species.  We don't know the intent of the action.  Prior to judging allow them the opportunity to express that.  In some cases this doesn't bare weight.  ie. the gentleman fishing out of St. Clair last year with 8 rods for two guys.  It is quite clear the intention was to catch fish by any means necessary, even while breaking the law.  I think you made the right call."
63709,OhioFisherman,2007-04-23 15:28:00,6623,"A former friend of my dads got busted with 27 northern pike with another guy up there. Dude had been going up north a long time and knew the rules. The went to the same area we did, but never stayed at the same resort.  Former friend, dad viewed them just like thieves, they were stealing. It`s one thing to make a mistake, but when you know and can`t be trusted?"
63751,kennyman,2007-04-23 17:00:00,737,"I just got through talking with a customer that just had a similar experience with some spawning trout and him seeing ""them"" crossbowing and reeling in all they could take. Not exactly respecting and preserving the land is it? I guess it's legal, but is it right?"
