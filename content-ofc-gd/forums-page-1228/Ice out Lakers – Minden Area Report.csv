Water temps were between 39-41 deg F at surface. We trolled, casted and drop shotted. We used spoons, body baits and minnows. It turned out to be a great day of boating, but a lousy day of fishing. We spoke with a few others that had about the same luck. A friend said he only caught a few incidental bass in 25-50 fow at Minerâ€™s Bay. Met another guy in Norland that had no luck at another local lake.  I should also add that all the lakes we saw had completely cleared of ice by about 1pm yesterday."
