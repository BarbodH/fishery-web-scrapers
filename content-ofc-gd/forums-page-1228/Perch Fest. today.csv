64246,b2kptbo,2007-04-24 22:50:00,1505,"Hooked up with a couple buddies and did some perching. Nice weather, a good number of boats out but not crowded. On the water about 10:00 and fished till about 2:00, jigging wasn't the greatest and we had the best luck with pickeral rigs (Lotta doubles). Not too many jumbos and put back a lot small ones, but kept enough for a good feed. We did OK and had a good time...   Biggest I got 11ins. "
