When I downsize pictures I set the resolution/quality level to about mid scale. It takes 2 or 3 meg pictures and converts them to about 35kb.  I use paint shop pro. After you downsize your pictures pixel size and then you click ""save as""...the box that comes up for where to save it to has ""options"" in the bottom corner. Click that and set your compression percentage lower. I'm using 60%."
