Anyway, it appears that the plastic nut that holds the livewell pump to the hull either failed or came undone because that is gone which let the pressure of the water force the pump back inside the hull, no plug I had in the boat would have fit in that hole although in a pinch I'm sure I'd have foind something to slow it down.  Enthropy; Sturgeon lake in the Kawarthas and there weren't many other boats around if I'd had to bail out.  Just ordered a new pump and should have it in by Friday.  Glad to hear others are checking theirs before heading out, it is one of the few things I would think to check normally."
