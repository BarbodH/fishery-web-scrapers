63912,Mark Kulik,2007-04-23 22:47:00,348,"Just returned from Windor Ont. Fishing the Detroit River with Mr. Walleye Bob Devine from Chartertalk guiding and fellow Team X member , all I can say is WOW!!! what a fishery, Bob put Karl Kalonka and I onto some real good ones my biggest was over 8 lbs. with a real good average size, I caught more in a day and a half than I had all last season, we filmed the outing for an 2008 Extreme Angler episode, it's gonna make some great viewing, anyone looking to catch walleyes and improve there skills should definetly give Bob a call! can't wait for the next trip west!"
63923,GbayGiant,2007-04-23 23:21:00,1780,No pics ? Quit teasing us.
63925,Mark Kulik,2007-04-23 23:28:00,348,"Hi John Bob is supposed to email me a couple of pics of our bigger fish, hopefully I get them soon.  Mark"
63929,FinS,2007-04-23 23:31:00,463,it sure is a walleye factory mark
64005,Bob Devine,2007-04-24 02:28:00,251,"Thanks for the kind words Mark. It helps that you are one heck of a stick! I should have known when we hit the smallies on Simcoe that you would be on fish, but 2 minutes in and you and K-Dawg hooking a double header was a pleasant surprize. Timing is everything and the weather and walleyes cooperated with us. I also want to say thanks to Ken Masse who ran my boat as the camera boat. "
64006,Bob Devine,2007-04-24 02:31:00,251,Here is a picture of Mark Kuliks boat that we were fishing in on Sunday on the Detroit River. 
64017,GbayGiant,2007-04-24 03:06:00,1780,Nice fish guys.  Mark are you sponsored by Hooters to or was that sticker a personal touch on the boat ?   I like the bass paint job.
64044,Mark Kulik,2007-04-24 09:44:00,348,"Hi John, I was sposored last year by Hooters in Barrie, when the manager I was dealing with left, I didn't pursue it , but I think I will this year, and yes I like the look of the logo too, LOL"
