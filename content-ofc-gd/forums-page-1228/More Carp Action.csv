63850,dsn,2007-04-23 21:01:00,1018,The big fish moved out today. Only found the small ones that I can lip. Never caught such a small carp in my life ever. I'm used to the 17+.

64126,MJL,2007-04-24 15:02:00,2427,Here's one of my smaller ones.  It's about the same length as a Kleenex box.  It's the smallest mirror I've ever caught.  
64137,Victor,2007-04-24 15:31:00,1609,i forgot about it when i got home last night lol ... now you'll have to wait till tonight  just for reference ... i think alot of the crappie caught at the opener this weekend will be bigger than my carp haha
