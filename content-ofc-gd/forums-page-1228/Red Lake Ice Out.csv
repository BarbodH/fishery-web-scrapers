56559,John Glynn,2007-04-07 17:58:00,25,Hey Guys. How does it look this year for Ice out in the Red Lake area? Will it be as early as last year?  Thanks  John
56562,irishfield,2007-04-07 18:22:00,26272,There are many guys here that are sure hoping so!!!!
56598,MuskiesnLakers,2007-04-07 20:38:00,6,"I would have said an early ice-out, but with the turn back to cold, I would say that it still has a chance to be a normal ice-out time, but expect it to be more on the late side than early.  It's supposed to start warming up again this week (although with lows in the -teens).  If it turns warm after next week, it could still be normal, but if it stays cool, I'd bet on a late ice out.  I'm out in Winnipeg, and have been dying to get at 'er, so I've been watching the conditions religiously of late.  (Not for Red Lake, though... I want to get going SOONER than that  )"

I want it to break up 2 or 3 days before I arrive.  Let the fishing begin.  A day or two I posted some ice pictures for the Red Lake area from back in 2002.  I'll try to bump the thread to the front page."
56655,John Glynn,2007-04-07 23:11:00,25,Actually I was more interested in the Red Lake area as I will be on Little Vermillion on June 8th. I was hoping for a normal/later Ice out. But we will see. I still hope it works out OK for you Connie when you get there.
58798,John Glynn,2007-04-11 22:39:00,25,How is it looking guys?
59950,irishfield,2007-04-14 19:29:00,26272,"As of yesterday...still 30"" of ice on a Northern Minnesota Lake. Not sure if they were on Vermilion or not. They usually go in close to there though..  "
60003,tjsa,2007-04-14 23:14:00,1578,"I expect ice out will be around the 2nd weekend of may, if the temps stay up. If we ever get any rain of any significance, it will be sooner. Right now, the ice is only evaporating, and guys are still driving on lakes up here."
60086,grt1,2007-04-15 03:50:00,638,"There is still 3 feet of ice and no water on top of it. with the warm temps expected, next week I hope to see some water in the creeks flowing into the lake and starting the melting process."

64051,grt1,2007-04-24 11:08:00,638,"On Gullrock, just south of Red Lake, the shoreline has water between the ice and the shore and Bug River is open to the entrance to the Lake. Red Lake is usually a week behind Gullrock in opening and if we keep getting the warm temperatures I think Gullrock will be open within the next 2 weeks."
