64037,Beans,2007-04-24 05:32:00,3339,  seems to be working ok Jack but it took about 15 minutes to upload...very slow.  Did you resize your picture before trying to post...anything bigger than 640 x 480 will take even longer?
64049,Roy,2007-04-24 11:04:00,13728,Nice pic....no fishing rods?
64052,Terry,2007-04-24 11:19:00,14456,isn't that a rod in his left hand
64055,Roy,2007-04-24 11:32:00,13728,Yeah   you got'er Hawkeye....
64069,Mike the Pike,2007-04-24 12:34:00,3421,Roy when looking at these pictures you must look higher up
64093,Nanook,2007-04-24 13:38:00,565," Thanks Beans; Looks like that pic. was taken 10yrs ago LOL!!!  I do get as far as the 'Upload' initiated,but its never taken this long,Ive  waited 'bout 10mins, than give up. I downsize all my pics to 500 x ? so size isnt a problem.  As you  know I,m a KLUTZ on these puters,but have posted pics before, but its got me beat this time.........about ready to call it quits, I dont need THIS frustration.  Thanks again !!!!"
64101,Beans,2007-04-24 14:00:00,3339,"Summer of '04...  To tell the truth Jack, if this site is taking a while to upload photos, I just let it run and go to a different site...ie. Bill Dance Outdoors...LOL  Like I said, it took 15 minutes to upload and there were only 23 members on board at 12:30 AM...  My guess is that Rick was mucking things up making improvements...He likes to play games with us old folks' minds...LOL"
