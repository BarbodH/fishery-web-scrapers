It also afforded me an opportunity to a shake-down trip of Superdad for the 2007 fishing season.  We never though for an instance that the day would be a day to remember.  The boat had just come out of the shop (MP Marine) and all tuned and ready to go.  We headed for Wellington from Bayview at 0430 on Monday and after breakfast at Timmies in Picton, made our way to the launch ramps in Wellington. The ramp next to the LCBO is usable as it has the floating docks chained to the main dock. The other launch ramp past the beach doesn't have the dock in, so we were unable to use it and used the LCBO ramp.  Parking up the street was ok.  Launched and headed out the little channel and headed for Sandbanks shores.  We trolled a quick pass at West Point but had no results. Headed off to another area and began to troll in earnest. We were trolling in 4 feet of water with 75foot leads behind the boards and we were hitting the bottom a lot. We shortened the leads to 60 feet and found success on the outside boards.  Then we decided to troll in 6 feet of water and the Fish Gods smiled on us.  We fished from  0715 to 1430 and made approx 7 passes along the shore(each taking 1/2 hr to 45 mins) and here's what we did.  We landed 14 brown trout and lost two at the net. The biggest was one that I landed at 6.75 lbs, the rest ranged from 15"" to 19"" (1.5 lbs to 3 lbs).  All fish were caught on Alpena Diamonds - you know the ones that were discontinuted about 10 years ago...........  Here are a couple shots of the results.    And Laker John's Pair    The results were outstanding and we couldn't believe we were able to get the fish all day long, we had thought the morning and evening would be the times to be on the water.  We have to thanks Capt' Steve from Lake Ontario United for the advice that he had on his Fishing Board. The water temp and trolling speed was perfect.  To sum the day up, we had a day like none other (for Brown Trout) and may never experience that sort of a day again."
