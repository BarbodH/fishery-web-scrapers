63664,Terry,2007-04-23 13:54:00,14456,that does look pretty good
63684,tonyb,2007-04-23 14:30:00,1637,"Thanks for posting the pics David, that is what I am talking about.  People should realize the quality of the units before dismissing the idea of side imaging.  I blame the manufaturers for not putting out such a clear message.  This technology is priced at a premium eliminating a vast portion of the market.  In time, expect to see this technology become more affordable, it is good to know that there are actual improvements beyond 'color' in a sonar unit.  Tony"
63746,SHAD,2007-04-23 16:51:00,134,I think it is a great tool.  Alot of people are really narrow minded Sonny and intimidated by something different that aren't not familiar with.   Good for you for having the ballz to try something you think will give u an advantage.  As the sayings go; can't teach an old dog new tricks and 90% of the fish are caught by 10% of the fisherman
63755,Terry,2007-04-23 17:08:00,14456,have you seen the price...this old dog needs a second job to buy one
63954,sonny,2007-04-24 00:16:00,511,"see thats what i""m talkin about,,,thanks for posting the pics,,,totally different the the old side finding technology,,,it may not catch teh fish for you but like the rest of the sonar it gives you an idea where to fish,,,and anouther thing that i learned is when you use it with the gps you can actually mark a waypoint spot that may be 300 feet or more from your boat and go back and fish it...It's just anouther tool in the arsonal of fishing.I just want people to understand it as i was confused about it at the beginning also,,but cofusion turned to excitement the more i learned!!"
63974,young_one,2007-04-24 00:50:00,620,"Deciding a lake for panfish opener this weeknd. Simcoe...Kawartha? With my newl boat and 997si, hopefully my success would be greater. I'll definitely use a lot of my 997si, and it'll be my first time experience on the water. Be sure to check out my report next week."
64043,LipDip,2007-04-24 09:42:00,39,"The market for stuff like this never shrinks or disapears. People are always willing to buy it and use it. I catch just as many fish with the $185 Fishmark as with the $1000 x15 and sometimes with no graph at all. Don't confuse price, features, demand or hype with the actual need for something. It's an easy mistake to make."
64081,tonyb,2007-04-24 13:12:00,1637,"LipDip, a quality sonar is an absolute must if you want to consistently be successful fishing deep or large expanses of open water.  Certain types of fishing don't require a sonar (eg. bass fishing in summer) but for big water salmon, trout, walleye, etc you will have less success without a sonar, gauranteed.  I think you meant to say don't confuse fishing tools with gadgets  Quality sonar units are tools, this is a gadget...    Tony"
64089,Terry,2007-04-24 13:31:00,14456,"IMHO no I think he meant what he said... LipDip is a great fisherman, guide, educator of fishing and writer so for him, his statement is true but I think that learning how to read a good sonar can sure cut down on the learning curve but learning to read the lake will make you a better fisherman  but I have to say that my new  $509.00 X15 showed me things and help me find fish that took me hours to find in the past  I fish an area where fish can be in 9 ft of water but they are always on the move and trolling seems to be the only way to find them then you can sit and jig or crank for them...with the X15 I can see fish on the bottom in 9ft of water while trolling ( the first fishfinder I ever had that show so much detail) so even if then are not bitting I can see they are there and stop and fish them slow with plastic or live bait...without the X15 quality I keep trolling till they get active or just  guess where they are today...."
64094,David Chong,2007-04-24 13:42:00,836,"Humminbird actually has a few units that offer this technology. The most economical being the 797c2 SI at about $1200 yes, it is not cheap and yes, it is just a tool but what a tool! SET HARD! SET OFTEN! Dave"
62014,TJQ,2007-04-19 02:53:00,7806,Did anyone see the recent ads for the fishifinders that look sidways...  i though the underwater boat and bridge were cool.. any applications in fishing??
62016,Roy,2007-04-19 02:54:00,13728,Gimmick...don't go there.
62020,vance,2007-04-19 03:00:00,719,"Had a side finder on my last fish finder it was a nice GIMMICK but spent more time screwing around with it than anything and it never did get me on to any fish,but then again most fish are smarter than  me   vance"
62021,tjsa,2007-04-19 03:02:00,1578,"I thought you were gone north, whut up wit dat??  Yes, I have seen that stuff, looks interesting, but way out of my budget."
62024,bucktail,2007-04-19 03:05:00,1857,Good if your a diver I bet!
62025,sonny,2007-04-19 03:06:00,511,"Actually it's not a gimmic,,,i recently purchased one myself and had it out for the first time last saturday,,,i must admit it takes a little understanding of how it work and what your  looking at considering all we have been looking at for years was just what was under the boat streight down,,this technology has beeen in the making for some years and almost every manufaturer of sonars has r&d working on it,,just humminbird has come out with it first is all,,,,Anyway i have found a few sites to get information  from,,,one is just new started the other day,,  http://www.xumba.scholleco.com/  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sideimaging/   whether ya like it or not,,,technology stops for no man!!  ohh ya side finder and side imaging,,,,,,not the same!"
62038,Roy,2007-04-19 03:33:00,13728,Humminbird.......that says it all. Think about it for a minute.
62468,sonny,2007-04-20 00:49:00,511,Humminbird has come a long way since the early days!!!top quality and durable now!
62478,taper,2007-04-20 01:01:00,611,Couldn't pay me enough to buy a humminbird  yet. Even if it was Lowrance I wouldn't go there for a couple years till they work out all the bugs.
62483,lunkerbasshunter,2007-04-20 01:05:00,2585,"its true, i here this is the next big thing in the fishing industry.  the manufacturers are expecting this to be huge for them.  CHeers!"
62488,sonny,2007-04-20 01:10:00,511,"hey taper,,,tachnology may be news to us,,,but they have been working on this for a few years now,,,over five anyway!"
62535,tschirk,2007-04-20 02:07:00,261,"I'm usually the 1st to buy something like this and I did give it serious thought, but when I considered that no one except Humminbird is selling a consumer version, I decided to wait until names like Lowrance & Garmin get into the game. While the sidescan is not new in comercial markets, I don't trust 1st generation consumer technology especially from someone like Humminbird. Cheers, T"
62538,fliptheslop,2007-04-20 02:13:00,112,"This is not as new as you may think its been around for a few years now, and like all electronics ifyou know how to use it nothing is better, I know guys who have had them for a couple of years now and wouldnt be with out them, shows you the bottom of a lake like you have never or could ever with a conventional graph, not for everyone because of cost,but if you tourny fish alot you can bet it puts you at a disavantage to those that do have it"
62547,Cast-Away,2007-04-20 02:20:00,790,I'm with you Taper. I could never get mine to work at speeds over 15MPH with the flat bottom transducer that they sell with the Humminbirds
62552,sonny,2007-04-20 02:25:00,511,"hmm had mine working fine on my boat at top speed,,,50kph,,,never skipped a beat"
62616,Greencoachdog,2007-04-20 08:44:00,8163,  Thought about it... and realized that anybody that owns a tiller doesn't need to be knockin' a Humminbird.
62625,Roy,2007-04-20 10:39:00,13728,"Took you long enough, Dawg."
62626,Greencoachdog,2007-04-20 10:46:00,8163,"  Well you said ""think about it""!"
62648,Raf,2007-04-20 12:55:00,3495,bottomline has been making side finders for years.
62650,tonyb,2007-04-20 13:03:00,1637,"I am surprised at all the Lowrance loyal folks here.  In my opinion, Lowrance has been riding their reputation for too long while other companies are pushing the envelope when it comes to technology and a quality product.  If you seriously compare the colour sonars from Lowrance to Humminbird you will see a CLEAR difference, Humminbird coming out on top.  Humminbird is innovating while others are contemplating, kudos to them.  My next sonar purchase will be a Humminbird, but I haven't decided if I will go the SI route or not yet, it is a very nice unit.  If you are near Tall Tales Bait and Tackle in Cambridge, stop in and talk to Pat about the Side Imaging technology and he can give you some great information as he is actually using the technology.  Cheers, Tony   Tony"
62656,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-20 13:12:00,0,"Man my first or second boat back in the 90's had a side finder. I don't think it's anything new and probably just as bad.  Lowrance has a reputation because every year they keep coming out with new and improved products. I don't even need to look at any other companies, Lowrance has it all and I'm not worried about the quality."
62698,David Chong,2007-04-20 15:17:00,836,"Humminbird has come a long way from the early days. I've personally used a Side Imaging Humminbird since 2005 and it is a fantastic tool! It cuts down the amount of time looking for insolated cover, it works in shallow and deep water. The imaging is unbelievable I'll see if I can get a image of a wreck on Lake Erie from Derek Strub to post. But like everything else it is only a tool much like your sonar, you still have to catch the fish!  Dave"
62825,easton13th,2007-04-20 22:56:00,371,"Was out with Sonny today on Lake Ontario. Side Imaging is pretty impressive. Worked fine. Once you get used to what you are looking at it, it actually shows things you might not know was there. Not 100% sure on the brands, the competition and or the technology BUT from what I have seen I am impressed.  Easton"
62873,sonny,2007-04-21 00:51:00,511,"well said tony  Had the boat out today on lake ontario,,,and although the lake is mostly flat the sonar did well and really neat to watch!!,,,not to many people catching alot considering we got out a lttle late around 830...but what a beatifull day!"
63661,David Chong,2007-04-23 13:51:00,836,Today's Side Imaging from Humminbird is totally different from previous Side Finder units! Please check out these images that were taken by Derek Strub!
