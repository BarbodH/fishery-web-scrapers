64396,aniceguy,2007-04-25 01:42:00,1094,"so I finally took the road trip I had in the plan for a month or so. some of the finest scenery I have seen in a long time and I can now add a new river to my "" hard fishing fish "" catagory, there is nothing like looking into a pool seeing fish, thinking its only 6 feet deep tops only to drop the fishing rod down and realize the 13 footer is almost under water and your no where near the bottom....... some scenery and 1 of the many bullets from this epic trip  A priceless weekend with less then 8 hrs of sleep from Friday through Monday and of course finding the mother load of smelt  A few of the hundred pictures of fish and scenery       and of course the reason for the trip...........timing couldnt have been much better on these.......with a fantastic push of bright dime fish "
