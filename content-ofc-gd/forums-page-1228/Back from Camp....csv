64328,TJQ,2007-04-25 00:32:00,7806,"Finally got up to camp for 4 glorious days of needed R & R....  a bit surprised however at how much snow and ice the still is up north...  same spots on the trail in still had a couple of feet on them.. there were alot of spots we had to winch the bike through...    This feller was feeding on willow buds... didnt seem to mind us at all...  (see you in  september...)    When we got to camp we discovered that most of our portion of the river was still frozen...    The ice by shore was still a foot thick!!    The trick now was figuring how we were gonna fish that!!    It took a couple of hours but we got the camp put back up.    And we put the NEW wood stove in.    The evening sunset....  what a beautiful day.. some sun for a change!    The next day we went out for a bit of fishing.    Heres some nice scenery shots along the river.      A view of the camp from the river.       Heres something I've never done before....       Even the beavers were out getting busy!       The we did a little ice breaking...    Poor mans waders.... lol...  got a bit slushy on that ice.    Hard to troll....     One last bird pix on the way out today...    Unfortunately the ice kept us from fishing much and we never even got a bite... must be a pre-spawn thing...  anyway, we did catch a Lynx sleeping on the side of the trail.. and we got to watch him for a bit......"
64335,Daplumma,2007-04-25 00:37:00,1961,Beautiful shots there TJ.Did you run the boat up on the ice at full throttle? Joe
64336,irishfield,2007-04-25 00:37:00,26272,Now I know where Geerty went. My bird's missing !  Looked like a great weekend away TJ. Nobody messed with your stuff over the winter?
64339,TJQ,2007-04-25 00:39:00,7806,"No... I hadnt been back up there since Mid October, and I had tore everything down and tarped it up.. everything was just as I left it...  a few extra mouse poops though..."
64341,irishfield,2007-04-25 00:42:00,26272,Good to hear. Guess once it's covered with snow it's hidden and maybe you're off the sled trail enough?
64342,solopaddler,2007-04-25 00:43:00,8605,Excellent report and pic's! (please disregard my pm where I asked you what the snow/ice conditions are like up there  )

64494,TJQ,2007-04-25 12:27:00,7806,"Thnaks guys/girls...  There were mosquitoes out... second time I have seen them out with ice still present... no blackflies, and Im not allowed to bring the tutu when going for more than two nites... leads to temptation.. im quite pretty in it... lol..  Ya after we left last year, im sure no one was coming down the river and we hid the entrance to the trail to it pretty good...  its too bad ya have to do things like that to keep people form ripping ypu off..."
64499,Terry,2007-04-25 12:33:00,14456,you do have a little piece of heaven there
64502,Smokey,2007-04-25 12:37:00,1278,Nice pics TJ. Should be a great summer up there for you as you all settled in now. Looking forward to the next report.
64512,OhioFisherman,2007-04-25 12:58:00,6623,"Great pictures! The snow and ice makes it easier to see the wabbit tracks. Guess there are rednecks that far north, no pickup to stand in so the boat had to do? LOL"
64519,misfish,2007-04-25 13:11:00,29133,"Real nice pic,s TJ. Those birds look pretty tasty from here.LOL"
