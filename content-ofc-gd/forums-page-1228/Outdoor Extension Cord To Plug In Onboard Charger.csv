It has a maintainance/float feature where it will float the battery charge to keep it ready for fishing.  From my cottage to the boat lift & dock, there is about 150 ft. so I'll need to get a extension cord to plug in the charger. Since I'll be leaving it outside 24/7, what type of extension cord do I need? Do I just use the same ones that I use for the garden electronics or do I need a special type to withstand UV, water and etc?  What do you boat owners use?"

63814,Fisherman,2007-04-23 19:08:00,7201,"Okay, I'll agree with going with the outdoor weatherproof box, somewhere close to your dock, however, a 12 ga. extension cord from there to the boat is mega overkill.  When going from 120V to 12V, you only need 1/10 the amps at 120V AC to provide that current at 12V DC.   In other words, a 12V 10 amp charger only takes 1 amp at 120V AC.  Even a two bank charger might approach 3 amps at 120V AC."

It even went as far as to say that if there is damage to the charger because of the use of an inadequate extension cord, the warranty is void.  I managed to find a 100' 10 gauge at Home Depot for about a $1/foot. Bright yellow.  Don't know if they had a 150' 8 gauge though."
