63567,jediangler,2007-04-23 03:59:00,1923,"Went down to Snider's flats by the Grand river to try out my kayak and several new upgrades that I've added since last year. I put larger wheels on my kayak cart which made the 1km walk from the car to the ponds a breeze. I fished for 2hrs from 1pm - 3pm for crappie with a small jig before I got a hit. When I set the hook I knew I didn't have a crappie on. It dogged down deep and pulled me around for ten minutes before I could get it to the surface. That's when I found I had tail hooked a 31"" carp. I landed it and needed the pliers to get the hook out. I then used my new camera mount to take a pic before releasing it back unharmed. I estimated it somewhere between 12-15lbs. Maybe some experienced carp guys can make a more accurate guess.    I had a blast with this fish and may consider trying for carp again from the yak."
63568,GbayGiant,2007-04-23 04:08:00,1780,"Haha, I can picture it pulling you around in the kayak.  Nice looking carp, if that's possible."

63829,gforce,2007-04-23 20:24:00,63,I remember hooking a carp by the tail.  It took off like a train and I watched my line scream.  Finally cranked down the drag and hauled it in.  An amazing fight!
63895,JEREMY,2007-04-23 22:09:00,300,NIce fish and set up on the yak jedi.
64026,jediangler,2007-04-24 03:29:00,1923,"Thanks all. That really was as much fun as I've had in the kayak.  Roy all you have to do is ask my wife, she'll tell you how childish I can be.  TbayBoy there's nothing like kayak fishing. If you get a chance, give it a try. It's like wearing a pair of chest waders that go in all depths of water.  bookoobeast when I get out again I'll take some pics of the camera mount. It is made up of hockey sticks a peanut butter jar and parts of two different tripods.  Also I was using the new Fireline Crystal line and really liked it, very sensative and strong. I was using 10lb test that has 4lb diameter."
