441355,irishfield,2010-03-08 13:57:00,26272," The only way it will help Chris.. if you lease or buy your vehicles under the business you'll be able to claim the PST portion now on your, I suspect quarterly, remittance form... instead of just losing it off your year end books profits. Same with other taxed items that are consumables (and not resale items that are tax exempt) under the old system."
441357,Dara,2010-03-08 14:10:00,3052," I wasn't serious about it, but Anything that you buy and pay PST on, you will not be paying it any more..you get it all back same as GST.  Lets face it, Dalton is taxing us to death and screwing up big time with his stupid save the planet windmills and solar power. He is doing nothing for the natural resources industry. Mining and logging is dieing and all he cares about is his golden triangle"
441366,JohnF,2010-03-08 14:41:00,3494,I've attended presentations by John Wilkinson (he's a local guy) and spoken by phone at length with one of his department people and I remain convinced that it will be detrimental to my business (real estate). The average home buyer/seller is going to get nicked pretty good. I appreciate there are potentially some benefits for certain businesses but my jury is still out as to whether or not the net effect will be good for Ontarians generally.  There was initially some talk about it being imposed by the feds with a threat that provincial transfer payments would be adversely affected but that talk suddenly died off. I suspect the difference in partisan power between the federal govt and the Ontario govt came into play there somewhere. I'd really be interested in seeing how this would play out if there was no partisan in politics.  JF
441422,ch312,2010-03-08 18:06:00,1590,"  ummmm...are you sure ""dalton"" and ""good job"" belong in the same sentence?    more taxes dont help any of us normal joe's. its really that simple.  i'll be buying even more stuff out of province and country after this Bull hst comes into effect. the ontario government can stick it where the sun doesnt shine and im going to avoid paying taxes any way possible. im sure others will follow suit.  i know that isnt the way i should think and quite honestly i dont like it. i wouldnt have a problem with paying more taxes if the money stayed in our country and helped our own or they actually spent it wisely...  -immigrants getting financial assistance while our own are homeless -donating money to other countries when we could use it for healthcare, education, and fixing roads -people abusing the welfare and child support systems when that money could be used for getting children into sports -handouts in the millions to specific groups sure makes me smile too"
441501,Jigger,2010-03-08 22:34:00,1237,"I'm no economist. In fact I'm not very prudent when it comes to money in the first place. Thats what my better half is for  . But all things considered, the GST was ripped on because it taxed everything. Guess what? That, economically, is sound thinking and gets peoples goat because they can't escape it. I believe the GST is a major reason why Canada is still treading water while many of the worlds economies stumble. Instead of cutting the GST, I think Harper/Flaherty should have cut some personal income tax.  The HST is just another one of these taxes that hits eveyone. End of the line. Pay tax. You can't escape it. I'm really not looking forward to paying extra at each corner. Who would? But I think it may be a stepping stone to a resurgent Ontario, and as a tradesman, I can only hope the province starts pushing work pronto. Dalton could have at least made it a more palateable 10% and the fact that he pushed it through as fast as he did doesn't sit well. But end of use taxes get everyone and for a gov't thats an ideal scenario. I'd also be interested in some substantial tax cuts here in ON as well.  I really do hope it benefits you guys and gals who are owner operators.  Again, I'm no economist and Feel free to steer me in the right direction if I'm offbase."
441675,John Bacon,2010-03-09 04:25:00,3277, The fact that not all provinces are adopting HST puts a pretty big hole in any claims that the federal goverment is forcing Ontario to do this.  Saskatawan and Manitoba will still have their own PST seperate from GST or HST after July.

440867,canuckjack,2010-03-07 03:36:00,121," That site looks like a sorry attempt to polish a steaming pile...  Why can't politicians just be honest and say ""we're increasing your taxes"" instead of hiding behind all the crap.  Is anybody actually buying the line that this is actually going to be beneficial and we'll all come out a head?  This sentence is a perfect example ""The RST rate on transient accommodation, such as hotel rooms, is currently five per cent. Under the single sales tax, the provincial portion would increase to eight per cent.""  That 5% is GST, there is no PST, so it's going from 5 to 13 not 5 to 8, how the heck does that help tourism?  sorry guys, but this stuff eats me up /rant over"
440887,462Liquid,2010-03-07 04:14:00,12, you too eh? i cant stand the government anymore... it just seems they make decisions that are beneficial to them and not to the citizens...  they should just have one guy that means what he says and does what he means also while thinkin about the people... that would be a good prime minister.
440933,Jer,2010-03-07 12:24:00,1426,"   I'm certainly no fan of the new tax, believe me!  ...but that statement is actually true. Currently there is 5% GST and 5% RST (PST for accommodation tax) for a total of 10% tax charged when renting a hotel/motel room. The HST will raise that to 13%.  I agree with you though, the spin that they are putting on this is so transparent, why do they bother."
440934,Jer,2010-03-07 12:27:00,1426,"   We had a premier like that once...Mike Harris.  Now fifteen years later, he is apparently all that is wrong with the world. Talk about spin."
440939,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-03-07 12:43:00,1107,"Yeah I'm not real impressed with this either I have e-mailed DOLTon a bunch of times and not been very nice in my e-mails and keep getting a generic reply about how the hst is going to help small business and create jobs ,I will believe it when I see it. I was just answering the OP,s question as to when the bribe money was coming lol."
440951,canuckjack,2010-03-07 13:46:00,121," Alright my bad I read the page on Ontario taxes to quickly, but I'm still not happy about it     Especially the fact that this is going to hit everyone in a big way, like heating bills next winter, that thousand bucks is only going to last so long...  Jer, I miss Mike Harris, I know some didn't like all his policies but he did exactly what he said he was going to do, and a lot of that involved spending less of our money."
441017,jjcanoe,2010-03-07 16:17:00,744,"Just in Case You Get a Cheque..... Sometime this year, we taxpayers will again receive an Economic Stimulus payment i.e HST rebate.  This is a very exciting program from the Ontario government.. I'll explain it using the Q and A format: --------------------------------------------------------------- Q.  What is  Ontario 's Economic Stimulus payment? A.  It is money that the provincial government will send to taxpayers. Q..  Where will the government get this money? A.  From taxpayers.. Q.  So the government is giving me back my own money? A.  Only a smidgen. Q.  What is the purpose of this payment? A.  The plan is for you to use the money to purchase a high-definition TV set, thus stimulating the economy. Q.  But isn't that stimulating the economy of Asia ? A..  Shut up or you don't get your check.   Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the Canadian economy by spending your stimulus check wisely:   1..  If you spend the stimulus money at Wal-Mart, your money will go to China .. 2.  If you spend it on gasoline, your money will go to Saudi Arabia . 3.  If you purchase a computer, it will go to India . 4.  If you purchase fruit and vegetables, it will go to Mexico, Honduras or Guatemala .. 5.  If you buy a car, it will go to Japan or Korea . 6.  If you purchase useless plastic stuff, it will go to Taiwan . 7.  If you pay off your credit cards, or buy stock, it will go to pay management bonuses and be hidden in offshore accounts.   Or, you can keep the money in Canada by:  1.   spending it at yard sales or flea markets, or 2.   going to hockey games, or 3.   hiring prostitutes, or 4.   buying cheap beer or 5.   getting tattoos. These are the only wholly-owned businesses still operating in  Canada .  Conclusion: The best way to stimulate the economy is to go to a hockey game with a prostitute that you met at a yard sale and drink beer all day until you're drunk enough to go get tattooed."

441064,Dara,2010-03-07 18:28:00,3052,Actually Dalton is doing a very good job of this. The HST will help small business and manufacturing. Mike harris is the guy that sold off all our power generation capabilities and left us with the debt and high power bills.
441189,Jer,2010-03-07 23:25:00,1426,"   Can you imagine how expensive hydro would be if Dalton had his fingers in the pie. We would probably be subsidizing useless wind farms in Collingwood with our hydro bill. Instead I'm sure we'll be subsidizing them through the HST to some extent, so I guess what's the difference."
441199,Rizzo,2010-03-07 23:52:00,4754,do you know how much it will cost to give these thousand dollar refund cheques out? Probably ten times the amount of the cheques themselves...but at least it creates more government jobs and opportunties for fraud that you and I end up paying for. I wish they would have just bumped up income tax a percent or two...problem solved.

WOO HOO .. I can hardly wait!!!!"
441297,Dutch,2010-03-08 03:35:00,831,"Make no mistake about it, the $1,000 is a bribe of your own money, introduced by the Provincial government, to appease the masses after introducing a new tax that will cost every end-user consumer that amount many times over.  How will this impact businesses - basically, they will no longer pay PST on their inputs, it will be treated the same as GST and be refundable to busineses.  Since the PST is no longer a cost to business, their income should go up allowing them to expand and reinvest their higher cashflow into creating new jobs and drive the economy.  This is a HUGE win for businesses essentially they will pay NO TAXES (they will get a refund of the new HST), other than income tax.  There is a mistaken belief that the government has tried to use to sell this tax, that businesses, since their costs will go down, will lower their prices and the consumer will get to buy things cheaper, thereby offsetting the increase in taxes.  To that I say.....Yeah right.....  Anyway, as much as I hate this new tax I think it will be a positive thing for business and the economy.  This will be at the expense of higher consumption taxes for individuals, but offset somewhat by a lowering of personal income tax rates."
441298,John Bacon,2010-03-08 03:35:00,3277," Actually no, Harris did not sell off our power generation capabilities.  Ontario still owns them.  McGuinty is floating the idea of selling them now.  If your dept comment refers to the Hydro dept, that was there long before Harris came to power.  He is the one the decided we should try to pay it off instead of just letting it accumulate.  As far as prices, the debt incurred by Hydro indicates that the prices they billed us was less than the cost of providing the electicity.  The price on our bills may have been lower, but we had the unseen accumulation of debt that made the real price much higher that than what was on the bill.  Now we see the real price on out bills."
441323,Chris,2010-03-08 11:28:00,405," I run a small business that provides mechanical design services mainly to the manufacturing industry. I currently do not collect any PST, only GST. I have been to the websites and read everything I can find but have not seen any way that the HST will benefit my business. Seeing as you have said that this tax will help small businesses, can you explain how? Thanks!"
