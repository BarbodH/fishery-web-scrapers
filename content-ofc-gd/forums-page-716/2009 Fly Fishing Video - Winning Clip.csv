440313,Jds63,2010-03-05 21:31:00,1365,This video tries to capture that feeling that we get when we are in the zone (fishing) .... what an awesome well done video  brings a tear to my eye ... LOL  
440327,archie_james_c,2010-03-05 22:14:00,618,Absolutely beautiful. Wish I had the resources to get into that sorta stuff.
440333,NAC,2010-03-05 22:41:00,369,"wow, I was sad when it ended!!  puts a whole new spin on rodents."
440334,Roy,2010-03-05 22:41:00,13728,"Just beautiful, JDS. I don't know how someone could not be moved by that clip."
440435,Ron,2010-03-06 01:12:00,1683,Everything in that video was AWESOME!  If that don't get ya intrigued about fly fishing nothing will!
440456,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-06 01:31:00,10439,That was pretty sweet!!!!! Not good to be a mouse in Newzealand!!!!  This ones (Video) pretty good too but nowhere near the $$$$$ that one cost to make.
441286,Jds63,2010-03-08 03:08:00,1365,"  nice video too Drifter,, I like the Mission Impossible theme, that best describes many of my outings ,,"
441308,xeon,2010-03-08 03:59:00,350,"Those are some pretty nice shots they got of the fish grabbing the ""flies"".  But ya budget wise, I'm sure not many people have the money to fly over a waterfall and film it with a HD camera."
441314,drwxr,2010-03-08 05:46:00,453,AWESOME
441614,MJL,2010-03-09 02:23:00,2427,"Sick movie with some awesome footage!  Vids like that really made me think about doing fishing photography and videography in my spare time.  That clip is only one of many submitted for the DrakeMag awards which can be found here: http://www.drakemag.com/videos/2009-films  Scroll through past years movies and be amazed. By far the most mind blasting 5min vids created about fly fishing.  Other notable vids (also my favourites) also include: - ""Running down the man"" (2006) - ""Poppy's red shed"" (2007), ""red gold"" (2007) - ""Metalhead"" (2008)  Great vid too Drifter.  Hard not to like a vid with ginormous Alaskan bows"
441640,solopaddler,2010-03-09 03:21:00,8605," Both videos are outstanding! This one hits close to home though, 'cause, well, I'm in it. Dave I had no idea you made this man! Awesome memories."
441784,kennyman,2010-03-09 15:14:00,737,That was one of the most incredible videos I've ever seen !!    WOW !!!!
441805,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-09 15:57:00,10439,"  OOPS, I thought I told you aboot it."
441809,solopaddler,2010-03-09 16:03:00,8605, Nope. Although it's highly probable you did and I forgot. As you know my brain is turning to mush.
441835,Spiel,2010-03-09 17:36:00,9065," Indeed well done, in fact it's spectacular!    Great job on that one as well Dave. Man I'd love to hit a river that big some day!    Wait till it's all mush Mike, your gonna wonder if it was ever any better, I think....."
