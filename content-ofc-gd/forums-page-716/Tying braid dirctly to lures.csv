442377,tightline,2010-03-11 01:32:00,322,"I'm running 10 pd Ugly Braid...what I notice is when I'm running 12 pound mono with my, say shad rap, it takes allot less line to get it to depth then with my 10 pd braid...like you said I thought the thinner diameter of the braid, I was thinking it would cut the water better...just something I noticed one day when I had both rods rigged"
442378,cheaptackle,2010-03-11 01:35:00,849,"I got the idea that's what you meant, but I got lost in there somewhere  If tightline ramped right up to 50# braid or higher, it's equivalent to 12# mono and your thought would bear out if he was previously running an 8 or 10# mono. I started out with 8-30 (30# test, 8# mono equivalent) and dropped to 6-20, then 2-10 & 1-8.  On my ultralights with 2-10 I can air mail a 3/8 oz weight right to the spool knots, about 220 feet or so.  I also found that I could use 1/4 oz where I might have used 3/8 to get down before (I'm talking jigs or walking sinkers).  Even with the 8-30 trolling sticks, cranks or spinners I don't notice any depth concerns, I catch as many weeds now as I did with mono! So, tightline?  What braid are you running?  What mono did you run?  Michael"
442380,cheaptackle,2010-03-11 01:38:00,849, Ya got in a bit ahead of my questions!  10 pound Ugli braid - is that equivalent to mono diameter or breaking strength?  Michael
442385,cram,2010-03-11 01:47:00,1733,"I use an improved clinch on powerpro all the time....both 10 and 80 lb test.  I have never used a palomar so can't compare, but it seems to have its fans so i assume it might be the best."
442386,cheaptackle,2010-03-11 01:55:00,849,"Just had a brainstorm (cramp?)!  Braid doesn't stretch, mono does.  Could it be the stretch factor running your baits deeper?  Michael"
442387,vinnimon,2010-03-11 01:56:00,2593,"I havent read all the replies,But I tell you If gar pike and turtles are around, while using a pickerel rig fishing for pickerel.I change up to braided line on the rigs.At times I do use it as a leader line in certain areas.Dont ask,It has saved me a few bucks in lures and the pike or pickerel are not shying away because of it."
442394,cheaptackle,2010-03-11 02:10:00,849,"vinnimon, I wondered if someone would have the exact opposite to offer!  I used to use braid all the way only, but now I use the mono/fluoro leaders because of what I read about braids being more visible, but I only just started because of that.  I was using (initially) mono leaders when jigging, because it's easier to tie direct.  Changed to fluoro this ice season and planned to continue trying it for this coming softwater season.  Guess I'll be trying all the combinations now to see what I like best.  Fun!  Michael"
442417,vinnimon,2010-03-11 03:04:00,2593,"To clarify.I was fishing murky waters,using pickerel rigs.I use the braid as a leader becuse of all the jagged rocks.And on top of that, sorry below that on my pickerel rig, I replace the mono with braid right to the hooks.I only do this when the Gar pike and snapping turtles are around.2 yrs back my bait and hooks were cleaned off after a good hit and a 3 second fight.After I changed up I found out it was the Gar, and not the turtles doing it.The turtles will steal half the minnow.Well the AYR area pond turtles do that.The Caledonia snappers just chase you up the river and bite.AND ITS NOT FUNNY MAN, I THINK THEIR TRAINED!"
442422,cheaptackle,2010-03-11 03:12:00,849, I'll be up all night with that mental image vinni! Too funny!  Michael
442136,Oeey3109,2010-03-10 13:50:00,15,Do you guys tie braid directly to any of your lures.  There are definitely applications where there is no need for a fluoro or mono leader and braid directly to a lure should work.  My question is what type of knot do you use?  I've had issues with knots slipping with braid.  Suggestions?  Thanks!

442142,cranks bait,2010-03-10 13:57:00,721,I do it all the time.  I use a palamar knot.  I've never had a problem.
442143,Spiel,2010-03-10 13:58:00,9065," Yep, that's the knot to use."
442144,tightline,2010-03-10 14:06:00,322,"The palamar knot is what I use but I tie a snap swivel to the line...saves me trying to cut braid all the time when I'm switching out lures,, and it also stops line twist"

442153,Bob Devine,2010-03-10 14:45:00,251,"I have used the palomar knot and have tied direct for yrs for jigging walleyes on the Detroit River. I also use Flame Grn braid line so I can see my line and clients lines while fishing. If a walleye is going to hit a green, orange or white jig they are not going to be concerned about being line shy. And the DR does get quite clear at times, a N or NE will send sand and particles down river making it look muddy.  "
442158,JohnF,2010-03-10 15:20:00,3494,Palomar unless it's a lure that likes a loop.  JF

442174,bdox,2010-03-10 16:44:00,329,I generally don't use snap-swivles because it's just another possible point of failure. Exceptions to this are spoons and spinnerbaits. Some lures like jerkbaits and topwaters don't achieve the correct action when not tied directly to the line. All my brait-lure connections are made with a palamar knot.

442275,douG,2010-03-10 22:26:00,2693,It's very difficult to make an improved clinch work with a braided line like powerpro or tuffline.  Use a palomar or uni knot.
442281,fishindude,2010-03-10 22:31:00,220,"Never had a palomar knot break off on me, just sucks having to re-tie so I use a snap lock for quicker lure changes as well."
442282,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-10 22:37:00,10439,"I always use a mono or flouro leader for abraision resistance, especially when trolling and bouncing my lures off bottom. Too many times I have had clients not use a leader and all of a sudden when trolling the line will break right in front of the lure where it has been banging off bottom. It's a good thing T60 Flatfish float!!!!  Oh, and for knots, Palomar, Uni and Back to Back Uni."
442293,archie_james_c,2010-03-10 23:02:00,618,  I have no problem with Improved Clinches on Power Pro/Ugly Braid/Fireline/ ect.  But I also agree with the Palomar!
442313,sirfish,2010-03-10 23:39:00,175,For braid I always have a 5 ft fleuro leader spliced with back to back uniknots with complete confidence. When doing this in no way is there any hinderance coming out of the rod eyes. If doing this the fleuro must be at least 2lbs stronger than the braid or it will cut through.
442317,tightline,2010-03-10 23:47:00,322,Not to tromp your post GCiotola but since there is so much discussion on braid I have a question...When I'm running braid for trolling I notice that my lures don't run as deep as they normally do when using mono...anybody else??  If I put a fleuro leader on would that help??
442348,archie_james_c,2010-03-11 00:43:00,618,"  What weight of braid are you running? When you switched from mono to braid did you ""bump up"" your pound test? Alot of people do this on braid because say 20 pound braid will be the same diameter as 8 pound mono (I know thats not exactly the rating but use it as an example).  You may have gone a size too big and now the thicker braid isn't cutting the water as good as the thinner mono you had...get what I'm saying? If you used to use 8lb mono or 10lb or whatever, try running 10 or 15 pound braid it is super thin and *should* cut water well and get you down there.  That's my thoughts though...anyone else ever have this problem remedied by what I described?"
442371,cheaptackle,2010-03-11 01:16:00,849,"I find that many braids tend to float unless it says sinking on the package (Gorilla had a sinking braid).  I noticed this when slip float fishing, the line to the float stayed on the surface. Archie, I think you maybe got something backwards there (typo?) or I'm getting cabin fever crosseyes - 8# mono equals 30# braid, 8# braid is equal to 1# mono, making it much thinner in profile (average diameters of course).  This thinner profile should (and does I think) cut the water better. I'm thinking the depth problem tightline experiences might be more related to mono sinking easier than braid.  I personally haven't really noticed less depth trolling with braid, nor had I heard of it.  Something else to check out in soft water season!  Michael"
442373,archie_james_c,2010-03-11 01:23:00,618,"  See, I knew I worded it all screwy . Thats what I meant...that equivalent pound test in Braid is MUCH thinner than it's equal pound in Mono (8lb braid is MUCH thinner than 8lb Mono). What I thought could be contributing to not sinking is that the OP has DRASTICALLY bumped up the pound test and his new Braid is quite a bit thicker than the old mono he had on. So that would appear to him, that the braid is not cutting water as good as his ol' trusty mono! Understand what I'm trying to say?"
