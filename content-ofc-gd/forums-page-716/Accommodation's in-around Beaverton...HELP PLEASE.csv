We will be fishing the Beaverton area and so far my search that started 20 minutes ago has netted me one place that wants $160 a night. I'll be sleeping in my VW LONG before I shell that much out.  2 Guys that just need a bed for the night. A kitchen would be great so we could clean our fish and have a fish fry, but it's not a deal breaker. If anyone knows the Beaverton area and has a place in mind please let me know.  This would be for the weekend of April 16-17-18."

441937,Ron,2010-03-09 23:03:00,1683,"Broaden your search a bit... Can't think of the name of the place at the moment, but right at the mouth of the Peferlaw Brook (River), there is a resort right on the water. tie your boat up on the docks, fish cleaning station and a very nice restaurant if you want as well.  Unless someone else chimes in for the name of the resort, I will look it up in the meantime.   Edit: found it...http://www.peninsularesort.net/ google map  Cheers, Ron..."
