440129,Big Cliff,2010-03-05 11:39:00,6899,I haven't fished Bisco in quite a few years so I don't know that I can be much help other than to tell you that the fishing was very good when we were there. We just camped out on the shore so I can't even help with the lodge but I am sure some others on here will be able to help. Have fun!

Even the bright orange x-rap my wife put on when we tried trolling faster for pike, we caught walleye. I even caught one while getting my picture taken and my jig and leech were just dangling in the water, they are everywhere."
440134,solopaddler,2010-03-05 12:03:00,8605,Yes you can portage into Indian and yes it's worth it.
441703,chris.brock,2010-03-09 05:58:00,4053,"awesome, thanks guys, and solopaddler, you should write a book ""Northern Ont. Fishing Guide, new revised edition"" seems like you've been everywhere"
