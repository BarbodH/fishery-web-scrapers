I was wondering if paired with the right rod, could it be used for bass fishing. The reason I ask is because it seems a little big.  Here are the specs...  Rapala SX4i 4 Ball Bearings Reel Size 30 Ratio 5.1:1 Line Cap 8-200   10-155   12-100  Any advice on what type of rod it could be matched with as well as what type of bass fishing it would be best for, I would greatly apreciate.  Thanks  "

441902,mikethespike,2010-03-09 21:07:00,51,"that would actually fit nicely on an : r-type rod  they're reasonably priced, I got a 6'7"" medium heavy for $99 @ the last spring boat & fishing show.  Similar shimano models sells for 3x that.  bravo_3"
