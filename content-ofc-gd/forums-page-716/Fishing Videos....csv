I know videos like the Lindner's would be AMAZING if it came in BLU-RAY quality... but I don't know if they have (or any fishing videos for that matter)....  Anyone know if there are any out there?  Cheers, A2F"
441700,rbaquial,2010-03-09 05:36:00,968,.... Did I just stump OFC or something?  Bump.....  .....In hopes of getting an answer?

441745,rbaquial,2010-03-09 13:31:00,968,"LoL - I seriously thought everyone was stumped on this...  Reason why I asked is cause, I would REALLY love to see some videos recorded on BLU-RAY... Something like  THIS  would be AWESOME to watch in BLU-RAY...."
441759,highdrifter,2010-03-09 14:08:00,2534,"You can't stump OFC dude.  It's the other way around.  There's tons of good stuff out there..  Problem is, the fisher folk who have it don't wanna rip it, and the folk that can rip it don't wanna share it!"
