And it didn't take long for this Sow hit 24/7's  Williams Wobbler              While 24/7 releases the Beast     I throw down the underwater camera and witness The Northern giving birth to a Healthy 3lb baby boy that quickly fell for a jigging spoon        On the way back home I was lucky enough to snap a pic of this Snowy Owl ..taking a rest from the journey back to the Artic..       If anyone else ever gets the chance to fish with 24/7 ........don't pass it up...

442069,mikeh,2010-03-10 03:25:00,824,"Nice pike, again .Thanks for posting"
442099,kgeary,2010-03-10 06:55:00,82,A very nice fat pike definitely well fed and likely full of eggs. did she drop any eggs on the ice?  A few years ago I caught a 48 incher a few weeks before ice out. She was staging on a large flat waiting for conditions to spawn.  this fish was so thick and heavy you wouldn't believe it. she actually had a jelly like substance oozing out between her scales. I have no doubt she weighed over 45 lbs. probably over 50. They do get very very heavy before spawning.
442316,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-10 23:45:00,709,WOW verry interesting man!  no eggs comming out.... but if i recall yes maybe some GEW OOZING out .  yes they are full of eggs wich makes them HEAVY and they are FAT!  kept a smaller one a 3-4 lbs pike and it was full of eggs also!    40 - 50 lbs!  im seriously jelouse of that one!  congrats.   note: that pike would be on my wall.
