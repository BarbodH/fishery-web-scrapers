441393,Roy,2010-03-08 16:07:00,13728,You bought a new panino recently didn't you Doug? Highly irregular  to see someone making a gweech on a panino. Do you make the gweeches on white or black? this panino is a Calabrese Grande you say?
441432,Spiel,2010-03-08 18:22:00,9065,"  Nice! Congrats my friend, you've earned it. See how it pays off to be in the right company...."
441437,Carp,2010-03-08 18:34:00,1488,Sweet fish for your first whitey douG.  Congrats !!!
441456,wallacio,2010-03-08 19:32:00,475, It was a pretty tough bite Tony...we were marking a lot of disinterested fish and the hoards of people out there certainly weren't pulling them up with the frequency that I've seen on some days (when everyone gets limits quite easily).
441486,fish-miester,2010-03-08 22:00:00,864,well im jealous ! i havnt caught a whitie yet !  lol good job
441535,MJL,2010-03-08 23:40:00,2427,Awesome report and pics douG - Congrats on beating the skunk.  Nicely done Bill and Dave on the guiding.  Tempted to try for some whities before the season ends soon...They just look so tasty!  Thanks for sharing
441697,douG,2010-03-09 05:22:00,2693,There are a few folks on the board who make it their business to put folks on fish whenever they go out.  Others just make lunch.  You know who they are.
440827,douG,2010-03-07 02:19:00,2693,"The phone traffic on Friday night decided the toss – South shore of Erie with Solopaddler for steelhead, or Simcoe with BillM for lakers and whitefish.  I’m sure that Mike had a great day off the shore somewhere or other, but that was a prime afternoon on the hardwater with Bill and Wallacio (Davey).    The weather could not have been finer.  There were also 5 less hours on the road by going to Simcoe instead of Erie, and I had a good feeling about beating my lifetime laker/whitefish skunk on the Lady.  I met with BillM and Wallacio at the reasonable hour of 6:45 at 9th line where we suited up and headed out.  We went out an incredible 7 miles onto Simcoe, with seatbelts off and windows open.  This was the view back to the shore we left from.     Dave was the first onto a whitey that couldn’t commit to fresh air, quickly followed by another by Bill with the same issue.      The action died after that, and we crossed the pressure crack and popped a few more holes.  Speaking of augers, Dave and Bill did about 30 holes today with manual augers, 14- 18 inches of clear ice everywhere. Dave had a 6 inch drill, while Bill worked an 8 incher.  They were Normarks, with sticky sharp blades, and they were incredible.  I only drilled a few holes, but now I understand why some folks won’t buy a power auger when they know what a good manual drill can do.        Around 11 am, a gold Williams ice spoon found a weight.            It was my first Simcoe whitefish, and a beauty.  There were lots of folks on the ice today, with a couple of those high maintenance flighty types.    BillM and Solopaddler are both great guys.  A thing they share is a burning yearning to put new friends onto fish, and Bill did a fine job today.  Thanks to Dave and Bill for a great day.  We will fish again.  "
440831,irishfield,2010-03-07 02:27:00,26272,Great shootin Doug!!!  I saw Hamilton fly by in his Champ.. but very disappointed I didnt't see Brent Anderson's Rebel. I helped Brent thru the build on that machine from 1993 to 1997.
440833,Leecher,2010-03-07 02:30:00,7832,"Awesome report and pics Doug That's what's all about right there..... beauty day, fishing with good friends and getting into some Congrats to all involved   :clapping: and thanks for sharing Leechman"

440838,ironstone74,2010-03-07 02:33:00,201,"Nice report and fish Doug!  I would have found it hard to pass up a chance to fish with Solo, but looks like you had a great trip.  Paul"
440849,tibbs,2010-03-07 02:58:00,650,Nice Job on the Whitefish!  Looks like you guys had a blast!
440853,BillM,2010-03-07 03:15:00,17367,"Yeah, it was a great day for sure.   The weather was absolutely perfect, however we could have used the melt a bit sooner to soften that ride out this morning.  Hooked up in the first 10mins but lost it about 10ft down...  Moved a few more times and hooked up again, with something really nice which again popped the hook...  Ah well, what can ya do!!  My mission for the day was to get Doug on a whitefish and it was mission accomplished when he brought that brute up through the hole..  Last day out on the ice for me, bring on the steel and the opener!!!!  And Doug, that sandwich was awesome!!!"
440855,462Liquid,2010-03-07 03:18:00,12,"WOW, beauty lake and a great fish! i still dont understand why i never even considered fishing that lake while i lived down there..... i deeply regret it now though! anyhow great job guys!"

440865,wallacio,2010-03-07 03:33:00,475,I'm glad that at least one of us could keep the hooks into a fish today - nice job with that Whitie!  Great to meet you Doug - you can fish with Bill and I anytime...just keep bringing those sandwiches!

440910,Syn,2010-03-07 05:12:00,519,Incredible pictures. 7 miles out with seatbelts off and windows open (just in case). Planes on the ice too. My jaw dropped. Quite the adventure. Glad to see you all had a great time.

440963,mattyk,2010-03-07 14:14:00,2110,nice looking white fish.
441016,Beans,2010-03-07 16:15:00,3339, Our buddy Meely might challange your statement Brian...He taught doogles how to make them g'weeches...
441019,LeXXington,2010-03-07 16:27:00,1928,WTG --- Doug.  Great report looks like you all had a great time
441278,ehg,2010-03-08 02:38:00,2666,Simcoe seems to be producing this March. Great report and nice whitefish
441295,douG,2010-03-08 03:31:00,2693,"Meelly,  that Calabrese Grande, for sure taught me the spirit of the Italian sandwich / sangweech / gweech.  You need to start with a nice Calabrese panino, a mid size crusty bun.  Then you need some salami, cappicola, pastrami, your choice.  I've heard that some don't like ham, or prosciutto, or  stuff like that.  Or pickles.  Bill.  Slice the buns, pile high with your cold cuts, and use butter, caesar salad dressing, mustard or pickles.  I like an aged provolone cheese sliced thin to add that last little kick."
441388,tonyb,2010-03-08 15:46:00,1637,"Looks like a good time on the ice, congrats on breaking the skunk Doug!....were you finding the fish were real finicky or were you getting a lot of chasers?  Tony"
