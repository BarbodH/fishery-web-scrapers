Well he gave me some advice and I thanked him, but I told him I wasn't going to pay $60 to him for him to do the work.  But what I did find out is this guy is an interesting feller.  Hes an old farmer that just happens to own a small plane in which he has a cabin way up north somewhere around Buffalo Narrows.  I was really interested in what he told me about his remote cabin and the fishing on the lake that he flies into.  Anyways to make a long story short, it seems that when his cabin was vacated he had bear problems.  The Bears would  get in to his cabin through his boarded windows and just make a huge mess.  He told me that once a bear finds away in, its almost impossible to stop them from doing it again.  But he found out a way.  A hinged Board with 2 ' dry wall screws as a deterrent under the windows.  The hinge allowed the board to be propped up when occupied.  He says since he installed the boards, no more bear problems.  Has any one ever heard of this.   you can see the boards propped up underneathe the windows.  "

441723,trevy727,2010-03-09 12:18:00,351,I have also seen it done with nails by some Americans on a fly-in lake called Geejay. I built them a new cottage up there and there were many bears. It was a great experience. We flew in every Monday and out Fridays. We had all the material flown in by helicopter in one day. We stayed in a trapper cabin and built a 1200sq' new one right beside it. Fished and swam every night. It was a great 3 months.
