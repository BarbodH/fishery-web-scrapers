As of this afternoon, we have pulled 76 lakers and 5 whities through the hole in the last 7 trips.  Many fish kept for the cooker, many fish released.  Everything caught in 75-91 feet of water on a mixture of spoons, tubes, zonkers and laker takers.  Too much to report all at once, but I enjoyed the company of everyone these past few weeks and thanks to everyone for making my inaugural ice season a successful one.  Met a bunch of board members this year, hope to meet more in the future.  Enjoy the pics from the past bunch of trips.               "

441275,ironstone74,2010-03-08 02:27:00,201,Nice job Steve.  Looks like your hard work has paid off!  Paul
441276,splashhopper,2010-03-08 02:30:00,2931,any fish left there
441505,steverowbotham,2010-03-08 22:45:00,1800," Haha, I knew one of these was coming.  We released a lot more fish than what was kept over the past few weeks.  We've had a good ratio of stockers/naturals, almost 50/50 and the majority of the naturals went back, plus many stockers as well.  Tons of fish to go around."

441554,bucktail,2010-03-09 00:24:00,1857,Those are some VERY well fed Lakers....congrats!
441558,fish-miester,2010-03-09 00:29:00,864,lol I know who I'll be goin with next year when I go for lakers
441560,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-09 00:30:00,2690," I can support Steve on this one.  We landed 3, two were released (one stocker, one natural)...Steve's buddy also hooked two (reeled in by our boys) 3 lber kept by us, the other released. I know I've been pretty hard on the ministry in some threads, but, I must say...Simcoe is managed extremely well.  With the amount of fishing pressure this lake gets it is astounding the numbers of fish there are to be had.  The amount of smelt/baitfish in the ones we caught is incredible...the bellies bulge like a fish full of spawn!!!"
441668,Cudz,2010-03-09 04:17:00,2652,nice.
441906,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-09 21:13:00,709,  you dont need to justify that man.  its your decision to keep or release what eer you want as long as its in the limit slots.
442064,mikeh,2010-03-10 03:09:00,824,Congrats on all those lakers. Did you keep track of the largest laker and whitefish for the season?
