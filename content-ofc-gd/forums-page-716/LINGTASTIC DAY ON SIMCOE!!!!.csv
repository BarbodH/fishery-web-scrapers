441479,BUSTER,2010-03-08 21:29:00,1336,"WOW , great catch"
441523,phiphntek,2010-03-08 23:16:00,115,"Ling Cod..... also known as poor mans lobster.Never had it but am looking forward to the day I do.Clean it , cube it, boil it in salted water for 5 mins then give em a bath in melted garlic butter."
441616,Sharkbait22,2010-03-09 02:30:00,297,The ling are likely grouped together because they are winter spawners. This might explain the high numbers. In Alberta the water can turn white this time of year in some locations from all the ...  you know.
441619,Carp,2010-03-09 02:38:00,1488,WOW !!!  Some sweet fish you caught. Good job.  thanks for sharing.
441820,BucktownAngler,2010-03-09 16:45:00,582,What are the daily limits on the Ling on simcoe?
441832,Carp,2010-03-09 17:26:00,1488,"I don't think there is a limit for ling on Simcoe. Don't recall anything in the regs, but I wasn't exacly looking for ling regs anyway. I would imagine they are considered a coarse fish and therefore, probably do not have a daily creel limit."
441833,Harrison,2010-03-09 17:26:00,2202,Awesome John!  Action packed!
441837,Kinger,2010-03-09 17:46:00,351,"No limits on ling.  I get into them good in June and July in the river, they are so tasty!"
441890,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-09 20:00:00,709,SON OF A LING!  the sight of those horible creature will haunt my dream the rest of my life!
441973,Cudz,2010-03-09 23:51:00,2652,Those are some brutes. Pretty sure the ontario record is around 13 pounds.  Any idea how much your heavy ones weighed?
442067,mikeh,2010-03-10 03:18:00,824,I'ved never seen a Simcoe report with this many Ling and large ones also. I'm also curious the weight on your heaviest one and length.
442076,ozaibak1,2010-03-10 03:44:00,401,"There was a report last year of someone that caught a big ling on Simcoe and I thought that was impressive. His ling was pushing the Simcoe record. Judging from the size of the two in your pic, I'd say you're pretty close to breaking or have already broke the record with those monster ling, you should check it out!  This is my favorite icefishing report this year. Rare fish few people catch, in such numbers and with great size is truly impressive, that possibility is what keeps me hooked on fishing just a little extra. Thanks for sharing!"
440913,John Kimble,2010-03-07 05:24:00,12,"Hi y'all!  Ice Fishing Lake Simcoe in March is AWESOME!!! Yesterday's trip by Sparky yielded 7 Ling Cod and 6 Whities, while today yielded 12 more Ling Cod and 4 whities. Yes, that's a mind boggling NINETEEN LING COD caught! Even had our first ever Triple Header Ling Cod today. It was SIMPLY AMAZING! Not bad for a few hours of fishing eh? I've never seen so many Ling Cod being caught on Simcoe before. WOW!!!! We are strong supporters of Catch and Release Fishing so 9 of the 19 Ling Cod were releaesd to swim another day. This was a trip I will never forget.  Travel today was great for sleds or atv. Main Lake- 60+FOW. Secret Spot.  Be safe and Cheers!  Ryan  (aka John Kimble, Marine Biologist and Hard Water Bad Boyz Club Member)  P.S. - We were checked by the OPP/Conservation officer for the 6th time this season on Simcoe (YES SIX TIMES!). Glad to see they are out there patrolling our waters. Plus if you haven't seen it already, here's the youtube video on ""How to clean a perch in 10 seconds""   Enjoy!  Two Whities   Hello!   Buddy Jon with a nice Ling   J.Kimble with one - YEEEE HAW!!!!!   Another pic   Some Keepers "
440917,Syn,2010-03-07 06:30:00,519,Great reporting and pics . Amazing colour pattern on those fish. Never knew Ling Cod was so near Barrie. Thought you were catching them somewhere way up north at first.  Looks like a prehistoric walleye. Does it even taste like a walleye or something totally different?   :thumbsup_anim:
440927,Terry,2010-03-07 11:27:00,14456,"they are damn ugly   the fish that is...LOL  way to go guys, I have never tried eating a ling  when I was a kid I was told to leave then on the ice  for the birds.....who knew"
440942,radar,2010-03-07 12:46:00,138,Sure is ugly. How do they taste?  Wonder how many times I cut myself trying to clean those perch this year?
440943,fishdawg,2010-03-07 12:50:00,912,"never seen a haul of ling like that anywheres, let alone Simcoe congrats"
440965,mattyk,2010-03-07 14:15:00,2110,good stuff!
440967,tjsa,2010-03-07 14:19:00,1578,"I agree with fishdawg, most I have seen caught in one day was 2. That's a nice catch of fish. Haven't caught a ling for a while now, and it wasn't that size. They taste great. Very light flakey flesh. And rather easy to clean, just peel the skin off with a pair of pliers, and remove the meat from the cartilage."
440969,fish_fishburn,2010-03-07 14:23:00,1311,"To be honest with you all, The ling cod taste better than walleye. The best tasting fresh water fish by far."
440989,TJQ,2010-03-07 15:04:00,7806,"Id be interested in how they tastes a s well, ive never had them.. ugly or not!  great report!!"
440990,danbouck,2010-03-07 15:05:00,4380,Nice Report!
440992,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-07 15:08:00,3761,"Nice catches guys, they must fight like no other fish!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
440997,Kinger,2010-03-07 15:22:00,351,"Ling don't fight well,  but they are amazing to eat.  Those are nice sized Ling."
440999,Leecher,2010-03-07 15:29:00,7832,WOW..... that's a lot of ling    and big ones too Congrats John Kimble
441003,douG,2010-03-07 15:33:00,2693,"Incredible, John.  What a haul!  If I caught a ling, I'd be keeping it for the table for sure."
441014,tibbs,2010-03-07 16:12:00,650,Great Job!

441020,kerr,2010-03-07 16:33:00,77,"best tasting best fighting,pretty much the best fish u can get through the ice, i have been in the same situation when the burbots willl just keep pummeling your bait one after another and it is awesome. keep your eyes open for a fifteen pounder as that is goona be the easiest record to break, best report ever man, seriously"
441033,Roy,2010-03-07 16:58:00,13728,"Man oh man! That's one heck of a haul of burbot. the very best day I've ever had with them is TWO and they were smaller than yours. And yes, best freshwater fish there is for the table. I don't understand people not liking them because of how they look but don't bat an eye eating oversized crustaceans that look like cockroaches from hell.  Thanks for the report and super pics."
441039,limeyangler,2010-03-07 17:16:00,5204,AMAZING FISHING!!!  awesome...epic....banner day...running out of cliches.......lol.  Those are some big ling......time to mix up a huge vat of beer batter....peel some potatoes and open a chip truck for the best Fish 'n' Chips to be found outside of England (of course)  Great report and pics.....   Simcoe never fails to impress me.
441041,Joey,2010-03-07 17:23:00,9122,"Wow, that's allota Ling  Great report and pics.  I too am surprised at how many ling you caught, that's amazing - who knew??  Joey"
441060,CLofchik,2010-03-07 18:16:00,854,"Dang, that's some serious burbot fishin'!  I've caught 3 in one day out of Hamilton and that's it, never saw another one again."
441070,Stern Rules,2010-03-07 18:37:00,342,I'd be happy if I caught one ling but holy Jesus man. Good job.
441084,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-07 19:09:00,2050,Absolutely awesome!  Truly a day of a lifetime!
441279,ehg,2010-03-08 02:41:00,2666,"Wow, that is a ton of ling! Simcoe is doing well."
441282,[emailÂ protected],2010-03-08 02:48:00,97,"Looks like you guys had a few incredible days of fishing....All these pics have got me itching to fish beyond belief...The soft water season can't come soon enough... Are ling caught more often under the ice or during the summer months as well?  Cheers, Fishingitus"
