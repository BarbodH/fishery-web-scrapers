441627,Gerritt,2010-03-09 02:50:00,6129,do it yourself! they are super simple!  and if you have ANY questions post them here and I will be sure to answer.  G.  (PS... cheapest place I have found for grid and tile is Clares in Hamilton)
441637,muskymike,2010-03-09 03:17:00,772," Agreed, dont pay someone, its a waste of your money. Do it yourself, G can help, and I can add if he misses anything.  Check Patene as well, sometimes if you get the right guy they will help out.  Or try calling a Drywall company and find out what they would sell it to you for."
441644,Nanook,2010-03-09 03:29:00,565," Dropped ceilings are a piece of cake to do. Just make sure everything is level. Heck, if i can do it anyone can. I had variable lights installed as well, but I got a 'trician to do that. [bro-in-Law] Go for it and save a bundle."
441688,charlied,2010-03-09 04:52:00,584,"ya i figured i could do it myself.  I got a qoute of material in town here for $740.  But i am gonna go over to Buffalo and get it for $320.  Huge difference in material pricing.  I have done one before, woman said she would prefer if a professional would do it...lol.   Oh the love of a woman."
441690,HTHM,2010-03-09 04:57:00,4082,And I am happy to correct any mistakes that G. makes.....
