441862,TJQ,2010-03-09 18:53:00,7806,Well if my luck revolving around the Olympics holds... we're in for a huge snowstorm...  I'm taking the plow off my 4-wheeler today...
441864,Spiel,2010-03-09 18:56:00,9065,Rumour has it everything you do is premature.
441865,cheaptackle,2010-03-09 18:57:00,849, Here I thought I'd misread the weather network!  Michael
441866,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-09 18:57:00,4399,Good one!!!  T.J. please leave the plow on for another couple of weeks!!
441869,bigfish1965,2010-03-09 19:00:00,3382,I swear if it snows you are coming here and plowing my driveway....
441875,solopaddler,2010-03-09 19:12:00,8605,That's cool. Me? I've got an uncanny ability to produce monsoon-like rains on demand by simply pitching a tent. I swear on my extended 4 month trip in the bush people were building arks. Farmers should pay me for my services when drought hits.
441876,ketchenany,2010-03-09 19:12:00,3229,Have you been picking mushrooms?

441884,solopaddler,2010-03-09 19:41:00,8605,   I'm a little slow on the uptake but I get it now.  If I created rain every time I pitched your kind of tent we'd be living in some kind of weird futuristic water world ruled by dolphins.
441893,Dara,2010-03-09 20:13:00,3052,Snowing like mad here now...I hear its moving your way
