441917,northshore,2010-03-09 22:23:00,13,"I know the 1 pc trigger rods are stronger, better, etc.. etc. but not all of us have a bassboat where we can safely transport a 7' 1pc rod. I looked and looked - can't find a decent 2 pc 7' MH / H trigger rod? Does BPS shop even sell 2 pc trigger rods? Looking for something that i can pull largies out of the pads with - matching it with BPS extreme baitcaster. Also would like to use it to chuck large spinner baits for muskie and pike. Any suggestions? My wife will only allow me to buy rods up to $100 bucks.. sorry no Gloomis for me, until i allow her to buy a Gucci purse.  BTW: i'm new here - do i need to introduce myself to ask a general fishing question? If I introduce myself fully can I ask for secret spots?? haha.. just kidding.. I'm in Toronto, Ontario, 38, male, and i fish all the local lakes every chance I get - mostly Simcoe, Scugog and Rice."

I fish out of a 12"" tinner, and a 16' canoe, and have no problem with a 1 piece...don't compromise....the 1-pc thing is really not an issue."
441928,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-09 22:41:00,4399,I have 2 Shimano Izumi signiture two piece baitcasters and they are very good I don`t buy into the theory that one piece is so much better.  You can try LeBaron that`s where I bought mine but that was several years ago.
441969,solopaddler,2010-03-09 23:44:00,8605,"2pc baitcasters are actually quite common at least in the Canadian market. Look harder you'll find what you need. I have two, one a 61/2' St. Croix Premier, the other a 7' Fenwick HMG. I primarily use them while on my canoe trips..."
