Picked him up and he could hardly open his/her eyes or keep it's balance. I took it home and later that day it started to keep its balance by spreading it's wings. I kept it in a box over night and gave it water and some fish. The next day it wasn't so friendly. I took the box out onto the deck and after an hour or so, it flew off. Never did figure out what was wrong with it. Wasn't bleeding anywhere. Maybe just sick?    "
441528,Dozer,2010-03-08 23:26:00,896,Sometimes they hit cars and get startled.  Pretty bird

441532,vinnimon,2010-03-08 23:33:00,2593,"Sometimes?I think they go after their own reflection from the windshield.  I had a few hit mine and flew away.What a scare I tell you.As for your being ill,probably ate some rd side kill that was going bad."
441533,trevy727,2010-03-08 23:37:00,351,"Oh Yeah, that white stuff on my pants is paint not what it looks like."

441677,bigfish1965,2010-03-09 04:26:00,3382,"Good job taking care of the fella overnight.  There are a few places in Ontario that care for injured birds of prey. If you encounter and injured hawk or owl, you may want to find a rehab center."
441689,skeeter,2010-03-09 04:52:00,1907,i only said he was drunk rick. i never accused him of being an alcoholic. rehab-------   LOL
441705,jediangler,2010-03-09 06:21:00,1923,"Glad to hear it flew away on it's own. Like Rick said if you ever come across a raptor in distress, Mountsberg conservation area has a center devoted to these beautiful birds.  http://www.conservationhalton.on.ca/ShowCa...m?subCatID=1455"

441709,Whitespinnerbait,2010-03-09 10:12:00,2038,A Red Tailed Hawk ...flies again...       Good on ya..
441720,trevy727,2010-03-09 12:09:00,351," No I don't think it ate the fish or had any water.    I actually called a lady that does rehabilitate wild animals and left a message, but, she didn't return my call until the next evening when the bird was already gone.    It was a fully grown rough legged hawk."
441770,4thgen,2010-03-09 14:33:00,157," You can see the dark wrist patches in pic with the wings up and the last pic certainly rules out a Red Tailed. Looks like a rough legged to me.  When birds hit things they get stunned, usually due to some swelling that puts pressure on the brain which leads to behaviour very much like you described. Wildlife rehap centers and FLAP (of which I was a member) will inject the birds with an anti inflammatory -- dexamethasone was used then, not sure if it still is. At this point they pretty much do what you did and hold on to the birds until they die or are ready to go.  Anyway, sounds like an awesome experience with a good ending, congrats."
