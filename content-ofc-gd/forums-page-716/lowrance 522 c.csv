442101,kgeary,2010-03-10 07:02:00,82,has anyone had any luck with the lowrance 522c It is a color lcd unit with built in gps I had 18 = one in each of my guest boats and after one season had zero still working. curious if anybody had good luck with them. or has ideas on which unit I might have better luck with. kg
442110,scugpg,2010-03-10 08:56:00,1373,Only thing I ever heard or experienced is the GPS sometimes not finding or losing position - its one of Lowrance's best units out there along with the 520.
442122,SlowPoke,2010-03-10 12:03:00,2984,No problems with my 522 after a year and the 525 has been flawless for 3-4 yrs. They don't see the water time 'guest boats' would but I'm happy with them thus far.
442124,darsky,2010-03-10 12:23:00,586,"Kevin I believe all their ""value"" priced gps/sonar combos are discontinued in favor of HDS units. Good luck finding 17. Maybe Basspro or Cabelas are still liquidating the Eagle units"
442125,Whopper,2010-03-10 12:26:00,2174,If it was me and I bought 18 units I believe a call to the rep would be in order before I bought another  Hey but that just me
442127,lew,2010-03-10 12:45:00,12766,"The 522 is sposed to be a very good unit and it seems really strange that all 18 would go down the tube in the 1st year. I'm wondering if there was some how a bad batch of units all produced at the same time and you got a whole shipment of them.  If nothing else, they should all be under warranty  Definetely a call to Lowrance would be in order."
442201,xeon,2010-03-10 18:11:00,350,I've had problems with the GPS creating a short somewhere with the unit. Other than that there hasn't been any sonar issues.
442231,trapshooter,2010-03-10 19:35:00,1234,Crappy deal Kevin.  What happened to them all?  I'm surprised to hear that since I've used several different lowrance products for a lot of days on the water and have had very little go wrong.  I'd be calling Lowrance as well.
442237,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-10 19:56:00,0,What kind of troubles are you having? Fuse gone? Bad wiring from self maybe?   Not installed properly? Transducer not working from cold weather storage? The crystals screw up from freezing temps...   Try this link.  http://www.fixya.com/support/p790638-lowra...en_color_intern   I've never had any issues with any of the Lowrance units I have bought over the years or have I heard of any from other people I know as well.
442247,Handlebarz,2010-03-10 20:35:00,3790,Dang that sucks for sure I have had mine since last winter I used it all winter and alot in the summer with out a problem (knock on wood) that sure does seem odd that all 18 are having trouble try calling Josolyn at Angling Outfitter in woodstock he will be able to let you know for sure what is going on he is the BEST for these things in my opinion. If there is nothing he can do he will treat you right for getting into new units if he can not help I would think you are outta luck. Just me thinking out loud again.
442254,scugpg,2010-03-10 21:03:00,1373,I think we need some more info here to help.....18 dying that's quite excessive. Any chance of blown fuses or vandalism?
442408,xeon,2010-03-11 02:37:00,350,"Were they in a spot where people could have hit them with the net handles or paddles? Did you have inline fuses of the right amperage (3 I think)? What has lowrance said about your units? I mean, you easily spent $10-14000 equipping your boats."
442434,kgeary,2010-03-11 03:36:00,82,They started acting up almost immediately I narrowed it down to the mapping chip. seemed like everytime it rained the chip would get wet.  problems varied from no sonar  or no gps or just plain nothing. seemed if I kept them inside for a few days some would get going again. finally got down to zero working.
