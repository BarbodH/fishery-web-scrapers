441470,tonyb,2010-03-08 20:57:00,1637,"GONG! hehehe looks like a fun day in some beautiful weather.  Tough go for Wayne, Terry.  But a few fish onto the ice and it's easy to forget about those mishaps  Tony"
441472,corvette1,2010-03-08 21:05:00,1765,awesome trip congrats sounds like a rough trip getting there
441477,NAW,2010-03-08 21:26:00,4022,"Glad to see you got the fishfinder figured out.  It sure was a rough weekend on our gear too.  Broke the auger, a rod, the fishfinder, etc...  Also broke a 1 month no whitefish drought, so it was worth it.  Pulled up two massive hogs..  Congrets on the fun trip.."
441491,Terry,2010-03-08 22:10:00,14456," is he really, I don't know what made me pick him....it just seemed right..LOL"
441680,limeyangler,2010-03-09 04:31:00,5204,"Wow...i almost missed this post...Sorry El Capitano!  Classy post Joey, great pics too.  By the way...its my birthday on Saturday....wish someone would buy me a knife like that...    GO TEAM #5!"
441715,Sugarpacket,2010-03-09 11:46:00,82,great report always feels nice to get that skunk out of your hair!
441931,johnnyb,2010-03-09 22:46:00,3413,Maybe I'm not catching enough fish becaues I'm not breaking enough gear!!!  Nice outing everybody
441974,daryl0815,2010-03-09 23:54:00,225,"Great post, and its nice to see so many people enjoying time together regardless of setbacks or physical pain. Congrats on the de-skunkifying!"
442027,MJL,2010-03-10 01:33:00,2427,Congrats Joey on the de-skunking.  Looks like an awesome time for all.  Great post and pics
440749,Joey,2010-03-06 23:59:00,9122,"Met up with Terry, Wayne, Lloyd and Aile Goby on Simcoe today.  So far this year Paul and I have been skunked, but I washed that skunk right out of my hair today!!!  We had a rough ride out on crusted over slush with a million tire/sled tracks to contend with.  By the time we got to the spot Lloyd was set up at, Wayne had lost his auger cap, Terry's fishfinder was broken, everyone's pop/water bottles had busted open in their coolers and any kind of food was bashed to a million pieces  Oh ya, and I think Wayne ran over his glasses too  We set up and Lloyd gave me a quick tutorial on my pain in the arse fishfinder which helped immensely and contributed to my catching my fish.  Thanks Lloyd!!  Paul had the first fish on tho, a nice laker.  Got it right to the hole and then the fish banged off the edge of the hole and was gone.  Lloyd getting ready for the grab.    Then is was my turn, and I got it to the hole and Paul scooped it out  A nice 28 incher.    Terry decided to move and in the process, broke his thumb on his auger somehow, so was in alot of pain the rest of the day.  It was swollen up pretty good and bruised.  Kind of funny to hear him reeling in a fish going ow, ow, ow!!!  We didn't mark any fish for quite awhile so Terry and the two of us decided to move.  It was a good move because Terry got into this nice Whitey right off the bat - YAY!    Video of Terry's fish:  he was having a hard time because his reel broke, then he thought he had it by the tail, then Paul thought it was by the middle, but it ended up being caught by the mouth but was stuck on the ice at the side of the hole.  I can't believe they got it on the ice!!    Wayne somehow found us without a GPS later and tried to set up.  And Wayne wonders why he can't catch any fish on Simcoe    Coupla other shots.  Terry Jigging    Paul smiling    We left around 4 p.m., and I must say, my face is sunburned and hurtin!  But it was still a great day on the ice.  Great company and some fish to boot.  Got home and it was time to filet.  The Horror!!    Got 6 nice filets out of her with the new knife Paul bought me down in a little shop in Belle River where the guy makes his own knives.  This one was made out of wood knot.  It cut like butter.    So 28 more inches for Team 5 - The Reel Deal  Cheers,  Joey"
440757,douG,2010-03-07 00:08:00,2693,"Wow,  joey, just a fabulous report.  One of your best, for sure.  That is some fine camera work, nice control of depth of field, I gotta learn that.  I have to make a post about today too, and this one just makes me sad.  A tough act to follow.  That's a great laker, too, btw."
440762,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-07 00:21:00,1362,Nice report Joey.....way to go on the de-skunked Laker.  Gotta love the pic of Wayne doing what he does best
440765,irishfield,2010-03-07 00:26:00,26272,YEP.. expensive day for sure!!! Would we do it again.. in a heart beat! lol  Strike one.. Ran over my glasses with the sled in the parking lot.    Strike two... lost my blade cover somewhere out there and went back to look for it .. but it appears that someone grabbed it quick for me so that they could return it pronto.. well one can hope! (haven't lost this thing in well over a 1000 miles of running and bushwacking.. can't beleive it disappeared today)  Lunch destroyed... got set up.. opened the cooler bag and found that my Mr. Noodles were already opened for me.. the Chief BoyRD can had already opened a water bottle for me and the soup was ready in the bottom of the bag!!  Fish finders buggered up... other stuff missing or broken but hell ya.. we had a GREAT day.  Joey and Paul    Don't you dare lose it hun..    Beautiful Stocker.    and the happy angler..    They still can't believe I followed their sled/hut tracks from the North side of Kempenfelt.. way down to Snake Island. Hell.. I can't believe it myself... but I did.. right to Terry's whitie on the ice!
440768,BillM,2010-03-07 00:34:00,17367,So it wasn't Wayne who flew the plane onto the ice today?
440770,Terry,2010-03-07 00:35:00,14456,"I had a great time fishing with you guys as always the broken radio, the broken fishfinder , broken rod oh and thumb, well stuff happens. we move on sure was a rough ride..LOL yeah the reel fell of the rod while reeling in the fish , trying to hold everything together to bring that fish in was..interesting......  I still don't know how Wayne found us, be he was good at hide and seek...      Aile Goby hiding in there somewhere     Lloyd lying back chatting with Wayne    Joey and Paul "
440775,Leecher,2010-03-07 00:50:00,7832,"Awesome report, pics and video Joey You guys sure got a beautiful day to be out on the hard stuff and got into some beauties Sounds like fun was had by everyone..... congrats to all involved  Man I can't believe Terry got a broken thumb    and a few other things Hope you're OK mon chum  Thanks for sharing Leechman"
440781,irishfield,2010-03-07 00:55:00,26272,I gotta thank TJ and friends for putting OFC together... I've said it before and I'll say it again.. if you aren't using this board to meet new life long friends.. you're missing out!!!
440798,Joey,2010-03-07 01:17:00,9122,"Thanks for the replies everyone, it really was alot of fun today.  Love the video Terry, Willie is one of my fav's  DouG, where's this so called report  Shall we do it all again tomorrow ?????"
440801,irishfield,2010-03-07 01:22:00,26272, Well... Terry does have a thumb left...
440803,Joey,2010-03-07 01:26:00,9122,"Ya, but will you be able to see without glasses"
440806,Terry,2010-03-07 01:31:00,14456,"the thumb I can deal with but fishing blind because of a broken, guess i should say 2 broken fishfinders   I just can't do it"
440810,Leecher,2010-03-07 01:34:00,7832, I got to hand it to you Terry (and no pun intended about your broken thumb).... never a dull moment in your outings / adventures
440814,irishfield,2010-03-07 01:41:00,26272,"You know Joey.. If I hadn't already unloaded the sled and hut.. and took the trailer off and parked it.. I might be game, but with it all put away, I think I'll hit the shop and get some work done tomorrow!  Not sure what Terry's issue is though... he caught his only fish while fishing blind !!!"
440815,BUSTER,2010-03-07 01:50:00,1336,N-ice  report!
440823,bigugli,2010-03-07 02:14:00,6138, You got that right!
440842,Tybo,2010-03-07 02:38:00,1373,It was great seeing you guy's. To bad the skunk smell was so ripe on me. Wayne could smell it half way down the lake.
440843,irishfield,2010-03-07 02:40:00,26272, SORRY.. I was trying to be polite when I told them I followed your sled/hut tracks!!
440845,fishhunter,2010-03-07 02:52:00,604,Well like always always great to fish with friends. Ill be out again tomorrow at Lloyd O clock lol I did find the mother load later on after we did the big move after you did. Terry tex me in the morning. It was so nice to see Joey get that laker and miss a couple others. I'm glad that trick I showed you paid off.  Wayne you are so right when you say OFC has been great for making friendships. Hats off to the people that make this happen.
440850,tibbs,2010-03-07 03:04:00,650,Nice Job!
440981,tjsa,2010-03-07 14:39:00,1578,"Great report Joey, congrats on the de-skunking. I know those rough rides to fishing locations all too well. I don't bring soda pop along for that very reason any more, cleaning pepsi or coke out of the action packer and everything that was in it was not fun.  Broken fishfinder/reel falling off/broken thumb/parts missing...................sounds like quite the adventure/calamity..........but makes for a good story when it all works out fine in the end. At least it wasn't -25C when all this happened.  It was a stellar day up here also, -5C morn, 7C afternoon, sun all day, and we caught fish."
440991,danbouck,2010-03-07 15:07:00,4380,Congrats on the de-skunking!
441028,Roy,2010-03-07 16:49:00,13728,"Fantastic report Joey! Good weather, good friends and good fishing. PERFECT! Some really fine pics there too! What time is supper?"
441032,Handlebarz,2010-03-07 16:57:00,3790,great report for sure and Wayne you are right this place sure has made me some life long friends even if we dont get together all the time we can keep in close touch here.  I guess I missed out today as Slowpoke left a message last night when we were out asking me to join him out there today Oh well I guess instead of fishing I will unpack the van and give it a break from fishing gear until June.
441415,SlowPoke,2010-03-08 17:41:00,2984," June? Whadareya, nuts? There's a lot of fishing to be done in April and May! Sorry about the last minute invite. I juggled my workload and made a last minute decision.   Great report Joey and sorry to hear about the carnage! It's amazing how a few friends and fish can change 'the worst fishing day ever' into 'you guys wanna do it again tomorrow?' We found the trek from K-Bay/Oro to the Whitefish grounds a lot smoother than our last leg to I-Beach. Managed about 50km/h vs. 15-20 and a lot more evasive maneuvers!"
