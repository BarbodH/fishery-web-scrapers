441722,MJL,2010-03-09 12:12:00,2427,Not sick myself but sounds like it could be Norovirus (Norwalk virus).  Saw on the news a couple weeks ago it was making rounds across southern Ontario.  My sister is a pharmacist at the hospital and she tells me she sees a few cases each year...Definitely no picnic for the next few days.  Highly contagious.  Drink plenty...Hope you and your family get better soon
441739,aniceguy,2010-03-09 13:15:00,1094,the grim reaper and I are talking hourly thats how sick I am..Started Friday and has gotten worse since...............
441741,Harrison,2010-03-09 13:19:00,2202,"Yes Sir, went through all 4 of us last week.  4 yr old got it Sat night, wife Sun, 1.5 yr old Sun night and me Monday.  All lasted about 24 hrs, can't wait to see my water bill this month!"
441749,blaque,2010-03-09 13:34:00,2419,"This went thru my house.......my sisters house...... a couple co-workers houses, a few weeks back now......(im in western new york)  I hadnt hit the bucket like that in YEARS. Twas Ugly for sure"
441851,BUSTER,2010-03-09 18:31:00,1336, I think your correct http://www.toronto.ca/health/norwalk.htm
441860,addymark,2010-03-09 18:50:00,69,had it 2 weeks ago.  dry heaves are the worst part.
441870,bigfish1965,2010-03-09 19:03:00,3382,"Had it a few weeks ago..worse part is not being sure what end stuff is gonna come out of. My suggestion (through experience) is when you are gonna puke, take a bucket and sit on the can at the same time. I learned I am not a graceful vomitter!!"
441871,lucabrasi,2010-03-09 19:08:00,114,"I'm going on 2 weeks now. No vomiting for me but got everything else. Nasal congestion and cough are something else. I haven't had it this bad in years. The way I'm feeling right now, the symptoms could go on for another week. What's really frustrating is that with a newborn niece around I've done everything humanly possible to the point of compulsive hand washing not to get this. Hope everyone gets better soon."
441873,Harrison,2010-03-09 19:10:00,2202,Rick.  I found also the dollorama Popcorn buckets work great for the little ones!
441880,discophish,2010-03-09 19:19:00,392,"Sorry to hear that everyone is sick.  I know times are tough when it is as bad as you say.  Definitely not a good thing to put up with.  So with that said, would all of you mind telling me where you are at all times so that I can keep a safe distance?"
441921,aplumma,2010-03-09 22:28:00,6896,"Here is the advice given to me by my doctor when ever you get a stomach bug.    To avoid dehydration continue to drink fluids and gradually eat a bland diet such as the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and dry toast). A bland diet is easily digested and is unlikely to irritate your stomach.  Hope it helps   Art"
441950,Bernie,2010-03-09 23:16:00,3190,"Ya. It finally hit me too. Been out for two days but starting to come around. Hope it's better soon, need to get back to work."

441957,Billy Bob,2010-03-09 23:25:00,5865,"WOW, sounds like a lot of you guys in the Great White North are getting it bad....well at least it's not the H1N1 flue as that can kill you........my oldest son is a doctor at William Patterson Air Force Base and he had a 26 year old pregnant women with the H1N1 flue.....unfortunately she lost the baby and last I heard she was only getting a 30% chance of survival.......I felt so bad I haven't and wouldn't ask how she made out."
441964,lucabrasi,2010-03-09 23:35:00,114,"  Unfortunately, it usually is. Heavy doses of vitamin c might help."
