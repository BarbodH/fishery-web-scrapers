441733,JEREMY,2010-03-09 13:02:00,300,Thats some nice company and land you got there
441752,Beans,2010-03-09 13:40:00,3339,Breakfast at 07:48 AM ??? That used to be your lunch time !!!...All the fresh air must be making you hungry and tired like it does me...not sure if that is a good thing or not...  Nice to see the deer...we had a herd of about 15 out back a few days ago...most headed down towards the lake but 4 came across the front of our property...someone up the road must be feeding them...
441756,highdrifter,2010-03-09 13:58:00,2534,They're pretty to look at now... but wait till they start treading in your wife's flower patch!!
441765,TJQ,2010-03-09 14:22:00,7806,Very cool Lew Ya should put some oats or something out for them.. we feed the rabbits so we can watch them in the morning!!
441766,Marty,2010-03-09 14:24:00,873,.. . and have them for lunch?
441769,lew,2010-03-09 14:30:00,12766," Nothings changed Norm, I've been up since 2:30 A.M., it's the deer that are the sleepyheads around these parts  And TJ, the neighbor puts out a couple pails of grain twice a day and it's like ringing the dinner bell for these guys."
441792,TJQ,2010-03-09 15:37:00,7806,Ya...  ummm... when your up before the deer... umm.....  i think its time for an intervention...

442318,irishfield,2010-03-10 23:49:00,26272,It is indeed a great way to start the morning Lew... but to be a stickler.. you neighbour isn't doing the deer any favours feeding them.
442326,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-11 00:02:00,0,Geeezzzz...fresh jerky right outside the door and a nice garage to hang it in....
442341,lew,2010-03-11 00:28:00,12766, Afraid I don't have any say over what the neighbors do Wayne
