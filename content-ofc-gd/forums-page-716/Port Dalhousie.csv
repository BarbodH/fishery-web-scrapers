441632,solopaddler,2010-03-09 03:04:00,8605,It's wide open no problem.
441634,muskieb,2010-03-09 03:06:00,58,Thanks! Hopefully the weather cooperates for Wednesday.
441636,Pigeontroller,2010-03-09 03:08:00,2793,The docks might not be there...Makes it tough to launch alone.
441647,solopaddler,2010-03-09 03:36:00,8605,"There's one dock in the water, you'll be good to go."
