441897,Headhunter,2010-03-09 20:41:00,5703,"That's funny Terry, because I get all kinds of email that clearly states that they can help me grow 3 inches in a couple of weeks... at a mimimal charge! Now all is clear! HH"
441900,Terry,2010-03-09 20:59:00,14456,oh I am glad to hear that I thought they were targeting me with those ads .....LOL
441905,ch312,2010-03-09 21:11:00,1590,"i am totally against causing harm to someone....unless they deserve it  the steel pipe beside the hole sounds like a great idea to me. idiots that come zipping by continue to do so because its nearly impossible to punish them for their idiotic actions. ruining a few sleds without causing harm to the drivers would be ideal and word of it would spread like wildfire. next thing you know ice fishermen are no longer losing gear or getting headaches from these morons because they fear there is a trap.  sure it sounds ridiculous, but so does zipping by 20ft away from ice huts and fishermen going 120km/h. the only way to fight stupid is to lower yourself to their level."
441907,northshore,2010-03-09 21:21:00,13,"experienced this quite a bit this winter out on Simcoe, purposly buzzing just feet from your portable hut, making it shake. Just dangerous, if they loss control - they can kill you, not to mention some of us have kids out there. Just plain shelf-fish and stupid. thought about this dilema and saw some 'yellow caution tape' at dollarama - haven't done it yet - but maybe stake out an area 20'x20' around your hut, lines and fishing area with some tape and spikes - sounds crazy but we will probably come to this... BTW also saw mini pilons at dollarama - but not sure they will work - probably make them buzz closer to you - i think they get off on stupiity - so much open area and they purposely speed by the fisher ppl."
441929,Dano,2010-03-09 22:43:00,719," Oh yea, thats right, sorry, forgot about you....thanks for the reminder, ummmm yea, cant wait!  3 inches Joe? Dont do it, you're tall enough already. Yea, its time....."
441938,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-09 23:04:00,0,"because of this, and because we were on a busy lake this weekend, i put my auger down in front of the tip up.   if someone wants to run that over on their modified arctic cat be my guest."
441941,archie_james_c,2010-03-09 23:10:00,618,  Hey...we all know you Steelheaders are the snobbiest anglers out there...   
441948,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-09 23:15:00,0,"  you think float guys are bad, you should talk to some of the snobby speycasters!  they intentionally use a method which catches less fish just to feel good about themselves!"
442052,Dara,2010-03-10 02:24:00,3052,  ya..k...I use a flyrod
440257,icceman,2010-03-05 17:52:00,36,"About 5 to 7 years ago i had some idiots on sleds run over my tip ups.  Not knowing that they were made of 3/8 rebar and 1/4"" round stock.  To there amaze it went into the track ripping the crap out of everything in there. Guess who got towed home.  Guess what goes around comes around."
440295,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-05 20:24:00,10439,"  Sweet!!!! But aren't they heavy?  A bunch of fence wire works good too. At least I know it stops a dirt bike pretty good. Some one had tossed a bunch away on the side of the trails my buddy and I used to ride. That stuff is a major pain to get out once it's wrapped around everything. Just don't forget to take it with you when you leave.  Another good one is to pack all the wet snow and slush into a bucket and pack it down. Then flip the bucket over and remove the slug, just like building sand castles. Stick the slug in front of your hole. At the end of the day stick the slug in the hole.  The paintball solution sounds good too."
440302,trophypikehunter,2010-03-05 20:47:00,89,"Thanks guys for the advice but I think I might buy some bright orange construction pylons, I want to catch fish not an assault charge  :lol"
440655,POLLIWOGG,2010-03-06 16:00:00,835,I though everybody carries phones with cameras on them these days. Bad guys are usually camera shy.
440711,462Liquid,2010-03-06 20:38:00,12,"yea, thats pretty idiotic... i NEVER go anywhere near people when im on the ice. i stay far away and if the need rises to go by people i do so slowly and carefully. i would go retarded if someone ever did that to me hahaha!"
441086,Dano,2010-03-07 19:15:00,719," xeon, such a shame your vast intelligence and keen insight is being wasted on us here. Why dont you hit the road and look for an audience that would be more your intellectual equal. I kindly suggest you start recruiting here.    Take your vitriol elswhere."
441088,Dara,2010-03-07 19:21:00,3052,We need open water and summer. There are a bunch of people in here with a severe case of Cabin fever
441190,fishhunter,2010-03-07 23:26:00,604,lmao!!!!
441196,archie_james_c,2010-03-07 23:44:00,618,  I make sure to keep atleast a few hundred yards away when possible. When I'm fishing on the ice I don't appreciate guys zipping buy on a noisy machine...kinda ruins the moment.  Oh wait...that's why I fish the park...
441200,brifishrgy,2010-03-07 23:54:00,559,  I would take his advise xeon .. it has worked for him and it could work for you

TO ALL SLEDDERS, SLOW THE YOU KNOW WHAT DOWN!!!!!IF YOU WANT TO GO ALL OUT THEN FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GO! IF YOU WANT TO RACE THEN GO TO PUSLINCH LAKE,THEY DRAG RACE OUT THERE, AND ITS A PLEASURE TO WATCH THEM WHILE ICEFISHING. Sorry Guys,I had to get it out."
441257,Terry,2010-03-08 01:43:00,14456,found this I think it applies

441273,Terry,2010-03-08 02:26:00,14456,it's amazing what you can find on google..I'm just saying......LOL
441305,xeon,2010-03-08 03:50:00,350," I do remember a Weird Science article years ago about chimps actually having far superior simple math skills than humans. So thank you sir, and I appreciate your subtle compliments.  BTW, how did you know I was great at math?"

441712,Dano,2010-03-09 10:58:00,719, Your obsession with me is getting a little creepy there guy.......
441894,brifishrgy,2010-03-09 20:25:00,559,  thats funny .. in your last pm you mentioned you look forward to meeting me
441896,Terry,2010-03-09 20:34:00,14456,"Thank god for the anonymity of the internet, it makes people grow about 3""and makes them UFC champs"

440022,Kilka,2010-03-05 01:55:00,17,"Not much you can do other than wrap your tip up base in orange trail marking tape.  Idiots are going to be idiots, what can you do."
440036,cheaptackle,2010-03-05 02:13:00,849,"What about one of those whip poles with a flag on it like you see on kids bikes?  I agree you shouldn't have too, but it may save a tip up from getting crunched.  Michael"
440037,anders,2010-03-05 02:13:00,1168,"attach it to some TNT, or make a jump behind it, so when they do go through....they get some good air  sorry...long day!"

440040,Terry,2010-03-05 02:23:00,14456,"I have a 2"" auger for drilling  a small hole beside my tipup and I insert a 2"" steel pipe that sticks up about a foot, if they run over my tipup they destroy their sled, now that I think of it maybe I should put a small flag on t so they can see it"
440058,Dara,2010-03-05 03:15:00,3052,"  thats a real good idea...set a trap to hurt somebody  sorry that they run into yoyr stuff pikehunter. sometimes stuff like that can be hard to see, and some people are just disrespectfull. I do doubt that any sledder purposely runs into a line though...it would make a heck of a mess wound into a track. perhaps a bit more orange tape would help"
440070,bow slayer,2010-03-05 03:51:00,1074,"I have been witness a few times where the sledders were purposely running over tip-ups on nipissing. My buddy had a few destroyed. Then he found a solution. He took out his paint ball gun and when the jackass ran over a set up he was waiting and unloaded the gun while the ""sledder"" went past,never had a problem since."
440088,xeon,2010-03-05 04:41:00,350, That will teach that dam father of four not to run over your tip-ups. Haha enjoy your wheelchair suckaaa!
440092,Joey,2010-03-05 04:49:00,9122," I seriously doubt it is the father's of 4 who are out zipping around like that oblivious to others ""space"" on the ice. ....and I'm pretty sure Terry was only stating what he'd LIKE to do.  I'm with him on that one.  People need to learn respect for personal property and space in this world.  There is far too much selfishness and idiocy out there.  Wish there was a fine for stupidity"
440101,xeon,2010-03-05 05:23:00,350, Some people just like to break things.

440106,fish-miester,2010-03-05 06:09:00,864,some sledders can get pretty annoying sometimes. me and two other friends were fishing on Scugog the other day and were fishing in a line no bigger then 10 feet next to one of my friends quad.. and we look over and there are 2 sleds blasting down the lake heading straight at us.. and closing in fast.. so we waved our arms to make sure they see us.. and what do they do.. keep the throttle pinned.. and missed us by 3 feet.. and clipped my back pack.. boy was I pissed off .. and i told my two friends if they were to come back something was going to happen.. stayed out a couple hours after .. but they did not return..
440111,ohhenrygsr,2010-03-05 06:33:00,947, That's awesome the colder the day the better the paintballs get's
440123,Terry,2010-03-05 10:19:00,14456,"yeah I think just maybe I was joking....I have a 10"" auger, don't know if there is anything like a 2"" auger......."
440125,xeon,2010-03-05 11:04:00,350," I've read of Americans actually doing that, so I wouldn't put it past someone who fishes Simcoe."
440126,Jer,2010-03-05 11:27:00,1426,   ...damn Americans...
440163,Kerry,2010-03-05 13:30:00,383,"First, there is absolutely no reason to be running at speed within a few feet of anyone or a hut on the lake.Snow and ice conditions can make your sled buck sideways in a flash.It's a huge area to play on on any lake. Therefore I will grab my auger sideways and stand facing them if they wanna charge at me.I have a right to safety just as anyone else and noone is gonna play games with my life or stuff for that matter. No different than the idiots that will run at you while fishing from the boat minding your own business. Kerry Oh yeah, I like Terry's idea too.Leave the orange flag off tie a rope from it to the tip up and call it a backup safety for big pike that take the whole setup down the hole (happens all the time!)  and make it just short enough to ruin a track and see how they like it."
440168,Headhunter,2010-03-05 13:52:00,5703,Try this next time they are coming at you! I bet they turn! http://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://...ved=0CBYQ9QEwAw HH
440178,ecmilley,2010-03-05 14:15:00,2163,one of the problems on sturgeon where ice fishing is allowed for the first time is the sleds have been running at speed for years and years over the same areas and now we have some huts put up and ice fisherman not covering there old holes before they leave leaving a hardened slush bump which at the very least is good for a spine tingler at worst i seen one sled get written off this year. The best advice is know before you go. i always do a slow tour of the lake to see where everyone is and any hazards on the ice before i giver er
440206,Dara,2010-03-05 15:22:00,3052,"Again, I guess we are sheltered up here.  I never would have thought any body would do stuff like that. I guess when the population gets high enough that you get a higher number of idiots and they start to show up more.  You really shouldn't have to arm yourself with a paintball gun to go fishing"

Pretty sure you'd have trouble convincing the court your ice hole is your castle, even in southern Fla.  JF"
440222,Meegs,2010-03-05 16:14:00,249,"ive had it happen more than once!    I remember afew years ago up near huntsville we were sitting back watching the lines when 2 sledders i guess thought it would be hilarious to boot right beside us and take out 3 of our lines.   completely destroyed one of my fav rod and reel combo's and one of my buddies tip ups got caught in one of there skis and ended up whereever the sledders decided to stop!  Woulda loved to have seen one of there sleds break down, they woulda been in for a beating of there lives!  Absolutly no respect out there for some people's stuff."
440223,anders,2010-03-05 16:19:00,1168, Dont kid yourself Dara...up here on some of the lakes close to town its happened on more than one occasion.  Lack of common sense doesnt stop at a particular area....its spread out pretty good.
440228,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-05 16:37:00,0,"  agreed.  it's not that sledders and tip ups don't mix, it's that idiots and snowmachines don't mix.  i usually drive AROUND guys fishing out of courtesy...  i don't even want to scare their fish let alone run over their gear."
