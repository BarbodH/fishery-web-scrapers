441459,Roy,2010-03-08 19:53:00,13728,"Was out in the yard this morning and caught  a glimpse of a large bird out the corner of my eye. it landed two neighbours' yards down. Got the camera...kneeling in the slush, poking through a cedar hedge. OK, enough excuses, it's a bad shot. It was having breakfast.....rodent under claw.  "
441465,ChrisK,2010-03-08 20:09:00,2772,Good shot Roy considering all. One less mouse you got to worry about
441467,Joey,2010-03-08 20:19:00,9122,Beauty  They are such majestic birds eh!!!  Nice shot hon!  Joey
441520,irishfield,2010-03-08 23:10:00,26272,Tell us why you were really in your neighbours back yard !!!
441524,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-08 23:17:00,1362," Ya Roy, and why you were kneeling in the slush, poking through a cedar hedge"
441531,MJL,2010-03-08 23:31:00,2427,Cool picture Roy.  The last couple years I've been seeing more and more hawks in my neighbourhood.  Looks like it could be a Coopers hawk.  Here's a thread I started about IDing a similar looking hawk I found in my neighbour's yard (front yard instead   ) .  Hawk in the yard thread
441536,Roy,2010-03-08 23:47:00,13728,"Mine's a Cooper's, Mike...I can't ID yours but there are lots of folks here who should be able to.  And to the others, I wasn't in my neighbour's yard....I was in mine, two yards away."
441548,irishfield,2010-03-09 00:12:00,26272, Yah.. okay Roy.. I forgot that J reads the forum now and then !
441557,bucktail,2010-03-09 00:27:00,1857,Sharp Shinned I think!
441590,Ron,2010-03-09 01:27:00,1683," Probably checking up on his Lobsters.  Nice looking bird Roy. I would have to guess it being a Coopers Hawk if you are wanting to know what it is....   Cheers, Ron..."
441714,lew,2010-03-09 11:23:00,12766,Great pic of a beautiful bird Roy !!  I had one of them kill and devour a pigeon in my yard a couple years back and there was nothing left but some blood and the 2 wings.
441776,4thgen,2010-03-09 14:50:00,157,"It is definately a Cooper's or a Sharp-Shinned Hawk. Hard to really tell in that picture though. You describing it as a large bird definately points towards Coopers despite some chance of size overlap. They will eat mice but if you or your neighbour has a bird feeder, you are perhaps unwittingly supplying food to two levels of that food chain! The long rudder-like tail and the short stubby wings make them very manueverable and excellent bird catchers."
441791,TJQ,2010-03-09 15:36:00,7806,Lew... pigeon wings are tough!! everyone knows that!!  yuk....
441815,Harrison,2010-03-09 16:20:00,2202, Probably could of sold them to Hooters.
