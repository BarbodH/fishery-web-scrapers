441655,GBW,2010-03-09 03:53:00,8460,Bring a cordless drill with you and the longest drill bit you can find.  Then drill every 5' to see how thick it is.  Best bet on any ice you don't know is to be safe.

441754,bigugli,2010-03-09 13:41:00,6138,"In late season, ice thickness is no guarantee of safety. As spring progresses, the ice begins to honeycomb, turns white, pockets and voids develop below the surface. Float coats, walking sticks and ice picks should be standard gear."
441779,jayess,2010-03-09 15:00:00,187,"thanks guys. with the upcoming rain in the area, how does this affect the ice? it seems at this point that temps are still dropping to around freezing at night, +/- a degree or two.  new to all of this, so I appreciate the input from experienced folks."
441781,bigugli,2010-03-09 15:04:00,6138,After 2-3 days of rain runoff and warm the shoreline ice will break up quickly
