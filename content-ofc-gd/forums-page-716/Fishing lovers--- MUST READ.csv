442212,grt1,2010-03-10 18:46:00,638,it would be interesting to see if the ontario tourism industry is supporting this!!!!!
442218,Toronto_Angler,2010-03-10 18:53:00,698,I think everyone is overreacting to this. There is no way fishing will be banned. This whole thing has been taken out of context.

442228,bowshep,2010-03-10 19:28:00,378,"WWF and not the wrestling group is involved in this, you know the same people that worked on getting the ban on the spring bear hunt. So don't think for a second that they do not have power.  Ken"

It's just that there is a tremendous amount of bias of this being a conservative website and referring to the US government as the Obama White House.  Also I seriously don't see them closing down a multi billion dollar industry, especially in this economy."

442388,timmeh,2010-03-11 02:00:00,609,  I took this from the other post here regarding this issue. You may want to read it before you go selling your fishing gear.  http://www.examiner.com/x-37128-Charlotte-...-to-ban-fishing
