122510,nelly,2007-10-11 15:55:00,256,I was doing a search for a movie called the swordsman with Jet Li and somehow came across a related field called the romantic swordsman. I don't know what the words or music is about but I thought it sound nice. Anyone else have other foreign music that may sound interesting?

122517,swiebe,2007-10-11 16:07:00,18,My favourite foreign music is the soundtrack from Akira.  It's japanese but it's not really a 'normal' musical style of Japan - Akira was sci-fi and the soundtrack was really different.

Maybe a little too heavy for most but great music while pumping Iron.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm2eT-sTVys http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w9EksAo5hY...ted&search= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbZa_9BnMOw...ted&search=
