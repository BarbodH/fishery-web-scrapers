122617,darsky,2007-10-11 23:23:00,586,"Got out on Wed for a half day to enjoy some awesome Fall weather and hot Fall action before 3 days of rain set in. Was on the water by 11 am and was trolling by 11:15. Water was flat calm with nary a ripple and nary a bite for 2 hrs so out came the tubes and a casting we went. Mid lake sand patches and rock/weed areas were still holding fish even tho' the calender confirmed it was indeed October 10. These fish ""should"" be out to the depths by now but luckily for us all they are still around and hungry. Any hooked bass brought up a school of buddies and it was quite easy to double up. We picked of a half dz up to 4 lbs in the blink of an eye. In another blink they were gone. Decided to drop some lumber down and troll. Sure enough a zinging sound confirmed there was at least one muskie in the lake that day. After a nice tussle a very pretty St Lawrence spottie was aboard. She measured around 45 inches and must have been in the 23-25 lb range. Switched it back up to smallies and fished a shallow sand flat that dropped sharply into the abyss. Another pod was hanging off the drop and 4-5 chunkies tasted steel. Headed back to the launch around 4:30 to end a spectacular mid week day. As usual-pics to follow.   "
