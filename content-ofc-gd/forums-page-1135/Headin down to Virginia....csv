122552,icefisherman,2007-10-11 19:06:00,952," Well unfortunately you are right...almost no seelection in Canada and very limited one in US as I've found out myself on the type of boat I am looking for. Hope it changes in the next few weeks as weather gets colder. Good luck with your search.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
122564,jedimaster,2007-10-11 19:40:00,3472,"Lookingt o buy a bass boat style Fish n Ski. Not a bowrider thats been converted(Been there), Need a shallow draft bassboat, that just happens to have seating for 5 or 6, either a bench seat and two jump seats in front ortwo captains chairs and a bench behind. Lots in the states, but none in Canada. Lots of Bass boats but they only seat 2 and unless my wife divorces me I am not allowed to have a boat for 2.  Not too worried, although I was all ready to go, been looking for a while and am ready to pull the trigger on the right boat for the right price. They are tough sells in the states because most guys want all out bass boat with as much deck space as possible, I am willing to give up the deck space for a few extra seats.  A Bowrider is too deep of a draft for where I will be fishing. So that kinda limits me. Procraft, Stratus, Tracker and Cajun are the models I am looking at."
122583,Daplumma,2007-10-11 20:40:00,1961,Here is one a few miles from my house.Dunno if this is what you are looking for. http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/boa/426805138.html

122683,KyleM,2007-10-12 06:46:00,218,"Isnt Falcon trying to sell a procraft in the classifieds.....  It sounds close to what you are searching for.  The price is right to, suprised its still for sale."
122541,jedimaster,2007-10-11 17:54:00,3472,NOpe can't get one til next week. Gonna pass. I am a big believer in the snowball effect. If one thing goes wrong many things that follow usually do. Will keep looking.
122546,Daplumma,2007-10-11 18:24:00,1961,If you are looking for cheap boats try Craigslist.You can check out different cities and may find a better deal closer to home.Good luck. Joe
122547,Terry,2007-10-11 18:24:00,14456,that's too bad but maybe it's a good thing in the long run...keep looking
122550,jedimaster,2007-10-11 18:46:00,3472,"Yah I have a few other leads, just waiting for the exact right type of boat. Not many around that suit what I want....None in canada. They aren't popular up here. Will keep looking. Yah imo if something triggers off negative its time to step back right away before something else goes wrong. I have been caught up in snowballs before."
