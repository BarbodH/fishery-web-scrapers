I have only fished from the pier for salmon during it's staging and during it's main runs.  Are there other type of fish that I can target from the pier followed by salmon fishing season ?  Brown trouts? Steelhead? Do people still fish from the pier for these trouts? If so,,, which months of the year can I fish for them from the pier?  Would I continue using the same lures I used for salmon ?  I would appreciate some informations.   Thank you!"
