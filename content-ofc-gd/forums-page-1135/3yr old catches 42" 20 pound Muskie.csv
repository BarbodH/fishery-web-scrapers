Nicolas Phillips recently reeled in a 42-inch muskie.<BR><BR>  His parents say that fishing is one of the few things that will calm down the rambunctious 3-year-old. <BR><BR>  ""He doesn't get bored until around two hours go by,"" said Kelly Phillips, Nicolas' mom. <BR><BR> In the final minutes of a father-son fishing trip this weekend, Nicolas pulled in a catch worthy of any angler. <BR><BR> ""I catched a big one!"" Nicolas said, arms up showing just how big. <BR><BR> It was a 42-inch, 20-pound monster of a muskie, caught on the same pole the tireless tot now casts into branches in his backyard. <BR><BR> ""He said 'Dad, I have a fish,'"" said Nicolas' dad Wesley Phillips. ""I could see the bobber next to the boat, and I waited for him to pull in the little fish. Then, I looked down and it was a big muskie."" <BR><BR> Wesley wasn't really ready to reel in a fish the same size as his son. <BR><BR> The pole he was using was small, and was sporting a six pound test line. <BR><BR> Lucky for the father-son team, some nearby boaters lent them a hand and a net. <BR><BR> Nicolas knows where his muskie is headed. <BR><BR> ""It's dead, we're gonna put it on the wall in our house,"" Nicolas said. <BR><BR>  NBC <BR><BR>  <embed src=""http://www.liveleak.com/player.swf"" width=""450"" height=""370"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" pluginspage=""http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"" flashvars=""autostart=false&token=1a4_1192148992"" scale=""showall"" name=""index""></embed>"
122771,Terry,2007-10-12 13:37:00,14456,it's a great story  but to me it looks about 36 inch. long and 10lbs
122772,ccmtcanada,2007-10-12 13:41:00,7971, It's the exchange rate....this was a US story....LOL
122777,Bly,2007-10-12 13:53:00,1556,Hey Cliff...Syd just watched this and wants to know when we can go fishing again??
122779,fishnsled,2007-10-12 14:01:00,3520,"Well here's a 44 inch muskie that I caught recently and weighted in at 17 pounds.    And this one was 46"" and weighted in at 20.5 pounds.      You maybe close on your guessimate Terry.  I was going to be generous and give it a 15+or- pound weight but it does look shorter then 42"".  Hard to tell with the fish curled up. Great to see the little guy getting a fish of that size though!  Cliff, you're too funny!  lol!"
122799,b2kptbo,2007-10-12 15:06:00,1505,Great story Cliff...
122803,bassmastermike,2007-10-12 15:21:00,295,That was a great story!! Props out to the little guy!
122821,camillj,2007-10-12 16:28:00,1988,Yea I saw that on MSN yesterday ... too bad the last shot of the curled up dried out musky on the pickup truck bed was'nt a release shot ... oh well the kid's definitely hooked now
122832,fatherof3,2007-10-12 16:58:00,1769,"nice story,good for him"
122852,Rizzo,2007-10-12 17:20:00,4754,"Better not let my 3 year old see that, he's always asking to go fishing so he can catch a ""big pike"".  Naturally his idea of big pike is the ever-so-plentiful snotrocket which we can catch every few minutes.  If he gets hooked on musky (like his dad) we'll never see mom."
122935,ch312,2007-10-12 22:30:00,1590," and the problem with that is....  people always have to rag on someones catch. seriously, why bother bickering oh i think its this long or that long or mine was this big. who cares? thats a nice fish for anyone let alone a little kid"
122937,Terry,2007-10-12 22:48:00,14456,"who is bickering  I was stating what I believe to be a fact......the fish is not the stated  size this was a second hand story...if the kid or his family posted it, I would not say a word  but it seems it is you coming on and bickering or stirring the pot"
122949,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-13 00:31:00,1183,Cute...and now Dad has to put out some $$$ to get it on the wall. lol   Should have got him hot wheels instead.
122969,fishindevil,2007-10-13 03:08:00,6254,Well its still a big fish for a little guy like him.  ...so at least he will remember that forever.....
122982,Marc Thorpe,2007-10-13 12:32:00,621,What trully fishing is about The age of innocense
