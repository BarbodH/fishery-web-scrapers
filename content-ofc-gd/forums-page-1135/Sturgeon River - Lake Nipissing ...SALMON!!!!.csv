122838,walleyejigger,2007-10-12 17:07:00,876,"there's always been a story in my family of my uncle catching one, in sturgeon no less about 15-18 years ago now, but we never really belived him as no one else saw it and no pics, this brings a little more validity to his story"
122946,Muskieman,2007-10-12 23:46:00,2472,YES IT WAS KEPT!!!  would you want an invasive .. non native species introduced in your fishing hole? who know what kind of damage this could do to Nips ecosystem???  I would'nt care if it were out of season{ yes i did say that }   ... that fish WAS NOT going back into the water.. If we catch another it will be treated as a GOBY or A RUSTY CRAYFISH.  In anyother circomstance I abide by the regs  to the letter...but in this case screw the regs.  I've talked to my C/O buddies     Rick N  and   Bill C.  and they agree with me....  p.s..   that fish was given to Richard  a Biologist at the MNR office in North Bay for examination...
122953,Garyv,2007-10-13 00:49:00,547,Salmon have a five year life cycle..from the colour that fish is on it's last few days and will die anyway.  Personally it's  colour is beyond what I would eat in a spawning fish but to each his own.
122955,Guest skeeter99,2007-10-13 01:03:00,0,"the salmon are not invasive to lake nipissing  they used to come up through the french, before dams and barriers as such  they are even listed as a fish in the lake according to the lake nipisiing stewardship council  http://www.lnsc.ca/lake_nipissing.asp?site...name=Fish+Types  i just got to find the article about the salmon that used to run up to nipissing cannot find , pretty sure it was in ontario outdoors magazine a few years ago in light of a couple being caught during the winter"

123015,mcallister.grant,2007-10-13 15:25:00,327,Interesting.... I have seen a picture at a local bait shop of a brown trout that was caught in Buckhorn Lake.
121959,Muskieman,2007-10-09 23:27:00,2472,"NO This was'nt  bought at A&P..  Once every 15 years or so a Salmon is caught in downtown Sturgeon Falls.. now keep in mind that  the Sturgeon River is the largest tributary to Lake Nipissing .. and so on to the French River and down to Georgian Bay..this Salmon travelled on hell of a ways to get here... they say Salmon return to their place of birth.. do you think that he was born here?  This specimen weighed in at 9 1/2 lbs, and was caught in 2 feet of water using a rapala ..in Downtown Sturgeon Falls..  My buddy the lucky angler did'nt want his face made public...  There are yearly reports of Native Netters Catching them in their nets... they also catch Rainbow and even the odd Laker and Spec.  There is'nt a fishable resource in the lake for such fish..but maybe someday there will be one.."
121960,Clampet,2007-10-09 23:29:00,1947,Huh! Whooda thunk it?
121989,Muskieman,2007-10-10 00:16:00,2472,"Oh ,   I assumed that this is a Chinook am I right....?  sorry I'm not a Salmon kind of guy."
121991,irishfield,2007-10-10 00:17:00,26272,"Met a guy at the Temagami town dock this summer that told me he caught a Salmon on NIppisssing, thru the ice, a couple years back and made Ontario Out Doors or similar with that one."
121992,Clampet,2007-10-10 00:17:00,1947,"Whatever it is, it is not considered native to Lake Nipissing."
121994,Rizzo,2007-10-10 00:19:00,4754,I've heard of this happening in Nipissing.  fish sure had to swim through some interesting waters to get where it did!
121997,Muskieman,2007-10-10 00:22:00,2472,True.... i figured it out it probably traveled 150-80 miles to get here  ... I just read on the net that 90% chance that  he's not alone.. and that there probably another 5-10 there following a much bigger female.... now the question is will they reproduce ... ?
122023,Dano,2007-10-10 01:28:00,719,"I hope they dont reproduce, who knows how they would affect the Nippissing fishery as a whole."
122027,mattyk,2007-10-10 01:38:00,2110,i have seen pictures of other salmon from lake nip.
122038,scuro,2007-10-10 02:20:00,386,Who is yellow head?
122045,drwxr,2007-10-10 02:50:00,453,its the guy from wallmart :):) 
122050,Joey,2007-10-10 03:03:00,9122,"That is one black salmon.  Thanks for sharing, pretty cool.  Joey"
122067,Musky or Specks,2007-10-10 04:13:00,2710,Yep we see them all the time in the French when we are musky fishing. Kinda cool that occasionally they get up that far. Makes me think about all the times I've seen steelhead in New Hamburg and think wow that fish has come a long way.
122088,solopaddler,2007-10-10 09:12:00,8605,I remember reading about that one caught through the ice. That's truly incredible what that fish traversed to get there.
122130,ccmtcanada,2007-10-10 13:19:00,7971,What an incredible journey for that guy!!!
122185,LeXXington,2007-10-10 15:49:00,1928,"intresting.,, wrong turn or taking a tour"
122235,lunkerbasshunter,2007-10-10 18:15:00,2585,every year there seems to be a case or to where someone has caught salmon or rainbow trout our of nipissing.  sure would be an interesting journey to find out where they came from  Cheers!
122240,tonyb,2007-10-10 18:32:00,1637,"Wow, it must have come from Georgian bay, up the French, across Nipissing and then up to Sturgeon Falls....at least 100KM by water I would think. Amazing..."
122242,ccmtcanada,2007-10-10 18:35:00,7971,"You just know the fish is saying  ""I knew I should have taken that right turn at Albuquerque""  hehe."
122298,Muskieman,2007-10-10 21:30:00,2472,LOL
122304,highdrifter,2007-10-10 21:45:00,2534,No way!  I used to fish at that very spot as a kid...  That's definetly a chini too.  Bizarre! HD
122308,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-10 22:21:00,1183, He's following the female Run girl run!!!!!!
122503,fishindevil,2007-10-11 15:38:00,6254,"WOW...thats an epic journey !!!!!!!   man thats sure along ways from georgian bay....im  surprised that he didnt swim up one of the smaller tributarys on the french way further downstream.....well you got to give him credit,great catch and i bet he got the shock of his life when he seen it was a salmon...thanks for sharing....cheers"
122695,Photoz,2007-10-12 08:59:00,792,Just curious . . . . .  .    after ripping it's gills with that typa hold . . . . .   was the fish released?
122818,ecmilley,2007-10-12 16:17:00,2163,"I kind of find this offensive, someone catches a salmon where they shouldn't have and someone has to find a negative twist to put on it, looking at the pic myself it would seem clear that the fish was kept and probably bound for a smoker( mmm tasty salmon) it's simple comments like these that get flame wars going"
