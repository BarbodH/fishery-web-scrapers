122166,ccmtcanada,2007-10-10 14:44:00,7971, I called them on the weekend...they are still there but completely booked.
122169,Headhunter,2007-10-10 14:46:00,5703,Drove through Picton a couple of weeks ago and it sure looked like the Tip of the Bay was open and doing a brisk business. Perhaps those who need a place could look into it. They have docks for their customers right outside the hotel and are reasonably priced. HH
122171,Hooked,2007-10-10 14:47:00,891," I was by there last December and the rumour was that it was closed down, and it looked like it too.  Thats good to know that its still up and running."
122216,corvette1,2007-10-10 17:34:00,1765,tip of the bay closed nov or dec last for vacation my boat was at the tip of the bay docked my truck was running headlights aimed at my lund-prov someone stole over 4000 dollers wirth  of gps rods tackle i was in my truck at the time boaters beware leave nothing in your boat
122263,LeXXington,2007-10-10 19:31:00,1928,The TIP took our reservations last year and called us a week before then said sorry about your luck were closing early.
122398,bassmastermike,2007-10-11 05:57:00,295,Thanks Lady Walleye Yahoo I got a couch to crash on!!!!!
122626,Shelley Cooper,2007-10-11 23:52:00,394,Your welcome BMMike...  From all of US in cabin #10
122716,misfish,2007-10-12 11:31:00,29133,"Hey Shell,nice tan line.  There was reports of low water out there folks. Some hitting unmarked rocks. Some launches un useable. Be safe and have a great time out there."
122128,ccmtcanada,2007-10-10 13:15:00,7971,  Yep...it's true...at least be nice and give him a nice lawn chair.  
122165,Hooked,2007-10-10 14:43:00,891,  I thought they closed down the Sportsman Motel?
120929,Gerritt,2007-10-05 17:42:00,6129,"I called up Merland some time ago and booked a cottage for the upcoming Quinte G2G.. I spoke with Kevin who took my reservation, He asked me to give him a call back once I knew how many boats we would be bringing up. I called them this week only to be told that we indeed did not have a cottage booked as the cottage they promised us was already rented out for that weekend..  They did try to make things right by offering us a cottage five kilometers down the road...it is a nice cottage.. however they are removing the docks.. so we have nowhere to dock our boats.. now I am looking at Launching in and out Everyday, not being able to hang out and have a couple beers with the guys (Drinking and Driving) etc... Basically I am having to drive to do anything at all...  Is it wrong for me to be upset here?  there are alot of us going to Merland's somehow this just does not seem right to me.....   If any of you have booked with Merland's I would call to VERIFY your reservation or you might be looking at the same situation I am faced with now..  Looking for suggestions here guys..  Gerritt."
120932,irishfield,2007-10-05 17:45:00,26272,Sorry to hear Gerritt. Doesn't help you but why I do it by email..I have my confirmation letter.  I also don't drink..so within reason I could shuttle for you to partak in the festivities if needed.
120934,Terry,2007-10-05 17:48:00,14456,"I would say that everyone should check and tell Kevin that we are upset that Gerritt lost his cottage..that he was one of the one getting it going this year and now he has to be somewhere else......   and you have every right to be upset  man that sucks...how many people in your group..maybe it would be possible to break the group up and get into cottages with the other people, each year a few back out at the last minute ....it really sucks"
120935,Joey,2007-10-05 17:50:00,9122,"Well how many are in your cabin Gerritt.  Maybe if all of us who have cabins takes one person, you'll all have a place.  I'm willing to put up with you if my other roomies don't mind  Just a suggestion.  Joey"
120938,douG,2007-10-05 17:53:00,2693,"Did you receive a confirmation from Merland, Gerritt?  Did they take your deposit?  Regardless, I always bring a sleeping mattress and airbed with me on these trips.  You are welcome to bunk with Dawg and me."
120941,oldphart,2007-10-05 17:55:00,665,"~~~I have booked  one of the motel rooms they have for me and buddy Slug,  and sent them a money order, for a deposit, I'll be calling to night to make sure I got it"
120943,BITEME,2007-10-05 17:57:00,1969,i willing to put someone or two up im sure percher has no problem i usually sleep on the floor or a couch anyway
120952,SlowPoke,2007-10-05 18:18:00,2984,"Ripple effect... I too was booked at Chateau Gerritt and am now homeless. I have Bly and GCD (I think?) riding in my boat and these Merlands folks have also shattered thier dreams. Okay, maybe I'm laying it on too thick. I'm still up for the trip if someone is able to confirm some room. I don't take up much room if I sleep standing up! -Brian"
120958,Joey,2007-10-05 18:26:00,9122,"Okay, I have a PM fired off to my roomies at BOQ and if its okay with them we can take one or two of you homeless people in  I'll confirm when I hear back from them.  I can't very well say its okay unless they agree also.   Cheers,  Joey"
120960,Badger Shark,2007-10-05 18:28:00,291,"That is unfortunate.  This is one of the reasons we will not book at Merlands again.  We were supposed to have a cottage last year, we got one of the postage sized "" motel rooms "" and they charged my credit card an extra 50 bucks which I never got back.  I could have pursued this but I just decided to forget it and stay other places.  We will be staying in Belleville probably with it costing much less money.  Ssorry if this is to negative but it was really unpleasant.  And Kevin gave my buddy a hard time asa well when he asked him where he could buy a downrigger ball.  Good luck to everyone and I am looking forward to your reports and we will be heading there the weekend of Oct.20th, we booked a day with Eye-Tracker on the Sat. and are going out on my boat Sun."
120964,huntervasili,2007-10-05 18:31:00,1604,Well I know our cottage still has room in it...so maybe it isn't a bad Idea to break up that group... I can sleep on the floor... doesn't bug me...
120967,Gerritt,2007-10-05 18:33:00,6129,Bill willing to take my fat arse in?  G.
120969,Gerritt,2007-10-05 18:34:00,6129,Thanks for all the suggestions and offering of places to sleep! you guys rock!  Gerritt.
120973,Bitsmith2k,2007-10-05 18:55:00,396, i gotta blow up bed i'll bring up there if its needed..
120974,irishfield,2007-10-05 18:56:00,26272," Brian...we can put you in with us if you need a spot. I  have either #4 or #12..we'll see when we get there Thursday the 15th. I am going to bring a single blow up bed as well, just to have in the truck, in case we need it in addition to the 2 bedrooms and couch. It's me, Dano and Terry at this point and we can flip coins for who's sleepin on what.  I'll PM you my cell so you have it to find us when the time comes.  Sound's like Gerritt's found a home...who else is homeless?  Wayne"
120977,LeXXington,2007-10-05 18:57:00,1928,"Well I always stay at the Picton Harbour Inn, fishing outside of your door. Easy access to town.  Not that Merland park and me have any indifference, I just like the location of town"
120985,Gerritt,2007-10-05 19:06:00,6129,"  Grant.B.McAllister, Vatordude and VatorDudes Son.  Gerritt."

120990,SlowPoke,2007-10-05 19:15:00,2984," Thanks Wayne, count me in. Thanks again to all offering! -Brian"
120994,oldphart,2007-10-05 19:28:00,665,"~~~Like I said I have one of the Motel rooms, may be small with another person, but as long as I have a clear path to the Throne room I see no problem with a 3rd person.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~I usuall stay at the Lake On The Mountain Cottages 2 min.s from the ferry dock"
121001,fishnsled,2007-10-05 19:53:00,3520,You've got a pm.

121028,Corey,2007-10-05 21:03:00,355,"Ya Gerr... we got room. We got a 2 bedroom with 3 of us at this point. I'm sure we can fit 2 more people, possibly 3.  Let's just all get up there and pack in for the nights. I can't see them kicking us out. We'll just have to see how much more they want to charge.  cd."
121029,irishfield,2007-10-05 21:06:00,26272,Last year I was told I could have six people in our 2 bedroom cottage without addition charge.
