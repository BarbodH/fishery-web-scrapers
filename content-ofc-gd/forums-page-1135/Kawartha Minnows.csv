122440,Jacques,2007-10-11 13:08:00,97,Heading up to Lovesick this weekend for some walleye/muskie fishing.  Still waiting for my first...  I hear there's a bit of a minnow shortage going on up there?  Anyone know who's got some these days?
122502,nelly,2007-10-11 15:38:00,256,"I don't know if they still have minnows. In Peterbrough at lock 19, there are two tackle shop I think, they are both located at each end of  the bridge. Can't think of the name now but someone on the board might remember. Where are you coming from?"
122518,LeXXington,2007-10-11 16:10:00,1928,Minnow shortage is everywhere..

122723,lew,2007-10-12 11:57:00,12767,"There's a tackle store in Lakefield that used to sell minnows, but I think they've changed hands now, and the store is revamped, but it may worth a look.  Their on the north side of the main road as you come into town, just west of the bridge."
