Are the fish from Erie safe to eat these days? Ideally, I would love to eat them if I can get them, but not if it will leave me with a belly full of heavy metals."
120444,joefish,2007-10-03 22:51:00,165,"Definitely safe to eat! Although a bit weedy tasting, if you dont mind... I haven't sprouted any antlers yet so I say go ahead!"
120448,ketchenany,2007-10-03 23:05:00,3229,"Pick up a copy of Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish. A publication I've done for the last 4 years, you will find all of the guidelines to to prpare and enjoy your catch."
120553,xrap,2007-10-04 03:16:00,683,Deadly toxic poison floating in that water...... just kidding. Go ahead enjoy their safe.
120556,BrianV,2007-10-04 03:32:00,35,Sounds like good news on all fronts!
120561,Bob Devine,2007-10-04 06:44:00,251,If you look at most fresh water fish at the stores most are caught on Lake Erie. I would think they are monitored pretty good being a commercially harvested. Enjoy the meal.

120634,misfish,2007-10-04 14:36:00,29133,"Watched a great show awhile back talking how Erie is the shallowests of the great lakes and the water is the fresh,s of all of them.Erie has great fish to eat."
120635,Whopper,2007-10-04 14:50:00,2174,Eat all the gobies you wish
120641,BrianV,2007-10-04 15:03:00,35, Blech!
120655,Zib,2007-10-04 17:12:00,369,To be on the safe side make sure to cut out the bloodline & the belly portion & you should have no worries.
120838,Squid,2007-10-05 13:21:00,1656,Good one whopper!!
121842,BrianV,2007-10-09 15:24:00,35,"Ok, so Selkirk was a complete bust, fishing wise Nowhere to fish on the shoreline - it was mostly a flat rock table extending out into the water, only reaching knee-depth 50' from shore. From the satellite shots it appeared that there was a small bay / inlet in the park, when I walked there, it was mostly mud with a few pools with an inch or two of water.  And to think I have all kinds of new tackle I was getting excited about using! Oh well, it was still a fun trip with my siblings, despite the lack of fishing...."
121922,xrap,2007-10-09 21:24:00,683,"Should of tried Port Maitland Pier for shore fishing. Very deep their and not many snags so you would be able to try all your lures. And the ebst thing of all you can catch any fish at all. I've caught cats, perch, small mouth, pike, sheephead, carp, silver bass, wlleye, and of course gobies."
122037,BrianV,2007-10-10 02:19:00,35, Thanks for the info. I will give that a try next time I am in the Dunnville area!
122429,bigcreekdad,2007-10-11 12:21:00,546,"Of course they are. I grew up on Lake Erie and have been eating fish as many as 5 times a week since I was 6 years old, and still do. The only downside is that it costs twice as much for haircuts for my sons due to the extra head each one was born with."
122545,BrianV,2007-10-11 18:17:00,35, Great. You made me spill my coffee with that last line.  Hope you're proud!
