122769,snag,2007-10-12 13:37:00,1932,I didn't know that Clive (aka Mepps on the board) has been designing swim wear? OUCH!  (Suprised there isn't a hissing/deflating sound)  
122790,tbayboy,2007-10-12 14:44:00,1497, Thanks a lot Rizzo - read that mid breakfast and now I won't be able to eat for days :
122862,kickingfrog,2007-10-12 17:38:00,8333,When did boats start coming with air bags?
122474,Headhunter,2007-10-11 14:45:00,5703,Found this on the web... would you watch this show? http://www.reelappealfishing.com/ HH
122480,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-11 14:50:00,0,Id bite....ah er watch..
122481,Terry,2007-10-11 14:58:00,14456,"no, I have satellite dish for my porn..........LOL  and I don't like mixing my two hobbies together"
122483,Joey,2007-10-11 15:03:00,9122,"Looks pretty stupid to me.  They spent more time flicking their hair than anything else, and then were afraid of the fish  Joey"
122486,Clampet,2007-10-11 15:07:00,1947, Ditto!
122488,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-11 15:07:00,0,"Huh? Apparently 2 of the girls came to Toronto for a promo. Never heard much about it.  Here's your chance to meet two of the lovely Reel Appeal girls in person! As if that isn't enough, if you buy a 2008 Reel Appeal Calendar, both girls with personally autograph it! You don't want to miss out on this one! See below for locations and times...   Saturday September 15, 2007 (1pm - 4pm) JB's Fishing Depot 24 Ronson Drive, Unit 6 - Rexdale, ON  Saturday September 22, 2007 (1pm - 4pm) Fishing World 2411 Barton Street - Hamilton, ON"
122493,DMASSE,2007-10-11 15:15:00,420,What a joke...
122496,jedimaster,2007-10-11 15:25:00,3472,"Thats why I have picture n picture, fishing on the big one and porn on the little one. No need to watch softcore nonsense."
122508,Roy,2007-10-11 15:51:00,13728," Johnny, I think you spelled ""porno' incorrectly. This stuff is about as low as you can get on the exploitation scale. If the two stores in question actually did have them in their shop for a ""promo"". I'm disappointed in them."
122553,huntervasili,2007-10-11 19:09:00,1604,Maybe if I muted the TV... lol
122556,misfish,2007-10-11 19:18:00,29133,Nice boat
122557,Sinker,2007-10-11 19:19:00,8692,"If those girls could actually fish, and throw out some info that I haven't already heard, then yes, Id watch it. But, by the looks of it......No....I wouldn't watch.  Well....maybe just for a bit....lol.  Sinker"
122618,Krisco,2007-10-11 23:24:00,67,"I think it still beats Lunkerville, now that show is brutal."
122628,mistyjr1,2007-10-11 23:55:00,97,Its Shelley and Courtney's cousins.
122629,douG,2007-10-12 00:02:00,2693,"I just LOVE girls like that.  I've never met one, on the other hand."
122631,mason05,2007-10-12 00:12:00,258,I think I'd have a hard time not watching this show.  Nice looking ladies learning how to sport fish.  I smell an emmy already...  Corn Nug
122633,Roy,2007-10-12 00:34:00,13728, You might be on the wrong channel if you're smelling Emmy cause that's Sabrina.
122641,Rizzo,2007-10-12 01:18:00,4754, ...and this is a bad thing? I'm afraid to see how Chronzy will try to compete with this new genre...perhaps wear a pink thong for his next shore lunch
122677,holdfast,2007-10-12 04:20:00,1813,"Fake, Fake, Fake, gotta love the silicone"
122685,saumon,2007-10-12 07:12:00,5,...it seems to me that they were showing a good example: they always had their floatation devices
122692,OhioFisherman,2007-10-12 08:30:00,6623,"LOL, I have met girls like that, issues, they would handle worms but not fish!"
122714,misfish,2007-10-12 11:26:00,29133,  
122732,Wes Bender,2007-10-12 12:17:00,105,My wife tells me there are fishing rods in this photo...HERE I can't see them.
122742,Headhunter,2007-10-12 12:59:00,5703,You guys are pretty funny! Just a few young ladies trying to make a living in a man's world... can't we cut them some slack? LOL HH
122753,Cory,2007-10-12 13:12:00,170,Sort of like watching urban outdoor adventures carp fishing with the twins....
