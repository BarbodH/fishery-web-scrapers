I would typically go to the Toronto Islands but to be honest I'm a little bored of going there and want to try somewhere different.  We want to try somewhere close to Toronto or Newmarket.  The short-list at the moment is Cooks Bay on Lake Simcoe or Lake Scugog.  Which of these two lakes would you recommend for some good action from a variety of fish at this time of year? Also where can we rent a boat from at each place?  It could be my last fishing trip outside of Toronto before I go back to England so want to make it a good one.  Thanks for your help.  007
