123006,ccmtcanada,2007-10-13 14:43:00,7971,"Bly and I have been looking at boats to buy...and had a few questions regarding winterizing.  1)  What do you have to do to the boat?  2)  What prep work needs to be done to the motor?  3)  How much would you approximate that it would all cost?  Example....14 foot aluminum boat, with a 15 to 20 HP motor.  Would store the motor inside during the winter. The boat would likely be stored outside somewhere.  Thanks everyone....getting excited to buy one....have a few we are looking at now."
