Thursday morning started before light and the moment the sun came up float goes down set the hook STEELIE ON!!! quick fight and snap! steelie off!! retie and a couple more drifts and bang STEELIE ON!!! this time a nice little 3 pounder was landed and released to be caught again another day.  couple more drifts and bang steelie on again this one was a pretty little 2 pounder pure silver gorgeous fish. then moved upstream a ways and bang big male chinook and after a quick fight he was sent back on his way.  switched rivers around 10:30 a.m and went downstream. at the first nice hole bang another small steelie.  Now on friday me and 2 buddies went and cleaned right up! at the end of the day we ended up with 3 female chinooks, a nice female brown and 4 or 5 dirty male chinooks as well as numerous fish that got away haha anyways all in all a pretty successful week on the river.    Hawk"
