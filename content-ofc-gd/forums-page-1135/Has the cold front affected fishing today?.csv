We are thinking about heading out tomorrow and not sure if we should just cancel to end the season, the cold front came few days ago, and not sure if it would have shut down bass fishing condition.  Shore Salmon fishing was not good last two days. It was freezing cold at night, with strong wind chill factor.  It will get a little bit warmer again tomorrow."
