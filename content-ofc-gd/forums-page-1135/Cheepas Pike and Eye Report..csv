122608,scuro,2007-10-11 22:50:00,386,"Another fine report from the Bunkster, that sure looks like fun. The leaves are still on the trees? Don't you normally contend with ice and snow by now?"
122735,Moosebunk,2007-10-12 12:43:00,3970,"Rain, rain, rain.... never ending rain Chris.  Snow....... sure hope no time soon but, if it meant less rain I might accept it's coming early.  Leaves are usually on this time of year."

122081,Roy,2007-10-10 08:32:00,13728,"I hope you're keeping a diary, Andrew. When I was a kid, MANY years ago, stories such as yours were what inspired me. I would stay up nights and pour over maps planning the next adventure. Now, fifty plus years later, I read reports such as yours and they still inspire me and send me back to the maps. You're living out a lot of my childhood dreams. Good on ya for sharing your adventures with us."
122085,solopaddler,2007-10-10 08:52:00,8605,"Yep, that was a great read bud, many thanks for taking the time. Interesting about the cranes...I saw a flock of about 100 feeding in a stubblefield just north of Ville Marie on the way home last Sunday. Obviously they do migrate together like geese, but I've never seen it before either."

I get in our canoe for 3 hours and my back is killing and I'm exhausted and there are no portages, very little water that's too shallow for the trolling motor etc....  Amazing report as usual Moose....the story and pics allows me to imagine what you two experienced.  Very pretty scenery...almost as nice as the Shire...you'll have to come fish here sometime.  The fish are a little smaller, but we do ok down here....LOL."

122142,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-10 13:42:00,0,"Another spectacular report! I thought the fishing up there was as easy as finding water, casting and catching but it sounds like you work hard for your fish. Sorry to hear the cheepas wasn't so cheap but over all it sounds like another great adventure in the great Canadian north!"
