According to Niagara Regional Police, one of the boat's occupants placed a distress call after the vessel collided with a water buoy. Police believe the call originated about 3 miles northeast of the Grimsby shore.  Capt. Wayne Sinker with the Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Trenton said that they do not know how many people were on the boat.  ""The harbours along that area were checked by the police to see if there were any vehicles parked there,"" said Sinker. ""But they didn't find anything so we have no idea where it came from.""  Four coast guard vessels, two private vessels that were in the area, a Gryphon helicopter and a Hercules airplane from Trenton have been searching the waters all night and are still continuing.  The marine unit of the Niagara Regional Police Service has added a 30-foot Hike vessel and a 26-foot inflatable boat to the search.  Police are asking anyone with more information about the boat or its possible occupants to call 905-688-4111.  Source: http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/265327"

122363,live2fish,2007-10-11 01:36:00,70,i heard on one of the radio stations there thinking it was a hoax. I dont see how they couldnt find a boat for a day and a half of searching. Its gotta either be a hoax or the boat is at the bottom. Hope everyones allright.  Bowen
122839,Sandbag,2007-10-12 17:08:00,533,"Ya....paper is reporting that they believe it was a hoax as nobody has been reported missing.  I can't understand what someone is thinking if they call in something like that as a hoax.  If they find out who it was, I hope they send them the bill for the rescue efforts, not to mention the lives they endangered with this so called ""prank""  Craig"
