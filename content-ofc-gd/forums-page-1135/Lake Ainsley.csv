122851,Domi Fish,2007-10-12 17:18:00,46,"I can see why no one has heard of this lake, its about the size of a giant turtle pool. You could walk from one end of the lake to the other in about ten minutes, give or take. Theres only three cottages on the entire body of water.. (my buddys being one of them)..Saying this is a small lake is an understatement.  I did quite a bit of fishing there this summer and I must say its a damn good lake for largies. Using live bait, you could literally get fish on every cast. Theres also supposed to be a healthy population of pike, although I didnt catch any..  If youre ever around Whitestone, Ont you should give this lake a try. Its right beside Lake Washweshkesh.(I believe thats how its spelled) About 15 minutes south west on the bunny trail and your there.."
122868,Roy,2007-10-12 17:58:00,13728,I must be getting old. You post last night wanting to know about this lake and today you post that you know quite a bit about this lake. I'm glad it's Friday...my brain hurts.
122887,Domi Fish,2007-10-12 18:48:00,46,Huh?...Take a look at my original post. It says August 17.  That wasn't last night.
122888,Terry,2007-10-12 18:55:00,14456,is this the lake  never heard of it 
122891,Domi Fish,2007-10-12 18:59:00,46,Yep that's it Terry. I screwed up on the spelling.
122895,Roy,2007-10-12 19:22:00,13728,See?? I told you I was losing it.
122899,misfish,2007-10-12 19:44:00,29133, We stayed at a house during  a hunt on that lake or near it anyways. Lots of pike there.
122902,Golfisher,2007-10-12 19:47:00,586,"Roy, get some sleep man!"
122903,misfish,2007-10-12 19:53:00,29133,He will..............
