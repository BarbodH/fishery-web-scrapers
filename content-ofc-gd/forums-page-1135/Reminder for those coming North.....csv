122470,TJQ,2007-10-11 14:30:00,7806,In a couple of days.. ill be leaving for a very long drive through the north...  I thought I would share these pictures to remind everyone (not that we should need it) what the damage a moose - or deer can do if hit...  Lets all have a safe drive...    
122475,Hookset,2007-10-11 14:46:00,367,"Well said T.J.  A few weeks ago, driving home late at night on Hwy 118, I wondered what 2 little lights were doing 6 feet above the highway. My brain finally kicked in and I hammered the brakes. The little lights were eyes. I stopped about 3 feet from a cow Moose. She didn't move an inch. Looked at me as if to say ""what the heck are you doing on my trail ?"" There would still be little Jeep parts scattered on the highway. She was a big girl.  Good Reminder,   Hookset."
122477,Clampet,2007-10-11 14:48:00,1947,"My Grand-nephew Richard, was killed in 2004 when he and his girlfriend hit a moose while heading up to see his father up North.  His dad one one of the Laforge Bros from Sturgeon."
122478,TJQ,2007-10-11 14:49:00,7806,Ive had plenty of close calls....   we used to drive through the nite to get to hunt camp.....  Not anymore.....  always a pack of nerves by arrival... lol
122479,lew,2007-10-11 14:49:00,12767,"Nasty pictures TJ, but a good heads up for anyone travelling.  Seems like there's more & more critters on the road every year, specially just before sunrise. This past August heading up to Lakair there was a deer on the side of hwy 35, so close to the asphalt that I thought I was gonna hit him with my sideview mirror. Last year it was a huge blackbear that wandered out and stopped not 5' from my truck as I was going past  Coming back from Ottawa last July we had another bear run across right in front of us near Perth."
122482,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-11 14:59:00,0,"Nasty stuff...not even any left for dinner....  I had a buddy go out west a few years ago driving his moms delorean. He hit a moose in the head on the way out...if that wasn't enough ,,,on the way back he ran head on into a tractor trailer....no one was hurt .....well....except the moose...who stumbled into the bush after being hit at 120 klm's. The guys mom woke up to blood and glass all over her as she was in the passenger seat on the side the moose was hit....  Crazy ........."
122490,Jen,2007-10-11 15:10:00,833,"Driving home late last night was like travelling through a zoo.  Raccoons, foxes, deer, bunnies and even what I thought were wolves.. three very beautiful ones... although I have never heard of wolves in the Haldiman area they could just have been very big cayotes... and on a night when I didn't have my camera...  Be safe out there guys... specially north where the animals get bigger  Cheers,  Jen"
122492,swiebe,2007-10-11 15:14:00,18,A few years ago driving north to go camping a deer darted out of the trees up ahead and merged with traffic.  Spent a few minutes running between the cars sideswiping them - put a couple good dents in our car - while every car alternated between slowing down to stop or speeding up to get away when she ran behind them.  After a while she ran off the road and got caught in a wire fence - a few cars stopped to try and get her loose but she wouldn't let anyone come near her.  Someone was just calling the local authorities when she finally got herself untangled and ran off into the woods.  Interesting story from the BBC on this subject:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7035815.stm
122501,misfish,2007-10-11 15:37:00,29133,"TJ,Thats not the proper way of transporting your kill.LOL"
122523,fishindevil,2007-10-11 16:49:00,6254,"HOLY CRAP !!!!!!! not to mention you can be killed.  ...and it looks like the person in that car might have been killed as well..  ..i know that train hit them alot and they can even damage a train,...yes something to always remember to keep an eye out for those guys....thanks for sharing that TJ....cheers"
122527,OhioFisherman,2007-10-11 17:09:00,6623,LOL long drive north? you are a long drive north! Were was Rocky? he would have saved his bud!  I am glad big game here is deer!
122534,Rizzo,2007-10-11 17:23:00,4754,"yup, just saw a moose at the side of mill lake (Parry Sound) last saturday"
122540,TJQ,2007-10-11 17:48:00,7806,"I should tell the story of that wreck as I know it... I know there was a board member who was related to the lady in the car...  I think (i may be wrong on a fact or two...) that they had just purchased the car and were headin back down the highway south of North Bay.. she in front and her husband behind her in the other vehicle when she hit the moose.. standing in the road looking right at her... she took the legs outta it and it went like a moose torpedo through the windshield, passing by her and between the seats eventually coming to a rest after going out the rear windshield...  The lady only suffered either a sprained or broken wrist, i cant remember which...  Shes lucky I can only imagine what would have happened had it been a bull with racks..."
122565,HookNrelease,2007-10-11 19:44:00,85,definately not for the faint of heart nor younger viewers but a  grusome remionder of the damage a large animal can do when hit  http://www.pbnation.com/showthread.php?s=&...threadid=777869

122623,carp-starter,2007-10-11 23:35:00,253,"T.J. Quesnel  I have only read and heard about animal accidents but I have never seen any PICS.  I think a PIC worth a lot more than a thousand words. It is just amazing.  Thank you for sharing the PICS.  Hooknrelease  I also thank you for your PICS. After seeing your PICS, I must say that I am not feeling too well. But I will get well as soon as I find my Bromo-Seltzer   Thanx - carp-starter"
