122964,Greencoachdog,2007-10-13 02:22:00,8163,We won't even be expectin' Redneck Snow (Frost) for another month... kinda hard to get snow or frost when daytime temps are still in the 80's!!!
122746,pameladallaire,2007-10-12 13:03:00,470,"I have about an inch of snow so far, anyone else wake up to the white stuff?  Pam"
122748,lew,2007-10-12 13:05:00,12767,"You can just keep it up there too Pam, I'm still in shorts and sandals down here in the banana belt"
122750,Terry,2007-10-12 13:08:00,14456,"shouldn't the internet censors change or remove that 4 letter word.....that is just a rude word, that I just don't need to hear or see right now.....LOL   so no ""winter rain"" here"
122751,Uncle Buck,2007-10-12 13:11:00,1000,My borther called me on the 3rd and said that it snowed up in Calgary... SUCKER ;D
122757,wallyboss,2007-10-12 13:14:00,1095,I can do without snow all winter as long as I have ice!!!!!!!
122760,Bly,2007-10-12 13:16:00,1556,Agree with Terry.....need to filter that word....nasty and foul! lol
122762,Fishmaster,2007-10-12 13:20:00,920,I agree with wallyboss...
122768,Deano,2007-10-12 13:32:00,767,"""shouldn't the internet censors change or remove that 4 letter word.....that is just a rude word, that I just don't need to hear or see right now.....LOL"" Was thinking the same thing when I saw the post, that's a curse word. None here but did have to scrape the windows this morning."
122770,misfish,2007-10-12 13:37:00,29133,"  What the,,,,,,,,,,,, ah never mind.  Hi ya Pam good to hear from you. I thought for a few minutes it just might try here.It was cold enough and the clouds looked dark enough.  Enjoy the white stuff."
122775,Headhunter,2007-10-12 13:47:00,5703,"I stepped out of the house this morning for a smoke and honestly, the first thing I thought of was that it ""smelled"" like Quinte Fishin weather... cool air, the smell of the leaves... big eye time is soon here! HH"
122776,JohnF,2007-10-12 13:47:00,3494, Bleah!!!!!  My dive buddy Rudy is slipping. He usually lets us know when the white stuff hits yer town. He knows we hate the idea that it's coming.  Sheesh. I was actually wondering whether or not I needed to bother with my waders when I go out to the creek on the weekend or if the old shoes would suffice. Now you've made me feel cold. It has to be the waders.  JF
122783,fishnsled,2007-10-12 14:32:00,3520,"Well if were talking about 4 letter words and all, you might as well post a pic as well Pam.  Weather porn.....  HH - Good point!  I was thinking muskies while walking the dog this morning though."
122810,packrat,2007-10-12 15:58:00,93,"Certainly been ""cold"" enough here in the banana belt for a sprinkling of that ""stuff""   Been moaning about record temps we've been having----Thksgiving weekend certainly set some new records for high temps.  Set out for a short stroll this morning and the first thing I do is you guessed it----put on heavier clothes to keep ""warm""     Hoomans is cwazy"

122829,misfish,2007-10-12 16:52:00,29133," Ok,so how did you make out?"
122831,Terry,2007-10-12 16:54:00,14456,"well ,if he was snow hunting he most likely got an inch or 2       snow hunting...inch or 2, I crack me up....LOL"
122836,walleyejigger,2007-10-12 17:03:00,876,"  wellll..... i got there monday, met some guys out there who had just seen a big bull a few minutes before i walked by, no biggie i got no tag, only calf for me, but in the 10+ yrs. of hunting i've never seen a calf so told the guy my goal for the week was just to see a moose, anything,  i had some very good luck in my goal, followed by some immediate very bad luck,  on the way out wednesday night just as it was getting dark i came up on a cow and calf (YES A CALF   ) about 40 yds from me  i managed to get a shot off, but they ran off,   in my search of where they were i found the classic ""broken twig"" but searched a little more anyhow and found a small splatter of blood about 50ft away, WOO HOO   , so headed back to camp for flashlights and to round up a search party, searched for 2 hours in the dark found no calf and no other blood other than the original spot    next morning the 5 of us spent 4 hrs combing the area and came up blank  now i cant get the scenario out of my head"
122848,Rizzo,2007-10-12 17:15:00,4754,"Last year it snowed October 13 in Barrie, then  basically nothing until the middle of January...the rest of that winter I don't want to talk about, I still have snowbanks in front of my house that survived the summer."
122856,pameladallaire,2007-10-12 17:25:00,470,"Well, the snow hunters asked for it.  Pam "
122857,misfish,2007-10-12 17:28:00,29133,"  Now that is funny.  Terry work on yours.  Pam ,are you painting that photo right now?  Sorry to hear of your bad luck Wally."
122861,pameladallaire,2007-10-12 17:34:00,470,"Actually, I have to hurry up and finish my self portrait     and another one of a trail in green bush for our November show here in Timmins.   And a cello painting for next Monday.  Then I get to paint what I want.  "

122871,blaque,2007-10-12 18:02:00,2419,"Snow a four letter word??? I Love the stuff. Not so much the 1-2 inch snowfalls..........but a good foot or more storm that keeps ya off work and on the slopes is a Godsend!!!! Or walking thru some snow covered evergreens to your favorite steelhead hole, white and quiet and alone. LOVE IT!!! Im like a little kid when the snowfalls!! I wouldnt move away from it if ya paid me."
