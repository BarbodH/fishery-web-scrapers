I've been fortunate to have sailed along the beautiful east & north coasts of Newfoundland a few times, close enuff to see it well, and even dodged the many iceburgs, but never had the pleasure of actually visiting the island.....but maybe some day if I'm really lucky !!!!"

He claps once...and says ""for every clap I make, one child dies from hunger"". He claps again, and again, and again Well this is just too much for one of the locals who stands up and shouts... ""well for Jesus H Christ laddy, stop yer focking clapping""  lol I think I got it right."
