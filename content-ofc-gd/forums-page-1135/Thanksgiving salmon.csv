122170,bbnotty,2007-10-10 14:46:00,93,"My son came home from University for thanksgiving with his girlfriend and we headed out to do some salmon fishing. For those that think all salmon hooked in rivers are snagged or flossed, we could see these fish circle around and come back to our floats and then wham float down and fight on. Was alot of fun and in the two days of fishing we had, we landed many fish. Here's a few pics of my son with the salmon.          Berge"

122420,ccmtcanada,2007-10-11 11:39:00,7971,Great report!!!  Looks like a great time was had by all.  Tell your son to hold on to his GF....I love fishing with my wife....and I never have to come up with excuses to fish....cause she wants to be out there as much as I do!!
122514,bbnotty,2007-10-11 16:04:00,93,"thanks for all the good remarks, i was actauly expecting some ripping from some guys. demasse - yes i love fishing for salmon too, they are alot of fun. ccmtcanada- I have told him that he's very lucky that his gf love fishing as much as he does, and yes lots of fun was had by all. My son loves salmon and rainbow fishing but now that he's gone to university he doesn't get to fish as much, so when he comes home we always find time to get out.  Berge"
