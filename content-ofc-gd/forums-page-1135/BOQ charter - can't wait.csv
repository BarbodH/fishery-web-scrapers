It all started 4 weeks ago with my youngest son experiencing his first Gran Mal epileptic seizure resulting in a trip to emergency dept.Very scarey to say the least .Followed up by a trip to his specialist in GTA and an EEG . He is on anti sezure meds and has had no relapses The next weekend we were set to  move on the friday to our new house but thanks to our buyer ( financing)we had a last minute delay with our closing till the following Monday .Everything was packed and loaded on the truck including clothes , fishing gear etc . We unloaded the boat and headed to the inlaws cottage for a place to sleep. We did fish Dalrymple that weekend with no luck The next weekend ( last weekend ) we had our van stolen out of the drive way , luckily found next day with no damage except missing change and cds , didn't even touch Pikeie's new Abu reel.  With the move the days have been busy unpacking , small projects etc .  May get out sunday for a bit but have confirmed our Charter with Fishunter on BOQ for Oct 20 , This was the Tyler auction item we won at Tylers event last winter .  Can't wait for a change pf pace!
