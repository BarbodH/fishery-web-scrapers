I know a lot of places dont carry them, the only place that i do know that has them is selling them for $19 each, ouch!!  Anyone know where i can get a better deal?  i hear they are ""hot"" baits for bows on GBay.  thanks"
122351,solopaddler,2007-10-11 00:51:00,8605,"They've been a hot bait on G. Bay for a loooooong time, at least 20 years if not more. You can get them here for a lot less than $19 http://www.landbigfish.com/tacklestore/showcase.cfm?PID=4372"
122352,trapshooter,2007-10-11 01:00:00,1234,"Jocelyn at Angling Outfitters in woodstock has a good selection, and cheaper too.  You can also get them at the place just outside Collingwood, which I believe is called Great lakes Outfitters.  They are on Hwy 26.  They are expensive but I still buy them because they do produce, no question about it.  Unfortunately, I also find that the finish doesn't last long and I have broken both their splitrings and treble hooks in the past.  Something to consider if you hope to fight a big, angry bow.  With the gin clear water in Gbay try a fluorocarbon leader and use a loop type knot that doesn't cinch down on the eye of the bait.   The rapala knot has always held for me in the past.  Good luck.  I can't wait to get up there myself.  Ben."

122500,JohnF,2007-10-11 15:34:00,3494, The new store in Stratford has 'em too. I stopped in to check this morning. Apparently they're not all that easy to find in some areas. They sure do look like my Rapalas. Is there some difference in the action? I have a few (I think) in the box of stuff I picked up used but I haven't got 'em wet yet.  JF
122728,superdad,2007-10-12 12:04:00,353,Gagnon's in Oshawa used to have them  - haven't been there in a while. Give em a call
