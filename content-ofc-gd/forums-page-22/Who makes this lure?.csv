I bought this lure when I was a kid and I always wanted to get my hands on a few more.  If anyone has this lure in this colour and would like to sell or trade lures, please send me a dm. I think I was about 10 yrs old when my dad took me to port credit and he was able to catch 3 salmon with this lure.  It was the most action we ever had when I was kid.  I was hoping to frame the original lure with a pic of our catches.  I think it would be cool if I could catch a salmon with it as well.
