1069778,FishFinder17,2021-01-19 21:13:00,139,Already tried that. Number is out of service
1069779,Fisherman,2021-01-19 21:48:00,7201,"Maybe a name change, read somewhere else it's still open."
1069781,Cosmos,2021-01-19 22:18:00,588,I saw cars and open doors on Sunday. Looks like it is still in business.
1069792,Rizzo,2021-01-20 01:14:00,4754,yes he is open but the number no longer works. If you go at a prime time I assumeÂ  you will find him there. Non prime time (ie weekdays) he is hit and miss
