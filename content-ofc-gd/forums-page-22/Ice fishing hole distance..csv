1070265,moses,2021-02-03 18:58:00,36,Hi Anglers just wondering what distance you have to be from someone elses fishing hole? Cant seem to find on line in the regs.
1070266,misfish,2021-02-03 19:03:00,29133,"If I can see you, yer too close. LOL The rule of ethics is water depth. So 50 fow, 50ft away. A little dif if you fishing shallow."
1070270,wkrp,2021-02-03 19:34:00,656,Social distance x 10
1070272,Big Cliff,2021-02-03 19:58:00,6899,You won't find it in the regs and there really isn't a set distance. Let common courtesy be your guide. In the past if I was going to setup anywhere close to another fisher person I would simply ask if they minded or whould they prefer I moved further off. I can't remember ever being asked to move off and I have ended up fishing with some really nice people.
1070275,Fisherman,2021-02-03 20:14:00,7201,"Depends on how many donuts you bring, inversely proportional equation."
1070276,misfish,2021-02-03 20:53:00,29133,"If your running a Vexlar finder Cliff, beat it a mile away.LOL"
1070277,AKRISONER,2021-02-03 20:55:00,5558,"yup, try to be courteous on the water...and honestly always ask if the people mind if you fish there."
1070286,Rizzo,2021-02-04 00:51:00,4754,years ago I was fishing L St. John near Orillia. I was catching pike after pike from the same hole. Well don't you know...the clown who set up around 60 feet away comes and drills a hole like 10 feet from the one that was producing! Best part was he didn't get any...served him right
1070298,LeXXington,2021-02-04 14:55:00,1928,If i can toss a snowball and hit you too close
1070300,GBW,2021-02-04 16:01:00,8460,If I can read what's written on the hut or jacket also too close.
1070305,moses,2021-02-04 20:30:00,36,"I quess if i can read your text from your phone, im too close lol"
1070307,misfish,2021-02-04 21:12:00,29133,A sense of humor. AWESOME
