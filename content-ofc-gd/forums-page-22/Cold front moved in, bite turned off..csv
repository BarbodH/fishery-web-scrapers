We worked hard and tried a variety of baits and techniques but best we could do for the day was 6 keeper perch. It was still wonderful to get out there and I am really loving having someone else worry about maintaining the hut and all and me just being able to relax and fish 😊. Thursday we caught a burbot and decided to try it, OMG was it ever good! We went on Youtube to research cleaning and cooking them and got some great ideas. We decided to try a couple of variations for cooking it and our favourite was cut into chunks like scallops,  tossed in fishcrisp, and pan fried in oil. Never again will burbot be released 😁"

A burbot meal is still on my bucket list. I caught one back in the late 70's when we used to rent huts for overnighters with Floyd Hales out of Beaverton. Didn't have a clue back then what it was and released it. Over 40 years of chasing perch on Simcoe and I never caught another one. It will be going in my belly if I do get another one."

1070423,Terry,2021-02-07 17:08:00,14456,Yup me too few fish around but wouldn’t bite
1070430,DRIFTER_016,2021-02-07 21:17:00,10439,I decided to pass on today as I figured the cold front here would shut things down too. Things like molecular movement!!!! 🥶 🥶 🥶 
1070440,DRIFTER_016,2021-02-08 15:17:00,10439,The ice fishing was mint bye!!!
