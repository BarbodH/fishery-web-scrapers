Circle is a good way to go.  Much cheaper but still pricey, the boating is big water play but structure safe if that provides you peace of mind and, your boat will release 150-300 lakers for the week, depending on dates and how you want to use your time.  20-30 pounders very likely, almost a given.  30-40 pounders a decent chance. 40+ possible and, there have been a few 50+.  That piece of the lake is very well the most beautiful too.  High hills and cliffs, channels, deep back bays, it's more like parts of Great Slave.  Anglers going to Circle unguided tend to catch double to quadruple what the main lodge catches without taking pricey flyouts to hotspots. You want a better chance at a 50, 60 and maybe even 70 pound laker... Plummer's Trophy Lodge.  Guided, expensive, not as scenic, fewer fish caught, LOT more giants. "
