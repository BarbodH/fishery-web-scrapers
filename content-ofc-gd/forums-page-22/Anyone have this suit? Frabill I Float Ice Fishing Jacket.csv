1069382,GBW,2021-01-12 00:04:00,8460,Just wondering if anyone has one and pros and cons to it.  CTC has them on clearance at my store so I placed an order online.  Reg. $599 for $349.  Looks like a jacket and bib at that price.
1069384,Fisherman,2021-01-12 00:47:00,7201,"Must be a store special, shows at $509 on sale."
1069385,GBW,2021-01-12 01:02:00,8460,Odd.  This is what I see. 
1069390,Fisherman,2021-01-12 02:19:00,7201,"Yellow tag above Frabil 1 ice fishing jacket, in store clearance."
1069391,GBW,2021-01-12 02:33:00,8460,"Yup, but the store that you are seeing is just a sale price.  That's what I find as odd."
1069436,GBW,2021-01-12 23:55:00,8460,Spoiled myself and got one.  I am 6' @ 170LBS and the LG jacket fits well with a shirt and semi thick hoodie and I tried the bib pants on with thick lined pants and had room.  Now to make adjustments before I actually get out.
1070401,GBW,2021-02-06 22:44:00,8460,"Update.  So I went with the XL as my under layer I wear THICK warm pants.  Picked up the XL today.  Going to sell the other set if CTC doesn't return them after the lockdown is over.  They were never used on the ice, sled or anything.  Just had them on in the house to see if they relaxed a bit.  The LG jacket was a great fit on me but the XL means I can have extra layers now."
