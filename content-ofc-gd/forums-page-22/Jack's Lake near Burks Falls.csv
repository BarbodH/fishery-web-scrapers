1069493,Rizzo,2021-01-14 00:05:00,4754,"Extended family have decided to rent a number of cottages this summer on Jack's Lake near Burks Falls. As the lone fisherman in the group they paid no heed to my opinion. To my chagrin, there are no muskies here, or anywhere near here. Can anyone tell me about the lake though? Is it busy? Quiet? Nasty for swimming due to weeds? Any fishing info also appreciated and can be pm'ed if preferred. Thanks"
1069500,irishfield,2021-01-14 00:50:00,26272,I wouldn't worry too much about the fishing Roger.. as you probably won't be there!
1069544,Rizzo,2021-01-15 01:48:00,4754,don't be that way...It'll happen. No way are they going to lock it down that long...they better not!

1069550,antonio77,2021-01-15 14:10:00,32,"I do agree with everyone but still there are a lot of social network pictures showing people do not respect anything. I do not think that fishing, hunting or any other outdoor activity is the issue now. Nobody can stop people of being free nowadays."

1069745,Rizzo,2021-01-19 00:35:00,4754,"ya not too worried about the fishing...we will figure that out. It was more the characteristics of the lake (ie lots of weeds so no swimming, overrun with jet skiers etc) that I was hoping to figure out. Sounds like there is minimal knowledge of this place!"
1069747,Rizzo,2021-01-19 00:40:00,4754,thanks Norpiker there was some interesting info on that fact sheet. Sounds like it is quite a shallow lake with poor clarity. There is some interesting details about the fishery too. I guess time will tell if we have nice clean swimming or swimming with weeds grabbing at your legs (if we can even go!)
