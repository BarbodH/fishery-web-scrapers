1069555,squirrel761,2021-01-15 15:13:00,30,Iâ€™ve been working on my ice fishing sled and have it just about ready to go. Now we need this lockdown to end so I can head north to use it  
1069556,AKRISONER,2021-01-15 15:31:00,5558,is this getting attached to a tongue and snowmobile? or are you hauling it by hand?  If by hand are you planning on adding anything to get it up above deep snow? I like the overall design though. Nice and organized and alls for you to absolutely know if youve left anything on the ice at the end of the day.
1069557,Cosmos,2021-01-15 15:34:00,588,Very nice. I would recommend to add a pair of downhill ski. Huge difference when you pull it.
1069559,AKRISONER,2021-01-15 17:04:00,5558,hes gonna be a in a world of hurt if hes planning on tugging that thing by hand through any snow lol. I know because ive done it too many times when my sled isnt running or the ice isnt good enough lol
1069560,squirrel761,2021-01-15 17:19:00,30,A tow bar goes on the front and itÂ will be towed behind a snowmobile most of the time. I have a pair of skis waiting for a Scotty sled when I get around to building it. Used the bare sled last yearÂ on a trip up north of Thunder Bay to Pasha Lake CabinsÂ and things were bouncing around and getting damaged because of the auger. This way I should be able to take everything and keep things organized. If this lockdown gets extended it looks like Iâ€™ll be putting it back into storage before I get to use it ðŸ˜¥

1069658,cisco,2021-01-17 00:44:00,597,Nice work. Might want to put a bag around the power head to keep track snow and slush from getting into the carb.
1069659,squirrel761,2021-01-17 01:28:00,30,The sled has a full cover on it but I will take your suggestion and make a separate bag for the auger power head. Thanks for the input.
