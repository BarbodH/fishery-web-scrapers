1069485,grimsbylander,2021-01-13 22:29:00,3016,The “About Us” page looks legitimate and a quick search on Steve Galea gives you many ties to Ontario out of Doors.  	I doubt blatant identity theft would be a good way to launch a crooked website.  	I’d buy from them.
1069486,misfish,2021-01-13 22:58:00,29133,Yes I noticed the name . I sent an email to make sure he is still in business. Most of the reviews and comments are 2018 . Nice that he is local as well .
1069504,misfish,2021-01-14 11:17:00,29133,"Order put in this morning . Will see how it goes . Seems anywhere you want to buy on line,shipping is $13-$16 Can post . Worth it if you can not get anywhere local here .  Hope to get soon as I have a few orders to fill . Seems some people are liking my ties . Fun hobby to make a little extra cash . Wont get rich, but keeps me out of trouble ."
1069506,woodenboater,2021-01-14 13:35:00,2277,I use email Interac payment if dealing with sellers in Canada. Paypal has been fine. Bet he'd do curbside if one wanted to make a trip to Haliburton and pay in cash
1069842,misfish,2021-01-21 23:10:00,29133,"Little worried now. Sent an email to see about my shipment. No reply Click on the site and well, it is not good . https://algonquinflytying.com/ If I do not get my shipment in a week or so ,how do I go about getting my money back ? I used my credit card .  This is what I was worried about. "
1069845,woodenboater,2021-01-22 00:02:00,2277,screen cap the website and your receipt etc.. open a dispute (I think it's called). undelivered goods. good luck
1069849,Terry,2021-01-22 02:58:00,14456,I would contact you credit card company I see there Facebook page was last updated in 2019
1069873,misfish,2021-01-22 20:44:00,29133,"Well, all is ok. I got to talk to Steve this morning. Man what a gentleman. He sent out his last 4 orders yesterday morning. He is really having a hard time getting supply,s. I totally agreed with him as I have seen other sites with SOLD OUT, on many items . He is not comfortable buying for higher prices and having to do pass that on to his customers. We got to chat about fly fishing in the Algonquin park. I got to get up there his summer to try a few spots he  noted to me . Hope he gets back to selling .  All the best Steve."
1069877,Terry,2021-01-22 21:36:00,14456,Glad it worked out
1069889,singingdog,2021-01-23 10:09:00,1047,"I can vouch for Steve. Totally legit guy. He is isn't the best online communicator, but he knows his stuff and delivers. He's obviously not going anywhere: has been writing for Outdoor Out of Doors for ages. If you want good intel on nymphing for Algonquin specks, you can't go wrong with him."
1069890,misfish,2021-01-23 11:03:00,29133,Exactly what we were talking about singingdog . Need to get deep in those pools.
