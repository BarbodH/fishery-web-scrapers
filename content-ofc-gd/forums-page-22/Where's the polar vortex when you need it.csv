1069740,Fisherman,2021-01-18 22:45:00,7201,"You know what the difference is between weather forecasters and politicians.  Both full of lies, just one gets better pay for lying better.   Weather forecasters should only get paid when they ""get it right"""
1069574,LefroyFisherman,2021-01-15 22:08:00,602,"Walked down to the end of my street up near the 7th line of Innisfil, no ice for as far as to be seen. Thought by now they were calling for this polar vortex of like -15 temperatures. The long term forecast isn't all the promising either. Gonna be another short season  Too bad, with me being off a bit because of Covid would have been nice to be able to fish too pass the time."
1069576,Fisherman,2021-01-15 22:37:00,7201,"Mother Nature at work, too hot, too cold, too windy, did I miss any, lol."
1069579,misfish,2021-01-15 23:02:00,29133,Yup  Perfect smoking temps . Ribs are on the menu for Saturday .
1069580,Big Cliff,2021-01-15 23:11:00,6899,"No un necessary travel, the polar vortex is in lock down 😊"
1069581,misfish,2021-01-15 23:18:00,29133, Time to get a brisket in the smoker Cliff. 👍
1069582,misfish,2021-01-15 23:51:00,29133,2 words for ya  DA RIVER
1069584,LefroyFisherman,2021-01-15 23:55:00,602,"Agreed, but the father in law put his little tinny down for the season lol"
1069586,RickOnt,2021-01-16 00:06:00,669,I think Big Cliff has it. We will be out there. but it will be a short season on the ice. But we might be able to get the boats out early.
1069592,PUMP KNOWS,2021-01-16 01:40:00,937,It’s currently pouring rain where I’m at...haha
1069595,GBW,2021-01-16 01:52:00,8460,"Plus 2 here with mixed rain and a tad of snow in Lindsay as I post this. With my back being as bad as it is and this weather, I won't be fishing this weekend and I will be tinkering with the new toys I got for my Ryker."
1069604,DRIFTER_016,2021-01-16 06:35:00,10439,It's coming. You just need a little patients. https://www.severe-weather.eu/global-weather/winter-weather-pattern-forecast-january-2021-usa-europe-fa/?fbclid=IwAR1aWohcm39C4pw7R46lV0JXR_pwEJ8o917PA8HcCnI7hzWORT8vPCJC1Ak
1069618,grimsbylander,2021-01-16 16:41:00,3016,Ok doc. 😁
1069619,grimsbylander,2021-01-16 16:44:00,3016,In the last week I’ve seen two motorcycles and my neighbour raking his gardens. Bring on spring!
1069621,LefroyFisherman,2021-01-16 17:01:00,602,Is that the proper term to describe your patients?
1069624,grimsbylander,2021-01-16 17:10:00,3016,"If you’re describing sick kids, yeah. 😉"
1069627,dave524,2021-01-16 17:43:00,4508,"Just hit 43 here on the thermometer on the north side of the detached garage, so far the snowblower inside is unused this winter 👍"
1069630,Mr Greedydrift,2021-01-16 18:01:00,25,If the launches are not locked down
1069636,misfish,2021-01-16 19:02:00,29133,And many wonder why there was a huge surge of yak and canoe and electric motor sales this year. No launch required.
1069644,DRIFTER_016,2021-01-16 20:27:00,10439,LEAF ME ALONE!!!! MY BRANE's BEEN BROKED BYE COVID!!!!  😜 😜 😜
1069665,GregF2,2021-01-17 13:10:00,46,"Every week, forecasters say cold is coming and every week it gets delayed.  Same as last winter.  I can’t believe how poorly a job forecasters do.  If it does come, it will probably be Spring and by then ready for warmth.  Annoying weather!"
1069666,AKRISONER,2021-01-17 14:02:00,5558,Winters back baby!
1069672,dave524,2021-01-17 17:03:00,4508,Sunny and low forties here 👍
1069690,BillM,2021-01-17 22:14:00,17367,-1 in Phelpston.  Brrrrrrrrrrrr   lol
1069704,LefroyFisherman,2021-01-18 01:44:00,602,"Well, Looks like it's finally getting cold this coming week, so maybe 2-3 weeks out for fishing near me. Hopefully"
1069737,MJIG,2021-01-18 22:14:00,227,It seemed so promising with the cold snap way back in November.
