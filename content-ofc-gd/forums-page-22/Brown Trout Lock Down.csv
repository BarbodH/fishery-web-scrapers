1069522,DanD,2021-01-14 17:48:00,2223,Very nice fish and very respectable of you and your partner's respect and handling of the fish. I usually don't watch many video's but I'm glad I did this one. New fishers could learn a lot by watching. There is one thing I have to ask; is it uncomfortable walk with a horseshoe stuck up; never mind. LOL Thanks for posting. Dan.
