1070157,misfish,2021-01-31 17:27:00,29133,"Well we got some ice on whitie grounds and all my lines have at least one of my creations as a drop . Been playing around with some different things. Mostly blood and grub style. We set up in 23 fow with a solid 5-8 inches of ice. I had two hits this morning ( only two fish that came in ) and both were on my ties. The first one bucked off at the hole . Caught the ice on the tip of the hook. Second one found his way out of the hole by my bear grip.¬† These fish came off the bottom and smashed the fly's. No checking it out,just up and smash . I was so jacked. Of course,me fishing partner for the morning was like,hey,I need some of those baits. LOL. As always, I shared . Christen the new hub as well.LOL Finally a feed of fresh whitefish and fries tonight. Me fav.    "

1070170,akaShag,2021-01-31 21:16:00,2073,"Brian, when you say ""as a drop""¬† Are you using a heavy lure on bottom (meegs, etc) and the fly higher up as a dropper?¬† If yes, what knot, and are you tying it on like a drop shot, or on a bit of leader, or ???? I always thought I should try jigging for whities with a Michigan wiggler, in fact might have tried it once back in the mid 80s, but.......? Doug"
1070171,misfish,2021-01-31 21:30:00,29133,"Yes, they are all above a lure. Meegs,vibrato , williams . https://www.netknots.com/fishing_knots/drop-shot-rig "
