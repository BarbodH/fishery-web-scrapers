1069840,GBW,2021-01-21 21:55:00,8460,Score!  Good luck with the new toy and enjoy.
1069841,porkpie,2021-01-21 23:09:00,2521,"You’ll like the quick flip one.  Everything I’ve owned by Eskimo has been top notch, and the one thing I had that was a lemon they replaced quickly!"
1069857,Sinker,2021-01-22 14:42:00,8692,"Get yourself a 2x6 the length of your truck bed to slide that hut into your truck bed on. Much easier than lifting it.  I used a Clam Fish trap for years. It eventually wore the sled part out, and I sold it, but it was decent. S."
1069879,akaShag,2021-01-22 22:07:00,2073,Good idea!  Thanks!
1069885,FILTHY OAR,2021-01-23 01:28:00,65,I have the Eskimo wide one inferno ( thermo ) not the lightest but pretty light and it's the most comfortable one man I have ever fish in
1069992,Shloim,2021-01-26 16:22:00,515,Got the frabill thats 620 at Cabelas. Very light and I bolted skiis right to it! Happy so far!!!!  
1070013,misfish,2021-01-26 21:43:00,29133,"Thinking of going back to a 2 man hub. Weight 20lbs . I fish alone, so a hub is just well and fine. I can set it up in minutes. Wind or no wind. I already have a 6ft bogan ( that slides slick as butter on toast ),2 milk crates,and auger that just sit nice in it. The hub will strap on easy. https://www.cabelas.ca/product/140855/cabelas-2-person-ice-shelter"
1070014,akaShag,2021-01-26 21:51:00,2073,"""wind or no wind"" eh!!!  When the ice is as bare as a baby's bottom, no snow to put on the skirts, and the wind is gusting to 30+++, PLEASE take a video of you setting it up and taking it down.  Thinking I might learn some new curses.........😁 With snow on the ice and low wind, these pop-ups are the cat's meow, lots of room, super light, windproof, nice and dark for looking down the holes....but on bare ice and with a wind, they are too much for this arthritic old fart to handle.  I never tired para-sailing and don't want to start now! Doug"
1070016,Terry,2021-01-26 21:59:00,14456,Just like the flip over huts we use the ice shavings from drilling holes  to hold down the skirts.  	and I screw down one corner before i start setting it up
1070017,akaShag,2021-01-26 22:03:00,2073,"Good points, and yes I have done both, but I have found in a big blow that one man can't do it by himself.  Particularly if that one man is older, with a bad back, and named DOUG.  😉"
1070021,misfish,2021-01-26 22:36:00,29133,"Will pick my days Doug for it. I have set up in winds. First put in anchor,then attach bungee cord to anchor then to hub. Proceed with set up. This would not be my first or second hub.  1st was a 2 man,2nd, a 4 man . Ya it can be a bit of a P3TA, but like I said, pick my days. I even anchor my flip the same way."
1070027,akaShag,2021-01-27 00:32:00,2073,"Hmmm, I had not thought about that.  I did have a small flip-up shelter a long time ago, maybe 25 years or so, and come to think of it, that did get away from me one time on the Bay of Quinte.  I was done for the day and put my stuff on the ice, and WHOOPS away went the shelter, like a freakin ice sailboat.  After I chased it almost to shore, I was unhappy enough that I sold it......... So thanks Brian, for that bit of advice! Doug"
1070045,Fisherman,2021-01-27 18:23:00,7201,"Well you can always park a couple of ARGO tires on the windward side, if it still moves you're probably pushing hurricane winds."
1070046,akaShag,2021-01-27 18:27:00,2073,"Got the tracks on her now, buddy!  But no ice anywhere that can take that weight yet..........."
1070047,Fisherman,2021-01-27 18:37:00,7201,"No, I'm not venturing out yet either."
1070058,misfish,2021-01-27 22:01:00,29133,I will test on Saturday.     
1070059,Terry,2021-01-27 22:02:00,14456,Yippee
1070060,misfish,2021-01-27 22:04:00,29133,You will be there too . Your not getting off that easy.LOL
1070062,Fisherman,2021-01-27 22:34:00,7201,"If this dam snow ever stops, should be good by then."
1070066,misfish,2021-01-27 22:40:00,29133,"Yup. Lets hope the wind stays up a bit to push the snow off, or away from my spot anyways.LOL"
1070071,Carp,2021-01-28 00:35:00,1488,"I have an old pair of skis, maybe two, stored in the garage someplace. Always thought of making some sort of ice fishing sled. Good idea here !"
1069339,akaShag,2021-01-10 22:01:00,2073,"Well, I have owned probably twenty ice fishing shelters of one kind or another, from a heavy wooden 10 by 12 foot monstrosity that I put on Lake Simcoe the year the ice all melted on 2 January and when it froze again in February my shack floor was two feet under the ice surface.............to a flimsy ripstop nylon half-dome that weighed about two pounds.   I've made the Ontario out of Doors huts, at least four of them (with and without part-walls), had a big four-man Clam, smaller Rapala shelter with the shock-corded poles, etc etc. I am ready to go to a one-person flip-over type shelter.  I have a bad back and can't wrestle anything heavy out of, or more importantly back into my truck.  What is the LIGHTEST, decent quality one man shelter out there?  I do not want to wrestle with poles and carrying bags, been there done that.  And for the most part, I will be pulling the thing by hand.  Inside space is a smaller consideration than weight. Hands-on advice would be greatly appreciated. Doug"
1069340,misfish,2021-01-10 22:23:00,29133,"Have made my fair share of those too Doug . They were the MUST build back then. Got you out of the elements . Wind mostly . Learned about them when I fished the Credit river . Many of the ole byes back in the late 70,s early 80,s, used them. Hell, they left them leaned up against a tree when they came off the ice. No one ever touched them. Always there when they returned.  My Rapala 1 man is light. I do use a smitty to pull/push, it out. Makes life much easier. I have found that PUSHING the smitty is much easier as well, rather then pulling."
1069341,akaShag,2021-01-10 22:25:00,2073,Thanks Brian.  Do you have a photo of it?
1069342,misfish,2021-01-10 22:31:00,29133,"Sorry no. But I can take one this week. It,s in the back of my truck screaming for ice action."
1069343,akaShag,2021-01-10 22:34:00,2073,Is it a flip-over?  Looks like the Rapala CRUZ is a flip-over......  I had the lightweight Rapala one/two man pop-up but it is a PITA to take down in any amount of wind.  But yes it is VERY lightweight!
1069344,misfish,2021-01-10 22:39:00,29133,"Yes, it,s a one man flip. I removed the bench seat and use a folding chair. Much lighter now."
1069346,akaShag,2021-01-10 23:13:00,2073,Thanks Brian.  How about other folks?  Any recommendations?  I used to see a fair number of one-person CLAM shelters out on Quinte...
1069347,Hack_Fisherman,2021-01-10 23:52:00,720,"Can I ask what a smitty is? I just bought a rapala 4 man Edit; spell check screwed me. I meant Smitty, I know what smutty is"
1069348,Dutch01,2021-01-11 00:17:00,1431,"I sold my Rapala Cruz M1 'cause it was too heavy, but a lot of that weight is in the bench you removed.   @akaShag The CLAM Kenai is pretty light at 45 pounds, but its tight in there.  I sat in one at Trombly's for a long time and almost bought it (sometimes I still wish I did!)"
1069350,akaShag,2021-01-11 01:13:00,2073,
1069353,misfish,2021-01-11 10:06:00,29133,YUP That thing weighed 30lbs LOL I can pick that hut up and throw it in the truck no problems. I could not pass on the $100 I paid for it.
1069354,akaShag,2021-01-11 12:24:00,2073,I'll give you $200.................😉
1069357,Fang,2021-01-11 14:31:00,1330,I have a Clam nanook as well as a single Frabill recon. Over the years have been able to fish in and around a multitude of other makes with buddies and the lightest and easiest I've ever come across was the Clam 5600. My buddy popped his on top a smitty and it pulled like a dream in all kinds of conditions even with a hand auger and gear strapped on. He used to fasten the clam on the smitty with bungee cords and then a couple gear bags and auger on top. I've been looking for one used for a few years but never really found one in good condition or close by. They get bought up fast. It's still around 70lbs in weight but it was way easy to handle than my nanook for 2 people and worth the extra room over a single to fish 2 lines
1069358,AKRISONER,2021-01-11 14:58:00,5558,"I agree that most of this is going to be sled design. A nice little smitty that you can strap a bagged 1 man pop up and your auger to would be the way to go. Anything with built in seats etc is going to be heavy. Fold out fabric chair, auger, unit, rods and a small tent pop up on a smitty should be easy enough to drag."
1069360,porkpie,2021-01-11 15:20:00,2521,"I have a frabil recon.  It’s pretty light if you pull the seat out and just take a small folding stool or chair.  All depends how comfortable you want to be.  My back is shot from an old injury.  I can hoist it into the truck no problem, but I have to take a decent chair.  Bad back and bucket don’t go well together so any way you look at it I’m pulling the weight of something comfortable to sit in."
1069367,akaShag,2021-01-11 19:13:00,2073,"Thanks folks.  Most of you understand my aversion to weight, but I also HATE wrestling with pop-ups (some of which are VERY light).  This is especially the case in windy conditions.  I was thinking that a flip-up would be MOSTLY impervious to wind gusts when it is being put up or taken down. I have done some ""research"" aka Google searches, and it seems that most Ontario stores are sold out of one-man flip-up shelters of any make.  That Frabil Recon looked like the way to go, but if a guy can't find one to buy it's kind of academic.  😐  The way this winter is going there might not be much of an ice season anyways - a buddy and I were out on one of the back lakes this morning and fished on about 3 inches of ice, after we detoured around some stuff that was 2"" and wet on top........ So I might be looking to buy something this fall for next winter.  Be prepared! Doug"
1069368,misfish,2021-01-11 20:37:00,29133, Supply and demand  $400 LOL
1069374,akaShag,2021-01-11 21:49:00,2073,$400 delivered to Kingston?  😁
1069375,Burtess,2021-01-11 22:19:00,901,"I've had the Eskimo QuickFlip 1 for a few years, the reason I bought it was, at the time, the lightest flip on the market.  It's held up well has a fold up seat instead of a built in one, but I take that with me when I fish in the pop out too.  Its pretty comfortable.  "
1069376,misfish,2021-01-11 22:32:00,29133,"DANG, Good to hear from you Burtess . See you are still working on that burger.LOL"
1069377,akaShag,2021-01-11 22:52:00,2073,Thanks for the input!  Any idea where a fella could buy one?
1069378,Burtess,2021-01-11 22:53:00,901,Lol Brian... its a big burger.  Ya I still exist 😁
1069380,Burtess,2021-01-11 22:55:00,901,Like you said above probably everybody is out of everything.  I bought mine at LeBaron…. I do miss that place!
1069398,porkpie,2021-01-12 04:51:00,2521,That’s a good one.  I had the original green quick flip 1.  It was very lightweight!
1069838,akaShag,2021-01-21 20:42:00,2073,"Sometimes it helps to have buddies in the outdoors industry............turns out a buddy of mine (Vortex optics) knows the sales rep for Eskimo, who knew of a Quick Flip 1 that was in a warehouse somewhere...............and it's on its way. Thanks for the advice, folks!  Now let's get some of that hard water, eh! Doug"
