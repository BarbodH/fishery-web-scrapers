1069961,misfish,2021-01-25 20:51:00,29133,Thanks  
1069964,PUMP KNOWS,2021-01-25 21:48:00,937,So sick....gonna pick some up. I just bought myself a vice but don‚Äôt have any materials and tools for it yet. 
1069966,misfish,2021-01-25 21:57:00,29133,"Getting ready to spend.LOL One thing I found was do not get caught up on the high end stuff. I buy 3-4 bobbins for like 5-7 bucks. The one I really like the best,I can not find anymore. There are many DIY tips on you tube. One thing for sure, have one set of scissors dedicated to snipping close to your ties. Thread and trimming only . Use cheap dollar store ones for cutting feathers and wires and what not.  In the last year, I think I have come along way from when I started . I even came across a box of stuff I made a couple of years ago . I looked at them and said ,these things are brutal. LOL  I did not mention that those stones are run under a float by these guys. Just like a roe bag .  Have fun tying PK. B  "
1070108,msp,2021-01-29 16:19:00,1336,Nice work. About 22 years ago I started tying this fly because there was an old guy on the river that hammer steelhead with a massive stone fly. Like almost 2 inches long. He let me in on his secret and I came up with this version. Back then it was hard to get the good jig style hooks. Nothing pretty but the steelhead loved it especially late winter early spring. Was my secret for a couple years till everyone caught and stated refining it to the nice ones you see in the stores now. I always experimented with different colour combos. I remember an all white one with yellow was the ticket one year 
1070251,misfish,2021-02-02 23:43:00,29133,"Thanks I am only 18 years behind the times.LOL Now that my son knows I can tie,his buddies are always asking for something. LOL  I will have to try this white yellow combo one. Thanks msp."
