1069532,Raycaster,2021-01-14 20:24:00,528,The “connections” feature basically allows you the ability to invite other users to post their boats gps on your map. Once they “accept” I think their boat position would be updated on your maps for 24hrs. So you could easily find your buddy on a lake if fishing in different boats etc. It would be a great safety feature if someone got lost etc. I can definitely see using this with friends if this works like I think it does...  https://www.navionics.com/usa/features/connections
