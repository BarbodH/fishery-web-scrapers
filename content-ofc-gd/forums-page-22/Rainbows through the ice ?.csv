I'm curious to hear what anyone uses and some of the depths they fish. Ice conditions for the lake were 5""-6"" everywhere we drilled , and we drilled alot LOL. Any Intel\ opinion  is much appreciated . R    "
1069743,grimsbylander,2021-01-18 23:52:00,3016,Years ago I used to fish rainbows through the ice on GBay. Simple setup...roe bags and tiny split shot in 6' of water. Lying on the ice with a dark blanket over my head and watching the roe bag in gin clear water. Your heart about stops when a big bow cruises in for a snack. SO much fun!!
