1069244,Terry,2021-01-08 09:13:00,14456,"Yup , you do you need more equipment"
1069245,misfish,2021-01-08 09:46:00,29133,You would know.LOL 
1069246,Garnet,2021-01-08 11:06:00,2056,You canÂ  return to feeling normal. There's video of Tom Monsoor tackle collection. He is a FLW tour pro.
1069253,mamona,2021-01-08 15:43:00,597,I do not see anything wrong in this picture
1069467,akaShag,2021-01-13 18:43:00,2073,Some of the rods are too long for the rod bag?
1069491,Rizzo,2021-01-13 23:59:00,4754,"not that it is ""re-tying"" but when I am musky fishing I will for sure have 3 rods nearby ready to go....sometimes that number is 4 or 5!"
1069594,PUMP KNOWS,2021-01-16 01:51:00,937,That looks like tanglesÂ waiting to happen. I started using golf club protectors over my ice rods to prevent lines from getting tangled with my other rods. Â I donâ€™t have to worry about my hooks coming off the hook keeper and messing up my fishing.
1069596,akaShag,2021-01-16 01:55:00,2073,What the heck are golf club protectors?Â  A google search showed me booties that go over golf club heads............ Doug
1069598,PUMP KNOWS,2021-01-16 02:00:00,937,Sorry GolfÂ tube protectors. Â I think theyâ€™re made for a golf bag? Â They fit my ice rods perfect but some ice rods wonâ€™t fit. Â Just make sure the biggest guides on your ice rod isÂ smaller then the diameter of the tube. Â I think I paid $2 a tube from Canadiantire a few years ago  
1069599,akaShag,2021-01-16 02:02:00,2073,"Interesting, thanks. Doug"
1069601,Old Man,2021-01-16 02:43:00,822,Youâ€™reÂ Â an amateur until you hit 2 dozen ice rods. ðŸ˜‰
1069631,PUMP KNOWS,2021-01-16 18:11:00,937, Here's a clip of the tube in use.Â  Check at 1:04 mark  
1069635,akaShag,2021-01-16 18:36:00,2073,"Seen.Â  Looks like you are quite the ""gear guy!""Â  I watched the clip for about 8 minutes - until you landed and released the grey.Â  NICE! Doug"
