1070247,fishdawg,2021-02-02 20:35:00,912,"Very close to pulling the trigger on a mid August trip with the family (wife, son 13, daughter 6.5)  to Bounce lake with Cochrane air service Not looking for fishing tips just yet, but any suggestions /advice before we put a deposit down? Spoke with one of their guys for 15 minutes and feel good about it"
1070248,410001661,2021-02-02 22:43:00,127,I heard good things about them but check out this guy - https://www.canadafishingguide.net/ He seems to have the in on where to go and what to expect.  I used him on my last two trips and they were excellent
1070250,Terry,2021-02-02 23:21:00,14456,"One of their planes crashed a while ago They were alright,  lots of walleye to catch at the lake I went to But they did advertise 10 pound plus walleye.  When we were waiting for our plane we saw a book of trophies for each lake, it was a photo album we were very disappointed to not see a single photo of a fish over 6 lbs when they said 10 lbs plus.     But other then that it was a good trip"
1070257,Moosebunk,2021-02-03 04:09:00,3970,"For about an extra $100PP.... if these guys are open and you're willing to drive a little farther, this is a fly-in pike and walleye tour I'd do.  Lake has a lot of bigger than average eyes. http://www.onamanlake.com/Onaman_Lake4.html"
1070284,fishdawg,2021-02-03 23:21:00,912,"Thanks bunk..  we ended up booking on Bounce.. nice cabin, seems like a good fit for family and feel we got a good deal. I also got another similar referral on that same lake a couple hrs ago.. Pretty sure I'll be pm ing you in the near future for some general fly in tips and such"
1070297,gordy28,2021-02-04 14:46:00,638,Awesome - I took a look at the Bounce Lake website  - nice new cabin and the fact that it seems booked solid is a good sign I would guess Enjoy - I know our first fly in was magical and I am sure you and your family will love it Andrew
1070304,Rizzo,2021-02-04 19:39:00,4754,"Amazing! I have never done a fly-in so have zero tips but I trust you will have a memorable experience! Congrats on this ""family time"" investment. If my wife even was remotely interested in fishing I would love to do something like this...but she isn't (which is weird because she sure seemed interested when we were just dating!)"
1070312,fishdawg,2021-02-04 23:46:00,912,"It's kinda funny Roger, my wife won't fish much at all here locally but loves to whenever we head north."
1070320,akaShag,2021-02-05 01:43:00,2073,tagged for interest......
1070325,Moosebunk,2021-02-05 04:03:00,3970,"Fished Snare Lake... think it was around 05?  And went in mid summer.  Was actually the first fly-in softwater trip I'd ever done.  The cabin you chose looks much nicer, the lake sounds a little deeper, you're going with family and it's gonna be great.  Being a small lake with worm harnesses, jigs and few diving cranks you'll be quick to sort out what works."
