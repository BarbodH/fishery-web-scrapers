997837,Big Cliff,2017-03-24 10:51:00,6899,"Do I still need an outdoor card? I have gone on line and spent over an hour looking and reading but I'm still not sure.  For starters I'm 71 so I know I don't need a fishing license anymore and I'm probably not going to be doing any more hunting, so do I still have to get an outdoor card to go fishing?  I need to know for sure BEFORE I go on this fly-in.  "
997840,Terry,2017-03-24 11:19:00,14456,in ontario you dont need card but you must carry id
997841,DanD,2017-03-24 11:23:00,2223,"I can't say for sure but out on Simcoe a few weeks back, a CO came into the hut asking for our licenses. My brother in-law who is also 71, just showed him his driver's license, for proof of age. The only comment from the CO to my brother was so you've been collecting cash for life the last 6 years. LOL  Dan."
997842,dave524,2017-03-24 11:32:00,4508,"I believe if you hunt after the age of 65 you will still need the card, fishing,  you are good to go without as long as you have ID for your age."
997854,bigugli,2017-03-24 12:59:00,6138,"From the summary  ""if they are: 1. Residents of Ontario and Canada under 18 years old, or 65 years of age or older and in possession of any licence, permit, certificate or identification card issued by the Government of Canada or a provincial or territorial government of Canada that indicates their name and date of birth.""  You just need to carry federal or provincial ID showing date of birth."

997947,Big Cliff,2017-03-24 23:48:00,6899,Thanks guys that's kind of what I gathered from reading what I could find but thought it better to ask than find out at the last minute.
997951,Acountdeleted,2017-03-25 00:31:00,2562,My grandfather says all you need is to prove you are from Ontario and over 65.  ......... my grandfather also says we should keep all the Muskie because they eat the walleye and bass. :/
