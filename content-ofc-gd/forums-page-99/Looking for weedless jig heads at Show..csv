996949,captpierre,2017-03-14 16:34:00,2521,Anybody know of good weedless jig heads to put grubs or swim baits on for eyes on the Kawarthas? Some days bucktails don't do the job. Going to the Sportsman Show. Who sells them there?

997185,muddler,2017-03-17 01:01:00,623,"Now don't laugh, but I use a small worm hook(ebay) and Texas rig my grub to be weedless just like a plastic worm. Depending on how much weight I need I pinch on a round earless splitshot up against the nose of the grub. Swims through just about anything and easy to rig. Cheap too.  Got a huge pile of sunken logs( like a couple of acres) on the Spanish river that I throw this rig into. I rarely get hung up, pull a lot of walleye out of there.  mud"
997190,captpierre,2017-03-17 01:31:00,2521,Gonna try it.
997192,muddler,2017-03-17 02:02:00,623,"If you do a search for ""39121 hook"" on ebay there is a size 2(about 1.25 inches long) worm hook with free shipping from China for about $8 for a 100. That's the size that I use. The split shot (earless) I buy at Walmart in various sizes (depending on the depth and drop speed I want).  The size 2 hook works real well on a 3 inch grub and size 0 splitshot is about 1/4 ounce or close to it.  The other option is to find some Charlie Brewer slider jigs. They made for small 3-4 inch worms for crappie but are excellent weedless grub rigs too. I haven't bought them in years because I felt they were too expensive back then. That's when I switched to a worm hook and split shot....way cheaper.  Good luck, Mud"
997193,GBW,2017-03-17 02:05:00,8460,Got a pic of that set up Mud?
997327,muddler,2017-03-19 00:28:00,623,Looks something like this one except I pinch on a splitshot. Same idea.  http://www.kevinwakeman.com/rigweedless.htm     Looks like the top one with a splitshot in front.  This also works but it takes me too long to rig in the boat and thehooks are too expensive for me.     mud
997335,GBW,2017-03-19 04:02:00,8460,"thanks mud, that's what I thought it would look like but I'm better with a pic.  Those Owner and other brand hooks with the keeper can add up in cost too (2ns pic)"
