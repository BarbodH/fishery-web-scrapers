Lots of ice here still, and a local lake that sucked for fishing the last few years has come alive again, its about a 20 minute drive down the trails from my house so makes a good destination once the kid is off the bus now we have daylight till 8pm.  Hit this spot up a few times in the last 2 weeks, here is the first video I made.    "
