997194,Locnar,2017-03-17 02:07:00,645,Cheese n crepes! That's terrifying. I don't ever plan on driving my vehicle on the ice...
997210,BillM,2017-03-17 12:55:00,17367,'Let's try here'  Bad choice!
997237,Sinker,2017-03-17 17:27:00,8692,"This video has been going around social media for days now. It should be titled what not to do on ice. I don't get why they would drive right into that crack. Its clear that it was open, and refroze a bit....trucks don't just plunge through the ice..... The driver does something stupid and ends up in a crack usually.  S."
997246,Joeytier,2017-03-17 19:19:00,3990,"Oh boy...Let's just drive over a pressure crack without even getting out of the vehicle and inspecting.  Like Sinker said, that lake has about 3 ft of ice on it right now, you don't through for no reason."
997248,ccmtcanada,2017-03-17 20:20:00,7971,Absolutely terrifying....  I'm always a bit jittery when I'm in a vehicle on the ice....I always have my seat belt off just in case I ever have to get out in a hurry....
997261,PUMP KNOWS,2017-03-17 22:49:00,937,Bail bail  Why are they driving on the ice?
997264,Fisherman,2017-03-17 23:19:00,7201,You can't fix stupid.
997271,GBW,2017-03-18 01:09:00,8460,I'm always a bit jittery when I'm in a vehicle on the ice....I always have my seat belt off just in case I ever have to get out in a hurry.... And the door open a crack with the radio off...
997272,manitoubass2,2017-03-18 01:18:00,11391,Anyone watch the myth busters episode about getting out of a submerged vehicle?  If not you should
997275,PUMP KNOWS,2017-03-18 01:58:00,937,I had to YT it  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YaMEW30bv4
997277,manitoubass2,2017-03-18 02:21:00,11391,That's just a snippet. They talk about the ways to actually get out and it's good info
997297,Fisherman,2017-03-18 17:37:00,7201,"Anyone watch the myth busters episode about getting out of a submerged vehicle?  If not you should I think there's a ""bit"" of difference when the waters 33F and your dressed with winter clothes."
997298,manitoubass2,2017-03-18 18:07:00,11391,"Of course there is. Still doesn't change the basic ""how the hell do I get out of a submerged vehicle"" aspect  A jacket and snowpants doesn't change that lol"
997329,scuro2,2017-03-19 02:04:00,904,"When she said, that's my life...take it, what was she referring too?"
