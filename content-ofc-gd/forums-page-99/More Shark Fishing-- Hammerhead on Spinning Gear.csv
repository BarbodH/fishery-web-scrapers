The rod goes off and we quickly realized we were not dealing with a blacktip. This shark was taking 150 yard runs 20 minutes into the fight against 30lbs of drag like it was nothing. We got it in after about 40 minutes. The shark was not removed from the water, the hook was cut to keep everything quick, and the shark swam off strong. Epic night, check it out!  "
