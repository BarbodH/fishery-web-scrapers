Resort or private cottage on the water (obviously) within a short drive (i dunno 30-45min drive ish).  Looks like lakers & pike will be the target species due to the time of year.  Any suggestions for that area?"

Theres a place called Muskys Landing literally the next exit north off of the 400. I have never stayed there but it is right on the water."

Can't wait, the month of May is a crap show with business, family and a zone 17 Walleye opener tourny.  Last week of April it must be and I'm looking to make the most of it"
