My biggest walleye ever was up there on a spinnerbait, 28 inches around 8 pounds, a September fatty. Slow rolling a 3/8 ounce chartreuse & blue down a point."

997204,Garnet,2017-03-17 12:00:00,2056,What colour of black bucktail are you using.
997262,Mister G,2017-03-17 23:14:00,1429,"NORMALLY, just after spawn walleyes are in a recoup mode and you will be fishing for males still hanging around the shallows.  This means LOW light conditions are best on reefs where minnows might be active . . . .  so about  4 - 4:30 am starts casting #11 floating Rapala's to give off more sutlle vibrations when it's dark and cold plus they cast further.  Don't be afraid to cast into 1-2' of water . . .  When light hits, it's time to use 1/8 oz dark all black bucktail jigs . . . . . the winder the better . . . . if you have 2' waves breaking into shoals, you have the spot on the spot and might be able to just drift said jigs.  You never heard any of this from the G man............................."
997282,fish_fishburn,2017-03-18 12:04:00,1311,Mb2 I use the exact tactics as you do. On opening day Im fishing a large river 3rd sat in may. Sometimes they can be really hard to find on O day. So many variables to deal with river fishing. All my biggest walleye have been caught mid day in under 5 ft while chasing Northerns.
997283,fish_fishburn,2017-03-18 12:06:00,1311,The J11 J13 work really well. That wide wobble drives em nuts.

997035,captpierre,2017-03-15 15:29:00,2521,"I have better luck on the Kawarthas in June. They hang around healthy weeds. Typical use smaller jigs with grubs or minnows in the early season. I think a slower presentation in the cold water is preferred. Light line. I prefer natural colours. Some guys like white, yellow or chartreuse. Don't know about Shield lakes."
997039,OhioFisherman,2017-03-15 16:15:00,6623,"When does your season open? Cold water is sort of a relative term? They spawn before bass and are more active in cooler water than bass? I have caught them here in Ohio casting and trolling crankbaits in 6-10 feet deep in April, they hadn't moved too far from their spawning areas."
997045,Musky Plug,2017-03-15 16:36:00,398,The season opener for the kawarthas is the 2nd Saturday in may. Last year from what I can remember it was fairly warm? Not sure about water temps however. Was looking at some pics from my trip from opener last year and I was in shorts and tee.
997051,Sinker,2017-03-15 16:56:00,8692,"Bucktails, and slow, slow retrieves with deep diving cranks along weed edges or anywhere you can find weeds.  S."
997055,GBW,2017-03-15 17:39:00,8460,I have luck casting jig/grub's and dark bucktail jig's as Sinker said as well as in transition areas.  Rocky shallow to a deeper drop off
997056,manitoubass2,2017-03-15 17:50:00,11391,"My favorite in early spring is shallow, right off or in the spawning areas.  Kalina grubs on a jighead, 3"" Berkely ripple shads show rolled on a jighead, and bucktails.  I focus on a shallow Rocky shoal just off and Eddie, casting/retrieve from 15fow to 2fow later in the day  I'll switch up these 3 lures throughout the day.  I'll also cast a husky jerk right up to shore and retrieve slow with pauses  Or occasionally the rapala minnow in black/gold.  The husky jerk us green/orange belly  Ripple shads in chartruesse  Kalins grubs in bluegill  Jig heads are always black"
997059,Headhunter,2017-03-15 18:50:00,5703,Small and slow and look for warmer water at the edge of drop offs. HH

997116,Beans,2017-03-16 12:11:00,3339,"From opening and for a couple of weeks after on Rice Lake we would jump in the boat after supper, motor out to one of the islands, beach the boat and then pull on our chest waders...  We would then proceed to cast a Rapala into the westerly wind while standing in the water...usually got our limit each just before and after dark...We kept them on a stringer tied to our belt..."
997121,AKRISONER,2017-03-16 13:15:00,5558,im finding water close to where they spawned...anywhere that bottle necks them on their journey back to the main lake. Im rigging drop shotted minnows or dragging worm harnesses in 15-25 fow.  the edge of new weed growth is always a great idea and I found that the best fishing in the spring for them happens on the May 2/4.  same goes for pike thats when we really hammer eyes and pike. Everything is congregated near those new weeds.
997134,BillM,2017-03-16 16:19:00,17367,"One of my best patterns is slow rolling big spinnerbaits over rocky flats, say anywhere from 10-15ft of water.   I've caught some giants doing this."
997138,manitoubass2,2017-03-16 16:55:00,11391,"Like walleye spinnerbaits or bass spinnerbaits???  I started using bass spinnerbaits a few years back, and used at the right time, boy do they hammer walleye  Also, using that method(I cast them but not much difference) you'll almost never lose a walleye on a spinnerbait.  My favs are chartruesse, and black/silver 3/8 oz potbellies"

I have a photo of one around lbs from that day too. Impossible to find since my Photobucket crapped the bed  And yep it's from shore fishing solo, so the pic sucks lol  "
997144,Slimbo85,2017-03-16 18:06:00,17,great tips guys thanks for sharing  quick question as i cant find anything in the regulations or online  last year some guy told me your not allowed to use minnows on the trent severn (big chute to severn falls) is this true?
997145,AKRISONER,2017-03-16 18:26:00,5558,i very very highly doubt it. there are very few bait restricted areas in Ontario aside from parks. I could be wrong though! the biggest regulations are usually related to fish sanctuaries with extended closed seasons.
997149,BillM,2017-03-16 18:58:00,17367,"There's nothing in the exceptions about the Severn from the falls down to Big Chute if I can remember, definitely nothing about bait.  Rick, I run the big 3/8oz bass spinnerbaits, nothing fancy.   Although I find running willowblades helps with getting down and staying down compared to colorados."
997150,manitoubass2,2017-03-16 19:05:00,11391,"Same here. When ya say ""slow rolling"" this is the definition lol. Half a crank too fast and the lure surface too quickly.  I only use willows, or a Colorado Willow combo but boy ya gotta reel slow on that one!"
