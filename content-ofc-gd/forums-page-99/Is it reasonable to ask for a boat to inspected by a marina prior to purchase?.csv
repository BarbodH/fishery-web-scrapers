997596,Tjames09,2017-03-22 04:19:00,664,"As per my other thread, Im looking for a boat. Used seems to be the direction as new doesnt get me a lot. Ive seen a few boats that are what Im looking for, but the boats are between 10 and 15 years old. How would I go about getting the seller to bring the boat to a marina for an inspection? Is this a reasonable request? I dont mind paying for it. Id imagine if the seller is not willing to do this then the boat probably has problems?"
997597,GBW,2017-03-22 04:42:00,8460,Never a problem to ask.  But when the lakes open up a water test is great for the feel of the boat also.
997598,Big Cliff,2017-03-22 07:20:00,6899,"Well if you are going to have it inspected by a marina then you would be paying for it however that would be money well spent. You don't have a lot of experience with boats so even doing a water test in your case wouldn't really tell you much and you could easily miss a problem. If a seller won't let you get it checked out, walk away."
997600,spincast,2017-03-22 10:41:00,3279,"absolutely essential. Compression test on the motor, and a sea test at a minimum. As you want the results, its your cost and your choice of marina. Telll them you are considering buying it and want a full inspection."
997603,Canuck,2017-03-22 10:57:00,491,Agreed with the above 100%. Have a marine mechanic do a mechanical inspection.  Get your own mechanic.  Don't use the one the seller recommends.  Ask for all of the service records.  Owners that take care of their stuff also keep their service records.  You can get a marine surveyor to do an inspection too.  For a smaller boat it might be cheaper.  Either that or bring along an experienced helper since you will probably have a boner you can't see past.  Someone without spring fever will be more balanced and will see more of the crap you will miss.

Can someone actually recommend a marina on Pigeon lake? Thats where the boat im interested in is located."
997649,aplumma,2017-03-22 18:23:00,6896,You really want a marine survey. Contact your insurance company for nams in your area. The charge will be more than a mechanic but he will inspect the whole boat and offer an honest evaluation on how the whole boat is.   Art
997672,captpierre,2017-03-22 20:59:00,2521,The only on-the-water marina I know on Pigeon Lake is Gannon Narrows Marina. My neighbour uses their services and is happy
997686,Canuck,2017-03-22 23:54:00,491,There are mobile marine mechanics as well.  They will go to the boat.  A marine survey will not normally include a mechanical inspection of the motor though.  They may be able to recommend a mechanic they work with though..
997690,Smokercrafty,2017-03-23 01:14:00,227,"From what I've seen from Marine mechanics, make sure they're reputable, otherwise, they'll ALL be happy to take your cash for a less than par service."
997704,Tjames09,2017-03-23 04:00:00,664,"Thanks guys.  Im not sure how people are buying and selling boats on Kijiji or trader right now, all the lakes are still frozen. Is everyone buying boats without any sort of test run? There a re some boats im interested in, but the lakes still have weeks or more before ice is gone for a boat to be run on them."
997705,GBW,2017-03-23 04:55:00,8460,"A boat can be started with ""muff's"" to provide water into the impeller to test that it in fact runs.  And people are trying now to get top dollar as the open water season is coming close so post it now to gain interest or sell.  Same boat could have gone for less in the fall as the person wanted it gone so to say..."

A lot of boat deals are made conditional on 'an acceptable sea trial' once the ice is gone.  That way the deal is done and everybody is happy presuming there are not major issues during the test."
