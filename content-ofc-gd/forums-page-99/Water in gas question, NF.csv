997318,chris.brock,2017-03-18 21:28:00,4053," I had lots of boat gas left over after the season so I transferred it into jerry cans for use in snowmobiles, ATV or whatever.  In December the fuel system on my snowmobile froze on the boat gas. I drained that gas, added de-icer and fresh gas and it's fine again so I'm thinking there's water in the boat gas.  I've got quite a few jerry cans and don't know which ones have boat gas.  Can I siphon out the top portion of those cans and if there's water it will stay in the bottom? Is it worth the risk?  It's all premium, no ethanol gas with stabil. Any input appreciated."
997319,irishfield,2017-03-18 21:38:00,26272,"Grab a plastic 60 oz booze bottle. Funnel the fuel into same. Let it sit for a few minutes and it will separate. Fuel on top, water on bottom. Slowly pour the fuel out into an empty can, leaving a safe margin when you pour.. dump the water. Repeat. Had to do this for about 7 neighbours the summer of 2014 and the wife's boat that all got crap gas at the local dispensary!"

997323,wdodgetruck,2017-03-18 23:47:00,27,A marine mechanic suggested the we run K100 in our boat fuel . He has seen a lot of rusted fuel pumps from ethanol fuel .
997345,Big Cliff,2017-03-19 10:16:00,6899,"Also, if you are using premium fuel you don't need to put any conditioner in the fuel, in fact I would stay away from it. The other thing that often causes problems is that people leave tanks half empty, think about it:  It's a beautiful warm day, relative humidity is lets say 80%, you spend a day fishing or what ever. Now you get home and put the boat away, your tank is maybe 1/2 full but the other half of your tank is 1/2 full of warm moist air. Things cool down the moisture condenses..... get the picture. The best way to avoid this is to fill your tank up before you put it away (goes for almost every thing but mostly equipment used in warm humid conditions)."
997350,floater,2017-03-19 11:59:00,220,I was in the same boat last year! 200 liters of water contaminated gas. I tried running it through a fuel water separator and then I put it into my truck. And the truck died! I ended up taking it to the dump! Hope your Rye method works!
