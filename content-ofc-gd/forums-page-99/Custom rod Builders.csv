The folks at Rainshadow have been great but unfortunitly it looks like I will need to get a new one tied on an updated Blank. Id like to keep the reel seat(wood), cork , and as many other original componants as possible as it holds sentimental value . I want my boy to fish it one day. Originally came from  Backwoods rods in Wasaga , no idea who builds them though. Im looking for someone to rebuild this thing with a supplied blank and components . Thoughts ? Pms welcome . Thanks, Ryan"
992935,grimsbylander,2017-01-27 23:54:00,3016,I would have a chat with Spiel...right here on OFC. He'll help you out or point you in the right direction.
992937,porkpie,2017-01-27 23:58:00,2521,"Chris or Spiel, one of the board owners will take care of what you need.  He built a very special Sage 1136 for me and I'm very happy with it,"
992940,MJL,2017-01-28 00:09:00,2427,"I would definitely get in contact with Spiel. Out of the 12 or 13 float rods I own, Spiel has fully built 2 float rods (CTS, Sage One), did the bottom end of 1 float rod (Rainshadow XST) and supplied me with a couple reel seats for my own builds when I had time. Definitely recommended. Keep in mind he is busy with orders.  Backwoods rods used to do a lot of promoting on this forum back in the day. I believe Dan Sturges is the guy behind the company."
992957,wormdunker,2017-01-28 03:45:00,1711,Yup Spiel is your man!  He lives in Hamilton.
992975,Spiel,2017-01-28 16:47:00,9065,"Shoot me a PM, I can definitely help you."
997255,Rustic-Fisher,2017-03-17 21:55:00,826,"Update.... Rainshadow stands behind their product 100% , couldn't provide the identicle blank the original rod was tied on ,SO provided an updated Blank for 34.00$ ....  deffinitly can't complain about that . As far as rod building companys ........ choose wisely ! I went against all opinions here to save a few bucks ....... lesson learned . Spiel check your PMs gonna need a few rods tied LOL."
997266,aplumma,2017-03-17 23:31:00,6896,You might be able to talk Spiel into twisting up a few rods for you and as you said you pay what you get. I Have been very fortunate that he has made the time to build a few rods for me. You can view some of his work on his facebook page.  Spiel Custom-Rod's photos.  Art
