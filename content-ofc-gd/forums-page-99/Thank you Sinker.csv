997114,Big Cliff,2017-03-16 08:51:00,6899,"Got a text yesterday from Sinker, he was out fishing and wanted to know if I would like a white fish for my smoker if he managed to catch one; OMG yes, I'd love one!  Well sure enough not 5 minutes later I got a text, ""got one going to try for two""; SUPER!  About 4:15 Sinker comes walking up to the door with two beautiful white fish for me, within 10 minutes they were cleaned and soaking in salt water in the fridge, I'll be prepping them for the smoker later on today. (anyone got a ""to die for"" recipe for smoking white fish, I'm always looking for something better)  Thank you my friend, I really appreciate you thinking of me and taking the time to drop them off to me!"
997115,oldphart,2017-03-16 12:09:00,665,~~~A real good buddie to have
997119,Sinker,2017-03-16 13:05:00,8692,Anytime Cliff!! I'm going to steal your recipe. I have a brand new smoker and haven't even tried it. LOL   S.

997153,Weeds,2017-03-16 19:20:00,782,"Yum. Smoked fish, apple juice, soya and spices sounds awesome. Got me craving something salty. I'm envious."
997157,GBW,2017-03-16 20:22:00,8460,"Brine: Soy, water, honey, sweet chili tai, pinch of brown sugar and then diced jalapeno peppers *edit to add* the wood used for smoking is key.  I like apple & black cherry in the smoker together"
997159,manitoubass2,2017-03-16 20:26:00,11391,Had me at at sweet chilli Tai. I use that on alot of foods. Sooooo good
997160,GBW,2017-03-16 20:27:00,8460,"Cliff, the above is how I smoked the walleye you loved at my place.  I make the brine and keep some in a spray container to mist on the fish as it's being smoked to keep it moist.  The fish rest's in that brine for 24hrs with the peppers resting on the flesh"
997161,GBW,2017-03-16 20:28:00,8460,Had me at at sweet chilli Tai. I use that on alot of foods. Sooooo good The smoker and stir try is the only reason I have it but yes it's great
997167,Shloim,2017-03-16 21:03:00,515,I think Sinker needs to know where I live too....lol

997430,fish_fishburn,2017-03-20 17:17:00,1311,Brine=1 gallon water 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup of kosher salt. That's all you need.
997436,Big Cliff,2017-03-20 18:58:00,6899,"Brine=1 gallon water 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup of kosher salt. That's all you need. Hot smoke I assume, what wood have you used, how hot, how long?  This my first time doing white fish, I do lots of salmon and trout but I cold smoke them. Right now I have the fillets vac packed and in the freezer until it's warm enough to do it outside (Sue really does love me but she still won't let me smoke stuff in the house (no, not even that  )"
