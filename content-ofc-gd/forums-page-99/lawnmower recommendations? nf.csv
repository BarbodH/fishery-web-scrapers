997557,leaf4,2017-03-21 21:51:00,2466,"Looking into getting a gas mower, leaning towards a Toro or a John Deere I've come across on kijiji. Just looking for any input on the brands and their reliability/longevity.   Toro is a 20332C John Deere is a JS40  Thanks!"
997560,scugpg,2017-03-21 22:19:00,1373,"Toro or Honda with aluminum deck. I own the js20 and although it's lasted 10yrs without any issues, I find it heavy(steel deck) and clunky to manoeuvre around the yard. But it is fast and powerful. Never used the bag always just the mulch and does a decent job. Imagine the Honda or Toro is even better there."

997571,leaf4,2017-03-21 23:27:00,2466,Lol that's what my dad said too haha
997573,misfish,2017-03-21 23:57:00,29133,Lol that's what my dad said too haha  So you have your answer then. LOL
997574,captpierre,2017-03-22 00:30:00,2521,I see an add for a new electric 40 volt unit at Home Depot on TV.
997577,leaf4,2017-03-22 00:40:00,2466,"Not sure what to think of those, I have a decent size lot (corner) it's 50' wide by 150 deep, not sure that it would last the entire time, or have the torque a gas mower provides... I know at my last house where I had a corded electric mower if I left it a couple days too long I'd have to start off in a higher setting then bring it down on a second pass"
997579,Kawartha Kev,2017-03-22 01:09:00,281,I have an older model Toro Super recycler model about 7 or 8 years old never a problem starts first or 2nd pull every time but is not self propelled. I have flat land so need for self propelled models just something else to go wrong imho but love the Toro have heard bad things about JD's.  Kawartha Kev
997581,leaf4,2017-03-22 01:18:00,2466,"Actually I just came across a super recycler... With self propel, which would be nice as I have a hill leading down to the sidewalk. Thanks"
997582,Kawartha Kev,2017-03-22 01:40:00,281,The super recycler is kind of like a mulching mower on steroids!! It cuts the clippings very fine and have had to do very little maintenance on it just top up the oil and clean the air filter a couple times that's it.  Kawartha Kev
997585,woodenboater,2017-03-22 01:57:00,2277,"whatever brand u get, make sure to get a self propelled one. oh yeah, I have a Lawn-Boy. no complaints"

997599,Big Cliff,2017-03-22 07:25:00,6899,"Personally I would go with the Toro, I find Honda really good but over priced, JD; well a lot of their stuff now comes from off shore and the quality isn't what it use to be but the prices are still up there."
997602,dave524,2017-03-22 10:53:00,4508,"It's just like Tohatsu making a lot of the small outboards that are rebranded by Big Name big price companies, MTD makes CTC, Troybuilt, Yard Machine among others and their own brand. On my 4th mower in 35 years with years left in it, I cut a 75 x 175 foot lot, buy cheap, do basic maintenance , if a repair is beyond your abilities, it is best to trash it and buy again as shop fees are outta sight  I'm running one of these now , good mower without sticker shock and watch it comes on sale.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/yard-machines-140cc-3-in-1-gas-lawn-mower-21-in-2992929p.html#srp"
997605,NANUK,2017-03-22 11:46:00,797,A self propelled Honda.
997606,leaf4,2017-03-22 12:13:00,2466,Found one of these for $300. Going to look at it on Saturday morning  https://www.toro.com/en-CA/homeowner/walk-behind-mowers/22-personal-pace-20332
997609,Dara,2017-03-22 13:05:00,3052,I got a Husqvarna a few years ago. I love that mower. Its easier to handle than a self propelled. They have bearings in the wheels that makes it super easy to push. I have about the same size yard as you  with a bit of a hill. Its also the only mower I have seen that the bag is tapered the right way. The big end is at the opening so clippings drop out instead of wedging in there

I started with the bigger is better mentality when buying to later realize smaller, simpler units are easier to handle and fix.  This is what I was going to say. I hate the big self propelled units personally. I'd rather have a cheap, light unit that's easy to fix.  I have a husky riding more that is amazing. Love it. My push mower is an old lawn boy 2 stroker that just won't die.  S."
