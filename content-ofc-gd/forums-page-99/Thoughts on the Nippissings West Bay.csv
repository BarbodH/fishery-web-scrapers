On our first trip two years ago, we saw six muskie....landing two, and breaking the rod on another (likely a flaw in the rod). However, all our muskie action was on the West Arm. Of the bass we caught, I'd say they were evenly split between the Arm and the Bay. Due to the better muskie sightings, we probably fished the Arm 60% of the time.  We would really like to learn the Bay better, but are wondering if the discolored water that time of year, or the relatively shallow depths, lower fishing results other than early and later in the season.  Any thoughts from folks who fish those waters?  Thanks in advance."
