997767,DRIFTER_016,2017-03-23 15:09:00,10439,If you somehow have to drive at night on 17 you would be wise to follow behind a semi truck.. They can hit the Moose for you.. We drove up 11 on a night with little traffic and almost paid for it with our lives when a cow moose ran out in front of us.. I could see the white of her eyes.. I bet they were as bugged out as ours were.. Lol  17 is nothing compared to Manitoulin Is. or the Northern Rockies in BC.

997553,huzzsaba,2017-03-21 21:35:00,884,"This Summer (End of June-Beginning of July) the plan is to drive across Canada with the family from GTA to Edmonton to visit my parents, followed by Calgary and Banff. Then make the trip back.  We will stick to driving through Canada only so on the way there, we will be stopping overnight in hotels in Sault Ste Marie, (hopefully do some nightime walleye fishing  ), Thunder Bay, and then a town called Moosomin in SK.  Finally reaching our destination in Edmonton. We stay in Edmonton for a few nights and then continue to Calgary for a night then spend 2 nights camping in Bow Valley Provincial park right outside Banff.  On the way back the plan is to make stops in Medicine Hat,Winnipeg, and then 2 nights camping in Sleeping Giant Provincial park.  Then finally another night in Sault Ste Marie before finally returning back home.  Feel free to share some tips or must see places on the way.  We usually keep our own food, so anything besides food or drink related attractions would be great.  Also any fishing tips would be appreciated especially if anyone is familiar with Bow Valley PP and Sleeping Giant PP.  I believe both places we have campsite right on the water so hopefully that should help catch a fish or 2.  I have been dreaming of making a cross Canada trip for the longest time. Hoping to make the best of it  ."

997580,MJL,2017-03-22 01:12:00,2427,"My dad and I did Toronto to Vancouver in 2014...The moment you cross the Ontario border, it's a pretty long and uneventful grassy drive till you hit Calgary.  And yes, there are cops in the prairies...We were advised to keep it 119 and under (Speed limit is 110 km/hr)...My dad got pulled over just outside of Medicine hat with only a warning.LOL  Some tips:  - Bring more than 1 CD in the car (I won't make that mistake again.LOL) - Gas stations in Northern Ontario can be long distances away from each other. If a sign says you should gas up now, you probably should. - I would avoid driving at night in the rural areas. We saw a few flipped over cars on our journey because people swerved into the ditch to avoid hitting deer and other animals. The truckers in SK warned us about the Pronghorn antelope.  If I was in Edmonton and had to go to Calgary, I would take the more scenic (but longer route) through Jasper and Banff before hitting Calgary. It's an amazingly beautiful drive. You need a National parks fishing license on top of the Alberta fishing license if you plan to fish in Banff or Jasper - It's $9 per day on top of the regular Alberta fishing license. I only caught a few small rainbows and the odd mountain whitefish when I fished the road side creeks and rivers.  Sault Ste Marie is a city made for fisherman. Perhaps my 2nd favourite fishing spot on our trip. Aside from the walleyes, there are steelhead in the rapids all year long. The city seems so welcoming to anglers. The biting insects are pretty vicious though.LOL  It's a trip I would love to do again! "
997621,BillM,2017-03-22 15:15:00,17367,"Crazy Mike, I saw one cop from Lethbridge to Winnipeg.   I also averaged probably 160-170 the entire way, lol (Although this car was made for it  )   I guess I got lucky!"

What MJL said about the fishing.  leave to head north in the morning..as nice as the Rockies are, The trip from Sault to Thunder bay is a close second You don't want to miss it driving at night"
997643,Acountdeleted,2017-03-22 18:07:00,2562,"If you go a little past Edmonton, the Pembina provincial park is awsome. It's like a natural lazy river complete with guys renting tubes.  Fishing is great in Dryden and nicest people I have met in my life. Take the 17 rather then the 11 to Thunder Bay. Most beautiful view we have in Canada. If you can start your trip going to Tobermory then taking the Chi-Chi mun to the manatoulin island, highly reccomended.  When I think of more I'll add to this."
997648,BillM,2017-03-22 18:23:00,17367,"Yeah, you won't miss anything taking 17 instead of 11.   The view along 17 from the Sault to TBay is fantastic.  Make sure to do that during the day."

Agreed. Once upon a time, Hearst Ontario had the best hamburgers I had ever eaten in my life at a little chip stand called Mikos. It was a debate if I would take the 11 or the 17 (yes, the burgers were that good). Last time, coming back from Edmonton in 2014, I decided to go the 11 route for my fill. The stand had been sold by the family to someone else. They insisted that the recipe had been sold along with the stand, but it was clear some secrets live and die with the ones who created them. It was never the same, and not worth the detour. Make sure to give extra time along the 17 from Sault to Thunder Bay. Lots of scenic viewpoints with parking you will want to stop and 'stretch your legs' at."

The first trip there though is interesting. The prairies are still definitely something to see. I thought that the battlefords were always pretty neat...it is what you make of it. Even lloydminister can be interesting if you see the provincial border in the middle of town.   if you are driving to calgary via edmonton, i would do so by driving through drumheller...the badlands are friggin crazy  the calgary to banff drive...phh just drive it...your jaw will basically be on the floor once you hit bow valley.  I would also highly highly recommend driving the ice fields parkway towards jasper even if you turn back after getting to the crow foot glacier and the columbia ice fields. That is probably the most incredible drive anyone can ever do. It only takes an afternoon and is totally worth it."

MJL, lots of tips.  Thanks.  I will definitely not forget the cds as well as the DVD player for the kids! Best defense against the constant ""are we there yet""  question lol.  Akrisoner, I was thinking of skipping the drive from Edmonton- Jasper-banff,  and just doing Calgary to banff,  however looks like Jasper will have to be part of the itinerary as per your recommendation  Bill, Definitely taking the 17 all the way to thunder bay.  thanks.  Jeremy, I was thinking of going to manitoulin first, but may do that at another time this summer. Went there 2 years ago and can't wait to go back!  Dara, we will check out the museum.  Also we plan to do most of the driving from 8am to 8pm.  Hopefully we shouldn't miss any good scenic spots due to nightime."

It can be a bit scary (Especially in the spring) but you really just need to pay attention and have some good lighting on your vehicle.  Personally I'd be more worried about the other truck drivers (Been almost taken out by them a few times) then I would the moose.

997750,Acountdeleted,2017-03-23 14:16:00,2562,"This is the best advice I can give as someone who drove a sedan from Thunder Bay to Toronto for 4 summers. If you drive at night, find an 18 wheeler, give er space and let her set the pace. Going 10 below the speed limit is ok if it means you get there in one piece."
