993332,AKRISONER,2017-02-03 13:18:00,5558,"^^^ can't feel it on these two.  First one has a good message if I'm hearing it right  Had to cleanse the pallette lol    lol opposite reaction to czarface  to me its too rippity rap...if you feel me. Rapping about rapping kinda ish without the timelessness of something like the PR and CL.  TDE is the forefront of where rap is going right now...it definitely takes some adjusting, but if youve listened to To Pimp a Butterfly it was pretty obvious the whole sound was about to change and subsequently has.  crazy enough I give huggggeee credit to flying lotus for be revolutionary in that sense. You can see his influence all over the entire hip hop game now and dude was producing these sounds 10 years ago. Very interesting indeed."

986414,AKRISONER,2016-11-16 19:12:00,5558,"exactly...its so rare to see a legendary performer(s) put out incredible work later in their career. the last group ive seen do this was Band of Horses, their first two albums are the best but their most recent and like 6th album is #3  Wanna talk about a late emergence, look at El-P the guy reached superstardom 30 years into his career after putting out like 15 albums!"

987372,AKRISONER,2016-11-28 13:36:00,5558,it actually was #1 on billboard if you can believe it....real hip hop #1 on billboard...
987399,manitoubass2,2016-11-28 18:11:00,11391,Sick!!!!
988355,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-11 05:56:00,8243,"Coming from a 62 year old I sometimes enjoy the genre and sometimes I think it is unadulterated crap. If inflaming with specific words is Art I sometimes don't see it. N word this, F this and that. Can't one evoke emotion within me without this type of language? Art in my opinion is evoking an emotion from a person, listening, seeing, touching, watching.  This is supposed to be a G rated site. I'm sure Art hasn't seen most of this stuff. It sure is as or more inflammatory than criticizing politicians.  It is a long way from when I was a kid watching American Bandstand. ""Yes Dick, it has a nice beat and I can dance to it easy'. That was mostly crap too. You never saw Hendrix on ABS. Now I must say, I do like most Hip Hop, it is the poetry today that was once the poetry of the 60's even into the 70's, including Mitchel, Dylan, Jagger and Lennon and McCartney et all. I get that. The language used throughout most Hip Hop is not needed to get the blood flowing in someone listening, to evoke emotion, is distain an emotion? I think the language is just a crutch for bad music often.  That just my old greying head's opinion."
988371,manitoubass2,2016-12-11 13:42:00,11391,"  Alot of hip hop doesnt use excessive foul language, lots does.  Rap however, well i urge you to stear clear, especially ""gangsta rap"", oh or Necro lol"
988452,AKRISONER,2016-12-12 13:37:00,5558,"can someone get this guy some positive rap please?  Iron, here is the complete opposite end of the spectrum, have a listen    Iron, to be honest, most hip-hop is a product of its environment. The swearing is not in the music simply because its trying to sound tough...the music literally is a reflection of the streets that its growing up on.  Think of how guys on the job site spoke. Same thing. Big L laid it out simply ""speak with criminal slang, thats just the way that i talk yo"".    Big L wasnt rapping like this as an act...dude grew up in harlem and was a gangster through and through...both him and his brother were murdered.  Obviously it can be very difficult to connect with someone's whos reality is the streets, but thats what makes it appealing, its like someone telling a story about something that you couldnt imagine living. You obviously dont have to like it, but thats the reason for the language, these guys know no different."
988454,AKRISONER,2016-12-12 13:59:00,5558,"also this track is for you manitou...i know youve been hurting so this track will get your ass up    that ending though ""we need to go back in time to when muhfukas could rock"""

I saw them in a crowd of about 50 people and stood against the stage. Every single person in the joint knew every single word.  When they did raspberry fields bascially it was just everyone rapping with them. Cool experience."

The only Rappers I remember are The Sugarland something, ""Rappers Delight"" and of course Blondie. Does she count? I think her Rap on that song was one of the first recorded. I really do like some of the stuff. My favorites are not gang related. I can't connect with it. The Reggae based Rap from Jamaican bands gets me moving, slow but moving. ""Booliaca, bang bang, when I see a pretty woman walkin' down the street Mon booliaca booliaca bang bang"". Not bad for someone collecting CPP and has a Handicap placard."

Iron you gotta know Run DMC right? I mean they were jamming with Aerosmith

Not sure how much i believe this part, but  when Guru died aparently his entire estate went to some mysterious man, who many believe was actually Guru's ""partner"" and secretly there was romantic tension between all of this.  pretty wild."

He caused alot of beef between guru and premier and sounded like a real arse.  I believe solar even collects gurus royalties from gangstarr, so if anyone owns his estate Im sure its solar.
