We had a quick border crossing both ways and an easy 3 1/2 hour trip to and from. The show was great and beyond my expectations, very friendly, both the crowd and exhibiters. I inquired at the Canada map sales booth about an obscure lake in Quebec, the lady rep. couldn't find it in their indexes, she left her booth and went to the outfitter who flew into this lake and got co-ordinates, came back found the lake on her computer. She said they have a show special, 12.00 shipped to my home, WOW talk about great service . Made contact with 2 outfitters on Kabinakagami Lake who fly in from White River, had long and informative conversations with both and will soon book a trip. Visited several lure makers and sellers, bought a few, looked at many boat and motor combinations and went to the food court for several snacks.
