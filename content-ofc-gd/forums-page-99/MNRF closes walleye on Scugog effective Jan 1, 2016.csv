Doesn't make sense but then again never know till they make it crystal clear as I'm sure they will need to make special regs in 65 different languages so that so called fishermen are aware of this ......

It,s makes it easy to inforce poachers then. You see an angler on a closed river or lake,theres no way to get out of a charge. Well Im sure they will try to think of one.  We all wish we had the right answer.  Like I said, thinking outside the box and JMO.

947054,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-30 12:59:00,4399,The MNR should hire Sinker and Mr.G...my opinions are just my opinions and are based on 30 of fishing the lake and I really dont care to get into a long winded discusion about it the facts are out there to read if one wants too. And I will also add... in my humble opinion the the introduction on non native species has done more harm and will continue to do more harm to the kawartha's than some guy in a 12 foot tinny will every do!!
947060,Sinker,2015-11-30 14:20:00,8692,"Well, saying that crappies have ruined the walleye fishery forever is a bold statement. And scugog has always been weedy, no more now than ever, and the weeds are what keeps the scugog walleye happy. Shallow water with no weeds and those fish wouldn't make it in there.  So, if you want to provide some facts about your statements, I'm all ears. I have an open mind. I've also lived here for 30 years, and seen it happen.  Yes, invasive species have a role for sure. That said, invasives come to a new area, explode, have their impact, then return to a sustainable population. All the kawartha lakes have gone thru this change. It started in rice, and worked its way thru the system. Scugog was the last to get hit, and why its the only lake thats not on a rebound right now.  When crappies came to rice, they exploded. In turn, the walleyes dropped off. A few years pass, the crappies are hard to get in any numbers, but the walleye fishing is fantastic.  Next up was the tri-lakes.....same deal....crappies and zebras get in, crappies explode, walleyes decline. 3-4 yrs later, crappies have leveled off, and walleyes are coming back in good numbers with several year classes.  Next was sturgeon.....wash, rinse, repeat....exact same deal. Sturgeon is now on the rebound.  I'm no scientist, or biologist, but I live here, and have fished these lakes most of my life. I'm not saying anyone is wrong or right, just what I've seen from years of experience on the water where I LIVE.  I still think the trent severn has a lot more to do with actual RECRUITMENT than any other environmental impact. If the water levels are played with when the fish spawn, that year class is done. No walleyes.  Pretty straight forward I think, but I'm open to other ideas.  S."
947061,crappieperchhunter,2015-11-30 14:22:00,2582,"I started fishing the bog through the ice in the 80's. Back then if you where in an area holding walleye and you had half a clue you could get your limit pretty much every trip out. And all you had to fish was 30-40 minutes as the sun was going down in the evening. It was that good. 10 plus fish  at dusk was pretty common. Some of my best fishing memories are from the evening walleye bites through the ice out from Goreski's.  By my observations, 4 things have changed drastically since then.  First thing was way more people started coming out. Within a 3-5 year span I would say winter fishing pressure doubled...at least. I blame this on 2 things. The internet and the invention of portable huts.  Second thing crappie started to show up. I have read several things published about how crappie are a very heavy predator on walleye fry. Take from that what you will. But when word got out that the Bog was producing some awesome crappie catches that also increased the fishing pressure again .....a whole bunch. And many of these new arrivals targeting crappie where not really fishermen at all IMHO...just meat hunters...plain and simple.  Third thing I noticed was weeds.  Way way more weeds. Some areas I fished became unfishable. You could cut 8-10 holes before you found an open area where your bait could actually get to the bottom instead of being hung up in weeds.  Fourth thing I noticed and this happened pretty much at the same time as the increased weed growth was a huge increase in dink perch. They became a big nuisance. I would suspect the huge number of perch has to have an impact on the walleye in terms of competition and predation.  These are my observation's and I believe these things all combined are a big part of the problem. Others have talked about loss of spawning habitat and poor recruitment. Not being a biologist I can't form an opinion about these issues. But I have seen how much Trent Severn has messed up the spring water level fluctuations so I'm sure there is very good and justified reasons for concern.  Through all this the walleye have suffered to the point that the decision was made to close the winter season. A decision I agree with and support. A decision that should have been made 20 years ago IMHO. Is it too little to late? I think so...but boy do I hope I'm wrong."
947064,moxie,2015-11-30 14:30:00,1566,"All the possible factors  outlined may be contributors but the obvious is the most likely suspect. One river and shoreline to spawn on. Allow extreme water level fluctuation and you limit the already limited spawning habitat in a what is basically a swamp. Lived in Durham region for the better part of 3 decades and although i havent put tonnes of time in on that lake, i have fished it. Efforts geared toward the lakes' overall health should be undertaken but any resources beyond that should not be used to bolster a species that shouldnt be there. Outside the box? Develop a strain of big, hearty Bass."

947068,jimmer,2015-11-30 15:24:00,2730,"It sounds obvious to me that the kawarthas need to be protected and managed better. This discussion has been going on for years and we still see slow changes. I remember doing spawning site enhancement on Pigeon in the 90's and it is still facing some walleye population issues. Some say they are rebounding; I have not seen this personally. I can say that they do congregate in the winter and large schools could be slaughtered quickly. I run into this when pan fishing in the winter. The health of the lake means different things to different people. Some feel that all the weeds should be removed to make the lake healthier, others see the importance of weeds in a lake. Sounds like most on here want to see improvements and care about the future of the fishery, it's the ones that aren't on here that couldn't give a damn other than filling their limits. Then they move on to the next lake when their success dwindles. Yes, the internet has had an impact."
947104,captpierre,2015-11-30 18:12:00,2521,Anybody know which slot rules have worked out better for the eye populations. Rules on Balsam or those on the rest of the Kawarthas. I understand it is an experiment by the MNR.

About 50% of Walleye that I catch are in that slot size ,  30% would be below the slot size and 20% would be above the slot size. How it is working I could not tell you, but I do know that I have caught more big Walleye in the past couple of years than I did before."
947119,Dutch01,2015-11-30 19:20:00,1431,"I have read that walleye in Balsam Lake mature later than in other Kawartha Lakes. Here's an excerpt from a thread on another board (source at bottom):  ""The surveys confirmed the suspected decline in walleye stocks and also established that female walleye on Balsam Lake mature much later than on other Kawartha Lakes. According to the data, female Balsam Lake walleye require 6-7 years to achieve a size sufficiently mature to spawn (36- 43 cm, or 14""-17""), compared to only 4-5 years on other lakes.  At the same time, creel surveys on Balsam revealed that the majority of fish harvested from Balsam Lake were less than 6 years old. This information suggested that >75% of the walleye harvested from Balsam had likely never spawned. This implicated harvest as a major factor in walleye declines, over say recruitment or habitat factors. Protecting these slow growing fish from harvest once they reach sexual maturity provides them the opportunity to spawn 4-5 times and produce future generations of walleye, before they would again reach a harvestable size.""  source: http://www.lakesimcoeoutdoors.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=14699  This is just what a guy says the mnr told him, and he doesn't provide a source, but it does sound plausible."
946868,dave524,2015-11-28 03:06:00,4508,Closing for a year or rotating an open season on a yearly basis would be a hit or miss deal. if walleye production is anything like Lake Erie they get a really good spawn and hatch every 3 or 4 years and it is that one age class that drives the fishery until the next good reproduction season.
946893,spooner_jr,2015-11-28 13:48:00,193,"I was talking to a CO on the lake last winter, he said their fish shocking surveys showed a  number of mature walleyes, but no small ones.  That would lead me to believe the problem is not over-fishing, but something else.  I've noticed a decline ever since they put all the weevils in the lake to control the weeds. It hasn't affected the hordes of small perch though."
946894,moxie,2015-11-28 14:20:00,1566,"A friend once mused this thought ona board and received a less than favourable reaction. Take the money slated for any walleye initiative and strengthen the already thriving bass fishery. Just looking at a chart alone, walleye doesn't jump out at me."

946907,Tomcat,2015-11-28 15:54:00,395,"Tomcat you may have misunderstood. Or maybe I did. But I take that statement to mean the impact of no walleye fishing on the business's In the township of scugog nothing to do with your license fees going to business's  I clicked on the reference (to the OFAH website page on Lake Scugog Walleye Closure) the original poster provided and inter alia read the following under the heading Let Us Bear in Mind:  ""There was no assessment of the potential socioeconomic impacts to the local community that would result from a closure of the Walleye fishery. This should have been considered by the MNRF when making this decision.""  Although an OFAH member since 2001, I  personally do not support MNRF wild life management decisions being based in any part on socioeconomic impacts. There never has been nor should there be any guarantees to those who opt to set up businesses close to a resource lake/territory. While perhaps an unpopular opinion, I don't even consider such businesses as stakeholders. For me, the MNRF should involve legitimate stakeholders for a lake such as fishermen, First Nations when appropriate, cottage owners and fish biologists. I may not have articulated my thoughts well enough in my first post in this thread.  Supposedly, Ontario spends 100% of hunting and fishing revenue on fish and wildlife management. The funds go into a fish and wildlife special purpose account, which invests more than $65 million a year in fish and wildlife management. I do not support any of these funds in the fish and wildlife special purpose account being spent to study socioeconomic impacts of wildlife management decisions."
946911,Dutch01,2015-11-28 17:05:00,1431,"I agree with this, well said."
946917,Sinker,2015-11-28 18:31:00,8692,"Ditto...  Stocking is not the answer. Scugog is a VERY productive lake, but if the eyes cant reproduce because of something we are doing, we need to fix it. Water levels at spawning season plays a big part in this. Usually, when the walleye spawn thereis still ice on the lakes, and the spring thaw hasnt fully happened yet. The fish spawn in high water, water rises, the trent guys open the locks, the water lowers, and eggs are left high and dry. Its a big problem in all the kawartha lakes. If the eyes can get good spawning conditions, they will reproduce well, but we need a few consecutive years of this before you really see it.  S."
946919,captpierre,2015-11-28 19:13:00,2521,Agreed. Last year was good on Pigeon anyway. Low winter levels and steady spring  levels.
946930,moxie,2015-11-28 20:12:00,1566,Just curious as to why we feel the need to fix everything? Would a different tact be so bad ? I tend agree the causes should be investigated but only with concerns other species could be affected by the same causes whatever they may be.  It doesn't take a scientist to conclude that extreme water fluctuations in a shallow body of water as scugog is would negatively impact Walleye populations so why not concentrate and enhance thriving species.  With consistent cutbacks a return to the contrary is doubtful. It makes more sense to find a way over or around the wall instead of suffering a bloody forehead from continually banging into it. But then again what do I know.
946936,mukluk,2015-11-28 22:32:00,196,Maybe the Ministry of the Environment should get involved regarding water quality etc. on Lake Scugog.  All these beautiful manicured lawns that lead right to the waters edge have been virtually bombarded with fertilizer. Even seagulls have no problem walking on top of the weeds from one side of the lake to the other with all that weed growth in August.   Weeds use oxygen in large amounts and give off toxins.  Then there's the  leaching septic tanks that lead downhill to the lake.  Perhaps a (STC) is in order. A septic tank certificate whereby septic tanks would have to be inspected say every 10 years for problems and receive a passing grade.  Runoff leads to weed growth and pollution.  Water fluctuations as mentioned plus proper spawning areas are a big plus as well.  Look how well the herring numbers have excelled in Lake Simcoe since the water quality was improved.
946939,big guy,2015-11-28 23:04:00,414,"Something tells me there will still be many walleye caught AND taken home after the new rules go into place. Enforcement is an issue everywhere and without it, closing the fishery will have little effect."

946736,bigugli,2015-11-27 16:41:00,6138,Walleye populations have been struggling for some time. No surprise that they are now resorting to drastic measures until they figure out what to do.
946737,Acountdeleted,2015-11-27 16:43:00,2562,I think it was a year in the making. If I remember correctly a lot of people on this forum were asking for Scugog to close last year around this time.  Still lots of Crappie to target on the 'Gog.  Also weren't people on this forum reccomending Rice get opened up for winter? (I wouldn't know. I have no success there).
946738,Lunkerhunter,2015-11-27 16:45:00,455,I live on lake scugog and support this initiative by the MNRF. I think it is a great idea.  many other species in the lake are thriving and this will alleviate a ton of pressure during the hard water season.  I just hope the MNRF spend the necessary time and resources on repairing spawning habitats and other known factors that are causing the decline.
946739,Sinker,2015-11-27 16:49:00,8692,"About time. I don't think fishing has  lot to do with the decline in walleye, but shutting it down isn't going to hurt. We need recruitment to bring them back, I hope they focus on that.  It would be nice if we had one lake in the kawartha's to ice fish walleyes though. A rotating season from lake to lake would be awesome for a winter fishery here.  S."
946748,captpierre,2015-11-27 17:34:00,2521,Good. And provide enforcement.
946749,GBW,2015-11-27 17:43:00,8460,We all knew it was coming. There was other posts about it in the past. I hope it rebounds quick too as the only time I fish there is in the winter. Walleye was a treat; crappie and perch was the target for me.
946754,porkpie,2015-11-27 18:44:00,2521,"Don't know why they always wait until the last minute.  There could have been action taken on this sooner.  Better late than never I guess.  I like the idea of a revolving season, that'd make for a different experience from year to year."
946759,Sinker,2015-11-27 19:12:00,8692,MNR=Ministry of NO RESULTS  Always too little too late. Its sad.  S.
946765,esoxansteel,2015-11-27 19:28:00,1307,"As Shane said recruitment is key, and recruitment on Scugog is next to nil based on MNR survey nettings, and creel census, your NOT likely to see a big difference unless recruitment appears, on the other hand and this might be the smoking gun, if the Crappie havnt reached there peak yet on Scugog, and started their decline which is natures way of finding balance, you could see this fishery bounce back, although not too the glory years it once had. That's if Black Crappie are directly responsible for walleye recruitment, which IMO is the case"
946779,OhioFisherman,2015-11-27 20:33:00,6623,Didn't they just stop netting them on Nip? Kind of hard to try and protect populations on one lake and not another? Mutual sacrifice?
946782,jimmer,2015-11-27 20:41:00,2730,"I don't think it would be a good idea to open any kawartha lake for walleye in the winter. I don't believe they can take the pressure. I'm also concerned that some will continue to harvest walleye from Scugog, they do it on the other kawartha lakes even though they aren't open.  I think that the crappie have peaked on scugog, so I hope this closure shows some results in the next few years. If it doesn't, who knows what the problem is. I know as anglers we don't like to hear it has to do with harvesting, but from what I saw from some ice anglers, they definitely had an impact on the population. Especially the night anglers. This is from a frustrated kawartha angler so it's just my opinion."
946784,wormdunker,2015-11-27 20:44:00,1711,"We fished Scugog a lot in the mid 80s, was always a treat to bring in 3-4 walleye in the 3 lb range.  Sad to see it come to this."
946789,Sinker,2015-11-27 21:05:00,8692,"I would love to have a rotating season on walleye. There are lakes that could sustain the pressure for one year, then none the next.  The biggest problem with the kawartha's and walleye recruitment is water levels at spawning time. That's a whole different story that needs to be addressed with the Trent severn waterway. Those guys have messed up a few times real bad.  S."

Good for MNR (finally)  As for the rotating season, I think that is probably one of the best ideas I have ever heard and I would support that 100%. Now if I could only figure out where to catch crappie through the ice on Sturgeon Lake..... well I do know but I can't get there LOL."
946798,misfish,2015-11-27 21:28:00,29133,"I posted this on another site. Be interesting to see the comments and different opinions on it.  ""Why not just close the whole lake to all fishing for a year   Or at the least, close it to winter fishing. It,s not like it,s the only lake around for hard water angling. Any thoughts on how a introduction of walleye from the BOQ would do there? Would they adapt and produce?  """
946805,Tomcat,2015-11-27 21:55:00,395,Disappointing to read that the OFAH believes that the MNRF should have considered socioeconomic impacts before making such a decision. I don't support any of my licence fees going to support businesses along the lake.
946822,Lunkerhunter,2015-11-27 23:06:00,455,Hey brian. Why close the whole lake for a year when other species are thriving.  Also the economic impact on the business's would be way to significant if no fishing at all  as a resident of port Perry I would be devastated if I couldn't fish on my home lake  and did i mention almost most other species are thriving ?  Enforcement will be key. As jimmer mentioned many will probably still harvest walleye even when it's closed.
946823,Lunkerhunter,2015-11-27 23:09:00,455,Tomcat you may have misunderstood. Or maybe I did. But I take that statement to mean the impact of no walleye fishing on the business's In the township of scugog nothing to do with your license fees going to business's

Enforcement will be key. As jimmer mentioned many will probably still harvest walleye even when it's closed.   Your last comment makes me say this. I am talking outside the box here.  I have said way back, close rivers one year at a time. It,s makes it easy to inforce poachers then. You see an angler on a closed river or lake,theres no way to get out of a charge. Well Im sure they will try to think of one.  We all wish we had the right answer.  Like I said, thinking outside the box and JMO."
946833,chris.brock,2015-11-27 23:53:00,4053,"What is recruitment?  I think most guys (me too) use the term to mean spawning success.

I don't know what strain they initially stocked in there but I don't think stocking BOQ fish will solve this.  I like the idea of a rotating Kawartha lake walleye ice fishing season. It would take some of the pressure off the Haliburton lakers too."

946837,Dutch01,2015-11-28 00:37:00,1431,"I lived in Port Perry from 2003-2009.  My Son was born in 2003, and when he was a baby he would go to bed at 7:30pm, and Wifey would try to sleep when he did.  So I  used to take my boat out several nights a week for a few hours.  I used to catch literally dozens of small walleye every night.  So my point is that it wasn't that long ago that the fishery seemed to be in good shape from my limited perspective. I'm surprised it has fallen so far, so fast.  I sure hope this helps this lake to recover.  I don't live there or fish there anymore, but I still would like to see the fishery bounce back."
