958533,Garfisher,2016-02-20 02:15:00,229,That would be correct.
958536,GBW,2016-02-20 02:51:00,8460,"That would be correct. Yeah, the person whom sent me the PDF today did say (just now via text) that you can fish the rivers for walleye in the summer on the other sides of said boundaries.  And he's been working with the MNR on this for the past 3 straight years."
958580,big guy,2016-02-20 15:17:00,414,Why the hell wouldn't they close the Nonquon as well?
958582,Sinker,2016-02-20 15:29:00,8692,"Yeah, doesn't make any sense to me at all. Whats the point of closing the lake if you can fish them in the rivers where they spawn? Typical MNR Bull. Such a joke.  S."
958593,GBW,2016-02-20 16:53:00,8460,"no clue folks, just passing on what was sent to me.  but the rivers are closed last I looked during the spawning season."

Are you able to cite a source or provide a reference to an official copy of these boundaries? An attachment to a posting on a fishing forum, while appreciated and useful, isn't going to be considered a supporting legal document although I am not a lawyer."

An attachment to a posting on a fishing forum, while appreciated and useful, isn't going to be considered a supporting legal document although I am not a lawyer. The file was sent to me from a person on the board with the MRN.  He just got it yesterday and it should be on the site in a few days in the ""info on lake scugog"" area"
958602,GBW,2016-02-20 17:27:00,8460,"ps, read the very bottom of the file as it is from the MRN.  A bit of overkill for someone to spoof it one would think..."
958613,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-20 18:36:00,8243,I would think keeping the river open is a political compromise for those that pay property taxes in the area and are no longer allowed to fish the lake.  How long are these new regs. in effect?
958621,Garfisher,2016-02-20 19:20:00,229,"Up until the MNRF decides to reopen Scugog, so it'll be years before reopening may be considered."
958647,Dutch01,2016-02-20 22:06:00,1431," I do agree there room for trouble if you keep a fish from the river and are later checked by a CO.  If it were me, I would take a picture when I catch it (with the river in the background and EXIF GPS data enabled), just to be safe."
958661,FloatnFly,2016-02-21 00:57:00,1640,"As far as I know, you can't fish the rivers when they are spawning anyways. The season isn't open yet, and there are sanctuaries.  I do agree there room for trouble if you keep a fish from the river and are later checked by a CO.  If it were me, I would take a picture when I catch it (with the river in the background and EXIF GPS data enabled), just to be safe.   was going to say this as well, say you fish the river early morning for walleye, then move to lake for bass, and get checked in the lake?"
998040,MJIG,2017-03-26 13:49:00,227,"The 2017 regulations are more explicit on what areas are included in the ""Closed All Year"" walleye closure. The regulations now state ""Lake Scugog, including waters south of Highway 7A, Blackstock Creek, Nonquon River; as well as the Scugog River to the Trent Severn Dam in Lindsay, Mariposa Brook and East Cross Creek.""
