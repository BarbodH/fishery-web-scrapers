A younger person would be preferred because of the physical side of the job (someone in their 20s would probably be ideal)  You would be paired up with experienced flatbed drivers and would be team driving at least until you have enough experience to handle it on your own. There could/would be overnight runs involved so if you have to be home every night this isn't for you.  The company has been in business for 30 years, it's a family owned and run like a family business, they treat their staff very well and don't have much turnover. All of their equipment is maintained to VERY high standards, you won't be driving some old beat up rust bucket.  If you are interested please PM me.  "
