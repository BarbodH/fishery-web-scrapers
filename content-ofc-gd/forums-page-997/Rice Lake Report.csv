227307,mistyriver1,2008-07-14 03:23:00,600,The family and I spent last week up at a resort on Rice Lake.  The fishing was excellent.    I'll let Mistyjr post his own pics as he had a pretty darn good week as well.   Here's some pics.....            I limited out in Walleye one morning with one 20 incher and three between 16 to 18 inches.  My partner for the morning caught two as well.        Saw tons of dead carp...hit a couple by accident as well.    A couple of Ben in action....   Double header...micro tube and worm...   I ended up with 15 Bass for the week..all between 14 to 16 inches.  All were released.    The Lew Catfish   ...   The mid-week fish fry....   Our dog enjoying the boat...   Nice shot by my wife...   The family shot
