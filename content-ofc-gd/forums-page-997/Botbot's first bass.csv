227146,splashhopper,2008-07-13 21:40:00,2931,"Well I finally got a chance to take my daughter,Botbot, fishing for smallmouth bass today. It was windy as heck out and we were trying to float fish,but was difficulty working that method out with her.  So, I decided to introduce her to bottom bouncing.  She got really excited when she felt the first BUMP on the line.   She didn't give the pole a tug as she was sooo excited to feeel that fish. lol  We reeled it in to check the bait and then i cast it back out for her.  THIS time she is REEEEAAAAAADY! ... nothing.. for a minute or two and she says her arm is getting sore holding the pole..lol  As she turns to look at where the noise behind her came from, she gets a hit! And this time she tugs it.  FISH ON DADDY!  About a one lb smallie.. (nice eating size)  Two blue gills later and she is really getting to like the ""bottom bouncing now"". lol  And then, whammo,, FISH ON!  She is PUMPED. This fish was slightly smaller but waaay scrappier than the one earlier.  And here she is with her first bass >>   Then she says: ""Daddy, when can i go to the Maitland river to catch one like you did on Friday night""?   I say, FIVE more SLEEPS!  Good luck sleeping Botbot.  Splashhopper and Botbot  PS. Botbot = ""pretty little girl"" in Tagalo(Filipino)"

227268,splashhopper,2008-07-14 01:37:00,2931," yep, she has ""the bug"".  I am taking her up to the Maitland river next weekend for our first ever daddy and botbot ONLY weekend away together.  If the weather holds, we will be walking the river to 4-5 holes I know of and have some kind of a shore lunch. (even if it is the ""surprise"" hotdogs I will be sure to pack. lol)  She already has her camera ready and is telling her friends about it.  Let's hope the weather holds for her.  Splashhopper"
