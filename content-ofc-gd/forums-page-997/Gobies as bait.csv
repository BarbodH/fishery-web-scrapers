226859,Greencoachdog,2008-07-12 23:35:00,8163,Gobie imitation baits are pretty hot from what I've heard aboot them.

226864,Fisherman,2008-07-12 23:44:00,7201,"NOT allowed, dead or alive."
226867,forrest,2008-07-12 23:49:00,1032,legal as bird and worm bait only
226870,danbo,2008-07-12 23:52:00,2646,"Sorry, I am not implying or condoning their use, but an ""artificial"" one should work great. I personally thought nothing would eat the little invaders!  Here's some..   http://www.lunkerhunt.com/productDetails.cfm?prodID=LHPGG4"
226871,modny,2008-07-12 23:53:00,502,"i used to catch tonnes of gobies off the maitland pier, throw em in a bucket, then splash the bucket all over the pier and watch the segull fest begin.  all the gobies get eaten in like 2 seconds"
226872,Domi Fish,2008-07-13 00:03:00,46,There's nothing wrong with using gobies for bait.  It's only illegal if you get caught.
226882,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 00:37:00,8163,"In the article Danbo posted:  It states that the Gobies force out native species like the Sculpin and Darter and removes them an important species) from the food chain. It doesn't mention that the Gobie replaces them in the food chain (which they do).  The aforementioned article also states the nuisance of the Zebra Mussel. It doesn't mention the new jobs created for removing the mussel, nor that the Zebra Mussel has cleaned up a tremendous amount of pollution in the Great Lakes, the Great Lakes are cleaner than they have been in years!  ... but here's a really interesting twist to the whole thing!  Zebra Mussels can comprise up to 82% of the Gobies diet!!!  I found that tid bit of info in this interesting article:  http://www.glwi.uwm.edu/people/jjanssen/pa.../mandypaper.pdf  I don't condone the introduction or spread of invasive species... but Mother Nature has a way of taking care of herself, and it might be interesting to see how this unfolds in the years to come."
226894,Rich,2008-07-13 00:54:00,3927,"Unfortunately, zebra mussels are like little water filters. Meaning they ingest all of the toxins. So when the gobies eat the mussels, they are now full of toxins. Now what about when the bass, walleye, catfish, perch, pike, and just about everything else that swims eats the gobies?  Food chain right?"
226898,mbac31,2008-07-13 00:58:00,904,"Everything will evolve eventually like everything else does. Some of the weed species we have here in the beginning we were all in a panic that they would ruin watersheds but now it is just a normal part of our lakes to our benefit. Lake Simcoe locals said the lake would be  ruined by the invasion of the Zebra mussels, result. Massive Smallies now, walleye are there but they have moved. You need to adapt. Most of the smaller lakes like Scugog have some areas that have clear water now from them that harbour very large Smallmouth. Things will reach an extreme before it gets better. Gobies will reach their max and become a natural part of their food chain."
226900,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 01:04:00,8163," Adapt, improvise, and overcome!!!"
226901,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 01:06:00,8163,"  Yeah, just imagine how great a fishery the Great Lakes would be if they were C&R!  ... it isn't like y'all don't have other places to catch fish to eat eh?"
226934,setomonkey,2008-07-13 02:26:00,872,A buddy of mine swears by goby-coloured tubes on the great lakes.  Mike
226942,Rich,2008-07-13 03:10:00,3927, You must mean all the other lakes and rivers in the area the gobies & zebra mussels have moved their way into.
226985,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 12:25:00,8163,"  No... actually I meant the other lakes, rivers, and streams that don't have Gobies and Zebra Mussels that are even more polluted than the Great Lakes!"
226990,Billy Bob,2008-07-13 12:36:00,5865, Catch an Release will never work in the Great Lake until the Canadian gill netter's are stopped
226993,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 12:39:00,8163, Maybe they should gill net the Gobies?
226998,Billy Bob,2008-07-13 12:55:00,5865,Since the gobies are mostly belly to the bottom I don't think gill netting would be productive. It would just harm even more sport fish like the smallmouth bass.
227004,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 13:10:00,8163,Want to catch Smallies in the Great Lakes???  Read this: http://proxy.espn.go.com/outdoors/bassmast...ea_Goby_BMM0607
227051,Zubris21,2008-07-13 16:18:00,563,"When I lived in Windsor I went to a local tackle shop, and they swore by imitation Gobys.  He said most boats jigging the detroit river were using imitation gobys, and the best colours were the bright ones."
227090,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 18:53:00,8163,  It turns out that the Gobies are sucking them down like a fat Redneck at an all you can eat 'Possum buffet!  http://www.glwi.uwm.edu/people/jjanssen/pa.../mandypaper.pdf
227096,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 19:31:00,8163,"  Well heck!!! It worked last night!  A quick Google search of ""Gobies eat Zebra Mussels"" produced this though:  Contaminants Transfer: On the positive side, round gobies eat large quantities of zebra mussels, another invader that is causing an increasingly large number of problems because of its huge reproductive output. As filter feeders, Zebra mussels, consume toxins that are found throughout the Great Lakes. Zebra mussels are an important component of the gobies' diet in their native range; and, in laboratory studies in North America, a single round goby can eat up to 78 zebra mussels a day. However, it is unlikely that gobies alone will have a detectable impact on zebra mussels. The round goby is expected to be one of several species (including ducks, crayfish, diseases, and other fish species) that eventually will reduce the abundance of zebra mussels. The concern about this fact is that Gobies are preyed upon by several sportfish species (e.g., smallmouth and rock bass, walleyes, yellow perch, and brown trout). Because the diet of round gobies consists predominately of zebra mussels, there may be a direct transfer of contaminants from gobies to sport fish, which could increase the health concerns about eating fish"
227118,Billy Bob,2008-07-13 20:27:00,5865,Gobies and sheephead couldn't put a dent in the zebra population. Once you have seen the MASSIVE amounts of zebra mussels first hand you will understand. EVERYTHING that the mussels can cling to has MULTIPLE LAYERS  of zebra mussels. They are here to stay as are the gobies
227287,1Harringtona,2008-07-14 02:03:00,77,I personally hate those little waste of time fish
