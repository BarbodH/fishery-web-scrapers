226462,Billy - Curtiss,2008-07-11 21:56:00,241,"I took a buddy of mine with whom I play music out to the Toronto Islands yesterday morning to try our hands at landing pike and bass. It was an incredibly nice morning and we caught the ferry and were casting by 6:45 AM. We pretty much fished every single place possible for hours with nary a bite. Then we discovered a nice little bass stronghold and while we garnered several follows and some bites, we weren't able to land one. Eventually, we made our way to one of Highdrifter's fabled honey holes that I became privy to after plying him with booze, a side of pig and 3 heads of cattle. It is also Highdrifter's personal belief that Happy Hour for pike is right in and around 11:00 AM. This day was no exception. We rolled into said honey hole right at 11:00 AM on the dot and I got a hit on my first cast. This beauty breached shooting straight up and out of the lake before heading back down and diving as far down into the slop as possible. I was using 10 lb Crystal Fireline and intitally, the thing wouldn't even budge an inch. I was convinced I was going to snap the line. So I waded out waste deep into the pristine waters (I still smell funky!) and moved further down shore to try pulling it out from a different angle. This was the trick apparently. With a little more effort this bad boy came thrashing into shore.    My buddy got some great video footage of the catch and subsequent release. I have no idea what the weight was but it measured in at 34 inches. After that, we didn't even bother fishing anymore. We made straight for the Cafe for pints and burgers to revel in the excitement! So now I know they're really there. And all that remains to be done is for me to land something 40 inches or more. My weekly forays to the island just keep getting better and better!"
226472,ccmtcanada,2008-07-11 22:12:00,7971,WOW!! Great job!!  More inches for the team  Congrats on a PB....that's a nice chunky pike you got there....I'd say it's around 12 pounds.
226482,highdrifter,2008-07-11 22:31:00,2534,"NOICE!  I'm so happy for you.. my scentless apprentice!  However, I need not remind you that I'm still waiting those 3 heads of cattle you promissed me.  I expect to be paid in full tomorrow, or you'll have to down 3 angus.... on our way to the Forks of the Credit!!  Right on brotha.  HD"
226523,Moosebunk,2008-07-11 23:31:00,3970,CONGRATS.  Great looking fish
226531,mepps,2008-07-11 23:40:00,1301,Nice catch!!  Get some heavier line for next trip
226540,Greencoachdog,2008-07-12 00:02:00,8163,"Great report and uh...er.. pic!!!!  That is one heckuva eel sox there, dammit man!!!... I love the Pike porn!!!  2 fishing tips for ya... 1. Wear a ball cap... it'll keep the sun out of your eyes, and how are you going to catch much without your lucky hat? 2. Get a tan... it'll help camoflage you into the background  you must look like a white beacon standing on shore to the fish, but the tattoo's prolly help break it up a little  I wonder how many Largemouth Bass that fish had rid the planet of?"
226541,tbayboy,2008-07-12 00:02:00,1497,Nice fish.  ANd people were saying the islands weren't producing this year.  Just gotta be willing to get stinky I guess.
226545,mattyk,2008-07-12 00:08:00,2110,very nice looking fish!

226612,bassassin,2008-07-12 02:37:00,152,"if thats Mr. Orbison on your stomach, than hats of to you paying tribute to a Master!!"
226631,ehg,2008-07-12 03:47:00,2666,"That's a healthy, clean pike there. Not a mark on it, still has perfect fins, etc... Not bad for being caught within the shadow of metropolis.(Toronto) Great fish and report, ehg"
226703,oxcowboy,2008-07-12 14:12:00,544,"man your killing me, we always buzz around toronto as fast as we can so we can drive another 6 hours to get north where the big boys swim.  in the last 16 years ive only caught 1 that might be better than yours.  congrats on a real nice fish.   jason"
226908,white007,2008-07-13 01:34:00,16,"Hey great catch on the huge pike, i have been down there with my brother the last three weeks in a row and have only come up with foul hooking a couple of shad lol, i had one follow by a pike first week into pike opener but that was about it. The last couple of weeks have been hard to fish with all of the pollen from trees floating on top of the water, has the pollen pasts. I try to fish hard from halens point to the centre island fairy but no luck so far. Hopefully i will have one soon."
226910,setomonkey,2008-07-13 01:43:00,872,"Nice pike, glad to see the Islands can still produce...  Mike"
226926,PatrickGG,2008-07-13 02:13:00,562,"Awesome Fish, Congrats."
227286,snag,2008-07-14 02:03:00,1932,You're the man Billy!  Fidel tells me you used chloroform to ply him. Usually he does it for a candy bar and a wink.  Great catch!
