227136,BIG JIM,2008-07-13 21:19:00,11,"Hey Guys, just wanted to take a few moments to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for the auction with Marc, and all the kind things that were said about me by a lot of anglers... it really has helped me along the way here.  I have always been the guy who carried the fridge or pushed the stuck car, it is just what I am and I nerver realized how many people I had touched in my life because of fishing.  Today isn't the best day, but as I have told many people I have a head like a cement block and don't intend to waiver to much throughout this event.  My Dr's have told me never to lose my attitude and that it is among the best they have ever witnessed in their careers... I just have to keep the arrow on top of my coconut pointing forward.   Thank-you again...right from the bottom of my heart...BIG TIME...  Warmest Regards  BIG JIM"

227145,outllaw,2008-07-13 21:38:00,1232,when one gives in the community for decades. one should receive when a little push is needed. your that guy jim. best to you from southern ontario.
227151,JohnF,2008-07-13 21:54:00,3494," Jim,  I don't know you because I haven't been around fishing too long, but judging by the reaction from these guys to the news of your personal setback I'd say you must be a helluva guy. In fact, I mentioned the reaction in my local fishing store and the immediate response from the owner was ""What's the website? I want to buy some tickets."" He said you're a great guy too. In my sixty some odd years whenever I've had that kind of consistent feedback on someone it's always meant they really were a good person, so I want to offer you my best wishes and hopes for a ""great"" outcome for a ""great"" guy. Sounds like you deserve at least that much.  As for the attitude stuff - my wife was given a rather nasty diagnosis, and a scary prognosis. She kept a great attitude throughout all the treatments, even the setbacks (chemo didn't work first try), but in the end she's riding high. We knew it was all good the day her oncologist walked into the room with the greeting ""I'm thrilled."". She (the oncologist) said all along that a positive attitude was so important, not only for making it through the down times, but also for coming out on top of this damned disease. Keep smiling, Jim. In these early days it'll be hard sometimes, but if you smile enough you're bound to be smiling for a long long time.  Keep the faith dude, All the best from me and my wife JF"

227638,Handlebarz,2008-07-14 22:40:00,3790,Big Jim you have done so much and it shows how much the fishing comunity stands behind you if selling some of the Muskies Canada tickets is what it takes then that is not to much to ask and for everyone else it is a great thing to get involved with for $5 you have a great chance at some amazing prizes. PM me if you need tickets.  All our best Jim from here in Chatham Mike
