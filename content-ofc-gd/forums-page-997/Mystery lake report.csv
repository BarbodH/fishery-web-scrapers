227591,misfish,2008-07-14 20:16:00,29133,"Wish I had known him many years ago,when ""he"" was younger.LOL"
226789,misfish,2008-07-12 21:04:00,29133,"Not sure on what to expect after a 2 hour drive and a 1 hour portage.I carried the boat and terry carried the rods  Terry and I never seen so many great spots and so many buckets. We were starting to get wore out from all the action. They were not big guys,but man did they ever fight. I could not believe it. A 2 pound bucket fought harder then a 4 pound smallie. These fish were on the small side,but very chunky. Didnt take long to figure out the bait of choice. A black 6 inch worm weightless. Even had some fun with the scum frog. What a blast. Sorry Im not much into writting a report today as I have a brutal head cold and my mind is not there. I,ll just say,I cant wait to hit this place again. UNREAL. Hope you dont catch what I had today Terry.  Hope I can get through Sundays tourney.              Sorry again for the lack of    report."
226792,Spiel,2008-07-12 21:06:00,9065,....I'm still hurt'n from last week when I portaged my boat into that lake.
226795,Greencoachdog,2008-07-12 21:09:00,8163,Nice report and pics!!!  I wonder what they'd have done to a Buzzbait?
226796,misfish,2008-07-12 21:10:00,29133, Did you slip in bear poop too Chris.
226798,misfish,2008-07-12 21:12:00,29133," Funny you ask that. There was one lying on the consol and as we were heading back to the launch,I said the same thing."
226800,Spiel,2008-07-12 21:14:00,9065," ....Oh yeah, kids, dog and GF still won't come near me.  Good job on those bass though, love the dark coloration in those stained weedy lakes."
226801,SlowPoke,2008-07-12 21:20:00,2984,I usually leave the kicker motor at home for a one hour portage. Looks like Terry guided you into some nice action -Brian
226805,Terry,2008-07-12 21:28:00,14456,"first time for me putting a boat in that lake.....a ton of bass,  lots of action and 1200254 deer flies...that bite and dive bombs your head...  I had a great time, but I sure feel burnt out"
226807,medmart,2008-07-12 21:32:00,587,Nice report bro.That place looks great nice day to be out  Rob
226810,misfish,2008-07-12 21:37:00,29133, Wheres your salmon report Bro?
226816,misfish,2008-07-12 21:58:00,29133, Which none ever touched me. Guess the scent of the bear poop helpped.LOL  Glad you had a great time bud.  Lets see what the next lake brings us.
226824,mattyk,2008-07-12 22:06:00,2110,some nice fish guys!
227161,blowes,2008-07-13 22:20:00,16,his salmon report is still in the fog lol lol
227211,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-14 00:21:00,0,"Great report Brian. Looks like some juicy slop! I love non stop action once and awhile. Even when its only the little guys!  Oh and ""A 2 pound bucket fought harder then a 4 pound smallie""....  Don't you think your exagerating just a little wee bit?LOL"
227212,misfish,2008-07-14 00:24:00,29133, Just ask Terry.
227228,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-14 00:52:00,0, I guess sometimes its a real challenge getting them out of the slop! Especially when they come with 4 lbs of slop attached to them.lol  Looks like you guys make a good team!
227231,Terry,2008-07-14 00:57:00,14456,they really did fight hard and we really thought some 2lb Largemouths  were big smallmouths because of how hard they fought  I think it's something in the water up there  and we do have fun out there
227303,mistyriver1,2008-07-14 03:14:00,600,"Great report Brian, congrats to you and Terry."
227348,steve_paul,2008-07-14 10:48:00,658,"Great report Brian, good job guys.  Hope the head cold is feeling better and the poop smell is gone.  Thanks for the report."
227358,Victor,2008-07-14 11:10:00,1609,Great pics and report brian! looks like the perfect structure & weather to fish!
227363,Roy,2008-07-14 11:19:00,13728,"WTG guys. Judging by the size of that boat, I would have had to make 4 trips in. Thanks for posting....looks like a blast!"
227365,Moosebunk,2008-07-14 11:22:00,3970,Always nice toaking a one hour stumble into an honey hole.
227458,RHYBAK,2008-07-14 14:22:00,21,"Hey Misfish. It must have been one short Portage to carry that big boat along with the main engine,a kicker and a bow mount.  Way to go. Congratulations."
227478,johnnyb,2008-07-14 15:11:00,3413,"No question that those back-lake largies fight harder -- I go to a similar mystery lake, and the largies in there are feistier than anywhere else I've been.  Nicely done, guys!"
227583,solopaddler,2008-07-14 20:09:00,8605,"Well done boys, nice fish!"
