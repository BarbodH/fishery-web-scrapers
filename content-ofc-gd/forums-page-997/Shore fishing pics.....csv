The carp seem to be in full spawn, so we decided to see what else was swimming around....here's a few pics of what we've managed....  Bly's Sheepie...caught using a small inline spinnerbait.   Here's a rogue bass I caught....using live leeches and floating at a depth of about 6 feet.   One night we used simple worm/hook/float and managed a few fair sized bullhead.     Sometimes, just getting back to basics can yield some results!"

227362,Victor,2008-07-14 11:16:00,1609,A nice mixed bag of fish Cliff and Carole! It's always great to tie into a fish on the other end of the line after a long day of work regardless of what it is. Too bad i dont' live as close to the water as you do.  Carole: Is your hand alright?
227460,ccmtcanada,2008-07-14 14:26:00,7971, It'll be fine Victor....she had a tendon pop out...so it's very sore and flares up easily.  Just gotta keep it immobile for a while then it'll be good as new!
