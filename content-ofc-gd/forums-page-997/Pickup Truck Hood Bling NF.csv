227243,JeffBornFishin,2008-07-14 01:15:00,260,OK saw this today parked on the causeway in Bridgenorth...GIT R DONE! HAHAHA!      How's that for safe and legal on our roadways?
227251,Roy,2008-07-14 01:22:00,13728,Maybe his wife threw him out and she tied his belongings to the front of the truck eh?
227252,Daplumma,2008-07-14 01:22:00,1961,I'm not so happy about this stuff.Total lack of respect for the animal.Prolly shot it out of the window of his truck.No wonder us hunters are under fire from the anti hunters.I know it is his right to display his horns but it doesn't do us any favors. Joe
227254,Greencoachdog,2008-07-14 01:24:00,8163,I might be impressed if it was a Marlin...
227255,Roy,2008-07-14 01:25:00,13728,I hear ya Joe.
227262,Daplumma,2008-07-14 01:33:00,1961,Specially if he had hooked him right in the f-in' eye!Love ya Dawg.. Joe

Obviously, it was done with a fresh kill in my town, not an old mounted animal.  This might be appropriate after some marriages too."
227283,JeffBornFishin,2008-07-14 02:00:00,260,Wonder if this something last minute...yellow poly rope holding it on.  Maybe lost a bet?  Was part of the Top Bass Tourney.
227293,Mattones,2008-07-14 02:22:00,587,im surprised no one took it:P
