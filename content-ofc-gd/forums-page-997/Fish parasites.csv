227240,Greencoachdog,2008-07-14 01:14:00,8163,They all sound sickening to me!
227256,Rich,2008-07-14 01:25:00,3927,"Both are safe to consume, according to the MNR.  The black ones are called ""sea lice"" and rarely go past the scales and skin. Therefore, skin your fish and you're fine. I've been eating fish with them for years and have yet to see any damageamageamageamage!  Finkle 5. Finkle 5. Shine shoe."
227266,Skud,2008-07-14 01:36:00,739,LOL Rich.  These Smallies from Doe Lake had both parasites and the black Sea Lice were loaded all through the meat. The yellow grubs were few(6-8 per fish)
