226776,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-12 20:07:00,1362,"The day started with meeting my buddy Mike at 4:30AM today at our usual meeting area West of Ottawa ....continued back on the highway and got to the lake, and boat in the water before sunrise...    Gorgeous morning it was and no other boats or people to be seen except for this loon....awesome!!!    Soon as we got out to our starting point we missed 2 Lakers within a few minutes of getting our lines out...they were hittin' very lightly!!  The sun started to rise and the fog slowly started to lift...    By 6:30, I had the first one in the boat...not too big, but definitely a keeper for dinner tonight  ....It's unbelievable how hard these Lakers fight and the head shakes are constant right up to the boat...    Mike was next with this 7lb 3oz fatty...ended up bein biggest of the day...GOOD ONE MIKE!!  quick pic and back into the water as this one was a non-stocked Laker...    Here's another one that Mike got before 9:30.....then it was shutdown period until we got off the lake at 11:30AM...Had another great outing with a good buddy and can hardly wait until next weekend's trout adventure!!....    Steve"
