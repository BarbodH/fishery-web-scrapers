I was wondering if anyone knew where i could get discount coupons or have any they would like to give away.  Thanks guys and gals!  Denis"
227312,danbo,2008-07-14 03:34:00,2646,You could hop the fence behind the Grizzly Pen..
227332,Tarzan's Jane,2008-07-14 07:49:00,1183,"Try CAA.  I'm guessing, but they often have things like this.  Shopper's Drug Mart use to have discounts for Wonderland and I know that Jean Coutu has discounts for La Ronde.  Also....you may want to try a place called Hemmingford Zoo (Parc Safari)....not too far from Montreal.  Was there a few years back...excellent place.  They have the drive through zoo thingy...bring carrots...and a great water park and rides.  Everything is free with your admission into the park.  We packed a picnic (cut down on the cost) and spent the entire day there.  I recall one water activity where it cost $1.00 each time to go down this stream on a tube.  Here's their site:   www.parcsafari.com  (first time inserting a link   and it doesn't work and no time to research  )  (they have a $20.00 coupon and kids under 2 are free)  Regardless....I'm sure the kids will have a great time no matter where you bring them....they are with you!!!"
227392,Tdel,2008-07-14 11:57:00,393,CAA does have discounts for various attractions including the Toronto Zoo.  There is a discount of 10% but you have to be a member.  Twilight here is the link you were trying to show. ParcSafari  Tom
227445,bullybass,2008-07-14 14:00:00,144,I don't know of any discount coupons but I can share a tip about the zoo with you. wear clothes of a light khaki... pants and shirt if you have them or khaki pants or shorts and a hunter green top or coat. this is what the keepers wear and the animals will actually respond to you thinking you are a keeper... I used to play with the siberian tigers alot this way.... jumping out from behind a tree... they would jump up on the fence in turn.... much better experience...
227454,ketchenany,2008-07-14 14:11:00,3229,"Tinman, get youself a Attraction Ontario Passport, they are available by calling1 800 ONTARIO, or on the net at www.ontariotravel. for attractionsnet there are lots of discount coupons in it.

227518,Kirk,2008-07-14 17:38:00,347,I get mine for 'free' : airmiles...you only redeem 85 miles / free pass to the zoo
227528,ketchenany,2008-07-14 18:09:00,3229,Oops gave you the wrong website  www.attractionsontario.ca   or   www.ontariotravel.net/family
227696,caper,2008-07-15 01:04:00,210,Couldn't find any coupons for the zoo but if you were staying any length of time this sounds like a decent deal which includes a visit to the zoo.  http://www.citypass.com/city/toronto.html
227741,GBW,2008-07-15 02:45:00,8460,That's what we do too.
