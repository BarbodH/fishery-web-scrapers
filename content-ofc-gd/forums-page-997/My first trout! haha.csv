226761,Mattones,2008-07-12 18:54:00,587,Went fishing for a two hours with the girlfriend this morning and I landed 3 trout and she landed one with a few other a pan fish. Yesterday I went to Wal-mart and picked myself up a package of powerbait worms to use. Two thumbs up!   These were the two larger ones. 14 inchers  This was my first time catching and keeping a fish. Lastnight I watched some videos on youtube on how to cut and such. I did a great job

227261,Rich,2008-07-14 01:31:00,3927,Nice ones. Judging by the colors those are farm trout. I miss fishing the stocked ponds.
227386,Victor,2008-07-14 11:53:00,1609,Nice colors on the trout!
227393,ccmtcanada,2008-07-14 11:57:00,7971,Nice going!  Odd they didn't fight too much...even the smaller ones tend to have some spunk in them.  Hope they tasted great!
