227641,mistaredone,2008-07-14 22:44:00,913,Ill be up at kill bear provincial park on Wednesday and was looking to do some musky fishing on a lake other than G bay because I rent tineys.  Any suggestions?
227650,muskymike,2008-07-14 22:56:00,772,"If you are on GBay, FISH ON Gbay. I have never fished the Killbear/Sound area, but have boated it from Point Au Baril and from Port Severn. There are TONS of areas I would love to try out there.  If you can head north into the north end of Shawanaga, or the south end by Twin Sisters, they are 2 pretty good areas, but it would take a good 2 hours to get there by 14' tinny. I have done it a few times and it gets ROUGH.  Sorry I cant help you more.  GBaygiant and Jigger may be able to help. I know Jigger has fished Shawanaga, he may have headed south to the Sound"

227688,muskymike,2008-07-15 00:45:00,772,Looks like we gotta get out there soon Bill. I dont wanna hijack his thread tho hahah.  Any ideas where?
227729,mistaredone,2008-07-15 02:31:00,913,Any marina suggestions for rentals in the area?
227739,muskymike,2008-07-15 02:42:00,772,"Not sure of rentals, I know there is a Marina where the road splits in the ""Y"". Dont go down the Killbear way, the other way has one at the end. Havent been to it in ages tho."
