225452,ccmtcanada,2008-07-09 17:02:00,7971,SWEET report Will!  Looked like a bug-filled amazing time up there.  Congrats on the PB Pike too!  One of these days Bly and I will do a fly in somewhere...maybe for our 10th anniversary....  Thanks for putting the report together!
225489,tbayboy,2008-07-09 18:02:00,1497,Some really nice scenery pics there Will.  Sounds like a fun time too except maybe for the bugs
225493,Moosebunk,2008-07-09 18:09:00,3970,You'll find more than a few folks who believe 40 inch pike to be 20 pounders.... when the average is about 16.  It's not unheard of for a long skinny fish of 43 to be around the 16 mark either.  I wouldn't be put off with either number for your PB... 43 inches is a great fish no matter what.  You must have made it into Magiskan cause I'm pretty certain I recognize one of the photos as being the end of that lake where you'd come in.  Mikwam is a pretty great little corner of the Cochrane District.  Scenic.  Thanks for the report.  Ya see many sturgeon on the trip or no???
225494,modny,2008-07-09 18:10:00,502,like the pic of the arctic hare
225510,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-09 19:10:00,2585,awesome pics other then the snake pics.  ewwwwwwww  Lol great reports thanks for shairing
225520,Joey,2008-07-09 19:52:00,9122,"Some of those pictures are just amazing.  Can you see the rabbit  I ""borrowed"" one of the sunset pics.  Joey"
225726,ccmtcanada,2008-07-10 12:17:00,7971," Cool...fishing and a fencing tournament!! So, how does that work exactly?  Does each competitor stand in their own boat?  Or does one board the other.  Does the winner take the other persons boat and fish?  Details....we want details."
225778,fishnsled,2008-07-10 14:45:00,3520,"  Hey Moosebunk - Didn't see any Sturgeon on our trip this year.  I'm certainly not put off by the size of my pike at all, it was a sweet fish.    I don't get a chance to fish for northerns very often but the muskies I've caught around that size have been in the high teens low 20's.  We had a musky a few years ago that was 43"" and weighed in at 23.5 pounds.  Is there typically a big difference between northerns and muskies in weight for the same lenght?  Time of year certainly plays a big difference and that is why I chalked it up to a post spawn female.   For the first time I can see the rabbit!!  LOL!  Now that's an oldie.  No problem in ""borrowing"" the sunset either.    We are still working out the rules and such but are hoping to have it as an olympic event in 2012."
