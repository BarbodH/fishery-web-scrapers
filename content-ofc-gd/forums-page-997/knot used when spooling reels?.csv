227475,issamhay,2008-07-14 14:59:00,77,Is there any specific knot type i should use when i attach my line to my reel? Thanks in advance
227477,johnnyb,2008-07-14 15:04:00,3413,"It kind of depends on what line/reel you're using. I try to put a loop in the end of the line, then thread the spool of line through it before reeling.  This way it just pulls tight, should I ever get down to the bottom of the spool -- I've never actually been taken all the way down the the last loop though, just wishful thinking!    If I can't get it to work, I just tie a barrel knot. If you're using PowerPro (or other braidedm slippery lines, I'm assuming) you should put a piece of tape around the spool before you start, so that it grabs.  I use hockey tape and have never had a problem."
