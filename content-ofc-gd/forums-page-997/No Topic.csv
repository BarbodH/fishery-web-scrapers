225864,highdrifter,2008-07-10 17:43:00,2534,"Bien joue mon grand!  Des osti de beaux poissons, superbement photographies...  Dang, my alt keys won't work here..  You must have switched your keyboard settings...  mes accents aigus me sont pas disponibles..  minor corrections though.  Poisson is masculine, not feminine (even if the fish picture pictured is obviously a lady) Hence, le grand poisson, instead of (la) grande poisson.  Unless of course you're just messing with me!  And.. AND.  Your closing statement..  very noice, but.  (Venir) encore.  The word Venir should have conjugated in l'imperatif present, hence, VENEZ, used with the pronoun VOUS, or when you're addressing a general audience..  Well done my man.  I love da french, and I have to be me!  yyyeeeeeeee HD"
