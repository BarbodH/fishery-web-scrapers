Launch is about 10 mins from my parents place so it's extremely convenient.  We are slowly putting together a milkrun, week after week we try a different spot that looks good on the chartplotter and depending on the results, add it to the list of 'hot spots'.  We've pretty much figured out a pattern, which doesn't make much sense but it seems to be working   Hit up spot #1, landed a couple of small fish, but nothing to even break the camera out over..  End of spot #1 something missed my Zara Spook and left a big swirl...  One cast back and it didn't miss, unfortunately it look leader and all.  It was big...  I am guessing a big pike, easily over 15lbs, but I only saw it's back and it was thick!!!  5 mins later I see my spook float to the surface..w00t!!!  Big smile came over my face as I scooped it up with my rod tip.  I am not even going to mention the word musky, cause if it was I'll be ticked!  Hit spot #2 and immediately my dad got into a 3lb+ fish..  Then the heavens opened up and the rain came down in sheets..  Dawned the rain gear and kept at it..  I had a miss by a decent fish, then dad landed a nice pike about 5lbs right behind the boat.   About 30mins later the rain stopped I landed one about 3-4lbs, and we continued on this spot, turned around and gave it another go.  In about 19ft of water with decent weeds, a big old girl with a fat belly decided she was hungry and ate my spook.  Almost a twin to the nice fish my dad picked up early, bit with a bigger belly came un just over 4lbs.   All in all we caught about 10-15 or so, kept 4 + the pike.      And one from last week..  notice the weather was a bit better, lol  "

227401,BillM,2008-07-14 12:07:00,17367," I'll wear those out when we go 'ski fishing  :)  We usually pack it in around 11am or so, boat traffic gets insane along with the jetski's."
