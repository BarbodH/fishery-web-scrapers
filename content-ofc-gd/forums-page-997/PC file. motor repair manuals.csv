226619,forrest,2008-07-12 02:56:00,1032,there are a few for sale on ebay from $10-$15.  Compared to the Official Service Manual the CD version I bought is a 2 out of 10.  The hard copy is the way to go....you may find one in the local library.  forrest
226667,Zamboni,2008-07-12 11:38:00,235,"There are original manufacturers shop manuals on pdf files for a lot of engines now Forrest. Whatever you bought on CD obviously wasn't a shop manual but they do exist for more and more engines.  Leaving at 10am for a week on Simcoe Curt, if I find manual you need before that I'll pm you link. Mostly just have merc manuals myself-that was my specialty till town/neighbours and I came to an ""understanding"" that I wouldn't work on boats in our driveway anymore."

The ones from Ken Cook are copies of the original OMC manuals, but they are very pricey. I buy most of my manuals on eBay and they are much cheaper. You will find the Seloc/Clymer manuals next to useless since they cover so many models and hp's, but they are better than nothing and will show you the basics. As said, a hard copy is much better."
