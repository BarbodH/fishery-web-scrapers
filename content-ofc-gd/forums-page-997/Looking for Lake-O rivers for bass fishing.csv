227333,gone_fishin,2008-07-14 08:01:00,481,"have caught a few smallmouths near the mouth of duffin's but they are rare... also in the rouge, and also rare... never really targeted bass too much in the rivers, usually hit the lakes for them... you'd probably do better taking a run up to Scugog or Rice and fish off shore there...  good luck!"
227346,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-14 10:41:00,2585,"if you fish the east end of lake o, 16 mile, bronte, credit river and all the rivers and creeks from hamilton to st catherines all hold bass.  cheers!"
227404,BITEME,2008-07-14 12:09:00,1969,Ther are no fish in Oakville it is a dead water system!!!!!!!!
227418,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-07-14 12:43:00,0,"Ok, I was also told that bass dont stay in pools rather than in moving water section of the river .. is that true?  If so, where should I target them?  Thanks!"
227426,Billy Bob,2008-07-14 12:55:00,5865,I have caught MANY smallies in pools. Just not my neighbor's pool
227482,MuddyWater,2008-07-14 15:37:00,218,i doubt the bass would be around creeks right now best bet is to find rock peirs and chuck baits around those ill be out for some when the winds calm down.... oh yea they school tight in lake O
227484,charlied,2008-07-14 15:53:00,584,your best bet...head to the Niagara River for a whole day....tons of bass there.
227493,bassmaster4,2008-07-14 16:21:00,801,or you could try the grand river that place has a lot of bass lol
