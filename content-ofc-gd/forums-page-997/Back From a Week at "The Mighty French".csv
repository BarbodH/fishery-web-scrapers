227273,joonmoon,2008-07-14 01:43:00,528,"Finished nightshift on Sat morn packed up and hit the road by 9:30am arriving early afternoon without as much as a wink of sleep. Partially cause of the excitement and anticipation of the week to come but mostly cause of the multiple Timmies consumed while packing and loading the boat and trailer up. Arrived mid afternoon and enjoyed friends company and played a little Texas Horseshoes...throwing large washers at holes in a board trying to get to 21 first...lol. But during the first few hours I was mentally distracted by the lure of the dock, so eventually I secumbed to the temptation and stood on the dock to cast a bucktail...ah I was at peace...but whoa fish on, now I'm at peace...lol. Within a few moments I was starting the fish count for the week. Pike #1 a hammerhandle but a good start.  Several casts later another a little bigger but spit the buck. As the evening went on I was becoming more and more stupid with the lack of sleep... 10:30 pm its time to crash, and down I went. The next morning was promising with the thought of working my fav weedbeds since they haven't reached the surface yet leaving enuff space to burn a bucktail between them and the surface. Out in the boat we went, casting, casting, and more casting...after hours of casting and only one pike my need for more coffee won the fight, so in we went to have a late lunch and recharge the caffine system. Now to shorten things up a little Sunday nite my better half and I decided to troll before sundown at a secret but known area. Caught another pike and as the sun dropped below the treeline on the ridge she says my fav words ""FISH ON""...music to my ears. As the rod thumps and bulldawgs deep shes thinking nice bass or pike but I'm thinking hmmmm I've seen this before......  22"" about 4-5 lber right in the slot and a beauty spawner too. Measure and pic and released at the dock as we packed it in due to the skeeters becoming a major issue.  Nice thoughts to go to bed with, dancing walleyes in my head. Hoping to have a few for the table but good to see one in the slot too. Tuesday was to be our visit to the west arm. We trolled by LakeAir in the ""AUGUSTAWIND"" and looked for fellow OFNCers but no one was there, dang got the dates mixed up again, when is the big G2G? Did we miss it again?...dang. Gotta mark it on the calendar...lol.  Trolled Warren Bay, worked the weedlines, jigged the drop-offs, casted to visible structure, tried shallow, tried deep and finally I broke down and anchored just off a weedline frustrated and out of ideas for fishing walleyes...nada. I pulled out my fav bucktail and realized we were in the same area that produced a large member of the Esox family for me 2 years previous. With the anticipation of a huge explosion I threw a medium distance cast at the weeds and began to burn it across the surface.  Not even three cranks on my reel and I felt what was the equivalent of a wookie trying to rip my arm out of its socket...""FISH ON"" and a doozie one to boot. It was a pike and it swam quickly towards the boat and once in sight it began to turn and dawg and headshake and freak out like a typical pike but this monster had lots of weight to her and to keep it from burying itself in the weeds it took every ounce of strength I had. Several short bursts of speed later it was back at boatside and scooped by my better half in the net. Ahh relax time but my heart would have nothing to do do with that.  She was 36"" and approx 10-12 lbs of pure Esox muscle. What a beauty. A few quik pics measure and back to the drink she went. My day was made.   All toll I boated 16 pike from the French, 3 Largemouth, and 2 12"" perch and the monster from Nip. Not a bad week, even though I didn't get a bucktail or jerkbait visit from the other member of the Esox family. My wife didn't spend the time on the water that I did but she boated 5 pike and the awesome eye. Now that was a relaxing holiday...lol."
227377,Victor,2008-07-14 11:38:00,1609,wow very nice wally&pike joonmoon!  water looks kinda rough for the Augustawind ... i guess it handles the chop alright?
227381,ccmtcanada,2008-07-14 11:44:00,7971,Sweet report!  That's one great looking walleye...a GREAT catch.  That pike is a real beauty as well!  Lakair was the weekend of June 21st...so you missed out by a few weeks there!
227387,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-14 11:53:00,0,Great Report. The scenery up there alone makes the trip worth while and it sounds like you guys both got a nice bonus fish. Thanks for sharing.
227439,steve_paul,2008-07-14 13:48:00,658,"Nice job guys.  As JB says, the beauty alone makes it a great trip - those nice fish are bonus.  Thanks for the report and congrats on the fish."

227471,joonmoon,2008-07-14 14:49:00,528,"It was an excellent week up there as always, anywhere is better than being at work right? The ""AUGUSTAWIND"" handles some nasty waters with ease until you have to paddle.....squares rotate in circles...lol. Gotta luv the north."
227495,jediangler,2008-07-14 16:24:00,1923,"Great report and pics Bro. That ""Cooler w/seats"" really gets around doesn't it. Nice walleye Goog and nice pikey Bro. Soon you'll be chasing skis on Pigeon."

227530,highdrifter,2008-07-14 18:16:00,2534,"NICE!  Just wondering though, what kind of net, if any, did you use to land her?  cheers HD"
227541,joonmoon,2008-07-14 18:42:00,528,"Ya Bro visions of Skis dancing in my head...lol. We have a cradle we use to land anything over 30"". and a landing net both work well."
227544,highdrifter,2008-07-14 18:53:00,2534,"Ah kewl.  She does seem to have some war wounds on her, which is an indication of rough netting..  She looks fine though..  I'm just being overly protective!  cheers! HD"
227550,solopaddler,2008-07-14 19:07:00,8605,"Hey, great report and congrat's on the beauty pike!"
