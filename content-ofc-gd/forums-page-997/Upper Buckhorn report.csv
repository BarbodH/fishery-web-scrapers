226833,JeffBornFishin,2008-07-12 22:35:00,260,OK slept in late this am...oops.  Hit the water at noon.  Chemong was not too busy even with the Top Bass Tourney going on.  No luck on Chemong so off I went to Buckhorn Lake.  Hit my usual spots.  Got some small bass and a bunch of perch.  Switched up the lures; yay stink bait!  I managed this beauty smallie on a Senko rigged Carolina style.        She put up one heck of a fight.  Went deep into the weeds but I managed to horse her outta there.  Weighed in at just shy of 3 pounds.  Eighteen inches in length.  What a fattie!  I tried reviving her but had no luck.  The fight was too much.  She is currently in my freezer.  Probably get Her mounted as she has beauty colours.  So back to fishing.  More perch and small bass.  Moved on to another part of the lake.  Had to be twenty or so boats all doing the drift sock thing.  Put on the new this year Rapala X Rap Shad Rap and within three casts got this nice Walleye.      Weighed in at just over a pound.  Sucessfully released  The weather started getting rough so I called it a day.  Was a great afternoon even with the Gore-Tex on a couple times.  Just some light showers.  Heading back out tomorrow.  Hey She qualifes for an OFAH Angler Award!  Two bonus inches coming up for Team 8 TangledAnglers!
