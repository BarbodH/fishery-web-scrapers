And that is good news for the boating and shipping industry.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers predicts that Lake Michigan and Huron should be up at least 15 centimetres from very low levels in 2007.  And Lake St. Clair could rise by five centimetres.  Lake Superior is expected to be up 30 centimetres by June.  The levels of Lakes Erie and Ontario are predicted to be higher than in 2007 although slightly lower than last year.  Windsor's harbour master Bill Marshall said higher levels allow ships to get into more ports, and when the ships are able to load more goods it becomes cheaper per tonne to move."
