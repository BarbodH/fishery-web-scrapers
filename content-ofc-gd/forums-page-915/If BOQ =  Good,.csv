I spoke to a guy there who said the fishing was okay at the moment but not spectacular.   The ice is about 9 inches thick at the moment.  Im not sure where there is to get any bait near Brighton, (I assume that you mean minnows) I will try and find out tomorrow and let you know.  I hope to get out for a few ours tomorrow night after work."
