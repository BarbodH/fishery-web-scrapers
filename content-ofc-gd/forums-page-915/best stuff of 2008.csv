290119,forrest,2009-01-10 01:15:00,1032,"At the end of 2008 I posted a request for best 2008 posts and wanted to set up some kind of vote.  A lot of people referred to great repeat posters but there were not many specifics given.  It was agreed that there are a lot of good posts, pics and fish in 2008 and that it would be unfair to say anyone was the best.  Maybe next year there will be actual firm categories  I received a few PMs.  So if you want to see what others thought were notable in 2008 here is the original thread and links to a few other threads submitted by OFNers:  Thread: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry281810  Leechman for his ""2008 Full Report - Outaouais, From Hard to Soft Water until Now http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=25729&hl=  MooseBunk for his "" The Arctic Expedition., Great Bear Lakers & Tree River Char.

290132,forrest,2009-01-10 01:38:00,1032," Ooops...sorry if I missed an email to me.  I was not deciding who to include and not include and there are so many posters there will be more that did not make it in the thread.  I always read Snag's stuff, they are never unentertaining (they are some of the best), I love his stuff too!  here are a couple of Snag posts that stuck in my mind: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry272588 http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry251885"

290137,forrest,2009-01-10 01:43:00,1032,"  I only posted what was sent to me , however, if there was a poster that repeated ""new PB"" more than anyone else I would bet it was CCMT"
290139,ccmtcanada,2009-01-10 01:46:00,7971,When you've only been fishing for 2 years getting PB's is pretty easy...and I post for both Bly and I....but thanks
290140,BillM,2009-01-10 01:47:00,17367,"Cliff, I am just happy to get an honorable mention from Mike  :)"
290142,forrest,2009-01-10 01:48:00,1032,  And here I was thinking you were lousy at bragging
290322,Leecher,2009-01-10 16:51:00,7832, Same here Cliff.... It's flattering to be nominated but certainly don't belong in that list amongst the top posters like Moose and Solo..... I'm always in awe when I read their stories and adventures   Keep it up guys  I have a feeling we'll be treated to a bunk report soon....  Jacques aka Leechman
