289993,muskiesRus,2009-01-09 19:38:00,18,Worked 12 hour shifts for 38 years!!!!! Can honestly say I don't miss them very much - IN FACT NOT AT ALL.
290002,Fisherman,2009-01-09 19:58:00,7201,"Man, you got that right, don't miss one second of it, now I know when the sun comes up, it's time for ""bacon & eggs"",  your body schedule gets regular,  you know at 07:15, it's time to pinch a coil, and when Peter Mansbridge comes, it's bed time."
290020,solopaddler,2009-01-09 21:05:00,8605,  12 hour shifts would be awesome. Mine are 16 hours  .

290043,bigugli,2009-01-09 22:11:00,6138,"I did not mind 12 hour shifts. Spent 5 years doing straight 12's, five nights a week.  It was the commuting that was horrible."
290046,ccmtcanada,2009-01-09 22:21:00,7971,Ohh...thought you meant fishing night shift....        
290147,centerpin_drift,2009-01-10 02:05:00,94,"my night shift consists of 12 hours tearing a sled up down and around blue mountain making snow, adrenaline is a key factor to staying awake.  the only down time is when out gear is drying by the compressors, and in the wee hours of the morning, OFC keeps me fills the void."
290152,irishfield,2009-01-10 02:11:00,26272,Stop blowing that wet stuff CP... too hard on my old knees goin under the guns !
290242,charlied,2009-01-10 05:09:00,584,Night shift.....just be thankful you actually can go to work and make money!
290246,SlowPoke,2009-01-10 05:59:00,2984,"I've been on nights for 137 years straight.. at least it feels that way. I don't gripe about the hours but the job is getting old. After 3,000,000 kms between London and Toronto over the years, I still can't say ""I've seen it all"" but I'm damn close! The hours work well for me/us. It offers more family time than a regular day gig when compared to most truck drivers. -Brian"
