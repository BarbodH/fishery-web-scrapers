289647,Lowe Rider,2009-01-08 23:05:00,79,"  Thanks for that quick reply, I guess I need to check the fine print. That would mean 4x4ing would be out as well if you had that clause."
289648,irishfield,2009-01-08 23:11:00,26272,Exactly.. as would being in your laneway... a store parking lot etc. I'm sure it's written into some policies... but not mine as far as I know. Most of the extractions on the towing website Matt posted are insurance jobs. They bid on the tender just like I do to retrieve crashed airplanes. Just imagine 600 man hours @ $50 to $120 an hour + equipment time.
289652,Bernie,2009-01-08 23:20:00,3190,"Have a movie dad took from the late 1950's where a friend was taking building supplies across to his cottage and went through. It took 6 guys 5 hours to cut the ice out to shore, hook a chain on it with an old anchor and use a come-along to pull it to shore. I think they even got it running and drove it home."
289683,irishfield,2009-01-09 00:24:00,26272,Only 30 man hours Bernie... you can see they weren't gettin paid or had the labour board looking over their shoulders! lol The labour board is a big issue these days... even stopping contractors from travelling by boat thru light ice to my neighbours in late Nov/early Dec.
289811,2 tone z71,2009-01-09 03:33:00,1311,"yeah Wayne ,there out there and leaned on us pretty hard this yr,I thought we where good at hiding, but they find ya via building permits, pissy neighbours ,other contractors etc"
289813,irishfield,2009-01-09 03:43:00,26272,..and over zealous building inspectors.
289862,BassAsin,2009-01-09 06:23:00,806,"ok so as for goin throught the ice it is property damage or environmental damage and if it is sticking out  an 1/8"" it now becomes a liability if somone hits it. and insurance does cover if your company says no call the insurance board.  as for the MOL i just spent 16 hours in class on a rigging and hoisting course to exract trucks and have another 4 hours for on ice stuff i need a course for.  our divers can only go down on a volunteer basis otherwise 2 certified divers have to be in the water and one above ice controlling a regulated air tank and and blah blah blah! and our rig now has to be steel and  stamped certified engineered becasue wood is no longer strong enough now a days i guess!  and as for cutting a hole all the way to shore i guess they werent a mile or more out and others must have just loved them after that putting a big hole in the lake for the rest of the folk maybe should have taken a smaller load! hahah have heard many stories to date as to why they went through and all are just as funny from one to the next unless there is a tragedy involving someones health or a death.  and yes they are insurance jobs that get bid on and can hit the 60 000$ mark at times what people dont realize is there is a price on everything up to the ""rental"" of a pylon,  they have to pay themselves off somehow over time! and pay rate is quite respectable becasue of all the MOL training we must attend makes us government qualified and it is now law."
290071,Lowe Rider,2009-01-09 23:06:00,79,"  Unfortunately, people with common sense are getting screwed on the job because of stupid people. I've been told to wear my hard hat inside my excavator. What! if something comes through the roof of that thing a little piece of plastic isn't going to help me. I was told someone was working close to a building and stuck his head out to talk to someone and was hit by something from the roof. That is why, not law though. I told the inspector to give me a ticket and I'll see you in court, never did , wonder why? Another example is tying off with a harness at all times on  motor lifts. Why? Cause some moron climbed on the railing when the thing didn't reach and fell to serious injury or death, must have left the common sense at home. Another pet peeve of mine is needing to be certified to hook up propane. I can't do it at work because it's dangerous without training but at home the same propane tank can be hooked up to the BBQ no problem. Asked my trainer what the difference was and he said there wasn't one. I don't see my buddy next door putting on the face shield, neoprene gloves and protective clothing as he put a new tank on the barbie. He always does the whosh explosion thing when he starts it, so who's more dangerous.  It's going to come to the point that nothing will get done because of all the regs. Safety is great, just don't pick on me in the middle of a field with no hard hat on, use common sense, go pick on the brick layers, they never set up the scaffold right.  I would never do anything to put my life on the line for work and you can avoid dangerous situations if you use common sense.  Sorry for the rant. I feel better though."
290125,rob v,2009-01-10 01:28:00,535,"Sure makes you wanna think twice about driving on unsafe ice !!   On some of those jobs, wouldn't it have been easier to mark the vehicle, wait until spring and yank it out from shore then ?? Even if you had to pump the fuel outta the tank somehow while it was in the water  to minimize enivronmental issues."
290127,irishfield,2009-01-10 01:33:00,26272,There's probably more fuel spilled each week at the local marina than an entire tank of fuel in the vehicle Rob. Gasoline evaporates pretty much totally off the water surface. The 6 litres of oil in the engine is more of a hazard. Also with the newer vehicles and their pressurized fuel systems and filler caps they may not actually leak out.
290233,rob v,2009-01-10 04:10:00,535,"Makes me wonder even more about why they go to so much trouble to get the darned things our as soon as they can.  My guess is the vehicles aren't salvagable/worth much after getting dunked.  So why instead of spending so much time and effort cutting the bloody things outta the ice don't they wait until it's a bit easier ?    I'm sure there's good reason for some i.e. too far off shore etc, but others - what the heck - wait till the ice is gone, hook up a cable and drag the darned thing out then ?  Maybe I'm not thinking this through enough ?"
290234,forrest,2009-01-10 04:21:00,1032," My list of reasons would include:  -Would it be easier to get a car salvage barge out on the lake? -dragging trucks out of a lake cant be too good for the bottom. -""uh...I can't remember how many trucks went down or where they were"" -Why procrastinate? -""who left their truck in the water right in the way of my lower unit?"""

290258,outllaw,2009-01-10 12:13:00,1232,wow. just leave the kia for structure... good place for it.
290265,lew,2009-01-10 13:11:00,12767," I agree with you 100% Lowe Rider and am not arguing with you at all, inact I've said the same thing many times, that we're often totally overwhelmed with saftey rules in the workplace, infact often to the point where it would be nearly impossible to do our jobs succesfully if we followed all the rules to the letter.  I spent 32 years as a fireman here in Toronto and we had saftey rules & regs coming out our ying yang, many of them good, but others totally inappropriate for that type of work. You get to the scene of the emergency, get in and then out...hopefully...the best way you can and often have to break every rule in the book to do what's necessary.  I  was on the 1st arriving truck at a house fire one night and was met by a hysterical woman on the sidewalk who informed us her husband was still upstairs. I made a quick judgement call, ran upstairs alone without an airmask on, grabbed the guy and dragged him outside, and was then chastized by the boss for not putting on a mask.  I had alot of experience on the job and knew what I was doing, yet because I broke ""a safety rule"" I was in the wrong according to those in charge. Trouble was, the guy who chastized me arrived 1/2 and hour after the fact and wasn't even there to know 1st hand the reason for what was done.  What I did is nothing unusual, infact it happens every day of the year, yet it's considered wrong because it goes against the writen ""rule""  When I went on the job more than 40 years ago, there were far less rules, yet we still got the job done, and now I think workers are aften over burdened by un-necessary rules.  I remember a time when garbage men were required to wear hard hats because thy may fall and hit their head on the sidewalk. Once they explained that the mayor could also fall in his office and hit his head on the floor, the rule was recinded.  My son was an iron worker for 20 years and worked the high steel all over the world, including 2 years in Shanghai and Bejing China where he was foreman on a job erecting 2 high office towers.  No matter where or when they worked, and no matter how high the job, they nearly always clipped on their saftey harnesses  to whatever they could, but from talking to my son many many times about his job over the years, it's understandable that often, because of circumstances, they just had to leave the harness off to get from one spot to another. I knew alot of his co-workers and they all said the same thing. Harnesses are obviously a very important part of their gear, but often the job required them to be left off.  Unfortunately, on December 13th, 2004, my son was working on the high steel and had to remove his harness to move from one spot to another, and unfortunately, that was the time something terrible, and to this day unknown happened and he fell to his death.  Every iron worker I talked to said they'd done the exact same thing 1000's of times.  I didn't mean to ramble on like this, but I guess my point is that saftey rules & regs are OK most of the time, but due to so many different circumstances in the the daily grind of those of us doing dangerous work, the rules have to be discarded or circumvented, and most times we can get away with it, but often it backfires and people die.  Again Lowe Rider, I'm agreeing with your post 100%, saftey rules are both good and necessary, as long as they don't go over board with them."

290286,Lowe Rider,2009-01-10 14:29:00,79,"   I would just like to say Thank you Lew for your years of service doing a job I would never be able to do. I have two friends who are Metro Police and my dad's good friend (ret) who was in the Fire dept in North Bay, I have heard some of the stories good and bad about your job and theirs.  I know I couldn't do it but I'm grateful there are people like you and my friends who can.  I know safety regs are there for a reason and peoples lives depend on them but it just seems like they are getting so silly with some of them these days.  I'm sorry to hear about your son, sounds like he made his father proud.  Those Steelworkers are a hardy bunch and they amaze me on any project I've ever been on. Then again I get nervous on a 10 ft ladder  .  To the OP sorry for screwing up your thread.   Chris."

They have done it in some sled and ATV policies... but I haven't seen it on, at least my, vehicle policies.  Apparently there is a new wrinkle with the labour board for bringing vehicles up. Diver must be not only commercially certified.. but there is a new CSA  (or some similar) requirement to be registered. A few Temagami divers just found out the hard way that they can't help recover the Kia and could have been grandfathered if someone had of told them prior to 2005. Now they have to take more diving courses if they want to do this kind of work.  Matt.. your tow company divers my be in the same boat!  Also sounds like the Kia occupants were extremely lucky. They (3) got out UNDER water after it went to bottom in 18 FOW."
