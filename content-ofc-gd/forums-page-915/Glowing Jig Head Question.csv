Maybe a dumb question, but how do they glow?  Do you need to charge them with a light before they go down the hole?  If so, how long do they remain ""charged""?  Thanks."
289964,kemper,2009-01-09 17:14:00,2232,"Probably a camera flash would be your best bet for charging them.  Fire them up and sendem down the hole and see how long they last, Im sure different products have different times"

Don't be too eager to recharge the glow, sometimes the fish just want a faint glow, other times they want a bright glow. Experiment with them and let the fish tell you what they want.  I haven't had much success with glow anything during complete darkness hours, but have had great results during early morning, later afternoon, on cloudy days, and in muddy water."
