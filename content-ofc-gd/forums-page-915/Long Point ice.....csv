Last week's frigid temperatures made for what was expected to be a promising start to the season as early as this Saturday.  But this week's warmer weather has put Sherman's Ice Fishing's opening on ice, so to speak.  ""It's not looking good for Saturday,"" said Kevin Sherman, who owns and operates the ice fishing huts off of the St. Williams shore. ""We need a minimum of -10 to -15C at night to make good ice.""  Saturday's forecast calls for rain and a temperature of 2C, which isn't helping Sherman's cause.  Snow doesn't help the situation either, as it insulates the existing ice and slows down the freezing process.  Sherman has been out every day drilling holes, checking for ice density.  There are six to seven good inches of ice just off the shore, he said, but another mile out and the base of ice is only four inches thick.  ""That's not enough for me,"" Sherman said. ""Some guys are going out on their own but it's a different situation for me to be running families with children out there. I like to have a good six to seven inches of solid ice.""  Most of Lake Erie's Inner Bay only froze New Year's Eve.  ""People are pretty understanding that it hasn't been that cold,"" Sherman said.  Sherman said ice fishers' best bet is to call mid week next week.  ""Hopefully it will get cold and stay cold,"" he said."
