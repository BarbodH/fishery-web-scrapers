My morning started with 5 deer crossing the path at the bottom of the hill I was walking down. They were gone by the time I got down to where they were.  My two vids narrate my morning,so I wont need to type to much.  Heres some photos of the area and the two vids of my morning.  The deer sign is unbelieveable down there. They must be yarding here.  Safety first        <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vidmg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/misfish/pic02289.flv"">            <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vidmg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/misfish/pic02297.flv"">    And a pic of te bay whn I got back.

I'm thinkin' wild hog... but it'd prolly be tough to tell which is which in the ""trophy pic"".  If it's warm enough to go huntin'... it's warm enough to carry your sorry  out on the ice and catch me a fish to look at!!!"
290492,Terry,2009-01-11 00:27:00,14456,looks like fun  where are the deer when you can shoot them  too bad you didn't have snowshoes..LOL

290555,misfish,2009-01-11 02:14:00,29133,"Why do my vids turn out with me still talking when thier done?   Yes it was fun,and Dawg,when I get my 09 lic,I,ll be out there."
290596,Leecher,2009-01-11 03:32:00,7832, I noticed that they were off a bit but sure looked like a great day to be out in the bush Too bad you weren't deer hunting instead by the looks of it  Thanks for taking the time to post your results of your outing Jacques
290606,douG,2009-01-11 03:52:00,2693,"That was great, Brian, always enjoy your stories.  Pretty savvy on the game tracking, and the posting too.  Soup soon?  PigeonFisher is out to lunch, somewhere else, maybe in a different country.  Maybe Raf might like to join in some lunch too."
290608,misfish,2009-01-11 03:54:00,29133," Yes it was Jacques.  Sometimes I forget what it,s like,and once I get out there,I dont want to come back in."
