289799,RickOnt,2009-01-09 03:14:00,669,"Travelling on Cook's is still very good, However a LOT more snow than last weekend!!!  Roaches Point  You will  find 5-6"" of Ice. Pumphouse and the Fingers  8""  Bikes and Sleds travelling with no problems,  No Slush or cracks.  Lots of Fish being caught,  This will likely be the Last busy weekend in Gilford,  By next weekend Innisfil and North should be Good to Go!!!  Rick"

Saturday went back out to the same spot with no luck first thing, had to move around alot after trying about 8 spots settled in 24 fow and got into some decent action fished until 10 and ended up catching around 30 fish and ended up keeping ten. I think i'll hit innisfil park this weekend for some perch and hopefully a rogue whitefish...lol"
