290149,Clampet,2009-01-10 02:08:00,1947,Here's one that was caught recently from some ceement pond!    
290153,Beats,2009-01-10 02:13:00,543,"""I think we're gonna need a bigger auger"""
290154,cram,2009-01-10 02:17:00,1733,Beautiful pike.   15 lbs?

290162,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-10 02:28:00,3761,21.8lbs
290164,douG,2009-01-10 02:31:00,2693,"Just to annoy Whitespinnerbait, I guess 18.5.  The real question is, does Clamp it know the answer?  This could be like deja vu all over again like never before."
290166,Greencoachdog,2009-01-10 02:34:00,8163,Heavier than Jed has ever caught and Jethro has ever et!
290172,Muskieman,2009-01-10 02:45:00,2472,"I'm guessing that that pike would weigh closer to 23lbs+ or so I've got a 40"" 20lbs on my wall and the one in that pic is much fatter .    RFS "
290175,jwl,2009-01-10 02:52:00,1056,I have caught quite a few pike in the 40 incher plus range and a couple pushing 48 inches..average weight for a fish like that is probably in the range of 20-22 lbs.....yes I have weighed a couple
290179,forrest,2009-01-10 02:56:00,1032,"It is on the net.  It weighs nothing, OK....the light emitting the pic weights a little."
290180,forrest,2009-01-10 02:58:00,1032,  Well Clampit?
290184,TennesseeGuy,2009-01-10 03:03:00,957,"Due to her short face, I say, multiply 40"" X 40"" X 40"" then divide by 3500.  Add two pounds and that should be close to the weight.  It would help to know the height and weight of the guy in the photo."
290194,forrest,2009-01-10 03:15:00,1032," There is no way that pike is 5, 9 and 159lbs.  Is there a known answer to be posted?  forrest"
290196,irishfield,2009-01-10 03:17:00,26272,What do you smoke Forrest?  ..I'll question Jed later....
290197,Sinker,2009-01-10 03:19:00,8692,
290201,Greencoachdog,2009-01-10 03:21:00,8163," Jus' going under the assumption that it's pretty lame that someone can't cath their own fish and has to post pics of someone else's... if you could catch one that big, you'd be showing us a pic of your fish eh!!!  ... and now it's x2!!!"
290205,Gerritt,2009-01-10 03:24:00,6129,/me awaits for the twilight zone theme song to begin.....  too weird..  G
290214,bucktail,2009-01-10 03:36:00,1857,hmmm if she is 40 inches and she looks nice and chunky I would guess 21lbs.
290216,Bernie,2009-01-10 03:38:00,3190,
290222,goteeboy,2009-01-10 03:45:00,175,"i caught a 44 inch 22lb pike in spring. this might be shorter, but it is fatter so i would say minimum 18lbs"
290223,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-10 03:46:00,2582,19.4. No clue...but I googled for a fair guess.
290224,Gerritt,2009-01-10 03:47:00,6129,"Hmmmm... should I be offended???   Got a problem, Polack!, Today, 10:32 PM  A little entertainment too much fer ya.
