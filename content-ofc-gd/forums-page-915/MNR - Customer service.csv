290072,tinbanger,2009-01-09 23:07:00,1028,"just a little positive customer service story about our friends at MNR .  Earlier today I emailied a question to MNR via there website ( ""contact us"") . It was answered via return email  in less than 15 minutes with the advice/info I needed. Called the Ministry department suggested ,phone answered by a real person , who managed to solve my issue in under 5 minutes.   who says customer service is dead.... or should I be buying a lottery ticket !
