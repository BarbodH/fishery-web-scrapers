289557,bassjnkie,2009-01-08 18:38:00,1101,"I read on another site the Shimano bought Innovative Textiles, Inc., the makers of Power Pro. Now Shimano really has it all, great for them and great for us.  daniel"
289560,diggyj,2009-01-08 19:16:00,548,"Its true.  http://fish.shimano.com/publish/content/gl...n_acquires.html  Not sure why they did, I think it's kind of a crappy line. What do others think about it?"
289561,Raf,2009-01-08 19:21:00,3495,one man's trash is another's treasure diggyj.  i use power pro almost exclusively as far as braids go.
289563,kemper,2009-01-08 19:37:00,2232,"Best braid out there no question.  Its invincible, and  casts like a champ"
289638,salmon,2009-01-08 22:51:00,334, Kemper You have not tried Sufix SPB yet. Jose
289694,OhioFisherman,2009-01-09 00:39:00,6623,"Just a different view, don`t know if having just a few big companies controlling the market and products offered is  a good thing. Might become more of what they want to sell you than what you want to buy. Makes it easier for them to control pricing."
289713,bassjnkie,2009-01-09 00:58:00,1101, I really didn't think of it that way. Control everything and price goes up.
289745,lhousesoccer,2009-01-09 01:48:00,442, Me too.  Nothing but PowerPro when it comes to braid for me.
289758,douG,2009-01-09 02:09:00,2693,"I think that this is a fine time to mention that PowerPro contains SpectraFiber, a Honeywell product."
289761,bucktail,2009-01-09 02:16:00,1857,"Have tried all the braids out there and I stick with power pro, not perfect but the right combo of properties. Now if more places sold it in bulk that would be great."
289767,Roy,2009-01-09 02:22:00,13728, Now would also be a fine time to mention that SpectraFiber was discovered by pure happenstance when 5 Honeywell employees were sitting around the lunchroom picking at and examining their navel lint.
289888,NAC,2009-01-09 13:17:00,369,Now that is some insight Roy!  and a bit funny too.  I use power pro for all my warm water fishing as well.
