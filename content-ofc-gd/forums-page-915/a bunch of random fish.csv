290168,BassAsin,2009-01-10 02:39:00,806,"so today i took a break from the courses and training and had a day on the lake with 2 friends jeff and rob(stylincatch) on lake nipissing. we were out targetting wallies.  we started off with a quick bite and a pile of perch, which we let go 9 in total. jeff pulled a nice keeper of a walleye about an inch under the slot and i followed up with the first whitie of the season on a sweedish pimp. and finally a nice 19 incher at 2 lbs to end the night had to let it go and it didnt burp the stomach either! all said and done the day total was 1pike 2wallies 1whitefish 9perch  rob caught 3 jeff 3 and myself 7  a great time was had by all with some laughs and impressive 40 yard dashes the NY giants would be proud of! and the area ""sunset cove"" speaks for itself in the last pic!
