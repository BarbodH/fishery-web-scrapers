I'm a shore fisher but I like the idea of pens to get a chiiny fishery off our port good going to all involved"
290436,rhare,2009-01-10 22:31:00,387,"these guys have been working hard on the pen projects around the lake, this is great news for the fishery.  look forward to hearing more scott    Ryan"
290439,fishindevil,2009-01-10 22:42:00,6254,"Great news thanks for the info scotty !!!!   and please pass on any & all info,as we are definately interested,and i for sure will attend,as i know many other members will,the meetings at bobby C's !!!! it sure does sound like a great idea....cheers"
290447,Scotty Richardson,2009-01-10 22:55:00,4,"Sorry guys just real excited about this....What it is going to be is pens for chinook salmon to be raised  for aprox 6 weeks.Pen rearing projects allow hatchery produced fish to ""smolt"" in other locations and get the ""scent"" of the tributaries that they are pen raised in. In turn these fish will return in a few years as adults to these locations to spawn.Involvement is 100% volunteer and a group effort by all.  1) Pen Rearing Sites have benefited return ratios as high as 7:1 over direct stocked salmonoids  2)Higher survival rates of juvenile fish  3)OUTSTANDING FISHING!"
290457,fishindevil,2009-01-10 23:24:00,6254,"Thanks for the clarification scotty !!!!  where do you think the pens would be located ???? in the marsh area by the mouth,or beside the pier,out from the rocks somewhere ????"
290458,Scotty Richardson,2009-01-10 23:31:00,4,the actual spot is not yet known Shawn but will be somewhere close to the flow in around the boat docks.
290469,fishindevil,2009-01-10 23:48:00,6254,"Oh well i guess the pens are not that big,thats why i was wondering where they would put them where they could imprint,as there is not alot of room in the harbor anyways !!! maybe over by where the retaining wall at the end of the condos are,its kind of empty over thereor maybe in the corner where gordy & kim park their boats...."
290693,Spiel,2009-01-11 14:23:00,9065,"....Great, more chinooks."
