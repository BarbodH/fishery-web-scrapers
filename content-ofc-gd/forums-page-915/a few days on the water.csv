289069,BassAsin,2009-01-07 19:10:00,806,"so here we are in the new year and another season of specks begins, this year being a little more significant than most i got the chance to have my 2 best friends come with me my father who now lives a few hours from me and my best friend james who is a few hours the other way from me. we all managed to reunite and have a blast of a day, after working graveyard and getting off work at 3 am james had about an hour of sleep before leaving to meet my dad at 6. my dad said like a kid before christmas he didnt get a wink of sleep. good to know that the excitement doesnt fade with age it seems as though it actually becomes ever growing! So we get the skidoo's unloaded a family of them a ciation short track a tundra and a tundra long track 62 years of sled experience between the 3! we broke trail the 3 miles into the lake to meet 2 other lads fishing already and to our suprise over the course of the fall a logging road (and much easier) trail was put in.  none the less we had our 6 lines in before sun up and were welcomed to a beautiful sunrise. at about 8 oclock we hit a small frenzy, james missing the same fish 3 times before pulling one up, and likewise with my dad, he only missed twice HAHAHA as for me i was running the video camera and getting some chuckles. nearing 10 oclock all 3 of us got into some fish putting the total at 5, lots of good times a good fire and some grilled cheese and we were all set for another run 2 more around noon and a missed fish put the total at 7 for the day my dad left early around 1 ish james and i satyed till close to 2:30 and missed one more at -20C the lines were freezing in pretty quick!  January 2nd the 3 of us managed to get out again for about 6 hours and one bite all day and no fish! on a different lake.  so happy new year to all and sorry i didnt get a pile of pictures, was more interested in the video (santa was nice to me and left a camcorder)   "
289070,BassAsin,2009-01-07 19:15:00,806,"January 5th  my buddy rob (stylincatch) and i got out for pike on a little pond where we have pulled out 10 pounders as kids, caught a 12 inch pike and missed a 7-10 pounder in the hole! i was kinda disapointed.  jan 6th managed to get out to nippissing for a few hours in the evening went to a random spot miles from any shack,shoreline,person. managed to catch 6 perch and snapped an awesome shot of rob jiggin his tip up,  the bush chiken was taken on the second with the new camera/camcorder at about 65 yards and to my suprise it turned out well!

289872,Moosebunk,2009-01-09 12:30:00,3970,Good read man.  Even though that logging road was in it probably felt more rewarding when you guys got those fish after breaking trail.  Fun times in the 09.
