289918,bigugli,2009-01-09 14:30:00,6138,Nice little story to read over my morning coffee. You had a fun and interesting week. Good on ya
288686,Ramble,2009-01-07 00:23:00,713," January 4th  The next morning, Jeff and I were back out off the safe side of Point Anne with his little sister perching again.    A balmy -13, and with my coffee I sat extremely content jigging up the odd perch. Jeff and his sister were in the 2 man hut having a riot.        I was releasing most of my fish and kept only bleeders, or good sized eaters. The kept inviting me inside, but I would much rather site out side in the ice with the wind at my back.        I ended up with 15 total. The biggest being 12.5 inches.      Jeff’s pile had 30 some perch. He had 2 which were bigger then my biggest. 1 caught by his sister, and the other by him. She defiantly has the perching touch.    He left at noon after about 4.5 hours of fishing. I stayed out after he did till about 1pm playing with the perch. I moved a little and got into them pretty good a few times.  Areas with snow or white ice seemed more productive then clear ice. I’m still wondering if shade was playing some sort of role for the perch.  A few time I had both lines going off at the same time. It it’s not only a hell of a good time but mildly confusing when you are out alone. The ultra light didn’t disappoint either and got another good work out. I’m not sure how many I landed total, but I bet it was 50 or more.        After Jeff left, the ice started making some noise as the temperature warmed heading for -3 the weather network said. I heard a good deep crack way off in the distance and then another one much, much, much closer. Within six feet of my hole to be precise.    A small crack showed up with water coming out of it. It was pretty cool. About 15 minutes after that another good crack sounded and I felt the ice lurch a couple inches under my feet. It definitely surprised me but my underwear remained free of stains. Then a short while later the ice jumped another few inches under my feet again. After the cold temperatures the warming spell had the ice gods all upset I think. Here I was sacrificing some perch, but they weren’t happy.    I landed a few more and headed in 1ish. The 4 inch pressure crack had defiantly gotten wider in some areas, and pushed together in others. It was neat to be out their when it was shifting like that. I didn’t feel nervous at all after the initial crack.      I got home and headed up to Peterborough to resume my schooling that night.  I had a really good time over the Christmas break, landing my PB brookie, and catching my first whitie. I love to catch perch so that was welcome as well. Socializing with good friends, and bush whacking into back lakes is always a riot. I was home for about 20 days over X-mas, spent 6 days ice fishing, and 5 of those days were in a row. I wish I could keep at it. Hopefully I’ll be out on the old Scugog soon, looking for some walleye and crappie. This weekend maybe.  Hope all of you had a good Christmas as well and this report didn’t drag on too long for you.  Tight Lines -R-  "

288730,NAC,2009-01-07 01:22:00,369,"killer report Ramble On!  I was in Haliburton from Dec 26-29 with the intent of doing similar to you in Bancroft.  After seeing it rain non-stop for the first three days, I called it off and headed back to Waterloo.  Apparently I made a mistake. You have now renewed my quest to go back and try for some specks and/or splake. Thanks for pointing out the snow depth, I'll bring snowshoes for sure."
288734,solopaddler,2009-01-07 01:27:00,8605,Ahhh to be young and full of p!$$ and vinegar. You're a good lad.
288737,troutologist,2009-01-07 01:34:00,951,Good report for sure. Its trips like that on which you learn and earn your fish. it does however make successive trips go much smoother.  I unfortunately never learn and would rather go the wrong/most difficult way fast than the easy way methodically.  sweet fontinalis

288810,Northhunter,2009-01-07 03:09:00,214,"Awesome report!  I've been on a few trips like that  Took (well, tried to take) a buddy into a secluded beaver pond for an early goose hunt one year. It was supposed to be a 10-15 minute walk. We weaved, broke, thrashed through and cursed at the bush for over an hour. At one point we even had geese flying over us above the trees in an ash swamp, so we knew we at least got close. We never found the pond.  Myself and two buddies picked out a secluded pothole lake using stocking lists and maps a few years ago. It was supposedly stocked with brookies and rainbows. We drove in as far as we could, then broke in on foot. Waist deep snow. We finally get to the lake and it looks awesome. The sun isn't quite up yet but the sky is clear and it's calm. It was the perfect morning until we started punching holes. In every hole we drill we got coffee-stained water and bits of the mud bottom, which smelled like $#!!. It wasn't much of a lake.  We packed up, hiked out (through the same waist deep snow - not 20mins later) and hit another new lake we had been looking at. The ""lake"" was so small I had a line on the opposite shore. We sat there all day. Nothing. Then as the sun started to dip and we were thinking about picking up, the flag on my farthest tip-up shot up. I never adjusted the rig. It had the same minnow on it for about 5 hours and counting, and he was still kicking strong on a drop-shot rig until a 3 1/2lb speck ate'em up"
