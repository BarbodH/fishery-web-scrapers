290080,Joey,2009-01-09 23:23:00,9122,Those are awesome photo's Bernie.  I love looking at the clothes and everything in the background.  All the empties on the picnic table in the first pic reminds me of my family cottage pics from back when!!  Great stuff.  Joey

290117,Bernie,2009-01-10 00:59:00,3190,Hey Wayne. Wonder if the labor inspector was around when they did this?    This moment was a big step forward in our communities history.    Nipissing was a bustling town a century ago. Not much remains anymore.  
290124,Terry,2009-01-10 01:28:00,14456,"yeah love old photos   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=old1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/old1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
290134,Bernie,2009-01-10 01:39:00,3190,Wowee Terry. You sure cleaned that photo up. Nicely done. Thank you. I guess if I am going to collect some of this old stuff it may be worthwhile to get a program to do repairs.  PS.. The young girl is my fathers mother.
290320,Krisco,2009-01-10 16:29:00,67,"Great Job Bernie,  It is great to see pictures from the past, I wish my father - inlaw was still with us as he would be very interested in the hockey pics as he played in Powassan back in the 50's. As a matter of fact we have an old jersey (sweater material actually) that he past on to his grandson before he passed on, we still have some family up that way."
290325,Terry,2009-01-10 16:54:00,14456,"the programs are not that hard to use   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=speed.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/speed.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"

Awesome pics, thanks for the share!   :clapping:  Hey, those guys in that pic are the ancestors of OFNers! It gives me goosebumps. Truly amazing"

290346,johnnyb,2009-01-10 19:23:00,3413,"Really amazing, Bernie -- I had the pleasure of working at a lodge on the South Shore one summer...I got to keep all the Giesler boats cleaned and gassed and shuffled for new clients.  In the spring when we were getting them ready, I noticed the signature under the bench and asked my boss ""Why did Bert Reynolds sign this boat? -- And why is his name spelled wrong?"""
290350,bucktail,2009-01-10 19:28:00,1857,VERY COOL!!!!!
290354,lew,2009-01-10 19:40:00,12767,"Outstanding pictures Bernie, and like others have said, it's great to look back on these old memories. Hopefully you'll share more of them with us.  Being as you come from a long line of cedarstrip boat builders I thought you may be interested in this one, although I've posted it before and you may have already seen it.  This is my Dad trolling in his 15' cedarstrip back about 1955 and it's interesting to note that the steering wheel is on the left side of the boat rather than the right side as they are today, and also is situated in the rear seat rather than the front, but I recall many of the old cedarstrips from that era were configured the same way.  The old gear shift is quite different from today also with the 2 levers rather than a single....one for shifting from fwd-rev-neutral and the other is the throttle. It also gives a good view of the old cable/pulley systen for the steering hook-up.  That 25 HP Johnson was actually green but somehow came out brown when the picture was colorized.  Things have sure come along ways in 50 odd years.  And BTW, that fishing pole Dad's using is the very pole I learned to fish with  "
290400,Bernie,2009-01-10 21:13:00,3190, A great fellow named Bert Rennette worked at the boat shop for many years. He has retired several years ago.
290404,Bernie,2009-01-10 21:21:00,3190, Lew that is a great picture! I have seen it once before here but it has been a couple of years ago. Early boats had the steering to the left and for some reason switched to right. Possibly to offset prop torque. The old outboards sure had their good points. Durable and quality manufactured. But today's motors also are well made and much easier on fuel. Dad would never let me use his fishing rod! Ha!
290412,Terry,2009-01-10 21:33:00,14456,hey I remember that photo nice
290435,Dano,2009-01-10 22:29:00,719,"Hey Bernie, this is awesome stuff, love the pics and your insights into them, very entertaining. It must feel wonderful to have those memories preserved and some actual roots you can relate to so well. Thank you, one of my favourite posts yet."
290505,Bernie,2009-01-11 00:57:00,3190,Dano thank you for your kind words. Glad you enjoy them. This is the last couple from this bagful of photos. Time to go and dig out some more. Some may recognize this body of water but it sure doesn't look like this now on the land. Callander Bay about 5 decades ago or more.   Don't know who these fellows are but it shows the styles and the car of the day.   This was taken on a farm in Trout Creek by my dad.   This is a group of my dads brothers and friends duck hunting on an island near Spanish. Note the beer case.   That's all for a couple days. If anyone would like to add to the post please feel free to do so!
290506,ccmtcanada,2009-01-11 01:02:00,7971,"Great photos...it inspired me actually!  I drove to my mom's place this morning to pick up old photo albums, so I'll be scanning them soon and posting a few as well.  Thanks for getting me off my butt...I've been wanting to do this for a while now."
287747,Bernie,2009-01-04 21:22:00,3190,"Going through some pictures from the past, scanning and saving. Came across some from dads collection of thousands. Thought you may like to see. This is in front of what is now my place in August 1958.   Three of my dads good friends circa 1967 on thier annual fishing trip to the French River. They still do this.   This is, I am guessing from the 1940's.   This is my Mom. She is like Snow White. LOL. Really she loves everything.Feeds everything, even me once in a while. Ha Ha Ha !!!!   This is my Dad, must be around 1950. Youngest of the bunch of Gieslers. Great man!   This is the Giesler Boat works crew from around 1947-49? Great photo. My dad on the left. "
287748,Terry,2009-01-04 21:26:00,14456,great old photos

287767,Radnine,2009-01-04 22:22:00,1538,Fantastic! I loved those pictures. And you are a lucky man for being a part of a legacy like that. Thanks for taking the time to post. Jim

287772,Leecher,2009-01-04 22:42:00,7832,A blast from the past Thank you Bernie for putting it together and sharing it with us Jacques
287775,Gerritt,2009-01-04 22:49:00,6129,Bernie.. Awesome old photos! Man your mom was a looker! and your right... she loves everything and is sweeter then sugar!... your dad was quite the strapping young buck back in the day! Two nicer people I have not met in some time. Your family has quite the history in the near north.. something you should be proud of and cherish!  Thanks for sharing with us.  G
287781,Bernie,2009-01-04 22:56:00,3190,"Thanks guys. Yes I am fortunate. And I am thankful. These photos are just a couple of the hundred or so I scanned today. There are likely a few thousand more. Lots of work to put them into digital. My dad was an avid amatuer photograher years ago. He did wedding photos but hated it. He preferred other stuff. Had some very good equipment in his darkroom. Still has a lot of it. All kinds of picture formats too. The most intriguing ones are stereo slides. The camera had two lens's and exposed the negative twice. When developed and put into a dual slide and viewed it was 3D. I love to look at them, almost as if you are there. It's these kind of pictures that I really like. Old times-good times. "
287803,ccmtcanada,2009-01-04 23:55:00,7971,Wow Bernie!  These are awesome pictures...my mom has a bunch of photos that I want to get scanned as well...amazing looking at them...thanks for that blast into your past!
287806,holdfast,2009-01-05 00:00:00,1813,Luv the Ole Black and Whites.  I wonder if your Dad finds the fishing better now or then?
287807,Greencoachdog,2009-01-05 00:00:00,8163,Excellent photos Bern!!!  You can post more any time you feel like it in my opinion!!!  A very good lookin' family... what happened to you???     Try not to be such an Arsenic   Brian!
287823,jediangler,2009-01-05 00:20:00,1923,"Great pics, and a view into the past of the sport we all love. Thanks for posting."
287826,BUSTER,2009-01-05 00:26:00,1336,"more,more"
287848,Bernie,2009-01-05 00:57:00,3190," Cliff I just used my home scanner for these. They are pretty versatile. But some of the prints dad made are huge and won't fit the scanner. They are suitable for framing and will get done.  Holdfast the fishing now pales in comparason to what it once was.  Ha, not sure Coach. Redundant genes I guess. These were my great grandparents. Maybe from them?   This is my Uncle Joe carving up the next boat part. Sometime in the 1940's it appears. He still does this to this day (on the same band saw). He is in his 80's "
287875,Bly,2009-01-05 01:52:00,1556,"Wonderful Bernie!  Over the past few weeks I have been tracing and attempting to complete a proper family history.   I have most of the names, dates and details and over the holiday my grandmother was able to provide with photos.  I have spent several hours working with them and have many more to do.  There was also an envelope containing very old negatives.   My scanner will turn negs into photos, cannot wait to see what and who they are.   Managed to scan at least a few that date back to 1886 or so.  Thanks for sharing your pictures Bernie and enjoy the history that comes with them!!"
287922,irishfield,2009-01-05 05:10:00,26272,Great stuff Bernie !!!! Now with a mother so Beautiful... what happened with you Bud ?
287927,jwl,2009-01-05 05:34:00,1056,"I love those kind of old photos, I always look at them and think about how much different some things where back then ,specially ones that really capture the era like the one with your Great-Grandfolks in it"
287928,smbhunter,2009-01-05 05:43:00,186,Great photos. Thanks for sharing.
289838,Moosebunk,2009-01-09 04:29:00,3970,Bernie... thanks for this thread.  This kinda stuff is so cool.
289843,snag,2009-01-09 04:34:00,1932,Brings back memories of my parents pics.  Please post more.  That applies to anyone.  It's OUR heritage.
289847,TJQ,2009-01-09 04:41:00,7806,Bernie... wow man really thanks for sharing those are awesome pictures!!
289855,Bernie,2009-01-09 05:04:00,3190,"Thank you for the comments, glad you enjoy them. Busy putting together pictures from the past on my hometown and it has proven educational to me. Not a lot that would be interesting here though. As the pictures that relate to the environment here come up I will post them from time to time. Dad has 2 thousand slides alone. And prints and movies it will take a year or two to get it all digital. Here are a couple more oldies. The hunt camp my grandpa bought way back. This looks like it was taken just before they built the one we use now in 1960.   This was taken in the old arena in Powassan sometime in the 1950's. I know these guys. A couple of them are still around here.   This is Wades Landing early 1950's. "
289885,blaque,2009-01-09 13:06:00,2419,"WOW, i live 8 hours away, and have only been to lake Nippissing once (a couple years back at promise land) and i recognize that pic.....we launched there. THats pretty neat. (at least i think thats where that is lol)"
