289630,canadian_copper,2009-01-08 22:43:00,925,JUST WENT ON AND THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE A TROJAN TRYING TO JACK MY SYSTEM!! SO EVERYONE STILL BEWARE!!!!
289641,irishfield,2009-01-08 22:53:00,26272,Maybe it's a sign Scott... no need to go there !
289723,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-09 01:10:00,10439,"Scott They're shutting it down for ""Routine"" maintenance this weekend."
289732,solopaddler,2009-01-09 01:23:00,8605, I told you last night stop logging onto strippersonline. Do that and we should all be safe.
289738,drwxr,2009-01-09 01:36:00,453,"its weird, i use opera and have avg, but never get any errors..."
289739,forrest,2009-01-09 01:36:00,1032,"OFC category? Float fishing.  That site has been screwed up for weeks and the admins have done nothing to protect their users.  Nice.  Real nice.  I guess I am ticked because I wasted 20 minutes trying to register on the site, sent the admin an email and got no response.  Anyone listening?   forrest"
289759,douG,2009-01-09 02:14:00,2693,I think that the message is clear here.  Hear?
289772,forrest,2009-01-09 02:30:00,1032," People listen here.....but at FF.net?  I could not imagine that happening here.  The site is too well supported and has concern for the people who visit.  forrest PS: I will still be able to register there, won't I?"
289796,ironstone74,2009-01-09 03:09:00,201, C'mon man it's a great site!  It's a smaller operation so things take a bit more time.  If you need support logging in... I think you can wait a little longer to get hooked up there  Paul
289797,Raf,2009-01-09 03:11:00,3495,i thought that was a site for obese people
289955,Pinch,2009-01-09 16:43:00,231, Lol very good!!!
289961,Paulus,2009-01-09 17:02:00,522," Shoot me the url, will ya?    Oh wait! I thought it was STRIPERS, as in Striped bass.  Never mind.   p.-"
289972,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2009-01-09 17:52:00,160,"  Yes I've heard great things about the site.. and I went and registered myself in October 08.. still cant log in, e-mailed twice to admin, no reply.. I thought it mihgt have something to do with my registered handle ""Brownfisher"".. regardless still waiting....maybe Paul could talk to the right people......."
289978,ccmtcanada,2009-01-09 18:38:00,7971,I've had similar experiences trying to sign up.  Registered...waited for confirmation email.  It never arrived.  Emailed the admin 4 times and gave up after no response.  Oh well...
289981,solopaddler,2009-01-09 18:42:00,8605,"  Trust me you're not alone. My friend owns the site (which is the only reason I frequent it), and not being very computer savvy, had left the maintenance of the site in someone elses hands. This guy has done nothing for months.... Everything is in shambles including the registration of new members. Sit tight, hopefully things will be fixed."
289984,dannyboy,2009-01-09 19:00:00,367,I can log on but then my spyware and virus detector give me warnings. Might be best to stay away until things are sorted out.  Dan
290408,CLofchik,2009-01-10 21:26:00,854,"It was a great site when Roque first started it and fishing steel was still a niche, but I gave up on it when my post was deleted and I was pm'd a warning because I didn't blur the background on a few fish pics."
290446,pigeonfisher,2009-01-10 22:55:00,696,"    Hey,  I resemble that!"
