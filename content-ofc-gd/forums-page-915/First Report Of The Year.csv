Last year was non-stop action all day long but not this year.  The bite was very slow, and from the other reports we weren't the only ones with idle lines.  it took us about 20 minutes to land our first fish of the trip and i was thinking.....Gonna be Good  and besides the odd perch it was dead until sunset.  At approx. 5:30 we managed to get our first walleye of the trip.  We were up nice and early on Tuesday enjoying some coffee and sweetener(aka Irish Cream) and setting lines.  Hopes were high as the sun rose but the bite still wasn't great.  I managed to lose one and land the biggest of the trip and thats it!  We headed to a nearby reef for the sunset bite which turned out to be a great idea.  Four of us managed to land 4 walleye and lose 2 in about a 45 minute window.  And one of our group managed to lose his nice new rod/reel to something that left with it in a hurry.....I felt bad but couldn't help laughing a bit.  I've heard of that happening but never witnessed it for myself.  We planned on hitting the same reef Wednesday morning for our last fish before leaving but the weather just didn't co-operate.  It was quite windy, snowing pretty good and having no protection from the elements we decided to pass.  The slow fishing aside, it was a great time.  It's good to be back and spending time with my Dad was awsome!!!   My Dad  Me with one of the fish caught on the reef  Group shot  Mitchell wiht another reef fish  My Dad and I  Trying out the new auger.....nice  Sorry about the links......couldn't get the pics to work."
