290054,camillj,2009-01-09 22:33:00,1988,I ran off and ordered a pair of the LLBean Pull on Wading boots with the Aqua Stealth soles and a single velcro strap ... really NICE boots ... but like an idiot I ordered them in my size (11) ... which fit great ... as long as I am not wearing my waders ... should have ordered size (13)  If any worthy OFC'er could make use of them they are gone to the first $50 offer (with pickup) .... otherwise I am thinking we have an early donation for the next charity auction  PM me quick before I change my mind  They should be perfect if you are normally size 9 (or 8)
