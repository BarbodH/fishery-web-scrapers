289975,PatrickGG,2009-01-09 18:11:00,562,How about a section that specifically relates to trolling? i know a few that can share tips on how to be better trollers
289616,Rich,2009-01-08 22:14:00,3927,"""best of"" would be cool, if there's any way to regulate it. Some sort of button you have to hit on a report perhaps.. where if it makes that certain number of button pushes it gets into the best of forum. I dunno, just shootin' ideas."
289650,steve_paul,2009-01-08 23:17:00,658,"On the old board, I think I remember being able to ""subscribe"" or bookmark certain threads and find them easily on your profile.  Rather than another board category, could this feature be added?  Saves having to develop all sorts of convuluted criteria for what makes a ""best of"" report"
289653,irishfield,2009-01-08 23:21:00,26272,"I'm content just hitting ""view new posts"" !!"
289658,misfish,2009-01-08 23:44:00,29133,"    Can we have a guy with a shotgun,crossbow,camera,dingalings? We have a guy with a rod and reel after all.  I do believe I was told this once,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SUCK IT UP BUTTER CUP."
289664,BUSTER,2009-01-09 00:01:00,1336,"my trucks running great,  think ill take it apart and see if i can make it run better"
289700,fishindevil,2009-01-09 00:45:00,6254,"Well i think bernie & irishfield both said it right !!!! i dont have a problem with having a few improvements,whatever works for the members !!!!"
289705,holdfast,2009-01-09 00:50:00,1813,"  Good description as I couldn't agree anymore.  Like other members stated leave it the way it is.  Why ruin a good thing. Now they want Board members to judge threads.  Geez its cl icky enough as it is.   Think about it.  Yea and who's going to choose the judges.  Leave this Board alone.  If you ask me, if we need a separate section.  There should be a Kiddy section so I know I'm conversing with adults or vice verse"
289716,JerseyDog,2009-01-09 01:04:00,190,"maybe there is a way in the software to have three folders - one that is the general discussion which has all the posts just like it is now.  one folder that has only the NF posts and one forum that has the posts that are not designated NF (so presumably a fishing post)  that way, the folks who like the GENERAL DISCUSSION (like me) could go to that folder, the folks who are interested in the fishing post could go to the FISHING folder (which sorts out the NF threads) and the NF folder (which sorts out the NF threads).  same threads, just sorted differenltly for different tastes."

289720,solopaddler,2009-01-09 01:07:00,8605,  I don't think a single person has stated they want the format of the board to change. Obviously it's good as is.  What's been mentioned would be an addition to the already existing sub-boards.
289726,holdfast,2009-01-09 01:13:00,1813,"I think what your going to see is OFNers Branching in different Directions.  May work for some, but I like going to work then when I have time checking out the Board.  One spot I go to and that's the General Discussion which usually I have a lot of threads to go through.  Knives, Cars, Bass, Carp, Fishing Report, Yea I need to Know something about Stereos.  The Carp Poster has my answer.  Cool.  That's what I like about a collective forum vice a selective forum."
289729,danbo,2009-01-09 01:18:00,2646,You can also go into your Controls & use your IGNORE list & add the names of people you cannot relate to. This cuts down on angry flame wars..sorta..
289734,johnnyb,2009-01-09 01:29:00,3413,"Saw the title a couple days ago, and ignored the thread.  Checking in now to see where it's at after 4 pages.  Seems like the usual response....the all-topics-welcome General Discussion really is what makes this site unique.  All the great folks on it make exceptional.  All the jerks keep us coming back for more    Kidding.... Just to throw my $0.02 on the pile...if you want a board that has different forums within it, we won't hold it against you if you post over there too"
289741,holdfast,2009-01-09 01:39:00,1813,"  If you mean under the Sub Forum.  AS long as I don't have to read every body's two cent judgements on yours and a few other standalone excellent threads on the Discussion Forum which would be where the thread would originate from I suspect before going to the Sub forum. LOL  Im Jealous, Yea, my fishing Pics are Garbage compared to yours when I do manage to get some pics out.   I nominate you as judge! Can I pay you off?  Hey that gives me a good Idea.  Me judging a --------Lady Byng OFNer"
289744,forrest,2009-01-09 01:45:00,1032,OK...one more category.  Float fishing.
289757,douG,2009-01-09 02:05:00,2693,"I'm SO HAPPY that we now have this topic out of the way, beaten to a thin pulp.  Why do you hate OFC so much so that you can't breathe and also promote Communism also as well."

289779,Terry,2009-01-09 02:38:00,14456,I think we need a new  category for   FF.NET USERS

289793,forrest,2009-01-09 03:06:00,1032," See Terry is all for it.  I do not hear anyone seconding GCDs ""My Bleeding Hermorrhoids"" ad on.  GCD I dunno about you.  Why would you use your Hermorrhoids for fishing.  I think that would hurt.  I pray you are not thinking of making a sequel to that Bass video: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=27337 because that would hurt all of us  forrest"
289833,Moosebunk,2009-01-09 04:25:00,3970,I like what Buster said a page back.   and to add something.... more people could use the BLOG's here to archive the links to their reports or reports they like.  Less digging for everyone.
289898,desship,2009-01-09 13:37:00,96,How about a new section on ask youre CO or MNR. The Thunder Bay Board has this and you can ask the MNR about regulations and they post charges that ended up in court.  :)
289974,packrat,2009-01-09 17:59:00,93,  Good one Joey
288955,chilli,2009-01-07 15:43:00,199,"If OFC doesn't want the additional traffic leave it the way it is.  It's not like the guys who go directly to the general section will be affected. They'll still go directly to the general section.  The attitude of ""love it or leave it"" and ""here we go again"" is unfortunate here. There are the regulars who are too eager to come down on any new ideas or not so regulars. That is why I'm a not so regular.  Subtract all the unnecessary negativism from this thread and it would have disappeared within an hour. Good Idea but I don't know why I wasted 10 minutes of my life reading the whole thing."
288987,bigugli,2009-01-07 16:47:00,6138,TJ:  I like the idea of a memorial section/wall. maybe with a typical photo of the person at their best. A simple photograph of an old friend can often kindle the most vivid memories.
289006,Victor,2009-01-07 17:19:00,1609,"carped  i also like the idea of the ""best of"" section, if it's just links to the actual post, it shouldn't take up too much server space.""  EDIT hey that's not fair TJ!! lol ... after seeing TJ type ""b1 tched"" i decided to try it on my own... and i ended up gettin... ""carped"" ... lol !"
289008,TennesseeGuy,2009-01-07 17:26:00,957,As a guest on this message board I'll not be making any unsolicited suggestions to those who are working hard to make it function.
289010,jonnybass,2009-01-07 17:30:00,346,I agree with everyone else. I like the idea of having a section for the really good reports.
289031,Pachone,2009-01-07 17:55:00,276,Sounds like a great Idea to me! i find myself digging through to find some moosebunk or solo threads! as well as many other interesting ones.
289052,douG,2009-01-07 18:29:00,2693,"I agree with Chili - even though we will not be changing the board format anytime soon ( I hope!), we need to learn to accept well-meaning suggestions for improvement without accusations of hate. That with us  / agin us attitude is wrong minded."

289095,solopaddler,2009-01-07 19:50:00,8605," Sorry, but I respectfully disagree. As a member of this board or community if you will, I don't consider myself a guest. Being an active member of this community I see nothing wrong at all with expressing an idea that I truly believe is a good one."
289103,Headhunter,2009-01-07 20:04:00,5703,"Solo, I see your point. I don't agree 100%, but I find that I don't agree 100% with most people, most of the time. HH"
289106,xeon,2009-01-07 20:09:00,350,"Everyone has different ways of organizing things.  But a ""Best of"" section would be nice, but a pain to sort through 1000's of threads."
289131,TJQ,2009-01-07 20:49:00,7806,"Hmm  OK..  Ill start a discussion with the mods..  ...  heres a question for you... how do we decide whats a ""best of""???  How do I answer the PMs that say... ""well you made so and so's post a best of why not mine???""  Any criterea we should use...  cause if its just up to the mods, we would get nothing but grief..."
289140,solopaddler,2009-01-07 20:56:00,8605," That's a toughie for sure LOL! (never said the concept was perfect  )  Obvious criteria would be # of views and/or replys. Also ones that occur in more exotic locales, something beyond the norm."
289141,Sinker,2009-01-07 20:58:00,8692,"If your going to make a new section, it should just be called fishing reports. Only reports (with pics  ) allowed.  I kinda like it the way it is, but a reports section would be a welcomed new addition.  Sinker"
289143,bassjnkie,2009-01-07 20:59:00,1101,"It is a hard decision to pick the best of. But just a suggesion, detail in words and pic detail (went to the BOG caught walleye, here's a pic, that's not really a best of, Solo's reports, Rich's reports, examples of best of),, greatest how to's (the reel cleaning thread comes to mind and the jig tying), and etc...  Again just a suggestion,"
289148,Raf,2009-01-07 21:05:00,3495," to quote the infamous fidgeonpisher, ""dang, beer, wings, elitism!"""
289150,xeon,2009-01-07 21:09:00,350,"Probably the best way would be to have a select few oldtimers who volunteer to pick and choose a list, then make a stickey at the top where users can post links or the thread number to the ones they like.  Best way to do it would be to give the power to the members."
289360,jonnybass,2009-01-08 02:21:00,346," I second this idea. This way I can go straight to the good stuff, reports with pics! That's what I most enjoy reading and why I first came here. No offense to the community, I do occasionally enjoy chatting about NF, but 99% of the time I want to read fishing reports, so it would be nice to have it all in one place that I can go straight to.  That would be amazing.  Excellent idea Sinker!"
289372,Bernie,2009-01-08 02:34:00,3190,I don't care for other sites. Here it's like being in a crowd of people all the time with interesting coversation going on. Other sites its like you are in a huge building and you have to go look door to door for something interesting. They also seem too impersonal. When you are out for a day with the guys fishing you don't talk fishing all day do you?
289384,rickster,2009-01-08 02:52:00,495,  I think that falls under sadness  or maybe humor    no  no      Learning from past failures   ya thats it
289385,rickster,2009-01-08 02:53:00,495,  couldn't agree more
289396,jonnybass,2009-01-08 03:19:00,346, :clapping:  all of the above
289397,ehg,2009-01-08 03:21:00,2666,"Separation of the main 'general discussion' section into fishing, non-fishing, 'best of', 'in memoriam' etc.... Goes against what makes this board successful and active.  Isn't there already a bunch of sub-forums, ...classifieds, members directory, hook-ups, fishing news, photography, etc.... "
289412,PatrickGG,2009-01-08 03:43:00,562,"This site is good the way it is, but i have a great idea! I don't know if you guys ever heard of Unique Reps? Basically when good advice is given or anything of that nature the person gives you a Rep point which can be good for picking and choosing opinions and decisions or help when trying to resolve issues with anything from fishing to hunting, I've seen this system on other Web Sites that i frequent."
289415,rickster,2009-01-08 03:46:00,495,    There's other websites??????????
288452,carp-starter,2009-01-06 16:47:00,253,"I have thought about a new OFC category for some time because of what I have seen and read on OFC Community. Just in the last 3 or 4 days, there have been more than a few threads that have been posted in the “General Discussion” on OFC. It would have been more appropriate to have put these thread in this new special category where people could share their thoughts, give support and post their special requests.  About 3 weeks ago on South East Fly Fishing Forum, I saw for the first time what they had and they had what I have been thinking about. I check out South East only because of their fly tying category and so I did not know about this one category that they had.  Below is the URL of the index for the South East Fly Fishing Forum and the 2nd URL is the category that OFC should have. I think that there is a need for the category. The creation of such a category will depend on Admin and the other members of the OFC Community.  I believe that the category is self explanatory as to what it is for.  Thank you – carp-starter  Main Index Page http://www.southeastflyfishingforum.com/forum/  The Land of Healing Waters http://www.southeastflyfishingforum.com/fo...waters-f56.html  Do we need such category? Opinions????"
288453,danbo,2009-01-06 16:51:00,2646,OFC..LUV it or Leave it..  (All we really need is a couple of Bouncers & a Community Phsyciatrist/Bishop/Rabbi/..)
288456,HTHM,2009-01-06 16:57:00,4082,Asking for support is a general discussion type of thing. It is the OFC community
288459,capt bruce,2009-01-06 17:04:00,820,"Same thing happens this time of year every year , someone wants to fix what aint broke . Im sure you mean well but"

288473,Raf,2009-01-06 17:49:00,3495,hjow about we have an off topic forum where people can talk about fishing?
288474,irishfield,2009-01-06 17:51:00,26272,  
288475,Clampet,2009-01-06 17:52:00,1947," Fi, fi , fishing?"
288494,tjsa,2009-01-06 18:51:00,1578," If that option works for that site, fantastic!!!!  However, if that was a forum here, I would probably have missed FishnNAutographs post about his daughter for over a day, and I think that is not acceptable.  I go directly to the general discussion area, and rarely go to the other sections. That is why it is called the ""General Discussion"" forum, where you can: ""Talk about fishing, hunting, the great outdoors or whatever you like in here! Keep it clean!""  This is the place we can post ANYTHING, from fishing/hunting reports, ask questions from anything like plumbing to lawn care, ask for, and respond to requests of support in times of need. Its up front and in our face, and it works. I am a recent recipient  of support, well wishes, prayers, and quite a few pm's from members here.  No disrespect, my opinion is we do not need it."
288497,Cookslav,2009-01-06 18:58:00,1457,I like it the way it is...guess that why I keep comming back just my 2 cents
288502,solopaddler,2009-01-06 19:15:00,8605,"I agree with the sentiments expressed. I still think my idea which I asked about awhile back is a good one though  . A ""Best of OFC"" archive section for the very best trip reports. There's been many, many outstanding reports posted over the years that get lost in the shuffle...."
288503,HTHM,2009-01-06 19:18:00,4082,"That is worth a good long thought.....Mind you, most of your reports would be in it. (I mean that as a compliment, not a slag)"
288531,highdrifter,2009-01-06 20:28:00,2534, I agree with that... Good threads get pushed back into oblivion way too fast.  What if I were away for a coupla weeks and missed a Bunk or solo report.... OH THE HUMANITY!!  This could be could be good... A little change wouldn't be that big of a deal.  HD
288562,SlowPoke,2009-01-06 21:10:00,2984," Hmmm, not a bad idea. I'm normally in the ""we don't need more topics"" camp but this is the best arguement I've heard for a new one. There are so many good reports; it would be tough to settle on parameters/qualifications but it's worth consideration.  -Brian"
288711,HTHM,2009-01-07 00:51:00,4082,"I would suggest that if possible, we do a ""best of"" button on the bottom of the thread segments. Similar to Craigslist. Just a thought."

288900,TJQ,2009-01-07 13:59:00,7806,"I don't think anyone looked at the link..  Its a good idea as far as im concerned, at least part of it.  An ""In Memory of.."" section is in the works..  As for the posts for thoughts and prayers, I will, as long as Im here, try my dambdest to keep as much in the general discussion forum as humanly possible.. I've carped and moaned (ask the other mods) about every subsection there is.. lol.. If it was all up to me, and I didnt listen to anyone, (I value everyones input) there would only be ONE forum.  But thats my opinion.  I do now that if we split the board into fishing and off topic posts, it would completely change the character of the community.  It is amazing that we have been here long enough to have a ""Retired Fishermen"" section..."
288920,JerseyDog,2009-01-07 14:58:00,190,"I think it really depends on how fishing impacts your life. Think about it:  If the thread is about your lawnmower and how to sharpen the blade, its really just a thread about how to get your lawn mowed faster so you can go fishing.  If its a thread about gas prices, its really just a fishing thread about how to make sure you can afford gas to get out to your fishing hole.  If its a thread about your friend's and family's and their health, its b/c time at the hospital or worse really takes away from time spent fishing, not to mention sadness makes fishing a lot less enjoyable.  If its a thread about quitting smoking, its because money saved from smokes buys tackle and fuel and maybe a fly-in trip somewhere.  If its a thread about your water heater bursting, its b/c you cant go fishing if you basement is filled with three feet of water.  If its a thread about a big buck, well thats simply about having some freezer food handy, so you can get dinner over quick and back out onto the lake for a few more casts before the sun goes down.  The reality is, life dramas big and small all relate to fishing in someway or another."
288931,jonnybass,2009-01-07 15:09:00,346,What if it's a thread about the Leafs?
