Looking for an ice report for the east end off of ball point. I'd like to head out Saturday afternoon on the sled. Any information re: ice conditions, safe travel to the deep holes etc would be much appreciated.  south"

289928,South,2009-01-09 15:04:00,2,"Thanks eyefish...  Here is what I'm hearing for the North East end.  -----------  ""In a nutshell, the ice is great now. No more open water, 10-12"" everywhere. Get out and do some icefishing!!""  ""The open water north of ball point and out from St. Christophers is all iced over now. 9-10"" at sandbar, viewlake as well. No issues what so ever over here, smooth sailing!""  ""Once you get to Ball point stay near shore till you get straight across from Birch Island then cross the lake to Viewlake. There's a bit of a pressure crack off ball point so take it slow but besides that it's smooth sailing.""  Be safe"
