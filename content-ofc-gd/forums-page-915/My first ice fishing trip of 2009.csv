287252,Ron,2009-01-03 14:55:00,1683,"Good to see you guys again. Short lived though as we decided to move to another area. Seemed like the fish were there, only they weren't interseted in biting. On our other spot I managed to put 1 laker, 2 white fish, 1 walleye and a rock bass on the ice. We stayed out for the night bite but only got one more whitie."
287258,misfish,2009-01-03 15:12:00,29133,"Nice report guys.   Wayne didnt I say something about that truck the other day. Should of took the FORD,even with the cracked manifold..LOL  Good show boys."

287306,wuchikubo,2009-01-03 17:56:00,1114,"Great report Wayne, looking forward to another with some of your fish in there too."
287632,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-04 14:41:00,1362,Nice report Wayne...at least you were able to get out and get the lines wet!!!....I'm finally headin out on the  river this afternoon for some Walleye action.....Is your portable a Frabill and is it the 2 man??
287915,irishfield,2009-01-05 04:41:00,26272,Yes.. see them two seats Steve! LOL... Frabil Trecker.
287952,corvette1,2009-01-05 13:24:00,1765,congrats on the whites & eyes is the dealer going to replace the wheel bolts
287961,TJQ,2009-01-05 13:33:00,7806,"Great Report Wayne, ,, interesting to see the sonar work!"
287975,irishfield,2009-01-05 14:10:00,26272," Corvette.. dropped off my dead Ford and got a loaner from them... then drove to the Chev dealer in it and dropped the lug bolts on the managers desk and he said ""I already have your truck booked for 9am tomorrow as we don't have any lug bolts in stock for today"". If your wheel is damaged we'll get you a new one of those as well....  So hopefully I'll have my trucks back by Wednesday... and then we can take a serious look at my wife's truck that's doing some ""complaining"" as well.  Hasn't been a good week."
288567,irishfield,2009-01-06 21:25:00,26272,Hey Terry !!! Guess what??? TWO out of the three remaining studs BROKE when they went to remove the wheel this morning.  Now you were with me when my F150 broke... then my Sierra... you'd better bring your own sled for the next trip as you're not riding on mine!!!!
288577,Terry,2009-01-06 21:50:00,14456,but would you rather have your family with you when a wheel comes off  going down the roador truck breaks down in the middle of no where freezing cold or me which would you rather risk
288579,irishfield,2009-01-06 21:52:00,26272,"Yah.. okay, you can be my crash test dummy !!!"
288895,corvette1,2009-01-07 13:42:00,1765,thats good news wayne hope it all works out
289841,snag,2009-01-09 04:33:00,1932,"That was great IF.  I've had my nuts sheared off figuratively and literally too. Thought I had a flat, and then the realization hit me like the bill!  Some very nice food you landed!  "
289942,Kirk,2009-01-09 15:45:00,347,"Nice report Wayne  Maybe I'm getting old and lazy, but I won't ask for GPS waypoints or names of lakes, or look for tree lines in the background that I recognize.  All I really want to know is where are the fillets and what time is dinner LOL  Kirk"
287152,irishfield,2009-01-03 02:27:00,26272,"Terry was buggin me to get out ice fishing this week and I told him I wasn't overly keen on hauling out onto simcoe for Perch. Would like to get into some Lakers or Whitefish, but then again nether of us wanted to drive to my place up in Temagami.    Lucky for us I'd slapped a GPS tracking device onto Fishhunters (Lloyd's) Van back in November after hauling his charter boat home from BOQ. Terry and I sat patiently this morning and waited to see Lloyd's vehicle head North.. and we followed in hot pursuit!  Arrived at Lloyd's ""peace of tranquility"" around 8:30 am..... got our gear together and hauled it out onto the lake. Found Lloyd and as luck would have it we also got to see our good friends Ron and Keith, as well as Keith's son Dale and MNR biologist Jason.  Drilled a few holes and got all set up. My first time to try out my new shelter that I got late last season from the CTC 50% off sale. I can tell you... I'll never sit outside again.. LOL    Terry.. diehard in his chair!    Keith with a nice Pickeral... well other than it had a bad case of AD. Not sure what it had.. tumour or just a ""bowel"" blockage.    Shot of my finder for those wondering how clear a ""boat"" unit works. Top line with spike is a Salmo Chubby darter. Next straight line down near bottom is a 1/16th oz jig. Two lines below that are uncooperative fish ! Dashed line on an angle... ? moving fish or annomolies.    Keith with a nice Whitie    Keith with another Whitie and Lloyd trying to get his camera out of his pocket.    Keith with a nice stocked Laker.    Lloyd with a big Whitie    ..and a second.    ..and a third.    Terry and I entertained a lot of fish... just couldn't get any to commit, other than one Terry had on briefly.  Around 4:30 we loaded up and headed home. Were having a good chat when I was taking a corner real slow and there was a loud pop in the front end. I thought maybe a universal joint let go in the front end drive shafts. Pulled over.. rocked the wheels.. had a good look but saw nothing. This truck was just in for $4200 worth of work at a local Chev dealer and new front brakes was one of the repairs. Drove a bit further up the road with the steering wheel shaking violently. Pulled over.. jacked up the front end and found the front wheel rocked 6"" in and out. Thought I had a broken wheel.. but no.. 3 sheared lug bolts. Someone at Chev needs there air gun calibrated!!    Lucky for us it didn't happen at speed at the next bend in the road... and very lucky the one bolt/nut was backed out further than the broken ones, but didn't shear or we would have been stranded on a back road in the middle of nowhere with only two bolts left. Tightened up the three remaining lug nuts and cautiously drove it home... to park ""as dead"" beside my dead F150. Good thing we have a third vehicle as we need to be in Ottawa by noon tomorrow.    Thanks for the great day guys !... Terry, I'll send you the bill for breaking my truck...."
287153,Terry,2009-01-03 02:31:00,14456,yeah but the wheel didnt fall off and we made it home even with the blizzard we drove home in...sounds like a great day to me
287155,ccmtcanada,2009-01-03 02:34:00,7971,"Never a dull moment eh Wayne??  At least some nice fish were caught!!  Sorry to hear about the sheared bolts...that just sucks!  Oh yeah...Where did January go?  I swear as I get older, the time just flies by.  Feb 2nd already...who knew??"
287157,irishfield,2009-01-03 02:35:00,26272, LOL... feels like it Cliff! Fixed..
287158,sonny,2009-01-03 02:36:00,511,"Great day fishing,,,sorry bout the truck,,,seen it many times,,,not tight enouugh so they  back off and snap,,definatly not from over tightening!"
287160,Leecher,2009-01-03 02:39:00,7832,Great report and pics Wayne  Some real nice looking whities you guys got into     Congratulations Just can't trust dealership mechanics now a days eh  Glad you guys made it back safely and thanks for sharing Jacques
287161,young_one,2009-01-03 02:40:00,620,Excellent report! The Whities seem to steal all the spot light on this trip!
287162,BUSTER,2009-01-03 02:41:00,1336,
287163,irishfield,2009-01-03 02:41:00,26272, Exactly Sonny .. they either didn't have the gun pressure turned up correctly or forgot to tighten it all together after hand running the nuts. So much for todays spec of hand torquing every nut. The saving grace was the one nut being way out and not snapping.
287165,BUSTER,2009-01-03 02:51:00,1336,take this over to the guy and shove this up his tail pipe!
287167,irishfield,2009-01-03 02:56:00,26272,I've got three of them Buster... and I'll beat him over the head instead as I don't want my snap on stuff in brown !
287169,steverowbotham,2009-01-03 03:03:00,1800,where was this? i'm itchin
287174,irishfield,2009-01-03 03:08:00,26272,Come on Steve... you know better than that...   Not my fishin hole... I'm not coughing it up.
287175,Sinker,2009-01-03 03:09:00,8692,"Nice Report Wayne!  Those whities are big!!! What was the technique for catching them? It aways seems to be different!! I'm out after them in the morning, wish me luck!!  Sinker"
287176,Rattletrap2,2009-01-03 03:11:00,1652,"Nice trip and pictures Wayne!  That really sucks about the truck! Especially when they advertise about ""Factory Trained"" service!!! They would be the first ones yacking about the need to torque....if it was anyone else doing the work."
287177,irishfield,2009-01-03 03:11:00,26272,"Nothing got nailed down that ""works"" Sinker. Lloyd takes the don't touch the rod at all approach and Keith light/mild jigging. I tried both... had lots of fish follow.. no committers."
287183,Sinker,2009-01-03 03:20:00,8692,"Your story reminds me of a time we were coming home from the saugeen river. My buddy just had new tires installed on his Jimmy at Costco. We're cruising down the 400, when the passenger front wheel, took off on us. Came right off the jimmy!!!! Talk about having a heart attack!! We got lucky too, the tire didn't hit anyone else,and came to a stop in the ditch. We got a few new lug nuts and put it right back on......no more problems after we checked the rest of the wheels!!!  Lucky nobody was hurt!!!  Sinker"
287189,walleyemaster,2009-01-03 03:58:00,325,nice report as usual wayne..wish i was there
287190,limeyangler,2009-01-03 04:03:00,5204,"EXCELLENT REPORT!!!!  Those are some really nice whities, trout and walleye too....great day on the ice....and all the fun of vehicular meltdowns(i know all about those....lol)  Great stuff Irish, really nice pics and write up,  thanks for that,   Limey"

287216,irishfield,2009-01-03 12:04:00,26272,"I didn't get a shot of that one Lloyd... I think Terry got it on his camera. You didn't yell loud enough for deaf ol' me to hear ""FISH ON !"" !!  Good luck today... I'm back on the road as well.. but not for ""fun""."
287217,Spiel,2009-01-03 12:17:00,9065,"....Good stuff guys! Odd though, I don't see any pics of Ron with fish?"
