290516,Greencoachdog,2009-01-11 01:18:00,8163,  I can C&R a fish... can you shoot and release an animal???
290520,rickster,2009-01-11 01:22:00,495,  no but I can make some pretty tasty pepperettes and sausage
290527,wallyboss,2009-01-11 01:42:00,1095,"I just laughed when I saw the title of the thread, cause somebody I know just posted them on his Facebook  and said that he took the pictures I wanted to know more about these moose so I Googled it, This post says that they were taken in B.C. , probably by the same guy who caught the BIG PIKE from Lake of the Woods , or was it Nippissing or Northern Que.  http://www.huntingbc.ca/forum/showthread.php?t=18646"
290580,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-11 02:53:00,709,awesome picture!!!!  iv got an uncle thats albino!  hes verry weird looking!
290587,brookieman,2009-01-11 03:08:00,68,"Cool pics but i'd say not from Timmins...or anywhere close.  Look at the trees in the background.  That's a huge stand of softwood.  While Birch and Poplar grow readily throughout the Timmins region, they don't grow in stands like that.  Even large stands of softwoods are densely populated with Spruce and Jack Pine."
290613,bigugli,2009-01-11 04:02:00,6138,"I saw a huge albino bull when I was a teen, but that was after it had been shot and was hanging.  Majestic looking creature in those pics. Certainly a rarity."
290630,highdrifter,2009-01-11 05:06:00,2534,That was totally kewl TJ.. Thanks!  cheers HD
290663,outllaw,2009-01-11 11:56:00,1232,simply awesome. most folks never see what mother nature has. . thank you for a good look. priceless.
290665,Handlebarz,2009-01-11 12:07:00,3790,Great shots the albino looks great my dad took a  pic of one in the early 90's around Timmins it was from far away not as good as these ones but it was still cool to check out.
290358,TJQ,2009-01-10 19:51:00,7806,Got these in my email today... wow...  Apparently taken up by Timmins.              
290360,johnnyb,2009-01-10 19:53:00,3413,WOW!!!!       That's amazing!
290361,Drew_10,2009-01-10 19:55:00,111,Awesome!   Thanks for the pictures
290367,irishfield,2009-01-10 20:00:00,26272,They get smarter and smarter trying to hide from yuz hunters TJ! lol
290368,BUSTER,2009-01-10 20:01:00,1336,wow
290369,Tinman,2009-01-10 20:02:00,376,Thats pretty cool! An albino moose!! Hides better i would think!
290370,walleyejigger,2009-01-10 20:03:00,876,"got these pics yeterday, very cool indeed, i know there are a couple in the horwood lake area near the groundhog river, but dont know if these are the ones"
290373,kickingfrog,2009-01-10 20:10:00,8333,"Neat photos, although when I saw albino in the subject line I had a horrible vision of TJ streaking, and yet I still clicked on it."
290375,Pappylachia,2009-01-10 20:12:00,4,"Thanks for posting these great pics. We've seen albino deer here in Ohio, but the only way we'd see a moose is if it were passing through while on vacation.  Pappy"
290376,Grimace,2009-01-10 20:14:00,2020,Looks like a Magpie in the tree.   I have only seen them out west in Alberta.   I have heard they can be around the Ontario-Manitoba border in the winter.   So I would think this is North West Ontario?
290377,Grimace,2009-01-10 20:16:00,2020,"Oh I see Timmins.   I missed that.    Sounds pretty far east for a Magpie.  It is in the Tree in the second picture.    Anyhow,  awesome pictures.   Really cool to see an albino moose!!"
290378,Mattones,2009-01-10 20:20:00,587,pretty cool pictures thanks for the post! I enjoy seeing Albino animals in pictures. so rare.
290379,Leecher,2009-01-10 20:21:00,7832,Amazing pics.... that's the first time I see one    thanks TJ for sharing
290402,sully,2009-01-10 21:16:00,40,"On the way to work last year, Hwy 7 / Queen St. going into Brampton, there is a farmers field on the north side that always has deer in it, saw an albino deer there last year couple of times, very weird looking..."
290407,Nemo,2009-01-10 21:25:00,727,Those have been around awhile. Good shots but I am not sure they are from Canada. Magpie is a giveaway.  Here they are from last year.  http://mainehuntingtoday.com/bbb/2008/03/2...o-moose-photos/  from  BC  http://arizonahuntingtoday.com/desertrat/2...te-moose-in-bc/
290422,canadadude,2009-01-10 21:48:00,769,"Years back 98/99 we had some albino deer down in Port Colbourne/ Wainfleet area and I was lucky enough to see these animals it was truelly a site to behold, for anyone that gets the chance to see an albinoe animal it really is a gift from the creator and truelly a beautiful site!!!"
290428,blakewalk,2009-01-10 22:12:00,86,that is incredible! thanks for the post! ive never seen photos of an albino moose b4
290429,Joey,2009-01-10 22:20:00,9122,Awesome pics TJ.  Only ones I've seen before are of the baby albino moose.  Those are fantastic pics.  Joey
290434,Bernie,2009-01-10 22:27:00,3190,Neat pics TJ. Would like to see one someday.  Had a customers car in yesterday and there were some strange marks in the salt stains. Apparently he has a tame moose that comes and licks the salt off his car. Hopefully he will bring me in some pictures.
290476,fishindevil,2009-01-11 00:00:00,6254,"WOW..Amazing looking animal for sure !!! thanks for sharing TJ,i would love to see one,they say in some areas that they are acually on the rise ??? is that true,other than being winter,wouldnt it be easier for predators to see them ???? white doesnt blend in with the green foliage of spring & summer very well, !!!!"
290480,young_one,2009-01-11 00:04:00,620,Surely a very majestic creature! Thank you for the picture!
290481,Moosebunk,2009-01-11 00:05:00,3970,Totally Gnarley TJ man!!!  Thanks.  Moose with a winter camo suit.
290496,Silo Buster,2009-01-11 00:39:00,81,Thats pretty cool
290504,Greencoachdog,2009-01-11 00:56:00,8163,"Albino???.. I don't think so!  That's what happens when they roll in the snow eh!!!  Moose!.. such a docile animal, anyone that shoots one should step on an anti personal landmine!!!"
290509,rickster,2009-01-11 01:04:00,495,  Almost as bad as those guys that use sabiki rigs    eh
