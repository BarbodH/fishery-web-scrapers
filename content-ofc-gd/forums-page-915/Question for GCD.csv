290357,Roy,2009-01-10 19:49:00,13728,"Water runs South there. Apparently, Logan is 8' above normal and it's a mess. In the winter, they drop it by 5'  but now (yesterday), It's 3' above that.  I got that straight from the Dawg's mouth....as it were...oh, and it's raining today too."
290455,Greencoachdog,2009-01-10 23:24:00,8163,"Yup! What Roy said... we gots a bit of a flood going on down here right now, but we really needed it!!!  The water tables have recovered... and then some!  I've been wanting to go fishing  , but my once peaceful lake is now a raging river with Alabama Power pulling 57,000 cubic feet of water per second thru the dam  !  We have 4 days forecast without rain next week and that will help."
