I only ask because I see lots of posts where people have caught 10, 20, and sometimes more Perch. I know there are limits but isn't this affecting the overall population in a negative way?  Makes me kind of glad that there is no Ice Fishing on my local lake(Rice Lake)."

289711,Raf,2009-01-09 00:54:00,3495,it is amazing tho.. how hard simcoe gets hit for perch.. yet the perch pop is healthy.
289912,Cudz,2009-01-09 14:23:00,2652,"I often think the exact same thing.  Even in the summer I can go out and catch 100 perch in a day.  in the fall when they come into kempenfelt and congregate between the fountain and the tiffen launch, you can easily catch 50 perch in an hour or so.  It does actually make you wonder how many perch there must be in that lake."
