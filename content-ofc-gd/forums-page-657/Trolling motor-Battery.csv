I have a trolling motor(30lb) and an optima D34 battery(55amp). How much run time should I expect if I where to be full throttle on the lake?"
486016,scugpg,2010-07-17 11:17:00,1373,I would guess it draws close to 25-30a full throttla so I would guess 1.5-2hrs.  If its a motor with maximizer technology dial it down and you'll get alot more out of the battery as its best at 30-60%.
