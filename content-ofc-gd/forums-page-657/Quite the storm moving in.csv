485666,JohnF,2010-07-16 01:26:00,3494," I was on my way home from Kawartha and got hit at 7:45 just east of Stratford. Loads of rain, great lightning show. Lots of radio signal interference for a while. I had to slow down for a few minutes on a paved road because of the rain. Still some lightning and a bit of rain at 9:25. Really not anything to get too excited about unless you're out in the middle of a lake.  JF"
485686,aniceguy,2010-07-16 02:20:00,1094,in Mississauga I just finished 2 beers and an awsome swim not a drop in the sky

485720,EC1,2010-07-16 06:50:00,930,"Glad I made it out before everything happened today. It didn't seem like a very big storm came in though.  Got onto the water at 9pm, fished close to 12am and was hearing thunder in the distance with the winds and rain somewhat picking up as we were going back. The fishing didn't really pick up either even though it was the time right before a storm kicks in."
485750,John,2010-07-16 12:44:00,2956,What storm? There was a storm?
