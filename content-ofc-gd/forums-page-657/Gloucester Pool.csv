485520,Syn,2010-07-15 17:27:00,519,"Much better than last year. Was there yesterday, caught a few LM and pike under 30"" nothing big. I lost a few pike on spinnerbaits so might want to use a sharped trailer hook. Trebles were good but I was hooking too many weeds. Mostly used spinnerbaits, spoon trolling, caught nothing using plastic worms . Even managed to hook a gar pike (they were swimming in a group of 3) but was relived it got unhooked before landing it. Was not in the mood to deal with its crazy teeth. Swimming was good too. Tried looking for a public sand beach but nothing found so far."
