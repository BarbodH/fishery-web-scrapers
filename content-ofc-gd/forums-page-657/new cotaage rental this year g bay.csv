486051,alexcba,2010-07-17 14:15:00,634,im sure everyone on here will tell you one thing. even with a hand held gps pay very close attention out on gbay. tons of area's are marked but there are still some turtle backs an inch underwater that will wipe out the bottom end of your motor in a second. i havent fished the area in a very very long time so i cant really help much. just be careful. hope you enjoy your time there.
486052,robinwood,2010-07-17 14:22:00,28,thanks for the input- I looked at marine chart and there are a zillion little X's on it I guess the bad news is rocks - the good news is structure!  May have to bring the net on this trip!  Robin
