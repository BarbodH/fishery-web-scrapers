485819,Sudzy,2010-07-16 18:43:00,88,I was looking at picking the same combo out to use as a trolling rod for dipsy divers.  Checked it out at Basspro and seemed pretty decent - also about 20 bucks cheaper there btw.
485821,Cookslav,2010-07-16 18:53:00,1457,A guy I know uses them with success and no issues to speak of. I'm sure there are better rods/reels but these seem to fit the profile of what is needed and I've not heard any poor feedback.
