The 2 inserts will fit inside the pipe which is 5/8"" ID but should fit snug. The inserts are 1.25"" long. Hopefully I explained it properly. I need 4, I'm making a custom seatbox tray and doing it this way I'll be able to make exactly what i need. Thanks.  Thanks Ron, I will contact them tomorrow."
