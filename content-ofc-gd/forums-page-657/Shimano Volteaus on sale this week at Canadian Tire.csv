485964,kyle7273,2010-07-17 02:27:00,65,They also have a Fenwick rod and a Abu spinning reel.
485971,Cudz,2010-07-17 02:55:00,2652,Thanks for the warning.  I would buy one of those rods if they cost $10.  No that is a lie.  I would not ever buy one of those rods.
485972,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-17 03:00:00,2050, Reall? Obviously I'd rather a compre or something but I don't really mind them! I also have a couple of those quantum resource cheapo's and don't mind them either.  It'd be nice to have a boat load of cumaras but I don't think that'll ever be in the budget and I really don't mind the voltaeus rods for the money....
485973,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-17 03:03:00,10439,An even better deal is the Eagle colour fish finder SKU# 79-8535-4 regularly $367.49 on for $146.99!!!! Great deal on an entry level colour finder.
485974,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-17 03:07:00,2050,Drifter.... Lol I was looking at a salt chlorinator that was regular 299.00 on sale for 249.00.... Decided to wait as we weren't setting up the pool yet and all of a sudden I see it advertised regular 249.00 on sale for 199.00!!!! lol maybe if I wait another month it'll be regular 199.00 on sale for 149.00
485979,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-17 03:16:00,10439,"  Yeah, I know. But any way you look at it a portable colour fishfinder for under $150 is a pretty good deal. If I didn't have over 1/2 a dozen finders already I would get one.  I see it's $349 and $139 pricing down south for yoose guys.  Eagle FishEasy 350C Fishfinder Portable"
485983,Cudz,2010-07-17 03:26:00,2652,"It is just my opinion but I can't stand the overweight spongy feel of these rods or an ugly stik for that matter.  They are strong but that is it.  I like my rods to have a backbone and not flex down by the handle.  Again, this is my opinion which can be taken how you want.  Let me put it this way.  If I was given one, I would regift it."
485986,fishinguypat,2010-07-17 03:44:00,547, who the hell would get it for the original price? lol
486006,JohnF,2010-07-17 08:29:00,3494, I'm with you on that.  JF
486029,The Urban Fisherman,2010-07-17 12:55:00,2050, I couldn't agree more aboutthe ugly sticks but I have used a few different actions of voltaeus rods and found them to be much better than the old ugly stick noodles.  They do have some fast action models with soft tips and some decent backbone.  Again they're no compre or crucial but I definitely prefer them over ugly stick rods if you get the right model.  Don't worry I have some shimano freak friends who tell me the same thing you do but I really don't mind them.  It's all what you can afford.
486069,The JAY,2010-07-17 16:50:00,239,"I picked one up a few months ago, at full price, and am completely satisfied with it. Of course, I'd love a $700 rod, but can't really justify the price.  Bang for your buck, you can't go wrong IMO."
486071,Fishnwire,2010-07-17 17:38:00,983,I checked out that Volteaus...I was less than impressed and would have to agree with Cudz.  I did buy one of the Fenwick Highlanders that was on sale.  It was normally $90 on sale for half price (I think) it seems like a half-decent rod for $45.  I usually break (or have broken for me) a rod or two ever year.  I just can't deal with the heartbreak of busting $200+ rods anymore.
486077,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-17 18:04:00,0,Its a good channel cat/carp/trolling rod but thats about it. Lebaron has good rods for under $60
486093,GBW,2010-07-17 20:41:00,8460,I sold my ugly stik and got one of the shimano's and it's WAAAY better.  The 7' one doesn't bend like a noodle and it a great walleye jigging rod for the money.
