485215,Angler16,2010-07-14 06:00:00,188,Going up to Nipissing in a few weeks. Staying in the south of Nipissing (Promised Land Camp) and I was wondering what the waters are like out in fish bay and hunters bay? What are the levels like? How hard is it to navigate throughout those two areas? Any help would be appreciated.  L.A
485417,Bernie,2010-07-15 02:22:00,3190,Water is 2ft lower than average for this time of year and dropping due to little rain and evaporation. Caution will be needed as there are rocks that are normally covered well enough. You should still be able to navigate easily in a small boat.
