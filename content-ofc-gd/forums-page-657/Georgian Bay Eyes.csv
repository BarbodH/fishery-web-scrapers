I'm really just posting this to make sure my photobucket account and linking are working properly..  I hit G-bay last weekend in search of Pickerel.  I've never caught a pickerel before, and it was my number one goal for this season to catch one.  Canada Day weekend, my fishing partner, and my wife both landed an eye each, but not me  Last weekend was my turn.  Hopefully these pictures work out.  I posted these pics earlier this week, but not with Photobucket, so it was a little messed up...            Can everyone see these pics??"

485309,kickingfrog,2010-07-14 17:12:00,8333, I've used that set-up a few times the last few years. I use a half of a power or gulp worm and sometimes it is the only thing that will produce strikes.

485390,NAW,2010-07-14 22:25:00,4022, Good to know man. Thanks eh!   I hear ya.  I almost always see a boat out there when I'm driving by.  I always wondered what the heck they where fishing for..
