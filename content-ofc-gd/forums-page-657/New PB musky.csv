484892,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-13 04:46:00,932,Congrats on a beautiful Musky.  Nice & Thick.  Thanks for Sharing
484906,splashhopper,2010-07-13 08:57:00,2931,hmmmm..... that fish loooks soooo much BIGGER than the bass I am targeting lately
484908,Rich Clemens,2010-07-13 09:46:00,3131,6 more inches ain't all that much.  You're just warming up now - now go get the 50.  Congrats on the PB
484910,WeedLine,2010-07-13 10:56:00,322,Good looking fish
484950,Fisherpete,2010-07-13 13:42:00,1814,"Beauty! Kawarthas fish? Nice and thick. Can I ask if you were trolling or casting the bulldawg? I have so far caught zilch on mine, and have no confidence in it at the moment despite the fact that it looks oh-so tasty in the water."
484961,Raf,2010-07-13 14:08:00,3495,I seriously doubt that is a Kawarthas fish Pete.
484972,Leecher,2010-07-13 14:25:00,7832,Nice gator    Congrats on your PB
484992,Devious,2010-07-13 15:34:00,49," Thanks! It was nice and thick with a 21"" girth!  Not a Kawarthas fish either I should add.  I was casting the bulldawg, it was my first muskie to hit away from the boat.  I was fishing it with a constant retrieve most of the day but after not getting a sniff I decided to change it up.  Within 20 casts of changing my retrieve I got it. The key was using long sweeps on the rod and letting the bait fall for a second."
485042,Fisherpete,2010-07-13 19:36:00,1814,Nice... I will try that on my next trip.
485045,lunkerbasshunter,2010-07-13 19:40:00,2585,wow great fish!!!  Cheers!
485150,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-14 00:41:00,0,"Nice Ski. That looks like a GB ski(more than likely Lake O, since you live in Kingston). Bulldogs are great lures, and are especially effective as a follow up lure, or a figure 8 lure."
485204,kerr,2010-07-14 03:13:00,77,"greasy fish davey, lets get at er in a weeks time"
