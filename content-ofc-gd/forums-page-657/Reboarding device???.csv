I think it will be close to the 1' 8"" limit once it is in the water (Have yet to get it out).  Does anyone know where I can get a fold up ladder that goes over the side of the boat around the Hamilton or Welland area. I know Canadian Tire has one, but it looks like a cheapie and is 69.99, which isn't too cheap. I want something decent, but don't want to spend a lot on it because it won't get used a lot.  Thanks!"

485420,Nipfisher,2010-07-15 02:39:00,2449,I built one too. used wood dowling and clothes line. it rolled up and fit nicely in a compartment. Then just clipped it on and through it over.
