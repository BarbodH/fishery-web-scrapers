485300,Stoty,2010-07-14 16:50:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  I have 1 weekend left in the summer that's free (seriously), and I want to go to a provincial park that allows unlimited horsepower, and has great Pike/Walleye/Bass fishing. I am willing to drive from 1-4 hrs from the GTA/Durham region.  Any help is much appreciated!  Feel free to PM me as well."
485311,Victor,2010-07-14 17:17:00,1609,possibly the massasauga? lots of water to explore around that area. I think it'd be tough to find a lake where they allow unlimited horsepower while there's decent fishing
485313,NAW,2010-07-14 17:20:00,4022,"I was going to suggest Massasauga as well.  Or French river.  6 Mile Lake is alright for bass and pike, and only about 2 hours from TO."
485328,bow slayer,2010-07-14 18:09:00,1074,"i am a big promoter of Restoule. Lots of bass and walleye,there are pike(mostly larger ones) but not great numbers because there are so many big muskies.  It is about 3 hours from GTA.Not alot of pressure on any of the lakes(restoule,stormy,clear,bass,lennon)"
485539,Nipfisher,2010-07-15 18:56:00,2449,"Stoty, If you're willing to drive the 4 - 4.5hrs to Temagami then Finlayson Park is a gret choice. Temagami is huge and the fishing is excellent. I will also put in a second vote for Bowslayer and agree that restoule is a good option."

I dont think that you would have to worry about a horsepower restriction on Smicoe, but you would definitely have to be careful boating around though, there are some ridiculous shoals out there.  Other than that I havent been to too many other Parks besides Algonquin, where I dont think you are allowed a motor at all."

485766,Stoty,2010-07-16 14:24:00,2910,"Thanks for everyone's input!  I have chosen Restoule as per bowslayer's recommendation!  Daryl, you can have motors in Algonquin, but only on a few lakes. Most of those lakes are 20HP and under, with the exception of Galiary Lake and Opeongo, which are the only two that allow unlimited HP."
