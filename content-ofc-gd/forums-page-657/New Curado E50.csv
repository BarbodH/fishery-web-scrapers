485705,uglyfish,2010-07-16 03:15:00,981,"meh, not bad. but im way more excited for the new quantum smoke PT reels"
485719,EC1,2010-07-16 06:34:00,930,"Jchau, I cannot believe this reel is of any interest to you! I bet this reel is going to perform, and get lots of praise for it, but I find that Curado's are kind of boring in terms of how they look. Especially when their 50, 200, and 300 sizes are all going to be the exact same colour."
485721,fish_fishburn,2010-07-16 08:04:00,1311,"Who cares how they look, just saying. How they work and perform is what matters."
485724,Bondar,2010-07-16 10:17:00,817,time for another one
485746,bdox,2010-07-16 12:14:00,329,"There's no way I'm waiting until Oct. for this. I'll be ordering it's equivalent from Japan, the Scorpion 1000XT."
485853,EC1,2010-07-16 21:18:00,930,"I agree with the fact that people choose function before form, but then there are a ton of other factors after that. If I can find a similar performing reel for the same amount of money, I guarantee you that the Curado's will not be my first choice.  Whether you get a scorpion, or another reel that performs at the same rate, Shimano could dominate (Yea I know they do already) the market even more if their Curado just used an extra few months to develop in terms of their visuals."
485862,Garry2Rs,2010-07-16 21:44:00,1425,"Visuals??? Look at Porsche, Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes Benz, form follows function. Perhaps you could add some flame decals."
485866,salmon,2010-07-16 21:48:00,334," Scorpion XT1000 Smoothest casting reel I have owned, casts farther casting than my pixy, Alphas, TDZ and Core 100. Almost as smooth as the Calais IMO      "
485959,EC1,2010-07-17 02:18:00,930,"See, that's exactly what I meant. Even a different colour and possibly they could have even used the Scorpion colours and I would have bought it.  Jchau, that looks amazing! Ready to sell it yet? haha  I'll save the flame decals to cover landmarks in my pictures"
