I live in Brantford and I went to Norfolk county last weekend to do a little scouting. While I was there I discovered that there are a lot of TICS. That is not something I need at this point because the wife doesnt want to go because of bugs, however I think I have her convinced. Anyhow maybe something within a couple of hrs from Brantford. Any Ideas?"
