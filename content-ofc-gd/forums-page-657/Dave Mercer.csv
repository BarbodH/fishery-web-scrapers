485562,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-15 20:14:00,932," LOL  I'd compare him more to ""The Pain-Train - Terry Tate (Office Linebacker)"" if you remember those commercials."
485595,aplumma,2010-07-15 22:18:00,6896,Actually Roy will allow almost all statements to be made here however if you are going to throw a stone you better not be hypocritical of the subject. I applaud his efforts and other mods in filling in the gaps when people go over the line and post things that are meant to harm someones character.I am sorry that Mr. Blizzard lost his cousin and I understand and accept his apology however it is important for all of us to remember that words have consequences even in cyberspace in this case it is bringing up the past by Roy.  Thanks Roy  Art
485597,Cudz,2010-07-15 22:25:00,2652,Jackie Moon Best promoter in Basketball! lol.  Free corndogs if the Tropics score 120!  That pic was of Jackie Mercer.  Funny stuff Dave.
485604,mr blizzard,2010-07-15 22:34:00,1589,"Thanks Radnine, I did bury my daughter 7 years ago so I know all about consequences. How many fathers have had to do that, I know some have. And for the armchair quarter backs, my cousin lost HER dad 7 years ago and her mother last year. My cousin who was killed  2 days ago lost her only brother and sister over the last ten years. She was the only surviving member of her family. Someone wants to talk to me about reality lets talk. Again thanks Radnine."
485606,Cudz,2010-07-15 22:47:00,2652,"Wow, not cool.  Sorry to hear about that."
485614,Gerritt,2010-07-15 23:09:00,6129,  Count me as one of those fathers...  However.. I have not lost my sense of humor.  G
485619,mr blizzard,2010-07-15 23:27:00,1589,"Aplumma I have respected your postings over time. My wife has served in our military for many years on the front lines, not in an office helping our friends to the south. Just for the record another cousin in Sudbury, years ago starred in one of the first movies with Arnold Swartzanager. He was a body builder who came just shy of making the the Olypics. He has endured Lou Garrits disease for seven years. Most do not live that long.   He has a wife and 4 beautiful children. Those children, in their teens are feeding their father and tying up his shoe laces. And maybe you wonder why family is so important to me. If you re read my post carefully I did not shoot down Dave. If you fight for this country and make a fair comment you should not have to apologize for being decent."
485624,Gerritt,2010-07-15 23:36:00,6129,Admin can we please shut this thread down... as it is going nowhere fast.. and is only going to go round and round...  obviously MB has some issues with loved one that have been lost...  no sense in making a spectacle.  G.
485458,bassman,2010-07-15 12:21:00,384,I don't know what to say.  
485461,mr blizzard,2010-07-15 12:38:00,1589,
485466,bassman,2010-07-15 12:51:00,384,I thought it was funny.
485468,bushart,2010-07-15 12:54:00,2628,No difference than something that could be seen on any billboard in the world.  Kids see worse in the schoolyard or online when your not lookin.  Only thing Davy Boy----That Fro has Gots to Go!!
485470,bdox,2010-07-15 13:17:00,329,"I'm pretty sure that's Dave's face on Will Farrell's body, taken from ""Semi-Pro"""
485477,NAW,2010-07-15 14:02:00,4022,  For sure man..  Mercer has easily 50lbs on that torso..  Still funny though.
485479,BillM,2010-07-15 14:03:00,17367,"  I hope you don't let them on the internet, watch TV or even look at the billboards as they drive down the road then..  Because there is ALOT worse out there then this, let's not make a mountain out of a mole hill here..."
485480,tb4me,2010-07-15 14:07:00,3295,Ha ha funny stuff..good ol jackie Moon..
485482,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-15 14:16:00,932,"It's all in good fun, but there are always people that will take the ""moral high road"" with things like this."
485485,Roy,2010-07-15 14:35:00,13728,"Careful when you throw stones, mr. blizzard. I seem to recall some posts which would have been better suited for the children of the community?  How about this one for example? "
485488,perchslayer666,2010-07-15 14:50:00,280,^^ Epic Fail.
485489,lookinforwalleye,2010-07-15 14:53:00,4399,  You serious??  I thought it was pretty funny but i`ll tell ya it would be way funny if Dave put a big decal of that on the side of his boat.
485493,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-15 14:59:00,932,I'm sure Dave could look a lot less flattering if he wanted to lol.  He doesn't exactly have the physique of a titan.
485494,alexcba,2010-07-15 15:02:00,634, i don't get what it is you're offended by exactly? have you or your children ever seen an episode of the simpsons or family guy? or maybe any other tv show or movie out there g rated or not? its a joke dude.. i don't think you have to worry about your children being scarred for life by daves head being photo shopped to will ferrels body..
485502,danbouck,2010-07-15 15:30:00,4380,It could be worse!  
485512,Twocoda,2010-07-15 16:27:00,4130,  is there photo shopping done in this pic???
485513,rylan,2010-07-15 16:32:00,134,you mean a billboard like this :   http://fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/another-anti-obama-billboard/
485515,Joey,2010-07-15 16:52:00,9122,"I think its hilarious.  He reminds me of Bob on ""That 70's Show.""    Joey"
485526,Harrison,2010-07-15 17:57:00,2202,I was thinking a little ELO Jeff Lynne  
485528,Spiel,2010-07-15 18:05:00,9065,"  I was thinking I'm gonna lose my breakfast, then I realized I have eaten yet. Thank God.  "
485529,bushart,2010-07-15 18:06:00,2628,"  If Dave can sing 3 lines from "" Evil Woman""  I'll buy it"
485538,mr blizzard,2010-07-15 18:51:00,1589,Sorry for posting. My cousin was killed 2 nights ago in Toronto. I have been working on the funeral arrangements. I guess for that reason I have been a little edgey. I apologize.
485540,Radnine,2010-07-15 18:57:00,1538,  Sorry to hear of your loss. Jim
485550,esoxansteel,2010-07-15 19:35:00,1307, Im going to make damn sure Im a good boy with only positive messages as Roys always llurking out there somewhere just when you think hes asleep at the wheel he comes out of nowhere just like the old intimidator himself Roy might be the Dale Earnhardt of OFC
485554,Dutchy,2010-07-15 19:56:00,416,"I thought it was hilarious myself, although disturbing"
