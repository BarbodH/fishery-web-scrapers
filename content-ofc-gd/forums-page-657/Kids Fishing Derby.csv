485166,skeeter,2010-07-14 01:34:00,1907,"My wife and I run a kids fishing derby in our trailer park every year. we have on average 200 kids from the park come out for it . this is our 12th year doing it. every kid gets a prize, and their lunch. and it is free for all kids. this year the kids brought in 357 lbs of fish. the best part for us is seeing all the smiling faces.  of course we couldnt do it without the people who donate prizes and Larosa's  NoFrills at victoria pk& lawrence for the food.  and of course our volunteers, one of them who happens to be a member of this board, Tracker. Tracker is our weigh in official, and has been from the start. this year he was also the entertainment too. when he weighs the fish he releases them back into the lake, but for some reason he decided to get into the lake to do it--LOL well atleast he didnt get his cell phone wet. thanks for your help. dann & kelly  "

485398,Dondorfish,2010-07-14 23:17:00,1000,"Think I had as much fun as the kids did! Had a great turn out and everybody left happy. Dann and Kelly do an awsome job, starting in September, to collect prizes for the following year. Kelly makes sure that every kid, no matter how many, get a prize at the end of the day. The annual Kids Fishing Tourny is definately one of the highlights of my summer at the trailer and I am proud to be a small part of it.   Tracker (Don)"
