485018,The JAY,2010-07-13 17:35:00,239,"Okay, I'm heading up to Lady Evelyn for a week in September, and being the tech junkie that I am, I would like to get my hands on a Garmin map for the lake. I've got the Bluechart maps for Ontario and Erie, but I can't find a map for Lady Evelyn. I can't even find one on the Garmin site. I've found some aftermarket map companies on the net, but I'm a little leary of 'no-name' maps.  Does anyone have one that they have used and would recommend? I'm trying to find structures in the lake, and the mroe detail, the better.  Thanks!"
485031,bdox,2010-07-13 18:47:00,329,"You will need a copy of ""Canada Inland Lakes â€” Ontario"" from Garmin. About $100 at Radio World.  Garmin - https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=37821 List of Lakes - http://www8.garmin.com/cartography/inland/canada_lists/Ontario.pdf"
485033,Lunkerhunter,2010-07-13 18:56:00,455,garmin has one on there website.  it is pretty vague but it does have more detail than not having one.  https://buy.garmin.com/shop/buymaps.do

486070,The JAY,2010-07-17 17:10:00,239,"Thanks for the info. That's what I was looking for, but was hoping for an endorsement from a user. The Inland Lakes - Ontario is the one I'm going to go with. Now I have to find someone with a copy...."
