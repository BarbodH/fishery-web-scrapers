485737,fisher,2010-07-16 11:21:00,451,"Going to a friend's cottage for the day on Shadow Lake in Norland and was wondering if anyone had a map of the lake (showing depths)?  Also, what can I hope to catch there?  He is not into fishing so he is not sure of anything other than Bass.  I would be thankful to anyone who can email me a map of the lake at [emailÂ protected]  Thanks Fisher"

485802,fisher,2010-07-16 17:02:00,451, Thanks for the PM.  Anyone out there have a map to send to help a guy out?  It was a last minute invite so I couldn;t have really prepared any sooner.  Another option is if someone can tell me if there is a fishing store in and around the area that will be open when I plan to arrive tomorrow around 6am?
