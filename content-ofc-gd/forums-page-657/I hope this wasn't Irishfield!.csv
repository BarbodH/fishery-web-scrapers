485256,ketchenany,2010-07-14 14:11:00,3229,Great that no one got hurt . . .  Another project for Irish!
485276,alexcba,2010-07-14 14:48:00,634,glad no one got hurt.
485302,bigfish1965,2010-07-14 16:55:00,3382,I think Wayne likes insurance jobs
485322,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-14 17:46:00,932,"A close call for sure, good to see that everyone is ok."
485432,irishfield,2010-07-15 03:58:00,26272,"I won't comment on the issue... other than no it wasn't me. Airplane is actually still in excellent condition, floats are another story.  I still haven't got mine up there... been a tad tied up with family matters. But my brother survived his quint bypass today (6 hours in OR) and I hope to be flying to the lake late tomorrow or Friday... and I'll try not to land in the ""short"" lane !"
485454,TennesseeGuy,2010-07-15 11:33:00,957,Cause was faulty brakes.  Look for a recall.
485455,splashhopper,2010-07-15 11:40:00,2931,"  There are ""brakes"" on float planes"
485469,irishfield,2010-07-15 13:01:00,26272, LOL Connie!! He should have dropped the gear 1/2 way thru the slide.. it was an amphib! Although I hear he hit the dock still doing 40 knots!
485471,Roy,2010-07-15 13:24:00,13728,"Some guys just don't realize that when it rains on a lake, the surface gets super slick and you need to keep your distance to brake in time."
485473,Harrison,2010-07-15 13:35:00,2202, your a character Roy
485478,SylvanOwner,2010-07-15 14:03:00,266,"  ha ha.....is this where the term ""hydroplaning"" was born.....lol"
485487,TennesseeGuy,2010-07-15 14:48:00,957,The driver was probably texting.
485505,dannyboy,2010-07-15 15:42:00,367,"""Although I hear he hit the dock still doing 40 knots!""  40 knots? dang, he'd be darn near airborne, well up on-step anyway. Was he trying to land on the dock!?  Dan"
485522,irishfield,2010-07-15 17:35:00,26272, Damn.. is there a law against that now? Now what am I gonna do know while going cross country? Hope they don't ban taking pictures tooooo ....  Hope you're well my friend..
485523,irishfield,2010-07-15 17:38:00,26272, Yes definitely sliding on the step Dan and not in a channel we normally use for landing unless there's some good wind..  First time there.. raining.. probably a quick decision to land that obviously didn't go well. About sums it up... kinda like day dreaming and bumping some guy at the lights in your car. (just more expensive!) I won't say anything further on an open forum other than crap happens.
485546,dannyboy,2010-07-15 19:09:00,367," Sure does and it can happen fast, here is the type of project I spend time putting back together:  "
485548,irishfield,2010-07-15 19:18:00,26272,OOPS.. that one of Hydro Ones?
485633,camillj,2010-07-16 00:17:00,1988," Good to hear Wayne, hope all is well for him !"
