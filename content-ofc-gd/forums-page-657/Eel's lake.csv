485589,Jer,2010-07-15 22:07:00,1426,"I've got next week off for vacation and my fishing partner and I are trying to plan a few daytrips to get away from the hustle & bustle of the Tri-Lakes.  Eel's Lake (between Apsley & Bancroft) has always interested me and I think we may give it a go one day next week.  Of course, I'm not looking for anybody's ""hot-spots"", just a general idea of what to expect. Also, if anyone knows where to get a decent map of the lake, that would be great. I've got the ""Backroad Mapbooks"" version, but it isn't very detailed.  Thanks for any help."
