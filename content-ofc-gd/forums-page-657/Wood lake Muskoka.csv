I will have access to a boat while there but can't find any info on the lake. Has anyone ever fished there before and what are the most common species, tactics, suggestions. I'm leaving on Saturday morning, looking forward to some good weather!  Thanks"

We fished the west end of the lake around the islands and docks etc. Pulled in 13 bass and 11 Walleye. Mepps #3 was the killer for the week. On the last day I lost it in the rocks!!! Grrrr I'll post some pics later in the week. They're on my buds camera. Great little lake and great fishing with my son and the guys."
