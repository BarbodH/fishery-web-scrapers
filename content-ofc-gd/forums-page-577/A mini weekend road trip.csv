549310,s2k4mee,2011-02-09 04:38:00,73,Good job guys.  And all the best to you MJL =)
549315,ctranter,2011-02-09 05:25:00,543,Good stuff man!!!  I've always wanted to eating a ling
549321,l2p,2011-02-09 09:32:00,346,"great lookin trip boys! i can finally now believe that theres lakers in that lake haha. ive spent many hours on that lake lookin for them in the summer when i go up to buddies cottage and only ever pulled out smallies! we always mark tonnes of fish suspended deep though we never got any to commit, ive even heard stories of ppl catching browns and bows in same lake! but i guess those two have still yet to be proven  best wishes as always and see you out on the water soon!!!"
549361,Spiel,2011-02-09 14:38:00,9065,"Good to hear from you Mike, lots to absorb in your post.  First I'm happy you got the mags, not so happy that they'll be reading material during chemo.  Nice weekend getaway as well, been a few years since I've been up in the near north for winter lakers, always a good time though.  You three are hardcore....  Be well and please keep me/us up to speed on your progress."
549373,Victor,2011-02-09 15:05:00,1609," We were pretty tired by the time we walked back to the car with all the snow/slush, after a full day of fishing. I was devastated lol, drilled alot of holes and covered alot of grounds trying to find some active fish, and skunking.  Couldn't have passed up the chance to redeem myself when we heard that the ling turn on at night haha. That was my biggest ever fish on ice though so i was happy. Now I just need to catch my first ever laker soon."
549374,Twocoda,2011-02-09 15:11:00,4130,Nice shootin guys ...great report !  Good friends + good fishing = Good times and great memories...
549375,Victor,2011-02-09 15:11:00,1609, Oh man I look so tired in this one.  thanks for putting this together mike!
549385,Beans,2011-02-09 15:52:00,3339,Terrific report Mike !  I hope you have a quick recovery and looking forward to sharing this same shore again this summer...     BTW...That mac and cheese diet should make you my size in no time...
549466,aplumma,2011-02-09 20:54:00,6896,Best wishes and a prayer for you at the hospital Mike. We need you well to post some more reports.   Art
549473,misfish,2011-02-09 21:09:00,29133,SUPER REPORT MIKE. Thanks for posting the pic of the sled.Just what I need to make.
549586,alphaalpha,2011-02-09 23:47:00,475,Great report!  That ski set-up is very similar to one i made for my rig last year except i have a couple vertical bars to keep the hut centered (i don't use any bungies).  Definately saves tons of effort hauling the gear out.  The fish may have been small but spending time catching any fish is still better than dealing with the stink of skunk.   All the best with your treatment and I hope you have a quick recovery!
549596,Joeytier,2011-02-10 00:00:00,3990,"Good on ya for gettin out, and some great shots too.  Your reports are always a great read.  Best of luck with treatment.  Whoever mentioned the food at Sunnybrook was right...gross"
549930,corvette1,2011-02-10 18:03:00,1765,awesome trip guys congrats
550221,MJL,2011-02-11 02:25:00,2427," Thanks Ron  My mom picked up a whole bunch of those Ensure things...Haven't tried one yet - She got 3 flavours. I have the metabolism of a hummingbird  The trip to the hog spital was fairly quick. Spent 4.5hrs at Sunnybrook, the last hr being hooked up to the IV and the rest of the time undergoinvarious tests and waiting.  The nurses were impressed with my choice of reading materials ...Beyond the mags Spiel sent me, I also read the book, '50 places to fly fish before you die' (not that I plan to expire anytime soon )...Anyone up for a steelhead trip to the Skeena or a bonefish/Giant Trevally trip to Christmas Islands and/or a trip to the Rio Negro in the Amazon for peacock bass?"
550257,Leecher,2011-02-11 03:45:00,7832, Thanks for the update Mike... Glad that your additional treatment to the hog spital is over and done with  You be well and I'll keep you in my thoughts Jacques
549227,MJL,2011-02-09 01:13:00,2427,"It’s been a little while since I last posted.  I’m most certain that I missed some awesome reports  A couple weeks ago, I got the news that I will need additional treatment in the form of chemotherapy and have been prepping for it since.  Not fun by any means – especially after reading Irishfield’s daughter’s battles through it.  As always, I’m blown away by the support OFC and its members having given me since I first became a member  Spiel again has been incredibly generous.  Mid-last week I received another awesome package to read while I’m at the hospital getting my chemo-drip    There have been others on this forum that have gone through chemo and they’ve been amazingly supportive answering all the questions and giving me all the tips they could – I can’t thank you guys enough  . As one member mentioned, “treat it like a bump in the road instead of a road block”, and that’s exactly what I plan to do  With pending treatment starting Thursday, I figured I’d like to make this last weekend a little special.  Last week, Frozen Fire, Victor and I planned a weekend trip for some laker action.  Friday night after work, we made the pilgrimage north to one lake and checked in at a motel for the night.  What do you do when there are 3 guys and only 2 beds?  You bring an air mattress and rearrange the furniture to fit it in!   Spent some time gearing up and setting up our tackle late into the night.   Saturday morning, we head out to the lake.  Last week, my dad made a ski system for Frozen Fire’s portable hut.  It made pulling the hut over the snow so much easier.      After some time spent locating fish, I finally managed my first laker of 2011 .  It was a lot smaller than what I was hoping for but very welcomed nonetheless.  Watching the flag pop up on my HT rod holder was pretty exciting – It took a small minnow.      For the first time ever, I managed to get 1 fish to chase down my lure on the retrieve and nail it.  It swam from 65ft to 35ft to eat my jig + minnow combo.  Watching it all go down on the fish finder was exciting to the max!   A wave goodbye   In total, both Frozen Fire and I managed to land only 3 tiny lakers each to about 15 inches or so.  Vic blanked.  We fished from 8am to sundown and packed it in for the day... Or so we thought...  While packing the car, we met a couple who were going out for some nighttime ling fishing.  Intrigued by the prospects of trying poor man’s lobster, we decided to stop in for dinner somewhere before heading back out on the ice for the midnight bite.  8pm we hit the ice...Again...  It was a cold and windy night. We kept warm by moving around and drilling a ton of holes (at least I did).  We fished from 8pm till about 1am (I think...I can’t remember exactly when we got back to the motel   ). Victor landed 2 ling and Frozen Fire landed 1.  I didn’t get any action all night      We slept in Sunday...Well Vic and Frozen Fire did. I ate a big breakfast and went through my pre-fishing trip routine that increases my Jedi fishing powers  I was hoping that Sunday would bring us some bigger fish.  I did manage to catch the most lakers I’ve ever caught in 1 day. Unfortunately the 6 I landed were all pretty much the same size as the ones we got the previous day - I probably lost about 7-8 fish . I was pretty amazed that a lake trout would try to eat something roughly half its size      It was a long drive home (especially for Victor who did the driving in a super gear packed SUV).I was pretty exhausted at work Monday morning from the weekend. But I definitely can't wait to do another trip like that again...Maybe next time I'll take a sick day from work on the Monday  Hope you enjoyed"
549232,irishfield,2011-02-09 01:20:00,26272,Very nice guys... you could have spooned in a bed no?? lol  MJ.. where are you doing your chemo.. how many days per....#weeks apart...#sessions
549235,EC1,2011-02-09 01:25:00,930,"Man, I was waiting for this report. I should have went on Saturday even if it meant only fishing a few hours."
549236,mercman,2011-02-09 01:30:00,7054,"MJ !!! As always i savor every word of your reports.Always feel like i.m right in there with you.Thanks. Good luck on your treatment.You will be beat this thing, you just wait and see.   Paul"
549237,Leecher,2011-02-09 01:33:00,7832,Great report and pics Mike Sounds like a fun trip Good luck with the additional treatment.... I will keep you in my thoughts Leechman
549240,trapshooter,2011-02-09 01:37:00,1234,Looks like a great weekend with your buddies.  The picture you labeled 'a wave goodbye' is really cool!  Sounds like you've got a good attitude towards your chemo treatments and a great support network of family and friends.  Best wishes for a full recovery.
549242,danbouck,2011-02-09 01:49:00,4380,Great report as always!
549243,Dusky,2011-02-09 01:49:00,310,As usual good read/report MLJ. Hopefully things will get better for you.
549247,KelfuN,2011-02-09 02:00:00,246,"glad you guys had a blast up there this past weekend..sure beats working on a saturday night!!  we'll go for some drifts after i come back from vacation, perfect time for droppies"
549248,MJL,2011-02-09 02:04:00,2427,"Thanks guys   Hey Wayne, I’ll be going in to Sunnybrook for it. So far, only 1 treatment planned and I’m pretty thankful for that. May be another one 3-4wks after but the oncologists are pretty confident I won’t need it (I hope).  Out of everything, I was pretty surprised at the cost for the anti-nausea pills – The doctors advised me that I may still feel queasy and it’s going to suck for about a month per treatment.  At the moment, I’m already underweight so I’ve been doing my best to pack on the pounds the last couple weeks (which has been just 3lbs to put me up at 121lbs  ).  My boss recommended Mac & Cheese made with butter and cream or a big piece of steak which doesn’t sound too bad right now.LOL"
549249,Rod Caster,2011-02-09 02:04:00,5784,Enjoy those ling and best wishes!  
549250,solopaddler,2011-02-09 02:04:00,8605,"Great to read a report from you Mike! I can't believe you nutbars had dinner then fished again on the open ice 'till 1am after fishing all day in the cold! For ling!  I think I remember what it was like to have that kind of fire burning in my belly.   Ahh to be young.   You're a fighter, stay the course and beat this thing!  I'm looking forward to showing you some special steelhead spots this year.  Chris, very nice gesture of you.  Cheers"
549252,Roy,2011-02-09 02:06:00,13728,"Thanks for the great report, Mike! You take care and get through this stuff soon so you can get back to fishing sooner.  BTW, Mike have you considered starting a poll on here asking if that last fish might be a splake?"
549253,Joey,2011-02-09 02:06:00,9122,"Great report MJL, well done on the lake trout, even tho they weren't as big as you had hoped.  Those ling are funny looking creatures eh     Did they taste like lobster?  Sorry to hear about your situation.  Hope treatment goes well for you.  Please keep us updated bud.  Joey"
549255,irishfield,2011-02-09 02:09:00,26272,"I hear, from the oncologist no less, that the food at Sunnybrook is worse than Mount Sinai's.... and he says that Sinai's is just the food Air Canada refuses for their flights!!! Go prepared with a back up plan.. family/friends that can run for/deliver meals on your behalf if your treatment requires stay, or are you just in for the day and then out?"
549259,Grimace,2011-02-09 02:22:00,2020,Great report.  All those hours on the ice and no hut?  You guys are as tough as nails.  I hope you get well as quickly as possible.

549266,spinnerdoc,2011-02-09 02:38:00,556,great to see you fishin...best of luck on your treatment...
549281,splashhopper,2011-02-09 03:14:00,2931,"great report MJ..... your positive disposition will serve u well in this period of your life. Thank you for sharing this past weekend with us.  Now, to help`add the weight,  start drinking 3-6 can's of Ensure per day...( my asian wife is in same boat as you for weight issues). Because you NEED the weight gain, and NEED to prevent the weight loss, your doctor will be able to prescribe it for you. (Hopefully u have benefits.)  If that doesn't sound good, try lots and lots of roast pork with big heloings of rice and eat it late at night..... u should puff up and look like a potatoe faced red neck like me in no time!`  Prayers from London for you ...."
549284,MJL,2011-02-09 03:19:00,2427,"Cheers guys and thanks again for all the comments   I’ll be there just for the day (planned for about 6-10hrs or so I’m guessing)...The nurse doing the chemo class on Monday recommended that we bring our own food – Anything that doesn’t stink - Like sardines or herring.  She also said the food at the hospital wasn’t all that great either.  The only hospital food I've ever eaten was Jell-O.  I was at Mt Sinai last week. I guess I was fortunate not to have to sample their food.   Personally I hate needles and get grossed out so food probably won’t be on my mind while I’m sitting there  .  I’ll pack some snacks to bring along   Thanks Grimace. I’m pretty acclimatized to the cold.  Late fall/early winter steelheading before the rivers lock up will do that to you . I do love fishing outside way more than inside the hut...I get to stretch my legs out.  My parents got me a survival suit for Christmas and it’s been awesome. Last year I just wore a whole lot of fleece and a gore-tex jacket over it all and it was pretty miserable when it hit -20C or -15 with wind chill.  Also picked up a wicked set of mitts from MEC for times when gloves just don’t cut it:  These: http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442633339&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302885383  Next purchase will be a better set of waterproof boots   Definitely can't wait!   Thanks Joey.  Victor took the Ling...After seeing the slime ooze off the cooler (and everything else we put in there) when we took the fish out, I figured I'd let him have them  Cheers & all smiles"
549292,frozen-fire,2011-02-09 03:49:00,542,"Great trip indeed. Got into our first lakers of the season and some ling action too LOL. Big thanks to Mike's dad for the construction of the DIY ski system which we used to pull out our gear. Worked great. Loaded on a 2 man portable hut, 2 chairs, and 2 sleds... full of gear including augers and finders.  Here is Mike dragging it out to the laker territory.   My first laker of the year! "

549304,hammercarp,2011-02-09 04:18:00,964,It is good to hear from you Michael. That was a great report. Do you want me to put you on the roster for the CanAM ? It will be at Long Sault on the weekend of Aug.6. Jeff Vaughn and Vali will be running it so it should be an unforgettable event. I am sure the guys are looking forward to seeing you back in action on the Larry.
549305,bigugli,2011-02-09 04:18:00,6138,"Great report. Good to see out out and enjoying life.  The amazing thing about adversity is that you can let it overcome you, or you can blow it down. You've got the right attitude to beat it down good. Keep it up."
549307,Moosebunk,2011-02-09 04:27:00,3970,Fantastic report man.  Keep yer chin up and fish on the ice.  Super pics too...
