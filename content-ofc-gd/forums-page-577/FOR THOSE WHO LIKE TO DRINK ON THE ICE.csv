549748,Cookslav,2011-02-10 04:48:00,1457, Dave's not here man
549750,GBW,2011-02-10 04:49:00,8460,"no, open up it's ME Dave I've got the stuff..."
549751,irishfield,2011-02-10 04:54:00,26272,That's ajax man...  ..how did we get here.. seriously! lol
549758,fishing n autograph,2011-02-10 09:08:00,2540,You're not supposed to drink the bong water guys...
549665,irishfield,2011-02-10 02:01:00,26272,"LOL Doc.. and I have a bag of ""emerg munchy reserve"" in the fridge and a little piece of paper that says we can have it there.. so not ALL possession is illegal."
549671,fishing n autograph,2011-02-10 02:20:00,2540, i've yet to see a prescription that isn't forged on a stolen prescription pad lol....
549672,fishing n autograph,2011-02-10 02:21:00,2540," yeah, i guess you'll say that when the neighbourhood pot dealer sells your kid some weed laced with crystal meth...."
549673,irishfield,2011-02-10 02:25:00,26272, well I guess I could make a first for ya !
549674,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 02:27:00,0,"  and who's pushing weed sale into the criminal element?  and why would they ""lace"" weed with another drug that costs money?  would that not cut into their profits.  nice propaganda though."
549675,Rod Caster,2011-02-10 02:29:00,5784,"  Pot is illegal because the dealers are dirtbags...yet if it was legalized these guys would be out of a job.  To the op.... there shouldn't be a law against drinking on the ice itself, there's no harm done there. Drinking and driving is bad in all situations and there are already laws against that. Nothing special about drinking on the ice vs. anywhere else."
549679,Joey,2011-02-10 02:37:00,9122,  I think they lace it so it gets the kids hooked and needing more!!
549681,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 02:44:00,0,"when life slips you a jeffery, stroke a furry wall."
549682,GBW,2011-02-10 02:48:00,8460,"when did you say we are getting out for lunch again?  I have zero problem with a few beers on the ice, but being told no way now how isn't fair either.  I guess non of the cop's that play hockey on a weekly team never bring beer into the dressing room where the sign does say 'no outside alcohol aloud'..."
549684,mercman,2011-02-10 02:52:00,7054,  Naw Pressure from friends and school mates gets kids hooked far quicker and more efficiently than laceing weed with cheap easy to make crystal meth.
549687,fishing n autograph,2011-02-10 02:59:00,2540,Hmm let's just think about that shall we...  Why do they lace it with a more expensive drug? It's not propaganda and it happens because the user will come back for the more expensive stuff when they are hooked. It only takes a few hits of meth to get hooked...but I guess you already know that...and I'm sure you know all the ins and outs of the drug trade too
549689,mercman,2011-02-10 03:02:00,7054,
549693,fishing n autograph,2011-02-10 03:04:00,2540,And yes peer pressure and other influences help too
549697,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 03:11:00,0,"You're too much. Anybody out there ever smoke a laced joint?  If a person was able to grow their own, would it be laced too? "
549713,Dara,2011-02-10 03:26:00,3052,Now I know where to come when I want to get lectured.
549727,Hoppy,2011-02-10 03:58:00,95,"  Well pot is legal for sum 3000 or so (the numbers keeps climbing) Canadians for medical reasons. It should be legalized not decriminalized for all for personal freedom if not just to get it out of high schools. It's easier for kid to get pot than beer. Get it. The law is wrong for our communities, wrong for or kids.  The get them ""hooked on the laced joint"" propaganda is just that, propaganda spread by cops and there unions who realize if the drug war ended 1/3 of there funding would vanish.  Face it cops and there unions just want to build more jails, pass more laws, hire more cops, make the police union & lobby groups more powerful..... and repeat.....and repeat. They won't be satisfied till the only ones left on the street are cops. Just ask any cop, they believe all citizens are criminals.  OK Back on topic. I've spent my whole life here fishing the ice of Simcoe. It's only been recent years (OK 2 or 3 decades) people have used vehicle to get out on the ice, and a lot of locals still walk to there huts. Remember there are people who live here and are not commuting to fish. Who's business is it if they drink in the huts or get hammered for that matter. Some people do cause problems when drunk but we have lots of laws to deal with those problems including severe drinking and driving laws.  Peace Hoppy"
549729,Hoppy,2011-02-10 04:04:00,95,Oh and for the record I don't drink on the Ice very often but I smoke cannabis every time.  Peace Hoppy
549731,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 04:08:00,0, Aren't you worried about crystal meth?

549736,BiggFish,2011-02-10 04:18:00,40,"Hey,  Does anyone know where I can get a dime bag?"
549739,archie_james_c,2011-02-10 04:20:00,618," Working, going to college, shooting guns and bows and trying to catch glossy eyed toothy fish through the ice. Tryin to get back on OFC with some regularity again.  How have you been Dr. Sal?"
549740,archie_james_c,2011-02-10 04:21:00,618, You ain't got no hair at all Dara

549553,fishhunter,2011-02-09 22:59:00,604,HERE IS A LINK YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT IF YOU DRINK ON THE ICE OR IN YOUR SHACK http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2967211
549562,Bernie,2011-02-09 23:14:00,3190,So why can you drink and drive on a golf course? Because bureaucrats and lawyers are golfers.
549563,Old Man,2011-02-09 23:17:00,822,  :good:
549565,misfish,2011-02-09 23:22:00,29133,Polo golf.Now thats fun.
549568,mercman,2011-02-09 23:27:00,7054,"Never understood why you have to drink to fish It just makes no sense at all. Fish, drive home safely, have a few beers talk about your day. At least there would be less yellow snow mucking up the pristeen landscape and less bloodstained snowbanks along the sides of our highways.Who cares if you can drink in an ice hut or not....really"
549573,fishing n autograph,2011-02-09 23:32:00,2540, you can drink if you're walking on the course because it's considered private property and the course has a liquor licence....but if you're impaired and driving a golf cart it's no difference than if you're driving a car
549581,misfish,2011-02-09 23:42:00,29133," Awe but,if they serve you,somebodies going to make alot of money in a lawsuit.Just say,n."
549591,Bernie,2011-02-09 23:50:00,3190,Well it's a good thing they don't set up ride programs on the golf course.
549593,smally21,2011-02-09 23:58:00,993,this is exactly what was said on the last post - how can you follow the law if the enforcement community doesn't know what it is?  oh yeah - i've been absolutely sideways   in my golf cart.....
549595,GBW,2011-02-09 23:59:00,8460,young_one and I got pulled over last year getting off the ice and the cop didn't believe that we didn't drink cause I had a open box of beer in my car.  I offered to do a breath test and that's when he let me go.  We left the beer in my car and took his truck out on the ice.
549606,cram,2011-02-10 00:20:00,1733,I like a cold beer when i'm ice fishing.   I guess its illegal - so will live with the ticket if i ever get one - but reality is I walk out to my spot.  Worse thing that can happen (police wise) is getting a ticket for having open liquor.
549607,cram,2011-02-10 00:22:00,1733, I for one like a cold beer when i'm ice fishing.  Also keep in mind some people see ice fishing as a social event more than an actual fishing trip.  Not everyone is a serious fisherman.
549608,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 00:26:00,0,"i'm with cram.  i don't bring a bunch of beer fishing. typically it's 1 or 2 for an entire day, and none if it's cold out. but there's very few passive activities that aren't better when you're having a beer. i'll take my fine when i get caught and i'll be seeing the JofP shortly after. "
549610,skeeter,2011-02-10 00:30:00,1907,"If a person comes out to my hut with a couple of beers, and he's staying for the day, i dont have a problem with that. if he shows up with a 24, then we have a problem. its called moderation !!"
549617,mercman,2011-02-10 00:42:00,7054,"I hear ya Doc. I dont understand it, dont make it wrong.Unfortunately, the social drinker like you is forced to abide by laws put in place to control the drunken yahoos that smash their skidoos into ice huts at nite, and drive their cars into peoples living rooms under the influence. I must admit though, the Ontario Liquour laws are really weird.Cant drink unless there is a kitchen and a place to cook Cant drink on your front porch of your houseetc etc......  Sounds like an uptite little community goin on over there"
549629,Cookslav,2011-02-10 01:06:00,1457," Personally I'll have a bevy or two when out on the ice...and in some cases I've had lots But bare in mind I'm walking out to the hut and and I'm walking back to the cabin at the end of the day. My car keys hit the rack Friday night, and stay there till Sunday Evening. And None of us have nor need a Machine to get where we're going.  Sometimes I'm out solo and I stick to coffee. But though the winter I head out with the Boys once or twice and we yuk it up somthing awfull but there is no harm done  We're just shooting the crap, playing cards, and having a ball the way we like to do it. Its really more of an On Ice Poker Tourney with a slight chance of catching fish If I got fined I'd gladly pay it just because I know I've gotten away with it for years lol..."
549631,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 01:08:00,0,"  Look at it like speeding.  If you don't have a history of ""speeding"" tickets, and you're not going 30-50 over, often people are given the benefit of the doubt and let off with a warning.  I think liquor fines should be no different.  Unfortunately, on the select days the MNR/OPP put officers in the field in my area, they are under pressure to issue tickets and discretion goes out the window.  If someone is out on their 700cc with 8 beers in their blood, throw the book at them but I'm not a criminal."
549638,mercman,2011-02-10 01:18:00,7054," So lobby your Gov to change the liquor laws.Personally, i think that as long as you are not driving or will be driving while drinking, there should be no restricting laws other than age. After all, alchohol is a legal DRUG."
549640,Cookslav,2011-02-10 01:22:00,1457, I don't have time to get to the beer store most weekends let alone fight the man But yes sir I'd sign that petition
549645,fishing n autograph,2011-02-10 01:33:00,2540," yes legalized, not decriminalized...big difference"
549646,mercman,2011-02-10 01:34:00,7054,"  Cripes.... here in Quebec, we can get Beer and wine right next to the milk and butter in the grocery store.The states have the right to bear arms, in quebec we have da right to drink beers"
549648,irishfield,2011-02-10 01:35:00,26272,Kinda like pot now eh Dave.. allowed one or two of those in your pocket now without charges..
549650,fishing n autograph,2011-02-10 01:37:00,2540," contrary to popular belief, all possession of pot is illegal...the only difference is that under 30 grams you don't get you fingerprints taken"
549654,mercman,2011-02-10 01:42:00,7054,"  Heck no !! As it should be, but relaxing the laws governing how, when and where you consume would make it easier to police, and easier for the consumer to avoid unlawfull situations, wouldn't it."
549661,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 01:58:00,0, speaking of a waste of tax dollars...
