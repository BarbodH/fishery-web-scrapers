550330,Dara,2011-02-11 14:09:00,3052,"-24C here this morning....thats called  ""making Ice""  trails are groomed, sun is shining...how does it get any better"
550341,lew,2011-02-11 14:37:00,12766, Unless of course your a person who finds hard water fishing about as entertaining and exciting as watching bowling on TV
550345,aplumma,2011-02-11 14:42:00,6896, March and April better be wearing shorts down here by then...    Art
550359,Dara,2011-02-11 15:10:00,3052,  You need to come visit us up here for real hard water fishing Lew..half the fun is getting there
550362,anders,2011-02-11 15:24:00,1168,-27 without wind right now at 10:24 am...  is it April yet?
550374,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-11 16:21:00,10439," Up here that is called the average temp!!! I tend to do most of my ice fishing at -25 and warmer, although I have been out there when it's 10 or 15 degrees colder. Just not as much fun. At -25 the hut door stays open with the heater on 1/2. When it gets colder than that the door closes and the heater gets put on full. I just don't like the lack of air movement to get the CO out of the hut when it's sealed up, even with the door cracked, windows cracked and vent open I still get hedaches due to the CO in the hut. May have something to do with the 14,000 btu heater though.  My first couple of years up here I would just turn my back to the wind and fish in -25 to -30 but the hut and heater deal is much more comfy.  Oh yeah, current temp is -31 with little to no wind."

550421,Carp,2011-02-11 20:06:00,1488,I don't mind winter. Can't stand extreme heat. 20 degrees celcius is fine. 30 is a nightmare !!!
550440,Billy Bob,2011-02-11 20:41:00,5865, Only a Dufass would buy a boat in January.....everyone knows that...
550479,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-11 21:59:00,10439,  I bought a new camper last February. Saved a ton of $$$$ over buying it come spring.
550485,Billy Bob,2011-02-11 22:05:00,5865,LOL.....I was just picking on Paul....I purchased (ordered) my boat in January 1985...
550549,Joeytier,2011-02-12 00:27:00,3990,"Just got back from icing jumbos in a snowstorm.  If you can't find any fun in that, you've got no pulse."
549902,Pikeslayer,2011-02-10 17:04:00,1443,"  Ummmmm, NO. You've heard of 'strength in numbers' Geoff?? The last thing we all need is introducing one another's wives. Very bad idea"
549989,Rich,2011-02-10 19:41:00,3927,"Absolutely not, I wish there was ice all year round!"
549991,GBW,2011-02-10 19:45:00,8460,I meant so she can teach my wife that fishing is a 9/10 month season too...
549996,mercman,2011-02-10 19:52:00,7054,  oh Geez !!! Ya must be a young buck !!!! Dont ya know thats how it starts??They start yaking about that and before ya know it they start comparing our abilities and disabilities..... Just leave it the way it is my little buddy....PLEASE

550001,mercman,2011-02-10 19:56:00,7054,  just lookin out for yer best intrests bud !!!
550008,Guest gbfisher,2011-02-10 20:15:00,0,"Lew, I've only had enough of ice fishing when there's no ice left that I can walk on. Then it's river fishing until the boat can go in.  It never stops for some Lew.There's still almost two months left.."
550049,Tybo,2011-02-10 22:00:00,1373,Only if it could be Late September early October all year round. Not a big fan of the heat and the BUGS.
550055,aplumma,2011-02-10 22:13:00,6896,You can't get rid of winter fast enough for me now. After Feb starts I am ready to fish when the air is above 50F.   Art
550060,splashhopper,2011-02-10 22:19:00,2931,i was done with winter as soon as the clocks got tuned to bring the darkness on
550092,Joeytier,2011-02-10 23:10:00,3990,"Still well over a month of the hard stuff to go for me.  Get out there, people!"
550131,spincast,2011-02-11 00:17:00,3279,"  ditto - well maybe the 26th. Nice to have a white christmas after that, it can leave with the used wrapping paper."
550133,BUSTER,2011-02-11 00:22:00,1336,   LOL  ...YES
550134,BUSTER,2011-02-11 00:24:00,1336,"Speed river, guelph beside ponds on york@elizabethc st...Skunk"
550139,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-11 00:42:00,10439,"We're just getting to the best part of winter here. March and April are fabulous in YK. Long, sunny and warm days make for some awesome ice fishing times."
550141,Bernie,2011-02-11 00:44:00,3190,I submit that we have winter once every three years. Anyone to second that motion?  Looking forward to dropping this in the water around mid April.  Two more months!
550146,danbouck,2011-02-11 00:48:00,4380, The perfect boat and motor
550150,GBW,2011-02-11 00:51:00,8460,Where are the rod holders for HH's plainer board trolling?
550198,Bernie,2011-02-11 01:58:00,3190,"Thank you Dan, I think I used it more last summer than my glass boat.  GBW, It's difficult to get Joe out of the sleep cabin."
550226,Afraz,2011-02-11 02:42:00,250,"What are you guys talking about - soft-water ?  This year has been the absolute best ice fishing year for me, i have been out more this year then the past 3 years put together.  And i loved every minute of it, i hope this never ends, i can now fish waters that i would previously have no access to.  HURRAY FOR HYDROGEN BONDING"
550283,Jewelbee,2011-02-11 09:35:00,422,"Well, It's freezing where I work and my deck snowbank is a s tall as me, so.............although I like winter and don't mind the cold...bring on the spring!"
550296,bigugli,2011-02-11 11:48:00,6138,"I like all the seasons, but, being a Finn, I'll take my winter over 100F temps any time. Besides, ice wrangling has been great this year."
550311,OhioFisherman,2011-02-11 13:27:00,6623,Certainly! but me and my dog both have enough sense to stay indoors near the woodburner.
550313,Harrison,2011-02-11 13:37:00,2202,"Yes, enuff already.  I miss having sun til late in the evening."
550327,mr blizzard,2011-02-11 14:06:00,1589,"Lew you can never have enough winter. Hard water fishing, sitting on a pail with the wind at your back and icicles on your moustache, it does not get any better. And no line ups at the boat ramp. Our winters are getting wimpy enough as it is. Bring on the minus temps again."
549792,lew,2011-02-10 14:04:00,12766,And are you ready for this ??  Soft water can't come soon enough for me.....  ....howz bout you ??  
549794,irishfield,2011-02-10 14:07:00,26272,I hear yah Lew... but with the current situation I'd rather be not enjoy Winter.. than not enjoying open water!  Other than that.. I'd rather be here..  
549796,lew,2011-02-10 14:15:00,12766,That looks pretty good too Wayne !!
549797,skeeter,2011-02-10 14:15:00,1907,"come on now Lew. if it was summer , you wouldnt see all those dear in your yard. they would be buried deep in the bush. you would be out in the boat spending money on gas and your wife would be home alone."
549802,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-10 14:22:00,4399,I had enough winter on December 22nd!!!
549804,MSBruno,2011-02-10 14:25:00,369,"bring on the pike, NOW, please!!!"
549808,John,2011-02-10 14:26:00,2956,"Absolutely Lew, doesn't get much better than this..   "
549812,Rod Caster,2011-02-10 14:36:00,5784,6 more months of Winter!!!!  The best time of the year is when the temps rise around -5 degrees and there is still tons of ice on the lakes!  I'm starting to think it's not only the water that gets soft...but some of the members...
549815,danbouck,2011-02-10 14:43:00,4380,A month and a half until the boat goes in  
549816,HTHM,2011-02-10 14:43:00,4082,+ temps next week in my parts according to the forecast.
549817,mercman,2011-02-10 14:44:00,7054, NEVER NEVER NEVER buy a new boat in January !!!! Feb and March will last forever if you do....
549818,BUSTER,2011-02-10 14:45:00,1336,UMMMMMmmmmmmmm
549819,danbouck,2011-02-10 14:45:00,4380," Yep, I bought mine in Febuary and had to wait until the end of April to pick it up"
549826,fishing n autograph,2011-02-10 14:57:00,2540,Yes. I'm done with commuting in the snow....bring on the sunshine!
549832,Twocoda,2011-02-10 15:03:00,4130,12 foot high snowbanks just dont seem high enough ...yeah right ..  ...if it would warm up just a bit so my float wouldnt turn to a block of ice..it would make life a bit easier...
549837,Pigeontroller,2011-02-10 15:12:00,2793,Can't wait...  
549845,Rich Clemens,2011-02-10 15:28:00,3131,You guys are killin' me.
549847,bigbuck,2011-02-10 15:31:00,2449,Soft water can't come soon enough!! I've had enough of the cold. I miss being out on the water!!
549855,Leecher,2011-02-10 15:38:00,7832,Nope.... not yet Lew    I love hard water fishing
549861,Pikeslayer,2011-02-10 15:55:00,1443,"Nope, not me. This year I have 'rediscovered' the joys of winter & ice fishing, thanks to a number of members here (you guys know who you are  ). Mrs. Pikeslayer is pretty much resigned to accept that fishing is now officially a 9/10 month season."
549867,Governator,2011-02-10 16:00:00,879,  Were you snagged?  lol  j/k  Looks like heaven.
549887,GBW,2011-02-10 16:29:00,8460,maybe we can get her to talk to my wife then...
549890,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-10 16:37:00,2582,I'm pretty much the opposite of you Lew...I love the icefishing.  However I could do without shoveling snow
549897,mercman,2011-02-10 16:54:00,7054,Well at least with all the snow this winter we may have water levels for normal next summer.They were deadly low here last year.Saw lots of people with busted skegs and props.  
549898,2advanced,2011-02-10 16:56:00,53,I seen humps in the holland river that I never seen before in my life this year lol
