549455,cynmar,2011-02-09 20:36:00,169,"This may seem like a stupid question but what is the best knot to tie your main line to the spool prior to re-spooling your reel. As well, if you have a newer reel with the holes in the spool, do you pass your line through the holes to tie or does it make any difference? I have always just used a slip knot and spooled the line on , however, that base knot does slip around the spool.  Thanks for the info"
549467,ranksda58,2011-02-09 20:57:00,69,"i use the same knot as you, the slip knot, when tying onto the spool and i also go through the holes on my spool  im no expert, but is there even a right or wrong way to do it?"
549471,Roy,2011-02-09 21:04:00,13728,"Use the arbor knot however, if you're spooling braided line, use a little monofilament backing in the spool first then tie the backing to your (braided) mainline."
549502,muddler,2011-02-09 22:03:00,623,"I really don't like wasting line so here's what I've done for years.  Wrap my mono backing 4 or 5 times around the spool and tie off to the mainline with a uni knot. Fill the spool about 40-50 % with the backing and then splice the running line (usually about 60-70 yds)on with two uni knots.  The backing is  any mono that is a bit heavier than my mainline or in the case of braid I use 12-15 lb mono as a backing.  I have only had one fish take me to my backing ever when fishing walleye.bass, pike or musky.  Steelhead and salmon in the rivers is a bit different in that I use dacron backing and about 150 yards of mainline.  I get more fresh line changes that way when I buy a new line.  For example my walleye rod has 10lb Stren(the old blue UV one) as a backing and then I splice on the 8lb line. When I need to change to fresh line I just strip of the 8lb to the uni knot and replace that portion. Always fill to 1/8 inch of the lip.   muddler"
