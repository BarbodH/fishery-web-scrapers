I hope you all are having a great hardwater season, I know I have been. I've been out on Rainy River almost everday for the past week, fishing mainly walleye. Ice is good and thick, over 14-16"" for most spots, although the main chanel is still open water.  Anyhow, I want to get involved in the tournement this year, and I had to do a post like this to be added to the waiting list, so forgive me, haha.  Anyone heading to rainy river to fish at all this hardwater season? Feel free to drop me a message if you need a partner"

549753,manitoubass2,2011-02-10 05:17:00,11391,"Many thanks!  Now if only the fish had been biting better I would have had a great day. -41 out on the ice today, I lasted 4 hours, and it was tough"
549761,SlowPoke,2011-02-10 12:08:00,2984, Now THAT is dedication!
549911,manitoubass2,2011-02-10 17:15:00,11391,"lol, yeah, the weather usually won't keep me from fishing. It was a slow day though, only 4 walleye and all around 12"". Then again, the mornings and evenings are usually much better than day time, but I needed to scratch the itch.  It was also very windy, so that didnt make it any easier. I broke off on what felt like a sturgeon, took me about 5 minutes to re tie, lol"
550051,splashhopper,2011-02-10 22:04:00,2931, if minus 41 is tough...what is considered easy up there?
550162,manitoubass2,2011-02-11 01:04:00,11391," about -15 is nice and cozi. I went out for awhile today and it was -21, good enough to not wear gloves or a jacket for a couple hours. Sun was shining and no wind though"
