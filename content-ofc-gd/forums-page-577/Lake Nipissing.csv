550523,bobowski,2011-02-11 23:20:00,360,The Guys and I are going to South River Resort on Lake Nipissing for the weekend at the end of the month.We are staying in a 6 man Ice Cabin. Can anyone who has been there tell me if they had a good experience and if there is anything unique to this resort that we should bring with us? Any help would be much appreciated.
