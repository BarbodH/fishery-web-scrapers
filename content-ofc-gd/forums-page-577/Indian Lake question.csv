549433,seanik,2011-02-09 19:10:00,38,"I flew in to Indian Lake with Sudbury aviation about 7 years ago. There were 2 other outfitters on Indian Lake at that time. The Northern cabin belonged to Lakeland Airways out of Temagami, the cabin just North of Sudburys belonged to a fellow named Blake and he was from Wawa or somewhere South of Indian. If I remember correctly there was another cabin privately owned. There is a bay just right of the Northly cabin that has a stream running into it from another Lake. The stream requires a bit of hard work to access this small lake but well worth the effort. One disappointment about Indian was the access over the Southern dam, we found at least 20 boats cached and many campers from the cache camped on the Islands. Indian Lake fishing at that time was below average but I hear there is a slot limit and things have improved.  Hope this helps Seanik"
