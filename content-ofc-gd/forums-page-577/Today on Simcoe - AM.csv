549216,icefisherman,2011-02-09 00:55:00,952,"Yep that is right...it is been a while since I managed to get Simcoe laker on the ice but today I did... Started earlier with more reasonable walking distance this time...and we were fishing by 8am...took a while for the fish to wake up but when it did we did most of the damage between 9:00 and 9:45am both Williams and Meegs worked well...the laker hit a Meegs lure.......88 fow... And it was super cold...very bad wind...still a lot of slush beds though I've notice the ice got thicker...some are parking on the ice. On the way home by Noon...still a nice day with good friends and lot of laughs...  RickOnt thanks again for pulling that sled for the last ""mile"" sure made a difference just walking and not having anything in our hands Hope we manage to go out next week with you...  Because of technical difficulties I don't have the pictures but Chuck will try posting them in reply to this post.  Fish smoking time again tomorrow  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
