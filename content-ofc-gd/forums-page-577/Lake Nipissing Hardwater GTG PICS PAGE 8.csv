549393,Spiel,2011-02-09 16:22:00,9065,"Thanks for the report all. Looks like a good time, perhaps next year will favour me and I'll be able to participate."
549400,NAW,2011-02-09 17:04:00,4022," Ya..  I didn't want to say anything to stir the pot. But I caught that big eye outta the whole Randy was fishing from all day..  If Randy wasn't so busy cooking dogs all day, he would have caught a lot more fish for sure!"
549600,Joeytier,2011-02-10 00:09:00,3990,I won't hold it against him.
549611,Muskieman,2011-02-10 00:30:00,2472,  and I was only fishing from one hole 'til 1:30... NAW was kind enough to open another one up for me. It didn't help   Randy 
548199,BassAsin,2011-02-06 05:09:00,806,"sounds like a great time was had by all. Wish i could have made it, had to work 7 am to 11pm on  a transport rollover on hwy 11 N       regardless of being able to make it or not thank you kindly for the invite.  Matt"
548200,Nipfisher,2011-02-06 05:14:00,2449,"It was super to meet new board members today. At the GTG was: T.J. Randy From Sturgeon Lady Walleye (Shelley) Rodcaster (Chad) and his girlfriend Sara Spud7378 (Kevin) NAW (Nick) Jocko (Hans) and his friend Harv Rides85 (Andrew) Joeytier (Joey) and his friend (joining the board SOON) and myself  It was a great day to be out on the lake and although fishing could have been better the bites were fairly constant through the day.      We had a snack of fried fish     Randy brought his special friend   Joeytier caught the only 2 walleyes of the day.   and I tried my best to fish like Limeyangler but only managed herring and perch.   Congratulations to NAW who took home $15 for the most fish caught. He also one a free nights accomodations in my hut tonight. He texted me and will have a cell phone picture of the 25"" HOG walleye he caught tonight around 10pm. It was released.   We never did measure the herring but at the end of the day we figure Jocko's friend Harv caught the biggest one. We had a good pike through the hole but it broke off and went back down.  Once again, thanks to all who made it out I had a great day."
548201,Nipfisher,2011-02-06 05:16:00,2449,It would have been great to have you out there today Matt. We'll hook up sometime.
548204,Joeytier,2011-02-06 05:44:00,3990,I should learn to open my eyes.  I had a feeling Nick would pop a good fish out there. Nice shootin
548220,spud7378,2011-02-06 12:55:00,68,"great to meet everyone yesterday, even know i did only contribute 4 fish all day! thanks again to blair for putting together the day and randy for the cooking! and tj for the great prizes! had a great time!"
548272,Muskieman,2011-02-06 15:34:00,2472,"I sure was fun!!!.... Nice meeting everyone... I must apologize for only catching 1 measly Perch , but it was fun anyway.  I thought that I took tons of pics but turns out that I took 37 fuzzy 1 second videos  Rod Caster, do you have that Artie in the snowsuit picture available."
548288,b.cote,2011-02-06 15:50:00,1,"Hey guys,  Im Brendan, the guy who came out with Joeytier. Saturday was a great day on the ice. Thaks to everyone for coming out and especially to Blair for the top notch hospitality!. It was great to meet everyone!  Here are a few pictures from saturday.  Joey with his trophy of the day    My two fish of the day    The hut    First time driving on the ice! "
548291,Rod Caster,2011-02-06 15:55:00,5784,"  Yes I have that photo, I'll post it here in the next...well, soon. Just got home from Loring. Sooooo much fishing in the past 48 hrs and I plan on hitting the shack again tonight.  Thanks to Blair and TJ and all the participants! Sarah and I had a great time. I'll post my photos later today. How did the Herring taste and how did you guys cook it???? Very interested in knowing whether they are worth keeping next time. Congrats to Joeytier on the two walleye!!! You spanked everyone hahaha."
548293,kickingfrog,2011-02-06 15:59:00,8333,"Hey guys, glad you got together and got some fish. Being from Nord Bay originally, I would have liked to make it.  I wonder if a separate post should be started to post the photos from the day? Some of the other members may not think to check the OP to see photos."
548298,Roy,2011-02-06 16:07:00,13728, I edited the subject Rob. Will that help?
548302,Joeytier,2011-02-06 16:25:00,3990,"Rod Caster, I had a few chunks of the herring and was pretty impressed.  It's similar in texture to whitefish, just a little more oily and fishy."
548305,TJQ,2011-02-06 16:27:00,7806,It was great to get out and see everyone!! Ill have some pictures shortly!!
548431,NAW,2011-02-06 21:49:00,4022," Swag..  I've always wanted some OFC swag..  Big thanks to TJ for dropping that stuff off!  And thanks Blair for setting things up, and letting me use the shack for the night.  It was great to pull a nice hog through the ice.  Measured it at almost 25"", and figure it was about 5lbs.  Big fat belly.  My batteries ran dead on my camera, so I only have 1 decent picture, and that's of me.  The nighttime cell phone / flashlight picture of the walleye didn't turn our good at all.  I tried to get my foot in there for a comparison..  She looks a little rough, but she swam off strong..      And of coarse the swag!. "
548478,Rod Caster,2011-02-07 00:04:00,5784,Here are my select pics from the G2G. Randy's deer head is FREAKY!!! hahaha  Somebody got stuck right at the ice shack...heavy snow drifts everywhere    Randy and the shack    My GF jigging her heart out. haha    Randy getting in touch with the wildlife gods    Blair checking his line    Me with  a hering     Again...great times!
548488,BUSTER,2011-02-07 00:32:00,1336," Really wish i was able to make it, looks like everyone had a blast.."
548533,limeyangler,2011-02-07 03:20:00,5204,  AWESOME GLOVES BLAIR!!!!!!!  fantastic GTG people...love all the pictures...Randy...that deer head is freakin' weird and scary....love it.  So many different stories....great read.  GOOD TIMES!
548663,Nipfisher,2011-02-07 14:50:00,2449,"Probably the last post for this thread then we can let it die. I was back out at the hut yesterday from 11:30 - 4:30 and had wayyy too much to drink. I caught 13"" walleye and a buddy caught a 22.5"" pike. We caught lots of perch but only kept a few for a snack in the hut. No pictures."
548681,NAW,2011-02-07 15:55:00,4022, Speaking of way to much to drink.  If you catch a brand new mag light in that area.  let me know..
548682,Rod Caster,2011-02-07 16:08:00,5784,"  Bahahaha. Reminds me of the rod holder I lost, the jigging rod I broke, the sweater I forgot on Sat night....Next time I drink and fish I'm bringing NOTHING with me, especially if in the dark."
548698,Jonny,2011-02-07 17:17:00,1380,"Swag? There was swag?  Left too soon I guess. Ah, well, maybe next time.  On another note, the Steelers lost. Green Bay's got a great team though, and you gotta love Aaron Rodgers."
548916,Nipfisher,2011-02-08 02:05:00,2449,"  Nick, didn't I tell you to use the head lamp? Which hole did it go down? I may try a big magnet I have."
549018,NAW,2011-02-08 13:33:00,4022," If you walk straight out the door of the hut, it's the first whole you will come to..  About 20' from the hut.."
549037,Jonny,2011-02-08 14:43:00,1380," Unfortunately, Mag-Lite's are made of aluminum, so that won't work.   "
549182,Shelley Cooper,2011-02-08 23:40:00,394,"Hahahah Great stories Guys... I have a few pic's to add too, but I'm still on the road, as soon as I'm home, I'll get them up here...  I thought that Herring tasted just like a little white fish... first time I ever tried herring...  Thanks again Blair and everyone for a great day..."
549199,Shelley Cooper,2011-02-09 00:18:00,394,"  Naw.. it was nice meeting you... but don't be so bashful.. He forgot to mention he threw a lot more fish back then is seen... and he got that big walleye in Randy's ONE"" perch hOLE .. LOL <love teasing>  It was fun watchin you catch fish after fish...  Great day forsure.."
547592,BUSTER,2011-02-04 04:11:00,1336,Cant leave the children at home alone
547686,Nipfisher,2011-02-04 15:57:00,2449, If you can make it PM NAW for the accomodations. Maybe you two could split the room and save some cash? I am open to someone (up to 2 people) spending the night in my hut. It is warm and you would be the guinnea pig....oops...I mean first to try out the new beds. Maybe catch a biggun over night?
547691,NAW,2011-02-04 16:07:00,4022," I would love to overnight it in your hut.  I'll bring bells for my rod, and a bottle of scotch!  Sign me up for that.  For sure!"

547784,NAW,2011-02-04 18:51:00,4022, My wife makes home made baileys every christmass too!
547821,Jonny,2011-02-04 20:45:00,1380,"Harv and I will be at the Callander dock at 9 AM in the morning. But like I PM'ed you Nip, I can only stay till about noon. Family plans came up that mean I can't stay the whole day as I would like.  We'll have a chance to wet some lines for a couple of hours and meet some of the guys anyway."
547894,rides85,2011-02-05 00:25:00,37,"Hey guys as it stands now i wont likly make it tomorrow not feeling all that great today, if i feel better later in the day tomorrow i will try to swing out."

548092,Shelley Cooper,2011-02-06 00:13:00,394,"No postings on our day yet?? wow, you guys are slow... lol  It was a great day on Nip... even the weather cooperated..... and I'd like to thank Randy for getting me out on the ice..

548123,Joeytier,2011-02-06 01:15:00,3990,"Big thanks to Blair for the excellent hospitality (and the beer)  and of course TJ for the awesome swag (currently enjoying my mug).  The fishing was good, and the company was even better.  Always nice to meet OFC'ers"

548148,Jonny,2011-02-06 02:10:00,1380,"Harv and I enjoyed the outing and meeting you folks, even though we could only stay till noon. Would be nice to join something like this again some time when other things don't conflict.  Thanks for the effort in putting this all together, Blair.    "
548150,Jonny,2011-02-06 02:12:00,1380,A few more pics...    
548156,Joey,2011-02-06 02:26:00,9122,Excellent     Looks like a great time had by all.  Glad you made it Shelley  Joey
545700,Bernie,2011-01-31 03:33:00,3190,"OK, fair enough. Not sure what is up yet next weekend but I might stop by to say hello."
546050,Nipfisher,2011-01-31 21:09:00,2449,5 more sleeps. Weather system looks like it will be good to us and finally get some lower pressure.
546054,Roy,2011-01-31 21:18:00,13728,"Shaping up really good for you guys! Good luck and those of you who are in our tournament, don't forget your OFC signs!"
546060,Joeytier,2011-01-31 21:46:00,3990,"Hey guys, haven't really frequented OFC much over the past few months, but I'll be out fishing on Callander Saturday anyway, so I may as well keep a look out for you guys.  Forecast is looking promising so far."
546103,duckdog,2011-01-31 23:55:00,162,"I will move my hut later this week close to nipfisher's, please sing my guest book, I will leave it in the hut, sorry nipfisher I have not had time to get back to you, how close do you want the hut?"
546158,Muskieman,2011-02-01 01:59:00,2472,I CCCCant friggin' wait!!
546184,Nipfisher,2011-02-01 02:44:00,2449, Any where behind or to the west of my shack.
546195,Joeytier,2011-02-01 03:14:00,3990,The long range is holding up nicely.  Looking forward to getting out.  Post-ice meet-up for a pint or two in Callander?
546206,Nipfisher,2011-02-01 03:29:00,2449, There will be some adult bevys on the ice. But I may be convinced into a drink from a local establishment.
546312,Nipfisher,2011-02-01 15:00:00,2449,I placed an order today for 1.5 pounds of shiners. There should be about 10-12 dozen shiners in a pound. With about 15-20 anglers this should make us good for mins.  Thank you to Discount Bait and Tackle on Trout Lake Rd. for the great deal on the minnows.
546646,Nipfisher,2011-02-02 01:46:00,2449,Minnows are on order and the weather is looking good.
546650,Rod Caster,2011-02-02 01:50:00,5784,  Figured I'd repost this.
546652,irishfield,2011-02-02 01:51:00,26272, Make sure someone comes with you and you keep them seperate!! You can't possess more than 10 dozen without a collectors licence.
546658,Nipfisher,2011-02-02 01:55:00,2449, Yep thanks Wayne we have that covered. Spud7378 will be my driver as I'm thinking I won't be in driving condition by the end of the day.
547111,Mike01,2011-02-02 23:30:00,378,"Sorry guys, some family obligations came up and I won't be able to make it.  I might try and swing by towards the end of the day and see how everyone made out."
547240,Nipfisher,2011-02-03 03:43:00,2449, Sorry to hear that Mike01. My hut will be out on C-Bay all season. OFNers welcome anytime.  Loving the new forecast. High of -2. Whoooo-hoooo. That's almost t-shirt weather.
547284,Muskieman,2011-02-03 12:48:00,2472,48 Hours to go!!!
547315,Rod Caster,2011-02-03 14:56:00,5784, Is that it? Is it -5 degrees yet?
547459,Rod Caster,2011-02-03 23:31:00,5784,Looks like the wind forecast has changed from 5 to 10 kph.... are we still going ahead with the G2G?  
547467,Muskieman,2011-02-03 23:56:00,2472,  We sure are .. that's a 6Mph wind. My contraption just might work ! ..
547570,Nipfisher,2011-02-04 03:36:00,2449,It looks like at least 13 board members will make it out if work cooperates? Maybe a few suprise guests ???? T.J. ????? Bernie ????  Randy From Sturgeon Rodcaster Nipfisher Smarty Pantz? NAW LucG? Average Joe Fishing? Rides85 Spud7378 Buster? Bassasin Lady Walleye = Mystery member Jocko Old Harv Joeytier (sorry)  Temps are still forcasted to to be -3. Some wind and some flurries but all is good. I'll have some fresh coffee perkolating in the hut for the morning portion of the day. Looks like we will have everything we need for a great event. Thanks to Spud7378 I'll be able to enjoy a few beverages INSIDE my hut and he will get me home safe.
547578,BUSTER,2011-02-04 03:51:00,1336,"I'm 90% OUT. I'd have to come up friday night grab a room and spend saturday night in a room leave early sunday morn approx 3.5hr drive home for superbowl...If i go it'll be last minute decision .  Dam car has a shake in the front end I'll have to check out too..maybe a wheel weight lost, bad tire..not sure. I'll try tire rotation tomorrow.. Still want to go tho....lol  Party up with Nip and the boyz I mean serious fishing   with the boys."
547580,irishfield,2011-02-04 03:52:00,26272,Read that to say he hasn't got Shenia's permission yet !!
547584,BUSTER,2011-02-04 04:00:00,1336,"LOL,  the last thing this cat does is ask. The main reason I've stayed with her since I was 26 is she doesn't say no, 11  years and not once has she said NO Happily Unmarried to a 49 yr old!!!"
547587,irishfield,2011-02-04 04:05:00,26272,"Yah.. ""10-4 good buddy.. but yah better be home before I go to work"" LOL"
543621,BUSTER,2011-01-26 01:57:00,1336,I'd pay for that.
543659,Nipfisher,2011-01-26 02:58:00,2449," Buster if you can make it up here, I'll make sure you have a place to fish out of. That goes for all OFNers (just not all at once)."
543695,AverageJoeFishing,2011-01-26 05:12:00,70,"I got some bad news today... I thought my splint was coming off today, but it will only be in another 2 weeks   ... But i'll still try to go for a visit.  If i can't go Goodluck to all you guys... If I'd be fishing for a living i would'nt of hurt myself lol"
543869,Nipfisher,2011-01-26 19:17:00,2449,  Man down. Would be great if you still came out for a visit. Maybe you should drive for Randy? That way he can really enjoy himself.
543871,Muskieman,2011-01-26 19:23:00,2472, There's an Idea!!
543990,BUSTER,2011-01-26 23:28:00,1336,"I'am still debating but thanks much for the   offer, I'll know more as we get closer to the date, I'd have to be back for superbowl tho"
544046,Nipfisher,2011-01-27 01:40:00,2449,"Superbowl is a definate. I'll be heading out to the shack Friday night to make sure everything is ready. Saturday at 9am we'll meet at the launch, I'll fish until dark. Sunday me and some buddies are having a Superderb from 11 am - 3 pm (longest fish wins) then a cab from the ice to a buddies place for the game. I took Monday off so after the kids are at daycare / school I'll be back out on the ice. Considering a nearby lake for Lakers. Tuesday - Thursday will be detoxing."
544058,BUSTER,2011-01-27 01:57:00,1336,
544151,BassAsin,2011-01-27 05:54:00,806,unless i get called into work i'll be in. i'll bring the good looks good humour and a few more dogs and buns.
544535,Nipfisher,2011-01-28 02:57:00,2449,It looks like at least 13 board members will make it out if work cooperates?  Randy From Sturgeon Rodcaster Nipfisher Smarty Pantz NAW LucG? Average Joe Fishing? Rides85 Spud7378 Mike01 Duckdog? Buster? Bassasin Mystery member   I know of at least 6 friends of members that will also be attending. I have some fishing buddies from the Ontario Out of Doors Community that may drop in for visits. Mike01 and Spud 7378 will have portables...who else? There is plenty of room around the shack and we can use mine as H.Q. / kitchen / washroom. Mike01 said he'd bring his auger (gas?) and I'll have my Jiffy with lots of gas. In my shack I'll have my oil furnace with cook top and a 2 burner propane stove. Randy is bringing the bar-b-q. I'll have the cooking oil and Fish Crisp and a small frying pan for some on-ice fish frying. I'll make every effort to get us enough minnows for everyone. I'll collect for bait on the ice so bring a little cash. You can drive right to my hut but no sense in having a bunch of vehicles out there. So after the first group goes out at 9am I'll take a few runs to get every body there or at least your gear and you can walk out.  Any questions just ask here or PM me. I'll have a bunch of extra lines and tip-ups too. Here is the long range forcast. Looks really fishable.  Long Range Forcast
544573,Jonny,2011-01-28 04:22:00,1380,"Thanks for the PM invite, Nip!  Sounds great.  Old Harv and I will drive out to the spot with a truck if we can make it. (Snow conditions are good for a vehicle so far, I gather.)  Chances look very good, so count us in barring a message to the contrary.  We've got an Eskimo Quickfish portable, a gas auger, and all the gear necessary to set up comfy."

I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.  1) Has anyone been out yet?  2) How was the bite?	Myself and a few buddies will be staying in the ice bungalows put out by Anglers Haven and are hoping to have some action!   Thanks in advance."

545305,Nipfisher,2011-01-30 00:13:00,2449," Great Mike01, We should have about 5 augers between the group. Probably drill 30-40 holes through 20+ inches of ice. It is a pretty easy drive out to the shack today. we can use the trucks to get the gear out to the shack. Then take some back to the landing."
545306,Nipfisher,2011-01-30 00:18:00,2449, I PM'd you RathrBFishn.
545333,inkslinger11,2011-01-30 01:48:00,9,Thanx Nipfisher. Got it.
545635,Nipfisher,2011-01-31 01:46:00,2449,Update from todays trip to the hut.  Bad news is...not much of a bite after 4:30.  Good news is....perch should keep us busy from 9-12 and 2-4:30.  Last 2 trips have not produced a single walleye. I'll leave the hut where it is for now and move it after the gtg. At least we are in a decent perch spot. With the # of anglers and 2 holes each we should be able to cover a good area and hopefully the walleye cooperate. The long term forecast looks terrific with a high of -4 and a low of -12. The pressure should be lower and some light snow is expected.  Forecast  There is an excellent road right to my hut. It will be an aesy ride out and in with the vehicles. I'm super excited about next Saturday and I'll try and keep this thread current.
545682,Bernie,2011-01-31 02:43:00,3190,Any of you fellas going to bring an FRS radio? Just in case I get a chance to pop by.

If you drive over we will be out in front of the launch (gov. dock) just off to the left. When you get on the lake there are 3 well-traveled roads. The centre one will lead you right ot my shack.

I will bring my gas auger and I will probably have my big hut there as a resting place (it has a bathroom in it Randy). No hot dogs for you! We will be directly in front of the launch about 10  minutes out by foot. There will be tons of ice so I will also have my truck there. I may bring the old sled too. Family, friends, and kids are welcome but I am not a babysitter.  Randy, Yes it is where they store the Cheif Commanda. Please bring the bar-b-q. I'll have my Serious Radio for tunes.

The closest hotel is Terrace Suites but that is alot of cash. Next closest is Pinewood Park (Clarion Resort) but it is expensive too. The closest cheaper hotel is the ""peeler"" Bar Moe-ze-on Inn (705) 494-4915.  My suggestion is one of these two places. Arizona Motel 705-472-0800 1078 Lakeshore Drive North Bay, ON http://www.arizonamotelnorthbay.com/ or The Lincoln Motel 705-472-3231 594 Lakeshore Drive North Bay, ON. http://www.lincolnmotel.net/ Both are less than 10 minutes from where we will be fishing and are affordable and comfortable."

There is alot of space behind the shack for portables. There is about 15"" of ice under us and we are in 26.7 feet of water. Neighboring shacks today caught up to 30 perch and there were a few walleye caught. It is tough fishing with the blistering cold wind and high pressure. If the weather cooperates for us on the 5th, so will the fish."
542979,Nipfisher,2011-01-24 02:40:00,2449,"I went back out today and did a little scouting around the shack. We are in 27 fow and there is a slope going down to 30 fow to the deep side of the shack. There will be lots of room for portables. Less then 3 hours today and Perch bite was non-stop. We landed 6 (5 perch and 1 eye) and lost several on the way up. We also got stipped alot because the holes froze over instantly, and we were inside the warm shack"

543618,Nipfisher,2011-01-26 01:52:00,2449, You are probably too shallow. Try 28-30 fow and you'll get perch steady. Walleye bite is between 8 am and 11 am and then around 3:30 - 5pm.  I sent you a PM Nelson.
