We went to Nipissing last year but found it a bit crowded for what we were loooking for and , after doing some research, I think that if we are willing to travel a bit farther, we can get into some phenomenal fishing. Right now I am looking at the gogama region and I am heavily favoring the Shooting Star camp. However, I have never fished the area before and would love to get some feedback on the lodge in particular or the area in general.  A couple of restrictions for us.  Serious isolation is not possible. I will be the only adult with a 12 and 10 year old. The 12 yr old has his boaters card so some distatnce is ok but not more than 2 miles from a main lodge.  I have to foot the whole bill so total cost for all of us for a week cannot exceed $900.  I live just south of Hamilton and our max drive time is 8-9 hours.   So, anyone have any great suggestions for a lodge. Any feedback on the Shooting Star camp?   Thanks fellas!   Chris"
548996,adempsey,2011-02-08 06:48:00,1498,"Never been to that camp.  Have some places you can check out that I marked when I was doing some research.   Can't really offer much information since I have not been to them.   Many were recommendations from various internet forums though.  These are all in the Chapleau region and I think may meet your financial requirements depending on how and if they discount for children.  http://www.chapleaulodge.com/ http://www.kanipahow.com/ http://www.fivemilelake.com http://www.bigbearcamp.ca/ http://www.horwoodoutpost.com/ http://www.moosehorn.net http://www.duenorth.net/prairiebeecamps/ http://www.murraylake.net/index.html  Don't overlook Quebec either.  Lots of great fishing to be had up there.  I might be headed there for my annual trip this year.  I am working hard to visit as many places as I can, but haven't gotten very far yet.  So, hopefully this helps you a bit even if I couldn't offer any first hand experience.  Cheers!"

Fishing - main lake has enough hammer heads to keep you entertained for a while but you will eventually make the hike to the river then never fish the main lake again.  In the river you will catch plenty of Walleye, and Bass and the odd pike.  The water level dropped 4 feet (not exagerating, the docks were dry) while we were there then the fishing shut down, before that I would say it was excellent fishing.  Caution - your comment about not too remote might exclude this place, train, then boat to your cabin.  You are alone with the bears out there.  I am not sure about their other cabins..  If you want more details shoot me a PM......."
549282,Dara,2011-02-09 03:18:00,3052,Skip Moosehorn. You have to drive everywhere to fish. The owners will tell you about lakes down the road but aren't much help. They say there are no fish in the lake the lodge is on but thats because they don't want customers fishing there.
549285,chris.brock,2011-02-09 03:32:00,4053,"In that area, Ray's Camp on Ramsey Lk is good (been there), Shooting Star sounds interesting (never been there), or Grey Owl or Ritchies End Of Trail on Bisco are decent (been to Bisco), the Horwwood Lk places sound interesting too (never been there but would like to try it)  Also, been to Happy Day Lodge, great people/ place but tough fishing, nice scenery on a big lake though  Ray's Camp on Ramsey would be my choice if good fishing for walleye is important"

549913,NBR,2011-02-10 17:18:00,163,Never been to Shooting Star but unless I missed something you are going to burst your budget! 
549969,solopaddler,2011-02-10 19:04:00,8605," Not really. His rate is $550, the 10 year old is free and the 12 year old is half price.  That's considerably less than $900.  As Chris already recommended I'd go to Ray's camp on Ramsey lake, nice camp, good walleye fishing, and roughly the same drive as Shooting Star."
550026,davew3,2011-02-10 20:58:00,430,Check out this place.  Just north of North bay.  It has regular cabins and out cabins a couple of miles away. Usually the older gent stays at the north camp.  http://www.duenorth.net/temagamiriverside  Regards
