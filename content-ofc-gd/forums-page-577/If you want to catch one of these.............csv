We'll spend dusk or dawn (prime bite) tracking kings & cohos. During 'sun up' we'll be fishing the 'bluezone' & chasing rainbow. If anyone has any questions, you can pm me or post them here. If you're going to place a bid, you need to do so at this link;  http://www.ofncommun...showtopic=50839  Pikeslayer"
