It's been around a few years, but it's a wonder no one got to work on it earlier. NF, btw.... ""]http://www.engineeringtv.com/video/Opposed-Piston-Opposed-Cylinder"
549941,Old Man,2011-02-10 18:24:00,822,"Interesting concept. I wonder with it being 2 stroke piston ported engine, whether it can meet the emission standards for automobiles?  By the way, the link didn't work for me. Here it is again.  http://www.engineeri...pposed-Cylinder"

For the trade off of fuel economy and 4x the power from the same mass I'm sure they'll try."
550043,Tybo,2011-02-10 21:47:00,1373,Most of this new engineering for engines you here about isn't new! The fuels that they need was not ready available so the project got shelved.
550128,Muskieman,2011-02-11 00:07:00,2472,Extension of older technology..  It reminds me of the 'ol Doxford engines with 2 crankshafts.. Amazing HP and torque... limited applications though.  Very cool concept using one crank...  I wouldn't expect this engine in any upcoming vehicle line up.  But a variation could easily apply to small engines..30*-45* V-Twin maybe...It would depend on RPM's vs HP /LBS/Torque..I'd guess.
