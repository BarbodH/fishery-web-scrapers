549637,fishindude,2011-02-10 01:15:00,220,"That's awesome, the video quality is superb dude  Would love to know what software he's using as he seems to be putting these vids together with ease, I have a bit of experience with Adobe Premiere but looking for something simpler than that; but more technical than Movie Maker, PM me if that's easier  Cheers"
