Moose and Deer season went by in a flash, saw one buck, no shot. Not a single moose was spotted in the whopping 3 days I had time to hunt the big buggers.  Bought one of these to extend my hunting season and fend off the cabin fever...    Been hunting for those stupid bug eyed green trout through the ice...only got 2, 4 pounders under my belt, along with about 4 million pike    Even managed to get up into LSPP for 2 days. I didn't fair well with only 3 pan sized specks and a lost ""nice one"" at the hole. My fishin partner wrangled this nice Laker out though along with another slightly smaller one the next day....in 5 feet of water ...       So thats been my fall/winter so far. I'm taking February off to buy an HDS-7 and some more rods/reels/tackle that I'll need for the upcoming Walleye season."

550024,TDunn,2011-02-10 20:55:00,680,"Nice! Beauty laker forsure. Tried to get up to LSPP yesterday but the OPP had a road block at Heyden due to the weather. I wonder how much snow the park was nailed with... Heyden had a fresh, foot of snow at 5:30am yesterday!  TDunn"

Thats an 09' Admiral.   There was close to 2 feet in there last weekend...definitely gonna be snowshoe territory from here on out"
550069,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 22:27:00,0," anders might be able to verify this, but wawa got literally nothing when we got hammered yesterday... they're starting to get it today though, and tomorrow looks like they'll get hit.  i was gonna head up there saturday, but with the snow coming i think i'll just sit my butt on the ski doo instead."
