549396,hammercarp,2011-02-09 16:29:00,964,Too busy to stop to eat. Not only urbanites eat on the go I guess. 
549397,cram,2011-02-09 16:40:00,1733, Very cool. Is that from hamilton harbor?
549399,hammercarp,2011-02-09 16:46:00,964,No. Like I said I got the picture off another forum. We do have a pair here and we get a bunch that stop for a few days in March before heading north across the lake.
549411,Twocoda,2011-02-09 17:59:00,4130,awesome image!!! i wasnt aware there was another forum..

549524,irishfield,2011-02-09 22:23:00,26272,Now if we could just increase the Bald Eagle population....
549538,splashhopper,2011-02-09 22:43:00,2931,amazing pic
549582,hammercarp,2011-02-09 23:45:00,964,Maybe you guys should switch to the osprey as it seems to have much more refined tastes. Koi can cost tens of thousands of dollars. 
549589,solopaddler,2011-02-09 23:49:00,8605,  That's not a Koi. It's an Aurora trout in full spawning colours.
549834,Rich,2011-02-10 15:08:00,3927,My buddy Bottombouncer often tells the story fishing a quarry pond last year he saw a bald eagle dive and take off with like a 6lb carp in it's yap. Cool pic !
549859,Leecher,2011-02-10 15:43:00,7832,Awesome shot
549940,shane,2011-02-10 18:22:00,652,"Cool pic.  I remember one day sitting on the riverbank not catching anything when we saw an osprey land in a dead tree across the river from us. He sat up there for a bit then, all of a sudden, he swooped down into the river with a big splash and then comes up with a 1 or 2 lb.  fish (looked like a sucker). Then!! He flew right by us, about twenty feet away, holding this fish in his claws and looking me right in the eye. I swear he was sticking his tongue out at me."
549952,tb4me,2011-02-10 18:40:00,3295,"We have a Osprey nesting box right above our dock.. They truely are amazing birds. I wish I had a better lens for my DSLR..the Kawartha Osprey are truely one of natures beautifull sights. If your ever in Havelock go to marions bait and tackle. He has a mounted and stuffed Golden eagle he caught in a fox snare in the early 70's over the worm fridge..That bird is HUGE.  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""480"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/i-zXmydeI9A"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
