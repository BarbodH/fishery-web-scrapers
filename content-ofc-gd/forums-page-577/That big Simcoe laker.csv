I finaly found it,  For those that dont know the story,I,ll try and tell ya to the best of my memory will allow. When I had my 14 ft Sylvan tinny,I always downed rigged off the 9th line of Oro. One day I decided to troll all the way back to shore and as the depths got shallower,I would just raise the ball. I got to 45 fow and the rod when for a deep dive. After  a lengthy fight,I landed this Simcoe laker.I spent more then half an hour trying to revive the fish but it would not swim away. I felt bad,but it,s my biggest Simcoe laker to this date. I have hooked into some brutes that just wouldnt turn and snapped off. I know theres got to be a 30 plus out there. If memory serves me right,most put the fish at 24 pounds by the measurements I gave.  Here it is.Caught on a orange prizm,silver fox flutter spoon.  Oh Im not that big anymore.I was 230 there  "
