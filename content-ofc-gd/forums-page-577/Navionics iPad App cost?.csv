549948,MSBruno,2011-02-10 18:35:00,369,I was just about to buy it and I thought it was $19.99.  Now it's at $35.  Am I mistaken?  Does it go on sale often or was it always $35?  Thanks in advance  Mark
549971,thebigcatch,2011-02-10 19:06:00,138,I got it for 9.95 last year 35.00 WOW that's a lot
549983,Pikeslayer,2011-02-10 19:31:00,1443, I just checked my iTunes store receipt from Jan. 7/11. $29.99 + HST = 33.89. I know that the price is different/lower for both the iPhone & iPod.

I didn't rush to get it although I probably will once the warm weather is back. it looks pretty nifty. The iPad won't be going on the water though.  JF
550599,Canuck,2011-02-12 03:18:00,491,It was $19.99 when I bought it.  I guess they realized they could charge more.  Still pretty good value.
