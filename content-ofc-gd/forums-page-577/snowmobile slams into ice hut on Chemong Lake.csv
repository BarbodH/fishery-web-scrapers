549965,canadadude,2011-02-10 18:59:00,769,"Putting reflectors on a permanent ice hut is common sense to me, your putting a man made obstruction out on an open lake and it only makes sense to me to have it well defined. Obviously it may not stop some idiot, for what ever reason from driving into it but it does make a big difference at night for most people to see your hut.For the time and low cost involved it's worth the effort.When your out at night on the sled the headlights pick-up the reflectors instantly,it makes a huge difference,I really can't understand why anyone would not put reflectors on a permanent shack.I also don't get why people would think it's a dumb idea, maybe just people that don't sled on lakes at night think it's a waste."
549970,Old Man,2011-02-10 19:05:00,822," No one is saying it's a dumb idea. The fact is, is this shack had reflectors and lights on it and the sledder is still claiming it's not his fault and that it wasn't enough."
549973,smally21,2011-02-10 19:11:00,993,"buoys have reflectors on them, cause they're dropped in a waterway where people would hit them if they weren't clearly marked. kind of like an ice hut in the middle of the lake i suppose..........  of course, some one wacks a buoy or a weather float every now and then."
549975,canadadude,2011-02-10 19:21:00,769,"To be honest I already thought it was law for a hut to have reflectors on it, if it isn't it should be.If you ride trails in the north, bridges, trees, curves, signs etc are all clearly marked with reflective tape or paint.Accidents are still going to happen no matter what,legislating reflectors on ice huts is hardly a dumb idea."

549982,Old Man,2011-02-10 19:30:00,822," As I said, this shack had reflectors and lights. The root cause of this accident was the driver driving beyond his headlight/vision/reaction time for conditions. Plain and simple. All the reflectors in the world won't stop this from happening again."

It's was the idiots own fault and he was lucky to just get away with a damaged helmet and a permanent smile from the scar where he bit the wire with his mouth. That sled wouldn't do over 30 mph.

549695,blarg,2011-02-10 03:07:00,289,"If boats at anchor are required to have a light on you would think that reflectors on an ice hut wouldn't be too much to ask.  It's not as though there are prescribed ice hut zones on lakes, and if you can put one almost anywhere certainly the snowmobiler can't be expected to know where it will be.  No doubt people need to slow down, but then at some point if we all slowed down we wouldn't need brake lights or signal lights either, reflectors are cheap and sensible.  Ever have someone cross the street in front of you on a rainy night wearing nothing but dark clothing? Your headlights don't help a lot, now put a reflective vest on that person, or put them on a bike with reflectors..i would imagine a stationary object in low visibility would be no easier to see.  How slow is slow enough as well, and in some places even if you manage to swerve around the first shack your probabaly going to hit one of the other 30 behind it.  If it was my shack id want reflectors, for my own sake."
549701,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 03:14:00,0,maybe we should put reflectors on all the trees out there too!  not a week goes by some drunken idiot or inexperienced youth doesn't wrap their sled around a maple tree!

You just gotta pay attention and pick your spots to play and know when not to. know your limits.  If you can't see clearly you take it easy.  The guy that hits a hut with a sled isn't paying attention. If that didn't get him, something else would.  You can't make a law against stupid.  PS.

BTW the GOOD sticky reflective tape can be a little pricey....I applied some on the front and back of my boat and in various places on my trailer...not for someone else's safety but for my own good.....taking self responsibility and SAFETY has been bred into me after 30 dangerous years of working on the railroad.

Was it my fault for parking in the driveway ??... I don't think so.  I think it's exactly the same thing when a snowmobile crashes into a stationary ice hut. Either the driver isn't paying attention to where he's going, or else he's driving too fast for the conditions.  If it's dark, or snowing, or foggy or whatever, if you can't see well enough to stop in time.....slow down.  I dunno  how much simpler it can be"

549821,ecmilley,2011-02-10 14:46:00,2163,"hey guys long time no post but here's my thoughts on this as a sledder and a fisherman; with this really being the second year for the kawarthas ice fishing it is sometimes hard to remember that we have been running these lakes on our sleds long before the huts came along and sometimes they get put in traditional trails area's on the lakes, reflectors are greatly appreciated, just to identify another obstacle , i don't drive overly fast at night even when i know the area now just never know who is moving a sled to a different spot ( i came real close to a black clam the other night and was doing maybe 45km/h). we as sledders have a responsibility to ride in a safe manner as well and not go out and try and buzz other user groups of the lakes also there is no roads lines or boundrys but ther is something called respect we all need to embrace it."
549858,smally21,2011-02-10 15:42:00,993,"i hear that you might not want to put your hut in the middle of the 'ice road'.  so we're talking about a guy hitting an ice hut on his snowmobile, headlights, reflective tape etc. and the law/common sense as it applies to the ice covered lake.  so lets melt the snow and make the snowmobile a moving boat and the ice hut a stationary boat.  if there was to be a collision the moving boat is responsible to navigate safely blah blah but the stationary boat is required to be lit up side to side and front to back with red and greed and stern/anchor lights.  the two cases are almost identical, except for the ice. so in summer you are required to light up your hazard (the boat) but in winter you can put a hazard (ice hut) on the lake without identifying it?  im not endorsing night time drag races or pointing any fingers at hut owners.  just pointing out the similarity between 2 events that are being regarded quite differently."
549862,Stern Rules,2011-02-10 15:55:00,342,I second that. Common sense doesn't really seem to be common with some people.

It's not my fault, it's the hut owners fault because the reflectors and lights that by law he didn't have to have were too small.  What a knob!!! The hut owner should be reimbursed for loss by the sledders insurance. IMHO The sledder needs to take responsibility for his actions."

549520,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-09 22:17:00,0, no permit.  but the only section of groomed trail i ride is on a road with historical access rights so i don't bother.  in the future i'd like to get a pass but i need more friends with sleds first!  i hear the yank side is the way to go for riding.  40 bucks and hella good trail system... not too mention the friday all you can eat crab and prime rib at bay mills!  i'm guessing that's where you were last week?

Its sad people got hurt but to be honest with you I am just happy to hear noone was in the hut.  Its sad anyone was hurt but its not like these people don't know what they are getting into when they squeeze the throttle.

549525,DanD,2011-02-09 22:27:00,2223,"Like some else here has already said; fish huts and sleds have been sharing the ice for many years. The wooden seasonal huts haven’t changed much over the years; but the sleds sure have. Back in the 60’s & 70’s a sled was considered a fast machine, if it could hit 50 or 60 mph and that be flat out, with a five mile run (if the motor didn’t blow trying LOL); today’s sleds, that’s barely off idle. There aint enough reflective tape in the world; if the person driving the sled hasn’t a clue or doesn’t care that he’s endangering himself or the people around him. Don’t the club sponsored snowmobile trails have speed limits and rules that need to be followed; why is the ice a free for all? Yes things can still happen at lower speeds; but you have one heck of a lot more reaction time. A sled when driven by an idiot on the hard water, is no different then that same idiot driving a jet ski on the soft water; just not as many huts to hit. LOL Dan."
549526,Bernie,2011-02-09 22:28:00,3190,"It may have been unintentional accident, but certainly preventable. Fisherman said it correctly. Too much speed and over driving headlights.  They should be charged in my opinion and made to pay damages."

I have said it here many times...your government is too intrusive on it's citizens and my government is trying to catch up ASAP....we may even pass you guys...  I agree the last sentence in that article was totally unnecessary...someone there has a hidden agenda.  What next....high speed sledder hits moose/deer/bear/racoon on ice which causes multitude of injuries to the two riders....Ontario now considering reflective tape on all wildlife....  BTW I hope all parties involved have a complete recovery and then are required to give seminars on the perils of high speed sledding at night or during the day.
549529,Jer,2011-02-09 22:34:00,1426,"Several years ago, in very much the same area, a sledder ran right into the causeway (pretty sure it wasn't moving either). He became airborne and landed the sled right into the guardrail on the far side of the road (a few more feet and he might have cleared the whole thing). Apparently he had gotten turned around and thought he was headed away from the causeway, he was driving too fast at night, overdrove the headlight and couldn't react in time. He survived more or less OK, the snowmobile not so much.  Believe it or not...this happened years before they allowed ice-fishing on Chemong. Go figure..."

549556,HTHM,2011-02-09 23:04:00,4082,"Made me think of this:  An Obituary printed in the London Times - Interesting and sadly rather true.  Today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend,Common Sense, who has been with us for many years. No one knows for sure how old he was, since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape. He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as: - Knowing when to come in out of the rain; - Why the early bird gets the worm; - Life isn't always fair; - and maybe it was my fault.  Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you can earn) and reliable strategies (adults, not children, are in charge).  His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well-intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place. Reports of a 6-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.  Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unruly children.  It declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer sun lotion or a paracetamol to a student; but could not inform parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion.  Common Sense lost the will to live as the churches became businesses; and criminals received better treatment than their victims.  Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar could sue you for assault.  Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a little in her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement.  Common Sense was preceded in death, by his parents, Truth and Trust, by his wife, Discretion, by his daughter, Responsibility, and by his son, Reason.  He is survived by his 4 stepbrothers; I Know My Rights I Want It Now Someone Else Is To Blame I'm A Victim  Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone. If you still remember him, pass this on. If not, join the majority and do nothing."

549656,Dutch,2011-02-10 01:52:00,831,"There was a story on the news about this at 6:00 tonight that I was fortunate enough to catch.  Both the owner of the hut and the sled had their say.  The owner of the hut was apologetic and mentioned that he was glad no one was hurt more seriously.  Seemed like a good guy.  The driver of the sled said he was going 50 km/h and that it was windy and he couldn't see the hut.  The hut had reflectors on it (red ones) and had solar lights on top.  Apparently they weren't on as the driver said so.  Apparently he knew the lights weren't on, but he didn't see the hut at all before he hit it..uh huh...The hut was also registered with the MNR.  The driver said the only thing that saved him and his passenger was the fact the hut was made out of ""cheap"" press board and not real plywood like most people use.  He went on to say that the government should regulate huts, ""like they do in BC"" and make lights mandatory 24/7.  Why anyone would need lights during the day is beyond me.  He also said the reflectors should have been larger and that there should have been more reflectors and they should be larger and on ""all 4 corners.""  The news story was clear that they were already there on each surface.  Just from what this guy said, anyone could tell he isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, if you know what I mean.  This guy was just going too fast, even if he was going 50 (probably much faster by the looks of what was left of the sled) that's too fast in apparently windy conditions where you can't see a hut.  Also, there's no way he could know the area as there are a lot of huts in that space.  What happened to common sense and knowing your trails when snowmobiling?  Anyway - this guy deserves no respect or sympathy, his passenger maybe as an unwilling participant that was injured.  People need to really smarten up.  I just fear this incident will be used by the naysayers as a reason there shouldn't be huts/ice fishing allowed at all."

Smith-Ennismore-Lakefield Township firefighters were called to the scene to bring the woman to the shore so that paramedics wouldn't have to venture on the ice.  Ice fishing is in its second season on Chemong Lake after being allowed by the Ministry of Natural Resources.     "

549387,Michael_Brown,2011-02-09 16:03:00,411,"I thought the little line at the end of the article was unnecessary.  Just wait and see if they blame ice fishing for this, in the media. They won't mention the hundreds of snowmobiles flying around the lake or driver error. The ice angler is a victim in this, their ice hut and equipment has been destroyed. The expense of replacing it will be theirs.  I feel sorry for the persons hurt in this accident."
549404,Fisherman,2011-02-09 17:24:00,7201,You're saying the hut owner is not at fault but in the same sentence you say that the hut owner is required to put out bells and whistles to have sleeders avoid his hut.  Maybe the sleeders shouldn't over drive their headlights (speed/reaction time) and it would most likely solve the problem for both sides.  Why do others alway s have to change things to accomodate the ones that cause the problem.
549409,Jonny,2011-02-09 17:54:00,1380," I think I'd have to agree with that. The onus is on the sledder.  We've got rocky shoals, rockpiles, etc. around here, not to mention pressure cracks that can set up a solid wall of ice a few feet high. None of that is going to be marked with reflector tape.  If it's not a moonlit night, or if there's blowing snow, you have to slow down.   "
549412,dannyboy,2011-02-09 18:00:00,367,"I hope everyone on involved is ok.  Why is it that we don't like the Government interfering with our lives and paying more taxes but at the first sign of trouble there is a call for a law? smells of socialistic brainwashing to me. If we continually want the government to make sure no one gets hurt, then hand over your paycheck comrades and get in line with the sheep.  Nothing personal just an observation.  Dan"
549415,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-09 18:23:00,10439,"A lot of places require ice huts have reflectors. I didn't know they weren't mandatory in Ontario. Maybe they should be. They require you to register them, how hard would it be to require a 6""X6"" relfective square on each corner? It would save the careless sledder from damaging a hut in the dark. And it would save the ice fisherman from getting run over by the careless sledder. I believe I read about an incident last winter where a sled went right through a hut with 2 fishermen inside. They were badly injured in the accident.  Reflectors just make sense to me. IMHO"
549423,Flyboy,2011-02-09 18:47:00,26,"Sometime I sincerely questioned the 'careless' part of the sledders . . . I was almost ran over by a group of sledders that deliberately drove within arm reach of ice-fishers standing in broad daylight. Heck, I was in a bright red float suit (with reflective tapes) and standing tall. There is no excuse for not seeing all the people there. They manages to ran over and destroyed my bright orange ice-scoop as they passed so close. Cheap thrills for them, not so much for me."
549425,Dara,2011-02-09 18:50:00,3052,"If I had a hut, I would be getting a bunch of triangles from the dollar store for it. I can't figure out the guys that paint their huts white.  I also don't want it to be a law because somebody would just steal my triangles and then I would be charged.  I drive a sled and you gots to pay attention on them things. You can get hurt bad if you don't.  Hope they are all ok."
549427,Jonny,2011-02-09 18:54:00,1380,"We have to jump through so many government regulatory ""hoops"" that it raises my hackles to think we need to find another thing that we can be fined for not doing.  Snowmobiles and ice huts have had to share space on the ice in Ontario for 40+ years now and we haven't needed the huts to be marked with anything but a free registration number.  If snowmobilers are getting faster and more careless, maybe the thing should be turned around. Maybe we should impose a max speed on sleds and mandate brighter headlights for them.  Or maybe we should just leave the whole thing alone and not get all lathered up over a random and atypical accident."
549429,Joey,2011-02-09 19:07:00,9122,  Agreed !!!!!
549434,skeeter,2011-02-09 19:14:00,1907,I agree with the reflectors. I dont want to be wokin up in the middle of the night by some idiot flying thru my hut. That would put me in a REALLY bad mood!!!      All the way around!!!!!!!
549437,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-09 19:33:00,0,"sleds are so fast now, even reflectors would stop people from being idiots."
549463,Twocoda,2011-02-09 20:51:00,4130,"OK here goes nuthin....""Skeeter"" and ""common sense"" in the same sentence...  Skeeter seems to have common sense...when it comes to safety you shouldnt have to be mandated it should just come natural..way to go Skeets...  have you ever noticed they only put railings up after someone falls off a cliff?"
549477,jimmer,2011-02-09 21:15:00,2730,"Everyone should do whatever they can for safety reasons.  Maybe we wouldn't have the government telling us what to do all time if we all used common sense. No blame here, just an accident! All huts should have reflectors on each side and snowmobile drivers should watch for unknown dangers on the ice, then maybe we wouldn't read about this kind of thing. My son almost ran into an unmarked hut on Pigeon and his headlights are amazing. I remember years ago on Simcoe seeing a snowmobile crashing into a hut in some heavy fog, it was a good thing no one was in the hut. The snowmobiles back then were nothing like the ones today and that crash was scary."
549488,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-09 21:47:00,4399,"Well I don`t have a hut on the ice but if I did it would have reflective tape on it,it would be painted blaze orange and it would have solar powered flashing lights and perhaps a machine gun turret as well.  People that are dumb enough to drive around the lake at 80 MPH need all the help we can give them so they don`t kill themselves or us!!!"
549490,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-09 21:51:00,4399,"  There seems to be a correlation between the speed of the sled and the intelligence of the owner, faster=dumber"
549491,Dara,2011-02-09 21:53:00,3052,"  Mine got exactly 1000 miles on it last week, and there is nothing slow about it. I see no need for a speed limit though...just another cash grab is all it will be. Limit the bass boat speeds first.   And again...highway warning reflector triangles are a dollar each at the dollar store."
549492,Dara,2011-02-09 21:55:00,3052,  I think its more geographical...the further south
549493,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-09 21:55:00,0,  i'm jealous.  I've only put a few hundred miles on this year after it being out of action for 2 weeks with electrical issues...  looking outside at the 15cm of powder in my driveway makes me think this weekend will be some great sledding!  SAFE sledding!
549494,Dara,2011-02-09 21:57:00,3052,  You got a permit?  I'm likely riding this side this weekend.
549498,Jer,2011-02-09 22:00:00,1426,"  I thought this was interesting. This accident occured very close to the location of the polar plunge last weekend. There were almost 2000 people on the ice watching the plunge...and the paramedics won't venture on the ice when it's almost 20"" thick?"
549501,misfish,2011-02-09 22:02:00,29133," How else can ya keep up to them.  Dont think they just hit huts. One day years back on long shoal,we seen two sleds at mach speed colide.Bodies and limbs and machine parts, flying in the air.That was some scary stuff to see."
549509,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-09 22:06:00,4399,  I would not argue with you on that statement!
549510,Old Man,2011-02-09 22:09:00,822,"This isn't new. The town I grew up in in Western Manitoba had a guy hit a dock at night back in the late 70's. Took his head off. Of course speed and alcohol was a contributing factor. I've sledded almost my whole life and from the things I've seen, I have come to the conclusion that there is no cure for stupidity."
