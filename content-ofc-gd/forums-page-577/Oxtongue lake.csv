Try the deeper waters 85-100' depths, I know of a few spots along the North east shoreline where the water drops off that had Lakers. I believe there is a "" one rod per angler restriction "" on Oxtonge for winter fishing.Some of the nearby back lakes had good populations of speckies, not sure if they stock them now."
