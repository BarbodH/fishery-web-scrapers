550510,Guest BassFishingGuru,2011-02-11 22:59:00,0,"Gentlemen, years ago when my friend's son needed help on a school project, I offered to help - how hard could it be to find information on fish like peacock bass and redeye bass... Well, I found that there is a lot of information out there but it is scattered. I set out to build a site that had all the information in one spot from techniques to tips, from general information about the fish to details on knots, weights and lures.  So I spent the last three years building the site. However, I did it alone and would greatly appreciate any feedback you might have to offer. My goal this year is to spend more time fishing than writing about them"
