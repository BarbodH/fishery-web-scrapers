548809,pikeslayerjr,2011-02-07 23:20:00,7,"So after a looooong wait i finally got the chance to meetup with cliff to do some fishing this weekend. we originally got together on thursday night talked fishing strategies and looked at some maps to find some new fishing spots. Once that was done i was treated to a fish fry Cliff cooked up which turned out amazing, the batter he used was fantastic .. Once sunday rolled around i gave my friend the green light and let him know we we're going to hit the hard water. Of course by the time we got there we we're itching to pull the first one through the ice. in the first hour, we drilled a bunch of different holes, we had a few misses and a couple perch pulled out. Cliff's friend Jim showed up and saved the day by coming out with some minnows apparently the bait shop doesn't open until 12:00 so we were unable to grab some before we got there. Once cliff landed a good size walleye things started to heat up a bit. Over the next few hours we ended up pulling 12 perch, 3 walleye and a nice muskie. I kind of felt bad for Cliffs friend Jim he ended up getting skunked while we were catching fish all around him  . Jake ( my friend) and I were pretty pumped to both catch our first walleye's through the ice although mine was small and not picture worthy it was still great to finally pull one up. Jake also caught a nice muskie it was a pretty exciting but scary fight for a minute . it was a great feeling and adrenaline rush when we got its head through the ice  . when we got back to cliff's and sue's where we were treated to a hot beverage and chatted for a few minutes before having to leave to catch the super bowl.  as usual Cliff and sue's hospitality was amazing i'm really looking forward to next weekend when we get to do it all over again   these two pics are of my buddy's first walleye and muskie pretty exciting stuff..

549149,limeyangler,2011-02-08 21:28:00,5204,Thats awesome....a muskie through the ice.  Thanks for posting Jr.
549151,Big Cliff,2011-02-08 21:42:00,6899," Sorry, we don't target OOS fish LOL. Actually the only reason the boys even took an extra few seconds to snap a quick picture is because it was firsts for them. Normally we just turn them back down the hole as fast as we can get the hook out of them. Now, the 13""+ perch, we can work on that  PS. check your PMs please"
549363,Spiel,2011-02-09 14:40:00,9065,Good stuff.
