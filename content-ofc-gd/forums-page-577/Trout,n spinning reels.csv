550388,solopaddler,2011-02-11 17:38:00,8605," That was fast, good stuff bud! Almost wish I'd grabbed it myself."
550408,misfish,2011-02-11 19:20:00,29133,For that price and no shipping cost.SWEET
550072,misfish,2011-02-10 22:35:00,29133,"Whats the ideal spinning reel out there these days guys. My set up here is still an old cardinal 3 (the black one,not the green and biege) and I know it,s not the best anymore.Stout spool and line capacity is far less then whats out there today.  Your a opinions are appriciated."
550076,GBW,2011-02-10 22:40:00,8460,price tag Brian?
550078,misfish,2011-02-10 22:46:00,29133, Nothing to crazy Geoff.100-150. Might go more if I feel comfortable with the advise.
550081,irishfield,2011-02-10 22:47:00,26272,Clean/lube the Card 3 and carry on!
550084,ADB,2011-02-10 22:52:00,444,"Hey Brian,  Here's a topic I started about steelhead reels a while ago: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=29862&st=0  The general consensus was a Whiskerlite or a Stradic."
550085,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 22:53:00,0,"for the money, i'd get a pflueger.  if you got money to blow the sky is the limit."
550089,ChrisK,2011-02-10 23:00:00,2772,All depends if Trout is specifically what your using it for but other than that I'm with Irishfeild
550090,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-10 23:03:00,10439,"I have one of the old green cardinals, but my go to spinning reel for trout is a Quantum PTI20 loaded with 15# Power Pro."
550103,Rustic-Fisher,2011-02-10 23:28:00,826,"SS Whisker 1300, from Diawa,Cant beat the drag and its old school. R"
550112,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-10 23:36:00,10439,  Got one of them too.
550137,GBW,2011-02-11 00:39:00,8460,I have a Daiwa Exceler 3000 that does well.  Even held up to a big pike.
550140,misfish,2011-02-11 00:43:00,29133," Hope yer not taking about the one in yer avatar? My grandaughters elmo rod could catch that one.   I have been trying to see what Shimano has,but not liking it.   Maybe why guys are going with the float reels?"
550147,GBW,2011-02-11 00:48:00,8460,"Nope, that one was on SNAG's pflueger  *Edit*  FYI, I love the grip on the Daiwa too"
550182,toca,2011-02-11 01:29:00,274, I agree. Or Get An  Island Center Pin Reel And A 15 Gloomis Float Rod
550194,BillM,2011-02-11 01:53:00,17367,"Brian, get a cheap Okuma pin and one of the new St.Croix float rods and you'll be all set for the Notty"
550217,toca,2011-02-11 02:19:00,274, canadian tire has some good sales. last fall was on sale for like 130bucks
550286,misfish,2011-02-11 09:59:00,29133,"  Yeah. How long do you think it will take for that first hookset and forget to hang on to the spool.  Thinking about it Bill. Where would you suggest getting the pin? I know BPS has them,seem to be priced ok.The rod I have,need to get it off to Spiel for a repair."
550299,solopaddler,2011-02-11 12:16:00,8605,"Guys got an SS1300 for sale at a good price on one of the other boards I frequent.  I've dealt with him before, he's solid.   http://www.steelheadsite.com/forums/ads_item.php?id=4603"
550301,misfish,2011-02-11 12:44:00,29133,Thanks Mike. PM sent yer way bud.
550353,BillM,2011-02-11 14:56:00,17367," I've never forgot to hold onto the spool, if you do you'll only do it once!!!  lol  I'd get something used off the Floatboard.  A used Islander would probably be a good idea for a work horse reel at a decent price."
550354,solopaddler,2011-02-11 14:59:00,8605," Mild weather coming bud, time to dust off the gear."
550358,BillM,2011-02-11 15:07:00,17367,"Gear is rigged and ready to go!  I gotta make up for my 2010 season, lol."
550363,GBW,2011-02-11 15:25:00,8460,"Brian, I have an Okuma Aventa 1002 reel and I'm willing to part with due to lack of use."
550371,misfish,2011-02-11 15:42:00,29133," Thanks Geoff for the offer,but have a SS1300 being delivered today. Thanks Mike."
550381,GBW,2011-02-11 16:53:00,8460,no problem
