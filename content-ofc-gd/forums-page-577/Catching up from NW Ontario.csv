549290,trapshooter,2011-02-09 03:43:00,1234,  Right on!  I like the slick jigs for walleye and whitefish.  For walleye I just tip with the minnow but for whities I slip a micro tube over the hook and add a minnow tail as well.  I even got a laker on that set-up.  Good luck this weekend.

549123,trapshooter,2011-02-08 20:49:00,1234,"Hey gang, been having a good time out on the ice in NW Ontario this year and thought I'd share some pics.  Been mostly chasing walleye, lakers and white fish.  I'll let the pics do most of the talking.   That small sized Lindy Darter has caught me a lot of fish this winter.  Not just walleye, trout and whities too.        40"" Pike caught on a tube jig while fishing a lake trout / whitie lake.      Look at the difference between these two lake trout - caught on the same lake, same hole actually.      That's all for now.  Lots of season left up here though and I hope to get over to LOTW to chase some big lakers.  Cheers,  ben"
549124,Roy,2011-02-08 20:52:00,13728,"Ben, you make me SICK!"
549125,Joey,2011-02-08 20:52:00,9122,Nice load of fish there Ben.  Some beauty lakers and that pike is a real specimen
549126,limeyangler,2011-02-08 20:55:00,5204,Nice trout Ben....did you sneek back to Big S without telling me?!!!  Love the walleye with its fins raised.

549138,Handlebarz,2011-02-08 21:11:00,3790,Dang Ben those are some great fish I love that Pike pic. I sure do miss Laker fishing not much of that down here in the deep south.

549166,WeedLine,2011-02-08 22:35:00,322,Amazing fish Ben. Looks like you're having a great winter so far.  How deep were you fishing when you caught the pike? Excellent pictures.
549167,Drew_10,2011-02-08 22:39:00,111,Great stuff!
549169,trapshooter,2011-02-08 22:56:00,1234," Guilty Simon       The trick with them is to get the fish to chase them.  Most hits I get, I'm slowly and steady reeling up, away from a fish I've marked.  Don't stop reeling!!  Once they see it disappearing that's when they chase.  Once they chase, it really ups the odds they will hit.  The farther you can bring them off bottom, the better your odds.   The other way I get fish to hit Darters is the exact opposite strategy - by jigging above a marked fish then letting the bait sit dead still for up to 60 seconds (it's hard to not jig it!) and they dart up and pop it.  Bottom line, you need electronics to fish them effectively. It also helps to have an active bite.  For neutral to negative fish I'll turn to something else tipped with live bait."
549170,trapshooter,2011-02-08 22:58:00,1234," Hey, thanks!  The pike was caught 25' down over 40 FOW."

549288,EC1,2011-02-09 03:38:00,930,"I see there's a slick jig fish in there too! I saw your video on the special way to rig minnows onto the hook on youtube. Awesome tip! I got a couple of them too, but haven't gotten a fish on them yet, maybe this weekend...You've inspired me to fish them extra hard this weekend in hopes of getting a fish on them!"
