I've had plenty of success spinning to 'bows, browns and speckies I think an attractor fly cast upstream has to be as effective as a #2 Mepps. I know it seems weird, but can anyone suggest a wet fly that has the same attraction as a Mepps ? Thanks for reading"

Flies like this are best swung across downstream of you, they're hard to fish upstream effectively unless you want to run it under an indicator to mimic a dead or crippled baitfish."
549805,dannyboy,2011-02-10 14:25:00,367,"As a fly angler think about it from a different angle and figure what food the #2 Mepp represents, say a minnow, and choose a fly that best mimics the local minnows.  Zonkers work very well. Rabbit strip, mylar tubing, hackle, streamer hook and painted eyes - variations per the local forage.  Not my tie.  Dan"
550239,flyfisherkirk,2011-02-11 03:13:00,23,    Thanks for the reply. My post was vague I know. I haven't started tying yet. I'm still into purchasing flies. Nice fly though. I might get me a couple of those. I'm sure down and across would work fine for Spring-run Rainbows Thanks again!
550243,flyfisherkirk,2011-02-11 03:17:00,23,"    Thanks Danny, Zonkers are always a cinch. And yes, it'll definitely be on my must-haves for this Spring Fred"
