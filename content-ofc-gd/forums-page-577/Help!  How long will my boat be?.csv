550102,buckhorn250,2011-02-10 23:27:00,85,"I'm looking at a new Lund Impact 1875 with a 115Hp Mercury 4stroke. As the name says the length of the boat is 18' 9"", I want to make sure it will fit in my garage, curious if there is a rule of thum I can go by for the total length of the boat with motor (trailer has a swing tongue)...any help would be appreciated.  thanks"
550106,HTHM,2011-02-10 23:33:00,4082,"Add two feet for the motor, add two more for the trailer and you should be OK. So 22' 9"" should do you."
550111,Old Man,2011-02-10 23:36:00,822," Just a guess, but I'd say about 22"" total."
550113,Muskieman,2011-02-10 23:39:00,2472,"Can't you go measure the unit at the lot?  I once heard ... add 8' to the length of the boat.  My 14's tongue isn't a swing away and is 3' long and my 30'rude is about 18"".. that's 4 1/2 ""... I assume that your motor is WAY bigger and the tongue is probably longer."
550114,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-10 23:41:00,4399,"  I would say 20'-6"" at least."
550115,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-10 23:41:00,10439,"My boat is 17'10"" with a 90hp Merc and no swing tongue. I keep it in one of those 10'X20' fabric garages. The motor pushes out the rear wall by about a foot and the tongue sticks out the front by 2 feet. So my setup is about 23'. Yours should be 12 to 18 inches longer all together so probably 24 to 24 1/2 feet total. Not sure how much you cut it down with the tongue folded, maybe 2 feet. I would say you will be in the 22 to 22 1/2' range folded."
550116,Twocoda,2011-02-10 23:41:00,4130,some garages are only 18 feet deep ...some are 25 ...measure your garage ...
550117,Muskieman,2011-02-10 23:45:00,2472,   and the boat while on trailer with the foot down
550120,mikeh,2011-02-10 23:51:00,824,have you checked to see if the width is ok? I had a 16 boat and the trailer would fit in a garage but the 18 footer had a bigger trailer and was too wide for the garage.
550125,buckhorn250,2011-02-11 00:03:00,85,"Thanks...ya, no problem with width, garage doors are 9 ft wide. Challenge is me, the boat and the garage are no where near each other. thanks for the feedback"
550130,FishAbout,2011-02-11 00:16:00,106,Going to be a tight fit backing into the garage. You will have about 3-4 inchs on both sides backing it in.  I back our 18ft into a 9 ft door. Make sure you are straight backing up.  Your overall length will be about 23-24 ft with the motor down.
550132,mercman,2011-02-11 00:22:00,7054,Dont forget the height of the door opening.My Bro had to make his 8Ft so his Ranger and 175Merc would clear easily with room.Just check to be on the safe side
550185,HTHM,2011-02-11 01:33:00,4082,"I agree, cost me a re-upholster on a bicycle seat on my Ranger"
550193,smally21,2011-02-11 01:52:00,993,"my stratos claims to be 17.5ft but is quite a bit bigger in real life. it is 24ft on the trailer, without using the swing tongue. the trailer, like most is 8.5ft wide. the boat wont fit under a 7ft door.  so essentially its too long, too wide and too tall to go in any garage without an overheight, double door garage that is extra long.  you're going to have a heck of a time getting a 19ft boat in the garage.  if you can, you've got a nicer garage than i do!"
550248,Dara,2011-02-11 03:22:00,3052,"One test is worth a thousand expert opinions.  If it matters that much, have somebody measure the boat and motor, then, close your garage door and see what will fit."
