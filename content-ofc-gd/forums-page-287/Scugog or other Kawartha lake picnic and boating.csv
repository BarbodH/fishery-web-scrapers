803668,John Bacon,2013-08-17 16:21:00,3277,We are planning on a picnic and some boating with a couple of families.  Can anyone recommend a place?  I plan to bring a boat (16' Aluminum) to take the kids tubing and do some fishing.  Not everyone will be in the boat at once so I am looking for a place that has a public park along the shore.  Does anyone know of such a park that is close to a boat launch with parking?  I was thinking of Scugog because it is close; but I would also go to another nearby lake if there is a good place.

I'm not sure if there is a fee, there wasn't the last time we were there. Its a bit further than scugog, but scugog isn't very nice for swimming at all.  It will come up on google. Its on the 'caygeon arm of sturgeon, kinda between fenelon and bobcaygeon.  S."

803962,John Bacon,2013-08-20 02:19:00,3277,Thanks for the tips.  I ended up launching at Port Perry.  We did some tubing and some fishing.  I will definitely check the other places for our next outing.  The fishing wasn't great.  I did land a decent large mouth.  We also caught rock bass and a blue gill.
