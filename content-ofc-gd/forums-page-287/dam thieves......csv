803401,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-15 06:44:00,8243,"Crack heads and kids. I haven't had my vehicle broken into since moving out to the country from Hamilton.  Police could care less about petty theft.  Insurance companies are really cracking down on paying a second claim for comprehensive, especially from unsecured vehicles or garages etc. I am getting lazier and lazier when it comes to securing my stuff. I need to get a lock. It's scary once you add up all the stuff just in the shed. Thousands of dollars worth of a hundred here and a hundred there."
803431,Wendel,2013-08-15 14:36:00,213,"Knock on wood I haven't had anything go missing in a while, but at our trailer park in the spring some punks broke into 44 trailers! The year before our brand new trailer was in the park less then 12 hours before someone tried to break into it... Still cost 1500 to get the door replace, but they never got in... I would love to catch one of these guys, but in reality you would most likely be charged with assault for pounding the crap out of some scumbag... It's happened before and I'm sure it will happen again."
803436,Angler management,2013-08-15 14:47:00,280,"Reminded me of the time when my insurance company forced me to keep liability insurance on my showcar that was parked in garage and not being driven. They said it was in case ""somebody broke into my garage through top window and fell on the car injuring themselves while trying to steal it"". You can just imagine the the fury i felt."
803511,monterey guy,2013-08-15 22:59:00,12,"both were on bikes one had bad case of road rash add that,s right just gave him sammich."
802790,bow slayer,2013-08-12 07:55:00,1074,"just went to leave at 3 am for trip north for the week,notice my snaps were undone on one side....gone 3 baitcasters ,my fault I guess I was planning on leaving last night around 8 but was tired so had a nap got up to leave at 3.

802792,Terry,2013-08-12 09:24:00,14456,man that sucks
802799,fishindevil,2013-08-12 10:31:00,6254,Check to local pawn shops in a few days  or kijiji thieves usually try to sell the stuff !!!! That sucks for sure I have had fishing equipment ripped off in the past too !!!!!! It pisses me off to hear that crap !! I hope you get your stuff back
802801,Fishnwire,2013-08-12 11:23:00,983,"A lot of tackle thieves do so to pad out their own collection.  If that's the case, let's hope the gear is now forever cursed with bad ""joo-joo"" and that Karma will kick the guy in the butt with fishless days on the water while using it.  If you can wrap your head around such a fantasy it might help to lessen the sting, anyway."
802802,BillM,2013-08-12 11:28:00,17367,"Some people have big brass balls, I hope karma bites them in the ass."
802804,wormdunker,2013-08-12 11:36:00,1711,That sucks.  Hope u r able to retreive your equipment.
802806,woodenboater,2013-08-12 12:01:00,2277,"damn that sucks bags ! I like to think that they'll use it to catch their meat, in the slot, transport it without any skin, and get caught by a CO and thusly lose their boat, rods, car, Hello Kitty tacklebox....you get the drift.  but yeah, pretty low. Hope it wasn't a local"
802807,AmongU,2013-08-12 12:18:00,10, That really hurts!  Sorry to hear that man.  I live in westmount & had my car gone through 3 weeks ago in my driveway & my neighbour left his garage door open a couple nights ago & lost a few things too.  Damn teenagers!  Will keep my eye out.
802808,mattybculp,2013-08-12 12:53:00,388,"I can take a lot of things but liars and thieves, just makes my blood boil. Sorry to hear of the bad news, but I am a firm believer of karma. My buddy had his new born home for the first night from the hospital, he went out the next morning to go to the store and his brand new dodge ram was gone. They went through his garage found the spare set of keys and went for a joy ride, writing off the truck."
802824,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-12 14:16:00,4399,"That sucks man,  I used to leave a bunch of combos and tackle worth thousands locked in the Stratos but no more after a dirt bag was making the rounds by boat on Dalrymple ripping people off a few years back."
802825,mike rousseau,2013-08-12 14:23:00,4661,I'd rather they take my plasma then my rod....  I had my bow mount stolen of my boat in my driveway... And a small box of brand new musky baits outta my car... Along with my fishing camera with all my pics and no back ups...  If I ever catch one of these losers in action... Oh man...
802826,Angler management,2013-08-12 14:28:00,280,"I live in the ""shwa"" and i have had my fair share of stolen items... Biggest being a week old F-150 FX4. Before that we had our vehicles broken into for change, and got me good once for a nice camera, never worn $1000 leather jacket, 600 CDS, and a 500w power inverter. As soon as i put a fake camera in the driveway years ago, never had a single incident. Definetly the best $20 ever spent! Recommend it to everybody!!"
802827,quickme,2013-08-12 14:40:00,261,Man I would be pissed!!  I'm always on Kijiji looking for Baitcasters so I'll keep my eyes open   Nick
802860,mercman,2013-08-12 16:56:00,7054,"It sucks really bad, but just think what drove the idiot to do something like that. Who knows what or why, but it shows a certain desperation that should be pitied. Thievery is seldom driven by greed, but more by poverty or addiction. Still, I would kick his keister if I found him.  Paul"
802876,davey buoy,2013-08-12 19:04:00,5505,"That's bad!!,I live in Barrie with two 500watt bulbs shining on my boat on sensors,and I still won't put anything of value in till the ,morning.The high powered lights only work if my neighbours or myself our up to catch them.Hope you can get them back.It takes me 20mins before I leave to get the boat ready.I declined the in house alarm in favour of Doberman and Cane Corso,but they sleep better than I do .Heaven forbid someone wakes them up lol."

803024,bow slayer,2013-08-13 03:01:00,1074,"yes this sucks.....just glad I keep my revo,chronarch 201 and my stratics all locked up tight.....funny thing was I saw a young guy maybe about 14-16 ride his bike by at least 3 times as I was packing up having a good look each time,never thought anything about it. Whoever it was they definately watched me pack,cause they knew exactly where in the boat I placed the rods,they only unsnapped that side and never looked for anything else.  My fault thou I knew when I decided to wait to leave I should take them out until I left,but I was just too tired too bother. It sucks most because these were the baitcasters my kids use,my 12 year old is really pissed cause he loved the one he used ll the time and caught his first musky on."
803037,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-13 04:20:00,10439,So it seems you know the culprit. Did you give a description to the coppers?
803204,bow slayer,2013-08-14 02:01:00,1074," Yes I told the officers everything I could, I have been watching kijiji for ads and my oldest son is going to check a couple pawn shops in town for them tomorrow. When i get back next week i will be checking them myself."
803271,mercman,2013-08-14 14:57:00,7054,Sounds to me like you may have helped a young person get into fishing !!   He shoulda just asked you if you could take him out.
803380,i2cool2fool,2013-08-15 00:45:00,349,"Damn. I got to my truck parked in an open parking lot @ downtown London after work tonight and quickly seen the mess. Busted window. What a freaking mess. I am so pissed off right now.  If I left work on time tonight and not at 7 PM, this probably wouldn't have happened due to too many potential witnesses. Crap."
803388,monterey guy,2013-08-15 02:12:00,12,"some years ago got up 3am to go meet my dad at airport looked out window saw 2 guys breaking into my van gave chase in my underware 1got away and let,s just say other guy won,t be breaking into my van anytime soon."
803391,BillM,2013-08-15 02:22:00,17367, Gotta love catching them in the act.  I hope you laid a beating on him.
803396,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-15 04:07:00,10439,
803399,Ben_Daniels,2013-08-15 04:52:00,435,"That sucks man. Keep an eye out on Craigslist kijiji and even eBay. If the kid was biking he probably lives close by, if you know what he looks like maybe ask the neighborhood kids if they have high school yearbooks that you might be able to look at to help identify him. I had a friend who was assaulted by a younger guy and found out who it was from old yearbooks, cruise by his house and if the garage is open you might see your stuff. Yea this might seem a bit crazy I just hate hearing about people havin their stuff stolen"
