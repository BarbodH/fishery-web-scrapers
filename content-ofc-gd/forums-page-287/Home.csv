Just exploring new waters, creating new friendships and taking in all of the exciting adventures.  These experiences combined with the high water levels on the rivers around Ottawa left us missing home this summer.  However after a couple of solid weeks of the water levels dropping we were finally able to plan a few outings to get our feet wet.      Thursday was the start of three outing we have planned - Bass picked up the highlight with this BEAUTY!! Some solid footage, lots of fish and a gorgeous morning in the river - FELT GREAT!  A couple of more wading trips this week and a video in the making... Tight lines!  Rob & Rob"
