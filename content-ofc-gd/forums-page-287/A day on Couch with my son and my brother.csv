803775,kickingfrog,2013-08-18 21:51:00,8333,"Well the plan was to try Couchinching today in the hopes that some spots might produce some fish that would keep the adults happy while also holding some panfish that would keep Ryan interested.  Small issue luanching. The Orillia triathlon was on so the area was much busier then normal but the launh itself was fine and we were quickly on our way.  First spot produced a nice fish to start.  crankbait bass     And as hoped, lots of fish for Ryan. We didn't take too many pan fish photos.   The rest of the bass we did find were small but ounce we had them hooked Ryan was on the reel.     Ryan is getting better handling fish but they sometimes still end up on the bottom of the boat before they get back in the water.      And with a predictable conclusion on the ride home.   "
