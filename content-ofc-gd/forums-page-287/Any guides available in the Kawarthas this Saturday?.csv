I had a trip planned for this Saturday with a guide on Balsam, with my buddy who is here for a few weeks from Singapore and this is the only weekend we can get out.  So the guide just called and said he has to cancel due to a family situation. Which I understand but it really sucks. So I am looking for a guide or just a kind sould wo wants to treat 2 really nice guys to a day of fishing in the Kawarthas (I have a motel booked for 2 nights). We would gladly pay for your services.  Fallback plan I guess is to rent a boat and go hunting ourselves, but the last few years since we don't get out often our thinking has been ""lets just pay someone to put us on fish""  Any help appreciated."
