802409,TroutnMuskieHunter,2013-08-09 13:18:00,1362,Very nice Muskies indeed guys!! Congrats Mike on your PB
802430,Rattletrap2,2013-08-09 16:32:00,1652,"Yeah, This has to be one of the best shots I have seen. Way to go guys!"
802439,Jds63,2013-08-09 17:32:00,1365,"congrats, great footage !"
802448,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-09 19:33:00,8243,"Mike congrats on 2 super fish. The likelihood of them being landed next to each other on the same hardware must be very rare.  By the way I thought your beautiful boat looks familiar. Oh wait I see a 95 Starcraft Superfisherman 190 with a 115 Mariner parked in my driveway. Nice fish and rig Mike. Love your boat.  The fish took a while to recover I see, or where they trying to get a good look at you as to remember to give you both some payback. As a Musky guy any tips on methods to ensure a good recovery?"
802470,Handlebarz,2013-08-09 22:57:00,3790,Thanks everyone yes it will be a PB hard to beat but I will be trying.  They both released very good I only had to hold my fish a few seconds until it was upright in it own. Ron's musky was the same way.  I will always let the fish go if it can stay swimming in its own. I will stay with the fish until it goes under that way another boat does not run it over.  Ron's fish was also totally fine it just stayed on the surface for 3-5 min it was just recovering and went down very strong I did not film until it went down as we separated the boats so they could stay with it. I got my lines ready to go and also take a breath to realize what had just happened.
802484,Rich Nelson,2013-08-10 01:00:00,332,Awesome Mike! Congrats on the new PB!
802639,Handlebarz,2013-08-11 02:21:00,3790,Thanks bladeburner and yes it was awese
803031,Fisherpete,2013-08-13 03:27:00,1814,W O W !  That is incredible!  Pete
803159,Handlebarz,2013-08-13 23:15:00,3790,Lol yes Pete WOW said it all what a rush it still is.
803201,Ron,2013-08-14 01:35:00,1683,"Hey Mike,  I thought I replied to this earlier. I had written up a follow up report with yours but for some reason it is not here. Well here it goes again.....   Wow, what an unbelievable weekend we had on St. Clair!!!  Firstly, how can you beat the company we had after the days fishing by visiting a couple of great people I am privileged to call friends. We had some great conversations, lots of laughs and even some education on life in general. Fishing was far better than we had anticipated for this time of year but I guess when the stars align and using top quality gear and mainly the Handlebarz d-10's how can you not have a great weekend!  Keith and I lost track of the amount of follows we had for the weekend, the amount of hookups were incredible! The quality fish we had caught over the weekend were well above our expectations that's for sure. Myself putting a 48 and a pair of 52's in the boat was stellar. I don't think we can top off the double header though. It was just milliseconds from being a triple header!  My buddy Keith had a follow right before Mike hooked into his nice big fat 54"". Hearing the screams and f bombs coming from Mikes boat, I certainly knew he had a great fish on. I was watching Mike play the fish out and we were  just about to go over to see this tank after I finish off my retrieve with the big oval at the end of the cast. Just as i am starting my turn on the Handlebarz custom tie, I see my big fish following aggressively behind. I instinctively drop the tip down to continue another oval and just on the rise, I get to see my prize engulf my offering. What a rush to see a fish of this size take a d-10 and turn. GAME ON!  I don't know who got their fish in the net first, Mike or myself. All I know is we had a couple of sows boated and both were definitely picture worthy! It was less than a 2 minute cruise on the electric to Mikes boat to capture what i believe is a first. (Definitely a first for me anyways).  Hot lures of choice for the weekend for us were:  Electric Black Series Black Nickel blades - caught 6 Electric Black Series Chart blades - caught 3 Blazin walleye - caught 2 Custom color (Thanks Mike) - caught 2, Smitty Dog - caught 1  Cheers, Ron..."
803304,Handlebarz,2013-08-14 17:17:00,3790,"Dang Ron that's a killer write up I wonder what danna and Keith would have to say lol.  Here are some of the other fish caught that weekend a d during the week by me. Ron's 48"" his first 52"" Chris a customer who caught a 52"" and a 53 1/2"" both caught on the blazin walleye. I had a 51"" and another I did not measure.            "
803324,NAW,2013-08-14 19:14:00,4022,Man.  Wicked report Mike!
803325,davey buoy,2013-08-14 19:20:00,5505,They are some huge fish!!!nice report!
803334,cowanjo,2013-08-14 20:20:00,249,"Mike - Stop it - I am going to have to just stop working and live in your shed and get in boat everytime you go. What a great report your baits are awesome, Great fish."
803347,leaf4,2013-08-14 21:24:00,2466,"Wow September 8th cannot come fast enough, going to st Clair for a charter with rampage... will need a musky setup shortly after... lol"
803490,Handlebarz,2013-08-15 20:42:00,3790,Thanks guys  John you know there is always a open seat for you here  Have fun out there Leaf im sure you will find fish with him
803494,Richie Razor,2013-08-15 21:13:00,536,Thats just freakin awesome!!! I don't think i've ever seen a musky double header with 2 legit monsters before. Get ready to be internet famous.
803552,Handlebarz,2013-08-16 09:51:00,3790,Lol I doubt the Internet famous and that's ok with me. I was just happy to share the awesome day with two great friends and my wife. 
803614,mistaredone,2013-08-17 01:45:00,913,Amazing!!!  Congrats guys. Some monster fish there
801775,Handlebarz,2013-08-05 18:23:00,3790,Well here is a snippet of the day we had out on LSC today Ron and I corssed paths out there and so did these two big girls what a awesome Day.      
801781,Christopheraaron,2013-08-05 18:52:00,3525,Nice! Did you have your sign?
801783,irishfield,2013-08-05 18:57:00,26272,Come'on Mike... Danna supplies me with better pictures! Congrats on your PB!
801786,Handlebarz,2013-08-05 19:10:00,3790,I have my OFC ruler with the logo in the picture.  Yeah Wayne but not everyone wants to be her firiend so some will have to wait and yes it was a great PB I will not soon forget this was better then sharing the boat with Ron
801812,outllaw,2013-08-05 23:00:00,1232,that goes to show. good guys great karma.
801825,Djeep,2013-08-06 01:13:00,199,"awesome stuff mike! cant wait for the full report  edit: saw the video, holy moly!"
801828,Handlebarz,2013-08-06 01:24:00,3790,"Well today I had a blast out fishing LSC with my wife Danna we hit the water around 5am as it was her first time out fishing in a bit so we wanted to get as much time in as possible and well I'm always up at 4 so I don't sit round waiting to fish I just go. Here was our view first thing     It did not take long to get the first fish to follow as Danna had one on the first cast but it would not commit we put in about two hours before our next follow we had a few but no takers around 8:30 I switched up to a disco inferno double 10 and sure enough that was the ticket first cast I got this nice 48""    Quick shot and she was gone back. We had a few more follows and then I got a nice Tiger but lost it boat side that would have been my first tiger Oh well I finally got to see one that was not a picture very cool and exciting.  It was now 9:30 and I was watching a friend doing a figure 8 close by us and it was a big fish I had to make my silly comments I would expect nothing less from him well as I make them comments I have a new PB nail my bait again this time I know its a HUGE fish. The battle was great and very fun I was watching Ron in his boat and hear him saying something he has a big fish on also VERY cool. My wife does a kick azz net job and I can relax well I can now shake like a person on there 5th red bull of the morning and 4 5 hour energy drinks this fish had me weak at the knees. Ron calls over as he has a big girl netted we were within a cast of each other most of the day so he comes over and we compare our fish which was very cool both were on the Double 10 Handlebarz so awesome. here is our victory shot so wicked cool to tie the boats together and get a picture together with these great fish.  Rons Fish was 52"" and mine was 54"" totally awesome NEW PB for me upgrading me by 2""      54"" swimming away   52"" resting at the back of my boat   We chatted a bit but my wife was getting ready to get he own fish of the day so we were back at it I tell you she was sick of it and still is of me replaying the catch she reminds me she was there LOL. I guess she is upset that she has netted a 51"" last week for me also and she lost her couple big ones. Any way she did get on the board with this nice looking 40""    Here is a video I put together from the two big girls I would have had other footage but I found out the hard way that the GOPRO cameras DO NOT FLOAT WHEN THEY HAVE THE FLOATY ATTACHED TO THEM Yes I lost a $500 camera set up today to start the day and am not happy but did make up for it with the new PB.  http://youtu.be/l7aR5_swNjg"

802046,Handlebarz,2013-08-07 09:56:00,3790,Thanks everyone it was a killer morning I will not soon forget.    Cliff I was having a hard time as it just took a good jump and I had to edit out a bunch of Fbombs for the video so you don't get to hear what lead up to my studering fool comments lol.  I knew she was big and lightly hooked just one hook in the corner of her mouth and yes the hook popped out in the net assoon as I grabbed her and opened her mouth it fell out very lucky that Danna had a great net job.
802051,wormdunker,2013-08-07 10:41:00,1711,Nice fish.  Thanx for the pix.  Too bad about your camera.
