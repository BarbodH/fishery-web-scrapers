803619,Burtess,2013-08-17 03:28:00,901,Was at Sail in Burlington today and they have the Humminbird Ice transducers on sale for $63.99 if anyone is interested.  I picked up a XI 9 20 which is for the graphs to go with my newly purchased 570 (from Radioworld for $99)....  Burt
803698,SirWhite,2013-08-17 22:02:00,210,Good deal. How do you find the 570? $99 seems so low
803736,BillM,2013-08-18 12:41:00,17367,"Good deal, always nice to have a spare."
803737,Burtess,2013-08-18 13:18:00,901," Haven't used it yet but looking at the high vertical res. and the very fast scroll speed when set to ""ultra"" I think it should do well for ice fishing.  Radioworld apparently bought a large number of these units at a very low price and are selling them off.  They have lots left.   Yup, the spare will become the modified summer transducer from my Pirhanna Max 160.   Burt"
