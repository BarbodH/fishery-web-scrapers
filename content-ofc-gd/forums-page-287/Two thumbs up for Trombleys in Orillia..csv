Countless times I've gone their for their special sales only to find out they were either out of stock, stock wasn't arriving or the old bait and switch technique.  Last time was this spring, they wnted $387 for a Minn Kota trolling motor that Sail had on for $260.  I'll drive the same distance and pocket the $127 plus tax."
