804093,Fisherman,2013-08-20 19:56:00,7201,"I think you're about a month late, they've been in the rivers for some time now."
804095,Twocoda,2013-08-20 20:03:00,4130,Good on ya ...better when they are still presentable to the eye...nice shootin
804118,Richie Razor,2013-08-20 20:58:00,536,"Let the flossing begin!  Nice color on that one though. It's a wonder how some people keep them when they turn brown or black, I mean do they actually eat them?  Nice catch, river mouth Salmon or Steelhead is the only way I go"
804127,davey buoy,2013-08-20 21:15:00,5505,"I think there is still a lot of time left?,I hope so,I'll be a month or more late lol."
804142,SirCranksalot,2013-08-20 22:02:00,3291," Well, I didn't say it started today, now did I??"
804153,Fisherman,2013-08-20 22:57:00,7201,"One would think that ""started"" means just commenced, but anyway, they have been there for a while and probably another month and half if not more."
