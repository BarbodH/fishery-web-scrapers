803426,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-15 13:44:00,4399,How did we ever manage to fish before braid....
803476,musky_hunter,2013-08-15 19:04:00,328,"i like samurai but it bleeds too much, you can order samurai in yellow.  i like sx1 and sonic braid the most"
803489,FrankTheRabbit,2013-08-15 20:37:00,479,"I use 20lb PP with a Pflueger spinning reel and I also get a birds nest from time to time. I don't know what causes it, but if I don't catch the mess soon enough, I end up getting a much bigger nest! I haven't had any irregular breakages, just the birds nest issue."
802967,okumasheffield,2013-08-13 00:36:00,318,"Lost 2 3/4oz Rapala crankbaits due to line breakage this past week while long bombing from shore using 7' Medium spinning outfit with 30lb PowerPro Super8Slick  I believe the line breakage was caused by the crazy 'birdnests' I was getting once every 30 casts with no apparent reasons. (never before!)  Since - I had never had this problem with any mono/floro/braided lines on the market - I was not casting against the wind - There was no excessive line slack when working lures/retrieving lines - It was my 1st time using PowerPro Slick, I could only think the line was the problem  what do you guys think?  Added: The 'birdnests' were on the line itself, not on the spool"
802973,manitoubass2,2013-08-13 00:45:00,11391,What is a china knot? Lol. Maybe you uttered that term and offended your line?
802979,Richie Razor,2013-08-13 00:55:00,536,Lol never heard china knot before too. Please explain.
802991,dylan21,2013-08-13 01:39:00,22,I've tried super slick. never bought another spool. I only use the regular power pro. I found that the super slick was too soft and frayed easily.
803028,Fisherpete,2013-08-13 03:13:00,1814,Check the eyelets on your rod - one crack in a ceramic eyelet turns it into a razor blade... seen it cut 80lb PP like butter!
803034,okumasheffield,2013-08-13 03:51:00,318, Good advise. Just made sure they are all OK  My main concern is the birdnest I have never experienced before with spinning outfit.
803035,manitoubass2,2013-08-13 04:12:00,11391,"Birdsnests with a spinning outfit???? Is it possible you spooled your line too loose?  I don't mean to sound like I'm putting you down or anything, but that shouldn't be happening at all unless there is operator error involved IMO. For the record, I don't like super slick either, I much prefer the original. But the one set up I have with super slick has def not performed like you stated?"
803050,Gregoire,2013-08-13 12:50:00,1397,"Super slick is crap. Stick to regular power pro if you can stand the noise, or 832 or the older suffix braid if you can find it."
803062,Garnet,2013-08-13 14:19:00,2056,Snap casters usually have the most trouble with birds nest.  And you never can spool braid to tight.
803064,quickme,2013-08-13 14:29:00,261,I haven't used braid before but I know with Mono you can spool the line backwards which usually causes a lot of tangles.   Nick
803072,captpierre,2013-08-13 16:26:00,2521,"I had lots of trouble with large knots come flying off the spinning reel spool casting 30 lb PP braid. especially with jerking, or jigging.  Guys on this sight gave me great advice.  1.  lighter line.  I now use 10 lb. 2.  do what you can to have the line spool tightly. 3.  Flip the bail manually after every cast. 4.  after bail flipped sweep the rod away from the cast direction to pick up slack before reeling in.  lighter and tighter -problem solved."
803114,Angler management,2013-08-13 20:01:00,280,Ive had same thing happen when comming across a ratsnest while casting slick 8. That line is poop and i stopped using it. It falls apart much quicker and isnt nearly as strong as regular PP.
803120,206,2013-08-13 20:34:00,563,"i love power pro slick 8 .....sounds like line twist or retrieving slack line?  my wife and kids tend to do this often on spinning gear keep an eye out you get that one loop pop off then reel line over top of it and all hell can break loose.  the next cast will""grab the loop and pull more line off, you end up with 2 ends coming off the spool at a time, most cases you can unwind it easily some times not so easy"
803140,young_one,2013-08-13 22:03:00,620,"15lb PP S8Slick has been my go-to braid for chucking spoon off piers, nothing wrong with the line and I usually out cast other anglers.  I'm not dealing with a lot of abrasion resistance and landing fish around 30lb has been no problem.  Never had snap issues like you mentioned. (I'm on a spinning reel)"
803144,Dan668,2013-08-13 22:21:00,1120,My parents both use superslick 20lb braid on spinning gear. No problems what so ever and their not the best fisherman. All i've told them to do is close the bail manually. Probably the best braid outside of daiwa samurai and sunline sx1 imo
803171,Ralph Field,2013-08-13 23:47:00,1018,"If you didn't use a bit of mono backing , then your line may be spinning on the spool."
803196,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-14 01:23:00,4399,And that is why mono is on my spinning gear...flip this sweep that bah!!!!!
803206,okumasheffield,2013-08-14 02:01:00,318, I do.  To save money. haha
803209,okumasheffield,2013-08-14 02:03:00,318," That is what I thought as well. However, I could not witness it happening whenever I paid close attention to my line/spool.  Had to cut lotsa line off due to the crazy knots"
803210,okumasheffield,2013-08-14 02:04:00,318, Good call.  Let me try it & report back
803212,dylan21,2013-08-14 02:18:00,22,"daiwa samurai is a great line. it costs more but is worth it. I wish there was a hi vis colour they made like a white or yellow but besides that it's great. It's slicker than regular PP and PP slick, IMO, which means more casting distance."
803223,John Bacon,2013-08-14 04:12:00,3277," I use a slight variation of this. - Rather than flipping the bail manually, I give the handle about a quarter turn to flip the bail. - Then sweep the rod to take the slack out of the line. - Then begin my retrieve.  This should produce the same results as the technique described about but is a little quicker and more natural once you are used to it."
803225,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-14 05:10:00,8243,"I had no idea a mono backing was a must when I first spooled my braid on 4 years ago. I've had that line on so long I can't remember the brand, I think it might be Spyderwire, I'll check. I would have to change my mono at least once before Bass opening and maybe twice before the years end. Never mono again other than maybe an ultra light, and even then I always use a flouro leader for the clear water here on Erie.  I do however tie on a 1oz weight to the lines the first time I put the boat in the water in the spring. I'll troll out until I can see the spool, then reel it in while still trolling with the drag tight. I will do that every few months or so. It is used probably 10 months a year and sees salt water down south. Thousands of casts and I haven't lost a yard of it. I have fluorocarbon on all my baitcasters, but haven't made a cast this year since I rigged my boat with downriggers and dipsy's for walleye and rainbow this summer. After hauling in these silly sized deep water fish for the last month plus here I may not make a cast for sometime. My fishing fund is in overdraft from running 25 plus miles a day, so I may be casting sooner than latter.  Off topic, I love the big fish but don't love the big fuel bills. Have spent 8 times what I spent last year by now in fuel and oil."
803249,Garnet,2013-08-14 11:52:00,2056,I stop the line with my finger just before the bait lands. That little tug takes the loop out then I manually close bail.
803415,Rich,2013-08-15 12:31:00,3927,"30lb is overpowered on my senko rod, it causes the same problems. Its just too thick. Like casting yarn almost. I just deal with the overrun every 6 casts. Lol"
