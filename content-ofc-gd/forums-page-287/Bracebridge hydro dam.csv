803503,northernpike56,2013-08-15 21:50:00,717,Whats the fishing like at this spot? Looks like its good for smallmouth. Any walleye or pike swimming around as well? Thanks
803513,Rich,2013-08-15 23:13:00,3927,I have heard of walleye being caught there. All I caught was sunfish and some large crappies. Good luck
803514,craigdritchie,2013-08-15 23:18:00,1586,"Rock bass, some smallmouth and weiner walleyes, lots of chub. Not as good as it looks."
803526,northernpike56,2013-08-16 01:38:00,717,"Ok cool- my sister wants me to drive her down there to shop, so I figure I'll fish the dam a bit then we can go out for lunch etc. Few years ago I caught a very large smallmouth there but that was it. Will try drifting worms and split shot around there when I go, I have been having a ton of luck for walleye and bass with that setup this week already."
803535,skdds,2013-08-16 02:37:00,195,tried it few weeks ago..no real luck there. Maybe better earlier in year. Caught some nice smallies from a canoe on the muskoka river about 5 min away though..good luck!
803538,buick14,2013-08-16 02:52:00,741,"I've caught decent smallies but nothing over 3.5, small walleye but caught a few decent ones before they dropped all the stone in a few years ago.  Pike also, seen a biggun a few times, most likely catch is a 3-5lber.  Rock bass galore.  I'm talking about the one by downtown.  The other Wilson's falls isn't as good, muskoka falls is also an option."
803541,northernpike56,2013-08-16 03:50:00,717,Okay great- I'll have my phone with me so taking pics of any good catches. Is there anyway to upload directly to here or do I have to go through photobucket?
803561,torco,2013-08-16 13:08:00,656,"Have fished below Wilson's falls and did well for smallish smallmouth bass. This was a few years ago and a similar situation fished while the girls shopped. Apparently there are brown trout being stocked but I am not sure how successful that has been,"
803603,redpearl99,2013-08-16 22:43:00,259,Fished it last week.  Nothing but rock bass and small smallies
803753,northernpike56,2013-08-18 18:02:00,717,"Thanks guys, going to try again possibly tomorrow or tuesday, with some worms this time too. Will post if I can actually catch something cool"
