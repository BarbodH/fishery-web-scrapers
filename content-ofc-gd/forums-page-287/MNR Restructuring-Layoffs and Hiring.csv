803560,Rod Caster,2013-08-16 12:45:00,5784,"Apparently these cuts mean more CO jobs but less testing, field work, study jobs. I somewhat agree with the extra CO's doing better enforcement and maybe bringing in a few extra $$, but it's hard to enforce what you don't understand. I guess they'll be farming their science out of house... maybe they could use data from the Experimental Lakes Area...no, wait a minute!! grrrr   I get the feeling that is exactly what is happening."
803564,dave524,2013-08-16 13:47:00,4508," Hunters and fishermen do better under a Conservative Government .   P3TA and the likes of them, "" Environazis"" do better under the Lib/Left"
803582,manitoubass2,2013-08-16 16:56:00,11391,"Hey rc, I just heard on the radio that another group is looking at taking over the experimental lakes project. Anyhow, I'm not sure if it means anything, but the MNR are out full force in NW Ontario. I've never seen so many out in all my years. Maybe a last ditch effort to show what type of finances they can generate?  That's just a speculative guess however"
803593,Bill Shearer,2013-08-16 20:50:00,456,"I hope it's not a case of too little, too late! None of us law abiding fishers/hunters ever mind the MNR personnel coming into camp, or checking fish retained while on the water. I, in fact am very happy to see them. It does not happen often where I fish. It pains me to see the 'no overtime', 'no holiday extra pay' that has been the norm for years, in the province. Either the present government cares for the resources or it doesn't. It's up to the voting public to stand up and be firm! Question your local MPP. Get involved. Being 'political' is not a disease, but rather a right under the laws of the land. Change will happen, but not right away, and certainly not easily. IMO."
803612,woodenboater,2013-08-17 01:35:00,2277,Something from the Globe about the MNR layoffs.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/wynnes-scaled-back-cuts-part-of-plan-to-reconnect-with-rural-regions/article13806259/#dashboard/follows/
803688,Twocoda,2013-08-17 20:45:00,4130,I was talking with a CO this morning as they checked our licences and it seems the cuts are all office jobs and wont affect the Officers...the COs went through cutback process a few years ago...which got me to thinking while i continued to fish...they now travel with an OPP officer...think about this for a second...a conservation authority officer doesnt need a warrant to go through your car where as an OPP officer does...the OPP is there for CO support hence making access to the private property (car or house) open and warrantless...i know if you arent doing anything wrong there is no need to worry...but...it just seems to be another Charter of Rights loop hole....Im sure OPP officers cost more than COs increasing the cost of enforcement....doesnt this make sense? so i was thinking because of the extra cost to accommodate the OPP enforcement this is possibly a contributing factor to these cutbacks
803713,danc,2013-08-17 23:36:00,4677, I'm lucky if I see one every ten years in NWO.
803731,chessy,2013-08-18 04:36:00,610,"if a warden goes in your house with out a warrent he had better come out with a fish and wildlife infraction ... or his butt is fried.. and maybe some of the bioligist should go , why is a bioligist that knows nothing about fish responsible for fisheries departement in the mnr officer when she specilized in mamals.. and the golden handshake was 2 weeks for every year worked plus regular severance. and that program does not run out till jan 30"
803733,fishindevil,2013-08-18 10:17:00,6254,The OPP and CO's have been working together for years in the same boat it's not a new thing by any means !!!!
803756,BillM,2013-08-18 18:18:00,17367," We had a visit from two CO's on White Otter probably 20 mins after we were done unpacking.    I've also had them visit me out on Nipigon, lol!"
803759,Roy,2013-08-18 19:20:00,13728,"The place I've been checked the most is on Nipissing. Every visit there I get stopped at least once. Very professional, cordial folks doing their job. They make sure you have everything you need on your boat safety wise, ask how the fishing has been, check for obvious signs of impairment, then wish you a good day. It's the way it should be."
803830,Rod Caster,2013-08-19 08:11:00,5784,It was more than office jobs in the Nipissing region. Lots of technician jobs of as well.
803323,Jon,2013-08-14 19:04:00,209,For those interested in changes at the MNR:  http://www.opseu.org/ops/ministry/mnraug132013.htm     Jon
803326,torco,2013-08-14 19:22:00,656,Pretty sad state of affairs...these cuts are barely a drop in the bucket of the provincial treasury
803327,Jds63,2013-08-14 19:26:00,1365,585 million dollars spent on the cancelled gas plant couldn't help ? and they probably paid a consulting firm hundreds of thousands to do a study on reductions ....  I just don't understand ...
803335,craigdritchie,2013-08-14 20:23:00,1586," And yet in the recent by-elections, people continued to vote for the Liberals - to the point they actually retained two seats!!  Had the Ontario Liberals not squandered billions after billions on greasy deals like the gas plant fiascol (nearly $600 million gone poof!) ... the e-health theft/scandal ($1 billion gone poof!) ... the Ornge scandal (another $1 billion gone poof!) ... and McGuinty's green energy deal with Samsung (which will cost Ontario taxpayers $600 million a year for the next 20 years ... MEGA POOF!!!) then perhaps these MNR employees would not be out of work today. I blame their situation 100 percent on complete and total mismanagement by the provincial government."
803339,Raf,2013-08-14 20:26:00,3495,sez cut 102 jobs yet hire 250.  what am i missing??
803341,SmokestackLightnin,2013-08-14 21:07:00,390,Here is the biggest concern:  Centralize communications in Toronto
803342,Bertrand93,2013-08-14 21:09:00,10,"That's just sad, especially seeing its the guys/gals that work in the field that are getting cut. The suits making the big bucks are safe, probably getting a raise"
803344,davey buoy,2013-08-14 21:15:00,5505,"What employer would say that?only one I know,and were talking about it.How do they get away with it?"
803345,Bill Shearer,2013-08-14 21:18:00,456,"148 took the 'Golden Handshake"" to bail before that too was held back. Craig is correct about the by-elections. I can't believe that any got voted back in. Mis-management with a capital M"
803349,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-14 21:33:00,4399,Ya keep voting Liberal...really grinds my gears that the person calling the shots was not even elected for the position!!!
803351,fishindevil,2013-08-14 21:45:00,6254,"MNR stands for ""ministry of no results"". Get rid of the red tape crap fire the minister of the environment they are useless !!!! But as usual it's the people that really matter get layed off not the higher-ups !!!!! What a sad state our resources are in and the govt just keeps gutting the MNR more and more ...... Pathetic"
803353,wildeye rainbow,2013-08-14 21:52:00,123,"The MNR is only a fractional shadow of what it was in the 70's and 80's when I entered the MNR workforce as a young smolt.  The MNR used to be a hands-on outdoor organization, rehabbing and stocking watercourses, wildlife transplants (like the wild turkey), etc.  It used to be a great place to work.  Since the early 90's, a process the suits called ""Change Management"" started the pruning process.  MNR starting getting out of the hands-on stuff and was involved in monitoring and auditing and trying to secure partners to do their former work (ie. downloading). The term ""core business"" was used to devolve the many things MNR did to just a few ""core"" jobs.  The Liberals were not the only ones that have scavenged the MNR - it started with the PC government of Mike Harris and a layoff of over one-third of staff in 1996.  And it carried on from there.  I was lucky as I found a new work when Mike handed me the pink slip.  I feel for the people that are losing their jobs - they all have families, mortgages, loans, etc. and it will be a tough adjustment.  It's a shame what has happened to MNR over the years.  WR"
803354,Acountdeleted,2013-08-14 21:52:00,2562,Its why I had to get out of the Province. There is no place left for the blue collar field worker in Ontario. I'll be back when the Provencal government actually cares about the environment.
803364,Ralph Field,2013-08-14 23:19:00,1018,Maybe the liberals are planning to do away with the MNR and put our native bands in charge of all MNR functions in the not to distant future. At least there would be COs in the field to enforce the laws.
803370,Kerry,2013-08-14 23:56:00,383,"I think it started before that when our buddy BOB who was painted with an orange brush at the time decided to take our license dollars and put them in to 'general revenue', never to be used for the fisheries again.....Funny he paints himself with a red brush now. Kerry"
803373,Sharkbait22,2013-08-15 00:10:00,297,Liberals have messed up but would Tim Hudak do any better for MNR?  Would he follow in Mike Harris' footsteps? Case of lesser of two evils? Conservatives are typically anti-science and less willing to accept change. NDP the answer?
803374,Sharkbait22,2013-08-15 00:12:00,297,This has change.  Most fish and wildlife dollars come from licence fees - a real problem when the number of anglers is dropping each year.
803375,BillM,2013-08-15 00:13:00,17367, You didn't move out west for the $$$$?
803376,bobogo,2013-08-15 00:23:00,76," you're missing the part where they say ""plan"" to hire 250 new jobs. That could be over the course of who knows how many years."
803377,porkpie,2013-08-15 00:29:00,2521,"Most resource management jobs have average salarys even out west.  Starting wage for a conservation officer is relatively low in Alberta for example, compared to a job driving a truck in the patch!"
803384,craigdritchie,2013-08-15 01:37:00,1586," In this case, more of a golden shower than a golden handshake.   HIstorically, the MNR has usually done better under the Conservatives than it has under the LIberals. Conservative vote base tends to be stronger in rural ridings, compared to the Liberals, who tend to have stronger support in major cities. Mike Harris wasn't everyone's cup of tea, but his government was very good to MNR.  Anti-science? Not at all. That's crap made up by the Toronto media.  NDP is NOT the answer - they are the worst thing that could posibly happen to MNR. Were you not here when Bob Rae's NDP wanted to hand control of MNR over to the Indians?"
803408,dave524,2013-08-15 10:51:00,4508,"  As a grad of the B. Sc. Forestry program at U of T in the early seventies, I can tell you the decline started pretty much at the name change from the Dept of Lands and Forests to the M.N.R."
803433,Wendel,2013-08-15 14:43:00,213,"the 250 new jobs are most like low paying call centre type jobs. The MNR is not the only place to layoff/buyout expensive long term employees and replace them with low cost employees.  Look at what some manufacturing corporations have done, the government is no different.  It's all about the bottom line, management will always save their own ass first by cutting people under them..."
803457,outllaw,2013-08-15 16:15:00,1232,sad eh. a rich resource province. mnr have taken hits for years. do you remember the days a conservation officers job held esteem. we can thank our goverments for selling/giving away our kids heritage.
803507,wildeye rainbow,2013-08-15 22:24:00,123,"I don't think so Craig.  I was there and his government was anything but ""very good to MNR"".  He blitzed the few hands-on things that MNR used to do - aggregates, lands program, forestry nurseries, etc.  But to be fair, the downward slide happened with earlier governments - Mike just did the cutting more fervently.  There was always talk about merging with the MOE - perhaps it's time to take any relevant parts and merge and eliminate the extra management. "
