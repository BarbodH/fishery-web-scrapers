803356,John Bacon,2013-08-14 21:58:00,3277,"I have a 2008 Mercury 50hp 2 stroke motor.  Does anyone know the exact bolt and tread size to attach the steering linkage to the motor?  I tried measuring it and it appears to have a 10mm outside diameter.  I assume that it is metric because the 0.393"" outside diameter does not convert to any common fraction.  Assuming the it is a 10 mm bolt.  Does anyone have any idea what the thread size would be?    "
803359,aplumma,2013-08-14 22:32:00,6896,John you can get a pitch gauge from most auto parts places. You can also contact Mercury to order the bolt. I will make an assumption here and since it is a high stress bolt it needs to be higher grade bolt like a grade 8. Since the cost of the pitch gauge  to find a grade 8 bolt you will be cheaper getting the bolt from a Mercury dealer.   Best to you  Art

803366,hirk,2013-08-14 23:22:00,571,"you better make sure its the correct grade stainless like Art said, you have single cable steering, if the bolt sheers while running people could die, give that some thought before you settle for what fits"
803367,John Bacon,2013-08-14 23:35:00,3277,"Thanks, but I am not replacing original bolt.  I am looking at adding an attachment to steer my 2.5 hp kicker motor.  I don't think anyone's life will be on the line if I lose steering while I troll so I am not too concerned about strength."
803410,DanD,2013-08-15 11:11:00,2223,"I don't know what attachment you're adding; but if you have the original steering bolt, pull the sucker out and confirm the size and thread pitch. Take the bolt into a fastener supply store. Here in London we have places like A&H Bolt & Facca Fasteners; Scarborough must have similar places? Those guys will tell you exactly what you have and they'll likely have whatever you want for your attachment. Facca is like a cookie store to me, only to be beaten out by the candy store Princess Auto. LOL  Dan."

803438,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-15 14:50:00,10439, Dan I told him what size and thread earlier. I measured the one off the engine I don't have on a boat at the moment.
