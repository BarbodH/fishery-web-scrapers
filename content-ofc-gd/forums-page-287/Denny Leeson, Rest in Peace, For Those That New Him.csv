803286,Terry,2013-08-14 15:55:00,14456,"he was always one of the top 10 back when I did tourneys, he was a great fisherman and a great asset to the fishing community ...RIP"
803289,Musky or Specks,2013-08-14 16:10:00,2710,Denny use to help me with my pitching technique way back when I use to fish largemouth. Dude was a sharpshooter when it came to putting a bait were it needed to be. Always helpful and a really nice guy
803303,craigdritchie,2013-08-14 17:17:00,1586,That truly is sad news. Denny was a class act in every sense ... wonderful guy who will be sorely missed.
803312,Steve,2013-08-14 18:09:00,2075,"A legend around the Hamilton fishing scene.  A true role model.  He was one of the first who sat me down and explained the importance of reading the water, looking beyond what is directly in front of me, and seeing the ""big picture"".  Sound fluffy...however, the advice likely helped me more than anything else I have learned to date.  He was a top notch angler, as is his son Bruce.  Sad news indeed."
803316,Rich,2013-08-14 18:41:00,3927,I learned a lot of my fishing knowledge as a youngster from Denny.  Condolences go to his wonderful family.
803320,Steve,2013-08-14 18:53:00,2075,its amazing how many young anglers he has influenced in his day.  a big loss to the fishing community.
803330,Garnet,2013-08-14 19:52:00,2056,I fished against Denny and Bruce tough tough competitors and I still miss the newspaper.
803795,Loonietoon,2013-08-19 00:43:00,1450,Was at the Funeral home Friday and was not surprised by the amount of friends that came to pay there respects. The slide show that was put on by the family only showed you 1/2 of Denny they could not find all that they wanted to show but it was still a great reminder of what a great friend and mentor Denny Was..   He will be missed...   Rest in Peace my Friend and Mentor
