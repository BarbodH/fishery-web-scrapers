803719,danc,2013-08-18 00:28:00,4677," You do realize that you drove right through Pike and Lake Trout heaven about 1/4 of the way on your journey up north? We use 6lb. mono for everything ""down"" here. No leaders. Flouro is just something that we read about on fishing forums. Apparently it's invisable to the fish?"
803722,dhickey,2013-08-18 01:35:00,1038,Nice catch  This morning I was thinking a canoe would feel safe out there it was so calm(NOT RECOMENDED!!!)  Glad to see you had a good day. Don.
803727,BillM,2013-08-18 02:19:00,17367,Perfect day to be out on Simcoe!   Good job man!
803730,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-18 04:26:00,10439,Spent over an hour fighting a large laker on Nipigon with light line before eventually losing it. I was fishing for brookies at the time with a 2/5 oz firetiger little cleo on 6# test. Best I could do with the fish in that hour was to get it 1 foot off bottom several times. The fish hit in Orient Bay trolling a 30-40 foot deep slot between an island and the main land.
803268,4x4bassin,2013-08-14 14:25:00,1025,"I do a lot of laker jigging and actually just got back from a trip . What I use is a braid main line and a 12lb fluro leader about 4ft long . I attach the leader to the main line with a good quality swivel to reduce any line twist . I tie the leader direct to the jig (less clutter on jig the better) . I wouldn't use any kind of mono , too much stretch . Even with this setup you still have to check your leader for cuts/nicks and re-tie, I lost a couple lake trout boatside this past weekend from getting lazy and not checking ! I use a baitcaster for this type of fishing , a lot better than a spinning outfit ."
803294,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-14 16:27:00,8243,"All good tips. I like to minimize terminal tackle as much as possible. No snap swivels casting or jigging, long lining a swivel is a must to reduce line twist, the smaller the better so a treble can't get hung up in the snap.  Do not cheap out on terminal tackle, I've seen many a trophy lost at the boat or hole when the snap pulled straight out. And swivels that don't swivel after a short time. Buy brand name tackle and the black snaps that lock over top and under the horizontal wire, not under a thin metal sleeve. They are crappola."
803321,davey buoy,2013-08-14 18:59:00,5505,"I have the micro swivels,which we'll use for the fluro connection. Some more discussion is needed on the snap swivel(which I believe to be ok)or tie directly to the bad boyz for instance.The snap swivel makes it so easy to change it up to a jig head or whatever."
803322,davey buoy,2013-08-14 19:02:00,5505,"To add,how about a live minnow to the bad boyz?,or should I stick to salted tubes/tails?"
803393,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-15 02:58:00,8243,"I have never used a snap swivel on a jig head. These must be very heavy jigs, I have never fished for lakers. The snap will change the action of the jig falling, especially a tube. I've snorkeled under water to watch. The tube doesn't spin as well on the fall. A jig is supposed to kick up the bottom when it hits, imitating a crab or foraging critter, it doesn't do that with a swivel attached as well. Also it will gather weeds where a smooth, bare  jig head won't as easily. Imagine jigging for 20 minutes to bring it up and it has weeds on it..  You have spent thousands on boats and equipment, accommodation and all that goes with it, and you want to put on a swivel because it's easy. Where are you going?take the time and tie on a jig man. Or buy the screw head jigs from Lindy. Have you ever seen a jig with a snap on it when those guys do a show?  How much time is wasted jigging with weeds on? We spend good money on tackle to imitate bait fish, I like to keep it as natural as possible.  My opinion only."
803403,davey buoy,2013-08-15 08:20:00,5505,Thanks guys for the tips and opinions.Gives us somewhere to start from.
803428,4x4bassin,2013-08-15 14:20:00,1025,"Ya , stay away from the snaps . As others have said lake trout are not picky when aggressive but for the amount of time it takes to tie on a jig it's just not worth it . As for the trailers , I have had very good luck with the Gulp minnows but i'm sure a live minnow would work well too .I have a couple reports a month or so ago showing my setups ! Good luck and remember they love to chase so keep that jig moving in the ""whole"" water column ."
803429,4x4bassin,2013-08-15 14:32:00,1025,"I found a picture of my favorite lake trout bait in the last month . Touched up darter head jig , 4"" gulp minnow  "
803479,davey buoy,2013-08-15 19:21:00,5505,"Ok,so if the finder finds fish in 60' for example.First of all it could be herring?,right?How would you know the difference?,or would you just fish that area and take a chance?.Saying the lake was 150' for example.Thanks for the info!"
803482,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-15 19:32:00,8243,"Jig at the depth the fish is, catch one and bring it up, then you will be able to see what it is. Sorry I'm being an ass.  I do have a question for you deep water jigging folks, do you use line counter reels this deep. How can you tell you are in the strike zone when fish suspended if you don't have a good HD sounder?  I want to start jigging for suspended Walleye on Erie, something I never heard anyone try with success here."
803485,davey buoy,2013-08-15 19:52:00,5505,"Good point,if I see the fish at a certain depth,without a line counter how will I know where I am?.Trial and error maybe ?lol.When it free spools to the bottom,how would you know?."
803486,Terry,2013-08-15 19:57:00,14456,"well if you are anchored or calm water you should be able to see your jig on your fishfinder  I jig the bottom 20 ft so I drop to the bottom, then bring it up however many ft I need when I can't see my jig"
803491,BillM,2013-08-15 20:53:00,17367,"OP, you're making this a lot  more complicated then it really is..   Unless it's dead calm (or you're anchored like Terry mentioned), marking your bait like you would through the ice can be a challenge.   What you need to do is stay intouch with the bottom and cover some water.     I'd worry more about marking fish, then my bait..  Find the fish, pound the bottom, you'll get bit."
803495,dhickey,2013-08-15 21:16:00,1038,I use a main line suited to the weight of the jig head tied to a small (quality) barrel swivel and then a lead tied to the barrel and jig.(no snaps) The main line can range from 6 -20 pound depending on the jig/depth/current and drift? And the lead will vary depending on the target fish?  I have several leads tied up in advance usually about 6-8 ft long this lets me change up quick and only tie one knot.  As for using the fish finder to locate your jig? 90-150ft? I locate fish first than hit bottom and work my way up.(touchy feely kind of thing)  Don.
803500,davey buoy,2013-08-15 21:33:00,5505,"Not rocket science Bill,but I feel the more I can learn,hopefully better returns  .It's just new to me."

803700,davey buoy,2013-08-17 22:17:00,5505,"Thanks to all that helped with my in depth questions lol.It paid off well.One laker 13lbs,another 7lbs,whitefish 6lb,and lost many others on lake X.A couple more pictures to come later.These fish were kept for table fare.  "
803701,misfish,2013-08-17 22:21:00,29133,Lucky bugger. You hit calm waters.  Nice fish Dave. And a couple of whities to boot.
803702,davey buoy,2013-08-17 22:23:00,5505,Here's a couple more!!  
803703,davey buoy,2013-08-17 22:24:00,5505,",best day everrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOL."

803705,Terry,2013-08-17 22:34:00,14456,nice going
803706,RickOnt,2013-08-17 22:39:00,669,Hey Davey  A very 'Nice' Day!!!  Is that an upgrade to Team #4 Whitefish?  Rick
803707,davey buoy,2013-08-17 22:45:00,5505,"It was 6lbs,and no tape measure..Even forgot my camera in the truck.These were taken from a friends phone.Would 6lbs do it?.This will not be the last trip out there.In all honesty,never occured to me We would have a day like that.Won't happen again for sure."
803708,RickOnt,2013-08-17 22:50:00,669,Davey  The 'Best' days always happen when ya forget the camera!!  LOL  Nice Fish
803136,davey buoy,2013-08-13 21:51:00,5505,"I know this has been talked about somewhat.All my reels are spooled with 8/30 pp.My question is,should you use a leader of some sort? Maybe mono,fluro etc.What would you recommend?We'll have bad boyz or equivalent,jig heads,minnows,salted tails of different colors etc.At that depth(100'plus)is braid good enough? Kind of want to put ourselves in the best odds of catching a fish or two. Thanks in advance."
803137,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-13 21:55:00,10439,I use a 3 foot section of flouro between the braid and lure for my laker fishing. I tie using a back to back UNI knot.
803138,limeyangler,2013-08-13 21:59:00,5204,"Braid is a good idea for deep fishing lakers.....get a better hook set (i.e. no stretch), like Drifter said....use a flouro leader of at least 3 foot. I like using micro swivels instead of line to line to reduce twist....but thats just me."
803139,davey buoy,2013-08-13 22:03:00,5505,What pound Fluoro would you recommend?.I use the micro swivels for steel heading as well.Not afraid of a back to back  uni knot as well
803142,BillM,2013-08-13 22:16:00,17367, Run what you do steelheading... 4-6lb Drennan or Phantom 5.6 or 6.6 is what I run if I'm jigging out on SImcoe.   No need to go crazy.
803143,davey buoy,2013-08-13 22:21:00,5505,"Some of the lakers the guys are showing,I would of thought something a lot heavier fluro would be needed.?"
803146,leaf4,2013-08-13 22:27:00,2466,"Went to Lake Ontario Sunday the smallest laker we got was 6 pounds and went up to 10, out of 8 fish 5 were 8-8.5"
803152,dhickey,2013-08-13 22:47:00,1038,Well if your jigging you might want to try the same approach I use ice fishing Just a thought.  Don.
803154,MJL,2013-08-13 23:01:00,2427,My only real experience with jigging lakers is on the ice. I have 8lb Berkley XL or 8lb Seaguar Senshi spooled on my reels. I run it straight to the lure. I think either would work OK as a leader. In the past I’ve tried 10lb PowerPro and an 8lb Maxima Ultragreen leader and caught fish as well.
803157,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-13 23:05:00,10439,I run 40# flouro.
803160,davey buoy,2013-08-13 23:18:00,5505,Same hardware I take it would be good for whitefish as well?Really hoping for one or the other in no particular order.lol.
803162,dhickey,2013-08-13 23:28:00,1038,We are not as fortunate as you Drifter.
803163,davey buoy,2013-08-13 23:32:00,5505,"I'll take his fish,but not his 6' of ice  ."
803167,dhickey,2013-08-13 23:41:00,1038,I think it goes hand in hand. Ill take the ice for fish hands down.
803169,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-13 23:46:00,10439,  
803202,Sinker,2013-08-14 01:38:00,8692,"I usually use a long leader on simcoe. About 10ft of 8lb mono. I use improved clinch-improved clinch, but any knot will work.  The trick is the jigging technique  S."
803203,dhickey,2013-08-14 01:58:00,1038,That works
803214,limeyangler,2013-08-14 02:21:00,5204,Only time you are gonna need 40# for lakers on open water is if you intend lifting the thing into the boat without a net.
803219,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-14 03:42:00,10439,
803222,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-14 04:08:00,8243,"I run braid on everything I own other than the ultralights for panfish and attach a leader of 17 pound Berkley Vanish with a micro chain leader.  The flouro is a must here on Erie as it's virtually invisible in the crystal clear water. I started with Vanish and swear by it for me. I'm sure I'm going to be schooled on other superlines but my budget and preference is Vanish.  The braid is great for deep water as it creates much less drag and really is a must for a hookset from any depth.  Mono is great as a backer and shallow water panfishing, maybe the latter. It would be like using a level wind knuckle buster and glass rod today with all the superlines available today would seem just silly. But that is my opinion and mine alone. I stillfish with my brothers ex father in law and he uses his old knuckle buster with the original nylon braid for smallies on the Maitland river, watching him finger the line with a shinner on it is really neat, he has perfected it over the last 80years, yes 80, he's 85.  What's not neat is watching him out fish me 3 to 1. So who knows, you can catch them or you can't.  And oh Drifter was that pic taken this week? Sorry but I'll fish the Florida Keys in Florida on a bad day over any great ice fishing day anytime while I can still stand on this great planet of ours. Just not in the DNA, the first time I went Italy to see where my grand parents came from I saw palm trees in Rome, I'll take palm trees over no trees any day."
803224,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-14 04:47:00,10439,I have no issues with fishing the salt either. I'm heading down to FLA in late February for 6 weeks in 2014.
803227,OhioFisherman,2013-08-14 05:29:00,6623, That's just wrong! LOL
803230,chris.brock,2013-08-14 08:13:00,4053,"I never liked having braid all the way to the bait (spoon or tube), I use a swivel, then 3 or 4 feet of mono (yeah, flouro would be better) as a leader"
803231,davey buoy,2013-08-14 08:27:00,5505,"Looks like fluro for the leader,now would you tie your line directly to the spoon/bait?,or would a small snap swivel be enough?"
803245,BillM,2013-08-14 11:33:00,17367,Snap for ease of changing up...  Lakers aren't picky.
