We figured well, hell if we go out fishing anyways why not enter it. Needless to say for the past week I have been hunting around trying to find out info on it. I chatted with frank at bridgenorth tackle and he informed me that this week its the tri lakes and not just chemong, but that's about all he had for me in terms of info. Just wondering if anyone has ever fished it before and could give me some info ie. what time, do I have to be a member of a club, (Peterborough bass masters perhaps, although there website didn't specify anything) just curious as to any info that could be given, I hear its fairly reasonably priced maybe 40 bucks, but any help would be appreciated . Thanks"

I think it is about $40/boat, but I have no idea who runs them.  I sent you a PM with the name of a member that has fished them.  He may have more info."
803420,mattybculp,2013-08-15 13:13:00,388,Thanks Dutch ! in the back of my mind I thought you may reply just from your avatar. I would like to join up with the Peterborough bassmasters. So hopefully I will see you around. Thanks again !

What I would reccommend if you are interested in joining is coming out to a meeting in the off-season.  We meet at Champs the first Tuesday of every month starting in October.  You can take a look at how we run and meet a number of the current members to see if it is something you might be interested in joining.  Depending on current member turnover some spots may open up from there.  There's also some info on our website:  http://peterboroughbassmasters.webs.com/"
