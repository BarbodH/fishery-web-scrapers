802932,Dan668,2013-08-12 22:46:00,1120,"Looking for a fishing net to use for bass. Normally dont use one, but have decided to get one for when trebles are involved. Any suggestions? Not sure whether to get a rubber or mesh net. Frabill has a mesh net coated which claims it stops tangling. The conversation series i believe."
802936,kickingfrog,2013-08-12 22:55:00,8333,"I don't often use a net, but when I do I use this one:  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Gold-Series-Folding-Landing-Net-with-Telescoping-Handle/product/10210368/  At least for medium sized pike, walleye and bass."
802941,Lape0019,2013-08-12 23:11:00,647,I use the rubber net. I love it because it doesn't tangle at all.
802944,Ainsley,2013-08-12 23:26:00,142,"I use an ego slider with a rubber net.  It's the shortest one and works well from shore or from a boat.  If I had to buy again I'd go for one with a larger basket, I have trouble getting some of the larger trout in it when fishing in the Niagara glen."
802948,craigdritchie,2013-08-12 23:33:00,1586,"Rubber net is hard to beat for avoiding tangles. It's the only way to go with crankbaits, Rapalas, or any time you're fishing at night IMHO."
802952,Dan668,2013-08-12 23:46:00,1120,I was looking at the ego but a previous friend had it and the shaft wasn't too sturdy. What size basket do you have?
802954,Ainsley,2013-08-12 23:51:00,142,I just have the kayak model I believe.  It's the smallest one.  Works well for bass
802970,Pigeontroller,2013-08-13 00:43:00,2793,"I have the rubber one that CTC sells...Love it, an Erie Smallmouth with a mouthfull of trebles is no place for a thumb!"
802993,dylan21,2013-08-13 01:42:00,22,"I have the frabil power stow net, its the 36"" slide model. The mesh is very good. Very few hooks get caught and if they do they come out easily."
803052,Rich,2013-08-13 13:09:00,3927,"I like a rubber net for bass, seems to make the whole thing 10 times easier and its gotta be easier on the fish. Obviously you dont need a huge net.. id go with the average sized rubbercoat one at your local shop."
803319,cityfisher,2013-08-14 18:43:00,959,+1 Rubber... use it religuously.. unless I hook a dink
803378,porkpie,2013-08-15 00:32:00,2521,"Bass pro sells a long handled rubberized net for $15.  It's excellent!  Good size basket, we have even had a couple of smaller incidental musky in that net.  It's a great pickerel, bass and pike net, and for the price you can't go wrong!"
803577,Beans,2013-08-16 15:50:00,3339,"I have a rubberized net by ""Lucky Strike"" and have netted good size bass, smaller sized lunge and 20 pound carp with it but I find it is too heavy for easy handling and not long enough even when extended when fishing from shore...  I now mostly use a bigger diameter net size on a extendable tent pole for carp...lighter and longer...am thinking I might get a rubberized basket-type net replacement for it one of these days but for now, it serves the purpose..."
