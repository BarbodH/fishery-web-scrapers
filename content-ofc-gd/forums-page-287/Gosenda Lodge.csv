It looked like they used Air Foleyet for the flight service.  Pine Lake is on the Nemegosenda river system north of Frog Lake.  I have not seen anyone discuss this outfitter.  Anyone know anything about it?          Thanks.

492437,adempsey,2010-08-08 07:54:00,1498,"Well, managed to find an old website for Air Foleyet.  The rates are for 1999, lol, so not sure if this is the current site or if it's still in operation.  Although, I came across a personal trip report/blog from this year, so I know someone is running that outpost.  http://reocities.com/yosemite/forest/5502/index.html  I fired off an email, so we'll see what happens."

Air Ivanhoe does the flying now.   You fly from Ivanhoe Lake into Pine Lake and boat down the river to the outpost.  Anyone have any other info?  Thanks!"

The website is outdated, but the phone number worked and the outfitter is still doing business.  You fly into the Pines outpost, load your boats, and travel down to the Chutes  Unless repeat clientele are keeping things going, this guy could use a new website.  I'm interested in this camp too, it's hard to dig up any information or reports on it."
