803392,Ron,2013-08-15 02:26:00,1683,"Gorgeous ski Lew. Then again, they are the only species on this planet I prefer big and fat!  Cheers, Ron..."
803406,lew,2013-08-15 10:43:00,12766,Thought I'd add this other picture of the fish when she tried to dislocate my shoulder just as the camera clicked. Tough to hold those big slimers still when they decide otherwise  
803407,TroutnMuskieHunter,2013-08-15 10:51:00,1362,Awesome Muskie Lew!!...I'm envious. She's a beauty
803412,wormdunker,2013-08-15 11:49:00,1711,Nice fish Lew?  In the last pic - who won the fight?
803414,woodenboater,2013-08-15 12:15:00,2277,Looks like you're thinking of throwing that beast over your shoulder for a fireman carry  can't imagine handling squirrely musky that size
803434,TJQ,2013-08-15 14:46:00,7806,Great self portrait!!
803448,Rich Clemens,2013-08-15 15:54:00,3131,That is one fat fish for sure.
803454,Hank Jr,2013-08-15 16:11:00,146,Real nice fish . No what you mean tough fishing my son and I fished the upper French where it empties in to the lake . Nice fish hard to get them to eat
803567,Mike Pike,2013-08-16 14:10:00,1332,"Wow, me thinks 'nice' would be an understatement.  Thanks for sharing that catch with us Lew.  She's a real beaut!  The smile on your face says it all!  Oh wait...  lol"
803585,lew,2013-08-16 17:48:00,12766," If I ever did smile in one of my reports Mike, you guys wouldn't have anyone to chuck bull at    edit to add.....Silly word censor"

803234,lew,2013-08-14 10:31:00,12766,"Mornin boyz, my wife and I are up at Lakair Lodge on the West Arm of Nippissing for a couple weeks looking for muskies.  I absolutely love fishing this body of water for muskies every June and August and although they take alot of work to get them, I'm fortunate enough to do quite well up here and usually get 1 or 2 nice ones each trip.  I got this pretty lady my 1st trip out on Sunday and she measured 51 inches and thought I'd share the moment with the rest of you musky nuts.  I was alone in the boat with the camera on a home made mount so the pictures not the best and some of the tail is missing, but it's not too bad.  "
803235,Roy,2013-08-14 10:40:00,13728,"WOW! A beauty for sure, Lew! Hope you and Diane are having a great time up there. Enjoy!"

803260,fishsevern,2013-08-14 13:23:00,112,"Nice fish big guy!  West Arm sure brings back memories. When I was 12-14 years old we did a couple weeks every year to the Welcome Lodge (beside Lucky Strike).  No idea if its still there but that area was my favorite to fish hands down.  Nice perch, wallys near the cabin, walking the shoreline through the woods catching bass/pike and my 1st musky 33"" came from there off a 1"" beetle spin.  My brother's perch picture was used in the brochure for the place, that was cool back then.  I will hopefully return one day  Thanks for sharing."
803267,NAW,2013-08-14 14:13:00,4022,Nice LEW!

803272,Musky or Specks,2013-08-14 14:59:00,2710,Beauty fish Lew. What lure and what technique were you using?
803273,mercman,2013-08-14 15:01:00,7054,Nice Musky Lew !! I was up on the Franny with Mike last weekend and the G.F. caught the musky of a lifetime as her first fish. Pics are lower down in the forum.

803283,kickingfrog,2013-08-14 15:29:00,8333,Thanks for taking the time Lew.
803293,lew,2013-08-14 16:26:00,12766," Thanks again folks, that fish came on a large black/orange spinnerbait.  I just got back to the cottage 30 minutes ago but lost possibly the very same fish earlier today. I was only about 100' off the spot and she hit as the bait splashed, gave a couple good headshakes, jumped 2 feet outta the water and threw the bait.  Oh well, it's good to see the fish win the odd tussle but I'll be going back for another visit this evening."
803296,cityfisher,2013-08-14 16:44:00,959,wow nice tank lew !!
