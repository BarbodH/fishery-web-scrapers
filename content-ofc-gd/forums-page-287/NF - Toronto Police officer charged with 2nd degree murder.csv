IMHO this will impact not only the copper and deceased's families but the families of many other civilians and officers because the second thought will cause a moment of indecision putting lives at risk""    I hope you are correct. Before lethal force is used, a second guess SHOULD be used.  I'm quite sure if this second guess was used in all cases, there would be more good as a result than harm.  This thread also makes me question just what will it take for a police officer NOT to take a side of a fellow police officer - I'm starting to wonder if it is even possible."
804071,Dozer,2013-08-20 17:32:00,896,"Pepper spray - taser - gun.  The kid was inside a bus - he wouldn't be able to breathe if they sauced the bus up with pepper spray.  If that failed, a good shock from the taser would straighten every single hair on his body.  The cop will be put on trial for the public to simmer down but nothing will become of it... the cop probably has some mental disorder or something and will get a reduced sentence, if that.  Now if the kid killed the cop with 9 rounds, oh boy - sentenced for life and then some - plus a good old beating from time to time behind closed doors.  The cop screwed up if you ask me and should be punished accordingly."

Fear does strange things to people in a time of panic.  Saw a thing one time where a cop had shot a guy that had a gun pointed at him, turned out that the gun wasn't loaded but the cop didn't know it. A reporter started getting mouthy about it and was asked by a senior officer how he would have handled it. The reporter replied ""well, first of all"" and the senior officer stopped him and said ""by then you or an innocent bystander could have been dead""!  I don't know what really happened or why he kept firing but that is for the courts to decide!"

It does not make it right what happened and two families have now been devastated by the actions of a stupid kid and a over zealous cop who should never be aloud near a gun ever again no mater what happens in the end. When this first happened I asked my 18 year old son what he thought and his only comment was what else do you expect a cop to do when you waive a knife in his face.  Now what would have happened if the kid lunged at the cops and killed one of them.  Then we would be asking why did they not just shoot him when they had the chance."

I say the kid had mental issues, the parents should have assessed this and done something about it.  We rely heavily on our teachers and police to parent our children, and always make them responsible when circumstance go bad.  id like to know if the ""kid"" was receiving psychiatric care, or what kind of boundaries he had as a disturbed teenager.   this situation could of went many ways, with the innocent kid stabbing and killing pedestrians on the bus to stabbing a police officer that was doing his job like everyone of us.

803900,BucktownAngler,2013-08-19 21:11:00,582,"A Toronto police constable charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Sammy Yatim will be arrested Tuesday based on an arrangement between Ontario's Special Investigations Unit and the officer's lawyer. After Const. James Forcillo turns himself in to the SIU, he will remain in custody and then appear before a justice of the peace at the Old City Hall courthouse, the SIU announced Monday after an arrest warrant was issued. Once he is in custody, Forcillo is eligible to apply for bail ""at any time,"" the SIU said in a news release.  The police watchdog is not revealing the location of the arrest because Forcillo has received threats, the news release says. A little more than three weeks after the shooting, the SIU announced the charge and arrest plan Monday, saying its director, Ian Scott, has ""reasonable grounds"" to believe that the officer committed a criminal offence. The SIU has not revealed any of its evidence. It is extremely rare for a murder charge to be laid against a police officer. After the charge was announced, Yatim’s sister, Sarah Ann Yatim, tweeted: “The SIU charged the cop with 2nd degree murder!!! Good morning JUSTICE.” So far, that has been the only response from the Yatim family, but it is scheduled to provide a written statement with its reaction at 4 p.m. A family friend said a news conference is expected to be held Wednesday. Toronto Police Association president Mike McCormack, who previously urged people not to jump to conclusions after watching a witness' video of the shooting, said the facts will emerge now that the case is going before the courts. “We’re very disappointed obviously in these charges,” McCormack told CP24 reporter Cam Woolley. “We’re not surprised but what we do is we stand by due process, and now that we’re into this process the charges are going to be before the courts. Let’s see where the evidence leads and let’s start talking about evidence and truth and facts instead of people just jumping to conclusions and having a subjective test and applying their own theories.” Yatim's family has been calling for justice since he was fatally shot on a TTC streetcar at Dundas Street West and Bellwoods Avenue early July 27. The 18-year-old man was wielding a knife inside the empty streetcar when he was shot by Forcillo, who was standing on the street with other officers near the streetcar’s open front door. In a cellphone video recorded by a witness, nine gunshots are heard during the encounter. Three shots are fired initially, followed by six more shots about five seconds later. In the video, it appeared the six additional shots were fired after Yatim had already fallen to the streetcar's floor. Police are heard repeatedly shouting “drop the knife,” and a male voice is heard apparently taunting the officers before the shots were fired. The sound of a Taser is heard after the gunshots. Witnesses said the streetcar came to a stop and people rushed off when Yatim brandished a knife. Police arrived a short time later.  Public outrage After the video was posted on YouTube and repeatedly shown on news broadcasts, public outrage erupted over the handling of the incident, along with allegations of excessive force. The officer-involved shooting led to protests attended by hundreds of people at Dundas and Bellwoods, Yonge-Dundas Square and in front of police headquarters on College Street. Forcillo, a married father of two young children, is suspended with pay, pending the outcome of the case. If convicted, a charge of second-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for at least 10 years. McCormack said the officer is ""devastated"" by the charge. “This has not been an easy process for him,"" McCormack said. ""It’s been a lose-lose situation for everybody, including our members who have to go through this.” McCormack said the incident impacts morale within the service, but his members are dedicated and professional officers who should not be judged as a whole because of the shooting. “Don’t use a broad brush to judge policing,” McCormack said. “This is one incident. Let’s judge that based on the evidence and the facts.” Toronto police declined to comment on the charge. Reviews underway In addition to the SIU’s investigation, Toronto police Chief Bill Blair is doing his own review to find out if the officers complied with the service’s policies, procedures and training, and Ontario ombudsman Andre Marin is reviewing the kind of direction the province gives to police for de-escalating of conflict situations. Retired judge Dennis O’Connor is assisting Toronto police in its review of its use-of-force guidelines while dealing with ""emotionally disturbed"" persons. The SIU is an arm’s length agency that investigates reports involving police where there has been a death or serious injury. Yatim family friend Joseph Nazar said he hopes no one else has to go through what the Yatim family is experiencing, as he called for changes to use-of-force tactics. “Sammy wasn’t a combatant,” Nazar said, “He wasn’t a threat to anybody’s life. He was alone in that streetcar.”  http://www.cp24.com/news/officer-charged-in-yatim-s-death-to-be-arrested-tuesday-1.1417157  there's a video on youtube of the incident. im sure most have seen it"

Most people saw Blair's statement the next day as basically saying the TPS messed up bad.

There are witnesses, they'll be questioned and we'll hear more as the case progresses. While I have to admitt it looks pretty bad on the police, for all we know he may have been reaching into his jacket....  However a 2nd degree murder charge says there is enough evidence to warrant a trial. The question I would ask is this, Are they laying charges because there isn't enough evidence to dismiss the case given the very public nature of the event and grass roots push for justice Or Is there enough evidence to suggest he's a crazy thug killing vigilante  It'll come out in the wash when it goes to trial I s'pose"

No camera inside the street car and in some of the footage he appears to still be moving in such a way that he looks like he's slashing with the knife.  Also... The TPS threw him under the bus to appease the public so that there wouldn't be a riot. The SIU charged him because of public pressure but he won't be convicted of second degree murder. He will be acquitted.  What this has done is put a second guess into every cop when a matter of lethal force happens... IMHO this will impact not only the copper and deceased's families but the families of many other civilians and officers because the second thought will cause a moment of indecision putting lives at risk

803958,Twocoda,2013-08-20 02:08:00,4130,Dave all due respect ...but seriously...this kid was sick... ...the prosecution should be going after every other officer for accessory to murder...if the shoe was on the other foot...everyone within a 500 meter radius of a downed officer would be going to jail...
803960,fishing n autograph,2013-08-20 02:11:00,2540,"Sick or not he had a knife. A mentally ill person with a knife is as dangerous as a normal person with a knife. A knife does more damage than a gun and is more accurate and lethal.  Anyway, I have seen the vids adnausium and armchair quarterbacked situation. Lots of things happened and didn't happen that night.  The stupid thing is that the cop walking with their back turned was the supervisor....  It's a terrible situation and yes it probably didn't have to go the way it did.  The videos don't show everything and I wasn't there.  Lives were ruined that night no doubt about it"
803961,Twocoda,2013-08-20 02:18:00,4130,the cops up here last month went into a mans house and tazered him to death...siu was called and dismissed it....if the person that was killed didn't happen to be the son in law of the former police cheif...( who went irate over the dismissal ) the case would have been put to sleep and forgotten....double standards ?. The case is open again for a second review....oh and all 5 cowboys that went in are all suspended with pay....the screening process is flawed as to who can and should be a cop...
