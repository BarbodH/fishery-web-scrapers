803599,MCTFisher9120,2013-08-16 22:15:00,3761,Awesome! Love largemouth bass especially when the heavy cover is around!
803600,misfish,2013-08-16 22:17:00,29133,"Sweet Rich.  Bass,n out of a dingy."
803606,Rich,2013-08-16 23:18:00,3927,"I'd take it anyday of the week over bassin off the bank.. or in a canoe for that matter. It's stable, quick, goes anywhere.. and zero emissions!"
803608,davey buoy,2013-08-16 23:31:00,5505,They sure are some nice Bass Rich!!!Gotta love it!
803625,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-17 04:25:00,8243,Show off. Have you named them all? I bet you've caught one more than once there!  Good going kiddo. You make us all proud out our way.
803639,Roy,2013-08-17 11:00:00,13728,Great looking fish. I think it's time for you to start getting a web show together.   Seriously.
803656,Musky or Specks,2013-08-17 13:33:00,2710,No matter what boat I'm in chances are there is emissions. Those are some nice hoggs. That one pic of your buddy looks like Indian Pond.
803662,highdrifter,2013-08-17 15:02:00,2534,Nice fish! You sure like that slop doncha boy!
803770,Rich,2013-08-18 21:15:00,3927,"Thanks everyone!  HD, actually only one of them was caught in any real slop, guess which one  hint it's my friend Brandon holding it .  MoS - not Indian, right next door..  And the lost pics:   Eric's shore beast on a buzzbait. Honestly, was a big big fish.. poor photo justice.   Too much photo justice.   A senko pike that surprised the heck out of us, smashing it in inches of water at Eric's feet.   Perfect photo justice."
803782,Whitespinnerbait,2013-08-18 22:53:00,2038,Some fine looking Buckets right there....
803785,Christopheraaron,2013-08-18 23:14:00,3525,Nice hawgs there! I've actually found that pike really like senkos if you get it close enough to them.
803858,highdrifter,2013-08-19 15:28:00,2534,LOL. Gotta love sloppy bassin.  cheers.
