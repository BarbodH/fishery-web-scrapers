803291,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-14 16:13:00,8243,"I was on my way into Hamilton to attend a retirement dinner when I noticed there weren't any stop lights. Went to my cousins bar where I was working a bit after retiring. We were the only bar around with power.  I had just retired the year before and had been doing failure analysis before leaving, I talked him into getting a generator and we had just had it installed.  The only bar downtown that I know of that had cold beer until it sold out. We saved many thousands of dollars in meat. And he sent my wife and I to MÃ©xico the next November as a bonus, gotta love it.  Scary part was my wife was in the air and couldn't land in TO or Hamilton, and I didn't know what airline she was on.  Seems like yesterday, 10 years, wow."
803292,backbay,2013-08-14 16:23:00,773,"In those days I worked downtown, 53rd floor of Scotia Plaza. I commuted to work on my bike, so once I got to ground level I was good to go."
803307,hutch4113,2013-08-14 17:31:00,374,"I was working near the airport at the time.  Was going to get gas on the way home - good call.  Anyway - went over to a co-workers house - it was like ""my big fat greek wedding"" - only Italian.  Because they had an extra guest - and I was a growing boy (30 ish at the time) extra food was made.  We had homemade wine - and my favorite - Grappa. His next door neighbour was a mechanic, and had a 10 gallon jerry can, which gave me enough gas to get home.  That part was the strangest, and most cool.  Bombing down the 400 to Barrie - no lights anywhere, and tons of cars pulled over at the Highway Gas stations, because they did not want to risk going any further. The thing I remember most though, was how active everyone was when I got home.  It was 11PM or so - people were out all over the place, walking/talking, etc.  Tells us a little something about the ""modern communication age"" we live in......"
803308,BillM,2013-08-14 17:36:00,17367,"Blackouts definitely get people off the couch    We could use one for a few days once a year like mentioned above, lol."
803310,DanD,2013-08-14 17:53:00,2223,"I/we didn't even know it had happened, we were at a fishing camp that week, West of Matachewan and it didn't have hydro service anyway. The wife wasn't too impressed; I had all the flashlights and Coleman lantern. OOPS sorry dear. LOL  Dan."
803371,tb4me,2013-08-14 23:57:00,3295,"We here in Brantford lost our power too..I remember cell phones werent working either..It was creepy..Anyway I found out that Scotland (the town of) not even 20 min down the road had power..Myself and 2 neighbours went got gas , Beer, ice and cash.. We were set for the next few days..."
803386,Tim Mills,2013-08-15 01:57:00,476,I was building a deck  around Jane and Bloor.  We initially thought our compressor blew the breaker then everyone started coming out on to the street and we knew it was bigger than that.  It was a  long drive back to the suburbs that night.
803458,Lunker777,2013-08-15 16:29:00,866,"I had invested appox 3 days of time into a fishing game on the PS3 .... I didnt have enough space on the memory card to save it, so i just left the console on for those three days.   I was in the middle of reeling in a big one ( lol fisher man dont lie ) and all of a sudden the power kind of dropped off, lights dimmed, fan slowed down etc..... it didnt go off, or flicker.... it was just like someone has started a huge fan or something. I kind of thought "" hmmm thats funny ??? "" ... .then all was fine for about 10-15 seconds then out it went.  Friends of ours own a driving range / ice cream / small restaurant, so when we realized the grocerie stores and variety stores had been picked over for hamburger buns , condiments , etc. We headed out there and had full range on ANYTHING we wanted .... so we took a few scoops of ice cream and a bag of buns and went home for a "" BBQ Fest"" as we called them. It was actually not that bad.  Except for the 3 days of missed work."
803556,steelhedrmatt,2013-08-16 11:05:00,278,"I went fishing out of the Bluffs for salmon. Launched in the dark. Pretty impressive sight to see the Toronto skyline when the whole city is without power. I think the fish were eating everything that day too, cause we smashed em that morning."
803558,Rich,2013-08-16 11:14:00,3927,"I was up north, no power, go figure. Didn't even know it happened."
803650,bucktail,2013-08-17 13:00:00,1857,I was sitting in the control room of the Oakville Water Plant watching my sites go black as the power went out. Not a good feeling!
803671,kickingfrog,2013-08-17 16:58:00,8333," Ya, that would have a fairly high pucker factor."
803182,kickingfrog,2013-08-14 00:17:00,8333,Time flies eh.  It wasn't too much of a hardship for me. My wife and I didn't have kids yet. We played cards and read by candle light. Went to bed early and had the next day off.
803184,Rizzo,2013-08-14 00:21:00,4754,remember sitting in my back yard in Toronto and being able to see stars!
803186,fishing n autograph,2013-08-14 00:42:00,2540,I was working that afternoon and was driving back from the Toronto Zoo.  My wife (gf at the time) was supposed to pick me up so that I could pick up my new car but needless to say that didn't happen lol
803188,dhickey,2013-08-14 01:00:00,1038,What black out? We had a great time(Rosemount). Made a swing set with the kids and enjoyed fires at night it was like camping with the family didn't even skip a beet as a matter of fact we had a 4 month old little girl and she loves getting away from all the luxuries that we take for granted.  Don.
803189,MCTFisher9120,2013-08-14 01:01:00,3761,"I was camping, didn't bother us one bit"
803190,sofabed,2013-08-14 01:03:00,119,"I spent the night and weekend  at work setting up generators operating a  a water system 500,000 people"
803192,dave524,2013-08-14 01:12:00,4508,"Live in Grimsby, we were below the big grid, didn't effect us cause we get our power directly from the DeCew Generating Station. The craziest part was word got out that we had power the gas stations went nuts cause we were the only area pumping for a many miles."
803193,Fisherman,2013-08-14 01:15:00,7201,"I was working dispatch that night,  one of the very few places that had power at the station.  Even the A/C was working."
803194,Ainsley,2013-08-14 01:16:00,142,I live in Niagara Falls and we never lost power in this part of the city.
803197,Handlebarz,2013-08-14 01:24:00,3790,We sat out in the back yard with the BBQ camp fire and cooked up all the food we had and drank all the beer we had so it would not go warm. Good times.
803198,leaf4,2013-08-14 01:25:00,2466,lol I was in Europe for 3 weeks during it never heard about it till I was home
803199,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-14 01:31:00,10439,I lived in Grand Valley. No issues there. We had plenty of power.
803207,Rod Caster,2013-08-14 02:01:00,5784,"Was living in a 'residence' at the time. I don't fully recall what I did, but I think it involved making a desperate run to the beer store to see if they were open, and they were....I guess that's why I don't fully recall"
803208,Richie Razor,2013-08-14 02:02:00,536,I was working retail while the rolling blackouts happened over the GTA. In the name of capitalism we stayed open and resorted to the old fashion credit card imprinting - remember those??? Lol
803213,NAW,2013-08-14 02:20:00,4022,"I was living near said 'residence' at the time.  I think I spent the entire time trying to find a girl to spend it with... Rather than sitting back an enjoying the silence.  Wow, things have changed a lot in 10 years!"
803215,Ron,2013-08-14 02:23:00,1683,"I was running around with portable pumps and set up several generators on the condos i maintain. I remember one gas station having a generator set up to service their pumps. Limiting people to only 20 liters. Good thing I knew the owner as I needed plenty to keep the submersibles and gennys running.  I still remember my youngest daughter saying that night... ""You know Dad, we should have this every year"". I agree with her."
803242,i2cool2fool,2013-08-14 11:21:00,349,I travelled from Toronto to my seasonal camper in Wasaga Beach then BBQ all the contents of my freezer like all other campers and had one heck of a potluck party!

Pretty crazy."
803256,fishindevil,2013-08-14 12:29:00,6254,"<p>i was salmon fishing on lake ontario,about 5 miles out of port darlington,and watched as the darlington nuke plant let out a huge mushroom cloud of steam.....not knowing we had a major power shutdown i thought the plant was having a meltdown,people were freaking out on the marine radio and we started to get the word from the other salmon boats......it was chaos and people started to panic cause of what we all seen from the nuke plant....but as we found out it was the reactors shutting down and getting flooded with cold water....it was scary when you didnt know what was happening......</p>"
803258,BillM,2013-08-14 12:41:00,17367,Should have stayed out in the lake!
803262,Toronto_Angler,2013-08-14 13:31:00,698,"It was horrible..I was supposed to come home from my greek vacation, instead my flight was postponed for 3 days so I had to bide my time by going to the beach, eating and drinking with friends for 3 more days....By Horrible I meant awesome."
803274,Musky or Specks,2013-08-14 15:04:00,2710,One of my fondest memories. My son and I were camping on an Island in the French River area for 10 days. We came out and everyone was like black out and my son and I were hmm didn't notice.
803278,Garnet,2013-08-14 15:12:00,2056,I was at work in a battery factory.  You couldn't see to the end of your nose. We had safety lights but we couldn't get to them until somebody got a flashlight to lead us out.  Sat around for a bit outside then went home.
803280,Lunkerhunter,2013-08-14 15:13:00,455,"i was in the hospital, broke my ankle in 4 places and had a plate and screws put in. great time. lmao"
