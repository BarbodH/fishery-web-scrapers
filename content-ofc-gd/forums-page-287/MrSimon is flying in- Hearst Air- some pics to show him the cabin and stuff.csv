803460,adempsey,2013-08-15 16:36:00,1498,Decent looking cabin.  Thanks for posting those.  I always like to see what the outposts look like.  Quantz has been on my radar for a while.  Hopefully I will get up there one day.
803467,MrSimon,2013-08-15 17:41:00,217,Thanks!  Nothing like getting excited for a trip that is over a year away  I'm assuming you took in your own axe?  And it looks like the seating situation is pretty limited .... we can take in camp chairs - shouldn't be too heavy.  That leech is gross.  I don't think I would have been so easy going about it as you.
803553,solopaddler,2013-08-16 10:22:00,8605,I was going to suggest you contact Chris through OFC when you switched from Wanzatika to Quantz. You're way ahead of me! By all accounts you picked a good one.  (99.9% sure Hearst will have an axe at all of their outposts)   
803813,moparhawk,2013-08-19 02:12:00,146,Awesome and way to catch your own bait too!
