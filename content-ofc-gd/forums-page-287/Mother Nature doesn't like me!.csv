802679,Big Cliff,2013-08-11 13:00:00,6899,"Ok, so in the past couple of years;  11 years ago a storm came through here and tore some tarps off our roof when some contractors were doing renovations for us and at 3 am we were filling buckets of water from the leaks in the roof, we had a bunch of water damage.  5 years ago a storm took down a huge Manitoba maple and caused quite a bit of damage to our garage.  last winter I put my ice hut out on Saturday. Saturday night 90k+ winds relocated the ice hut, I found it two days later all smashed up.  This spring a storm took down a huge pine tree, unfortunatly my beautiful deer stand was attached and ended up under the pine tree in a pile of rubble. I had spent hours building that deer stand and putting a roof on it so I could finally be comfortable when I went deer hunting this fall.  This summer, the first time Sue and I have had a vacation in years, a storm destroyed our boathouse. It ended up in the neighbors yard on it's side. We ended up having to cut our vacation short and coming home early. It is going to cost thousands of $ to fix (thank god for insurance).   All I want to know is what the heck I did to tick her off?"
802681,Canuck2fan,2013-08-11 13:20:00,1444,"Wow that is a horrible string of weather calamities... Seems like the weather is getting worse all over Ontario too. I had a huge branch that would of totalled my car fall just a foot from it Thursday night. I have never seen winds that strong from that direction in the 15yrs I have lived here, mainly because the surrounding buildings usually block wind from even hitting the tree not this time though."
802682,Beans,2013-08-11 13:29:00,3339,"You my friend would be what my old pappy used to say about me...  ""You'd be bad luck to a good hunting dog !!!"""
802684,ketchenany,2013-08-11 13:39:00,3229,You my friend are too kind. I say sacrifice something on the dock to appease the gods!  If that doesn't work move to Woodbridge so we can fix things.  Sorry to hear about your loss
802689,Joey,2013-08-11 13:55:00,9122,God is just trying to keep you busy so you stay out of trouble Cliff
802694,landry,2013-08-11 15:35:00,1005,That is rough. Your poor boat. And I remember it was a nice one. Is it a write off too? Landry
802695,Ralph Field,2013-08-11 15:42:00,1018,"If I didn't have bad luck,I wouldn't have luck at all. You seem to be described by this old saying."
802696,Big Cliff,2013-08-11 15:42:00,6899,"LOL no, as bad as it looks, the boat ended up being fine. The marine railway protected it. There were a few small rubs on the side of it from the kayack I was storing for a friend but I've seen lots of worse cases of dock rash. I lost a bit of gas but that was it!"
802697,Sinker,2013-08-11 15:53:00,8692,I saw it from the water last week Cliff. Brutal.  Glad the boat is ok though.  S.
802701,Richie Razor,2013-08-11 17:27:00,536,Brutal. Perhaps move?
802704,Terry,2013-08-11 18:15:00,14456,oh man
802718,irishfield,2013-08-11 19:43:00,26272,"Well at least it's just Mother Nature that's after you Cliff! Still sucks, but I can deal with that one!"
802752,captpierre,2013-08-11 23:02:00,2521,Look on the bright side.  A new boat house!  for what $500 deductable?
802754,porkpie,2013-08-12 00:15:00,2521,Sorry to see your troubles!  You seem to have had a bad run!  Here's hoping the weather is kinder to you in the future!
802818,crappieperchhunter,2013-08-12 13:47:00,2582,    I think Joey has it figured out Cliff
802823,b2kptbo,2013-08-12 14:13:00,1505,"WOW, having been to your place I couldn't believe that could happen with out seeing the picture. Glad on one was hurt, if there is anything I can do for ya let me know..."
802911,motv8tr,2013-08-12 21:41:00,2587,Dang!!!
802915,Twocoda,2013-08-12 21:51:00,4130,if your not going to bolt the next boat house down at least tie a string to it so you can fly it ....at least father time is being good to you
803125,Big Cliff,2013-08-13 20:51:00,6899," That is a really good point, hadn't thought about it that way, guess I was feeling a little too sorry for myself. Thanks for pointing that out because you are so right!!!"
803757,northernpike56,2013-08-18 18:20:00,717,"Poor boat. That pic looks nasty.  Does your insurance go up when you claim something like that? And do you write the smaller things off such as your ice hut and deer stand too, or just take the blow out of your pocket?"
803760,Roy,2013-08-18 19:30:00,13728," If your insurance premiums rise in cost because of a claim, it's no longer called insurance. It's called a medium term loan."
