We got to spot one and we could already see one that was well over 30"", but try as we might he would not hit, although he did take a look at a senko and fly. So we kept walking and found a few more fish, had one pike on but lost him, saw another giant and that was about it for the pike. By then it was midday and my friends had had enough for one day, I stayed behind to try for some carp. About a half hour later I had the pleasure of fighting this brute on 6lb line. When I went to net her she actually snapped the net in half (kind of my fault), measured 32"" and had to be 30lbs.    On a side note we kept seeing a school of fish which none of us could identify. They were about 1-2lbs, swam in a group of roughly 20 fish and looked to be spawning. At first glance they look like a cross between a bighead carp, silver carp and cisco, any idea to what they may be?"

803744,BillM,2013-08-18 16:50:00,17367,"Nice carp, but I think your 'weigh scale' might be a bit faulty"
803745,Roy,2013-08-18 16:51:00,13728,"Nice fish Christopher, Congrats!  Could those other fish have been suckers?"
803746,Ralph Field,2013-08-18 16:52:00,1018,That is a big carp on 6 lb. line.
803747,Christopheraaron,2013-08-18 16:52:00,3525,"LOL, it was a guess. I think I figured out what the fish was, gizzard shad."
803748,Christopheraaron,2013-08-18 16:52:00,3525,"they were too tall for suckers, we considered it."
803749,Roy,2013-08-18 16:57:00,13728,"Yup, gizzard shad makes sense.....they happen to be spawning in shallows now also. Adults are 10""-14"" so that would put them in the size range as well."
803750,misfish,2013-08-18 16:58:00,29133,Well done dude.
