Too many times I would buy at the last minute and scramble to find a place that sells it.Now its on line and for 3yrs.  On the bright side my Quebec licence is good until March 31st 2011.

532752,ckrb2007,2010-12-30 00:07:00,449,I was at the CTC in the south end of Barrie a few days ago and they said they wouldn't have any until the new year....but I heard through the grapevine that Robinson's Hardware in the northeast side of Barrie has them.  The only reason I got mine at LeBarons is because I work close by.  Colin

532856,Cudz,2010-12-30 05:50:00,2652,"I tried to buy at south side barrie ctc and they said not until at least 1st week of jan.  I went online to renew card and get one year licence but I could not get a one year and was forced to get a 3 year.  I know it is a better deal but was not in the budget.  Oh well, always easier to ask for forgiveness then ask for permission. PS.  Glad to hear you are going to get out this year.  Make it a priority!"
532858,Garry2Rs,2010-12-30 06:42:00,1425,I got my Seniors card. That means I never need to buy a fishing license again.
532865,scugpg,2010-12-30 12:18:00,1373,Does sprawl-mart have them in stock yet? Not that it matters unless I'm getting the boat out this weekend with all the warm weather coming.

533294,SmokestackLightnin,2010-12-31 17:50:00,390,I did the online renewal even before my notice came from the MNR.  My 3 year fishing and small game arrived in the mail the first of December.
