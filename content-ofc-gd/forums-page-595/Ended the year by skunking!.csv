Got out for 2 hours on the 30th and 1 hour on 31st.  fishing was slow the first day, but was not expecting the skunkypoo to raise its ugly head the second day. Oh well thats fishing.  Kinda should have known it was gonna happen as everything was going wrong yesterday, snowblower broke, broke an expensive tie down, my buddy showed up with his plow just as i finished snowblowing in 35kmh winds after spending 2 hours fixing ignition on snowblower....then a skunk?...should have known ...lol  still fishing deep,jigs and minnows, still getting walleye suspended at 20'FOW over 50'FOW,just nothing on the second day. A few fish did show on screen, but did not matter what i tried...they weren't interested.  Trout fishing tomorrow   Here's the vid for the 30th Dec with my buddy in my flip-up. Darn nice to have the heater...it was freeeeeezing that day.   <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4eeTh1X-E?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4eeTh1X-E?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-4eeTh1X-E?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""640"" height=""385""></embed></object>"
