May we have many special moments on the water where we share a common bond. May we experience the early morning mist, and those short periods each day when mother nature inspires all her creatures with a joy of life and when the fish all seem to be biting at once and magic is definitely in the air.  At those moments, may we reconnect in our own special way with those we keep close in our hearts.  All the very best for 2011 !!!"
