The are very hard to find in the US but are sometimes available fresh, dried, or canned. The bean is available in a variety of colors including white (flagolet blanc), black (noir), yellow (jaune), red (rouge) or green (vert).  Flageolet beans are traditionally served with lamb.Theres yer sign.LAMB.  He got us on the Flageolet,but Im sure I,ll get him on the creamdala green peas 2morrow.LOL"
