533633,Handlebarz,2011-01-01 22:04:00,3790,Nice lookin ride guys and that second driver is a hottie.  Good luck on the hard water
533636,irishfield,2011-01-01 22:05:00,26272,Yah better make that driver Mike... lol
533647,carll2,2011-01-01 22:51:00,443,"   the riser is stock on all expedition models...the expedition is made for deep powder and back country riding with its riser,20 inch wide track and wide skis up fornt"
533656,skeeter,2011-01-01 23:13:00,1907,"Joey, did you remember to get the sticker for the plate on the sled? even if only using it on the ice you still need it and insurance.  i know you know that but its just a reminder for EVERYONE."
533662,Joey,2011-01-01 23:36:00,9122," Yes Skeeter, thanks.  Had the insurance on it before I even picked it up, and they did the plate/sticker for me!"
533684,Handlebarz,2011-01-02 01:04:00,3790,  Wayne when your typing with one... Ahh never mind I just fixed it LOL.
533685,Handlebarz,2011-01-02 01:06:00,3790,  One other good reason to get it before it makes it home is you are covered when someone steals it the first night home I have seen it a few times when I lived in Sudbury guys bring there new sled home leave it on the trailer over night and gone in the am before they can get to use it.
533848,LeXXington,2011-01-02 16:27:00,1928,"Very nice ride, Congrats"
534247,corvette1,2011-01-03 17:22:00,1765,congrats on the new toy looks awesome
534250,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-03 17:27:00,2690,"Wow, nice ride!!  I must have missed this post when you put it up a couple days ago.  Bring on that ice!"
534260,Leecher,2011-01-03 18:42:00,7832,Sweet ride Joey Congrats to the both of you Leechman
533366,Joey,2010-12-31 23:35:00,9122,"Well, I finally gave in, Paul beat me down and I am defeated, he got the sled he wanted  Well I kinda like it too.  Picked the trailer up Wednesday and the sled today.  Gonna be a great ice fishing season                  "
533367,Grimace,2010-12-31 23:41:00,2020,Excellent choice.  Beautiful sled. Congrats
533369,lew,2010-12-31 23:42:00,12766,Your riding in style now girl !!
533370,irishfield,2010-12-31 23:43:00,26272,So.. New Years day he's gonna be building guide ons.. tie downs... auger mount..
533371,mercman,2010-12-31 23:43:00,7054,"Sweet looking ride !!!!  The view from the front makes it look like a panther ready to pounce. Congrats to you both, and happy new year..   Paul"
533373,Bernie,2010-12-31 23:47:00,3190,"Nice Sled Joey.  I think in all fairness, you should get to drive."
533374,Terry,2010-12-31 23:48:00,14456,"I got some good news and I got some bad news   the good news, that thing is sweeeeeeeet nice trailer too   the bad news the lake is so icy and slippery , skidoos can't run on it without flipping over ....lOL"
533375,BUSTER,2010-12-31 23:50:00,1336,
533380,misfish,2011-01-01 00:10:00,29133,Sweet ride guys.
533382,Nipfisher,2011-01-01 00:13:00,2449,"I am guessing it was not right out of the crate with the # 42 and after-market riser on it. If you are not doing any extreme powder riding then I would take it out. You won't need to shorten the cables and it could be added back on afterwards. It is a beautiful sled and I wish I owned one but you will find the ride better, more comfortable and easier to handle if you remove the riser."
533383,Fisherman,2011-01-01 00:13:00,7201,There's only one thing missing...where's its sister for Joey?
533385,Dondorfish,2011-01-01 00:16:00,1000,  The snowmobile IS for Joey - the armrests are for paul!!   Awsome machine guys - what size motor?   Tracker (D0n)
533390,Terry,2011-01-01 00:21:00,14456,I think there are 2 different motors for that one I will guess the 600 but it could be the 4 stroke 1200   
533396,lunkerbasshunter,2011-01-01 00:26:00,2585,wow what a good looking machine!  Enjoy it!  Cheers!
533397,Bernie,2011-01-01 00:26:00,3190,That one is the 600.
533403,Joey,2011-01-01 00:32:00,9122," Hahaha, no that's Yamaha's remember Terry    Yep, you got it right Tracker    Thanks guys, and yes it is a HO 600 STI, and no not out of the crate.  Paul is considering taking the riser off, we'll see how it handles first I guess."
533411,aplumma,2011-01-01 00:46:00,6896,Nice ride... try it with the riser before you get rid of it. It looks like it keeps you straight up and down instead of hunched over.   Art
533414,Fish Farmer,2011-01-01 01:02:00,2234,"Congrats on the new machine  . The Whities don't have a chance now. That trailer would make a nice fish hut, just need a couple holes in the floor and your good."
533415,limeyangler,2011-01-01 01:07:00,5204,"OMG  That is friggin awesome Joey! I just finished reading your post about the MTO, then CT. They are all MUPPETS!  However, i would go through all that 10 times to own a sled like that. I'm drooling into the keyboard, my XLT was bought when i knew little about sleds, not the best for breaking trail or deep snow, but that sled you got will go through anything, the beast will glide/float/fly over slush.  I cant bare it, i haven't even got the strength left to mention that awesome trailer!  Very happy for ya both, i'd say enjoy, but that would be redundant....anyway...i'll say it...ENJOY!   PS....Happy New Year to you and Paul.  Simon.  (oh, Jack also saw the picture...he's on my lap screaming ""SNOWMEAN!"""
533470,Jds63,2011-01-01 06:03:00,1365,"very nice , congrats"
533471,Carp,2011-01-01 06:10:00,1488,Very nice machine & trailer too. Congrats on the new ride.
533532,nofish4me,2011-01-01 16:54:00,404,"I can really appreciate your new ride. Would love to have had it back when...... I finally got over my affair when I was almost 10 miles (yes, miles) from home and hit something in the ditch. I pulled out on to the road and ""High Tailed It"" for home. This was after dark and the steady stream of sparks from the skis, was impressive. I parked the sled and sold it. There wasn't the trail network there is now or maybe I would still be into it. Nice ride and have fun."
533543,skeeter,2011-01-01 17:31:00,1907,"Very nice set up. both the sled and the trailer!  what you do need is a set of ski guides from Royal Distributing for the trailer. the carbides will tear the crap out of the floor, and it will help paul from hitting the walls LOL. a trailer hitch and a sleigh with a rigged tow bar, for your fishing gear or Paul depending on your mood Joey---  oh dont forget about a cover for the sleigh or it will fill up with snow."
533560,Joey,2011-01-01 19:05:00,9122," Thanks, Paul's already out there doing all that right now"
533587,Rob,2011-01-01 20:14:00,467," Great sled Joey and Paul, That sled will last you for years if you maintain it every year.  Great Choice!   Rob C"
