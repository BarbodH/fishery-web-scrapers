533272,GBW,2010-12-31 16:54:00,8460,"Hey all.  Just an FYI for those that are looking for a new sled for ice fishing, CTC has these on sale Snow Trek 45 Sled right now for 40% off.  Whitby North store has about 20 left.  Oh and Happy New Year too.  Geoff"
533274,Headhunter,2010-12-31 17:04:00,5703,"Thanks for the heads up... I got out early this morning  and picked one up. It's a little smaller than I wanted, but I think it will work for me. And Happy New Year to all! HH"
533276,SBCregal,2010-12-31 17:10:00,688,"good heads up.  i was looking to get one of those, but saw the size and went with the 60"" instead.  more room than i need now, but hey...bigger is better right?  FWIW lebaron's regular price on the 45 is around 27 bucks, the 60 costed 49 iirc   ryan"
533295,toca,2010-12-31 17:50:00,274,with the 10 percent discount card at lebaron you only pay approximately 2 dollars more than the CTC sale(after taxes).
533297,Governator,2010-12-31 17:54:00,879,"I just returned that sled the other day, I got both that and the 60 for xmas.  60 is much better imo, bigger & more sturdy."
533306,GBW,2010-12-31 18:34:00,8460,"I know you were out, I called to see if you had seen the flyer...  LOL"
533310,kickingfrog,2010-12-31 19:01:00,8333,Thanks for the heads-up.  I hadn't looked at the flyers yet. I just got (1:30pm) the second last one (at least out on the floor) at the north Barrie store.
533424,GoneFishin,2011-01-01 01:28:00,349,I have 2 snow trek 45's that I would gladly trade for something bigger.
533440,GBW,2011-01-01 02:44:00,8460,"for the one or two times a year I will use it, it's good for me.  I have my hut and other gear but trying to make it a light load for me when I need it, and others.  Sorry for passing on the sale and stock level info."
533462,GoneFishin,2011-01-01 04:29:00,349,Sorry wasn't trying to bad mouth them. They are good sleds and I bought mine last year when they went on sale. I just have way to much equipment and if I go out alone it's hard to pull two sleds.
533467,GBW,2011-01-01 05:33:00,8460,"my reply wasn't at you, just in general.  Have a good one."
533478,Victor,2011-01-01 07:15:00,1609,"thanks for letting us know GBW.  I actually picked one up myself at lebaron this morning without knowing about the sales at CTC, it's only a buck or 2 difference anyway. Perfect size for me since I just started out and have limited amount of gear.  happy new year all!"
