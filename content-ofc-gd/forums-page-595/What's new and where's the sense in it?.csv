533980,SlowPoke,2011-01-02 21:58:00,2984,"I think we're all guilty of embellishing our memories. I remember watching a movie with my parents, The Poseidon Adventure. For years it was one of my favourite movies and I recall the family sitting down eating that Jiffy Pop popcorn watching on 25"" colour TV... one of those 'big' Electrohome console models. Years later I was channel flipping and come across the same movie. I probably smiled with fond reflection and watched the movie. About ten minutes later I changed the channel. My fond memories had nothing to do with the movie, the Jiffy Pop or the Electrohome. It was just a great moment in time that I can look back on but never recreate. There's nothing wrong with thinking about the good ole days as long as we keep making new memories. And you're doing it with style!"
533987,mercman,2011-01-02 22:28:00,7054,"Now ya got me going. I used to have a Zebco spinning reel and a garcia rod.Paid alot back then.39.99 for the reel, and 29.99 for the rod.Back then all i was interested in was how it felt in my hands.Had a tackle box with some rapallas and a few arbogast poppers,a couple of daredevils and a johsons J-plug.Caught all kinds of fish on them.Abot 10 years ago, i figured i'd probably never fish again, so i threw everything away. Last year when i decided to return to fishing, i was totally shocked at what had happened since i had been gone. I had never even heard of a fish finder, and baitcasters were for the Pro's. I have 3 rod/reel combos now, carefully chosen to alow me to fish most of the species i want to, along with lures and tackle.I was given a sonar when i got the boat, but i am a technonut,so i went last week and got a new one with GPS.Its hard as heck to know when enough is enough,and i have a hard time not adding something to my tackle box every time i shop."

533887,JohnF,2011-01-02 18:20:00,3494,"Great post.  With some of my other hobbies (diving, golf, etc) gear piggery was a major problem. There were always some nifty new pieces of ""must have"" gear and I was a sucker for all of it. I couldn't go diving without the back of my van being loaded with boxes and tanks and suits. Typically I'd have enough gear to put 3 people in the water well-equipped. That's ridiculous ........ but fun, dammit.  Naturally I've gone at fishing the same way since I rediscovered it a few years ago. I was just down in the storage cage the other day sorting out rods and reels. I have more than 18 setups of which I really only use 4 or 5 for different situations. Ironically when I head out to the river which is my most frequent fishing happening I'll be wading so of course I need to strip down to the essentials. I carry one rod and everything else goes in a small canvas bag over my shoulder. The hemostats and clippers are on a light bungee around my neck. The license and cam are in the bib pocket of my waders. I'm the poster boy for minimalism as long as no one sees my storage room.  Instead of having threads talking about species specific rods, reels, lines and lures let's all try to identify the gear that is most generically successful in it's application.  FIGHT BACK!!!!!!!!  JF"
533889,JohnF,2011-01-02 18:27:00,3494," It all started with cars and clothing. My grandpa had one good suit and one work suit. He removed the vest and jacket when he got home at night and put on a cardigan over the shirt and tie. Once the work suit wore out the good suit became everyday and a new one was purchased for Sundays. They were always grey. I was told that was why old houses didn't have huge closets - no clothes to fill them. Today my wife and I each have a huge closet full of clothes for dressup, work, play and laying around the house. It's crazy.  And why do we need to change cars every 3 or 4 years?  JF"

Now,  I spent all of 2010 refining my tackle, I used to be the one to have a $2000 tackle box, lol, now, it has about $200 worth in it and I caught more fish, and higher quality fish this year than ever before. One thing is for certain, I'll never go fishing with jigs, grubs, live minnows and snap swivels, EVER! For cranks its nothing more than a few DT's and xraps.  Now, I also spent all year trying new rod/reel combos, and never been so frustrated with the gear. The rods are fine, with that I'm not picky, but for the life of me I can't find a spinning reel that doesnt break of malfunction after 2-3 months of heavy fishing.  When I was a kid, I had an ugly stik with a rapala reel, seriously, that rod has been fished a thousand times, still have it, and it still works(my son now uses it). It's 23 years old, haha.  Why cant I find a rod/reel combo like that now??????"

533945,craigdritchie,2011-01-02 20:33:00,1586,"Back in the 70s I was given a tour of the Abu Garcia rod manufacturing plant, back when they still made their rods in the USA. Old timers might remember that back then, the fishing rod lineup started with the entry-level Blue Series rods. Above them, and priced about 50 percent higher, was the green coloured  Avacado Series, followed by the upper-level Brown Series rods. Remeber them? If not, you may be able to google it. Top-of-the-line, if you had the money, was the prestige Black Series.  All rods had similar guides, reel seats, cork grips and metal ferrules, so the colour of the blank was how you told the serious guys from the beginners.  Problem was, they all used exactly the same blank - just painted different colours. Cheapie Blue Series rods sold for $19.95, while top-of-the-line Black Series rods were $49.99 to $59.99 - big money in those days.  The only thing different was the colour.  No one wanted the crappy Blue Series rods. Everyone spent more money for the otherwise identical Avacado, Brown or Black rods.  Nothing's changed today."
533947,lew,2011-01-02 20:40:00,12766," You've got me figured out pretty good Brian   and I guess I can't disagree with you.  It sure is nice flying across the lake at crazy speeds while we're picking out our spots on the GPS as were listening to Sirius radio and thinking about which too expensive rod and reel combo to use when the sonar shows us where all the fish are sitting.  I often wonder though, if fishing wasn't actually more fun, or relaxing, back before we had all the fast boats and very expensive gear & gizmos to go along with it.  Fishing today is still fun but I think we're sometimes too pre-occupied with our toys, our speed, and out Jonesing everybody we know and we forget what it's really all about.  ....or maybe I just spend too much time thinking about the good ole days"
533951,solopaddler,2011-01-02 20:52:00,8605," I remember those ABU rods Craig, I saved up for one of the avacado ones when I was a kid.  Drove my bike from Carlisle to Waterdown (long way for a 10 year old) to pick the rod up at the hardware store where I ordered it. "

I used that rod and reel for everything .... crappies under docks with jigs and a float, walleyes on Mepps spinners with a worm, largemouth in slop with weedless spoons, smallies on topwaters, even steelhead and cohos, when I would skip school and spend my days at the Humber and Credit. I caught more fish on that single rod and reel than I can even begin to remember.  Of course it was waaaay better than the Blue Series rod my buddy had  :-)"

Most of the new product centre around recurring themes: New smaller, lighter reels with even more bearings and higher gear ratio's... Sort of Carter Burden meets fishing... ""You can never be too thin, too rich, or have too many books."" becomes ""You can't have too high a gear ratio, be too small or have too many bearings.""  Rods for slightly different tactics or presentations... Worms but not Jigs on this one, Spinnerbaits but not Cranks here...Top waters and Frogs on that one...no wait...was that one Jerkbaits and C-rigs...Sometimes you just can't tell the players without a program!!! More rods that are Species Specific... What was I thinking? I can't chase bass with a walleye rod!!! And of coarse the latest can't miss baits! I haven't seen so many ""New and Improved"" that looked like the ""same-old in a new wrapper"" since my last trip to the laundry soap aisle at the Super Market!  It reading the comments and viewing the testimonials I began to recall the theory of the""Big Lie.""  Richard Belzer defines The Big Lie, in his book UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don't Have To Be Crazy To Believe, this way:  ""If you tell a lie that's big enough, and you tell it often enough, people will believe you are telling the truth, even when what you are saying is total crap."" In fishing terms I think that's sort of like the benefits of Fluorocarbon...  Then the latest must-have fads:  Reels with ""go-fast"" paint jobs.  Mini Guides. Do they come with a needle threader?  And even more Split-Grips. Does anyone else get those end knobs tangled in their jacket???  As kids weren't we catching fish on garden worms?  Wasn't hi-tech a neon coloured rod?  When were we seduced into believing we needed ten shapes of plastic creatures, in eight colours, swing from $500.00 worth of space-age materials just to do the same job?  Okay, the truth is I need all this new stuff because the bass on my waters have a higher grade-point average than most College Freshmen, but I doubt that you do...HAHAHA"

I for one have tried to keep my heels dug in over the years and not give into the dark side but there are some things out there that surely make life a lot easier so I would be a hypocrite if I said I never used special application reels and rods,not used flourocarbon tippets on my steelhead rigs and the odd spool of power pro on a muskie pole. I think everyone has their limitations or is it just me ?? Personally,I enjoy a river walk with my fly rod and a box of hand tied flys.

Over the last 10 years I have been building a huge collection of fishing gear, at last count 19 rod and reel combinations, so much tackle that I had to have 4 different tackle boxes (and needed more).  The one thing I did add last year though was my HDS5 and I have to be honest with you I REALLY like it for several reasons. The GPS for navigatiing, the charts with contours, the detail, and the sensitivity.  Last year I started off having a really hard time finding and catching walleye, I tried everything in my tackle boxes (and several suggestions from other people) with very limited success.  Finally in frustration I went right back to basics; things I use to use 30 years ago and all of a sudden I started boating walleye again. (actual count, 186 walleye boated in the last half of the summer)  This year I am going to reduce my rod collection to 6 rods (2 ice fishing, 1 long rod, 1 ultra lite, 1 sensitive and 1 with good back bone)  I am going to reduce my tackle collection to 1 box and go back to mono on all my rods.

Truth is there are 2 types of people the fishing industry looks at.1) Fisherman who  just get out to fish for simple pleasure, Who wil not generate huge profits 2) the ""tackle tart"" who must have every latest gadget  and gizmo on the market.

533829,Fish Farmer,2011-01-02 15:39:00,2234,"Tell a fisherman anything about catching a fish on a certain lure and they'll go by a dozen. Fisherman aren't the sharpest hooks in the box. A million lures later and I talk about myself like this. Most of the fish I've caught has been on terminal tackle, plain hook and sinker with live bait. Now I wonder what lure I'm going to use You ever ask your self when you leave the boat launch and drive to the other side of the lake maybe 10 miles, and at the end of the day you get back to the launch and a kid is fishing on the dock with a big stringer of fish that's bigger and better than you caught. Don't you just love it. One of my old fishin buddys used to tell me, he did care how many more fish I caught than him. He just wanted the biggest because when we got back to the dock and people would only ask who caught the BIG ONE Good thread Garry"
533831,MJL,2011-01-02 15:39:00,2427,"I do agree with what you said Garry.  I will play a little devil’s advocate just for fun  Over the last while, I’ve been given some new perspective on how precious and scarce time on the water can be.  I dropped from fishing 4-6 days a week to only 1 day a week now if I’m lucky – Mainly because of work and having to visit the doctors and hospitals the other times I’m free.  Back in high-school I dated a girl who had a Japanese father who happened to love fishing as much as I did (and was the ultimate gear junky).  The words of advice that he gave me when I asked about all of his tackle were this:  “If you only could get out a few times a year (like he did), wouldn’t you want to make that day as special as it can be?  Wouldn’t you want the best tackle on that special day so you can enjoy yourself the most?”  While I don’t know in what context he used the term ‘best’, we could assume that it could refer to some things like: being light, durable, smooth, fast (or slow depending on your preference), comfortable or custom built to your preferences. Or it could mean designed species specific to give you the ‘best’ chance of catching them with a given a technique. In terms of lure quantity (or quality), wouldn't you want to have that 'special' lure in the event that none other in your tackle box are working?  That’s pretty much the mentality of the Japanese culture and I can’t argue with that.  I'm told that there are more high end fly rods and reels per capita in Japan than anywhere else in the world.  Me personally, I just got an overpriced St Croix Legend Ultra UL ice rod (because it had the 24k gold plated spring indicator thingy built in), a new Hummindbird ice transducer (because carrying around a wooden stick + clamp was a pain), a new survival suit to keep warm and tomorrow I hope to pick up an underwater camera to make my days on the water extra special   ...At least that’s what I told my mom when she asked about the new sled with all the stuff inside.  She just rolls her eyes at me now"

533839,bigugli,2011-01-02 16:05:00,6138,"Had a co-worker like that. 20 different mail order catalogues in his desk. More tackle than he could ever use. Took him 20 minutes to load his gear in the boat. Took 5 casts with a bait; no fish, change lure. He was so busy retying after blowing through the first 6-7 pretied rigs. All the while i'm working what I've got, catching fish, and pissing him off. All the gear in the world will not make you a good angler."

Reels have almost become too light and rods tend to feel tip heavy! In fact, I mounted a Core 50 on an ice fishing rod. The balance was exquisite but do I really need a $400 ice combo? (I bet Terry is trying his Calais DC on a ice rod as I type  )   And how much do you want for your HDS unit?    Great thread 2r's. It's all true but I suspect many of us will continue to enjoy the enhancments in gear.  Not to center out Lew but he's someone many of us know.

English translation: the same reel we made 15 years ago, but now it's orange and silver, and the same rod we sold in the 60s for $19 but now it's $200 and has a handle made up of old bicycle grips. Line up!!"
