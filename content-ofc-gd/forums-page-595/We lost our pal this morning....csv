532643,aplumma,2010-12-29 19:14:00,6896,Jackie I am so sorry to hear that Jack has passed. I am grateful that he had Christmas with his family and loved ones around him.While his body has passed on he will live in the hearts of all he has touched. I did not get as much time with him as I wanted but the time I did get is very precious to me. I have one of his carvings of a unicorn and it brings a smile to everyones face that gets to see it and the story of the man who's talent turned a piece of wood into a mythical horse. While we grieve for the loss of the ability to make more memories with Jack we also should realize that the ones we all have have become even more precious to us. May all of our prayers light the way for his Journey into the Lords hands and one day to be reunited with our friends.  Art

I'm in a similar situation right now, I lost a cousin of mine on Friday.  You may have heard it on the news.  He was alone at his cottage in Bracebridge when it went up in flames at 3am.  He battled cancer for 3 years and was finally free of it this fall.  He was happy again and to have this happen on Christmas Eve was a nightmare.  Christmas felt different this year."

532638,splashhopper,2010-12-29 19:10:00,2931,"Very sorry for the loss of your friend Beans. I lost mine this summer too.  Here is a reminder of something you and I were taught many moons ago   :  The Peace Prayer of Saint Francis  ""O Lord, make me an instrument of Thy Peace! Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is discord, harmony. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there is sorrow, joy.  Oh Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life."""
