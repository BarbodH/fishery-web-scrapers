You use your own rod on it and there is a spring around the fulcrum and your rod it was made of wood and folded down pretty easy, and you could see the slightest nudge.   I was wondering if anyone knew who this guy is that makes them or if the guy that was using them is on the board. Because I'd like to get a couple of them  I kind of drew up a picture of what it looks like.       Also which do you prefer? A Tip-up or a tip-down?  Anyone have any good ways to make a tip down.  Pictures?"
