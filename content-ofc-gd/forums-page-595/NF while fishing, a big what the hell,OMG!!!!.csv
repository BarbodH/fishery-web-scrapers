Or to anyone at all! Im sure there was a mixture involved! For Gods sake, please dont drink and drive! A taxi is your friend!"
534053,Joey,2011-01-03 01:25:00,9122,"Hmmm, trying to figure out what that is"
534057,Dondorfish,2011-01-03 01:27:00,1000,Joey - thats a car over the side on the Niagara Parkway. Saw it on the news.  Tracker (Don)

534063,ChrisK,2011-01-03 01:32:00,2772,Looks like a helicopter stuck in a tree
534067,vinnimon,2011-01-03 01:39:00,2593,"  Joey, it took us a second or two to figure it out while drifting by! there were two men hooking up the vehicle to a wench this morning! Tracker is right on the money! A true eye opener, I figured a quick flash freeze with the cold front aproaching, caused it!"

534076,Joey,2011-01-03 01:58:00,9122,"Okay, thanks for the info, I found the article and video, sheesh, they are very lucky.  I love how the article says they landed in the river, then later on say they were just short of the river  http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20110102/niagara-car-crash-110102/"
534078,skeeter,2011-01-03 02:03:00,1907,"the driver was charged with reckless endangerment causing bodily harm,& impaired."
534093,vinnimon,2011-01-03 02:24:00,2593,"  Thanks Joey, for the link!"
534192,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-03 15:02:00,655,"Here is a pic from my Kodak. I zoomed in close, but it didn't turn out that well due to low light conditions and drifting by quickly in the boat. I lightened it up some.    The car was about a little more than half way down the steep bank to the river. It's a good thing the trees stopped the car from landing in the icy cold river, or none of occupants of the car would have lived.  I spoke briefly with the accident investigator at Queenston. He informed me the car had young adults and alcohol was the suspected cause of the accident. He also said everyone wasn't in that bad of shape except for one passenger in serious condition that may not make it.  A pointless accident that could have been easily avoided for the cost of a cab."
