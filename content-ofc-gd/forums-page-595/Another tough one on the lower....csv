Got the Brown Roe all set Thurs night, lots of different sized bags & colours ready to go!...Of course it probably would have worked better if I hadn't left it in the fridge.  Well that just meant working other methods!  7 hours of: Gulp minnows couple different sizes, some trout flies (buggers etc), skinny Pink worms, few single Chinny eggs (from jar), Mepps spinners, Cleo spoons, Cast Master, Chrome Rattle-Trap, Pink/Purple jigs,...hmm think that was everything...Not even a sniff!!  Was great day to be out without a doubt, but man, was the bite ever off!  Visibilty was at least a couple of feet as well.  The whole day, saw 1 steelie caught on a pink bag, and 3 lakers caught on monster sized jigs with plastic fish bodies. It seemed everyone we talked to was switching up between minnows & roe, but no takers.  I know I was getting down to the bottom because I broke off about a dozen times with the minnows & flies.  Oh well, it was at least an awsome New Years Eve day to be out on the river!"

Nice scenery, fresh air and a little rain and drizzle to make you feel like the hardy type.  I didn't make out very well either today down in the Niagara but, like you guys, it was great to be out!"
