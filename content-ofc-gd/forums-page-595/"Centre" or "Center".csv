533392,Fishnwire,2011-01-01 00:22:00,983,"Is it ""centre"" or ""center""...the context is this:  Amongst the other electricians at the mine I work, we began refering to our underground shop as the ""action centre"" (or center) as a little joke because the phone rings off the hook down there sometimes.  I looked at online dictionaries and can't seem to determine if both are equally acceptable, or one would be better.  Is it just a Canadian vs American thing?  Thanx in advance."
533394,toca,2011-01-01 00:25:00,274,are you american or canadian?    doesnt really matter. both are correct spelling.

533419,Tdel,2011-01-01 01:18:00,393,"I am in agreement with Randy and Terry on this.  It is a British and American thing.  I believe the spelling was changed around the same time that the spelling of colour and color, neighbour and neighbor, etc were changed.  Tom."
533421,dave524,2011-01-01 01:22:00,4508,"Centre is English (ie Canadian) spelling, center is American spelling, they also have a bad habit of dropping u's like in colour and honour."
