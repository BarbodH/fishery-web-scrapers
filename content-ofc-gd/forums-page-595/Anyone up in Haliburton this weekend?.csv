533156,Jigger,2010-12-31 03:48:00,1237,Heading up New Years day and itching to hit the ice this weekend. Anyone going up the 1st or 2nd and want to hook up? I'll be just north of Minden.

533320,GBW,2010-12-31 20:12:00,8460,"when I was up on 4 mile lake for Christmas the ice was very thin.  2 whack's with the spud and it was through the ice.  took the tape to the hole, 2.5"".  any lake that is decent in size dosen't have safe ice yet (that I know of).  it was a very windy start to make ice so it wasn't forming well."
533335,Jigger,2010-12-31 21:25:00,1237,"Yeah, not holding out too much hope for the bigger lakes. A short drive any which way has access to smaller bodies that might have some more stable ice. I'll bring a long rod in any event...  Edit: We share the same waters Fishboy. I'll let you know how things go!"
