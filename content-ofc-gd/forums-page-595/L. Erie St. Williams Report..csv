Was a nice day, didn't need the heater. Having Perch for super tonight. New Years Eve Perch. Has a ring to it.      Tried my new Pack Shack, worked great but I don't know how it likes LPB wind. I don't know of a windier place in the world like LPB can get.  Walked in, in 1"" of water on top of the fast melting ice. There was 10"" of good black ice but I don't know how it's going to be for the weekend. The hut operator was taking his huts in while we walked in. Be careful guys if your thinking of going this week."

Great for the kids because you can see the bottom and the fish. I came home with a soar neck, looking down the hole. I guess that makes me a kid  Fishnsled I just finished a big plate of those little ones, nothing like a fresh feed.  Phil, Me and Glenn Did the big walk today  . I think I walked his legs off   The young Guy can't keep up with the old man  When I dropped him off at home, he went right to bed. 12 hours ice fishin did him in   You got to come out with us sometime Phil"
