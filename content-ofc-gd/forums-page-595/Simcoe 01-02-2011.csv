533998,Joey,2011-01-02 23:06:00,9122,"We met up with Terry for some Perch fishing on Simcoe today.  We were really expecting some terrible ice conditions, but they were fine.  Studs on the new sled would have been nice, but we managed and got to take her out for our first ride  Here's a few pics of the day and ice conditions.  Was pretty windy               Caught mostly dinks, but even Paul caught fish  Kept 4 for a snack!  "

534008,Jds63,2011-01-02 23:23:00,1365,"nice setup, looks like the last few days of mild weather didn't affect it too much"
534009,WeedLine,2011-01-02 23:24:00,322,Nice looking sled.
534015,Joey,2011-01-02 23:43:00,9122, That would definately work
534016,kickingfrog,2011-01-02 23:48:00,8333, Maybe you could head out before me with your new toy and drag a heavy blanket soaked with warm water???

534021,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-03 00:05:00,4399,"Ice fishing...I miss it, NOT!!!  Nice sled you have there Joey if you don`t mind me asking what does it cost to insure a fancy piece of equipment like that?"
534028,Joey,2011-01-03 00:23:00,9122," It costs about $60 a month, but of course you have to insure it for the whole year"
534029,Terry,2011-01-03 00:23:00,14456,"and it looks even nicer in person, a great machine there  I had a good time on that slippery ice   the rain from the day before got into my hut and it took a long time to thaw it out enough to get it all the way flipped down              "
534039,Joey,2011-01-03 00:37:00,9122,"We had a great time too Terry, great company as always     Looking forward to next weekend if the stars align  Jeez, I look cold"
534051,moxie,2011-01-03 01:17:00,1566,Ya. Doesn't look like the mild spell affected SimmyCoe at all. Good on you guys for getting out there and compliments on the ride. I'm chompin at the bit. CMON WHITIES!!!

534125,limeyangler,2011-01-03 04:34:00,5204,"That sled is too nice.  Is it not bad for a sled to run on bare ice like that though, i welded my track to the sliders a couple years back driving on hard pack snow/ice...or is that just sumfink that happens with older crappy sleds....like mine.  Anyway....awesome sled, awesome pics...hope supper was good...of course it was...fresh fishies....mmmmmmmmmm.  Nice one Joey."
