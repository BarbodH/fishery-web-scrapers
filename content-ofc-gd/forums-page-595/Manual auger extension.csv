I have a 8"" fin bore auger that does not fold... I was wondering if anybody knows if there are extensions for this auger and were I might find one...  Thanks to anyone that leaves me some info..."

He doesn't need an extentsion because he can get right down to the ice surface with it.   http://ca.wholesalesports.com/storefront/ice-fishing/augers-tools/nordic-electric-ice-drill-adapter/prod289020.html"

533391,mike rousseau,2011-01-01 00:21:00,4661,This is true... But like I said the shack is pretty high up... Anyways the previous posts were a great help and my extension is on it's way....
