533626,splashhopper,2011-01-01 21:49:00,2931,Great photos  Question ?  Do the running shoes grip the ice better than the felt bottom wading boots ?
533646,Victor,2011-01-01 22:49:00,1609,Great pics as usual Mark. It's gotta be the olympus   gotta go find some open water myself too ... itching for a few drifts

533692,l2p,2011-01-02 01:28:00,346,"thanks guys, the olympus is great victor. still tanking everything i put it through ahha.  and for the shoes well, i dont like wading boots cause most of them get really heavy when wet and i dont like how hard boots are on my feet. the shoes that i wear are very comfy and feel like im not even wearing them. as for the grip, i having taking any falls on them yet so i cant really say. although i did just trek down into the niagara gorge with them no prob."
