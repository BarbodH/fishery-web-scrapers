533973,Fisherman,2011-01-02 21:42:00,7201,"Just finished reading elsewhere, Cooks Bay is good, slick like pikesnot, wear cleats, you really don't loose much ice at this time of year, the sun is too low on the horizon to affect it."
533976,marth11,2011-01-02 21:51:00,60,its going to be slushy as well but that will refreeze today or tonight just need some nicer weather and I will be back at it
533990,skeeter,2011-01-02 22:44:00,1907," and you know how slick pike snot is, how??"
533991,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-02 22:47:00,2582,Just got home.Couch off Airport Rd is GLARE ICE..but we never lost any ice. 8-10 inches everywhere. No water on the top anywhere...everything has froze up tight. Someone even parked there truck on the ice. However I don't for a second recommend anybody should do that. It had some seepage under it when I was coming off..hopefully there truck doesn't go through before they come off.
533992,Terry,2011-01-02 22:47:00,14456,cooks bay at gilford has completely refroze  the crack at the ramp is not the best but the ice is good no water on top at all  hard for anyone walking without cleats or skidoos without studs but great ice
534004,kickingfrog,2011-01-02 23:16:00,8333,"Thanks guys. That is what I figured, but didn't want to waste a morning trip to have to turn around. I have a unplanned Monday off and hope I can get out for a few hours at least."
534013,kickingfrog,2011-01-02 23:34:00,8333,"Local news just showed some guys on Kempenfelt bay in a big Lund. I'm hitting the hard stuff, it's been a long time since I took the canoe out in January... and the main reason I stopped doing that was the road salt on the ash gunwales and what pain it was to clean them in the winter."
534034,Fisherman,2011-01-03 00:27:00,7201,"Well, all I can remember is 1 flip of the tail, the fish got away and I ended up with this plop of ""pikesnot""  on my face, maybe not as long lasting as grease but it let the fish escape."
