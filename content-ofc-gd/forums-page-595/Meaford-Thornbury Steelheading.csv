534139,danjang,2011-01-03 06:57:00,148,I'll be going up to Blue Mountain for a snowboard/ski trip with a few friends. I was wondering if it was possible to pier fish either the Bighead or Beaver river during this time of year. I have never been to either river. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!
