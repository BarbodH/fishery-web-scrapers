533795,lew,2011-01-02 13:36:00,12766,"When I bought the new boat in '09 I went to the licensing office to transfer the license plate from the old trailer to the new one and the clerk couldn't find any record of my plate on her computer.  She asked me where it was and I told her I'd had it for years and it was still on my old trailer. She told me to have a seat and she'd check the system further. She called me back up about 30 minutes later to tell me she'd finally located a record of my plate but it had been ""removed from the system"" 5 years earlier and was no longer valid but she had absolutely no idea why a perfectly valid license plate would be wiped out, or why I was never notified about it.  I asked her what would have happened if I'd been stopped by the police and they found out my license plate didn't really exist and she said ""I dunno, I spose you woulda been in trouble ""  I had to purchase a new plate for my trailer and was told to destroy the old plate. I asked her how I should destroy something that doesn't exist and was given another ""I dunno""  It's really sad when such seemingly simple tasks are made to seem so difficult."

534147,Chris,2011-01-03 11:26:00,405,"Hi, When I bought my new boat, I called ahead to make sure that when I went to the license bureau that I had everything. I was trading my old boat and when she asked me for the old boat's V.I.N. I read it off to her. She said that I was short one number, that there should be 17 numbers. So I call the dealer where I traded my old boat and asked them to go out in the yard and check my boat's V.I.N. They read back to me the same 16 digit number I had. I then told them my dilema and he told me that they run into this all the time and to simply add a zero at the beginning. Went back in and gave her the same number with a zero at the beginning and voila...it went thru. Go figure....  "

534169,bucont,2011-01-03 14:11:00,20,   We all got a few of these stories for sure.
534171,ChrisK,2011-01-03 14:14:00,2772,Personally I get the impression they are just under a lot of imformation overload. They basically tell you stuff that they hope will be correct if the guy next to him or her is doing there job correctly and so on.I'm sure like anywhere else key stroke errors go unnoticed in heat of the moment when theres lines of people breathing down your throat. Not trying to make excuses for them but I can only imagine how it must be dealing with the public at times...
534173,corvette1,2011-01-03 14:17:00,1765,my turn to rant crossed the border had a nice dinner at east side then off to can tire and no fishing licence's what's up with this jan 1 you need a new licence but we don't have any yet
534176,Billy Bob,2011-01-03 14:19:00,5865,Anyone got a link so this lazy American can contribute (renew fishing  license) to the black hole (that exist here and there)...  Bob
534182,lew,2011-01-03 14:37:00,12766,"I just remembered another governmemt screw-up involving a new boat purchase.  I bought a new boat in 1999 and payed cash for it including all taxes and licensing and went on my way. Two years later I got a letter from the government...can't remember which one....wanting a copy of my bill of sale to prove I'd payed all my sales tax on the boat. Not a big problem so I sent them the photocopy showing everything was payed in full.  Couple years later I got another letter from them requesting the same thing again, so I sent them yet another photocopy showing I didn't owe them anything.  Well they say things happen in three's and sure enuff, I get yet another letter from these characters wanting proof for the 3rd time that taxes were payed.  I totally ignored the final demand and never heard from them again, so perhaps I should have ignored the other letters too.  I still have my original bill of sale though just incase they decide to harrass me again for the taxes.  It really is sad."
534230,Joey,2011-01-03 16:30:00,9122,"  That's crazy Lew.  Never throw anything away is what I've learned, ever"
533393,Joey,2011-01-01 00:24:00,9122,"So buying a new snowmobile and getting ready for the 2011 ice fishing season is supposed to be a joyeous occasion, but the bureaucratic Bull I put up with today was just unbelievable.  After having a hard time getting my driver's license changed to my married name (I still haven't been able to), I wanted to make sure that since Paul bought the trailer, I could register it today before we picked up the sled so it was legal to drive.  I called the MTO 3 times yesterday to ask what my requirements were, what to bring, whether I would be able to transfer the plate from the old trailer (in my maiden name) to the new trailer (in Paul's name).  Yes, yes and yes I was told as I am now Mrs. Paul Tyborski, no problemo.  I gather the required documents and headed up first thing this morning to a line up that was out the door.  Oh well, we weren't leaving to pick up the sled til noonish and I was excited for the day so I waited patiently.  My turn came up and I was told to fill out these forms (I accidentally gave my entire registration for the old trailer to the new buyer, so had pay $10 for a new one).  So I happily filled away and then got to go to the front of the line and wait again.  My turn is up again and they do the replacement registration, then comes time to transfer plate to new trailer.  Oh, no we can't do that, your husband has to.  I politely said that I had called and was told that was not so, and 3 times they told me I could do it.  They said nope, sorry, not unless he sent a letter saying it was okay.  I asked what good was it to call the MTO and get info for if it was incorrect and they said that the people I talked to at the MTO were obviously misinformed.  After they talked to me like I was a peace of dirt idiot for a minute I lost it.  I grabbed up all my stuff and said ""This is BULL!!, fine I'll just drive it illegally then because I'm going to pick up my snowmobile today and you guys don't know your arse from hole in the ground.""  Of course everyone is staring at this point and they said no, they would not let me leave with my stuff as I had not paid the $10 to replace my registration.  I made a few more comments about their business practices and brought up the misinformation I got last time I was there trying to get my drivers licence changed to my married name without success and finally, one of them said, ""why don't you just let her get the registration in her husband's name then.""  I said if they could do that, fine.  Of course that was $35 and it is only $10 to transfer a plate.  So a new plate was registered for $35 and I still had to pay $10 for the old one as it was now replaced  So I thought that was my stress for the day, should be smooth sailing, just pick up the sled, two fishing licenses as you can't order them online yet, and we're set.  We get the sled, race back to CTC (I called first to see when they were open until today and if they had any fishing licences and they said yes).  Get to CTC and guess what, no 2011 licences!!!!!   I said ""I just called you 10 minutes ago and was told you have them.""  Paul pulled me out of the store at this point and said it was not worth it, as I guess he could see I had had enough Bull for one day.  So I guess my rant is that the Government makes it mandatory you get licences/registration for almost everything we do and make it as hard a possible to get them.   Okay, I feel better already, whew!!!!!  END RANT!"
533402,Terry,2011-01-01 00:32:00,14456,you just described the story of my life   crap like that happens to me all the time           welcome to my world now lets go fishing..LOL

533416,bigugli,2011-01-01 01:07:00,6138,You did everything you were supposed to Joey. You just made one wee mistake. You relied on our government to do things right or do the right thing.
533430,kickingfrog,2011-01-01 01:47:00,8333, When did you stop using your maiden name?
533432,TennesseeGuy,2011-01-01 02:07:00,957,Walmart would handle that type of transaction in about 12 minutes at about 1/3 the cost.

533529,Dano,2011-01-01 16:46:00,719,"Yup, typical, happens to me all the time too Joey, so take solace you are not alone. Every time I go a gov't centre (center) of some sort things go awry as sure as the sun rises no matter how much prep work investigating I have done. The worst part? You have absolutley zero recourse other than another letter to your MP that will be ignored."

Poor fellow sitting beside me waited for over an hour and a half to be told he didn't have all the necessary documents..  Same deal.  He called in and some yop forget to tell him to bring such and such.  Oh well..  At least you're good to go!  When we going fishing?!?!"

Its been in place for a few years now. Did mine dec 1st and got it last week,also had a printout reciept just in case crappy post decides to be like crappy tire.."
533574,Joey,2011-01-01 19:52:00,9122," I tried to renew online but it would not let me.  I tried yesterday afternoon and it would not work, but then tried 7 minutes after midnight last night and it let me.  Guess it was 2011 by then so it worked"
533586,bigugli,2011-01-01 20:14:00,6138," Political parties on all sides are equally useless. Gun registry has nothing to do with McGuinty, and the OLC was created by the Tories under emperor Bill back in the 70's. Bottom line is that any politician who actually tries to make the public service accountable might as well shoot himself. I've watched bureaucrats hamstring and ruin a politician's career in under 2 years. Politicians only come up with ideas. They don't have the brains to implement them. So the bureaucrats do as they please. It's not like you can vote out a pencil pusher."

I hope all is better today and you guys got out fishing.  Happy New year
533675,Billy Bob,2011-01-02 00:27:00,5865,Makes me feel much better about my government....NOT  Went through a bunch of Bull trying to get our enhanced drivers license 2 years ago....  Went to the Dept of Motor Vehicles which is only 2 miles away in Cheektowaga.....CLOSED because it was a Monday and they close Mondays but open a small satellite office 5-6 miles away at a community college (how the hell is this better)...but we call on our cell phone to make sure this satellite office offers Enhanced Drivers License...automated voice says ALL offices offer EDL's...so we head there....stand in line for our turn...SORRY satellite office DON'T do EDL's...So now we head in the opposite direction to Downtown Buffalo......grrrrr....pay for parking down there....almost against my religion....wife and I tell them we want to extend our new EDL's (pay extra) so they will be good for 8 years like they have been saying in the Buffalo News because NYS is upping the cost in May....this way we will save money....the nit wits behind the counter say we can't do this...we insist...finally a supervisor says YES you can........my wife's current driver's license is in her name (my last name) but her birth certificate is in her maiden's name.....NO PROBLEM....SECURITY my ass.....just a whole waste of time and MONEY...paid more money and now I have a Enhanced Driver's License that is NO more secure then my old driver's license.  Maybe I just should of marked my old driver's license with a magic marker the way a REAL EXPENSIVE EDL looks....
