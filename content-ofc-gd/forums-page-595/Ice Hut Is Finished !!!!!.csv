533077,Nipfisher,2010-12-31 01:47:00,2449,"How many holes in the floor? Can you keep a line in all night? We have holes in the corners and have lines fixed right to the wall. We fish all night, the bells wake us up."
533078,skeeter,2010-12-31 01:50:00,1907,"Terry there is 1 1/2""styrofoam insulation in the floor,walls & ceiling. then the Reflectix which has a Class A/Class 1 Fire Rating .  Cliff you know you have an open invitation any time.  Bare foot, i NEVER lock the hut, if you do the idiots will kick the door in to see what they can steal. and i never leave anything in the hut for them, not even garbage."
533079,splashhopper,2010-12-31 01:51:00,2931,very kewl.  What about lights that are battery operated ?
533085,skeeter,2010-12-31 01:53:00,1907,"1 hole 59""x21"" but i use the auger so i can cut up to 6 holes."
533089,skeeter,2010-12-31 01:57:00,1907,"thanks splashhopper, i forgot to mention that part. i bought an rv light from princess auto today $6.99 (2 bulb unit) and installed a 12v fan on the ceiling to blow the heat back down (5"" computer fan)."
533093,splashhopper,2010-12-31 02:00:00,2931," And if u really wanna stay warm, when u sleep there overnight, grab those plug in seat heaters for cars... put it under your sleeping bag and hook it up to the battery.... toasty warm and doesn't take up any room... and can be used double duty over those wooded seats while fishing"
533099,skeeter,2010-12-31 02:10:00,1907,"flat screen tv--lol well i do have a 5"" portable that runs on 12volt recliner--no way , i want to be awake if i get a fish on..."

533133,skeeter,2010-12-31 03:14:00,1907," you might want to wait till its out on the ice, could be a bumpy ride going out.LOL but it is only .6km away from the lake in lefroy!!!"

533144,GBW,2010-12-31 03:24:00,8460,"the ""aroma"" from Mrs Kelly's AMAZING Chili..."
533146,GBW,2010-12-31 03:26:00,8460,"Nope, the clam 2000 and the heater can tag along for a visit too."
533157,skeeter,2010-12-31 03:49:00,1907,"chili--LOL it would work but the carbon monoxide detector wouldnt shut up...  i use a propane camp stove, heats the hut and heats up the food , and of course my coffee too."
