533453,GBW,2011-01-01 03:37:00,8460,"So I decided to make some changes to my cargo bucket today, have you done the same?  Let's see those 'white bucket's', LOL! "
533454,GBW,2011-01-01 03:38:00,8460,and one with one rod in the new holders... 
533455,GBW,2011-01-01 03:41:00,8460,"Sorry about the pic's, they are from my blackberry...  Next, a 11""x14"" sheet of paper with the OFC logo on the other side...  Good luck out there in 2011 folks!  Geoff"
533469,Jds63,2011-01-01 06:01:00,1365,nice mod
533479,toca,2011-01-01 09:04:00,274,how much for the bucket?  a friend of mine stole my bucket and lost it(didnt matter really stole it from my pa).  hoping canadian tire or homedepot sells six gallon buckets
533481,outllaw,2011-01-01 12:05:00,1232,6 gallon buckets. gotta be inflation. they used to be 5 gallon pails. happy new year lol.
533485,dave524,2011-01-01 12:18:00,4508,"Get a Canadian 5 gallon bucket, it'll be 6 gallons U.S.  Happy New Year"
533486,outllaw,2011-01-01 12:36:00,1232,5 gallon buckets are priceless.  they carry everything from our treasures to fish.
533497,BUSTER,2011-01-01 14:48:00,1336,cool you getting it airbrushed?
533498,ketchenany,2011-01-01 14:53:00,3229,  I just gave 20 away!  :wallbash:  :wallbash:
533499,BUSTER,2011-01-01 15:04:00,1336,  you could BUY an OFC sticker from the web site and get a few jumala spinners while your at it! http://www.ofnstore.com/
533500,aplumma,2011-01-01 15:05:00,6896,In some circles the 5 gallon bucket is a legal form of measurement. Most everyone if told I got a 5 gallon bucket of perch can usually guess within 10 fish how many you caught....  Art
533549,skeeter,2011-01-01 18:19:00,1907,Rod holders on the outside of the bucket. thats like tying lumber to the roof of a pick up truck.
533551,GBW,2011-01-01 18:22:00,8460,It's because all the fish on the inside at the end of the day will keep it balanced.  On my way on the ice my tackle bag and tip-up sit inside it.
533552,skeeter,2011-01-01 18:26:00,1907, where's the auger go?
533554,toca,2011-01-01 18:28:00,274,i bought that little apron thing at bass pro for the bucket that holds not only rods but other pockets for utilities and extra tackle and stuff.  seemed like an interesting concept. the only problem was i found out somebody stole my bucket
533555,GBW,2011-01-01 18:52:00,8460,in my new sled    or on top of my clam 2000
533557,GBW,2011-01-01 18:53:00,8460,"you ever in Markham?  If so, PM me and I will tell you a place that has a bunch out back from time to time, free..."
533583,sirfish,2011-01-01 20:09:00,175,"Buckets can be had at most restaurants or wine making shops...free for the asking. Get 2 ,cut one off about 3""inches below the last ring and slip it into the first bucket and rivet it there, you will love the extra height   also adds extra storage you will find your Vex and minnow bucket will slide right in. Get one of the BPS blue wrap around pouches,but first get a strip of 1"" thick stick on velcro and put it around the outside of the bucket and co-inside on the backside of the pouch as the pouch elastic strap stretches and it will fall off the bucket if you don't. Then get one of the frabill padded lids or use the bucket lid and make a pad for it..definately more comfortable and convienient."
533668,toca,2011-01-02 00:04:00,274, most definately will gbw. dont feel like paying 10 bucks for a stupid bucket.    i got all that except a bucket.  and you are absolutely right. like the idea but what a stupid design flaw. that should have gone to the bottom and a more solid one on the top.
533672,outllaw,2011-01-02 00:18:00,1232,i have to say this. its on my bucket list
533679,drwxr,2011-01-02 00:56:00,453,$7 in CT    
533683,skeeter,2011-01-02 01:02:00,1907,"$7 at ct?? i will give you $10 for it, including the fish!!!!!!!"
533717,irishfield,2011-01-02 02:39:00,26272,"I have one of those bucket ""skirts"" and a bucket seat if anyone is in need..."
