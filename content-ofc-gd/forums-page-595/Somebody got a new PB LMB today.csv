533096,Cudz,2010-12-31 02:04:00,2652,"ummm, well, just take my word,  6 +  maybe 7 +   I did not have a scale."
533097,misfish,2010-12-31 02:07:00,29133,"  Ok where the hell are ya at Chris?it aint Simcoe,we know that."
533101,Cudz,2010-12-31 02:14:00,2652,"nope. And I caught it on the most obscure bait.  The fish was def 7+ and you all have to guess what it was caught on.  One more thing that I noticed about the largies here is that they have quite sharp teeth!  Lippin them was trickier than I thought it would be.  I got bad sandpaper thumb after 2 bass.  It was the third biggest bass I saw this week.  One went over 11, another 8 and mine.  And here is the kicker.  Caught it from shore."
533103,misfish,2010-12-31 02:19:00,29133,Ok lets start with Mexico?

533169,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-12-31 04:19:00,1107,Nice 7+ will be hard to beat in Ontario
533170,Cudz,2010-12-31 04:31:00,2652,"I should not be throwing out numbers like 7+.  The fish was very long but not fat like fall smallies.  It was a bit lean.  Def 6+ lol.  It did however have a mouth of a 7+ pound fish.  Caught on,   wait for it.      A hot dog wiener  There is a story behind the wiener but I have to go to bed now.  Will let you know about it Saturday."

533232,kickingfrog,2010-12-31 14:46:00,8333, Sounds like something a seven year old girl might use as bait.  Anxious for the photos.
