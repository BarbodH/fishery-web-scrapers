Drilled a couple of holes in about 7 ft of water and caught 3 small perch in 1 hour. Ice was about 8 - 9 inches thick and had lots of water on top which made the trek a little tricky.  Skidooers were flying across the lake so i guess it must be ok. After tomorrow night I am sure it will be like a sheet of glass when it freezes."

533348,bigugli,2010-12-31 22:18:00,6138,Skidoos at speed can fly across thin ice and open water. The ice still won't bear the weight of a person when thin or really soft.
