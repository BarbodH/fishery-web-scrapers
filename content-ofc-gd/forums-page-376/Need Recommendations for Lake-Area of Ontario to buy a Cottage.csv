722753,manjo39,2012-08-15 17:58:00,354," Yes, I thought the same thing.  I'll have to look into maintaining a pool (work effort and ongoing cost).  Anyone have any experience with pool maintenance they would like to share?"
722755,manjo39,2012-08-15 18:05:00,354, Would you mind sharing your experience with the pool.  How much effort is it to maintain (I have to consider I am only up there on weekends and vacations). Ongoing costs?
722783,jimmer,2012-08-15 19:24:00,2730,"We have a 12' x 24' above ground pool. We have the pump/filter on a timer that will run about 4 hours a day on the off peak hydro times. We don't bother with a heater, but there are a variety of options. Add Chlorine once a week, along with pucks and that's it. Once in a while we have to add some pool clear if it starts getting cloudy. It can be vacuumed once a week, which takes about 15 minutes. Drain pool down in the fall leaving 18"" of water and put winter cover on it. Fill in spring with lake water and shock it to clear it up, add chlorine and it's ready to go in a day or two. Of course there might be the odd issue or repair over the years, but that goes with anything including a new cottage (to you) that is worth over $700,000. Pools are like anything else, once you get to know it, it is fairly easy to maintain. You can always have a neighbour help out with exchange for use when you're not there."
722787,Pikeslayer,2012-08-15 19:37:00,1443," Not being an  here, but where do you drain the water from the pool?? My friend on Sturgeon is strictly septic so a pool is not ideal for his family."
722794,davew3,2012-08-15 20:04:00,430,"For another 1/2 hour to hour, north-northeast of where you are there is Jack Lake by Apsly, Paudash Lake by Bancroft,  Chandos Lake, Wollaston Lake.  Try to find a lake in a zone that allows ice fishing so you can get year round use out if it. Or east of Peterborough is Oak Lake, Belmont Lake, or Cordova Lake.  All of these lakes have great fishing and lots to do in the areas.  Good luck."
722927,bigbuck,2012-08-16 14:27:00,2449,"To the fellow that mentioned Lake Rosseau, do you have any idea what cottages cost on that lake?? You need close to a million dollars to be on it in a halfway decent cottage. Teardowns are well over a half mill. It's gorgeous BUT that comes with a price. We just bought on a smaller Muskoka lake that has bucketmouths and hammerhandles but the launch into the big 3 lakes is only a few minutes away for when I want to do some serious fishing. Do your homework on the various lakes and understand you may have to compromise. What about putting down some landscaping fabric and then dumping sand on your waterfront to create a beach?? After a couple of years the sand will wash out giving you a relatively weed free swimming area. Food for thought."
722929,dave524,2012-08-16 14:53:00,4508,"My dad bought a place in Haliburton back in 68 and had it for almost 30 years, we had a nice sandy shallow bottom but a lot of places get deep real fast with rock, never a prob with weeds. Great mix of fish    Our place was on Loon, which started with bass and pickeral, but later musky and lakers were introduced. Always something different to fish for depending on the season, a canoe will get you into smaller lakes with excellent Specs, Splake and Rainbows if you do your homework. Lastly pike are absent If I could afford the asking prices they want now  I'd have a place there in a heartbeat. If I recall he got the place with 200 frontage in 68 for $8800"
722930,Broker,2012-08-16 15:00:00,482,"If you would like a heater for your pool so you can get a bit more use out of it is to pump water out of the pool, through a black hose that is wrapped up in a circle placed in sunlight then it is pumped back in the pool, then you have your own solar heater! A simple solution that wont break the bank!"
722943,Live2fish85,2012-08-16 16:42:00,1633,  I can help with pools. It really depends on what you want for a pool. Aboveground are cheaper and cheaper to fix. They don't last nearly as long and they don't hold value to much towards a house.  Inground pools are not cheap at all. They cost more to fix. They are nicer looking and more fun to swim in. They can help with house sales and add some extra money to the price.  As for maintaining they are fairly similar. Same chemicals for both just different amounts and that is it.
722945,Broker,2012-08-16 17:00:00,482,"Also adding to live2fish post, you can get a in/above ground pool , where they dig about 2 -3 feet down and have 2-3 feet above, this way your not having the expense of an inground and will last longer, thats what I own and its 20 years old and still running good."
722957,manjo39,2012-08-16 17:44:00,354," Interesting.  I will look into this as well as above ground options.  Don't think I want to go the in ground route.  Also, I'm on septic.  Where do people on septic drain the water to?"
722963,jimmer,2012-08-16 18:15:00,2730,"I usually wait until all the chlorine has evaporated and put it on the lawn. Why can't you put it into a septic system? It's just water that would filter through your weeping tiles. Now if you only have a holding tank, I can see a problem. Some places on Sturgeon are in that situation."
722971,manjo39,2012-08-16 19:21:00,354, Wouldn't the chlorine kill the bacteria (which is needed) in the septic system?
722978,bigbuck,2012-08-16 19:31:00,2449,"The chlorine in the pool water will reek havoc with the septic, not only is it a lot of water that will flood in over a short time, the chlorine will kill the beneficial bacteria in the field. You may have a wet smelly backyard for a couple of days until the water is absorbed by the ground."
722984,davey buoy,2012-08-16 19:43:00,5505," As earlier said,wait for the chlorine level to drop and water your grass.Remember with a above ground pool you only drain the water to below the skimmer. The amount of water drained is not overly huge.Best lawn in the area!!."
723276,jimmer,2012-08-17 19:35:00,2730,yup
722302,manjo39,2012-08-13 18:21:00,354,"Hi All,  currently we are fortunate enough to own a waterfront cottage on Sturgeon Lake on the south end.  The fishing is excellent (I fish for Walleye, LMB, SMB and panfish) and I am a happy camper when at the cottage.  However, the wife and kids would like to swim in weedless water.  I wouldn't mind a swim in our plus 30 days of summer either.  Our cottage has pretty thick weeds from about 6 feet from shore onward.  Good for fishing.   Our option for swimming is to drive up to the Bobcaygeon beach.  Ideally, we would like to swim off our dock.  I am only familiar with the Kawarthas.  I am looking for recommendations for other parts of Ontario (lakes or regions) that have good fishing and good swimming opportunities.   We live on Highway 400 near Bass Pro, so going north would be easy (besides the traffic).  Ideally within a 2 hour drive.  Currently takes us 1 3/4 hours to get to Sturgeon Lake, Lindsay."
722307,woodenboater,2012-08-13 18:49:00,2277,"It's kinda not ideal but have you considered getting a permit to cut down some of the weeds ? Removes *some* fish habitat but gives you clear swim space. I'd go this route before looking for another cottage, unless of course you want a change of scenery"
722315,manjo39,2012-08-13 19:16:00,354,"  I love Sturgeon lake and the area, and we have great neighbours. I also should have mentioned we also get a lot of 'prop chop'.  Weeds that are chopped up by boat propellers and float on the surface.  They accumlate on our shore out about 10 feet floating on the surface.  Its a futile battle with these weeds."
722326,Cudz,2012-08-13 19:52:00,2652,for a bigger lake I would look at something like Lake of Bays. Clear not much weed at in most areas.
722361,captpierre,2012-08-13 21:27:00,2521,"My advice would be to stay on the Trent System.  Apparently the Haliburton lakes are down several feet so far this summer and will likely fall further.  Perhaps 6-9 ft at the north end.  Muskoka -pretty but pressured and no Muskie.  As you know water levels are stable May-Oct on the Trent.  Pretty tough to beat the Trent for fishing.  Numbers/size/species.  Boating. Proximity to home.   Nuff said.  Look at the north end of Sturgeon, Pigeon.  Lower Buckhorn or Stoney.  You want a hard bottom off the dock.  Preferably deeper water.  I'm at the north end of Pigeon.  My only complaint is weekend boat traffic.  Jetskis and wakeboard boats.  Peter"
722362,smally21,2012-08-13 21:27:00,993,"i hear you about the kawartha lakes weed. i grew up on lake huron and didnt know what a weed was..i do alot of boating and fishing in the buckhorn area and its weed central.  im always looking at listings in the parry sound area. i prefer that drive over hwy11.  i spend some time in the area and i find the lakes there to have alot to offer, you can find a weedy back bay like the kawarthas, and a big deep cold area like temagami, there isnt buckets of weeds of the dock, it seems to offer all of the types of fishing/swimming i like.  when i find something it will be in that area."
722415,Rizzo,2012-08-14 01:11:00,4754,"How about up near Parry Sound? I have weed free swimming at my cottage. Sandy beach on part of the lot, deeper water to dive into other part of lot, only 9 cottages on the whole lake! Although i like Kawarthas for musky fishing, I find cottaging WAY better up that way. Shoot...we've debated selling for the last year or 2...make me an offer I can't refuse"
722444,Paudash,2012-08-14 02:47:00,273,"I like the Bancroft area, good fishing, clean water, little traffic.  Best of all the prices are not that bad for what you get.  You can still still get a decent cottage on a good lake for under 300k"
722482,Broker,2012-08-14 13:11:00,482,"What bout parry sound on Gbay? Always crystal clear water, and basically has whatever fish you want to fish for!"
722492,darsky,2012-08-14 13:42:00,586,Apsley / Chandos area.  RRRRRRRRRRRRRreal nice up there !
722494,backbay,2012-08-14 13:49:00,773,"I have a substantial bias towards Georgian Bay, because I landscape so beautiful. Have you considered a cottage on an island?"
722504,whiskywizard,2012-08-14 14:29:00,305,"G-Bay is beautiful and mostly weed-free, but it's also a bit cold for swimming until the peak of the summer.  Hard to beat the Kawarthas for all-around good fishing, warmer waters for swimming, consistent level control and access to civilization, but they are euthrophic lakes. Have you considered looking at smaller areas within the lakes you already know?  There are places on Sturgeon, Pigeon and Cameron that have few weeds, with deeper harder bottoms.  I think woodenboater is onto an idea that should be fully explored. Selling/buying/moving will cost you a lot of money. Be realistic and calculate how much that might  be. Now look at the various things you could do to seriously improve your waterfront using that money. I have a buddy on a small eutrophic lake. He bought a couple of big rolls of heavy landscaper fabric and rolled them out on the bottom before he put his dock in. His dock area is completely weed-free, now in his 3rd season. He thinks he might have to re-do it not next summer, but the year after. Cheap and environmentally benign."
722505,manjo39,2012-08-14 14:31:00,354, I haven't considered a cottage on an island.  My first thoughts are difficult to commute back and forth on and off.
722506,manjo39,2012-08-14 14:33:00,354, Thanks for the suggestion about calculating moving costs.  I will look into it.
722512,backbay,2012-08-14 14:43:00,773," That's normal. You'll find that you simply organize for the trip over, and the boat ride is a real separation between city mindset and cottage mindset. For certain, it's not for everyone, but people who like it, really like it. In terms of the water temps, I think the coldest water I've ever swum in was up in Tobermory, if memory serves. However, in the Archipelago, south of Parry Sound, you'll find the water warmer than the Muskoka Lakes or Lake of Bays. I've never understood why, because there is deep water everywhere. Temperatures depend on where you are on the Bay..."
722518,whiskywizard,2012-08-14 15:25:00,305," Agreed.  We did the island cottage thing for quite a few years. On Gloucester Pool. I loved the island separation, my wife not so much. There were some real pros and cons to it and they usually balanced out.  Like, people couldn't just drop in unexpectedly but it took Hydro One a coon's age to get there when a tree came down on your power line."
722525,Matty,2012-08-14 16:00:00,19,"I am on a smaller lake in the Kawarthas and love it.  However, I have considered moving onto the Trent.  From the research I have done, Cameron would be my first choice for 2 reasons.  Location and size.  I dont want to be on a large body of water like Balsam, but I love the idea of being sandwiched between a couple nice size bodies of water.  There are some great sandy areas on the lake and you are surrounded by good fishing. Just my 2 cents"
722664,camillj,2012-08-15 01:52:00,1988,"Lake Rosseau ... Giant Lakers, Trophy Pickerel, Monster Musky, Pike, Bass ... and access to some of the prettiest (about 300 miles) of shoreline in Ontario (IMHO)"
722669,captpierre,2012-08-15 02:08:00,2521,Didn't know there are muskies in Rosseau?
722712,manjo39,2012-08-15 13:50:00,354,"  Without getting into the detailed calculations, I estimated that it would cost about $15,000-$20,000 to sell, move, buy.  (commission, lawyer, land tranfer tax, moving expenses etc) Wow!"
722724,woodenboater,2012-08-15 15:03:00,2277,That's a new boat right there
722726,ssminnow,2012-08-15 15:16:00,48, Don't forget the capital gains tax if it has gone up in value.  Just thought I would mention because it wasn't listed.  I have had several clients recently who have not factored this in.
722747,rob v,2012-08-15 17:25:00,535,take the money it would cost you to move and put in a pool !!
722749,crappieperchhunter,2012-08-15 17:37:00,2582, Would never have thought of that..but given the OP's circumstances I think that is a brilliant idea.
722750,jimmer,2012-08-15 17:39:00,2730,"Have you priced cottages going north from where you live? I was just up at a beautiful lake, east of Parry Sound. There were a couple of cottages for sale and both were over $700,000. Yikes! I live on Pigeon with your same predicament and have considered moving, but the prices are just crazy. I chose the pool route. Water levels have also been mentioned here, which  you should be aware of in the Haliburton area. The larger lakes in the Bancroft area are beautiful, but the walleye fishing lacks. Great bass fishing though and some decent pike fishing. There are other smaller bodies of water that offer some walleye action though. Never an easy decision!"
