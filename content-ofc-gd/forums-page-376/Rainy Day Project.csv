So today, i took some measurements, made a quick materials list and headed out find what i needed.It was meant to be.Got to the lumber store, and they had 1 piece of 3/4 inch plywood 48 x 24 inches left in stock Went to the marine store and they had 1 seat post socket, and just enough Princecraft carpet left to do the job. Talk about my lucky day Here is the result. It is solidly installed, but easily removed if i want to reconfigure the seating. Took 3 hours from start to finish.     Thanks for looking"

722374,mike rousseau,2012-08-13 22:45:00,4661,Nice facelift for the water wheels Paul....  That'll come in real handy...  I've considered doing a similar set up to extend the front casting deck...
722465,UglyBug,2012-08-14 11:09:00,148,"Buy a real boat Paul and they already have the deck build for you... Nice work, another family talent. Rememebr dad use to say you want something done right do it yourself, followed by a getter done!    "

722686,Toad Hunter,2012-08-15 06:12:00,261,"Looks good, plan on doing the same sort of thing for my tinny (only mount the deck in the front) in the late fall when I take the ol girl out for the winter. I also plan to hinge it somehow for PFD storage etc. Always nice to see people with as crazy thoughts as myself"
722688,Handlebarz,2012-08-15 09:00:00,3790,Great job paul im sure it will be put to good use
722691,mercman,2012-08-15 11:11:00,7054," Its mounted for now, but i am already planning on hingeing mine too. Just waiting for that ""EURIKA"" moment, when i know exactly how i want to do it."
