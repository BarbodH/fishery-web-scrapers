Kept us busy at the police dock station. The Little ones didn't care what they caught.                                                             And a few big kids helping out.                  "

722532,Mike Pike,2012-08-14 16:30:00,1332,That looks like a great event!  Lots of paticipation and some happy kids.  Doesn't even look like the weather could dampen the spirits!  Nice work by all the 'big kids' who volunteered.
