721924,captpierre,2012-08-11 22:35:00,2521,"Since the weather sucks, what better way to spend a Saturday than at my neighbourhood tackle shop.  Busy in there today.  I've posted before about frustration with 30lb Powerpro coming off my Sahara spinning rod in large knots casting/jerking crankbaits.  Bought 15lb Powerpro Super 8 Slick to try.( couple bucks more)  The salesrep said it is a significant improvement.  He also recommended Fireline Crystal for the same purpose.  Said because it's hard to see, a fluorocarbon leader is not necessary.  Anybody try these?  I'll post results later in the season  thanks, Peter"
721928,Gregoire,2012-08-11 22:57:00,1397,I have 80# super slick on one of my musky reels and I prefer 832 and the otiginal power pro over it.
721930,kickingfrog,2012-08-11 23:04:00,8333,"I like the crystal (14lb on a 2500), haven't tried the super slick."
721934,musky_hunter,2012-08-11 23:19:00,328,I currently use 832 but the best braid is fx2.
722042,captpierre,2012-08-12 13:05:00,2521,Good to know.  I'll see how it is with topwater.  I think stretch is a good thing when those smallies get airborn and shake their heads.  Might keep a spool loaded with Trilene handy
722050,davey buoy,2012-08-12 13:26:00,5505,Never used crystal but the last 3 years or so I've used power pro 8/30. I wish I could find the 8/30 Gorilla green braid as it's about 5 years old and never tangles and always smooth. IMO works far better than PP.
722060,Dan668,2012-08-12 13:54:00,1120,20lb daiwa samurai for me. My brother has super slick. Nice line also
722062,Rich,2012-08-12 14:01:00,3927,"I find all power pro awful. I use spiderwire stealth as recommended by a local guide, and have for 5 years now. Never had a problem with it like other braids."
722101,GBW,2012-08-12 18:46:00,8460,2 or 3x
722103,GBW,2012-08-12 18:47:00,8460,If you want Dave I can look around whitby CTC's and see as they sold it b4
722112,davey buoy,2012-08-12 19:32:00,5505," Thanks Geoff, I really don't need it now,was just wondering if they still make it or sell it. I'm not opposed to trying something if recommended by other members is readily available and is better. I'll be out at Web Offset this week. Not far from you. If you do see it next time your there by all means let me know.Thanks."
722123,GBW,2012-08-12 20:27:00,8460,"No prob Dave.  I can look and see mid week.  As for spiderwire stealth, I have used it for many years and never a problem.  Heck, I think I prase it more than the sponsored anglers do, LOL!"
722208,GBW,2012-08-13 03:37:00,8460,you want to go?  HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAH
722255,BillM,2012-08-13 14:13:00,17367,"Mono leader is a must for topwater, I hate when flouro/steel/whatever sinks and fouls up the front hook."
722256,JorgeCarlos,2012-08-13 14:16:00,109,i use 832  and super 8 PP great stuff
722628,Rich,2012-08-14 23:49:00,3927," I have 33 fishing rods, lol. Lots of ""spares"" to tinker with. And yes, i tried the super 8 and the suffix superbraid (forget the name now) this spring. Both were alright, but the PP still didnt deal well with cold or rain. The Sufix was sufficient but frayed a little too easily for my liking. I still love my stealth best. It might just be a confidence thing, i dunno."
722634,GBW,2012-08-15 00:03:00,8460,"Rich, try the Tuff Line Duracast if you like the Spiderwire Stealth.  Both are great and I'm a steath lover."
