722161,MCTFisher9120,2012-08-13 00:00:00,3761," It's a combo of 3 different small lakes all connected and the channels between them. Eastern Ontario around and past Kingston is the place to fish, after fishing these lakes I would rather a few nice trips over a dozen weekend trips close to home  Going back for 3 days in September, never fished that time of year there, Frog's might not come out who knows. Excited to try!"
722163,woodenboater,2012-08-13 00:15:00,2277,"Nice collection of bass you guys got into ! and that is def some interesting water by the rock, very thick soup.  gotta ask, that's a great screen shelter you've got set up, who makes it ? I'm looking for something to stifle next year's batch of deer flies"
