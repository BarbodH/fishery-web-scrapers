722728,woodenboater,2012-08-15 15:29:00,2277,"WOW ! That coulda gone in so many ways but I guess when you race the Peak, you have to factor in this scenario and prepare for it as these guys obviously did. Unbelieveable.  Check this other video out. While not as spectacular, I find it much scarier, probably because of the pov angle. It's been talked about on flight forums and some think they were overweight hence the slow climb as well as altitude density because of elevation.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDu0jYiz-v8&feature=player_embedded  and the same video with a voice over description of what may have happened and why.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVM3RRd1vf0&feature=em-subs_digest"

722781,NAW,2012-08-15 19:19:00,4022,Good chance it was the co-pilot's fault.  Told  him to be in 3rd gear instead of 2nd.    I didn't see a Pomeranian fly out the window during the tumble
