722168,Broker,2012-08-13 00:44:00,482,"wondering the same, downloaded it awhile ago, never really came in use for me"
722182,Default User,2012-08-13 02:00:00,72,"Just DLed it on my iPhone. Not sure how people are truly sincere about sharing their ""hotspots"" though"
722194,Broker,2012-08-13 02:44:00,482,"Yeah, who knows if people just mark random spots to mess with people like c'mon, who's gunna actually let the world wide web know their hotspot"
722197,skdds,2012-08-13 03:06:00,195," thats' what I was wondering too, although there are many maps that show areas on the lake that you may find certain species.. ..you can also use it to privately mark your own spots for future reference on the google lake map.."
722199,BillM,2012-08-13 03:09:00,17367,"Too many heros in this world not to brag about catching fish on a certain lake, lol.   Or people wanna think their guides or something, who knows."

722393,kickingfrog,2012-08-14 00:04:00,8333,The navionics app is the best thing on my phone.
