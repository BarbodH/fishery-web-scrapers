722038,fisher,2012-08-12 12:54:00,451,I am getting the wire from the control arm (the shifter) to the motor replaced by a marine mechanic.   Approximately What would it cost me parts and labour?  40 horsepower mercury and it is an 11 foot wire. Thanks
722048,jedimaster,2012-08-12 13:24:00,3472, Is this the full wiring harness or just a single wire?
722064,SBCregal,2012-08-12 14:20:00,688,"if its the throttle control, i'd imagine its a cable and not a wire?  didnt you get an estimate from the shop before you ok'd the work?  i think an hr or two in labour plus whatever the part costs is somewhat reasonable."
722067,jedimaster,2012-08-12 14:45:00,3472,"Same, a couple hours labour maybe 200 or so for that. For parts if its the control cables maybe 100-200."
722717,fisher,2012-08-15 14:18:00,451,I was stuck and had a marine mechanic come by the cottage we were staying at for the week and he end up putting in a new cable for $200 all-in. Very reasonable especially since it was a Sunday and his day off and I didn't even have to bring it in.  Thanks for the replies.
722734,mercman,2012-08-15 16:01:00,7054,  WOW !!! Thats what i call great service!!!
722742,jedimaster,2012-08-15 17:01:00,3472,Yup great service and price if you ask me.  I would pay it and offer him a beer.
722769,Pikeslayer,2012-08-15 18:35:00,1443," Good marine mechanics are hard to find in cottage country. You should post his contact info if he is agreeable. Referrals are a good way to acknowledge good work. On that note, if anybody is in need of a quality marine mechanic in Seguin/Parry Sound area, I would recommend this guy: Andy @ 705-773-2841  Slayer"
722814,GBW,2012-08-15 21:43:00,8460,"Yeah, for someone to do that; the credit should be given to him for all to see."
722835,wormdunker,2012-08-15 23:37:00,1711,You gave him a large tip right!!
