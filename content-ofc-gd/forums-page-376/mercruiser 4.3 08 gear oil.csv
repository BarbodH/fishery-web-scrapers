722254,BillM,2012-08-13 14:12:00,17367,Is the gear oil in the bilge?  Hose on the reservoir is most likely leaking.
722257,JorgeCarlos,2012-08-13 14:19:00,109,"i havent chek the bilge but i will now, the bottom of the boat is clean, nothing is leaking there.  thanks BillM"
722389,FishAbout,2012-08-13 23:58:00,106,May have a bad seal where the water impeller is in the drive.  May only be leaking when using the boat.
722467,bigbuck,2012-08-14 11:28:00,2449,"Have the drive pressure tested. You are losing it somewhere. Also, check the gear oil in the drive for water intrusion. Iboats.com forums are a great resource. Youu can get the service manual for your engine/drive there."
