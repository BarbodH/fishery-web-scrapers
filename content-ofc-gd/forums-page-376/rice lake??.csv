720486,bigzinc10,2012-08-06 01:53:00,38,I was thinking of checking out rice lake some time this summer.  I dont have a boat or anything.  Are there places to fish off shore there or rent boats?  Also what types of lures would be most successful for targeting bass here? If anyone has any info please advise.  Thx.

720610,bigbuck,2012-08-06 18:46:00,2449,Tons of fish in that lake. Bewdley and Gores Landing would be your best bets for boat rentals. You can fish off the Bewdley dock if you don't mind a crowd.

722672,bigzinc10,2012-08-15 02:53:00,38,  what do you think is avg cost for boat rental for like 5-6 hrs??

722701,tbayboy,2012-08-15 12:48:00,1497,Generally your looking at about $100 a day + gas.  Most wont do an hourly rental (though they may have a half day rate).  I've rented from Harrison's boat works many times and they've been great but I'm sure there's other good ones as well.
722702,GBW,2012-08-15 12:52:00,8460,this weekend isn't going to be a good idea for you to go as there is a tourny there on Sat. launching from harris boat works.

722714,tbayboy,2012-08-15 14:04:00,1497,Whoops - thats what I get for typing before I've finished my morning coffee - thanks for the correction
