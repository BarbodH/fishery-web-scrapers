720838,rhymobot,2012-08-07 20:11:00,174,"So I've always wondered about 2 things.  1. Why are there stocked trout ponds that you pay to fish and pay by the pound but no ponds for other species?  2. Every time I drive through Caledon, King City, and Simcoe County I see lots of ponds on people's property or a nice big one shared by like 3 houses. Have you ever heard of the property owner taking payment to allow someone to come fish the pond that is presumably stocked with bass? I'm sure some of you guys know someone with this kind of bass pond and have fished it for free.  How do you even know if it's private or not for say a small lake like this one in Caledon:  Click Here for Map  On the west side of the lake it looks like there's road/path to drive up but you can't tell if there's a private property sign there from google maps. But let's say there is no sign there then is it fair game? Because I've passed by some small ponds on what looks to be someone's property but the pond is literally only feet from the road and there's room to pull over to the side and park."
720840,jedimaster,2012-08-07 20:16:00,3472,"I  dunno, but I have often wondered if a bass caught in a private pond would count as a record. I caught a 9.5 pound largie abuot 5 years ago on a private land locked pond."
720841,Christopheraaron,2012-08-07 20:16:00,3525,"Don't bother with that pond, it's been dead for years."
720844,Rod Caster,2012-08-07 20:31:00,5784,"If there is a city or MTO maintained road nearby then there may or may not be a ""right-of-way"" which is public land, which would possibly give you land access to the pond. However, the pond itself may be private property if, let's say, the owner created the pond by flooding his own land. I'm not 100 percent sure about water ownership rules though."
720848,craigdritchie,2012-08-07 20:45:00,1586,"No sign does NOT mean it's fair game. Put it this way. Your front lawn is located only a few feet from a road. There's probably room to pull over and park. There's no sign on the lawn saying no trespassing. So does that mean I can pitch a tent, make a bonfire and camp there over the weekend?  Probably not.  If in doubt, go to the closest house some sunny afternoon and politely ask. You have nothing to lose. If they say no, then no biggie - they would have kicked you out anyway, or possibly called a cop to charge you with trespass.  If they say yes, and if you behave like a star and treat the property and property owners with respect, you'll have a great spot to fish till the end of time - and you'll likely have it all to yourself."
720862,Rod Caster,2012-08-07 21:59:00,5784,"Right of ways can be fairly large depending on the situation... Utilities, lake shore allowances, size of road shoulder etc etc. Definitly check with the city and or property owners if your uncertain."
720865,Locnar,2012-08-07 22:05:00,645,"I have a very similar question, except about Chalk Lake. It is stocked with Rainbows by the MNR, but it seems the entire shoreline is privately owned. How come the taxpayers money go to this lake, yet we aren't allowed to go fish it?  I don't know of any ponds or about that lake you posted about, sorry."
720879,Ralph Field,2012-08-07 22:56:00,1018,Some times Trout Farms have ponds stocked with bass. Komoka trout farm near London has a catch & release bass pond that you can pay to fish with single barb less hooks. I believe that there is another located close to Sparta.
720888,GBW,2012-08-07 23:39:00,8460,"Maybe the folks there have paid to do so out of pocket?  I'm close to that lake and have asked many people to let me fish it with a solid ""NO"" coming back.  I even said from a canoe due to the no gas boats at all, still a NO."
720890,Locnar,2012-08-07 23:46:00,645,"That is a possibility. It's a shame, such a beauty of a lake... I want to fish it so bad..."
722636,GreenCanada,2012-08-15 00:04:00,375,I have a few ponds in my area that I fish fairly often. I typically stop fishing when I get tired of taking the fish off my lure. Fish a minute.  I grew up in Caledon.
722637,GreenCanada,2012-08-15 00:07:00,375,"The link you posted is for Palgrave Pond, which is basically a damed section of the Humber River. I have fished it before, but not with much success. To my knowledge it is public land and there is a few clearing from which you can cast."
722744,SylvanOwner,2012-08-15 17:08:00,266,"If you're unsure of property boundaries you can always go to the local municipal tax assessment office and view the parcel boundaries as well as the owner name for a given parcel(s).  Some municipalities even have the parcel fabric on-line nowadays that you can view using a map application from their website although they don't post the owner names.  Simcoe County comes to mind.  Good luck and when in doubt you must assume you don't have permission.  ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"".......see Craig's response above"
722761,JoshS,2012-08-15 18:17:00,729," The rainbows never held there, think they were last stocked in 1959. There is however a dying population of walleye from old stocking efforts and a million little largemouth. The lake is full of largemouth .5 -1.5 lbs. Very few big fish mixed in.  Regarding access to the lake.. property owners are very strict and there is no public access unless you know someone. Not sure where the money comes.. I know there is a Chalk Lake Cottagers Association."
722808,Locnar,2012-08-15 21:04:00,645," Interesting to hear. Maybe given enough time the bass will grow to a decent size. But having the entire shoreline be private property is still lame. Seems like it would be a nice lake even for a day trip and to canoe around on. Seeing as it's a natural lake and not man-made, I don't know why they wouldn't put a little public access point. But hey, what can I do about it."
