From google maps it looks pretty murky. Looks possibly like a catfish/carp pool, but I could be wrong. Any info would be much appreciated. Thanks"

722513,Locnar,2012-08-14 14:48:00,645,"Hmmm, right on. I suppose I shall try my luck at carping again. I've tried so many times, with nothing to show for it. I've seen like 15 of them swimming around my bait, but no takes. I've tried corn, worms, hair rigs and boilies, prebaiting with method... I just don't get it. Those picky my mom hates me."
