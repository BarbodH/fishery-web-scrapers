722536,Locnar,2012-08-14 16:40:00,645,"A few years ago while I was tree planting up around the Hearst region... There was four of us, walking an old bush road to get to our pieces (land that needs planting). Initially, we were supposed to have a drive to this washout that was far too deep for the truck to pass... but we had walked past the washout before any sign of any truck. Just about 5 minutes walk from the washout, we spotted a moose... about 10 yards away. At first we thought ""darn' cool man!"", then it started grunting and splashing, since both sides of the road was standing, stagnant water. As she was splashing and grunting, a little calf splashed out from the bullrushes and stood beside its mother. At this point, I looked over at my buddies and said ""Let's get back to the washout..."". As were walking away, I kept peering back over my shoulder at the moose and it continued to stand there staring at us. Just as we got to the washout, the truck shows up... What a lazy bugger that guy was. The guy was the camp boss, and decided to get a picture of us and moose... which worked out great because the moose started to run across the road and was captured in between us (in the distance of course). Sadly, the bastardly camp boss never gave us a copy of that picture..."
722539,mpt,2012-08-14 16:48:00,158,"Fishing with a buddy in the Keewenaw Peninsula in MI's Upper Peninsula and suddenly we both saw 2 fighter jets flying just over the tops of the trees. They flew down to lake level and then up over the trees on the other side of the lake. Then we heard the sonic booms. This was 35+ years ago, no cell phones and no radio. We were sure it was the end of the world and hustled back home. Never heard a word about it just some military exercise."
722546,Out4Trout,2012-08-14 17:27:00,98,"September 2009, pre-season scouting for deer. We spotted a deer in a meadow, in tall grass, upwind from our position. My son and I crept along, every time the deer raised it's head, we would freeze. Eventually we positioned behind a tree clump and were able to walk closer. Finally, peering out from the trees, we were about 30 yds from a beautiful 8pt buck. We crept around the tree clump, and eventually were 15yds from the deer. The next time it raised it's head, it spotted us. We slowly sunk to our knees in the tall grass, and the buck snorted, then stomped it's front feet, and... headed straight toward us!! We slunk lower in the grass, and eventually it was about 5ft from us, still stomping, but standing still. We could count the whiskers around it's nose and hear it breathing. I was wondering what it's next move would be, and actually I was getting a bit worried that it might stomp us, so I stood up and yelled... HELLO!! It took off running, but only ran about 40 yds, then stood broadside to us, staring.  Then 2010, also September, checking the trail camera, while on the ATV, I noticed a young button buck under an oak tree. The oak tree was about 4ft diameter. I stopped the ATV but left it running to mask any noise I might make, with the tree between the ATV and the buck. I got off the ATV and walked slowly to the tree. Didn't hear it run, so I knew it was on the other side of the trunk. I slowly positioned around the trunk and was 3 ft from the button buck eating acorns. Suddenly, it got curious, and started walking around the tree. I circled and positioned on the opposite side of the trunk. And there it came, oblivious to me, and walked literally 3 feet from me, all the while staring at the ATV. It's tail was straight in the air, it was slowly high stepping toward the ATV. As it's tail passed by me, I reached out in an attempt to grab a handful of bucktail hair, but I couldn't quite reach it. Finally it winded my and took off flagging.  Both were awesome experiences. I doubt if either deer survived the hunt! We never saw either deer again."

721750,Fang,2012-08-11 03:11:00,1330,"All of mine seem to be Temagami bound  I've had the pleasure of seeing Northern lights more than a few times while up in Temagami. I hope and pray that there will be many dozens more for me. One time in particular was driving back from New Liskeard, in September after wings and a movie. Northern lights were absolutely out of this world and by luck I was driving. I almost put us in the ditch several times on that trip.  Second one that stands out is fishing with my son up in the Kokoko Bay arm. He was about 10 and was on the back deck talking about how it has been a long time (maybe a month or so from last trip)since he has seen any wild animals. As if on cue out of the movies we round the next point with me on the trolling motor and come face to face with a big bull moose standing knee deep in the water. I turned to him and said ""What, like that one?""  We sat and drifted a little closer and watched this moose for over 15 minutes. We got so close that we could see the hundreds of flies buzzing around his head as his antlers were still in velvet. My son was getting a little nervous and we drifted into about 20 yards away but I knew the water dropped off to over 20 ft deep right in front of where the moose was standing. I was feeling a little cocky and gave a small bull grunt. The bull moose took 2 steps and launched himself into the water and swam right at our boat. I circled the moose with my trolling motor and for the next 10 minutes had him swimming within 1 rod length away from us. I reached out several times with a 7ft spinning rod and touch the top of his rack. He stayed with us for a bit and then swam back to shore, up in the cedars and gone. My camera was on the kitchen table back at the cottage so no pictures.  What I think I'll always remember is my son trying to climb up on my Merc as the moose swam around the back end of my boat no more than 3 ft off the gunnels."

Seconds later I see a bolt in the corner of my eye and hear noises ive never heard before, then noticed it was the hawk, it had swooped down and taken out a morning dove that was sitting on the side of the road about 20 ft in front of me. The noises were from its companion trying to save it - with no luck. the hawk just sat there with the poor bird in its grasp-spreading its wings and puffin its chest at the loan survivor as if to say ""what you want some of this?"" --again a couple years ago, I was sitting on my buddies dock on the french river with some rye and gingers and chatting quietly listening to the loons call back and forth. when all of a sudden, we hear a loud splash about 100 ft out in the deep. and a loon just losing it !!, couple seconds later another splash, then silence... musky maybe ??"
721903,otter649,2012-08-11 21:10:00,118,"A few observations I've noticed at my cottage near Dorset :   Every spring I put up hummingbird feeder and on a couple occasions in the spring when the feeder has not been put up yet one or maybe two hummingbirds will hover outside the livingroom window and look inside as if to say ""Hurry up & fillup the feeder and hang it up - We're Hungry"". There are two birds that have been coming back for a few years now & it is interesting on how they feed off the feeder.One hovers beating his/her wings with the other one using a perch with no wing action.Both use the same feeder hole each time not going to the other's ones.There are two feeding openings.  One summer a couple of years ago with the deer & horse flies out in full force - I had a horse fly buzzing around my head when walking along a path to the lake when one of those big 4 winged purple coloured dragon flies came out of no where & grabbed the fly and then landed on my arm (I stopped walking) and proceeded to eat the horse fly before flying away.  Once out on a boat ride I approached an island where there was a short distance to the mainland but in the distance I saw what looked like some sort of lake monster ? since it had a head and shoulders with 3 humps behind it.When I got closer it turned out to be a mother racoon with 3 baby raccons swimming behind their mother in single file.   I once put some old looking cold cuts from the fridge for a raccoon who came by nightly but I did this in the afternoon so later that day I hear a thump on the roof - So what the heck made that noise ends up a turkey vulture landed there & then moved down to the deck and hopped over to the meat but a raven was with the vulture so it could be the raven followed the vulture since they have a keen sense of smell & they shared the spoils....."

Definitely nothing else. Not wild dogs, wayyyyy too big to be just dogs. They were about 5"" Taller than me and my buddy with me, we agreed. We creeped across the creek to watch them, and minutes later they saw us and took off. Im sure neither one of us will forget that. My mom has seen lone wolves in the area a few times as well while walking her dog on the trails."

Sitting on my watch looking into the run I heard a noise behind me. It was a bear running full tilt.  My first thought was ""cool"" and reached for my camera in my pocket. But the bear didn't stop and changed direction and headed right for me. I dropped my camera and pulled up my rifle, clicked the safety off and was about to pull the trigger when he stopped so suddenly that he rolled over himself, straightened out and took off as fast as he came in. He was only 20 feet away when he turned around. Wish I would have stayed with the camera. Would have been a great movie.  The next one would be when I was a teenager out hunting partridge. Walking through a trail near our hunt camp I proceeded up a small hump about 6 feet high in the trail. Steep enough that my head was down. When I got to the top, my head came up and came face to face with a bull moose, physically touching distance. He stood his ground and I ran the other way. Scared the crap outta me."

I'll leave the imagery for you to conger.  Also while hunting a few years back I had found an almost perfect stand....almost perfect as I didn't harvest a deer, but its still an awesome spot. I found a fallen tree in the side of a hill which overlooks a nice open ravine at the waters edge by our camp....the area is littered with sign. Where this tree fell uprooted so the roots created a nice hole in the hill, with the roots acting like a canopy so you can tuck your self in there and be invisible from the sides and above with a PERFECT unobstructed shot into the ravine. Well... I stuck myself in there and sat put for a few hours when i just could no longer hold it in....I had to clear my throat. Just asI did all hell broke lose!!!! Apparently a Bobcat or Lynx (not quite sure as it happened so fast) Had crept up to the hole I was in on the out side where I couldn't see her and she couldn't see me so she was RIGHT BESIDE ME....so when I cleared my thoat she freaked and bolted right in front of me...we're talking 2' to 3' LOL!!!!  It scared me so badly I Jumped to my feet in fear and Smashed my head on the roots above me ""just"" about knocking my self out LOL.... Thank god I had my safety on or I think I would have misfired for sure....both comical and cool.  On the cool side of thing once while fishing for Muskie in Moon river first week of November, we wereout after dark finishing up when I kept hearing a ton of splashes....and then I notced some of them were comming our way? I turned on the flash light to navigate our way home, and see what the hell was comming towards us, only to see several fish swimming with their heads out of the water, and the more I looked around with the flash light, the more glowing eyes of fish we noticed swiming at the surface....it was just odd???

722121,manitoubass2,2012-08-12 20:17:00,11391,"As a dood that spends alot of time in the bush, I've had alot of cool/close encounters.  I've had bears charge at me (had a post about it here last year).  I've had a pack of wolves spoil an ice fishing trip on the river last winter, where they actually attempted to cut us off/ambush us(that was unbelievably scary). We had drove the van to our spot, and parked up about 300 yards up on the hill. We just walked all our fishing gear down to the spot. We fished for a few hours, and as evening approached, I could hear one wolf howling about 200 yards west of us off the point. About 20 minutes later, there was now 2 wolves off the point. We had alot of gear to carry, so I told the kids we better not chance it. So we headed up with one load, I got the kids in the van and locked it up, gave my son the cell phone in case of an emergency and I headed down to grab the last load. It was now dark, and there was 3 wolves moving closure to the gear. The ol heart was racing pretty good at that point. I managed to get back up to the van and loaded the last of the gear. Just as I turned the lights on, about 15ft into the bush was 3 more wolves, and as I turned around, there was one more behind us. What a smart bunch of animals! I'm thoroughly convinced they had ambushed us! But for whatever reason, on that day, they didnt pounce??? I dont know, maybe it was just curiousity???  Up near Dryden ON, up on the 502 highway, me and my Dad were on our way portaging into a small lake, when all the sudden about 6-8 rabbits came cruising along in front of us. I though that was kinda odd??? About 5 seconds later a cougar came ripping through our path at what seemed like 200 km/h, haha. Thankfully it kept on its rabbit chase.  Another time on the same road (Cedar Narrows), we were camping on a small pristine lake, and got caught in a tornado. Man was it scary to have trees falling all around us in the pitch lack, only getting small glimpses of what was occuring when lightning would flash. I though we were all goners, but thankfully, we all lived to tell the tale, uninjured at that.  While doing a lease security a few years back, way up north on the B.C./Alberta border, I had been feeling the ground rumble for about 10 minutes. I was looking around at all the equipment, thinking something wasnt right? The rumbling was getting louder and louder, now the ground was vibrating pretty intensely. Only thing I could think to do was hop in my work truck and get a safe distance. Keep in mind, I'm in nomans land, at night after a fresh snowfall, so I was getting pretty paranoid. When I turned on the trick lights, I could see the glow of hundreds of eyes! I'm thinking what the hell is that??? They were running straight at me, hahahah. As the got close, I could tell they were elk or something of the like. They continued on their path straight at me, and only moved mere inches to avoid the truck as a whole pack ran by full steam, shaking the ground enough to give it earthquake status, hahaha. That really scared the snot outta me.  I'm loving this thread! Some really good reads on here!"
722126,ehg,2012-08-12 20:44:00,2666,This is a great thread with lots of incredible stories. Seems like the close encounters with wolves are the scariest. Like manitoubass' story above.  Have had close encounters with moose in Algonquin. About 20 yrs. ago at Booth Lake went out early in morning for bass. On way to canoe there was a female moose standing still about 20 feet away trying to hide behind tree. I am sure it thought it was hiding even though it was huge and quite visible. It didn't move and i just stood there and looked at it. Eventually i decided to just go fishing.  Coolest thing i saw the other day in park here in downtown T.O. A robin was chasing a monarch butterfly. The butterfly would pause go straight up vertically the robin tried the same unsuccessfully. The butterfly dropped straight down the robin followed. Then it turned 180 degrees. etc.... The butterfly got away with its crazy flight pattern and ability. The robin just went back to pulling worms from ground i guess.

We got up one morning and the four of us where having our breakfast and planning our walleye assault for the day  Jamie says ""What the hell is that swimming out near the island""  We look and figure it is a moose but it's at least a half mile maybe more out, so it's real hard too tell. We grab cameras and jump in the two tinnies and motor out. Sure enough it's a big cow moose and shes a good half mile or more from the closest shore. We where all awestruck by how powerful of a swimmer she was. Her wake was about the same as the 8HP motors on our boats !!! We circle around her within touching distance for about 5-10 minutes and get a ton of pictures then back off as we where concerned about tiring her out as she was a loooonnng way from shore. We didn't have to worry. She didn't even make an attempt to swim to the closest shore. She aimed for a point down our side of the lake and swam straight for it. We kept an eye on her until she got out of the water. Our collective guess was that the point was well over 2 miles away. I had no idea a moose could swim like that.  This was back in the 80's. I had at least 20 pictures of the event and had them in an envelope in my  locker at work to show whoever might wanna see them. I came into work after a week off for holidays to find my work area had been reorganized. Somehow in the move my envelope of pictures was lost. I'm still a little upset over it"

All of a sudden we hear crashing and look up, here is this big bull moose running through the bush being chased by a pack of wolves. Ran right through the area we were clearing and didn't even notice us. At the same location, we were coming to the area we were working on an a bull moose is standing in the middle of the road. Bus driver decides to blow the horn and the damn moose charges the bus.  Another instance we're staying at a cottage on the French River and notice these two small animals.

So what did we do, grab the kids and the dogs and went out for a boat ride.  We ended up dumping the kids on a small island on the lake maybe 200 feet by 50 feet.  We spent the next hour fishing all around the island while the 4 kids played on the island with 3 dogs.  All was going well as we could always see see or at least hear the kids running around.  Then we hear a big splash and figure the boys had had enough a tossed one of the girls in the water.  We come flying around the corner and a Doe and a small fawn had jumped in and were swimming back to shore.  The kids and the dogs never saw the deer.  How could 4 kids be so close to 2 deer for so long and never see them or push them out sooner."
722474,jigsnreels,2012-08-14 12:23:00,133,"I have three that come to mind:  I actually got snotted by a killer whale during a whale watching trip in BC.  A blowhole is basically a giant nostril, and I was at the receiving end of a six-ton sneeze as I was looking over the bow of the boat I was in.  Think of ""Ghostbusters"" - it was kind of like that.  It was seriously disgusting.  Listening to all the wisecracks from my fellow passengers on the ride back wasn't much fun, either.  My family and I lived in Alberta for awhile, and we had a snowmobile.  My dad used to let me take it out for little trips around the farmers' fields, and one time I was out in the middle of some pasture and I stopped to get my bearings and just enjoy the silence.  After a few minutes I noticed a little field mouse emerge from a hole near the trail, and I just sat there quietly and watched him for a bit, as he didn't seem too concerned that I was there.  He should have been more concerned about the snowy owl that swooped in without a sound and snatched him up in his talons, not five feet away from where I was sitting.  I nearly soiled my snowsuit, I was so freaked out...  It was one of the most amazing (and scary!) sights I've ever seen.  Those birds are the ultimate stealth fighters.  This one doesn't really count as ""the wild,"" but I'll never forget the Christmas morning that my family and I woke up to the sight of a huge bull moose standing right in our front yard.  He peered in the living room window at us for what seemed like an eternity, and then he just turned and trotted off down the street.  Amazing."

I stopped for lunch having a tuna sandwich and hot chocolate from my thermos, I just sat down in the middle of the abandoned road on a long straight stretch.  It was absolutely DEAD quiet.  Every chew and gulp were the only sounds heard until finishing my food, then it was just my breath.  No wind... silent.  To both sides of me were the stunted black spruce one would find in the muskeg.  Not thick like jungle, it was dense enough that you could only see in and through the bush various short distances.  Being that it was March, there had actually been a mild spell of weather that compressed the snow, and now it had all refroze to hard pack off the trails that in most places I could walk atop the crust and not break through.  When deciding to walk on I got up and took a few steps before an eerie feeling shot straight up through my spine like a bullet.  To my left, something inside the spruce and invisible to me took steps as well and then stopped just one of two seconds after I did.  It was loud enough that it was breaking through the snows crust making that crushing sound.  Dead in my tracks I paused, listened a moment but heard nothing more.  I began to walk on and only got a few more steps in before whatever was in the bush began walking again.  Same thing... loud steps from something I could not see, but I felt that this thing in the bush was right on top of me.  When I stopped, it took a step then stopped as well.  I waited longer, scanning the bush, looking into every shadow in the spruce, heart pounding in my chest.  Nothing???  Again, I took some steps and the same thing happened.  Crunch, crunch, crunch and it stopped an instant too late after I stopped.  It was at this point I pulled my knife from the sheath at my hip.  It was a knife like the one Rambo has, with the hollow handle for putting stuff in, the compass on the butt and a good long solid blade.  There'd be no outrunning whatever was in the bush, not in Sorels and heavy clothing, in the middle of nowhere's nowhere along a long stretch of vacant ice road.  With the knife in my hand I tried to tease steps out of whatever was stalking me, but now it was gone.  I didn't hear another sound.  My plan was to walk another mile or so up the road, then use a bush trail to loop me back to the Monument Channel and walk that river home.  On route I stumbled upon a well used game trail and followed it into the bush until it ended in a tiny clearing where all the tracks cirled about but must have left the way they came.  On eight of the trees there was orange tape that I noticed first, before then seeing the chains go under the snow.  It was then I realized I'd walked into traps set by someone and was very likely standing on top of some.  But, as I said before, the thaw and refreeze had made the snow crusty and I could walk atop of it.  And, at the time I was only about 160 pounds.  I didn't know if the traps were set, I just very gingerly retraced my steps out of the clearing.  Whatever had been in the bush that day broke through the crust with every step it took."
721586,SylvanOwner,2012-08-10 16:16:00,266,"Great thread Dan!!!  Some really terrific stories coming out, mine is not about something scary....unless you have a butterfly phobia  A little over 20 years ago I was invited to stay for a few days at a cottage on Long Point (north shore of Lake Erie).  The three of us went for a walk in the marsh and on the way back came across a Monarch butterfly migration.  All the butterflys were landed on the vegetation on either side of the trail and were so thick there was more butterfly than leaves for about a 100m stretch.  Not one of us had brough a camera with us and it was getting a bit late in the day so we decided we'd come back the next morning and take pictures.  The wind and temperatures must have been perfect for an attempt across the lake because when we went back the next day there wasn't a single Monarch to be found."

721592,danbouck,2012-08-10 16:47:00,4380,When I was young I had stayed over at my Grandparents house and we had seen a completely white buck standing beside the forest. We decided to get a little closer and we were able to walk right up to it. We were literally 1 foot away from him and I was able to pet him. I wish we had a picture.
721593,davis,2012-08-10 16:47:00,128,"Great stuff. I think I posted this one a while ago in another thread, but hands down the weirdest sight I've ever experienced in the outdoors was when a deer swam out to the boat me and my 2 friends were fishing in on a small'ish river, circled us (close enough to reach out and touch it) and then attempted to get in the boat. We couldn't believe what we were seeing, and managed to snap a couple of shots on the disposable camera we had with us. After getting over the initial shock we decided it'd be best to move away from the crazy deer - plus my friend who owned the boat was pissed about it getting whacked by the deer's hooves. It swam after us for a few mins before heading back to shore and stalked us from the shoreline for the next hour. We later learned from some locals further down the river that it was most likely a ""tame"" deer that many of the cottagers fed on a regular basis. We thought the thing had some sort of disease. I doubt we'll ever experience something like that again."
721600,DoubleDigits,2012-08-10 17:21:00,140,"My brother and I were fishing off Moreton Island, Australia, in his 19 ' boat when a pod of very frisky humpbacks came just about as close as you would want. The whales were a common sight at that time of year, but it was something else to look over the side and see the blue water turn black. I could make out the barnacles and texture of its back as it slowly glided under us, so close I could have dipped my 7' rod into the water and touched it. He came to the surface about 25 feet beside us, side on, and just sort of floated there looking at us as if to show how huge he was. He gave a sort of hostile kick of the tail and left us alone.  A few days later in the same area we witnessed at very close range, humpbacks herding up and feeding on massive schools of bait. We were marking huge balls of bait when the surface began to bubble and boil not far from the boat. Big clouds of air bubbles were rising to the surface. Our first thought was some sort of gas being released from the bottom, until the big open mouth of a whale came up through the foam and took a giant gulp of fish, which we could make out, flying out of the water. The feeding continued as we drifted away, and when I got home I looked it up, and sure enough, humpback whales do that!  Once a friend and I pulled over to pee at the side of a logging road not far from Cobalt, Ontario. As I stared into the bush, I saw a lynx (much bigger that I thought they were!) about 15 feet away, staring straight at me. He stood motionless for 10 seconds or so, then disappeared."
721612,CRUD150,2012-08-10 17:51:00,87,"Great thread!  One that come to mind vividly:  My wife an I were snowmobiling back into Cochrane from Quebec late one season in April. It is about a 100 mile stretch and we had not seen one other sled on the trail the whole way. About 15 miles before Cochrane we came across three lynx on the trail, moma and two cubs that were nearly as tall as her. As we slowed and aproached, mom went left and sat in the pines only about 3 yards off the trail, the cubs broke off trail to the right. My wife pulled up behind me and started to fumble around trying to get the camera out. As I looked back to see what was taking her so long, she started pointing ahead of me and could only articulate a ""woo  .... wooo"", her eyes went as big as saucers. I turned and looked ahead to see that the two cubs had come back onto the trail and were calmly sniffing around the front bumper of my sled! ( an Arctic Cat of course). After what seemed like a long time but was probably only 30 seconds, with two very large wild cats at an arms length, moma let out a long low growl and the two cubs imediatley obeyed and skipped off into the bush and quickley disappeared into the pines with moma. It took us a while before we picked our jaws up out of the snow and even began to speak about the amazing encounter we just expirienced!  "
721633,jimmer,2012-08-10 19:09:00,2730,"So many amazing stories by everyone! 1) Sitting quietly while bow hunting, heard a rustle close by, turned to look and it was a coyote/bush wolf sitting about 10 feet away looking at me. Next think you know he was howling at me and I broke out laughing. 2) Just this spring while lake trout fishing there was a family of mergansers swimming across the lake when there was a splash, my buddy said ""did you see that?"" He thought a  fish had grab one of the chicks, but then it happened again and we realized it was loons attacking them from underneath. The loons didn't let up until the chicks were nowhere to be seen. 3)I live on the lake and like most we have a goose problem. Coming in from fishing the other day there was a bunch of them relaxing on the neighbours lawn. I took a second look and there was a fox walking around between them all like they were a big happy family. I was hoping that fox liked eating goose! :-) 4)Watched a small hawk from my pool pluck every feather out of his dinner and then feast. He didn't care that I was watching."
721634,kemper,2012-08-10 19:19:00,2232,"I forgot a good one...nature from the great INdoors!  Sitting at the kitchen table having a coffee and looking out the window with my old man (we live in suburbia). All of the sudden this streak of grey flashes past the window and slams into the lawn, feathers flying everywhere. Some type of bird of prey (I don't know much about birds) had come down and knocked a smaller bird out of the air and pummelled it into the ground, killing it instantly.  The hawk (falcon?) grabbed the victim in its talons and flew away. My dad and I were left staring in awe and couldn't manage to say anything other than ""COOL!""."
721650,Rod Caster,2012-08-10 20:57:00,5784,"Great thread idea Dan!  1- I was reeling in my line, watching my lure as it approached the boat. Just as I was pulling my lure out of the water, a huge silhouette rushes up towards my lure, makes a huge splash in the water, jumps out of the water and..... fly's away! haha, I took me a few seconds to realize this was not a flying fish but a loon/duck. Completely messed me up for a few seconds, I thought I was losing my mind.  2- While I lived in Alert for a few months the local Arctic wolves would nip at our boots and snow pants while walking around. The first time I walked onto the tundra alone I was surrounded by this pack of 6 or 7 very tall wolves. They just eyed me out for a while and then turned. I later learned after telling my story, that the wolves were just looking for me to kick up some lemmings or rabbits from the rocks.  Those are the two that come to mind"
721662,ctranter,2012-08-10 21:20:00,543,"I have two instances to share.  The first happened when I was 12 or 13 and we were heading in to town to grab groceries at the cottage by car.  A huge cougar leaped out of the bushes, nearly over the hood of the car, in one single jump it had cleared the road and was long gone in the bushes.  We are in the Parry Sound area and haven't spotted another since.  The second (hopefully not once in a lifetime) happened just a few days ago when I realized we had wild, nesting Peregrine Falcons on our property.  I was there with a friend and he snapped some great shots, which may be once in a lifetime images.  If he gets me the pics soon, I'll post one!"
721664,danc,2012-08-10 21:34:00,4677,"Some great reads here guys. Thanks for sharing.  One more from me that is similar to trevy727's story of the cat chasing the rabbit across the road. About a dozen years ago I spent the summer in Nakina working on a new sawmill. With lots of daylight after work, of course we went fishing practically every night. We had heard of a lake to try which was about a 10 mile drive down a gravel road. There were rabbits every 50 yards or so along this road. Suddenly a rabbit being chased by a Lynx came running out of the bush and ran along side of our truck and at the same speed. This pair was not 5 feet from the truck and they continued to run along side of us for at least 5 seconds. What an amazing sight that was. The obviously hungry Lynx didn't care at all about us in the truck. The only thing on his mind was dinner. It all ended when the rabbit turned back into the bush with the Lynx right on his tail."
721673,JoshS,2012-08-10 22:13:00,729,"Neat thread. I've not spent a ton of time in northern ontario but down here I saw a hawk grab a squirrel from a tree in my backyard in the city. I had a group of 6 deer walk right past me last winter on the credit like I wasn't even there, could of touched them with my float rod.  Do you remember that thread about pike swimming with their head out of water? Well, the first time I saw it I was at a cottage with a bunch of friends long ago and we found an old spear lying around. We were hooting and hollering and jokingly/drunkingly someone yelled, ""let's go spear a fish!!"" (I know, I know). We proceeded to the dock in the middle of the night to see a big pike swim right up to the foot of the dock in the moonlight with it's head out of the water while I stood there with a big spear in my hand staring at it completely amazed. I obviously didn't spear it to my friends dismay (makes me laugh thinking about it) but still cannot believe it came right up to us under those circumstances.  For the record I would never spear a fish HAHA and took the reigns of the spear that night just in case it landed in the wrong hands.  One time at a remote lake in Quebec I was fishing off a dock at dawn and a spherical ball of light (baseball size to the eye) cleared the horizon and ripped across the sky. Not sure what the heck that was."
721676,crappieperchhunter,2012-08-10 22:16:00,2582,One time I was a backseat passenger on the drive home from ice fishing on Nip. I looked out the window of the car and saw a group of sparrows flying out in the middle of an empty field towards the tree line on one side. Up in the treeline behind them on an old dead treetop was a hawk. He swooped down from his perch and headed straight for the sparrows about 100 yards away. When he was within 50 feet of the sparrows they knew something was up and split off all in different directions. He homed in on one of them. It was zigging and zagging all over the place but he matched it move for move and was gaining. Finally he caught up to it and nailed it with a claw. There was a small puff of feathers on impact. The last thing we saw before we drove past was him lumbering back up to his perch with his prize.
721685,Acountdeleted,2012-08-10 22:38:00,2562,"These are probably ho hum for most of the OFC members but for me they will always stand out.  When I was tree planting in Hearst on the first day and last day of the season I saw the Northern Lights. The first night it was like a living breathing mass, slowly expanding and contracting, the last night it was entirly stationary but looked like a race track that started miles off in the distance and hooked right above where we were.  Another year of tree plant I saw the starting point of a rainbow which I had never seen before, saw an upside down rainbow once which was really cool.  To be perfectly honest though the things that I most classify as ""once in a lifetime"" would be the sunsets on the lakes in North Western Ontario, Kenora, Dryden and the like on the fly in lakes. It was hard being at some of those and realizing I will probabally never be there again."

I'd hazzard to guess that not one other person on the planet has seen what I'm about to describe.  The Minnesota border is only a half hour drive from Thunder Bay, where I live. We go there often. Near the U.S/ Canada border, on the Canadian side, resides a taxidermist. He has a sign out along the highway advertising his business. A few years ago, Nita and I were on our way to Minnesota to pick up some packages. As we approached the taxidermists sign, we noticed a bear standing upright on it's back legs not two feet away from the sign. Wow. Good advertising I thought. It looks so real. This guy does nice work! I don't know why I did, but I looked in my rear view mirror after we passed the sign and the bear. What I saw next blew my mind. The bear dropped down on all fours and proceeded to run across the highway. It was a real bear. I've seen hundreds and hundreds of bears in the wild, but this is the first and only time that I've seen one standing upright. Just like you'd see a bear mounted by a taxidermist. Absolutely true story."

I engaged the safety on my browning, and lay it on the ground and prepared to relieve myself. I stood there enjoying the feeling of solitude, when i felt watched.I very slowly turned my head to peek behind me, and when i did, i almost fainted. No more than 20 feet from me, and standing on the trail in plain view, was a huge,fully antlered Bull Moose.It was so close i could smell it and here its breathing.I have no idea how it got so close without me seeing or hearing it. After what seemed like an hour, it grunted, and turned its back to me and trotted off into the bush.I then realized that i had peed on my boots and gun."

721476,danc,2012-08-10 02:50:00,4677,"Every once in a while I still picture this moment in my head, to this day. While tenting on Lake Nipigon, I had to get up in the middle of the night to releive myself. We were camped on a small bay and the moon was full. I grabbed my flashlight and left the tent to do my thing. I didn't need to turn the flashlight on because the full moon lit up the campground like it was mid day. While doing my thing I heard a solitary Canada Goose in the bay let out a weak honk. Cool, I thought. After I was done I turned on the flashlight to see if I could spot this lone Goose in the bay. Then all hell broke loose. Several hundred Canada Geese took off from the bay and flew right across the full moon right before my eyes, in the middle of the night. What an amazing sight that was. Silhouetted Goose after Goose flying in front of the full moon right before my eyes in the middle of the night for probably well over a minute.

I caught and released 3 specks in about a half hour of fishing when I heard what sounded like lots of tree branches breaking. I figured moose or beaver but across the lake a wolf walks out of the bush to the water's edge. Then 2 more that I could see. They were much bigger than I thought they would be. They stood and stared for about 5 minutes and then took off.  About 10 minutes later, I have my 4th trout on the line and I hear rustling just to my left. I look over and one of the wolves is slowly creeping up the shoreline, maybe 50 feet from me. The nearest people were a mile or 2 away at best and I was kinda scared. Landed my fish then yelled as I threw a rock. The wolf bolted when the rock splashed in the water. I caught another trout a few minutes later and then packed up and left.  People with decades of bush experience say this will likely never happen to me again. I hope not."

721497,spincast,2012-08-10 09:47:00,3279,"Camping at Mew or Pog Lake on May 24 weekend. It was oneof those winters where all of  the great lakes froze over during the winter in the early '90.s  As we drove into the park there were still big blue-green skabs of ice hanging under the rocks wherever the sun didn't shine on them.  The weather was more like mid April then mid May with sunny days and below freeing nights. We just pulled into our site. I was scoping it out and had been looking at the river that ran behind the site. I turn around and at the end of the path to our site, broad side staring at me is a she wolf. We just look at each other for at least 60 seconds, neither moving. It was like she was looking at me saying ""what is one of you doing here in this weather?"". I was just enjoying the view. After that she ploped off into a rock pile. I went to see if she was still around later, but she was gone. I am positive she had cubs somewhere nearby  Another time I was up at a lodge with a friend. We were down at the farthest end from the lodge on a small lake. We were the only people there that weekend and it was peaceful and quiet. Its just after dawn and that great time of the morning when the birds are singing and silence otherwise rules. We are enjoing the atmosphere (even though we have ony caught one fish so far). Suddenly we start to hear a plashing sound. We look around and about 200 yerds from us is a cow moose with her calf. The plashing had been their feet in the shallow water as they stepped into it each time. Over the next 30 minutes we watched them as they wound their way around the lake. They would enter the woods for a few minutes then re-appear, plashing along the shore line.  The last one was 2 years ago;  we were up  in Gowganda. 3 of us in a boat all casting to shore for bass. Suddenly we hear this really strange sound building up behind us. We turn around and see this:  .  we watched in awe as the wind whipped the water into this spout, and it then travelled along the water at about a 45 degree angle toward us, getting closer as it came along.   We were so gob smacked it took us at least a minute before we grabbed our cameras, and no one even thought to get a vid, which would have been cool becuase the sound that accompanied it was like a 1000 hands slapping the water as the wind made  a perfect circle at the base. After a couple minutes it started to die down, eventually becoming just a circle of waves on the water making that slapping sound and then disappearing completely.    "
721498,crappieperchhunter,2012-08-10 09:53:00,2582,Not as outdoorsy as some others mentioned...this happened in my back yard. I was out puttering around in my vegetable garden. Concentrating on my chores I started to hear a humming sound...but never gave it any thought. The sound got louder so I finally stood up to see what the hell was making all the noise. My whole backyard an area approx 50 feet by 70 feet was full off bees! The swarm was about 7 feet off the ground and about 10 feet deep. They where everywhere.  I stood very still and just watched them. After a few minutes they swarmed into a neighbors spruce tree and made a huge lump/mass in one of the trees. I was told later the queen bee was probably in that mass and they where protecting her.  Left for my sons soccer game shortly after and when we came back from soccer the bees where gone.  It was a once in a lifetime experience that I'm sure I will never forget.
721503,trevy727,2012-08-10 10:54:00,351,"My father and I used to fish a lake about 2 hours north of Kenora every year. We'd take the tent trailer and stay over night and fish 2 days and come home. One time, on our arrival, we were just starting to set the trailer up and dad told me to be quiet and look. I looked over on the bridge and a bobcat was walking towards us about 50' away. It seemed to not notice us and came to within 25' before turning and heading into the bush.  On another occasion coming home from the same lake, it was dusk and there were many scattered rabbits along the road. As we'd come up to them, they'd bolt into the bush. Well one rabbit bolted across the road in front of the truck and behind it came a huge cat. I still swear it was a cougar but my father insists it was a linx. I remember it being orange ish and having a long tail.  One last time coming home from the same lake, we had my sisters boyfriend with us this time. Driving along and saw something strange on the road in the distance, got the video camera out and crept up to see two linx play fighting in the middle of the road. We recorded them for about two minutes before they wandered off into the bush.  Living in the north was a fantastic place to see many moose, bears and the occasional big cat and wolf. I truly miss it and hope to return to Kenora for good in the near future.  My sisters ex has the video of the cats, I'll ask him if he can send it to me sometime. Maybe I can post it."

Now my boy was still young (teens)---I said ok this is what we're gonna do----I yelled at the wolves thinking they may spook----nope--need new idea  We had single shot 12 ga's---I fired a round into the ground---surely that would send them on their way----nope  So I said we'd take turns shooting over the wolves heads---never at same time leaving at least one loaded gun (remember single shots)--told him not to shoot at the wolves if we did'nt have to-----we did'nt  So breaking branches over their heads for about 4-5 rounds sent them into the thicker stuff allowing us to pass  And of course when braveheart gets 20 feet from my truck--I let out a howl-----they howled back---right behind us  So I once in a while remind my boy that very few of his friends--or people in general have been thru something like this.

Dust Devil While driving near Lucknow a few years ago a large dust devil about 6-7 feet high slowly crossed the road in front of us.  It then travelled right up a driveway for more then a hundred feet before it died away right at the house.  Whooping cranes While fishing at a small remote lake in Grey county Ontario. I heard very loud coming from across the lake.  As they moved closer I was able to see 3 Whooping cranes doing some sort of mating dance.  They would do it for a while then move to another location and do it again.  The sound was so loud it seemed to reverberate for miles.  Fighting deer Many years ago back in New Brunswick I was in the back yard stacking firewood with my father.  We started to hear a loud commotion in the woods just beyond our yard and soon recognized the grunts of a couple whitetail bucks.  They were snorting and going on and then all hell broke loose.  There was the sound of sticks and bushes breaking, then the sound of their hooves running around.  Because it was after dark it was hard to see what was going on but they would run out onto our back lawn then the unmistakable sound of antlers crashing and rattling.  They would retreat into the bushes then come running back out and clash again.  This went on for 5 or 10 minutes.  Swarming eels While fishing a large lake in New Brunswick over 20 years ago,  I noticed a disturbance on the surface of the water quite some distance away.  I motored over to see what it was and it turned out the be a large ball of American Eels.  There must have been dozens if not hundreds of them.  The ball was about 5 or 6 feet in diameter.  It should be mentioned that there are still plenty of eels left in NB and small commercial fishery exists.  So it’s not uncommon to see them but this ball of them I had never seen before.  Since they mate out to sea I still don’t know what they were doing.  Perhaps there was something large in the middle they were feeding on and they were all trying to tear it apart.    Bobcat in the bushes While bird hunting back in NB, I noticed a pair of eyes close to the ground staring at me from some thick brush.  It was a grey foggy morning and the eyes seemed to be glowing.  They never moved.  I stood still and stared back for a very long time trying to figure out what they belonged to.  I finally realized they were attached to a bobcat.  We just stared at each other for probably 10 minutes until I finally relented and moved on.  I had never seen one in the wild before and have never seen one since.  "

721524,SmokestackLightnin,2012-08-10 13:22:00,390," I would suspect that these were Sandhill Cranes. There are only about 400 Whooping cranes left in the world and most of them are in the midwest. Currently there are not reported sightings of Whooping Cranes in Ontario. I had 2 Sandhill Cranes fly over my boat last Saturday while fishing the Pickeral River, it's the first time I have seen them there."

721532,Luke V.,2012-08-10 13:47:00,286,"Awesome Idea for a thread.  1) While fishing in AP on Cedar Lake with my Dad and little brother. We were behind a small island on a rather hot day, were not 20' from shore when a Black Bear comes out from the island walks into the water and swims within 30' of our boat. He continued accross the channel and onto main land. Was quite the sight to see.  2) Again while up at Cedar Lake. Camping on the main land. It was mid day, everyone was out hanging around playing cards and sunbathing. I was laying in the sun in the middle of the feild drying off. All you can hear is what sounds like a horse coming down the road. To our surprise it was a yearling moose. I dont think I have ever got up and ran so fast. He tried to run straight through our campsite and down into the water, but stopped turned and headed up and into the bush. This is something I will never forget."

Suddenly we notice this huge fire ball in the sky, we thought is was a meteor as it ripped from horizon to horizon... It wasn't until we got home that we found out that a Russian Satelite had crashed in the Prairies... kinda a cool site... Yah, we took pics, but didn't really get anything out of my 110 pocket camera! HH"
721538,NAW,2012-08-10 14:02:00,4022,"I was riding some mountain bike trails for the first time in a bush on the shores of lake Simcoe.  I had never ridden these trails before, but was pretty sure there was a nice little area that i could get to with a view of the lake.  After about 30 minutes of bombing around the trails, I pop out right on the shore of lake Simcoe.  Figure it's a good place to stop and have a drink of water.  That's when I hear the roar of a float plane taking off.  Cool, a nice little extra peace of scenery right!.  I couldn't see the plane because of the trees. Once the plane came out from behind the trees, and realized that there was TWO planes, which where both flying low.  One was taking off, and the other was just flying low.  Both where about 300 meters up.  I thought these guys where stunt pilots or something, working on a routine.  But the reality was, they didn't even know one and other where there.  The two planes crashed in mid air right in front of me.  One plane was able to land safely.  However,  the other nose dived straight in to the water, killing both occupants on impact.  I swear had 911 on the phone before the plane hit the water.  The sound of the plane hitting the water was like a bomb going off.  The sad thing is, the plane which crashed hard, was taking off from a family cottage.  They had their family in a chase boat buzzing along behind them, getting a good view of the take off.  They where first on scene, and where able to dive in and pull their family members (Grandfather and father) out of the plane before it sunk..  Horrible thing to watch, and something that I will never forget."
721540,mattp33,2012-08-10 14:08:00,290,"When I was much younger, a few friends and I would go to this small canoe in lake in ontario.  Well this 1 weekend we were there camping fighing and of course we were young and just of age so we were driking a lot!  We were on a very small isolated camp site about 100 feet from the waters edge where our canoe was tied up to a large rock.  The first night went off without a hitch and the next moring we were feeling kinda crappy as we were hung over.  Needless to say the camp ground didn't get cleaned as there were way more important things to drink that day.  As night fell and my buddy had passed out early for the second night I decided it was time to eat.  As I am by the camp fire with my flashlight cooking my can of zoodles on an open fire, I can here noise in the bush to my right.  I shinned the flashlight but saw nothing.  Again I here it kinda behind me. look...nothing.  Now I here it to my left,  I very quickly shined my high powered 50million candlke power light to my right again, and there it is!  The biggest grey wolf I have ever seen sitting in the middle of my spot light staring at me.  As i looked all around I saw the pack that had circled around me.  My drunk thoughts at the time is they are waiting until I eat to eat ME!  I run to the tent screaming at my sleeping friend Jon ""DUDE WERE DEAD MEAT!  THE COYOTES ARE GOING TO GET US!""  To my surprise he grumbles at me and says to to bed potter your crazy!  I spent the next hour widdling a stick to a point with my finger nails watching this pack completly clean out all the food from out site including my can of zoodles!  I will never forget this night for the rest of my life!  To this day Jon an I joke about my bravery that night!  That was fun!  thanks"
721542,Broker,2012-08-10 14:09:00,482,"Moose tracks - While at AP I was with a friend for a bike ride on a trail at around 8:30-9 oclock we were heading home, with only one route to get back to the campsite. On the way back I notice big moose tracks in the sand, i thought it was cool, carried on, came around a bend, and 2 big moose lay before me, a bull and cow. Standing nearly 20 feet away I thought this was quite neat, for the first 20 minutes.. Then I was like cmon, move over so we can get by as im getting eating alive by bugs. At about 10 I started making noises to try and scare them off but nothing, so i threw some rocks there way, then nothing, so i get on my bike and back up, and here galloping! The moose was chasing me down the road, they would stop and continue eating then get on the chase again, they dragged me back a whole KM and I was scared. I decided I would take a detour though the forest on my bike to get around them which worked. Boy was it hard to sleep that night"

Intense evening in the bush!
721562,Carp,2012-08-10 15:05:00,1488,"I used to bow hunt a property just northeast of Newmarket, ON.  One morning, an hour or so after daylight, I was in my tree stand and heard something coming through the bush to the open field. It was a big old whitetail doe running fast, but not full out. I could hear her heavy breathing and could tell she was tired. She followed the edge of the bush in front of me and around a corner to my left. A few minutes later, 3 Wolves (not coyotes) came out to the corner of the field where she has ran out. 1 was about the size of a full grown German Sheppherd and coloured similar to a Husky. The other 2 were about double the size and all black. They stopped and looked around and at each other as if to communicate or formulate a plan. The small one and 1 big wolf followed the deer's trail around the corner. The other big wolf doubled back to cut her off as she tried to get back through the bush where she came from. It was amazing to witness the intelligence of these animals and see them carry out a plan to get that doe, other than just trying to catch up to her from behind.  After a few minutes, the 2 that were following the deer came back out to the field's corner, looking around and listening for the doe. I never did see the other wolf again. He was still in the bush behind me somewhere, waiting for the doe to try and get by him. I made a soft doe call and they started coming toward me, but were really spooked, as if they knew something wasn't right. I was in the bush about 20 yards from the edge of the field. They skirted around the tree I was in, like they knew I was there, always keeping about 20 to 25 yards away. Then they walked behind a small bush......and disappeared. I was waiting for them to come out from the other side, but no such luck. There wasn't much around that small bush except a few twigs. The bush was barely large enough to hide them. Where the heck did they go ? I began thinking I had fallen asleep and was dreaming. Now I was the one who was spooked. Well, my hunt was over for the morning, but I waited at least an hour before getting down out of the tree to make sure they had left. Made lots of noise on the way out too. Never saw them again.  Probably won't ever witness this again in my lifetime, so it's a memory I cherish, even though it's a reminder of how vicious and cruel nature can be."
721566,solopaddler,2012-08-10 15:17:00,8605,"So many great stories!  Camped on an island on Agnes lake in Quetico park I emerged from my tent to find a massive wolf, pushing 1800- 200lb's standing 20' away staring at me.  I froze and we locked eyes for probably 30 seconds. No menace from the animal at all, then it slowly turned and walked away.  It was almost a religious experience.  Another time on the Frog river (big trib of the Winisk) I had three polar bears raid my camp at night.  That was most definitely not a religious experience LOL!  Only animal that truly gives me pause.  I've got a million more stories. Gonna stop now before I get too chatty."
