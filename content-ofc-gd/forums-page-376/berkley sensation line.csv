722795,kickingfrog,2012-08-15 20:12:00,8333,"It was the only mono I used to use. Haven't used it in years though.  2lb, 4lb and 6lb on small spinning reels worked well, but I use a braid or fused line now."
722796,bare foot wader,2012-08-15 20:12:00,1354,"I like it, better than the xl IMO  less stretch than xl and much better handling than xt...I like it for bottom bouncing winter steelhead when it's too freezing cold for braids"
722801,JoshS,2012-08-15 20:27:00,729,I hear great things about the new seagar senshi mono line. http://www.seaguar.com/products/senshi.htm  I've always just used XT and never had issues with it or the old excaliber silverthread.
