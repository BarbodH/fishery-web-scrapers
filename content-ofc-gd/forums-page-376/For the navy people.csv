722146,Roy,2012-08-12 23:02:00,13728,It's the USS Fort Worth. http://www.theshipwatcher.com/
722176,blue pickeral,2012-08-13 01:45:00,267,It is a ship. A boat is a submarine.
722178,kickingfrog,2012-08-13 01:50:00,8333,There it is.
722455,beaser,2012-08-14 05:29:00,19,A gun boat on steroids! (It's still a ship tho) It's about 40 ft shorter than HMCS Iroquois. Looks like 3 propulsion systems Oyvey
