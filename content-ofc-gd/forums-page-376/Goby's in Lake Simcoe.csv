722674,issamhay,2012-08-15 03:00:00,77,"Hi all I would just like to ask if anyone here has caught round gobies in Simcoe, almost every time i go fishing in Kempenfelt Bay I catch round gobies, today I caught 4 gobies fishing for perch, does MNR know about this?"
722676,kickingfrog,2012-08-15 03:10:00,8333,Unfortunately they have taken hold and I'm afraid are hear to stay.
722678,musky_hunter,2012-08-15 03:19:00,328,bass love goby...caught few on rice last saturday  
722679,BillM,2012-08-15 03:35:00,17367,"You now know why there are 8lb+ smallmouth swimming out in Lake Simcoe, lol."
722682,BradMc76,2012-08-15 04:03:00,56,"These things are going nuts around here. I'm at Lake Ontario, and pulled this beast out today. May not be much, overall, but the biggest I've seen.  "
722683,Cudz,2012-08-15 04:43:00,2652,I caught a bass the other day on simcoe that puked up a 5 inch goby and the fish was only about 1 pound. Caught 2 gobies the other day fishing for perch about 100 yards off shore near Hooters family restaurant.
722685,Sinker,2012-08-15 05:18:00,8692,I've even caught them thru the ice!! Its loaded with them!  S.
722697,d_paluch,2012-08-15 12:30:00,343,"Just got a cottage out on fox island. Thought I would throw a minnow trap off the dock to catch some minnows for a perch dinner. Not only did we not get 1 minnow, but we got 5 gobies. Too bad we can't use them as bait  Guess that's what the goby imitations are for"
722725,issamhay,2012-08-15 15:11:00,77,mmm to me those look like sculpin in the pics not round goby hard to tell without a shot of the pelvic fins.
722727,Luke V.,2012-08-15 15:24:00,286,Erie and Lake O are very much the same. It isnt unusual to catch 10-15 during a morning or perch fishing.  But they are making the bass massive
722736,kickingfrog,2012-08-15 16:06:00,8333,"  First one is definitely a goby, can't say for the second one."

It's hard to tell for sure.  I deffinitally catch a lot of goby in Kemp when perch fishing.  Getting worse and worse."
722740,captpierre,2012-08-15 16:17:00,2521,"I know smallies eat gobies.  And they are growing bigger than ever.  Is it not also true, that they also clean out bass nests and have impacted numbers of young bass?  I thought I heard on Erie there are few smaller bass caught.  Or is that Bull?  peter"
722768,misfish,2012-08-15 18:33:00,29133,"Lots of them being caught off the break wall at Heritage park. More of them then, perch or bass."
722770,Cudz,2012-08-15 18:41:00,2652,"I was about 200 yards off breakwall and got about 12 perch, 2 gobies and one smallie (10"" smallie)"
722771,misfish,2012-08-15 18:43:00,29133,"Chris,you can see them from the wall. it,s crazy. Any size to the perch? Or were they dinks?"
722774,davey buoy,2012-08-15 18:52:00,5505,"We have to learn to live with it,on the upside as said on a earlier reply the bass are getting bigger!!!!"
