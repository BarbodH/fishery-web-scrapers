722563,davey buoy,2012-08-14 19:23:00,5505,"My youngest son wants to give it a go somewhere this weekend before he moves to the big smoke. You experienced guys have any idea if time of day plays a better time than any other? Personally most of my fish have been caught before noon,but many days caught nothing at all. What are your views on this?. Thanks."
722568,Locnar,2012-08-14 19:46:00,645,"I'm sorry, I can't answer those question as I have only fished for salmon once in my life, and that was downrigging with my grandpa back when I was 13. I am interested as to what might come about on this thread. Are they moving into the rivers and creeks already? What kind of lures?"
722572,davey buoy,2012-08-14 19:50:00,5505," If not now very soon,there is a thread I posted recently about every ones favorite lure. Can't be to far down the page but you should find it. Maybe last page even."
722573,misfish,2012-08-14 20:01:00,29133,"Early morning,til noon. Beers after that. Back at it again in the morning."
722576,Locnar,2012-08-14 20:07:00,645,"I just checked out the lure thread, there is quite a variety eh. I guess as everyone was saying, Salmon aren't picky. At this time of year, would they be nearer the mouths of rivers and creeks or would they have moved up already?"
722577,bassman87,2012-08-14 20:10:00,586," Tried, tested, and true."
722579,davey buoy,2012-08-14 20:16:00,5505," Could be all of the above or not. Not being difficult but you have to do some leg work and keep your ears open to what people are saying in different areas. I have found if you go to a known area a lot of people talk,than make up your own mind. That's what I do all the time and you can learn so much. Watch out for the bull:asshat:,lol. A lot of that can be heard as well. But with all this rain this past week,I'd give it a try somewhere.!!"
722581,davey buoy,2012-08-14 20:18:00,5505," I'll third that as well lol. but while I'm enjoying myself,could I be missing more?."
722585,misfish,2012-08-14 20:38:00,29133,"   Always catch,so need to go back any other time."
722586,davey buoy,2012-08-14 20:41:00,5505," Me? ,really,:rofl2:not so easy bud. lol."
722617,Canuck2fan,2012-08-14 22:39:00,1444,"All day everyday when the run is on.... I can't name an hour of the day that I haven't caught salmon.  I can however name a number of days when we caught NOTHING at any time LOL. Chrome fishing in my opinion is 100% luck of timing. You can increase your odds by doing certain things but no one I have ever met while actually fishing can guarrantee catching chrome, lots of folks talk big numbers but then didn't back it up while I watched ready to learn all about the magic of their abilities...."
722649,Richard S.,2012-08-15 00:45:00,75,Time of day isn't as important as fishing pressure. As long as your the first one in the pool and the fish aren't swimming around like their asses are on fire then there's a chance.  Rich.
722854,Paulus,2012-08-16 01:02:00,522," I have to agree. It's a big time game of timing. Best thing to do is be consistent & get out as often as you can, even if it's just for an hour or casting for 5 minutes out of the window of your car .  Night time with glow spoons off a pier can also be good.  And the big smoke probably has more salmon than you'd expect (if by ""big smoke"" you mean Toronto). There is a lot of decent chinook fishing in and around the big smoke, for sure.  p.-"
