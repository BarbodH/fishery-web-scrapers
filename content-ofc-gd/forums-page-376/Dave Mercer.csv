722370,Roy,2012-08-13 22:08:00,13728,Dave has never felt better and good for him.
722371,misfish,2012-08-13 22:27:00,29133,"I do believe,when Dave seen me go from 235,down to 175 a couple years back,and I looked so much better then him,he had no choice,but to take the Challenge.  All fun aside, it,s not easy. I bow to Dave for doing what he has done,and the weight he has lost.  It,s a lot of work,and takes commitment. Been there,done that.  Dave,,,,,,,,,,,"
722390,i2cool2fool,2012-08-13 23:59:00,349,"I am proud of Dave simply for having the focus, discipline and determination to work towards whatever his goals are. Good on him."
