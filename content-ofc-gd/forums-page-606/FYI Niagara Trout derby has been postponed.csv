524496,fishdawg,2010-12-02 04:39:00,912," thanks for your interest fishing starts at 730am for everyone, shore anglers must park at Queenston and can fish as far there legs can take them, no getting your car and driving to the whirlpool  I am not running the tournamnet, I am just a member of the club thats organizing it"
