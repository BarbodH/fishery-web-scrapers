524241,Fishnwire,2010-12-01 16:41:00,983,"I've been through this.  There are companies that sell worms on-line, mainly as pet food.  You can order large quantities from them.  Make sure its a Canadian company as there seems to be an issue with shipping live worms over the border.  I can't remember the name of the company I ordered from but the worms showed up in good shape.  They were a little expensive.  Take the time to learn about providing the right conditions to store your worms (the fridge is too cold) or they'll die real quick."
