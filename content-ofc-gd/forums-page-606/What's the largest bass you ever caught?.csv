525268,Mark,2010-12-04 13:52:00,2,My PB came this Fall on Simcoe -- a 6 lb 13 oz smallie on a minnowbait.
517175,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-03 18:00:00,0,"not sure how heavy it was (~22 inches), but i'm sure it will get bigger and bigger as i get older! "
517177,bucktail,2010-11-03 18:08:00,1857,A 23.5 inch largemouth on a chartreuse spinner bait many years ago.  Very heavy in the 7 pound range.  A 23 inch simcoe smallie that was in the high 6's.... I have the pictures around here somewhere.....  Both won me In-fisherman Master Angler for there year.

517265,Raf,2010-11-03 23:39:00,3495,stupid incidental fish hitting a muskie lure - one of the bigger ones i've caught    no idea what it weighed or its dimensions
517384,ehg,2010-11-04 13:55:00,2666,One of the bigger smallmouth i caught in Pigeon Lake.   Summer of 2009 while trying for bass.
517404,Harrison,2010-11-04 15:20:00,2202," I remember that post!  I fish Tri Lakes quite a bit and have weighed in a few nice smallies, but none over 5. That IS a trophy fish for that lake or from the other two lakes connected."
517406,Toddyc20,2010-11-04 15:29:00,141, It was between 6 and 6.5lbs caught on a black/blue tube on lake simcoe.
517412,Garry2Rs,2010-11-04 15:56:00,1425,"In my opinion it is very hard to guess the weight of large bass.  A number of years ago a friend and I won a small tournament where we had five fish that I would have sworn were all 4.5 or 5 pounds... At the weigh-in our biggest fish was under 4 pounds!  Since then I  have caught, and weighed, several LMBass in the 5 pound range.  These fish are generally about 24 inches long, and much bigger than what you often see called five pounds on TV...This one weighed 5.5  pounds and hit a generic Senko type worm on ten pound, red Powerpro, with no leader.    The largest LMBass I have caught, in season, was last Opening Day, in the rain, with Albert, aka ""HTHM.""    This fish weighed in at 7.3 pounds on a digital scale and hit a green Yum Buzz Frog, on 20 pound mono, in heavy weeds.  Here's a picture of the same fish taken as Albert lifted it out of the net.  I think the actual size is more apparent in this shot.   Garry2R's"
