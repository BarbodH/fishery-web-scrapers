522303,JustinHoffman,2010-11-22 21:31:00,482,"Hello All,  The 2010 open water season has finally come to end for me. Headed out for the final time last Tuesday (put some largies and crappie in the boat!) and now the Springbok is fast asleep until next spring. Was another good year - not so great for truly ""big"" fish, but quantity was definitely there... Was a busy summer with work, assignments and being out of commission for almost a month after appendix surgery, but fishing late into the fall sure made up for all that!  Here are a few of my more fond memories                Had a blast fishing with friends:          And of course, my Dad. Here is his PB best largie - 4.75lbs:      Had a great time doing a lodge review at Springwood Cottages on Kennebec Lake - look for the article in Ontario Out of Doors magazine this coming summer:      And shared in a great, three-day weekend at Elmhirst's Resort on Rice Lake for an OOD Writer's Retreat. Spent a day in the boat with Stephen Bates - had a blast:        And here is the last fish of 2010 - a nice chunky crappie after last light - what a great way to end the year:    Been a fun one and already looking forward to next year!
