524351,solopaddler,2010-12-01 23:19:00,8605,"Drove through rain of biblical proportions this morning. Every river, creek and ditch pure brown and churning mud.  As expected our chosen river was running high with just a tinge of colour though.  Smacked the poop out of them (all bright bullet chromers) all morning then the rain changed to snow.  More than 6"" fell in a very short time. Was a total blizzard LOL!  We poked a bunch more then packed it in, my hands couldn't take it anymore.  Despite the weather it was a great day 'till we got my Accord stuck in a snow covered pit of oozing mud LOL!  Tried to dig it out with the butt end of my snow scraper. Wasn't working too good LOL!  Finally after wallowing in the mud for an hour or so and the snow still falling hard I broke down and called a tow truck.  In 20 minutes we were out and enroute to the nearest powerwasher.  Tomorrow and Friday will be absolutely on fire, wish I could go.  So that's my story. Sorry to hijack your post Scott, but I wanted to tell the tale."

524408,bucktail,2010-12-02 00:38:00,1857,Bronte looks like an outhouse in mexico!!!
524419,irishfield,2010-12-02 01:12:00,26272,  WELL I NEVER>.....
524500,young_one,2010-12-02 04:44:00,620,"Thanks CC, saved me a trip for Thursday morning. I'll be out quite often after the 16th, my last finals. Hope to see you on the water."
524529,solopaddler,2010-12-02 12:27:00,8605,Here's where I got stuck   
524533,skeeter,2010-12-02 12:41:00,1907,you tried to dig that out with that blue snow brush???????????   to bad you dont come to the east end to fish. theres lots of OFC'rs here that would have came out to help you. of course we would reserve the right to post all the pictures of you on your knee's with the snow brush...LOL  well atleast you got out safe.
524535,solopaddler,2010-12-02 13:07:00,8605,  Yeah you can see the snow brush in the background.  There was some pretty choice commentary while I was digging let me tell ya.
524546,johnnyb,2010-12-02 13:58:00,3413," I'm sure you meant pics of him down on his knees digging...but all I could think of was him doing the ""Solo pose"" with the scraper, instead of a fish  And yeah...I'll bet there were some choice words...I hope this doesn't mean you got rid of the X-Trail?"
524548,Fish4Eyes,2010-12-02 14:01:00,1022,"Not sure how good your tires are, but the Icelander secret to get out of snow is to deflate your tires a bit to provide more traction."
524553,solopaddler,2010-12-02 14:23:00,8605," Smart   It was the first trip the entire fall I didn't drive the truck, go figure.     Ummmm....yeah. No way I was going to that in a mud pit with a front wheel drive sedan.  Seriously I wasted a lot of time digging with the ice scraper and getting pretty frustrated.  Tow truck guy was there 15 mins after I called and only charged 20 bucks."
524559,Garnet,2010-12-02 14:43:00,2056,Open the hood and get somebody sitting on that flat spot. Get weight on tires and it will walk out.
524562,solopaddler,2010-12-02 14:49:00,8605, That makes total sense.
524567,canadadude,2010-12-02 15:02:00,769,"20 bucks and alittle muck, small price to pay for a good day on the water"
