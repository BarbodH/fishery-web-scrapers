520059,msp,2010-11-15 02:42:00,1336,Fall fishing this year has been great. Mostly targeting largies. Enjoy the pics.  Thanksgining weekend with the old man and the kid.....    Fall pike.... Twins    Noverber Largies......      Smoked my personal best largie with this 6 lb 6oz bucket......   Had my son out this weekend and we both did pretty good. He's catching them on his own now. He got his first pike today. Hours of entertainment in the live well for him. A crappie surprise !      Hopefully a couple more trips on the boat this year and I will keep you guys posted.

524110,msp,2010-12-01 01:49:00,1336,"Just an update from my favorite fishing month of the year. A couple of steelhead days provided double digit days. White knuckle driving in a snowstorm to my favorite pike lake last weekend got us some respectable fish for the last ""up North"" trip this season. There still may be a few trips before Christmas. I will keep you guys posted. enjoy the pics.     "
