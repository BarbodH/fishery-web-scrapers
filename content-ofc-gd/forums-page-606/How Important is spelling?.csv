524662,Grimace,2010-12-02 18:49:00,2020,Me too.  Incredible how easy it was.  I do believe we should do a better job of preserving the language. Some of the kids on the internet make English much like Newspeak.
524663,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-02 18:49:00,2690," I can read it no problem, as well...but, it drives me crazy, how in the modern era of texting (which personally I don't think anyone over the age of 18 should be doing) the english language is going to ""hell in a handbag""."
524664,misfish,2010-12-02 18:53:00,29133,I could read that easier then if it was spelt correct.

524679,tb4me,2010-12-02 19:15:00,3295,Actually Im all for a change in the English language. Its long overdue. websters has been around sine the late 1800's I belive. The way we spell some things goes way beyond be. There was a great thing on am640 about this issue not to long ago..wish i could find the link..Its a good listen.

This is all I could find,,Its gone off the audio on demand. 10:30 shrtng englsh lang Four peaceful protesters stood outside the Grand Hyatt on Thursday, where the Scripps National Spelling Bee is under way. The group is campaigning to simplify the way the English language is spelled. They think ""fruit"" should be spelled f-r-o-o-t and the silent ""w"" would be dropped from the end of ""slow."" Eighty-one-year-old Roberta Mahoney braved the 90-plus degree midday heat in a full-length bee costume to lead the protest. She said the complexity of the English language keeps 40 percent of the population from learning how to read, write and spell. Are they right?"

524710,Grimace,2010-12-02 20:15:00,2020,I am sorry but I think that is embarrassing.  To suggest the general populace lacks the intelligence to comprehend the basics of English is ludacris.
524712,Grimace,2010-12-02 20:16:00,2020,"How would you go about spelling ""fruition""?"

524800,JohnF,2010-12-03 00:12:00,3494," How would you feel if the safety instructions for your airplane already sinking were written this way?  Or how would you view a job application for a secretarial position if the applicant spelled this way?  What if your oncologist took the casual approach to spelling as he set up your chemo orders for all those wild and crazy meds they mix? The chemical names look misspelled even when they're correct.  I hate spell checkers that insist on changing my words from proper Canadian to American style spelling. Not that there's anything wrong with spelling the words that way when you're American but when in Canada .... Etc.  The problem is the slippery slope syndrome. When does letting poor spelling skills slide in school extend to poor math skills, or science skills, etc.  As you've probably figured out I'm a tad obsessive about spelling. I wouldn't hire the secretarial job applicant who showed me she/he couldn't or wouldn't take the trouble to be accurate with his/her word work. The product is how people judge my whole company and I'd rather we weren't seen as only marginally literate.  Call it snotty or obsessive, whatever you want, but I know I don't stand alone. And yes, I know the odd one sneaks through on me, partly because I often turn off spellcheckers, and sometimes because I don't.  Respectfully JF"
