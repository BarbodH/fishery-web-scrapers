I know there is lakers, but I've read conflicting reports about the presence of pike and grayling.  Any info is appreciated, and feel free to recommend other lakes in the area."
524737,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-02 21:39:00,10439,I haven't fished it but it's far enough South that I would bet that the pike grow big in there. I would also bet there is good fishing for burbot and whitefish. There are probably big lakers in that lake as well.  It looks to be a resevoir too. Here's depth charts of the lake.  Here's a topo map of the area.  Here's a link to the Yukon's fishing reg's too.  I would say there is a good chance that this lake would make an awesome vacation.

The concern with the pike is that some sources (Guides, Outfitters) claim that there's pike there, while one park report was adamant that there is not suitable pike habitat and their population is therefore extremely low.
