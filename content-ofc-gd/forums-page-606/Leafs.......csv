Next weeks HNIC is Montreal again, so that might be 1 point as it's usually good for overtime, but this years Leafs not likely.  That week is all Canada teams, Montreal, Edmonton, Calgary, Vanoouver.  I think the Leafs will be 2nd last in the league and out of the playoffs by Xmas!!!!!!!  Lottery pick for Boston.....most likely!!!!!!!!"
