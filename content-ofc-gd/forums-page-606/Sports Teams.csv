524720,jedimaster,2010-12-02 20:37:00,3472,"Just wondering what you guys would consider ""Good enough"". A perenial playoff contender, with a championship every 10 years? A team thats up and down misses the playoffs but wins a championship once every 10 years?  Wins a few championships every 10 years.  Never misses the playoffs, but doesn't seem to be able to seal the deal in the playoffs..   What would you be happy with?  I would consider a successful franchise. 1) Finishes above .500 every year, below 500 means dismal failure and changes need to be made. 2) Doesn't just sneak into the playoffs every year but is considered to have a good chance at winning a playoff round every year. 3) I am not so hung up on winning a championship, but I would like for them to at least contend to win a championship once every 10 years.  That I would be happy with, for Baseball, Hockey, Football whatever.   EDIT  I would also like my teams to always have one star player I can truley root for."
