524764,camillj,2010-12-02 22:41:00,1988,"Well Roy ....All I gots ta say is this ....  When I was a kid (the best darn road hockey warrior in Scarboro if I dont say so myself ...even when I watched Greztky playing in the minors against my good friends from L'Amoureaux ....I always new one day I would turn on 'Hockey night in Canada' and hear .... ""Camilleri .. shoooots he scooooooooooores .... I just never knew they would spell it wrong ... but when you close your eyes it still sound perrrrrrfect !"
524784,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 23:43:00,5865,It looks more and more like the Sabres will soon have the richest owner in the league that wants to spend more money than God has to bring the cup to Buffalo....
523239,Billy Bob,2010-11-27 14:43:00,5865,Our Sabres almost shut out the dead Maple Leafs yesterday....  Nothing like starting crap with my Canadian friends....damn I wish you guys had your football team....now that would be fun bantering.  NICE..........http://sports.yahoo.com/video/player/feat/NHL_Highlights/23219294;_ylt=AlcR88OnKCzgiaS.7r8cGjp7vLYF  Again NICE....http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2010112602  Montreal........YOUR NEXT.....

523244,Roy,2010-11-27 14:56:00,13728," Could very well be, Billy Bob. We're just dithering on the edge of mediocrity here."
523245,Billy Bob,2010-11-27 15:04:00,5865,I'm just having a little fun....I'm not even a big hockey fan....but if I can rub it in.....
523246,Roy,2010-11-27 15:07:00,13728," Yeah, that's what she said at the Bell Canada picnic...."
523379,mercman,2010-11-27 23:55:00,7054,"  Funny, but from your photo you look like a guy who has played alot of hockey.!! Ya have tha athletic profile."
523409,Billy Bob,2010-11-28 02:11:00,5865, Actually I played a lot of football and some baseball. My son Billy played college football (middle linebacker like his dad) and even coach college football for a couple of years. Hockey not considered a major sport down here.
523410,irishfield,2010-11-28 02:13:00,26272,It's not considered a viable sport in Toronto either Bob !!
523432,Twocoda,2010-11-28 04:10:00,4130,seems to be an appropriate time to remind Billy Bob of the most recent WINTER OLYMPICS!!!!!!!!
523433,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-28 04:15:00,4399,Well Billy Bob I must say your Sabres looked like   tonite!!!  No comment on the team from Toronto!!!
523457,Billy Bob,2010-11-28 12:49:00,5865, Did we win....I didn't even watch the game....Remember the Titans was on...much better to watch than hockey...
523515,misfish,2010-11-28 20:05:00,29133, Great movie BB.Watched it aswell.
523905,lunkerbasshunter,2010-11-30 13:12:00,2585,"hey billybob,  Once the old man dies in buffalo toronto will get its nfl team.  Then you will have to trek across the border to watch your bills lose.  Cheers!"
523908,blaque,2010-11-30 13:30:00,2419, Hockey is the ONLY sport around here for the last 10 years.
523967,misfish,2010-11-30 16:48:00,29133,"Co-worker here took his 12 year old son to the Bills/Pits game. Said the game was good to watch,the fans however,rude and drunk.He was thankful that they stop serving beer after the first half.Also thankfull for the many policemen that were present. MAN,WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS DONE DOWN THERE.I use to enjoy heading south of the boarder to watch the game. MAYBE IT WAS JUST A BAD DAY. After the game,he was told there was a kids section, where there is no booze allowed."
523974,Billy Bob,2010-11-30 17:09:00,5865, It's been reported nearly 1/3 of the ticket buyers are Canadians.....they like to party....until someone gets hurt it's OK with me....I stopped going to the Bills games over 10 years ago....I use to take the family....now it's too expensive for my budget...parking is $25 per car.....friggin game is on TV...not to mention many better games on TV at times.
523976,Billy Bob,2010-11-30 17:11:00,5865, I WISH but it will never happen....I will NEVER head to Toronto to watch even the Super Bowl if Toronto ever did get it...
523979,Headhunter,2010-11-30 17:26:00,5703,"Come on BB, I know we allow banjo's across the border! And after the game, Rice Lake is only an hour away! HH"
524000,Billy Bob,2010-11-30 18:59:00,5865, We have TONS of Bluegills down here....bigger and better bluegills...

524187,Headhunter,2010-12-01 13:34:00,5703,"Ok... Mom raised a tall boy, not a bright one... what the heck does that mean!? HH"

524293,Headhunter,2010-12-01 19:49:00,5703,"Well BB, based on what I read and the musings of a co-worker, we're having dinner at 6:30am!!!! I'm all for being different, just ask anyone who has met me, but I don't think I'm working the graveyard shift, so that would mean breakfast to me! And that would mean you're going to have to get up really early to have it on the plate on time! LOL HH Edit*** and who you calling ""young""!"
524356,Billy Bob,2010-12-01 23:28:00,5865, Well today with a bit of shoveling and tree shaking I feel like  85 but I'm only 55.....so I'm calling you young.
