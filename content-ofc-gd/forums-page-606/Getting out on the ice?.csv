524308,Rod Caster,2010-12-01 20:30:00,5784,  I would never take a BMW out on the ice. My Toyota however  I'll usually wait till I've seen lots of traffic on the ice before I take my vehicle out...and only on the main routes...then again i can't venture too far in a Corolla.
524314,Bernie,2010-12-01 21:33:00,3190,"12 inches is lots of ice to drive on. However....it may be good at one area you check but areas where current persists there may only be an inch or two. This is where vehicles go through. Know the lake, talk to locals guys that know these areas first. Travel on known routes, don't go if you don't know."
524328,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-01 22:09:00,203,"One of these usually work       Man, I'm getting excited the more everyone keeps talking about it"
524329,Rod Caster,2010-12-01 22:13:00,5784, Apparently two works even better. Nice machines.
524333,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-01 22:36:00,203,  Thanks   And yes they're a lot of fun. I use the polaris pretty much all year round. Have only gotten her stuck a few times in deep snow & had to use the winch
524359,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-12-01 23:30:00,1362,"I've been able to get out to most lakes the past couple of years with this setup...if the snow is too deep for the bike, I have an old 91 Polaris 500 Classic that gets me around...  "
524492,NAW,2010-12-02 04:23:00,4022,"Here's my beast.  250 Bravo.  I have a big homemade flip up hut, but don't use it very often.  I like to be out in the open.  Cold wind in the face is refreshing! "
523990,Keenan,2010-11-30 18:29:00,59,Which mode of transportation do you guys and gals use to get out to the hut?
523992,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-30 18:40:00,2690,These boots were made for walking....... ATV or sled are not in the budget.
523993,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-30 18:41:00,0,"  I don't use a Hut. We walk to where the fish are.  On Simcoe, if yer not on fish after 15 mins..you move and keep moving till you find them. Keeps ya warm and in shape(  )and puts fish through the hole every time."
524004,Smarty Pantz,2010-11-30 19:09:00,203,"Once the ice is frozen enough, it's usually in the truck or car & sometimes the atv   This year, think I'm going to break out the cross country skiis"

524023,skeeter,2010-11-30 20:02:00,1907,"Hey Terry, that is one sweet set up you have!!!!!!!!  as for me i use    it ia a lot cheaper then having a vehicle go thru the ice. and if it ever did, i will still have my ride home from the lake..."
524043,beginner,2010-11-30 21:01:00,542,"wow thats a nice ride and good hut.. as for me I walk and walk.. make hole and fish.. if theres no fish u move on.. till you get tired! lol  last year was my first ice fishing and I had no idea what Im doing.. just a beginner  funny or stupid story is when I was at simcoe in jackson point last year.. after I finished fishing for perch I decided to fish for lake trout and white fish.. I was walking and walking for about aleast 50 to 60mins because I wanted to go far and thought going to far makes the water level deep but it end up same water level.. from where I was before to where I am..  and still perch.. omg that is very tiring.. expect for something different, it ends to the same fish  the lesson I've learned is that find the water structure of the lake.. So that I know where to go next time"
524046,irishfield,2010-11-30 21:05:00,26272,Can't beat a chart.. that's for sure. You don't have to go far from shore on Simcoe to get into 100FOW.  This is my ice fishing rig.. with Lloyd driving it!

524069,Terry,2010-11-30 22:17:00,14456, you let Lloyd drive it....better check the bogie wheels    I'm just saying
524075,Jer,2010-11-30 23:03:00,1426,Once the ice is safe...  ...ya gotta travel in comfort...  
524080,GBW,2010-11-30 23:37:00,8460,"where is that pic someone had about ice thickness and what is considered safe?  like, walking, sled/atv, car then truck, you know the one...  I walk most times but when the ice is nice and safe I take my AWD car out.  depends where I am too."
524082,GBW,2010-11-30 23:40:00,8460,"oh and a float suit is a must!  Even if you use snowpants and a floater jacket, they need help to find the body you know if you go out and it's far from safe..."
524083,Nipfisher,2010-11-30 23:45:00,2449," Sled or quad until there is 10"" of ice   ***Just realized I no longer have any pics of my sled on this computer, but it is a 1993 Skandic 503R all done up for ice fishing.***  then out in the truck.  "
524085,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-30 23:51:00,10439,It depends when and where I'm fishing. Early in the season I'm on foot. If I'm fishing where there is little snow I take this.    And for the rest of my fishing I use this little fella.  
524088,Governator,2010-12-01 00:00:00,879,"I know everyone here is a lot more experienced than I am, especially when it comes to hardwater but I just can't imagine bringing my vehicle on the ice regardless of thickness.  Every year I see pictures posted of cars underwater, trucks half under, etc.  It's one thing if it's a 1980 piece of junk (Even then I wouldn't want to risk the cost of getting it out) but it's another when it's your family vehicle.  I just can't wrap my ahead around it especially if you own a snowmobile or atv anyway.  Personally I think the risk faaaaaaaaar outweighs the reward of quick travel.  Am I alone on this or those who do bring the vehicle out there have you ever had any close calls?"
524089,irishfield,2010-12-01 00:04:00,26272,A way of life for some and a serious fear for others..  Me I like parking at my DOCK. lol
524091,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-01 00:06:00,10439," If I still lived in Ontario I would totally agree with you,  but they drive tractor trailers on the ice up in these parts. That shot above of my Honda on the ice is about 70kms from town and the ice was almost 4 feet thick in mid January. I have drilled through almost 5 1/2 feet of ice late in the season. You can land a fully loaded 747 on that much ice. I'm not worried about my light duty SUV."
524095,GBW,2010-12-01 00:20:00,8460,"The best thing anyone can do that doesn't know a lake can get a depth chart.  Find out where rivers come in and go out.  That is where the ice is going to be thin at all times.  My lake has an underwater river about mid way down the lake, I would never take my car out there...  Scugog, I'm ok with taking my 2006 out there after the new year and I've tested many an area on the ice by foot.  I would not go up to the far North end of Scugog in my car, sled yes but I don't have one..."
524105,Fisherman,2010-12-01 01:34:00,7201,Might not be fast but it floats. 
524115,Bernie,2010-12-01 02:03:00,3190,"About 4 winters ago I moved a boathouse across the lake to my island cottage. This was done on 16"" of blue ice. The boat house is 18'x25'    "
524167,Rich,2010-12-01 10:35:00,3927,On foot! Keep moving! Can't bring myself to sit in a hut for more than 5 minutes even if there's fish in there.

524300,Keenan,2010-12-01 20:04:00,59,So how much ice do you guys consider enough before you chance taking your cars and trucks out there?
