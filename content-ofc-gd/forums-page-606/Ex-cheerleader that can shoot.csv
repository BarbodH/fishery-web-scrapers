These are the longest recorded and confirmed sniper kills in history.[21][22][23][24]  Canadian Corporal Rob Furlong, formerly of the PPCLI (Operation Anaconda, Afghanistan) - achieved a recorded and confirmed sniper kill at 2,430 m (2,657 yd) in 2002 using a .50 caliber (12.7 mm) McMillan TAC-50 rifle.[59]  Canadian Master Corporal Arron Perry, formerly of the PPCLI (Operation Anaconda, Afghanistan) - briefly held the record for the longest-ever recorded and confirmed sniper kill at 2,310 m (2,526 yd) in 2002 after eclipsing US Marine Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock's previous record established in 1967. Perry used a .50 caliber (12.7 mm) McMillan TAC-50 rifle.[59]"

524978,John,2010-12-03 16:18:00,2956," Will this do....   The word itself is from the Greek metron (μετρον), ""a measure"" via the French mètre. Its first recorded usage in English is from 1797.  In the eighteenth century, there were two favoured approaches to the definition of the standard unit of length. One suggested defining the metre as the length of a pendulum with a half-period of one second. The other suggested defining the metre as one ten-millionth of the length of the earth's meridian along a quadrant (one-fourth the polar circumference of the earth). In 1791, the French Academy of Sciences selected the meridional definition, using the meridian of Paris, over the pendular definition because of the slight variation of the force of gravity over the surface of the earth, which affects the period of a pendulum. In August1793, the Republican Government in France decreed that the standard unit of length would be 10exp-7 of the earth's quadrant passing through Paris and that the unit be called the metre. Five years later the survey of the arc was completed and three platinum standards and several iron copies were made. Subsequent analysis showed that the length of the earth's quadrant had been incorrectly surveyed resulting in the first prototype metre bar being short by a fifth of a millimetre (due to miscalculation of the flattening of the earth), instead of altering the length of the metre to maintain the 10exp-7 ratio, the metre was redefined as the distance between two marks on a bar. So, the circumference of the Earth through the poles is only approximately forty million metres.  In the 1870s and in light of modern precision, a series of international conferences were held to devise new metric standards. The Treaty of the Metre (1875) mandated the establishment of a permanent International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM: Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) to be located in Sèvres, France. This new organization would preserve the new prototype metre and kilogram when constructed, and would maintain comparisons between them and the basic units of other, nonmetric, weights and measures. This organisation created a new prototype bar in 1889, establishing the International Prototype Metre as the distance between two lines on a standard bar of an alloy of ninety percent platinum and ten percent iridium.  In 1893, the standard metre was first measured with an interferometer by Albert A. Michelson, the inventor of the device and an advocate of using some particular wavelength of light as a standard of distance. By 1925, interferometry was in regular use at the BIPM. However, the International Prototype Metre remained the standard until 1960, when the eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM: Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures) defined the metre in the new SI system as equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum.  To further reduce uncertainty, the seventeenth CGPM of 1983 replaced the definition of the metre with its current definition, thus fixing the length of the metre in terms of time and the speed of light:"

This 19 year old ex-cheerleader now an Air Force Security Forces Sniper, was watching a road that led to a NATO military base when she observed a man digging by the road. She engaged the target (she shot him).  It turned out he was a bomb maker for the Taliban, and he was burying an IED that was to be detonated when a US patrol walked by 30 minutes later.  It would have certainly killed and wounded several soldiers. The interesting fact of this story is the shot was measured at 725 yards. She shot him as he was bent over burying the bomb. The shot went through his butt and into the bomb which detonated; he was blown to pieces.  The Air Force made a motivational poster of her. (Folks, that's a shot 25 yards longer than seven football fields - about 7/10 of a mile) And the last thing that came out of his mouth ..  was his ass!
