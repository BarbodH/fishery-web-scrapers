524588,John,2010-12-02 16:03:00,2956,"Benson was a typical lab, missing a gene that told him when he was full! He lived to eat but for most of his life we managed to keep his weight under control. Well, probably the funniest two, both involved food of course....one when he met the pizza delivery boy at the front door, pizza boy dropped the pizza, Ben grabbed the pizza and it was gone in 30 seconds.................and yes, I paid for it, including tip. The other was when we left a dozen large kaiser rolls on the kitchen counter and went out for a while. When we returned the empty plastic bag was on the kitchen floor, with a less than 2"" diameter hole in one corner. He had pulled them out one by one out of that hole! He was OK until he decided he was thirsty and drank his full bowl of water, you could see his abdomen expand by the minute. Took him two days recover from that one...  Still think about him every day..."
524590,SmokestackLightnin,2010-12-02 16:10:00,390,"I have a 6-year old Labradoodle and she is the biggest pain in the butt when fishing.  About 2 years ago while fishing on Lake Temagami I thought maybe I should just put a fish in the livewell and let her watch it.  So a dink smallmouth goes into the well and she is content laying on the back casting deck watching this fish in the well.  The next thing I know she back at the front of the boat with me and this time she's really content because she's holding the fish in her mouth.  The other crazy habit that she has is taking chickens for a run around my property.  I live on a farm just north of Barrie and when we first bought we thought it would nice to have a half dozen or so laying hens.  We had typical 'Green Acres"" like visions of hens walking around the barn clucking away and fresh eggs for breakfast.   Apparentely chickens and bird dogs don't mix....who knew?  The first time it happened I hear my son who was 6 at the time freaking out by the barn, I was in my office which looks the opposite way.  The next thing I see is this chocalate Labradoodle running by my window with an excited Brown Leghorn in her mouth.  3 circles around the property and that chicken was ready for the soup pot and I was on my way to build a fenced in run around the chicken coop we just put up."

I think he humped every inch of both legs before she finally decided to leave while she could.I was laffing so hard i almost soiled myself.He never did it to anyone before or after this one woman.I asked what perfume it was, but her friend just gave me a drop dead look, as she left the house."

My neighbors shoot groundhogs in their yard, but they are rather rotund, so they don`t approach the idea of picking up the dead carcasses with the same vigor. Well old Shadow liked to explore and bring home treasures, one day he came back from exploring with what looked like a piece of hairy beef jerky as big as a dinner plate. he though he was bringing the groundhog jerky in the house.  Kids took Mr. Shadow for a walk to the store on the traffic circle a mile away (on a (leash), bad plan, he learned of new places to explore. Being the social butterfly that he was if no one was outside around the yard he would go up there on his own looking for some one to play with. So we would get calls, your dog is back here again.  He would get in the car with anyone that offered to take him for a ride, even if the offer wasn`t made vocally, he was fast enough to get into the car, truck, van before you could if you opened the door. Stranger? if you are taking me for a ride you are not a stranger! you are my new friend!  Him and my long time fishing buddy 2 doors down dog where buddies, another lab. Shadow had a sixth sense about him, Buster just got a bath, time to get him and go play in the mud, wander the creek bed, can`t have him wandering around clean!  In his younger days we spoiled him, after Christmas dinner he got the ham bone, bad move, he became a ham bone junkie, no neighbors trash was safe! If they were having ham? he went looking for the bone! and he could knock over a trash can!  Nothing major, a good dog and a missed friend."

I heard a strange noise coming from the entrance and I found her trying to shake it loose from her upper lip!!!  Took that one off myself without too much trouble.  She did eat a shinner left on a little hook one spring whilst fishing for ice out whities and had to be taken to the vet to have it removed from her throat.  I could feel the hook and so could the vet but it was impossible to get it out because the urge to swallow was too overpowering.  The vet had me hold her down while he tried to anesthetize her and after he had inserted the tube, realized that it was too small and had to pull it out.  I saw a bit of blood on the tube and I passed out right there in the operating room!!  When I came to she was drooping drunk and behind bars, but he had gotten the hook out..  Then there was the incident with a skunk..  I came home from the bar at 3am and she wanted out, and I didn't think to tie her up cause I was loopy drunk...  She bust out the door and went straight for a skunk on the deck!  I wasn't about to clean her in my condition so I figured I'd keep her in the shop until the morning.  What I didn't realise was that the door leading to the house was ajar and she went straight for momy and daddys bed...  I can still hear the shriek.  Quite possibly the worst night of my life.  She never did learn though..  Skunks, porcupines, rolling around in carrion and other people's turds, lip smacking outhouse binges, etc..  Stupidest pooch we've ever had.  Pretty safe to say that in-breeding was the culprit.  Still, best dog ever!!  RIP Maxime.  Wish I had a pic.  cheers HD"

So bad in fact that the surgeon said it had exploded.  Fortunately it happened about 20 yards or so from an emergency phone so I was able to slowly crawl over to it.

After I let him, he came out covered in crap...seems someone tossed a dirty diaper under the bushes and he relished rolling on it...Papers on the back seat with me holding him on them, Maribeth drove us home and straight into a kiddies pool we had for him in the back yard...  He did the same down at Rice Lake and after we cleaned him up in the creek with laundry soap, I doused him with ""Brute"" aftershave...my sis-in-law said he smelled like a teen aged boy...  Shortly after we moved up here (Pigeon Lake) he took off exploring the neighborhood...we got a call from the local dog catcher...seems he jumped in the station wagon and sat on the passenger seat keeping him company...It still cost me $20 after they dropped him off for the sightseeing taxi ride...

With out thinking, I loaded the sucker up and let one fly.  Remmy was his name. He thought I had knocked down a potatoe duck half way across the lake when he saw the splash.  Off he went.  I jumped in the boat, chased him, but he wouldn't come to the boat until he had the tater.  I had to go back to the site, get his duck sock fly back out to him before he would give up the hunt.  He slept like a baby that night. Man I miss him. Great dog.  Our family dog growing up was an irish setter/golden retriever mix named Copper.  Beautiful dog.  One X-mas eve we had family over and my Dad(after quite a few pops) thought he would show all the kids our new budgie, Freddy.  As 10 or so kids sat around excited to pat freddy the bird, my Dad opens up the cage.  The Dog was lying on the floor under the cage and to the SHOCK and AWE of the kiddies the bird only got 6 inches out of the cage and Bang.  Copper had'em. Til this day we still laugh about it...bird was fine after a $1100 bill from the vet...$1100! My Mom and sis would not let freddy go.  What are budgies nowadays?  Guesstimate $50?  Maybe not the dumbest dog stories, moreso the owners."
