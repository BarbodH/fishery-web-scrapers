This lake is close to me (orangeville)and if anyone has any experience on the ice there I'd like to know more about it, thanks!"

524335,misfish,2010-12-01 22:54:00,29133, Good sound advice.   You can fish some areas and catch perch (wormy perch) Move on and try other lakes that are near by.You be much happier.

I suspect that the fishing in Lake Eugenia is not quite as good as it apparently was over a hundred years ago."
