524322,mike rousseau,2010-12-01 21:53:00,4661,for supper?...im having fresh walleye...mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
524324,mercman,2010-12-01 22:03:00,7054,"  nice guy...... I'm having KD and tuna, ya wanna taste ???"
524325,mike rousseau,2010-12-01 22:05:00,4661,i manufacture kd...lol...really
524332,Roy,2010-12-01 22:35:00,13728," Buy more shares and crank up the production line, Mike. KD cooked al dente will become the next best selling flossing ""bait"". And you can take that to the bank. If you can get a line up with fluorescent colours, you'll get the kids' lunches AND the salmon and steelheader dudes."
524352,mike rousseau,2010-12-01 23:22:00,4661, bravo...

524544,Roy,2010-12-02 13:47:00,13728," SHSHHHH, we're creating a diversion."
524906,mike rousseau,2010-12-03 11:50:00,4661, ...good idea...i meant to say that these beasts were from BOQ...st.lawrence doesnt have fish like this

524217,Headhunter,2010-12-01 15:22:00,5703,Very nice!!!!! HH
524222,ehg,2010-12-01 15:29:00,2666,"You don't need to go to Quinte when the big walleyes are there.  I remember going to Summerstown a decade or so ago, hoping for those fish, all we caught were pike  Excellent fish and report."
524225,mike rousseau,2010-12-01 15:31:00,4661,we are ver close to that area
524228,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-01 15:45:00,3761,"Great catches man, look up photobucket. Much easier way to upload pictures and you can get them all on 1 post.  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
524230,Rod Caster,2010-12-01 15:50:00,5784,WOW nice fish! That'll rival BOQ anyday.
524238,mike rousseau,2010-12-01 16:17:00,4661,i dont have the pic but my brother got a 13 pounder a two weeks ago!
524248,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-01 16:48:00,0,"rather see the 55"" than the bait....."
524249,Terry,2010-12-01 16:50:00,14456,"great fish  and now that people know, maybe it will take some pressure off BOQ walleye...LOL"
524250,mike rousseau,2010-12-01 16:50:00,4661,it was in muskyhunter mag last year...he actually recaptured the same fish...first in the summer when she was thin then again in the fall when she was a lot fatter
524252,mike rousseau,2010-12-01 16:53:00,4661,probably not... we dont have the numbers to support 50 boats in a 5 km stretch
524253,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-01 16:53:00,0,  its no wonder I havent seen it  ....I take it you dont have the pictures to show then?
524254,mike rousseau,2010-12-01 16:56:00,4661,nope... i'll try to get em for ya
