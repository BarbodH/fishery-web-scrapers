524617,misfish,2010-12-02 16:54:00,29133, Ya think. Look at the price of your tickets. Then look what they tried to scab us at. Thats not how you get support.
524691,jbailey,2010-12-02 19:42:00,866,the house fires hahah watching fox news it was always house fires in north tonawanda... and those ads for Celino and Barnes  apparently they broke up for a bit but are back together haha
524695,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 19:46:00,5865, We don't have a Fox news station here......better get your story straight first...then you can make up things as you wish....
524699,ctranter,2010-12-02 19:52:00,543,"Here's Buffalo right here:  http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/81205047/  I say we trade the raptors to buffalo for Toronto's 2nd NHL franchise.  I always wondered how people could afford to go to sports games in Buffalo, what with the extreme poverty and all."
524703,tb4me,2010-12-02 20:03:00,3295,That vid was amazing.it was almost like they were giving away the crap. Dont see that stuff round here..
524810,JohnF,2010-12-03 00:43:00,3494," 8)  Love it.  I'm one proud Canuck who likes lots of things American. That's not to say I'd be in a hurry to leave my quiet little northern town to live in the US but there are certainly lots of places I enjoy visiting south of the border. I probably cross the border close to every month or two, seldom on business. I admit that on occasion I may have even been heard to mutter ""I could live here.""  It's pretty hard to completely ignore the influence of next door neighbours (there's a spellchecker freeby for y'all) who as individuals are virtually indistinguishable from us save for regional accents. After all, Americans outnumber us 10 to 1 so there's bound to be influence.  Again, no intent to offend  JF"
524818,Pigeontroller,2010-12-03 01:12:00,2793,"Oh I like Americans, plenty of them are my friends...Just not jealous of them...22 million illegals mostly from your southern border makes us jealous how??? Cause you gots lots of good gardeners???"
524831,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-03 01:48:00,0," Must....not ....reply....too late!  Well after NAFTA raped Mexico of its resources and the only good job in Mexico now is smuggling cocaine to the America crack heads? No wonder they are trying to leave Mexico......  If the leafs keep playing like this and leaf fans stop watching hockey? Both Ottawa and Buffalo will fold in a few years, regardless of who owns them.  The first thing he should do is change their Jerseys. Buffalo has one of the ugliest Jerseys. Enlarge the Old Sabre Logo!  By the way. How you liking the snow?lol  Ok. Now you can lock it up.LOL"
524839,daryl0815,2010-12-03 01:52:00,225,"lol this place gets nasty pretty quick!  One thing I dont understand is, with a salary cap system, what difference does it make who owns the team? you can only spend x amount of money"
524840,misfish,2010-12-03 01:52:00,29133,"  Took you long enough to reply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
524855,Rod Caster,2010-12-03 02:13:00,5784," Salary cap is a small part of it....but some teams don't spend the full cap to save money, such as the cheap   Phoenix Coyotes. Perks and good management is what really makes a good team.... such as playing under Scotty Bowman or Kenny Holland. Ask Marian Hossa (if you happen to know him personally) he knows where to play...it isn't always about the salary. Good ownership will create good management; good management will create good teams."
524903,Billy Bob,2010-12-03 11:29:00,5865,"Right now we have a out of town owner who doesn't care about hockey...but we are Thankful that he saved our Sabres when he did purchase them about 8 years ago...but now it looks like that page is about to turn and all you Leafs fans can come down and watch your butts get kick while spend enormous amounts of money down here.....  (remember guys, this is all in good fun and most get that here, but some guys are slower then others...dont' want to name names, right Johnny Bass....  )"
524941,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-03 14:24:00,0," Hey, I'm having fun too."
524394,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 00:06:00,5865,Need your experienced input here on the sale of the Sabres.....I think it will be the best thing that has happened to the Sabres in over 20 years.  Remember....I'm a Redneck football/baseball fan and don't know squat about hockey other then the Sabres are better then the Wilting Leafs...    ...LOL  Bob
524396,Roy,2010-12-02 00:09:00,13728,Who's buying them? Walmart?
524398,misfish,2010-12-02 00:11:00,29133, NAWWWW Tim Hortons.Friggen trader.LOL
524401,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 00:21:00,5865, Walmart might be the only one that has more money than BILLIONAIRE Terry Pegula.......this guy LOVE HOCKEY.....  http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/sabres-nhl/inside-the-nhl/article269124.ece  http://blogs.buffalonews.com/sabres/2010/12/sabres-price-tag-175-million.html  My dear Canadian friends......don't be jealous....be happy for us....  BTW the other rumor IF true is that Tom Golisano is going to take the proceeds to put towards the Buffalo Bills purchase......
524524,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 12:09:00,5865,"WOW, looks like you guys are in shock !  !  !"
524556,canadadude,2010-12-02 14:37:00,769,hahahahahahah......and there building a Bass Pro shop in Buffalo aswell
524560,Mike Pike,2010-12-02 14:45:00,1332,"The Bass Pro Shop ain't gonna happen now, Dude.  ...oh wait, I just got it.  Good one."
524561,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 14:47:00,5865," Remember my jealous Canadian friends.....""He who laughs last, laughs BEST""..."
524564,Rod Caster,2010-12-02 14:51:00,5784,"  So shocked about this I almost fell asleep. Guaranteed the Sabres win the cup this year Maybe the new owners will build a fence to keep all the leafs fans out.  Where is our GD Hamilton team, or Winnipeg team? Cmon Coyotes, move north and rename yourselves the Hamilton Steelhead."
524565,Pigeontroller,2010-12-02 14:52:00,2793,"Bill, what you gotta come to realize is...There are no Canadians that are jealous of Americans."
524566,canadadude,2010-12-02 14:59:00,769,"New owners, welcome to the NHL the Winnipeg Sabers hahahahahahahahaha"
524569,tipupesox,2010-12-02 15:16:00,167,"Being a local boy, I think it will be a great miove if the deal goes through.  Sounds like the guy is a true fan of the game and wants to produce a winner.  On the Bills front, since Rogers Communications is looking at purchasing Maple Leafs Entertainment, a good chunk of there collateral will be tied up.  Doubt if they will have the revenus to support the Bills as well.  Also heard this morning that the proposed purchaser of the Sabres may have interest in purchasing the Bills."
524571,canadadude,2010-12-02 15:18:00,769,Welcome to the NFL the Toronto Bills hahahahahahahaha
524573,Governator,2010-12-02 15:25:00,879,  Better by what standard?  They both are equally terrible on the ice.
524575,bassman,2010-12-02 15:30:00,384,"I'm a Leaf fan, and yes they've got issues, but at least I don't live in the armpit of America.  BTW, have they ever fixed the fire problems in Cheektowaga, or was it Tonawanda, maybe Lackawanna."
524582,blaque,2010-12-02 15:40:00,2419,"Such a proud day for the OFC ""community"""
524599,Whopper,2010-12-02 16:30:00,2174,  LOL that's what happens when you poke things with a stick
524603,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 16:32:00,5865," See, now there's where you are wrong...22 million illegal aliens can't be wrong...."
524604,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 16:34:00,5865, At the present time you are correct...BUT.....with a new hockey loving owner all bets are off the ice...
524606,canadadude,2010-12-02 16:35:00,769,outa that 12 of them are Canadians hahahahahahahahaha
524607,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 16:36:00,5865," SORRY but rumor is Toronto has had their chance and did NOT support the NFL each and every time they played a game there....  However, I wish they would go north and my taxes will not raise as fast."
524610,blaque,2010-12-02 16:39:00,2419,Looking for a grain of salt
524611,canadadude,2010-12-02 16:39:00,769,"I guess not, when the NFL decides to send a football team north perhaps there will be support, instead they send the Bills hehehehehehe"
524612,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 16:45:00,5865, Maybe after you catch up with you Hydro bill loans you can think about purchasing a PSL that will give you the right to purchase a ticket to the Toronto Bills...
524615,Harrison,2010-12-02 16:53:00,2202, You've never dated a southern belle then!
