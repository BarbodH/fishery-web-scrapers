Back in the old days (Warren Plummer who built the lodge) came up to GBL for the first time in 1949 and used tent camps for his clients until the lodge was built. After years of taking out the big girls the area around sawmill bay was essentially fished out so in the 1980's the whole camp was moved nearly 200 miles North to the Dease Arm of GBL. They moved the camp in the winter over the ice to where it resides now. Even in the 80's they were still allowing large fish to be taken out. It wasn't until the mid to late 90's they finally restricted harvesting and made it C&R and only kept smaller fish under 28"" for shore lunch. The fishing back at the old location is improving since it was abandoned 30 or so years ago. There are now hoards of hungry 20 to 30 pounders roaming the area. In another 30 or 40 years hopefully things will be back the way they were in the old days."
