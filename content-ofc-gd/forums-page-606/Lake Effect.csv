524687,blaque,2010-12-02 19:35:00,2419,Parts of western new york are getting pounded with some pretty serious lake effect snow as some of you southern ontarians may know.  You guys getting any up there? (snow that is)  I snowblowed over a foot before work and am currently at work  (out of the snowband right now to the north). But I know im going to return home to have to clean out another mess as its been snowing at the house all day!
524693,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 19:44:00,5865," We're buried here in Lancaster....snowblowed 3 times and shovel 3 times since 7am.....still coming down...Tundra pulled out 2 Dodge Rams, 3 Ford F150's and a crashed up Chevrolet....ha ha ha"
524697,Spiel,2010-12-02 19:48:00,9065,"No snow here in Hamilton.  It's tried a little but lake effect rarely affects us on the predomiately west winds. East winds, well that's another story."
524728,Twocoda,2010-12-02 21:15:00,4130,its been snowing here on the lake since last night ...it is finally starting to accumulate as the ground is still soft...snow plow went by this morning but i havent fired up the blower as of yet...
524731,misfish,2010-12-02 21:23:00,29133," Never happen.You probly need glasses,,,,,,,,,,It was probly those GMC trucks."

524767,Fisherman,2010-12-02 22:51:00,7201,I'll bet ya forgot to add that you pulled them out all at once...I'll bet ya used a nylon rope cause a chain would be too heavy for your toy to carry....
524781,Billy Bob,2010-12-02 23:39:00,5865,"REAL men use cables not chains....ever seen a chain break under stress....just like a bullet flying who knows where....  I have seen 3/4 inch chains break and even 1.25"" cables break...but a cable gives you a warning."

524959,tipupesox,2010-12-03 15:12:00,167,"It snowed for around 18 hours at my house.  Live on the South Cheektowaga, Lancaster border.  Luckily my sons kept up with the snow removal since the college they attend was closed.  It is all luck of the draw or should I say direction of the wind when dealing with Lake Effect.  "
524995,blaque,2010-12-03 17:10:00,2419, Wow and theres no houses on fire in the background or anything........surprising    (inside reference to another thread)
524998,kickingfrog,2010-12-03 17:21:00,8333,I live in Ontario's snow belt so I am very familiar with the term... I usually say it with the same intensity as a favourite 4 letter curse.
525067,tipupesox,2010-12-03 20:29:00,167,[Wow and theres no houses on fire in the background or anything........surprising   (inside reference to another thread)]  And no street people looking for cash.  Guess he has never ventured to Spaulding Lake in Clarence.
