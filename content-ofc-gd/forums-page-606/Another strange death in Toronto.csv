524878,thatleetboy,2010-12-03 04:00:00,143,"Kinda scary for those of us who actually live here....  My wife picked up my son early at daycare today, so they could go to the library...  Luckily, she got delayed, spending 10 minutes talking to the caregivers. I'm pretty darn thankful they didn't see this... frankly, I've never been so thankful she's such a chatterbox.   Life is so random.    Cheers"

525220,Dave Bailey,2010-12-04 04:07:00,1641,"Paranoia strikes deep... Now they are going to have a security guard there to give staff and customers peace of mind. What?! The suspect is in custody, the victim is dead, it's not as if there's going to be a sudden rash of crossbow assassinations at the Main Street library. I feel for those who were emotionally distraught at what transpired, but we don't need to baby them, they'll get through it. The human mind is a lot stronger than many of our 'leaders' give us credit for. I am very socially liberal, but I really hate this nanny state philosophy."
