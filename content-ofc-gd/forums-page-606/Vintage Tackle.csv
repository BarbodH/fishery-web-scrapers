523312,baitrummer,2010-11-27 19:48:00,24,I have recently acquired these genuine Heddon 'spooks' and a Shakespeare 'Triumph' level winding reel.Both the reel and the lures have the origional box. The reel still has it's papers. All are in very good condition. I have no intention using this gear but I am interested if anyone could tell me some interesting information regarding them. Thanks

523314,baitrummer,2010-11-27 19:57:00,24, It was manufactured by the John Inglis company out of Toronto. Thanks for the info and link

I think that reel pre-dates the Shakespeare ""Wonder Reel"" I received for Christmas when I was twelve...(1948)"

524099,misfish,2010-12-01 00:46:00,29133, So that would make you????????????????  Very nice lures .  My pop has all of them and even older from his pop. I am only allowed to look still and not touch.
