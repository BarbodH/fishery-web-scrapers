524672,fishnsled,2010-12-02 19:03:00,3520," I'm sure that's what they meant too Brian, but do you really want to run it without opening a door first?. I guess it's no worst then running a propane heater. Thanks for adding the link Geoff. I wonder what it weighs?"
524677,Rod Caster,2010-12-02 19:14:00,5784,"Great idea. I'd like to hear some testimonials before getting one though. That'll be a lot less fuel spilled on the ice, in your car/truck, in the shack, on your gloves..."
524678,Terry,2010-12-02 19:15:00,14456,I would be worried about laying it down the wrong way and screwing it up
524683,misfish,2010-12-02 19:23:00,29133,"  Ahh never mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
524698,Sharkbait22,2010-12-02 19:50:00,297,Great idea -  no more gas stink.  I wonder if it works in -25oC? Propane doesn't seem to flow when it is this cold.  See what the northern Ontario boys and girls think.
524709,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-02 20:14:00,10439,"Better go to the gym first, they weigh a lot more than most of the other options out there. I think the 10"" weighs 43#.     Compare that to a 2 stroke Strikemaster 10 1/4"" at 27#.  Then there's the fuel vaporization issue at cold temps. Propanes boiling point is about -40 and anytime you get close to that LPG will not vaporize."
524721,myot,2010-12-02 20:38:00,131,The cost of operation would be out of this world with the cost of propane now
524744,irishfield,2010-12-02 21:51:00,26272,Well.. in the temps we fish in.. no thanks! That thing ain't gonna even start when it's -36C !!!

524762,aplumma,2010-12-02 22:40:00,6896,91600 btu per gallon of propane $12.35 US per gallon (per 4 disposable cans) with 21% less energy.  115000 btu in a gallon of gas at $2.89 US per gallon. I am pretty sure I will not be jumping on the propane small engine band wagon anytime soon.   Art
524930,Steve Piggott,2010-12-03 13:48:00,196,My f150 is propane powered and it has to start on gas to warm up the engine before the propane kicks in. I'm paying 60cent per litre compare to gas a $1.12 I think you would have trouble starting it in cold temps.
525046,Uncle Buck,2010-12-03 19:40:00,1000,hold the propane tank in your float suit to keep it warm...  plus side to the propane powered is the fact that your hands won't stink of gasoline...  like everything new... wait a season or 2 for them to get the bugs worked out...
