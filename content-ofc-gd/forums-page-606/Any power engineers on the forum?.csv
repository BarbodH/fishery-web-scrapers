524475,livinisfishin,2010-12-02 03:34:00,661,"Hey flick I'm a gas tech 2 , been employed for about 3 years. I've applied to st.clair college in windsor to take a two year program to come out with a fourth class ticket.. I realize with the right companies the benefits are very attractive.. Do you think it is worthwhile to go to college for two years or do you think I can get it by working? If working is the way to go where could I start in order to land my first job and become fourth class?  Thanks  Jason"
