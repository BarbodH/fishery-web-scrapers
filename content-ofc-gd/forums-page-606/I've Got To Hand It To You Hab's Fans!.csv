I felt the need to stick up for my team (the Leafs) after some particularly nasty, rub salt in your wounds comments by a couple of Hab's fans.  The very next day low and behold my inbox is full of Montreal Canadien fan info. Newsletters, team info, etc.  I've been unable to rid myself of this.  And I'm get this crap sent to me on a daily basis.  I believe someone on the board signed me up for this abuse, it's waaay too much of a coincidence.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not full of anger here. In fact I kind of admire the ingenuity.  One day you'll get yours."

524643,solopaddler,2010-12-02 18:15:00,8605, Actually got that fixed finally. (when I tell you what the problem really was you'll laugh. I'm such a tard.  )
524644,solopaddler,2010-12-02 18:17:00,8605, No.  That would be better than what I am getting by a long shot.
524645,Spiel,2010-12-02 18:17:00,9065, I'm always ready for a good laugh....LOL You know the number.
524648,Mike Pike,2010-12-02 18:23:00,1332,I'd still rather blame Habs fans.
