Ashley with a catfish   so, i decide to try somethin different, and tied on a small inline spinner, i believe it was a 1/8oz size and a shiner pattern. i then proceeded to pound the shore line, casting to weeds and sunken timber, overhanging trees. this creek is SNAG CITY! so, after several casts, finally a hookup!  baby OSS Largemouth   after a quick picture he swam off, soon after i hooked into another one.    i then got a decent bluegill on the end of a sunken log. did not get a pic of the bluegill. kept moving along the shore, blind casting, and casting to the visible structure and cover. not long and another hook up!! this time, a little weight to it... after a small battle, i get to see a nice sized largie. puts up a fun fight on a 5'6"" med action rod with 6# mono. finally land her and after a quick smile for the camera, off she swims.  she was a good 2.5-3lbs.     i got one more small one after that to end the day.    all Bass were released quickly and swam off to fight another day. I was NOT targeting Bass as we all know they are currently out of season until the last saturday in june. the panfish were just not biting that day. i came back the next evening and landed a few bluegills with one being a nice big one. seen a few cats caught, as well as a small carp and a crappie."
