195535,ranger520vx,2008-05-02 18:23:00,164,Well its that time of year again- Pike opens in Lake Ontario.  Too bad its gonna be a wet one.  Anyone here planning on being there?  Best of luck wherever you may be headed.
195537,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-02 18:29:00,241,I'm pretty sure I'm hitting it. Not too sure about the island though. I was thinking of working it from the mainland!
195539,ccmtcanada,2008-05-02 18:31:00,7971, Good luck!  Dont forget your tourney sign....LOL.
195540,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-02 18:32:00,241, Ha ha ha! I just printed 'er up!
195543,snag,2008-05-02 18:41:00,1932,I might try to sneak out for a few hours in the west end.  Islands should be awesome!
195587,Jigger,2008-05-02 20:54:00,1237,"guys, check your regs before you head out. T.O. harbour is part of Div. 16. I posted a thread asking about the boundary regs. I never got a for sure answer, but I'd call ahead just to be sure. I'm definately going to be getting out next weekend, though. If it is open, good luck to you!"
195597,snag,2008-05-02 21:12:00,1932," Hey Jiggsy,  T.O. harbour is part of Div. 20, amigo  Here it is from the MNR regs:  WATERBODY EXCEPTION DETAILS  All waters of Zone 20, including the Niagara River (downstream of Niagara Falls).

195727,Fisherpete,2008-05-03 01:41:00,1814,"I was thinking of heading down to the islands on Sunday with my boat, but I seem to remember that you need some sort of Harbour licence? If so, where can these be had? Oh, and where can I check if I have been added to a team for the tourney?"
195728,Jigger,2008-05-03 01:42:00,1237,"Hey Snag/snog/Snap, where were you when I posted on this earlier in the week¿ llol I was just trying to save someone from getting a ticket, or worse. I´m hoping to plant some hooks in a Laker or two tomorrow, so makes no dif to me. Go get úm hombre."
195887,bassfighter,2008-05-03 16:18:00,366,"Hey Fisherpete,  It is not just a license, but one has to take the exam as well. Just dbe check to make sure.  Tightlines"
