195710,Rybren,2008-05-03 00:40:00,28,I recently moved to the Ottawa area and am looking for someplace near by to go trout fishing.  Any suggestions?  Thanks
195711,Tinman,2008-05-03 00:45:00,376,"There is a trout farm, just outside of ottawa called thistle spring trout farm, that lets you fish their ponds that are fully stocked. Not sure on pricing for it hough and i haven't been there in about 20 years so not sure what to expect either"
195726,Rybren,2008-05-03 01:34:00,28,"Tinman,  Thanks for the input.  It might be a good place to bring the boys, so I'll see if I can find it. I was, however, hoping to find someplace where I could find a bit of stream or river action.  Cheers"
195730,tip-up,2008-05-03 01:44:00,94, Alls I can suggest is to pick up the Backroads Map book from Chapters...There are hundreds of lakes to fish trout within an 1 1/2 drive north or south of Ottawa. The book is a great place to start.  Hope this helps!
195778,Musky or Specks,2008-05-03 04:41:00,2710,I thought I read somewhere that they were stocking the Ottawa River itself with browns.
195798,jonnybass,2008-05-03 09:51:00,346,I would think Quebec is the first place to start looking.
195801,tip-up,2008-05-03 10:19:00,94,Quebec would be North of Ottawa LOL..The Ottawa R. is stocked with browns..
195806,jonnybass,2008-05-03 10:54:00,346," I thought that Quebec has world class spec fishing but I may be wrong. Quebec is pretty close to Ottawa, no?"
195812,muskymatt,2008-05-03 11:21:00,2608,Hey Rybren  I fish the Ottawa area extensively for trout...send me a pm if you want to get together and detail a map for you.
195844,Rybren,2008-05-03 13:14:00,28," Yes, it is.  The Ottawa River forms the border between Ontario and Quebec.  As the crow flies, La Belle Province is about 1.5km from my place.  Thanks to all of you for your inputs.  Muskymatt, a PM is forthcoming.  Cheers"
