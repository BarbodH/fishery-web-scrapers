195797,jonnybass,2008-05-03 09:49:00,346,"The perch in Orillia are doing fine this year. They are definitely biting, with some really good limits. Stick to the regular perch stuff, you'll be OK. I don't know about the narrows specifically, but I hear that the area is rocking as usual this time of year.  That's what I heard."
195831,Fish Farmer,2008-05-03 12:07:00,2234,"Look for the boats. Make sure you got a fish finder. Move around till you see them on the bottom then anchor. Don't sit on a spot not catching. Sometimes you have to move maybe 50' Best place to get minnows is at Jacobs on #11 just before the first cut off to Memorial Dr. Catching lots. I'll be there Mon.,Tues. Only 4 tags have been caught out of 76  This is a SECRET Spot, don't tell anyone "
