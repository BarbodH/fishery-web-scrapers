195426,bigfish1965,2008-05-02 13:14:00,3382,"I meant to do this last month but was kinda busy so I'm catching up on stuff... Last quarter (Jan,Feb,Mar) was our busiest ever.  Here's some of the numbers If April is any indication, even these records will not last long. The month of April was the busiest month ever..by a long, long shot, so I will be keeping an eye on the server loads"

195435,largemouth,2008-05-02 13:33:00,112,thanks to Irishfield.
195450,Victor,2008-05-02 14:02:00,1609,"i wonder how many of those are related to ""marshmellow"" or ""i recognize that rock""  Thanks to all the Admins for keeping this place running!"
195562,ketchenany,2008-05-02 19:31:00,3229,"When they see ""Camp Jiggy Jiggy Report"" in the topic line, every one and his brother come in for a look,  Your work is well appreciated."
195579,jonnybass,2008-05-02 20:15:00,346,"If those numbers are accurate, I don't see why you even need the small % of people with ad-blockers to turn them off. You should easily be making enough green to cover your increase in server cost. You said $2,000/year right?  Hell, if you're only charging a third of what the rest of the market is charging for advertising, then why not just charge double what you're charging now and you'd still be undercharging, go get your dedicated server and problem solved? No?  Edit to add: Drop the google ads and use affiliate ads instead. The increase in revenue will more than pay for a dedicated server twice over."
195722,danbouck,2008-05-03 01:28:00,4380,All is great Rick! Don't change a thing  A thank you to everybody running this site
195724,jonnybass,2008-05-03 01:30:00,346,   Ummm... He said they are running out of bandwidth and the ad revenue isn't enough to upgrade their server.
195735,Roy,2008-05-03 01:56:00,13728,See HERE!
195776,bigfish1965,2008-05-03 04:29:00,3382," Affiliate ads do not pay more than Google Ads. Charging double would result in a loss of two thirds of our clients....maybe more. We track the number of ads being blocked and the number is increasing. It is still quite small, but as a courtesy to those who pay for this site, we are simply asking those who block to alllow on this site. Our bandwidth is fine, it is our disc space we have to worry about. We've set this thing up to use little bandwidth, but our MySQL database is now over 700 Mb"
