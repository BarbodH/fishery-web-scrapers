195964,Billy Bob,2008-05-03 20:34:00,5865,I believe Lowrance makes a portable packs that can be used on many of their units. Just go to the unit you are interested in and then click the accessory tab. Here's their website.  http://www.lowrance.com/en/Products/Marine...shfinders/X67C/
195967,irishfield,2008-05-03 20:39:00,26272,One thing to be aware of if going portable is the colour eats power much faster than the monochrome. Noted that while I was bumming batteries from Ron this winter for my 102C.. while he used his 135 Monochrome without even recharging for the next day.
196009,Pmacdonald,2008-05-03 21:45:00,5,"Hi Tonyrome69,  Irishfield is right; colour monitors do kill the batteries in portable devices very fast.  If you are not dead set on a colour display, I would suggest you take a serious look at a Hummingbird 535 or 565 portable.  http://www.humminbird-gcomm.com/humminbird...35-Portable.htm  They have great displays, the battery life is great, they show temperature, and have optional speed upgrade.  The carrying cases are very rugged and the units are just a tough.  I purchased the 535 protable last year and have no complaints.  The refresh rate it great; it even gives you clear picture even when you boat is moving, and it gives you clear indication on the hardness of hte bottom structures etc.  Regardless of what you choose, I hope you find one that works for you."
