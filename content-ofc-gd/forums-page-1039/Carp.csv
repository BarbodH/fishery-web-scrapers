196392,PickerelHunter,2008-05-04 18:08:00,100,Hey guys...Just wondering if anyone could share an area near Barrie that is productive for carp.  I've seen quite a few surface in the Barrie marina but the boats are in so the fishing is off limits there now.  Anywhere along the north shore of Kempenfelt maybe?  Any help would be appreciated  Thanks PH

Or along Soldiers Bay, where Queensville Road crosses the Holland . . . . .   just toss in along the shore at the east side, along the road in to the marina. Good for a few more weeks till it weeds up."

I fish that swim alot, right now you can use bottom baits as there are little weeds. When the weeds come in strong use a piece of foam to make your bait pop up and a split shot about 3 in from the hook. I usaually use pop up rigs all the time there and make a killing from end of April to end of August.  Hope this helps, Daniel  P.S. The sizes range from 1lb - 8lbs. Nothing Big  "
