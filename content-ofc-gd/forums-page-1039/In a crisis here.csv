196046,TennesseeGuy,2008-05-03 22:51:00,957,"I'm sorry about your loss.  Do whatever is reasonable to keep things going smoothly.  This may seem cold on my part, but did his brother offer to cover the financial part of the arrangements he made?"
196085,urbanangler1990,2008-05-04 00:43:00,933," he was on ODSP, its covered by them   this is too much to handle, we just heard his brother is doing everything, and is taking all the ashes to BC with him, its getting tougher, mom feels like she has been kicked to the side, she begged the brother and sister for apart of the ashes, they said no, my stepdad hated this one particular brother, well at least now they can think this will make up for the many years they didnt want to be in his life  all my mother had was him, she has me and my sister but this man was there everyday and they became more like two girlfreinds, too her not getting some part of the ashes, which would at least give her the feeling he is there with us, omg, if there is a God, i question where?"
196099,perodimi,2008-05-04 01:14:00,124,"Hello Again Urbanangler,  You may not realize it but you've already pegged it. They, not you are trying to ""make up for the many years they didnt want to be in his life"". Ironic that the one feeling the most guilt is actively involved.  You say:  ""not getting some part of the ashes, which would at least give her the feeling he is there with us, omg, if there is a God, i question where?""  He's been with you all along, by both your sides. You just have to believe that and when you do, the significance of the ashes will pale in comparison. You and your mother came to his life, the others are coming to his death. What is more important?  So go on and follow your heart because God is already guiding you with your Step-Father by your side, you just don't know it yet. You need not question where God is just believe that you are where he needs you right now.  Stay Strong!  Peter"
195682,Big Cliff,2008-05-02 23:55:00,6899,"I am very sorry for your and your mom's loss!  I think the most important thing to remember here is that his body may be gone but his spirit will live on. It really doesen't matter what his original family does, what matters is what you do! Keep him in your hearts and his spirit will live on forever! I am sure he would have wanted it that way from the sound of it!  Peace be with all of you!"
195692,Roy,2008-05-03 00:09:00,13728,"Perodimi  (Peter) said it best. I could not have said it any better. Just stay close to your Mom for a good while bud. My heartfelt condolences to you both and your step dad's family as well.  Take care of yourself, you can't help Mom when you're in bad shape.  Be well."

195716,Nanook,2008-05-03 01:01:00,565,"Sorry, I cant help with your problem....but, please accept our condolences to you and your Mom."
195720,urbanangler1990,2008-05-03 01:24:00,933,"a tear nearly ran down my cheek, thank you all   he was on ODSP  he broke away from the 8 brothers and sisters they had, they were not good to him at all, he did not want to be in contact with them at all, neither did they toward him, its just quite frustrating that he said to my mom she is the decsion maker if something happens, then all of a sudden his unknown family comes in, the man died in our apartment, its just so sad  his brother wants it to be in bowmanville, my stepdad was born and raised in toronto, his parents were buried in scarbourough,   Gerrit, i dont think i got ur PM  thank u all"
195721,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-03 01:25:00,435,"Sorry for your loss Alex. My condolences are with you and your family.

195767,finfan,2008-05-03 04:14:00,44,"Very sorry to hear of your loss UA both you and your mom are in my thoughts and prayers. I can see how much your stepfather had meant to you and your mother. It shows in the way you talk about him and how great he was! You should feel blessed to have known and have him your lives as he felt blessed to have the both of you in his. Know that although we can never bring the people we care for back we can always bring back their memories. And that my friend...nobody can take away from either one of you.  You are a tremendously brave young man and your mom may need to lean to you for that. Be there for her and remember it's okay for you to cry also. I'm there for you bud and so are all the wonderful people who have shared their kind words, advice and experiences to you. We have all suffered losses in our lives and it really hurts when it's someone as wonderful as your stepfather. God Bless my friend and take good care of yourself and mom...finfan"
195795,pikehunter,2008-05-03 09:46:00,1659,Sorry to hear about your stepfather. You are sure to miss him and all of his helpful advise and his presence. I can't comment about your situation as I didn't know your family or his other family arrangement so any comments would not be fair to anyone.  Remember him fondly and he will be there for you in spirit.

195922,bigfish1965,2008-05-03 17:52:00,3382,"Sorry for your loss, UA. Cannot imagine what you are going through. As his wife, your mother has all say in his affairs unless a will says otherwise. She is responsible for his care both in life and after."
