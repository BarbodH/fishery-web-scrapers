Haul in the fish  I suspect that it's a little more complicated these days, but there are a ton of lakes and access roads in the area so finding someplace to fish shouldn't be a problem.  Here's a link to the NOTO site for the Longlac area:  h t t p://w w w.noto.net/regional.cfm/code/113/tbid/7  Remember to remove the spaces in the link.  You may want to consider continuing along hwy 11 another hour or so to Lake Nipigon.  They have some monster Specs in that lake.  The world record comes out of the Nipigon River at the south end of the lake .  Good luck, have fun, don't forget your bug spray.  Rybren"
