Included: off Mexico's Contoy Island, he finds thousands of sailfish feasting on sardines.  Superfish  WNED"

196570,pikehunter,2008-05-05 02:06:00,1659,"No problem. I'm glad all enjoyed the show, I have always been fascinated by sailfish and marlin. The Old Man and The Sea was a favourite story of mine when I was a kid and I can still remember seeing billfish come in on charter boats from when I was the age I was in my avatar picture.  There were some amazing scenes in that show. The schools of sailfish and schools of dolphin were incredible. And the size of the red squid! But really sad state of the billfish population off the S. American coast."
