196297,MJL,2008-05-04 15:18:00,2427,"It's always worth getting out IMO - Sure beats housework  Had a feeling that tribs were going to be blown this morning...They were.  Stopped at one trib, looked at it, went back into the car and drove to the next.  Probably spent more time traveling than actually fishing.  If at first you don't succeed, hop back into the car and drive to the next trib, or the next or the next...  In tough conditions, beggars can't be choosers.  The 2nd brown of the day - It was the smaller of the 2.  I'll take one of these any day over a blanking.   "
