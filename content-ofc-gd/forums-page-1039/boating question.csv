196343,Radnine,2008-05-04 16:50:00,1538,"Hi All. This is going to sound a bit weird, but I am looking for a safe place to drive my new boat. Live in Caledonia but the water above the dam still has trees sticking out of it and none of the public access ramps (at least the ones that I drive by) are open yet. I am looking for a place to work the motor through its break in period before taking it up north at the end of the month. Fishing at this point is almost secondary, but it would be nice to wet a line as well. I know that there is a lovely public ramp at Pier 4 Park in Hamilton, but I am not sure that my boat is big enough for scooting around the bay (16â€™ Fish Hawk). Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks, Jim"

196353,misfish,2008-05-04 17:05:00,29133,"OOPS I thought you were from Caledon,but it says Caledonia. Probly a little far for you to come and break it in.LOL Me bad"
196383,Radnine,2008-05-04 17:57:00,1538, It was a kind offer none-the-less Thanks.
196416,Garry2Rs,2008-05-04 19:25:00,1425,A 16 footer is more than enough for Hamilton Harbour unless there's a major storm going on. Launch behind Hutch's on Bay Street.  Make sure you have all your safety stuff in order.  Kids wearing theirs etc. because the Cops patrol in a big red Zodiac between doughnut runs and will check you out.  There's pretty good Perch fishing there this time of year.
196454,Woodsman,2008-05-04 22:22:00,1286,Pittock Conservation Park at Woodstock or Wildwood Conservation Park near St. Marys should suit your needs.
196472,pikehunter,2008-05-04 23:19:00,1659,"You'll be OK in Ham. Harbour, check wind direction and forecast first. Grand River at Dunnville is good too, launch at the Grand Island BBQ if it is open yet, the Boat Club by the beer store or Fishmasters."
