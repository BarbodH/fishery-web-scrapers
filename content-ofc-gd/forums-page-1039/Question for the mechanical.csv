The rotor is not resting in the correct position, wondering if there is a way to turn it so I can access the screw?   Hoping that I do not have to reassemble everything just to get the darn thing to move.  Thanks bly"
195858,Greencoachdog,2008-05-03 14:18:00,8163,"I think you can ""bump"" the ignition switch and turn it a little each time until you have it positioned right Carole.   Edited to say: It'll be a lot easier if you have someone watch the rotor while another person slightly turns the ignition key (just enough to engage the starter for an instant) and it make take a few tries for the rotor to come around into position."

195875,Oktravis,2008-05-03 15:28:00,62,"Bumping the motor over is the easiest way. Before you do that you should unplug the connector for the distributor. When you bump it ,the coil will still make spark. If you get one of those sparks it can be an eye opening experience.I speak from experience (happened to me more than once) travis"
