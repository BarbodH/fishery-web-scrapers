196037,Mattones,2008-05-03 22:32:00,587,This does look a little temping to buy one.
196040,johnnyb,2008-05-03 22:45:00,3413,"I would prefer to impart my own action without the retrieve being forced to be ""dancing"" all the time"
196057,GbayGiant,2008-05-03 23:14:00,1780,"Yeah, I would never use it personally but it could be good for taking friends or kids out fishing that don't have much experiance, it's definitely better than having no action and could be a good learning tool."
196071,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-03 23:44:00,698,I remember someone posted some instructions on how to make those with paperclips. I'll try to dig them up.
196080,firefisher,2008-05-04 00:18:00,22,I do agree it would be good for kids.  It looks like it would drive me nuts after about 3 casts!  If you do get it please let us know how you like it.  Cheers FF
196082,PatrickGG,2008-05-04 00:20:00,562,"I wouldn't even bother, just watching them dragging lures around at a slow pace showing no action goes to show it's a lure to catch fisherman i seen my lures do more action just by twitching my rod tip."
196084,drwxr,2008-05-04 00:40:00,453,"i made myself a couple from paper clip, and used last summer, they do a nice job and make the lure more live, i like it very much."
