196290,irishfield,2008-05-04 14:46:00,26272,"Peter, like many ship harbours a ""harbour licenced"" captain was required to be on ships coming into dock. Similar to needing one for foreign ships coming thru the St. Lawrence canal. The Toronto Harbour patrol apparently takes this a step further and requires small boat owners to have one. (which is a practical boat test I might add) My take on this is there is no sign TTBOMK when entering the harbour from the main lake and I suspect there isn't a sign at the boat launch either telling you that you are required to have one... so how would you know and I doubt they really have the power above the Federal boating requirements for pleasure craft to make you have one unless you are actually in the old ship yard area. Can they really expect a transient boater to anchor outside the harbour limits.. swim to their office and request a harbour licence test in one of the police boats before going back to their own and bringing it in to dock?   BTW.. I think this would be a good ""pet"" case for Kirk to take to task. Someone get charged and see if Kirk can get you off to set precidence!"
