196380,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-04 17:51:00,241,"I bought a whack load of P-line 30 lb test fluorocarbon  intending to make leaders. Like a dolt, I didn't realize that I would need sleeves and a crimper. Can I just use it with a barrel swivel attached to the main line and then tie the fluorocarbon direct to whatever lure I am using? Is 30 lb enough for pike or will they chomp right through it?"
