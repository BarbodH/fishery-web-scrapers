We will be four, then six,  then eight and back to six, frolickers over the course of the week, with Brian and I coming home on Thursday.  Lake trout will be on the plate at least once during our stay on the north arm, and Eric's Island and Frank's ashes will be honoured again.  Play nice now, and there will be a report on Friday or so."
