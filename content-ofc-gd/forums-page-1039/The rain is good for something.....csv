A good downpour always brings up the worms from the yard.  Since we are headed to Big Cliff's in the morning to help put in his dock, my little one is all excited to fish there.  After dinner, we put on her raincoat and went to see if there were any worms on the driveway....and we were in luck!  Here are a few pics from our worm picking expidition.  Some are a little on the small side, but a little worm food and they will be perfect for trout!        "

196199,Roy,2008-05-04 08:20:00,13728,Wish I could be there Cliff. You all have a great and safe time!
196208,motv8tr,2008-05-04 09:58:00,2587,Hope you all have a good day and good weather.  Maureen
196266,Big Cliff,2008-05-04 13:19:00,6899,"I don't know, wind has picked up, waves are running a good 12-16"", water is still about 10-12"" higher than normal. I got a feeling I am going to be going swimming   but that water sure is cold! Oh well won't be the first time, should make for some good pictures LOL.  Sue just put a big pot of hot coffee on, I think next year I'm going to invest in a wet suit or something LOL.  Well got to go get things ready!"
196306,MJL,2008-05-04 15:35:00,2427,"Seems like I wasn't the only one out last night - Managed about 50 worms in about 20min from my lawn.  My neighbours are used to my late night lawn perusing.  Great photos Cliff and good luck with the fishing.  If your daughter is into worm picking, come over to my lawn...Last year the grubs pretty much annihilated my front and back yard so the worms are now easy pickings - No grass to get in the way"
