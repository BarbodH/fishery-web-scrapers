Black/blue and pink/white patterns worked the best for my partner and I. Fish were tight to the brush, manouvering your bait around the structure was key to putting fish in the pail. In the next week most of these fish should start to move around a bit more and it will make it more of a challenge to locate the big fellas. Get out there while the fishin' is hot.        -Andrew"
