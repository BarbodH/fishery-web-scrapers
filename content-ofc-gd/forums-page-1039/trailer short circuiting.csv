Things went well until the signal lights went, and then the traction lights came on, then the ABS light came on and then the shifter was stuck.  To make a long story short, we had to be towed.  The next day Toyota came back to us and said that the trailer wires short circuited the switches and that it's not under warranty.  I thought the fuses would SC first before the entire switch.  Any one out there experienced similar issues?"

Mind you people just tap into the existing light wiring for trailer lights..and this doesn't work all the time anymore, with many needing isolators/converters. Maybe her vehicle was wired wrong?"
