195994,Zubris21,2008-05-03 21:19:00,563,"Well, Walleye opened today on the St. Lawrence and that meant an early start to the day for me.  The alarm sounded at 3:10 to get me up and I was packed and on the road by 3:30, stopped by timmy's for a coffee and a bagel and then it was an hour and a half drive up for 401 to Morrisburg to meet up with my buddy.  We had the boat in the water by 5:15 and it was nice and pleasant, only 2 other boats to start.  All in all it was a great opening day.  We spent about 3 hours on the water and landed 24 fish between 3 of us.  We kept our limit of some nice sized eaters, but of our total count 10 fish were over 26 inches and 8+ lbs, very unusual for this spot.  We often get lots of 2-4 pounders and the odd 5+ but today was something else.  (sorry to team kiss my bass, I didn't have any OFC 08 tourney signs)  but I'll make it up on Quinte next weekend and northern Quebec the weekend after.  Here are 2 pictures of my buddy and one of me with some of the bigger eye's (anything over about 4lbs was released after a quick snap shot.  More than I can say about some of the other boats!)     http://i290.photobucket.com/albums/ll254/Z...ningday08-4.jpg  http://i290.photobucket.com/albums/ll254/Z...ningday08-3.jpg"

196018,Zubris21,2008-05-03 22:00:00,563,"yup. bottom bouncing all the way?   The rain wasn't too bad, had our wet suites on so it didn't get to us too bad,  It is the reason why there aren't any more pics because I didn't bring my good camera due to the rain!"

196237,Chris,2008-05-04 11:59:00,405,"Wow, nice report....right in my neck of the woods too. Thx for sharing.   Not really unusual my friend. I went to a meeting a few years back, hosted by Steve Kerr (MNR) regarding the health of that stretch of the Larry. He was saying that all species were encountering problems, except for walleye which were flourishing. That was 7 or 8 years ago tho', but the st. Lawrence has always had really good walleye populations. My brother used to volunteer to help with walleye spawning gates etc. and says there are some real monsters in the Larry.  "
196241,medmart,2008-05-04 12:12:00,587,Nice looking eyes great way to start  the season  Rob
196415,Zubris21,2008-05-04 19:20:00,563," I'm not denying that there are monsters in there.  I've been fishing that section of the Larry now for about 3 years and we almost always catch our limit.  Usually the fish we get are anywhere up to 4lbs on average, with the odd one going 8-10lbs.  I was just saying its unusual for us to get that many big fish in that short amount of time."
