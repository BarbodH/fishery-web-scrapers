196108,jace,2008-05-04 01:34:00,472,"  that's my point exactly  which is why i brought up runners and secretaries.   Painters get tennis elbow injuries as often as tennis players, it doen't have to be physically exhausting activities..   And to a previous post...I doubt bob izumi  fish 14 hour days any more than Henry and Italo do.   I stopped watching his show probably a decade ago because it was nothing but product schlepping from boats to trucks and other fishing tackle."
196140,fishindevil,2008-05-04 02:40:00,6254,"I agree with lew,try salmon fishing for a few days straight !!!! awinging 12lb cannon balls & reeling in 400 ft of copper & wire line with dipseys & j-plugs ,as well as fighting 20lb + salmon all day...man the first few times i do it every year,it takes the arm & wrist muscles a few days to recover from that,....but maybe the man has a medical problem,like an injury or carple tunnel or something like that ???  either way i hope you get all healed up theres lots of fishing season left,get those muscles in shape bud !!!!    cheers"
196174,danc,2008-05-04 04:17:00,4677,I lift anywhere from 1/16th to 3/8 plate steel at work every day. No problems. But I have had sore wrists/forearms from such things as typing and fishing. MJL is on the right path here.
196192,jace,2008-05-04 05:37:00,472," The info is not printed on factory rods because 99% of them don't make their own blanks but if you go with a custom rod and choose your own blank, the blank weight is there for you to see.   StCroix, lamiglas, Pacific Bay, American Tackle and most others list the full blank specs and measurements including weight"
196272,bucktail,2008-05-04 13:35:00,1857,"Tendinitus can develop from simply having a set of muscled in constant tension. I fish muskies all day but my forearm tendinitus develops worse when I am dropshotting in the winter for perch. The tension without range of movement to releive it does it. Try a forearm strap made for tennis elbow if the problem is in your arm, this will help support the muscle and help take tension off it, helping it oput. Any drugstore has them. I have a bad rotator cuff that acts up, just bring tyelenol!"
195854,MJL,2008-05-03 14:09:00,2427,"For me, I'm probably one of the smallest guys out on the river - I'm not particularly tall or heavy nor am I very strong so finding the best way to lug around a heavy rod is important.  Consider the physics of levers. Fishing rods are just that.  You have a long length on one side of the fulcrum (where you place your hand) and a short length on the other (butt section).  Naturally physics is working against you in terms of what load you have to carry.  If you wanted to lift a heavy object, you'd push down with the long length between you and the fulcrum to lift load the short length.  You can have the lightest rod in the world but the physics of it is always working against you because of the fact that the butt section of a rod is always going to be shorter than the rest of it out in front of you.  There is also the multiplier effect - I'm no mathametician but it's something that I studied in operations management and ergonomics.  If you try to lift something farther away from you, the harder it will be and the greater the force needed to lift it.  Hence, this is the reason why people can get away with using heavier centrepins - They're located very close to the fulcrum...Stick it at the long end of 13ft of graphite and you've got problems - Ounces seem like pounds.  With that said some things you can do - Shove the butt end of the rod under your armpit so that it takes off most of the load - You yourself become the counterbalance rather than the 12 inches of cork and a rubber butt cap. - Find a position that keeps your wrist as straight as possible - A bent wrist kept in that position for hours will always hurt at the end of the day...That's why they used to sell those ergonomic computer keyboards that split in the middle.  It screwed with people's minds but at least it kept your wrist straight. - Switch up the way you hold a centrepin over the course of a day to minimize the repetitive strain on certain muscles in a particular position. - Take your rod and reel to a physician and have them help you find a good way to hold things to minimize strain and the chance of injury.  I took my rod and reel to school and showed my prof...He helped me understand what I needed to correct in my casting technique. - You can always blow $ and buy a custom rod and reel which may be lighter and better balanced.  One tip I've used from my experience in fly fishing is to use your body to cast.  Lefty Kreh advocates this is the best way to prevent screwing up your arm.  I tuck the butt section of the rod under my armpit and turn my body during the cast.  All the power generated comes from my body rather than just my arm.  You can't cast as far but I can cast to 95% of the places I fish.  It helps if you use slightly heavier weight on the business end to load up the rod during the cast and act as a weight for zinging it out.  Always stretch before fishing - sounds weird but it really is a physical activity.  These things have helped me.  I still do get sore wrists after 2 days of fishing 14hrs each day.  The pain is far less than what I used to experience."
195860,danc,2008-05-03 14:25:00,4677,Well said MJL. Being in shape has nothing to do with it at all.
195862,lew,2008-05-03 14:39:00,12767,"Try casting 10"" wooden baits for 12 hours, then you'll know what tired really means"
195874,MJL,2008-05-03 15:27:00,2427, That's what rod holders and trolling motors are for
195877,shane,2008-05-03 15:47:00,652, You need one of these.. 
195890,irishfield,2008-05-03 16:24:00,26272, Why I like to troll Lew ! lol
195895,lew,2008-05-03 16:32:00,12767,I think you guys are all just getting old
195901,GbayGiant,2008-05-03 16:51:00,1780,"   LOL, so now where comparing Bob Izumi to Lance Armstrong ? Come on guys it doesn't get any easier on your body than fishing, this is a joke to me (you guys are young, I can understand an old man getting a little sore). The next strenuous activity down from fishing is laying in a hammock all day with  a Corona, but let me tell you, that Corona bottle really gets heavy at the end of the day, maybe they should design some ultra light beer bottles too, my wrist is taking a beating."
195914,Casey123,2008-05-03 17:30:00,461,"Ok Ladies, think it is time for some off you to find another way to pass the time!"
195938,MJL,2008-05-03 18:48:00,2427," For me, it's not so much the weight that I'll be carrying throughout the day that I'm worried about, it's the motions involved compounded by the weight and carried over a long period of time (years) that I'm most worried about.  I'm young and fish hard now, I want to be fishing hard when I'm old.  I know a few anglers who had to give up the sport they loved because of injuries to their wrist, elbows and rotator cuffs - prominent in fly fishing, some in float fishing.  An activity doesn't have to be strenuous to cause injury.  You can be sitting down at your computer browsing the internet using a mouse and develop Tendonitis and/or tennis elbow - I did case studies on this in school and its surprising how much a problem ergonomics (or a lack thereof) actually is in the workplace.  Auto assembly workers who do nothing but screw bolts onto a car without having to lift anything can develop injuries.  Casting a rod for 14hrs a day over years can cause injuries.  Pain is a sign something is not right.  I love fishing and do my best to do it in ways to prevent injuries.  When I'm 80+ yrs old, I want to be able to do this - Definitely worth watching when it hits 2:30 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc3Z9okcH3A...feature=related  You don't have to feel pain when you're old."

196094,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-04 01:06:00,0,"I am just wondering if there are any rods with its center of gravity at the end of the rod not in the middle of the rod ... if so, it would be alot easier to balance it out with reels ..  Anything there?"
