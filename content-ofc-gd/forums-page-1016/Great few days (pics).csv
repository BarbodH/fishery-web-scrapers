After 4x4-ing last few km streach of the trail, we've arrived to the visible excitement of the black flies  View of the lake   For the first time I've had a""pikeless"" fishing trip, but no complains. We've managed to catch other species to try few new recipes    Few bigger ones    After two days the change of diet was necessary, so we've switched to different species       One of the ""visitors""    When we were leaving the lake was calm and peacefull again.
