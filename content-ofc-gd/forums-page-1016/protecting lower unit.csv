Can't help hitting them on unfamiliar territory, even if I tried to be cautious. Few times it happens and nothing wrong with my prop.  Some people says that the skeg protector do eats some gas on high speed  Its there a way to protect the nose of the lower unit? I was hoping that there would be some kind of rubber material that we can glue on it to absorb some shock when the lower unit hit some rocks."

I used to have one on my 20 and 15 ...saved me some lower units   &   $$$  ...gonna have one made for my 30... should cost 'boot 40 $  :Gonefishing:  Randy
214111,Victor,2008-06-11 11:50:00,1609,Can they be easily installed & uninstalled? If it is then maybe you can consider only putting it on when you're exploring unfamiliar waters?  The minor extra cost of gas would probably be nothing compared to getting a lower end fixed right? ...
214123,Greencoachdog,2008-06-11 12:23:00,8163,The very best protection you can find for your skeg and prop would be to fish deep water and stay out of the skinny stuff!!!
