213316,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 00:10:00,7971," I was wondering how this came back, but this reply was the best....LOL  I suppose he's not lying....a certain percentage released back in the water, the rest released to his dinner plate."
213346,ozaibak1,2008-06-10 00:36:00,401,"These days I am usually camping when I go fishing, so I try to bring back fish for the fire. I fish for fun, but I also enjoy good food. Like bringing back  perch in the half to one pound range, and bass in the 1-2 pound range. Would also do the same for walleye but I have yet to catch one. Also rockbass, mmm tasty rock bass. And crappie of course."
213443,addict,2008-06-10 02:42:00,475,mostly catch and release but im not afraid to get my fillet knife out for a good ol fry we kept about 20 eyes on our week trip for food so tasty.but i will eat other fish as well mostly keep fish when the weather and water is cold i find the meat to be nicer.probally wont have another fish fry till fall or winter.perch pike walleye all taste great in cajun fishcrisp.
213464,duber,2008-06-10 03:09:00,220,"Fish are food not friends  I grew up fishing for food so I still keep my share.  I love a good feed of fish.  Pike 3-4 pounds,walleye under 24 inches,2 pound bass,crappie 10-12 inches,bullheads and 10-12 inch perch are in a heap of trouble if they get pulled into my boat and I gots a hunger on.  I don't keep fish on every outing but I do take a few."
85432,Pasquale,2007-06-19 12:51:00,29,I vote #3  only time we keep fish is if we are having a shore lunch that same day or we will be having them for dinner that night. I never bring fish home so they can sit in the freezer.
85493,Golfisher,2007-06-19 15:16:00,586,Walleye during spring fishing trip; everything else is put back in the water.
85495,Motorhead,2007-06-19 15:21:00,163,"If it`s in season and edible (carp, suckers etc. I don`t really care for), I`ll eat it... To me nothing tastes better than something you`ve caught, cleaned and cooked yourself...  Doug"
85601,Patches,2007-06-19 18:54:00,48,"I believe an important part of healthy fish stocks is to catch and eat.  I try to only keep the small and mid-size fish and always release the big breeders (unless the are injured or came from very deep water).  I always also keep stocked fish (Chinooks, Coho and Steelhead) as they're are stocked for us to eat and not breeding (sucessfully) in the wild.  With Pan fish and Walleye I always keep the ""eater size""  For bass, I try to kept a limit of under 2lbers each trip, and all the big guys go back.  I wish more people would use this method.  It's good for the fish and the future fish would all come for bigger genetic strains."
85662,Moosebunk,2007-06-19 20:07:00,3970,"Catch and Release mostly.  But do keep about 100 fish per year for the family.  Walleye, trout, pike... it's not nice to discriminate so they all see the table."
86221,JerseyDog,2007-06-21 01:33:00,190,"I'm always looking for the perfect fish for dinner and I never can seem to catch it. And when I do, I usually like it so much, I toss 'em back anyway.  I mostly just keep the bad bleeders and I guess the Pickerel (if I could ever actually catch one)."
86495,setomonkey,2007-06-21 21:42:00,872,"#2 for me.  I keep only a few fish every year, usually a trout or walleye caught on my annual week-long trip (coming up really soon!). I'm not good at cleaning fish so I have almost never kept perch for the table, even though it is my favourite kind of fish.  Mike"
86572,huntervasili,2007-06-22 01:14:00,1604,"Personally all I really keep is walleye and panfish... Never kept any wild trout or anything off of my flyrod, that is 100% catch and release, but I do like the occasional fish fry..."
86633,ch312,2007-06-22 10:30:00,1590,"if im really tired and dont feel like cleaning fish, they stay there. but this doesnt happen too often so i usually bring some home for a meal. bass, catfish, panfish, pike, pickeral, trout, salmon, smelt, and the list goes on. muskie is pretty good too yet everyone says it tastes bad?"

86904,lilkynan,2007-06-23 20:09:00,173,"I love fishing. I love eating fish.  Waste not - want not.  Never waste anything, but I like to target my dinner."
92452,danw,2007-07-10 14:19:00,72,"I fish less than a dozen times a year. I keep a few panfish for the pan if they are a good size. I don't land on much other types of fish, mostly get small bass which goes back. If I am lucky I might get to keep few 2lb sized bass for the year."
92455,nautifish,2007-07-10 14:22:00,1416,# 3 for me  mostly perch as i really do love it and its damn yummy!..Only ever kept two bass which was last summer fishing & camping up north.  Allthough they tasted great i have tryed them now and  does not interest me to keep another one to eat!. So i basically keep the perch i catch and everything else i fish for is released back into the water.
92627,Greencoachdog,2007-07-10 20:55:00,8163,I personally like to keep all the nice big healthy ones for the table... but I do release ALL my mortally wounded fish.
92694,Rich Clemens,2007-07-11 00:23:00,3131,"Pretty much catch and release.   On one of our trips for bass, we'll keep 2 to have a fish fry.   Other than these couple, everything else is released.   Of course .. the Lakair fish fry and derby may be a bit of a different story.  As I was skunked for both ... my routine stands firm.  (Just you all wait until next year)."
92901,gforce,2007-07-11 14:24:00,63,Keep the small ones if you are going to eat fish.  Release the big boys to maintain the big genetic strains.
213206,jwl,2008-06-09 20:53:00,1056,"#2, I fish for the fun of it, and have been pretty much on a quest for the next trophy sized fish of many species for over the last 25 years.  I will keep the odd chunky pike if it's hooked bad and might not make it(generally I don't fish with cranks loaded with hooks because of this)  otherwise I keep maybe 6-8 fish a year that's it..more often than not it's less than that...so say 8 fish out of hundreds a year, not a bad ratio  ..last year I kept 2 pike and 4 walleye all year, I don't like eating fish all that much and don't like salmanoids, I kept 1 rainbow this past winter season out of probably 100 I caught cuz I weighed it in for a derby. That one I donated to my neighbour when i got home."
213223,camillj,2008-06-09 21:20:00,1988,"My doctor says I need more omega-free-fatty-ass !!!!!!   So ... I keep the following (within regs) ... rainbow, specks, salmon, brown, pickeral, whitefish .... most saltwater gamefish on the RARE occasion I get to fish for them.  But I Normally dont keep Bass, Pike (actually I do sometimes) , Musky (cant take the wrath of the Musky hunters and dont like to kill anything older than 4 years anyways), perch ... too many have to die for a meal"
213225,cranks bait,2008-06-09 21:20:00,721,"Last year I kept all my walleye I caught for the table, all one of them.  Also kept about 6-10 bass through the season, mostly small.  Had to eat a four pounder because it was not going to live.  I was really embarassed and felt bad because it was a big one.  I try to stick around 2.5.  For the amount I fish, that is not much.  My wife this year keeps telling me when I go out to get dinner.  So far there has been no dinner.  Have to make her stop saying that."
213236,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-09 21:34:00,3761,Only ever keep fish on long camping trips. Mostly bass.
213239,DanTheMan,2008-06-09 21:39:00,257,"I voted #3 also.  I do eat lots of  walleye , but  release them also.But, when I am hungry for them, well, I keep  my share"
213243,nancur373,2008-06-09 21:45:00,1211,I grew up fishing to eat. Don't have a lot of time in fishing in Ontario but I know as I learn more places and species to fish I will not be keeping nearly as much.
213252,Moosebunk,2008-06-09 22:01:00,3970,"100%  C&R...  Ummm gotta run, pike on the BBQ's burning."

213306,Joey,2008-06-10 00:00:00,9122,"Hmmm, a year old post????  Somebody was bored"
85203,Fisherman,2007-06-18 22:38:00,7201,"Within good reason and limits, I eat what I catch except for fish like musky, sheepshead, carp.  If I'm going to spend time fishing, then eating some is part of the equation.  I don't like going around poking holes in fish I'm not going to eat."
85252,Clampet,2007-06-19 00:17:00,1947,"#3 Don't ferget, I gotta deal with Jethro! "
85262,Corey,2007-06-19 00:34:00,355,"For the 2 or 3 times a year I go fishing for walleye, to keep 4 if I can catch them, I will keep all 4. I also have a wife and 3 kids. 4 walleye at 3 pounds each, is good for... well... about 1 meal for the family. I enjoy fishing and all, but I enjoy eating them as well. Considering the time and money I have invested in fishing, I better be able to keep a few fish each time I go fishing. Would I go fishing every day and bring home a limit of fish? Not a chance, but for the few trips I make, and the even fewer times I bring home fish, there is no reason for me not to bring them home.  If anyone complains about people taking too many fish, for any reason other than legal reasons is full of it. Pollution, Cormorants and certain people who harvest fish commercially under the guise of feeding their family or rights to fish are far more of a problem to the fish population than a few poachers.  I hope nobody takes offense to my opinion, but anyone who has their eyes open will understand what I am talking about.  cd."
85272,Canuck2fan,2007-06-19 01:09:00,1444,"I voted for number 3  I fish for bass, perch, and chrome mainly. I have a favorite spot where the bass remain edible (worm free) all season. So for the first couple of outings I will keep a few for the family. After a couple of feeds though I release most of what I catch when it comes to bass. Any other spot for bass I know before I leave the house I am releasing them all that day, mainly because I can't see killing a fish I know will be wormy....  Perch, I fish for so they can be eaten. I like nothing better than getting 20 perch over 10""s an outing to come home. I am very selective in size compared to a lot of people I've seen lately.... In my case I have a number of family members who grew up eating perch and have no way of getting them unless they buy them a week old in supermarket, so I like to try get those folks a couple of meals a year, which I happily catch, clean and even cook if necessary. It is a family tradition to have fresh perch cooked breaded with smashed saltine crackers, maple baked beans and dollar fries. For many in the family this is the ultimate summer comfort food.... Having a fish fry brings back a lot of memories of when those folks were young enough and other family members were still alive who fished for them as well.  For chrome I try to release all larger healthy fish, as I feel they will be the best breeders. I do like to keep 2 to 4 lbers for the table, but never take more than 2 per trip home. If I harvest a large female for roe I get the flesh smoked so as not to waste it. I am not a great steel header by any means so if I take 10 to 12 fish during the trib season which is from Sept till June most years that is a good year in my books."
85274,ccmtcanada,2007-06-19 01:11:00,7971,"Bly and I have kept 3 fish...one was a huge 15 pound walleye, which unfortunately could not be live released.  The other two were steelhead....for fresh roe and a few nice meals.  Other than that, we always release."
85282,Mike the Pike,2007-06-19 01:39:00,3421,I mostly catch and release but I love to eat Walleyes and perch .Pike and Bass go back in the water .Speckled trout are tasty.I had Lake trout for the first time this year and I have to say next time I will let it go .Not as good as speckles.  I would have to say 70% of the time I catch and release.  MTP
85288,bbog,2007-06-19 01:48:00,665,I am mostly catch and release except when hooked badly or looking for Crappie.
85332,MJL,2007-06-19 02:49:00,2427,"I keep 2 bass per year when I go camping with friends.  Other than that, I hate cleaning fish - Especially panfish...But if someone offers to fillet, coat, fry and clean up the mess, I'm all for catching a little more for the table. I generally practice catch and release 99.9% of the time.  There was one time I kept a Lake O salmon for eggs + dinner.  Walking 2+km with a 25lb carcass is something I don't want to do again - Especially with my bad back and all.  On the bright side, it tasted alright with the recipe I got from Shelly and Courtney involving fresh wasabi and low sodium soy sauce. The skein was also mint."
