To cut a long story short.....I think I ordered the freshwater edition and its the salt water models that were on sale, I hope the guy I talked to on the phone caught onto that I wanted the OFC deal.  So the freshwater and saltwater reels retail for the same price....whats the difference? why would they sell a fresh water version that has inferior rust resistance?  http://www.quantumfishing.com/fwreels/energyPT_baitcast.html  http://www.quantumfishing.com/swreels/ener...s_baitcast.html  any good info is good info.  forrest"

A lot of people pick the seals off their freshwater reel bearings  -drags and bodies are almost all sealed in saltwater reels especially the surf reels used in salt and sand"
