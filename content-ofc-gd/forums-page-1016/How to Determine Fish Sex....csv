213540,Gerritt,2008-06-10 12:22:00,6129,"With some species of fish is is simple to identify a male from a female ie. Rainbows...  But how do you determine the sex on say a Pike, or a Walleye (without gutting the fish to find her full of eggs)  I understand some fish are still spawning? Due to the late winter.. and would like to ensure I am releasing the females so they can do their duty...  So what say you?   G"
213542,Roy,2008-06-10 12:26:00,13728,Prolly can just give them a road test. Sex is determined by score...as it were.
213550,Stoty,2008-06-10 12:39:00,2910,"If the fish is difficult and stubborn to bring in...its a female. If it comes in easily and doesnt really seem to care much, its a male.    (j/k ladies, but it was just so wide open for a joke...)"
213552,Stoty,2008-06-10 12:40:00,2910,Maybe this article will help you?
213554,muskymike,2008-06-10 12:42:00,772, Hahaha I was thinking the same thing
213561,ecxstriper,2008-06-10 13:19:00,343,If the said fish starts to complaining that you are not landing it correctly or for that matter doing anything else right I would say it is a female

213911,smbhunter,2008-06-10 23:37:00,186,"For pike and muskie it is quite simple, generally anything 10lbs or more will be a female over 90% of the time. For any other species it is quite difficult to tell, even to a trained professional."

213955,HTHM,2008-06-11 00:32:00,4082,The fish that have their mouths opening and closing all the time are probably the females.....
213957,Musky or Specks,2008-06-11 00:38:00,2710,"If when you boat the fish its starts regurgitating its food-female model fish  If you can see lots of fish but only the occasional one hits, its a guy they wont pass up an easy meal  If a fish eyeballs your bait critically but doesnt hit, its a female."
214018,Stoty,2008-06-11 02:26:00,2910," In the good way, or bad way?????"
214140,Meely,2008-06-11 13:49:00,282,I think it was Pigeon Fisher who said it best in a similar post a while back.  When you boat the fish.....call it FAT !! If it starts to cry....probably female !!  Meely
