212951,Victor,2008-06-09 11:31:00,1609,"  What's wrong with that?  To my understanding, at least with my dad ... father's toys = son's toys"
212983,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 12:31:00,7971,Very nice new ride!  Nice crack on the inheritence....LOL...had me laughing this morning....
213018,JohnF,2008-06-09 13:41:00,3494," I figgered I could use that on my wife but I can't get our son interested in any of my hobbies except golf, and since he's the pro I get to plasy with his toys, not vice versa. Now, if I were to decide to become a serious musician he'd be right there helping me pick out guitars, amps etc. It's sad when the son does only uncool things like renovating houses, playing golf, and making music. He has no interest in my motorcycles, snowmobiles, scuba diving, or fishing. He's really not much fun at all.  JF"
