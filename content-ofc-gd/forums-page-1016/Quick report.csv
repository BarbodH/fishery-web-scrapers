Decided to take a break for a bite to eat and threw out a jig and boated this 12 and 3/4 inch slab.    Into the livewell in hopes of putting together a meal.  Fished for couple more hours with only smaller fish willing to bite.  Back she went for someone to catch another day.  Off the water around 3 and headed to my nephew's 21st birthday.  Talk about feeling old, not him!  Me.  The boat will be dry docked for a couple of weeks now but I'll still be fishing.  We will be flying in to Mikwam with Cochrane Air on Friday morning.  BIG report to come."

213111,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-09 17:32:00,0,I think the sun has driven the Musky's deeper in the day. Nice Crappie. You could have had a meal with that slab. With some fries on the side!

213624,fishnsled,2008-06-10 15:29:00,3520,"Thanks for the replies.  ccmt - We'll definitely get out for some carp when I get back.  Was hoping to do it before I left but just too much stuff to get done before I go.  HH - Sorry for not calling but with the running around I had to do I didn't want to drag someone along not knowing when I'd be on the water.  JB - Yep, was working the weed edges breaking into 12ft of water in an area where I had many muskies before.  For some reason they didn't want to say hi that day.  The crappie would have made a nice meal for one.  I've already had a good feed of them and decided to let it go to grow for another day."
