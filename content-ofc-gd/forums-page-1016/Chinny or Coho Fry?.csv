213379,silverstreak,2008-06-10 01:22:00,146,Can anyone tell if this is a chinny or a Coho salmon fry. Fish had a white mouth. Thanks. 
213384,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 01:27:00,7971,"Hmm...hard to say...found this image on the net....I'd say it looks closer to chinook though   When I read the thread, I thought you were frying them to eat....lol"
213386,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 01:32:00,7971,Here's another shot of Coho fry that I found...

213729,jace,2008-06-10 18:33:00,472,Did it roll or make straight runs when you were fighting it?  That'll tell you which it is.   heheh.  anal fin.  most likely a coho.
213865,kickingfrog,2008-06-10 22:14:00,8333,"I'll say Chinook based on this key that I made up when I was in school. The key for adult salmons, trouts and chars is different than this one for juveniles 2-5 inches long.  "
213902,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 23:28:00,7971, Wow...that's pretty cool kickingfrog!!  Thanks for the insight!
213968,silverstreak,2008-06-11 01:05:00,146,Thanks all
