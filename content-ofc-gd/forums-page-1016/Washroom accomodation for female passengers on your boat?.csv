213428,Rombo,2008-06-10 02:27:00,39,Its very easy tell her to wear a bathing suit. hope in the water use the lake as your personal washroom.
213432,Joey,2008-06-10 02:30:00,9122,"I have my bucket also, or over the side if nobody is around.  Hey, if the boys can do it........  Joey  p.s.  Tracker, that thing would definately be worse than going over the side.  Who has time to aim when they're on BOQ in rollers and you have to take off 3 layers of clothing and freeze your....... off."
213472,POLLIWOGG,2008-06-10 03:25:00,835,"Just to be a gentleman, usually slow down to around 20 , but if you loose her off the back and she finds out theres a head in the cuddy, look out."
213492,wolfville,2008-06-10 04:57:00,396,"Victor, you can always leave her at home and take me instead. That would solve your problem."
213499,jace,2008-06-10 08:02:00,472,"If you're smart, you'll never get a boat with a full head...that'll keep them off the long fishing trips.   The grossest setup i ever saw was a head installed in the middle bunks.  gotta know the people sleeping around you very well to be able to use that setup."

213503,Tarzan's Jane,2008-06-10 08:26:00,1183,"Well...who hasn't done it in a cup..(for the doctor), just make sure it's bigger than a dixie cup   ...and a real gentleman would hold the cup.      Back in the good old days I'm sure that's what men use to do. Not sure that I would feel comfortable hanging my butt over the edge...it's a matter of how much I trust...guys are always looking for a laugh at a woman's expense.  j e r k s   -  just kidding guys."
213539,JFR,2008-06-10 12:18:00,498,"pick up a small porta-pottie, and your set to go.  It was my wife's idea to buy one.  The only time she is reluctant is in November when she has to remove three layers and a survival suit.  Just JOHN"
213586,Headhunter,2008-06-10 14:01:00,5703,"The splash well works very well based on my experience (with my wife). Gernerally though, when I take my wife fishing with me, she prefers to be dropped off on an island, to sun bathe and swim, so that takes care of that... but she will also jump up on shore and hide behind a tree... she won't get in a boat outside of the summer months so the fall and spring weather don't come into play. HH"
213590,TJQ,2008-06-10 14:13:00,7806,White Bucket and one of these....  in the boat and in the camp at nite so the wifey doesnt have to go outside....  Luggable loo... from Bass Pro... the only place I could ever find them.. just need a cheap 5 gallon bucket!!  
213592,Roy,2008-06-10 14:24:00,13728,"Yeah...I got one of those, TJ. It's for DouG when he comes to visit."
213599,redfin,2008-06-10 14:39:00,79,A small porta potti and plastic rain poncho will do.
213600,Stoty,2008-06-10 14:41:00,2910, HAHAHAHAHA 
213617,jwl,2008-06-10 15:19:00,1056,"in TJ's post there, that's basically like the one I have ..except the one I have the bucket fits inside an outer shell with a lid on it..same sort of thing...different style..we use it at camp in the winter months..after October we don't have running water at the trailer because we have a lakefront lot so the water lines cannot go below the frost line to have running water in the ""off season""...having 3 dauighters and the wife, they appreciate it in the winter."
213625,blaque,2008-06-10 15:31:00,2419,"checklist never starts with..........Key in the ignition? check.........handheld GPS?check.........Tackle Bag? Check. It ALWAYS starts with ""Did you bring the Pee Cup""? The boats around us always seem closer to me than they do to her"
213630,POLLIWOGG,2008-06-10 15:45:00,835,"TIP ... If you drop the OL Lady  off on shore for a trip to the bushes provide some paper, never tell her to use a handful of leaves if she doesn't know what poison ivy looks like.  Did you know poison ivy can be a STD?"
213650,LeXXington,2008-06-10 16:50:00,1928,"Intresting topic,  When I was a very young pup and my almost wife were out canoeing we were about 2 hours out and she said ""I need too pee"" fine lets head to that island over there I said..  No she said, I need a full washroom.  I said fine, sat back feet up and said better start paddeling fast.  Funny how the island worked.  Modesty gives way too necessity."
213786,Zubris21,2008-06-10 19:42:00,563,those porta-potties are a good idea.  I'm lucky my girlfriend will hang over the gunwale or transom if it needs to be done.
213818,douG,2008-06-10 20:25:00,2693,"Let me remind the guys to use a bailer, rather than the gunwale, especially in rough water.  It's tough to swim with your pants around your knees."
213831,Reef Runner,2008-06-10 20:56:00,981," personal experience relived? lol. J/K  Note on another post, please do not mate with infectious plants for the possible spread of STDs."
213848,DanTheMan,2008-06-10 21:36:00,257,"Here's what she uses, its perfect fit and has a handle on it  "
213936,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-11 00:13:00,314,  All jokes aside.............This is a very good point.  Fishing is rated the most dangerous sport in north america and the major cause of deaths is drowning while peeing drunk  Seen that on TV not so long ago
213308,Victor,2008-06-10 00:03:00,1609,"I have been thinking about this for a while ... when I take my girlfriend out on the boat, what do I do when she needs to go to the washroom? Most of the places I know don't even have washroom on shore and when I go fish it'd be at least 4-5 hours. It's so easy for guys ... but for girls ... gee, girls are annoyin   haha i'm just joking.  What do you guys do when you take your wife/girl/mom/female friend/etc. out on your boat for a day of fishing? Do you purposely find a location where there are washrooms easily accessible on shore? I know there are also alot of female boaters/anglers on this board, please shed some light.   and.. no. telling her to hold it in would not be an option"
213310,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 00:05:00,7971,"We have a bucket, a blanket and toilet paper for the ladies on my boat.  No need for further description right?"
213311,pikehunter,2008-06-10 00:05:00,1659,"White bucket. Of course some use white buckets for other purposes, I would advise 2 in that case."
213313,Mattones,2008-06-10 00:06:00,587,''Get into your panties and take a short swim in the lake.'' But She would feel a bit weird knowing your watching or waiting for her ha just bobbing there in the water. Joking. But thats a good question.
213318,Handlebarz,2008-06-10 00:10:00,3790,Well all the ladies that have been on my boat or others I have been on have all been big enough to hang there butt over the edge of the boat with out any complaints I know alot of ladies who have done this and most are not afraid of being out in the woods either. Now if there is a city girl that needs to run to shore I dont know what I would do I am not a jerk about it but when were 8 miles out with 4 or more rods out and painer boards thats alot of work to just reel everything in to head back to shore and take a break. I did know one that could re fill a beer bottle???
213320,JohnF,2008-06-10 00:11:00,3494, That's what the ladies do on the dive boats. Sometimes modesty gives way to necessity.  JF
213321,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 00:12:00,7971, Wouldn't suggest it in November on the BOQ....hehe.
213323,forrest,2008-06-10 00:14:00,1032,Life ring + rope over side of boat to balance in the water + towel to dry off
213325,danbouck,2008-06-10 00:16:00,4380,Live well! JK  Spare Bucket goes in the boat.
213328,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 00:17:00,7971,"I'll answer for Wayne since he's not around....  He just sends them to the third deck...there's a 3 piece bathroom on his Lund.  It's right beside his 32"" wide screen fishfinder/TV"
213331,joonmoon,2008-06-10 00:20:00,528,"Use the livewell, or we just go to shore au naturel...you know like the bears....lol."
213334,Greencoachdog,2008-06-10 00:24:00,8163,"Yeah, hang it over the side... then when I think they're aboot mid way thru I like to holler SOMEBODY'S COMIN'!!!... I always get a real good chuckle outta that one!!!"
213335,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-10 00:26:00,314,Too funny!
213337,Wendel,2008-06-10 00:28:00,213,I've got a white bucket that goes on my boat. I'm going to be fitting it with an old toilet seat to make it more comfortable for the girls.
213338,danc,2008-06-10 00:29:00,4677,C'mon guys. Splurge and get the little lady on of THESE
213344,Tinman,2008-06-10 00:33:00,376,"dad has a little porta potty for my daughter to use, its on the back of his pntoonboat with a curtain that goes right the way around"
213347,JeffBornFishin,2008-06-10 00:36:00,260,Got a nice clean washroom at our marina...and a fast enough boat!  No complaints from TangledLines yet   well maybe that real rough trip back from Buckhorn last summer
213354,Rizzo,2008-06-10 00:58:00,4754,No women ever fish with me.  Did I mention I fart a lot?
213362,jwl,2008-06-10 01:10:00,1056,"if I am at my camp we are generally only about 1/2 hour at most run away from my dock so that's no big deal cuz if it's the wife and kids on the boat we aren't fishing for the whole day...funny the wife thinks fishing is boring...but will sit in the boat and do nothing, catch a tan or read a book  if we where to go out on a super long mission I have a small porya-potty we use at camp and such for the winter months when we can't have running water..it's actually just like a bucket in a shell with a small toilet seat...cost maybe 25-30 bucks..add a packet of sanitizer and Rv toilet paper and you are....no pun intended...good to go"
213363,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-10 01:11:00,3761, The hole farting thing goes for most guys i think.

213397,danc,2008-06-10 01:45:00,4677,  lol.... Thats the one..
213400,Raf,2008-06-10 01:47:00,3495,"depends.. how comfortable they are, how rough it is.. over the transom, in the livewell or the infamous white bucket."
213423,Victor,2008-06-10 02:19:00,1609,"Great replies guys  ... now I can tell my girlfriend to read this page so she knows it's not that bad of a deal lols.  I never thought of the idea of ""over the transom"" though ... haha sounds pretty cool 8-)"
