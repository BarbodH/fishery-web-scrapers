213608,redfin,2008-06-10 14:52:00,79,Great pix... I see you picked up some gold bands ... easier on your wallet eh.  Thanks for reporting.
213833,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-10 21:05:00,0,Excellent report! Looks like your getaway was a success! Congrats on the topwater Musky. I have been eyeing the top raider for quite some time. Maybe I will pick one up one day!  I think all the ONIONS kept away the racoons.LOL  I've eaten at that Texas burger many times and the food is pretty good.
