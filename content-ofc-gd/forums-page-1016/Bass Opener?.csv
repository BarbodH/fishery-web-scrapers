213186,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-09 20:11:00,2050,"awesome read - I'd rather be able to write like that than catch big giant fish any day....wellllllll......maybe not, but writing never really was my strong suit... come to think of it catching big giant fish on a regular basis isn't exactly my ""forte"" neither... I blame the writing issues on growing up bilingual.... 1 second it's french and the next it's english...  thanks for the read dude!"
213196,JohnF,2008-06-09 20:25:00,3494," There's something else I envy - anyone who's multilingual. I've had students who would apologize for their problems with English. When I asked one girl how many languages she spoke she started rattling 'em off. She could read and write four. She said she knew others but only to converse. I can order a beer (or two or three) in French, Spanish and German and that's it for my linguistic ability.  JF"
213282,Moosebunk,2008-06-09 22:58:00,3970," Yep.  Hold the bass tight for an hour until it breathes it's last breath.  Then, get to work on removing the hook from you thumb.  Or, don't use Rapala's."
213289,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 23:14:00,7971, You've seen the pics...LOL.  I tell them that I'm going to release them and that I'll do what I can to make it painless for them....no tin can....just hold the line and the vibrations from your voice are carried to the water.  They usually respond...and I give them a little extra worm just before the release.  It's a win-win situation really.
213291,JohnF,2008-06-09 23:16:00,3494," You sound just like my dentist, but he doesn't give worms.  JF"
213294,Sugarpacket,2008-06-09 23:32:00,82,BBR and I were sitting here fumin since we just had someone post a poaching report on our board good read tho!! Maybe if you fished as much as you write you would catch something big!! lol just kidding!! hope you can post that again with it being the actual thing!!!
213359,ron_o,2008-06-10 01:05:00,1,"John, Dude. Awesome storytellin'. i could visualize the entire thread. I have the same problem with fish mocking my lures but find fishing with someone experienced helps. If nothing else, you can always say 'we' caught something (or not). Cheers, Ron O"
213447,JohnF,2008-06-10 02:50:00,3494," Aw shucks, thanks. But I'm pretty sure you don't get fiction in the fish porn mags. Truth is harder to do well. My way it's just a matter of invention. That story wouldn't be nearly as good with a 10 inch smallie now, would it?  I'm going to that same pool on opening day so here's hoping that that PB is waiting for me. I'm working at erasing the hookage from the visual though.  Either way, I'll do a report, an honest one, with pics even. It's a pretty little pool in the evening, and it definitely holds bass.  JF"
213454,Greencoachdog,2008-06-10 02:59:00,8163,Bass are soooooo overrated!
213471,JohnF,2008-06-10 03:25:00,3494," Ya run what ya brung.  I know that wasn't meant to apply to fishing, but I said it anyway. Bass are what we got, or carp, or suckers, with the odd stinky little pike in the mix, just enough of them to make it tough to know whether or not to use a leader.  JF"
213013,JohnF,2008-06-09 13:28:00,3494," I go fishing. I just never catch anything but little bitty bass and sunfish. Fish hate me. They conspire to humiliate me. They mock me by spitting out my well-honed lures at my feet. Have you ever heard a fish laugh? They're nasty spiteful mean-spirited creatures at times.  That's why I go fishing alone so often - to avoid humiliation in front of my peers. The only entertaining fish stories I can recount are fictional ones, my dreams about what it might be like to really catch something. Perhaps I'll document my actual bass opener experiences and share them with y'all so you can understand the contempt fish have for me. I might even try to record their nasty snarky little bass laughter. The only consolation I get is that rare occasion when a laughing bass inhales some weedy water and chokes in mid-laugh. Then I get the last laugh on him. People worry about me then, cackling like a madman, up to my knees in dirty river water, holding my state of the art rod/reel combo, watching the nasty little beggar choke and gasp, reeling around in the stream, headbutting rocks and trees and with any kinda luck (for me) driving his little bald head smack into a concrete bridge abutment. That, sir, is the kind of satisfaction, and the only reward, I often get from fishing.  It hardly seems fair. I bend down my barbs, I practice safe C&R, I'm careful with the type of bait I use when other fish are in spawning mode - why do the durned fish hate me? I'm a lovable kinda guy. My Mom says so to everyone. I just don't get it.  JF"
213017,JohnF,2008-06-09 13:34:00,3494," Me too, but you read what happened when I tried to catch a carp - nothing. Fish just don't respect me. I'm the Rodney Dangerfield of the fish world.  JF"
213025,bpsbassman,2008-06-09 13:57:00,941,"If you pick up the dream where you left off, please be sure to post the results.  One of the best reports of what never happened."
213026,limeyangler,2008-06-09 14:00:00,5204,"that was...without a doubt...with no disrespect to others who post on here, the best post i have read in a long...long...long time  Thanks  Simon."
213033,Joey,2008-06-09 14:44:00,9122,"Jeez, you had me all the way there John.  That was pretty funny.  Joey"
213039,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 15:05:00,7971,"I was thinking the same thing about you being a dickhead....LOL.  Awesome story John....and like someone else already said...that's the best report that never happened.  I hope to read one just like it....minus the hook in your thumb, later this year."
213046,edmichit,2008-06-09 15:22:00,145,"thanks, i needed a good story."
213052,wolfville,2008-06-09 15:38:00,396,"Actually, a lot of reports may not have actually happened (exactly as written). JohnF is just being honest... and I think that's the reason he thinks he is catching less fish.  A good read, made up or real."
213054,JohnF,2008-06-09 15:42:00,3494,"Credit where credit is due. There are a number of great story tellers here in the group, each with their own style. The rest of you are fortunate in either being quality fisherpersons or adventuresome folk or both. Either way, you have something to tell. Me, I just wade the rivers and creeks, imagining what it would be like to hook into some of those trophies the rest of you actually catch. But imagining isn't the worst thing in the world, especially when it's inspired by excellent posts from Drew, 007, Solopaddler, Cliff & Bly, the Sweetener Team and so many others too numerous to list. It's just fun and I'm glad I could add a little fun to it.  I admit I was a tad alarmed when no one responded from the first 100 or so reads. I was trying to think of what I might have written to offend everyone, or had you just all decided that I was totally off the tracks.  JF"
213056,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 15:45:00,7971, I think some people didn't read it to the end and chose to bite their tongues about OOS fish.  I have to admit though....you had me going there....hehe.
213058,JohnF,2008-06-09 15:51:00,3494, I figured the header would get someone's attention. It hadn't occurred to me they might not read enough to know I was kidding. So now there are at least 100 more people who think I'm a real dickhead for targeting OOS bass.  JF
213061,SlowPoke,2008-06-09 15:58:00,2984,
213062,Roy,2008-06-09 16:00:00,13728,The subject line got my attention John. I just (till just now) decided to only open the thread after bass season had opened.
213075,JohnF,2008-06-09 16:31:00,3494, So ya think I should develop a little fish mantra to whisper as I stand in the stream? I should become a real fish whisperer.  Do fish have little ears somewhere on their bodies? I'd hate to waste a lot of time whispering sweet nothings to the wrong orifice.  JF
213078,tbayboy,2008-06-09 16:33:00,1497,"Hehe great read John, thanks for the morning chuckle."
213092,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 16:55:00,7971," I talk to fish all the time....just ask Bly....that's where I got the title ""Fish Whisperer"" that's under my avatar.  In shallow waters like tribs and areas very close to shore, I merely talk to the water.  When fishing deeper waters it is necessary to hold the line and talk...the vibrations go all the way down the line so they can hear what your saying at deeper depths.  Now you KNOW that I'm crazy....LOL."
213096,ozaibak1,2008-06-09 17:11:00,401,Well written!
213109,wuchikubo,2008-06-09 17:27:00,1114," Now Cliff, that's how you do it huh? I guess that great singing voice helps you because it sure doesn't work with my useless broken vinyl record voice of mine. Yeah, you know the kind of voice that sends people packing at the end of the night when there's Karaoke or like when my wife and kids tell me to be quite while trying to hum a tune in the car, LOL.  I guess I'll just have to record that anthem (and a great one at that) and then play it thru the braided line with a MP3 player.  Now to put the secret weapon to the test!  "
213123,JohnF,2008-06-09 18:03:00,3494, So you have like a little tin can with a hole punched in the end slid over yer line?  And I gotta ask - Do the fish whisper when they answer?  JF
213165,misfish,2008-06-09 19:35:00,29133,"I have to say,that was as if I was reading a Farley Mowat book John. Kept you hang,n on. Thanks for sharing. Yes everyone has thier own way of tell,n thier lies.LOL"
