We mainly fished a sand point on the eastern shoreline.  When we arrived there was only one other boat there and it didn't look like they were catching anything, we said we would give it a few minutes then go try elsewhere.  Well we didn't have to wait long before the first fish.     Right after he got his line back in the water he got another hit, and pulled up another nice walleye. He was using a white jig head and worm.  finally I got into the action with this fish.    Just after releasing this fish I noticed some minnows being chaced about 20ft from the boat so I told my friend to cast over towards them, as soon as the jig hit the water it was fish on.  The fish was pulling hard and taking line, eventualy the line broke.  We caught about a dozen fish all in the slot size, and missed about a dozen more.  It was pretty cool to see the walleye chasing around the baitfish.  All fish were caght with a jig and worm or a chartrouse grub in 6-8fow."

213850,Clampet,2008-06-10 21:38:00,1947,"Wow, one broke the line! Think it was a Pike? Thanks fer sharin', looks like a green/yellow slick on the water."
213851,tbayboy,2008-06-10 21:38:00,1497,Nice stuff Mike - I'll get up there one of these days.
213854,Mike01,2008-06-10 21:44:00,378,"I think it was a big 'eye that broke the line, they were in there pretty thick.  The slick is pollen."
213856,Gerritt,2008-06-10 21:45:00,6129,  Looks like pollen to me Paul.
