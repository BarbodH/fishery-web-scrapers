212670,muttfish,2008-06-08 19:21:00,20,"went to fortinos to puchase a rabbit, the thing was smaller than a little chicken but cost me 15 bucks, I've never tried rabbit but I've seen a whack recipes so I gave her a go. the end result was brutal, I floured the rabbit browned it on all sides pulled the rabbit out added some onions and carrots sauted that a little bit deglazed with some white wine added some chicken stock with some fresh herbs added the rabbit and braised it for two hours. totally tasteless and very rubbery, I'll make rabbit again but I'm not buying one, where I work there seems to be an abundance of wild rabbits so I figuse I'll start trapping them and practise my recipes if they are safe to eat. other than rabbies is there other things I should look for as far as safe eating?  another thing is at work I have started a garden and am having some trouble with cucumber beetles, I'm trying to keep it organic with no real pesticides, just wondering if anybody has any real solutions to discouraging these bugs because the marigolds I planted to combat them is not working.  just came back from pt burwell ppk, sites were great, beach was a little ???, no perch on the pier but along the beach on the park side there is a rock pier and people were catching jumbos right off the end of it.any info on the rabbits or cukes would appreciated."

212698,danbouck,2008-06-08 20:12:00,4380,Wild ones are great! But you need a trappers license to trap them.
212702,jace,2008-06-08 20:16:00,472,"you most likely overcooked it.   I don't know about eating rabbit that live in too close to city environments, personally, i would avoid them because you never know where they eat and what chemicals they're exposed to.   The first time i saw a farm rabbit at a grocery store i didn't think it was rabbit because it was so white like chicken.  Wild rabbit meat is much darker, almost liver colored compared to the stuff i saw on store shelves.  Actually, almost all wild game is darker than grocery store meats.   What i like is how small game taste different when taken in different seasons.  The flavor varies considerably depending on their diet at the time, i think you'll enjoy getting the rabbit yourself if you decide to go that way.   Tuleremia is about the only common thing to watch for.  rabbit fever.   winter is safer than summer.  It's a quick search to find info on it."

213083,tbayboy,2008-06-09 16:39:00,1497,$15!  Damn it I could brought an easy bakers dozen back from the logging road we ran down last night.  Stupid buggers were everywhere.  Next time I gotta pack a .22
213100,bigfish1965,2008-06-09 17:14:00,3382,Wow..my dogs have dispatched 5 of them so far this year..I didn't know I could have turned it into a money making adventure! I've got so many rabbits in my yard this year it is silly.
213101,TJQ,2008-06-09 17:18:00,7806,  Yup... thats the way....

213163,lookinforwalleye,2008-06-09 19:33:00,4399, I can vouch for this recipe as my wife is Maltese and there is nothing better than this recipe for cooking wabbit
213173,misfish,2008-06-09 19:43:00,29133,How big of a cube of beef??????? I will have to try this one. It seems like more of a fall/winter treat.
213181,Roy,2008-06-09 19:59:00,13728,HA! You think a $15 rabbit tastes bad? Try a $9 bass sometime and let me know.
213210,muttfish,2008-06-09 20:58:00,20,"thanks folk for the replies, man I love this forum, just wondering about my cuke problem, and just wondering is it possible to trap the little bunnies in a raccon trap, i've never snared anything in my life"
213218,misfish,2008-06-09 21:13:00,29133," Roy yer to funny,dont ya know bass are 20 bucks a pound You got a bad deal.LOL"
213273,danbouck,2008-06-09 22:37:00,4380, I don't think you are allowed to do that. Those are live release traps. I could be wrong though
213497,Sinker,2008-06-10 06:25:00,8692," Nope, your right. They're out of season, you can't snare them south of the french river, and trapping them in the city would be a big no-no. You risk getting someones pet, or a skunk etc in the trap.....and a hefty fine if you were ever caught.  Sinker"
213506,solopaddler,2008-06-10 08:56:00,8605,"Legality of trapping rabbits aside, I'm surprised no one's mentioned hasenpfeffer. With my dad being German this was something we ate fairly regularly as a kid, and I still make it now on occasion. Absolutely delicious. There's plenty of recipes on the net if you do a search..  (You can substitute skinless chicken thighs for rabbit. It's cheaper and the consistency is pretty similar.)"
213569,bassassin,2008-06-10 13:34:00,152,"Being Maltese I Can vouch for the stew, you can also fry it. But stew with hearty potatoes peas etc. is probably your best bet. Cammilj, Nice website and company ""How are you?"""
