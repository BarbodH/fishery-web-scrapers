213299,jwl,2008-06-09 23:51:00,1056,"always great to see someone get thier first..right on man  there are people that fish a lifetime and never get one,others seem to make it look easy,k it's just the start man, if ya get the bug watch out..those 20 buck a pop lures add up fast"
213343,Greencoachdog,2008-06-10 00:33:00,8163,"While everybody else was getting blistered/sunburned with bright sunshine and high temps, it looks like you were nice and cool (fleece sweater) with heavy cloud cover... and a Musky ta boot too!!!  How lucky is that???"
213356,Rizzo,2008-06-10 01:01:00,4754,Right on! And only 100 casts? You're way ahead of the game. Best news is for most people it actually gets easier from here on in (notice I said easier...not easy)
213368,Weeds,2008-06-10 01:15:00,782,"Awesome! Nice to get the first one caught and the monkey off your back (still looking for my first this year, monkey is getting heavy) then you can really enjoy the rest of the season!"
213395,Black_Blade,2008-06-10 01:44:00,258,Way to go Mike   Just the boost ya need to kick off your little tournament thats coming up..lol.  What did I tell ya guys...thats the kind of results this boy gets from shore....just imagine when he gets the hang of boat fishing!
213498,Tarzan's Jane,2008-06-10 07:24:00,1183,"Excellent Mike...congrats on your first Musky...btw, it was hard looking at your pic...you remind me of a family acquaintance who dresses like you in the heat...take some clothes OFF."
213512,Victor,2008-06-10 11:10:00,1609,Just realized i haven't posted in this one yet ... Great catch buddy! Congrats! I gotta go get my first one some day
213531,b2kptbo,2008-06-10 11:52:00,1505,"Nice one, WTG..."
212666,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-08 19:11:00,3761,Didn't catch much where we were camping so we took a trip to Lake Scugog on the way back. Fishing from the docks in town i threw out my Bucktail at least a hundred times and when i thought i was not going to get one bam i got him/or was very skinny.  From some of the Musky i have seen on here this one does not look to big but still my first BTW i used a 7' Medium heavy rod with 12lb Trilene and a steel leader.  Also here is a picture of a fat rockbass frommy brother at  campbellford on saturday.

212712,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-08 21:02:00,3761, I tried all weekend for them up in Campbellford and nothing. After about a hour i cought mine. I just brought it along the side of the dock and he hit.
