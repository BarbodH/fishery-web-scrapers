213073,Headhunter,2008-06-09 16:29:00,5703,"Hey Guys/gals! I have finally been able to clear up some time in August, for a one week family vacation to somewhere in our fine province! We have two young'ins, 6 and 4 and my wife and I are looking for a kid friendly place, within 3-4 hours of Toronto, that will be accommodating to my kids needs, (beach, dock etc...) and my desire to get them out in a boat, catch pan fish, swim etc... . This will be our first family trip to ""the north"" as we have historically played at the beach on Lake Huron. I could use some suggestions, from those of you who have been or are currently in the same boat as me... not looking for really high end, just your typical cottage, where I won't have to worry too much about an unforgiving shore line, where the kids may get hurt, playing. I am open to any and all suggestions and appreciate you time spent in responding! HH"
213081,Wendel,2008-06-09 16:36:00,213,"http://www.goldeneaglecamp.com/  This place is a little further, about a 5 hour drive,  but they have a huge waterslide that never get's boring for kids.  We are going up there again this year, the third time!!!  Everything is pretty good up there, nice docks, nice things for the family.  Some nice fishing to."

213157,bpsbassman,2008-06-09 19:21:00,941,"Memquisit Lodge on the West Arm (just a mile up from Lakair).  Not sure about the beach, but the cottages are exceptionally clean.  Also have a workout room, a bit of a spa for the ladies.  And the fishing can be exceptional. Memquisit Be sure to download their pdf file.  Very informative."

213613,fishnsled,2008-06-10 14:59:00,3520,Have a look here HH.  I was up there this past winter and it was very nice.  Viamede
213642,Pigeontroller,2008-06-10 16:12:00,2793,"I would also recomend Scotsmans Point, near Buckhorn, on Upper Buckhorn Lake."
213671,bow slayer,2008-06-10 17:27:00,1074,"check this out  http://www.duenorth.net/martinscamp/   It is about 3 hours north of Toronto,great fishing,great beach, lots of water to boat on and explore. Best part is very uncrowded unlike similar lakes further south. Nice relaxing area lots of crown land,canoe routes and back land camping.  You can fish some of the smaller lakes in the area and have it to yourself."
213701,icefisherman,2008-06-10 18:05:00,952,"One word Joe - ALGONQUIN!!!  Within your travel time, plenty of choice in level of remoteness...great beaches and top fishing as well. We go there every summer with my now 3 year old son. It'll be our third time now in August, so we can meet there too I'd recommend Opeongo as you can take your boat or canoe in the interior sites (still no portaging) and I can tell you a place with a whole private beach/bay for yourself, all sand and shallow...great for kids to play and 2 min away from top lake trout and bass fishing spots. Let me know if you want specifics.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
213704,kemper,2008-06-10 18:07:00,2232,  Did I meet you up there last summer?  Ill be up from the 12th until the 19th
