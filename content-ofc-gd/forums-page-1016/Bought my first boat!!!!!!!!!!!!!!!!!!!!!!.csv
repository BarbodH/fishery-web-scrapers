213784,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 19:41:00,7971,Attaboy Victor!  She looks like a fine fishing vessel!!!
213580,Victor,2008-06-10 13:51:00,1609,"As much as I love carp fishing, I target other species as well and I have always dreamed to own a boat. Last year when I went to BPS I was chatting with Roger (BPSBASSMAN) and he gave me a piece of advice, ""You have to buy a boat before you get married!"". I'm not getting married quite yet but I have decided to take that advice and started saving up. After months of researching on craiglist/buysell/kijiji/classifieds I found the one for me . Here she is ...       It's an older 14' tinny (unknown make) with a side console 1986 20hp Evinrude. The previous owner has already put in a deck, carpetted everything. It has bilge pump, nav. lights, 2 seats, some storage and rod holders made out of PVC pipes. It also has a 40lb Minn Kota PowerDrive in the front. Dropped by BPS again and picked up a pair of saltys for trolling, going to put the fishfinder I used on my canoe on her as well. Roger has kindly offered to give me a livewell pump that he doesn't use anymore so I might also setup a small livewell. I already have a boat safety kit, oars, anchor, pfds. Anything else that i need guys? (O yeah i gotta get myself an OFC decal too) Should I be worried about the boat seats being too high affecting the centre of gravity?  I went to register my trailer yesterday, gotta get the boat also licensed and pick up a cranking battery for the motor before heading out for her maiden voyage this saturday. I just can't wait, hope to get her slimed up soon.  Special thanks to boatman, kevin and BPSBASSMAN for all the help and advice you have given me. Very knowledgable guys who are always willing to answer some questions for the newbies.  Edit: I forgot to add ... she'll be named ""girlfriend #2"""
213591,wolfville,2008-06-10 14:14:00,396,"Congratulations, buddy. I'm sure you're gonna have lots of fun with the boat.  I'm sure you'll catch something in that boat... not like last Friday when... (just joking)"
213593,fishnsled,2008-06-10 14:28:00,3520,"Congrats on the new ride.  The style of the boat looks similar to my old Sterling I had but not sure.  As for the seats, when fishing on calm days you should be fine.  Just use some caution because it will be a bit unstable do to the size of the boat.  For running down the lake and rough conditions, even trolling, I'd want the seat closer to the floor.  I'd also invest in a set of proper seat pedestals.  Those office chair bases look like they'd guarantee you a trip into the lake at some point in time. Now fix it up and go get some fish."
213594,oxcowboy,2008-06-10 14:31:00,544,"congrats,  your gonna love it.   have fun and be careful out there.  jason"
213595,tbayboy,2008-06-10 14:31:00,1497,"Congrats Victor, sure it'll be slimed in no time."
213596,Jay T,2008-06-10 14:37:00,282,"Congrats on the boat, hope you get her slimed soon. I agree with fishnsled get pedistal for that seat, or you or someone else could take a dip."
213598,BFSC Kevin,2008-06-10 14:38:00,1351,congrats on the boat man!  where ya heading to this sat?
213604,redfin,2008-06-10 14:44:00,79,Congrats!  Perhaps a pair of brackets to guide the boat back on the trailer make it easier on a windy day.
213607,Roy,2008-06-10 14:49:00,13728,"Way to go, Victor. Have fun, catch lots and stay safe out there."
213609,Meely,2008-06-10 14:54:00,282,Nice Ride !!! I remember my first boat.....ahhh....the memories...... Enjoy !!   Meely
213611,Bitsmith2k,2008-06-10 14:55:00,396,congrats on the ride! dont include tbayboy in your plans for the maiden voyage.. he's real bad luck  joking sean
213612,Black_Blade,2008-06-10 14:58:00,258,"Cool ride!  Just the kind of thing I will be moving up to in hopefully the near future.  Half the fun is working on her and tweaking things, when you can't get out on the water (instead of going thru the tackleboxes and polishing and reorganizing....   naawww no obsession here )"
213621,jwl,2008-06-10 15:22:00,1056,"hope the boat brings you tonnes of fun this season,I am sure once you get out in it a few times you will decide a few things here and there to set it up ""your way"" that will be half the fun....have a safe summer on the water"
213623,Wendel,2008-06-10 15:27:00,213,"I'm sure you will get a lot of use out of that boat. I just sold my old boat this week, and even though I have a new one, it still almost brought a tear to my eye seeing her go. Good luck with it, you are well armed to take on some big fish now!!!"
213626,Minnow,2008-06-10 15:35:00,177,"Congrats on the new boat! Always exciting to get a new boat especially your first, nice boat enjoy it!"
213631,bpsbassman,2008-06-10 15:46:00,941,"Way to go Victor!  She's a beauty!!! A couple of things: You're gonna love your boat and the better access to the fish.  Lots of memories are going to made in that boat.  Now you can go fishing for real fish!!  jk All you have to do now is solve your ladies washroom problem  Here's a picture of my first ride.  My buddy bought it from me and three boats later, my first one is still going strong.  Still have fond memories of her "
213639,idesign,2008-06-10 16:02:00,149,congratulation on u r new boat.do u mind telling how much did it cost you.thx
213649,jdmls,2008-06-10 16:48:00,575,"""Get it before your married"" is probably the best advise anyone could of given you  on buying a boat!!! Nice rig...the console is a must on any boat in my eyes. You can only last so long out on the water with a tiller before your shoulder is sore !!...this will be one summer you will never forget forsure !!"
213694,lew,2008-06-10 17:53:00,12767,WTG Victor and congrats on the new boat !!  You'll find a whole new world of fishing now that your no longer shorebound.  My 1st boat was a 6' wooden punt with a 3 hp RUDE
213697,Joey,2008-06-10 17:59:00,9122,"That's great Victor, congrats bud  I remember our first tinny, it was alot of fun.  Joey"
213700,sharper,2008-06-10 18:04:00,279,Nice boat Vic! Looks like there is room on the deck to set up some pods too lol.
213702,kemper,2008-06-10 18:06:00,2232,"Looks awesome Victor, if you are ever interested into gettin into some bass on Buckhorn let me know. I know where you can launch and park for free. Heck...I can even be an alright guide...hint...hint"
213705,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-10 18:07:00,0,Congrats on your new ride! You have entered a whole new fishing world now!!!
213741,ehg,2008-06-10 18:50:00,2666,"You will love the boat! It will last a long time as well. My first 12ft. /w 9.9 lasted 25 yrs before it got too leaky.  Try to get some lake depth maps( Adventure Maps are good) for a start, paired with your depthfinder, you could find excellent fishing on 10- 15 ft reefs through the Kawarthas this summer.  Like others said, you definitely should lower or remove the seats, and get some nice cushy flotation/ seating pads anyways.  Have fun, ehg"
213743,jace,2008-06-10 18:53:00,472,"    this advice is hillarious to me because a friend got married about a year ago and he did just that and a lot more.  He upgraded his pickup for a  new ford super duty, sold his bassboat and got a Skeeter with a 225HP, traded and upgraded a honda crotch rocket, and bought a new 4 wheeler.  He figured that the days of new toys are over once he got married...and he was right.   He hasn't been able to get anything since then."
