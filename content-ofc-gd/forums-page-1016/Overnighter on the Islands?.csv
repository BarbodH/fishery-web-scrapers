I love fishing at night for carp but there seems to be an increasing trend for pay parking and night closures at the parks where I fish in the GTA – Plus the rising price of gas doesn’t help either.  Is it legal to stay overnight on the islands?  I imagine beyond the residents who live there, raccoons and mosquitoes would probably be the only things out during the night (hopefully).  There are a few swims on the islands that look absolutely mint for 2am fishing.  Any info is much appreciated  Thanks"

214007,BabyHerc,2008-06-11 02:11:00,285,I've done it.  Beware of fire ants.  There are TONNES.  And keep something close at hand... I've encountered some very shady individuals many times down there.
