596521,Fishnwire,2011-06-25 11:14:00,983,"What an employer is really asking for when they state they want someone who is ""fluently bilingual"", is someone who has a french background.  I would bet dollars to doughnuts that the person in charge of making hiring decisions is French himself, and simply prefers to employ his ""own kind"".  Try getting a job in Ontario in the logging/lumber industry if you're not French...good luck."
