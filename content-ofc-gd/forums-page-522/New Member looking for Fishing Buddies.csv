596456,kvazipecaros,2011-06-25 01:56:00,4," Hha thanks everyone! I like pictures too, so I will make sure to take a lot. In the meantime, you guys can visit jezerojoca.com or jocalake.com and check out some pictures. I used to fish there...some MONSTER pike and wild powerful carp.  Serbian:  Hvala! deluje mi do jaja za sad. Dozvolu sam platio 25 dolara i hvatacu ribu, a u srbiji za 60 dolara mozes samo da se hvatas za onu stvar!"
