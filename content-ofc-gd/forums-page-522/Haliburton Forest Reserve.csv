I checked the website and it says that a 8 lb smallmouth was caught in one of the lakes, years ago.  We have been going up to Haliburton area for many years but never went into the HF for fishing , they charge $15/PERSON so I never really considered it, but would like to hear if anyone has been  ... it maybe worth a try at least once if the fishing is good."

596334,Jds63,2011-06-24 18:23:00,1365,"I agree the bass fishing is good in the other lakes i have fished in Haliburton area but since I have never been in the Haliburton Forest I was just wondering if anyone had any stories or thoughts on the private park. We have property up in that area , we have been to the wolf centre but thats it ... hope to one day build a little cabin/cottage up there  ..."
