596815,Jer,2011-06-26 12:00:00,1426,"   Obviously, you would rather have it that nobody owns any guns at all, as they are all equally dangerous."

I see more dangerous people with keys driving the highways."

Do you have any concept of the power of 12ga in a small space?  How about all Centre fire rifles, i can easily hit a man sized target at 500 yards, where do you draw the line exactly?  O wait you don't, you like most other ignorant people choose to ban rifle ""A"" because it looks more dangerous than ""B"" when it simply is not, that surely sounds a rational thought process.  Then you accuse completely rational people of being gun crazy simply because they are intelligent enough to know the reality, you are embarrassing yourself.  For the record, i don't even own a semi auto .22, and have no interest in owning an ar or ak, but that doesn't mean i think one is more dangerous than the other, that would be completely childish and foolish."

If someone points a starter's pistol at me...I'm not going to get too worried because most starter's pistols look like starter's pistols.  On the other hand, if someone points an AK at me...I have no way of knowing whether or not it's operable so I'll assume it is.  So would you.  I sincerely hope (and am confident that) everyone who wants to responsibly enjoy hunting and target shooting in this country will always be free to do so.  However, when I hear people get bent out of shape over loosing and item such as an AK-47...you'll understand if I (and most people) are not overly sympathetic."

596258,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-24 14:45:00,10439, Exactly!!! And don't be surprised that if you point a starters pistol at someone you end up getting shot in self defense either. A starters pistol can still be a deadly weapon especially if it is discharged close to someone. They may shoot blanks but the escaping gas when they are fired still packs a punch. Also I have seen starters pistols that could be mistaken for a 38.
596259,fishing n autograph,2011-06-24 14:51:00,2540,"Keep and mind, if you bore out the barrel suddenly you have a firearm  Pointing a firearm and possessing one are two different thing"

596337,fishing n autograph,2011-06-24 18:41:00,2540,And go figure the ar-15 is prohibited but the ar-10 isn't....
596343,TennesseeGuy,2011-06-24 19:11:00,957,"I had the pleasure of firing an AR15 on the range last week.  It's impressive.  There was a run on AR15s after our November 2008 election.  Prices climbed as demand increased.  The M1 Garand has become a popular item recently.  Good ones are hard to come by.  The U.S. attempted to buy back quite a few from South Korea, but the deal was halted by ""our"" side.  Those suckers will reach out, with accuracy.  I was assigned an M1 Garand in 1954 and told I'd have to cough up $70 if I lost it."
596389,porkpie,2011-06-24 21:59:00,2521,"An AK47 is a prohibited firearm in Canada, if you owned one at the time the legislation was passed, you could keep it and buy others.  Otherwise, your outta luck.  An AR15 is NOT a prohibited weapon in Canada, it is merely restricted, and relegated to range use only!  Anyone can pass their restricted test, get a restricted PAL and purchase an AR15.  Not so much with the AK!"

596486,blarg,2011-06-25 03:26:00,289,"  If you knew anything about firearms you would know that there are many legally available arms that are in the same class as an ak-47 you would also know that some are illegal or restricted simply because they look a certain way despite firing the same ammunition as many non restricted firearms.  If you knew those things and no doubt many other things that you don't you wouldn't make such ignorant and flippant remarks.  Maybe you should consider your obvious lack of knowledge before you make comments on the subject.  Perhaps the most problematic part of any firearms discussion are people with opinions and little to no real knowledge.  Questions, how many people have been shot with an Ak-47 in Canada?  How many people have been shot with a mini-14? Which one of those is prohibited and which one is unrestricted?  This is so tiresome."

596515,Fishnwire,2011-06-25 10:55:00,983,"  Then it seems to me that the problem is that a bunch of weapons as dangerous (or more dangerous) as AKs should also be made illegal...not that we should make AKs legal, as you seem to be suggesting.  I clearly don't know as much about firearms as you do.  The thing is...I don't have to know very much to know that an AK-47 is something that should be prohibited.  It is an AK-47, right?  Like most Canadians...AK-47 is all I need to hear to make up my mind."
596517,Fishnwire,2011-06-25 10:56:00,983,"   So I'm a ""total ass"" because I'd prefer my neighbor not own an AK-47 and have no sympathy for someone whining about losing one?  It seems to me if you can't comprehend how and why the average Canadian feels exactly the way I do...you're the total ass, and a ""gun-nut"" in the true sense of the word.  Nobody needs to own a Kalashnikov or similar assault rifle.  Good luck convincing any clear thinking individual otherwise.  That's the way it is in this country and it's not going to change anytime soon.  You don't have to like it, but since the majority want it that way, you'll have to live with it.  If you think more than a small fraction of the country would support your right to own an AK-47...you're out of touch."
596523,Jer,2011-06-25 11:19:00,1426,"What is it, in your mind, that makes an AK-47 more dangerous than most other hunting rifles out there. You do realize we're not talking ""fully automatic machine guns"" here, right?  Is it just the name? Watching too many Hollywood movies?  Any gun is just as dangerous as any other if handled improperly.  So you're OK with your neighbour owning all sorts of other ""legal"" guns, but you hear ""AK-47"" and you run for the hills?"

If you had to have a fight to the death with someone, would you think it would be fair for you to have a candlestick and your opponent an AK-47?  Of course not, because you know a candlestick is no where near as deadly as an AK-47.  If the difference between a candlestick and an AK-47 is nothing more than ""hype""...why not give up the AK and go buy a candlestick and be happy with it?  Oh that's right...a candlestick is nowhere near an effective a weapon as an AK...and people who want AKs want effective weapons...not a decorative place to stick a candle.  Like I said...you guys think what you want and blame ""Hollywood movies"" as much as you like...the fact is (and thank God) that the majority of Canadians are not going to get on board with you getting to own an AK-47.  Those who have suggested other less infamous weapons are equally dangerous yet legal are certainly right and only point out the need to prohibit those items as well.  You want to own an AK-47?  Then go to the Rwanda and join up with a gang of warlords...here in the civilized world we don't go in for that."

I know the act all to well and I'll share, what I shared with Dave by PM, right here. My father in law was one of the first they tried to make an example of.......  My f-in-law was one of the very first that was arrested under the new laws... handcuffed in front of our 125 employees at the plastic plant.. thrown in a police car. I then sat and watched the OPP, with search warrant, drag his 50+ rifles by the straps across his laneway pavement and bang them off the LTD bumper as they tossed them in the trunk. Mother-in-law..... during their divorce... called ""fearing for her life"", didn't even live in the same damn house. The police had to go thru a rot iron fence gate.. past 2 trained attack King Sheppard dogs.. locked front door.. alarm system.. locked door to the basement.. locked door to the furnace room where the guns were all wrapped in blankets and taped together with reinforced tape after he moved out of the matramonial house into the one they grabbed the guns from. M-in-law had bought everyone one of these guns for him. One for his birthday.. one for Christmas every year that they'd been married.. 26 years = 52 guns.  Charged with improper storage of firearms and possession of a restricted weapon. The 53rd gun, an AK47, I signed for off the purolator truck one day at the plant, that he ordered out of Montreal just for s hi ts and giggles. Not a single bullet anywhere in the same storage room and as matter fact they never found a single bullet doing their search.  I had to post 2 million dollars in securities to bail him out of jail and it cost him $75,000 in legal fees to get cleared of all charges. He got all his guns back except they somehow lost his AK.... two constables got demoted to desk jobs (but I now know one is the commander in Parry Sound a decade+ later).

We lost countless contracts as well, thanks to the OPP smearing his name and pictures of the guns all over the papers and TV. They kept saying they couldn't find ammo for the AK to see if it had been modified to automatic (check with your swat team for.... sakes ). He'd still be in jail to this day, if he hadn't used Bernie Cogulman(sp) as a lawyer whom is now a supreme court judge. He should have been awarded court costs and he didnt' even get that.  Even with all charges dropped (he can cross the border every day if he wants to, so I know it's true.. he winters in Florida) he was told he wasn't allowed to possess a firearm for 5 years, so had to find someone with an FAC to take possession of them.

What is considered to be a firearm for purposes of the Firearms Act and for offences related to the Firearms Act in the Criminal Code?  A4. As set out in the Firearms Act, ""firearm"" means:  a barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet or other projectile can be discharged and that is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person, and includes any frame or receiver of such a barrelled weapon, as well as anything that can be adapted for use as a firearm.  Following are some weapons and devices that meet the definition of a firearm but that are deemed not to be firearms for purposes of the Firearms Act and related offences in the Criminal Code. Some of these items are exempted from the definition only if they were designed exclusively for a specific purpose and are intended to be used exclusively for that purpose by the person who possesses it. However, all of the items listed below are considered to be firearms if used in a criminal or negligent manner.  Antique firearms; Devices designed exclusively for signalling, for notifying of distress, for firing blank cartridges or for firing stud cartridges, explosive-driven rivets or other industrial projectiles; Shooting devices designed exclusively forslaughtering domestic animals, tranquilizing animals, or discharging projectiles with lines attached to them; Air guns and other barreled weapons designed to have: A muzzle velocity of 152.4 meters per second or less and/or A muzzle energy of 5.7 joules or less.  http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/faq/index-eng.htm  2. Air guns that meet the Criminal Code definition of a firearm, but that are deemed not to be firearms for certain purposes of the Firearms Act and Criminal Code.  These are air guns with a maximum muzzle velocity of 152.4 meters or 500 feet per second and/or a maximum muzzle energy of 5.7 joules or 4.2 foot pounds.  Such air guns are exempt from licensing, registration, and other requirements under the Firearms Act, and from penalties set out in the Criminal Code for possessing a firearm without a valid licence or registration certificate. However, they are considered to be firearms under the Criminal Code if they are used to commit a crime. Anyone who uses such an air gun to commit a crime faces the same penalties as someone who uses a regular firearm.  The simple possession, acquisition and use of these air guns for lawful purposes is regulated more by provincial and municipal laws and by-laws than by federal law. For example, some provinces may have set a minimum age for acquiring such an air gun. For more information, please contact your local or provincial authorities. These air guns are exempt from the specific safe storage, transportation and handling requirements set out in the regulations supporting the Firearms Act. However, the Criminal Code requires that reasonable precautions be taken to use, carry, handle, store, transport, and shipped them in a safe and secure manner.  http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/air_gun-arme_air-eng.htm"
