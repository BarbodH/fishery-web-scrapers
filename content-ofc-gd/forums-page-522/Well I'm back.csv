596582,thebigcatch,2011-06-25 15:28:00,138,  This was lodge # 2 for me the 1st one was good I was the #1 guide there and still could have been the now one was a Joke the boss was an ass and the terrible living conditions but the $ was good... I just told myself I'll come home and do tournaments and have a fun summer  What lodge did you work at?
