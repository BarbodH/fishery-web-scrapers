I want to put a post by the pool with a plug in it (also with a GFI)and I have one outside already a short distance away that I wanted to run it from..I think the pool pump needs 12/2 wire? but 14/2 would work I'm guessing..  thanks

Any other plug had to be like 10 feet from the pool.  The electrical inspector that came out to inspect the work gave us some reasons for it, and they made sense to me! Set a plug in radio on the top rail of a pool? On a wet pool deck?"
