596377,Handlebarz,2011-06-24 21:01:00,3790,I have a Garmin nuvi 250w and the maps are from 2008 I was wondering how I update it? are there free ones out there? The update I found for it was $99 heck you can almost get a new one for that and the new ones I was looking at gave you a lot more info then this old one.  Thanks for the hepl
596378,Terry,2011-06-24 21:09:00,14456,looks to me there is software updates but no free map update  S.O.L. seems to the case
596440,John,2011-06-25 01:00:00,2956,Mike I have an older nuvi as well and refused to pay for the map updates. Going to buy a new model either over the internet or next time I am in the US. Many have free map updates now.
596457,Handlebarz,2011-06-25 02:01:00,3790,I was thinking the same things as for the $50 more I think a new one might be in order
