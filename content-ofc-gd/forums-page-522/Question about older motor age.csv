596321,Tootsie II,2011-06-24 17:51:00,162,"Just purchased a reconditioned older small horsepower Johnson outboard for a kicker. Runs good in my tank! Vendor did not know its age and I wouldn't mind having a ballpark figure on it. It's an older Johnson Sea-Horse with the olive green shaft, white prop and white top cowling. The starting rope handle is on the right side of the front face of the cowling. There is a bottom  red/orange colour band and top black band along both sides of the cowling. Could any of you more mature members out there possibly give a time period when Johnson was using this colour scheme. Thanks."
596322,BITEME,2011-06-24 17:59:00,1968, look for the serial number and run it on line
596326,Spiel,2011-06-24 18:04:00,9065, That would do it. But from the description it sounds like my mid 70's model.
596338,Uncle Buck,2011-06-24 18:45:00,1000,"check for a button stamped in/attached to the engine block...  it should have a model# there, then cross reference it..."
596345,DanD,2011-06-24 19:18:00,2223,This one is a 1972 Johnson 3hp.   
596346,porkpie,2011-06-24 19:24:00,2521,"From description and colors, you have a late 70's model."
596428,Weeds,2011-06-25 00:29:00,782,"I've got a 76 6hp johnson; colour scheme sounds the same, more or less."
596453,Woodsman,2011-06-25 01:33:00,1286,Forget the serial # it's the model # you need. It should be on the plate attached to the bracket that clamps to the transom(serial # also on this plate). It should be something like this(CDL-25 or 9RL-70). Post it here & you should get your answer.  Rick

596566,Tootsie II,2011-06-25 14:23:00,162,"Thanks for all your help guys, it's a 1974."
