Mostly tube jigs did the trick.  Apparently, if you ask around up there there are some trout pen just floating around.  I was told you fish near them with shrimp and can do quite well. Good luck!"

596973,Eazy,2011-06-27 00:03:00,260,"Predominat species for me were smallmouth bass and Pike, prefered bait was the X-Rap in the Ghost color or Olive......fished mostly shallow water structure, weed beds, rock piles etc. Didn't hit up any open water as that place has literally thousands of islands, bays and channels. Also brought the Garmin just so I wouldn't get lost!"
