596528,danklegrand,2011-06-25 11:34:00,55,"Just picked up a set of used Big Jon manual riggers for a great deal!  I don't have a lot of experience with controlled depth fishing, but both my Dad and my girlfriend's Dad have spend a lot of time doing it years ago. Anyways, I thought I's expand our horizons a bit and gradually get into it. I have a question about the cannonball colour.  The ones I got with my riggers are pretty beat up and most of the paint is chipped off.  I cleaned then up and was planning on re-painting, but I'm unsure which colour I should go with.  They were originally red...  Most of the new ones seem to come in either black or natural? Is cannonball colour just a personal preference?  Do they actually help attract fish to your lure? Any advice, personal opinions, myths or legends are welcome!"
596529,danklegrand,2011-06-25 11:35:00,55,P.s. I'll add photos when I get them mounted on my boat.
596552,green&orange,2011-06-25 12:53:00,31,"  Just paint them black or leave them natural and call it good.  Just from my experiences, but I am no pro so take it for what it is worth.  There are other things that are more important while downrigger fishing IMO like lead lenghts, release types, the weight of the ball, etc.  Good luck."

596569,Burtess,2011-06-25 14:35:00,901,"The colour of the ball is really irrelevant as red disappears at around 15ft and orange at around 25ft, the ball would appear a shade of black below that...  Burt"

596639,Roy,2011-06-25 20:16:00,13728,No difference at all. In fact I'm convinced they started painting them to hide defects. Although the ones that are painted with the vinyl might be a little less noisy when you're reeling your balls in....as it were.
596667,danklegrand,2011-06-25 23:06:00,55,"Thanks for the replies guys!  Again, I'm a bit of a newbie to the downrigging side of things and had heard different opinions about the colour of the cannonballs.  I think the ones I got are home-made, and I'd guess they weigh about 8lbs...  One thing that I haven't got yet are the releases.  I'll search around on here, but does anyone have preferences on what to buy?  Thanks again."
596884,camillj,2011-06-26 18:16:00,1988,I like em red because you can seem them sooner coming up... not sure the fish care either way. But judging by the teath marks I'd say they like red too
596996,Kerry,2011-06-27 00:57:00,383, The Scotty pinch type are adjustable and easy to use.I would stick to mono with a flourocarbon leader of 5-8 ft.If you use a cheater or slider a larger swivel on the flouro will kind of help keep the lines from getting too tangled up when bringing lines up.Braided line doesn't work all that great with releases especially if you like to crank them down.
