595078,Mike Pike,2011-06-21 17:33:00,1332,"After seeing the recent trib fishig posts, I decided to burn a vacation day yesterday to hit an trib down Erie way.  I already visited the stream a few weeks ago and found it blown, so I was pretty happy to see it back to normal when I arrived yesterday morning.  Once the Steelhead leave for the lake so do most of the fisherman, so I had the little jewel all to myself.   I found that I was getting hung up bottom bouncing no matter how light the split-shot, so I switch up to a small spinner to keep my presentation higher in the water column.  No takers though, unless you count the rock bass and chub.  Moved on and found a deeper run where I could present my crawler with a slip float, and that's where I found the first little Brown of the day.  The run held several more Browns and couple of Bows so my morning was an enjoyable one.  Here's some Brownie shots.       Once things slowed, I took the slip float back to some of the other runs I had tried earlier in the morning with no success and hooked into the best Rainbow of the day.   A really great way to spend the morning.  I find I get the most enjoyment when I get back to the basics and pack the hipwaders, vest, a few lures and ultra-light rod.  Cheers!"

595108,grimsbylander,2011-06-21 19:37:00,3016,Very nice! Is there a more beautiful fish than a natural brownie? Congrats  Dave
595184,soggey,2011-06-22 00:12:00,20,Always nice to flip a creek for a day
595195,FrankTheRabbit,2011-06-22 00:29:00,479,Nice lookin fish! I miss fishing with my float gear.
595334,Leecher,2011-06-22 14:32:00,7832,Nicely done Mike That first pic.... is very inviting Thanks for sharing your day off with us Leechman
595336,fishnsled,2011-06-22 14:36:00,3520,Seeing this makes me want to breakout the 4wt cane rod. Some nice fish!!
595353,Dr. Hook,2011-06-22 14:54:00,18,"Wow, very nice. Nothing better than being by yourself on a trout stream. I havn't done this in years, its been way too long. Not having to deal with the hassle of the boat would be a nice change."
595508,Danubian,2011-06-22 21:39:00,65,"Awesome catches Mike, congratulations!  I haven't had too much luck on catching ""brownies"" - perhaps the usual streams I fish don't hold many resident trout, or it's just me. I would like to try new places, scout in the unknown... If I can ask a favor, do you mind PM-ing me an approximate location tip?  I'll reciprocate...  Danubian"
595513,BillM,2011-06-22 21:48:00,17367," Pick a southern shore Lake E trib that's stocked with brownies..  All kinds of them are in the US.   Not so much up here.  I'm assuming when the OP stated 'Erie' he meant the town, not the lake"
596919,ehg,2011-06-26 20:41:00,2666,Nice browns and bows  It is the best when the crowds disperse.
596998,MJL,2011-06-27 01:07:00,2427,Sweet brownies Mike  It's been over a month since I last caught a trout...Very tempted to hit up some spring fed creeks for some after reading this report.
