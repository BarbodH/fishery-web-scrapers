596067,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-24 02:37:00,4399,I would think a circle type hook would be better!
596165,Weeds,2011-06-24 10:33:00,782,I'm no pro but I'm pretty sure they work fine for wacky rigging.
596199,Lunker777,2011-06-24 12:47:00,866,"you CAN use any type of hook for wacky rigging.... YES  Are they best suited for the technique ? NO....  I generally use a finesse, or a small circle hook... 1/0 or so..."
596235,Garry2Rs,2011-06-24 13:59:00,1425,"I like 3/0 EWG hooks for wacky rigging, providing that the water isn't too weedy.  If there are a lot of weeds I use a cheap red Mustad weedless hook.  The ones I buy are red and have a ewg bend.  I buy the 1/0 or 2/0 size at Wal-Mart or CTC.  In my opinion, most people miss a lot of hits with small ""wacky"" type hooks.  If we catch bass on EWG when the worm is hooked north-south, why do we want a smaller hook when it's hooked east-west?  Wacky hooks and drop-shot sinkers are two examples of the tackle makers trying to get a piece of the action by bring out special, technique-specific, hooks and sinkers. Sometimes these items are helpful, but mostly they are just another way of picking the anglers pocket."

596616,crossover,2011-06-25 18:29:00,172,"Thanks, I was only wondering if the little bend by the eye would kill any of the action or somehow mess up hook ups."
596630,335396,2011-06-25 19:30:00,16,"Good for wacky but the weed guard is not so strong to hold in place. Also could be a good hook for drop shot for small soft bait. Yes, hold fish for ever."
