Say i caught 3 bass and I want to take home to eat, and on my way home, my friend/relative/girlfriend/neighbour or whatever calls and asks me for a fish for dinner, am I allowed to give them the whole fish or does it have to be prepared at my house and I could only invite them to have their share?  and of course, this is assuming the person does not have a fishing license"
596980,gaspumper,2011-06-27 00:18:00,393,You can give fish to friend-neighbor or whoever but it still counts toward your daily and or possession limit.
