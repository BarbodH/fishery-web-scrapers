596249,LucG,2011-06-24 14:27:00,779,I sometimes hear that a good way to understand how you bait moves under water is to throw it around in your swimming pool.  I was just wondering if chlorine would have any negative effects to my baits and line or even leave a chlorine scent.

596260,bigmac1984,2011-06-24 14:53:00,193,"I test them in my pool too, and whenever I'm worried about the lure having a weird taste, I spray it with some scent like Gulp Alive or something similar."
596277,Live2fish85,2011-06-24 15:43:00,1633,As Roy said the chlorine shouldn't affect the lures at all just make sure you rinse them off after. Only way the chlorine will wreck the lures is if you leave it in there. Thank god my pool is Lake Erie.
