596782,justin elia,2011-06-26 03:21:00,151,"Just a quick report from last week.  I went out with with a friend last Wednesday morning, decided to sleep in a bit and start a little later than usual.  We had lines down at 7:30 and within 20 minutes we had 3 hits.  One rip on the dipsy.....no one home.  One knock off and then first fish of the season.  These fish were full of piss and vinegar, very surprising for fish around the 20lb mark.  Great fights, good times and its just what the doctor ordered.          We fished until noon and went 6/11 with 3 knock offs, 2 dropped fish, 4 Chinnies , 1 Rainbow and 1 Atlantic.    Details - We fished from 70-120 feet, best depth was 20-40 down in 70-80 fow in front of the cement plant.  It was a spoon bite today, all but one hit came on spoons.  Best spoon of th day was the famous lemon-lime pro king which by far has produced more kings in my boat than any other spoon.  "
