596874,BASSKILLA19,2011-06-26 17:09:00,9,Hey guys just looking for your opinion on this. A buddy of mine is stuck between two lines Suffix 832 20lb and 10lb.He has a shimano symetre reel and hes going to be fishing for bass and muskie this summer. So if you could help that would be greatly appreciated
596879,OutdoorDan,2011-06-26 17:32:00,325,"You need completely different lines for bass and muskie, 20lb for muskie is way to low. I would go 10lb test line for bass."
596936,davey buoy,2011-06-26 22:20:00,5505,"IMO i'd go with 30 /8 braid with a 12-18"" steel leader for muskie. You need the leader for their teeth."
596941,BillM,2011-06-26 22:33:00,17367, 65-80lb PPro and 130lb flouro leaders for muskie.  There is no point in messing around with line/terminal tackle that isn't up to the task.
596954,daryl0815,2011-06-26 23:17:00,225,"For Bass either 10 or 20 will do just fine, I use 20 usually on a medium action rod with my 2500 series reel.  I would tell your friend to invest in a heavier duty rig for the Musky, maybe a solid baitcasting rig and go with at least 50lb test and leaders. You don't want to mess around too much with light gear. I use a heavy action Shimano Beastmaster rod and a big Calcutta reel and it works well.  Musky can be a fragile fish and you want to get them in as fast as possible and avoid long fights on light gear.  Daryl"
