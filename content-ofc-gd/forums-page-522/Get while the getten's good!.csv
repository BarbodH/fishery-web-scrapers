596298,crappieperchhunter,2011-06-24 16:30:00,2582,  Yeah it is a 6 I forgot that. Back in the day we used to long line for spring lakers and I got the 6 because it held a million yards of line
595824,Harrison,2011-06-23 19:32:00,2202,I have 3 already or I'd grab this one.  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-home-garden-Fishing-reel-ZEBCO-CARDINAL-4-Spinning-Reel-W0QQAdIdZ292841505
595826,mercman,2011-06-23 19:33:00,7054,Dang !!! I through my old one in the garbage last year  
595827,tb4me,2011-06-23 19:34:00,3295,What makes them so special? Just wondering why they are worth $85
595830,Harrison,2011-06-23 19:37:00,2202,$85 is fair if in the condition stated.  They are getting harder to find in good working condition.
595832,irishfield,2011-06-23 19:48:00,26272,Was always my favourite.... it's hanging up around here somewhere and Spiel told me parts were cheap...think I'll find it while Leah gets our clothes washed for the trip North.
595834,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-23 19:55:00,10439," They were worth a whole lot more in the 90's as they were a coveted steelhead fishing reel. They were selling for $200-$250 back then. I have one just like that and don't think I'll part with it, too much history. The drags were very good and they were very solidly built reels that rarely broke down even under the hard use of steelheading."
595836,misfish,2011-06-23 19:55:00,29133,I had a 3 green/white one about 10 years ago.Sold it for 225 bucks.It was mint and in the box.
595840,mercman,2011-06-23 19:59:00,7054,
595841,crappieperchhunter,2011-06-23 19:59:00,2582,I gave mine to a fellow carper a few years ago. It was in mint shape. Now he has a proper baitrunner reel for carping and I don't think he uses it anymore.  If he ends up selling it I hope he splits the $$$ with me
595850,craigdritchie,2011-06-23 20:36:00,1586,Cardinals were awesome reels .... for the 1970s.  I'm still amazed at the insane amounts of money some people paid for them in the 90s. I sold one of mine for around $250 .... not bad for a reel that's realistically worth $50 at best.
595857,Fang,2011-06-23 20:49:00,1330,"The 4's have been dropping $ on ebay and usually go around $50-60 but that's without shipping. 3's still will cost you close to $100 in good shape. With a box you can get to that $200 mark pretty quick. It's a collector reel for those who saw/had them through the 70's and early 80's. Light years ahead of it's time and a drag system that still rivals todays top end reels for way more money.  The weight and constant clicker makes this a display case reel for me, but I know of a couple guys who still use them all the time.  Been actually thinking of picking up a 7 for carp just for a laugh."
595864,irishfield,2011-06-23 21:02:00,26272,"I was thinking 4... it's a 3 I have, now where did I put that green gem..."
595882,Ziki,2011-06-23 21:55:00,128,  Never throw a reel away! even if its not worth much you can annually trade it into BPS for a discount on a new one!
595899,misfish,2011-06-23 22:33:00,29133,"  Heres the kicker Craig.  Bought it at a garage sale,found it in the bottom of a bin of stuff. Asked how much,,,,,,,,,,,2 bucks. Thats was gold."
595922,Harrison,2011-06-23 23:34:00,2202,I just really enjoy using them off the piers.  They take a serious pounding and keep going.  Then again I hunt down vintage clothing....anyone here have any 70's or 80's t shirts?
595957,irishfield,2011-06-24 00:11:00,26272,I think I still have my flanel lined jeans... ala Bay City Rollers... Phil! You want'm....
595985,esoxansteel,2011-06-24 00:39:00,1307,"The early cardinals were the reel for steelheading as the pin is today, before the cardinal it was the mitchell 410 which was a blueish color with high speed retrieve, FYI the clicker pin on the cardinals is well known for breaking, some used a pin to replace it but a number 12 guitar string works best and will never break again as its made for strumming, also bail springs were the other part that occasionally broke,  3 cardinal 4s recently sold on Ebay for 65.00 2 were complete reels and the other was a parts reel,   The shakespear 1810s and 1800 wonderreels were also frequently found on many of the tribs as well, still use my old wonder reels for old time time trips down memory lane,"

596270,Beans,2011-06-24 15:15:00,3339, Hey CPH...I would never think of selling it....would return it to you before that...  I keep it handy in case I have trouble with my other carp outfit...  It is a Zebco 6
