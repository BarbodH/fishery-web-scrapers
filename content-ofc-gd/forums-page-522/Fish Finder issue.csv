When i'm trolling  it jumps around in the depth it will go from 28 fow  to .8 and stay there sometimes if i reach down and put my hand under the traducer and it comes back. Other times it wont and it stays at .8 fow even if i'm in deep water.  I followed the instructions  on were to place the transducer  Any help on this or if someone else had this problem or still does.  "

596037,irishfield,2011-06-24 01:55:00,26272,Generally an air bubble under the transducer does that G. Try lowering it a tad... or clicking it down a notch on the angle adjust.

596484,adempsey,2011-06-25 03:06:00,1498,Does it happen all the time or only when you are going a decent speed??
596501,NANUK,2011-06-25 05:00:00,797,"Sounds like a faulty transducer, can you check your head unit on a buddy's boat with the same setup?"
596502,Raf,2011-06-25 05:53:00,3495," there's your problem  if it has a setting for reducing surface clutter, try that."
596524,Whitespinnerbait,2011-06-25 11:23:00,2038,Minor adjustment is all thats needed...                  The result..
