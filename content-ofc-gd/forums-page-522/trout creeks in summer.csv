596992,danbouck,2011-06-27 00:47:00,4380,I know a couple
596993,ehg,2011-06-27 00:50:00,2666, Was about to say the same thing. The season for headwater residents is practically closed due to high temperatures leading to mortality of said fish. As if anyone would post location of an obviously small delicate fishing spot on the web anyways.
