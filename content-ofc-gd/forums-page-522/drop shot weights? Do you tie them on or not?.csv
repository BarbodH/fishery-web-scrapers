596354,sconceptor,2011-06-24 19:52:00,146,"Hey,  I always tie my drop shot weights on even though the diagrams I see for using them, it just looks as though they just slide the line in and pull it tight.  I don't want to go through a bunch of them on the water, and have them fly off fighting fish or slide off on snags, therefore I just give a simple knot or two on them....I can't ajust without cutting, but at least I'm not loosing them.  Wondering what others do?"
596355,Mike the Pike,2011-06-24 20:06:00,3421,No they squeeze your line they are made so they will come off instead of getting snagged at the bottom.
596359,CanadianShark,2011-06-24 20:09:00,13,"Hey there  I have  never lost a drop shot weight  I slide the line through eye of the swivel and pull it up so it gets pinched in the narrow part  It holds the line pretty good , you have to really pull the line to loosen it out.  If you are concerned it wont hold you can always use pliers to squeeze the eye  over the line"
596361,Joeytier,2011-06-24 20:11:00,3990,"I squeeze the eyelet of the drop shot weight tight with pliers, so it holds good, but if I do get snagged, it will still pull out and not break up higher."
596366,rufus,2011-06-24 20:18:00,267,I use 6 lb test when drop shotting and do not tie the line. I sometimes have to adjust the opening as it it is often squeezed too tight (depending on the brand of weights) so that it will actually cut the line if the weights are used as-is right out of the package.
596367,Lunker777,2011-06-24 20:18:00,866,"Never tied a knot on a drop shot weight ! Like others have said... if ya get snagged, I wuld rather lose the weight"
596452,Garry2Rs,2011-06-25 01:27:00,1425,When no one is watching me I use barrel sinkers and jamb the line with a round toothpick... With light line I tie an overhand knot in the end of the line to make sliding the sinker off a little harder.
596467,Alumacraft,2011-06-25 02:19:00,139,After I slide my dropshot weight on I tie a small clear bead on the tag end my line to prevent the weight from slipping off. I started doing this last year and have found that it works well for me.  Rob
596473,PikeMolester,2011-06-25 02:42:00,428,never tie. I rather lose a weight than trokar hooks and plastics
596478,bigreddog,2011-06-25 02:49:00,84,"I tie an overhand knot on the tag end and then pull the clip down to the knot.  The weight is secure, but if it snags, it will pull off and I'll only lose the weight."
596483,spinnerbaitking,2011-06-25 03:03:00,1622,"Never tied one on yet, loose the odd one on a big smallie but it's worth it SBK"
596492,OhioFisherman,2011-06-25 03:45:00,6623," A worm weight and rubber peg works also, never lost a regular dropshot weight by it accidentally sliding off, but I used them on 8# test line.  Flea market around the corner from me sold worm weights at times for 25 cents a package, way cheaper than you see drop shot weights for."
596530,hirk,2011-06-25 11:37:00,571,"Soft/clean bottom I tie them,rocks no just pinch the line."
596753,misfish,2011-06-26 01:56:00,29133, Ok
596830,Dave Bailey,2011-06-26 12:55:00,1641,"Just got back into semi-serious fishing recently, and never heard of drop-shotting until last year, on this board I believe. I use a 'quick and dirty' set-up. Palomar a hook about a foot and a half to two feet up the line and pinch some tin or bismuth split shot on the bottom. Worked well on smallmouth last year up at Killarney P.P."
596840,Fish Farmer,2011-06-26 13:47:00,2234,"Somebody just made that name up  . That style of fishing has been around for centuries. I think it started back home, down east, they call it set-lines, but only 1 or 2 hooks. , any style of bell sinker will work just as good. To get less snags, use a piece of lead wire on the end. Make a small hole in the end of the wire with a awl, and bend the wire like a banana"
