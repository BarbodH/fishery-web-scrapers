Took it down so deep I had to cut the line and remove the lure backward through the gill. Just a quick pic while the hook was slowly working its way into my finger, fortunately didn't get too far. Fish was released and swam away immediately, no doubt with an unbelievable story to tell his buddies.  "

That is what I do.  I point my finger at them and say ""You don't tell a bloody soul about this"".  To my knowledge, no fish I released have ever broken their silence."
