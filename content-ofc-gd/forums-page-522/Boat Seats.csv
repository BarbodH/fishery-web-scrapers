596327,jimmer,2011-06-24 18:04:00,2730,I bought my system at Robinson Marine just north of Lindsay. They are on Hwy #35. I'm sure most marinas or boat supply companies can order this for you.
596076,supernaut,2011-06-24 02:47:00,46,Has anyone had success doing this? The bench is full of floatation material so there is no way to put nuts on the bottom. If I use sheet metal screws as we all know they are going to eventually wallow out and become loose. Any suggestions?  Thanks
596087,Jds63,2011-06-24 02:56:00,1365,"good question .... I would also like to know what are some options as well,  I currently use the bracket that sits on top of the bench, it works but I feel that it puts the seat up higher than it should be"
596090,Mike the Pike,2011-06-24 03:00:00,3421,Do you have regular bench seats that go accross from one side of the boat to the other and do you have a split bench at the stern.
596102,supernaut,2011-06-24 03:12:00,46,"I have the regular bench that goes across, I've mounted the store bought bracket with the clamps but they always come loose and it doesn't matter how much I torque it down."
596104,Mike the Pike,2011-06-24 03:13:00,3421,This is a bracket  mount that wrap around the bench you can get them at CTC and Wallmart.     
596107,Mike the Pike,2011-06-24 03:15:00,3421, Use pliers and tighten always worked for me.but you have to tighten almost every outing if you encounter heavy chop.
596108,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-24 03:16:00,10439,"There is a very simple and good method for bolting them in. I used 1/4"" plus nuts to bolt my seats in (they were originally just screwed in from the factory). They are much stronger now and with lock washers will never come loose unless I want them to.  Plus Nuts  "
596109,irishfield,2011-06-24 03:18:00,26272,"""Well"" nuts or toggle bolts."
596110,supernaut,2011-06-24 03:19:00,46,Mike the Pike !  That is what I have now. Just wondering if there's a better way?
596123,Mike the Pike,2011-06-24 03:43:00,3421, looks like drifter has a good idea.Wayne has a good idea too.These mounts worked very well for me.Have you tried tightening the wing nuts with vice grips
596126,NAW,2011-06-24 03:48:00,4022,"How thick is the wood you are mounting you seat too?  The way I mounted mine works great, but the ply I mounted mine to was about 5/8 thick.."
596137,supernaut,2011-06-24 04:23:00,46,"I have the bracket clamps mounted directly to the seat no wood, the bench is metal on top of floatation material."
596144,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-24 04:49:00,10439,"  The Plus Nuts I posted about will do the trick for you. I have some 5/16"" ones and an installation tool I can send you when the mail strike is over if you like. Unfortunately I don't have any 1/4"" ones so you will need to open up the holes on your seat mount."
596170,supernaut,2011-06-24 11:14:00,46,Drifter! Where did you purchase those Plus Nuts ?
596181,SylvanOwner,2011-06-24 12:13:00,266,"I like the solutions that Drifter and Irish have proposed.  I went one step further and cut out an access hatch on the side of my bench then removed enough flotation to allow installation of a backing plate/strip of aluminum, used a seat base as a guide for drilling holes in said backing plate and bolted in seat base with nylock nuts.  Fill in the space with expandable foam and rivet a cover plate over the access hole.  Comes out pretty tidy, not a great deal of work and solid!!  This allows me to use a pedestal seat with a removable post.  Post in for fishing, post out for traveling.  Had this setup for 6 or 7 years now, used it in rough water many times with post in and adult casting from seat with no troubles.  Last year I even bought a ""bicycle"" seat style seat on an extendable post and have no trouble leaning against the seat with my feat on the gunwales and casting."
596182,scugpg,2011-06-24 12:17:00,1373,You could get a piece of wood to go across the entire bench and use stainless fasteners to screw it down. Then use the Plus or Well nuts under the wood to fasten the seat. Carpet or vinyl the wood afterwards.
596194,Jds63,2011-06-24 12:44:00,1365,"Supernaut, thanks for starting this thread , I had been wondering what i could do as well. My seats also become loose after a while. Most of the people I know have much nicer boats tha mine and don't have this hassle with brackets.  LOL  Thanks guys for the ideas, I'll investigate the Plus or Well nuts as an option."
596219,supernaut,2011-06-24 13:28:00,46,Your welcome jds63! thank you guys for your input!
596252,blue pickeral,2011-06-24 14:35:00,267,"Here's another product you might consider:   If you look just above / right to the gas can in the bow, you will see an aluminum piece fastened with SS screws to front of seat bulkhead. Check the seat immediately behind and you will see how the seat attachment fits into this piece-kind of a tilt and drop in. The seat bolts down onto an aluminum plate that fits onto the length of aluminum.  It is stable, and you can create several positions in the boat for the same seat.  I got this material several years ago and can't remember the name of it, but maybe someone else does and can help source if you're interested."
596255,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-24 14:39:00,10439,  I got mine at the business I was working at in the 90's down in Mississauga. They don't sell to the public though as they are a manufacturing plant that deals with truck up-fitting. You could order them online though.
596262,jimmer,2011-06-24 14:57:00,2730,This is the same system I used and is by far the best for smaller boats.
596264,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-24 15:02:00,2690," Not sure where Supernaut is located, but, Massels Marine in New Hamburg has the system that Jimmer shows here."
596265,SylvanOwner,2011-06-24 15:04:00,266,"  I like this method as well, allows the seat to slide which you can use to adjust balance or find that perfect driving position and easy removal for theft proofing.  Just don't leave the seats in while traveling because they will slide out when driving and may even roll out of the boat, say while on the highway or something"
596309,blue pickeral,2011-06-24 17:05:00,267," Yes, as you or your spouse gains weight over the years....   Never had a problem with this...backs fold down and rubber bumpers provide some friction...you had some bad luck?"
596316,supernaut,2011-06-24 17:33:00,46,I'm in Mississauga! This seems like it might work. I'm definitely going to seek this out...thanks
