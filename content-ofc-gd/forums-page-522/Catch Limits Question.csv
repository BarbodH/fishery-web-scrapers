596485,skeeter,2011-06-25 03:26:00,1907,"Question:  In all the zones there are 2 limits to how many fish you can keep. Sport and Conservation. Example> Walleye & Sauger or any combination Jan. 1 to Mar. 15 & 3rd Sat. in May to Dec. 31 S - 4; not more than 1 greater than 46 cm (18.1 in.) C - 2; not more than 1 greater than 46 cm (18.1 in.) Largemouth & Smallmouth Bass or any combination 4th Sat. in June to Nov. 30 S - 6 C - 2 Northern Pike Jan. 1 to Mar. 31 & 3rd Sat. in May to Dec. 31 S - 6 C - 2 Muskellunge 1st Sat. in June to Dec. 15 S - 1; must be greater than 91 cm (36 in.) C - 0 Yellow Perch Open all year S - 50 C - 25 Crappie Open all year S - 30 C - 10 Sunfish Open all year S - 50 C - 25   Now I understand all of this but what i don't get is why in zone 17 & 18 the sunfish limit is, S-300 C-15  That is a really big difference between 300 and 15?"
596487,Roy,2011-06-25 03:32:00,13728,It's new for Zone 17. Do a search on it in here....there was a lot of talk about it.  It was supposed to be 500 but they were bargained all the way down to 300.
596489,BillM,2011-06-25 03:34:00,17367,"Roy, can you imagine cleaning 300 panfish?  LOL!!!!!"
596491,Sinker,2011-06-25 03:43:00,8692,Ask the rice lake tourist association  S.
596496,John Bacon,2011-06-25 04:20:00,3277, Typo?  Conservation limits are usually half of the sport limits.  Perhaps they dropped the zero.
596663,bucktail,2011-06-25 22:45:00,1857,300 panfish to clean ....   kill me now!!!!
596689,wallyboss,2011-06-26 00:29:00,1095,Or get an electric knife
596999,ehg,2011-06-27 01:09:00,2666,"Goes to show that lobbying or making enough noise does work.  Thirty years ago American tourists would rent cottages and take home their limit of walleyes. Was good for the tourism industry in Kawarthas. With the walleye being more restricted and zebra mussels clearing the water and sending walleyes off rock shoals into weeds, they want to encourage Americans to still collect fillets, but of bluegills instead. Thus the 300 limit on sunfish for Kawarthas. Even with electric knife it would be a pain but 300 sunfish could be 50lbs or more of fillets."
