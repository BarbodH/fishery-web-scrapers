Been fishing since a kid, well as much as a city kid can do with two parents who worked long days and whose vocabulary didn't include the word 'vacation'. Fished ultralight or fly if tripping in Algonquin but kinda drifted away for a bunch of years but getting back into it last few years. Been hitting the French lately but the fish stock is safe for now lol. Also appeased the prop gods of the French R with two offerings last year   Spend pre fishing season in a drysuit paddling whitewater canoe as soon as ice is out.  Still love ultralight and regular spinning but plan to concentrate on fishing for pike with fly gear and trying to convince SWMBO that I need a full console 16' boat.  Hope to be able offer what I can to the boards if only for entertainment value   woddenboater"

607491,woodenboater,2011-07-29 03:25:00,2277," thanks everyone and mercman, wooden boats are great until it's time to quickly throw the mooring cover on when rain comes quick and hard  the feel and sound of wooden boats/canoes definitely can't be matched however."
