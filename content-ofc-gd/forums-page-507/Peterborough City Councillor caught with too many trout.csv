604854,jimmer,2011-07-20 20:08:00,2730,I don't think they care. The lack of respect regarding certain things in our society has gone down the tubes lately.
604883,Billy Bob,2011-07-20 21:43:00,5865,"Tell me, why wasn't all his gear forfeited including boat, motor, trailer and truck....."
604886,BillM,2011-07-20 21:48:00,17367, Officers discretion.
604994,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-21 03:30:00,0," I might be mistaken but i think the wording is that you can only keep one greater than 16 inches, so in actuality you can also keep 2 small fish.  It's definitely tough and I think the last 2 winters it has just increased pressure on the brook trout lakes."
605228,spincast,2011-07-21 22:20:00,3279,  or money and political connections......
605330,Jer,2011-07-22 10:44:00,1426,"   I think you're over-estimating the power of a lowly city councillor, it's not even a full-time job."
605359,Bassive,2011-07-22 13:10:00,58,Catch and release keeps you in the clear. Metro has fish for sale.
605373,Grimace,2011-07-22 13:46:00,2020, As does catching and keeping a legal limit.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping a legal limit.  Edit: IPhone induced typo.
605385,troutologist,2011-07-22 14:24:00,951,"  I understand keeping fish, and often do just that; but don't get the fact that people are changing how/where they fish just to accomodate harvesting more. I don't think that winter fishing for lake trout would be ruined for me since I can (in practice) keep just 1 fish...."
605386,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-22 14:33:00,0," It has possibly IMPROVED lake trout fishing for folks like us because many aren't willing to go to remote areas for only 2 fish.  I noticed a lot more traffic into brook trout lakes this winter, both natural and stocked."
605390,troutologist,2011-07-22 14:41:00,951,Thats both good and bad...hopefully the talks about a FMZ 10 review of brook trout regs will bring a reduced limit into fruition...
605516,spincast,2011-07-23 00:18:00,3279,  notice I had two elements. And I'm not.
605971,fishinguypat,2011-07-25 04:39:00,547,"Pardon my french but... they were just a couple fish and they paid the fines and everything so, give the poor man a break"
605972,spinnerdoc,2011-07-25 05:03:00,556,maybe all that work is just for show....politicians tend to do that
606119,Toronto_Angler,2011-07-25 18:33:00,698,Wow looks like the hall-monitors are at it again. Give the guy a break geez
606120,Spiel,2011-07-25 18:41:00,9065, Do you honestly believe that this is his first infraction against the fishing regs? I wonder what the odds are for being nailed on your first ever infraction given the limited number of CO's versus the number of water bodies in the province.....
606147,torco,2011-07-25 20:24:00,656,  Very good point. I hate to pass judgment but he was likely no following the regs for some time. Why who knows but he was caught and hopefully he has been served notice.
606216,Roy,2011-07-25 22:56:00,13728,He probably doesn't even come to a complete stop at stop signs!  Just sayin'...
607946,Guest BigBeliever,2011-07-30 22:51:00,0,I have met this guy and fished with him.  Rules are not for him. He does what ever he wants. And I won't fish or drive with him again. And that Rob Thompson character isn't much better.  Just not as smart.
603012,Grimace,2011-07-15 13:23:00,2020,Jerk.  http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3214171
603014,HTHM,2011-07-15 13:29:00,4082,He may have trouble getting re-elected.
603017,SmokestackLightnin,2011-07-15 13:46:00,390," Dan McWilliams is not a jerk. Dan is a standup guy who has done a ton for the outdoors and a lot of work getting kids involved in fishing. I knew Dan years ago when my parents owned a cottage on the Kawarthas and I hung around with his brother-in-laws. He has done extensive work with DU Peterborough. As well, the Greenwing kids derby which he runs has been going on for 24 years and is the largest one of its kind. His company, McWilliams Moving and Storage supports numerous local charities.  I have not seen Dan in 20 years so it's not like I am a close personal friend. I do however see the work that he has done over the years as well as the good work he is doing for the City of Peterborough.  From what I have read in the paper, Dan made a mistake interpretting the Ontario Fishing Regulations and kept 1 fish more than his daily limit. I am pretty sure there are others who are reading that have mistaken what is read in the regs. He accepted his mistake, plead guilty as he knew he was and paid his fine. Let's move on. All I ask is that before anyone condemns him as a threat to society, please Google his name and see what else this man has done."
603026,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-15 14:01:00,4399,"Seems he really messed up forgot his license,too many fish,and keeping fish in the restricted slot! And he is a conservationist!!!"
603031,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-15 14:10:00,0,"Oof...  They kept too many fish AND kept fish within the slot.  4 guys, 9 fish + 6 carcasses.  So he thought they were allowed to keep three, but they kept 15?  That's still 3 over the limit they thought they were allowed to keep?!?!?!?!  Typically REAL conservationists know the regs of where they are fishing, especially on natural trout lakes..  I don't see why excuses are being made for him.  I think ""jerk"" was a fair assessment."
603066,Joey,2011-07-15 16:05:00,9122,"Yup, feigning ignorance just doesn't seem to cut it for this one"
603273,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-16 02:21:00,2585,"  Hes not a threat to society, just the trout population in the kawarthas.  Just saying"
603900,johnnyb,2011-07-18 13:38:00,3413,"In the information the MNR released to the newspaper, they included the fact that there was a copy of the regs on the dash of the truck, and Mr. McWilliams opened it right up to the page where Havelock Lake is listed as having the slot size. So he ""forgot"" his license...honest mistake.  But ""forgetting"" what the regs say....when there's a copy of them in the truck?  Sorry...he was either too lazy to check the regs, and deserves the fine, or he is an outright liar, and deserves a bigger fine.   "
603913,beginner,2011-07-18 14:10:00,542,"In my opinion I think he probably think nobody would check them, after all his a councilor and they wouldnt be bother by some MNR.. I say good job to the CO for checking them, meaning no bias.. who ever you are, big or small... political or not.."
604264,chris.brock,2011-07-19 06:38:00,4053,"I would like to see him step down and get a real job, he broke the law claiming ignorance while if anyone, he should know the regs  I think the ""jerk"" comment is justified, he deserves it, and probably worse"
604272,singingdog,2011-07-19 09:49:00,1047,"Part of being a ""conservationist"" is knowing the regs.....especially limits and slot limits. I personally don't buy his story."
604607,GreenCanada,2011-07-20 02:44:00,375," From what I read the fish that could be measured five of the six were in the restricted size class. So not only did they take more fish than legally allowed, over 80% of the ones that could be measured were an illegal size.  Is Dan a jerk? Maybe, maybe not. But he was a jerk for taking more than allowed and keeping ones of an illegal size."
604635,Whitespinnerbait,2011-07-20 09:07:00,2038,He's not a jerk............He's a Poacher !!
604689,jimmer,2011-07-20 13:07:00,2730,"Is there anywhere in Ontario that allows 3 lakers? I don't know of anywhere around the kawarthas that allows more than two. Not only was he caught, he is lying by saying it was a mistake. I'm pretty sure he knew what he was doing. This should be a lesson to all poachers that you will eventually be caught if you're breaking the fishing regs! Well, I guess I'm off to catch my daily limit of 8 bass. LOL"
604690,Dara,2011-07-20 13:08:00,3052,The government needs to put more into fishing so we don't have to deal with such crappy regs and limits.  This lake trout limit of one under and one over is insane.  I fish a lot of lakes where you will never get an over and an under...so you sit all day fishing for an under and releasing fish that will just die...makes more sense to just take 2 and be done
604724,anders,2011-07-20 14:34:00,1168," Lake Superior, Zone 9, 3 lakers any size...and tasty too"
604760,Sinker,2011-07-20 16:09:00,8692,"IMO, they knew the regs, and still kept what they did. They probably do this all the time, just got caught this time. Guys do this all the time, I've seenn it over and over.  3 fish limit on lakers?? Never even heard of it around here. I consider all laker lakes to be a 2 fish limit with a slot on every lake, until I have read otherwise in the regs.  I would be pretty embarrassed if I was him.  S."
604776,Billy Bob,2011-07-20 16:35:00,5865,Many politicians think they are above the law and when caught it's always a mistake.....
604779,Dara,2011-07-20 16:41:00,3052,"  No slot here. 1 over and 1 under 16"" or some silly thing like that. Just what is the mortality for a laker released after being ripped out of 100' of water and dumped back in because its the wrong length."
604782,chris.brock,2011-07-20 16:50:00,4053,"I'm guessing the survival rate is pretty good for released lake trout even from 80+ feet down, most of them ""burp"" air bubbles and swim straight back down"
604785,johnnyb,2011-07-20 16:58:00,3413,Good point on the burping....lakers seem to handle the depth change quite well....I've noticed they are no fan of warm water....had a good sized one years back in the canoe and we drifted into shore by the time it got landed.  Had to paddle out to the deeper water and he perked right up and kicked away strong. The slot limit in Minden has me releasing lots of lakers and they all swim straight down with no issues
604789,chris.brock,2011-07-20 17:08:00,4053,this is from the Yukon Fishing Regs-    Survival rates are high Studies reviewed by the Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board show that survival rates for released fish can be very high. These studies suggest that about 94% of released pike survive along with about 90% of grayling. Survival rates for released lake trout range from 93% for lightly handled fish to 76% for deep-hooked fish. Hook placement is a significant factor affecting the survival of all species
604837,monsterfish,2011-07-20 19:26:00,48,"Trust me, this was no mistake!"
604841,adolson,2011-07-20 19:37:00,783," Not in this guy's case, for sure. But I'm surprised at a few people I know who think the limit on walleye is five in our zone, when it's actually 4, with size restrictions. I guess there was a change at some point and they don't bother keeping on top of it."
604850,Jer,2011-07-20 20:03:00,1426,"We've had many changes here in Zone 17 to our pickerel regs the last couple years, yet I'm still astounded by the number of people I talk to, many who fish regularly, who don't have a clue (or couldn't care less)."
