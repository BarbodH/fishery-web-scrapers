607509,radar,2011-07-29 03:58:00,138,I'm at Bark Lake by Barry's Bay right now. My buddy installed a new Hummingbird depth finder. Lower end. Periodically it just switches to 0.6 ft. Always 0.6 And the screen is garbled. Any ideas? We've  adjusted the angle but will take it apart tomorrow to try and figure it out.
607512,irishfield,2011-07-29 04:07:00,26272,Usually an air bubble under the transducer that does that. Take a scrub pad or something and lightly take the shine off the bottom of the transducer so the air bubble can't stick.
