Crystal Beach or Abino) Any advice would be much appreciated!!! We were planning on using tubes and crankbaits. Tight Lines!! SeaBear"

607995,Live2fish85,2011-07-31 02:41:00,1633,Well it is Lake Erie they are all over just do what is usual and you should get them.
607996,Bondar,2011-07-31 02:50:00,817,Theres Bass in Lake Erie ?? hmm
608003,SeaBear,2011-07-31 03:40:00,5,"Hey Dan, aren't those HandleBarz meant for Muskies? Thanks for the info!!!"
608004,spinnerbaitking,2011-07-31 03:44:00,1622,  & BIG SMALLIES or are you after the little ones lol SBK
608006,SeaBear,2011-07-31 03:48:00,5,"Yes, we are looking for the Bigguns. Are you simply dropping the spinners down and jigging or slow retrieve? Sorry for acting like such a rook, it's been a while.  PS... Are the coordinates for Cedar Point in Sandusky?"
608007,Live2fish85,2011-07-31 03:54:00,1633,His answer was sacastic I assume the same as the rest.
608011,SeaBear,2011-07-31 04:00:00,5,"You know, I remembered that this site had alot of good info and very helpful members. Just looking to make tomorrow a good day for me and my kid. Look forward to riding roller coasters in Sandusky tomorrow"
608013,Live2fish85,2011-07-31 04:13:00,1633,"Most people just give a bit about them. I doubt anyone will give up hot spots, specailly on a public forum. But as I said before it's Lake Erie you can find bass pretty well any where that bass would be stay some what shallow and do what you where saying I am sure you and you kid will get some."

608148,dave524,2011-07-31 22:14:00,4508," Same deal with my dad 50 years ago out of Port Colborne, only he had a fine mesh net with a triangular hoop, we go the night before to a few clay bottom farm ponds,locally, and get a mess of crayfish, he was very particular on size. They'd outfish minnows by a long shot, guess that is against the law now  He had an old green Johnson 5 1/2 and he'd rent a 16 foot cedar strip for 50 cents a hour or $3 for the day"
