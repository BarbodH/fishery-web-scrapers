606387,Ron,2011-07-26 15:58:00,1683,"Just an update for everyone. I received my court date for fishing in the Cobourg Harbour. It is set for Monday August 22nd, 2011. For those of you who fish the tribs in the Town of Cobourg, wish me luck! The bylaw they charged me under, they could essentially fine everyone who fishes on Public property owned by the Town of Cobourg.  I will post the outcome once all this hoopla is over.  Cheers, Ron..."
606391,beginner,2011-07-26 16:10:00,542,"I remember you post that couple a months ago, what grounds did they convict you with?? because the last time the cop could not figured to give you ticket for ur offence... I wish gudluck Ron..."
606398,lew,2011-07-26 16:47:00,12766,Go gettem Ron !!  I'm assuming the court will be in Coburg ??
606402,Joey,2011-07-26 17:05:00,9122,Good Luck Ron!  Do you need moral support
606408,Spiel,2011-07-26 17:23:00,9065, ....Or financial support?  Let me know!
606409,Whopper,2011-07-26 17:28:00,2174,Good Luck Ron
606418,mercman,2011-07-26 18:34:00,7054,  X2 Ron !!!! Knock thier sox off Buddy !!!   Paul
606452,Big Cliff,2011-07-26 20:28:00,6899," Give me the time and place if you would like some moral support, I'd be happy to take time off work to come down and support you if it will help in anyway!"
606453,irishfield,2011-07-26 20:30:00,26272,  Yep what Spiel said..... I threw a $100 up in the original post and many others followed suit. Ron... take us up on it and get a good lawyer for YOUR fight for OUR rights!
606492,Handlebarz,2011-07-26 22:02:00,3790,Go get them Ronnie BTW are there any places that have wing night on Mondays in Cobourg? and i am in to help the fine
606497,Ron,2011-07-26 22:28:00,1683,"Thanks for the offers everyone.  At this point in time, I won't need any financial assistance. However, if this motion gets carried to the next level it may end up being a little on costly side. I can't say any more for the time being but the Town of Cobourg lawyers will have some work on their hands. The most important part for the time being, is getting the reversal on the right to fish in Provincially legislated waters.  As for moral support, lets hold off on that as well until the next court date as I am certain there will be additional court dates. This will be a preliminary I assume.  Cheers, Ron..."
606512,Garnet,2011-07-26 23:09:00,2056,I'm in for a donation. Let us know.
606531,danc,2011-07-27 00:14:00,4677,"Sounds like a no brainer to me Ron, but like the others, I'll pitch in if it gets down and dirty.  Cheers Bud.."
606679,fishermccann,2011-07-27 14:07:00,655,"You just have to let us know when, and where, to show up, GOOD-LUCK.."
606695,fishnsled,2011-07-27 14:32:00,3520,"Go get them Ron! Just let us know when and how we can help. We have 7,438 members here and if everyone pitched in $10 or $20 dollars we could put a dent in your costs. It is your future of fishing everyone!"
606809,Ron,2011-07-27 18:34:00,1683,"Thanks again everyone for you support.  There is definitely one outcome out all of this....  I will be fishing at the Cobourg Harbour immediately after the trial. I am by all means not organizing an event on August 22nd, but I can't stop you from fishing yourselves. Be forwarned though, you are on your own responsibility for a good chance of receiving a warning or a ticket.  Myself, I will be on the East Pier at 1:00pm provided I am out of court at that time.  Cheers, Ron..."
606826,cuzza,2011-07-27 19:13:00,467," I would think they'll try and deal with it all in one session, no preliminaries. Assuming they've given you a ticket and you're contesting it rather than paying the fine - you've effectively pleaded not guilty.  Make sure all you have all the facts on you - I doubt the town are doing too much work on it, so if you can catch them with their pants down, it'll get thrown out - they'll state the bylaw you've broken with evidence to that effect and then it's up to you to argue you didn't.  Good luck!"
607044,Uncle Buck,2011-07-28 01:39:00,1000,"Don't drop the soap Ron!!  sorry, couldn't resist  Good on you for fighting for our rights!!"
607047,BillM,2011-07-28 02:00:00,17367," He hasn't pleaded not guilty to anything yet.  When he goes to court, then he'll plead not guilty and receive a trial date.  They won't be doing the trial on the same day,  it will be a few months from now."
607064,Moosebunk,2011-07-28 02:27:00,3970,Give'mHell Ron!
607132,cuzza,2011-07-28 12:27:00,467," It's a bylaw violation, not a murder trial - he got a ticket, like speeding, if you pay, you're pleading guilty, you challenge it and you're pleading not guilty."
607196,TJQ,2011-07-28 15:00:00,7806,Its the TRIAL OF THE CENTURY!! God luck Ron. Your obviously as guilty as this guy!!!  
607418,BillM,2011-07-29 00:42:00,17367," What exactly don't you understand?  He goes in, pleads not guilty, they set a court date sometime down the road, he goes back in and pleads his case.  It's not rocket science."
607539,MJL,2011-07-29 11:12:00,2427," If the fish didn't hit, you must acquit"
