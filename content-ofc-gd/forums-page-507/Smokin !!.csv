608135,tb4me,2011-07-31 21:08:00,3295,id skip the smoker...But thats me..My fav way is dry rub then the indirect method..Heat on one side meat on the other..2 or 3 hrs later oh baby!!! you can even get creative and make your own mop sauce..

608142,woodenboater,2011-07-31 21:43:00,2277,got dry rub ribs on the Weber right now and probably gonna give it about 3 hours or so. Indirect with chunks of hickory for smokey goodness.
