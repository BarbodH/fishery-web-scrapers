607462,JCRG,2011-07-29 02:24:00,57,"I caught this smallie last year but i didn't have my scale, how much do you all think it weights? It put up a tremendous fight! thanks  "
607473,ChrisK,2011-07-29 02:42:00,2772,It looks like a 20 incher..I say 3.5 pounds
607531,singingdog,2011-07-29 09:45:00,1047,You need some kind of measurement to estimate weight....at least length.
607532,workwear,2011-07-29 10:08:00,592,i would say a little over 3....always a nice fight from these guys....
607537,Harrison,2011-07-29 10:48:00,2202,"Between knuckles on the pinky is about an inch, so I'd say 3.1 lbs"
607538,Roy,2011-07-29 11:02:00,13728,"This might help you. For comparisons sake, I got this pb LM on Wednesday. It's a 5.2 (oz) beauty. It just annihilated my buzzbait. "
607542,grimsbylander,2011-07-29 11:40:00,3016,"  I'm assuming the ""pb"" is short for ""probably bait"" in this case?"
607550,mercman,2011-07-29 11:59:00,7054,   You are such a nut Roy..........
607570,johnnyb,2011-07-29 12:54:00,3413,"Very nice fish....no doubt it would have been an epic battle.  Likely 3-something...but as others have said...SO hard to tell from a pic.  Length is key...in fact, I've stopped weighing my fish, because the length tells me how ""big"" they are.  Back when I did weigh them....a girl I was fishing with pulled in a 21 inch bass that was quite chunky and tipped the scales at 4lbs 13oz.  The very next week...same lake....I pulled in a 20.5 inch bass that barely broke the 2lb mark.   "
607572,craigdritchie,2011-07-29 13:00:00,1586,"Bingo! Best tape measure going. Based on that, your fish is roughly 18 inches long, and probably between 3 and 3.5 pounds. Might be 19 inches, give or take, which would add a little more beef to it and put it squarely in the 3.5 range.    Nice bass! Congrats! It would certainly eat Roy's Personal Bait!  "
607575,spinnerbaitking,2011-07-29 13:02:00,1622,Right now one that size looks good to me lol SBK 
607584,eman,2011-07-29 13:37:00,101,I would agree with 3 to 3.5 lber.  nice measuring trick Craig.
607586,Harrison,2011-07-29 13:43:00,2202," Replace the fish with a severed head and you got a killer ""Spartacus"" going on dude."
607588,kuhaman,2011-07-29 13:50:00,503,Too funny!!! Beauty fish JCRG
607594,grimsbylander,2011-07-29 13:59:00,3016,"  If only we could add sound as well as pictures....""Tonight we dine in hell!!"""
607985,JCRG,2011-07-31 01:57:00,57," Haha...thanks guys, my guess was 4 lb but i'll take the 3 - 3.5 lb Roy, that's a nice fish but i think i have you beat in that category. This guy hit my spinnerbait, and managed to hook himself somehow...  "
