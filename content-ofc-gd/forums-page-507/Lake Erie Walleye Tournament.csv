This year, we will be at a new location, North Erie Marina in Port Bruce. All are welcome to participate and you can find more details here: http://straitlineanglers.com/SLA_LakeErie_Walleye/SLA_LakeErie_Walleye_Tournament.htm  hope to see some OFC'rs there!"
608001,Woodsman,2011-07-31 03:08:00,1286,I checked out the link but the rules tab will not open. Sounds like an interesting time. 2 of us were out of Port Bruce today & managed 6 walleye & although we didn't weigh them the total weight would be close to 30 lbs. Fish are there.    Best Wishes: Rick
