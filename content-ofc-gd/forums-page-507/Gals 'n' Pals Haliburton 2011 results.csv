The weather was great, nobody got injured, Haliburton was left intact, and the usual suspects were making things competitive. There was some discussion over whether the cool spring was going to have any effect on results, but as we tell people every year, it only takes one fish to win a tournament! In all 17 teams took to the waters of Head Lake, and 7 hours later the following results were tallied:  5th place went to Allison and Dan McMullen, with weight of 8.85lbs. 4th was grabbed by Jackie and John Sedgwick, who also had the most colourful boat of the day, with 9.25lbs. 3rd place went to locals Cheryl and Pat Kennedy, who boated 9.75lbs. 2nd was taken by Jenn and Barry McCrackin, who broke into double digits with 11.60lbs.  And once again, the team of Judy and Terry Ruttle showed that they seem to know this lake pretty well, because they managed to take 1st place with 15.80lbs, and had the biggest fish, a smallmouth of 4.25lbs.  Three teams didn’t weigh in, so here are the full results of the fourteen who did.  1 Ruttle, Judy & Terry – 15.80  2 McCrackin, Jenn & Barry – 11.60  3 Kennedy, Cheryl & Pat – 9.75  4 Sedgwick, Jackie & John – 9.25  5 McMullen, Allison & Dan – 8.85  6 Gardiner, Nicole, & Lanegger – 8.60  7 Woodcock, Amber & Ken – 8.60  8 McMaster, Jan & Mark – 7.80  9 Hatton, Linda & Steve – 6.70  10 Wetzel, Kristy & Chris – 6.15  11 Toth, Chantal & Stephen – 5.05  12 Ritza, Tammy & Kevin – 3.30  13 Toth, Serena & Dan – 1.7  14 McLean, Shelley & Todd, 1.35  Next year’s date is probably July 21, presuming that the highland games are being held on July 14, but if they are the week earlier we will take the 14th."
