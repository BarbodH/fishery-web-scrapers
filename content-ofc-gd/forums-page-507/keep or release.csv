607515,Live2fish85,2011-07-29 04:26:00,1633,Looks like it was a tasty meal.
607516,fishing,2011-07-29 04:34:00,167, That's a nice looking dish.
607517,floatingjointed,2011-07-29 04:50:00,5,"irishfield - too bad the head and tail will go into the pot first for the soup, the body is going in soon and the sauce is ready.  fishing - thanks, it took me half and hour to perpare it. (for the picture)  Happy Fishing"
607518,floatingjointed,2011-07-29 04:56:00,5,thanks for the edit live2fish85
607519,Gregoire,2011-07-29 05:02:00,1397, Pregnant..that must be some strong genetic therapy he/she is on...I remember my wife telling me something like that was on Opera once
607523,Live2fish85,2011-07-29 05:37:00,1633, No problem figured I would just leave it be. Keep the fish pics coming though. Always enjoy seeing pics even if it is cooked and makes me hungry.

607528,Carp,2011-07-29 09:28:00,1488,    You didn't do anything wrong. Thanks for the report.  I do agree smaller fish are best for eating and have fewer toxins built up in their bodies.
607557,RyanT,2011-07-29 12:12:00,72,  ABSOLUTELY!!  Should have told nosy to mind his own business.
607566,cjgraham,2011-07-29 12:39:00,104,"Well that guy probably should have minded his own business, but he was correct about keeping the smaller ones. General rule is big fish have a high reproductive success, pass on the best genetics(survival of the fittest) produce more eggs, and as for a bass be able to guard the nest better. And as for toxicology bigger fish generally mean older fish which mean higher concentraions of toxins especially mercury and PCB's. I work for Fisheries and Oceans and see a few toxicology reports here and there. Small fish do mean they are young. Actively feeding healthy fish will grow, and a bass will grow past 1 to 2 lbs pending on the size of its habitat.  "
607585,eman,2011-07-29 13:43:00,101,"Personally, I always throw the big ones back. Take a picture and let her go to produce offspirng and hopefully catch another day. The smaller ones are usually tastier too."
607619,BillM,2011-07-29 14:44:00,17367, Pretty much.  You released 2 fish and kept one..  Don't feel bad about it.
607656,Joeytier,2011-07-29 16:17:00,3990,"Like others have said, I prefer bass in the 1.5 to 2 pound range, but I don't recall ever keeping a bass that large (3+) for the table anyway, so I can't really comment on the taste factor, but the bioaccumulation/age thing is certainly true."
607658,Joeytier,2011-07-29 16:18:00,3990,"Plus, it's only a bass"
607671,crossover,2011-07-29 16:49:00,172,"I kind of prefer the bigger ones since I absolutely hate playing around with the smaller bones when trying to eat it, but the only time I ever eat a fish is when I'm 4 hours up north."
607772,esoxansteel,2011-07-29 22:40:00,1307,"  That was a beauty Lew, FYI Lew stay south of Coe Hill or you might end up like your cousin Leneord"

607774,esoxansteel,2011-07-29 22:50:00,1307,"  The more I divulge in this thread the funnier it gets, the best thread Ive ever seen,"
607907,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-07-30 17:46:00,535,"3 pounds isn't a huge bass, don't feel bad about keeping it at all. I've had a guy say ""What are you doing, cleaning bait?"" when I was cleaning 14-15"" bass in a fish hut. Some people just need to mind their own business. What did make me angry was when I saw a bunch of bass (a couple at least 4lbs) with their heads chopped off laying in a boat launch at Baptiste lake last year. Why the hell would somebody kill bass then just throw the bodies in the water?"
607925,Twocoda,2011-07-30 20:28:00,4130,"you need to fix the ""tune out switch"" when your wife is talking about Oprah to you ..."
607096,floatingjointed,2011-07-28 07:33:00,5,"Hello Everyone  I was fishing in Scugog today, and luckily i got 4 bass, 3 of them about 1-2 lb, and 1 is about 3 lbs, I only keep the 3 lbs one, when i get back to the dock, a guy see me holding the fish, and he told me that I should release the bigger one and not the smallers the reason he said is the 3lb or above is female, should be release and let them lay eggs, so the lake will have more fish... But my theory is if I release the small one(1-2lb), they still have a chance to grow and mate, and the bigger one will just eat more fish for growing bigger.  what do u think? or what should i do , cos i also want to keep the lake healthy (more fish and more balance of the lake)  and what will you keep or release  thanks"
607100,Whitespinnerbait,2011-07-28 09:03:00,2038, Tell the guy to mind his own buisiness
607102,ChrisK,2011-07-28 09:20:00,2772,Welcome to our site.... Everyone is entitled to there opinion when it comes to ethics. Keep what you want as long as its in your possession limit.
607103,Terry,2011-07-28 09:24:00,14456,well the guy is right.. very few smaller fish live to become a 3lber and smaller ones have far less toxins in them  if the guy was casually chatting with you..great info  but if he came up to you and told you...it's no of his business ..you are 100% within your rights to keep the big ones
607104,bowshep,2011-07-28 09:30:00,378,l don't no much about Bass do they really change sex when they get bigger
607112,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-28 11:34:00,2690,  Probably the best answer right there
607115,lew,2011-07-28 11:40:00,12766," Not sure about bass either, but I know my cousin Leonard sure did"
607116,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-28 11:45:00,2690, Almost spewed a bit of coffee on that one
607117,grimsbylander,2011-07-28 11:47:00,3016, Hahahaha  THAT was funny! Poor Leona!
607120,lew,2011-07-28 12:09:00,12766," Actually, it's now Leonora"
607129,Gregoire,2011-07-28 12:21:00,1397,I know a Leonora. Is he/she a bit heavy set?
607131,lew,2011-07-28 12:26:00,12766," Dunno, haven't seen him/her in years but if their heavy set it could be either muscles or pregnant"
607133,Dave Bailey,2011-07-28 12:32:00,1641,"Some species of fish can change sex in response to various types of environmental pressures, but I don't think it happens in largemouth or smallmouth. And like has already been said, tell him to mind his own business."
607136,timmeh,2011-07-28 12:36:00,609,"If you're really interested in helping keep the fishery healthy you should let the big ones go.  Your theory is not correct as most small fish will not grow to be that size. It's just like people, not everyone can grow to be 6 foot 4. Genetics play a key role in determining how large a fish can grow. And it's in the best interest of the fishery to keep those big fish and their genetics in the lake.  Think of it this way; next time you spend your time and money to go fishing do you want to catch 3 lb bass or 1 lb bass.  Also as Terry mentioned larger fish have more toxins built up in their meat, so it's better for your health the eat a smaller fish as well."
607150,Live2fish85,2011-07-28 13:46:00,1633,"As said before the bigger the bass the more likely that there offspring will be of a bigger size, also the 1 to 2 pounders are better to eat for taste and health reason.  But all in all the guy should really mind his own business, you didn't do anything wrong so don't worry.  And welcome to the board."
607158,OutdoorDan,2011-07-28 13:54:00,325,Man people can be nosy.
607163,DanD,2011-07-28 14:04:00,2223," If genetics play the roll as you state (which I do believe); then a fish that is genetically small, does not necessarily mean that it is a young fish or have any less toxins then a larger fish of the same age and species. The percentage of toxins, calculating in their different weights, would likely be the same. Yes if you consume larger fish, you will be eating more toxins; but that’s because there’s more fish to eat.  Dan."
607166,canadadude,2011-07-28 14:07:00,769,"I look at it this way the 1-2 lbers taste great, the 3+lbers not so much, so for me the 1-2 are my eaters if I want a meal.In most populations there are alot of 1-2 lb fish but as you get to the 3+ and into the trophy sizes the numbers reduce drasticly.To each his own , but next time out keep a few 1 lbers for the dinner table and you will soon be letting the bigger ones go."

607193,irishfield,2011-07-28 14:56:00,26272,I love first post like this....
607198,GBW,2011-07-28 15:07:00,8460,I LOL so hard on that Lew I think I may have pee'ed a little...
607207,jedimaster,2011-07-28 15:24:00,3472,"If you want to keep it and its within your limit then keep it. As long as your putting some thought into it and your within your limit go ahead. What is better? keeping 4 small fish or 1 large fish? The genetic makeup of the larger fish has allowed it to reach its size. however at 3 pounds your not exactly taking the cream of the crop. For me personally, I don't keep any bass, musky or pike as they are considered to be catch an release fish by many as they are prized by sport anglers.  Walleye, pan fish, white fish and smaller trout are keepers within the various slot sizes imo."
607343,fishing,2011-07-28 21:16:00,167,Small fish taste better. And big one normally has more toxins in it. Genetics make sense to me also.
607355,mercman,2011-07-28 22:12:00,7054,  My auntie Norman did too Lew. It was very confusing as i grew up. Never knew whether to get Chanel no5 or Old spice.
607489,floatingjointed,2011-07-29 03:24:00,5,"Thanks everyone for the friendly reply.  so I think its better to keep the 1-2 lbers for eating or the lake and maybe this is the last 3 lber that I will take, here is the fish...  one more thing is the guy just casually talking to me, nothing rude. and he is right, she is a female    Thank you"
