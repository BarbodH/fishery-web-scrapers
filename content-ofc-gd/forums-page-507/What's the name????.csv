My dad got me into fishing at a really young age and I was hooked, just can't get enough. So this is my first question for the board. I'm planning on to nanicoke on Monday, I have been there once but can not remember the name of the launch that's right beside the power plant. Any help would be great and if anyone has fished it in the past couple days what's catching the fish and were would be great. Thanks!!   Ryan"
