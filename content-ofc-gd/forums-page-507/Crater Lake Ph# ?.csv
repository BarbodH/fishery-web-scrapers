607684,rhymobot,2011-07-29 17:34:00,174,  I was just browsing a map and noticed this place and remember seeing 2 signs for it on the road in the past year or so. I did a google street view and saw the entrance sign with phone number and it said year round fishing. I just called that number and it belongs to someone at Best Buy office.  Being from Brampton I'm always looking for close by places to put my inflatable in and fish during the week. And on google satellite view it looks like there's boats in the water. It would be nice if this place was open but I'm guessing it's closed up.
