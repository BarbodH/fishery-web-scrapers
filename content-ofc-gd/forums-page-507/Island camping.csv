607407,hunterjoe84,2011-07-29 00:14:00,52,I am looking to take my wife and dogs island camping within 4 hrs from peterborough for a 4 day weekend in September. I have a tinny with a 15 hp that I will be taking.  I have never been island camping before but really want to give it a try.  I am an avid angler who loves to target walleye.  I am willing to pay for access however free tent camping would be preferred. Anyone have any suggestions for lakes to check out?  If you don't want to post pm's are appreciated.  Thanks

I have 26 acres of waterfront you're welcome to use and make all the noise you like, or can also suggest a few islands further down the lake.  How big is the boat?  Free launch, free parking and free camping. Leaves a lot of money for BEER!"
