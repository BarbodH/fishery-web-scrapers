So I decided to try some other areas and put together a pattern... I ended up finding 3 new spots and landed 8 walleye and a couple smallies... The biggest walleye was 27.5 inches... About 7+ pounds...  Today it was saddles and points that produced for me... It was a long day trying to pattern with only one line... But in the end I enjoyed the challenge... And it felt good boating 8 walleye on spots I don't normally fish...  Sorry no picks... I'll have to get a lesson from ""jigs"" on self photos on the boat by yourself...lol"
