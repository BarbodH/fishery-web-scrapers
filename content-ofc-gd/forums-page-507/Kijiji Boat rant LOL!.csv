607393,Rustic-Fisher,2011-07-28 23:34:00,826,"Kijiji/charter boat ad LOL....  Made arrangements for a viewing of my boat+water test,  meet the potential  buyer at  the town launch to take the boat out for a ride. As I arrive I am greeted by two guys with rods in hand standing around their hitchless honda civivc(wonder how they were taking the rig home)  . Quote of the night........""you mind if we fish for awhile??""  Now if this deal had been brokered through a board such as this I may of been in, but REALLY who does that LOL. Anyways figured it would be good for a laugh or two  R"
607395,Bill Shearer,2011-07-28 23:38:00,456,"There are jerks everywhere, and more since the kijiji type sites have existed. Comes with the territory"

607397,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-28 23:40:00,10439," Answer: ""Not at all that will be $60 per person per hour in advance"""
607398,Fish Farmer,2011-07-28 23:40:00,2234,That was easy to figure out. They wanted to make sure your boat can catch fish.
607401,Terry,2011-07-28 23:48:00,14456,but...but...but....when my boat was broken that's how I got my fishing in.......   LOL   I can't believe someone would do that
607408,misfish,2011-07-29 00:22:00,29133,"I could go on and on about the crap from KIJIJI. It,s a joke.  Im putting my boat down at the marina this weekend. It,s Kempnfest longweekend. Maybe it will go.   If not,Im rigg,n it up.frigit  Did my own edit ."
607412,Rustic-Fisher,2011-07-29 00:30:00,826," Brutal hey Brian, I think mine just turned into a waterfowl boat!"
607414,Rustic-Fisher,2011-07-29 00:31:00,826,"Yep all you can do is laugh, I have a funny feeling my face said it all though LOL!"
607416,BillM,2011-07-29 00:35:00,17367,I would have said 'Sure!' after they handed over a nice fat deposit.
607417,misfish,2011-07-29 00:39:00,29133,"Hey Ryan.were headed to my parents place Friday and Sat,but back for sunday AM if you want to go out with the kiddies and wife. Just bring PFD,s."
607434,cranks bait,2011-07-29 01:10:00,721,"  In that case can I see your boat sometime in October?  Maybe we'll bring the guns?????  I've never heard of that happening before, insane.  I have sold two boats and both of them I have sold to members here on the board.  Sadly neither time we had time to go fishing."
607437,misfish,2011-07-29 01:21:00,29133,  
607456,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-29 02:09:00,1107,That's crazy and I thought the couple no show's I had were bad should have took them out and dropped em off on a island
607506,RyanT,2011-07-29 03:51:00,72,So... what did you tell those goofs?     
607573,Rustic-Fisher,2011-07-29 13:00:00,826," Never been a good poker player, kinda wear my emotions on my face, and I think they read em pretty good. literally laughed in their faces, and asked what they were towing the boat with. After a few min of small talk it was obvious there was no intention to purchase the boat thus no water test. I should have launched right as they were leaving LOL."
607576,Rustic-Fisher,2011-07-29 13:05:00,826," Thanks, would love to but we're headed North on that day, should be a great day on the water though."
607578,Jds63,2011-07-29 13:16:00,1365,That is unreal !! ... nothing surprises me anymore
607583,eman,2011-07-29 13:34:00,101,kind of Ballsy!
