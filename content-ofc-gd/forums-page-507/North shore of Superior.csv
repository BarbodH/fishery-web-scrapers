Any tips? I'm thinking lakers in the lake, perhaps specks or bow in the Pic river? I would love to get on some area rivers or inland lakes as well. As always, feel free to PM if you don't want to make it public.  Thanks all."

I can't help you with the inland lakes, but Mink creek has some very nice water falls on the south side of the hwy...it might be worth a visit.  "
