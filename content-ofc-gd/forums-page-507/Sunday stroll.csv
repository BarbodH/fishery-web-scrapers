Had one monster smallie that I could not land. I was standing on a 12' wall, so I just shook him off at the wall. Beyond that the rest were all 1/2 to 1 1/2lb. Of course a bass outing isn't complete without the ever reliable WGSF attacking a bass lure.   Legs are feeling a wee bit worn now. Probably overdid it some, but it was worth it"
