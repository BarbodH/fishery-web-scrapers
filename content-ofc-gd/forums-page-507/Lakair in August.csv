607639,lew,2011-07-29 15:38:00,12766,I'm heading back up August 6 for another 2 weeks and just wondered if anyone else is gonna be there the same time ??
607641,danbouck,2011-07-29 15:39:00,4380,I was hoping to be but it's not happening. Just gonna spend 10 days at the cottage.
607643,John,2011-07-29 15:45:00,2956,I was hoping to be as you know Lew but Barbara's Dad is scheduled for surgery so we had to delay it...
607645,lew,2011-07-29 15:49:00,12766,"Was really sorry to hear we wouldn't be holidaying together again this year John but Barb's dad's health is much more important and best of luck to him. We'll be heading back up again next year and I'll give you the dates when I know them.  And Dan, too bad you can't make it either, woulda been fun."
607662,Slimeball,2011-07-29 16:26:00,30,"Hi Lew, I'll be on the Upper for two weeks August 11-27. Have you heard how the weed growth is progressing this year? Last August the weed growth was lacking to say the least.......on the Upper French anyhow. Good luck on the West Arm, have a safe trip. Jay"
607669,lew,2011-07-29 16:42:00,12766,Thanks Jay & good luck to you also.  Can't help you with the Upper but I know the water levels & weed growth were excellent in the West Arm in early June and I'm thinking it'll be even better now.  Just hoping the BIG girls are hungry
607752,motv8tr,2011-07-29 21:32:00,2587,ya never know when or where i might show up  If I don't see you I hope you and Dianne have a great time...  Maureen
