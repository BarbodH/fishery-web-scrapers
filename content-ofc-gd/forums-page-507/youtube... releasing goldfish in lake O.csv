607747,danjang,2011-07-29 21:24:00,148,I've seen a small 3-4 inch goldfish swimming along several steelhead in the spring. I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought it was some loose flagging tape. Hybrid steelhead/goldfish anyone!?
607759,spinnerbaitking,2011-07-29 22:00:00,1622,Reported E-Mail sent to MNR likely a waste of time but how know's SBK
607820,mike rousseau,2011-07-30 02:52:00,4661,Yup... No reply...
607913,Carp,2011-07-30 18:30:00,1488,"Watching people catch catfish and the odd little bass in a small lake (large pond) close to home. Then I see a bright orange flash on the end of someones line and a few seconds later, a decent sized Koi is landed.  Lots of condos and houses within a short walk of the lake. The Koi must have jumped out of their aquariums and flopped over to the lake all on their own."

605036,Joeytier,2011-07-21 12:40:00,3990,"I wish I had a picture of one I caught out of Lake Ontario a few years back.  The one I caught was a vivid orange, and there was a pure white one swimming along with it.  Not a very sporting fish"
605041,GBW,2011-07-21 12:45:00,8460,MNR tips email.  you never know...
605042,Gregoire,2011-07-21 12:47:00,1397,I think the worst part is that with warming water temperatures or in outflows of nuclear power plants these fish may be able to survive and screw up the ecosystem.
605043,Roy,2011-07-21 12:47:00,13728,Those fish won't make it. The toilet would have been more humane. If they really wanted to save them they should have given them to someone with a fish pond in the yard.
605044,bubbles,2011-07-21 12:48:00,591,"I have seen quite a few in the detroit river, there is a really shallow bay that holds goldfish and Koi......"
605059,GBW,2011-07-21 13:38:00,8460,
605062,mike rousseau,2011-07-21 13:42:00,4661,i emailed mnr geraneral email... they dont have a tips email... and i asked them either way to let me know if they have the resources to enforce violaters threw the internet... hopefully they get back to me about it and if they do... ill let everyone know
605064,Dondorfish,2011-07-21 13:56:00,1000,If you read the responces at the bottom - they go back at least 2 years - nothing will come of it - but good on you for trying.  Tracker ( Don )
605067,Dave Bailey,2011-07-21 14:07:00,1641,"Goldfish are just carp with bling, so sooner or later they will revert to the ones we see all over the place. But it still shouldn't be allowed."
605070,OutdoorDan,2011-07-21 14:15:00,325,Looking his other videos these people are from NY so I don't think the MNR will be able to do anything.
605074,Fisher_1,2011-07-21 14:36:00,22,"In some of the channels of the Detroit river theres at least 6 huge goldfish that have been released in there, plus about 3 large Koi. My buddy was tellin me one of the Koi would be worth about $300 and someone just put him there."
605086,OutdoorDan,2011-07-21 15:16:00,325,300$? Koi fish are like 5 bucks at Petsmart.
605089,John,2011-07-21 15:23:00,2956," Try buying a 12"" Koi for 5 bucks"
605090,OutdoorDan,2011-07-21 15:25:00,325,Well they can grow in the canals....
605093,OhioFisherman,2011-07-21 15:44:00,6623,"The only thing that keeps little goldfish from surviving? the majority of them get eaten! Pretty hard for them to survive when they are waving them bright colors in a predators face? I saw them all the time in Lake Erie, but only ones too big for most other fish to eat.  A lot of people put them in fish ponds here, the spring rains wash out the ponds and it all flows into Lake Erie around here. Like mentioned, all they are is carp, and I have seem carp at Pointe Au Baril, the cold most of us see won`t stop them."
605094,Billy Bob,2011-07-21 15:45:00,5865,"My buddy Walt from the fire hall has a old in ground pool that needs to be filled in...the liner is all rusted out...but years ago he put in some fish he thought were just gold fish but they turned out to be Koi....and now he has hundreds of them in that pool....another friend Pete from the fire hall put in a small back yard pond for his wife and called me to catch some of Walt's Koi....so a couple of weeks ago there I was with a cold beer in hand catching Koi for Peter....LOL.....many are over 6"" long, some have a lot of white marking and all the bigger ones have the LONG SPLIT tails.....when Walt feeds them at least 50-75 come up to the surface for the bread he throws in....they have been in there for a long time now....the pool is all green color water and the cover is sunk into about 3/4 of the pool making great cover for them....he say's once in a while a Blue Heron will come in and catch a couple.  Bob"
605113,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-21 17:12:00,2585,"i doubt they will survive, i also doubt anything will come from it as the video is a few years old  terrible thing though"
605114,craigdritchie,2011-07-21 17:18:00,1586,"They probably will survive - there are already hundreds, if not thousands, of goldfish in the Great Lakes.  Problem is, nothing will ever come if it because MNR or NYDEC will look at the cost of tracking these idiots down and prosecuting them, and know full well they'll get a maximum fine of about $100. It's just not worth the expense."
605211,tomO,2011-07-21 21:22:00,363,We use them for catfish bait on the ohio river.
605252,Billy Bob,2011-07-21 23:39:00,5865,"Garbage in, garbage out....."
605258,tomO,2011-07-22 00:03:00,363,"They call them baltimore minnows at the bait store and charge a $1 apiece go to walmart and get them for 25 cents. I've caught some pretty nice flat or shovel head catfish on them, biggest was 26 lbs. This is the time of year you start fishing for the big cats after dark as its so hot not much else is biting. Was out last week and the ohio river was 84 degrees."
605293,Rattletrap2,2011-07-22 02:11:00,1652,"I agree that is wrong to dump them in the lake, but as already mentioned, I doubt they will survive. We originally had three very large Goldfish in our pond. Eventually, they all died. These were just common Goldfish, not koi and they grew to approx. 5 pounds!!! These things were very fat and a joy to watch cruise around the pond. We could see them from our window in the kitchen.  I have bought some expensive fish from Bradford Nursery that were over 6"" long. They didn't last a week! We tried stocking with half a dozen fish several times. Some of these fish were $16.00 each! The Bass just annihilate them within days!! There is no where to hide when you are bright orange! LOL  I bought some 10 - 11"" trout and they didn't last either. I watched the Bass coral them into shallow water and just devour them.  I now have a pair of Goldfish we are trying to raise in a large cage. I still don't think they are big enough to compete with the Bass. They did survive all winter though!  If anyone has any real good size ones they don't want any longer, let me know."
605324,crossover,2011-07-22 04:31:00,172,The more humane thing would've been to give them to a pet store.
605331,Billy Bob,2011-07-22 11:00:00,5865," Yep, humans are the only ones that will flush them down the toilet..."
