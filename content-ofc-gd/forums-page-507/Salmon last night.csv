607592,bucktail,2011-07-29 13:56:00,1857,"Got out last night after work off of Bronte, east wind came up in the PM and started to make things kinda lumpy out there. i think what they say about winds from the east fish bite the least. Most fish we spotted where in the 120 to 140 ft mark 40-65 down. Marked alot of fish but lock jaw for us for the first few hours. Here is the best bait we found, worked it over 4 times I would love to see what this looks like on an HD-8 in downscan.    Finally around 7:30pm after draggng spoons we switched to SD and a fly in chratruese with white fly we had this one hit.     Just a hair shy of 40 inches but slim, fought like a much bigger fish as he hugged the bottom and dogged it out.  My best king of the year but then again I have been hitting the blue zone for the last month.  but like a bonehead I forgot to take a picture with my tourney sign!!!!!!  DOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!  Sorry team 4!  Darren"
607600,Pikeslayer,2011-07-29 14:12:00,1443,"Nice King Darren. And thx for the detail. I have yet to land a salmon on the wire, dipsey, SD & fly. 100% off spoons. The wire set up is the hot producer for us in the BZ though.  Slayer P.RTRD"
607603,Fang,2011-07-29 14:24:00,1330,Where'd you launch. I've been taking a few weeks off to do some more work on the basement reno but can't do any more until I get some electrical work done. I guess it's back out on the lake a few nights a week.  Nice big tail. I haven't had a chinook fight deep for a long time - all come right up to the surface. Those deep fights are awesome
607604,Gregoire,2011-07-29 14:26:00,1397," That's funny because we have had nothing hitting on the spoons, all on flies."
607617,lew,2011-07-29 14:43:00,12766,"Attaboy Darren, a very impressive fish for sure !!  Looks like you've really got your boat rigged up nice for downrigging  too."
607620,BFSC Kevin,2011-07-29 14:49:00,1351,"great catch bucktail.. too bad no sign! no worries, we'll get a better one"
607653,Joeytier,2011-07-29 16:10:00,3990,I missed my chance at a nice kicker fish for team 4 as well...nice fish regardless.
607705,bucktail,2011-07-29 18:33:00,1857,Thanks Guys  Lew... you dont get to see or smell it after a weekend of trolling worm harnesses on Erie!!  Yikes!
607715,johnnyb,2011-07-29 19:14:00,3413,"Nicely done, Darren!   I can hit Bronte in 30 mins....and I won't forget my sign  :D"
607762,Joey,2011-07-29 22:11:00,9122,"Another nice Salmon for you Darren.  Good stuff, can't wait to get back out there myself"
607781,lew,2011-07-29 23:46:00,12766, There's a good reason I don't ever use live bait Darren
607875,vinnimon,2011-07-30 14:52:00,2593, Good job Darren Hopefully this weekend I can haul in a King for team 4
