607602,mike rousseau,2011-07-29 14:22:00,4661,I started thinking about my trip to lake O for salmon... When I thought a trip trade might be better...  So I'm wondering if anybody wants to swap a day of musky fishing... Or walleye if you prefer... With me for a day of salmon fishing with you?  Both parties get what they want and it doesn't cost a fortune...  PM me if interested...

607608,mike rousseau,2011-07-29 14:32:00,4661,Cool  That was fast... Lol
607609,Pikeslayer,2011-07-29 14:35:00,1443,"Actually, when I saw your original post about Salmon info I was thinking about offering up a trade. But I wasn't sure after seeing Paul's results from the musky outing. His musky looked a little on the small side  Slayer P.RTRD"
607613,mike rousseau,2011-07-29 14:38:00,4661, well i only had 3 hours with paul...  and you have nothing to lose but a car ride...
607615,Pikeslayer,2011-07-29 14:42:00,1443,  Haaa! You know I was just kidding.  Looks like we have a date.
