607070,Leecher,2011-07-28 02:35:00,7832,"Great report, excellent fish and pics Corvy Congrats Leechman"
607329,corvette1,2011-07-28 19:50:00,1765,  thanks leech
607335,johnnyb,2011-07-28 20:37:00,3413,  Absolutely!  14 hrs of drivin leaves a solid 5 or 6 hrs to fish...and that's if you need a lot of sleep
607563,corvette1,2011-07-29 12:26:00,1765,johnny b it was less than 12 hours so your looking 7to 8 hours of fishing haha
606535,corvette1,2011-07-27 00:28:00,1765,"Just got back from Horwood Lake.  Went with Lund06 and my friend Rich.  Had a great week.  First trip ever it never rained during the day.  We had two bad thunder storms at night.  The first four days were awesome fishing and with the heat and storms at the end of the week it turned off and the fish went deep.  Most fish were caught on bottom bouncers, spinners with worms, bouncers with floating jigs and leeches.  We casted for pike with johnson silver minnows with pork.  Largest pike for the week was 37"" caught on a deep reef runner.  Big walleye for the week was 32"" caught on a bottom bouncer and worm.  Enjoy the pictures....   Lund06 with a 26"" eye  Corvette1 with a 32"" eye   37"" pike       Lund06 27""    leaving Horwood Lake  "

606685,4x4bassin,2011-07-27 14:22:00,1025,"Nice report and yes some good eyes for that area ! I fished in that area a couple years ago , we caught the train out of Foleyte and traveled north toward the game reserve.Alot of small stuff but nothing as big as these ones. Did you see any of the ""white moose""that the Foleyte area is famous for ?"
606688,ccmtcanada,2011-07-27 14:24:00,7971,Whoa!  Those were some big walleye there!  Looked like an awesome time...and you were dialed into the fish!
606689,fishnsled,2011-07-27 14:26:00,3520,Great report and really nice fish. Always great when a game plan comes together.
606697,LucG,2011-07-27 14:32:00,779,"That 32"" walleye is a monster!!!!  Nice catch!"
606707,adempsey,2011-07-27 14:50:00,1498,"Nice fish!  That 32""er must have been a real beast!   The largest fish we caught at our last Horwood trip was 26"" and it was really chunky.   We had a hard time finding the fish on our last trip, but still had some success.  Nice to see hear you did well.  Cheers."
606799,corvette1,2011-07-27 18:09:00,1765,  thanks wayne if you need a fishing partner for the day give me a shout  thanks 4x4 no moose of any color
606800,corvette1,2011-07-27 18:10:00,1765,thanks to every one it was a great trip
606806,eman,2011-07-27 18:25:00,101,nice fish! Horwood lake is quite far for me. I'm surprised so many of you have been there.
606838,solopaddler,2011-07-27 19:30:00,8605,  Horwood lake is close as far as I'm concerned.  Anywhere you can drive to and drop a big boat in that's less than a 7 hour drive from home is almost a day trip.
606887,kuhaman,2011-07-27 20:34:00,503,Great report. I haven't fished Horwood since I was a kid. Seems the fishing is still as good as I remember it.
