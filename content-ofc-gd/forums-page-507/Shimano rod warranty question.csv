607272,WeedLine,2011-07-28 17:35:00,322,"Hey guys/gals, quick question. Will shimano replace a V-Rod baitcast rod? The rod is discontinued and has a broken tip. Thanks for any info. Hope everyone is having a great summer fishing season"

607279,WeedLine,2011-07-28 17:52:00,322,Thanks Spiel
607287,Spiel,2011-07-28 18:01:00,9065,"Not a problem, it's the quickest route to answer your question.  In the past they've been pretty good to me."
607295,WeedLine,2011-07-28 18:11:00,322,They just told me that they can't do anything for me. It was a great rod and caught some big fish for me. Too bad
607297,Spiel,2011-07-28 18:13:00,9065," Too bad indeed, I know that they've being going through a lot of changes recently with their warranty program. I suspect it was getting costly."
607306,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-28 18:37:00,4399,"There was a rather lenghy post here last year I believe about a member try to make a warranty claim for a V rod, if memory serves the Canadian office was not willing to do anything but oddly enough the American office was willing to honor the warranty. Can`t remember the member who started the thread or what the outcome was!"
607317,GBW,2011-07-28 19:13:00,8460,you mean this post?  page 3 from jedi... http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=44828&st=40
607322,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-28 19:25:00,4399,That would be the one!
607325,jim,2011-07-28 19:35:00,124,damn!!  I guess we'll all have to start buying St. Croix's!!  Did you hear that Shimano?!

607334,irishfield,2011-07-28 20:26:00,26272,Broken tip.. cut it clean and put a new tip on for less than the postage !
607345,WeedLine,2011-07-28 21:21:00,322,Thanks for all the help guys.
607385,cranks bait,2011-07-28 23:27:00,721,"Broken tip.. cut it clean and put a new tip on for less than the postage !   My thoughts as well.  If the rod is that old and the tip just broke, pretty much garunteed it's not a manufacture defect.  I did this to a Crucial and I cannot notice a difference."
607392,irishfield,2011-07-28 23:32:00,26272,I did it to a $600 custom Musky rod.. that had blank replacement coverage!! Expecting manufacturers to cover stuff like this just costs everyone money.
607413,WeedLine,2011-07-29 00:30:00,322,The tip is broken all the way to the second guide. There is nowhere to add a new top guide.
607623,Harrison,2011-07-29 14:55:00,2202, Perfect.  There is your new 2oz jig slop punching rod.
607685,craigdritchie,2011-07-29 17:44:00,1586,"Carefully cut it off at the base of the second guide and enjoy your new, heaver action rod."
