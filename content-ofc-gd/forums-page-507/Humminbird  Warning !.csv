607549,Fish Farmer,2011-07-29 11:59:00,2234,"Fisherman, your tellin your age OH! The good old days. Funny though, we caught more fish when their was no such thing as a depth finder. First depth Finder I had was a anchor rope with knots at so many feet."

607558,Billy Bob,2011-07-29 12:12:00,5865," YEP, I do remember the different drinking ages back then....but you have to get into the early 70's for me....not that old...LOL  Funny how the ages got turned around for both areas....and I remember going deer hunting in PA when I was 20 years old and I couldn't go to a tavern with my hunting buddy who was 2 years older then me.....Eddy had to buy the beer at the bar and bring it back to our hunting trailer....but the following year I made up for it...."
607561,Fish Farmer,2011-07-29 12:20:00,2234,"Back then Roy, I carried lots of shear pins. If I ran out, a nail worked in a pinch. Can't remember how many times I filed and hammered the prop. The Skeg was another story But it was a 10HP, before they came out with the 9.9 rule registration."
607565,John,2011-07-29 12:36:00,2956,"I have a Humminbird 958c (combo) and have had zero problems or interference with marine radio (Raymarine). I can say nothing but good things about it in the two years I have had it. You don't have to be a techie to use it, very simple, very good graphics, good resolution.  It's the old Ford/Chevy debate............ IMO"

But I would love to have an HD-8!! Never owned enough to be able to make a decison, but having to pitch out the 32 bucks is like them rubbin your nose in it.  D"
607923,Twocoda,2011-07-30 20:15:00,4130,i went out last night with a buddie that just bought the same unit ...his VHF is a uniden and there was zero interference ....it was my first time playing with the machine and honestly i found it to be rather user friendly but im sure i could have set it up better if i had the manual to read...all in all i thought it was a decent buy for the price.... the thing that i wasnt paticularily fond of was...the sensor that automatically illuminates the finder takes along time to get the screen bright enough to see until its pitch black on the water but then again ....i didnt have the manual so mabe there was an adjustment for this
607980,Carp,2011-07-31 01:50:00,1488,I've been using my Lowrance sonar & GPS unit for over 20 years and I love it. My bro has a 20 year old Eagle unit and it still works like day one.  No experience with Hummingbird.
608045,Fish Farmer,2011-07-31 13:08:00,2234,"Switch to the advance setting, you can brighten the screen. I must have gotten one of the ones that they forgot to install the part. Service new about the problem. and fixed mine and others. I do like the machine, very user friendly. Plus I bought the FishNChip for it."
608050,outllaw,2011-07-31 13:20:00,1232,birds plain suck. everyone i know has dumped them decades ago. lowrance has been the best results for guys in southern ont.
608064,dave524,2011-07-31 14:26:00,4508,"I'd be curious as to the serial numbers and date of manufacture by the sounds of how this is going, betting the problem cropped up and was modified on later units of affected models. Funny how in fishfarmer's case and the video I posted in the original thread there seemed to be no hesitation on Hummingbird's part, send it in and we'll fix it up , like they knew exactly what to do"
608069,Dabluz,2011-07-31 15:31:00,701,"I've had a whole bunch of Humminbird sonar units.  From the LCR1000 to two 3-D units and not one worked right or worked for very long.  My best sonars are two very ancient flasher units made by Lowrance.  They can even tell me how deep the water is in a 5 gallon bucket.  As for fish detection with any sonar unit.....you simply cannot rely on what the unit detects.  On top of that, if there really is a fish under your boat....is it a sportfish?  If there really is a sportfish under your boat....will it bite?  When you get right down to it, sonars are way overrated in importance.  When fishing for walleye, it's a hit or miss situation.  Most of the time, walleye are usually caught in an area about the size of a couple of kitchen tables and these spots are almost always found by looking with your eyes."
608079,Billy Bob,2011-07-31 16:58:00,5865, May be true on smaller inland lakes but your sonar and GPS will find LOTS of walleyes suspended and on the bottom in Lake Erie.....but then it's still your job to get them to bite...
608106,Fish Farmer,2011-07-31 19:11:00,2234,"That is why I call them Depth Finders, some may laugh, but thats basically what they are. What you see on the screen is what you want to think it is. What ever passes between your trans and bottom you may think it's a fish. Suspended leaves,weeds,stick,garbage bags, and you name it fish. Some even tell you what type of fish is on the screen, because that's what they hope they are. I'm guilty of doing the same, hoping all the marks I'm getting are the fish I'm targeting, when low and behold I've stayed on top of a school of Drum.  . Just think of the species of fish on the lake your fishing, and tell yourself, I hope that's what I think it is. Because there is no rule to a fish that wants to eat, what Temp or fences under the water, meaning, fish will be were you least expect. I've caught fish Subzero,Hot days, Top or bottom or halfway. If I'm hungry, I'll eat any time. If I go to a Buffet and eat till I can't bend over, I don't want to see food for another week. Fish are the same. But I'd sooner eat my buffet indoors. I'm going Walleye fishing tomorrow on Erie, every mark on my screen is going to be a Walleye, I hope If you see me out there, don't follow me, because you may only catch Sheephead"
608111,Fish Farmer,2011-07-31 19:29:00,2234,"Dave, I think your right on. Maybe some models are made in a different country or quality control. I'm just hoping, like a few guys have said, their garbage. I hope mines not  . To late now, keep my fingers crossed."
607154,Fish Farmer,2011-07-28 13:50:00,2234,"Just a little advise. If your buying a Humminbird Depth Finder GPS Combo and have a VHF Radio, the Humminbird will cause static on your VHF radio. Should have the warning on the box. I bought the unit thinking all was good but not so. After trying 100 different ways to stop the static with no results with some ideas from Humminbird and some electronics shops. 2 weeks later, pulling my hair out. Humminbird tells me to send it to their service depot in North Bay by Purolator because they know whats wrong. The service tech says he has the Part for unit, and when you get it back the static will be gone. So off to Purolator it goes, $32.00 it cost ME to ship. 3 days later I got my machine back. Great fast service, but why, in the first place. If they new what the problem was, why the run-around. Should be a call back on their machines. I called Humminbird to see if I get reimburse my shipping cost and they said sorry,they can't. Seems like, we the consumer, are tackle testers for there products at our expense. Would I buy another Humminbird?  OH, and yes, no more static."
607161,Fisherman,2011-07-28 13:59:00,7201,"That's why I said right from the start, it's an inferior product, and like you said, that should be addressed while they are building them and put the interference filter into the unit, not something as an fix after you annoy the customer at his cost."
607171,fishnsled,2011-07-28 14:17:00,3520,"Haven't bought a Humminbird product in years. Was very disappointed that the transducers on the units I had been using would only last a couple of years Then to replace the transducer was almost the same price as a new unit. Bought Eagle units and they have been fine for the last 7 years or so. Almost bought a Humminbird GPS a couple of years ago but went with a Lowrance.  After reading your post, I'm glad I did as I've no issue with mine. Having said that I know others have had issues with Lowrance. Your problem seems to be something they are well aware of. However, if you are not running a VHF radio, you would not be aware of any static issues. They are most likely thinking, we'll fix the ones that come back and in our next product we'll fix the issue...or maybe not. All about the bottom line.  Thanks for the heads up."
607194,canadadude,2011-07-28 14:56:00,769,"At least they fixed the problem,unfortunatly we don't live in a perfect world,recalls on products happen all the time and I relize it can be very frustrating but they got your unit back to you in 3days.I would be delighted with that kind of service,it seems to me Hummingbird has very good customer service but you can't please everyone. I'm sure the problem has been adressed at the factory, unfortunatly some of units probably got into the market place."
607214,F_ast,2011-07-28 15:36:00,154,"I understand the static issue but not sure what you are complaining about... 3 day turn around is fantastic.  Have you ever tried to deal with Lowrance.  That is something to fall on the ground and laugh about.  Sounds like HB fixed you right up.  Maybe they should install whatever they did on all units, but I'd say that the average boater with VHF radio vs with is only like 1 in 100. Maybe less.  Humminbird makes some of the best stuff on the planet IMO."
607219,Roy,2011-07-28 15:52:00,13728,Glad they fixed you up Dave but I'm still a Lowrance guy.
607237,Terry,2011-07-28 16:23:00,14456,"years ago I was given Humminbird as part of a sponsorship  I tried it out ,it marked fish I knew there were no fish..I was trying it in a swimming pool the depth was wrong took it out on the lake same thing, always marked fish, depth was off most of the time in 15 ft of water is wa showing 25ft even after hanging all the setting  took it back and told the thanks but no thanks, I had heard they have gotten much better over the years"
607241,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-28 16:29:00,10439, I also had an HB back in the 80's and was not impressed at all. I know they have gotten better but I can't get passed my initial impression of them back in the day. Also my Lowrance doesn't interfere with my VHF.
607248,Fish Farmer,2011-07-28 16:43:00,2234,"OH, that's great, 2 years. Thanks for the heads-up fishnsled. Can you believe I like the unit, but now I wish I never read your reply  I did notice their transducer cable goes in the other side, opposite from Lawrence  Don't get me wrong, I do like the unit and 3 days I was impressed. But at least they should have reimbursed my $32.00 for my problem. (their problem) Hay, that's $32 bucks I could have spent on fishing Gas or.  That will teach me Roy for jumping ship. I've had Lawrence for years. When I think about it, I bought the old Lawrence Green Box flasher back in the days. Plus that $32.00 would have been a good after noon for me and Spiel"

607299,fishnsled,2011-07-28 18:18:00,3520," They may have improved quite a bite since I've owned one, don't count them out yet. As others have said - they fixed you up pretty quickly.    Wimmen??? Where do you find a women for $32?? Hamilton you say...."
607331,Billy Bob,2011-07-28 20:02:00,5865,Years ago I sent in my Humminbird flasher for repairs with a check included in the box....they wrote back that they received my flasher unit but no payment was included....I called them and around and around we went...finally had to put a stop order on the check and send them another check...then they sent me someone else's in dash unit instead of my Super 30 unit....called them and they said send it back to them....I said send me my unit first plus the cost of my stop order check....they refused but my unit arrived the next day......I eventually sold that in dash unit MANY years later on Ebay.......that was the end of my business with a Bird Company.
607346,lew,2011-07-28 21:29:00,12766,"I told you they'd fix you up fast Dave, those boyz in North Bay give out some excellent customer service.  Too bad about the $32 but I understand that doesn't buy many beers these days anyhoo"

I see waranty if they (hummingbird)buggered with it and corrected the issue Consumers and tackle testers? do you pitch your lures at your ff Dave? Not! Ask them the same Bull walks on both sides of the street I say, esp on the marketing end to save a buck or two. Dave send those good folks this thread, Geeze would I buy another one, not on gods earth again. My 535 portable lies to me in gin clear water.

Are you running the sonar and the VHF off the same battery?  another reason for static...  I also notice when my gauges are off my compass on the dash reads out of whack, shut the key off and it goes right...  What sonar unit Dave?"

Fishfarmer , glad you got it fixed up,if Hummingbird wants to play in the blue water offshore market there going to have to their act together, may not be important in the bassboat market but that kind interfernce going to give them a bad rap in the bigger boat market"

Thanks, I'm glad it's fixed, the noise was driving me and my buddy crazy. We had to turn the radio off. I've heard some of their units don't bother VHF radio's"
