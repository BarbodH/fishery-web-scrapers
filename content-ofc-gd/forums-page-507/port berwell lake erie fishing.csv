607596,HTHM,2011-07-29 14:01:00,4082,"Apparently the walleye are east of Port BUrwell, (it is a ""u"" not ""e""), 60 - 70 FOW. Good luck!"
607631,Woodsman,2011-07-29 15:08:00,1286,"Hint: Think pink, 30'-40' down over 58-62 fow early in the day (ie; before 9). After that much longer leads on downriggers or 10 & 7 colour leadcore. Pinks are still good but orange & black (greasy chicken) also produce. getting off to the sides of the boat(planner boards or dipseys) or far back on riggers (up to 200') seem to help as the day progresses. Will also get bows & farm animals. Here's a few from last Sat.    Good Luck: Rick"

608061,Woodsman,2011-07-31 14:01:00,1286,"Good to hear you had a great day. Nice fish. We were out of Port Bruce yesterday & fished from the west of Port Bruce to over off Port Burwell mostly in 59-62 fow. Between the two of us we landed 6 walleye (3 each) & lost one rainbow. 4 off dipseys (mixed veggies) & 2 off riggers (green monkey puke). I got 2 like this at 28"". "
608065,lplp,2011-07-31 14:29:00,83,"This was the first time ever fishing lake erie ,, and I was impressed with it,, problem is kind of far to go every day,, we are about 1 1/2 hr. away ,, so it wont be a trip we will make all the time .Glad I experienced it and kind of see why it is so busy out there .Probable going to martin river in a couple of weeks ,and next year we are planning trout lake."
608119,Canuck2fan,2011-07-31 20:07:00,1444,One way to make it more worth your while is to stop and limit out on perch on your way back in LOL.
608147,lplp,2011-07-31 22:14:00,83," We were pretty well done by then and yes that would of been a good idea, but my buddy bought 4 lbs of perch from the store at marina there,, ."
608153,dave524,2011-07-31 22:34:00,4508," Saw on another board, 7 guys , 7 rods, 350 perch, 89 pounds of filets   somewhere down in the central basin of Erie, yep that should cover the gas."
