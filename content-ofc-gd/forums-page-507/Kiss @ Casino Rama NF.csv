606989,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-27 23:34:00,4399,Nope not me never was much of a Kiss fan but I am going to Rama next Wednesday to see ZZ Top!!!
607003,smally21,2011-07-28 00:08:00,993,"who was there? i don't mean in the crowd, just wondering what members would hit a RAMA show. a great time no matter what i bet! i'm more than a little jealous....i hope you rocked and rolled all night."
607011,Roy,2011-07-28 00:23:00,13728,"For ZZ TOP, I'll go.  <iframe width=""640"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/HH85zttgbGg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
607014,bigugli,2011-07-28 00:30:00,6138,There have been some great shows at Rama. My kid brother was probably there in his kitty face
607025,Live2fish85,2011-07-28 00:55:00,1633,I would love to ZZ Top I may have to talk to my dad if ZZ Top is going to be there Wed.
607027,bucktail,2011-07-28 01:05:00,1857,Got to see James Brown just before he passed away....awesome...also saw George Calin just before he passed away....maybe i should stop going!!
607066,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-28 02:29:00,4399, I think the show is sold out!
607089,adolson,2011-07-28 04:09:00,783, I'd like to see this guy even more than ZZ Top themselves:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DVbt5W-DNc
607093,Live2fish85,2011-07-28 04:24:00,1633, Well doesn't that just suck lol. I guess I could start watching T.V. more or listening to the radio but it's summer and would rather be out fishing lol. I guess it's my fault I seem to miss things.
607109,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-28 10:54:00,4399,  I think I`d rather see ZZ!  You might want to take down that u tube link made my puter do some bad things!!!
607267,John,2011-07-28 17:23:00,2956, Now you're talkin'
607277,fishnsled,2011-07-28 17:50:00,3520,"I'm not a big Kiss fan but a buddy had an extra ticket when they played in Oshawa. I couldn't believe those guys were still doing all the crazy stuff they were doing. Simons and Stanley flying around the stage and arena, tons of pyrotechnics, spitting ""blood"" and fire, just a great stage show. Don't know that I'd drop $100 bucks to see them again but it was worth it to see them once.  Yep, I'd take ZZ Top over Kiss."
607362,workwear,2011-07-28 22:39:00,592,ok DANA that was just cruel!!!!!!!
607374,misfish,2011-07-28 23:03:00,29133,"Hey Rob. We go when the parents get free tickets. Kiss they didnt have,but if did,Betty and I would of been there. My sister has seen ZZ and said they are the best. Mudder and pop seen Trace Atkins and said it was way to loud and people were leaving very early.Bad stage set up.   Were waiting to to see the rat pack when they come back.   BTW How the fishing?"
607410,shane,2011-07-29 00:29:00,652,I saw KISS way back in 1970 something here in London. I had never heard of them back then and only went because I knew the promoter and got free tickets.  Only concert I ever walked out on.
607420,misfish,2011-07-29 00:44:00,29133, Couldnt see the stage for all the smoke? Dont blame ya.
607655,kingofthesteelhead,2011-07-29 16:14:00,140,"As a longtime KISS fan,anybody who slanders them or TRIES to compare them to anyone,you need to go see them live and then see what you think. I have seen a lot of shows and just saw MOTLEY CRUE in June of this year and can honestly say they also have an awesome show!"
607725,Spiel,2011-07-29 19:39:00,9065, Their stage show might have some merit if they had perhaps one good song in their repetoire.....
607732,Cast-Away,2011-07-29 20:05:00,790,I go to see Roger Hodgson every November. He sounds better on his own with his mini band and the Rama orchestra than Supertramp did when I saw them in 1978!
607757,kingofthesteelhead,2011-07-29 21:51:00,140,ever see them live or do you like country music?
607766,bigugli,2011-07-29 22:20:00,6138,Got to admit that if I wanted to watch the costume show there was always Friday nights at the Roxie Theatre.
