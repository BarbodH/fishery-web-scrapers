607626,Billy Bob,2011-07-29 14:57:00,5865," MANY reel repair guys also repair trolling motors....you can also Google Minn Kota for service areas in your area.  Edited to add: ROCKEY'S TACKLE SERVICE INC. 10 BRAMMER DRIVE ORILLIA, ON L3V 7T4 705-325-3526 705-325-8161 [email protected] This is the closest one according to Minn Kota's website.... Bob"
607634,Ron,2011-07-29 15:22:00,1683,There is an authorized Minnkota repair shop just off of Brock Rd. in Pickering as well. The name escapes me but I hope someone else will know the name of the joint.
607636,Billy Bob,2011-07-29 15:26:00,5865," Would this be the one (also shows on Minn Kota's site)  BOAT TECH 1058 COPPERSTONE DRIVE UNIT 2 PICKERING, ON L1W 3V8 905-686-5008 905-686-5009 [email protected]"
607651,Ron,2011-07-29 16:00:00,1683," Yup, that's the one.  Grant Mills, super nice guy he is.  Cheers, Ron..."
607667,Garnet,2011-07-29 16:34:00,2056,"Grant or Rocky will mail that part to you. ""BUT"" that wheel on the motor head will take serous head scratching to get it right.  I would be waiting at Rocky's door about 7:30am with my best puppy dog look and Rocky will usually fix you up. And he likes beer!"
607675,mark02,2011-07-29 17:06:00,27,I have the same Minnkota. I would take it to Rocky in Orillia.  Highly recommended.
607776,dada2727,2011-07-29 23:18:00,108,"thanks for the replies guys, the cable isn't broken, just a strand.  I just wanted a spare for when it eventually does happen, I can do the repair on the lake and not waste a trip.  I'll check that place out in pickering, thx."
