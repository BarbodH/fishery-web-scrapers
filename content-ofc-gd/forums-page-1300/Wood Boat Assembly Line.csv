14233,TJQ,2006-12-19 22:26:00,7806,I can say I grew up with so many of those boats that I didnt even know they were made locally.  I just thought that was the way it was... great to have you on board!!
14236,Gerritt,2006-12-19 22:28:00,6129,I dont know about the rest of you guys.... but I would love to see a ton more photos!!!  very interesting!  Gerritt.
14237,Bernie,2006-12-19 22:29:00,3190,Thanks TJ....Hope to see you down at the French next summer. I will check to see it is ok to post more pics
14245,TJQ,2006-12-19 22:43:00,7806,"  Do you have any ""historical"" pics.. that would be what I would be interested in seeing!!"
14246,Bernie,2006-12-19 22:45:00,3190,Yep..probably hundreds if I looked hard. I will see what I come up with...Its a long winter. 
14261,lew,2006-12-19 23:02:00,12767,"Nippissing, here's a couple old pics you may be interested in.  I posted this one recentely but you may not have seen it. This is a 15' Peterboro Boat that my  dad bought back in the mid 50's and kept for about 8 years.  Interesting to note that my dads boat had the steering wheel on the left side of the boat, as compared to the right side in modern boats, and it was also located in the rear seat, which was quite common back then.    And this one was owned by a family friend, also in the 50's and I think it was 16'  Both excellent boats !!  "
14303,Bernie,2006-12-20 00:58:00,3190,Hi Lew..The peterboro boat lines were beautiful.The ribs nicely rounded off and well  finished. But I think it also increased their production costs at a time when aluminum and glass boats were becoming popular. Its really too bad. The boat shop still gets these in for repairs. I think they are the only ones around that still do extensive repair on these old craft. You should see some of the old stuff they get in for repair. Some are  from the early 1900s. They do have a web site for those who may be interested. www.gieslerboats.ca/
14336,fishindevil,2006-12-20 01:51:00,6254,"yes i would love to see lots of old pics as well,that is really important history of boating & fishing in ontario...keep them comming nipissing,if i ever came into money i would love to have one just for pleasure boating that would be cool,nothing feels like a wooden boat ride from what ive been told"
14396,sirfish,2006-12-20 04:28:00,175,Wow does that bring back memories. I had the pleasure of watching the craftsmen at work there about 20yrs ago when we stayed at a cottage on lake wistawasing or wasi lake. We had one of the thier 18ft boats with us at the time. Awesome craftsmanship. Great to see that your gr father is still at it. How about you?
13889,Bernie,2006-12-19 02:49:00,3190,Hello everyone. Just thought I would send a couple pics on the assembly line up here where I live. This is my first attempt at posting pics. Thanks for your patience if it doesn't work.  1 more pic  I will get this right yet!   
13902,tjsa,2006-12-19 03:05:00,1578,"Darn.............that looks like ..................work, lol."
13903,Nemo,2006-12-19 03:06:00,727,Wow nice boats. I have built a cedar strip canoe before and just love wooden boats.  How many are you building and what lengths are they?
13904,Bernie,2006-12-19 03:09:00,3190,After building them since 1928 they have it down pat now. One of my uncles is 85 and still works on them 8 to 5 every day.
13906,irishfield,2006-12-19 03:10:00,26272,"Love seeing that ""Old school"" is still in !"
13908,Bernie,2006-12-19 03:14:00,3190,They mostly build them for tourist outfitters and the build from canoes to 21 footers.  We have a 18 footer that the bottom was fiberglassed  and is as old as me. Im almost 50. Its been in the water every summer.We use it for trolling on Hunters Bay in Nipissing and hauling stuff to the cottage.
13953,Nemo,2006-12-19 05:02:00,727,Nice to see.  Western or Eatern Cedar?  I hope when I am 85 I have something as cool as that to do.
13960,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 06:04:00,3382,Are those the ones they have at Lakair?
13962,sturgman,2006-12-19 08:02:00,249,"Sweet looking boats Nipissing.   I have owned 2 Geisler boats that were handmade in Powassen buy the Geisler family..There is no better rough water boat that travels lake Nipissing..   After building them since 1928 they have it down pat now. One of my uncles is 85 and still works on them 8 to 5 every day.  Rick, im bettin money that the boats at lakair are ""geisler"" boats..They are the jewels of Lake Nipissing!!   Awesone pics nipissing"
13963,Bob,2006-12-19 09:29:00,370,Is that whitetail head with the massive non typical rack still hanging in the office there?  I remember counting the points on it once (or trying to) but I don't remember how many there were.  That was 30 some years ago.  I too had one of those boats when I lived in Port Loring.
13968,pikehunter,2006-12-19 10:57:00,1659,A true art form. Thanks for posting.
13991,yellowboat,2006-12-19 13:10:00,211,Looks similar to a Peterborough Zepher.
14010,lew,2006-12-19 13:49:00,12767,"Aluminum & fiberglass are nice, but they don't even come close to the style and craftmanship of the cedarstrip.  Really nice to see a few companies continuing the history and tradition of them.  Thanks for posting those pictures Nippising"
14017,Roy,2006-12-19 14:04:00,13728,"Yes, those are the same boats at Lakair (and other Nipissing lodges and camps). You want to rinse you eyes on some of the beauties in the link below. I love that stuff.  http://www.portcarlingboats.com/Muskoka%20...0for%20Sale.htm"
14019,BITEME,2006-12-19 14:12:00,1969,Man that brings back Memories for me my family is from Cape Sable Island Nova Scotia My grandfather was the last of the Wooden Cape Island builders I spent many a day in my youth setting nails and helping to bend boards from the steamers and all sorts of things to keep a young lad occupied there are still templates in the barn  VERY NICE WORK NICE TO SEE CRAFTSMEN STILL EXIST IN THE COPY AGE  Cheers Peter
14020,John,2006-12-19 14:13:00,2956,I have spent many hours in one of those. Incredible workmanship.
14021,bpsbassman,2006-12-19 14:18:00,941,Great post.  Great art! Refreshing to see. Thanks.
14027,Entropy,2006-12-19 14:33:00,747,"Rogerson's (now Tornado's) used to buy them (Port Loring), beautiful boats.  What is the name of the company?  (I think I used to know)..."
14071,Bernie,2006-12-19 16:10:00,3190,Hello everyone. Glad you enjoyed the pics. My Grandfather started building in the late 20s a boat for himself to fish in. His buddy wanted one too. So he built another one. His buddy had an outboard motor that had broken. So he traded the boat for the broken outboard. He fixed the motor. More people came along and wanted a boat. And so it started. My father and his 3 brothers began working when they were teenagers. My dad started a service shop for the outboards back in 1972 and it snowballed into a thriving business as well. Lots of history that I could go on and on with but you are all probably bored by now. The deer antlers remain in the office by the way. And I do believe Lakair has some of the boats. B. Giesler & Sons is the original name of the company. I presently operate an automotive repair shop in our community. Take care.....Bernie G
14104,Peter Panfish,2006-12-19 17:31:00,46,"I love those boats, so many memories wouldn't happen if I didn't have one to take and rip around that lake in. And they've always been classier than aluminum imho."
14130,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 18:17:00,3382,The Giesler boats are legendary...last forever! Glad to have such a rich part of Nippissing history on the site!
14165,Terry,2006-12-19 19:36:00,14456,"they are so great, I wish I had a skill like that"
14185,Whopper,2006-12-19 20:43:00,2174,"Nice looking boats. Craft back in craftmanship!  The first time I went to Rice Lake back in the 70's there was a place called Whispering Pines (still there to) that had the cedarstrip boats and I thought they were awesome, absolutely beautiful boats.  When I was a small child we used to go to upstate New York for vacations and remember sitting on the dock outside the boat house and stared at a old Chris Craft that was gorgeous, thinking to myself one day when I grow up.......well still waiting to grow up  Whopper"
14204,fishindevil,2006-12-19 21:23:00,6254,"wow nipissing those pics are great thats an amazing piece of work ,and craftsmanship,that sure takes talent ,my grandfather had one to i do remember going fishing in it when i was a young kid,he also had a cedar strip canoe that i used to paddle it ,and it weighed a ton,   thats great that there are people still building those wonderful old boats,i bet they are very expensive too ...how much are they?????????"
14227,Bernie,2006-12-19 22:15:00,3190,"hi fishindevil. Im not real sure what they ask for the boats.It depends on how you want it built(deck size,with or with out well etc) but they are surprisingly inexpensive. Very low overhead and manufacturing costs make them very reasonable. If you are ever in the area you should stop in and check out the factory. Its like going back in time 60 years."
