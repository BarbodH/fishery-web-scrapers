14771,bigfish1965,2006-12-21 04:50:00,3382,"Edit the URL and it will create the proper scene for you. Right now, it is  The 'Merry%20Christmas%20OFNC%21' is the important part. '%20' represents a space and '%21' represents an exclamation mark. So just change what is in the rest of that part of the URL to match what you want it to say. Congrats..you now know how to hack a dynamic flash URL. When it works right, copy and paste the URL into an email and send it out. I would guess their email server gets slammed or was getting treated as a spam sender somewhere if you didn't get the email from their site."
