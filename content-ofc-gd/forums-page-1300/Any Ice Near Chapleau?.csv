14805,snackpack5150,2006-12-21 13:53:00,79,Which Lake are you heading too? I am heading up that way after christmas also but did check a lake I have fished before (Tunnel Lake) it is not frozen. The lake my cottage is on is west of Hwy 129 (Echo Lake) it too is not frozen. I would suggest calling Tunnel Lake trading post or a spot in Chapleau to see before you head up that way!!!   Merry Christmas
14814,thud,2006-12-21 14:11:00,5,I have a cabin on Nagasin Lake.  If we take hwy129 Tunnel Lake is a gas stop for us.  We mostly take the Sultan road.  I will be calling up there on Saturday but I find that safe ice to us southerns is different up there. Thanks
