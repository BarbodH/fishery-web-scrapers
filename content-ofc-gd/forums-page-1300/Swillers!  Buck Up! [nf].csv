14320,Mike the Pike,2006-12-20 01:26:00,3421,"Here some info about Canadian beer drinkers.   Yes we do like our beer.Mike        Canadian Beer Facts 1. The oldest brewery in North America is Molson's in Montreal where they have been brewing on site since 1786.  2. Believe it or not, the fact that Canadian beer is stronger than American beer is a fallacy. Canadians measure alcohol content by volume not weight, so when measured equally, Canadian beer is only a little bit stronger than American beer. (So really, it all boils down to the fact that Canadians can just out drink our American neighbours.)  3. In 2000, Canada sold enough beer to fill the SkyDome.  4. Per Capita, the lushes of the country are the Yukoners! In 2000, they drank an equivalent of 18 two-fours of beer per capita (followed by Quebckers at 11 and Newfoundlander at 10.5). (Good, so now I know whom not to challenge in a drinking contest!)  5. Canada holds the third highest tax rate in the world where 52% of the retail price of beer is various taxes. We fall behind Norway and Finland. This amounts to $550 million a year for the federal government and don't forget the GST which totals another 670 million. (Damn that sucks. I want my two-four for $16!)  6. Canadians like their bottles of beer. Approximately, 69% of our domestic beer is sold in bottles, 19% in cans and 12% in draught. (So... let's go back to the stubby so we get that extra 9ml.)  7. Nationally, 97% of all bottles and 86% of all cans are returned. (Every nickel and dime counts toward a new case!)  8. For beer consumption per capita in 2000, Canada ranked 17th in the world. (Top countries in the world are the Czech Republic, Ireland and Germany.)  9. More than 2 billion litres of domestic beer is consumed in Canada every year; we collectively spend more than $11 billion.  10. There are 100 transport trailers filled with Canadian beer travelling into the U.S. every week. (After all, the U.S. is our biggest export market for Canadian alcohol.)   from frymybacon.com"
