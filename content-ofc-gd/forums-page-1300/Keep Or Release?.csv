14315,GbayGiant,2006-12-20 01:17:00,1780,"I kept one walleye around 5lbs a couple weeks ago it was the smallest one I got all day so I decided to keep it, got home to clean it and it was already full of eggs, I was upset a little at myself but I figured it was the smallest one out of 12-15 fish and didn't look like it had eggs but you never know I guess."
14331,Moosebunk,2006-12-20 01:39:00,3970,"Keeping them.... feel bad.... nope.  Couple falls back though I released a pike of 36"", thought it was ready.  Nope.  By the time I pulled up anchor, turned and chased it, it sank in the fast murky current of the Moose.  I felt semi-bad."
14333,fishindevil,2006-12-20 01:41:00,6254,"i think that if im in a lake fishing say for lakers and as we all know most of the province has slot limits for lakers and on some lakes we have fished we can catch 5-10 lakers before we are able to keep one as they are all in the slot ,from now on im going to go barbless, its probably the best thing to do to slow down the mortality,as with lake trout ,they have a higher rate of dying especially in the summer when they come up from the depths....i think thats a good idea as lakers twist ,and twist and alot of the time they injure themselves before you can even get them off the hook,another thing is to keep the fish in the water as it will not take off any slime,or use a cradle or a rubber net as not to hurt the fish...cheers"
14343,FishFinder,2006-12-20 02:05:00,481,those numbers cant be accurate
14353,verno,2006-12-20 02:41:00,178,"I don't know who you are talking about but which ever mod it is certainly will.  Why not PM them if you have a problem with something they said before?  Or better yet, participate in that thread since it would apply to the subject.  Why bring something unrelated into someone elses thread?"
14375,keram,2006-12-20 03:42:00,585,"I do not feel bad in either case, I enjoy both"
14382,wishn4fishn,2006-12-20 04:00:00,108,"Yah,  I now regret keeping all those tasty brookies from my spots up north.  THe inner meathunter in me didnt think of the consequence and reality of harvesting a small population.  The much greater joy of consistently catching large quantities now outweight the deslicious red meat and flaky texture smothered in butter and dripping with lime juice.  Keep or Release??? Depends on how far and how much money was spent on the trip.  Algonquin, Thunder Bay, Barry's Bay all factor my decision if i'm lucky to connect with delicious specimens.  Good Thread."
14393,Crazyhook,2006-12-20 04:26:00,1154,personally I really enjoy eating fresh fish and when i do keep some fish i like the smaller ones
14394,bpsbassman,2006-12-20 04:27:00,941,"I probably release 98% of the fish I catch.  I keep the odd bass if we intend on having a fish fry. I have to admit that I really don't like cleaning/killing them.  Usually run the blade through their brain to hopefully put them out of their misery before filleting. The only time that I really feel bad is the odd time I'm cleaning a Smallie and after it's too late you realize it has worms.  Man that is a bummer. I don't understand why I never get a largemouth with worms, only smallies which logic would say should be the other way around given that smallies are usually in deeper, cooler water.  Can someone explain that?"
14397,bigfish1965,2006-12-20 04:31:00,3382,"Just a guess Roger, but if the worms are passed from fish to fish, it may be that the smallies are more social. Largies tend to be more solitary."
14407,Motorhead,2006-12-20 05:06:00,163,If it`s edible....  It`s going to be eaten .....Period  I fish for food not for fun.... nothing tastes better than fresh caught fish....   Doug
14411,carll2,2006-12-20 05:32:00,443,all musky..bass i release to swim another day as well as walleye 3lbs and over..i prefer the smaller ones unless im fishing on the lake where mt cottage is located and i know the walleye are just making a comeback i put everything back..only to see the neighbours fish and keep them...but a couple small fish kept for a fry never hurt anyone
14425,OhioFisherman,2006-12-20 09:47:00,6623,"Ya, it hit me in the early 80`s, just couldn`t see the need to keep them anymore. I have no particular interest in mounts or pictures, I get a lot more pleasure in seeing them swim away to fight another day. To each his own?"
14465,ccmtcanada,2006-12-20 13:28:00,7971,"blyght and I release almost everything we catch....whether it's a 12"" bullhead or a 32"" walleye.  The only one we've kept was a 15lb walleye that blyght tried to release for over a half and hour in vain.  She was hooked deeply and unfortunately was hooked in the gills.  Blood was everywhere.  We are making sure that her legacy continues....we're getting it mounted in the new year."
14490,Garyv,2006-12-20 14:10:00,547,We release most of what we catch so when it's decided to eat a few doesn't bother me a bit.
14539,caper,2006-12-20 16:03:00,210,I keep some for a meal now and again and nope don't feel bad about it..
14542,yellowboat,2006-12-20 16:10:00,211,MMMM Pickerel in fish crisp and fried in bacon grease  MMMM 
14556,urbanangler1990,2006-12-20 17:00:00,933,"interesting guys, good stuff..."
14567,lilkynan,2006-12-20 17:26:00,173,Catch and Keep and Eat - but you must eat ALL!!!
14575,dustink,2006-12-20 18:09:00,526,"Like most others, I only feel bad, when I have to keep a fish I wanted to release, or release I fish I wish I could keep because I know it won't make it.  That being said, most fishing I do around home is for pan fish and bass.  I don't keep any bass, but have no problem keeping pan fish.  They have very strong populations, strong reproduction, and they call them pan fish for a reason....they taste so good in the pan....especially with a nice steak:      When I'm up your alls way, we'll keep a couple fish each for the fish fries, but don't bring any home, and work hard to realease as many fish as possible....only keeping what we need for that night's feed.  I think it boils down to ""each his own"" as long as they are within the limits of the laws.  I don't think keeping a leagl limit makes you less of a ""sportsman"", but just makes you a ""sportsman"" with a different opinion on keeping fish then maybe another ""sportsman"" has...and there is nothing wrong with a difference in opinions, as long as everyone can remain civil, and all have the well-being of the sport they love at heart!    dk"
14586,Mike Pike,2006-12-20 18:45:00,1332,"DustinK, that is a great advertisement for 'Catch and Eat!'  Mmmmmmmmmmmm..."
14720,huntervasili,2006-12-21 02:11:00,1604,"I usually keep a couple in a season... Never limit out and very seldom if ever keep naturally reproducing trout... I Hunt and fish and because I know I eat all edible and usable parts I feel no remorse or sorrow... Its called the food chain and its alot healthier than any of the food you can buy now anyway... My two cents, Bill"
14790,Whopper,2006-12-21 11:46:00,2174,Dustin could you PLEASE pass me that plate!    Whopper
14795,dustink,2006-12-21 13:25:00,526,"LOL....Phil, when ever we get together next year for some fishing, that's a plate will have end the day with!!  dk"
14286,Rizzo,2006-12-20 00:20:00,4754,"Yes I do feel bad.  Its been a couple of years since I've kept a fish for personal consumption.  This summer I caught a real nice pickerel and figured I'd eat it.  Kept it in the live well for a couple of hours but my conscience got the best of me and I eventually released it!  It swam away strong...but if it hesitated I would have kept it.  I have no problem with people who do chose to keep fish, it just isn't my thing."
14295,tjsa,2006-12-20 00:42:00,1578,"I only have a sour taste in my mouth when intending to release a fish and am forced, or my buds are forced, to keep it, or release it, because it was deeply hooked, damaged in some way, that we know or suspect it will not survive, but have to follow the regulations regardless.  Happened this summer with a large 20 lb. + laker my bud caught, but somehow despite being jaw hooked, it was bleeding profusely. Something happened in the fight or the net job, who knows, but he had to keep it.  Also happened to me with a walleye over 18""(already had kept one over, and our regs. only allow one over 18"" per day) deep hooked, was bleeding, but not too badly, but still had to put it back. I had pinched the barb down as I had already kept 3 and the limit was 4, and we were fishing for my and my buds last fish. I landed a few more walleye all jaw hooked and released no problemo, bunch of small fish, was looking for one about 16"" to complete my limit, which I ultimately caught.  Also a few years back, I hooked a pike in the slot which was also bleeding quite a bit, but it was in the slot, so it had to go back, no choice.  Those events are the only times I feel guilty about keeping, or releasing a fish.  Fortunately, the above events are the only times in all the years it has not been our explicit choice to keep or release a fish.  I have kept deep hooked fish before, quite a few times, but they were always within my limit or slot size, and even though I may have released it given the choice for a more suitable sized fish for my liking if it was lip hooked, I kept it because I believed it would not have survived, so its not a big deal to me in those situations."
14302,Greencoachdog,2006-12-20 00:57:00,8163,"I, like most have said would only feel bad to have to keep a large mortally wounded fish... but that hasn't happened in a very long time. I pride myself on being a swift hook removal surgeon and I don't let fish ""swallow"" my bait.  I like to keep smaller Crappie and Catfish from cold water, nice pan sized fish. Some people say I'm crazy for some of the fish I throw back, I just look at them and smile.  Don't feel bad about keeping smaller fish, pollutants are cumulative and the bigger ones are less fit to eat... they also lay more eggs and spread more milt.  Enjoy your responsibly harvested fish, it's your right!  Glen"
