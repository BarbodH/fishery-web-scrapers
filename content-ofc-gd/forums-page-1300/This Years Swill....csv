Although I haven't attended a ""Take a kid fishing"" event, I remember that it seemed like a very worthwhile venture.  I think Rick had something to do with it. I've got some stuff I could donate and I'm sure many other members could find stuff at this ""Time of Giving"". What would they be looking for??"
