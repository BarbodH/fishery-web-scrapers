14207,wishn4fishn,2006-12-19 21:31:00,108,"I decided to take the future ex wife and dog to do some morning fishing.  Very slow/non existent morning bite.  Got a hit, tiny head shakes.... Great shaker for the pan.  I'm already thinking the recipe, and imaging the flavour and texture of the meat.  To my suprise it was a 9 or so pounder lying exhausted near the bank.  I feel like a kid that's been jipped the greatest toy present ever.  Worst fight, hands down.  I ask for the documentation assistance and by the second spunky run it broke off the ""garbage"" 6lb drennan fluro leader, right at the hook.  Beautiful coloration on the male disappear, as it digests the sweet flavour of freedom and a battle rightfully conquered.  Time goes on and desperation sets in.   I keep braking off the leader right at the knots on hooksets and snags.  I reload and first drift on a new setup, a smaller brown hen breaks the water and performs a freakshow.  MMMM fresh brown roe.......  ""Finally"" says Jason ""Dood, it's a brown!!!"" I exlaim with a sudden joy ""That's a rainbow"" says another angler ""MMMMkay, dood it's a brown"" I protest ""Hey man, that's a brown!!"" confirms the unkown dood ""  ""  Here's the dinner shot "

14459,wishn4fishn,2006-12-20 13:11:00,108,"LOL Paulus, I had a proper hold picture but the eye came out like the fish was dead.   Dead on center in the middle and glazed.  I'd get crucified if i posted it on ff.net.  Regards to the colour, it's just fresh lake run hen.  Pure Chrome."
