14367,Nemo,2006-12-20 03:23:00,727,What a great board. Answers for everything and they really work.  Congrats on the new sponsor.   So how do I get my wife to let me go on a week long Fly In Trip next year?
14370,Rich,2006-12-20 03:30:00,3927,Congrats!
14373,Rattletrap2,2006-12-20 03:42:00,1652,Way to go! I think Crazyhook might have something there with the Mann's idea! LOL
14388,douG,2006-12-20 04:16:00,2693,"Nemo, I have absolutely no idea how you buy a pass for your fly in trip.  Apparently, you should do something different than what I'm doing.  I think we should get together for a strategy meeting."
14404,Blake,2006-12-20 04:43:00,418,Congrats on the new sponsors.

14487,setomonkey,2006-12-20 14:09:00,872,"That's impressive, I remember you posted about that only a little while ago.  Glad it worked out, there are some sponsored tournament anglers and guides here who I'm sure would be willing to help out somebody who is just starting.  Mike"
14636,"Bob ""jigger""Mann",2006-12-20 21:57:00,8,Theres more. On my way home today I stopped to pick up some stuff for my wife at our pool place that just put our pool in this summer. The owner seen my new truck with all the sponsor decals. He asked about them. You will never guess what he said. How do I get on your truck. $400. for decal in back window plus $2000 grand per year with a 3 year deal. Befor I left he had given me a disk with what he want on decal and cheque for decal and he would have the othere cheque in the first of the year. Once again thanks for all the help you have given me. I will be fishing the BFL in Michigan. Last year I did it as a co-angler. Loved it going back as a pro in the states in 2007.  You guys are great. If I have any questions I now were to go.  Jigger  Bob Mann  Sorry no relations to Mann's bait. I have sent out portfolio to them.
