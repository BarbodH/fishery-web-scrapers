14137,JFR,2006-12-19 18:36:00,498,"Rick,  I think there is a problem with this site, or your computer.    I'm fine checking the threads and responding if necessary, BUT, whenever there is a post initiated by you or you respond to it.  When I open the thread, I get the very top banner of the OFC Community, then the site freezes up, I then have to re-boot to get out and return.  I posted this a couple of times, but it has gone to the great computer in the sky somewhere.  I even tried to PM you and I again freeze.  Will you please looking into this and make whatever corrections may be necessary.   Thank you,  John Ross"
14143,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 18:50:00,3382,Maybe I made that happen on purpose.. Actually I don't have anything in my posts that everyone else doesn't have. I'll try something that is a long shot..the apostrophe in my name may cause issues cause the system has to parse it into html otherwise it looks like it is part of a command line. Anyone with an apostrophe in their names knows of what I speak. If that isn't the case then I would think the only other issues would be Java. Pretty much everyone re-wrote their Java scripts for the newest version of Java (including the Google ads) as well as whatever scripts we use for the site. Try doing an upgrade to the newest version. http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp

14152,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 19:03:00,3382,"Uhh..I never thought of that. Hmmm... I think it is old Java on his part cause if it locks down after the header, the next to load is the Google and t is pretty much all Java scripting."
14157,Raf,2006-12-19 19:06:00,3495,I'll cut & paste and PM him that.

14229,JFR,2006-12-19 22:16:00,498,I think the download of the new Java scripts has helped.  I was able to get past Rick and to the end.   YEE HAW!  Thank you  JR
14248,aplumma,2006-12-19 22:46:00,6896,thanks Rick I downloaded the java and next thing I know my whites got whiter and the even my breath has that minty sparkily freshness that I have been missing lately.  Art
