Is there any good shore fishing in the GTA this time of year?  Are the pike in Toronto Harbour still on the bite?  Is Scugog frozen?  If not, is it worth giving it a go off the causeway this time of year?  Any other ideas?"

14363,BabyHerc,2006-12-20 03:06:00,285,Still some pike to be had downtown.
14499,setomonkey,2006-12-20 14:42:00,872,I'd think pike (see snag's latest report from the Islands) and trout in local tribs.  Mike
