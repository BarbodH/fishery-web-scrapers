13690,Terry,2006-12-18 17:32:00,14456,seems like an interesting  little unit but I can't see anywhere that it is or isn't waas enabled
13800,woodro,2006-12-19 00:01:00,168,no but ive heard many good things about the unit. Should help a lot while navigating to your favorite spots then helping you locate the underwater structures

Besides being able to plug destinations in - or simply find on the map and it tells you every turn ... tons of other info like lodging, gas, restaurants ... kinda neat, especially when you travel alone a lot like I do.  Pete"
14558,lilkynan,2006-12-20 17:05:00,173,"OK - so here is the scoop - this is a new one in the series and they missed something in the program. This unit is the only one of this series that supports both road and marine. So I got the Navtronics Easter Great lakes 901G that covers all of  Ontario, Erie, Quine, Trent, Rideau, Georgian and so on - lots of good lakes in Ontario also   But the chip is huge!!! - with all depth info, structure underwater, marinas, bouys etc. - so being so large, they were to program a Pull Down menu by location to show what body of water you wanted insteasd of loading all.  And there will not be a download fix until the end of January - good thing it is not boating season!!  Will keep you all posted  http://www.lowrance.com/automotive/Products/iWAY250C.asp"
