14921,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-21 22:37:00,2050,"Hey all,  Well I got my very first ""noodle rod / spinning reel"" combo (thanks to Fishnsled) and i'm hoping to make all you seasoned steelheaders proud next week while on holidays.  Looking to hook into my first ever!  I have a question reguarding the time of day to fish them.  I figure it's best to go after them at daybreak, but if it happnes to ""chill out"" next week, would be be a good idea to wait until the sun comes up and warms everything up a little bit? or do the bow's take off and hide during the afternoon?  Happy holidays, UF"
14940,wishn4fishn,2006-12-21 23:29:00,108,"There is no right ""schedule"".  Alot of it has to do with proper conditions due to weather, visibility, fish activity, aggression and so on.  Try to get out as much as u can.  I love being the first one there and waiting out the sunrise or using a lighted float.  Some days it's just off or slow.  Like with everything, you gotta put in the time and effort and you will be rewarded (eventually).  All the best and Good luck."
14941,FishFinder,2006-12-21 23:42:00,481,"IF the temperatures are below 0 dont bother with first light, because the river will be slushy and your line and guides will freeze like crazy. You can still catch fish but its alot harder to fish."
14946,canadian_copper,2006-12-22 00:02:00,925,"TOO MANY FACTORS GO INTO A QUESTION LIKE THAT!!! YA GOTTA LOOK AT AIR TEMP, WATER TEMP, WATER CONS ECT ECT!! WHEN ITS REAL COLD YA GET A FEW HUNGRY ONES AT FIRST LIGHT!!! THEN WHEN EVERYONE GOES HOME YA USUALLY START TO POUND THEM AFTER 11  !!!LOL  ITS JUST A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE WIFE SO YOU CAN STAY OUT ALL DAY  LOL"
14949,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-22 00:25:00,2050,"WISHIN' - Thanks, I think it's supposed to rain later this week so I figure I'll wait until the river JUST starts to clear up...like you say, sometimes they're just off but it's better than being in the house..... THanks for the good luck wishes....  FISHFINDER - yeah the main reason I was asking was because if it's cold i'd like to avoid the freezing of my eyelets and stuff...but if there was no point in going in the afternoon I was going to tough it out....thanks!  CC - I've got a 6 week old baby  girl at home and its my only week off for a while so getting out all day will be asking alot of the GF! haha I'll give a full report on the conditions even if I don't catch my first bow!!!  So this whole winter shore fishing thing is weird to me because I grew up in sudbury, not usually to many shore fishing opportunities mid winter up there. (although this year could be different).  I'm stolked to give it a go!  Good Fishing all!  UF"
14956,canadian_copper,2006-12-22 00:47:00,925,"just remember to check the regs so your not fishin in out of season waters!!! different for alot of creeks!!! good luck!!! hint for ya!!! try to get a very slow presentation in!!! cold water slows the metab down so they dont wanna chase it!!! roe , jig  or worm is best bet!!"
