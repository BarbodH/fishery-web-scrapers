14052,snag,2006-12-19 15:32:00,1932,"Hey Y'all.  Headed out to the Islands yesterday.  There was the possibility of other OFNers there too (BabyHerc and DSN)  Twas not to be.  I was the only fisherman on the islands. Matter of fact, the place was devoid of life. Love it.  I was hoping that the day would be as nice as Sunday but it turned out to be windy and cold.  I had some great bites and lost a few.  Here are some pics.....   They don't like it when you troll from the ferry.   Thought this Rocky racoon was dead but he was homeless struggling/squirming to hide his head from the sun. I think he was kicked out of the bed at night and was in the doghouse.   I have an extreemely tasteless caption for this but I promised Muskystudd that I would be good. (Insert your own caption here:                        )     And now the CATCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!  This one was a reaaaaaal fighter! And is for sale. Needs a little TLC.   Lost this one. Not hooked to well. Too bad it was a decent size.   Had some great follows at this spot, then lost a nice one and then finally was rewarded with this lil'snotty.   This one was totally unexpected. I cast into 5 FOW just for fun and this dude hits. Very aggressive fight.    That's it folks!!!!!!!!!  Thanks!"
14057,ccmtcanada,2006-12-19 15:39:00,7971,Awesome report snag!!  Great to see people getting out this late in the year.  That last pike was a nice size!  Trolling from the ferry??  They dont like that???  Jeez....it's not like your disrupting their business or anything!
14062,motv8tr,2006-12-19 15:47:00,2587,Nice to see people taking advantage of the weather...  Good stuff Sang...  when does Pike and Walleye season close?  Maureen
14064,ccmtcanada,2006-12-19 15:54:00,7971,Cant fish for walleye in Div 8 (Lake O) from First day of Mar until first Saturday in May.......I believe Pike is closed for April only...opening again the first Saturday in May.
14068,snag,2006-12-19 16:04:00,1932," That's right Cliff.  However, I don't fish catch and release if the weather will be below freezing. Not because I can't handle it, simply because the fish can't. Their eyes and gills freeze up in seconds. They will die.  So it'll be catch and clean soon on the ice (I hope)"
14101,urbanangler1990,2006-12-19 17:29:00,933,ohh very nice! maybe ill hit up the islands soon...

14228,highdrifter,2006-12-19 22:16:00,2534,KEWL!  Nicely done G.  Any plans on Wednesday?
14230,dsn,2006-12-19 22:16:00,1018,Sorry Snag I was camera shopping. Now that I have my camera I'm ready to roll again!!  dsn
14244,Rich Clemens,2006-12-19 22:42:00,3131,"It sure is great to get out for some action.  Nice size on that last one there, but it was fun."
14256,setomonkey,2006-12-19 22:55:00,872,"Always fun to see a report from you, snag...  A bit of a surprise to me to hear that there are still active pike around the Islands.  Mike"
14262,snag,2006-12-19 23:11:00,1932," Let's go.  You have a PM.     Good!  My camera is still a 2.1 mp!!!! See ya out there!!   Thanks,  I was cold and almost fell in the water on that last shot!   Thanks Mike,  I was suprised too. Even if I was skunked, it was nice to be there."
14275,007,2006-12-19 23:41:00,537,WTG Snag!  Good to see that those pike are still there.  That last one is a good size.  Have caught a few myself from that area this year but never that big - always little rockets. A nice reward for the long walk to and from the ferry!  Did the racoon make it into the hole?  Maybe I'll get out there this weekend for one last cast for this year.  Thanks for sharing. 007
14279,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-20 00:02:00,2050,"well everybody else pretty much covered it but hey, way to go dude!  Thanks for the eye candy (the pike).  cheers"
14289,mepps,2006-12-20 00:27:00,1301,I recognize those blurry spots!
14294,BabyHerc,2006-12-20 00:37:00,285,"As do I .  Sorry Snag, I'll do some gear shopping by this weekend.  I'll be ready to rock this weekend and the following week."
14357,Greencoachdog,2006-12-20 02:44:00,8163,"Excellent report, pics, and fish!!!... as always.... I still think yer a nuckin' fut."
14468,ccmtcanada,2006-12-20 13:35:00,7971,"I have to say, that if there was an award for most entertaining fishing reports of the year that that honour would go to you....hands down!!!  Hey...why isn't there an award for that???? haha.  I still laugh over that salmon post in October...still no phone call???"
