14371,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-20 03:35:00,0,"Well I treated myself to an early Christmas present this year.  My new toy for the winter (if the snow ever comes   ),  Specifically for ice fishing on Simcoe and hauling the hut out.  It's a 1996 Skidoo Grand Touring SE (670 CC). She's got electric start, reverse, thumb and handwarmers, full guages and only 4800 km's.  Now I just have to learn to use it.  ...but I will  Here she is.....          "
