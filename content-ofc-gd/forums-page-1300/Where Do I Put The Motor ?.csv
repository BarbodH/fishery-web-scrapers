Any idea of how I can mount a 9.9 to it?   http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p304/pa.../P1000549-1.jpg  http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p304/pa.../P1000559-1.jpg  http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p304/pa.../P1000558-1.jpg  Bottom Views   http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p304/pa...en/P1000552.jpg  http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p304/pa...en/P1000553.jpg  Entropy"
14603,Headhunter,2006-12-20 19:30:00,5703,"Here's what I would do! Cover up all but one of the holes in the floor. Attach a fan, sized to fit the hole, above the whole and in turn, attach a 9.9 motor to the fan. Now, get a good quality tarp, attach it to the circumferance of the hut, glue it down to be air tight. Start the 9.9 and you've got yerself a hover craft! Good for any ice/water/chunks your gonna run into!"
14604,Entropy,2006-12-20 19:35:00,747,Great idea !!!  Do you think this fan will work? lol  http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p304/pa...en/P1000565.jpg
14606,Headhunter,2006-12-20 19:51:00,5703,I might go with a little bigger blade!!LOL HH
14610,Entropy,2006-12-20 19:59:00,747,Alas I have found inspiration !!  http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p304/pa...len/rnyacht.jpg

14799,Entropy,2006-12-21 13:38:00,747,You know your right.... don't want her breaking up half way on plane.
