14718,brookieman,2006-12-21 01:57:00,68,The link from the OFC Online Tournament to the forums is a bad link.  Think it links to the old forum on ProBoards.
14719,Spiel,2006-12-21 01:58:00,9065,....You're quite likely correct. Rick will have to make the changes on that one. Thanks.

14726,ChrisK,2006-12-21 02:51:00,2772,Thanx for the heads up Rick
