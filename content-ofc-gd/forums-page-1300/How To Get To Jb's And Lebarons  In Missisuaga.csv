Go south on Kipling and just before you cross the 401 Ronson runs off on your right (west).  From there you can get back on the highway west and then go south on the 427 to dundas.  Go west on dundas from the 427 and LeB's is on your left a coupld KM west of the 427.  Its east of Dixie and I think there is an Arby's or something in front of it, but its been a couple years so that may have changed"
