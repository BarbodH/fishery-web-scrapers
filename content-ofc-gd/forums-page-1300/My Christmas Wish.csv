It has been awhile since I have been on the board, I have not had much time to myself due with the xmas season here, and most days I don't know whether I am coming or going right now. I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you....  I got a phone call Friday night from my mom and she annouced that my brother-in-law is now back home on his 2 week leave from Afghanistan! I called him the next day and he sounds really great! He was not supposed to come home until the 20th but he came home early to surprise my sister. So it seems that our Christmas wish came true, it is just too bad that he has to go back in the beginning of Jan but that is his job and it is something that we have to deal with.  Also, I got a phone call last night from my sister and she told me that she is in the early stages of labour! This is their first child which is not due until the 24th but at least he is now home to be there for the birth of their first one, we were hoping that the baby would wait to make his/her apperance until the daddy came home. So there is alot going on for us this Christmas, Now all I have to do is sit and wait for the great news...I couldn't have asked for better Christmas gifts, he is home safe and well with us and I will have a new niece or nephew to love and spoil."
14072,ccmtcanada,2006-12-19 16:10:00,7971,WOW!!!!  Congrats on both fronts!!!!  Made extra special that daddy can be home during the holidays and the birth of their first child.  Cant think of a better Christmas than that!!!!  Anyways...hopefully we catch up in person during the next few weeks...
