(tree is Mexico and the BVI are a little costly and hard to come by)  At first glance it is jsut like any other Christmas tree...    But upon closer inspection there are numerous fishing lures through out the tree      And of course, a Mepps spinner...     Everyone else have their tree or Festivus pole already?"

But what's that on the chair??? lol  Hey Mepss, you know you're a die hard fisherman when you use lures for your decorations...lol... Good on you and Gillian.  I don't have one, haven't for almost 10 yrs now.  Not much point , I rarely get any company, and between the dogs and cats, a tree wouldn't last long here  Maureen"
