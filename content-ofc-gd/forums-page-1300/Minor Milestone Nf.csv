14830,bpsbassman,2006-12-21 15:59:00,941,"Well, I went to give blood today and it turns out that its my 75th donation.  They make a big deal out of it and take a picture and all that stuff.  I always wear the ""Be nice to me I gave blood today"" sticker, 'cause it does initiate conversation about it back at work.  The fact is that only 2% of the population donates. I know a lot of people aren't able to give for various reasons, but believe me, if you are able to you should consider it.  Seriously, it's probably the most important thing you can do to give a little bit back to society. When my Mother-in-law was in the hospital, she shared a room for a few days with a lady who was in getting platelets and happened to be the same blood type as me.  She couldn't stop thanking me enough for donating.  It made a major impact on me. My only regret is those times I would fall off the wagon for a few years and not donate. Traditionally, they are short of blood at this time of year, so if you get a chance, take an hour out of your day and help save a life. I just hope there's some blood when I need it. I'll get off my soapbox now"
14831,urbanangler1990,2006-12-21 16:04:00,933,"great stuff, nice to hear!"
14832,dustink,2006-12-21 16:05:00,526,"Congrats Roger....that is quite an acomplishment, very worthwhile, and something to be proud of!  My work has the Red Cross in every 8 weeks or whatever the minimum time is between donations....and if I'm not traveling, I'm donating.  I would guess by the nature of most OFC'ers that there are lots of ""blood giving"" types of folks here!  Merry Christmas, dk"
14835,ccmtcanada,2006-12-21 16:18:00,7971,"When I was in grade 5, I tested positive for TB....turns out I didn't have it, never exhibited symptoms, but that there is a risk I could be a carrier.  I totally forgot about it and when I was 25, I went to give blood.  My office frequently hosts blood drives for the Red Cross.  They asked me the TB question, and I was excluded.  Because of that, I volunteered for the day...giving out cookies to people as they left....I figure it was the least I could do."
14837,Squid,2006-12-21 16:29:00,1656,I give blood every 3 months. It is the least I can do to support the troops overseas.
14839,Rich,2006-12-21 16:45:00,3927,"Congrats Roger, that is a very admirable thing for you to do. I used to give blood when I was in high school and to be honest just havent thought about it since then. You got me thinking I better start donating again."
14847,Smokey,2006-12-21 17:29:00,1278,Great work Roger. I'm sure there are many greatful people out that that you have help throughout the years. Keep it up.
14849,Bernie,2006-12-21 17:37:00,3190,Minor milestone???????? hardly!!! 75 excellent. Im sneaking up on 25 and thought that was doing ok..Keep up the good work.
14851,bpsbassman,2006-12-21 17:40:00,941,"Great to hear Dustin & Squid!  That was cool ccmt ..........would have been easy to just walk out.  Rich, that's what happens to me periodically.  Best thing to do is pick up the phone and call 1-888 2 Donate (1-888-236-6283).  Then you're comitted"
14855,Whopper,2006-12-21 18:19:00,2174,"Good on you Roger! 75 times is awesome!  I've done it a few times, this got me thinking to do more.  Well done!  Whopper"
14857,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-21 18:23:00,0,Good for you Roger
14860,fishindevil,2006-12-21 19:18:00,6254,"way to go roger,and hey any one of us might need it at some time right,you never know,and congrats on your 75th donation..."
14863,wishn4fishn,2006-12-21 19:24:00,108,"Jesus loves u even more now. That's great.  It's really unselfish and thoughtfull of you.  I guess u donated gallons of the stuff by now.  Are u a special blood type???  ""Blood it's in u to give"" I'll be less stingy with my supply in the future, it's people like you that save others.  Wat a nice gift."
14893,Blake,2006-12-21 21:08:00,418,"Very well done, Congrats on 75."
14897,fishergirl72,2006-12-21 21:16:00,455,WAY TO GO ROGER!
14905,Squid,2006-12-21 21:41:00,1656,Meant to also give thanks to Roger for giving his blood for the sake of others. WTG
14931,Peter Panfish,2006-12-21 23:00:00,46,"I think I'll donate some of the red stuff once I turn seventeen. I always thought it was a good idea to donate blood, because its kind of wasteful to always be topped up, because you just make more anyways. Not donating blood is like an underutilization of resources."
14948,Rich Clemens,2006-12-22 00:09:00,3131,"Same as Dustink here.  My employer has the Red Cross in every couple months and I'm in line to do my part.  As my wife and I work in the same building and department, we can both give."
