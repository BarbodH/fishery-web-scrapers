14113,robin,2006-12-19 17:46:00,46,Just a heads up for anyone who is looking for some boxing day fishing sales. Brian and Steve at J&B's are open from 10:30 till 5:00 and they are doing No Tax on all regular priced stuff and GST only on sale items....... Robin
14116,Smokey,2006-12-19 17:53:00,1278,Thanks for the heads up Robin. I'll be travelling right past on boxing day. Will have to stop in for a visit.  Mike
14119,Crazyhook,2006-12-19 17:59:00,1154,awesome!!!!! please tell them I will be there!
14123,Raf,2006-12-19 18:08:00,3495,Sweet. I'll try to make it down as well.  Crystal Ball tells me I have a JBs gift cert in my stocking.
14133,Rizzo,2006-12-19 18:21:00,4754,I think JB's is about the only thing I miss after moving away from Toronto a year and a half ago.  Will have to visit them at the spring fishing show where I will walk away with many more musky baits than I need.
14135,Eddyk,2006-12-19 18:25:00,195,Does that mean your Christmas present to me will be  a day late this year?
14263,setomonkey,2006-12-19 23:07:00,872,Thanks for the heads-up. I think LeB usually has a no tax sale on Boxing Day too...  Mike
14267,camillj,2006-12-19 23:13:00,1988,Crystal Balls ? ... that could make running a dangerous thing  better walk instead
14272,snag,2006-12-19 23:27:00,1932,Looks like it will be an OFC swill!
14406,Crazyhook,2006-12-20 04:45:00,1154,is it all week or just boxing day?
