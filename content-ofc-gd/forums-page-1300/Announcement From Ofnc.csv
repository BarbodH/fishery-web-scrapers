14169,Smokey,2006-12-19 19:48:00,1278,I appreciate all the hard work and effort the group puts into keeping things running so smooth here. It's my first stop when I log on and my last stop before shutting things down.  Glad to hear your going to keep things going and I'm looking forward to being part of it.  Mike
14184,setomonkey,2006-12-19 20:35:00,872,"I think it's easy to assume the work involved in running this board isn't too bad b/c everything usually so smoothly, but it's obvious from the posts here that a lot goes on ""behind the scene"" that most of us never hear about.  I really appreciate what OFC is about and I especially appreciate the work the mods & admin guys have put into it.  Three cheers for all of you.  Mike  p.s. But you put Roy in charge of the Old Milwaukee AND the money??? Geez..."
14264,TJQ,2006-12-19 23:07:00,7806,"""p.s. But you put Roy in charge of the Old Milwaukee AND the money??? Geez...""   Umm  nobody said we were smrt."

MERRY CHRISTMAS OFC  Kerry"

14305,daisy_girl58,2006-12-20 01:05:00,116,"To all of you who have made this site possible  The new format is exceptional, but the one thing that really pleases me, is this... You guys go above and beyond to help people, like the auction or just the simple concern of peoples hard times and sickness....even deaths or the families with soldiers serving...... Anyone who has a complaint or bad mouths this site, well here is what I say to them.... Exit stage left the drama is over!  Thanx from a very proud member.... And special thanx to all members for support for my son in the marines and my husband..... A kind hand, a special thought.....an unheard prayer is what makes friends!  Thank you!

14312,keram,2006-12-20 01:17:00,585,"Thank TJ and CO for this board  I agree 100% with everybody here and would like to add my 0.02$. I've joined this board about 3.5  years ago. After short time I've realized that it is not just fishing board, but something more. No question is unanswered. We are sharing laughs, sadness and tears sometimes. After being a member for sometime I’ve set-up my own rules for this board. 1. Being a member here is a privilege and it is not mandatory 2. My code of ethics is not necessarily everybody’s code of ethics 3. If you can help –DO IT, if not -SHUT UP there is at least 10 others who knows more about the subject 4. Respect other opinion  if you want yours to be respected  And for the “fishing part”  1. Respect the law and follow the rules 2. AND FOR GOD SAKE POST REPORTS AND PICTURES !!!!!!!!!"

14335,danc,2006-12-20 01:48:00,4677, We'll do it one of these days Moosebunk. Sounds like a plan to me..
14398,Rattletrap2,2006-12-20 04:35:00,1652,Thanks for all you do guys!  I thought about looking for a fishing club to join for many years....nothing could come close to this place!
14403,Crazyhook,2006-12-20 04:41:00,1154,"you all do a great job on this site. well done to everyone. Except Roy , he never pms me anymore"

14422,OhioFisherman,2006-12-20 09:39:00,6623,Ya what he said! Still the best site on the web! Dang I might have fixed my computer problem! LOL
14450,aplumma,2006-12-20 12:36:00,6896,As I have said in the past publicly and privately to all of the people that make this board function THANK YOU and if you need any thing feel free to PM me and I will help as I can.  Art
14451,JFR,2006-12-20 12:43:00,498,"THANK YOU to the selfless behind the scene peoples, I'm behind you all the way. I cannot imagine calling any other site ""home""  John"
13949,danc,2006-12-19 04:40:00,4677,"As a new moderator here, I would have never guessed what goes on behind the scenes. Sure, I've seen the odd post disappear in the past and such. But there's much more that goes on to keep this place running that I would have never dreamed of. Kudos to the mods of the past and I hope that I can carry on the legacy that is required to keep this place a decent and fun place to chat about fishing, and whatever, and most importantly, to meet new friends. OFC is a very special place. I'm proud to be here."
13951,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-19 04:45:00,2050," I know what you mean....I don't get some people.  They get some sort of kick out of it, or they have to much time on their hands..... we should get the boys here to crack their super geek hacker sites! haha  Good work guys - the numbers say it all!  UF"
13956,Carp,2006-12-19 05:11:00,1488,Terrific news for the OFC.  Having to deal with law suits....not so terrific.
13964,Greencoachdog,2006-12-19 10:02:00,8163,"I'd like to thank the Root and Core admins for a darn fine job well done!!! Y'all have made this board what it is today and should be very proud of yourselves! I've seen this board change and grow and it has all been for the better.  I'd also like to thank the good members of this board, for their time and contributions. The fishing reports are half of what this board is about and it takes alot of time and effort to post them and I thank everyone that has posted one. The ""How To"" questions and answers, humor, rants, and support (looking for and giving) posts are the other half of this board and adds a certain variety that also adds interest.  To me this board is a little more like a family than a community... quite dysfunctional at times... but a family none the less  ... and without the fine folks behind the admin. controls it would go to hell in a handbag quickly!  So a big THANK YOU to everybody and have a Happy and Safe Holidays!!!  Glen"
13967,misfish,2006-12-19 10:49:00,29133,"I feel shame,as I am part of the reason for one of those acts against this site.  I for one will keep my comments to myself,as it seems, a thicker skin is worth much   If theres shares to buy,Wyane can you buy some for me.LOL   Thanks to TJ for the call btw the other night, and the backing of all the members here with the numerous pm,s I recieved.   Happy holidays to all ,may you have a safe and maybe a white christmas."
13971,steve_paul,2006-12-19 11:42:00,658,Thanks Rick for the update and for providing this board for us to enjoy.
13995,BITEME,2006-12-19 13:20:00,1969,unfortunatley im  with misfish and I will keep my vitrol to myself sorry if I have caused you grief in the past I  have never meant harm just get a little aggitated at times I promise i'll be a good boy in the new year and from now on  By the way this site the people on it and the individuals that run it KICK A$$  THANKS
14036,Beans,2006-12-19 14:55:00,3339,Ya but...What have you done for us today???  Just Kidding...you guys in the background are doing a super job with this site...  You and all the members have provided this old fart with many grand and glorious moments over the past 5 years and also some bad and sad moments also...but that is no different than our immediate family...and that's all part of life...
14037,TJQ,2006-12-19 14:58:00,7806,"Thanks for the support guys, this new setup is going to allow for better moderation, and since the switch to the new setup we've been getting a few more advertisers looking in as well.  I'm so happy that all the mods are willing to step up to the plate for me.   Yes our family is a bit dysfunctional at times.. but lol.. what family isn't... I don't think there is such a thing as a functional family anyway (mines fine but they have me to contend with...)  I liked DanC's post about what an eye opener it is to see what goes on around here while we attempt to please everyone.. lol... One of the things that makes this a difficult job for me is that I hate having anyone mad at me.. always have... so I think that over the years I have perhaps let some members stay on too long cause I tried to please them, when in fact most of them looked at this as a vuneralbility.  The other nite (for the countless time) the wife and I sat down and discussed once again what was the point to doing all this... over the years I have come to the brink of closing the board down countless times, it has cause me many many sleepless nights and has ruined many (and I'm not kidding - many a family vacation)  I'm too thinned skinned sometimes, I know.  Very recently it was Jadens 10th birthday... and I spent most of the day on here trying to keep an eye on what was going on and pming people to try and settle issues down, when I should have been with my daughter.   I'm not loooking for sympathy here, but alot of users don't really appreciate what it takes to keep this place going even close to smoothly.  It would be one thing if we were rolling in the cash here, but, and I'm sure any other messageboard owner will tell you its a labour of love and not profit.  Trouble makers will always come and go around here, that's a fact that we can't get away from.  Fortunalty with this new setup, its not all on me anymore and LOL.. I have some partners that are gonna allow me to get on with the fun stuff.  Thanks to them and thanks to all board members."
14042,dustink,2006-12-19 15:10:00,526,"Great work as usual guys!!  Thanks to all you ADMIN's who deal with all the CRAP, so the rest of us can have a great place to share, laugh (at & with), and cry with others!  OFC is truly something unique, and I'm not sure what I'd do if it went away!!  Yikes...I may have to actually work during the day!!  dk"

14144,Bly,2006-12-19 18:52:00,1556,"I have been sitting at my desk today trying to compose a post to say THANK YOU and to let all those involved with running this wonderful site how much I appreciate their hard work and how it would truely break my heart if anything were to happen to it.  I am finding it just about impossible without writing a novel.  So, in an effort to be brief but in no way minimize the meaning....  This board/community has made me sit in awe/amazement/wonder, made me laugh and a few times, almost cry. I have been ""online"" a long time,longer than I have known my husband and over the years I have joined and left many message boards. This is the ONLY website/message board that I have ever frequented that I would actually pay a membership fee to be part of.  If there is ever a way that I can help out, Please,let me know!  blyght"
