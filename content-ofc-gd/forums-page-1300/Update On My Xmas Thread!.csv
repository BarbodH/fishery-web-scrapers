My sister had her new daughter at 5:00 this evening! She weighed in at 5 lbs 11 oz and is very healthy! Her name is Dianna. Well now I can relax and count all the blessings that I have. I could have not asked for a better Christmas gift!  I would like to take the time to thank everyone here for their kind words and incredible support that you have shown me and my family. Thank you very much, you guys are the BEST!"
