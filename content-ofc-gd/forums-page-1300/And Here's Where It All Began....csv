15005,John Bacon,2006-12-22 03:35:00,3277,I still have that snap set lure listed in the contest section     I caught quite a few fish with it this past summer.  Does anybody know if they are still made.  I don't think that I ever saw one in a store.

13891,tomO,2006-12-19 02:49:00,363,Thats when I started following things here. Under a different name though.
13894,Bernie,2006-12-19 02:52:00,3190,You guys have been doing this since 97? wow.I have lots to catch up on!
13899,tjsa,2006-12-19 03:03:00,1578,"And someone posted this pic, I think Roy, first ever GTG at Lakair, not necessarily a planned event at that time, but a great picture nontheless, some of the members are still here, some are not.    Darn, I wish I was one of those people in the picture. I know quite a few in that picture, but have never, ever, met any of them."
13901,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 03:05:00,3382,Wow..was Spiel ever tall back then...
13905,tjsa,2006-12-19 03:10:00,1578,"Everybody else is kneeling down Rick, lol.   And, do you recognize TJQ in that pic, he is there."
13912,Joey,2006-12-19 03:16:00,9122,"TJ looks like a cop, or a Burt Reynolds wannabe  Joey"
13917,pigeonfisher,2006-12-19 03:23:00,696,"commonly referred to as the Crayola Crew.  Nice!  I was there for round 2...it surely wasn't round one, but we had fun!  Good luck to those this year on round 5?"
13919,Roy,2006-12-19 03:25:00,13728,"Yes....that was a good weekend. Top row left to right we have: Marty, AlanJ, GaryV, Muskiestudd,one of Mikeo's sons, then the holy trinity of Kronik, CoolB and (help me out) then Spiel, TJ, Tony (Marty's brother) and Cory Front row, left to right: Garry 2R's,Canadave,MikeO, another of MikeO's little ones, the Dwarf and Kevin. That was the very first and I still remember the great time we had."
13924,Bernie,2006-12-19 03:31:00,3190,How often do these occasions happen? And where?
13925,tjsa,2006-12-19 03:32:00,1578,"OH, thats Canadave, finally got a face to the legend, lol.  And this is circa??????????????................Roy???????????????/"
13927,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 03:34:00,3382,About an hour and a half from your place at Lakair Nippissing. Hey my mom lives in Powassan!
13929,Bernie,2006-12-19 03:41:00,3190,Hey thats cool Rick. Where in Powassan? I know most people in town.......So maybe I can boat over and join the fun next time? My cottage is on the other end in the South Bay.
13978,motv8tr,2006-12-19 12:32:00,2587,"Cool, you've come a long way that's for sure....but for all the changes that have taken place over the years, there's one thing that has stayed constant here...  All the great members...  Maureen"
14023,Garyv,2006-12-19 14:21:00,547,"The weather for the first G2G was to say the least WET WET WET, everyone had a good time ( some more than others ) and it has continued from there.  As mentioned in Roy's post I was at the first one probably due to me persueing the idea with TJ.  Didn't go again until 2006 and all I can say was it has got bigger and better.  When you can get that many people together from all walks of life and geographical areas and they get along for 3 or more days and just enjoy each others company it's simple amazing.  Hope to be there in 2007."
14024,ecmilley,2006-12-19 14:21:00,2163,i remember that board was on dial up with a 486 dx2 got the link fron the what's bitin board if i remeber correctly
14041,TJQ,2006-12-19 15:10:00,7806,"Yes... when i was on the whats biting board, I used to announce my newsletter once a month.   I still have a copy of the board that we started in 2001 , the one before proboards...."
14129,Hooked,2006-12-19 18:17:00,891,"Tried it, I keep getting a message that page isn't there, then a link to our old board is listed.  That only went back to 05 too.  I must be missing something here."
14150,bigfish1965,2006-12-19 18:58:00,3382,"You gotta fuzz around and find links before one works. Not all the links come back to an archive,,,"
14171,setomonkey,2006-12-19 19:54:00,872," That was the board run through Zoology at UofT, right? That's the first board I ""joined"" when I started fishing in 1999, heard about OFC afterwards and then moved over. That board went downhill shortly after if I remember correctly...  Mike"
14177,Handlebarz,2006-12-19 20:13:00,3790,found these there and others but they were two small to see who they are I think most know the first guy but how many know the second?    
14182,Whopper,2006-12-19 20:26:00,2174,"Pic of the first g2g is awesome!  With just a few people there at least Roy didn't have a problem with finding a place to sleep....as if he still does  GaryV I was and still am simply amazed at the experience of a Lakair g2g, I sure hope to return  Whopper"
14191,fishindevil,2006-12-19 21:06:00,6254,"yes i was on the whats bitin board to ,and remember the OFC link,i liked that board when it first started then it got real stupid all the fighting and lies and bad people ,thats when i stopped being a member ,then OFC came along and now   theres no other equal...cheers"
