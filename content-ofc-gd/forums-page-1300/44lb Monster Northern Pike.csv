14735,tjsa,2006-12-21 03:19:00,1578,"Uh, oh, here we go again, lol.  That pike is not from Rainy Lake, that pic has been circulating through the internet for over a year. It is from a Danish site I believe. Have a copy of it from over a year ago."
14736,bigfish1965,2006-12-21 03:20:00,3382,The last one is not from Rainy Lake but from Europe....  Edit: Thom beat me to it!

14796,fishindevil,2006-12-21 13:31:00,6254,"Well i didnt know that the fish was not from here,it makes me wonder where my boss got the pic as he is not a fisherman at all he just told me he sent me an e-mail about a huge pike,so you guys are saying its been around for over a year,and caught in holland or euorope somewhere..anyway whatever,its still a huge,monster pike     cheers"
14819,Roy,2006-12-21 14:26:00,13728,"It sure is big fishindevil, certainly the biggest I've ever seen."
14823,setomonkey,2006-12-21 14:42:00,872,"fishindevil,  Don't worry about it, it's kind of interesting how these kinds of hoax emails keep circulating. What I don't get is why somebody would enjoy passing bogus info along...  Big pike no matter where it was caught.  Mike"
