12866,Bernie,2006-12-16 05:53:00,3190,"In some parts of the Province, especially areas of mostly German decent, we commonly call them Block heaters."
12990,JenTavolacci,2006-12-16 21:55:00,68,fitting!
14212,Pete Maina,2006-12-19 21:40:00,213,"Which elf  Thorpe, you're looking good in that outfit - and obviously a better dancer than I.  (Man, I hate tights. Why would anyone want to wear something like that ... these days it seems mandatory for bicycling too; a sad deal ... when it moves on to motorcycles and fishing attire, we'll know the end is near.)"
14595,swahrer,2006-12-20 18:58:00,28,"I prefer... ""Hoser Hat"" Eh!  "

9051,aplumma,2006-12-06 20:21:00,6896,We called it a Watch Cap in the Military and their is even a special way to store it . You lay it flat on its side and then roll it from the top to the open edge. Then when you get to the bottom you flip oneside of the band over it length wise and you should have a hat that will stay rolled up till you need it. Sigh.... that about 200 brain cells wasted on remembering that knowledge from 1980. Its a shame that I cant pick and chose what I forget.   Art
9066,Joey,2006-12-06 20:47:00,9122,Its funny how the mind work eh Art.  But how to you get the propeller to fold up  Joey

But if you are looking for one of those beanies with a twirly thing -- we don't have 'em.   -Jen

9149,Carp,2006-12-07 00:12:00,1488,"That's a cold weather, heat loss prevention, skull warming device.  We also call 'em touques, hats, or bad hair day quick fixes."
9154,pameladallaire,2006-12-07 00:17:00,470,"I just bought two, and the label said ""Toque"".  It is the Timminns traditional hat in winter.  Unless you are a die hard cap fan and freeze your ears.   Toques are always a knitted or fleece fabric.  Pam"
9164,wuchikubo,2006-12-07 00:29:00,1114,"Toque, as many have already said.  LOL Terry!  I needed that before getting off work today!  Now Pete, you'll know better the next time someone's gonna take your pic!  Thanks again for the chuckle."

9310,Pete Maina,2006-12-07 03:02:00,213,"Good lord ... well, I have to admit the beanie was hilarious. The Santa hat is (amazing to me how the heck you do it), well ... maybe I need to eat some more.  Hey Thorpe ... you get to the floor yet? It ain't far ..."
9315,ccmtcanada,2006-12-07 03:07:00,7971,"See what happens when you ask a ""simple"" question when ppl are not doing much fishing????"

8770,JenTavolacci,2006-12-06 03:16:00,68,"Hi everyone! So we have some new products and I have a question that the Canadians should be able to help me with....I have attached a photo of Pete wearing what we call a ""beanie"". To my question... a couple of years ago I was at a trade show and met some people from Canada and they did not call this a ""beanie"", they called it something else that for the life of me I cannot remember. I had never heard the word before. Could someone tell me what these hats/caps/beanie things are called in Canada? I would like to add it to the product description....plus I am not so sure I like the name ""beanie"" for them.  Thanks!!!! -Jen  Oh yeah..... Marc Thorpe - no comments on what the arrow is pointing to!!!! Ah....forget it - go for it!  "
8774,ecmilley,2006-12-06 03:17:00,2163,i always called them a toque
8776,Roy,2006-12-06 03:19:00,13728,"It's called a ""Touque"", Jen  Milley is right of course  but I'm bilingual.  The correct English spelling is ""toque"" while the correct French spelling is ""tuque""."
8778,Bob,2006-12-06 03:20:00,370,Watch cap or touque but a touque usually has a pompom on top.
8780,JenTavolacci,2006-12-06 03:22:00,68,"AHHHH....and that would be why I did not remember it!!!! That seems to be it! I looked it up:  Toque: soft hat with a narrow brim worn especially in the 16th century, from Old Spanish toca headdress  1 : a woman's small hat without a brim made in any of various soft close-fitting shapes 2 : TUQUE 3 : a tall brimless hat worn by a chef -- called also toque blanche   THANKS!!!!!!"
8782,Roy,2006-12-06 03:25:00,13728,"Jen, I hope you realize that that pic of Pete will bring joy to the hearts of many accomplished Photoshop wizards around here. Personally, I can't wait.  Thank you."
8783,JenTavolacci,2006-12-06 03:28:00,68,"Yeah, we figured that, well...... as long as its bringing joy."
8805,bigfish1965,2006-12-06 05:16:00,3382,
8807,Joey,2006-12-06 05:22:00,9122,"And Jen, it's pronounced two-ck, not toku or talku, ha ha ha! EH!  Joey"
8812,sturgman,2006-12-06 05:50:00,249," Its a must for all Canadians who need to venture outside to shift our Igloo panels in high winds!!  At first i thought you were referring to a skull cap, but yup that right there is a toque"
8815,jediangler,2006-12-06 06:10:00,1923,"Nobody pulls it off like Pacino.  If it's all black, it's a Serpico hat."
8819,GbayGiant,2006-12-06 06:23:00,1780,No offence to Pete but everytime I see a pic of him it reminds me of the Crocodile hunter (RIP)   and they both seem like great guys and love toothy critters.
8824,JenTavolacci,2006-12-06 07:05:00,68,"The one Pete is wearing is a knit cap....it may be a Toque but maybe not, its not a skull cap though. We do have others at petemaina.com that I think for sure are Toques. Is that the plural? I tried to find out so I could put it on the site but Miriam Webster didn't give a plural for it. The others on the site are fleece....here is a photo:    Crocodile Hunter?? Funny!  -Jen"
8836,lew,2006-12-06 11:51:00,12767,"Jen, have a look at the pic in my signature, even dogs wear touques up here"

8847,douG,2006-12-06 12:58:00,2693,"If we called em a knit stocking cold weather beanie hat, our heads would be froze before we got out the house.  Toque."
8853,Marc Thorpe,2006-12-06 13:06:00,621,"Pete I""d like you to do little excesise  1) stand in front of a mirror 2) place Toque on your head 3) place both arms along side each side of you 4) Jump up and down  Make sure your ears are sticking out  You can call me if you like to yell insults  Dude thanks for the laugh,I aint worried about Verasce calling you"
8872,Fang,2006-12-06 14:00:00,1330,You know it's very hard to tell Pete and Lew apart when they're wearing tooks (proper northern ontario spelling).  We also call em skull caps and skidoo caps
8881,JenTavolacci,2006-12-06 14:18:00,68,"whatever happened to the old reliable word...""hat"".....hats, beanies, skull caps, toque, skidoo caps, watch cap......aaarrrggggg!!!!"

8976,Pete Maina,2006-12-06 17:40:00,213,"Oh man ... this is brutal. I've got spinners on my head-bone now ... knew never shoulda let her snap that photo.  Thorpe, put your Toque on, grasp firmly on both sides - and yank 'till you're touching your toes  Oh, and make certain for Dominique to take a photo"
8988,Marc Thorpe,2006-12-06 18:14:00,621,Terry I love the photo Fits his personality  He's quite the twirler
8992,eggshen,2006-12-06 18:24:00,5,hahaha a beanie?  Isn't that what little kids wear in comic book strips?  they also have a propeller that can spin on top.
