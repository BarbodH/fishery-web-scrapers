13236,Crazyhook,2006-12-17 16:59:00,1154,going to be in Toronto where should I shop?  Bass Pro / Jbs??
13244,mepps,2006-12-17 17:08:00,1301,"You should shop online, unless of course you like long line ups!!"
13248,danc,2006-12-17 17:14:00,4677,"I don't care if they're giving stuff away for free. I'm not fighting the crowds and waiting in line ups. You know, it's not really the line ups that bother me. It's the people in them that I despise!!"
13252,brickNblock,2006-12-17 17:26:00,598,"I dont shop. My wife has always done all of our shopping.... Christmas shopping starts Jan1...and lasts all year. Good thing about that Ive found is that if one of our kids or another relative or friend drops by and its their birthday and we've forgot....Charmaine just goes into her x-mas trunk and pulls out a gift. I dont have the patience for fishing shoulder to shoulder on the river side steelheading....not a chance I could take the line ups at any store. Thank the good lord for great wives. Great Fishing Stuff on boxing day sales........ I'd go the BPS website and pull up one of their special sale ads......OR, get in touch with Roger or Jackie (OFC'rs on the board who work at BPS) Sorry Crazyhook I couldnt help much...wasnt and are not trying to be a wise guy...just trying to catcth up to Joey's post count........."
13265,dheitzner,2006-12-17 17:56:00,314,"i will certainly, for sure, without a doubt, be hitting lebarons for their no tax sale.  great deals every year."
13272,irishfield,2006-12-17 18:11:00,26272,BPS is open for sure...but I'd be calling JB's to see..  I'm like Dan though...Boxing Day I'm not leaving the house..unless we're splittin wood.
13336,Crazyhook,2006-12-17 22:18:00,1154,I will give it a go... keeps me away from the inlaws...  need a few baits at JB's and a new fly rod combo
13338,irishfield,2006-12-17 22:27:00,26272,Call Brian to see if he's gonna be open Jamie 416-614-7222
13345,keram,2006-12-17 22:37:00,585,"Since I remember I've never tried to ""waste""  1 minute shopping on Boxing Day and hopefully I will never do. I just prefer to spend this day with my wife and kids, but definitely not in the shopping mall"
13376,Crazyhook,2006-12-17 23:54:00,1154,irishfield.. thanks man! I will giver him a shout and see if he can put aside the half dozen baits I am looking for  PS if I am saving money I am ok to spend money - love my wife
13377,DanTheMan,2006-12-17 23:57:00,257,No where!!  I dont beleive in Boxing day shopping.I think we should go back to the old days where ALL retaillers are close for 2 days solid in the whole year.Atleast that would give the small corner stores  a chance to make a bit of money
13381,irishfield,2006-12-18 00:00:00,26272,I hear yah Dan...I can remember well that you could travel no further than the tank of gas in the car at Christmas 'cause NOBODY was open.  But in Jamie's case...I think he has a legit reason to be out shopping... inlaws or shopping for new fishing gear...I know what I'd be doing! LOL
13394,Crazyhook,2006-12-18 00:47:00,1154,INlaws vs shopping with a few hundred bucks worth of gift certificates  PS my inlaws are nuts!!!!!!!!!!
14506,setomonkey,2006-12-20 15:04:00,872,"Then you're decision is clear, right?  From other threads, looks like BPS, LeB, and JB's will all be open for boxing day with no-tax sales.  You could spend the whole day hitting all three...  Mike"
14523,bpsbassman,2006-12-20 15:42:00,941,I know in the past BPS has had outstanding Boxing Day specials if you can stand the crowds. Flyer should be up on their website beforehand.
14563,ccmtcanada,2006-12-20 17:10:00,7971,"One of the only times I went out on Boxing Day was for my oldest daughter.  We bought her what she wanted that year....a Playstation 2.  She was so excited to unwrap it....it even came with a game so she could get started right away.  We hooked it up and it didn't work.  She was a trooper, but I could tell she was disappointed and it almost killed me seeing that.  I PROMISED her that first thing boxing day, I'd be up and back to the store to get a new one...if they even had one.  I was in front of the store 1/2 hour before it opened....got in and returned home with a new working unit."
14588,Joey,2006-12-20 18:47:00,9122,"Just an FYI, I got my boxing day BPS flyer in the mail today.  A couple of good prices on some things, about regular prices on others.  Joey"
14675,moosehead,2006-12-20 23:54:00,90,would anyone have a link to veiw the boxing day flyers online?
14758,nautifish,2006-12-21 04:00:00,1416,Really Joey?  I was just they're monday night past after dropping my eldest boy off at the airport. I was told they were going to have a big sale on alot of items at the customer service desk. Now you just said only a few discounted items.  I would like to know before hand. My plan was to take another trip up they're on boxing day morning 1st thing. But if they're are not alot of items on sale it would hardley be worth the trip for me. Dern and i was really hoping somethin i had seen on monday may be even cheaper on boxing day....lol  Xmas sucks....lol
14775,Carp,2006-12-21 05:21:00,1488,"I usually don't join the crowds, but if I really need something and it's a great deal............"
14780,Norpiker,2006-12-21 06:39:00,21,lebarons is great on boxing day especially if you're looking to get a big ticket item or 3.  Cheers
