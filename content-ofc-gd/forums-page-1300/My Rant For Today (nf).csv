14504,keram,2006-12-20 14:55:00,585,"I have Pontiac Grand AM (96, V6, 3.1L). It has developed small leak in fuel tank. The only reason why I still keep it is that an engine and transmission work like new (200000+ K) Almost everything else (not related to safety) is broken. Why I do not try to fix it? This is the reason. Power window on passenger side (est. 370.00 parts + 200.00 labour + tax) not in my life time -now is always closed ( BTW on driver side it's started acting the same way - just the matter of time) A/C clutch ( est. whole compressor 700.00, clutch only 600.00   , + 250.00 labour + tax) bought clutch from scrap yard for 30.00 Windshield wiper switch (est 260.00 parts +180.00 labour + tax), not fixed, but only I know how to turn it off Daytime running lights module (est 310.00 parts + 150 labour + tax) One fog light (est 130.00 parts + 120.00 labour + tax) Last month I've put new tires and exhaust (approx 1000.00).  All estimates are from the dealer the car was purchased from. Now going back to fuel tank, first thing in the morning I've went to a dealer to have some idea how much it can be They make my day, all other customer were looked at me like at an idiot ( I could not stop laughing) The estimate for new GM fuel tank was 1300.00 part (the dot is in right spot - checked it twice) + 220.00 labour + tax)  The guy in parts department was laughing with me, and he's suggested two places where my problem can be solved for more reasonable price  I'm not surprised that GM is in deeeeep  :   , looks like will go only deeper. I'm leaving in few minute to find out what is the future of my Pontiac Possibility exist that the las trip will be to scrap yard ( I hope that they will pay me enough for taxi to Hundai or KIA dealer GM won't get one more cent from me"
14507,Gerritt,2006-12-20 15:05:00,6129,Stick a huge picture of a Lemon on both sides and drive it around town!! even park it out front of the dealership (just not on their lot)  1300.00 for a tank??? OUCH!!!  Gerritt.
14508,douG,2006-12-20 15:08:00,2693,"That's just awful.  I've bought my last GM, too.  Go get yourself a four year old Camry and be done with it."
14511,motv8tr,2006-12-20 15:15:00,2587,"Forget the dealer, find a good mechanic, you'll be surprised how much you can save that way...  Maureen"
14512,bigfish1965,2006-12-20 15:15:00,3382,"I got a few of those with my old Oldsmobile Royale.  In the center arm rest, there's a little lever to open it. A little 2 inch plastic thing. Mine broke off.I went into the dealership. They don't sell the little plastic thing...only the whole armrest. Price... $1,250..I said..I don't want the whole seat, just the armrest. I said had I known that 15% of the value of the car was tied up in the arm rest, I would have taken better care of it. I little crazy glue and some McGyvering and it was good as new. So then I can hear the wheel bearing in the front right starting to growl. I take it in. They call me back.. When they removed the hub, thebearing was actually shattered and fell onto the ground...nedds to be replaced. The left side is likely about the same and should be done. Okay..go ahead, I say. No one says anything about price, so I don't think much about it. A few hours later, theycall...car is done..bill is $1300. What?? Does everything cose 1200-1300 on a GM? The service rep couldn't believe that was the cost so he rechecked everything. They felt so bad they knocked $100 bucks off the price, but that was the day I traded in the car. Now I drive Chrysler and use aftermarket parts...or just trade it in when something really bad happens."
14516,Raf,2006-12-20 15:20:00,3495,"that's the cost of dealer parts these days.  aftermarket is certainly cheaper.  doing as much work as you can yourself helps too.  some of those labour quotes are outrageous.  150 for a DRL module? 120 for a foglight?  the pwr steering pump on my cherokee died.  $110 @ carquest, a couple of hours to drink beer and turn some wrenches and I'm back on the road.  also, resisting the urge to purchase cars decked out with creature comforts helps when things invevitably start breaking down.  my truck has manual windows."
14520,Garyv,2006-12-20 15:31:00,547,"When I had my GMC diesel van I couldn't find anyone local, including the dealer, that knew much about working on them so I purchased a few manuals and did everything myself with the exception of rebuilding the injector pump.  The same with most vehicles we have owned.  Dealers no matter what brand you purchase have become very expensive.  If your not mechanically inclined then find yourself a good local shop that knows what there doing and charges fair ( to them and you ) prices.  Find a local wrecker and try using used parts...works for me!  As a side note for 3 years I worked as an agent for a company that had over 30 dealerships in the Michigan area and a couple in Florida. My job was to call service, parts, and sales areas of the dealerships they owned and critique their employees.  It always amazed me ( and I'll use Saturn for an example ) that if you wanted the same work done,  say something like a brake inspection, the cost would vary by location with the dealer in the lower income areas being up to $75 cheaper than in a more affluent area.  Just think what a complete brake job price difference would have been!"
14532,caper,2006-12-20 15:55:00,210,  Mo's got it right there. I wouldn't ever go to the dealer for any work that's not under warranty. Find yourself a good back yard mechanic and you'll save a bundle
14540,keram,2006-12-20 16:07:00,585,"O.K. I'm back. It looks that I will be driving my Pontiac little bit longer ( just wander what next  ). My fuel tank is splitting in half and has to be replaced. It will be ready about 2:00 PM. Total cost  320.00 parts and labour + tax. Bare in mind that this shop was suggested by GM dealer service advisor  I would like to hear from GM justification for the price of fuel tank ( 1300.00 $ ). Well I'm ""grounded""  anyway ( no car) so I will make few phone calls to GM headquarters. I will keep you posted"
14545,Raf,2006-12-20 16:16:00,3495,There ya go.  never go to dealer unless it's warranty work.
14547,Disspatcher,2006-12-20 16:30:00,73,"Thats why we refer to them as the ""STEALERSHIP"""
14549,Randy,2006-12-20 16:36:00,115, I had a problem with a Voyager tranny once and the dealer quoted me a cost that was well above Mr. Transmission. In fact the dealer's service advisor sent me to Mr. transmission.  I was told the dealer quotes these high prices because they really don't want to fix it - probably not enough profit. So you go aftermarket and get a more reasonable price.
14550,keram,2006-12-20 16:51:00,585,"For last half an hour I've tried to  find the way to contact GM and ask 1 simple question: Why fuel tank for my car costs 1300.00 $. Maybe I've missed something but I could not find any way to ask this question over internet. If somebody can give me a clue it will be great. In mean time, if I won't be able to find this info today, I will visit GM HQ tomorrow ( I live in Oshawa  ) I will keep you posted"
14551,Mike Pike,2006-12-20 16:51:00,1332,"Unless it's warranty work( which it won't be with a vehicle the age of yours ), NEVER get it seviced at the dealership!  Local garages will always be waaaaaaaaay cheaper.  Heck, even the GM Service Advisor told ya to go to a garage!  Goodluck with it and may you need no more repairs for a long time!"
14559,holdfast,2006-12-20 17:05:00,1813,"Get your Parts from a Scrap Yard.  Buy a Haynes Book from Canadian Tire with the Model of your Car.  Buy a Case of Beer for your friend the Mechanical do-it yourselfer if things are too complicated for your self.  And plse dont sell the car to another dealer where he will rip someone that is unsuspecting.  If you Buy another car, do your homework buy reading Consumers Report or CAA Auto Opinion.  Good second hand Cars are Hyundai, Escort, otherwise pay more for Jap, the cheaper being Mazda"
14777,sirfish,2006-12-21 05:55:00,175,"Suck it up keram, it is the same at any dealership no matter what brand of car you buy. If you think the big three automakers are expensive at the dealership end then you go right ahead and buy a foreign made car and I will do the laughing while your crying about a huge parts bill, never mind the cost of the labour. Go to your local reputable scrap yard for your window motors ,usually can be got for about $50 piece and installed by yourself (no manual required) in about an hour.  If you have a question for GM then get ahold of your dealership and ask for the number of the area cutsomer service rep. or have him call you. My dad did this on my advice when his head gasket blew and he had it repaired at a local garage for a mere $900 ,half the cost of the dealer !!.he took the bill to a meeting set up with the rep and After a talk with the rep and some inside info on the inferior head gaskets they covered the cost of the repair.  Question: why is it you see lots of older and vintage north american cars on the road but you don't see any older foreign made cars? Answer: because there are none, you can't find parts to fix them cause noone makes them and if you do they cost an arm and a leg.......JMO"
14779,carll2,2006-12-21 06:13:00,443,"you just have to shop around example: my dads ford 150 last week needed a bearing change. ford quoted over 450$ my dad says screw that and goes to another mechanic in the area that has a good reputation same job same parts and same quality he was quoted 250$ , just need to do your homework"
14782,SBCregal,2006-12-21 09:37:00,688,"I have an older gm built car, a 87 regal and do most of my work myself, parts are DIRT cheap for it, I replaced all 4 shocks and springs, the entire brake system (master, booster, all lines and hoses) everything including wheel bearings and spent maybe 500 bucks in parts  :)  I love the old stuff"

14792,DanTheMan,2006-12-21 12:41:00,257," Ditto  I have 91 Delta 88 and I love it.Parts are cheap and working on them is easy.And I have my spare car 88 Plymouth Sundance.(well,thats a really cheap car, but its a good emergency car   )  And I have my 2005 Pontiac Montana"
14811,OhioFisherman,2006-12-21 14:03:00,6623,"OEM parts are expensive, even mechanics that don`t use them usually mark up the price of parts they buy, 25 to 50 percent. There may be a slight difference in quality though. Dealer`s labor rates are over the top, the labor involved(time) can cost more than the part.  Some radiator shops also rebuilt gas tanks, reseal with some sort of coating after the hole are patched."
14818,pikehunter,2006-12-21 14:24:00,1659,"The dealers are always outrageous! As said, find a good mechanic, even better if he works for cash and you have the cash. OEM parts from a dealer are almost always expensive. Fix only what has to be fixed to keep the car in a safe condition. Don't worry about the daytime running lights, as long as your headlights do work you will be fine. After you get the car fixed up at a reasonable price and you feel that it is safe to drive then do just that, drive it into the ground. At least the tranny and engine are strong, if the body is good then you are even better off. The car can probably go another 1000.0000 kms. As for the A/C it's only a luxury, why waste money fixing it?  Good luck."
