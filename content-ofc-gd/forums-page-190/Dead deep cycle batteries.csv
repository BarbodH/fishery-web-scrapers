900132,super dave,2015-02-25 16:12:00,323,"I have 2 deep cycle batteries that are dead.  I know one is done but one might be salvagable.  anyone know what i can do with the dead one and anyone know of a place that can recharge?  I""m in pickering/scarborough.  Thanks!!"
900133,jimmer,2015-02-25 16:28:00,2730,I think metal recyclers will take them. Most places that sell batteries will test the questionable one to see if it's any good still and recharged it for you.
900134,leaf4,2015-02-25 16:30:00,2466,"With the one that's dead dead, you can return as a ""core"" they'll give you $10 towards a new battery, the other I don't know what anyone would do with it other than put it on a trickle charger, though you can have the battery diagnosed to see if it still meets all the cold cranking amps etc its supposed to and that will help your decision to either keep it or buy 2 new ones"
900135,manjo39,2015-02-25 16:33:00,354,"Happened to me last year.  I put it on a charger for a long time, but it did not come back. I took it into where I bought it.  They sent it to the manufacturer and they revived it. It doesn't hold a charge as long anymore."
900136,porkpie,2015-02-25 17:19:00,2521,"Keep it for the next battery as was mentioned.  Saves you $10.  Even if it's just a car battery, they don't care what kind of battery you turn in."
900138,super dave,2015-02-25 17:35:00,323,thanks guys.
900146,John Bacon,2015-02-25 19:17:00,3277,"If you think it might be salvageable try connecting it parallel to a good battery and then connect the charger to the two batteries.  Sometimes this will allow an apparently dead battery to take a charge.  If it doesn't work, it is still worth $10 towards a new battery."
900147,Freshtrax,2015-02-25 19:19:00,2215,"If I have a stubborn battery, that won't take a charge I like to ""zap"" it at 30 amps for a few min. Then put it on a trickle.. Sometimes it works sometimes it does not. something about bubbles on the plates or something."
900148,Freshtrax,2015-02-25 19:19:00,2215,And make sure they are at room temperature.
900152,Blue Lk,2015-02-25 19:41:00,337,"Sometimes deep cycle batteries become sulfated (build up on plates) Some ""smart"" chargers can identify this condition & go into a desulfate mode,enabling the battery to accept charging. My cheap ctc ""smart"" charger has saved more than 1 battery for me when I thought they were finished."
900214,Sinker,2015-02-26 00:41:00,8692,Check the cells for water while your at it. Refill them with distilled if they're low.  S.
900215,wormdunker,2015-02-26 00:46:00,1711,"You need a charger that will go into a de sulphation process which will remove the electrolyte from the plates & possibly revive your batteries.  Battery minder model 12248 is the one I use.  For an education on batteries & chargers go to ""battery stuff.com"" Intense amount of reading but, well worth the info."
900245,slidehammer,2015-02-26 05:23:00,28,"If you are running both the batteries for a 24V. trolling motor, you may want to consider getting 2 new ones and coring out the ones you have."
900254,steelhedrmatt,2015-02-26 11:30:00,278,Bingo!!  Had one battery for my trolling motor last summer that wouldn't take a charge. Popped the cap and it was low on water. Topped it up and it was good to go. Good place to start.
900411,Big Cliff,2015-02-27 10:30:00,6899,"A combination of several of the above:  Check for water and refill with distilled water if necessary  Hooking in parallel to a fully charged battery can sometimes re establish polarity, if your battery is so dead that your charger can't detect polarity, most won't try to charge.  Use a charger that can detect and desulphate a battery.  If all of these things fail, take it to a scrap yard or use it as a trade-in for a new battery."
900413,Canuck,2015-02-27 11:20:00,491,"If they are a pair you use together and they are not very close in capacity, rating etc or if one is OK and the other weak, the bad one will cause the good one to quickly go bad.  Its always best to replace them as a pair. They will last longer.  As others have said, a smart charger that desulfates or a battery shop with a commerical charger can revive some batteries to some percentage of new capacity, but they wont be anywhere near 100% and should only be used solo, if at all."

My cheap ctc ""smart"" charger has saved more than 1 battery for me when I thought they were finished. EXACTLY.......and this is why a on-board charger is so important if you really want to get the most out of all your boat batteries. All modern on-board chargers are ""Smart Chargers"" to keep batteries de-sulfated not to mention how easy it is to just plug in your ""boat"" when not fishing. I would not have a boat without one."
900425,BillM,2015-02-27 13:16:00,17367,I think I need a new pair of Group 31s before the soft water season starts.
900427,Sinker,2015-02-27 13:23:00,8692,The difference from 27's to 31's is night and day. I couldn't believe how much more power I had with the 31's.  S.

900451,Raf,2015-02-27 15:37:00,3495,even the 29 series wally world one makes a big difference compared to the 27 on my 12v 55pd
