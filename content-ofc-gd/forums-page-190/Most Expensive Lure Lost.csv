Bought a jointed shallow raider from the little bait shop off Hali main street. Was prob $25 On the lake, literally first cast I snapped my bail close to early, 30 yards from intended target.  Sure enough a ski hits it before I can crank the handle.  Fight it to the boat where buddy and I realize net is on the dock.  He tries to grab it, pins line against boat and snap.  Muskie swims away with my almost brand new lure It's funny. Long time ago but remember the lure, purchase and experience vividly.  Still a good fishing story between my buddy and I.

So common sense would be to get over to it cut the line and re-tie, well i decided to pull to see how bad it was caught, only to pull a bit to hard and sent it back up the tree where it is now caught and I'm willing to bet still there."

The old original Storm wee warts and wee steelie warts seemed to have like 1 in 6 that would out fish the other 5 consistently, same with their Texas shad lures. Trolling for walleye on Lake Erie with my brother and dad was a good way to find the hot ones to use for bass!"

I also have an affinity to the old Pikie Minnows, and have two jointed ones, one perch like yours and a brown colored one. My favorite as a youngster though was a 1 piece pikie, somewhat smaller than the jointed ones, and it was light green. I still have it, it's been disassembled and ready for a paint job for quite awhile. It was an absolute pike killer back in the day. I think I'll paint her and bring her to Memquisit."

First I was fishing French river in a paddle boat with my grandfather, we were trolling spinners from one side of the river to the other and then fishing senkos once we got over there so I brought two rods. When we were fishing against the rocks, we got distracted feeling in a decent bass and brushed against a cliff thinking nothing of it. When we turned around to go home, we realized my rod was gone.  The second one was my last softwater trip of 2014. A series of unfortunate events caused us to beach my kayak with heavy waves pushing into us, so I had my cousin who was with me sit up on the front and start paddling like mad while I straightened us out and pushed us off. So I push and leap into the kayak, swinging my legs around I grab my paddle just in time to see my rod and reel sinking to the bottom of the lake. That was a baaaaad day."
