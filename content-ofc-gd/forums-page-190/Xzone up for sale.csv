879745,misfish,2014-11-06 22:34:00,29133,"Mark Kulic is the owner correct?   I can remember getting my first baits from him.  Great product.  Not sure why he is selling,but he brought a great product for the bass guys. Drop shot killer and theN he brought the swammer. Awesome laker bait."

879750,Steve,2014-11-06 23:29:00,2075,interesting news.
900143,Lunkerhunter,2015-02-25 18:35:00,455,any updates on this? anyone buy it? I still see them in stores although stock is starting to get low. I cant find the color and size I am looking for anywhere for the slammer and mini slammer. hoping they get things back in order.  I heard the company he gets his mold's made from went out of business or something and he didn't own them. who knows probably just a rumor.  some of the best soft plastics out there
900149,mattaw,2015-02-25 19:24:00,162,"Not sure, but I had tried to stock up when I first heard the news. If anyone has any swammers that they want to get rid of, I'd gladly buy them.  The soft plastics XZone made were first class, sad thing to see really."

900155,mattaw,2015-02-25 20:10:00,162,"Here is an alternative http://www.anglerschoice.ca/Sniper-Shad_p_78.html  I will be testing them, as well as a few others to see what the replacement will be. I'm less than thrilled as they were one of my confiedence baits though... So versatile."
900164,BillM,2015-02-25 20:52:00,17367,Here is an alternative http://www.anglerschoice.ca/Sniper-Shad_p_78.html  Too bad about the colour selection.
900251,fishindevil,2015-02-26 10:10:00,6254,I wish mark all the best and hope he sells it to someone who appreciates his product for sure !!!! He started by hand pouring every single one of his plastics !! And really put care & pride into each one !!!! Best plastics I have ever used !!!!  Good luck mark thanks for many years of xzone !!!
900257,Thrilla,2015-02-26 12:45:00,164," Too bad about the colour selection. I see 14 colors, they are a new product so maybe more will be coming? Just trying to help with an alternative, and the look pretty much like a swammer to me!"
