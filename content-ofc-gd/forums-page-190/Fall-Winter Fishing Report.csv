(aka. its slow at work and im bored)  Fall 2014 was very busy for me, my wife and I had our second child in October so I didn't get a chance to get out very often. the days I did get out I made the trek out to BOQ and put a clinic on the walleye. Many fish over 12 pounds this year and my best year for jigging. I seemed to have the hot stick in the boat this fall every trip out and cracked the biggest fish of the day every time. we fished it right through December while many were beginning there ice fishing season. it was pretty wild dodging ice bergs with the boat and boards as well.  here are a couple of pictures to get the ball rolling.            As the Bay of Quinte began to tighten up my itch for the big walleye remaind. I continued to hammer the walleye but instead of a boat i was sitting on the ice. our best day was a crazy 67 walleye between 4 guys. some tanks too!!              more to follow   "

899287,Lunkerhunter,2015-02-20 18:33:00,455,As the season progressed the bay of quinte began to slow down as it normally does so i switched gears to Lady Simcoe for some whities and lakers. the whities were on fire from day 1 so i never left. hahah also got a few lakers thrown in the mix as a bonus. our best day was 21 whitefish and 2 lakers between 3 guys. i seemed to have the magic wiggle again and landed 12 whities and a laker myself. the slowest day for whitefish so far was 10. gotta love it when things come together.                              always nice coming off the water after a successful day to a beauty sunset like this    a fistful of whitefish. i ended up smoking some lake trout and whitefish in my big green egg and i have to say it was delicous. a few friends were lucky enough to get a piece or two before i ate it all. haha    
899289,Cosmos,2015-02-20 18:41:00,588,Nice fish. You got them dialed in pretty well. Congrats.
899290,Lunkerhunter,2015-02-20 18:43:00,455,a few of the trips out we switched it up a touch and went for some jumbos and were pretty successful. no pics of the perch as we released them all and it was too damn cold to pull out the camera for perch. haha  at the beginning of the year we also hit up some pike which was a fun way to start the season. pete put up a report on them earlier but i will include a few pics again anyway.                  hope you enjoyed the report. i am headed out all weekend to continue the smashfest.  tight lines Andrew
