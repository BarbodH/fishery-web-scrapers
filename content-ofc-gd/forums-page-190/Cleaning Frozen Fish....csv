Thanks to a tip I read here, I went to Family Ice Cabins, Dave is a GREAT guy, that's him on the right...  Lots of fun, lots of small perch. Only three keepers.  Needless to say, with wind chill and all, they were flash frozen. I kept them in the white bucket, put them in the backyard when I got home last night.  What do I do now? Do I have to let them thaw slowly in the fridge, then clean them when they are nearly thawed, and cook them right away?     "
