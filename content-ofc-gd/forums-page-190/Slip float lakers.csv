899463,shimano19,2015-02-21 22:26:00,196,Hey guys going to try a method that I have never tried before. Slip floats for lakers. Here's my question; should I use split shot with a hook below and a minnow or do you find a jig head with a minnow work better. Hoping to catch something trying out this new tactic. Any info is good info! Thanks
899466,Steve,2015-02-21 22:31:00,2075,"i'm assuming you are talking ice out, early spring time?"

Any info is good info! Thanks  We always use sliding bobber for ice fishing. Very good results today. The setup from top to bottom:  Knot, a pearl, bobber, small split lead, swivel, one small split lead near hook, hook, minnow If you need an image I will make one - it's all in the garage, full of ice from today"
899481,shimano19,2015-02-22 00:17:00,196,"Awesome thanks bluegill, do you hook the minnow in the tail mouth or back?"
899489,Bluegill,2015-02-22 01:05:00,197,"Awesome thanks bluegill, do you hook the minnow in the tail mouth or back?  95% I hook the minnow in the mouth. Wait 5 secounds after the bobber is gone before you set the hook.  "
899493,shimano19,2015-02-22 01:26:00,196,Awesome! Going to try it tmrw
899501,Sinker,2015-02-22 02:16:00,8692,"Ive been using slip floats for trout and whities for as long as I can remember. Bluegill has the set up exactly the way I do it, and even has the right floats. (where did you find those BTW???). The tall top is the key, so you can see it from your jigging hole. They are deadly for any fish that swims on the slow days when they dont want to hit your jigging set up, and super sensitive for light biting panfish.  S."

The shown float is a heavier one, just had it on hand. I always make it by myself. It's from eastern white cedar. Image on the float is a whitie. Normally I use a lighter float"
899509,Sinker,2015-02-22 03:28:00,8692,Interesting. Ive never seen anyone use the same set up as I do. Works slick eh?  S.
899512,Bluegill,2015-02-22 03:36:00,197,"Interesting. Ive never seen anyone use the same set up as I do. Works slick eh?  S.  Nooo, it doesn't work. Nooo, never try that - just to play around a bit"
899647,shimano19,2015-02-22 22:24:00,196,"Thanks for the tips guys, it was Definatly fun using it in the hut, once I went outside to fish it was tuff to use due to line freezing and the line not sliding through the float. Fun day"
899656,SirCranksalot,2015-02-22 23:14:00,3291,"I bought some of these at CT and am trying them ohttp://www.joessportinggoods.com/product/rod-n-bobbs-mr.-ice-bobbers-196853-1.htm  The advantage, as I see it, is that the attachment pt is below the water line and so less likely to ice up."
899681,Sinker,2015-02-23 00:56:00,8692,"Yes, the attachment has to be under water. The floats that you slide the line thru the hollow stem dont work as well when its cold.  S."
899686,Bluegill,2015-02-23 01:09:00,197,"Yes, the attachment has to be under water. The floats that you slide the line thru the hollow stem dont work as well when its cold.  S.  Yes! That's why I posted that pic in my sec post...  If anybody would like to use a CT float, look at this example. There is a swivel part attched to the end... You can glue it or just use a shrink tube form CT as shown in my first pic It will never freeze  "
899690,SirCranksalot,2015-02-23 01:20:00,3291,Interesting! So is that just a snap swivel(minus the swivel?) glued to the end? I guess you could just bend a piece of fine wire into a U and shrink tube it on.
899694,shimano19,2015-02-23 01:26:00,196,Ah that looks a lot better
899695,Bluegill,2015-02-23 01:28:00,197,"Interesting! So is that just a snap swivel(minus the swivel?) glued to the end?  I guess you could just bend a piece of fine wire into a U and shrink tube it on.  Yes, a snap swivel end without the swivel - the line under water not through the float! A piece of wire if not too fine would work too."
899739,Sinker,2015-02-23 11:51:00,8692,"I shrink wrap a piece of heavy mono on some, but the snap is the way to go. That way you can add a float to any set up, as long as you have a bobbber stop on the line. Anyone who has fished with me knows I always have a bobber stop on my line somewhere. I use them for trolling as a line counter on spinning reels too. They have many uses, not just stopping a bobber.    S."
899764,SirCranksalot,2015-02-23 14:28:00,3291,"You can clip the sponge ones on too but you need a bead as well as a bobber stop. I'll probably make up a couple of wooden ones when I get the time, but in the meantime the sponge ones seem OK.  What do folks use for stops? I have just used those stringy thingies sold in the stores but 1 of my buddies ties a piece of rubber band tightly around the line."

I have just used those stringy thingies sold in the stores but 1 of my buddies ties a piece of rubber band tightly around the line.  I use yarn, sometimes fishing line, a pearl between stopper knot and bobber  http://www.netknots.com/fishing_knots/bobber-stopper-knot/"
899796,dave524,2015-02-23 18:43:00,4508,"Dental floss makes a real nice bobber stop with the above knot, plus it comes in a  handy little dispenser."
899940,Freshtrax,2015-02-24 06:19:00,2215,I do this with my spreaders sort of.   I set them on the bottom then clip on a big red bobber under the water.   If a fish lifts it you will know also lessens the weight of the spreader.
899950,Sinker,2015-02-24 12:21:00,8692,"I tie my stops with 80lb power pro, and yes, Dental floss does work very well.  The sponge floats work well, yes. Nice thing is you can bend them to clear any ice off them and they dont break.  S."
900225,Rizzo,2015-02-26 01:32:00,4754,i use em for perch fishing for the kids...but only the lines in the hut otherwise they freeze and don't slide.
