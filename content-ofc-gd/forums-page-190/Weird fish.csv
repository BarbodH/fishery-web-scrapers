899845,Fishwilly,2015-02-23 22:47:00,206,   A guy I know caught this strange fish in the Saguenay River in Quebec ice fishing. Any idea what the hell it is?  
899851,kuhaman,2015-02-23 23:05:00,503,"Some type of flat fish, small turbot maybe"
899854,chris.brock,2015-02-23 23:14:00,4053,"I was expecting to see a ling, mud puppy or bowfin.  That's a weird one for sure.  I would guess an exotic fish somebody let go when they shut down their aquarium."
899856,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-23 23:23:00,956,Researched fish in Quebec and couldn't find anything that matches that.  I would let the ministry know.  If it's a new species I would call it BBBUUUTTTTTTT  UUUGGGLLLYYY
899861,Burtess,2015-02-23 23:37:00,901,Looks like a cusk eel but I don't know how far any of those species would come up in fresh water?  Burt:)
899865,kickingfrog,2015-02-23 23:41:00,8333,Lower end of the Saguenay gets all sorts of saltwater stuff from what I remember even the odd shark.
899867,solopaddler,2015-02-23 23:58:00,8605,Rob is correct.
899875,Roy,2015-02-24 00:26:00,13728,It's called a snailfish. They don't get much bigger than that.
899880,Fishwilly,2015-02-24 00:37:00,206,Roy I think you're right. Looked it up and it looks like a sub-species of snailfish. Freaky little bugger!!
899882,bare foot wader,2015-02-24 00:49:00,1354,"so, how'd it taste?  definitely weird looking, don't blame him for wearing gloves to handle it lol"
899901,creditmaster,2015-02-24 01:40:00,190,lol i woudint eat  that if someone paid me to
899904,cram,2015-02-24 01:43:00,1733,Probably yet another poor man's lobster.
899907,Fishwilly,2015-02-24 01:48:00,206,He let it go right after taking picture. Can't say I blame him !!
899911,akaShag,2015-02-24 02:26:00,2073,"Hmmm, looks like a miniature Liberalis slimatae, of the genus Nullus Spinus.  Could be the Justinus Givus Votus, but the proof would be whether the angler had to wash their hands five times until they no longer felt unclean.............  Just sayin'..........  Doug"
899974,Fishwilly,2015-02-24 16:04:00,206,Hey Doug  I know the genus of which you speak.....Maybe he shoulda flushed it down the toilet.
899975,akaShag,2015-02-24 16:06:00,2073,"what, and plug the toilet???"
899986,Fisherman,2015-02-24 17:14:00,7201,"Bahahahaha, good one."
900060,dave524,2015-02-25 00:16:00,4508,"Hey Doug  I know the genus of which you speak.....Maybe he shoulda flushed it down the toilet.  Definitely a parasitic species, not to be returned to multiply, throw'em in the bushes like gobies."

900157,akaShag,2015-02-25 20:31:00,2073,"Sushi?  Around here, folks call that BAIT.  Doug"
