899476,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-21 23:40:00,10439,"With the need to haul thousands of pounds of materials to my cabin site I was in need of a freight sled to do the deed. So I channeled my inner Inuit and built myself a Komatik. The sled it's self weighs in at a hefty 150#'s but compared to the ones they make up on the coast it's tiny at 8 1/2' feet long. The Northern Inuit's komatiks are usually in the 18'-20' range. They also use rope instead of solid tow bars as the terrain is pretty much flat there.  The runners are made of doubled up 2X10's that are glued and screwed together.    On the running surface I used 1/2"" puck board as sliders.    To protect the ends I used 1/8"" aluminium sheet.      The cross braces are made of 2X4's and installed with rope like they do up North. I also used screws and glue. I used the ropes as a backup to the screws and glue and to give it an authentic look.      Now for the tow bar. For this I used a more modern approach. 1 1/2"" tube for the tow bar and 2X3"" tube for the tow bar mount. Fabrication of the hitch gave me a reason to go out and buy myself a mig welder.          For the tongue I used 3/4"" solid round bar with 4 valve springs to cushion the shock on takeoff and stopping.    The tow bar mount straddles the runners and is held on with 3/8"" hardware.    The tow bar is attached with 1/2"" hardware and there are hand made UHMW washers between it and the mount.    The tongue runs through a length of 3/4"" ID square tube. I drilled and tapped it for a grease zerk so I can lube it to keep it from seizing up over time.    Running down each side is 1/2"" braided rope to be used as tie downs.        Going to haul it out to the building site tomorrow."

899483,muddler,2015-02-22 00:23:00,623,"I'm impressed, well done."
899486,Basschaser77,2015-02-22 00:35:00,32,Very nice work!
899487,lew,2015-02-22 00:41:00,12766,"Darned nice job there Dave, really nice !!"
899488,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-22 00:43:00,10439,Thanks y'all!!!
899491,Whopper,2015-02-22 01:15:00,2174,Well done Dave!  And to think I don't even have enough room in my garage to fix my snowblower
899497,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-22 01:53:00,10439,"Whopper I don't even have a nice garage. I'm lucky enough to live next to a glass shop that allows me to use their nice warm shop to work on my toys and such during the long winters. I work on my projects, truck and sled in there."
899498,woodenboater,2015-02-22 01:56:00,2277,"very nice build, should do service for many years ! you're motivating me to get one built as well  curious about the tow bar. The komatiks I've seen and are familiar with, have a lower attachment point (I think usually right between the runners just below the top edge. These would Innu komatiks in Labrador. They also canted them ever so slightly as well. could be a regional terrain thing ?"
899500,solopaddler,2015-02-22 02:06:00,8605,You know what would be really sweet? A giant ice hut sitting on top of the sled. March 31st is the deadline for completion.
899502,Sinker,2015-02-22 02:24:00,8692,"Great job for sure. You know the screws and glue on the cross memberss might not have been thhe best idea though. The reason they use the rope (actually sinew if you want to do it up proper ) is to give the sleigh some flex over un-even terrain.  Its funny, when I moved to Ontario, I built a small one to pull my icefishing gear by hand, and people looked at me like I had 3 heads when I pulled it out LOL. I still have it, and use it every winter.  Great job for sure on that one. It will last a long time. Seal it up with something and your good to go!  S."

I also wanted the tow bar to fold flat against the deck for ease of trailering.  You know what would be really sweet? A giant ice hut sitting on top of the sled. March 31st is the deadline for completion.  That would be sweet. Why don't start work on that tomorrow. You can bring it with you when you come up. If not, we will just have to use what I have.

Yep, I know why they build them they way they do, which is why I added the rope. I won't be travelling very far with this sled. It will be for hauling building materials from the ice road to my building site which is about 1/2km. Also It's way shorter than most of the komatiks which are used up North, about 10 or 12 feet shorter."

899511,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-22 03:36:00,10439,I have some friends that do the dog team thing. One of them is getting ready to run the Iditarod again next month.
899514,Sinker,2015-02-22 03:43:00,8692,I hope to visit your area one of these days. I have a cousin in YK that insists I would never leave if I came to see her. She could be right too!! She also grew up in the small fishing village I did in northern nfld. We use a lot of the same tools aand lifestyles of the people in your area in the winter. Pretty cool stuff! I miss it!!  S.

899521,wormdunker,2015-02-22 08:52:00,1711,That's awesome Drifter!  Heavy duty for sure!  I have to ask - what are UHMV washers?  I do a lot of my own home builds & never came across this item.  How do you like the welder?  I recently purchased a Miller & completed a few projects.  Hell I even tack welded my wife's potato cutter (the type with the lever to cut fries)  LOL!
899528,misfish,2015-02-22 10:18:00,29133,More Newfies live here than in Newfoundland!!!!  LOL   Might explain the Lambs Rum delight. LOL  Nice build Dave.
899532,davey buoy,2015-02-22 11:27:00,5505,"Great work Dave,looks real strong.Sure it will serve you well!!!!!!"
899533,Big Cliff,2015-02-22 11:55:00,6899,"It is always so nice to see the thought and craftsmanship put into projects like these. I really like the way you used the valve springs, what a smart idea!  I believe that the canted runners on the original sleds were to make the sleigh run true which isn't an issue in your case because you have a draw bar.  Beautiful job!"
899544,Ice Fishing Ham,2015-02-22 13:24:00,83,That's one solid sled Drifter. Nice work.

I made the washers out of a piece of 1/2"" ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. I cut the sheet down to 1/8"" thick to make the washers which were then cut out using a 2"" hole saw. They allow the tow bar to move easily in it's mount without having metal rubbing on metal. UHMW is extremely tough and will last forever."

Correct, the Northern sleds have canted runners because they pull with ropes. If they weren't canted the things would wave back and forth behind your snowmobile."
899666,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-23 00:13:00,10439,Took it out to my property today. Fits perfectly on the trailer with the sled.    Looks good behind the sled too.    A couple of shots out at the property.     
899678,Sinker,2015-02-23 00:53:00,8692,Lets see that beast with a full load strapped on it! Looks good!!  S.
