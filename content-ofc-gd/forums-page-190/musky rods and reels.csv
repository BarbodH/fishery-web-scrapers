900087,Fisherpete,2015-02-25 02:41:00,1814,"I do have a Tekota 500, non-line counter version, and yes in a pinch it can be used for casting - but it is pretty heavy and you also have to manually click over the lever to reel after casting, which can be a bit of a pain. It also has a very low gear ratio, 4:1 if I am not mistaken, so you won't be reeling back any baits quickly - which is often a key to triggering muskies. Not a great starter reel for casting - that being said, it's my favourite muskie trolling reel - I use it and also a Tekota 600 with the line counter. They are bulletproof as trolling reels.  I've also heard plenty of bad things about the Cardiffs. Would put them in the same ballpark as an Abu C4.  Lunatic - Black Maxx is one of Abu's lower end combos... not their 'good stuff'. You won't be disappointed in C3, and you will love a Revo Toro."

This is due to the mechanics of the human body. 3: Since there is no switching of hands, during or after the cast, how do you get a palm grip on the reel?  The answer is you don't...By not palming the reel you put undo stress on your wrists as you crank.  This becomes more pronounced as the water resistance of the bait increases.

Garry I am trying to keep an open mind but I just dont see any of these three points applying to the way I cast.  First let me state that I am a left handed in just about everything I do.  Batting, writing, hockey you name it.  I am pretty awkward doing any of those things right-handed so even if the way I cast is technically incorrect the comfort advantage outweighs any mechanical advantage I may gain doing it right.  I cast two handed (I havent casted one handed since the 80s and pistol grips) with the rod over my right shoulder and (lefty) reel handle pointed straight up at the sky.  My right hand is palming the reel and my left is holding the rod at the butt.  It all acts as a sort of pendulum during the cast.  By the end of the cast the handle is pointed straight down at the water and my right arm (and thus the reel) is extended.  I have never had the handle engage the gear, likely for two reasons, one of my reels has a lever drag which also engages/disengages the gear so turning the handle with the gear disengaged does nothing (ok so that one is cheating and I wish all my reels had a lever drag instead of star but that's a different topic) but more importantly the reel is so far out in front of me that there's nothing for the handles to catch.  I'd have to grow my gut by a lot of inches Hahah.  That makes point 2 = not applicable.  Finally, I am palming the reel 100% of the time, and maybe I am not understanding why you'd suggest otherwise.  So much so that I get ""Abu 7001 claw"" and switch up on occasion to holding the foregrip of the rod instead of the reel while I retrieve."

899900,Steve,2015-02-24 01:38:00,2075,"when it was looked into further, the majority of anglers who cast with their right hand, switching the rod into their left hand, and then reeling with their right hand, started using baitcasters when left handed baitcasters weren't available.  simply put, they learned to cast and reel with their right hand because there weren't many alternate options available.  those who are right handed, and started using baitcasters when left handed options were available, more often then not use a left handed baitcaster and cast with their dominant right arm."
899936,Garry2Rs,2015-02-24 05:07:00,1425,"I will be 70 around the time Musky season opens this year.  If most new casters are using lefty reels, perhaps I am a casting dinosaur.  As such, I promise not to criticize lefty-lovers anymore...After today...HAHAHA.  Since now-a-days everyone grows up using a spinning reel.  I understand why folks might think they would prefer a left-hand cranking reel, but there were and are good reasons why cast right and crank right is the standard.  When I was a boy, in the 50's, the crank handles on many bait casters didn't disconnect, they spun backward during the cast.  That, I suspect, was a powerful reason for right-hand cranks for right-hand casters.  As I mentioned, the proper grip for a right-hand caster has the reel canted to the left with the crank up and away.  This of course kept the crank away from your body, and clothes, as it whirled about.  This cant also allows your wrist to bend further.  This is the grip which is taught in tennis for the same reason...  Once the push button clutch was developed, to disconnect the crank during the cast, one argument was somewhat weakened, but not resolved.  To this day, if your crank is inboard during the cast, when you bump or jar it, you are going to have a problem. This is casting mechanics #1.  I have used left-hand reels for pitching and occasionally for casting.  I honestly find no advantage when casting. Switching the rod from right to left happens while the bait is in the air, most of the time.  On the switch, the reel goes into the palm of the left hand.  This palm-grip keeps the rod from torquing up and down as you crank.  Most right handed guys using a left-hand reel, that I have seen, cast with the rod held so that the reel is horizontal. This limits their back-cast and shortens their cast. This is casting mechanics #2.  The most common way to hold the rod in order to cast is with ones finger on the trigger.  Since right-hand casters who crank left don't switch hands, they don't naturally move the reel into their palm.  This leads to fatigue in the wrist, caused by fighting the torque of the reel as you crank. This is casting mechanics #3 and all I have to say on the subject."
899946,cram,2015-02-24 12:04:00,1733,"Yeah but can't you cast a left handed reel the exact same way?  Aim the crank handle at where you're casting (so that the reel is not horizontal) and then you're getting the exact same motion?  I don't get how the reel handle dictates why/how you hold your rod when you cast.  I'd also say that controling the rod with your stronger/coordinated hand has major advantages over the opposite, but as Lew said - everyone is comfortable doing different things."
899951,lew,2015-02-24 12:23:00,12766,"Honestly guys, using a baitcaster is one of the easiest things you'll ever do in your entire life. If your already doing it, your probably comfortable with how you do it so carry on with that.  If your new to it or are wanting to learn, try a left hand reel and if it feels good....carry on. If it doesn't feel good try cranking with your right hand and if that feels good....carry on.  Tossing a lure with a baitcaster is really REALLY easy stuff and there's absolutely NOTHING technical about it.  I took my wife musky fishing last summer for the 1st time and gave her a 2 minute lesson on a baitcaster and withing about 3 casts she was doing it like a pro....'cept she never caught a musky  Go fishing, have fun and definitely DON'T over think it."
899954,Andy,2015-02-24 13:10:00,330,"I use left handed baitcasting reels for casting so I don't switch hands during or after the cast. It's how I started and I just like working a bait like a jerkbait better with my right hand and arm, plus my left shoulder sometimes acts up and gets a little stiff. I will agree with garry2rs that your right hand may get a little fatigued by the end of the day if you don't switch because I do switch my right hand grip from a trigger casting grip to palming retrieve grip all day, instead of handing the reel over to the left hand palm grip. But it's not a big deal. The only time I sometimes wish the rod was in my left hand is when I want to net a big fish, and I can just switch hands with the fish at the boat. All my trolling reels are right handed retrieve, and I find using them a breeze too. Once I have a fish on, I usually forget all about what hand is holding the reel. Lew, is right.

900044,Fisherpete,2015-02-24 23:19:00,1814,"Here's my thoughts again...  If buying new - Abu C3 6500 is the best in the $125-150 range. Add a power handle for sure. Is it a hardcore musky reel designed for day-in day out use? No. It gets the job done for the weekend warrior who might get out a half dozen times a year. Also doubles as a great other species reel - I like it for pike, cats and carp. The C4 is NOT a muskie reel. It looks like a C3, but has no cranking power due to the gearing. I found this out the hard way, bought one new when I was starting out with baitcasters and struggled with it.  I also had an Abu 7000i (red one), and it indeed is big and powerful, but VERY heavy. I just couldn't handle the weight of it as a casting reel. I've seen them for pretty good prices, similar to the C3. Makes an excellent trolling reel.  Suprisingly, there is very little available in the $150-250 range. Okuma released a few reels in the past few years including the Komodo - I think it is around $225, and has gotten some good reviews. I'm not sure what the gearing is like though, I seem to think that it is a only a high speed reel, not a cranking reel but I could be wrong. Daiwa has the Lexa line, which some other members can chime in on. A solid offering in this price range is Shimano's Calcutta B - which is a very good all around reel without breaking the bank. It's a round style reel, which some people are not used to.  Once you jump to the $300 plateau you can pick up an Abu Garcia Revo Toro, there is a winch (4.6:1) and a high speed (6.4:1) model. The winch is one of the best reels out there for bringing in twin tens, and has a very powerful drag. It's also low profile, really light, and sits very nicely in your hand. I had one for two seasons. I still have the HS model, and use it for my jerkbait rod. The fast line pickup is perfect for this setup. Abu also recently released the NaCl line, which is similar to the Revo Toro line in features.  Cross the $400 threshold and you get into my reels of choice - Shimano's Calcutta line and Tranx. The Calcutta TE 400, now discontinued, is my favourite muskie reel. Smooth as silk, round profile, available power handle and fairly light. I can and do throw bucktails - even twin 12 and 13's - all day with this reel. Drawbacks - not the strongest drag system (although a Carbontex drag upgrade is available - I have added this for 2015), and when using the power handle you have to be careful that the weight of it does not cause the bail to close mid-cast - I've done this a couple times and damaged my gears. Thankfully the boys at Shimano in Peterborough have fixed her up each time for me. The Calcutta TE was replaced by the Calcutta D, which is priced around $450. I have nothing bad to say about it at all. I have two of them, and they are my 'all around' reel. Quite capable of bringing in big blades, but with enough line pickup to throw big plastics, crankbaits or whatever you choose. When my TE finally dies (parts no longer available), I won't be too upset knowing that I have the D to fall back on.  Get into silly country ($600) and you can have a Shimano Tranx. Available in low (4.6:1) and high (6.6:1) gearing, this thing is a monster designed specifically for muskie fishing. It's big, built like a tank, casts a country mile and cranks in whatever with ease. Tons of drag also. I picked one up over the winter, and will be battle testing it this season. All the features sound amazing on paper, but I'm curious to see if I can get used to the size of it.  When new muskie anglers ask me what reel to start with, I often suggest the Abu C3 6500. It's affordable, holds it's value well, and gets the job done. Easy to service as well. A clicker for trolling and multi-species capability are also bonuses. If you can find a used Calcutta B, Abu Winch or similar, even better if you plan on throwing blades a lot. No sense dropping $500 on a reel yet until you figure out if muskie fishing is truly your thing.  As for the lefty/righty thing - whatever floats your boat. Some people think it is more important to have your dominant arm on the rod, some prefer it on the reel. Just do whatever is comfortable... you will figure this out pretty fast throwing a twin ten inline!  Sooooo... in conclusion, if your budget is $320, drop $100 on a rod and $220 on a reel... spool it up with 80-100lb braid, a quality leader... and giv'er!!! Looking forward to seeing some reports from all the budding muskie anglers on the board."
900045,Steve,2015-02-24 23:24:00,2075,"why not buy a new tekota 500 and use that.  it'll handle everything a muskie can throw at it, including the largest muskie baits.  its about $240.  you didn't even mention it in all your options (which are all very good btw).  just curious why you wouldn't suggest a tekota?  (yes, I understand the common tekota's ones around here are line counters, but you can certainly still cast with a line counter).  if you're going to be fishing into ""freezing season"", which many muskie anglers do, stay away from Okuma. They don't like the cold ... at all."
900051,Raf,2015-02-24 23:42:00,3495,"the tekota 500 is propably bigger heavier more awkward than a 7000.  i've used a lot of reels.  my currently most used reels are a 7001, a curado 301 and an avet sx series (i think) saltwater reel.  the 7001 is the only one that is an all-purpose reel.  the curado is great for jerkbaits but lacks the power to pull blades and the avet is great for blades but since it has no level wind, is a one trick pony.  the 6500 c3 or 7000 c3 are what i'd recommend to start.  they both have loud clicker and cast reasonably well"
900057,Lunatic,2015-02-25 00:13:00,536,"i find myself more of a rod snob than a reel snob,but you guys arent the first to tell me to spend more on the reel. ive also heard that the shimano cardiff is a good option,but no one mentioned that here  . it might sound silly but im turned off by abu garcia. my first ever baitcast set up was the black maxx combo and that only lasted 2 hours before the rod broke 4 inches from the tip,and the 3rd time out the drag broke.ive replaced both with shimano set up and doing good 2 years in.i had a friend give me his black maxx reel because his rod broke. i wont rule out abu but im ho-hum on it.  my bass and pike set ups are mostly shimano and st.croix. 13 fishing rods have me interested,but i dont think too many here have used them so im hestitant on straying from shimano and st croix.  ill improve my set ups over time,little by little so the wife doesnt notice. if i drop 400+ on a reel or rod,i might be burried with them lol"
900058,Steve,2015-02-25 00:15:00,2075,"ahhh, ok raf, makes sense.  i'm used to feeling like the 500 is small, likely cause I have a million 600 tekota's, as well as a few 700's and one 800.  those are big!  6500 c3 was a great beginner reel for me.  but like was already said on here, DO NOT buy a c4. it won't reel in the bait, never mind a muskie, lol."
900059,Steve,2015-02-25 00:15:00,2075,cardiff's are pure junk.  watched two fall apart (literally) one cold December Quinte trip.
900064,lew,2015-02-25 00:35:00,12766," ill improve my set ups over time,little by little so the wife doesnt notice. if i drop 400+ on a reel or rod,i might be burried with them lol  You may find it worth taking the chance, you'll be amazed at the difference in quality once you step up to that level of rods & reels. My favorite set-up for bucktails & spinnerbaits  is Calcutta TE's on St. Croix Legend Tournament rods and after using them for a few years anything else just doesn't compare.  Lotsa money but well worth the expense in my opinion."
899612,Lunatic,2015-02-22 20:34:00,536,"I dont ice fish so i try to stay away from anything fishing related during the winter (out of sight,out of mind) but the itch is growing... in the fall last year,i started to fish for musky using undersized gear i use for pike so its time to get the proper setup. so i thought id research a bit and maybe pick up something when bass pro has their spring classic.  what gear is everyone using here for musky?  i wont be going too crazy,so my budget will probably be in the 160/160 range rod/reel  anyone use 13 fishing rods?"
899615,Fisherpete,2015-02-22 20:42:00,1814,Budget is 160 rod 160 reel?
899622,Lunatic,2015-02-22 21:03:00,536,"Budget is 160 rod 160 reel? yeah,about 160 for each."
899627,Gregoire,2015-02-22 21:29:00,1397,St croix premier or tackle industries 8ft plus rod XH and revo winch or Calcutta B. Scower the classifieds and try to find them used as that will keep costs down.
899633,cram,2015-02-22 21:41:00,1733,"A good all-purpose musky rod is an 8 foot heavy action rated for 2-6 ounces.  You could likely get an Okuma, Shimano, or Tackle Industries in your range. All are good solid rods.  I'm not sure what the best reels are in your range.  I use an Abu Revo Toro and love it but is likely outside that budget..  Also have a C3 6501 as a starter/backup reel and it has served me well over the years."

899638,Joey,2015-02-22 21:56:00,9122,Best musky rod I've ever had and use every time is a Spiel special custom made.
899662,Pigeontroller,2015-02-22 23:50:00,2793,"If its a do-all set up and you plan on some trolling with a rod holder a clicker is a must. An Abu C3 is a good choice. As Cram stated a good choice of rod would be an 8 foot 2-6 oz. Definitely watch the classifieds, you'll get a nicer combo for the $320 if you buy used.  Muskie Odyssey....April 25th!"
899674,Fisherpete,2015-02-23 00:47:00,1814,"I would see if you can find a used St. croix premier in the 8' range as others have mentioned. Heavy or Extra heavy, 2-6oz. If you get lucky you might find one in the $100-120 range. I would spend the extra $ on the reel. If buying new, an Abu c3 6500 is really the only one in your budget, but as Greg mentioned if you can try find an Abu Garcia Revo Toro winch (60 size). I've seen them as low as $225-250. Bump up your budget slightly and you will be able to pick up a pretty high end combo."
899683,outllaw,2015-02-23 01:03:00,1232,"as pigeontroller stated. try the mci odesseye. there will be deals. and the money generated goes back to research,studies ."
899733,jace,2015-02-23 04:27:00,472,"just brought back an unused C4 6501 (left hand) if you're interested.   ...pretty much identical to C3 except for an extra bearing and slightly faster gear ratio.  I think the gears in most reels from this  line are interchangeable anyways.   the box might not be here, but i could bring it back to ontario another time."
899737,Garry2Rs,2015-02-23 08:03:00,1425,"When putting together this tackle, remember that everything needs to balance. What weight baits do you expect to use?...If you are throwing 1 ounce baits using a 2-6 rod it's going to wear you out! Will you be using  Jerk or glide type baits?...Long rods are in style.  They will cast a little farther...Which is fine if you fish with your rod tip up. However, if you are working a jerk bait, like a sledge, your 8 ft rod will splash in the water, scaring the fish if you're not 7 feet tall. My personal favourite was a St.Croix 7ft Premier rated for 1-3 oz.  It would throw a big weighted bucktail, a 1.5 or 2 oz. Spinnerbait or fish an 8 inch Sledge with equal ease. Abu C3's are okay reels to start with.  They need oil on the worm gear that drives the level wind, almost every time you use them.  If you fail to oil them regularly, the pall that reverses the level wind will wear out and stop working. It is very important to balance the reel to the rod.  If you put a 6000 serie reel on a 2-6 oz rod they will work well together.  If you put the same reel on a bass crank bait rod or a flipping stick, it will be top heavy and will be a pain in the butt to use. In my not so humble opinion, any right-hand person who uses a left hand casting reel is handicapping themselves. Look at any article on Bait Casting and you will see that the reel is supposed to be tilted on its side with the crank hand facing up and away at about a 45 or 50 degree angle during the cast.  This is to allow your wrist to bend properly...If you ever had Tennis lessons you will know what I'm talking about. That said, feel free to listen to those who are smarter than all the reel designers."
899777,mepps,2015-02-23 15:52:00,1301,I highly recommend the Tackle Industries rods as well. Looks like they have a sale on their site for the 7 foot rods.

In my humble opinion baitcasters are predominantly right handed because that became the industry standard.

I am no reel designer, but I know at least one prominent musky angler who agrees with me.

When your riding a bike you get on from whatever side feels best and casting is exactly the same, you cast whatever way is best and most comfortable to YOU.

899789,Handlebarz,2015-02-23 17:47:00,3790,If your looking for a all around rod I like a 8' XH also it will not break your back casting big blades and you can still work jerk baits (like Gary said a 7 is the best for jerk baits) but your after a all around rod that's why I suggest 8' to get started with. The Abu NACL is a great reel as is the Abu Toto winch 60 both would work good for you. I know the reel will be over $160 but I'm sure if you find a good rod used you will save enough to buy a new reel. For your line if your casting I suggest 100lbs braid line.

Most of the round reels out there can get by... The red Abu 7000 reels are pretty cool but a bit bulky... They're around $200...
