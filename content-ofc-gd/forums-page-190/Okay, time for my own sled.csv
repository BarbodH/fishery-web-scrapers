899650,lew,2015-02-22 22:37:00,12766,"    Thanks hon, say hi to Di again today for me, hope she's feeling better!!  Diane says ""hi backatcha"" Joey and yes, she's feeling really good.."
899679,irishfield,2015-02-23 00:54:00,26272,The only real question Hun... Did Paul teach Terry to drive or Vis a versa?  You'll bounce back.. apparently you have done so 4 times before..
899731,Joey,2015-02-23 03:17:00,9122,"The only real question Hun... Did Paul teach Terry to drive or Vis a versa?  You'll bounce back.. apparently you have done so 4 times before..  I'm wondering the same thing.   Terry is usually ahead of us so maybe Paul figured he act ""Terry"" like while he was gone   Yup, I'll bounce back, pretty sore today but coming around!"
899435,Joey,2015-02-21 20:04:00,9122,"Well Paul and I went up for the Tyler Fundraiser today and right off the bat, he jumped a snowbank and the sled went to the left and there I was underneath it again (the fifth time )    So, time for my own me thinks as this man cannot be trusted to drive me around on the snow with a machine ha ha ha.  So my left arm, leg, ribs and neck are a bit sore now and we didn't stay for burgers or anything so sorry if I missed saying hi to anyone, but was in a bit of pain.  Aren't snow machines fun????"
899439,Spiel,2015-02-21 20:11:00,9065,Aren't snow machines fun????  They are when you have your own.
899443,Handlebarz,2015-02-21 20:31:00,3790,I did that to my sisters boyfriend 20+ years ago he never asked to come for a ride again. Maybe Paul should have been nicer and just bought you a sled years ago. Hope you are back on the ice soon.
899444,ketchenany,2015-02-21 20:38:00,3229,I did that to myself many years ago  Maybe you should drive. hope all is well soon.i
899451,misfish,2015-02-21 21:15:00,29133,"Heal up there J. I,ll bet theres a sled in the near future.  Sure wish I had one today. My, there,s a lot of snow north of here,"

899464,mr blizzard,2015-02-21 22:28:00,1589,"Hope you heal quickly,  bought my wife a used 03 polaris last year for the same reason,  no I did not roll it but the person sitting behind simply does not know which way to lean etc  but I would not have the balls to jump a snowbank with her on the back, if I did she would would simply cross her legs everytime I saw her  Your a Taurus,,,,,,you will be up and running on your own machine soon  Cheers Lay on the couch relax and ring the bell everytime you need something, I would milk it for a couple of weeks for sure"

Good to see you aren't too badly hurt could of been a lot worse.  Get your own ride, tons available out there.... Hell get a 2up and make Paul ride in the back.  G"
899539,lew,2015-02-22 12:56:00,12766,(the fifth time)  Any chance Paul's  trying to send you a message Joey ??

Guess I'm driving from now on  I must say, I'm more sore today than I was yesterday. Woke in the middle of the night and usually have a glass of water on the night table, went to grab it with my left arm to take a sip and yelped in pain.   Some kinda hurt today I can tell ya.  Shoulder, ribs, hip and arm."
