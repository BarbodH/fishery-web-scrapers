At first all seemed well and it looked like a great spot to go. But after reading some of the posts on these forums it seems that the lake has become overrun on most weekends by partiers and the fishing isn't quite as good as I would hope.  So I was hopinh for some feedback, is McCrae lake really that bad? Some were saying theres garbage and broken glass everywhere and on weekends you'll be kept up till 5AM because of the shouting and such, And if it is that bad, is there a better place to go? withing a hour or two of the barrie area?  Im looking for  somewhere where I can kayak/portage in and spend the rest of the time fishing a lake or river or both.  Any feedback would be awesome.  Thanks.  [EDIT]  I will be going this summer. figured I should clarify that."

Google Jeff's Map (if you don't already know it) and go for it, can't be much more than 2 hours from Barrie See I was thinking about doing Algonquin but I've been told that the fishing around late June early July when I'm going is not very good. Is this true, or are people just looking in the wrong spots for fish?"
898402,ckewley,2015-02-16 14:31:00,699,I can't speak on the fishing but a freind goes every year around that time & he's never complained about the fishing. Always had good luck but he doesn't target Trout so maybe thats where it differs
898947,Rizzo,2015-02-19 00:49:00,4754,I used to go to McRae 25 years ago and it was just starting to get busy then....can't imagine the zoo now. If someone has a good spot I would imagine they would keep it pretty close to the vest! How about something in Massassauga Park?
