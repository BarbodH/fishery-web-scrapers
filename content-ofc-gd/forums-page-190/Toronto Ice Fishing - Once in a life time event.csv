899053,AKRISONER,2015-02-19 16:02:00,5558,"my intent was to not venture far off the island on the outside. that is, if it freezes up and isnt an ice flow.  They break the channels between the harbour and the island for the ferries to run, but the south west side of the island should be untouched.  Once again, this is all very hypothetical and I dont plan on being the first person out there."
899097,highdrifter,2015-02-19 19:34:00,2534,"Personally, I wouldn't bother with the south shore of the islands..   Unless you get a killer freeze up and you can venture safely out to the salmon/trout zone..  The inner channel at center Island would have plenty of safe ice, you'd be somewhat sheltered, and there are pike and perch to be had, albeit in small numbers..  Also, all the fish I've iced in and around the harbour came during low light conditions, like at first light or on a overcast day.  Focus on offshore structure or to a steep incline in depth, relating to open water.  cheers HD"

899141,highdrifter,2015-02-19 23:07:00,2534,I've been all over.
899281,JoshS,2015-02-20 18:09:00,729,"That's a risky adventure! Plus it'll be a decent trek to get out there not too mention no one around if things go array. I've ice fished the harbour a few times, but protected areas. I put a foot through a few years ago.... I was on 14 inches, walked 15 yards to drill a hole and put a foot through an inch of ice. Scared the crap out of me and have been extra cautious since. I wouldn't risk it out there."
899297,John Bacon,2015-02-20 19:57:00,3277,"I would want the lake to be completely frozen from shore to shore before I head out south of the islands.  A mile or two of ice can break up pretty fast when there are twenty or so miles of open water out there.  If there was a two or three week cold snap after the lake froze solid from shore to shore, then maybe it would be worth testing the ice for safety.  I would want a group of people spread out with float suits over wet suits, ice pics, ropes, etc.  I think that ice forming over an area that does not usually freeze would be much less predictable than ice in areas that usually freeze every year.  I believe that the west end of the lake did freeze completely many years ago.  One day the lake could be crossed on the ice; the next day the ice was gone."
899300,Steve,2015-02-20 20:06:00,2075,colpoys bay.  ice fishing for kings.  no need to risk life on lake O
899328,akaShag,2015-02-20 22:46:00,2073,"You need a bunch of guys from Owen Sound to test the ice for you.  When I used to fish Owen Sound, those <<<ahem>>>> LUNATICS would be out on an inch of ice.  One time a buddy suggested we fish at the mouth of the Pottowotami, so off we went.  I asked him where his spud was.  He said we wouldn't need it - silly me, I figured there must be lots of holes from other folks fishing.  So we got onto the Pot, with RUNNING WATER beneath us, and he kicked a hole in the ice with his heel and started jigging.  I practically crapped myself and got the hell out of Dodge, RIGHT NOW.  Ice fishing on less than an inch of ice over running water, just not my idea of a good time......  If any of you members are here from Owen Sound, yes it is me, THAT Doug................   and let the record show I no longer own an Argo.............  Doug"
899335,moxie,2015-02-20 23:17:00,1566,"I received a picture of a friend of a friend kneeling on the ice off of Cherry St holding a beautiful Brown Trout. And no, it wasn't one that got out of the sewage plant. Braver man than I."
898843,AKRISONER,2015-02-18 16:06:00,5558,"I have been keeping a very close eye on the ice charts, and it looks like we may be in for a once in a lifetime event...lake Ontario might actually freeze entirely over. The current chart today shows that only a small section in the middle of the lake remains entirely open, with thin lake ice making up the majority of the lake. With the upcoming cold snap it wouldnt take much to solidify things up and produce some medium lake ice on big O  What does this mean? for me it means that I might just have to consider trecking to the open side of toronto island for a jig.  Float suit, ropes and picks would be a must, but how many out here would take advantage or a definitive once in a life time opportunity to hard water infront of the Toronto skyline.  Anyone here ice fished for chinnys?"
898848,Joeytier,2015-02-18 16:20:00,3990,"All it would take is one big wind, regardless of temperature, and the ice is gone.  No way will people be walking out on lake O"

898854,porkpie,2015-02-18 16:39:00,2521,"I've risked my life enough on Lake Ontario for fishing and hunting when I was younger and way more invincible. Even if it where possible, I'd leave it to the young studs!  Good luck and have fun!"
898856,mattaw,2015-02-18 16:54:00,162,"I honestly would not risk it. I look at the lake every day when I drive by or am close to it. Things change REALLY quickly, and there are nasty spots of current. Stay safe, but at the end of the day, life is more important than fishing...."
898857,chris.brock,2015-02-18 16:56:00,4053,"I'm not saying it's a good idea, but a lot of people from the island go ice skating when conditions are right, I've also heard the police warn or harass them in their hovercraft but don't ticket them."
898860,Acountdeleted,2015-02-18 17:22:00,2562,That's a brave game. I think I may have to pass.

898865,AKRISONER,2015-02-18 17:58:00,5558,"lol seems everyone thinks im crazy for even considering it.  I will tell you right now I wouldnt even consider it until this next cold snap moves through and even then I would be waiting probably until I hear of other people venturing out.  Once again, Float suit, picks, rope, and dry clothes left on shore would all be a necessity."
898868,Freshtrax,2015-02-18 18:26:00,2215,I don't think it's too crazy with some safe ice and no winds in the forcast.   Could do like they do on superior and drag a tinney out with you.   It's what 400 yards or so off the island for 100 fow.

Have had some bad experiences on that lake and thank God Paul has exceptional boat experience and got us back to shore safe and sound.  Think I'll pass on this one.  Be careful out there if you do go."
898872,manitoubass2,2015-02-18 18:54:00,11391,"Geez, float suit and all, but dry clothes on land?  How far you plan on going?  Even with a float suit your a gonner if you take a dip and have to travel any distance to change.  Even in my training, -20, its very very hard to get yourself to shore, nevermind change. All i had to travel was maybe 70 yards and its insanely hard and very scary.  That was in controlled enviroment"
898873,John Bacon,2015-02-18 19:04:00,3277,"I think it is already too late for safe ice to form on the main body of the lake this year.  There is still a lot of open water on the lake.  Most of the areas that look frozen are just floating pieces of ice.  You can see the wave action if the wind picks up.  Even if an area froze solid; I would want to wait for a prolonged cold snap after the initial freeze to thicken it up.  Otherwise a good wind can break everything up very quickly.  We are already in the latter half of February.  Even if a cold snap froze the lake solid, I think it would break up before it became safe."
898876,ketchenany,2015-02-18 19:26:00,3229,the wind will kill you for sure

899044,Basschaser77,2015-02-19 15:22:00,32,Don't they break up the ice for the ferries to travel between the Islands and the lake shore all winter?

899048,bigcreekdad,2015-02-19 15:31:00,546,Impossible!! How can Lake O freeze entirely with all this global warming?
