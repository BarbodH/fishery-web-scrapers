899086,manitoubass2,2015-02-19 18:20:00,11391,"Here is a question for you all.  Its always said bigger/older fish accumulate more mercury, and mercury is toxic. But fish actually accumulate a far more deadly form of mercury, and thats methyl mercury.  Now, both forms are fat soluble.  So what does that mean when you eat white fleshed fish that are almost all protein???"
899087,manitoubass2,2015-02-19 18:36:00,11391,"Wow nevermind.  A quick search shows methylmercury binds to thiols, especially cysteine.  Thats very bad  Thats where GSH is made and cysteine is needed to make glutatione.  Thats actually more scary then i originally thought, since glutathione is the bodies main antioxidant"

899091,BowSlayer101,2015-02-19 19:07:00,296,Since when are whitefish greasy and since when can you compare simcoe to Ontario in terms of polluted water? I'm just lost lol
899112,Sinker,2015-02-19 20:27:00,8692,Simcoe whities are very fat. I still love them though. I'm not big on lakers from anywhere unless they're smoked. Just like the reel peel.  EVERY lake is polluted to some extent.....so is the air. I bet just breathing is worse than eating a few fish from lake simcoe.  S.
899127,misfish,2015-02-19 22:06:00,29133,"but like I said, to each their own.  Enjoy!  "
899131,fishermccann,2015-02-19 22:12:00,655,Read the book on eating Ontario fish before you say crazy things. Lots of the  fish from lakes further north ARE  more toxic than those from Lake O. Most of the freshwater fish in the stores are from Lake Erie.
899150,Salmonidstalker,2015-02-19 23:41:00,265,"White fish are fatty and oily.  Maybe after you smoke them for 8 hours they are palletable, but thats just me.  If you enjoy them then who cares.  Lake O is worse than Lake simcoe, no question, but all of the lakes around southern ontario are polluted so I choose not to eat fish period.  And of them all, Lakers and Whities...no thanks.   In fact, I don't really eat fish because I know where they come from, including the farm raised fish out there like salmon, trout, tillapia etc.  no thanks.  Sinker, good point.  Breathing that nasty air in the GTA is probably worse.  BUT, to each their own.  I don't hate ya for it lol."
899248,BowSlayer101,2015-02-20 15:39:00,296,"I don't know, most of my whities come from northern lakes, maybe theyre not as greasy as simcoe whities but I've fried, cooked, boiled and smoked simcoe whities and always enjoyed them, Lakers, not so much."
899250,manitoubass2,2015-02-20 15:47:00,11391,I baked whities for the first time last year outta rainy lake. Never found them oily at all.  And the nw ontario lakers are delicious!
899268,BowSlayer101,2015-02-20 17:17:00,296,"Yep, northern Lakers are fantastic, simcoe Lakers are much greasier but still pretty good smoked IMO."
898689,BowSlayer101,2015-02-17 21:27:00,296,"Opener finally came around on one of my favourite lakes and I decided to go into the cold on Sunday and get myself a few lakers. It was cold and we didn't really wanna move around so we just went out, set up and drilled holes, after we put the fish finder down and got comfy in the hut, I quickly became aware that there was no fish under us, lol. It was too late and too cold to move so I decided I would lure them in with some spoons and a set line and later move on to jigs. It was apparent that lots of guys around us were hooking up with tiny lakers but it was ok, because I was after a fight and a fight I got! I was jigging a spoon 20 ft off bottom and saw something come up from bottom, I asked my fishing partner if that was him coming up and before he could reply, the answer was obvious as a laker almost took the rod out of my hand! Had him on for a minute or so and that while time, I couldn't even stop him from peeling line with my 10 lb braid. I dropped down again and hooked a nice fish, much smaller than the previous one but still nice. After that I lost a monster on a set line and a few tiny 15 inch lakers later, I hooked up with a keeper on a set line, took me a while to bring hm up but it turned out to be a real nice fish, a nice sized herring also came out of its mouth as I was pulling it up. Met some guys that got a real nice laker near me, overall was a good day to be out, despite not hooking up with as many as I'd hoped, the cold and having to keep 2 heaters going! Got out again yesterday and managed 10 big herring on a northern lake and lost very likely the biggest whitefish of my life right under the hole on a peeling run, good weekend was had, lots of fun, hopefully have some more fun next weekend!"
898693,grizzlybri,2015-02-17 21:35:00,565,"nice report and great looking fish, how big was that monster in your hands"
898694,misfish,2015-02-17 21:36:00,29133,"Ron thats a nice fish and a great report. Im heading up next Saturday. Looking forward to my first time on Joe. Ya,close to 30 years living in Barrie and never fished it.  If your heading up,give a pm. Would be nice to meet you.  B"
898695,BowSlayer101,2015-02-17 21:37:00,296,wasn't caught by me but it was 25 pounds
898696,Acountdeleted,2015-02-17 21:39:00,2562,Very nice. I wish I could have gotten out there for opener. I heard Chris K saying 'the spot' has been closed down due to police. If I PM could you elaborate?
898697,BowSlayer101,2015-02-17 21:39:00,296,PM sent Brian!
898698,BowSlayer101,2015-02-17 21:40:00,296,"For sure shoot me a pm, ill give you some details on it."
898727,EC1,2015-02-17 23:51:00,930,Good fishing! How was the snow out there?
898737,BowSlayer101,2015-02-18 00:10:00,296,"Thanks,lots of snow, was a hard walk there, easy walk back, using the snowmobile trails"
898801,wormdunker,2015-02-18 07:30:00,1711,Nice fish pix - thanx.  Good to hear Joe has some nice sized Lakers.  Heard lottsa stories of catching much smaller lakers.  And they're good eating.
898818,BillM,2015-02-18 13:10:00,17367,"Nice fish pix - thanx.  Good to hear Joe has some nice sized Lakers.  Heard lottsa stories of catching much smaller lakers.  And they're good eating.  Joe is usually a small fish factory.  You catch a 10lbr out of there, consider yourself lucky (A fish like that should also be released, eat the small ones)"
898834,BowSlayer101,2015-02-18 15:19:00,296,"I ain't doing that drive for 15 inchers lol, 5 lbs and up for me if I can get them, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Lots of small fish for sure but if you're willing to sacrifice quantity, you can get big fish in certain spots."
898850,Joey,2015-02-18 16:20:00,9122,"Very nice, looks like good day.   Lots of snow up there for sure from the last pic - wow!!!!"
898869,BillM,2015-02-18 18:35:00,17367,"I ain't doing that drive for 15 inchers lol, 5 lbs and up for me if I can get them, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Lots of small fish for sure but if you're willing to sacrifice quantity, you can get big fish in certain spots.  This is why I don't fish Joe for big fish    The steady action is fun though."
898877,misfish,2015-02-18 19:27:00,29133,"Bills back. LOL  I know a fella that has a cottage on the lake. He has caught some real tanks out there. Then again,he fish,s it all summer.  I,ll take 2 x 3-5 pounders. I hope they are not as greasy as the Simcoe ones."
898883,Sinker,2015-02-18 19:58:00,8692,Biggest ice laker I ever caught was on Joe. Lots of good fish in there if you know where to go I guess.  Nice report! I haven't been up there for a long time!  S.
898903,BowSlayer101,2015-02-18 21:33:00,296,"Yup, exactly if you know where to go, its easy to get big ones, I've had days on Joe where I was hooking up with 15-20 Lakers a day, all over 5 lbs, I've had fish that I couldn't even move, for some reason on Joe, the 8+ poundrs get off really easy for me, especially when they get near the hole. On simcoe they seem to be more cooperative for me lol."
898905,misfish,2015-02-18 21:37:00,29133,"Looking forward to my first visit this weekend, is all I can say."
899036,Loadman,2015-02-19 14:57:00,63,not sure why someone would keep a fish that size (to eat it would be gross)
899052,misfish,2015-02-19 15:58:00,29133,"You should see the size of the ones they keep out of Simcoe. I,ll bet most get smoked so it,s not that gross after all. IMO"
899056,BillM,2015-02-19 16:12:00,17367,"You should see the size of the ones they keep out of Simcoe. I,ll bet most get smoked so it,s not that gross after all. IMO  Joe is a self sustaining population though, selective harvest is a good idea."
899057,Salmonidstalker,2015-02-19 16:18:00,265,"If you have to smoke something just so its edible, thats pretty gross in my opinion.  To each their own I guess.  Ive tasted lake simcoe fish (perch,whitefish,lakers) and they're not good at all.  The whole lake is polluted thats for sure."
899062,misfish,2015-02-19 16:47:00,29133,"Lakers for sure I don't like here, but the white fish and perch are awesome. I don't smoke them.   Im sure the trout are much more eatable then those rainbows and chinnys that come out of Lake O.  NOW THATS GROSS. LOL"
899068,AKRISONER,2015-02-19 17:30:00,5558,lake O rainbows are delicious....and have you seen lake O's water? its crystal clear....ya the lake is full of mercury and lead but that doesnt effect the taste.  Would you eat a big pike out of a small pond? helllll no.
