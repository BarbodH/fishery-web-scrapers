899613,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-22 20:38:00,956,Honestly I don't think it matters if they are Canadian or not.  It all comes down to how there parents raised them and in this case they raised them to be generous people.
899632,lew,2015-02-22 21:40:00,12766,You can tell they are Canadian....lol  And darned proud of it too !!
899667,Roy,2015-02-23 00:17:00,13728,"I'm proud of it too but I feel bad to think that Canadian kids are thought to be better than others. I've met and heard of MANY very well brought up, polite kids from all over the world. The parents make the difference in most cases."

I agree with you Roy about many well brought up kids come from good parents and not places."
