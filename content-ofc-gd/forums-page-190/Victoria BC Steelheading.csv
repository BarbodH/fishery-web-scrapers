Cowichan Fly and Tackle now changed to Gord s Fly Box has Drift boat specials for $180.00 for 5hrs. Fish are starting to enter the rivers now and will be in full swing when you are there. Lot s of places to fish there but be sure to check the regs, They become rather tricky along the Cowichan. If not choosing the Cowichan  then I would try Sooke or the Stamp river up island."

899542,Mike P,2015-02-22 13:04:00,19,"I've caught salmon from the breakwall before, also flounder and numerous types of bottom fish. Try using Buzz Bombs, Zelda or Pline lures and jigs in the 2 & 3oz size found in any store out there. The winter feeder chinooks are around Victoria at the moment in the 5lbs to 12lbs range. Langford and Elk lake also produce from shore at this time of year. Both lakes are very close to Victoria."
