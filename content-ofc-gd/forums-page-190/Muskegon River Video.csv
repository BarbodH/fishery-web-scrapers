The piece I wrote on the trip is coming out in the March issue of the mag. Until then here's a pretty cool video of some of the action.  Cheers

I'm curious, why is it so popular to head south of the border, better water, stocking?  Depends on precisely where Stateside you mean Chris. If it's Michigan which is where the Muskegon is located, it's the closest thing we have to a west coast steelheading experience here in the great lakes. It's a big, powerful, wildly beautiful river and is best fished from a jet boat or drift boat. We have nothing quite like it here in Ontario.    You truly have one of the worst jobs on the planet Mike, I don't know how you get up in the morning! Incredible video, love that river (never fished it mind you, but one day), your Sutton River piece & video drive me mad with envy.  Excellent, it's nice to know my master plan is working."
