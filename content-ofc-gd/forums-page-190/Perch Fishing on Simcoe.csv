Thanks to my buddy and his 4x4 truck we didn't have to walk anywhere. We had some luck, but the fish were definitely not biting. We could see them coming up to our baits then turn away. It had the potential to be a great day, but alas, my buddy only brought home a single meal. Could not find any minnows to purchase around the area we went to which was a downer. However, I still think that they would not have made much of a difference. This is the double header I caught while my buddy was out of the hut fiddling around with something. LOL  "

899987,jimmer,2015-02-24 17:21:00,2730,"I wasn't uncomfortable without minnows. Just mentioned that we couldn't get any. It's always nice to have a set line while jigging. We used a piece of worm which did catch some and were wondering if the minnows would have made a difference. I find the wax worms fall off easy, but the fish love them."
