899723,Roy,2015-02-23 02:26:00,13728,Well played guys. Thanks you Cuzza and everyone else who bid and a large thank you to Simon for offering up the trip.

899815,Pikeslayer,2015-02-23 19:55:00,1443," Hi John, Yes we will get out this year (you were not forgotten  ) and No, there is no need for additional $$$ Let's touch base closer to July to pick some tentative dates.  Simon"
899886,steelhedrmatt,2015-02-24 01:02:00,278,"This was my first time at this event and I had a great time. Fishing wasn't great for us. Started off at my hut and weren't marking a thing. Headed deeper to try for a trout, but no luck there either. Ended up going for perch near snake island and got about a dozen jumbos, but not big enough unfortunately.  We almost didn't make the weigh in due to my buddy hitting a crack near the island and losing everything in his pail. Had to double back and pick everything up. All in all, we had a great time and plan on doing it again next year. Thanks to all who helped organize. Great job!!!"
899919,Fisherpete,2015-02-24 02:59:00,1814,"I'll have some pics posted in the next day or two - stay tuned folks. Mo is emailing them to me.  It was certainly a fun time despite the lack of fish, but hey, fish are secondary on day like this. Elise was very grateful for the continued support from OFC, and didn't even know that we had done the auction - so when I presented her with the envelope containing $485 it was nice.  It's great to see that Tyler continues to progress, his speech has come along even in the few years that I have been involved with the event. That's the whole point of this event - to help with the costly therapy to help Tyler to grow - so I would once again like to thank all the OFC members who attended, bid on the auctions or supported in other ways.  I'm looking forward to getting out with Gallie and akaShag - these trips have been a blast and I'm sure these will be the same!  Brian - next time charge your battery LOL - your Marcum might work better hahahahaha  Pete"

899929,[email protected],2015-02-24 03:37:00,57,"Hi Everyone,  Tyler is finally asleep and Roy gave me a new password so I could get on here and do some communicating with all of you wonderful people.  Fishing for Tyler was great fun again this year. We had 80 people registered although not all of them were fishing. The weather wasn't in our favour again this year with the snowy morning but at least there was no wind. On Saturday, we raised $1903.10 which included the auction money from  Fisherpete and a donation from Freshtrax. I wasn't expecting to receive that money. I heard that people were trying to get an auction going but I was struggling to get the tournament organized that I couldn't get online to check in. Thank you for doing that Fisherpete and I just heard from Pikeslayer who also offered up an auction item. Thank you gentlemen.  I am sorry for all the confusion this year with the tournament. Our family has had a difficult year and we struggled about whether we would be able to organize it this year. We forged ahead and then had difficulty with the town about the date, insurance and parking. The town has always been supportive and continues to be. Although Terry and I have been struggling with health issues, I am proud to say Tyler is doing remarkable well. He is still doing his speech and occupational therapy and we have discovered a music therapy that has him practicing and working on his speech but through his love of music. That kid won't miss an appointment. He LOVES going.  Tyler was at the tournament again this year walking around with his little sister, posing for pictures and even called some prize numbers through the megaphone. He was and continues to be awesome.  Thank you to all who came out, to all the auction donors and bidders and everyone who couldn't make it thank you for thinking of us. I will send some pictures to Roy to post. My phone froze so my niece took some.  Cabela's in Barrie were our new supporters this year.  Our winner was Joel Roberts of Bradford. He caught a 31  3/4 inch lake trout. Our second largest fish was a 20 1/4 inch lake trout caught by Denny Spuco.  Largest perch caught was 13 inches caught by Steve Vendramine. Second largest perch caught was 12 1/2 inches and was a four way tie. Jim Broome, Paul Kindy, Steve Garrison and Kaitlyn Lane.  Thank you OFC, Roy, and TJ for your continued support and thank you Maureen Motiv8r for getting this ball rolling 12 years ago. Thank you also to Chevy4x4 for always coming through with tables and helping with set up and clean up. You and Shelley are dear to our family's heart.  Elisa French"

I'll post one here by this evening, I was the event with Pete. I won't have any pictures to post but I'm sure some will turn up"
899484,grizzlybri,2015-02-22 00:27:00,565,"What a great event today up in Innisfil and a great turn out. I believe I heard them say that they had 76 people registered for the event this year. Unfortunately I myself did not get any pictures, so hopefully another member will be able to post some.  I got there at 5:30 and the park was empty with the exception of Tyler's father and another gentleman (sorry forgot your name). Shortly after I arrived a 5 others had showed up including FisherPete who I spent the day with fishing.  We got out to a spot about half an hour or so before sunrise. We dug out enough snow to get Pete's hut right down to the ice which took about 20 minutes before we set up his hut, it was at least another half hour before sunrise.  We fished the spot from about 7 to 11. We were marking a bunch of fish, but nothing was biting for us at this spot, we were in 78 FOW  We finally moved into 40 FOW and Pete started catching perch, nothing bigger then 6"",  I had a few bumps and nibbles but nothing at this spot again.  After this we moved into 28 FOW and Pete kept marking perch then we marked something big at bottom which we both believe was a whitefish, but by the time i could get my Meegs down it was to late.  To finish the day we ended up in 30 FOW and by this point I knew i was going to be skunked on the day, but gave it a go and nothing.  We decided to head into the BBQ around 12 and got to the parking lot, to hear of some of the big fish that were caught. While waiting for everyone to come in we see one young fellow  coming in and in his hands was a 31 1/2"" NGL Trout.  OFC member Chevy4x4 had the biggest perch at 13 1/2""  There were a bunch of 12 1/2 perch also and a big Whitefish but can't remember the length on it.  When the draw prizes were being given out, at one point i joked with Pete saying the next one was going to be mine, and it turned out that it was his number called. At this point he present the French family with the money raised from the two trips he offered in the auction.  They once again had the polar bear dip at on the lake at the same time once again. Driving to the event early this morning was not the best but because it was so early, there were to many people on the roads so it made it bearable.  The drive home (Milton area) was much bad, It was snow packed highways the whole way. With the worst spot being from Canada's Wonderland/Bass Pro right to the merge onto the 401. Then the 401 wasn't any better even with traffic reports saying the plows were out I didn't see any   Overall it was a great day and glad to see as big as a turn out considering how the weather was. Looking forward to it next year. When I'll be offering up something to raise money. I mentioned it to Pete and he thinks its a good idea, however I  will not mention quite yet.  Sorry once again for not having any pictures myself. Hope to see you all out in 2016"

897363,motv8tr,2015-02-11 08:59:00,2587,"Hey all, sorry for the late notice, I realize some people have made other plans for that weekend.  I think Tylers family had a hard time with the town getting parking and insurance as they no longer have their winterfest.  As for the auction  Tyler's mom I believe is working with Roy on that.  Meegs I can meet up with you somewhere in Barrie area on my way home from work one day, PM me and we can work out a date and time.  Thanks all for the continues support  Maureen"

Unfortunatly I will not be able to attend this year because of the late notice we already had plans that I can't change."

If you did, or know someone who offered an item could you send me a PM or post it here?  Tyler's mom has been struggling with a few things, one being a computer that is tempermental.  She has not heard from anyone as yet, and I don;t think is comfortable asking here on the board.  Thanks  Maureen"
