899308,Billy - Curtiss,2015-02-20 20:51:00,241,"I have just purchased some 60 lb Seaguar,  barrel swivels,  and duo lock snaps and I am going to attempt making fluorocarbon leaders for the first time ever.  Searching the internet,  I cannot seem to find much in the way of tips.  I'm thinking of making them a foot long a piece and I'm not clear on what the best knot would be to use.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated."
899309,rocko0305,2015-02-20 21:02:00,6,"I'm not sure how much my reply is going to help you, but I made 80 lb. fluorocarbon leaders for pike fishing for my NWO fly-ins, and they turned out great. I crimped a barrel swivel to one end, and then just a coastlock snap to the other end. I like the coastlock snap better than any other, but to each their own.  The coastlock snaps I bought came with a barrel swivel attached to them, so I had to cut that off, because I found no need for having 2 barrel swivels on my leader (none of the expensive pre-made ones do either, and I was trying to replicate them).  The last thing I did to make the crimp even more secure, was to carefully use a lighter and burn the end of the fluorocarbon after I had trimmed it close to the crimp, so that it created a mushroom that could not slip the crimp.  They have worked amazing to this day."

899312,rufus,2015-02-20 21:16:00,267,I use the canoeman loop knot. I did a strength test when I first started making muskie leaders and the hardware would fail before the line would break at the knot. Other knots I tried all broke at the knot.
899313,Andy,2015-02-20 21:16:00,330,"I had the same questions you do when I made some 80 lb flouro leaders. I initially used the Crawford knot, but I found that it seemed to have inconsistent knot strength in lower lb tests with mono. So I now use the perfection loop. I've tested it and it holds up great. I have made a few leaders with a short length (3-4"") of 124 lb single strand wire at the snap end, and for these I used the canoe man loop knot. It's very easy to tie and it seems to be consistently strong in lower test mono. There are videos and photos on the 'net. It's commonly used by saltwater guys, so it should work for us freshwater fellows as well. Andy"
899323,kickingfrog,2015-02-20 22:33:00,8333,"As to length it would vary depending on the application and target species. Trolling leaders tend to be longer (3-6 feet is common depending on cover and rod length). Casting tend to be shorter, but also consider the baits used."
899324,Roy,2015-02-20 22:34:00,13728,"If you're going to knot your leaders, go to the perfection loop for sure.....especially in that pound test category."
899329,Roy,2015-02-20 22:49:00,13728,You can also try this method. 
899359,Fisherpete,2015-02-21 01:43:00,1814,I had a low 30's pike bite clean through 50lb floro a few weeks ago... Watched it happen at the hole. Really suprised me. First time I've ever had a pike or musky bite thru floro.
899362,OhioFisherman,2015-02-21 01:49:00,6623,"Don't cheap out on your snaps or swivels, get name brand items, make sure they are rated for at least the strength of the line."
899384,rufus,2015-02-21 02:53:00,267,I am using 130 lb Seaguar Big Game. No danger of a bite through. Even with line that thick the canoeman loop is easy to tie.
899391,Fisherpete,2015-02-21 04:36:00,1814,"Yep I've never had a bite off with 130 and 150lb Seaguar. Tough as nails. I crimp my leaders, but may try tying a few this year. One brand, Stealth I think is the name, ties AND crimps them. I might try figuring that out..."
899396,Raf,2015-02-21 13:18:00,3495,"dont kid yourselves, any lb fluoro can be bitten through.  pike & muskie teeth are serrated like razors.  the odds of it decrease as you go up in lb, but it can still happen.  you want 100% bite proof, use wire.  i still use fluoro, primarily for blades, but use wire (single strand bicycle spoke stuff) on my jerkbaits and coated multi strand on trolling leaders."
