I've been up and down about the benefits/downfalls of vaccines for animals for years now.   I'm certainly going to research it.

Always happy and spunky. Seen no need to give her any shots since she was a lap/house dog. She past at the age of 11. Thats a good life for a coakapoo. She ended passing due to cancer.  We now have Gizmo,   a Yorkie. He is the same. All puppy shots then nothing after. He is no different then what cuddles was, Happy,spunky and a good friend. Pain in the ass at times,but he,s our friend."

But when he gets it orally he has no bad reaction. Ask your vet if this particular vaccine can be administered in ways other than intravenously. My hound always gets her kennel cough shot and got kennel cough this year......we asked the vet how can that be.........he said just like the flu there are different strains of kennel cough....seems like a waste of time and MONEY IMHO.

Otherwise I wouldn't bother with it. YEP, that's exactly what happened to us. You can't board the dog unless they have the shot and we can see the logic in that. HOWEVER, the kennel also does dog grooming and those dogs don't need a shot so we think it might have come from there."

899879,Joey,2015-02-24 00:36:00,9122,"Hi all, every year Ralphie has a very, very bad reaction to the Leptospirosis vaccine, so bad that we do all his vaccine shots a few weeks apart.  So today was the Lepto shot and sure enough, he's shaking like a leaf, acting like he's stoned, lethargic, not hungry and just basically not moving.   I have already called the vet and we have been through this every year since I've had him and he pulls out of it within a day or two, so they told me not to worry, but said to take him to the emerg vet if I see any hives or swelling.  So my questions are, has anyone ever had this problem with their dog and do you think this vaccine is necessary?  Thanks for the input.  Joey"
899881,chris.brock,2015-02-24 00:49:00,4053,"No knowledge about that specific vaccine. Vets are like used car salesmen IMHO. I don't do any vaccinations for my cat and dog, they are both 13, eat turds, drink swamp water, and look like they are in their prime."

Edited to mention:  I don't like the heartworm vaccine either (well the liquid you have to put on their back), but we do have mosquitos in our backyard so I do worry about it.  Not sure what to think about that either.  Any other opinions on the heartworm med???"
899888,porkpie,2015-02-24 01:10:00,2521,"Hey, I'm not saying its not a risk, but its a low risk.  If your doing heartworm meds anyway, then you might as well get the one that is combined with flea medication as your dogs are likely to get fleas.  We get mosquitos at my place as well.  I have a friend who is a Vet, and I asked him in his 15 years of practise if he'd ever diagnosed a case of heartworm.  His answer, no, the only place he had ever had any experience with heartworm was at the Ontario Veterinary College.  We all have to do what we are comfortable with.  I play the odds, after all, its my wife's dog.... lol."
899890,Rich Clemens,2015-02-24 01:11:00,3131,"We follow the recommendations for vaccinations for both of our dogs.   We also use Heart Guard and something for fleas and ticks.  When we kennel them in the summer, most kennels require that the dogs be up to date on all their shots.   This is also a requirement for crossing the boarder coming to Canada.   We have to be able to prove they are current on their shots and we have been asked for the paper work a couple times coming into Canada.    Fortunately everything was in order and had no problems."
899891,Joey,2015-02-24 01:18:00,9122,"Thanks Rich, I understand why they would want that.   (Yet vaccinating your child for measles isn't mandatory, go figure, yet that's another discussion).   I have always gotten Ralphie vaccinated every year and always give him his heart worm meds. Before Ralphie I had a cat for 18 years and before that a dog etc, etc, but never had one ever get fleas, so I guess I'm lucky.  Okay, well I guess I will continue to do the Lepto every year, it's just so heartbreaking to see him in so much pain tonight"

899894,Joey,2015-02-24 01:28:00,9122,Basically they said this med is if your dog lives in an area where there are racoons (which we do and we walk in the park where there are alot of racoons).   I guess I should research it a bit more to find out why.   Was just wondering if anyone else's dog had bad reactions to meds and what they thought about them.  All responses are very helpful and I thank you all for them.   I'm going to find out why the vet mentioned racoons and why this shot is necessary as he already had his rabies shot this year.

We have no rats in the house, but I've seen the occasional mouse from time to time so not sure if that counts and we usually get rid of them pretty fast with traps when we do notice them.   They only come around every few years.  Not sure if it is a shortage of food outdoors or what or of the neighbours stopped putting birdseed out and they are scrounging.  Anyhow, had no mice this winter.  Just had Ralphie 3 years now and the first year we gave all 3 shots at the same time (not sure what they are, but I know Lepto and Rabies for sure) and he was so sick.   The next year we did the same and he was so sick again the vet decided not to give him all the shots at the same time.

I did a fair amount of research and talked to breeders as well.  In my opinion if they are vaccinated once, they will carry the antibodies for life, much like we do.  In some cases they don't even need to be vaccinated to carry the antibodies, and in other cases, the cure is milder and easier on their system than the vaccine.  If you have a concern as to the protection your dog has you can have what is called a titre test done, this will work for rabies as well.  The results from these are as valid as proof of vaccination.  Look up Dr Jean Dodds who has been researching animal vaccines for years.  Maureen"
