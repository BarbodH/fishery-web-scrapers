Let me know how it turns out for you.  One spring under 2 of the upper recoil dogs/claws was broken. Since this springs are not available alone I had to buy a compl. recoil repair kit. In this kit there are 2 of those springs and other parts includet. Dealer replaced the spring and gave me the other parts. Labour: 15 $, repair kit 19 $  I think, a very fair price."

Post the name of that dealer because they did very well by you! Any other shop would have charged you at least double what you just paid. It is nice to see that there are still honest shops out there!"
