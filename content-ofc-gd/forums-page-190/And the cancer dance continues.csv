895779,Joey,2015-02-03 18:23:00,9122,"Sorry to hear that Bruce, Paul and I send our thoughts and good wishes!"
895810,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-03 21:04:00,8243,"We are saying our prayers. Like I always say even though I'm not religious I am somewhat spiritual and prayers are good. My very dear friend and boating buddy that I spoke of earlier, Kevin Henderson, lost his battle with this God awful disease yesterday. He fought to the end, I know that because he was still strong enough to argue with me just last Sunday about who knows what and hung up on me. It would have been the last time I would talk to him. I really don't feel bad about that because that was are relationship, I say black he says no way white. I'll miss those tiffs we always had."
895811,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-03 21:06:00,8243,Our prayers are with you Sir.
895816,crappieperchhunter,2015-02-03 21:21:00,2582,"Was hoping that you folks where done with the ""C"" word Bruce.  Wishing Judy all the best for this go around."
895819,davey buoy,2015-02-03 21:33:00,5505,"Bruce ,just a small speed bump,this will be behind the two of you before you know it. All the best."
895821,irishfield,2015-02-03 21:34:00,26272,Tell Judy to keep plowing forward.. asking questions and taking names Bruce! All of those ARE important and part of the puzzle.
895838,spincast,2015-02-03 23:16:00,3279,sorry to hear that Bruce - best wishes and be strong.
895897,wormdunker,2015-02-04 06:33:00,1711,"Hey Bruce - I missed most of this post being out west working.  Just got caught up with it.  My prayers to Judy, yourself & the rest of your family."
900103,bigugli,2015-02-25 04:51:00,6138,"  Sadly, I heard this evening that he did not make it. Over the course of Judy's treatments. Mazz's sessions often overlapped. We got to talk a fair bit about fishing. It was a welcome distraction for both of us, I guess. His wife and Judy would talk about other things . Stopped hearing from Barry before the summer, and kind of guessed the rest. Mazz was an avid angler, and a good man to talk with. I know he will be missed by many."
900104,bigugli,2015-02-25 04:56:00,6138,"Despite the forementioned news, we have some good news, and some not so good news. After all the testing, Judy is, touch wood, cancer free. That is one sigh of relief. On another note, one kidney has shrunk. Possibly related to the kidney problems she experienced during chemo. lastly, Judy is not a candidate for reconstructive surgery, and that really has the Mrs upset."
900107,crappieperchhunter,2015-02-25 05:42:00,2582,Debbe opted out of reconstructive surgery 18 years ago when she went through it Bruce. Has never regretted that decision either.  I hope after the initial shock wears off Judy takes a deep breath and realizes it really isn't an issue at all.
900113,lew,2015-02-25 12:03:00,12766,"Good to hear the cancer has finally been beaten Bruce, really good news."
900124,Joey,2015-02-25 14:59:00,9122,Nice to hear that Judy is cancer free Bruce.  Hope she does okay with the shrunken kidney.
808662,bigugli,2013-09-20 22:34:00,6138,Emend is the new med Judy is trying this week.
808670,spincast,2013-09-20 23:03:00,3279,x2 - Our thoughts and best wishes for you and your family Bruce.
813029,bigugli,2013-10-16 02:01:00,6138,"Well, session 5 has been cancelled until Judy can get rid of a nasty cold bug. Good thing too. She's been feeling right miserable the past few days. The past few weeks I've been wearing the pink ribbon around my hat at market. It has certainly attracted attention   On a darker note, My Aunt Betty slipped peacefully, without suffering, an hour ago. A lively person who marched to the beat of her own drum, I will miss her deeply."
813041,HTHM,2013-10-16 02:56:00,4082,My condolences with your Aunt.
817188,bigugli,2013-11-07 02:00:00,6138,"Been a few weeks. Judy has had a very busy, and rough time of things. Started a new Chemo 2 weeks back, Taxol. Creates a lot of muscle and joint pain and neuropathy. She also threw a couple of blood clots as a complication to her chemo regimen. They missed them on the first ultrasound, and only found them when they realized they could not start an IV due to moderate edema. Now she gets to give herself 90 days worth of heparin injections to break down the clots. Thankfully, today's chemo session was relatively uneventful."
817200,Old Ironmaker,2013-11-07 10:29:00,8243,"As an individual that was very lucky a few years back with the Bladder thing, a cystoscopy and 6 month scopes I just thank someone up there. I'm not a religious guy but my prayers for you all can't hurt.  BigUgli, I'm not that far from you, if there is anything I can do for you just PM me, plenty of time on my hands right now and time to lend one."
817223,LeXXington,2013-11-07 14:25:00,1928,My thoughts are with you and your family.  Sorry about your Aunt
819430,bigugli,2013-11-21 23:44:00,6138,"Well, another rocky week while we continue the cancer dance with 5 days of clinics. Judy still runs into difficulties with her IV's. Nothing goes easily. Usually an hour or more to start an IV. She had a picc line, but that occluded and plugged after one treatment. It also caused a few DVT's in the arm. After 2 days of attemting to do a CT, they have found a couple more small DVT's in the lungs. All of that is treatable with a daily diet of Heparin for a few months. There is light at the end of the tunnel. One more chemo treatment for Judy to undergo. The better news is that radiation treatments will not be necessary"
819433,Ralph Field,2013-11-22 00:07:00,1018,Great to hear that she will be spared radiation treatment. Stay strong !
819447,NANUK,2013-11-22 00:58:00,797,"Best wishes for your wife, stay strong, its good to talk to family & friends in times like this."
819448,Joey,2013-11-22 01:01:00,9122,"Well good news with bad, but sounds like more good at the moment.  Our thoughts are with you and Judy right now Bruce.  Take care of yourself!!"
819502,bigbuck,2013-11-22 03:19:00,2449,Take the bad along with the good. Good to hear that she gets to dodge the radiation. Hopefully one more round of chemo and you guys get to go on with the rest of your lives. Good luck!!
819507,bigugli,2013-11-22 03:36:00,6138,"I'm glad for the good news, as is Judy. It's just hard watching all the complications, endless clinic visits, extra tests, wear Judy down. Its also hard to look after things when you keep having to go back again the next day, and the next, and the next...  But with any luck, we'll be done with most of it before Christmas."
819541,bigbuck,2013-11-22 13:53:00,2449,"The complications are just speed bumps on the road to recovery. I went through hell and back to get my body to tolerate the silver bullet for lymphoma, rituximab. It almost killed me but with perserverance, we got it into me. Grind it out and keep smiling for your mrs."
819699,irishfield,2013-11-22 23:31:00,26272,What Bigbuck said Bruce... don't let the hurdles get to you! Not the easiest thing to do.. but stay the course and keep the faith.
822165,bigugli,2013-12-04 21:23:00,6138,"Chemo is done. Dr. is pleased with the results.  Touch wood, Judy and I can get back to a semi-""normal"" life"
822173,davey buoy,2013-12-04 21:48:00,5505,"Chemo is done. Dr. is pleased with the results.  Touch wood, Judy and I can get back to a semi-""normal"" life Great news Bruce !!!!Glad to hear that!"
822175,irishfield,2013-12-04 21:54:00,26272,The best Christmas present you can ask for Bruce!
822197,spincast,2013-12-04 23:25:00,3279,Now that's a Christmas present! Good news indeed
822232,bigugli,2013-12-05 01:50:00,6138,"Thank you, everybody, for your prayers and best wishes. It means a lot to both of us."
822243,Handlebarz,2013-12-05 02:53:00,3790,It's always nice to get some good news before Christmas. Glad to hear that things are in your favor.
822250,Christopheraaron,2013-12-05 03:06:00,3525,"Great news, have a merry Christmas now!"
895737,bigugli,2015-02-03 13:30:00,6138,"Well ,its been over a year since Judy finished chemo. In that time, there have been 2 more preventive surgeries. Now we have some new wrinkles. Back to the cancer clinic for day 2 of tests and consults."
895738,Big Cliff,2015-02-03 13:45:00,6899,Thinking of and saying a prayer for you and Judy my friend!
895771,lew,2015-02-03 17:20:00,12766,Best of luck for your wife Bruce.
801529,bigbuck,2013-08-03 10:35:00,2449,What Wayne said!! Do not leave until ALL of your questions and concerns have been addressed to your satisfaction. Don't be nasty to the doctor but be firm. Best of luck to you and your wife Bruce.
801540,Ralph Field,2013-08-03 13:00:00,1018,"There is nothing wrong with saying "" I'm having a hard time understanding what you're saying can I speak to someone else"". I do this with the calls for air duct cleaning all the time.LOL"
801543,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-03 13:12:00,4399,"I feel your pain we spent 9 hours at PMH yesterday for less than 5 minutes of face time with the doctor, now in our case there is little the doctor can tell us that I don't already know. All the doctor did was reiterate what I had researched already. I am quickly learning that the real stars are the support staff.  Good luck with your battle."
801545,spinnerbaitking,2013-08-03 13:20:00,1622,"Ditto on everything already said, you need to be comfortable with what they're saying & understand it, Positive thought be sent your way, Tight Lines SBK Sometimes this is what it feels like."
802517,bigugli,2013-08-10 07:21:00,6138,"A much better week for the Mrs.  Judy attended a women's workshop at the Wellness Center. Lots of info shared by staff,volunteers and survivors. Friday's visit to Juravinski was great. We had the staff physician's undivided attention, and he took the time to clearly answer the wife's questions and show us around the chemo suite. Next stop, North Bay, to relax,...  and buy a few pink boat tickets. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=70799  Looks like next week will be booked up with tests."
802518,bigugli,2013-08-10 07:43:00,6138,"On another note, my aunt, down East, has been diagnosed with late stage cancers. Her options are extensive and aggressive chemo. or 30 days to get her affairs in order. It was a bit of a shock, and very upsetting for Judy, when we first heard. Amazing how we went from a family without a history of cancer, to 4 people with cancer in less than 5 years."
802537,Ralph Field,2013-08-10 12:53:00,1018,Hope all the tests go well !
803074,bigugli,2013-08-13 16:51:00,6138,"Well, it's test day. Got to Juravinski to find out they added 3 more hours to the day, plus a Chemo orientation class. Wife sent me home to look after our puppy dog.   I can go back and pick Judy up after 3"
804346,bigugli,2013-08-21 21:26:00,6138,"Well, Judy had her first day of chemo. So far so good. Just gonna keep my fingers crossed."
804347,irishfield,2013-08-21 21:28:00,26272,Gemcitabine?
804348,bigugli,2013-08-21 21:39:00,6138,Adriamycin  and Cyclophosphamide  for the first 4 months. Taxol for the second series
804351,bigugli,2013-08-21 21:43:00,6138,"On another note, in the chair beside my wife was a fellow angler I had not heard from in months. I was really taken aback."
804353,Roy,2013-08-21 21:49:00,13728," Yeah, that would surprise me too.  Maybe it's a good sign that a friend is around to share things with."
804361,RiverGuy,2013-08-21 22:52:00,19,Hopping for all the best for you and your family...My heart and prayers go out to you and your family
804370,bigbuck,2013-08-21 23:53:00,2449,Cyclophosphamide is not a lot of fun. i hope they gave her some anti nausea meds. No oranges or orange juice. They counteract the drug. I had 8 rounds of chemo with it in the cocktail. She wont feel well for a few days but will get her strength back fairly quick. She has to eat. Very very important. She may not want to but you have to make sure she eats so her body can fight. Good luck. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your wife. Be strong for her when she cant.
804373,irishfield,2013-08-22 00:27:00,26272,"Not familiar with those two Bruce.. amazingly enough though all this.. but when she gets to the Taxotere (or Docetaxel will probably be on the bag).... it will crash her white counts and she'll be given Neulasta or Neupogen needles to try to protect her immune system. Neulasta is $2814 a needle (for 0.6ml!)... so make sure in advance of getting to this stage that you find someone to help you find a program that will fund it to (hopefully at 100%) some extent for you. The Neupogen regime is usually 10 needles over 10 days.. somewhere around the $1200 mark. Bone ache is the downfall of at least the Neulasta. Warm baths seem to help Jen get through...  Another thing... no matter who / why or how much they want to visit. NOBODY comes in that house door that can't guarantee they are 100% healthy. I don't care if they are family or not. Nobody seems to take that seriously... until you've spent a couple of 4 day gigs back in the hospital with Febrile Neutrpenia. Then at least you will take it real serious... the people knocking at the door still think it's no big deal. We finally put a sign on ours... even with that people still find humour in it somehow ... ""I'll just keep my hands in my pockets"" doesn't cut it.  Hand sanitizer at your door entrance.... use it everytime 'till your hands have long dried out and cracked apart."
804419,bigugli,2013-08-22 07:30:00,6138,"We are covered for the neulasta with a drug plan.  It was one of the first things I was bugging the MD and pharmacist about.  As for visitors, we know the drill. We have far too many family members fighting different forms and stages of cancer right now.  Our daughter, the walking bug factory, is just going to have to accept the new restrictions."
804445,MJL,2013-08-22 13:45:00,2427,"As always, sending my best wishes   I guess they jacked up the price for Neupogen. It’s $2000 for 10 shots…And it makes your spine and pelvis hurt like hell"
804453,bpsbassman,2013-08-22 14:23:00,941,"Your wife and you are in my prayers Bruce. I also live in Grimsby and have been through what you're going through with my wife. Anytime you need someone to lean on, let me know."
804455,fishnsled,2013-08-22 14:29:00,3520,Best wishes coming your way Bruce.
806467,bigugli,2013-09-05 07:34:00,6138,"Chemo session #2 is done and so far so good. Judy has only had some mild nausea and the hair is just starting to fall out.  On the negative, my aunt down east has discontinued chemo. They give her a month or 2 without it, but the multiple sessions each week left her weak and bedridden in hospital. I can understand and respect her decision."
806829,icedude,2013-09-08 18:50:00,459,"Just reading this for the first time Bruce.  Stay strong dude--it's a horrible dance, i know from experience  Good vibes to you and your Lady --Every New Day !  Looks like you guys are receiving rock solid medical care here    Keep the Faith Bruce  Stay Positive. agree with fellow poster..............ask stacks of questions  Cheers  Paul"
808629,bigugli,2013-09-20 18:52:00,6138,"Third session in the books, and it has been a rough week. So far the nausea meds have been ineffective. Now we are looking at the possibility that the cancer is spreading. We top the week off with a meds reaction that hit the bride's kidneys. Spent all night in emerg with Judy in excruciating pain while they rule out all the possibilities."
808631,lew,2013-09-20 19:06:00,12766,Your wife is having a tough time  Bruce and I honestly wish I knew what to say other than to offer her all my best.
808634,MJL,2013-09-20 19:14:00,2427,"Hang in there Bruce.  I also had issues with nausea with the standard anti-nausea pills (ondansetron, dex & stemitil). Later I was given Emend (Aprepitant) and it worked very well during my high dose chemo sessions. It’s definitely something worth talking about to the pharmacist and oncologist. Nausea sucks especially when all you’re trying to afterwards is hydrate.  Sending my prayers to you and the missus."

790925,bigugli,2013-06-06 21:11:00,6138,"The Mrs had her first session at Well Springs. A Niagara support centre for cancer patients.  Very helpful, informative and supportive people"

793202,bigbuck,2013-06-18 00:49:00,2449,Good luck to the two of you tomorrow. I start my maintenance treatments tomorrow and am not looking forward to being wired up like an xmas tree for 8 hours.

793288,bigugli,2013-06-18 11:30:00,6138,"I have ever refused to see cancer as some unbeatable evil. It's just another obstacle to overcome. As for Judy, I don't think she is that strong right now. I won't tell her about Jen til later."
793291,bigcreekdad,2013-06-18 11:59:00,546,"Your family has way more than a fair share of bad luck. My wife had a cancer scare a few months ago that turned out not to be cancer....I know what the ""waiting to know"" thing is.  Hang in there....there are many, many cancer survivors out there. I'll be saying a prayer your wife joins those ranks."

793380,bigugli,2013-06-19 00:20:00,6138,So far so good. Judy's in good spirits after the operation. Now we wait on the pathologist.

Cherish the moments you have and look with bright eyes towards the future because noones book has been written."
796309,bigugli,2013-07-03 19:35:00,6138,"Today was the follow up with the surgeon.  The wife is healing pretty well so far for 2 weeks post-op. They removed all the cancerous material in the breast, but the mass was larger than first anticipated. The bad news is that the cancer is an aggressive, fast growing strain and is at stage 3.  Next step the oncology dept at the Juravinski Cancer hospital for further treatment options."
796316,lew,2013-07-03 20:03:00,12766,Keeping my fingers crossed for you guys Bruce.
796346,bigbuck,2013-07-03 22:45:00,2449,Juravinski has a good reputation. Hang in there Bruce. Some chemo and or radiation and she will be ok. Be strong for her when she can't. Keep us posted.

796744,Rattletrap2,2013-07-06 02:39:00,1652,Just seeing all this now Bruce. Sorry to hear and wishing you and your Wife all the very best for a speedy recovery.
801497,bigugli,2013-08-02 23:40:00,6138,"Well, today was the big first visit at the cancer clinic.  A lot of information to go through from a resident who barely has command of the English language. (the staffman only had time to stick his head in and say hello)  The Mrs walked out of there at the end of the day totally confused and overwhelmed. Lots of statistics and data, not a lot of clear answers, and a number of questions avoided. Heck, I used to work in hospital admin, and am used to medical mumble, and I had a hard time following what the resident was trying to say. Definitely not a good start for the Mrs."
801498,irishfield,2013-08-02 23:47:00,26272,"Ask questions Bruce and tell him you can wait in the room 'till he comes back with the answers. Remember... you're the customer. Sounds odd, but you are. The resident / fellow's boss is there somewhere, probably just seeing another patient. We've been there.. done that similar to your today.. but after 3 years of this we don't leave unless we know what we came in for, although there are indeed some questions we never ask as with some things knowing isn't the best avenue to take."
801501,bigugli,2013-08-03 00:05:00,6138,Next week's visit will have a different tone to it. Starting with medical staff with a clear command of the English language.
801502,irishfield,2013-08-03 00:09:00,26272,Well good luck with that one... but I've learned to listen in a whole different way and have no issue asking them to slow their speech down a tad or even write it down for me!
801504,asdve23rveavwa,2013-08-03 00:25:00,2690,"All the best, and, listen to Wayne's advice.  Someday, hopefully soon, we will kick cancer's butt!!!"
788253,bigugli,2013-05-24 00:24:00,6138,"Brother in law is stable, and they've shrunk his tumors as far as they can. That new drug they were touting a couple of months ago near killed him.  Now we wait and see. The neice, with clean bill of health after removal of lymphoma 4 years back, is now preggers.  WooHoo! The Mrs has now been diagnosed with cancer and will see the surgeon next week. Waiting for the biopsy results was tough enough for Judy. On top of all her other health issues, this is not gonna be good.  At least I have a few shining rays of hope to point to here on OFC."
