899233,wormdunker,2015-02-20 13:33:00,1711,I always make sure my pliers are out of my tackle bag & within reach.  Many times I've been trolling for walleye & forgot to get my pliers out - no fish.  Then I remember the pliers - get them out.  You know the ending!  FISH ON!
899237,glenner,2015-02-20 14:00:00,56,"Catching a fish on the first cast is a bad omen..  Always screws up the rest of my day (Unless I'm steelheading) Ha, I agree with this, BillM. I always say it's like when you're golfing and you smoke your first drive right down the middle - rest of the round will be a disaster!"
899244,MrSimon,2015-02-20 14:40:00,217,I have a lucky lure that has caught me more fish over the years than everything else combined.  It's 'retired' now ... I couldn't stand losing it.  But it is always in my tackle bag ... in a jewelry box like a wedding ring would come in.  I feel naked if the boat if that lure isn't with me.  I have a feeling that one day the fishing will be so horrible that I'm driven to tie it on ..... and it will catch the biggest fish of my life.

Thats why i always hit the practise green for 15 minutes before a round. A few chips and flops, some puts. Easily saves 5-8 shots off each round  I still suck at golf though. I average about 92 lol.

The only thing worse than christening an empty net is if some idiot has a banana with 100yds of me while fishing. People have walked home when I am driving and they pull out the yellow kiss of death for success on a fishing trip LOL.

Two that I got from my father and have always observed - not strictly for fishing, just all purpose superstitions -  don't put new shoes on a table and never throw your hat on a bed. Have no idea the origin or rationale for these, but I have found myself following them without even realizing it sometimes."

My favorite catch by far.  Its hot as hell and im shore fishing bass. Doing well too.  I look to my right and there is this shallow sand area. I think I bet a big pike is sunning right there. I put on a jig head and a berkely ripple shad.  One cast, its like i casted directly into his mouth. As soon as the bait hit the water i set the hook.  That fish took 5 or 6 good runs and I was kinda in shock. Only muskies ive caught here are in the 20-24"" range but i though for sure it was a musky.  I had to get in the water to land it and I was sketched right out. Handling a fish like that solo, in the water is gnarly.  I gotter unhooked without harm. Held her up in awe. What a beauty!  Took a minute or so to get her to swim off but she did.  That, to this date, is my most memorable catch"
