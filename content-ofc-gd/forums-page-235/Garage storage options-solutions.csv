I'm too useless to make my own so I ponied up and dont regret it."

854526,35Wailin,2014-05-21 13:14:00,59,"I lucked out when I built my shed last year.  My local CTC store was closing one of their warehouses and was selling the shelving for a pretty good price.  I got warehouse grade shelving for less than the cost of the cheap crap they sell for home use.  Bottom line, DON'T buy the flimsy, consumer grade canning shelves, etc. that are made of thin guage sheet metal or even plastic resin.  They won't last, They WILL collapse at some point and you will have to spend more money to replace with better quality shelving anyway.  Spend the money now and save the aggravation later."

I also built a huge loft at the back of the garage - full width and around 8' deep. It's just high enough that the boat can tuck under it. I even use the space between the 2x10's to store fishing rods, ladders etc. Let me know if you would like to see pics.  Pete"

A little flimsy without any weight on them. I was going to bolt them together and screw to the wall or use in the shed. Unfortunately, I have no space left in either the garage or the shed for any more shelving. Sorry. Blurry pic with my crappy phone camera. Tools not included. Ooops. Looks like the pic didnt work the first time. Here ya go. "

855048,kickingfrog,2014-05-25 00:31:00,8333,I may use 4x4's but I figured I'd take a look at what people have done themselves.
855049,dhickey,2014-05-25 00:35:00,1038,Sounds like you might need a cabinetmaker/finish carpenter ?  Gee I wonder where you could find one close to you?  Don.   Go chicago
