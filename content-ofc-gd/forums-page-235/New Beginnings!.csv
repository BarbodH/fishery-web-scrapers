855624,landry,2014-05-28 16:11:00,1005,I did the exact same thing to a 90 14' sea nymph about 12 years ago. It was fun and I loved the boat. I love boat mod or refurb threads. Nice work. There is a great used minn kota on the lake simcoe board right now I believe. 150 obo and it looks perfect for your boat. There is also a really well priced lowrance elite 5 listed there too. Landry

855665,davey buoy,2014-05-28 21:07:00,5505,Job well done for someone just winging it!!!!Looks great!
855668,fishindude,2014-05-28 21:35:00,220,"Looks great Robs! I hope to have a similar setup of my own one day, can't beat it bang for buck  How do you find the stability with two people on the casting deck with the raised Centre of Gravity? Is it more tippy than you expected?  Great job guys"
855676,Steve,2014-05-28 22:56:00,2075,"flat bottom with raised decks...careful having both of ya standing on the bow....  a good hookset from one of ya would send the other flying....  i guess that means, you be the one setting the hooks, lol.  great stuff!"
855704,Bassassins,2014-05-29 01:41:00,111,Things I was a little worried about but we have been on the water twice with it now and it really isn't bad at all.  You do need to be smart about moves you do make and for the picture we were both on the front (to try it out and for the shot) but we find ourselves usually one at the back running the trolling motor on or off the back bench (I was surprised how wide the back bench is and with the carpet its very safe) and the other spending most time running around the front.  Like any boat or standing in a canoe or other things like that it is important to be smart about sudden movements but we aren't complaining.
855716,gino,2014-05-29 02:19:00,400,Dude! that looks awesome!!!!  now you have to get us some more of those awesome pictures..   Enjoy your boat!
855728,aplumma,2014-05-29 11:10:00,6896,well done looking good. A trick I learned from a counter top fabricator is instead of drywall use cardboard and tape to make the template. use a big piece for the main body then cut strips by placing them next to the edge and use a compass to trace the edge onto the loose piece of cardboard. Cut it out and then slide it to the edge and tape it onto place. You will have the perfect template for any shape you are covering in any product.   Art
