My dad and uncle used to talk about spearing them in the spring and grandma would put them up in canning jars , pickled I beleive. That would be 75 years ago though. Be careful , I know the spring regs on spearing and dip netting coarse fish have changed over the years. Spearing pike was a spring ritual for my generation and has passed by the wayside now Also , watch out for bears they hit up the sucker creeks pretty good for the run too."

Thanks Dave, I checked the regs over before we left for the FMZ we were in, if ya have a licence you are good to go in that creek for suckers, not a sanctuary. Spearing  jackfish would be a no go as would capturing smelt. As for bears…yeah, in the area I live in always a risk whether picking blueberries or netting suckers or walking the dog or shore fishing or going to the dump. Right after that we went to visit a friend camping out down a logging road, saw 6 bears in all. thankfully we were in the truck as it was momma and baby bears, heard mums get a little testy in that situation!"

The older guy kept a couple for trout bait and some for a lady who 'cans' them. He says it tastes just like canned salmon…whod've thunk it eh?"
