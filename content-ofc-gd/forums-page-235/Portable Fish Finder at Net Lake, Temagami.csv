This year we are heading up to Andorra Lodge on Net Lake, Temagami in mid June. My old fish finder is on the fritz so i'm in the market for a very simple portable fish finder that is ideal to use on a 9.9hp rental boat. Would love your suggestion on a model.  Also, if anyone has fished in the area, any helpful suggestions would be appreciated especially trolling for walleye using my new fish finder!!!! LOL!  Thanks in advance,  ""DR"" Dave"
854805,Nipfisher,2014-05-23 02:54:00,2449,"Piranha Max from Canadian Tire is about the cheapest depth finder you can get. Works but no ""bells and whistles""."
854808,adempsey,2014-05-23 03:19:00,1498,"I am actually looking around myself for an inexpensive model.  Going the used route.   I think the Humminbird Piranhamax series are a good choice for units around $125 and less.    They draw low power, which is great if you want to use AA batteries instead of the larger SLA's.   Other inexpensive alternatives are the Lowrance X-4 and X-4 Pro; and the Garmin Echo series.  Not too sure about the Garmins, but the X-4 seems alright and it seems popular with the Kayak guys..  Check Radioworld, they have reasonable prices and a decent selection.  BTW you can make any sonar portable."
854815,Joeytier,2014-05-23 03:42:00,3990,"The Pirahnamax is a really poor unit, but i suppose the price is right.  The lowrance x-4 is really reasonably priced and works very well."
854816,Joeytier,2014-05-23 03:48:00,3990,"I'll be doing an overnighter on a back lake close to Net this weekend so I can let you know what to expect as far as water temps and levels etc.  Generally the lakes right next to the road (like Net) are a tough go, especially during daytime hours, but Mid-June is pretty well prime time so do your blackfly voodoo and capitalize on low light hours (or even after dark)"
854827,Fisherpete,2014-05-23 10:33:00,1814,"I have a Humminbird 718 - much better unit that those Piranhamax etc - in near new condition that I could part with, could put together a package for you if you were interested. Can rig up the transducer for you to be portable too.  Send me a pm.  Pete"
854883,adempsey,2014-05-23 17:35:00,1498,"The nice thing about the Piranhamax units is most of them only draw 100mA, so your battery really lasts [some of the older ones draw <25mA].   So that makes switching to AA battery packs much more feasible.   Sure, they are basic, but the only units I've seen that actually ""find fish"" are the high end units [unless you're in water over 40 feet deep], but maybe it's just me.  I looked around a bit today and saw the Lowrance X-4 Pro on clearance at Canadian Tire for $98.  Walmart had the Garmin Echo 150 on clearance for $88.    Walmart also had the Piranhamax 143 for $78 and the Piranhamax 165 portable for $149, which isn't too bad.   No clue if those prices are at all locations.  The X-4 Pro draws 170mA of current without the backlight on, while the Echo 150 supposedly draws 600mA - according to Garmin support.     The Garmin draw seems way too high to me for a black and white unit, but it's hard to find any reputable info about that online.   So, without testing it, I would be apprehensive about using that unit as a portable unit.   I may buy one and test it though.  For comparison, my Humminbird 565PT draws 200mA [although, in practice it looks like it draws closer to 150-160mA]  and runs for 12 hours off of 8 Duracell NiMH AA batteries, 14 hours off of 8 Duracell Alkaline AA batteries, ~45 hours off of a 12V 7Ah SLA battery and 90 hours off 8 Duracell Alkaline D-cells."
854963,dave1965,2014-05-24 02:44:00,41,"Thanks fellas for all this ample information. I have an old Hummingbird that used 2 large 6? volt batteries. I was hoping to get one that uses one big  rechargeable battery.  Joeytier, would love to hear your report!"
855235,BillsTheBassMan,2014-05-26 17:55:00,932,"Kijiji is typically loaded with old fishfinders.  I have bought 3 in the last month for a total of $75.  They all work, 2 are new.  One of them is an alkalined powered piranhamax and it would be my recommendation for a rental boat.  I use it on my outcast pac 1200 and it does more than id want it to.  4 8 hour days on cheap home depot AA batteries and still going strong."
855255,mattybculp,2014-05-26 19:30:00,388,"I have a humminbird 570 portable, I don't use it very much anymore, but it does come in  handy when travelling back lakes or moving from boat to boat. Suction cup transducer can be a little bit of a pain in the arse sometimes but its one large battery and comes in its own little case, I think they sell em at CT now I paid a lot more for mine a few years back. It may be worth looking at. I think I paid like $375 for mine but I think they are a lot more reasonable now."
