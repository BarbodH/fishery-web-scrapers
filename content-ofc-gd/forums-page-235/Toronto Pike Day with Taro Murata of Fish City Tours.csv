Taro was an excellent host - he warned us the day before the trip that the recent cold snap could completely turn off the bite and even offered to reschedule. As it was very difficult for the three guys in my party to coordinate a date, we took to the water hoping for a bit of luck.  It was pretty cold on the water, but Taro soon had us in an area that was producing bites, follows and fish. We ended up boating 10 fish and just missing several others.  As Toronto residents, it was cool to have such easy access to a productive day on the water. Loved being able to see the city in the background as we cast our lines.  None of the fish were monsters, but we were very happy with the action and the numbers considering Taro's less than optimistic prediction for the day. I'd highly recommend his services. Especially if you're looking to discuss golden era hip-hop and the culinary merits of fiddleheads and miso soup between fish.    http://fishcity.tv/  "

854664,Mike Pike,2014-05-22 12:28:00,1332,I think it's great that someone is offering a guide service in the heart of the city.  So convenient when you only have a few hours but still want to get on a boat and get into some good fishing.  Glad you enjoyed your day.
