855243,BillM,2014-05-26 18:57:00,17367,What do you need help with?  Installing a fish finder isn't very hard.   I'm sure we could help you out.
855245,aznphil,2014-05-26 19:03:00,73,I don't have access to the necessary tools to put a hole in the boat and don't trust myself doing it.  Can anyone suggest some shops I can call up and get a quick quote from?

855247,davey buoy,2014-05-26 19:06:00,5505,Where are you located?
855248,fishnsled,2014-05-26 19:11:00,3520,There certainly are enough knowledgeable people here to help you and possible someone in your area to pop by for extra help if needed.  Keep a few bucks in your pocket for gas.     They are very easy to install.
855249,aznphil,2014-05-26 19:17:00,73,thanks all for putting me in the right direction.  I knew I posted on the right forum =)
855250,davey buoy,2014-05-26 19:23:00,5505,thanks all for putting me in the right direction.  I knew I posted on the right forum =) Now the details!  .Maybe picture?
855251,bushart,2014-05-26 19:23:00,2628,I'm not sure how many items you'll be putting on your tinny---one thing to consider is getting a hold of a teflon piece (Likely find at marinas  Screw that to your boat and then that gives you a few options to screw to without punching holes in your boat each time---nice if you want to add speed and temp down the road.  remember stainless screws---don't put transducer right behind turbulence---like keels or line of rivets
855253,BillM,2014-05-26 19:28:00,17367,I hope he has a graph with both speed and temp
855259,bushart,2014-05-26 19:55:00,2628,AAaaaaah'''Ya don't need speed and temp ta catch fish   Ok well maybe
855302,porkpie,2014-05-26 22:22:00,2521,"Just take some 3M 5200 and cut up a dollar shop cutting board.  Glue the piece of cutting board to the rear of the boat.  My old lund has had that exact setup for over 10 years now, no screws required!  Then screw your transducer to the cutting board."
