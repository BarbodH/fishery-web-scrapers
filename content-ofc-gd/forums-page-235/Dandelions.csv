854986,Beans,2014-05-24 13:59:00,3339,Too bad the damn mole infestation I had over the winter didn't eat the dandelion roots...  I read that if I get rid of the grubs then the moles will move on...  Haven't seen any skunk or coon diggings yet so maybe the moles got all the grubs...  Sure was a surprise to see all the trenches after the snow melted...  Oh the joys of country living !!!

Grandpa used to make a batch every year. I'm not exactly a fan of wine, but the dandelion wine he made tasted better than many store bought wines.  The best ways to get revenge:  -make wine with the flowers -use the leaves in salads (very high vitamin A and K, decent dose of vitamin C, calcium, iron) -pull out the roots and make a very healthy tea"

I am so making this wine but I think this year is out as I'm not 100% prepared and most of the dandelions are past there prime and white now. Gonna talk to our wine making people and see if they have any tips. I'm hoping next year it will become a Bobcaygeon spring ritual and you and Sue would certainly be welcome to join in.
855185,Maverick,2014-05-26 02:57:00,371,"2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or 2, 4-D is what you want. It's what was in all the herbicides that kill broadleaf plants. Not for use in Ontario or Quebec for lawn and garden applications. You either need to know a farmer or go state side. I have a personal vendetta against dandelions but now live on the water and have a baby in the house so 2, 4-D is out of the question. Heavily seed is my only option."

Just saying....this is a fishing forum and everyone is giving advice on how it use/'import' this crap....and then folks will turn around and whoo and haaa about why the fishing sucks...everywhere.  It might not kill the fish directly, but it'll either kill what they eat, or what they eat eats.  If you want a shnazzy lawn,  maybe consider that you'll have to put some work into keeping it nicely groomed.  Otheriwse, dig up your friggin lawn and grow a bunch of stuff you can eat beside your catch."

I have stopped and bought a 1 gallon jug of scotts weed killer, and it had ok results, but at 40 bucks for a gallon and having a sizeable lawn I'm not made of money.lol. so I read online and watched some youtube videos about people using a vinegar, dish soap, salt or citrus solution. Im just curious as to what you guys use and your results. I hate cutting my lawn and it looks great and the next morning I wake up saying ""are you kidding me there back already."" Is it true you can buy ""industrial"" (laugh) strength weed killer in quebec ? or is that a pipe dream. Thanks everyone!"

854881,pairofgreenhorns,2014-05-23 17:25:00,133,"Over seeding is great, but tall grass is the trick because it stops sunlight from getting to the soil to allow new weeds to grow. Every spring i  spray the weeds with some stuff i get in the states (not legal in canada) cant think of the name off the top of my head but pm me if your interested and when i get home ill let you know, i leave the spray on the weeds for a cpl days then i  i fertilize and grass seed (if there are bare spots i rake them first) and then water the whole yard immediately after. my parents live on an acre and they do this every year and their grass is a thing of beauty.

854894,'Kota'sDad,2014-05-23 19:10:00,7,"I use Ortho's Weed-B-Gon and it is very effective. Will not harm the grass but gets weeds other than dandelions, too. It costs me about $14/gallon, but I have no idea what it is up your way. As others mentioned, thick, tall grass is key. I mow high compared to most folks, but it discourages the weeds and looks quite lush.  Every day I go out to spray those two or three dandelions that have sprout their pretty posey, I ask myself if it's worth it since some of the neightbors have thos yellow carpets around their houses?!??!"
854896,adempsey,2014-05-23 19:21:00,1498,"I keep overseeding but the results have not been impressive.   It's most likely due to the amount of shade or not watering enough, but I wanted to try different grass seed this year.    Any suggestions?  I've used several types of Scotts and CIL.  Was thinking about using Pickseed.  The banned herbicides likely contain three compounds - 2-4D, MCPA and likely Dicamba (product names - Trimec Turf Herbicide, Trimec Bentgrass Formula, Triplet Selective, Triplet Hi-D, Triplet SF, Three-Way Selective, Bentgrass Selective, Ortho Weed B Gon, Spectracide, Weed Stop, Bayer Advanced Weed Killer for Lawns).   There are plenty of different combinations, including those with  MCPP and Triclopyr as well.  I've been lucky with the dandelions myself, but creeping charlie is a whole other story.  Over the past two years it's taken over half my lawn!!!!!      Might have to just destroy it with a broad spectrum compound and reseed.  Not sure what else to do about it."

854902,lew,2014-05-23 19:48:00,12766,Two years ago I started getting alot of bare patches in a section of the backyard and after digging around I found it was grubs causing the problem. I dug out all the grass and a ton of grubs then when it warmed up enough early last spring I gave it a heavy dose of nematoads then let it sit for a couple weeks.    I levelled everything and layed down 1000 sq feet of new sod.      Last fall I sprayed another treatment of nematoads and then again last week.  The lawn came in really nice and this year is looking excellent and here you can see the new lawn adjacent to the older part of the lawn.  Lotsa work but well worth the effort.

854956,JimC,2014-05-24 01:58:00,86,"Awesome thread everyone ... thanks for the comments and tips.   It's a battle isn't it ... especially here in Ontario, where Federally approved substances, that can be safely used if directions followed, or a professional does the deed, are banned.    I've had good success by cutting the lawn regularly, but very high 4inches at least. Still,  last year the chinch bugs hit me, sucking the life out of the nice thick, green grass.   lots of bare spots, and not very happy.  Well its been a long long cold winter, and a very wet spring,  so not good for chinch bugs;  however,  the dandelions and thistles love it.   we've only had the odd dandelion before this year, which we've dug out by hand, and if on the edge of the driveway also spray household vinegar in the hole that remains to ensure it doesn't regenerate in that spot.   But his spring there's dozens every morning ... never ever had it like this.   We're doing our best to NOT use the Ortho Weed-B-Gone, or similar substance... legal most places but not in the we-know-whats-best-for-you world of our decade OLD provincial government.     I think a limited dandelion, creeping charlie, thistle, clover, etc etc CULL is long overdue.   Tried everything else, so what the heck... might as well go for it, right!  oh, and while I'm on the subject ... and being a Fishing related forum mostly,  howz about a decent CULL of those d*mmed, ugly, black walleye n perch vacuum cleaning Cormorants on Lake Nipissing.
