After wading through a couple hundred small pike I found some crappie, in about 1'FOW, just sunning themselves, but not shy enough to ignore a fat minnow under a slip bobber, great fun sight fishing crappie. Got a nice walleye and an 18"" smallie too.Sight fishing for crappie                  "

Actually I prefer perch, bluegills crappie and small pike over walleye. We have a cottage in the kawartha's and I haven't harvested a walleye in over 10 years up there.  Looks like a good day Simon  Thx for sharing it with us."
