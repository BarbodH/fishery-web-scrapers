Knowing between Pike opener & Bass opener we were going to be limited for dates, I was trying desperately to find a date from mid April to 3rd Sat in May. Weather (miserable) & weekend commitments were proving daunting. We eventually found some mutual time & settled on last Saturday (May24th). Met Pete at the launch @ precisely 6:30 am (as agreed) on the finest Saturday fishing day so far this soft water season. As an added bonus, Pete brought along tournament partner LunkerHunter and his bigger boat. We were on the first spot by 7:00.  20/25 minutes & a baby channel cat, it was time for location # 2. Another brief stop  produced only chewed up bait & nothing committing.  Time to move..... We hit spot 3 I'm guessing by 8:45ish and never moved. Pete & Andy found the Honey Hole . Over the next 4 hours (we pulled anchors @ 1:00 pm) we boated an additional 24 channel cats, 1 carp & a couple sheepshead. A few cats came in less than 4 lbs, most 5-8 & I think 4or 5 were in double digits. Can't remember the biggest fish as my SIL landed the top two weight wise (in a 3rd period comeback) LOL. Pete & Andy were awesome guides. I suggested if we hit double digits, the guiding was over but these guys kept handing the rods over!!! Without a doubt, this trip was a milestone . We've never boated 25 game fish (not counting the Sheepshead) in 4 hours!!!  Y'all got to keep an eye out for the next Tyler auction. This is worth it!!!!  So a few pix......             Can't thank Pete & Andy enough. This trip is going to be tough to beat"

855366,davey buoy,2014-05-27 10:25:00,5505,Nice catch guys!!!!
855401,JerMac,2014-05-27 15:45:00,37,Sweet cats. Looks like a blast! I'll have to get off my lazy arse and get out there.
855403,Tim Mills,2014-05-27 16:08:00,476,Excellent report. I've never fished for cats it looks like fun.
855457,misfish,2014-05-27 20:00:00,29133, Better then the guiding I did at the Tyler event Simon.   LOL  Great day and report bud.  Lots of great people on this board.
855494,Acountdeleted,2014-05-27 23:28:00,2562,Man! Looks like you had a blast. Pete knows his stuff for sure. Glad you had a great time.
855545,Fisherpete,2014-05-28 01:51:00,1814,"Thanks for all the kind words guys - it was a great day fishing with 3 great guys. Only hard part was waking up at 3:15am!  Simon & Troy - thanks again for your generous donation to Tyler's Auction. You guys were awesome to fish with, and I'm pumped that the fishing was as good as it was - that was an incredible run! My previous boat record was 23 cats for a day - and we beat that in 4 hours! Troy's biggest cat was just under 16 pounds, and there was a half dozen in the 12-13 range. You guys were good luck - things really slowed down literally right after you left! We only picked up one more big cat and three more sheepshead in the next 4 hours and then called it a day. Thanks as well for bringing the BBQ munchies - was a nice treat!  Andrew - thanks a bunch for volunteering your boat for the trip. The extra room made it comfy for the 4 of us. A&P Guiding Inc. is off to a very successful start - the bar has been set pretty high LOL!  Jeremy - thanks - but this day was all Andrew - including the hotspot!  I'll add a few more pics when I get a second to upload them.  Pete"

This year has been are they there, are they gone, yet to arrive? Looks like there in. With the water so high, fast and with deadheads flying down the cold muddy water just below the surface we have been reluctant to go across it. A friend of a friend put a nice hole in his glass boat last week when he hit an invisible something between Fishmasters and the dam. Just be careful everyone, lots of cats for everyone."
