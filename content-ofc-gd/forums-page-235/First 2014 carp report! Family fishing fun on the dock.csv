855654,Fisherpete,2014-05-28 20:31:00,1814,"After running around finishing my honey-do-list in the morning, I made the short run to to the cottage last Sunday afternoon with the wife and two boys, just to have some fun on the dock and a BBQ. We got there around 1:30pm, and started fishing by 2. Tyler (little man) had a blast fishing with worms and a float, and caught well over 100 sunfish, perch, rock bass and even a largemouth. Nick, Cheryl and I set up for carp... and it didn't take long to get into them. Overall, we went 11 for 12, the one I lost was a tank and snapped my 20lb floro leader on a blistering run! Anyways, we had four amazing hours of fishing... here's some pics of our fun!  p.s. the triple header was amazing... close to fifty pounds of carp in the net! It cost me a reel though, got broken in the chaos... however the good people at Normark/Rapala took care of me  and all is well.  p.p.s.s. Added 32.5"" inches for team 5 for the OFC tourney... had to play with the contrast etc. to make the sign visible LOL... hoping to upgrade anyways this weekend and not have to use the ugly pic.

855661,davey buoy,2014-05-28 20:45:00,5505,"Great family fun Pete,awesome pictures!!!!!!!!"
855670,Fisherpete,2014-05-28 21:45:00,1814,"Greg, on the May 24 weekend there was zero weed growth and not a single carp to be seen where my cottage is - a week later and they were stacked in there. Water has warmed almost 10F! This weekend should be fun..."
855684,alphaalpha,2014-05-28 23:24:00,475,Awesome shooting bud! Glad I don't have to try for carp this year as I've never done it before .  Also my oldest (3) has the same shirt as your young one there.  He is starting to make me think of taking it back these days tho lol.  Cheers  -Adam.
855708,Joey,2014-05-29 01:49:00,9122,Great report Pete!
855714,gino,2014-05-29 02:16:00,400,"hey Pete, that was an awesome day on the dock...good job on getting those big carp, they put a heck of  a fight"
855748,BowSlayer101,2014-05-29 13:44:00,296,"sweet fish! Theres a bunch around here and some have finished spawning but hits are very rare for me, most of the time they don't even look at the bait, mind sharing what you were using?, I've tried, corn and dough so far, thanks."
855750,Fisherpete,2014-05-29 13:53:00,1814,"Corn is all I use... Chum a small area with half a can, cast near the edge. First bite usually takes a while until they find your chum, but then they call their friends to the corn party and game on!!!  I use the same setup as I do for catfishing - weight-bead-swivel-18"" floro leader-small circle or carp hook. I put the rods in the holders, loosen the drag a bit and chill out until the drag starts screaming.  I'm going to experiment with boilies this weekend, never tried them before. Like the fact that they float of bottom - keeps the bait outta the muck.  Pete"
855751,BowSlayer101,2014-05-29 13:57:00,296,"ok, thanks, i was mainly using pickerel rigs for them, to keep the bait a bit off bottom, will try your setup, maybe wait a week or two for them to fully finish spawning around here, they don't wanna hit, last year it was non-stop, probably because they're not fully done spawning but its weird because I've already seen little tiny carp minnows swimming around."
855752,BillM,2014-05-29 14:19:00,17367,Nice carp!  I found a spot a few weeks ago fishing for crappies that probably had 200 carp in it... Giants as well...  Was a pretty cool sight.
855753,LefroyFisherman,2014-05-29 14:20:00,602,"Nice job Fisherpete! I caught a bunch of pike last weekend but none were all that big, I will for sure get a good one soon."
