Home inspection is Mar 20th and if all goes well (and it should; house is only 12 years old and looks mint) then April 25th we will be living at the North end of Barrie close to Georgian mall. I had a couple questions as I know some of you currently reside there.  First, does anyone live in this neighborhood? It would be great to meet with some local OFC'ers! We love hockey, fishing, eating nice dinners, drinking, photography, bowling, and playing games (board, trivia, any games really), are in our late 20's and don't have any children yet.  We are moving up there (from Toronto) because we love the outdoors, especially fishing, so we plan to buy a boat, what size and hp would be recommended for Simcoe?  Are there any big box stores in the north for home improvements it seemed from a short search on google earth that they are mainly south.  Lastly I have been working in downtown Toronto but because of the move I decided to take a job in Markham as it is at least a little farther north, what should I expect time wise for the commute, my hours are a little different; start at 10am or 10:30, done by 7 or 8pm.  Thanks for any insight or advice you all can offer.  Best, Pair of green horns!!! Hey Greenhorns,  Welcome to Barrie neighbour, I use to live in Orillia for over 18 years but recently moved to Angus. I do a lot of competitive fishing and work at Legend Boats. My days off are usually Wednesday and I spend a lot of time on the water. If your bored and wanna hit the water. Shoot me a PM and maybe we can get on the water.  Cheers"

Learning the back streets of whatever side of Bayfield your on is key to getting around quick.  Bayfield can get pretty jammed up by 6pm as everyone flocks to shop the mall & walmart.  PS I'm 30, married, father of 2 and a work from home hermit"

It doesn't matter what time you're out there, always traffic.  The difference in traffic from just 2007 to 2011 in the south end is remarkable.  As more big box stores got added and more communities were built the traffic exploded in such a short timeframe that we lived there.  Mapleview's 3 lane wide street in each direction (as wide as 5 in some intersections) with no other cross streets through 400 makes it crazy.  North end is certainly not limited by Bayfield, there are so many other routes to get around.  EDIT: Also yes the street layout is absolutely retarded in Barrie lol"

Thanks again for your replies guys/gals Welcome to Barrie as well!  I have had the pleasure of living here for the last 15 years and the mixture of affordable housing, being on the door of cottage country, and Lake Simcoe were all reasons that brought me here then.  I too commute south (Newmarket) but that being said, I always commute via highway 11 and even during the weekends, do not find it too bad (we'll sometimes through Bradford).  The budget you have set for a boat is very generous and I do not think you will have any issues finding something.  I have a 16' Starcraft with a full windshield and a 50hp 4 stroke on the back.  It has been a great boat, but sometimes a little small for Simcoe.  I find Simcoe can pick up really fast, and when she gets a northwest wind....look out!  Any of the boats you mentioned are good boats.  Personally, I would avoid  a Legend. I hav never owned one, but the 3 people I know that did, never did like them.  I would recommend a 18' with at least a 90hp on the back.  If you plan on doing a lot of trolling, a 4 stroke is nice and quiet as well.  That being said, my buddy owns an etec, and it's not too far behind.  You mentioned a tiller, any reason why?  Being a resident of Barrie, you will be able to lunch from 2 different areas for free.  Both are downtown.  The weekends are crazy at the launches (especially Tiffin) so being an early bird will be to your advantage.  Moving in at the end of April is a great time for perch.  Head downtown and you'll see where fish for them. Trust me, you won't miss it!  Enjoy the move, feel free to drop me a PM if you have any questions..."
842379,davey buoy,2014-03-20 21:38:00,5505,"Lady Simcoe as mentioned can be brutal even on the nicest days.Things change real fast.If you will be heading from the city or tiffen launches to big/deep waters,be aware of the 8km ride back home heading west.Make sure you have a higher wall boat.Even with mine it can take 45 mins to come back when the wind picks up.10km max.The spray and constant hitting of the waves makes it impossible to speed up.No swells like Gbay and Lake O.Not trying to scare you,but you need to know.Mines a 19' Scorpion i/o V8,and you have to be real careful.Great fishing lake if the winds don't show up!!"
