855831,captpierre,2014-05-29 22:18:00,2521,"You're not trying to get lucky with your sister, are you?"
855835,dracokaos,2014-05-29 22:41:00,116,"I'm assuming your thinking about Lake Ontario?   If so theres a launch right across from the GO Station. Go south on Gordon St from Victoria. Its public, always in good shape. $10 to park with trailer.  I havent been out yet and have been looking at the other fishing boards and not alot of talk about Whitby.  If you do go out let us know how it goes.  Cheers and tight lines!"
