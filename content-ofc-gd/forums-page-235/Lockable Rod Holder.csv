855177,Matt Janes,2014-05-26 01:53:00,49,"I am looking for a vertical rod holder that locks. Not sure if one exists. We have a trailer in a campground and I store my boat at the communal docks. I would like to be able to keep my rods in the boat overnight instead of bringing them up to the trailer every night. Any one have any ideas?  Thanks,  Matt"
855183,NANUK,2014-05-26 02:49:00,797,Why vertical ?
855184,BillM,2014-05-26 02:56:00,17367,"If they are worth $$$$, bring them up to the trailer.  What are you going to do with the rod locker?  Leave it in the boat 24/7?"
855188,Matt Janes,2014-05-26 03:08:00,49,I'm looking for something like this:  http://www.stripersonline.com/products/rapala-lock-n-hold-rod-rack  I have something like this installed already but I thought there might be something out there that locks so the rods couldn't be removed.  Might just stick to knowing they are safe and sound for sure by taking them up to the trailer.

855201,Canuck2fan,2014-05-26 11:57:00,1444,I would definitely move the rods up to the trailer if you value them... Something like that they won't just steal the rods but will probably bring tools to take the holder too after they see it.
855212,Lape0019,2014-05-26 13:44:00,647,"Matt,  Just convince the other half that you need a bigger boat with a rod locker in the floor.  Problem solved and I know she probably won't be too hard to convince"
855214,Fang,2014-05-26 13:57:00,1330,"When I had a trailer out at Hay Bay, all sorts of stuff stolen out of boats all the time - no matter how much you try and lock it up.  Big problem with the type of rod holder you show is that they can still walk off with the reels. Only true safe way is if your boat had under deck storage and you can lock them.  I always pulled my boat out nightly and locked my stuff back up in the truck/trailer as our spot was way up in the back away from the docks"
855232,bare foot wader,2014-05-26 17:33:00,1354,"if you don't want them stolen, take them out of the boat...this applies to electronics, tackle, etc, anything you don't want stolen, locks only slow thieves down, not stop them"

A lock can be broken or cut, most of the marine electronic locks act as deterents. If someone really wants your stuff they'll probably find a way to get it. That being said, believe the best in people and do your best to protect your stuff, at the end of the day if you're really that worried, put it in your trailer."
855238,Matt Janes,2014-05-26 18:21:00,49,"Although a new boat with locker storage sounds tempting, I think I will stick to the sound (and free) advice everyone is giving and just continue to bring my stuff up to the trailer nightly.  Thanks Guys."
855240,Lape0019,2014-05-26 18:48:00,647,She got to you eh!!!  She sent me an earful too!
855241,grimsbylander,2014-05-26 18:52:00,3016,Why not do both? You could easily mount that rack you posted on a piece of plywood and use Velcro strapping through a couple holes to mount it in your boat. Add a cut out along the side for a handle and make transporting the rods to the trailer even easier.
855271,aplumma,2014-05-26 20:33:00,6896,I use rod socks to keep the rods from getting all tangled up as you carry them back up to the house.   Art
