I will get to the point, the house has what I believe to be a stainless chimney that was originally for an oil furnace. The house now has a natural gas furnace and with replacing the siding and such I'm going to be taking the stack down since its not needed. The stack is in great shape not a spot of rust or anything, Im just curious is to if it could be used for other types of heating or if its worth anything to anyone ( I know a lot of people don't heat there houses to much with oil anymore). I am by no means an expert heck it may not have even been for a an oil furnace , im just speculating as there is no evidence that there was ever a fire place where it enters the house as it is the laundry room where the furnace etc is located. if anyone has any input that would be great its about a 13-14 ft stack ."
846958,bushart,2014-04-10 15:10:00,2628,If it's specifically for oil----no is the answer for wood  Confirm what type of venting it is before using it for another fuel  Propane and gas are all pretty well direct vented thru the wall now a days---so wood is the only other fuel
846959,Sinker,2014-04-10 15:15:00,8692,"Post a pic.  If its insulated chimney pipe it could be worth a fair bit, and I might know a guy who wants it.  S."
846973,mattybculp,2014-04-10 15:49:00,388,"after doing some research online I would have to say I'm 95% sure its a insulated stainless chimney, and guessing I would say its in pretty decent shape. This is going  sound brutal but what do I click on to add a photo, I am computer "" slow"". I will take a pic and hopefully the wife can show me how to upload a picture on here as she did that for my avatar. LOL"
846974,bushart,2014-04-10 15:54:00,2628,Not all stainless chimneys are created equal---take a picture of the tag on the pipe
846980,mattybculp,2014-04-10 16:23:00,388,ok will do ! Thank you !
847042,Bill Shearer,2014-04-10 19:26:00,456,"As already stated, the tag will tell the tale. You will also want to measure the ID of the chimney. Different stoves take different sizes. Sounds like a wood burning chimney to me though. Thy are not cheap."
847158,John Bacon,2014-04-11 03:25:00,3277,Older gas furnaces required chimneys.  That may have been what it was for.
847179,mattybculp,2014-04-11 12:49:00,388,"I Was not able to find the ""tag"". Every time I Try to upload a pic it says the file is too large, despite it being taken with my iphone diameter would have to be like 10- 12 inches. Just trying to figure out how to post a pic here. Is there generally a specific location for the tag ie. at the bottom where it enters the house or perhaps at the top of the chimney. I couldn't  find any tags going up the 3 ft sections ."
847181,Ralph Field,2014-04-11 12:55:00,1018,My gas furnace uses a chimney.
847182,bushart,2014-04-11 12:56:00,2628,Matty---I think your file size is limited to 250 kb  I'm thinking this chimney may be an older model----should have tags  One word of caution-----it's usually preferable to get professional advice on these matters---A fishing website can help along---but I would caution using it as a sole info source  Especially when it comes to someone heating a bldg.---insurance companies love to refuse claims unless everything is crossed and dotted----and that includes new installations of equipment (chimney)  Look at the flags around something simple like a garage sale-----I've heard you may be liable for selling defective items that may cause injury  Not the same world out there
847184,bushart,2014-04-11 12:58:00,2628,Yes some gas appliances still can be found with chimneys or liners  Most are direct vented these days for efficiency
847185,mattybculp,2014-04-11 13:12:00,388,"Thanks Bushart for your insight, Im just removing it. So I don't want any liability if someone bought it off me. I would rather throw it out then get someone hurt of course. If it didn't appear to be in decent shape I would just toss it, I just thought maybe if someone had a bush or hunting camp maybe it would be of some value to someone. When I get it taken down I will take it in to a place and get there input .Any idea of how one can minimize or shrink the size of the picture ? thanks"
847189,bushart,2014-04-11 13:35:00,2628,"It ""May"" be in Good shape and still useful  One should just look into it all and be safe that's all  I use Microsoft picture manager and compress the pic till it's under 250  Like this...jus ta brighten yur day     "
847201,Sinker,2014-04-11 15:15:00,8692,"You can upload the pic to photobucket, and copy the IMG link at the bottom if the pic into your post. It will appear as a picture when you post it. Easiest wat to post pics.  S."
847225,fish_fishburn,2014-04-11 17:49:00,1311,Sounds like a Selkirk chimney to me. They are expensive. Keep all the hardware as well when you take it down. Take a piece to a furnace shop and ask them.
855278,mattybculp,2014-05-26 20:50:00,388,sorry my attempt to post a pic through photobucket did not go well. I will try again.
