More specifically, the small screw that holds the plastic cap on which keeps the handle nut from turning. I was hoping to have this reel available for the cottage this weekend and really don't have time to run out to Aikman's in Mississauga until next week.  Please let me know!  thanks Pete"
855691,dhickey,2014-05-29 00:28:00,1038,If I were you I would head to my local archery shop they will probably have every size and thread... The store in Oshawa comes to mind it might be worth a call? Just a thought..  Don.
855749,Fisherpete,2014-05-29 13:46:00,1814,"Good idea - thanks Don.  Another member pm'd me that the screws used for electrical boxes fit - you just have to cut them down to length.  Whatever I go with, it's getting Loc-tite..."
855754,OhioFisherman,2014-05-29 14:26:00,6623,"Watch the threads, an electrical box screw may not be metric, an Abu screw probably is."
855803,davey buoy,2014-05-29 19:50:00,5505,I find three threads in if it's binding or not.As Pete says if it goes in properly add a drip of removeable or permanent.Permanent it will be real hard to remove without heat.
855805,Fisherpete,2014-05-29 20:04:00,1814,Electrical box screw is a no-go... Just tried it.
855807,jimmer,2014-05-29 20:11:00,2730,I lost one before and just wired the retainer on until I was able to get a screw.
855872,Fisherpete,2014-05-30 02:20:00,1814,Found a suitable size at Home Depot (4-40) and added two tiny washers so I didn't have to cut it down. Added loctite to the threads... Ready to roll!
855878,mistaredone,2014-05-30 03:15:00,913,Good to know.  Ive lost two before and had to drive to Aikmans.  Vibration from trolling is the primary cause.
