855465,bandito,2014-05-27 20:28:00,16,"Hi all,  We're heading up to the French River next week and I usually bring leeches. My bait guy says he most likely won't have any and says not many places around do. According to him, a tough spring on those little suckers. I'm leaving Guelph and heading up the 400/69. Do any of you jedi know of any place to grab some? Cheers and thanks."
