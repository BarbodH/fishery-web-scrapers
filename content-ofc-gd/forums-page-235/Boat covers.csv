855018,AdamS,2014-05-24 19:42:00,161,Hey guys I might be picking up a boat but it will probably be stored outside for the first little bit so I'm wondering where I can get a decent boat cover as well as if there's anything I should look for/stay away from when buying one. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
