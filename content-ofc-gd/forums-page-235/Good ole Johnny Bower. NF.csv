855125,kickingfrog,2014-05-25 19:25:00,8333,My wife met him 10-12 years ago.    She's not even 5 foot 1.  She also did a corporate thing with Curtis Joseph at a Leaf's game a few years ago. Me??? Nothing.
855137,lew,2014-05-25 20:35:00,12766,Nice tribute to a nice guy !!  He was from the era when I used to be a hockey fan and what a great goalie he was.  Used to be terrifying though to see him facing those 100 mph pucks coming at him without a mask.

I can remember when Turk Broda's weight made the headlines in a Toronto newspaper...LOL
