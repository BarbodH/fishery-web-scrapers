855455,davey buoy,2014-05-27 19:56:00,5505,Doesn't take much to make a big difference.Curious to hear how that works out.
855458,lew,2014-05-27 20:02:00,12766,"From the way I'm seeing that picture I don't think that's your trim adjustment, that's just to set the angle for when your trailering.  You're looking for the adjustment shown in the pictures posted by bare foot wader."
855460,bassmaster4,2014-05-27 20:12:00,801,The only thing on my motor that looks anything like what i saw in that diagram was that pin with the three settings. When changing to any number I'm still able to put my motor up.
855463,ssminnow,2014-05-27 20:26:00,48,"This is from the Mercury website.   No. The 8 and 9.9 horsepower FourStrokes feature an integrated automatic ratcheting trim system that does not require a separate trim pin. Just tilt the outboard to the desired position and thatâ€™s it. When you want to return to the down position, just ratchet the outboard all the way up and allow it to return to the down position once again.  The Mercury 8 and 9.9 FourStroke outboards with manual trim have six trim positions that allow the user to select the best position simply by pushing down on the tiller or lifting the rear of the outboard up. The three positions marked on the side of the clamp bracket indicate the ""preset tuck"" position. By setting this feature in either 1, 2 or 3, the outboard can be set to return to this same position every time. For example, if your boat operates best in the second trim position, then set the ""preset tuck"" to 2, and the outboard will go to this position every time it is cycled through the trim positions. You do not need to remember to reposition the trim to 2 after tilting down."
855464,lew,2014-05-27 20:26:00,12766,"Take a look at image #1 that bare foot wader posted and you can see the adjustment holes on the bottom of the bracket that clamps to your transom. You need to pull the pin out and move the motor to a different hole then replace the pin. If that doesn't work, try another hole. You may need to try a couple places until you find the one that puts your boat on plane properly.  EDIT TO ADD  I posted before ssminnow and according to his link it appears your motor may be somewhat different to what I'm used to.  Sorry for any confusion"
855467,ssminnow,2014-05-27 20:41:00,48,"Okay, I think I'm onto something here I had this knob set at 3 the entire time.  After looking at this diagram it shows the settings for trim with each number. Is it likely this was my problem? I have it set now so I'll have to try but the motor looks the same angle wise at the back of the transom. Yes 3 would be the highest preset trim position.  You want to trim it down to the 2 or 1 position for the preset."

855491,Terry,2014-05-27 23:14:00,14456,"so they dont use pins any more but that is what most were talking about, glad you got it"
855515,farsider,2014-05-28 00:41:00,456,"It is worth it to add weight to the bow as well when solo.  Whenever I am solo with the 12 footer I bring a 5gal pail or two and slap on a Gamma lid, fill it with water and/or rocks after you launch.  Job done. Empty when done fishn'. http://www.leevalley.com/en/garden/page.aspx?p=10006&cat=2,2260,47776  Cheers, Mark"
855556,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-28 02:35:00,8243,"I'm surprised that 4 stroke only weighs 85 pounds, they look huge now. That's not the problem.  Is there anyway guys that that motor is tilting up on it's own when accelerating?  I'm confused about the pins, I read here the new Mercury 4 strokes don't have a pin. It has a pre lock system 1,2 or 3 that goes back to the same position set at, tilt it up and it will only go down to the pre set position 1,2 or 3.  It's great to see everyone help here, it's what I really like about OFC, C as in community with a capital C."
855578,Terry,2014-05-28 09:00:00,14456,"yeah no pins, he had the pre lock  set for 3 and it was too high..same thing only different...lol"
855620,dave524,2014-05-28 14:55:00,4508,This has been a problem for 50 plus years with small aluminum cartoppers. At one time they made tiller extensions so you could sit further forward.
855622,big guy,2014-05-28 15:30:00,414,"Those are your shallow water drive settings. I had an 8 hp Merc I bought in '95 that had the same settings. Once set, all you had to do was press down on the tiller handle when entering shallow water in order to trim the motor further. There were three positions the motor would click into by pressing down.  Btw, I also had a 12 footer and with the gas tank in the front, the boat planed nicely with just me in it."

855354,bassmaster4,2014-05-27 04:49:00,801,"Hey guys, I'm having an issue with my boat, I can't get it to plane out, especially by myself in the boat when I hit the throttle the bow just points straight up and the transom gets dangerously low to the water. With a buddy sitting at the very front of the boat it does better but still rides a little high. I'm fairly new to boating so I have no clue what my problem could be. The boat is a 12 foot aluminium weighs about 200 lbs with a 2012 merc 9.9 four stroke on it.  Anyone ever have this problem and if so what was the solution? Thanks in Advance"
855356,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-27 06:19:00,8243,"Hey Bassmaster,  Is this a new to you boat? Has this done this before? For a small tinny with a 9.9 it's not uncommon. There really isn't much of any controls for planning out on your rig. I have seen it many times, even with a smaller guy. Had to put a concrete block and the anchor at the front of a 14 foot rental for a pal if he was solo and he didn't weigh 160. The pitch of the prop will effect the hole shot and how quick she comes up on plane. If you are accelerating slowly she may come up and stay up. Hammer her and see if it makes a difference, be careful, not alone out there when you try. If it never did this last year and you haven't gained a pile of weight someone else here will have a suggestion for you I'm sure. Let us know if this has happened last year like I said.  You just may have to weigh her down or loose some weight! That 4 stroke is heavy compared to an old 2 stroke. Is the 9.9 new? She may even be too heavy for a 200lb 12 footer.  Be careful about 5 years back I rented a pancake flat 12 foot Jon Boat and had an old 9.9 on her. My fishing partner( have to add fishing to partner nowadays my wife says) anyway he was nursing a self inflicted flu one morning and I headed out alone. No way she would come down at the bow. A gust of wind nearly flipped me over as water was coming in at the transom. I swore never again, came home and went out and bought my 19 foot deep V with a 115 Merc. At 225lbs. then that boat never had a chance. Would have been cheaper to loose 25 pounds, did that anyway.  Let us know if this something new happening."
855360,lew,2014-05-27 08:06:00,12766,You may just need to trim the bottom of the motor in a bit.
855362,Terry,2014-05-27 08:46:00,14456,You may just need to trim the bottom of the motor in a bit. yup
855364,Bernie,2014-05-27 10:15:00,3190,Lower the engine down on the trim notches as the fellas have said.A smaller propeller pitch will also help.
855367,DanD,2014-05-27 10:56:00,2223,Trimmed in will drive the bow down    Trimmed out will pitch the bow up    Dan.  
855368,lew,2014-05-27 11:01:00,12766,"Couple good illustrations there Dan, and once a boater finds the sweet spot somewhere in between those 2 adjustments he'll have the boat planing perfectly.  I knew a guy whose tinnie porpoised like crazy with him in the boat alone. I asked why he didn't adjust the trim and he said because the boat always bounced like that & he figured it was normal. I did the adjustment and he couldn't believe how the boat planed perfectly after that."
855369,DanD,2014-05-27 11:26:00,2223,Kind of the same thing with a buddies boat; that thing pulled the tiller to starboard so bad that if he let go the boat would pitch hard to port. The thing was dangerous anything above half throttle. After some convincing he let me adjust the fin above the prop; only turned it maybe a 1/4 inch. He couldn't believe it; wide open throttle and all he had to do is rest his hand on the tiller. Simple adjustments that make a world of difference.  Dan.

855386,Lape0019,2014-05-27 13:04:00,647,Everything stated here is a great start.  Trim the motor in as close to the transom as possible. Change the pitch to 1 or 2 degrees lower than what is on there Add weight to the bow of the boat.  85lbs for a 4 stroke shouldnt have that much of an affect on planing. There really isnt enough of a difference in weight between a 2 and 4 stroke at the 9.9 level to make that big of a difference that you wouldnt be able to solve it with 1 or all of the suggestions here.

855391,OhioFisherman,2014-05-27 13:46:00,6623,"My dad had a 16 foot Sylvan with a 25hp Johnson on it, the worst boat ever for one guy to try and fish out of. No amount of adjustment to the motor helped, anything much faster than a troll would send the bow skyward and block your vision.  A piece of carpet in the bow and a couple of hundred pounds of rocks helped, he even tried a whale tail on the motor without much success. It was a good boat though for inland electric motor only lakes."

I suggest the other site because all the manuals, etc... are available there free of charge as well as the know how from a bunch of old hand techs to help with the inevitable problems that come up with boat ownership.
