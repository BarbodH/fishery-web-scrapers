855634,aznphil,2014-05-28 17:50:00,73,"just wanted to keep this updated for people like myself going through the same pain:  http://www.boatsmartexam.com/blog/post.cfm/boat-registration-process-ontario  The Small Vessel Regulations require that all pleasure craft of all sizes equipped with one or more primary propulsion motors of 10 hp (7.5 KW) or more must be licensed, unless they are registered.  Boat Registration Process in Ontario February 2, 2012 · 9 Comments  Licensing your Boat A Pleasure Craft License is the set of ID numbers displayed on your boat which can be used by Search and Rescue personnel to identify your vessel. A Pleasure Craft License is different than a Vessel Registration, which provides proof of ownership (legal title), a unique name and official number for your boat and the right to use your boat as security for a marine mortgage. The Small Vessel Regulations require that all pleasure craft of all sizes equipped with one or more primary propulsion motors of 10 hp (7.5 KW) or more must be licensed, unless they are registered. The regulation applies to all boats mostly operated or kept in Canada. You can obtain a 10 year license for free from Service Canada. You must renew the license after the 10 year period has expired. If your boat is already licensed, you should make sure that it is in your name and that your contact information is up-to-date. Transferring Ownership of your Boat It is mandatory to report a change of name and address to the Service Canada Pleasure Craft Licensing Centre. If selling a pleasure craft, you must transfer ownership by signing the reverse side of your vessel license and providing it to the purchaser. The purchaser is obligated to complete and sign the reverse side of the vessel license and submit it to Service Canada for transfer within 90 days. An owner may operate the pleasure craft for 90 days after the date of change of name or address, if documents establishing the date of change of name or address are on board. Owner information must be kept up-to-date, including name and address changes.   Registering your Boat in Ontario There are costs involved in registering your vessel, but if you plan to operate your boat in international waters registering you vessel provides the benefit of proof of ownership, in addition to the benefits noted above. In order to register your boat you will be required to select at least 3 names for your vessel (of which one will be approved), pay a registration fee, complete an application for registry, produce evidence of ownership/title and statement of qualification for vessel registration, as well as have your vessel measured for tonnage."

664697,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-02-08 19:28:00,535,"Already got the trailor transferred to my name, but where do I go to get the ownership of a boat changed over?  "
664698,Raf,2012-02-08 19:33:00,3495,service canada  unless they changed that too
664711,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-08 20:16:00,390,Here is the document you need to fill out and submit to change the ownership:  http://www.tc.gc.ca/wwwdocs/Forms/84-0172E_1007-04_E.pdf
664729,irishfield,2012-02-08 21:55:00,26272, Yep... apparently only the folks in New Brunswick have the proper paper and lazer printer now!
664735,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-02-08 22:05:00,535,"Thanks everybody. So the ""pleasure craft licence"" is basically the ownership papers?"
664736,davey buoy,2012-02-08 22:08:00,5505," No,the ownership/registration is for the boat,and the license is to be able to drive it."
664739,irishfield,2012-02-08 22:12:00,26272,"Don't be confusing him Davey Buoy...  The boaters CARD is just that.. a useless card, it is not a licence!  The Vessel Licence is the piece of paper that matches those registration numbers on the boat.  The only LEGAL ownership for the boat.. is the bill of sale, unless you actually register a boat NAME."
664741,davey buoy,2012-02-08 22:13:00,5505,"If you don't have a ownership you have to go to city hall,swear to the JP(don't really swear) that this is your boat.Send that,bill of sale and fill out the service canada ownership change over form and send it all to the address attached which is in New Brunswick."
664743,solopaddler,2012-02-08 22:14:00,8605,"Probably too late now but separate recepts from the seller, one for the boat, one for the motor and one for the trailer can save you some money on taxes.  A private sale the motor's receipt can always be made much lower. Just say it needs work. No one will check."
664744,davey buoy,2012-02-08 22:16:00,5505,"Just went through this myself,what a crock."
664834,spooner_jr,2012-02-09 04:27:00,193,"And remember to keep a copy of both your bill of sale and vessel license on board, or face about a $300? fine."
664836,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-02-09 04:49:00,535,"So basically if I fill out that form and mail it with a copy of the bill of sale, previous pleasure craft licence and a form of ID that'll be fine?"
664867,spooner_jr,2012-02-09 12:20:00,193,"There's a Service Canada location in Belleville, just go there.  http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/cgi-bin/sc-dsp.cgi?rc=3607&ln=eng"
664880,smally21,2012-02-09 13:24:00,993,"there are no ownership papers. there is no registration. the only thing you need to do is fill out the pleasure craft licence and do it online or at service canada. your bill of sale is the only proof or ownership.  so forget this change of ownership and registration there is no such thing. what are these ownership/registration papers? a pleasure craft licence is to identify the vessel, and through that identifier, the operator that fell out of it. it is to assist in SAR. it has nothing to do with driving the boat."
664885,rdambros,2012-02-09 13:49:00,71,"Just another point. If you bought a used 'Ontario' boat, then there is no title. Some American states have title (or ownerships) for their boats and motors. So, in the US you have to transfer title, or ownership, of the boat and the motor. This is similar to what we do in Ontario for cars. But, in Ontario there is no such registration for boats or motors. It is like saying, how to I transfer the ownership of the TV I just bought used on Kijiji. So, as has been stated above, the only proof that you own the boat (or ownership), is the ORIGINAL bill of sale from the dealership and another ORIGINAL bill of sale from the person who bought it from the dealership to YOU. Obviously, if there are other intervening buyers and sellers, then you will need a 'chain of ownership' from the dealership all the way to the current vendor.  What you need to do, is register with Service Canada, that you are now the owner of the boat with certain specific numbers on the side of it. In other words, the previous owner would have applied for the boat numbers and Service Canada knows that this boat number 1234567 belongs to John Smith. When he sells it to you, then you have to advise them that you have the boat with those numbers. It's not really an ownership, its more like a tracking device.  Now, whether its required to be done or not, I don't know. BUT BE CAREFUL. Up until now you only had to pay HST on the trailer. When you advise Service Canada of the sale and request that the boat numbers be transferred to you, then you will get a request to disclose the purchase price. After that, you will get a notice from the government that you owe them HST on the whole value of the boat!!!!!!  So, maybe someone can post any reason to change over the boat numbers, but if I were you, I would leave it."
664921,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-02-09 15:16:00,535,Well I imagine they'll find out eventually so I might as well pay it now. Thanks everybody!
664935,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-09 16:10:00,390," It would be very easy to update or create a pleasure craft license and place in your boat without filling out the forms and going through the paperwork exposing yourself to an HST remittance request. I am not suggesting anyone commit fraud, I'm just saying what I'm thinking out loud."
664938,BillM,2012-02-09 16:16:00,17367,"No ownership papers for the boat, only the trailer....  Closest thing you might get is the registration papers with the numbers (If you can even count that)  Keep your receipts!  That's about all you have as far as ownership is concerned."
664950,DanD,2012-02-09 16:41:00,2223, I’m the one that sold the boat to Dontcryformejanhrdina and yea I want him to register the boat in his name and out of mine. I’m not saying he’s going to do anything wrong while using the boat; but if by chance he did; let’s say for example causes some form accident or is illegally doing something and leaves the scene. A witness to whatever calls the registration numbers into the cops. Then the cops come looking for me; am I going to be a happy camper; not likely.  Dan.
664957,BillM,2012-02-09 17:03:00,17367," No reason to change the numbers, just update the owner information at ServiceOntario."
664962,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-02-09 17:09:00,535,"  Haha don't worry Dan, I've mailed out the paperwork today. Should be in my name before the water opens up and I get a chance to do something stupid.  I still have your trailor plate, want me to mail it to you?"
664985,DanD,2012-02-09 18:47:00,2223,No just scrap it if you've bought a replacement.  Thanks for asking.  Dan.
665264,smally21,2012-02-10 14:34:00,993,"i think the bigger concern DAND is if they find the boat floating empty in the middle of lake ontario and the coast guard phones your wife and tells her you are lost at sea, when as a matter of fact the boat changed hands some time ago and the numbers were never updated, and its DCFMA who is actually lost at sea....  and you get home and all your stuff is gone."
665293,DanD,2012-02-10 15:39:00,2223, It already is; the boat was the last to go and the cash from it went into a new gas cook stove and fireplace. What's the saying; what's mine is her's and what's her's is her's?  Dan.
665334,mudcat,2012-02-10 17:31:00,3,and don't forget ..... the ontario tax man is going to contact you for his cut.
