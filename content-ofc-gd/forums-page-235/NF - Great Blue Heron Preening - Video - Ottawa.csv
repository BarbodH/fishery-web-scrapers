My barred owl family should have chicks within the week, just came back from Algonquin Park (wild brookies and bull moose), and plenty of osprey, heron, and spring bird migration sights.Here is a short video I took last week of a Great Blue Heron preening. Pretty cool to see the wing stretch and neck scratching.    (watch in 1080p HD for best quality)  Cheers,  Justin"
