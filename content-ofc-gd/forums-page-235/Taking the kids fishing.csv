I know I am asking a lot but I don't want to spend $400-$500. They really want to have some fun and go out in a boat and catch a bunch of fish( that's why I want to go after perch). Does anybody know of a charter that will not break the bank and caters to families? If I had to guess it will be a half day event but fingers crossed they will want to stay longer. Any suggestions will be appreciated.  Thanks,  Duxbware and his boys."
