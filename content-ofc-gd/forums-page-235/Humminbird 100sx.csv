855264,davey buoy,2014-05-26 20:18:00,5505,"This is my in boat fish finder.Lately I have noticed the depth readings are all over the place most times.Sometimes 6',15' whatever(accurate),but most times reading #'s like 542,430ft etc,no where near accurate.Gradually been getting worse.Do you ever have to clean and scrub your transducer.?.Just washed mine with a good cleaning soap and rinsed.Looked a bit dirty but nothing serious. Would this little maintenance make a difference?.In 6 years I have never touched it.Thanks for any help guys.  Dave."

My transducer is a shoot thru hull type but I have no idea if that could be causing the same issue on mine."

Mine lew is out the transom and mounted on the lower part 1/2 in water stream.As it should from what I have read and did work well for a while.Wonder if there is a hard reboot for this unit?"
855276,glen,2014-05-26 20:48:00,2641,Your transducer is fried. Only fix is buy a new one.
855277,davey buoy,2014-05-26 20:49:00,5505,Your transducer is fried. Only fix is buy a new one. Think it's worth it for that finder Glen?
855279,glen,2014-05-26 20:51:00,2641,Ebay the finder you have. Look at 718 humminbird.
855288,bushart,2014-05-26 21:39:00,2628,My lowrance also does this once in a while---I think it loses bottom  Like Lew--I shut it off/on works ok

855297,BillM,2014-05-26 22:09:00,17367,Wack it with a hammer   That's a sure sign however that the transducer is on it's way out.  I'd get a replacement on order.
