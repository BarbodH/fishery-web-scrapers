261365,Moosebunk,2008-10-25 00:16:00,3970,Eggs.  They like 'em sunnyside or over easy.  Poachin'em doesn't go over well with most CO's.
261367,danbo,2008-10-25 00:24:00,2646,"1/3 oz Little Cleo's spoons off the rivermouth piers. Black marabou jig in rivers, under a float."
261379,jwl,2008-10-25 00:40:00,1056," where you fishin..not location..type of water, deep river,shallow small river,trib mouth???  deeper water with current..roe,yarnflies,glo-bugs,single egg imitations right now while there is still salmon eggs in the water..later in the season go with minnow imitations like streamers,kwikfish,finesse minnows, even throw jigs with 6 inch white mr twisiters,pinkies....on the float or bottom bouncing a 3-way set up...as for spoons can't beat Gibbs spoons for trout fishing..silver/silver reflective tape or tigermelon are my favs,1/2gold and 1/2 silver Williams...these are just some of my favs for this time of year and into all winter long..I fish trout from about now..actually a little later than now generally..it's too nice out still..lol, right through intro Apr/May when water temps go up too much"
261480,Rich,2008-10-25 14:40:00,3927,"For the salmon I like Cleos - blue/silver or green/silver.. Luhr Jensen Krokodile spoons, Williams Wobblers and Kwikfish.  For the steelhead I'm a roe guy, I prefer brown or chinook roe bags this time of year."
262500,OhioFisherman,2008-10-28 11:27:00,6623,"Never fished for Salmon, but Steelhead this late in the year something that imitates a bait fish. I have caught them on small crankbaits (chrome and black) small spoons (cleo`s ect.) tubes (mostly white with silver fleck) white 3 inch jig and grubs. A lot of them around the breakwalls at the river mouths on Lake Erie here in Ohio.  A shiner on a slip bobber will work too."
262650,GbayGiant,2008-10-28 17:03:00,1780,"I always used roe exclusively all year up into the winter months at the mouths and hardly failed, sometimes I bottom bounced a jig and minnow just like walleye fishing and it can be deadly most days if you can keep from getting hung up too much."
262657,Marko,2008-10-28 17:14:00,854,"This year I`ve had luck using rainbow roe, green and red mepps size 1. Chucking cleos from piers seems to work for everyone but me."
