262326,singingdog,2008-10-27 23:35:00,1047,"Look at where you will be using the boat most of the time. If it's smaller water, then go with something in the 10-13' range. If you are fishing larger water, need to cover more distance, or want more carrying capacity, then look at boats up to 16'.  There are lots of good fishing SOTs out there right now. They are usually set-up with rod holders and places to mount fishfinders. Your best bet is to paddle a few and see how they feel. Check out Yakfisher.net. Lots of Ontario/Quebec yakfishers there to ask questions of, and get advice from."

262463,jediangler,2008-10-28 03:52:00,1923,I'm with singingdog about trying a few before you buy F&A. They have a little paddlefest at Laurel Creek conservation area in the spring where you can try as many as you want in one day. I agree with danbo about the sit in kayak but we are in the minority these days with everyone wanting sit on top yaks. I rented a few different ones myself and used a cheap rec sit in yak for 4 years before I decided to move up to a hybrid canoe/kayak cross. Yakfisher.net is a great new site with Ontario & Quebec guys that really know their stuff. Here is a link.  http://www.yakfisher.net/smffiles/index.php  There is also tons of info on this large american site Kayakfishingstuff with reviews on hundreds of different models.  http://kfs.infopop.cc/groupee/forums  Hope to see you on the water in a new (or used) yak in the spring. Then maybe I'll show you where that quarry is  .
262475,FishHeadRic,2008-10-28 06:45:00,226,"Here's a few links l researched through before l got my Ocean Kayak Caper.  Here's a great site for getting all the info about fishing off a yak. http://www.kayakfishingstuff.com/  Here's a great forum.  (Jedi posted the same site) http://stripersonline.com/surftalk/forumdisplay.php?f=164  Another good one http://www.noreast.com/discussion/TopicList.cfm?forum_ID=17  Here's a great page that will help you compare yaks. http://www.kayakfishingstuff.com/choosing_...shing_kayak.asp   Hope these help. BTW, SOT kayaks are safer to fish from...   FHR"
