260909,HTHM,2008-10-23 14:48:00,4082,I guess no-one has one of these....
260943,POLLIWOGG,2008-10-23 17:36:00,835,"Is that the old 4 cyl chev , if you run it on a set of muffs it sounds just like the old farmall tractor Buddy had one that worked well."
260951,mikeh,2008-10-23 18:15:00,824,back in 1984 I was looking for a 120 i/o and was told to buy a merc instead of the omc they said it was a better drive
260963,2 tone z71,2008-10-23 20:02:00,1311,"yes if it has an OMC verticle drive on it RUN ,dont look back ,if its got a Mercruiser or Volvo your ok they where a decent small lil package"
262502,OhioFisherman,2008-10-28 11:34:00,6623,"Pretty sure it was a chevy engine, a lot of them were around and seemed to be a pretty decent mid-sized engine and drive."
262516,Sinker,2008-10-28 12:24:00,8692,"Like already said, watch out for the OMC drives. Hard to get parts, and very pricy!! I'm sure the Hull is bulletproof though!!  Sinker"
