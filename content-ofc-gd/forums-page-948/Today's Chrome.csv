Near the end of it, the float shot down hard - no doubting what it would be. He gave me a great fight. No jumps but lots of runs. Just having him on was a treat, and landing him was a bonus. Having 20km an hour winds was also a treat, compared to yesterday's all-out wind assault!      cheers! p.-"

262635,Paulus,2008-10-28 16:20:00,522,"   tisk tisk. Jealousy is a wasted emotion, Mike.  No worries, though: I know that by ""hideous"" you mean ""gorgeous.""  Hopefully you get to admire my new handles first-hand, soon  They are swweeeeeeeet!  p.-  p.s. for those who want to know, I used the macro setting for the shot(s ... took 4 quickly and this was the best one). With point & shoot cameras, it helps sharpen the focus on your subject, which brings out the colours a little more."
