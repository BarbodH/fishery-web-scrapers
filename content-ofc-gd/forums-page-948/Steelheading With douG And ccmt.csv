261505,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-10-25 15:42:00,1362,Greta report and pics guys!!!....I really enjoyed that!
261512,tbayboy,2008-10-25 16:32:00,1497,"Wondeful report guys.  Hard to believe you got any fishing done with all the photo taking.  Some really amazing photos, thanks for sharing."
261527,ehg,2008-10-25 18:01:00,2666,Some real nice looking fish!  Amazing it all co-ordinated so that you all got tegether and on a good location at prime time. Someone did their homework  Great post and lotsa good pictures. ehg
261637,jrego7,2008-10-26 00:06:00,37,Is that the Rouge or Humber?
261653,Greencoachdog,2008-10-26 00:33:00,8163, 
261662,douG,2008-10-26 00:50:00,2693,"Rap's, yup.  It pretty much is.  You might want to explore the US of A for steelhead.  Lots of tribs are well stocked and managed, with good runs of fish.  Put in the time, Lake Ontario and Erie, you will make your own history."
261664,jrego7,2008-10-26 00:54:00,37,I plan on exploring the rouge and humber. Just trying to find a place with some g4 guide waders. Wilson's doesnt have my size and BPS doesnt carry them
261666,Greencoachdog,2008-10-26 00:56:00,8163, That narrows it down a LOT!!!  ... yanno your headwear in those pics makes ya look like a commie eh?
261670,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-26 01:05:00,10439,  Definately the Don!!!!! Should be prime tomorrow after this rain!!!!
261672,douG,2008-10-26 01:15:00,2693,"OKOKOK, it's Massachusetts, I can't believe that youse guys figgered it out so quick.  Look for the tree beside the big stone, you can't miss it.  Tons o fish.  GCD, not a Commie, just a socialist adherent to the Prophet.  Imshallah."
261691,JohnF,2008-10-26 01:59:00,3494, I thought it was vaguely Afghanistanish. I just watched Charlie Wilson's War last night and he wore something like that.  JF
261693,limeyangler,2008-10-26 02:01:00,5204,
261757,Spiel,2008-10-26 13:19:00,9065,....Ah man you guys is making me extremely jealous. Certainly a kind of day I'd love to share in and having enjoyed the company of both Doug and Cliff I can't see how it'd be a bad day even if the fishing wasn't explosive. Well done guys!
261765,ccmtcanada,2008-10-26 13:31:00,7971,"Thanks everyone....it was a day to remember for sure....I never thought in a million years that I'd have a chance to fish waters like that, have as much fun as I did, and also have my best day for steelhead all wrapped in one outing.  All made possible by OFC....I'd never have met these guys without it!"
261774,Greencoachdog,2008-10-26 13:50:00,8163,  ... and you didn't even have to wait for bly to catch you a big fish to hold up in a pic!!!
261822,ccmtcanada,2008-10-26 15:27:00,7971, Have you been told yet today?
261952,douG,2008-10-26 22:08:00,2693,"Cliff, I have a funny feeling, an intuition if you will, that GCD gets told on a regular basis.  It's all part of that Redneck Charm."
261968,Greencoachdog,2008-10-26 22:34:00,8163,"    I've had people call me on the phone and wake me up in the morning just so they can be the first one to ""tell me"" that day."
261996,camillj,2008-10-26 23:27:00,1988,Great report guys ... what a chromefest ... and I was up north elbow deep in eavestrough-doo-doo .... oh well ...  my time will come  ... probably later this week ..... but just when I think I recognize it I see a stretch of creek that looks too sweet to be one of the ones I normaly play around in ....
261997,figureight,2008-10-26 23:29:00,40,Its obvious what creek those steelhead are from
262009,irishfield,2008-10-26 23:46:00,26272,"It is is it figureight ?!  I know.. but then again one of them thar gents ""bosses"" told my honey where they were off to last week....  Some great shootin their guys. Good to see a trio of OFC'rs out having a good time."
262127,Mike the Pike,2008-10-27 04:20:00,3421,What a great report boyz nice fish too . Doug looks like he had one great day.  Now DouG has a clean cut manly haircut and you have a pic of him peeing like a girl His daughters are having an impact on him.  Doug no longer lifts the seat at home the wimmins in his house have trained him to sit down while peeing.  excellent report loved every word and pic of it
262215,corvette1,2008-10-27 16:37:00,1765,great report as allways looks like you guys had great day in the water
262218,strakey,2008-10-27 16:44:00,78,Man solo you seem to find these magical rivers with great steelhead runs. Not even a map book could help out the less fortunate fisherman to attain such success. Great outing and pics.  spawn
261309,solopaddler,2008-10-24 21:35:00,8605, John I was just joking. Especially later in the fall when the water temps drop the afternoon is by far the best time of day to fish. I'd be honoured if you could join me for a day.  Cheers
261310,Joey,2008-10-24 21:38:00,9122,Just a wonderful report guys.  To say I'm a bit jealous is an understatement.  Looks like a really good time and some nice chromers there.  Joey
261312,workwear,2008-10-24 21:49:00,592,ummmm.....gps co-ordinace would be nice......lol..   great pics guys.....a wonderful day to say the least  just picked up my new center pin...can't wait to get in on all the fun
261316,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-24 21:56:00,10439,    Send me 6 BILLION dollars and I will tell you exactly where they were!!
261318,danc,2008-10-24 21:57:00,4677,"Superb report Mike, Cliff and Doug. It was great to see Doug's enthusiasm. Looks like Cliff's becoming an old pro."
261340,Basskicker,2008-10-24 23:15:00,421,All I can say is wow...once again.  Just curious Mike...you don't happen to have large hidden compartment in your truck that I can hide in?  Ask Cliff he'll explain..  ...WTG guys looks like an awesome day for sure!!!!  Jason
261341,rock34,2008-10-24 23:18:00,215,This looks like an insane day gentlemen! Congrats!

261360,Moosebunk,2008-10-25 00:10:00,3970,Reports like this kill me when I can't fish.  Seven months a year to your twelve in the south...  Steelheading fun for the whole family... Great fishing guys.   Looks mint out there out the stream.
261373,JohnF,2008-10-25 00:32:00,3494, Yer on.  JF

261396,douG,2008-10-25 01:51:00,2693,"That was very funny right there, JohnF.  Someday, we will meet up and fish, and have a great time with tears of laughter.  Looking forward to that."
261397,fishindevil,2008-10-25 01:59:00,6254,"Agreat day on the water guys !!!!.  ..some very nice fish,and that river really looks nice too.  ..cheers"

261268,douG,2008-10-24 19:53:00,2693,"Great report, Mike.  Even though I don't remember some of those things transpiring exactly the same as you described, everything you said was pretty much true.  Mike, please let me say how happy I was to get to fish with you and Cliff yesterday, and to thank you for putting on a true clinic for me.  You were extremely generous with your time, advice and patience, and you were as thrilled as I was when I started to hit them.  That day won't soon be forgotten.  And Cliff, it is always a treat to be able to fish with you.  Many thanks to you too.  I'll put up some pictures tonight."
261274,troutologist,2008-10-24 20:03:00,951,Looks like a beauty day there gents. Keep up the good work!
261277,silvio,2008-10-24 20:08:00,433,"Hate my life!!!  Good job boys, Maybe next week well have a shoot at paradise."
261278,snag,2008-10-24 20:10:00,1932,"Brilliant as always !  Poor Doug. When ya gotta go, ya gotta go. (good thing it gets caught on camera!)  Well done!"
261279,LeXXington,2008-10-24 20:10:00,1928,"Super going guys, Thoes picks were amazing.  Thanks for sharing"
261285,ccmtcanada,2008-10-24 20:32:00,7971,"The day was perfect....well except for the fact I was up at 2:30am.....  It was overcast and cold to start the day, but once the sun came up, the clouds went away, the sun came out and it was perfect out there.  Even had to shed the heavier jacket later in the day.  Thanks Mike...as usual, the fishing was great, but the overall experience was phenomenal!  Doug...you were a blast to fish with on this day as well...like a kid in a candy store.  Whenever you had a fish on, the excitement on your face was just priceless!!!  Anyhow, here are the pics....  Doug with his first decent sized Steelie ever....see his ""kid in the candy store look?""                 This guy didn't want to wait around for a picture....so it had a premature release....LOL "
261292,silvio,2008-10-24 20:55:00,433, Nice pics...
261293,Whopper,2008-10-24 20:56:00,2174,Awesome account of your time spent together fellas!
261294,JohnF,2008-10-24 21:00:00,3494,"That looks like an excellent way to spend part of a day. Creek wading is the way to go.  Two questions:  1. Does anyone here use a river stick? I have one, courtesy of a friendly Ottawa Valley beaver. It was lightweight (some kind of Poplar I think), already stripped of it's bark, and ready to go. All I had to do was drill three holes and insert two pieces of light cord. One for a wrist wrap and the other so I could hang it across my back when not in use. The top end sticks up over my left shoulder so it doesn't interfere with my cast. It's very handy for fast flowing creeks when the water gets up around my hips and I can no longer see the bottom.  2. Are there any lazy steelheads that don't start swimming until a more reasonable hour, like 10 am? I don't function well at 5 am. In fact, I may not even function at all. I did well to get out at 8:30 this morning on yet one more fruitless basschase in the Thames. Lotsa pretty scenery (we tried a new spot) but no bass.  JF"
261295,kingofthesteelhead,2008-10-24 21:01:00,140,I dare you to come out east and do that! Maybe on monday and tuesday.
261297,solopaddler,2008-10-24 21:08:00,8605, Normally I'd be up for a dare but this time I think I'll pass  .  Should be good out there Mon/Tues though.
261298,solopaddler,2008-10-24 21:10:00,8605," To answer your questions, no and once again no."
261299,msp,2008-10-24 21:10:00,1336,I thought that that was out east.Wasnt that Oshawa Creek?
261304,bigugli,2008-10-24 21:23:00,6138,"Amazing report fellas.  Great catch of fish.  Doug, what is it with Finns and singing. Were we all brought up watching Hymn Sing on CBC?"
261308,JohnF,2008-10-24 21:32:00,3494," That sux. It's one thing fer you young budgers to get up that early, you aren't already in countdown mode like us old codgers. We're avoiding greeting the next day like the plague, cuz it's the downhill side of everything that's good, unless you value value baldness and decrepitude. And when yer old and creaky, the balance goes second. Y'all think ya know what goes first and it ain't memory, and it also ain't what yer thinkin'. I'd share it with y'all, but ya need to find out fer yerselfs.  The MNR needs to develop a fish species that thrives on sunlight and shallow water (other than those dang' carp), that gets up late in the morning and is attracted to (sparse) grey hair .... oh yeah, and portliness. Then they need to impose new fishing regs that allow only those of us over 60 to prey on these particularly dumb lazy fish. It would be nice if they'd be toothless like bass and disinclined towards long spooling runs.  The world is tilted in favour of you young studs.  JF"
