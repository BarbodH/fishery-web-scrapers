262452,John Bacon,2008-10-28 03:13:00,3277,I saw a wild turkey (bird not human) walking along the sidewalk on Meadowvale Road this morning.  It is close to the Rouge; but it is still quite surprising to see it strolling down a major road.
262459,Greencoachdog,2008-10-28 03:35:00,8163,  This is the best kind of Wild Turkey!!!
262465,kemper,2008-10-28 03:58:00,2232,Did you lean your .45 out the window and take her down?  I would have.
262466,GBW,2008-10-28 04:05:00,8460,"watch out for deer just North of Taunton Rd on Thickson Rd in Whitby as I have had a very close call and seen others there last week. Now, GCD, I said DEER not BEER..."
262470,bigugli,2008-10-28 04:57:00,6138,There are thousands of turkeys in Scarberia. They mostly originate from the darkest depths of Agincourt. Best place to witness the mating ritual; Scarborough Town Centre. Best place to hunt down the male of the species; Brim & Eg Beer Store.
262491,Paully,2008-10-28 10:37:00,712,I seen a wild turkey @ meadowvale a few weeks a go... perhaps it was the same one?
262492,Wild,2008-10-28 10:58:00,704,Let us know if any Pheasants are seen.
262608,Headhunter,2008-10-28 15:20:00,5703,"I have the Rouge valley in my backyard, actually, it is my backyard! I haven't seen a turkey yet, but I do have many deer, chipmunks, rabbits and hawks... and I hear that cougars frequent the Black Dog on Thursday nights! LOL HH"
262611,GBW,2008-10-28 15:28:00,8460,"yeah, those cougars are looking for a gobble-gobble too!"
262756,mbac31,2008-10-28 21:13:00,904,"I have seen a few this year in my backyard. I live on the other side of Meadowvale rd, the other side of the river. I have yet to see a cougar but have found a few dead animals mangled all to hell these last couple of years while walking along there.  I have 2 beagles with me mostly and have seen a bear track or 2 as well down there. You can hear the turkeys sometimes. Coyotes are  plentiful and just plain sots, not afraid of anything.  Tons of dear and other wildlife around here.  PS the cougars you are speaking of are usually at Wobbly Pops at Manse and Kingston rd on any given night. Beware though!!!  Make sure you get your shots first."
262789,camillj,2008-10-28 22:32:00,1988,  Well .. I can honestly say... as a fella who grew up in Agincourt (in the early 70's) ... many a Pheasant and grouse was fluhed out of the hydro fields between Kennedy and Warden (near Tam O Shanter golf course) .. not sure if they still exist though
262794,bigugli,2008-10-28 22:38:00,6138,Same with the area north of Finch from Midland to Markham rd. before the developments
262797,misfish,2008-10-28 22:45:00,29133, Now that was FUNNY. TY
