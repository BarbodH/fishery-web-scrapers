Gave it a half an hour with nothing so decided to pack up and go for a little drive. After a little hike through the bush we arrived at the spot. fished for an hour and a half with nothing then i caught about 3 or so pound pike. Not two minutes after my buddy hits a 3.5lb rainbow, and about ten minutes after that i hit a nice rainbow gave me a good battle with the 6lb test and lots of logs near by. Packed it in shortly after that. With some fresh rainbow roe from the small female we kept this morning i decided to hit a spot for an hour before dinner,and ended getting another feisty little rainbow.  "
