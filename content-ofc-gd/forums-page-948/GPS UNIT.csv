We are none profit and only get so much to operate a year  GPS UNIT  Does anyone have an old surplus GPS unit that they'd be willing to donate  to TOWARF, the unit must be able to output NMEA position data. The GPS unit will be connected to the ICOM vhf radio in the radio room to enable the heading and range of position requests to the rescue boat to be displayed.   Many Thanks   Mike   Thanks Peter"
260714,SlowPoke,2008-10-22 17:15:00,2984,"I would happily donate MONEY to the cause to put towards a new unit.  TOWARF works in conjunction with the Coastgaurd to save our sorry butts on Lake Ontario, it's the least I could do!  If a handfull of us chipped in a few bucks, it wouldn't take long to get a new GPS. A challange to all the Lake O trollers!"
260716,PERCHER,2008-10-22 17:39:00,787,COUNT ME IN !
260727,BITEME,2008-10-22 18:26:00,1969,I guess i should have worded the title different Im not looking to pimp money but if you have a unit kicking around thats a different story thanks to those that have responded though it is a very generous thought  Peter
260738,SlowPoke,2008-10-22 19:02:00,2984,"Your wording was fine Pete - I didn't think you were pimping! I'd like to help out but I don't have an old unit to offer. If you don't get a used unit donated, I'd be happy to contribute or even spearhead a fundraising drive for a new one. Anyone that fishes Lake Ontario has benefitted or knows someone who has benefitted from TOWARF. Keep us informed! -Brian"
260849,Dabluz,2008-10-23 02:05:00,701,Try getting a GPS manufacturer to donate one.  Send them an official letter asking for such a unit.  I'm sure that they would send a refurbished unit.
262576,BITEME,2008-10-28 14:26:00,1969,just want to bump this once more and i promise i will let sleeping dogs lie
