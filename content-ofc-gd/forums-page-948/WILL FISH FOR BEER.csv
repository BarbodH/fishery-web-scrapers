261455,mistyriver1,2008-10-25 12:29:00,600,Well done Snag.  Excellent way to make your point.

262110,Bernie,2008-10-27 03:24:00,3190,Dang almost missed this one too! Well done there Snag! A buddy and I built a motorized go-kart when we were kids collecting bottles for the welding and some materials. Waste not-want not was a favorite saying by my dear old Grandma.
262267,danc,2008-10-27 20:35:00,4677,It's a shame that some people don't recycle. Even some animals are starting to catch on. Great post Snag!!  
262432,snag,2008-10-28 02:38:00,1932," Ouch!  Are we talking about reproduction, Casanova?   Now that's cool. A definite feeling of rewarding your efforts there.   Thanks Dan!  More people ""otter"" recycle. Look at it's face. It looks proud, LOL.  (uh, look like an otter?)"
262445,Markystang,2008-10-28 02:57:00,131,"I always take garbage out with me, whether it's mine or not. Even if it's not worth 10cents. It upsets me when I see styrofoam worm containers, old line, bottles, Timmie's cups etc. thrown on the ground where I like to fish. It gives all anglers a bad name. I always make sure I clean up at least some of it on my way out."
260404,Daplumma,2008-10-21 18:35:00,1961,"Well done Snag,wish we had a bounty on them green necks down here. Joe"
260408,bigugli,2008-10-21 18:55:00,6138,"Well done snag  That is the most interesting way I have ever seen anyone preach the oudoor gospel. ""Take out more than you took in"". I pick up about $25 a month in beer empties a month to fuel my boat for most of the year. If you want to throw your money away, kindly deposit it in my driveway. I don't mind.  In addition I retrieve 1000 lbs of pop cans a year from my neighbourhood and numerous fishing holes. Of course, I have a very specialized gaff for snagging my catches. http://www.foodservicedirect.com/largeView...c=AR363744L.jpg  With this gaff I can snag hundreds of those beauties in an hour.  Thank you for giving us a truly ""Pythonesque""  presentation."

I've used that suction grabber at my parents. They rock when the prey are skanky!   Anything to put a smile on yer perdy face    You are correct it was actually a smallie caught here last year. Those spinners rule!   Thanks Bill, I owe you a big thanks for all your musky posts from the Bog. Learned a lot from them.   They seem to always be in season, especially the Germans.   Surprised I remembered the lyrics. Must've been a flash back from the Berkely shows   Awesome Carole, They add up. My house seems like a hatchery on the weekends"

Here's the fall ""harvest"" to date:   Don't know what I'm doing with this collection, but the summer round up bought a number of kids rod & reel combos  It's a pity I can't collect a bounty on all the plastic lying around.

260639,snag,2008-10-22 13:05:00,1932, Wow Bigugli that is very impressive!!!!  I do hope that those plastic bottles get banned ASAP.  Heard they did a study recently and they found our tap water to be higher quality???
260641,snag,2008-10-22 13:11:00,1932," And to think that when I was a kid it was only .05 cents for stubbies   I am demented. I would like to see a deposit on plastics too or just banish them all together. At least the paper cups will degrade a little better  Irony, you put beer on a stretcher when you were young, Now the beer puts you on a stretcher when your old.

I treminded me of a local to erieau i met this summer who singlehandedly cleans up that town by collecting all the bottles and cans around the lake shore. he let me fish from the dock behind his house and in return i loaded my pick up truck for trips to the beer store to cash in...one trip i had over $60.....my pick up was full."

260288,snag,2008-10-21 14:56:00,1932,"I'm sure this will be pinned and bookmarked for generations to absorb   This is not a post to glorify alcohol.  It is a post meant to gorify waste (and inspire conservation).   For years I have fished around parks and waterways that are hemorrhaging money.  Every time I go out I noticed FREE MONEY!!!!! in the form of discarded bottles and cans.  As a child we had no allowance. My family lived near a large park where my brothers and I made a killing collecting bottles and cans.  I figured,  Why not capitalize on my fishing excursions. Would you not bend over to pick up 10 cents? (think about what you bend over for right now)   Sadly, the images you'll see are not staged. I could have taken hundreds of these!   Here is a lone Stella fish suspending, enjoying a little sun. (Tip: They hang close to walls to bask in the warmth the concrete has accumulated)   Nearly missed this guy lurking in the weeds. (Tip: Structure, Structure, Structure)   Some like a mix of rock and branches. (notice the damage to it's spine)   Again, Structure!!!   Found this blue hole. They are amazing when they school like this. Finesse is key and don't be afraid to try different presentations.     Nice mixed bag for 10 min. of fishing! (See that German lunker in the middle!)   Now, I like to clean my own catch. I cut off the skin to get rid of fat and toxins. You'll see in the back I've put it's guts in a glass.   If you don't want to clean your catch, take it here. They even offer to buy your catch   With the money you'll make, you can go here.   You can then catch one of these.   You can cook it, gracefully.   And dine in pleasure. (You will even have a little extra money for a late night movie and reading material)   So now you know how to:  1. Pay yourself to fish 2. Clean up the environment 3. Feed yourself and others  Look for the instructional DVD and audio tapes coming soon!  Regards,  S."
