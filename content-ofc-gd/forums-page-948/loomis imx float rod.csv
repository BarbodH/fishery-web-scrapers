262141,kentooley,2008-10-27 09:39:00,208,Try posting WTB on ff.net...you'll probably get a response. I picked one up on Thursday for $4oo(mint). It is one sweet stick!!!  Good Luck!  Chris
262225,jdmls,2008-10-27 17:04:00,575,100% guarantee you will not find an IMX 13ft on the shelf.....verminator has the best idea ... most guys are asking $400-$500 used. You have to act fast as they get scooped up pretty quick.
