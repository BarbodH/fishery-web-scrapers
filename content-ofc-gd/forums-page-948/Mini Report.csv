Ignoring the looks of friends and family who thught we were crazy we headed up Saturday night after work, and left the wives snoring at the cottage Sunday morning.  After the second or third trolling run, we stopped to do a weed check, and cast around a small weedbed we drifted across while setting up for the next line, and this nice little guy slammed my bait:    An honest 15 1/2 inches (and a close 16 if measured creatively!)  One coffee break, and a quite a few rain drops later, johnnyb picked this lovely 18incher up as we trolled a line across the same weedbed:    Despite the weather, and the slow bite this was a great time.  Fishing this late in the season is new to me, but I'm already trying to squeeze another trip in before ice closes in.  Sorry for the grainy pics, all I took was my cell given the weather conditions.

262292,irishfield,2008-10-27 22:17:00,26272,Well at least you were smart and left Jessie in the cottage.... as she would have shown you how to find them! LOL  Good stuff guys...
262296,johnnyb,2008-10-27 22:24:00,3413," I see you haven't successfully blocked out those painful memories, Wayne   Luckily for us, it was just a bit too cold and wet for Jess to work her evil charms on the walleye.  Although she's already talking about a make-up voyage a couple weeks from now....  Thanks for puttin up the report, and putting up with me, cousin...I'm glad we got a chance to get out there, AND get you your first of what will hopefully be many tasty walleye"
