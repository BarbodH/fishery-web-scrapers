262001,John Bacon,2008-10-26 23:33:00,3277,Did anybody hear of a bear sighting at the Rouge?  I dropped by my parent's house today.  My mother mentioned that by brother-in-law had dropped by Rouge to walk his dog.  He was told to leave because a bear had been sighted.  Did anybody else hear of a bear sighting?  This would have been on Highway 2 at Glenn Rouge campgroud.
262008,irishfield,2008-10-26 23:43:00,26272,Probably just some steelheader wanting the river to themselves! LOL
262030,bigugli,2008-10-27 00:15:00,6138,Just some biker lost his way from the clubhouse. Easy to mistake for a lumbering bear after a few too many
262069,lucabrasi,2008-10-27 01:43:00,114,"Haven't heard but it wouldn't suprise me, they're turning up everywhere these days, Newmarket, Bolton, Orangeville. If deer could thrive in the Don Parklands in the inner bowels of a large city it's not so hard to believe that bears could make their residence in Glen Rouge. Either that or something escaped from the zoo.  But all of these possiblities are ridiculous compared to the most plausible explanation.....sasquatch."
262070,glen,2008-10-27 01:45:00,2641,Set up a tree stand.
262075,danc,2008-10-27 01:57:00,4677," If I didn't go anywhere that a bear has been sighted, I'd never leave the house."
262106,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-27 03:06:00,10439,"  Yeah, no kidding!!!! This summer we had not only bears in the hood, we also had a cougar (feline kind, not Bar Fly kind   ) running around my area."
262159,Bob,2008-10-27 12:31:00,370,"We see bears all over town here.  They especially like the dumpsters behind Timmie's, Rotten Ronnie's and colonel Chicken.  Just another form of entertainment here.  One day I was taking some pictures of a momma and 3 cubs about a hundred yards or so from my back door and a couple of young ladies came up behind me.  One asked me what I'd do if momma came after me?  I told her that wasn't likely as I didn't constitute any kind of threat to her or the young'uns.  Next question of course was ""Yeah but what if?""  I said I'd run like hell.  ""But you can't outrun a bear!"" Of course my answer was ""I only have to outrun you.""  Young ladies took a head start and I continued taking pictures for another half hour."
262161,kentooley,2008-10-27 12:49:00,208,"Depending on how ugly it was, it may have been my ex wife."
262167,ricoboxing,2008-10-27 13:16:00,398,not surprised. last summer my sons daycare (kingston rd/altona) was in lockdown after a they spotted a loose bear in pickering. they ended up catching it in the liverpool rd/kingston rd area. i guess a bear lockdown is better than a lockdown because of some gang shooting.
262176,BillM,2008-10-27 13:29:00,17367,Why are people so worried about bears? (Honest question)  Do they think they just randomly attack people?  Give me a bear over a cougar anyday.
262179,kentooley,2008-10-27 13:58:00,208,That cougar you speak of could be my ex as well!!!
262197,Pachone,2008-10-27 14:38:00,276,unreal. Glenn Rouge campground / Twin Rivers is basically where I live. 2 minute walk!!! AH LOL  I have a feeling its the steelheader theory LOL
262198,BillM,2008-10-27 14:50:00,17367,"  Ok, not all cougars are bad"
262200,kentooley,2008-10-27 14:58:00,208, You haven't met my ex.  :lol:  :lol:
262203,wuchikubo,2008-10-27 15:23:00,1114, I'm glad I didn't have any drink in my hands when I read that.   I was going to say something but I think I best keep my thoughts to myself.
