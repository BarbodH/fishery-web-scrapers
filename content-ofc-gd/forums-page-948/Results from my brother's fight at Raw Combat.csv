He accepted a fight against Keto Allen, an undefeated fighter in the 185lbs (middleweight) division.  Mike cuts a lot of weight to make 185 lbs (usually from around 210-215), but he's not exactly ripped like most other fighters, so although he cuts more weight than most, he is usually substantially smaller than his opponent.  Case in point.    Both fighters weighed in at 185.5 pounds, and you can still see a significant size difference.    Mike feeling good before the fight    Final check before entering the cage.    Some feeling out at the beginning    Mike got caught with a big punch, followed by a flurry of strikes then caught in an arm-in guillotine against the cage which went to the mat.    Mike was able to pass Keto's guard and eliminate all pressure from the guillotine, here he worked quickly before Keto got to his feet.    Mike working for another takedown    Mike got the takedown and immediately into side control    Then into mount where he rained down some punishment    Still in mount    Mike went for an armbar from mount and missed it, where he ended up on his back.    He remained here for the rest of the round taking a few shots on the ground.    Round 2 begins and Mike is throwing leg kicks to start, then the tables turned, Mike took a solid kick to the liver where he crumpled to the mat, with Keto following and throwing punches to the liver and kidneys.    After taking a bunch of shots on the ground, Mike tapped out due to strikes.  Although we were all dissapointed, we were proud at the same time.  Mike took a fight against a more experienced opponent, and at 19 years of age, his opponent was also 10 years his elder.  The shot to the liver was ultimately the deciding factor in this fight, its unfortunate but as they say, fecal matter happens.    Mike and our dad after his fight, face a bit sore.  Mike's next step ... weight loss, and fighting at a lower weight class.  Thanks guys."

262173,BillM,2008-10-27 13:23:00,17367,"Liver/kidney shots are the worst, absolute worst.  Looks like your brother dished out some punishment of his own!!"
262177,charlesn,2008-10-27 13:30:00,551,Takes guts to step in to any full contact fighting arena.  To do so against a bigger and more experienced undefeated professional says something about your bro.  Much respect to him.  Charles
262186,Rich,2008-10-27 14:17:00,3927,"Good stuff for your bro! Can't say I'd be jumping in the cage with that guy anytime soon (or your bro for that matter). Takes some real guts and determination.. and he did really well, all things considered."
262187,Rustic-Fisher,2008-10-27 14:20:00,826,"That guy Mike fought was a monster,  your Bro's got ball's..  Ryan"
262207,steverowbotham,2008-10-27 15:43:00,1800,"A lot more balls than I'd ever have thats for sure.  I'm in Banff right now, but when I get home I'll upload the video.  I never added in the ""play-by-play"" but when Mike was on his back for the last two minutes of the round, he was working for submissions the whole time.  You'll see in the video he tries twice for an armbar, once for a triangle and at one point comes very close to locking up a kneebar.  This guy at 185lbs I think was just too powerful."
262212,Mike Pike,2008-10-27 16:21:00,1332,Sounds like he had a competative fight against a more experienced fighter up until the kidney shot.  Good luck to your bro the rest of the way.  He's one tough dude!
262219,modny,2008-10-27 16:47:00,502,"wow big ups to your bro  before even reading this thread i was thinking to myself, wow that black dude towers over that white kid  so the fact that he even gave him a good run for his money is great  mad props"
262334,steverowbotham,2008-10-27 23:40:00,1800,"Haha.  Mike is a very experienced wrestler who has competed internationally.  He made his pro debut last October with next to no training whatsoever, and although he went 6-0 as an amateur, once he stepped up in competition, his lack of knowledge showed.  Although he outwrestled his opponent at will, he lost a SPLIT decision. His opponent worked very well off his back.  Mike began taking it a lot more seriously after that loss and began training in every aspect of the sport.  Being a gifted wrestler, he had a great base to work with, and jiu jitsu came very naturally to him, being a grappler.  He showed this in his 2nd pro fight in June submitting his much larger opponent by armbar at 2:14 of the first round.  For this fight, he fought well against a much larger opponent and fellow wrestler.  Mike still has a long way to go in his striking, but with time, I believe it will come."
