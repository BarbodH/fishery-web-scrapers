262666,love2fishhave2work,2008-10-28 17:38:00,212,Last year I took my 18 foot 115 optimax to bass pro for winterization service.  Is this something I have to do?  What do people on this board do outside of shrink wrapping to winterize their boat?  Thanks

262718,doubleheader,2008-10-28 19:21:00,497,"Well, here's what I do.  Mind you my boat is stored cold:  Boat: Make sure all compartments are thoroughly dry. Blow out livewell water lines, pull boat plug and tilt high enough to insure everything is empty, pull batteries, remove bow mount motor, top off gas, add Stabil to fuel and run so that it thru the entire system, pull prop clean, lub, and reinstall.  Main 4 stroke Motor: Change lower unit lub, motor oil and filter, pull plugs and spray fogger product into cylinder, turn motor over, reinstall plugs  Aux. motor:  Pretty much same as above.  Store motors in vertical position to insure no water is entrapped."

I also tape a large garbage bag over the entire motor- no shrink wrap, and punch a couple of holes in the bottom for drainage."
