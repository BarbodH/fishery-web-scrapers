262229,evster,2008-10-27 17:25:00,367,"I don't think I ever shared my entry into the wfn adopt an angler contest on here.  It took me until near the end of the contest to get it finished so I wasn't even close int he running for secondary prizes based on online voting.  But I held out and waited, waited waited...until they finally announced the winner.  And it wasn't me...  The winner was from Woodstock, maybe he's a member on here.  Anyway, I meant to share this earlier but kept forgetting.  Here's my entry, even though I didn't win it sure was fun to make.  http://www.wfn.tv/adopt/x6p2269g-1"

I'm sure WFN made a long, thought out decision on who should have won and deserved it, it took them quite a long time.   Try to get your entry in earlier next year and let us know, we can all vote  Congrats to the winner, wonder if he's an OFC'r?  Joey"
