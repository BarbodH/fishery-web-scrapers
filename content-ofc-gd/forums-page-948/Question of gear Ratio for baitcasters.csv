261049,bassin,2008-10-24 01:05:00,15,"Two years ago, I purchased a Curado with gear ratio of 5.0:1. I used it for pitching and flipping. I often found that when I detected a fish strike, the gear ratio is not big enough for me to reel in slack quick and thus ended up losing fish.  My other baitcasters have ratio of 6.0:1. I am fine with them for pitching, casting and cranking. I just bought another Curado with gear ratio of 7.0:1. I intend to use it exclusively for pitching and flipping.  I can trade in my old Curado, but wonder whether I can match it with my cranking rod for the use of crankbaits. I know low gear baitcaster is good for bottom fishing and trolling. What about cranking? The cranking rod has moderate fast tip and I think smaller gear ratio and slower retrieval speed reel may be a perfect match. Would like to know from your experience. Thanks."
261051,forrest,2008-10-24 01:18:00,1032,The measurement that counts is inches per crank.  my 5:1 spinning reel does the same line uptake as my 7:1 baitcaster.  do what feels right for your fishing.....ignore the marketing A longer rod can help...  forrest
261054,PatrickGG,2008-10-24 01:23:00,562,"I have a curado also with a 5:0:1 Gear ratio which i will never trade it off, just remember some days when the fishing is slow that real will be the best thing to use when using Crank baits."

261067,bassin,2008-10-24 02:04:00,15,"Thanks guys. I may keep it for crankbaits. No doubt Curado is a great reel. Danbo, the link is what I need for winter."
261108,singingdog,2008-10-24 10:02:00,1047,"Why not trade in the slower reel? You can always fish a fast reel slower, but not the other way around. If you are using it for cranks and need to put the burn on, the high-speed will come in handy."
261125,johnnyb,2008-10-24 12:43:00,3413,"nice to have a low ratio cranker around...if you need to burn in a crankbait, that's what sweeping the rod is for.  If you're going to have a few reels, may as well have a few different ratios"
261323,Garry2Rs,2008-10-24 22:17:00,1425,"While my Musky reel was at the doctor, I once put a 6 to 1 Chronarch on a musky rod and tried to use it to crank Bucktails. The drag from those big baits made it very hard to reel them in.  I thought I was going to sprain my wrist. Take it from me, your 5 to 1's will be your favourite reel whenever you are using big baits and deep divers. Garry2R's"
261387,bassin,2008-10-25 01:13:00,15,Thanks. I will keep it. This is what joining this board for.
261456,mbac31,2008-10-25 13:12:00,904,THe curado 5:0:1 reels are great for slow rolling bigger blades on spinnerbaits and is awesome for bigger wakebaits or cranks. I even have the 3 speeds fromk shimano as well. You can get by with a normal 6 speed reel its much nicer and easier on your arms with these when you use a technique such as slow rolling or cranking. I love my 5 ratio reels for swimbaits like the Giron and Matt lures
261484,Rich,2008-10-25 14:47:00,3927,"Lower gear ratio tends to be better for cranking, coupled with a soft action rod. Could also use it for topwater fishing.  This post has me wondering. In these days of technology, why has nobody invented a variable speed baitcaster?"
262496,OhioFisherman,2008-10-28 11:21:00,6623,"Most of my reels are older, and run from about a 4.7 to 1 to a 6 to 1 retrieve, I do like the slower retrieves for crankbaits but didn`t have a problem with hooksets when I used them for flipping or pitching. At one time they were considered a fast retrieve."
