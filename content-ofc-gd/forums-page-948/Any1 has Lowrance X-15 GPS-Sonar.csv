If you have any technical questions or problems, I suggest you take your unit to Lowrance & Eagle Canada. Their services are good.  The address: Lowrance/Eagle Canada, 919 Matheson Blvd. E. Mississauga, Ontario"

262730,Terry,2008-10-28 19:56:00,14456,"most times when it reads the wrong depth on mine, it's because another high power unit is running and cause interference.  you can change the settings to help reject other signals or turn the other unit off or tell the guy in the other boat he is too close  if it loses the lock on the lake bottom it can also read the wrong depth, make sure the transducer is positioned  right and the bottom  of the transducer is clean that's all I can think of right now"
