262458,KelfuN,2008-10-28 03:33:00,246,"me and (okuma-sheffield) and a buddy hit up the eastern tribs on sunday risking the rivers might be full blown from the rain we got on friday, saturday. surprisingly, the water was PERFECT. nice greenish colour, current not too fast, and not much debris from the rainfall.  we showed up at about 6:30am and there were about 8-10 anglers fishing already. while setting up, those guys were pulling fish after another. i had no hits for a good solid hour, then it happened.   my first ever steelhead   then i tie on a new leader due to the fray it caused from the fight, but i insisted on using the exact same bait. about 10-15 drifts, at the same spot, my float sank fast!   she gave me a good 10 minute fight bringing me up and downstream. it was a fight and a half!   and the release.   it was definitely a day to remember, my first ever steelhead and a decent size one too. "
