Had a quick coffee, grabbed my gear and went out Muskie huntin' here on the river....  .....didn't take long before this fall fatty decided to  grab my crankbait and have some fun with me!....I landed her by 8:15AM....a few pike after that and then the winds picked up so I decided to head back to the house...    Sorry guys....decided to blur the background because of a few local lurkers that have been looking at this from another site"
