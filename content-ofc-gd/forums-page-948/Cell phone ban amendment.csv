But I would like to see a complete ban on cell phones for the people at sporting events who are in the TV camera's line of sight.  STAND UP AND WAVE ""Can you see me now?!"" ..... ""Can you see me now?!"" .... ""Can you see me now?!"" Sit down   hole and watch the game, it would be a real shame if you got hit in the head by a puck or baseball.  Ahhh, I feel better now, off to bed."
