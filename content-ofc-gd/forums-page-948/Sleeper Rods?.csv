I buy them when I can find them, they are a great trolling rod for muskies, and will handle all the big baits."
261863,GbayGiant,2008-10-26 18:09:00,1780,"Yeah, tough to beat the series one and lightning rods dollar for dollar, they are surprisingly tough and sensitive.  My good old custom G-loomis is by far my best though, not just because it was the most expensive it really is the best quality, but I'll still never buy another when you can get 3 or 4 really good rods for the same price and not worry as much when the snap or crack eventually."
262239,corvette1,2008-10-27 18:15:00,1765,i have 11 g-loomis 6shimano 4 diawa all shimano reels
262244,danbo,2008-10-27 18:42:00,2646,I bought a GLoomis GLX flyrod years back. I got it for $300 & it retailed for $800!! I was afraid to use it & ended up selling it..
262246,KelfuN,2008-10-27 18:51:00,246,i don't know if my okuma 13'6 guide select is a sleeper rod. got it for $150  i've tried other people's rods and nothing is comparable with how light the rod is. some people are saying its almost as light as the GLX.
261572,Rich,2008-10-25 21:30:00,3927,"I've switched almost all my rods over to Ugly Stik Lite rods the past 2 years. The braided line makes up for any deminished sensitivity (though they are pretty darn sensitive as it is). And for the 40 - 60 bucks, the rod will last you quite a long time!"
261602,kentooley,2008-10-25 22:48:00,208," It is sweet!!...and you know what ,I deserve it !!!!!When I go ,I will have nothing!!!I don't have kids...so CRAA gets whats left. Teach you're children well!  Cheers  Chris"
261660,Kerry,2008-10-26 00:49:00,383,"I've never used a berkley rod I didn't like.Matter of fact I still use my old 1 piece 6 1/2' Berkley Power pole for crankin and I have a 7' Series One spinning which is now 6' 8"" and even more sensitive than before.I highly recommend closing a door on the tip of one of these .I also have a 10 1/2' Shakesspeare Agility light action which I use for steel and also for panfish with a slipfloat.It's very sensitve on the river hits and has a great curve with a fish on but is not whippy.

261804,limeyangler,2008-10-26 15:01:00,5204,"i have 2 walmart $39 6'6"" spinning combos (mitchell), and one softer action $30 combo from a small tackle shop in Sioux Lookout. I use a 10' ugly stick light with a Shimano aero GTE-B Baitrunner reel for downrigging. I would like some better gear...lol...all donations greatfully accepted.   I would love to upgrade to the Fenwick/G Loomis rods...have held a few of those babies at tackle stores in Winnipeg.....TO DIE FOR!!! but i am prone to lose rods in the same way as JohnyB's ....i shut them in car doors, etc...etc...etc...I have have broken 4 rods this year alone!!! such a clutz.   will one day upgrade my reels...its just the ones i like are from England...and i dont have a credit card so ordering them is a bit of a pain. Thy are Shimano reels but the products in England are slightly different. I love rear drag reels...especially ones with the 'fightingdrag' adjustment too...You can get them over hear...its just that the one i have seen which is similar always have that really annoying bail arm trigger thing...WHY DO THEY PUT THAT THING THERE...??? is it just me or is that the most redundant piece of !@#$@ ever??!! Anyway ...would love one ...actually 4 of these...2 of the 2500 size for walleye and spinning, and 2 smaller 1500's for my icefishing rods.    What i want for Xmas"
