256776,ehg,2008-10-09 02:42:00,2666,"After reading a bunch of posts on curing roe, and brown and steelhead fishing in general i have become interested in dusting of the float equipment and giving the trout tribs a go later this fall. I haven't really done this much for 15 years or so but did a lot in the 80's/early 90's.  Despite the steelie jigs and pink trout worms i'm guessing roe is still the way to go. So there was a post on curing were you drew all the water out of the eggs and re-hydrated them when thawed. Removing the water allowed for real extended freezer life.  So i want to try this but need some roe. I've read about the fish cleaning house at the Credit or from a hatchery but am hoping someone can enlighten me so i don't waste too much time looking in the wrong places. PM's would be good if needed. Thanks in advance, ehg"
256783,Greencoachdog,2008-10-09 03:11:00,8163,Good luck on your quest for the Salmoon roe ehg!!! With all the Salmoon fishermen on this board I'm sure someone could be able to scrounge you up a skien or two!  I really enjoy your reports and am looking forward to seeing you with a Beauty Brown!!!

256895,ehg,2008-10-09 15:27:00,2666,"Thanks for replies, already read those reports just didn't think that charters and cleaning of fish was still occuring this late in the season. Don't really feel like salmon fishing in a trib hoping for a female( if they still bite now )  Really was curious if you can purchase eggs in bulk from hatchery. Just want to try this long lasting curing method. Maybe i'll join 'floatfishing.net' and ask the question there."
256896,Steel28,2008-10-09 15:34:00,160,Angling Specialties in Concord (Highway7/Keele) has some bulk hatchery roe.
256900,kemper,2008-10-09 15:38:00,2232,If I had some I would donate a skien no problem...Im going to be fishing all weekend and Im sure Ill run into a boot with some eggs on my line sooner or later. Dont really like to do it but I havent taken one in 3 years and I just ran out so its about that time.
