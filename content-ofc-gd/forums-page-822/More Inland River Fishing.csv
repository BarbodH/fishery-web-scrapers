358897,Rich,2009-07-06 10:55:00,3927,"Headed down to a couple of different spots yesterday evening with the girlfriend in search of these brown trout which litter the river. Yesterday turned out to be one of the slower days where I wished I had brought some worms to keep the interest. But we managed a few fish tossing spinners and crappie tubes around in various spots. Last trout was on a 3 1/4"" jerkbait.   ""I will eat your heart""   Fish On!   'Eh that's no trout   Blue Fox smashing bugle trout   Young fish love   WGSF!!!!!   Vantage point for WGSF hunting   Last trout of the day  Lo and behold, we went back to that spot from the other day and it was just full of fishermen. What a coincidence after my report was up that suddenly trout fishermen show up at a spot that's usually empty. I don't mind people fishing spots I reported about but sheesh, some acknowledgement wouldn't hurt. Like ""Hey Rich, how are ya?"" Poor antisocial lurkers. lol"
359017,jediangler,2009-07-06 17:40:00,1923,Nice report and pics Rich. I like that second last one. I agree that those other fishermen should at least bow   when fishing in your presence.
359041,ld17,2009-07-06 18:33:00,319,nice fish thanks for sharing your report
359046,lunkerbasshunter,2009-07-06 18:55:00,2585,nice report!  Looks like a good time!  Cheers!
359087,craigdritchie,2009-07-06 20:35:00,1586, All the more reason to not put your fav spots on the internet.
359282,Bly,2009-07-07 11:51:00,1556,Nice looking browns Rich
359297,highdrifter,2009-07-07 12:45:00,2534,"Nice trouts Rich.  But why you gill em like that?!  I'm assuming you keep those ones right?  Too bad about your spot getting popular..  Exposure mang, its over rated HD"
359361,Leecher,2009-07-07 15:27:00,7832,Great report and pics Rich Love your vantage point shot Nice trout!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman

You post pics of the spot and the fish, and then complain about ""anti-social lurkers"". I dont get it. No offence, but the only person to blame is yourself. BTW... your girl is hot........And she kisses fish! Thats what I call a woman!!!!"
359483,Rich,2009-07-07 19:56:00,3927,"Like I said, I don't care who the heck fishes that spot.. it's no secret. I can't believe I'm usually the only one there. But if somebody posted a spot on the internet like that and I visited and saw the poster there, I'd surely go say hello - and probably thank them for posting. That's what a fishing report is for is it not? But I guess not everyone believes in etiquette.  And yeah, she's a fishing hottie. Loves to fish everyday. Shares the same screwed up sense of humour as me. She's a catch!"
359491,fishermccann,2009-07-07 20:19:00,655,"So you are saying that you think all those people fishing that spot got it off this site, come on give me a break, this site is popular sure, but THAT popular I don't think so!"
359492,Rich,2009-07-07 20:21:00,3927,"From the 6 or 7 pm's I got from locals asking about it, I'd say yeah those guys probably read the report. I don't just post on one site by the way."
359496,fishermccann,2009-07-07 20:29:00,655,"We love your reports by the way, and the pics. are great , please keep them coming for those of us that can't get out every day (got to work), even if I am on  strike.  ( essential sevice)."
