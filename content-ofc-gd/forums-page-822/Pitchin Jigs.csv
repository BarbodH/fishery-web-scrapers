Saturday we pre-fished for the tourney on sunday in rondeau bay and I was flippin jigs most of the day with no luck. It could have been the color I was using but its all I have at the moment haha  I was using a green pumpin football head... I think it was 3/4 ounce with a rage tail craw trailer.  I found I was getting caught up in the weeds alot..... should I usea  different profile jig ?  What is your go to Jig/trailer when pitchin ?"

My profile of choice is a standard tear drop head 3/4oz green with a green and black skirt... but pretty much use a contrast colour plastic, like brown, reds and white.  Flooder heads and and swimmer flippin jigs work alright too for getting farther into cover, like under docks and into downed trees.  thick and heavy (slop) cover i tend to through weedless topwater stuff"
