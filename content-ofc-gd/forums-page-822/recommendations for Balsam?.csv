358888,cram,2009-07-06 07:14:00,1733,"Heading up to Balsam - any recommendations?  I am not at all familiar with the lake.  Not asking for your secret spots (thoughalways happy to hear about them), but hoping someone can point me in the direction of whatever spots are well known.  My friends will likely want to catch bass or pickerel.   I'll be pitching big spinnerbaits for muskies..."
358962,cram,2009-07-06 14:45:00,1733,"Or, does anyone know where i can find a good map or depth chart online?  There's one on fishhawk that is pretty popular but i have a feeling its kind of weak.  A depth chart would be fantastic."
358981,Victor,2009-07-06 15:46:00,1609,"I used to fish Balsam quite alot from shore but only maybe 2-3 times on the boat. Haven't really done well so can't give you any advice, but I know alot of people say that the area right out of the provincial park area is good."
358993,Rizzo,2009-07-06 16:12:00,4754,"lots of visible structure (weedbeds/edges) so not a tough place to at least find the ""community"" spots."
358997,davis,2009-07-06 16:26:00,128,head out from the provincial park and focus on the weedbeds...there's plenty of them...

359023,F_ast,2009-07-06 17:53:00,154,"If Muskie are your target, south bay is where i go.  We often hit walleye/ pickeral and 6lb bass fishing the weed line for Muskie in south bay.  All the weed lines are pretty distictive and typically there is a heavy break line from 16 FOW up to the weed line edge of 12FOW... these weeds stretch up to about 1-2ft under the surface.  Black/ Silver spinners and Yellow/ Bronze are good choices.  Plus anything perch colour"

359219,cram,2009-07-07 02:24:00,1733,"Any recommendations for the east side of the lake, just a couple of mins south of the marina?  Looks like we may be limited to canoes so won't be able to go very far."
359328,F_ast,2009-07-07 14:17:00,154,by marina do you mean Rosedale?  That hole channel is pretty good for bass and walleye.  There are a few nice shoals and weedlines right near the mouth of the river there.
