After getting up to the cottage on Friday afternoon, the wind was pretty strong and the waves were whipping up. I knew that this was going to be a busy weekend on Rice as the CSFL was having there 2 day tournament running. Normally the start from Bewdley but this year they started from Hastings. I thought that was cool as I never ventured to Bewdley to catch any tournament action. Friday nights sunset was nice as usual.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-07-05  Saturday morning was pretty cool and the wind was very strong and the waves where once again whipping up wth some small whitecaps. Just after 7am the first wave of boats came thundering through my area and then again 15 and 30 minutes later.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-07-05  I can recall seeing one boat in particular get airborn and I thought it was going to flip.  I didn't venture out to fish on Saturday as fishing was tough due to the high winds and waves. This is what some of the anglers said when I talked to them from my dock. The ones I talked to said action was slow and some caught nothing to that point in time. I went for a drive to Hastings and saw all the boats in a line come in around 3 pm. Pretty cool sight but I forgot my camera.  Saturday nights sunset was nice but still didn't venture out. Casted my Clackin' Rap off my dock for a bit and managed to land a Rock Bass.

Here are a few shots from some of the action. Asked a boat about day 1's leading weight and they said it was 19 lbs, WOW.

I was casting in about 9 FOW and all of a sudden I get a hit but I miss it. I see the flash swim away slightly so I quickly pitch underhand to the same spot and as soon as it hits the water I see it just engulf the swimbait. Turns out to be a nice 17""  Smallmouth that weighed in at 2.12 lbs. What made it more gratifying was the fact that there were 2 tournament boats right beside my and I was proud to catch something in front of them.
