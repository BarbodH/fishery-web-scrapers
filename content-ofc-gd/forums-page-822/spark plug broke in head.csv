359167,Bitsmith2k,2009-07-07 00:37:00,396,"so i was giving my motor the once over before my weeked trip to kipawa, and checking the plugs, both of which were fine.. so i put them back in, top plug goes in just peachy.. bottom plug goes in and as i'm torquing it instead of the wrench clicking, the plug snapped.. i was expecting to see the porcelain cracked.. instead the porcelain dropped off, still attached to the bolt part (sorry not up to date with my plug anatomy)..  i can take a couple pics when i get to work tomorrow..  so left in the head of the engine was just the outside of the lower part of the plug.. no threads above the head to grab or anything.. after my initial panic attack i sat down with a long set of hemostats and turned it back out.. it wasnt stuck or anything came right out without any real force..  my question, how can i tell if the threads are frigged up in the head?  thanks guys mike"
359173,Gerritt,2009-07-07 00:42:00,6129,Mike.... this may be obvious...  uhmmmm... try and hand tighten a new plug into it?  G
359177,Bitsmith2k,2009-07-07 00:45:00,396," thanks g, actually didnt think about it.. more or less was initially happy to get the thing out.  i'll give that a shot tomorrow..  mike"

359192,Raf,2009-07-07 01:21:00,3495,..and if they are messed up look up heli-coil but i'd recommend if you're not experienced you have a machine shop do it.

Check the threads and inside the cylinder using the flashlight for any loose metal. With the other plug removed you can by hand turn the fly wheel to get the piston on top.  Good Luck Fishing,  Bob"
