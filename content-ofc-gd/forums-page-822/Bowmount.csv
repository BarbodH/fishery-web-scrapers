What are my chances of installing a bowmount on this boat with out any huge alterations to the bow?  The upward angle kind of tells me it wont be easy, but I have no experience with bowmounts to know any better.  Hard to tell by the picture but there is a triangular bow plate there big enough to mount the Motorguide Wireless trolling motor that I have in mind.    Look forward to your input, Thanks in advance.  MB"

359373,muskeybugged,2009-07-07 16:04:00,282,So regardless I'd have to find a way to level that out I take it?
359378,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-07 16:16:00,1022,"you definetely want it to sit level, or as close to level as possible"
