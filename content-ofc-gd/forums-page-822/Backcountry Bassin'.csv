358878,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-06 04:09:00,0,"All day today all I could think about was fishin' (like today was any different than yesterday) so I figured I had to get out and wet a line.  I grabbed my father in law and headed north out of the sault at about 3pm.  Finished portaging the canoe at around 5:00.  This lake is real weird in that it is surrounded by trout lakes, and looks like a speck lake itself...Definitely not a typical smallie lake...  By 5:30 we hadn't hit a fish yet and found ourselves fighting the wind with the canoe...  We tried the opposite shore and hit some good fish.  Most of the smallies were right up in the trees within a few feet of the shore...very brookie like... By the time all was said and done we boated 13.  These are the best fish of the night.  The rest averaged about 2 pounds.    "

358984,troutologist,2009-07-06 15:56:00,951,Good job buddy. There some fat fish in there for sure. See any pike when you were there?  Was the fly hatch going on or too cold?
