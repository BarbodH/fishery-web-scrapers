So we headed out a little later than usual, the sun was already high, so I  was not expecting much action today.  After 5 tiny WGSF or so he got a little bored and said that he wanted to catch some bass.  3 lb on the digital scale   2.5 lb   He still out fished me, I guess I should listen to him more often  Jose"
