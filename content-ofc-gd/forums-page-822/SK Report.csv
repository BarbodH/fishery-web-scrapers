Known for Perch and small Pike, I was hoping for the odd Walleye.  There was only one other vehicle parked on this small Lake so I was almost alone.  However two Girls showed up looking for their men and since I was about to go out, I offered to pass the message.   I found them at the very end of the Lake and they were quite disappointed that they were summond.  They said that they got some Bites in the area so I decided to drop anchor.  Soon as I lowered my leach I got my biggest pickerel of the season.          Since I haven't posted awhile Id like to say Hi to Coach and ROY     It really got Dark fast and it started to Rain so I decided to head back in.  Also my little Buddy was getting impatient    Beautiful Calm water but unfortunately I heard the noise of chopping and Chainsaw in the Bush.  Hopefully not a Cabin.      I also passed this memorial on the shore close to a point.  Don't know the story but my guess a drowning because it was in an Isolated spot.  It could also been a makeshift camp site.     Saturday I hooked up with JohnAB for the first time and had probably my second best ever Pickerel outing.  I'm looking forward of his report on his SK Report as he has fished several places and hopefully save the best pictures for his report.  Here's one of a good eater pike.  Ill wait for Johns report before posting any other Pics.  Had a great time with John.  Thanks  lets do it again.  "
