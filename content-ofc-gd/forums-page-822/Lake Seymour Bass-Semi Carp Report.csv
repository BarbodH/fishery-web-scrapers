I had a great time fishing a variety of techniques for bass both deep and shallow, weedy and rocky waters along side 3 nights carp fishing off the dock. Techniques i used out in deep water on the edges of the weed beds were tube jigs(green), here are some pictures of bass->  I caught a lot of average sized bass with only a few over 2lbs. The biggest being around 3lbs.  My brother with a nice largemouth on the tube   Short fat bass      Caught a surprise Crappie out there...a good size for the lack of crappie in the area there this year  Some friends of mine invited me out on there brand new Princecraft boat..   I caught the first fish in there boat.  Another nice bass my brother caught, he loves to fish   I threw around some other baits both of shore and out in the boat including the X-Rap Shad, and the new bait the Shad Shallow. Also, my favorite bait the skitter pop nailed some great bass!  2lb+ Smallmouth on a popper  The big boy of the trip   at least a 3lb largemouth on the skitter pop  Nice bass in the rain-with my new rain suit    Bigger rockbass on a buzzbait  Small largemouth on the Chigger Craw      A self yet blurry shot of a nice perch and a nice crappie off the dock 10""+ Perch   And another great crappie  Perch on the Shad Shallow  lol, here's a shot of me after i had to walk through the mud to retrieve my popper from that wood across the water. Was NOT going to loose a $8 lure.  And a pic of a bass on the X-Rap Shad   Last but not least my 3 carp that I caught(One being a upgrade for our team-24.5->29!)  24"" Carp, 10.4lbs(all caught on corn with split shot and circle hooks)  22"" 9.12lbs  And my PB Carp 29"" long and 11.8lbs!    This must be my biggest report yet, as said before we had a good time and even the rain did not hold me up. Also, the new shades worked amazingly, it's amazing how much more i can see in the water with polarized shades, strongly reccamened to anglers wanting to get some.  Thanks and good night OFC!  MTBF"

358819,BillM,2009-07-06 01:18:00,17367,Nice report Mike!!  Good to see you tried out a couple of new techniques...  Bass are always suckers for tube jigs!
358832,hammercarp,2009-07-06 01:54:00,964,Great report. My family has had a cottage on Lake Seymour since 1967. You remind me of the great fishing I had over the years. Some of the best LM bass fishing in Ontario.
358833,jediangler,2009-07-06 02:03:00,1923,"Great report and pics Mike. Seymour is where I caught my biggest smallmouth bass and my biggest carp. Good to see you fishing with your little brother, you'll have a fishing partner for life."

358851,Victor,2009-07-06 02:32:00,1609,"You certainly lived up to the name of ""MTBF"" lol !!!  Great report and pics, i have been wanting to find a place/cottage where I can go out for bass/panfish during the day, and when bedtime rolls around, I can take out my carp gear and fish for them while i sleep lol. That seems like the ideal lake for me!"

358879,bassin,2009-07-06 04:11:00,15,"Year before, Narrowed down two cottages for purchase. My major purpose to purchase a cottage is for fishing. One is on Lake Semyour and another is on Bay of Quinte. Decided to go Bay of Quinte.  Wonder whether it was a better choice."
