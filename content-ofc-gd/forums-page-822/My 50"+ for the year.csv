357667,splashhopper,2009-07-02 02:16:00,2931,"Nice fish,,,,,  No details"
357672,cram,2009-07-02 02:27:00,1733,Wow. Beautiful fihs.  Details?  What did you catch her on?  Good fight?
357680,cityfisher,2009-07-02 02:56:00,959,great pic.. other than the odd gray stuff happening and a great writeup:)
357681,Handlebarz,2009-07-02 02:57:00,3790,congratz on a very nice looking big girl I dont blame ya for keeping it to your self not every one has to be told about well maybe a lure unless its a top secret one LOL.  Cheers Mike
357682,SBCregal,2009-07-02 03:02:00,688,"you could tell me where, when, how, what lure, depth, and any other possible info and i still wont get into any fish...nice job!"
357685,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-02 03:06:00,2038,A Magnificant Muskie right there.....
357687,dada2727,2009-07-02 03:12:00,108,"That doesn't look like a kawartha muskie, you don't see too many of them over 50.  Beauty fish though wherever it came from.  Too bad its tail fin got all ripped up like that.  You should invest in a Beckman Pen Fin saver, money well spent IMO.  Just for curiousities sake, why the grey-out on the boat?"
357688,Raf,2009-07-02 03:12:00,3495,nice job & fish porn Larry.. all we need to know is that it was caught.
357705,MuskyBill,2009-07-02 04:18:00,311,Beauty speciman right there. How FAT will she be in 4 months!!!!!

357720,Badger Shark,2009-07-02 08:15:00,291,"Very nice fish, looks like an Ottawa river ski to me.  Beauty."

357775,muskeybugged,2009-07-02 14:44:00,282,"Like all good porn (fish porn or otherwise) we don't watch it for the story line!  Great fish!  Little Curious George on the boat blur though? Cheating on your usual fishing buddy, my guess..."
