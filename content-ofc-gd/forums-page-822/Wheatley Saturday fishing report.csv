Did you notice the big pile of sand? Well the night befor there was such a violent thunderstorm that they had to get a front loader in to remove the sand from the launch ramp. I had to wonder how so much sand came into that small launch ramp but if the storm was that bad then I am just glad no one was on the lake.  We went 5 for 6 but the fish were not turned on, marked lots straight south in 35 to 52 fow. We caught 2 in the top 10 feet and the rest of the fish were 30 feet down. 2 fish were caught on greasy chicken wing, two were caught on watermelon and one on jerry lee. Snapper and Musky Torpedo's were hot. We also caught a ton of silver bass when we put our lines deeper then 30'.  I think on the next warm up the fish will turn on in Wheatley. Thunderstorm the night befor could have been a factor."

I hear those rigs can kill people at the side of the boat when the fish lets go and the person gets a 10oz unit in the head!!!!. INCOMING!!!  That was my first concern and it seems as though it has happened. Although no one was injured but your product was quickely tossed to the way side."
216342,Slyatv,2008-06-17 02:56:00,45,Why would someone hook a chicken wing on a hook ... to catch a cougar ! NOW that could be a reel spinner ! All technologies need a trial and break something phaze . Down riggers are safer..
