I fish below the dam for hour upon hour, not a hit. I see people fishing all day, getting nada. I finally caught a 3lb bass after dark somewhere above the dam with a surface popper. Can't believe that place gets so much hype.  - just a heads up, many of the conservation areas advertise fishing but often fishing can be hideous there (maybe too much pressure), the more rugged/quiet the area the better!  On another note, I'm looking for waters I can wade in (usually go to Caledonia), I hear the Speed River is a good place to wade but I can't find the access points, seems to be mostly private. It is supposed to be a shallow type of river good for wading, does anyone know access points for it? Or other rivers that are good for wading?  Thanks"
