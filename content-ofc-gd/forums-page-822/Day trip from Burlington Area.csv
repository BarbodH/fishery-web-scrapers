357863,heri0n,2009-07-02 18:29:00,27,"I'm wondering what's a good location for a fishing day trip from the Burlington area where you can catch a decent sized edible fish?  Seems like most of you guys catching nice fish are doing it up north where there are a lot of decent sized lakes. I usually go fishing in Bronte Creek since it's close to my house, but right now it's mostly just small mouth bass and smaller panfish.  Thanks!"
