Boaters are encouraged to safely dispose of their unwanted, expired marine flares at any of the 165 OPP detachments in Ontario, including those in Grey and Bruce counties.  The OPP will turn the expired flares over to Transport Canada's Office of Boating Safety after which they will be taken to a certified disposal site.  The drop off will run the week of Aug. 1 -8."
359406,Twocoda,2009-07-07 17:55:00,4130,i already disposed of mine on Canada day ....
359410,4thgen,2009-07-07 18:10:00,157, I would too.  That would be like throwing away fireworks!
359415,BITEME,2009-07-07 18:28:00,1968,Masons chandelry in Mississauga take them as well  Here is a thought though the law states that they can be no older then 4 years from manufacture it does not mean you cant keep them on your boat in all reality they could last another 4 years or they might not work after 4 BUT the older flares also come in handy as back ups more signalling power you have to use a bit of common dog as to when enough is enough but the older ones can still be useful  My 2 cents
359424,Landlocked,2009-07-07 18:42:00,171,I agree...just make sure you have the current flares handy and separated from expired for those spot checks.
359466,aplumma,2009-07-07 19:25:00,6896,You nailed BM...  They found that the flares that are kept out of the humidity have a high success rate even if they are expired. I have 18 flares on board and hope I never need one of them but when the weather is bad and viability is minimum the more the merrier I say.   Art
