358883,Sawyer,2009-07-06 04:37:00,48,"I have a sqaure back fibre glass canoe and its been with me for 11 years now - I have both a trolling motor and 2 hp for it.  Back then it was in the $500 range and i'm sure their much more expensive now.  I suggest you continue to save your money and get a quality canoe - after all you'll be spending hours upon hours in it....and believe me, it will be worth the wait.  -Sawyer"
