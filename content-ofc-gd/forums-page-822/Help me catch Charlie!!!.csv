358138,blaque,2009-07-03 11:40:00,2419,"You also may want to try some live bait, only leave whatever it is naturally bouyant. No weight on the presentation. The weight of  the crawler, or leech, or crawdad should be enough to cast if your line is light enough. Something about it falling naturally in the water toward the bottom just gives the fish goosebumps sometimes lol"
358265,charlesn,2009-07-03 18:55:00,551,"At the risk of offending some of the previous posters, I'd say to try to catch it without resorting to live bait to make it more of an accomplishment.  I think it can be caught, but those bigger fish are opportunity feeders and they do not eat every day, you'll probably have to trigger it.  If you catch it at the right time with the right presentation, you can trigger a strike I bet.  A fish big enough to comfortably fit most of a 1.25 lber (12-13"" fish) inside its mouth is probably pushing 7 lbs.  A veritable giant.  Maybe try longer casts and baits the little ones are not going to be able to eat like a 12-16 inch worm.  I also like the night fishing person's suggestion.  I think maybe some of these giant fish eat only at night which is why they are caught less frequently.  The ones that eat all day every day usually end up in a pan of hot grease or oil."

358360,Kerry,2009-07-04 02:13:00,383,Try a large Shad Rap in the bass/pumpkinseed colour and use a very erratic retrieve to simulate a bass that's been caught and being reeled in.THEN show us a picture of your released hog! Kerry
358371,Kenny G,2009-07-04 02:53:00,118,A buddy of mine caught one of the biggest smallies I have ever seen in the evening. On what you ask? A Jitterbug and a worm. Kenny G.
358433,bucketmouthjohnny,2009-07-04 12:03:00,115,No one said a double buzz bait? how about a topwater frog? not sure the type of structure in the pond but i love a spook for big fish. only if you know how to use it though.
358476,River Rat,2009-07-04 15:16:00,161,"My buddy had a pond in Lakefield when we were kids and """"WALTER"" was the resident bully bass in his pond. They caught all the smaller ones but Walter would only look, not bite. I came up for a weekend and threw everything I had...but no live bait. There is always a greater chance of a gut hook with live bait so I didn't want that. I crept up on my belly on the sunday morning and watched him for a couple hours. There were lots of minnows in the pond but Walter was eating terrestrials....I collectled up grass hoppers and got up wind and threw them in the water. Walter loved to eat them....I had my fly rod with me but no flys that looked like a grass hopper.  I did have a popper (old canadian tire poppers) that was painted like a bumble bee.......I tied it on a stood way back and launched a blind cast with the wind....slowly crept up and just as my eyes focussed on the bug, SLURP!! Walter was on.......That was over 20 years ago and we still talk about that weekend to this day evertime we see each other.  If it's a pond in a field, I will bet they are eating lots of bugs....try fly fishing for them.  RR"

358710,gone_fishin,2009-07-05 16:39:00,481, i'd say get a small-ish musky lure in a bass pattern... maybe in an 8 or 9 inch size... mimick a distressed bass... a jerkbait maybe???
358721,Rich,2009-07-05 17:39:00,3927,Live 6 inch chub minnows
358966,nancur373,2009-07-06 15:16:00,1211,lots of good ideas there guys. hoping to get out during the evening some nights this week .
359133,nancur373,2009-07-06 22:59:00,1211,Bought some lures at BPS today...$45.00 worth. Not gonna say which ones...lol. But the one that works will get the right guy out with me...haha.   Curt
359138,e-z-out,2009-07-06 23:24:00,1052,Curt do i need to come down and show you how it's done? lol

357937,nancur373,2009-07-02 21:44:00,1211,"Both Saturday and Yesterday my friend and I went fishing in a little bass pond. Lots of 1 - 2 lbers. But there are three huge hawgs cruising. The biggest being Charlie...lol. Threw everything in the tacklebox at these 3 for two days without any luck. Jigs, senkos, swimbaits, frogs poppers, spinnerbaits, spinners, spoons, cranks, jerks, bucktails, etc. only thing left i can think of is minnows. Untill...my buddy was fighting a smaller bass Charlie came up and just inhaled the guy. Only the tail left sticking out. I was like 'Holy cow' He's not an experienced bass fisher so I told him to let Charlie take it on the freespool for a bit then try to set the hook. On a 7' medium heavy spinniing rod with a decent reel it just pulled the maxed out drag. Couldn't get it to turn then he spit out the other bass. We pulled the other guy in and realized it was not a tiny guy at all. He weighed in at 1lb 14oz on the digital scale. So what size is Charlie?!!!!!. Anyhoo, later in the day both other big two did the same thing with tiny guys. They only get excited when another bass is in distress. Only other thing that they showed a lillte bit of interest in was musky lures but nothing close to a bite. Any one got any ideas of a rig or bait to entice these guys to bite? Any help would be appreciated. You can pm me if you don't want it on here.  p.s. If you give me one that works there will be an invitation to come fishing in it for you...lol  Thanks,  Curt"
357940,misfish,2009-07-02 21:50:00,29133,Small ponds like yer fishing.Hit it at dusk and use top water.
357945,l2p,2009-07-02 22:01:00,346,"go back to basics, try float fishing with a big fat juicy night crawler.... ofcourse your prolly gona have to cast infront of the cruising bass cause the smaller ones will definatly get to the worm before the big ones do. good luck!"
357957,nancur373,2009-07-02 22:22:00,1211,tried nightcrawlers. haven't been there at dusk though.
357958,Burning Babies,2009-07-02 22:23:00,150,"Stalk the fish.  Figure out her patterns (it's almost certainly a she), and approach her range stealthily.  Try moving in, exploring the area with a couple baits, and then backing out.  Don't let her know you're there.  Don't assume she's not there just because you can't see her; if you can't, it might be because she's in ambush looking to feed.  Try again at multiple point in the day over multiple days.  Certainly, big baits can work, but sometimes it just takes a careful natural presentation at the right time."

357968,cram,2009-07-02 22:41:00,1733,Hit the bait shop.  Get some bigger minnows.  Have fun.  Rinse and repeat.
357983,Victor,2009-07-02 23:26:00,1609,"Sounds like they like the bigger baits? And since you said muskie size lures worked ok, why not keep at it with big size lures?"
357989,misfish,2009-07-02 23:54:00,29133,"  DO NOT, DO THE ABOVE. UNLESS THEY ARE FROM THAT BODY OF WATER."
357990,bullybass,2009-07-02 23:59:00,144,If they like the bass so much how bout something like this? My wife would kill me if I spent that kinda money on a lure but... hey who knows!!!  good luck to you!!  http://www.shoptimusprime.com/sites/4/imag...epa3asepe8y.jpg  http://www.castaicswimbait.com/Rock-Hard-Baby-Bass/8/
357991,johnnyb,2009-07-03 00:00:00,3413,Hit the pet shop.  Get some mice.  Have fun.    Kidding...of course.  The dusk idea sounds about right...we'd love to see a pic if you ever nail..er...catch Charlie
357995,nancur373,2009-07-03 00:06:00,1211,tried that...nothing
357996,bucktail,2009-07-03 00:08:00,1857,Tell me where it is and Ill show you!!!   ;-)
357998,cram,2009-07-03 00:10:00,1733,zara spook is the best *big fish bait* i know. You might try that.  To charlie will look like one of the distressed bass.
358007,Cudz,2009-07-03 00:22:00,2652,"Throw him something he may never have seen before, like a beaver bait (creature bait).  Or try a different technique like shaky head fishing. Get a good shaky head jig and a 5-7 incvh shaky head or finess worm and give it a go. Seeing as this bass is trying to eat a 1+pound bass I might go with bullybass' suggestion and throw a big swimbait.  Buy a storm 10"" kickin minnow and throw that.  They have great action and only cost about 7 bucks."
358008,Bassaholic,2009-07-03 00:23:00,74,If she keeps chomping down on smaller bass its pretty obvious...you need to do like a fly fisherman and match the hatch the best you can...    Or if there's any bluegill in the pond then I'm sure she'd kill one of these too...  
358045,nancur373,2009-07-03 01:52:00,1211,does Bass Pro or Lebaron's sell the baits you guys put in pictures? I'll need to go shopping next week.

358120,paulyboy83,2009-07-03 09:40:00,54,"The only thing that is going to work is a large minnow.  I had the same dilemna at a local gravel pit.  Two big bruisers and a whole lot of little ones swimming around.  Threw everything in the box at the big ones and they wouldn't even look at it.  I think the water is too clear, and they can see every detail of what you throw in there.  I caught a 8 inch baby bass and the same thing happened.  The big one went nuts and inhaled the smaller one.  Eureka! the light bulb went on.  Went to a a local creek, caught some big chub and threw one of them in and the battle was on.  She was 5 lbs 2oz!   I named her Big Momma and have caught her every year for the past 3 years to see how big she gets each year.  PB"
358127,ChrisK,2009-07-03 11:06:00,2772,"I would go with the live frog idea....They are usually easy to find and catch on location.... Many gravel pits around London have stocked bass in them as well and they seem to love live bait....I personally go after them with a fly rod patterning the food they eat....Mice,frogs,dragon flies,small snakes ect.....Gosslings and birds are a little harder to tie so I don't bother with those patterns"
