I have not had much success in the morning after first light, late afternoon and evening have been best this year so far.  I have heard that a Smallies metabolism picks up as the day goes on therefore they feed more later in the day.  Any theories or experiences would be appreciated.  Paul"

It's funny how you can just watch the bite tail off more and more the higher the sun gets.  By noon it's Miller time!  If I can't get the the river by first light, I don't even like going."

359114,Rich,2009-07-06 21:46:00,3927,Always did best from about 6pm til dark. However my biggest Grand bass have always been caught during mid-day.
359151,ironstone74,2009-07-06 23:44:00,201,"Interesting, I guess there are several good windows for hitting fish on the Grand.  I must say I like the idea of first light the most.  I'm a Steelheader at heart and first light is the only way to go for Steelies. I hope to get out one evening this week an catch one of the monsters released from the derby at Bingemans over the weekend!!!"

359169,ironstone74,2009-07-07 00:38:00,201," I fish from Kaufman's flats in Waterloo down to the Freeport hospital/King St. area.   Lots of good stretches of fishable water, good option is to rent a canoe and float on down!  I wet wade in my wading books and a pair of shorts which is fun, but takes more time to cover water.
