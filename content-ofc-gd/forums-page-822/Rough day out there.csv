I figure we were lucky given the forecasts .... and here is the pic for the day ...I put the rain suit on to keep the rain away (it worked) ... that and because it was QUITE chilly out there  "
359205,Rizzo,2009-07-07 01:45:00,4754,"looks a little choppy! nice looking pike, but based on the size of your net you're ready for something much bigger!"
359208,camillj,2009-07-07 01:54:00,1988,Yep we were dragging some pretty healthy hardware around .. I like the big net because I can let the fish stay in the water while messing with cameras and pliers and cutters when necessary .. it also gives the fish a chance to revive without being held before release ... that net can hang over the side of the boat and keep a 40+ fish fully in the water boatside ...no hands ...
359209,johnnyb,2009-07-07 01:58:00,3413,Nice work! Definitely better than sitting at home
359229,Joey,2009-07-07 02:58:00,9122,"Yep, looks a bit wavy to me.  But you stuck it out and were rewarded, way to go.  Joey"
359262,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-07 05:46:00,0,"once in a while you have to be the ""crazy friggin' guy out fishing""... good job sticking it out!"
359266,solopaddler,2009-07-07 09:33:00,8605,That there's a walleye chop son. Nice little pike though.
359278,Bly,2009-07-07 11:36:00,1556,   Complete agreement with both statements      Nice looking pike.
