359317,LucG,2009-07-07 14:02:00,779,When on ofncommunity.com the back button in my browser's menu bar never works on the first click. I allways have to click twice (not necessarily double click). I've never had this issue anywhere else but on this site. Does anyone else have this problem?
359326,Bitsmith2k,2009-07-07 14:16:00,396," i normally use the dropdown at the bottom of the page to go back.. if you click the down arrow (in ie) beside the fwd arrow, you can see that an extra page actually in the history..  googleadd.g.doubleclick.net/cpa"

359336,LucG,2009-07-07 14:37:00,779," That's odd eh?  Well, like Lakshore, I just wanted to make sure it wasnt my computer."
359342,blaque,2009-07-07 14:46:00,2419,"yea, this happens on my home computer, not at work though"
359367,Bitsmith2k,2009-07-07 15:56:00,396," i've noticed, at least for me, the only two skins that mess up the back button are IPB 2.2.0 Default, and OFC Club..  the very bottom adds are not being displayed.."

359376,Leecher,2009-07-07 16:08:00,7832,"Download latest version of Firefox, install and problem solve.  I did that for my home PC Leechman"
359379,Twocoda,2009-07-07 16:17:00,4130,if firefox isnt your cup of tea...you coud also try flock...ive been running it for about three months now and have never had a problem....Jobbs fixes Bates's problems again ...IE 8 is a disaster in my mind
