359006,Joey,2009-07-06 17:04:00,9122," That would be fantastic Aaron.  It sure has been a long time.  Nice of you to crawl out of the woodwork  Thanks for the replies everyone, back at work today and still happy about the whole week and the G2G.  Wonder how long that till last  Joey"
358592,Joey,2009-07-05 00:34:00,9122,"Another very successful June Lakair G2G in our opinion and we had a fabulous time.  It was great seeing everyone again and we already can't wait until next year.  We arrived Friday noonish and set up our ""home"" for the week.    We saw alot of smiling, happy faces when we arrived.  Lew and Bassbastermike had been up earlier in the week and looked quite relaxed.      Bill and Peter looked even more relaxed      Maureen made it up again this year, along with Leah and Wayne, which was a nice surprise.        Patsy and Rich made the long haul aswell, and it was great to see you two!!!  Return PM on its way    Not sure what Paul is ready to do here, but hopefully he's going to chop firewood.    Kevin joined us for awhile.    Toby was the resident Go Boy this year, and a fine job he did.  Cool Australian accent too!!    Chris made it up with his darling Brook, I belive ChrisK tagged along for the ride.      Our fearless leader TJ.    Moi, with my Executioner mosquito killer in hand.    This is a great picture of Monique and TJ!!    Pete forgot his regular earrings so he had to make do with these lures    An even bigger surprise was Jil101 (Joyce) showed up for a few hours Friday night.  Was great to see you again Joyce (I know you're lurking)    The Group Shot.    The Pike tournament was on Saturday and we had the pleasure of Roy joining us in our boat.    Paul ended up winning biggest fish in the tourney, a nice surprise, and won a float suit compliments of Peter (Biteme).  Thanks Pete, I'll enjoy my new suit  Here is the winning fish.    The ceremonies began with TJ giving a touching speech.    He had everyone's almost undivided attention.      My new suit    The trophy for most inches went to Joyce's nephew, Dan I believe his name is?    Bly snagged an awesome musky cradle off the prize table.  Great pick Carole!!!    Spiel picked this neat lure up.    Love the t-shirt Leah.    John trying to make a decision.    Payback are a B..... eh Wayne .  Should have bought a Chev     After Saturday, the weather was not nice most of the time, but at least it was not stinkin hot!!!  Sunday ChrisK and I went out in the rain for a fish and I ended up getting 3 pike, this one being the largest.  Thanks for taking me Chris, I enjoyed our chat and fish together and thanks for letting us use your boat Spiel.  Much appreciated.    Where is that wascally wabbit!!!!!     Saw some turkey vulchers picking at some kind of meal, I think a rabbit.    A few storms brewed up too.      Zack ditched the mohawk and went for dreads this time.    Paul and I pounded all the bays for musky the rest of the time after all the OFC'rs left.  Rained mostly but there was one sunny day.  My hands have blisters and cuts and my entire body aches, but that's what its all about.  This little guy came up to the boat to check us out one day.    I caught about 40 pike throughout the week (Paul not so much ha ha), but pike are pike and I didn't bother with pics.  Paul did catch two very nice pickerel while musky fishing, in the middle of the day too, but alas they were in the slot and back they went.      Irishfield, is that you??    This plane buzzed very close over the boat.     Each night we went pickerel fishing, and I got a few, but Paul can apparently only catch them in the middle of the day while musky fishing, so caught a bass instead.      Hair by Mercury!!!    One day while pounding a small bay, Paul raised an enormous musky using one of my homemade bucktails.  All I heard was OH MY GOD and took a look and this thing had surfaced and was following his lure, but he ran out of line and started doing the figure 8 and it slowly lost interest.  It was huge with a massive head and a large broad back.  Definately well over 55 inches.  Well that got us pounding even harder and we didn't even go pickerel fishing that night, just back to camp to eat and then back to the bay.  But she never surfaced again.  While trying to find her I ended up catching two very nice musky tho, which definately made the week for us.  What a great fight.  Here they are in all their glory.  This one was 35 inches.    This second one was 36 inches, a bit skinnier tho.    One of the revival release shots.    We pounded some more for the beast and Paul finally said that was it, we were heading back (it was yesterday late, our last night).  He gave it one more cast and caught this, a nice 24.5 inch pickerel.  Once again, on a musky lure LOL.    A few sunsets.        Until we meet again!!!!!!!  A big thanks to TJ and Monique once again, and to Kevin and Leslie for having us unrully bunch.  And Spiel, your Musky Rods ROCK!!!  They were great and we used them all week.  Cheers,  Joey"

358663,Rich Clemens,2009-07-05 11:54:00,3131,"Super report Joey and sorry we missed saying ""See ya next year""  (got your PM).  There is a super tanker out there some where. I saw her once and I think Cliff/Bly actually had her hooked for a period of time.   (assuming this is the same fishing making her appearance to all of us).   I went back a few times, at different times of the day, but one show is all I got.  She's gonna give someone one heck of a thrill one of these days.  Maybe it will be an OFC'r and we'll get to see a pic of how big she really is.  Congrats on catching the two.   Those are just the warm-ups for September.    We'll be on the French in early September, from the 5th to the 11th, so I'm not sure if that will coincide with the fall GTG or not.  If it does, maybe we'll pop up for a bit to say Hi.  If not - we'll see ya next year.    We may alter our plans a bit to stay just a bit longer next year.  Patsy had to get back early this year due to other vacations in her department, or we would have stayed a few more days."
358664,bigugli,2009-07-05 12:03:00,6138,It looked like you had a really great time up there. Great location and great fishing.
