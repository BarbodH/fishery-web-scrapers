Just would like to know what the weeds are like right now, is there lot's of floating weeds?  Going to bring just a few frogs and maybe a jig or two with me to fish thick stuff.  Thanks for any news, MTBF"
359100,Paully,2009-07-06 21:10:00,712,Bring a rake!
359113,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-06 21:46:00,3761, Say no more!
359134,rbaquial,2009-07-06 23:02:00,968,MTBF - Are you gonna be fishing off the bridge on HWY7? I may see you there this Saturday!
359183,kemper,2009-07-07 01:09:00,2232,"slammin last weekend mike.  Spent 20 minutes on shore then 30 minutes in a kayak and ended up with a 15"" two 17"" and a fatty 18"" that was pressing the 4 lb mark...mega fat!  All on a spook...to let you know how much  I love spooks I actually have a 'spook' dedicated rod."
359194,cpguy29,2009-07-07 01:22:00,148,  Bring a weedwacker!
359201,Paully,2009-07-07 01:36:00,712,  ... or just some rolling papers
359217,rbaquial,2009-07-07 02:24:00,968, Hahahahahaha..... Awesome!
359292,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-07 12:40:00,3761," I think the weeds may be a little thick for a spook at the locations I'm thinking about then again, I'm not to good at fishing them. I got this Heddon Zara Spook Puppie(small spook). I could toss it around but I think I'm going to fish a popper and frogs.  Wish me luck, might not be this weekend now due to a trip to Lindsay to look for hosing but soon enough I'll get out there.  MTBF"
359296,Beans,2009-07-07 12:45:00,3339,Lots of hosers in Lindsay...  Sorry...couldn't resist...
359306,ricoboxing,2009-07-07 13:19:00,398,bring weedless topwaters and you should be able to nail some bass. theyre starting to get pretty thick near shore now.
