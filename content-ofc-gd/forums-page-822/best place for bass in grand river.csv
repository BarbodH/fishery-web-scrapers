358873,n8tivebigguy,2009-07-06 03:46:00,30,Hi i was just looking for some good spots to hook into some bass in or around caledonia area of the grand? What kind of baits do they like? Any help would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance.
358885,KelfuN,2009-07-06 04:50:00,246,"I've fished the Grand all summer last year, you MUST do the leg work.. the dam at Caledonia is full of smallies, walleye, cats, and carps.. another good access point is York, lots of fish held below the rapids"
358893,Rich,2009-07-06 10:38:00,3927,"The river is loaded with smallies anywhere above Dunnville. Spinners, small jerkbaits, grubs, tubes... will all work."
358991,charlied,2009-07-06 16:04:00,584,float fish with worms works best for me!
359013,Hooked,2009-07-06 17:28:00,891,"  Everything what KelfuN mentioned is bang on.  That is the key, legwork.  And York is a great place to start, but watch out for some deep spots, they can come on you in a hurry, probably best to just go in with some old shorts and shoes.  Seen lots of guys do that, plus if you go too deep, you'll be fine."
359042,ld17,2009-07-06 18:37:00,319,"I connected at the dam with in-line spinners.  Seems people don't use them much from what I see, but I caught 5 bass at the dam with a mepps."
359089,timmeh,2009-07-06 20:41:00,609,"No one is going to give up their secret spots so the best thing to do is to pick a spot and giver a go. The dam at Caledonia is a start, but is usually busy. If you're willing to spend the time you should be able to find some nice spots in that area.The baits Rich mentioned are a good start, don't be afraid to throw a topwater from time to time."
359200,n8tivebigguy,2009-07-07 01:32:00,30,Its just that fishing in the grand really differs from fishing in a lake. The strong current gets the best of me sometimes.   Thanks for all the replies and i will try my luck in caledonia+york.
