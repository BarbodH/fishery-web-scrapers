358325,bucktail,2009-07-04 00:19:00,1857,Just posted today on ESPN as well on Japanese television.  Looks to be a tie with George Perry's ancient record.  By the sight of it I cant really argue!!   http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/bassmas..._Japan_20090702
358326,Musky or Specks,2009-07-04 00:25:00,2710,Oh no there goes Tokyo Go Go....um Bass

358347,Dara,2009-07-04 01:46:00,3052,Looks like a good lake to hit for big fish anyway
358350,kickingfrog,2009-07-04 01:52:00,8333,Can't be. The new record bass is going to come from Texas...... or California...... or Mexico........ or Cube. Clearly that bass can't read fishin' mags.
358353,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-04 01:57:00,2038,"World record or not , if i catch something that ugly i'm cutting the line at the boat...  :wacko:"

358949,bucktail,2009-07-06 14:15:00,1857,"That bass reminds me of the big fat guy that had to have his wall broken down and taken away on a fork lift!!!  Caught on a live bluegill, wonder if its in its belly, hey it would give you an extra 6 ounces for the record!"
358955,NAW,2009-07-06 14:36:00,4022,That's one obese fish.
359057,lunkerbasshunter,2009-07-06 19:08:00,2585,its too bad a monster fish like that had to die.  sure is a big bass though  cheers!
359068,hammercarp,2009-07-06 19:52:00,964,So they not only make better cars they catch bigger bass.   What's next a gay French guy winning NASCAR.
