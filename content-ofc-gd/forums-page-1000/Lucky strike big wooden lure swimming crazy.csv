225068,MuddyWater,2008-07-08 21:23:00,218,i bought one of those wooden plugs for some musky action but it was swimming all drunk. it would go fine until i sped it up a little then it would go on its side and wiggle to the top i tried bending the lip and stuff but it did nothing. its this kind of lure here http://www.luckystrikebaitworks.com/product.asp?p=54# any help would be great. these work good for me and i dont wanna spend more money on another until its been smashed up by some ski

225081,Roy,2008-07-08 21:50:00,13728,What speed does it blow out at MW? Lots of baits cannot run at more than 2-3 mph.
225082,Raf,2008-07-08 21:52:00,3495,"with these big lures, it's not uncommon.  - make sure the hook hangers are aligned.  - don't bend the lip, bend the eye that you clip your snap/split ring to.  if it's blowing out to one side, bend the eye to the other.  a little does a lot.  it's a bit of an art but you'll get the hang of it.   i think a lot of guys ditch their brand new baits on ebay because they can't get em to run right.. works for me!"
225084,MuddyWater,2008-07-08 21:56:00,218,its bucking out very slowly no where close to 2-3mph more like medium craking speed... it doesnt have a bendable eye thinger i know about that it has like a loose swivel creation thing going down thats why i was tweaking with the lip. ill check the hooks out tho thanks so far.
