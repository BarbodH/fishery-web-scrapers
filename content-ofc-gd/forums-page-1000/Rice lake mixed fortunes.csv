It started out by me forgetting to make sure that I put the plug in the boat before I launched!!  Oops     I parked the van and trailer about 500 meters away and when I returned most of the back end was full of water!!      Back I go to get the van!  I get the boat hooked onto the trailer, get back into the van and put it in drive.  The van rolls about a foot or so back because of the grade and the current  pushes the boat sideways.  Unfortunately I didn't notice this and when I pull forward the boat falls sideways off the trailer!!  Back out I go, push the boat in the water, then hook up the boat again.  This time it goes ok and there isnt really any damage to the boat.  Drain the boat, back out we go!!!  Luckily after a couple of minutes the storm cloud brewing in my head disappears and all is fine.  My little shadow managed to catch a few rock bass and a perch, and I managed to catch a few bass.  We call it a day after a few hours and just as we get the boat on the trailer and climb into the van the heavens above open up.  Perfect timing!!        "

Half way into the water I put the brakes on because my mind is screaming about the plug.  Only got a little water in there, but it's still enough to rattle you!!  Glad to hear you got it all sorted out and got into a few fish with your son!!!"

My old Lowe Bass baot used to have a geyser coming out of the floor drain whenever I did that.  ... but with the Tracker Deep V, I can fish all day and not even notice the plug is out... until the boat comes out of the water on the trailer. Then the poor thing takes a big ol' hard whiz... for a long time!!! (Don't ask me how I know this, because it's never happened to me before.)  Nice fish and pics!!!"
