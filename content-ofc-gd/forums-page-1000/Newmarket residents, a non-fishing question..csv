224952,pameladallaire,2008-07-08 17:24:00,470,"Hi Everyone:  I need some help from those living in Newmarket.  I was contacted by an Art Gallery in Newmarket called ""Select Art Galleries"", located at 16686 Yonge Street.  I have never heard of them and can't find any information about them on the internet other than a map to their store.  Has anyone ever seen this store (beside a framing shop) or has anyone ever been in the store?  I am leary about sending paintings anywhere I haven't been.  Any help would be appreciated.  I have talked to the woman by email but I would like to know more about the store from someone who has seen it.  Pam"
224957,Cast-Away,2008-07-08 17:41:00,790,"Pamela, they are a legitimate gallery. I had some framing done there in the past. They have their own building at Yonge St and Mullock Dr."

225146,maybe,2008-07-08 23:52:00,307,"They seem to have 2 business names, with very different looking Yellow Pages ads:  Select Art Galleries  Picture Frame Factory Warehouse  The Select ad points to www.selectart.ca, which just dumps at a placeholder Bell web page.  I tried pulling Archive.org copies, and got the same placeholder going back years.  No hints there.  However, I did stumble onto a page saying that Select has exhibited works by Barrie artist Melanie Springbett.  She'd be a good person to ask about these people.  Contact information is on her page.  Congrats, and best of luck!"

225363,cthewrld,2008-07-09 12:09:00,99,"I have been there many times.  They are a legitimate gallery, and framing store.  They are quite well known in the area.  Michael"
