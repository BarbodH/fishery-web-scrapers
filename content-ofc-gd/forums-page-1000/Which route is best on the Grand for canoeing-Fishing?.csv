224976,markiemark70,2008-07-08 18:15:00,158,A friend and I are planning to do one of these canoe trips down the Grand the weekend after this one. Of these routes listed here:  http://www.heritageriver.com/routes/  which one do you think is the best for Bass and maybe some Pike?  Thanks.
225001,danbo,2008-07-08 18:42:00,2646,"Closest section to Lake Erie will have the most fish, from the 1st dam & downstream."
225005,Motorhead,2008-07-08 19:00:00,163,My personal favorite route is from Caledonia to Cayuga... Yakes about 2 hours if you`re paddling or 4 + hrs if you just float ...  Lots of nice spots to fish   good luck  Doug
225010,MARK69,2008-07-08 19:07:00,24,"Coming from the Kitchener area, I would say the Cambridge to Paris or Glen Morris to Paris...Not alot of accessible water there from shore and not nearly the fishing pressure they have down closer to the lake...Good Luck wherever you go..."
225020,Mike Pike,2008-07-08 19:30:00,1332,Cambridge to Paris has the greatest elevation change so the fastest stretches of water.  Great if you like a little more excitement.
225029,jediangler,2008-07-08 19:44:00,1923,I'm not familiar with the river anywhere but from Elora to Blair. If you want to fish this section try these guys. http://www.canoeingthegrand.ca
