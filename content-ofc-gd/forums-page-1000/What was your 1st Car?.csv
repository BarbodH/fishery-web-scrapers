A bunch of us in high school pooled our money and bought a '53 Chrysler Something with a Red Ram Hemi in it. It was a very pedestrian sedan with the bottoms of the door posts rusted through. When we went around corners the bottom of the doors splayed out like wings (sorta). The driver's seat was a coke crate (the old wooden ones). We parked it in an alley and we met at the car every morning, drove it to school, then went touring at lunch time and after school. Our folks woulda killed us if they'd found out. Gas was $0.35/gallon then. We'd split on a gallon or two and drive till it was running low. The muffler was shot so we used to wire a metal oil can to the end of the pipe after we'd punched a bunch of holes in it. They usually lasted for a day or so. It sufficed. When the car finally appeared to be on the verge of total collapse we drove it to the town dump one day and abandoned it. Our folks never found out. Life was so much simpler then.  JF"

Whe I got out of graduate school I realized that there was a problem in getting what I wanted - money.  So I looked at the British Epic at $1995.00. My father came with me shopping and he did not like British cars - at that time people liked American cars. My father would say - ""for a little bit more you can get a XXXX."" With this kind of logic, I moved up from the Epic and then to the Nova, Nova SS, Chevelle, Chevelle Malibou and then to Cutlass ""S"".  I finally settled on the 1968 Cutlass Supreme.  I found a PIC online showing exactly what my 1st car looked like - all colors, vinyl roof etc.  The front wheels did not lift off the pavement but it was fast - I love those V8's.

Lots of memorable trips in ""The Gal"" One time 7 of us and all our gear went camping for 3 days in it. It would fit 3 people comfortably in the trunk for sneaking into the drive in for long weekend all nighters. It also got about 25 miles to the gallon on the highway if you laid off the 4 barrels....  My dad rebuilt the motor for me and left it in the car while he did it!!! There was enough room to stand inside the engine bay while doing the top end and for the bottom end we just put it on jackstands to do the bottom end.
