224974,Oktravis,2008-07-08 18:07:00,62,"I picked this right off the link that dando gave in his safer boating info thread.(thanks danbo)  Marking of Vessels 13. (1) No person shall operate a vessel that is licensed under this Part unless that vessel is marked with the licence number of the vessel in block characters not less than 75 mm high and in a colour that contrasts with their background (a) on each side of the bow of the vessel; or ( on a board permanently attached to the vessel as close to the bow as practicable so that the number is clearly visible from each side of the vessel. (2) Subject to subsection (3), no person shall operate a vessel marked with a number that is so similar to the marking required by subsection (1) as to be capable of being mistaken for the licence number. (3) Subsection (2) does not apply in respect of a commercial fishing licence number marked on a vessel pursuant to regulations made under the Fisheries Act.  hope this helps travis"
