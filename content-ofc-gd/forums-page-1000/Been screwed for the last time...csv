225189,maybe,2008-07-09 01:10:00,307,"Prepare to get more telemarketing and personalized junk mail from Bell than you ever thought possible.  I tossed Bell's land line and DSL service last year, in favor of a small local company.  Within days, Bell started phoning and stuffing my mailbox with sappy ""we miss you!"" garbage.  No matter how often I told them to take the # off their list, and to never attempt to contact me in any way ever again, they just wouldn't give it a rest.  Sometime this spring, I stumbled onto a note somewhere saying that it's illegal for a carrier to call you for a year after you tell them to take a hike.  Next time they called, I threw that on the table.  Whaddayaknow - no more calls, no more junk mail!  May that little tidbit bring you peace and quiet as well."

225245,Trax416,2008-07-09 02:11:00,10,"FTA goes down, but not as much now as it was five months ago. Many groups are close to creating a full emulation, which means your TV will be up longer then ever. I use a Sonicview, which has one of the top support teams, and it was up for damn near 3 months until a few days ago.  Also, if any of you are paying for your firmware, just go to FTAtalk. They have it immediately and it's all free. Don't get suckered into paying for firmware, it's not faster then free sites like FTA talk, and it's all the exact same firmware from the same support groups.  Just make sure to get a top brand of FTA reciver with a good support group. So when it does go down, your new firmware is up for download within a few hours, instead of a few days.  lol, who knew my first post was not going to be about fishing :\"

225254,danc,2008-07-09 02:23:00,4677,"From totalfta.com  ""Recently there has been quite a scare involving a new change within the Canadian system. There are reports that they have already began swapping customer's cards with the new generation encryption. This is something that everyone should definitely be keeping an eye on, however it doesn't seem to be anything to really worry about because it shouldn't cause anyone any issues anytime soon. I'm pretty sure it'll be a while before we really hear serious talk of their system upgrade.""   I don't know what all of this really means, because I don't use FTA. All I know is that when I want to watch something on tv, I just turn it on and it's there for a buck (or 2) a day.  Trying to run and stay ahead of the game to save that kind of cash? It's just not worth my time."

225278,oncogene,2008-07-09 02:54:00,154," There's always those ""scares""... not a big deal.  I've seriously considered getting BEV before.... but they simply price themselves out of my affordable level. $2/day, that's $60/month... or $720/year. And if i remember right, for $60/month, u don't even get everything, right? Full subscription needs like $90+.... and that's still all the PPV, NHL & NFL packages to pay extra for. The NHL package alone is an extra $200 or $250?  You can setup FTA for <$250. Even if u just gona use it for 5 months, it's already less than what you'll pay to Bell. Yeah it goes down... like 1/2 a day every month or 2.... no big deal. We can watch CBC for free anyway if daily news is urgent."

Not to mention, I absolutely hate the way satellite/TV companies package channels into those stupid ""theme"" packs. It's nothing but a rip-off. Imagine u go to Timmy and they have 12 favours of donuts as a ""theme pack"", then favours of muffins as a pack. You want to grab a chocolate donut? Sure, but u can't just get 1..... You'll have to buy the whole donut pack for $5. Oh, and b4 u can buy the donut pack, you'll have to buy the basic coffee first too. Oh, and that donut pack u get, u can only eat 1 out of the 12. NO NO, u can't eat more than 1 even if ur stomach has room... .and NO NO u can't share with other ppl either. And we'r supposed to say it's a good deal getting 12 donuts for only $5 and pay for them? No thanks."
225295,Trax416,2008-07-09 03:24:00,10,"I live in Toronto and here is what I pay for Internet/TV.  Rogers charges me $120 for a basic digital TV package. I don't have the HD package, and I don't have the sports package. in fact they just took off some channels last months, yet I pay the exact same rate.  Rogers also charges me $100 for Internet service.  I have a very old home (built in the 50's), and need two computers, one in the basement, one on the top floor to have Internet access. Wireless routers don't work in this house (neither do cell phones for some reason). Also, since it's an old home, and the way it's designed, drilling into the floor isn't an option.  I use my computer as a living so it's essential I have fast Internet. I called up Rogers and explained my situation. I said I could be using a router, but with the way my home is built it's next to impossible unless I wire Ethernet into the entire  home which means ripping down sections of the walls. I said why not just charge me for a single connection. They refused and even threatened to raise my price to $200.  Needless to say I dropped the Digital TV, and I am planning on dropping their internet as well.  You guys should also read what they are doing with the Iphone. They are ripping off everyone in Canada, to the point where their is a huge news story about it and Apple is threatening to cut rogers off."

I really haven't had a problem with Bell...times that I did need to call re: Sympatico, I ended up having some pretty good laughs with the guys and gals in India.  Sure some accents are a bit thick, but so are some French accents here in Canada...better listening skills and a good attitude will go a long way.  I can only imagine the abuse these people take on a daily basis all because of an accent.  Good Luck Gerritt."

225378,holdfast,2008-07-09 12:52:00,1813, Yup your right.  Heard on the Hews Bell and Telus will charge 15 cents for each incoming text.  This will include advertising.  This is worth Billions for the companies.  Switch now and show your displeasure before they get away with it and others follow.  Just like Oil and gas
225422,Mike01,2008-07-09 15:00:00,378,I would love to reply to this more in depth but I think the thread would get locked pretty quick.  Lets just say that I'm not a very big fan of Bell.  Does anyone know of any discount carries for phone and interet in the North Bay area?
225453,Carp,2008-07-09 17:03:00,1488,"I pay $42/mth for home phone (full features) and high speed internet. A company called CIA or CIA / Cybersurf based in Ottawa. They are associated with my original isp called CYBERSURF based in Calgary.  The only downside is that occasionally the phone service is down for a bit. It runs off my high speed internet cable & through a VoIP box. They've had some sort of bug recently and I can only call out. No incoming calls. Hey, works for me. The wife is a little peeved though. Should be rectified shortly.  Our cell phones (basic plans) are with Fido (owned by Rogers) and cost us more than double what the home phone & internet costs us.

It is cheaper and better. 3) Ditch Bell Satellite, live off OTA and if you choose FTA and torrents (FTA goes once maybe every 2 months). 4) Call up Rogers and tell them to smootch your buttj, even if they don't provide service to your area.  forrest"

Unlike Bell these two companies will give you DSL without home phone.  This will save you about $25/month.  Also for LD on home phone, Telehop 1010-100 (.25 first 15min, .04 /min after) or 1010-620 ($1 per call unlimited minutes) are pretty cheap /minute across north america."
225135,Terry,2008-07-08 23:37:00,14456,"just for the record FTA never goes down   but if you use the receiver to get bell or dishnetwork, they do spend lots of money to send ECM to shut down the people getting it without paying for it...  and they do it more then every two months"
