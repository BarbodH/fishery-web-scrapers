224980,markiemark70,2008-07-08 18:20:00,158,  Are you sure about that? I am a Cogeco customer in Milton and I have it.
224982,bpsbassman,2008-07-08 18:23:00,941,I'm a Cogeco customer in Grimsby and have it.
224989,Fang,2008-07-08 18:29:00,1330,I'm a cogeco user as well (oakville) and I have let them know several times I'm waiting for OFC.  Have to take the kids swimming now at my moms place. Can watch the kids from the corner chair in the fmaily room and have chennel 426 on.  Hook and Look is very cool - love the underwater shots. Gotta love those saltwater shows especially that one from Australia. I need a cold shower after that one.
225014,Mike Pike,2008-07-08 19:23:00,1332,"Mark Adams and BPSBasssman!  Yup, Congeco customers in most regions get it, which is why I'm so disapointed that they decided that Hamilton customers weren't going to have it!  I called to complain but just got the usual 'blah, blah, blah' from them.  But you should see the crappy stuff that we DO get.  Man, if you like dog shows and ghost stories,,,"
