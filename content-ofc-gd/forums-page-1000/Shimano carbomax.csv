223112,Reef Runner,2008-07-04 13:58:00,980,"Hello,  Last weekend I noticed that the tip of my regular spinning outfit had been seriously damaged somehow and kept slicing my braid.  I was too busy during the week to go get her replaced and now the weekend is upon me and I'm short a spinning rod.  Now I know the old saying ""you get what you paid for"" but I'm looking to grab a cheap, decent temporary rod to pair up with my Shimano sedona 5000rb with 20# pp.  I'll have time to stop into LeBaron's on the way up North and was looking through their flyer to notice that Shimano's Carbomax 7foot medium/fast is on sale (CMS70M2).  Anybody own one of these rods?  Opinions?  Thanks in advance,  reefrunner"

223116,Reef Runner,2008-07-04 14:03:00,980,"Thanks Johnny!  Called Lebaron and they're all out of the 7foot model, might grab a 6'6"" while my rod is in the ""shop"". hehe."
223122,Andy,2008-07-04 14:09:00,330,"I use a 6'6"" medium Carbomax for all my jigging for pickeral. Probably not the finest jigging rod out there, but I like the feel of it (or at least I have developed a feel for the rod) and I think you'll really find  it's good value for the money. Andy"
224956,bbog,2008-07-08 17:39:00,665,Was in the LeBaron's Woodbine store last night and they have all three sizes of the Carbomax in stock. They were $24 each. I was tempted to pick up an ultralight for a spare but didn't - may go back.
224961,Reef Runner,2008-07-08 17:45:00,980,"The LeBaron's in Mississauga was clean out of the 7"" and 6""6.  They did have two 5""6"" ULs left but wasn't in need of one.  So I spent double what I came in for and bought a Fenwick Canadian Methods 7"" med.  Oh, and some more tackle. lol.  Isn't that always the case?  hahaha  PS.The rod worked well for me this weekend"
225137,smbhunter,2008-07-08 23:38:00,186,"I've had a 7' med carbomax for over 10 years now. I picked it up used from my uncles buddy for $10. I used to use it as a jerk bait (husky jerk) rod fishing for pike mainly in simcoe, and even for casting spoons and spinners for salmon. I don't use it much anymore, but it does somehow find its way into my rotation at some point during the year. It's a great rod for the money."
225498,Moosebunk,2008-07-09 18:15:00,3970,"They're much like the Izumi series rods.  At least the one I have.  I won one in an online photoderby thingy once.  It's OK... served me OK.  I like having it around, it's a 6'6"" medium spinning rod and it does feel much like my old Izumi rod of the same.  That old rod just bagged me 10 pike over 40 inches while I ran 30lb braid on a Symetre reel so I think it'll work for ya in a pinch dood."
