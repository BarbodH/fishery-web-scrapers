224807,Canuck2fan,2008-07-08 12:10:00,1444,Wow what a story holy excitement!!!!!  Sorry you didn't have a record in the end but you have done the community here a great service by showing how easy it really is to get an official weight done. The minute I started reading this thread this morning I kept YELLING at the monitor GO to a 7/11 with a post office or the like. I know they have them EVERYWHERE in London and the stores are OPEN 24 hours. I knew a guy who owned 3 of those type of convience stores with postal outlets a few years back.... You could likely get most clerks to help you out at any hour of the day or night who work the graveyard shift as it has to more exciting to be a part of history than to deal with drunks who always show up when you are working those shifts. LOL  Now everyone who reads this thread knows do not transport the fish alive or if you do don't mention it LOL. Next getting a certifed weight quickly is important and don't trust ANY scale unless it is certified. (I have worked in food service for 30 yrs and I have yet to see an accurate scale of any type certified or not but if it has that sticker it is legal and that is what counts). Next best option FREEZE the fish if you can't find an all night grocery store or postal outlet at a 24 hr convience store with a certified scale. Also having a preprinted off record form from the OFAH in your vehicle could be a real time saver if you are ever lucky enough to need one. LOL  Again thanks for the excitement!!!!
224854,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-08 13:49:00,1362,What a great catch!!!....congrats to you
224681,Daplumma,2008-07-08 01:29:00,1961,"First off,great catch!That is one prime Sac a Lait!The finest freshwater fish you will ever taste.Second,mention this website and send a link to this thread and all the buzz it generated.I have heard of Advanced and I live 14+ hours south of there.Maybe an OFC discount or an advertisement with the community would help them out also.Good job! Joe"
224696,brickNblock,2008-07-08 01:50:00,598,Beats...not jumping on the bandwagon at all...... What an exellent catcth and one to tell your grandkids about one day...

224707,MoriaRiverMan,2008-07-08 02:19:00,314,Congrats!!!  Great story........  Now i know the process to pull when i reel in my 140lbs musky this weekend
224708,jace,2008-07-08 02:25:00,472,   I'm glad you did it or you would have 2000 forum members hen pecking you for who knows how long. I guess fishermen are as bad as nagging wives except it's not about getting the lawn mowed.
224762,camillj,2008-07-08 09:00:00,1988,Too bad about the record ... but the mount will serve as your own family record for many years (or genrations) to come ... and I know you'll be thrilled with the job they do at Advanced ... they truly are masters.
224321,Reef Runner,2008-07-07 14:38:00,980,"Regardless of records that could have been, a great catch and a fish of a lifetime.  Congrats Beats.  That is one awsome fish."
224115,keram,2008-07-07 01:53:00,585,O.K. Most current record is here.  2.71 lb.   Yours is still bigger  http://www.notjustfishing.com/Fishing/records.shtml
224116,danbo,2008-07-07 01:55:00,2646,Here's some other monsters.. http://mrriver.com/records.html
224119,forrest,2008-07-07 02:01:00,1032,That crappie is HUGE!  hope its survives the night...here is a site that has a couple of tips that you may be able to implement tonight: http://www.zeiners.com/tips/fishalive.html There have to be a few more sites like this.   Bass Pro would not be able to give him anything for it so why not let it go?  I don't think its legal.  If it is an official record I think I read something about them freezing the fish and giving the champ a free replica.  I am sure this info is in one of those links someone else gave.  forrest
224120,Beats,2008-07-07 02:01:00,543,"So it says to either take it to the MNR or OFAH office. Anyone know where one would be close to London??  Also, where do I get this thing weighed?  Am I just supposed to walk into a post office and have them weigh the fish and also get its girth and length?"
224128,danbo,2008-07-07 02:04:00,2646,Call your local taxidermist. You need a Notary person to sign an affidavit.
224131,Beats,2008-07-07 02:06:00,543,"One other thing, since its been so long the fish isn't likely to survive.  Its in a garbage can and I have no way to aerate it.  Can't get it weighed until the morning so I guess I just let the fish be, and if it dies leave it in the water until the time of weighing?  I wish I had a 2nd set of scales to verify that my weighing is correct.  I have Berkely boga-like grips with a digital scale on it.  I am just afraid that I am either getting a false reading or that the fish will somehow lose weight before I can get it weighed."
224132,Greencoachdog,2008-07-07 02:07:00,8163, You can get it weighed at a grocery store (meat dept). Any place that has scales certified for sale by weight.
224134,danbo,2008-07-07 02:08:00,2646,
224136,danbo,2008-07-07 02:10:00,2646,Any big grocery stores open nearby..do it tonite!!
224137,Greencoachdog,2008-07-07 02:11:00,8163," Freeze the fish immediately if it dies, wrap it up good!  Your weight is 2 and just a smidge over 5/8 of an oz. better than the current record, if your scales are correct... but I wouldn't count on it. The fish may actually be heavier... or lighter."
224138,modny,2008-07-07 02:11:00,502,"if its not a record, i'm sure it will make a nice snack"
224139,Beats,2008-07-07 02:13:00,543,"So it can be weighed at at a grocery store or post office, but does the person doing the weighing need to sign something?  Do they need to be the one to take measurements?  If the fish did indeed weigh enough I am guessing that it would be enough to just get the weight and then drive it to an MNR office and they could do the rest. (?)"
224141,danbo,2008-07-07 02:15:00,2646,"yep..right down the serial #  of the scales you weighed it on.  Maybe call the police, they could get a Conservation officer to witness the weigh-in!! This is too cool!!"
224142,ehg,2008-07-07 02:16:00,2666,"No matter what that is a Canadian record white crappie!  Like others said get it weighed on 'official' certified scales, witnessed and the weighing photographed. The sooner the better as they shrink in captivity or when dead. Awesome and congrats! ehg"
224149,danbo,2008-07-07 02:20:00,2646,Call your local newspaper too! Maybe you will get a pic. Your own TV show too!
224152,Beats,2008-07-07 02:29:00,543,"Well the fish is pretty much dead now.  I tried calling Sobeys 24/7 and A&P 24/7 stores but they both said that I would have to call back in the morning and talk to the dept managers etc.  I can't blame them, its a pretty weird phone call to answer.  Can't think of any post offices open right now either.   I'll just leave it in teh garbage can over night.   I just hope that after all this my scales were vastly off or the fish somehow loses weight.  All I can do is wait for morning and go and see.  Either way it turns out its a massive fish."
224155,danbo,2008-07-07 02:34:00,2646,Maybe wrap the fish in a big ziplock & freeze it if its belly-up now.
224158,icedude,2008-07-07 02:37:00,459,  Congrats Beats---nice fish dude--think it is white myself  would concur with Greencoachdog--give Bass Pro Shops Vaughn a call in the morning--George Wallace--1-905-761-4000 as a potential tank specimen and get that puppy on any certified scale at your earliest    did not know about the stomach content analysis requirement--that's why i joined this Community---learn lots   Enjoy the Excitement!
224159,Beats,2008-07-07 02:39:00,543,"  Ya, im not really sure how to keep it at its best.  I am hoping to get it weighed early morning and don't want to wait around for it to thaw out.   I just weighed it again at 2lb 13 oz, but again, my scales are kinda ""iffy"" and I am kinda worried about it losing weight over night.  I was thinking of adding ice to the water.  I don't know, this whole deal is really stressful.  I just hope my scale doesnt say 2lb 14 oz and then I get it weighed in at less.  While my fish seems to beat the current record, it really isn't far off.  I am afraid that it will somehow lose weight over night.  I can't think of any where that is open to get it weighed or else I would be there."
224161,oxcowboy,2008-07-07 02:42:00,544,"im pulling for ya, sure hope its a record for ya.   keep us updated as to what happens.  would be good information for everyone on the board as to what you must do if it ever happens to anyone else.  Great job, and great fish of a lifetime.  jason"
224163,danbo,2008-07-07 02:44:00,2646,all-night drugstore?
224169,Joey,2008-07-07 02:50:00,9122,"First of all, congratulations, what a slab.  Second, I just went through this with my carp in January.  Download the OFAH form and print it.  Take it to the post office or local meat dept. of a butcher.  Weigh it and then have them put the scale serial number etc. on the form.  It doesn't matter if it is dead or alive and it doesn't matter if it is fresh or frozen, it weighs the same.  Good luck.  Joey"
224170,bassmaster4,2008-07-07 02:52:00,801,congratulations on the slab hope everything works out and you get your record!
224172,Beats,2008-07-07 02:53:00,543,  Oh really?  I actually remembered that carp when I was thinking of what to do.  I had no idea that the weight wouldn't be thrown off by freezing it.  I certainly didn't think someone would weight it frozen.  My concern was freezing it and then thawing it and having the fish somehow lose weight.  Perhaps I will freeze the fish tonight then.  Did you freeze the fish in water or just in an empty freezer bag?  If they will weigh it frozen then that is even better.
224176,Joey,2008-07-07 02:59:00,9122,"Well, because of its size, it was actually in a garbage bag  OFAH was the ones who told me it would weigh the same frozen, and doggonit, they were right.  I weighed it that night before it was frozen, then we left it outside (it was January remember and it would not fit in the freezer), then I took it to the post office frozen and it weighed exactly the same.  The post office tried to give me a hard time.  They thought they had to sign verifying that they had witnessed me catch the fish.  I politely had to point out all they had to witness was the weighing of the fish.  I had to ask for the manager tho.  Good luck.  If you have any more questions, just ask.  Joey"
224072,Beats,2008-07-07 01:29:00,543,Its 100% a white crappie.  There aren't even any black crappie where this was caught.  Funny thing is that every other crapiie I've ever caught there was like a few oz's in weight.
224073,kickingfrog,2008-07-07 01:30:00,8333,Isn't the imperial weights and measure system great.
224075,danbo,2008-07-07 01:31:00,2646,"Ooops! Count the spines on the front Dorsal fin... 6 is a White!  Spread the fin out for another pic too,please.."
224076,jace,2008-07-07 01:33:00,472,the pciture looks like a white to me too going by the spine count on the dorsal.  nowhere near a world record but it could be the canadian as other pointed to.  world record is 6# for black and 5+# for a white
224077,Beats,2008-07-07 01:33:00,543,"So I am confused as to the record system.  If it's the OFAH that is in charge, their website only seems to record black crappie and there is no listing for white crappie entries.  Yet when you go to http://ontariofishing.net/fishrecords.html you see a white crappie record.  So what's the deal?  Basically this fish is still alive and if there is going to be some big runaround and then I find out that there isn't a catagory, I'd rather go drive out and release it alive... while I still can."
224078,Greencoachdog,2008-07-07 01:33:00,8163,How many dorsal spines does it have?  7 or 8 = Black Crappie  5 or 6 = White crappie  Looks like it has 6 or 7 to me from the pic.
224080,glen,2008-07-07 01:34:00,2641,I hope it is a white.
224082,mattyk,2008-07-07 01:34:00,2110,my vote is for a white crappie.
224083,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-07 01:36:00,0,"Either way, that is a monster crappie! What a mouth!"
224084,jediangler,2008-07-07 01:36:00,1923,"Very nice fish regardless. Congrats, don't forget to get a pic with you holding it before you release it. That will give it better perspective for size."
224088,kickingfrog,2008-07-07 01:36:00,8333,Excellent fish by the way.

224095,mike hagan,2008-07-07 01:41:00,50,"Not sure if this helps but what the heck. Cant tell by the pics. The white crappie, Pomoxis annularis Rafinesque, 1818, is native throughout the eastern half of Canada and the United States, and has been widely introduced in the west as well.  The dorsal fin of the white crappie has six spines. The maximum recorded length for a white crappie is 53.0 cm (21 in), with a maximum weight of almost 2.35 kg (more than 5.18 lb); it can live as long as ten years.[3]  These species prefers slower-moving water, often turbid, whether a backwater of a small creek or a large lake.  When spawning, the white crappie deposits its eggs on plant surfaces[3] or in poorly-defined nests in shallow water.[6]  This very prolific fish may overpopulate small bodies of water under 40 ha (100 acres) in area.[10]   [edit] Black crappie The black crappie, Pomoxis nigromaculatus (Lesueur, 1829), is very similar to P. annularis in size, shape, and habits, except that it is darker, with a pattern of black spots. It is most accurately identified by the seven or eight spines on its dorsal fin. The oldest recorded age of a specimen is fifteen years, although seven years is a more typical life span for the species.[4] [5]  The black crappie's range is uncertain, since it has been so widely transplanted, but it is presumed to be similar to the white crappie's; as of 2005, populations existed in all of the lower 48 states.[4] [11]  The black crappie tends to prefer clearer water than the white crappie does. Its diet, as an adult, also tends to be less dominated by other fishes than that of the white crappie.[4] [11]  The breeding season varies by location, due to the species’ great range; breeding temperature is 14‒20 °C (58‒68 °F) and spawning occurs between April and June.[5] Spawning occurs in a nest built by the male, who guards the eggs and young.[4] [7] [5]"
224097,keram,2008-07-07 01:41:00,585,Looks to me like white crappie. Six spines and dark vertical bars. Black crappie has irregular dark coloration
224101,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-07 01:43:00,2585,how cool is it going to be that  an ofner is a canadian record fish holder!  Awesome fish!  Cheers!
224102,Beats,2008-07-07 01:45:00,543,"OK, so here's the deal.  Does the fish need to be killed and weighed in order to be considered a record?  Because from what I can see there is no official record kept for white crappie.  There is a listed current record weight, but the OFAH site doesn't list white crappie as a possible entry.  If this is the case, then I am happy to just take pics with measurements and pics with me holding it on a scale and then go and release the fish.  I don't want to kill the fish unless it can definitely be a certified record."
224103,Greencoachdog,2008-07-07 01:46:00,8163, Yeah 2 lbs. 14 oz = 2 and 7/8ths lbs... convert 7/8ths from a fraction to a decimal 7 devided by 8 = .875 or 2.875 lbs.
224106,danbo,2008-07-07 01:49:00,2646,Phone the MNR
224107,keram,2008-07-07 01:49:00,585,It is listed here  http://ontariofishing.net/fishrecords.html
224109,Greencoachdog,2008-07-07 01:50:00,8163," The stomach contents may need to be examined for it to be a record.  Contact the BassPro shop in Vaughn, they may want it for their aquarium if it's not too far from you."
224110,glen,2008-07-07 01:51:00,2641,The mnr has a record white in the guide to eating sport fish.  So they must keep a record or at least they did keep one.  The hard part is getting an official weight.
224111,Grimace,2008-07-07 01:52:00,2020,"I sure hope it is a white bro.   I dont know if its camera flash but it looks like a white to me.    not sure about the crossbreeds in these fish's either,    I am pulling for you buddy.        Even if it is a black      beauty crappie.   i counted 6 on the dorsal.   that would put in in between.    hope she is a white man.    letter get tested, she doesnt have a breeding season left in er anyway."
