This one is about 8 or 9 lbs.   Sorry about the cooler picture but this was headed for the BBQ.  Love those GBay salmon.  I just wish there were more around.  "

We were at the tourny a few weeks back at AC Marina and the conditions on GB have deteriorated....94 people and a total of 6 fish caught...3 salmon....1.9 pounds won the tourny at 1000.00 bucks...2nd place .7 pounds...yes that was POINT 7 pounds...crazy stuff...."

225300,Canuck,2008-07-09 03:38:00,491,Azulu  Thats not good news on the AC tourney.  I don't know what happened to the salmon last few years.  Funny thing was I also did not get a laker.  Normally I pick up a few each trip and keep a small one for the table.  I marked very little baitfish this time either.  Maybe the zebra's??  Anyway its kind of disappointing.  I probably spent $100 on fuel to get one fish.  I guess the bass fishing is good though so I guess I can always switch targets.
225405,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-09 13:57:00,0,Sounds like you caught the biggest and only Salmon in the lake.lol I think you may have gotten lucky. but it does seem the Salmon population is dying or adapting to different conditions. Who knows....
