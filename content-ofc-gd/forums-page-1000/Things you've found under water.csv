225287,CLofchik,2008-07-09 03:14:00,854,"Most of the crazy stuff I've pulled out came off the piers & rivers salmon fishing. I don't think I've ever actually bought a Cleo or J-13, I just pull them off fish that have been broken off  Definitely my biggest haul was a Loomis GL2 float rod with a Daiwa Emblem-X that got pulled in, was a $500 rig that buddy was using to line chinnies with!"
225324,camillj,2008-07-09 08:05:00,1988,  Heh .. I was just gonna say I lost a 50+ musky almost exactly there ... boatside self-release... but mine was ACTUALLY north WEST from Big Cliff's dock ... by my figuring North East would put me somewhere on the highway by Dunsford  :)
225401,HTHM,2008-07-09 13:48:00,4082,"OK, so I am directionally challenged.............in the direction of the big barn from Biig Cliffs dock. I was so befuddled that day I had no idea which way was which"
225446,Rich,2008-07-09 16:52:00,3927,"I found a bank card and a Visa once at the dam in Bobcageon.  Also, didn't dive for it but I once hooked and brought in the bumper off an F-150 on my flippin' stick. lol"
224848,Jaymerica,2008-07-08 13:41:00,12,"I was in the Grand River Bass derby this past weekend and observed about a dozen canoe's flip in the rapids most of them were rentals from the local outfitter. people reported loosing cell phones camera's cooler bags among other things. I decided to keep my eyes open when wading for any items that may have been lost by the end of the day we had found hundreds of golf balls a digital camera, fishing lures, a radio, flashlight and tons of beer bottles and cans. I used to dive for lures at the mouth of a local river, I could fill a tackle box on a good day. Does anyone snorkel these local rivers? If so what are some of the things found?"
224857,Nemo,2008-07-08 13:57:00,727,"Usually snorkel around campsites in Algonquin. Typical catch are bottles, cans and old lures etc. Have also found broken paddles, tent pegs, assorted clothing, some pots and pans.  Tons of old stubby bottles. A couple of years ago I pulled up almost a case (24) stubbies. Hualed em out and returned them.  Some of the bottles though can be quite old.  Kind of depressing really."
224863,ecmilley,2008-07-08 14:08:00,2163,"found lures of course, car batterys and tires, but latly I have been looking for my dock which got washed out about 2 weeks ago"
224877,bassboy,2008-07-08 14:53:00,161,"Well....if anyone is diving on Sturgeon for stuff and you happen to find a 6'10 compre with a Curado 200DHSV please let me know  LOL  It went swimming there a couple of weeks ago  (long and painful story) and it never came back  But too keep the message on topic, I was fishing a creek many years ago and got a toilet seat......

224890,Marko,2008-07-08 15:17:00,854,Two bodies lol. I am scared to know where those came from
224891,kemper,2008-07-08 15:18:00,2232, Do we want to know  I guess as long as you didnt put them down there...
224899,jediangler,2008-07-08 15:30:00,1923,Found a x-rap in the Grand last week. We used to find full cans of beer in the Elora conservation area. The guys who float down inside inner tubes would lose them and they would all end up along the shore next to an eddy.
224900,JohnF,2008-07-08 15:31:00,3494," Not my fault, and they were quite fresh, which pleased me to no end. It really sux hanging out with a body on a small boat. A falling apart body would be icky.  JF"
224935,bbog,2008-07-08 16:51:00,665,"I'm a diver like JohnF and have found pretty much the same things he has except for the BODIES. I can add bicycles, snowmobiles, dive watch and yes lots of lures. Try to avoid diving/snorkeling where people are shore fishing - don't want to get caught yourself!!"
224941,c-denby,2008-07-08 17:01:00,1,"i've found lots of lures and old line with bobbers and a hook attached to logs, bicycles, sunglasses, beer bottles, tires, a gold diamond ring once, fishing rods, hats, anchor, and a computer once..   these were all from snorkeling in a local quarry.. that is local hotspot for swimming and fish.."
224946,Fang,2008-07-08 17:07:00,1330,"Do a ton of snorkelling in Temagami and seen all kinds of stuff.  Lawnchairs, Cassette radio, towles, ...... Must fall off the houseboats  neatest find for me was a perfectly round white rock the size of a golf ball. I was in the Muskokas on a private lake and thought it was a golf ball and dove down about 15 ft to get it. Turns out it was a piece of white granite that was sitting in a large bowl shaped depression. I guess over a long time the wave action and water current rocked the white granite chunck and wore it down smooth and round.  Still have it sitting in my shop.  Picked up other item like pike pole, bottle and around the copper mine on Temagami came up with a 6ft core sample still intact."
224951,goodtimer,2008-07-08 17:24:00,53,cool thread.  haven't done much diving but i do enjoy it.  have only found lures and golf balls...each time i snorkel i'm terrified of seeing a body...i'd freak out.

225000,Cudz,2008-07-08 18:39:00,2652,If anyone finds either of my lucky craft lures on Simcoe can you return them.  Thanks
225007,JohnF,2008-07-08 19:02:00,3494, I suppose they woulda been eventually.  JF
225009,JohnF,2008-07-08 19:06:00,3494," You just reminded me. I found a Nitek-C computer once. Actually it was another guy who spotted it but he thought it was pooched because it was just flashing at him and he couldn't get it to do anything else. I took it, looked up the manual on the net, reset it and it's worked fine ever since. It had been laying in 75' of water for a few days. I guess the computer thought it's owner would be bent silly by now.  JF"
225011,JohnF,2008-07-08 19:09:00,3494," How do you think I felt on body recoveries? I had my fingers crossed on one hand that we wouldn't find it, and on the other hand that we would. Caves were the worst if you were going in right after someone had disappeared, presumed dead.  JF"

225275,Sinker,2008-07-09 02:53:00,8692,  I'll keep an eye out for it  I just hope I don't stick one of my musky baits into it......do you think 80lb PP would pull that up?  Sinker
