224565,audio_mad,2008-07-07 22:37:00,28,"Hey Guys, I spent 3 days in a raw on Rice lake this week-end (July 4,5,6). Only caught 2 bass.  Went on the boat around all 3 islands (near Gores landing): tried to trall, spinners, spoons even live bait (leaches and worms). Terrible!!! No bites!!! Any tips, was anyone successful at Rice lately? Thanks"
224568,misfish,2008-07-07 22:45:00,29133,Docks and more docks. Rice lake is full of them.
224594,Stoty,2008-07-07 23:28:00,2910,"I was on Rice last week, and like you it was abnormally slow! We only boated 2 bass the whole morning. Mind you one of the ones I got was 4.5 lbs and lost another about that size.  We flipped the docks at the marina at Gores Landing with not even a bite!  It was pretty bad. Definitely not a typical season for Rice."
224607,Steelcat,2008-07-07 23:46:00,191,"There was a bass tournament last weekend, so many pros were out prefishing all over.  Maybe they hooked onto most of the fish But me and my bro managed to catch 40+ bass last thursday and friday."
224610,misfish,2008-07-07 23:47:00,29133,Stay away from the popular spots. And switch up.
224683,Dozer,2008-07-08 01:33:00,896,I was there on Sunday... there was a tournament finishing up...  We went out for 2 hours out of Bewdley.  Had a great time fishing.  Drop offs and smokey tubes
224687,Rich,2008-07-08 01:38:00,3927,Summer patterns. Drop the spinners and pick up the plastic worms!
224729,kemper,2008-07-08 03:26:00,2232,"I was on Stony yesterday, found the fish to be in late spring post spawn areas and mode... was strange because it is july but I guess the cold weather this spring delayed everything."
224793,ccmtcanada,2008-07-08 11:44:00,7971,"I hear you....  With my luck this year, there are no fish in Scugog and Sturgeon either...."
224798,Greencoachdog,2008-07-08 11:54:00,8163,"Fish are like small children. Set them down and leave them for a while, and they're never in the same place when you return!!!  They were probably there, but refused to bite. Heavy boat traffic (Bass Tourneys) can really give them the lock-jaw!"
224806,BabyHerc,2008-07-08 12:09:00,285,"Also consider the bluebird skies and zero wind this past weekend.  That makes a tough bite where ever you go.  As said above, it's midsummer, so pick up the jigs and plastic worms.  And time your trips to stay away from tournaments."
224874,Whopper,2008-07-08 14:29:00,2174,Just received a report of people that are there and catching fish. Spinnerbaits over open water weed beds have been putting bass and walleye in the boats.
224893,kemper,2008-07-08 15:20:00,2232,"  Seems to me that this pattern works ALL THE TIME.  Ill be at buckhorn for a week in 4 days, and the white spinnerbait will never come off my rod, and I will outfish many who go low and slow because of the heat."
