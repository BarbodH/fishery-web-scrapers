224811,bigcreekdad,2008-07-08 12:24:00,546,"What are you folks using? I was up in northern Quebec last week and our guide had a Garmin with great maps, although they were topos only (no depths)."
224814,Smokey,2008-07-08 12:31:00,1278,I use a Garmin 60csx along with the garmin topo maps and they work well for me.
224815,Raf,2008-07-08 12:32:00,3495,another vote for garmin.  mine is an older etrex legend.  i load it with topos but it will handle hydro maps too.l
224840,Stoty,2008-07-08 13:05:00,2910,Lowrance 522 iGPS with Navionics Gold Charts.
224903,taper,2008-07-08 15:33:00,611,I have not bought it yet but I am also heading the Lowrance way.
224931,corvette1,2008-07-08 16:48:00,1765,i have a lowrance lcx 25c and gold chip love it
224933,TJQ,2008-07-08 16:49:00,7806,  ditto
224936,bbog,2008-07-08 16:54:00,665,Another longtime Garmin user. Have all the maps I need but sadly Bluechart data is not available for the lakes I fish.
224938,ccmtcanada,2008-07-08 16:56:00,7971,I just got the Lowrance H20c with Navionics Gold maps.  I love the thing...it's awesome on lakes I'm not familiar with...which right now is pretty much every lake...LOL.
224939,jwl,2008-07-08 16:57:00,1056,"the old fashioned way...just go out there and scout around and fish and see what I come up with and devlope patterns from there, heck I have only had a fish finder/depth finder in any boats my familly has had for the last say7-8 years and still caught lots of fish in lots places before that"
224963,Reef Runner,2008-07-08 17:49:00,980,"I too vote for Garmin.  The downside, like Barnie's mentioned, bluecharts don't detail some of the lakes I fish as well.  Check with your retailer before purchase and ensure your most visted lakes are on the software package in detail."
