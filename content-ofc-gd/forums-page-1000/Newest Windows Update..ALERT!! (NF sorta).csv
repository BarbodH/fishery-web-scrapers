You can turn  off Zone Alarm until a fix comes out. Some have found that turning the security setting down to medium also fixes the issue. Zone Alarm will issue a repair in the next day or so. I will leave this on the main page for a day or so then move it to the computer section. More quality work from Microsoft!"
