When they arrived in Newfoundland, they went to an insurance agency, to see how much it would cost to insure.  The agent looked it up on the computer and said to the couple,  '$39.00.'  The husband was shocked and asked why it was so cheap here in Newfoundland to insure, because it cost him $2000.00 in Ontario !!!!  The agent turned his computer screen to the couple and said,  'Well,..here it is on the screen,it says:  *Any wooden structure, with a sprinkler system over it, is $39.00.*"
