I rigged her up with an old rod and a push button reel I bought for her ( she didnt like using my spinning reel a few weeks back) So off we went,  dad, my g/f and I to see what we could get ahold of ... I put on a downsized spinner for her to use and told her to reel like crazy to keep it up out of the weeds ...  Next thing I know shes screaming  IM STUCK !!!  I looked over to see her rod jolting with a fish on the other end so with some words of encouragement she pulled in this nice bass, her first fish from a boat and definitly alot bigger than her tiny perch off the dock...    I landed this pike soon after ..    I managed to get 2 pike , Dad got the big SKUNK and samantha was the grand champ with 3  yep 3!!!! bass..  man she wont let me live that one down !"
