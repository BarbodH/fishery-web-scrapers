225463,carp-starter,2008-07-09 17:20:00,253,"Crappieperchhunter  I cannot see myself paying for certain things – one is text messaging. I do not walk and speak on the cell.  I have a cell phone from Roger and the cost is $9.95 per month. I keep it for emergency purposes. If something happens to my car in the middle of nowhere, I call phone CAA. There are many other possible emergencies. So ten bucks per month is not much. I have no contracts – it is month by month.  Included in the $9.95 price was voice mail – had it for 7 years. Then about 18 months ago, Rogers converted to the new format. After one year, my voice mail got cancelled – will have to find out why because Rogers said that I will have all services with the new format.  Of course I get only 18 minutes free per month.  I look at my cell phone as INSURANCE at a very low cost.  Carp-starter   I just cannot see me paying $.15 for each incoming message. At the same time, the same person will send text messages – I do not know the cost. And this is just to receive or send a message.  For 6 bucks at Bell one can get voice mail that will hold 5 voice messages. For 8 bucks, I think that 25 voice messages will be held. I betcha that this in most cases will result in lower costs than texting. So, everyone get voice mail and at the same time this will be telling bell and others to go to hull."

225470,fisher,2008-07-09 17:26:00,451,"I heard about this story from a co-worker and I called Telus this morning.  They said that I would be charged for incoming text messages even if I did not open the message...seems kind of unfair especially if its unsolicited or wanted - basically out of my control.  Now for me, since I don't use Text messaging (or web browsing for that matter) on my phone, I asked that they suspend/cancel these two services.  To my surprise it was very easy and doable - and here is the best part, it was FREE - wouldn't be surprised if they change that too.  It only took two minutes to suspend the services once I got the operator on the phone   .....  ...but it first took about 15 minutes of being on hold  ."
225479,Zubris21,2008-07-09 17:34:00,563,"  FYI for all of you, I worked at a call centre for T-Mobile (american carrier) about a year ago.  They may have had cheaper plans (much cheaper in fact) but they also charged customers for both incoming and outgoing text messages ($0.15).  I think it's ridiculous that we are charged for receiving something, but at least Canadians had the edge in that department for a while.  Who knows maybe the money the americans were making on those charges allowed them to offer the cheaper rate plans.  on another note.... They have Cell phones in Uganda??"
225490,kickingfrog,2008-07-09 18:06:00,8333," In many countries (and not just ""poor"" countries IE Sweden, Finland, Norway) the cell coverage is better/ more reliable than land lines."
225411,ccmtcanada,2008-07-09 14:14:00,7971,"When I had rogers as my cell phone carrier, THEY would send me SPAM text messages.  I'd check my phone and what do I see? ""Check out rogers.com for the latest offers on internet phone"".  If they are still doing that then that's likely why they have no plans at this time.  To put the onus on the consumer to call to dispute spam is ridiculous.  They costs just to run a cost center would be huge for that."
225414,crappieperchhunter,2008-07-09 14:30:00,2582,"A modern convenience we all must have it seems. Watched the ""sickness"" first take my daughter, followed by my wife and most recently my son. So far I have resisted getting a cell phone. No real use for me, so why bother? If I needed one for my profession then I would have it. I figure I have about 4-5 circumstances a year where I really wished I had one. But I can't justify the cost to myself for those 4-5 times. Look up the word cheap in the dictionary...there is a smiling picture of ME.  As soon as my wife/daughter told me receiving text messages was ""free""...I said that will not be around for long. First they get you hooked and then they reel you in!!!  Your best hope is that competition will keep prices reasonable, but it appears telus and Bell are already ""in bed"" together to ensure they continue to take as much out of our pockets as they can. The others will follow....it is just a matter of time."
225416,steve_paul,2008-07-09 14:42:00,658,I asked my son the other day what was wrong with carrying a quarter in his pocket and using a pay phone like I did growing up.  He looked at me like I had 2 heads
225417,BITEME,2008-07-09 14:45:00,1969, GOOD OLD FACE TO FACE
225423,ehg,2008-07-09 15:07:00,2666,If they say there is 1.4 billion text messages a month at 15 cents a message they could rake in 2.5 billion dollars from this in a year at that rate. Any rationalization about this other than more profit is crap doublespeak.
225424,CLofchik,2008-07-09 15:25:00,854, Not exaggerating enough is more like it.  FYI --  Canada has the 2nd highest mobile rates in the world.  #1 is Uganda.
225433,Beans,2008-07-09 16:16:00,3339,  Maybe because it costs 50 cents...
225434,steve_paul,2008-07-09 16:23:00,658," LOL, shows how long it has been since I made a pay phone call I guess."
225436,Fisherman,2008-07-09 16:28:00,7201,"Ever think that if they don't answer the phone, maybe they have call display and they don't want to talk to whomever is calling.  Texting costs too much, real simple, don't use it. What did people do 25 years ago, they weren't on the phone all day, they were actually WORKING instead of pizzing the day away.  Kids weren't on the phone either, they were playing or doing homework."
225440,kickingfrog,2008-07-09 16:45:00,8333," Pay phones aren't as prevalent as they used to be, I guess because we all have cell phones."
225447,kickingfrog,2008-07-09 16:53:00,8333," No I haven't because I'm important.  People weren't sitting in front of computers ""talking"" about fishing, hockey, politics and the law either.  This isn't about what to use or not use, it is about a lack of real competition and/or choice for the consumers."
225448,Rich,2008-07-09 16:54:00,3927,"We got the family plan with free texting and free local calling between our phones. The time texting comes in handy is if we're long distances apart it's free to text, no outrageous long distance charges."
225449,Rich,2008-07-09 16:56:00,3927, Payphones now cost 50 cents   if you're using a payphone all the time you're probably better off with a cell phone financially!
225454,blaque,2008-07-09 17:04:00,2419,"The cell phone, the demise of the youth of today......or at least part of it. My Alexis has had hers removed from her collection of gadgets........and wont here the flip of a cell phone for a long time.  Im sure back when i was 12 or 13 the adults were saying...........""stupid Atari 2600, its the downfall of society""..........one day well probably look back on this and say, cell phones, remember those things..........what an inconvenient piece of equipment, as we will probably just be communicating thru telepathy after having a chip installed in our temples at birth. Thats when you know revelation is coming lol"
