225008,Roy,2008-07-08 19:05:00,13728,I guess it's all been covered several times now eh? The next OFC G2G will be help at the Service Canada offices.
224873,Pinch,2008-07-08 14:21:00,231,"  Not true.  under the Canada shipping act they can 'stop or board any craft at any reasonable time.'  So telling them no is just going to annoy them and ensure that you get a ticket for every offence they suspect you have committed.  sec 196 of the Canada Shipping Act 2001  Powers (4) Enforcement officers acting under subsection (2) and inspectors acting under subsection (3) may  (a) stop or board the craft at any reasonable time;  ( direct any person to put into operation or cease operating any machinery or equipment on the craft;  Â© direct that the craft not be moved until the inspection is completed;  (d) direct any person to move the craft to a safe place if the officer or inspector has reasonable grounds to believe that it does not meet the requirements of this Part or the regulations made under this Part or exposes any person to serious danger, and direct that it not be operated until it meets those requirements or no longer exposes any person to serious danger; and  (e) direct any person to move the craft to a safe place if the officer or inspector has reasonable grounds to believe that the operator does not meet the requirements of the regulations made under this Part, and direct that the operator not operate it until the operator meets those requirements.  Duty to assist (5) The owner or person in charge of a pleasure craft and every person on board shall  (a) give an officer or inspector all reasonable assistance to enable them to carry out an inspection and exercise any power conferred by this section; and  ( produce to an officer or inspector any document, or provide them with any information, that the officer or inspector may reasonably require, for the administration of this Part or Part 5 (Navigation Services) or the regulations made under either of those Parts."
224947,dannyboy,2008-07-08 17:11:00,367,"More plainly under the Small Vessel Regulations:  POWERS OF ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS  46. An enforcement officer may, in order to verify and ensure compliance with these Regulations,  a - go on board a vessel;  b - examine a vessel and its equipment;  c - require that the owner or the master or other person who is in charge or appears to be in charge of the vessel produce, forthwith,  (i) personal identification, and  (ii) any licence, document or plate required by these Regulations; and  (d) ask any pertinent questions of, and demand all reasonable assistance from, the owner or the master or other person who is in charge or appears to be in charge, of the vessel.

224958,fishinggeek,2008-07-08 17:44:00,325,Thanks to Pinch and DB for quoting the law before one poor soul starts ranting about an unlawful boarding!  I didn't know that either.  And thanks to Lew for that great tip of leaving a photocopy of the proper papers in the boat at all times.  Good advice from OFC yet again.
224978,Fisherman,2008-07-08 18:17:00,7201,"Yes, after remaining in the background on this one, you'd be surprised how many barrack room lawyers and Harry Kopitos are out there that have ""heard"" things and give out bogus info when dealing with the law.  It would probably be to their advantage to listen and read rather than spout about the bovine manure they don't know jack s___ about."
224985,BITEME,2008-07-08 18:27:00,1969,stop whining pay the money you were wrong end of story!!!! carry the stuff you need on board and you will have no worries HOW HARD IS THAT!!!!!
224987,jonnybass,2008-07-08 18:28:00,346,"Woops! I stand corrected! Thanks for setting that straight. (I should have looked it up myself)  I assumed that since they ""asked"" to come aboard, you had an option to say no. lol (similar to when a cop asks if they can come into your house, you can say no if they don't have a search warrant)  I guess they only only ""ask"" to be polite, when in reality they are coming aboard whether you like it or not.  Since they can legally do as they please, I highly recommend that you do not give the cops any attitude whatsoever as you are completely at their mercy."
225004,Want,2008-07-08 18:55:00,39,"Now Yyou sound like a fun guy. You must be a real joy when you screw up, huh? Or perhaps you think you don't? Patrick Perfect or something is your middle name?  I don't remember stating that I wouldn't pay the money. And I contacted the Prosecutor's office to settle this asap. So go rattle someone else's cage besides your own, huh?"
225006,jonnybass,2008-07-08 19:01:00,346," Don't let people like that get under your skin... You'll spend most of your time here arguing and bickering if you respond to every ignorant fool that flames you. Trust me, I know first hand. LOL"
224656,forrest,2008-07-08 00:36:00,1032,"  The word from the traffic ticket paralegal guys is that the meeting with the crown prosecutor is a waste of time that is just used to waste the ticketed persons time: http://www.roadwarriors.ca/ontario_traffic...ickets_tutorial  Maybe the cops will not show up, this used to work for traffic tickets.  Hope it works out for the original poster.  $430 is steep.  forrest"
224658,fishing n autograph,2008-07-08 00:40:00,2540,"  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA of course they're gonna say that. They want you to go straight to trial so they take your money....you'll get the same result with the crown that you would with a paralegal....and what's worse, he takes your money because they guarantee that you'll win....well they don't tell you that they'll get your fine reduce lol....and most likely the copper shows up unless something happens and they can't get there. We HAVE to go to traffic court and i wouldn't take the chance............lol....good luck  Oh and BTW, if you fight the ticket yourself, i can GUARANTEE you're paying the full whack....."
224660,Gerritt,2008-07-08 00:44:00,6129,"Those were the days of old forrest... they Need to show up now.. Lost revenue may be the answer.. I used X-Coppers when I was ticketed.. I was on my way to get my son to a doctor as the daycare called me... and they never call me!.. I was speeding granted.. I was polite to the officer, asked him if he could please hurry and give me the ticket as my son is sick and needs me.. I even thanked him.. he is just doing his job after all..  the fine was 3 hundred and something.. and 3 demerits.. to fight it through xcopper was 400... a no brainer for me.. and they guaranteed to have it dropped or I did not owe them a cent.. I was lucky and won.  my first and only ticket...  Hopefully if the OP is willing to fight it to a lesser charge he will.. even if he knows he was wrong as I did.  Chalk this up to a lesson learned and move on..  G"
224219,camillj,2008-07-07 05:52:00,1988,"Sorry to hear about your mess-ed day ! Sometimes a warning would go a long way toward better relations ... especially if you actually had a flash in your safety kit ... anyhow to answer the question which Rich and a few others had ...  I found this on service Canada's website (geesh I can bet big bucks on the fact that the old-tinny-at the cottage has no ownership papers - its at least 50 years old ... the full document is online at http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/en/sc/boats/index.shtml  Rich - It would seem that registration is not mandatory as long as your boat was licenced ... and licence is only necessary if you have greater than 10hp ... =============  Registration The Canadian Register of Vessels is a title system for the ownership of vessels. It contains information on each vessel, such as ownership and vessel characteristics, i.e., tonnage, construction material, and type. Registration in this register, in addition to providing an official number, also provides each vessel with a unique name. It also confers certain benefits, such as the right to fly the Canadian flag.  Owners who intend to use the vessel as security for a marine mortgage are required to register their vessel.  Registration is optional for all pleasure craft, regardless of tonnage and length, as per the Canada Shipping Act.  New owners of a previously registered vessel who choose to license rather than reregister their boat must provide a transcript of the history of the vessel, obtainable from a Transport Canada registrar, attesting that the vessel has been taken off the Canadian Register of Vessels. The owner must then remove all official markings from the exterior of the vessel and place the pleasure craft licence number on both side of the bow (see Question 16).  There are costs associated with registering. However, the registration is good for as long as you own the vessel. You must carry registration documents on board the vessel at all times, together with any other ownership documents, to help avoid delays clearing U.S. or Canada customs, or in case of a fine.  Transport Canada provides this registration service. For frequently asked questions on registration, please visit Transport Canada's Web site.     ============== What is a pleasure craft?  A pleasure craft is a vessel that is used for recreation and does not carry passengers. It is a vessel of a prescribed class under the Canada Shipping Act.   What types of boats need to be licensed?  A licence is mandatory for all pleasure craft equipped with a motor of 10 horsepower (7.5 kilowatts) or more, including personal watercraft.  Pleasure craft of all tonnages and lengths may be licensed as per the Canada Shipping Act. Alternatively, pleasure craft owners may choose to register their vessels in the Canadian Register of Vessels.   I just bought a new boat. How do I license it?  To license a new or previously unlicensed pleasure craft, you will need the following documents:   a completed Application for Pleasure Craft Licence; proof of ownership of the vessel; and a valid piece of personal identification. If proof of ownership is not available, you need a declaration under oath stating why you cannot produce the bill of sale or proof of ownership. You may use the sample declaration provided or another similar document, as long as it contains all of the information required.  You can apply for a Pleasure Craft Licence at any Service Canada Centre. For the location nearest you, visit our Find a Service Canada Centre Near You page or call 1 800 O-Canada.  You can also apply by mail. If you are applying by mail, include a signed photocopy of your personal identification document. We will return the photocopy to you when we send you your licence.  For more information about licensing a pleasure craft, visit our How-to page.  ============"
224226,JFR,2008-07-07 10:00:00,498,"No excuse for NOT having the required/mandatory safety equipment on board. Zero tolerence is the position being taking this boating season. This topic, safety equipment required and licensing regulations have been discussed ad-naseum on this board.  Use the search engine and learn something.  My advice QUIT YER WHINNING, read the regulations that have been linked her several times.  Before you leave the dock make sure all necessary equipment and documentation are in your boat.  just JOHN"
224229,lew,2008-07-07 10:14:00,12767,I have a photo-copy of my registration in a zip lock bag and it's taped inside a compartment in my boat and readily available when ever I'm asked for it. I've been stopped & checked by the OPP many times over the years and a photo copy is perfectly legal and it keeps the original in a safe place at home.
224236,modny,2008-07-07 10:58:00,502,no offence. but althought u feel like u may not have deserved the fine. you did.  what would a cop do if he pulled you over in your car and u didn't have the registration for your car? same thing.  atleast you know for next time.
224241,Want,2008-07-07 11:36:00,39," I very much do know for the next time. As to the car, I think it depends on the cop, location, and circumstances. Some would offer a warning, some would write up a ticket, some would ask that you bring in your ID to the station within 24 hours.  As for the comment about my whining by ""Just John"": Guess you must walk on water or at least you think you do. Have you checked lately? Spare me the lecture."
224245,modny,2008-07-07 11:50:00,502, some cops are just control freak power addicts though..  my friend didnt' have his reg. i was like o poop he's gonna get fined.. but he just played stupid and got off with a verbal warning. i was like man u are super lucky thats like a 350$ fine
224258,bushart,2008-07-07 12:11:00,2628,"Some of these responses are like individuals have elected themselves Judge/Jury & Executioner---The guy had an oversight and it cost him---I think nobody would be happy with the $430 touch  I myself have grabbed my flashlight out of the boat in a hurry because it was close and threw it in my truck only to drop the boat in the water sans flashlight---now I just travel another 100 ft and get another light.  Now instead of posting ""Wants"" picture in the post office as someone who ravages the country's waterways knowingly breaking Transport Canada's laws--cut him some slack---cause I have yet to meet that person incapable of an oversight.  Bushart"
224294,blaque,2008-07-07 13:22:00,2419,"tough call, i guess they are doing their jobs, ....agreed, but who the heck came up with $430 dollars!!!!!!!!!!! This day and age thats enough to break the bank and really mess someone up financially! I think the fine is justified, as hard as it is to swallow........but the amount is way more than necassary in my opinion."
