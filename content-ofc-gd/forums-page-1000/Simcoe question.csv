I know this is a good spot because we have seen countless amount of fish and some really big ones to. My brother managed to hook a 5+ smallie on a spinner bait but other than that we didn't get much. I was hoping someone could tell me what is working this time of year? We have used everything from cranks to tubes. We are fishing anywhere from 5-15ft of water around the island. We are going to be going back out this weekend again in hopes of landing some big smallies so if anyone could tell me what I am doing wrong or should try I would really appreciate it. You can pm me if you feel come comfortable.   -Fishnpro"
