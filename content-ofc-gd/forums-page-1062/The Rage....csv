176859,pigeonfisher,2008-03-26 17:35:00,696,"So then, Let's us it on the Near North Anglers and Swillers!!!  TEP, Colin, Raf, Gerritt, Spiel, John, Kelvin...I can't even remember!  Can't forget Lew coming out to a couple.  Mepps came out to a couple...DANG  I know some nights lasted a long time.  One night we ended up at Gerritts house and he showed us the ""lady shows"" on the big screen"
176866,Gerritt,2008-03-26 17:42:00,6129,Hahahahaha... that was a riot all the guys in the basement.. fun times man!
177127,holdfast,2008-03-26 23:45:00,1813,"Never called him a loser, might of told him to bear it, like everyone else, and straightened him up with his ref Money going to Iraq instead of the Roads in Ontario.  As far as poor drivers, Being from Quebec, driving in Europe, and living in Ontario- The GTA has the one of the worst drivers that I have ever seen.  Now, for my point to you- What are you trying to accomplish.  The good samaritan award.  So what happened to that thread of the angry outburst.  I just had to lay it out when he actually believed money would be better of for his highway than an non existent war in Iraq in which he believed we were in.  We Canadians have enough problems than some Naive person cooking up a story.  Just giving you my reason for what I said as obviously I was not able to defend myself as I had to work."
177130,Gerritt,2008-03-26 23:49:00,6129,"Uhmmmmmm Huh??  Holdfast, I think your an asset to this board given your past and the things you have seen and accomplished... but this post makes little to no sense..  G"
177188,Puckhead,2008-03-27 00:42:00,377,"Even in 02 (there were rants then too BTW), you couldn't accuse OFC of being boring.  Sorry, OFC - I still can't get used to that..."
177191,pigeonfisher,2008-03-27 00:43:00,696,"hahahaha,  Dude, it get's better by the minute.  Just proof that Truth is stranger than Fiction."
177232,Greencoachdog,2008-03-27 01:54:00,8163,"Yuck it up FF!!!  I'm glad you're so easily amused... a plate of chicken wings, a 2/4, and a bug zapper... you'd prolly piss yer pants!!!"
177236,Gerritt,2008-03-27 02:00:00,6129,"   unfortunately I have seen it first hand....but then he got married up had kids and a dog...... and has become the man we all wish we could be.....  to be honest i sorta envy him, as you can tell from Steve's demeanour he lives his life without stresses... because he chooses too...  G."
177240,ccmtcanada,2008-03-27 02:03:00,7971,"So, did I miss anything today?  I went to work and then went fishing with Bly....got skunked....maybe I'll post a report....."
177246,pigeonfisher,2008-03-27 02:07:00,696," That is true about the stress thing.  I wake up every day and do the very best I can to make that day one of my top 10 days of all time.  1-5 are taken for some pretty serious stuff.  6-10, it's game time.  The very worst blow life could deal me would leave me in the top 5% (Mental Wealth) in the world.  We are blessed to be allowed to worry about the frivols of life.  Now I also understand passion, entitlement, accessibility, and even the debate over backgrounds in a photo.  IMAGINE for one minute some of the terrible things that people within a 5km radius (10-20 for you guys out in the sticks) are having to deal with tonight without the support networks like we have.  Anyhow...I love it.  Opportunities are ready to smack you in the face tomorrow...are you ready?  I am !!!!"
177247,Greencoachdog,2008-03-27 02:09:00,8163,"  Nope, not a thing. Go to bed unless yer gonna write the stinky report."
177248,pigeonfisher,2008-03-27 02:09:00,696,CHAT?
177284,LundGuy,2008-03-27 03:19:00,169,"Rage, some here....http://www.jibjab.com/view/161841"
177288,douG,2008-03-27 03:27:00,2693,"Who woulda thunk it?  Steve is becoming the OFC Zen master.  Live the dream, be the dream."
177347,Greencoachdog,2008-03-27 12:11:00,8163,  You've got a lot to learn aboot life... we all have our stresses.  Marriage and children are 2 of the biggest.
176662,pigeonfisher,2008-03-26 13:14:00,696,"I can't wait for fishing to open up again.  Not that I fish but you guys all have the rage.  If you can read the posts with a smile it makes it all seem like a bit of comic relief.  People from one side of the country calling people on the other side losers for not liking the weather, nets or no nets, why would you make a post to say you caught fish, it goes on...and on...and on.  FYI life is pretty good.  If these complaints (other than poor Rickster who's brother does need out thoughts today) are the worst things that are happening in peoples lives it goes to show that we are a very wealthy (Mental Wealth and Monetary Wealth) and happy society!  I hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Please keep this up because it sure is entertaining!!!!"
176664,Stoty,2008-03-26 13:15:00,2910,"Hahaha, I totally agree with you.  Well said."
176666,Gerritt,2008-03-26 13:15:00,6129,So a guy walks into a bar.....
176667,Stoty,2008-03-26 13:16:00,2910, OUCH!  Maybe next time he should watch where he is walking!
176670,Reef Runner,2008-03-26 13:26:00,981,"Kudos Pigeonfisher.  I too have noticed an over-abundance of ""the rage"" as you say.  Too bad for the guys that post just to share their experiences only to get ripped up by overzealous members, my hope is they don't get deterred from posting.  When I see bad judgment in replies to posts I would just remind myself that there are more better seeds than bad ones here, as Scotty's act of kindness in a previous posts demonstrates to go with others.  Me thinks it's just cabin fever setting in...  reefrunner"
176673,Terry,2008-03-26 13:31:00,14456,"I disagree with threads like this one, it outrages people to see that you have a different opinion then they do.... and how dare you make fun of their rage....   damn, when will these anti-rage threads end... I hope open water comes soon"
176675,Gerritt,2008-03-26 13:35:00,6129,I am full of rage that we have a thread about the rage...  Now.... lets talk about little chicken arms dusted in flour and sauced...  G
176676,Kirk,2008-03-26 13:35:00,347,Obviously a very well disguised rant...
176678,pigeonfisher,2008-03-26 13:40:00,696,"hahahahaa....  BEER, CHICKEN WINGS, ELITISM"

I am also sitting back and reading the posts and laughing at all the comments being made.  This forum was so perfect back in 2002 eh?"
176839,pigeonfisher,2008-03-26 17:06:00,696,"It was a long, long time ago, but I can still remember...the day the first swill happened.  Myyyyy, Myyyy did the pitchers run dry.  Drove my chevy to the firehall but the taps were all dry. Good old boys were eating wings and telling lies.  The day the swillers tried..."
