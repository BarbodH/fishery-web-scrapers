177245,KyleM,2008-03-27 02:07:00,218,Iam trying to gather some links on C&R. Not the actual C&R aspect but the conservation side.  Example:  Articles on keeping big fish in a lake.....the genetics of breeding more big fish. (the above is the major one Id like some info on)  Survival rates.  This sort of stuff.....Im trying to educate some folks here that are extremely ignorant.   Thanks
