I am hoping that some of the tribs will be clearer then chocolate milk.  I got out to Bowmanville on Monday for a few hours and all I can say is wow!  As much as I love the hard water, there is nothing like getting a line wet on a sunny spring day.  Only 29 more sleeps till the official trout opener.  If things stay on the cold side and the creeks do not get blown out, we may be in for a better then average opener here in the far south.  I have been eyeing up the Bronte never fished it before (now it is 5 minutes from my office) hoping that the Steelies can make it up that far and if so will still be haning out on opener.  "
