177364,pigeonfisher,2008-03-27 12:52:00,696,Wow...Never seen this before...hahahaha
177367,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-27 13:01:00,4399,Ya that one sure has made the rounds.
177370,Terry,2008-03-27 13:05:00,14456,"wow...where do these pictures come from   2 fish on a stringer the smaller fish  has it's head in the gill plate of the bigger fish....no I wouldn't call it a double header   sorry.......that picture has been around for about 5 years and 2, 3 times a year someone posts it here and on every other website going  your subject line was one of the better  and more honest ones most people claim their buddy caught it just days before.......... ........LOL"
177374,rickster,2008-03-27 13:14:00,495,you should see the picture of the pike my cousins buddys uncle caught on rainy lake
177379,Stoty,2008-03-27 13:24:00,2910,"I figured someone would have posted it before, but thats the first time I have seen it. Either way, its still pretty messed up!  lol  I bet it put up quite the fight though!"
177383,Roy,2008-03-27 13:30:00,13728,"Yeah, that's an old one Stoty. It was caught on Lake of the Woods by a Dutch immigrant. But thanks for sharing."
177384,Terry,2008-03-27 13:31:00,14456,"the fish were caught one at a time the guy used a piece of rope as a stringer he tied it to the first fish, when the second fish was caught he slide  the rope through the gills and out through the mouth over time, while the stringer held the fish in the water, the first fishes head got stuck in the gill plate of the second fish on the stringer giving it the look you see in the picture  it is an optical illusion..... 2 fish no mutation  but it does make one hell of a internet story"
177390,Hookset,2008-03-27 13:35:00,367,"Yep, it happens. My brother and I were fishing Pike on Nippissing near Jocko Point (think that was the name). Found 2 fish in the same predicament. Ones head was sticking out the gills of the other Pike. One swam away no problem, the other = fish crisp. I've seen more weird things on that Lake than all others I've fished combined. There's something very special and weird about Nip.   Hookset."
177391,Stoty,2008-03-27 13:37:00,2910, Ah crap.....I thought it was an Oshawa Pike or something.....
