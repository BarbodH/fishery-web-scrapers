177327,Canuck,2008-03-27 10:32:00,491,Wayne or anyone else up that way know if there is still ice around the docks at the marina's in Penetang Bay?  I am wondering if if might be worthwhile going to our marina to try for some perch around the docks.
177328,AzuluSpookd,2008-03-27 10:37:00,348,Lots of ice around all the marina's here. People still icefishing....for perch and whitefish I would imagine...It's gonna be a while yet
177385,irishfield,2008-03-27 13:32:00,26272,I haven't been out on it yet...but I'd guess there has to be over two+ feet of ice everywhere... except the usually creek outlets and springs. Don't know what Marina you are at... do they have any slips with bubblers around boats that don't get pulled?
177698,Canuck,2008-03-28 00:33:00,491,Hindson.  No boats in over winter I don't think.  The docks are floaters and the ice melts around them pretty early.  I guess I'll have to wait a bit.
