Can anyone make recommondations on a hotel or motel in Napanee or area, that is suitable for a family? i would consider renting at a lodge as well. thanks"

They have really great services, excellent sites/boat launch/and fish cleaning area.  They have trailers you can rent, but I'm sure how great they would be for a family.  Also theres a place called Pickerel Park (I think) around there that I believe has cabins you can rent. I'm not sure what their services are like though, I've never stayed there.  heres the link http://www.pickerelpark.com/"

Long weekend in May is very popular, call and book  when you decide.  The recommendations in this thread should be looked at very carefully. a quick to see what some people think about a place is to ask if anyone has stayed there and what was it like. The replies can be surprising.  Hopefully the walleye are still biting on that long weekend.  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad"
177346,edmichit,2008-03-27 12:07:00,145,"thanks superdad, i just noticed a post discussing Bay View Inn Motel, i see what you mean on how to post a request like this. i've been out there before on the long weekend, we usually have success, but that was many years ago. With any luck we can pattern them, and with a little luck, have some fun. thanks"
