177254,tibbs,2008-03-27 02:23:00,650,Anyone know these signatures? I think the first ones Doug Gilmore.  
177256,BillM,2008-03-27 02:28:00,17367,"Hrm, furthest one on the right looks like Lefevre."
177262,muskymike,2008-03-27 02:35:00,772,"Oh no Bill, please dont tell me you were a fan hahahaha"
177268,irishfield,2008-03-27 02:39:00,26272,I'd have to find my son's signed Gilmore jersey to confirm the first one... and it's probably blown away from last nights gale so not sure where I might find it...but I'll look.
177271,DanTheMan,2008-03-27 02:43:00,257,"I think it says,  Since 1967 we won the last cup !!!!!!  :whistling:    :Gonefishing:"
177276,BillM,2008-03-27 02:48:00,17367," I have an autographed #22 Ken Baumgartner Leafs jersey, what do you think?"
177289,tjsa,2008-03-27 03:28:00,1578,"here are the sigs I have, Challenger Astronauts Ken Money and Marc Garneau, a sticker they signed for me.Met both of them, shook both their hands at the time, then hit them up for the autographs,  lol. They were cool about it, since they relied on me to make them look good at the time.    And, this one is from way, way back, in my very distant youth, its a hockey stick signed by Bobby Hull, through Sears......and Roebuck, lol It IS his signature, I watched him write it at the time, I think I was 8 yrs. old at the time, I got to shake his hand, the hockey stick is only about 3 ft. long, lol.  Darn it all, mom would not let me play with it, she was smart back then, lol.      Is this stuff worth anything to anybody????"
177323,Disspatcher,2008-03-27 10:13:00,73,"Its the captains! Dougie.Wendel & Darryl Sittler.....and the stick....Id say it might have more of a sentimental value. But if you want a dollar value, you might get 30 - 50 bucks on ebay."
177353,Stoty,2008-03-27 12:34:00,2910,"Disspatcher is right, its Gilmour, Clark, Sittler.  Doug Gilmour Wendel Clark Darryl Sittler"
177418,tibbs,2008-03-27 14:32:00,650,"Alright, thanks guys!  I have no intention on selling it since i already have quite the collection of hockey stuff.  Thanks again!"
