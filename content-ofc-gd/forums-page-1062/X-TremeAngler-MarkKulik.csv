He had a full schedule as it was but made the appointment with us on time. We exchanged the usual pleastenries and it turned into one of those situations where you just wished you had more time. We spoke about all canadian content and where their show is headed and what not and more.... Sounds like one heck of a season to come and I for one are looking forward to it. We havent fished together yet but I know it is a foregone conclusion... We will be...... Thanks Mark......it made the topper of the day! Take Care..Speak soon. Peter
