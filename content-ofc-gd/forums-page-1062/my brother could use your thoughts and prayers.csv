I just got off the phone with my brothers wife and it sounds like they want to operate on Thurs and put in a kind of pacemaker to regulate the heart. Want to get his strength up before they operate so thurs looks like the day if all goes well Sounds like he will be there for at least a week I will update when I know some more I am hoping my next update will be that the operation went well Fingers crossed   Thanks again to all for the well wishes and for Johnf for the offer This is truely a great community  Rick

176176,cthewrld,2008-03-25 16:58:00,99,"Rick, I have had both a pacemaker, and an internal defibrillator put into my body.  One (the pacemaker) keeps my heart from going below a certain number of beats per minute.  The other (the defibrillator) is designed to shock my heart back into a normal rhythm if I go into ventricular or atrial fibrillation (abnormally high and erratic heartbeat).  The surgery is a breeze.  It is usually day surgery.  The recovery is around 3 - 4 days.  Depending on what he is having done, he may not be able to drive for around a month, or raise his left arm above his shoulder for a month.  Other than that, he should be good, and should consider himself lucky to have not had any other problems at this point.  I hope the point of view from someone who has been through it helps."
176180,steve_paul,2008-03-25 17:03:00,658,"Rickster, best wishes to your brother and our thoughts are for his speedy recovery.  Like others have said, my boss had this procedure done a couple of years ago and has recovered fully."
