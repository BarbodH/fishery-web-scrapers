I can only imagine the contributions of members and mods from years past.  Thank you for providing a great service, we are all in your debt.  reefrunner"

IF I were a vegetable and had to surf the web with a pen wedged in between my lips, I'd only need one default page...  Thanx everyone. merci, mille fois, merci.  HD"
177299,ehg,2008-03-27 03:55:00,2666,"I would concur with that sentiment.  In the 4-5 yrs that i've participated here ( in a low- key way), met some good people, gained some computer savvy and learned a little more about  fishing and life.  Thanks,  ehg"

Those posts were great motivation to get off my azz and get out on the water...I guess the weather really hasn't been in your favour this year , but more reason to take up steelheading..... carefull though, its more of a disease than a hobby!!"
