177249,kickingfrog,2008-03-27 02:13:00,8333,Sounds like there may be a bit of a run on sunglasses at Costco over the next couple of days. Good thing I need a 100 rolls of paper towels and 20lbs of rice as well.
177277,GbayGiant,2008-03-27 02:55:00,1780,"I'm currently looking for my first high quality polarized as well, I've narrowed it down on ebay. You can find many for under $100, under $50 depending how high you want, that are worth 2 or three times that retail. Lot's in Canada as well not just US on there to save the hassle of shipping through customs..  Bolle Serengeti Oakley Smith Spy Arnette Maui-Jim Ray-Ban Coasta Del Mar   Any of these brands have many options in Polarized, I'm personally going with a Photochromic Polarized lense in bronze, brown or grey. All of those brands above are high quality and usually half price more or less on ebay."
177326,Canuck,2008-03-27 10:25:00,491,"I was down in Florida a couple of weeks back and shopped a bit.  Prices in Canada are now just as good as down there.  I bought a set of Maui-Jims at Costco last year for my wife as a B-Day present.  About $140 I think - thats a bargain for M-J's.   A couple of weeks later she got them and she LOVES them.  They are polarized amber lenses.  Only problem is that Costco sold out and did not get any back so I wasn't able to get a pair for my self.  If they ever come back at that price I will snap them up for sure.  If they ever break, M-J replaces them for $50 or so (according to web site legend and the folks at sunglasses hut in Orlando that tried to sell me the same glasses my wife has for US$249.00."

177473,mepps,2008-03-27 16:25:00,1301,dont forget to check ebay...
177532,sneak_e_pete,2008-03-27 18:40:00,540,Thanks for all of the advice and comments!  I really appreciate it. I found Blue Water glasses at a local tackle shop and picked up a pair....they look like they'll be awesome.
176963,huntervasili,2008-03-26 19:39:00,1604,"I personally have 4 pairs of polarized glasses... 2 of them are Maui Jim's (one amber lens the other in smoke) and then a pair of cheap sunglasses, strike kings I believe, which run about $20 a pop in both amber and smoke... I have yet to break the Maui jim glasses and have had em for a couple years and use em on the water ALOT and they no doubt outperform the 20$ pairs, which I have broken/lost 3 pairs in the past year and a half. It all has to do with how you treat them, If you care about them you will go out of your way to protect them and they will serve you a long time. If you have cheapies you dont care about well heck you'll toss em here and there, no second thought if they fall unprotected out of your pocket onto the gravel. Thats just how it works. Now as for quality Vs. price, I think that you definitely have to look at the law of diminishing returns because it holds true... you can start to pay for style this and that material etc. and you will find what you want and dont want. Remember though some people are fully satisfied with their $20 optics while others wont touch them because they know what they'll be missing. One thing though I would suggest is TRY THEM ON I have gives some of mine away because they press too hard on my temples and after the day hurt like an dude, ya can't very well adjust the plastic frame. As well consider the TYPE OF FISHING you are doing. If you are going to be doing mainly deepwater trolling and the like, you need protection from the Uv rays and sun, whereas if you are sight fishing for bass or checking out structure on the rivers you need to have a quality pair of glasses. Hopefully you got something from this long winded response. Good luck in your search!"
177061,Canuck2fan,2008-03-26 22:23:00,1444,"I started out with a pair of south bend Walmart cheapies and they were polarized and did work fine. I saw a pair of uvex polarized glasses at Costco for 39.99 I asked to try them on and they fit great the optician even helped adjust them making them even more comfortable. I said I will take them. She then took out a box and opened up.... For the 40 bucks I also got another two pairs of lens and a carrying case.... All the lens are polarized, grey, amber and rose. So on the low light days I put in the amber and on the really bright days the grey and I just haven't used the rose yet (supposed to be great for driving though) but they are there if I ever need them.  I found out later that Uvex specializes in safety glasses which probably explains why these glasses are so tough. I have had my buddies do the branch in the face trick many times. I have dropped them on rocks, sand, ice and asphalt and I have yet to see a scratch on any of the lenses...  Also if I lose them or break them I can live the price."
177065,Bernie,2008-03-26 22:41:00,3190,I also need regular glasses for reading (and tyeing up fishing line). Recently found out that safety glasses are now available with bifocals. So I checked to see if they also came shaded. Low and behold--they do. So I ordered 3 pair in varying focal strength. For the tidy sum of $6 bucks each. They fit pretty good. Fully adjustable like most safety glasses.  Now if could just convince them to polarize them.
177103,Fishnfiend,2008-03-26 23:25:00,357, That sounds to be about the best deal going.  Off to Costco I go.
177113,Zubris21,2008-03-26 23:32:00,563,"Thanks for starting this thread!  I appreciate all the info.  I've heard lots about polarized glasses and never really thought much about it.  However after hearing some of the reviews I think I'm going to go get a pair of the cheap rapala's to keep in my tackle box.  My question to all of you, is how do polarized glasses compare to standard sun glasses (for example I have Oakley's) in terms of protecting your eyes from UV damage.  I know that you get what you paid for, but does the polarization filter interfere with the UV filters? Or are they combined even on the lower end products?  -fwf"

177239,BillM,2008-03-27 02:03:00,17367,I am going to have to take a trip to CostCo!  I love the fact of having one pair of glasses with multiple lenses...  Thanks for the info guys!
177241,muskymike,2008-03-27 02:04:00,772, I second that. I will be there tomorrow to have a look.
