177667,jdmls,2008-03-27 23:52:00,575,"if your really want to get the best presentation, you needle your line through the body coming out the other end then tie the hook leaving about half an inch of line between the worm and the hook eye. Or if your lazy like me just rig it wacky right through the centre !"

177696,MuddyWater,2008-03-28 00:31:00,218,just hook em and use em they can really be deadly sometimes
