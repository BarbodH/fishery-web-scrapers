I know for a fact I was fishing legally, and I would have wondered the same thing if I was you.  So no hard feelings on that man.  To the guy who was mad that I didn't reveal my location: Isn't that why it is called a secret spot? Because nobody else knows of it? So if I come on here and say I caught 20+ fish and told you where I was......would you not head there the next time you went out? Absolutely and so would the rest of Ontario.  Just relax man you'll find spots like that, all you have to do is look at a map and then check your regulations....simple  To everyone else: I am glad that you enjoy looking at my posts and hope to see you on the river....and if I find you in my spot than thats AWESOME that you found it.....just don't tell the world but that understandable right?  Till next time,  Hawk"
