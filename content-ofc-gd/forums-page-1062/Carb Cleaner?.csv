Just wanted to double check as the Mechanic I spoke to said he was not 100% sure. Thanks in advance  Bill"
177553,dannyboy,2008-03-27 19:24:00,367,I have been using SeaFoam for a while and it works great to de-carb my outboards. You can buy it at most Carquest stores. Website  Dan

177555,2 tone z71,2008-03-27 19:27:00,1311,ALSO works extremly well
177578,aplumma,2008-03-27 20:37:00,6896,Bill use the seafoam product regular carb cleaner will strip te oil off of the pistons and you can stick a ring or damage it. The chances are low but why take a chance. Use the seafoam as per the directions to mix it with the gas/oil mixture. A little down the carb will clean the throat but it is not going to clean the fuel passages ie carberator etc.. After the run replace the plug and fuel filter both will be dirty as can be. You might also consider getting a better grade of oil if you are carboning up quickly. I have run Marine amsoil 2 stroke oil for years with no fouling or issues with gunk.   Uncle Arttie
177580,Sinker,2008-03-27 20:38:00,8692,"Yup, seafoam!  I use the mercury power tuner for a quick carbon clean out......amazing how much crap comes out!!   Sinker"
177618,boatman,2008-03-27 21:44:00,350, It'll only rob the engine of lubrication. You can also get Seafoam at NAPA.
177624,huntervasili,2008-03-27 21:56:00,1604,Great... I will grab the seafoam and try to find an OMC/BRP dealer in the hamilton burlington area... any one know of one?
177625,sonny,2008-03-27 21:58:00,511,"It all depends on what you want to do...cleaning the throttle bore with carb cleaner is about the only thing that i would recommend and even be carefull doing that to a two stroke...For cleaning the carberator a dismantal and soak is the best way to go.. Now for dcarbonizing the combustion chamber is all together different,,for that i would recommend an approved cleaner in your gas."
177629,huntervasili,2008-03-27 22:03:00,1604,"Ok, well I don't want to risk breaking anything so what should I do? Keep in mind it is running well at the current time, just a little rough on lower idles"
177638,Sinker,2008-03-27 22:27:00,8692,"I'd run the seafoam thru it. The stuff works wonders. Try it, you'll be impressed.  The mercury power tuner can be used in a Johnson as well, and its available at any merc dealer. It comes in a spray can, and you spray it right down the carb until it stalls out.......let it sit for 15-30 mins, then take it for a rip at WOT.......it always blows my mind how much crud comes out of the engine......and it really smooths out the idle on mine. I do it every fall before I put it away.  P.S.....I put seafoam in every tank of gas in my boat. It also works as a stabilizer for the fuel.  Sinker"
177647,boatman,2008-03-27 22:51:00,350,"If your problem is at idle then nothing you spray in the carb will fix it. A fuel treatment might, but don't hold too much faith in it. However, a decarb is worth doing anyway so do it first and if there is no change then its time to clean the carb. Of course, this is assuming that you have already tried setting the low speed adjustment on the carb, but it hasn't fixed the problem.  NAPA up on the mountain has Seafoam. I like to buy my parts at Bay City Marine on Hester."
