For those that have never heard of DB Cooper...Google his name, its a very interesting story. At least I think so.  Heres the link to the parachute story... DB Coopers Parachute?"

There was some of the ransom money found by some kids a number of years back.  This guy was saying that the money could not have made its way from where the chute was found to where the money was found ... naturally that is.  Who knows, maybe the guy buried the chute and lost some of his cash during the get-away.  Sounds like they are opening this case up again, with the finding of the chute.  It will be interesting to hear what the final verdict is.  I've always wondered if he really made it or not."
