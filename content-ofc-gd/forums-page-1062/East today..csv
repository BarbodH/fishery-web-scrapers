Slow start to the day only hooking a few in the Am but as soon as the afternoon rolled around and it warmed up and the water became a slight stained color it picked up. Run off due to the melt was key. Most fish were hit on roe but a few came on flys. Forgot the camera on the trib so heres a pic of the hen that was harvested for roe and the smoker taken in the backyard.  Tight lines, RF "

The one good thing about all the snow this year is that you dont always have to wait for a rain....just have to spend the time to check conditions as they can change within a short period of time.
