176056,Vanselena,2008-03-25 12:35:00,269,"Time to get the creative thinking caps on and win a set of 4 Torpedo Divers We will be giving away 4 Torpedo Divers to the winning logo and 4 Torpedo Divers to the winning catch phrase.  Here are some advantages of the Torpedo Diver to help with your creative thinking.  Torpedo Divers have very low drag and can be reeled in quickly. The angler is able quickly retrieve lines then put the boat in neutral and play the fish. Multiple lures can be placed on the same line and therefor increases the chances of catching fish. Any line can used Any depth can be reached depending on boat speed. Reaching depths does not require long leads e.g.: 40 feet of water can be reached with a 47 foot line lead at 2.5mph This method can be used on itâ€™s own or with planer or mini planer boards. Depths are determined by Torpedo used, boat speed and fishing line used, giving the angler many variables to fish with. The design causes the Diver to stay in the same position, which keeps the lure in the strike zone. The drag is minimal therefor the angler can hold the rod in their hands and experience the first strike of the fish. Any rod can be used Torpedoâ€™s look like baitfish and attract fish Torpedoâ€™s help set the hook and keep it set even if the angler doesnâ€™t keep the line tight.  Good luck to all!  Contest closes March 30th at Midnight EST"

176189,Terry,2008-03-25 17:21:00,14456,would help if we knew something about the product....  does it go in-line  how many feet in front of the lure or does it use a 3way swivel  and go under the lure......  what features make it better/different then other diving products
176212,Vanselena,2008-03-25 17:59:00,269,"Hi Terry,  Normally you would use a 3 way swivel and have a leader line to your lure. Another method is to put out a long lead line say 200 feet and then clip the Torpedo Diver to your fishing line and attach an elastic band stopper, when the fish hits simply disconnect the Torpedo or break the elastic band and let it slide down to your swivel where your floro leader is. Another advantage is you do not have a release and therefor you do not get false releases, also if a shaker is on you will know it. And yet another advantage is you can see your lures action since the Torpedo does not cause hardly any drag and therefor you will know if you have weeds etc on your lure. I could go on but here is another off the top of my head. No need to waste time at the boat launch putting on downriggers, just launch and go.  Hope this helps to get the creative juices flowing!"
