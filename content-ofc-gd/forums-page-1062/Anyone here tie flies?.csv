177219,workwear,2008-03-27 01:37:00,592,boy do i envy you.......gonna try some bone fish too??  keep us posted!!!
177221,irishfield,2008-03-27 01:41:00,26272,I think those might work great for some Ontario fish too Jamie... send me a dozen would ya !
177227,Crazyhook,2008-03-27 01:46:00,1154,"going to try the bones if they are around... Tarpon and shark are number one on the list though   Wayne, we got room in the cabin! going to make some flies for musky and pike ( top pattern) may try with a circle hook..."
177228,brickNblock,2008-03-27 01:47:00,598,"Hey Bud..... I loved the 2 in the last pic on the lower right The chartruese and the Blk/w,white w/the eye. I hope they do great for ya....... I fished the tribs most of my life........ Normally I just used worms til I got a few damged females to tie roe.l Fished yarn for the longest time as well. One of my fav's was the woolley-buggar When I got hooked by the lunge bug too my surprise one of the first I ever caught was on a 11"" wooleyBuggar I tied myself......(approx2oz) Actually ,most of my selftied inlines are just larger versions of the smaller trout flies. Its a wonderful world when things meet like that> Nice flies CzHk..... best of luck in the south with them. bNb"
177230,irishfield,2008-03-27 01:50:00,26272,I was thinkin they might work great for them big Nipigon Specks up Danc's way !
177233,Crazyhook,2008-03-27 01:55:00,1154,"size 2 hook, they are about 4-5"""
177237,kickingfrog,2008-03-27 02:00:00,8333,Tie 'em? I can barely zip mine sometimes.  Very nice.
177295,MJL,2008-03-27 03:40:00,2427,"Crazyhook those are great flies.  They look like fish catchers to me.  If you have time, you can try coating the eyes and heads with 30min epoxy for added durability against sharp teeth and coral...You'll find your flies will last a little bit longer.  Here are some patterns I tied for my pike fishing which might work well for your trip.  All are about 4-5"" tied on size 2 mustad signature hooks.  Down deep clouser   Deceivers (white + white & chartreuse)     Blue + white Polar fiber minnow (head and stick-on eyes coated with epoxy) - very easy tie and has a tantalizing darting action when stripped. "
177300,Crazyhook,2008-03-27 03:56:00,1154,"nice work!!! loev the last one... looks like an "" EAT ME"" pattern"
177307,mepps,2008-03-27 04:44:00,1301,"You guys both did a great job!  I havent started tyign yet, but I will soon!  When I was fishing tarpon in the BVI I met a couple fly fishermen they said chartuce is key.  One of they guys is a pretty big name in fly fishing and has stops to making some tarpon flys on his site in the article section - check it out...  Jack Gartside Flys  If I remember correctly, he also said a shirmp imitation fly was key."
177348,Jacques,2008-03-27 12:20:00,97,I'd eat 'em.
177369,wuchikubo,2008-03-27 13:04:00,1114,"MJL beat me to it, I was just thinking about suggesting to coat the heads a bit more, they seem to be exposed a bit for toothy fish.  MJL, those are some nice flies as well.  Now, I think I'm going to take my vise out and tie some flies if I can get some quiet time here.  Thanks for the posts."
177373,RangerGuy,2008-03-27 13:11:00,564,Those are some real nice looking flies.  Good job
177497,Kirk,2008-03-27 17:10:00,347,"It's been probably two years since I tied some flies, but these nice pics have got me thinking about my vice again.  As for the patterns, to quote Pete Bowman from a talk many years ago, when they are 'on' you can put cigarette butts on hooks and haul em in."
177500,highdrifter,2008-03-27 17:12:00,2534,Not Bad!  but where's the cockroach pattern?  I'm told this pattern produces a lot in the keys...  And don't forget about lefty's deceivers!!  Good luck!
177725,Crazyhook,2008-03-28 01:07:00,1154,Highdrifter... cockroach is the next one I am going to tie and the tarpon toad.. I have been told these will be good for cudas ... tarpon a bit more picky...
