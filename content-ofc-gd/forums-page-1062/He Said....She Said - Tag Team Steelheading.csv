Danbouck...thanks...but what were you thinking asking that!!!  hahaha   And Carol...we haven't met yet...but I do look forward to it one day..hopefully soon.  Sometimes, one just does not realize what an impact they have on another...and what better time to tell you that I honestly respect and appreciate all your posts.  I am learning so much...maybe it does have something to do with us being of the same sex...but I look forward to a post from you...daily!!  Thank you so much for sharing all that you have and I so hope that you will continue to do so.  Nancy"

177107,douG,2008-03-26 23:27:00,2693,"There are some new members that don't quite get the point here on this board.  If you have something to say, say it, then back off.  That's the end of the deal.  If you didn't write clearly the first time, fix it in another post.  You've stated your opinion, and made your point clear.  That should be the end of the whole thing, unless there are other issues that you need to work out.   Please move those issues to some other forum.  This is how we get along here.  If you don't like that sorta method for getting ahead, go ahead and try something else.  We don't need to hear about gps duels at 40 paces.  Especially the personal comments and insults.  This is definitely the last resort of a limited mind.  Some boards have a rule that you cannot use any other member's name in your post.  We don't do that here, because we like to be able to say, ""Nice fish, Nater"", for example.  But a directed negative comment, such as ""U R such a losr!!!!!!  OMG!!!!!!!!!  U dont 3vn wa$h you're pwnd laundry, fisherdooderino_666"", really looks sorta stoopid.  Move it up a notch, or move along."

Milty...You dont use a net, good for you. Its not a crime to use one.  Then again, by the looks of your avatar picture, there is no need to net a fish that small."

177003,Cory,2008-03-26 20:45:00,170,So......   A baby seal walked into a club.........
176601,richyb,2008-03-26 05:35:00,774,"Hey milty ... not trying to get on your bad side but when you say using a net is unsporting , then why arent you out there fishing with a line and stick the way fishing started out , instead of your 10 foot rods and special reels ..Its not like they are out there just netting fish.. A net has been used to land fish for decades...Its like telling a golfer hes not allowed to use a driver, you can play a round of golf without it but some people would rather have it ...   If you want to bash someone go on youtube and watch how people handle fish there. One guys comment on there was "" oh a pike is like a catfish it can live out of water for 20 or more minutes no problem""  That was posted on a video of a guy posing for pics and video for 5 minutes or more with his 30 pounder. That would be a post to get cranky about ..... not because someone used a net .. . .. I enjoy reading the posts on here about everyones success net or no net. congrats on the fish Bly ....  keep the posts coming !!!!!"
176607,MJL,2008-03-26 06:28:00,2427,"WTG C & C on your trip.  Those are some real monsters.  As far as nets go, on most occasions I don’t use one.  My rubber net is heavy and it’s another thing to carry…I’m lazy. If I’m alone and a fish takes me for a run downstream, most likely I’ll forget about the net during the chase.  Nets however are good for: - Minimizing the length of time needed to play a fish.  Whether or not it’s sporting or unsporting, it’s really up to the angler to decide.  I’ve seen hundreds upon hundreds of anglers (both experienced and inexperienced) attempt to tail or beach fish only to fight them to exhaustion.  Some fish just don’t quit (Skamania are prime examples) and some anglers just don’t know how to tail a fish.  Lactic acid build up is one of the primary reasons why catch and release doesn’t work 100% of the time even when they swim off – It’s delayed mortality. Get them in quick and release them quick. When temps are warmer (eg post opener), it’s more of a bigger deal to land them quick before they exhaust themselves to the point of no return.  - Landing fish on shelf ice – If you’re 5’7” like I am standing over an 8’ deep pool on unstable shelf ice trying to land a fish, a net should be with you.  It also makes a great rescue pole.  I personally favour the fine-meshed and rubber nets for my angling."
176609,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-26 07:57:00,1183,"Congratulations Cliff on your PB...I enjoyed reading about your day...the surprise meeting up with Bly   Bly, you are giving me confidence as I will be out there by myself in the coming months.  Thanks for sharing.  But right now I feel so agitated and aaagggrrresssive...   Maybe I too need to get laid...HAHAHAHA...SORRY that was not nice...I do apologize Uncle."
176612,solopaddler,2008-03-26 08:42:00,8605," Hey, I do that LOL! (but not thrown on the ground and always either on snow, rocks or in the river, never mud..) I've been at it for quite a long time and personally have never carried a net, only a tailing glove, although there is the odd occasion when I wish I had one. I'd personally never criticise anyone who uses a net, each to their own...  Now more importantly great post Cliff and Bly!, beauty fish!  ."
176613,jonnybass,2008-03-26 09:29:00,346,"Milty makes valid points. I'm not sure why you are all slamming him.  This is a fishing forum, is it not? He has offered great advice aimed at helping to sustain our great resource. Sure, his comments were directed at a couple of popular members here with high post counts, but what does that have to do with the validity of his point? He's absolutely right! Those nets generally shouldn't be used on Steelhead. Plain and simple. Everyone knows that.  Having said that, I am more concerned about the safety of Bly and Cliff fishing by themselves under those conditions. So I can live with them using a net in that scenario."

176540,kemper,2008-03-26 02:39:00,2232,Awesome as always guys!  Are you going to be able to get out tomorrow? Ill be at the usual spot from around 12 noon untill the fish arent biting anymore tomorrow.  Hopefully see one or both out there!

176554,ccmtcanada,2008-03-26 03:21:00,7971," We figure these are the same fish that swim by piers...so if nets are good for those guys.....  Netting them means they are not as tired as we get them out of the water sooner.  Thanks for the tip though, but I think we'll stick to what we are comfortable with."

176557,danbouck,2008-03-26 03:24:00,4380,  Why are nets bad?
176559,Milty,2008-03-26 03:31:00,121,"ok,..no worries,...its up to you how much you want to harm the fish,unless of course you arent returning it to the water.....after all its within your rights when you pay your $29 for a license.....just do everyone else and the fish a fovour and get a proper net for them steelies, if you feel the need to use one......fair enough ???...its a sad sad day when you cant take a helpful hint...regardless of all the kudos you get from your friends on this board,..it doesnt change the harm you may be doing becasue you dont want to do it right,...becasue you see guys at the peir hurting the fish,..does thast make it right?     How many steelheaders do u see with a net?  there is a reason,..do some research if you dont know what I mean,...on a creek that size,..there is absolutely NO need!!!"
