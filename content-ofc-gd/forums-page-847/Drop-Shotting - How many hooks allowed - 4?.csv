342420,charlesn,2009-05-17 17:30:00,551,"If you're going to use multiple hooks on a drop shot rig, be careful as a palomar knot (generally the knot used to tie on the hook of a drop shot rig) is not intended to be stressed from the tag end of the line.  That's why weights are often clipped on the end so that in a snag situation, you lose the weight and not the whole rig.  I have tried double rigs for small fish like perch, but I really did not find any more effectiveness compared to a single hook.  For smallmouth, I wouldn't try it because if you hook up a fish of a lifetime on the bottom hook, you're trusting a knot partway up the line that was not intended for that purpose.  Just my experience with it.  Charles"
