342395,jediangler,2009-05-17 16:20:00,1923,Do you mean Conestogo lake north west of Elmira? There is no lake by that name anywhere near Cambridge.Here is a link.  http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cf...=123&sub2=0
342398,sneak_e_pete,2009-05-17 16:44:00,540,"Yes, sorry, that's the one."
342403,jediangler,2009-05-17 16:49:00,1923,"Supposed to be pike and bass in there as well as some panfish species. Also carp, suckers and catfish if bottom feeders are what you're after. Too many people just burning gas, jetskiers, water skiers, and people just generally ripping around for a kayaker like myself to enjoy the lake. Might be alot nicer on a weekday."
