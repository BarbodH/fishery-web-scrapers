But I'm wondering if anyone has first hand experience with it.  I like the idea of it...but I'm afraid it might be too soft to walk on with harder soled boots like rubber boots or hunting boots without tearing the material up. Anybody have any thoughts on it?  http://www.marineflooring.net/contact-us.html
