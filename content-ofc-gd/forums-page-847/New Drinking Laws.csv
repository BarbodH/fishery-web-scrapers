342254,irishfield,2009-05-17 01:00:00,26272," What are you ""sorry"" about. Like I said.. when they added DWI/DUI to ""boating"" they added it as a vessel. Not a motorized vessel, motorized boat... simply vessel and vessel covers everything right down to a hand tied log raft."
342255,knightfisher,2009-05-17 01:03:00,237," Last year in Toronto tasers were used 367 times. I find it hard to believe the Police would of shot that many people in one year if they didn't have tasers. The RCMP used their tasers 1106 times in 2008. Again, hard to believe there would of been that many shooting by them. In the past police would use billy clubs or what ever to try and over power someone. Today with these tasers there's no need to, just zap the person instead. I f an officer feels his life is being threatened I can understand the use of guns or tasers, but the use of tasers are being used way to much.  In Quebec this year the government band all tasers because a number of them were putting out way to much volts.  Also in 2007 the United Nations reported that the use of tasers is a form of torture.  Added to this, all the people that died as a result of being tasered, yet most of the deaths have been attributed to something else....would that mean all those people that died as a result of the taser, would of died at exactly the same time anyway..... I don't think so."

I mean, i am ALL for safety and believe that people who put others' lives at needless risk should be held responsible.....but some of the recent provincial laws are really crazy.  Even if you're okay with the laws, teh way they are implemented (no judge or jury) is pretty ridiculous.  I'm voting conservative next election."
342265,ColdH20guy,2009-05-17 01:44:00,312, good for you;I`m sure that will change everything

Oh hell yeah!!!...  ... or maybe you'd like to get a good buzz on and hop the fence to the polar bear enclosure at the zoo... so you could pet them!... maybe you'd like to swim with the Great White sharks at Sea World with dead Mackerals tied to your ankles after one too many???"

342278,keram,2009-05-17 02:20:00,585," First of all, sorry to dissect your post, but I do not agree with anything you have said ( I hope I can have my own opinion )  Not all Police Officers carry Tazer's in Ontario, just so you know No I do not know and your statement means nothing unless you can provide  some into ( who ?, why ?, when ? )  And a tazer saves lives, cause if there was no tazers and a police officer had to protect himself he would shoot.  So you are saying that a tazer is for police to protect themselves ?. Did you hear about any case in which police officer died or was seriously injured because he/she did not use a taser? I've heard just opposite -""the criminal was dead""  I would rather be tazed than shot!!  This really makes me laugh.. How about not doing anything stupid enough so the police does not have to pick between a tazer and bullet?  They wouldn't make these laws if idiots would stop doing stupid things on the water drunk!  Its like a stupid warning on a product, they wouldn't put it on there if someone didn't do it!  Well. lets make 99% of normal people follow the same rules like 1% stupid. Brilliant idea. just wait little bit longer and when you've farted, you will be charged not for or a smell ( too normal  ) , but for excessive GHG emission"
342283,Fudd,2009-05-17 02:28:00,94," Well it is alot stricter here in Australia and boy do they enforce it. In the past 2 weeks i can think of 2 days that i was not stopped for a breathalyzer. They set up all the time, i am in a small town so maybe the police have nothing to do but. On the water it is just as enforced.  I dunno, i agree with the motorized boater but i think this is going to far. I always thought the reason for a law was to protect the public?? I should have the right to do what i want as long as it has no effect on anyone but myself. If i don't want to wear a helmut when cycling or paddle a canoe in the back country after having 3 beers then i should be able to. This is just the government trying to control the people once again. I really feel for the officers that have to enforce this stupidity, they are the ones that are going to take the brunt of the abuse for just doing there jobs."
342284,charlied,2009-05-17 02:31:00,584,ok then tell me...would you rather have that many tazered or 10% of that shot and killed!!!  Come on now.  Police are trained to protect themselves first!  I would do the same thing!
342286,charlied,2009-05-17 02:39:00,584,"Well I actually do know about this cause I am learning it in school, by real police officers!

342301,cisco,2009-05-17 04:09:00,597,"I congratulate the police and MADD for almost elliminating drunk driving.  I feel it's the PR and propoganda 'experts' who prepare media reports of things like roadside checks who are trying to make things look untruthful.  Results have become very slim from TV reports I've heard.  Extremely few DUI's are evident these days. So they 'up' the looks to impress readers by saying things like ""Two temporary suspensions were issued and 14 unfit vehicles were pulled off the road""  Joke is that the 'unfit' vehicles were largely vehicles just ticketed for small stuff like a turnlight not working.  Police seem to have a harder time catching really bad folks so have upped their ability to nail folks for peanut offences so results seem impressive or at least tolerable enough for citizens not to complain about poor policing.  I have also noticed that during a TV news item on a murder, often I hear that ""The victim was known to police.""  Guess that's supposed to help the public towards believing the murder is not such a big deal....  Like in Montreal where police reps are claiming the ticket 'quota' was raised to 26 from 18, here the .05 is going to impress citizens by the press releases offering better statistics about roadside checks.  Budgets would be cut if it was ever found how reduced impaired driving was, so by lowering the bar the police are able to justify keeping..... and probably INCREASING their budget.  To change the bar so drivers are nailed more $$ and 3 day suspensions, etc. re the .05 thing, I would have hoped to see police data demonstrating that drivers with .05 have been responsible for whatever damage which justifies the change.  Again, I congratulate the police and MADD on reducing impaired driving.  As result I suggest budgets shrink to reflect reduced need for roadside checks..... but that is against the corporate goal of increasing budgets/power. Use the $$ to better go after drug trafficers or vehicle theft rings."

Not gonna say more or less because those who don't understand are the first to cast stones.  After reading this sentence I think you are in wrong bussiness. You should be politician. But I will bite, just share it, so I and few others (unwashed) can understand and save the stone for somebody else"

342132,Photoz,2009-05-16 14:48:00,792,"I'm a non drinker, and although I agree with MOST of the new driving / drinking regulations . . .   there are SOME that I feel are BEYOND ridiculous. If I hadn't seen & heard this, directly out of O. P. P. Sgt. Dave Woodford's mouth on the CTV news, then on Channel 24, from another high ranking cop, I'd think someone was telling a bad joke! There has been a law in place that sets out pretty much the same penalties for being over .08 while operating a motorized watercraft, as there is for operating a motor vehicle . . . .   which I don't have a problem with. The new law that just came into being  (on the spot suspensions for .05) now applies to watercraft too, same as land vehicles. BUT . . . .    this is where it gets kinda ridiculous . . .   .     these police spokespersons went on to say that ALL of these laws (new & old) also appiled to UNMOTORIZED watercraft too. The rather surprised interviewer then specifically asked if the laws now applied to watercraft such as canoes, rowboats etc., and was assured they did? I wonder where they draw the line . . .   perhaps 'impaired operation of an air mattress?' 'Impaired operation of an inner tube?' Again, this was on the CTV news AND CP 24, and the information was VERY clearly given by 2 well-known police spokesmen. Did anybody else see or hear this? Or read up on the new regulations? I find it hard to believe someone, paddling their l'il Sportspal canoe, on some beaver pond, technically could be hit with the same penalty for being over .08, as somebody driving a car in a school zone, also at over .08? Please tell me these guys made a mistake?"

It seems to me the gov't is trying to have it both ways, they want almost zero tolerance (which id be fine with) while still allowing people to drink some and not pissing off the bar and restaurant owners too much.  When this got into the news last year it was being said at that time, that if you get a warning and a suspension you still wouldn't have a criminal record because the legal limit is .08, but your insurance company would get a report of your warning and your insurance would triple or more.  How can it be legal to punish people with fines and what not when they haven't gone over the legal limit? or then again have they?, is .05 the new limit? It's a pretty strange law imo.  If the gov't is serious about reducing drinking and driving why don't they just lower the legal limit from .08 to .05 or lower?"
