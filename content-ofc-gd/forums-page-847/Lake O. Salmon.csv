342645,icefisherman,2009-05-18 18:38:00,952,"Started early (6am) got the first fish by 6:30 ...then 4:30 hours of burning gas and washing lures anywhere from 120 to 240 fow. As soon as my son woke up bam...two more fish in the boat and shortly after we went home. Tried again deep water and flies...couldn't get any volunteers...not sure how others get fish at 100' or more down...all my came at 40-60' down on 8 colors leadcore and rigger at 60' down. So spoon bite only...lots of boats out there...saw one boat getting fish...lots of radio chat and from what I've heard 1-2 fish per boat....for some reason when weather is nice and I go fishing bite changes and it takes a lot of running around to prevent getting skunked....still looking  for that nice and easy day when bite is at prime. Here are two of today's fish. Forgot to take picture of the third one. 13 Lbs, 7 Lbs/ 10 Lbs. Three hits - three fish.      Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
