Last time I had one put on was through U-Haul and it was pretty expensive and I didn't really like their customer service, so I am hoping to go through another outfit.  Any suggestions? I am in Dunnville, so somewhere around there would be ideal (Hamilton). However, my boat is located in London so London would work also.  Thanks for any help guys."
340973,irishfield,2009-05-13 03:37:00,26272,Just google Trailer Hitch ....... (city) and start calling.  Here's one in London  http://www.trailerhitch.ca/

If you are somewhat handy you can do it yourself. These days most vehicles just ""plug and play"" for the wiring part. The hitch part is not that difficult....if I can do my van....anyone can  FT"
340982,MillerPhoto,2009-05-13 03:53:00,147,"Every vehicle model uses a different hitch, I would reccomend Van & Truck World.. They usually carry common ones in stock, but if they do not have it, they can normally get it with in 3 business days. I used to work for them for 3 years as a Tech in Cobourg. Prices are usually the cheapest but quality the highest.. They deal with alot of bulk so there prices are lower then most places.  Uhaul uses alot of universal hitches.. and the load rating is much lower and the design is bad.. Hidden Hitch which Van & Truck World carrys the most.. I beleive the company was bought out so the hitches are called something else now, but they are designed to be hidden.  Just give them a call ahead of time, and they can make sure to have the hitch and wiring in stock and setup an appointment with you.

341049,bigpikemike,2009-05-13 14:57:00,52,no overdrive even if u r towing a 14ft princecraft tinny with a jeep grand cherokee with a 190hp??????.....really cuz i always wondered....cuz it could only weigh about 6-700lbs all together....lets say lees then a 1000lbs to be safe

342031,MillerPhoto,2009-05-16 02:23:00,147,"You can check out Hidden Hitch which shows you the auctual hitch what it looks like. It does not require drilling and uses factory holes, and the hitch hides behind the bumper. so all you will see is the square tube reciever in the middle. Personally it is a job you could do yourself in a hour or two of time at home. But defaintly check on the price at van and truck world for the hitch and wiring.. defaintly cheaper then canadian tire.. and probly still cheaper then uhaul.  Don't forget its not the old school wiring, you need the light converter..  any vehicle that has the amber turn signal seperate from the brake light bulbs..  Here you can see the part numer and even shows you the light converter. http://www.hiddenhitch.com/fitguides/hitch...mp;partno=87422  As for the question on overdrive during hauling.. Not worth having it on unless you have 10km+ of flat highway with no traffic.... which you will not find in ontario! haha"
