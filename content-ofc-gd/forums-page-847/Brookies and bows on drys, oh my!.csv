341467,BillM,2009-05-14 17:34:00,17367,"Was fortunate enough to receive an unofficial fly lesson yesterday.  I think I got the hang of it pretty quickly (less muscle, more form) and had an absolute blast for the 4hrs we were out.  Let's just say the conditions were prime.  No worries of tangled lines in trees (although it happened once or twice), the fish were eating up everything, and the weather actually co-operated...    Thanks again Dave!  It was a blast...       "
341469,Beats,2009-05-14 17:37:00,543,"Wow, all those from your first 4 hrs of fly fishing?  That's about as good as it gets."
341470,BillM,2009-05-14 17:39:00,17367,"I forgot to add, those are ALL of Dave's fish.  I was catching dink brookies and bows all night.  The two big fish unfortunately came on artificals."
341471,wallacio,2009-05-14 17:48:00,475,"Bill,  That was good fun.   I was impressed at how quickly you were able to get the casting stroke down after only minimal instruction.  What a night for an introduction to dry fly fishing - just remember it's not always that easy...usually the fish are far less willing!!!"
341493,highdrifter,2009-05-14 19:18:00,2534,"Nice Bill!!  You can go ahead and put the pin away now..  Cause ya know, purists have no love for pinners!!  cheers HD"
341494,Victor,2009-05-14 19:21:00,1609,The markings and colors are just stunning on these fish. I have always wanted to learn how to work a fly combo as well.  Nice job and congrats on catching your first fish on the fly rod!
341498,BillM,2009-05-14 19:30:00,17367," Fidel, it was a blast..  I've flyfished before (never with much success) so I wasn't a complete rube to how things work.  It's nice when the fish co-operate though, especially the little guys.  Barbless hooks led to all fish being released unharmed (accept for the one I almost ripped out of the water on my hookset, lol)  I am sure he was a little shocked.."
341508,fishnsled,2009-05-14 19:59:00,3520,Now that's a great outting.  I haven't done much fly fishing myself but have all the gear.  I certainly do enjoy it when I think about bring the rods along.  Might have to do it again soon.  Thanks for the report.
341509,highdrifter,2009-05-14 20:04:00,2534," Dude.  I hear ya..  I put the stuff away for years..  I love to cast, kinda like a golfer with that perfect slice-free swing, but it's just too much freaking work.  Forget quality over quantity, I wanna catch fish!!  I remember my first time fishing for specks with my dad... He spent his time searching for the wee guys I hauled out in the bush behind me!!"
341511,aniceguy,2009-05-14 20:09:00,1094,  when can I get my introductory lesson lol
341677,canadian_copper,2009-05-15 02:04:00,925,beautiful fish bro
341749,b2kptbo,2009-05-15 11:01:00,1505,"Some nice colour on those fish, WTG..."
341770,Joey,2009-05-15 12:07:00,9122,Great fish.  Looks like you did quite well for your first time.  I haven't fly fished in about 20 years. Now I miss it again after seeing your post.  Joey
341940,MJL,2009-05-15 22:19:00,2427,Beauty catches Bill  What fly combo are you running for those fish?  I've always wanted to try fly fishing for those resident fish but never really got around to doing it.  I have a 3-5wt fly reel which I've owned for about 6-7yrs but I haven't gotten around to buying a rod or line for it
341943,irishfield,2009-05-15 22:25:00,26272, Well you know where the fly rod is kept Joey.. use it when you come up!  Great stuff Bill !!!!!
341972,BillM,2009-05-15 23:39:00,17367," It's just a Temple Forks 2pc 4wt 8' combo I picked up at BPS.  I think the entire thing with a bunch of flies was around $150 or so.  The reel isn't very important, all it does is hold line   Came ready to go with line, leader, etc...  Nice little setup if you ask me, perfect for these little guys.  I don't know what type of tippet Dave put on for me, but I would guess it was 2-3lb flouro."
341979,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-15 23:52:00,3761,"wow, what beautiful little fish. I'll have to learn how to catch those beauty's one day!  Congrats on the fine catches,  MTBF"
342612,Leecher,2009-05-18 16:29:00,7832,You certainly did pretty good considering that it was your first crack at it Great job Bill and beauty trouts Thanks for sharing Leechman
342618,solopaddler,2009-05-18 16:49:00,8605,"Well done boys, nice to see."
342691,Joeytier,2009-05-18 21:46:00,3990,Those rainbows are pigs!  Nice going.
342808,Spiel,2009-05-19 10:27:00,9065,"That sucks Bill, next time take me with you."
