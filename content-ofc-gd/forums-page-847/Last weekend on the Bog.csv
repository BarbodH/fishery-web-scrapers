341909,ScugogBoy,2009-05-15 20:29:00,36,"Last weekend was a ""hot"" bite......I'm on the far east shore below the River...the eyes were chasing the minnows like crazy onto the gravel beds and shallows just after dark. Off my dock I landed and released 15 eyes in one night- all in the 2- 2 1/2lb range (kept 2 for the pan). The hot lure was a jointed rapala in silver/red...3""..... Unfortunately I hooked/landed a 44"" musky that night also.....I had a hard time reviving as it was a catastrophe trying to unhook and release it...... Don't know if it made it, but can only hope..... Fishing should be good this weekend also as the shiners are still pressing into the shallow water..."
