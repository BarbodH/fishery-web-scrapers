341924,chris.brock,2009-05-15 21:34:00,4053,We're thinking about heading up to Haliburton tomorrow morning.  Just wonderin how the blackflies are?
341927,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-15 21:38:00,270,who cares!
341929,chris.brock,2009-05-15 21:43:00,4053,My Wife!
341930,big guy,2009-05-15 21:44:00,414,"  What kind of response is that?  Obviously he does, or he wouldn't be asking."
341933,cram,2009-05-15 21:59:00,1733,you can check weathernetwork.com.....just type in minden.
341935,12footspringbok,2009-05-15 22:05:00,459,"They were starting to get thick in this afternoon in parry sound, when the wind wasn't blowing."
341936,glen,2009-05-15 22:11:00,2641,The black flies are out but they did not bite today.
341937,irishfield,2009-05-15 22:13:00,26272,What do you consider North??  Eaten alive splitting wood today.
341941,glen,2009-05-15 22:21:00,2641,Guess i was lucky then.
341942,irishfield,2009-05-15 22:24:00,26272,Really fun when they fly in your nose and come out your mouth !
341944,Radnine,2009-05-15 22:25:00,1538," It is the response of someone who is envious of someone that is heading up north (as in, ""if you are concerned about black flies stay home with the rest of us""). Jim"
341954,chris.brock,2009-05-15 22:39:00,4053,"Thanks for the replies, we're going to Haliburton, my wife isn't too happy with the black flies going in her nose and coming out her mouth"
341973,aplumma,2009-05-15 23:39:00,6896, I guess thats one way to see if your nose is clear. Personally I would rather use my finger....   Art
342124,Bob,2009-05-16 14:05:00,370,"Just getting started here in the last few days.  Looking towards some hard frost in the next few nights, maybe it'll back them off for a few days (fingers crossed).  My weekend starts tomorrow."
342214,anders,2009-05-16 20:38:00,1168,I havent seen them yet here in Wawa...seeing alot of white stuff flying around though.
342217,Mattitude,2009-05-16 21:04:00,155,They were bad up in Algonquin Park on Wednesday.  We were trying to get pictures of moose and soon after rolling the windows down we got swarmed.
342224,siwash,2009-05-16 21:43:00,683,Latest forecast is calling for snow flurries tonight! Tomorrow won't be much better..  Don't worry about black flies - an ice auger might be more useful  Why does the weather always suck on victoria day weekend? it's really very strange cause I got caught in snow on several occasions over the years...  We really have the strangest weather...it was 28'C two weeks ago in Muskoka!
