341934,siwash,2009-05-15 22:05:00,683,"Hey folks,  What are your favourite brook trout spoons? I like the Gold William Wabler (i think it's 2.5""). I also like the EPG's(sp?) - it's a black, gold and spotted spoon but not easy to find nor cheap!  I'm interested to know what else you folks use to troll and/or cast to brookies? Has anyone tried trolling a spinner while canoeing or does this lead to a lot of line spin?"
341957,chris.brock,2009-05-15 22:41:00,4053,small size little cleo in burgundy/ bronze
342000,BillM,2009-05-16 00:34:00,17367,EGB's.
342054,wallacio,2009-05-16 05:44:00,475,"Yep, EGB's and smallest Little Cleos.  I like the Cleos with the hammered finish...1/2 Silver and 1/2 Green or Blue."
342118,siwash,2009-05-16 13:46:00,683,What size Cleo's you guys use? 1/4 oz or smaller?
342122,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-05-16 13:53:00,0,"the doctor spoon...  silver on the outside, 24k gold on the inside."
342215,anders,2009-05-16 20:41:00,1168,"Buckshots...orange colour...awsome...  .and yes, trolling spinners works wonders...just use an inline swivel 2-3 feet up from your lure to help reduce line twist."
342240,siwash,2009-05-17 00:06:00,683, Thanks... what size spinners do u use?

342351,solopaddler,2009-05-17 13:37:00,8605,"#1 and #2 EGB's in various colours. Phoebe's in copper, gold and metallic perch."
342354,moosemeat,2009-05-17 13:48:00,12,"lucky strike halfwave in gold, 2 inch  deadly!! canadian tire used to sell for 2 bucks but no more, only in the soo at the trading post but over 5 bucks!!"
342494,douG,2009-05-18 00:55:00,2693,"Never mind about phoebes, nothing nothing nothing, nothing to see here,  just move along.  They never catch nothing, double negatives included."
342514,danc,2009-05-18 02:13:00,4677,My favorite Brook Trout spoon isn't even a spoon. It's a Rap countdown or a jig(fly).
342515,ctdd2006,2009-05-18 02:14:00,531,EGB's Cleos and a little dartee!  Have had a lot of success with the dartee.
342541,Musky or Specks,2009-05-18 05:49:00,2710,My favourite are EGB # 1 and# 2 in the trout parr finish. But I also like trolling Panther Martins tipped with dewage(see my upcoming long weekend report). Also cant beleive theres no love for ole Len Thompson he still gets a wash every now and then from me in both the five of diamonds and frog patterns.
