342440,Terry,2009-05-17 18:52:00,14456,"I was wondering if anyone knows anything about these the first one seems to be some kind of self winding reel..made in Japan  the second seems to be a saltwater reel, it doesn't have a thinging that goes back and forth to keep the line even but has a plastic knob on the handle, so can't be too old          "
342441,irishfield,2009-05-17 18:58:00,26272,"Second one just looks like a Penn open reel. No ""level wind"". Many mfg's make this style of reel.  First one...I think it's a hand lining reel. Use them for hand lining Pickeral when drifting the river."
342444,Terry,2009-05-17 19:04:00,14456,thanks the first one has the thingys to put it on a rod...like the high tech terms the second one has TacaBon NO.150 on it

342447,Greencoachdog,2009-05-17 19:14:00,8163,"Yeah, the first one is a fly reel and the second is trolling type reel."
342448,Terry,2009-05-17 19:21:00,14456,"thanks, so I guess I need to take up fly fishing  the trolling one will work good for a  muskie for lures in the prop wash a real loud clicker on it"
342449,dave524,2009-05-17 19:24:00,4508,"The first one is an automatic fly reel. Oldtimers may remember the Canadian AL&W tackle company. Seems that reel was made offshore and imported by them, seeing it is stamped made in Japan.  Some may find this link interesting:  http://ontariolures.com/lurecompanies/allcocklaight.html"
342461,Terry,2009-05-17 21:50:00,14456,some interesting info there
342466,dave524,2009-05-17 22:25:00,4508,"Backtracked a bit on the previous link I posted, tons of pics of old Canadian/Ontario lures here, a few remember from my dad's tackle box  http://www.picturetrail.com/muskokasun"
