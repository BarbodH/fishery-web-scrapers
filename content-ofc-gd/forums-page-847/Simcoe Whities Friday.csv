Yesterday's strong wind must have moved the fish around as we couldn't find any number of them all day. One here, one there and that was it...had to really work hard...I sure was expected much better fishing day today,....anyhow...we got 4 of them but did it take us a while to find them. Tons of boats out there, probably few hundred people...have only seen about 10-15 fish been caught and we were all over the lake....Williams half/half saved the skunk for us today. Fished 65 to 85 fow.    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
