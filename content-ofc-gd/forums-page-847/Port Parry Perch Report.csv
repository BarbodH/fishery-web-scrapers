We fished the causeway at Lake Scugog and had some decent success, no giant fish but some nice little perch to get our seasons started off. Luca and I were using a variety of baits but what seemed to work best were worms under a float and small 2"" minnows on small hooks with split shot. We fished these setups mainly off to the sides of the current. Wasn't long before Luca caught the first 3 perch then i caught 3 with our biggest being a wee little 7"" perch. Not to bad i guess but hey there's pleanty of more opportunities to get out fishing. fish #1  fish #2  fish#3  fish#4 (the big one  )  fish#5   And last fish#6    After fishing the causeway we made our way to the main dock in town where i met another OFC'r, fish-miester. We fished and had a chat there for a little bit then a Conservation Officer showed up, asked for licenses and off he went. Was good to see a CO out patrolling the area.  Before i went home I took a picture of some geese that were not impressed to see me and i did that neat shot with my rod again:    All said, we had a great day out fishing and we can't wait to get out and do it again!
