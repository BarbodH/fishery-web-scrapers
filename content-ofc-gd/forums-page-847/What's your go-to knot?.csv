342564,Yellow14,2009-05-18 13:16:00,29,Well there are probably about as many different knots as there are fish in the sea but it seems like most people have a favourite knot that they use more than any other. I used to use the improved clinch all the time but after losing a couple of my heavier lures I switched to a palomar knot and use that even when I should probably be using something else.
342568,Fish Farmer,2009-05-18 13:34:00,2234,"Palomar knot Pretty much covers things, easy to tie in the dark and when your half blind The other most knot is Snell when tying my hooks."
342574,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-18 13:48:00,3761,"All I use is the Palomar knot, also been using the double uni to connect two lines but my ""go to knot"" would be the Palomar!"

342597,kickingfrog,2009-05-18 15:41:00,8333,"Used to be improved clinch (not for braid though). Now I use the palomar knot most of the time. I can't remember the name of the knot I use for braid, it is recommended by the manufacturer."

342638,Leecher,2009-05-18 18:12:00,7832,I used to tie the Trilene all the time and could not complain about it until I switched to the UNI.... that knot is one of the toughest and have confidence in!!! Leechman
342639,setomonkey,2009-05-18 18:13:00,872,Used to rely on the Trilene knot but switched to the Palomar after finding out how easy it is to tie under low light conditions. Uni-to-uni for connecting my mono to braid...  Mike

342723,Governator,2009-05-18 23:30:00,879,I use to just tie the improved clinch knot as that's what my dad taught me as a kid.  Skip ahead 15 years when I started fishing again and while browsing online I fell in love with the Palomar knot.  It's the strongest I've used and by far the fastest to tie even blindfolded.  I've been using braided line now and use the double uni for braid to flourocarbon or tying to mono backing.
342725,Whitespinnerbait,2009-05-18 23:35:00,2038,Uniknot.....
342727,Dnthmn,2009-05-18 23:36:00,128,Line to hook - Palomar or open loop/rapala knots Line to line - Triple surgeons (Significant difference in diameter) Line to line - Albright special (Similar diameters) Fly line to leader - Nail Knot  Snell and surgeons end loop when tying harnesses etc.  That about sums it up for me.
