342061,Cudz,2009-05-16 11:26:00,2652,There was a plane rash the other day near lake St. John and the pilot sustained some injuries.  I know Wayne flies around there quite often and he was going up north and he did have a new contraption on the plane and it was windy. I doubt it was him and certainly hope it was not.  I imagine he would know who it was though. Any comment?
342065,Greencoachdog,2009-05-16 11:52:00,8163,"What goes up... must come down!  If the pilot was only injured instead of being killed, he can consider himself dang lucky!!!"
342086,irishfield,2009-05-16 12:33:00,26272,"Sorry Cudz.. you guys can't get rid of me that easy! I'm not dumb enough to untie an airplane in 75KPH winds... let alone try to land one on the water in it.  55 maybe....  When's Nipigon this year DanC ???  Also Cudz... I guess you don't have much faith in my flying skills... or the engineering that went into my ""contraption"". You're starting to sound like my mother-in-law...."
342194,Cudz,2009-05-16 19:06:00,2652,"I do have faith.  I assumed it was not you.  Just making sure.  I don't doubt your flying skills and your contraption looks awesome.  Sometimes we do dumb things.  I remember once you tried landing on ice with your wheels when you should have used your skis or vise versa, and you almost hit the shore.  No biggie.  Pretty sure I jumped a 21' foot chaparrel 40' over a bunch of rocks at 40+ mph at midnight with 7 people in the boat.  As long as we learn lessons from our mistakes. I don't mean to sound like your mother-in-law. My apologies.  Just didn't want it to be you that was in that plane crash."
342201,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-16 19:38:00,0,if he walked or swam away. It was a good landing in my books. Who cares about the plane or mother inlaws for that matter..
342230,irishfield,2009-05-16 22:23:00,26272," LOL Andy.. mine's not allowed in my house!  No harm Cudz... just funnin ya, while I kill some time around here. Hope to be out of everyones's hair by Monday am."
342304,douG,2009-05-17 04:49:00,2693,A good landing is one that you walk away from.  A great landing is one where you get to use the airplane all over again.
