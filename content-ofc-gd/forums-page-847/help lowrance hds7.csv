342571,eye-tracker,2009-05-18 13:39:00,89,If you can post a picture of the screen it will help us trouble shoot a little better. If you are getting vertical lines it is interference of some sort. Also is the transducer new or from an older lowrance unit?  I have added some screen shots with settings from right out of the box. All I did was select the fishing preset mode of Shallow Water as most water I fish is less that 50 feet.  Here is a HDS screen image I took in shallow water yesterday. I am using the auto mode with the shallow water preset. And it seems to work great with no tweaking.   Here is a screen shot from a recording where I was jigging walleye along the base of a hump. The reason the depth shows no number is it is blank during the recording playback. Once again I am using the shallow water preset and all auto modes for the best results. I find with the HDS units the presets along with the fishing modes work the best with only a few manual over rides or adjustments.    -sheldon
