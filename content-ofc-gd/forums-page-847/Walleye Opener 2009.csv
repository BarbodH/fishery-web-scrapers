We launched after 3 and fished till 8.  We went straight to a large current area where the lake bottlenecks down.  Spawning walleye + current = good fishing.  We ended up boating around 35 walleye and topped out with two fish at 26.75""  My buddy Colin with some nice walleyes.      another angle    There's opener 09 in the books"
342371,solopaddler,2009-05-17 14:45:00,8605,Awesome Ben! What were the water temps? Amazingly at my place in QC this weekend they were 53-55 degrees..
342373,trapshooter,2009-05-17 14:47:00,1234,low 40's.  There's pockets of warmer surface water but it was pretty cold in the current.
342375,limeyangler,2009-05-17 14:52:00,5204,Great stuff Ben! I should have got my self up there for opener....lol.....Lac seul is different class!
342381,irishfield,2009-05-17 15:09:00,26272,At least ya didn't have to chip your way to the channel....  ..off to another great season in paradise Ben !
342386,Terry,2009-05-17 15:35:00,14456,wow you got them dialed in nice going
342428,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-17 18:15:00,0,ice went away did it????.....  Nice deal.
342438,Spiel,2009-05-17 18:31:00,9065,"I may have said this before but, ""you suck!""   *color me green*"
342470,Joeytier,2009-05-17 22:31:00,3990,"I spent the opener on a lake behind Temagami, and got completely spanked.  Thanks for making me feel worse."
342475,Kenny G,2009-05-17 23:20:00,118,That is a great day you had. Nice eyes. Kenny G.
342479,MJL,2009-05-17 23:43:00,2427,"Awesome job on the eyes Ben  Beauty fish all around.  Is it true if you hold walleye on their belly (like the hold in the first and last pics), it makes them go limp...Or at least immobile?"
342482,rhare,2009-05-17 23:46:00,387,"Some beauty eyes Ben, good start to the season   Ryan"
342491,Whitespinnerbait,2009-05-18 00:29:00,2038,Beautiful eyes right there .......  :worthy:  Wish I knew a good Walleye Lake around here...
342517,trapshooter,2009-05-18 02:18:00,1234," It works like a charm with smaller fish.  Personally, I've never tried it with big walleye but Colin has a lot of pics like that.  They must think they're sitting belly to bottom or something."
342553,b2kptbo,2009-05-18 11:29:00,1505,"Holy-moly there's some nice eyes up there, well done..."
342556,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-05-18 11:42:00,1362,NIce eyes Ben....great way to start the season off!
342636,Leecher,2009-05-18 18:03:00,7832,Great report and pics Ben Looks like a little chilly out there     but for the quality of fish you guys caught.... reward is sweet Awesome job and beauty eyes!!! Great start to the season... just doesn't get any better than that. Thanks for sharing Jacques
342695,Bob Devine,2009-05-18 21:53:00,251,I was thinking you might still have ice. Glad to see you have open water and walleyes!
