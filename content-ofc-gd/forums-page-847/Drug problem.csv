341792,John Bacon,2009-05-15 13:16:00,3277," According to the studies I have read, teenage pregnancy declined from the 50's to the 90's.  I believe it has risen slightly since then, but is still not as high as it was in the 50's."
342207,express168,2009-05-16 20:03:00,327," You said it there, too many parents trying to be their kids ""friend"" not their ""parent"". Children need direction and shown the way back when they venture off the right path, I took my share growing up and I deserved every one. But what I believe made me who I am today was the time spent with parents, my father died when I was only 4 so my mother an immigrant who didn't speak the best english was left to raise 5 kids on her own the oldest being 17. You better believe we knew what would come our way from mom if we stepped out of line, but what happened was our Uncles and older cousins stepped up as male role models for us and took us fishing and camping, and helped teach us lifes lessons ( and we all knew they had moms permission to discipline us as needed). Unfortunately parents today are working longer and different shifts making it hard for family life, not like back in the day when you worked 9-5 M-F and stores  were closed on Sundays so the family went to the beach or fishing for the day. My wife and I have made serious changes in our jobs to be home more with our kids right now, it has cost us financially but I believe the reward will be worth the price.  Parents need to take the time and do things with their kids, not just leave them to the play stations and computers. Get involved with them, and get them involved whether it be fishing, sports, hiking whatever. Keep them busy and there is less time for trouble, all kids are going to get in trouble from time to time it is part of growing up hopefully we can keep them out of serious trouble. They have to understand that there will be consequences for all actions not just some time out in the corner. Each of my 2 children have both recieved an appropriate spank when justified and understand that the punishment will be used if necessary, luckily it has not been needed that often but they are still pretty young. Great Thread."

He Asked Me A Rhetorical Question,  'why Didn't We Have A Drug Problem When You And I Were Growing Up?'  I Replied That I Did Have A Drug Problem When I Was Young:  I Was Drug To Church On Sunday Morning.  I Was Drug To Church For Weddings And Funerals.  I Was Drug To Family Reunions And Community Socials No Matter The Weather.  I Was Drug By My Ears When I Was Disrespectful To Adults.  I Was Drug To The Woodshed When I Disobeyed My Parents, Told A Lie, Brought Home A Bad Report Card, Did Not Speak With Respect, Spoke Ill Of The Teacher Or The Preacher, Or If I Didn't Put Forth My Best Effort In Everything That Was Asked Of Me.  I Was Drug To The Kitchen Sink To Have My Mouth Washed Out With Soap If I Uttered A Profanity.  I Was Drug Out To Pull Weeds In Mom's Garden And Flower Beds And C Ockleburrs Out Of Dad's Fields.  I Was Drug To The Homes Of Family, Friends, And Neighbors To Help Some Poor Soul Who Had No One To Mow The Yard, Repair The Clothesline, Or Chop Some Firewood.and If My Mother Had Ever Known That I Took A Single Dime As A Tip For This Kindness, She Would Have Drug Me Back To The Woodshed.  Those Drugs Are Still In My Veins, And They Affect My Behavior In Everything I Do, Say, And Think.  They Are Stronger Than Cocaine, Crack, Or Heroin; And If Today's Children Had This Kind Of Drug Problem , America Would Be A Better Place To Live.   God Bless The Parents Who Drugged Us"

Kids get away with murder (sometimes literaly) and know they can because nobody can even say ""bad"" to them.  I took the strap, spoon, yard stick, belt, grandpa's boot, you name it.  I have a lot of respect for that.  If I got it, I deseved it and have no hard feeling towards anyone about getting it."

Things were not all so innocent back in the day.  Teenage pregnancies were more common in the 50's than they are now.  Drug problems were there, especially if you count alcohol.  The mafia was quite active back then..."
341525,bigugli,2009-05-14 21:01:00,6138," Don't know where you've been hiding, but  teen pregnancy has, again, been on the rise for some time. It just does not have the same stigma attached to it any more. No more 'statutory rape' charges, no more shotgun weddings, no more forced adoptions, No more insinuations of 'dirt' or 'trash' on the girl."

I was in deep deep doo doo.  And I do recall my brother and mom having an arguement and she hit him and he HIT her back. Don't know what happened when dad got home. But I was scared poopless for him and I know he NEVER did hit my mom again...EVER.  It seems that much of my generation....I'm 45.... has dropped the ball in parenting skills. Seems too many of us wanna be our kids friends instead of there parents.  I heard an expression years ago...""There is no such thing as bad kids...just bad parents. I pretty much agree with that statement."
341588,Big Cliff,2009-05-14 23:20:00,6899,"Now, this is one of the best threads I've read in a while! LOVE IT! I was very strict when bringing up my kids, they were taught to be polite and respectful. The rules were simple; first time you did something wrong, you had it explained  so that you understood why it was wrong, second time we had a very good talk to insure there was no misunderstanding and what would happen if there was a third time. After one or two tests to see if I meant it, there was seldom a third time!  When my daughter was about 6, she got angry one evening, went into her bedroom and slammed the door. I took the door off the hinges and she didn't get the door back untile she understood it was my door, I was just letting her use it and slamming it wasn't considered a good use of it. She never did slam her door again LOL.  When my son was about 25 we had a conversation one evening and one of his comments was ""I didn't always like some of your rules but one thing I have to say is, you were always fair""! I am very proud of both my son and my daughter!  I think that the biggest problem with youth today is that there is no accountability. They do whatever they want when ever they want, teachers can't discipline them, parents can discipline them (just try giving little Johnny a spanking, you'll be in jail for years).  A friends 15 year old daughter stole their car keys off the kitchen counter and took their car for a joy ride, they got charged for leaving the keys where the daughter could get them. If I had tried something like that when I was a kid; I'd have had to eat supper standing up for at least a week and that would have been for even thinking about taking the keys."
