341918,jjcanoe,2009-05-15 21:16:00,744,Just wondering if anyone knows where to find the results of the derby.  I'm sure they contact you if you won something but would like to see a results page for the draws. Thanks jjcanoe
342430,Spiel,2009-05-17 18:18:00,9065,"Well I don't know where to find the derby results on-line I do know that a retired co-worker/friend was the lucky winner of the Lund boat/motor/trailer package. As well, another retired co-worker/friend who was with him scored $500.00 with a tagged perch.  Me I never win anything."

The guy was so excited when he got the call, he didn't believe the the caller and hung up, the caller called back and said something must of happened to the connection. The guy has never owned a boat, couldn't have happened to a better guy.  The guy is in the middle in the picture  This is the Boat he won. I had the pleasure of standing beside of his new machine  I know Terry could fix this picture up, would of been nice to have him beside it."
