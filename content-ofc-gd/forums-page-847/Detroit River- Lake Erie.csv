341879,Bob Devine,2009-05-15 18:27:00,251,"The Detroit River continues to give up good catches of walleyes. The big run has slowed and now the other species(smallmout sheephead, silver bass and white perch) have kept anglers busy. Most have been jigging using 1/2-3/4 oz jigs in various colours tipping with a plastic worm or minnow. Walleye fishing on Lake Erie(Colchester-Leamington) is starting to heat up with crawler harnesses the bait of choice for many. Water temps are 56-59 degrees and some great fishing is ahead of us. "

341971,Krisco,2009-05-15 23:38:00,67,"Bob we went out of Colchester on Tuesday and did very well once we located fish. We had to be in tight 12 - 15 ft of water once we moved out past 20 ft we could not locate them. Visibility was low due to heavy winds on prior days. Most fish taken half way over towards Holiday Beach. Water temp was 54 degs. Waiting for the winds to lighten back up to get back out.  We found no colors that were out producing others, pretty consistent across the board, lots of large class fish brought to the boat 26 - 29"" that were released. Nice at this time of year not to be picking up all those shephead! We did pick up 3 or 4 smallies that sure make a mess when your running tight board paths."
