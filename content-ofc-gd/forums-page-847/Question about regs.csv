Obviously I am not going to fish and when ever I take him I end up taking off the fish for him and spend the majority of my time untangling his line anyways so I am not too worried about that anyways. I just need to know if it's legal for him to fish on his own but with me there.  Thanks."

Under 18 fishes without a license with the same rights and responsibilities as an over 18 license holder.  If he gets a big one, you can't reel it in for him.  License or not"
