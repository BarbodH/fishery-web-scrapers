Brought it in to show the better half and the reply was simply Mmmmmm Yuuuuummmmmyyyyy.  We only had walleye once last year and she remembers back to that amazing taste these fish have.  Nice, chunky 21"" fish - can't wait until dinner tomorrow night.  Maybe some surf and turf Kawarthas sytle!  "

341897,hookerdown,2009-05-15 19:12:00,110,"mmmmmmmmmm look at those fat cheeks... Ok that's it i'm staving... hopefully I can get a couple of walleye tomorrow for Sunday dinner..  Haven't had much luck catchin them the last few years.  Im about 0 for 5 or 6 trips   We got last weekend a total of 5 fish in all, with my bro (bassasin) getting a nice walleye about 2.5 to 3 lb, all fish were caught my homemade bucktail jigs.  A nice walley would suit me fine on the end of my rod.  At worse I will bring home a couple of eater pike.   MMMM pike and walleye (and some Simcoe perch from the winter) wrapped in bacon....  did I mention mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm."
