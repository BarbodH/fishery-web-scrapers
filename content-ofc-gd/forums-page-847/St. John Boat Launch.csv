341425,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-14 15:45:00,947,Hey just wondering if the Boat launch on the south end of the lake is any good for a bass Boat.  If not Where is the best and cheapest  place to launch
341427,Gerritt,2009-05-14 15:47:00,6129,I have seen thousands of bass boats launched there... it is your tow vehicle that I would be asking about.. dont attempt it in a VW jetta!  G
341429,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-14 15:48:00,947,LOl ok
341513,kickingfrog,2009-05-14 20:13:00,8333,Going by your avatar you have a least 4 outboards too many.... VW Jetta or not.
342186,Fish4Eyes,2009-05-16 18:00:00,1022, I used to tow my boat in a vw jetta...lol
342196,Cudz,2009-05-16 19:08:00,2652,the launch is free.  It is not great but does work.
342234,Kerry,2009-05-16 23:28:00,383,If the water levels are still high there you won't get your boat trailer in the little sippy hole but otherwise you should be ok and usually someone tosses a couple of skids along one side to make it a little easier to get in your boat from shore.Just beware of a couple of rocks that will be harder to see right at shore especially if the wind is blowing in.
