342402,Seaweed,2009-05-17 16:48:00,135,I hit the Miss with the Missus on Friday  What a great day....  Here are some shots of the action  Crappie Time     Didn't keep any...  but probably should have.  We bagged a couple of other Green crappie... only two and they were released.  Had a nice pike follow but...  Tried a long walleye troll....nada
