I hit a couple of shore spots in Toronto searching for pike.  I caught probably 8-9 fish most of which were small hammer handle pike that I didn't take pictures of, also an OOS bass which I unhooked in the water (why are you biting 8inch long baits!   ) I Only took pictures of a couple of the bigger fish. I Didn't catch any really big fish, but had a great time, I love early season Pike! Here they are. I think I've finally mastered the timer of my new digital cam  This was my first fish of 09'!   It had a big wound on it side... I don't know if it was from spawning? or a bigger pike? a lamprey maybe?   Another little guy  Another little guy   This was the biggest one    -Ben  P.S. Why am I not seeing a report that makes me jealous from SNAG!!!!!!   *No fish were harmed during the making of this report."
338994,xeon,2009-05-07 04:54:00,350,"That last ones pretty nice, did you get any measurements on it? 32-36''?  And I recognize that exact area, so since the pike are hitting Ill have to go down there with a bunch of friends."
339025,b2kptbo,2009-05-07 12:08:00,1505,Nothing wrong with them and some good action...
339028,alphaalpha,2009-05-07 12:15:00,475,nice fish! that is one nasty wound on that poor fish though.
339029,bassman,2009-05-07 12:18:00,384,"Nice catch, it's pretty early for that algae bloom"
339033,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-07 12:44:00,3761,"Great job, I can't wait to get out and try for some pike again.  Thanks for sharing"

339097,Leecher,2009-05-07 17:50:00,7832,Great report and pics Ben  Nice bunch of gators!!!  Good job Thanks for sharing Leechman
339124,MuskyKid,2009-05-07 21:12:00,1,I love the toxic cloud of anonymity that follows you on every fishing outing. Don't worry I know where you are and good work on otherwise a slow opener for big girls.
339232,MJL,2009-05-08 02:09:00,2427," It's not an algae bloom, it's the toxic gas produced by this fish farting   Great report and pics Ben  Thanks for sharing"
339259,Ben_Daniels,2009-05-08 03:22:00,435," Nah I didn't get a measurement or weight on any of them. Its was probably 30-32"". Ill measure the bigguns.   Yea I hate taking the time to blurr images...a real pain! But a couple years ago I got some choice words in a PM from someone.   lol   Thanks for all the replies guys  -Ben"
342050,snag,2009-05-16 04:17:00,1932,"  Because I suck.   Great to see your report Ben.  I recall you hitting the islands with success at opener every year.   p.s. Truth be told, the green haze may be gastro-intestinal.  Just sayin'............."
342203,mepps,2009-05-16 19:44:00,1301,nicely done gents!
342222,Greencoachdog,2009-05-16 21:29:00,8163,"Good report and pics Ben!!!  My PB Pike is only 27"", so you've got me beat!  Good job on the self timer pics!  ... some folks can't master the self timer and probably don't even know their camera has one.  Excellent job on keeping those fish clean for the pics, not an easy job when shore fishing!     I've been telling you that for a long time!!!... i'm glad it's finally sunk in!"
