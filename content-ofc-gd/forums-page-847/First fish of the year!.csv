As I was inspired by John F's report about Dunneville fishing, and looking not to spend a whack of cash, Will and I hit Port Maitland and headed up the Grand. We set out to jig for walleye but 10 minutes in, this throwback to the stone ages hits. I was using my new med-lite/fast Walleye rig so it was more of a coaxing from the bottom than a fight. When I finally did get him to come to the surface I could not lift the net with one hand. I did not get a picture with me and it as I am basically scared to death of these things (I told Will they were poisonous so he wouldn't think me a wimp for not touching it, good one eh?) I also didn't get the tape on him 'cause I am super paranoid about not handling fish I'm not going to keep (where'd that come from?  ) At any rate, got the hook out toot sweet and dumped him back in, none the worse for wear (near as I could tell). Thanks John, for the inspiration. And sorry to Bernie and the rest of team 8, I haven't made my sign up yet (I never usually catch anything in the Grand, honest) Jim "
