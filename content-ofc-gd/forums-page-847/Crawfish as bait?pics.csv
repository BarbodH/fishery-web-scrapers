Clear a spot out in the garage,invite some friends and family and enjoy! "
342412,Greencoachdog,2009-05-17 17:12:00,8163,The only thing wrong with that is... it doesn't look like enough!!!
342414,kickingfrog,2009-05-17 17:18:00,8333,Tasty! I guess my invite got lost in the mail.
342421,Spiel,2009-05-17 17:33:00,9065,I used to like you.
342422,Roy,2009-05-17 17:38:00,13728,Very nice Joe! Even the place mats would keep a dood busy for a while. Ecrevisse and steamed veggies! Excellent!
342423,Radnine,2009-05-17 17:43:00,1538,I love what you've done in the kitchen. Jim
342431,irishfield,2009-05-17 18:21:00,26272,"Dang Joe.... you'd think you'd invited over OFC'rs, making them eat in the garage and all ! (or is that where Becky has you living these days?? )"

342439,duckdog,2009-05-17 18:35:00,162,"They look just awesome, getting hungry now :-)"
342445,Joey,2009-05-17 19:05:00,9122,"Well don't they look tasty, yum yum.  We have a place up here called Alice Fazooli's that has them on the menu, we got them one time and they come in a big bucket.  They were delish!!!  Joey"
342451,Terry,2009-05-17 19:35:00,14456,sure looks good
342469,Daplumma,2009-05-17 22:30:00,1961,"Boiled Crawfish is one of the finer things in life.The garage is the correct place to eat them.I live there by choice Wayne,I let Bex visit sometimes.Chris...I only talk to you cause you have my dog.Any Canadian that shows up here will get a crawfish dinner,some good shine and a bed for the night.Dawg can come too but Art will need some time to get enough crawdads for an expierienced eater like him.I wont tell you how good the etouffe was with the leftovers! Joe"
342476,Rich Clemens,2009-05-17 23:22:00,3131,Well Joe - I see that one empty seat and I wasn't invited.  Heck I could have been there in just a couple hours.
342572,Beans,2009-05-18 13:41:00,3339,Gotta love the tablecloth...Are crawdads really that messy to eat ?
342585,Spiel,2009-05-18 14:50:00,9065," And I'm keeping her, that way you'll always have to talk to me. She does speak highly of you, Pops and Art."
342743,Daplumma,2009-05-19 00:26:00,1961,"As you shell them you put the carcass on the newspaper like when you eat crabs.The you roll up the ""tablecloth"" and take it to the dump.Dont let it sit in the trash can for a few days in the summer heat or you will need a new can. Rich,any time you and yer pups want to come down for some crawfish we are here. Joe"
