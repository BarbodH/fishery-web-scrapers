342490,bucketmouthjohnny,2009-05-18 00:26:00,115,"Depends on where you fish. if you like fishing shallow water, than a 54 inch might suffice. but with a 39 inch drop from the bow, i would go with a 60 inch, props don't work well out of water and in a 2-3 foot chop , your motor will be more out than in, making it tough to gain momentum.  good luck! John"
342545,Garnet,2009-05-18 09:52:00,2056,The standard is top of bow to the water plus 10 inch then if you are playing on big water add.  Garnet

342570,Handlebarz,2009-05-18 13:38:00,3790,"check out Angling outfitter I know his prices are alot better then the deals in the states I just bought the Power Drive V2 with Auto Pilot 60"" and it saved me around $200 over the price at BPS in Ohio which I pass by daily for work and do shop at alot but when the Canadian boys have close price or in this case way better I shop at home."
