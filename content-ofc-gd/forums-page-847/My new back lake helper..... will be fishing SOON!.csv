342017,irishfield,2009-05-16 01:14:00,26272,DANG Rob... I thought you tiled yourself into a wall or sumtin !!
342026,Zubris21,2009-05-16 02:06:00,563,"That sir, is a great piece of engineering.  Looks like you have everything all set.  By the way, I know of a lake up this way filled with landlocked rainbows (15+ lbs)  only access is by air... interested?"
342027,BillM,2009-05-16 02:07:00,17367,"Wayne, are you talking 9 mins from Penetang or Temagami? lol"
342033,irishfield,2009-05-16 02:47:00,26272,Temagami... and Joe knows what I mean about seeing the whole way...  
342034,irishfield,2009-05-16 02:52:00,26272,Always.. there are only 6 Rainbow lakes that I know about in the area.. and only 3 are long enough to get a GOOD performing airplane out of (you can get into any of them! lol)
342039,snag,2009-05-16 03:37:00,1932,I.F.  I could hold on to a wing I'd be giddy
342185,Zubris21,2009-05-16 17:54:00,563,  Well the lake I'm referring to is in Northern BC so it might be a bit of an adventure for you.  However it has very minimal fishing pressure due to its isolation.
342190,irishfield,2009-05-16 18:31:00,26272,I thought you meant Temagami.. but BC is fine too.. Send me a PM. Gotta get out to visit my Buddy on Harrison Lake sometime in the near future! Maybe we can do Rainbows and Sturgeon ...
342229,express168,2009-05-16 22:19:00,327,"That is absolutely awesome, you are one really smart guy there Wayne. You are a lucky man , it appears that you get to do what you enjoy doing everyday and that means you never truly work a day in your life. Good luck with the new invention."
340035,ccmtcanada,2009-05-10 18:33:00,7971,"Roy...I'll take your next model...the one with an 18 foot, deep and wide fishing boat and trailer.  If it's easier for you, it can be a little bigger than the one in the video.  Maybe the size of a shoe box.  Wayne....great work there!  Who needs MacGuyver when we have you on this board!"
340040,solopaddler,2009-05-10 18:45:00,8605," I think I'll pass.  What a great job Wayne! About the only way you could do it as well. Fly in outfitters would never strap a Sportspal to the pontoons the normal way, the aluminum is too thin and they'd crumple. That is truly ingenious.  Just got back from hauling my sportspal and a load of stuff up to the camp, everything's good to go for next week. (Beyond somebody breaking into my shed and stealing, among other things my water pump.  )  Anyhoo, we'll be hitting some back lakes starting Thursday..."
340072,TJQ,2009-05-10 21:48:00,7806,Thats pretty good Wayne!!

340106,irishfield,2009-05-10 23:27:00,26272, Theft in Quebec? You serious? lol... Really sucks Mike... same thing is a big issue in the hub of Lake Temagami as well and it's quiet arms. Luckily for us we're close to town with pretty steady traffic and now a full time year round neighbour on the Island across from us.  And thanks everyone for your thoughts.... I'll let you know how it goes. Be ready for lots of scenery pictures come October !!!
340120,tizfun,2009-05-10 23:59:00,292,All I can say is you are one very intelligent individual...  I enjoy your posts and your helpful tips you give to all board members especially mine..  Great work !!!   Tiz
340133,irishfield,2009-05-11 00:25:00,26272,"Thanks Tiz.....knowledge is something to be shared. Stuff like this may help the ""light"" come on for someone else.  Speaking of lights.. time for my next post on just how many times can you splice trailer wiring between the plug and the tongue... lol.. from todays assigned work."

340256,irishfield,2009-05-11 13:19:00,26272, 9 minutes !   ... and I can see the whole way there...
340310,brifishrgy,2009-05-11 15:53:00,559,looks great .. my only concern would be dropping one of them tubes in the drink ... hope you have a spare or you could always use some spray foam so they will float
340354,fishnsled,2009-05-11 18:43:00,3520,"Very cool Wayne.    When I use to do a lot more flying they had a saying among the pilots when transporting boats, you tie it, you fly it.  If they all had this set up it that saying would be long gone.  Nice job!"
340463,wuchikubo,2009-05-11 23:30:00,1114,"Wayne, that is seriously some ingenious bit of engineering.  I trust you remembered to account for the buoyancy of the aircraft in the water as for lining up the bar while in the water. Looks great and hoping to see the post on the maiden voyage.  Stan"

340633,Uncle Buck,2009-05-12 13:05:00,1000,"Nice job Wayne...  Question though, why didn't you face the bow towards the front of the plane? wouldn't it be more aero dynamic?"

342014,walleyemaster,2009-05-16 01:06:00,325,really cool man
339783,irishfield,2009-05-10 01:31:00,26272,Should be able to get one right up between the wheel trucks Peter! Pissy part about certified airplanes though is we'd wait 10 years for paperwork and signatures !
339784,LeXXington,2009-05-10 01:35:00,1928,WOW!! that is engineering  Guess your Lund was just too big eh
339792,brkygetr,2009-05-10 01:53:00,425,Thats freakin cool....almost as good as bacon in the morning...  ....Good lord I need a float plane license. I was lazy and didn't read all comenets but I hope you gots a small lawnmower battery and a electric for that outfit????  Either way amazing concept. If you ever feel like flying to NW ontario there's a few lakes out here that are inaccessable via non-air methods.
339795,Jigger,2009-05-10 01:55:00,1237,"Some great thinking there IrishField! Job well done! Was thinking that theres an awful lot of bending over for you there. Maybe you could rig up a pull cord to lower/hoist the canoe? Also, would it be easier to thread the rods through the canoe in ""docking"" mode. It looks as though theres a possibility of pinching your hand if you're in the canoe and you're trying to get it set and pinned? Obviously you know better, the video is a little grainy so I can't see the full operation. Just a safety thought. Otherwise I'd have to give this one a big two thumbs up!!"
339798,irishfield,2009-05-10 02:04:00,26272, I'm not that old YET jigger! lol And I'd estimate the required pull to swing that canoe up is less than 15 lbs. It's basically effortless single handed.  Nothing to pinch my hand in.. tubes go thru the boat.. all I'm doing on the inside when in the canoe is putting in a PTO style lock pin so the tubes can't fall out and to pin the boat in place in relation to the tube. Attachment to the float itself will only happen when I'm standing on the float. I was originally going to have fixed/pivoting tubes on the airplane and swing them down and attach to canoe... but realized I can tip the canoe around where I need it to hook it to airplane. I can't move the airplane to hook it to the canoe.
339803,Moosebunk,2009-05-10 02:16:00,3970,Great example of why you're an engineer and fella who likes to build stuff.  Looking forward to hearing about the first mission attempts.  Nice work Wayne.
339808,2 tone z71,2009-05-10 02:23:00,1311,"Very nice Wayne .no surprise thou coming out of your shop ,well done man, get to Temagami already would ya ,if things dont change here soon I may be up there trying to wheel @ deal with Bill hopefully on all the blown up outboards kicking around"

339826,wallyboss,2009-05-10 03:21:00,1095,"I started looking at the pictures before reading the story.  At one point I said to myslef"" Pretty big outriggers on that canoe""  Then I clued in!!!   Nice job."

339859,Terry,2009-05-10 11:04:00,14456,that is very cool  so do you have an anchor for the plane

339865,tinbanger,2009-05-10 11:16:00,1028,awesome as usual Wayne. Glad to see you got the shop emptied out  Safe travels  TB
339936,irishfield,2009-05-10 14:11:00,26272,  Yes Terry... Figure I'll throw the anchor.. get the canoe launched and then use it to tie a secondary rope to a tree on shore to make sure the plane is still around when I get back from fishing.   As for the rod holders and rods blowing out. What I wanted was the holders with the strap.. but no one in town had them. Might grab a set in Bass Pro (if they have them) on Monday when I run daughter #1 back to the big smoke.
339938,limeyangler,2009-05-10 14:17:00,5204,absolutely amazing Wayne...real good job!

339973,SlowPoke,2009-05-10 15:49:00,2984,"Nice job Wayne. When you told me you were doing an auto-loader I had envisioned the canoe being lowered from the wing. Then I had visions of two canoes, one each side. Then you'd want kayaks at the wing tips. The look wouldn't be complete without you wearing a mad bomber hat.  I'll bet there will be some wet feet and balancing issues the first couple of times but it looks like a great setup. -Brian"
339979,Roy,2009-05-10 15:59:00,13728,"Seriously well thought out, Wayne. Hope you have a great time with it this season.  ps. Not to upstage you but I too invented a little something for the womenfolks. It took me a whole weekend cause I was busy with other things.  "
340001,cisco,2009-05-10 16:54:00,597,Great invention Wayne! Once any bugs are worked out I bet the other pilots will want you to build it for em.  Great idea and I hope the field tests go well with no wet surprises!
339728,irishfield,2009-05-09 23:33:00,26272,"Last year I came to the conclusion that if I wanted to succesfully fish the back lakes I needed a boat... as drifting the airplane and casting from a float bow is just not productive.. and at times a tad dangerous. Picked up a 12' square back Sportspal last fall and did a test flight with it strapped down tight before winter came. Found things flew the same, with the canoe having little or no effect on flight characteristics.  So I thought about it all winter. Most back lakes are so grown in I can't get to shore to unload.. reload a canoe and generally end up anchored in a small bay somewhere. There is no way to load and strap down a canoe when on the water... so when there's a will, there is usually a way. Got my last customer out of here on Wednesday and spent the last three days putting together, from my head, a canoe loader/unloader. I knew pretty much what and how I wanted to do it.. with some pivot brackets and telescopic tubes.    The biggest hurdle was how to hook onto the canoe and after a trip to the ""thinking"" room, it dawned on me what to do..... and that's where the Purists might wanna stop viewing this thread and hit the back button!! lol Yep.. why not just cut holes for the tubes...    Pivot bracets taking shape.    First test flip before drilling any holes in the float decks or airplane.    Flipped back down and knowing it's going to work.. time to commit!    After a few flips and getting the pivot brackets bolted down. Time to positively locate the boat on the telescopic tubes so every flip is the same.    Reinforced the cut outs in the canoe.    Installed a pair of 6 rod holders under the seats. This way I can carry everything IN the boat that I need...ready to fish. Paddles, rods, two life jackets and safety kit in the bow. Just grab a tackle box and go fish..      All pivot and lock pins are aircraft mil spec quick pins and retainer chains so I don't drop any in the lake. These are also slick for your power ice augers lads!      Note once it's flipped up.. the rod holders are upright = rods don't fall out!    You can't miss me... if you see me wave... wave real hard if it appears I haven't seen you when landing!    Hard to simulate being on the water... but it should actually be easier to load on the water than in the hangar. Done fishing and loaded in less than 2 1/2 minutes... boat in and fishing in less than 45 seconds. The telescopic tubes can also just stay attached to the canoe.. as the rear one is not in my way and if solo the front one can stay. If a passenger, then the front tube needs to be pulled out and left with the airplane."

339735,medmart,2009-05-09 23:51:00,587,Great job Wayne but i have to wonder how many times you will be going for a swim when you step into the canoe LOL  Rob
339737,irishfield,2009-05-09 23:58:00,26272,"Haven't had it on the water yet.. so don't know how (un) stable it is. No fear... I always have a trout fishing vest on, with inflator rip cord when flying floats !!"
339741,Kenny G,2009-05-10 00:14:00,118,Really cool man! Sportspals are a good canoe to fish from. Kenny G.
339743,jediangler,2009-05-10 00:17:00,1923,"Very nice set up. My only question would be, wouldn't it create less turbulance flying with the nose of the canoe at the front instead of the transom?"
339745,bigugli,2009-05-10 00:20:00,6138,Great bit of inventiveness there.
339746,irishfield,2009-05-10 00:22:00,26272, No... it actually causes less turbulence in reverse. Same reason streamline strut has the blunt/wide end forward.. tapered trailing. The boat in this direction will actually create lift as well.. same as a wing shape. Even if none of those did anything.. the flat front is more predictable than what a tapered end will do in wind gusts... prop wash etc.. and besides that... need the tapered end at the back to clear water rudder cables! lol
339748,irishfield,2009-05-10 00:23:00,26272, THANKS....I'd patent it bigugli.. but I already have a drawer full of those useless documents !

339757,danbouck,2009-05-10 00:37:00,4380,That looks great! I'm curious how many times you are going for a swim while trying to get to the other side
339759,irishfield,2009-05-10 00:42:00,26272,"I go across there all the time Dan. Not an issue with lots to hold onto, but I always tend to bump my head and why I'm going bald. Other option is to just climb up the keel strips on the canoe and in the passenger door."

339766,Fisherman,2009-05-10 01:03:00,7201,"Okay, time for the proverbial monkey wrench   , everything is good and stable on terra firma, but I imagine that the plane bobs up and down a tiny bit and the canoe empty will ride at a certain level and when you get in, (not saying yer a lard butt) but then the canoe goes down a bit, will the square holes for the rack accomodate that much movement up and down? f it was just holes on one side probably wouldn't matter but the rack bars go right through to the other side, catch my drift."
339767,BillM,2009-05-10 01:03:00,17367,"  Don't scratch it Wayne, he cringed anytime we rubbed up against the rocks  :)"
339769,irishfield,2009-05-10 01:06:00,26272," Once I get my fat ass out of the ganoe the boat will actually sit a bit higher.. or should I say the attach tubes will be a bit higher than the pivot attach brackets on the float. Push down on the tube to tip the canoe a bit and the pins (should) pop right in.. easier than with it sitting on jack stands.   The canoe isn't that rigid either... it 's made of such light alum that it twists end to end pretty easily.  I'll find out late next week, hopefully, how it works on the water.."

339773,perodimi,2009-05-10 01:11:00,124,Do you need a co-pilot with an instrument rating by any chance?
339774,Radnine,2009-05-10 01:14:00,1538,"I had the same question Wayne and will bow to your expertise on the answer, but am still dubious. You might also want to go with back up rods to test those holders the first time (I worry about vibrations and winds sending them soaring). I am envious of the ingenuity and the ability, as well as the opportunity, to create things such as this. You are like the kid in the candy store, that can also make new candy. And your hangar looks like the ultimate man cave. Good on ya! Jim"
339775,irishfield,2009-05-10 01:16:00,26272,Instrument flying... that was last summers trip to Nipigon.....
339777,irishfield,2009-05-10 01:22:00,26272," Jim.. I had half a thought to throw a strap around the front as well...but considering the 3/8"" quick pins have about a 9 ton shear rating x 2 pins on each bar... compared to my float attachment itself that is only a single 5/16 bolt top and bottom of each strut, I think she'll be fine. Pivot plates have double failure built in and the canoe can't move once pegged. It's definitely stronger than when I flew it with CTC ratchet straps on it!  For peace of mine.. the front bow rope of the float will get tied to the canoes, plastic, handles..."
339780,perodimi,2009-05-10 01:29:00,124,Do you think anybody would notice if you rigged a canoe for me too?:
