342160,Tybo,2009-05-16 16:08:00,1373,"So I'm in the market to buy a new boat. The boat I'm buying is in the states. I don't want to drag my boat to the states for trade in. I decide to sell it private. Two days later the boat is sold. I phone the dealer to tell him I'm coming to get the boat. He informs me that he forgot to tell the salesman that the boat is sold. He takes a day off and the salesman sells my boat. He tells me that he has another but more money. big engine. So I tell him I'll buy that boat, but need some time to get the extra money together. He says no problem, I'll mark this  as sold.  The first time since I was 14 teen I don't own a boat. Now it's the long weekend and I'm boatless  .  OH for what a man is to do."
342161,rbaquial,2009-05-16 16:10:00,968,"Looks like its back to basics... SHORE FISHING!  hehe... and then, while your at that... you can admire other peoples nice boats....  At least that's what I do!"
342163,Greencoachdog,2009-05-16 16:11:00,8163,Go shore fishin' for Carp!!!  ... dunno if Joey could catch one if there isn't any ice to fish thru though!
342164,gdelongchamp,2009-05-16 16:16:00,199,"Dont be too hasty to buy that boat. It's one of the oldest scams around. The car companines use it all the time.  They advertise a particular model all over the newspaper and when you show up at the dealership it's gone but hey!!! come lood at this one it cost  a little more but Hey!! it's got a bigger motor.  You never hear ""Hey come look at this one it's the same but a little smaller motor so it will cost you a bit less."""
342170,Tybo,2009-05-16 16:33:00,1373,Shore fishing. What's that. I tried that once.
342174,Terry,2009-05-16 16:55:00,14456,could lend you my folding boat till you get one    got a small motor too
342189,irishfield,2009-05-16 18:18:00,26272,Maybe just sit around the house and rub your honey's feet Paul !!
342251,Dutch,2009-05-17 00:46:00,831,"Too bad about losing out on the boat because of a miscommunication.  Thing is, you get a bigger one now!  Congrats."
342274,HTHM,2009-05-17 02:14:00,4082," You could say, your mistake, I'll take that boat at the same price as the other one, and be prepared to walk away."
342318,Spiel,2009-05-17 10:51:00,9065,Did you remember to take out all your fishing gear.
342334,Rizzo,2009-05-17 12:48:00,4754,I'm with hometownhandyman. Worst case scenario is they say forget it. Maybe call other dealerships and they will match (or better) your original agreement.
