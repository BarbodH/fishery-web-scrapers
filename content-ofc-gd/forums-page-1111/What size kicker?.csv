141069,krawler,2007-12-09 22:48:00,167,"Bday/xmas are close together, parents are buying me a kicker motor.  my boat is a lund alaskan, dry weight is 915 lbs and it has a 75hp, 2 guys, gas and a little gear,  what size do you recommend?  only want to use it for trolling when im out for salmon /trout."
141071,Gerritt,2007-12-09 23:00:00,6129,Grab a 250 verado and use the 75 for trolling LOL
141075,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-09 23:11:00,1351,i'm thinking 5hp
141078,fishindevil,2007-12-09 23:14:00,6254,"Well get a 9.9 high thrust kicker....they are made just for that....no they are not a normal 9.9   they have low rpm...but produce big,time touque,they are made just to be for that reason,i fish salmon on lake o...and about 5 of my friends have them...and its amazing how big a boat that those high thrust motors will push....goo-luck and check them out try the mercury oneyamaha has one too...not too sure about the price but they are very reasonable,maybe even check the prices on the us side as our high dollar you might get a really good deal,as well as being at the end of the year,they will be really wanting to get rid of them....cheers hope this helps...."
141079,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-09 23:17:00,1351,"his boat isn't too big, so i don't think he needs a 9.9.. since it will be more costly to purchase and heavier. however if he is interested... i see one on ebay.. 9.9 high thrust yamaha in the states.. $2500, however shipping blah blah blah, might not be worth it. http://cgi.ebay.ca/YAMAHA-OUTBOARD-MOTOR-N...1QQcmdZViewItem"
141081,silveradosheriff,2007-12-09 23:21:00,1025,"I'm in a similar situation and it will be either the 8 or the 9.9. Not much price difference, so the 9.9 will probably win out.  :-)"
141112,krawler,2007-12-10 00:41:00,167,"ive asked the same question for my bigger boat which is 22' and the dry weight is 3500 lbs and people advised me to get a 9.9 but this boat is much smaller and lighter, so wouldnt i need a smaller motor, i was thinking 4 hp, is that not enough?"
141114,silveradosheriff,2007-12-10 00:49:00,1025,I'm guessing that a 4 would be working fairly hard to push 3 mph into the wind with some rollers added for good measure. I'll be using mine for trolling for Musky as well so I will need the extra speed. If there is someone using a 4 hp on around 1000 lb vessel - it would be great to hear their feedback....  
141141,Terry,2007-12-10 02:00:00,14456,I have a 16ft deepV with a 90hp on it with a 5 hp kicker and  at idle it pushes the boat just over 1mph and doesn't take much more gas to push it in heavy  winds
141144,Dondorfish,2007-12-10 02:13:00,1000,I have a 22 foot Islander (aluminum) with a 8 hp on it. At idle it goes around 1 mph and wide open it will push the boat at 4.8 mph.  Hope that helps  Don
141149,drifter,2007-12-10 02:31:00,12,Very good point sheirff. It can get windy trolling for trout. And it would help keep the boat from getting push around.
141151,Mike the Pike,2007-12-10 02:35:00,3421,I use a 8hp on an 18ft Lund SSV if your Alaskan is a few years old or older then it has the same hull as my SSV.8hp is the right size and I am sure you could get away with less.Your parents are great.
141160,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-10 02:46:00,1351,"for me, i'm going to stick with the 4-6hp choice, lighter and cheaper and seems to do the job ( i don't plan on going on days too windy!) plus if i do, i always have the powerdrive at the front that i could put to use  kevin"
141190,POLLIWOGG,2007-12-10 04:57:00,835,"I run a 6 hp yammy on a 23' glass at around 3500 -4000lb, at idle on flat water it will just move the boat.  That works well for jigging. trolls walleye nicely does about 7mph wot, about the same as the 7.5 merc that some long fingered f#$% helped himself to.  If we did the math 7mph is about the hull speed of a boat this size. If i go to a bigger motor the only advantage would be more control in dirty weather, no real difference in top end as Ive already reached the hull speed and I loose the ability to crawl along dead slow and would burn a little more fuel. I have only had it out on rough water once and abandoned it for the big motor right away because I had a boat load of guys and it was one less thing to screw with.  Question ... Can you get the high thrust option in  smaller than a 9.9?"
141192,icefisherman,2007-12-10 05:22:00,952," Answer: Yamaha makes 8HP high thrust 4 stroke motor. Same as mine but mine is 9.9HP  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
141197,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-10 05:55:00,1351,"  looks like the MSRP for 8hp high thrust is $3000 and $3245 for 9.9  same weight, but for extra $250, you get 2hp more."
141333,taper,2007-12-10 19:11:00,611,I have the Yamaha 8 hp high thrust and love it but I don't think you will need that big. I run an 18 foot bow rider with three of us in it you just idle to troll. You can probably save some bucks and go 5 or 6 hp.
141338,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-10 19:25:00,1351,"so.. in conclusion.......  you can get away with 5hp and save a few bucks  or  you can grab a 8 or 9.9hp high thrust, for almost double the price but they are superior but not necessary.  you're lucky your parents grabbing you this..  maybe mine will upgrade our caravan to a MDX for me?? hahaha"
