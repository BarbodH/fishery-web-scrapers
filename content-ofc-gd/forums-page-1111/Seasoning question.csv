140968,troutologist,2007-12-09 16:44:00,951,Alright Im having a major memory lapse here.  Ive gotta take some folks out ice fishing and cook a shore lunch tomorrow so im getting all the ingredients ready today. There was a spice I used this summer that I cant remember for the life of me. It was a brand name and was kind of a fish or seafood seasoning with 5 spices in it.  It works great on fish and Id like to pick it up but cant remember the name to save my life.   HELP!!!  Thanks folks

140975,troutologist,2007-12-09 16:59:00,951,No its a spice blend that comes in a those med size plastic bottles...i went to one gorcery store but didnt see it.

140980,fishinfool,2007-12-09 17:29:00,366,Is it Montreal Steak Spice or Lawrys? They both do the job right proper anyway.
140985,Greencoachdog,2007-12-09 18:03:00,8163,I love guessing games!  Was it the Colonels secret blend?... no that's 11 herbs and spices...  dammit!... I hate it when I loose!!!
