140313,Roy,2007-12-07 10:13:00,13728,"Let's hope for the best. There's never a good time to be battling fires but in this cold it must be terrible work. Winds are at 20K in Barrie right now, let's hope they calm down some."
140314,Roy,2007-12-07 10:20:00,13728,"Found this:  Fri, 2007-12-07 02:14.           John Elston              An explosion at the Royal Thai restaurant in the Bayfield and Dunlop area of downtown Barrie sparked a major fire late thursday night.     Due to concerns the fire could spread,  apartments above nearby stores were evacuated.   Evacuees were taken to a church.  No injuries have been reported,  but the fire was burning out of control for several hours.  The accompanying picture showing flames smoke billowing up from the fire scene was shown on the City of Barrie's web site between 2 and 3 a.m.  After 3 o'clock,  the flames began dying down."
140315,misfish,2007-12-07 10:27:00,29133,"First I heard of this. That is right at the five points,the heart of the downtown core.  Winds are almost nil now Roy. This is the second fire in 4 months down town.  The first one,talk on the streets was a myth lab,yet it was never confirmed. Dont want to tarnish this great city."
140316,lew,2007-12-07 10:36:00,12767,"Sounds like 4 buildings are gone Brian, including the Wellington Hotel ?? .....hopefully everyones safe.  Thanks for the update Roy"
140319,misfish,2007-12-07 11:02:00,29133,Just reported that the whole block has gone up.Right from Random Ranch to the corner (radio report ?).
140321,motv8tr,2007-12-07 11:28:00,2587,"Fire is across from Random Ranch I think and still going at this time, they have it on City TV Breakfast Television....even Honeymoon Suit and Rick Emmet had to be evacuated last night from their concert....no injuries reported yet, but will be devastating to Barrie I think.  Fire is still going   at least one building completely gone, started at around 12:30, fire crews came in from other townships to help out, they are now getting water from Lake Simcoe as the water pressure in Barrie is too low.  Yup, the Wellington Hotel is gone, it was built in 1880 I think, sad day for sure in Barrie  Maureen"
140341,motv8tr,2007-12-07 12:35:00,2587,"Just heard one fire fighter recieved a minor injury, separated shoulder, but 7 hours later the fire is still smoldering, and the snow is not helping  maureen"

140604,Rizzo,2007-12-08 02:37:00,4754,"As a newer resident of Barrie I'm not too familiar with the Wellington Hotel, but I loved Royal Thai!  Never ate in there, but it was my number 1 take-out option. Saw the damage in person today, sad sight.  Just a block or 2 away there was another big fire like Brian said a few months back"
