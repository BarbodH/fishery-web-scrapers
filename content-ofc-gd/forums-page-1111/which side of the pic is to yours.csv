140694,Hawg Hunter,2007-12-08 13:02:00,204,hello all just wondering which side of this pic you'd prefer i myself don't drink alot but id take both 
140697,Beats,2007-12-08 13:07:00,543,"Although I'm not a fan of ""diet beer"", I'd definitely go for the right hand side."
140700,Terry,2007-12-08 13:20:00,14456,well the coffee looks empty..so right side
140701,Mike the Pike,2007-12-08 13:23:00,3421,I like the one on the left in the morning and the pic on the right in the evening.
140703,Greencoachdog,2007-12-08 13:42:00,8163,"Why bother with the right one?... it's little more than water, and about the same buzz"
140794,KyleM,2007-12-09 00:53:00,218,"Pass on that in the morning? Hecknah,  Girls light IS a morning beer."
140795,addict,2007-12-09 00:56:00,475,"left,havent had a drop of booze in 4yrs."
140870,jediangler,2007-12-09 04:19:00,1923,I'm with fishtat2 (no drunkeness for 22years) but I'll take just the bottom half of the pic as I don't drink coffee either. Looks like only enough fish for one anyway
140991,joonmoon,2007-12-09 18:50:00,528,"Skip the silver bullets, make that an extra large and give me all the fish and I'm in. Add a few Pepsi and Jedi will take er."
140992,knotaclue,2007-12-09 18:59:00,136,what kind of fish is it
140997,fishindevil,2007-12-09 19:16:00,6254,"Well i would pass on the girly beer,and have that timmies all the way...as long as the fish is walleye !!!!!"
