141045,2 tone z71,2007-12-09 21:03:00,1311,could be my terrible memory but I remember reading or someone telling me that any sleds bought and brought across the border there warrenty was NIL could be wrong but worth checking out
141101,trapshooter,2007-12-10 00:32:00,1234,My buddy just bought a sled in the states.  If you don't have your paperwork in order before you come back accross then you have to wait 72 hrs for them to process it.  He called customs and found out what he needed and had everything when he came back.  He did it all in a day trip.  Once back in cadada he had the sled inspected (similar to getting a car saftied) and said this now gave him warranty in Canada.   The sled was a ski-doo so I don't know if it's the same for other manufacturers.  Definitely worth looking into with our $$ the way it is.
141184,Bernie,2007-12-10 04:22:00,3190,From what I understand there is no warranty on a Skidoo/Seadoo brought into Canada from the US----period. Bombardier would not allow us to sell to a US resident unless they have a Canadian address. We are also not allowed to ship to some country's in Europe.
141289,Rustic-Fisher,2007-12-10 16:58:00,826,Thanks for the replys.
141330,taper,2007-12-10 19:05:00,611,my understanding is that the inspection allows you to licence it here in Canada.
