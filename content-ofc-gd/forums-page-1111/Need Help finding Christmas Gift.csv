140381,motv8tr,2007-12-07 14:42:00,2587,"Hey all, this is a last ditch, last minute desparate attempt here....in this weeks CTC sale flyer there is a toy, Super Moto TV arcade game, page 6 bottom left hand corner, product number 50-4388-4  It's on for half price, and sale ends tonight   I just saw the thing yesterday and it would be pretty much perfect for a young lad I know.  The problem is that the store in Midland doesn't have any (not sure if they did) and no store in Barrie has any.  My usual back up in Parry Sound is on vacation and I'm not in Toronto this today.  Is anyone near a CTC they would be willing to check, and purchase for me and I will get to you this weekend if at all possibe???? It is 50.00 so it's not cheap.  Thanks everyone  Maureen"
140386,cranks bait,2007-12-07 14:49:00,721,"Hi Maureen,  I just called our one here and they do not have it in stock.  She was going to check the computer and see who does, but the system crashed.  Maybe try calling Midland and see if they would do a check for you to any one close?"

140404,lew,2007-12-07 15:14:00,12767,"I just called the store down here near me Mo and they don't stock that item, so she checked her puter and it says it's not stocked by ANY Canadian Tire in Ontario  I just got my new CTC flyer last night and it doesn't show anything even close to that on Page 6   They do have a heck of a deal on a set of pliers though, if yer interested"

140430,irishfield,2007-12-07 15:59:00,26272,Just like last year with CTC... everything they had in their flyer that Leah wanted for people was NEVER stocked in the store. She had a fist full of rain checks that took her 'till mid winter to get filled.  Same thing this year with their Christmas calendar coupons. Garage floor dolly... $40 off reg $49.99 for $9.99 Dec 5th to 7th only. They had 2 in the store late on the 4th.... and amazingly NONE at store opening on the 5th (cause I went there as they were unlocking the doors so I could make my Dr. appointment for 9)

Apparently they have two in stock. Too far to go?? The lady also told me that the stores will not be re-ordering the item.  Good Luck Stan
140537,motv8tr,2007-12-07 22:50:00,2587,"Thanks Stan, but ya a little too far for me to get to tonight....I found a place online that has them, but it's double the cost plus shipping  , back to the drawing board.  Maureen"

140672,Big Cliff,2007-12-08 11:43:00,6899,"I did some more checking and Sears had them (not on special) but when I went to their web site it said ""product not available at this time"". It doesn't give any idea of when it might be available. You might want to try calling Sears and see what they have to say."
