141052,Photoz,2007-12-09 21:26:00,792,"According to the Simcoe Board posts there are already a few looking to test their floater suits & cold water swimming abilities! Apparently they're on 3"" to 4"" of ice . . . . .    wait till they get a stiff offshore breeze . . . . .     !"

141189,xrap,2007-12-10 04:43:00,683,"Oh no, not yet guys. Just planning a trip ahead in about 3 weeks or so. The place I have had my mind in site is getting about on average -15 temps everyday for about the past 2 weeks, but I still would like to be sure that the lake is frozen when I egt thier. And safe since I don't wear a floater suite. Ice fishing right now is out of the question. Just in the planning stge. And Thanks for the links guys"

141287,Headhunter,2007-12-10 16:51:00,5703,"Different location, but last Thursday, I saw a guy on a quad, pulling an ice hut across Weller Bay in Trenton. Thought he was a little nuts, but he seemed to know where he was going! Didn't see a splash as he tore off, out of site! HH"
