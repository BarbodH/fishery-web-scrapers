140998,Bernie,2007-12-09 19:17:00,3190,"Was looking at the amount of hours in a day on the weather network. After tomorrow we start to gain daylight in the evenings again. We will continue to lose time on the sunrise until the first week in January.  So spring is just around the corner.   Just a little wishful thinking. Ya I know, its WAAAAAAAYYYY to early to think about it yet."
141001,fishindevil,2007-12-09 19:28:00,6254,"Yes its still along way off,but hey it will come...we just got to get this winter craqp out of the way,first   !!!and i still havnt put my boat away yet   DAM WEATHER...LOL..LOL..LOL"

141004,Bernie,2007-12-09 19:36:00,3190,The only place I like to see ice Gerritt is crushed in my Black Russians
141007,Gerritt,2007-12-09 19:41:00,6129,Mmmmmmm Russians!
141010,bucktail,2007-12-09 19:48:00,1857,"How can we gain daylight before the winter solstice? After the 21st or 22nd yes, but not till then, unless the planet tilted this year?"
141041,irishfield,2007-12-09 20:45:00,26272,The earth has tilted due to all the natural resources that they have been removing from one side of the sphere and transporting it to the other side. Kinda like an out of balance wheel.  My educated deduction on why we have such strange weather lately...it has nothing to do with Global Warming !
141051,Terry,2007-12-09 21:26:00,14456,"if you re read his post you will see that he is correct  it starts to stay light longer in the day starting now but getting light  in the mornning later, so we are still getting less hours of daylight.each day till solstice but in fact it is saying light later in the day"
141057,Photoz,2007-12-09 21:38:00,792,"December 21 the sun comes up at 07:49 and sets at 4:44 . . . .    8 hours & 55 minutes of daylight . . . .   a week later we have gained a whole 6 minutes daylight! To bad they moved the time change . . . . .     I used to love walkin' along one of the east tribs in mid April, watching the sky lighten in the east starting about 04:15! So nice & peaceful!"
141103,Bernie,2007-12-10 00:33:00,3190,"Thank you for the back up Terry.  Photoz, why would they change it just for you and Lew? You guys are the only two in Canada that get up before 5 AM!"
141128,douG,2007-12-10 01:36:00,2693,"Our guess at high noon is just an estimate, and it fluctuates with the seasons, sometimes before the clock, sometimes after.  That's why our days change length 'unevenly'.  The Savings Time thingy helps even things out a bit, but not perfectly."
141138,Greencoachdog,2007-12-10 01:53:00,8163,"Well it felt like Spring here today, it was +24 C only going down to a low of +16 C tonight.... gonna be +26 C tomorrow, and.... I know I know"
141178,Garry2Rs,2007-12-10 03:44:00,1425,"It was overcast, with light rain in Yuma today. It only reached about 19, and will dip to 5 or 6 tonight... But the fish were biting...grin.  "
