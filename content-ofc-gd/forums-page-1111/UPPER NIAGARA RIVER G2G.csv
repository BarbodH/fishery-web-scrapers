140103,Rizzo,2007-12-06 17:03:00,4754,"not sure who's coming, but looks like I'm about 80% yes."
140114,lew,2007-12-06 17:32:00,12767,"Roger, we'll try to launch at the same Marina where we always meet, about 7:30, but if it's frozen over (most likely) head up to the one at Frenchmans Creek, it's usually ice free in there.  Gimme a call on my cell when you arrive if you can't find us......647-407-7931  Bring a BIG stringer with ya, I'm feeling lucky"
140115,irishfield,2007-12-06 17:34:00,26272, Guess no calls from the hospital today Rizzo ! Have fun lads...wish I could join ya.. but it wasn't to be.
140116,lew,2007-12-06 17:38:00,12767,"We do it every December Wayne, so mark your 2008 calander for 1 year from this Saturday and we'll see you there"

140667,lew,2007-12-08 09:48:00,12767,"Good to hear Roger, see you in a couple hours."
140687,Handlebarz,2007-12-08 12:32:00,3790,Hope you guys have a safe one out there it looks like the ice has ended our season here
137190,Squid,2007-11-26 21:06:00,1656,"Ok so the date is fast approaching for the closure of muskie season. Lets meet on December the 8th, 2007 at the marina @ 7.30AM. Wash some lures for the day and then meet at the netherby road ( area) restaurant at 4.30Pm for some swilling."
137197,lew,2007-11-26 21:38:00,12767,"I'll be at your place @ 6:00 Pete, as always it'll be a great way to close out the season"
137199,Fang,2007-11-26 21:43:00,1330,Can we book a little color to the river this year.  I'll try and make it and will confirm later. Boat needs some work and starting battery is not 100%. Don't want to get caught up there without that!!!!
137209,motv8tr,2007-11-26 22:15:00,2587,  Sure the boss will give you the day off Lew???  Maureen
137213,lew,2007-11-26 22:43:00,12767,"Well, if he doesn't Mo, he'll be lookin for another driver on Monday"
137214,FinS,2007-11-26 22:44:00,463,anyone need a partner
137377,lew,2007-11-27 12:24:00,12767,Bumpity Bump
137512,Handlebarz,2007-11-27 20:36:00,3790,have fun out there guys I will be pounding it here and hope that there are some big girls left for christmas
137534,Squid,2007-11-27 22:28:00,1656,Hey Mike! we will give you a call if we land a big girl! 6 AM!! sheesh
137624,Rizzo,2007-11-28 04:25:00,4754,I'll be there assuming work/wife allow it
138331,Fishmaster,2007-11-30 22:10:00,920,Won't be able to make it will be on the Lower Niagara that day ....lets hope these big winds die off the river is a muck whole now ..
139029,Squid,2007-12-03 13:59:00,1656,Well Lew it is starting to look like its just you and I out for the day.
139114,lew,2007-12-03 18:01:00,12767,"That's fine by me Pete, neither of us likes crowded waters anyways  See ya Saturday morning bright & early"
139166,irishfield,2007-12-03 20:07:00,26272,"I gave it thought when I saw sunshine for Saturday and snow ending Friday..figured I could trailer down mine, but they changed the weather and I'm not overly keen on covering it with road salt just yet."
139199,lew,2007-12-03 21:44:00,12767, And they'll change it 9 more times before Saturday too Wayne  Just hook onto the boat and drag er down
139205,irishfield,2007-12-03 21:57:00,26272,"We'll see how the week goes Lew. How long does it take to get there from say 400/401? I'd have to leave purdy darn early and would also have to find a crew mate. Checked out the launch, where we launched when you were up to fish with me, and it's snowed in and the channel is iced in. Was hoping to get out this week on Thursday, but it don't look like it's gonna happen."
139227,lew,2007-12-03 22:37:00,12767,"Wayne, the cutoff for the boat ramp is at Netherby Road, off the QEW, about 15 minutes or so past Niagara Falls so it's a fair drive from 400 / 401....takes me about 90 minutes from my place.  The current in the river is normally strong enough to keep too much ice from forming around the boat ramp and I always carry a shovel & salt incase of snow.  It's always a great way to close out the musky season and it'd be good to see you down there.  "
139230,irishfield,2007-12-03 22:40:00,26272,Thanks Lew..will see what happens.
139280,Squid,2007-12-04 00:31:00,1656,Boy that was a cold day eh Lew?
139349,SlowPoke,2007-12-04 10:59:00,2984," Hey Wayne, I was going to go to LSC for one last blast in my boat but I'd be happy to join you if you're on the fence. I don't really feel like chipping the ice off my boat anyway. We could meet in the Stoney Creek area around 7 and still make the upper shortly after sun-up. -Brian"
139367,lew,2007-12-04 12:37:00,12767,"I like the sounds of this, Brian"
139584,irishfield,2007-12-04 22:35:00,26272,"As I told Brian, Lew...will be a LAST minute decision. Daughter #1 going in for more tests at St. Micheals Thur afternoon and daughter #2, in Ottawa, needing things this weekend as well. We'll see how it goes and if Leah is able to cover both."
139688,bpsbassman,2007-12-05 01:48:00,941,"Was hoping to at least join you for lunch, but have to work that day. Go get'em boyz!!"
139693,fishdawg,2007-12-05 02:10:00,912,dosent look like i'll be able to make it as I had hoped
139929,irishfield,2007-12-05 21:01:00,26272,Sorry guys... I'm now officially a NO for the niagara!  Wayne
