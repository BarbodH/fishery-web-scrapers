141527,Guest skeeter99,2007-12-11 04:42:00,0,"dry cold  in southern ontario, there is always alot more humidity it is -15 and damp to put it a better way (it goes right through you instantly)  but lets say about north bay up it can be -30 (yes it is cold) but like a desert (no humidity)  but come down to southern -5 60% humidity and feels like -30  it is just geographical location being surrounded by the great lakes"
