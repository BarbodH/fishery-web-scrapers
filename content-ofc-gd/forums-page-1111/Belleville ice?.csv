140753,Joeytier,2007-12-08 20:55:00,3990,Is anyone aware of the water conditions in the Belleville area?  I am looking to head out tomorrow and don't want to drive all the way there just to see ice.
140822,DT10Sam,2007-12-09 01:47:00,480," Hi Joeytier,  The water conditions here in Belleville are extremely hard right now.  We have ice from Trenton all the way to Belleville with many areas that are not safe.  There are not areas that have open water or boat ramps that are accessible other than Glenora Ferry which is jammed with boats and you will have to break some ice to get the boat out.  Hope I am not late in getting this message to you.  Regards, Sam"
