140166,bigbuck,2007-12-06 19:41:00,2449,Looks like I gotta get digital cable. I'm still in the stone ages with REGULAR BASIC CABLE. I figure there's only a few shows that I watch regularly and as long as daddy gets the tv on Saturday mornings to get my fix of fishing shows it's all good.
140292,Shaun Rickard,2007-12-07 03:39:00,144,"If you're reading these Dave, Great job! Excellent show and very well done. I enjoyed watching and will do so again for sure.  My hats off to yourself and your talented crew.  Continued success mate!  Cheers, Shaun"
140325,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-07 12:00:00,2585,i missed it but sure hope they will replay it this weekend sometime!  Cheers!
140457,Mike Pike,2007-12-07 17:15:00,1332,Cogeco sucks in Hamilton too Rick!  No WFN here either!!!  Lots of channels with dog shows and ghost stories though...  You suck Cogeco!
140601,Dave Mercer,2007-12-08 02:31:00,148,"Hi Guys, Sorry I did not get a chance to reply sooner. I have been super busy since Wednesday night. I have to be honest, I have been totally blown away with all the posts and literally hundreds of emails we have received at our new site about THE SHOW. You have no idea how much all of your feedback means to us. We all worked very hard on this show. Your comments in the past and present have helped shape The Show to what it is. Hopefully we can keep giving you all what you want.  Also, thank you to all of you who have sent emails to WFN as viewer feedback goes along way especially with a new show. OFC'ers are truly the greatest!  Once again thank you all ever much.  Dave Mercer  P.S For those of you that missed it, this week's show will be repeated Sat at 6PM and Sun at 6AM"
141202,blizzcat,2007-12-10 07:56:00,92,I don't have WFN but I told my boyfriend to watch it! when I told him it was dave's show he was already saying how he already has dvds of dave's. But he said the show was great  wish i coulda seen it!
139980,TJQ,2007-12-06 00:26:00,7806,I just watched it for the second time and It was just as good.  I think that the humor is something sorely lacking in fishing shows these days...  He's definatley Canada's Jared!!!
139983,Gerritt,2007-12-06 00:28:00,6129,I was trying to count how many times he was nekking with the bass... but lost count on the one mule!!... I hope his wife likes fish!  LOL!   Awesome show!  Gerritt.
139985,Joey,2007-12-06 00:29:00,9122,Just as funny as the first time.  Its going to be a great show.  Ya gotta love the laugh  Joey
139987,TJQ,2007-12-06 00:30:00,7806,The laugh just kills me...  its its own trademark...
139990,fishindevil,2007-12-06 00:34:00,6254,The show was great i really think he is going to do very well !!!!
139991,Terry,2007-12-06 00:34:00,14456,it was good and I would watch it again.......  seems his humor is the same as mine I posted the punch line about the contest before I saw the show   I think  Jared lost more
139992,motv8tr,2007-12-06 00:41:00,2587,"Yup, just as good 2nd time around   Good stuff Dave!!!  Maureen"
139995,bassboy,2007-12-06 00:44:00,161,Awesome show! Will I watch it again? Most definitely! Best fishing show I have seen in a long time. Nice to see a real person do a fishing show.... But be warned....dont eat dinner or have anything to drink while watching.....you may have a mess or two to clean up!!  Fantastic job Dave......cant wait for more!!  Bill
139998,Weeds,2007-12-06 00:56:00,782,I thought it was good too. The intro was the best bit with that first cast. Looked real familliar.
140000,sonny,2007-12-06 01:00:00,511,I enjoyed the show alot!!  and maybe the next time out i'll be trying the drop shot method....Maybe a method i am not using enough??
140001,Bernie,2007-12-06 01:01:00,3190,Dang....I missed it. Just got home from WORK!!
140002,ccmtcanada,2007-12-06 01:12:00,7971, Bernie....set up your VCR...it's on again at 1am!
140009,huntervasili,2007-12-06 01:58:00,1604,I enjoyed it... Humor was great and not only does it have great info but its entertaining too. WTG on the show Dave
140010,Bernie,2007-12-06 02:01:00,3190,Thank you very much Cliff. If I can just figure out the dvd recorder I've had for 2 years that has never been used to record! Now where are those darn instructions
140012,K-K-DAWG,2007-12-06 02:08:00,31,"Nice going Dude, Both entertaining and informative-   You should be proud.... even my girls liked your laugh!  K-Dawg http://www.extremeanglertv.com   p.s. Welcome to the jungle - Axel Rose."
140014,bigfish1965,2007-12-06 02:18:00,3382,Cogeco sucks...why can't I have WFN??? They have it in freekin Sturgeon Falls. They only just got indoor plumbing three years ago!
140015,bpsbassman,2007-12-06 02:32:00,941,I had high expectations for this show and it did not disappoint.  Dave is such a genuine class act.  You have to love that he is not afraid to laugh at himself and his laugh is so infectious.  I think the show should go places. Can't wait for the next episode. Way to go Dave!!
140021,huntervasili,2007-12-06 03:29:00,1604,"I already have the series set to record so I don't miss a single one... I didn't even realize it but I have been wearing the facts of fishing shirt all day too, guess i was excited eh... lol"
140028,HTHM,2007-12-06 04:26:00,4082,"Canadian content......darn I hope CBC will pick this up, then I can see it too."
140033,wuchikubo,2007-12-06 06:37:00,1114,"It was a good show, I got home just as it started and the kids watched it with me too. I just finished watching it again as I thought I might have missed something with the kids making noise the first time around.  WTG Dave!"
140046,cranks bait,2007-12-06 13:13:00,721,"Great show!!!  My wife watched it with me.  When it was over she was like ""that's it?, it hasn't been half an hour yet!""  She was impressed that the show didn't drag on like others.  She actually rewound the BETA and watched it again. Great job Dave!!! Can't wait to see more.  Oh ya, gotta love the boat.  Pretty much the exact thing I am after."
140056,ccmtcanada,2007-12-06 14:20:00,7971,"The show was just as good the second time around.  This is one show I will watch...it makes fishing real.  Dave's laugh is priceless and you can really tell he's having a great time.  I do on occasion watch other fishing shows, but I'll never fish in exotic locations for exotic fish.  I can at least use some of the tips for the species I'm used to targeting.  Great job Dave!  Look forward to more episodes!"
140125,TJQ,2007-12-06 17:57:00,7806,"From the time of the entries submitted, its interesting.  It looks like alot of people watched it at 1 am and alot PVR'ed it as well!"
140133,ccmtcanada,2007-12-06 18:06:00,7971," Yep...we were late in watching it early, so we missed some of it...recorded the 1am show so we could see the entire thing.  So...what time is the draw??"
140135,TJQ,2007-12-06 18:08:00,7806,"Hopefully, If I can get ahold of Dave, it will be this afternoon sometime.. hes likely pretty busy today, and HE is randomly drawing the winners.... otherwise I would win three times... lol   (you buggers... i never get any prizes...)"
