They say the roads are slick, and as usual take particular care on the ramps.  Guess I'll see how good my new tires are today  Play safe  Maureen"
141271,irishfield,2007-12-10 15:36:00,26272,Hope you made it safe Maureen... Leah left for Ottawa at 6am heading across 12/7
141400,motv8tr,2007-12-10 21:48:00,2587,"Hey Wayne, safe trip down 12 to Oshawa and back, I guess all the slippery stuff was on the 400/401/404   I'm sure Leah had no problems at all.  I think we left around the same time, but she likely passed me when I made one of my 3 stops on the way down  Maureen"
141424,irishfield,2007-12-10 22:22:00,26272,She made it fine! She knows the drill for winter driving... put it in 4 wheel drive and drive over anything that gets in your way! I taught her well ! LOL
