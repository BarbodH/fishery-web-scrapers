141447,kingjames_2nd,2007-12-10 23:06:00,72,"I got slapped with jury duty twice and audited by the tax man all before turning 22.  I told the court people I ws a student and couldnt take time away from school and avoided those ones.  The tax man was a different story.  I had claimed my rent  for the year but had no reciept.  the tax man wanted a  recpiept  but my land lady being the scum hose that she was,  wouldnt pass one over.  so after alot of hastle  I  ended up paying the tax man the money he said I owed,  moved out of the town house and havent delt with those government types since.

141468,Handlebarz,2007-12-11 00:39:00,3790,Dang Brian dounds like you had a fun filled day.  I was called a couple years ago we all sat there for a long time the judge was also sitting on the bench not looking happy as there was no defence there (ala balitmore last night) he then had another person aproch him and tell him that there as a agreement the night before or on the Friday befoer I forget which day but this made him super happy as he assured us that the person who waisted our time would make it up for all of us and there was 1 person who was a no show he also assured us that they would be sitting in the court to make up the time for each of us so as I see it if there was 100 of us for 3 hours they would get to sit there for 300 hrs it pays to show up.

141383,carp-starter,2007-12-10 21:10:00,253,"In July 1981 I was transferred from Montreal to Toronto. Within 1 month I received a letter stating that I was to appear at the Brampton court house for jury duty in November. These guys were quick.  So in November I show up. Also over 100 people also show up. After about an hour, we were given the instructions about jury selection.  Attendance was taken. We were informed that we would be there selection for one week unless picked to be a juror. Juries had to be selected for many court cases – not just one case. There was a drum that held the names of all the people.  The first court case came up sometime Monday morning. The drum was rotated and a name was selected. There were lawyers there for the prosecution and for the defence. The jury member selected was either accepted or rejected by the lawyers. If your name was rejected, your name went back into the drum for the next court case otherwise, you were now a real jury member. The next name was selected and the procedure was repeated until the required number of people for the case were selected and accepted.  Once the jury was selected for the case, the next case came up and the above procedure was repeated. This went on for the rest of the week. I was stuck there for a maximum of 1 week unless I got accepted for a court case.  My name was selected from the drum on Monday morning. I was quickly accepted by the lawyer for the defence. Just as quickly, I was rejected by the lawyer for the prosecution. The case involved someone who sold drugs and the guy looked “”mean”. My hair at that time was long and so I think it was because of my hair that the prosecution rejected me and the defence accepted me. Sometimes a lawyer would question a person selected.  My name went back into the drum for other cases.  On Tuesday, the whole thing was repeated. My name never came up. The same took place on Wednesday and Thursday. My name was never selected.  When I showed up on Friday, I wanted to hide because on my final day I did not want to become a real juror and be stuck there for another 2 or 3 weeks.  My name never was selected after the first time on Monday.  It was a waste of my time doing nothing. Bring a book. We were paid about 4 or 5 bucks per day.  Since it was the first time for me, the whole thing was very interesting.  carp-starter"
141390,kickingfrog,2007-12-10 21:27:00,8333,"I was in Barrie court today for the jury pool. It was a criminal case and before they got to me they had their 12 jurors. It still took until noon though.  BTW The shield/ crest in the Barrie court was identical as far as I remember, however the text was deferent and definitely Latin, too bad my last class was 20 years ago."
141395,SlowPoke,2007-12-10 21:33:00,2984,"The selection process would have been the same in my case but as I understand it they only select jurors once a week outside the GTA area. Those not selected would be sent home and in some cases called back the following Monday. I think I was fortunate that this court only had one case to select for as other cases may have lapsed over the holidays. From talking to other perspective jurors, if you call in advance and offer to juror at a later date (bad timing, travel, financial reasons etc) they will most likely give you options. If you select the last available date before Christmas you are likely up for a very short trial if you are even selected. Then you're off the hook until the next time. -Brian"
141397,motv8tr,2007-12-10 21:41:00,2587,"Ok, other than financial reasons, why do so many people want to avoid jury duty?  I know the system is a pain in the butt, I spent the morning in court today, second day as a witness in a trial by judge.  I recieved a questionaire regarding jury duty, and have no problem serving on one if I am called to do so.  Maureen"
