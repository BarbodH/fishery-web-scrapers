140716,Handlebarz,2007-12-08 15:27:00,3790,Next season I want to try and run a underwater camera for musky fishing when were troling I want to be able to see what the lures are doing down there as I have some ideas I want to try and see exactly what they are doing for me can anyone point me in the right direction as to what camera I should look into and I also want to be able to record the trips. I will need one that will track right at speeds up to 4.5-5mph usually slower but it would be nice if they would stay on track at higher speeds.  Also anyinfo from people who have tried this with tips on where to start for rigging the camera up..thanks Mike
140751,TJQ,2007-12-08 20:22:00,7806,Your gonna have trouble trolling with them that fast.  It will definatley take some experimentation...

Charlie White's Fishing Machine was a T.V. show that used a camera to watch trolled salmon lures and their action and the preference of the salmon. I remember the show saying that only 1 in 10 following fish even took a swipe at the offerings. See if you can find something on the internet about his set-up, he is the King of trolling a camera."
140897,Big Cliff,2007-12-09 10:39:00,6899,I have an Aqua View Scout but it wouldn't be suitable for trolling at those speeds.
140974,Uncle Buck,2007-12-09 16:56:00,1000,"my logic is, if you get one shaped like a fish, what's to stop the musky from taking a bite at it?"
140983,Big Cliff,2007-12-09 17:42:00,6899,"ya but what a shot that would make!!!!!!!  Actually though there are reports of big pike taking a shot at them, some even damaging the wires."
140993,Clausewitz,2007-12-09 19:07:00,19,I think you are going to have some trouble at those speeds.  Maybe go for something that can handle a lower speed and pull it back up for the faster speeds?
141341,Handlebarz,2007-12-10 19:36:00,3790,I know I would not be using one of the bluegill ones I have been looking around the net and seen some others but they all seem to need a pole for running them I just thought with the ammount of people that we have here some would have done this before.  The main speed would be 3.5mph but I thought I would ask if there was ones that would hold up for the higher speeds.  I will try looking up Charlie White  and see what I can gather from that.
