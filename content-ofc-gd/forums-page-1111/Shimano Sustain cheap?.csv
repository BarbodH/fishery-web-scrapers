141056,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-09 21:33:00,1351,oh shoot.. looks like there is only one model.. SA-5000FD.. that is on sale.
141059,Photoz,2007-12-09 21:42:00,792,"I have 2 - 4000 Sustains . . .    nice reels . . . . .    but the Stradic is not much more than half the price, a better deal I'd say?"
141080,fishindevil,2007-12-09 23:21:00,6254,"Hey kevin,if you were planning to spend that amount of cash on a reel....man go for the stradic !!!!     man they are amazing ,and last forever....for the price there isnt anything that is better,so think twice and check one out in your hand before you buy,then you will see/feel what i mean,with 6:2:1 retrieve,man you can just burn those baits big time...  .is this a xmas present from the girl friend????..LOL..LOL..LOL.   cheers buddy"
141083,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-09 23:37:00,1351,"the sustain..naww...if i was to get another reel, it'd be a line counter or the shimano castaic. don't want it that much just thought someone on the board might... i got my eye on a few items...  like a kicker or a hut"
141188,Garry2Rs,2007-12-10 04:42:00,1425,"The spinning reel your talking about is one above the Stradic...so the price is truly excellent.  They have been discounted down because Shimano just brought out a new model.  BUT you should go to a dealer and have a look at the size before you order... In my opinion, the 5000 is a very BIG reel."
