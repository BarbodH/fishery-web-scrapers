Went out drilled 8 or so holes and dropped the lines for pike... although we didn't get any hits, it was great to see I can now get out for Pike... Also have a nice semi permanent cooler on the ice which you can see in my pics  holds 8 pop but might just need to be expanded, sure does keep em ice cold... lol Here's the cooler boys   and the fishing area:   Well maybe next time I will have some fish with the report... Until then stay safe on the ice and Tight lines  Bill"

140727,huntervasili,2007-12-08 17:58:00,1604,"I was itching to get out so I was cautious and did, and am happy to have gone, even though I didnt get anything... It is early so if ya do venture out be really careful, because most lakes aren't that good right now... Hmmm, will I also be the first to post a SUCCESSFUL ice report this season?"
