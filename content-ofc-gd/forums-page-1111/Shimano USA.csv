141279,wkrp,2007-12-10 16:18:00,656,Good news I emailed shimano and their response was that the rebate will be available in Canada within 3 or 4 weeks time. Thats a $50 dollar saving on a Curado. Great customer service on shimano`s part as I emailed them late Friday and they responded Monday morning. There`s a Curado 201DPV out there with my name on it.
