141217,rhare,2007-12-10 11:59:00,387,"Went out this weekend to do some early season ice fishing. The conditions where tough. Low pressure made it really hard to find fish. We spent a couple hours Saturday in the Orillia area trying our luck at some eyes. The ice conditions seemed pretty good. Anywhere from 3-6"" of blackice. I was really surprised that there wasnt more snow on the ice. we moved around a bit and had some nice fish come in and bump the bait around a bit but no takers.   heres a pick of the ice depth     On sunday we decided to head north to a backwoods splake lake. After seeing the ice depth in orillia we thought it would be great up north. I hadent fished the lake for almost 3 winters, but we had decent sucess before ( 10 in a day) .   We worked the lake up and down trying to track down some fish but NOTHING...   Had a coulpe small fish follow the spoon around but that was it.     The lake up north ( bracebridge area)   ARE NOT SAFE!!!!!!    there is lots of snow on top causing inconsistant freezing. IF YOU DONT KNOW THE LAKE WAIT A COUPLE WEEKS.  ( 4"" of snow--- 1.5"" ice---2"" water---1""-6""ice) The bait shops have no minnows right now for a couple weeks so if you do head out bring the metal.   Lake looked sweet      Dan drilling some run and gun holes   Ice shot "
