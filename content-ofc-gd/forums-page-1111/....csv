140582,tapout,2007-12-08 00:59:00,166,"Glad to see you're on the mend Glen.  And misfish...whats up with telling him to hit the screech anyway?  Thats stuff is horrible and not even a newfie drink. Sheeesh.  Now Iceberg Vodka.  Thats made right on the rock with all the ingredients from there.  Well I think the bottles might be imported.  lol.   I had a scare on Tuesday.  Got up to go to work and being an ex smoker....will be one year on Jan. 2nd since I quit....I still have to clear my lungs in the morning, much to the dismay of the others I live with.  Not pleasant sounding for anyone being awaken by my hacking and coughing.  Anyway I felt a little worst then normal but decided to make my way to work anyway.  Stopped off at an Esso station to grab a timmies coffee.  You know the ones where you have to go in and mix your own.  And NO I didn't add any kaluha to it.  Anyway my stomach started churning and I ran outside....left my half made coffee there.  I didn't make it across the gas bay with out decorating it with my breakfast.  Still didn't feel like I was done and proceded to decorate the snow drift at the side of the gas station.  Once I was satisfied that I had no decorations left I went in and grabbed my coffee, paid for it and as I was heading to my car I felt like I had to clear my lungs again....but this time the phlegm was full of blood.  Man was I frightened to death.  turned around immediately and went home and went to the doc.  He checked my out and said I look and sound fine now and what happened was during my hacking fit I burst a couple of small blood vessels in the back of my throat.  First thing he thought was it might be  pneumonia.  No it wasn't thankfully.  Spooked the hell outta me though."
