141118,chickenhawk,2007-12-10 01:05:00,612,Well this year I was introduced to completely new waters to me as I am originally from the Aylmer/St. Thomas area so I was uneasy as to what to expect.  Well I have to say for the first time fishing these new tribs it was probably one of my best years to date but then again I still have a couple more trips planned for this year when I return home for a couple weeks at the end of my semester.  Well Salmon season came and went this year and of course I witnessed just about every illegal thing in the book and even had some of the buggers bite my roe bag.  Here is my first salmon of the year which gave me a nice hefty amount of orange roe.  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...dirtyfemale.jpg  Next up was a big old male which I thought made a cool picture...  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...k11/bigmale.jpg  I thought this one that grabbed onto my roe bag was different looking so I snapped a picture of her and sent it on her way.  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...ownsyndrome.jpg  Then this ol girl was my next surprise of the year.  Nothing like rainbow crack!!! LOL  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...femalebrown.jpg  Which brings me to steelhead! and what a great year it was for them!  They were in the rivers by mid-October and we were already putting big numbers of fish up with having more than a couple 10+ fish days in October. On this particular day the water was low and clear and it seemed that the only fish we would catch were the ones I caught at first light.  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c.../puresilver.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/nicefish.jpg  Once the sun came up we could see that the holes were filled with fish but all lockjaw not even looking at our roe bags.  So we tossed in a handful of chum with a single egg on our hook and i'll just let the pics do the talking ended up landing around 10 fish each that day.  Here are a couple of my favourite pics from that day.  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/102_2234.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/102_2239.jpg  Here are a couple of just random pictures of fish I caught this year..  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/100_2227.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/100_2228.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/102_2233.jpg  This big boy I nailed under a tree on single egg once again....seemed to be the hot bait this year when the water was still warm.  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...0lbercloser.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/SSPX0004.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...wk11/10lber.jpg  Which brings me to my most recent outing and man am I ever glad I have rainbow crack because that is what produced these late November steelhead......  I was surprised to see how dark this male was....I actually thought it might have been a dirty old late salmon when I first hooked it because of how dark it was..... http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/SSPX0002.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/SSPX0001.jpg  And now finally all from the same day my new PB and what a gorgeous fish I must say.....  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...11/SSPX0003.jpg  So there you have it my 2007 Steelhead season but like I said I still have a couple more trips planned but after that time to put away the waders and the 9.5 ft and bring out the ice rods and floater suit! This year I am looking forward to jigging lakers on Lake Simcoe so I am sure I will meet some of you out there and I have also met some of you on the river.  Good luck in 2008 or in this years hardwater season!!!  I also should mention that all fish in this report were hooked in the mouth and were released to swim another day except for the first salmon and of course the brown trout....sorry guys!!
