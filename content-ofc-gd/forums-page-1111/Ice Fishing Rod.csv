140262,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-12-07 01:38:00,135,"Hi Everyone,  I wanna buy my first ice fishing rod this year and I have absolutely no idea what to get.  I asked my buddy and he told me not to buy one.......just use piece of a hockey stick and some line   Anyway, I will most likely be fishing for perch, pike and pickeral.  I'm looking for an all purpose rod & reel that will be the best bang for my $.  Nothing expensive, but reliable and good enough that it won't freeze.  Thank you in advance and Merry Christmas to all!"
140266,jeffw,2007-12-07 01:44:00,267,If I were you I would checkout the new genz stix or if you don't want to sped $40 then just buy a ultralight frabil rod witht the spring bobber for panfish ( $11.99 at lebarons) and a shakespere razor or a ugly stick in the 4-8lb range. Cheers Jeff

140276,huntervasili,2007-12-07 02:35:00,1604,"If ya want one for pike and Big 'eyes, go for a med heavy or so rod and get a spring tip so you can use it for perch and the like... Frabill is pretty good for perch and panfish and I have a st croix for pike and eyes"
140342,chickenhawk,2007-12-07 12:35:00,612,Just as Danc put it
140502,cityfisher,2007-12-07 20:30:00,959,i have 3 frabill Spring perch rods that are Great... 2lb-4lb test and your good to go !  For whities / lakers i use what med action rod good for jigging.. just need some backbone and im good to go... I have so many i cant think of what brand
140503,misfish,2007-12-07 20:35:00,29133,I would have to 2nd the genz stix. I like to use the 3-4 foot rods.
140587,FinS,2007-12-08 01:18:00,463,go with the willow branches like DANC said add some good line a hook n minnow and sinker and a red ribbon and your set no need for ice rods espeacially if you dont pay attention to them as they dissapear quickly if the pike are lurking around  then again if u like perch  fishing the panfish popper is a good combo  but for pickeral and pike stick with the willow branch and if not a piece of hockey stick clothes hanger and a small spool of line will be good
140648,camillj,2007-12-08 05:15:00,1988,"  I'm with Dan ... nothing beats a supple twig stuck into the slush beside your hole ... line right off the spool tossed a few yards away in the snow ... except maybe this ... (because perfect twigs arent always easy to find) ...     Notice the jingle bells, the rubberised release mechanism (from a skirt hanger) ... the glow stick for strike indication in the dark ... and the infinitely adjustable wire which can be bent to be more sensitive on quiet days or a little stiffer in the wind ... and as a bonus just wrap a cigarette tinfoil (or black electrical tape like in the second rod in the background) around the line to catch the wind for that little 'extra wiggle'  and to be able to see that the line is still set in the release from a distance ... patent pending"
140785,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-12-08 23:35:00,135,"I went to BPS today and ran into Greg Klatt.  He was working there, although he was wearing an Ice fishing shirt?  Not a BPS one.  Anyway, he was extremely helpful (Thank you Greg) and along with everyone's help from here...... I was able to buy a Frabill rod&reel set up and some line that suits my needs.  Although I will also try DanC's suggestion and try a willow branch as a secondary set up for another hole.  I'm sure it will work just as well!  Any lure suggestions  for perch, pike and pickeral?  I found the selection at BPS a little overwhelming since this method of fishing is new to me.  Thanks guys for all the info and advice guys.  I truly appreciate it."
