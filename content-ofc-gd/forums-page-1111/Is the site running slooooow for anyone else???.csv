141055,Mike Pike,2007-12-09 21:31:00,1332,Just wanted to know if anyone else has been experiencing a slowness with the site these last few days or is it just me.  Thanks for your responses.
141062,Beans,2007-12-09 22:09:00,3339,Not consistantly...but it has had its moments when I thought maybe my system had crashed or sumpin'...getting spoiled since moving to high speed with my cable compny...
141063,Mike Pike,2007-12-09 22:14:00,1332,"And ya know, Beans, the thing that makes me think there might be something wrong with the site is the Rick's other site( the Niagara board )is also running slow.  I'm not having any other surfing issues other than these two sites, which is why I thought I'd bring it up."
