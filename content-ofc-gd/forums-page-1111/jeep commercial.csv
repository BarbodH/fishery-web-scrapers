140858,Fisherman,2007-12-09 03:42:00,7201,"Rant    It seems like most of the auto/truck mfgrs have hired a bunch of pea brained idiots to come up with advertising, Jeep has a bunch of singing wildlife jumping in through the sunroof, then there's some Lion idiot growling at spanky looking women, the nutbar driving the Ford pickup on the dirtbike track,  come on, can't they think of anything intelligent to entice buyers."

140905,pikehunter,2007-12-09 12:24:00,1659,"Skeeter nailed it. Doesn't matter if you find a commercial funny, sexy, appealing or irritating. They grabbed your attention and you remember the product being pitched.  I found the commercial funny and I enjoy a comical advertisement. My favourite are the older Casino Rama ads.  Remember the controversy recently over the Hyundai commercial where the female cop pulls the guy over and _ _ _ _ _ _ the guy and tosses out the ticket? Great ad and it got so much attention it  was taken off the air.  I think a lot of people need to lighten up. Some programing is so bad these days that commercials are the highlight!"
140917,Fisherman,2007-12-09 13:56:00,7201,"Ha, Ha, they may have grabbed my attention by showing me a ad that I might remember, but,  I would consider it nothing much more than something dreamed up by a bunch of cavemen/women.  When I see that, I generally equate the commercial/ad and waste of money to that product and don't buy it."
