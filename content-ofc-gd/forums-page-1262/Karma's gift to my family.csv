40134,aplumma,2007-02-26 12:13:00,6896,Cisco truer words have never been spoken. One of the reasons we decided to get the boat is so that Paul and Alison can still go down and weekend on the boat if they want. The area we are going to dock it at is about 45 min down river from the nations capitol their are lots to do their and the sight at night is beautiful. Thanks everyone for your well wishes we hope to have it in the water and fishing for this spring Striper run. The poor gas milage does not scare us My pick up truck gets  12-16 mpg and Joes get 9 mpg so what the h*ll whats another gas sucking pig in the family.  Art
40161,ccmtcanada,2007-02-26 13:20:00,7971,WHOA!! Awesome boat!  As was said many times before...good things happen to good people.  Congrats and may you have day after day of great times on the water!
40181,express168,2007-02-26 14:14:00,327,"Awesome boat!, and like people say it is not karma, it was your sincere actions as a friend that rewarded you. A saying that a martial arts instructor once mentioned to me is "" DESTINY COMES BY CHOICE, NOT BY CHANCE! "" And your sincere actions dictated this destiny. Enjoy the boat and your ongoing friendship with the other couple."
40204,Beans,2007-02-26 14:57:00,3339,Nice...very very nice
40216,dustink,2007-02-26 15:42:00,526,Wow.....that is great!  Congrats on the new boat & enjoy!  dk
40222,pikehunter,2007-02-26 15:58:00,1659,Nice cruiser!    What goes around comes around. I'm sure your going to have some great memories on your new boat
40225,seanik,2007-02-26 16:07:00,38,"Hello Art and welcome to the Marinette faternaty, Over the past years I have owned 3 Marinettes, a 28' express. a 32' flybridge and a 37' sedan flybridge. All were great boats and as you can see the bigger boat itius infected me thourghly. The 28"" express got about 2 mpg at crusing speed which is much more mpg than a comparable glass boat. The bottom requires a special anti fouling paint to keep down corrosion problems. The Marinettes are very popular here on Lake Erie and there is much information on them on the net. They were made in Louisville , Kentucky and the company went out of business in the early 1990's. If you need information or advice please email, I got to know these boats very well since I did all the required maintaince on them.  Jerry"
39840,aplumma,2007-02-25 17:05:00,6896,"Over the years I have made alot of friends.... A family that I have been lucky enough to know are the Diamonds. We have been friends for 15 years and they have let me repair their plumbing and asked my advise thru life in many areas. I also have sought their advise and wisdom when I have questions. Well time has taken it's toll on Paul and Alison's health and they no longer can handle taking the boat out for cruises so they have decided to offer the boat to me and my family. After a discussion with My family, Joe's family and my Mom and Pop we have decided to accept the boat. The boat will be moved were it is docked 2 hours away to a place that is closer when the weather get good enough to run the 160 miles by water to its new home. Joe and I went yesterday to look at the boat and got a few pictures that I will post.  The boat is a 28Ft Marinette with an 11 Ft beam. It has twin screws with 318 v8 chrysler motors cruising speed is 20 knots and top speed is 32 knots Weight is 7,000 Lbs dry fuel is gas with a 100 gal tank the boat sleeps 4  but can cruise 8 comfortable The hull and sub structure is all aluminum  which makes the boat light and durable    Paul and Alison thanks again for this awsome gift and even these words are pale in comparison to what we all mean.  Art,Karen,Joe,Becky,Joy and Ron"
39848,Joey,2007-02-25 17:31:00,9122,"You are right Art, Karma works in mysterious ways, but its true.  That is just fantastic and couldn't have happened to nicer people.  Enjoy your new boat  Joey"

40026,Daplumma,2007-02-26 01:09:00,1961,"Thats gonna be a Striper killer for sure.The boat is in amazing shape!Paul kept up with it pretty well but I dont think he took her out much.300 bux to fill her up and she gets about 1 mpg at full speed from what I understand.Or is that 1 GPM?Come springtime we will be rigging her properly for Stripers with rod holders and beer.The trolling motor is a challenge.need about a 6 ft shaft foot control with 300 lb thrust,I like the Minnkota stuff wonder do they make one that size? Joe"
40033,Nanook,2007-02-26 01:25:00,565," Now thats a boat and a half Art, lotsa holidays in that one. If ya ever decide to do the Trent system, give us a shout!!!!  Kudo's to ya."

40067,Big Cliff,2007-02-26 02:19:00,6899,"Good on you!  Now, you have to move that boat 160 miles and that can be a bit of a challange depending on where it is and where you want it. If you nee some experienced help, let me know. I have a very good friend who has a 36' trawler and has navigated everything from FL to Northern Ontario. I just know he would be happy to help out if I asked him.  By the way..... Good things happen to good people!"
40087,cisco,2007-02-26 03:25:00,597,"Congratulations!  I imagine the Diamonds will still get a few enjoyable""guest trips"" with you folks on their old friend. Giving the boat to your family was probably as good a good feeling to them as it was to you."
40090,kennyman,2007-02-26 03:55:00,737,"Wow,that's incredible. You know what they say,""good things come to good people"". Have fun with her you lucky devil."

40095,irishfield,2007-02-26 04:06:00,26272,You'll have to trailer that up to Lakair...and we'll all just go out in your boat bud!  LOL
40111,OhioFisherman,2007-02-26 06:50:00,6623,"Marinette`s are very nice boats, the 28`s were pretty popular here on Lake Erie. The 318 Chysler crusaders are good engines, on a lot of boats. Always liked the more classic boat look of the Marinette over the SeaRays and Wellcrafts.  11 foot beam is great, big difference in the amount of room. My SeaRay on had like a 70 gallon tank, one engine a 351 ford. Twins gives you better control for docking. Ya miles per gallon won`t compare with a car! LOL  http://www.yachtworld.com/core/listing/dis...hoto=1&url=  Nice Art!"
