40383,aplumma,2007-02-26 22:55:00,6896,"Well at least here in the states we don't have the dreaded ""Anal Lizards"" swimmin in the water.I was up North and a lady was swimmin around and a few of us informed  her to splash and make noise while swimmin to scare any of the little buggers away. I am not sure she believed us but she did get out of the water quickly and would not dive off the cliff with us for the rest of the week.  Art"
39252,Bly,2007-02-24 01:59:00,1556," Rich,  You should be able to find Ketchup chips is PA...they are made by a company called Herrs.    We have a candy called Smarties but they are what Canadians call ""Rockets"" and oddly enough, they are made in Canada  hehe"

39264,Guest lundboy,2007-02-24 02:15:00,0,"I remember standing in line in a burger joint in downtown Toronto, and a couple from the US were in front of me ordering fries and burgers and they were asked if they wanted gravy on them.  They were so disgusted!  That was just before they started serving Poutine in Toronto so it was a while ago. Can you imagine if that couple was asked if they wanted Cheese and Gravy??  I have noticed on US TV KFC is now advertising KFC Famous Bowls:  ""We start with a generous serving of our creamy mashed potatoes, layered with sweet corn and loaded with bite-sized pieces of crispy chicken. Then we drizzle it all with our signature home-style gravy and top it off with a shredded three-cheese blend. It's all your favorite flavors coming together.""  It's still not Poutine, but they are coming around!"
39268,John Bacon,2007-02-24 02:24:00,3277,  Even more so if it was cheese curds and gravey; which is how true poutine is made.
39270,PatB,2007-02-24 02:27:00,104,You people are so young. When we were knee high to a crow we would go down to the corner store buy a bag of chips then run home a load them up with ketchup. That is a ketchup chip.
39307,joonmoon,2007-02-24 05:04:00,528,Talk about a cornary...geez you guys and your gravy. Man that gravy and biscuit deal sure looks appetizing...NOT. Eat that and you can feel your heart skipping and missing a beat or two. Boy oh boy I'm sure glad I don't eat stuff like that....I'd be 400lbs and dead by now. Doesn't anyone eat healthy stuff....how about popcorn or granola bars or just fruit for a snack. I know I feel healthier just talking about eating healthier....lol.
39312,bigfish1965,2007-02-24 05:26:00,3382,Things you can't get in Florida (besides an accurate election).. Tea..you know regular damm tea. Nope..sorry. Vinegar for fries. Iced Tea (now you'd think iced tea would be everywhere there) Iced Tea and Vodka. We were drinking them after we found a bar that had iced tea and we were getting strange looks till the locals tried it and then we all got stewed on T and V. Decent coffee for your hangover.
39323,Ben_Daniels,2007-02-24 06:41:00,435,"In the states they have no ketchup chips, all dressed chips, Mr. Big's  and dont even mention a beavertail or poutine cause they'll think your crazy! I'm so glad im living in Canada."
39374,turtle,2007-02-24 12:50:00,274,"Ever tried ordering the other hangover drink -the ""Caesar"" (vodka and clamato) in the states, gets a few blank stares.  Been to Pittsburgh a few times, one of their specialties is a fish fillet on a bun with the fries on top of the fish in the sandwich.  BTW that pic looks like another specialty-the chicken fried steak."
39375,mattyk,2007-02-24 13:12:00,2110,"We have an imported food section here at one of our local grocery shops and they have some speciality canadian items like Ketchup chips, coffee crisp, aero. That was my biggest adjustment when i moved to Kentucky from ontario 3 1/2 years ago. I had to give up all my favorites like Harveys, Mr Sub, Tim Hortons, Coffee Crisp, Ketchup Chips"

39514,Marty,2007-02-24 22:15:00,873,"Pittsburgh's got the Primanti sandwiches, slaw and fries right on the sammich.  I eat 'em regularly.  Ketchup chips?   I don't care about them but like someone said above, in addition to the fishin', my Canada trips are for Coffee Crisps too.    I bring a box back every year."
39517,douG,2007-02-24 22:20:00,2693,"  That would be smoked meat, fries, coleslaw, a fried egg, tomato between two slices of Italian bread."
39565,Clampet,2007-02-24 23:51:00,1947, One of my favs is Grapefruit chunks with some Banana and Apple mixed in.

39587,holdfast,2007-02-25 00:44:00,1813,"Not to do with Ketchup chips but it was fun.  Us Canadians were on ex with the yanks in California and were told about the Black Widow.  So we took precautions.  bUTTT. When the Yanks went to Canada, Petawawa, IN THE WINTER. Poor Alabama Boy""  We told them about our snow snakes. Seems we had a hard time getting them out of the tents."
39608,Headhunter,2007-02-25 01:25:00,5703,"The only thing missing in that bisquit pic, is about 20 ounces of med rare Prime Rib! Meat, if it wan't good for you, the good lord wouldn't have put so much of it on the planet! HH"
39664,Carp,2007-02-25 03:13:00,1488,  You can add another zero Gerritt. NO FISH !!!  No worries bud. Most of us were in the same situation.
39687,Garyv,2007-02-25 04:04:00,547,"Maybe no Ketchup chips, but the Americans do have mild and hot Giardiniera ( Yummmmm ) as well as Glory different varieties of southern style vegetables.  Another favourite of mine is Andy Capps fries and................"
39693,Dabluz,2007-02-25 04:20:00,701,"Here in Quebec, a large portion of the population eat their french fries with mayonnaise or Kraft salad dressing.  Almost all hot dogs are fried and not ""steamed"".  To fry the hot dogs, they are split open before placing them on the grill.  The hot dog buns are also heated up and flattened on the grill.  Actually there are 2 types of hot dog buns.  One for steamed hot dogs and the other for fried hot dogs.  I had a fast food restaurant for a while and the american tourists just raved at how good the fried hot dogs were.  The usual added ingredients are cheddar cheeze, ketchup, fine chopped cabbage, fine chopped onion, relish, mustard or any combination of these ingredients.  Then the hot dog is slipped into a wax paper wrapping and french fries are added to the package before it is closed.  Yes, the vinegar and mayonnaise, plus a big tooth pick is nearby to complete the presentation."
39720,douG,2007-02-25 06:14:00,2693,"Dang, I'm getting hungry.  And those snow snakes can be just awful, worse than the black flies.  As for Giardiniera, I can find 4 types just across the street at the Italian deli."
39808,Garyv,2007-02-25 15:31:00,547," If you ever are in there pm me the brands they carry and if possible price.  I get mine in Pt Huron Mich at present, but would like to try a different brand."

40135,Greencoachdog,2007-02-26 12:14:00,8163,"Why in the world would anybody want to eat Ketchup chips when we have ""KC Masterpiece""Barbeque Sauce flavored barbeque potato chips??? They are THE BEST!!!!... and if y'all don't have them you need to try them the next time you're in the U.S.!"
39120,Gerritt,2007-02-23 22:03:00,6129,Do you guys seriously not have Ketchup Chips in the US?? I think someone is pulling my leg... how can this be!!!!   Gerritt.
39121,Woodsman,2007-02-23 22:09:00,1286,Ketchup Chips ?? Who really cares. Now just wait for the looks you'll get when you ask for vinegar for your fries.

39131,Bly,2007-02-23 22:24:00,1556,"Growing up in Michigan we had ketchup chips.  My mom used to buy them from this company that used to have trucks that went from one neighborhood to another...they also had great cookies and candies.  I think it was ""Charles Chips"" and everything came in large tins.  Personally didn't care for them, another thing Pamela Anderson and I will never have in common  LOL   bly"
39135,Eddyk,2007-02-23 22:31:00,195,Years ago I was in the Navy and we were in Helsiki Finland. I was wandering around the city one night and came across a hot dog vender and as I wasnt feeling any pain I ordered a hot dog. The vender heated the dog and put it on the bun and then put a huge scoop of mashed potatoes on top of it. Not to offend the vender I paid him and walked around the corner and gave the potatoes to some dogs. The hot dog was great but they didnt have mustard or relish. Thats my mini rant for today.
39140,Gerritt,2007-02-23 22:38:00,6129,"Dustink, they are potato chips that taste like ketchup LOL... and I never even thought that our buds down south dont have them!!! the most powerful country in the world... and you cant find a chip in ketchup flavour anywhere!!! man.....  I didnt know about the vinegar thing either lol...geeez I am batting ZERO today...  now good luck finding decent Biscuits N Gravy in Canada.... man I would kill for some of that right now!   Gerritt."

Mcmurry in the 80's there was a contract up for grabs for putting on miles and miles of weather stripplng on some buildings but they couldn't get anyone to do it because it went on with sloted screws. A buddy took the contract, threw away the slotted screws and got some robbies, made about $500 a day."

39161,douG,2007-02-23 23:12:00,2693,"Slotted screw , and Phillips / posidrive are crap compared the Robertson drive.  Can you believe that they are actually sold in the US as tamper-proof?.  Thank Henry Ford himself for this screw-up (he he he).  One of the best things about the Robertson screw is that you can drive the screw overhead with only one hand.  The screw just sticks on the driver, all by itslef."

39241,Northhunter,2007-02-24 01:40:00,214,I saw a list once of a lot of the junkfood that was unique to Canada. It was surprising - a lot of flavours of chips and a whack of other stuff. I don't think they have Smarties??  I tried to find a site that had a list - no luck.
39246,express168,2007-02-24 01:52:00,327,But our american friends still have the EXTRA CRISPY KFC. I know I am begging for a heart attack but KFC has to start selling just buckets of fried skin  . YUM!
39249,tbayboy,2007-02-24 01:57:00,1497,Oh man express your so right - they sold extra crispy up here for maybe 6 months.  My arteries are glad they stopped but damned if I don't get disappointed every time I go by a KFC now.  But then I remember that Americans can't get coffee crisp and all is well with the world.  Oh and for our American friends or ex-pats -Canada Only Sales
39250,douG,2007-02-24 01:58:00,2693,"http://canadianfavourites.com/index.html  Imagine no Robertson's marmalade, Kraft dinner, or Mclarens' IMperial cheddar?  Or Strubs' full sour dills?"
