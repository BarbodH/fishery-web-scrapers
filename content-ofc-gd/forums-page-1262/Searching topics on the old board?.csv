40593,ccmtcanada,2007-02-27 12:52:00,7971,"Unfortunately, it's bye bye for good.  It was up for a month or so after this one came online, then it went away.  Too bad...there was tons of great info on there!"
40613,dsn,2007-02-27 13:46:00,1018,Yeah it's gone. I saved a thread or book marked it. The one where I was fishing last summer with MJL all over the GTA and its gone. The link no longer works. Good thing I saved the pics!!   dsn
40633,radar,2007-02-27 14:28:00,138,"This board has been so great for so many years. I have found it useful to cut and save chunks in my OFC advise folder. I just bought my first boat (88 Springbok console -40hp in mint condition) and thought I saved some stuff on trailering and I found this:  Enjoy  Ratlletrap  don't recall reading Bill's tips, but just in case: 1) Cross your safety chains in an ""X"" pattern. 2) Make sure you have closed hooks on the chains where they attach to your hitch. 3) Make sure you have sufficient tongue weight. For your boat, this is probably around 100 pounds. 4) Make sure the trailer tires are properly inflated and have no cracks in the sidewalls. 5) Check the hubs for grease. Pull over after about 15 minutes of towing and feel the hubs. They should be cool. 6) Put your outboard motor in reverse gear to prevent the prop from spinning. 7) Make sure your front eye on the boat is chained to the trailer. Don't rely on the winch strap. 8) Use decent transom tie downs and snug them up. 9) Check all your trailer lights. Running, turn signals, brakes. You may need a second person for this. 10) Make sure your transom saver is in place or you have a travel lock on your power trim to save the wear and tear on the hydraulics.  Seems like a lot, but all in all it only takes a few minutes to run through and can prevent a spoiled trip.  Practice the towing and backing up in a parking lot until you are comfortable. Remember, the trailer will turn in the opposite direction of the wheel. Some people place their hand at the bottom of the wheel. This way, you move your hand in the same direction that you want the boat to go.  Good luck and take it slow!   ************************** Big All  If your having problem backing up hold your stearing wheel at the bottom. If you want your trailer to go right move your hand to the right and visevera for left. Good luck  ************************** Lost child  Leave lots of extra stopping room and following distance, especially in wet weather. When approaching hills try to get a run at them before going up, accellerate smoothly trying not too kick in the overdrive. Going down steeper hills control your speed, kinda 'fan' the brakes, lightly applying them for a couple seconds, every couple seconds, do not ride them. If you don't have them already a couple small convex spot mirrors on your main mirrors are great help both with passing and backing up, you get a bigger picture, albiet in smaller size.  Make sure your front and rear tiedown straps are secure, I always run a secondary attachment at the bow, I don't rely on just the winch cable/eyelet. Make sure you have a spare tire for the trailer and some tools. Spare bulbs and fuses.  As far as backing up goes, you have a couple of nice big industrail lots right there on Milner to practice in. More times then not, when backing up, people's biggest mistake is turning the wheels to far and overcorrecting...remember little turns. If you need help let me know. Good luck and be safe!   ************************** Fish farmer  Make sure you have everything ready for fishing before you get in line at the boat launch, like all the stuff you need in the boat, Life Jackets,100ft of Rope. Whistle, Flash light, Fire extinguisher,VHF radio, Bumpers, Tools, Vessel license, Boater operator card, Launching rope, Plug installed, Take tie downs off, DO NOT take your bow winch rope off till your boat is in the water far enough, seen a few boats laying on the ramp. Like a few mentioned, practice backing up before you get to the ramp. Meegs I've seen a few fights at the ramp. You don't want something like that to ruin a days fishing. Watch a few guys launching before you try so you can get a few tips. Good luck Meegs with your new toy, Go Get'em  ************************** ryanr  when at the ramp, 1..disconnect the electric plug and make sure the boat drain plug is properly INSTALLED. 2. take off the safety hook from the front of the boat if you have one....but leave the winch hook on and tight. 3. remove any rear straps and be sure your plug is in the transom. 4. when backing down the ramp, take the vehicle out of gear...... 5. if you have a bunk type trailer, with the carpeted pads and just one or two rollers, back down until your rear wheels touch water. Put into reverse and shut off engine....apply emergency brake. 6. walk back and climb into truck bed using the rear wheel to step on....go back and step over tailgate and onto trailer tongue....grab the launch rope, release the winch trigger by applying a little pressure on the handle and then tripping the trigger....crank out the strap a couple turns to get slack and take out the hook. Push boat in, keeping hold of the launch line. Climb back over tailgate and step down on wheel and then down on ramp. Tie boat, drive trailer up and park.  When putting boat back on trailer at the ramp, you don't back in so far. You want some of the trailer bed pads to be sticking halfway out of the water. The bed pads are the bottom pads, not the side guide pads. If the bed pads are submerged, the boat doesn't ""seat"" properly and will be tilted to one side most likely when pulled out. With some of the bed pads exposed, place vehicle in reverse, apply emergency brake and shut off enginge...get in boat and drive up, aligning the bow with the trailer winch...go slowly and when engaged with trailer, give a little gas until the bow rests against the winch roller. Put your boat motor in neutral, secure the boat motor... go to the front of the boat and secure winch hook....tighten as best you can from the boat. Now carefully step out the front and tighten the winch so the bow is against the roller securely. Step to the rear bumper of your truck and over the tailgate.  Pulling a 14 foot boat out does not take much power, so save your clutch if a stick shift and as the boat is generally light, you don't need much gas. Takes a little getting used to, but each time you launch and retrieve, it gets easier with observation. It helps a lot to practice backing it up in a parking lot.....after some practice you get some feel for the amount of action and reaction it takes in backing. A few cardboard boxes to outline a parking lot ""ramp"" may help.....try backing from a few slight angles as well as sometimes the vehicles in a parking area are where you would like to be when approaching..... Once you have the boat out of the water....pull ahead a fair distance to get out of the way of others putting in or taking out. Hook up the electric, put on the back strap or straps, disconnect the gas line from the motor, secure the motor.....check for anything in the boat that may blow out such as life jackets, etc. If you are going a distance and it may rain, take out the transom plug as it will drain as you go....  In addition, if you have bearing buddies....before leaving the house, take off the protective covers and push on the buddy with a screwdriver....if it tips or moves, you don't need grease. If it doesn't move, add just enough grease until it is moveable. If you overfill, it's very likely you can blow the inner seals. If this note isn't clear, talk to some folks who have the same type hubs.... If your hubs are ever warm when you get to the ramp, they need grease.   A couple of pointers that may help, (I learned these the hard way). When backing up the trailer, remember and take time to think of this, the trailer will move in the direction that the bottom of the steering wheel moves, ie if you want the trailer to go to the right move the bottom of the wheel to the right, if you think of it in this way it helps counter the natural desire to turn the wheel in the wrong direction. When taking the boat out of the water back the trailer only far enough in so that the tops of the fenders are barely above water, this will allow you to place boat on trailer without the boat floating and moving side to side while you are cranking unto trailer. The other thing to think about if you have more then one ramp and a dock running beside them it is better for a rookie to choose the side where the wind or current will push the boat to the dock, then away from it. Now a word for those in line behind a rookie, IT IS MUCH BETTER TO GET OUT AND LEND A HELPING HAND, then to stand and make snide remarks, it makes for better feelings, teaches lessons, and moves the line much faster. Hopes this helps, good luck Masterbaiter.   When launching with two people if the second one can drive the boat after stopping boat at waters edge have the second person get in the boat. Unhook the winch then back in until the boat floats off the trailer. Drive away leaving the second person to drive the boat. If the launch has more than one ramp they may be designated in & out. If this is the case obey the rules to avoid holding up others just because you preferred the other ramp. It is best while you are still not at the ramp yet to walk down and check the ramp and rules if any so you know what is expected of you & what you are likely to encounter. Also as mentioned eariler make sure your boat is fully loaded and prepared before you move to the ramp. On busy days tempers can get short when the ramp is tied up unneccesarly. If you can practicing at less busy times at first is a good idea. Also if you are having problems most will be happy a beginer if asked.   Don't take the boat through the Tim Horton's drive through...I made that mistake.  **************************"
