39959,Bernie,2007-02-25 22:58:00,3190,Nice pike... Sledgehammer handle!..How was the walleye fishing?
39968,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-25 23:36:00,2585,awesome report!  I hear Rob Hyatt is oneof the best for getting people into fish up there.  i was up in north bay for the weekend but unfortunatly i was not fishing.  i am hopeing to go back next weekend but think a bunch of us may hit a smaller lake in the area then nipissing.  Thanks for the report!  Nice pike!  CHeers!
