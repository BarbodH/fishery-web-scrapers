40003,Greencoachdog,2007-02-26 00:33:00,8163,Swindle should be banned from competition for life! I have a deep dislike for all tournement fishermen for exactly that kind of crap!!! It would send a message to the others to be courteous on the water.
40020,hawg_hauler,2007-02-26 01:05:00,69,"Please don't judge all tournament anglers based on a few bad apples. Boaters in general can be ignorant and careless whether they are pleasure boating, towing skiers, riding jet skis, tournament angling or just plain fishing. It only takes an individual engaged in any of these activities to make the wrong decision and cause the ""branding affect""."
