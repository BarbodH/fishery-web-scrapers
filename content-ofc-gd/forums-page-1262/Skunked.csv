I have been out here twice with a buddy of mine who said it was good fishing, of the two times we managed to pull out one small pike, my buddy keeps saying it will get better as it warms up, guess I will find out.  Any reviews of this spot??  Any other spots around sudbury that are good ice fishing, might try out towards the island a little more,"
