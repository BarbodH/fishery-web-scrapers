39355,mattyk,2007-02-24 11:07:00,2110,"There is a musky show going on in this area this weekend. So i took a little road trip with the wife. I picked me up a few goodies. But i think i spent my entire fishing allowance for several years, and my wife almost killed me when she found out how much i spent. She was ok with it after i explained to her why i needed another rod and reel. Anways, I picked a St Croix 7.6 M/H rod and Shimano Calcutta 400. Also a few spinner baits,bucktails, a jointed believer and a top raider.  "
39357,Roy,2007-02-24 11:14:00,13728,Nice haul Matt. You can't go wrong with any of those purchases...it's all quality stuff.
39360,silveradosheriff,2007-02-24 11:44:00,1025,"Nice stuff - I just tell the wife that I amoritize it over 20 years....sounds like a good investment then,"
39361,Rich Clemens,2007-02-24 11:51:00,3131,Basic necessities I'd say.
39371,mattyk,2007-02-24 12:44:00,2110,"I figured i would pick some of the bare essentials and i also explained to my wife that this stuff last for a lifetime. I told her how my other nice reels have lasted for well over 15 years, while the crappy stuff lasts a year or two and falls apart. She thought that was a good excuse.  But i think i will be working it off at home doing dishes, cooking food, etc."
39376,Roy,2007-02-24 13:25:00,13728,Not to mention the 'other stuff' you'll have to do. :-)
39444,Whopper,2007-02-24 17:47:00,2174,"Good stuff Matt!  Please tell me you didn't go to Columbus, I was headed there last evening and had a change of plans made for me.  Whopper"
39499,GbayGiant,2007-02-24 21:32:00,1780,"Very nice purchase, good luck with those dishes."
39544,Pigeontroller,2007-02-24 22:48:00,2793,Nice Combo!
39657,mattyk,2007-02-25 03:04:00,2110,i went to the columbus muskie show. They had some cool stuff there. This was my first time to an all muskie show and i really enjoyed it.
39800,JFR,2007-02-25 15:16:00,498,"Very nice combo, how many pairs of shoes does she own? that should stop any discussions in their tracks."
39937,mattyk,2007-02-25 21:23:00,2110,I've tried to use that argument before and I always loose.
39960,mepps,2007-02-25 22:59:00,1301,nice!!
40104,muskiesRus,2007-02-26 05:09:00,18,"When I die I just hope that my wife doesn't sell my Muskie stuff for what I ""SAID"" I paid for it!!!!"
40171,mattyk,2007-02-26 13:39:00,2110,"lol, muskieRus. I understand."
40560,lew,2007-02-27 09:36:00,12767,You made a good choice on the Premier / Calcutta combo Matt. They  work well together and you'll get alot of years of good service from them.  Some nice baits there too.
40563,Greencoachdog,2007-02-27 10:16:00,8163,I'll give you $5 for that jointed Believer right now Mat!
