40040,huntervasili,2007-02-26 01:35:00,1604,LOL... I am in man...
40043,Daplumma,2007-02-26 01:40:00,1961,I'll be right there Joe
40046,irishfield,2007-02-26 01:43:00,26272, But that's a good thing right now Bud...keep watching them!
40069,douG,2007-02-26 02:21:00,2693,"I appreciate that,  Wayne, it's therapeutic.  But what about the queasiness?"
40071,motv8tr,2007-02-26 02:26:00,2587,"Sorry I missed this, it's too late for me now, I'm back to work tomorrow so it's an early bed for me...  Maureen"
40072,Roy,2007-02-26 02:30:00,13728,I have no time but...ok.
40074,Spiel,2007-02-26 02:34:00,9065,"....I was there, but I had to leave...."
40207,cisco,2007-02-26 15:01:00,597,"I heard on the news that the celebs were not going to be driven in limos as usual, but were to be driven there in 20 or 30 alternative fuel vehicles in support of the environment.  Anyone have any links or anything to see these machines and get descriptions?  I missed the show (like... too bad. Har har!) but was hoping the commentators would spend a bit of time explaining each vehicle.  Nice for celebs to show support for fuel efficiency.... and let's forgive em when they get back to their mansions and go for a toot in one of their Hummers/helicoptors!"
40224,pikehunter,2007-02-26 16:00:00,1659,"I agree, can't stand them. They don't make me puke though because I just refuse to watch them. They just have too much of this  And they are just plane boring."
40228,Guest gbfisher,2007-02-26 16:15:00,0,20 women over last night.   Oscars who??..  ...
