Looking at booking a trip to Island Lake (Thistle Lake), part of the Temagami Waterway System and was wondering if anyone has been up this way to let me know how the fishing was..  We're heading up the last week in May for a few days so any help would be of great appreciation..  We're staying at Island Lake Camp..  Tiz"
