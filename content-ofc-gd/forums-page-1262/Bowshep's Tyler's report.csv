40140,bowshep,2007-02-26 12:27:00,378,First of all Motiv8tor GREAT JOB  . This was my first time meeting the gang from OFC and everyone was cooler than my right leg. l was anticipating a great day on the ice but the perch that set up that man trap in the ice got thier revenge. l would like all the people know that l was humbled in the way everyone looked after me (l owe someone a pair of socks) and that l am proud to be involved with OFC. Anytime you need my help l will do my best to do so. For all the people on the other teams you better Quit your jobs because that the only way your going to beat us.  HATE THE GAME NOT THE PLAYERS. PEACE. KEN
