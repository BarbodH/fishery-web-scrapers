39744,motv8tr,2007-02-25 12:50:00,2587,"Well yet another very successful day out at the park   .  The weather was amazing, allbeit a little on the chilly side when we first started out.  Managed to meet a few new people, and say hello again to those I've met before.  Things were a little disorganized early on, but the cooking crew and early arrivals were quick to get things sorted out and running smooth.  Thanks you guys, even if I did have to move my car, or rather have it moved 4-5 times in 30 minutes  .  I'm going to post the few pics I have in the order of my taking them...I hope.  I think they'll speak for themselves  Beg Chev and Lady Walleye arrive in style   Oops   To the rescue   Free at last   Making the plan   To eat eat first or not, that is the question   1928 Snow Machine   Winning Perch   Man of the hour   Unfortunately that is all the pictures I was able to take, it seems I was a little distracted the rest of the day  .  We had a good turn out with 66 people registered for fishing, and many others just looking for some tastey food...unless they just liked the cooks and needed an excuse to come back   If I remember correctly, last year we were able to raise a total of close to 3000.00, including the auction.  Yesterday the totals came to 528.96 for the food. 1860.00 for entry/donations 2388.96 Total for one great day of fishing  I can't tell you all how much this day means to Tyler's family, not sure there are words available.  I will save my thanks for another post."
39749,Big Cliff,2007-02-25 13:03:00,6899,"Well, that's about double what we did on the food last year and we've still got the auction to go, I've already got my sights set on an item so let the fun continue!  Well done Moe!!!!!"

39841,douG,2007-02-25 17:09:00,2693,"Thanks again to you Maureen, and to the volunteers, contributors, and participants too!  I enjoyed reading every one of the reports with more than a little envy.  PatB ( aka Jack Daniels ) just dropped off my prize ( !?!) at my place, a helluva great guy.  Thanks, Pat."

39844,just herb,2007-02-25 17:14:00,7,"Maureen, I am really sorry I couldn't make it on Sat., but a visit from my daughter and grandkids quickly changed my plans. Next year I'll be there come hell or high water.  From the posts I've seen and talking to Cliff it sounds like it was a great and successful day. Kudos to you and all your helpers, donators, fisher people and eaters that made the day turn out as well as it did.  Herb"

40350,Ron,2007-02-26 21:29:00,1683,"Well that about sums it up in a nut shell!  I/we had a great time at the Fishing for Tyler. The food was great, hats off to the cooking gooroos Kelvin, JR and Big Cliff. If anyone is interested in a smoker, you have got to talk to JR. That did a fantastic job keeping everything piping hot. Maureen, another gang buster day, I'm glad you put the effort to organize such an event. Public awareness for Autism and especially raising money for one particular child that has fallen through the cracks is enough of an incentive all on itself. My hats off to you.  It was nice to see the turnout to support a person in need. For everyone who took the time and effort, I thank you. This is not only for the volunteers who helped set up and organize everything, this also goes to the fine fisher people who made the effort to help support such a fine worthy cause.  My daughter was ecstatic to have won first place, when she entered her fish, the first thing she wanted to do was to go see the prize table. Stephanie was envisioning everything she could pick, not expecting to be the first to choose! When her name was called for the ""Grand Prize Winner"", it didn't take her long to grab up the fishing rod combo! Any more rods, and Steph will have just as many as her Dad! LOL The other highlight for her was to see her smiling face on the A channel.  Once again, I would like to give thanks to Motv8r for setting up such a great event."
