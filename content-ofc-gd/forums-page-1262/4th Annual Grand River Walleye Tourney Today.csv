39963,Jen,2007-02-25 23:20:00,833," What a beautiful day!   Steve, Sonny, and Fred   Sonny   Raffle Prizes to raise Money For Sick Kids  We started the day at 5:30 am at Timmys of course... then off to Fishmaster Bait and tackle to pick up the rental hut and minnows... on the ice by 6:45.  In time to see the sun rise... absolutely gorgeous of course.  Kick off was at 7:00am, after trying for quiet some time to put our own holes in the ice, (cousin needs to sharpen the blades on his auger), Fishmaster was kind enough to come out with his power auger and get us set up.  I would guess there were between 50-80 ppl at this tournament, scattered from the dam to the mouth of the river.  Early morning a 4+ pound walleye was weighed in and then only two other fish the entire day plus one crappie.  All in all even though we didn't catch anything, my brother (Sonny) cousin and I all had an awesome day.  After being on the ice the warmth found at the Dunnville Hunter and Anglers Club was much enjoyed as was the excellent company and good times.  Sonny managed to walk away with the raffle prizes his heart desired. Even though there were no fish caught we all truly enjoyed our day.  Kudos to Fishmaster for putting on an excellent event! Thanks for all the help today!  Nice meeting everyone  Cheers, Jen"
