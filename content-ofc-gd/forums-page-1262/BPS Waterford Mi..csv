40312,muskiebobsr,2007-02-26 20:24:00,49,This is the start of their 10 day Spring Classic.  Lots and Lots of sales.  And our own Pete Mania is doing a workshop there this Saturday.  I believe at 12 until 3 PM.
40334,Bob Devine,2007-02-26 20:45:00,251,"Bob, I will be there next wknd, headed to Lansing for the MMA banquet Sat.  For those interested many know the great sales Bass Pro has on during their 10 day Spring Classic. It is only 3 hrs west of Toronto to Windsor and from Windsor another 35 minutes once you cross the tunnel. Many say that the price of equipment is cheaper in the USA with a better selection. Now is the chance to check it out. As Bob Sr said seminars from some great anglers. If you can make it I am sure you will enjoy it.  The wknd of Mar 9 10 11 there will be product reps from many of the big names in the fishing world. You can check the Bass Pro website for who is going to be there and what seminars would interest you, Some sales will NOT be listed but they do have ""BLUE"" light (not beer) specials during this great event.  Hope to see a few there the wknd of Mar 9-11."

40396,Krisco,2007-02-26 23:18:00,67,"I have been going to the sale the last few years and there are some great deals to be had on unadvertised items.  Bob, I will stop by your table on Sunday morning to say Hi.  Mike, if you get a chance try to slip over, might be quicker for you to go through Port Huron if you are coming from Chatham.  I believe Pete posted the other day that his seminar times had changed, might want to check 1st.  I hope I get a happy customs officer on the way home this time!!"
