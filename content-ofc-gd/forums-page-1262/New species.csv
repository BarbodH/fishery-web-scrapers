40644,ryanheritage,2007-02-27 15:07:00,180,So what you think? A bad boy tipped with minnow? or a spreader? lol .....It's great that there are still new species being found but at the expense of our ice shelfs ??? it's a bit scary to me. Has anyone seen the movie by Al Gore called an inconvienent truth? great movie but a little scary. Really cool fish though.
