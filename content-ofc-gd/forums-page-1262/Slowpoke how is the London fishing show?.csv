39603,taper,2007-02-25 01:13:00,611,I thought it was a pretty good show this year.
39659,steveharris,2007-02-25 03:07:00,7,"I was there on Friday, and thought it was pretty good.  Compared to the Toronto shows (pay for parking, traffic, bigger crowds), I liked the slightly scaled back version in London.   Excellent selection of boats, and the tackle section was good too.  Didn't really see any killer deals, but did pick up a new Quantum one piece rod.  Itchin' to try it in spring . ."
39670,SlowPoke,2007-02-25 03:36:00,2984,It was good Mike. Lots of boats to drual on. There seemed to be some nice boat deals. Tackle deals were okay. JB's had a huge selection of muskie baits and rods. Tightlines had a more varied selection and good prices. Angling Outfitters had a nice setup and I spoke with a Shimano rep/pro and she was terrific. I may go back tomorrow and pick up a Convergance Muskie Rod ($50) for my Corsair reel which would free up my St. Croix for either a Curado 300 ($249) or Calcutta 400 ($289). I walked out of the show with a Helly Hansen Delta suit and they threw in 5 spinner baits.  If you're coming in for the show tomorrow stop by my place on the way in. (check your PM's) -Brian
39673,Garyv,2007-02-25 03:47:00,547,"Although I'm suppose to be working a booth tomorrow ( Sunday ) with the potential bad weather forecast I decided to go today just in case we can't make it in the AM.  Overall I thought this was one of the better London shows in years.  lot's of tackle dealers and some better than average deals.  Boats....there were some nice displays and some really good deals if your ready to purchase.  I'm now in Love with a Lund and a Legend but not ready to divorce my wife to get either.  There were the usual what I consider side bar booths with different products, like Jerky, maps, boat repair etc and finally a fair amount of fishing lodges to talk to.  I spent a lot of time with Serge and Kelly Marin of Elk Cabins in Elk Lake.  They, along with Rene and Jean Pelliser ( Kelly's parents ) are very old friends of mine that unfortunately I don't get to see very often.  If you have the time Sunday take the trip and look around. It will be a lot nicer inside looking, and possibly spending some dollars, then playing outside in the winter storm that's forecast."
39706,jjcanoe,2007-02-25 04:57:00,744,"1st time I've been in about 6 years and I was pleasantly suprized with the amount of fishing stuff at the show compared to the lack of at previous shows years ago.  Good to see you Slowpoke and thanks again for the tickets, I owe you a fishing trip this summer.  Glad to hear you got your floater suit finally!  My son was happy as a pig in poop about the grab bag he got ($10 and he got about $30 worth of stuff!) I used to love buying those when I was a kid! You never knew what kind of treasure you were going to find inside.  jjcanoe"
39717,SlowPoke,2007-02-25 05:57:00,2984,"Hey John, You don't owe me anything for the passes... they were given to me! Good things happen to good people... the guy that gave them to me just won the FM96 Block Party... $500 cash and a 1 in 9 chance to win $10,000!! That's not to say we can't hook-up for some fishing but ya don't owe me a trip LOL!! Glad to hear LJ (Little John) got a good grab bag. I was thinking of picking up a couple for my daughters but I had flashback.... digging into a grab bag when I was a kid only to pull out a cheap red and white bobber, a yellow plastic practice casting weight and three cheesy rubber worms melted together! I might go back tomorrow and pick up a couple. Besides, I owe my girls some candy floss... I was outta cash, they didn't take debit and there isn't an ATM in there. I wasn't about to go to the casino to hit an ATM or I'd still be there!!  I wonder if this goof suit will really float with my fat-donkey stuffed into it! "
39733,ChrisK,2007-02-25 11:40:00,2772,"Yup,show was good this year...Lots of fishing booths and good turn out in the outfitters and lodge section...The boat room was packed as well so all in all I would say London is starting to come back again just like the old days.... JB's was even there so I was even able to pick me up a few muskie baits  Cheers !!"
39761,Handlebarz,2007-02-25 13:33:00,3790,well its raining here right now so I will be parking my butt inside today I will be playing on the crappie roads tonight. This is the first time in years that I did not make one show I guess this weekend was busted as it was my daughters B-day so I could not go yesterday. Oh well there is next year.
40077,Deg,2007-02-26 02:55:00,51,"Sorry we missed seeing you at the show Gary. Like you, we decided that Saturday looked like a better day to travel to London. Got there at ten and the parking lot was already crowded. Like others have said  the show seems to have gotten better each year. I bet there were more people on Saturday afternoon than we saw at the Toronto show on Thursday. We met Gman and Boston on the way in and did some catching up. Was nice seeing Gavin again.  As usual I didn't buy anything if you don't count the two Spin Doctors, the 6 Shurstrike flies, and a number of lures. Ruth knows this is nothing compared to the $750.00 reel I put back on the counter. lol  Catch you next time."
40226,fishless,2007-02-26 16:09:00,82,"hello all i was there sunday i thought the show was the best in years. i didn,t reach into my pocket but there was lots to buy.jamie"
40237,SlowPoke,2007-02-26 16:39:00,2984,"There seems to be a consensous that the London Show was was great...  The Pro's $9 adult entry, $2 for kids Free Parking Lots of Boats Lots of Tackle Lots of Resorts Some good deals  The Con's It's only once a year"
