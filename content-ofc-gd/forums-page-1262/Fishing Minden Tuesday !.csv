We ussually stick to simcoe for whities and lakers but this time we have decided to go a little more north and give minden area lakes a try.  Can anyone recommend a lake with decent lake trout fishing ? methods of success ?  We were thinking Gull,Mountain,12 mile,boshkung...  PM or post would be great !"

40254,Hooked,2007-02-26 17:31:00,891,"The lakes you mentioned are goods ones to pick from.  Personally, I would try Boshkung.  If memory serves me correctly, theres a parking lot right off the hiway where Halls Lake meets it."
40273,glen,2007-02-26 18:25:00,2641,There is a slot size on some of those lakes.  Good luck.
40385,woodro,2007-02-26 23:00:00,168,"all good, make sure the sonar is charged up, it'll definately help you guys. look for structure anywhere in 25-50ft and i garauntee action. rock shouls and rocks piles are key"
40402,jeffw,2007-02-26 23:29:00,267,"I'd give mountain a try but you will get fish in gull there is just alot more pressure on gull.If you are going through norland I would get large minnows there and use a swivel, couple foot long flourocarbon leader, split shot and a good sharp baitholder hook. If you don't have a sonar then I would just bring the minnows a few feet off bottom. Montain also has whitefish. Cheers Jeff"
40488,mukluk,2007-02-27 02:26:00,196,Mountain Lake is a good bet; fish out and around Wintergreen Island for laketrout and whitefish.  45-60ft. water. There is a slot size on the lake for lakers but not whitefish.
