Not only for Tyler, but providing such a great day for so many great people.    The first two pictures say it all.  They were taken seconds apart and only yards apart. The Innisfil Winterfest.   The Fishing for Tyler Event.   The fabulous crew that put on such a great feed.   I had met Loonietoon and JR before.  It was especially a pleasure finally meeting Cliff.  What a class individual. These guys worked steady all morning getting all the grub ready.  They've really got it down pat.  JR's smoker worked out awesome.  The infamous Clampett finally revealed along with Miss Hathaway!   I took a pile of other photos, but most of them have been duplicated in other threads.  Suffice to say that it was a real treat seeing all those that I've met before and great to meet so many new folks. OFNers really are a special group of people."

I'm still wondering what brain surgeon decided the midway should have gone where they set it up     Lets hope next year they have it on another weekend or use a different parking lot.  And I have to agree, the chef's were fantastic.  Wonderful job done!!!  Joey"
