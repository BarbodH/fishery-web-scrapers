40272,wuchikubo,2007-02-26 18:24:00,1114,Congrats on the huge laker!
39893,wallacio,2007-02-25 19:58:00,475,"Two buddies caught this monster on Saturday just before we arrived. It took a spreader on bottom and though hard to believe, came up through a 6'' hole (only by sticking a bare arm down the hole and grabbing it by the jaw). Unfortunately the old boy's gills were shredded and he didn't make it to swim another day.   "
39894,Joey,2007-02-25 20:01:00,9122,"Holy Crap, that's from Simcoe.  Whew, that's a biggun!  Congrats.  Joey"
39895,mattyk,2007-02-25 20:02:00,2110,"wow, hard to believe that's from simcoe. Looks like one of those beasts from Great Bear Lake in the NWT."
39897,Clampet,2007-02-25 20:05:00,1947,"Mr Big meets his match, and fitted through a six inch hole...eeeedoggies!"
39899,Mike the Pike,2007-02-25 20:10:00,3421,Hey Jed thats the fish that tired you out last week .Bigger and wider augers are the way to .Thanks for landing Paul's fish  Nice laker.MTP
39900,lilkynan,2007-02-25 20:12:00,173,Pulled a lot of boots from Lake O that size - then this fall we moved to Barrie - thanks for the inspiration to fish Lake Simcoe - my new home
39901,solopaddler,2007-02-25 20:15:00,8605,Nice fish Davey!
39903,spoonman,2007-02-25 20:16:00,103,"That is a monster Laker for Simcoe, Looks like it would easily make 18-20lbs it is a shame that it did not make it back alive. That is the problem when fishing in a 6inch hole. Congratulations and did you get an official weight on it."
39909,wallacio,2007-02-25 20:29:00,475,"The size of the hole had nothing to do with the demise of that fish.  It basically inhaled the spreader and the multiple hooks did the damage to it's gill rakers.   It was unfortunate that it didn't make it back...for what it's worth, it was a stocker (Adipose and Ventral clip).   We didn't get an official weight on it but we guessed 15lbs or so."
39910,Joey,2007-02-25 20:32:00,9122,Well just go get the package out of the garbage that you got it in from Loblaws and it should show the weight  Kidding bud!  Joey
39929,glen,2007-02-25 21:00:00,2641,Nice fish.
39933,steverowbotham,2007-02-25 21:18:00,1800,"beauty fish man, would have been nice to get her back, but nothing you could do about it.  How deep were you fishin ?"
39935,Bassman27,2007-02-25 21:20:00,98,Thats awesome  Bassman
39943,Master of Bait,2007-02-25 21:44:00,196,HOLY MOTHER OF LAKE TROUT!  Must've been the one that got away from Clampet....  Nice to see there some beauts like that roaming the depths of Simcoe.  I think I'm now convinced that I need to progress from perch next year...
39946,Basspro,2007-02-25 22:02:00,11,..and through a 6 inch hole!!  Yikes.  Nice fish!
39957,fishindevil,2007-02-25 22:50:00,6254,now thats what im talking about.....   nice grampa lake trout   congrats   cheers
39961,wallacio,2007-02-25 23:03:00,475,"Steverowbotham,  It was taken in approx 45 FOW.   We were fishing for whities in the midst of a huge ball of smelt.  That big old laker must have been snacking on the school of smelt."
40005,irishfield,2007-02-26 00:42:00,26272,What a beast !
40019,GbayGiant,2007-02-26 01:03:00,1780,B-E-A-U- ty.
40035,Spiel,2007-02-26 01:28:00,9065,....It's a beauty for sure. But I'm surprised at those that think it's unusual for Simcoe? That size is not as rare as you might think.
40084,Rizzo,2007-02-26 03:19:00,4754,man oh man that's a beauty
40114,musky66,2007-02-26 06:59:00,273,"Yep, I pulled a 15 lber from Sincoe a few years back...same thing- 50' of water with a spreader at Roches point. Also have caught perch and decent Pike at that depth on minnows and a three-way."
40168,ccmtcanada,2007-02-26 13:33:00,7971,Wow...what a monster!! Congrats!
40233,Tacklebuster,2007-02-26 16:32:00,303,"nice fish, can hear the dinner bell ringing right about now.  And yes, I have to agree with Speil, that size laker allbeit its a nice size, but not that unusual."
40239,lovetofish,2007-02-26 16:44:00,500,"Wow, beautiful laker! Congratulations!"
