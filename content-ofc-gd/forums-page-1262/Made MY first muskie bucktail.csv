So I have been watching WFN all weekend  Anyway my Dad has been making bucktails since New Years and i would help him a bit with a few of them here and there...  But since I was kind of bored I decided to make one of my own and surprise him when he gets home.  It is not as good as the ones my dad makes but i still like it.  I liked the powder painting part alot and also had fun with the rest. I think that the hardest parts for me were choosing which colour beads to use  and also the loop    I have no idea how you guys bend the thick shafts   Anyway here it is...          Thanks for reading, Corey"
