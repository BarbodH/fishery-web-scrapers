40540,tip-up,2007-02-27 04:48:00,94,"Could not have asked for a better day. It's nice to be able to fish without the heater hissing on blast like on colder days. Weather was sunny and warm. The perfect day on the ice. Fishing was hot yet again! Had planned to get out for walleye early this morning but to our luck, the bait shop did not open till 9:30am..go figure. It was 7am when we arrived. Crappie were biting good last weekend so we decided to give it another go today. Glad we did.  Set up at 7:30am and fished with small plastics until the baitshop opened for pinheads. Bite turned on just as the sun had risen' over the tree tops. For the early part of the morning I could not seem to keep 'em on the hook. Anthony was using a bigger size hook and was getting a lot more hookups than me. Moved around a bit and took a small number of fish from each hole...Lots of dinks. We also set a few tip-ups for roaming pike. No flag popping today though. Tried making a few videos with the old camera...    Joco showed up bit later on in the morning and started punching a few holes around the area..His tip-up was in no more than 10 minutes and he lands this nice 32'' pike.Two weeks to late for the derby. We continued catching crappie and bluegill averaging 5''-12''. Anthony had to leave later on in the morning for work so I got him to bring the gist of the gear back to the house. Marco and I stayed a few hours later. Thanks for the jigs bud. No doubt I will have to add a few more to the arsenal.  Joco with a nice pike!   He also kept a few slab crappie for himself..   Left alone with only a few jigs and rods..I now wonder why I drag over 100 pounds of gear on the ice with me every outing..   The crappie and bluegill were bitting on small jigs tipped with a small CJ&S plastic tail and spoons/pinhead minnows. Pink, red and blue was the key today. Bigger slabs were cruising the the 10' in the water column over 13'. Bluegills remained glued to the bottom. It was definitely the nicest day on the ice thisyear weather wise, and I think Joco's best day of the season fishing wise. Easily over 100+ fish caught today between the 3 of us. This weekend coming up will be the hunt for big perch in Quebec..I already have a few spots in mind.  Couple of 11'' crappie   Concentrating..   My small snack..I rarely even keep that many..Just enough to feed myself.   Thanks for reading  -Andrew"
