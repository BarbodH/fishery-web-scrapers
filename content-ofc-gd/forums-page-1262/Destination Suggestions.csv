Would also like to spend a week in the general area (S.S.Marie north (west)on our own as a family . Don't think there is a bad lake just looking for any reccomendations/good experiences  Looking to either rent a  cottage or camp (tent).Lodges are a bit out of our price range (5 people) Prefer a larger lake as we will haul or own boat (17' 90hp) also willing to travel short distances from base camp for day trips species focus Pike ,walleye,even bass !  Have been thinking Lake Nipegon area.  Any and all comments appreciated.  And I promise lots of pics!  Tinbanger"
40606,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-27 13:28:00,957,"Lac Seul is a great Lake just a short drive north of Dryden.  Buy a good map of the area and take it with you to the only Dairy Queen in Dryden.  Louise, manager at DQ, will show you how to drive to a boat launching site and might give you some tips on where/how to find huge walleyes.  Lac Seul also holds muskies and pike, but it's a super walleye fishery.  Enjoy your meal at DQ and good luck fishing.  I doubt you'll find a better lake to fit your travel plans."
40620,trapshooter,2007-02-27 13:58:00,1234,"Hey tinbanger,  Lac Seul is a great lake and is only about an hr North of Dryden up the logging road.  I have guided there for the past 2 summers and can help you out.  There is an excellent crown land campground and boat launch on a part of lac seul called Williams lake.  From there you can easily access Lac Seul proper by boat, but there is good fishing in Williams too, esp. for pike.  You won't find any muskies in South Central Lac Seul.  You have to fish the eastern end of the lake out of Sioux Lookout for ski's.  Like Tennessee guy said, Lac Seul is a walleye Factory!  Fish windblown shorelines and points and work to find the most productive depth, which will largely depend on what time of the summer you are there.  By mid july they are in 25 feet and deeper for the most part.  Jig and minnow is all you need to catch them.  Lac Seul is also full of huge sand structures with steep breaks to deeper water.  These hold walleye as well and are best fished with bottom bouncers and spinners with a worm or minnow.  If you have any other questions I'd be happy to help you out.   Let me know when you're planning on going and I can help you out with the fishing more if I know that.  Definitely get a map though, Lac Seul is huge and is filled with Islands and miles of irregular shoreline.  Very easy to get lost out there.  Cheers, ben."

40634,tinbanger,2007-02-27 14:31:00,1028,Wow  Thanks for the info guys . Let me do a bit of searching  Again really appreciate your insight. btw expect to be there end of July early Aug  Ben expect a PM !  TB
40636,trapshooter,2007-02-27 14:43:00,1234,"You bet TB, I'll be happy to help you out.  End of July eh... you'll definitely want to focus on 25-35 feet of water by that time of the year.  That's the biggest mistake people make up there is that they fish too shallow in the dead of summer and complain b/c they only catch small ones.  Pack lots of 1/2 and 5/8 oz jigs for that depth.  Gotta run.  Talk to you later.  Cheers, ben."
