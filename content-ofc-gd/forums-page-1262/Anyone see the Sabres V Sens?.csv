39289,spanky,2007-02-24 03:28:00,195,"someone, just anyone, explain to me how you could not see this happening? ... the announcers saw it coming, i saw it coming, the fans saw it coming, heck even my wife saw it coming- all right after the hit.... Murray was the only one who didn't see it happening, Heatley started the cross checking before they even got set for the face-off. A guy from the AHL, ""skill"" player not a goon, went toe to toe with Neil and he had no problem with the beat down of a ""skilled"" player (re: non-""goon"")... if i was Muckler i'd be ticked at Murray for being the only one on the planet that was clueless about what was going to happen...  BTW-  there wasn't really an fights, apart from the initial Spezza fight and then someone jumped on the sabres players back... then the 2 Emery fights (I hear he's an amateur boxer, so i am willing to say he'd be up for a fight with anyone in the league), mostly just dropped gloves and played ""ring-around-the-goalie""... totally blown out of proportion, but i still don't get the whole ""well, our goon just dropped their captain with a debatable hit, let's put the #1 line out there i think it's all over with now...."" thought... can't find a logical reason other then for the Sens to say ""ahh, look at that, their enforcers jumped our skilled guys... they should be suspended, i'm appalled, i could have never imagined this happening""  And for as much flack as Peter's takes, yes he does do some stupid over the line stuff, but for the abuse he takes he shoulda just kept laying the beats on McGratton when he broke his cheek last year, instead of calling in the refs when he saw he was hurt... just so he would be rightfully abused"
39291,bigfish1965,2007-02-24 03:36:00,3382,Murray should have known it was going to happen and called a time-out. This gives him the right to another line change.  Even in the fights there are unwritten rules. No upper cuts and no shots to the mouth. The hit was cheap and the response was predictable. Ruff did as she should have. Murray was dumb for leaving that line out. Ruff has taken a bunch of no-names and made them stars. He must be doing something right. He's like the anti-Quinn.
39317,SlowPoke,2007-02-24 06:09:00,2984,They bought into his system so they didn't have to listen to him whine.
39345,Smokey,2007-02-24 09:42:00,1278,First thing I thought as well Rick. Time out and change the line but who did he have to put on tougher then the guys all ready out there.
39348,Mattitude,2007-02-24 10:28:00,155,2006 Jack Adams Award (Coach of the Year) went to Lindy Ruff.  Maybe he was a little angry at the time but I doubt there are many coaches that would not have done the same thing.  I used to hate Buffalo but it's hard to ignore a talented team.
39358,gaffer,2007-02-24 11:31:00,12,should be in for a doozie on saturday.

39396,lookinforwalleye,2007-02-24 14:17:00,4399,"First of all when it comes to the coaches Murray imho is one of the biggest goon coaches going he has a history of this sorta of thing and Ruff is just a whiner period althought i can`t blame him in this case. Everybody should know what Chris Neil is about by now yes he does have more skill than the typical headhunting goon but he is imho a cheap shot artist first and foremost he looks for opportunities to INJURE players and that my friends makes him a punk. The hit was late if he wanted too he could have decide not to hit Drury,Drury was totaly defenseless and the hit was from the blind side a Chris Neil trademark. When a player takes the opporunity to hit another player to the head blind and potentially seriously injure or end a career then i have no respect for that player and the NHL does not need that type in the league,don`t get me wrong i don`t mind a good scrap every now and then but the intent to injure has to taken out of the game for good,Chris Neil should be suspended for intent to injure. These things will continue to happen until the NHL get serious about protecting players from headshots."

40208,blaque,2007-02-26 15:04:00,2419,"Sorry Guys, How soon Mr. Murray forgets lol  Watch the link for those of you who havent seen this, it sheds some light on Bryan Murrays' Halo......not only does he dispatch goon like mentality, but he singles out goaltenders lol.  "
38955,blaque,2007-02-23 17:53:00,2419,"Want an honest opinion from a Diehard Sabres fan? The hit, Ruff was ridiculous to say that it was an elbow......Ill admit that. But like some feel in this thread, it didnt matter wether he elbowed or not.........that wasnt the issue i had with the hit at all......it was the fact (and ive watched the replay several times) that Neil saw drury shoot the puck, and as the puck left the stick, he changed direction and headed directly for Drury, and as someone said ""Blindsided"" him. Knowing he was in a vulnerable , defenseless position. Thats as cheap as it gets. Alot are saying......no elbow and Drury didnt even get injured by neil, he hit his head on the ice. LOL.........YEAH, because NEIL put him on the ice.?!?!?!  Sorry, i have no remorse for a hit from the side of a player, behind, anywhere where a player is unable to defend himself or avoid the hit. And yes, that includes open ice hits when a guys heads down. And yes that includes the Campbell Umberger hit. (just to show im not one for double standards lol) Yeah they are legal hits, but , i dunno, lets use the word disrespectful. Its disrespectful to try and end someones career who spent there whole lives trying to make it into this league. Anyway, Im tangenting. The hit was classless, i lbelieve that term was used many times in this thread to describe Buffalos actions......or at least Ruff...but lest we forget that it all started from an Ottowa player hitting a star forward in a cheap fashion.  I dunno, ill give ottowa the fact that it wasnt an elbow, and I will also say that id rather see someone find neil the next shift and take care of him personally instead of going eye for an eye with the wingers . But i will also say that i LOVE a good brawl on the ice LOL!!! Ill also ay that i thought Peters move was assanine grabbing a goaltender like that, clearly Emery didnt want anything to do with pummeling Biron. Hes done some stupid things. The golf swing on the ice last year during the playoffs aimed at the losing opponent was amongst one of his stupider moves lol."
38966,troutologist,2007-02-23 18:15:00,951,Now thats hockey. What a bushleague move by Ruff sending out the toughguys to go after the #1 line for the sens. Emer might be one of the most underrated tough guys in the league I saw him do the asme thing many times in the OHL. I hope CBC bumps the leaf game on saturday so we can see a rematch.
38977,fishforfun,2007-02-23 18:33:00,105,"Well I have 30+ yrs teaching in minor hockey and this year minor hockey adopted the same rules emphasis that the NHL embraced 2 yrs ago. The DVD's I was given to explain the new rules emphasis were produced by the NHL. The rule is you can only finish the check if you are within a stick length of the player period.  As already pointed out he changed direction to make the hit and he was a good 3 to 4 stick lengths away = dirty hit elbow or not, and he isn't protesting the call. Now will the NHL add games who knows? Problem is a few thousand 14 and 15 yr olds watched this hit and the subsequent brawls etc. gonna be a long weekend for me as a convenor. My biggest prob with it all, watch the tape of the 2 coaches arguing and note the young kids standing behind the glass. disgusting!"
38994,Northhunter,2007-02-23 19:03:00,214,"Hahaha... CBC bump the Leafs game??!! The CBC are leaf homers. They're a national channel and publicly funded, but Toronto is the coast to coast game every Saturday. Not gonna happen.  But on to the hit.. Ruff may be a whiner (I agree with the poster who said Quinn was worse), but seeing that hit as it happened, from the bench, behind the play it probably did look like an elbow. If you were the coach what would you have done? Tight playoff race, division rival, you already have injury problems and one of your top players gets taken out (and from your vantage point it looks like a late cheap shot to the head)... ""Oh, well. Hey big tough guys who's job it is to enforce, intimidate, protect and generally be a physical presence on the ice.. hit the showers. We'll get'em next game.""     Yeah right!!!"
39003,Puckhead,2007-02-23 19:39:00,377,"Neil's an idiot. It was ""clean"" technically but he raised his shoulder to pop him in the head.  He could have kept his shoulder down and it wouldn't have killed the guy.  One of these days, Neil is going to get what's coming to him.  Intent to injure, irregardless of whether the hit was clean or not is more how I look at it.  And bottom line, Neil was intending to knock him out.  Good on Ruff for sending the tough guys out there.  You want to play that way, send a message.  That's what hockey has been missing.  Too many of these intent to injure shots go un punished because it's ""clean"", so you have to take care if it yourself.  Peters was an idiot for fighting Emery.  That shouldn't have happened."
39054,Northhunter,2007-02-23 21:06:00,214," Exactly. That's the reason it looks like the instigator rule will be revised for next season.  Everyone was all over it when Koivu got nailed a few games ago. The hit was ""legal"" but he was totally blindsided. Souray (not a goon or a pylon by any means) dropped the gloves to take care of business and got ejected. Every hockey talk radio program was discussing whether or not Souray did the ""right thing"" the next day, but if nobody stepped up, what would that show other teams? What does that say for team character? If your captain gets nailed on a questionable hit and nobody takes action, you have no team, IMO."
39061,blaque,2007-02-23 21:10:00,2419,"I hear ya fish for fun, i got a nephew that im real close playin Mite Hockey and its a tough call when im watchin a game with him and have to pretend Im not all fired up and lovin a scene like last night in Buffalo LOL!! I just tell him when he grows up and makes it in the league, to emulate guys like Briere who are sitting on the bench watching the fisticuffs lol. Seriously though, i totally get your point of view, its funny what we as adults are allowed to enjoy, but would never want our kids (or nephews) taking part in or rooting for.  I dont think youll see much tomorrow night either. I think the coaches have calmed down and will probably instruct to walk away and try and draw stupid penalties to win the game. I also bet Drury is out of the line-up for saturday wether hes able to go or not, just to enhance the possibility of the League punishing Neil. (and im not sayin hes not hurt by the way)"
39104,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-23 21:47:00,2050,That fight made my day! I miss those days of hockey!  UF
39151,brifishrgy,2007-02-23 23:00:00,559,Ruff should get suspended for a few games at the least ... the hit was clean and for a coach to send his goons out the next shift to fight the skill players is completely unacceptable ... send your tough guy out against another tough guy ... I hope the Sens kick the sabres $#$&$^   on Sat ..
39208,silveradosheriff,2007-02-24 00:52:00,1025,Ruff is a cancer on the league.
39216,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-24 01:07:00,2585,as a former goalie that used to like the fighting I thought it was awesome.  Its rare to see a tough guy and a goalie go at it.  The chest protector on emery sure does slow the punches down.  I used to pull my arm out so i could throw punches better and faster to make it a little more even.  As for the hit it was late for sure but it was a shoulder and he was lining him up before he got rid of the puck so it could be argued either way i guess.  I dont really care for lindy but i blame murry for putting on his skilled players.  how could you?  he should have been expecting it!!!!!!  Good old time hockey though loved watching it!  Cheers!
39240,bucktail,2007-02-24 01:38:00,1857,Northhunter is right!!!!!!!!!!!!  Bump the Maple Losers and carry this game tomorrow night CBC...it will be great!
39267,silveradosheriff,2007-02-24 02:21:00,1025,"Ruff had last change. If he had an ounce of class, he should have waited for the Ottawa role players and then put the meatheads out.  Q: What kind of a tough guy targets the skilled players for a fight? A: One coached by Lindy Ruff"
