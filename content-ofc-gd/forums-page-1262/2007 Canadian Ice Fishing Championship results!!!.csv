40434,trapshooter,2007-02-27 00:17:00,1234,"Don,  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  Don (IceGuyD) sponsored Derek (icewalker28) and myself for the CIFC's this past weekend.  Don provided us with Sleds, Fish Traps, Vex's, Auger, tackle, knowledge and above all else a lot of laughs and a great expereince at the tournament.  We were thrilled with 13th place and can't wait for next year.  They ran a really great tournament and I'd recommend fishing it to anyone.  Yeah Smokey, Derek will love life at the Lodge this summer.  Great place to work at and lots of fishin too.  I usually get a mid summer and end of season report up.  Cheers, Ben."
