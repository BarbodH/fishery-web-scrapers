Well headed out to Alexandria Ontario for the 5th annual Alexandria Fishing Derby with two friends Glen and Danny.  This was the fourth year I attended the last two years I was skunked and today I caught a little Dink(Pike) 1.46lbs not good enough to qualify for any prizes.  In all today there were 1073 participants with 273 pike brought in to be weighed at the weigh in station.There were 56 prizes for the heaviest fish.  56th place was a pike that weighed 1.87lbs and 1st place was  a pike that weighed 4.38lbs.Not bad for a little Lake 1km by 400m wide in the middle of downtown Alexandria.Enough said on with the pics.   The usual stop TIM HORTONS downtown Alexandria  Glen and Danny waiting in line to pick our spot on the ice at 9am.  The long line that we have to endure.  OH YA THE PRIZES  More of the good stuff.  More goodies.  Ok I finally have to show you the little dink I caught yes I had to weigh the litlle dill pickle.(1.46lbs) Sorry no ruler for this guy I had to hurry to the weigh station and besides you would all probably compare this twirp to a Simcoe Perch.Joey please try not to laugh too much.     OK BITE ME (BITE YOUR LIP I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE YELLOW SURVIVAL SUIT.  More prizes.  1st prize a Honda ATV 500,2nd prize a Honda ATV 400,one 8hp Honda outboard.2 Honda generators.    Here is the sign my 10 year old daughter made for me just in case I got something bigger than a simcoe perch  After the end of the tournament some people soaking it all up.  The end of the day waiting to see if I am going to win something with the dink Danny ,Me (MTP)and Glen.  That was our day we wil try again next year.MTP"
