260659,modny,2008-10-22 14:08:00,502,haha what the heck  i was at the lower damn last sunday  managed 1 eye about 3 lbs. thinking about fishing the upper part just above the dam for those moving fish
260662,highdrifter,2008-10-22 14:34:00,2534,Still fishing the grand huh?  Must be geographical proximity..  Adapt and overcome...  Guess it ain't that shabby!  HD

260850,Fishmaster,2008-10-23 02:18:00,920,Below the dam is way better this time of year ...1/4 and 1/2 oz jig heads with Yum and Power Bait Twisters tipped with a Large Shinner work very well all Fall...then once Ice up it gets even better ...i have a Tourney running Novemeber 1st on the Lower Grand 5th year now and allways lots of fish weighed in ....
