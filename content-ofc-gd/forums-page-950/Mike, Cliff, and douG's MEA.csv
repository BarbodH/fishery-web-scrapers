261147,kemper,2008-10-24 13:58:00,2232,will somebody PLEASE post this report.  haha i have a feeling were in for an EPIC OFC.  Whenever a report takes this long it usually includes many many pictures (good ones) and some serious pen work by either moosebunk or Solo. In this case its solo and a whole lot of trout.   ...and you guys didnt stop by my rez on the way because??????  damn midterms.
