219835,Stoty,2008-06-26 14:26:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  Since my boat is at the cottage, I dont have a way of checking if Sand Lake (just north of Kingston) is on my chip. If its not, is there anyway to download it?  I have a Lowrance 522iGPS.  Thanks, *Stoty"
219839,Roy,2008-06-26 14:34:00,13728,No it doesn't Stoty and neither does the lake maps show it. This map might help you a little though.  http://www.sandlakecampground.on.ca/sandlakemap.cfm
219848,Stoty,2008-06-26 15:02:00,2910,"Thank Roy. Thats where I am staying actually. I have paper maps of the lake, I was just hoping that it was on my GPS. Thats disappointing."
219900,Zubris21,2008-06-26 17:02:00,563,"Never fished Sand Lake, but I do fish a lake just south of it called Troy Lake that has some huge bass (<-- avatar) and lots of 3-4lb pike!  I don't think it has public access though.  Sand is on the Rideau Canal system though, and that waterway is world renowned partly for its fishing.  I paddled from Kingston to Ottawa a few years ago and couldn't believe the number of pike we saw/caught.  Also saw a few dead pike with nice sized walleye hanging out of their mouths, I guess they bit off more than they could chew.  Good luck on Sand, let us know how it turns out, I may venture up there sometime if you report good things!"
219937,jace,2008-06-26 18:19:00,472,"Garmin's blue chart has it.  I've been out of them for a while so don't know if there's aftermarket software to build your own maps from images but if they do, i can show you a screenshot of the area you'll be in."
219938,Roy,2008-06-26 18:21:00,13728,"Yes J ace, I have it on another Navionics chip. I PMd Stoty about it."
219952,Stoty,2008-06-26 19:08:00,2910,"THanks for the help guys.  I have fished Sand before, but a few years back. I have paper depth charts, was just hoping to utilize the GPS."
260741,idesign,2008-10-22 19:08:00,149,Can any1 tell me if great lakes include Lake Ontario.thx
260742,SlowPoke,2008-10-22 19:13:00,2984," The Great Lakes chip has Erie, Huron, Superior, Simcoe, St. Clair, Michigan, G-Bay etc but not Lake Ontario. For Lake Ontario you have to upgrade the the ""Greatest Lake"" chip."
260848,Dabluz,2008-10-23 01:57:00,701,"It is possible to play around with software programs so that you can scan paper maps, photos, images, drawings and program them into your GPS.  One program in particular is OziExplorer.  You need at least 2 gps coordinates on the paper map or photo so that the program can ""snap"" the image into it's program.  Then you can convert this image into the format that your GPS is using.  The easiest GPS's to use are Garmins.  Most of the freeware and mapping programs to do this task is for Garmin gps systems.  There are even people who will give you free maps and if they do not have them, they will make one for free for you.  If you think about it, a GPS screen is only a blank page containing millions of coordinates.  If you can get an image on this page and if you can snap it in place with already known coordinates on the image, all the other coordinates will line up."

260887,Billy Bob,2008-10-23 11:17:00,5865,Lake Ontario (eastern basin) is covered in Navionics HotMaps Premium 2008 chip EAST. Here is the site that shows ALL the lakes on this chip. If you scroll down to the NY section and then scroll all the way down to the bottom of the NY section it is the 3rd last lake listed as Ontario (Eastern Basin).  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/content/...avionics08.html
