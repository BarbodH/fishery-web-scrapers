260504,Dutch,2008-10-21 23:52:00,831,"Hey Lew.  Whatever you do, don't buy Magellan......  If you are looking for a GPS, you may want to consider text-to-speech, I hear many people can't live without it.  For an idea about the best deals out there go to redflagdeals.com in the electronics ""hot deals"" area.  There's usually a weekly deal on a GPS somewhere."
260537,Tomcat,2008-10-22 01:47:00,395,"Lew:  I purchased a Garmin Nuvi 750 in early 2007. I selected that model because it best suited my requirements - in particular I wanted a unit that would allow me to program routes (versus following the route that the GPS software selected). The mapping software with the unit was City Navigator NT North America. Unfortunately, that software didn't include logging roads. However, one can download the topographical maps of Canada and use them in conjunction with Garmin MapSource to create routes that include logging roads (comes in handy sometimes when driving logging roads to a new outfitter). I'm satisifed with the unit and can easily recommend it. Your Source reference has the Nuvi 750 at $400. It's available on-line for $365 at http://www.gpscity.ca/  I'd also recommend the following web site for reference http://www.gpspassion.com/fr/default.asp?_...rrentVersion=EN"
260579,GBW,2008-10-22 03:58:00,8460,"John, I did for a bit (less then a 2 hours but the unit had been off for 2 weeks) but it was a glitch tring to find it's location.  The XOG is great!  I still have my points marked where I went ice fishing last winter on this thing (yes this is a ""car"" GPS).  It does a lot, has a bunch of options but if all you want is ""turn left here"" voice prompts then others out there do it for less.  The XOG mounts on anything, has a build in batt. and can go most places where an std. car gps cannot (like in a boat with the Navi. map).  in the end it's up to each user but the Gramin was not for me.  Don't get me wrong they do make good stuff but it wasn't what I wanted/needed as the XOG was. Geoff"
260612,lew,2008-10-22 11:46:00,12767,"Thanks for all your suggestions folks and seeing as Garmin is the choice of most here, I'm gonna go that route myself and right now it's probably gonna be either the nuvi 260W or the 265WT even though they're a bit pricier than what I was originally thinking of.  I find it interesting though that for marine electronics, most folks, including myself, seem to prefer Lowrance units, yet for cars most seem to lean towards the Garmin products.  Interesting stuff ......."
260619,pigeonfisher,2008-10-22 12:18:00,696,I have bought a couple at RadioWorld.  They are good to deal with.  I have two garmin nuvis
260621,lew,2008-10-22 12:28:00,12767," I agree Steve, I bought a sonar from RadioWorld last year and was very happy with both the service & price of the unit, so that's probably where I'm gonna go."
260658,Raf,2008-10-22 14:08:00,3495,"[quote name='lew' date='Oct 22 2008, 07:46 AM' post='260612'  I find it interesting though that for marine electronics, most folks, including myself, seem to prefer Lowrance units, yet for cars most seem to lean towards the Garmin products.    Lew, if Lowrance & Garmin teamed up and made a Sonar/GPS combo I'd be all over it.  Hard to go wrong with Lowrance/Eagle for sonars and Garmin for GPS, no matter whether it's for a car or marine application - in my opinion of course.  For us fisherfolk the sonar comes first so we go Lowrance and get stuck with Navionics.."
260677,BigGuppy,2008-10-22 15:21:00,19,I have a Garmin 680 i bought at Costco. Check consumer reports there are lots of reviews and the Garmin Nuvi 680/7XX came up on top of the list for price and quality.
260698,BillM,2008-10-22 16:09:00,17367,"Lew, gpscity.ca has a wicked deal on the Nuvi 770 (399.95)..  It's right on their main page.  Almost $200 less then Radioworld (If you are planning on a higher model)"
260499,POLLIWOGG,2008-10-21 23:32:00,835,"I can remember all kinds of useless crap. From the Star's Wheels section  A: The provincial Highway Traffic Act prohibits having any object obstructing the driver's view through the windshield or windows.  Section 73(1) HTA states that ""no person shall drive a motor vehicle upon a highway, with any sign, poster or other non-transparent material or object placed on the windshield or on any window of such motor vehicle; or with any object placed in, hung on or attached to the motor vehicle, in a manner that will obstruct the driver's view of the highway or any intersecting highway.""  To avoid possibly running afoul of the law, it might be best to mount your GPS unit to the front of the dash (not on top) below the level of the windshield.  For safety, motorists should only rely on audio directions from the GPS rather than watching the screen when driving.  Charges under S. 73(1) HTA carry a $110 penalty. And, yes, before you write in, I'm aware that police themselves often have equipment (radar, large strobes etc.) mounted on their cruiser dashboard that blocks the driver's clear view of the road ahead. No exemption for police under this section of the HTA could be located.  Ontario Transportation Ministry spokesperson Bob Nichols adds:  Safe driving requires that you focus your attention on driving .  Navigation devices, when used properly, can make driving safer by helping to guide you to your destination with audio instructions as you drive. The risks associated with these devices typically occur when drivers try to manually reprogram them while driving.  Drivers who fail to pay attention to the driving task can face severe consequences.  For example, a ""careless driving"" conviction under S. 130 of the Highway Traffic Act carries a fine of up to $1,000, six demerit points, possible jail time, and a driver's licence suspension. Alternatively, a ""dangerous driving"" conviction under S. 249 of the Criminal Code of Canada carries a maximum $2,000 fine and up to five years in jail. The ministry will further examine this issue to see what next-generation driver distraction legislation could look like.     I remember one of the guys at work having a tiny tv in his truck back in the 70's and a cop told him it could not be in sight of the driver but I might be mistaken as it was a long time ago and this article didn't address video screens visible to the driver but did state more legislation on the way.  I'm not trying to be preachy as I've done far worse than you ever will, I just remembered the article."
