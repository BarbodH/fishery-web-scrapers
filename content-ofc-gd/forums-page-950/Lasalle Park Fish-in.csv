If you have been wanting to learn about carping, it'd be great to show up as there will be many experienced and friendly carpers who can give you a hand.  I'm currently in school (Waterloo) but I'm not sure if I'm coming home (Toronto) this weekend yet ... if I do I will try to make it out Sunday morning."
