Check it out, if this was posted already, sorry.  Daniel"

260543,The Urban Fisherman,2008-10-22 02:06:00,2050,"yeah guys - the new curado is a SICK sick reel.  I've used it on a few occasions and can't get enough of it.  Light, smooth, and I said it in another thread but the main reason I like it so much is because it's got such a low profile...I'm a smaller dude and I can easily fit my hand around it and toss baits with it all day without getting a sore wrist.....it's #1 on my xmas list this year.  Thanks for the tip on lebaron's website - always good to surf prices in canadian $'s  cheers, UF"

260661,Wild,2008-10-22 14:27:00,704,Looked at the pages and prices are slightly increased compared to this year at the moment but expect them to go even higher with our dying dollar.
