257318,anders,2008-10-10 16:52:00,1168,"remember walleyejigger, that although common sense is common, its not common is many people.  always good practice to wear hunter orange.  as mentioned by you, the only time i dont not where it is when i am bow hunting in a bow only season.  even still i will where it to where i will park my"
257335,rickster,2008-10-10 17:27:00,495,i know in our area here hunters do not have to wear orange until the moose and deer rifle season opens which for most areas is this saturday before that it is your call if you want to be safe or not (or shot at )
257358,wallyboss,2008-10-10 18:42:00,1095,"Here is the regs about hunters orange  Hunter Orange The objective of the hunter orange regulation is to maximize hunter safety without negatively impacting hunting success. Under this regulation, all licensed hunters, including bow hunters, hunting during the gun season for deer and moose, are required to wear hunter orange. As well, all black bear hunters hunting during the black bear season are required to wear hunter orange except when in a tree stand. (This exception is in place because, unlike deer and moose, black bears have colour vision.) Waterfowl hunters, spring wild turkey hunters and bow hunters in bows-only seasons, where there are no concurrent deer or moose gun seasons, are exempt from the hunter orange requirement. A hunter orange garment and head cover must be worn. The hunter orange garment must cover a minimum of 2,580 square cm (400 square inches) above the waist and be visible from all sides. Open mesh or camouflage hunter orange must not be part of the 2,580 square cm. A hunting coat or vest generally meets this requirement. The hunter orange head cover may have: open mesh; a peak or brim colour other than hunter orange; a crest or logo which does not completely cover the hunter orange on the side where it is affixed. The head cover may not contain camouflage material. Hunter orange colour standards are generally consistent across North America. Manufacturers can provide information regarding clothing compliance with this standard."
257376,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-10 19:17:00,10439,In the NWT there is no regulation requiring the wearing of hunter orange. Hunter density is much lower here than in the south. The population of Orangeville is more than the population of the entire NWT!!

Glen,you ol salty dawg,go sit in the chair in the corner.LOL"
257398,bukee,2008-10-10 20:39:00,58,"I agree that we should not be ashamed of hunting and our hunting heritage.  We should be proud to be hunters and fisherman for that matter. I work in downtown TO and have these discussuions defending hunters all the time.  If we respect our harvests and don't waste an ounce of meat than we should be proud of our actions.  Yes there are idiots in every hobby/sport, these bad apples in hunting unfortunately lead to deaths or injuries.  In fishing it migh be a lure in the head, or watching the idiot snaggers.  As outdoors people, be proud of your actions and show them off if you are comfortable about it.  Any sensible conversation on hunting is exposure and thus good for the sport.  The fishing community should realize that they are in the same boat as hunters.  If we allow hunting/gun previleges to be taken away, the next target will be fisherman.  A lot of fisherman practice C & R and thus can state that they are not killing like hunters.  But the next step then is the antis going after all fisherman asking - why hurt those poor fish?, would you like a hook in you mouth?  Poor fish, your holding it out of the water while it suffers, all for a picture? etc etc.  Be proud of your hobby/sport whether hunting or fishing.  Share the reasons why you do it with as many people as you can and our sports will remain and grow.  Thus not having to feel ashamed for what we love doing."
257415,Bernie,2008-10-10 21:48:00,3190,There are many businesses around here that shut down for a week or two during the hunting season. It's a way of life here. And many resent those that try to change it on us. There are still many people around here that depend on hunting to provide meat for their family's. The way of life here is much different from urban areas. We don't have the population here to overcome the many anti voices from the many in the large populations. And as far as having representation our local MP's have to tow the party lines and are essentially gagged. So what is the solution? I wish I had an answer that all would agree on. We don't agree with gun registry because it is a waste of taxpayers money. Anyone who wants an unregisterd gun can get one. Handguns were controlled many a year ago and it didn't control a thing then either.

260663,cisco,2008-10-22 14:34:00,597,"In my view, the reasons that blaze orange isn't required for smallgame hunting is partially because while walking around in such a conspicuous manner, others, say, who might be driving by, may call the OPP or Regional police due to their lack of knowledge and/or anti sentiment. I've had em get the police there and the police haven't a clue about hunting laws and I have to show them the regs so they can address the caller's complaint that I was trying to kill an Endangered Species.......... Canada geese!   A big waste of time and resources to have the cops bugged like that.  Also, from hunter training which we have as mandatory here Dawg, smallgame hunters are qualified and trusted to determine when and where it is best to wear their blaze orange.  I wear it when hunting in groups for smallgame , but not when I'm walking fencerows where passers-by can easily get on their celphones and make loopy accusations to get police involved.   So in a sense, to help avoid harrassment of hunters, hunter safety had to be reduced a tad to allow hunters a bit of privacy and to try and minimize the number of idiotic calls police agencies receive."

I just dont think covering your kill should be a priority, as a hunter you have payed well to the govt in tags etc....  to harvest an animal.  how much dignity is there in covering a big bull like you have done something wrong.  i say show it off and people should respect the animal that is going to help feed a family or two this winter.  i agree that by hiding it you are somewhat admitting that you have done something wrong.  all of our fore fathers survived this way and will continue to do so for eternity.  the world is in trouble when people are to feel ashamed for doing what is right and legal.  jason"

257098,AzuluSpookd,2008-10-10 01:29:00,348," Excellent point, I must say. While I was up moose hunting a few weeks ago, there's a place where there is a logging road and there is to be no motorized vehicles used at all. The hunters at the camp a few miles down the river were up near this place, walking and they saw 6 natives with pickup trucks (6) coming out of this road. They stopped, and every truck had a bull in the back. A short while later, the MNR came by and spoke to them after the natives had gone. The MNR passed them on this road and did nothing. The hunters asked the MNR why they didn't stop and question them and they said to them, ""It's out of our hands, there's nothing we can do"". 6 men, 6 bulls, no tags, no rules.  I was still happy to end up coming out of that area with my first yearling bull weighing 900 pounds. What a rush.  However....coming out of that area and looking forward to an 18 hour drive home...on the dirt roads we HAD to put the tarp over the bull and the bear because of the dust...but because the weather changed and it went from 3 degrees to 18 degrees, we had no choice but to take the tarps off to expose the harvest and keep them cool. Do I feel bad that someone didn't like seeing the moose and bear? Not at all, because it wasn't about gloating, it was about trying to keep the meat cool. Now the cutting the head off and displaying it on the roof, etc...that's something that I wouldn't do, but I do understand the excitement and the need to want to show people what you have accomplished.

If society becomes sterile to the idea of hunting and fishing we will lose our privileges (not rights) to hunt and fish.  No I don't believe it is in good taste to have dead animals exposed and ""because I can"" is not a good reason.

It doesn't bother me to say the least, but what bothers me in to days world is there is no reason not to cover it up but only to show it off.

256659,Leecher,2008-10-08 23:29:00,7832,"Gerritt,  Being a deer hunter myself, go throught the same reaction that you have experience today every year.  For the past ten years, we've transported our animals in the back of a pickup truck without being covered with a tarp simply because we don't want the meat to heat up and go to waste.  The laws from the MNR, in my case Quebec, allows a hunter to transport any big game animal onto any vehicules as long as the proper transport coupon is attched to the animal.  MNR do specify in their regulations to use better judgment as to how to transport any animal but does not in any way prevent you from displaying your catch.  We always got a mix signal reaction from people when we drove into the city, some gave us the thumbs up and some the discusting look but we don't parade for ever.  Once we get to our destination, the animal is prep up for butchering just like cows and pigs and chickens etc....  Once we finish, every member of the group goes back home with meat for the freezer and part of the winter.  Like I said in the beginning, the animal is out in eyes vue for one reason only, so that the meat does not heat which would happen under a tarp.  Leechman"

256687,Bernie,2008-10-09 00:09:00,3190,It's really too bad some people look at hunting with disdain. I'm not real keen on guys that hunt for trophy's only but it is their right. If a big buck comes along while I'm hunting it's going down but if I'm going to put meat in the freezer a fawn or a yearling is much better to eat. It's becoming progressively harder as we go to maintain our hunting and fishing rights. So do we hide what we do or advertise it? We are becoming a smaller percentage of the population and our rights as hunters and fishermen will eventually be taken away by those that oppose it. It's still legal to carry a gun uncased down the street here. But not many do it anymore. Dad used to take his gun to school to hunt on the way home.
