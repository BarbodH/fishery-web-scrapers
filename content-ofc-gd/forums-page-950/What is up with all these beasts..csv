261002,danbo,2008-10-23 22:39:00,2646,YeeHaw..ya better hope an Eagle don't swoop him off yer bow!
261069,Rizzo,2008-10-24 02:05:00,4754,"hahaha this post is killing me, danbo you've had some beauties here. In all seriousness though I bet it was Roy in his yellow cardigan. Usually it is tied around his shoulders, but on a cold night he wears it proudly."
261102,jrego7,2008-10-24 05:29:00,37,could have been a deer who knows but i wasn't gonna stick around and find out... If i had my cam on me the flash on it would have cleared things up. Scary when you're there all by yourself. You never know what's lurking in the bush. Last year we had a black bear around kitchener and cambridge area. Guess it travelled down from the north. It was sighted by a few people. I think it took them a few days to track it down. See ya never know what's out there. You may think there are no bears down south but you can't say that for sure because there could be just for that day you're out. And who know's it might cross your path. I learned my lesson no more late night solo outings. Hope you guy's don't either. At least be with someone and be prep'ed.
261427,Greencoachdog,2008-10-25 03:52:00,8163,"  JHC!!!... that's skeery!!!  Looks like Don Rickles dressed up in drag!!!   ... a ""friend"" of yours Brian?"
261437,chickenhawk,2008-10-25 04:42:00,612,i was beginning my weekend binge and painted myself gold and went running through the bush naked....sorry didnt mean to sneak up on ya like that! lol   Hawk
260906,jrego7,2008-10-23 14:22:00,37,"Within 1 week I have had 2 encounters with animals. Last week it was 2 raccoons and last night at Bronte around 9:00PM I heard something moving the leaves around. I didn't see anything so I continued to fish. A few minutes later I look up and I see this huge gold animal. It must've been around 150 lbs. A minute later I look up again and it has moved more to the left looking straight at me. I'm there by myself the girlfriend is in the truck waiting. My knife is in the truck. I'm thinking that is some cold water the easiest way to kill it is drown it if it comes at me. So I decided to leave quickly. Got snagged on the way out snapped the line and booked it lol.  I couldn't really make out what it was. Might have been someone's stray dog, A big gold one. From now on no late night solo fishing for me..."

260924,BillM,2008-10-23 15:57:00,17367,Probably a porcupine..  I had one sneak up on me while fishing specs this summer.  The thing was massive.  ..........or a deer like everyone else said
260926,kemper,2008-10-23 16:09:00,2232,"Probably a deer, I have had them sneak up on me several times while trout fishin. Anybody who doesnt hunt (me) would be amazed at how such a huge animal can get within 20 ft of you before you notice it."

260945,Greencoachdog,2008-10-23 17:39:00,8163,"I recommend one of These, you can get the small pocket sized ones and they'll scare the ungatz out of any wild animals whithin a few hundred yard radius!"
260946,highdrifter,2008-10-23 17:40:00,2534,Tunnel Monster..  They're out there.  Visit My Website  HD
260949,SlowPoke,2008-10-23 18:09:00,2984," They don't usually sneak up on you... generally you can hear them cackling and weazing as they move in for the kill. This unsuspecting young fella wasn't so lucky. Distracted by the loud music, the cougar was allowed to move in close.  "
