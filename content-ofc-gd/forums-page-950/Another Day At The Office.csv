260829,tibbs,2008-10-23 01:16:00,650,Great Report.  I can't wait to get out steelheading myself.
259950,solopaddler,2008-10-20 12:06:00,8605,"It's such a game of timing. Based on the water flow graphs I figured it would be dicey, but definitely worth a shot as it would be right on the cusp of being fishable. In preparation humongous roe bags were tied, toonie sized and larger, all in charteuse. In really stained water I prefer to use oversized chartreuse coloured bags and run a tag of hot pink yarn on the hook. For whatever reason the fish seem to like the two-tone contrast.. Floats are bumped up to the 15 gram range as tons of larger shot and longer leads are needed to deal with the water volume and to get the bait down where it needs to be. No need to finesse fish in these conditions, fluoro is a waste of money.  6lb Maxima Ultragreen for tippet at an absolute minimum. Water temps are still somewhat warm, the fishes metabolism is high, and with this much water flow the battles were long and epic...  The day dawned clear and cold, in fact yesterday was the first frost I've seen this year. The muck was frozen and the shallow puddles had a thin skim of ice as we picked our way along the path to the river. Nice to see finally, but a bit nippy on the fingertips 'till the sun finally peaked over the treetops and warmed up the valley.  My adavance prediction was tough sledding until about noon. With the water dropping and clearing throughout the day, and the sun warming the water I figured conditions would improve as the day went on. Turned out I was right   .  We started at 7am with maybe 4 inches of visibility. Almost imperceptably the river was clearing though and at 11am I finally hit my first fish: a feisty 7lb buck.    After that it was game on. Here's a few more pic's from yeaterdays action:              Don't be fooled by the seemingly clear water in this next pic. The main flow was incredibly stained....        The only downside to the day was the turmoil my buddy Fergie was enduring. He didn't have the greatest day yesterday, his head just wasn't into it. His dad's in the hospital at the moment and not doing too well. In fact right around 2:30 when things were really starting to pick up he answered his phone, talked for a bit, and just like that our day was over. It was his sis calling asking him to please come to the hospital asap... I'm pretty sure I suceeded in relieving at least some of his stress yesterday and that's all that matters, and really, that was the objective anyway.   Cheers,  Mike"
259954,Greencoachdog,2008-10-20 12:15:00,8163,Some very nice clean and rosey cheeked fish!!!
259969,Leecher,2008-10-20 13:15:00,7832,Great report and pics solopaddler  Very nice colors on those fishes Thanks for sharing Leechman
259972,limeyangler,2008-10-20 13:27:00,5204,"Great report Solopaddler, great looking fish. I'm pretty jealous as float fishing is my absolute favourite, whether sea or freshwater, and to catch fish like those must be amazing. Best wishes to your buddy Fergie, must be stressful."
259988,corvette1,2008-10-20 14:22:00,1765,great job as always hope fergie had some good news
260013,Paulus,2008-10-20 16:30:00,522,"Nice post, Mike. Loved the fifth pick. That's a great way to present the subject.  Please pass on my sympathies to Fergie.  Regards, p.-"
260015,solopaddler,2008-10-20 16:36:00,8605," Thanks bud.  That was a neat pic, would have been a great pic if it wasn't partly blurred..."
260018,wuchikubo,2008-10-20 16:51:00,1114,"Great post Mike, I went out to the Notty on Sunday and got skunked along with about a half dozen other local anglers. Almost everyone was scratching their heads as some had told me the past friday and saturday (the day before) was hot and one mentioned he had 16 bows (not sure if all were landed). But the same set up on Sunday didn't even get a tap.  I've got to get some lessons from you sometime.  Stan"
260019,jdmls,2008-10-20 16:56:00,575,Nicely Done....dirty water over the weekend ? I didn't see any rain. I take it you went for a long drive   ....you always find the honey holes !!!
260020,Roy,2008-10-20 16:57:00,13728,And an excellent day at the office it was! Great pics and beautiful fish. Thank you.
260039,silvio,2008-10-20 18:24:00,433,
260047,solopaddler,2008-10-20 18:37:00,8605," They're about to get monsoon rains up there today and tomorrow which should spread fish out throughout the system. The Notty has been fishing well, even ths past weekend, but low down in the river. Not too much happening above Monty's (until this weekend  )"
260083,lucabrasi,2008-10-20 20:59:00,114,"Great report as usual Solopaddler and some nice fish there. I read this board for inspiration and your reports certainly fit the bill. Pretty gutsy of your friend to fish under those circumstances, I probably couldn't have. Hopeful thoughts for him.  BTW, what size netting do you use to tie those tooney sized bags. I can't find netting large enough and I usually end up popping a few eggs. Makes for a messy job."
260090,drwxr,2008-10-20 21:12:00,453,"beautiful report    as usual, but i have to give you 9 out of 10 just because the report is missing location sorry about your friends dad, at least you did everything to raise his mood."
260092,fishindevil,2008-10-20 21:15:00,6254,"Great fishing trip mike !!!!   some very nice fat fall bows for sure,  nice pics too !!!...cheers"
260106,Bly,2008-10-20 21:53:00,1556,Can I work at your office Mike??     Excellent pics and fish as always.
260107,solopaddler,2008-10-20 21:53:00,8605," Mostly scarfing cut any size you wish. Yesterday I was using large pre cut squares of some kind of mesh, about twice the size of spawnee netting. Have no idea who makes it, but I bought it at Kingsway in Guelph last year."
260115,Marko,2008-10-20 22:18:00,854,"Great haul man. If not for your reports, this year i would not have seen anyone catch a rainbow and its almost November. Great Going none the less! Hopefully your friend is well and best of luck to him."
260188,ehg,2008-10-21 01:30:00,2666,"Seems like being in tune with the conditions(flow charts, weather etc...) and presenting accordingly really helped put you on the fish. Lots of great info and excellent pictures Thanks for sharing, ehg"
260192,kemper,2008-10-21 01:34:00,2232,"awesome, as usual.  just awesome"
260195,danc,2008-10-21 01:45:00,4677,Nice report Mike. You've really got those fish dialed in.
260211,ccmtcanada,2008-10-21 03:03:00,7971,"Mike, you set the standard for steelheading as far as I'm concerned!  Another great report...gotta love seeing those fish this time of year.  Hopefully we can get into some again this fall!"
260377,snag,2008-10-21 17:49:00,1932,I hope the tracking device I put on your car works.  Now only lack of skill can foil me.
260806,Streamerguy,2008-10-22 23:42:00,121,"I got to say ......your an amazing angler and have way more talent and skills then most paid pro's/tv host's combined.
