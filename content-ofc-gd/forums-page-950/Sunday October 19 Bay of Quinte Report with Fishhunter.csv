Me with the catch of the day:  a 27 inch walleyeâ€¦ my best yet:  http://img128.imageshack.us/my.php?image=sany0006yv8.jpg   The day's catch, 7 pickerel total with an average size of around 4-5 pounds, and 4 very happy fishermen:  http://img232.imageshack.us/my.php?image=sany0010hu5.jpg  Thanks a lot to Lloyd for the outing on his boat.  It was a great day out.  Thanks also for all the tips on fishing in the Ottawa area!"
