260189,Mattones,2008-10-21 01:31:00,587,I am taking my Non-restricted course this coming weekend and am a bit worried about it as i know Nothing about guns and would rather study before hand. The guy in my Hunting class this past weekend said he found the 'book' or what ever off the internet and just took the test one on one. I have tried to look for it online but with no luck.  Anyone have any idea on where i can find stuff which may be on the test to read up on? I may have found the topics covered but not sure. http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/safety-surete/safety_course_e.asp  May sound sad I know but i would rather get a head start

Muzzle control is highest importance---do not point at anything you do not wish to shoot  the rest is rules--no loaded guns on roadways---in vehicles--motorized boats  Unload your gun when crossing a fence, creek, ditch etc. where you may slip  Know your big game animals and migratory birds  Unload and open your gun if handing your weapon to anyone  Now these are the rules for us---I beleive the streets of Toronto has it's own set.  Be safe and SMART and one day you will have a photo album of these  "
260270,danbo,2008-10-21 13:52:00,2646,"Open the action of the gun & visually check the barrel for an ""obstruction"" whenever you are handed a gun..even when crossing a fence. Read the caliber of the shell / cartridge. Put trigger lock on when done for the day & putting it away in a case. Check that the safety works on the gun before you load it. Know archery stuff..minimum poundage for deer or moose. Be self-confident & act professional. No joking around with others."

260463,highdrifter,2008-10-21 22:20:00,2534,Don't forgit your calibers!!  You must know how to read them off the cartridges..  Good luck!  HD
260847,Mattones,2008-10-23 01:53:00,587, Burlington is a bit aways:( dang  iv been looking all voer for the online book with no luck. I guess i can try and read up as much as i can on the smaller stuff and hope its somewhat related to the test

261078,ch312,2008-10-24 02:28:00,1590," its good practice to use a trigger lock when transporting but there are a couple problems with them.  1)they can trap moisture between the lock and the trigger guard causing rust. 2)they are a pain if you have a bunch of guns and you grab the wrong key on your way out. 3)the master lock keyed ones can be pried open with just your fingers.  if you dont have a safe or cabinet to store your firearms (where they dont need to be trigger locked), and to be legal, the firearm must be deemed inoperable. a much better option than using a trigger lock is to remove the bolt, forend from pump actions, or use a cable lock.  when using a case, be sure the gun and case are 100% dry before storing or rust will occur rather quickly.  just pay attention if you are taking the course or study your book and talk to experienced people before challenging the exam. point the gun in an unsafe direction when doing your practical and you fail right away. handle the firearms as much as possible before the exam to be familiar with them as you need to know how to check, load, and unload guns."
261079,Mattones,2008-10-24 02:38:00,587,During the breaks I will ask if i can handle them the guns and have a good look at them before the class is all around watching you which = pressure haha
