260452,muskeybugged,2008-10-21 21:40:00,282,If anyone has any knowledge of where I can find some nice sized suckers (for Musky) it would be greatly appreciated.  I've checked with the Bobcaygeon area shops and no luck. Don't worry I plan to use them with quick set / lift off rigs!  Thanks
260458,drwxr,2008-10-21 21:55:00,453,try tackle shop in bradford marina
260464,solopaddler,2008-10-21 22:20:00,8605,"Honestly?, catch them yourself.  Back in the day when I used them for pike under a float half the fun was heading down to the creek and catching them a day or two before  .  I'd freeze a bunch of smallish 4-5""'ers as well to tip my spinnerbaits with. Large esox have an affinity for an oversized spinnerbait tipped with a sucker minnow slow rolled across the tops of shoals and weedbeds."
260468,purekgw,2008-10-21 22:28:00,585,you just need to find a bait store that gets bait from creek or like solopaddler said catch them your self its not hard find shallow creek that has suckers and start netting some
260479,Rich,2008-10-21 22:45:00,3927,"Find a shallow, muddy creek and let a worm lay on bottom. You should have a couple dozen in no time.  If you're really strapped, I'll tell ya the Grand River has them everywhere. Worms on bottom."
260484,purekgw,2008-10-21 22:50:00,585,yes the grand has tons of them TONS
260487,HTHM,2008-10-21 22:53:00,4082,Isn't it against regs to use baitfish from another body of water?
260489,purekgw,2008-10-21 22:56:00,585,yah good point so your best bet is a local creek
260495,PAZE,2008-10-21 23:14:00,132,"PRO LINE at Blackcreek dr, and Jane st, has all kinds, and all sizes."
260496,jwl,2008-10-21 23:20:00,1056,  it's against regs to bring them above the 401 from the VHS possitive zone to the negative zone for example.  Against regs to dump your bucket of bait in a body of water the bait didn't come from  my fav pike bait this time of year..I trap my own in a minnow trap baited with bread soaked in vanilla extract
260528,muskie_bob,2008-10-22 01:02:00,13,Proline is a good spot but I called today for myself and they were out.  They usually have them on the weekend.
260530,BillM,2008-10-22 01:20:00,17367,Big creek chubs should also work very well   Shouldn't have a prob catching a dozen or so in any local creek.
260751,muskeybugged,2008-10-22 20:26:00,282,"Well thanks for the response everybody!  However last night playing volleyball, of all sports, I split my hand open between the webbing of my fingers needing seven 20 lb test braided stitches.  Now I know what it'd feel like being one of them poor little suckers getting rigged up.  This little ""boo boo"" will make rigging very difficult and the driving hookset needed next to impossible.  Guess I'll have to troll these last few weekends out .  Suckers win this time!  Thanks again everyone.  "
260843,muskyhunter5150,2008-10-23 01:41:00,64,"Wow nice cut. I know you can't use them now, But the bait store in Bridgenorth has them"
