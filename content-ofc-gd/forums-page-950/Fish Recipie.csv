260649,jwl,2008-10-22 13:28:00,1056,"if you like the idea of a bit of  sweet with your fish, you can make a simular sauce/topping for you favorites using a bit of onion,peppers, mandarine oranges, and banana....saute the onions and peppers together for a couple minutes, add the oranges, heat then at the last minute add the banana, best to use very green banana,most ""island"" type countries they cook banana and eat it like we would a vegetable...when the fruit is started to turn yellow, they consider it spoiled.  Anyways, as the banana starts to soften and the starches come out, it will help naturally thicken your sauce.  As for the tuna steaks, if you marinade them in some soy sauce for a while..try this......coat it with shredded unsweetened coconut..then panfry quickly in hot olive oil..cook to about med-rare to medium....that is the best suggested way to generally serve tuna steaks.  I am not big on this particular recipe because I am pretty picky about fish..lol, but I have served/prepared dishes like this hundreds of times in my younger years of working as a chef....we used to call that one.. ""Aruba Tuna"""
