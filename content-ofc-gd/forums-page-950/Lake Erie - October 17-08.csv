260490,Arnaldo de Sousa,2008-10-21 22:57:00,21,"Well I made plans with BBR to meet up with him and go out on Lake Erie for some Bass and Perch action.  Here's a pic of 2 guys fishing behind us    and here is Rich with a nice little guy    and me with one    We tried for perch for an hour or two, but just couldn't find them.  We didn't go out too far from where we were and after not finding any perch we decided to head back for some more bass action before it got too late  and good idea cuz here's Rich with a bigger one    and here I am with a nice one too    so the day was great with good company and very good conversation and some fishing moment stories excahgned.  Was great having you in my boat Rich, and any time you want to get out, just give me shout and we'll hook up again.  Some great sunset shots to end a great day.    "
