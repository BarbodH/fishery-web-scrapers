There must have been a lot of familiar faces there. It was a super cause and I hope all went perfectly."
259712,Wild,2008-10-19 14:21:00,704,It would also be great to hear how Jim is doing but I don't think a single thing has been posted.

259714,Roy,2008-10-19 14:26:00,13728,"Well, I found this early this morning and while I don't have permission to link to the Fish-Hawk board, under the circumstances, I didn't think they'd mind. If they do, I'll take it down.  http://www.fish-hawk.net/hawktalk/viewtopi...;t=31647#254377"

259739,muskymatt,2008-10-19 15:44:00,2608,"It was sold out....  The dinner was good and the auction was very entertaining and tonnes of money was raised.   $48,000.00 and counting.  Bob Izumis day on the water went for $5500.00   WOW  Dave Mercer did a fabulous job (nice meeting you Dave)  The prizes offered would blow your mind  Video tributes that were tasteful and about as classy as it gets from all the big names.  Truely the best night you wish you never had to attend.  Big Jim......you are well loved my friend."

260810,McQ,2008-10-23 00:15:00,38,"Spent some time with ""LARGE"" today on the phone - to say he is overwhelmed is an understatement.  He is so thankful for the open and sincere well wishes from everyone (I think Cloud 9 is the right expression).  He was telling me that after the evening ended, he and Tammy went to the hotel climbed into bed and he managed all of an hours sleep - sat in the chair and stared out at the parking lot for over six hours trying to get a handle on what had taken place. As of today he still hasn't come down and is just as thrilled.  In his ever jovial way he made the point that he hadn't received so many comments containing the word LOVE ever before in his life - is wondering if maybe the hormones are kicking in early LOL.  Seriously though, Jimmy is fighting the good fight and Saturday night affirmed just how much he means to all of us, to the point where he is even more adamant to win this battle.  He doesn't have the energy to visit the websites much of late, so why don't you all reach out - - - - -  I know he would like to hear from everyone and you can reach him at ""Big"" JIm"
260811,Roy,2008-10-23 00:24:00,13728,Thanks Bill. Nicest thing I've heard today. You're a prince for bringing it up. I know that lots will be emailing the 'large'.....as I will.
260817,JustinHoffman,2008-10-23 00:46:00,482,"Was an awesome night to say the least...  I felt honoured to be a part of it, and the memories will definitely stay with me for a long, long time.  Jimmy was the first to publish an article of mine (and put me on the front cover at the same time), and that, not to mention his great friendship, mentoring, and genuine personna, really means something in this day and age.  A BIG thanks to my good friend Wally Robins for putting this all together - you did a stellar job...  Good Fishing,  Justin"
