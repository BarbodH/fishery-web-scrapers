260532,Paulus,2008-10-22 01:31:00,522,"Well,  I was going to go to some of Solopaddlers favourite haunts today, but balked at the last minute.  Instead, I fished a few rivers close to home. Weatherwise, duuuuh    it was disastrous. Sometimes the wind was so heavy that I had to pull my rod apart just to cut down on the resistance. I had my casts blown back in my face several times! Nonetheless, I persevered and caught a few. Here are some of the results...  First fish of the day:       OOOPS! I almost stepped on this little guy. At first I thought he was a piece of bark on the shore, but my Steelheader senses were tingling. Lucky for him! He posed for the camera and I was on my way. Note the ""Lord of the Rings"" style finger nails. (Frodo? Is that you?)    Here's the biggest fish of the day....    Believe it or not, in the middle of our epic battle, the above fish decided to jump straight up into the air and down into..... THIS:    She landed right in that fork shaped spot. At first, I thought that that was it. But I managed to wade out to the spot & by pulling on the outer branch was able to squeeze the line out with my hands. I had to make several tries as, obviously, wading into the middle of a holding pool really spooks your fish!  Finally, as I was walking through the woods on my way home, I came across this - as I thought - abandoned bird's nest.    I thought it was kind of cute, took a few pics and was about to walk off when I heard ... like, little bells jingling. Was that pixie dust? Curious, I looked into the nest, and this is what I saw!    Looks like I finally found my magical, chinook-roe-chartreuse-choker-bag source. Who says roe doesn't grow on trees ?!?!  p.-"
260533,jdmls,2008-10-22 01:37:00,575,"nice job..waita face the elements today...she was howling pretty bad. Sweet choker bags, LOL !!"

260610,Greencoachdog,2008-10-22 11:35:00,8163,"Nice report and pics!!!   ... but... uh, don't you think you need something in the ""biggest fish of the day"" pic for scale?"
260664,highdrifter,2008-10-22 14:41:00,2534,Well done mang!  That wee snapper is a cool find.   Super good pics.  cheers HD
260666,wuchikubo,2008-10-22 14:50:00,1114,"Beauty bows and pics there Paulus.  Are you telling me you were a nest robber! LOL  tight lines,  Stan"
260671,tdotfisherman,2008-10-22 15:08:00,317,"Nice photo's P.. The weather wasn't very good but at least you hit some steel, I fished in the snow flurries for a few hours yesterday too, but all I was seeing were old salmon, not chrome.."
260701,Leecher,2008-10-22 16:17:00,7832,Great report and pics Paulus  Cool pic of the little guy    and very nice fish  Thanks for sharing Leechman
260723,Paulus,2008-10-22 18:11:00,522,"Thanks for the compliments everyone. It's nice to be reading them from my warm chair   Bly, that's 80% luck, 10% technique, 10% skill. I snap as many as possible, as circumstances permit - that's it. I actually need a new camera, since this one (Minolta Z1) is old and has had a little (uh... a LOT) too much water get into the lens. It went for a dip in the Credit river a couple of years ago. The camera miraculously survived, but the water left some nasty spots in the lens. If the sun is shining in the lens, the shot is a complete waste.   Dooood! you have no idea! In fact you would've laughed your head off to see me trying to get that line out of there. I can't believe it held, actually. In fact, I have to put new line on my reel now. I must have scratched and scraped about 30 yards of it. Check out my blog (http://theaveragesteelheader.blogspot.com) sometime tonight or tomorrow for the official keystone cop routine...   O great shirt-less bass man    - ye of little faith! Can't you tell by the length of the shot? She was HUUUGE! ok ok... She weighed about 8lbs.  p.-"
260802,ehg,2008-10-22 23:27:00,2666,"Excellent pictures and nice chrome-like fish. Like the little snapper.  Thanks for posting that, ehg"

261170,ccmtcanada,2008-10-24 15:12:00,7971,"Awesome stuff Paulus...your pictures have always impressed me!  I actually try to emulate some of them with my own fish, but they don't turn out as nice....haha.  Mike told me yesterday to check out your blog...thanks for the posting the link...it's not bookmarked in my favoutires.  Hope to meet up with you on the creeks some day!"
261177,solopaddler,2008-10-24 15:51:00,8605," Mine either, his blog is gay."
