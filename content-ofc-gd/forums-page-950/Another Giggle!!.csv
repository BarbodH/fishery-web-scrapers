Finally they found it and approached the counter placing it on the counter for the druggist. It was a box of tampons. Druggist: Son how old are you? Boy: 8 sir. Druggist: Son do you know what these are used for? Boy: No but their not for me there for my brother. He's 4 years old. We seen on TV if you use them you can swim & ride a bike. Right now he can't do either.
