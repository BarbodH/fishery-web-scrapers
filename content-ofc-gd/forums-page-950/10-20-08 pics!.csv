260523,Bly,2008-10-22 00:48:00,1556,"It has been a cold, wet, snowy day here...figure I will grab a nice cup of tea, a few cookies and read a few reports, maybe see some good fish porn...  This was sooo not the post to read while eating....thanks Glen!  Great catches, especially the new PB....hope the finger heals fast"
260558,Sinker,2008-10-22 02:38:00,8692,"Yanno.....I've had many puncture wounds, but never a hook.......YET!!  I've had many nails in many different parts of my body, a few staples......one right thru the bone in my big toe.......but never a hook. I""m not looking forward to the day it does happen.....and I'm sure it will!! Thanks for the pics of the procedure to remove it when it does happen.......very informative fer sure!! I bet that smoke afterwards was REALLY good huh  Oh ya......nice fish too  Sinker"
260564,PatrickGG,2008-10-22 02:47:00,562,"Your a trooper Dawg, Tons of spotted bass looks like a good day on the water and the sacrifice was a painful one."
260582,Badger Shark,2008-10-22 04:32:00,291,"Great report Dawg!  I know exactly how that feels, last year my rod locker door fell and pushed my taildancer right up and under my knuckle, I did the same as you, pushed it through after taking pics of course.      Funny think about the knuckle hooking, it didnt hurt at all.  I was hooked once before when a damn sunfish got caught on a stinger and while I was removing it he jumped and the other hook got me in the thumb so now I have a hook in me and a fish attatched.  So I have to push it through, who knew thumb meat was so thick!"
260601,Whopper,2008-10-22 10:22:00,2174,"Your PB spot is a very respectable fish dawg, good report. I have yet (knock on wood) buried a hook in myself past the barb, glad to hear it healed up for ya."
260602,b2kptbo,2008-10-22 10:28:00,1505,"Gotta be tough as nails, congrats on the PB and a good haul aswell, well done..."

260807,Rizzo,2008-10-22 23:55:00,4754,"ouch! brings back memories from this summer when my 2 year old fell on a supershadrap. Makes for memories, but not too fun while you're going through it."
260835,brad_001,2008-10-23 01:23:00,11,"hey,  great post!  you must have a hell of a lot of patience to take pics of your hand getting pierced, a camera is the last thing i'd think of.... oh and...nice fish too..."
260900,limeyangler,2008-10-23 12:54:00,5204,OUCH!!!!!! holy crapaola.....thats gonna sting. 10/10 for the days catch though...quite the session you had there GCD!
260923,ehg,2008-10-23 15:56:00,2666,"That's brutal! At least you caught alot of decent fish. Real nice PB spotted bass  Thanks for pics, ehg"
260242,Greencoachdog,2008-10-21 11:55:00,8163,"Got on the water at noon yesterday, just as they fired up one turbine at the dam for generation! It was a cold day (70*F) hence the black T-shirt.  The fishin' wasn't as fast paced as last time but was still good!  First fish!  This fish came on the 3rd cast and hit real close to the back of the boat.  Second fish, I dropped the Roostertail down at the back of the boat where I'd caught the first one and the line went slack. Pulled back on the rod and the Roostertail stayed where it was, dang! Snagged on the grate!!! Reefed on the rod to free the lure and the snag bolted for open water!!!  After a good fight I brought this very respectable 19 1/2"" Spot to the boat!   Then a nice sized little one!   Then my PB tie!!!  Unfortunately my PB is a 69"" 150 lber.... me! (yeah I've done this before... the first time was in the knee!) I had just swung the 4th fish into the boat and reached out to grab the line to take the weight off the rod and unhook the fish, just as I touched the line the fish flipped off and the rod flexed back slingshotting the 1/4 oz Roostertail into my finger! Dammit Man!!!... Butthole pucker went to Defcon 4!  I wasn't about to screw up a good day fishin' by going to the doc and I didn't want to just snatch the hook out with the pliers, does more damage than good... I like my pain in smaller doses over an extended period of time  So I started the ""pushing thru"" procedures. Ooooooo the nasty words I said while doing that!!! Push, mash flesh down on to the point, and cuss... repeat!  Finally got'er thru!   Cut the point and barb off...  As soon as I slid the hook back out the way it went in, the ""Butthole pucker"" went from Defcon 4 to ""at ease"" and I cut a huge fart of relief!!! Ahhhh!  Sat back and fired up a cigarette to regain my senses!  Good to go!  This is the little turd that slung the hook into my finger!   Was able to catch 2 more, and then they shut down the turbine and turned the water off.   When the turn the water off the fish go into ""Lockjaw Mode"", so I decided to go drag Sabiki rigs around.  Not much action on the Sabiki's for 3 hrs, 3 small Blue cats.  They turned the water back on at 5 pm, but the sun had come over the dam and there wasn't any shade so I knew that would be a bust... so I went to the long point at the creek/main river junction in hopes that the Spots would come up to feed. They didn't disappoint me!  Dragging Sabiki rigs loaded with live shiners and throwing my homemade wobble jigs, the action was pretty fast paced about 90 mins before sunset!  Caught oodles of dinker Spots casting the jig, and nothing real big on the Sabiki's... but it was fun!   The only Largie of the day      The Boudreaux fish showed up, and before I could get him back in the water he took me for a half a pack of smokes and my extra Bic lighter!... damn thief!!!   This was the biggest of the Blue cats.   This is what the Spots were puking up.  Little Threadfin Shad about 1 1/4"" long.  It was a good day on the water despite the hook in the finger!"
260245,Beats,2008-10-21 12:00:00,543,There's a true fisherman.  Sticks himself with a hook and takes pics to help document a step by step guide on its removal.  Nice fish too
260248,lew,2008-10-21 12:13:00,12767,"Dang Dawg, that hurt just reading the story.  Been there, done that so I know what you went thru bud .....not alot of fun  Good to see you re-couped though and went on to have a great day on the water."
260250,mattyk,2008-10-21 12:15:00,2110,"great report dawg! Great looking spot! Looks pretty painful, thanks for sharing with us."
260251,Roy,2008-10-21 12:20:00,13728,"Looks like a good time Dawg. Yanno, I didn't really need to see the finger pics. Woulda taken your word for it. Some very nice fish there. Congrats on the PB tie. Those threadfins look good enough to eat. I guess y'all have to go out and buy a new hook eh? Aren't you glad you had the Gerber tool with you?  Thanks for posting Bubba."
260252,jediangler,2008-10-21 12:24:00,1923,"Great report and surgery pics GCD. You're really dialed in on your home lake. I still wish we had some of them spotted bass up here, pretty fish."
260253,ccmtcanada,2008-10-21 12:27:00,7971,"Wow Glen!!  Nice pb....in order to beat that one, I suppose you'll have to eat a bigger lunch just before!  Great pics...you got into a ton of nice fish!"
260255,Wild,2008-10-21 12:32:00,704,Ha a good reason to go barbless! lucky it was a smallish hook you guys use down there instead of the monster size we need to catch the really big ones residing in our cool crisp water!
260259,danbo,2008-10-21 12:41:00,2646,Shucks Dawg.. yer more fun than a Martian doin' the Macarena!! http://img134.imageshack.us/my.php?image=aliendancemy4.gif

260285,danbo,2008-10-21 14:42:00,2646,"Ya might wanna cancel your ""Knife Throwing"" act tonite..just in case!!"
260289,1leggedangler,2008-10-21 14:57:00,364,Beauty report Glen! Nice day of boating them spots. Good job on the self surgery!  Cheers. 1leg
260290,snag,2008-10-21 15:00:00,1932,"Nasty, nasty!!!!  Congrats and Owwwwww.  Somehow I knew you would endure and fish on.    "
260295,johnnyb,2008-10-21 15:12:00,3413,"After the detailed description of the butthole puckering, when you said ""this little turd""....I thought we were in for some REALLY graphic pics....I'm glad it was just another fish"
260306,solopaddler,2008-10-21 15:26:00,8605,"Nice post, but OUCH! Way to bounce back from the mishap  .  (I feel your pain, it happened to me last year in one of my back lakes. Hook was embedded in the top of my hand. I just ripped 'er out  )"
260321,wuchikubo,2008-10-21 15:57:00,1114,"Yowouch! Glen, congrats on the PB (I think), nice work on the removal and I hope your tetnus shots are up to date.  Nice reminder for me as to why I should have a first aid kit handy.  Stan"
260334,corvette1,2008-10-21 16:18:00,1765,ouch looks like you had a good day bass fishing
260381,Leecher,2008-10-21 17:54:00,7832,Great detail report and pics Glen Ouch    that must of hurt  Never happen to me but happen to my niece..... she had the treble hooks imbedded into the back of her head  Nevertheless you had a great day on the water and some good looking spots Thanks for sharing Leechman
260386,Rich,2008-10-21 18:04:00,3927,"Great report as always Glen, that has to be the biggest spotted bass I've ever seen.  And might I add - OUCH to the treble. I think we've all been there!"
260390,highdrifter,2008-10-21 18:10:00,2534,Holly crow that's a purty spot..  And a resounding ouch budday..  Glad you persevered!!  Did ya git your tetanus shot?!  HD
260398,bigugli,2008-10-21 18:19:00,6138,"Been there a few times GCD. Glad it punched through easy enough. It's a lot worse when someone else gets hooked and they ask you to get it out, Yeesh!! 2 best first aid tools in the boat, a good set of plier/cutters for hooks, and duct tape for even the worst pike gash. Last gash i got was 2 inches long, shoulda had stitches. Got back to civilization 4 days later and it was sealed up pretty good."
260416,fishermccann,2008-10-21 19:22:00,655,"Your stories always make me smile.  they are great. Today  was no different , sorry."
260427,Paully,2008-10-21 20:17:00,712,Done that before ...  takes alot of courage to push the hook thru some more!
260448,JohnF,2008-10-21 21:25:00,3494,"So, the truth. Did ya puke when you pushed that thru? I came close just looking at the pics.  JF"
