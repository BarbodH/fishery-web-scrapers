260771,Streamerguy,2008-10-22 21:15:00,121," I'm sorry to hear that,but funny story telling,thanx for the chuckle  and great catch... gotta love them steelheads  Streamerguy"
260774,Paulus,2008-10-22 21:33:00,522,"Sweet! I know where you were  I almost headed out that way, as I started my day close to there, but decided otherwise. It's nice to get them on a kwik fish. Didn't you wear your waders?  p.-"
260776,Paulus,2008-10-22 21:38:00,522, too true... too true... LOL
260779,Paulus,2008-10-22 21:50:00,522,"  Been there... done that.... With our little hooks, it isn't so bad. Here's the technique:  1) if possible place hooked digit in river until pain from cold exceeds pain from hook 2) during digit submersion if you have any old kleenex or Tim Horton's napkins in your pocket, have them handy 3) using forceps or needlenose pliers, firmly (firmly, mind... not too loose) pinch hook where it bends 4) pull very quickly, really fast fast fast. 5) apply napkin or kleenex (or band aid, if you're that smart)  Note: if quikfish hook and not no 12 steelhead hook, god luv ya! Either upgrade material in steps 2 and 5 to gauze - or disregard entire procedure and go to the Hospital... yikes!  p.-"
260797,Bly,2008-10-22 22:59:00,1556,"  I was wearing waders but out of laziness, they were only hip waders.  My chest waders have a leak that I have been too lazy to deal with.  Guess I can find that leak while I am waiting for the others to dry out  Thanks for the hook removal tips!   Excellent idea of holding underwater til numb, much less painful then the 5 shots it can take to numb one finger!"
260799,Joey,2008-10-22 23:10:00,9122,"Beautiful fish Carole.  That surf sure looks nasty.  Glad you pulled yourself out of that mud and to safety, I've heard horror stories about rivers and waders.  We used to use kwikfish all the time for salmon and they just love them, good lure change choice.  Joey"
260805,ehg,2008-10-22 23:35:00,2666,"Great story and nice fish! Sounds brutal weather-wise, but getting into fish probably made it all worthwhile.  Thanks for sharing, ehg"
260830,tibbs,2008-10-23 01:17:00,650,Nice Job Bly!  Looks like you had a good day even with the bad weather.
260852,mistyriver1,2008-10-23 02:29:00,600,"Bly, great report  You are a hardcore angler for sure.  Another way to dry out your waders is to shove newspaper in them.  It absorbs the water pretty good as well.  Jim"
260855,fishindevil,2008-10-23 02:40:00,6254,"Nice fish carole !!!!   well done,and you had to know it was going to happen sometime,everyone who has ever wore wadders,for a few years has went for a little dunking !!!! you did it better than me,i went in head first one time after tripping on a root,along a creek bank with a drop of about 4 ft right into a trout hole where 5 or so people were fishing !!!!   so much for the peace & quiet till i got there !!! but good going girl...cheers"
260724,Bly,2008-10-22 18:12:00,1556," I have seen pictures of streamers but never used one....care to educate on the technique and presentation??   I am really looking forward to hearing how it goes tomorrow...ok, a little envious also   Since they are already soaked, I give them a good rinse to remove the mud etc. and then hang them from the boots until they stop dripping,  stuff a towel down in the boots to absorb as much moisture as possible, after I think I have as mush of it as I can get, I place a new dry towel in the boots and leave it for a few hours......after that, hang by the boots again.   This worked great the last time Cliff soaked a pair.   Gee, he acts like he didn't know they were there........Thanks for helping him out with his perspective"
260729,silvio,2008-10-22 18:31:00,433,All I need to say is wtg bly and....... lol Cliff. Poor Cliff bly is doing a number on you. Once again great job bly keep them coming.
