How far do you need to run from the marina in order to get into so fish?  I have never fished out of there before but I am thinking about moving the boat from Lake E to Lake O for next year so any info you have would be amazingly helpful!  Thanks, Rob"
260450,jwl,2008-10-21 21:27:00,1056,"July and August you don't have to go too far to get into some fish, there are a couple areas that hold good numbers of fish that time of year, it's a spot where fish will start to stage for the fall run.  GUys who fish the tail end of the SCG&F derby do ok pretty close to there"
260682,rock34,2008-10-22 15:37:00,215,Cool Thanks. I have been told that I would be wasting my time there in July and August.
