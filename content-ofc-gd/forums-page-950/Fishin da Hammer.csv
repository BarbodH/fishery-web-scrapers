260904,bigugli,2008-10-23 13:44:00,6138,I know what you mean. I grew up in the Skokas when pike and (in the old days) pickerel were plentiful and easy to catch. Down here perch are plentiful and you have to work at the pike and walleye.
260081,bigugli,2008-10-20 20:56:00,6138,"Wanted to get out today, but the chauffeur was not going into Niagara today.  So I got wifey to drop me off in Hammy harbour for a few hours while she ran errands.  The gobies really like minnows and twister tails, but despite that nuisance I found fish.  All I needed to do was cast out a distance and let my bait sink in 30 ft of water, then slowly drag it back. This fella caught me off guard   Tonight we will dine on some fresh perch. Only kept them because their swim bladders were right out the mouth, or they were gut hooked.   It was a great few hour outdoors."
260084,jwl,2008-10-20 21:01:00,1056,"Bruce..I see you are at it again, and got into some decent fish to boot...we need to get out soon,perhaps a pike mission is in order..my boat is home now too"

260097,canadianboy,2008-10-20 21:37:00,83,what kind of fish is the first one?
260098,danbo,2008-10-20 21:37:00,2646,It would be safer to eat your bait..
260113,Marko,2008-10-20 22:11:00,854," First fish is bullhead, its in a catfish family, very common."
260129,Leecher,2008-10-20 22:55:00,7832,Great report and pics bigugli  Well done for a few hours work     Them perch surely will make a good fry Thanks for sharing Leechman
260152,Rich,2008-10-21 00:23:00,3927,"Nothin' like a good feed of fresh perch! Hamilton's panfish are plenty safe to eat, in small doses."
260168,bigugli,2008-10-21 00:43:00,6138," No algae around today that I could see.  As for the perch, like most other schooling fish in the harbour, they run in and out from L Ontario.  As for any toxic crap, I've been eating fish loaded with crap from the mines and the mills up north since being a wee fart.  Many a ""pristine"" lake up North have very high natural occuring levels of heavy metal contamination. It occurs in runoff and eventually ends up in fish, game, wild blueberries, and the meat at the grocery store."
260171,bigugli,2008-10-21 00:48:00,6138," Anything is better than sitting at home all day.  I can only handle so many hours of the dysfunctional clan every day.  I'm sure they feel the same about me too.      I'm just not ready, yet, to be the hot item on the 6 o'clock news"

260178,Greencoachdog,2008-10-21 01:04:00,8163,"That's a cute little Bullhead!... fat and sassy lookin'!!!  Those Perch look good and fresh!  Limiting your consumption and eating the smaller fish like that should be ok, and like you said... a lot of people don't realize that the fish they ate 20-30 yrs ago were a lot dirtier than the fish today!  Quit eating them when you become your own nightlight!"
260181,bigugli,2008-10-21 01:14:00,6138, Good'un
260184,hammercarp,2008-10-21 01:19:00,964,WTG! Nice looking perch. Were you at Pier 8? That's where the Discovery Centre is.  That bullhead is that fat from eating all the bait we put in there for carp.
260186,bigugli,2008-10-21 01:23:00,6138,That be the place alright. He was quite the little football. The darn gobies were real fat too!
260208,hammercarp,2008-10-21 02:44:00,964,The next time you're there come on over a say hello to us carpers. There are usually a few of us fishing along the pier just east of the discovery centre.
260210,Marko,2008-10-21 03:02:00,854," How much luck are you guys having this late in the season?? Hooked into two at St Mary`s the other day and they did not put up any fight, almost felt like dragging a dead weight."
260213,hammercarp,2008-10-21 03:15:00,964,Along Pier 8 we have been steadily catching. Usually 8 to 12 lbs. We are searching around for the biggies who should be putting on the feed bags. Some of our guys got into them up to 38 lbs. at the east end of the harbour on Sunday. The water temp. is still hanging in at around 60 F. They are still fighting pretty good here.
260214,Marko,2008-10-21 03:22:00,854," Thats good to hear. I was fishing in the shallow and the water was very cold. Washed my hands in it and couldn't feel my fingers for good couple of minutes. That probably has to do a lot with them not fighting. They were also very dark and a lot slimier then they normally are. Up to 38 pounds, those are monsters. Most of the ones i catch are 2-6lb."
260220,cram,2008-10-21 06:49:00,1733,"great fishing, but be careful eating out of that harbour.  Even if the fish aren't residing full time in the bay....if htey come in there to feed, you are what you eat if you know what i mean."
260260,Wild,2008-10-21 12:48:00,704,Great way to spend the day Bruce and I don't see any double heads on the perch which is a good sign!
260267,Hooked,2008-10-21 13:29:00,891," I guess you fish with Mark?  I first met him there while he was carping.  A fine guy he is, and very informative.  BTW bigugli, nice catches you got there.  You got me motivated to head out there now."
260311,bigugli,2008-10-21 15:32:00,6138,"Next time, I'm hoping the wife will drop me at LaSalle while she runs errands."
260857,fishing,2008-10-23 02:44:00,167,"Nice report. There are some big brown bullhead and big perch there. Also, many white perch, some bass, channel catfish, rock bass, sunfish and goldfish there."
260899,limeyangler,2008-10-23 12:52:00,5204,Nice catch....i've not tried perch yet....too many walleye up here...lol.
