LOL... brought up some old fishing magazines from the late 1940's and Jaden apparently takes issue with this one.    Monique found this lamp at the local flea market...  we knew we had a place for it at camp!!    And yesterday evening we had the most incredible rainbow...  its so quiet here.... but that will change when Monique, Avery and Nicole join us today!!  Then it wont be quiet anymore!!        "
