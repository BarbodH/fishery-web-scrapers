1007376,Tmonz,2017-06-25 17:49:00,4,"Hi everyone, I have a 1990 Doral Eclipse and have purchased a set of Big Jon Downriggers. I am trying to figure out the best way to mount them onto the gunnel. The top of the gunnel has a step plate that would be the best location I believe. this step plate section runs about 10"" and the screws to hold the step plate on were in about 1/2"" and did not penetrate through the top layer of fibreglass. Please see attached photos. As of now, I am going to ad a backing plate and screw them down into the top of the gunnel to support the mount. please see attached photos..  Any help is greatly appreciated  "

And you don't have the riggers to give context - however - if you are thinking of mounting where you have that metal bracket, - -are you doing anything else to support the fibreglass there? or just mounting to the top of the step? Are you putting a backing plate underneath?  I would think you want a U bracket to go over the step and secure it from the top and the sides to backing plates underneath. Even an 8lb ball at the end of a boom in 2 foot waves will put a lot leverage on your base plates. You could do worse that to talk with Dave at Trojan Tackle.  A few bucks now will save a ton of heartbreak later"

Haven't decided what material and exactly how to configure it. I have a friend who is able to make me an aluminum base plate that should work.  I will upload some more picture, I was having an issue with it earlier. Hopefully these pictures will give a better impression of my set up.  I didn't realize that there is a limit to how many photos --  can't add additional."

Make sure it is a good piece longer than the mount to help spread the load. Shouls work fine."

Thanks. That seems to be the consensus on how to mount riggers on this boat. I think I will mount directly behind the step plate in order to keep it fully intact."

Do they make a track system for this type of mount seen in one of the pics?"
