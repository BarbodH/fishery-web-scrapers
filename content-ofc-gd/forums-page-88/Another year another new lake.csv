1007202,spincast,2017-06-22 23:02:00,3279,"Blastin' out early Saturday Morning, we greeted the Sun as we hit the split.   'bout 6 hours later we arrived at the low key lodge for the week. Greeted by a blast from the past, as I zoomed in and read the screen, I laughed my you know what  off -  your call is important to us....   having said our hello's we headed to our shack for the next 7 days initial views are thumbs up!         If you look closely, you can see the rocks are laid our in U shapes with the open end facing down river. Turns out this used to be a hatchery for walleye for 30 years.  The temps had shot up from relatively mild, to mildly stoopid, We hit the water in search of some fins and grins, but the heat and high sun lead to a slow day and quick dehydration. We headed back to the swamp for a few bevvies and a meal After supper we headed down to the river to see if we could entice some swimmers before the mossies turned us into a blood buffet. We were greeted with moderate success    and yes,, they are open all year where we were......    as the sun went down and darkness settled over the land  i managed to tag a nice dark eye too   Next morning while the coffee was brewin' headed down for a quick few casts and was greeted by a nice fatty sitting the fast water     The next day dawned stinking hot and humid again.  After a slow fish we headed back to the cabin during the ""dead-zone"" hours, and refreshed our tired aching limbs   and passed the time reading articles on the target species, chilling our feet and enjoying a bevvy of choice   These critters had just come off their nests and were lurking and hungry     alll except for this poor girl. she stayed there the whole week, unless someone got too close, picking caterpillars off the shores and fanning a bed with nothing in it.  Not sure what happened to her's but she was an empty nester and just didn't know it   that night all hell (and our dock) broke loose as a micro burst blew through, blowing down trees and putting out power. It stayed out for the next 18 hours.. Fortunately I had brought a shore lunch kit and between it and flashlights we managed to make our meals and morning coffee.       Next day greeted us sunny but cool first thing. Having got some hints from the regulars we headed to the ultra skinny water and put on a show of finesse fishing with (be sure to say in a midwest US drawl) ""crawlers.... with weight or without""  had a blast and put about 40 of these in the boat over the next few hours           managed to find supper, too    Next day started off with a bang - three nice eyes in 30 minutes, and then lock jaw set in.    For the rest of the week we had to work pretty hard to put them in the boat - although the bass were always there for relief, even if not in the same numbers.  First time we have come away with less than our limit of eyes from a trip - but we were close.  We don't count, or measure, other than those that were suspected PB's. Kev got a PB at 18.75, and I got his twin brother - but was short of my PB. They were however a complete riot - jumping, tail dancing, walking on water diving under the boat  We did go through 20 dozen worms, 6 dozen minnows, 1 dozen leeches and donated a few crank baits to the rocks. Almost all of those produced for us.  We were disappointed in pike - both quantity and quality, ah welll. there's always next year.  Time to go back to the big water...."
1007205,Pikeslayer,2017-06-23 00:14:00,1443,"Well done Rick !!! Seems the mossies did well too? Does ""shack"" accurately describe the accommodations?? The Mistress is coming home with me on Monday so a date on the big water appears to be in the very near future"
1007209,spincast,2017-06-23 00:50:00,3279,thanks Sy - the shack was actually not bad - typical for a lodge and very affordable all things considered.     you know where to reach me if you need time on the water before yours is out. I am doing an extended July 1 long weekend - bracketing either side of the standard
1007212,Rizzo,2017-06-23 01:45:00,4754,"Nice report, thanks for taking the time to post it! Just wondering though if you caught that first pickerel in the water or was it trying to burrow a tunnel somewhere?   That sucker is dirty!"
1007231,T-Bone,2017-06-23 12:40:00,160,Cool report...that storm is crazy! You never mentioned where you were...actually read like you were purposely trying not to indicate where you were. Why?
1007277,Freshtrax,2017-06-23 20:55:00,2215,Nice Rick looks like a week well wasted

Why? very perceptive: its a fishing report.   easy enough to pm me if someone is interested in location 37 members, 82 guests, 0 anonymous users  Nice Rick looks like a week well wasted Thanks Andrew - for a change we didn't get wasted    - this week was a much bigger waste - but it pays the bills. green ladderbacks tomorrow? I'll text you"
1007289,misfish,2017-06-23 23:46:00,29133,Now thats relax.n. Thanks for the report Rick  
1007455,T-Bone,2017-06-26 18:12:00,160,"very perceptive: its a fishing report.   easy enough to pm me if someone is interested in location 37 members, 82 guests, 0 anonymous users    Still don't get it. What's to keep secret? From your report you traveled 6-hours for serviceable cabins and marginal fishing in an environment that looks like the hand of man has written its story over it for many, many years...complete with lowhead dam, environment feature signage, and a quaint walking bridge. I wouldn't think there will be a mad rush by Forum members to get there this season...or probably ever. I think your secret is safe. Many (most) other forums fishing reports are complete with lake, outfitter profile / pricing, depth fish were most active at, presentation techniques that worked best, etc. I respect your position though. Thanks."
1007633,MCTFisher9120,2017-06-28 12:25:00,3761,Looked like a fun trip to me guys! Got to love smallies there a riot when they cooperate!  Thanks for posting

1007828,T-Bone,2017-06-30 12:09:00,160,"OK...I re-read the rules...don't see where any breach occurred. I was simply commenting how it seemed odd there was not GENERAL info about lake, outfitter review (didn't have to post name), cost, fishing behavior at the time, techniques tried and results. Didn't request info on specific locations, etc. I guess it would be silly to expect or request that type information in a public manner on a public fishing discussion board. But then again, to expect a ""fishing report"" NOT to report that type of information seems absurd."
1007883,spincast,2017-06-30 17:31:00,3279,"each to their own T-bone. I suspect once you spend some time around here you will see all kinds of different reports - some full of the details you're looking for and many more that are just folks sharing their time on the water. Not everyone is looking for what you after - in a trip, or a report. I personally don't provide the "" virtual tourist guide "" kind of post. Nor do  I particularly make an effort to post  the biggest fish of the trip - although, yeah if I get a trophy or a PB I will share that.  I have limited time to put together a post due to family commitments - so what you see is what you get. If it isn't to your taste, skip it or head to the sites that do -but,  heh,I respect your position though."
