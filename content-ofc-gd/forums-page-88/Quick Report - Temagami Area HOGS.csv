The lake is mostly known for lakers and the boys limited out within hours. What was really special was the sheer size of the walleye this year. Normally we hook into a few and size is pretty good, but this year was special. One of the boys, let's called him Jay, pulled in a 10.2, 8 and 7 pounder in 2 days. All on home-made harnesses, I believe with heavy duty fluoro, large plastic blades and beads. Pictures below... these walleye are big even by Erie standards, but they came out of a small northern ontario lake. See for yourself!  Edited the pictures because I haven't asked the guys to post  Album link: http://imgur.com/a/P4GE6"
