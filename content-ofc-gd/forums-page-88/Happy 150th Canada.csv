1008073,ketchenany,2017-07-02 23:45:00,3229,Come on up/ down. I'm into Tourism. Did you know that 10% of Americans have to drive south to come to Ontario! This will get me in c rap with Art. but Sault Marie Michigan is way north of our capital.
1008107,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-03 15:05:00,8243,"Yep, we actually live south of Buffalo as well as a large portion of the North East States."
1008109,dave524,2017-07-03 15:13:00,4508,"Yep, we actually live south of Buffalo as well as a large portion of the North East States.  Pelee Island is actually further south than northern California, so I've heard it said."
1008114,aplumma,2017-07-03 17:33:00,6896,It is not how far North you are or how far South you are it is if it gets warm enough for you to be comfortable.So far Virginia is as cold as I like to be. lol.   Art
1008119,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-03 18:16:00,8243,"I remember being warm in June and July, I miss those dats this summer. 10C last week at night. Furnace came on. I have been turning on the gas fireplace in the dinning room to take the morning chill off, until 11:00 AM!!!! Wore shorts Saturday for the first time this year."

1007945,lew,2017-07-01 14:04:00,12766,Not another place in this big old world I'd rather live.
1007946,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-01 14:08:00,8243,That is too cool. How did you do that? I remember like yesterday the entire school being let out to sing Oh Canada in 67'. I can't remember is that the year we got our new flag?  I have been lucky enough to travel to every continent other than the Antarctic and can tell you without any qualms we live in the best country on this planet. We have our problems like every other country but I would never choose to live the rest of my life anywhere else.  Happy Birthday Canada.
1007947,ketchenany,2017-07-01 14:11:00,3229,"Flag was 1965! We arrived July 1 1960, never forget that day!"
1007949,outllaw,2017-07-01 14:15:00,1232,"I remember the 100 was in grade 8,cool thing was centennial coins..happy Canada day,in the greatest country on earth."
1007958,Rodbender,2017-07-01 14:49:00,1027,That is too cool. How did you do that?  Happy Birthday Canada. Pretty easy set a Canada Flag about 3' behind the blade of grass spay grass with water focus on the water drop and presto the refraction of the flag comes through then rotate image so Flag is right side up  My set up was Nikon D7200 Tameron 90mm f2.8 Macro lens Nikon Sb700 flash with diffuser set at TTl Yongnuo Flash off camera to light the Flag Yongnuo 603 Flash Triggers Stand and clamp to hold the blade of grass Spray bottle to mist the grass
1007962,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-01 15:09:00,8243,"Excellent RB. You sure have some Primo equipment there. I took photography for a year at Sheridan back in 73' (they had a Football team) and had to buy a 2"" format Hasselblad, $3500.00 then!!! The price of a new car. Sold it for 4 grand a year latter.  Yes 1965 was when we got our own flag. Many of the Gen Xers and Millennials have no idea what The Canadian Ensign is.  Anyone remember Bobby Gimby's Canada song from 67'.  The slide show sure brings back some old memories.  "
1007963,manitoubass2,2017-07-01 15:40:00,11391,You can tell it's July 1st! Dui/seatbelt checks everywhere here by 10am hahahah.  Enjoy your day everyone and don't drink and drive!  Cool pics rodbender!!!!  Best country on earth hands down!  Happy bday Canada!!!  ??????????????????????????

Someone must have slipped me a Mickey Finn. Fell out of bed and I bruised a few ribs. Celebrated Canada Day with the neighbours around a camp fire a day early.
1007966,manitoubass2,2017-07-01 15:57:00,11391,Hahaha yep for a good 20 mins!

1007979,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-01 22:00:00,8243,"Hey Art, you spelled neighbour wrong. An early happy 4th to you too. We will be going over the ditch to Western NY to visit family and have a traditional US BBQ. My favorite is the split chickens on the real deal 4'X8' table top BBQ with blazing charcoal that we get from the Live Hose and a plate full of Aunt Franny's Mac and Cheese. I wonder if any of my Canuck friends here know what "" the Live Hose"" is? Ooops forgot the sacks full of Little Neck Clams. When we were kids we charged all the Uncles a penny each to open them."
