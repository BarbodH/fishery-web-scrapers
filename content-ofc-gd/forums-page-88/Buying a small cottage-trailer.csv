It's mostly a place for my dad to spend time when he retires and can take a boat out by himself. He loves fishing walleye, pike and bass. We fish the north channel near Spanish Ontario and that's one of his favourite places to be. It's a 5 hour drive from us which isn't an issue for him. I was also thinking nippissing. The reason I'm posting is because I'd like to hear where some of you guys would get a place. Me and my brother also primarily fish for musky once the season opens so it's nice to have Musky in the lake but it's about my dad not us. We want to stay away from busy areas like the kawarthas."
