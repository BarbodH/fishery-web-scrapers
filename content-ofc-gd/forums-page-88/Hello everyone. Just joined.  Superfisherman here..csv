1007923,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-01 00:55:00,8243,Anyone that calls themselves Superfisherman has to answer questions not ask them.  Welcome aboard.
1007925,Superfisherman,2017-07-01 01:18:00,5,True.  But that's what the model of my  boat is called. Not my experience . Lol
1007929,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-01 01:51:00,937,Welcome to OFC!  Lots of great info in the search feature
1007933,OhioFisherman,2017-07-01 03:34:00,6623,"Welcome! never been to either, but what do you want to fish for?"
1007942,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-01 13:33:00,8243,Well how do ya like that? I have a StarCraft Superfisherman 190 in the driveway. It can get a bit embarrassing when I get the Skunk.
1007959,Superfisherman,2017-07-01 15:02:00,5,i will fish for any sport fish.  Mostly catch and release.
1007997,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-02 07:04:00,8243,"Pick one. Both hold fish, no own here will be able to put you on a spot. The best thing about fishing is finding them then catching them. We can hammer the fish in a spot one day go back the next day or even the same day latter and nothing. I have been told some of those critters can do 20 KMS an hour or more. Do the math.  Good luck to you and as I said before we have the same boat. You have good taste when it comes to boats. Get out there and find them."
