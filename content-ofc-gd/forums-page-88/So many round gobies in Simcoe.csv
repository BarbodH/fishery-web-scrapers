I ended up fishing the marina side to get some rock bass so I could at least get a lunch out of my time spent.  I had more dead gobies in a pile next to my bucket than what was in my bucket.  Is there anything MNR can do about this?  I know the Smallies eat them up and must be getting fat but don't they do more damage than good like eating up eggs?"

1008194,mike rousseau,2017-07-04 16:50:00,4661,Gobies have been on the st Lawrence a while now and from what I can tell it's healthy as ever  If eggs survive they now have an unlimited slow moving food supply
