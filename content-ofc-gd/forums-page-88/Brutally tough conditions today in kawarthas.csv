1007350,Tjames09,2017-06-25 03:07:00,664,Water is about 3 degrees colder than a week ago water level looks up about 6 inches. And the water looks like mud. Can't see more than 6 inches in the river. Super windy today too. Needless to say couldn't get anything to bite. Between the wind and the zero water visibility.
1007352,Hank Jr,2017-06-25 10:57:00,146,Sounds like a tough day on the water . Which lake were you on ? I have a friend and his 3 sons heading to Buckhorn next week end for the yearly trip I hope the weather improves for them . Thanks for the report.

The sewage station by the boat ramp was flooded out on Friday am due to all the rain and yes it went into the river

The water was like mud, couldnt see anything. And really high, and also several degrees colder."
1007431,myot,2017-06-26 11:01:00,131,I put in 5h yesterday afternoon and did pretty well size wise but quite a few less bites than normal but did manage a handful of fish in the 3.5-4lbs range. Moving very very slow on inside weed edges  Dan

Yeah from the dam to the lake side (Sturgeon) had a warning posted in Friday because of the sewage and possible e.coli...  Now the rain did make it more murky than the sewage one would hope... http://www.thewolf.ca/syn/146/140739/rainfall-prompts-raw-sewage-leakage-into-lindsay-waterway?sc_ref=facebook"
