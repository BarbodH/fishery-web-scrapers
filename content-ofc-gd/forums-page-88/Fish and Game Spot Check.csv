No one has been offended to the point they sent a report or P.M. Most people who are approaching the edge of the rules of disrespect are backing off after I sent them a P.M. I will ask at this time to please tone down the insults and state your facts or opinions and respect the same of others. Any one who has been here should realize that post counts do not dictate if a thread stays open. If that was the case we would encourage people to rip into each other since bashing and insulting each other likes an audience. If at any time someone feels a thread is going wrong please send a report. Who sent it is no ones business and will not be disclosed. I read as many of the posts as I can but I have limited time and miss some, most of the  time it is a report that gets my attention and allows me to find the hot spots.  Lastly most of this thread is about your rights and it is important to protect them. The level of passion you have to protect them is dictated by your tolerance to paying the price of calling their bluff. If you think that a search is not warranted then make them get a warrant but you should not complain about the next step of waiting for a warrant. If you question a law office authority then expect his attitude to adjust to an escalated situation. It has nothing to do with being a sheep or a wolf it is rather deciding if this is a battle I believe in strong enough and want to stand my ground. If you stand your ground will it have any effect on the future of the issue being resolved you decide and react.. I spend at least a week in Canada in a popular tourist area and because my boat is easily seen by my ID as being out of country I get checked every time for correct papers ,equiptment and catch on the water. I have never questioned or given DNR a reason to detain me or denied them access because I agreed to the search when I bought my license.  Art"

The more people who don't understand the law and their charters rights and voluntarily allow LEO's to perform otherwise illegal searches, the more LEO's are going to feel they have the right to perform illegal searches. I have no issue at all with cooperating with LEO's but the fact that a single small infraction can and will lead to escalations in both attitude and further searches/detainment is why people need to understand their rights as Canadian citizens.  The single piece of fish, the empty beer can examples are all examples of people not exercising  their rights that have led to escalations. The comparison of a beer can in a boat versus being on a highway in a car has no bearing as the law is in regards to ""operation of a motor vehicle"". In the eyes of the law, a car, atv, boat, airplane are all the same.  Learn and exercise your rights. Be polite and respectful at all times and you will generally have positive experiences with any LEO that you encounter. If the LEO is an arse, you have recourse after any escalation provided you know your rights. If an LEO searches you without probable cause and does find something the likelihood of a conviction is very low."

Speaks to character and behaviour in the eyes of an LEO. Obviously someone at some point had open alcohol in that vehicle regardless of how you want to justify it.  If an LEO asks to look through my vehicle I simply ask them what was the reason you pulled me over for and what  are you looking for in regards to the reason you pulled me over. That ends the search request in a real polite manner. They cannot search you for anything not directly related to why you were stopped and they cannot stop you without probable cause. If you get pulled over for a moving violation and they ask you to look through your vehicle and you consent, anything is fair game at that point. If you get pulled over for a moving violation and they search your vehicle without your consent, anything they find will end up being inadmissible in court.  Feel free to not exercise your rights but you should know more than anyone based on your beer can experience,  it's not worth the aggravation and possible consequences to voluntarily allow an LEO  to search. You have to realise their only purpose of a search is to find a law infraction and charge you. They don't search to see what cool new lure you have or how nicely you vacuumed your vehicle out.

1007615,Glaucus,2017-06-28 05:29:00,48,"From the Canadian Shooting Sports lawyer Edward L. Burlew, L.L.B. CSSA Counselhttp://cssa-cila.org/legals/no-warrant-no-entry/The law presumes all searches and seizures to be a breach of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 8 which says:""Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.""The search and seizures will be upheld by a court only if the police have acted in strict compliance with the provisions of the Criminal Code as interpreted by the courts.When arrested the accused can be searched for evidence and for weapons. This is done to preserve evidence and for safety.If a person is arrested outside his home then the police cannot enter his home without a warrant.If a person runs into his home and the police are in hot pursuit then the police can follow him/her into the home and arrest. Then they may do a limited search of the persona and the area.If a person is arrested with a vehicle then the police may move the vehicle for safety and shall inventory the contents that are in sight. They cannot rip the car apart without a warrant and there must be reasonable grounds to believe evidence of an offense will be found.The Charter of Rights and Freedoms tells you in section 8: ""You have the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure"". What is ""unreasonable""? The Criminal Code provisions have from time to time been found to be unreasonable by the Supreme Court of Canada (R. v Feeney).The first step in ""what is unreasonable grounds"" to believe an offense has been committed. First the police must know that the law was broken. This eliminates random checks and routine stops and inspections. To arbitrarily stop any citizen and say ""I am searching you to find out if you possibly broke the law"" is the epitome of unreasonable search. The police cannot stop you and search your car or enter your home without knowing a law was broken and then having some real factual link to you and the broken law.When you are stopped ask: ""Why?"" The officer must tell you why. ""I am doing a routine check"" is not right or sufficient reason to stop you. Why does the officer believe you do not have a driver's license or insurance or a seat belt? He has no reason unless he knew of a real fact before he stopped you. Show him your license, insurance or buckled belt. Do not let him search the car. He will be looking inside for evidence of an offense. Keep your guns out of sight. He will be smelling for drugs or alcohol and if he ""smells"" either then he may arrest you for that and conduct a ""search incident to arrest"". But first he must have reasonable grounds to arrest. Police cannot go fishing or even deep trolling to find evidence without pre-existing reasonable grounds.Your home is your castle. You have a right to privacy in your dwelling. That can be a house, trailer, tent, log cabin, place of business, vehicle you sleep in, vehicle parked on your property. The police cannot enter upon the land or into any structure without a warrant. The only exception is where there are ""exigible grounds"". ""No warrant, No entry"" is a mantra you must remember. Exigible grounds is a fancy work for facts of hot pursuit from off your property onto them or outside your dwelling and into it, or if the officer believes that you may run away or destroy the evidence he/she is after. Otherwise without that the officer must obtain a warrant.The warrant must be specific as to who can enter, the time, place and what is to be searched for.You do not have to help the officer search. That would breach section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. C-68 says you must assist a firearms officer but that may be infringement of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and it needs judicial review of such a power.Consent Searches:Any person can at any time consent to the police searching themselves or any place. The question is why would you do that?Looking at the consent to search it must be a free choice free from any threats or inducements. The police cannot threaten or induce the person to give consent. The circumstances must always be reviewed.Also the court has to be clear as to who can give the consent to the police searching another person's house. Any owner of a property can consent to a search. The title of the property is important.The police will try to say you gave consent where they can reasonably believe you consent. The mere act of inviting the police into your house, office, vehicle is an implied consent. The police will start to search. If the police spot something offensive you will be arrested and then the search incident to arrest will begin. The point is to not ask the police to come in. Stand out in the rain and snow, with the neighbours watching and with your door closed.The scope of a consent is also important. If you clearly say ""search me"" that is your person, not your house. A consensual search of a garage is not the whole house. But how is this documented? By writing. Do not let the police make all the notes; you can do that too.Consent can be withdrawn. Tell the police to leave; the consent is over. They have to leave unless they have at that time found evidence of an offense and arrest you. Then they can continue with a search incident to arrest.If the police come in on a consent and ""find nothing"" or leave but really may have found ""reasonable grounds"" then they can use the evidence they saw to bolster the application to a judge for a search warrant. They can do that now or later; they can wait.  The Routine Stop And Search:This does not exist. The police cannot detain you without grounds. Period! That is a fundamental freedom. If you are stopped, the police must tell you why. If there is no evidence of an offense then you can keep going. If you are driving you have to show license, registration and insurance but you can do that without exiting the car or opening the window. On a RIDE check, you must stop and be checked but that is a short stop.Be sure though that the police will be giving the car a once-over with their eyes.Police Power To Enter:Criminal Code, Section 101(01)No warrant, if not a dwelling house, where a police officer believes on reasonable grounds that an offense is being or has been committed with respect to firearms or ammunition AND that evidence is likely to be found on a person or in a vehicle or any place other than a dwelling house AND by reason of exigent circumstances it is not practical to obtain a warrant THEN the police officer may search without warrant that person, vehicle or place.Note all of the pre-conditions:reasonable grounds, not a hope or suspicion, not fishing;not a dwelling house, ie house, apartment, tent, motorhome;evidence is likely to be found;exigent circumstances - hot pursuit;not practical to get a warrant - there are now telewarrants.Criminal Code, Section 487Section 487 of the Criminal Code provides for these warrants. The police must convince the court that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is in a building, receptacle or place evidence that an offense occurred or something that will be used in the commission of an offense. The police must go to court on an affidavit. If they have to they can do this by a telewarrant. This warrant is specific as to time, place, what is to be searched for and seize. These are always challenged in court.EDWARD L.

1007618,dave524,2017-06-28 10:34:00,4508," Section 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights states ""Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned."" which means that without suspicion of committing a crime you cannot be held.  Section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights states ""Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure."" which means that without suspicion of committing a crime you cannot be searched.  Your statement that an LEO has a right to check anything without reasonable grounds to suspect you of committing a crime is spreading misinformation and falsehoods.

1007630,grimsbylander,2017-06-28 12:15:00,3016,"The NEW and improved OFC Provincial Regulations:  i) CO's and Police Officers will only stop and search guilty offenders. Obviously, anyone with a OFC bumper stick is not guilty and will never be inconvenienced.  ii) Anyone towing a fishing boat can be stopped and inspected UNLESS there is no propeller on the boat, then it is obvious they did not fish from it or shore and should be left alone. We all know propellers are extremely difficult and time consuming to install.  iii) CO's and Police Officers should simply ask people if they'd been fishing. If the response is ""no"" then they must let them go immediately. After all, no one lies to Officers and after that it's just plain harassment.  iv) Officers can no longer set up inspection stations along well traveled routes used by fisherman and hunters. These techniques, though commonly used by hunters, are unfair when used by Officers. From now on, Officers will gear up in hip waders and walk the back country of Northern Ontario until they find guilty people, ask if they've been fishing and if they have a pocket full of trout, charge them. Hopefully this will not put to big a damper on their vacation time.  v) Inspections must be kept to an absolute minimum. Stats show that Canada is 1 or 2 away from becoming a full blown police state. In fact, Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes have already applied for Canadian citizenship in order to start living the Demolition Man lifestyle.  vi) Anyone caught wearing tinfoil and mumbling absurdities about search warrants, ""I'm not a criminal"", or ""Search my boat?? What is this North Korea??!!"" Will immediately be put back in the home and have their fishing and internet privileges suspended..at least until their regular cycle of SSRI's take affect.  vi) And...if you happen to live in one of the logic-based towns of Barrie or Grimsby, just shut up, you're disrupting the natural flow of paranoia.

One fish they didn't eat the last meal didn't have skin. Asked why not they said they couldn't eat all they prepared. Ok. Fine. So the search starts.  Every pack they had. Through the tent. Into the trucks. Down to the lake 100 yards away where the boats were. Into the boats. Under seats looking for an empty beer bottle.  Nothing to be found.

Two wardens (my assumption, could have been more) are wasting time looking for what could be poachers because of one piece of fish without skin? Wouldn't their resources be better spent looking for folks raping the resource with buckets of fish? Chasing folks in outta the way places only makes sense if there has been a tip given to the MNR. Looking for offenders in much more traveled areas, with a higher number of active fisherman seems to me to be the best use of their time and money. Any fine they do levy will be peanuts compared to the cost of them actively chasing out of the way fishermen. HH"

They can't stop you for an arbitrary reason and then decide to inspect you to ""fish"" for an offense.  Bear in mind, no law can supersede your charter rights. Your charter rights can not be infringed by the government or any law they enact. So once again fishermccann, an LEO does not have a ""right"" to stop you or inspect you without reasonable grounds to do so for a fish and wildlife violation. If you choose to voluntarily stop and voluntarily be searched, giving up your basic rights, that is your choice but you are not required by law to do so.  When I have passed a checkpoint with my boat I have never been chased or stopped. If I am chased and stopped and have to explain my right to not be arbitrarily detained or searched it will be a bad day for that officer."

Edit: reasonable grounds, if you really don't know is the some sort of evidence that you have violated a law. Does towing a boat seem like evidence that you have broken a law? That would be much akin to saying you may be a rapist because you have a tally-whacker. Doesn't work now does it?"

With nothing to hide, take the high road and perhaps offer tips on how you think they might nab more poachers.  Did you ask them if they have ever nabbed a poacher who didn't have gear, a battery or a prop installed on their boat?  Who knows, maybe the guy busted somebody who did exactly that a week before.  I suspect guilty parties have tried all sorts of stuff law abiding citizens could never imagine.

Do you know how many times these guys are probably lied to by people?  lol  I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't take your word for it.  Are you suggesting that it is likely that someone may remove their prop, batteries, and fishing equipment from their boat in order to trick a CO on a road side check in believing that they had not been fishing?"
1004562,Terry,2017-05-25 21:34:00,14456," Are you suggesting that it is likely that someone may remove their prop, batteries, and fishing equipment from their boat in order to trick a CO on a road side check in believing that they had not been fishing? oh good, i thought maybe it was just me that thought that"
1004563,grimsbylander,2017-05-25 21:35:00,3016,"yes they did not have the legal  right (probable cause) to search and or to continue searching my boat  Why not??? This was my point...I read your original post and as it's highlighted below, YOU ADMITTED TO GIVING THEM PERMISSION. Just like you have the right to say no, they have the right to have you sit on the side of the highway and wait for a warrant. And guess what, if it's not a dwelling and they believe waiting to search could jeopardize the investigation/evidence, they can search without a warrant!! So they did everything to the book...they asked...you said no...they said you'll have to wait for a warrant, and you said go ahead...YOUR words. So what's your beef and all this huffing and puffing about civil rights when you gave them permission?? Or maybe your story is complete Bull? Yeah, this is the most likely scenario. So for someone that obviously backed down because they were willing to get a warrant yet didn't have to, smart call on saving the .25 to call a lawyer...  Oh, and my guess is they weren't upset they didn't find anything, they were upset that some guy with less than a teaspoon of knowledge about civil rights, the Ontario Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, and the limitations of enforcement within the Act by CO's, thought he'd play Johnnie Cochran and waste valuable time and resources.  This has nothing to do with rights being disregarded.   I have seen it before and have been stopped a couple of times by them The one time was about this time of year and I was towing my bass boat home from winter storage. I had no prop on it no safety equipment. No rods no fishing stuff. Not even electronics. They asked if I had any fish I said no Then they asked if they could search. And I said no Then they said I would need to sit there until a warrant arrives to let them search I said you do understand I it would need to be in the water to have fish on it. And without batteries and rods and what not seems unlikely I would have fish. In the end I let them search. And they asked. If you had nothing to hide why would you not allowed us to search. I said. Because if it's my right to say no. Why would you expect me to say yes. They seemed upset they found nothing and sent me on my way"
1004565,Terry,2017-05-25 21:46:00,14456,"even if they got a search warrant , they would have to lie to the judge to get it i will say again probable cause they didnt have it to search they didnt have it for a warrant after a few seconds into the search they had to know there was now the boat was in the lake , they should have stopped so no probable cause   some people a sheep and are helping to walk us down to the butcher shop"

You'll get searched extra thoroughly. If they can, they'll nail you for little things that would otherwise have been overlooked.  Ask yourself this: Who would a judge side with ? The guy who refused to allow the CO's to do a routine roadside check, or the law enforcement officers conducting that check ?"

1004585,Rizzo,2017-05-25 22:46:00,4754,"I am surprised someone would refuse the search. You have nothing to hide, so why waste these guys time? They are simply trying to do a job to protect resources. As soon as you reject the search you act like you are guilty. If you got pulled over at a RIDE check, and you had nothing to drink, would you refuse the breathalyzer?  I can't understand the confrontational nature. I would just politely tell the guy ""go ahead"" and then I would have a polite chat while he is doing it. I would rather be 10 kms down the highway thinking ""what a nice that guy that CO was"" than be the confrontational guy who is now being given the gears and is still sitting at the checkpoint."

I can respect a guy for being willing to walk the mile, even if disagree with his reasoning.

For what it's worth though.  I have gotten away with lots of stuff by being polite and just got a warning

1004432,moxie,2017-05-25 01:37:00,1566, Public ramps are a great spot to check visitors but the unfortunate fact is that most poaching  is probably done by locals which is why presence and enforcement should take place at the source of the infractions.

Routine stops at key locations nabs poachers  I I'd like to see more on both ends.  About 10km from me, a few years ago, the DNR set up a semi permanent spot on a highway, they nabbed ALOT OF POACHERS.  If I remember correctly, which is up for debate lol, they set up all summer 2015, loman Minnesota.  The locals loved it, tourist not so much.  I think it even had a mandatory boat washing station to prevent invasive species"

WAY back in the mid 70's we were headed back from the Big Nip with a LOAD on of walleyes........the guys we spent the week with ran ahead of us and near our destination we decide to take a detour for some grub...... then next day or two later we heard from the other guys and how they got fined for a couple extra walleyes because of a bad count on their accounts.....and they wanted to know how we made out with our load on.......we had NO IDEA what they were talking about until they better explained themselves...............NEVER again did we venture that way again.

1004298,Musky Plug,2017-05-23 23:09:00,398,"I guess it's a good thing although I'd like to see more of them doing their job in the bush and on the water cause a fishing expedition on the side of the road is just that. A free for all infraction fest.  And for those that truly believe in the ""If you have nothing to hide or have done nothing wrong then you have nothing to worry about"" mantra. Give your heads a shake Numb Skulls. It's about privacy creep and conditioning you into giving it up without even flinching. If I've done nothing wrong, go get your warrant cause my freedom and rights are worth all the time in the world.   x3. I think it's a good thing that they were out, however like stated before how are you supposed to know to stop if it's not clearly posted. Perhaps some of the people didn't realize they had to pull in until they were past the exit/ where they were supposed to stop. I would have a problem if they pulled me over a demanded to go through my things without a warrant. Can the MNR detain someone long enough to obtain a warrant? I'm aware the 5-0 can. I understand that they're trying to nab poachers but like also said before they should be more organized in their methods imo."

And to add to the OP, my co-worker talked to me this morning and mentioned he seen this. Asked what it was all about. From what he described, I told him a check point for over limits/out of season fish or unsafe towing rigs. He also mentioned he seen the two trucks being looked over down from the check point.

Someone on the lake my parents live on was dragging a Sweedsaw (SP?) behind the boat to remove the weeds from the swimming area from the cottage he rents out.  I sent them pic's and a video from my cell.  They then called to confirm the address.  Then they called and told me the outcome.

Wow, guy tries to clear some weeds in front of his dock so his kids can swim and he gets fined for it? Ridiculous!  When we bought our place on Sturgeon there were a few weeds off our dock, 10 years later the weeds were so bad you had a hard time getting a boat through them. We finally had to pay almost $700.00 to get one of those weed harvester things in just to thin the weeds out. After that I bought a weed mill thing ($1650.00) that did a pretty good job of keeping the floating weeds out.  If I found out that someone had reported me for clearing some weeds in front of my dock so my kids/grand kids could swim I'd be pretty pissed!"

After all you have the equipment
1004377,DanD,2017-05-24 17:22:00,2223,"Two weeks ago, coming back from Gilford; the OPP were doing seat belt checks. They were hiding half way around the on-ramp to the 407, coming off of the 400? I thought for sure there was going to be a pile up; there had to be 50+ cars backed up onto the 400. IMO they were 100X more of a traffic hazard then anyone not wearing a seat belt.  Dan."

I do not believe that fact you are towing a boat is probable cause to search for fish If that's the case everyone with a penis should be checked every time someone is raped in the country. After all you have the equipment  What other criteria do you think they should use for spot checks?
1004381,BillM,2017-05-24 18:00:00,17367,"Oh shush, you wouldn't pull in either unless directed lol  Well yeah, if I didn't know to pull in I wouldn't pull in.  But it's not like I'd go all Vanishing Point on them either, lol!  If they wanna pull me over down the road, by all means."
1004382,AKRISONER,2017-05-24 18:25:00,5558,"Id like to clarify that this was not a blockade of any sorts. it was on the designated truck pull over areas where there is a full on ramp and off ramp divided off of the highway.  I also agree with the tinfoil hat sentiment. Ive been checked by the MNR many times and to be honest wish they checked me more. If you dont like the idea of you being checked, what do you propose they do?"

1004396,Familyfisherman,2017-05-24 20:39:00,188,"I was stopped on our way home at this checkpoint.  Honestly I drove by and as the original post stated had no idea if we were supposed to pull in or not.  The traffic was fairly steady and I actually couldn't have made it over to pull in if I'd wanted to since I was in the fast lane towing our boat.  Anyways, we were discussing if we should've pulled in or not and a truck with lights flashing pulled us over.  We made it over.  The CO who stopped us identified himself, asked for our licenses, asked where we'd been, if we had any fish, etc -- we had only one fish, cleaned by Steve, the owner at Chaudier Lodge.  Thankfully, he had left a piece of skin on as we're supposed to, so everything was fine.  He checked our livewells, the truck, etc.  I was happy to be stopped and glad to spend the 10 min making sure everything was fine. Now that I know they do this sort of thing I'll be more prepared next time and won't make them chase me down  He was pleasant, to the point, and imo did a fine job of a thorough check. Had we had anything we shouldn't we would have been caught I'd expect, so that sort of thing may really help people make a good decision who might otherwise just expect it won't matter to not keep proper limits, etc.  Yep, I'm fine with it."

1004218,4x4bassin,2017-05-23 15:02:00,1025,"While on my way home yesterday from a camping/fishing trip on the #400 just south of Parry Sound I seen a CO truck backed up into a rock cut with a sign in front of it stating that there was a spot check ahead . First reaction was did I just see what I saw and am I suppose to pull in and get checked . The check was in a rest spot just off the highway and it was quite the operation. From what I saw there were at least 5 CO trucks and a couple OPP cruisers involved . So as I approached I decided to carry on down the highway and not pull in . About a KM down the #400 there was two trucks pulled over with boats and a couple CO trucks parked behind them and the CO's were ripping these guys stuff apart on the side of the highway, I'm assuming they were suppose to pull in and the chase was on . Anyways , I have traveled this highway for along time and have never seen anything like this before so my question for the group here is who is suppose to pull into this spot check . Is it everyone who fishes or hunts that day or on previous days or is it vehicles towing boats . I wasn't towing a boat just a couple quads but there is no denying the fact I had been fishing for the last 5 days so was I suppose to pull in to get checked , I have no idea .  It was a welcoming sight to see this check but it has left me wondering !!!"
1004220,Terry,2017-05-23 15:20:00,14456,I have seen it before and have been stopped a couple of times by them The one time was about this time of year and I was towing my bass boat home from winter storage. I had no prop on it no safety equipment. No rods no fishing stuff. Not even electronics.  They asked if I had any fish I said no Then they asked if they could search. And I said no Then they said I would need to sit there until a warrant arrives to let them search I said you do understand I it would need to be in the water to have fish on it.  And without batteries and rods and what not seems unlikely I would have fish.  In the end I let them search.  And they asked.  If you had nothing to hide why would you not allowed us to search.  I said. Because if it's my right  to say no. Why would you expect me to say yes. They seemed upset they found nothing and sent me on my way

1004228,manitoubass2,2017-05-23 15:51:00,11391,Im certainly not opposed to it. Just make sure people know they have to pull over  In fact it's probably one of the best ways I can think of to catch poachers
1004229,OhioFisherman,2017-05-23 16:19:00,6623,"Good question, it seems to me that a spot check would require them to wave you in to be checked? The only place I have seen C/Os doing checks here is right at a boat ramp or marina.  They had checks for trucks here on highways, but the signage was different, all trucks must enter the rest area or weigh station, and they had a chase vehicle standing by in case you didn't.  Maybe those guys getting checked alongside the road blew off a wave in?"
1004231,grimsbylander,2017-05-23 16:31:00,3016,"They check as many as they can...there is no regulation or criteria that stipulates who should and shouldn't stop. Just like they can pick and choose who they stop of the ones that keep going. I imagine for those that stop, they get checked pretty quickly and get on their way. After all, it's an odds game and why would poachers stop?? Those that blow by might get checked more thoroughly and then there's those like yourself that don't get stopped at all. Just like the fish, they can't catch everyone. I guess the poachers have to be smarter and take an extra vehicle without a boat on the back???"

I am 100% for this type of event, i do wish the signage was clearer though. I had no idea what to do, it just said stop check ahead...it should have said ""IF YOU HAVE BEEN FISHING OR HUNTING, PULL IN FOR MNR STOP CHECK AHEAD""  glad to see the boys out though!"

If you were speeding and there was a radar trap ahead, do you think everyone would pull over and admit they were speeding?  Not likely.  If you had been drinking would you voluntarily drive into a ride check, I doubt it.
