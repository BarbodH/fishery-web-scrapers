He carried on asked my neigbour, and question him on the extra rod, the guy had not even made an effort to get it out of the water, them when asked for his Lic. he only had one up to 2014. As he was being written up the Party of 10 came back to their cars and left, I could only wonder why, it was a beautiful day"

1007887,John,2017-06-30 18:00:00,2956,I am seeing this more and more...Does MNR not have the ability to ask the 10 to stay where they are and check them after he wrote up the first guy?
