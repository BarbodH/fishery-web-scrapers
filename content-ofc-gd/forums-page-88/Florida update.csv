See the attached link for a report on an overnighter I took this past weekend in the glades. You may need to jump to the second page, since I posted the report as a reply rather than a new thread.  http://forums.floridasportsman.com/showthread.php?245622-Overnight-tent-camping-trip  I'm guessing things are in full swing in ontario at the moment. Hope you're all catching lots!  Tight lines,  Mob"
1007577,DRIFTER_016,2017-06-27 20:13:00,10439,Sounds like you had a great trip!!! The sun and heat are a killer though. Technical shirts/pants a buff and good hat really help. Can't wait for the next trip report.
