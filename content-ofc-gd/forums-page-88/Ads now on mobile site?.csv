1000546,scugpg,2017-04-16 18:44:00,1373,I see ads are now appearing on the mobile site. Really enjoyed not having this clutter things up while browsing on a phone here. Is this temporary or a change going fwd?  Thanks
1000547,leaf4,2017-04-16 18:47:00,2466,"Noticed them too.  Get off the wallet and donate to the running costs of the site and there would be no need for them, but as they state they minimize the amount of ads so as to pay for the costs associated with keeping this board going"
1000550,scugpg,2017-04-16 18:53:00,1373,Is that an option to get an ad free experience? It's slowing things down a lot and even playing video ads?!! This is a bad change especially if video ads are happening.
1000554,aplumma,2017-04-16 19:43:00,6896,Sorry but the site costs have made it necessary to start the mobile ads. We fought it for years but we are at Rock bottom meaning the owners have been funding the site to keep it on line. We are trying to keep the ads as unintrusive as we can. We have very poor recruitment of people going to our sponsors sites and this has in combination with the cost of Internet services been a year of negative income. We decided to not sacrifice our bandwidth and our security measures to keep the site safe. If you know of someone who would like to be a sponsor and advertise here please contact your favorite moderator /owner and we will follow up with them.  Thank you  Art
1000566,scugpg,2017-04-16 20:26:00,1373,I see. Many sites have an option to pay/donate for an ad free experience. Is that on the table for future implementation Art?  Thanks
1000573,leaf4,2017-04-16 21:00:00,2466,So if we click the ads on the top and bottom does it help even if we don't do anything past clicking?

1000584,manitoubass2,2017-04-16 22:08:00,11391,Lol
1000599,aplumma,2017-04-16 23:57:00,6896,We are going to see if this will get us in the black for now. I only ask you to click on ads that you have an interest in we do not want to rip off our sponsors. We are in discussion on a members plus thinggy to eliminate ads for members who wish to purchase that route. We will have to see what it would entail legally and if it would cause issues with the boards stability. Right now we have IT Chad working hard to try to stop some of our issues with bandwidth usage and server fees to make it so we can still offer a quality experience for all of us. I will keep you all posted as we go forward with the site improvments.  Art
1000681,scugpg,2017-04-17 14:55:00,1373,Thanks for the reply. This makes the mobile skin choppy at times even as I type this. Really brings down the experience of browsing or responding now. Can you at least turn off video playing ads?  Do keep us posted on an ad free/donate option.  Thanks
1000685,DanD,2017-04-17 15:32:00,2223,"I'm a sponsoring member on a few (Automotive) forums; which gives you some perks, like no adds, not having to have a host for posting pics ect. If this board goes that route and if it was relatively cheep; I wouldn't mind sponsoring here.  Dan."
1008003,scugpg,2017-07-02 12:07:00,1373,Just wanted to follow up on this item. Mods is there any eta to when a paid no ad type option would be available for members?
1008027,aplumma,2017-07-02 17:04:00,6896,At this time the premium no ad would cause more issues than it would be worth. We would almost have to create a mirror site and expand our bandwidth more than an reasonable cost could be given. The ads you see will be kept to a minimum and used to pay the bills the site incurs.  Thanks for the support of the site.   Art
