1007600,kickingfrog,2017-06-28 02:39:00,8333,"Nipissing is the lake I grew up fishing and I still get up there sometimes to fish but this was the first chance my son had to fish it. We had chunks of fishing around some other obligations from Friday afternoon until Sunday lunch.  All packed for 48 hours of fishing.   After the fact, this would be all the lures we'd need. Ryan's are on the left, mine on the right.  My brother caught all his bass on a zara super spook and his walleye on a bladebait.  First fish of the trip.   Ryan's first Nipissing fish, a smallmouth on a topwater.   It was tough fishing as he needs some help unhooking fish with trebles, so it seemed like every couple of minutes I was stopping to unhook, or take a photo. lol   My turn at the bass.   First eye of the trip, casting a cicada. Hit right at the surface as some mayflies where hatching. The bass were all over the mayflies as well.   Ryan was so focused on jigging that he didn't want to be in a photo.      Tucked in.   First fish of the second day.       Ryan making sure I knew how many fish he'd caught.   His first eye. On the jiggin rap.     We got rained on each time we went out. Our last morning was no different although just before it poured the already good action picked up and we all caught fish on consecutive casts before heading in for the last time.        If he can keep his fingers off the lens maybe I can keep fishing.   As the dark clouds came in Ryan switched to a pop-r in fire-tiger and nailed his biggest bass of the trip and it was time to head to the dock.   "
