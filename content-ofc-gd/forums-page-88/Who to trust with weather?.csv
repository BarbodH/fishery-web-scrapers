It missed a massive storm that ripped through the other weekend. And it was way off on rain for this weekend.  Anyone else?"
1008095,Freshtrax,2017-07-03 12:36:00,2215,It's hot humid with a chance of thundershowers. It's southern Ontario after all.  I use Wind finder and sailflow. But I'm more concerned about wind .
1008099,kickingfrog,2017-07-03 13:26:00,8333,"Environment Canada and the weather network and then sailflow thrown in when I'm on the water.  I find that some people have very little understanding of what they are being shown, or don't understand that the farther ahead you are looking in higher the likelihood that the forecast might be ""wrong"". Anything beyond a day of 2 and the probability really drops unless the systems are stable. Another issue a buddy ran into was his phone giving him a forecast for a city that was nowhere near where he was.  It's weather, we love to complain about it and it's one of the things that transcends demographics."
1008101,KLINKER,2017-07-03 13:47:00,256,Take the Canadian Power and sail weather coarse and do it yourself.
1008103,porkpie,2017-07-03 14:07:00,2521,I take a look at all of them and take a guess.  Sometimes I get burned.  They all have been off in their forecasts since I've been looking at apps or weather sites.

Called for SW and got dealt NW Saturday. Sunday was to be 3-6 km NW, arrived to white caps Sunday. Today was to be nil and well, it was from the west,then north, then south. All with in 4 hours.  Im not complaining, as I still find a way and spot to get out fishing.  They seem to add thunder storms to everyday. Not just them,but every radio station it seems. Covering their ass? LOL"
1008117,manitoubass2,2017-07-03 18:08:00,11391,"WU was my go to for years. In my area it's very accurate. Then last year it went to complete crap for some reason? It was waaa√†y off daily and I deleted it.  About 6 months ago I downloaded it again and it's on the mark like it was before?  Weird, but im happy it's working again"

LOL   This is what Ive been finding. Im less concerned if its 22 or 24 degrees outside. Im more concerned with wind, and its been really off. Last weekend was calling for low teens and when we went out a massive storm with sideways wind pulled through and white cap waves. Needless to say it was more than low teens wind, it was high 20s if not more."
1008125,manitoubass2,2017-07-03 19:09:00,11391,"The wind is way off on mine as we speak.  It's 0, with maybe a 2km/h gust  WU says 12km/h Southwest  Leaves on the trees aren't even flickering lol"

Thankfully they didn't fall on the camper or she'd  Im not sure if I've ever seen that much lightening?  Sinker, I bet ya got quite the show on LOTWs last night!!!!"
1008257,Brettiop,2017-07-05 17:03:00,279,"Never had a bad time trusting Sailflow.  I usually check a few sites before going out, but Sailflow has been the best by far."
1008258,GBW,2017-07-05 17:32:00,8460,"I'm old school, I use windows.  I look out them and see what I see.  Some times I even venture outside to see how hot/cold it is and get a feel for the wind."
1008263,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-05 18:19:00,937,I got burned by the weather the last 2 weeks.  Sometimes you just gotta go and hope the rain and wind don't mess up your fishing outings.

If it wasn't for Wiarton Willie and Farmer's Almanac I'd have no idea of hat to expect. But, then again, the Weather Networks doesn't seem to either!!"
