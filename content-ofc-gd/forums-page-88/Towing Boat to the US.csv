1007701,G.mech,2017-06-29 00:29:00,830,Just hoping some members can tell me what the process is to take my boat and tackle across the land border to the US and back.  I've entered by water lots of times but never crossed at the bridge.  Planning to cross and Windsor/Detroit for a week and returning there as well.  Not much on either the CBSA or USC&BP websites that I can find.  Thanks in advance...

1007705,mike rousseau,2017-06-29 01:29:00,4661,No issues  Just a few different questions
1007707,Alumacraft,2017-06-29 01:58:00,139,You'll need to find out what safety equipment your required to have for whatever state you'll be fishing in .
1007709,grimsbylander,2017-06-29 02:18:00,3016,Take your ownership papers for the boat...that's it.
1007717,G.mech,2017-06-29 10:39:00,830,"Thanks guys, I kind of figured it would be harder than that....maybe I'm just getting cynical in my old age."
1007720,Garnet,2017-06-29 10:50:00,2056,Most States require a throw cushion. Square white seat cushion.  I kept mine and tied that floating rope we need to the cushion the states need to have something that might work.
1007759,RangerGuy,2017-06-29 17:17:00,564,"We towed ours in the states last fall, no issues at the border or coming home. You just have to have all the ownership papers with you."
