1007620,Hank Jr,2017-06-28 11:02:00,146,Hi Guys I have a friend and his family going to Nosbonsing for several days in 2 weeks .  I never fished it . He really would like to see a couple Muskies but will be fishing for Bass and Walleyes with his kids . He is staying at Big Moose camp if that helps . Any tips on the lake or to troll or cast for Muskies would be of help . If you want send me a PM I'll get the info to him .  Thanks for the help .

Just fish near or in the cabbage or in the pads.  If you want to target walleye, target main lake points in about 15-20 ft of water.  Good luck"
