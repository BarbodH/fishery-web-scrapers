For years , I have been using Jumper cable wire to connect the 12V Deep cycle battery to my Trolling motor.  I was reading that I should use 6Awg wire for 24V system. I believe some Jumper cable wire are around 8AWG.  How do I determine the gauge thickness on a Jumper Cable?"
1007510,dheitzner,2017-06-27 12:23:00,314,"I bought an 18"" battery jumper cable from a battery shop: no issues. I'd imagine you could buy a short length of 6Awg and the end pieces (to hook onto the battery) for a few bucks if you wanted to do it yourself."

1007578,aplumma,2017-06-27 20:50:00,6896,"Marine Grade: There are several types of ""Marine"" wire.  It's usually rated for a higher temperature and ""wet"" (think submersed) applications. it is also has a requirement that it be ""self-extinguishing"".  That is extremely important on a boat in the middle of nowhere. SGT-M is SGT battery cable rated for marine use and is only a little more expensive than SGT.  Some  marine grade wire is ""tinned"" (plated) to help reduce corrosion and has a high strand count like welding cable.  it can get very expensive (twice as much).   If your boat catches fire and you go for a insurance claim it will be denied even if you use 6 gauge wire and it does not have the  (M) rating for marine on it.  Art"
1007609,BillM,2017-06-28 03:45:00,17367,I've always used a jumper cable with some crimped ends on them in our 24V setup..  Never a problem.

1007670,NANUK,2017-06-28 20:00:00,797,"Jumper/booster cables will do the job, but it's not the proper choice, Most jumper cables now are made out of copper clad Aluminum ( read the box ), only designed to give a momentary boost, and save money,  not good for prolonged load application like trolling motor etc, I don't even trust them as booster cables, I would use a proper marine grade cable of correct gauge for the trolling motor."
1007672,Sinker,2017-06-28 20:13:00,8692,"Yup, just go get the right cable. Any automotive/battery/marine shop will have it. Probably cheaper than booster cables too. Look in the car audio section."

1007711,Pikeslayer,2017-06-29 02:53:00,1443,The whole concept of using jumper cables as a permanent solution is a little too redneck for me And I've been known to incorporate some redneck temporary fixes from time to time
1008037,kenzy31,2017-07-02 18:34:00,261,"Car audio 8G power wire. $2 per foot here in Barrie for the nice soft, good quality stuff. The previous post about jumper cables being copper clad aluminum is spot on. And more expensive! lol I just wired up a new Motorguide and glad I went this route. Thanks to the members here for the help in battery choice too, I'm very pleased I came here for advice"
