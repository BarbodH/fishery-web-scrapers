1007504,John Bacon,2017-06-27 03:43:00,3277,Cannon cancelled my order for a Cannon clamp-on rod holder.  I still see some on their site; but they are priced at over $300.  I do see a reasonably priced on on the https://www.fishntech.com/site.  It looks legit; but I am hoping someone who has dealt with them can confirm.   https://www.fishntech.com/cn_single_axis.html

1007508,Garnet,2017-06-27 10:05:00,2056,I've order from them out of Quebec lots of good stuff no issues.
1007536,Lape0019,2017-06-27 15:09:00,647,Fishntec is a great store to deal with. They also know what they are talking about with almost all of the products they carry.

I found the product in the US, of course but these guys were the Canadian dealers that how I found the site.  No issues.  I used credit rather than pay pal.  They send it out in mail and it was lot cheaper than paying US exchange rates."
