1007603,ch312,2017-06-28 03:11:00,1590,"Hi All,  Thank you so much for the info! I would love to do the concrete myself, but I'm not confident I will get the foundations walls correct. With the restrictions on our property, I'm not allowed to change the grade, so that means the foundation wall at the back & one side will be exposed where the pad meets it. I've been told by the only person I could get to come out and look I should do 10"" walls with rebar because of the force these 2 walls will be holding. They will be about 2' above grade where the floor will be.  With that said..I may end up having to do myself as I am having a terrible time getting anybody to do it!  Some foundations with irregular shapes and changes in elevation can be complicated, but yours will be a simple rectangle with door cutouts. If you choose to do this on your own, most places that rent forms will give you a forming plan which shows exactly how to form the walls. Just give them the dimensions and they'll figure it out for you and send you everything you need.  I doubt you need reinforced 10"" walls with the highest elevation being only 2' above grade. Your local inspector will tell you exactly what you need as each site/project has specific requirements."
1007236,RangerGuy,2017-06-23 14:04:00,564,"Hi All,  If you have built a garage close to my size 24' X 34' or know this kind of work. What would you expect the full concrete job to cost roughly, this would include excavation, footings and foundation wall  & floor to cost?  I can't believe the issues were having finding a contractor!! I've called between 5-10 companies..no body is willing to do the entire job if at all UGH!"
1007238,Dara,2017-06-23 14:13:00,3052,"First off, where are you  What kind of ground  I can't see needing actual footings, just thickened slab around the edges with a couple runs of rebar  Lay out your pad. Make sure it is high enough that water does not flow in after its poured  Hire somebody to excavate  Hire somebody to form pour and finish  decide if you want drains...drains are nice. Here we are allowed to let them just flow out onto ground in our yard but not towards neighbors  Rough guess for a pad that size with decent access for trucks 20-25 thousand  I built a 24x26 a few years ago...cost me 25 all in with heat insul power and drywall"
1007241,RangerGuy,2017-06-23 14:25:00,564,"Hi Dara,  We are in Richmond Hill, I do believe we need footings and foundation wall because of the grade of the location of the ""Shed"", and it's the only place on the property we are allowed to build it. Access is not an issues as we have no fencing and it's at the end of our drive way"
1007244,G.mech,2017-06-23 14:54:00,830,"If you plan to get a permit and adhere to the Ontario Building Code, floating slabs are only permitted on buildings under 50 sq m (538 sq. ft), you will need a full foundation for your building.  Drains in garages in this province are also a no-no in many cases depending on local by-laws.  Not too many contractors want to do design/builds anymore so you may have to get somebody to do some drawings & apply for permit then you may have more luck.  Here is a link to a garage design guide that may help, most of the cities have a similar thingy on their building department websites:  https://www.oshawa.ca/residents/resources/shed_and_garage_construction_guide.pdf"

1007264,ch312,2017-06-23 18:41:00,1590,"I should be able to save some money, as I'm doing all the carpentry work, just need someone in the know to do the concrete, excavating, grading etc.  If you're a carpenter you could easily handle pouring the footings and foundation (rent wall forms) to save a big chunk there. Pay someone to excavate, you form and pour the footings and walls, rent a skid steer and diesel plate tamper to back fill and prep base, pay someone to pour the slab. This is a very simple process and the majority of the cost is labor. Send me a PM if you want to attempt this and I can guide you step by step.   Rough estimate for material:  5' x 8"" wall = 11 m 20"" x 6"" footing = 3 m 34' x 24' 5"" slab = 10 m or 11.5 m for 6"" depth  24 m concrete x $180/m = $4300  Everyone pays a different price depending on who you are. Homeowners can pay up to $220/m while high volume contractors pay as little as $130/m.  Gravel = $750-1500 with many factors coming into play  Rebar/heavy gauge mesh = $5-600    Material cost really isn't what you're paying for and you can save thousands doing some of the work yourself. If I were to do this for myself or family I would only be looking at roughly $6k, including machine rental. There's a reason many contractors have nice trucks and equipment."

Exactly. Rent a rotary laser to prep and pour the footings then it's as simple as building a rectangle with the wall forms, bracing, adding a couple pieces of lumber for the door cutouts, floating it all level, and adding anchors. Forming the footings and walls is a one man job and pouring them is a two man (or husband and wife) job.  Just leave the slab to the professionals."

Engine hoisting, boat hoisting...etc.  The foundation will (should) be his ""curbs"" as the slab will be poured independently from the walls. Whoever does the work will simply take the existing grading into account along with what the home owner wants to determine what height the foundation needs to be. It's best to pour the walls so the highest surrounding soil grading is at least 12"" below the top of the foundation, much like you typically see on houses where the foundation is 12-24"" above grade. This protects your exterior cladding (siding, brick, board and batten, etc) from splashing rain, drifting/melting snow, etc and results in the slab (floor) being well below the top of the foundation.  The taller foundation does cost more, but you'll also be using less lumber, insulation, drywall, exterior cladding, etc so it can actually be cheaper in the long run, along with being an overall better idea, to go with the taller foundation."

I believe code calls for the top course to be filled solid, but it's a good idea to fill all cores with core fill/grout or concrete.  For someone with no masonry experience, it'll be much quicker to rent wall forms and pour the walls. I have even seen people use 5/8"" plywood and 2x4's to build forms, spray with form oil/release to ensure plywood is not damaged while stripping forms, and use that same plywood and lumber for framing and sheeting their garage. Just be sure to use screws. Use the 2x6's from forming the footings during the framing process too."
