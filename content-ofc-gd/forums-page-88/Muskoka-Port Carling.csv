I've only ever fished near the cottage in Bala Bay and have hooking into a few bass and pan fish but nothing big.... definitely no pike, walleye or lake trout.  The next time I head up I want to explore more into the other connecting lakes (i.e. must be accessible from Bala with boat in water).  The three main ones being Lake Muskoka, Lake Joseph, and Lake Rosseau.  Is there one lake that has a much better fishery than another?  I see a few fishing shows that have targeted Lake Joseph for pike and smallmouth so is that generally considered the best lake in the area?"
1007908,Rizzo,2017-06-30 21:58:00,4754,"not sure which is the best as I have only fished L Muskoka. We have had no trouble catching pike there, some a pretty good size."
1007918,Pikeslayer,2017-06-30 23:12:00,1443,"Those are all fair sized bodies of water with many islands, numerous points of land, bays & inlets to target pike and most of all to lose orientation.  Be sure you have a map/compass combo or reliable GPS. it's very easy to get lost on those bodies of water."
