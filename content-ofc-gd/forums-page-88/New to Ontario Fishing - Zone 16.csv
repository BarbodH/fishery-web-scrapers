1007458,grimsbylander,2017-06-26 19:23:00,3016,"Depends on the body of water too. Some lakes are fun because they have big numbers of 1.5-2lb fish to keep you busy. A couple weeks ago on Erie, I fished for 3 hours and only caught 7 fish...but nothing under 4 lbs and the best would have been a tick over 6lbs. That's great, just not for kids or the impatient. Oh, and I  was 2 or 3 kilometers from shore so obviously not for shore fisherman."
1007462,Acountdeleted,2017-06-26 19:58:00,2562,Psh - I can cast that far.
1007463,manitoubass2,2017-06-26 20:04:00,11391,1lb test Berkley nanofil ???
1007464,manitoubass2,2017-06-26 20:09:00,11391,"My honey hole is fricken sweet!  25 bass is a bad day  But, it changes with water Conditions/flow etc. It's best in summer and fall  Summer is wicked for numbers, but fall is for the fatties.  Keep in mind when I say 25 is a bad day, that's on a 6-7 hour day. I've caught over 100 lotsa times but im down there with food, drinks, fire etc. I might fish 15 hours to get a 100 fish. Lotsa people shore fishing might only fish a few hours  Ask GBW, one day I was fishing tubes for the first time. We were chatting on the phone and im not sure on the number??? But I think I caught like 13 bass in maybe 15 casts lol  Damn I love that spot though!"

1007548,Acountdeleted,2017-06-27 16:39:00,2562,Yeah bud. The 25 was in about 2 hours. Gf and sister don't have the patience. So numbers ovef size. This was also before the storm.
1007549,manitoubass2,2017-06-27 17:00:00,11391, I betcha it would hold some big fish come fall!
1007564,Acountdeleted,2017-06-27 18:42:00,2562, I'm also told I missed out. This spring with the water high I was told it was holding some monster walleye and muskie before the water temps warmed up.
1007566,manitoubass2,2017-06-27 18:46:00,11391,"Ughhh bummer  My spot gets wicked end of summer for pike too, then walleye in the fall. No wallies in summer though, just sauger"
1007154,Zathorious,2017-06-22 03:47:00,9,"Hi Guys,  New to fishing in Ontario.  I'm looking to go Friday for bass in Zone 16 is the only zone that's open until Saturday.  I just bought the gear and licenses for my girlfriend and me, I thought it would be a good thing to do together as she's shown interest. I was hoping someone could suggest a spot where we're almost guaranteed to catch some Bass, we're looking to eat them as well. I want to get her hooked on it, she's quite the catch (pun intended).  Many thanks, Oliver  "
1007155,adempsey,2017-06-22 03:58:00,1498,From shore?
1007156,Zathorious,2017-06-22 04:02:00,9,"From shore?   Yes Sir, if we really get into it, we'll look at getting a boat."
1007162,wkimwes,2017-06-22 11:10:00,76,Guaranteed numbers would be nearly impossible to guarantee..especially from shore.  Only way I can say you can guarantee would be a private pond with no pressure.
1007175,Acountdeleted,2017-06-22 15:51:00,2562,Hello friend. My best bet I can tell you is to go to Heart lake in Brampton or island lake in Orangeville. Rent a boat from the conservation authorities and explore the lakes. The rental prices are reasonable and the fishing can be good with a little luck.  Have a good opening weekend.
1007190,AKRISONER,2017-06-22 19:40:00,5558,Hello friend. My best bet I can tell you is to go to Heart lake in Brampton or island lake in Orangeville.  eating largies outta heart or island lake...passssssssss
1007193,Acountdeleted,2017-06-22 20:19:00,2562,2 outta 3 ain't bad.
1007194,GBW,2017-06-22 20:27:00,8460,she may have more fun perch or crappie fishing and those are much better eat's than bass in my eye's (and taste buds)
1007195,misfish,2017-06-22 20:29:00,29133,16 opens Saturday. You say you are fishing friday?  Or did I misread?
1007197,manitoubass2,2017-06-22 21:50:00,11391,"Bass is way better than crappie lol (joking)  Very hard to find crappie from shore though  I've eaten 2 bass in my life, no thanks ill pass"

1007200,ckewley,2017-06-22 22:07:00,699,"Some decent fish can be caught in the river systems, or from piers,  just depends on where you live."
1007201,manitoubass2,2017-06-22 22:25:00,11391,"Yeah, I know alot of people that will keep them on the deep, colder lakes"

1007210,GBW,2017-06-23 00:59:00,8460,Go see Will at Curtis Point Cottages (a member here) and tell him you heard of them from this site.  And rent a boat as long as you have a valid boaters card.  If not see if he or others can guide you two for a bit.

1007221,wkimwes,2017-06-23 03:35:00,76,"Yes, even a trolling motor counts."
1007222,John Bacon,2017-06-23 03:46:00,3277," need a card to a rent a 9.9 tinner now?   Yes, even a trolling motor counts. No, you don't need a card to rent a boat.  But the renter must walk you through a safety check list.  But if you own your own boat, you will need the boaters card even for an electric motor.  To the OP:  I think all of the lakes around Peterborough have bass in them.  The Otonabe river is another option.  There are no guarantees though; fishing doesn't work that way."
1007230,FloatnFly,2017-06-23 12:06:00,1640,"  No, you don't need a card to rent a boat.  But the renter must walk you through a safety check list.

1007234,Canuck,2017-06-23 13:50:00,491,"A bit off topic, but I have never understood why the Gov't overseers would make me have to get a boaters card at 53 years old and basically 50 years of on the water boating experience, but a brand new person can rent a boat after 15 minutes of ""safety instruction"".  My boat is at Hindson in Penetang and there is a Diverse Rental there, so I see what goes on.  There are very inexperienced people renting their boats and heading out.  At least they tend to wear their life jackets.  As for bass, I won't eat a largemouth.  I find them a bit ""muddy"" tasting.  Not bad, just not good enough to kill a fish when there are other options.  I will eat smallmouth from Georgian Bay though, as long as it is in clean water and not in an area where they are too grubby.  On or two grubs I will cut out, but too many is just a bit ""icky"".  I wouldn't say they are as good as perch or walleye, but they are pretty good.  I also like to eat the odd pike.  About 3 to 5 lbs is a great size so the y-bones are larger and easier to avoid.  I don't cut them out, I leave em in and eat around them.  I think its a huge waste of a resource to kill a fish and then throw away 1/3 of it..  Larger and they all go back."
1007240,AKRISONER,2017-06-23 14:15:00,5558,"pops munches on the odd clearwater smallie outta gbay, says they taste no different than a perch. Cant say i dont believe him when all they eat are crawdads and shiners and basically never live near weeds."
