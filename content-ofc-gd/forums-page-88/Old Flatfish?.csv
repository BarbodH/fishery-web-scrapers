1007563,John Bacon,2017-06-27 18:37:00,3277,"Benos were made by Mill Run products in Cleveland Ohio a long time ago, they have been out of business for years I believe.

I remember seeing in Angler's Pride packaging.  I think they are completely gone now though.   Look like Beno Eels ? Correct.  Benos were available in straight, jointed, & eel versions."

That is possible John, they were located in what is now a bad neighborhood, and I don't know if they sold the business or just closed up. There were a lot of knock offs at one time of similar looking lures, as I recall even KMart had one, no idea who made it."
1007468,SirCranksalot,2017-06-26 20:41:00,3291,I just inherited these old lures. They look like an older version of Flatfish. Anybody see these before?
1007469,manitoubass2,2017-06-26 20:44:00,11391,...
1007470,kitch,2017-06-26 20:48:00,42,I believe the top one is a QuikFish  (not sure of spelling) and the middle one is a Beno which was made by Mill Run tackle.  Not sure of bottom one though.
1007471,Rodbender,2017-06-26 20:52:00,1027,Top one is a fire Plug lure jensen second a beno third not sure
1007473,Acountdeleted,2017-06-26 21:29:00,2562,Middle one is a Beno! My grandfather used to love those.
1007475,SirCranksalot,2017-06-26 21:40:00,3291,Thx for the info. guys. I haven't tried there yet so I don't know how different their action is compared to Flatfish. I have had good luck lately with lakers and splake on Flatfish.
1007481,kitch,2017-06-26 22:21:00,42,Fire plug is the name......it registered once I read that.  I have one in orange from years ago!
1007485,John Bacon,2017-06-26 22:58:00,3277,"I think the bottom one is a Reefer.As mentioned, the other two are Fire Plug and Beno.  I don't think Benos are made anymore; but I have had a lot of success with them."
1007487,smitty55,2017-06-27 00:23:00,928,"Top one is a fire Plug lure jensen second a beno third not sure Yep I agree. Can't see enough of the third one but it could be a brooks reefer, similar to the flatfish and beno.  Cheers"

1007489,Fisherman,2017-06-27 00:38:00,7201,Benos were great for Walleye and chrome Brooks Reefers were murder on salmon in the river abut 20 years ago.
1007490,dave524,2017-06-27 00:53:00,4508,"Of all the flatfish type lures I've definitely caught more Pickeral/Walleye on a Canadian Wiggler, I liked the jointed ones on Erie even fairly recently for offshore suspended fish, they handle speed better than the others."
1007494,SirCranksalot,2017-06-27 01:13:00,3291,"IMO, the CDN Wiggler is quite a different type of lure. It sinks where the Flatfish floats, so it's quite a deep diver and easier to cast. I troll FF over shallow areas where it might be stop and go. With a floater I don't have to worry about snags while stopped."

1007514,SirCranksalot,2017-06-27 12:49:00,3291,I understand that Benos are sinkers. All those posted are floaters  Somehow my pic got cropped at the bottom. Let's see if this works.   
1007523,Beans,2017-06-27 13:57:00,3339,Didn't the original flatfish have a couple of three pronged hooks (trebles) held on a wire that stuck out on both sides plus a treble on the tail ? Or am I thinking of a different lure ?
1007530,PUMP KNOWS,2017-06-27 14:58:00,937,Got any of these?  
1007531,SirCranksalot,2017-06-27 14:59:00,3291,Nope---what are they?
1007542,dave524,2017-06-27 15:57:00,4508,"Got any of these?   Lazy Ikes ??? another lure of the same genre.  edit: if I look through my old steelhead gear I think there is a few Ping-A-Tees too, another flatfish type lure."
1007543,Rodbender,2017-06-27 16:03:00,1027,Got any of these?   Look like Beno Eels ?

Or am I thinking of a different lure ?   I had in the 60's a Genuine Flatfish that had a spreader fore and aft for a total of 4 small trebles, the way the regs read back then it was illegal to have more than 3 trebles on a lure."
1007546,jimmer,2017-06-27 16:12:00,2730,"Wow, those sure bring back memories.  I had one of those fire plugs and caught a few walleye on it back in 70's, along with Beno's.  The Beno was one of my father's favourites."
1007554,SirCranksalot,2017-06-27 17:24:00,3291,Did the Benos sink or float?
1007555,Headhunter,2017-06-27 17:28:00,5703,Benos sank... HH
1007558,SirCranksalot,2017-06-27 17:43:00,3291,So mine is not a Beno---it floats.
