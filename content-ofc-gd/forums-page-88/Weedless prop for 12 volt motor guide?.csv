1007509,Phil 65,2017-06-27 11:18:00,37,I have I changed it to the  3 blade prop and it worked out great !
1007517,Sinker,2017-06-27 12:59:00,8692,Motorguide and weedless should never be used in the same sentence!  S.

1007647,Sinker,2017-06-28 13:11:00,8692,My boat came with a motorguide too. Best thing I ever did was get a minnkota. Night and day. I'm sure the newer MG are better....maybe.  S.
1007654,manjo39,2017-06-28 13:53:00,354,"Hi Tjames09, I'm just up the river from you it seems.  I went through the same things when I started (same questions I see you posting I went through). Extremely frustrating in our area as it gets chocked pretty good in the summer.  Felt like it was useless to fish largies with a 12 volt on my 18 foot Legend. I tried everything short of epoxying razor blades on the prop. The solution that worked for me is to go to a 24 volt.  I have no experience with motorguide, but the 24 volt Minnkota I can tell you works for me.  You still need to lift and clear matted veg once and a while from the shaft not prop."
1007657,Garnet,2017-06-28 15:09:00,2056,I see used min kota 24 and 36 volt 8-900.
1007677,Tjames09,2017-06-28 20:54:00,664,I see used min kota 24 and 36 volt 8-900.  where abouts?
1007702,Sour_Squirrel,2017-06-29 00:30:00,196,There's no such thing as a weedless prop for Motorguide trolling motors. Buy a Minn Kota !!

1007814,Henricus,2017-06-30 07:41:00,118,"Not all Motorguides are created equal.  The stock one on my boat was brutal and I went through every prop out there including the stock prop, machete and hydrilla hacker.  When the motor died I replaced a ""Pro"" model with a ""Tour"" model and the difference was night and day.  Any prop cut weeds no problem.  Btw, it's a 24 volt and I'm on upper Buckhorn which has no shortage of weeds."
1007821,Garnet,2017-06-30 10:47:00,2056,You can sharpen the leading edge of your prop will help a little. I use my yellow handle hook sharpening file. 12 volt just doesn't have the grunt.
1007833,grimsbylander,2017-06-30 12:36:00,3016,I have the Motorguide Tour 109lb....chops just fine. And I'm using a 3 blade because I fish big water mainly.
