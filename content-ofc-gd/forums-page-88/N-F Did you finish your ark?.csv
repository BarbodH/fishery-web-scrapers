1008031,misfish,2017-07-02 17:51:00,29133,"NO, but it just rained again! had great looking morning then it went south!  Rain the last 7 days at some point. This morning was real nice. Home in time to filet  out a pork roast, season  it up,roll it,rub it, tie it and on the BBQ it is ,as of 5 minutes ago. Will see it in about 3 hours time.  It can rain now til I awake in the morning, very early I might add, then it better be gone. I found a nice area with jumbo perch and the water is still cold enough to keep them.  Enjoy your day."
1008032,ketchenany,2017-07-02 18:01:00,3229,You have to come down soon and shop! never mind this fishing c rap!
1008035,OhioFisherman,2017-07-02 18:20:00,6623,No rain today! but it's in the forecast for Monday thru Friday! LOL
1008036,misfish,2017-07-02 18:22:00,29133,"I dont remember so much rain in a short period of time Paul. We have not had the drizzels, but down pours. Lake Simcoe is way up."
1008038,OhioFisherman,2017-07-02 18:35:00,6623,"We had a very wet summer 5 or so years back Brian, it may have set a record here, this one may be close, with plenty of time to go?  An inch of rain used to be a big deal here, now we seem to get 2-3-4 inches at a time. I can only imagine what some of our fishing spots look like!"
1008046,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-02 20:37:00,8243,"Where we are on the north shore of Erie it has rained 26 of 30 days in June. And I'm talking micro bursts and thunder not nice Summer sprinkes. Our gardens have never looked so lush. My Pomadora plants are 4' high with dozens of flowers and the dope plants are even bigger (Basil and Oregano). Last year my wife only cut the grass 5 times, today was the 11th cut of the year. I keep track for her fuel costs. There is still some first cuts of hay rotting in the fields out here, no way it will dry and condition it. In Holland Landing they are pumping out fields under 2 feet of water, I can't wait to see the cost of carrots and onions this year, actually anything."

A good year and the tilling and planting is done by mid may."
1008053,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-02 21:11:00,8243,It's crazy my Buckeye friend. I said in April here I think I saw Noah and his gaggle 2 by 2 floating by.

LOL, we got our tree seedling order in April, my son planted them and hasn't had to water them yet! The nesting duck in the middle of our normally dry field was a sign?"
