The kids were pumped about it and so I've been guilted into it.  I will have the boat with me to keep me occupied.  Any idea how the fishing is in the main lake nearby?  I've got a few riggers on a 17 1/2 foot deep v smokercraft.  Worth venturing out to rig if the winds cooperate?  Or should I stick nearby shore and hope for pike and walleye?  Any advice is appreciated. T"
