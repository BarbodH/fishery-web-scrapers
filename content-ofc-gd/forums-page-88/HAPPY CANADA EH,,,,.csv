1008153,manitoubass2,2017-07-03 22:48:00,11391,Great report and nice shooting Brian!  Looks like a great time was had
1008161,ketchenany,2017-07-04 00:57:00,3229,Time to retire the flips and go modern with leats say a Minkota. If you only use one flipper you'll be going in circles
1008185,aplumma,2017-07-04 13:39:00,6896,Nice trip Brian hopefully your foot heals quickly.  Art
1008210,misfish,2017-07-04 20:47:00,29133,"Thanks Fellas   Time to retire the flips and go modern with leats say a Minkota.If you only use one flipper you'll be going in circles  No going in circles bud. There is a knack to flipping the toon. I was still able to have enough motion with one flipper to drag a tube just at the right speed and straight.   I can turn that thing on a dime when I want. LOL  BTW  That kitty was about 3-4 inches long. I think he or she, thought I was mama. LOL I was going to scoop it up with my hands, but thought different. Im sure the little stingers were still sharp enough to give me a prick. It just stayed by my toon for about 10 minutes. Was very cool."

1008218,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-04 22:31:00,8243,"Nice report Brian and a nice feed. Sorry about the flipper injury. ICE it. Ice, compression and elevation. No big deal unless a bone is sticking out. Tape it up and get back in the huddle.  PS. Time to get a ""real"" boat and ditch the Flintstone Floatmobile? Ya ain't gettin' any younger boyo. And guess what? It gets exponentially worse every year, then every 6 months then every month, you get the formula.  Cooked up the last of some nice size Simcoe Perch. I coated them in crushed Miss Vickie's tater chips, really great. Don't add salt."
