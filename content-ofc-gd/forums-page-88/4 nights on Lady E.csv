1007268,Can_38,2017-06-23 18:57:00,152,Glad to hear you did well and great pics!
1007433,Sterling,2017-06-26 12:03:00,477,"Lady Evelyn is a beauty. Last time I was there the walleye were on fire, small and big.  Looks like you had some good times with dad, walleyes are just a bonus right .  I'm guessing you were in the western area of the lake, right?"
1007435,porkpie,2017-06-26 12:20:00,2521,Looks like a good time!  Some nice pics there.
1007441,Freshtrax,2017-06-26 14:26:00,2215,.
1007442,Freshtrax,2017-06-26 14:27:00,2215,Yep we camped in the West end nicer scenery and a little quieter.
1007461,paul sr.,2017-06-26 19:50:00,10,Great report and photos. we are headed to Lady E. this weekend July 1. Staying @ Red Pine Wilderness Lodge--housekeeping. Is that near your spot? I hope we have a luck(skill?) like you'all had. Getting psyched! Any body stay there willing to share thoughts/suggestions? Is worm and jig good enough and what is likely depth to explore?
1007474,Freshtrax,2017-06-26 21:32:00,2215,Bring minnows and leeches. We fished mostly in the western end of the lake. No clue in July where the fish will be I'm assuming in deeper holes.
1007492,irishfield,2017-06-27 01:00:00,26272,"Glad you had fun and found sun. It's been far and few between with it's rare showings the past month. Bugs are a plenty and tent caterpillars so bad you'd think you're in a Hitchcock movie!  Great outing with Dad Andrew, nice report to come home to and find to read!"
1006865,Freshtrax,2017-06-19 04:10:00,2215,Was up at lady E camping Monday to Friday last week. Bluebird days and super hot temps isn't what comes to mind for ideal walleye conditions we were concerned going in as neither of us are super accomplished walleye fisherman . Heck i have only caught about 100  in my life and dad even less.  We got our ass kicked during the day and we pounded them at night.   Our best night we figure we boated 800 inches of walleye.  average size up here was HUGE  we only caught 11 fish all week under 17.5  and biggest was 26.5.  most were 19-23.  had a great week exploring this awesome lake and cant wait to get back soon.   Best part was catching up with Dad as this was the longest ive ever spent with him just the two of us.   Happy Fathers Day everyone.   Heres the goods.                                                 
1006867,Old Ironmaker,2017-06-19 04:19:00,8243,Forgid aboud it. Priceless.
1006868,OhioFisherman,2017-06-19 04:23:00,6623,Cool! Glad you and your dad had a great time!
1006872,spincast,2017-06-19 09:07:00,3279,"Nice haul there Andrew.   You certainly got better weather, and fishing,  than we did where we were"
1006875,Chuck Enwinde,2017-06-19 09:40:00,247,Nice shootin' Andrew.  Looks like some good memories were made. And nice fire.

1006905,Rattletrap2,2017-06-19 15:49:00,1652,Very nice! Sure looks like you guys did alright during daylight hours as well! That place is beautiful. Is it easy to launch your own boat on that lake?
1006910,SirCranksalot,2017-06-19 16:25:00,3291,That second last pic looks like the inlet from Diamond. Anything in that outflow?
1006911,grimsbylander,2017-06-19 16:40:00,3016,Dad is smart and wears a PFD too! Put a auto-inflate on his xmas list!
1006916,manitoubass2,2017-06-19 18:26:00,11391,Sick!

1006934,misfish,2017-06-19 21:49:00,29133,I thought you were going to be roughing it this trip. LOL  Great time with your pop. NICE.
1006938,Pikeslayer,2017-06-19 22:24:00,1443,Happy to hear the weather & fish cooperated Andrew
1006953,Freshtrax,2017-06-20 00:39:00,2215,Ha he loves that shirt.  Even had to wash it in the lake so he could wear it home .   Launch at mowhats landing boat a mile or so upriver to the dam and there's a guy with a multibunk trailer that will lift ya over 25 bucks on the way out campsites suitable  for boat are hard we had to rope the boat  offshore in a cove as seen in one of the pics.  All walleye were caught after 5 pm it stays light out a fair while longer there right now.
