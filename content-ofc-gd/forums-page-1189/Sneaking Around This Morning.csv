88926,dsn,2007-06-28 19:42:00,1018,"I got up this morning and headed down to my usual hole. Since it wasn't as hot out today. I saw alot of activity going on. I think fish wake up before we do. Just look at all the activity ...   Carp where searching for me.   But I didn't really feel like feeding them this time. I don't know why but I wantted to take it easy. For some reason.. I fine these kinda shots are more relaxing. Sure it's great to be holding a big fish and snapping a shot. But to capture them in thier natural state for me is more gradifying.      More garbage.  I thought the below shot was kinda cool with the plants. Natural aquarium setting, look.    Gills were out playing chasing each other.         Underwater friendly community just like OFC at times.    There some kinda feeding frenzy here. I don't know what they were feeding on. And I couldn't make it out either.    This fish had his head in the dirt digging for food. Could have been easy prey if I had my rig ready to go. I would have snuck it right under his nose. Without him knowing til he took it. Thats how easy the morning fishing could have been.   More bubbles from the carp diggin up dirt. Bubbles where everywhere moving away into deeper water. Leaving a trail of smoke behind.      After looking at all the activity... I decided ok let fish for the small guys have some fun.  I have alot of these tiny jigs but never used them.  Maybe this would work. Nothing beats sight fishing at its easiest. I had a sunfish hit a spit the thing so fast I couldn't even set the hook. He never went for it the second time after he discovered what it was. Should I have used scent on these tiny jigs? They don't seem to really go after them. Or they would spit the thing so fast. Does anyone use these here on OFC ?   But another fish took it!!    Then this little guy came out from no where and boom!! Can't remember when was the last time actually went for them on propose it's been many moons. The back drop really makes these fish stand out wow.  I'm amazed myself how these two pics turned out.    After this fish it was 12:30pm. People started to show up so I left, quietly. Hee Hee  dsn"

88946,Golfisher,2007-06-28 20:23:00,586,"The second-last shot, is that a bluegill or a pumkinseed?  I always get those two confused.  That fish is very colorful, almost tropical."
88947,urbanangler1990,2007-06-28 20:29:00,933,"its a pumpinseed i believe, bluegill are little less colorful,"
88948,1leggedangler,2007-06-28 20:30:00,364,"Wow!!!! Can't believe what I sleep through. Amazing pics thanks for posting.  Cheers, 1leg"
88951,joonmoon,2007-06-28 20:32:00,528,That's a Pumpkinseed sunfish. Yes very pretty and tropical looking. Nice morning to view nature at its finest. Here's a Bluey.  
88975,Uncle Buck,2007-06-28 21:19:00,1000," Yeah Baby, Try using the hot pink with silver sparkles one. it's KILLER!!  The ""Pink Panther"" has never let me down!!!"
88982,The Urban Fisherman,2007-06-28 21:34:00,2050,"sweet report! my go-to setup for sunfish is the pink trout worm!  i actually do a mini wakey rig with a tiny #10 hook and they smoke it every time! i'll have to try those tiny-tubes someday!  I think those carp are chasing a female or something...I see it all the time in the spring, at the mouth of my carp creek.  They'll go right by you like you're not even there....must have ""something else"" on the mind....  thanks for the report  UF"
88999,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-28 22:16:00,0,Great Report. I also like the quality of the last two pictures. The colours really stand out!
89009,dsn,2007-06-28 22:45:00,1018,I'll try for blue gill tomorrow maybe. And try a different tube and see what happends. I'm saving those last two shots full size that for sure.    dsn
89028,motv8tr,2007-06-28 23:33:00,2587,"Wow, those are some amazing shots, I envy your camera work     As for those small tube jigs, I use them whenever going for panfish...  Maureen"
89043,mepps,2007-06-29 00:32:00,1301,great photos!
89046,007,2007-06-29 00:47:00,537,"Good job dsn.  I've used green/chartreuse microtubes on Cook's Bay and caught loads of pumpkinseedfish and perch.  One reason those bluegills and pumpkinseedfish didn't take them could be because they are still spawning.  When I was down at the Islands last weekend I watched them spawning and then cast baits to them - the majority of the times i dangled a bait in front of them they picked it up by one end, didn't swallow, swam 2ft from their nest and spat it out.  They just weren't interested (even in a bit of wriggling worm), all they were interested in was protecting their nest.  You took some good photos - is really good to see the fish in their natural habitat (though minus the cans and other garbage).  I would like to invest in a waterproof digital camera to try and takeshots underwater at some point.  Does your camera have a setting to reduce the glare of the water or do you have to use software afterwards to get the effect?  Either way it gets you interesting shots though a little surreal looking.  Unfortunately I won't be able to make it out to fish with you tomorrow due to work commitments.  If you're still going, good luck and I'll try and get out there with you for those monster carp at some point this summer.  007"
89056,Victor,2007-06-29 01:08:00,1609,Great shots dsn!  now that i can't get out much ... seeing these pics really ease off some pain lol.
89060,dsn,2007-06-29 01:10:00,1018,  My camera has no settings to reduce glare. I try to position myself at the right angle to get these shots and without casting a shadow on the subject too. Why didn't they invent a polarized lens that sqrews into the front of these digtals like the old 35 mmm SLR's ? Or designed all these digitals that can hold a polarized lens? Were they thinking?  And for the carpin next time then.  dsn
