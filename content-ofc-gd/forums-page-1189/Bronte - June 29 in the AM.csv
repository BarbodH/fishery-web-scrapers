89386,icefisherman,2007-06-29 17:30:00,952,"Started 6am in 80 fow. Got few and lost few on the spoon and the meat. Rigger down 50' with meat and slider with purple NK28 spoon. I was getting hits on both. Second rod was on dipsy 100' back on #3 with white fly/flasher. Got a solid hit on it but lost it half way. Got few more on the meat and the spoon and got out by 10am. All fish on the smaller side but it was good action. Ended up 5 for 7. Not bad for 4 hours of fishing. It was a bit windy out there and hard to keep the boat straight with the right speed. About 10 other boats were out. Spoke to two guys on the parking lot and they said the same - smaller fish about 2-3 per boat.  Now I have to decide where to fish on the long weekend. A bit late but am hoping to find a good camping/fishing spot within 2-3 hrs from the GTA. If someone knows of secret crown land spot please PM me as my wife wants to know where are we going for the holiday.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
