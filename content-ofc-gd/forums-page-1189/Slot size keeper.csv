89117,kennyman,2007-06-29 03:28:00,737,"Congrats first time dad(and mom). I bet that was the most incredible day of your life. It's hard to explain to anyone without kids, but as soon as the baby is born you know what you are here for. The bond is instant and lasting and life will never be the same for you. It's a good thing. Treasure every second of it. It goes fast."
