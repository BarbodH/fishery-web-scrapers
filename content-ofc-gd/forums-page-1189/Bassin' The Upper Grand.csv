88591,Rich,2007-06-27 21:55:00,3927,"My buddy Alex and I headed out on the upper grand to try for some smallmouth and walleye today. Well I rarely keep a bass but today I wanted to take some home. Didn't bring a camera out just our cell phones but i got a pic of big fish of the day right before she met the fillet knife, hegh hegh hegh!!  "
88605,bassman,2007-06-27 22:24:00,384,Nice bass!  I hope the elitists don't give you hard time for eating a bass.  Bon Appetit!
88606,evster,2007-06-27 22:28:00,367,Very nice bass!  Congrats!  Where abouts on the Grand were you fishing if you don't mind me asking?
88610,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-27 22:35:00,1351,very respectable sized fish! but i'm assuming with it being so large and old.. it wouldn't taste too good? perhaps 12-14 inch would be ideal i assume?
88612,Clampet,2007-06-27 22:37:00,1947,"Awww, I don't beleive he even went near it with a knife. BBR prolly gave it a proper send off ala catch and release! He's jest pullin' yer leg. "
88619,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-27 22:46:00,0,Nice bass!! Watch out for worms!
88634,Rich,2007-06-27 23:08:00,3927,"Well I just finished eating that bass and no worms, tasted great fried in a little Rich Crisp Â™  As for where I was fishing well it was near Cayuga. Tons of fish landed but few of respectable size.  Oh and the bait of the day was tubes."
88644,fishindevil,2007-06-27 23:21:00,6254,"Nice bass rich!!!!!!!,hope it tastes real good,what time is dinner....cheers"
88659,PatrickGG,2007-06-28 00:01:00,562,Tubes on the Grand will never let you down.
88664,jediangler,2007-06-28 00:12:00,1923,"Nice smallie Rich. Tubes rule up in this area of the Grand as well. Nothing tempts a smallie like a soft shelled crayfish, it's gotta be their favourite meal."
88669,Mike Pike,2007-06-28 00:28:00,1332,"Beauty Bass there Rich!  I was fishing down your way as well today and got into good numbers, just nothing as big as your 'big boy.'  Congratz."
88729,b2kptbo,2007-06-28 10:01:00,1505,Thats a beaut Rich...
88750,ccmtcanada,2007-06-28 12:05:00,7971,Great looking fish Rich!  I gotta find me a good bass spot nearby...they look like fun!
88786,kennyman,2007-06-28 13:54:00,737,"Nice fish. True to your name ""BigBassRich"". Yes we remember LOL. What were the colour of the tubes that worked best for you Rich.? I'm assuming the water was pretty murky,right?What's your choice of rigging?"
88809,Kirk,2007-06-28 15:29:00,347,"Good eating size bass, if you can handle a fillet knife and know how to cook, which it looks like you do, so congrats and bon apetit.  I've got a few bass and pickerel fillets waiting for me from friends and family, fried with canned mini potatoes..."
88810,Rich,2007-06-28 15:30:00,3927,Black w/blue fleck was working well yesterday. Just about any color we tossed caught fish though. Chartreuse was the least productive. The water had a slight stain but was surprisingly clear considering the area. The fish were sitting at a bend in the river where it got really shallow. Every fish I caught was right behind a rock shoal. They must have been stacked in there.
88823,Puckhead,2007-06-28 16:01:00,377,mmmmmm  Bass.....
88873,joonmoon,2007-06-28 17:35:00,528,"Nice work Rich, gotta luv the tubes. Pumpkinseed and smoke are my Grand favs."
88964,fishdawg,2007-06-28 21:03:00,912,nice bronzie Rich - nothing wrong with one for the pan at all
