89413,nautifish,2007-06-29 18:16:00,1416,"   lol    I know many yorkshire men jokes....lol    Bloke in a lift  A Yorkshireman walks into a building and gets into the lift. He presses the button for the fifth floor. At the second floor the most stunning woman he has ever seen gets into the lift and leans seductively against the wall.  The Yorkshireman doesn't know where to look and starts to get very nervous. The woman begins to unbutton her blouse and throws it on the floor. She then takes off her bra and throws it on the floor. At this stage the guy is getting very nervous.  Then she says: ""Make a woman out of me"".  He unbuttons his shirt, throws it on the floor and replies, ""Here, iron that."""
89438,HookNrelease,2007-06-29 19:05:00,85,"the funny thing is that from back home we all have jokes about some other part of the country, being from the North west myself, the one i always had to laugh at was,,,,,  what time is it when theres a pie on the mantle piece ?  summit to aight"
89509,JustinHoffman,2007-06-29 21:55:00,482,"Funny stuff, Nauti - I actually saw this a couple of months ago at my folks house. Brings back some good memories. My entire family is British, all from Hartlepool. I am the only Canadian, and it is just my Mom and Dad that live here now. All of my other relations still live in Hartlepool and Newcastle. I actually moved to England for two years straight out of college. Lived in a town called Hebden Bridge and also Heptonstall (West Yorkshire) for two years before returning back here to Canada. Loved that part of the country. Have some great memories of York, and it is still counted as one of my favourite cities...  Good Fishing, Justin"
