Will be pitching a tent and looking to rent a boat if I don't have my canoe by then.  As well, how long would it take to get there from Hamilton?"
89506,Lostchild,2007-06-29 21:42:00,153,It should take you anywhere from 3.5-6.0 hrs depending on times you leave from Hamilton and back to home. The Tumblehouse Lodge supplies camp permits and would probably be the only ones on the lake to rent boats. (not sure if they even do).
