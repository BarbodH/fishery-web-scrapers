88679,Chuck Best,2007-06-28 01:07:00,308,"It's $20 to park and $12 to launch at Innisfil Park,but there's a free one down beside Lake Simcoe Marina between the 4th and 5th off of Ewart Rd.,but you have to park 2 blocks away.Those are the closest 2 that I know off....TC and tight lines........."
88745,Mark Kulik,2007-06-28 11:55:00,348,"Just do what I did and move to Innisfil!  LOL , the fee is crazy for non, residence, at the free one in L.Simcoe Marine, watch where you park because, you will get a ticket.  Mark"
88813,lilkynan,2007-06-28 15:38:00,173,For non residents it is only $15 to park and launch in Innisville park this year
89402,JFR,2007-06-29 18:00:00,498," To set the record straight, this is straight from the Innisfil Parks & Rec by -law.  NON-RESIDENTS.     $20 per vehicle to gain park entrance,  $15.00 to launch.  = $35.00 per visit.   Kind of expensive for a family guy.  Second choice, move to Innisfil and get to use the park/ramp for freee  I remember when I went Salmon fishing in Lake O. I was forced to pay for parking the truck & trailer (2 separate tickets)  John"
