88575,uroldman,2007-06-27 21:15:00,4,I am looking for information to help me catch some largemouth bass. I am  a walleye fisherman and smallmouth bass on occasion. Don't know nothing about catching largemouth. I have booked a cabin in Sioux Narrows for 5 days in second week of August. Looking to catch a few largemouth for the first time. Any help is welcome.
88665,bassmaster4,2007-06-28 00:14:00,801,an intro would be nice and use topwaters near weedbeds or spinner baits
88694,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-28 01:53:00,2585,didnt knwo largies were that far north?  isnt soiux narrows nw ontario?
88758,uroldman,2007-06-28 12:29:00,4,"Yes, largemouth are quite plentiful around Sious Narrows and it is in Northwest Ontario. Since I live in Red Lake, Ontario, that is heading south for me. Each year at the KBI (Kenora Bass International ) ongoing bass tournament for last 15 or so years, many largemouth bass are caught and presented for weigh in. Although most of the bass are smallies, a substantial number of largemouth are included each year. I remember people like Guido and the Lidners having limits of largemouth while all the locals were catching smallies. I have given up bass tournaments since then, however fishing is still my passion as always. My wife and I would like to try this largemouth bass fishing as something different for us, always looking for new fishing experiences."

88782,BabyHerc,2007-06-28 13:42:00,285,And why does everyone need an introduction?  Whatever happened to asking a question and getting an answer?

88815,uroldman,2007-06-28 15:39:00,4,"Thanks for the info. I have some spinnerbaits, and lots of cranks, every size and color,  and some of those top water baits. How about meps spinners on a spinning rod."
88889,bassmaster4,2007-06-28 18:10:00,801,well i did give him an answer but if hes going to be a long term member on this board then we migth want to know a little bit about him...  not trying to start an arguement
88893,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-28 18:16:00,2585,thats cool i never knew largies made it that far north.  i would use senkos and 7 inch power worms for largies.  i do well fishing the weeds.  top water also works well but for me i tend to only catch them at night on top water.  Cheers!
88969,uroldman,2007-06-28 21:13:00,4,"Thanks for the suggestions. As a new member I was not sure that there was an intro nescessary, and where does it go. For those of you interested, I live in Red Lake, Northwest Ontario, high in tourist activity with 28 lodges based out of Red Lake, mining activity is high,(home of the famous Goldcorp), fishing and hunting is great out my back yard. We fish mostly for walleye in the summer, and several of us pursue lake trout in the winter months on snow machines. Work with Gary Roach's Mr. Walleye Inc for the last 15 yrs, as a member of the walleye team. I used to fish lots of  walleye tournaments, and KBI in Kenora. I have fished several tournaments in the US, mainly for charity, such as the camp confidence tournament in Minnesota. I hunt just about everything I can, including pheasants in Iowa, south Dakota, waterfowl in Manitoba, Deer and Moose in Red Lake, grouse, and hunt during Archery and Gun seasons. Hope that works as an intro, If you have any questions, I will try and answer them."
