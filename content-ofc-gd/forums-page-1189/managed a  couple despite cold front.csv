We did not have a ton of time on the water but after about 3 hours of nothing but a few small perch, my brother in law finally hooked into something worth taking a picture of and I finally hooked into a couple all with in about 20 min.  It's amazing how a fun half hour will keep you coming back for more and leave you with a smile on your face all the way home.  Hope everyone has a great time on the water this weekend.       "
