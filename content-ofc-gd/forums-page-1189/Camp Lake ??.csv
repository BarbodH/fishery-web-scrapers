88525,ccmtcanada,2007-06-27 19:05:00,7971,"A quick search on the net....  Camp Lake Fish: lake trout, brook trout Cottages: Yes  Camp lake is a small lake, remotely located north of Lake of Bays and the western edge of Algonquin Park. From Hwy 60 and Huntsville take Limberlost Road Route 8 north to Tasso Lake where the road turns south and heads to Camp Lake. This lake has several service roads to access most west and north sides of the lake. The lakes in this region tend to be colder and deeper which is more favorable for trout fishing. Flossie lake is actually connected to the north end of Camp Lake. http://www.experience-muskoka.com/camp_lake.html  Apparently there is a slot for them as well: Lake trout must be less than 40 cm (15.7 in.) or greater than 55 cm (21.7 in.) in length. Only one line may be used when angling through the ice. Source: Fishing Regulations  That's about all I could find...sorry I couldn't be of more help."
