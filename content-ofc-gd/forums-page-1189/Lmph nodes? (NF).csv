88622,bigbuck,2007-06-27 22:51:00,2449,Get your butt to the doctor right away!!! They could just be cysts or boils or they could be something a lot more sinister. Don't mess around with this.
88626,Clampet,2007-06-27 22:56:00,1947, ASAP! 
88627,Motorhead,2007-06-27 22:56:00,163,Urbanangler... I just let my girlfriend who is an RN read your post and she seconds Bigbuck`s diagnosis...  GO SEE A DOCTOR !!!!  It could be caused by the heat we`ve been having but why take any chances....  Go to a walk in clinic ASAP   Doug
88631,Roy,2007-06-27 23:02:00,13728,Yup...doc time....You have an infection.  Antis will fix it.
88633,ccmtcanada,2007-06-27 23:05:00,7971,Yep...head to a walk in clinic if your family doctor's office is already closed.  Chances are your body is just fighting something off...that's sort of what they do....part of your immune system.  Better get it checked...get some meds and then all will be good again.
88639,OhioFisherman,2007-06-27 23:15:00,6623,"Yep, Emergency room, family doctor, LOL even the nearest vet. Get it checked out!"

88648,OhioFisherman,2007-06-27 23:25:00,6623,"urban don`t panic, here is a site with some info  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003097.htm"
88649,urbanangler1990,2007-06-27 23:25:00,933,"hmm, ive had it for a few days, soo i dont think its very urgent, altho i will make an appointment tommorw"
88652,urbanangler1990,2007-06-27 23:28:00,933,"yep, i was looking at that site earlier, relaxed me a lil , lol"
88655,Roy,2007-06-27 23:36:00,13728, Don't get fixed Bud....every pet I've sent to get fixed has come back broken.
88667,007,2007-06-28 00:23:00,537,"Don't worry Urbanangler - Cliff is right lymph nodes swell up when you're body is fighting an infection or virus.  My wife had some recently after our last camping trip - the doc thought that she may have been bitten and the body's immune system was fighting back!  It took a few weeks for them to go down.  That said....It's worth getting a doc to look at it though asap if you're in pain. As Roy said, they will probably prescribe some antibiotics.  Keep well 007"
88678,Roy,2007-06-28 01:03:00,13728,"Urbanangler, folks might shoot me for this but this is how it really works. Your body gets invaded by some kind of infection. The white corpuscles attack this intruder with killer force and this happens everyday without us ever knowing about it. Sometimes, an attacker is either too strong or our bodies have been weakened through lack of sleep or whatever. When this happens, the whites attack but can't kill everything and simply imprison them (in the glands) to deal with them later. This almost always is dealt with by the whites without antibiotics.  If it persists, have it checked out."
88680,mikeymikey,2007-06-28 01:09:00,376,"appointment?  just goto walk in clinic.  oh,,, and when was the last time you washed? hehe .. just kidding."
88681,Crazyhook,2007-06-28 01:12:00,1154,hey man I had that problem on my neck a few motnhs ago. I went and got it checked out and the gave me some antibiotics... go and check it out and do not read the internet ( except for the advise here) for medical info it will freak you out. Go see a pro...
88703,urbanangler1990,2007-06-28 02:32:00,933,"Roy, thnx for the info,  thnx yall, best people are on OFC, great people here, thnx again  i will go to check it out tommorow"

88722,urbanangler1990,2007-06-28 05:12:00,933,"hey thnx RAF , my chin is high now! way to go ,thnx, what the heck post some crap like that"
88739,charlesn,2007-06-28 11:24:00,551,"Yo UA, I wouldn't take offense, it's from an Arnold movie (Kindergarten Cop).  It's not a toooomah.  Picture Arnold saying that to a five year old.  I'd go get it checked out asap though.  Doesn't sound very pleasant.  Charles"
88743,steve_paul,2007-06-28 11:34:00,658,"could be a lot of things UA, many probably just harmless as others have said - cysts, ingrown infected hair, blocked pore from deodorant, etc.  Best to get it checked and taken care of for the peace of mind. Let us know what you find out."
88921,urbanangler1990,2007-06-28 19:32:00,933,"seems like its getting better, less sore, and redness went down,  lol, about the arnold movie, i just dont take health things lightly, thats something that bothers me lol,"
