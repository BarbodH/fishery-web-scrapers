88804,fishnsled,2007-06-28 15:22:00,3520,We're back from Floodwood and what a great trip!    Fishing was slow but when you go from +35 down to -1 and you have a mayfly hatch going on what can you expect.   We did get fish everytime we went out and I've got a few good stories to tell that just made the trip.  I'm just waiting on a few pics to finish off the report and should have it up soon.  Great to see that everyone had a great time a Lakair.  It looks like we'll be flying in earlier next year so I should see you at Lakair in 2008.  In the meantime here's a pic of the cow moose and here twin calves that we saw while we were there.
