89359,RangerGuy,2007-06-29 16:17:00,564," Sorry you see it that way addy79. I don't think somebody that cares about being Canadian would stand on the 401 with a loaded weapon to get thier point across. I'm not being racists .. I don't care what thier race is.  That act is illegal and is a violent civil protest which should have been shut down as soon as possible as to protect the general public.  Here in Canada our laws do not/nor should they allow this sort of behavior dangerous acts no MATTER WHAT GROUP YOU ARE WITH!  Peacefully protest holding signs, voting etc are how to get your views heard. NOT LOADED FIREARMS!"
89360,largemouth,2007-06-29 16:17:00,112,"why is rangerguy a meathead for giving his honest opinion? Yes the choice of words were not the nicest but neither is the protest. If they break the law they should be punished according to the law regardless if their land was stolen or sold for beads and tobacco and alcohal hundreds of years ago. I don't understand the mentality of our natives these days, why cut off your nose to spite your face? Do they expect the average Canadian tax payer to be proud of them or support them? they are criminals because of their actions, not their heritage! IMO"
89361,addy79,2007-06-29 16:19:00,573,"""Hours later, the OPP issued an arrest warrant for charges of mischief against Mr. Brant, the Mohawk from the Tyendinaga reserve near Deseronto."" - Globe and Mail  they will get whats comig to nem for the blockade"
89300,charlesn,2007-06-29 15:13:00,551,"I don't think it is a race thing as much as just the average person (pawn) once again getting caught in a chess game/power struggle that is in the end all about money.  The truckers like to blockade traffic when diesel prices are high...  How does that make sense, I've got no input on what Petro Canada charges, yet I'm the one stuck in traffic.  Same with the teachers union when they want more money, use our kids as ammo.  Same with the TTC and OPSEU and any union that can utilize us as leverage for their ""cause"".  Us average people are always the victims of these ""negotiating"" tactics and it really sucks but it's become an accepted tactic and I don't think it is ever going away...  I feel for anyone affected by the blockades but hope that cooler heads prevail.  Charles"
89308,Stoty,2007-06-29 15:21:00,2910,"WELL said. I totally agree with you.  Like I said at the start, I agree with them protesting about their concerns, but I dont agree with how they are doing it, causing difficulties for the average person. The same with the teachers, truckers, and whoever else. if you have an issue, protest to the people who can make a difference (the gov't), DONT take it out of the person who has nothing to do with it!"
89319,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-29 15:33:00,1183,I was lied to and mislead in my younger years concerning Native peoples.  I personally do not know all of the issues.  I have experience (not much) in witnessing wrongs done to many people of all races and afflictions.  Yet I do have a soft spot for our Native peoples.  They at least are getting some attention and hopefully making a big enough impact.
89328,RangerGuy,2007-06-29 15:42:00,564,"Well, I was going to reply with this big thing. What's the point. I will say this though.  As far as I'm concerned it's a criminal offence and these people should have been given 2 options stand down or be shot. They are criminals who cares what your race is YOUR A CRIMINAL! You don't get to stand on the 401 with guns!  The whole lot should be thrown in jail for a very long time!   WHAT JOKE!"
89333,addy79,2007-06-29 15:47:00,573,"Case and Point....  Meatheads like Ranger Guy here wants to open fire on fellow canadians for blockin the highway!! your an idiot, shoot yourself if your that angry at the world"
89336,urbanangler1990,2007-06-29 15:51:00,933,oh uh
89338,pigeonfisher,2007-06-29 15:55:00,696,this will not end well...  Who will be put in the mod que this week?
89339,Stoty,2007-06-29 15:55:00,2910,"OK....so much for the ""not getting nasty"".  Admins....... I suggest locking this thread.  This is NOT what I wanted with this thread. Sad that a bunch of adults cant just talk/express themselves normally without getting all worked up."
89342,keram,2007-06-29 15:58:00,585,"Just a reminder:  Forum rules   Debate is encouraged, but please follow the basic guidelines of debate. No name calling. Back up your claims with proof. Don't get your knickers in a knot if someone disagrees. KEEP IT CIVIL!  Things that will not be tolerated. Flaming, baiting, name calling, prejudice, racism.........."
89347,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-29 16:01:00,1183,Such a fine line for some (myself included).  Rolling the tongue first really does work.
89356,Wes Bender,2007-06-29 16:08:00,105,"I agree, RangerGuy could have use a little tact in his post. But I agree with some of what he said. If I stood on the road with a gun. Should I go to jail? YES.  Now I don't know what is going on down there, but is it true? They were blocking the 401 with guns?"
89358,blaque,2007-06-29 16:14:00,2419,Yikes
