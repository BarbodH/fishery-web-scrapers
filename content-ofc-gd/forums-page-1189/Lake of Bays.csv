88940,John,2007-06-28 20:14:00,2956,"Hey Chris,  LOB's is a smallmouth and lake trout lake, almost exclusively. There are some rumours of pike in the Oxtongue River area, but I haven't seen any caught.  Dwight bay has a town dock and launch ramp. If you are boating watch the sandbar!"
88950,wallacio,2007-06-28 20:31:00,475,"Yep, Lake of Bays is primarily a Smallmouth and Lake Trout lake.    As John mentions, there are a few pike which enter the lake from various rivers and ajoining lakes but are not present in appreciable numbers.  Bass fishing can be tough if you don't know the lake well as most shorelines drop to deep depths very quickly.   Try to concentrate on typical smallmouth habitat (rock shoals, around docks etc) at depths of 12-20'.  Good luck!"
