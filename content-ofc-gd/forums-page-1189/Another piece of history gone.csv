When I was a young,n I dipped the net for smelts with my grandfather and pop.The nights are so clear still.Drunk,n fools trying to pull up 30 40 pounds of smelts and everyone having a great time,and so friendly. Fishing browns many years later,as clear as if it was yesturday. Sad day for the ones that spent many days, hours there,but I guess it,s for the good.I guess."
