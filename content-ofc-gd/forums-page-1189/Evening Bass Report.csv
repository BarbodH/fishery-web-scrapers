We headed out to a friends pond, however, we were only able to stay out for about 30 minutes as the bugs were soo bad. He managed to catch this nice bucket though amongst all the bugs  Getting attacked by bugs    Trophy shot    Nice little bucket    Enjoy..wish coulda caught some more but the bugs were unbearable.."
