However, I've been frustrated at my lack of walleye abilities. I would of thought I would of got a walleye strike by now even if I was just fishing for bass.  I'm usually using some worm or tube, sometimes on a jig. My question is, is there a lure that can catch all 3 fish (bass, muskie (small size) , walleye)?  I'm thinking of exclusively sticking to some sort of spinner baits this weekend in an attempt to land a walleye, or muskie if I'm lucky on top of numerous bass. Think this is a decent approach to try? Input would be very much appreciated, as well as any fishing knowledge about Pigeon Lake (I am in the north part, north of Big Island).  Fishing report will follow the weekend trip, credit and respect will be given to anyone who helps me land a walleye or muskie  Bull"
88931,Jay T,2007-06-28 19:49:00,282,"Go with the spinner bait, it will catch any of the above. White is always a good one, so is black and purple, switch up colors and see what works best. As for where on the lake, I don't know that lake at all.  Good luck"
88933,Bob Devine,2007-06-28 19:54:00,251,"Try tossing some ""hair jigs"" to weed edges. On a recent trip to the Kawartha's we did well in 6-14 FOW. We also caught bass and muskies on the jig too.  Good colours were, blk/red, blk/chrt and blk/org.  1/4 or 5-16 oz jigs.  Good luck, "
88934,Hellfish,2007-06-28 19:55:00,308,"I would try a finesse minnow drop shooting, around here the eyes wont touch white grubs or spinners just worms and finnesse minnows bass love em too musky maybe accidentally but u cant really count on a musky strike if fishing for bass most of the times it just kind of happens."
89007,little angler,2007-06-28 22:39:00,128,for bass i recommend frogs.

89030,FishFinder,2007-06-28 23:48:00,481,i wish my mepps black fury looked like that
89040,Roy,2007-06-29 00:05:00,13728,"You might want to ask Clive (Mepps),  POLITELY. if he could make you a few of HIS baits.....try that. Won't cost you more than store bought and you KNOW they'll be good baits."
89138,kennyman,2007-06-29 03:58:00,737,I'd agree with a spinner bait. I've caught three walleyes this year. Couldn't get them to hit on a crankbait???  Two were on a white spinnerbait and one was on a chug bug topwater. Go figure?
89141,Dutch,2007-06-29 04:05:00,831,"I would second some kind of in-line spinner.  As another option a 4"" Berkley power grub.  Another option - texas rigged plastic worm, right up to 7"".  Last two walleye I've seen caught on pigeon have come on a texas rigged worm."
89175,singingdog,2007-06-29 10:20:00,1047,"A black bucktail works well around here for all 3 species: green or orange belly. For walleye, it seems to help if you are in contact with the weeds pretty much all the time. Because I find them in the weeds, I don't use an inline very much."
