Pics of Wayne and Leah, looks like they were enjoying themselves.  Good pic of Chris's boat at the dock, it's is a awesome ride.  Where was Art trying to take his boat? hillclimbing?  Glad to see most of the pictures of you in the upright position, you must have rested up for this years gala event.   Thanks for sharing!  Whopper"
