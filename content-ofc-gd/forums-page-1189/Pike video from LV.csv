89017,Whopper,2007-06-28 23:07:00,2174,You did well Clive and yours lures run true!  Whopper
88262,mepps,2007-06-27 02:30:00,1301,Heres a video Jon put together with some highlights of my home made spinners.  I had to rebuild a lure after cutting it to make hook removal easier on a good size pike.  This lure caught 40+ inch pike beofre and after reconstruction!  
88266,Nemo,2007-06-27 02:47:00,727,Awesome video. Great idea to show how to build the bait.. You almost lost that rod though :0.  So did Jon get to fish or was he filming the whole time?  Thanks for sharing
88267,dodger1414,2007-06-27 02:49:00,44,extremely excellent video thanks for sharing...
88269,Dondorfish,2007-06-27 02:55:00,1000,Nicely done Mepps! We sure have alot of talented people on this board.  Nice pike at the end of the video. look forward to your next adventure!   Don
88272,solopaddler,2007-06-27 03:02:00,8605,Awesome . Got anymore? I'm stuck here at work 'till 6am  .
88322,1leggedangler,2007-06-27 11:22:00,364,"Wicked vid. Thanks for that. What were those pigs relating to? Weed beds or drop offs?  Cheers, 1leg"
88324,Roy,2007-06-27 11:57:00,13728,Great stuff Clive and Jon....as usual.
88330,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-27 12:07:00,957,Nice fishing and thanks for the video.   It also proves to Jim that you have all your fingers.  He really fell for your finger cutting report.
88331,mepps,2007-06-27 12:10:00,1301,"We took turns filming and fishing, sadly I messed up the video of Jons biggest fish  This video was jsut to show some of teh fish caught on my own lures.  Jon was using Mepps lures 99% of the time.  The next video wil have footage of both of us."
88335,Gerritt,2007-06-27 12:20:00,6129,Sweet Video brother! thanks for putting it together  Gerritt.
88337,Cookslav,2007-06-27 12:25:00,1457,Well done!  What a great way to capture such a good trip. And as Nemo said....That was a close call with your rod LOL
88340,ccmtcanada,2007-06-27 12:37:00,7971,Wow...awesome video!! Thanks for taking the effort to put it all together!!
88342,mepps,2007-06-27 12:41:00,1301,Anytime i reach overboard for a big fish i loosen my drag - in teh cold wters of LV you never know when those big pike are done fighting!
88358,TJQ,2007-06-27 13:09:00,7806,Nice video bud... that is a huge pike...   It gets tricky trying to land those big ones yourself...  well done!
88381,tbayboy,2007-06-27 14:13:00,1497,"Great vid guys, love the lure making details and of course watching you pull the monster in to the boat was great."
88597,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-27 22:07:00,0,Definately fun to watch! I like the lure modifying bit! And a nice Pike to boot at the end!!! The music was very unique.  Looking forward to the next vid!!!
88637,mepps,2007-06-27 23:14:00,1301,"Making a basic spinner bait is pretty easy (as you saw) it only when you start dressign them, and making big ones that it gets hard (and expensive)"
88674,Whopper,2007-06-28 00:52:00,2174,Well done Clive!
88675,mikeymikey,2007-06-28 00:55:00,376,"Thank you so much for such a kick ass video!  Hope to see more of your fishing videos!  I love how you are showing off your own lure aswell!  Very cool!  Thank you!   -------- and yeah,,, i thought someone was missing from the video."
88752,mepps,2007-06-28 12:10:00,1301,"Dont worry, there is lots of footage with Jon in it soon to come - we recorded well over 10 hours of footage on our trip!"
88759,douG,2007-06-28 12:30:00,2693,"Great video, Clive, and I'm liking the ska soundtrack too."
88795,kennyman,2007-06-28 14:10:00,737,"Keep those vids coming. Makes me want to start making my own lures too. I imagine there's some satisfaction that goes along with that. Nice gator too Clive. I'd like to hear more of what you're saying in the videos,although the music was cool. Thanks."
88907,John Glynn,2007-06-28 18:43:00,25,Great stuff Clive. Keep it coming
88927,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-28 19:43:00,2585,wow amazing video!  That last pike was huge!!!!  Cheers!
89014,mepps,2007-06-28 23:02:00,1301,"Sadly we dont have a very good mic system yet - and the cold winds really cover up the dialog unfortunetly.  We are trying to cut out the wind, and increse the rest of the volume, but its no easy task."
