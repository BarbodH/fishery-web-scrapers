88991,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-28 21:53:00,1351,"so, some may have known, i had some trouble last time when i went out and the motor wasn';tpumping gas. found out it was the tank problem. today i opened the tank and the line that draws the gas from the tank internally fell off! well more like erroded off or something. now it is lost in the sea of gas. luckily i have a spare merc tank! the one that broke off for me was a newer plastic quicksilver tank and  the back up is a 70s metal tank, but i was surprised that when i opened the old one up, the line that draws the gas is made of aluminum? and this newer one was of only cheap plastic...  i guess i'll be sticking to the spare/older one for now... or should i go find the replacement line for the ""broken"" tank?  where abouts should i find that and what is it actually called...? i'm guessing i should just ask the local marina.  and any guesses on the $$ for it.. \thanks"

89003,Lostchild,2007-06-28 22:28:00,153,Canadian Tire sells replacement lines and tanks. West Marine should also carry them.
