Going to be fishing nipissing 6 days straight.  have some family things to do as well but mostly this trip is about hitting the water.  the shad flies will be bad and the weather will be cool but im going to have a blast.  i will plan on posting reports while im up there.  Im pumped!!!!!!!!  Cheers!
