88828,snag,2007-06-28 16:09:00,1932,Here is a report I submitted:  MOOOOn river   Good luck.  P.S there is a large pike there that I lost. Please catch it.  Thanks
88838,Cast-Away,2007-06-28 16:23:00,790,"You will find that Smallmouth Bass are the most common fish along with Pike. Try to fish shoals, points and islands and stick to water that is over 10 feet deep this time of year if you are targeting the Smallies.  If you are only there for a bit over a day, you likely won't fish beyond Arnolds Bay where the resort is located, so ask the owner the best places to fish within a 2 mile area, otherwise you will spend alot of time trying different places for short periods of time, rather than spending alot of time on fewer places that are more productive.  Bring some worms and try still fishing for Bass. When you get bored, use perch patterned Rapala's to cast or troll. You will likely get Pike this way as well.  Good luck!"
88886,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-28 18:07:00,2585,in the 70 and 80 the moon used to produce walleye like the bay of qunite does now.  wish i was around back then!!!!!  its been a few years but the moon is a fish factory if you get on them the right time of year.  lots of smallies!  lots of pike and muskie. The record muskie came out of the moon. (blackstone harbour)  cheers!

88989,pameladallaire,2007-06-28 21:48:00,470,"The walleye were already being over fished in the 80's.  You have to go farther out for walleye but we used to catch musky, pike, bass very close to home.  Pam"
