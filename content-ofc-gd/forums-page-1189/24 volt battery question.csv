89420,FISHINGNUT,2007-06-29 18:31:00,253,I have a 24 volt bow mount trolling motor.I have noticed when I charge the batteries one is always alot lower than the other usually 70% and 30%  the batteries are the same make size and age is this normal. Shouldnt the draw be the same on both batteries.From the motor I run positive to one battery and negetive to the other battery then run a battery cable to the other pos and neg to complete the circiut .
89425,douG,2007-06-29 18:44:00,2693,"Do you disconnect them from the circuit to charge them?  If you have a 12 V charger, then you must charge them separately.  The situation you describe might happen if you try to charge 24V worth of batteries with a 12 v charger.  I noted that 70% and 30% only adds up to one whole battery."

If not, you have to charge both batteries seperate.  I believe Terry posted about this a week or so ago.  Hi ya douG.Hope alls well."
