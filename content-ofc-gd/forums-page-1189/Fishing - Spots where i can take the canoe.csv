89042,Dan668,2007-06-29 00:20:00,1120,looking to take the canoe out this weekend. Haven't used it much. Just wondering if anyone knows any good not so big/busy lakes that i could take a canoe into. Distance preferably under 2 1/2 hours from Toronto.  Thanks so much!
89064,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-29 01:25:00,1351,why dont you try toronto islands....
89091,jediangler,2007-06-29 02:26:00,1923,"Try Island lake in Orangeville or Guelph lake or Kelso if you don't want to see any gas burners. If that doesn't bother you try Puslinch, Belwood or Conestoga lakes."
89115,Dan668,2007-06-29 03:21:00,1120,no distance really doesn't matter
89123,kennyman,2007-06-29 03:34:00,737,In my area Valens and Mountsberg would both be decent choices. Otherwise you could hit the Grand River. It should be great anywhere south of Brantford. I'd avoid anywhere around Deseronto (BOQ) if I were you.
89271,Beans,2007-06-29 14:30:00,3339,"I've seen lots of people launch canoes and cartoppers into the river at Bradford (west side of bridge, south of hwy 11) then head on down to the mouth at Lake Simcoe (Cooks Bay)...  Should be safe as long as you don't venture out too far from shore..."
89287,addy79,2007-06-29 14:57:00,573,Google Earth - LIVE BY IT!  whenever i'm setting up a random canoe trip I log onto google earth and search for the moost promising looking spot within reasonable distance.
89355,xrap,2007-06-29 16:06:00,683,I've heard Brantford is a really great place to canoe although I have never been their but I have seen alot of people going down the river in Caledonia and thier is a alot of decent spots. Try casting spinners into the little pockets and the current. I've had alot of success just fishing from shore for smallies. And if you know where the holes are down thier you might wana try to jig around for walleye. Just be careful some spots are very shallow!! Good luck
