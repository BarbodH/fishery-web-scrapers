I'm away at college but I'm gonna be back in Barrie for the weekend, and I'd rather stay away from the Barrie marina.  Thanks for any responses.  Steve  EDIT- and by the way if anyone knows the ice has at least 4 inches and wants to venture out with me, let me know, always lookin for people to fish with."
