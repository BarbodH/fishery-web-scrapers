23539,SlowPoke,2007-01-17 21:07:00,2984,"There seems to be a significant amout of interest in poker with members of the forum. Some of the concerns have been playing online and playing for cash... that got me thinking.  If we have bad weather at Lakair, why not sit down at the lodge and have a game?  I contacted Leslie, she has no problem with us using the lodge provided it doesn't interfere with mealtimes.  Ideas that came to mind... No cash game, entry fee exchanged for chips 1 lure entry fee - new in package $10 value (or a combination of lures worth $10) Winner takes 60%, 2nd 30%, 3rd 10%  If there is enough interest we can discuss games (stud, draw, hold 'em... dealer calls, blinds etc.)  -Brian"

23556,Terry,2007-01-17 21:34:00,14456,"hey, a bunch of drunken fishermen..easy targets for a poker game oops I forgot that happens at Lakair, stays at lakair except their money"
23690,ccmtcanada,2007-01-18 02:34:00,7971,"If the weather is bad, I intend to be fishing....LOL.  Blyght and I fish in the snow, wind and rain in December...so rain and wind in June would be luxury for us...LOL"

23701,Carp,2007-01-18 02:48:00,1488, I'm sure there will be a few people out there even if the weather is bad. Lew will probably be one of them. Can't see him giving up fishing for a poker game. Sounds like a neat idea though.
23707,irishfield,2007-01-18 02:57:00,26272,Yes in all seriousness it is a good idea Brian. I'm sure a game could be easily put together in the lodge or one of the larger cottages one evening..or REALLY miserable day.
