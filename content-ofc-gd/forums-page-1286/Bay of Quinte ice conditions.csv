Maybe the year is not lost!!!!!!!"

Went to town this morning..to do some banking.. ...the TD at the bridge in Trenton at the mouth of the BOQ Saw ice covering the mouth of the river and north...but the Bay looked open. I havent fished the BOQ in winter, so I dont know how long it takes at all for good ice..But, I did drop into see Sam at Carra Outdoors in Belleville about some hunting gear and he told me it would be at least 2 weeks more with these frigid cons. If your regular down this way....PM me and let me know when you think any areas might be safe enuff...just up the street!"

23486,duber,2007-01-17 18:40:00,220,I just took a little stroll out on the ice.There is about 2 inches of realy bad ice on Big Bay close to shore.I don't think there would be that much further out.The ice formed when the wind was blowing so it is a real mess out there.Ice was cracking with every foot step.Definently a no-go for this weekend!Maybe next weekend.
