23688,ccmtcanada,2007-01-18 02:32:00,7971,Slippery?
23689,irishfield,2007-01-18 02:34:00,26272,Frozen over from aerial shots...but I don't believe it's safe.
23732,Carp,2007-01-18 04:54:00,1488,Be careful.  We wouldn't want to lose any brothers and sisters to thin ice.  Good luck when you finally do get out there.
23740,steverowbotham,2007-01-18 05:17:00,1800,"Man oh man oh man, I cannot wait for ice on cooch.  I cannot wait for ice anywhere.  I have so many places I wanna fish right now.  I'm not sure if my first Cooch trip this year will be pike or perch ??  I'll figure it out when the time comes I guess."
23753,misfish,2007-01-18 10:36:00,29133,"Couch just froze over.Like Wayne stated,the arieal shots showed that,with still some open spots.Another week folks,and the play grounds should be ready."

23767,aplumma,2007-01-18 12:28:00,6896,When you come home drunk at 1:00 am and you have forgot your wifes birthday again then the ice on cooch is thick enough.  Art
