23436,Fisherman,2007-01-17 16:00:00,7201,"Looks like ice conditions are good in North Bay, just got the confirmation from Rob Hyatt that we are good to go for this weekend in his on the ice huts."
23439,steverowbotham,2007-01-17 16:09:00,1800,couldnt ask for better news! bring on Mrs. Walleye !!
23500,irishfield,2007-01-17 19:18:00,26272,Drifter got cancelled for this weekends bungaloo on Nipp and is heading for Temagami instead. Wonder whom he was with that's playin it safe?
23501,steverowbotham,2007-01-17 19:21:00,1800,"Well I just heard from my operator (Grumpy Fishermen) that there is about 8 inches right now, and that we will be a go for our weekend.  You gotta remember though, that the bungalows weigh a lot more than a day hut, so thats probably why they were cancelled."
23507,Raf,2007-01-17 19:31:00,3495,see ya there fisherman.. we'll be next door w/a different outfitter but if Mr. Hyatt's good to go I suspect we will be as well.

23555,Peter Panfish,2007-01-17 21:32:00,46,"Not sure what the ice is like out here on the west arm, haven't checked the measuring stick for a few days. I'll get back to everyone."
23582,Fisherman,2007-01-17 22:36:00,7201,"I'm bringing up a GMRS radio, I think the general consensus is they use Ch19 to chat on the lake."
