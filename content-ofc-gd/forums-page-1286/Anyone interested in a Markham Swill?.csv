23412,wuchikubo,2007-01-17 14:55:00,1114,"Hey Everyone,  I was wondering how many would be interested if I set up a Markham Swill most likely at the All Stars Wings place on Woodbine and 16th ave (No Frills Plaza).  www.allstarwingsandribs.com  I've never been there myself but it seems like a prime location. PM me if you have another location to consider.  I don't have a date in mind yet but would like to see how many would be interested?  The day / night would have to be a Saturday as I work M-Sat.  P.s. Yes, I just volunteered to plan this.  HearingFish"
23414,ccmtcanada,2007-01-17 14:57:00,7971,Hey there!  I'd be interested...being from just east of Toronto....I'll subscribe to this thread for updates!
23421,Beans,2007-01-17 15:15:00,3339,"Well, you're getting closer to home...only a two hour drive instead of the three  to The Firehall in Oakville..."
23426,Joey,2007-01-17 15:39:00,9122,I'd be interested.  That's just down the road a bit from me.  Joey
23450,tbayboy,2007-01-17 16:40:00,1497,"Yeah sure, love to meet some more 905ers"
23462,Kirk,2007-01-17 17:08:00,347,"Well since its a 3 minute drive I think I can swing it.  Count me in, depending on the date.  The Thai Domi Wings are a must try if they still have it without him on the roster."
23471,motv8tr,2007-01-17 17:32:00,2587,"For me to be able to make it, it would have to be this Sat or next as I'm currently on vacation, otherwise I'll have to wait for the pics  Maureen"
23605,wuchikubo,2007-01-17 23:39:00,1114,"I'm okay with trying to set it up for Jan 27th, if everyone else wants it that soon.  It would be the same day the London Swill is going on. It could be a Double Header swill night!  BTW the location for All Star Wings & Ribs is two/three lights east of Hwy 404 on 16th Ave (really easy to find). I haven't had any other suggestions for location PMed me yet so as it may go, it would be the place.  I will see if I can get a deal on the food but since it's the first time there I am not optimistic.  I'll give this post time for responses until Thurs Jan 18 5pm before I do anything else.  At last check I saw 6 other OFNCers interested, which is a small but a good start.  Stan"
