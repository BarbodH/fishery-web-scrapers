23512,Terry,2007-01-17 19:42:00,14456,it's looking pretty good   
23515,FinS,2007-01-17 19:49:00,463,do you think the entire lake will be safe by feb 15
23518,steverowbotham,2007-01-17 19:51:00,1800,"If this cold weather keeps up, then it's possible.  We need to hope for super cold nights, no snow, and no wind.  Check with local hut operators for ice thickness before you venture out.  If it's not good, then Cook's Bay and KEmpenfelt Bay should be good by then."
23519,Terry,2007-01-17 19:53:00,14456,if the weather holds..and not too much wind and not too much more snow the whole lake should be frozen by then.... but.......lots can change between no and then
23522,urbanangler1990,2007-01-17 19:58:00,933,"looking good, btw where do u get those shots from terry? is there some for island lake or the bog?"

23534,ketchenany,2007-01-17 20:55:00,3229,Her is a link for the eyes in the sky site for the great lakes.  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html
23536,urbanangler1990,2007-01-17 21:01:00,933,"hey ket , thnx for that,  but the white stuff is cloud cover right? im confused it doesnt look like ice."
23541,Clampet,2007-01-17 21:14:00,1947," Yeah, me too. By the looks of it, I would say it is open water. How can you tell what's ice or open water?"
23618,Rob,2007-01-17 23:49:00,467,"Hopefully you guys get out there real soon, I would say by next Wednesday you will be out on KB  Rob C"
23669,Carp,2007-01-18 01:47:00,1488,Just make sure of the ice thickness. Too many needless drownings last winter. I don't want to be hearing of any OFNCers going down. There's enough bad things happening. Don't become a statistic.
23674,fishindevil,2007-01-18 01:54:00,6254,"ive got my fingers crossed for you guys...  the season is not lost yet it will come dont worry,we work hard and deserve it.....i got a good feeling about it...."
