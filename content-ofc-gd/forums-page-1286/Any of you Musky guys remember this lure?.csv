I've got a lot of vivid memories of those trips, but the one thing that sticks out in my mind is the lure we used. I say ""the"" lure, 'cause my dad insisted on using only ONE lure! LOL! It was a killer though, we always caught muskies, sometimes a lot of muskies. He revered this lure, actually spoke of it in hushed tones....don't know if it was widely used or not, it likely was, but I always liked to think of it as our secret! Unfortunately his old metal tackle box with all his lures was lost during a move a few years back so they're all gone. Anyhow, I havn't seen one in years..... I was feeling nostalgic tonight and managed to unearth a pic on the net, here it is:    Good old Paul Bunyan spinner!"

23748,OhioFisherman,2007-01-18 05:56:00,6623,"Not really a Muskie guy but those are old school, haven`t seen any around in a long while."
23750,Rich,2007-01-18 06:26:00,3927,"My grandfather has one in his tackle box. It's ""brand new"" in the box. He still swears that he's going to use it one day."
23751,Woodsman,2007-01-18 08:14:00,1286,"You mean like these.  Still use them from time to time. Great for muskie, pike & large walleye. Only use them where I am confident of not getting snaged & losing them. For some reason they are hard to replace.  Best Wishes: Rick"
23778,solopaddler,2007-01-18 13:21:00,8605,"Yep, those are the ones Woodsman! The obvious difference about these bucktails and most others is the fact that they're a weight-forward spinner. They were a great lure to troll, tracked real well."
23785,lew,2007-01-18 13:47:00,12767,"Never used one myself solo, but with the single hook and forward weight, it'd be good for digging fish outta the deep weeds."
23824,mattyk,2007-01-18 16:03:00,2110,Looks like a nice lure. I cant wait for muskie season. Only a few months away.
