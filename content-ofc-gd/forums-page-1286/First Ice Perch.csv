I would assume yes but I'm not 100 percent sure.  If anybody has any thoughts or experinces they would like to share that would be great.  Thanks,  JFish"
23335,douG,2007-01-17 05:49:00,2693,I don't think that anyone has experience with a season with such late ice.  I just fish where other people are catching em.
23336,Rich,2007-01-17 06:07:00,3927,THey're just perch man.. find the school and drop a minnow down.

23622,JFish,2007-01-17 23:59:00,29,"As this is my second year out ice fishing I wasn't sure if anybody here has experienced first ice this late in the year.  Anyways, larger perch will start to move deeper during first ice for a couple reasons.  Obviously some will stay in shallow but finding the schools of larger fish is what I would assume most people are looking for.  By the sounds of it most people just go out and hope to make a hole over a school of fish or wait until they come in.  I'm just trying to figure out a bit of a pattern with them so I'm doing less hoping and more cathin', that's all.  Thanks for the replys,  JFish"
