Been really cold ever since.  On an interesting note.  All minnows used to be included in the packages offered.  Now with the ban on importing non-native minnows to Nip, some of the outfitters are charging $5.00/doz.  Which is their apparent cost.  Not that this would change any trip plans, just letting you know there may be added costs this year.  Regards"
