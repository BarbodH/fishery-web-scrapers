23594,Rob,2007-01-17 23:14:00,467,"Well I went to buy a sled and ended up with a broken leg. Out of commission for at least 12 weeks with this one. Broke both the fibula and tibia bones in my right leg. Titanium plates and screws to hold it together. I tell I have that image burned in my head of my leg being bent over the way you don't won't to see it  , extremely painfull. On 2 perks every 3 hours to kill the pain   and watching lots of movies and fishing shows.  So show me the pictures of the fish you get and make sure you guys play it say out there!!   Rob C"

23724,ch312,2007-01-18 03:51:00,1590,wow thats gotta suck...ive been lucky and ive only broken fingers before.  sounds like you slipped on the ice on the sidewalk at the place where you were gonna buy a sled. take them for as much as you can if thats the case  im sure someone can throw you on a sled and pull you out on the ice...  OR  get someone to rig up a wheelchair that goes on skis
23752,SlowPoke,2007-01-18 09:30:00,2984, That was the deposit on the sled. Those damn things cost an arm and.....
23757,pikehunter,2007-01-18 11:01:00,1659,I wish you a fast recovery so you can get back to  I don't know what will be worse? The broken leg or having to deal woth our legal system. One is probably just as painful as the other.  Good luck with both.
