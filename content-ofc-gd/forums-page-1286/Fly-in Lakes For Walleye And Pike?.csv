22794,Aaron Shirley,2007-01-15 20:39:00,655,"I know it is a little early for this question, but does anyone know of a good fly-in lake that isn't too costly in northern Ontario for walleye and pike?  Good numbers of walleye would be good.  A friend of mine asked me, but I have never done a fly-in trip in my life.  Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance,  Aaron"
22816,joonmoon,2007-01-15 21:23:00,528,"Here's where my wife and two buddies were this past July for a week. Awesome fishin, and the hospitality was second to none. http://www.esnagami.com/  Just found another one this weekend and was lookin at the web site as a possible future trip.  http://www.oldpost.com/index.php  Good luck and may all your eyes be on.   See here's some pic of the beauties from the north.          "

22829,FinS,2007-01-15 21:47:00,463,i heard of someplace up by moosonee ontario close to the james bay  but dont remember of the name
22833,Whopper,2007-01-15 22:00:00,2174,"Don't know how far your buddy wants to go, but I love this place,  great people, multiple lakes and the fishing is awesome.  http://www.armstrongoutposts.com/  Good Luck in your search!  Whopper"
22835,Garyv,2007-01-15 22:05:00,547," Your thinking of Kesagami Lake http://www.aircochrane.com/  Or the higher priced http://www.kesagami.com/  Aaron it's not to early, most of the better outfitters in these areas are fairly well booked up from year to year with American repeat business.  Just like guides down here!  Leuenbergers one of my favourites http://www.leuenberger.ca/  I've been told these guys are good http://www.twin-lakes-air.com/  and a few more http://www.midnorthflyincamps.com/  http://www.northlandoutfitters.com/  http://www.jtair.com/"

22839,Smokey,2007-01-15 22:09:00,1278,Aaron you have a pm with lots of info.  Mike
22841,silveradosheriff,2007-01-15 22:13:00,1025,"Hey Joonmoon, Esnagami looks great. Can you provide some guidance on costs as I can't seem to find that information on their website?  Thanks!"
22844,irishfield,2007-01-15 22:17:00,26272,TJ...U can take Long Point off your list. Tom is going on a well deserved fishing retirement and Troy is heading for realestate sales.  U can probably thank outragious commercial aviation insurance to some point for packing it in.....
22967,Aaron Shirley,2007-01-16 10:59:00,655,"Thanks for the great info everyone, I really appreciate it!  Good fishing!  Aaron"
22980,muskymatt,2007-01-16 12:39:00,2608,"Lakeland airways  Not as expensive as other and still really good fishing , been 2 times  Matt"
23142,joonmoon,2007-01-16 21:50:00,528,"I'm not sure what other places are like but I know Esnagami Wilderness Lodge was a perfect 10. The hospitalitity and food was second to none, the staff was awesome, and the wilderness well speaks for itself. $ for $ an awesome experience and can't wait to do it again. No regrets, can't say enuff about the place."
23207,irishfield,2007-01-17 00:08:00,26272, Which lake did Darren put you on Matt?
23480,PIKEMAN330,2007-01-17 18:05:00,10,"Aron, be aware that Esnagami Lake can be accsessed by land,much cheaper than flyin.It always bothers me to fly in to a place and then find out that there  is road access.An example a few years ago we paid $750us to fly in gouin resevoir in Quebec to meet folks that boated in.staying 300yards from us for $325."
23485,Fishandchips,2007-01-17 18:27:00,72,"Another good place iis Timberwolf Lodge ,its on Nagagami Lake near Hornepayne,went there on our honeymoon,great food,fishing and accommadations and the price was around 1400.00 for 7 days including flight per person,hope this helps Brian"
23498,discophish,2007-01-17 19:09:00,392,"I will also add that Esnagami Lodge was an awesome trip experience.  The owners, Sue and Eric, are terrific people.  They will ensure that your time spent fishing and at the lodge are memorable ones.  Gigantic pike are found in those waters, so large and aggressive that the fact of catching pickerel every cast has their guides bored.  Our guide explained to us that they don't even fish for pickerel, which was hard to hear since the majority of my time is angling for pickerel.  The only suggestion I can think of to make that trip better would be for them to add more horses behind their boats, but I realize the cost will be heavily weighted for them to do so, insur. etc.  The big and heavy (yet perfect) wooden boats were underpowered for such a huge lake.  It took a while to get from spot to the next, let alone shore lunch locations.  Good Luck!  Disco Phish"
