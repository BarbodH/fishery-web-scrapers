23533,aplumma,2007-01-17 20:55:00,6896,Sharks are just part of swimming at the beach. The scary animals are the skates and rays that are buried just below the sand and when you step on them they get you with the tail barb. Between the surgery and the infections you can get into alot of pain/complications quickly.  Art
23592,GbayGiant,2007-01-17 23:12:00,1780,You shark fisherman have some big kahoonas.
23647,mepps,2007-01-18 01:20:00,1301,"wow, very nice!"
23712,Rizzo,2007-01-18 03:07:00,4754,"awesome stuff.  I hear there are a lot of hammerheads in the Singer Island area, go get a big one!"
23722,Carp,2007-01-18 03:33:00,1488,Awesome !!!  That's why I prefer the pool at the local community center. Never know when one of those with teeth and an appetite may want to nip you for a taste.  Watch Jaws right before going on a beach vacation. That will keep you in the resort pool for sure.  Nurse and Whale Sharks are pretty timid. Don't think they have teeth either.
23260,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 02:28:00,1154,"Can't wait to head down, the toothy ones are cruising off the beaches feeding on pale Canadians! JK  The Spinners have started to move and there have been many reports of loads of Bull sharks and some nice sized hammerheads...  Give me my rod!!!  here are some pics from this week, nice T head from the beach ( buddy sent me a report)     7 feet.. ( toes are a bit close to the mouth for my liking!)  Now I believe in catch and release but if its going to get you bite...  "
23264,Smokey,2007-01-17 02:50:00,1278,"Great pictures, looks like a beauty beach to hang out on. I might not go swimming there though. Thanks for the pics and good luck when you get down there Jamie.  Mike"
23276,snag,2007-01-17 03:25:00,1932,"Crazy,  That was awesome!  Almost doesn't seem real.  Thanks!"
23297,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 03:55:00,1154,"the second pic is my favorite, it took an hour and a half to land the fish..."
23298,nautifish,2007-01-17 03:58:00,1416,I thought Hammerheads were more THE PLACID type of the sharks?
23299,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 03:59:00,1154,nope they will mess you up!
23300,nautifish,2007-01-17 03:59:00,1416,So your saying they are agressive?
23303,Joey,2007-01-17 04:06:00,9122,"Cool pictures.  I'd hate to get pulled in with a shark attached to my line while I'm strapped to the rod like that guy is tho     Note the people running down the beach to check it out.  And Nauti, I'd say any fish or shark would be aggresive if it had a hook stuck in its mouth and was being yanked into shore     Just its survival instinct I'll bet.  Joey"
23304,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 04:07:00,1154,have you ever seen one chase a tarpon?
23310,Pigeontroller,2007-01-17 04:11:00,2793,"Cool pics, good to see it being released! Too many Sharks are caught and killed!"
23313,Joey,2007-01-17 04:12:00,9122, I think there have been a couple of those video's floating around here on OFC lately hasn't there Jamie?  They are very aggressive in those for sure.  Joey
23314,nautifish,2007-01-17 04:12:00,1416,  LOL Joey...Well i would think any fish or mammal that was yanked arounf with a hook by its mouth would be pretty pished off to say the least.....lol  But i was under the impression the hammerheads were more the placid ones of most of the sharks...Ahh hell what do i know i watch to much bloody discovery planet i do.....lol
23316,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 04:15:00,1154,here is one if you have not seen one  
23317,nautifish,2007-01-17 04:21:00,1416,That was pretty kool but that guy has got to be bonkers sat on that bench seat like that with no harness. Lucky he never went for a swim with the shark.....lol
23321,steverowbotham,2007-01-17 04:29:00,1800,"CRAZY! I've only fished in the ocean one time and that was in Cozumel, Mexico.  We went deep sea fishing for dolphin. it was a blast!"
23338,jediangler,2007-01-17 06:16:00,1923,"That was a supercool video man, thanks. Can you imagine how extreme it would be to fish for them from a sit-on-top kayak?  This was a black tip shark between 5-6ft long. It was released by the fisherman by cutting the flouro leader at boatside."
23351,Big Cliff,2007-01-17 11:02:00,6899,"Nice fish!  You are not allowed to fish for sharks within 1/2 mile of shore in Myrtle Beach because they don't want to the tourists to know they are around. If you do catch one accedently while fishing for other species, you are not allowed to use a net or gaff to help you land it, mind you the ones we are catching here are considered big at 10 lbs."
23387,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-17 13:25:00,0,Very cool pics Jamie.  Did you catch that Discovery Channel special on the weekend on the 10 deadliest predator sharks ?  When I started watching I thought for sure Great White's would be number 1....they were actually number 2......Bull Sharks were #1.  White tips I think were number 3 and Mako's were number 4.  Great show !!
23390,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 13:46:00,1154, Sharks are bad for beach tourism. Some county's in Florida have the same rules and you can get a big fine for fishing for and bringing a shark to the beach ( fine is something bad like endangering the well being of others).We usually drive up the coast about an hour to where you can do it. Alot of people fish for them off the piers. I did it last time and got many looks from some of the tourists and pier rats. Sharks are great fun and put up a great fight.Had a black Tip take 700 yards of line on the first run  As for the top 10 show. I saw that one it was awesome!!! Bull Sharks are crazy!!! on top of my to catch list as well!
23407,Uncle Buck,2007-01-17 14:39:00,1000,"Sure puts my little Grunt to Shame...  caught this little guy Drift fishing off the coast in Ft. Lauderdale  not the rod, kind of like perch fishing with a musky rod  "
23448,blaque,2007-01-17 16:29:00,2419,Saw the discovery special as well......pretty sure teh hammerhead was up there as far as aggressors. I know the whale shark is the most timid of  the sharks.
23460,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 17:02:00,1154,Nurse Sharks are like a big catfish
23467,fishindevil,2007-01-17 17:22:00,6254,"WOW...thats pretty amazing   and that guy is awful brave or really stupid,to habdle that shark like that...i hear they cruise just 20-100ft from shore i sure wouldnt want to be swimming there....but man it sure would be a blast to catch one of those big boys for sure..."
23470,Mike Pike,2007-01-17 17:32:00,1332,Guessing you don't lip them.
23476,mattyk,2007-01-17 17:49:00,2110,Thats crazy! Thanks for sharing the pics.
