What an afternoon we had yesterday.    or if this works....  <object width=""425"" height=""350""> <param name=""movie"" value=""  Father and daughter each on their own sled. Better watch your trolling baits come spring time boys and girls. Four fire trucks, search and rescue,  an ambulance, cop cars - geez what the neighbours must have been thinking was going on at our place. I shot the video from my bedroom window. My wife called 911. Buddy was standing on his sled to get as high out of the water as he could. How pissed do you figure his wife is ... taking his daughter on the ice already?  I guess the salvage operators will be parked in my driveway this morning.  The ice isn't as safe as you might think folks - please be careful."
23793,Sandbag,2007-01-18 14:02:00,533,Geez.....Thank goodness that they are both OK....I can tell you right now what my wife would do.  Not too pleasant.  Play safe

23808,Jer,2007-01-18 14:46:00,1426,"I'm expecting to see the same on Chemong this weekend. Most of the lake has only been frozen over for a few days...but already there was some skidoo tracks on there yesterday afternoon. I can just see all the city folks up for the weekend saying ""lookit all that snow""...not realizing there might be less than 2"" of ice under there."

24037,fishindevil,2007-01-19 02:01:00,6254,"yes and i think we will be hearing more of that this weekend or next,everybody is in such a rush to get on their snowmachines to get right out there and giver...well get ready here comes the weekend...."
24047,Carp,2007-01-19 02:21:00,1488,"  Expensive mistake. Hope the pilot and any passengers got out O.K.  Please don't be in the news for the wrong reasons. Even ponds have only a few inches of ice, if any at all. I passed by about a dozen ponds today. I don't think even one had been completely frozen over, or if it was, didn't stay that way for long. Always an open spot somewhere. It's just too warm during the day. Runoff erodes the edges quickly."
