23126,douG,2007-01-16 21:17:00,2693,"I finally got the team on the same page, and I'm confirmed for Booi's Lodge on Trout Lake near Red Lake Ontario for next July. Looks like this will come together, finally.  We'll be trying the full Am plan this trip, enjoying Jim and Tracy's hospitality and fine cooking when we are not hunting the lakers and walleye.   Good thing I'm not excited yet.  "
23128,pigeonfisher,2007-01-16 21:19:00,696,you certainly deserve a nice break like that!
23129,solopaddler,2007-01-16 21:24:00,8605,"Nice choice, I've only ever heard good things about Booi's."
23151,TennesseeGuy,2007-01-16 22:22:00,957,"I've run out of things to say, but good luck and enjoy your trip."
23152,Clampet,2007-01-16 22:24:00,1947,"Ohhh, that looks niiiiice!"
23153,Smokey,2007-01-16 22:26:00,1278,"Your going to have a blast Doug. I'll be watching for the report and all the pics. If you need any info on Red Lake for travel or accomodations along the way, I have a few friends from up that way that I can ask. Just let me know.  Mike"
23155,Terry,2007-01-16 22:31:00,14456,the second day of winter weather and you have to show me that...yeah  looks like a great place
23156,irishfield,2007-01-16 22:33:00,26272,Come on Doug....hurry up....get packin that bug gear..LOL  Memories Doug...Memories in the making....
23294,danc,2007-01-17 03:53:00,4677,Looks like a very nice place Doug. I can't blame you for being excited. I'm sure you'll have a ball.
23305,brickNblock,2007-01-17 04:08:00,598,WoW Dougie........... WTG!!!!!!!!!! Yessireee..that indeed is a outing of a lifetime. I'm finding myself drooling over this one for sure. Please send us plenty of pics and a great story of your adventure. Thats what I call a vacation...........cool Bud!
23307,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 04:10:00,1154,that looks awesome! can't wait to see a report
23312,snag,2007-01-17 04:11:00,1932,Congrats Doug!  Can't wait for the reports.  Kinda suprised you didn't fly by rocket though?? 
23322,Hooked,2007-01-17 04:31:00,891,That took a few minutes before could I let that picture disappear to the top of my browser window.  That place looks amazing.  How long you gonna be up there for?
23331,douG,2007-01-17 05:07:00,2693,"It'll be a full day to get there, flying Toronto to Winnipeg, then a short 5 hour drive back east almost to Dryden and north to Red Lake.  We will take motel rooms and dinner in Red Lake, and then a 25 minute flight by float plane to the lodge the next morning after breakfast.  We'll spend Sunday night in Red lake, then four nights in, leaving for Toronto on Friday.  We could fly from Winnipeg to Red Lake, but Bearskin AL wants more than WestJet does for the TO/Peg leg.  We'll save more than three large by doing the driving.  The crew is my Dad and 2 of his cronies from our Algonquin Park crew, and possibly my brother.  Dad is the youngest of his group at a spry 74, while Marc,  the eldest statesman is almost 80.  As for my brother,  nobody likes him, so it doesn't matter really one way or the other.  I'm getting used to him tho.          Tennessee Guy knows the area well, and has been giving me lots of great info.  Thanks very much,  Connie.  If you are in the area while we are there, make sure you stop in for a smart beverage.  Peg Leg.  I SAID, oh never mind."
23363,Whopper,2007-01-17 12:06:00,2174,Looks like an excellent choice DouG.  Happy Trails  Whopper
23365,camillj,2007-01-17 12:12:00,1988,Sure looks like purdie country douG !  Jeeze ... I was just getting in the mood for some hardwater activities and now ya got me thinkin about the spring opener at the ZEC ... make sure you take two cameras and lotsa batteries
23383,bigbuck,2007-01-17 13:11:00,2449,I'm green with envy. It doesn't look like we'll be making the annual pilgrammage to LOTW this summer. I've got too much on the go at work and a 20+hour drive with 2 rug rats would be a bit much.
23389,John,2007-01-17 13:36:00,2956,"Dang douG, got room in the suitcase! Glad you are going for the ""Full Monty"". American Plan is the only way to go, that way you can spend more time on the water and less time in the kitchen.  Sounds like an amazing trip.  J..."
