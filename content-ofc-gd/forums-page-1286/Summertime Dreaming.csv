23405,lew,2007-01-17 14:29:00,12767,"Nippissing, thanks for those pictures, it looks like you really do have a little slice of Heaven up there.  I especially like your 1st picture, there's not a better way to start the day than sipping a coffee while watching the sun come up across the lake  There's also not a better way to end the day either, than sitting around the fire with family."
23415,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-17 14:59:00,0,Nice pictures for sure.  Thanks for posting.
23458,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-17 17:01:00,2585,awesome!  I spent alot of time fishing in the south bay in summer 2006!  Lots of islands to fish and great scenery shots!  You are one lucky fellow having a place up there!  Cheers!

23468,lew,2007-01-17 17:29:00,12767," Hey Nip, I go by your place a couple times a year, and I'm ALWAYS early, so don't be too surprised if you hear me banging on your door about 3:00 AM some day lookin for that coffee  And donuts too, I like donuts with my coffee"

23973,setomonkey,2007-01-18 23:46:00,872,Looks like a piece of paradise... Just five more months until my fishing trip in June... sigh...  Mike
23978,Bernie,2007-01-18 23:55:00,3190,I count my blessings that I had a Grandfather that had foresight way back in the 1920's. It was like I won a lottery when I inherited it. I have a great family.
