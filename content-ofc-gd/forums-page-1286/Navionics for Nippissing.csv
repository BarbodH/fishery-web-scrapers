It'll be available in about 2 weeks for about $200 cdn  The salesman was alone and very busy and didn't have time to do much checking, and he didn't know what other lakes  would be covered along with Nippissing, but he didn't think it would include anything in Southern Ontario.  That's all the info he could give me."
23141,Roy,2007-01-16 21:49:00,13728,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS   best news I've had today!!! Thank you Lew!
23144,blaque,2007-01-16 21:55:00,2419,"let us know what regional description that is. I have the north east chip (code# 901G) and was looking for nippissing the other day on it as Im planning a possible trip there this May. The region was ""squared in"" but when zooming in, No Nippissing. Oh well......ill be darned if Im gonna pay 200 bucks just for a once a year trip  to Nippissing LOL!!! (Im 6 hours south)"
23146,Raf,2007-01-16 21:57:00,3495,"I hope this is finally true but I'll believe it when it's on the store shelves.  It was ""next month"" 2 years ago."
23148,NJ Gimo,2007-01-16 22:11:00,7,"That's interesting because I read a while back that only Garmin had the ""rights"" to use Canadian Hydrographic Service maps in creating their software. Just curious what map sources they are using."
23149,woodro,2007-01-16 22:14:00,168,isnt all that information that navinocs use available through the ministry of natural resources?
23191,Blake,2007-01-16 23:45:00,418,There wwas some sort of legal battle going on for rights to the maps but I think Navionics won the ruling as their new chips are great for detail.
23195,danc,2007-01-16 23:48:00,4677, Just think Roy. Now you can actually leave the dock.
23201,muskymatt,2007-01-16 23:55:00,2608,That's awesome ...  bout time!!
23245,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-17 01:36:00,0, Well crap Matt next time we won't have an excuse for not catching fish.
23246,bigfish1965,2007-01-17 01:38:00,3382,The list of covered lakes is on the navionics website.
