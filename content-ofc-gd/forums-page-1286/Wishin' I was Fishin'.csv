While I wait and pray for colder weather, I thought I'd share some of my favourite fishing pictures from 2006.   this bag of largemouth helped my team advance to New York this July.   biggest salmon I've ever caught, got him on a 4 egg roe bag at the Clay Banks in Bowmanville Creek.   A small club tournament that I won in September.   8th Place at the Orillia Fall Challenge   First salmon of 06.   Nice dropshot fish on Rice Lake.   17th Place on Six Mile (Bassmania Western). Not a day for big fish, but we caught over 70!   My girlfriends monster smallie from camping this summer.   My girlfriend is learning the art of bass fishing, and I love it!   Club pike tournament I won with my dad, who lives in Saskatchewan but flew in.   Monster Smallie   Big topwater smallie!   my girlfriend with a nice pike from Couchiching.   first ling, about 1:30am   lots of fish, twelve teenagers = full stomachs.  Thanks for reading and browsing.  Steve"
