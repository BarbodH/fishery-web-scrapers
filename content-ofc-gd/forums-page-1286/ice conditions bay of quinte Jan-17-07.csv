The one thing I should mention is that we still have a lot of water coming down all of the major rivers that drain into the bay as a result of the rains we have had, so this will create a lot of unsafe ice in a lot of areas until we are froze up solid. With the ice that we do have the bay should be making ice everyday now especially at night. I still think that it is very unsafe to venture out at this time. We still have open water in a lot of places. It is getting better so hang in there and we will all be fishing before you know it. Ron"
