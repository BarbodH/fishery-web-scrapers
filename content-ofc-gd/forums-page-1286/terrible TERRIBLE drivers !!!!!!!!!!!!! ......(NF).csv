23165,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-16 22:53:00,0, But I can drive. There never was any need to hold onto the door.
23171,Crazyhook,2007-01-16 23:12:00,1154,"too much Nascar IMO! yes you cna drive...  fast but you cna drive... thats better then the idiots who are afraid, they cause the accidents"
23179,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-16 23:25:00,0," Responsible Nascar  LOL I have cruse control for a reason, lock her at 15 Over. It saves me some $$ and points.  BTW you never saw Nascar as I drive conservativly with others in my vehicule."
23183,Crazyhook,2007-01-16 23:30:00,1154,I have seen Nascar! Actually the first ever race I saw was with you in the prior  What did you get me in Chicago? some new dawgs??
23197,irishfield,2007-01-16 23:48:00,26272,Cruise control and freezing rain....that'll come back to bite you one of these days....LOL
23238,Fisherman,2007-01-17 01:13:00,7201,"Along with a couple of the statements I read above, the first thing they usually say after they end up in the ruhbarb is....""I didn't think that""...ya.   You can't fault road conditions, only drivers that are unwilling or too stubborn to conform to weather conditions because they think they are gods gift to a steering wheel.  Drive like a Villeneuve and sooner or later you'll end up like one, either in a crash or dead."
23249,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-17 01:45:00,0," That's part of knowing how to drive, even with slush cruise control is not recommended even with traction control. With a day like yesterday there was no worries about speeding, well not always I did pass a few cops.  Another rule of winter is to lay off the brakes, even if you're sideways you can recover by steering in the right direction and let the vehicle do the work. Been there done that.  Brakes will only make you lose control."
23254,Bernie,2007-01-17 02:10:00,3190,"Drove tractor trailer for 10 years, and another 10 part time...Lots of stories about the crazies..... No more road rage for me.... Live in a small community a block from my shop and 12 miles from my summer place.. Its heaven"
23267,DebS,2007-01-17 03:10:00,56,"You're absolutely right, Lew! We have to share the roads with a lot of idiots! And people wonder why our insurance rates are high! Deb"
23273,pigeonfisher,2007-01-17 03:22:00,696,Good move...thanks for removing that one post. (and mine too I guess)
23275,jjcanoe,2007-01-17 03:24:00,744,"Hey all just be glad that you're not me.  I do 2 round trips from London to Vaughan Monday to Friday.  Just cause I have 18 wheels doesn't mean I have 18 brakes!  Here's my theory... The more bad winter driving days we get, the fewer bad winter drivers we'll have next time around. (thin their numbers!) Please don't cut in front of Big trucks and slam on the brakes. I think it was the CAA that did a poll last year about car drivers driving around trucks and the results stated that car drivers #1 concern was being rear ended by a truck on the highway.  Well duh, don't cut in front of us.  The safest place is behind us because it takes us a lot longer to stop than cars and if you were back there you'd be stopped long before us.  Yes there are some bad truck drivers out there but they are the minority.  No we're not all on speed etc. we're one of the few professions in Canada that is subject to drug testing, and we are the most regulated industry on the continent.  My rant for the week  jjcanoe"
23347,OhioFisherman,2007-01-17 09:47:00,6623,"It`s hard for most people to use their driving skills when they are talking on a cell phone, eating breakfast on the way to work, putting on makeup in the car, reading the newspaper. Just heavy rain here Monday and accidents all over, closer you get to the city the worse it gets.  Even though I am sick if the weathers bad I drive, with the dear wife behind the wheel I would have to be crazy."
23367,Chris,2007-01-17 12:31:00,405,"I get a kick of idiot drivers that think they're getting somewhere fast. I used to have this moron go flying past me every single morning on my 1 hour commute. Passing on double lines, approaching hills, even with oncoming traffic, etc. By the time I'd get to the city, there he would be, about 6 cars ahead of me at the traffic lights. One icy morning, as usual he passed me as if I was standing still. A few kilometers up the road, there he was, planted way down in the bottom of the ditch. We pulled over, and he yelled up from the ditch, ""can you guys call for assistance"". The guy I was with says, ""No, you're right where you belong, people are a little bit safer"". We jumped back in the car and took off, leaving him there. The kicker is....even after this incident, I would still see him every single morning, still flying down the road at breakneck speed.....all so he could get to the city 2 minutes faster. Some idiots just don't ever learn."
23371,lew,2007-01-17 12:44:00,12767, I luv it Chris !!!!
23451,Bitsmith2k,2007-01-17 16:42:00,396,lew.. maybe you can do a future rant about merging onto the highway.. if you want an example just get on the westbound gardiner at the start (lakeshore and carlaw) at around 5pm.. watch how many douches ride out that right lane until the last possible second and then get all pissy when you dont slam the brakes to let them in..
23537,kemper,2007-01-17 21:02:00,2232,"Your not kidding Lew!  As a brand new driver (were talking having the G2 for 2 weeks here) I was out in the snow and crap the other day and would like to say that 99 percent of the drivers on the road right now need to go straight back to driving school and do the 35 hours that I just did. Ubelievable some of the things that I never noticed untill I did the driving school, and how they can be really dangerous.  Seems strange to me that a 17 year old kid can keep a car on the road when these so called ""experianced"" drivers are in the ditch."
23670,Nanook,2007-01-18 01:48:00,565,"You make a good point Kemper,but dont get over confident. Good for you, to take the 'course,but that only makes you aware of situations.Each journey out should be a learning experience,and,you should be learning for a long time."
23675,Peter Panfish,2007-01-18 01:55:00,46,"This should show up on the Rick Mercer Report lol he could use some phrase like  ""Snow In Canada. EVERYBODY PANIC"""
23020,pigeonfisher,2007-01-16 15:14:00,696,"don't forget how many drivers we have in the GTA that have never driven in snow before, some have never seen snow.  This could be/is a MAJOR cause for all of these accidents.  Being a proffessional driver (80,000 kms a year) I have seen it all.  I have found that the combination of people driving in the wrong lane and being ""over cautious"" in changing situations causes more accidents than the few people going to fast.  Someone going 40 on a two lane highway because they are unsure of the road conditions is not safe, it forces people to make an aggressive move to get around them.  While being passed the unsafe driver becomes nervous and often jams on the brakes.  This causes the drivers beside and behind the unsafe driver to react to the situation.  Often times it is not an action that causes accidents but the reaction of the other drivers around the person.  Be careful, drive according to road conditions.  If you have to drive at %50 of the posted limit then either the roads aren't safe or you are not confident enough in your driving to be on them.  In either case, GET OFF THE ROAD."
23022,davew3,2007-01-16 15:16:00,430,"I know what you mean Lew. Saturday out shopping a little snow and slush, I am at a yeild waiting for traffic, just let off the brakes, touch the gas and BUMP. Look in my mirror at a big white van. I get out, he gets out and says "" I couldn't stop, I had my brakes locked"" and I said to him IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR!!! SLOW DOWN !!!   Come on people  pay attention, it can save your life."

23036,ecmilley,2007-01-16 16:17:00,2163,"took me 3 hours to get to work monday, no probs doing 80-90k down the 115 but iguess all the drivers in oshawa, whitby ajax can only muster about 20 km/h. this is Canada buy some darn snow tires and if you don't want them buy a go pass"
23056,Fisherman,2007-01-16 17:18:00,7201,"Ya, those are the days that if you don't need to be on the road, stay home.  No you don't need to go to Timmies for a coffee, or need to go fishing, better to stay home on a bad day and have another day later to enjoy."
23101,Nanook,2007-01-16 19:49:00,565,"My car has anti-lock brakes, superduperxx tires,auto allwheel drive,all the latest gizmos. does that mean I have to know how to drive as well?  I put the blame on stupid advertising................some people believe all the  see. Good post Lew!"
23107,Eddyk,2007-01-16 20:11:00,195,Lew. I havent seen you this upset since that old lady in the canoe cut you off when you were casting.
23154,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-16 22:31:00,4399,"It`s a fact that once you get south of the mullet line(Hwy.9) driving when you even the slightest bit of snow on the ground is a risky proposition too many people who don`t have a clue how to handle a car when conditions are less than ideal and thats not even mentioning the cheap bald summer tires they have on their cars and forget the so called all season tire they are next to useless in a Canadian winter,snow tires should be mandatory."
23158,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-16 22:37:00,0,"OMG Lew you hit a nerve. I was unfortunate enough to have to drive about through Ontario or 1000 Kms in this filtered try again please yesterday. I left Flint Michigan at 6:30 AM and got home at 4:30 PM some 2 plus hours later then I should.  Wow I guess it ain't that bad 8 hours instead of 6 but my god I witnessed 2 live spins within 100 yards in front of me and many others just seconds prior. I counted 3 tractor traillers in the ditch as well as a couple dozen cars. All were single car crash and spin.  What gets me here, I was doing 100-120 whenever I wasn't stuck in traffic. And not once did I ever slip one bit. This tells me that the roads weren't all that bad. I know I have superior driving skills and that I installed new tires ( not winters but an agressive tread and they are 17 x 60 ) on my Avalanche the day before I left for the Chicago Muskie Show.  I also hate the guys going way to slow in the middle or left lane as well as the ***holes that refuse to move over. They pass a truck but stay in the left lane because they will be passing another some 300 yrds later. I guess they are to darn lazy to move their stiring wheel a couple of inches with their finger sticker out to hit the signal. That really burns me as much as those idiots to cut in front of you making you hit your brakes, you should never have to hit your brakes but once you are on the off ramp. Those guys should pay a brake tax as they are wasting others pads.  Glad I got that one off my chest, Hey if you see a red Avalanche with BIGMUSKY plates get out of the way."
23164,Crazyhook,2007-01-16 22:51:00,1154,Richard I have seen you drive!  I held onto the door the whole time!
