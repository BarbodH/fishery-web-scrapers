23433,Beans,2007-01-17 15:53:00,3339,"Any ice on the local ponds ???  Was scanning the Weather Network this A.M. and noticed your temps were down around the freezing mark 0*C (32*F)...I got a manual auger (8"") you are welcome to...  Cliff...I hope you packed your long-johns...+4*C (39*F) don't sound like shorts wearing temps to me..."
23437,Greencoachdog,2007-01-17 16:01:00,8163,"'Tis a bit nippy here this morn, but the only thing I can think of I would need that auger for would be to dig post holes for the fence I'm goin' to put up... or maybe I could use it for a boat anchor?  Have a good one Beans, and try to stay warm up there while trudging thru the tundra!  Glen  BTW... We'll be sure to pay you back for this cold Canadian air mass you've so thoughtfully sent, this summer with some nice stifiling heat and humidity!!!"
23438,Whopper,2007-01-17 16:05:00,2174,Real funny Beans  Told Lew this morning that winter has finally arrived After four days of rain and temps in the 50's we have had back to back days in the 20's now. Had a heck of a time getting in the truck this am because it was frozen shut. Going to hold you responsible now  Go ahead and send the auger but can't guarantee I'll use it  Whopper
23440,Greencoachdog,2007-01-17 16:13:00,8163,I'm quite miffed at them too Phil!... had to put on a dang shirt this mornin'!!!
23479,Whopper,2007-01-17 18:00:00,2174, Well dawg I guess if there is a bright spot to this cold weather you being fully dressed is a good thing
23483,motv8tr,2007-01-17 18:16:00,2587,Ya well according to the news up here all this cold weather is thanks to a front that came up from the US so don't be blaming us Dawg...  Maureen
23497,Entropy,2007-01-17 19:09:00,747,"""I got a manual auger (8"") you are welcome to""  That would be great... the club sure could use it's own.  You are on the other forum too, right?  Entropy  http://forums.fishontario.com/thread.jspa?...5&tstart=30"
23521,Daplumma,2007-01-17 19:57:00,1961,Had to plug in the tank heater for the goat water yesterday and run the lights on all night for the chickens.No real ice yet on the water. Joe
23538,aplumma,2007-01-17 21:03:00,6896,I checked the ponds this morning and just a sparkle of ice but it was gone as soon as the sun hit it. Dont let Glen use the ice auger it will only make him dizzy from running around it in circles. Besides he would make himself crazy trying to turn it backwards to refill the hole . .......A Sunkissed Alabama Redneck with an Ice auger......... man thats nothin but pure entertainment!!!!  Art
23549,pigeonfisher,2007-01-17 21:27:00,696, that just sounds funny.
23584,crappiesteve,2007-01-17 22:41:00,220,"...hey Joe,why don,t you ask Art if he wants to babysit,your chickens.So they  are not lonely.   Steve"
23586,aplumma,2007-01-17 22:49:00,6896,"I dont mind babysittin them little fellows but getting all of them in their little PJ,s is tuff. Besides I felt hen pecked for a week afterwards.  Art"
23588,Daplumma,2007-01-17 22:51:00,1961,"Not a chance Steve,the last time he watched the chickens he taught them how to smoke cigars and play poker.Now my dogs have no lunch money cause the chickens took it all! Joe"
23589,crappiesteve,2007-01-17 22:58:00,220,"...Yeah.it would be risky for him to watch them again.  But does he play poker with them ,or the chickens already beat him HeHe.   Steve"
23665,Beans,2007-01-18 01:44:00,3339,"Hey Phil...If it makes you feel any better, I too could not get the driver's side door open on our station wagon yesterday...Fortunately the passenger side opened but after two hours of wrestling with my heavy old snowblower on Monday I wasn't in much shape for climbing over the hump and the gear shift lever in the center...(getting too old )  By the time I got to town and parked in the sun while I picked up some groceries the lock had thawed out enough that I got the door open with a pry bar..."
23678,Whopper,2007-01-18 02:07:00,2174,Well Beans I had to get over the hump so I could go to work after all it is Wednesday  Art LOL at the new avatar!
23717,Carp,2007-01-18 03:14:00,1488," AMEN !!!  A shot of GDC's shirtless, frozen nipples ? Don't know if I can handle all that exitement ?   That's a hillarious avatar Art. Can't be real. I've never seen Roy with a tan."
23773,Big Cliff,2007-01-18 12:50:00,6899,"Well, it is 36 F here right now with light rain but is going up to 50 and the forcast for the next 5 days puts it in the mid 50 range. Guess everyone North of here and inland is having a rough time. He have to head for home around the end of next week so I have been looking for a weather window but it looks like it's going to be a slow trip. Sounds like a perfect day to go over to BPS and drool.....Tomorrow it's going up to 58 and sunny, sounds like another good day for pier fishing."
