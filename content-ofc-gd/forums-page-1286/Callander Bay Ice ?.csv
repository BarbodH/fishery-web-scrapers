23604,mason05,2007-01-17 23:34:00,258,I'm heading to the Bay early February with Sherriff and some other hooligans. I was wondering if anyone up that way could let me know how the thickness/depth is coming along. We're going to Hyatt's so if anyone knows if he's got huts out now...... Thanks  Corn Nug
