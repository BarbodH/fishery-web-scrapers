133240,Headhunter,2007-11-13 20:49:00,5703,"There are places you can fish where you can generally get out of the bad stuff... that being said, better to be safe, then sorry. Bring extra gloves, hats, socks... what ever you need to keep warm. Also, at the end of the day, don't forget to turn your float suite inside out and allow it to dry over night or you'll be getting into a cold damp suit the next morning! Also remove the liners from your boats and allow them to dry out over night. HH"
133241,Terry,2007-11-13 20:50:00,14456,"wel,l we know weather men can't tell what it's going to do in 3 hours, so long range means nothing..see you on the water"

133610,ccmtcanada,2007-11-14 17:19:00,7971,"Thanks HH....just rechecked sailflow.com and they are now saying 10 knot winds on Saturday and Sunday(down from 15) and the same for Windguru.  They both say Saturday night winds going up to 16 knots, then die off to 10 by morning again.  Environment Canada's website and The Weathernetwork do not show any snow/ice in their forecasts though....  The weather will be what it will be....watch...it'll be calm winds, 20C....LOL."
