133213,Headhunter,2007-11-13 19:21:00,5703,Putting cream in your coffee before you pour will net you a better tasting coffee. HH
133214,ccmtcanada,2007-11-13 19:23:00,7971, Really?  Wow...I put the cream in first cause I'm too lazy to stir it with a spoon....LOL
133223,crappieperchhunter,2007-11-13 20:13:00,2582,"Jeez Meely.  Next time I'm at the ""Manor"" I'll have a coffee rather then a bottle of water. Sounds like I've been missing out."
133230,Dabluz,2007-11-13 20:30:00,701,"For me, the best coffee that I make is by grinding Arabica beans, that I buy by the kilo at the grocery store, just before making the coffee.  Ideally, the grinder must not heat the beans during the grinding but that would take a very expensive grinder to do that.  I then place the very very fine ground coffee in a filter then pour just enough hot water over the coffee to fill a cup.  The nice part of this technique is that it's easy to do when camping or fishing.  I bring along water, coffee, filters and a tiny naphtha stove for brewing coffee in the boat when fishing.  I only add a bit of sugar to the coffee.  When I buy coffee in town, it's usually at Tim Horton's.  However, across the street from my house, there is a tiny breakfast place that has the best coffee that I have ever bought.  The owner buys her coffee beans then grinds it herself with an expensive grinder that does not heat up the coffee beans during the grinding proc√®ss.  The water we get at our house is great.  A big bottling company wants to buy the rights to this water but the municipality turned them down.  I'm sure that the quality of the water has a lot to do with the taste of coffee."
133278,Meely,2007-11-13 22:21:00,282,"douG,  I would recommend an Indonesian coffee.  Indonesians compliment cheeses VERY well. Try pairing one up with Brie cheese. Very rich.....almost buttery.  Secondly, when brewing at home .....if possible try to use cold filtered water. This will always yield the best flavour. Lastly,  in order to yield the best tasting coffee, boiling water  should never be used. Boiling water will ruin the extraction process and make horrible coffee.  The best tasting coffee is produced using water at 88 - 93 degrees celsius.  Meely"

133446,snag,2007-11-14 03:28:00,1932,I have to say that I am impressed.  I have been neglectfully ignorant of my coffee consumption.  Such a daily beverage deserves some forethought.  Quite an education here.  Now if only I knew how to bookmark..................

133458,douG,2007-11-14 03:55:00,2693," That's Italian ham and stinky cheese on a  Calabrese bun. If you're not down with Calabrese, call it an 'Italian country style' bun.   A sangweech.  Thanks, Meely, for the advice and correspondence.   Since that icefish trip with  Ron, Rattletrap and you 4 years ago, I never go fishing without a bag full of gweeches.  Especially since I don't have a boat.  Best to the gweechmaster."

133194,Meely,2007-11-13 18:31:00,282,"Just like wine, coffee has many different characteristics. The characteristics are determined by a number of things. Type of bean ( Arabica are the premium bean VS. Robusta a lower grade coffee bean), the country of origin, the growing region in that country, and also how the coffee was processed greatly influences a coffee's characteristics.  The main growing regions in the world are ( I know....there are more) : Latin America, Africa, and Indonesia. Each region produces coffee that is greatly different.  Latin america: usually nutty in aroma with a high acidity and mild in body Africa: usually floral in aroma, medium acidity, and have a very ""citrusy"" flavour Indonesia: usually very ""earthy"" in flavour, low acidity and are usually Bold or full bodied  Most ""commercial"" coffee is comprised of the lower grade Robusta beans ""topped/mixed"" in with some Arabica beans. Arabica beans are like the Ferrari's of beans. Very few coffees are 100% Arabica as they are more expensive.  Most of the world's coffee is grown between the two tropics where the climate is pretty consistent. A coffee tree will usually yieald about a pound of roasted coffee per year and will usually only produce for 10 years.  Just like wine, coffee ""pairs"" very well with certain foods as opposed to others. IE: A lemon pie will pair very well with an African Coffee.  Brewing methods are also very important when considering how you like your coffee. My house has always seen freshly ground espresso beans used on a stove top brewer.  Just my ""2 Beans"" worth.......  Meely"
