133440,camillj,2007-11-14 03:24:00,1988,"  Looks like he's our treasure now Art, but dont worry something tells me he's being well taken care of"
133179,Bly,2007-11-13 18:13:00,1556,Just spoke with Glen as he was passing through....  Said it has been brutal being in his truck for 2 days but all is well and he should be at Merland's soon   Might be making at stop at Carra Outdoors on his way
133182,Roy,2007-11-13 18:16:00,13728,Thanks Carole. He left yesterday morning so I thought he might be getting to Quinte this morning. He said he'd be stopping at Sam's if the timing was right. Nice of you to update.
133184,irishfield,2007-11-13 18:18:00,26272,Whopper tried to get him to stay overnight at his house...but he treked on instead....
133185,Whopper,2007-11-13 18:18:00,2174,Tell him to suck it up!  I for one don't feel sorry for him  Cheers
133186,Whopper,2007-11-13 18:21:00,2174,  Thanks Wayne .....that didn't sound right...
133187,irishfield,2007-11-13 18:23:00,26272,What..should I have said ...tried to get him to sleep overnight...
133188,douG,2007-11-13 18:23:00,2693,"At 1:15, Glen called to say he was in Whitby, pushing on through to Belleville and then to Merland Park.  I wonder if Merland has a spot for him tonight?  I guess he could sleep in his truck again.  This guy must be a little excited, even tho he didn't sound excited on the phone.  I remember why now, he's from Alabama."
133190,Roy,2007-11-13 18:27:00,13728,Be prepared to see a Confederate flag flying at Merland. And cheese grits fer breakfast....YUM!
133191,Bly,2007-11-13 18:27:00,1556," When I spoke to him, he mentioned that Merland's was supposed to be holding a room for him tonight.  If there's a mixup, then he knows he can head back to our place for the night."
133192,Roy,2007-11-13 18:30:00,13728, These Alabanana dudes all have gun racks in their pickups. There will be no mix up.
133199,ccmtcanada,2007-11-13 18:40:00,7971, 
133202,Whopper,2007-11-13 18:52:00,2174, No worries Wayne I was just busting your chops  I did see Glen yesterday and he is pretty stoked about the BOQ.  Roy he doesn't have a gun rack but he did have about a dozen rods hanging out the back of his truck plus he was sober   so that would explain why he doesn't sound like he normally does douG  So be prepared to defend yourselves
133218,Headhunter,2007-11-13 19:38:00,5703,"Something about a ""banjo on my knee""!LOL HH"
133219,DT10Sam,2007-11-13 19:48:00,480,"Hi Guys,  Well time for an update I had this character come in and I did not recognize him with his shirt on.  here is a pic of him if anyone knows this guy you call and claim him he was last seen hanging around the Yo-Zuri and Rapala lures.     Well Glen made it here safe and sound and I called Merland's and they will be pleased to take care of him for the night until the gang comes up tomorrow and on the weekend. He is all bundled up for our weather.  Regards, Sam"
133220,Roy,2007-11-13 19:50:00,13728,"Thanks for looking after our Sudden friend, Sam."
133243,aplumma,2007-11-13 20:53:00,6896,Y'all make sure you take good care of our Dawg you know he is a national treasure now right. Glen if you need a place to stay on the way back call joe or me we can put you up and would be glad to see you too. I have PM roy our phone # incase you left them at home. Have a good trip and make us proud ( or as close as you can to it).   Art
133249,DT10Sam,2007-11-13 21:02:00,480,"One thing that Glen did mention was that he brought up an extra T-shirt in case he needed it.  Wait until he finds out how the weather changes and he will freeze his butt off. I'm sure everyone will take care of him, he is with a great bunch.  Regards, SAm"
133250,douG,2007-11-13 21:05:00,2693,"I'll look after Glen, make sure he gets tucked in at night, that he dresses warmly, and gets enough to eat. I've already signed the papers."
133251,SlowPoke,2007-11-13 21:13:00,2984, You adopted him?
133258,douG,2007-11-13 21:30:00,2693,"Nope, full title."
133259,Bly,2007-11-13 21:39:00,1556,  Does this include bathing as well??
133280,DT10Sam,2007-11-13 22:29:00,480,"Hey Doug,  Glen was wondering how you would look in camo lingerie and then laughed.  I thought that it might be a little tight on you..........so he backed down from getting you some. Still had a silly grin on his face  .  Regards, Sam"
133356,Daplumma,2007-11-14 01:16:00,1961,bathing??*shudder*
133378,douG,2007-11-14 01:46:00,2693,"Pretty dang sure I got the self-cleaning option, no worries tho since I got the two week free return guarantee.  ""IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, RETURN IT!!!! I MUST BE CRAZY!!!!''"
133429,pikehunter,2007-11-14 03:07:00,1659,"You guys had better take good care of him this weekend, the poor bugger's going to freeze to death up here in the land of ice and snow!  Glad to see that you made it safe and sound GCD."
