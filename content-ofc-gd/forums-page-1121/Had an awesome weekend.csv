132886,Joey,2007-11-12 20:46:00,9122,"Spent the weekend with a small group of OFC'rs and had just a fabulous time.  The weather on the first day was a bit windy but after a great breakfast lakeside we braved it.    But by the afternoon, as you can see, the wind calmed down and the sun came out.    Don and Ruth I really enjoyed your company this weekend    Mr. Eh it was nice meeting you and Pete and Lew, a pleasure as always.    Now to the fish porn.  I hooked this beauty Saturday afternoon and I'm still vibrating from the excitement    The sun went down and then we all headed to dinner.  I can still hear that waitress humming     Sandy, you look fabulous as usual and Adam, thanks again, it really was a super time      Pete, you said I could post this, remember      More fish porn on Sunday.    And Wayne, the net is NOT jinxed    This morning was overcast, but warmer, and we tried for a few more hours so Paul wouldn't go home skunked, but ran out of time and had to check out.  We did notice another boat poaching (as Lew mentioned in this thread).  It was a black Lund and there were three guys and 7 lines.  I took a pic, but it turned out all fuzzy from the zoom  Thanks again everyone, I will remember this trip for a long time.  Joey & Paul"
