133673,irishfield,2007-11-14 22:43:00,26272,You'll find that they are dipped...using nothing but an aluminum rod the size you want. Next you will find that it's cheaper to buy the monster tubes from RedOctober than buying chemicals/plastisol etc. Unless you want to have some custom to you only colours. I was hot to do it myself and even have a source for plastisol right here in town...but then just bought enough from RedOctober to last me quite some time for the cost of a gallon of plastisol and some colourant .  Lots of info here... http://www.tackleunderground.com/index.php
