133076,SlowPoke,2007-11-13 09:15:00,2984,"That is a classic line... adding it to the repertoire!  Count me in Shawn!  By the way Cliff, what is this about Carole not being able to catch fish out of a boat? I think if Carole doesn't mind we should bungee the trophy to one of my planer boards on Sunday!!!  "
133083,Shelley Cooper,2007-11-13 10:20:00,394,Sounds like a great plan...  Count Chuck n I in too...
133087,Dano,2007-11-13 10:36:00,719,sure
133090,Terry,2007-11-13 11:02:00,14456,Im in we should use something that need to be in the picture maybe someone can print off something  with OFC  BOQ 2008  2007...LOL and hand them out when they pay their ten bucks that way all will know the fish was caught that weekend
133100,SlowPoke,2007-11-13 11:52:00,2984," Or, we could do it this year and print off something with OFC BOQ 2007 I find this typo especially funny because I did the same on the London Swill thread! -Brian"
133107,BITEME,2007-11-13 12:46:00,1969,count  percher biteme and pointed in you can give it all as far as im concerned I think just make it saturday and award it at the pot luck have you got my name engraved on it yet
133111,ccmtcanada,2007-11-13 12:52:00,7971,LOL Brian....  I should correct that....we cant catch Walleye from a boat...but I'm sure you'll be sure to change that this weekend!  Oh yeah...and Shawn....maybe we should somehow incorporate OFNCommunity.com on that paper....so that any fish caught would also qualify for the OFC Tourney as well.
133112,Terry,2007-11-13 12:56:00,14456,it's been a tough morning ..lets go with 2007...LOL
133125,Headhunter,2007-11-13 13:56:00,5703,Count me in and I'm with Biteme... give the cash to Tyler! HH
133132,LeXXington,2007-11-13 14:50:00,1928,"Count me in,"
133137,fishnsled,2007-11-13 15:01:00,3520,I'm in and like the others my cash can go to Tyler.
132954,fishindevil,2007-11-12 23:34:00,6254,"Hey everyone i am taking names so i can get a rough idea how many people are going to fish our first ever OFC Live Release Walleye Tournament On Nov 17,18    at our G2G this weekend at merland park,the fee will be 10dollars and there is a big trophy for first place as well as CASH...It will be for longest fish,not by weight,as we are trying not to kill any big spawners,so it is catch & release only,if you plan on keeping the fish you CANNOT ENTER THAT FISH!!!!! you also can fish anywhere in the bay of quinte plus the upper gap & lake ontario on ly !!!!! i will be handing out the forms,and will collect the money as well....so just let me know if you are planning to enter it...this will be alot of fun,and will be great to fish with everyone !!!  AND ONE MORE THING TO ADD,THANKS TO GERRITTS IDEA!!!!!!!! 50% OF THE WINNINGS TO BE DONATED TO FISHING FOR TYLER !!!!!! HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO EVERYONE??? I THINK THATS A GREAT THING TO DO!!!!!!!  SO i welcome everyones feedback,as i said farther down in this post that we will work out the details ,and i will make another post for what works best for everyone,and have everything all worked out by the weekend so any ideas just let me,or us know and we can go from there !!!!"
132956,Mike the Pike,2007-11-12 23:36:00,3421,Count me in Shawn
132957,douG,2007-11-12 23:40:00,2693,Sure.  Odds are pretty good at this point.
132958,Gerritt,2007-11-12 23:45:00,6129,yup.
132959,irishfield,2007-11-12 23:45:00,26272,I'll lower the odds a bit! lol  Me is interested. Bet Dano and Terry as well..since they're in my boat.
132961,ccmtcanada,2007-11-12 23:48:00,7971,Bly and I are in Shawn!
132962,irishfield,2007-11-12 23:49:00,26272,Christ...I'm out then!  Not...
132965,Joey,2007-11-12 23:54:00,9122,"Sure, why not, add Paul and I  Joey"
132970,brifishrgy,2007-11-13 00:02:00,559,a few  questions .. do you have to be staying at Merlands???  what time is measure in??? is it honor system (pic good enough) or do we have to attempt to keep the fish alive in the livewell???
132975,irishfield,2007-11-13 00:14:00,26272,Time is probably a big issue for many. Some will be going home Sunday and others will want to fish 'till dark on Sunday. Should you consider a Saturday only time frame Shawn?
132977,Gerritt,2007-11-13 00:18:00,6129,  a very wise idea Wayne
132978,irishfield,2007-11-13 00:24:00,26272,Figure most everyone will be together Sat night anyhow. During that time fishies on the digitals can be confirmed and the trophy awarded..so it can be strapped to the bow of the boat to show off on Sunday's trolling run !
132986,fishindevil,2007-11-13 00:46:00,6254,"Yes good idea wayne i was going to ask for feedback on several points like what brian said too does everyone have to stay at merland park...so it sounds like its best to have it for one day like you said,as most people will all be together saturday night....theres a few more things to work out as well...i would like some ideas from everyone as well"
132989,irishfield,2007-11-13 00:50:00,26272, You could be stayin anywhere. All you are showing Shawn is a digital picture with a tape measure behind the fish.  Is there some object for the day to be in the picture Shawn? or will we get that advise Friday night?
132995,fishindevil,2007-11-13 00:56:00,6254,"I was going to make forms with it saying  simular to the way we do our OFC COMMUNITY fishing derby for our board ,so it will show the date and a place for a witness ,and the length,and the name,so that can be taken in the picture"
132996,irishfield,2007-11-13 00:58:00,26272,
132999,ccmtcanada,2007-11-13 01:01:00,7971,"Shawn...one thing I've noticed about 8 pound + walleye is that they are all in the area of 30 to 33 inches in size....so it's quite possible for many fish to be tied for top spot.  What about taking a girth measurement as well...maybe not for the photo as we want to get these fish back in the water, but just mark it down on that form.  So..in the case of a tie in length, the girth can be used to break that tie.  Just a suggestion."
133001,ccmtcanada,2007-11-13 01:04:00,7971," LOL...remember,  Bly and I cant catch anything from a boat....so I think you'll be safe.  Our entry is just for donating to Fishing for Tyler....hehe."
133005,irishfield,2007-11-13 01:12:00,26272,Tail pinch or natural static stance of the fish?
133007,douG,2007-11-13 01:16:00,2693,Is there a hyphen in anal retentive?
133009,fishindevil,2007-11-13 01:21:00,6254,"well cliff thats a good idea,and wayne just to the tip of the tail.....LOL..LOL..LOL"
133011,Slug,2007-11-13 01:23:00,5,Count Oldphart and I in for the tourney.
133035,Bitsmith2k,2007-11-13 02:42:00,396,i'll get in on it too..
