133121,lew,2007-11-13 13:39:00,12767,"I've been dropping the odd subtle, little hint around home here lately, to anyone that would listen, that I'd like to upgrade the sonar in my boat next season.  This morning over coffee, the Mrs. casually asked me what make & model of sonar I may be interested in, then asked where they can be purchased.  hmmmm, and how many more days till Christmas ??  Ya gotta luv a woman that pays attention to hints"
133122,Gerritt,2007-11-13 13:44:00,6129,what do you have now Lew?
133123,irishfield,2007-11-13 13:46:00,26272,Are you like me Lew... circle stuff in the fliers and casually leave it on the kitchen table....

133126,Terry,2007-11-13 13:57:00,14456,"hmmm....I was dropping hints that it would be nice to take a trip  last night my bags were packed and she told me to get the heck out  guess I'm not so good at giving  hints.....LOL  just kidding   very nice..think wide, screen colour"
133130,Headhunter,2007-11-13 14:17:00,5703,"It appears that many years of training are starting to pay off! Only question is, who's got who trained! LOL Sounds good Lew... hope you get what you want! HH"
133133,Mike Pike,2007-11-13 14:52:00,1332,Don't forget to act surprised when you open the box!
133135,Zib,2007-11-13 14:57:00,369, What's your secret? You've got her trained well.  For years I've been dropping hints to the wife that I need a new boat & truck but that falls on death ears.
133140,Rich,2007-11-13 15:15:00,3927,She's trying to throw you off! You're getting socks!
133159,mattyk,2007-11-13 16:53:00,2110,very nice Lew.
133173,Joey,2007-11-13 17:49:00,9122,She's a keeper for sure Lew  Joey
133189,crappieperchhunter,2007-11-13 18:25:00,2582,"Sounds like a ""Merry Christmas"" at Lew's house....but here is a little tip a very wise person taught me years ago.  Always,always... no matter the gift... pretend you want the model one version cheaper then I one you really want. Chat it up, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on AND ON...you getting the picture... about how much you would like the cheaper one....it does ALMOST EVERYTHING I need it to do. Then casually mention that the next higher model would really be the cats pajama's but it's just a little more money so it's a little too much for now but....sighhhh...sighhhh...sighhhh...maybe someday.  If you have a good relationship you will get the better one because she will enjoy making you happy and will be so pleased with herself.  If not do what I do. Exchange the cheap one she got you for the one you really wanted after Christmas!!!"
133357,Rizzo,2007-11-14 01:16:00,4754," I actually would want the cheaper one...after all, it's your own money that's paying for it!  Hope you get what you're ""fishing"" for Lew"
133359,irishfield,2007-11-14 01:21:00,26272,Hell no Rizzo. Lew goes fishin every day...he sends his honey to work ! LOL
133361,Dano,2007-11-14 01:22:00,719,   Way to go Lew!
133366,Crazyhook,2007-11-14 01:28:00,1154,"Lew leave the Bass pro catalogue out, worked for me last year  circle a few of those big rubber baits as well eh..."
133367,Dondorfish,2007-11-14 01:29:00,1000,I am definately doing something wrong!   Don
133406,Rizzo,2007-11-14 02:33:00,4754," if this is your arrangement Lew, then I truly feel you deserve the better one!"
