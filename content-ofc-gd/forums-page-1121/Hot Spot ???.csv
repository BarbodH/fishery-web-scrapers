133324,blineboy 1970,2007-11-14 00:11:00,14,Hey everyone  looking to find a lodge to do some large pike fishing next fall. I guess anywhere pretty much in Ontario would be great. There are 8 of us in our group so if anybody has a good spot they would like to share we would appreciate the help. Thanks to all in advance.
