133227,spanky,2007-11-13 20:23:00,195,"check out www.tackleunderground.com i'm also a member there and a handpourer aswell, it's relatively easy but time consuming... it''s quite the addiction"
133252,Basskicker,2007-11-13 21:16:00,421,"Highly addictive and can become VERY costly depending on which materials you decide to use.  Better have good ventilation....in your garage and a mask for the toxic fumes, lots of fun.  I originally set out with the intent to sell...and sell...and sell some more, but I just don't have the time to mass produce...it's so time consuming.  There's no better feeling then catching a fish on something you created from scratch.  Check out tackleunderground.com  Jason"
133323,Milty,2007-11-14 00:11:00,121,Have u tried fishing with them? How well do they work?  do you add scent?  Exactly how long does it take to make a batch?
133335,drwxr,2007-11-14 00:39:00,453,"canadiantire sells same ones, its cheaper just to buy if you need just few, it does get expensive and addictive \, i guess same as tieing flies, lol"
