I have made a list of those I know are attending.. if you dont see your name on the list please mention something in the thread and I will add you to it.  Thanks!  Gerritt.
133004,HTHM,2007-11-13 01:08:00,4082,I am definately coming for saturday if my wife lets me.....
133287,Gerritt,2007-11-13 22:42:00,6129,Bump!
133290,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-13 22:49:00,1351,I think the list may slim down with that nasty weather coming ahead....
133291,irishfield,2007-11-13 23:06:00,26272,Not a chance Kevin..nobody is gonna back out this close. Sunshine..near the freezing mark..a bit of a breeze... all = FISH ON  Smaller boats can fish West of the Ferry as well in sheltered areas. Just pay attention to the wind and pick the shore it favours if your boats a little shy on freeboard.
133293,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-13 23:14:00,1351,"i'm hoping that i can play with you big boys out there, east of the ferry.. apparently it can get real rough real fast."
133306,irishfield,2007-11-13 23:33:00,26272,It can..but there's generally one shoreline you can limp home along if need be..or get someone to bust you a path..that'd be me or Tracker(Don).  Here's a shot of last year on the Friday. Blowin so hard we could only troll down the reach with the wind...then pull everything in and run up the North Shoreline back to the Ferry and repeat x 6 !  
133309,Mike the Pike,2007-11-13 23:46:00,3421,Kevin as long as you don't do like these people you should be ok.They were out among us Nov 2006 in the  Aldolphus Reach  What did you call them last year Wayne ......Jack what?  
133313,irishfield,2007-11-13 23:50:00,26272,Was I that polite Mike ? First word stated with F and second word was 'Tards

133349,Dondorfish,2007-11-14 01:09:00,1000,Dang Percher - I didn't see you out there! I would have stopped by and said hello. And yes Kevin - in was a tad rough - please be safe and use common sense!  Don
133373,Gerritt,2007-11-14 01:40:00,6129,"Jesus.... you guys trying to freak me out!?!
