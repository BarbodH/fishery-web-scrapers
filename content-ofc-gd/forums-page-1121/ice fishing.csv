133566,Fisherman,2007-11-14 14:50:00,7201,"You want ice bungalows close to the GTA?, maybe try the Lake Simcoe board, about as close as you're going to get, don't expect any miracles though. I would go to North Bay area."
133568,Terry,2007-11-14 14:56:00,14456,"I only know of one true bungalow on simcoe, it's on cooks bay and there are perch in the area jumbos at times  but as it's been said North bay for bungalow  what do you want to fish for, it would help narrow the search down and if just a hut will do, then there are lots of places"
133588,lickmyarmpit,2007-11-14 16:27:00,359,"North bay is cool its not too far the only places i could find are glen echo, and another operator up on abitibi which is way too far.  As for species it dosn't matter just something to keep us busy."
