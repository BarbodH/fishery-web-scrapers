Following Irishfields advice on making sure water does not expand in the pump, I have a plug at that end but I came across the problem with the livewell over flow.  It has a thru-hull connector with no threads or anything to attach too. This is well above the waterline, but if any water gets into it, the water will run down too the pump.  Has anyone sealed this with something, It needs to be temporary as I use the livewell in the summer  I was thinking tape but, with the water it would come off,  Thanks  LeXX"
132844,Terry,2007-11-12 18:10:00,14456,"see how big the hole is and I am sure you can by a plug for it, just like your drain plug"
132860,LeXXington,2007-11-12 19:11:00,1928,"Dolt, I hope its not that easy,  I thought about that and looked in CDN Tire and BPO but could only find the ones that are too small,  Guess I will check a marine store for special order, checked on the internet and they do sell them that big enough"
132866,Terry,2007-11-12 19:32:00,14456,"well I have seen the marine type up to 1 1/4 http://www.iboats.com/Boat_Drain_Plugs/dm/...-view_id.257673  plus I have seen them for plumbing up to 2"" so you should be able to do it"
132880,Basskicker,2007-11-12 20:10:00,421,I actually used silicone for mine on both ends.  With a little patience it comes off easy enough and guaranteed not to leak.  Jason
132949,HTHM,2007-11-12 23:07:00,4082,how about a cork? Or a bung from a barrel? Another thought - perhaps a plastic bag with spray foam sprayed into it while it is in the hole.
132980,camillj,2007-11-13 00:32:00,1988,or perhaps a piece of styrofoam with electrical tape wrapped around it
