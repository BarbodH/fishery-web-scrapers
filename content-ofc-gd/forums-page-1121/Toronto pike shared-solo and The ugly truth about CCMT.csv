133482,snag,2007-11-14 06:27:00,1932,"Greetings,  I'll spare Bly the ""Cliff is such a great guy"" post.  He is.  Uh, sorry Carole but he put up with my coffee induced psychotic ramblings for 5-6hrs.  However, I saw a dark side.  There was a dead bloated pike washed up on the rocks. Cliff jumps down and:   Cliff sez with the slick, kitten eating, smile of a politition: ""What happens in T.O. stays in T.O. Take a pic!""  (it's just sickening, I'm sorry Carole. He's not the man you thought.....)   Truth is, and I know those that have fished with Cliff will back me up;  He's anti-climatic!!! Mr.Nonchalant Coooooooooooooooooooooooolll  I am being the consummate host, I'm doing well but I want my guest to catch something and be EXCITED! When he finally caught this fish, it was like he had caught that fish 10000 times before. He's mumbles  ""Fish on""  like a breakfast special at Zellers.  Then he ORDERS; ""Take an action pic of me for my photo journal"" Whatever, kiljoy  Here's your Cliffporn Cliffcateers,  THAT'S HOT!   This is funny though, Cliff was an hour late getting there and I was stuck behind this rockstar loogan for 30 min. (this was AFTER we pulled off the highway!)     Here are some fish I hid from Cliff: (but he would have seen today if he didn't ""work"")  I didn't blur here, my camera sucks.   These (2 mega pix) pictures don't do this pike justice  Lean view   Wee Piggy (they're still eating)     This was amazing, I felt honoured to share this awesome experience with Cliff. We wept as we witnessed such a grace of nature unfolding in an urban setting; Owl necro-feeding on pike corpse;  (Cliff will validate that the owl figure was found on location with the Esox corpse) Gotta love urban fishing garbage.     Cliff earned it. and I don't want any negative PM's He's gets the award for best current guest; The creepy shore wash doll:    Cliff, Carole, anytime you want to go (during the week!) it will be my honour!  Sweet dreams  xooxoxox  S."
133483,bassmastermike,2007-11-14 06:38:00,295,WHat a Riot!!! Looks like you guys had a great day count me in next time too Cliff !!!
133486,Hooked,2007-11-14 06:55:00,891,"SNAG, you kill me.  That was a great POST!"
133491,mikeymikey,2007-11-14 07:59:00,376,what is it between your legs that you had to blur it so much ?
133497,solopaddler,2007-11-14 09:53:00,8605,"""kitten eating smile"" HAHAHA! That's hilarious man! I made the exact same comment to Cliff when he fished with me, ""figured you'd show a little more excitement bud, c'mon!"" Yep there's no doubt the man is coool. Icy in fact. Maybe he's an internet posting android?"
133504,Mike the Pike,2007-11-14 10:41:00,3421,Thanks snag for the chuckle   Now I get to meet him in 48 hours.
133509,fatherof3,2007-11-14 11:07:00,1769,"funny report with some nice fish,thanks for sharing"
133538,TJQ,2007-11-14 13:21:00,7806,LOL.. great post... I don't know whats creepier....  cliff's pose or the doll....
133539,ccmtcanada,2007-11-14 13:30:00,7971,LOL Snag....  At least my dead pike was nicer looking than your dead one from last year!    You're just jealous!!!  Solopaddler and Snag - I'm always excited to catch a fish....I'm laughing and all giddy deep down inside....VERRRY DEEP.  Oh and as for the pike I did catch...it was just a tiny fish....panfish-like.  We'd probably catch more fish if you stopped telling me to come and look at what you've found...I tell ya...must have taken 2 hours away from fishing with you looking in every nook and cranny for interesting garbage.  They do make interesting pictures though...have to admit that.  Those other fish you hid from me are from last years reports.....I checked.  We'll do it all over gain soon.
133541,Roy,2007-11-14 13:37:00,13728,"Great thread, Snag.  I vote that we change Cliff's name to ""Chuckie"""
133557,OhioFisherman,2007-11-14 14:28:00,6623,LOL the birds and chucky? we are all doomed!

133808,snag,2007-11-15 05:05:00,1932,"It's a long story.   He admitted to me that he was ""hyper modest"" when you guys were out. It's our own fault for wanting a ""positive"" reaction.  The android thing is priceless!!!  If posty points were dollars he'd be a millionaire!   Wear protection   me neither   Whatever    Chuckie gets luckie"
133810,snag,2007-11-15 05:12:00,1932," Hope tomorrow (today) is better.  You've always been kind to me and unconditionally supportive in the board.  You deserve more than a smile.  Thanks,  Grant"
