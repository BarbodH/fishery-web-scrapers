133319,mistaredone,2007-11-14 00:03:00,913,Anyone know if the steel head are in the creek?  The water is probably too low.  If anyone could save me the drive in the morning that would be great.  Thanks.

Not that I think anyone here would do this, but even if the conditions were prime in some locations, some may tell you they suck.  I know the drive can be a pain, but sometimes you gotta put the legwork in.  That being said...the tribs I like to frequent in the east end all suck....LOL. (That's the truth)"

133332,huntervasili,2007-11-14 00:35:00,1604,I will second that... havent been down to 16 lately but know our rivers here are low...
133375,aniceguy,2007-11-14 01:42:00,1094,16 mile doesnt get any real push at this point and much of it is sactuary now...and knowing the river its low as mud
133388,Burtess,2007-11-14 02:01:00,901,"Yeah, 16 Mile Creek (Oakville Creek) is closed up tight for trout until the spring opener.  Only part that is open is down stream of the HWY 2 (Lakeshore) bridge....  Burt"
133396,bassfighter,2007-11-14 02:16:00,366,I went there once last year and it was shallow and muddy as others had mentioned.  Sometimes finding a fishable spot close to home is not always positive.
133477,mistaredone,2007-11-14 05:20:00,913,Thanks for the response.  Ill try Bronte tomorrow.  Anyone fishing in the morning?
