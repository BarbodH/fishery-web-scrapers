133798,irishfield,2007-11-15 04:28:00,26272,"Dear Mr. Minister,    I'm in the process of renewing my passport, and still cannot believe this. How is it that Radio Shack has my address and telephone number and knows that I bought a t.v. cable from them back in 1997, and yet, the Federal Government is still asking me where I was born and on what date.  For crying out loud, do you guys do this by hand? My birthdate you have on my social insurance card, and it is on all the income tax forms I've filed for the past 30 years. It is on my health insurance card, my driver's license, on the last eight bloody passports  I've had, on all those stupid customs declaration forms I've had to fill  out before being allowed off the planes over the last 30 years, and all  those insufferable census forms that are done at election times. Would somebody please take note, once and for all, that my mother's   name is Maryann e, my father's name is Robert and I'd be absolutely astounded if that ever changed between now and when I die!  poop!  I apologize, Mr. Minister. I'm really ticked off this morning. Between you an' me, I've had enough! You send the application to my   house, then you ask me for my dang' address. What is going on? You have a gang of Neanderthals workin' there! Look at my damn picture. Do I look like Bin Laden? I don't want to dig up Yasser Arafat, for crying out loud. I just want to go and park my  butt on a sandy beach. And would someone please tell me, why would you give a poop whether I plan on visiting a farm in the next 15 days? If I ever got the urge to do  something weird to a chicken or a goat, believe you me, I'd sure as hell not want to tell anyone!  Well, I have to go now, 'cause I have to go to the other end of the  city and get another bloody copy of my birth certificate, to the tune of $60!   Would it be so complicated to have all the services in the same spot  to assist in the issuance of a new passport the same day?  Nooooo, that'd be too easy and maybe make sense. You'd rather have  us running all over the dang' place like chickens with our heads cut  off, then find some me to confirm that it's really me on the stupid  picture - you know, the one where we're not allowed to smile?!  Hey, you know why we can't smile? We're totally ticked off!  Signed - An Irate Canadian Citizen  P.S. Remember what I said above about the picture and getting someone to confirm that  it's me?   Well, my family has been in this country since 1776 when one of my forefathers took up arms against the  Americans.  I have served in the military for something over 30 years and have had security clearances up the yingyang.   I was aide de camp to the lieutenant  governor of our province for ten years and I have been doing volunteer work for the RCMP for about five years. However, I have to get someone  'important' to verify who I am - you know, someone like my doctor  WHO WAS BORN AND RAISED IN COMMUNIST CHINA!!!"

133824,DT10Sam,2007-11-15 11:44:00,480,"Wayne,  Don't worry about the passport, they only have a ferry up here in Picton and they don't ask for passports.  :clapping:  Look forward to seeing everybody this weekend.  Regards, Sam"
133825,lew,2007-11-15 11:56:00,12767,"I've said it for a long time now Wayne, the more advanced we become with technology, the further behind we get sometimes.  At one time we could just dial a number, ask for Joe Schmuck and you'd be talkin to him in seconds. Now we spend half our lives on the telephone arguing with a computer somewheres.  The good old days, really were"
