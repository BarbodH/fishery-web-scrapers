I have already put a deposit down of 100 bucks for Sunday so those of you who don't have a boat Sunday or want a little more room it will cost you 200 bucks but its well worth it believe me if you look at my avatar thats a picture from last year when we got a double header on his boat. Fishhunter is a top notch Captain and I know a few people on this board can vouch for him. If you are interested shoot me a PM.   Cheers  Geoff"
