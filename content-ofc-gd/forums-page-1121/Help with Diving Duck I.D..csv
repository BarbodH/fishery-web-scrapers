132868,tonyb,2007-11-12 19:36:00,1637,"Unfortunately, one of them decided to eat the minnow that was on my hook and I caught it...(released of course) There were about a dozen of them that were diving and catching baitfish with ease.  They were diving in the inner-harbour and I was fishing on the lake side at Bronte, so I thought I was safe, but the one I caught must have swam a relatively long distance underwater as I was keeping an eye out for them on the surface where I was fishing...  Anyone know what type of Duck these are? The one that I hooked was the black and white looking one on the right...I think they are the same species though male/female?    Tony"
132870,Ron,2007-11-12 19:50:00,1683,"Long tailed duck,  They used to be called Old Squaws. The one in your photo on the left is a juvenile, the one on the right is a hen.    http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds...ailed_Duck.html"
132881,tonyb,2007-11-12 20:12:00,1637,"Thanks Ron!  I thought it was that, but the photo's I saw for that type had a really long pin-like tail.  That photo you posted is a direct match.  Tony"
132882,Roy,2007-11-12 20:15:00,13728,That Ron guy surely knows his birds. Most wildlife for that matter.
132887,Sinker,2007-11-12 20:47:00,8692,"Ron is right, they are Oldsquaws (long tail ducks), except the one on the right is a Drake, and the one on the left is a hen or juvinile. Tough ducks they are, and can dive up to ~300ft!! They are seaducks.  Sinker"
132915,tonyb,2007-11-12 21:35:00,1637,I did some reading and thought this was interesting...  It looks like they over-winter in the Great Lakes...their home range is way WAY up north    Tony
132916,Fishmaster,2007-11-12 21:39:00,920,Got the Long Tail on the wall pretty bird ....
132981,Ron,2007-11-13 00:35:00,1683,  This is a male.
133034,Sinker,2007-11-13 02:38:00,8692,"Yup, and so is the one on the right in the pic. Just not fully plumed yet. They don't all have the long tails. It comes with age, a fully plumed mature drake will have the long tail. A young drake will have no tail, or a shorter one.  I'm not saying your wrong Ron, but the bird on the right in the original pic is a drake old squaw.   Hens are mostly brownish/grey on thier backs. Hardly any white like the bird in the pic.  Sinker"
133049,Rizzo,2007-11-13 03:22:00,4754,"do those ducks have a bad odour?  I know a guy who says ""ducks"" and then a few seconds later there is a really bad smell. Just wondering if they are the same ducks."
133245,Dabluz,2007-11-13 20:55:00,701,The best plummage is in the spring during the mating season.
133247,Dabluz,2007-11-13 20:56:00,701," Yes....those ducks do smell bad.  However, not as noisy as the ""pull my finger"" ducks."
