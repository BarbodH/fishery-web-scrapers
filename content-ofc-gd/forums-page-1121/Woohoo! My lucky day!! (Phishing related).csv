132783,JohnF,2007-11-12 14:36:00,3494," Dayum! Ya beat me out. I was gonna ask if this is his way of saying he was buying at the London Swill. But then I guess he can afford both now, huh? And I think it's kinda self-serving of you to expect him to buy you a floater suit, being as how he lives closer to me and I don't even have a boat yet. I could sure use a trolling motor for that yet to be found boat.  Waytago (Byron - was it?), my old and dearest friend.  JF"
