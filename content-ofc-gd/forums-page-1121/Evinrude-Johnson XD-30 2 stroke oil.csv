133410,Gerritt,2007-11-14 02:37:00,6129,"I did and thank you for the suggestion... I did not pm you because I wanted to talk to you this weekend in person about it.  did you find them uncomfortable?  Thanks for the Oil Wayne, evinrude states for 1993 and newer motors on the XD30... but my motor has VRO removed so I mix... I will ask the dealer when I get a chance if it is suitable. but I would sure appreciate it! as I can use it in a family members motor if not in mine.  G."
