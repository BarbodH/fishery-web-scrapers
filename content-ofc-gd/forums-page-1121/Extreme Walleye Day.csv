Myself and a couple of the Team-X guys had a blast tossing hair jigs for these golden fish over the weekend.  3/16 - 1/4 oz black/red, black/yellow hair jigs did the trick for most of the bigger fish; soft curly tail grubs in perch tones accounted for a few add`l fish when the bite slowed down; 6'3"" and 6'6"" med. action spinning outfits rigged with braid to fluoro leader;  90% of the fish came from 10-14 feet of H20 on slight drops and OUTSIDE edges of the weed- dunked the thick stuff - no walleyes- except for a few fat bronzeback bass and muskie;  late morning and early aft had the best bite; most strikes came 6-8 feet down and we`re sharp, can`t miss ""line-jumping-strikes""  check it out... (gotta go, only 2 days left!!) http://www.extremeanglertv.com/new_flash_r...shreport_29.htm  ( all caught, photographed and released)  K-Dawg.... gone jig rippin` http://www.extremeanglertv.com"
133578,gotfish,2007-11-14 15:35:00,53,Looks like you guys took advantage of that Beauty day yesterday. I hope to get out on Thursday for the last blast and get into a some of the frog feeding freenzey the walleye do this time of year with top water baits. I hope that you guys are really not going to pack it in till spring with the hard water season just around the corner. Great to see and hear that   Dog   Bob  and  Mark are still out poundin the water. That picture will encourage anyone to get out one more time.  Cheers AL

133740,Bob Devine,2007-11-15 02:19:00,251,It was a great day on the water with K-Dawg and Mark as always. The hair jig is slightly different than the vertical jigging on the Detroit River and when the fish hit it is a smash and dash! Those golden 'eyes really look great too.
133845,Chrispy,2007-11-15 13:14:00,168,"Great job Boys!!  Hey Bob, are there any places on the river that we can throw hair jigs??  Shoot me over an e-mail and maybe we can get out in the next couple weeks....  Chrispy!"
