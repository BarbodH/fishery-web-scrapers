131909,Nemo,2007-11-09 17:32:00,727,Great tip thanks. One question is are you going to repaint and if so what are you going to use and how will you prep the aluminum. I would like to touch up my Lund 14ft.  Nemo

132259,duckdog,2007-11-10 23:47:00,162,"Yup the stuff is very nasty and I should have said use all available ppe's, I am not sure if I am going to repaint just the top side or just the bottom yet, I do like the aluminium look but I think the bottom what I will do is strip it right down to bare then 2 part epoxy primer then my bud has some left over marine acrylic enamel to go over top also all that should help seal the bottom"
132421,Greencoachdog,2007-11-11 14:17:00,8163,"Try the citrus strip, works great... biodegradeable and no noxious fumes... available in the paint section at Wally World."
133472,irishfield,2007-11-14 04:39:00,26272,"FYI... for anyone doing this.... you really should use Tal-Strip II (Aircraft coating remover) on aluminum....not the standard stocked ""Tal-Strip"" as it's for metal and really shouldn't be used on aluminum."
