Yeah..cause she's not the one who will get splinters and wreck alot of trees. Anyway..I need a set of plans for something moderately complex in the keepsake box style. Perhaps a memory box or some other kinda name. Any ides where?

If you have little pieces of wood laying around, you can do the joint yourself on a small table saw but it does take a little practice.  I made a decent sized display box for kitfisher on here to take to trades shows.....maybe shoulda got some pics of it.  You can go to home depot and buy glued planks of wood...be it pine, cedar, maple, oak. Saves needing a planer.  Oh ya, if you have a decent sized chunk of wood....f this, ill PM you."
