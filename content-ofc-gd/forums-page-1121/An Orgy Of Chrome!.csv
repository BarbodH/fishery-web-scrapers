133070,discophish,2007-11-13 05:07:00,392,Have the egg sack sponsors contacted you yet?  8-)  Excellent job!  I have never had a day like that in my life.  Very envious.
133081,solopaddler,2007-11-13 10:08:00,8605," Ha that's a good one! I'd love to meet some egg sack sponsors, seems like I'm always the one sponsoring everyone else I'm fishing with LOL!  (Fish were caught on jigs, flies and worms as well as spawn. They weren't being overly picky  )"
132506,solopaddler,2007-11-11 20:04:00,8605,"Yep, don't know how else to describe the last day and 1/2, Saturday we fished from dawn 'till dusk and pretty much hooked fish all day, I felt like I was beat up with a baseball bat by the end of the day, but it was sooo worth it!  . Probably the most sheer fun I've had fishing so far in /07.. This morning was decent as well, but the crowds were brutal compared to Saturday. We fished 'till around 11 then booked it outta there and headed home. I'll let the pic's speak for themselves.                                                  Gotta go ice down my arm now  .  Cheers,  Mike"
