I don't plan on keeping the fish. What do I need to take down? Length? Girth? Weight? Anything else? What kinds of pictures and from what angles etc...?  ALSO... Any recommendations from around the Toronto area to get this done?  I'm guessing this will run me $300-500?  Thanks for any help..."

For a replica they need:  Length Girth Weight  Photos are primarily for colouration of the fish.  Just a few pics of the entire fish is all they need.  If there are distinguising marks on the fish...like scars etc, they suggest a pic of that area.  As far as cost is concerned, 300 to 500 may be a bit conservative.  Bly caught a 32"", 15 pound Walleye last year and estimates we got were somewhere between 600 and 900 bucks depending on what it's mounted on.  Most places we talked to quoted by the inch....and a trophy walleye will be 30+ inches.  Talk to DTSam when you're in Quinte....his place is doing Taxidermy now....they are located in Belleville."
133224,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-13 20:14:00,1351,hmm.. 600-900.. eh.. YIKES... maybe i'll just got mount a sunfish if its by the inches.. hahha

They do fiberglass replica's and they are also the most expensive but for once in a lifetime trophy, its worth it.  i got my 36 inch pike and my dad's 50 inch muskie from them.  They get contracts from all over the world and are on contract with our MNR for record Ontario fish.  Walk through their showroom and you will be AMAZED at the quality of their work and the variety of fish and animals."
