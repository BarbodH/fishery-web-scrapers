Let me stop moving though and one or sometimes all of them gather around and taste me, constantly. LOL I thought it was the FF thing, taste like a pork chop.  I got up this morning and my wife had left a page from her Boston Terrier calender at my place on the table. Under the picture a notation "" Dog saliva contains certain enzymes that help to disinfect and heal wounds"".  http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF12/1234.html  LOL a couple dogtors running around the house and I had no clue!"
133599,Hookset,2007-11-14 16:48:00,367,"Yep, they have some pretty powerful saliva.  Only thing ya gotta watch is... what they were licking or eating, before they lick you.  Mine is pretty darn disgusting so no kissy face for me thanks.   Hookset."
133603,Jay T,2007-11-14 17:06:00,282,  You got that right. I swear my lab thinks it's parts are lollypops   it is just nasty. Just the noise alone drives me crazy. But you gota love em.
