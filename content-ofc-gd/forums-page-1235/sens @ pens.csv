58828,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-11 23:25:00,108,GO PENS GO!
59108,blaque,2007-04-12 14:39:00,2419,"C'mon pittsburg, ya gotta get those butterflies out and make a series out of this!! Good to see they got some positive outsome as the game went on. Hopefully they can gain from that. Cant believe they called sid's goal back. Not sayin it was a drop dead goal, it was iffy though, and they called it a goal on the ice. Ive seen more distinct intent before that were goals, in comparison, that was weak."
59120,Northhunter,2007-04-12 14:54:00,214,"I was surprised they called it back, too. Before the series started I woulda said Pittsburgh to take it. But I dunno... Ottawa looked pretty sharp last night.   Anyone see the 'Nucks - Stars game? 2 minutes away from the 5th overtime before it finally ended! (yes, I watched it)."
59124,specktacklure,2007-04-12 15:09:00,56,Goal should have been called back.And it should have been a penalty for goaltender interference.Young guys can't handle the pressure Sens in five no problem !!! Sens saved their best for the playoffs and are peeking at the perfect time WATCH OUT SIDNEY LOL
59130,misfish,2007-04-12 15:21:00,29133,It will go 7.  Young team. Time for larock to lay the hammer down on Niel. Niel should never score.
59149,blaque,2007-04-12 16:14:00,2419,"Just wish the calls could be consistant, but throwin ""man"" into anything makes that a little impossible.  nice little clusters of hits last night after the 6th goal was scored. Thats what i like to see.........definitely think Laroque should have thrown his body around sooner. Id look for a more settled pens team next time out. And yes, Neil should not be puttin pucks in the net. No one needs to see that stupid smile on his face lol"
59168,carll2,2007-04-12 17:02:00,443,awesome game lets see what happens saturday i say sens take the series in 5 games
59183,Puckhead,2007-04-12 17:35:00,377,"If the series is wrapped up in 5, sens win, if it goes 6 or 7, sens will choke as usual.  They will fold like a cheap suit if any pressure games are played.  Happens everytime and I see no reason for it not to happen again this year."
59299,charlied,2007-04-12 21:34:00,584,"yes I watched too...what a game... best game of the night.  i watched all the other games....every team played awsome except pittsburgh last night...hense the beating, watch out when they get there bearings straight thou.  Funny how Ottawa booos the best player in the league and other teams are complaining cause of the regular season scheduling adn wanna see him play in there town...LOL"
