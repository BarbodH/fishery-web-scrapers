49341,Bernie,2007-03-19 22:33:00,3190,Wow..Lots of great pictures. Way to go gang.  These are not particularly photogenic shots but ones that I'm proud of my son Nick and also my apprentice Ash who built cars for our local fall fair demolition derby. They both built great cars. Ash was second overall and was a big crowd pleaser. Unfortunately Nick lost battery connection and was eliminated early. These derbys are a lot of work to prepare for but a riot to do.

It's difficult to narrow it down!  Here are two shots, both taken last summer at my boyfriends cottage, in the back bay behind and at one of our favourite fishing spots, aptely named "" Sunset Bay""  The time we've spent there has definitely been the most memorable and special time of my life to date!!

49096,lew,2007-03-19 14:29:00,12767,"I've posted this one before but I always liked the way it turned out considering it was just a fluke.  I was running down the lake wide open early in the morning doing about 75 KPH and as the sun popped up over the horizon, I just held the camera up over my shoulder and clicked the shutter without even turning around.  Luv the way the water sparkles off the water droplets.   "

Just got a digi cam in the fall, never had a camera before, seen this rattler and a few bears swimming 3 days in a row in October swimming to Islands, but didn't get any good shots of a bear, also one bear was in a cottage on an Island, my dad and the contractor that takes care of the cottage had to go kill it, it wouldn't leave the house, and he tore everything up, looked like a keg party the day after.

No point risking the feds comin after you trying to fine you the $250K that they threaten these days out on Beausoli Island PPark for killing a Massasauga. I remember the owner in 3 lakes campground in Parry Sound trying to tell me my youngest almost picked up a Hognose snake, when I asked him to move it off our site. Told him if that's all it was to pick it up himself and move it...he refused! I find them just about every year here in the yard. Never pick a board up in the sun without using a stick/shovel.  Now if we'd all re-read his original post....picture of YOU doing something..."

Here's a closer shot.  Smoke scatters the crowd when he leaves the garage area and when he returns from the track.  This was taken October 26, 2002, either the last race or last year garage passes were available to racing fans.  It was an exciting morning for me.  "
