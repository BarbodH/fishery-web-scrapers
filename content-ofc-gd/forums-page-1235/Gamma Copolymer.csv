59237,bassmaster4,2007-04-12 20:05:00,801,Has anyone used gamma copolymer? Is it good? Is it like Monofilament? Is there any other mono anyone reccomends? Thanks  Bassmaster4
59341,FishHeadRic,2007-04-12 22:37:00,226,Haven't used the Gamma co-poly but I've been using the Yo-zuri and P-Line ones. Very good lines.  FHR
59369,xrap,2007-04-13 00:17:00,683,I use the 6lb test. Strong stuff and not to expensive. It's really good line.  and as fish head said the p-line is also strong stuff.
59379,bassmaster4,2007-04-13 00:48:00,801,strong enough to use 6 lbs test for pike and bass?
59380,FishFinder,2007-04-13 00:49:00,481,"i use the 12 and 10 lb, great line but not that much different from regular mono"
59381,FishHeadRic,2007-04-13 00:51:00,226,Not for pike. I wouldn't even use it for bass. Go with at least 10lb for the pike. Bass I'd suggest at least 8lb.   FHR
59383,bassmaster4,2007-04-13 00:54:00,801,Alright thanks.
59414,xrap,2007-04-13 01:47:00,683,I have my power pro for bass and pike. But I have use gamma for pike and bass did just fine.
59523,Blake,2007-04-13 13:30:00,418,Go with P - Line Cxxx this strong line or try the FIN'S Evolution.
