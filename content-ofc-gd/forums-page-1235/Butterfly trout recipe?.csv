59664,Daplumma,2007-04-13 21:14:00,1961,I have 3 butterfly rainbow trout fillets marinating in a lemon butter dill marinade and want to cook them indoors cause my grill is out of gas.How long and what temp?Should I cover them in a baking dish or broil them?Any ideas? I usually wrap them in foil and grill them for a bit. Joe
