The obvious sign of infection was a blinking icon in the system tray that popped every three minutes advising that spyware had been found, and directing me to another site to buy anti spyware software.  Norton and AdAware couldn't see it.  If you find this, see if you can find a tool called SmitFraudFix, follow the instructions, all better now."
