I have 2 brackets on my boat that have cracked due to stress or just plain installed to tight. One part is attached to the boat the other part too the seat mounts with a crack down the middle.  I spoke to the dealer for my boat and they said to drag it too Barrie leave it for a couple weeks and it will be all fixed under warranty, I figure just the gas too drive there would be more than the cost of doing the work never mind the leaving the boat for a couple weeks,  So I ask them, its only 2 brackets about 5 inches long, that is not related to hull structure can I find a local person to do this without voiding the warranty sure they tell me.  So is there anyone who has welding skills in Mississauga that has some free time in the next 2 weeks to weld 2 brackets.  Please PM me.   Thanks LeXX"

59786,taper,2007-04-14 02:01:00,611,I am just wondering are these parts steel or aluminum. If they are aluminum you probably want some one that has a TIG welder.
59806,fishindevil,2007-04-14 02:40:00,6254,Yes i was led to believe that you could only use tig welding for aluminum welding ...i thought thats what it is am i correct???      cheers oh and good luck with the welding job...
59840,Big Cliff,2007-04-14 09:45:00,6899,"MIG Welding was originally developed for welding aluminum and other non-ferrous materials in the 1940s. You just need the right wire and gas mixture (and a bit of experience LOL). My son has all three.  TIG is most commonly used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and light metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys, It could be used on aluminum boats and supports but it is a slower process and better suited to small, very thin sections. (besides, my son doesn't have a TIG welder LOL)."
