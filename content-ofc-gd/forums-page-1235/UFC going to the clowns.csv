58817,fliptheslop,2007-04-11 23:16:00,112,"What is the UFC thinking,are they going to turn this into a joke like the wrestling.Thursday night Tito Ortis vs Dana White, so much for it being a pure sport"
58925,Greencoachdog,2007-04-12 01:00:00,8163,  YOU TAKE THAT BACK RIGHT NOW JED CLAM PIT!!!...Wrasslin' is so REAL!!!   BTW... remind me to show you my Bulldog-Nelson sometime...
58927,charlesn,2007-04-12 01:00:00,551,This is an exhibition boxing match that was supposedly a stipulation that Ortiz demanded in order to return to the UFC after his initial contract dispute and his time away from the UFC.  I wouldn't get too bent out of shape over this.  Charles
58955,xrap,2007-04-12 01:11:00,683,Gonna be pretty funny to see white in the octagon.   But it only takes only lucky punch you never know...
58956,Corey,2007-04-12 01:11:00,355,"Exactly what charlsen said. Tito was the one who wanted a boxing match added between himself and White, which was actually done back in December.  Close your eyes if you don't want this spoiled. Tito didn't show up for the weigh-in the day before, nor did he show up for a fight.  This show tomorrow night is just the weeks before the fight was supposed to happen of camera crews following the 2 around.  This was not a gimmick by the UFC, but a cranky whine by Tito, who didn't even follow through with it.  cd."
59075,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-12 13:04:00,396, umm. can jenna even give him any after her 'reconstructive' surgery?
59082,Bob Apple,2007-04-12 13:34:00,37,"I'm not sure where your getting that its a joke, it is a real exhibition boxing match, sactioned and everything. They are going to let people watch it only on the internet at ufc.com, if it happens! Dana is a big talker, and Tito is a big mouth and good fighter, I can't wait to see it!  Thats why we Fight the Fights!"
59088,fliptheslop,2007-04-12 13:44:00,112,"Dana White, what hes a contender, if its not an advertising ploy than if the earlier post about Tito not showing up is not true and why would white fight unless to draw a crowd, but im sure no way would anyone ever think that such an event would ever be all about ratings.Cant wait for Hulk Hogan to come save the day, or better yet Mini me vs Joe rogan"
59097,charlesn,2007-04-12 14:07:00,551,"It's a tv show, of course it's all about ratings.  What show isn't?  I too heard Tito didn't show up because of the risk factor (he could conceivably get hurt or injured) and it being an exhibition he was getting paid enough to fade the risk.  But it wasn't a ""fixed"" outcome similar to WWE.  Dana White was an amateur boxer and based on Ortiz's stand up skills (or lack thereof) it could have potentially been very embarassing for Tito and that might also be part of why he bailed.  Charles"
59099,Bob Apple,2007-04-12 14:11:00,37,"I can see your point that it is all about the rateings, but really if you know the history of the two, they hate each other and want to beat each other up, they both have huge egos and think they can do anything."
59100,fliptheslop,2007-04-12 14:12:00,112,"Still not sure,Im old and fat, but still think I might fight Dana in my garage with the doors closed, for the right price, now thats entertainment   Clampit could ref. it"
59265,sea nymph,2007-04-12 20:50:00,8,"Like was previously mentioned. Tito asked for this to be in his contract or he wouldn't re-sign with the ufc. And yes tito did pull the shute and not show up, for fear of injury or losing. Dana whites boxing record is 19-3 or pretty close to that. Basically tito was afraid to look like a chump cause his stand up isn't all that great. There was also rumour that tito thought he was getting paid and the event was supposed to be for charity so he didn't show.  This i can believe tito wouldn't do anything without getting paid."
59270,fliptheslop,2007-04-12 20:58:00,112,"My point is to me I see it as a hocky gimmic, I watch UFC and injoy it because to me it wasnt hocky,this just makes me feel they may go the same path as wrestling"
59881,Crazyhook,2007-04-14 14:08:00,1154,"the real reason Tito did not show was he did not have a contract and Dana and the UFC were making all the money off the fight, He wanted a piece of the cash and since he was making none he did not show - Source Tito Ortiz"
