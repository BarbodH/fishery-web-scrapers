59272,silvio,2007-04-12 21:02:00,433,Hey everyone i have a dvd burner with the nero program. I have a few fishing videos on my comp that I would like to burn on a disc I cant seem to find the program that is used to burn a video from you comp to a blank dvd disk. can someone help me please
59300,vance,2007-04-12 21:35:00,719,Which version of nero do you have?  vance
59308,Terry,2007-04-12 21:50:00,14456,unless it's an old nero you go to dvd then to make own dvd then add video files then burn or if you just want to store them on a dvd just burn them as data
59321,leafland,2007-04-12 22:07:00,15,"Hey Silvio  Ok so heres what ya need ""well that works for me""  1st find the WinAvi Converter / converts AVI, DVD, WMV, VCD etc.... to what ever you want, great proggy to have to convert! You can get it of software sights that you can DL from, or use a Torrent Program like UTorrent or Azureus and get that installed on your PC then lastly go to ISO Hunt and search for WINAVI CONVERTER I like the Torrent and ISO way best. Once you have the Program you can convert the file you have to DVD etc.... and open your nero click DVD, choose DVD-Film or VIDEO versions very, click on all the ""CONVERTED FILES"" that you did with WINAVI . When I get back home I will  add a few links if your still snagged!  hope this helps  cheers leafland"

59389,mrdylan,2007-04-13 01:05:00,111,Last couple years Avi and DivX players have dropped in price are you sure your player can't play them first? You can fit alot more on a disc leaving them the way they are and converting does not always have great results.  As above though Nero can convert them itself you just want to use the standard Nero app and follow the steps.
59426,mepps,2007-04-13 02:09:00,1301,"I user Nero Vision to make DVDs, you can import a variety of files (AVIs and such) and then you  can add chapters and make your movie compliation.  You can even do simple menus."
59488,Corey,2007-04-13 09:50:00,355,"Not to be a stickler here, but Nero can be had from the manufacturer's website located here...  http://www.nero.com/enu/index.html  I am not sure that it's wise to post instructions on how to download an illegit version of anything on a forum such as this. It's not that expensive...  cd."
