Does anyone know if the ice is out?  I usually go out of Atherley, but i'm always open to suggestions.  Last year we caught tons of perch, but not too many big ones.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot.   lovetofish"

58598,Terry,2007-04-11 17:15:00,14456,there are some open spots on cooks too some rain and high winds might do the trick
58660,cantermore,2007-04-11 18:42:00,49,I am heading up this weekend to Atherley; I can let you know Saturday night... I think the narrows is open for sure & some of the part feeding into Couch  Johnny
58661,lovetofish,2007-04-11 18:43:00,500,Thanks a lot guys!  I'm dying to get out.
59916,fishboy,2007-04-14 15:58:00,550,There are open areas (especially the narrows) and the ice is piling-up on shore.  Some real die-hards have had boats in but there's tons of ice and the usal floating garbage from the slobs who can't haul their junk in from the ice.
59933,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-14 17:46:00,108,"The first fishing trip of the 2007 Season was CRAP! We went to a place called Half-way Haven Marina (off Simcoe). Landed ONLY one Crappie (10"") and three Perches (longest being 9.75""). Horrible! The Indian lady charged us $5 a head since it was our first time there. Her regular charges (for the purchase of coupons) to use her docks were: 5 coupons/$50; 10 coupons/$75; 20 coupons/$100. Each time you go to the place, there is a drop off box for either $10 per person or one coupon per person."
59947,irishfield,2007-04-14 19:08:00,26272,Well you got in for half price....wasn't that bad! If you had of paid full price you would have got two crappies and six perch!
59962,Terry,2007-04-14 21:11:00,14456,"yeah but she  only charges people to use her docks, not to catch fish, so you got what you paid for...lol sorry.......but sometimes that is the best place on the whole river to catch them..but it's a crap shoot, make that a crappie shoot.......I heard that this week they were catching them at alberts marina with is a bit before that place on the right"
