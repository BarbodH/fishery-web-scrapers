It was my birthday too which made it that much sweeter to win GM 1.  Few Pics from warmups.......I'm not really sure who 87 is for Pittsburgh, he must be a late call-up from the minors or something?   If you're wondering why Fleury played so poorly, I got in his head bigtime!   Not sure why the Sens came out flying? The place was ELECTRIC!   Nice action shot from the second period.   And remember..... "

59354,Abberz,2007-04-12 23:05:00,140,"  Thanks. I just got rid of them....you should try to make it to a game, 100 times better atmosphere than the ""Suit's"" at the ACC in TO.  Enjoy the series guys and gals!"

59592,Puckhead,2007-04-13 18:05:00,377,"Nice pics!  Would have been nicer if it was the ACC, but what the heck, a couple of Sens playoff games never hurt anyone. (except Sens fans... )  Enjoy it while it lasts Ottawa..."
