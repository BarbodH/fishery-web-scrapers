59797,sturgman,2007-04-14 02:15:00,249,"I asked the same question here the other day T.J  And a few of the members have said the smelts could start running anytime after a good hard rain.. Andy and I are hopefully smelting in Britt next Saturday and your more than welcome to tag along. If the smelts arent running when we get there I guess we'll just have ta drink carlings all night buy a fire. eat jalapeno kippers, fart, and tell stupid jokes all night!"

59893,kuhaman,2007-04-14 14:58:00,503,I thought they swam? Just kiddin. We have a cottage on lake Huron and the smelt run was at about this time but I haven't seen any in the last 6 springs.
