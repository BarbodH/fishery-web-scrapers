59582,Dutch,2007-04-13 17:08:00,831, Great first post....welcome to the board!
59583,Roy,2007-04-13 17:11:00,13728,"Dutch ""LipDip"" is one of the originals on this board. Can't really tell by his name, but there are several hints in his writing style. Welcome again, JP."
59584,Puckhead,2007-04-13 17:22:00,377,Dip shoots from the hip and calls it how he sees it - no question about it!  Nice to see you posting again bro...
59587,misfish,2007-04-13 17:50:00,29133,I promised to behave.  Tightlip.
59596,Harrison,2007-04-13 18:20:00,2202,"Ya, what LipDip said...  SonHarri  ""icin 'appen when da puck"""
59599,Raf,2007-04-13 18:32:00,3495,Team WD40 is proud.  Give 'em hell buddy.  nawdboost
59600,Terry,2007-04-13 18:34:00,14456,"funny I found it lame  in my world everyone doesn't target OOS fish people don't take pictures to boost ones own ego(stat sheets) in my world we don't need to tell little white lies  a couple of years ago when I took that kid out fishing for his very first time and he happened to catch an OOS bass I didn't snap the picture for ego, to show the world or to hold on to it till season opened it I didn't snap the picture to show the fish I took the picture to show the face, the pure joy in a kids face after catching the first fish he ever caught the fish was secondary at best any time I take pictures it to remember the trip the joy, to save a moment in time  when the guy down the road from me came and told me that he caught what he thinks is a bass and he said it was a monster..I told him it would be out of season he said yeah he thought that and let it go, but said it was the first time he caught something other then sunfish and bullheads said he would show me when he got the film done yup it was a 5lb large mouth,,,and by the smile on his face you could see that it was the hi-lite of his fishing to that point..  and in your world you find something wrong , or deceptive with that well I will stay in my world where the smile on ones face is what the picture is about"
59605,Heybud_e,2007-04-13 18:47:00,208,"nicely said Terry,  the picture is worth 1000 words, i couln't agree more... Bud"
59606,kingofthesteelhead,2007-04-13 18:48:00,140,Hi I am new to this board and I do not agree to pictures or reporting of out of season fish. The reason for this is there are too many people doing this on purpose especially  for bass.
59610,lew,2007-04-13 19:00:00,12767," Now, THAT's really getting carried away isn't it , you don't want people to even SAY they caught a fish outta season ??  Wow, things are really getting out of hand now"
59614,Puckhead,2007-04-13 19:08:00,377,No kidding...
59615,Golfisher,2007-04-13 19:10:00,586,Mark me down for Terry's world.
59616,ccmtcanada,2007-04-13 19:12:00,7971,"My next report....  ""I may or may not have gone fishing yesterday.  I may or may not have caught some fish.  If said fish were caught, they may or may not have been in season.  Said fish were nice, but I may or may not have taken any pictures, but believe me when I say that they were HUGE fish (if I caught them and they were in season).  Also I may or may not have released them all to avoid any confusion.  Had a great day out there...Hope you liked my report (or maybe not)."""
59625,Roy,2007-04-13 19:23:00,13728,"Well, that just about covers it folks. This rant was very professionally done and so I thank the usual suspects. See you all next April for the 7th annual OOS rant.  BTW, we've only got a few weeks to get the last two rants in so let's make these last two count. Thanks for the participation."
59510,Terry,2007-04-13 12:36:00,14456,"well the MNR with the new regs..when every they come out are opening up even more year round and early season bass fishing..so I guess they don't believe their our experts.. but really I don't dissagree with anything your wrote this time.. and I would never tell or want people to target OOS fish, I don't take pictures of OOS fish and I know better then posting them here.... but   you and I know an OOS fish means nothing.. but  you have a 8 year old kid out fishing for pike and he catches a OOS bass 7lbs and a picture will mean a lot to him just to prove he caught the thing......  I understand the need to encourage people not to play around with OOS fish but  I see nothing in the law that makes it illegal..moral..well that's a different argument  for a different day"
59513,largemouth,2007-04-13 12:48:00,112,"It maybe or may not be illegal, since everyone interprets the loosely written regs differently its hard to say and in many cases it boils down to officer discretion, so to me taking a picture of a OOSF is only illegal if you get caught. Posting it on OFC is not allowed. Taking a picture of a in season fish thats under the slot could fall into the same category if your an bitter anal-retentive CO, but it wouldn't stop me. Even though doing 1 or 2 kph over the limit is illegal I doubt anyone including the police/CO’s etc really give a crap. It’s just a big waste of time like this thread."
59518,Hookset,2007-04-13 13:12:00,367,"When not keeping fish of any species. OOS or not, it is more important how the fish is handled than anything else. If the fish is handled with care, you have your camera ready, it can take as less than 5 seconds to take a picture. It appears that most negativity about this topic has come from a ""holier than thou"" type of crowd. Catch the fish, handle it carefully, take a QUICK pic if you like, then revive and release. Don't post the pic on the board because obviously people who you would never see post otherwise are suddenly preaching to the choir.  As far as too many Bass goes. There will only be too many Bass when they start getting ahead of me in line at Tim Horton's.  Hookset."
59526,Joey,2007-04-13 13:37:00,9122,    Funny stuff Hookset.  Joey
59533,Squid,2007-04-13 13:40:00,1656,"Gees MOB posts an apology thread and it turns into a RANT. C'mon people, give your heads a shake. Leave the EGOS at the keyboard and just thank MOB for his honesty and action. WTG MOB good job"
59534,Northhunter,2007-04-13 13:43:00,214," Funny. I've been picking up more pickeral in the mid-late summer bass spots in recent years. I think it has something to do with the habits the fish that are being stocked at this end develop, but who knows for sure...  I believe the same thing with the ice fishing. The reduced limit and the slot were needed with the added pressure and have really helped, although the 3-4yr fish really get hammered and a lot get taken out the year before they would first spawn. I was involved in some work near the South River about a year and a half ago and the majority of the 'eyes we netted were in the slot.  I think the walleye fishery should peak in 3-5 years."
59542,Pigeontroller,2007-04-13 14:04:00,2793,Is it legal to take pics of OOS fish? Whos cares!   Should you take pics of OOS fish? NO!
59543,TJQ,2007-04-13 14:11:00,7806, I totally agree.......
59545,bigfish1965,2007-04-13 14:15:00,3382," Richard, there's nothing to suggest that handling a walleye OOS is any less injurious than handling a 22"" walleye that is out of slot. How about fish caught after a limit is reached? Again...illegal to possess. The same would then apply to someone catching a musky on a Conservation license. Illegal for them to posssess the fish, but if a picture is done in a timely and careful manner, it is no different. The argument is rather weak considering we have many lakes in Ontario where the seasons are different on different parts of the lake. Like I said I can go to Port Dalhousie right now and walleye is open year round in parts of it, and closed till May 1st in other parts of it. Would my handling of a fish from the south side be more injurious than handling a fish from the north side? The laws apply to possession and targetting only. Some would also argue that catching a fish with a guide also 'doesn't count'. I doubt you would share that philosphy."
59547,Squid,2007-04-13 14:32:00,1656,Hmmm I wonder who is going to get the last word in???
59548,Puckhead,2007-04-13 14:35:00,377,"My PB Smallie was OOS...  Wasn't intentional and let me tell you, if I had a camera near by, I'd have taken a picture of that hog - and it counts all the same to me as I caught it, and it was freaking huge.  If you're worried about hooking into an OOS fish by accident, don't fish until all seasons are open.  15 seconds to 30 seconds, quick picture, whatever, it's all symantecs.  Damage is already done once that fish was pulled off that spawning bed."
59551,Harrison,2007-04-13 14:44:00,2202,"Legal matter vrs Ethics.  Though it may not be illegal to take an OOS photo, it is unethical to post the success of an OOS catch as you are inadvertently promoting the act itself, IMO.  MOB, great post."
59553,SHAD,2007-04-13 14:55:00,134,"I caught this guy the other day and I don't even know if it's in season but I took a pic of it cause it tried to bite me    If anything, oos catches are good practice for catch and release techniques  "
59580,LipDip,2007-04-13 16:52:00,39,"Your stat sheet is that weak that you need to show pics of fish caught before their season opened?! No pics of nice ones when the season is open or that were caught on purpose?! If you're THAT hard up for a little fame, maybe watch the photo background for trees or snow etc and wait until the season's open to post. White lie. Don't be surprised when guys call you on it, you assume the risk by uploading and posting. If it's that big of a thrill to catch a fish out of season, maybe just hang the pic in your home instead on on the internet. Class move MoB, and the report was good! Personal decisions have always done a lot more than any law or law maker ever will."
59401,ch312,2007-04-13 01:28:00,1590," and that about sums it up right there.  one thing though, is it against board rules to post pics of fish that are in season, but not legal to keep due to slot regulations?"
59404,Terry,2007-04-13 01:30:00,14456,"DanC,  it is illegal to fish for spawning fish, so the taking of pictures would be the lest of his problems  and in this neck of the woods most honest people will tell you that most OOS fish are caught well before the spawn when they come in to eat after winter and while fishing for in season fish the OOS fish get caught because they are eatting not spawning... the OOS fish equals spawning fish is crap ..bass are out of season for well over half the year but only spawn for a few weeks..so statements of OOS = spawning fish are from misinformed people or people trying bending the truth to prove a point  I will bet that I have not caught an OOS fish that was spawning in over 20 years, but have caught lots of oos fish while fishing for legal fish............"
59406,danc,2007-04-13 01:33:00,4677,"The difference, as I see it Rick is that OOS fish are most likely spawning, congregated and vulnerable. An out of slot fish can be caught at any time during the open season, and it's immediate release is less of a concern. Legal or not, release any OOS fish asap without a photo IMHO. If there's any time that we should not bother them, it's when they are reproducing. The future of fishing depends on it."
59407,Roy,2007-04-13 01:37:00,13728,"Master of Bait,  I do believe that it's my turn to apologize to you on behalf of some of the members of this board.  As for calling Muskies Canada for them to put up a sign begause there are ""probably a bunch of them lying around""...I think that there are enough MCI people on this board that there shouldn't need to be a phone call made.  Again, you did good MoB."
59408,Terry,2007-04-13 01:38:00,14456,"I disputed your argument before you wrote it....lol  and again harassing(fishing for) spawning fish is illegal, so of course no one would take a picture of them your argument just doesn't hold water"
59410,irishfield,2007-04-13 01:43:00,26272,"..and I was begining to think it wasn't April....but we've proved that for the 4th year in a row here now. (my MNR letter is even dated April 10th lol)  And what Roy said and MoB, I'm sorry I joined the ""band wagon""."
59413,douG,2007-04-13 01:46:00,2693,"Master of Bait,  not to worry, but we all appreciate your attitude.  It is not against the rules of this board to post oos fish pics.  'We would prefer that you don't', mainly because of this crap.  On the other hand, this is always a good argument.  No it's not, it's a discussion.  It is not a discussion, very clearly an argument.  Oh yeah?  Well let's take this one outside, jerk.  Want some, goof?  Hilarity ensues."
59415,Mike the Pike,2007-04-13 01:50:00,3421,"Ok I will not post pics of OOS fish.If the Quebec regulations do not state no picture taking, would I be aloud to post a Pic on this site.  Every year I accidently hook into bass usually take a quick pic if its a decent size.  Just looked in the rules for Quebec.That rule is not there unless I did not find it.  undefined"
59416,Roy,2007-04-13 01:51:00,13728,"I betcha that right here on my hard drive I have 200 pictures of under legal sized muskies caught, photoed and prehaps released by guides. I'm tired of this argument. By the way, most are membrs of the same Bearers of the Standard for Muskies club. Give me a break."
59417,Joey,2007-04-13 01:51:00,9122,I always look forward to the April OOS fish argument thread too DouG.  Makes for easy reading and passes some time  Joey
59422,Mike the Pike,2007-04-13 02:00:00,3421, Joey glad we have this thread i have six inches of snow outside and I am supposed to take my boat out of storage this weekend.We won't see any out of season pics because were still in the wrong season.I am not sure I will be seeing ice out in 2 weeks on my chosen lake.Its still snowing like mad.   
59423,fishdawg,2007-04-13 02:01:00,912,"geeezz people,  go fishing already!"
59428,bucktail,2007-04-13 02:11:00,1857,"Rick is correct.  An out of season fish is not a spawning fish. 4 years ago we went to Dalrympal and caught 50 bass on the pike openor. We fished from 2-15 feet ...they were everywhere. We moved constantly and always hooked up on them. Water temp was 52........ this coincides with the first pre spawn feeding binge of largemouths. This does not make us poachers but victims of timing. Largemouth spawn when the temps approach 65. Pictures were taken as we unhooked many largemouths. Fish were released as soon as possible. People should vent on the low lifes that do this on purpose, IE: using no leader on June 5th while ""fishing"" for muskies. People need to chill out and not think that everyone is out raping the resource. Odds say that if the post here there most likely law abiding anglers. Give the guy or girl some credit. Sorry bu this topic gets my hackles up."
59431,Roy,2007-04-13 02:14:00,13728,"Well said, Bucktail."
59433,Raf,2007-04-13 02:15:00,3495,why post them at all? commit them to memory and your personal photo album and leave it at that.  they are OOS.
59435,danc,2007-04-13 02:18:00,4677,  Sensible reply RAF. Thanks.
59439,muskymatt,2007-04-13 02:25:00,2608,Just a question ...  Is there not a difference between a fish that is OOS and a fish that is just not legal size (slot size)....seems like two different scenarios to me ...  JMO  Matt
59444,Joey,2007-04-13 02:51:00,9122,"On a similar note, and I'm serious here, does anyone think the bass population is starting to get out of control?  Just curious what your thoughts are.  Joey"
59445,Heybud_e,2007-04-13 02:54:00,208,"well i can agree with ya, last july during my fishing trip to elliot lake i have caughten more than usual, still only kepted my personal limit of 3..."
59446,danc,2007-04-13 02:57:00,4677,"  They're out of control up here Joey. Darn things are everywhere and nobody fishes for them. Seriously. I can't remember ever hearing anyone that I know saying that they're ""going for bass"" this weekend. Or Pike for that matter. There's tons of both up here but few people target them."
59447,Joey,2007-04-13 03:01:00,9122,"Ya, same wherever we fish too Dan.  And people aren't keeping them like they used to.  Joey"
59448,Heybud_e,2007-04-13 03:04:00,208,"i have found in the past cpl years that they have been a little wormier than usual, so i would asume that could be part of the reason..  (my opinon) "
59449,Bernie,2007-04-13 03:13:00,3190,Happens in Nipissing Joey. Most target Pickerel and keep them. Bass are usually tossed back in..Its got to upset the balance. Tons of smallies in Nip.
59450,Dutch,2007-04-13 03:13:00,831," Excellent segue there Joey.  Bass population in the Kawarthas is growing too.  By the way, I drink my coffee black, those who drink it with milk or cream may as well be poachers......and I like console vs. tiller, so sue me."
59451,bigfish1965,2007-04-13 03:14:00,3382,No difference. Both are illegal to possess.
59374,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-13 00:34:00,0,"Here is the information bellow. It's not because the MNR won't enforce a law that it makes it legal.  Angling Close Times  25. No person shall engage in angling for or catch by angling and retain a fish of a species set out in Column I of an item of Part I of Schedule III from the waters set out in Column II of a subitem of that item during the close time set out in Column V of that subitem.  It reads a bit complicated but the first half of the statement says it all.  To summarize; it is unlawful to target closed season fish and if a fish is caught in closed season it must be released immediately (forthwith) into the waters in which it is caught. Taking pictures, or any other activity which interferes with the return of the fish to the water, would not meet the threshold of “forthwith”. The real driver here is the term in section 13 “release it in a manner that causes least harm to the fish”, the objective is to get the fish back into the water with the best possible chance of recovery.  I hope this helps in your discussions,  xxx xxxxxx  Provincial Enforcement Specialist  Enforcement Branch  300 Water Street, Peterborough  Ontario. K9J 8M5  Telephone: 705-755-xxxx  Facsimile: 705-755-xxxx  E-mail: [email protected]  13. Subject to subsection 35(1), every person who catches a fish of a species  (a) at a time or place at which fishing for that species is prohibited, ( by amethod or with fishing gear the use of whidch is prohibited in respect of that species, or © the possession or retention of which is prohibited  shall return the fish forthwith to the waters in which it was caught and, where the fish is alive, release it in a manner that causes least harm to the fish."
59387,GbayGiant,2007-04-13 01:00:00,1780,"I think it's another GREY area, some MNR say it's o.k. some say it's not, just another confusing rule in the book.  Because if someones taking a picture while the person who caught the fish is removing hooks etc... than your still releasing it forthwith. If your fishing by yourself setting the cameras timer to get a shot, it would take extra time."
59396,danc,2007-04-13 01:13:00,4677,"Personally speaking, I wouldn't want a picture of an OOSF caught by me. It was (most likely) caught accidentally and really means nothing. There is a reason that they are OOS. Usually because they are big fish and they spawning and congregated to very specific areas and they are very vulnerable. In other words, easy to catch. Keep the cameras in the tackle box and let them go asap."
59398,bigfish1965,2007-04-13 01:18:00,3382,"Why do we have to go through this? It is illegal to POSSESS fish that are OOS. Possession is placing a fish or retaining a fish so that it is reasonable to assume an immediate release is not intended. If it were illegal to take a picture of an OOS, it would also be illegal to take pictures of fish that are NOT IN THE SLOT! How many pictures have you taken of musky that were not legal for possession???? There has not been a single charge laid for someone snapping a quick picture of a fish that was OOS where the fish was released right after. Also remember there are many places in Ontario where bass and walleye are open all year. There are open all year right here in my area. Next year they won't be."
