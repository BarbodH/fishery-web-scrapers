59318,aplumma,2007-04-12 22:06:00,6896,After a recent good faith measure from the Canadian Representative (Northern Cajun Chapter 101) who has stopped sending cold weather down South. The Southern Contingency has decided to allow a limited amount of warm weather up North on a trial bases. We would all like to thank CrappieSteve for the good faith that was shown and the offer of one cigar and one beer to Aplumma to end this stalemate.   Art

59539,aplumma,2007-04-13 13:57:00,6896,"It appears I spoke to soon the information that the Crazy Canadian Cajun gave me must be bad. Maybe I can pay someone .75 cents to give him a nasty hangnail or such. I have pleaded with the local officials and so far they have responded with "" What the he** are you talking about"". Talks will be resume next week after CrappieSteve stops telling me stories.   Art"
