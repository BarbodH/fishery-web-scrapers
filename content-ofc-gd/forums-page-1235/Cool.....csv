Kinda weird, Kinda Cool, sorta disturbing.. so much history.... and you wear it on your wrist..   http://www.romainjerome.ch/rj/baselworld2007/index.htm   I dont think I can afford one of these badboys however, The price on these suckers range from $7,800 to $173,100, and 2,012 watches are planned for production.   Gerritt."

59941,Heybud_e,2007-04-14 18:13:00,208,"yea, that would bug me i think... but im cool with the Swiss Army watch i already got..."
