59386,Hookset,2007-04-13 00:57:00,367,Just wondering. Do you use a different knot on the terminal end when fishing fluoro over say 50 lbs than you would tie for mono or fluoro under 50 ? I'm wondering if the added thickness of a high pound line requires a specific knot than say a palomar or clinch knot like I would use bass fishing. I don't mean a knot to tie 2 different lines together but specifically a terminal end knot. I'm gonna make switch to fluoro leaders from steel leaders because of the reduced visibility but I like to have confidence in my knots. Imagine that lol.  Thanks for any help.
59392,mdej,2007-04-13 01:09:00,98,I think that most guys that hit that size of floro for leaders use crimp tubes.  That is what I will be doing when I make larger # floro leaders.  I know I have tied up to 35# using a uni knot and no issues to date (little superglue to hold it tight).  This is what I'm talking about http://cgi.ebay.com/LEADER-SLEEVES-RIGGING...bayphotohosting  Berkley and others make these kits that include crimping plyers as well.

59645,Hookset,2007-04-13 20:29:00,367,Thanks mdej and Raf. Since I have never used a crimp tube I will probably go with the uni-knot since it was recommended by both of you. It's a pretty simple knot and I know how to tie that one. The perfection knot seems a little complicated. I found an example of the perfection knot here   http://www.animatedknots.com/indexfishing.php  Hookset.
