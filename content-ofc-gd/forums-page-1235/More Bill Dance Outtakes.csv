59246,Joey,2007-04-12 20:15:00,9122,"Hahahahaha, those are great.  Thanks  Joey"
59247,tbayboy,2007-04-12 20:15:00,1497,"Thanks for the laughs TJ, I'm sure no one here has ever experienced anything like that ... by the way if anyone finds an anchor without any rope attached at the bottom of Lac des Milles lac (near pine point) it definitely was NOT me tossing something that wasn't tied first"
59248,snag,2007-04-12 20:17:00,1932,I know more about him from his bloopers than his actual show!   P.s. Love Roy
59262,Guest lundboy,2007-04-12 20:40:00,0,"He's a hoot....  BP has the whole DVD Volume 3 (Yes there is a V1 & V2, only available from his site)  To bad WFN doesn't carry his show (or In-Fisherman, Angling Edge, Hank Parker etc.)  Any of these would make a good replacement for the English carp fishing from the bank tournaments!"
59274,Golfisher,2007-04-12 21:08:00,586,"Oh, man, that is priceless!"
59306,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-12 21:41:00,4399,Dance is priceless is he really that clumsy/stupid some of those looked staged especially the boat ones.
59317,tjsa,2007-04-12 22:05:00,1578," Yeah, I sometimes wonder about that myself, especially when he knocked the camerman off his boat, with a very expensive camera probably worth in the range of $10,000.00 bucks back then, not including the lens which would have been another $5,000.00 bucks."
59352,Jen,2007-04-12 22:59:00,833,Still laughing as I type this!
59376,Rizzo,2007-04-13 00:41:00,4754,Man that guy is a nob.  Can't stand the way he drags fish back and forth trying to make it look like they are fighting hard.  He practically drowns his catch pulling it all over the place
59457,Nanook,2007-04-13 03:44:00,565," Thanks for posting that Tom,Bills bloopers are always good for a laugh.Always enjoyed his fishing shows as well."
59461,majorlifts,2007-04-13 03:57:00,171,"Is that Frank Rizzo or Paul Rizzo?  Whats up there jerky, I guess you never watched the old Canadian sport fishing show eh tough guy. Trowin fish around like freekin jag asses if ya know what I mean.  Funny stuff, eh. Well I like the dancin man myself, only I heard his old lady catches more fish then Darryl Cronzie. hahaaa"
