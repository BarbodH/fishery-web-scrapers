59147,BITEME,2007-04-12 16:12:00,1969,    DOES IT REALLY MATTER?????
59150,ecxstriper,2007-04-12 16:15:00,343,there are several tables out there with that information . You also need to include girth of the fish to get an accurate estimation of weight. Each species puts weigh t on differently depending on basic body shape as the two you mentioned.

I have measured and weighted fish and compared to the calculators a couple times before, they are usually very close, withing 10% over or under so it gives you a good idea."
