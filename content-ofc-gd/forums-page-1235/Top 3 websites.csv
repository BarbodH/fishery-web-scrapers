59714,Daplumma,2007-04-13 23:28:00,1961,Just wondering what your top 3 sites are after OFC? Here are mine: http://haha.nu/index.php http://www.capitalweather.com/index.php http://www.johnnybenson.com/index.shtml There are ton of other sites I visit daily but these are a must check every day.What are yours? Joe
59717,GbayGiant,2007-04-13 23:41:00,1780,"OFC is my fave by far.  I always check ""Yahoo canada"" for the local news and ""CNN"" news in the morning. Then I check the Weather from ""the weather network"" than I'm addicted to ""Ebay"" so I look on there all the time and check ""NBA.com"" to see how Steve Nash is doing.  Man' I'm turning into more of a geek everyday, damn Bill Gates.  All fishing in 2 weeks no more internet for this guy., exept for OFC daily check in."

59733,Daplumma,2007-04-14 00:17:00,1961,"That sorta crossed my mind Bill but most guys here ""get it"" and I wouldn't expect too much shameless plugging of other fishing type websites.I just want to see what other good websites that people here visit. Joe"

59776,OhioFisherman,2007-04-14 01:42:00,6623,"This is the only fishing site I hit regularly anymore, just the best I have seen, and more or less what my interests in fishing are centered on. I hit other sites on  occasion, depending on what I need to get info on, and due to my illness I hit MsWorld and BrainTalk to get info on medical issues.  LOL I was always a bit of a book worm, now I read info on stuff on the net."
