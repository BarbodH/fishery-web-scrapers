614637,Hooked,2011-08-23 03:55:00,891,Was wondering if you like to spray scent on your plastics?  If so.....what do you like for Walleye\Pickeral and Bass?
614777,GBW,2011-08-23 16:44:00,8460,yes I do.  YUM garlic and crawfish are good for a spray but I'm going to get some trigger-x stuff to try too.  I also like the Megastrike paste as it stays on the bait longer.  just don't mix the tube up with your toothpaste!
614781,mercman,2011-08-23 16:50:00,7054,"I've used the triggerX stuff too.Not sure if it helped catch the fish, or if it was just a confidence booster. What ever you do, dont spray it into the wind. The stuff smells like.......well...you know"
614790,fishnsled,2011-08-23 17:19:00,3520,Been using Bang for a few years now and happy with it. A lot of times I do just go natural as there is so much salt and other scents in the plastics now.

614942,Dave Bailey,2011-08-24 01:08:00,1641,"Took over a bunch of bags of plastic a while back from a friend, he decided he wasn't in to fishing any more. All of them were doused with anisette, and I was thinking 'what a waste of good liqueur!' I've also heard that vanilla extract is a good one. But a lot of the stuff nowadays is already impregnated so I don't want to mess up whatever is already in there."
