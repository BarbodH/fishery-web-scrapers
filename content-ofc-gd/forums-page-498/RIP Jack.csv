614542,basketclam,2011-08-22 22:07:00,115,"I can't say anything more than what's already been said.  And thanks OFC'rs for talking frankly about the man, while setting politics aside.  Kudos."
614555,express168,2011-08-22 22:46:00,327,"I did not agree with the NDP views but you can never dispute the character and charisma that Jack had. If he was the leader of the Liberals or PC's he definately would have been Prime Minister in my opinion.  Rest in Peace Jack , I could only hope to have half of the confidence and motivation you had sir."
614561,craigdritchie,2011-08-22 22:55:00,1586,"Never gave the man my vote, but always respected him as a strong leader and as a true patriot who devoted his life to public service.  I feel for his family. But the truth is, we all lost something today.  Rest in peace, Jack. We need more like you."
614652,Fishnwire,2011-08-23 10:14:00,983,"What a loss.  It's hard to imagine about what he might have accomplished for this country had his time not been cut short.  I feel sort of like we all got ""ripped off"".  Talk about big shoes to fill."
614747,pikehunter,2011-08-23 15:24:00,1659," Very large shoes for sure.  When I listened to his resignation live on the radio I could not get over how much his health had changed and how quickly. I think all of us knew that what was next feeling his pain and suffering as he spoke. Damn good leader and a fine person, I wish for his ideals to proliferate.  He is a character that will go on to live forever in Canadian history."
614756,Gregoire,2011-08-23 15:36:00,1397,I'm glad Harper did the right thing and offered a state funeral. One of the few things I agree with him on...besides some of his fiscal policies.
614784,Toronto_Angler,2011-08-23 17:05:00,698,"Don't understand why most condolences need to start with ""While I didn't agree with his views"". Who cares? A man who served the public and did what he thought was best passed away. Has nothing to do with whether you agree with his views or not."
614944,blarg,2011-08-24 01:38:00,289,"  I suppose it's because even though some of us didn't like him we still respect him for his work and tenacity, I don't understand why some people need to turn condolences in something negative.  RIP Jack."
614287,NAW,2011-08-22 12:56:00,4022,Just herd he passed away.  Sad news.  http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110822/ndp-leader-jacklayton-obit/20110822/?hub=CalgaryHome
614289,Pikeslayer,2011-08-22 12:57:00,1443,He was a good man and a fine Canadian.
614294,bigbuck,2011-08-22 13:04:00,2449,"Although I did not agree with his politics, I respected him as a politician. My condolences go out to his family."
614295,bucktail,2011-08-22 13:07:00,1857,"Wow that was fast, but I guess thats best. Horrible disease that no one should get.  RIP"
614305,Joey,2011-08-22 13:25:00,9122,"Just terribly sad news.  Live life people, you never know when it's going to end.  RIP Jack!"
614306,motion,2011-08-22 13:33:00,403,"Very sad indeed. Though I didn't believe in his party, he was in my opinion a very good leader with a great work ethic. He will most certainly be missed by all Canadians."
614309,fishnsled,2011-08-22 13:41:00,3520,A sad day for Canadian politics. Not that I was a fan of the NDP but I certainly can respect and appreciate what he did for the party.   Rest in peace Jack.
614327,irishfield,2011-08-22 14:05:00,26272,"A rare breed, actually putting politics before his own personal interest. Unfortunate that such a decission is what probably cost him his life. Godspeed Jack... I did enjoy our chat !"
614344,mercman,2011-08-22 14:31:00,7054,This news almost brought me to tears.  RIP Jack.You will live on in the hearts and minds of Canadians forever.  
614348,limeyangler,2011-08-22 14:36:00,5204,RIP Jack...i did agree with a lot of what you said!
614359,Pigeontroller,2011-08-22 14:50:00,2793,"He obviously was very sick when he stepped down a little less than a month ago...That shows he had incredible strength of spirit and character. Political views aside, we have lost a GREAT Canadian LEADER.  Rest Easy Jack."
614364,nexstar,2011-08-22 14:56:00,63,"RIP Layton. Although our political views might be different, you really did work hard for the NDP and you deserve a better life.You will not be forgotten. RIP"
614365,Grimace,2011-08-22 14:59:00,2020,"I liked Jack.  I always chuckle when I think of the debate on tv the first time around for Harper when Jack said ""Nice sweater Stephen, now where is your platform"".  ""Now you say you have a plan?  Where is it? Where is your platform? Is it under the sweater?"".  He was making fun of Harper's ads with him wearing that stupid blue sweater.  Man did I laugh. Jack was an excellent debater and I found him very entertaining as well."
614370,bushart,2011-08-22 15:14:00,2628,Very Sad News
614383,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-22 15:30:00,4399,Condolences to the Layton family.  God speed Jack Layton
614403,Gregoire,2011-08-22 16:14:00,1397,"It is so sad that he will not live to see the success that he worked so hard to achieve for his party. I think what he did in quebec last election was great for canada, and may bring us together as a country. I hope that momentum can continue without his leadership."
614408,rob v,2011-08-22 16:25:00,535,He gave his life for this country and his politics.  A fine Canadian.
614424,ehg,2011-08-22 17:01:00,2666,A very sad passing indeed. Because of his leadership separatism is now off the Canadian political agenda. Truly wanted to make a better place for working class (majority of) Canadians.
614471,kickingfrog,2011-08-22 18:44:00,8333,"Jack's letter for Canada, writen Saturday August 22, 2011.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/08/22/pol-layton-last-letter.html"
614476,NAW,2011-08-22 18:58:00,4022," He was a leader right to the end.  On his death bed, he spend some of his final moments putting this letter together.  Incredibly dedicated."
614485,tb4me,2011-08-22 19:09:00,3295,"''My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we'll change the world''  -Jack Layton . 1955-2011.  Awesome! These words from a man on his way out of this world..."
614493,Jds63,2011-08-22 19:21:00,1365,His letter was inspiring to all Canadians. The NDP have lost a great leader.
614508,esoxansteel,2011-08-22 20:07:00,1307,"  A quote by a truly great individual, I did not vote for the party, but I respected Jack more then any other of the political leaders, I would not want to be in charge of filling those shoes, a down to earth man, who would standup for what he believed in, and not back down, a sad day for all Canadians, regardless of political preference. To be able to write a final letter to all Canadians, knowing that he will be leaving us, we all owe Jack his final wish to make Canada a better place, and to continue the legacy he has started."
614511,adolson,2011-08-22 20:17:00,783,Sad day... RIP
