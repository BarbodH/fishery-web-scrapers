615095,fishing n autograph,2011-08-24 15:45:00,2540,"Environment Canada has issued severe storm warnings and tornado warnings from Windsor to Barrie and up through the Nickle belt. Be careful everyone, lets hope what happened in Goderich doesn't repeat itself!  This release covers Waterloo Region and the GTA but on the weathernetwork channel it's saying pretty much all of southern Ontario West of the GTA and north of it.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/alerts/wwcaon0063c/caon0356/weather?ref=warnings_citypage"
