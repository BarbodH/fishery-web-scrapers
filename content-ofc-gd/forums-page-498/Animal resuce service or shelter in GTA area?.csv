615331,okumasheffield,2011-08-25 02:46:00,318,found this kitten around my place today. pretty sure it is not a household cat and wonder if there are organizations I can take her in for others to adoptions
615335,HTHM,2011-08-25 03:09:00,4082,Do you musky fish???? TSPCA should take it.
615341,okumasheffield,2011-08-25 03:41:00,318,do I just bring her to TSPCA?
615342,Joey,2011-08-25 04:02:00,9122,"yes, but don't give them any of your information unless you are willing to pay for any medication the kitten may need.  A friend and I took a stray kitten to the shelter once and they were going to bill us for anything it needed even after we told them we only found it, it was not ours."
615442,okumasheffield,2011-08-25 15:37:00,318, What are they going to do with her if no one pays for things she needs?
615445,Terry,2011-08-25 15:40:00,14456,sleep.....  some put down unwanted animals and others have policies not too
615454,HTHM,2011-08-25 16:01:00,4082,"Regardless of when you read this, at this moment there are more unwanted kittens and puppies being born."
