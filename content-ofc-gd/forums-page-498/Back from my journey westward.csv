615131,GreenCanada,2011-08-24 17:03:00,375,"Greetings!  So I have returned from visiting my brother and his girlfriend who live in Calgary. For the week and a half I was out West we travelled most of the time through logging roads in the Okanagan Valley, while also hitting up some out of the way lakes and river locations. Not to mention landing some hammer trouts in the Bow River.  Some of the water we fished (not a complete list)   :  Mabel Lake Garnett Lake Upper Kananaskis lake Lower Kananaskis lake East Kootenay River Thompson River Columbia River South Thompson River  Anyways, it was amazing getting back to my home province (BC) and being able to spend some quality time with the people I care about. Hopefully you enjoy the pictures.  I landed 5 new (to me) species of fish. Westslope Cutthroat Trout, Bull Trout, Northern Pike Minnow (Northern Pike Minnow) aka Squaw Fish, Rocky Mountain Whitefish, and possibly a Dolly Varden. In addition, I caught my personal best Brown Trout the first day, and then crushed that personal best with a beautiful 23"" brown my last day.  Pictures to come..."
