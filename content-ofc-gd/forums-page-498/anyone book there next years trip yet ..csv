Not really a question here but wondering if anyone or most have booked next years annual fishing trip yet.. Like to hear where also to give other guys good ideas and myself for future ventures.. Myself i might only get out once more this year ,and maybe once more lake erie or lake ontario,one is going to be a camping weekend close by ,, just to get away.."

615296,kuhaman,2011-08-25 01:06:00,503,I haven't even finished booking this years trips yet!
615324,TennesseeGuy,2011-08-25 02:06:00,957,"Have hit the same water for 27 consecutive walleye openers.  We don't discuss it anymore.  Just do it.  Only change is that I often stay two weeks and sometimes three weeks.  It's hard to do the job right in only one week.  My outfitter and I have not discussed the date, but he knows I'll have a full cabin for the May 19 week.  New moon May 20, 2012.  Should be a great May 19 walleye opener."

615359,Rich Clemens,2011-08-25 11:56:00,3131,"Already booked for the third week-end in June (and the following week) for our Lakair GTG.   Took Cabin 9 for next year to get something on water-front.  By the time I return from the French next month, I'll have those two weeks booked again for next year."
615363,lew,2011-08-25 12:08:00,12766,"Two weeks in August on the West Arm of Nippissing, as has become the norm the last few years, and I can't think of another place I'd rather be."
