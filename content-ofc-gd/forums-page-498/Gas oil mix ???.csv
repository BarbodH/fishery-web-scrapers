It gives you the choice of different ratio and you just find the amou nt of gas you are using and you fill up the small bottle up to the corresponding mark. It is so handy to have and they are only $8.00.  I always mix only a day's worth of gas for my 9.9 which I very rarely use.
613754,cranks bait,2011-08-20 00:24:00,721,"I got one of those bottles a few years ago when they were $3.00.  Really good investment.  Trying to figure out the chainsaw 40:1, boat 50:1, another motor 100:1, weedeater 30:1, the list goes on.  I used to screw up the math, no I don't worry about it, get the bottle!!!!"
613771,docknocker,2011-08-20 01:20:00,36,  Get a measuring Cup Pour in 50oz Gas Then pour in 1 oz oil  Or 25oz gas 1oz oil then 25 oz gas This helps mix iit up a bit Put it all in a 1 gal. gas can Give it a good shake And you are done! Regards SteveO

613798,Sinker,2011-08-20 03:49:00,8692,50:1 mix is 20ml of oil per liter of fuel. Easy sleasy.  S.
613799,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-20 03:53:00,10439,  Just use Opti-2 or Amsoil and use 100:1 for everything.

614846,zum,2011-08-23 19:33:00,6,"Just times by 20,when using liters."
614885,skeeter,2011-08-23 22:20:00,1907,"easiest way to do oil mixture.  multiply the liters by 1000, then divide that by your mixture.  EG: 4.7L x 1000 = 4700, then divide by what ever your mixture is. 4700 divided by 50= 94 ml 32 to 1 would be 146.9 ml"
615040,Billy Bob,2011-08-24 14:12:00,5865,The second most important thing after the correct mixture is keep everything as CLEAN as possible....before and after you mix your gas/oil.
