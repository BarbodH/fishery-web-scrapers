Have the salmon started to move up the Niagara and 2. Has anybody open the Birch Island lodge on the Georian Bay? Spent a week there a few years ago.  Did not catch a lot of fish, but it was nice to sit back and Thank God for such a beautiful place.  Enjoy each day and every day that God gives us. Bob"

Apparently it was a business venture that they tried and did not really enjoy.  Too bad, there was a great bass hole I found there 3 years ago that never failed!  If it's that neck of the woods your are looking for, there are several places close by that would offer the same scenery.  Brennan Harbour Resort comes to mind and there is another one just outside of spanish, on the river, that is supposed to be pretty good.  Sorry I do not remember the name though.  Good luck!"
