612878,Terry,2011-08-17 09:02:00,14456,"if you limit access, so that only people ho can afford to pay lots of my for a fly-in that is not conservation it is elitism   Oh Canada Land for the rich"
612888,Grimace,2011-08-17 10:24:00,2020,"It is not a form of conservation if it is auctioned off, that would called a sale.  The north's lakes are for sale, and once sold you will not be able to fish them anymore unless you pay some private lodge owner a hunk of money.  Closing roads that already go to a lake do not make it remote either, that makes it restricted."
612889,outllaw,2011-08-17 10:38:00,1232,"Sadly, a bad deal for ontarians. Lodge owners and outfitters are creating a vacuum for folks that enjoy the wild north.t his policy has a bad smell. goverments allowed foresty cutting that opened areas up. outfitters should be screaming at that issue, not sportsmen. the mnr has been dictated to from select politics. closures remind me of the european process. closed lands and pay as you go. this offers the demise of crown land usage for canadians., another look his how the u.s. goverment has the bureau of land managment . blm lands are another sad affair.  land owners charge a fee to acsess these lands. obviosly the ontario goverment is once again whoring our resources. will these areas still be fish stocked for the select groups?. foresight is NOT a strong point in our goverments ."

612603,chessy,2011-08-16 14:45:00,610,I came across this while surfing i can not for the life of me see how they (mnr ) can seal up the land for outfitters  and i can not see how the OFAH can agree to a 2km radious they are fighing for it but they should be fighing for a complete area accessed by all  http://www.ofah.org/downloads/pdf/news/2011/PreliminaryOFAHResponse_CLUAH_Stage_III.pdf
612611,Dara,2011-08-16 15:24:00,3052,  I think lake simcoe should be designated as no access except for walking within 2 km...maybe Rice as well...lets get the remote factor back to southern Ontario where they come up with this crap
612613,12footspringbok,2011-08-16 15:28:00,459,  Don't give them any ideas. Seriously

612616,Dara,2011-08-16 15:32:00,3052,  You know ther'e gonna lock this on us eh
612617,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-16 15:34:00,0,"i don't think they'll lock it up.  as more and more people have negative experiences regarding the way our crown land is being managed, the more likely we will see changes in the future.  it's about time that OFAH did SOMETHING about this even if it's a small contribution."
612620,chessy,2011-08-16 15:40:00,610, but the OFAH is in favor of a 2km ban from the way i read it ....they should be in favor of it being wide open..... i know i can not be pro ofah only when i want to ... that is why the ofah should not speak for us.... i am sending in my own ebr comment that it should remain open to all people .... its our tax dollars that are paying for this.....   
612621,Terry,2011-08-16 15:40:00,14456," with the towns closing/selling ramps and access spots, no parking signs and no parking with trailers signs, they have almost done it anyways"

612623,Dara,2011-08-16 15:45:00,3052,  Just think of the money land owners will be able to make....just like the outfitters...more taxes to be paid
612628,12footspringbok,2011-08-16 15:55:00,459," Thats one angle but i feel there are many more. One of the most frightening being UN's agenda 21 and returning certain parts of North America back to the wild and creating areas that are off limits to humans, but I won't go any further on that topic here on OFC."

If I understand the OFAH position, it looks like they want to increase access to all these remote lakes.   To me that just seems counter to their supposed stance on conservation.  I'll have to spend some time wading my way through that web of government documents to better educate myself on this proposal.  I believe September 1st 2011 is that last day for public comment.  Thanks for posting that link."
612835,irishfield,2011-08-17 02:19:00,26272,"It's like Lady Evelyn/Smoothwater. 3 years ago they made it so canoers can pay to have them and their canoe flown in, but I can't fly my own wife in and drop her and her canoe off. Get my markings and I'll see you in tribunal !    We were shown one draft that was acceptable to the flying community and then they passed a different document thru the gazette !"
612840,Dara,2011-08-17 02:30:00,3052,  It has nothing to do with conservation and protection. If it was then they would outlaw aircraft access as well. it is totally to protect the flyin camps.  People in the north have limited recreation available. Therefore they fish and enjoy the outdoors. They are having their recreation land taken away from them so tourist operators can make a buck.  Like I saidrestrict access to simcoe and rice before you before you limit northerners access  Educate yourself on life in the north before you make laws to control it
612841,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-17 02:31:00,0, This is nothing to do with conservation.  Conservation would be limiting access to all to preserve the fishery.  This is just a case of auctioning off our resources to the highest bidder.  A truly remote lake doesn't have parties of anglers staying on it every week.
612865,adempsey,2011-08-17 03:20:00,1498,The way I see it is that limiting access to a fishery is indeed a form of conservation.  I think there is plenty of evidence to support the impact on the fishery when access is less restrictive.    Why does it have to be black and white - no access or complete access?  Why no middle ground?  That is where everyone benefits in the long run.
