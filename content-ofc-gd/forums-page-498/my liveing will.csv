If that ever happens, just pull the plug.'  They got up, unplugged the Computer, and threw out my glass of scotch."

614551,irishfield,2011-08-22 22:33:00,26272,"Ahhh... you just caught me on a good day Bruce!!  Amazing what some rude awakenings can do to a guys ""ways"" in life. It was 2 years ago today that my Mother passed... 2 years + 7 weeks since my sister.  Jen is doing great... ""cancer free"".. and also short a right pelvic bone but she's making do. Getting around pretty good on crutches and still isn't allowed to put weight on that right leg that has no mechanical attachment to her torso. She's having some severe foot pain/burning issues though from nerve damage that are the biggest concern right now.  As for a G2G.. how well can you travel?? I'm sure one of the resident ""clowns"" from the TO area could pick you up and I'm sure we could put a Muskie hunt together on GBay for you and a couple boat mates.  Wayne"
614553,misfish,2011-08-22 22:42:00,29133,"Bruce  Not sure what to say.  You knew my uncle,(shame how his life turned out,ended) You gave my grandfather a few great times on your charters,(those days I will never forget) Brused thumb from reeling in that big Coho.  Those times, are still embeded in my mind.   I pray your health gets better.May the angels be by you. To many good people leave this earth to soon.

614571,Joey,2011-08-22 23:08:00,9122,"Bruce, I heard a little bit about the battle you are dealing with and wish you all the best buddy!  I hope all turns out well and you make a full recovery.  The names you mentioned above are the most stand up guys I know and would be there for anyone in a heartbeat.  Great to have them on your side and rootin for you ain't it  Take care Bruce and don't hesitate to ask for any help from any of us, anytime!!!     On another note, Wayne, I went through the nerve damage, peripheral neuropathy to be exact (still am), and if Jen needs any tips, have her give me a call or email me.  Can't make it go away, but can try my best to help lessen the pain and tips on shoes to wear etc.  Joey"

Sorry to hear of this set back and I do hope that you have a quick and full recovery. Yeah, I'll bring a guitar (bass) and we can have a jam session! Get well soon... HH"
