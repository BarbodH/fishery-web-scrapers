614340,Gregoire,2011-08-22 14:24:00,1397,"Nice day on the water. We got caught out in the lake in that storm...luckily we were in a pretty big boat, and we avoided the worst of it. I get drenched pulling the lines, but after the storm cleared the weather improved. I would not imaging what a smaller boat without protection from the elements would have experienced. Apparently the storm was really bad in the city, and we were pretty lucky. The funniest part was the wives phoning or texting every minute for an update. Kinda hard to take a call in that crap."
614342,ccmtcanada,2011-08-22 14:29:00,7971,YIKES!! Those storm clouds and waves would have scared the crap out of me!!  Great report and pics.  Gotta love it when members here get together!
614352,Jigs,2011-08-22 14:42:00,136,Nice fish!  Sounds like you guys had a blast. Looks like you'll have some nice table-fare there too.  Those clouds would be enough to scare anybody off the water. Especially one of the great Lakes. I guess there was some nasty weather up that way this weekend.   
614360,mercman,2011-08-22 14:51:00,7054,Nice going Mike Looks like Simon was on the mark that day.Great days fishung with friends are truly priceless. I look forward to fishing with the both of you this fall.Both of you are Class Acts all the way  Paul  
614506,mercman,2011-08-22 20:04:00,7054,"I would make them wash and wax your musky rod and reel.   Oops sorry....wrong thread, i thought it was for ideas on a friendly wager.  Silly me  "
614513,danbouck,2011-08-22 20:22:00,4380,Nice Report! 4 more days of work until it's my turn
614517,Joey,2011-08-22 20:55:00,9122,"Great report, glad you had a good time and caught some fish in this 1/2 of the trade.  That storm looks nasty.  Would not have wanted to be on the water with that happening.  I've been on the 401 when a truck tire blew right beside me, now that was scary     I can agree with you on that one that's for sure!!!"
614531,Billy Bob,2011-08-22 21:34:00,5865,Nice report Mike.....and Simon came through with a great day on Ontario...  GREAT fish for the smoker...
614705,Pikeslayer,2011-08-23 13:11:00,1443,"Hey Mike, Sean & I truly enjoyed your company and it was our pleasure to have you as a guest. Well, when a new friend shows up at one's home with a few pounds of freshly frozen walleye   and a couple of bottles of Cattle Boyz (Thanks Mercman)   , what is one supposed to do? Here's a cold Heinekin, sit down and relax and I'll prepare a gourmet dinner for you. BTW Mike, those shrimp were prepared from a prized recipe of which I know only 3 members on this board are in possession of  (Thanks ______).  In retrospect, that was our best day on the water in a couple of weeks (LO has been a little challenging this year) and it's always fun to have an LO 'rookie' on board. We always get to see something interesting on first time hook ups. For the rookies out there; the biggest learning curve is avoiding the natural tendancy to set the hook, you don't have to. Example, see the chinook in the fish box (last picture) with the broken neck  .  And to top the day, the 'adventure' on LO was quite the 'event'. As Mike mentioned, it was great day weather wise. Flat water all day, a bit of cloud a bit of sun and a brief shower in the bluezone. We were 10 nm (18 km) off shore when we called rods up @ 2:30. Shoreline was clearly visible and no cause for concern. About half way in, the horizon was rapidly turning grey and rain gear was donned. 2.5 to go and the winds came up (30 knots according to sailflow when I checked @ home) day turned to night, and the temp dropped 10* C. Life jackets donned, air horn in Sean's hand and safety box at the ready. 1 nm to go and the rain came in sheets and visibility was maybe 100 m. Bilge activated, nav lights on. Sean's eyes were 6 - 10 o'clock, Mike had 2-6. The last 20 minutes into port was somewhat tense. I was confident in our vessel and crew (all experienced boaters) but concerned about the other boats heading to port (like the one 'tard comin in hot @ 2:00 without lights). We had to rely on the GPS to get us back to port and it was a relief to see the channel into Promenade. Just as we pulled into port, the rains subsided and we found: the double ramp occupied with a charter unloading clients and fish (that was okay) and an unoccupied boat tied off to the other side (this was definitely not okay). We're soaked to the bone, temp was 14* C and ten minutes later, a couple of   come strolling throught the parking lot (from their nice dry car?) and casually launch their boat. Words weren't necessary. Three sets of eyes glaring pretty much said everything. We were finally off the water and heading home @ 3:30. By 4:15 we were dry and hydrated (well Mike wasn't hydrated as he had a 5 hour drive home). Goodbyes @ 4:30 and nappy time by 5:00 .  Mike, we had a great time wrapped into 24 hrs and Sean and I are happy to call you our friend. Looking forward to the Musky hunt in the near future with you and Paul.  Regards, Simon  p.s. Saturday's trip with Vinnimon & HTHM turned out be another 'priceless' day. But we're not talking about that  ."
614755,Billy Bob,2011-08-23 15:36:00,5865,WOW.........one of the best muskie guys and one of the best salmon guys get together and produce on the big lake....tougher then most think....LOTS and LOTS and LOTS of water out there for fish to hide...  GREAT JOB BOYS....   Bob
614900,skeeter,2011-08-23 22:54:00,1907,Yet ANOTHER great report coming from a day fishing with Simon. I wouldnt want to be the person who got to do the laundry that day.
614928,HTHM,2011-08-24 00:21:00,4082,"Not a word will be said, heck they can't be repeated anyway.....  However it was a fun outing for me to see two experienced fishermen at work."
614977,Lokka,2011-08-24 05:57:00,32,Hoping to get out with my dad on Friday weather permitting.. have had no luck in the past couple of weeks.. but i'm glad you guys are out having fun. The one fish in the cooler looks like it had it's head ripped off.. ouch.
614997,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 12:27:00,4661,  Mnr testing...
615002,Aaron Shirley,2011-08-24 12:49:00,655,Nice day on Lady O.  It's great to have the BZ fishery when the inshore bite is slow. That one bow is big
