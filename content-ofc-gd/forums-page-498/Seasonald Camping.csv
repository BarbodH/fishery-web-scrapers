We're looking for a seasonal site for our trailer on simcoe, scugog, kawarthas area. We live in Acton and would like to be no further than about 2 hours away. Been calling a lot but most will not accept our trailer as it is a 1990. (most want 20 years or newer. Called just about everything I could find online. If anyone knows about an area please let us know.  Thanks,  Curt"

614203,lplp,2011-08-22 02:16:00,83,"We had that problem before also,, we had an older trailer ,so we ended up buying a newer one to get into a park on scugog,, we are not there now as the price got so ridiculous , i thought the streets were paved in gold but they were not. Goreskis is the only park on scugog, but if you go to the marina on othe side of them ,they have some camp sites ,would be a lot cheaper ,, sturgeon lake would be cheaper also and would have more places and better fishing from what i hear ,but i did good on scugog .. some parks close to scugog but you want to be on water,, do a search for parks and you should be able to find one ,, alot of these parks are being bought by bigger places parkridge also ,so watch out for that as the prices will go up fast,, start with google maps and do the business search for parks along the area that you want and see what comes up, good luck ,and remember you dont own the lot if you are just renting ,, so dont over pay for services that you dont need.."

614709,nancur373,2011-08-23 13:35:00,1211,I saw that. It is a nice park. I've been there once. But I already own a nice trailer even if it is 21 years old it's in mint shape. I'll find something someday.
614710,bigbuck,2011-08-23 13:44:00,2449,"While your trailer may be in mint shape, it's 21 years old and many if not most parks want newer trailers, I know ours wants trailers less than 10 years old."
