610316,Terry,2011-08-08 18:27:00,14456,"I am working on the ZZtop thing, thought I looked like Bin Laden or should I say BinFish'n  it is a little grey/blue walleye ..nice to see small ones along with the bigger ones        <a href=""http://s17.photobucket.com/albums/b71/mrbeeeeMrbeee/?action=view&current=Bin-fishn.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b71/mrbeeeeMrbeee/Bin-fishn.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
610327,fishnsled,2011-08-08 18:52:00,3520, I thought they buried you at sea to swim with the fishes...
610337,misfish,2011-08-08 19:55:00,29133,  LMAO Thas what Betty said. HAHAHAHAHA  Nice report bud.  Thanks for sharing.
610448,ehg,2011-08-09 01:28:00,2666,"Ha Ha Binfish'n is more of a lookalike. That grey/blue walleye sure is small, interesting colouring trait."
611539,fishhunter,2011-08-12 10:38:00,604,Terry nice report and pics. Been awhile since I have been on here.
611663,Terry,2011-08-12 18:24:00,14456,good to see you hanging around the site Lloyd  hope you're not too busy with work and chartering
611670,irishfield,2011-08-12 18:50:00,26272,He only got a morning pass from the wife Terry... you won't hear from him for another few months!

612168,ccmtcanada,2011-08-15 00:23:00,7971,"Just catching up on reports now that I'm back from vacation.  Despite all the fixing you had to do...the raid by the MNR and other things, it looks like you had a great time Terry!  There's almost a smile on your face in some of those pictures!  Great pics and video Terry!  You don't like writing big reports, but you did a great job with this one!"
612294,Terry,2011-08-15 15:14:00,14456,thanks  the fixing and the bust (LOL) was all part of the experience and I wouldn't want to trade any of it
614647,Billy Bob,2011-08-23 09:40:00,5865,GREAT REPORT.......  More picture........MORE PICTURES.....(i have a hard time reading)...  BTW it Bin Dead.....
614730,Moosebunk,2011-08-23 14:55:00,3970,OK!!! So there it is.  Had just left when you posted.  Always like to read and see pics from any Ontario fly-ins.  From the start of your post I thought.... geez!  This is gonna suck for him.  But then ya kinda pulled it together nicely didn't ya...?
614839,Terry,2011-08-23 19:07:00,14456,it was a great trip  I always figure I should say the good and the bad  I would hate to hear someone went to a fly-in after reading my report and found some bad things and I didn't say it like it is...  there was nothing really wrong ..problems happen everywhere and are just part of the experience
614887,irishfield,2011-08-23 22:23:00,26272,"Love your honesty Terry... a few posts this month should have included some ""untold"" short comings of the fly in camp!"
610043,Terry,2011-08-07 23:46:00,14456,"I don't have time or ambition to do a big report so    Got to airport an hour early to be told they were running two hours behind….  So 3 hours and fifteen minutes later we were in the air on an 8 seat otter  Got to the camp, the pilot didn't tell/show us much but it turned out there is a generator , can't believe they did not tell us. And sirius radio too, hello Howard 100.    They said the cabin was good for 6 people..four would be crowded, two were comfortable .  But it had everything we needed..except a metal spatula for the BBQ or cleaning/scraping tools for the BBQ.  It had hot(kinda) and cold running water and shower..shower did not have a shower head. It was in the open so when the wind blew you had to move around to keep the dribble of water hitting you.  The water hose supplying the water had a leak tried duct tape but that didn't work..I had electrical tape and found a hunk of heavy hose so I made a real good repair, then part if the hose going to the lake was collapsing so I shortened it to stop the problem.    We let the fridge/freezer get cold for hours before we put the food in but it never did really work well  And we lost some food and had lumpy milk…most propane fridges I have used, everything in the fidge part would be frozen and you would need to turn them down a bit    The first outboard motor died plugs fouling , the second one left a oil slick on the water, I opened the cowling and the return gas line on the motor had a leak….had to shorten the hose to stop the leak, turned the idle down so we could troll and it worked great all week.  And I would be happy to book with them again  Lots of walleye, seems there were 4 year classes of fish but to very different strains one was an ordinary yellow walleye the other was grey with a blue tint to then on the fins.    We were happy with the number of fish we caught but it was very hard to find them between 11 am and 6pm add the heat of the sun and we spent those hours trying to keep cool or napping or fixing things and catching up with what Stern has been up to.  We threw everything thing we had and everything worked well…my buddy had a few erie dearies that really worked well and at times out did my worm harness, but we used jigs crankbaits plastic worms and real worms stick baits walleye divers and xraps..all seemed up to the task of catching pickerel.  5 to 18ft seem to hold most of the fish and when you got over deep water they seemed to suspend at 18ft..I would see them on the fishfinder and drop a jig…they were always willing to bite when we found them                        The otter flew pretty fast        Saw a moose, by the time I remembered to take o photo he was moving away from us         <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF42121.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF42121.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>                       Beaver landing   <iframe width=""425"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/bNV_3UKFYTY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>      The walk to the outhouse    <iframe width=""425"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/OwsvYyBAxVY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>    The cabin/genie /shower and water pump  <iframe width=""425"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/JpghJ7-vDR4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Inside the cabin  <iframe width=""425"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bkn3kmaYPBg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
610046,danc,2011-08-07 23:51:00,4677,You went on a fly in? Why didn't you tell us you were going?  Sounds like you had a blast Terry. More pics and details please...
610052,Joey,2011-08-08 00:02:00,9122,"Great report Terry.  Aside from the few things that were not the greatest and all the repairs, it seems you had a good time  Some nice sized pickerel.  Bet you had a few good fish fries  Great videos, really gives you the feeling of the place!!  Joey"

610058,solopaddler,2011-08-08 00:23:00,8605,"Looks like a good time was had, thanks for posting the videos!  (Check your pm's)"
610062,irishfield,2011-08-08 00:25:00,26272,Nothing beats the sound of a Beaver idling down after a nice ride...  Why an Otter out and a Beaver back?  Looks like they heard you were coming and just broke everything in advance!  Glad you had a good time.. been a long time comin!
610073,mercman,2011-08-08 00:43:00,7054,Nice trip Terry The beauty of that place makes up for a few rough edges.
610078,Terry,2011-08-08 00:51:00,14456," because they were dropping people off at another lake when the dropped us off, so they needed the room and dropped people off at our camp when they were picking us up so didn't need the big guns....  and yeah I fix quite a few things, but I come to expect it on fly-ins if people don't tell them they are broken then they don't know it's broken....."
610080,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-08 00:52:00,4399,"Looks like a nice spot Terry, the walk to the poop house looks like it would be fun in the dark!  Ya six guys in that cabin looks tight!  My fly-in is about 3-1/2 weeks away and the anticipation is building!"
610082,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-08 00:53:00,2690,"Thanks for the report Terry!  Some decent walleyes mixed in with some adventure.  As long as you had a good time, it's all good."

610148,ctranter,2011-08-08 03:38:00,543,"My kind of report right here, nice fish!"
610164,Big Cliff,2011-08-08 09:47:00,6899,"Beautiful report Terry, sounds like the kind of place you could spend a couple of weeks at and never have enough. You should have handed them a list of all the repairs you made for them, they might give you a discount next time LOL.  Anyway, thanks for sharing!"
610165,bigugli,2011-08-08 10:19:00,6138,"Despite a few bumps along the way, sounds like a good time. Walleye sure look nice."

610246,fishnsled,2011-08-08 15:28:00,3520,Nice report Terry. Some people would just put up with the problems but I like your enthusiasm.  It just makes for a better trip when things are working even if you have to fix them yourself. Also helps to past the slow fishing times of the day. Thanks for the report.
