614847,Rich Clemens,2011-08-23 19:40:00,3131,YEah - We even felt it here in PA and we're about 100 miles east of Pittsburgh.   Sure got the office girls stirred up.   HIghly unusual for us here in the mountains.
614849,wallyboss,2011-08-23 19:51:00,1095,"Felt it here in Ottawa. It was long, at least 35-40 seconds."
614851,beginner,2011-08-23 19:56:00,542,"I felt it here in Richmond Hill, its feels like it vibrate.."
614853,mercman,2011-08-23 19:57:00,7054,5.3 In Colorado also. Relatively shallow to 4.5-6km deep
614858,aplumma,2011-08-23 20:11:00,6896,No damage but I thought a helicopter was right over the house hovering then it dawned on me it was an earthquake.   Art
614863,Garry2Rs,2011-08-23 20:50:00,1425,"If they get a 9.5 in California, I might just wind-up with ocean front property in Arizona!"
614865,blaque,2011-08-23 20:56:00,2419,"Im no scientist. But how does one person feel it and another not. I felt nothing. NOt during this one or last years. (Im in western new york)  Ive got people telling me 10 miles away how they felt it, and now it was felt up into canada? How did it get past me lol. Im between you guys and the epicenter.  Im seriously asking how this happens."
614870,kickingfrog,2011-08-23 21:10:00,8333,"The type and age of the building you're in can make a big difference. The hight of the building and how high you are in the building comes into play. The ""bedrock"" that the building is on also matters."
614871,Billy Bob,2011-08-23 21:10:00,5865, Only stable people feel earthquakes.....   BTW I didn't feel it either....
614873,jedimaster,2011-08-23 21:16:00,3472,"if your on the ground on bedrock or a house with a really good foundation you may not feel it. I am onthe 5th floor of a 20 floor building, and everyone in the building felt it. This is in Toronto. Last year's I was in a mall and I didn't feel it. but others areound the block felt it. It just depends on what your in and where you are."
614979,Jewelbee,2011-08-24 08:41:00,422,"I'm with you on that one Joey...I was wondering too. Glad you guys are safe! BTW..Didn't feel a thing here....but where i work, ya wouldn't know even if the sky was falling  ..LOL"
614991,Familyfisherman,2011-08-24 11:50:00,188,"We were at Wonderland with the kids...in the water area...seemed to cause some waves in the large pool?  Oh...that's the wave pool...  Didn't feel anything, but I'm wondering if they might've on some of the bigger rides?  Glad I wasn't on one."
615022,mattp33,2011-08-24 13:17:00,290,strange...It was at this time the fishing turned on at scugog.  Maybe it gave my lure more action
615044,Carp,2011-08-24 14:26:00,1488,"Felt a bit of shaking/vibration while driving, but didn't hear what happened until about 30 min. later. I thought I had a flat tire."

614803,scottyswing,2011-08-23 17:56:00,37, Earthquake warning? Attention citizens of California?      HA!

614806,NAW,2011-08-23 17:57:00,4022,"Dang..  You beat me to it!!  HAhaha.  Felt it here in Barrie..  Lasted a while too.  A few minutes anyways.  A little more intense then the one last year.  Last year, the quake was followed by the tornado in Midland.  This year, there's a tornado in Goderich then another quake.  Weird.."
614808,fishindude,2011-08-23 17:58:00,220,yes. just felt it here too in vaughan. nothing on the news about it yet?
614811,Joey,2011-08-23 18:05:00,9122,"Yup, just felt it in Richmond Hill.  We ran outside of the office.  Pretty freaky!!"
614813,kickingfrog,2011-08-23 18:09:00,8333,"I didn't feel it here in Barrie, I was on the ground floor though, Stelic, on the fan, mentioned it while it was happening. That's twice he has been on air during a quake."
614815,jedimaster,2011-08-23 18:15:00,3472,"The security for the building just made an announcement. ""There was an earthquake about 20 minutes ago in virginia. Its up to you if you want to evacuate""  umm gee, yah a little late for the optional evacuation. I think I am going to evacuate at 4pm."
614817,solopaddler,2011-08-23 18:17:00,8605,Was enroute to work at about 1:55 and pulled over 'cause my entire car was shaking violently back and forth. Thought I blew a tire.  Freaky for sure.
614820,mercman,2011-08-23 18:28:00,7054,I thought it was just gas. Pardon me.

614823,bdox,2011-08-23 18:31:00,329,"Wierd, nothing here at King&Simcoe, downtown Toronto. Our building is over 100 years old and we thought it was coming down when the little quake hit last year."
614825,Lunkerhunter,2011-08-23 18:34:00,455,felt it at vic park and steeles. strange because i didnt feel last years but definetely felt it this year.
614826,Bernie,2011-08-23 18:35:00,3190,"I didn't feel it, but my brother upstairs did. Just goes to show I was too busy to notice."
