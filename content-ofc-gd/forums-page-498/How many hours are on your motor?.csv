614393,NAW,2011-08-22 15:54:00,4022,"I'm selling a motor for a freind.  It's a 1989 with 172.5 hours.  The guy bought it new, and documented every time he ran it.  Works out to around 8 hours a year.  Just wondering how many hours you guys have on your motors.  I've tried to guess mine, since I've owned it.  Must be atleast 10 to 15 hours a year of running.  I trol with my electric, if I didn't have that, it would be much more.."
614396,johnnyb,2011-08-22 16:00:00,3413,"I fish out of two different tinners....an 8hp and a 9.9hp....motors are almost always on....either trolling....puttering along shore...or ""running"".  (I use that term loosely, considering the hp we're talking about here  ) Now, being a weekend warrior only....I'd have to say that 20-25 hrs a season would be a generous estimate.  If I had a trolling motor....that would easily be cut in half.  "
614402,anders,2011-08-22 16:13:00,1168,"Brand new motor this year, and this weekend alone put 11 hours on it.  Easily 100 hrs this summer, and we ain't done yet!"
614404,glen,2011-08-22 16:14:00,2641,My fishfinder has an hour meter and it has over 500hrs on it. My motor would be about 75hrs a year.  I am doing about 225hrs a year of soft water fishing.
614405,mike rousseau,2011-08-22 16:15:00,4661,My 40 Honda runs 10-20 hours a week from mid may till mid dec...  So 280-560 hours per year...  Probably about 350-400 is an accurate representation of hours per year...  95 % of the time I'm trolling
614414,HTHM,2011-08-22 16:33:00,4082,Started the season at 446 am now at 503 on a 150 optimax. Just put my first gallon of oil in it Friday.
614430,NAW,2011-08-22 17:17:00,4022,The trolling really pushed the numbers up eh.  My electric has atleast 150+ hours on it when I roughly add up the time.  It's about 3 years old.
614433,Fisherman,2011-08-22 17:31:00,7201,"1996,25 HP Honda, I would have to say probably over 1000 hours, doesn't burn any oil, runs well and no, it's not for sale."
614538,Dutch,2011-08-22 21:56:00,831,"Less than 100.....  Seriously, I laugh everytime I read that line in a used boat ad.  There is really no accurate way to determine the number of hours n an outboard UNLESS you have one that you can get a readout from the computer.  Having said that, as long as you are happy with it and have maintained it well, the number of hours shouldn't matter."
614552,Spiel,2011-08-22 22:33:00,9065," Really, so the hour meter I have installed on mine is worthless? I'd go as far as to say it seems to be quite accurate as I check it after every outing.  As for how many hours, not nearly enough!   "
614554,spincast,2011-08-22 22:42:00,3279,A lot less than I would like
614556,bubbles,2011-08-22 22:47:00,591,Not enough
614566,Dutch,2011-08-22 22:59:00,831," Speaking strictly from research and not practical experience and with a resale idea in mind - hour meters can be disconnected and installed with little effort, like an old car's speedo.  Also, there's no way to tell how many hours were on the motor when it went on assuming aftermarket as there aren't too many manufacturers out there that put them on standard."
614570,misfish,2011-08-22 23:03:00,29133,"  Shame on you bud,,,,,,,,,,,   Wish you could.   How bout I come drive down and throw the riggers on and we go out? I have learned/been told,it,s called an ENGINE. Ya ,im becoming reformed.LOL"
614575,RickOnt,2011-08-22 23:17:00,669,"The ""BIG"" thing here # of Hours not a Huge issue if the Maintenance has been vigilant.  Low hours and no use/maintenance is much worse!!  Rick"
614613,Tybo,2011-08-23 01:53:00,1373,"180 and 3 year old ""engine"".Done a 10th of the fishing this year then normal."
614615,Pigeontroller,2011-08-23 02:01:00,2793,"05 Yamaha 90HP 4-stroke, tickling 1000 hrs (both on the hour meter and computer)  Runs better than ever.  "
614628,Sinker,2011-08-23 03:13:00,8692,I'm afraid to even guess how many are on mine. Lets just say LOTS!  S.
