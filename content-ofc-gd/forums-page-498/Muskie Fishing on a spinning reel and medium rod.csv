615223,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 21:24:00,4661,I'm not trying to change ehg s mind... That train is long gone... I just don't think he should be saying bass gear is ok for musky fishing to a noob...
615225,capt bruce,2011-08-24 21:28:00,820,"Most times in a post like this I can ussually find a joke or at least some silly thing to say . But I find this time I cant , Mike Terry is a great guy and has given good advise on this board for years , not the guy you want to fight with , he has said he agrees with you just not the meathod you are useing to convay your message .Before this gets locked ,muskie guys steelhead guys bass guys etc etc all love the fish they go after , lets just leave this at ""IF YOU GO AFTER BIG FISH YOU SHOULD USE BIG TACKLE ""no law says you have to , but if you want a chance to win your muskie rama , step up the gear . Hope I have not steped on any toes . Bruce"
615231,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 21:38:00,4661,  I'm not trying to get on your bad side Terry... Just proving a point... The Mnr had every right legally to do what they did... And like you said... It could have got nasty... If the op targets musky with light tackle... It can get nasty very fast...    This is a fishing site... We should all be on the same page as far as treating fish with respect...
615235,mercman,2011-08-24 21:53:00,7054," Bruce, i have admired you from afar for a long time, and it is advise like this, that strengthens my admiration for you. Excellent point you just made. Spoken from a wise man, having lived a wise life. Thanks for trying to re-orient this topic, as it is potentially a very interesting and important topic.  Paul"
615236,ehg,2011-08-24 22:04:00,2666,"Buddy, re-read the post.  I recommended that the OP doesn't use medium bass spinning gear for targeting musky.  Then mentioned that i use Medium-Heavy(Carolina-rigging) gear for Kawartha musky which i find personally more than adequate enough for the endless 32-40 inch muskies i catch. Thats all.  I didn't go against anyone else's recommendations which were all fine.But, 100 lb test and heavy musky gear seems like overkill for the Kawarthas exclusively.  Please don't personally attack me for nothing. Have contributed here for many, many years for many species and techniques successfully. Thanks"

And I have the right(to beat them down for approching  with threatening gesture with out properly identify themselfs)of self defence.  And what does this have to do with anything????
615251,mercman,2011-08-24 22:34:00,7054,"Geez,,,,Just when i thought it was calming down in here"
615256,GoneFishin,2011-08-24 22:40:00,349,I've caught almost every Musky in my life on light equipment and never had a problem with them running much or being tired at the side of the boat. How bad it could be to target them for a weekend without the right gear? I know there's the odd monster out there and you need to respect those fish and try to do what you can to make sure they go back unharmed but chances are he's not going to be getting into monsters throwing bass baits at them for a weekend imo. Now if your thinking about throwing larger baits that's a whole other subject. When I got my first musky rod I thought a 4oz max rating was over kill. Not quite!!! lol. I still worry about the tip snapping off during a back lash... and the pull some of those baits have is unreal and is enough to max out any mh or probably heavy bass rod.
615182,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 19:53:00,4661,  im asuming the person that started the thread doesnt have this gear... cause this stuff cost enough money... and they arent willing to get a proper rod...   and do whatever you want as far as rod size goes then... cause if youve caught 100s of musky and TRUTHFULLY      NEVER   had a bad situation due to an undersized rod... then sorry...  but ill    U ME  you have had a bad experience with a big fish cause of undersized gear... cause every musky angler i know has come across a situation where they wished they had bigger/better gear... i know i have...  or maybe you only ever get little dinks and knobody in the kawarthas EVER catchs respectable fish.... all the pictures ive seen of big kawartha fish must have been photoshoped...   and why even bother targeting musky if your never expecting to catch a fish over 15 pounds??? seems like a lot of effort for little results...
615184,mercman,2011-08-24 19:56:00,7054,"Geez, who's got the Viagra on sale today? I read Mikes comment as assuming the OP hasnt got a Musky setup, he probably doesnt have the necessary equipment.I guess it depends how you read it, right?"
615186,Gregoire,2011-08-24 19:58:00,1397,"I think people are losing focus of the question asked: Would a spinning reel and a medium action bass rod be appropriate for targeting musky?  The answer is a resounding no.  You can argue all you want about whether a spinning reel is appropriate for targeting musky...I think most musky guys who said no did so with the assumption that a bass size spinning reel was going to be used, not a larger saltwater reel.  The key is to use appropriate size equipment for the species you are targeting. For me that means planning to catch the biggest fish in the lake. So all you guys arguing that mh bass gear is appropriate are wrong in my opinion. As Musky Mike pointed out, truly large musky are rare in the Kawarthas, although it is unlikely that you will catch a 30+ pounder it could happen, and you will be woefully unprepared to land and release that beast alive using anything short very heavy gear. That type of logic really angers me. Maybe it is that attitude that makes trophy musky rare in the Kawarthas because people target them with bass gear and end up killing them.  I believe it is lactic acid that builds up in musky, not adrenaline that builds up in a Musky after a long fight and can cause a fatality."
615189,Terry,2011-08-24 20:00:00,14456,"clearly there are varied views on this  and I think having equipment that is made for large fish is better  but  there is no law or reg that says what you can catch them on   and I do put any one fish above any other fish  so you have the right to catch them on anything you like   and what people are saying here are suggestions, nothing more.. that what you want from this thread"
615190,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 20:01:00,4661,whatever...  use ultralights... 6 pound test... gaff your fish... dont use leaders... make sure you knock em out for pictures...  and oh yeah... stay away from the st.lawrence while you practice these brilliant musky tactics...
615191,SirWhite,2011-08-24 20:02:00,210,We will be fishing the Kawarthas as it is only an hour and a half away and the fishing is spectacular. Usually I go for Bass but we were catching 10-15 pound Muskie last time on bass setups so we decided on a Muskie Rally in Sept. I have two medium Ugly sticks and one light Shimano FX200 and one medium Shimano GX 130. This is why I'm worried. Would need a whole setup for cheap as I don't have a fishing savings plan setup yetlol.
615192,ehg,2011-08-24 20:03:00,2666, Yawn
615193,Gregoire,2011-08-24 20:05:00,1397," Terry I respect your point, but I'm just wondering what would happen if a person who was targeting musky with bass hear hooked into a large fish that was below the minimum size for the area and fought the fish for so long that the fish died. I know it is unlikely but could a CO who for whatever reason became aware of this situation charge the person with wasting a gamefish as the fish must be released?"
615195,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 20:08:00,4661,  wow  not saltwter gear???? not a carp rod???   who could have seen that coming???        sir white... sorry for jacking your thread... but you should not target musky with the gear you described....  at the very least go get one of those big ugly yellow or blue spinning rod and reel combos for 40 bucks and put heavy braid on it... 60 bucks for rod reel and line and those fat ugly rods can handle big fish... ive seen 30 pound carp landed on them...
615196,Terry,2011-08-24 20:11:00,14456, but  if you are not breaking any laws doing all the things you just posted  then they	do have ever right to do it...  again giving advise on muskie fishing is great  trying to beat in your opinion into them is wrong..it's only your opinion....
615198,mercman,2011-08-24 20:12:00,7054,"Before i made the decision to Hunt Musky, i asked people who do it, how i should equip myself. I Pmed people like Lew and Roy and asked advice. I used the info i got to equip myself with the best setup i could afford, without taking a motgage on my house No one who hunts Musky, ever told me to get spinning reels or MH bass rods to target this fish.And after catching my first St Lawerence Musky, i know why.Because my bass combo would have been destroyed, and the fish would have had to spend the rest of its life with my lure down its throat. Simple as that.I would even bet that the tiny musky in your original post pulled harder than any bass you have caught.  "

615201,jedimaster,2011-08-24 20:20:00,3472,Small Bass rods in the Medium range that was referred to is not suitable for musky.  Bigger spinning gear under the proper circumstances are fine.  Why is everyone so twisted about this? To say spinning gear is never acceptable for musky is silly. Heck I saw a very well respected fisherman catch and land a Shark on a MH Shimano Volteus spinning setup.
615202,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 20:21:00,4661,  they do have the right to do what they want...  i have the right to pull up beside you and rev my engine while your fishing...  or blast loud music...  doesnt mean its right...  come on... right and wrong is kindergarden stuff here... musky is one of the few freshwater fish that is sensitive to long battles... nobody should target them without the proper gear described by the experienced people on the board...
615203,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 20:22:00,4661, never said there is anything wrong with spinning gear...  just bass gear for musky...
615204,mercman,2011-08-24 20:23:00,7054,"   This from the guy who told me to ""Get Ready"" for it, 10 mins before i got my first one.Who suggested i use his gear because mine was a bit lite.(Thanks BTW) SirWhite. dropMusky Mike a PM, he will inform you of all you need to know without getting the hackles raised by a whole lotta dudes who stand by the way they do it.

615205,Terry,2011-08-24 20:24:00,14456, well it is no different then someone fishing for muskie with a conservation license ...their keep limit is 0 there can be a problem but it is legal  I in no way agree that using light equipment is right..but it is their right  and I think people should be nicer when they are trying to get people to change their ways and not beat down on people who fish with different but legal ethics.........  they have the right so calling them names does not get them to change and putting them down doesn't get them to change ........and if they don't change it is their right............if they are fishing within the law.... put your argument to the law makers and leave the people who are fishing within the law alone  just give them good advise and leave it at that

615222,Gregoire,2011-08-24 21:17:00,1397,"I think the original poster has gotten an answer to his question. Now it just seems like people, including myself, are in a pissing contest. I have to admit that I was a little angry at what people had posted, but Terry made a good point that insulting someone will not get them to change their mind. I was lucky that I learned how to fish for musky with an experienced angler. Not everyone has that privilege. Mike I do not think you are going to change anyones mind. The majority of musky hunters support your view. You don't need to keep banging your head on the wall."
614932,dave524,2011-08-24 00:30:00,4508,Lots of saltwater fishermen target saltwater fish in the 20 to 50 lb class with appropiate sized spinning gear and muskie are no match for a saltwater species pound for pound. Don't see any reason why it can't be done.
614934,johnnyb,2011-08-24 00:33:00,3413," Appropriate sized spinning gear is the key phrase here....I don't think the OP is talking about going and getting a beefy spinning outfit, but rather, putting heavier line on his all-round medium class combo."
614936,muskymike,2011-08-24 00:38:00,772, Saltwater fish are much more resilient then Musky as well. The water will still be relatively warm in September which doesn't help. Don't compare 2 completely different scenarios.  You dont bring a knife to a gun fight...
614939,esoxansteel,2011-08-24 00:45:00,1307,"  would you go to a gun fight with a knife, fishing muskies with tackle not suited for muskies, prolongs the fight of a very delicate fish, and will definately increase the chance at mortality, by building up accessive lactic acid, incidental muskie catches will occur with anglers fishing other species, but do not concentrate on muskies without the proper gear"
614941,esoxansteel,2011-08-24 00:51:00,1307,"  I have the 7ft compre muskie spinning rod, with a symetre 4000, spooled with 80lb, use it for pitching jigs, reapers etc, and stick baits, its tough and will handle muskies and get them to the boat quick, its technique specific, and use it about 10% of the time, 90% its baitcasters though, would not recommend it as your first and only muskie stick, as its use is limited"
615067,jedimaster,2011-08-24 15:07:00,3472,"I have a 7 foot Extra Heavy Clarus spinning rod with a 4000 Symetre, and I have caught many musky with it without much dificulty, including a 48 incher. I prefer this rod for flipping plastics on finicky days. I use 50 pound power pro and a 75 pound floro leader with it. Most musky fishing is with the baitcasters and they are by far stronger and have beefier drags."
615074,eman,2011-08-24 15:18:00,101,"if you have a medium heavy baitcasting outfit for bass, you could modiy it with 60lb braid and should be able to handle a decent size fish.  even if you set up your medium spinning rod with heavy duty line (braid 60 lb or greater) you should be able to handle fish but run of the risk of two things. Snapping you rod because you can't use the rod as backbone to muscle the fish.....and ruing the drag on your spinning reel."
615118,Millhouse2020,2011-08-24 16:22:00,152,"When I started my muskie fishing, MH to heavy bass tackle will suffice to get you started.  Good leaders and 30lb plus line are a must as well.  Even with heavy bass tackle, you cannot throw the largest of muskie baits but you can get by tossing bucktails and trolling decent sized plugs and spinners.  Plus of course you can use this tackle for bass, pike, lakers etc.  No sense spending a small fortune on new gear for a short venture.  I try to make sure a lot of my outdoor gear can do double duty if possible since they dont give it away...  I agree that using light tackle is not recommended for several reasons, most important, stress to the fish due to a prolonged battle or possibly losing a fish with the lure still lodged.  Damaging your takle is less of an issue to me versus hurting the fish.  If you are serious about muskie fishing then getting more specific equipment is appropriate.  It doesnt have to be the most expensive latest and greatest setup, but something designed to handle big fish adequately.  As muskie fishing has got more popular, they make a lot more equipment now geared specifically to muskie fishing at various price points.  Im sure you can get an entry level outfit from basspro for under $200.  I am still using one dedicated muskie stick for practically ALL my muskie fishing, casting, trolling, bucktails, plugs etc and I has served me well.  Havent lost or hurt a fish yet and have landed some trophies.  Buy the best you can reasonably afford, take care of it and it will serve you well.  Millhouse2020"
615128,hutch4113,2011-08-24 16:52:00,374," I have a spinning reel setup.  Bought it at Bass Pro shop.  It is a MH rod (BPS rod), with a BPS spinning reel.  Wide mouth spool, so it holds lots of line, and casts extra long (really...really....really long).  Had 60 pound Power Pro Braided on it, but have since taken it down to 30 pound.  Caught a 47 inch Muskie with it on Balsam Lake, with zero issues.  Fish was in the boat in about 10 minutes (had to let it run a couple of times).  At no point did the rod give any indication it could not handle the fish.  The only downside of the combo is the lures.  Before purchasing a MH or H spinning rod, verify how large of lure (weight size) it can handle.  A baitcaster can definitely handle lures that are much heavier.  Not a big deal when trolling...but I broke a spinning rod casting with a lure that was too heavy for it.  But...at somepoint...I will start experimenting with a baitcaster....as was mentioned in a previous post...to add another tool to the box."
615142,Raf,2011-08-24 17:27:00,3495,"10 minutes is waaay too long.  People should stick to commenting on things they know about, seems to me OFNCs become a lot of people who've caught a fish once upon a time saying what's ok and what isn't - there's some seriously flawed advice in this thread.  On the flipside, heed advice from those who've been der done dat.  Reminds me of a couple going out fishing with a guide.. the wife outfishes the hubby.  why? cause she actually listens and does to what the guide has to say.   Who better to know the water and the fish in it than the guide or, in this case people with years of experience."
615146,solopaddler,2011-08-24 17:38:00,8605, So...only those with vast amounts of experience need reply?  Everyone's opinion is valuable and appreciated as far as I'm concerned.
615149,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 17:58:00,4661,I agree with RAF...  There are zero circumstances where it is ok to use a little bass size spinning combo for musky... Unless you get yourself a bigger saltwater spinning outfit or a beefy carp rod or something like it...  And 10 minutes is deffinately way too long...  Most of my battles are 1-2 minutes tops...  I have also had musky snap 50lb braid like it was 6lb... That's why I stick to 100lb braid...  This is just one of those situations where you should target something else...
615154,scugpg,2011-08-24 18:15:00,1373," I landed a 42'' last year trolling in the fall on a 6'6 MH w/ a shimano baitcaster w/65lb braid. No issues on that size fish but repetitive on that setup would wear out the reel pretty quick if its pulling drag all the time.  When you start targeting 40+ inch fish on a regular basis you should really be looking at heavier tackle.  From what I've seen on TV, doing figure 8's at the boat and have the fish smash it so close to the boat would really break light tackle in a hurry.  Having a proper net and tools to get the hooks and fish out of the net is just as important. I bet quite a few fatalities are related to fish being improperly held or stuck in the net out of the water."
615155,ehg,2011-08-24 18:18:00,2666,"Using a medium bass spinning outfit is not a good idea.  Much of what you are using depends upon what body of water you are fishing. In the Kawarthas the fish are usually 32-40 inches or 5-15 lbs. There really is no reason to get over the top musky gear for the small Kawartha muskies. If you are fishing Georgian Bay, Ottawa River or St. Lawrence R. You might need heavy braids and heavier musky equipment as hitting a world record size fish is possible.  Personally use MH bass baitcasting equipment as i fish Kawarthas exclusively. Still feel like i am effortlessly winching in the fish too quickly.  Where are you fishing?"
615156,Gregoire,2011-08-24 18:19:00,1397,"  While it is true that everyone does have a right to an opinion, not everyone's opinion should be considered equal. If you don't agree with me, ask yourself if you would want your mechanic to give you a vasectomy, or your doctor to fix your breaks."
615162,lew,2011-08-24 18:30:00,12766," Your absolutely right Mike, everyones opinion IS appreciated, but as often happens around here, someone asks for advice on something, and folks who know nothing about it are offering advice even though it's totally wrong.  RAF is 100% correct in that if you don't know how to properly do something, then perhaps no answer is better than a wrong answer.  I've never river fished or even used one of those fancy type reels that you use, and when someone asks questions about that type of stuff I just sit back and let those in the know, like yourself, answer the question.  As for using a spinning reel for muskies....nope."
615163,mercman,2011-08-24 18:39:00,7054,"So...There you go SirWhite(like the name BTW same last name as me)  To deliberately target Musky without the proper equipment, and not taking the well being of the fish into consideration,is not recommended. Since they are one of the most fragile of freshwater game fish,the majority of the experts here are respectfully against what you have in mind. I suggest you follow this advice and get an introductory level combo, and the tools required to release the fish healthy. Be sure you know how to handle them during release and photos also.Its a whole different ballgame compared to Bass and Walleye fishing. Trust me, once bitten by the Musky bug, you will be hooked. Give these beasts the respect they deserve and outfit yourself accordingly."
615165,solopaddler,2011-08-24 18:41:00,8605,"  It's funny you mention steelheading Lew.  The tackle used by most is really specialized. It helps you catch more fish quickly and efficiently.  However I can honestly say it's not necessary to catch fish.  Myself, I could catch just just as many on a run of the mill 7' spinning rod and reel.  To say no to using a spinning reel for musky, sorry I don't buy it.  It's obviously not the tool most musky guys will choose for a lot of good reasons already mentioned.  But a suitably heavy enough spinning combo will handily suffice for a novice who fishes for them very occasionally.  (In my opinion for whatever that's worth, )"
615166,jedimaster,2011-08-24 18:43:00,3472,"  Would you as an shade tree mechanic change your oil or do your own brakes? a small minor job like fishing for sub 45"" musky in the kawarthas is not the same typ of fishing as going for 50+ on the french day in day out.  I don't think any here has said that spinning gear is the best. But if your headed once, in all likelyhood going to catch a max of 2 or 3 ski's in the kawarthas most likely to bu 45"" or less than heavier bass gear will do just fine. If your going out day in and day out then yah heavier musky baitcasting gear is much better suited.  A medium action bass rod though is pretty small and is obviously a poor choice for targeting musky. An accidental hook up is one thing but targeting  musky with a medium action rod is not a great idea. The reel offers a couple things when musky fishing. Drag power and cranking power. Drag power in most spinning reels is half that or less of most musky setups. However with my musky reels I have straightened hooks on bigger musky, so my drag is normally set much lower than full. The drag power offered from a 4000 series real is stout enough to hand a sub 40 musky to the point where your not likely to have the drag set to full anyway.  Cranking power is something else, with thinner longer handles on most spinning reels your likely to bend your handle on your spinning reel if your reeling in fish after big fish.  The rod offersyou the backbone to cast the big lures, set the hook and use its length and strength to help pull the fish in without breaking it.  Again an XH flipping stick or big frog rod offer these features in spinning setups for smaller musky.  The ideal scenario is to get the musky into the landing net or boat as fast as possible to lower the ammount of adrenaline produced in the fishes body. Its not actually adrenaline its some other chemical. When the fish is done fighting this chemical actuall puts the fish into a hibernation like coma, and this stresses and can kill the fish. The shorter the fight the better.  Another thing to consider is the out of water experience for the fish. Obviously the less hook damage the less its out of the water the better.  Keep everything in mind and make up your own mind. Musky fishing is very dear to many peoples hearts. If you are going to continue musky fishing then you should really invest in a musky combo. It will save you money on broken bits and pieces as well it will help you land bigger fish faster. A used Diawa Heartland and an Abu 6500 C3 should be able to be had for about 100 to 150 bucks. Someone has a pete mania used for 30 bucks. I'll sell you a diawa heartland heavy action musky rod for 50. then for an extra 20 get some 75 pound power pro and your off to the races for a 100 bucks.  The original question can Spinning gear be used for musky. The answer is yes, if its heavier gear, and if its used for smaller musky. For bigger musky if your stuck on spinning gear your talking about getting into  Inshore type rods and at that point you may as well go baitcaster."
615167,solopaddler,2011-08-24 18:45:00,8605," I don't think anyone was promoting the use of bass sized spinning equipment, I know I wasn't.  What do the more hardcore musky guys use when a lighter more finesse presentation is required?"
615168,jimmer,2011-08-24 18:54:00,2730,"I think that there are many large spinning reels that can do the job with heavy line. Geez, they use them in saltwater all the time. So if you're stuck on spinning combos, there are options. However, like most guys have said, baitcasters are the way to go. They are not that hard to learn if you use a quality reel. I can't wait to read your report in the fall. Good luck."

615170,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 18:54:00,4661,  in a way this is bad advice...  because if he does get a rare 50 inch kawarthas musky he will likely kill one of the biggest and most rare fish in the lake...  on the flipside... if you use small tackle on the st.lawrence river and kill a 50... well there are lots of big fish to take its place...  either way its a bad situation...     if there are decent size musky caught in the water being fished... 40 inch and up.... get the right gear!!  i dont really have all the right gear for salmon fishing safely and properly... so i found someone to take me...            also... if you dont have a musky rod... im willing to bet you dont have  knipex really long nose pliers cradle or musky net replacement hooks   so even if you do battle the fish to the boat properly... you wont have the right tools to deal with the fish safely.... youll get hurt...
615171,mike rousseau,2011-08-24 19:04:00,4661,"  well... im assuming he doesnt have big saltwater gear...  and the most finess way i know to fish is live bait.... i use a 7 foot 6 inch st.croix heavy action with 100 pound braid and a cuado 300...  this combo is expensive... but you can get a brand new rod and reel for musky for 150 spooled... gander mountain has musky rods for 50-100 bucks and a cheaper abu ambasador 60-100 bucks and 80lb+ braid  my first ""real"" musky combo was only 130 bucks spooled... still have it 10years later"
615179,ehg,2011-08-24 19:41:00,2666,"   Dude, i have fished Kawarthas for musky hardcore for almost thirty years. I think i know what i am talking about many 100's of musky later.  An assumption of not having knipex, long needle nose pliers, cradle, etc... is wrong.   What do they say about assumptions....."
614644,SirWhite,2011-08-23 07:57:00,210,"Was wondering if there is a way to beef up my three spinning combos for a September Muskie Rally with the guys. Was thinking to change from a mono line to some kind of braided so I can beef up the strength gear. Does this make sense? Ive also so heard braided line on a spinning reel has many drawbacks. I just want to not worry about missing ""that"" fish.  Anyone have answers  Noobie needs advice"
614646,ChrisK,2011-08-23 09:27:00,2772,Your combo is rated for a certain lb test so thats the limit. You can catch muskie on lighter gear but that means extended fighting time which will either end up in a very tired near death fish or a terminal tackle fail with the muskie swimming away with your bait in his mouth. Either way I would not recommend targeting muskie with a spinning outfit unless it was rated at least medium to heavy action /17 to 20 lb
614673,mike rousseau,2011-08-23 12:08:00,4661,Don't do it!!!!
614678,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-08-23 12:26:00,1107,You can get a musky combo from BPS for $200 they can't be that bad here's a link would be a lot easier than trying to use a medium spining combo  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Muskie-Angler-Rod-and-Reel-Combos/product/10205092/-1668576
614679,Fish4Eyes,2011-08-23 12:30:00,1022,I have herd stories of people getting pulled around in their cannoe and stripped of all their line because they caught an incidental muskie while pickerel fishing with lighter tackle. Would hate to see you lose the big one you worked so hard for.
614685,Roy,2011-08-23 12:38:00,13728," That reel is the Pete Maina reel, relabeled. It is identical."
614690,OhioFisherman,2011-08-23 12:44:00,6623,"Poor tools for the job, take that from an expert, at losing them! LOL Do you really want to endanger the fish? It can be done, but not regularly. There is a reason why they sell muskie tackle."

614713,bigbuck,2011-08-23 13:53:00,2449,"The Pete Maina reels (Muskie Angler) are decent for the price point. For someone just getting into muskie fishing, you already have a great rod, save a few bucks on the reel for now and focus on release tools. I helped some clowns out on Pigeon lake last year that had a small pair of rusty pliers and no net, the muskie was hooked and when it thrashed with buddie's hand near it's mouth, two trebles deep hooked his hand, they had no way of cutting the hook and his fingers were a couple of inches from the muskie's mouth. I helped them out and cut the hook off the lure so buddy could get his hand away from the fish and cut the one treble that went right through his hand, the other was his problem (I told him to head straight to the hospital), and cut the hook out of the poor muskie's mouth (by this time it was either dead or too late to do anything for it). For my troubles, the wind blew us up against the rocks on the western side of Big Island and my boat scraped up against them, $600 in damage to the gel coat. There won't be a next time for me to help out guys who aren't prepared. I'm still PO'd about it and will be for a long time."
614715,mercman,2011-08-23 13:58:00,7054,"Take it from another Musky Noob.I caought my first, with the help of Musky Mike, an expert.It was only a 42 incher, but if i was using my setup instead of his, i would have lost both fish and equipment. This fish fights like nothing i have ever caught before.It requires a minimum MH to H rod and reel setup. If you will be targeting them often, invest in equipment made to handle them.Its surprisingly inexpensive to get a good combo for Musky.  Good luck, and get ready for some trippin  "
614743,johnnyb,2011-08-23 15:19:00,3413,"Even if you're just going for one weekend of musky fishing....don't risk your tackle or the fish's well-being....nothing wrong with having a new combo....and if you decide it's not for you, sell it on the board.  Difference between what you spent and what you sell it for = tackle rental fee"
614879,SirWhite,2011-08-23 21:58:00,210,Thanks for the advice guys. I did kinda figure id need new equipment. But I never even thought about the impact id have on the fish! gonna change up for sure. Just been on a spinning combo all my fishing life and at 33 Im not sure if Baitcast rod/reel is something I can pick up right away (ive heard some horror stories) Is it unwise to change reels before a big fishing weekend? is it really that hard to switch from spinning to baitcasting?
614884,lew,2011-08-23 22:14:00,12766," Sadly SirWhite, that's an impression FAR too many folks have when they think they'd like to try a baitcaster. It's simply another tool in the box, and with a little bit of practice you'll be casting with no problems before you know it.  Just a tool, a very simple tool, and nothing more.  Go ahead and buy one  and enjoy."
614894,daryl0815,2011-08-23 22:35:00,225," Baitcasting can be a little to get used to, but it is far better for heavier applications, and given the heavy weight of most muskie lures you should not have much of an issue with birds-nests as long as you keep the brakes tight on it, and hey if you are trolling you will have no issues at  all, just let the line out behind the boat!"
614896,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-23 22:40:00,0,"i learned to cast a baitcaster when i was 11 years old... it might take you a spool of line to get it, but it's really not that bad.  and others have said, medium tackle is possible, but risky and unethical."

614898,BucktownAngler,2011-08-23 22:48:00,582,"does anybody use a heavy spinning setup for musky?  i personally use a baitcasting setup, but i dont see why you can't buy a large spinning reel and use it on a MH or H rod.

614899,Terry,2011-08-23 22:49:00,14456,having the right equipment is the way to go  however  I fish for muskie every year and I use the right equipment........but somehow I catch most of my muskie on light spinning rods  if they don't bit me off in the first couple of seconds I almost always get the in the boat fairly fast..  now I do use 20/ 30lb braid on my reel but I do not tighten up the drag..you can easily burn out the reel  what I do in the case of a big fish is put my finger on the spool to stop it from spinning and pull back on the rod then quickly take up the slack with the reel with my finger off..then repeat till the fish is in the boat  use the rod and not the reel  but if you are targeting muskie get the right stuff for the job
614909,mercman,2011-08-23 23:18:00,7054," I learned Baitcaster at 55 so whats the big deal It is always good to know how to use the different tools available to us. It\ll take you a day of pratcice, and you will be an expert. Go for it for your sake and the Musky's too"
614910,solopaddler,2011-08-23 23:22:00,8605,"I have a custom spinning rod Spiel built for me rated 10-17lb's.  VERY fast action as well as light and sensitive.  I run a 4000 Sustain on it with 30lb braid for large pike and have never had an issue.  I'll run baits as heavy as 11/2oz with this rod, nothing heavier.  In my opinion, in all but the most specific type of musky fishing, fishing where stout rods and larger baits are an essential ingredient, a lighter setup is more than adequate.  I'm certainly not in the same class of musky angler as many on this board, but I used to be into it pretty hardcore and have caught a few goliaths.  In my experience the bigger muskies all came in pretty easily LOL!  Set the hook, a couple runs here, another run there, and bam they're boatside in the cradle.  Without offending the sensibilities of the hardcore musky guys, the power of these fish is way overblown.  The super heavy tackle comes in play when the presentation requires it, not because of the strength of the fish.  In most waters a 11/2oz black/orange bucktail and a well built med/hvy spinning combo with 30lb braid will serve you well."
614917,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-23 23:57:00,130,"That is a strange setup for Muskie. I would not say it is unethical but is a bit irresponsible or maybe jerky like:  -a couple of hundred yards of stripped braid in lake = bad -snapped in half rod because you were using braid on a light rod = bad -big musky that takes forever to cpr (if it can be) = bad -other Musky guys pointing and whispering about your setup = bad (who cares, they are musky guys) -busted rod because the med will not throw or troll the large baits without eventually breaking = bad -everyone waiting forever for you to bring in the big fish = bad  I think SoloPaddler is dead on. There are a lot of Muskie nuts who say nothing less than 100 lb braid and a telephone pole guy for a leader blah blah blah..... Get your lure weight/type in line with the rod capabilities. If the rally has problem with that they should have set out rules on equipment like some tournaments do for the boats used."
614918,mercman,2011-08-24 00:02:00,7054,So is a 7ft MH Compre paired with a Currado 300E a good setup?
614920,irishfield,2011-08-24 00:04:00,26272,Fish what ever you have Paul... they fish for 100lb angry Tarpon with 40lb power pro!
614922,mercman,2011-08-24 00:08:00,7054,Thanks Wayne...these types of threads always leave me feeling inadequate.... NOT. The drag is your firend.
614929,Raf,2011-08-24 00:24:00,3495," if it's a muskie rod, it's fine.  a muskie MH rod is a different animal than a bass MH rod.  The 300 is more than adequate and many guys like them for muskie fishing  size of lures is one thing as is the size of the fish you're going after. if you're fishing a body of water with 10-15lb snakes you should have little issue catching them on bass gear.  if you're fishing water with 30,40lb fish be prepared for heartbreak."
