615079,scottyswing,2011-08-24 15:28:00,37,"Hey gang, was wondering if anyone had any electronic copies of depth charts for some local lakes, namely Lake Niapenco reservoir. Read some chats about it online, but haven't found anything to back it up. I'm sure one of you lovely OFC members can share with me  Cheers!"
615084,mercman,2011-08-24 15:35:00,7054,"As far as i know,these navionics cards are unable to be copied I did alot of searching on the web, and everything i have come up with says no.I even read that it may damage the original card. i could be wrong though."
615085,scottyswing,2011-08-24 15:37:00,37, You'd think there would be a way to upload them to your computer and print them out. I'd write the company.
