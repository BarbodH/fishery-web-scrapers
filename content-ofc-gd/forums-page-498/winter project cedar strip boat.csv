614214,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-22 02:37:00,2690,"Sure looks like it could be a Giesler.  My better half's dad has spent many hours restoring one over the last few years. PM me if you wish any information.  I'm sure Craig would be happy to share any tips or info that he has. That boat has been a labour of love for him, and, ironically Long Point may be where she is re-launched for the first time.  Cheers, Frank"

614247,Bernie,2011-08-22 10:49:00,3190,"Yes, that is a Giesler boat. That appears to be a Nipissing Special. An 18 ft. We still build new ones. If you need any parts for it, let me know."
614249,lew,2011-08-22 10:57:00,12766,Saw about 6 new ones outside your shop when I drove down hwy 11 Saturday morning Bernie.  Quality boats for sure !!
614285,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-22 12:52:00,2690," I thought so!  Is your shop in Powassan?  If so you've probably met or dealt with my better half's dad Craig Meadows.  He's picked up all his materials for his rebuild there.  Freshtrax, I'll send you some pics and a phone # in a PM when I get a chance."
614320,Bernie,2011-08-22 14:01:00,3190,My cousin Gerry operates the boat shop in Powassan. His father Pete still is there in the office. He remembers everyone.  I operate the auto shop. My brother operates the Marine.

614546,basketclam,2011-08-22 22:16:00,115,"That's a great looking boat.  I don't have many memories of my gramp, as he died when I was quite young.  But I distictly remember the day his old boat (truely his, because he built it) got torn up for scrap shortly after his death.  If I'd only been a little older, a little bolder, I might have saved that boat."
