614603,coolwater,2011-08-23 00:47:00,43,I'm thinking of taking my 6yr  old grandson fishing at either Valens or Christies CA .  Does anyone have any opinion as to whether either is better and if so where to fish for panfish.   	thanks
614610,aquaman456,2011-08-23 01:47:00,13,TONS of underwater vegetation at Valens. Reeled a bunch of that stuff in last time i was there... Nice place though!
614624,ld17,2011-08-23 02:43:00,319,If your fishing from shore Valens has a nice bridge to fish off of.  Lots of panfish there.  It's the better place to catch nice sized panfish and possible big pike and bass.
614664,coolwater,2011-08-23 11:35:00,43," Thanks guys, no boat, so I think I'll give Valens a try."
614666,nuke,2011-08-23 11:47:00,60,"Very nice place indeed.  Don't forget Snagalot, it's catch and release though.  Just in case you caught something worth bringing home!  Have fun with the young one. Mike"
614757,pikehunter,2011-08-23 15:38:00,1659," I think you can still rent paddleboats at Valens and fish around the island.  Christie has several stocked ponds, call them first to find out the last time they stocked them. Very light line, small hook, corn, worms and waxworms.  Or save the admission fees and go down to Pier 4 Park or Bayfront Park in Hamilton and he may have a lot of fun there too. Lots of comfortable shoreline spots at Bayfront with shade and picnic tables."
614793,Mike Pike,2011-08-23 17:28:00,1332,I echo Pikehunters words.  Hammy Harbour has tons of shore access and you could take the fella for a pop at Williams or for fries at Hutch's.  Binbrook Conservation Area is also close to ya.  Took my nephew's little guy there last weekend.  Nice long deck to fish from near the boat launch.  Just a couple other options for ya to confuse matters.  lol
615427,coolwater,2011-08-25 15:07:00,43,"Thanks again for all your input.   We tried Valens but the shoreline was choked with weeds  and the bridge produced not one bite.  Tried some of the fishing docks but they were enclosed with weed growth.  Lost lots of sinkers and hooks.   Probably try Christie next time based on what the Pikehunter had to say.  We went to Binbrook the same day, caught a lot of  small sunfish and bass (verrry small lol), but will likely try there again off the docks.   Great site, and we appreciate all the suggestions you fellas have."
615441,eman,2011-08-25 15:36:00,101," I grew up around Christies and fished there alot as kid and into my teens. The stocked trout ponds produced very few fish over the years. Caught a few largemouth bass by the dam but that was along time ago. They constantly are draining the lake, so weeds rarely get a chance to grow. I have seen the lake drained and there is zero structure. Probably the worsdt option of the three but I haven't been back in at least 5 years.  Binbrook is your best option. I have caught largies on the rocks by the dam and a bunch of eatable crappies too. I usually go there once or twice a year cause has a lot of shore fishing. Bass - small crankbaits and blue fox spinners. crappies - little jigs.  Valens had fish many years ago but the last two times I went I got skunked.....I have no faith in that place."
