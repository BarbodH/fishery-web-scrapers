Had a hard time keeping the vultures away. They had eaten 4qts of fresh peaches overnight  Will be at least another week before I'm allowed off my leash to go fishing, but I might still need the chauffeur.  Elderberries are ripe now. Time to stock up so I can make some more brandy."
614540,basketclam,2011-08-22 22:03:00,115,"Awesome looking stuff!  Alas, I don't think there will be any home canning for the pantry at my house this year.  I haven't had time to pick and my wife hasn't had time to can."
614541,irishfield,2011-08-22 22:07:00,26272,Never been a fan of dill pickles Bruce... but when's the Brandy gonna be ready???
614548,Bill Shearer,2011-08-22 22:21:00,456,"Probably two weeks before the Elderberries are ready here in Hamilton. (domestic variety, not wild)"

614578,bigugli,2011-08-22 23:39:00,6138,Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.
614579,mercman,2011-08-22 23:41:00,7054,  Yup.....Thats the one
614582,bigugli,2011-08-22 23:46:00,6138,I usually don't cook up the berries til after picking season is done. That way the brew is ready for Christmas. I have just a wee bit left to tide me over til then 
614593,mike rousseau,2011-08-23 00:17:00,4661,I wish I knew how to do that stuff... I have a hard time pickling wieners...
614597,mercman,2011-08-23 00:30:00,7054, So thats what i look like on your screen. It really does add 10 lbs
614600,bigugli,2011-08-23 00:36:00,6138,You'll just have to drink yerself pretty
614651,pikehunter,2011-08-23 09:59:00,1659,"That, is a lot of hard work and dedication!  I am astounded  It has been a good many years since I have seen so many home made canned goods. I remember my mother and father spending hours in the kitchen doing just what you did. Funny how when a kid I became accustomed to home canning and took it for granted, the beats, cucumbers and tomatoes...nothing like canned tomatoes, years later mom would freeze them, easier, but not anywhere near the same.  Went to my wife's friends brother's farm one time years ago. We ended up filling the trunk of my '76 Royal Monaco with pears, all free. Went to mom and dad's and broke out the canning jars. We spent hours preparing them, they were fantastic! Didn't like store bought canned pears before that and still don't, the home canned were fantastic!  For quality and knowing where your food comes from home preparation is a must. Especialy these days. All the grocery store canned fruit are coming from China and many brands of pickles now come from India... neither I will buy. However Bick's still come from Dunnville ON.  Thanks for posting your pictures and the memories."
614797,bigugli,2011-08-23 17:38:00,6138,Bicks used to have plants all over Ontario. The one in Scarborough closed years ago. Rumor has it the Dunnville plant is again slated to shut down.
614799,fishnsled,2011-08-23 17:47:00,3520, It may take a lot for this to happen....  How much inventory do you have? Sorry Paul - couldn't resist.
614812,bigbuck,2011-08-23 18:05:00,2449,"That brandy sure looks dee-lish!!! Nothing like some good home brew to put hair on your tongue. I remember as a 3 year old when my granny was busted for making home brew (from the grape skins), the neighbour across the street came to warn us a half hour ahead of the bust (he was a po). The still was broken up and tossed in all the surrounding neighbours yards but they got 2 casks of baba's best. I'm sure it was disposed of one shot at a time. Those canned peaches look soooo good!!! I too am not a fan of pickles but canned peaches and pears during the winter months are great."
615258,rockfish,2011-08-24 22:49:00,91,That bottle must have been well hidden from my view when I was over picking up jigs last night.
615261,misfish,2011-08-24 23:04:00,29133,Thanks Bruce for the pm reply.  Going to busy the next few weeks.
