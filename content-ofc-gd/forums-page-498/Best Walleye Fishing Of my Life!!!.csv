613540,mike rousseau,2011-08-19 12:45:00,4661,last night was by far the best day of walleye fishing ive ever had...  i managed to get 2 guys to come out with me last night... so i was exited to have 3 lines in the water to up our chances... i decided to only hit the spots that have really been producing... and did they ever produce... first spot we boated 6 in less then an hour... and it went on like this all night...  at the end of the night we finished with  35 walleye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 smallies and last but not least a rockbass...  we had 2 triple headers and 4 double headers.... triple headers? ive never had triple headers... we were fighting for the net and flashlight...  35 walleye in 5 hours makes it a fish every 10 minutes or less!!!!  and the size was there as well... we boated about 10 fish 24 inches and up!!!  and one of the double headers got us a 26inch and a 27inch walleye... biggest double header ive ever had... or heard of...(BOQ aside)  now keep in mind... im not up north... im in south eastern ontario...  the whole boat was literally giggling all night.... biggest smiles ever... we just couldnt stop giggling...  and when we hit the 30 fish mark... youll never gueass what happened................ fireworks...lol... i couldnt freaken believe it... just as i was releasing number 30... a local cottager set of some fireworks... it felt like they were just for us....  anyways... after a night like that... i could go on and on... so heres the pics   BTW........ one of the smallies was over 5 pounds...
