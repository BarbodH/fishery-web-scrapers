268741,brian.millar,2008-11-18 01:55:00,12,Should have bought my boat sooner.    Its going to be a long time until June.  Any suggestions on things to pass the time.  Hope I dont regret this post haha.
268874,young_one,2008-11-18 08:05:00,620,"haha there's plenty -manage your tackle box -clean your lures, check for rust and change hooks -lubricate your reels -whipe your fishing rods -think about new goals next year, new target species? -potential boat accesories? -watch WFN and get cabin fever -post and reply on OFC!"
268885,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-18 12:05:00,3761,"ya do when young_one said. I re organized my box cleaned up the reels and rods and lures i had, changed a few hooks and sharpened many more. And cut off all knots on the lures and hooks. Don't worry bass season will be here soon enough..."

268960,ohhenrygsr,2008-11-18 16:00:00,947,  Yea this is what i do.  Since i tournament fish i also set a budget on a spreadsheet and tally all my expenses and winnings.  Organization is Key to being successful on the water.
268962,Zib,2008-11-18 16:04:00,369,You can always bring your boat to Michigan. The smallmouth on St. Clair hit silver buddies (blade bait) really good in the cold water. Our bass season doesn't end until Dec. 31st.    Or you can go down to Florida since their bass season is open all year.

268982,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-18 16:57:00,2038,"How about getting in a Muskie outing or two.....  Like this weekend should be prime time for skis, nice and cool  But i hear ya ,,being a Bass guy myself i'm going through withdrawal as we speak"
268983,jwl,2008-11-18 17:02:00,1056,"trout fishing, pike fishing, perch fishing, musky fishing  , guess I am lucky living in the Niagara Region there is always something open to fish for 12 months a year...I didn't think there was actually a ""fishing season""  , just renew the liscence Jan 2nd season"
268987,JMahon,2008-11-18 17:06:00,48,There's still 13 days left!   My suggestion is to get out there a few more times!!  lol Then I'd have to agree with others.....STEELIES!  Then dust off your snow suit & get ready for some ice fishin!! There's plenty of fishin to be had year round & in between the seasons!!
269067,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-18 20:06:00,2050,"Ice fishing for largies!  The lake I target panfish in has an over-abundance of pint sized largemouth - they're a damn nuisance when you're fishing for perch and gills....  Seriously though, There's still plenty of LEGAL bassin' to be had, two more weeks here at home, and longer if you're willing to head down to buffalo.  The state side of Erie has some of it's best smallmouth fishing right up until christmas!  cheers, UF"
