267324,Leecher,2008-11-14 03:13:00,7832,Hey Dan..... you sure you didn't mean Ice Fishing Pics instead
267335,danbo,2008-11-14 04:04:00,2646,I'm curious about what Portable Huts everyone's using..

267387,joonmoon,2008-11-14 14:44:00,528,Well insulated...
267389,joonmoon,2008-11-14 14:49:00,528,Heres our huts.........  
267398,Rich,2008-11-14 15:18:00,3927,"Joonmoon, you like the ice cube? I keep debating purchasing one, but hear mixed reviews."
267404,joonmoon,2008-11-14 15:31:00,528,"Hey Rich It sets up in seconds and keeps you out of the wind. I like it because it folds up into a dufflebag with shoulder straps about 3'long, doesn't take up near the room a hut with a sled does. My only issue with it is it's lack of portability. Everytime you wanna move you have to completely knock it down and re assemble, whereas the flip style huts are way more user friendly for moving around a lot. The cube anchors to the ice with large screws and straps with tension adjusters on it. Its not very rain proof so better suited for clear days or snowy days. Its a good buy for money you'll spend. Way cheaper than the flip huts. I would recommend it."

267562,Leecher,2008-11-14 23:39:00,7832," Ahhhh OK..... I don't use huts unless it's -30C but got caught fishing @ -35C with the wind shield and no shack..... had to build a fire to unfrozen my toes and that day caught 2 sturgeons, one was 17Lbs and the other 4Lbs.  Are you sure you don't want to see a few pics of last years hard water season?? Cause I gots lots! Leechman"
267567,misfish,2008-11-14 23:51:00,29133," I triple dare ya. Go ahead,make my day,,,,,,,oh sorry,night."
267569,Leecher,2008-11-15 00:04:00,7832, OK you twist my arm    all fish were CPR'd  Here goes    It's pike slabs and perch for this little outing                                  That day were just a frenzy and went throught 4Dz's of minnows  Hope you enjoy Leechman
267571,misfish,2008-11-15 00:08:00,29133,You see ya bit. Now I know yer spot.LOL  Nice slabs. Thanks for sharing Leechman. 
267572,Leecher,2008-11-15 00:19:00,7832," Hey misfish.... if you ever come up to the Outaouais region for hard water season.... send me a pm, would be an honour to go out fishing with you..... the mighty Ottawa has lots to offer Jacques"
267573,danbo,2008-11-15 00:25:00,2646,Good stuff!      I'm just gonna get the HT Windbreak for shelter.
267575,Leecher,2008-11-15 00:30:00,7832,"Dan..... that goes for you too     The only time I'm in an ice shelter is when I go to an Outfitter..... it's nice to get warm but once you enter, just don't want to get out.  Jacques"
267600,limeyangler,2008-11-15 02:00:00,5204,"i'm thinkin of getting one of those flip up shelters that folds into a sled. I mean i stand out there in -35 with 30kmh winds...uncomfortable but bareable...just. My reasoning is....a place to warm up...cant see myself wanting to sit in the dark, i need a sled for the snow machine, and my wife has said she will join me way more often if i have one...bonus! Now its just which one...lol...Frabill, Clam, Otter, Eskimo........"
