268950,Greencoachdog,2008-11-18 15:26:00,8163,"In retrospect, I think this was advance Good Karma for the very good thing you did with the Fire Dept. Cliff!  You may also want to prepare for Post Good Karma too!"
267447,ccmtcanada,2008-11-14 18:51:00,7971,"After the rains we had yesterday, I just had to take the day off work.  We just went through a huge corporate re-structure, and even though I was not affected, many of my friends were.  It's been a tense week to say the least.  Bly and I got up at around 6, and decided to hit an eastern trib to see if the rain we had was enough to push up a fresh batch of fish....and man oh man....we were not disappointed!!  We got there around 7:30 to see a few others already in the area, but none where we like to drift.  In my first 5 drifts, I had 3 hits...but was having hookset issues!  After adjusting a bit and concentrating a bit more, the fish just started coming in....one after another!   The final tally between the two of us was 15 landed...and about a half dozen lost in the fight.  I had one on at one point that just didn't stop!!  It was a monster, but I just couldn't turn it around.  About a minute after the fight began, it snapped my 6lb leader....  Didn't really matter...here's some fish porn....not too bad for 4.5 hours of fishing.                        "
267449,timmeh,2008-11-14 18:54:00,609,Looks like an awesome day!! I'm still waiting for my first day like that.
267450,anders,2008-11-14 19:00:00,1168,"WOW good job.  That big silver male looks like a brute!  How big was that.  I am going to hit the Michipicoten tomorrow for the first time this year, and hoping i can have a quarter of the success you had.  Good job guys!"
267453,lucabrasi,2008-11-14 19:04:00,114,Congrats!! A nice day out there. Had today on my mind as well if not for some morning chores....Gonna be hitting the east mon & tues if there's any left by then. Great Job guys!!!
267454,BillM,2008-11-14 19:06:00,17367,"Screw Gbay tribs this weekend, I am heading east.  Great report Cliff!!!!!"

267466,kemper,2008-11-14 19:35:00,2232,"Awesome guys.  I keep telling myself I am here at school so I can get a wicked job and make the money to live on a river somewhere and slam steel all day but...  DAMMMM  this is killing me, I have been watching the weather all week knowing that if I were at home I would be SLAMMING steel right now.  I hate you  sincerely,  Brady"
267467,highdrifter,2008-11-14 19:42:00,2534,What?!  No night fishing?!  Very sweet.  cheers HD
267470,douG,2008-11-14 19:48:00,2693,"Congratulations, Cliff and Carole!  Great stuff."
267475,jdmls,2008-11-14 20:04:00,575,nice fish CLIFF .. I am suprisedwe didn't run into each other... Today was unreal
267476,fishnsled,2008-11-14 20:04:00,3520,"What a day!!!    Congrats to you both!  Maybe we should hit the tribs instead of musky fishing Carole?  Na, you need a musky to brag about all winter long to your hubby."
267481,bigugli,2008-11-14 20:12:00,6138,What a wonderful day you both had. Those are some fine looking fish.
267482,snag,2008-11-14 20:12:00,1932,You two are fishing machines. Well oiled  Amazing!
267486,jwl,2008-11-14 20:19:00,1056,"nice mess of fish there, looks like a pretty action packed fun day on the banks"
267574,Leecher,2008-11-15 00:25:00,7832,"Well done Cliff and Carol Great report and pics  Awesome, just awesome Keep those reports coming and thanks for sharing Leechman"
267577,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-15 00:42:00,3761,"again lot's of very nice fish, congrads!"
267594,ehg,2008-11-15 01:27:00,2666,"That is a great pile of fish. Looks like you got out there at the right time. Nice pics as well   Tried to identify the trib by looking at creekbed substrate but i can't tell? lol nice stuff, ehg"
267613,the spirit of fishing,2008-11-15 02:37:00,141,looks like an amazing day-great report; I had planned on hitting the tribs today but couldn't get away from work -all day I thought about what great weather to be out there and now I see your report and boy am I envious; even had I been able to get out I'd never dream of having the day you did
267615,bbnotty,2008-11-15 02:42:00,93,Great job guys
267640,Paulus,2008-11-15 04:32:00,522,Awesome fish and great shots! I'm glad you were able to get out and have such a good day .  Many more to come!  Keep the pictures coming!  p.-
267657,ccmtcanada,2008-11-15 12:32:00,7971," Thanks Anders...I have no idea how big that male was, we didn't measure any of them...and right now I cant even remember...LOL.  A good day for us is one each...we've heard you can have days like this, but never experienced one until yesterday!    There will be plenty left!  With all the rain this weekend your biggest concern will be clarity of water.   I've never fished the GB tribs before...from what I know though, the scenery is much nicer than the east tribs!!   It's ok Brady...we hate you too   The fish will be back every year...you're doing the right thing in school there!   We thought we'd try fishing when you could actually see past 10 feet...it was fun!  haha.    Smarta$$!!!  GOod luck out there....seriously...hope you get at least one follow each....    Yeah...that mud is pretty much everywhere these days...hehe.     We never thought we'd have a day like that either....we just got lucky with the timing and conditions.  Not total luck, I knew what to look for, but this was the first time it actually all came together....still getting to know how each trib responds to rain."
267661,Greencoachdog,2008-11-15 13:37:00,8163,"You two are turning into quite the Steelheaders eh!    ... the faceless, headless, backgoundless pics say it all. Next thing yanno, you'll be displaying them in the seafood section of Sobey's   This Radioactive Brainwave fish will destroy future runs if you didn't kill it!!! They're very tasty with a nice dill sauce!   Please note how the Radioactive Brainwave fish in the first pic has absolutely ruined the fine manicure of the fishing Goddess in this pic!!! Eating said RB fish's ""soul and sins"" will reverse this malady, the dill sauce will hasten the reversal process!   Excellent report Cliff!!!  Glad to see you and bly had such a magnificent day!!!  Days like that are few and far between anywhere, and for any species... and that makes them SUGAR SWEET!!!"
268293,Bly,2008-11-17 02:48:00,1556,  Glen....you are too funny!   Regarding the pictures..I wasn't feeling particularly photogenic and figured most people only want to see the fish anyway.  Promise to post a picture or two very soon with faces  LOL
