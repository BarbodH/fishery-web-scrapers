269023,Dartee,2008-11-18 18:22:00,47,"""Under the new bill, teenage drivers in Ontario would only be allowed one passenger aged 16 to 19 - although there would be exemptions for brothers and sisters. Studies show just one teenage passenger with a teen driver doubles the chances of an accident.""  I agree with most, but the no-passenger thing is a load of ......  If that had been in place back in high school... there never would have been  football or soccer teams. Most kids lived more then a 15-40 min country drive and practices always went passed the ""Late bus"". Everyone car pooled. 1 day 1 person, next day someone else. (gave time for the car/truck to air out before it was your turn again  ).Also saved a load of $ on gas."
268972,kemper,2008-11-18 16:28:00,2232," First point- Definately agree, I have alot of friends (some I wont get in the car with) because they speed like the devil, but I bet you catch a whole lot of 45 year olds going 25-40 Kmph over too?  BAC- I dont have a problem with the 0 BAC for young drivers, mostly because I dont get behind the wheel if I have had even one beer. Its not worth it, why risk your licence or worse your life or someone elses. BUT I still think someone who is older should be punished to the same extent as someone who is younger.  Passengers- That rule is just a complete load of crap. Not logical even in the slightest. As Rick stated earlier I guess if myself and 4 buddies want to head up to Scugog for some nightfishing (which we often do) we have to take 2 cars. That puts two 'inexperienced' drivers on the road. From the Gov's point of view that puts two TERRIBLE drivers on the road, because we never get a chance to prove ourselves. We are just bad drivers until we MAGICALLY turn 21 and all the sudden poof okay you are a good driver now?  GIVE ME A BREAK  FishNautographs, I assume you are a police officer? I have an honest question for you, since you are the one that has to go to the scene of the accidents and chase down the dangerous driver do you think that most young drivers are more dangerous than older drivers? The answer I am guessing is yes, (at least I hope it is yes or I am REALLY getting screwed on my insurance) BUT does it seem to you that we (young drivers) are as much of a danger as the insurance companies and government think we are?  I wont be offended by any answer, I am just trying to figure out why I am not allowed to own a car. Because essentially that is what a $4000 insurance premium does to me. My parents aren't millionaires and didn't buy me a car and pay the insurance for my birthday, nor would I expect them to so what these laws and insurance numbers do to me is ban me from owning a car and keep my off the road."
268973,Cookslav,2008-11-18 16:32:00,1457,"Ya thats a bit much I think?  Young drivers are...well they are young but they have to start somewere. You can't buy expereince. And the graduated licensing already makes it a long drawn out proccess, with some strict rules.  I'd love to see Cellphone banned in ""moving"" cars...that would be a good start IMO. But limiting your passengers is a bit much for me.... I guess my Daughter will never be able to drive my 2 other children to school with her? Or Drive to a sporting event with some team mates? I suppose passengers could be a distaction, but really.... Once your fully licensed are they any less distracting?  So then we end up with fully licensed drivers with zero experience when transporting more then one person? Logic falls off right there... Although I suppose we could ban music in cars as well, and radio shows.... There is no limit.   Thats the truth right there. My wife was rear ended on a clear road, with little traffice by driving instructor....nuff said"
268974,fishing n autograph,2008-11-18 16:38:00,2540," I honestly can't answer that because bad drivers come in all ages, races, and both sexes.....  I wish I could answer that, but in terms of speeders, I think our stats was 85% of 50 overs were under 25....the ones my friends and I have caught are between 17-20 driving moms car and they think its okay doing 110 in a 60...."
268976,chickenhawk,2008-11-18 16:43:00,612,DUUUUUUUUUUUMB!!!!
268977,kemper,2008-11-18 16:44:00,2232,"Its a miracle, bad drivers come in all ages, races and sexes. Who'da thunk it?  Thanks, makes sense and I believe the 50 over thing. Some kids definately have the need for speed but before all the older folks judge us younger ones...I bet you guys went alot faster!   I just wish someone would give me a chance to prove myself thats all. Ive been on the road for three years this December with the cleanest record on the books and I am still dangerous. Just doesnt make sense to me."
268980,fishing n autograph,2008-11-18 16:51:00,2540," Kemper don't worry, I think the majority of us under 30 have gone throught what you're going through.  Remember, when I bought my new car (i was 24)....i paid $312 a month for my car and $308 for the insurance. Keep it up and the problems go away"
268998,LeXXington,2008-11-18 17:35:00,1928,"Much easier too put FOO FOO laws out there than do real work like the economy, tighten the spending etc.  21 for passengers is a little stupid, maybe great for big city with transit but come on.  Oh well you get what you vote for"
269001,Roy,2008-11-18 17:41:00,13728,Can a 20 year old still use the carpool lane to  get to work if he's not allowed to have passengers?
269005,Bernie,2008-11-18 17:55:00,3190,"By the time I hit 21 high school was completed, been employed full time for 4 years, had bought several vehicles(2 of them new) owned a new house and was married. Too many rules and regulations already and often not enforceable or get thrown out of court. Lawyers keep laughing all the way to the bank."
269017,irishfield,2008-11-18 18:08:00,26272,Exactly Bernie and what I was getting at. When our son was born... I was a few weeks short of 21 and Leah was just 19..and we were on our third vehicle. I wouldn't have been able to drive them home under this crap proposal. When our daughter was born... Leah wasn't yet 21 and wouldn't have been able to drive her two children to the mall or the Doctors! Absolute crap. Bad enough kids don't seem to mature quick enough these days... do we need the governments help to delay this process even more?
268880,BUSTER,2008-11-18 11:50:00,1336,"we let them pass the ridiculous street racing thing(its speeding if your alone?) and now they want the cell phone while driving thing, no smoking in your car with your kids? as many have being saying its not the laws that are being made but inch by inch were letting them take our rghts away, your right TJ before long we wond be able to smoke in your own house if you have company over and like irishfield said its all good untill you get a ticket for reading your fish finder while operating a boat or letting your 20 year old son have  1 beer then drive the boat?"
268888,outllaw,2008-11-18 12:15:00,1232,"the inmates are running the insane asylum. or should i re-phrase this. our goverment is in bed with insurance lawyers.. we live in an over litigated country, any arguments????"
268896,holdfast,2008-11-18 12:42:00,1813,Nope
268903,TJQ,2008-11-18 13:02:00,7806,I can go along with the no alcohol... but to me limiting the passengers is ridiculous...
