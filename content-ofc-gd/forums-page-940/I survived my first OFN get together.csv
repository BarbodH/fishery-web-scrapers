268290,tbayboy,2008-11-17 02:43:00,1497,"So last week I get a note from Lexxington  asking if I was interested in sharing a boat and a cottage with him and bassmasterMike.  Freezing weather, big water, fishing styles I don't know (deep trolling) - bring it on I say .  We took off Friday morning and by 2pm had the boat ready for the first trip  <a href=""   title=""The ride by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3015/3036591852_3383a068aa_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""The ride"" /></a>  Friday was absolutely beautiful on the water but putting that cover up would certainly pay off later but Friday we got out to check the locations and I got some lessons on planers, riggers and lead core - thanks Paul.  We didn't get any fish but that was fine - not often you get this in November:  <a href=""   title=""Waiting for a bite by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3023/3036595242_83f185c8f3_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Waiting for a bite"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""The last time we saw the sun by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/3035763797_be5b7d67b3_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""The last time we saw the sun"" /></a>  After pulling back into perfect vue (fine place by the way - nothing super fancy but did the job - no complaints) we put on the pasta and opened up the big bottle of wine  <a href=""   title=""Eating like kings by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3228/3035765629_c4fb2e72fd_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Eating like kings"" /></a>  After polishing that bad boy off we grabbed our beers and headed over to do the rounds of visiting.  It was great to meet everyone and put some names to the board members I've read of over the last few years.  Great bunch of guys all around.  I took some pictures of the gang but they all came out pretty bad - might have had something to do with the way I felt the next morning.  Good times  So obviously we weren't out really early Saturday and the fact that the weather had taken a nose dive didn't exactly make us rush .  Boy did I learn to appreciate boat covers - Paul I love your boat.  Once we did get out we dropped back the lines and had just sat down to get comfy when Mike's rod went off.  After a succesful planar board release Mike had our first of the weekend, a nice 6 pounder:  <a href=""   title=""Surgery by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3026/3035770659_d600938f45_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Surgery"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""First fish by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/3036607834_a7b27b12eb_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""First fish"" /></a>  Here's a recap of the next 8 hours:  <a href=""   title=""Rain and more rain by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3046/3036610738_afa999b56c_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Rain and more rain"" /></a>  As the end of the day came Paul made one last change - a spoon back all the way on the lead core line and shortly after the line just stopped.  This was a no doubter and took Paul a while to bring in all the time wondering if it was a record sheepie or the worlds biggest perch but eventually he got a good luck and the grin went ear to ear.  The gut on this guy looked like it was just about to pop it was so big:  <a href=""   title=""Quinte Gold by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3226/3035784801_40b2ffa4d8_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Quinte Gold"" /></a>  The scales bounced a bit as this girl was still full of fight - bounced anywhere from high 12 to mid thirteen, here's my pic showing 13 11  <a href=""   title=""The proof by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3276/3036613088_98cdcb42d2.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""The proof"" /></a>  Congrats to Paul on a real beauty and my first up close look at the famous Quinte walleye I've heard so much about.  After that we tried to duplicate the luck as we started to see lots of active fish coming up to look at the cannon balls but it was getting dark so we headed back - great way to end the day.  <a href=""   title=""Sunset by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3228/3036626812_d481a1694a_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""337"" alt=""Sunset"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/3035788103/"" title=""Sunset day 2 by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3272/3035788103_a49a395e00_b.jpg"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" alt=""Sunset day 2"" /></a>  Today we wanted to give it a bit of a try before heading back to town.  How bad could the weather be?  ummmm.....  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/3035788473/"" title=""This is fun? by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3057/3035788473_732bf4a9f9_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""This is fun?"" /></a>  Took us three spots to find a launch we felt safe using but we gave it a shot for 4 hours but didn't get anything.  We were all huddled up under the cover with the mr. heater on full - have I mentioned how much I love Pauls boat cover?  So that's my first GTG report - no fish but a fun time so thats ok, only 6 months til the opener right?"

268458,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-17 16:13:00,1362, Wow...the luck of the Irish to have a metal coat hanger and in the truck to boot!!...It's been years since I've seen those metals ones...the wife threw them all out and replaced them with plastic ones  Regarding the hands gettin' numb thing Wayne...is that because of old age or the cold???
