268232,Rizzo,2008-11-17 01:06:00,4754,"I swear someone will catch a fish this year when we get together on the 13th... and I'm doing my best to make sure its me. I went out on the river for the first time this year this past Saturday. Man what a nasty day. Rained a good part of the day but luckily almost no wind, and air temps were reasonable too. Clarity was good but not TOO good (like the river can be some times). I'd say 8-10 feet visibility in most areas. Water was 50 degrees. We launched at Netherby and booted up to Frenchman's then started a zig zag troll back downstream. Other than smacking bottom real good a few times we got diddly on the first trip down the river. We decided to troll upstream rather than down a bit later in the day and this produced 2 small muskies (both around 6-7 lbs). A third small fish (similar size) was caught after I stopped the boat from trolling..fish hit as I was reeling in to check the lure for weeds/zebra mussels. Nothing big, but at least we saw that there are some fish there! We also tried a bit of casting (one follow) and jigging (couple of snags) but had no luck. Trolling seemed to be the choice that day. No photos were taken and 2 of the three fish didn't even leave the water, just a quick release at boatside. Third fish we needed to cut a hook that went through its cheek so it came on board for about 5 seconds."

268238,Leecher,2008-11-17 01:23:00,7832,"Great report Rizzo  Was real wet in my area Saturday and got skunked You did good, congratulation Thanks for sharing Leechman"
268251,Rizzo,2008-11-17 01:39:00,4754," Easier to pose with too I guess! You're right though, the little ones do have great markings"
268382,tinbanger,2008-11-17 13:20:00,1028,Rizzo Think you just answered my question about launches and locations thanks TB
268409,muskeybugged,2008-11-17 14:29:00,282,"""fish hit as I was reeling in to check the lure for weeds/zebra mussels.""  Nice report..... after bouncing bottom last weekend and hooking into a couple plump muscles, I left them hooked and what do you know 5 mins later..... A PB for me  no big deal only my second ski. Still a PB to be broken next year!"
268424,lew,2008-11-17 14:54:00,12767,"Roger, did you launch at the marina where we always go , and if so, did you see any signs indicating the ramp will be closed in December for the g2g ??"
268428,tinbanger,2008-11-17 15:02:00,1028,"Rizzo  Frenchmans bay ? How far up the river , where the river splits at Grand Island ?  TB"
268430,Bly,2008-11-17 15:05:00,1556,Nice report Rizzo   Best of luck for the G2G!
268479,Squid,2008-11-17 17:14:00,1656,"Nice job buddy, can't wait for the G2G. I plan on fishing the buffalo harbor a few more times so if anyone has a NY state lincense, and wants to fish for muskies, and has their own gear, you are welcome to join me. Just send me a PM."
268488,Rizzo,2008-11-17 17:43:00,4754,"Hi Lew, We launched at Netherby but I did notice about 8 vehicles/trailers parked at the marina, so the marina was still open last week-end, not sure if the same will be true a month from now."
268493,jwl,2008-11-17 18:10:00,1056," Rizzo,the launch happened to be open Saturday because there was a local BASS club tourney going on, they had permission to use the ramp, hence the boat trailers there, to the best I know of, It was getting locked back up sometime right after the tourney.   Hope that gives a bit of insight"
268651,ehg,2008-11-17 23:53:00,2666,"Wow that's not bad fishing especially on the Upper Niagara. Bodes well for the future! Was under the impression that there was no muskies in the Upper Niagara, before reading this here post."
268700,Joey,2008-11-18 00:56:00,9122,Good stuff Roger.  Hoping to make the G2G this year also.  Save a few for us for then okay  Joey
268769,snag,2008-11-18 02:35:00,1932,"I'm sorry,  I've read your report twice and can't seem to find a reasonable excuse for no camera/pics.  Sure it's a great read and no doubt on your catches,  But...   We would just like to see more pics of you,  That's all. "
268913,Fishmaster,2008-11-18 13:54:00,920,No Muskie in the Niagara ??? the Niagara can be world class for Muskie ...get out there and try you never know what just might hit those lures ...
268970,jwl,2008-11-18 16:18:00,1056,"there's no fish in that river, I don't even know why I have fished it for almost 30 years"
269029,Rizzo,2008-11-18 18:35:00,4754," snag, you're making me very nervous"

269053,highdrifter,2008-11-18 19:45:00,2534, All that time pushing a pencil has finally made you reach break point.  Textbook homocidal skunkenstein..    HD
269080,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-18 20:49:00,2050," yeah man - I'm no muskie fisherman, but I was bassin' in a marina in the upper niagara last summer and we must have seen a half dozen or more ski's hanging around in the boat docks that day.  Mostly smaller ones, but a couple brutes to!  Thanks for the report Rizzo!  Cheers, UF"
