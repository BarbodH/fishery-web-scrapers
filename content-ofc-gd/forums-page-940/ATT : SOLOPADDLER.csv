268814,solopaddler,2008-11-18 03:22:00,8605,"It's been a crazy day bro, lot's of stuff going on. On the way home yesterday my family was stopped at a red light and rammed from behind at 60km an hour. They're okay thank God, but were shaken... A lot of Bull today with the kids father, insurance, police etc., etc., etc....  Anyway I'll try and throw a report up tomorrow. It was a stellar trip  ."
268818,kemper,2008-11-18 03:26:00,2232,"hope you and yours are all OK Mike, I would say thats a good enough excuse for the delay on the report, and there arent too many good excuses!  all the best   kemper"
268824,silvio,2008-11-18 03:33:00,433,Solo good to know the family is ok. Cant wait to see the report always look forward to them.
268826,irishfield,2008-11-18 03:35:00,26272,Mike... get them all into a Doctor. Whiplash has a way of popping up a day or two later...and many times severe brusing/issues from the seatbelt when thrown forward.
268829,Bernie,2008-11-18 03:37:00,3190,I agree with Wayne. My wife suffered with it for many years afterward. She also didn't notice it right away.
268830,jdmls,2008-11-18 03:38:00,575,"Wow, good to hear you guys are ok  .... I hear you bud, there's nothin worse than dealing with accidents & insurance claims... Us steelhead folk can wait another day in suspense I guess"
268832,solopaddler,2008-11-18 03:41:00,8605, Already did that Wayne. Seemed the smart thing to do when Jo woke up this morning with a sore back and my daughter complained her neck hurt... My son's only 2 and not talking yet. In any case there appears to be no serious injuries but as you say you never know..
268857,sonny,2008-11-18 04:55:00,511,"Take your yime,,i can imagine it is a very stressfull time for you,,,glad to hear everyone is ok!"
268891,ccmtcanada,2008-11-18 12:31:00,7971,Oh man...hope everyone is ok Mike!!!  Take care of them first...the report can wait.
268893,chickenhawk,2008-11-18 12:38:00,612,good to hear every1 is okay....can't wait for the report!!!   Hawk
268906,bigugli,2008-11-18 13:25:00,6138,"Glad to hear all is O.K.  The son got in the same mess a month ago.  Rear ended at the stop lightand was also lucky to avoid real injury, but the shoulder locked up 2 days later. The injuries can take up to 72 hours to show themselves.  Take care of your family first. Us yahoos can wait.  You'l probably spend 2 weeks playing games with the adjusters before all is settled."
268909,troutologist,2008-11-18 13:44:00,951,Hope the family is alright Mike.  Best wishes!
268917,wuchikubo,2008-11-18 14:00:00,1114,I hope all is well with the family Mike. I really like reading your reports but family should always come first. I'll wait for your report and wishing your family an uncomplicated recovery.  Stan
268963,fishing n autograph,2008-11-18 16:06:00,2540,"yeah, soft tissue sets in 24-48 hours...i'd agree to send them to a doctor first....my buddy got t boned and 3 days later he locked up...  I'm glad everyone is okay."
269030,ehg,2008-11-18 18:35:00,2666,"Thank goodness your wife and beautiful children are alright! Puts things in perspective. Your a good and lucky man Mike.  Thanks for the great reports you have done, obviously the next one will have to wait. ehg"
