Yeah I kept it and 23 pounds was the taxidermists scale. Take it for what it is.  For reference: Here's a 38.75 incher that weighed 15.3 pounds caught this year.  "

I was trapping minnows for a night fishin trip and decided to bring the float rod and try to bother some resident bows, this river has some nice ones and here is what I found in a deep hole in Mid August. Boy was she upset with me!    Not sure on the measurements, but she was big.  My actual PB chinny was caught on a charter in the Juan de Fuca (sp) strait a couple summers ago off Van. island on a charter. What  a blast!"

267138,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-13 19:28:00,2050," Ok, so every time somebody sais ""WOW, I'd like to catch an X length fish"" I have to first do a background check to see if they're being serious or sarcastic.  And, "" I have to know who and what I'm talking about"".  Are you kidding me?  This is the INTERNET... sorry I don't spend enough time on here to know the who's - who of OFC.  And you didn't have to spell it out Dad.  As if I'd try to tell Lew how to catch a ski, or Solo how to catch steelhead.... He made a comment, and I figured I'd take a few seconds out of my day to pitch in some advice.  You don't see Solopaddler making sarcastic comments about somebodies 15"" shaker just because he's caught a million of them that are bigger.....  Anyways, I don't normally let myself get caught up in arguments online, it's the reason why people are sometimes reluctant to join the board, and %99 of the time this is a great place to be.  I'm sorry for being ignorant and not knowing that Tenguy laughs at the thought of catching 34"" gators.  Cheers, UF"
267139,lew,2008-11-13 19:30:00,12767,"Well, I've never really been one to measure or weigh fish, 'cept for bigger muskies, so I can't really offer too much to this thread, but this is a nice Largemouth I got a few years back. I always carried a couple scales in the boat for anybody that wanted to weigh something and seeing as this girl was my biggest bass ever, I weighed her on both scales to be sure.  It came in at 7 pounds 14 oz. on the spring scale and 8 pounds 2 oz. on a digital so we split the difference and called it an even 8 pounds.    Never took a measurement or weight  on a pickeral or pike either so I'll offer up this nice 54 1/2"" musky from a couple years ago, which by the way, I'm hoping to top this weekend on Lake St. Clair  "

Walleye- Biggest measured was 24"" but I think I beat it this summer with no measurement. Lake Scugog, from shore on a minnow under a float.  Small Mouth- 22"", Never got a weight but I figure it was getting close to 5 lbs. That said, dad got a 23.5"" that was only 4lbs 7oz once. Skinny bugger.  Steelhead- Ill look for the pic, it was a monster but I did not get an official weight OR measurement. All I have for a guide was the 24"" handle on my rod, and the steelie DWARFS it. Monster male out of Eastern Trib in March 2008. Solo trip.    Found it!  That was an unreal trip, broke my PB twice.  I also got a big male this spring but was all spawned out and had no meat on him. Would have been a monster in March."
