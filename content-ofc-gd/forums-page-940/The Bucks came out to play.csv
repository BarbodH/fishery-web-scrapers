269140,buckster,2008-11-18 23:11:00,530,"  Ouch is right lol   Just for an update,  i dropped off the deer to the butcher about an hour ago and the head to the taxidermist at 330.   I will post the mount when i get it back  My dad is still on cloud 9.   The guy at the taxidermy shop said that it was the biggest body he has seen this year!  Now its my turn"
269144,misfish,2008-11-18 23:15:00,29133, Who did you use?
268086,buckster,2008-11-16 18:24:00,530,"The day started at 5am waiting for meely to show up.  All night i had a serious itch with the snow in the forecast.  We made our way out to the stands at about 6am.  At about 7 i look out into the field and spot about 8 deer feeding.  One of these 8 deer was a monster buck and boy was he after them does.  I was watching this buck for about half hour before it made it way back into the bush.  I figured that was it.  I let out a few grunts, about 15-20 mins later this huge buck was on the fence line behind me.  Here he comes im saying to myself.  60 yard then 50 then 30.  All of a sudden this deer just held up right behind me.  It was just standing there right behind me for 10 mins and i couldnt turn around to let my excalibur fly.  This was a buck of a lifetime.  He had other things in mind and back out into the field he went, to tend to those hot does............ I guess he didnt like  the flavor of tinks i was using lol.  My hope was gone as most of the deer went back into the bush.  I call meely on the radio and he saw the beast also.  We decide to do some calling and we can hear a buck grunting back to us.   5 mins later we hear my dads crossbow go off.  I knew the deer he shot at wasnt the big buck and right after he shot i saw a deer running between me and my dad.  I knew this deer wasnt hit and i thought my dad missed.  So when we all met up at my dads stand we came to discover that there were indeed 2 deer and the deer my dad shot at just walked away.  He thought it was a miss as did i.  After doing some tracking we found the arrow, RED..... Good sign.   Then we follow the tracks in the snow and more good blood.  My dad said it was a small buck................ until we found it.....but does this 8 point look small to u?  look at the snow misfish i knew u weren't telling a lie lol  look at that neck......... sorry about the blood"
