268803,Badger Shark,2008-11-18 03:09:00,291,Now we are definitely heading down Wednesday and again on Sat.  I really hope they are biting half as much as they were this past Sat.
267957,Badger Shark,2008-11-16 06:20:00,291,"We decided to head to Quinte today instead of Sunday due to the forcast weather and boy are we ever glad we did.  Picked up Eric at 5am headed to Terrys' and then met Sheldon at 6am and headed to the bay.  Once again we had the privilage to join Sheldon for the day in his boat due to clients cancelling, they really should have gone out!  Hit the water around 8:30am and quickly got set up with an eight rod spread!  Man this is really an advantage.  Anyway to make a long story short we had our best day on Quinte so far.  We went 16 for 19, and all quality fish.  So here is a bunch of fish porn, hope you enjoy, what a fun day and  we also had 3 double headers.                                               Cant wait till the next outing,  Once again thank you very much Sheldon for giving us the privilage of joining you for the day, it was a blast and it was nice to see you relaxed and having fun and actually gedtting to catch fish!"

268038,BUSTER,2008-11-16 15:33:00,1336,you know that sound a ruler makes when you hang it off the end of the desk and flick it!
268116,jdmls,2008-11-16 19:21:00,575,serious numbers man !!....It's funny how being soaking wet and freezing cold has no effect when your hitting fish one after another !!!
268124,Badger Shark,2008-11-16 19:45:00,291,  We heard alot of chatter over the radio and guys were getting fish.  Where we were we counted 25 boats around us.  Fishindevil and the guys he was with pulled up close to us just as we hit our 3rd double header!  Hope everyone did well.  Man the rain was a bit of a pain again but to tell you the truth I like fishing out there when the winds are not high and its cloudy rainy and at least somewhat mild.    At least yesterday!
268127,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-16 20:00:00,3761,Congrads guys you all did good!

268351,eye-tracker,2008-11-17 12:11:00,89,"Was a great day out on the water, lots of chatter on the radio but it sounded like many where fishing 50 feet down. A majority of our big fish came high with reef runner 800s only 45 and 75 feet behind the boards.  -sheldon"
