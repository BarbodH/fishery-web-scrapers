Mark Kulik for giving me so much help any time i needed it (now I am addicted to drop shotting) Hirk (thanks for all the boat advice) Slayinm for always answering questions being the neighbour across the lake and sharing tactics unselfishly. I am missing a bunch of you for sure, and hope to see some of you on the ice"
