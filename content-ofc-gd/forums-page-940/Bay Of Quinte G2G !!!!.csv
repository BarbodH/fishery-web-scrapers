268997,fishindevil,2008-11-18 17:29:00,6254,"Thanks everyone,for the great replys,it was all possible because of dan !!  a.ka.[percher] a.k.a [34.72] he kept us on fish,and it was hard work,he figures we did almost 100 miles in 3 days of fishing,we covered tons of water,in all conditions 3,4,and even the odd 5ft waves, and never even for a minuite did we give up !!!!"
268270,fishindevil,2008-11-17 02:17:00,6254,"Well percher,slowpoke & myself all went to the bay of quinte g2g for 3 days of some harcore walleye fishing !!!! and the walleyes,sure did come out to play !!!! we all fished out of dans boat and we all caught lots of big fish,and had a great time,i want to thank dan for letting my fish out of his new lund,and for getting on fish the whole time !!!! thanks bud,well here goes some serious fish porn,with my biggest walleye of the trip just under13lbs,i think it was 12.7lbs,and all the rest of my fish were between 8-12 lbs,all were taken on manns & tail dancers off the in-line boards,the weather down there was all over the place with thursday being the worse with 6ft waves and windy,friday was windy as well but not too bad,then saturday in the pouring rain all day,but no wind,and that was the best day for the big fish !!!! with all my walleyes caught on saturday,as for the first 2 days i was handed the big skunk,but i stuck with using my in-lines,and with the program i was running and it payed off big time !!! with 3 out of 5 walleyes comming in over the 10lb mark it was great to fish with rob-memar on friday too,and everyone had a blast and i hope to get a few more trips down to quinte before the ice comes,so enjoy the walleye porn,as im sure brian & dan will have a report & pics too !!!!

268309,douG,2008-11-17 03:21:00,2693,Great to hear of a successful BoQ for the OFC crew.  That first walleye is a brute.
268310,Mike the Pike,2008-11-17 03:22:00,3421,Very nice fish Sean!  After 2 days of the Skunk what a great pack of walleyes to make up for 2 dissapointing days.  Your snoring sounds like my chainsaw and I know mine is not much better  Good luck on the next outing.  MTP
268316,Bernie,2008-11-17 03:30:00,3190,I am never going to a BOQ get together. It would spoil me for life  Wowee . Nice fish Sean!   I will never catch a walleye like those in Nipissing.
268325,Badger Shark,2008-11-17 04:01:00,291,The bite definitely was on and hopefully it will be next week.  Finally what we have worked so hard for.

268346,Roy,2008-11-17 11:50:00,13728,Heavy duty report there Shawn! You got some really nice fish there. Congrats to you.

268348,solopaddler,2008-11-17 11:57:00,8605,"WTG Shawn, some trophy fish there. Almost makes me want to put the float rod down  ."

268354,wgk36,2008-11-17 12:25:00,69,"nice report Shawn, and excellent pics.  I had a great weekend with you and the guys.  Looking forward to next year."
268360,b2kptbo,2008-11-17 12:40:00,1505,"Beauty rewards for time put in, sure are some nice ones..."
268370,lew,2008-11-17 13:00:00,12767,"Incredible weekend Shawn, congrats, but with the time and effort you put into Quinte you deserve all the good fortune that comes your way."
268413,forrest,2008-11-17 14:39:00,1032,Thats the 2nd day this November you have had a huge hall of fish.  Good stuff!  6ft waves .  Were you guys fishing in 6ft waves or did you head for calmer water? Does anyone know what do 6ft waves do for lure action?  forrest
268416,fishindevil,2008-11-17 14:46:00,6254,"Well forrest on thursday near the upper gap where we were fishing it was just brutal,and the winds were gusting to almost 70kph,and boat control was very difficult,but dan made it happen,and you really have to watch your lines & boardstoo as seeing a fish hit the boards is almost impossible,there was even a tree fell down right beside the next cabin where we were staying at perfect view !!!!you have to really know what you are doing in bad weather like that,and have a floater suit on as well,you sure get extra lure action from the waves thats for sure,quinte is big water,and demands full respect,but we are die-hard walleye guys and thats what you have be ready for at the bay of quinte !!!!"
268418,PERCHER,2008-11-17 14:48:00,787,Shawn I had a blast.That was one of our best trips ever.You and Brian are welcome in my boat ANY TIME. Thanks for posting your pic's .I will try to get mine up soon.See ya soon. Dan
268423,tbayboy,2008-11-17 14:54:00,1497,"Was great meeting you at the GTG Shawn - some great fish there, well deserved buy  a bunch of guys that sure put in the effort.  Congrats!"
268463,SlowPoke,2008-11-17 16:25:00,2984,They could run but they couldn't hide from you Shawn! I think CONFIDENCE is what got you into those fish. You were so confident in your Friday lure selection that you left the rest of your tackle in the truck on Saturday!  I had a good time out there and we'll do it again. -Brian
268559,Terry,2008-11-17 21:25:00,14456,nice going some nice fish there
268575,NAC,2008-11-17 21:47:00,369,"Wow! If I only ever have one walleye report, than that is how I would want it to look....  actually just any one of those fish would be sufficient.  great fishing!"
