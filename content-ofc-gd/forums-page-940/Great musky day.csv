A nice fish and strong fighter considering the cold water temperatures only 5 minutes into the game.     What followed was nothing short of outstanding! Three fish in 30 minutes! The wind was blowing hard and the waves rolled and rolled while the mukies had a ball with our lures!  This fish attracted some attention from local wildlife,  The bird is really 3 or 4 feet away. This bird would not leave us alone. Anyway, continuing with the fish,    Alright, you are probably wondering what is so outstanding about these 30 minutes? Well the next fish got the adrenaline going, from the scream of the clicker on the reel when she hit to when she first came up to the surface by the boat and finally hoisting her out of the net. We could not feel the cold during this one.. ok enough reading, here is the main course!   It's unfortunate that in this case the pictures do not give, this horse of a fish, justice. Because this is the heaviest fish hands down, of the season...    so far!     I just hope the weather lets us fish for another 2-3 weeks before the ice takes over."
