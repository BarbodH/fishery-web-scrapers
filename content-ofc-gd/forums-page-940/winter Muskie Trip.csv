Hav enever fished the river before.  Also if anyone is interested will be planning the trip for this thursday , leaving from Barrie around 6 am ( weather dependant!) and staying till around 4 pm  TB"
268383,lew,2008-11-17 13:20:00,12767,"Dave, take the QEW past Niagara Falls towards Fort Erie and watch for Netherby Rd as you get close to town. Take the cutoff and turn left at the stop sign and go over the QEW for about 1 mile and you'll come to the river. Turn right and follow the river several miles towards Fort Erie and you'll come to a marina with a good concrete ramp.  There's a possibility it may be closed for the season and if so, just continue for another short distance and you'll come to another ramp at Frenchmens Creek. Not as good, but definetely OK.  Don't forget the musky gtg on December 13th, hope you can join us."

268408,lew,2008-11-17 14:27:00,12767,"Just a heads up Dave seeing as your not familiar with the river.  If you use that ramp I mentioned, you'll be quite aways above the Falls but there'll still be a bit of a current, but if you head towards Lake Erie, the current gets stronger the closer you get and when you pass under the Peace Bridge it can get very strong at times, although you won't have a problem in your boat.  We were in an 18' walleye boat a couple years back when the water boiled up under us near the railway bridge and spun us 180 degrees.....made for an interesting few moments"
268426,tinbanger,2008-11-17 14:57:00,1028,"certainly been thinkin if its wise to venture out on unknown river water this time of year solo, but a little adventure can make life interesting . Plan on trolling upstream from the launch area , more of a exploratory trip really  TB"
268482,jwl,2008-11-17 17:19:00,1056,"Just so you guys know, the marina launch is closed..since it's not the ""Park's marina"" anymore, they have locked it up after the off season started.  There are other launches along the way dotted all along the parkway..as for baits...right now try stuff that looks like a rainbow trout   you can troll a couple areas no probs and get a bit of a dig into the bottom, you can also just try and drift/jig some plastics like Storms on the bottom, or big jigs.  Try fishing the drop offs near some of the creek mouths, and that big sand/mud flat near the Marina"
