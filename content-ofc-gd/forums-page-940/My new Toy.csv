268762,bigugli,2008-11-18 02:28:00,6138,I do like the Polar Express backpack. Just had to reinforce some of the stitching.
268766,medmart,2008-11-18 02:33:00,587,I got one of those when there is no snow on the ice it blows away now i use it to collect dust  Rob
268776,danbo,2008-11-18 02:41:00,2646,Dang I would've bought yours then!
268807,Fang,2008-11-18 03:15:00,1330,I saw one of those blowing across Cooks bay last year. Fasten it down good or tie it to your leg Danbo
268808,irishfield,2008-11-18 03:16:00,26272,Jesse enjoyed the shelter of her's last year in the middle of Temagami.  
268819,danbo,2008-11-18 03:29:00,2646,Thanx for the advice y'all!
268887,Greencoachdog,2008-11-18 12:09:00,8163,Does this mean you're actually gonna go fishin' or something???
268933,bicephalic,2008-11-18 14:31:00,112, Oh sure - give her ANOTHER advantage over everyone else...
268989,Pachone,2008-11-18 17:10:00,276,hmmm these are cool. how much are these? where can i research more?

269042,crappieperchhunter,2008-11-18 19:01:00,2582,Looks like a nice portable windbreak. I gotta Fish trap pro... which is perfect for the fishing I do. So I would have no use for the windbreak...but I'm sure some folks will find them handy. Good price too IMHO.
269079,johnnyb,2008-11-18 20:40:00,3413,"I hemmed and hawed over the windbreak, and it was some of the best money I ever spent.  True, it will catch the wind if you're not in it...but if your attentive, it's not a big deal.  Either fold it down quickly when leaving it behind, or take a few minutes to anchor it in.  The metal legs dig into the ice pretty good....my only regret was not buying two, because as you can see above, the wife uses it more than I do! You can sit in that thing and not even realize what the weather is doing...especially if  you're lucky enough to be facing the sun, but have your back to the wind...it's surprisingly useful. Also great for sneaking up on whoever's in it and dangling fresh bait in their face...which I have video footage of...but don't know how to post"
269083,bicephalic,2008-11-18 20:53:00,112,Now THAT I've got to see!
269084,johnnyb,2008-11-18 20:54:00,3413,"check the facebook videos, 'cuz"
269089,misfish,2008-11-18 21:16:00,29133,"For the dollar,I would say HT has a very good product. I like the fact they use heavy matrial and it,s BLACK. Attracks the heat. The polar exprees I owned was very good,but found it to be small when in it with the suit on. A two man is really a comfortable one man.   You come up here Dan and we,ll show him.LOL"
269093,jwl,2008-11-18 21:35:00,1056,"might be a pain in the   dragging the picinic table out there with you though, so it doesn't hurt your back setting it up"
269188,mukluk,2008-11-19 00:46:00,196,Priceless jwl!   lmao
269190,Wild,2008-11-19 00:52:00,704,Geeze Dan I hope you ordered the extra large super sized version!
269197,danbo,2008-11-19 01:08:00,2646,XXXL should do!
