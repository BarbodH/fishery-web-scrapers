268722,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-18 01:36:00,3761,"WOW, and here i thought i had alot of tackle. WTG guys it looked like a blast!"
268729,bassmastermike,2008-11-18 01:44:00,295,Hey Wayne Great Report !! It was nice to see you and Terry and Dano again its always a pleasure and thanks again for your help at the Launch! LOL  Hey i also think those   holes must have been Ossama bin fishing and hastymart!!! LMAO
268731,Dano,2008-11-18 01:46:00,719,"Sheesh Wayne, want some cheese with that...ok, ok heres some more pics of the ones you didnt miss.....        Here is the real culprit, not only did he catch the biggest, he took the longest to do it! lol          Seriously though, it was great to get together with everyone again, if anyone gets a chance to fish with these characters, jump at it. I also had a lot of fun visiting everyone at The Perfect View as well, and I guess Terry has officially lost his ""sheepshead"" moniker and has handed it down to ""Mike the sheepshead""   ."
268733,irishfield,2008-11-18 01:47:00,26272,LOL Mike... there was some funny talk on the radio for sure !
268750,bigugli,2008-11-18 02:08:00,6138,I am just green with envy. WTG to you fellows and everybody else that went out to the BOQ on the weekend.
268754,snag,2008-11-18 02:11:00,1932,"Amazing,  I think you made the right call on musky vs. eyes. "
268768,Bly,2008-11-18 02:34:00,1556,"Excellent!!  Love seeing all those pictures of walleye and happy faces!!   Terry, so happy to hear that the sheepies left you alone this year!!"
268774,LeXXington,2008-11-18 02:40:00,1928,Great going Guys..  Good too see all of you again and talk to Loyd that man knows fishing BOQ. (and coat hangers   )  Thanks again
268794,Moosebunk,2008-11-18 02:51:00,3970,Loved it fellas.  That boat is mint for the daytime napper for sure.    Chuck any weather at ya and it's still a garunteed good time.  Thanks for the report Wayne.  Enjoyed that.  Nice fishing boys.
268837,Mike the Pike,2008-11-18 03:52:00,3421,Excellent report Wayne looks like you boyz had some laughs.  Thanks for taking that pic of me not too often I get to see my boat up on plane.  As for the Darth Vader mask worth every penny it kept me warm and I did not feel any stinging rain saturday when running flat out.When I was with Percher (I mean 34.72)the rain really hurts the face at 40 plusMPH.  Dano(Buddy Holly  ) you sleep too much .Terry congrats no stinking sheepy this year.2 of them found there way into my boat.  Gettin up early does pay off
268841,douG,2008-11-18 04:03:00,2693,"Great, Wayne, sorry I couldn't make the Fall Classic this year, makes me 4 for 5.  Your report says that this trip was the one not to miss.  Congratulations to you, Terry and Dano on a great weekend."
268876,Marc Thorpe,2008-11-18 11:18:00,621,"looks like you guys had a blast I see R&R resting up quite a bit,must have recked em before leaving,he looks tuckered out  Good on you guys"
268878,b2kptbo,2008-11-18 11:46:00,1505,"Gotta love it, you boys having a blast, catching lots a good fish, a comfortable floating tackle store... BEAUTIES..."
268902,tinbanger,2008-11-18 12:58:00,1028,with that new boat and all that gear you think Lloyd would be grinning ear to ear .LOL  Excellent report  TB
268915,Headhunter,2008-11-18 13:58:00,5703,"Nice pics and reports boys! Apparently we will allow just about anyone into our cottage!!!!! Gonna have talk to the lads about that! Terry, you can now officially pass the sheepy torch to MTP! HH"
268929,wuchikubo,2008-11-18 14:28:00,1114,"Great report Wayne, those were some nice BOQ hogs. Looks like you all had a great time out there."
268947,tonyb,2008-11-18 15:18:00,1637,"Excellent fishing gents! Some real solid fish in the mix, and nice to get some eater size too! Did the perch make it to the table, it was a fatty!  Nothing better than sharing trips like you guys do, it just doesn't make sense to tow over long distances when you can use each others boats in each location.  So any time you want to fish down this way Wayne, your're welcome to join me, but then you'll have to prove to me that there are fish in Temagami! LOL  Gotta love Quinte!"
268999,fishindevil,2008-11-18 17:40:00,6254,"Aweome fishin report/trip wayne !!!!.  ....you guys all caught some very nice eyes,and lloyd sure has the bay all figured out too,glad to see lots of fish caught and everyone had fun.great pics too thanks for sharing wayne,i think you guys caught the most fish of the whole trip 16/18 all i can say is WOW !!!! cheers"

269110,huntervasili,2008-11-18 22:15:00,1604,"Great report, looks like you four had a great time on the water. Glad to see you were successful in catching fish and in having a great time."
269153,Mike the Pike,2008-11-18 23:40:00,3421, Hey Joe I was also passed the Walleye torch too
269176,fishhunter,2008-11-19 00:30:00,604,"It was a blast meting you all.   As for my boat, I could not think of a better way to end my charter season then fishing 3 days with 3 great friends!!!   Look so forward to seeing you on the ice in Feb for our winter trip Wayne Dan Terry.

268655,Bernie,2008-11-17 23:57:00,3190,Well done you guys.   It's not hard to tell you fellas have a lot of fun together.
268660,Terry,2008-11-18 00:01:00,14456,"Jet, it was good to meet you too"
268662,Badger Shark,2008-11-18 00:03:00,291,"We saw you guys out there on Sat. up near the lighthouse in Adolphus.  We had our best day on Quinte this year with 16 of 19 boated. Did notice several resident eyes caught and it looks like you got a few of those too.  Nice catches guys, I am heading down on Wednesday and again Sat.  Looks like we will have to break ice!"
268670,ccmtcanada,2008-11-18 00:11:00,7971,Glad to see ppl with fish this year at Quinte!!! Excellent report Wayne...looked like you guys had a blast out there this year.  I was going to post no pictures no believe for your fish until I scrolled down and saw them....LOL.  Some real BIG walleye this year guys....great stuff!
268674,irishfield,2008-11-18 00:15:00,26272,"Badger.. the only two fish that came from beyond the Ferry are the pics of Terry and Dan's fish in the heavy rain Saturday afternoon. All the other fish were caught in ""one line land"". We saw Sheldon's boat.. didn't know you were on it."
268681,lew,2008-11-18 00:20:00,12767,"Thanks for that Wayne, best fish'n tale I've read in awhile."
268682,misfish,2008-11-18 00:20:00,29133,  Im not pleased from what I have been told.
268683,irishfield,2008-11-18 00:24:00,26272, Sorry that I forgot your handle jet (that we met at the Ganny Fish clean station).
268689,Joey,2008-11-18 00:35:00,9122,Super report Wayne.  Looks like you guys had a great time together once again.  Great pictures  Joey
268690,Leecher,2008-11-18 00:38:00,7832,Great report and pics Wayne  Man those eyes are huge     Good quality fishing with great company..... can't get better than that  Thanks for sharing Leechman

268701,irishfield,2008-11-18 00:57:00,26272,Yep a great shot Terry... and yes I took it on your camera. A few fish I missed taking on my camera... and many of mine are on yours and Dan's camera only. No point delaying the release of these fine fish for extra shots....... which brings me to another beef from this weekend.  The   holes we saw dancing/hooting and hawlering that they caught a big fish... high fives... 20 pictures and then a gill hold triple summersault throw release back to the lake. Appalling..... some of the same lot that can't get the concept of trolling in the same direction as well...
268711,misfish,2008-11-18 01:10:00,29133, Was circus o lay on this weekend?
