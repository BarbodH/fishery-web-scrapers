268822,PERCHER,2008-11-18 03:32:00,787,"As you know Fishndevil Slowpoke and myself Hit the Bay as a team this year and did really well. I just wanted to share a few shots of my own.As many of you know I am not much of a typer or a talker at times but i will give it a shot.The three of us fished Thursday with only ending up with one wee guy.  Friday Brian and I fished together and Shawn and Rob(Memart) went on hunt of thier own.It turned out to be a good day ,weather was good ,lake was calm and we bonused out with 4 nice eyes for the day. So on with the pictures.      And as you all know Saturday was all shawn but one.  And the sad part of the whole weekend was the last ride on the Bay.  All in all it was a fantstic weekend.Lots of fish but best of all great times with great friends. It was nice meeting a few of the other members that I had not met before and it was nice seeing the ones I had met before.Well thats my short story.I just want to thank our cabin gang for a great weekend and Shawn and Brian you guys have an open invitation in my boat. I dont know why i have double and triple pics but I will try and add more.  "
268825,irishfield,2008-11-18 03:34:00,26272,Great seeing you again Dan!! Some nice fish caught there.  I'm getting red x's... but that seems to be the norm lately with pics hosted on myfishingpics... they show one minute and not the next.
268831,Mike the Pike,2008-11-18 03:40:00,3421,Good to see you reporting Dan why is it the fish look so big in your arms and so little in Brian's arms your both close in size eh  Nice pics Dan I am glad you have a bigger boat now so you can take your 2 body guards fishing with you.    Is it really all over now.  So sad I just took everthing out of the boat tonight she will be going for winter storage   this week
