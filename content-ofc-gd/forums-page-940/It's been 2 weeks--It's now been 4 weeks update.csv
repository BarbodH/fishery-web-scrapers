267795,Beans,2008-11-15 22:12:00,3339,"  You can do it Rich but as long as you tell yourself you can't, you won't...  If you need a couple of good reasons take a look around and think what harm your second hand smoke is doing to them...  Hang in there Bernie...The best is yet to come !"
267802,chickenhawk,2008-11-15 22:40:00,612,keep up the good work bernie....i should quit also....startin to feel the effects.....   Hawk
267805,Bernie,2008-11-15 22:51:00,3190," You are just a young buck. Dont wait until you feel the effects at 50 or even 30 for that matter. QUIT NOW! Egads, I'm preaching already"
267813,John,2008-11-15 23:32:00,2956,"Way to go Bernie, nothing wrong with a little preaching to the non-believers!"
267814,misfish,2008-11-15 23:38:00,29133," If it helps others I say GO FOR IT. Im still batteling.  The brain says no no no,but well you know..........   Good news though,the mrs,s is going to go to the gym now aswell,so maybe if the both of us stop,it may just happen.Hard to stop when theres another in the house hold that still does.    Bernie,WELL DONE."
267818,bigugli,2008-11-15 23:44:00,6138,"You're getting there Bernie. One day at a time. In this race there is no finish line to look toward. Each day gets a little easier than the last, but that temptation is always there. I was having the smoking dream a couple of nights back, woke up and, right away, checked my dresser to make sure I hadn't done something stupid."
267819,Moosebunk,2008-11-15 23:48:00,3970,Stick to your guns man.  Smoking was something that I had to quit a few hundred times before one time finally stuck.  Good luck.
267842,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-16 01:01:00,1362,I quit cold turkey 9 yrs ago.....never looked back after that other than to kick myself in the arse for being such a moron...give yourself some type of a reward for accomplishing such a hard habit to break!!...I put the money that i saved aside and i was able to buy a new ATV  You're doing great bud!!!....keep it up!!
267884,Leecher,2008-11-16 02:22:00,7832," Keep it up Bernie, your doing great     It's a hard habit to kick but your doing great Leechman"
267926,Radnine,2008-11-16 04:00:00,1538,"You are to the point that you can quit watching the calendar. You are a non-smoker. People that never smoked don't wake up saying ""it's been 46 years, three months and ten days without a ciggy"". They just get on with life. Forget the bloody things, they aren't a part of who you are anymore (much like your mullet, or ex-wife, or plaid bell-bottoms, etc). Congratulations! Jim"
267937,Sandbag,2008-11-16 04:46:00,533,"Radnine.....have you read Allan Carr's ""The Easy Way""???  Some of your reasoning sounds like the book...and what a great book it was.  Cheers  Craig"
268035,Radnine,2008-11-16 15:22:00,1538,"What? A book with my thoughts! I smell a lawsuit. No, I have not read it, but thanks. Jim"
268097,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-16 18:42:00,3761,Congrads! My parents both quit smoking this past Febuary.
268130,JerseyDog,2008-11-16 20:09:00,190,"I think four weeks is far too early to let the guard down. Nicotine is a tricky beast.  I would recommend, being on guard (and counting off the days) for at least 8 to 12 weeks at which point, the pull will be very weak and easy to ignore."
268141,Bernie,2008-11-16 20:23:00,3190,"Thanks for all the reply's folks. Smoking is still an issue it appears. Would be good for us all if they just banned it altogether.    Wow are you ever right about that Jersey. Friday and yesterday were almost as bad as a couple days later. But fine today, not a bit of craving. I am really starting to feel better, no more cough in the morning and less huffing on the stairs.  Good luck to all that want to quit in the future. I hope you can do it."
268146,camillj,2008-11-16 20:42:00,1988,Way to go !!!  Keep it up Bernie ... and always remember .. the craving itself NEVER lasts for more than a couple of minutes ... so you ONLY have to be strong for a couple of minutes at a time .... but dont kid yourself ... even after 2 years or 20 years... you are always one puff away from being a smoker again .... so just dont take another puff - period.
268147,Leecher,2008-11-16 20:43:00,7832," Bernie, you couldn't of said it better     Ban it all together would be beneficial for us all  Keep it up     you're doing good Leechman aka Jacques"

267747,Guest skeeter99,2008-11-15 19:14:00,0,"Bernie   yep the stuff is great it basically turns off the nicotine receptor in your brain, so no withdrawl symptoms at all and when you do have a smoke """"out of the habit of lighting up"""" trust me it tastes awful it is like sticking your head up a dead fishes ass to put it in plain terms, thus you break the physical habit and the battle is half won and after the 12 weeks your brain does not know what nicotine is and the physical part of the habit is gone and bingo you are smoke free   everytime I smell a cig or go by the smoking area at work it actually helps me because is see them hacking and the stink of cigs is unreal!!!  then I think no thanks!!! it is that easy"
263533,bigugli,2008-10-31 12:16:00,6138,"Just keep at it Bernie. One dy at a time. Longest i had managed, in the past was 4 weeks.  It took a mass coronary and flat lining on the slab to make me a non-smoker.  I urge any of you still smoking. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.   About the cravings Bernie. 8 years later and I still get the occasional hankering for a smoke. It happens every time I get a whiff of a good blend of pipe or a premium cigar. I quickly compensate and have me a good glass of Napoleon or Cognac."
