I shot a Doe at 2 pm on the Monday, i think it was 16 degrees, at the time. Another fella in the gang got a buck with the some odd antlers on Thursday morning.  We hunt down in Niagara area, 89A and it was a good thing we new a guy with a walk in cooler (converted sea container with refer unit) to store the meat until we butchered on the Sunday. yum love the deer sausage "
