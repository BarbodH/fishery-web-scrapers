268567,Arnaldo de Sousa,2008-11-17 21:35:00,21,Looking to take the little guy out this winter for some ice fishing.  Anyone know what manufactures make floatation suits for children.  My little guy is 6 years old.   Thanks in advance.

268587,bigugli,2008-11-17 22:05:00,6138,You must realize that you will be buying float suits every other year.  I know Helly Hansen made suits for all ages. I saw them displayed at a trade show.  I don't know if they are available in those sizes in Canada. I know mustang does not.

Not sure if they make the whole suit, but I figured He could where his snow pants with them. This way he feels like one of the guys in his bright orange jacket, like everyone else. It's a Christmas present so shhhh."
