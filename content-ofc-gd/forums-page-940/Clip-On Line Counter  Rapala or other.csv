268815,irishfield,2008-11-18 03:23:00,26272,Yes... they work pretty good.. at least on a bait caster. Guess on a spinning you could put them above the first eye.
268823,Mike the Pike,2008-11-18 03:32:00,3421,Yes they work well my brother in law has one and is happy with it.
268828,Rich,2008-11-18 03:37:00,3927,"I have one, haven't actually used it on the water (I rarely troll and when I do I usually forget it) but played with it in the backyard and seems pretty accurate. Certainly more accurate than guessing!"
268836,forrest,2008-11-18 03:51:00,1032,"I have one.  it has a light on it! I had little troubles with it, once the braid got caught underneath the counting mechanism. For the $16 I paid it was a good buy.  I use it on a bait caster and had to manually remove line from my reel, maybe due to the slick braid line.  forrest  PS: For $60 you can get a Penn 209 with built in line counter."
268872,young_one,2008-11-18 08:00:00,620,"I have one aswel, use it on spining rod. It is abit more hassel than one piece line counter reels  A good tip if you are using it. If you know you'll consistantly fish at a certain distance, like 100feet,(usually for trolling) use permanent marker to paint a foot of line on the 100' mark. Ive had great success with this method on PowerPro braided line, the colour doesn't come off very easily, but you can always reapply every now and then.  Another method is to tie a bobber stopper, just becareful when ur cutting the knot off, don't cut ur main line."

268926,dannyboy,2008-11-18 14:17:00,367,"They work quite well and technically they are more precise than a line counter, just not as convenient.  Dan"
268948,Hotrod2066,2008-11-18 15:23:00,40,I have a shakespeare one and I use it to wind the line on my reels so I know how much I'm putting on. I don't troll.
