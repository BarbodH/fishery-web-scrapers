I went online earlier this evening and I have come to realize that there arent any rivers in the york area that have fishing for trout or steelhead. We have the Holland river but the water is merky and not likley to hold many fish. Hopefuly i'm wrong and there are some trout fisheries in this area. Any thoughts? thanks, Marcus"
