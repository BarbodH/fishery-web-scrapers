251490,Badger Shark,2008-09-21 04:12:00,291,"I bought my Alumacraft from Hurst Marina 3 years ago.  Unfortunately I believe they got out of fishing boats all together.  I really dont know where there is a dealer anymore.  I thought there was one near Toronto but not sure.  I saw Alumacraft boats in Wasaga beach at a dealer there.  Try a search on the internet.  I will say this, Alumacraft has to be the best boat I have owned and is a really solid well built boat.  Mine handles really well and is very stable.  It is 7.6 feet wide and this is why it is so stable, it handles rough water well too as it got a really good test last year on Quinte with 50 plus KM winds and big waves.  Hope you find one, you wont regret the purchase.  You may also see if there are dealers in New York state."
251491,Casey123,2008-09-21 04:18:00,461,Bay CIty Marine in Hamilton is the closet dealer to Ottawa.
251492,SlowPoke,2008-09-21 04:39:00,2984,I would think Sturgeon Falls would be a little closer... by about 100 kms.
251506,Alumacraft,2008-09-21 11:18:00,139,I picked mine up at Seaway Marine in Whitby  
251508,F7Firecat,2008-09-21 11:48:00,347,Im in the market for a new baot and Im thinking is going to be an Alumacraft.  Also looking at the Trpohy but probably a 185  Went to Bay City and it will take 6 weeks delivery.  Might wait until the boat show to buy though.
251581,hdefjunkie,2008-09-21 19:29:00,10,"Thanks alot guys. This gives me options. I as well might wait it out for the boat show but am following a few used market leads.  Originally was looking at HarberCrafts, seems to be highly regarded, solid, no frills outfit. Though the price is nowhere near the Trophy's.  Fortunately I had the opportunity to fish out of a 175 this summer, very solid boat even in the 2-3ft rollers."
251616,Scott S,2008-09-21 22:56:00,203,"What's everbodys take on Allumacraft. I just checked out their website and was impressed with their product. Haven't seen that many, would like to here your opinion. Scooter"
251681,silveradosheriff,2008-09-22 02:33:00,1025," I have a Navigator 165CS with the F-90 and love it. Small enough to play in most places, and wide and deep enough to handle the big water (on reasonable days). Doubles as a waterski and tubing boat for the family  :-)  "
251699,hdefjunkie,2008-09-22 03:14:00,10,"Nice outfit  Lots of outfits state side, ooohh what I give to have to live in Minnesota for a couple of months. Them and Lunds are like hockey and beer up here. Probably since the're made in MN. Too bad they're not well represented here in the east, like Crestliner.  Anyhow, wondering if anyone bought a unit in the US which still had warranty on the OB. Yamaha and Suzuki are my front runners. I suspect the warranty is lost, but thought I'd ask. I have a message into Alumacraft to see where they stand."
251714,Badger Shark,2008-09-22 05:37:00,291,"I have owned a Lund, a Legend (never again) and now my Alumacraft and I am so impressed with it my next boat will be Alumacraft.  I have 16,7 full windshield and have had it in big water in very rough weather and it is very sturdy.  My next one will be a bit bigger with more Horses.  My current boat has a 75 mer. optimax and it is a great motor, always starts of the first crank and I get good gas mileage.  If you want more info send me a message , I live in Ottawa as well.  Don"
251726,Mr. Follow,2008-09-22 10:10:00,34,Hey there I bought a new alumacraft this year there are only 3 dealers in Ontario that deal them Bay City in hamilton. One is wasaga and the one on sturgeon. I called all three Bay city gave me the best Price. The one in Sturgeon didn't want to sell me a new boat and tried to pawn off a used one that was no where near what I wanted. and Wasaga was way over priced I got my entire package for 6000 less at Bay city the what wasaga offered and the boat from wasaga had no electronics  obn it. Blows my mind how some people do business.  IF you go to www.alumacraft.com they have a Dealer locator on there ansd maybe there is one close to u in Quebec. I purchased a Navigator 175 awesome boat with a great ride. 
251751,silveradosheriff,2008-09-22 12:14:00,1025,"There is also a dealer in Kinmount, ask for Jenn.  http://www.walstenmarine.com"
251752,hdefjunkie,2008-09-22 12:18:00,10,"6K that's kind of ridiculous. Goes to show ya, it really pays to shop around. Here's what Alumacraft send in regards to ""closest"" dealers in/around Ottawa.  MOTO SPORT ST. JEROME, INC WALSTEN MARINE  I've talked to a few dealers, some mentioned here and a couple others up north. Ya know, the thing that bugs me the most is these dealers almost hold you hostage if you really want an Alumacraft. No movement at all on price. Speak to a dealer in the US, and they'll wheel and deal no problem.  Far as I can see, buying new in the US is attractive from a price perspective but the trade off would be service or denied warranty service from the CDN dealer. Also I believe the warranty on the ""new"" motor would be invalid."
251760,hdefjunkie,2008-09-22 13:02:00,10,"Anyone know the difference between the Dominator and Trophy?  Far as I can see, weight and load capacity are higher on the Trophy which leads me to believe the construction is slightly different."
251820,lookinforwalleye,2008-09-22 16:45:00,4399,"I have a Navigator165 full windshield and have no problems, solid well built boat.  A lot better than those skinny Lund`s out there!!!  Just kidding if you like skinny Lunds thats cool!"
251823,lookinforwalleye,2008-09-22 16:51:00,4399,  They are identical boats with the obvious difference beng one is a full windshield and the other is a single windshield.
251833,hdefjunkie,2008-09-22 17:24:00,10,"Far as I can tell from website, the Dom Sport has walk through windshield, like the Trophy. Also noticed the front storage is a little different, closed vs open in the Trophy. What I'm really wondering if the construction is beefy'r (sp?) on the Trophy."
251841,Alumacraft,2008-09-22 17:59:00,139,"Hdefjunkie the difference in construction maybe the gauge of almuminum used. Also there is probably a second bottom hull plate and bow plate on the trophy. Some models have double bow and hull plates some only have double bow plate depends on the model and length.The Dominator 17.5 probably has a second bow plate and hull plate the diference maybe the thickness of the second plate. Ask for a cataloge from Alumacraft and read the spec's section you'll get all the info you need to compare the different models. I have had my Magnum for 5 years and I love it. It handles the water great nice dry ride. No feed back steering is awsome, mine has a huge livewell, lots of well layed out storage, nice wide carpeted gunnels. Which ever Alumacraft you decide on you won't be disappointed.  Rob "
251860,hdefjunkie,2008-09-22 19:13:00,10,Thanks... So the specs are more comprehensive in the printed material than website?
252003,hdefjunkie,2008-09-23 03:02:00,10,"Ok. Kinda answered my own questions, with some help.. Found more details on dealer website.  Dom 175 Sport: 2XB HULL THICKNESS .080""/.080"", 2+2 seats Trophy 175: 2XB HULL THICKNESS .100""/.100"", convertible bow, 3+2 seats"
252127,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-23 18:24:00,0,"Yup. Alumacraft is a well built boat. Been threw alot, but no leaks, the water guards keep you from getting wet, especially when on plane, handles big water well. All around solid boat!! Definitely worth the $$$. And I would definitely put a Yamaha on the back to make the boat complete!"
252130,hdefjunkie,2008-09-23 18:38:00,10,"Yep, it's between a Yammy and Zuk. Leaning more towards the Zuk, since they offer a 6yr warranty. Wonder if Yammy will step up on the warranty in '09?"
252132,SlowPoke,2008-09-23 18:54:00,2984, Not that there is anything wrong with Suzuki but I've found part availabilty and service to be much more difficult to find than OMC/Honda/Merc/Yamaha. They do have a growing dealer network so those issues may be shrinking.
252141,hdefjunkie,2008-09-23 19:20:00,10,"Ya, I read that online as well. Also heard the parts situation was improving. Not sure how true this is.  The boat will live up north and there's a local dealer for both Yammy and Suk. Should be covered either way."
