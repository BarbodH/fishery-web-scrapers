252256,forrest,2008-09-24 01:31:00,1032,I googled it but was unable to find a description:  What is a Michgan handle and why do people like it?
252258,ChrisK,2008-09-24 01:37:00,2772,This is what I came up with.............. http://fish.shimano.com/publish/content/gl...e_Spinning.html
252260,forrest,2008-09-24 01:47:00,1032," That is where I saw it first too.  Where is the info on what it is?  It looks like a regular handle to me, but, google searches people disappointed that some companies no longer have the handle as an option.  forrest"
252261,ChrisK,2008-09-24 01:49:00,2772,"I don't know,to me it doesn't look any different than any other handle...I like the blanke its sitting on though,nice pole."
252267,Bly,2008-09-24 02:09:00,1556,"Hey Forrest, I was born and raised in Michigan and haven't a clue  lol  Will ask a few friends and see if they know....."
252275,Burtess,2008-09-24 02:33:00,901,A Michigan handle is a rod with a longer fore grip and shorter rear grip. Such as this one:  http://products.gloomis.com/gl/products/al...D=1222223465056 My buddy uses an old Quantum with this handle style and likes it...  Burt
252294,bassjnkie,2008-09-24 03:25:00,1101,"Found this:  Michigan: Designed for steelhead fishing (wading), the handle has a fly grip on the front fore grip and a small four (4) inch rear grip. The Michigan handle allows an angler to utilize the vast majority of the rod without him worrying about the handle splashing in the water nor hitting him in the ribs."
252302,kemper,2008-09-24 04:02:00,2232,"One of the many things I learned while Building my float rod  long fore grip, short rear grip.  That said, it would feel wrong me to, I like a long rear grip and short fore grip"

252312,kentooley,2008-09-24 09:56:00,208,"OF. Just woke up and  I'm still laughing  :clapping: :clapping I hope you don't mind but I had to send it to some friends in Ohio. I needed that!! You, my man are a funny guy!!!  God Bless You!!"
252321,Alumacraft,2008-09-24 11:34:00,139,I prefer the Michigan handle I find it lets me fight the fish with less strain on the wrist and in the uber cold months your not holding onto metal reel seat which can get very cold.
252361,kemper,2008-09-24 14:17:00,2232,"That is a good point alumacraft...  How is it for control, I feel like I would have trouble keeping a solid hold on the rod with my hand way down low...no leverage?"
252372,johnnyb,2008-09-24 14:55:00,3413,"The longer foregrip lets you brace the rod under your forearm while fighting, without craning your wrist to hold onto the reel seat.  Bracing the rod against the length of your arm gives you all kinds of control and leverage....try it while fighting on your float road...your arm just becomes longer extension of the rod."
252381,kemper,2008-09-24 15:49:00,2232,  Thats exactly how I fight my  fish on the float rod...only I brace my arm against the rear grip...  I guess its the same idea
252398,Paulus,2008-09-24 17:59:00,522," ""him""?!?!? apologize to Bly!!!    p.-"
252412,bassjnkie,2008-09-24 18:50:00,1101,  I really hope your kidding   ? I found that on a site and copy and pasted it. I will contact the owner of the site to apologize to Bly
