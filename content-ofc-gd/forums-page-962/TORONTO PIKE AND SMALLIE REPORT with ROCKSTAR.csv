250596,snag,2008-09-17 21:18:00,1932,"Greetings, Greetings,  Been busy lately. More to come.  I wasn't going to post until October but I got all excited..... I found a new spot for pike today, Lakeside.  Got out for lunch this afternoon and caught a couple smallies and 2 surprise pike.  I was tubing for smallies when this dude bit me off. That's the tube in his mouth:   Soon afterward I caught this guy with one of Clive's (aka Mepps) spinners:   Lure: Rockstar (the Clash) Length: long Weight: getting heavy    The Toronto smallies have (not) enjoyed Clive's lures either:    Since I located a couple bass holes last year in T.O. I've noticed that the small 1 to 2 pound regulars have put some size and weight on. A crowd was here for this one (there was a swarm of black flies on my face)   Here's a bunch of flukes     Brunch of Loogans, I met up with Highdrifter and Wild Billy last week to show them a honey hole. We all caught a few bass each, had some great follows and lost a couple.  They were very trusting. The spot required a short kayak paddle and all i had was 1 inflatable kayak. I proposed that we attach my line to the 'yak and go to the island one at a time. Luckily, there was enough line to reel the kayak back and forth from the mainland! Here's Fidel taking line,   I was worried that with the effort of getting there that we might not catch anything and a mutiny would ensue.  10min. later Here's the 1st one of the day.    Fidel feeling the fishes pain,  Fishing makes me happy!  I lost some pics of Fidel with another ""smallie"" but I think he and Billy have some extras. Fidel had his fly rod (11-13'?) Fish on,  Billy brought a net which was good because the rocks were wet and slimy  Here's Billy with a fish that he's failed to share because he's selfish and conceited.  Later that day, somewhere else, on a grub spinner   ROCKSTAR!!  I owe Clive a descent intro to the gifts he sent. However, my computer time has had to take a back seat for summer fun!  I received this package last winter/spring and even though I have not been out as much as I've wanted, they've produced!  Here's the package with a love note and lures,  These are beautiful lures!   The really cool thing is that each one is customized on the inside of the spinner:         My top producer for multiple species so far. THE CLASH!    So, now you'll know what I'm talking about every time a ROCKSTAR reference comes up!  Thanks again Clive!   last but not least,   Why do you cops keep pulling me over?    adios,  S."
