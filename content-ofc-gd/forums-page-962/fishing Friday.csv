251544,Terry,2008-09-21 15:59:00,14456,"So armed with the new knowledge from the Ottawa river muskie trip, I took Friday off to fish a Kawartha lake We stopped at the first big weed patch and tried jigging for some walleye, bass were biting but not the walleye then we trolled for walleye along the weed edge then put on big baits for muskie and a small muskie was nice enough to take my offering  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3349.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3349.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  then we tried a few more spots for walleye with little luck but the bass were there too  well back to trolling,  the spinnerbait not too far behind the boat just enough that the blades are disturbing the surface, but not breaking the surface... another small muskie bites my hook, dang it looks like the same fish , I wonder if it swam across the lake just to bite my hook a second time..  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=muskieterry.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/muskieterry.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  that was it for muskie, brings my number to five this year...guess I will not reach boating 30 this year like I did last year..LOL  back to the first walleye spot and they finally decided to bit too so it was a great day on the water well any day you take off work to go fishing is a great day"

251552,jwl,2008-09-21 16:48:00,1056,"good going on the fish, those ones are usually scrappy little buggers, hopefully I have the same thing to report mid week, heading on a couple day musky mission later this evening.  Thanks for sharing the pics, cool markings on those ones"
251561,Radnine,2008-09-21 17:27:00,1538,"Nevermind the same fish, I think it's the same picture! They look healthy though eh? Perfect fish. Good call by the way, on the work vs. fishing question."
