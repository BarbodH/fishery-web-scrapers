251885,snag,2008-09-22 20:30:00,1932,"I'll never forget this little meeting  I was on my kayak under a bridge/dock.  There were about 10 but 4 in particular that got very close.  They were nice in size.  I didn't even want to catch them.  It was just so coooool.  You'll notice that they had me surrounded!!  Here's a brief taste:  Dolphins or Smallmouth bass?   Here's another vid of some friends coming to say goodbye to their buddy Again, about 10+ swarming but at least 4-6 in the shot.  This was about a week after the 1st vid.  Please don't leave us!  What do you think?   p.s. thanks for the link Clive  S."
251926,Master of Bait,2008-09-22 23:24:00,196,"Really cool.  Couldn't get the second link though (need login?).  It seems that smallies are really curious fish.  Those guys look like they're just checking out your boat.  I once had a similar thing happen when a smallie got ""mesmerized"" by my bright neon yellow painted boat.  He just hovered there, up on the surface in 20+ feet on lake Erie.  He was so dazed that I was able to slide my hand underneath him and start lifting him out of the water before he ""snapped out of it"" and took off.  Cool stuff."
251929,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-22 23:30:00,241,Cool footage! I think that we should try to catch some of them there bad boys either Thursday or Friday. What say you?
251934,ccmtcanada,2008-09-22 23:42:00,7971,"And that's sporting?  To catch those things? LOL.  Great footage Grant...and yeah, I couldn't see the second one either....said it was set on private."
251948,forrest,2008-09-23 00:15:00,1032,"cool vid, when do we get to see the 2nd one?   PS: cute little critters......are supposed to be clubbed and eaten."
251955,Dozer,2008-09-23 00:35:00,896,Next time stick your finger in the water and try to entice a bite   Or go skinny dipping!
251956,Joey,2008-09-23 00:36:00,9122,That's very cool Snag.  You need one of these.  I got this mag in the mail today and when I saw it I thought of you and your kayaking.  Its made by Hammacher Schlemmer.    Joey
251960,PatrickGG,2008-09-23 00:57:00,562,The ultimate tease if i had no gear and seen that happen but heck with it the video is just as good as catching them.
251966,love2fishhave2work,2008-09-23 01:07:00,212,"I think like the dolphin and shark analogy, they were trying to warn you about the gar pike that made a very quick appearance at the 29/30 second mark.  Great video."
251982,snag,2008-09-23 01:38:00,1932,"Try the second one now.  It's not as stellar as the 1st!  Dock smallie support group  Should work.  Unlike the 1st vid, I did catch a wad of these guys with various presentations but didn't bother with pics (they all looked exactly the same!)  Voyeurs!!!!!  P.s. I'll reply later to your comments"
252015,BillM,2008-09-23 03:43:00,17367,"SNAG, I think they were about to gang up on you!!!"
252065,snag,2008-09-23 13:30:00,1932," Interesting, I wonder if the yellow colour of the kayak has anything to do with it? Perhaps I'll try some yellow bait!   O.k. you'll need a yak! Actually the second vid is accessible.   Private? Oh ya, I'm part of a secret society (we sacrifice humanoids). If you want to see it, send a sacrificial offering.  It's hard to club them accurately when they are in the water.   They're not Piranha! (I hope)   Actually Hammacher Schlemmer are just a distributor. 15 years ago I worked with a company that tried to get the exclusive rights for Canada for those.  They come from Hawaii. The company was Clear Blue Hawaii.  The cool thing about them is that when the bottom gets all scratched up, the scratches will disappear once it's in the water!   Yup!      I don't want to die by the fins of fish"
252092,ehg,2008-09-23 15:31:00,2666,Great little videos  I think you are now the king of fishing the Toronto waterfront!  ehg  PS: Big largies at the islands in the summer as well.
252120,bassfighter,2008-09-23 17:50:00,366,"Are you sure you are not Dr. Dolittle!  Maybe if you really listen, those fish were saying please be nice to us!  Better not be too personable, or you might not fish again or join P3TA organization, if you get too intimate with them!"
252122,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-23 18:02:00,0,Cool vids. There are some decent smallies to be caught off Toronto's/Lake O's shoreline.
252248,snag,2008-09-24 01:07:00,1932," King???!!  Now that's an honour coming from you!!! I'm just lucky enough to get out. Thanks,  I would love to get some island largies!!!!!   I thought of P3TA at the time but I also missed lunch and all I could see were fish sticks swimming in plum sauce.   Sure are, Drop me a line if you're ever in town. You've got some good tricks up your sleeve I'd love to gleam."
252264,Dano,2008-09-24 01:52:00,719,"Ha ha, thats pretty cool. I wonder if they are taking the lead from the geese and seagulls and are getting used to people feeding them."
252400,Paulus,2008-09-24 18:08:00,522,  thanks for sharing that incredible footage! it's cool when they school!  p.-
