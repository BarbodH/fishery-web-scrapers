251870,Reef Runner,2008-09-22 19:40:00,980,"Maybe they heard the Cops were coming and high tailed it out of there!  lol, just kidding.  Bluebird sky and tough fishing go hand in hand for me.  At least you got into a decent Bass.  WTG!"
251936,ccmtcanada,2008-09-22 23:49:00,7971,At least you got out there and caught a fish!!!  We didn't even wet a line this past weekend!  Good job Scott.....the steelies will be running soon....polished the dust off trout gear yet?
251945,mikeh,2008-09-23 00:05:00,824,"we were out on Sunday as well, and did about as good as you did. We started out by Cesarea with not much luck and went to the Scugog river and couldn't find anything so we went back around cesarea and ended our day."
251958,Joey,2008-09-23 00:45:00,9122,Nice bass Scott.  Way to go  Joey
252050,bassman,2008-09-23 12:27:00,384,"  Funny enough, the cops have been out the last two weekends. They have been thoroughly checking every boat in Scugog. The one officer mentioned that he handed out 16 tickets two weekends ago."
