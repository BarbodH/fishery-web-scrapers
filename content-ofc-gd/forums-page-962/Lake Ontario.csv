Water was plenty rough out there could only troll east with the wind. Went 13/14 with a mix of small kings and bows. white/blue spinny with a skiens machine fly caught most off the rigger 55ft down. Sunday went out again, looked like a nicer morning. Got out to the BZ and the waves picked up again could only troll one way South. Hit a bow right away 22ft down before we could get the rods all down. picked up 2 more and lossed 2, one was a hugh bow that was peeling line.Water got too rough so we pulled up and headed into Port C. Fished 125-30fow, lots of bait but not many fish. Manged 2 bows off a green glow frog spoon.  heres a few pics of my buddies and a group pic infront of my new boat! Cant wait for the big water next year!!!!  Ryan         My buddies first fish out riggin'    they did let me reel in one!    The new Boat and a few fish for the smoker "
