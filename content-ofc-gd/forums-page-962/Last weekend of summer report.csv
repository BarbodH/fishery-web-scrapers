Lets just hope the fall turns out better is all I can say  Saturday Mike and I hooked up Saturday for another day of bass hunting but it seems the bass have figure out our tricks.  We scooted up to our first spot and proceeded to get skunked. On the way to the next 'sure thing' spot Mike landed our first keeper of the day:  <a href=""   title=""That's a keeper by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3089/2877569252_e0a03105b4.jpg"" width=""367"" height=""500"" alt=""That's a keeper"" /></a>  Mr goby didn't get back into the water, thanks for playing  Our sure thing spot of course didn't produce so much as a follow so we started trying a mix of known spot and new spots during our bass hunting but we just couldn't get a pattern down.  We picked up a fish here and there but never using the same approach or in the same spots.  Talk about frustrating.  Anyhow, here's the bass:  The first off the day, taken off a pad:  <a href=""   title=""First real fish by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/2876737697_c83b10bcc0_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""First real fish"" /></a>  Next up was a smallie taken of a white/chartruese spinner bait <a href=""   title=""Let go of my spinner! by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3027/2877570398_571539d77f_b.jpg"" width=""647"" height=""1024"" alt=""Let go of my spinner!"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Without the spinner bait by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2876738583_fd3b94286a_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""769"" alt=""Without the spinner bait"" /></a>  Mike finally upgraded his Goby with this decent largie (forget what he came on)  <a href=""   title=""Mikes first of the day by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2877571348_6176183987_b.jpg"" width=""951"" height=""1024"" alt=""Mikes first of the day"" /></a>  A while later I landed another largie by hitting him on the head with a red spinner bait  <a href=""   title=""rock shelf largie by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3278/2877572052_c4e33f47d1_b.jpg"" width=""805"" height=""1024"" alt=""rock shelf largie"" /></a>  Mike with a little largie that torpedo'd from under a pad for the pink frog  <a href=""   title=""Really wanted that pink frog by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3134/2876740283_e60b4a0520_b.jpg"" width=""663"" height=""1024"" alt=""Really wanted that pink frog"" /></a>  The frog patterned popper also got Mike a couple <a href=""   title=""Top water bass by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3279/2877573218_ceb367de7f_b.jpg"" width=""790"" height=""1024"" alt=""Top water bass"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Another on the frog popper by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3069/2876741307_74db59faac_b.jpg"" width=""652"" height=""1024"" alt=""Another on the frog popper"" /></a>  That was it for the bass - never two the same and no real size of note.  At the end of the day Mike wanted to target pike at a spot he knew and sure enough HE found a pattern.  A red/black slop master got mike 3 pike in 3 passes. I had a push that didn't hit again and spinner bait that came off when I reeled in too fast getting the net for Mike's fish. Figures - he gets the fish and I loose the lure   .  Anyhow, here's a water shot of one of the guys  <a href=""   title=""One of the days pike by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3226/2877574946_3e28616932_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""878"" alt=""One of the days pike"" /></a>  That was it for that day.  On the way home I told Mike I was planning to take it easy Sunday, maybe hit the Grand but basically sleep in, do some stuff around the house, etc.  Mike says 'want to hit Sugog for musky instead?'  Okie dokie, my plans are changed:  Sunday Holy cold day batman! We left a little late after the long Saturday and arrive to a cold wind.  We bundled up with the extra clothes Mike had on the boat and proceeded to have what's politely called ""one of those days"".  Two hours in and Mike finally gets the first action of they day.  We thought it was a good start (we're hunting Musky so going a couple hours before the first fish isn't too bad).  Unfortunately it wasn't a musky, it was a nice largie on Mike's now favourite spinner - the red/black slop master:  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2877586640/"" title=""Nice hat! by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3055/2877586640_ddaa898f7e_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""1018"" alt=""Nice hat!"" /></a>  Note the stylish hat  Not 15 minutes later and Mike corrects the species mistake with this scrapper:  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2876755383/"" title=""Scugog muskie by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3218/2876755383_b64a19a9b2_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""807"" alt=""Scugog muskie"" /></a>  Ok, we're onto something right?  Wrong - over the next 6 hours Mike caught a rock bass (a nice one however) and I caught a one pound largie.  Sigh....  We called it at 5 to avoid punishing ourselves any more.  Talking to some other guys it sounds like no one had a particularly good day so I guess we can always fall back into the old cliche of ""Misery loves company"". Well misery loves more fish too   .  So thats it for summer 2008 - now on to the fall bite, bring it on!!!"
251666,bigugli,2008-09-22 01:36:00,6138,"Sudden shift in the weather overnight really screwed it up today. Yep, misery loves company. My tally today, 2 hammer handles  and a 14"" bass for 4 hours work. At least something got caught."
251671,fishindevil,2008-09-22 01:53:00,6254,"Well the weather was perfect,at least you guys got into some decent fish !!! the are looks great too,thanks for sharing...cheers   oh ya good job on killing that goby,20 million more and we will be all done !!..LOL..LOL.."
251690,PatrickGG,2008-09-22 03:00:00,562,"Good stuff Sean and Mike, Fall weather is sure starting up lets just hope Indian summer will bring a couple of warm weeks before the cold snap of Autumn kicks in."
251705,chickenhawk,2008-09-22 03:29:00,612,nice colours on that muskie! nothing to complain about there guys....nice lookin fish  Hawk
251756,mikeh,2008-09-22 12:40:00,824,"great report Sean, Saturday was a lot of fun fishing, although the ride back to the launch was a little bumpy. Sunday was one of those musky hunting days with some lily pad fishing mixed in. That black/orange slopmaster worked on the pike, musky and large mouth it was a hot lure for the weekend."
251763,snag,2008-09-22 13:11:00,1932,Do you ever get skunked?  Nice one guys!
251771,ozaibak1,2008-09-22 13:44:00,401,"Hey thats not such a bad day of fishin, it coulda been a lot worse!"
251774,tbayboy,2008-09-22 13:55:00,1497,"It took 6 hours for me to get my first and only fish Sunday so I was pretty much sure I was in for a skunking (not sure that puny little bass even counted, think Mike's rock bass was bigger).  Scugog always seems to do that too me - it's feast or famine"
251786,corvette1,2008-09-22 14:33:00,1765,"nice job guys bass, pike, skis wear are the eyes for the grand slam"
251797,LeXXington,2008-09-22 15:13:00,1928,"LOL, still lookes like some nice fish .   great report"
