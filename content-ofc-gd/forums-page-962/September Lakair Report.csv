251830,ehg,2008-09-22 17:11:00,2666,Yeah that bird is a 'Common Flicker' considered part of woodpecker family.  Looks like a good time was had by all!  Really like the campfire video w/ the music kinda like tunes from the 30's. Thanks for posting.
251847,BITEME,2008-09-22 18:39:00,1969,the bird is a Medowlark
251850,Leecher,2008-09-22 18:46:00,7832,Great report and pics Joey  It's good to see that there was a good turn around and that everyone had a good time.  Love the view of the cabin  Thanks for sharing Leechman
251862,ChrisK,2008-09-22 19:19:00,2772,"Hey Joey, Nice job on the report and the campfire video was really cool.. It was nice to see everyone again and hopefully this fall G2G will become part of our traditional Lakair get togethers."
251895,Rich Clemens,2008-09-22 21:03:00,3131,Great report Joey.  Was good to see you folks again for a bit this past Friday.   I suspect Paul didn't get his musky either.   Next year .. just wait until next year.   I say that all the time.
251896,mattyk,2008-09-22 21:07:00,2110,"thanks for the report, some nice pics!"

251923,Ron,2008-09-22 23:18:00,1683,"Looks like a blast Joey! Too bad the fishes didn't want to come out and play though. Like you said, spending a day fishing with Lew would be worth the admission fee anyways!"
251943,Moosebunk,2008-09-23 00:00:00,3970,Crikey Joey.  That was HUGE with pics.  Thanks for that.  I was wondering how many went blind from the Moonshine?
251954,Joey,2008-09-23 00:27:00,9122,"Thanks for all the responses everyone.  I'm still replaying the fun we had up there in my head.  Work was brutal and so was traffic today so reality has set in once again  Drew, there were a few blind mice and that's all I gotta say about that  Joey"
251974,Daplumma,2008-09-23 01:24:00,1961,Thanx for the pics and the report.Wish I was there. Joe

251697,Joey,2008-09-22 03:09:00,9122, Thank you Darren  Joey
251719,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-22 07:00:00,1183,Well I'd say you had a great week's vacation...enjoyed reading this and nice pics as well.  Love GCD's hat.  I was going to say that the bird was a partridge...or maybe a flicker is the same thing...but what do I know.  haha
251721,lew,2008-09-22 09:05:00,12767,"Great wrap-up of the week Joey, thanks !!  Always good spending time with you guys and I was really sorry that I had to leave 4 days early, but as you know I had things to take care of, but thankfully, everything worked out well.  Looks like I missed out on a good party on Saturday night, unfortunately.  Really enjoyed fishing with you, it was just unfortunate that those darned winds kept us from fishing those islands we headed for, but we'll get one of those big girls next June  Roger & I had the same problems with the winds on Friday morning.  Here's a good shot of you just before you landed the paddle  See you guys in November.  "
251725,SlowPoke,2008-09-22 09:38:00,2984,"Great report Joey! I wondered if Chris snuck away for the weekend, things were pretty quite here in London. That's a pretty rare photo of Roy without a hat on! Glen told me that Roy even wears his hat in the shower... I'm not sure how Glen would know. hmmmm I'm sorry I couldn't be there, it looked like ""all y'all"" had fun! -Brian"
251727,Terry,2008-09-22 10:13:00,14456,wow.......great report  almost like being there

251737,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-22 10:55:00,241,"Awesome report! I had an amazing time and it all went by too fast! It was great meeting so many of you and I look forward to the next hurrah. Fishing was tough for us as well....with about 3 days of fishing averaging 8 hours a day on the water, i only managed 8 or 9 fish. Glen's skunk hat is priceless! That jam footage is hilarious as well......only after imbibing numerous shots of moonshine would I ever play Yngwie Malmsteen arpeggio sweeps over a slow blues jam! Thanks to everyone that kept me in the sauce on Saturday night! And now, it's back to work."
