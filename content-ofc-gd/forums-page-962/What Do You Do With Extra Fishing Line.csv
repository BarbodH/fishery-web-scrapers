251627,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-21 23:58:00,3761,"When i get fishing line i almost always purchase a 300 yard spool of it, and this will do about 2 reels with 20+yards of line left over. I think next year i am going to get a 1000yard spool of fishing line, but what do you do with the extra line i have right now?"
251630,Marko,2008-09-22 00:07:00,854,"If you don't plan on using it for anything you should be able to take it to the tackle shop in your area, they should be able to recycle that."
251636,JohnF,2008-09-22 00:14:00,3494,"Hang pictures, tie up plants, leader material  JF"
251639,bigugli,2008-09-22 00:32:00,6138,"Great for hanging mobiles, making windchimes or repairing old mocassins. 12 lb Fireline is far superior to the thread the shoe factory uses    or  As Marko said, let the local tackle shop recycle it for you."
251659,Rich,2008-09-22 01:23:00,3927,"I still have about 40 spools with small amounts of line on them. I packrat them, I'll figure something useful when I retire. lol"
251711,huntervasili,2008-09-22 04:34:00,1604,"I use mine to snell hooks, make walleye spinners/worm harnesses, or drop it off at a line recycling depot"
251716,OhioFisherman,2008-09-22 05:53:00,6623,"On some reels I use it for a backing, just don`t usually need 120 yards of new line on most of my reels, a Salmon may spool you not much chance of a bass doing it. Pike or ski probably won`t either."
251851,kemper,2008-09-22 18:46:00,2232,"Lots of great suggestions, but do you really want to purchase 1000 yards of line?  I would never buy bulk like that unless I had 20 rods to spool and they all were used often.  Also different lines for different applications, for example bass fishing in the slop and tubin for smallies require two different lines.  Id suggest maybe a couple different tests in smaller packages?"
251868,bassjnkie,2008-09-22 19:36:00,1101,"I agree with Kemper. 1000yrds or line kinda gives you one option. I have 10 or 12 carp/match set-ups which covers every situation, if I were to buy 1000yrds, than I only covering one situation. Same with my bass, pike, muskie and walleye gear. Different line for different situations.  Hope this helps, Daniel"
251881,mepps,2008-09-22 20:20:00,1301,Buy biodegradable line and just compost it!
251883,anders,2008-09-22 20:29:00,1168,use some for ice fishing.  I buy 1000 yrd spool for my bait caster.  I re spool them a couple time each year and the bulk line is usually ran out in 2 years.
251940,bassman,2008-09-22 23:56:00,384,"I've bought 2 large spools of Power Pro. 40lb for my baitcasters & 20lb for my spinners. In the long run it's a lot cheaper buying in bulk. These 1500' spools cost app. $110-120 bucks on eBay, but be very weary of knock off product.  The store that I've been using on eBay for years is called HarleeRod.  Good luck"
252166,1Harringtona,2008-09-23 21:02:00,77,heres an easy answer ... just give me the line
252236,Photoz,2008-09-24 00:05:00,792,"Ever thought of finding a tackle store that sells bulk line, and spools up exactly the amout you need . . . .     nothing wasted here? Out east . . .    Gagnon's in Oshawa, & Tightlines in Pickering . . . .    west . .    Fishing Depot out near the airport (Ronson Drive) Hamilton . .     Fishing World to name a few. Costs about the same, and nicely & evenly put on your reel."
