252133,Hooked,2008-09-23 18:55:00,891,"  Haha, funny you say that Joey.  I was just telling my buddies here at work that I wish I was still there.  Thanks again Chris for the invite, I enjoyed the trip with ya and would do it again anytime, of course as long as the wife ok's it.   With the techniques we used, I can only imagine how good the fishing would be in the summer."
