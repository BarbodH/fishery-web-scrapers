251871,Minnow,2008-09-22 19:51:00,177,"Hey Guys  Headed out to Simcoe a couple of times in September and here are some the Smallies I was able to hook into. All fish were caught between 20-30 FOW and most came on tubes while a couple on the drop shot rig! Lost some real giants but got a 6 lber and am looking on hooking into a 7 lber before the season ends. They seem to be on the fall pattern already but have been hard to locate schools of big ones, catch a couple but never more then 2 or 3. I have been able to catch boat loads on 2 lbers which are still lots of fun. Here are some of the smallies caught  Here is a 4lber I got on the Drop Shot    Here is 5.5 Lber I caught dragging a tube    Here is 5 Lbs Bass my friend caught, his PB Smallie    Here is the 6 lb 2 oz giant (He might be a 7 lber in November)  "

252147,steverowbotham,2008-09-23 19:51:00,1800," Drop shot is a weight on the bottom of your rig, with the hook up the line (generally 10-20 inches) .... it helps you maintain bottom contact, while still keeping your bait in the strike zone, its a very effective way of fishing"
252154,tibbs,2008-09-23 20:07:00,650,WOW!  Those are some massive fish!
