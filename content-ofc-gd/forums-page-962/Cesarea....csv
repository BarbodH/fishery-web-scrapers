252254,Beans,2008-09-24 01:30:00,3339,There are a few of us in the Lindsay/Peterborough area and further north in the Kawarthas...  I'm about an hour from there...
252296,Sinker,2008-09-24 03:34:00,8692,"I""m about 20 mins from there.......  Sinker"
252416,lookinforwalleye,2008-09-24 19:11:00,4399,"Thanks Sinker, I think I am getting closer to my dream of owning a waterfront home, the thing that has held me back in the last few years is the 3 man children I still have living at home but I am getting closer to the time in my life that I am going to start thinking of myself for a change."
252425,jediangler,2008-09-24 19:39:00,1923,You could probably get the properties next to the bikers at the launch ramp for cheap.
252471,spooner_jr,2008-09-24 21:33:00,193,"I'm in Port, let me know if you have any questions about the area."
252498,lookinforwalleye,2008-09-24 23:48:00,4399,  tell me more!
252581,jediangler,2008-09-25 12:02:00,1923,"I think they are on the right side as you approach the launch. During the summer they gather in numbers for suds and smoke. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but you might not want the language and late parties right next door."
