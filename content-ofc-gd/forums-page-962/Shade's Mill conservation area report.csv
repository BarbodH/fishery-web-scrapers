When we arrived we found that a large number of people were there for a company party. They had a big tent with a live jazz band playing. It was pretty cool fishing with the music loud enough we could hear it all over the lake. I took the kayak and Shipper took his Sportspal. The weeds are on the decline now, so we could fish almost everywhere. I caught 3 crappies, 2 rockbass and a baby largemouth all on jigs. The Shipper caught a stick, with a bobber on it. The bobber still had line and a hook, on the hook was a good sized catfish. He wanted to know if that counts as a landed fish. I said ""you landed it, so it counts"".  I had to unhook it because he was afraid having never handled a cat this size. It swam away slowly but surely. We saw 3 other boats on the water including a bass boat with a 90hp outboard that was jacked up out of the water (no gas motors policy). A few shore fishers, mostly families with young kids, were catching bluegills and rockbass. Nice day to be on the water."

252073,joonmoon,2008-09-23 14:08:00,528,"Good stuff bro, leave it to the shipper to catch and land a caught helpless cat....lol. Good on ya fur releasing it unharmed. It sure was a beauty day to be out. Hit the Grand and the Speed after niteshift for the day Monday and picked up a handfull of small bass. They were both high and murkier than normal, tough fishin."

252143,pokerdemon4,2008-09-23 19:27:00,135,"That picture is priceless.  At least the catfish swam away.  At least he caught something.  I would let it count too.  Thanks for posting,  I found it very amusing."
252150,cplummer,2008-09-23 20:03:00,165,well.. i say he owns at least  1/2 of that catfish!!
