252307,steverowbotham,2008-09-24 05:10:00,1800,"Thanks guys, I didnt realize I had a fan base ... LOL  It was a pretty awesome year, I was about to post a report, but I guess I'll do it here.  Our club has a 4 fish limit, which is different from most clubs (most have 5).  We have 4 per person, which makes a team limit of 8 fish.  We fish 6 qualifying tournaments and take our top 4 for Angler of the Year standings. Our membership stands at 58 members.  Here are my best 4 from the season...  July 9, 2008 Lake Simcoe - Afternoon Tournament  It was a really tough day, it was windy as could be, and I had already weighed in early from a completely seperate tournament to make it on time for this one.  With 6 footers out on the lake, our best bet was to find shelter.  I was lucky enough to be paired with my dad by random draw.  We started off fishing some marinas for largemouth and my dad managed to boat a limit of small largies, but I wasnt having much luck (the difference between braid and fluoro).  I ended up seeking shelter in a bay near Roches Point that had done well for me in the past.  There were some giant smallies taking advantage of the rock bass spawn, but I lost my first 3 fish on a jerkbait.  I finally switched to a spinnerbait, knowing I wouldnt get as many bites, but I'd land the vast majority of them.  I landed 5 fish and weighed my biggest 4 at 9.50 pounds to take 5th place on a very tough day!!!    August 13, 2008 Lake Couchiching - Afternoon Tournament  I was paired with a new member today and my gameplan was different than most days.  I used to do a lot of dock fishing on Cooch, but they have started to receive a lot of pressure and now hold a lot of smaller fish.  My new plan involved deep weedlines.  Both of us caught plenty of fish today dunking a 10 inch powerworm in deep milfoil beds, and throwing flukes over the more scattered weeds.  I weighed my biggest 4 fish for 13.55 pounds for a first place finish, also had BIG FISH with a 4.40 pound largie.    August 17, 2008 Six Mile Lake - Full day tournament  This is one of my favourite lakes to fish, there are a ton of fish and they are scrappy as can be.  I spent WAY too much time fishing shallow today, and although I had a quick limit, they were not big fish by any means.  Finally in the last 2 hours I found better fish in 15 feet of water, dunking a 5"" craw in deep weeds.  I landed a better fish, then broke my 6 foot rod.  I quickly changed my reel over to a 7 foot rod and lost 5 FISH IN A ROW!!!!!!  That damn rod.  I was dissapointed with my day coming into weigh-in, but it was a tough day for all and I managed 7th place with 7.85 pounds.    September 21, 2008 Lake Muskoka - Full day tournament  I worked until 2:30am in Lindsay, and I just drove right through to Lake Muskoka on no sleep.  I had a fall plan and only managed to catch small fish, so I went to a back up plan that gave me a 3rd place finish here last year.  I was in 6th place for AOY going into this final tournament and needed 3rd or better, and the guy in #1 needed 6th or worse for me to win.  My backup plan worked .... I was throwing flukes over rockpiles in 8-10 feet of water and landed two beauties over 4 pounds, 1 was almost 5.  My others were 2.5 ish.  I came into weigh-in knowing I'd done my part.  Winning weight here for our clubbies is usually 10-11 pounds (remember its only 4 fish) and I knew I had at least 13.  Our leader had about 8 pounds and I knew it was going to be CLOSE!!!!  He finished 8th, and I finished first with 13.85 pounds giving me the tournament and AOY win!!! On a side note for excitement, my dad weighed in a 6.15 pound largemouth out of Muskoka!!! He took big fish for the year, and qualified for our classic!!!   my dad's PIG!!!   A couple of my winning fish!"
