I have never targeted northerns or most other fish in this time of the season because hunting season has started (bear, grouse, moose, and then deer)  so no time for fishing  So i am trying to be led in the right direction.  Question:  Where would i start to find pike...not hammer handles, but pike...big, mean and angry?  Thanks a million."
251858,Raf,2008-09-22 19:04:00,3495,"In main lake areas.  Deep weedlines, shoals.. near deep water, rocks and weeds.   If there is a population of walleye, cisco, lake trout in the lake.. I'd be fishing near them.  Trolling is an effective way to get them, don't be afraid to smash bottom with big lures."
251869,Reef Runner,2008-09-22 19:36:00,980,"I would second trolling deep for them, especally in shield-type lakes.  Stick to the areas Raf's mentioned.  Big countdowns, heavy daredevils spoons maybe behind a dipsy should work."
