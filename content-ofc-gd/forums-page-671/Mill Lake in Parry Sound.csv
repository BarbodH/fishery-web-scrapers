475997,LegitFish,2010-06-15 16:13:00,69,"I know a friend who went to a resort there. He said there was a ton of bass, some pike, but he didn't manage to catch any muskie."
476003,alexcba,2010-06-15 16:18:00,634,"a friend of mine mentioned he'd been up there before.. said the fishing was decent, he caught his first splake there.. heres a link http://www.milllakecottageresort.com/  legit there arent any muskie in there.."
476007,Headhunter,2010-06-15 16:36:00,5703,"My wife's cousin built a cottage on the first island that can be seen from hwy 69. There are pike, bass and yes, the elusive pickereye in there. Alot of structure in the water in and around the islands, some humps that come out of deep water and some open flats that hold some pretty nice pickereye that no one fishes for. Had some decent luck trolling planer boards for pickereyes, you woun't have a problem finding the shoals as that's where all the other boats are fishin. You can order a pizza from Pizza Hut and they will deliver to the town dock! Civilized I'd say! LOL PM me if you need more! HH"
476095,Musky or Specks,2010-06-15 21:41:00,2710,I think your thinking of Mill Lake off of Beaverstone Channel
476099,smally21,2010-06-15 21:48:00,993,"what i notice about fishing the smaller lakes around parry sound is the fish act the way the manual says.  fish the way the magazine article said and you'll do well.  there are bass and pike in the weedbeds, and smallies congregate around dropoffs behind points and islands and you can do well with jigs with live or artificial baits.  really nice area i remind myself to do some boating as well as fishing when i am there."
476107,LegitFish,2010-06-15 22:31:00,69, You may be right... All I can remember him telling me was mill lake.
