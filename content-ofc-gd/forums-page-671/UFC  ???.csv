475205,misfish,2010-06-13 03:33:00,29133,Another YAWWWWWWNER
475209,Paully,2010-06-13 03:39:00,712, More action at the local bar..
475220,misfish,2010-06-13 04:14:00,29133," My thoughts aswell. Crocop did it old school.Great fight.Take it,and give it at the end."
475224,misfish,2010-06-13 04:34:00,29133,That was a crazy knock out.  Chuck is done.
475236,Cudz,2010-06-13 05:21:00,2652,I beg to differ about it being a yawner.  I thought all the fights were very good.  Not too many people gassing tonight and some great back and forth action with a few nice subs and a big KO just for fun.  In my opinion this card exceeded my espectations.  Cro Cop looked like pride Cro Cop. Chuck is not not done.  He was done about 5 fights ago.
475272,bullybass,2010-06-13 13:54:00,144,I thought the fights were good too. I think that Pat Barry may have hurt his right hand on one of the first round knockdowns to Cro Cop as he never really threw it again and gave him way too much room. If you knock someone down like that finish it... just saying... you don't hug it out and high five. Franklin would have been done if Liddell landed that last right as he was rocked a couple of times. Amazing however to win a fight where you broke your arm!!! That's a really tough dude. Unfortunate for Chuck but I agree he probably shouldn't have been in the ring. Although I would have liked to see him fight Tito!!
475278,chessy,2010-06-13 14:32:00,610,amazing that franklin won with a broken arm chuck broke it with a leg kick. chucks only problem is he chased franklin ..
475369,Terry,2010-06-13 20:50:00,14456,I thought most of the fights were great....
475379,Gerritt,2010-06-13 21:06:00,6129,I thought that me not having to shell our 50.00 was even better
475381,bassman87,2010-06-13 21:08:00,586,"cant complain, you didnt pay for it"
475385,misfish,2010-06-13 21:17:00,29133," True,but Im not for the clinch game.Stand up and ground and pound.  Best fight was the Crocop/Pat. Could do without the hugs and kiss,s."
475391,bassman87,2010-06-13 21:32:00,586, lol well said
475403,richyb,2010-06-13 22:02:00,774,Rory MacDonald looked very good for a young kid. I also liked Dunhams performance. I think Rothwell and Yvel should have only had to fight 1 round because there wasnt much goin on in the other 2.
