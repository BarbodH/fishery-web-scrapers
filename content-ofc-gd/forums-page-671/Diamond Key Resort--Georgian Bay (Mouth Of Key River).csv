I am not familiar with this camp, though I have fished nearby Georgian Bay Fishing Camp for years. He is specifically interested in the walleye and pike fishing there, as well as impressions of the camp from folks who have stayed there. Their website is impressive for sure... Thanks to all who respond."

I would say, you definetly would enjoy the place, fish or no fish. Working on getting back there, but I'm biased."
