475152,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-06-12 23:10:00,1107,LOL  To the OP nice musky you did the best you could with what you had hopefully the fish survived and you now know you were a bit under prepared for the beast and won't do it next time I am scared to go for ski's cause I will prolly be hooked after the first 1 I have only ever had 1 on and didn't land it while pike fishing I'm sure this won't be your last musky post.
475156,irishfield,2010-06-12 23:15:00,26272,"Great stuff Instructor!!!!  ..to the others, it's a fish... get over it !"
475157,Sandbag,2010-06-12 23:20:00,533,  That's solid right there.  Nice Ron..  Cheers  Craig
475160,lew,2010-06-12 23:33:00,12766,"Nice fish Instructor, congrats on your 1st musky."
475162,rock34,2010-06-12 23:49:00,215,Nice fish man
475163,Roy,2010-06-12 23:54:00,13728,"Good stuff, Instructor! Some people get to be wizards at telling other people how to fish. Unfortunately for them, they usually remain ""consultants"" and never really get out themselves. Don't worry about it. Go catch another, then another, then....well, you know how it goes.  But they're right about the blue seat."
475164,the-instructor,2010-06-12 23:59:00,16,"Thanks everyone for the congrats, I really appreciate it  I will be buying some proper C&R gear tomorrow morning before I head out for round 2 tomorrow night. ""Hopefully I will be able to post another good pic. This time I am taking my Cuz with me for the trip, and now I know better what to expect for one of these monsters.  Thanks again everyone.  P.S. Thanks for the offer Ron, I will probably take you up on that!"
475165,Dusky,2010-06-13 00:03:00,310,Right on.. your first musky and done solo..congratulations
475167,fishingisliving,2010-06-13 00:08:00,170,"I have a tip, get a tripod for your camera and learn to use the delay timer on your camera so you can take a nice picture of yourself holding your next musky so it's not resting on the blue chair again.  musky fishing is like heroin. The first taste is the best.. then you keep going looking for that same feeling you got when you got your first one... But thankfully with Musky as oposed to the compared substance, you DO get that feeling back when you break your PB for length and for weight class and you will make friends instead of lose them.. unless your a scots !     GO GET EM!"
475193,mistyriver1,2010-06-13 02:03:00,600,"Nice fish and congrats on your first musky.  Just to add on what a couple have said...I agree with Raf, I wouldn't bother with jawspreaders, I've got a pair in my boat and never use em.  Get yourself some knipex cutters or at least to get you started CTC usually has small bolt cutters.  For nets, since your boat is a on the smaller side, you might want to consider a Stowmaster net.  They fold nicely when not in use.  Jim"
475194,SlowPoke,2010-06-13 02:09:00,2984,Congrats on your first! Gearing up properly can be expensive; especially through trial and error! Join Muskies Canada and get out with experienced guys. It can really help making your gear decisions when you see the stuff in action.
475202,Guest gbfisher,2010-06-13 03:23:00,0,If it died. Ya coulda ate it. Looked legal.
475219,ohhenrygsr,2010-06-13 04:13:00,947, Hehehe... yea  Congrats
475251,Bly,2010-06-13 11:43:00,1556,"Congratulations on your first!  Amazing fish and as many have said, addicting.  Live, learn and enjoy, the best way to fish"
475258,the-instructor,2010-06-13 12:20:00,16,thanks again everyone for the tips and gratz. I will be heading to the shop today to pickup some proper c&r tools so I will be better prepared. Don't want no dead fish on my hands thats for sure.
475284,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-13 15:05:00,932," That's a great attitude man.  These things are a learning curve like everything else in life.  Again, congrats and keep the great reports coming (and welcome to the community)."
475289,lunkerbasshunter,2010-06-13 15:29:00,2585,"nice fish!  congrats on your first musky!  the muskie experts here are just giving you friendly advice, dont take it personally.  they do know what they are talking about.  Cheers!"
475347,bare foot wader,2010-06-13 19:41:00,1354," well said....and congrats on the first musky...  friendly FYI...posting pics on the internet is inviting everybody to congrats or criticize as they want, esp with musky and steelies, posting those pics draws a ton of attention....take it with a grain of salt...even the ones ""criticizing"" you did have good points about proper C&R that shouldn't be ignored..."
475349,pikeguy,2010-06-13 19:43:00,195,     here here
475374,Handlebarz,2010-06-13 20:56:00,3790,Nice musky and to think you have many more to get as for the release we were all there when we started and you will find alot of help here this is where it all started for me and some of the guys who helped me along the way are doing the same for you.  Congrats and if yer ever down by Lake St.Clair look me up we will get out if I am around when you are down here. As for that Ron guy he Ok and might know something or at least he will get the fish to go to the other boats in the area but you will be right there to take the pics.
475414,houski,2010-06-13 22:41:00,61,"Nice fish man! The first muskie always sticks in your mind. Mine was only 34.5'', and I caught it while fishing bass. It's pretty sweet to catch your first actually targeting the species. Looks like a decent one too (42''...ish?).  I would spool up with 80 lb. braid, this helps you to get your fish in quickly. Even on big fish, my fights usually only last about 30 seconds or so. Also, at the bare minimum, you should have a muskie sized net, or large cradle, long pliers, and good mini bolt cutters.  These days my fish are only out of the water for a quick measurement, and photo. Then back they go. However, I'm sure I killed a fish or two unintentionally when I was staring out. Don't sweat it, just make sure that you're well prepared. For such a large mean fish, they're surprisingly fragile.  Again, way to go man. Keep the photos coming."
475472,Fishing 24/7,2010-06-14 01:10:00,709,awesome musky.   and like you said.   i dont care who you are.   to EVERY musky fisherman on this site and on ANY site.  think about you first big musky.   yeah thats what.   now hang you head in shame.
475567,the-instructor,2010-06-14 13:48:00,16,well yesterday on stoney lake was not a complete waste but no muskies on our lines. Although I did go out and buy a 'huge net and 3 long pliars bolt cutters aswell.	We only had one chaser... But was still exciting.
475052,the-instructor,2010-06-12 16:43:00,16,"Ok so here is my story... I been fishing since I was a kid like most but only recently (I am 27 now) I started taking fishing alot more seriously. I just purchased my first bait caster and equipped myself with what I believe to be some good muskie lures based on the hours and hours of reading I have done. Btw, I bought a 7' shimano compre with a shimano citica 200E equipped with 20lbs power pro braided line and a 75lbs 12"" titanium leader. I was using a large Jitter bug (frog colors) with the jointed ass end.  I was fishing on Big Cedar lake which is right near stoney lake. Fist time heading out to target muskie. Hit the water at 7:30ish and decided to hit one of the bays which I thought could be holding a fish. Keep in mind I have no fish finder. Conditions where nice, sun from the west but was being shaded by a talltree line, winds was blowing soft bu't from the south so I was pretty sheltered. Water was warm, prolly 70's? not to sure. Prtty glassy aswell.  30-40 casts and bingo! Huge fish flying out of the water, my heart was racing like never before. He had completely comped on this bait  I gave a good firm hook set and the fight was on. About 35-40 min later and 3 flipping jumps out of the water I finally was able to grab him/her. Was a successful release ( i was trying to be VERY careful ) took a bit to revive. I was all alone so this was the best I could do for a pic, and he ripped a hole in my old crappy net LOL.  I will never forget this fight and I plan to target these huge fish more often from now on. "
475054,Terry,2010-06-12 16:47:00,14456,nice you always remember your first
475056,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-12 16:56:00,3761,Awesome job man!
475061,Joey,2010-06-12 17:23:00,9122,"Well your reading paid off, very nice fish man!!  Now you need a proper net, stronger line (so the fight is not so long - better for the fish) and a few more musky safe release items and you're good to go.  Joey"
475062,fishinfool,2010-06-12 17:27:00,366," Very nice fish!! Congratulations. How wide is your boat, just to get an idea of length?"
475071,the-instructor,2010-06-12 17:48:00,16, I believe its just a normal size tin boat with a 4.5 on the back lol. its like really old but works so I can't complain and it was free  i am going to guess and say its like 4 feet wide? maybe 3.5 feet?
475073,the-instructor,2010-06-12 17:52:00,16, yeah i absolutely plan to go out and buy a nice big net some jaw spreaders and some long pliers. heavier line i most definitely going to be put on. although I feel the fight was soo long due to lack of a proper sized net and me being really nervous and excited. this fish had soooo much power it was insane. i dunno if you would want to pick up a huge musky that still had power in him  i watch fishing shows often and alot of the guys will handle fish way longer then i think they should but i never see then kill a fish. so i dunno. also he was only out of the water for like 30 seconds before being released.
475074,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-12 17:54:00,1362,"Wow....that poor Muskie almost looks dead and VERY stressed out  ....  ""About 35-40 min later and 3 flipping jumps out of the water I finally was able to grab him/her""....why did it take so long for you to reel this fish in if you were targetting Muskie to begin with????...I'm very surprised to hear that you were able to revive that fish and even if you did, the chances of that fish surviving is very LOW!!!  Get yourself some heavier line so you can keep your drag set tight without a line break-off, a GOOD Muskie net, some bolt cutters and most importantly:  If you plan on targeting Muskie then I suggest you do a lot more reading and research...I would also suggest joining a Muskie Club such as Muskies Canada so you can educate yourself a bit more..  http://www.muskiescanada.ca/"
475077,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-12 18:01:00,932,"First Off, Nice Fish!  Second Off, even after what appears to be a successful release, you often have to circle back around the area a few times to make sure the fish isn't on the surface, barely living.  Then, you'll need to spend more time reviving the fish (provided you have a net to grab it again).  It sounds to me, that despite the fact you were Musky Hunting, that you didn't really plan on catching one.  Make sure you're better equipped in the future (and it sounds like you plan on that).  Use 80 lb test.  Just remember, they're big, they're rare, and they're very fragile."
475079,the-instructor,2010-06-12 18:06:00,16," i sure the fish was stressed as any fish being caught would be, second being a smart ass on a community forum is nothing more then a self promoting ego boost. clearly it would of been nice to catch and release the fish alot quicker, but through nerves and a tough fight it took a while.  The fish swam off and seemed fine."
475082,the-instructor,2010-06-12 18:11:00,16, i spent the next hour in the same area to ensure the fish wasn't floating back to the surface.
475086,Raf,2010-06-12 18:15:00,3495,congrats on your 1st.  don't waste your time on jaw spreaders they are pretty much a useless piece of equipment when dealing with large fish.  get some quality cutters.  read the link in my signature if you want to know more about muskie c&r. there's a link under articles->muskies that you might find an interesting read too (starting muskie).
475088,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-12 18:17:00,1362," There's nothing ""smart ass"" about my reply lad.  ......I was giving you some constructive feedback based on your post and based on my experiences as being a fairly knowledgable Muskie angler..."
475092,Weeds,2010-06-12 18:29:00,782,"I'd respectfully disagree with Raf, who no doubt catches way more Musky than me. Jaw spreaders are a worthwhile investment, probably the cheapest bit of Musky gear you're likely to purchase. They make releasing the smallish guys easier and hook cutters are really no substitiute. Although I've never caught a big Musky so he may well have a point there.  Congrats on your first Musky; feels awesome eh? It's a learning curve, try and take the criticisms positively.  Oh yeah, and tape the jaw spreaders so they ain't all pointy."
475093,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-12 18:34:00,0,"WOW! What a way to break the cherry! My first musky was about 1/2 a pound.lol  I'm thinking it may have felt like 40 minutes, but I doubt it took you that long to bring it in, and it sounds like it swam away nicely.  Sounds like you have done your research and the musky guys are just trying to give you a heads up in the right direction.  Anyways congrats on your first musky, she's a beauty and thanks for sharing!"
475110,fishindude,2010-06-12 19:47:00,220,"Wow! First musky, on a topwater too! That's awesome, congrats man.  Welcome to OFC"
475112,fishinfool,2010-06-12 19:53:00,366, Well said Johnny Bass.
475113,fishinfool,2010-06-12 20:07:00,366,"I guess the first few you caught were perfect catch and release specimens too eh Troutnmuskiehunter? Not once in your post did you congratulate your fellow fisherman for catching such a nice fish. I for one came on this site to learn and share my experience with others, not just blow people out of the water with your so called awesome experience. ""sandwich a negative comment between two positive comments"" and you will go a lot further here.  Stan"
475115,fishinfool,2010-06-12 20:10:00,366," Awesome fish the-instructor!! Try not to judge this site by the negative comments you recieve because there is always someone who will crap on your glory. Again, well done and go out and get another one.  Stan"
475116,Pigeontroller,2010-06-12 20:11:00,2793,"Some good advise given! It takes some experience to successfully and quickly land and release a Muskie, especially a large one. I'd say you've got the right attitude! Nice fish and welcome to a very expensive(and rewarding)(and frustrating) hobby! If you're near Peterborough I highly recomend checking out a Kawartha Lakes Chapter(Muskies Canada) meeting, its a great way to meet other Muskie nuts and learn more about catching(and safely releasing) these amazing fish!  http://www.muskiescanada.ca/chapters/kawartha_lakes.php"
475118,Ron,2010-06-12 20:15:00,1683,"Well done Instructor!  No criticism here on this end. I find it ironic that the critics here give advice but none of them offer the best piece of advice. That advice would be to go out with anonther muskie nut. So here is my offer for advice.... If you ever want to go out muskie fishing and learn a few different techniques and hopefully some C&R methods, send me a PM and we will try to set something up. I won't be able to get you out until some time in mid July though.  Cheers, Ron..."
