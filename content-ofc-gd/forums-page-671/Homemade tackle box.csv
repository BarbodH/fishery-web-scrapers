475558,wankerjohn123,2010-06-14 13:27:00,117,Awesome...  A file folder box from Staples?
475560,SlowPoke,2010-06-14 13:30:00,2984," Looking good but here's a thought. You should have left over material, enough for 10 2"" sections... stagger the tubes and use the 2"" sections as spacers. Use the left over tubes to make a third row.  tube - spacer - tube - spacer - tube spacer - tube - spacer - tube - spacer tube - spacer - tube - spacer - tube"

475741,chong,2010-06-14 21:21:00,102,"  Got the box at Staples,it was on clearance for $2.00    I thought about making it that way but didn't have enough surface to glue the tubing together.I kept some space to store pliers,gloves and other stuff."
