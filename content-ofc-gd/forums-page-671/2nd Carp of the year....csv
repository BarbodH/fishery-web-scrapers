The one I landed though was pretty nice, I think 33.5"" length by 25"" girth.  I figure it weighed somewhere around 25 lbs?  Wish I had put something in the frame to give it a sense of scale... I caught one slightly longer last year but this fish is WAY thicker, so I'm calling it my new PB carp! Looking forward to getting out again in a week or two. Mike"
