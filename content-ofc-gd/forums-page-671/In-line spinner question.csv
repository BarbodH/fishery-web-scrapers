475691,singingdog,2010-06-14 19:11:00,1047,"OK, this is for you lure makers. I have been making my own in-line spinners for musky. I ran out of the right size clevis (clevii?) and built one with the blade mounted straight on the wire. It seems to work just fine...spins as easily as the ones I that I have built with a clevis. Is there a reason that no-one builds them this way? If they work just as well, it seems like a way to skip a finicky piece, and a step in the lure-making process."
475697,Roy,2010-06-14 19:24:00,13728," What he said. You can probably get away with that on small blades such as Panther Martin does.  And BTW, the plural of clevis is clevises. I know this because it's in the dictionary just after cleavage/cleavages."
475754,singingdog,2010-06-14 22:06:00,1047,"Thanks. It's a .51 wire, so it will probably stand-up for awhile. Time to order some clevises I guess."
475773,douG,2010-06-14 23:06:00,2693,"I am going to order some cleavages, if it's all the same to you."
475805,bare foot wader,2010-06-15 00:01:00,1354,"i've been making spinners for quite a few years now for steelies, bass, pike and a few musky bucktails and don't necessarily agree that it will weaken the wire...aka not at all in any of my experience...I've never had an issues and look at a mepps xp or a panther martin...shaft through blade design and no issues for years with either of those models  IMO a clevis will allow the blade to spin with less force and it will put out a bit more vibration than a shaft through blade design...but you'll only notice that on smaller spinners...far less impact on a musky sized spinner"
475908,singingdog,2010-06-15 09:19:00,1047," Thanks. I was worried about it being harder to spin, but I don't notice a difference when testing them side-by-side with the clevised spinners I have made."
475917,Moosebunk,2010-06-15 10:38:00,3970, If you're paying I'll take some off ya as well.  Cleavages are a great lure.
