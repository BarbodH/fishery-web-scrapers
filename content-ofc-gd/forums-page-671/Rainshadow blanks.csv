So far I think I like the Rainshadow blanks, they sound great and the price point is looking good too. Of course the St.Croix I am familiar with but I want to try something different. What I want to build is few good rods for bass and pike fishing. Any feedback on Rainshadow or Lamiglass blanks for this application. I'm sure there are a few OFNers who use them. Or is there any other blank I should consider?  As far as components go, Ill deal with that later, blanks first. Cheers"
