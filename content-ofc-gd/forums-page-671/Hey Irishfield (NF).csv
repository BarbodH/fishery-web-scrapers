I have been up a few times in a Beaver but it wasn't near this size. I also wonder what the wheel in between the seats is that the pilot is adjusting all the time. Went up in a Beaver at Beaverland (go figure lol) a few years ago and when we were coming in to land on the lake, the pilot came over the tree line real low to get on the lake and the plane dropped about ten feet real fast. The pilot was quick to adjust that wheel between the seats and go back up and come around for a second attempt. Me, I just wanted to get back to the cabin to change my gotch. haha."
475297,irishfield,2010-06-13 15:49:00,26272,It's a Turbo Otter Stan. Built in 1960.. so it would have originally had a radial engine on the front. Suspect it's a Vazar conversion to the turbo prop engine since this one has a Pratt & Whitney PT6A-135 in it and it was probably done in the early 1990's.  .. It'll go where ever a Beaver will (and possibly then some)... and at a gross weight of just shy of 8000 lbs. I wouldn't want to fuel that 750HP.. maintain it or pay the insurance on that beast!

It took me most of my younger years to learn the makes and models of all the cars out there and what engine options were available. Too late to start with the planes too. lol  Thanks again."
475348,irishfield,2010-06-13 19:41:00,26272,Guess you wouldn't want to go for a ride in my 1946 Piper J3 cub.....   ..oh and that Beaver you rode in was probably older than the Otter in Eddies adventure pictures...
475357,fishinfool,2010-06-13 20:16:00,366," Hard to believe, and yeah if that Piper is the one in the classifieds lol, I think i'll get ya next time haha."
475359,irishfield,2010-06-13 20:19:00,26272,Safest way to travel Stan... don't ever forget that!

475362,irishfield,2010-06-13 20:27:00,26272,I'm sure someone saw daylight for the first time....
