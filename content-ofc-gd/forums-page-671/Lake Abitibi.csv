475280,CementCarver,2010-06-13 14:47:00,4,Thanks for allowing me to enter into your forum webpage.  A group of us are heading to Lake Abitibi at the beginning of July. We've heard of the large pickerel and pike fish in this lake. But we've also heard that the water is somewhat stained in colour.  Can anyone recommend what type of gear/setup we need to use to fish this lake? Is trolling better than still fishing with live baits?  I appreciate any help you can add.....  Thx..CementCarver
475291,lunkerbasshunter,2010-06-13 15:32:00,2585,my inlaws fish this lake a couple times a year.  They catch walleye on worm harnesses.  It works for them when they go up there so they have never used anything else  good luck!  Cheers!
475325,Billy Bob,2010-06-13 17:58:00,5865,If this is the lake I am thinking about which is also referred to as Aba and you need to fly in from Nakina then just 1/8 or 1/4oz all black bucktail jigs or black twister tails will  catch all the walleye you will ever want....we had 8 guys and caught 1080 walleyes plus 243 pike over a 7 day stay.
475346,bare foot wader,2010-06-13 19:33:00,1354,"water is stained/murky....jigs and grubs or tipped with a minnow...slip float with bait...worm harnesses...williams spoons are effective....very shallow lake, 6-8 fow on average, deepest if you can find it is maybe 15....  lake is rough and can change very quickly, be smart and don't stay out, you WILL bottom out between big swells when it's rough  IMO it's more of a fish factory than a trophy lake for the eyes...monster pike for sure!...but eyes have been more numbers than size, lots up to 5 lbs, anything after that is a good fish....nothing bigger than 10lbs that we've seen personally....sauger, perch and ling as well"
