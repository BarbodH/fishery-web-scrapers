475451,Cudz,2010-06-14 00:16:00,2652,"lots of diesel bmw.  That 3 liter has crazy torque.  Almost keeps up with the 335i which is a twin turbo gas engine. Here are the numbers on the 3.0 they finally decided to put into the 3 series, 5 series and X5. the 3.0-liter I-6 diesel makes a truly impressive 265 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque Those are sick numbers and they claim 35 mpg on hwy."
475452,irishfield,2010-06-14 00:17:00,26272,Was gonna say Cudz.. beamer's been making diesels for almost 30 years.
475468,alexcba,2010-06-14 00:59:00,634,"yep they have been around forever in europe, the ones here as cuds mentioned have some sick power."
475651,fish-miester,2010-06-14 16:56:00,864,hmm thats pretty cool.. but when I started reading I was waiting to read that it wasnt a diesel car and she was trying to get back at her husband or sumthing!
475659,walleyemen,2010-06-14 17:10:00,316,"I thought it was cool, never seen one here,and i've been a diesel maechanic for 20 years, you learn something new everyday LOL!"
475786,Cudz,2010-06-14 23:27:00,2652,"Most cars in Europe are diesel and this includes Hondas as well.  Even the civics are diesel, lots of torque and insane fuel economy.  I was in England this Christmas and I rented an audi a4 station wagon.  It had a 2.o tdi with an 8 speed auto tranny (yep you read that right 8 speed).  I was travellin at 120 kph and rpm was about 1950.  Not bad for a 4 cylinder!"
