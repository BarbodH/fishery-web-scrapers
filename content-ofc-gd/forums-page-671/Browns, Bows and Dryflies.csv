Whatever they were they were too small to see on the water.  We did still manage to get into a good number of fish. A few decent sized brookies that let go before they posed for us. But a nice brown and a nice rainbow to hand anyways.  We also ran into Doug Swift out there today. Cool dude for sure!  These guys were on big old stimulators worked pretty aggressively in the fast water        Good times!"
