But Liza Vandermeer won't be surprised if it returns this year.  Vandermeer, issue and project co-ordinator with the Ministry of the Environment for the Northern Region, says several factors sparked the problem.   It's a shallow body of water. It's sheltered. There's little outflow,"" Vandermeer said, hours after almost 100 people turned out to a recent public presentation in Callander on the issue.  Every year, we're seeing more incidents,"" Vandermeer said.  But at the same time, she points out that blue-green algae has been with us almost forever,"" which begs the question: Are there more blooms, or are people just more aware of them?  It could be public awareness. There is more media coverage, so more people know about it.""  While it is impossible to make an accurate prediction about what might happen this summer, the elements are lining up in favour of another bloom.  There has been low precipitation this year and high temperatures,"" she points out.  Blue-green algae are microscopic plants that, despite their name, can range in colour from olive-green to red.  Although not necessarily dangerous, they can contain toxins harmful to humans or animals.  The blooms, such as the one that formed in Callander Bay last summer, tend to form late in the summer or in the early fall, after the water bodies warm up. That, combined with lower water levels and higher atmospheric temperatures increases the possibility of another bloom,"" Vandermeer said.  She pointed out that, like any natural phenomena, it is usually two steps ahead of any human measures"" to deal with it.  The bay was posted with signs from the North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit on Aug. 13 last year. The signs stayed up until the fall.  When he first saw it, Kevin Buck, supervisor for the MoE's northern region, said he thought someone had spilled paint in the water.  Dan Walters, of the department of geography at Nipissing University, said Callander Bay is not the only waterway in the area with a problem. Cache Bay is also susceptible to blooms of blue-green algae.  There's no quick fix,"" Vandermeer said.  She urges anyone who sees something unusual on the water to contact the ministry so testing can be done.  [emailÂ protected]"
