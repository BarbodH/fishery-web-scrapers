474920,Fish Farmer,2010-06-12 01:42:00,2234,"My buddy and myself headed to Maitland yesterday. No minnows to be had in Dunnville. Good job I took a few frozen minnows from home. We fished the end of the pier but nada, so we head east. We stopped a few places, still nada. Boated into Mohawk Marine, he had Minnows. Back out on the lake we headed east from there, what a boat ride. We ended almost 12 miles east of Maitland 52 FTW. We hit the honey hole, 1, 2 at a time, none stop action. Just hit the bottom and fish on. My buddy said he never seen fishing like it. We had to keep every fish because they blow there stomach. We got lots of jumbos and some small ones thrown in. Man what a day!! The lake started to blow, the long 2 hour run back to maitland against  2 to 3 foot waves.  Biggest Perch was 13 1/4""     Chris (Spiel) the Rod worked great, it never let me down buddy ;D     "
