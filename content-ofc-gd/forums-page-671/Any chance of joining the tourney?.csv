475389,Daplumma,2010-06-13 21:27:00,1961,"The online one.I know that they have to add people when there is enough for each team to have one person added at the same time.Art may be interested also. The Crayola ....I'm in!I think it may be my year,had a few top 5 finishes but the trophy has escaped me for some reason. Joe"
