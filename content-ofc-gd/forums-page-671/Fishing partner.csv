474986,Big Cliff,2010-06-12 11:51:00,6899, Well Peter forgive me if I missed it but I couldn't find any introduction from you or anything to tell me what you like to fish for or anything else about you. A bit of background might help get you a few more replies. Having some things in common with a person you are going to spend a day with on the water can make a big difference in how a day goes!

But welcome to the board peter, you will find there is not only fishing partners here but a great community of people where one can learn alot. I am fairly new myself."
