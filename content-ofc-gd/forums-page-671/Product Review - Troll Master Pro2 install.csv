The most difficult part was running the wire from the motor to the console thru the gunwales. The only beef I have is the throttle rod that you have to install (after removing the original to allow the servo full control) had the loop made too wide and it fell off every time I cycled the control servo. A couple pinches with a pair of pliers fixed that, after resetting the stroke, but it's the only thing that the manufacture need to correct in what they are selling.  Issue I had with my boat was on any major turn the cable length would change the idle setting and screw up your trolling speed. Throttle cable slop and not wanting to play with the throttle once under way negated using those throttle busts and idle ""games"" to get lakers to commit.  The troll control is a gem (I've already used it on Lloyd's boat)... set your speed... push a button for full throttle.. let go and the unit returns you to exactly the same speed. Get a fish on.. hit idle and the boat stays in gear but goes to factory idle setting while you fight the fish.  Can't wait to put it in action...  The only thing I would change if I was making the product... the power connection would be at the motor end of the cable, so that you could move the control head around in the boat. Would be nice to have it so you could move it depending on what and how you were fishing.   "

475392,glen,2010-06-13 21:34:00,2641,Looks good. I would like that on my boat.  My throttle is hard to control too.
475395,corvette1,2010-06-13 21:40:00,1765,sounds good wayne you will like it i had that on my tr-1 speed plus auto pilot
475397,Roy,2010-06-13 21:43:00,13728,Yeah I saw Lloyd's in action....works great!
475398,irishfield,2010-06-13 21:50:00,26272,.. just realized.. you can also see where I keep track of oil changes. Habit... I do the same on airplane filters and engine cases.
475465,Cudz,2010-06-14 00:56:00,2652,Reminds me of Perfect Pass for water skiing and wakeboarding.  Dial in the speed and it holds there.
476016,irishfield,2010-06-15 17:15:00,26272,Thought there'd be a little more interest in this.. I'll bump it once and then just shut up !
476021,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-15 17:30:00,2690,"Yeah, saw it on Lloyd's boat, that is a sweet item to have.  Have fun with it Wayne!!!!!!"
