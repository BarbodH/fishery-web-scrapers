475585,Dara,2010-06-14 14:41:00,3052,"I ended up with a St Croix baitcast rod. Somebody broke my spinning rod and replaced it with a baitcaster. It is a med light fast 6'6 1 pc premier. They tossed the tags so it is unreturnable. I figure I may as well make use of it. In the $80.00 range what reel could I put on this. I fish walleyes generally and some speckleds and lakers, and perch. Ideas?"

It's gear-ratio is perfect for spoons and crankbaits.  Your ""target"" species of fish are pretty spread out and the citica is a versatile reel.  Ryan"
