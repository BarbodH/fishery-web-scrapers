One of my daughters didn't go to Uni; but she has made a name for herself in advertising notably with  CT and Bell. Irish, what ever they do, we should be proud of them. But an accomplishment such as hers is great. Hope you are passing on your great skills. I know I have at least with one of them; I have four!   A"
475139,nofish4me,2010-06-12 21:58:00,404,"Wayne,congratulations.I've been there and this sound came to mind.Thumping Chest"
475141,irishfield,2010-06-12 22:10:00,26272," Na.. this kids got me beat Ketch, but you are right... whether they go post secondary or work at McDonald's there is something in each and everyone of them that we should be proud of! Not sure where she got it from.... Desk she built her mother in Grade 10 or 11.. and some other furniture she's thrown together. She paints pretty good toooo... She has an eye for detail that I'll never have!      "
475145,vinnimon,2010-06-12 22:43:00,2593,Congrats Irish
475177,irishfield,2010-06-13 00:37:00,26272," LOL Goran ! Andrea sure did get the short end there!  If you look close in the pictures...  you'll see that Kristal is wearing my engineering ring on her thumb. I was totally unaware of it until we were on the drive home, but I guess she grabbed mine because her Aunt Wendy's didn't fit any of her fingers. Her Aunt (my youngest sister that passed last summer) pushed her way into a ""man's world"" in 1978 and got her Civil Engineering Degree from Carleton.. so Kristal felt she was walking in her Aunt's foot steps and wanted her there with her when she received her degree ..."
475186,kickingfrog,2010-06-13 00:57:00,8333,You have every right to be proud Wayne.  and you don't clean-up half bad.   I wonder what the the next 20 odd years will bring for us and Ryan.
475226,corvette1,2010-06-13 04:38:00,1765,congrats to you and your wife thats a proud day for all three of you
475430,camillj,2010-06-13 23:32:00,1988,Congrats Wayne !  My oldest left on a plane for Bermuda today ... and while I am so proud of her (she finished her degree in Biology and Psychology and landed herself a job at Dolphin Quest chasing her dream) ... I fear it has ripped a big hole in my heart ...they grow up just a little too fast ...
475431,irishfield,2010-06-13 23:34:00,26272,But such a great place to go visit her Jon !! lol
475432,Bly,2010-06-13 23:34:00,1556,congrats to all!   I hope to some day be able to share similar photos with my girls
475571,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-14 14:00:00,1183,congrats to your youngest - well done! But 90K...WOW!!  I sponsored a girl from Germany a few years ago who came to complete her Grade 11 in Canada.  She came for a visit last summer and was telling me that they don't have to pay for University in Germany.  Too bad it couldn't be that way here.
475608,Whopper,2010-06-14 15:36:00,2174,Congrats to your daughter and mom/dad
475616,Headhunter,2010-06-14 15:50:00,5703,Congrats buddy! Think of it this way... they are all working and now are restricted to vacation time to get up to the cottage so that means just the two of you for the summer... I hope you guys enjoy and I wish your daughter good fortune in her career! HH
474908,irishfield,2010-06-12 01:24:00,26272,"On Thursday morning our youngest officially received her Bachelor of Architecture degree, with Distinction, from Carleton University in Ottawa. Four long hard years for her with minimal social life (anyone that's done arch knows what I mean), and Dad's pocket about $90k lighter!  Watching her walk across the stage yesterday... the expense slipped our minds for a short moment while we beamed ear to ear!  The youngest of all the Grandchildren and the only one's graduation that Mom missed, but my Step father did a great job of sitting in and giving her the necklace that Mom had already purchased before she passed last year.  She worked hard to achieve this degree and had four firms negotiating for her to work for them after seeing her capabilities that she presented in her portfolio. She is currently employeed by an Architectural firm in Barrie and is working for a year to get practical experience before going back to get her Masters.  Man.. where do the years go??!  "

474979,DanD,2010-06-12 11:11:00,2223,"Congratulations to your daughter Wayne; something to be proud of for sure.  Andy my youngest has just graduated with his Bachelor of Engineering; went to his grad last weekend. He was picked up by General Dynamics in the tank division, here in London. He almost lost out on the job; not due to his credentials but because of his chest size. 2 inches bigger he wouldn’t have fit inside the tank’s hatches. That’s one off the books; Michelle my oldest has 2 more years of law in Ottawa to go. I’ve already started window shopping for my new boat. LOL Can’t remember what it’s like not paying tuition? It’ll be 12 years worth between the two kids; worth every cent when you see them succeed. But if either one says Masters; I think I’ll crap my pants. LOL  Dan.  My two kids; well they're still kids to me. "
474984,Fisherman,2010-06-12 11:43:00,7201,"Well Wayne, with those smiles, there's no words needed, it's good to see some of the young folk making good and congrats to the parents for their efforts."
474989,Bernie,2010-06-12 12:00:00,3190,Her dedication to do what she has accomplished is not easy. Well done! And good for you and Leah to raise a daughter with the will and determination to do it. Congratulations to you all.

474998,Handlebarz,2010-06-12 13:06:00,3790,Awesome Wayne and Congratz to her just think now that she is done you will have extra time for more fishing less work and maybe even some extra $$$ for a new boat or some other thing you might just need.
474999,Uncle Buck,2010-06-12 13:08:00,1000,"Congrats...  I still feel we shouldn't be educating women...  you should she Andrea's face when i say that... Priceless  she's a nurse, i'm a tool and die maker   oh well, i'm marrying well, she's not"

475048,irishfield,2010-06-12 15:54:00,26272," Congrats to you and yours Dan !!!  I have 13 years of University tuition/rent/etc into my three and it will be nice to get a break.. even if it is for just a year. She's already applied to do her Masters at a few schools (deadline was yesterday for the fall 2011 starting year at Wat).. and is hoping she can get into Waterloo where it will not only give her a different angle on things.. it's only a year there, where as it's two every where else!"
475072,bigbuck,2010-06-12 17:49:00,2449,Wayne congratulations to your daughter!!! Thank God she gets her looks from mom!! The smile on your faces says it all. Her's for her accomplishment and yours for seeing her accomplishment. You put a lot of money into her education but it will pay off in spades during her lifetime. I don't think she'd ever forget what you did for her. Best of luck to her in all her future endeavours.
475075,Cudz,2010-06-12 17:56:00,2652,Congrats for sure.  Quick question if you don't mind.  What high school did she graduate from?
