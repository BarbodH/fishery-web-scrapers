796254,Walleye72,2013-07-03 13:24:00,156,What a Pig!! (The fish of course! LOL)  I just started to practice with my new baitcasting rig yesterday afternoon in my front yard.  I can't cast it straight. I can't cast further than 10 feet. And I still get birdnests. Gonna be a long haul. I can feel it.  I can see nine rods in that shot. Holy Moly!
796258,woodenboater,2013-07-03 13:45:00,2277,You're going to have to play around until you find the right adjustments for the cast (tension) control and the inertial (centrifugal) brakes. There are some good videos on Youtube that'll help get you on the path to fewer nests. I find heavier lures led to fewer nests.
796282,wkimwes,2013-07-03 16:30:00,76,"Other than what is stated (setting your spool tension/brakes) three things effect casting distance, Line, Lure and Rod they all should be within the range.  Meaning don't throw weightless plastics with 20lb florocarbon on a 7'6"" H/F set up.  Make sure you are within the rods limit.  Also another advice when you make your first good cast, put electrical tape on the spool...that way when you practice another cast and it backlashes, it will only backlash to that point.  Also, when I started to learn..I made a mistake a few years ago learning with a cheapo baitcaster.  That is a huge mistake, at the very least buy a Black Max Pro? or my recommendation start off  with a Bass Pro Shops Pro Qualifier reel.  That way you won't regret spending 200 on a good baitcaster if you feel baitcasters aren't for you."
