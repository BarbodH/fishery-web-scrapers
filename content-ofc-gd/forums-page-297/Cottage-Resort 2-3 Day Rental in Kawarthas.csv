I'm looking for something in the Kawarthas as it's close to his home. Cottage/cabin rental with reasonable comforts of home as he's still recovering and not ready to rough it.  Needs to have boat/motor for rent as well.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!"

I remember a couple of years ago (when I was a rookie to boating) my impeller blew on my 9.9 merc.. Troy had no problem helping me fix it and get me back on the water ASAP.  I believe their weekend rates are $110-$130 a night"

I haven't been there for a few years but the people that owned it are very nice.  There's entries in their guest book from my parents during the walleye hey days of the 50s!  Anybody been there recently?"
