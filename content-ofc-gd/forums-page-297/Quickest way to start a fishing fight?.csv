795280,danc,2013-06-28 00:58:00,4677,I do have better spots for sure. You are fishing in an aquarium (between two hydro dams) of perhaps the best trophy Brook Trout reproduction waters on the planet. Have fun and make sure you bring a bunch more people next year. Your paid for knowledge is gonna win you a bunch of new friends. I spent 30 years learning this system and you're giving it all away for a few hundred bucks spent. Nice.

People have given me knowledge on different areas before which has improved how well I did that, so I thought I would return the favour to someone else.

Learn what kind of spots/structure hold fish.... What lures work well on certain water bodies... Sometimes it's a rookie looking to fast track the learning curve of difficult fish.... Or even someone that fishes one specie and doesn't want to spend the time to learn another...  I did have 1 client openly admit to me a week after we did a trip that he booked me to find spots... And after our trip he spent 2 days trying to find my spots and catch on them with almost 0 success.... But he did say he started catching a lot more fish on spots he already knew before... This was a local angler that is retired and I have yet to see him at all... Let alone on ""my"" spots...  Just what I've seen so far..."

There's been multiple television shows filmed there as well as countless magazine articles written, some with detailed maps of hotspots included.  I fail to see how a post on a fishing forum is that big of a deal.  On the other hand I have a very good friend who lives in Thunder Bay (ironically enough also named Dan LOL!) who fishes brookies exclusively on the big lake.  I can tell you he's not very happy with the recent surge of online reports outlining precisely where guys are fishing. It's a huge sore point with him and I can understand why."

Aren't ""steelheaders"" the whiniest people on the planet about giving up locations? Yet they can come to my neck of the woods, pay for knowledge and information, and then give it all away freely? How about if I hired a guide and did some steelhead fishing down there and then sent all my buddies to his honey holes? Do you think he'd be ok with that? I could make $1000.00 bucks a weekend guiding.Tax free. I've been offered that and more. But I won't sell my locations. That's how important this fishery is to me.

795654,Ben_Daniels,2013-06-30 03:39:00,435,"I just find it ironic that you're so protective of your preferred fish and fishing area, but could care less about other people's preferred fish and where hey are."
