796752,dhickey,2013-07-06 04:37:00,1038,Would you go through a swamp in a canoe for about 1.5 hours to fish?  The other part of the question is do you have access. ?  Considering that all land around it is privately owned?  Is the swamp owned buy the land owner-s or is the water way connecting several lakes as well as swamps public domain?  Hmmm?
796754,Roy,2013-07-06 04:44:00,13728,Different rules for different waterways...just look at Scugog for example.
796757,dhickey,2013-07-06 05:22:00,1038, Agreed but Scugog is man made and water is regulated(controlled). I guess what im asking is if the water system is public once you go 3.5 hours north east of GTA?
796766,Rod Caster,2013-07-06 12:14:00,5784,"I'd try for sure (if public or have permission), I'd be mentally prepared to turn around however. Sounds like a tough tromp."
796775,Christopheraaron,2013-07-06 13:25:00,3525,"Just be careful you don't bottom out, swamps can get pretty shallow. But as for the paddle, go for it, I'd paddle 4 hours to get to good fishing!"
796820,boombap,2013-07-06 21:47:00,310,Go for it. I would also go Florida keys style and take a push pole.
796821,SirCranksalot,2013-07-06 21:52:00,3291,"Poling a canoe takes some practice. Also, the bottom in a swamp is likely to be soft and unsuitable for poling.  1 1/2 hrs?? Hell, yes, if there are fish at the other end!!"
796823,Roy,2013-07-06 21:57:00,13728, 3.5 hours north east of the GTA? What difference would that make? Toronto is not the center of the universe!
796825,spincast,2013-07-06 21:58:00,3279,"so, just out of curiosity, how did ya find out there were fish there the first time?"
796826,bobogo,2013-07-06 22:26:00,76, in terms of hockey it is!
796828,SirCranksalot,2013-07-06 22:57:00,3291,"?? Oh, udunno. When I was up the CN tower I felt dizzy---I think that was because the universe was spinning all around us!"
796831,dhickey,2013-07-06 23:24:00,1038, I used to fish it as a young boy and as a teenager but the 2  land owners have changed and denied land access to all but themselves.  So if I understand it properly they don't own the lake/pond. But do they own the swamp connected to it as well as 2 other lakes?
796832,Terry,2013-07-06 23:31:00,14456,there is a good chance the own much of the swamp or all of it navigable water is the key
796833,spincast,2013-07-06 23:33:00,3279,"I'd paddle.  But I agree with Chad: ""(if public or have permission), I'd be mentally prepared to turn around however."" especially if your that far North - lots of choices, who needs the Bull?"
