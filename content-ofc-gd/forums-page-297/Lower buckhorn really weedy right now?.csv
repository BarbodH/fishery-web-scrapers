795993,Joeytier,2013-07-02 03:59:00,3990,Its july in the kawarthas...itll be very weedy.  Lower buckhorn is not too bad from my (limited) experience though.
795998,fishindevil,2013-07-02 08:53:00,6254,Lots of weeds as per usual it's the kawarthas and the water temp is 74 so yes and there is already blue green algae growing but the fish don't mind the weeds just learn to fish them and you are good to go !!!!!

No hogs but still had a great time. All fish were caught on various texas rigged plastics. We were expecting overcast weather with chance of rain but it was mostly sunny and we got toasted lol.
