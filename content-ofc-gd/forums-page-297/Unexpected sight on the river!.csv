796171,Broker,2013-07-03 00:47:00,482,"Went for a little ride on the canoe in the Grand this afternoon tossin around some new lures to see how well they work.   Further on, I saw something off in the distance, puttered on over there and to my suprise, what it was... was the first Bald Eagle I've ever seen! boy these things are huge. Got some photos of him quickly not the best because i had to zoom in, but you get the idea. Made my week for sure, even caught a couple fish after he left  Here's the first Picture from when I was approaching...(did some editing to make it more clear)     This one just as Mr Eagle was ready to fly off, must've got to close for his liking   And lastly one of him skimming across the water before he left me in his dust...  hope you all enjoyed!

796176,manitoubass2,2013-07-03 01:01:00,11391,"Awesome pics and great first experience! Almost seems odd to me cause in nw ontario eagles are everywhere! Beautiful birds though, thats for sure!!!"
796177,spincast,2013-07-03 01:04:00,3279,Great pics.  There are a couple nesting pairs on the Grand. You can see one of the nests atop the poles on the northeast side of the bridge at Blair. Frequently these days they can also be seen over the Colborne St Bridge in Brantford. Awesome birds. Osprey can also be seen along the river this time of year. they seem to follow the river up and from there to??
796183,Jigger,2013-07-03 01:14:00,1237,That first pic of the eagle is awesome! Mustve been a really cool experience.
796187,Broker,2013-07-03 01:23:00,482,"Quite rare to see one out this way, and wasn't expecting to get that close to it either!"
796190,Live2fish85,2013-07-03 01:29:00,1633,Shasta there is actually a nest that is up near Mclung Rd. Just up from York. As well there are couple along Erie. I seen one this weekend as well flying around and that ate a bass I believe. Have also watched them feed out back of my parents a lot. My old man watched one attack a duck.
796194,Joeytier,2013-07-03 01:34:00,3990,Very nice photo.  Im lucky living in the north end of the ottawa river valley i can watch eagles off my back porch many days of the week.
796196,Broker,2013-07-03 01:41:00,482,This one would be the one off Mclung! Saw this guy right by there.
796234,Rich,2013-07-03 10:08:00,3927,There's quite a few along the grand from kitchener down.  Most aren't so photogenic. Nice pics.
796268,sauce,2013-07-03 15:32:00,219,that's actually an osprey nest on top of that pole. There is at least one pair of eagles that frequent the stretch of river between Cambridge and Kitchener. Ospreys are everywhere now.
796336,ehg,2013-07-03 21:36:00,2666,Great to see these big birds on the comeback.  Many thanks.
796341,chris.brock,2013-07-03 22:05:00,4053,"nice pictures, seems like they are doing well  for all the bird guys out there, I haven't seen a killdeer in years, where are they?"
796345,Broker,2013-07-03 22:39:00,482,"Not much of a bird guy, but those are everywhere in haldimand county! I can't even cut my grass or have a fire without a nest being in the way"
796358,Pikeslayer8,2013-07-03 23:58:00,336,Here's a few in Alaska!  
796364,Tim Mills,2013-07-04 00:51:00,476,Nice pics.  how do u lik e your canoe dolly?  Always looking for feedback on them

796413,TJQ,2013-07-04 13:13:00,7806,Great pics.  Tey are a large bird for sure!
796415,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-07-04 13:28:00,535,"I haven't seen one for years, either. We used to see them all the time as kids, running around with a wing dragging along the ground if you got too close to their nest."
796507,Joey,2013-07-04 22:56:00,9122,"Well that's nice to see, and cool that you got some pictures of it!!!"
796515,lew,2013-07-04 23:29:00,12766,Their definitely gorgeous birds and you got some great shots of them.  Here's a couple I see around my place quite frequentely.    
796551,lunkerbasshunter,2013-07-05 02:12:00,2585,what a great bird.  That is sooooo cool
796552,danc,2013-07-05 02:15:00,4677,I saw a seagull attacking one relentlessly the other day. Probably a motherhood thing.
