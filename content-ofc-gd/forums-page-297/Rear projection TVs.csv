795938,Big Cliff,2013-07-01 19:32:00,6899,I am looking for a bunch of rear projection TV screens any size any resolution.  If you have a rear projection TV that is no good or know of any I would really appreciate getting them (just the screen)  I am working on a project and if this works out I will have some very helpful information for any of you outdoor types.

795999,Big Cliff,2013-07-02 09:15:00,6899,Anything I want LOL This is a little more indepth than that though.   No kidding!!!!! If I can get this to work out the way I am thinking it will do a lot more than you can with your water proof matches.
