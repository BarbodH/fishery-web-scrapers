People who couldn't be intimidated by anyone but were the friendliest you could ever meet.  As for deadwood in companies ? Where I work, if they want to get rid of the slackers or deadwood, they can and have done so. They just have to keep meticulous records and keep the union abreast. Not much the union can do if there's a case to be made. Can't speak for other unions but I've heard enough about bad employees to make me shake my head.

795869,jammer,2013-07-01 11:21:00,43, Not all do but when they are constantly beaten down by concessions while profits sore...  I can see it...  Why can't employee's be treated like humans instead of numbers???  I understand a company needs to make profits to be successful but at what costs...  So many good jobs have gone south or east...  50 cent/hour wage gets you 50 cents worth of quality...  The middle class is rapidly disappearing...  I guess we can all get UNSKILLED jobs at Walmart and McDonalds though...  Who will be able to afford to go there though???  When the middle class is no longer...  When there is no financial influx of tax dollars...  When nobody can afford the products they produce...  Maybe then the big companies/government will get it but it will be too late...
795881,aplumma,2013-07-01 12:47:00,6896,"People seem to have this notion that they are not allowed to share in the profits of these companies. This is absolutely wrong you can at any time plunk down your cash that you have saved and buy a piece of the action. Sure saving money is hard self denial seems to be a thing of the past and people spend past their means so they can have it now and pay for it later. Think back to when you made 1/2 of what you do now and you survived just fine. Now take half of what you make and set it aside for as long as you can even if it is only for a month. The bank will pay you money for letting it just sit there. Now take 1/2 of it and move it to a savings account and don't touch it. You have a reserve or cushion to use if it is needed. See your head is above water now. It almost becomes a game to see how much you can set aside for something important. Now keep looking at that cash in the bank and start to look for a way to invest it so it works for you. Some will choose the stock market other will go for land etc. there are many ways to invest so the money is working for you. This is the point money can work just as hard as you do without draining your resources. One year of your wages working for you can equal a 10% gain in your net worth with no expenditures that means no car expenses no lunch expenses no time expended (except to track it but counting money is not really a burden).  The middle class is not disappearing because of the corporations it is disappearing because they don't know/ want to put out the efforts  for self help. All of this is available to anyone who wants it, it is free on the internet, there are older people who are dying to share their stories on how they became Middle class or better. Deny yourself a new car when you have to buy it on credit, if a credit card is not at zero every month then you are living above your means STOP IT stay home and cook dinner, go fishing locally, whatever it takes DO IT you will still be young enough after you get money to work for you to enjoy it. Every man can reach a goal if they want it bad enough I have reach quite a few of the things I decided I wanted when I was 21 years old. I am now 51 and I hope to fulfill another one of my wishes and that is to pass on the map to the path that I have taken that worked for me. I am a little long in the tooth here but it just aggravates me that people have forgotten that the rights of entitlement has gotten out of hand and people rarely take control of there future but rather blame it on everything else but what it is......THEMSELVES.....For the few people who do not have the ability to control there income due to illness or death (something else I forgotten) in the family keep the faith and use the services that the government has put into place to help you. For the rest of us take the time and the effort to improve your future it will only hurt a little but as you get older you will not feel like you can't afford a little treat for yourself now and then.

796036,jammer,2013-07-02 14:51:00,43,"   Workers at the Coca-Cola bottling facility in Brampton, Ontario were forced into a labour dispute early this morning after collective bargaining negotiations broke down between the company and the CAW. Pickets were set up near the facility (located at 15 Westcreek Blvd) at 12:01 a.m. CAW Local 973 Plant Chairperson Ryan Parson said the labour dispute is an unfortunate and frustrating turn of events, in what has been an unnecessarily difficult round of bargaining. ""Our members came to the bargaining table looking for modest improvements to our standard of living and work practices, and with every intention of signing a deal,"" Parson said. ""Coke management has clearly not come to the table with those same objectives. They've consistently stalled the process and have made it clear to us that it's their way or the highway."" Parson said the company refuses to back off a slate of concessionary demands that would create more instability and insecurity for Coke workers in Brampton. The company wants to remove all new hires from the existing pension plan; make it impossible for ""temporary"" employees to transfer to full-time; outsource skilled trades work; and weaken employee transfer rights in the event of layoff, among other demands. The work standards in Brampton, the company's largest facility in Canada, typically set the benchmark for Coke workers across the country. CAW Local 973 President Norm Chow said this dispute has nothing to do with money, since the two sides have not exchanged any monetary proposals (including over wages, benefits or pensions) over months of fruitless bargaining. ""Coke's global profits topped $9 billion in 2012. Their revenues are higher than the GDP of many nations. And they're fighting to undermine the working conditions of 700 workers. This is infuriating,"" Chow said. Parson said the company is taking a noticeably combative approach with the workers, which is fuelling frustration. ""As the strike deadline neared, Coke management forced our members to leave the plant, locking them out and is now refusing to pay them for the remainder of their shifts,"" Parson said. ""The company is also withholding the paycheques of temporary employees in the facility."""
796044,Headhunter,2013-07-02 15:27:00,5703,"I wonder how long this dispute will take to fizz out? Alternatively, why not stand outside the plant and toss Mentos at the plant! HH"
796085,aplumma,2013-07-02 19:36:00,6896,"Having to buy stock in a company that you helped make successful just to get a piece of the pie???  Seriously???  I actually am dead serious about investing to improve your future. The company you work for has already given you a piece of the pie it being an income and a job with some form of benefits. If you believe in the company then buy stock in it. If you believe in another company buy stock in it for your future. I owned some  bank stock when it was a good money maker and as it slid down I switched to the next money maker ""oil"". The point is the pressure on the company from the shareholders is greater than the unions so they will listen to the investors before the demands of the unions. It is economics 101 I personally do not like unions even though my trade (plumbing) has them they are a burden on the employees as well as the company. I don't have the expertise  to discuss unions so I won't comment further on them. I do know that wages invested make more money than wages spent. If you don't see any extra money in your budget then sit down with a budget manager at the bank they will see the holes and help you move to a better future.   Art"

796356,landry,2013-07-03 23:52:00,1005,"Pikehunter: U my friend are misinformed. U say u do not begrudge anyone their choices but u clearly have a grudge against teachers. I agree - retired teachers should let new teachers work and not supply teach part time. However, they are entitled to their pension as they paid heavy dues for years. Yes the govnt contributes but so do many large corporations with their employees. I never complain about my job. However I will state some facts for you so you are more accurately informed. I am not  whining as I have a good job: - I spent 15 0000 a year x 5 yrs plus I made no money while my buddy made 30 000 a year. That put me more than 300 000 behind him. Nobody would make an investment like that and not expect to make a good return on that investment. I am glad I did as I feel it was worth it. - I have taken many pay freezes and done my part to the tune of abou a 12% loss compared to the cost of living. I never get a raise, simply cost of living. Nobody would want their salary to move backwards. - a hard working teacher, works many extra hours. Just because the school day is only 6 hours does not mean I work 6 hours. Elementary teachers plan and invent most of their lessons. Textbooks r disappearing. - teaching, like all jobs, looks easy for the outside. In reality, the job is far more complicated. I am a a parent at times, counsellor, teacher, coach all at on e. I juggle the needs of 28 students who range in abilities for grade one to grade 9 in my grade six class. I teach autistic children, neglected children, brilliant learners who need enrichment, children with ill parents and many children with special needs. Each lesson is actually differentiated to meet all of these varying needs. It is more complicated than it seems from the outside. A good teacher makes it look easy. A bad teacher stands out cause they r quickly exposed - and not easily forgotten, (though protected by our union unfortunately). - I love my job. I will retire before it gets bad for education. And it will get bad. If u keep chipping away at teachers working conditions and cost of living corrections then we will eventually end up like many American states where it just doesn't make sense for skilled people to choose to teach. Is that what we really want for our children? Be careful what u wish for. Tell ya what- tell me what u do and I will gather inaccurate secondhand info and then post here why u r spoiled, overpaid and underworked. Or maybe we should all walk a mile in someone else's shoes befor we judge them eh? Just a thought for u before u criticize someone's profession in a public forum. Landry"
796370,landry,2013-07-04 01:20:00,1005,And by the way my point was that I started to question the coca cola strike and then I remembered how it felt when people judged me.
796694,SlowPoke,2013-07-05 21:18:00,2984,"Well said landry.   In my opinion, you have to ask yourself what is the task worth?  It's asking a lot to pay someone to organize a warehouse more than you would pay a soldier. It's hard to comprehend a cashier making more than a cop in some US cities. It's absurd to imagine a parking lot attendant making more than an EMT  On the flipside...  Is a CEO really worth $20-$30 mil + bonuses? Should an NHL player make more in 80 games than some people make in an entire lifetime? Should an on-air host reading from a teleprompter truly earn a better living than all the unpaid interns and paid staff combined that are providing the content?  The answer is always yes, provided you're the one on the high end of the equation. I live fairly comfortably but I could probably list 50 occupations that deserve to earn more than I do.We should keep this in mind when having a debate over wages.  Food for thought... the leading cause of a higher cost of living is cost of living increases."
795421,aplumma,2013-06-28 18:57:00,6896,"One of the missing things that add to the skirmish between Union and Corporate is ""corporate greed per say"" is fueled by it's responsibility to the stockholders.  The stockholders are just the average person who believes that the company will increase our holdings and produce a positive income. This fact is ignored usually when people want to paint the mother company as faceless or soulless . I know that as a shareholder in big corporate companies (non with Coke) I ask them to keep the profit as high as possible or I will lose faith in them and sell my miniscule holding. This in itself will not hurt the corporation if I lose faith, but if myself and XX% of the holders make the same decision then it could kill the corporation. I do know that one of my holdings is in the oil industry. I chose them because they are making some big money for the shareholders. This is the way I pay for my gas I use from day to day. My faith in the oil industry has paid for all of my gas I use in my cars, boats, and toys thru dividends and as a bonus paid for a 2012 Ford F150. There is a line of logical thinking that some people do not see and that is people who get ahead in life usually do it by sacrifice and risk both are needed to make it to your golden years and to keep them golden. Money that is earned has the potential to do one of two things. One is to be spent for gains some are pleasurable like a new boat and some is to pay for the basics in life. The second way money can be used is to turn it into a working, producing asset  for as long as you can and then pay for the basics before the pleasure items. This allows you to get ahead of the immediate in and out of money and money  can now make money for you.  I am just putting these things into the mix for all of us to think about till all of the facts are presented.   Art"

795601,bare foot wader,2013-06-29 20:30:00,1354,"hmmm, exec's make huge money because they have considerable education and experience and work crazy hours...yes there are dirty execs (Enron) just like there are dirty cops, but you can't paint them all with the same brush...  some guys expect to make 30/hr ++ with excellent benefits to do a job that requires minimal skill, when the same job can be paid in Mexico/overseas for 1/4 of the cost with thousands of resumes waiting on que trying to get in  North America is the second most expensive place to produce anything, European countries being first....I've worked in auto plants, construction through college and then in finance in the resort industry and now mining....I made more per hour doing labour/factory jobs then I did during my first 3 years post grad, 7 years later I've worked my butt off to make a great salary, I worked hard and didn't complain......but the guy that takes 10 smoke breaks a day for 20 mins each and cries about a bad back will get a raise this year even when the coal economy is very poor because he has a union that will threaten a strike  IMO there is an artificially high pay scale for unskilled jobs in Canada and until that scale levels out we will continue to see operations moved to cheaper economies overseas   why do people (like me) bash unions? because my old man worked in unions in the auto industry in southern ON his whole life, and now I'm a non unionized salary employee and work side by side with unionized guys....unions protect EVERYBODY, including the lazy parasites that abuse the employer and benefits programs, ""failure to represent"" needs to be removed from union contracts.....I've seen it my whole life, my dad's buddies who brag about making a career out of ""injuries"" and I see it everyday at work myself, the unions will go to bat for everybody, which hurts the honest guys in the long run....there was a point when unions protected violated and vulnerable employees but those days have changed and IMO they've outgrown their usefulness  striking over 26 bucks an hour when management was still willing to negotiate....pass the pepsi, no sympathy from me"
795612,landry,2013-06-29 21:44:00,1005,Barefoot. U r a very skilled communicator and u made many good points. I am in a union and I still agree with u.
795620,danc,2013-06-29 22:35:00,4677,"For the past 25 years or so, my union job has given me a raise to keep up to inflation, which I think is fair. Nothing more. Nothing less. Yes, we start out asking for the moon, and they start out offering a $10.00 an hour pay cut. But reasonable minds always  prevail and life goes on."

795218,lickmyarmpit,2013-06-27 22:04:00,359,Everybody coca cola brampton is on strike boycott all coca cola products. http://www.coca-colacompany.com/brands/all#TCCC http://www.coca-colacompany.com/brands/all#TCCC  How can a company that profits in the billions (yes with a B  ) be so arrogant as to expect us to take concessions on our pensions and benefits.  This kind of greed is good for no one and makes me sick to even be affiliated with a corporation that has no respect for the employees that help make them this obscene amount of money............thank you everyone for your support.
795219,danc,2013-06-27 22:10:00,4677,"Well I'll definately support this. I haven't drank a Coke in probably 40 years, so count me in."
795220,SlowPoke,2013-06-27 22:10:00,2984,What affiliation do you have with Coca Cola?
795221,misfish,2013-06-27 22:14:00,29133,"No their not,,,,,,,,,"

795226,davey buoy,2013-06-27 22:31:00,5505,20 years coke free for me.  .I'll defineatly support this!
795227,lickmyarmpit,2013-06-27 22:32:00,359,Thanks for the support guys
795228,ketchenany,2013-06-27 22:33:00,3229,I'm with Dan. I've never tasted a Pepsi or Seven Up.
795231,Roy,2013-06-27 22:34:00,13728,"The problem is that a strike will probably not hurt Coca-Cola in the least. They're already in 10 Provinces with 6,300 employees. Hell, we have 2500 more members than that  <---- That was supposed to be a funny. My feeling is that the membership should have negotiated...but hey, that's just my opinion."
795241,ketchenany,2013-06-27 22:51:00,3229,"Roy, can we negotiate a pension/benefit plan? The OFC POST mortum plan!"
795243,Roy,2013-06-27 22:53:00,13728," Sure Bud.....what would you like? So far, if a post is deemed mort, it stays that way."
795246,fishing n autograph,2013-06-27 22:57:00,2540,You got my support. I don't drink pop
795253,HTHM,2013-06-27 23:13:00,4082,Everyone knows that cops don't drink SOFT drinks... Just kidding.
795262,crappieperchhunter,2013-06-27 23:43:00,2582,"Is it corporate greed....  expanding legacy costs.... or a combination of both? I couldn't support either side unless I knew all the facts.  Legacy costs will be the ruin of many pension plans in the next 20 years. We lost our pension last March...but us ""old timers"" have our time accumulated pensions grandfathered."
795289,aplumma,2013-06-28 01:28:00,6896,To support a union or a corporation without knowing what is on the table and why it is needed is to blindly chose a side without logical reasons.  Without both sides presenting facts it falls into an us against them mentality that will either cause the union to make unfair demands or the corporation to pull out of a viable area. Both sides need to bend to find the common ground or both sides will lose with the corporation taking the least amount of damage. The economy is changing and we as the consumers are demanding more product for less money and that is  putting a lot of pressure on the corporations. We as a race have embarked down a path that is a dead end you can not have your bread buttered on both sides anymore. You either pay the price that keeps rising because of the overhead and get paid more ( our plight of the last 50 years) or you cut the prices and trim the budget to match. There will not be an easy answer while we as a society make this change but it is a change that is needed or a loaf of bread will be $10.00 and that is a scary future to think about as you prepare for our golden years of retirement.

795298,grimsbylander,2013-06-28 02:15:00,3016,Art has very eloquently summed it up. Well written.  I deleted my version as to not initiate a locked thread.
795305,lickmyarmpit,2013-06-28 02:38:00,359,"Well said plummer, a locked thread isn't what I was going for. Just wanted to make a voice heard and with the age of technology we live in this is one of the many outlets to use.   Things aren't going to change unless we all stand up for what we believe in.  Its only a matter of time  before the big guy gets so big you can't stand up to them anymore.  What we negotiate in brampton has the ripple down effect to all that happens with further negotiations with this company in this country. Brampton is the biggest plant in canada and a flag ship plant for the company. The gta is one of the most populus areas in north america with a world wide voice. If not now, when can people say enough is enough!  Corporate greed is killing the way of life for too many, when will the middle class cease to exist?  Thanks again for all support"
795311,SlowPoke,2013-06-28 03:03:00,2984,"I know a lifer there, a former union rep that stepped down over the politics inside. You probably know who I'm referring to and his reasoning. Companies enter negotiations with long term forecasts and profitability in mind, not past results. Unions enter negotiations with the intent to better current and future remuneration. Sometimes these expectations can not be met, it happened to me. My previous employer was asleep at the switch and the cuts came too late, as deep as they were. I sustained a 20% cut over three years. I too was ashamed to work for such a company so I left after 18 years service and senior man in the region. I rode the gravy train about three years too long."
795321,adempsey,2013-06-28 04:11:00,1498,Welcome to the new world of business.  It's either reach an agreement soon or not have a job.   I am sure they would shut it down without hesitation.
795329,Cudz,2013-06-28 05:22:00,2652,I saw the guys on strike on Bayview today in front of the coke depot
795338,jammer,2013-06-28 11:15:00,43,When profits soar the last thing on the table should be concessions...  Its a race to the bottom...  Soon there will be no middle class or decent paying jobs...  One thing the rich haven't realized is who is going to buy there products when we all work at Walmart...  Good luck with your negotiations...
795352,outllaw,2013-06-28 13:23:00,1232,aplumma yer right. I am in my golden years. hopefully both sides come to terms. as for corporate greed we all know that story
795390,PitViper,2013-06-28 15:50:00,33,Wouldn't have this problem at pepsi  just kidding its miller time. I support this
795395,BillM,2013-06-28 16:09:00,17367,Has anyone outlined the 'sticking' points in the contract?   Hard to form an opinion when there are zero facts/hard numbers to go on..
795410,esoxansteel,2013-06-28 17:03:00,1307,"  I am assuming that you work for Coke, for how long?, i assume you also make a decent wage, with excellent benefits, if you dont like your job, and are digraced to work for a successful company that makes a profit which assures you job security, quit quit quit, then work 2 to 3 jobs at minimum wage, to make ends meet, or you can go on welfare like millions of Canadian White Trash do and expect the Canadian taxpayer to provide them with accomadation, food, spending money, health care, dental, and legal aid, i would think you have it pretty good at Coke. Thanx for letting me blow off some steam before the long weekend, Happy Canada Day to all hard working Canadians, im off to Loblaws to by a case of Coke for my Canadian Whisky."
