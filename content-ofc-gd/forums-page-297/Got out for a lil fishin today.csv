At my usual spot, I landed a few more 1-1.5lbers using spinnerbaits and the some whatsit jigs... then I tried something I've never done before, cut a big dead shiner in half and caught a 3lber using the head .. and a 4lber using the other half... within minutes of each other.  Here's the only picture I got. It's of the 4lber, weighed and released. "

So choppity chop, hookity hook and cast'r on oot. No catties, but definitely to my surprise were the two nice sized bass."
