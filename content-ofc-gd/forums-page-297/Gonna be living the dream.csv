795091,woodenboater,2013-06-27 12:08:00,2277,congratulations ! 160 acres will be a nice wood lot and being in an unorganized township will make life easy for building. I can see trail cutting in your future lol. are you also thinking of a large garden as well as chickens and rabbits ?
795093,Rod Caster,2013-06-27 12:18:00,5784,"Yes. My wife and I really want to be mostly self sustaining for food... so that means lots of fruits/veg, herbs and as much wild food as possible. These will be longer term plans as we need to accustom ourselves to basics of bush living first. You are right about the trail cutting, there are only two small trails on the entire property. There isn't even a trail to the river yet!"
795099,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-27 13:22:00,2690,Enjoy Chad!!  Sounds fantastic...a river full of specks...YEAH BABY!!
795100,TJQ,2013-06-27 13:23:00,7806,Good for you.. and yes.. you'll never be bored.
795103,motv8tr,2013-06-27 13:33:00,2587,Congratulations!!!! That sounds like a little piece of heaven to me....now all you need is a dog or two for company and you're all set
795114,Roy,2013-06-27 14:33:00,13728,"Chad, congrats to you! Now you'll have no trouble choosing Christmas and BD gifts for the wife. With her new calling in life, the wife will need a tractor and a chainsaw."
795126,cityfisher,2013-06-27 14:55:00,959,"Congrats! I have thought about moving from GTA to a place like that but my wife would probably say "" You crazy! If your going, your doing it alone!"""
795131,woodenboater,2013-06-27 15:34:00,2277," good god man, GET TO WORK !!!!!     everything else  can wait"
795133,NAW,2013-06-27 15:51:00,4022,That is amazing news!!! So happy for you man!!Now you will have room to house plenty on OFC'r for guided spec fishing trips!!!
795145,Christopheraaron,2013-06-27 16:31:00,3525,I'll be the first to sign up!
795182,CRUD150,2013-06-27 19:59:00,87,Talk about living the dream......
795273,Moosebunk,2013-06-28 00:22:00,3970,Does sound like a little piece of heaven.  Congrats on the purchase.
795320,Joeytier,2013-06-28 04:07:00,3990,"Ive already started accepting payments from hunters...hope you're OK with this.  Start cutting trails, please."
795810,Rod Caster,2013-06-30 23:52:00,5784,"haha, she's suprisingly ok with that.   That would be a big move from the GTA... being from North Bay, I'm already 25% bushman so it'll be an easy transition   Special rates for the Nipissing G2G members!   Trade some birds/deer for free labour?"
795857,adolson,2013-07-01 06:06:00,783,"I was just wondering if you had got the place mentioned not long ago, and now I saw this post.. I'm a bit behind the times, I apologize... Congrats to you two! The speck water sounds like the best part, no matter what you paid for the property."
795878,Rod Caster,2013-07-01 12:35:00,5784,Thanks Dana. The river is a great feature...although its far back in the property. We are going to access the river today through crown land and see what I just bought!
796014,manitoubass2,2013-07-02 12:35:00,11391,"Stoked for ya chad!!!!  Im currently searching myself to build next year, on a lake with trophy lakers, musky, pike, walleye and tons of panfish! Getting all our maps this week and scouting next week. Even the thought of scouting land has me more than amped!!!"
796023,Rod Caster,2013-07-02 13:15:00,5784,"That's awesome!! Your lucky up there that lake front property isn't basically a financial suicide! Even in and around North Bay if you want property on a decent lake (not a swamp), the prices and taxes are way inflated. Hope your dock will be located right near a shoal/dropoff! haha"
796030,manitoubass2,2013-07-02 14:08:00,11391,
794929,Rod Caster,2013-06-26 18:57:00,5784,"Finally made the move to a slightly bigger house/property. From a 1bdrm condo overlooking North Bay to a 160acres bush lot in unorganized township with a very energy efficient house, with 400 meter frontage on a river chock full of speckled trout!  Very happy right now and a little nervous. Boredom will no longer be an issue for me.  Now I need a chainsaw, ladder, tools, riding lawn mower, snow blower etc etc etc etc etc etc  woo hoo!"
794932,solopaddler,2013-06-26 19:19:00,8605,Way to go jogging pants dude!! That sounds just about perfect to me. Good luck with everything!
794934,fishnsled,2013-06-26 19:30:00,3520,That is awesome!!  Congrats!!
794938,Christopheraaron,2013-06-26 19:42:00,3525,Awesome! This would be the river you were telling me about before?
794939,Joey,2013-06-26 19:44:00,9122,"Sounds like a dream, WAKE UP!!!!   Congrats!"
794941,davey buoy,2013-06-26 20:08:00,5505,"Always wanted to buy backed on a river.Congrats,I'm sure you'll love it.!!  .Maybe some day?."
794948,Rod Caster,2013-06-26 20:23:00,5784,"Not the river your thinking of Chris, it's about half that size and a little more remote.  Pretty darn excited and i don't think it's a dream...I'm actually wearing jogging pants"
794949,limeyangler,2013-06-26 20:30:00,5204,Congrats Chad...that sounds awesome....ENJOY....like you need to be told that....lol.
794950,Christopheraaron,2013-06-26 20:32:00,3525,"Nice, should be a blast!"
794954,Rod Caster,2013-06-26 21:10:00,5784,"absolutely! Can't wait to see how good/bad the fishing really is! First things first though...need to cute TONS of wood!  Anyone looking for private access to hunting land with crown land abutting, give me msg, we can maybe make arrangments. Trail cams say there are LOTS of deer, bear and moose."
794956,cheaptackle,2013-06-26 21:32:00,849,Sounds Great Chad!  But I've seen you cast and would worry about how you'd wield a chainsaw or other power tools - so I guess you'll just have to invite me up with all mine to prevent you from injuring yourself!  Michael
794958,Rod Caster,2013-06-26 21:40:00,5784,hahaha...imagine me with a 70cc professional chainsaw... I hope shark-bite-proof chain pants are on sale!  If you ever pass through North Bay...give me a holler!
794987,bigugli,2013-06-26 23:37:00,6138,Sounds great.  It is a major change in lifestyle that you should quickly get used to.  Just be sure to bearproof all the buildings and sheds.
794989,wormdunker,2013-06-26 23:50:00,1711,"Hey Chad, I have all of the above mentioned tools.  Can I be your best friend?  You work with the tools, I'll scout out the river for you!!  Good luck at the new property.  A word of advice.  Chainsaws are a very dangerous tool.  Treat them with utmost respect.  I cut many a bush lot in my younger days.  I suggest you purchase the appropriate safety gear such as loggers boots. loggers chaps, hard hat with ear muffs & face shield, loggers gloves.  The rubber boots with the spikes are excellent in winter to grip ice, snow & logs.  Be careful you don't twist an ankle.  When they dig in they don't move sideways.  Good luck"
794992,Twocoda,2013-06-26 23:53:00,4130,Congrates...i so want to do this too... but having a hard time convincing the other half....ive been crusing the mls for a week now....
794997,spinnerbaitking,2013-06-27 00:14:00,1622,"Sounds like the makings of a OFC get together lol, Congrats you will enjoy Tight Lines SBK"
795003,kickingfrog,2013-06-27 00:43:00,8333,One day I hope I can do the same.
795010,spincast,2013-06-27 00:55:00,3279,"right on Chad - awesome news! how about some pics of the new homestead, just so I am completely envious LOL. And, if the winters stay like they have I may have snow blower for ya - real cheap. 2 years, 1 short appearance."
795030,Acountdeleted,2013-06-27 01:33:00,2562,Congrats bud. May it bring you many years of happiness.
795036,Nipfisher,2013-06-27 01:59:00,2449," I am looking for land to hunt and rivers to fish. I have a chainsaw, ladder, and lots of energy. Lets go check out the land when you take possession. I was thinking about texting you for an update today."
795043,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-27 02:34:00,2050,Awesome - we want to see some pics man!  Good luck sounds sweeeet!
795085,gino,2013-06-27 11:20:00,400,"Chad, that's an awesome news...enjoy your new home!"
795086,Cosmos,2013-06-27 11:38:00,588,Congrats Chad. It's always nice to have a lot of free space.
795088,Rod Caster,2013-06-27 12:00:00,5784,"I'll have to get some bearspray for the wife AND show her how to use it. Eventually we'll get a dog as we plan on having chickens/rabbits. I figure that'll be a good bear deterent as well. Thanks!  Great advice. I'll be looking to my father for advice for chainsaws and chainsaw safety... I have a bit of experience, but definitly need to make sure I start this properly and safely.   I told myself that if this deal didn't go through, I'd be putting a 6month block on the MLS webpage haha. I got lucky and pulled off a private deal on this one! Saved $20,000 over the MLS listed price (I viewed the place a couple days before they listed).  Sounds like fun...and free labour hahaha.  I live in a condo, so I basically own a toaster, hockey equipment, spare truck tires and some fishing gear.... I NEED stuff like that. Let me know if your serious about the blower, I'm interested.  Fantastic! I'd love to show you around, take you birding/fishing and maybe do some work with you!"
795089,Rod Caster,2013-06-27 12:01:00,5784,I'll post some July 20th...hopefully my bush high-speed internet can handle OFC!!!!
