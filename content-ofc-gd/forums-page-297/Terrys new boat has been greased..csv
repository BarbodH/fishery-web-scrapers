Terry never gets the first fish when it comes to down rigg,n lakers. That changed today. The morning did start out very slow. Lots of hooks,but no takers. Then it happen.  Terry nails a nice Simcoe laker. And it wasnt on our usual go too,s.       I was running my go to baits,and it took sometime til I finaly got one.     Lots of boats out there this morning. We stayed away from the pack and tried new waters.  Thanks again bud.  Do it again soon. "
