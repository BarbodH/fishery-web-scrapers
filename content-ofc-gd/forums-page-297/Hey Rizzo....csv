796380,Sinker,2013-07-04 02:10:00,8692,Silly bass......
796384,Rizzo,2013-07-04 02:42:00,4754,hahah I see your luck is as good as mine! Maybe you need a bigger bait. Glad to see you are getting out at least
796386,Rizzo,2013-07-04 02:59:00,4754,"...oh and remember, one of those waypoints is actually a rock, not a musky location. I'm too electronically challenged to label them. Hope you don't find that one (its on Head Lake in case you forgot)"
796425,NAW,2013-07-04 14:12:00,4022,"Totally off topic.  I saw this post, and thought of my ""new to me"" musky rod.....  Paid $10 for it!!  With the reel...  This MUST be the same Rizzo!!  Right?    "
796537,Rizzo,2013-07-05 00:50:00,4754,wow $10? I'll give you 15 (it has my name on it after all). Actually the Rizzo is after Frank Rizzo...R I Z Z O of jerky boys fame
