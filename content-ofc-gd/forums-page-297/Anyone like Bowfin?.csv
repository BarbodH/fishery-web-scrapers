796005,MCTFisher9120,2013-07-02 11:45:00,3761,"Fight harder than any other fish. Here is one from last summer pushing 7lbs on the slop frog   A summer before then another giant   Many small ones too, they are in the shallow water but with thick cover above. They are settled best in the warm water, turns out I frog lot's and find them in the same places bass live.  Here is a 10lb 1oz monster bass opening week in the evening on a popper & 10lb Braid, unreal battle.     Hate em but there fun to catch"

796191,fishsevern,2013-07-03 01:31:00,112,"I was hoping to see a 10 lber.  Huge bowfin, you deserve a pat on the back. Most i've caught dropping whatever into a small hole through the thick green slop. If anyone really wants to try......fish the shallow slop in the summer and I found them the same area as crappie in the spring.  Thats GBay though"
