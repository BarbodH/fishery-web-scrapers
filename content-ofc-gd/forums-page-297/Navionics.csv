786862,Angler management,2013-05-16 00:51:00,280,"Hey guys, just bought a Navionics Hotmaps platinum. I was very surprised to find that all of Algonquin park was blanked out... I find it pretty odd that one of the most popular tourist hot-spots in canada isnt shown on the most expensive chart. Is there any charts out there that will show me the area?"
786891,BillM,2013-05-16 02:04:00,17367,I doubt you'll find any map chips with Algonquin park hydrocharts on it.  Not really surprised to be honest.
786902,Angler management,2013-05-16 02:11:00,280,"How come i have all the surrounding areas covered, and Algonquin is exclusively not covered? Does anybody have a reason why it isnt covered? Perhaps government doesnt allow it?"
786912,BillM,2013-05-16 02:24:00,17367,How many of those lakes actually allow motorized boat travel?  I know there are some exceptions but most don't..
786915,Angler management,2013-05-16 02:30:00,280,"A lot of the lakes dont allow motors, but lakes such as Opeongo should be covered. Even if they dont allow motors, there are still hazards that can be avoided by being able to look at charts and dangers."
787072,RJackson,2013-05-16 20:19:00,113,Lots of lakes aren't on the chip.  Simply reliable data doesn't exist.  Download Canada Maps on your Iphone.  Awesome App.  Though it wont show you depths of lakes it does give you exact lay of the land.  Just make sure you are on a wifi when you start to download the maps.  RJ
791116,RichNavionics,2013-06-07 18:16:00,22,There are a few reasons why it might not be included. 1. the data isn't available for purchase or doesn't exist 2. the data is too expensive to purchase for such a small lake  The Navionics mobile app is $15 and shows charts of all of N. America that are on the chips sold for GPS chart plotters. here is the link to see what lakes are on either the app of the chips themselves: http://navionics.com/en/hotmaps-platinum click on any region to populate the list.
791119,Roy,2013-06-07 18:21:00,13728, Thank you Rich. Good info coming from a Navionics dude.
791153,porkpie,2013-06-07 20:50:00,2521,"I second Canada maps for info.  I have both it and navionics on my phone, as well as a navionics card for my plotter/sounder.  The Canada maps won't give you detail anything like navionics, but is certainly handy to have for the lay of the land!"
791258,Parnelly,2013-06-08 15:31:00,108,"I have the Navi mobile app on my phone. Even after trying to download the area, Opeongo still isnt listed. Along with the surrounding waters. Ive also noticed one lake in particular that is connected to another lake, the map stops right in between the two."
791260,BillM,2013-06-08 15:35:00,17367,Opeongo will probably never be listed.
793754,RichNavionics,2013-06-21 01:27:00,22,"Hopefully we will have a cure for missing lakes by next spring. We just introduced Sonarcharts in the states.(http://www.navionics.com/en/sonarcharts) If the process takes off, then you will see tons of new data early next year. With certain Humminbird and Garmin plotters, you can start recording your sonar logs now, upload the data to Navionics, and you will get back new and improved charts. Even for lakes that aren't covered, you can create the maps. The link shows you how with some cool videos."
793755,RichNavionics,2013-06-21 01:29:00,22,"If you update the app, you will see that an in-app purchase is available for auto-routing. Based on your boat settings and the chart data, Auto-routing will plot a course for your travels! Routes can be edited for alternate plans or situations. Auto-routing is for general planning and reference only â€“ it does NOT replace safe navigation practices and should never be your only reference source."
795921,RichNavionics,2013-07-01 17:17:00,22,SonarCharts was released in the US and hopefully won't be too long before it is released up north. here are two screen shots of what I recorded two weeks ago. Big difference in the data from before Hurricane Sandy and after.
