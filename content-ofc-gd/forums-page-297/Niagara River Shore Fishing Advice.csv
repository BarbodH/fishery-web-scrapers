796099,Tim Mills,2013-07-02 21:07:00,476,I'm going to pick up a scanoe in Rochester tomorrow and thought I would stop in and shore fish at the Glen on the way.  I enjoy fishing there but have had minimal success. Last time I fished it there was an algae bloom.  Does anyone have any suggestions or techniques that work well this time of year?
