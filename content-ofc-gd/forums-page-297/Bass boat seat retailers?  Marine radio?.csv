796220,mcdougy,2013-07-03 03:53:00,274,look at lebaron. fairly close to you also.
796222,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-03 03:54:00,10439,Try Cabelas and West Marine also.
796225,mistaredone,2013-07-03 04:15:00,913,Never seen bass boat seats at LBs but good excuse for a visit.  Cabelas seems to have the same products as BPS?  I'll look up West marine.  Thanks
796226,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-03 04:17:00,10439,Check Radio World and West Marine for a marine radio. I got my ICOM from West Marine.
796227,mcdougy,2013-07-03 04:23:00,274,The lebaron catalog i grabbed last visit definetly has a bunch of seats in it. I don't recall seeing them in the store either . They may just bring them in when ordered.  I guess check the website beforehand and give them a call for the skinny on seats.      there is also SAIL.

796312,aplumma,2013-07-03 19:48:00,6896,I redid my 1985 Ranger with the seats from bassboat.com they are correctly padded and well made. The foam is dense enough to cut down the spine jarring that the stock seats didn't. This is the third season and they appear new  but I do take care of my toys and it lives in a garage.   Art

In fact, they're downright treacherous as the  hinges fold down like a guillotine. Especially hazardous to children. Check the hinges out prior to purchase."
796403,Tim Mills,2013-07-04 11:16:00,476,I've been looking for economical seats for a crawdad jon boat. Sail has a good selection of basic  seats in store but I don't think they are on the website.  I was at gander Mountain yesterday and the prices for the seats I was looking at were the same as sail.  Lebanon's seats are on the wall up high easy to miss if your not looking for them.  BP has a better selection than sail or LB and they have some good deals especially if your not picky about color. For instance they had a skid of seats for 65$ but only in grey.
796422,aplumma,2013-07-04 14:05:00,6896,Good point Roy the drivers seat and main passenger seats in a high performance boat should not be the folding type. The pass thru seat to get to the back of the bass boats can be a folder to make it easier to get to the back of the boat.   Art
