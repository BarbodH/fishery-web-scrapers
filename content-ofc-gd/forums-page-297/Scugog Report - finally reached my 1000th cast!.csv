Soobnoob was targeting Wally's so we both were on a mission. I started with some spinner baits, followed by some swim baits and nothing. Switch to a XRap when suddenly my buddy yells ""fish on!""Image downsized - click on the image to get an original view39 inches 9.5 lbs. After a quick picture back it went. I was excited to know that those toothly critters were there and my chance WILL come.20 minutes later I get a hit. Could this be the elusive fish?Image downsized - click on the image to get an original viewNope just a Largie.. Back it went. soobnoob switches to topwater to have some fun and after his 5th cast I hear a big splash.Image downsized - click on the image to get an original viewAfter this one I beginning to thing what the hell, i'm never going to catch my first.a few more bass later it was time for us to go. ( wife only gave me permission for a half day adventure)Image downsized - click on the image to get an original viewSo tried to start the motor and it was acting up. soobnoob said ""let's use the trolling motor and go back slowly. Hopefully the outboard will come to its senses"" I figured why not troll for a little bit and see what happens. About 1 1/2 km from the docks I get a hit and this ....Image downsized - click on the image to get an original viewThey say musky's are a fish of 1000 casts. I guess I reached my 1000th! What a fish! worth the wait. Quick pic and back in the water quickly.We talked about how we caught everything Except a Wally to complete our day and guess what happened on my 1001 cast.....Image downsized - click on the image to get an original viewWhat a memorable day!! couldn't have a better outing.

796067,Jds63,2013-07-02 17:26:00,1365,very nice to see your efforts paid off !!!
796073,lew,2013-07-02 17:51:00,12766,"Well done, the 1st one is always the hardest to catch."
796074,quickme,2013-07-02 17:54:00,261, Its been a while buddy!!!   We should hook up sometime!  Fishing is much easier on the bones than 9 man!  shoulders still take a pounding chucking those musky lures!
796075,quickme,2013-07-02 17:55:00,261,thanks for the comments guys.  Can't wait to get back out there.  Damn family and responsibilities!
796089,Joey,2013-07-02 19:49:00,9122,"I thought it was 10,000 casts, not 1,000.  Either way, well done, she's a beauty!!!"
796090,quickme,2013-07-02 19:55:00,261,  Than I'm ahead of the game!!!     I'm pretty sure I'm past 10000 cast in my lifetime.  Maybe it's 1000 cast per outing?
796284,EC1,2013-07-03 16:35:00,930,"WTG with the muskie. Can't believe you got a nice walleye from the dock! Last time I was putting my canoe away there, I heard a few giant fish splashing around in the vicinity - But I would never think you'd get one during the day time."
796344,Rizzo,2013-07-03 22:32:00,4754,fantastic day! Congrats on your first she's a beauty looking fish. The next one won't take as long

796367,ketchenany,2013-07-04 00:58:00,3229,"Thanks Lew, I've seen three in 40 years and nothing over 37 inches, all went back!"
796398,lew,2013-07-04 09:50:00,12766, Perhaps it's time to try a different bait
