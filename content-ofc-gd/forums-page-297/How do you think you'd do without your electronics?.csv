795703,Sinker,2013-06-30 15:18:00,8692,"I would get by fine, but it would suck!!  S."
795705,BillM,2013-06-30 15:19:00,17367,"Fishing the same spots I do all the time?  No big deal..  New water or the Lake O for salmon?  Yeah good luck, lol."
795716,Sinker,2013-06-30 16:08:00,8692,I'd be fine on big water with no structure. Fishing structure would suck tho!!
795717,davey buoy,2013-06-30 16:17:00,5505,"I think I would be fine,let the hook drop to the bottom than give it a crank or two up."
795733,BillM,2013-06-30 18:51:00,17367, Those lures would get a great washing
795840,northernpike56,2013-07-01 02:57:00,717,"I think I would do pretty good (well, normal for me) without electronics b/c I never use them (even though I do own a fishfinder). Usually to do well for species like walleye or something I stick to very obvious places where I think they might be at very obvious times. (ex. 10-20 feet out from points at dusk)"
795843,northernpike56,2013-07-01 03:04:00,717,"also, some places when I am at a cottage, if I see a spot that might be decent (usually a rock face or something) I will go diving to check it out a few hours before I fish it. I have even seen a few smallmouth cruising around these said ledges, and they don't even seem to care that you're there with them. pretty cool to watch, and gives you a very good idea of what the depth and structure is like underwater"
795855,limeyangler,2013-07-01 05:45:00,5204,"I would suffer, stare at my screen a lot."
795903,d_paluch,2013-07-01 14:34:00,343,I wouldn't suffer because I really don't know what its like to fish WITH electronics  I need a real boat
795909,FloatnFly,2013-07-01 15:28:00,1640,"you know, i have much better luck fishing without them, been out on a friends boat, have only landed 1 fish on itand he relies on his fish finder, my dad an g/fs dad haveno electronics on their boats, and i have caught countless fish on them,  so i think i do just fine without them"
795910,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-07-01 16:02:00,0,I generally do ok without them but much of this is often because i've fished an area before WITH electronics.  when fishing new water i like to have electronics to at least get a rough lake profile in my head.
795913,backbay,2013-07-01 16:26:00,773,"I know the area I fish pretty well, but I like electronics for finding shcools of bait fish while trolling"
795917,SlowPoke,2013-07-01 16:58:00,2984,"My electronics saved me $300 on Saturday.  We were fishing 4' rollers and landing a fish. I still had a rod out on the planer board tipped down 45* and the boat was rockin' hard. I figure at some point with the heavy waves, the rod holder (Bert's Ratcheting Tube) was parallel with the water  and the pull from the planer board sucked it right out of the boat.  We released the fish and Rob said ""Ummm, where's your rod?""  We pulled the big planer board in hoping the release was still clinching the line but no luck.  We cleared the rods, spun the boat around and re-deployed in hopes to snag the line. Thankfully I was running a Harvo at the time and it's a floating lure. I followed our track on the GPS which was extremely challenging in high winds and waves and prevailed. Saved a Tekota 600LC, rod and muskie lure.  For trolling I utilize electronics heavily on big water for navigation, systematic trolling, speed and water temperature. Secondary benefits are structure and fish activity. Many of my fish over the years are produced from a clean sonar screen; flat bottom and little activity. If I had to choose either sonar OR gps for trolling, I'd take gps.  For casting and small water, the electronics are nice to get you to a spot but then your senses and instinct have to take over. A paper chart or topo map is just as useful for finding humps and saddles. Your lure will tell you all you need to know about structure. Practice and education will tell you where the fish should be and your senses will confirm if you are correct. That's where the best anglers excel. ChrisK and I were fishing walleye on the same spot, same presentation and he's outfishing me 5-1. He's in the back of the boat telling me ""hey, you got one on"" LOL!! The same goes for icefisherman (Emil), fishing the same baits a few feet apart on the ice and getting outfished 5-1. I don't think I even want to attempt carp and walleye fishing with Bly.... LOL!!"
796561,lunkerbasshunter,2013-07-05 02:47:00,2585,I fish without them and do fine. If I am in deep water it sure would help though.
796588,FloatnFly,2013-07-05 12:13:00,1640,"  think there was a bit of luck involved with that, the wind didn't blow the lure off trackor the rod didn't drag it down"
795454,mike rousseau,2013-06-28 21:57:00,4661,So I was wondering.... How many anglers feel they can still be successful without any electronics..... I was thinking about doing a little derby with some friends and family with no electronics just to see...  I think it would be very interesting and challenging...  I'm assuming my catch would be negatively effected... But I'm still pretty sure I could put enough fish in the boat....  So... Could you still do well for the species you target without electronics...?
795482,aplumma,2013-06-28 23:41:00,6896,I would say to level the playing field you have to go to a body of water that no one has fished before. I am sure I would suffer for the most part trying to scout new water without electronics. I can say that I rarely use electronic in areas that I have learned very well like pond X a 40 acre impound that I have learned the ins and outs of. I use my electronics heavily in unknown water especially when navigating up North with the shoals and ledges that spring up.   Art
795490,landry,2013-06-29 00:15:00,1005,Just fine likely.
795493,hirk,2013-06-29 00:25:00,571,depends how and where you fish but myself i have a 520c at the wheel i almost never turn on and a bow unit i use but could do without and would not really hurt any.
795495,misfish,2013-06-29 00:31:00,29133,"Amagine what they did with just depth charts? PAPER   To me it all depends what your fishing for. Bass,well,weeds,pads shallows.Nuff said.LOL  Good question."
795499,ketchenany,2013-06-29 00:58:00,3229,River fishing! Specs under cover. No electronics here!
795502,dhickey,2013-06-29 01:19:00,1038,Well to be honest I don't like electronics and I think that people that rely on them are missing out on one of the most challenging things they can do in their spare time. I will be going to a small lake that I have fished for over 40 years this weekend and the one thing I know for shure is I will have to work to find them and work to keep them biting. It doesn't always work on the July long weekend but that's the challenge and it doesn't stop me from buying more lures/ bait or spending money just to test my self.  Keep in mind this is coming from a guy that refuses to use electronics ice fishing Simcoe.  So if you know the fish your looking for you should be able to figure out weather patterns water temps/conditions along with their natural tendencies and zero in on them. It may take some time and work but its worth it.
795504,colin519,2013-06-29 01:30:00,101,"It all comes down to how familiar you are with the body of water you are fishing, how much time you have to familiarize yourself with it, and you ability to adjust your tackle to the situation.  The electronics I think just help you find structure and stay on it, as well as help identify trends in catching depth etc. Also, trends in not catching of course.  Of course, gimme some white, yellow and black/purple twister tails and jig heads and you can catch something pretty much anywhere in Ontario."
795510,asdve23rveavwa,2013-06-29 02:49:00,2690,"Ice Fishing love them, and, would be tough to fish without. However on most of the lakes I fish I hardly use mine."
795511,danc,2013-06-29 02:54:00,4677,Pretty much same here. But I do use my unit for water temps which has paid off for me in the past.
795513,jedimaster,2013-06-29 03:07:00,3472,"Largies... no problem... pike, musky, spring time walleye, early morning small mouth, inland lake trout, river fishing, crappie in the spring also no problems. ice fishing in over 20fow smallies during the day, walleye in the summer electronics definitely help. If they don't you are doing it wrong. I have a dsi and its nice but I can do without it."
795514,Broker,2013-06-29 03:11:00,482,"Don't have any, yes they'd be great for ice fishing but what I have found with a few friends is they spend too much time fiddling with electronics with less time with their rod in the water!"
795517,OhioFisherman,2013-06-29 04:46:00,6623,"In Ohio maps are available for all the lakes i have fished, so it is a lot easier to have a general idea of a good place to start? The safety factor also, we don't have anywhere near as many rocks to hit.  I fished with out one or with nothing more than a flasher for years and did OK. They speed up the process of getting on likely spots, but that can be done with out one, it just takes more time."
795520,sauce,2013-06-29 07:26:00,219,Without electronics you fish more random patterns and it can be difficult to repeat.  Knowing that the depth changed by a foot where you caught a fish can help you zero in on a slight transition they are holding on. Figure out a way to stay in the zone longer and repeat. Can be done with marker buoys but electronics make it faster.
795522,bigugli,2013-06-29 07:41:00,6138,"I grew up without electronics, and still have only limited use for them. I do admit they are a great resource for unravelling the secrets of a new body of water."
795523,fishindevil,2013-06-29 08:02:00,6254,Well for bass and muskies no problem walleyes with bottom bouncers no problem !!!! But for salmon or Great Lakes trout and deep inland lakes for lakers it would be just a guess cause as noted above. By another member gotta find the temp and the thermocline and that's hard !!!! Although years ago we used to drop a glass thermometer over board and do temp checks the hard way !!!  Just took longer to figure them out !!!! I did learn to fish long before I ever had a graph so I would do ok !!!!!
795558,Fisherpete,2013-06-29 14:23:00,1814,As long as I have a paper map I can do without. However I do like seeing the bottom structure in various depths.  Pete
795559,GBW,2013-06-29 14:43:00,8460,"in one word ""YES"" because I do it all the time.  It's always me, the gear and boat and that's about it.  I do have a sonar but never use it.  I MIGHT look at a chart plotter sonar combo one day...  HAHA"
795562,4x4bassin,2013-06-29 14:54:00,1025,I could do without no problem and I do except for jigging deep water lake trout . Watching the lakers chase your bait in deep water is a blast !  
795568,tb4me,2013-06-29 16:17:00,3295,I fish the Trent and Grand rivers.. electronics are useless other then water temps
795570,capt_hooked,2013-06-29 16:28:00,212,Electronics are fun to play around with when the fish are not biting..
795607,Rich,2013-06-29 21:03:00,3927,Electronics are for ice fishing.
795613,Joeytier,2013-06-29 21:46:00,3990,"I can think of many instances where i was without electronics and wouldve benefitted greatly from it, and conversely can think of just as many trips where i was equipped and didnt have a use for it.  Itll certainly help you figure out a new body of water much quicker"
795615,danc,2013-06-29 21:56:00,4677,"I fish in 6 feet of crystal clear water. I can see bottom just fine without electronics.  I only use depth readings when running over unknown waters, which isn't often."
795617,MCTFisher9120,2013-06-29 22:02:00,3761,"More of something to refer to. I've always been a visual fisherman picturing points coming out, logs, eying a weedline or edge. After using a Humminbird the other week water temp's play a big role. Used them lot's and build a pattern around them. As for finding bass not so much yet, market 1 or 2 rock piles driving around you can see your speed and cruise a little better...Guess I need Structure Scan to really get the jist of things"
