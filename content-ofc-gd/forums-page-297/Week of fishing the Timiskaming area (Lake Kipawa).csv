796534,tbayboy,2013-07-05 00:27:00,1497," Definitely pet friendly. There's a camp dog and one of the couples in another cottage had their dog there as well.  We were just under $2K all in for the week when you include fees, fishing license, tax, gas for the drive up and food. There's lots of lodges on the lake so I'm sure you can find something that works well but I can definitely recommend 3 seasons - Reggie's a great guy."
796546,lunkerbasshunter,2013-07-05 02:04:00,2585,great report!  Is it me or was there some blue in that first fish???
796553,smitty55,2013-07-05 02:15:00,928,Check out kipawa.net for a start. It's a great site imo with tons of info in the forums as well. Cheers
796583,tbayboy,2013-07-05 11:12:00,1497," Yep, they have quite a lot of blue and green colouration. I wouldn't claim they're blue walleye - the main body is still gold but the fins on the bigger fish are often blue/green.  Very cool looking.   Definitely a great place to start - lots of helpful folks there."
796603,RangerGuy,2013-07-05 14:25:00,564,Awesome we are gonna give it a try this fall on thanksgiving long weekend. Anybody duck hunt on Kipawa?

795813,Joeytier,2013-07-01 00:10:00,3990,Good stuff!  Looks like you had an awesome time.  The bugs have certainly been terrible the last 2 or so weeks.
795815,laker19,2013-07-01 00:23:00,13,Nice job.  If you're catching walleye every day you're doing all right
795817,spincast,2013-07-01 00:31:00,3279,"Looks like you guys had a lot of  fun and caught some nice  fish, that first pic is a beaut   Kipawa is becoming one of those "" on-the-radar"" spots - thanks for posting"

795838,northernpike56,2013-07-01 02:51:00,717,my friend goes to kipawa every year as well. he claims (and has pics to back it up) that it is also a very good lake trout lake when the walleye arent biting. I know he also uses jigheads a lot of the time and also trolls for walleye too. nice report!
795871,corvette1,2013-07-01 11:54:00,1765,awesome trip nice eyes congrats

795925,Jds63,2013-07-01 18:01:00,1365,"Great report , beer battered walleye and the picnic in the boat looked real nice ..."
795934,tbayboy,2013-07-01 18:49:00,1497," Yep, lakers are a big draw as well. I don't think you see anything like Simcoe size but it's a great way to spend the afternoon when the suns too high for the walleye bite. One Quebec gentlemen that was out this year did nothing but laker fishing (trolling spoons down main channels)."
795986,smitty55,2013-07-02 02:55:00,928,"Kipawa is my favorite place in my small world. I love it!! My best fishing vacations happened there along with great partying back in the day as we usually had 2-3 cabins at Corbeau Lodge at first and then moved to Alwaki lodge as it was better suited to our needs. Kinda funny, back when we were going to Kipawa it was mostly about Lakers but I realized after a while the value of late evening walleye fishing and party hearty later. My pb pickerel of over 11lb. came at 10:30 pm in the back corner of Corbeau Island. My partner caught a 10.5 lb Grey that week too, so we won the whole weekly lodge derby for biggest pickerel and trout and made some good coin. All out of my 14 ft tinny lol. I know the ""Hub""section best and down to Hunters Lake area. Never caught or ever even heard of a smb being caught. I hope they stay in the Laniel end  as I can't see how they wouldn't hurt the Walleye fishery.  TbayBoy we always caught plenty of 3lb+ picks and enough 5lb.+ to gloat over around the table lol. I know 3 Seasons is a good camp but its at the top end of the whole system. By being in the ""hub"" section of Kipawa, which is the best part of the system IMO, your options are far greater for travel in many directions for exploration. Plus I think you will catch more larger fish. I frequent Kipawa.net and I faithfully read the many reports every year. Great site.Tons of info on techniques for up there too. Many, Many Americans are totally in love with Kipawa and travel days to go there. I know why, and it's only a 5 hour trip for me.  Best advice I could give you would be to check out Alwaki Lodge for next year. You won't regret it. Cheers"
795990,Marko,2013-07-02 03:41:00,854,Awesome report! I fished Kipawa for about 3 summers in a row and its a great fishery. A very good friend of mine owns a lodge up that way. Its a special place....impossible for me to get drunk up there for some reason. I plan on going back at least once this summer and once in the fall. And yes there are some HUGE pike there. Quick story:One morning we are eating breakfast on the dock and we see a school of fall fish swim right underneath us. So i jokingly say watch a big pike come out now. There is a big rock about 10 feet  away and what do you know a monster comes from right behind and torpedoes right through the school. It was awesome to see
796138,Skud,2013-07-02 23:16:00,739,Nice!
796244,ccmtcanada,2013-07-03 12:15:00,7971, What the heck were you thinking?? LOL.  Great report Sean!  Looks like a great time...and perfect to share it with your better looking half!!!
796299,Rod Caster,2013-07-03 18:23:00,5784,Nice blue walleye! Great report and fish-food shots
796329,JoshS,2013-07-03 21:01:00,729,Mmmmm fried walleye nuggets...  Looks like a good trip.
796331,Rich Clemens,2013-07-03 21:07:00,3131,Always a nice get-away and fresh fish for dinner.    Sweet
796353,tbayboy,2013-07-03 23:29:00,1497, It's all part of the deal Cliff - gotta keep her happy so that there's a next year on Kipawa  Thanks for the replies everyone.  Only 4 weeks til Rainy Lake in NW Ontario - twitching already!
796483,RangerGuy,2013-07-04 20:23:00,564,Great report and awesome pictures!!! I've been contemplating trying this lake for a few years now. My wife and I always go to Nip but I think I will try kip this fall after reading your report.  Do you if the lodge you stayed at allows dogs and how are their prices?
796490,Joeytier,2013-07-04 21:11:00,3990,"Theres many reasonable priced lodges on kipawa.  Cant answer your question only that you wont have a problem finding a decent, pet friendly place."
