787892,gino,2013-05-22 02:01:00,400,"Hi everyone! This is our second year on Wicksteed lake for the opener. Last year was total walleye skunk, just pike and OOS smalmouth bass. This year we kinda knew some spots that might hold good numbers of walleye, so we went there and paid of. My friend, Ifish4real got his personal best walleye, a hefty 28 in beauty. Overall was a very good trip, saturday was the best day but sunday morning rain and a cold front shutting down the fish...next year we hope to get more. And here's some pics...                            ...until next opener...tight lines everyone!  Cheers!  Gino "
787895,Muskieman,2013-05-22 02:03:00,2472,very nice !
787896,Joeytier,2013-05-22 02:03:00,3990,Wicksteed is a beautiful lake...i should get over there and fish it some day.  That pickeral is a TANK
787903,Moosebunk,2013-05-22 02:37:00,3970,"OK... couple wicked Wicksteed'er eyes, place looks mint... and now I'm hungry before bed.  Thanks!"
787905,Nipfisher,2013-05-22 02:39:00,2449,Solid walleye for that lake. Beautiful colours. High water must have helped out with some of the rocks. Were you camped on the back side of the island as you get to Lenards Bay? Looks like that is where your boat is landed in the 1st picture. Lets talk before you go again and I should be able to help you out with some more spots. I have fished it about 10 times and 4 of them was opening weekend.
787931,fishindevil,2013-05-22 07:30:00,6254,Nice fish man !!!! Great opener and a new pb !!!!! Cheers

787947,NAW,2013-05-22 11:18:00,4022,"Very nice man!  I've only been once, and it was during the turn over late in the fall.  Got skunked on eyes....  Next time!"
787953,Roy,2013-05-22 11:54:00,13728,What a great report! You gotta love a place where pike are prey to walleye.
787959,Rod Caster,2013-05-22 12:34:00,5784,"Good stuff Gino! I could only fish the Monday which was also cold and windy; got a few pike... That 28"" is saweet!"
788052,spincast,2013-05-22 21:43:00,3279,Nice report - and a couple beauty 'eyes there. Congrats on the PB
788073,mattyk,2013-05-22 23:56:00,2110,Nice walleye!
788074,tbayboy,2013-05-23 00:04:00,1497,"That paper plate has me drooling.  Looks like a great place, thanks for the report."
788077,laker19,2013-05-23 00:13:00,13,Hey nice job.  Missed the northern opener this year due to work schedule.  Couple more weeks..........
788100,gino,2013-05-23 01:32:00,400,"Thanks Nipfisher! We still don't know the lake very well, but thanks to Chad I used some intel he gave me last year and applied way much better this year. I thought too that high water will be a help but still some rocks unmarked put us in some trouble and the propeller has to be changed...  . Where you see the boat is right at the ""ramp"", beside the dam. Will sure talk about next time before we plan to go there. Cheers!"
788101,gino,2013-05-23 01:36:00,400,"Thank you Chad! Your help from last year really paid of this year...the lake is really a gem. The 28"" went back in to the water, where he belongs...  . I was really surprised to see the effect  of that cold front on the fish mood...they sure shut down on sunday."
788102,gino,2013-05-23 01:38:00,400,"thank you Mike! i sure follow all your reports, they're awesome...bring some more, please"
788103,gino,2013-05-23 01:40:00,400,"Thanks guys! Was really a good opener, i wish we could stay more days...maybe next year"
788153,Squid,2013-05-23 11:44:00,1656,"Nice stuff Gino!! Yeah you need to know the ""path"" into the open part of the lake from the dam or you will get smacked. How were the bugs and how was the boat traffic for opener?"
788161,oldphart,2013-05-23 12:41:00,665,"~~~~AAAAH know the lake well, and have camped on that island also, but never caugh anythung like those sizes"
