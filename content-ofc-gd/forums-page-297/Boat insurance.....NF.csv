785463,wallyboss,2013-05-09 16:17:00,1095,Just curious of why not thru the House Insurrances??
785473,gburdzin,2013-05-09 17:12:00,32," My understanding is...if you ever have to make a claim for your boat that's insured on your home policy, it counts as a claim on your home, and sometimes the insurance company will refuse to renew your home (or at least put you in a high risk category - more $$$) if you have several recent claims."
785552,davey buoy,2013-05-09 22:17:00,5505,"Insurance is quite a racket isn't it?,you pay premiums to insure something at a set amount,then,if by chance you have to use it for what you pay for it. Most times they raise your premiums after a claim.I don't know how they get away with it?"
785554,misfish,2013-05-09 22:26:00,29133,"And here I thought I converted you to walking and getting in good shape,fishing the rivers and streams.  Oh wait,you have a new boat coming. Im,  I had my boats  with state farm. Think I paid $360 or so,,for a 12 month coverage."
785690,Sinker,2013-05-10 16:19:00,8692,"I'm with davey buoy, insurance is the biggest scam going. You pay for it your whole life on just about everything you own, but when you actually need it, they still bend you over and try to screw you any way they can, and then raise your rates! Its criminal!"

796705,Terry,2013-07-05 22:39:00,14456,"ok I called about 6 companies on your recommendations  one asked me who I had my house insurance with and that I should go with them rather then giving me a quote...this was a broker  most said they would call me back, 2 did not,  one said she did not get around to it and the other said they left a message with the person who answered the phone,(cell phone never leaves my side ) so liar my insurance company get me a price 1040.00  statefarm  broker tupling  gave good price 680.00  but did not know much about boats and had to call me back every time I asked a question  NautiMax gave me a price first time I phoned , knew the lingo had the answer to every question   660.00 agreed value so for 14 years if the boat disappears I get new boat price  and they are who I went with   thanks everyone for the help"
796707,fishindevil,2013-07-05 23:03:00,6254,That price isn't too bad terry considering its brand new and you got full replacement value with no depreciation !!! That sounds pretty good to me I think you did well I called around to many as well and some company's were right out to lunch and some would not honour a replacement even for their higher premium  ??? what the hell.   It's all a scam for sure did you ask about any electronics or add ons usually they want to know and will raise your premium some will only cover the boat motor and trailer and not any items you install or put in your boat !!!! That's covered under your home policy !!!! It's ridiculous for sure !!!! Grrrr frustrating to say the least !!!!! How's the new boat running ?? Done the break-in yet???
796711,Dan668,2013-07-05 23:32:00,1120,"Which broker quoted you for nautimax? Just curious as the quote seems a bit high, i guess it depends on your deductibles, and the value you listed for your boat.  Have you found the max speed? What prop are you using?"
796713,Terry,2013-07-06 00:06:00,14456,"Leia Moreau Northstar Marine Insurance Inc. 92 Caplan Ave Suite 270 Barrie, ON L4N 0Z7 you can do it all on-line http://www.northstarinsurance.ca/  I thought it was a good deal  I have a 19p aluminum , I have not tried anything else yet  but will, still in the break in period so can't throttle out too much yet"
796714,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-06 00:11:00,10439,Still in the break in period? My new motor is 3 weeks old and I now have about 50 or 60 hours on it!!!!
796716,Dan668,2013-07-06 00:31:00,1120,"The 19P black max is pretty good. Stainless isn't worth it for the size of motor imo, The quicksilver nemesis (same as merc spitfire) is definitely worth a buy. Better hole shot and handling. Same top speed. Paid under 200. Figured id let you know incase you were looking at other props. This is with the 115 opti."
796719,kickingfrog,2013-07-06 00:48:00,8333,Says the guy with 24 hours of daylight.
796732,Dutch,2013-07-06 01:14:00,831,"That sounds like a decent price, Terry.  My boat is older - a 2007, but a larger motor - 150HP, I pay about the same as you, also through NautiMax."
784525,Terry,2013-05-05 22:15:00,14456,"so who has inexpensive insurance on boats costing over $30,000.00  I am looking for complete coverage what company should I check out  and how much should I expect to pay  I never bother with it but think I should get in on the new boat  georgian bay has b lots of hazards now thank"
784526,Roy,2013-05-05 22:22:00,13728,"Go with someone who specializes in boats, Terry. Make sure you're covered for 12 months of the year....not just the boating season."
784529,irishfield,2013-05-05 22:29:00,26272,"Yacht Works via Royal Sun Alliance... through your broker that looks after you house/truck what ever, but you don't want it ON your house policy.. especially YOU! lol  Agreed replacement value on the boat if it's stolen. Agreed value on trailer for same..... agreed value on a kicker (hull only covers the main motor) and liability insurance.  I suspect you'll pay about $600 a year. I pay $860 + tax on mine."
784530,Dan668,2013-05-05 22:36:00,1120,"I am with April Marine, formerly Marine Experts. I pay $414 for complete coverage for a boat over 30000. I only checked with Northstar and Statefarm and a few other small brokers (cant remember any names) and found they were priced the best. May look around this year to see what others are offering.  **$448. Forgot that my premium went up last year."
784531,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-05 22:38:00,10439,I had coverage through Dominion of Canada when I lived in Ontario. For my $20K (1991 $$$$) boat cost was in the $350/year range. And that was full coverage/replacement. My broker was Meadowvale Ins. Brokers in Streetsville.
784532,Joey,2013-05-05 22:41:00,9122,"We pay $846 with Intact Insurance.  Full replacement etc., 12 months a year."
784533,Joey,2013-05-05 22:42:00,9122,Did I miss the thread on the new boat???
784534,Terry,2013-05-05 22:44:00,14456,thanks  I am with state farm for everything else but didn't like what they wanted to charge for ins on my last boat  good info so far ..thanks
784535,Dan668,2013-05-05 22:46:00,1120,Statefarm quoted me almost double.
784536,Terry,2013-05-05 22:46:00,14456,  yeah I missed it too...lol  it's a 2013 lund 18ft impact with a 125 optimax on it
784537,Terry,2013-05-05 22:48:00,14456,"yeah, if they didn't just pay a lot to repair after the fire, I would drop them completely, but they were so easy to deal with I will stick with them for home insurance ...for now"
784539,Dan668,2013-05-05 22:54:00,1120,"Nice, you'll like the impact. Enjoying the boat.  Heres a few listed from bfb, a recent thread:  Premier, Nauti Max, Mitchell and Abbott. Some others for you to look at."
784544,Joey,2013-05-05 23:01:00,9122, Nice!!! Congrats bud!  Can't wait to see it
784546,Terry,2013-05-05 23:06:00,14456,me too  they tell me June 1..but I have been holding off selling my old boat just in case they change the date till oct or something
784547,Dan668,2013-05-05 23:08:00,1120,"My Lund was delayed almost a month, wasnt impressed with that."
784549,Terry,2013-05-05 23:09:00,14456,"I bet  I will be some POed if mine is late but those that know me know my luck, so I prepare for the worst"
784550,irishfield,2013-05-05 23:10:00,26272,..the boat's not shipping with Propane aboard...
784551,Terry,2013-05-05 23:12:00,14456,"lol,, hell I hope not  I am running out of hair to burn  and I don't want the top to blow off  but thanks for reminding me of that day on the ice lol"
784615,lookinforwalleye,2013-05-06 11:57:00,4399,"No problem it`s only one of those little ""non refillable"" hand grenade bottles!!!!"
784654,Lunkerhunter,2013-05-06 15:32:00,455,some things to keep in mind.  - make sure there is no lay up period. many of the main auto insurers will have a lay up period in place for your policy. - make sure there are no boundary restrictions. again many of the main auto insurers will put boundary restrictions in place for your policy.  i recently switched from Intact as they had both of those clauses in my policy. Joey you may want to check that out if either of those are an issue. my boundary restrictions on my old policy were for southern ontario and great lakes. if i wanted to add northern ontario it was an additional cost. there was a lay up period between Nov 15 and mar 30. after speaking with many people at both my broker and the carrier i was informed this was Intacts policy on boat insurance. a majority of the other main insurance carriers also had a lay up period.  i found that Optimum Insurance Company offered me the best price with no lay up period or boundary restrictions.  good luck with finding something for your new boat.
784680,Terry,2013-05-06 19:16:00,14456,thanks good info there
784681,davey buoy,2013-05-06 19:18:00,5505,I'm sure learning a lot!
784789,Terry,2013-05-07 00:26:00,14456,me too
784909,brw,2013-05-07 16:14:00,101,"One HUGELY overlooked aspect of boat insurance in my humble opinion: get a quote on uninsured/underinsured boaters' coverage for you, in the event someone with little or no liability insurance collides with and injures you. Way too many tales of collisions on the water with irresponsible boaters/jPWC operators. And many never end well. I have 300K on my craft through Boat U.S. and it is really cheap coverage. I ain't much but I value my health more than my Lady Lund (just don't tell her that, though  ). Something to think about anyway..."
785166,LeXXington,2013-05-08 14:14:00,1928,NEW boat congrats!!.  I looked around because Statefarm raised my rates for 2013.  After checking with all the others I signed up with Statefarm again.
