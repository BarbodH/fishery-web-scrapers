796404,manitoubass2,2013-07-04 11:38:00,11391,There late this year up my way. Ill take the massive hatches of mayflies any day over a massive hatch of army worms
796408,lew,2013-07-04 12:34:00,12766,"About 15 years ago my brother and I spent a week up in the Gowganda region and there was a heavy Mayfly hatch that year. There were alot of overhanging trees with branches drooping right down into the water and the branches were completely covered  in Mayflies where ever they touched the water.  The bass were underneath the Mayflies gorging on them, so we started casting Chugbugs (topwater bait) into the mix and I've never seen bass fishing like that in my life. We spent days working the lake and everywhere we found drooping branches with Mayflies, we found bass galore.  I'm not a bass fisherman but must admit that was alot of fun."
796412,TJQ,2013-07-04 13:11:00,7806,We call em ShadFlies  http://www.nugget.ca/2013/07/02/shadflies-are-back
796420,BillM,2013-07-04 13:58:00,17367,"If the mayflies are hatching and you're having trouble catching walleye, try a slow death setup..   Worked for us a few weeks ago."
796151,Whitespinnerbait,2013-07-02 23:43:00,2038,"These hatchings, absolutely littered the lake I was out fishing on yesterday.         "
796155,kickingfrog,2013-07-02 23:46:00,8333,Looks like mayfly casings.
796156,BillM,2013-07-02 23:46:00,17367,Looks like big brown drakes.
796157,Terry,2013-07-02 23:49:00,14456,yup may flies
796158,Whitespinnerbait,2013-07-02 23:52:00,2038,Better photo....coming up soon
796164,snagged,2013-07-03 00:07:00,67,"I saw the same thing at Cordova lake last month. Hundreds of them, dead on the water surface."
796166,kickingfrog,2013-07-03 00:18:00,8333,Leave it to a flyguy to muddy the waters.
796178,grt1,2013-07-03 01:04:00,638,"may flies, got the same thing on our lake and the bite has definitely dropped off due to them ."
796179,spincast,2013-07-03 01:05:00,3279,they are the reason fishin is tough when hatch happens. Gorged fishies.
796184,Burtess,2013-07-03 01:15:00,901,"Yup, there were a lot of them when we were up at Marten River week before last too.  Also when I was in Midland last Thursday for work there were a lot even on the inside walls of the plant.  Burt"
796188,wallacio,2013-07-03 01:24:00,475, The adults have two tails.  Hexagenia limbata.
796193,kickingfrog,2013-07-03 01:34:00,8333,The hatch in North Bay is nothing like anything I've ever seen.
796198,BillM,2013-07-03 01:50:00,17367, The real fly geek is here!    :)
796200,Musky or Specks,2013-07-03 02:00:00,2710,The dreaded shadfly hatch.;Makes fishing tough for a while till the hatch dies down
796212,wallacio,2013-07-03 03:07:00,475, The one and only!
796228,wallyboss,2013-07-03 05:25:00,1095,Mayfly and they seem to be really late this year.  Usually around the 2nd-3rd week of May.  I remember doing my Scuba Diving license testing on the 2nd weekend of May years ago and there was a 3-4 inch layer on top of the water that we had to swim in!!!  GROSS and the smell was awful!!
796237,Rich,2013-07-03 10:21:00,3927,"In port dover we called them ""fish flies"" growing up.  They would cover every square inch of the town this time of year. Every car driving down the road had a disgusting continuous crunch under its wheels running over them.  We used to fill jars of them and go trout fishing! Haha"
796251,dave524,2013-07-03 13:11:00,4508,"I remember going to Dover as a kid , this is like late 50's, the fish flies covered everything so bad that evening that you couldn't get up the hill out of town, the road was so slick with them. Eventually, the fire truck tanker came and washed down the hill going east out of town ."
796298,Rod Caster,2013-07-03 18:17:00,5784,"This is a very confusing line hahaha. But if I'm understanding correctly, yes, the North Bay hatch can be BRUTAL! Streets and all of downtown completely covered in Shadflys."
796302,kickingfrog,2013-07-03 18:48:00,8333,I have childhood memories of car dealerships sweeping them off the cars and then shovelling them into garbage cans.
796317,bubbles,2013-07-03 20:05:00,591,"Come to Lakeshore, they are everyehere right now.  Worst in years."
796323,Parnelly,2013-07-03 20:26:00,108,"About 10 to 12 years ago there was a large hatch in North Bay. I remember walking out of the bar at about 2 am. Streets and buildings were covered in them, they were shoveling them off the streets that year. Lamp posts early that morning had massive clouds around them, I glanse over and there is a gentleman passed out on the street completely blanketed with them. Worst prior to that would have been around the mid to late 80's."
796328,JoshS,2013-07-03 20:59:00,729,Seen a ton of them this year! Spent a good 20 mins picking them off the boat and gear the other weekend.
796332,Terry,2013-07-03 21:16:00,14456,about every 15 years there seems to be a major hatch of them cause some of the worst fishing but also had so great fishing when it's happening
796335,misfish,2013-07-03 21:28:00,29133," I didnt see him say Shad fly LMAO  I can remember my first M&G at Lacair with Skud. The hatch had just started. Cool b an another member (man I cant remember his name. Big tattoo on his leg) Headed out,and slayed the eyes. We all followed the next evening,but nothing. The next day,the boat docks were layered with them."
