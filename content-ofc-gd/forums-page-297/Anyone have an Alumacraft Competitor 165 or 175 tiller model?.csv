796022,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-02 13:13:00,4399,I had a Navigator 165/90 yammy 4 stroke and if memory serves top end was 38/39 mph.
796070,mike rousseau,2013-07-02 17:36:00,4661,That wouldn't be a tiller....
796072,Roy,2013-07-02 17:41:00,13728,Navigators 165 were made in a tiller model but the max HP rating was 75hp.
796076,mike rousseau,2013-07-02 17:56:00,4661,That's what meant... I knew 90 was too big for a 165 tiller...
796086,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-02 19:37:00,4399,You correct.
