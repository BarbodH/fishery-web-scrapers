796438,BillM,2013-07-04 15:57:00,17367,Loons are awesome.
796440,Christopheraaron,2013-07-04 16:00:00,3525,yes.
796446,outllaw,2013-07-04 16:29:00,1232,"Lew chris meant there bullys of the water. they bully Canada geese,but then again geese can be obnoxious. hey I guess its a pecking order lol."
796449,Christopheraaron,2013-07-04 16:46:00,3525,"LOL, ya that's what I meant. I really hate when I'm carp fishing and they come over to eat all my chum"
796456,lew,2013-07-04 17:45:00,12766," Sheeesh, their just big pussycats George, ya just need to know how to talk to them    "
796464,Christopheraaron,2013-07-04 18:59:00,3525,"LOL, a couple years ago I saw a 3 year old try to ""talk"" with one, it came back and bit him in the back of the knee, and dropped him, guess he wasn't quite fluent yet, huh?"
796467,lew,2013-07-04 19:09:00,12766,Maybe the kid didn't offer him the right kinda samich
796479,Christopheraaron,2013-07-04 19:41:00,3525,"lol, could of been"
796498,Toad Hunter,2013-07-04 22:21:00,261, Maybe he was more fluent than you give him credit for- perhaps he told him off ?
796531,shane,2013-07-05 00:20:00,652,I got chased off one of my spots on the river by a pair of swans. I was walking the shoreline and came around a bend and they were right in front of me about ten ft. away (3 meters for you younger guys) They both stood up with wings spread and started coming toward me hissing and honking like mad. Then the bigger one lowered his head and charged me. I backed up quick and got up into the bushes and then got out of there quick. They were going to kill me.
796547,danc,2013-07-05 02:08:00,4677,I've seen plenty of Loons in my travels but have never witnessed a Loon battle. Probably a mating thing. A few times I've been fortunate to see a couple of hundred Loons in a flock in the fall.What an incredible sight.
796549,lunkerbasshunter,2013-07-05 02:09:00,2585,I had that happen to me on Ahmic Lake a seagull was diving at me.  I have a video somewhere of it and will post soon.
796563,danc,2013-07-05 02:47:00,4677,Ha ha ha. Seagulls dive at me all the time up here. They nest on rooftops right in town. One word of advice. Don't turn your backs on them.
796566,captpierre,2013-07-05 03:00:00,2521,I wouldn't dangle my johnson near a swan.  Would be a bad day
796109,206,2013-07-02 21:52:00,563,"On Mitchell lake Sunday morn and we were ready to pack it in, waiting for the other boat we were with, we seen a loon who appeared to be struggling. I thought maybe a pike has a grasp on him so we moved in to get a look. It actually had an other loon pinned down trying to drown it and beating it with its wings.....What a site!! Never saw anything like it in my days.  My natural instinct was to save the bird being attacked. That bird was on a mission to kill the other it didn't care we moved right up on it...I tried to push it off using my net (man they are beefy birds) but it wouldn't budge...i had to move the boat around and tried again this time it dove a few feet away and then came right back to attack. i gave the net to my partner and drove up and got him to scoop the wounded bird into the net.  We drove off and left the attacker with a soar look in is eye, The poor bird was beat senseless and we released it way down the lake, I'm not sure he could even recover but I had to try.  Looking back I wonder if I was wrong to interfere with nature in this way...it was human instinct or my softness that I couldn't let something be killed like that.  "
796113,Cast-Away,2013-07-02 22:00:00,790,"Don't feel bad, I would have done the same thing that you did."
796114,misfish,2013-07-02 22:03:00,29133,"I posted a few years back the exact samething. Two males fighting over a female. Go figure. At the end of the battle,we took the loser of the battle, back to the park. Called the MNR,they sent a local wild life place to take it into their care.   Sometimes,we need to help. Dont beat yerself up.You did good."
796115,Christopheraaron,2013-07-02 22:07:00,3525,"I wouldn't worry, sounds like you did a good deed to me"
796118,lew,2013-07-02 22:23:00,12766,"I'd have done the same thing too, but I'm just an old softie when it comes to injured critters."
796123,kickingfrog,2013-07-02 22:40:00,8333,"It would be hard to do but I would let nature, literally, take its course.  On a more humorous note I once saw a similar situation between to ducksâ€¦. in the spring. Took me a while to realize what was going on."
796139,Jigger,2013-07-02 23:18:00,1237,"Saw the exact thing a few years ago, didnt paddle hard enough, i guess. By the time we got to the scrap, the loser was long gone. Didnt see another loon in the area other than the two combatants."
796208,Toad Hunter,2013-07-03 02:50:00,261,yes but would the loon have done the same for you ?  jk. I would hate to come across anyone that didn't have the same instinct you did
796213,BillM,2013-07-03 03:08:00,17367,Nothing wrong with what you did at all.
796214,Rod Caster,2013-07-03 03:19:00,5784,I think you should have just let it happen... But... I completely understand why you did what you did. Hard to condemn someone for trying to help.
796232,Rich,2013-07-03 09:56:00,3927,"Dude you're lucky to not have been attacked, those things are mean birds.  They are very territorial and will drown newcomers to their lake occasionally. Once in a while rogue flocks of 8-10 loons will move onto a new lake and bully the current loons out this way too."
796233,turtle,2013-07-03 10:06:00,274,Loons are territorial and can be agressive.  Last year a male chased behind my boat pulling away from the dock when it thought I was a threat to the female and baby 50 m out in the lake.  Also had a seagull dive agressively at me when I got too close to its little island.  Actually was swinging a paddle at it.
796239,outllaw,2013-07-03 10:28:00,1232,great story. learned something t-day. I believe you did the right thing. guess they have not heard of the new thing ...bulllying
796249,206,2013-07-03 12:53:00,563," I wish I coulda thought it threw more this bird may have had a better chance in the hands of an expert   After the fact I thought the same....At the time I could only think about the poor guy on the loosing end.   Yes mean doesn't describe the look in that birds eye, he had snapped and wasn't going to stop til the other was dead....I figured it would scare off as we approached, Never thought it wouldn't care i poked it with the net.  At the time it never even crossed my mind my own safety.   Thanks I'm glad to know there are others with a heart out there"
796252,woodenboater,2013-07-03 13:15:00,2277,"While hard to see happen, I would have left it to nature to sort out. Last thing you would want is for someone in your party to get injured. As well, how are to know the losing loon wasn't the instigator and was getting it's due ?"
796263,NAW,2013-07-03 14:17:00,4022,"You did what you thought was right.  And I commend you for taking action on something like this.  I think I would have just let it play out, but that's just me.  I would assume that if the loon doesn't find a new lake, he is just going to get his    beat down again...."
796270,Jds63,2013-07-03 15:54:00,1365,"You did what you had to do ... thos Loons can be nasty, I saw one swim underwater right up to the dock i was standing on and snatch a duckling that was following its mother , what ensued was pure mayhem, but the Loon won and the duckling was gone, nothing I could do standing on the dock , i was surprised that a Loon would do that"
796271,Rich,2013-07-03 16:06:00,3927,"They are birds with solid bones and a hefty weight, they need to eat a LOT of meat to stay strong enough to survive... Sometimes this requires killing off the competition."
796275,Headhunter,2013-07-03 16:13:00,5703, HH
796377,Dave Bailey,2013-07-04 02:01:00,1641,"Neither right nor wrong, you just did what you wanted. Leaving nature to take its course would also not be wrong, just a different approach."
796410,jbailey,2013-07-04 13:08:00,866,"i saw this happen between 2 massive male swans on lake ontario around col. sam park - had to interfere as there were about a dozen people screaming in horror from the beach, it was pure chaos"
796418,Christopheraaron,2013-07-04 13:43:00,3525,"Should've let that one play out, maybe some others would realize what monsters they are"
796432,lew,2013-07-04 15:22:00,12766, Monsters ??
796434,BillM,2013-07-04 15:27:00,17367,LOL @ monsters.
796435,Christopheraaron,2013-07-04 15:33:00,3525,"Lol, maybe not monsters, how about glutinous noisy balls of fluff?"
