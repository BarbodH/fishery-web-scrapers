168801,cranks bait,2008-03-08 13:15:00,721,WOW!!!!  You're buried in the stuff.  Don't hurt yourself shoveling.  Maybe you should get the hot line to the army just in case.
168802,ccmtcanada,2008-03-08 13:16:00,7971,LOL Glen....  Still not as bad as here...we just had a 2 hour break from the snow...started snowing again.  Later today we are supposed to have blizzard conditions (by US Standards...Ontario's Blizzard standard means it must be -25C with the windchill...we wont have that).    Projections are over a foot of snow still to come.  Bly has cancelled her trip to Michigan....she was supposed to drive there today with our oldest.  Still though...good to see the snow all the way down there....haha.
168804,Roy,2008-03-08 13:23:00,13728,Glen Glen Glen....you're the only bubba I know who can clean his driveway with a hand warmer....maybe even a glow stick.
168805,Photoz,2008-03-08 13:24:00,792,"A REAL MAN would be standin' out there, bare-chested, fishin' rod in hand, showin' off a nice big striper!!"
168809,Clampet,2008-03-08 13:29:00,1947,"Wall, I'll be durned, snow in 'Bama!"

168811,ccmtcanada,2008-03-08 13:32:00,7971, LOL...yep...that's what I do.  I believe that we appreciate spring and summer more because of the winters we go through.
168815,Bly,2008-03-08 13:38:00,1556,Oh Glen......(    snicker snicker) I am soo sorry (  cough snicker ) to hear about the SNOW  (  snicker snicker) I am sure that with your strong constitution  (ROFL) that you will weather it all just dandy  (ROFLMAO) Truely Glen.....it will all be ok soon.........  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  This is what you get for keeping all that nice warm sunshine and showing off all those nice soft water reports!
168817,Bernie,2008-03-08 13:43:00,3190,Ha Ha HA.  I REFUSE TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY!!! You have more there than we do here.

168829,oxcowboy,2008-03-08 14:22:00,544,"yeah we are getting pounded with the white stuff here in southern ohio too, supposed to get 12 inces or more which is a huge snow storm by our standards. gotta go feed the cows, and then spend the rest of the day inside, makes for a good family day.  jason"
168831,John,2008-03-08 14:28:00,2956,Damn Glen you're killin me here. My wife is on the floor laughin'.....sorry bud but that's FUNNY!
168832,Tybo,2008-03-08 14:28:00,1373,Glen. Don't forget to stretch before you shovel. You wouldn't want to pull any muscles.
168837,Tdel,2008-03-08 14:46:00,393,"Hard to believe that you got snow down there and up here in the ""snow belt"" not a flake of the white stuff last night.  The winter storm warning is still continuing for our area but maybe if we cross our fingers we won't get hit.  If we do get dumped on today I hope we get as much as you did because enough is enough and I am ready for spring.  By the way I thought all snow storms come from Canada.  Lately they all seem to come from the south.  What's up with that?  Tom"
168838,ccmtcanada,2008-03-08 14:47:00,7971,Live update...  It's snowing like CRAZY here right now....LOL.  Here's the view from my front door....    
168847,HTHM,2008-03-08 15:04:00,4082,I lived through the blizzard of 77. Now that was a storm! This is just a PITA storm. Ran out to The big orange box this morning and drove like it was normal. GCD don't try that where you are as the roads may be slippery....
168851,Rich Clemens,2008-03-08 15:28:00,3131,Sorry Glen.  I just checked and my fan was blowing in a southerly direction.   I'll switch it around and pit it back north again.   Sorry about that ..... my bad.
168869,maybe,2008-03-08 16:11:00,307,"Oh man...should not have read this thread with a cold.  Rofl, hack, cough, blow, repeat....  Bly...really, REALLY well done on the snickering transcription.  GCD, we're just trying to be neighborly and share with our poor disadvantaged friends to the south.  We have so much, and it wouldn't be fair to watch you go without.  Pic taken ~1pm yesterday.  3"" of snow last night, expecting another 12 today.  "
168878,ChrisK,2008-03-08 16:38:00,2772,"Glen, Don't hold your breath, theres more to come......."
168881,nelly,2008-03-08 16:41:00,256,"Glen, do you consider that a snow storm down there (LOL)"
168925,Beans,2008-03-08 18:56:00,3339,Snow ??? Wachu talkin' 'bout Willis ???  This is the view out my front window right now with more coming...    This is the view I like to see...    (sigh)
168963,tjsa,2008-03-08 21:20:00,1578,"Heh, heh, heh....................................................................  :lol:  :lol:  :lol:  :lol:"
