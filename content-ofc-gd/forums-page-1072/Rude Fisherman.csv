169285,Rich,2008-03-09 20:24:00,3927,"I saw this guy out fishing a couple days ago. He sits there silent for a long time, not moving, very patient. Finally I go up and ask the guy if he caught anything. Rude little bugger doesn't say anything at all. I ask again, still sits there, ignoring me! As if I wasn't even there. Sheesh how rude. Not to mention he was quite the spot hog.  "
169321,Kerry,2008-03-09 22:23:00,383,"Seems pleasant enough from that view,at least he's smiling.Some people eh, you never really know what they're thinkin.  Kerry"
169322,silveradosheriff,2008-03-09 22:25:00,1025,Almost as rude as one of the jet skiers!
169329,HTHM,2008-03-09 22:47:00,4082,"S'now one cares about anyone else these days it seems......sad isn't it. One would think that we would have at least a trickle down effect of precipitous thought for one's fellow man. You watch this is going to snowball into a big ball of an issue, I think I need a tissue just thinking about the massive downfall of this attitude along our shores. On the bright side, however, we may be in for a warming of our collective hearts. Then this cold, unfeeling man will not have a snowball's chance and will have to warm up to the rest of us. If he does not then may he melt away and gladden our hearts with SOFT WATER! apologies to all"
169362,maybe,2008-03-10 00:25:00,307,That was painful...  ..but I gotta give points for effort!
169363,danbouck,2008-03-10 00:32:00,4380,  How long did it take you to think that up
169458,HTHM,2008-03-10 04:10:00,4082,About 5 minutes
169460,Tinman,2008-03-10 04:12:00,376,i think you should have kicked him in the snow balls
169461,Mike the Pike,2008-03-10 04:21:00,3421,  Ah Rich this guy is very nice and he has the right size rod for the season
169467,Ryan Landry,2008-03-10 04:56:00,128,"I would have called a CO, I'll bet he has no fishing license."
169593,crappieperchhunter,2008-03-10 18:01:00,2582,Ignore him Rich. He won't be there long. One good hookset will prolly tear one of his arms clean off. Then he'll be off to the hospital and you will have the place to yourself again. I actually feel sorry for him and those pathetic guns he has!
169599,kennyman,2008-03-10 18:36:00,737,Hey Rich. You thought he was being quiet. He probably fell asleep from watching Shelley and Courtney.
169689,Rich,2008-03-10 21:49:00,3927,I walked up to him today and kicked his head clean off! HA! That'll teach him.
169722,Mark Kulik,2008-03-10 23:02:00,348,Can't wait for your buddy to melt RichLOL I'm getting a little stir-crazy!
