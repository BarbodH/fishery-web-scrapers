169448,Mike the Pike,2008-03-10 03:43:00,3421,Well my wife picked up her camera the last 2 days and took quite a few picks as our March snowstorm progressed.  This is another one of her hobbies photography so I thought I would share these pics as the storm progressed  Enjoy.   A shot before the storm.   Now keep an eye on this old 1987 BMW that belongs to my 46 year old neighbor who still lives with Mommy and Daddy and does not have a life.Anyhoo The car will show the progress of this weekends storm.                                 Next day clean up by the owner of the dead BMW.   Yes my Tent Trailer is somewhere under this pile.   This is how the beemer ended up covered up.Its a rust bucket anyway.   After the clean up luckily for me I have a little more room to place my snow unlike some who posted picks of high peeking snowbanks.  Well thats winter folks I hope you enjoyed the pics.  MTP

169495,David Chong,2008-03-10 13:05:00,836,"Unbelievable! We were heading back from Winchester near Ottawa after completing a Bass Talk seminar session and it was brutal! There were cars, trucks, vans and transport trailers spewed all over the 401 & it's ditches. At Kingston they even pulled the plows off the roads and we saw why shortly as there was one in the ditch! Still with these conditions there were rigs just blowing our doors off going at 100-110kmp when we were barely doing 60kpm. Even the jack-knifed & rolled over rigs didn't deter these morons! We eventually pulled the chute in Belleville and grabbed a motel room as it had already taken us 4.5 hours to get that far! Hopefully this is the last of the big storms... Dave"
