169057,ccmtcanada,2008-03-09 02:05:00,7971,Don't forget to set your clocks tonite!  I'm liking the early change back to daylight savings time.  I'd rather it be dark in the morning when I drive to work and have it still light when I get home.
169059,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-09 02:07:00,1183,Thank you...I totally forgot about that.
169060,silveradosheriff,2008-03-09 02:08:00,1025,Ah crap - thanks for the reminder!
169062,fishindevil,2008-03-09 02:11:00,6254,And check the batteries in your smoke detectors too !!!!!!...very important everyone....cheers
169068,Greencoachdog,2008-03-09 02:18:00,8163,I hate daylight savings time!!! I'm a morning person so I like the early daylight... I say turn the clocks ahead 30 mins and leave them there year 'round!
169118,huntervasili,2008-03-09 04:33:00,1604,  I hear ya Glen! I like to see the sun in the morning... makes it alot tougher to get up in the dark too. Thanks for the reminder though Cliff I would have forgot
169126,huntervasili,2008-03-09 07:09:00,1604,Happy Daylight Savings Time! 2:00 went by really fast!
169127,Roy,2008-03-09 08:30:00,13728,"I thought for sure that turning the clocks forward would give me an hour's less snow. Well it didn't work out that way.   And yes change your detector batteries folks and don't say ""I'll do that tomorrow"" cause if you're like me, you'll forget. Another thing to remember is that doing the test button thing and hearing the beep doesn't tell you that the detector is functioning properly...it tells you that the batteries are ok. If a detector is 10+ years old, change it! It doesn't only happen to others. Log off and do it NOW!"
