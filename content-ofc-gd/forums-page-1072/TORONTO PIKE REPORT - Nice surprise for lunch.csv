169507,snag,2008-03-10 13:38:00,1932,"Thanks all,  This week looks good. Hopefully, I can get out for lunch again.  My wife noticed some blood stains on my pants, BUSTED!  Dang finger still smarts!"
169510,Greencoachdog,2008-03-10 13:42:00,8163,  Soak it in cider.
168599,snag,2008-03-07 22:23:00,1932,"So I head out for a very, very late day lunch (aka- fishing)  Figured the storm might trigger some feeding.  I was also experimenting with a new technique. I knew the pike were deep so I went to the deepest part of somewhere and experimented, ever so secretly.  Fishing around the ice was a hassle   Then the snow started, it was pretty  Then it rhymed with pretty but not as nice   Just as I was about to leave and sit in traffic for 5 hours......  There was a 10min break on the blizzard. Yay  I got a hit A nice hit lots of weight    She was fat and made the top 10 Toronto pike distinction   Now, in this particular spot, (the Mctrio R.I.P will lament) it is a challenge to land a fish with with help. Alone it's hell.  Luckily, I secured it's landing by engorging a treble into my index finger, thereby creating extra leverage. Got her up, and a crap picture: I'm in pain (clearly) and you can see the bloody finger   Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   Fishings stupid.  Now go shovel.  and shovel again.  S."

168606,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-07 22:34:00,1183,"lol...stupid fish  er   man.   lol     Nice fish, beauty fish...stupid snow."
168607,Roy,2008-03-07 22:35:00,13728,Great fish but can you please try to be just a little more careful? There seems to be a very much higher incidence of self mutilation while fishing this year than in years past.  Glad you were able to get out for a few casts though. And that IS a solid pike. Thanks for sharing.
168608,Greencoachdog,2008-03-07 22:37:00,8163,Excellent report and Pike porn Bubba!!!  Just thinking aboot a treble in a finger in freezing weather makes the ol' brown eye pucker so's you couldn't drive a straight pin in it with a sledgehammer!!!!
168610,Roy,2008-03-07 22:40:00,13728, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
168611,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-07 22:40:00,1351,dang snag.. im jealous of the fish/fishing but not so much of the blood... now that makes me want to head out too...dang..
168614,splashhopper,2008-03-07 22:53:00,2931,"niiiiice  fish, eh!  The onle thing missing in that lil adventure was a Timmies double double, eh!"
168619,kennyman,2008-03-07 23:04:00,737,Nice gator and war wound. OUCH!!!
168639,young_one,2008-03-07 23:44:00,620,HARDCORE...but then I wish I was fishing this afternoon.
168650,Joey,2008-03-08 00:15:00,9122,"Ohhhhhh, I sympathize with the treble to the finger, that smarts.  Don't eat red snow  That's a very respectable pike there, very nice  Joey"
168659,mepps,2008-03-08 00:44:00,1301,"Beauty pike, nice to see the slimey critters again!"
168661,ccmtcanada,2008-03-08 00:47:00,7971,"Great report Grant!!!  Yet another pike war wound!  I still have a scar from one I got over a year ago...mind you at least mine was from the fish itself instead of my own lure...LOL.  It's great seeing more soft water reports....all these ice reports, although great, were starting to depress me....haha."
168663,mattyk,2008-03-08 00:50:00,2110,"Nice looking fish, that looks painful. I have done that before and its not fun."
168664,tbayboy,2008-03-08 00:51:00,1497,Worth every drop of blood I say.  Nothing makes being snowed in easier to handle then knowing you got a nice fish before it hit.
168706,fatherof3,2008-03-08 02:16:00,1769,"nice looking fish,congrats"
168708,fishindevil,2008-03-08 02:19:00,6254,"Well another case of no pain no gain !!!!..  .now go and get some stiches already !!!!....cheers,nice pike"
168709,BillM,2008-03-08 02:23:00,17367,Very nice!!!  I hope this weather breaks so I can get some urban pike fishing in before the 31st.
