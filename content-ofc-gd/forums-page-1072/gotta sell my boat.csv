168845,fishless,2008-03-08 15:00:00,82,"hey i was looking for a web site more than anything,but the info on the boat will be going up in the classifieds in a day or two.jamie"
168846,ccmtcanada,2008-03-08 15:03:00,7971,Ahh ok...try www.kijiji.ca and toronto.craigslist.org
168860,fishindevil,2008-03-08 15:59:00,6254,"You canalso pick up a copy of the boat trader,or go on-line and see if there are any that are compareable to your boat,its just a starting point,and it might help !!!!...or like cliff said there is lots of boat owners here and we may have a good idea of what its worth...good luck    cheers"
168923,Jeff R,2008-03-08 18:40:00,94,"You can also try http://www.nadaguides.com...been using to compare pricing while looking for a boat..not sure how accurate it is, but at least it gives you a starting point...hope it helps"
168954,Guest skeeter99,2008-03-08 20:30:00,0,"I guess you should change your handle from fishless to boatless!!!!  LOL!!!   anyway it would be nice if you told us what kind of boat and hp, just dont ask how much for my boat unless we know what it is!!   it could be my kids toy boat LOL!!!"
168958,Crazyhook,2008-03-08 20:39:00,1154,some may be in the market.. fire up the specs!
168984,DanTheMan,2008-03-08 23:27:00,257,"Exactly!!!  Post here first, and save your self some time .  You have a great chance sellin it here  first"
168999,Big Cliff,2008-03-09 00:25:00,6899,"You are being ""Asked"" to post the details here, you couldn't have come to a better place to find out what a ""fair value"" is for it! Don't worry about someone getting upset about you posting the information here, if the moderators think it shouldn't be then they will tell you but since you have been asked all you are doing is answering a question! I am interested in learning more about what different packages are worth."
169009,pikie,2008-03-09 00:46:00,5,$5143.27.
169048,pigeonfisher,2008-03-09 01:55:00,696,How could you estimate value...does she cook and/or clean?  Maybe keep your boat and find your wife a single guy without a boat!

169190,Spiel,2008-03-09 14:50:00,9065," Hope I'm not reading to much into this Jamie?  Anyhow it's a beauty boat guy's I've seen her once when it was brand spanking new, little over a year ago. Give us the specs Jamie."
