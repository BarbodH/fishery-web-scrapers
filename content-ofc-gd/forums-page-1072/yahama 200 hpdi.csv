169207,bucktail,2008-03-09 16:06:00,1857,Can never go wrong with a yamaha! I have had 3 and not a single problem! Just make sure you follow the break in procedures closely as the high performance engines have very tight tolerances now a days.
169212,Guest skeeter99,2008-03-09 16:33:00,0,"one word!!!   BULLETPROOF!!!!!    like the old saying  If you want to get to your fishing spot  fast buy a merc, If you want to come home at the end of the day buy a yamaha!!!   it is true I guess, i had a yammie on my skeeter and never touched the thing for 8 years and ran like a top never left me stranded, I upgraded hp and could not refuse the deal I got on a merc and in the second year I had a couple of small issues(but it also never left me stranded) just kinda a pain in the ass  IMO  the quality of a yamaha made by (tohatsu) japan is better than most including merc, beefier lower unit and other parts  mind you the powerhead on my engine mercury is a yamaha design (tohatsu)believe it or not. not until you get above 115hp they are true merc's designed in the u.s.a everything under is just painted black and slap on a merc sticker, they just outsourced the engine development and production  think of it as dodge cars and vans with a mitsubishi engine"
