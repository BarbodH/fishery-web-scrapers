169075,SBCregal,2008-03-09 02:24:00,688,"gotta agree with the astro/safari vans my father has one that has hauled all his tools and parts for the last almost ten yrs, and almost 700k km on it with no engine or trans problems the last couple yrs of them had a heavier duty suspension, 6 bolt wheels and 4 wheel disc brakes"
169099,SlowPoke,2008-03-09 03:06:00,2984," That thing is a joke. It's ugly, underpowered, shakes and rattles and is slapped together without continuity. We used to park at an International dealer and I drove one when the came out. It looks like some guy got a deal on a U-Haul truck, slapped a pick-up truck box on it and headed over to the Flying J for chrome. It's built for guys that still felt inferior in thier Hummers. -Brian"
169101,Rattletrap2,2008-03-09 03:12:00,1652,"I drove a 2001 Ford windstar for work for a couple of years. It was more comfortable than the plymouth vans, but had a lot of mechanical issues as well. tranny went prematurely.  The most comfortable mini van I ever drove was the Pontiac Montana. same as the Venture by Chev."
169115,SBCregal,2008-03-09 04:25:00,688,"the dodge vans are bad for transmissions as well if you get one, do regular fluid/filter changes, and only use the chrysler specific fluids others claim to be compatible, but i've seen too many go bad using it"
169145,danbouck,2008-03-09 12:10:00,4380, My suburban is not that bad on gas
169179,bassslinger,2008-03-09 14:10:00,21,"I have an excellent 2001 GMC Safri SLE All Wheel Drive that I'M SELLING. Let me say that the AWD is 100% worth the extra doe. With good tires, that van will keep up to any 4X4. The reason it`s for sale is because we don't need 3 vehicles. Just a little info...White/ bronze 2- tone, 190 Kms, Fully loaded, leather with buckets all around, Running boards, dutch doors, tinted, tow-haul package. Awesome condition inside and out...6,500...worth every penny.  (705) 786-7646 (Lindsay area)"
169343,Mako,2008-03-09 23:21:00,25,"Wow thanks everyone, thats a wealth of info.  I will take all that into consideration when I'm deciding what vehicle I should go with.  Cheers"
169354,Rizzo,2008-03-10 00:10:00,4754,"this was a great read.  I've also got #3 on the way which means I'll be trading in the celica (last shred of manhood) for the minivan option.  Towing doesn't concern me one bit because a) my boat is light and  I never get to use it  :wallbash:  From what I've heard, the Honda is a beaut but can the budget accomodate it.  May have to get the Caravan (is it the cheapest out there?) and consider it a disposable."
169356,Muskieman,2008-03-10 00:12:00,2472,"My buddy has one of these ...they're getting more and more popular in North America "" the go-anywhere minivan""  Indestructible...3/4 ton chassis nothing underneath to hit full undercarriage shidplate...2.4l mitsubishi turbo diesel 4 wheel posi-trac...unreal for a minivan ... or any other comparable vehicle for that matter.  parts are getting easier to find but are expensive.... must get used to the right hand drive.  "
169370,mepps,2008-03-10 00:46:00,1301,Trading in the SUV for a van?!  Next thing you know you'll be trading in the boat for a dress!
169402,kennyman,2008-03-10 01:58:00,737,"Why not buy a station wagon? I've got an older Buick Roadmaster Wagon,but there is a Cprice Wagon and an Olds Custom Cruiser (hard to find) that are basically the same,just different trim levels. They are great,rwd and reliable.If you get an LT1 version they're quick (for a wagon) and get 26mpg. Just an option. Here's a pic of a cool one. Oh yeah, the second one is mine LOL  . "
169478,tinbanger,2008-03-10 11:32:00,1028,"Whats worse than trading the SUV for a mini van ...owning two mini vans  Not so bad really 99 venture , 259,000 km runs ok , except this morning with a puddle of tranny fluid underneath .Good news is it just the tranny cooler.  drove the 06 Honda today  Picked the Honda to tow the 17 ft lund with 90hp and all the teenagers (3) Most torque and HP ( I think Toyota has since passed ) of that years crop of mini vans and 4 wheel disc . People some times forget about the stopping part.  It pulls no problem although gas mileage drops ( runs in D3 higher rpm) which is undertandable. We launch several times a year at Ontarios steepest boat ramp (Pier 69 , Vistoria harbour) with no problems , doesn't even spin a wheel , where I 'v seen a Ford ranger do a very nice burnout   .  I think  for the boat you're puilling any Mini van will do the job , just prefernce I guess  TB"
169482,Greencoachdog,2008-03-10 11:54:00,8163,   Oh what a lovely Tea Party!!!
168950,SlowPoke,2008-03-08 20:22:00,2984,"Best minvan for towing... Astro/Safari. Most of us agree to that but before you rush out looking for one.... -intermittent wipers circuit board issues (cracks, factory recall) -heater switch relay issues (not the rayostat in the dash, $35 from APC) -vent selector vacuum issues (vacuum hose breaks over the manifold, $1.00+2 hrs labour) -fuel pump/sending unit issues (pump is $600 dealer, $150 eBay) -idler arms wear fast ($300 ea. dealer, $120ea. APC+20 minutes labour) -pinion seal/bearing issues (not a DIY job... $300+)  Those are the most commen issues that arrise prematurely. The good news is I made my way through all of them with a little help from the astro/safari forum online.  They are a great van overall but very little creature comforts as mentioned. I would highly recommend it for a family towing but not for a famly that will never tow a trailer.  On my '97 200,000 KM... -original plugs/wires, new cap and rotor -original headlights/brake lights/f&r signals, several rear marker lights. -original exhaust, just had the donut replaced a month ago -3rd set of tires two weeks ago -3rd set front brakes two weeks ago/still on 2nd set of rotors -2nd alternator 2 yrs ago -2nd waterpump 2 months ago -all shocks replaced (well overdue) 1 month ago ($13/pair on eBay!!) -all front end components replaced 1 month ago  Overall this vehical has been our best yet for reliability and low maintnence. We were faced with replacing it or fixing it a couple months ago and I decided to spend nearly $2000 on it. Runs and drives like new now. Even with original plugs and wires, it runs smooth and fuel economy has yet to drop off. 80L tank gets me 650km highway IIRC."
168960,OhioFisherman,2008-03-08 20:55:00,6623,"All of mine needed new plug wires around 100,000 miles, even the 2 my wife drove most of the time that were parked in the garage at night. Easy to tell hard starting when it is damp out.  Just my understanding a design change in the window motors a while ago, quieter but not as durable. My 2002 also has had some issues with the door lock actuators.  Like any car these days and dealer prices for labor, roughly 75 bucks an hour, if you can do it yourself it`s almost like getting the parts for free.  fan belt tensioner went on my wife`s 95 part of the alternator bracket assembly dealer only part, at like 150,000 miles though."
168977,Loonietoon,2008-03-08 22:38:00,1450,"I have owned 3 mini vans 2 were Safaris & 1 was a Astro all great trucks,  Wish I could have found another when my last 96 got hit Head On and drove it away but the Insurance wrote it off.   To much damage they said   I drove it away to the body shop so I don't no what they were talking about"
168982,Cookslav,2008-03-08 23:19:00,1457,"I Currently Have 2....yes 2 Chevy Ventures (2000 & 2005) I love my Vans!!!  I Would obviously love a truck but with 2 kids under 4, and one on the way.....I need room for 3 car seats  I use the venture to tow my Tent trailer, and my Boat (14' 40hp Aluminium Starcraft) Absolutely zero issues.  Last year I was told that the Ventures are the best rated Van  for towing that are currently manufactured. This came from a tech who works at Mobile life.... I Just happened to get into a coversation about this very topic while there once. So comming from a proffessional who deals in trailers I suppose thats solid advice.  But for the record the Venture pulls great.... I Almost forget the trailer is there once I'm under way LOL!  Its good on gas when towing, but....Beware of steep or slick ramps! Now that your using a Van I feel I should mention I have noticed getting the boat out can be a bit dicey if its a steep or slick ramp.....you'll only have the 2 wheel drive now  If your used to using a 4 wheel drive truck, make sure you give it some thought before backing her in. That being said I have had no issues to date but I thought it was worth mentioning."
168986,SlowPoke,2008-03-08 23:37:00,2984, Cost to repair exceeds the value of the vehicle. Early Hyundai owners know this all too well... resale value was directly proportional to fuel level. -Brian
168996,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-09 00:18:00,4399,"I drove a Chevy Astro for a few years back in the early 90's and while I had very few problems with the vehicle it was like driving a cardboard box, very unstable in a crosswind and virtually no traction. Can be a scary vehicle to drive in the winter."
169000,SlowPoke,2008-03-09 00:28:00,2984," We've never had a problem in the winter. Never stuck, no close calls. My wife just got in with it from work driving in a foot of snow... ""glad I had the van, not the Tahoe"". (She doesn't like the limited slip diff in the Tahoe) We have the extended van which will make a difference and run good all-season rubber. I'll take a RWD anytime for winter driving!!"
169005,Loonietoon,2008-03-09 00:37:00,1450,"I know what you are saying Slowpoke... put it still cost them in the long run as the Adjuster said that he had never seen a 1996 in the shape this was in and this was in 2004... Held out for $6,000.00 as it only had 102,000km.. Go figure, find a great vehicle and some people don't know how to drive and wipe it out for you #####*##"
169030,Greencoachdog,2008-03-09 01:25:00,8163,"Forget aboot the wimpy minivan!  Get one of these!!! There's enough room you could live in it if need be, and it'll tow a Battleship!"
169039,Mike the Pike,2008-03-09 01:40:00,3421,Honda Odyssey .Reliable that is what I have to say.  Mine is a 2000 EX very satisfied with it 135 000 kms and keeps on ticking .  Only changed the front shocks due to Quebec 's crappy roads.  Regular Maintenance and I had to change the timing belt at 100 000k  My Buddy had an Astro it is a good truck but man it loves to consume fuel.  With 210hp I pull a double axle tent trailer with ease and it weighs 2614 lbs empty alot more when the wife makes me bring those things we don't need  You don't need a truck to pull a 1600 pound boat .I don't even feel my boat behind my van .  Most V6 minivans will pull your boat .Too bad they don't make the GM Safari and Astro anymore.  I will tell you this my next Van will be a Honda  .
169040,Mike the Pike,2008-03-09 01:44:00,3421, Can't see you drivin this truck Bubba unless you are sitting on the Yellow pages trying to see over the dash of yer yella truck.  I can see the Tracker Danglin in the back while you zip down the highway not touchin the ground.  You could back up over Bozo#1 and 2 at the boat ramp.
169053,Nanook,2008-03-09 02:00:00,565,"My GMC Equinowx is rated for 3500lbs, and pulls my tent trailer with no problems. It does come with all-wheel drive but I dont have it. I'm no mechanic, but, it does the job for me !"
169064,Mike the Pike,2008-03-09 02:11:00,3421," Nanook Mako has to give up his SUV to make room for kids sure the Equinox is a fine tow vehicle but Mako is looking for Minivan opinions.  I myself would prefer an SUV or a pickup over a minivan but with 3 kids who all enjoy seperate seats it does keep the peace on long trips.  IF gas prices were not spiraling out of control I would be driving a Suburban or a Ford Excursion not a minivan.  Not too many SUV's have the space a minvan provides.  Ford Explorer,Envoy Excel,Nissan Pathfinder,Armada, all Have 7 passenger seating but barely any space for luggage."
