158839,Canuck2fan,2008-02-09 13:43:00,1444," Really? I wonder why there are dozens of people fishing it every day when the ice is out....  This is what the Ministry says about fishing there.  ""Have fishing opportunities for salmon and trout been lost in the lower reaches of tributaries to Lake Huron and Georgian Bay (Southern and Northeast Regions)? A. Fishing opportunities have not been lost in Georgian Bay and Lake Huron tributaries. Anglers can still fish all year for those salmon and trout species as they have in the past. The lower reaches of these tributaries are now part of Zones 13 (Lake Huron) or 14 (Georgian Bay), which have open all year seasons for these species zone-wide. It is no longer necessary to list these areas in the summary as exceptions where yearround fishing can occur. MNR will be posting fact sheets with detailed maps showing the regulations in these waters on the website.""  ""Maitland River in Huron County - between the bridge on Hwy. 21 and the bridge on County Rd. 4. Fish sanctuary - no fishing from Jan. 1 - Fri. before 4th Sat. in Apr""  Which looks to me to be the same as it always has been you can fish the lake year round and out to the bridge on 21. From Jan. 1 to opener it is closed from the 21 bridge....."

169452,sconceptor,2008-03-10 03:53:00,146,"it's open from hwy 21 bridge to the lake......these sweet new regs forgot to include the year round fishing opportunities in our area.........they grouped them into lake huron regs, but didn't publish that.........  they now include the old areas, like the maitland hwy 21 to lake, nine mile 100yards upstream of the lake to the lake(there should be a few lines or signs posted, but it's basically one pool from where it enters the lake), penetangore, main street kincardine bridge to the lake, saugeen is the old bridge abudments to the lake, sauble is just upstream of the s bend to the lake, or a few hundred yards(edge of the park) down from the dam to the lake.  ......all the same as previous years, they just didn't include statements about this in the new regs"
