156377,sharper,2008-02-01 19:07:00,279,I also use AVG and very happy with it. It automatically check for updates as well so very effective against new threats.

169129,Marko,2008-03-09 11:01:00,854,One of the better antivirus software out there is Kaspersky.  I had avg last couple of months and got a bug on my msn messenger and it didnt even detect it. Went bback to Kaspersky and found a trojan downloader on my hard drive.
