169164,Greencoachdog,2008-03-09 13:32:00,8163,Not too bad here: http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/...topnav_outdoors   ... y'all build a Snowman for me.
169192,huey graphite,2008-03-09 15:06:00,362,  I'm next door in Winona next to the lake. Similar scene. I heard the thunder yesterday as well during all that snow and was in disbelief.   Anyone remember the blizzard of '77? I was 7 years old and living in Chippawa (just outside of Niagara). Although the winds were much more severe than what we had yesterday....I don't think there was as much snow.
169195,BillM,2008-03-09 15:25:00,17367,"I was born in St.Catharines, lived there for 26 years.  My parents have pictures of the '77 storm, massive amounts of snow.  We got atleast 2ft up here in Barrie with drifts well over 4ft.   The plow left a 5ft wall at the end of my driveway lastnight, lol."
169197,Deano,2008-03-09 15:34:00,767,"Hmmm, I'm up north of Sudbury and we just had winds but no snow."
169199,BillM,2008-03-09 15:40:00,17367, Consider yourself lucky
169202,Joey,2008-03-09 15:46:00,9122,"We got it bad here last night.  The wind was just howling.  I took a quick video and picture.  Here's the video:    And, our table in the backyard:    Joey"
169204,Cookslav,2008-03-09 15:52:00,1457,Ya....we set a 24 snow fall record her in K-town for March A lovley 44cm of snow fell over the last 24 hours  I reeeeeeely am not looking forward to the shoveling right now.... I keep finding odd jobs to procrastinate the inevidable.....
169206,bucktail,2008-03-09 15:57:00,1857,"Great picture Joey! My back deck is like that , just finished shovelling for the 3rd time since yesterday.....man I am not young anymore. I have to go back out and find my recyclable boxes..... there under there somewhere!"
169223,Lungelarry,2008-03-09 16:57:00,294,Just a little north of Montreal  Hoops anyone?  
169232,RobHall,2008-03-09 17:38:00,261,"Here in Ottawa the all time record for snowfall is 444.3 cm (14.57 ft) set in the winter of 1970/71.  I remember that winter, because that was the year i moved to Ottawa as a 10 year old kid.  Well as i went outside this morning, my jaw just about hit the snow (it didnt have far to go).  I was in total shock.  I was looking at waist high snow drifts (i'm 6ft 5""), the cars were no where to be seen.  I knew they were under the snow somewhere.  This latest 48 hours of snowfall (starting friday night) brought 51cm of the white stuff, with about 35cm of it coming between 5PM last night and early Sunday morning.  Ottawa now sits at 407.3 cm (13.36 ft).  I think it's a safe bet that Ottawa will beat the all time record for snowfall by the time the snow stops falling later in march or early april.  My prediction is 475cm (15.58ft) will fall by the time it's all said and done.  I guess we can be thankful for the january thaw, as we would probably have about about 3 to 4 more ft of snow out there.  Here are a few shots of the snowstorm aftermath.....             Happy shovelling folks!!  Take lots of breaks.  Cheers,  FOTB "
169237,ehg,2008-03-09 18:10:00,2666,"Those are unreal snow piles Lungelarry, where north of Montreal are those pics from? Seems like a big storm from 6 inches in Dallas through 2 feet in Ohio, Ontario , Quebec out to northern Maine. Wow!"
169261,LundGuy,2008-03-09 19:14:00,169,"Mike where from in Montreal? I am from Verdun. For those who have never been there in the winter, the  streets in Montreal are famous for having snow up that high. The front yards are not very large and the snow gets sometimes up to the tops of windows on the first floor. The only way to get the snow off the streets is by snow blowing it into dump trucks and carrying it away.We used to toboggan off the back garage roof in the fifties and sixties.Folks here in Ontario think when we get 20 centimeter's or more we have had a major storm. Well my son just told me he has the ATVs warmed up,so its time for our weekend ride through this new white fluff!"
169265,Mike the Pike,2008-03-09 19:21:00,3421,
169334,Mike the Pike,2008-03-09 22:53:00,3421," I am from the South-Shore of Montreal ,Saint-Hubert about 15 mins drive from Verdun.  I willl post some storm pics later.  Mike"
169456,Badger Shark,2008-03-10 04:07:00,291,"Almost 60cm here in Ottawa and since Wednesday combined two storm totals almost 3 feet on the nose.  The pics from fishinonthebrain are what it looks like everywhere around the Ottawa area.  We have to use a shovel just to get from the front door to the car.  The side streets are only just big enough for one car to go down, if there is one coming the other direction you have a problem.  I went to my cousins today and my truck which I keep out there with my boat, is completely gone, I had to dig a tunnel to the doors to get in.  The rest of the truck was completely gone, my wife asked me where it was, I said right in front of you.  She thought it was just a huge pile of snow.  My truck is a Ram 1500 full size cab.  And my boat , well I couldnt see it at all.  All and all pretty incredible stuff, let hope we get the record."
169532,irishfield,2008-03-10 14:47:00,26272,"I keep thinking of moving WAY south to get out of the snow... maybe I just need to move North. No snow fall, or any depth for that matter, in Temagami. All we got was the WIND on Saturday. Almost blew me off the sled while crossing Cassels Lake doing 60MPH. Wind picked the sled up on it's side. I didn't even have to shovel the walk up to the cottage from when we were up there three weeks ago!"
169002,Mike the Pike,2008-03-09 00:31:00,3421,Wow what a snow storm here in Montreal.  Has it hit Ontario with a bang also.  Our lights keep on flickering we could be without power soon.  We are getting buried.With high gusting winds visibelity is Zero on all highways.Hydro Quebec reporting many power outages.  Lets be careful out there      
169003,ccmtcanada,2008-03-09 00:35:00,7971,"Mike...we got hit hard, but I was looking at some radar for your region and you are getting it much worse!  We had times of zero visibility, but not as bad as you.  Here are some pics from this morning...before it got windy.    "
169007,Greencoachdog,2008-03-09 00:40:00,8163,Has it ever occurred to y'all to move to a warmer climate? If y'all moved down here I could teach you how to sweat.
169013,Fisherman,2008-03-09 00:51:00,7201,"Snowstorms don't knock our houses over like tornados and hurricanes do, no thanks, I'll stay up here.  You can always add clothes when you're cold, but when it's that hot, once you reach the b.day suit, you're in kaka, and I don't want to see any sweatho....."
169015,Mike the Pike,2008-03-09 00:53:00,3421,"How could I leave all this great fresh water fishin for the US .No No No catching wall-ice has its price.  No moving to Alabanana for me.You can keep your Hurricanes,Tornadoes and earthquakes.  Besides I couldn't take all those Bozo's at the local Alabanana boat launches  "
169020,Greencoachdog,2008-03-09 01:02:00,8163,"  So when do you plan to start catchin' these fish???  We don't have that many Wall-ice here, but we're not overrun with Skunks like you seem to be Mike."

This was taken a few minutes ago from my front door...about 50 feet of visibility. "
169037,Greencoachdog,2008-03-09 01:34:00,8163,  Melt the snow to make water ya big silly!!! It'll keep ya nice and busy too!
169038,OhioFisherman,2008-03-09 01:38:00,6623,"At least a foot of snow on the ground here and drifts up to four feet, Cleveland Hopkins airport was shut down earlier today and not scheduled to open till at least 6 am tomorrow. Might mean flying delays in a lot of places due to back ups.  LOL got the snow plow driver scheduled for 4 to 6 am to do the drive tomorrow after the blowing stops. No place anyone had to go today to risk your butt going around here.  Tried to call Whopper, supposedly his area is getting slammed worse than ours, if it`s possible. Hope the old guy wasn`t old shoveling."
169044,Nanook,2008-03-09 01:48:00,565," Cleaned off about 6"" this morning,there's now about 8"" waiting for me tomorrow. I dont think my 'Blower can throw it over the snow banks down the drive any more. Then there's the roof to think about  T'ell with it! i'll think 'bout it tomorrow."
169045,Mike the Pike,2008-03-09 01:48:00,3421, Wow Cliff you really have alot of snow.  My wife has been taking pics all day .I will have the before and After shots.  Shawn I don't dig out I have a snowblower for that chore.I think the water levels will be slightly elevated this year.
169050,pigeonfisher,2008-03-09 01:57:00,696,"I am in Hanover, PA this week.  We got 4"" of rain on Tuesday night, another 4"" last night and some wierd hail and thunder storms here during the day today.  Lots of flooding down here.  When I was here in the summer it was drought conditions.  WIERD"

169088,Whopper,2008-03-09 02:42:00,2174,  LOL Paul and yes I shoveled snow all today    I wouldn't want to make a habit out of it though  We had only gotten 15 inches total for the year before this storm and we got more than that in the last 34 hours. No worries it's finally through.  It was nice to chat with ya on the phone
169134,Sandbag,2008-03-09 11:23:00,533,We got hammered pretty good in Grimsby here yesterday.  Yesterday around dinner time it was snowing harder than I have seen in a long loooong time. We also got some thunder and lightning along with the snow.  I will post a few pics once I dig out the driveway.  Lots of snowmobiles zinging around the roads here last night which is not very common around here.  Cheers  Craig
169140,danbouck,2008-03-09 12:01:00,4380,We got about a foot here with some massive drifts. Damn snow plow made it a lot worse though.  Saw a guy comin down my street last night with a lowered civic. Bumper was plowing the snow (ended up breaking) absolutely no snow tires on. It took him 45 minutes to go 50 feet down the road. It was quite funny the entire neighborhood was standed at there doors laughin ( a few of us went to help but when a big cloud of smoke came out of the inside of the car we decided to leave him be)
169141,OhioFisherman,2008-03-09 12:02:00,6623,"Dang what a change, sunny and bright here this morning  , plow guy came early this morning and the drive is clear! 55 f by Thursday, then another front and colder.  LOL Phil, just checking to make sure you didn`t try ice fishing!  1914 crashes here due to the weather reported to the highway patrol, day like yesterday? stay home!"
169144,Big Cliff,2008-03-09 12:10:00,6899,"Hello......Hello...... anyone up there? Could you pass me down a shovel? Yes, there is a house down here!  I haven't seen a winter like this since I was a kid, figures it's the first winter in about 15 years that I didn't go South LOL.  We have snow drifts that have to be at least 6' deep. Oh well, something to tell the great grand kids about.  On the up side of things, I just found out (and got connected yesterday) that we can now get wireless high speed through a company called Xplornet for less than I have been paying Bell for dialup. So far so good! Mind you, I am really looking forward to telling Bell to take a hike (if I can ever get to talk to someone who cares)!"
