169109,PERCHER,2008-03-09 03:42:00,787,April 1st for me also.I will just have to bring the snowblower to clear the ramp.
169112,mikeh,2008-03-09 04:00:00,824,"as far as launches go there is one at the bottom of Coxwell Ave by the beaches area, another is Bluffers Park at the bottom of Brimley rd, both of those are concrete and very good launches. A third one is in Frenchmans Bay in pickering on the west side of the bay, this is a sand launch (no concrete) I saw someone get stuck there trying to pull there 16 foot fiberglass out with a minivan. Those are the only launches I'm aware of.  at the beginning of April I will probably try fishing the warm water outflow in Pickering as long as I get my prop back in time."
