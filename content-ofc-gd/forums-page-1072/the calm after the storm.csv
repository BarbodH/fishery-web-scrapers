I had to call my father in law to bring over his snowblower (marrying his daughter was one thing but using his snowblower??? and I won't even mention the boat.). 4plus feet of snow at the mouth and no where left to put it.  Anybody ever see video of foxes/ coyotes/wolves pouncing on voles? Murphy mid leap.   no vole, but there is a biscuit in there somewhere   He's a 100lbs and that's all new snow.   Now where did I put that bone???   Good luck to all, I am now ready for spring."
