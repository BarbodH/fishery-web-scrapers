169368,huntervasili,2008-03-10 00:41:00,1604,"Hello guys... I have a hockey stick thats been collecting dust for a while and wanted to know a couple of things about it including who's signature it may be, and the value of it. Once I know that stuff it will be up FS on the classifieds. Thanks in advance for any help    "
169372,Crazyhook,2008-03-10 01:00:00,1154,"Ralph Carbonneau  rare stick he played in 2 NHL games and was cousins with "" Guy"" from the Montreal Canadians. He was cut from the team for having an english first name..."
169376,huntervasili,2008-03-10 01:04:00,1604,good to know...  any Idea what the value of it could be? Guess it really depends on the buyer eh. Really appreciate the help by the way
169390,kickingfrog,2008-03-10 01:31:00,8333,"Ralph Intranuovo? Oiler's draft pick from the 90's, only a handful of NHL games. I think he played (is still playing???) in Europe."
169401,huntervasili,2008-03-10 01:58:00,1604,"look like that'd fit the bill better... I and the T.... T is unaccounted for in ""Carbonneau"" Anyone else?"
169404,fishing n autograph,2008-03-10 02:04:00,2540,it's Ralph Intranuovo....put it this way....since he is considered a low end player you won't see more than $50-60 for it. honestly i would expect it to go less than that.
169410,Crazyhook,2008-03-10 02:10:00,1154,"  I had no idea man, just trying to get   somehing on the board for you and keep the thread up..."
169411,kickingfrog,2008-03-10 02:10:00,8333,"Keep the wood stick. Not many of them left, and even less still made in Canada."
169414,huntervasili,2008-03-10 02:13:00,1604,  Lol... Np
169415,huntervasili,2008-03-10 02:14:00,1604,  Will do and thanks for all the Info...
169459,jediangler,2008-03-10 04:11:00,1923,"According to the ""Hockey Database"" he's still playing in Austria.  http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php3?pid=2469  Poor guy had to play with the Leafs too"

169498,brickNblock,2008-03-10 13:15:00,598,This brought back a few memories for sure...... it was back around '66... Out in the old BayRidges part of Pickering at a Mac'sMilk we all lined up to get a free hockey stick signed by Keon and I believe a young Mike Walton.... After recieving our sticks we all raced home and played road hockey til we wore them sticks out. If only we knew better.... Thanks for the memory

169573,wallyboss,2008-03-10 16:56:00,1095,"Not worth a plugged nickel.!!  Wooden stick that old would break on the first slapshot, and signed by an unknown!!!   Use it for road hockey with a tennis ball."
169578,walleyejigger,2008-03-10 17:06:00,876,"would make a good tip-up, probably worth more without the signature,  just kidding, hopefully u get something for it, sometimes obscure names like that can fetch a good price if u could find the right buyer"
169583,Stoty,2008-03-10 17:10:00,2910,"You should try contacting ""Legends of the Game"" on King St. They deal with mainly autographs.  I have a fair bit of experience in the Sports memorabilia industry, and for a ""common"" player like that, unfortunately you would be lucky to get $50 for the stick.  But then again, there could be some hardcore fans out there, that would mean the world to. Something is only worth as much as someone will pay for it.  Good luck! *Stoty"
169594,Kirk,2008-03-10 18:08:00,347,"I saw a Carlo Colaiavaco stick for sale for 300 when he was going back oand forth between the Leafs and Marlies, to give you an idea the stick alone was a 200 - 250 value so the signature added only 50  Also without a Certificate of Authenticity it would be hard to justify higher amounts."
