169130,Rich,2008-03-09 11:13:00,3927,Almost had a chance at a day off today when my boss was so kind enough to come pick me up so I won't miss work today   There goes my snow day! Meh rather be at work than stuck in the house all day I guess. Killer storm though!
169142,danbouck,2008-03-09 12:05:00,4380,Nope! That's one downfall with the 4x4. Nobody will believe you if you say your snowed in!
