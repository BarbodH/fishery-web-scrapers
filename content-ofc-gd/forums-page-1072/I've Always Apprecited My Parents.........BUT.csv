I can only assume that all the photo brochures they looked at were taken during the summer!  Wasn't there any Carribean countries accepting immigrants...lol      It is a beautiful day here today now that the snow has stopped.  The sun is shining and it always looks beautiful with fresh snow.   All joking aside, I'll bet there are plenty of OFNers out there that have their parents courage and determination to thank for the opportunities they have had.  Sure would be a big step heading to another country and leaving all your friends and family.  Have a great day everyone  Cheers  Craig"

169162,Gawel,2008-03-09 13:24:00,27,The snow is just a minor setback for being able to live in this country.  Your parents and mine and many thousands of others couldn't have made a better choice.  Thanks for bringing that up as sometimes I forget how difficult it must have been for them.

169214,Sandbag,2008-03-09 16:42:00,533,lol Deano
169217,Roy,2008-03-09 16:46:00,13728," We must be related...my folks came here in 1634. I still have a clip of their arrival on Youtube. My dad's side of the family was English, my mother's side was French but they quickly enough were Canuckianized as they went to school in Iroquois immersion."
