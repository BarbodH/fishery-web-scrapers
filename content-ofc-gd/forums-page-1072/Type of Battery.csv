169357,Scott S,2008-03-10 00:13:00,203,This looked like a very good and  knowlegdeable group of people on this web site so I joined. I also just bought a boat and need some assistance in getting it ready for the spring. I need to buy a deep cycle battery for my electric and want to get some feed back on what type of battery to get. Thanks for your replies in advance.  Scooter

169367,Muskieman,2008-03-10 00:40:00,2472,"EH!  Usually a 27 series battery does the trick... If you plan on starting the engine with this battery buy a Dual Purpose battery.  If it is just electronics and or a trolling motor   a deep cycle is the what you want....  I sell Exide Stowaways.... I use them and have two for the last 4 years ....I sell them for 72.59$ # 27 dc700 I also can get you a gel battery..... money wasted if you ask me... more Warranties done on these than any other battery.  I sell ,,,  A/C Delco... Exide... Varta ... Penn State..Eveready Energizer.....none are better than the other. there are 3 major manufacturers of batteries in North America... the rest are just rebranded. when it comes to a deep cycle battery the life expectancy is relative....It depends on how often you use and charge it,, storing a fully charged battery for the winter has a big role in the battery's life. charging it every 2 months is recommended... at least test it every two months when not in use.  Get a charging system for your outboard... or a solar charger.  I just got back from a Battery  Expo... learned alot and have passed it on.."
