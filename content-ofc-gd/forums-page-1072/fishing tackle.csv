Some really old stock too, for anyone looking for some oddball, hard to find (old) colours etc. I ended up getting a Mepps Musky Killer ther for around $8 or $9. Can't remember exactly, but it was cheaper than around here. They had an oddball type brand of ribbon tail purple worms that caught me some bass at Murphy's Point. Worked great and they were on really cheap."
