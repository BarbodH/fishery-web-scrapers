168277,dwc67,2008-03-06 21:24:00,140,"good luck  should be good fishing, they drop the water level in the winter so the fish just head to the deep holes. the camp owners want the lake to be closed to ice fishing because the fish are concentrated."
168280,highdrifter,2008-03-06 22:16:00,2534,"Island 10?!  LOL The falls at the far end of the lake, closest to the route that leads to Maple mountain... forget what the name of the river was...  What a spot!!  Good luck Wayne..  I'm soo jealous!!  cheers HD"
168284,Radnine,2008-03-06 22:32:00,1538,A couple that I knew a while back owned an island on Lady Evelyn. They had a Tiger Moth (yellow biplane) on floats that they flew in there. Does it ring any bells with anyone?
168287,johnnyb,2008-03-06 22:58:00,3413,"knock'em dead, Wayne!  We eagerly await the pics"
168308,highdrifter,2008-03-07 00:52:00,2534,Lady Evelyn is one heck of a tough lake to fish though...  Hope you've got a depth chart Wayne!
168338,Fang,2008-03-07 02:17:00,1330,Hey Wayne  Keep an eye out  LE is known to get very slushy  I can tell you a few good spots on Diamond.

169379,irishfield,2008-03-10 01:10:00,26272,"Well we never made it to Lady E... That's where I thought we were going to a guys ""camp""... but we went East instead and toured the bush trails mostly.... and sat around in hunt camps shooting the ""breeze"". Did some very limited fishing on Sunrise Lake (Lakers), Lorrain (Pike), middle Bear and South Bear (Pickeral).  Anyone heading up that way before closing next week... you can drive anywhere.. on any lake in a truck (or car for that matter if you know what you're doing).. well except Johnnyb's POS with them city tires on it! lol  Mind you they're calling for rain Thursday and Friday."
