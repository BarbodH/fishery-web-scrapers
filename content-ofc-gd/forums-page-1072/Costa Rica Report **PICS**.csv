I spent my time there assisting with the animals and aiding in the construction of new parts of the sanctuary.  It was hot, and I'll admit this snow sucks, and I dont like being back in it lol.  But we had a blast down there, the animals were fun.  The construction work was exhausting, but we got through it.  We also had a LOT of time to have some fun, and do a bit of fishing.   Mark hauling some wood   Baby anteater that was rescued   one armed monkey, hes a sweetheart   having a bit too much fun   jumping the waterfall in Montezuma  and the fishing ....    first cast   not sure what this is   nice snapper     Overall we caught a lot of snapper and little jacks.  I lost a big tuna and a roosterfish, my equipment wasnt exactly big game equipment, but what ca ya do? we had fun.  The snapper were delcious by the way. Wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over the fire."

168916,mepps,2008-03-08 18:27:00,1301,"Nice, looks like a great trip!"
168918,NAC,2008-03-08 18:33:00,369,I'm envious!!  was supposed to go this year but the budget wouldn't allow it...  again. next year is for certain. any tips for people whom want to travel and fish the area? I'm personally more interested in the deep water stuff for billfish but I would like to get exposed to all the available fishing in CR. I heard there are bonefish there as well.  can you confirm?
168920,muskymatt,2008-03-08 18:37:00,2608,"I've been to and dived from the same waterfall, it's totally beautiful there.  I'd love to go back again....someday!!  Great pics."

168941,danbo,2008-03-08 19:46:00,2646,super-cool!
168943,Crazyhook,2008-03-08 19:57:00,1154,Steve great report! I was wondering how you made out!  I think the fish you are not sure about is a yellow jack. Good eating
168953,Joey,2008-03-08 20:30:00,9122,"That's just great that you would do that Steve, and you were rewarded for your efforts.  Nice fish and that little anteater is such a cutie.  Joey"
168962,steverowbotham,2008-03-08 21:07:00,1800,"thanks guys it was a lot of fun.  couldnt afford to go for sailfish, but yes there are LOTS of bonefish .... schools of 20-40 of them, but I couldnt hook one.  Maybe fly fishers would do well for them.  The tattoo is the G.Loomis logo, but its not meant to be like that.  My cousin had the same tattoo and he was killed two years ago, so I got it without hesitation.  Mark just happened to have the same one."
169046,Rich Clemens,2008-03-09 01:49:00,3131,Nice report Steve and what a great way to spend a vacation - volunteering to help a wildlife station.   Good on you.
