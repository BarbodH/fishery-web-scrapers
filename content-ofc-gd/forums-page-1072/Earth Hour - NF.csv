168445,ccmtcanada,2008-03-07 13:57:00,7971,"Conserving energy and reducing the stress on the power grid is in many people's best interest.  I do not want to make this a global warming debate, but rather simply ask if anyone has heard of this and how many are planning on participating.  Here's a little background.... (taken from http://www.earthhour.org/about)  ""On 31 March 2007, 2.2 million people and 2100 Sydney businesses turned off their lights for one hour - Earth Hour. This massive collective effort reduced Sydney's energy consumption by 10.2% for one hour, which is the equivalent effect of taking 48,000 cars off the road for a year. With Sydney icons like the Harbour Bridge and Opera House turning their lights off, and unique events such as weddings by candlelight, the world took notice. Inspired by the collective effort of millions of Sydneysiders, many major global cities are joining Earth Hour in 2008, turning a symbolic event into a global movement""  So, what do you think about Earth Hour?  My office is participating in this event...and our family will also participate at home."
168449,Cory,2008-03-07 14:17:00,170,"I'll turn my lights off for an hour, probably be between 2 and 3 am though"
168451,tjsa,2008-03-07 14:22:00,1578,"I am ""in the dark"" about this,  What day is this, looks like its Sunday March 23rd around 6 pm?"
168460,cthewrld,2008-03-07 14:48:00,99,"Earth hour is Saturday, March 29 at 8 p.m."
168467,Roy,2008-03-07 14:58:00,13728,Dang.....Hockey Night in Canada just took a hit.
168468,Casey123,2008-03-07 15:03:00,461,"I would participate, however there is a hockey game on.  Canadiens vs Maple Leafs  7:00 PM ET 7:00 PM ET  HD NET,CBC (HD),RDS (HD)   XM 207, 172,  my wind up TV is broken"
168475,ccmtcanada,2008-03-07 15:33:00,7971,They are only asking that lights go out...you can still watch the hockey game....LOL.
168507,Joeytier,2008-03-07 16:38:00,3990,I will be participating.
168508,shane,2008-03-07 16:39:00,652,I'm in!   We would normally only have two lights on at that time of night anyway.  So count me in for 120 watts.
168510,Deano,2008-03-07 16:48:00,767,It's just the governments way of polling how many will be willing to pay a carbon tax. I'm not buying into it.
168699,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-08 02:03:00,1183,I'm in...now if we could all just get together with the gas thing...
168724,Fisherman,2008-03-08 03:19:00,7201,"Bingo, you win that one hands down. Just saw a $1.15 for diesel, what are they nuts. And no, I'm not turning off my lights any earlier.  If the cityies turned off all the high rise office towers, Goverment building lights, etc, we would never have an electricity shortage."
168763,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-08 05:18:00,835,I'll probably be plowing 2' of snow in low range at about 2mpg.
168774,OhioFisherman,2008-03-08 10:56:00,6623,I probably won`t drive that day! Since I only drive like 1 day a week I am doing more than most?
168895,ecmilley,2008-03-08 17:14:00,2163,As far as I'am concerned it's more Bull I already recycle and use cfl througout my house and wouldn't go out of my way to turn extra lights off at anytime of the day
168897,nelly,2008-03-08 17:19:00,256,I will try and give it a go. Get the candles ready if it's to dark.
168992,douG,2008-03-08 23:54:00,2693,"I agree with the negatives.  How could turning lights off at any time of the day help anything at all?  I turn em on when I get up, and maybe turn em off when I go to bed, but not too likely.  More Bull, some sorta commie pinko plot.  I hate this crap, leave me alone.  I don't buy into anything.  Well, maybe the local energy provider, I buy into that, but none of this Bull about reducing the amount of energy I consume.  Ok, Ok, Ok, I'm a little bit afraid of the dark, but you still can't make me buy into any of this Bull."
169001,danc,2008-03-09 00:29:00,4677, HA!!! And miss COPS??? Not a chance.
169201,Tybo,2008-03-09 15:44:00,1373,If all the fast food joints would turn their lights off when there closed in North America. The saving on energy would help to pay for the U.S deficit.
