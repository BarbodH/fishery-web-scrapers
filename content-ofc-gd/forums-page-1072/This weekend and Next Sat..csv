My wife and I have only meet a few members here, we thought it would be nice to meet some more of you before the ice breaks up and we all head off to our fav. soft water locations.  Anybody up for a little meet and greet on the ice next Saturday?  I thought maybe posting now would give the interested parties enough time to organize...  Jen, Gerrit and anyone else from Hamilton, we could arrange a car pool if it was easier...  Thanks,  Michael and Michelle"
