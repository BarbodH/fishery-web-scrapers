310115,Radnine,2009-02-24 02:36:00,1538,Driving to the end of your street would be too far for a tiller.
310116,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-24 02:41:00,10439,Don't forget to add 25% for the exchange on the dollar plus GST when you bring it across the border.
310119,GeorgeJ,2009-02-24 02:42:00,207,"looks good at that price but it can still end up going for quite a bit more by the end of the auction. Also did you see the trailer is not included and would be another $395 US. Dont forget to due the currency exchange and call customs to figure out what its going to cost to bring it into Canada. Plus the gas to go and get it, I think it might end up too much money."
310132,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-24 03:27:00,2585,"no trailer, no motor, exchange gas to drive there and back.  May not be a deal for someone this far away  cheers!"
310140,steverowbotham,2009-02-24 04:14:00,1800,"my opinion ... no motor, no trailer, exchange, gas, taxes at border.  not worth it   EDIT: Apparently, I should have read the post above mine.... well, I'll second his opinion"
