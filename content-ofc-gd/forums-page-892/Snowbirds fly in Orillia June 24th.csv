Ahead of their June 24 show over Orillia, members of the Snowbirds aerial acrobatic team will be at the airport performing some pre-show scouting.  ""This is part of their pre-show protocol,"" said Ellen Cohen, board member with the Community Foundation of Orillia.  She said two Snowbird team members will be landing one of the demonstration team's show jets around 2:30 p. m. this afternoon, but won't be venturing much further than the airport on this sojourn in to Simcoe County.  Although today's stop isn't open to the public, Cohen said local media will be on hand along with several representatives from the Community Foundation.  ""Whenever the Snowbird pilots or planes land it really is exciting,"" Cohen said.  Of the team, three are no strangers to the area. Captain Mark Laverdiere is an Orillia native, team co-ordinator captain Steve Thompson has family in the Brechin area and technical co-ordinator corporal Eric Beauchesne is from Bracebridge.  ""We've got three fairly local connections,"" said Wendy Timpano, interim executive director for the community foundation.  Thompson is expected to be one of the team members to arrive today, she added.  The main event, being organized by the Community Foundation of Orillia and area, will take place at 6 p. m. on June 24 when the show pilots take to the skies above Lake Couchiching for the team's display of aerial acrobatics.  The entire team, consisting of the nine pilots, the necessary technical and support members will fly in on June 23. In addition to a reception being held that night, the foundation is working to arrange for the Snowbirds to do a number of public visits, said Timpano.

Donations will be collected to cover the cost of hosting the Snowbirds team and to raise money for the foundation.  ""There are an incredible amount of details we have to pull together,"" Timpano said. ""We're partnering with a number of people, and we've tried to pull in volunteers who are experts in their area.""  Those details range from getting the necessary air space restrictions to arranging for accommodations for the snowbirds during their stay. Timpano said the foundation is also working with the OPP to look at restricting boat traffic in the waters under the fly area.  As the day approaches, more volunteers will be needed to make sure things run smoothly, she said.  Despite all the work, hosting the Snowbirds is something the foundation is happy to do.  Today's visit will officially start the countdown to the June 24 event.  ""It's a great opportunity for this town to really showcase itself,"" she said. ""We are so excited. The board is really excited and our volunteers are excited."""
