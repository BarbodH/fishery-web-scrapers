310091,OhioFisherman,2009-02-24 01:05:00,6623,"Mike here is a jitterbug http://www.lurenet.com/productdetail.aspx?id=3721  they can be fished on a slow steady retrieve and make sort of a unique sound coming through the water, I generally never fished them fast also pause and retrieve. Not the best lure to throw around real thick weeds, two trebles hang down that will catch weeds. With practice you can swim them through some cover.  Don`t let us tackle collectors turn you into one, about 45 years or more of buying tackle for me and mistakes were made on tackle purchases. Time on the water will make up for some tackle, the ability to locate key spots where fish hold seasonally, a search pattern based on that.  Easier to do from a boat, but you can learn from boaters even if you don`t have one, what shore line areas are they targeting? are they catching fish there? time of day they are catching fish? breeze towards shore or away when they are catching fish.  Most lakes here don`t drop off too quickly, a pair of chest waders can get you past some of the shoreline junk if you are fishing a lake that it is safe to use them. I have caught bass a few yards away from me wading, just be slow and steady about it if you try.  Baitfish near shore? a good place to try, they are feeding spawning or trapped against shore by game fish herding them, shallow water is a saftey zone for them from other species.  Don`t spend so much on tackle that you don`t have money to use it. Any boat that can be used safely on the water you are fishing opens the door to more water to fish."

You select a few key items and the necessary bits of terminal tackle to fill 2 medium trays. Remember to have some downsized baits for tough bites days. I carry 2 rods. A shorter baitcaster and an U/L spinning rod for finesse. By the time you have 2 trays, tools, camera, tape, snack, bug juice, etc... plus your two rods, you have more than enough to carry around. You still have to be able to fish and move around comfortably without having 20-30lbs. on your back."
309064,OhioFisherman,2009-02-21 12:55:00,6623,"Very few lures that I tied directly to the line, usually used a snap on everything but R bend spinner baits and Buzz Baits, I tried to avoid them. Just always felt most lures get a little more action with a snap on to add a little more freedom of movement."
309077,northamfishing,2009-02-21 13:17:00,10," Yes we went to a more streamlined approach by eliminating the red tubing. The red tubing was a bit more labour intensive. The clear tubing i find is a bit more subtle and gives the lure a cleaner look. In my experience, I haven't see much of a difference in the performance. It was more of a cosmetic change. However yours would be the first case that has been brought to my attention. I am actually glad that this was brought to light as I am always open to feedback on our products. We are always doing research on how we can make the products better. Our spinnerbaits have evolved over the past couple years with help from our loyal customers and of course me getting out and beating them up by fishing.  Just so you know we do stand behind every lure we make, and you are welcome to select a replacement. Thanks.  "
309098,Beans,2009-02-21 13:49:00,3339," Hey paul...I use a small ring cut from some surgical tubing over the ""R"" bend...  Got me a lifetime supply when they removed the oxygen tubes from my wife after she had an asthma attack and threw the tubing in the garbage...I asked if I could have it..."
309107,northamfishing,2009-02-21 14:24:00,10,"I have a few years experience with ""R"" bends and closed or twisted wire forms. I have used them both and I have caught fish on both. From my understanding the ""R"" bends are designed for direct tie. Where the closed form is better suited for using a snap swivel or leader. I really think it comes down to preference and application. There are a couple different pros and cons to both forms. The ""R"" bend with a direct tied knot will most likely run truer a majority of the time where a leader used on a twisted form may give the spinnerbait a little too much freedom and alloy it to tilt to the side.  I also find that the ""R"" bends will bend more or ""straighten"" out more on a hook set. The ""closed"" wire forms I find don't open up as much and the wire seems to be slightly thicker in diameter.  I guess this why they make most larger pike and musky spinnerbaits with all closed forms(to my knowledge anyways) Vibration may differ slightly from these two forms, but I honestly think the blades are responsible for most of the noise and vibration a spinnerbait puts out. I believe that the motion of the blades displacing water is what fish sense on their lateral line. Now if you believe that the ""R"" bend puts out more vibration that's great, use it in application where fish rely on there sense on lateral line primarily to feed such as stained water. If you like using the closed wire form you may want to use it more in situations where fish might rely on there sense of vision primarily to feed, such as clear water. I really think blades are what makes a spinnerbait. If it's vibration you want, colorado baldes are the way to go. If it's flash your going for, then twin willow blades are great.  Or you can do what I do, simply do what works and listen to the fish."
309116,OhioFisherman,2009-02-21 14:55:00,6623,"Norm I have done that too, rubber O rings, surgical tubing, clear plastic tubing, heat shrink tubing. A hassle and can catch weeds a bit more. Rubber O rings have worked the best for me.  Hooked bigger bass and pike where a direct tied lie just slid on the shaft of the spinner bait and bent the heck out of the wire. Titanium wire spinner baits not much of a problem other than cost."

285480,Beats,2008-12-30 04:05:00,543,"YOu seem to have more than enough fish imitating lures in your box.  Fishing from shore I would try and stay with as many floating or shallow diving lures as possible.  As someone who has fished from shore my whole life, I heavily recommend buying some Mepps Spinners.  Get a whole bunch of Mepps Comets.  I think it's #4's that I like, the ones with the fly-like material on the hook.  Catch every species of fish you can cast to.  Pike, pickerel, sm bass, lm bass, white bass, gar, crappie just to name a few that I have all caught either in London or within 30 mins of London this year with that bait.  My favorite bait by far."

One thing i could suggest is a getting some spinner baits wih the loop to tie to like your big guy at the bottom ...  When fishing for pike and  I have a leader on I always find that with those open loop ones my leader  runs up the shaft 1/2 of the time and its a waste of a cast .  SO now that you have a good collection of lures ,,  whats your rod collection like?"

I did not have the money this winter to get a 3rd rod so i turned to this restocking process getting line,lures,soft plastics,hooks etc....Right now im trying to maxamize what i got and that is 2 rods(yup never did get that baitcaster) I have a 6'6 Izumi Signature series medium action spinning rod, and with that i have a 4000 Shimano Sedona and some 12lb Trilene XL. My second rod is a  7' BPS Mega Tournament Series medium heavy spinning combo, this combo has 20lb braid on it and from time to time i will be using fluoro leaders while fishing clear water.  I think these two rods work out nicely but i don't like using spinnerbaits and buzzbaits on these rods(just does not feel right) So my plan still is to get a 7' M/H baitcast combo, but for that to happen i need to find a PT job.  Shhh don't tell everyone i only have 2 rods"
285561,OhioFisherman,2008-12-30 14:07:00,6623,"Mike, I wandered around in the dark fishing ponds during the week days because the were the closest bodies of water to my home until I hit the mid 30`s and moved close to Lake Erie.  A back pack is the way to go, tackle in the backpack 2 rod in one hand and one hand free. Works in the day time too. Most back packs will hold a few plano boxes, 3600-3700 series, should be all you need to hold your tackle for a trip. Throw in a pair of needle nosed pliers, flashlight, clippers, a pocket knife.  Fishing from shore for bass? Plastic worms, plastic lizards you can riq texas style, I carried a mix 4-8 inch, purple, black and junebug, those colors seemed to be the best producers any where.  A couple of buzzbaits, white, black, and if you want mix in a chartruse one. 1/8 and 1/4 ounce, ones that I use have a twisted eye, and I can`t remember who made them, but more compact than most and sort of a spoon shaped head that glided over weeds and lilies easily.  A couple, few? top water baits, zara spook, heddon torpedo, jitterbug? Your choice try and get ones that make a different sound- action coming across the water.  Jig and pig, whether you fish them in the traditional style or swim them thru cover they work.  Most of the ponds here are bowls, you usually have to get a decent cast from shore to hit deeper water 6-10 feet, might be different in your area though. Shallow or medium running crankbaits, I used Manns -1 Bandit 100 and 200 series white, chrome and black, silver and black, mix in a green or bluegill color.  Rapala floaters were a twitch bait for me, cast let sit a while and twitch, seen bass just seem to float up behind them and strike on the twitch.  Flukes are another good surface bait, rigged weedless you don`t have much trouble working them thru cover.  Johnson Silver minnow with a pork frog trailer, old school but works. Keep it on the surface a little flutter in the pockets.  Blakemore road runners, just a funny styled jig, but they also work, I used a grub trailer on them and later made my own, 1/8- 1/4 ounce.  The soft plastic lures are pretty versatile, I have often used an unweighted lizard with a 3/0 or 4/0 hook as a surface bait, just let it settle slowly down as it hit open pockets in weeds. You can do the same with a tube or worm.  Some of the places I fished were a pretty good hike off the road-railroad tracks, a backpack made it a lot easier."
285673,profisher25,2008-12-30 18:10:00,185,"I must say, you have a great selection of different lures!!!   I also like the topwater frog and the swimbaits! .. but man... you definately need more x raps   :lol:"

285685,Raf,2008-12-30 18:27:00,3495,"keep it simple young grasshoppa.  dem der fancy minnow baits are nice & all but, for bass fishing, many will argue your best friends are the tube for smallies and the jig & pig for largemouth.   #3 mepps black fury has also been known to catch all kinds of fish.  you've got lots of poppers, try out a different style of surface bait (ie. jitterbug).  as mentioned, spinnerbaits are another great lure.. unfortunately many manufacturers went to ""R-Bend"" (not closed loop) style SBs in bass sizes.  If you can find some that are closed loop, get 'em.  By far more durable.  invest in a good rod & reel.  a 4000 series reel on a medium action rod is waaay too much reel for bass.  a 2000 or 2500 series will be more than adequate.  ohh yes, less talk more fish.  get them lures scratched up."
285712,charlesn,2008-12-30 19:17:00,551," Raf has the crux of it.  But I disagree somewhat on the closed loop, I find the closed loop only good for attached a wire leader, otherwise I find the R-bend better.  Less durable for sure, but I think they transmit vibration better and more importantly, I've broken off some very nice fish when the line got stuck in the closed loop area during a hookset.  It's hard to explain how it happens, but it is a combination of the cast and the angle the fish takes the bait from.  It is an infrequent occurrence, but it happened to me in a tournament on a 5 lber I saw take the bait and once on a pike that had a waist bigger than mine!  Charles"
285721,Raf,2008-12-30 19:29:00,3495," that's an interesting take charles, didn't consider folks tieing directly.  99.9% of the time, i've a wire or fluoro leader attached via a snap & the r-bends don't stand up to even small pike."
285732,charlesn,2008-12-30 20:10:00,551,"Totally understandable Raf considering the toothy species you target...  You won't find many bass guys that do not tie direct.  Not sure if it is just being hypersensitive or not as I'm sure bass are dumb enough to eat it regardless of the hardware used to attach the bait, but just in case...  Charles"
285771,Jigger,2008-12-30 21:56:00,1237,"A simple trick for transforming open eye spinnerbaits to ""closed eye"" is to use electrical shrink tube on the bend. Also my #1 for securing trailer hooks."
286049,singingdog,2008-12-31 12:04:00,1047,"You have plenty of hard baits for targetting bass. If I were going to add anything to that collection of hard baits, it would be some shallow-running cranks: bombers, Rap DT4s....something to bang cover with.  One thing to think about if you are primarily shore fishing is castability. I would add a couple of casting spoons - little Cleos are my faves, but lots of them work - to your arsenal. They cover water as well as a spinner bait, and you can throw them farther than just about any lure around. If you are fishing weeds, trade out the treble for an offset worm hook and T-rig a worm, grub or fluke: presto! a weedless spoon that will reach fish farther away than just about any lure you can throw.  You can significantly increase the castability of those buzz-baits by removing the skirt and rigging a grub, plastic frog, or fluke onto the hook."
286057,Dnthmn,2008-12-31 12:43:00,128," Jigger already said it but I have to agree, R-Bends are no problem. Go to your local electrical/electronics supply store and buy some shrink wrap tubing. Cut a small piece and fit it onto the wire at the bend, heat it with a a hair dryer or heat gun and your casts will no longer be fouled by your connection moving on the wire of the bait.  Someone else mentioned tubes as well. In brown and smoke coulours filled with a round head jig they work wonders on water that contain goby's. These are one of my ""go to"" baits for bass on Lake Erie.  Lastly if you are going to fish worm style plastics don't forget about employing the carolina rig, especially in weed beds. Just shorten the leader if casting from shore.  Good luck and tight lines.  Dan"
