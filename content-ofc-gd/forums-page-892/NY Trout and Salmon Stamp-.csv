309817,web-fisherman,2009-02-23 10:31:00,54,Just wanted to see what you guys think about the new proposed $10.00 Salmon and Trout Stamp Governor Patterson wants to budget in? I know this is in the states but I have met many Canadian fisherman on the Niagara River who this will effect. Thoughts?
309820,smokin joe,2009-02-23 11:22:00,226,As long as it wasn't for a cash grab and for a good cause.  I wouldn't have a problem with it if the monies collected were put back into the Salmon/Trout stocking program.  NYS does a lot towards the stocking of these species.
309829,jwl,2009-02-23 12:35:00,1056,"I gotta agree with Smokin Joe here, the U.S. stocks alot of fish annually, and on top of that, they maintain thier boat launches and also access to some fishing areas as well"
309835,bigugli,2009-02-23 12:50:00,6138,"If I recall correctly, some 240 years back you yanks got all upset about a stamp tax. tarred and feathered tax collectors, dumped tea into Boston harbour, etc...   Ironic, eh?"

Bought a Muskie stamp even though I had no intention of keeping one or fishing for them, just to cover accidental kills. Fished in Ontario, New York, PA, and home waters of Ohio, 4 licenses with whatever else I needed (stamps) to be legal. Usually only kept a fish or two a year to eat.  Pay to play? I don`t mind if I am in the game. From what little I have seen of New York waters compared to Ohio? I would rather fish there than here. Seems like they try to do a good job with the fishery and access and nothing is cheap any more."
