310186,Big Cliff,2009-02-24 12:07:00,6899,"I think the one big advantage we would have now is the technology. Electricity for example; it wouldn't take me very long to build a wind powered generator just from parts I have laying around. Would it be enough to run the whole house? No but it would be enough to run some basic equipment.  Food; well there again, the things we have learned about preserving foods would go a long way toward making sure that we would have all the basics available, supplies wouldn't just vanish over night. I probably have enough food in this house to survive for three or more months without adding anything. True, I might run out of a few of the luxery items; Balderson cheese, fresh milk......  I am perhaps one of the lucky ones, I spent a good part of my younger life living up North, fishing, hunting, traping. I know how to make vinegar from birch sap, maple suryp from sugar maples, wine from berries and fruit, and where to look for colt's foot (for salt) and honey. I also have a very transferable trade, there will alwways be someone needing things fixed and I do have a very high mechanical aptitude. There isn't much I can't fix or make if I have to.  To think that we would all of a sudden be transported back to the days of the pioneers and forced to survive with our hands, wits, and a couple of basic tools doesn't make much sense but if you enjoy dreaming about what you could/would do then why not."

As stated earlier, I am not so healthy any more. If  you rely on wood alone here it would be 16 face cords and 2 for cooking. = 6 bush cords. If you fall behind you freeze. You need to be cutting 2 years ahead of use to ensure the wood is dry enough. In other words you are cutting all the time. Because I am not well,  I am behind and running short. The son has not understood the importance of staying ahead of the need. Now we are scrounging to get through to spring. Thank God for the back up heat. By the way, wood heat is not free. It costs $250 per year to upkeep the saw and gas for cutting and hauling. It is cheap, but it can be hazardous. You will only make one mistake. Odds are it will be the last.

309877,Zubris21,2009-02-23 15:30:00,563,"Having grown up in the city I must admit I lack practice in many of the skills needed to create a little homestead and survive in the bush.  This is however a bit if a dream for me.  As long as I can remember I've been heading on hikes, observing wildlife, fishing, and since i was old enough to head out on my own I've been back country camping.  I know its no substitute for experience, but I've read countless books on survival and living off the land, it certainly is no cake walk, and you need to be prepared.   I feel as though I could make do.  It would take a lot of effort and hard work, but as long as you prioritize, improvise and make wise decisions you should have a decent shot at it (provided you have a little bush sense)  As for the survivorman vs bear grylis vs Ray Mears....   I agree that Ray Mears is great, but I also think Les Stroud is as well.  Bear's show is a joke.  He certainly has the skills and has the accomplishments to prove it, but his show demonstrates way too many high risk tasks when in survival situations. (plus go to youtube and search for bear grylis is a fraud and you will see).  as for survivorman, I always kinda wondered about his lack of food as well, but after having recently read his book I understand.  He firmly believes that many people place way too much importance on food during the first portions of survival.  He knows he can survive for several weeks without food, so he simply does not make it a priority since he knows he will only be there for a week.  granted he knows he needs some energy for building/travelling, but in general finding food is lower on his priority list than non-experts might think it should be.  Also if you can find it watch the film Alone in the Wilderness.  story about a fellow who built a cabin and lived off the land in alaska for the better part of 30 years.  Only decided to leave when the winters were too hard on his 82 year old body.  Incredible craftmanship in his cabin."
309968,bigugli,2009-02-23 20:00:00,6138,"I doubt that things will deteriorate to chaos.  However, the history of the homesteaders still has great lessons for everyday people in tougher times. Those skill sets can still be valuable. So is the mind set. As someone else wisely pointed out. Survival is about meeting real need and putting aside, or ignoring, the less important wants and desires. Few farmers, here, hire local folks to work for them. They bring in Latinos and West Indians instead. They are paid less, subsidized and fewer strings attached;  and locals today are unwilling to work for farm wages."

If it gets really bad, the cities will not be fun places to be, but neither will the bush.  There just ain't that much bush meat left to go around.

Both were experienced and educated. They had travelled by canoe  on long treks as Voyagers. The guy literally threw a dart at a map and that is where they were dropped off. I remember the guy saying that as soon as the float plane left and he took a look around and felt that they were in trouble. There was none of the plants around like cattails that he planned eat. The black flies desended like demons.  The two of them basically lived on blueberries for a month. When they were picked up at the end of the month they had each lost over 20 lbs. The doctor said that by the end of the summer they would have been dead.

Of course, in the right areas one can go sugaring off in late winter (there's another set of skills few still posess. I still own a small evaporator.), or over time one can set up hives. It is needed for canning, pickling, the production of bread, fermentation, etc....  I agree about the shovel. 100 years ago child mortality was around 10% and pushed to 30% or more during epidemics. Go into some of the back country areas in Ontario and seek out old settlement graves. See one family plot with 7 or more tombstones put up over the course of three years.

I would stay there every summer growing up with him learning to hunt and fish, shovel cow crap, milk the cows, chop wood, bail hay and anything needed fixing around the house. He would tell me stories of stealing coal from the railroad tracks to keep warm.  He died about 5 years ago and was the biggest influence in my life today, not a day goes by I don't think about him.

Think of this as a period of self-correction and an opportunity to reevaluate what is important and time to work toward towards it..."
309410,cram,2009-02-22 04:49:00,1733,"I respect Les Stroud but the guy sucks at finding food.  How often does he completely misfire trying to catch fish or game (and end up with nothing)?   Instead of setting up his elaborate traps or fishing contraptions, lift a rock and find/eat a crayfish....i mean, its never as complex or dangerous as he portrays it to be."
309411,oxcowboy,2009-02-22 04:49:00,544,"the thought doesnt scare me much at all, i own a 200 acre farm full of livestock and tillable ground, there is a major creek within easy walking distance that has bass, crappie and catfish, plus there are plenty of whitetail deer around.   we also have 3 ground wells for a water supply.  so my only real worry is wasting my ammo on theives that come to take what i have.  i would love to get on the t.v show survivor and have thought alot about doing it, just got to get the boys a little bigger so they can help their momma a bit more around the house.  if and when i make it, i will be the one thats looking for a club while the rest of the contestants are marveling over the beauty of some bird or monkey.  mmmmmm drumsticks and monkey fritters. hell i will probably gain weight while im there. lol  as my favorite hank williams jr song says ""I can skin a buck and run a trot line-a country boy can survive!  jason"
309412,cram,2009-02-22 04:52:00,1733,"there will always be an economy.  As long as people are willing to trade services or products for other services or products, there will be an economy.  Especially in canada."
309424,richyb,2009-02-22 06:17:00,774,The girlfriend better start eating wild game because ive got venison in the freezer that only cost a broadhead ( the arrow is still fine)  haha.
309431,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-22 07:37:00,10439,"HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, let's see. I would have to survive on Moose, Caribou, Buffalo, Ptarmigan, Lake Trout, White Fish And Burbot. Be pretty tough but I could probably manage. Would need to stock up on staples like sugar, flour, etc as well as gas for the boat, generator and sled, shells and some extra arrows and broadheads. But I don't have to worry about any of that, my job is safe."

309447,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-22 12:51:00,2585," your clearly not in the auto industry or rely on it for your well being.  Im not being a smart ass here but anybody who has job security/retirement pention or lots of money thinks like you.  Half the county right now questions weather they will be employed at the end of the year.  If your one of them then your not spending.  I am lucky i have job security with large % increases in my business but my neighbours are not as fortunate. It all depends on what side of the coin your looking at.  its different for everybody out there right now.  In regards to this tread, if it came down to it my family would survive!  you have no other choice  cheers!"
309449,Big Cliff,2009-02-22 13:04:00,6899,"There is a wonderful book out called ""Back to Basicsome very good friends gave me a copy many years ago and I in turn gave my son one several years ago. It is filled with information on traditional skills, everything from building a shelter to trapping, fishing, and preserving. Back to basics  There is enough information in this book to give you a really good chance of surviving in the bush if you had to."
309458,Greencoachdog,2009-02-22 14:17:00,8163, Sounds like a great place for a survival commune!!!  Ok y'all!... we meet at OCs just before the next holocaust!!!  Be there or be Square!!!
309461,Sinker,2009-02-22 14:24:00,8692,"I've always dreamed of just packing up our stuff, and heading into the woods to stay. Nothing would suit me better. I was brought up old school, from a family of survivors. My fathers family HAD to live off the land to survive, so its been passed onto me. If I had my choice, I'd go back to the old way of doing things.  I was watching an episode of Little house on the Prairie the other day with my wife, and even said to her how great it would be to live like that!  Sinker"
309464,Bernie,2009-02-22 14:30:00,3190," The first staple you should get is salt, lots of it. Sugar isn't a necessity. Preserving food is your first concern as there would be long periods of no kill. If animals were being hunted consistently they sure wouldn't hang around as they sometimes do now. Also your body needs salt, just not near as much as we get now.  Vitamens through a long hard winter. Don't see too many oranges growing here. So what do you eat to suppliment that? Boil up some pine needles-yuck!  O ya and how are you going to boil them? People that lived here for thousands of years had a hard time surviving. And some think they could do it? How many here actually spent a night in a tent in the winter? It's not pleasant even on a mild winter night with proper gear (not to me anyway). So you have all this gear. how are you going to carry it all? Where are you going to keep it so the animals don't take it away. How many of you have ever stalked an animal? They see and hear you a a lot sooner than you can see or hear them. If it ever gets that bad (it wont) make sure you bring a shovel too. You will spend a lot of time burying the dead come spring."
309467,Greencoachdog,2009-02-22 14:43:00,8163," The Buzzards have to eat, just like the worms do!"
309468,solopaddler,2009-02-22 14:52:00,8605,I've done it before so I'm sure I could do it again.
309473,Greencoachdog,2009-02-22 15:01:00,8163," The large game would be a luxury, you would have to survive mainly on smaller game... rabbits, raccoons, possums, armadillos, coyotes, wild dogs and cats,ducks, geese, small birds, chipmunks and rat's BBQed on a stick!"
309486,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-22 15:25:00,260, I don't know why he makes things so hard for himself like starting a fire  I am very comfortable in the outdoors given my military survival training years back.  For me however no one compares to Ray Mears.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Mears  You may have seen him on OLN... a great man.
309501,lew,2009-02-22 15:38:00,12766," I'm with you on that one Jeff, it's an excellent show and I think I've seen every episode, and my favorite  was where they hand made the birchbark canoe."
309502,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-22 15:43:00,260," My favorite as well.  He has filmed a lot in Canada.  See the ""hobo fishing"""
309310,Fishnwire,2009-02-22 01:10:00,983,"If the economy totally collapsed and you didn't have a job, and totally lost your current way of life...had to provide a way of just basically staying alive...stay warm and not starve to death; How many of you could live ""off the grid"" so to speak?  For example, I have a camp way in the northern Ontario bush I currently use for recreational purposes. I could go there if I lost my home in the city. The stove is wood fueled and the small building well insulated. I wouldn't freeze to death over the winter, but might have a hard time feeding my family during those months. Nonetheless, I think I could eek out some kind of existence up there, for the most part, independent of the outside world.  As things appear to get worse and worse every day, I think about this more and more. I don't really think it will get that bad, but I am thinking.  Has anyone else considered a similar type of ""exit strategy""?"
309317,bigugli,2009-02-22 01:28:00,6138,"Learn to make do or don't survive, but even a bush rat needs $ to make a go of it. Fuel, seed, shot and shells still cost dollars."
309319,OhioFisherman,2009-02-22 01:29:00,6623,"I live in the country, 4+ acres of land, easily enough for a large garden, raise a pig or few, chickens, maybe a cow. LOL of course it would be on the wife and kids to do the work. City folks have fewer options because of lack of land.  Have a wood burner, and get wood from Amish sawmills. Not real sure what to make of the economy here, just can`t see a turn around with the job loss rate. A job and one you can live on are two different things."

309325,danbouck,2009-02-22 01:34:00,4380,I know I could find a way to survive with my family. I'm not worried enough to actually have a plan in place and Squirrel meat isn't that bad
309326,Greencoachdog,2009-02-22 01:35:00,8163,I can live off of Catfish and collard greens if I have to...  got enough guns and ammo I could take what I need if it came down to it.
309334,ozaibak1,2009-02-22 01:40:00,401,"That's actually a situation I've been pondering over the last few months, what if I had to change my lifestyle because of a drastic change in conditions? I would gradually like to learn to 'live off the land,' being a city person I have a lot to learn, but am anxious to learn it. Pondering a hunting license, don't have any buddies that hunt tho, it's tough enough finding ones that like to fish down here."

309343,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-22 01:50:00,260,If you got skills you will survive.  I am not worried  I picked a career that people cannot do without my services.  Can pick up my tools and move on to different things at the drop of a hat if need be.  I can see bartering services becoming a huge thing in the next year.  Will work for bass boat time
309355,2 tone z71,2009-02-22 02:21:00,1311,yeah most of us would be alright
309356,tschirk,2009-02-22 02:27:00,261,"Two guys were hiking through the bush when they spotted a bear. One of the guys reached into his pack and pulled out a pair of Nikes. His friend looked at him.  ""Do you really think those shoes are going to make you run faster than that bear?""  ""I don't have to run faster than that bear. I just have to run faster than you.""  There will always be an economy. I believe in continually developing your marketable skills/education so you can ""run faster than the other guy""."
309359,GeorgeJ,2009-02-22 02:32:00,207,I'm eligible to retire in 3 years or if I loose my job before that which is likely my house goes for sale same day and when it sells I'm heading for a simplier way of life in the north. Cost of living will be way way less not to mention fish and game readily available for the kitchen table.
309360,Mattones,2009-02-22 02:32:00,587,Id be looting  haha Kidding. I have no idea what I would do.

309377,nautifish,2009-02-22 03:08:00,1416,Les stroud is the one Bill.......I think its a great progam......  But why is the other guy putting himself in stupid situations?    After all its about survival right?
309378,bigugli,2009-02-22 03:09:00,6138,"There are a lot of forgotten skills that need to be relearnt, and fewer people left who can pass them on. Many don't want to listen and learn. We quickly forget that survival is based on self- reliance. It never hurts to keep a veggie patch, learn food preserving. Reduce the unnecessary extras we like to surround ourselves with. Berry picking and digging up roots are just as important as fishing and hunting."
309381,nautifish,2009-02-22 03:12:00,1416,And to be perfectly honest i think i would be more worried about trying to survive  after this    Mushrooms     if this ever happened. not the economy going for crap.
309383,lookinforwalleye,2009-02-22 03:24:00,4399," You know the big problem here is spending you guys listen to and read to much media doom and gloom and all of a sudden a economic slowdown turns into a recession. Sort of a self fulfilling proposition. Good for Lew for putting some money into the economy by buying a new boat, in the last 2 months I have bought a new house,about 20K of new stuff to put inside,gone on vacation and I will be buying a new car next week. If you guys keep thinking about living in the woods you just may end up there.  Support the economy and buy something."

So was 'gasoline alley'  All we could ever do was kiss our keesters goodbye if it had happened. So why worry?"
309388,OhioFisherman,2009-02-22 03:36:00,6623,"Part of the problem with the economy is people bought more than they could afford, with no thought for the future, eg. job loss, illness. Here in the states the savings rate is lower than most developed countries.  Spending and debt are a good recipe for disaster. Nothing wrong with buying but you have to be smart about it. Don`t consume just for the sake of consuming, all you do is make other people rich."
309393,nautifish,2009-02-22 03:43:00,1416,\ I went out and bought myself a lurvly new pair of shoes today.....Does that count?  Ok just kiddin i diden't really......
