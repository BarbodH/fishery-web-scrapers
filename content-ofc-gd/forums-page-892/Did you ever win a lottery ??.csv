Seriously I usualy get nuttin...  Mom on the other hand... Super lucky over the years 5K on a banco ticket in 90's, couple grand here and there at the casinos But her luck hasn't alway been so good.... The classic antismoking pitch. Had a set 6 numbers she used to play on the 649 most weeks....as the story goes, she had enough change in the purse for the ticket or the smokes, but not both. Lets just say she will never quit smoking as she calls it her million dollar habbit. (before the days of Debit) True story."

But I did happen to win the Go West with WFN and Starchoice contest to go to Vancouver Island fishing.  A guy here locally a few years back won a little over $9 mil just after he was told he would never be able to continue working in his specific field and that he would need neck surgery."

Funny an old college friend she keeps in touch with actually heard Debbe's name and called her at work to tell her to call the radio station.  Had a free weekend in Orillia with the cash, trying to make it GROW at Rama. Had no luck with that....but it was a free weekend."

309814,CLofchik,2009-02-23 07:53:00,854,"Lotteries are a tax on the stupid.  Sorry, but it's true. Okay, try this.  Stand on top of the CN Tower, beneath you there's 6 MILLION Timmies cups.  One of them is painted blue.  Drop a nickel in the blue one.  Pay an appointed (anointed?) swivel servant $3/pop for the privilege.     Carry on."
309823,pikehunter,2009-02-23 11:58:00,1659,"Most ever won was $150 and a bit more, can't remember the exact amount. Won that the first time I bought a super seven ticket. Ever since then only free ticket here and there or 5 or ten bucks. I always get the encore, insurance of perhaps winning at least a free ticket. Can't win if you don't have a ticket! So I generally only buy 1 a draw for the 649 and super 7. I don't feel that the more tickets you have the better odds you have, just like playing the slots, the longer you play a machine your odds are not increased, it's a proven fact.  My father won $1000 in $10 tickets at a local radio station years ago, guess what he won? . . . . Nothing, he wished they had just given him the grand!  I just hope to win the encore, a million is enough to make me happy   A friends parents won 100,000 on the encore just before they made it more numbers and increased the prize to a million. Another guy I knew, John, his father won big, John doesn't have to work at his old job anymore.  My brothers wife won the Irish Sweepstakes a long time ago when over $100,000 meant something and you could buy a new luxury home for less then $70,000.  It is possible to win. As for being a tax on the stupid I don't buy that idea. It is the hope of a possible win that keeps us buying. I don't think any of us ""stupid"" people think we have a hope in hell of hitting it big but it just adds a little something to dream about in our mundane lives.  Nine bucks a week (for me) to play the lotteries is not such a big deal after all I don't smoke anymore and rarely have a beer or a drink, alcohol is a tax on the stupid for sure, think about it! I would easily spend that much a day on beer alone if I were still the drinker I once was or a smoker."

309537,OhioFisherman,2009-02-22 17:01:00,6623,"Depends on your view, 5 years of playing in a pool at work 3, 4, 5, times of hitting 80-90 bucks, enough to cover the next weeks entry money for the people involved.  5 years of chasing my wife off and on until she trapped me, still a big winner there. Managed to work long enough to get my retirement before I got too sick to work, so that was like a jackpot.  Better to be happy than rich? At least content? Now if I could hit the health lottery, a few years in a boat to make up for lost time?"

309569,jace,2009-02-22 17:55:00,472, that's a pretty good win.   I recently heard about a bit of a problem with a work group ticket on a US lottery.  i think it was about 15 people who won a lottery over $200M and they were trying to cut out 4 people from the win because they weren't there the day that particular ticket was bought but they are normally part of it.   I think the 4 left out were taking legal action on the grounds that some of the small winnings from previous tickets carried over to buy the new tickets.    I wonder how that turned out.
309582,pike slayer,2009-02-22 18:22:00,1177,my buddys mom won some like 5-6mill about 15years ago. she was actually smart with her money and probably has more now then what she won through canadian savings bonds and such. they have a nice big house with a swimming pool inside and 3 brand new cars in the drive living comfortly. her hushand quit his day job and drove a handicap bus for years for something to do and to help others until he had a heart attack and died in his bus last fall. they are some great ppl and i dont see how others that win blow it all and fast.
