309494,Guest gbfisher,2009-02-22 15:33:00,0,  We're not supposed to eat Musky? DAMMMM .  ......gotta cancel my Kawartha trips for next season......
309498,RsX,2009-02-22 15:36:00,48,i don't see the problem if these fish are farmed fish only if there farmed fish everyone has there opinion on eating fish and what kind of fish. and everyone has there opinion on C&R
309519,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-22 16:26:00,3761,It bugs me because I fish mostly for bass. For example if i were to see walleye or trout or musky being sold at a grocery store i would not be as annoyed but some anglers that target those species may shake there head and be a little upset. If its legal than it must be ok to do. Being said what would you say if you saw a dozen Musky or Pike being sold at a grocery store and you were a angler that spends his/hers days fishing for these fish.
309528,nancur373,2009-02-22 16:42:00,1211,I'f they are farmed then they are raised for human consumption and they weren't taken from our waters. We would not have had a chance to catch any of those fish anyway. No matter what species.  Curt
309538,Beans,2009-02-22 17:05:00,3339," I doubt you would see musky in the tanks as they take too long to grow to eatable size but then again if they are well fed...who knows???...someone mentioned seeing pike...were the pike alive?  This is nothing new...Fifteen years ago or more, I saw like bass in tanks in Chinese supermarkets in Richmond Hill..."
309545,Victor,2009-02-22 17:14:00,1609,"the largemouth is very common is asian supermarkets (they call them green bass) and I believe that's legal since I've seen them there all the time, and in every supermarket.  However I have not seen a smallie in one of those tanks ever (yes, I do go and stare at the tank, especially when cabin fever really hits lol). I do find THAT a bit strange."
309598,shane,2009-02-22 19:14:00,652,"Next time I go to the grocery store, I'm taking my 'K-Tel Pocket Fisherman'.   I have some new prototype jigs that need testing."
309607,StylinCatch,2009-02-22 19:30:00,43,oops
309609,StylinCatch,2009-02-22 19:32:00,43,"If cabin fever sets in that bad, bring a scooby doo rod next time with your favorite bait , just to see what they would say haha. Cheers"
309760,waterwolf,2009-02-23 02:02:00,556,surprised we haven't seen crappy at grocery stores .
309777,uglyfish,2009-02-23 02:36:00,981,"  no, the pike was not live. they were pike steaks. it was fortinos, and i only seen them once, someone mentioned american eel, i did one time see they had a tank with american eel for sale, very small ones though, wanted to buy one for my fish tank lol."
309779,bigugli,2009-02-23 02:45:00,6138,Sobey's often carries frozen pike filets in the freezer section.
309784,uglyfish,2009-02-23 03:00:00,981,im not allowed to eat pike... my gf thinks theyre pretty lol
309857,Bernie66,2009-02-23 14:03:00,123,"They do sell crappies in the Chinese markets.  That's how you know they are running heavy in Rice and Simcoe and they sell for $8.99 a pound, $10.99 for the live ones."
309861,BillM,2009-02-23 14:19:00,17367,I feel worse for the fish in the Bass Pro fish tank...
309862,rhare,2009-02-23 14:22:00,387,seems like people are over reacting a bit.  I know bass are extremely rare and slow growing so I could see why people would instantly get the wrong idea...............   They farm raise most species of fish nowdays so nothing you see should surprise you.
310003,ciceri,2009-02-23 21:05:00,535," No kidding, they're so lively in that tank eh.  I've gone into a No frills around there, probably the same one, and there was some freaky stuff for sale in those tanks, like eels"
310034,fishdawg,2009-02-23 23:04:00,912,"fish are fish... geez no probelm at all as long as its all legal which it appears to be largies arent my preffered table species, but then again neither are muskie, but ive eaten them both legally...."
310050,Beans,2009-02-23 23:25:00,3339," And that precisely is why my bro-in-law stopped giving them away...  I can hear them now after he C&R'd a big slab...  ""Hey mister...you no throw back...you give me""...  ""Naw...too small...too small""...  He could be a nasty bugger at times..."
308945,PatrickGG,2009-02-21 02:33:00,562,"I shop at No Frills located at Lansdowne and Dundas ""Formly used to be Knob Hill Farms Back in the day"" and was shocked for i never seen Bass being sold at a Supermarket, My question is this?? Is this not Illegal since Bass season is closed? I am stumped i never seen this before i seen filleted Walleye for sale at Loblaws but never have i seen Largemouth and Smallies.. Here are some pics i took with a cell phone:  Largemouth hiding in the corner of the tank, and a Smallie just underneath the carp fin:   Dead Largemouth:   Smallies in the herd of fish in the back center of the pic: "
308963,ozaibak1,2009-02-21 02:51:00,401,"To my understanding that would be illegal anytime of the year, as I believe it is illegal to sell any gamefish commercially in Ontario, that's what a fishmonger told me when I asked if they sell lake trout..."
308984,Cudz,2009-02-21 03:35:00,2652,Commercial netter on Georgian Bay regularly sell walleye to the public.  Pretty sure they are Native Canadian netters.  I think they are allowed.
308990,aniceguy,2009-02-21 03:47:00,1094,illegal walleye have commercial catch status bass are by catch...ilegal call the local OMNR office and let them investigate
308997,Greencoachdog,2009-02-21 04:02:00,8163,Their   -es would be under the jail in Alabanana!!!
309000,purekgw,2009-02-21 04:08:00,585,thats so not right
309010,steverowbotham,2009-02-21 04:24:00,1800,
309012,John Bacon,2009-02-21 04:26:00,3277,"Probably farm raised fish.  Assuming that the supplier is properly licenced, it is perfectly legal.  Were the fish all of similar size?  If so, that would indicate that they are farm raised fish.  There are commercial fisheries operating on Lake Erie and Georgian Bay.  There are also fish farms in Ontario.  It is perfectly legal for game fish harvested by licensed commercial fishermen or farm raised fish to be sold in Ontario."
309014,uglyfish,2009-02-21 04:28:00,981,"ive seen walleye and pike at fortonos. only once did u see the pike there, but walleye is always there... however, 12.99 per lb is too rich for me when i can catch it for free. but never in my life have i seen bass, what were they in the tank with?? may have been mistakenly put in there, but either way call the MNR and let them know and show them the pictures."
309018,PatrickGG,2009-02-21 04:30:00,562,"I'd say they would be between the 2 and 3 pound range, Just curious? how would you explain the transportation once out of the supermarket of a out of season fish, it baffles me i just got a gut feeling it's wrong."
309020,bigugli,2009-02-21 04:35:00,6138,"Game fish have been commercially sold in the past. Pike from Manitoba is the most obvious. It wasn't taken in provincial waters and you have a receipt.  Seeing as the LM was in a tank of live hybrid stripers or white bass, it is probable they are farm raised and not product of ontario waters..  I do recall 20 years back a fishmonger in Kensington getting pinched for selling bass"
309022,misfish,2009-02-21 04:40:00,29133,"Next summer, Im going to do like they do down east. Catch me some fish.bring it to the docks, and sell them off.  , , , , ,, I just,s gots, to buy me a boat."
309027,smbhunter,2009-02-21 05:01:00,186,"As long as the supermarket has all of the proper paperwork, it is legal. I would still call the MNR to be sure though."
309091,joonmoon,2009-02-21 13:36:00,528,"Bad very bad....... Call the tip line and squeel on em, shut em down before more people start and all of a sudden theres not more bass to be caught....GIT EM."
309094,ehg,2009-02-21 13:41:00,2666,"Sometimes i go to the same store Patrick and always felt there was something 'fishy' going on there. They did change the fish department distributor a bit ago, not for the better. I will never buy fish there and never have.  Seems like less carp in the tank there these days."
309140,ehg,2009-02-21 16:22:00,2666,"Decided to check this out myself since this store is a 5 minute drive and a few groceries were needed.    The largies were advertised as 'Green Bass' at 8.99 lb. There was thousands of people already there and vrobably more to go, must be farmed fish or from U.S. My gut feeling was it was somehow legal."
309141,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-21 16:24:00,3761,Seeing that bugs the crap out me. I have no clue if it's illegal but in my opinion it's wrong to be selling them in a grocery store.
309146,bassjnkie,2009-02-21 16:35:00,1101,"Legal. The fish in that tank are farm raised, just like the trout and bass ponds. I can get a 12"" bass for $6 farm raised any time of the year. Transportation is the easy part, you always get receipts at No Frills."
309149,Bernie66,2009-02-21 16:39:00,123,"Those bass are most likely from a fish farm.  They hardly ever vary in size, always between 1-2lbs. You see them in almost every Chinese supermarkets and restaurants in the GTA.   If you don't believe me, go check it out yourself.  I asked a guy at the counter once and he told me they were all from some fish farm down in the states.  If you think about it, where would they get so many bass in the middle of winter and all in the same size slot???"
309151,Toronto_Angler,2009-02-21 17:01:00,698,  Why is it ok to eat any other fish but not bass?  They aren't exactly an endangered species.
309463,aniceguy,2009-02-22 14:28:00,1094,"an apology, after I asked an mnr freind he did in fact answer that  its legal as long as the approprite commercial invoice is avaliable, he mentioned its unreal whats in some of these tanks right down to americian eel"
309478,Jer,2009-02-22 15:14:00,1426,"  Why does it bug you so much? Doesn't seem any different to me than selling any other type of 'live' fish. As long as everything is on the up and up and the fish are sourced legally, I don't see the problem. A fish is a fish is a fish...  Obviously many people eat bass, why should those who for various reasons can't get out and catch their own be denied."
309481,nancur373,2009-02-22 15:19:00,1211,You bass thumpers need to relax. I'd hate to see the turmoil if someone started to sell farmed musky.
309487,bigugli,2009-02-22 15:25:00,6138,"Farmed fish are no different than farmed ""wild game"", or beef, pork and poultry for that matter. They are raised for human consumption."
309489,hammercarp,2009-02-22 15:27:00,964," SACRILEDGE !  Seriously though, you are right. Nobody goes ballistic when they sell walleye, trout, char or any other fish."
