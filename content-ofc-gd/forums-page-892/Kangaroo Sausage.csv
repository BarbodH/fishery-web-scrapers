Got looking in the freezers and came across kangaroo sausage. They had regular and some with jalapeno. I bought a pack of the regular ones. Threw them on the BBQ last night. I guess I should have asked the butcher how to cook them cause I dried them out a little. But none the less they were awesome. Will get more in the future that's for sure.   Curt

309551,Roy,2009-02-22 17:21:00,13728,"Roo meat is very lean. You have to do it in bacon fat or somesuch and add sauce of your choice. But, once you do that, you lose the taste of the roo. It's just one of those meats."
309568,POLLIWOGG,2009-02-22 17:55:00,835,"If you lived in the US at the beginning of the fast food boom you've eaten rooo. The US used to import all kinds of it, suspicion was it was finding its way into fast food burgers,  don't know if they still do."

309604,Jigger,2009-02-22 19:23:00,1237,"A friend of mine back in the day took a trip to OZ and brought back this bag with him. Another one of my friends asked him what the deal was with it, friend #1 says "" The locals believe that if you lick the pouch, it'll bring you real good luck"" So he licked it. We laughed our guts out when he was told that it was a kangaroo... Ahh the good old days."
309633,nancur373,2009-02-22 20:33:00,1211,Next time I'm there I'll ask him how to cook it. They seem very knowing of the meats there
309639,smokin joe,2009-02-22 20:47:00,226,"I'd say you probably need to prepare it similiar to Venison, not sure though"
309833,Gerritt,2009-02-23 12:48:00,6129,I have had Roo jerky and found it delicious! Gator Jerky was good too!  G
309849,cambo,2009-02-23 13:25:00,62,"Nooo,Skippy. never tried but would like to, so far caribou is my favorite followed by goose"
309854,Greencoachdog,2009-02-23 13:47:00,8163," I would suggest a parboil and then slap it on a very hot grill for no more that 2 min per side, 4 min total!  Cooking with animal fat is not good, with bacon fat being the worst!!!"
309976,nancur373,2009-02-23 20:23:00,1211,would have to agree Glen
310000,walleyejigger,2009-02-23 20:56:00,876,"eating roo eh? did it  have any ""kick"" lol  never tried it, nor seen it available   mmmmmmmmm.....bacon fat  everyday my grandfather used to eat 4 toast for breakfast, he would spread a thick layer of bacon fat on them (like it were peanut butter) then cover with molasses, could feel my arteries cloging just watchin him, he lived to be 86, he was a miner for 30 years aswell a farmer most of his life and was strong as an ox,"
310054,nancur373,2009-02-23 23:32:00,1211,They had roo sausage with jalapeno. That would have some kick.
