I can now join the 21st century.  By the end of the week, I should have my start-up package, self-explanatory from there she tells me.  I signed up for the 2 Mb/s package at $29.95/month (no contract). Are these speeds realistic? Right now, I'm lucky to get a connection at 44 kb/s so any improvement will be significant I imagine."
309869,douG,2009-02-23 14:51:00,2693,"I get about 1.7 MB/s with Sympatico.  Cable is faster at times, but I have no complaints.  You will be tickled pink with a connection that's 50 times faster than your dial up."
309875,Beans,2009-02-23 15:14:00,3339,About time Bell finally came through...I got tired of waiting (5 years)   and went with my cable company a year or so ago...  Enjoy the faster speed...
310064,Jer,2009-02-24 00:01:00,1426,"Cable has never been an option here.  Nexicom wireless teased me a couple years back, but my signal wasn't strong enough. My neighbour across the road, up the hill a bit, apparently just got set up with them.  This call from Bell really came outta nowhere."
310070,nancur373,2009-02-24 00:12:00,1211,I am with acanac right now. If DSL is available you can get them. Not sure of the MB speed but it's fast. You have to pay for a year upfront. 18.95 plus tax per month for unlimited download.  Curt
310077,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-24 00:31:00,10439,"Dude, don't do it!!!! Stay with gial up!!!! Since I got high speed I haven't left the house!!!!!! All I do is download Porn all day!!!! So please for your own sake don't do it!!!!!"
310185,Jer,2009-02-24 12:06:00,1426,I figgered I might get out more...cause I could get my porn so much faster...
310258,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-24 16:04:00,10439,"  NAH, you just get more!!!"
310300,Governator,2009-02-24 17:40:00,879,I got Rogers which is a 7MB line.  I get speeds of over 800K/s when downloading from the big servers like microsoft.  I also just got a letter from Rogers saying their prices are increasing and my package will be $46.99/month.
310306,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-24 17:58:00,2050,"XPlornet Sattelite ""high speed"" here baby...I get a whopping 600 to 800 kb/s connection, and when I download or upload to much (usually once or twice a day) they crank me down to 28k for an hour to ""make it fair for other users"".... and for all of this excellent service, I only pay $100.00 a month!   :wallbash:  Can't get Bell High Speed, or Cable.  The Rogers ""speed stick"" only get's a connection 8 KM down the road, but not at my house. I'm living in an internet dead zone...good thing I need it for work on a daily basis! Had I known it would be this bad I wouldn't have purchased the house.  Anyways, congrats, I'm very jealous.  cheers, UF"
