309830,ChrisK,2009-02-23 12:36:00,2772,Ive been Turkey hunting for a number of years but with no success...Also hunt deer with a group and we do well always ending up with venison in the freezer every season. Good to see your picture posting skills are coming along...
309837,Greencoachdog,2009-02-23 12:53:00,8163,"If you'll join photobucket, it will make posting multiple pics much easier than a direct upload from your computer. Photobucket resizes them for you when you upload to their site so you don't have to worry about all the resizing riggamaroll.  You can join here: http://photobucket.com/"

Will also get my black bear tag just in case of an aggressive encounter and may put in for grizzly for the same reason, but less likely.  Great tom there, would love to hunt those if/when I move back to that area."
