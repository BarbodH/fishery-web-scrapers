309335,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-22 01:41:00,260,Got some late day ice time at a new location for me.  Been wanting to try this spot for a while and it finally worked out for me today as I managed to hook up with some people I know through work.  Good overcast and -4C made for a comfy couple of hours.  Plenty of ice at this lake which shall remain nameless   to the tune of 22 inches.        Some of the folks there had struggled to ice five crappie since 7am.  I started at 3:30pm and within 10 minutes on my first hole I iced my first fish for the season.    This would be the only fish for me and no one else caught anything the rest of the day.  Hoping I can get back to this spot soon
309339,Garry2Rs,2009-02-22 01:45:00,1425,Maybe Jack's is fished out...
309344,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-22 01:52:00,260, Been slow there for some time apparently.  Closes next weekend at that location.  MNR was out today doing a survey/study...confirmed things have been small and slow
309428,richyb,2009-02-22 06:35:00,774,"""Hoping I can get back to this spot soon ""  I think i would be picking a different spot if i only caught 1 perch."
309441,Greencoachdog,2009-02-22 11:17:00,8163,Nice report and pics Jeff!  Can you not sweet talk Ad. out of any of her jigs?
309480,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-22 15:19:00,260," Yup, what I should have said was a different spot on this lake"
309482,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-22 15:20:00,260, Haven't you heard that story yet?
309485,Greencoachdog,2009-02-22 15:22:00,8163, Not yet...
309492,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-22 15:30:00,260, They is too pretty  She was so impressed with your packing job she doesn't want to mess with it  Let me at it I say
309505,Greencoachdog,2009-02-22 15:49:00,8163,"LMAO!!!  Go ahead and mess them up Ad., it's ok!"
309780,Beans,2009-02-23 02:47:00,3339, Hey Jeff...I recognize those holes in the foreground...did Big Cliff give you the gps coordinates ???  ...It looks like you were standing in the same spot I was when I took this picture two weeks earlier...    Note the tall tree on the top right background...
309785,Sinker,2009-02-23 03:02:00,8692,Ha.......now your stealing spots to get fish??  Nice guy  Pretty neat with the two pictures though!  There must have been quite a few fish around if you got one eh??  Congrats on killing that skunk.........its all downhill from here!  Sinker
309826,Big Cliff,2009-02-23 12:17:00,6899,"Glad to see you got out there and got one anyway. That can be a strange lake to fish, lots of suspended fish and if you don't have the equipment to spot them it can be really hit and miss."
309839,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-23 13:00:00,260, HAHA totally not intentional  I have been told for the last month to walk out and try this spot.  Some people I know through work have been hitting this spot every weekend for the past month and doing well.  I show up and its a slow day  I was not given any tips from any OFC members as to gps location
309843,Big Cliff,2009-02-23 13:17:00,6899,"Well Jeff, all you had to do was ask LOL, I would have shared with you! As a mater of fact I am hoping to hit there tomorrow for the afternoon bite if you are interested! You'd be more than welcome!"
309847,maybe,2009-02-23 13:24:00,307,"That must be one special chunk of lake, if both Beans' crew and Jeff's work buddies use it.  Glen, you're not going to see Jeff ice fishing with my Super Special Autographed Edition GCD Jigs.  They're still in their way-too-cute shipping container, and aren't coming out til I hit the boat.  Jeff tends to lose/break tackle - if I don't try something out before I let him at it, I might never get to try it!"
