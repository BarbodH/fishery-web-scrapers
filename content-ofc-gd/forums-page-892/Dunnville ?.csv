308371,Big Cliff,2009-02-19 23:02:00,6899,Just wondering if water levels have returned to normal and is ice forming up solid at all. I am thinking of heading down there next Wed. to see if I can hook some smelts.
308374,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-19 23:14:00,2582,Wondering the same thing Cliff. I was really itching for a feed of smelt before last weeks rain messed things up.
308384,purekgw,2009-02-19 23:28:00,585,the water has gone down near normal in caledonia so should be about same there the ice i dunno tho
308389,bigugli,2009-02-19 23:38:00,6138,Seeing as the ice totally washed out on the Grand it might be a little while before it is good again. There are other spots for smelt though.
308394,sonny,2009-02-19 23:43:00,511,"contact fishmaster,,,the marina still might be good to fish"
308400,drwxr,2009-02-19 23:57:00,453,where?? im interested in that aswell.
308576,Big Cliff,2009-02-20 09:17:00,6899,"I have never ice fished smelts, what is the typical setup/bait/ is it like perch fishing, they come in schools, lots of action then nothing, do you usually have to move around? So many questions?"
308621,pikehunter,2009-02-20 13:19:00,1659, As quoted from Steve's website.  When you heading down this way Cliff?
308631,Big Cliff,2009-02-20 13:35:00,6899,"Well, I am hoping to get out somewhere on Wed.. Not sure yet where it will be yet or if I will be able to go at all. Depends on the weather and work."
309669,Jason B,2009-02-22 22:36:00,15,"The marina has 12 inches, reported from fishmaster on his site."
309681,Big Cliff,2009-02-22 23:17:00,6899,"OK, well, 12"" of ice is good even for a guy my size but are the smelts hitting? It is a 6-7 hour drive for me and I would sure hate to do that and get skunked!"
309726,bigugli,2009-02-23 00:53:00,6138,Just a little teaser Cliff.  Tonight's supper  
309733,Big Cliff,2009-02-23 01:06:00,6899,"OK, now that I have cleaned the drool out of my keyboard..... What are the ice conditions like there?"
309738,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-23 01:11:00,2582,  If you posted them smelts WITH some of your homemade bread...I think I would have had to come and hunt you down and blow up your computer  Man I would love a feed of them!!! I'm hoping for a road trip to get into a few. Just gotta get word that they are biting.
309742,bigugli,2009-02-23 01:19:00,6138, I'm gonna get the son to run down tomorrow to check the ice and let you know. Smelts will be there all winter.
309827,Spiel,2009-02-23 12:17:00,9065, Would it not be easier to just buy a bag full of smelt at the local grocery store on your way home from some local fishing trip.
309828,Big Cliff,2009-02-23 12:27:00,6899,"Not this old man LOL! Only ever did that once when I had ""promissed"" a special young lady a fish fry for dinner that evening and when I got to my secret trout hole someone had blown the beaver dam and drained the creek."
310040,Sinker,2009-02-23 23:12:00,8692, Geeze......wheres the fun in that?  Can't beat FRESH smelts!!!  Sinker
310081,Fishmaster,2009-02-24 00:41:00,920,"Ice is good very good in the Marina and the smelt are still here ...Marina Ice 14 to 16"""
