309127,John Bacon,2009-02-21 15:30:00,3277,"This reminds me of a time that I was at client for a GST audit.  (I work for a company that performs accounting services for clients).  As soon as the GST auditor left the sales manager called us over to his office.  He had some Facebook pictures of the GST auditor.  I only saw one of them; it looks like it was taken downtown somewhere, he was wearing a speedo.  Appearantly some of the pictures were more revealing; I didn't see those... that is not where my interests lie.  It still makes for a good laugh at the office."
309134,johnnyb,2009-02-21 15:56:00,3413,"I haven't spent too much time checking into every little detail, but, Facebook retracted their policy that the article was talking about.  That being said, facebook isn't about privacy...for me it's about keeping up with friends and family, and posting photos.  And playing mini-golf and bowling at work."
309135,Greencoachdog,2009-02-21 16:02:00,8163,"Here's a more satiracal write up on it... kinda like johnnyb's reply.  Everybody loves to complain about Facebook. But I've been wading through all the nonstop commentary over the last few weeks and I've made a startling discovery. Everybody also lies about why they use Facebook. After exhaustive research, here are the Seven Lies You Tell Yourself About Facebook.  1. I Only Friend People I Really Know: Stop pretending you have standards; you will friend anyone. You would accept Bernie Madoff if he asked. You want your friend count to be sky-high. That's why I accept all sorts of people I haven't seen in 20 years and couldn't pick out of a line-up. I refuse  to have one less friend than my arch nemesis from college. I will not tolerate a lower count than my annoying colleague who sucks her teeth in meetings whenever I say anything. Admit it, you're no better than I am—how many of your ""friends"" would you invite to your house?  2. Facebook Made Me Do It: Facebook didn't make you tell all 1,384 of your friends that you once had chlamydia. Facebook didn't hold your hand onto the mouse and force you to type: ""Josh is in favor of slapping geese and women,"" as one of your ""25 random things"" and it certainly didn't waterboard you into asking everyone what their slave name is. Psychiatrists call this ""externalizing blame."" It's a way to lay-off shame and self-loathing onto somebody (or something) else so you can feel better about yourself. I once wrote, ""Raina is feeling like the cat's meow,"" and hated Facebook for days because of it. I know now that it was nobody else's fault but my own.  3. Wall-to-Wall Flirting Isn't Cheating: Just because it's called ""social networking"" with ""friends"" doesn't make hard-core online flirting OK. Do not try and tell me that you were surprised when your boyfriend left you after he read your pornographic wall-to-wall with his cousin. Also: stop sending your assistant cute virtual gifts. Virtual gifting counts. In fact, it's probably not appropriate for you to be ""friending"" her or the cute summer intern in the first place. Same thing goes for wall-to-wall stalking the love of your 7th grade life. Online harassment is just as bad as the bricks and mortar kind.  4. I Use Facebook to Keep in Touch With People: No, the truth is you're nosy. Admit it. You scour the profiles of other people for the same reason I do. You want to know their business. Facebook isn't addictive—your desire to know what other people are up to is addictive. The over-sharing thrills you. I know I'm hooked. Don't you hunt through your friends' walls looking for any scrap of information that will produce that warm tingly schadenfreude feeling?  Facebook is our own personal reality show and our friends are the stars. What else besides ""American Idol"" or ""Project Runway"" allows you to be so judgmental while wearing pajamas? If people stopped revealing ridiculous stuff about themselves in their status updates, ""Rock of Love"" would be your ""guilty pleasure"" instead. You know you're dying to discover your college roommate lives in a trailer in his mom's backyard. I literally cried from joy when I saw that an ex-boyfriend was sporting a comb-over.  5. I'm Soooo Over Facebook: Come on. You love Facebook for exactly the reasons you pretend to hate it ... it's the Big Thing. And we're not falling for that ironic distancing pose you've been adopting lately. We know you spend hours looking for former girlfriends or that guy who you loved from freshman psych but didn't have the courage to talk to. I tried to act all Margaret Meadish when I first joined Facebook (""It's a classic example of mass hysteria inspired by our collective need to be famous. Blah, blah, blah."") But everybody knew I wasn't on there doing social anthropology. I was on there because I wanted to snicker at that girl I went to elementary school with who reports every single one of the eight pomegranate martinis she drinks every night.  6. And I am Soooo Not Competitive: We don't just want more friends than everybody else; we also want the highest score in Word Twist and the most virtual Easter Eggs. I recently spent nearly 24 hours playing Scramble on Facebook until I had a higher score than my friend Dough Dough. Why? Because I knew Facebook would send him a note that said; ""Raina has beaten your personal high score on Scramble."" When he commented on his complete and total defeat, I just said; ""I didn't know Facebook would tell you that. OMG! LOL!"" We love Facebook because it allows you to gloat to your heart's content and hide that self-satisfied smirk on your face behind the wall of the Internet. By the way, if you have a Scramble score higher than 147, don't even think about friending me.  7. Facebook is My Friend: No, it's a business (albeit one that has yet to make money). Everyone knows casinos hide the exits and pump oxygen into the air to keep you gambling and get all your money. Facebook is doing the same thing but with avatars and Food Flings. They want to trap you behind their dotcom walls so they can attract advertisers. Think about it. If Facebook really loved you, they wouldn't run those ""5 Friends HATE you!"" banners on the top of Scramble. And have you ever had a friend try to take ownership of all the posts and baby pictures you sent them for who knows what reason? Nor has a ""friend"" ever taunted me with ads that implied Obama owed me $12,000 in personal-stimulus money.  © 2009"

309175,Muskieman,2009-02-21 18:55:00,2472,"  Yes, there is   I will not post a link to it but...  there are 179 members so far  and 175 photos."

309201,Joey,2009-02-21 19:59:00,9122,It's called Ontariofishing.net.  I joined because Nita (Sis) asked me to and I saw that Jef (TeamEmptyPockets) was on there.  I've found lots of high school chums and caught back up with them.  I did quit for awhile because the invite to join Applications was driving me nuts.  I recently opened my account again and so far so good.  I don't use it on a daily basis like some tho.  Joey
309209,Bernie,2009-02-21 20:37:00,3190,Recently a group of people from my hometown have been posting pictures from the past and present. It has proven to be highly interesting as there are people from past and present posting them. It's like a hometown reunion. It's grown close to 500 people now. In a small town many of the people I grew up with had to move away to find employment. It's great to hear from them again and what they are doing now. It's not a doom and gloom place at all.
309606,cellwood,2009-02-22 19:28:00,11,Just a question but what makes anyone think that their information is any safer on this board than on Facebook?

308665,bigugli,2009-02-20 14:37:00,6138,Yup. A prospective employer has only to google search your name and  thumb through facebook to get all the dirt on you that you've plastered on the internet.
308666,theRJ,2009-02-20 14:40:00,55,I use it as a communication tool since thats the only way I can get in touch with some of my friends. (Yes it is sad) Reading this doesn't surprise me and its the reason keep it professional when I m on it. The worst that you can find of me is a picture of me consuming a be ver age.
308667,Marko,2009-02-20 14:41:00,854,"Thats why you dont post crap on it. You don't call in sick and then go fishing next day and post pics on there for you boss to find haha. Its great for people who have friends in different cities and countries, great way to stay in touch. Just have to use it properly"
308681,BITEME,2009-02-20 15:18:00,1968,facebook = EVIL  its not just what you post but the people posting you can get a pretty detailed picture from that  I dont do face book hate it i have enough problems on fishbook

308684,Beans,2009-02-20 15:35:00,3339,Thanks for posting this Dawg...  A couple of years ago one member of the family thought Facebook would be a good way for the bunch of us to keep in touch as some are scattered far and wide...  The only way to sign-in back then was via our group but something changed about six months ago and now I'm receiving requests via e-mail from peoples all over the globe ???  Luckily I used a nom de plume for my username so googling my real name doesn't do much...
308687,snag,2009-02-20 15:38:00,1932,  Well that did it for me

308705,ccmtcanada,2009-02-20 16:15:00,7971,"I'm a facebook user, but unless I'm being overly naive here, no one can look at my profile page or pictures unless I've accepted them as a friend first.  Now, if you didn't set up any of the security settings, then yes, anyone can look...and that's just your own doing.  I have mine set that only friends I've already accepted can view anything...it's a snap to set up."
308706,capt bruce,2009-02-20 16:18:00,820,And its allso a SNAP to defeat .. beware
308709,Bernie,2009-02-20 16:25:00,3190,I like it. I have nothing to hide-or fear. Lots of laughs and fun to keep in contact with others.
308710,trapshooter,2009-02-20 16:28:00,1234,  Exactly.
308711,ccmtcanada,2009-02-20 16:33:00,7971," Yep, it would be relatively easy for a hacker to defeat...but the example they give in the article is a potential employer.  I suppose some may employ hackers to spy on their own or prospective employees, but I doubt it....  Bottom line is, if you have stuff you never want people to find out about, don't put it on the internet.  Any social networking done online, including this forum is hackable."
308712,BassAsin,2009-02-20 16:34:00,806,its an easy way to share fishing pictures with plenty of people!
308717,kickingfrog,2009-02-20 16:44:00,8333,"While I have nothing to hide and do use facebook, I am glad facebook and digital everything was not available when I was younger.  Nothing like having every foolish youthful indiscretion posted for the world to see."
308718,tbayboy,2009-02-20 16:51:00,1497,I'm with you on that KickingFrog - I have young cousins that put WAY to many things up there.  I just don't lead an interesting enough life to have embarrassing things come back to haunt me anymore thank God.
308723,Bernie,2009-02-20 17:02:00,3190, It's hilarious to read too! Glad I wasn't the only one things like that happened to.

I somehow got the impression that it was nothing more than a cyber ho house. Maybe it was Misty4u269 and Ivana Humpalot's profiles urging me to join that gave me that impression... or it could've been something else...  I can see how it would be a very interesting place for single people or married people looking to swing... but that's not for me.  I know, a Redneck with morales is an oxymoron... but I've been called worse things!"

308834,nautifish,2009-02-20 21:13:00,1416,I  am on face book i like it for the fact i can stay in touch easily with all my family and freinds back in Europe. I don't use my real name on face book or even my messenger.  Its not only face book where people can find out things about you which is why i never use my real name on any sites i use on the computer.  Like cliff said people can only veiw your profile if you add them as a freind.
308864,jace,2009-02-20 22:21:00,472,"  In the pre-www era, the same thing only it was due to usenet posts.   Famous people posted in usenet during their college/university days then, low and behold, dirty secrets from their distant past would come back to haunt them.  ...tidbits of info people found by running searches on archived usenet servers.   Although you can get messages deleted from a particular server where YOU woudln't see it anymore, other server in its newsfeed do not have to honor delete requests and continue to propagate the original.  Every usenet message is effectively permanent and spread worldwide once you put it up.  The bad part about posting anything these days is not only is the info on the originating server, even if it's permanently deleted there, it still sould have been found by web spiders and stored indefinitely in caches by search engines.   I have a pretty bad example of this..A friend of mine at a university put a class list with grades on his web server that had no direct link to the file.   One of his students who was searching his name one day came across that file with the entire class list and their grades.   Not only did the spider find the class file (google's in this case), it also read the PDF and cached and categorized all the info on its own (google's) servers.   After being notified of this, my friend removed the file from his own server but it was too late, it didn't matter because google searches could still display the document by pulling out its own cached copy.   Nice...  history will repeat itself.   The moral is, of course, do not put any info online that you wouldn't be willing say on the jumbo screen at the superbowl."
308868,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-20 22:52:00,3761,Facebook Rules!  There are a lot of good groups on there and it's a great communication tool.
