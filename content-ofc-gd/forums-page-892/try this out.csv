309477,paulyboy83,2009-02-22 15:13:00,54,what the heck.....can't figure out how to get left cupboard open!  What's with the darn origami cormorant????
309497,gdelongchamp,2009-02-22 15:34:00,199,I'll let my 16 yr old son tackle this. He's the comp geek in this house now.
309560,Tinman,2009-02-22 17:41:00,376,  got the link to it? i am about to lose my marbles!
309592,caper,2009-02-22 18:56:00,210,  I know what you mean...I gave it a good go before I cheated but I just needed to know...  Here you go..  http://gamesuy.blogspot.com/2008/06/switch-walkthrough.html
309602,Jigger,2009-02-22 19:17:00,1237,"That ones not too bad. The other rooms are real mind-benders, though. The one you linked to is the only one I've been able to solve yet. Cool time waster!"
309955,blaque,2009-02-23 19:20:00,2419,"this is insanity, i found the cheat and still cant get past the button sequence. I flip the grid to show the fish, bear, wolf, swan sequence, and it says to hit those buttons in order, but cant find the button in the swan reflecting on the wall?????????"
309958,bigredfisher,2009-02-23 19:22:00,300,I DID IT YEA
309962,rbaquial,2009-02-23 19:47:00,968, HINT: Look @ the 'TAIL'...
310010,blaque,2009-02-23 21:21:00,2419,"hint? , just gimme the straight scoop man, theres no shame in my game at this point  LOL"
310038,walleyejigger,2009-02-23 23:07:00,876,"blaque,  i had the same problem as you, i bet i clicked in and around and all over that damn reflection over 200 times, but it eventually peeled back some wallpaper a little above and to the left of the swan, keep tryin...."
309117,FISHINGNUT,2009-02-21 14:57:00,253,"This should keep you busy till open water season.   Similar one last year I think but the room has changed ,Visit My Website"
309129,blakewalk,2009-02-21 15:45:00,86,"Woah thats tricky, took about half an hour!"
309205,SlowPoke,2009-02-21 20:17:00,2984,Half an hour?!?! I just used the stick to smash the window.
309216,johnnyb,2009-02-21 21:03:00,3413,"I found the stick, but can't use it!  this is fun..."
309220,Lunker777,2009-02-21 21:17:00,866,AHHHHH this game is pissing me off hahah ! How the heck do you do it ?
309224,FISHINGNUT,2009-02-21 21:39:00,253,???? I cant figure it out either   I figured I would pass it on and maybe as a collective effort we might be able to escape
309226,SlowPoke,2009-02-21 21:41:00,2984,"pssst, don't waste your triangle."
309232,JPD,2009-02-21 22:09:00,296,Tie the sticks together with the string and open the hatch on the ceiling...
309233,Lunker777,2009-02-21 22:16:00,866, hahah sticks and strings ? Where are they ? are there other buttons to use other the clicking the mouse ?
309240,SlowPoke,2009-02-21 22:30:00,2984,Yes! The one on the desk and the one by the train track.
309243,Beats,2009-02-21 22:42:00,543,"I did it and it took me forever.  I think the biggest setback was the java programming (or whatever it is)  Even after reading the tip about tying the 2 sticks together, it took me a minute or so of different attempts to get the things to connect.  After that it was pretty straightforward."
309253,mikegta,2009-02-21 23:16:00,39,"one stick is under the couch, the other one is behind the cabinet when you click on the garbage can.......string you have to cut off the train(shape thing) then you gotta hit the box on the roof with the sticks"
309255,mikegta,2009-02-21 23:17:00,39,i cant figure out this grid thing tho
309259,drwxr,2009-02-21 23:23:00,453,open left cabinet and press buttons to get the same combination on the window and then insert a coin. the key from room door will be hanging from the ceiling.
309261,mikegta,2009-02-21 23:32:00,39,no wonder i put the coin in first lol
309263,mikegta,2009-02-21 23:39:00,39,"did it  thanks for the tip, i could of been there all night trying to get that grid thing"
309280,rbaquial,2009-02-22 00:22:00,968,I'm assuming there's a specific order that needs to be done?!
309295,rbaquial,2009-02-22 00:53:00,968,How the heck do you open the LEFT SIDE CABINET?! Arghhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
309306,danbouck,2009-02-22 01:04:00,4380,I spent 2 minutes on it and got mad. Now I refuse to try again!
309327,pigeonfisher,2009-02-22 01:35:00,696,"I got some origami thing lit up...see the pattern fish, bear, dog..."
309347,camillj,2009-02-22 01:57:00,1988,wow .. theres a half hour of my life I ll never get back
309349,rbaquial,2009-02-22 02:09:00,968,Oh man.... FINALLY got it!!
309375,wallyboss,2009-02-22 03:04:00,1095,1/2 hour   i'm up to 45 min. and I am stumped.  I am not missing much I think but once you build the origami thing do you do something with it??
309386,rbaquial,2009-02-22 03:33:00,968,"Yeah, it goes ""somewhere"" (the origami) ... almost like how you put the ""blocks"" on top of that wooden train. It took me almost 45min-1hr to figure it out - as soon as I was done with it, I went out for a smoke - thats how much it annoyed me!"
309414,caper,2009-02-22 05:25:00,210,I couldn't figure that out for the life of me...I had to go and find the walkthrough...
