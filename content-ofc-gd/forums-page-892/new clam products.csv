I have the older scout as well and the thing is in better condition than my new one with the swivel seat and pole. Anyone else notice the new products are cheaply built now???? Also was thinking of spraying the inside with rhino bed liner or something to fill in the holes, has anyone tried this before????"

I beat the crap out of that hut.  last year I bought a voyager and it had the new black coating inside. Just the wear from the poles moving seemed to remove it. I called calm and complained. they told me the coating coming off would not compromise the canvas. I explained that it let light in which effected my fishing at times and for the price of the huts it should be better quality. They had no problem sending me a new hut skin.  I bought a scout this year and the same thing is happening, my older scout is better. Im kind of disappointed but I still love the huts."
