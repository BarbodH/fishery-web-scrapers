309992,Sherriff,2009-02-23 20:47:00,252,Curious if anyone has tried the shaft extension kits for their motor.  Extending it from a short to a long shaft.  There are kits out there but not sure of the prices yet.  Might be best to sell my short shaft instead and buy a long shaft but then I am into a used motor that I do not know much about.....  Thanks for any info...  Sherriff
309998,Roy,2009-02-23 20:52:00,13728,"If you have the time, I'd try to find the best deal on a long shaft and sell the short privately."
310027,Fisherman,2009-02-23 22:30:00,7201,"A bit of mechanical work involved, drive shaft needs to be replaced, shifter rod replaced, water pipe replaced and outer case replaced, like Roy said, probably better to either trade or sell and buy another.  It may just be plain difficult if it's already a few years old."
310032,sonny,2009-02-23 22:49:00,511,Actually an easy conversion and will hold up just as well!
310042,Bernie,2009-02-23 23:14:00,3190,"First question is ""what kind of engine is it?"" before I would say ""it's easy"". It also may not be cheap. Some motors used an extension housing while others you need a complete case assembly. Sometimes you can locate a used assembly too."
310043,2 tone z71,2009-02-23 23:16:00,1311,"20-30 hp conversions are 3-400 from the stealership,well worth it you get the longer driveshaft ,shiftshaft and 5 inch exhaust housing extension all bolts up ,if ya can upgrade to the 20 inch by all means do so"
310046,Bernie,2009-02-23 23:23:00,3190,"North East Shark,  I would appreciate you not referring to dealerships as ""stealerships"". Our shop certainly isn't one and it isn't appropriate here."
310057,2 tone z71,2009-02-23 23:35:00,1311,"never once mentioned your buisness Bernie ,think of it as freedom of speech bro"
310062,BUSTER,2009-02-23 23:57:00,1336,"id have to agree open public forum free to say what he wants i too refer to dealerships as stealerships and canadian tire as crappy tire and burger king as burger barf  etc,etc,etc some get insulted, some agree."
310072,steve barrett,2009-02-24 00:23:00,142,
310092,POLLIWOGG,2009-02-24 01:06:00,835,What are you trying to do with it?  I get away with running a short shaft kicker by trimming it in all the way.  I answered an add for a long shaft Yamaha and when I got there it was a short shaft but it was in such nice shape I thought I'd try it.
310093,sandybay,2009-02-24 01:07:00,64,Yes you are much better to sell your motor and just buy a long shaft model as the parts and the work to convert to a long shaft is just not worth it.
310100,boatman,2009-02-24 01:41:00,350,"Some motors are easier to extend than others. Personally, I'd get the extension kit. You never know what you are going to get in a used motor. If you buy the kit I'll help you install it. No charge of course.  Bernie, nice boat. Love the Johnson's."
310104,kickingfrog,2009-02-24 01:54:00,8333,"  No we are not free to say what we want. Them's the rules, top right of of the page. If we don't like it we can take a flying leap. If I were to refer to someone as a ____ it would be edited before I even posted it. I do my best (most times) to stay within the rules because I like this ""place""."
310113,Bernie,2009-02-24 02:32:00,3190, Thanks Boatman. I really like them too. That was my dads boat in 1959 or 60. We are the oldest Johnson dealer in Canada. It was a really sad day for us when OMC bit the dust. It was almost like family. Time still goes on.
310120,BUSTER,2009-02-24 02:43:00,1336,"he's as free to say the word stealership as you are to post your opinion. is that better wording? i didnt say ""free to say what he wants"".."
310122,Bernie,2009-02-24 02:49:00,3190,Forget about it guys......Sorry I mentioned it. It was just a kind request is all.
310180,pikehunter,2009-02-24 11:27:00,1659,Why do you have the need to change to  a long shaft motor? Have you been running a short on a tall transom up until now or do you just think a longer shaft is better?
310199,Sherriff,2009-02-24 13:16:00,252,"Thanks for the info guys.  Sorry I did forget to add some additional info about the motor.  It is a 2005 9.9 Mercury short shaft, 4 stroke to be used as a kicker.  I find that on my transom, it does come in and out of the water a little the few times I tried it.  Nothing to affect the steady impellor stream of water coming out.  I just think that the 20"" shaft would be  much better for steering control and a better bite in the water if it was a little choppy...  As mentioned, I hate thinking about buying an unknown used motor.  I do have a kicker bracket that would fix the situation but I also prefer to mount it right on my transom and I don;t want to drill more holes in my boat...LOL  Thanks  Sherriff"
310215,pikehunter,2009-02-24 14:13:00,1659,That explains the need it doesn't it?  I guess comparison price shopping your options will help to dictate your decision.
310218,paul_614,2009-02-24 14:18:00,168,I see sailboats where the motor is mounted up high and pivots into the water. There might be something like that for powerboats.
310277,POLLIWOGG,2009-02-24 16:43:00,835,"My boat is flared out at the back like a built in wave waker so I have to add a few inches onto an outboard bracket to be able to lift the motor. with the motor way back from the hull I can get the prop out of the water when its rough. I found if I trim the motor all the way forward with the prop thrust pointing down into the water it helps a lot. Give it a try, I think it would solve your problem at no cost."
