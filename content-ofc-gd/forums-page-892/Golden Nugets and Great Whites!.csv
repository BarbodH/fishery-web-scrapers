309436,Greencoachdog,2009-02-22 10:46:00,8163,Great report and fish Kevin!!!  I think the photographer is jealous of your fish and wants to put as little of them in the pic as he can!

309590,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-22 18:50:00,2038,"Before heading out I topped up my bird feeders..     Seems this little guy wanted the whole feeder to himself...     On the way up to the second Lake i spotted a Bald Eagle flying overhead...by the time i pulled over and got the camera out it was too far away for a good pic  ...  :wallbash:.....    Now at the lake I looked over at the shoreline and spotted what looked to be Snow donuts, Got a little closer and yep that's what they were  :worthy:          :whistling:"
