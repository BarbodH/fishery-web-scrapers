309928,Jet,2009-02-23 17:47:00,364,"I'm thinking about going down this weekend, near the bridge on Hwy 49. Can you tell me what the ice conditions are like?  Thanks!"
309946,Hawg Hunter,2009-02-23 18:49:00,204,"  please don't go near that bridge or the belleville bridge,i know for sure the belleville bridge is NOT SAFE open water and thin ice all around it,as for hwy 49 im hearing NOT SAFE as well.  real high current in these areas.........  play safe  Hawg Hunter"
309948,Hawg Hunter,2009-02-23 18:55:00,204," you MUST be on the ice at 6:30 set up and fishing(atleast where iam fishing)cause as soon as 7:30-8 am rolls around they shut down.  now if its over cast they will bite all day     just like they did on sunday,the lads i had out iced 4 real nice eyes between 12pm and 1:30pm,when i got back out with the other lads at 2:30 set up and fishing by 3 they were hitting as soon as we dropped a line down.............,they hit right up until dark  taker easy and stay away from the high current areas......  Hawg Hunter"
