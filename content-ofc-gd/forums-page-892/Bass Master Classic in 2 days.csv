309747,bucktail,2009-02-23 01:33:00,1857,looks like I missed by 1 spot with Skeet Resse edging out my pick of Mike Iconelli. Guess I should have played the fanatasy draft!
309773,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-23 02:28:00,3761,"It was close, all day the updates were saying that Mike was doing great and he did, Skeet just had a good enough day 2 plus his day 3 bag to get the win. If i'm corrrect it's his first classic victory."
309774,Cudz,2009-02-23 02:31:00,2652,Great down to the wire finish.  I like both Skeet and Mike. Mike is a nut and Skeet is always there too.  Mike has already won one classic and this is indeed Skeet's first.  Good tourney.
309775,uglyfish,2009-02-23 02:32:00,981,"kelly jordan started out good today, but just didnt get the big bites he needed, however, my pick was gary klein and well, he didnt come close lol."
309797,profisher25,2009-02-23 03:38:00,185,"congrats to Skeet!  ... now , how many days till Bassmaster Classic 2010?"
307631,bucktail,2009-02-18 01:16:00,1857,Post your picks for who is going to take the classic this year.  I wont pick KVD cuz thats like picking Tiger Woods at a Major!  I am thinking Mike Iconelli since his classic win was also down in the bayou if I remember right. At least it is a sign of spring!   Darren
307647,PatrickGG,2009-02-18 01:45:00,562,"Imma go with the Lady on this one ACTUALLY the first woman to get into the BMC Kim Bain-Moore, my second pick would be Shaw Grigsby.."

307825,diggyj,2009-02-18 15:32:00,548,"Gary Klein won't win as he has failed in his previous 26 attempts to win a Classic.  KVD goes in 4 year cycles. He won in 2001 and 2005, does that mean 2009?  He is my pick. As a dark horse I will take Greg Hackney.  DIRK......  Here is the lowdown:  This February Kim Bain will join the ranks of Annika Sorenstam and Danica Patrick as a female competing against men on her sport's biggest stage, namely the 2009 Bassmaster Classic. How do you think she will do against the men? I think she has just as good a shot as any of the men. Maybe her lack of experience will be her downfall. Luck will play a part and thus she has a chance.  This years field has 51 entrants of which 13 are Classic Rookies  There are 7 former Classic champs in the field: Jones 2008, VanDam 2001, 2005, Iaconelli 2003, Davis 1995, Duckett 2007, Hite 1999, and Clunn, 1976, 1977, 1984, 1990  There are 9 former Toyota Tundra Bassmaster Anglers of the Year: VanDam 1992, 1996, 1999, 2008, Reese 2007, Iaconelli 2006, Davis 1995, 1998, 2001, Martens 2005, Horton 2000, Klein 1989, 1993, Hite 1997, 2002, and Clunn 1988  Casey Ashley is the youngest at 25  Rick Clunn will be oldest at 62  Clunn will break his own record for most Classics fished with 32 while another BASS great, Gary Klein, can break his own record of Classic futility if he fails to win in 2009. He already holds the record for most appearances without a win at 26  If he can win his 5th title, Clunn will eclipse Woo Daves' record as the oldest Classic champ. Daves was 54 years, 2 months and 28 days old when he won the 2000 title. Florida's Bernie Schultz could also break Daves' record with his first BASS win. He'll be three months older than Daves was when the next Classic ends  No one in the field can break Stanley Mitchell's record as youngest Classic champ. Mitchell was 21 years, 5 months and 19 days old when he won in 1981  Do any of you enter or run fishing pools?  FULL FIELD:  1. Casey Ashley 2. Kim Bain-Moore 3. Ken Baumgardner 4. Michael Burns 5. Brent Chapman 6. Rick Clunn 7. Mark Davis 8. Boyd Duckett 9. Jay Evans 10. Edwin Evers 11. Todd Faircloth 12. Terry Fitzpatrick 13. Jami Fralick 14. Shaw Grigsby 15. Greg Hackney 16. Matt Herren 17.

307829,BigSmallie,2009-02-18 15:46:00,61,Aaron Martens or Tim Horton.
307831,GBW,2009-02-18 15:50:00,8460,I have to pick Dean Rojas as he will be using the new Rojas Fighting Frog.  With the new bait (and the hype I have read about) then he should do well...
307837,charlesn,2009-02-18 16:18:00,551,1. Boyd Duckett - was on em hard in pre-practice 2. Hack - local and all-around awesome stick 3. Edwin Evers - left official practice to attend birth of his first born which is usually a good luck harbinger  But betting against KVD is never a profitable venture.
307853,Garry2Rs,2009-02-18 17:26:00,1425,"Todd Faircloth was neck-in-neck with Kevin VanDam into the last event of the year, and should have won Angler of the Year. He's my pick to win the Classic. Unless the weather changes things. There is rain predicted for today and then a huge cold front for the weekend.  There will be rain and snow to the north, and according to the experts, the Red River could muddy up fast. If conditions change, everything that was learned during the practice in December might go out the window... In that case, in my opinion, the only safe bet is KVD.  He's the thinking man's angler, he won't get frustrated, or have a melt-down.  This is doubly true if he gets an early lead...There will be a huge intimidation factor at work if he does."
307855,dheitzner,2009-02-18 17:28:00,314,I'm saying Kelly Jordan or KVD. Never count out Rick Clunn either...
307857,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-18 17:31:00,0,dont forget to get your fantasy fishing team up on espn.com (it is free)  here is the link http://games.espn.go.com/bass/frontpage   maybe get a OFC group going for bragging rights  or if you want I will create it and give the name so you can join  if you rank in the top worldwide you get cash  last year ron james from fish t.v. won $8000 U.S. cashiers check for finishing in the top ten
307859,diggyj,2009-02-18 17:41:00,548,Dam that is a huge payday without even hitting the water....  Contest isn't open to Canadian residents though......  Dirk....
307864,charlesn,2009-02-18 17:50:00,551,"Ron James won through the FLW fantasy fishing which is open to Canadians.  I won a $10 Walmart gift card, but it's only good in U.S. stores.  The ESPN one is B.A.S.S. the competitor to FLW."
307881,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-18 18:44:00,0,  yeah u are correct I heard it from a shimano rep last year was not sure if it was bassmaster or flw
307882,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-18 18:44:00,0,but seriously  we can make a group and play all summer  it is a tonne of fun
307892,steverowbotham,2009-02-18 19:15:00,1800,"1. Hackney is a local, he'll do well, but he wont win it... the crowds around him will be too big. 2. Scott Rook is a great river fisherman 3. Kelly Jordon is another great river fisherman 4. Rick Clunn ... i know he's on them right now, and he's got a flat bottom aluminum boat to get into the backwaters. 5. Ish Monroe ... same deal as Clunn, I know he's going where others cant, he's a wild man."
307897,capt bruce,2009-02-18 19:38:00,820,"IM with Steve if the water stays low and dirty , Rick Clunn or Monroe. Allways been a dream of mine JUST TO MAKE IT INTO THE CLASSIC, one day ...."
307921,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-18 20:52:00,3761,Skeet Reese or KVD will be my top 2 spots in this classic.
307924,eye-tracker,2009-02-18 20:58:00,89,I will go with Dave Wolak.  -s
307926,Dave Mercer,2009-02-18 21:08:00,148,"Hi Guys, I will be down at the classic doing seminars. My plan is to do daily video blogs from the event so make sure to check out www.factsoffishing.com for updates starting tommorow!  My pick is Kelly Jordon!"
307928,mbac31,2009-02-18 21:13:00,904,Boyd Duckett Mr Hite as a long shot
307949,Minnow,2009-02-18 21:49:00,177,Hey guys just wondering if the Classic will be showing here in Canada and if it is then what channel and what time?  Thanks
307952,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-18 22:15:00,0,it might be on channel  151 on charlie
308078,profisher25,2009-02-19 02:25:00,185,"ok ok OK.... tough decision, but my top choices are either Kelly Jordon, KVD, or Mike Iaconelli."
308204,charlesn,2009-02-19 14:26:00,551,I change my vote.  Steve Kennedy.  Apparently fishing out of a flat bottom aluminum to be able to get in to an area the others cannot reach...  HUGE advantage.
