309166,douG,2009-02-21 18:12:00,2693,"Ya, there really is no mystery at all where that came from or who caught it. How can you forget a name like Ewout Blom?"
309184,trapshooter,2009-02-21 19:25:00,1234,cool link Mepps.  Thanks.
309189,Tinman,2009-02-21 19:35:00,376,"my boss told me this week that this was his friend and caught it up north, i kept my mouth shut, I just nodded and said wow."
309631,Mike the Pike,2009-02-22 20:21:00,3421,Oh no not again  Hey GCD did you notice that nice fish was caught from a TILLER BOAT!!!!!
309632,holdfast,2009-02-22 20:26:00,1813,Havent you Heard? That Pike was caught in Orr Lake near Barrie and Wasaga.  Theres more in there.
309668,Squid,2009-02-22 22:28:00,1656,Man this is really freaking old. Broken record more like it. Wish we could post this freaking picture at the top of the forum with the proper story.
309671,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-22 22:41:00,2038,WOW...  I cannot believe that this pic is still circulating around different fishing sites like this ....  :wallbash:     :dunno:
308994,steelheader42,2009-02-21 03:57:00,44,"This is the new record in Canada. He caught it on Rainy Lake.Check this thing out. The last picture is unbelievable! This guy (in the photos below), was fishing and caught a 36"" Pike.As he was reeling it in, a 56"" pike tried to eat it!!!!! He brought them both in on the same net. Awesome catch on a river in Canada- 55lbs - 56 inches.  I was just wondering how true this is?   "
308995,SBCregal,2009-02-21 04:01:00,688,hah.....again?
308996,4thgen,2009-02-21 04:02:00,157,"Those pictures are of a 40lb pike from Holland, the third is unrelated and of a smaller pike. They've been circulating for a few years now."

309054,Handlebarz,2009-02-21 12:12:00,3790,the only thing I hate about that email is when it comes to a message board and we let the cat out of the bag right away come on guys its the winter I thought we were supposed to drag it on for a few days and get some people really excited about it. Oh well there is always next time for the great debate on where this monster came from I think Joey was close.
309058,Roy,2009-02-21 12:25:00,13728,If you subscribed to Esox Angler you'd know exactly where it was from. (Shameless plug for EA.)
