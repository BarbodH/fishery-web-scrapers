308867,fishnsled,2009-02-20 22:48:00,3520,"Di and I decided if was time for a getaway and have been wanting to try dog sledding for a couple of years now.    We ended up going with Adventure Seeker Tours  Brad, who has over 20 years of sledding experience behind him, was out guide for the day.  Here's a shot of him getting our team ready with Di in the background ready to go.    Some of the other dogs were quite happy to just enjoy the sun and have a nap before we headed out.  Love the lead dog yawning.      Gotta love a face like this one.    Di looking like a pro.    Once the teams were in place and we had our orientation we were off.  I found it quite amazing that once the dogs knew it was time to go they just sprung to life.   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i105.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid105.photobucket.com/albums/m240/Fishnsled/Family%20Weekend%202009/Dog%20Sledding/MVI_5724.flv"">  And a couple clips going down the trails.  It's a totally different experience being a passenger as to the driver.  Me, being ""the pro"" (never done this before) am quite willing to offer instruction during the ride.  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i105.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid105.photobucket.com/albums/m240/Fishnsled/Family%20Weekend%202009/Dog%20Sledding/MVI_5726.flv"">   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i105.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid105.photobucket.com/albums/m240/Fishnsled/Family%20Weekend%202009/Dog%20Sledding/MVI_5728.flv"">   Di glad to be taking a break after an hour or so of mushing.    As were the dogs.      It was my turn on the way back and I soon found out what all the huffing and puffing was about.  Man!!  What a work out.  It was quite funny that if the dogs felt that you were not helping out enough they'd stop and give you the look.  lol!  Di and I were both had a great time.  We had an awesome team of dogs and thanked them at the end of our tour.  Thanks to Brad as well!       From here we went to our B&B for the night.  We stayed just outside of Huntsville at Ink's Spot B&B  Great place to send a couple of days, great food and accomodations. (Thanks for the great hospitality)  It was a pleasant surprise to see the visitors before breakfast on both mornings that we were there.            On the Sunday we ventured into Algonquin Park for some hiking and snowshoeing.  Before we went in we did a side trip to the water falls (can't remember the name of them).  Di and some ice build up on our way back to the falls/   View from the top of the falls    Looking toward them.     Amazing how water moving that fast can have a build up of that much ice.  And a few shots from Algonquin.  From the top of the lookout trail.    This guy (martin) was hanging around the bird feeders at the visitor centre.      Grossbeak.  (At least that is what I was told)    Not sure what this little guy is but nice colours on him.    Well that's pretty much our weekend in a nutshell.  Always nice to try something different and I'd recommend you add dog sledding to your bucket list.  Got that one crossed off mine now."

309921,fishnsled,2009-02-23 17:19:00,3520,"  Thanks for the I.D. help with the birds ehg.  Cliff, there was another outfitter in Algonquin - Outbound I thing they were called.  Anyhow, they allow kids to ride with an adult for $25 I think.  Seem pretty reasonable I thought.  Not sure it the outfitter that we went with would do the same thing or not.  Glad you all enjoy the post, thanks for reading."
