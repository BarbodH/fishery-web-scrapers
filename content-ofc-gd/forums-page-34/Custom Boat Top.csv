1056122,KawarthaAngler,2020-02-06 18:44:00,273,"I had my Lowe Fish'N Ski done by Ron's Canvas in Ennismore, just a short drive from Peterborough.  I know it isn't Barrie, but his business has decades behind it and is known for quality.  I've been very happy with mine.  It's 3yrs old now and still holding up like new.  https://www.ronscanvas.com/"
