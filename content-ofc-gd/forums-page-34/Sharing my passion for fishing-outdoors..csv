I still have kids (Some are now in their 40s and 50s) sit with me reminiscing about the days they came out ice fishing with us. They ranged form 6 to 12 years old back then. My biggest fear having them with me, was if they got board; during the slow times. So I'd have kites for them to fly; almost always enough wind on the lake for that. They had a blast and so did I; but talk about exhausting. LOL Dan."
