1039512,manfish,2019-01-20 18:06:00,24,Where can the Drifter be bought Seabass?
1039530,Sinker,2019-01-21 14:22:00,8692,"Order them direct from Set The Hook. The meegs catches way more. I""ve fished them both side by side, and the meegs is hands down the way to go.  Great video!  S."
1039536,manfish,2019-01-21 14:38:00,24,"Thanks for replying Sinker.I've had little luck with meegs , I love the old speader"

1039556,BillM,2019-01-22 00:31:00,17367,They all work.  Just depends on what the fish want that day
1056207,bigal077,2020-02-09 12:24:00,1,what size jig head do use for ice fishing the Drifter for white fish 
1056228,OhioFisherman,2020-02-10 00:10:00,6623,"I didn't see or hear any indication of the depth of water they were fishing, but if wind and current aren't a factor like thru the ice a 1/8th ounce head is probably fine on a 3 inch lure."
