1056213,Walltrout,2020-02-09 15:04:00,18,Actually ALL tournaments should be outlawed as they are nothing more then another form of commercial fishing.
1056214,Garnet,2020-02-09 15:15:00,2056,"How did spring fishing turn into tournament fishing discussion. I'm a 100% user of the fishing resource. I don't think fishing will be outlawed, it makes me proud every time I see kids show up on the eastern ditches. I was the guy that went to dozens of meeting until the law was changed to all year fishing below CN tracks on all creeks."
1056217,moxie,2020-02-09 16:30:00,1566,When a seconds quick picture or measurement of a an OOS fish is against the law while other real and concerning practices are allowed and deemed legal ( Multiple Tourneys &  Non Regulated Native Fish harvest) it turns into whatever it turns into.
1056218,Terry,2020-02-09 16:41:00,14456,Not releasing OOS fish is illegal tournaments are not peoples moral compass has nothing to do with it and shouldn’t have anything to do with it lets stick with science and the law

1056232,Duckie,2020-02-10 02:43:00,305,completely wrong. commercial fishing is harvesting fish for human consumption. tournaments are always catch and release.
1056234,Walltrout,2020-02-10 10:24:00,18,"Since someone is always making money via a fishing tournament it's a commercial enterprise if you like it or not. And by stating tournaments are catch and release ignores the mortality of the released fish that is sometimes as high as 50% but usually around 25%. Please explain to me how this style of commercial fishing is good for the fish population. Trust me, I'm not a tree hugger and I have no plans to gather some of those nut cases to protest at your tournament. I am just trying to open your eyes to what they really are. Would you support a small gill netting operation on your favorite lakes so Fresh Water Fillets of North America can make some easy money while the netting is good and then move on to the next lake that hasn't been netted out YET. Have you ever noticed the organizers for fishing tournaments never go to almost sterile lakes to hold their money making scheme. https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2009/08/02/In-catch-and-release-angling-competitions-freed-bass-still-face-risk/stories/200908020169"

Im sure the fishing and boating industry can survive off of people that fish 1 weekend a year during their vacation, that own one rod and fish with a bobber and a worm lol The money spent by tournament anglers doesnt help the local economy or generate tax revenue at all so lets just cancel everything. The tri-lakes are really short on numbers of largemouth. 🙄  You live in Canada...if you want to fish world class bass populations that see 0 angling pressure...drive 2.5 hours and fish them?"
1056241,SirCranksalot,2020-02-10 14:02:00,3291,And that's the sad part of this whole thread!!
1056242,Sinker,2020-02-10 15:17:00,8692,"You didn't fish the tri lakes 10-20-30 years ago. The bass fishing, and all other species, is garbage compared to what it was then. Also, there is a lot more tourneys, with a lot more anglers fishing them. Hmmmm.... Tournaments are just a way for someone to get rich. Not the anglers, but someone is making a lot of money somewhere. As for spring fishing, just go fish. If you catch something out of season, release it. Its really that simple. Don't target out of season fish, and you are fine.   S."
1056250,AKRISONER,2020-02-11 11:59:00,5558,"🤔    the fishing decline Couldn’t have anything to do with the population of southern Ontario increasing by 35%? Theres so many factors at play here specifically in the kawarthas, and that’s why you see other municipalities enforcing laws for the purposes of protecting shorelines and water quality. every cottage on the lakes basically has a giant retaining wall and have destroyed the majority of the natural shoreline on those lakes. The lakes are full of algae, The water levels are absolutely all over the place, Invasive species, guys running seadoos right over top of bedded fish non stop, increased fishing pressure etc etc the number 1 factor? Humans...humans are negatively impacting the lakes. The more humans, the more the lakes will suffer. im not saying Tournament fishing doesn’t have a negative effect on bass populations, anything that disturbs the fish does, but saying it’s all because of tournaments is basically pointing fingers. As far as I’m aware, everything done in tournaments is within the confines of the law and furthermore extreme care is taken to try to lower unintentional kills. i guess ya we could all go back to the methods of the 70’s...and kill every single fish we see and eat it. Musky is delicious. "

1056548,Sinker,2020-02-20 18:49:00,8692,"Yeah, but how does that benefit the fishery? "
1056549,OhioFisherman,2020-02-20 19:02:00,6623,"I recall Pointe Au Baril in the 60's and 70's, every camp we stayed at there seemed to designate one evening for a "" fish fry "" a non participant myself, but due to the lack of walleye at that time smallmouth bass and panfish filled the menu. Things like that certainly didn't benefit the fishery?"
1056551,Terry,2020-02-20 19:27:00,14456,Part of every entry fee went back to the fishery and they hired biologists to do studies on fish and fish habitat And  you typed let’s hear the benefits not benefits to the fishery unless I misunderstood 
1056567,AKRISONER,2020-02-21 02:49:00,5558,"Same logic as ducks unlimited people that don’t fish don’t give a damn about the fishery. Ask some of the local businesses in bridgenorth if they like having the tournaments come through. i don’t think anyone here is arguing that if we all just practiced occasional catch and release it would be better for the fish populations. But then you are literally proposing that the entire industry basically collapse. Bass fishing makes the freshwater fishing industry go round...it’s massive in the USA and is the reason we have big graphs, trolling motors etc etc on our boats. Much like F1 and tech that we have in our cars.  as long as it’s within the confines of the law then so be it. If the laws need to be changed then we should be advocating for it as such. "
1056568,Musky Plug,2020-02-21 04:57:00,398,It is a good place for information however sometimes people can get bend out of shape when talking about topics like fishing OOS. I think your question while completely innocent rubbed a few the wrong way.
1056569,Musky Plug,2020-02-21 05:01:00,398,"I don't fish tournaments and have no ambition to but I disagree with this statement. Tournaments can be a good thing for a local economy. Bringing people who wouldn't normally visit the area to that specific area and spend money. On the flip side I understand I think tourney's should make the move to the MLF style format with the fish released immediately after caught to stop delayed mortality or fish dying in a heated box. However I can appreciate the ""weigh in"" portion of the tournaments can be a crowd draw too. I fish a few lakes in the Waubaushene area that I think that have been directly affected by tournaments. SMB and LMB are virtually none existent in a lake and some what in the connecting lakes that I go to that used to have them and you could catch them frequently. Some of the locals also seem to think this as well as very few participants of the tournaments used to fish the lakes but since the word got out more and more participants fish them during the tournaments and take the fish and they don't return.   Agreed."
1056570,Musky Plug,2020-02-21 05:05:00,398,I like this idea but who knows the actual amount if any that makes it there.
1056579,Sinker,2020-02-21 14:50:00,8692,"Ducks unlimited maintains and creates habitat, so no, its not the same logic at all.  They don't even support hunters any more, its all about habitat. Bass tourneys do not benefit the fishery at all. Its all a cash grab. Glitter boats tearing up the lakes, and killing a lot of fish.  Sure, bring a few hundred people into any community it will generate revenue, but wheres the real benefit?? I value the actual fish, more than a few bucks in a small town. Without the fish, we are screwed. These guys should be doing more work to improve the fishing, not make it worse. Legal, yes.

1055123,BoneAmie,2020-01-17 01:48:00,5,"Hi all, I could use some advice. I am primarily an artificial lure bass fisher in zone 18. I would like to fish in the spring and bass season doesn't start until the third week of June. The regulations state that not only do you have to release any bass that you might catch before bass season opens, but you also cannot TARGET bass.  I would like to know what lures I can use for other species (crappie, pike) so that I can 1) catch them and 2) not appear to be bass fishing if I am challenged by authorities or, as is more often the case, cottagers who don't want anyone to fish and use the bass off-season argument to demand that you stop. Bass might be caught on just about any lure, but how do I lower the odds and still catch quality fish? Thanks for any advice."
1055125,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-17 02:18:00,8243,"That sounds like subliminal cheating to me Mr. 1 post. I don't think anyone here will be helping you ""not appear to be bass fishing"". I will suggest though that you do not fish where Bass are known to spawn i.e. spawning beds or structure where Bass tend to spawn before the 3rd Saturday in June, not the 3rd week. If the regs. say 3rd week you could start fishing on the Sunday of the 3rd week. Sorry I won't be of anymore help to you. edit: I can't help myself. Those cottagers that you think they don't want you to fish where you are and appear to be using the ""off season"" argument are doing exactly that. They most likely know the structure where they live and you are fishing where Bass are spawning. That's deemed to be targeting spawning fish before the season opener to me. If one has zero idea where Bass spawn that is not an argument to get out of a fine. Especially when you have been warned by some mean cottager."
1055126,BoneAmie,2020-01-17 02:36:00,5,"Hi Old Ironmaker, I apologize for not being clear, and I see that I may have implied something that was not my intent. I absolutely do not want to fish for bass out of season. I want to fish for other species in the spring when the weather is nice. By ""appear""  I mean, if i am using, for example, a curly-tail grub for crappie, that's also a decent smallmouth bait. Would an official challenge that? Your point about beds is well taken, and I do stay off spawning areas pre-bass season. I'm asking because the term ""target"" in the regs is unclear. If I use a large senko it's pretty likely I'm targeting largemouth, so I don't use them at all then. But, it's not that definitive for some lures.  I'm trying to enjoy legal fishing in the spring and stay well within the rules, and catch some stuff. I release everything anyway, including in-season bass. Thanks."
1055128,Terry,2020-01-17 02:48:00,14456,"Fact is if you are using crappie bait , light line and have some crappie in your live well. If people or a CO sees you catching bass and not moving to get away from out of season fish they can still charge you"
1055130,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-17 03:04:00,8243,"What Terry wrote BoneAmie. No CO is going to hammer you when you are loaded with Crappie bait and tackle. If you are indeed fishing crappie it most likely be almost on shore in fallen bush or trees. Close to docks with a float and micro lures. I wouldn't worry about hooking into a Smallie there, they shouldn't be anywhere near there. Even Largemouth I would think unless they are pre or post spawn. Don't bring a half dozen flippin' sticks and baitcasters all pre rigged or a med action spinning outfits pre rigged and trays of traditional Bass hardware and you will be just fine. I can only go on what you wrote and what I read. Welcome aboard OFC, the best fishing and everything else that is useful and non political or religious site anywhere.

1055132,BoneAmie,2020-01-17 03:44:00,5,"Hi Old Ironmaker, Thank you for straightening me out in your edited post but again you misunderstand me. I don't think cottage owners are mean, although some don't understand fishing. I am a cottage owner myself, and I know the lake well. And many owners on our lake do not approve of fishing in any way, including catch-and-release.  For example, I am always very respectful of boundaries and personal space. If people are out on their dock, I go around. Yet I have been yelled at from the shore more thank a few times. My favorites include ""there aren't any fish in this bay"" or ""you're not supposed to be fishing now"". One guy threatened to throw a rock at me. I politely explain the regs, but it falls on deaf ears. It's usually an environmental argument that even though you have paid for a license, you are harming nature, or being cruel. Negative comments have gotten bad on our local Facebook page every time someone posts a legal fish pic. And, there was recently a lengthy discussion about how fishermen shouldn't fish around docks because they have a whole big lake to use! Some folks recently started a new Facebook group where you are permitted to post pictures of legally taken fish and game, which is not tolerated on the original page. I was sincerely looking for fishing advice, yet being challenged like I'm a scofflaw and certainly not getting the benefit of the doubt. I thought this would be a place to get help from more experienced fishermen."
1055133,BoneAmie,2020-01-17 03:49:00,5,Terry and Old Ironmaker I did want to thank you for the good advice on light tackle. I did only use my ultralight rod last spring. Wish we could get a response from a provincial rep to say what they look for specifically.
1055150,OhioFisherman,2020-01-17 15:52:00,6623,"I am probably going to side with Terry on this, some of our best spring time fishing was in places that a bunch of different species spawned in, and sometimes their spawning seasons overlapped. Depending on the spring weather you might catch crappie, bluegill, large and smallmouth bass or an occasional northern pike from the same marina in shallow water."
1056079,north560,2020-02-05 15:34:00,38,"The rules read ""Fish accidentally caught during closed season must be immediatly released"" So pick any lure that is not used by you for bass in your tackle box and if you do catch a bass release it. Bass are going to hit anything that invades their area it happens. Up our way there is no closed season for bass , and it doesn't matter what you use they will take it if it passes near their beds."

I fish pike in the early spring using swimbaits and obviously end up running into angry smallmouth, it’s unavoidable, the point is that if you find one you return it as quickly as possible and move on."
1056095,moxie,2020-02-06 01:27:00,1566,No pictures? Is that in the regs? Nice fish is gonna hit the ruler at the very least. A really nice fish will be released immediately after the shutter click .
