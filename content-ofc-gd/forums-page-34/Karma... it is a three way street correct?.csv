962257,irishfield,2016-03-13 03:29:00,26272,I know what you're talking about now... girl that turns her leg upside down sitting in the wheel chair. That's not Jen.. but suspect that whom ever it is she has had a similar hemipelvectomy and had seen Jen's youtube videos from about 2 years prior. Certainly hope she's still smiling!
962267,bigugli,2016-03-13 09:42:00,6138,"Wayne, I know that your family 's story has helped myself, and  numerous others, understand and cope with the ordeal that is cancer. I realize this is small consolation for the loss of your daughter, but from my house to yours, thank you"
962287,Big Cliff,2016-03-13 14:05:00,6899,"Jen's courage, your and Leah's strength have been a huge source of inspiration to both Sue and I in dealing with our daughters cancer. This thread may eventually; as you put it ""drift off into history"" but the help it has provided others will remain in our hearts for as long as we live!"
962288,glenner,2016-03-13 14:20:00,56,"Wayne, we have never met and I have never even shared a post with you before, but I followed every inch of the journey that you posted on here. Every time I logged in and saw that your post had new messages on it, I held my breath when I opened it to hopefully read that you were sharing good news for your and your family. Often you were, and then would come news of a setback that you Leah and Jen seemed to handle time and again with incredible courage and optimism. I don't think I have ever been as affected by reading of the highs and lows of the struggles of someone else as I was with yours and I applaud your family and your courage for allowing us to travel this road with you and gain some little insight into a truly remarkable young lady."

Thanks for letting us follow your journey sir. I know the memories will never stop,but great friends and family support,what else is there .Thank You,and all the best to you and yours sincerely.   Dave."
962562,irishfield,2016-03-14 22:25:00,26272,"Dave I said it elsewhere... but during Jen's birthday week (11 days actually) I was hanging with a great group of friends. They understood my mental state, let me do my own thing and accommodated my every foot step. I'm sure it wasn't easy for them, but they took it in stride like true friends do. Even let me stay in bed on Tuesday, past Lloyd oclock, after 4 nights of minimal sleep and I just wasn't up for a full day on the lake. They did their thing and I did mine, mine being getting up late and then running to town a few times to get some summer items shuttled out to the island from my enclosed trailer to make life easier for Leah and I this summer."
962589,Whopper,2016-03-15 00:36:00,2174,Wayne the three other guys on the couch are the lucky ones. Good to see you get out enjoy your place and do some fishing.
965688,irishfield,2016-04-07 22:57:00,26272,"Well for one final entry on this thread, I've confirmed the old saying that the only guarantees in life are death and taxes. I have hopefully filed Jen's last tax return and will be able to get a clearance certificate in due time after the assessment notice comes back. Sent Trudeau and Wynne another $13,000 and change on Jen's behalf, despite her disability credit and medical expenses.  Oh well, it is what it is and we keep putting one foot in front of the other. Thanks for hanging in there with us for 5.5 years."
965762,bpsbassman,2016-04-08 14:32:00,941,"Yes Wayne, the only guarantees in life are death and taxes.  What is not guaranteed is having an incredible set of parents.  Jen was very blessed to have that and she led an incredible life and was a true inspiration (and continues to be) to so many of us. Rest in Peace Jen."

Climbing the stairs to the top of the CN tower with no hip took a huge amount of bravery and intestinal fortitude. That is how it has to be fought. She inspired me through my own battle, I thought I had it bad, nope, this young girl had it worse and did not let it slow her down. As far as this kid is concerned, Jen is a true Canadian hero."
1056802,irishfield,2020-02-27 04:33:00,26272,"Just killing myself by browsing back through this, about 8 hours before Jen would turn 35 at 8 in the AM. Thanks to all for keeping me sane for almost 10 years and the same group of great guys I had up at my camp last week for allowing me to do my own thing each day ...while my brain continues to keep me awake a night!

1056823,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-27 21:59:00,8243,We need to keep this thread alive. 10 years since Wayne first posted it and  an inspiration to us all. Just yesterday we found out a close friend that beat Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma 5 years ago she told me that it is back. F the C word.
1056829,Pigeontroller,2020-02-28 01:27:00,2793,"We should be thanking you Wayne, and Jen, for inspiring all of us!"

930409,irishfield,2015-08-20 02:48:00,26272,"Thanks guys, working our way through the maze of lawyers, banks and bull with an end goal for a nice Celebration of Life on the 30th for Jennifer. Thanks to our younger daughter we have most of the picture boards done, the hall is booked and organized, caterer is booked (and a PITA). Bar is stocked, etc with Jen's favourite beverage available.  A word of advise for all of you young or old. Find out what your banks policy is on death and no will. Luckily we had Jen add Leah as joint on all her accounts at the BnS a few years ago, as she was going through the paces against this disease. Unfortunately some wiz bang telemarketer convinced Jen to switch her main account, to gain 0.2%, to the latest greatest plan back in March (after 3 craniotomies and full head radiation). Leah's name didn't follow on the account. What should have been a simple housekeeping item last week became an appeal by our local bank branch manager against corporate headquarters. For the first time in her history as a bank employee (25 years) she saw them agree to pay all probate fees that will be caused by this mess. It could have easily gone the other way costing Jen's estate thousand of dollars. I guess the good thing is the BnScotia is only a 3 to 4 week affair. We asked at the Bank of Montreal what their corporate policy is and they lock all accounts for 364 days if there is no will!!! Consider a little old lady who's husband has all their money in an account at the BMO and he passes away. She instantly has no access to any funds to buy groceries or pay for his funeral unless she is smart enough to go in and withdraw or transfer ahead of anyone knowing he's gone. It was only 6 years ago that my Mother's accounts, that were joint with each of 4 kids, were easily just transferred to each of us on the spot, same day. As of 2 or 3 years ago the law changed and luckily the BnS is only 3 or 4 weeks... others like the BMO could be a year without funds for you or your family members."

I met and spent some time with Wayne about ten years ago and have been proud to call him my friend ever since. I, like many others here have followed Jen's journey since day one and am truly inspired. After attending yesterdays ""Celebration of Life"" I can see exactly where Jen got her strength/drive from. Even though Jen is no longer with us physically Wayne and Leah should be really proud to have raised a daughter that has given so much to so many.  A couple other comments from yesterday, Wayne's son looks exactly like a younger version of Wayne, heard through the grapevine that a couple traveled farther than I did to be there, put some faces to some names that I had never met before, saw some people I've not seen in a long time and lastly, Wayne I hope the bar bill didn't sting you to bad, just be glad I wasn't drinking or it would have been worst and I would have ended up in your hanger  Wayne and Leah, thanks so much for sharing Jen's journey with us"
932093,irishfield,2015-08-31 20:00:00,26272,"Thanks so much for sharing the day with us Joe, Teri, Will, Andy, Phil, Maureen, Paul and I hope I didn't miss speaking to anyone! Amazing the gravitational pull she had on some people, like Whopper, that travelled half way across the continent to be there... yet some family and people that we highly expected to be there couldn't travel 6 blocks to pay their respects. The couple that Phil (Whopper) mentions flew up to Buffalo from Witchita, Kansas and then rented a car to drive to town on Friday just to take us out for supper. They left home at 4 am and were in our house at 4pm. The closest they could get a room was Barrie and they returned again on Sunday for the C of L and then had to leave after about 1.5 hours into it to get back to Buffalo for their flight home. To quote Marc Thorpe, they were some of my ""part time long distance pretend internet friends"" from an airplane forum.  We know that not everyone signed the guest book coming in, as Leah and I greeted every person that entered the room, but a quick tally shows 227 names in the book!  Phil we went back to the MCC today to pay the bar tab (that the bartender told me was about $2400 when we left yesterday) only to find out it had been anonymously paid on our behalf this morning. "

You and your wife are the measuring sticks of what parenting is and should be. I've read every friggin page of this thread and I'm torn up inside, I've shared your highs and lows and Jen always had her family by her side. I'm confident she knows that and will always have that wherever she is. I'm no author but think about putting this experience to paper it will help a ton of people going through the same thing. Walking through this journey with you via this platform (Ofc)has made me a better parent using you as a model and I thank you and your beautiful family for that! I'm not a religious man but I'm not so ignorant as to not recognise this life isn't the be all and end all,you stuck by her side and you best believe she will return the favour!

What would have been Jen's 31st Birthday was on Feb 27th and we continue to move forward here at home the best we can, reflecting back on what we did right and what we may have done wrong. Considering everything we've seen around us the past 5+ years, when dealing with Ewing's, we're pretty settled to say we got it pretty much right and nothing else we may have done would have changed the outcome and we, over time, can hopefully live with that. That said it doesn't help us sleep at night and Leah is still at a loss looking for that letter Jen told her that she wrote to her, but we continue to get up each day and carry on the best we can.  In a few days time I will ask Roy or Art to lock this thread down, so it can drift off into history with the memories it holds... but not before I print and save it in it's entirety!"

Many times I was sitting here in tears reading or watching Jen walk. Her fight was amazing even though everyone knew what the end would be. We are all so lucky to have found each other in the OFC family to comfort and be there for everyone. Like Speedtrolls journey with Chris I feel as if I lost a daughter in Jenifer.  Jen will always be in my heart she gave light to so many thank you for letting us live the last 5 years with you.

Feeling revealed when you had good news, and feeling down when you didn't. We would often talk about Jen's fight over the phone (me in Ottawa and him in Niagara-on-the-Lake) whenever there was new news. I even had the privilege of talking with Jen via e-mail after donating to her her gutsy walk a few years ago. She was defiantly a special young lady and a real inspiration to us all.  RIP Jen.

I've followed your journey albeit not making many comments. But like others have stated, your daughter was an inspiration to us all.  My wife and I came close to living the pain of such a loss as this past April and May, our 37 yr old daughter was striken with menengitis and encephylitis. She spent 5 weeks in ICU at Hamilton General, with half of that not really conscious, unable to walk and feed herself. She has recovered to some degree but her prognosis is still uncertain. This came out of the blue to a bright, witty and well educated teacher who is unable to return to work for the foreseeable future. Life can change is a hurry."

I have never met you or your family yet I feel a profound sadness .. you are all in our thoughts. God Bless.
927199,woodenboater,2015-08-01 23:01:00,2277,"wow, speechless and so sad to hear about the latest developments   I fully expected her (and still harbour faint hope since she's one tough mudder) to bust down the doors and surprise everyone.  take care to you and your family  wb"
927200,pics,2015-08-01 23:45:00,1268,My thoughts are with your family tonight.. she's one tough cookie!!
927204,Dutch,2015-08-02 00:17:00,831,So very sorry for you and your family.  Celebrate her for the amazing fighter she is.
927207,Tomcat,2015-08-02 00:30:00,395,So very very sorry to hear this latest news Wayne.
927210,ketchenany,2015-08-02 00:40:00,3229,"Wayne, in 2011 I was in the same boat, my mom, we knew it was coming to an end, the memories are still with us? Our grandkids who knew her, still say she was the BIG Nonna. remember the good times as you told me."
919046,bucktail,2015-06-08 18:22:00,1857,"Excellent news , always thinking of you and your family!!"
919779,irishfield,2015-06-12 23:31:00,26272,"Jen got an automated phone call out of the blue the other night, reminding her to be at her Friday 8:15 AM MRI at Sunnybrook. Good thing they reminder call, as nobody mailed or phoned to tell her this was happening. Yesterday Dr Sahgal called Jen to say he wanted to see her next Wednesday.  Leah and Jen made the decision to go last night vs trying to get into the city this morning in the rain. After Jen spent 2.5 hours packing (OCD and morphine..) they finally got in to the city last night at about 2am.. got to bed at 3 and then had some stupid alarm going off every hour in Jen's power panel cabinet. Up at 6:55 and across the city for Sunnybrook. Jen had her head MRI and while that was happening Leah went looking for Sahgal and managed to get him to see Jen shortly after the MRI, to at least save one trip and an extra day in the city. ""All looks good"" is all they got from him in the waiting room and ""I'll book another scan and see you in about 2 months"".  So GOOD news there and now the wait for everything else she's having scanned on Tuesday. Lungs, Lumbar sacral spine and another head MRI at Sinai for their tracking.  Bad news is her pain that revolves around her body is so severe, especially when it's in her spine, that she's sometimes taking 60 mg of slow release morphine per day and additional 1 or 2mg hydromorphone tabs as needed in between just to dull the pain. That would put any of us out like a light. Thankfully we have my buddy Dr Helt coming by the house regularly and Rob called Dr Razak and had the Lumbar spine CT (or MRI) added onto Tuesdays schedule to rule out that there is nothing new going on there and that it's just the Pazopanib pills that are causing this as a side effect of the drug. Hope like hell it's the drug.  Jen is doing the cancer walk tomorrow night in the city with some of her gfriends. Hopefully with one of them or Leah pushing Jen in a chair, but we know how stubborn she is so I'm sure she'll at least walk the last little way of the victor lap.  I imagine they'll be staying in Jen's apartment until Tuesday, as Jen can't handle much extra moving around, and I'll be driving down to Mt Sinai for the Razak appointment on Tuesday afternoon. Will update again once we're back from that.. could be Wednesday pending Jen's ability to travel."
919782,ketchenany,2015-06-13 00:00:00,3229,"Spirits up Wayne, a lot of thoughts coming your way. One though one you have there.  maybe you can get one of the Manzone boys to do the driving, they were really good behind the wheel and give you guys a break"
919808,irishfield,2015-06-13 03:20:00,26272,"If any are so inclined, this is Jen's donation page for the Relay for Life tomorrow. This will be the 5th consecutive year that she's walked, all while fighting Ewing's Sarcoma. Some years she's walked both in Toronto and Midland.  "
920376,irishfield,2015-06-17 06:32:00,26272,"Well I'm glad you folks all kept hoping! No new signs of the disease anywhere that was scanned, including her spine, after 10 weeks on this nasty drug. The fair sized spot that they've been monitoring on her left lung looks like a plant that's been attacked by bugs. March's CTs shows a solid mass and todays CT appears as being partially eaten and full of holes. Her Oncologist was pleasantly and honestly surprised by that, as there is absolutely no data or known history when using this drug on Ewing's! Since it appears this Pazo drug is working, she will stay on it but her Oncologist has cut it back by having her go 3 weeks on and 1 off, instead of full time. Starting tomorrow she's taking her week off so this should tell us by weeks end if it's what's causing the extreme pain for her."
920379,spincast,2015-06-17 08:54:00,3279,That's just awesome. ! Great news!

920441,fishnsled,2015-06-17 17:44:00,3520,Great news Wayne.  Hopefully the break will give Jen some relief.
920463,bigbuck,2015-06-17 20:09:00,2449,"Great news Wayne!!! Good to hear that although it is hard on her, the new drug is kicking some butt in Jen's body."
927066,irishfield,2015-08-01 07:35:00,26272,"Amazing and unfortunate how quickly things can change in just 6 weeks. Jennifer is days, possibly hours away from the inevitable as her body shuts down and the Sarcoma has taken it over. Leah and myself have been taking turns sitting with Jen 24 hours a day and the other two kids are filling in when they can. She hasn't eaten or drank anything for at least a month. Blood transfusion and saline iv's for re hydration have made no difference, and even if they did the Sarcoma is showing up at C3/C4 as well as her pelvic / rib area of her spine. She now has a hospital bed in our front room and stronger pain meds have made her more comfortable. All other medications have been stopped and the focus is on no pain and dignity, and we've filled out the DNR forms. We are not available for phone calls; we want all our time to be spent with her. I welcome emails and will respond if necessary when I can. Only medical professionals and our own small immediate family is allowed inside the house now. It is better if everyone remembers her happy smile, instead of what she looks like now. We're not looking for any sage advice, as we've had 5yrs to run this through our heads at every twist and turn that she took with her inspirational fight. I just wanted you to know that her journey is almost over and she will soon be pain free. Thanks for holding our hands, Wayne and Leah PLEASE - NO posts on facebook, Jen has friends that still don't know that are ""friends"" of Leah's."
927067,lew,2015-08-01 08:30:00,12766,"Honestly Wayne, I wish I had the proper words to say to you but I don't.  This is such sad news but at least her pain will be over.  You guys are in my thoughts."

927094,bow slayer,2015-08-01 13:25:00,1074,I have been following this post from the beginning hoping for a miracle and a better outcome because if anybody deserved one it was her.She is an amazing person as are you and your family . Her and your families strength and spirit throughout this has been incredible. I wish i could offer more than my thoughts and prayers.
906033,Nipfisher,2015-03-26 00:40:00,2449,"Wayne, I just caught up on the last 4-6 pages and WOW!. I am so happy the new drug treatment will be covered. I hope Jen gets some well needed rest to recover."
907420,irishfield,2015-04-01 05:39:00,26272,"Well, that was a LONG day after picking Jen up from her apartment just after noon today (we left home at 10:20). Oncology was a cluster.. today at Mt Sinai, with unscheduled patients and emergency consults bumping us by almost 5 hours. But hey, we've done the same to others and just have to take it in stride... unlike the impatient Doctor that couldn't comprehend having to wait ""an hour"" to see his Oncologist. I almost took him out...  to save him the wait. Never seen someone make such a scene in the 5 years we've been going there.  Jen had her head and full body CT's on Monday (30th)... saw the Doc today.. well yesterday by now. Lung spots have grown a millimeter or two in the past 6/7 weeks, but the radiation seems to have done it's job at this point for her skull / brain. Nothing new showing and what was being fully radiated seems to have subsided a bit, so it at least worked on what was there before the latest radiation. I know it's done something, as Jen is back to her bubbly self again. Very few headaches, although still easily tired which of course is a side effect of radiation.  Got her script for the new Pazopanib, with just 2 minutes to spare before the pharmacy closed. Much to our surprise it was ONLY $4891.07 CDN for a months worth of pills. Cheapest I could find, as noted in the last update was over $8800 US$'s for the American folks here.  So she came home with us, to see how she reacts to this drug. Just wasn't a good idea to leave her ""home alone"". She has an appointment again in 4 weeks to consult what her side effects have been and if a few key things do go to hell before that we screw up their scheduling like others did to us today. Just how it works, but hopefully she can stick to 4 weeks and this stuff keeps anything new at bay. The goal is to keep her stable for a time period so we can get her into an immune therapy trial."
907426,Big Cliff,2015-04-01 10:08:00,6899,"Good on you for keeping your cool, you just have to shake your head sometimes at some of the antics that go on in these waiting rooms. Glad to hear there is some progress in Jen's condition and we'll continue with the good thoughts and prayers!  Cliff & Sue"
907451,bigbuck,2015-04-01 13:28:00,2449,The joys of hurrying up to wait. A Dr getting upset because he had to wait......what a morooon! I am quite sure he never ever made one of his patients ever have to wait. Thankfully the radiation has helped and hopefully the new meds will get things under wraps. Good luck Jen!!!!! There are A LOT of people who have never met you that are praying for you.
907471,Headhunter,2015-04-01 14:38:00,5703,^^^^ x a million! HH
911689,bpsbassman,2015-04-22 17:58:00,941,Just catching up with this thread Wayne.  Been wondering how things were going. Sounds like pretty good news. Prayers continue.
911712,irishfield,2015-04-22 19:40:00,26272,"Thanks Roger! Been a long three weeks.. her days consist of 14 hours in bed and 10 on the couch.. repeat. Even skipped going to card making at the cancer centre this afternoon, which really tells us things are the greatest as she's never missed a Wednesday afternoon of card making.  MRI on her head / brain at Sunnybrook on Friday and sees her Oncologist next Tuesday to discuss the drug she's on. Then see's her radiation Oncologist (for her head) 2 weeks from today to go over the MRI and learn that hopefully everything is remaining stable up stairs."
913166,irishfield,2015-05-01 00:26:00,26272,"Well Jennifer has been on this Pazopanib $$$$ pill for a month now. It started out okay, but after 2 weeks she began to have severe body pains just about everywhere. Constant pains that seem to move about her body and she's never far from the heating pad. Into week 3 her appetite disappeared, while still hungry she just doesn't have the energy to eat and things stick in her throat. When she does finally think that she can eat, she then feels nauseous and can’t. The routine has become 14 hours in bed and then 10 on the couch.. repeat with Leah waiting on her hand and foot trying anything and everything to get her to nibble and drink. Generally we all get to bed about 3am each night... so don't anyone call here before noon.  Last Friday Jen and Leah headed for Sunnybrook for a scheduled head MRI. Afterwards, Jennifer just wasn't capable to make the drive back home so they stayed in Jen's apartment right through to Tuesday for her appointment with her Medical Oncologist at Mt. Sinai. Again a scheduled appointment to discuss the pill she is on and hopefully to get some answers as to how she is expected to function on it, as week 4 got even worse for pain, tiredness and almost no food intake / day. The hope was that maybe the dose would be reduced, due to her small size and the fact that everyone seems to get prescribed the same 4 pill dose / day from what we've read.  Sunday morning rolls around and the Radiation Oncologist from Sunnybrook calls Jennifer on her cell phone. She is not scheduled to see him until May 6th so him calling (himself, not an assistant) on a Sunday morning right after Fridays MRI raises the red flag pretty quickly. He tells her he needs to see her CT disc from before Radiation, as he can't get it up on his computer, and that he might need to give her another ""bump"" (more radiation) and that he must see her on Tuesday before she goes to her Medical Oncologist. Of course this phone call brings nothing but shivers down our spines as to what the sudden urgency is.  So Tuesday at Sunnybrook he just wanted to see the disc from before Radiation... and maybe should have said that instead of scaring the crap out of everyone by calling her on a Sunday morning and telling her to come see him Tuesday before going to Mt Sinai to see Dr. Razak. He is happy with what he sees after the full head radiation... although there is some residual tumour left behind. He hopes that the Pazopanib she's on will take care of it. Read, even though she probably needs it, he can’t give her a radiation “bump” without her coming off of the Pazopanib and that’s not an option!  Just an hour and a half later she's sees Dr Razak at Mt Sinai. He is happy with her blood work, blood pressure, thyroid and kidney functions are still good (amazing enough) and he wants her to stay on the Pazopanib, at the current strength, and will see her in 4 to 6 weeks for new lung  (still monitoring those two spots in her lung) and new head CTs. He apologises to her for what the drug is putting her though, but there is not much he can do and she needs to stay the course. Allowed Codeine for the pain as needed or her Hydromorphone. Neither are sufficient to take care of what Jen describes as someone trying to jam a broom stick through her, or a knife in her back.  After her Tuesday afternoon visit with Dr Razak they headed back to her apartment to pack and come home. Jen immediately went to sleep instead. Around 9 she woke up, Leah and her packed and hit the road at about 10:30pm.. arriving home at 1am after a Tim Horton's stop for soup. It’s now 2 days later.. not much has changed, other than the pain is in a new spot today on her left hip.  Hopefully this rotating pain runs out of places to appear and she gets back to some comfort in the days to come. It’s going to be a long 6 weeks before the next Dr. visit at this rate and hopefully her scans, when that day rolls around, will at least bring continuing good news and not more bad. Still not sure when and if she’ll transition from this Pazopanib to an experimental trial, but we’ll cross that bridge when it’s built.  Wayne and Leah"
913167,Gallie,2015-05-01 00:31:00,1215,"My heart goes out to all of you, i hope she feels a little better soon."

Jennifer actually got off the couch and came to the dinner table for steak and potatoes tonight. A first in about 8 weeks! Didn't eat a lot, but a huge step from where she's been the past 2 months, with the first real meals in that entire time frame happening in the past week only. Prior she was probably consuming less than 100 calories a day on this nasty $$$$ drug. Has it in her mind she's doing the cancer walk in Toronto next weekend as well... or at least the victory lap.

Gives her Sunday to rest and then one of her friends takes her to radiation on Monday am. Our younger daughter Kristal is taking Monday afternoon off work to go to Toronto and take Jen out to a concert at Massey Hall, then will drop her off at Sunnybrook on Tuesday morning for Radiation, before heading for Barrie to work.

904534,irishfield,2015-03-18 22:45:00,26272,"Well folks, to continue from where we had updated you a few weeks ago... Jennifer has finished up her 10 days of full head / brain radiation, with Dr. Sahgal at Sunnybrook, as of Thursday (Mar 12th). Leah has spent the past 2 weeks in Toronto with Jen taking her back and forth to Sunnybrook and sleeping on her love seat couch. I stayed home to give them a bit of room in Jen's little apartment and to get a few things done around here with Spring around the corner and bills needing to be paid. Jen seems to be doing okay after the latest ordeal. The ""bump"" (that was a large skull tumour) seems to have disappeared for the most part .... but none of us are dumb enough to know this is the final hurdle for her. Even if she is fortunate enough that this full head radiation was the magic to stop these ""floaters"" from finding a new spot to grow in her brain, she still has two spots in her left lung to monitor and deal with as time progresses. She (we) saw her Oncologist, Dr Razak at Mt Sinai, yesterday afternoon and as discussed the last time she saw him there aren't any chemotherapy cocktails ""left in the cupboard"" for Jennifer. Dr. Blackstein had ""stretched every string"" he could in her battle to this point. Dr Razak had previously mentioned Experimental Immune Therapy, but Jen has to be stable for a good period of time before she can even be allowed to start one of those trials. What was decided yesterday is that she needs 3 weeks (from last Thursday) to let the radiation continue to do it's thing and importantly for her to recover from the effects. She is to be back to see him on March 31st for another full body CT and a head / brain CT. These will be used to set bench marks while he then tries a drug called Pazopanib, which is a potent and selective multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tumour growth and inhibits new blood vessels from growing. This will be used to see if it can keep her stable long enough (or maybe even knock the spots out of her lungs). It's at least hoped that it will stop any new head or body tumours from developing, so that she can start the immune therapy trials in a few months. He advised us that the ""Pazopanib is about $5000 / month and I'll have you on it for two months to start"". When Leah and I got home last night I looked it up and from what I can find the average is $8800 US dollars a month for 120 pills ($11,000 Cdn). We are still waiting to find out if her current drug plan will cover her for this medicine, as OHIP certainly does not, and I guess we'll learn the real cost on March 31st if she gets to fill a prescription. Jennifer wanted to be left on her own in the city for the two weeks until her next appointment, so I cooked her a good supply of beef stroganoff last night while Leah and Jen went grocery shopping. Leah headed for home about 10 pm and myself about 10:30, somehow we arrived about 2 minute apart! Jen seemed content and happy to have her place back to herself. I'm sure that there will be a few ""eyes"" checking in on Jen over the next 2 weeks and we'll pick her up on the 31st for her Doctor's appointment. There may be a need for a ride to Sinai for her CT's prior to that, if they happen not to be on the 31st. From there we see how the new drug works and keep pushing forward."

I know that won't help you guys but I sure hope you can come up with something.  There's some insane prices on getting healthy and I often wonder what folks do who can't afford some of these things."

Ask her Dr what can be done. 5k a month can wipe out any savings you have real quick, esp if she needs to be on it longer term. Hopefully Sunlife will cover it, I guess that is her Extended Health provider for her Group coverage through work. You are going to need to squawk loudly now. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

900227,irishfield,2015-02-26 01:41:00,26272,"Post I sent to immediate family on Sunday Night:  Seems to be like trying to kill a vampire...  I left, at 6am on the 12th, for a boys 10 day ice fishing trip to our Temagami camp thinking all was going well. Jen let me leave with the guys and then told Leah at about 1pm that day that she had a new bump above her left ear. She didn't want to spoil my trip, so waited until I was at destination before saying anything! Leah let me have 8 days before sending me a text, telling me that she thought I should have a days notice at least to burn off some steam and do any maintenance the place needed before coming home ....as who knows when we can go back up North.  Bump is the size of a Toonie.. and sticking out a good 1/4"" from normal head shape (which is bigger than her first skull tumour bump and the actual tumour then was the size of a hockey puck). Mount Sinai here we come on Tuesday afternoon for her already planned ""neck down"" check up (CT was last week) and they have been made aware of her new skull issue and are trying to get her a CT of her skull and brain on Tuesday as well. That way her Oncologist can hopefully find some new direction for treatment and also that hopefully it's just a single tumour. Can't see them doing a 4th craniotomy.  Post I sent Monday night to family:  Still no call back on a head CT.. so I guess we get the normally scheduled neck down check up and see what the Doctor has to say about this bump. Hopefully the scan she had on the 12th is clear at least.  Can’t believe she really had a clear head MRI report on Jan 21st and managed to grow this thing in under 3 weeks. Jen doesn’t trust the Radiation Oncologist at Sunnybrook anymore, can’t say I blame her.  Was a hectic day with our younger daughter, Kristal, stranded half way to Barrie with a frozen battery and a pooched alternator this morning, but I managed to get the truck home and fixed by 4pm. I had a battery in the shop and got lucky that the local parts store had an alternator in stock for 215 bucks. Just love these extra ""tests"" on my sanity!  We then managed to pull off a surprise 30th birthday dinner, with our other two kids and their significant others here. Jen still has it in her mind to stay in the city after the Dr tomorrow, by herself. Girls night out for her Birthday is Saturday and then her and Kristal are also supposed to go to Massey Hall next Monday for a concert, but she’s been nauseous and was just sick as I was typing this... so not sure how it’s going to play out. We’ve got to let her do what she thinks she needs to do. Wishing she had of done a trip South with Leah while I was ice fishing, instead of telling her she couldn’t afford both it and her trip to Vegas in early May for a wedding. Doubt she’ll be going to Vegas for the wedding, simply based on timing and past history of recovery.  Post to everyone today:  Well folks, I have nothing great to report, other than extreme efficiency in action the past two days.  Arrive to Mount Sinai yesterday at 1:30... no CT or MRI booked and we found out that the secretary she talked to a week earlier decided to quit last Friday, as she couldn't put up with the ""now"" attitude of Jen's new Oncologist. She should be held liable for not performing her duties, as while she told Jen she would talk to the Doc and get back to her... she didn't do either!  Anyhow... first Leah did her magic and tracked down Jen's regular nurse and told her of the bump. This quickly escalated to Jen skipping the line and probably a 3 hour wait to see the Doctor. He saw her quickly and then started pulling strings and calling in favours and while he couldn't get an MRI in his own hospital he got one for her IMMEDIATELY next door at Princess Margaret. We were back to his office within an hour and a half and by 4pm he was looking at the scan. Bump as suspected is another skull tumour, encroaching the brain as best he could see. Within minutes of telling us that he was on the phone to Sunnybrook hospital to her Radiation Oncologist. The Radiation Oncologist told him to have her in his office at Sunnybrook any time today, morning or afternoon, and he would see her immediately.  We planned to leave here at 9am this morning and had to stop at Princess Margaret to get a copy of the MRI and then across the city to Sunnybrook. Got her there about 10:45, she checked in and before even sitting down in the waiting room was called in. The R/Oncol saw her very quickly.. felt her bump and then went and looked at her MRI. Came back to tell us it's not just this bump that has grown in the last 3 to 4 weeks, there is some brain activity /compromise as well. He then called down stairs to his clinic and within 25 minutes Jen had a CT and another radiation mask formed to clamp her to the table...and a Rad schedule in her hand.  Jen starts full head / brain radiation TOMORROW for 10 sessions. Definitely not what she wants to be doing on her birthday on Friday but we are hoping that the steroids they've given her, and the energy she's showing today, that she'll be able to attend and enjoy her Saturday birthday bash with her friends."

900243,irishfield,2015-02-26 04:36:00,26272,"Nobody missed anything Bruce. The last 2 tumours.. one the size of a tennis ball... grew in less than 7 weeks after a clear scan. The ones before that in less than 16. It's just getting more aggressive as time goes on.  This isn't a typical, predictable cancer. We're dealing with Ewing's Sarcoma here. Most Doctors don't understand it, or Sarcomas in general, so I wouldn't expect many to get that it behaves nothing like typical cancers. Based on the past 72 pages though, I bet many know more about it than they ever wanted to! I certainly do, unfortunately."

I am actually afraid to open this thread as all I want to read here is she is doing just fine, This year has been a bad on as I have lost 3 close friends since the second week of January to that dreaded C word. I am a Bladder Cancer survivor as I have been clear for 4 years last December. I'm guilt actually dealing with something called survivor guilt lately  as I had 1 surgery and that was it, no Chemo, no Radiation, nothing.  I read your last post and started leaking. Look I'm not a religious person but do believe. Both my wife and I pray for your family and your beautiful young daughter. It seems are prayers are getting longer and longer unfortunately. I envy the strength both your family and you have Sir.  I know how frustrating these trips to TO must be, especially for a 5 minute consult and have to bring Jen with you considering how taxing the trip and waits can be for Jen especially. I have no idea why they have you schlep all the way to get test results, especially for a ""no change"" update. Hell I am only an hour from Hamilton and unless there is something serious from my Specialists I have them call me for test results from Diabetes to other stuff I have going on. They call me at home, sometimes just leave a message, good news or bad. I have no idea why they can't call you at home. No way in Hell I would make my daughter make that trip. My father is 88 and Mom is 85, I have POA for their health matters and I have their Docs call me for test results, as it takes 15 minutes to get Mom in a car and it gives her considerable pain to do so, it was killing me to watch her crawl into the seat a few inches at a time,I was told that the CCAA will go to the retirement residence to facilitate bloodwork. I told her many Dr's last year she just can't do it unless there is a procedure. I would put my foot down and have them call.  God bless you all up there Wayne and prayers are coming forthwith."

Jen was delayed to surgery by a double lung transplant this morning, but finally got in around 1:30pm and was all done before 3 which had us a tad worried they may not have been able to do everything. Doctor came out at 3... all went extremely well. On her lung deflation the two tumours moved away from her heart and stayed completely with the lung for easy removal. No sign of attachment to her heart. She's now being moved into a room here at TGH on the 10th floor @ 4:15. Just waiting to be allowed in to see her!"

At 3 they said she was going home (just 24 hrs after coming out of surgery).. so I started looking for someone I knew in the city that I could pawn or give my tickets to... at 4 the Nurse came in and said ""no she's not going home until tomorrow"" so I stopped looking for someone thinking we could go again. At 5pm the Doctor came in and said ""things look great... she can go home"" and at 5:30 we were on our way out the door with no time to get someone the tickets or them downtown for 7pm!    Things went well... tumours are gone and she's doing okay. A bit sore, but who wouldn't be after having three holes cut in her left side / back and her lung deflated."

891574,irishfield,2015-01-11 02:15:00,26272,"Jen doing well.. she slept on the living room couch Wednesday and Thursday nights, outside our bedroom door. Wouldn't take our bed, but didn't want me to carry her upstairs either to her own bedroom. Last night she climbed the 18 steps to the second floor and came back down this afternoon on her own, using the railing and one forearm crutch.  Here's a shot from the pre-op room, waiting to go in for her surgery on Tuesday. Her brother sure needs a hair cut... but I can't say anything as I was worse as a youngster! As for Jen, looks like she has lots of hair, but Radiation cleaned almost her entire head of hair away. Everything under the hat is bald, and she has just a perimeter of hair left. "

893411,irishfield,2015-01-22 00:15:00,26272,"Jennifer had her brain / skull / neck MRI last Friday at Sunnybrook and we saw the Radiation Oncologist this afternoon. Left home at Noon.. back here at 5pm. 2.25 hours to get to Sunnybrook in the big city... a little wait and then saw the Doctor for 3 minutes.. no maybe it was 2 ..... then 2 hours home!  ""Everything looks good, see you in 2 or 3 months""!  I certainly don't mind driving 5 hours to hear that, but Jen's body doesn't like sitting for that long... can't they just call, especially after her having to make the drive last Friday as well.  She has her Lung Surgeon check up in early February at TGH and she's coming along slow but sure from that experience and getting around pretty well. Our good friend Dr Robert Helt came over to the house last week to check up on Jen. Rob took the stitches out of her side while he was here. Rob's been a godsend the last 4+ years!  After her Lung check up at TGH in February, I presume she'll go back to regular monitoring at Mt Sinai again for her body and Sunnybrook for her head. "

I think it's more a scheduling issue for everyone to be able to make calls far enough in advance of making the trip.  She was scheduled for 2:45 today and I had a perfect view of the Doctor across the hall viewing her MRI on the screen and talking with his associate's while giving two thumbs up. Then he walked across the hall and told Jen everything looked good and he'd see her again in 2 to 3 months."

We learned on Wednesday that the ""nothing that concerns me"", from Dr. Razak last week, went out the window. The Radiologist report shows that it's not A spot in her lung, it's two lesions side by side. Consult request has been sent to PMH to do High Intensity Radiation on those spots now as well. Still waiting for the call...  Edited to add:    "
884392,irishfield,2014-12-02 23:34:00,26272,"Seems someone lost the key to shut this Roller Coaster down...  Lots has gone on in the 3 or so weeks since the last update, that contained a ""nothing that concerns me"" comment from Doctor Razak. There has been many trips to the city for imaging, consults and such that we've kept pretty much to ourselves since then, but to keep it simple....  Jennifer received her Stereotactic Radiation on her skull / brain area where the last two tumours were removed on Oct 22nd, during the week of November 17 to 21st, and everything seems to have went well with that procedure.  On the Wednesday, during that week, she got a call from Dr. Razak to tell her it wasn't ""a"" spot on her lung. The Radiologist's report came back to show it's actually two lesions side by side on the back side of her left lung, right against her heart. He was to fax a requisition request next door to Princess Margaret, so Jen could see another Oncologist over there as soon as possible.  Last week she saw Dr Brade (Radiation Oncologist) at Princess Margaret Hospital to go over what they may, or may not, do about those. Choices being surgery, 8 day or 20 day radiation... with 20 day being the most likely choice to try and minimize damage to her heart muscles / tissue from the process.  Yesterday I (We had to leave Leah at home to find her own Doctor.. Pleurisy again) took Jennifer to St. Mike's for her post op check up. Neurosurgeon (Dr. Spears) is very happy with her recovery approximately 5 weeks post op from her craniotomy / tumour removal and that the Radiation Oncologist at Sunnybrook took it from there and did his thing quickly. He was not happy to hear we were off to another hospital today for her lungs, but very reassuring to have both his cell phone number and email address if we need him on short notice ever again. Jen was also happy to get the pictures off his phone... that he took during her surgery to remove her tumours! Leah and I had seen them the day of her operation, but seeing a ""tennis ball"" in a gloved hand really makes you think about how that can all fit in an already occupied space!  Today Jennifer had her Radiation CT Simulation procedure at Princess Margaret, to pin point the target for her radiation treatments on her lung tumours. She got 4 tattoo dots on her chest for the machine to be lined up on and we were on our way home. Still don't know whether she's getting 8 or 20 days.. nor do we have a schedule, which is a little disappointing, but I'm sure we'll get a call in the next few days. No call from the Radiation Oncologist yesterday or today... and considering her CT went ahead for radiation I'd say the surgery option is no longer in play. All we do know is, that if it's 20 days, it will go right through Christmas and New Years.  Wayne and Leah "

My own daughter, at age 42, underwent a left breast mastectomy and simultaneous reconstruction in early August 2013. After her surgery, she did 6 chemo treatments and she has completed 16 of 18 Herceptin treatments. This thread has helped me immensely in dealing with the mental anguish of having a child afflicted with such an ailment. Thank you.  Kudos to Jen and to you and Leah for being so strong and so inspiring.  Jay"
884518,irishfield,2014-12-03 18:26:00,26272,"Strength is always in numbers Jay... why I share it when I can and typing it out and sending it out seems to lift the weight off the shoulders here from time to time. Wishing your daughter all the best!  ..and thanks to everyone else, including Stonefish and his generous offer last night."
887789,irishfield,2014-12-20 01:42:00,26272,"17 days since the last update and we've sat here waiting and waiting for a phone call, since Jen's CT Sim and tattooing on Dec 2nd, to tell us what her Radiation schedule is and of course wondering how fast these lung ""lesions"" are growing. She was told she would go right through Christmas with radiation and we put family ""Christmas""off 'till Jan 25th because of same. She even called numerous times to Princess Margaret's radiation department asking when... and each time they pretty much told her ""don't call us.. .we'll call you!"". We finally had enough with the waiting, and the inability to make any plans, and we did some googling and found an email address for her Radiation Oncologist, as he wasn't ""in the office"" this week.  He amazingly replied and was upfront and honest... someone dropped the ball. At their ""Met Rounds"" meeting (on Dec 1st with various Doctors) it was decided that they would put Radiation on hold until Jen saw a surgeon for a consult, especially with the two spots so close to her heart. Unfortunately.. nobody told Jen this information, or their own Radiation department for that matter with Jen having her CT Sim and tattoos put on her chest to line the machine up. And the worst, nobody had the Thoracic Surgeon make an appointment for her either!  With things kind of sorted out, on Wednesday morning we were told the best that could be done was Jan 5th for a consult and, to keep it polite, we stated categorically she wasn't waiting that long to let things grow and then have this guy say ""oh.. go ahead with radiation"". Fast forward to Wednesday afternoon and Jen suddenly had an appointment to see Dr. Waddell at Toronto General for 10am this morning. Dr. Waddell is the Head of Thoracic surgery at Toronto General. I must add... his female resident was the most versed ever on the contents of Jen's four inch thick file that we've seen to date. She recited it.. didn't even have it with her.. right back to Jen's Crohn's surgery in 2008. Dr Waddell himself shared the most information I think any Doctor, other than maybe Jay Wunder has to date. Up front.. honest and laid it all out in plain English without ""prettying"" anything up.  She has two spots about the size of the front half of the typical male thumb, as of late November's CT anyhow. They are behind her lung.. tight to her heart. They may even be attached to the outer protective layer of the heart, but he is very confident he can remove them with minimal invasive video surgery. His plan is to get the camera in first and if he sees something different than the CT is showing then Radiation may be back on, but he's hoping that on lung deflation the lesions will move away from the heart on the lung and he can easily remove them. IF that happens... it could be a short 10 minute procedure once inside. If it doesn't happen... well he and Jen will cross that bridge if necessary.  Jen is booked for a new CT January 2nd to make sure nothing much has changed and if it has then surgery may go out with the bath water as well. A 4 hour Pre-op is booked for Jan 5th and Surgery itself will be on Jan 6th, ""unless she gets bumped by a transplant patient"". Flash backs of 8 days of waiting at St. Mike's in October, while listening for Air Ambulance helicopters quickly filled the room....  Thanks for your ears... now we scramble here as it looks like Christmas might be back on for it's regularly scheduled date!  Wayne and Leah"

Today's trip a waste of time to her medical oncologist, they could have just called her on the phone to tell her she'll get a full body CT NEXT Monday instead of making her ride in a truck for 5 hours. Why it wasn't booked for today is beyond me as the appointment was arranged a week ago Friday. Conference between hospitals still tomorrow, as far as we know, and then Sunnybrook Wednesday afternoon where she'll hopefully get a direction from the radiation oncologist on everything above her shoulders. At least she'll be getting her staples out of her head if nothing else."

879418,bigbuck,2014-11-04 14:52:00,2449,Sometimes there is no making sense of how things are done. Frustrations and the like. I am 2 years in and my family doctor has yet to see anything on my file here from Credit valley. Hang in there. Wasted time is no big deal as long as there is progress. Jen is one of the strongest willed people I have ever come across and I have never met her in person.
879432,Terry,2014-11-04 17:39:00,14456,well you have become an expert at hurry up and wait
879438,irishfield,2014-11-04 18:11:00,26272,"Like I said Terry.. I can do it all day every day now, it's an unfortunate mindset you have to get yourself into or you'll have a coronary. It's Jen with only one hip to sit on, and the lack of comfort in the truck, that gets me pissed off with these Doctors. That and the fact that none seem to realize the real world situation of $100 in gas + $24 in parking (let alone a lost day) vs just making a phone call to tell you to come in next week instead."
879439,glen,2014-11-04 18:18:00,2641,Do they get paid when you go in VS not paid for call?
879440,irishfield,2014-11-04 18:19:00,26272,Doubt that's worth the $76 for them Glen... it's just lack of thought.

880260,irishfield,2014-11-11 00:45:00,26272,"VERY efficient today! Left home at 7 am.. Into Mount Sinai Hospital at 9:25.. Jen drank her Barium and was already out of the full body CT scan by the 11am that she was supposed to go in at! Went upstairs to move the Doctor consult to Tuesday... told ""closed Tuesday but I'll go see see if he can fit you in now"". We told Natalie that we had to leave by 1 at the latest, as Jen had to be at Sunnybrook no later than 2! Saw Dr. Razik and were on our way by 12:15. Razik looked over the scans himself and couldn't see ""anything that concerns me"", but of course we still need to see the official radiologist report by weeks end. There is one spot in a lung... but he says it matches the scans from back in January so suspects it's just scar tissue that he'll monitor. Considering she's had 3 lung xrays since January, that were deemed ""clear"", and he compared todays CT to January's CT it sounds like this spot should be a non-event. We then drove to Sunnybrook and grabbed some lunch in the food court and then went into the Odette Cancer Centre by 1:45. Sat for a whole 5 minutes and were taken in immediately to see Dr. Sahgal. Dr Sahgal says there's nothing new on the MRI that was taken last week... so he is just doing ""preventative"" Stereotactic Radiation on the area the two tumours were removed from about 3 weeks back. His stats say without Radiation there's an 80% chance of re-occurance and with radiation it changes things down to a 20% chance. All in all this is great news as before starting the last round of Radiation, in July 2013, Jennifer had already grown a couple new skull tumours and her brain tumour had started to grow again within the 3 weeks since surgery to remove same. After the Doctor consult Jen had her plastic mesh ""clamp down"" mask made (that holds her still on the radiation table) and the required CT that goes along with that, to mark focus points on it for the radiation technicians. Jen then picked up her appointment card and we were back in the truck by 2:55 and home at 5:05! Radiation next week, each day Monday to Friday. Gas for the truck $75 Parking today $43.75 ($20 Sinai... $23.75 Sunnybrook) Lunch (Pizza Pizza) $28.35 Todays news.. Priceless"

880272,irishfield,2014-11-11 01:19:00,26272,"Thanks guys!  Rick, I hear what you're saying... but hopefully this thread never ends.

I have friends that drive and those that unfortunately need the service. There aren't many that have those expenses in the budget or able to take the time off work. We were driving a good friend from Haldimand to London for chemo, 5 hour return plus expenses. Once he was comfortable with the whole shock to his system he chose to have him driven with the service. Prayers are with you. I am one of the lucky ones."

We could get lucky and find out the ""ball"" was a benign tumour caused by radiation, but the outer ""belt"" tumour tells us at about 99% certainty that Ewing's is still alive and well in her body unfortunately.BTW... we're all home in Penetang!

Waited all day for what was supposed to be ""noonish"" surgery again and at about 6pm, with us totally fed up, Jen's surgeon appeared on the floor just as fed up as ourselves. A gun shot wound this morning bumped some stuff and then something else bumped him out of the 4pm spot they promised him. Then it was maybe you can have the OR at 9pm..contact us at 7:30 to see if it's still available. Instead of going with the unknown certainty.... he offered to cancel all three of his scheduled morning surgeries to put Jen in that time frame. Gonna be three pissed off families come 7:45am tomorrow, but Jen is in that spot now, they'll have to deal with it!"

The 5+cm ""ball"" came out in one piece and just looks like a white tennis ball. This tumour was under her dural layer and had pushed a large (well yah 5+ cm) cavity into her brain mass. She also had a flat ""belt like"" tumour in the same area on the outside of the dura and he has sent them both as seperate samples for pathology, to see if they are both Ewing's again.... or of all things hopefully some other form of sarcoma or a radiation caused tumour. We'd be even happier to hear benign, but not much chance of that.  Thanks for the virtual ear, she's gonna have another long road to travel from here."

877924,Loonietoon,2014-10-22 23:56:00,1450,Hoping for the best out come of this ordeal Wayne... Thanks for the update and I pray it only gets better
877932,irishfield,2014-10-23 00:16:00,26272,"She looks healthy, knows what's going on and talking just fine. Her vision has returned to clear and she can read the clock on the wall outside her room, at least 30 feet away. Something she couldn't do yesterday with her blurred vision. She currently can't feel her arms, but can move her fingers. We hope this is just a similar brain reaction like the previous tumour removal last June, where her arm was paralyzed for a few days.  We saw her briefly and have left her to rest for the night"

878096,irishfield,2014-10-24 03:02:00,26272,We showed up this morning to see Jen and she'd already been moved from ICU to a regular floor room in less than 24 hours since surgery. Shortly after that she was up and to the bathroom on her own! Doesn't even have an IV hooked to her anymore and she had left surgery with no drains in. Arm function back close to the way it was pre Thanksgiving

877617,Big Cliff,2014-10-21 01:30:00,6899,I am really praying that no news is good news! Got to get some sleep but I'll be back early in the am.
877648,irishfield,2014-10-21 03:09:00,26272,I wish I did guys... and thanks for caring!  Oh.. what a week it's been!l After 7 days of waiting for surgery..... Jen into pre-op at 11:30 this morning and then wheeled into Surgery about 12:30. An hour later her Surgeon came galloping into the waiting room and motioned us over. The SENIOR Anethesiologist screwed up and somehow put a line in to her carotid artery instead of the vein in her neck. Requiring an emergency retraction of the line... Jen woken back up and surgery scrubbed until at least tomorrow. I hate to ask what else they can possible do to this women.. 
877650,lookinforwalleye,2014-10-21 03:20:00,4399,Incredible Wayne and all this from one of premier facilities in the world...makes one wonder if we are getting the best care possible...hopefully they have their crap together for tomorrow for Jen's sake!
877651,HTHM,2014-10-21 03:22:00,4082,Words cannot express how angry you must right now. You and yours have my sympathy.
877652,fishnsled,2014-10-21 03:32:00,3520,Unbelievable!!    The frustration and anger level must be through the roof.   Surely they can all get their crap together tomorrow for everyone's sake.  Positive thoughts still flowing.
877653,irishfield,2014-10-21 03:40:00,26272,"Well guys... it's been 4 years and 2 days since she was first diagnosed. I've gone from a hyper .. can't sit  still... to someone that can spend 20 hours a day sitting in a chair without a book or TV. Am I screaming on the inside sure, but doing the ""duck paddle"" instead for the sake of Jen, two other kids and a wife that is already mentally exhausted and out cold in a chair.  Tumour has grow almost a cm since last Sunday. Now about 6cm, her vision is blurred, etc. although the steroids they have her on have helped with the right side mobility."
877659,Big Cliff,2014-10-21 08:12:00,6899,"OMG Wayne, I am so sorry to hear this. I am afraid I would have lost it on them by now."
877660,spincast,2014-10-21 09:34:00,3279,"wow, that s unreal; I would be through the roof, even though I know it wouldn't change anything or help Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family Wayne. Hopefully when I log back on tonight the news is convalescence and good news."
877664,Rich Clemens,2014-10-21 10:00:00,3131,Takes a strong man to hold the composure for the rest of the family.  Disappointing would be an understatement.   Let's hope we get this right today and get it done.    Jen is quite the strong lady - hang there for her.
877674,bigbuck,2014-10-21 11:12:00,2449,"Jesus H Christ!!! At the end of the day, doctors are people who make mistakes like everyone else, the only difference is people's lives hang in the balance. Hopefully this comedy of errors ends swiftly and they get rid of the damned tumour."

876598,Rich Clemens,2014-10-14 09:55:00,3131,I thought we kicked thing thing once and for all the last time.   Hopefully this will be a quick and easy one.   Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.
876789,irishfield,2014-10-15 03:55:00,26272,"Thanks folks! Leah and I just got into Jen's Toronto apartment, hopefully for a full night and some much needed sleep. Jen saw her neuro at 8:10am, was admitted through emerg to jump the system... blood work, ECG. lung xray, etc and finally got a neuro floor room at 2pm. About 7pm she was taken to have a special CT that shows the blood vessels in her brain. At the current time, 11:45pm, still waiting for an MRI that is supposed to happen before morning. She's NPO as of midnight, so hopefully surgery proceeds tomorrow unless the consults with her Medical Oncol, Radiation Oncol and the Neuro decide another approach is needed before tumour removal. We've seen the CT from Sunday night, the tumour is perfectly round and looks like someone jammed a tennis ball into her head."
876790,2 tone z71,2014-10-15 04:03:00,1311,that's Brutal Wayne.all the best wishes to you and your family..trying times for sure

876838,irishfield,2014-10-15 16:45:00,26272,"Got her MRI at 4am... still NPO and waiting  (now 12:45pm). She may get surgery later today or tonight, but we're getting that ""ground hog day"" feeling, like her last time here, that she's not going to be able to eat anything all day... and then find she gets passed over.. repeat tomorrow. Time will tell. She's getting a tad testy with no sleep or food."

876855,bigbuck,2014-10-15 19:43:00,2449,"Ahhh CRAP!!!! Wayne, that little girl you have there is a lot tougher than us my friend. She will get through this like she did before. Just another speedbump. Take care and my thoughts and prayers are with you."
876894,Loonietoon,2014-10-16 00:42:00,1450,"Wayne, I am pulling for All of you... May The Man Up Stairs Listen..."
877072,irishfield,2014-10-17 03:55:00,26272,"Well another day of NPO and no surgery. We snuck her out to the 3 Brewers on Yonge St. for a 9pm supper to try and top her up again before midnight. Hopefully they fit her in tomorrow, or you may hear of a disturbance at St. Mike's in the news!"
877083,Cast-Away,2014-10-17 11:05:00,790,"Wayne,  I live in Newmarket and can check with the mrs. if you need a place to stay close to the city?"
877195,irishfield,2014-10-18 14:14:00,26272,"Thanks Castaway, but we're fine and thankfully aren't paying for a hotel everynight while we wait... as we have Jen's apartment about 30 minutes from the hospital.    Jen was in Que for the last OR of the night at about 9pm last night... and then a Helicopter landed on the roof at 9:10, followed by her nurse running into her room and declaring ""you can eat"" ""Sorry"" ! $%(*@$*(@$(*   Been moved up the priority list this morning from a ""C"" to a ""B"" and has been told 99% chance she'll get in within the next 8 hours. Sure hope so as her headaches are getting worse and considering this thing grew at the rate of at least a 1/2 cm per week, in the 10 weeks since a clear MRI was done July 23rd... it has most likely grown another 0.5cm in the time she's been lying here NPO all week."
877200,fishnsled,2014-10-18 14:21:00,3520,"Thanks for the update Wayne, can't imagine the stress and emotions your family is going through with these delays.  Fingers and toes crossed that it will happen today.  Positive thoughts and prayers don't stop coming your way."
877201,Jds63,2014-10-18 14:38:00,1365,Our prayers go out to Jen and your whole family to get through this setback.
877263,Cast-Away,2014-10-18 19:30:00,790,You are welcome Wayne. I hope she has a speedy recovery.
877272,bigbuck,2014-10-18 20:05:00,2449,@$?$?$?!$@!@?$?#!#?it!!! For heavens sake!! Keep us posted Wayne!!
877364,irishfield,2014-10-19 15:57:00,26272,"Everything went to hell in a handbasket about 9 pm last night.... her Surgeon is livid with the OR scheduling staff. He called me last night about 11pm, while we had Jen out to the Firkin on Yonge for some food, and read me a scathing letter to the OR scheduling staff, that ""Jen will be on the list after the first short procedure scheduled on Monday morning or she will suddenly become an ""A"" case and they'll have no choice."" So hopefully that happens... as by Monday she's going to be an A case on her own, as this thing continues to grow and her mobility lessens."
877365,Bernie,2014-10-19 15:59:00,3190,Hope it gets done soon Wayne....My heart goes out to Jen.
877367,Big Cliff,2014-10-19 16:09:00,6899,"Oh Wayne, I can't believe the nonsense Jen (and you guys) have had to put up with in this wonderful medical system we have! My heart and prayers go out to you all and we wish you all the very best!"

876046,NANUK,2014-10-09 16:17:00,797,Good for her !! She is not only fighting for herself but she is a beacon  of hope & courage for many others !
876486,irishfield,2014-10-13 06:20:00,26272,"Well I posted good news a week or so back, but here we are again. I've lost track of what ""chapter"" this is. Leah had picked Jen up in the city last Tuesday and she was very slow to get going and in the truck. Not unusual for her, but this time something just wasn't right. Over the past 3 or 4 days Jen has gone downhill quickly and lost most of the motor control of her right side. Arm especially, but her ""unattached"" leg isn't working that well either. She's had a few arm seizures over the past month or so and Sunnybrook had already upped her anti-seizure meds after the first one happened. Jen was already scheduled for an MRI on Oct 21st and a Dr consult on Oct 29th, and figured she could stick it out until those dates. With the rapid regressive nature of her mobility the past few days and the ""not a hope in hell"" of climbing stairs to bed last night (a first through all this) She decided this morning to cry Uncle and to go to the hospital. We ran her all the way back to the city, to Sunnybrook Emerg today (Sunday Oct 12th). Spent over 8 hours there, including a CT with contrast and by 9 pm tonight we learned that she has a new tumour on the left side of her brain that is causing the pressure to shut her right side down.This thing has grown in less than 2.5 months, as there was nothing there on July 23rd, and it's 5cm (2 inches) in diameter. The only thing that is remotely good about this one is that it appears to be on the outside of her brain and not in it, but they won't know for sure until they get in there. With a resident neuro consult in emerg, some phone calls to his ""boss"" and conference calls, it was decided that she will go back to St. Michaels's for surgery. Dr. Spears will do a third craniotomy on Jen, as it was felt he was the best person to do it... knowing just what he's done in the past. Jen was discharged from Sunnybrook Emerg about 9:50pm. We then spent almost 2 hours trying to fill her prescriptions on a Sunday night of a long weekend. 3 Shoppers Drug Marts. 1st one on Bayview closed 2 minutes before we arrived, and the next 2 pharmacists barely spoke English at Young and Eglington and Eglington Square. 2nd store only had 1 of 3 scripts and of course all were written on the same paper. The 3rd store questioned the script, thinking Leah was a drug dealer, and wouldn't fill them until they got a hold of the neuro that wrote it. Good luck with that, he'd only come in to see Jen specifically and had already left. Jen and I were taking bets on whether Leah would come out with drugs by midnight, without drugs by midnight or that we'd have to pick her up at the local police station for assaulting a pharmacist and post bail for her to get her out. We are back home as of 1:40AM.... THANKS Shoppers Drug Mart, you cost us almost 2 hours! We finally got food into us all, for the first time since breakfast, at 11:50 PM just before the closet Subway to the Shoppers closed. Surgery may happen as early as Tuesday coming. We are to have her back in the city and at Dr. Spears clinic for 8am Tuesday morning with no food after midnight. Suggesting he's going to do an MRI and get her in for surgery that day if possible. With St. Mike's you never know, one helicopter on the roof can bump an entire day of scheduled surgeries. Think good thoughts and we'll update when we can. Tomorrow is Thanksgiving dinner, with Kristal (our youngest) taking the apron and preparing for 9 people. Then some pumpkin carving with the 22 rifle, for a little bit of fun before what comes next."

I'm sure, compared to what she's been through, this isn't a big deal....but man, they aren't fun!  I'm hoping Carbamazepine/Tegretal is an option as opposed to Dilantin."

It looks like her blood work is good and the lungs appear clear!!!!  Back to see him again in 3 months, in early September, is the monitoring plan.  Next up, she has a Brain / Skull MRI scheduled at Sunnybrook for July 14th and is to see the Radiation Oncologist on the 16th to go over that imaging.  So Jen's back in her own apartment again as of 10pm tonight, with food and a good pepsi supply, and we're home with hopes to get back to the lake tomorrow or Thursday until her next check up in July.  Thanks for the virtual ear... and all the crossed fingers and thoughts!  Wayne and Leah"

Two check ups later and Jen's still in Toronto on her own and Leah and I are back at the lake for hopefully all of September.  Jennifer's July's brain / skull MRI shows nothing new, or of serious concern, and this past Tuesdays (Sept 2nd) chest Xray shows that her lungs are still CLEAR!!  Next head MRI is scheduled for late October, and next lung check in December"

839610,irishfield,2014-03-04 04:02:00,26272,Thanks guys... and sorry been away for 12 days enjoying a long needed break with some good lads. Her Birthday was the 27th.
840975,irishfield,2014-03-13 03:22:00,26272,"On Monday March 10 th Jen had an MRI on Brain and Skull... and today we did the 10 hour drive from hell (snow and 70K winds) to get her picked up and over to Sunnybrook (did good I was only 3 minutes late getting her there) for her Radiation Oncologist consult. We were inside for a total of 15 minutes and that included seeing the Doctor's ""fellow"" and visiting two registration desks to change some personal data.  There are no signs of any re-occurrence of the 4 skull and brain tumours that were radiated back in July of 2013 and NO new spots noted above the neck on the MRI.  Best 15 minutes in a hospital in a long long time.... and parking only cost me $4.75 !  We then fought our way back across the city and with nobody being able to get up hills I had to take it to the side streets with my truck or we'd still be sitting on Eglington Ave in Toronto.  We had a nice supper at an Italian place on Dundas West, dropped Jen at a Birthday party on Bloor and then fought our way back up the 400 and home!  She will be getting a new Lung CT and another head MRI in 3 months, with hopefully the same quick hospital visits.  What ever you folks are doing.... don't stop! She's happy and full of life once again!"

Today marks the ONE HUNDREDTH and THIRD (103rd) day of chemo that she has endured since this all started (+ mulitple surgeries, radiation and such).  On Thursday, totally out of character, her Oncologoist apparently sat in the chair across from her bed and chatted about the ""weather"" with Jen and Leah for a good 1/2 hour. He's still in awe as to how she's doing it... but she is!  Home tomorrow... if Mother Nature will allow the travel."

Just drove down that way and the roads are all cleared up now.  So anyways ... I thought I'd share something you might get a giggle out of ... against all good guidance I tried to get up to the cottage on Tuesday ... vortex schmortex ... I gots snows ... alls good to Barrie ... but at the 400/Hwy 11 cut off I see a sign flashing ""all lanes closed at Vasey Rd - in both directions"" ... not having a clue where the heck Vasey Rd is I figured it must be some road off Hwy 11 ... and carry on northbound on the 400 ... got a little slippery (ok a lot slippery) ... but I trudged on ... almost to your place ... when I figured out that Vasey Rd is in fact Hwy 12 (just before waubaushene) ... basically did a U turn and after almost 6 hrs ... ended right back home .. wifey poured me a scotch - sweetheart that she is"
830127,irishfield,2014-01-13 01:44:00,26272,"Jen's Nurse, Kim, brought her in a cake on Friday to celebrate her final week of chemo. The same nurse that also brought her in a cake when she was being discharged after her pelvic surgery in July of 2012. 95% of her nursing staff have been a blessing at both Mount Sinai and St. Michaels... and it's so great to have a few that still enjoy both doing their desired vocation and being social while doing so. We definitely know we've been inside the walls of Mount Sinai way too long.. when the cleaning staff hugs you good bye!  We are home.. and home care made it up the laneway to give Jen her Neulasta needle. Two weeks of wait and watch and then back to some sense of normal for at least 4 weeks there after before her Feb 18th check up.   "

With all highways closed up here we couldn't get to the city last night. Jen had to cab it this morning to Mount Sinai for her 8am admittance. Leah was able to get out of here by about 8am.. and using some back roads was able to get to Barrie and then onto Toronto.. arriving about 11am. I'm stuck here plowing and trying to find the phone lines I severed in the blizzard Monday night.  Jen passed her blood work, I'm told, and is in for the full week of 24/7 chemo... out on Sunday morning. Her last week of chemo for her lung spots!"

815686,irishfield,2013-10-30 04:25:00,26272,"Thanks folks... just noted myself that I started this thread 3 years ago this week and at the time figured we might be in and out of this within the year. No wonder I feel like I'm 95 years old 3+ years later, but Jen has mystified and baffled numerous Doctors, Surgeons and Oncologists with that fact that she's still going like the Eveready bunny. They'd given up a few times, through what now amounts to at least 13 tumours, but she's never said ""uncle"" so they had no right to quit on her. A good thing.. considering her original Oncologist came bounding down the 11th floor hall at noon today so happy to present her with her CT results. He had given up on her back in March.... but is fully back in the game again now with her latest response to chemotherapy and I think a big factor (in his attitude and her survival) is the fact that she's still smiling even after having her skull opened up twice."
815693,Rich Clemens,2013-10-30 09:46:00,3131,"Can't say I have ever seen such strength, drive, and determination in a person than I have seen here.  Keep on fighting Jen and being an inspiration to everyone you meet."
817505,irishfield,2013-11-08 22:49:00,26272,"Thanks again for the support... here's a couple of pictures of Jen on the Dock 104.1 morning show a few weeks ago announcing the launch of the ""Hope Lives Here"" coffee table book. The book launch is on Thursday night, in Midland, for anyone that has no where better to be.. tickets are $50 through the Georgian Bay Cancer Support Centre and the books are $65 each.  This week on the medical side I had my buddy (and personal Doctor) come by the house on Wednesday afternoon to fill out some Insurance paperwork and a blood requisition for Jen, as it was suspected her hemoglobin would be too low to do Chemo come the 18th of November. As suspected she was only 74 (down from 88 a week ago Monday)! .. so Jen was in the local hospital today for 7 hours getting a couple bags of blood and has to be back on Monday for a third. MRI on her brain, skull and neck is booked at Sunnybrook for next Tuesday night at 10:10PM, of all times.  "

One thing taking up time has been Jen's photo shoots between chemo regimes and the official book launch is coming up in November.

812353,irishfield,2013-10-12 02:23:00,26272,"Well we all got home about 6 hours ago, just in time for the home care nurses arrival to give Jen her Neulasta needle. It's not only gas prices that go up on Thanksgiving weekend..... I picked her needle up this morning, just before breaking her out of Mount Sinai Hospital, and it has gone up $38 in the last three weeks. Todays was $2898.44 for that measly 0.6ml of liquid.  Jen spent the entire week from Monday around noon until about 9 am this morning hooked up to the ""gin pole"" on her VP16 chemotherapy, that I mentioned previously was used to originally kill her pelvic bone tumour in 2010/2011. It work very well for the pelvic bone tumour and it was evident (against it) that it was working even after the very first week of treatment, so hoping it does the same trick for these lung tumours.She has now completed two, full week, sessions of this chemotherapy and thankfully made it through the two weeks following the first session without getting a fever or needing to be readmitted to hospital. She was well enough in fact that Leah took her back to Toronto a week ago Wednesday so that she had a few days on her own and then Jen spent the weekend at a cottage on Rice Lake with her Girlfriends before starting chemo on Monday.So Jen's through the 2nd full week of VP16 in an attempt to reduce her two lung tumours and nip anywhere else that this Ewing's Sarcoma is trying to make itself a home. She has had her Neulasta needle to boost her white cell growth in the days to come, to counter the chemo trying to crash them, and we go back on fever watch again for the next week or so....... and put the house back on lock down again. Hoping that this time goes as well as the last round and that she can go back to the city and have some time to herself and friends again before she starts her next full week of chemo. She is also waiting to hear when she's to be at Sunnybrook for a follow up head MRI, after her radiation treatments in July. That was supposed to be done in late September and we haven't heard from them, so Jen called the Radiation Oncologist's office on Tuesday to nudge that along for hopefully the 23/24 or 25th of October, as her Oncologist wants that ""view"" as well in time for her next appointment on October 28th.When she goes in on the 28th she'll get the routine blood work, that they need before getting a green light to do chemo, but Jen will also have another chest CT that morning to see that this chemo regime is indeed working before they'll proceed. So the 28th is the day we get that big smile her Oncologist promised us, so keep your fingers crossed! ;o)"

815567,irishfield,2013-10-29 17:25:00,26272,"Thanks folks... we've actually learned from the radiologists report this morning that she originally had 8 lung spots.. not just 2. Dealing with 4 on her right and 4 on her left. Only the 2 on her left lung were measurable and why we were only told about those... and those two are now, after 2 full week sessions of VP16, only 25% of their original size. The other 6 ""dots"" are either gone or stable / unchanged."

This one two different IV drips. Didn't finish up until 5:30pm and just got in the door. Still in good spirits, but tired and run down. She has some plans for tomorrow, but after that we'll be on fever watch as her white's crash and the house will be off limits again to visitors and such.  Hope all is well with you down in Grimsby."

804390,irishfield,2013-08-22 01:47:00,26272,"Thanks Dave and all you other ""cheerleaders"". As for composure... have your ever watched a duck CLOSELY.  Fever watch is running later into the week than her last chemo types. Yesterday morning... 38.1c.. only 0.1 away from a trip to emerg and admittance. Fortunately she came back down to around 37.5 and has stayed there since... so that is great but she's not out of the woods just yet. Generally at least a 3 day cycle.. time will tell.  So looks like heading North for us is out of the equation, to retrieve a long lost boat and airplane as well as winterizing camp. Hopefully I get there sometime before things freeze in.  Stuck at home hasn't been a total loss at least... Leah is finally getting her Master Bath after 16 years of waiting. One more day of cutting and mortaring in tile to go and then I get the fun of grouting the bugger!"

805488,Jds63,2013-08-29 12:52:00,1365, just wanted to quote what MB said ...  stay strong Jen ...
807594,irishfield,2013-09-12 23:36:00,26272,"Thanks guys!  Well she did get her chemo last Wednesday, on the 4th, and was able to spend the week on her own. Leah and I managed to make it from Toronto to Temagami direct by midnight, leaving after Jen's chemo....and grocery shop... and getting her in her apartment, but had to pull the plug going into Monday with weather coming in. In those 4.5 days we managed to pack everything up that we never got a chance to use since ""bugging out"" on June 11th, winterized everything and got the toys back home.  Jen was back to Mt Sinai for chemo yesterday and it was refused based on her chest CT from the same morning. Chemo isn't working and her lung spots are marginally larger, although within the error percentage for measurement from the last scan. Either way they are not smaller so this regime isn't working.  She is to be back on Monday to revert back to the original chemo regime that they used in 2010/2011 to destroy her pelvic bone tumour. It seemed to work very well on it, so it is hoped that it will attack her lung spots. Again this will be an inpatient treatment, going into the hospital on Monday and out on Saturday, with Leah and I back to living out of suit cases again. They'll try two rounds of this.. week of chemo.. two weeks off.. week of chemo and scan her again. Cross your fingers the Doc is smiling in Mid October!"

I was in for maintenance this week and am still recovering from the massive doses of dexamethasone (steroids). It ain't fun but we gotta do what we gotta do. They'll get Jen fixed up. Take care."
807602,irishfield,2013-09-13 00:40:00,26272,"Thanks Lew and Rick.  Bigbuck.... Jen's been on Dex since her emergency brain surgery in June.. and just when she was about to ween off of it she had her radiation treatments on her skull and brain tumours and then had to take it again for that. And just when she though she'd ate enough food... she had to take 16mg per day, for three days, for her latest chemo regime to avoid the possibility of her lungs shutting down. The only good out of that... she now weighs 108lbs vs the 78 lbs she originally went into chemo weighing in 2010. At least this time we have the peace of mind that she won't starve to death."

I am also amazed at the resilience that your daughter has, along with yourself and your family. Your energy and positive attitude are of great benefit to all of you.Your wife and you are burning that candle at both ends right now, so be careful.

807957,bigbuck,2013-09-16 14:09:00,2449,Dex is not fun stuff. I get 80mg of it in the 24hrs leading up to treatment. It keeps the possibility of reacting to the Rituximab to a minimum.

She's noticed that the forward skull bump has decreased in size since this started last Wednesday so a good sign we hope. She was squeezed in yesterday morning, at Mount Sinai, for CT's of the remainder of her body to check for any other spreading and we see her Oncologist again next Tuesday..... for what we suspect will be 8 months of weekly chemo regardless of what the scans show."

801393,irishfield,2013-08-02 04:14:00,26272,"Thanks for the thoughts guys... just back from the big smoke. Took 2 days more than I expected but Jen wanted to hit Edgefest with her VIP tickets last night, in the pouring rain, and a support group meeting at 6pm tonight at Charles and Yonge. At least I found street parking on Church and an Irish Pub on Isabella so that Leah and I could have supper while she was at her meeting for 2 hours.  Good news... as previously mentioned.. before we even got to her consult on Tuesday we already knew her forward skull tumour had reduced significantly from feel alone (even more over last weeks report) and hope that the other 3 spots have done the same from the radiation last week. The bad news... the CT's from last Monday morning show two new lesions on one of Jen's lungs.  She starts a new chemo next Wednesday. In on Wednesday morning for one chemo. Then back again the following Wednesday for that chemo plus another different chemo the same day. Back on the $2700/ needle anti infection medicine again after each chemo, so if she goes the full 8 months it will be over $60,000 worth of needles, in comparison to the $27,000 during her pelvic bone chemo. She's changing VISA cards this week to a higher ""cash back"" card to get the most out of that.  Still staying positive that she's going to kick this monster somehow... todays smiles came from seeing her physio gals (that took a shot and got her walking again) 3 day old baby!   "

786610,Twocoda,2013-05-14 23:03:00,4130,"Wayne a very effective way of getting attention is to organize as many people and pick a certain day in the future and have a tweetstorm...which means to inundate Ellens Twitter account with the same hashtag something like  this ""  @TheEllenShow #inspirationofdetermination is what you get when you meet #JenOshea and learn of her #victoryovercancer This #amazingstory ""  you can attach her videos and pics if you choose which will draw attention to the show producers and Ellen to do more research on Jen...could even throw in a link to this site to see how it has affected Jens family and the support they have received from total strangers  (such as myself) ....  For the record ..i have tweeted that little eg to Ellen so use those hashtags and if everyone uses them ...they will ""trend"" and the rest of the world that follows Ellen will get her story as well...hence creating more people to push for Jen to be on the show....this method has successfully forced politicians to address issues so i cant see why it couldnt be used for something actually worthwhile....

787649,bassassin,2013-05-21 03:51:00,152,Hey Wayne your daughter is all over the friggin net doing her flexible leg trick!!!  http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/83306656/  ebaumsworld is one of the biggest sites on the net for cool videos etc... she is on numerous other sites too!!! pretty awesome!  She is being seen by the WHOLE FRIGGIN WORLD!!! Considering her journey thus far she deserves it!
793257,irishfield,2013-06-18 03:42:00,26272,"Well Jennifer is now famous around the world (currently at 1,005,700 views and climbing on her ""leg trick"" video) and has even been interviewed via phone from the Sydney Australia Morning Herald... the UK times.. Huffington Post in Toronto and others. She has a handler and licencing agreements in place to be on some TV shows as well. She was supposed to be on Breakfast Television in Toronto last week and that's the good news.......  The bad news....... she had to cancel that for now as Jen had a few seizures on Tuesday. Some just her right arm flinching and hand clinching uncontrolled to the point she put her fingernails thru her hand....and a few Grand Mals as well. We got the call up North, at camp, at 7pm Tuesday night and were in Toronto by 2am to join Jen and her Girlfriends at St. Michaels Hospital. CT.. MRI and many other tests done within a couple of hours. Helps that she has her Neuro's cell phone number! On Thursday she had surgery to remove about a 4cm tumour from her brain, directly below where the skull tumour was and it was putting pressure on her motary area of her brain that runs her R arm and hand (that currently aren't working but slowly coming back on line). This tumour grew in exactly 4 months. They removed it as best they could without carving into her brain, but ""roots"" have been left behind. Being the bugger Ewing's is it will regrow again just like picking mushrooms from a log. Radiation consultation on Monday coming at Sunnybrook and she goes from there. Discharged today and we are home...  Just to add misery to the equation.. my truck was hit by a drunk driver (female) last night while parked outside her apartment and caught on fire. Had to beg a ride home for the three of us this afternoon and now also have to deal with the loss of my truck in the midst of needing to get her here and there, as well as me needing to get North and look after a bunch of stuff we left precariously on Tuesday night."

I was told cancer is a journey in life for both the person going through it and the family from the get go. Your family's journey continues with a bunch of twists and turns. Stay strong and Jen will get through it. Let me know if you guys need a lift or anything. I'm off till August so a drive up to Penetang will be kinda nice to beat the boredom."

797786,irishfield,2013-07-12 15:37:00,26272,"Jen's all set up for the latest state of the art high intensity localized (within 0.5mm of target)radiation starting Wednesday, for 5 days. Tuesday she had a new MRI and Wednesday between 9am and 10:55 she saw 3 doctors and 3 specialists without leaving the room we were in (should always happen that way!)... and had her final consult... overview... contrast CT and a plastic mesh moulded over her head and shoulders that will clip her to the table in place. The definitely not so great news... the MRI shows what we expected, that the ""removed"" brain tumour has already started growing again in only 26 days...as well as she has a new skull tumour forward of the original one at the hair line / forehead and if that isn't enough she also has a small one at the back by her neck. They're going to hit them all each day with radiation and we're waiting to find out on Tuesday if there is any chemo she's allowed from here out. Scary part is her MRI from 28 days previous didn't show these two new tumours at all."

770690,irishfield,2013-02-28 01:13:00,26272,"Saw the Oncologist yesterday, who is still waiting for clear answers from pathology and the Neuro as to what they really removed. Based on what he actually does know, there will be no radiation or follow up chemo since there is nothing specific to treat. At this point she's on a 3 month watch cycle... so she sees him next in May unless he calls her to say otherwise. Not quite the 28th Birthday present she was looking for, but still smiling!   "

757347,irishfield,2013-01-08 00:22:00,26272,"Passed her blood work today.. so we're thru day one of chemo with four days to go, of what hopefully will be Jen's last ever week of chemo! Surgery date yet unknown, but we should know by weeks end."
757350,Rich Clemens,2013-01-08 00:27:00,3131,All our best folks.
757352,kickingfrog,2013-01-08 00:32:00,8333,"There is a whole gang misfits here pulling for her, and your whole family Wayne."
757402,Nipfisher,2013-01-08 02:19:00,2449,Great news.
757438,bigbuck,2013-01-08 04:20:00,2449,There's some good news. Let's hope that she is done with this soon.
759031,irishfield,2013-01-14 03:53:00,26272,"Jennifer did her last full week of chemo from Monday Jan 7th to Friday 11th. Hopefully the last she'll ever see!Based on his reactions... I think her Oncologist is amazed more than anyone in all of this.. I guess he picked the right chemotherapy drugs, as the tumour has shrunk out of sight and it's impossible to find the spot physically anymore. I'm not sure he actually expected this outcome, but based on the last MRI (waiting for a new one) the drugs have worked and effectively started killing this bone tumour (the best the radiologist can see in the images) after chemo week #3.We were promised that we'd be told a surgery date when we came in on Monday, but some things just get old and predictable... and her Oncologist said "" I guess I should get a hold of your surgeon"" instead on Monday AM. Exactly what he said he was going to do three weeks prior. So we have no idea when surgery is.. nor can any of us make any plans because of same.We are waiting for a call this week from the neurosurgeon's secretary for an appointment in the following week or so.. and the best we have so far is surgery will be about two weeks after that appointment. Hopefully we'll learn both dates at the same time when the call comes, but I imagine it will be an appointment to see the neuro again and then at that time she'll get her date for surgery to remove the effected skull bone area. Leaves us all handcuffed and sitting on pins and needles, but it is what it is.  Picture of Leah, Jen and I as her last chemo bag beeped out... "
759032,Christopheraaron,2013-01-14 04:06:00,3525,Nice! With any luck this fight will soon come to a close. Good luck with the next trip!
759053,spincast,2013-01-14 10:30:00,3279,awesome Wayne.   That sounds like the best possible outcome after all you guys went through in the last 18 months.    Here's hoping this dragon is slayed once and for all and you guys can get back on with living a (as close as you can with no hip bone) normal life.
760669,T Dot,2013-01-19 18:12:00,18,"read the first and last pages.  im new here, but this is very touching.  hope all is well, and stay strong!"
760751,irishfield,2013-01-20 00:36:00,26272,"Thanks T Dot..  welcome to the madness we call OFC ! First and last page won't give you much of what she's been through, but when you get a a few hours... read the filler in between, where she lost her r pelvic bone... learned to walk again and then was diagnosed with a Ewing's tumour on her skull. Finally snagged an MRI date... so we're back in the city Monday for that and a neuro appointment on Tuesday. Then we'll hopefully learn when surgery is to remove the effected skull bone."
760801,tomO,2013-01-20 02:05:00,363,good luck to you all.
761550,mattybculp,2013-01-22 17:28:00,388,wow what determination ! very inspiring. you must be so proud!

761738,irishfield,2013-01-23 03:12:00,26272,Thanks guys!  Two days pretty much wasted... she faught to get the MRI yesterday and it shows GREAT progress.. but yesterday and today pretty much all for naught ! About all we learned today..... surgery will be a Thursday and he got her to fill out a Request for an MRI and CT at St. Mike's so they can coordinate it with their surgical plotting equipment. Could they not have just done yesterdays MRI there instead of at Mt. Sinai to save some time and radiating??  So now we wait again... for the new scan dates and from there we'll learn a surgery date. They screw around too long she'll be doing chemo again...
761805,motv8tr,2013-01-23 13:48:00,2587,"It's very frustrating how they do things, and makes one wonder how they managed to get as far as they have in battling cancer..,I hope for Jens sake they figure the schedule out sooner than later to do the surgery before too long...  I am happy to see Jen is doing so well in this fight.. Maureen"
763034,irishfield,2013-01-28 01:00:00,26272,"On the fast track... had her MRI this morning.  CT scan, plastic surgeon appointment and pre-op appointments all combined tomorrow between 10 and 2 ....thanks to a Neuro's secretary with a heart !!!!  Surgery to remove the effected skull bone and any effected surroundings on Thursday.  Cross what ever you have for her when you get up that morning! Gonna be another long day....  "

763070,bigbuck,2013-01-28 03:00:00,2449,At least now you know when and it is quick. I hope and pray that the surgery goes well for Jen.
751951,irishfield,2012-12-15 04:43:00,26272,"  Thanks Roger and everyone else that keeps checking in here.  Jen went back to her apartment on Wednesday afternoon... to get an entire 4 days and 3 nights (out of the last 3 weeks)without her parents staring at her.. and hopefully some friend visit time. We're back to the city Sunday night.. for full week #5 of chemo for this skull tumour.. and then home again on Friday night the 21st. Deja vu all over again.. better not be sitting in GBH on Christmas eve this time around..  As asked previously... please share Jen's Montage video where ever you can, heck.. go click it from time to time when you think that sniffle is something to whine about!"
751952,Tayzak15,2012-12-15 05:02:00,318,"I know I'm new on here and don't really know anyone yet on here, but that video is unbelievable! After seeing that x-ray at the beginning I wouldn't even think it would be possible to walk again. That's amazing the progress she has made. I wish your daughter and your family the best!"
751956,irishfield,2012-12-15 05:19:00,26272,"  Thanks Tayzak... it's not only you, her Oncologist doesn't understand how she can walk either.. but her sure does brag that she can!"
751961,Tayzak15,2012-12-15 05:41:00,318," Im curious and its fine if you dont want to answer, where her pelvic bone is missing there is there still lots of pain or pressure pain where the pelvic bone is gone? , since the femur bone doesn't seen to be attached to anything and just in flesh there? I just can't imagine being able to walk without that bone, its incredible that she is."
751964,irishfield,2012-12-15 06:02:00,26272,"  As you can see if you stop the video there.. everything is gone.. pelvic, pubic and a good part of her sacrum in an attempt to get clear margins from the bone sarcoma on the right side. Nothing will ever be replaced as there's no hard bone left to bolt anything to. Yes, her femur ball is just floating in tissue and muscle. She hasn't taken a pain killer for it since day 12 after surgery... although she's gonna have issues to counter with spinal curvature over time and be a chiros best $ friend. They told her she'd be in bed in the hospital for at least 6 weeks, possibly 6 months... she was out of there on day 18!"
751965,Tayzak15,2012-12-15 06:11:00,318," Thats incredible, good for her!, just looking at that x-ray and imagine walking i can feel the pain. For her to actually go through it and continue fighting is astonishing!"
751970,irishfield,2012-12-15 06:28:00,26272,Physio 5 to 6 times per WEEK since last October (Sun Life hates her ass.. totally covered to the tune of over 25 grand for Physio and about the same for anti infection needles during her first chemo sessions). Walking sure didn't come easy... now to take care of this Ewing's tumour on her skull.
751972,Tayzak15,2012-12-15 06:50:00,318," Yes. Best of luck! With the attitude she seems to have, nothings going to stop her! I'm confident she will make a full recovery. Stories like these make me thankful for my health. I'm only 21 years old, but it certainly humbles me reading stuff like this. It makes you realize no matter what your age, you're not invincible to disease. Really makes me appreciate what I have a lot more."
752026,ehg,2012-12-15 16:32:00,2666,"Following this thread really helps me fight against physical disability.  Jen's heart, will and mental strength is more than incredible."

Jen wants it to go viral... end goal she really wants to get on the Ellen show to share the inspiration!  Just in the door after another full week of chemo. Monday's MRI showed the tumour on her skull has reacted / shrunk / changed shape which are all good signs. Two more full weeks of chemo at minimum, one starting Dec 17th and the next early in January. Then we'll see how they proceed from there. Wayne"

742455,irishfield,2012-11-07 02:37:00,26272,"Through day 2 of chemo this week, with 3 more days to go for this round. Today almost didn't happen with Jen discovering she had an infected tooth last night. Reported it this morning before starting chemo...which then stopped the train in it's tracks, while they tried to find her Oncologist. He doesn't usually come into Mt Sinai until after 1pm on Tuesdays as he has clinic at another local hospital in the morning. He showed at 11am to inspect, write a script for a type of "" 'cillan"".. can't remember which one.. and give the green light to continue chemo and stay on schedule while I ran to fill the antibiotic script.  Yesterday he found himself amazed once again... and can't feel any sign of the tumour anymore. Ordered an MRI before next visit to see how close we're getting to returning it to the bone so it can be removed to clear margins."

743847,irishfield,2012-11-14 01:10:00,26272,"Thanks folks! The tooth infection came back about 8 hours after taking her last Amoxicillian on Saturday, while Leah and I were up in the CN tower having a 60th Birthday party for my older sister. So with her Oncol gone to Czechoslovakia... and my buddy/Dr gone to Holland for Remembrance day celebrations, we had to take her into Emerg on Sunday night for an incision/ drain and more drugs. Hoping like hell that the infection goes away before her white cell count bottoms, but it doesn't look like it's gonna happen. Bad feeling we'll have her back in hospital before the weeks out."

Have her see a dentist, maybe the tooth needs to be pulled, better that than recurring infections which are no good at this point as we know. You just do your damndest to keep her spirits up. She is one heck of a fighter."
743960,irishfield,2012-11-14 15:30:00,26272,You're not allowed to have dental surgery or even cleanings while doing chemo... at least what we were told during the first round. (and she did see a dentist for a check on this and xrays on Monday)  How you making out bigbuck?
743963,limeyangler,2012-11-14 15:36:00,5204,Not great news...man that sucks.  Sure helps put my 'stresses' in perspective though.  best wishes to you all.
744006,bigbuck,2012-11-14 18:24:00,2449,"So far so good. My white blood cell count is down in a big way so I'm heading in the right direction. One of the drugs that is on my chemo regimen causes an adverse reaction (I basically go into convulsions that takes a healthy shot of demerol to stop). My haematologist saw the reaction this time and took the drug off the regimen. Nobody ever said that this journey is in a straight line so we deal with things that come along. Hopefully for Jen, this infection clears up quickly. Good luck."

728982,Harrison,2012-09-11 10:24:00,2202, My exact thoughts.  Sorry to hear she has to put the gloves on for another round.
728990,Live2fish85,2012-09-11 11:25:00,1633,All the best to your family and yourself Wayne. Jen can do it again. Her attitude is amazing from the videos I have seen and from what you have told us. Let see her beat it again.  I will be thinking of her and praying she beats this again.
729013,misfish,2012-09-11 13:23:00,29133,Sorry to hear this Wayne. Jen is always in our prayers.
729155,motv8tr,2012-09-11 21:28:00,2587,"Well now that just sucks, there are no other words, other than, I'm cheering all of you on...Jen has shown she has the strength and determination like no other...  Maureen"
729446,MJL,2012-09-13 00:02:00,2427,Jen's got a lot more fuel in the tank for the next round...I know it  Sending all the positive thoughts your way...Jen's my hero
729493,FisherJuli,2012-09-13 02:26:00,125,"Your daughter is a fighter, and I think it goes without saying how admirable her strength to fight and persevere is... It saddens me to see people that truly deserve a different path to get the potholed and bumpy road, but at the same time it makes me proud to see how strong and determined my fellow human beings can be. I wish your family all the best of positive outcomes."
729508,irishfield,2012-09-13 03:23:00,26272,"Thanks for the well wishes folks!  Extremely long day for everyone today with Oncol running 5 hours behind.... They are trying to get a new portacath (IV port for the chemo) into her chest by next Wednesday latest (they removed the old one about a month ago as it wasn't gonna be needed anymore! ).. then chemo will start again on the 24th of Sept if all goes according to plan. Monday to Friday again.. every three weeks, but this time as an outpatient each day instead of spending the nights in the hospital (we forgot to ask how many sessions.. or were afraid to, the days been a blur). Good and bad to it.. good is she has her own apartment 20 minutes from the hospital and her own bed's a better place, bad is we used it to crash last time while she was in all week long and it wasn't a big deal with all 3 of us crammed in for the one night before chemo. It's only a bachelor pad, so we may have to find a small apartment for ourselves or blow $600 to $700 each week on a hotel + the same in meals out. The apartment for a full month vs just a week of hotel would be about equal. More crap to figure out....and yes I'm considering the numerous offers of accoms from members and friends. Logistics of location, driving time and parking just add to the ""figuring"" part!"
729512,fishnsled,2012-09-13 04:02:00,3520,Thanks for the update Wayne. Lots of figuring to be done but at least they have the ball rolling. Positive thoughts and prayers sent your way. Let me know if there is anything I can do.
729714,bucktail,2012-09-14 02:41:00,1857,Godspeed and good thoughts for you and the family Wayne. Always thinkng about you and the family.  I have a really good feel about this and wish I could give that to you and her!!!    darren

732546,irishfield,2012-09-25 20:14:00,26272,Thanks folks and much appreciated G-Man  2 Days of chemo in the books.. and a new portacath installed yesterday afternoon as well. Told at this point that she'll be doing a minimum of 6 full week sessions of chemo (every 3 weeks again) and we'll see where she's at and what to do at that point.
732579,misfish,2012-09-25 22:14:00,29133,"These events would make one think,does he care? What are his plans for this young beautiful lady? In my opinion he does.He is testing this young lady for a reason. What reason,only he knows. Her determination show many of us,she is a fighter,and is one that can hold her head high,and say,I,M STILL HERE,YOU CANT BEAT ME.  We all pray for JEN AND HER FAMILY,and we all,are on YOUR TEAM."
733268,irishfield,2012-09-28 17:07:00,26272,"Thanks B... 5 Days of chemo in the books, back again to do it again on Oct 15th. Full weeks, every time, this time. We're all headed home so Jen can be monitored as no idea how next week will go with this round being a totally different chemotherapy regime."
733272,graftongal,2012-09-28 17:45:00,145,Wishing your family all the best through this Wayne. This story makes my ride participation all the more worthwhile!!!

733430,bigbuck,2012-09-29 15:12:00,2449,"Wayne, you keep on trucking. I got my own bad news this week. I've got some form of leukemia or lymphoma and am now waiting for my final diagnosis. My heart goes out to all those dealing with this horrible disease. Stay strong, stay positive and stay focussed on getting better. Those were the words of one of my doctors."
733437,irishfield,2012-09-29 16:20:00,26272,Sorry to hear that bigbuck... hopefully me sharing Jen's fight has given some insperation for yours that's to come. What hosptial are you working with?.. maybe we can get together to chat.
733446,bigbuck,2012-09-29 17:31:00,2449,"Wayne, I've been following jen's fight from the get go and it has truly been inspirational. She is a beacon of hope to those who think they can't fight any longer. As for myself, I remain positive and have to hurry up and wait for the results from my bone marrow biopsy which will hammer down exactly what I have and then a treatment plan can be put together. I was diagnosed at Oakville Trafalgar and my treatment should be at Credit Valley. A trip downtown for me isn't too big a deal. I've put my life on hold and distractions are welcome. I will let you know. You can hoist a pint and I'll have an ice cold coke. Your generosity and willingness to help around this board is legendary. Karma WILL show you some love. Keep your head up."

735340,irishfield,2012-10-09 03:39:00,26272,"Well this has been a miserable week....Jen even missed her girlfriends stagget on Saturday night, that she was so looking forward to. Just knew she didn't have the energy to get to the city, let alone attend. Been a long week of trying to get her to eat.. trying to keep her off the can... and trying to get her to do some walking around. All things that didn't happen.... and Wed/Thur/Friday/Saturday all days of fever watch bouncing back and forth over the ""magic"" 38.2C that means a trip to the hospital if she stays there for more than an hour. That has finally stopped, thank God, and she finally ate a fair portion tonight. Hopefully the rest of this week goes a lot better... so she can get some strength back to start another full week of chemo on the 15th. The good part, her head has stopped hurting... and she's fairly certain the tumour has shrunk."
735341,limeyangler,2012-10-09 03:48:00,5204,WOW...indeed a lousy week for you all. But good news she thinks the thing has shrunk.  Best wishes and thoughts to you all as always.

I went 4 years between bouts, (I'm now cancer-free for almost 9 years) and by that time I'd let my guard down a bit too!

Jen had her one year, since surgery, check up today... blood work, Xray and CT scans still showing she is clear of Cancer. Her showing the Oncologist, Surgeon and all their interns that she could walk, and a few other ""parlor tricks"", had them standing there with their mouths hanging open. A couple interns ran to fight over the computer to look at her Xray in disbelief... that it could even be possible!  Wish I had more time to upload some video I took today, but I hope to be back ""on the dock"" before dark tomorrow.  And YES Terry she did climb the Temagami Fire Tower on Saturday morning... WITHOUT using even a cane or taking anyone's hand.  Picture at the top says it all !  "

724637,irishfield,2012-08-23 23:20:00,26272,"Well as the saying goes... all good things come to an end at some point!  A year of extremely hard work, to reprogram her brain, leg and muscles to work together and do things that no Doctor has seen before, after a brutal 7 months of Chemo before surgery and now...  Jen has a bone tumour on her skull approximately 7cm x 6 cm that's about 1cm deep. We are praying it isn't Ewing's again and that it's something new this round.. if you can believe that.  Sounds odd... but we are praying that it's any other cancer than Ewing's Sarcoma... that way the tumour can be removed now, although her Oncologist is fairly certain that it is Ewing's based on the tumour configuration (but hopes like hell he's wrong) If it Ewing's it has to be killed with chemo before it's touched (the same as her pelvic bone tumour was) which will mean, most likely, another 10 sessions of full week long chemotherapy on a 3 week cycle. She saw a neuro surgeon again this morning and her biopsy is on Monday am to make room to get her in for a full body bone scan tomorrow at 8am ........ just to make sure this beast isn't anywhere else in her body. They'll performed the biopsy Monday and then we bite our nails and wait for the results for at least 10 days.  Nothing really needs to be said... just looking for more positive thoughts all around to get her through another bump in the road! She's keeping her head up and even went straight from the neuro-surgeon appointment to work this morning, as ""someone needs to get the new Maple Leaf Gardens Athletic department ready to go"" !

674316,Tarzan's Jane,2012-03-08 22:43:00,1183,"Simple superb!  Wonderful to see you looking so great Jen.  I went and picked up a DVD made by one of the trainers on the TV program ""The Biggest Loser"".   The workout was all of 20 minutes (level 1) consisted of cardio, strength and abs.  It was brutal...I had difficulty walking for the next few days...even lowering myself to sit on the potty was painful.  I absolutely hate every second of it....haven't done jumping jacks since highschool....the only part I like is the ""cooling down"".  But I'll stick to it....if you can do all that, I can certainly ""feel the burn"" for 20 minutes a day.  Anyhow...I just wanted to say hello and tell you how excited I am for you.  Thanks for sharing Jen's story Wayne. I'll just give you an update on my Pops.  He passed away February 18, 2012.  I was by his side and I was just so relieved for him when he finally left.  Two days later, he came to me in my dream and asked me to not speak about his final hour anymore.  He went on to say that his life was more than that last 60 minutes.  And so I will honour his request and I have much comfort knowing he is home and that I will see him again.  Although I will say this...the night before he passed....he told the nurse, ""I've been seeing people that I haven't seen in a long time.""  Then he asks the nurse ""Am I still here?""  (He thought he had already passed.)  Take care and God Bless"
674361,Remo,2012-03-09 00:40:00,33,"Awesome stuff Wayne, its wonderful to see her progress."
674379,irishfield,2012-03-09 00:58:00,26272,"Thanks guys! .. and Nancy, not glad about the end result.. but certainly glad his suffering is over and he's moved on. Like my Mother put on my father's tombstone ""There are better days ahead"". Always scratched my head on that one, but now that my mother's dates and my sister's dates have been added to that very stone.. I think I have it figured out!"

680964,Grimace,2012-03-28 12:57:00,2020,It must have been absolutely heartbreaking watching your daughter lose strength while getting sick and it must be an equally fulfilling feeling watching her gain strength again.  We use our smiles to conceal our feelings and it's funny because those smiles are often a dead giveaway.  It must be nice to see that your daughter's nervous smiles that were meant to comfort everyone have been replaced with smiles that have a bit of grit in them knowing that nothing will hold her back.  I imagine this is still a very frustrating process for her but at least she is on the way up.  It certainly seems that the girl has the right attitude and a great support system around her.

Irishfield, I know I don't have to tell you this, but your daughter is an incredibly strong woman.  Thank you for sharing your family's experiences with us (the good and the bad). Your daughter's story, spoken through your words, has probably changed more lives (for the better) than you might ever be aware of.  If I could say anything to Jen, I would reiterate Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous words:  ""What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you""  May your future hold nothing but good Karma,  Steve"

My wife has been diagnosed with chrones, 6 years ago ...aweful disease.  Not at all am I trying to campare, saying that I remember the gloom assioated with just that disease alone... Took the wind out of my sails.  The fact that your daughter and family fought not only that, but the cancer and all other stuff assioted with that.  Hats off to you and yours.  You can call it Karma or what you wan't I was told by a friend once smile at the world and the world will smile back at you!!!!!!   I have  never heard of any one smiling at the world with cancer....until today thanks Jen, I will share your story with my 8 year old daughter tonight.   You and yours will be in our prayers aswell. keep up the positive attitude.  I had a crappy day at work today......It doesnt matter. thanks"

As for ""smiling at the world"".. lots of reasons for it, even though we did get ridiculed by a few families in the Sarcoma unit that felt ""there was nothing to laugh about"". Well we fooled them...  I totally changed my attitude on life when I was turning 30.. I told my Mother ""I was gonna enjoy the next 30 years as I was half way there"".. with  my father dying from Cancer at the age of 59. She slapped me for that statement.... but I carried on with that tact. I guess it rubbed off on the kids, as they live for today and enjoy tomorrow if it comes.  Wayne"

Jen has a blog she has been writing since getting out of surgery, that will no doubt develop further with time. Leah is writting a book about dealing with a rare sarcoma, from a parents prospective...

655977,irishfield,2012-01-12 18:43:00,26272," Definitely Dave. Jen stays in touch with the social worker, on the Sarcoma unit floor in Sinai, for just such reasons. Leah and I... as parents.. had nobody in a similar situation that was willing to  ""welcome"" us into this nightmare and share with us how to proceed. As time progressed we became the ""go to"" people on the sarcoma unit floor for the new parents coming in."
656099,Grimace,2012-01-13 00:30:00,2020," That is very good to hear.  When I think of young people with cancer I try to imagine but can not begin to fathom all the feelings that a journey like this would bring to a family.  The elation of small victories to be crushed by small defeats, the joy of hope and darkness of helplessness.  The fear.  The small hurdles that were suppose to be easy ending in failure only to surpass milestones months earlier than expected.  Crying until there are no more tears.  Expecting yet another nurse to come through the door who is jaded and desensitized to the pain of it all, only to get a wonderful person who restores your sense of humanity.  I guess what I am trying to say is it is very hard for all of us to understand fully the fact that your family and many families in your position in these hospitals all over the place are getting a lifetime's worth of humanity in a span from a few months to a few years. That is quite a dose. Thanks for sharing a drop of it with us.  Although many of us can not imagine what it was like, we can now think about it with a little more clarity.  My friend that I use to work with had a very young family member in the cancer ward at sick kid's.  The next day at work after one of his visits he would tell us about how mentally excruciating it was to see all those little kids in there and the parents.  The little fella didn't make it.  Sometimes I think about when he told me.  A kid I had never met.  We were devastated and we didn't even know him.  This is precisely why stories like your daughters need to be told.  It is awesome that she is.  I guess after all of this, you guys wouldn't have expected anything less of her."
657723,irishfield,2012-01-18 15:41:00,26272,"6 month post op check up yesterday. A long miserable day with Xray machines down, surgeon 2 hours behind to see her and the oncologist even leaving before he saw Jen..leaving a flunky behind to update her progress.  None of that mattered by 7pm... with her Chest CT scan and pelvic Xrays showing ""clear"".. and kidney & liver functions still normal after all that high dose chemo.  The drive home after midnight was another story."

She's still got a long way to go, but it's amazing what she's currently doing without any mechanical connection to that leg. She is currently WELL beyond, with leg function, any of the others we know that have had this operation long before her."

I like to believe there is a reason good people are dealt difficult cards when others more deserving never turn one up! One day, it will all make sense! Karma, as you say. In the meantime, Jen is clearly going to win her battles and live a normal, fulfilling life...because she has fought so hard for what others take for granted!  And one day there will finally be the moment...the moment when it makes sense why she had to suffer through all this. And hopefully it will be a GOOD moment so it can mean enough to erase the pain and replace it with accomplishment.  But regardless of all that, she is beautiful...a fighter...and destined to outlive everyone else!  Thank you for taking the close friends you know well here, and the complete strangers like myself on this incredible journey of hope! I wish Jen and your family all the very best in the days to come!"
626277,irishfield,2011-09-29 17:09:00,26272,Thanks Mircacon.. some wonderful words there.  We actually lucked out and produced two that the boys are kept well aware that I have guns !

628055,irishfield,2011-10-05 16:13:00,26272,"Jen had 3 CT's yesterday at 8am.. chest, intestinal and pelvic. Saw both her surgeon and oncologist in the afternoon and her CT's are absolutely clean... as are her blood tests. She showed both (actually 5) Doctors that she can put her full weight on the unattached leg, at only 3 months out, so they're already talking about her shoe lift fitting for the ""miracle child"". WHEN she walks... I think she'll be on the talk show circuit with her surgeon !   Her Oncologist still doesn't even begin to understand how the whole thing is possible, but he has seen her progress with his own two eyes and he's as amazed as anyone else.  I did some retrofitting to her apartment, removed some automatic door closers from her front storm door so she can get her main door unlocked without fighting the storm door. Installed some hooks for things and a flip down door stop on her laundry room door that has an autocloser. This way she can use her walker going thru, carrying her clothes on the walker seat. Drilled a hole in the stop and attached a cord up to the door knob so she can retract the door stop when done.  Her cupboards and fridge are full of groceries and she's on her own ! Scary at this end, and probably at hers as well... but a stage that has to be tested and conquered by all of us.  Here she is a couple days before going home, riding the ballbike that we'd bought hoping the ball would be more comfortable for her to sit on and get exercise/leg strengthening. Left leg is doing the turning and the right is along for the ride about 80% right now, but she's getting better and the leg is getting stronger. She can drive Leah's truck now... ALL with her right leg/foot. And with Leah's truck you have to lift your leg over to the brake pedal...simple heel pivot doesn't work. "
628060,Bernie,2011-10-05 16:24:00,3190,She is an incredible young lady Wayne. You must be proud of her determination and strength.
628062,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-05 16:32:00,4399,That`s great news Wayne!!!  Perhaps she should consider doing some talking I am sure she would be great inspiration and a marvelous spokes women!!!

Hoping now that she's back in the city and close to her good friends that it will be even more reason for her to spark a flame at working to get closer to walking again.  So yesterday was a day of wondering what to do for Leah and I, with Jennifer off our couch and back in the city. Then this morning we got slapped back to reality of how quick things can change. I'd mentioned a couple posts ago about Jen's 4 hours wait to see the Dr's back on Sept 6th as they were giving other families bad news. One of them was Kayla  and she passed away 3 days later.  http://ontario.announcements.ca.msn.com/guelphmercury/profile/219638--mccormick-kayla-marie-chartier"

My condolences to  her family and Jen, and you and Leah too as I am sure you guys developed a great bond over the last year. Your signature sums it up  - faced that possibility 20 years ago. I was lucky."

I've been pre-occupied with my own family heartache but when OFC comes into mind I think of Jen and the relief I feel for all of you.  Just a little update on my Pops.  He is terminal.  The morphine is helping....for now.  And the anti-depressants, I believe, are helping him to cope.  I'm not too sure though as I  have fears about what's to come.  I can only ask God to please have mercy on him.  But hearing and see Jen doing so well is super news!  God Bless."

We were told the same day that nothing could be done and ""if you fight this war the end will be the same."" An amazing Dr helped us out (Dr Vincent Miada Google him) She didn't suffer at all and after the life she had we didn't want to see her suffer. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst."

Her biggest issue right now is she's having some issues with pain/burning in her right foot the last few days. We figure it's the nerve endings that got cut at her hip trying to repair themselves.  She's still on track to attending beerfest with her friends on the weekend and then we're hoping she's up for heading North with us to enjoy the lake. If not, we'll have to make do with the pool and I'll be hitting GBay for Muskie instead."

Hot miserable day... she made it from 1 until 5:40 when she called for pick up suffering from a little heat exhaustion. All in all Jen is doing well, other than she's having issues with her right foot feeling like it's burning all the time. Causing her a lot of restless nights and days, with nothing seeming to help it. I believe they're phantom pains from nerves cut in her hip. Her surgeon called in a script today to our local pharm and Leah's off to pick it up... sure hope it works at killing the nerve ending issues. "

621323,irishfield,2011-09-14 02:21:00,26272,"Had her 2 month post op check up last Tuesday. Lung and pelvic x-rays are clear, thank God, and she's booked for MRI/CT's in October. The young lad noted a few pages back with the same right pelvic Ewing's, that Jen bought toys for his 18th, has 14 spots on his lungs now.   and he isn't even done the chemo sessions for the pelvic bone.  Surgeon pulled Jen's leg a ways out.. and let the muscles pull it back in. He's happy and she's now allowed to start putting weight on the leg and to do physio.  One freaky x-ray I'll tell you with that femur ball all alone in tissue land with no mates to play with!"
621328,mercman,2011-09-14 02:39:00,7054,"Great news about Jen, Wayne .Sad about the young lad though. Thanks for the update. I was thinking about you guys earlier today."
621419,bigbuck,2011-09-14 13:16:00,2449,"Good to hear that Jen is doing great!!! As for the young lad you mentioned, I hope he keeps on fighting."
626109,irishfield,2011-09-29 03:10:00,26272,"Amazing what goals can do for one's recovery. Since Novemember Jen has worried about being Maid of Honour for her (since jr kindergarten) girlfriend. Well she came through with flying colours and helped make the day a success on Saturday. She didn't sleep at all the night before worried that she would slip on the wet grass of the hill and slide down it on her arse. You can see the concern or amazement on the faces of some of the guests as she tackles the hill without issue after over 24 hours of rain.  Unfortunately we weren't there, but our son grabbed a few hundred shots during the day. Wedding day was a long day for Jen.. out for makeup at 9am and I picked her exhausted body up at 10pm from the reception hall. So exhausted that she came home and got sick, and has taken about 3 days to get her energy back.          Getting pretty good at that one leg balancing act!  "
605287,GBW,2011-07-22 01:52:00,8460,"not a problem at all Wayne.  As long as you all pass it a long when Jenn doesn't nead it, give or take a month or two at this rate..."
605307,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-22 02:38:00,4399, Wayne something tells me that firecracker of yours wouldn`t have anything to do with a stair lift!
605311,rob v,2011-07-22 02:51:00,535,I've been away form the board for a bit but I'm really impressed with the news & updates !  Fantastic progress ! Sounds like small (big) miracles are happening every day !!
605552,irishfield,2011-07-23 02:55:00,26272,"Managed the full flight of stairs between the 11th and 12th floor today, up and down. We wheel chaired her to the Village Idiot for Ugly Shirt Friday lunch and she had to crutch her way into the place from the street and also managed the Loo in there as well. Entire surgical team and their onterage came by to see her at 6pm tonight to applaude her progress and wish her well. She has her pain med scripts and her special needs scripts so that we can get them filled before she has her 100+ staples removed on Sunday morning and then she's free to go home with us almost a month ahead of what was planned. Surgeon doesn't want to see her until early September when he jokingly told her she'd probably just walk in and see him crutchless at the rate she's going. Once home, she's allowed to use the pool come Wednesday and told to use a flutter board and see how the leg reacts. We can already hear the Doctor's keyboard keys clicking and highly expect her ""story"" to make the medical journals."
605580,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-07-23 10:18:00,1362,That's awesome news Wayne!!
605791,irishfield,2011-07-24 16:08:00,26272,"The Great Escape is well under way. Jennifer has her staples out, she's out of the hospital and in her apartment packing clothes. Leaving shortly for our home in Penetang, until she's a tad more self dependent. Was nice to see she didn't have any real trouble with her stairs down into her garden apartment!!!"
605792,mercman,2011-07-24 16:11:00,7054,Enjoy the rest of the summer Wayne. You and your familly desreve it
605794,irishfield,2011-07-24 16:26:00,26272,"Thanks Paul.. she's got a long struggle ahead of her, but it will be easier in our home than her apartment and she's not self dependent yet (and won't be for some time). With nothing mechanically holding her leg on, it has a mind of it's own where it wants to go right now.  We also have a pool at home, hoping that will be a big help in strengthening her legs. She can't do actual ""physio"" until she can put weight on the leg and that is months away."
605845,camillj,2011-07-24 20:42:00,1988,"Fabulous news Wayne, you and Jenn are an inspiration to us all. I have a feeling there's a 50+ waitin for her out on the bay somewhere"

606256,GBW,2011-07-26 00:54:00,8460,"I can feel the smile from here Wayne and I know all is well. As for the basket, I'll bring it to work with me one day this week so it's in the office.  Next week I'm out of town deep sea fishing so HH will have to help you all out there with a pick up meeting.    Either way, I'm VERY HAPPY to see all is well (so to say) and that all things will go to a good home when they are no longer needed.  Cheers my friends, take care. Geoff"

606401,ehg,2011-07-26 16:50:00,2666,What your daughter just went through is incredibly tough on all fronts. For her to have a big smile on her face as she leaves the hospital in record time is the best outcome imaginable. What an inspiration for all of us.
608185,irishfield,2011-08-01 01:26:00,26272,Post Op Day 25 was just peachy !   I have some good video but will have to clear it with the boss first and get it uploaded.  
608194,Fisherman,2011-08-01 01:40:00,7201,"I see some optimistic smiles there, hope for the best."
608198,irishfield,2011-08-01 01:50:00,26272,Hair is growing like crazy as well.. she's praying it comes in straight as it's been curly all her life and she's one of the funny gals that has to straighten it before going out !
604709,Nipfisher,2011-07-20 13:55:00,2449,"Way to go Jen. Take it slow, don't push too hard and full recovery will be yours."

604721,Grimace,2011-07-20 14:32:00,2020,That is very impressive.  Someone with every excuse in the world to mope around and be bitter but instead is crushing barriers with a cautious smile.  That is courage and strength.  Edit:spelling
604722,fishnsled,2011-07-20 14:32:00,3520," X2   Just speechless Wayne, words cannot even begin to express how we are all feeling about Jen's progress. Small steps for Jen, giant leaps in the hearts of many. I'm very touched that you have allowed us to be apart of this incredible journey. Thanks for sharing this with us Wayne. Keep on rambling!!"
604725,bassnass,2011-07-20 14:35:00,174,She'd  be a great motivspeaker!  Look how much she's inspired us clowns - and that was indirectly!
604736,Rich Clemens,2011-07-20 15:02:00,3131,Excellent.  SUre hope Jen's recovery keeps on moving along by leaps and bounds.   Great to see.
604758,irishfield,2011-07-20 16:06:00,26272,This morning she has progressed to using crutches!! and finds them easier than the walker. Suspect she'll switch back and forth to both modes of transportation. Walker = Sore arms... Crutches =  sore arm pits.  Gets her last antibotic bag today at 2pm and then the IV to her port will be removed. They were talking Friday discharge but she stalled that by stating she's planned a birthday party for her bf in the floor lounge for Saturday. Looks like she's gonna be going home Sunday to the amazement of those signing the requisitions!
604763,Nipfisher,2011-07-20 16:10:00,2449,  That is a small price to pay (pain) for all her successes. My guess is they probably thought she would use a wheelchair to begin.
604766,bassnass,2011-07-20 16:13:00,174,If she digs the crutches more - she should keep rockin' them - her pits will tough up within a week or reg. use - then she'll been runnin' laps round people - leaps n bounds
604771,irishfield,2011-07-20 16:26:00,26272, It was expected that she'd use a wheel chair for the first 3 months. Probably will somewhat around the house for awhile. She'll be going home with us so she can roam the first floor and will take over our bedroom and we'll go upstairs and use hers.
604783,Terry,2011-07-20 16:57:00,14456,I am blown away by that...  and a tear did come to my eye.....I had a hard time getting my brain around the idea she would walk again..but to see it and so soon after the operation is amazing...that is one hell of an amazing young lady you got there
604786,Spiel,2011-07-20 16:59:00,9065,"In a word....""incredible"""
604798,GBW,2011-07-20 17:29:00,8460,And so they should!  I'm going to show the videos to my kids when I get home just to teach them no matter how hard it is to overcome something it can be done.  THANKS JENN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (insert hero icon here)
604868,irishfield,2011-07-20 20:59:00,26272,"Surgeon just left.. the 100% cancer free statement the Oncologist made on Monday night wasn't just a feel good blurb, the pathologist cut the removed bone in slices/squares/slides and everything they put under the microscope is dead. Generally they are shooting for above 80% dead being satisfactory, 90% is great, 100% is never heard of !  Discharging Sunday and to save her a trip back to the city they are also going to remove her 100+ staples before she goes. Also okayed for Beerfest with her girlfriends if she uses a wheel chair... she's happy as a fat kid in a smarty factory !"
604872,camillj,2011-07-20 21:05:00,1988,"Absolutely fantastic news Wayne ... I can't tell you how thrilled I am at the progress and wonderful news. .. it has been a very long hard road for you and for Jenn and there is plenty of road ahead, but I know you are already the stronger and the richer for it. May god's blessings be on all of you !"
604889,express168,2011-07-20 22:23:00,327,Outstanding news! She is one tough cookie!
604902,GBW,2011-07-20 23:06:00,8460,"Wayne, please tell Jenn my daughter (Kaileigh, she's 7) said ""wow, she must be a very strong person"".  Thanks."
604930,spincast,2011-07-21 00:30:00,3279,WOW. Not sure what else to say. just WOW.  
604983,irishfield,2011-07-21 02:54:00,26272,Wheeled her over to Toronto General for food court supper at Hero Burger tonight. Then one of her Chemo unit nurses brought her in a celebration cake tonight   that she was to share with another lad 3 doors down on the floor. So I carried the cake and Jen crutched her way over to his room. One tired cookie... she'll sleep well tonight. Learns stairs tomorrow...
604987,motv8tr,2011-07-21 03:02:00,2587,"Great news all around Wayne, I know the family will be happy to be back home and out of the smog too  Maureen"

605273,irishfield,2011-07-22 00:35:00,26272,"No big problems with a simulated 2 step stair case today and going to try a full stair case tomorrow to see if she's able to do our 17 steps at home. Walked the length of the 11th floor on crutches. Surgeon is speechless! In and out of bed/chair/bathroom on her own, only hurdle right now is she can't roll over without that mechanical connection to her leg. Someone has to hold it. Tomorrow she's gonna try a velcro style strap that will lash one leg to the other to see if she can roll. Glad now that I didn't jump the gun and buy that stair lift I had scouted on kijji"
605274,GBW,2011-07-22 00:39:00,8460,"did she test out the new walker?  If so, how did it go VS the current one at the hospital?"
605275,irishfield,2011-07-22 00:42:00,26272,"She used it right after I got back from begging for change Geoff !! Seems to work pretty good, a bit close when she throws the disconnected leg forward and she was going to discuss it with the physiotherapist but forgot today. I think it will work great and the seat is a big ++ when she gets tired. THANKS again for your generosity and passing on some of your grandmothers legacy!"

604443,irishfield,2011-07-19 19:14:00,26272,"Out of bed and up to the walker without assistance this morning, then to the hall and back. Staff has her billed as the new poster child for Sarcoma recovery. They've never ever seen this recovery charge before...  They still have to get her onto crutches and able to hop stairs before she can be discharged, but she's well on her way. Told it will be a few months before she's allowed to put ANY weight on the right leg as the area the pelvic bone was removed from needs to scar in and simulate a socket for her leg.  Thanks for letting me ramble... it keeps me stable, well almost!"

Not dizzy, not in any pain, just happy as hell to be up off the bed. Sat in a chair for a few hours and then went back to the bed about an hour ago. It will be a few months before she's allowed to put any weight on her right leg, but she's off to a blazing start!  Yes I got video of her first steps! Gonna take a day or so before I can figure out how to get one of those up so you can break out a tissue!"

604345,irishfield,2011-07-19 14:15:00,26272,"I think it was more of a statement that he thought she needed to hear, but the surgeon did state he removed bone to ""clear margins"" after surgery and I suspect they were sending samples to the lab during the procedure to be sure of that. Jen was going to ask him when he came around this morning as he usually does before 9. We're a little behind this morning and haven't left for the hospital yet. The last few days have taken their toll on Leah, may have to leave her at the hospital for the rest of the week and let her sleep in Jen's room. Already have a folding bed/cot ready in Jen's room if need be."

603281,irishfield,2011-07-16 02:52:00,26272,"Still on target for getting out of bed on Monday. Doctors are almost speechless, they've never seen this recovery speed before (mind you I think she's only their 3rd that's had this type of surgery). They started at 6 weeks in bed with minimal movement.. then 4 weeks.. then 2 weeks and looks like 12 days since removing her right pelvic bone and partial sacrum that it's gonna happen. We'll see what Monday brings. If she's not ready, she's not ready, but I bet she does it!"
603290,fishnsled,2011-07-16 04:05:00,3520,"That's just incredible news Wayne!! Thanks for the update and fingers crossed for on Monday. If not Monday, it sounds like it will be very soon."

She was cut almost 360 degrees around her hip area to remove the bones, but at least with her they were nice and it appears she'll even be able to wear a bikini again. Don't think she'd like that picture posted here showing the hundreds of staples, but I have some that I am allowed to post once I have the capability when I get home."

Jen asked Dr. Wunder tonight if she could have monkey bars so she can lift herself up onto the ""pan"", instead of having 2 nurses roll her while holding her leg in place. Considering everything going on and the leg movement she has he didn't see why not, so it was installed by 7pm. From all their grins (Wunder, Davidson and their intern) they've never seen this progress before. Says he's gonna try to get her up on her good leg on Monday (about a week and a half to two weeks early). So I'll be sticking around to video that...  Kinda like waiting for her first steps 25 years ago..."

You wouldn't believe the smiles/laughs and spirit she had at 7 am on Wednesday while waiting for the Anethesiologist to come and get her. The will to live is an amazing thing. They gave her a hair net as part of her garb... she came out after changing and slapped it on her boyfriend's head.... as she has no hair! (well she actually has what we're calling 5 o'clock shadow now)

Not sure the fear is eating...it's what the by product is and the fact she is bed ridden flat on her back and can't move with an epideral still in her spine.."

Possibly 6 weeks of bed rest, possibly 3 months of wheel chair and then walker/crutches and trying to put weight on the now unattached (mechanically) leg. Hopefully it all goes quicker, but it's gonna be a long haul for all of us and especially Jennifer. No more in for a week and then home for two. Just stuck in there all together, as are we.  She's still got a positive attitude and I hope she can hang on to it throughout the process."

He's never had a patient at this stage of recovery by the next afternoon. No problems flexing her toes or moving her knee. They're not usually that mobile with an epideral still in.

600159,GBW,2011-07-07 02:39:00,8460,I got a text msg from Wayne and there was hope that Jenn would be out of the OR around 7PM.  I'm sure the stress on everyone is keeping him from the update.  I feel a    coming on soon (next time we hear from them).
600162,splashhopper,2011-07-07 02:42:00,2931,  That is great news....  thank you for updating us.....  let's see if we can keep this topic in the top 2- 3 posts until we hear from him.. ( or he texts you that he knows we are all thinking about his daughter tonight)
600167,GBW,2011-07-07 02:56:00,8460,"text sent at 10:40 (or so) PM  So from the sounds of it folks, keep the good thoughts and so forth coming as how I read this text, Jenn is looking up!"

600203,irishfield,2011-07-07 06:16:00,26272,"Thanks EVERYONE! Still in ICU as of 2am due to some blood pressure issues and is currently finishing up another transfusion. We're working on 3 hours sleep and have been up since 5am...so bear with me for mistakes or lack of info.  14.5 hours of surgery... 3 ortho surgeons, 2 anesthesiologists, 11 other staff of Nurses and Doctors in the room from 8am on. Wouldn't want that bill ! She's awake and alert... smiling and laughing but, that could be the morphine epideral!  Surgeon confident he removed all traces of tumor to clear margins. Appears to have saved her nerve line that runs her foot and also her knee. She can wiggle/curl her toes and bend her knee !  Thanks for all the positive thoughts, PM's and texts today and a big thanks to those that took time out of their day to drop into the hospital for hugs!"
600204,lew,2011-07-07 07:32:00,12766,That's some really positive news there Wayne and very nice to hear.  As a father I can feel what you guys are going through and I wish Jen all the best luck in the world and it sounds like she's got an excellent team of doctors & nurses looking after her.  I'll be watching this post for the next update.
600207,Terry,2011-07-07 09:15:00,14456,she has been in our thoughts all day
600209,Rich Clemens,2011-07-07 09:34:00,3131,Excellent.   Great news to start the day.  Been thinking about all you folks and will continue to do so.  Get some sleep my friend.
592435,lew,2011-06-13 08:03:00,12766,Thanks for keeping us informed Wayne and all the best to Jen with the upcoming surgery.
592441,Rich Clemens,2011-06-13 09:36:00,3131,Sure hope this is the end of the very looooooong road.  All our best.
592478,Tomcat,2011-06-13 12:43:00,395,Sure puts a broken spark plug in perspective. We'll keep Jen and your family in our thoughts and prayers this summer.
592498,irishfield,2011-06-13 13:48:00,26272,"Thanks folks!  This started out as a ""big shoulder"" for  me, but as time has gone on it appears it's been a very valuable 2 way street. I have had a fair number of members share their cancer battles with me during this time period, including JohnF. As recently as last night a board member shared their/their family cancer story with me and the battle that they have ahead of them. He told me that seeing Jennifer's attitude, through her battle, has given his wife the inspiration to fight hers. That right there makes this expanse of bandwidth worth while!"
592508,Rich Clemens,2011-06-13 14:15:00,3131,"It's something isn't it, how the younger ones face such obstacles with greater determination than us adults do.  We know a girl down here, a little younger than Wayne/Leah's daughter who is having all kinds of prolems with Chrones disease as well.  Surgery after surgery, procedure after procedure,  and this young lady is braver and stronger than a lot of people I know."
594950,irishfield,2011-06-21 05:07:00,26272,"After a tentative date was given this Thursday (of June 29th) a day later they called her to tell her that her surgery, to remove her entire right pelvic bone and part of her sacrum, will be on Wednesday July 6th. Nothing is getting replaced. Chemo has shrunk the soft tissue tumour back into the bone, but it unfortunately doesn't kill bone tumours so it all has to come out.  The most we know at this point is she has to be there first thing in the morning... the pre-op a week back was a blur but I think that was 7am for admission and I'll clarify that with Jennifer later. Surgery at minimum will be approximately 10 hours, could be up to 18 hours depending on what they find once they start. A big issue will be whether her nerve ""line"" that runs across the pelvic bone, that controls the ability to pick up your toes, is attached too firmly to the bone or easy to seperate. They are hoping it is not bonded to the bone, otherwise she'll need a brace to hold her toes up. If they can seperate it from the pelvic bone she should still have control of those muscles.  We are heading off to the lake (Temagami) on Thursday (23rd) for about 10days to hopefully enjoy some R n R.. cut the grass and all that goes with on Island Camp. Sounds like Jen is going to take the train up to Temagami, from Union Station, on Sunday or Monday to met us there........ as she'd like to climb the fire tower one more time before surgery. Then we'll come back on the 4th, so we can be in Toronto for the 5th.  Wayne"
594959,spincast,2011-06-21 09:34:00,3279,"our thoughts and best wishes for all of you Wayne. Great news on the cancer, but still a heavy load.  The strength Jen, you and family show is a great example on how much a positive atitiude contributes to beating these curses life throws at us.  What a great idea to climb the Tower! May the surgery go well and the best outcome possible be the end result."
594989,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-21 12:48:00,4399,Wayne I have no doubt that Jenn will come through this next challenge like the champion she is!!!  Enjoy your well deserved R&R.
596896,bassnass,2011-06-26 19:16:00,174,All the very best to you and yours Wayne.  I'm glad to hear you'll all be get a break and a rest away from it all!  Cheers
599472,irishfield,2011-07-05 04:23:00,26272,"Well she set out to do something and she did so !!!  My Brother has now challenged her to do it again post-op. That one's gonna take some time, but we have no doubts in our minds she'll be back up there again!!  Please cross what ever you have come Wednesday am ..  "
599476,Nipfisher,2011-07-05 04:35:00,2449,WE will all be thinking of you guys this week. Makes my little issues seem really small. Just curious...how long do they (specialists and surgeons) anticipate before they can replace some of the pelvic structure? That is quite alot of bone mass to lose. Jen is a champ. I get winded climbing the tower.
599477,irishfield,2011-07-05 04:38:00,26272,"Nothing is being replaced Nip... Once they take as much of her sacrum as they can, without hitting spinal nerves, there is no hard bone left to attach anything to."
599480,Nipfisher,2011-07-05 04:43:00,2449,  Wow I just read back and had missed that part. I fractured my Saccrum falling while playing hockey as a teenager. I had to sit on one of them donut rings for months. Especially whole sitting in a car.
599588,mercman,2011-07-05 16:38:00,7054,"Still in my thoughts Wayne. From what i have seen of Jen, she will triumph over this too"
599840,irishfield,2011-07-06 03:25:00,26272,"Well she's still wound up like a rubber band. Making little piles of stuff that she can instruct us to bring in as time goes on. Hopefully we can get to bed soon as 5am is gonna come way tooooo early. She has to be in admissions by 6am.  I will try to post an update here late tomorrow, but it might very well be Thursday before I can do so. The fellow that bumped her surgery date last week was 15 hours on the table last Wednesday and they had to stop and then do another 8 hours on Thursday. Hope to God that isn't the case with Jen tomorrow and the surgery gets completed in one day."
599857,Rich Clemens,2011-07-06 09:22:00,3131,"Keep us posted. Jen, and all of you are on our hearts and minds today.  All our best ... and more."
599858,Big Cliff,2011-07-06 09:36:00,6899,We'll be thinking of all of you and keeping our fingures crossed.
599861,ehg,2011-07-06 10:05:00,2666,All the best wishes and prayers for Jen to come through this. One thing that is clear in this thread is the strength of spirit that she has and huge support all around for her. It will be super tough but you all will get through to way better times.
599862,Tarzan's Jane,2011-07-06 10:18:00,1183,This day has come pretty quick.  May God have his hand in performing the surgery.  We are thinking of you Jen and pray that all will go well.  Looking forward to good news. Nancy

599946,splashhopper,2011-07-06 16:15:00,2931,May your daughter be graced by His strength through the surgeons hands.  May He bless and comfort you and your wife's heart through all this.  And may he carry Jenn's spirit in His hands during the procedure to comfort her and talk with her about her fears and anxiety of what tomorrow may bring for her.  God bless  Ron and family
599970,Rod Caster,2011-07-06 16:58:00,5784,Best of luck Wayne and family. She is clearly loved beyond words by those closest to her.

588688,irishfield,2011-06-01 02:57:00,26272,"Thanks guys!  Another good day... 2 bags of blood, 3 varieties of chemo and she still wanted to get unhooked and go out for supper. Walked all the way to Young/Gould (and back), in the 40C humidex, and even had to slow down so Leah could keep up!!   4 days to go.. done by 4pm on Saturday."
588697,GBW,2011-06-01 03:26:00,8460,nice! I would give her her a kiss to tell her how strong I think she is (and to keep at it) BUT I know it won't go over well on many levels. *edit* added info
588698,irishfield,2011-06-01 03:29:00,26272,If all you're looking for Geoff is a kiss... I'll give you one!
589371,irishfield,2011-06-03 03:30:00,26272,"Two more sleeps 'till ""graduation"" day ! All 10 chemo's (5 x 2 day treatments and 5 x 6 day treatments) will be done, on schedule come Saturday am !!   Can't wait to see the last MRI on Monday to see what, if any, soft tisue tumour remains from the outgrowth of this bone cancer. Should be totally gone based on previous progression."
589374,ctdd2006,2011-06-03 03:40:00,531, best news of the day after a crappy day and a reminder  to all of us lucky to have our health that........  I'll leave it up to those of us that sometimes feel sorry for ourselves to fill in those blanks!  Go Jen!  Kick ass!
590849,irishfield,2011-06-08 01:58:00,26272,"Well as many know.. chemo #10 is in the books as of Saturday and was hopefully the last ever. This Monday Jen had an MRI at 6:30 am.. waited to see the surgeon at 9:30 (ended up being 10:30) with, disappointingly, no date given for surgery. Then a pre-op appointment at 11 to see if she's fit for surgery, which in her current condition with 78/55 blood pressure is not. Hopefully a couple weeks of fluids and good meals will have her up closer to 95/60 or so and surgery is ball parked between last week of June and first week of July at this point. The great news is the massive soft tissue tumor has been shrunk pretty much right back to the bone from where it came. The bad news is the entire right pelvic bone and a good portion of her sacrum still have to come out, as chemo doesn't kill bone tumors. Nothing gets replaced, expected of scar tissue and existing muscles to hold her leg on and make it work. Gonna be a LONG haul after surgery.  Gonna share a few pictures here to show just how much spunk some of these ""kids"" have in the Sarcoma unit. We see many that never get out of bed, never smile and recovery/prognosis seems to go hand in hand with that unfortunately. Now these two should live for ever. Ewing's sarcoma is one of the rarest forms of cancer. Only 40 cases a year diagnosed, so what's the chances of these two having not only Ewing's in common.. but the same right pelvic bone??!    Jen knew it was ""B's"" birthday on Monday (poor bugger turning 18 while sitting in the sarcoma unit   ), so Sunday night we had to hit the dollar store for some presents. Jen got him a big bag of toys for $10 + tax and they proceeded to ring them all out on Monday, shortly after they had their chemo drips hooked up.      Friday we thought we should get Jen a graduation present... like they say, it's the thought that counts! lol    Our younger daughter Kristal finally got to throw ""spa night"" for Jen on Friday night. I'm sure it broke a million hospital rules, but ask us if we care!    "

I salute you for this, and i cheer for Jen as she takes one more step towards winning the battle against this dastardly illness.

581644,irishfield,2011-05-11 02:37:00,26272,Thanks for all the thoughts folks... she passed her blood test with flying colours yesterday and is well into day 2 of 6 of chemo #9. Home Saturday.  Chemo #10 (full week) and hopefully the final chemo she'll ever see is scheduled to start May 30th. MRI booked for same day to get the surgeon the final picture and a pre-op appointment is booked for the following Monday so we know things are on track. I suspect that day we'll learn what day surgery is.
581662,fishnsled,2011-05-11 03:37:00,3520,Hope this round goes OK and that the next one will be the final chemo she will need on the road to recovery. Your family is in my thoughts and if you need anything don't hesitate to ask.
581663,irishfield,2011-05-11 03:45:00,26272,"Thanks Will !!  Also need to thank Vinnimon's daughters for a gift that Vince left for me on Lloyd's boat on Sunday and Snowballs' wife, from Thunder Bay, mailing Jennifer a nice afghan that she knitted."
581699,mercman,2011-05-11 11:33:00,7054,Sounds like things are on a positive swing Wayne Keep hangin in there buddy.Give her a big thumbs up from me.  Paul
581929,irishfield,2011-05-12 03:46:00,26272,"Thanks Paul... we were surprised tonight, she asked to be unhooked from her Portacath line from 5:30 to 8:00 (something she hasn't had them do since the first full week chemo) and walked all the way to Jack Astors for supper at the corner of Young and Dundas.. and back! I figured she'd be riding on my shoulders back to the hospital, but she'll be sleeping well tonight!"
581930,camillj,2011-05-12 03:51:00,1988,Great news Wayne... gotta take the small blessings and grab on to them !
581931,irishfield,2011-05-12 03:58:00,26272,"It is Jon.. she hasn't showed that energy during the full week chemo's since they started. About lunch time she got it in her mind to get unhooked and go out for supper.. so we didn't hesitate. She hates being unhooked due to the immediate taste associated with having her portacath line flushed at unhook and again at rehook. She can be unhooked in the early morning and again at supper time, but she hasn't had it done more than three times out of a possible 40 times so far."
588272,irishfield,2011-05-30 23:36:00,26272,"Chemo #10 ( should be the final one!) underway after a hair pulling morning. Someone dropped the ball and didn't book her MRI for 8am this morning to get the final picture before surgery. Blood work a ""barely passed"" with low hemoglobin but going ahead with chemo, while at the same time getting a blood transfusion each morning to get her red count up. Sent for an X-ray... first come.. first served and that delayed getting her chemo going by almost 3 hours, but she's still up beat and day one's chemo is in the books and a night of Mesna IV started. 4 more days of chemo and she can kick the ""habit"" for ever!! Or that better be how it goes...  One of the very few patients Dr. Blackstein has ever had that managed to never fail a blood test and do all 10 treatments on schedule!!!  MRI now booked for next Monday am at 7am.. Surgeon consult at 9:30 and then pre-op testing later that day. Surgery date to follow.. suspecting week of the 20th, but we should know in 6 days for sure!"
588280,Joey,2011-05-30 23:53:00,9122,"Well that all sounds ""good"" Wayne, as good as it can be under the circumstances.  Keeping you all in my thoughts.  Joey"
588282,ehg,2011-05-30 23:55:00,2666,"Hope things work out well Wayne, surely she is getting the best treatment available, despite little oversight here and there. Like said before your daughter is lucky to have great parents by her side all the way."
588285,Grimace,2011-05-31 00:15:00,2020,You are going to be filled with joy when this is done and you and your wife get to witness your daughter gathering strength and health every day.

I admire you for your strength and commitment to fighting this step by step with Jen, and for sharing the fight with us.After following these updates since last year, little problems dont get to me any more, and i find myself more drateful for the goodness in  my life.  Thank you, and keep being strong.There will be time to relax later on."
588346,HTHM,2011-05-31 02:36:00,4082,I got a lunch with your name on it if you would like.
588347,irishfield,2011-05-31 02:45:00,26272,"Thanks Guys... and Paul it really does make you sit back and wonder why we complain about stupid little things that we have no control over like the weather, price of gas or the bite on any certain day!  Albert.. thanks! Not sure what all is in store for this week or the spare time we'll have. We usually only get out/away from the hospital for one lunch during a week treatment and that one day is already tied up in picking up a wheel chair and walker. Our youngest daughter is also coming in on the bus, either Wed or Thurs, so until we get her game plan everything is up in the air.  Once surgery is upon us... we'll be in the city for at minimum a month and a half (could be 5 months), suspect there'll be lots of lunch opportunities with that!"
588351,Ziki,2011-05-31 02:59:00,128,Good to hear the treatment is going well. This thread really rips at my heart. You are right on about the stupid little things in life!   all the best Wayne
588354,GBW,2011-05-31 03:06:00,8460," I quote Paul as he hit the nail on the head, so to say.  ALL of you are being so strong it makes me feel like I could have done more in life and failed to do so.  But Wayne, I'm (trying to find the right word(s) here) I'm very happy to have met you all and been even 0.1% of the solution to help, cheers!  As for lunch, I hope to have everything here Wednesday by noon for Jen so I'm not booking anything for Thursday so we can hook up.  I think I just came up with a new sig. in this reply too. ""It's a long road, take small steps and try and walk a straight line to your goal"" GBW"
588390,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-31 10:29:00,4399,Wow that girl of yours sounds like one tough customer Wayne!
560169,irishfield,2011-03-10 02:40:00,26272,"Thanks guys and Albert x 2.. Ketch I hear yah and know what you're saying. We'd discussed that and remember what I said, taking comfort in the fact she's proud of the family she's raised and the life she's lived."
560184,rob v,2011-03-10 03:45:00,535,"Wayne, my hat's off to you, your daughter and your family.   You've all got an amazing spirit !   May God bless !!"
560189,ehg,2011-03-10 04:04:00,2666,Your daughter will pull through this! It sounds pretty tough but she has a chain of strength and support to pull her through.  Have had to go to walkers and forearm canes myself due to MS. Think of you and your daughters plight to create a positive vision.  Surely your strength of character is carried within her.
560195,irishfield,2011-03-10 05:06:00,26272,Thanks Rob.. Erik! I've gotta say we've got a great community here. There are another select few here that I've got to thank for sending me Pm's and sharing their own personal battles with me. A few here fighting their own cancer battles that should be proud considering the dignity and courage that they've shown to me! Thanks from the bottom of my heart for all involved.
560202,Live2fish85,2011-03-10 06:48:00,1633,"I'm sorry to hear about your last few weeks, I hope it's all up hill from here and they say having a positive attitude is one of the best things. It's kept me here, and I'm sure it will do the same for your daughter. It's great to hear that she has such great Doctors to, It really can make a difference. I give my best to your family through these hard times, and I will pray for your daughter.  Chris"
560207,spincast,2011-03-10 10:34:00,3279,"Wayne to you and your family - like many others the sheer weight of your current situation takes away my ability to put into words anything thats sounds adequate. Know that Jennifer and indeed your whole family are in my prayers, and the strength and determination you guys show is an exmaple for everyone. If ever there was someone who can beat this be sheer willpower, it is the fighting O'Sheas."
560217,Fisherman,2011-03-10 12:33:00,7201,"Wayne and your family, I really hope things take a real turn for the better, this is something no one should have to endure.  I wish her the best."

560226,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-10 13:21:00,1022,"Keep a positive attitude and all will work out. Go to a video rental store and rent a documentary called ""The Secret"". It is a documentary about how positive thinking, good spirit and being happy will help you succeed/maintain good health. One particular part of the documentay shows a middle aged woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer and she refused to have chemo or any type of treatment. Instead, she kept a positive attitude and watched comedies/shows and movies that made her laugh. When she returned to the doctors, they were shocked as the cancer had cleared from her body on its own. Give it a shot, you wont be disappointed!"
560237,bpsbassman,2011-03-10 14:07:00,941,"Wayne, I haven't been around for awhile and this is the first thread that I'm catching up on.  An emotional start to say the least.  As many have said, it is so hard to find the right words at this time.  Just know that your daughter and your family are in my daily prayers. Hang in Wayne, there's a huge family here for support."
560435,bassnass,2011-03-11 00:10:00,174,"Brother, I'm not religious by any means - but there's is no question as to the power of positivity - and yours is outstanding.  I'm sending good vibes and adding to the positivity pile - here's to seein' through to brighter days!  You and your family, from what I gather, are shining examples of the human spirit - on par with this fellow...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciYk-UwqFKA   Yeah, it's a tad cheesey at the end - buy hey, he's workin' it.   You guys keep workin' it!  (and I hope your daughter has a blast at her weddings!)"

Chemo #6 done.. she's back in her apartment and Leah is hangin there for the week in case she gets a fever again, as Jen wants to go to Sinai this time instead of Redneck emerg here if it happens.  I just got home an hour or so ago, so I can start on three companies tax returns that are due by months end."
561273,HTHM,2011-03-13 02:41:00,4082,"When you look at the time line for this, it has gone quite quickly IMHO. You disclosed the sad news 5 months ago, and now they are at the surgery determination already. All in all I would give kudos to our health care system, except for the ridiculous pill cost. As for the tax returns, isn't that what accountants are for?"
561277,irishfield,2011-03-13 02:50:00,26272,Glad it's gone quickly for you Albert!   .. and that anti-infection needle went up by 5% in January  As for accountants.. I don't need one of them to tell me what I already know and to add to the year end loss ! When I had the lawyer take care of my sister's final tax returns the CA charged us $530 to do a simple tax return with 5 slips (that I could have done manually in about 40 minutes)... and they did it wrong to boot with CRA sending us a credit.  I've done my own two and Leah's business returns for 20+ years and only been audited once because they were toooo stupid to figure out why my GST wasn't 7% of total sales.
561303,irishfield,2011-03-13 05:10:00,26272,Yep.. the name on the wrist band still matches the label on the bag... gitter done!  Also a great distraction on Thursday... my Great Niece (4.5 months) and my niece dropped by the hospital.  
561311,Moosebunk,2011-03-13 08:45:00,3970,There needs to be two or three of ya Wayne for that pace of one.
561351,MJL,2011-03-13 15:42:00,2427, I wish I had a cool wristband like that at Sunnybrook  Great to hear #6 is done Wayne.  I still have a few packs of ondansetron if Jen needs it  Thanks for the updates  Mike

561970,Tarzan's Jane,2011-03-15 11:58:00,1183,"Hi Wayne  Words are just that, words....but they can be so powerful, so life changing.  I don't have any of those for you...I've been struggling to find some for myself and those that I love that recently are fighting their own battles....but none are fighting what your family is and it makes me feel small...small because I have raised my fist and crawled away not wanting and not having the will to see it through.  I will see it through though, but I'm so tired....you must be exhausted.  Your daughter's upcoming surgery is like none that I have heard of before.  The will to live is quite something isn't it. Lord....please have mercy.....please."
561988,bassnass,2011-03-15 13:41:00,174,"Wayne, I tell ya - you're spirit is an inspiration.  You're truly doing the best things in the best way that anyone could.  I admire your focus - and take solace in the fact that in a situation where you might feel powerless, you're doing everything that makes you a powerful force for everyone around - from keeping that positivity, to taking care of your day-to-day (taxes!?!!  I can't do my taxes at the best of times!).  You da man, brother.  Stay up! L"
575321,irishfield,2011-04-22 21:40:00,26272,"So here we are 1.5 months later.. 2 more chemos down and hopefully only 2 more to go. Doctor threw a curve for us on Wednesday morning.. .was supposed to be a full week treatment right thru the Easter Weekend. Instead he changed it to just an overnight treatment so the last two will be full week ones instead of alternating.  Jen's younger sister had a surprise spa night all planned for 8 or 9 gals on Thursday night.. so we picked her up in Cambridge Tuesday am after working our way past a closed 401 at Mavis Rd. Worked our way back from Cambridge via the 407 to get both girls to a ""feel good - look good"" seminar at Mount Sinai for 2pm on Tuesday. I got them there at 2:02. We had visits from family planned and spread out for the entire week, including a relay delivery of my 83 year old step father from Smiths Falls for Sunday as a surprise. Easter dinner for ourselves all planned for NEXT weekend. All out the window thanks to the Oncologist throwing the change up (and probably the hospital telling him they didn't want any OT for sarcoma nurses on the weekend). Advance notice would have been just swell !  We had some great comic relief though to help put all that behind us. My older brother, that has made it to every chemo start day thus far (while recovering from his own quint heart bypass), is now greatly upset that he won't be able to see Jen to the end and attend #10. He has his aviation medical back and he's accepted a Captains position in Kazakhstan (A330 airbus), starting May 16th. Here he is explaining to our daughter Kristal where exactly Kazakhstan is on the world map.... (11 time zones around the world)    I think I mentioned it before... he's been challenging Jen to get to 100 lbs before Easter. She's currently 44.5 kg ~ 98lbs... but I gave her two 0.5 kg weights to put in her pockets when she stepped on the sarcoma unit scale for him!   Above and beyond.. he got her a plaque. ""One Hundred Pounds by Easter Challenge""    I scrambled Geoff's plans as well. Thankfully he'd brought the eReader to work with him on Wednesday. Snuck over quickly during his lunch hour to present it to Jennifer. THANKS to all involved.    Next chemo scheduled for May 9th. Full week. Good chance she'll fail her blood test and get bumped a week later, but we hope not or it will screw up some bridal shower plans. She just squeaked by on this weeks blood test, so there's a good chance she'll be too low on white cells on the 9th. Only time will tell, but hopefully things will stay on track for a tentative late June surgery date.  Thanks for listening to my rambling.."
575389,muskymike,2011-04-23 01:41:00,772,"Wayne, this is definitely not rambling. We are all still here for you and will always be. Your family is in all of our thoughts and prayers."

MRI from Friday shows that her tumour is about 5/8th's the size it was in October... so the chemo is definitely working. She walks with barely a limp.  Surgery... we thought was possibly after the 4th chemo and Jen was psych'd up for it..... but the surgeon is off heli skiing in BC and Oncologist thinks with what MAY happen that Jennifer will end up immobilized for 8 to 12 weeks and he can't do chemo if she's immobilized, but can't consult with the AWOL surgeon to be sure what the plan is. Oncol leaves on Holidays Monday for a week.. so nothing looks like it will happen before next chemo scheduled for the 16th of Feb.  We continue a day at a time..."

Humbling part 1.. watching her usual roomy.. a women that is 4 months younger than myself with sarcoma in her leg. She had surgery first and then was supposed to have 5 chemo sessions. She's had 3.. and the 3rd almost killed her dropping all her blood counts including platlets to zilch. She was told her body can't handle anymore chemo and to go home... with the hope that 3 sessions was enough to put it in remission.  Humbling part 2.. watching the 21 year old girl straight across from Jen get the news that the chemo isn't killing the sarcoma in her arm and they will have to amputate her left arm/shoulder and partial rib cage. She also found a lump in her sternum area yesterday and if this weeks biopsy finds that to be cancer has spread to her lungs, then there will be no surgery.. she' ll be sent home to get her things in order.

I've racked my brain trying to think of just the right thing to say that will make me feel less sad and you feel as strong as you seem to the rest of us...

So I will share a poem from my client's son:  UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE  A SET OF STANDARDS BY WHICH TO JUDGE TO THEIR FRIENDS, THEY GIVE A NUDGE WHEN THEY SEE ME COME THEIR WAY, THEY STOP AND WALK THE OTHER WAY OR EVEN WORSE, THEY STOP AND STARE AS IF I'M STUPID AND UNAWARE.  IF ONLY THEY COULD KNOW, THAT I CARE; HOW PEOPLE VIEW ME--IT'S JUST NOT FAIR! I FEEL THE VERY SAME AS OTHERS DO, THEY SHOULD TRY AND WALK IN MY SHOE.  LIFE'S NOT EASY, WHEN THE BODY THAT YOU OWN WAS GIVEN TO YOU BROKEN-DOWN. THEY MAY BE MEAN; THEY MAY BE CRUEL; THEY MAY BE BAD; BUT MOST OF ALL...THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.  WITH SOME TIME AND SPECIAL GUIDANCE; WE CAN HAVE A GREAT ALLIANCE. FOR AN HOUR, OR FOR A DAY; WE ALL NEED FRIENDS ALONG THE WAY.  SO WHEN YOU SEE ME COME ALONG TRY NOT TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS WRONG; I AM A PERSON JUST LIKE YOU, WHO NEEDS AND DESERVES A GOOD FRIEND TOO.  JUST WALK BESIDE ME STRAIGHT AND TALL AND BE THE FRIEND THAT I CAN CALL WHEN I AM LONELY AND AFRAID. JUST REMEMBER WHAT I'VE SAID: ALL YOU NEED IS TO UNDERSTAND; DO NOT JUDGE JUST TAKE MY HAND.

560153,irishfield,2011-03-10 02:13:00,26272,"Felt compelled to update those that truely seem to care here on OFC.  We're 3 days into Chemo #6.. 3 days to go. Then 4 more chemo's ending late into May. Surgeon has been in and spent an hour or more with us late Monday night. Willing to work around the first wedding Jennifer ""needs"" to be at in June and then he must get on with surgery about 3 weeks into June and hopes she's healed enough to be maid of honour for a wedding in September.  Because her bone tumour is covering most, if not all of her right pelvic bone and also crossing the ""line"" into her sacrium (sp) bone.. they must remove all of the r pelvic and as much of the sacrium as they can without hitting the nerves beside the spine. This leaves nothing to bolt anything to.. so there will be no replacement of any kind. It is expected that the scar tissue and the existing muscles will hold the leg on and that hopefully in time she will be able to put her body weight on the right leg. Looking like 4 to 8 weeks in hospital after surgery.. lots of rehab.. maybe walking with weight on leg in 6 months or so. In the mean time a walker.. then polio style crutches.. then crutches. then hopefully cane and then god please walking with a lift in her shoe.  A real hard kick for someone with a gymnastics background and 3 times per week volleyball playing up until this started. But she can't play if she's dead either. Something that she's definitely not ignorant to the fact of. Happy that it sounds like there'll be no radiation and she has a great chance of still being able to have kids. Going to be interesting without half a pelvic bone, but it sounds like it can be done with supports.  We now know that she's definitely in the best hospital for cancer surgery in Canada. We know that as her next door neighbour Monday/Tuesday and until this morning was ""Mr Smith"".. aka Jack La yt on and he could go anywhere he wanted. Was hoping to talk heath care with Jack this morning, but he was discharged early this am. As much as I can't stand the guy I wish Jack the best, he left on crutches this morning which suggest his prostate cancer has spread to elsewhere requiring more surgery that he had either last week or over the weekend. He was already there when we arrived Monday am.  Just when you think you have your emotions in check and your head wrapped around all this this afternoon they posted another death notice, on the sarcoma unit cork board, for a young girl from Belleville. Succumed to her osteosarcoma on Feb 10th. just 6 week shy of her 16th birthday.. it's just not right.  Thanks for your shoulders folks!"

531599,TJQ,2010-12-24 17:59:00,7806,Chin up Wayne.. there's only one way to move and that's forward.. but you already know that. I hope things work out.
531603,misfish,2010-12-24 18:23:00,29133,Aint much more I can say that I havent already budz. Like the Boss said.
531620,camillj,2010-12-24 19:49:00,1988,"Wayne, from the bottom of my heart, all the warmest wishes to you, Leah, Jen and all those close to you.  It is perhaps when things are the hardest and bleakest that the truest meanings of Christmas can be found.  I hope you are able to find some joy and happiness through your difficulties, knowing that many people have a special place set aside this Christmas in their hearts, thoughts and prayers for you and your family."
531736,irishfield,2010-12-25 01:55:00,26272,Well the Christmas Miracle on our Street... I brought her home 10 minutes ago !!

531912,skeeter,2010-12-25 20:16:00,1907,"see i asked for more good posts from OFNrs, and now we are starting to get them!!!!!!!! That is great news Wayne. "
531913,misfish,2010-12-25 20:33:00,29133,Nice to see her Wayne.  TY
531931,Dusky,2010-12-25 22:33:00,310,That's great Wayne!! I guess best Christmas present one can get.
536522,irishfield,2011-01-08 17:06:00,26272,"So many (appreciated) emails and PM's... so little time, so I thought I'd update here.  Jen had her 3rd chemo on Wednesday and weighed in at 91 lbs. Again the heavy push variety, like the first chemo, all given in 2 hours + 20 hours of bladder protectant and anti-nausea drips into her portacath.. disconnected and out Thursday shortly after lunch. Needle at 4:30, at her apartment, then we loaded everything up and came home through the mess of snow.  So far so good this round, she's still eating fairly well and not feeling sick. Yesterday we awoke to 14"" of new snow. Leah had 3 Dr. appointments of her own to get to, so I got Jen breakfast.. took her temperature and then went out to plow snow. About half way thru plowing I hear out of the 2 way radio .. ""Dad, I want lunch in the next 20 minutes"".    Park the truck, make food and then back out to finish plowing.  She's fighting some severe bone ache, but other than that getting some fairly decent sleep and being a couch potato. Hopefully she makes it to the next chemo without incident/fever etc. Has an MRI booked for the 21st to get the surgeon a new picture and her next full week chemo is the 26th to 31st. Then we're pretty sure she'll be having her surgery to remove what ever they need to to make her tumour free and then 6 more chemo treatments. Hopefully by late June we'll have her sitting on the dock enjoying some much needed R n R"
536523,splashhopper,2011-01-08 17:08:00,2931,Prayers from our family to your's Irish
536646,esoxansteel,2011-01-08 21:14:00,1307,"All the best for a healthy recovery from my family to yours, and im sure shell be tanning on the dock this summer, she is in the best of care, and her positive attitude and family support will see her throught this setback"

536816,Loonietoon,2011-01-09 01:19:00,1450,just like you told me Wayne.. Keep up the battle.. Wife just finishing her 2nd round this Tuesday coming then another short rest then on the round 3 so far she too is eating good.. little off now because she is coming off the anti nausia pills.... Believe just like me it will be beat....You keep telling me this
536821,misfish,2011-01-09 01:26:00,29133,ROCK FOR CURE IS COMING SOON FOLKS.
527016,MJL,2010-12-10 02:49:00,2427,"She's working?!  That's incredible.  She's simply an amazing lady. If she's working at Ryerson, I might run into her when I visit a few of my old profs in the new year  The force is strong in Jen...Judging by the pic, her light saber is out and ready for action  Best wishes"
527019,irishfield,2010-12-10 02:51:00,26272,Thanks Mike.. she works in the RAC..  Guess the food was good today.. she's up to 88/89 lbs !!
528295,irishfield,2010-12-14 06:01:00,26272,"Passed her blood work this morning, so weighed in @ up 8 lbs from 2 weeks ago (85lbs), and chemo #2 is now well under way. All week long.. chemo for about 7 hours each day, anti infection needle Saturday afternoon and then home for Christmas. Then next chemo is now booked for Jan 5th, unless they change that by doing surgery... which is coming for sure now as we by fluke rode the elevator down from the 11th floor and walked to the parking garage with her Oncologist at 10:30 tonight (there's a dedicated man ...14.5 hrs after his office opens). The decision has apparently been made, but he wasn't sure all the details as he's not the surgeon."
528304,misfish,2010-12-14 10:30:00,29133,"Thanks Wayne for the update. It would seem Jens spirits must be gaining stenght as she is eating and getting about. That a girl Jen. Keep at it.There light at the end of the tunnel is nearer.  Thoughts and prayers are always with you O,sheas."
528306,solopaddler,2010-12-14 10:41:00,8605,"8lb's is a lot of weight in two weeks, great to hear!"
528315,mercman,2010-12-14 12:01:00,7054,Thanks for the news Wayne.Sounds like she is getting a bit stronger.Keep up the fight and have a wonderful Christmas.  Paul  
528319,Terry,2010-12-14 12:28:00,14456,thanks for the update if you need anything give me a shout
529030,irishfield,2010-12-16 05:47:00,26272,"Up another kilo today... but not for lack of nagging from the parentals. Hospital food.. almost untouchable. Some she won't even open the lid on with the pre-derived notion that it's terrible. Seems to be the issue with all 6 of the patients in the Sarcoma chemo unit, so we're bringing in food from home and restaurants to keep her weight up. Monday night I walked 1/2 of downtown yonge street to fill her request for an assorted from Mr. Sub. They are few and far between these days.. sad with one of the oldest franchises in Canada... of course I saw one today at the corner of College and Spadina that's a lot closer to the hospital!  Two more days of chemo...discharge Saturday am and the VON nurse has been requested for after 2 on Saturday to give her the anti infection needle and then we can hopefully take her home for Christmas. Have a feeling we'll find out a requested MRI will be next week to screw things up, but if it is.... it is."
529032,misfish,2010-12-16 10:11:00,29133,Thanks again Wayne for the update. One day at a time.
529037,mercman,2010-12-16 12:19:00,7054,"Thanks for th update my friend.One day at a time, and even one second at a time if you  have to.good that she is eating and gaining weight you ar all in my thoughts and prayers.  Paul"
529041,solopaddler,2010-12-16 12:35:00,8605,"Smart girl, I wouldn't eat the hospital food either.  Thanks for the update."
529757,irishfield,2010-12-18 04:45:00,26272,"Day 5 chemo over.. Hero Burger saved the day again tonight!! Checks out at 8am and then we have to wait for the nurse to come by the apartment... to give Jen her needle, after 2pm(has to be 24 hours after chemo finishes), before heading home to our house for Christmas!"
529773,motv8tr,2010-12-18 08:13:00,2587,"Glad to hear it Wayne, she'll do much better at home now and get some good food   Enjoy your Christmas.  Maureen"

531474,irishfield,2010-12-24 04:41:00,26272,"We had to admit Jen for fever, here at the local hospital, last night. Looks like she's stuck there 'till at least Christmas Day, possibly longer. Leah now has a fever as well so can't even visit Jen. Maybe we'll have Christmas in July. Now back to sterilizing my system.. .."
531480,HTHM,2010-12-24 05:12:00,4082,"Aw, that sucks Wayne, you have my sympathy."
531496,solopaddler,2010-12-24 11:10:00,8605,I was just thinking you'd probably have Jen home or at least enroute.  Another hurdle to cross Wayne and you and your family will do it.  Here's hoping for a Christmas day homecoming.
531501,Grimace,2010-12-24 12:04:00,2020,"I read the updates and am not sure what to say so I don't say anything.  I hope your family gets a little cheer out of this Christmas.  Keep up with the updates I am sure there are many like me that do not comment much but are interested in what is going on.  I think of your family every once in a while driving to work and I hug my son a little harder or I call my mother and father that day or Shovel the driveway for my wife (joke).  Anyways, when your family gets through this, you guys will be unstoppable.  Merry Christmas"
522899,irishfield,2010-11-26 03:03:00,26272,"Thanks guys!  PET scan from last week shows there isn't cancer anywhere else in her body, thank God for that, however in addition to the already known right pelvic bone it is also on the edges of her hip socket. Surgery now appears to be a definite vs the maybes we got before. When is unknown.. mid way thru or at the end of chemo and then the high possibilty of radiation treatments.  She's come close.. but so far she hasn't been sick. I left at noon or so today and left Leah behind. Was a tough thing to do and actually start the truck.....  I then get home to a postal cards in the mail box... down to the outlet and it's the shampoo I ordered from Long Island NY and the conditoner from California that may help her keep her hair. Drive all the way back to TO into rush hour, drop the package, and all the way back home.  She's hoping she can go to work Monday or Tuesday, but seeing what I've seen for the last 4 days... I don't see it happening."
522937,mbac31,2010-11-26 08:07:00,904,"Reading this post brings a tear to my eye Wayne. Having my own Little girl now I can imagine what your feeling. She seems like one hell of a tough girl though. They have come a long way with the advancements of Cancer and I'm sure she will benefit from that in a good way and we will be reading a different post soon enough. My thoughts and prayers go out to you and your family. There is always room here if you need it. I dont live to far from there, East end of Scarborough."
523003,irishfield,2010-11-26 16:18:00,26272,Thanks Smallie.. I'm told this morning she's a lot more alert and chipper.. and used less pain killers than normal yesterday.. actually ate a full pancake and ran from the living room to bathroom (25 feet)fast enough that Leah thought something was wrong. She just had to go.. lol.. but she hasn't run in a long long time. There's hope yet that she'll get to work next week.
523009,Moosebunk,2010-11-26 16:29:00,3970,"It's certainly not just the strength of your daughter that'll put your family past this Wayne.  You're awesome bud, Leah too, keep being the parents you are.  Thinking of you all and well wishes."
523014,irishfield,2010-11-26 16:44:00,26272,"Na.. it's totally the ""kid"" Drew!! Here she is all hooked up to the gin pole and waiting for her chemo to be injected. I think she's telling the cancer where it can go... or maybe it's for me! lol "
523028,I'mHooked,2010-11-26 17:17:00,525,"ah, great photo Wayne!  She looks like she's ready for the fight!  ...Or maybe she does just want the camera to disappear"
523038,irishfield,2010-11-26 17:32:00,26272,"No.. she actually asked me to take pictures this round to document it all.  She was pissed with me when she had her crohn's surgery and I took pictures..   (what ever it takes to make them smile!)  but she beat that one hands down, so figures maybe she should go with it this time for the same outcome!!"
523040,mercman,2010-11-26 17:41:00,7054,You're a good man Wayne.  
523050,Smarty Pantz,2010-11-26 18:00:00,203,"Wow Wayne, you have one very strong brave daughter there! Keep makin' her smile & laugh    Wishing all the best of luck & will keep you and your family in my prayers!"
523080,Gerry,2010-11-26 20:29:00,257,"Wayne, I just read this and I can only imagine what it's like to go through what your family is enduring right now. Life throws you a crappy hand sometimes. I sincerley hope that all goes well. It's important that Mom and Dad stay healthy too, daughter will need them....so take care of yourselves.  My thoughts will remain with you until she is cured.  Take care."
523095,irishfield,2010-11-26 21:42:00,26272,"Thanks Gerry.. I took a day for myself today.. slept in late, worked on some muskie gear. Back to reality tomorrow, but all a day at a time!"
523109,misfish,2010-11-26 22:33:00,29133,Bettys choking on her pop looking at that pic.   Keep us posted bud. Jens always in our thoughts and prayers.
523110,irishfield,2010-11-26 22:34:00,26272,Hey that was 2.5 years ago Brian.. I have less gut and more twit now !!

523140,irishfield,2010-11-26 23:55:00,26272,"Hear ya Brian!!  The sad part through all of this.. Friends I've made in the last few years here on OFC are seriously interested and concerned on a daily basis and for that I'm gratefull... others I've known for decades and decades, including some of Leah and I's family members, have gone underground. Guess it might be their way of dealing, but not what we or Jennifer needs during this."
526704,walleyemaster,2010-12-09 03:13:00,325,"Wayne..your daughter sounds like a real tough cookie and im sure she got that from you as well as your your wife.. im here for you wayne as much as i can be and im sure she will be just fine, with the determination she has shown and a great supportive family there is nothing but good that will result from this situation .. you and your family will only be stronger wayne and so will she...i will have your family in my prayers tonight wayne i promise you that..from one dad to another"
526709,irishfield,2010-12-09 03:24:00,26272,"Thanks Rob.. I knew this snow and ice crap would bring you out of the wood work sooner or later.  She's had a rough couple of weeks.. dropped from 90 lbs at weigh in the day (22nd Nov) of chemo start to 77 lbs 8 days later. Leah's got her fattened back up to about 85 lbs now and she's eating well again, so hopefully she'll get to 90 lbs again before Monday when her next chemo mix starts. She goes in Monday 13th Dec and doesn't get out until the Saturday.. then another $2700 anti-infection needle and then we'll be bringing her home for Christmas with the next scheduled chemo being January 3rd. Her PET scan showed the cancer has crept to her hip socket.. so surgery sounds definite now instead of maybe. When we don't know.. mid chemo or at the end to possibly remove part or all of her right pelvic bone and hip socket.  She went to work at Ryerson this afternoon... still waiting to hear from her tonight as to how that went. She wanted to get from last night to Sunday on her own.. so we dropped her off with plenty of food in the cupboards and left her to her wishes. We're back to TO Sunday noon... so her and her bf can use my truck to go to her bosses Christmas party in Aurora.. then Chemo the next morning and thru the whole week."
526741,Tarzan's Jane,2010-12-09 11:42:00,1183,"  Not nice stuff at all that you all are going through....many thoughts and talks to our Father going your way.  You have to be some proud parents, Jennifer is special no doubt about it.  When you share her fight and her determination I feel so much sadness and then I get goose bumps for I am struck by the ""soldier"" in her.  I find myself cheering her on.  You Go Girl....Just Keep Going"
526754,solopaddler,2010-12-09 12:37:00,8605," Your daughter is a beautiful young woman, and feisty too."
526764,bigbuck,2010-12-09 13:44:00,2449,You keep on trucking Wayne!!! Your daughter is battling this like a champ. You better plan some sort of special family event for next summer once this is finished with. Take your wife and Jen on a nice trip or do something REAL NICE for them. I'm praying for you guys.
526798,irishfield,2010-12-09 16:10:00,26272,"Thanks folks... she got to work.. worked 2 to 7.. went out with a co-worker to Jackassters for supper.. back to work for a couple hours and left for home at 10pm. Typing emails at 11pm and still pretty lively. Good to see she has some energy back and will be able to enjoy her OPSEU luncheon today at the Delta Chelsa.. and her Christmas party on Sunday, then back Monday for another cycle."

At this point we are covered staying in Jen's apartment just off Lansdowne with easy access to subway or a drive down college st to the hospital. If that changes I won't hesitate to call you, or a few of the other generous people here on OFC that have offered up accoms for us in the city.  Wayne"
520351,irishfield,2010-11-16 02:12:00,26272,"Today... Jen into Mount Sinai for 8am.. into a room by 9 only to be told that due to a mix up between Princess Margaret and Mount Sinai.. one having a file with Oshea on it and the other having one spelled properly.. creating a communication break down and she didn't have a necessary bench mark PET scan to start Chemo. A huge disappointment for her, after having a very restless night worrying about how this was all going to go down. Also told her portacath installation into her chest was too new to use today and that made her glad they weren't starting Chemo... if they had to try and find a vein.  We would have probably gone ballistic.. but she'll be seeing these same nurses and doctors for at minimum 7 months and no point getting on the wrong side of them.  GREAT news of the day to make up for the inconvienence of her booking the week off and us coming down to the city, they told her today that her bone marrow biopsy came back clear. At this point in time the Ewing's hasn't spread to her marrow. Now lets get his chemo going so it doesn't get a chance. Scan is hopefully going to be Friday and Chemo starts hell or high water NEXT Wednesday."

520381,Twocoda,2010-11-16 03:43:00,4130,wayne - once your daughter kicks the crap out of this latest adversity thats somehow found it way into your lives...the techies or docs that screwed up her first chemo better make sure she wasnt taking their names...from the sounds of her determination/will and fighting spirit ...this could be detrimental to their health..  father in law- 77 years old/ one year ago diagnosed with prostate cancer...full recovery and back to being a miserable ole man ...i wouldnt have it any other way...(well maybe some manners could have been secretly installed in him)  good friend 44 years old -  diagnosed with colon cancer roughly a little over a year ago ..they gave him a 5% chance at survival past 6 months....we just celebrated his 1 year anniversary  (Nov 3) and now they give him a 95% chance at FULL recovery... the thing he tells me that helped him through his rough times of chemo was the uncanny will to pay me the 5 bucks he owed me for betting against team canada in the last olympics hockey metal round...(im glad they didnt instill any more smarts in him)  Stay positive...it IS the key to success! and i will bark at the moon on your families behalf
520389,irishfield,2010-11-16 04:12:00,26272,"Thanks.. we're sitting here yaking.. Jen, Leah and I and just realized this is actually a good thing in some ways. If they stick to her three week schedule.. originally she was going to be in the hospital on the 27th of December. With a week delay now.. she'll be clear for Christmas/New years before going in for her 3rd treatment."
520406,solopaddler,2010-11-16 11:35:00,8605,"Thanks for the update Wayne, great news about the bone marrow biopsy."
520638,irishfield,2010-11-16 22:10:00,26272,"Thanks Mike!  ..and for those that think our health cares system is FREE... think again. Jennifer has to have a needle during (or after - not sure) each chemo treatment. Each needle is $2800 and it's not covered by OHIP !! .. so that's 10 x $2,800 = $28,000 !!! THANK GOD she is on full benefits working at Ryerson U or she'd be in serious debt (well not really.. I'd have a big dent in my wallet). She still has to pay for these up front though and submit her claim for reimbursement. Hope her credit card has at least a $6000 limit."
520649,misfish,2010-11-16 22:23:00,29133,"  Thats just total CRAP wayne. Ones that need it have to pay up front. This kind of crap pisses me of the most. Like going into a walk-in clinic,no wallet,sorry we need your card.  Thanks for nutt,n.   Jens got this one beat bud."
522460,irishfield,2010-11-23 05:21:00,26272,"Turns out it's a needle.. and I paid for that first $2800 today, that amongst other things made reality sink in really fast.  A LONG day for all involved, hitting the hosptial at 8am, with Jennifer having 4 different chemo's pushed in approximately a 1 hour period early this afternoon thru her portacath port. Can't imagine the feeling on the other side of that chemo.. but she was a trooper. Bravest 90 lbs I've ever seen..."
522463,bigugli,2010-11-23 05:37:00,6138,"Chemo is a nasty but often necessary evil. I know many who are very grateful survivors, thanks to the treatments. Your daughter sounds like a right stubborn cuss, and that's good. It helps stack the deck in her favor. There is still the promise of hope, and I truly wish the best for your daughter and your family. I know only too well how it feels to be a spectator while your child struggles and suffers. Try to look after yourself once in a while. It takes its toll on you."
522554,tb4me,2010-11-23 18:37:00,3295,"WOW irish. $2800, so what if she or you couldnt afford it? Surely they wouldnt just send the patient home without? NO?"
522571,irishfield,2010-11-23 23:51:00,26272,"It was actually $2697.97 for one needle with 6mg of this stuff in it !! There is also a $1000 version that is similar but not as good.. and it requires 10 needles to administer vs the single one Jen got. This drug helps fight infection that may be caused by chemo reactions and cell breakdown. I guess if you can't afford it or don't have insurance coverage then OHIP thinks multiple visits to Emerg are more cost effective!  She had a rough rough night.. but worked her way thru it mentally without being sick. Better today.. and we've got her back to her apartment as of 5pm, but I think the Mack truck ran her down somewhere along College St as she's out like a light."
522586,Headhunter,2010-11-24 18:46:00,5703,"The small ones are usually the toughest Wayne... you guys are in my thoughts daily... and as you know, the offer always stands... Thanks for keeping us up to date... keep me in mind if you need to get away for a bit, I'm only 10 minutes away... HH"

522591,misfish,2010-11-24 19:05:00,29133,"Thanks for the update on Jen, Wayne.  She,s one tough cookie."
522620,irishfield,2010-11-24 22:18:00,26272,"Thanks Guys..  Joe/Phil.. next chemo is Dec 13th and it goes for the whole week, provided she passes her blood test at 8am and her counts are okay. So we'll be looking for an outing or three I'm sure that week.  Not sure what's happening tomorrow other than I am going home for sure. I have to get a customers wings back on and airplane finished for Saturday. Leah's either staying behind or Jen is coming home with us. ""Chemo brain"" is a terrible thing..and she can't be left alone."
522628,mercman,2010-11-24 23:32:00,7054,"Hey Wayne.Not sure if you have heard of Craig Morgan.He is a country singer.He has a song out that reminds me of your daughters fight.Its called Tough.Here are the lyrics.I hope i dont offend.  Lyrics to Tough : She’s in the kitchen at the crack of dawn Bacon’s on, coffee’s strong Kids running wild, taking off their clothes If she’s a nervous wreck, well it never shows Takes one to football and one to dance Hits the Y for aerobics class Drops by the bank, stops at the store Has on a smile when I walk through the door The last to go to bed, she’ll be the first one up And I thought I was tough  Chorus She’s strong, pushes on, can’t slow her down She can take anything life dishes out There was a time Back before she was mine When I thought I was tough  We sat there five years ago The doctors let us know, the test showed She’d have to fight to live, I broke down and cried She held me and said it’s gonna be alright She wore that wig to church Pink ribbon pinned there on her shirt No room for fear, full of faith Hands held high singing Amazing Grace Never once complained, refusing to give up And I thought I was tough  Chorus She’s strong, pushes on, can’t slow her down She can take anything life dishes out There was a time Back before she was mine When I thought I was tough  She’s a gentle word, the sweetest kiss A velvet touch against my skin I’ve seen her cry, I’ve seen her break But in my eyes, she’ll always be strong  There was a time Back before she was mine When I thought I was tough [ Tough Lyrics on http://www.lyricsmania.com/ ]"

I applaud you for sharing such a personal event and how helpful it is to get support from family, friends and the OFC gang. I know from personal experience, ( I had basal cell carcinoma this summer), that the key to dealing with such an event is a POSITIVE ATTITUDE that we will beat this. Over the past few years, my wife has beat two different cancers with multiple surgerys, chemo, and radiation. Take it 'one day at a time', appreciate the little things and know you have our support.

If you're looking for good karma now Wayne, there's nothing else good enough other than a speedy and full recovery along with some lottery winnings and happily ever afters for Jennifer and you all.  Man, you and Leah have taken some beats since I've come to know yas.  Thank God though that ""knowing yas"" makes me feel Jennifer will pull through this one too.  She comes from good stock... Jenny will rock.  Bren and I will be thinking of yas."

I have been taught to keep my life in 24 hour compartments.  When I remember to do this, my day unfolds as it will and it is manageable.  When I don't remember to do this, I get wrapped up in fear of tomorrow and regrets from yesterday.  Another great lesson I learned when my wife and I were the Primary Caregivers for my mother in law ( Lou Gehrigs disease) was to ""take care of the care giver"". If the caregivers ( you and your wife and your daughter boyfriend) don't look after themselves, it will show it's ugly head very soon and usually in the most inopportune time and place.  I pray that you and your family are carried by the guiding creator in your life and that your daughters current challenge is met with courage and strength and dignity by all.  From my family to your, God be with you.  Sincerely,  Splashhopper"

I had to deal with the dreadful ""C"" this summer and they took care of me above and beyond all expectations.  I went in for a three and a half hour surgery that turned into a seven and a half hour one after they found more than the scans showed.  Three doctors cleaned me up and made sure I had nothing left instead of closing me up and going for lunch.  Most of the head doctors are teachers at U of T as well.  If they can't help your daughter, no one can.  I wish you and your family the best of luck.  Michael G. / King Salmon"

517805,I'mHooked,2010-11-05 18:29:00,525,Sorry for your family's pain right now. Make sure you do what you can to get her pulling those lakers through the ice this winter with you!
517616,irishfield,2010-11-05 03:48:00,26272,"We’ve been through a lot in this household in the last few years, but the last three weeks have been the longest in history. I’m hoping that some of the Karma that we’ve put out to others here on OFC comes back to pay us off ten fold.  Our daughter Jennifer, now 25 years old… the one that spent half her life suffering and then bravely beating her Crohn’s issues 2.5 years ago, with surgery, all while going to University and still managing to graduate with honours has a new battle on her plate to win. We’ve been tight lipped while she waited for answers and so she could tell her friends directly and not have them find out through the grape vine. That she has done late today.  Complaining the last ten months or so of joint pain and hip/leg issues, but still putting up with it and playing volleyball at Ryerson U twice a week despite the pain…. as she didn’t want to let her team down. Thought she had the family arthritis curse. Lots of physio, massage therapy, was even trying acupuncture…… but nothing but a handful of T3’s a day kept the pain dulled. Thankfully she lives downtown and she kept on the Doctors at St. Mike’s and after seeing a few doctors and having some Xrays they sent her for an MRI. She thought she was going in to see if she had Arthritis, so went alone to Toronto General for the MRI. Unfortunately the Dr. that sent her for the MRI had already seen something on an X-ray but didn’t bother to tell her or forewarn her. We talked to her pre-scan by phone and she was sitting in a hallway chair staring at a poster of Terry Fox. Odd she thought… then in for her full body MRI and out to the waiting room. Three Oncologists come out to tell her there’s a 90% chance that she has cancer in her right side pelvic bone.  She/we then wait a gruelling week to get into Mount Sinai for a biopsy a week ago Monday that will see her in for 3 days and then probably on crutches after they cut into her right hip. Support from my Brother and his wife and Jennifer’s boyfriend… all there to hold hands as we bring her in at 7:30 am…. not to see her again until late in the day, one of the longest we’ve ever sat through. Then even worse, we are told… “Surgeon and his team don’t do rounds until 7pm”!  Only thing they confirmed that Monday night at 7:20pm… she indeed had cancer, but the lab would have to confirm what it was. Two possible Sarcomas or Lymphoma. Late Wednesday night we were able to bring Jennifer all the way back home with us while she/we waited on results. So four nights here at home where we could keep an eye on her and then even though she’s on a total of 24mg of Hydromorphone a day… she wanted to go to work on Monday and we weren’t about to slow that determination down. As a test run I made her walk to the gate and back Sunday morning. That’s 1300 feet each way and she passed that test with shear determination. So work it was and Leah drove her back to the city and she put in her full day…. walking to the subway from her apartment and from the subway to work and then back again. Leah stayed two nights to be sure she was indeed okay and then came home.  Minutes before Leah walked in our door on Tuesday afternoon, they finally called Jennifer to advise her that she was one of the “(un)lucky” people out of the THIRTY or so that get diagnosed per year in Canada with Ewing’s Sarcoma / Bone Cancer vs the tens of thousands that get diagnosed with “normal” cancers. Wednesday morning she was to see the head of Medical Oncology at Mount Sinai and he was to give her the treatment protocol and to do another biopsy. This time drilling a hole in to the left side of her pelvic bone, to see if it’s spreading in her marrow.  A week this Monday, the 15th, Jennifer starts her Chemo. In on Monday and home Tuesday for the first kind of chemo mix. Three weeks later she goes in Monday and doesn’t get out until Saturday with the next chemo mix. This will continue for a total of 10 visits. 5 of the overnight chemos and 5 of the full week chemos, so she’s looking at minimum 7 months on Chemo and somewhere in the middle they will determine if they need to remove the/part of the right side of her pelvic bone and at the end do radiation treatments.  In between, being the trouper she is I suspect she’ll try to go to work, but there is no doubt that she’s going to miss lots of work in the next year. There will be lots of travel and parking fees for family etc while the experts at Mount Sinai keep our child alive. She has the In Chief as her surgeon, Dr. Wunder, and the head of Medical Oncology as her consulting Doctor, Dr. Blackstein. These two teach not only in Canada but all over the world, how can she/we go wrong with them. We are honoured that they took a look at her size, child like looks and these two heads of Oncology at Mount Sinai took her case on personally. They’ve told her that it’s currently localized and curable…we’ll go with that!  She’s in good spirits and eating and she needs to, considering the fact that she only weighs 96lbs thanks to her past Crohn’s issues. She gets her courage and drive from her mother that’s for sure!! It’s sure not from me and I’ll be the first to admit that.  I’m just sharing our life this week because it helps me mentally to type it out..… not trying to upset anyone else, nothing asked for in return, but some thoughts, prayers, howling at the moon or what ever it is you do.  Karma can be a wonderful thing I’ve found, and why when I’ve seen others here on the board in similar situations (that I may not even know) I do my part to try and help them out. It’s a reciprocal thing, or at least I’ve always hoped it was. I often wonder why our family is getting so beaten up over the last few years, but then I think back to what a little bugger I was in Sunday School at Trinity United! Paybacks are a b it ch.  I took pictures of her before and after her Crohn’s surgery and she beat that, so she asked me to do the same during this battle. Like I said she’s got a very positive attitude and will beat this monster! I lost my father to Cancer, oddly when I myself was 25 years old…. we WILL NOT lose our daughter.  Her she is going in for her biopsy… "
517617,Joey,2010-11-05 03:57:00,9122,"Yes Wayne, she is going to beat this.  As we've discussed recently, she is so strong willed and ahem, stubborn    that nothing can hold her back.  I have been and will continue to keep my positive thoughts coming her way.  I believe it is your parental caring that carries her through, as she has many of your attributes (poor girl   )  Did I mention stubborn  But in all seriousness, stay strong you two, you've certainly been through alot lately.  Joey"
517618,HTHM,2010-11-05 03:59:00,4082,"Wayne, I cannot imagine the stress you must be under right now. I'll keep you and your family in our prayers."
517619,irishfield,2010-11-05 04:06:00,26272,"Albert, talking with my step father today we agreed on one thing. For the first time we're actually glad my mother is gone and doesn't have to hear this news."
517620,Raf,2010-11-05 04:08:00,3495,She's in good hands and I'm sure all will be well Wayne.
517623,cram,2010-11-05 04:28:00,1733,"Really sorry.  Must seem terrifying, but it sounds like your daughter's a tough one...and attitude is a giant part of the battle."
517626,fishnsled,2010-11-05 05:01:00,3520,"Sounds like you have the best of the best taking care of your daughter and things will be fine. She is in great hands on the medical side and with all the love and support you and Leah have for her, it will be beat. Be strong and we here at OFC will be strong for you and the family as well.  You are in my thoughts and prayers.  Will"
517629,Tdel,2010-11-05 06:28:00,393,Our prayers are with you and your family Wayne. Prayers and a positive mind set can go a long way in defeating this disease. Jennifer certainly has the right attitude.  Tom
517630,camillj,2010-11-05 06:36:00,1988,Sorry for your pain Wayne - a huge dose of karma is surely coming your (and Jennifer's) way - you deserve it. There always a room for you here in the big smoke if you ever need it.
517631,pikehunter,2010-11-05 07:23:00,1659,"Sorry to hear the news Wayne. Fingers are crossed, prayers are in. Hope for all the best and for everyone to keep their spirits high and a continuing good positive attitude."
517633,spincast,2010-11-05 09:13:00,3279,"Wayne - if paybacks are 10 fold - the freindship and support you have shown around here will give you and your family enough Karma to knock this thing right out of the ball park. Know that best wishes and thoughts are sent to you and your family from ours. This scourge cancer touches too many -it  seems weekly now that someone I know has this devastating news. The only good thing is, especially where you have doctors of the calibre supporting your case, the outcomes now are so much more positive than when we were 25. With the grit and determination obvious in your famliy and the thoughts of all your friends  on the board and from other places I am confident you and your family will perserve and succeed."
517634,Terry,2010-11-05 09:16:00,14456,"I can not imagine what you are going through but there is hope...""They’ve told her that it’s currently localized and curable…"" and that's enough good news to hold on to  and we are all pulling for her Our thoughts and prayers are with you....."
517635,ChrisK,2010-11-05 09:42:00,2772,Sorry to here Wayne. She's young and strong and has the strong will to succeed.I'm sure she'll be fine...
517636,Rich Clemens,2010-11-05 09:53:00,3131,"Appreciate you sharing this Wayne, I was kinda thinking something was going on up your way.  Patsy and I will keep her (and all of you) in our prayers.  She has weathered storms for quite a while now and there's no reason to believe she won't prevail through this one either.  These kids are tough and determined - that alone goes a long way.  Keep us posted my friends."

517638,Tarzan's Jane,2010-11-05 10:22:00,1183,Sorry to hear this ...  I am upset for all of you.  Bloody hell....life can be so cruel.  I believe Jennifer has been through quite enough.  Makes no sense. Prayer is powerful but I would also like to help monetarily...you know for whatever Wayne. Is there a PO Box or a bank account that I could drop off a little something to help.
517643,mercman,2010-11-05 11:12:00,7054,"Hi Wayne.I will have her in my thoughts for sure.She sounds like a trouper, and i'm sure her strength and your supprt will carry her through this.  Paul"
517644,Fisherman,2010-11-05 11:12:00,7201,"This is usually the first board I read in the morning and definitely not something anyone wants to read or hear of.  Sincerely hope the powers to be can help her win the fight on this one, hang in there Wayne, there's hope."
517648,Sandbag,2010-11-05 11:20:00,533,Wayne.....My thoughts and prayers are with your beautiful daughter and the rest of your family.  Cheers  Craig

If you have an address that we can send cards of well wishes to Jennifer I am sure we can help support her in the times of low spirits and adversity. I know that this has been tough on both Leah and yourself and hope that you can draw strength from all of us and make it thru this current issue without harming your health or mental integrity.  With deepest sympathy  Art
