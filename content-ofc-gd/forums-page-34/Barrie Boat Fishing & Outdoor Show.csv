I’ll be presenting seminars at 11 AM & 5 PM today! I hope to see lots of folks out!  	There wI’ll be some other great seminars & exhibits as well, including Troy Landry from Swamp People! Choot’em!

1056215,Fisherman,2020-02-09 16:11:00,7201,"Well made the effort to go, got there at 10, no line up.  Nice show, really impressed with the Stanley line of boats.  If I was a bunch younger I would definitely lean towards buying one of them.  Craziest priced item,  a slightly oversized floating cedar picnic table, $2999.  Not something you can load into your truck and take to the beach for a day."
1056230,David Chong,2020-02-10 01:03:00,836,It was a very busy show! There were great crowds for the seminars and Troy Landry was a hoot! Fun times!
