1056515,DanD,2020-02-19 13:47:00,2223,Forgot I took this short vid. It's not much but shows our set up. My brother has had those tip ups for decades; couldn't count the number of fish they have caught over the years. Dan 
1056517,cisco,2020-02-19 15:10:00,597,Very interesting and skilled workmanship of all kinds going on there! Just proves again that trip preparation can also be allot of fun and all part of the adventure.
1056519,Terry,2020-02-19 15:25:00,14456,Looks good yeah chains on bare ice work well. Chains on deep snow not so good they dig in just bare  tires work better. And skis work a lot better
1056545,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-20 17:10:00,10439,Dan Be sure to post some good pics of your skis. I'm building a permy ice hut out of an old popup camper and want to put skis on it. I've got a pretty good idea what I'm going to do but more ideas are always good.
1056553,DanD,2020-02-20 20:33:00,2223,"Here are a few pics of the skies I built for the fish hut/old sled. My first attempt was to make them about the width of a ladder; actually the frame was from a ladder. LOL My thinking was the width would keep the hut on top of the snow; Yea it did but the drag was way to much; even with the ladder rungs covered with light weight sheet metal. Before I built the hut I was just using them on a sled behind the ski-doo and it pulled like I had a 10 ton load.  When I built the hut with the lowering axles; I knew a had to lessen the drag of the skies. Hut lowered to the frame. At this point the wheels can be lifted (by hand) high enough to put the skies under the wheels. Once skies were in place, winch the hut's springs down and raise the hut.  Hut raised for towing, down the road or out on the ice. Decided on these and so far they have worked pretty good. Gets the hut up off the snow and the narrow rails are no where's near as hard to pull.  Going to redesign the skies that I used on my 3' X 4' tag along trailer; to become Sally's new drive-on skies for the front.. Going to lower the back, so I can drive Sally's front tires into them and then ratchet strap then together?  The curved portion of both set of skies are actually trailer fenders, turned upside down to create pockets for the tires to sit in. Dan."
1056581,Sinker,2020-02-21 15:04:00,8692,Pretty cool stuff. Its just so much gear to drag around. My snowmobile and otter hut is much easier to deal with lol. S.
1056589,DanD,2020-02-21 19:31:00,2223,"Yea but do you have a warm place to drive out with, (Sally's heater works great) a warm up shack that you can strip down to a tee shirt in, 110 volts (generator) to power up engine block heaters or the microwave oven to warm your meals,  a BBQ and camp stove to cook meals? With this rig  I can use my permanent ""Blue"" fish hut as a base camp. Now I can use Sally and Bob (sled) and be mobile. Find an area I want to fish and then move base camp. Yes a lot of work, then what maybe needed to fish; but I also enjoy being comfortable, doing so. Shane. You will always be welcome In my fish hut, warm up shack or Sally! I like the way you speak your mind. Even as demented as it is. LOL You've helped me in the past!!!! Dan."
1056591,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-21 19:45:00,8243,Back in the 80's a co worker turned his full size van into an ice fishing machine. Holes in the floor and chains on the tires. Nice and warm and I didn't have to go out side.  Pretty simple. And he could drive it to Florida.
1056604,GBW,2020-02-21 23:25:00,8460,"I have to ask, where is/was he planning to ice fish in FLA?!?!??"
1056606,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-22 00:23:00,8243,One of the drive through liquor and beer stores. I love those joints. One I know of near where our Condo was even sells live bait. Only in America.
1056630,Sinker,2020-02-22 14:15:00,8692,"I think its cool as can be, just not for me. I like to keep things simple and effective, and have the least amount of things to worry about, and deal with.  Thats all. I love seeing the rigging of others, everyone has their thing. You clearly have the skills and means to produce the rigging, so all the power to you. Also, I'm always around if you need a hand. You have my number. Hopefully we will cross paths out there this year. The fish have been chomping real good so far. I'm still on weekdays, so if your out on a tues/wed, don't be afraid to reach out. Lori and I had a 31 whitefish day last week, it was nuts! S."
1056048,DanD,2020-02-04 20:32:00,2223,Thanks Terry. Once everything’s buttoned up; I can start playing with adjustments. Already thinking about cutting a round out of the trailing axle’s coil springs. Those Toyota rear struts only will compress by about 2 inches and then start lifting Sally’s ass end up.  	Dan.
1056053,misfish,2020-02-04 21:12:00,29133,"It,s a beast Dan . I would look onto something Terry did with the ski,s. I welded side shields on them so they cupped the side walls. Terry I am sure has some good pic,s of the set up. The front end will float and steer easy."
1056057,irishfield,2020-02-04 21:49:00,26272,
1056070,DanD,2020-02-05 00:35:00,2223,Not sure Sally would fit in with all though classics; but I’d put her up against them. LOL THANKS! Dan.
1056259,Fisherman,2020-02-11 18:10:00,7201,Coming to a lake near you. https://www.facebook.com/ManShedOfficial/photos/a.1227096864019698/1351450911584292/?type=3&eid=ARC7jBOc4MH4riXSPsukLKc5pfKjj7-aANQw1AtVSttOwIv2-Iu0Hq8lN_eG1Cq4CW48sLrlGGqWtUcL&__xts__[0]=68.ARAULAmiVuBWimrTLoTWua_-H-EH_eWGca7XxQpzgJCGBM1GcojE9Xp8roKBPh5cj9qEAH_-xvur4Wu2uuh5iM6iJtrQxBhx_0sWbfEvNnDwnQISdbldThJaJL8oP8ke57j1K1j7ERndSJjeU5neLRHF5eGwPQ9XRsR7rtivW0Wly1hMrKIBmVgJDdN5ZujrEV6dNRMvxDsHVVWCUbuGFnnwKMtDPJAqzxtAGCqDlqlNLZKpgA8RNovgWymOHmoiJvhjqM0gD0uOJuxQJ3JbgLaeUsSab-7_e048zeK-yy7yTi3KkSErenrn5IsM-EtISTLoZ1P3rUnMIxSsANwDR47aVAN-i6FCR0lVJs_ki4VAaJ57-g&__tn__=EEHH-R
1056260,misfish,2020-02-11 18:57:00,29133,I for one would not be a shamed to own that . LOL
1056349,DanD,2020-02-13 12:00:00,2223,With the bit of snow we had on the weekend I was able to get Sally out to the back lot here at the shop. Driving through foot + deep snow banks wasn't an issue. Then I tried climbing a 3-4 foot pile that the snow plow left. Got 3/4 the way over and the now wet tires started to spin inside the tracks. So back to the drawing board and came up with these cleats.  One side is about an 1/8 inch down to grab onto the tire. The other side is about a 1/4 inch to dig into the ice. Had a few minutes to put the chains on the quad; so it's read to go as the back up vehicle if Sally craps out?  We're going to look like the Nipissing Hillbillies have come to town. LOL  Even Rosco my basset hound is ready to go; but my wife says I can't take him with?  Dan.
1056397,DanD,2020-02-14 20:47:00,2223,"Heading out tomorrow morning for Nipissing. All loaded up, fueled up and crossing fingers that we're ready to go? Also hoping that the MTO has a bit of forgiveness. Maximum width is a 102 inches, the trailer is legal but the skies of the bobsled measure 109"". Oops officer I didn't realize , I had 7 more inches then I thought I had? (I could only wish) LOL  Anyway we're off later tonight and will let the cards fall where they will.  Dan."
1056398,lew,2020-02-14 21:07:00,12766,"Have a great trip Dan, it'll be good to hear how  you & Sally make out up there."
1056399,Terry,2020-02-14 21:10:00,14456,Good luck
1056400,ketchenany,2020-02-14 21:15:00,3229,"Have a good trip Dan, looks like a moon trip!"
1056401,Fisherman,2020-02-14 21:49:00,7201,We will want a video of your trip.
1056402,ketchenany,2020-02-14 22:05:00,3229,"No worries about the 7 inches, the OPP won’t believe what they see going down the road anyway.  	My  cousins drove to a moose hunt with a full size freezer on their trailer hooked to a Genny."
1056406,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-15 03:46:00,8243,"A while back I saw an episode of "" Restoration Garage"" and Grainger, the owner of the shop north of Newmarket, had a Model A ot T set up for the snow and ice. I had never seen a single one in my 65 years of travel. Now I see a line up of them, cooler than the ice they drive on. Dan I don't want to see the road kill after you run something over under those tires. Nothing like fresh ground Ground Hog."
1056410,OhioFisherman,2020-02-15 13:45:00,6623,"No idea how tough your cops are there, here the state highway patrol and most local police departments would have an issue with over width or over height vehicles. Good luck!"
1056420,Big Cliff,2020-02-15 22:29:00,6899,I  for one am anxiously awaiting a report for the maiden trip. 😀
1056421,misfish,2020-02-15 22:41:00,29133,I would be more worried about the over hang on the back. Good luck.
1056456,J Roelofsen,2020-02-17 02:52:00,84,"Just pulled into the motel in North Bay and instantly recognized the vehicle 😄 looks like fun.....I was getting some looks bombing across the lake today in my Subaru stuffed with big A/T tires lol. Dude's getting stuck with 4x4 pickups as I floated over the crusty snow 😁 Lotsa fish caught today, not a keeper in the bunch tho.... Josh"
1056488,DanD,2020-02-18 17:42:00,2223,"First off, it was good meeting you Josh. We didn't have a lot of time to talk; but it was pretty neat meeting another Londoner and board member!!! Lakeshore Suits was just as porkpie said it was. Lots of parking for the vehicles and trailer. The rooms are not fancy but very clean, big and super warm. When we got to the Lakeshore suits we drove by looking for Sunset park. It was less then a mile away; with very easy access to the lake. Went back to the suits and asked if we could unload and leave the trailer there. ""NO problem just park it there and you'll be good"". Every nice people running the place. Unloaded the trailer, hooked Bob and Sally together and off we went; down Lakeshore to Sunset park. Wasn't sure if we were legal driving on the street; but a cop went by giving us a thumbs up? It's North Bay and he knew what we were doing; I guess? Sally and Bob worked like they were meant to be. On the hard packed snow close to shore, I left Sally in high range and she pulled Bob easily in first gear.  Once we started into some deeper snow I had to switch to low range and when the engine revs were right, shift into second gear. What a little trooper she was; start into a snow drift, you could hear the RPM starting to drop. Stick my foot into the throttle and she'd dig down through the snow. When the track's cleats hit the ice, she just started pushing forwards and through. We did get stuck once, I didn't see that the drift was that deep. When the snow came up over the top of the front bumper and the front wheels broke through the hard crust the tracks were just spinning in air. Pulled the winch out, connected it to the rear of Bob. Drilled a hole in the ice and set the anchor Pulled ourselves out and off we went again. About a 15 minute deal to get moving again. The fishing was slow; but we did get a number of keeper Walleye and a couple dozen or so of jumbo perch. There was a pressure crack that we didn't want to cross that kept us away from the water depths I wanted (25-30 feet); but we made due.  We were about  1 1/2 miles out to the crack and the Manitou  islands were another 2 miles. Would have liked being in that 20 to 30 FOW  between the crack and the islands. Even with the 45 Klm winds we were able to stay warm inside Bob with the buddy heater going. We also put a wind break tarp up between Sally and Bob that helped a lot keeping us sheltered. Only took a couple of pics; to frigging cold and my phone didn't like it?    "
1056489,AKRISONER,2020-02-18 18:00:00,5558,I’m so happy to see that thing eat some snow
1056494,Big Cliff,2020-02-18 20:44:00,6899,"You just made my day, that's exactly the report I was hoping to hear! 🤗"
1056497,misfish,2020-02-18 22:01:00,29133,"So do you think skis on the front tires might be a better deal Dan ? In those pics, the front end looks like it would plow.  Thanks for the feed back on your maiden journey ."
1056505,porkpie,2020-02-19 00:30:00,2521,"Looking good Dan, glad it all worked out.  If you got a couple of keepers you done good!"
1056511,DanD,2020-02-19 12:38:00,2223,yea I think that Sally will be getting a new pair of shoes; a set of drive on skies. Wanted to try the chains and I think they'll still be better on bare ice for steering. But I dob't think we would have got stuck on that crusted over snow back if she had skies on? Instead of the front tires breaking through; I think Sally would have stayed on top and floated over. OK I'm stubborn and wanted to try it my way first. LOL Dan.
1056512,lew,2020-02-19 12:43:00,12766,"Good to hear your 1st trip was 99% successful Dan, you put a lot of work into that rig."
1055283,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-20 20:09:00,8243,"It not only won't fall apart if you build it Sally will be overbuilt if I have learned anything about you Dan. You will have a running prototype when you are finished. Then onto Dragon's Den. There is a market for a sled on anabolic steroids, for those that have snow and ice on the ground at least. Those ice fishing guys will do anything to get to the fish, anything. I wonder if Sally would qualify to run on public snow machine trails? It isn't a truck, it isn't a traditional snow mobile, way smaller then a Bombardier. What is it? The Burgermiester says it's a Frankensled!! Ooops, forgot to wish you a very belated Birthday old man. You are catching up to me. In a few years the Government feels so bad that you are old they give you a few bucks every month. Enough to go to dinner at The Keg a few times, maybe, and that's about it after they take their pound of flesh out."
1055285,DanD,2020-01-20 20:41:00,2223,"Looky what I got today. LOL  Had to first transfer Sally into my name, in an unfit ownership and pay the tax on her. Then a had to write and sign a letter of decalration; listing all the changes made to convert her into an off road vehicle. Test fitting the tracks for the first time. It all looks loose and sloppy right now; I still need to build the trailing arms that attach the differential tubes to the trailing axle. At least now I can get the measurements I need."
1055291,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-20 21:23:00,10439,Looks like there may need to be a little work with a body saw.
1055292,Terry,2020-01-20 21:29:00,14456,Looking great. So is the back tires  position permanent or is it adjustable   On mine I put the track on then adjust the distance of the rear axle  till I get the right tension
1055293,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-20 21:31:00,8243,"I remember watching an episode of The Guild Garage. They were trying to get the tracks on a old Model A Ford, made back then for the ice. They realized to get them on and tight they had to let air out of the tires, put the track on and refill the tires with air. Hope that may help, it worked 100 yrs. ago. So simple it's stupid."
1055299,DanD,2020-01-20 22:17:00,2223,Saws all make quick work of the offending body panels. The rear trailing axle will be fully adjustable. I’ll be able to take the idler wheels all the way up to touch the drive wheels. It’ll also have left & right track adjusters/tensioners. Yes simple once people see it finished; old tech is sometimes the best. Dan.
1055304,Terry,2020-01-20 22:27:00,14456,Nice
1055321,irishfield,2020-01-21 02:47:00,26272,"Hey.. when can I book in for a tune up, shop looks pretty backed up with employees cutting lumber and such! 😄"
1055322,jjcanoe,2020-01-21 03:30:00,744,Looking like it's going to rule the ice soon enough Dan!
1055359,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 21:06:00,5558,jesus...feed that thing some damn ice would ya! its like a caged lion!
1055365,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-21 22:05:00,8243,"Once you are finished the mechanics a nice wrap of something resembling various scenes of ice in various shades of blues and whites would be cool, a coulauge , even some scenes of guys icefishing. The sunsets we saw when the orange Sun dipped behind the bridge at Deseronto is something I will never forget. Cool not meant to be a pun."
1055383,Terry,2020-01-21 23:29:00,14456,Looks a lot like mine   I used a 10” turf tire yours looks much smaller  
1055394,DanD,2020-01-22 01:16:00,2223,Great minds!!! We’ll need to set up a drag/terrain race? LOL Dam.
1055398,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-22 02:27:00,8243,Mount 50 cals on those things and you guys have your own military division. Great work as well Terry. Dan what did the MOT title your machine as?
1055408,DanD,2020-01-22 11:25:00,2223,It's still classed as a 93 Suzuki; but they left the model blank. Dan.
1055988,DanD,2020-02-03 12:54:00,2223,"A little further with the sled. Got it pre-wired for the generator and the 110 electrical plugs; for things like engine block heaters, battery charger and extra lighting when we want it. Squirted some paint on it yesterday.That flat area in front of the topper is an escape hatch. If the rear of the sled ever went through and blocked the door from opening.  Sally is about done as well. Need to finish the trailing axle suspension and she should be ready to go? May need to go to Nipissing to test it; considering Simcoe is still to sketchy for my liking; plus Sally's extra weight that she put on. Dan. "
1055990,AKRISONER,2020-02-03 14:24:00,5558,you are going to start getting calls from the military to build these things. You do a better job than bombardier
1055991,porkpie,2020-02-03 14:31:00,2521,Looking good Dan!
1055993,Terry,2020-02-03 14:52:00,14456,Damn that’s looking good
1055997,GBW,2020-02-03 16:58:00,8460,"Oh man Dan, that thing is looking SO GOOD!  Nice work!"
1056002,BillM,2020-02-03 19:08:00,17367,This thing is bad ass!
1056027,DanD,2020-02-04 14:23:00,2223,Sally's still not completely finished but I had to try her out. It shouldn't be choppy a ride after I cut the bolts flush with the cleats.  Dan. 
1056045,Headhunter,2020-02-04 19:07:00,5703,"Thinker boxing here... it looks to me like the front end of Sally is lower than the back. I have to wonder if being like that will be driving the front end into the snow? Have you at all considered raising the front end to balance out the body. Again, not experienced, just thinker boxing.... she sure does look great though! HH"
1056046,DanD,2020-02-04 19:36:00,2223,Not sure what it's going to do? The front end isn't any lower then from the stock position; the rear is approx 2 inches higher then stock. There's also a set of chains going on the front wheels. The bottom of the front hitch receiver is about 18 inches high. Any deeper snow then that; I had better keep my ass home. LOL Dan.
1056047,Terry,2020-02-04 20:20:00,14456,"I assume it’s because of the bolts too high but I had trouble with mine when I had the shock on the back axle too tight ,pushing the back axle down too much. And if I put too much tension on the tracks I found thing started to wear out way to fast  getting a good tension on the tracks makes a big difference"
1054990,DanD,2020-01-14 17:26:00,2223,"Need some advice here; hoping someone has been through this? Went to service Ontario to transfer Sally into my name and have it re-registered as a UTV ((Utility Task Vehicle) and get off road plates for it. The lady behind the counter looked like a deer in the headlights. She had no idea of what or how to do this. I explained that I am turning this vehicle from an SUV to an UTV and it will never see the roads again. Still nothing but dead silence from her. Maybe if I were using the proper termanalogy might help; but I think my request was strait forwad? I hacked off the bits I didn't need for the road, added the bits I needed for off road. It is now a rebuilt/repurposed vehicle; what's the confusion? Dan"
1054994,ketchenany,2020-01-14 22:24:00,3229,Show her this and tell her the horse will be replaced with Sally! 
1054996,DanD,2020-01-14 23:39:00,2223,I actually went to a service Ontario this afternoon and they took my info and said they’d call me when/if they had an answer for me.  	come on people I’m not doing anything illegal; I want to be legal and property register this thing for off road use.

1054998,DanD,2020-01-14 23:52:00,2223,Got a bit more done on Bob (sled). A coat of paint and the puck board attached to the bottom of the skies. 3/4” puck board does not like to bend easily; not without a lot of heat. Thought I was going to burn out my heat gun. but it seems to have worked out?  Dan.
1054999,DanD,2020-01-15 00:16:00,2223,Sorry for posting 3?times in a row; but wanted to share this. A birthday card from my daughter.  Yep 60 a few days ago.  	Dan.
1055005,OhioFisherman,2020-01-15 10:35:00,6623,"Dan, that plastic you are calling "" puck board "", is that cutting board plastic? and isn't it prone to breaking in cold temperatures?"
1055030,AKRISONER,2020-01-15 22:02:00,5558,Dan do us all a favour and dont educate the ministry too much. When i bought my boat i went to register it and it became completely obvious no one had ever registered a boat at the dufferin road location in the last 50 years. They made me pay a bit of tax on the trailer registration and I was out the door for $120 with plates!
1055035,irishfield,2020-01-15 23:27:00,26272,Service Ontario does not register boats!
1055042,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-16 01:47:00,8243,"There are people on jobs that know more than their co workers, usually more than their supervisors. I would have asked the poor woman with all due respect can she ask someone for advice? When I think now about what I didn't know at 25 when I was handed the keys to an operation with a lost revenue of $4000.00 a minute and everything that came with that I start to have an anxiety attack. My managers must have been feeling the same at home. If I had have known the $$$ then I might have tapped out."
1055060,DanD,2020-01-16 11:20:00,2223,"This stuff is High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and it should hold up to the cold. Plus the stuff I'm using is 3/4"" thick; time will tell? Dan"
1055076,OhioFisherman,2020-01-16 15:53:00,6623,"Just wondering Dan, I used to be able to get plastic drums from customers and keep a few in the garage or barn with the tops cut off and store dry kindling  in them for my wood stove, some of them would break easily in very cold weather."

1055082,FILTHY OAR,2020-01-16 19:57:00,65,"I guess your boat is not registered yet then, the ON boat # will still be registered to the old owner."
1055088,AKRISONER,2020-01-16 21:59:00,5558,The registration slip with my name on it says it is? Also registered it with transport canada too  
1055091,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-16 22:16:00,8243,"Yep, they probably had never registered a boat there Akrisoner. Boats titles and registration is a Federal thing and your trailer is provincial, the MOT. You paid taxes on the trailer. I am going to sign my boat over to a friend and I'm told I can't just go to Service Canada and do it everything has to be done online now. I'll find out soon I guess. That location must have been a 2 for 1 special, Service Canada and MOT all in the same kiosk. Too simple to be true."
1055162,FILTHY OAR,2020-01-17 18:03:00,65,"Then you havn't received the tax bill yet for the boat from the government, 7 years ago when I registered mine I got the tax bill 2 years later. "
1055163,DanD,2020-01-17 18:21:00,2223,"Started assembling the tracks, now that all the treads are cut, drilled and the wheel guides are welded up. The treads are 1”x1/2”x14” long channel. The guides are 1”x1/8” flat bar, bent to form a rounded triangle.  All bolted together with 5/16” bolts, nuts and washers. Once everything is together and has proven to work the way I hope; I’ll cut the excess bolt length off and tack weld the nuts to cut the bolts. The rubber strips that the treads are bolted to, are from an industrial conveyor belt that use to haul rock out of a  quarry. It’s about a 1/4” thick with multiple layers of canvas and rubber. All I can say is that I picked a good winter to build this contraption; because there’s no ice on Simcoe that I’m willing to get out on. Which gives me more time to finish up. LOL This rig may take its maiden voyage out on Nipissing? Dan."
1055168,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-17 18:52:00,8243,"Dan, how much $$ do you think you will have in the rig by the time you finish? You have to include a decent labour rate, not the $130.00 you guys charge as shop rate. OK maybe not a buck 30. She sure is looking good and by the time you finish will have the only one in the entire World. That in itself is cool."
1055178,DanD,2020-01-17 21:22:00,2223,"You know what Johm, I have yet added up the costs so far; other then what the wife knows about. LOL I've been thinking about doing something like this for a few years now; so what the hell; lets build it. LOL If it's a flop I guess I won't build another; or at least not the same way? If it does work as plamed, I think we'll have some fun with it; umtil it blows apart. Believe me all of this has been built on a budget, of calling in favors and using used materials.Sally doesn't mimd used undergear as long as its been cleaned, freshly welded (She has steel drawers) and painted. LOL Dan."
1055180,Sinker,2020-01-17 21:42:00,8692,Simcoe will be fully good to go by the 25th. Ya better get movin! See you out there! S.

1055271,DanD,2020-01-20 17:06:00,2223,"The tracks are all but done; still need to do the final tightening of the treads, once I've mounted them on Sally. I started putting the trailing axle together, got as far as welding the stubs onto the axle and had to stop. The guys got here to help build the box for the bobsled.   With the snow that came down on the weekend, I was able to run the sled around the parking lot here at the shop. The thing towed like it wasn't there. Left the quad in high range and 2 wheel drive; it didn't even spin the tires. At about 15 klicks per hour, I made a right turn around the end of the building; looked over my left shoulder to find the sled at about a 45° swung out to the left. The puck board has made the skies that slippery. Put 2 rows of bench seats in, a truck topper on top, squirt some paint on and it'll be done. Dan."

1053851,AKRISONER,2019-12-18 15:45:00,5558,Dan is literally building a Home made tank...where are you looking to source the turret cannon dan?
1053853,DanD,2019-12-18 16:45:00,2223,Great idea! I have a potato cannon; just have to find it. LOL I wonder how much trouble I could get into?  Second thought I may just leave sleeping dogs lay. LOL Dan.
1054235,jjcanoe,2019-12-29 02:03:00,744,Thanks Dan! 
1054271,DanD,2019-12-30 12:38:00,2223,"Took a break from working on Sally and started building a bobsled or my smitty on roids. LOL It's based on the design of an old horse drawn sled; that the loggers used back in the day.  The front & rear skies will turn via a set of pivots below the deck. The cross chains you see in the schematic; makes for front & rear steering. As you would turn to the right, the front skies follow right; but rear skies would turn out left. Allowing both sets of skies to follow the same arch and not be dragged sideways on a sharp turn. I've got the ski and ski frame welded up and the 5X8 foot deck frame. Still need to install the turntables (pivoits) and the draw bar. Once that's done, I'll get my brother in-law out here to build the wooden enclosure, on top of the deck frame.  This last pic shows the approx position of the turn tables. Two plates for each set of skies. One plate welded to the ski frame and the other to the deck frame. Then the two plates bolted together, in the center with a single 1 inch (diam) bolt. Also found a 4X8 sheet of 3/4"" thick puck board (Kijiji) that I'll cut four 3"" strips from and attach them to the bottom of the skies. I know it looks heavy; but with the beating this thing will get; anything lighter (smaller) than 1"" tubing would be junk first trip out. Dan."

1054462,DanD,2020-01-02 20:53:00,2223,"LOL@ Sinker and misfish. There’s been so many times that I’ve seen walkers red faced, exhausted and cold. My old set up I couldn’t pick them up; no room in my pull behind sled.  Plus I hated packing and unpacking the crap we take out every weekend. Now I’ll have room for both. Met so many nice people last season by inviting them into the hut for a warm up and a cup of instant soup. One guy crashed in the hut with me for the night. He was planning to walk back out the next day. The next time I went out to the hut (a week later) there was a 40 pounder stuck in the snow bank by the door. LOL Dan. "

1054524,Sinker,2020-01-03 22:18:00,8692,"Yep, I could see that happening. I could also see that sleigh getting you buried LOL.....What do you think it weighs?  You're going to want to make sure that the trails are wide enough for it where you want to go too. I know, on the lake you will be fine, but other places you could have problems, like trails getting to the lake etc.  The issue I see is if you did get stuck, as hard as it may be, that sleigh will be a monster to unhook and move by hand. That's why wood is the way to go. Wood also flexes, instead of being rigid. Heres one we built to haul logs. Hauled hundreds of cords out of the bush with this sleigh with a 250 elan, then upgraded the machine to a yamaha V540. Its crazy how much weight you can load on that sleigh, and still have control of it. I'm not saying theres anything wrong with your sleigh, just offering some advice from experiences I've had pulling heavy things in snow and across lakes. S.  "
1054603,DanD,2020-01-06 13:22:00,2223,"I figure about 250 -275 lbs. Not planning on doing any bushwacking or trail running. If (which I likely will) get stuck; the winch should get me going again. Also planning on quick connects for the winch at both ends of Sally and the sled. Pop a hole in the ice, drop down my Ice anchor and out we come.  Had to do that quite a bit, when pulling the hut with the quad. A single line 2000lb winch, was able to pull the hut and quad out of a foot deep slush. The new winch is a 4500lb with a wireless remote.   All said and done, it wouldn't be the first time that I had to say ""I should have done this"" when I was finished building something. LOL Dan."
1054710,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-08 22:01:00,10439,"Dan, you should put a 1/4"" UHMW disk between the two turntables. I used UHMW disks on my komatik's hitch to keep things tight but smooth."
1054739,Sinker,2020-01-09 14:19:00,8692,"At least a 1/4"" thick. The discs on the sleigh I posted above are 5/8"" and we replace them every couple years. Hard to see them as they are painted, but they are there, top and bottom"
1054740,Sinker,2020-01-09 14:20:00,8692,That's a lot of heavy kit to haul around.  Too much for me. I don't even have a trailer heavy enough to get it to the lake LOL..... S.
1054789,DanD,2020-01-10 12:10:00,2223,Go big son or go home. LOL I blame my Dad for the way I am; he always over packed but we never did without. Maybe I shouldn't say this on a fishing board; but the fishing (catching) is secondary to the adventure of being out with the people I enjoy being with. I was going to put a disk of HDPE (Puck board) between but decided to go with old fashion donkey crap (grease) and put in a couple of zerk fittings on the bottom ofeach disk.   I've widened the width between the rear wheels of Sally by welding two rims together. Now the 14 inch wide track has all the body clearance it needed.  Going to start putting the track together this weekend. I have all the 14 inch long channel/cleats cut. 4 Lengths 13 feet long of 4 inch wide conveyor belt cut and decided on the design of the guides to hold the tracks true to the wheels. I'm just wondering how far North I'm going to have to go to find some ice to try this rig out on? Dan.
1054790,DanD,2020-01-10 12:20:00,2223,Oh yeah. If you ever need to borrow a trailer; just let me know? LOL Dan.

First few pics I thought your trailer deck was welded to the ski's already.  I couldn't figure out how you where going to steer the sleigh!  But now I see that you just had it sitting on the ski's!  I no longer doubt your ingenuity!
1054799,DanD,2020-01-10 13:31:00,2223,"The front wheels/tires should run about 3 inches on the inside of the rear track's foot print. Shouldn't be an issue, with the front tires having chains on. If anything it'll give the fish hut an or the sled more packed down area for their skies to follow on? Dan. "
1054806,NAW,2020-01-10 15:41:00,4022,"When I built my sleigh, I made the runners match my exact centers of my skis on my snowmobile.  I think it helps..   But im towing with a yamy bravo, and not an SUV with tracks!!  So every little bit helps me, when it comes to getting through slush pits!  "

Yesterday was slow here in the shop, so I decided to attach the winch mount and get that out of the way. Ho yeah Sally's name sake, comes from my wife's Aunt Sally. An 80+ year old lady, that's rough and tough; but will never let you down. Hopefully the Sidekick lives up to its name sake. LOL The winch mount is actually a class 3 hitch receiver that came off of a Dodge Caravan. Cut off the the brackets that were not needed. Flipped the receiver upside down and welded it to the frame horns and the bumper's re-bar. Dan. "

I have tire chains for the front wheels already and have locked (weld spider gears) the rear differential. So I might get away with 4 wheel chains?  	I’ll post up dates as they come along for anyone interested.  	Dan.

Going to a buddies hoarding pile tomorrow. He thinks he may have what I want.  	If money were not an issue; this project would be said and done.

When you see more than a few late 80's vehicles still on the road the proof is in the pudding and many of those Suzuki's are still on the road. The bodies give out far before the drive train . Another example are mid to late 80's GMC Sierra's and Chevy  short box stepsides, plenty still on the road. I might suggest looking at one of those old Bombadier 1/2 tracks they use on Nippising. No need to re invent the wheel. On that whacky Newfie TV show ""Last Chance Garage"" they did something with an old beater similar to what you want to do. Good choice with the Suzuki Dan."
