1056515,DanD,2020-02-19 13:47:00,2223,Forgot I took this short vid. It's not much but shows¬†our set up. My brother has had those tip ups for decades; couldn't count the number of fish they have caught over the years. Dan 
1056517,cisco,2020-02-19 15:10:00,597,Very interesting and skilled workmanship of all kinds going on there! Just proves again that trip preparation can also be¬†allot of fun and all part of the adventure.
1056519,Terry,2020-02-19 15:25:00,14456,Looks good yeah chains on bare¬†ice work well. Chains¬†on deep¬†snow not so good they dig in just bare ¬†tires work better. And skis work a¬†lot better
1056545,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-20 17:10:00,10439,Dan Be sure to post some good pics of your skis. I'm building a permy ice hut out of an old popup camper and want to put skis on it. I've got a pretty good idea what I'm going to do but more ideas are always good.
1056553,DanD,2020-02-20 20:33:00,2223,"Here are a few pics of the skies I built for the fish hut/old sled. My first attempt was to make them about the width of a ladder; actually the frame was from a ladder. LOL¬†My thinking was the width would keep the hut on top of the snow; Yea it did but the drag was way to much; even with the ladder rungs covered with light weight sheet metal. Before I built the hut I was¬†just using them on a sled behind the ski-doo and it pulled like I had a 10 ton load.  When I built the hut with the lowering axles; I knew a had to lessen the drag of the skies. Hut lowered to the frame. At this point the wheels can be lifted (by hand)¬†high enough to put the skies under the wheels. Once skies were in place, winch the hut's springs down and raise the hut.  Hut raised for towing, down the road or out on the ice. Decided on these and so far they have worked pretty good. Gets the hut up off the snow and the narrow rails are¬†no where's near as hard to pull.  Going to redesign the¬†skies that I used on¬†my 3' X 4' tag along trailer; to become Sally's new drive-on skies for the front.. Going to lower the back, so I can drive Sally's front tires into them and then ratchet strap then together?  The curved portion of both set of skies are actually trailer fenders, turned upside down to create pockets for the tires to sit in. Dan."
1056581,Sinker,2020-02-21 15:04:00,8692,Pretty cool stuff. Its just so much gear to drag around. My snowmobile and otter hut is much easier to deal with lol. S.
1056589,DanD,2020-02-21 19:31:00,2223,"Yea but do you¬†have a warm place to drive out with, (Sally's heater works great) a warm up shack that you can strip down to a tee shirt in, 110 volts (generator) to power up engine block heaters or the microwave oven¬†to warm your meals,¬† a BBQ and camp stove to cook¬†meals? With this rig¬† I can use my permanent ""Blue""¬†fish hut as a base camp. Now¬†I can use Sally and Bob (sled) and be mobile. Find an area I want to fish and then move base camp. Yes a lot of¬†work, then what maybe needed to fish; but I also enjoy being comfortable, doing so. Shane. You will always be welcome In my fish hut, warm up shack¬†or Sally! I like the way you speak your mind. Even as demented as it is. LOL You've helped me in the past!!!! Dan."
1056591,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-21 19:45:00,8243,Back in the 80's a co worker turned his full size van into an ice fishing machine. Holes in the floor and chains on the tires. Nice and warm and I didn't have to go out side.¬† Pretty simple. And he could drive it to Florida.
1056604,GBW,2020-02-21 23:25:00,8460,"I have to ask, where is/was he planning to ice fish in FLA?!?!??"
1056606,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-22 00:23:00,8243,One of the drive through liquor and beer stores. I love those joints. One I know of near where our Condo was even sells live bait. Only in America.
1056630,Sinker,2020-02-22 14:15:00,8692,"I think its cool as can be, just not for me. I like to keep things simple and effective, and have the least amount of things to worry about, and deal with.¬† Thats all. I love seeing the rigging of others, everyone has their thing. You clearly have the skills and means to produce the rigging, so all the power to you. Also, I'm always around if you need a hand. You have my number. Hopefully we will cross paths out there this year. The fish have been chomping real good so far. I'm still on weekdays, so if your out on a tues/wed, don't be afraid to reach out. Lori and I had a 31 whitefish day last week, it was nuts! S."
1056048,DanD,2020-02-04 20:32:00,2223,Thanks Terry. Once everything‚Äôs buttoned up; I can start playing with adjustments. Already thinking¬†about cutting a round out of the trailing axle‚Äôs coil springs. Those Toyota rear struts only will compress by about 2 inches and then start lifting Sally‚Äôs ass end up.¬† 	Dan.
1056053,misfish,2020-02-04 21:12:00,29133,"It,s a beast Dan . I would look onto something Terry did with the ski,s. I welded side shields on them so they cupped the side walls. Terry I am sure has some good pic,s of the set up. The front end will float and steer easy."
1056057,irishfield,2020-02-04 21:49:00,26272,
1056070,DanD,2020-02-05 00:35:00,2223,Not sure Sally would fit in with all though classics; but I‚Äôd put her up against them. LOL THANKS! Dan.

1056260,misfish,2020-02-11 18:57:00,29133,I for one would not be a shamed to own that . LOL
1056349,DanD,2020-02-13 12:00:00,2223,With the bit of snow we had on the weekend I was able to get Sally out to the back lot here at the shop. Driving through foot + deep snow banks wasn't an issue. Then I tried climbing a 3-4 foot pile that the snow plow left. Got 3/4 the way over and the now wet tires started to spin inside the tracks. So back to the drawing board and came up with these cleats.  One side is about an 1/8 inch down to grab onto the tire. The other side is about a 1/4 inch to dig into the ice. Had a few minutes to put the chains on the quad; so it's read to go as the back up vehicle if Sally craps out?  We're going to look like the Nipissing¬†Hillbillies have come to town. LOL  Even Rosco my basset hound is ready to go; but my wife says I can't take him with?  Dan.
1056397,DanD,2020-02-14 20:47:00,2223,"Heading out tomorrow morning for Nipissing. All loaded up, fueled up and crossing fingers that we're ready to go? Also¬†hoping that the MTO has a bit of forgiveness. Maximum width is¬†a 102 inches, the trailer is legal but the skies of the bobsled measure 109"". Oops officer I didn't realize , I had 7 more inches then I thought I had? (I could only wish) LOL¬† Anyway we're off later tonight and will let the cards fall where they¬†will.  Dan."
1056398,lew,2020-02-14 21:07:00,12766,"Have a great trip Dan, it'll be good to hear how¬† you & Sally make out¬†up there."
1056399,Terry,2020-02-14 21:10:00,14456,Good luck
1056400,ketchenany,2020-02-14 21:15:00,3229,"Have a good trip Dan, looks like a moon trip!"
1056401,Fisherman,2020-02-14 21:49:00,7201,We will want a video of your trip.
1056402,ketchenany,2020-02-14 22:05:00,3229,"No worries about the 7 inches,¬†the OPP won‚Äôt believe what they see going down the road anyway.¬† 	My ¬†cousins drove¬†to a moose hunt with a full size freezer on their trailer hooked to a Genny."
1056406,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-15 03:46:00,8243,"A while back I saw an episode of "" Restoration Garage"" and Grainger, the owner of the shop north of Newmarket, had a Model A ot T set up for the snow and ice. I had never seen a single one in my 65 years of travel. Now I see a line up of them, cooler than the ice they drive on. Dan I don't want to see the road kill after you run something over under those tires. Nothing like fresh ground Ground Hog."
1056410,OhioFisherman,2020-02-15 13:45:00,6623,"No idea how tough your cops are there, here the state highway patrol and most local police departments would have an issue with over width or over height vehicles. Good luck!"
1056420,Big Cliff,2020-02-15 22:29:00,6899,I¬† for one am anxiously awaiting a report for the maiden trip. üòÄ
1056421,misfish,2020-02-15 22:41:00,29133,I would be more worried about the over hang on the back. Good luck.
1056456,J Roelofsen,2020-02-17 02:52:00,84,"Just pulled into the motel in North Bay and instantly recognized the vehicle üòÑ looks like fun.....I was getting some looks bombing across the lake today in my Subaru stuffed with big A/T tires lol. Dude's getting stuck with 4x4 pickups as I floated over the crusty snow üòÅ Lotsa fish caught today, not a keeper in the bunch tho.... Josh"
1056488,DanD,2020-02-18 17:42:00,2223,"First off, it was good meeting you Josh.¬†We didn't have a lot of time to talk; but it was pretty neat meeting another Londoner and board member!!! Lakeshore Suits was just as porkpie said it was. Lots of parking for the vehicles and trailer. The rooms are not fancy but very clean, big and super warm. When we got to the Lakeshore suits we drove by looking for Sunset park. It was less then a mile away; with very easy access to the lake. Went back to the suits and asked if we could unload and leave the trailer there. ""NO problem just park it there and you'll be good"". Every nice people running the place. Unloaded the trailer, hooked Bob and Sally together and off we went; down Lakeshore to Sunset park. Wasn't sure if we were legal driving on the street; but a cop went by giving us a thumbs up? It's North Bay and he knew what we were doing; I guess? Sally and Bob worked like they were meant to be. On the hard packed snow close to shore, I left Sally in high range and she pulled Bob easily in first gear.¬† Once we started into some deeper snow I had to switch to low range and when the engine revs were right, shift into second gear. What a little trooper she was; start into a snow drift, you could hear the RPM starting to drop. Stick my foot into the throttle and she'd dig down through the snow. When the track's cleats hit the ice, she just started pushing forwards and through. We did get stuck once, I didn't see that the drift was that deep. When the snow came up over the top of the front bumper and the front wheels broke through the hard crust the tracks were just spinning in air. Pulled the winch out, connected it to the rear of Bob. Drilled¬†a hole in the ice and set the anchor Pulled ourselves out and off we went again. About a 15 minute deal to¬†get moving again. The fishing was slow; but we did get a number of keeper Walleye and a couple dozen or so of jumbo perch. There was a pressure crack that we didn't want to cross that kept us away from the water depths I wanted (25-30 feet); but we made due.¬† We¬†were about¬† 1 1/2 miles out to the crack and the Manitou¬† islands were another 2 miles. Would have liked being in that 20 to 30 FOW¬† between the crack and the islands. Even with the 45 Klm winds we were able to stay warm inside Bob with the buddy heater going. We also put¬†a wind break tarp up¬†between Sally and Bob that helped a lot keeping us sheltered. Only took a couple of pics; to frigging cold and my phone didn't like it?    "
1056489,AKRISONER,2020-02-18 18:00:00,5558,I‚Äôm so happy to see that thing eat some snow
1056494,Big Cliff,2020-02-18 20:44:00,6899,"You just made my day, that's exactly the report I was hoping to hear! ü§ó"
1056497,misfish,2020-02-18 22:01:00,29133,"So do you think skis on the front tires might be a better deal Dan ? In those pics, the front end looks like it would plow.  Thanks for the feed back on your maiden journey ."
1056505,porkpie,2020-02-19 00:30:00,2521,"Looking good Dan, glad it all worked out. ¬†If you got a couple of keepers you done good!"
1056511,DanD,2020-02-19 12:38:00,2223,yea I think that Sally will be getting a new pair of shoes; a set of drive on skies. Wanted to try the chains and I think they'll still be better on bare ice for steering. But I dob't think we would have got stuck on that crusted over snow back if she had skies on? Instead of the front tires breaking through; I think Sally would have stayed on top and floated over. OK I'm stubborn and wanted to try¬†it my way first. LOL Dan.
1056512,lew,2020-02-19 12:43:00,12766,"Good to hear your 1st trip was 99% successful Dan, you put a lot of work into that rig."
1055283,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-20 20:09:00,8243,"It not only won't fall apart if you build it Sally will be overbuilt if I have learned anything about you Dan. You will have a running prototype when you are finished. Then onto Dragon's Den. There is a market for a sled on anabolic steroids, for those that have snow and ice on the ground at least. Those ice fishing guys will do anything to get to the fish, anything. I wonder if Sally would qualify to run on public snow machine trails? It isn't a truck, it isn't a traditional snow mobile, way smaller then a Bombardier. What is it? The Burgermiester says it's a Frankensled!! Ooops, forgot to wish you a very belated Birthday old man. You are catching up to me. In a few years the Government feels so bad that you are old they give you a few bucks every month. Enough to go to dinner at The Keg a few times, maybe, and that's about it after they take their pound of flesh out."
1055285,DanD,2020-01-20 20:41:00,2223,"Looky what I got today. LOL  Had to first transfer Sally into my name, in an unfit ownership and pay the tax on her. Then a had to write and sign a letter¬†of decalration; listing all the changes made to convert her into an off road vehicle. Test fitting the tracks for the first time. It all looks loose and sloppy right now; I still need to build the trailing arms that¬†attach the differential tubes to the trailing axle. At least now I can get the measurements I need."
1055291,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-20 21:23:00,10439,Looks like there may need to be a little work with a body saw.
1055292,Terry,2020-01-20 21:29:00,14456,Looking great. So is¬†the back tires ¬†position permanent or is it adjustable ¬† On¬†mine I put the track on then adjust the distance of the rear axle ¬†till I get the right tension
1055293,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-20 21:31:00,8243,"I remember watching an episode of The Guild Garage. They were trying to get the tracks on a old Model A Ford, made back then for the ice. They realized to get them on and tight they had to let air out of the tires, put the track on and refill the tires with air. Hope that may help, it worked 100 yrs. ago. So simple it's stupid."
1055299,DanD,2020-01-20 22:17:00,2223,Saws all make quick work of the offending body panels. The rear trailing axle will be fully adjustable. I‚Äôll be able to take the idler wheels¬†all the way up to touch the drive wheels. It‚Äôll also have left & right track adjusters/tensioners. Yes simple once people see it finished; old tech is sometimes the best. Dan.
1055304,Terry,2020-01-20 22:27:00,14456,Nice
1055321,irishfield,2020-01-21 02:47:00,26272,"Hey.. when can I book in for a tune up, shop looks pretty backed up with employees cutting lumber and such!¬†üòÑ"
1055322,jjcanoe,2020-01-21 03:30:00,744,Looking like it's going to rule the ice soon enough Dan!
1055359,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 21:06:00,5558,jesus...feed that thing some damn ice would ya! its like a caged lion!
1055365,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-21 22:05:00,8243,"Once you are finished the mechanics a nice wrap of something resembling various scenes of ice in various shades of blues and whites would be cool, a coulauge , even some scenes of guys icefishing. The sunsets we saw when the orange Sun dipped behind the bridge at Deseronto is something I will never forget. Cool not meant to be a pun."
1055383,Terry,2020-01-21 23:29:00,14456,Looks a lot like mine ¬† I used a 10‚Äù turf tire yours looks much smaller  
1055394,DanD,2020-01-22 01:16:00,2223,Great minds!!! We‚Äôll need to set up a drag/terrain race? LOL Dam.
1055398,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-22 02:27:00,8243,Mount 50 cals on those things and you guys have your own military division. Great work as well Terry. Dan what did the MOT title your machine as?
1055408,DanD,2020-01-22 11:25:00,2223,It's still classed as a 93 Suzuki; but they left the model blank. Dan.
1055988,DanD,2020-02-03 12:54:00,2223,"A little further with the sled. Got it pre-wired for the generator and the 110 electrical plugs; for things like engine block heaters, battery charger and extra lighting when we want it. Squirted some paint on it yesterday.That flat area in front of the topper is an escape hatch. If the rear of the sled ever went through and blocked the door from opening.  Sally is about done as well. Need to finish the trailing axle suspension and she should be ready to go? May need to go to Nipissing to test it; considering Simcoe is still to sketchy for my liking; plus¬†Sally's extra weight that she put on. Dan. "
1055990,AKRISONER,2020-02-03 14:24:00,5558,you are going to start getting calls from the military to build these things. You do a better job than bombardier
1055991,porkpie,2020-02-03 14:31:00,2521,Looking good Dan!
1055993,Terry,2020-02-03 14:52:00,14456,Damn that‚Äôs looking good
1055997,GBW,2020-02-03 16:58:00,8460,"Oh man Dan, that thing is looking SO GOOD!¬† Nice work!"
1056002,BillM,2020-02-03 19:08:00,17367,This thing is bad ass!
1056027,DanD,2020-02-04 14:23:00,2223,Sally's still not completely finished but I had to try her out. It shouldn't be¬†choppy a ride after I cut the bolts flush with the cleats.  Dan. 
1056045,Headhunter,2020-02-04 19:07:00,5703,"Thinker boxing here... it looks to me like the front end of Sally is lower than the back. I have to wonder if being like that will be driving the front end into the snow? Have you at all considered raising the front end to balance out the body. Again, not experienced, just thinker boxing.... she sure does look great though! HH"
1056046,DanD,2020-02-04 19:36:00,2223,Not sure what it's going to do? The front end isn't any lower then from the stock position; the rear is approx 2¬†inches higher then stock. There's also a set of chains going on the front wheels. The bottom of the front hitch receiver is about 18 inches high. Any deeper snow then that; I had better keep my ass home. LOL Dan.
1056047,Terry,2020-02-04 20:20:00,14456,"I assume it‚Äôs because of the bolts too high but I had trouble with mine when I had the shock on the back axle too tight ,pushing the back axle down too much. And if I put too much tension on the tracks I found thing started to wear out way to fast ¬†getting a good tension on the tracks makes a big difference"
1054990,DanD,2020-01-14 17:26:00,2223,"Need some advice here; hoping someone has been through this? Went to service Ontario to transfer Sally into my name and have it re-registered as a UTV ((Utility Task Vehicle) and get off road plates for it. The lady behind the counter looked like a deer in the headlights. She had no idea of what or how to do this. I explained that I am turning this vehicle from an SUV to an UTV and it will never see the roads again. Still nothing but dead silence from her. Maybe if I were using the proper termanalogy might help; but I think my request was strait forwad? I hacked off the bits I didn't¬†need for the road, added the bits I needed for off road. It is now¬†a rebuilt/repurposed vehicle;¬†what's the confusion? Dan"
1054994,ketchenany,2020-01-14 22:24:00,3229,Show her this and tell her the horse will be replaced with Sally!

1055005,OhioFisherman,2020-01-15 10:35:00,6623,"Dan, that plastic you are calling "" puck board "", is that cutting board plastic? and isn't it prone to breaking in cold temperatures?"
1055030,AKRISONER,2020-01-15 22:02:00,5558,Dan do us all a favour and dont educate the ministry too much. When i bought my boat i went to register it and it became completely obvious no one had ever registered a boat at the dufferin road location in the last 50 years. They made me pay a bit of tax on the trailer registration and I was out the door for $120 with plates!
1055035,irishfield,2020-01-15 23:27:00,26272,Service Ontario does not register boats!
1055042,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-16 01:47:00,8243,"There are people on jobs that know more than their co workers, usually more than their supervisors.

When I think now about what I didn't know at 25 when I was handed the keys to an operation with a lost revenue of $4000.00 a minute and everything that came with that I start to have an anxiety attack. My managers must have been feeling the same at home. If I had have known the $$$ then I might have tapped out."

Boats titles and registration is a Federal thing and your trailer is provincial, the MOT. You paid taxes on the trailer. I am going to sign my boat over to a friend and I'm told I can't just go to Service Canada and do it everything has to be done online now. I'll find out soon I guess. That location must have been a 2 for 1 special, Service Canada and MOT all in the same kiosk. Too simple to be true."

LOL It's based on the design of an¬†old horse drawn sled;¬†that the loggers used back in the day.  The front & rear skies will turn via a set of pivots below the deck. The cross chains you see in the schematic; makes for¬†front & rear steering. As you would turn to the right, the front skies follow right; but¬†rear skies would turn out left. Allowing both sets of skies to follow the same arch and not be dragged sideways on a sharp turn. I've got the ski and ski frame welded up and the 5X8 foot deck frame. Still need to install the turntables (pivoits) and the draw bar. Once that's done, I'll get my brother in-law out here to build the wooden enclosure, on top of the deck frame.  This last pic shows the approx position of the turn tables. Two plates for each set of skies. One plate welded to the ski frame and the other to the deck frame. Then the two plates¬†bolted together, in the center with a single 1 inch (diam) bolt. Also found a 4X8 sheet of 3/4"" thick puck board (Kijiji)¬†that I'll cut four¬†3"" strips from and attach them to the bottom of the skies. I know it looks heavy; but with the beating this thing will get; anything lighter (smaller) than 1"" tubing would be junk first trip out. Dan."

That's why wood is the way to go. Wood also flexes, instead of being rigid. Heres one we built to haul logs. Hauled hundreds of cords out of the bush with this sleigh with a 250 elan, then upgraded the machine to a yamaha V540. Its crazy how much weight you can load on that sleigh, and still have control of it.
