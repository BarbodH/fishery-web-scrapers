1056338,huey graphite,2020-02-13 03:54:00,362,I have a relative in the scrap removal business who gave me this old level wind reel. Apparently it'sÂ  circa 1930.

Reels were pretty cheap back then compared to today's prices, and that one looks to be on the lower end of the pricing scale."
1056347,dave524,2020-02-13 11:24:00,4508,"Not a match to the paperwork , that reel looks low end as Ohio said , I grew up with direct drive knuckle busters, Langley's and Inglis/Shakespeares mostly."
