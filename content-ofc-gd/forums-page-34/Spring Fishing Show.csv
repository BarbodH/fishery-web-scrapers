1056466,captpierre,2020-02-17 19:41:00,2521,Last time I went was pretty disappointed. This  year’s show improved IMO. Lots to see. Lots of big and small tackle venders. Bought this big Muskie net with deep basket for the big girls. 
1056476,BillM,2020-02-17 23:29:00,17367,Nice!  Perfect laker net as well.
1056478,Musky Plug,2020-02-18 01:15:00,398,"Sweet net, which booth did you find that at? I was only able to spend couple hours there Saturday morning. Wasn't to busy then but got some pretty good Megabass stuff from Pro J’s and some other stuff from other vendors that my local places don’t have. Also chatted with the Oliver guy from BigBassDreams YouTube channel about musky fishing for a little bit. Seemed like a nice guy. I thought it was a decent show although I didn’t get to spend as much time as I wanted there."
1056480,captpierre,2020-02-18 01:41:00,2521,I didn’t see the name of the large booth. But he said he was from Belleville. Ranger Net.  $229. No Tax. Super long telescopic handle. Rubber coated mesh. Octagonal handle that won’t spin. Easy to lock into place. I’ve been looking for a big deep basket net with a long handle. Capture a big fish and keep her in the water while resting the long handle across the gunnels of the boat Then unhook in net. This will help me and the fish especially fishing alone.
1056481,Musky Plug,2020-02-18 01:59:00,398,"Was it Pro Tackle? I saw the booth as I walked in but forgot to check it out before I left. Pretty good price for the net. I like the rubber coated mesh, that pretty sweet. Will definitely help when you’re by yourself."
1056490,KawarthaAngler,2020-02-18 19:59:00,273,I spent a couple hours walking the floor Monday and sat in on a couple of sessions.  I enjoyed my time and thought it was a good trip.
1056492,LostAnotherOne,2020-02-18 20:11:00,956,I do most of my fishing alone it and it is one of the most important things in my boat.  Caught a 40 inch pike a few years ago and it make the process so much easier.  She had a nice swim in the net lol.  Had her in it while I set up the tripod.  Just a good investment.  Good for you.
1056694,NILS Master Lures,2020-02-24 16:22:00,24,We thought it was a nice event! It was a our first time doing it and we met a lot of really nice people.
