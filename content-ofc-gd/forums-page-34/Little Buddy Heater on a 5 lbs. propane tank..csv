1056285,squirrel761,2020-02-12 14:17:00,30,Just finished hooking up my new Little Buddy Propane heater to a 5 lbs. tank. So easy to move around and doesn't take up a lot of space. Fired it up and it worked great. Better than hauling around a 20 lbs tank. Should be interesting to see how well it heats my insulated Otter pop up.  
1056286,TJQ,2020-02-12 14:20:00,7806,That should do a great job
1056289,AKRISONER,2020-02-12 15:20:00,5558,My buddy brought up a 10lber this past weekend it was the width of a regular tank but flat like a saucer. Such a good idea the 20lber I lug around is overkill. I don’t need to carry 2 fishing seasons worth of propane with me lol
1056294,LostAnotherOne,2020-02-12 16:35:00,956,lol
1056295,squirrel761,2020-02-12 17:11:00,30,Yah that's the thing I want to avoid. 20 lbs is overkill for me as I like to spend most of my time outside the hut :). Just like a spot to warm up when I need to.
1056299,AKRISONER,2020-02-12 18:08:00,5558,the only time the heater is on all day is when its actually way below zero and my dads fishing with me. I typically venture out until i get cold and then come back in as well.  Last saturday was the first day this year I even used the heater and ive been on the ice almost every weekend since the beginning of December! She was so damn cold though on saturday  evening when the sun went down that in the hut with the heat cranked my line was still icing up!

1056309,misfish,2020-02-12 21:21:00,29133,"Ya insulated for sure, but non, they are not the best, unless you have it under yer arse. Cool conversion"
1056320,David Chong,2020-02-12 23:34:00,836,Should work great in an insulated Otter! I was in a 4 man model last weekend with a regular Buddy Heater on a 5 lbs. Tank and you could crank it up like a sauna in there! LOL
