1056826,HTHM,2020-02-28 00:40:00,4082,Anyone?
1056832,Chuck Enwinde,2020-02-28 06:10:00,247,You could check out Moosehorn Lodge in Chapleau.  Nice cabins on a nice little lake with decent fishing.  Wawa area has a bunch of lodges that I'm sure could accommodate you.  I don't have experience with any of them but it's a fishy area - check out Whitefish lodge.
