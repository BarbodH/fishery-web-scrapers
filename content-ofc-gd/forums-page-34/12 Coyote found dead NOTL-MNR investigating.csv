1056404,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-15 03:29:00,8243,"From MNR (Ministry of Natural Resources) Watch. Art, move to other discussion page if necessary. NOTL is Niagara on the Lake. Thanks. JD. If always encourage outdoors persons to sign up. If any of you have not signed up for the MNR Watch newsletter I strongly suggest you do. They are not the MNR, they keep tabs on all MNR activities and send you an email. I am always interested in following the court trials of poachers and what penalties they are given once found guilty.Â  There a few great Judges and Justices of the Peace in central Ontario that have big books and throw them at guilty poachers as hard as some relief pitchers in the big leagues. They are female if that matters.. â€¦.........Maybe a coincidence? https://mnrwatch.com/ministry-investigating-coyote-carcasses-dumped-along-niagara-parkway/"
1056405,kickingfrog,2020-02-15 03:45:00,8333,"They clearly were not disposed of properly, but that might be the only offence. The coyote ""season"" forÂ WMU 88 where NOTL is open all year."
1056407,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-15 03:54:00,8243,"I realize that, same open season for them here in Haldimand-Norfolk. What does a hunter do with them after they are shot I wonder.? A farmer pal out here butchered one and boiled it to feed to his sled dogs. they hardly touched it.Â  DNA to close perhaps."
1056408,canoecarrier,2020-02-15 03:56:00,54,"I have been following thatÂ website for a couple of years, mnrwatch gets a small amount of info. I am sure 90% of MNR infoÂ goes under the radar. As far as the coyotes, they have been a huge issue recently everywhere. Seems like the personÂ Â tried to dispose of them somewhat, but not properly."
1056418,OhioFisherman,2020-02-15 20:47:00,6623,"I drove the Niagara Parkway from Fort Erie to the falls a fewÂ  times, no idea what is off the main road, but it didn't strike me as a hunting area."
1056422,dave524,2020-02-15 23:37:00,4508,Years ago we hunted behind Niagara Christian CollegeÂ  on the Parkway just north of the Marina at Millers Creek.
1056423,pics,2020-02-16 00:18:00,1268,Since they have an Open Season all year they were probably legally hunted but disposed of in an unethical manner..
1056424,dave524,2020-02-16 00:54:00,4508,"Just wait until cormorant season opens and a bag limit of 50 and you can let them rot, the press will have fun when a couple of guys dump a hundred cormorants and someone finds themÂ Â ðŸ¤¯"
1056426,cisco,2020-02-16 01:11:00,597,"Pelts take time and effort to remove, flesh out, stretch and need stretching boards, etc.. many guys haven't been taught how to do this. plus fur prices for such late season pelts aren't as good as early season and from western provinces. Coyotes are getting too numerous and they reproduce quickly to compensate for removed members and food availability.Â  IMO the MNR can't be bothered to get down the hill to them nor to take apart stinking carcasses to find out what death they experienced. There is little point in trying to find out anything further. No limit or bounty or meat wasted re coyote harvest around southern Ontario. All we shot got skinned but the carcasses were left in the bush around where we shot them. back to nature went the remains."
1056435,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-16 05:28:00,8243,"If you get into the Green Belt along the Niagara escarpment or take the trail, of which the name escapes me, (late and 65 yrs old! Google time,) it goes from The Falls to Tobenmory ON. You would think you were hikingÂ  in The Blue Mountains of Kentucky or Georgia or on that trail from Tennessee or Kentucky to Maine. Another name that I have buried somewhere in my thick scull. Appellation Trail, who rah!!! That jaunt on that Ontario trail you will see anything from Bald Eagles to Wolf and Black Bear. Not far from the millions of people that live mere miles from it. It's not that we get forgetful as we age it's like any computer system, when the RAM is full you need to delete some to get more new stuff stored in it. Pretty simple really."
1056447,cisco,2020-02-16 21:59:00,597,"Just back from Simcoe whitee huntin' and thought about another angle. If the hunters took the yotes to, say, a landfil,l they might be told 'no' and advised to go bury them or take them someplace else like a rendering plant. I'm not sure if a landfill would take them. Also it may cause some civil servant there toÂ callÂ the police or MNR re the carcasses thus causingÂ allot of undue hassleÂ to the hunters. IMO the MNR when commenting on this issue could and should have provided advise on how to properly dispose of such critters. This as a public service since no doubt the hunters in this case along with others would like to know proper protocol.Â MNR fell flat on this one. Recall years ago when a moose hunter found the entire animal was filled with cysts and MNR said it's OK to eat. SURE!!! Hunter told me ""I took the whole works to the dump"". But again, these days a call might go out getting a hunter in trouble for this same thing."
1056654,richyb,2020-02-23 00:02:00,774,I wish someone would dump a dozen winter coyotes off at my door lol. Thats about $1000 at the auctions. I averaged $90 last year.
1056656,kickingfrog,2020-02-23 00:32:00,8333,"You get them up there? I make too much noise stomping around looking for grouse, but I've not even seen sign of them."
1056657,richyb,2020-02-23 00:54:00,774,Yes there are lots around .
1056661,cisco,2020-02-23 02:13:00,597,Not sure if 'carcasses' mean't skinned or unskinned. Article wasn't clear about that. Would probably take a bit of time to get that many. I can see a gang of huntersÂ who specialize hunting them keeping them froze out back until time to thaw a bit to skin all at once then draw straws on who gets to discard the remains. Lazy guy drew the short straw.
