1056529,can u fish,2020-02-20 01:10:00,326,Well the time has come for me to take my Grandson on his first ever fly in fishing trip i always promised him when he turned 10 i would take him along  i have been on many fly in trips over the last 19 years with many great outfitters through out the province that being said i decided to book a trip with Glassy Bay Outfitters  out of Elliot Lake they also operate Moose Territory Lodge out of Quebec we will be  flying into Middle Bark Lake Outpost Camp June 6th to the 13th For Walleye and Northerns  and  this will be a short drive from home to the air base only 3 1/2 hrs as i live 20 minutes North of Parry Sound any way just wondering  if anyone in the community here has dealt with this Outfitter if so how was your trip. Cheers Mitch

Thanks Andrew "
