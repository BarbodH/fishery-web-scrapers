Didnt expect them to go out and buy equipment so here is my humble attempt at making tip ups with whatever I could find around the house. Stuff used: Wood from old crate stool Paint mix sticks Wire hanger Leftover fishing line Rubber bands The only thing I bought for 6 bucks was the wire steel strapping.  Going to test it out this thursday for perch. Should work fine, I hope.   "

1056081,north560,2020-02-05 15:45:00,38,Looks good the only thing I would change would be to use an old bike tire tube instead of elastics. Nothing works better than simple.
