1055987,Garnet,2020-02-03 11:46:00,2056,Yes easily
1055999,BillM,2020-02-03 18:13:00,17367,"Yup, shouldn't be a problem."
1056011,Rizzo,2020-02-03 22:50:00,4754,doing some exploring...nice
1056020,kickingfrog,2020-02-04 00:45:00,8333,Thanks for the feedback. Looking to spend a week there this summer.
1056023,chris.brock,2020-02-04 06:59:00,4053,Canning Lake too
1056125,kickingfrog,2020-02-06 20:30:00,8333,Booked for the last week in July. Fun family time at the lake.
1056132,Pigeontroller,2020-02-06 23:58:00,2793,"Busy lake, but the narrows into Soyers makes that lake a bit quieter!"
1056137,chris.brock,2020-02-07 02:49:00,4053,"that's a good choice, yeah, it's a busy circus, but there's lots of water to explore and lots of other diversions nearby for family outings"
1056154,Fish Farmer,2020-02-07 17:10:00,2234,"GotÂ  2 nights booked for ice fishing the east part of Kash, Kashaga Lodge. Change of pace??? Anything I should know anybody, never fished it.???"
1056221,Tjames09,2020-02-09 16:59:00,664,"Can anyone tell me (you can pm me), if you can get from haliburton to Kash in winter, or does it not freeze under the bridge? It looks like head and grass connect to Kash, but not sure if it freezes."
1056229,chris.brock,2020-02-10 00:38:00,4053,"it doesn't freeze under the bridge and it doesn't freeze between Grass and Kash, there's too much current"
