1056454,captpierre,2020-02-17 00:23:00,2521,Going to try to get down to this area of Cuba early March. South shore. First time. Reviews are great for snorkeling off the beach and warmer water.  Has anybody done any shore fishing or taken a charter out?

You want to focus on casting from shore (beach or off some rocks), bridges, and piers. You can also troll off of catamarans or get them to take you to the reefs where you can go nuts on fish. I made quick video on that in November. "
1056485,Garnet,2020-02-18 12:09:00,2056,I was at Playa Pasquera  3 weeks ago. Plan your shore fishing around high tide charts are available. Mustard #2 stainless bait hooks where the best for shrimp and bread. I used spider thread to hold shrimp and bread on better. You will make many friends with 30lb mono. The Eagle brand from wal mart $3 bulk spool. I bought a 4 piece travel rod off Amazon 8 ft so each section 2 ft . I had a 5500 salt reel on it but a 4000 would be better. A selection of rubber core sinkers would have been nice. We trolled with paddleboat worked good .
