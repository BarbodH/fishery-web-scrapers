1056039,antonio77,2020-02-04 16:43:00,32,Hi everyone! Any ideas about good places for shore fishing and ice fishing around Parry Sound area? Planning a trip on the long weekend and need an advise. Thanks
1056042,AKRISONER,2020-02-04 18:00:00,5558,Lots of good fishing to be done. The sound itself isn’t safe and isn’t iced over
1056055,BillM,2020-02-04 21:24:00,17367,Inland lakes might have ice but the Sound?  Nope.
1056056,antonio77,2020-02-04 21:45:00,32,so most are open for fishing? The regulations are so complicated. But thank you guys
1056074,AKRISONER,2020-02-05 12:39:00,5558,you can fish any of the lakes around there https://www.ontario.ca/document/ontario-fishing-regulations-summary/fisheries-management-zone-15 From that page The following waterbodies have regulations that are very different from the Zone-wide season and limits and are only referred to in the waterbody exceptions:

1056144,BillM,2020-02-07 12:53:00,17367,"Not from shore,  shore fishing there is now banned due to the constant garbage spread all over the place."
1056145,BowSlayer101,2020-02-07 13:20:00,296,"Yeah I heard, so I assume no access onto the ice either? Man people suck."
1056150,BillM,2020-02-07 14:56:00,17367,Yeah no access to anything.   Brutal.   A few ruin it for everyone
1056156,antonio77,2020-02-07 19:58:00,32,Thank you so much to all!!! Hopefully will drive around the lakes inside and check my chance
1056157,pics,2020-02-07 20:24:00,1268,Watch the parking regs. The township of Georgian Bay to the south does not allow roadside parking and signage is minimal to non existent. You will get a ticket... I don't know if Parry Sound is the same..
1056171,BowSlayer101,2020-02-08 03:04:00,296,That’s brutal
