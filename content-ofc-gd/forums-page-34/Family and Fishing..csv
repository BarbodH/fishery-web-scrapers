Went out at stoopid O'clock solo and got a few fish then returned home. My son asked where I had been while he was bowling in the morning and when I told him he looked disappointed, I said we could go back after lunch....BIG SMILE. We took the fire pit and fished/messed around until dusk before coming home. Fishing was exactly that in the afternoon, I fished but caught nothing. Anyhoo, fun times for all in beautiful NW Ontario.  "
