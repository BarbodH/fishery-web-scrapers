1056393,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-14 16:03:00,8243,"Oh my goodness Paul. I would venture a guess if you had that car today the way it came out of the showroom you are conservatively looking at 40 to 50 grand. That's low balling it. I need to look on the Interweb for one for sale, if there is one in the World today. A few months ago we were listing the cars and trucks we once had. I am looking at about a million bananas if I had them today in new condition. Just my 72' TR-6 I bought new out of the showroom in grade 12 for $3600.00 is going for anywhere from 30 to 40K. An identical 69' 280SE Benz convertible I once had in 75' sold recently at Barrett Jackson for $75,000.00. There's over 130K CDN for 2 cars. I still have my 82' 560 SEC Mercedes with the AMG package stored in buddy's heated quancet hut, I think I still have it unless he sold it! He has around 75 classics and not so classic cars of all makes and models. He leases them to television and movie production companies for big bucks. Some do not have drive trains. My list is long, I had an eye for mostly European, not 1 American muscle car. Oops I'm wrong, had a 76' Stingray L-88, the last year Stingrays were offered. No regrets. Ooops again, sort of, 70' Camaro, had it for a week, threw a coat of paint on it (Mayco) and nearly doubled my $$$, but certainly not a muscle car with a silly 6 banger in it. It was pointed out to me the other day talking about car. vs truck towing and launching that the pre uni body frame  cars we have now were preceeded with full steel framed bodies of basically the same frames as our trucks are today."
1056395,Garnet,2020-02-14 17:17:00,2056,Lew  you could move that boat 1-2 inches back taking amazing amount of tongue weight off.
1056396,lew,2020-02-14 18:22:00,12766,Yes I knew that but it was a good excuse to buy a new truck  LOL I also didn't like the single axle trailer that came with the boat so I had a custom 2 axle trailer built in Michigan and it made a huge difference in the towing.
1056416,OhioFisherman,2020-02-15 20:35:00,6623,"John John, Dave, here all the big 3 auto companies had their own versions of the small block = big block thing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_small-block_engine Chevy and GMC trucks and vans shared the same engines, the 4 bolt main 350 was standard in them ordered with a 350, only seen in the high performance models of cars. I don't have any real idea of the customs problems of getting engines made here across the border, so it may have been possible that they used Chevy engines in other GM brands made there, like the Pontiacs. Most of the small block Chevy motors had a lot of interchangeable parts, intake manifolds, heads, crank, rods, they and aftermarket performance enhancing parts were readily available."
1056429,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-16 02:40:00,8243,I have brought a few cars from the US across the border like my Benz from The Auto Toy Store in Lauderdale I think in 91'. Duty and taxes were not that bad. Engines and such from any of the big 3 do not have duty as long as similar parts are produced here. Toyota and Nissan as well. Ticha's Nissan was built in Kentucky. I found out my brand new then 011' Chevy Silverado was build in Mexico. I wasn't too happy when I found that out. Maybe why I paid over 10K less than my next door neighbour Jim paid for his brand new similar F-150. Things get complicated these days. I can't wait to see our new deal with Mexico and your POTUS looks like. USMCA??????
1056433,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-16 04:04:00,10439,Toyota is moving Tacoma production from the Texas plant to Mexico. They are moving Sequoia production to Texas in it's place. This is so they can produce more Tundra's out of that plant.
1056434,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-16 05:04:00,8243,"Hi Drifter, Off topic of course but I found an obscure local TV station from South Western ON. a few months ago, CFTV. what a great little station, old movies, classic TV shows. Just the other day they had an old My Favorite Martian on in B&W followed by I Dream of Genie. Zero commercials, nada, nieti, niema, zitch. With this Interweb thing I'm sure you can get it. The reason I tell you this is that an old Clint Eastwood spaghetti western was on and guess what of all things he played? A DRIFTER that reluctantly saved the town from a band of Mexicana bandito's and desperado's. The Monkeys are on now. I did not know Peter Tork passed a few years ago. He had $$$. His Mom invented ""White Out."" So much for $$ when you are 6' down under, and that ain't a band from Australia. Ok back to real life. I thought there is or was a Toyota plant up Cambridge ON way. I know there was in fact as a pals wife commuted there from Hamilton in the 80's. Or was it Honda? Nope Toyota. Paul most all of the GM products I ever owned all had versions of the 350 CID engine. My Eldorado had a big block Caddy engine in it, 400 something. The thing wasn't close to 200 HP. My wife's little 4 banger in her light as a feather Kia Optima is something like 250 HP. Her 07' 3.5 LT Nissan Altima was close to 300HP. I don't think my 76' Corvette Stingray L-88 350 was close to 300 HP Google time. My 011' Silverado is a 5.7 LT/350 CID and I have no idea how many HP. I knew once, doesn't matter to me these days, not like 45 years ago. I'll tell you what though, when I push down on the right pedal you instantly know it's a V-8. A sound and something you will never hear or feel from a 4 or 6 banger no matter what the HP is. People ask me what mileage or how many liters I get per 100 KM's? I have no idea, it doesn't matter, when I need gas I put it in. That's the ride I chose. It's like the old saying if you had to worry about gas mileage in a Cadillac you can't afford one. If I was still commuting to my office in St. Kitts and I was summand to The Home Depot in London I got in the car and went. Then it mattered. Paul I did find a 64' Grand Prix on the internet that was close to your specs. It had a recent restoration numbers matching and they were asking $52,000.00. Only found 1 64' GP for sale. Johnny D/Selkirk ON."

1056326,outllaw,2020-02-13 00:44:00,1232,dad had a1953 Plymouth . slippery ramp. came back from getting bait. he was standing on the roof with an oar. was not happy. sold it after we dried it out lol.
1056328,misfish,2020-02-13 00:50:00,29133,"Growing up,pop always drove an econoline ford van. Pulled a large ceder built boat ."
1056331,BillM,2020-02-13 01:30:00,17367,I remember the oldman pulling the boat with a 76 Monte Carlo.
1056332,Rizzo,2020-02-13 01:41:00,4754,I used to launch a 14 foot Lowe side console with 25 hp Johnson with a Toyota Celica...had to go with proper paved launches though
1056337,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-13 02:29:00,8243,"Brian, I also had that van, a late 60's painted orange. Made it to Florida and back in 76'. 4 of us left Hamilton and I came back solo. That story is in the screenplay. My girlfriends Father didn't like it much, or me. Never got cold as the engine was about 10"" from your arse. Caught fire once waiting in line to cross the border to the US at the Queenston Lewiston bridge. The US Customs guy put it out with his fire extinguisher. I could have taken anything across the border that day. Brushed the girlfriends seat off and away we went to the Family Reunion. Stopping at K Mart and buying a fire extinguisher might have been an idea, or checking why it started fire in the 1st place, ya think? No way. The thing was unbreakable. There must have been a few ramp follies with folks launching and retrieving boats with family cars. Sounds like a few here have experience doing it. Man that must have been a fun day besides killing the car the bait was wasted."
1056341,OhioFisherman,2020-02-13 06:22:00,6623,"Dad had a 53 pontiac wagon, a 60 chevy wagon, a 65 pontiac wagon, a 68 chevy wagon, a 71 pontiac wagon, a 86 chevy wagon, all pulled boats,  aluminum, wood, and fiberglass."
1056345,dave524,2020-02-13 11:09:00,4508,"We'd go camping as a kid with a '64 Pontiac Wagon , loaded with gear, 14' Fibreglass with a 28hp out behind and a 16' canoe on top, 283 cu.in 8 cyl. with one of those 2 speed powerglide auto transmissions.  My personal tow vehicles were a 79 GMC Van with a 350 cu in. , a 88 Chevy pickup with a 4.3 V6 and a 97 Astro Van with the same 4.3 V6, boat was a little over a ton with gear, 18 1/2 foot tinner with a 90 v4., never felt the need for a 4x4 ."
1056346,fishindevil,2020-02-13 11:13:00,6254,had a few beast cars...71 pontiac pariseiane  as well as an 1988 oldsmobile broghm delta 88 big cars and they would pull just about anything also pulled a 16ft lund with a 1998 grand am...... lots of fun and got stuck at many boat ramps back in the day
1056348,lew,2020-02-13 11:44:00,12766,"Hard to see the station wagon on the edge of the picture but this is my Dad hooking up his 15' cedarstrip to his '53 Ford. Don't know if you can make it out or not but the boat didn't sit ON the trailer, it hung UNDER it. "
1056354,OhioFisherman,2020-02-13 13:04:00,6623,"Dave, unless Canada did their engine selection differently? As I recall the only engines offered in the full size Pontiac was a 389 or 421, the Tempest and Lemans had some smaller available engines. 64 GTO 389, single quad, 4 speed, I had one. "
1056361,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-13 17:27:00,10439,My first boat was a little tinny and I pulled it with a Camaro.
1056362,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-13 17:50:00,8243,"Pontiac's definitely had 350's in the 80's at least here they did. Mom and Dad had a 80's era Parisienne, complete with massive velour Barker loungers and Chesterfields doubling as interior seats. I think it  was a Bonneville in the States. The Lawrencian was called something else down your way Paul. Barker loungers and Chesterfields, can you tell I have dual citizenship?"
1056365,grimsbylander,2020-02-13 18:28:00,3016,"Most of the older vehicles were much heavier than the identical models offered today. Since towing is about the torque required to move the boat and the weight required to control the boat, it makes sense. I sure wouldn’t consider towing a big ‘ol 1974 glass boat with a 2020 Chevy Malibu at 25% lighter than the same car from that period and its 1.5L standard engine. It’s apples to oranges."
1056372,dave524,2020-02-13 20:24:00,4508,"Must have been different in Canada. we had both large and small block V-8's. In 64, there were 283 and 327's in small blocks, they increased them shortly after '64 to 305' and 350's.  My 79 GMC van had the 350 small block with the 4 barrel Quadrajet and 4 bolt mains, dad has a '79 pickup with the 305. In '64 full size Pontiacs had 3 trim levels, base was the Strato Chief, mid trim was the Laurentian and top was the Parisienne. Full size Chevs were Belair, Biscayne and Impala in that era. Big blocks I seem to recall 454's and 427's, maybe a 396 too. GM in St. Catharines made most of the engines for the Canadian market back then. Before the '64 wagon dad had a 61 Pontiac 4 door , think it had a 232 six."
1056373,misfish,2020-02-13 21:37:00,29133,Sweet ride Paul  Got a pic ? Got there quick I bet Dave
1056375,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-13 23:11:00,10439,NAH it was a late 90's 2.8 V6 4spd. It was the first and last Chevy I will ever own. Absolute junk it was. Engineered by retarded monkey's on crack!!!!
1056376,chris.brock,2020-02-14 00:20:00,4053,"When I was young, my Dad bought an older, full size Pontiac station wagon to use for banging our way into back lakes, lol. It had a 350, four barrel. I remember he liked getting his foot into it on the road and hearing the roar. The floor was rusted with holes, so we had to keep the windows cracked for the fumes from the beat up, loud exhaust hanging from coat hangers. There was 2x4s on the roof to carry the boat. It became ""the bass buggy"". It had a gold bass hood ornament, stickers on the doors and ""kiss my bass"" on the lift gate. I wish I had pictures, good times."
1056377,dave524,2020-02-14 00:57:00,4508,"Had it's cousin, an '88 with the same 2.8 V6, wasn't quick but looked cool with the T Top. Bought it for $3500 in '99 from the old gent neighbour behind me, sold it in 2007 to a friend of my stepdaughters, I must of got a good one, no complaints here. "
1056383,DanD,2020-02-14 11:38:00,2223,What fond memories I have of the 3rd generation Camaro. LOL They were a great vehicle; on the standpoint of a mechanic/garage owner; always something going wrong with them. There is one that stands out in my mind. It came in with a brake issue; set it up on the hoist and started lifting it. It was about a foot off the ground and all I heard was a very loud pop and glass flying everywhere. The thing flexed so bad that it blew the rear hatch glass out of it. I was not a happy camper; a hundred dollar repair job; cost me about 8 hundred for a new rear window. Dan.
1056384,Garnet,2020-02-14 12:32:00,2056,I would trade my truck for new GMC Safari in a minute.

Both were great vehicles, both for comfort and reliability and neither ever needed more than basic maintenance. Really happy with them."
1056386,dave524,2020-02-14 12:49:00,4508,"Had a '97 , the only mini van that was actually a truck. That 4.3 pulled like a small V8, I really don't see why they discontinued them , make more sense than these $50,000 plus Yuppie pickups that are all cabin space and no box. "
1056389,lew,2020-02-14 13:28:00,12766,I bought a new boat in '09 and the tongue weight was just a bit too much and the engine didn't really have the power to pull that heavy boat for long distances so I decided to get rid of it.  I've been driving those yuppie trucks ever since  LOL
