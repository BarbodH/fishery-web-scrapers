The motor is a 2016  Mercury 90hp 4 stroke.  I need to remove the lower unit to get the fin repaired. Over the years I have done one on an older motor, but this one scares me a bit since it's almost new outboard. I have read on line that the shifter has to be in forward gear position  before removing the lower unit. Some say Neutral l is the the better way . Any help on this is greatly appreciated. Thanks"

1056164,FishOn,2020-02-07 23:42:00,136,"Thanks for the quick replies. Being in gear, would be easier to re-instal it. Thats what. I have been told."
1056165,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-07 23:47:00,10439,Much easier. If it's not in gear you can't turn the prop to engage the drive shaft to the engine. Prop turns but shaft does not. Very hard to line up the splines with it out of gear. I know because I forgot once with my old 90 2 stroke. Took forever to get it back in.
