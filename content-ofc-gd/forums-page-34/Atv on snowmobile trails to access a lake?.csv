1056506,Tjames09,2020-02-19 01:35:00,664,For some reason I thought I had heard or read this was allowed. Can an atv go on snowmobile trail strictly to access a lake for fishing?
1056507,BillM,2020-02-19 02:13:00,17367,"Yes, outlined by the OFAH.   There's a PDF out there that outlines everything"
1056528,Tjames09,2020-02-20 01:10:00,664,Thanks Bill. I will look for that.
1056530,gaspumper,2020-02-20 01:55:00,393,"While engaged in angling activities during open season, as defined in the Ontario Fishery Regulations made under the Fisheries Act (Canada), pursuant to a valid fishing or fishing/hunting outdoors card and a valid sport fishing validation tag, both issued under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997, and while travelling on Crown or other public land directly to or from the area open for angling, within the meaning of the Fisheries Act (Canada), if the trail is the only access route from the closest road to the area open for angling or is the only safe access route to the area open for angling."
1056531,Fisherman,2020-02-20 01:58:00,7201,"That is only for snowmobiles. https://www.ofah.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Snowmobile-exemptions-for-hunters-anglers-and-trappers.pdf Furthermore don't attempt to say ride from Barrie to Orillia on the trail without a permit,  it is intended to allow access via the closest drop off point/parking lot for your vehicle/trailer."

1056535,Tjames09,2020-02-20 12:25:00,664,Ya I found the article. And the law as well. It’s not exactly clear. It lists the exemption but doesn’t say if you can use an atv. https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/010185
1056538,Fisherman,2020-02-20 14:08:00,7201,"There's a number of articles outlining NO use of ATV/SxS on snowmobile trails, with the exemption of some private trails such as the ones up in Haliburton that have dual use where you buy an extra permit for riding.  It's unfortunate to say the least, maybe one of these years we will get more winter trails for ATV's."
1056540,Chris J,2020-02-20 14:44:00,44,"Nothing makes a guy buying a trail permit to help maintain trails and keep a system in place happier then seeing a side by side or ATV rutting up a freshly groomed trail to access a lake miles away.  Saw a side by side stuck in the middles of the E trail last week while ""fishing"".  Some use it as an excuse but others just don't give a shi*.  I personally don't care if they use trails to access fishing spots but its the AZZhats that ruin it for them all, not just ATV's etc but some snowmobilers are even worse going off trail and destroying things."

1056560,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-20 21:26:00,8243,The law isn't exactly clear? Say it ain't so. That's why we have more Judges and lawyers than Doctors in this province.
1056757,Dara,2020-02-26 13:26:00,3052,Please keep the ATV's off the snowmobile trails. It isn't safe.  If you want more winter atv trails maybe go build them like all the snowmobile clubs did to ride snowmobiles
1056771,Terry,2020-02-26 16:39:00,14456,They are looking to access lakes and in most cases where snowmobile clubs have made the access part of their trail systems and people who still want to access the lake not run the trail system just to run the trails
