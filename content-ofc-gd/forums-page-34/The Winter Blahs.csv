1056182,lew,2020-02-08 18:57:00,12766,"Can't imagine anybody is suffering much from the Winter Blah's today with this gorgeous weather. I went for a 2 hour hike this morning, came home and had lunch then went back out and spent 2 more hours moving snow around. Still didn't want to come in but I ran outta snow to shovel  LOL"
1056183,Fisherman,2020-02-08 19:06:00,7201,Nothing like a bluebird day to pick up the spirits.
1055858,gordy28,2020-01-30 23:01:00,638,"As I write this I realize compared to previous year winter of 2019/2020 has not been a beast But personally winter is my least favorite season.  Most of the stuff I love to do like kayaking, hiking, camping, fishing and golfing are all a Sping to Fall deal (ice fishing excluded) Over the years I have developed some of my own ways to cope but also interested in hearing others We recently hit the RV show which was a fun way to spend an afternoon thinking of summer during the winter.  In a good year we try to head down south somewhere to get back to spending time outside in the sun and so forth. Anyway latest post is up on this very topic https://www.northernjacks.com/post/a-summer-lovers-guide-for-beating-the-winter-blahs Cheers Andrew "
1055859,Fisherman,2020-01-30 23:06:00,7201,"It's the lack of sunshine that throws a wrench at me, I hate those grumpy grey days."
1055862,gordy28,2020-01-30 23:48:00,638,For sure and I hate leaving for work in the dark and then driving home from work in the dark I am not sure how people who live in places where its almost all dark do it!
1055863,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-31 01:34:00,10439,We drink a lot!!!!!! 😝
1055865,AKRISONER,2020-01-31 02:07:00,5558,"The weather this year has really got me down. This in between state of no good ice, but also no open water is messing with me. If it’s gonna be winter at least let me go snowboarding and snowmobiling and ice fishing etc. there is nothing enjoyable about these 0 degree rain storms."
1055871,gordy28,2020-01-31 14:15:00,638,So true that this winter hasn't been full anything.  Went tobogganing last week after that big snow and was like - this is fun but its the first time the snow has actually stayed long enough to do it this winter.  And then it was pretty much gone in 3 or 4 days 
1055880,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-31 19:07:00,8243,"I would rather have -10C days with bluebird skies than +C dreary overcast days. The only thing that keeps me sane is planning trips south. We were in The D.R. for 10 days after New Years and are heading back at the end of Feb for 2 weeks, thank God. I wish my wife would retire soon and say good bye to  these winters. In Finland when they only get a bit of daylight, a few hours, they have tanning beds at the Hospitals and work places to spend some time in. They get through the winter by drinking copious amounts of semi frozen Vodka and hot tar (black tar from the ground not the trees) mixed into it. Certainly an acquired taste."
1055884,pics,2020-01-31 21:14:00,1268,So far this year I haven't even looked at my ice gear. It isn't looking too good for the rest of the season either.  We don't even have frost really because I was able to put up a temporary fence to keep the dogs out of the worst of the mud.. the rebar went right into the ground without any hammering..
1055885,SirCranksalot,2020-01-31 22:30:00,3291,Days are getting longer. Nights are getting shorter. Some of us think there is a connection(Red Green)
1055886,misfish,2020-02-01 00:07:00,29133,"I remember when I lived in Brampton and Etobicoke. During the winter months I was able to fish the 4 sisters for browns. All winter long. Open water. Simcoe was a thought at times and did some perch fishing and the odd laker fish then through the ice. Had the best of both. Now up here it,s, sketchy ice to fish on,  rivers that are either blown,froze over or too cold to fish.  I agree. Be winter . Make up my mind."
1055890,GBW,2020-02-01 02:05:00,8460,This winter I have only gotten out ONE time so far on Sturgeon and it sucked.  This weekend my Mrs and my boy are going to visit my parents (at a lake) and I don't plan to bring my gear for that visit tomorrow due to ice safety and how far we would have to walk. So far this winter I have either won or purchased some new fishing toys but yet to use them *sigh* and I am thinking of already selling them UN-USED!  It sucks!    
1055895,irishfield,2020-02-01 05:41:00,26272,Enjoy what you can or you'll go off the deep end. !! You are a Canadian no... lol   
1055898,lew,2020-02-01 11:27:00,12766,I had one at the backdoor yesterday too Wayne but the picture didn't come out well 
1055902,SirCranksalot,2020-02-01 14:04:00,3291,Yup----embrace it!!!
1055905,irishfield,2020-02-01 16:21:00,26272,This one stole the cup out of Leah's hand Lew... guess it knew what Baileys was! LOL  
1055906,lew,2020-02-01 16:40:00,12766,Even the critters of the forest enjoy the finer things in life  LOL
1055909,Sinker,2020-02-01 19:15:00,8692,"I haven't missed a week of fishing yet. You gotta get off your butt, and go. Sitting here complaining doesn't do anything to help. Put some gas in the truck, pack 'er up with your gear, and go for a tour. You won't know unless you go. I've seen so much false reporting online this year, its rediculous. One person says theres no ice, i drive, and find plenty. You won't know if you don't go. I can't really complain, i've been out lots so far, and have 2 major 5 day trips coming up that are going to be amazing!!"
1055911,captpierre,2020-02-01 19:52:00,2521,Did some tubing last week at Snow Valley with the wife. Had a blast!  Super fast and fun. No skill required. Very safe. Then stopped off at Cabela’s on the way home  A good day  
1055932,pics,2020-02-02 01:57:00,1268,Depends where you live.. I am minimum 2 hours from any ice and that's if I can get through Toronto without slowing down..
1055940,Sinker,2020-02-02 15:39:00,8692,You should move then .....lol....that's not acceptable! S.
1056038,gordy28,2020-02-04 16:28:00,638,"Some pretty interesting suggestions and love the nature pictures At this stage in my life its pretty tough to just head out due to my family responsibilities on most weekends But I do love a good adventure and it doesnt need to be fishing Hit the Terra Gardens Winter Market in Milton (believe they have one in Hamilton as well) last weekend and had a good time.  Lots of local foods, crafts and such Foundry Ice Cream which is in Hamilton was amazing http://foundryicecream.com/ https://www.terragreenhouses.com/winter-market-2020-hub "
1056126,Lape0019,2020-02-06 20:36:00,647,I too ave felt the affects before but this year is a bit different. The entire family has taken up skiing which is something I used to do when I was younger and now I am wondering why ever stopped.  
1056139,Moosebunk,2020-02-07 04:07:00,3970,"Medically... Worked for years with this Doctor nut who was convinced Vitamin D supplements were the be-all-and-end-all to soooo many things.  I'd get tired of consulting with him on patients cause he'd want to prescribe it for just too many things. Even 5 years ago I'd think phewy about it!  Until I began working in Nunavut and found that some other co-workers were taking it to help them through the 24 hours of darkness. Every November/December for years, to some degree some things would start to bother... and sometimes some things could last the winter.  I'd self diagnose maybe a mild S.A.D. or just think I was down for this reason or that. But, in Nunavut 4 years ago I began taking Vitamin D daily through the dark months, 2000-3000 units each morning, and I honestly do believe it helps.  First and foremost with mood, second to that cognition and energy too. In the summer nobody soaks in D from the sun better than pale faced gingers.  That's good for feeling vital, (bad down the road for cancers) but honestly the sun and D do much to make people feel good.  The more dark the skin, the more clothed we are (like my patients in the Arctic) the more masked we are from soaking in adequate D. Do your own research on it and find out for yourself how it can help.  Again, in Nunavut during the 24 hours of dark, the insane cold that keeps me indoors for a month, dealing with sick patients one-after-another daily, and the sleep deprivation that can come with a work/call schedule of 24 hours a day 7 days a week, any legal help I can get from a harmless pill is welcome.  I find some benefits to Vitamin D for the winter blues."
1056146,captpierre,2020-02-07 13:41:00,2521,Sounds compelling. But as you know there are so many variables. And then there’s the placebo effect. It can be crazy.  I know too much Vit D can cause problems. Lots of MS in higher latitudes. Canada has Highest rate in the world. Some researchers think there’s a link to lack of Vit D.  Interesting topic.
1056181,gordy28,2020-02-08 18:00:00,638,Interesting take and thanks for sharing I am going to do some reading and check it out. Cheers Andrew
