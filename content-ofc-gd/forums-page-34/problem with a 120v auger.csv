1056060,Rodbender,2020-02-04 23:38:00,1027,120V plug it in the wall ðŸ¤­ 
1056061,Terry,2020-02-04 23:40:00,14456,If I could convert to dc I would
1056062,misfish,2020-02-04 23:43:00,29133,"Take it to Cabelas, open the charger box,plug it in,put battery on it."
1056063,misfish,2020-02-04 23:48:00,29133,"LOL  Just bring it to me at work. I,ll have it checked out for you.Â  Probl;y faster then looking for some one that has the same auger."
1056064,Terry,2020-02-04 23:51:00,14456,"How can you tell ,the battery has 2 bars and testing it says it lower voltage then full charged and the charger charges for 4 seconds the shuts off saying battery is charged"
1056065,misfish,2020-02-05 00:02:00,29133,Stick your tong on the terminals. Just like those 9 volts we did as a kid. LOL
1056066,Terry,2020-02-05 00:04:00,14456,Old school i used a volt meter
1056067,Rodbender,2020-02-05 00:14:00,1027,Sorry dude I didn't know they had 120v battery
1056068,irishfield,2020-02-05 00:18:00,26272,Sounds like my flip phone !!Â  Get it working... no real ice up Nord!
1056107,DanD,2020-02-06 12:07:00,2223,"Try connecting a couple of jumper wires between the charger's electrical tabs and then to the battery's tabs. Then connect the voltmeter across the battery's tabs and take a voltage reading. Now plug the charger in and before the charger kicks off take another battery voltage reading. The battery may be on its way out and can only takeÂ in a surface charge? If so that surface charge will spike quickly, causing the charger to think it has a fully charged battery and turns itself off? Dan. "

1056187,Terry,2020-02-08 19:22:00,14456,So you know if cabelas sells just the charger Â  I can see it listed anywhere 
1056189,misfish,2020-02-08 19:58:00,29133,"No, I asked about that. Need to buy on lineÂ  . We had a great talk aboutÂ  part supplies for many things. Seems the companies do not want to deal with parts sold by stores.Â  Total BÂ  S if you ask me."
