I'm going to buy a new cover this year, but I have never found a good way to keep the cover elevated on the boat when not in use. I've tried several garbage cans, but I still get pooling in any moderate rain. Any thoughts?"

Home Depot or any building supplier  has  galvanized reinforcement bars/mesh  that can be bent into an arch, eight feet long and about eight inches wide; looks like a ladder sorry the actual name escapes me. They can be bent to shape and  are somewhat spring loaded when bent.    	just a thought. I try to adapt and invent.  "

1056196,discophish,2020-02-08 21:49:00,392,"Very common issue that becomes quite the annoyance after a while.  I built a modular frame using some leftover PVC pipe from a septic job to fit over the mooring cover.  There is a post in the mid section to support the length of the spine.  For the winter setup, ratchet straps are fastened to various points on the frame and pulled into the mooring cleats to prevent shifting or separation.  Just drape the cover over the frame/motor, tighten up, and there you go!  Everything comes apart for easy storage.  Perhaps something similar to this design will help with your options."
