976877,NAW,2016-07-18 02:05:00,4022,"As some of you may have read, I planned a one night yak fishing/camping trip for this weekend.  I posted about it early last week to see if anyone wanted to join me.  But for obvious reason, I didn't end up finding anyone to tag along.  But that's OK with me, I love hitting the bush solo.  My work asked me to work Saturday, so I did a short shift from 8 to 2.  Then headed up ""north"".   Over all, is was a great little trip.  The fishing was slow.  But I managed a few bass and pike.  No eyes, which was disappointing, but I know they are in there!!  The boat launch.   The paddle in to my site.    Portage #1          Portage #2               My site       The yak         On my first cast I tied in to a decently sized pike.  We tussled for a bit, and when I was about to try to land him (first pike ever in the kayak), something rather unexpected happened.  The dam pike jumped right in to my kayak!!!  No kidding.  This 5 to 6 lb pike (not big by any means) jumped in to the kayak right between my feet!!  He only sat there for about 10 seconds, then thrashed himself back in to the water.  I thought the fight was back on and started heaving on my rod...  But after a few seconds, I realized that my x-rap was hooked on my fishing pack, and the pike had swam away!!!   Jesus, I laughed about that for a few minutes...     This particular river gets a lot of traffic.  Its kind of a funny sorry, but I was fishing in the evening Saturday night, and a ran in to a camp with 27 kids in the middle of a 60km canoe trip through their summer camp.  These kids where pretty cool, and we chatted for a bit.  Some of the boys where across the bay fishing from a rock, and we heard them light up in cheers of excitement, so I paddled over to see what they caught! Turns out they had a school of catfish swim by.  They landed 2, and smashed their heads with rocks.  But they had no clue how to clean them.  And they where going to toss one back as I was pulling up.  These boys knew nothing about fishing, or cleaning fish.  So they gave me one of the cat fish, and I gave them a good lesson on how to clean a fish, and sent them back to camp with a pile of cat fish fillets.  They where really keen to learn how to clean fish, and where very appreciative of the lesson!    They let me snap a quick pic of them in their new favorite fishing spot!        The view from my tent saturday night   Sunday morning I woke up with the son, and did some top water fishing.  Caught a few bass and pike.  Snapped a few pics ..           Top water pike and bass are fun!   Old cribs.  I have no idea what they where used for back in the day?         First bit of civilzation on my trip.   With the weather so nice, I decided to push a little further out in to G-Bay than I have before in the past.  You know, as you push further west, you run in to more and more civilization.  And you have to start sharing the water with some seriously big boats!!  With seriously big wake!!  You have to pay attention out there, that's for sure.   I love this guys boat.                       Fried up the cat fish for lunch sunday  Man it was good!   a pile of vultures on my way home.    Anyways.  I've rambled on long enough.  Hope you enjoyed my little report and pics!  My lens was dirty and I didn't realize it until a Saturday evenning, so some of the photos are fuzzy.. Wups.  Until next time."

976964,AKRISONER,2016-07-18 21:04:00,5558,what a sunday morning it was...sounds very very peaceful
976978,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-18 23:08:00,8243,You too Terry. It sucks this getting old bull poo. Guess what? Apparently it does not get any better. Now I know what that rye smile on the older guys when we would have a chin up contest in the middle of nightshift at the plant. Wait until you get my age. The Feds don't pay you every month for nuthin'. It's to alleviate the pain a bit.

976985,bigugli,2016-07-18 23:50:00,6138,Great little out trip and report. Purty sure I recognize a couple of those spots.  Pity my body just don't work that well any more for inland canoe treks.
976987,woodenboater,2016-07-19 00:40:00,2277,"great pics ! man that looked like a great quick getaway, will need to come along next time. I'll make jerk chicken on the coleman oven as well.  I love solitude but always cool to one across paddlers from a  tripping camp. also a few of those rapids I'd love to run in my play boat"
976997,NAW,2016-07-19 02:03:00,4022,Thanks for reading guys!  I mapped my paddle on map my run this morning.  And it turns out I did 40km of paddling!!  Man. No wonder my arms are killing me!!!
977035,Cast-Away,2016-07-19 16:26:00,790,Great report Nick. It looks like you were in Port Rawson Bay where the cruisers were all anchored. Did you travel down the Moon River?
977039,NAW,2016-07-19 17:09:00,4022,"Thanks!  This was not the Moon River.  I've done the Moon a few times, and I would have caught way more fish if it had been the Moon!!  I love the Moon, but I can't find any free parking spots!  There are so many back bays on the east side of G-Bay that fill up with cruizers.  It's quite the site to see on Sunday morning, then they all pull anchor and head for port.  It can get pretty choppy out there in a yak!!"
977040,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-19 17:18:00,8243,"Some ofmy very best times were when I did it solo, fishing, vacations. It's nice to share great times with loved ones and those you care deeply about but sometimes you just need to get away on your own and clear the noggin'.  Nick, how do you clean the Cats? Maybe you can share, I have seen a few different ways. Many won't eat Catfish and I don't know why. 25 years ago it was going for 10 bucks a pound in Fla. In the southern mid west that is the only fish they serve."
977044,NAW,2016-07-19 17:57:00,4022,"To be honest with you guys, I would rather camp / fish with my girlfriend Sam! She is becoming a hard-core angler, and lover of the outdoors. Its really great to see!  BUT.. Shes a healthcare worker. And anyone who is in or has a partner in the healthcare field knows what I am talking about. She works 2 weeks days, then 2 week nights. Every other weekend So 1 out of every 4 weekends, she is working 12 hour night shifts Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I hate sitting at home alone all weekend, and tip toeing around the house while she sleeps during the day So I have re-kindled my love for solo outings! And they are great for the mind and soul.   As for the catfish. They are one my favourite fish to eat. I do them just like pickerel. Take one big fillet off each side. Skin comes off the same as a pickerel (Maybe easier). And I cook them the exact same way as pickerel in oil, breaded with egg/milk, the dusted in fishcrisp."
977080,wormdunker,2016-07-19 23:23:00,1711,Nice report Nick.  Your photos are awesome!  I love those Stanley boats!
977207,pics,2016-07-21 02:35:00,1268,That's a cool trip.. some of those back bays where the big boats anchor have some huge gar in them...I work the same shifts as your girlfriend and it sucks sometimes.. the family has to alter their whole weekend when I'm on the 3 nights...
977273,Reel Man,2016-07-22 08:24:00,80,"Looks like a great little trip!  Scenery is beautiful and some nice catches.  Wish more fish were so cooperative, just jump on in!  Awesome that you took the time to pass on a little knowledge to the younger generation as well.  Kudos"
