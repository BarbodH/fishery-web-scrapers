255146,jjcanoe,2008-10-03 20:48:00,744,"I'm planning a fishing trip to Iceland in 2011 to do some trout, salmon and some sea fishing as well.  Just wondering if anyone has ever been there or fished any areas of the country. I've found a few websites but they all seem to be based in Europe and are incredibly expensive package deals. Any help would be greatly appreciated!  jjcanoe"

That pic is of an Atlantic Wolf fish, basically a goby on Steriods, nasty critters, hope I get one of them!  jjcanoe"

976781,Lukedout,2016-07-16 22:13:00,3,Going fishing in Iceland in a few weeks. Any body else have more information on fishing there? I plan on bringing a fly rod as well as a spinning rod.
976785,glen,2016-07-16 23:09:00,2641,Before you go check to make sure jjcanoe made it back.
977087,jjcanoe,2016-07-20 00:18:00,744,"Yes I did make it back lol, from what I experienced, you need to hire a local guide, and the licensing system is similar to the Gaspe in Quebec, you buy a license for a particular stretch of river for a particular day, new day, new license needed! The only good part of this system is that you and your guide will be the ONLY people on that section of river. The license and guide are also incredibly expensive. The cost is dependant on the river or stretch of river you choose, it can be as much as $3000 a day for elite rivers. Only fly fishing is allowed in rivers. Here is a good site that explains a lot http://www.frommers.com/destinations/iceland/254362 You can purchase a pass for certain interior lakes, 30 or so scattered around the country, that allows you to fish for trout and char. That's what I did and got a smallish sized Arctic Charr on a super windy day that we were unable to go out to sea. Also take note of the requirements for any rods reels line and tackle you bring into the country, it will be confiscated at the airport if not properly treated and certified. Mine was checked at the airport but was all brand new. (a great excuse to buy some new gear!) If you choose to go this route, a small reel, light rod, a new spool of line, a new (small) box, and a few spinners and spoons, and a few swivels are just about all you need. Just make sure ALL of it is in the original packaging or has tags on it. The bubble pack of Panther Martin's and a few little cleos was all I brought"

977825,JoshS,2016-07-27 16:52:00,729,"Crazy I just got back from Iceland yesterday. Didn't fish unfortunately this trip. I did talk to some river fisherman however. Met a few guys fishing atlantics, apparently the season just opened (this was in the south east). They said it gets better late aug and sept, similar to here. Also saw people fishing browns all over the country. Most fisherman I talked to were fishing river run browns and were bottom fishing worms. Man did their rigs look ugly! A few guys were fly fishing. Everyone I talked to fishing browns were doing quite well in terms of success it seems.  The rivers there and country in general are absolutely beautiful. I've never seen rivers so pristine.  The regulations and requirements are strict from what I was told."
