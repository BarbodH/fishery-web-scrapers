Anyhow, the day ends early today. Thank friggen gawd  A new rod/reel & line are awaiting in the vehicle.  Nothing fancy. A 6'6"" berkley lightening(love that long handle), a daiwa reveros??? And 8lb nanofil.  I pick up 2 of my boys, the only ones game for a shore fish, probably because its like 37 degrees and hot as...  Kids have a black spinner bait on and quickly land a few small bass! And a tiny pike  3 cast in a row and the lost good size bass as they jumped? meh, still fun to see the action?  My new rod is flawless? yeah right! Reel is awesome but a lil heavy, oh well.  So next up I catch a few small bass too and everything feels great!  Then I put on a berkley chigger craw(my all time favorite smallie plastic.  First cast...  BAMMM!!!  Whoa! What the heck is this?  30ft out I see the shimmer of silver and immediately call for the kids frantically for pliers and my camera...  I was right! After a few nice runs and an epic 2ft jump, I land my first respectable  MUSKY!!!!!!!  The kids are freaking, im freaking, my finger hurts like the dickens but adrenaline says ""no worries today my friend""  Thank you adrenaline???  No tape to measure but who cares???  Its not record breaking nor hardly impressive to what gets posted here...  BUT TO ME, THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL FISH!!!!  Rainy river rarely turns up a musky so that also adds to it  Anyhow...enjoy(my heart is still a lil heavy on the thump!)                          Not a day Ill soon forget?"
977767,ckewley,2016-07-27 00:20:00,699,"Congrats on your first man, beautiful muskie!"
977769,leaf4,2016-07-27 00:32:00,2466,Nice colour on it! Congrats
977774,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-27 01:00:00,8243,"As Mathew McConnaughey says ""ALL right alright alright"". If from your indez finger to ring finger is 4"" that would be over 30 for sure."

977784,smitty55,2016-07-27 02:28:00,928,"Way to go Rick. Congrats on your first.  Remember this. ""But not musky. I have a musky curse""   I guess you can put that one to bed now. You're cured.  Nice fish, must have been a riot for you.  Cheers"
977786,manitoubass2,2016-07-27 02:32:00,11391,Yeah man! Good point! I posted that yesterday hahahaha  Thanks dood!!! It certainly was a riot!
977793,wormdunker,2016-07-27 08:03:00,1711,"Way to go Rick!  Congrats on your first Musky!  I love your photos, especially the youngsters hooking into a few bass.  Man, I miss your area!  I wish to get a call to get back to work up there."
977823,manitoubass2,2016-07-27 16:39:00,11391,Yeah man come back up!!! Lol  Its always awesome watching the kids hit fish!
977848,DaveRoach,2016-07-27 21:18:00,202,"Congrats, great looking muskie."
977851,AKRISONER,2016-07-27 21:33:00,5558,"yo im thinking of a master plan im blinging with the ski in hand i got a mafk right to shine i paid my dues i earned this fish i abuse   hey man, landing a musky that size on 8lb nano is a feat regardless of size.  i always dreamed of the day that i accidentally ran into a GB musky. I even spend a lot of time casting big lures for pike and unfortunately have never had the pleasure of catching one of these toothy buggers  well done and congrats"
977855,Rizzo,2016-07-27 23:01:00,4754,wow that is a good spot never know what you will get! Congrats on the ski beauty looking fish
977864,manitoubass2,2016-07-28 01:47:00,11391,"Thanks guys!!!  Depending on water levels, this spot holds pike, bass, walleye, crappie, bluegill and suckers.  I catch one musky a year there(so yeah its not my first) but they are all 20"" or so  Its my favorite spot to fish by far  7 years of fishing that spot 100+ times per year, it just holds sooooo many memories?  And now a new one?"
