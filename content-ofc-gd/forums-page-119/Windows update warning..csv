Updates that are important to them, not you as a user, are now being labelled as important so most folks will unknowingly install them. This morning I start up my pc and notice new updates available. So I take a look at the notice and see kb3135583. Hey wait a minute, that looks familiar to me. Didn't I remove that months ago because of problems it was causing, plus it is a win10 patch that caused major controversy among the tech field. So I look it up and yep, this is the same patch that MS has reissued about 4 times now as they try and force win10 on users. So I look at the other ""important update"" kb3173040. Sure enough, it's only purpose is to advertise Win10 and remind people that time is running out for the free ""upgrade"". So my strong advice is for any win7 or 8 users. Do Not Install these updates. Uncheck them to stop the install or if it's too late, go into your update history and remove them. Trust me, they are not good for you.  Cheers"

Think you are safe Cliff, the free upgrade did not extend to Vista users, only Windows 7 and 8. Seriously though, we have 2 new PC's a tablet and laptop running 10 with no problems and an old 7 laptop, plus another laptop and a desktop that we did the free upgrade on with no problems."
977165,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-20 20:47:00,8243,"I am lazy and wouldn't know a bad update if I saw it so I have them update automatically. I know it's bad but like I said I wouldn't know what and what not to update so I TRUST them, bad Johnny.  I bought a first Gen touch screen tablet when 8 was out a week. I didn't need a PC for 10 years. No problem with Windows 9 and 10 gives me problems, silly irritating problems with widows opening that I can't get rid of without selecting them. I grew up with Windows 95' and before that Word Perfect 5.1 for DOS and Pong.  I wish I still had XP, the best Micro Soft ever had. My Dr's office still uses XP Professional."

It's not so much the OS itself, although there certainly are driver issues with hardware not working. Just the fact that MS is giving this away for free, which they have never done before, raises huge flags for me, as there has to be ulterior motives behind their push. Why else would they force these upgrades on users so hard, even without authorization? As it turns out, Win10 is chock full of monitoring and reporting software that in effect tells Microsoft everything you do on your computer. Basically you are losing any presumption of privacy and they can use this info for any purpose they desire, which you can be sure is not for your benefit. Also from what I hear, while it may be free for a start, don't be surprised if Microsoft starts charging a yearly fee for using their software, so they'll get their money anyway.  For those who don't want to ""upgrade"" I suggest using a utility called Never10 or another one called the GWX Control Panel to block MS from pulling a fast one on your system.  Cheers"

Thanx Your easiest fix is to download never10 from https://www.grc.com/never10.htmand run it. It will make the necessary registry changes and block it from installing. Not your case but some pc's could have over 6Gb of data hiding on their system just waiting for the install and never10 would remove that too. MS included all that data as updates, the sneaky buggers. Also check your windows updates and remove those two I mentioned above so you don't get the nag.  Cheers"

That's great news Carp. Goes to show how corrupt Microsoft can be hiding all those files under the guise of Windows updates, the buggers. Plus they say you can revert back within thirty days which in many cases is Bull as users lose much of their data regardless.  Cheers"
