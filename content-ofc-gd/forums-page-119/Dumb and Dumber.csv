Look up George Soros. He's a major contributor to both obamas campaign and clintons campaign  Here is example of another smear parroted by the Fox ""News"" crew and gobbled up by it's wantonly clueless audience. George Soros is a Jew and survived the Holocaust. I guess FishnNAutographs believes Soros tried to collaborate in his own demise?"
977394,glen,2016-07-23 13:19:00,2641,Why does fox smear people. Why is it so hard to see any good people have done.
977396,scuro2,2016-07-23 13:32:00,904,"Why does fox smear people. Why is it so hard to see any good people have done.  Isn't it completely obvious to you Glen? They constantly make crap up about people and think that is okay!...as a society we see this as a big no-no and have even created a word and laws for this behaviour and it is called, slander.  Now when presented with the facts that the Fox Network consistently slanders people you can have one of two reactions, you can become an apologist and believe that lying about people is okay because they have done so much good, or you can rethink why in your right mind you would ever tune into a station that has no morals and sense of self respect."
977399,glen,2016-07-23 13:42:00,2641,Does fox get charged a lot.  One thing about Trump is when his kids got up to speak they did very well.  Does this mean trump is a good person/parent.  The story his daughter told about her calling him when she was young and him always taking the calls. His kids seem to love him.  Some people have had a chance to do good and they just lined there pockets.
977400,scuro2,2016-07-23 13:51:00,904,I was about to agree with you until that last line of your post. Trump has had four bankruptcies and been involved with 3500 lawsuits. If you have enough money and power you can use the law to line your pockets also. I'm sure the bankruptcies didn't hurt other billionaires but rather contractors who got stiffed by Trump who didn't pay his bills. He used the law to shield his millions.

I can't imagine what a great America looks like when this buffoon gets in. His mugging for the camera last night every time someone clapped for him was uncomfortable. Sticking out his chin like Mussolini. His picture should be in Wikipedia as an example of Megalomaniac.

He would only have approved media people to start with so anyone who asks the tough questions wouldn't even be there.. not even the Mexican president would be allowed..
