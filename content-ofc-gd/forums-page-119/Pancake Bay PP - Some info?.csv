975693,Freshtrax,2016-07-06 04:39:00,2215,Keep driving to Agawa bay It puts you closer to more things in the park.   Sand river is a nice hike.  I. Gargantua is a cool place to check out  the road is pretty rough I wouldn't want to do it in a car.  any of the lakes in the park along the highway are stocked with Brookies a small spinner tipped with a worm will get you some.
975695,huzzsaba,2016-07-06 10:00:00,884,Very nice park and friendly staff from my brief stop there for a washroom break lol.  I have heard good things about Agawa bay but never been there. Best person to give you info on the area is Tyler Dunn.  great guy with tons of knowledge of the area.  http://www.tylerdunnguiding.ca/
