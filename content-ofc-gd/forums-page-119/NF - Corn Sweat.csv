977264,John Bacon,2016-07-22 02:01:00,3277,I wonder if extra corn for ethanol is contributing to this effect.   https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ontario-has-endured-polar-vortex-thundersnow-and-195405570.html
977279,Andy,2016-07-22 11:59:00,330,"I can't say that I think there is much more or less corn in Southern Ontario than other years. In certain areas there actually seems to be more winter wheat than usual. I suspect that it's happening because of a particular set of circumstances like a recent rain followed by a hot, dry and stable period of high pressure. But I may be wrong..."
977283,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-22 13:35:00,8243,"I see less corn planted out here this year. And yes, more winter wheat. Some beans are just dismal with this lack of rain."
977285,KLINKER,2016-07-22 13:59:00,256,Ban on treated seed = less corn
977319,Big Cliff,2016-07-22 19:38:00,6899,"Most of the corn fields that I see are way behind where they should be for this time of year. By now I am usually harvesting sucker ears to pickle, this year is at least two weeks behind normal in our area."
977401,nofish4me,2016-07-23 14:04:00,404,"Corn is not looking good in some areas. Less corn planted in a certain area, maybe simply due to crop rotation. Can't plant same crop year after year, depletes the soil of nutrients required."
977558,pics,2016-07-25 00:58:00,1268,"there may be more wheat due to the depressed price of corn and beans.. as for crop rotation we haven't seen that around here.. the big players around my place just rent the land so taking care of it isn't high on their priority list.. just put more pellet fertilizer down, spray the round up and go...This year I have noticed that with the drought the fields that aren't rotated are doing poorly..20mm for the last month ... I'm not sure how much a field can sweat when the ground is dried up..."
