I have never had a sunburn or even a noticable tan though my clothes.  Unless the rays that cause tans and burns are different than the rays that cause skin cancer, I think that any clothing seems to offer pretty good protection.  I am not convinced that special UV blocking clothes are required.  Perhaps some people who have extra sensitive skin (perhaps from radiation therapy) may require the extra protection of special clothing; but normal clothing seems to be enough for most people."

I took a tanning course and if you read between the lines taught you about tanning and how to crap people into thin king its better for you.The best shirts IMO are the Eddy Bauer long sleeve. I have been lucky enough to find them on sale and super inexpensive. Eddy Bauer is my favorite shirt by far and I use an army style wide brimmed hat, when I remember. Also use the shirts for the collar protection but sometime cheat and go short sleeves with minimum 50 sun screen. Since they have great ones that are spray on, its so easy to apply, we really have no excuses. Another thing thats great for protection and are super easy to use are the face sticks. Like a big lip balm that you rub on and away you go...."

In all seriousness; I think if you are prone to the big C you are going to get it regardless and if you aren't then you won't. I know countless people that have spent their lives out in the sun, farmers, bush workers, that never used a drop of sun screen or special clothing, many are as old as or older than I am.

977201,npt1,2016-07-21 01:38:00,220,"​When I was diagnosed by a Dermatologist, he told me I had Actinic Keratosis,  a common form of skin cancer ​to folks who are light haired and have blue eyes, light complexion and are outdoors a lot of the time, working, recreation, etc.. It scared the living sh** out of me, He prescribed a medication cream for me to use on my scalp, face, ears, nose , all infected skin areas. ​ I  am now free of any signs  of skin cancer and I have modified my life style to keep it that way.​  ​I stay out of the sun as much as possible, use sun screen, bought a wide brimmed Tilley hat, so cool looking, never go outside without ​my hat on, even on a cloudy day, those rays can reek havoc on your scalp, ​Melanoma is a life changing experience, if you are young and read this, don't think that you are invincible, YOUR NOT, time will catch up ​ with you !!!"
976696,Pikeslayer,2016-07-16 00:29:00,1443,"So earlier this year, I had a brush with skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma, not the worst, but still unnerving. Got it carved out & follow ups were all good. However, the specialist did say that I was at high risk due to my recreational lifestyle. Lots of golf, fishing & time on the water. Like lots of us here. Made a promise to my wife that I would follow through with preventative measures and I have (for the most part) kept my word. Tons of sunscreen (not the best long term option), wide brimmed head covering, protective clothing and I no longer spend 6+ hours on the water or in the sun on a given day. My SIL bought me a variety of UPF rated shirts for Father's Day this year & I can't stand them. Hot, sticky (despite the venting) & ultimately stinky & they always end up unbuttoned & rolled up sleeves;    So the subject came up in a casual discussion the other day with my good Pakistani friend (Big Cliff). Never heard about skin cancer or sunscreen before he arrived in Canada??  So long story short, after considerable research I decided that this option would be a better solution both UPF & comfort;    It is known as a Shalwar Kameez. 100% cotton with a dense but light thread weight, lots of room for air flow and extremely comfortable & cool (especially when commando;) ). I estimate that given the thread density & the darker colour, it's on the higher side for cotton with a UPF rating of 60+. I can up that if I wish by using RIT UV dye, but I've read some questionable data on that stuff. Still need the sunscreen for face, hands & feet as well as my Aussie Akubra, but I believe I'm better protected from the sun than I ever have been.  Now just need to check the club dress code"

I cycle between 5 Simms UPF rated shirts and 3 pairs of SIMMS long UPF pants. Like you I've had my bout with cancer. In my case it wasn't skin cancer, but the chemo drugs left my skin pretty sensitive to UV light. I also can't scratch myself hard or it's permanent.  From top to bottom: Baseball cap Polarized sunglasses UV Buff Simms Guide shirt (UPF 50) Simms zip pants (UPF 50) Wigwam liner socks Columbia water shoes Simms guide sun gloves (UPF 50) UPF 30-60 sunscreen on whatever skin is exposed (UPF depends on whatever is on sale at the store)    With that setup, I can wade in the water and I'm dry within 15mins if it's sunny out."
976705,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-16 01:20:00,8243,"I slather up with that hi SPF goop since I as well have had a few dark spots my Dr. doesn't like on my forehead and arms. No plan to carve them out yet. I wear a long sleeve hi SPF shirt and always wear long cotton pants, mainly for bugs. I wear a bandana when I remember and a wide brim hat when I remember that too. That's fishing only, golfing, shorts and short sleeve and cap. My wife gives me all Hell for that.  I don't like to fish or golf after 12 noon. The best prevention is to stay out of the Sun and that isn't happening anytime soon. When we were kids we would try and fry ourselves, the damage was done then I'm told but not to late to slow everything down.  I hope the worse is over for you my Middle Eastern friend."

These guys have a bunch of stuff and some pretty decent sales too. The long sleeve shirts actually breathe really, really well and it feels like you are shirtless but they have great UV stopping power. Same deal with the face shields.  There are plenty of other manufacturers of this type of clothing as well. Last time I was in Florida I went to the Tampa boat show and got a bunch of shirts off a friend of a friend for a really good price."

976751,JoePa,2016-07-16 14:58:00,179,Boy - I remember when I was growing up - we ran around all summer with our shirts off and got sunburned a lot - to a point where our skin would blister and eventually peal off - we were told that the sun was good for you because you got vit D that way -  I've had some cancer on my one ear - that was taken care of - around my place I wear a wide brim hat but don't use any sun screen - when I'm out fishing I do because the sun reflects off the water - I think growing a beard would help keeping the sun off you face  Somehow I think it is more than just the sun that is involved because sometimes you hear of people getting cancer in spots that rarely get any sun - if ever -  When I work in the sun now I wear an old white long sleeved dress shirt - I think that is better than nothing
976875,huzzsaba,2016-07-18 01:56:00,884,"pikeslayer, I too wear the shalwar kameez from time to time due to my background being from India.  it's definitely good for protection from the sun and good ventilation.  Probably the reason why they wear them in those countries in that kind of heat. Undoubtedly very comfortable and you can do splits with the shalwars on lol. I think the key is to have as much cotton to keep cool and lighter color clothes.  My wife has also started to push me at being more careful out in the sun and I have started using sunscreen this year.  I will also be trying long sleeve shirts which will be a first for me  If you need a couple of more pairs of shalwar kameez, shoot me a pm.  I have a few new ones you can have ."
