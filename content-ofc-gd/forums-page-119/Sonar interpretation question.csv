977262,chris.brock,2016-07-22 00:58:00,4053," I've seen this on many lakes, anytime of the year, ice fishing too.  I was trolling a flat last weekend, back and forth, watching the graph.  As soon as the sun is down, the screen lights up like this. 8:43 is actually 9:43    I'm guessing they're benthic invertebrates rising off bottom? Has anybody else seen this? what kind of bugs are they?"
977263,porkpie,2016-07-22 01:55:00,2521,I often see that with may/shad fly hatches. Couldn't say with any certainty though.  Your mileage may vary.

I wouldn't know what kind of bug they are; that may depend on the season, depth, and waterbody."

977271,Freshtrax,2016-07-22 04:29:00,2215,I've seen similar screens never knew what to make of it.
977276,Joeytier,2016-07-22 09:51:00,3990,Looks like a rabid pack of 4-6 pound walleyes...why couldn't you catch any??
977277,Terry,2016-07-22 10:00:00,14456,looks like the gull lake ghosts rising from the bottom

977398,fishindevil,2016-07-23 13:37:00,6254,Yes I have seen that too Chris on the shield lakes I fish especially over mud flat bottoms it's the bottom comming alive as well as bait mixed in feeding on them you can fine tune it as well but remember if you see bait feeding the big fish are usually not too far away .......drag a tube or dropshot that for sure .....
