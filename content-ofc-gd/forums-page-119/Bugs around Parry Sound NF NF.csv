977810,AKRISONER,2016-07-27 14:37:00,5558,its been dry this year and hot...expect the deer and horse flys to be pretty bad  blackflies will be long gone  and the skitters shouldnt be that bad except at dusk. But even then they shouldnt be that bad this year because of the heat. I would say bring some bug dope and you should be fine.

As the above post states it has been very dry up there this year and that has put the skids on a lot of the bugs. Blackflies are long gone , skeeters only at dusk and deer flies are pretty well gone but are still out in some areas . I have a place just outside of McKellar and there is no deer flies but go a little north of there and they are still buzzing around ."

977908,misfish,2016-07-28 18:52:00,29133,Just got back from the burksfalls area bud. I didnt even get a mosqitou bite. Usually I get eaten alive while setting up the toon. 1 deer fly all morning. He dead now though. Fish food. Dragon flys were fun to watch.
977909,Dan668,2016-07-28 20:34:00,1120,Deer flies are terrible on the french right now. Mosquitoes surprisingly not bad at all. Just that short period after sundown.
