977820,PUMP KNOWS,2016-07-27 16:29:00,937,"Thank you, do you remember how much it was?"
977826,bare foot wader,2016-07-27 16:54:00,1354,"ebay can be very expensive for spools, shop carefully with that  my most recent order was just last week so good timing lol.....stradic FJ 2500 spool, part number 14928, $31.59"
977829,FrankTheRabbit,2016-07-27 17:18:00,479,And shipping items via eBay from the States nets you a stupid Global Shipling Charge of like $20 minimum. Costs more than the shipping. Cash grab for sure.
977833,salmon,2016-07-27 18:32:00,334,Call Shimano in Peterborough. They will transfer you over to the USA offfice. Make sure you order the matching  drag cap. They are not the same.
