977645,AKRISONER,2016-07-25 23:12:00,5558,"Hi Guys,  As many of you know, I dabble here and there when it comes to fishing...and as per my last review thread, I prefer to post these reports on a more annual/semi annual basis.  In the past 9 months much has changed in my life, including a big move, a lot of first fishies, my first fly in and even taking up fly fishing (boy what have i gotten myself in to!)  I would say that as of August last year my passion for fishing basically exploded, unfortunately I am now very far from the place i hold so dear to my heart. However I am doing my best to make due with what ive got..hopefully my next report will have some more firsts and hopefully many on the fly!  So once again without further adieu its AKRISONERS (Ae-Kree-one-ers) year 9 months in review lol  My last report left me getting ready for the fall, after a succesful trip out with Pete to nab my first musky, it all rolled very nicely into the fall pickerel run.  Early signs were saying it was looking like a very good year. The weekend prior dave had popped a 24 inch eye off the end of the dock..he figured he could pull it off again. After a succesful morning run, dave makes a trip down to the dock, i head down as well to get some stuff in the boat. Dave says to me ""scott what are the odds of me catching another eye on the hair down here"" i say, ""dave in the 10 years ive had this place ive caught 2 eyes off of the dock, so most likely very slim"" he says ""you are probably right"" and immediately sets the hook into a fish...im sitting watching as his rod bends in half...I immediately can tell its an eye, and its big  imageupload  25 inches and 8.5 lbs...the photo doesnt even do this fish justice...it was as thick as ive ever seen an eye and absolutely immaculate. Not a nick on the fish. Back she went to swim another day.  the fall continued on and Dave's buddy Connor was talking a lot about how we were missing out having never river fished...with the really sketchy december weather and ice we were having up north, Connor finally convinced us to try out hand at river fishing. Out came the ultra lights, super light tackle, floats. Spent a day hiking around trying things out...to me skunks dont bother me, especially when im trying out a brand new technique...as we were about to call it a day Connor starts moving spastically, i wonder what the heck is going on..and sure enough hes hooked into a bow, and a decent one at that...an intense battle happens, including connor jumping into the river fully clothed in order to try land the damn thing...of course we didnt bring a net  pic upload  the weird fall weather (spring?) continued, lots of rain and lot of warm temperatures...a trip down to st kitts for christmas had me wondering what the heck was this season anyways, heres me walking my dog in a t shirt and shorts on christmas eve +19????? what the heck!  imagen  being down in St kitts had me thinking that it would probably be smart to put my newly learned float techniques to work..a few early morning sneaky fishing trips had the misses not even realizing i had left! Day 1 I got skunked but proceeded to watch a guy across the river land a few fish...this had me wondering what the heck i was doing wrong. As i was walking to the parking lot I got a piece of intel from a local who informed me that the guy I was watching catch all morning was throwing crank baits...interesting...back to the drawing board! I began reading and trolling the internet for intel on catching river fish on cranks...a quick trip to bass pro and i was back on the water the next day.  Unfortunately for me the weather had taken a serious turn, we went from 16 degrees and fine, to 0 and snow and rain with intense winds overnight...Freezing my you know what off standing on the pier in 70kmh winds and driving snow/rain I finally cashed in (and i deserved it)  my first river fish and it was a brown to boot!  images hosting  dave having made the trip all the way down to st kitts from g town at 4am only managed a stinky sucker  images hosting  poor guy, the fish was even insulting him  the weather finally turned, but boy did the ice take some time to settle...Dave one day messages me after completing his ritual of laying out all of his hard water gear, going over everything, testing out his brand new marcum LX, checking leaders, organizing and re-organizing his boxes ""my dad came in my room last night and saw me with all of my ice gear out, he told me to get a girlfriend""  finally the ice arrived a trip to orangeville was called..having fished this lake a few times the prior winter, we knew what we were in for...some dink pikes, a couple of laughs and an enjoyable day fishing.  Dave and I switched it up though...having just bought a gas auger we figured, lets give err a serious go, lets punch 100 holes and see what we can find. So off we went hammering holes and finally settled on one location where dave immediately hooked up  images hosting  Dave wasnt crazy impressed having fished georgian bay with me the previous fall, his pike taste had grown...but to be honest so had these pike!  images hosting  Dave even managed to pop one on one of his own tied hair jigs  this made him pretty happy  images hosting  My cottage under renovation I was unable to visit until the place got closed up...so not much fishing was had...i made a trip to visit some friends out in vancouver and make a trip out to whistler...I like snowboarding as much as i like ice fishing  images hosting  I also asked my long time girlfriend to marry me...and she said yes surprisingly  that same day she ended up also getting a job offer in Vancouver...holy crap things were moving fast! I guess it was time to make the big move...The next few months were frigging hectic! I knew i had a bathroom that needed renovating before the house could be sold...im a bit handy, used to work on cars, have done some tiling and the usual...bit of plumbing you know...so it was time to renovate that bathroom. The fiance left to start work and Van and i stayed in Toronto and got to work  images hosting  images hosting  After 2 weeks of working 9-5...coming home and then working on the bathroom from 5-2/3 sometimes even 4am i needed a fish...even if the cottage wasnt done. I got word that the roof had been put in...so at least we were in a somewhat insulated structure...the weather cooperated and lows of -5 made it easy squatting. It was time to put a hurting on some winter walters  A spot that we found that produced in the fall, really produced for us that day...When we arrived on the lake a big crowd (relative...15-20 people) on an area of the lake...we pulled up but went 50 yards off to our spot...watching everyone else get skunked while we started pounding eyes. I somehow lost the photos of the ones i caught, but dave outfished me anyways  images hosting  images hosting  images hosting  Daves turning into quite the pickerel fisher...dont let him know that though it might get to his head.  Jeez we even managed some georgian bay sauger...now thats one for the books  images hosting  Back home to finish the reno it was and get the house sold  images hosting  made a trip up north for some pans while the house was for sale...spent a lot of time on the water until i finally found a set of sunny schooling in the most tucked back corner i could find...it was fish after fish after fish even if they were small it felt good to once again persevere...i was also rewarded with a beauty sunset  images hosting  boy was i gonna miss this place images hosting   and finally off to the land of hippies and granolas it was.  my dog likes living near somewhere to go for a swim  images hosting  i even climbedmy first BC peak Hollyburn mountain  im  I need to go for a troll on Howe Sound...its pretty dandy  images hosting   I made the decision that if i was going to the west coast, id take it upon myself to take up fly fishing. Doing lots of reading, taking some courses and asking locals I found some details about a spot just outside of town to test my arm at. First though I needed to hike the area to avoid falling off a cliff in the early AM darkness...i have to say the fishing spots out here can be pretty dandy! a lot better than standing on a pier in an industrial area  images hosting  I returned the next morning without the pupper and my homie beezy who came with me on the hike...hooked into a couple small resident trout, lost them as i suck at line management but a beauty day spent on this river makes any time a good time.  The water in this photo is actually 7-8 feet going all the way down to 12...yes its that clear  images hosting  I knew from the get go that I was going to head home for bass opener and a week of vacation that I had already booked with work...so after 1 month on the west coast i headed back to Ontario and boy it felt good to be back out in the boat  first night back in Onterrible wasnt so bad at all  images hosting  we managed a couple of dinks..however i knew the following weekend/week was where I was going to hit pay dirt...i had a week off commencing the day after bass opener running until canada day...time to run and gun my favourite time of the year on GB  My brother was up for the weekend commencing the beginning of my vacation I figured I had to teach him a thing or two about catching big small jaws...we got to the spot, the wind was howling hard at 5 am! not good...as i begin our drift i cast out feel a thump and im thinking thats a big smallie, set the hook and what would you know it i land this nice specimen on a spinner bait! (how american as dave would say)  images hosting  Fishing was pretty slow with the wind we managed a few small ones and then my brother finally hooked into a decent one  a PB for him so he was happy  images hosting  managed some more small fish but nothing crazy. headed home for breakfast...i spent the next couple of days staying close to the cottage...caught a lot of bass just nothing big..then came monday where pops and i planned to take the big boat down to Parry sound harbour to troll up some greasers..spend the night on the boat and then get the morning bite as well  having never had any luck of my own in the past I was excited to fish, but really felt like if i got totally skunked again I wasnt gonna believe that they existed...but i was proven wrong, they do exist  my first (hopefully not last) Laketrout  images hosting  we managed to go 2 for 5...we are still learning how to recognize that these fish are on because they never seem to break off the clip no matter how light we set them...further testing required.  it was beauty out there though i tell ya  images hosting  back to the cottage we went and dave made a mid week trip up...here it was in all its glory, my official bass season from start to finish in a span of 4 days...just before dave arrived i went for quick troll down the shorline to cast some weed beds when i had a personal first...spinner bait...thump set the hook...oh look its a smallie...it fights....ZIP BOOOOM my bass gets absolutely crushed by a 35+ inch gator..i fight the pike for a few seconds it finally lets go and i land my bass...hes a bit beat up  images hosting  dave and i head out the next day and put 12 hours in on the water, we probably boated over 40 smallies but only managed one ""good one""  images hosting  boy the numbers were there in force but we just couldnt break that 4lb mark  the next day and different spots was much of the same...dave and i probably caught close to 80 bass over two days but just couldnt get the size we wanted...i even lost one that we were sure was 5lbs but it just wasnt meant to be. We had fun none the less.  During my time at the cottage my parents had notified me of their plans to actually come visit me out in vancouver along with some friends and most importantly make a trip up to Masset Haida Gwaii where my uncle makes his annual pilgrimage from edmonton to hunt salmon. My parents informed me that they had a spare room in the house they were renting so for the price of airfaire i was set up for a fishing trip with boat and accommodations included...i couldn't go wrong!  Haida Gwaii is what I would describe as one of the most natural rugged wild places I have ever been. You really feel like you are travelling back in time when you go there. What other place can you go and troll world class salmon waters while also seeing whales, porpoises, sea lions, seals and bald eagles fly around like common sea gulls...pretty friggin cool. There were points when the pods of whales had moved in that I was seeing groups of over 15 whales all around us breaching and blowing out while also hooking into salmon...pretty friggin cool.  Ill let the pictures do the place justice for the most part. Im not a huge fish fan by any means...but every meal we ate came from the ocean  my first chicken (halibut)  images hosting  solid coho  images hosting  masset harbour an active commercial fishery, these boats dump water out the sides to feed the live wells full of crabs  i  rainforests on tow hill  images hosting  mages hosting  north beach as seen from the top of tow hill a dormant volcano that was cut in half by a glacier  images hosting  folks on the west coast dont mess around when it comes to gear...Gloomis rods, islander moochers was the set up...damn they were a joy to fish...for all you spoon pullers out there, give a moocher a try, i doubt youd ever go back to round reels  images hosting  bald eagles looking more like common seagulls friggin absolutely everywhere and noisey as all heck!  images hosting  pops with a big pink (thanks ritchie)  images hosti  ng  The sand beaches near tow hill are absolutely loaded with razor clams..i missed the dig as i was out fishing but partook in the cleaning and eating   im not a huge clam guy, but the sauce they were in was awesome and so was the native sea grass that our friend put on it...kinda tastes like a salty chive...damn good  images hosting  the trip wore down with slower fishing that my uncle liked...we averaged about 7 fish a day so everyones freezers got somewhat stocked...speaking with guides they feel like the water temperatures are much higher than normal (thanks global warming) and thus the fishing reflected this oddity. We only managed two hali's for the week and no tyee. I infact caught the biggest salmon of the trip...i still had fun regardless...and this albino spring put a work on me  images hosting  and thus i went back to the stinky city to live like a normal human...  now its time to get one on the fly i say...soon enough...soon enough  thanks for reading"
977654,BassMan11,2016-07-26 00:35:00,583,Great report. Very nice season so far!
977679,wormdunker,2016-07-26 05:34:00,1711,Awesome report!  I love your photos.  Especially the walleye.  I'm a walleye guy
977686,craigdritchie,2016-07-26 11:04:00,1586,"pops with a chinny  images hosti   Not a chinny. Look at the tail. That, the shape of the head, and no spots on the back all say pops has a really nice pink salmon. In the Pacific they don't get a whole lot bigger than that, so it really is a nice fish - I'd take that over a chinny of the same size any day. Congrats to pops!  Nice report. Love the walleyes too!  "
977691,Sterling,2016-07-26 12:31:00,477," we managed to go 2 for 5...we are still learning how to recognize that these fish are on because they never seem to break off the clip no matter how light we set them...further testing required.   Check these out; http://dev.downriggerrelease.com/products.html  Apparently they work awesome. You can set individual tension for bite vs rod. 0.5lbs vs 4.5lbs for example. I have 2 in the mail, picking them up tonight. Their stackers also look amazing."
977694,leaf4,2016-07-26 13:06:00,2466,Nice report! The water clarity in that river is amazing! And the fish are nice to boot   Also nice job with the bathroom... It's almost identical to the main floor Reno I just completed on mine in terms of size/layout
977700,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-26 13:30:00,8243,"Man what a great report. Now at least I know how to pronounce your handle. I might have an idea as to what it means too.  You really remind me of me 30 years ago. If I wasn't fishing I was doing reno's on my days off. If that's you with the dark hair and beard you even look like me 30 years ago. edit: I think that's Dave.  Great tile job on the washroom. I can't see behind the tile to say good job there though.  Congrats on the engagement, now I'll tell you what I say to every newly engaged guy. Buy the best quality rec room furniture you can. For us that have been divorced you know what I mean."
977702,Freshtrax,2016-07-26 14:05:00,2215,"You have been busy,   Some says I wish I could just pick up and move to the mountains, I love it out there."
977704,BillM,2016-07-26 14:47:00,17367,"Right on man!!!  Glad to hear you're making the most out of your time out West.    That stream looks incredible.    Go find some bull trout and toss big streamers at them, that should keep you busy for a while"
977718,Rod Caster,2016-07-26 16:37:00,5784,"Yeah, that gin-clear stream is ridiculous. Great report... Mr. Adventure you are"
977720,PUMP KNOWS,2016-07-26 16:40:00,937,Awesome report!  I wish I could have those type of adventures.
977740,manitoubass2,2016-07-26 20:59:00,11391,Damn son!!!!  Thats one heck of a report!  I wear my hat so tilted that I walk with a hunch  Awesome fish and scenery!!!
977743,misfish,2016-07-26 21:14:00,29133,Great report and this is golden     Thanks for taking the time.

I have 2 in the mail, picking them up tonight. Their stackers also look amazing. We actually had these come stock with the scotties...what we didnt like was the requirement to put a loop in the line before placing them in the rigger. It always sketched us out especially if it is rough reaching out to the ball and making a loop in the line. We are heavily considering it though especially for calm days.  Part of the problem is that we are also ""over geared"" a bit for these smaller lakers. Our stuff is more salmon based trolling gear. Nice report! The water clarity in that river is amazing! And the fish are nice to boot   Also nice job with the bathroom...

Yes thats Dave with the beard lol. Not a lot of work was required behind the tile besides putting in rockboard and running a couple of new lines to the sink and the shower. Easy stuff mainly!  Good call on the furniture ahhaa I will keep that in mind. Right on man!!!  Glad to hear you're making the most out of your time out West.    That stream looks incredible.    Go find some bull trout and toss big streamers at them, that should keep you busy for a while Heading out this weekend hopefully...lets see what i can figure out!

977835,bare foot wader,2016-07-27 19:17:00,1354,"sweet report, nice fish, especially the chicken, perfect eating size and won't kill your arms to bring it in lol  just FYI there is an organized fishing protest for the recreational fraser chinook fishery happening Aug 1, if you're into that sort of thing"
977842,fishindevil,2016-07-27 20:28:00,6254,awesome report and pics !!!! you sure did some great multi species fishing for sure....check out blacks releases almost the same as the one pictured above but they have been around forever and still work the best....  cheers
977879,spincast,2016-07-28 10:08:00,3279,very cool - awesome collection of fish and places. Thanks for sharing
