While the kids and wife are chilling with friends, I plan to sneak away and do some fishing with the guys, however I have no idea on the area or whether there is a possibility of fishing from shore.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  "

Another spot a little drive away to the East of Turkey Point is the village of Normandale, there is a small concrete pier there that I use to fish off and a small creek runs into the lake on the East side of the pier. I have seen small mouth, perch, pan fish and even the odd rainbow caught here."
