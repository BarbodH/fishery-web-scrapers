977528,Freshtrax,2016-07-24 19:31:00,2215,it's no secret it's been a great year out on Lake Ontario with big fish being caught from Whitby to Hamilton.     It's been mostly a spoon bite for us all season with the odd fish on the fly.   I haven't got out as much  as last year but still managing to get out for a morning every week.   Here's a few of the better fish from the last 2 weeks.   Also got my first unicorn he was a baby so he got a quick unhook and release.             
977540,ckewley,2016-07-24 21:15:00,699,"Was out of Grimsby today & man was it ever on fire. Boated over 30 fish with the best being a 29lb king, 10 matures ranging from 18-29. A whack ton of Coho's (a few really nice ones)& a few bows, don't think a single fish under 5lbs. Most fish caught on meat today. "
977542,Freshtrax,2016-07-24 21:18:00,2215,Dammit ... I had a weird feeling and almost ran to grimsby this morning.    Nice shooting .  We stayed on the north shore and went 6-6   Before the wind picked up.

977548,Rizzo,2016-07-24 23:25:00,4754,wow. I tried the salmon thing for the first time  week ago with  buddy who is just getting into it...went 4 for 7. Like it so much I bought some dipseys and went in my boat a few days later...3 for 4! Nice to find some fishing I enjoy close to home. Usually its a long haul and a long day out and back to st clair. This is a nice alternative...especially if I start to see the success you guys are having
977557,spincast,2016-07-25 00:26:00,3279,nice shooting Andrew. That Tyee will make an appearance soon - give them another month of feeding and those 23lber's will be there.
977584,Freshtrax,2016-07-25 14:00:00,2215,No kidding we fish the morning from 6-11 and home by 12 .  Wife barely notices I'm missing.

977614,Lucky Linda,2016-07-25 18:53:00,93,"I have had some great luck out of Bluffers...no monsters yet, but a solid list of 17-22lbs. Heading back this week to see if I too can find that illusive 30lb King.  Lucky Linda "
977675,captpierre,2016-07-26 03:13:00,2521,Fished Bluffers Monday evening. 4 shakers only. Lots of bait in close on way in. Should have concentrated more shallow.
977676,Freshtrax,2016-07-26 04:29:00,2215,I haven't marked any bait since April. Am starting to wonder what these things eat
977705,BillM,2016-07-26 14:49:00,17367,"I might get down to the big lake this weekend, we'll see what the weather is like."
977708,Freshtrax,2016-07-26 15:32:00,2215,Doesn't look promising right now with sustained east winds....but we all know how that goes I will check the forcast Friday.

978016,Freshtrax,2016-07-29 17:31:00,2215,I get to paint cupboards all weekend.
978022,BillM,2016-07-29 17:59:00,17367,"Sounds like we're both going to be having lots of fun, lol!"
978030,Freshtrax,2016-07-29 19:42:00,2215,Monday mornings not out of the question yet.   I'm keeping my eye on it....we may drive down to Hamilton and fish the harbour for pike/walleye if it's too rough to get out.
