Preferably looking at the kawarthas, is it possible to just pull up to any island and set up camp? Any permits needed? I swear there was a thread about this not long ago but I cant find it. Any suggestions are appreciated.. thanks!"
977989,Korber,2016-07-29 12:59:00,79,"Quite a few provincial parks up that way, as far as I recall being told by a park employee they are mandated to keep a certain amount of their camp sites available for ""walk-in's"". They will show either booked or unavailable to be booked online. Might be a fun idea to make a list of the ones you like and head out on an adventure."
977992,John Bacon,2016-07-29 13:45:00,3277,If the island is crown land then you can legally camp there.  There is a limit for how long you can use a spot on crown land; but I think it's about 21 days.  You may have trouble getting a spot on the weekend; but during the week should be fine.
