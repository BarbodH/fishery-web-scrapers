977867,GBW,2016-07-28 02:22:00,8460,I'm off Fri and hope to get over to my folks lake for a few hours!  then working all weekend...  *sigh*
977875,Tjames09,2016-07-28 04:50:00,664,"Fishing Saturday to Tuesday on Sturgeon, should be good!!!"
977878,Mister G,2016-07-28 09:55:00,1429,Four walleyes yesterday on old man Erie......
977891,AKRISONER,2016-07-28 13:49:00,5558,"Fishing Saturday to Tuesday on Sturgeon, should be good!!! catch a million bass and spend at least 1 of those full days casting blades for skis"
978099,GBW,2016-07-30 18:05:00,8460,Got out yesterday for a bit with my sister and the lake was HOT (79*) and all we could find was decent bass on senko type baits.  biggest bass of the day was mid 3's and either just attacked pre hooking it or attacked during the fight as it has cuts on both sides from teeth.
978100,Spiel,2016-07-30 19:09:00,9065,"Shhhh, don't tell anyone I was up north for a week of hot Laker fishing.  "
978101,GBW,2016-07-30 19:32:00,8460,Nice! This was our day 
978107,Steelheadphycho,2016-07-30 22:00:00,470,One eye is better than no eye! 
978113,misfish,2016-07-30 22:24:00,29133,"Shhhh, don't tell anyone I was up north for a week of hot Laker fishing.     Nice one Chris   Nice! This was our day  Quick pic before the quick release? LOL   One eye is better than no eye!   Nice eye Sir."
978114,GBW,2016-07-30 22:26:00,8460,"Quick pic before the quick release? LOL The small one was ideal for a snack as she wanted one, the other was not going to last in the lake (see gut gash) so she took it too."
978125,manitoubass2,2016-07-31 00:10:00,11391,"Sweet, now everyone just posts a quick snippet in this thread lol"
978137,Tjames09,2016-07-31 01:56:00,664,Well aside from my boat motor dieing today's fishing was amazing. Boated 4 muskies. Two of them caught on bass gear fishing for bass with senkos. Muskies were aggressive today. One was pulled in on 20lb line with an 8lb leader and spinning gear. Although it got  a bit annoying as we were trying to fish for bass and Muskies kept eating my lures and line. Lost 3 lures from Muskies today.
978140,GBW,2016-07-31 02:13:00,8460,"Sweet, now everyone just posts a quick snippet in this thread lol that's all I planned to do all a long..."
977478,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-24 02:33:00,8243,"I would think by this time of the year more and more fishin' reports would have graced our pages.  I did get 3 nice Walleye this week (nada yesterday) off of Nanticoke at an average of 8 lbs, each. I have pics but need to post them. 8 colours of lead core with all 3 hitting the Reef Runners. Purple and brown in about 70' down 30' . Overcast skies, I like the darker colours in an overcast. Nothing on harnesses.  I really enjoy some political stuff but after all it is fishing season.  Johnny D"
977480,manitoubass2,2016-07-24 02:56:00,11391,As soon as im off work brotha!  The river is looking prime for some bassin!  Gonna hit the clearwater chain of lakes for sure also
977482,Tjames09,2016-07-24 03:02:00,664,"  Did pretty good last weekend on Sturgeon. 3 Muskies, 1 walleye (not fishing for them), and a bunch of LMB and 1 SMB."
977484,Gallie,2016-07-24 03:13:00,1215,"I had to work today so no salmon fishin for me bud, will report next weekend."
977485,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-24 03:37:00,8243,"Working is no excuse not to fish. I swear if anyone walked into my hovel of an office and said they wanted the weekend off to go fishing I would have said yes. But they didn't, including saying they were kidnapped on May 24 weekend (walleye opening at his cottage) and couldn't escape until Tuesday. That was fun."
977491,manitoubass2,2016-07-24 10:29:00,11391,I wish it were that way. My replacement flys in though so im sure my boss wouldnt be too cool with it(right now)  Hes had minor surgery too so my 14 days on got alot longer.  But im bassin wednesday regardless???
977493,mike rousseau,2016-07-24 11:36:00,4661,There you go  I threw one up there for you
977495,wormdunker,2016-07-24 11:50:00,1711,"I would be happy to post a report but, first I have to catch one!  LOL! I did catch a few up in Ear Falls.  Also since arriving home July 4 I have managed 5 different trips on Erie.  Twice out to Mohawk Point area got skunked both times & marking very few fish.  I'm now concentrating on the Port Colborne area.  Caught 1 walleye on 3 different occasions."
977503,Canuck2fan,2016-07-24 14:08:00,1444,"Fishing reports I can do catching reports is another thing entirely...  WORST PERCH season ever on Lake Erie from the pier I am always 10 minutes, an hour or a day late when it comes to being there when they are biting.  Not too mention the great minnow scandal of 2016... All I hear is someone sold their bait business to someone and that person who bought it is unable, unwilling or incapable of supplying bait shops. Of course the record high winds are a big part of the problem as well.  Usually bait shops being out is not a problem as I like to catch to my own but this year 100's of pulls with the net have yielded maybe 5 dozen minnows over 10 trips.  I did get 4 perch with the 6 minnows I caught yesterday no pics though I didn't want to waste the SD card space with the pitiful nature of the result. LOL"
977568,Beans,2016-07-25 02:51:00,3339,Uncle Dave and I did some shore fishing last Thursday morning before it got too hot...1 9 inch perch 1 large worlds greatest and about a 2 pound largie was all that was worth mentioning...LOL
977572,GBW,2016-07-25 03:57:00,8460,I have a date later in the week...  that's all I got...
977573,GBW,2016-07-25 03:59:00,8460,vertigo type problems keep you off the water and even casting off the dock at times isn't the best if windy.  my cell was 75' away in the house/cottage just in case I fell in on Sat...  Only a few small SMB on Sat when stuck on the dock...
977580,Sterling,2016-07-25 11:56:00,477," Usually bait shops being out is not a problem as I like to catch to my own but this year 100's of pulls with the net have yielded maybe 5 dozen minnows over 10 trips.  Maybe I'll post something about minnow trapping one of these days. I did that as a summer student for a number of years, learned quite a bit about it.  Can't help with the throw net though."
977581,Dara,2016-07-25 12:22:00,3052,I haven't been out lately but I'm heading to NWT Thursday for a couple weeks so with any luck I will get a fish or 2 to post.

But they didn't, including saying they were kidnapped on May 24 weekend (walleye opening at his cottage) and couldn't escape until Tuesday. That was fun. Man I wish I worked for you. Although, some of the field guys here (surveyors) take their rods with them so if they're at a remote location or somewhere near a pond or river they will go fishing on their lunch breaks. I love it when they come in to my office at the end of the day and show me pictures of all the rainbows and browns they found on some of these properties (mildly sarcastic/mostly jealous).  Honestly though, I haven't had much time this summer to go fishing. I think I've been out once since I went to our annual fishing camp trip. The baby bass we caught that day weren't really worthy of a report! lol."

977594,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-25 16:39:00,8243,"  I see that Vertigo is terrible. A good pal out here has it too. He owns 2 nice boats for the big waters here, a 21 foot StarCraft centre council and a 28 foot Grew. He has gone out exactly 1 time this year because of it. Dr's just keep changing his meds and they are done with it.    I have heard the horror stories. My old GF that eventually became Divisional Superintendent where you are got a 3 week unpaid suspension as well as a Foreman 2 weeks off for ""Payroll Fraud"". The very first week I got a Foreman's job we went from the plant to Point Abino to do chores at the Super's cottageI always paid OT to someone that was willing to work it at the rate of pay that he owned even though he covered a lesser paying job rate. Or when we asked guys to go on days on Special Duties to do WHIMIS training and things that had to be done and pay him or her their job rate. I would have been fired by the Yanks if I stayed until they took over, or charged with assault. The General Shift Foreman could not make a simple decision there without the OK from Pittsburg. I would have lost it. Chin up Pics, gew got a job mang."
977647,DaveRoach,2016-07-25 23:18:00,202,"Well I was going to wait til my lake of the woods trip in August, but here's a few of the skis I've landed this summer       Apologize for quality but they were selfies taken on Iphone timer. All from kawarthas  Will post a detailed report after my trip.  Cheers"
977665,GBW,2016-07-26 01:43:00,8460,Thanks pics and OL for the info.
977725,Mister G,2016-07-26 17:43:00,1429,Fishing Sunday on Ontario produced 4 kings but none very big........but my daughter in-law wanted salmon steaks and fillets so now she's got them.  Erie has been slow..........grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
977841,Canuck2fan,2016-07-27 20:17:00,1444," Maybe I'll post something about minnow trapping one of these days. I did that as a summer student for a number of years, learned quite a bit about it.  Can't help with the throw net though.  If I were fitter and younger I would have went after a ""bait licence"" I knew an acquaintance was getting out of a few years back.... As it was explained to me at the time, BIG RISKS, back breaking hard work would usually earn a medium sized reward.  Too many factors determine your ability to go out to catch and keep the bait in prime condition for resale, Fuel was only going up mostly at that time, vehicle insurance was soaring, but the 5 bucks a scoop was NEVER EVER  to change or you were going to be called a crook. LOL."
977843,KLINKER,2016-07-27 20:29:00,256,Should be able to go fishing as soon as the farm is completely burned up.
977853,misfish,2016-07-27 22:19:00,29133,"My 5 day long weekend starts at 12 midnight. Heading north at the strike of 4am, probly be earlier, as I will be up at 3.LOL. What happens after that well, only I know. Going to try and keep Simcoe to one day.. TRY."
