976616,206,2016-07-15 02:04:00,563,A discussion on Facebook has lead to a lead on live target lures for $5.00 at Midland Crappy Tire. The person claims they are still on sale I found this link http://midlandads.simcoe.com/midland-on/communication/department-stores/canadian-tire-midland-store/2016-06-30-3593401-midland-friday-july-1st-until-thursday-july-7th-2016-open-canadian-canada-tire-day-8am-6pm-while-quantities-last-no-rainchecks-dot-midland-store-only-contd-coleman-8-childrens-sleepover-camping-kit-person-yurt-includes-tent-sleeping-bag-  Any one else noticed similar sale at your local stores?  
976622,PUMP KNOWS,2016-07-15 03:23:00,937,Maybe we can price match?
976625,BowSlayer101,2016-07-15 03:39:00,296,It ended on the 8th and saids on the link only in midland store....
976629,Canuck,2016-07-15 10:22:00,491,"The sale seems to move around.  There was a similar ""bin"" sale in Oakville earlier in the summer.  I picked up a few at $4.99, including a bright yellow jointed perch that seems to be VERY attractive to the pike in the spots I have fished this year."
976722,Dabluz,2016-07-16 03:40:00,701,Live Target lures sell for 14.99 in my region.
976727,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-16 05:43:00,8243,"You can keep them IMO. If anyone wants them cheap, less than 10 bucks a guy usually sells them at The Stelco Fishing Club meetings and the Hamilton Swap meet. Contact Fish Farmer for dates."
976756,GBW,2016-07-16 16:25:00,8460,Seen some in a bin beside the counter at the Lindsay store a week or so ago and didn't check the price as I have some and never use them.
977001,riddickulous,2016-07-19 03:22:00,27,"It ended on the 8th and saids on the link only in midland store....  Went by the Midland store yesterday and they're selling for $6.49. Mostly crawfish, some sunfish, shad, smelt."
977003,Steve,2016-07-19 03:24:00,2075,"had eyes peel/fall of the shad's, but the smelts are great lures!!!"
977021,PUMP KNOWS,2016-07-19 14:37:00,937,I'd be all over this if I can find them in the GTA.
977204,wildeye rainbow,2016-07-21 01:56:00,123,"If they had any of those 4.99 Live Target jointed smelts down here in St Thomas, I would snap them up.  The one that I used this spring in the Loring area was on fire for 'eyes.  PK"
977205,Dabluz,2016-07-21 02:26:00,701,"Here in my region, the Live Target smelt (the small one) is fantastic for landlocked salmon.  Walleye love them too.  There are smelt in all of the large bodies of water in my region."
977235,PUMP KNOWS,2016-07-21 15:28:00,937,My first fish I caught with the jointed smelt was my first Musky

There are smelt in all of the large bodies of water in my region. I think the new Live Target Dace baits are going to be killer speck magnets!"
977662,buick14,2016-07-26 01:35:00,741,I have no issues with live target.  Some don't like being used with a snap but I really like some of their baits Muskoka CT had them from $4.99-8.99 on sale select versions
