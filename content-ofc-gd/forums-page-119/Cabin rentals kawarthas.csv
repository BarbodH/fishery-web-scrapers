977022,Tom McCutcheon,2016-07-19 14:55:00,627,Two locations which come to mind that I can recommend. Both are well run and maintained.  Scotsman Point Resort on Buckhorn Lake  Pine Vista Resort on Stony Lake.
977028,Mister G,2016-07-19 15:29:00,1429,"Riverside is nice ""IF"" you can get into it......covered boat house is really really nice to have.......and your in a protected area plus many things to do there for the family.  http://mbruun04.wix.com/riversidelodge"

977059,Old Ironmaker,2016-07-19 20:51:00,8243,"I was going to recommend cottages the boys and I stayed at on Clear Lake, quick access to great fishing too. Now I find out they sold it and someone built a mansion there, sad to see."
977062,Tom McCutcheon,2016-07-19 20:59:00,627,"Thanks guys I will check those out I need something wife friendly where I can do some musky fishing.  If you go with Scotsman Point, there is lots of things nearby for the wife to do while you look for Muskies..... Like a small winery, antique shops in town etc. etc."
977066,porkpie,2016-07-19 21:29:00,2521,3 castles resort lower buckhorn.
977214,i2cool2fool,2016-07-21 05:26:00,349,I am staying here now actually with my family. We love it and plan to return next year. I first came here last May for walleye opener and had to come back.
977234,jimmer,2016-07-21 15:15:00,2730,Availability could be an issue in the better places. Camp Ashstabula on Pigeon Lake used to be nice.
