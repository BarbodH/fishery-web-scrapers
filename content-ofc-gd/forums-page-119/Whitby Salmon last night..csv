977240,captpierre,2016-07-21 17:10:00,2521,Used to fish Lake O a lot. Now the boat lives at the cottage. A buddy and I went out last evening out of Whitby harbour. Marked no bait. A few hooks. Caught 1 25 lb plus King  in Bullfrog  SD and green fly on Dypsy and braid. Moderate sea fleas. Guys we met at launch just 2 bows. They had 14 in the boat yesterday am. Seems to be a good year on the north shore. Get out there if you can.
977268,Carp,2016-07-22 03:42:00,1488,Last year was the first time in 30 years I didn't get on the big lake at least once. I will get out there one day soon to pursue the mighty kings again.  Thanks for the report. Cheers !

977327,BillM,2016-07-22 20:34:00,17367,Been a slammer on the North shore this year for sure.  Can't wait until they start staging and I can go cast glow spoons at night
