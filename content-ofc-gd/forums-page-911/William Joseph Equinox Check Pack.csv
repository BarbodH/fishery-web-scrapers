294024,okumasheffield,2009-01-18 13:33:00,318,Does anyone happen to know if William Joseph  Equinox chest pack has two stripes around the waist or just single stripe??  I am concerned about the weight balancing issue ... seems to me having just one stripe around waist is going to make the pack swingning around  Any tackle shops in Ontario have it?
