I was approached by a fella doing a article on Urban Fisheries and l'm trying to locate some of the posts I did on fishing the GTA from the Old Board. Rick, Roy... is this still possible? I remember someone posting some kind of search for the Pro-Board. Is this option still avalible? Also when I do a search on myself here on this board it only goes so far back. Is there a way to find some of these older posts?   FHR"
