293704,Bernie,2009-01-17 18:54:00,3190,"Borrowed a shack from my uncle. This one hasn't been on the ice for about ten years. Just sitting there adding more spider webs each year. It was pointing the wrong way for the skis and they were frozen down. So a few 2x4's and a pry bar managed to get it turned around. I was a little worried about the condition of it and whether it would stand the shaking but it made the trip OK. This shack has to be minimum 40 years old and ""if it could talk could tell a story or two"".     Got it into place with the door facing east.     Able to see it from the cottage. Joe will be able to walk back early to make us lunch.   Not too far away from the Ice Bungalows   Just have to fire up the antique Jiffy and a bag of minnows and away we go."

Lots of times when Im driving around and see old farm homes all boarded up, I think to myself, I wonder what happen back then."
