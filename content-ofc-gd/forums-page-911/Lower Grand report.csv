Arrived at Fishmasters at 7am on the dot,  first thought was this ain't no cooks bay.  Parking was about 500feet from the ice.. Ahhh when your pulling your pack this was half the distance you walk just too get parking at cooks  So meet Steve (fishmaster) got some tips bait and we headed out with high hopes.   After unpacking and setting up in the cold we started to fish, We were marking tones of fish some big some small.  There were a few hook ups but nothing lasting longer than a few seconds.. I call it a learning experience.  But!  did catch this beauty, and no it was not on there when I put it down      Over all a great day on the lower grand with cold gusty winds the moved my hut with me in it   but the great company and learning made it well worth the effort.  Thanks Lexx"
