Also, what favourite artificials do you recommend?  Is there ever a time when artificials are better than live minnows?  Favourite jig colour and size?  I have some of those tastey looking white tub jigs and some trout attractant ina  bottle.  do you recomend using this to jig with rather than minnows?  sorry for so many questions but I'm running a  pretty bad skunk streak and I need to loose the stink real fast.  thanks,  James"
