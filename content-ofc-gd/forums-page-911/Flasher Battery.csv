293264,nodie,2009-01-16 20:04:00,34,Where could I buy a flasher battery close to Ottawa?  Thanks!
293273,Doctrt,2009-01-16 20:20:00,141,If I remember correctly that is a 12 volt 7ahr sealed lead acid battery.  The best price I've found for that one is at a place called TorBram.  The ones I know about are in Pickering and Whitby and they're $22.  Or you could go to the Source and pay $59 for the  same thing. Good Luck. T

293322,irishfield,2009-01-16 22:36:00,26272,Sometimes a hard find. Our local electric supplier.. Ideal.. doesn't carry them in stock.. but the local alarm place does for $$'s.  I ordered mine online -  Two x 8ah-12v for $37 and $13 shipping from Saskatchewan... so $25 each without leaving my chair and a trip to the post office to pick up.

293334,irishfield,2009-01-16 22:58:00,26272, Yah they do... but they are generally time x'd items out of some foreclosure etc. I've made the mistake of buying PA batteries and had them DOA !
293339,Sinker,2009-01-16 23:09:00,8692,"Most places use them for back up emergency lighting. If there is a place that deals with that kind of stuff around ottawa, check there as well.  There is an OSSO electric in Kingston.....but still a little far I guess?  Sinker"
