294055,limeyangler,2009-01-18 15:16:00,5204,"Q-Tips up yer nostrils works!  Seriously though, they do smell strongly, kinda put me off eating them the first time i caught some..but they taste so good i dont mind the smell anymore, i wash my hands with dish soap, and my wife is used to it....lol"

293480,douG,2009-01-17 04:05:00,2693,"Are you saying that you had 'seemingly congress' with a skunk, or that you were fishing and didn't catch anything, or that not catching anything is typical (like me)?  Jes' wonderin'."
293488,codered,2009-01-17 04:17:00,123,im saying i caught a wack of witie with 3 guys spent 2 hours cleaning them  i stinklike white  cant wash away that dirty smell . i may have to sleep on the couch...lol
293490,Sinker,2009-01-17 04:20:00,8692,Rub your hands on the stainless steel on your sink. Wash your hands with lemon juice. Vinegar works ok too.  I like the smell of whities......kinda like fresh cucumbers.......or smelts  Sinker
293549,wallacio,2009-01-17 12:46:00,475, Good suggestions....toothpaste works as well!
293550,Greencoachdog,2009-01-17 13:03:00,8163,I second toothpaste.
293551,Billy Bob,2009-01-17 13:04:00,5865,Just wash you hands with COLD water and salt. Warm/hot water opens the pores in your skin so use COLD water.
293558,bigugli,2009-01-17 13:35:00,6138,What's wrong with smelling like fish?
293562,johnnyb,2009-01-17 13:56:00,3413,"This won't help now, but, NEXT time, just wear some latex.  Gloves.  When you're cleaning the fish."
293573,john vail,2009-01-17 14:30:00,67,"Question on the toothpaste, is that before or after you use it"
293576,Greencoachdog,2009-01-17 14:37:00,8163,   I don't really think it matters... do you Chief?
293601,River Rat,2009-01-17 15:36:00,161,go catch some lakers....change up that stink!  RR
293626,Zubris21,2009-01-17 16:14:00,563,I second the stainless steel.  just rub your hands on the faucet or sink.  Another fav when Im camping is the grab a bunch of pine needles and rub them through my hands to mask/get rid of the smell.
293632,Beans,2009-01-17 16:22:00,3339,Wash your hands with a blob of ketchup...
293727,codered,2009-01-17 20:03:00,123,lol  it was a combonation  was out with 3 friends cleaned 6 whitfish 4 trout ..Im the only one who can clean them without geting bones.  Thx for all the help guys  the smell is gone  at least for now  and I think its always better to smell like  a fish than a skunk....
293728,mikeh,2009-01-17 20:10:00,824,"BUY THE HAND SANITIZER FROM SHOPPERS DRUGMART, IT'S A LITTLE PAINFUL IF YOU HAVE ANY CUTS ON YOUR HANDS BUT IT WORKS GREAT,THE COST IS ABOUT $6"
293736,misfish,2009-01-17 20:50:00,29133,Whitefish smell is the best.
293770,Ramble,2009-01-17 22:50:00,713,"i wouldnt worry about it too much. That's the smell of success. As for your buddies, teach them to Fillet. I've tought 1 or too i fish with too fillet, after doing a bunch of fish myself. Teaching to fillet properly is better quicker then doing it yourself al the time lol  Still its good to hear you were into the fish.  -R-"
293792,centerpin_drift,2009-01-17 23:52:00,94,"whitefish smell good, why would you wanna get rid of that smell.. its like a cologne"
293802,Joey,2009-01-18 00:24:00,9122,Lemon juice works.  Joey
293881,richyb,2009-01-18 02:26:00,774,rubbing alcohol
293890,Shelley Cooper,2009-01-18 02:40:00,394,I'm with Beans and anyone else... KETCHUP ALL THE WAY....
293902,Beans,2009-01-18 02:59:00,3339,I learned that from you Shelley...LOL
293906,buckster,2009-01-18 03:04:00,530,Im now sure how to wash it away........ but i usually wash it down with a few coors light..... not sure if that helps!
293929,forrest,2009-01-18 03:43:00,1032, I second the stainless steel thing....thats why fishing stores sell stainless steel soap bars. Lemon juice sounds good too. Top it off with some vinegar to help with smell.
