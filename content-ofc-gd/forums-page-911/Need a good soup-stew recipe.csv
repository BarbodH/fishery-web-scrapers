Thanks for the confidence vote, Joe.  I hope it worked out well.  If I don't have some fresh bread handy to serve along side, some egg noodles make a comforting companion.  I bet the puff pastry added a nice crunch to the gravy.  Now I'm hungry."
293307,Big Cliff,2009-01-16 22:01:00,6899,"OK, this is one that I don't usually share with anyone other than at our dinner table. The history is simple; we were out for dinner one evening at a ""Fine Dining"" place and one of the things on the menu was a ""cream of garlic soup"". Everyone that tried it loved it so I being me, decided ""I can make this"" (Famous last words)LOL.  Anyway, it took me a while but here is my version of it and I haven't had many complaints; I hope you enjoy:  Take 4 or 5 Buds (no not cloves) of garlic, peal off the outer (loose skin) Cut off about 1/4 of an "" off the top of the bud. (I save all the little pieces of garlic that I can out of the tops and throw them into the sauce pan later)  Place them upright in a baking dish and drizzle with about 2 tbs of olive oil over the tops. preheat oven to 350F and bake for about 1 hr until golden brown. Remove and let cool. When the garlic is cool enough to handle; press the individual garlic cloves between the thumb and finger to squeeze out the garlic.  In a large sauce pan: combine the garlic,  2 1/2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup of white wine. Bring it to a boil then reduce heat and simmer about 30 minutes. Then stir in 2 1/2 cups whole milk, 1 cup heavy whipping cream, and 1/2 cup pealed and cubed potatoes (salt and pepper to taste) and simmer another 30 minutes.  Puree soup in a blender, return to sauce pan adjust salt and pepper, and simmer. Ladel into bowls and serve with buttered French bread.  Now, if you want the most decadent seafood chowder, just add about 1 cup small salid shrimp and 1 cup baby scalops after pureeing and just simmer long enough to JUST cook the scalops. (You could use any fish cut into cubes).  Enjoy!"
293374,Canuck2fan,2009-01-17 00:45:00,1444,"This the ultimate comfort food recipe.... 1.5 lb of ANY ground meat browned with a small onion diced. I have used beef, turkey, pork, veal. I have even used cooked salmon flaked with a bit of green onion 8 slices of cooked bacon crumbled or 4ozs of diced ham I have even used coined up pillars hot pepperettes to add a bit of spice.  Place them in a 9in deep pie plate Shread 6oz of your favourite cheese and put over the meat.  In a 2CUP measuring cup take 1/2 cup of any egg based salad dressing. I like using half mayonaisse and half PC salsa ranch salad dressing. Add 4 eggs one at at time beating throughly with a fork after each egg. Lastly blend in 1/2 cup of half and half. Pour the mixture over the meat and cheese and bake until set in preheated 375 F oven. Usually takes about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes and enjoy!!! This is excellent cold the next day with a salad as well.  I make this so often that when ground beef or pork is on sale I buy 10 to 15 lbs and brown it off and freeze it in 1 lb lots so I can throw this together even quicker."
