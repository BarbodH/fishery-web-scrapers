293294,FISHINGNUT,2009-01-16 21:32:00,253,Just wondering with these cold temps do you think it turns the bite OFF ?Air temps shouldnt affect the mood of the fish would it?  Just curious what anybody else thought
293299,joonmoon,2009-01-16 21:49:00,528,Air temp might not affect the bite but the barometric pressure changes sure will and sometimes wind as well depending on where you fish.
293300,Ramble,2009-01-16 21:53:00,713,"Not this time of year, as it doesnt influence water temperature. But in the summer...thats another story. THe high pressure associated with the cold we have should affect it.  -Dave"
293349,Sinker,2009-01-16 23:46:00,8692,Didn't seem to bother the fish the last 2 days on Simcoe!!  Sinker
293359,Ramble,2009-01-17 00:16:00,713,It's been set up for a few days
293367,mad_on_fishing,2009-01-17 00:31:00,21," exactly, my father is a meteorologist and we will look up the pressure . on days with high pressure, we fish slow, verry slow, and on days with low pressure, ye go it all!  also a local pro walleye angle thinks the same."
293368,LeXXington,2009-01-17 00:33:00,1928,colder temps mean less people -- better fishing

293479,Vanselena,2009-01-17 04:03:00,269,Did a long term study on this a few years back. Colder trends definitely chill the bite and Warming trends after a long cooling trend definitely heats up the bite.
293493,Sinker,2009-01-17 04:24:00,8692,"Doesn't matter if its cold or warm, as long as you've had stable weather for a few days in a row.  Sinker"
293497,buckster,2009-01-17 04:41:00,530,"i have to agree with sinker stable weather is what you want, be it hot or cold.   There are always active fish u just gotta find them!"
293502,e-z-out,2009-01-17 04:47:00,1052,I'll let you know tomorrow if i get onto any fish
293542,FISHINGNUT,2009-01-17 10:57:00,253,"Interesting input guys thanks,I will be out today to test the theory"
293572,Greencoachdog,2009-01-17 14:26:00,8163, Yup!!!    Yup Yup!!!
293709,e-z-out,2009-01-17 19:09:00,1052,Well just got back from the Bog and had no luck after 5 hours of fishing. Just befor we left we saw why we had a skie picking off the minnows. Myself and jigger had a good time even though we got skunked. there is always next weekend.
