293345,express168,2009-01-16 23:34:00,327,"  Hey ch312,  I agree with you, the sad part is that those sub-division homes are going to be the older resale homes of the future. I wonder what condition they will be in then?"
293362,Pinch,2009-01-17 00:21:00,231,"So basically what some people are saying here is that the homes which are built to code in sub divisions are crap, but the work that MH does which is above code is overkill?!?"
293447,mikeh,2009-01-17 02:57:00,824,"One of his best shows was when he went into a home in a newer subdivision and the poured concrete was eroding in a couple of spots, they tested the strength of the concrete which was supposed to be 15 and found it to be 7-8 , which explained why it was erroding."
293538,forrest,2009-01-17 09:32:00,1032,"Generally unqualified opinion: Sure, the paint jobs will often be low grade, the sub-floors are not as good as they used to be and carpet has always been cheap. Houses may be made differently now but at their core, when built right, they are good and sound at their core and will last.  A fix or upgrade hear and there and your good to go.  Me, a brand new home did not suit me.  Neither did one that was too old.  A lot of people are saying new subdivision homes are garbage.  This sounds like a stereotype.  forrest"

I have walked into homes less than a year old with floor tiles cracking and popping everywhere.. No builder in site either!  Showers that are molding up in less than a  year.  Tubs with atrocious caulking jobs.  Grout falling out of backsplashes.  Light coloured grout( the current fashion) being installed in high traffic areas that is filthy within months.  Clients not being told of upgrades available to prevent mold and stains.  Lifetime warranties not being offered, with a slight upgrade, to homeowners.  You name it,, I have seen it.

293561,bigugli,2009-01-17 13:47:00,6138," Actually, to correct the one misconception. Houses are not 2x4 construction. Exterior and weight bearing walls are 2x6 minimum. Partition walls are 2x4.  There is a huge variance in the quality of the framing lumber being used. A lot of green and warped wood used so it's tough to build a trued wall.  Some framers would cut and scab a stud to try and true a wall, I prefer to shave and shim."
293582,MAzing,2009-01-17 14:50:00,43,"I have been working in the new home industry for over 25 years. There is enough inspections mandated by governments to make sure your house is safe. So all structural, electical, mechanical and pluming should be safe.  Now the majority of the projects are crap, it's all about the mighty dollar and how fast they can slap them together. There is no concern about quality but lots about quatity. Sure they will build to code but nothing else maters so cosmetics will suffer.  Now I've spent the last 20 years working on custom homes and yes they are much better built then the projects but there are still some poor builders out there. I suggest you stay away form the larger builders as they are basicly project builders doing custon homes. A custom home should take at least 6 months to a year to be built properly, anything less will lead to poor workmanship.  I am in the finishing aspest of the game and it blows me away with the lact of perfection you see in these expensive homes. People would not buy a 20K car if it was full of dents and scratches or misallingned doors or bent dashboards but they will buy houses from 200k to millions and accept all these defects without exception.  I could not be a home builder as I don't think I can find a set of trades that would satisfy my quality demands. And if I did I would be costing the buyer 50 to 100% more then the next guy.  BTW I operate a business without advertising or even been listed in any phone book. I cost at least 20% more then the going rate and I have no problems finding work. I guess been a perfectionist has something to do with it. But even with my high standards I find myself doing sub par work these days as I cannot control all the trades before me as I'm not a miracle worker.  My one and only house was custom built 15 years ago and my next and last house will be custom built by me as a contractor.  And who is Mike Holmes?"
293585,Sinker,2009-01-17 14:53:00,8692,"I will say that alot of the crap jobs you see in  new home construction are due to poor concrete work. Off level, out of square, poor quality concrete, bearing points in the wrong spots etc. I find the closer you get to the GTA, the worse it is. Not so bad as you move east. There are a couple good concrete formers out here.  I've learned to stay away from some sites, just by checking out the foundations. Good forming usually helps make a better home. Some of the foundations I've seen, I wouldn't even touch. I actually made a site sign a waiver before I built a house for them, the concrete was that bad. I was on my way off the site, but this guy was almost crying to keep me there.......I know from the sill plate up, the house was solid, but under that......who knows.  I've seen some crazy crap in my time framing houses!!!! I""m glad I came to my senses and went back to school!!!  Sinker"
293774,ch312,2009-01-17 23:15:00,1590," i poured concrete basements, garages and porches for almost all of the builders in brantford for about 5 years. some of the crap that you see in most new homes (usually not custom) makes me sick to think that some poor sap is gonna spend $300k on a crappy house. all kinds of problems from the ground to roof top. i poured a pad for someone in a new subdivision this summer. the house is 2-3 years old and i believe there was 26 or so different issues that they found to try and get fixed under warranty.   i guess im lucky that ive only worked with good crews.  ive seen some pretty pathetic things when it comes to concrete but thats mostly due to the BUILDERS. ive seen a few builders become purple in the face from yelling so much when contractors refused to rush the job. i have personally witnessed footings being poured over mud, walls being poured 2 days after footings, and walls being stripped and back filled a couple days after pouring. turns out a whole wall fell over AFTER the house was framed  while working for a previous employer, we had to lay plywood on the MUD in the basement to pour the floor. some were less than 1"" of concrete in places while others were 16""+ in others. sometimes heaters would go down and builders would just say make it work...  if you refuse to work that day, you get fired.  i would never buy a new home...EVER. ive seen enough poop to say that they ALL sub divisions suck (except for custom)"

As a self emplyed contractor I think I do excellent work for reasonable prices. When I run across someone who is being cheap with me I walk the other way. They are a waste of my time, wont call them back, wont even give them a price. SEE YA! Find someone else!  I will agree however there are guys out there who do shotty work who shouldnt be in the contracting business.  MH goes overboard because the skies the limit on labour and material. Put him into the real world without all the sponsors and you may see a different story. I'm all for good workmanship and materials but the industry will only take so much.  BB"

I have worked in the new construction field, banging tin and putting in furnaces, in saying that. I would never buy a new home from certain builders. The way things are built to get them up in a hurry is shameful.That is one of the reasons i left, couldn't stand lowering my standards to meet theres! And theyare a huge company!! I recently went back to working in the re and re of old furnaces and find its 50/50 of the people who want to look over your shoulder while your working. I had one customer who ended with some stitches after watching me work. I was doing some gas piping on a water tank, i was bent over, the wrench slipped and the back of my head, made contact with his chin, i guarantee that he will never do that again!"

In other words they did what it took to do the job right and get the credentials. Our tech wing at school is filled with kids that think that they will work a trade so that means they don't have to apply themselves anywhere else (like English, science, or math). Meanwhile the best kids in tech class are the kids who hand in a great project whether it is a book case or a DNA model for science class. They care enough to take pride in what they do and do a good job (and learn). You want to find tomorrows best tradesmen, look in the academic wing. Jim"
292670,Abraxus,2009-01-15 15:55:00,104,"I do apologize to any tradesman by saying ""Most""  as I am a former tradesman myself.  I was a framer and a water proofing and restoration guy for about 14 years!  My issue is with how low the level of acceptability has sank when it comes to quality workmanship!  Don't you guys remember our fathers and uncles who use to work in the trades?  They use to build things as if they would be the ones to live in it themselves!  That sense of pride in what you do has somehow left the building industry.  Perhaps it has to do with costs, but I still think a trained professional should know how to use three tools which are very basic but were clearly absent in the building of my condo!  A Level, a plum bob and a framing square! Even the tradesmen on this site would agree that in recent years they must have seen some serious horror shows in what people call a finished product.  Its unacceptable and my point was and is, I am really happy that someone is out there trying to expose this type of builder!  Once again, I apologize for the vague term I used when saying ""Most"", it was not intended as a slight against anyone who does take pride in their work, but more for the general building developers who encourage this type of work ethic.  Unlike the homes our fathers and Uncles built many moons ago, a good portion of the homes being built today, will never stand the same test of time.  Ab"

292053,solopaddler,2009-01-14 02:26:00,8605," Exactly why, when we were in the market last year we didn't buy a home in a newer subdivision.  That and the tiny postage stamp sized lots, zero landscaping and zero privacy.  We bought a house that's 35 years old with everything upgraded and done (and I mean everything  ). 85X160' lot with mature landscaping and total privacy.  As far as Mike Holmes goes, I think he's cool."
292054,danc,2009-01-14 02:28:00,4677,"Where are the building inspectors in all of these cases? I work in construction and in my neck of the woods, you don't get away with any of this crap. When you buy your permit, you can expect inspections. And you better be sure that you are a ticketed tradesman or you're in big trouble. The Ministry of labor checks us for tickets. I know of cases when the drywall was out up before the insulation was inspected. Nope. Take all of the drywall off so the insulation can be inspected and passed. Perhaps this is the fault of shoddy construction practices in southern Ontario? Not enough enforcement? A friend of mine who is a builder had to rip the finished drywall off of a finished staircase because the handrail was 1/2"" lower than code. He had to replace the backing to raise the hand rail 1/2"".  You won't get away with any of this stuff here. Why aren't these houses inspected by competent inspectors as they are being built? And why are they being built by unqualified workers? I live and work in the same Province. You'd be in jail if you tried to pull this stunt in the north."
292055,rob v,2009-01-14 02:28:00,535,"Solopaddler - I Hope the renovations done to your home were done by qualified tradesmen !   : ))  And I think Dan C has a good point.  The market place peice recently done that included MH as the guest ""inspector"" did key in on that point also - it certainly looked like the inspectors involved in the cases in Hamilton weren't doing anywhere close to their job.  Wonder why ?   Pressure from the builders/city hall/contractors to get things passed so projects keep moving, permits keep getting issued and taxes/revenues keep coming in ?   Makes you wonder.       Inspectors are supposed to be there to ensure minimum code (which appears to be sub standard as it is according to MH) is met, things are done safely and shoddy work isn't tolerated... aren't they ?  Where are these guys ??   As a consumer I'd like to think the legislators that are paid with tax dollars are doing their jobs properly."
292066,pike slayer,2009-01-14 02:44:00,1177,"as for inspectors go i find alot of them young and dumb. they have never touched a hammer or 2by4 and they dont know anything. they are under qualified and they dont catch poor workmanship, if it looks like a nice neat job then it passes. i feel some of the older respected carpenters should go back to school and do the inspectors course and do that cause its not a reall physcially demanding job."
291761,tinbanger,2009-01-13 16:36:00,1028,"I would take issue with the 'all' builders are your enemy. do you homework , check previous subdivisions the buidler has bulit and see what pops up.  We bought an new entry level home from a medium sized builder in Barrie about 15 years ago. Only a couple of minor issues shortly after we moved in that were dealt with quickly. None of my neighbours had any major issues except a leaking foundation that the builder fixed .  have since bought another house in the same subdivision ( same builder and age) . No issues here except wear and tear .   Custom home builders have there issues as well.  TB"

291785,diggyj,2009-01-13 17:48:00,548,"I think Mike goes a bit overboard most of the time. Some of the jobs that he does can be done other ways, not by doing a crappy job but by doing a good job without going the extra mile.  He gets all his materials for free, so thats why he uses a few extra nails or a thicker layer of this or that on a house. I have a friend who is a contractor and has worked on a few jobs with him in the past and he tells me that he is an arrogant ass and that he has a huge chip on his shoulder and that his work is considered overkill.  Sure, seeing his show and seeing some of the crap that he has to redo is disgusting but he seems to make every effort to make his builds ""hurricane proof"".  If he was paying for stuff out of his own pocket it would be a different story.  All builders have problems and can be difficult to work with."
291790,pikehunter,2009-01-13 17:52:00,1659,"Holmes has done a lot of good by making a public statement on how much shoddy workmanship is going on. Some by builders, some by contractors and renovators, some by unlicensed people, some also by ""handymen."" One thing he seldom comments on is how some of these homeowners got stuck in these bad situations in the first place. And that is quite simply that there are a lot of tightwads out there that are only interested in getting the cheapest price.  People have to do their homework! Don't go cheap, don't buy cheap materials and quit looking for a bargain! You only get what you pay for, nothing is free. I encounter cheap people everyday at work and do my best to explain why something costs a few bucks more and generally succeed with getting the point across. Sometimes though I can't and just have to sell them the cheap stuff and let it go at that.  With that said, yes there are too many shoddy repairs and renos done everyday even when homeowners have paid a premium, that is why you have to do your homework.  And yes Holmes is arrogant  so is Curyak, do you ever listen how he talks down about his customers, every show of his I have seen (haven't seen him recently though) he talks about how unreasonable, clueless, unmovable or demanding the client is. It irritates me to listen to that, he should keep it to himself or keep it off camera."
