293035,Bernie,2009-01-16 04:36:00,3190, Thank you Dan.
293064,Big Cliff,2009-01-16 11:25:00,6899,"Well, since so many ""Mechanics"" want to know why there is so much water in the oil;  Well, in the course I just finished in failure analsys one of the questions on the test was ""how much water is produced from burning 1 gal of gas in a standard internal combustion engine.  The answer: Approx. 1 gal of water. (I got 100% on that test)  If the engine can't get up to operating temperature the water can not becarried away by the exhaust system. So, to all you ""mechanics"" who think there ""MUST"" be some leak somewhere, sorry but I'll side with Bernie on this one.  For those that want to figure it out for yourselves; here is the formula   2C8H18  +  25O2  =  16CO2  +  18H2O"
293065,Greencoachdog,2009-01-16 11:48:00,8163,Great thread Bernie!!!  I really liked the responses from those that just thought they were mechanics!!!
293068,outllaw,2009-01-16 12:07:00,1232,seen that myself bernie. water and short trips equate big bucks. some models are very bad. . with these temps this winter there will be more. thank you for the heads up.
293069,OhioFisherman,2009-01-16 12:08:00,6623,"Had a block heater on my first Astro van and the diesel trucks at work, nice to go out in the morning unplug the heater and have warm air right now from the heater.  A bit cool here this morning -12f coldest since 94, but no mosquitos.  Air has moisture in it and engines suck, if the combustion is not complete or like Bernie says the engine isn`t run long enough to burn off the moisture, or evaporate moisture left in the engine when it is shut off?  Never had a problem like that, 25 miles had been a short drive to work.  Engine bearing are pretty cheap, but a project to do on a lot of cars, every time I did them was on a bare block."
293081,danbouck,2009-01-16 12:38:00,4380,Very interesting! I gotta get my wife to let the truck warm up longer now that I've read this.
293166,POLLIWOGG,2009-01-16 16:06:00,835,"I had to rebuild the tranny in my car last year because it was ruined by water.  My bud had the drive shaft for the oil pump in his f150 break because the motor was full of water and it froze but he hadn't drove it since he changed the oil pan a couple months before. We figured he had a funnel for the oil and another one in the rad and got them mixed up, ooops . But now that I think about it ,it was parked in the woods and a  good candidate for condensation."
293201,douG,2009-01-16 17:20:00,2693,"Thanks for the lesson, Bernie, Cliff.  I is smarter now."
293207,BillM,2009-01-16 17:44:00,17367,"Guys, a great investment for the winter would be a Tempro ZeroStart coolant heater.  I use one on my TDI, and the glowplug light doesn't stay on for more then 2-3 seconds.  Alot better to warm the coolant, which then circulates *most* of the engine due to convection.  You can pick them up at Crappy Tire for around $50 or so."
293208,John,2009-01-16 17:49:00,2956,Thanks for the lesson guys. Now the problem is that I need to get Barbara out of bed much earlier in the morning so that she can go out and start the car while I am getting ready for work. I'll let you know how it goes..........
293211,misfish,2009-01-16 17:56:00,29133,"Well I did a check this AM,before even starting the ol girl up. The oil was a nice and clear,the cap had that milky residue. Now that, that was cool,I proceeded out for some bussiness and got friggen rear end today. By another ford. Thanks for the STEEL bumper ford. Poor buggers plastic front end was all shattered. Not his fault. The roads were pretty crap. We went on our way,as to save the inssurance crap. 150 bucks for a bumper at the scrap yard for me,a few hundred for the plastic on his.  But boy, the neck does hurt.  WTG ON THE 100% Cliff."
293213,irishfield,2009-01-16 17:58:00,26272,"Better remove that Brian before fishinautographs arrests you by PM for leaving the scene! lol  Bet that plastic front end costs over $1500  When I stopped that rampaging drunk in midland with my back bumper the repair for new bumper, bumper cover and install was $1663 !"
293224,misfish,2009-01-16 18:11:00,29133,"Never left the scene Wayne. Just got off the iciy hill before we got hit again. We both had winter fault insurance. LOL We exchanged info,but signed to take care of our own repairs. Yes there are many that would of taken the low road and went for the custo,but hey,crap happens. if it was a 2009 yeah,but hey,I was on my way to pay for the hall. The ol 97 150 is starting to look like a 97 now. Theres no bush or trail that will keep us away now. HAHAHAHA"
293265,ecmilley,2009-01-16 20:05:00,2163,"that's the most extreme case I have ever seen, sell your customers remote starters that should help somewhat"
293267,misfish,2009-01-16 20:09:00,29133, Wish they made one for a 5 speed truck. How would it start with no one to step on the clutch pedal to start?
293269,irishfield,2009-01-16 20:10:00,26272, Yah have to leave it in neutral and deal with a frozen emerg brake instead ! lol
293270,misfish,2009-01-16 20:13:00,29133, Dont even go there Wayne.   I have to park it in gear.
293271,ecmilley,2009-01-16 20:15:00,2163,"they do make them for manual shift, but for the same reason I don't have it on my car is no remote start is easier than replacing cables"
293274,misfish,2009-01-16 20:21:00,29133," It aint the cables,it the dang adjuster bar.They have to be removed and lubed.It,s just dang cold to get this done right now."
293276,ecmilley,2009-01-16 20:29:00,2163,can't say i blame you to darn cold to be working on vehicles outside
293277,Big Cliff,2009-01-16 20:32:00,6899,"I think John has the best solution!   Oh and John, if you want to get her out of bed earlier; just roll over and ask if she wants to fool around for a bit or does she have to get out there and start the car right away?"
293457,Markystang,2009-01-17 03:09:00,131,Like in hybrid vehicles. The engine only runs a few minutes at a time to charge the batteries.
293459,Bernie,2009-01-17 03:13:00,3190, Hmmmmm.... Good point!
293461,Clampet,2009-01-17 03:17:00,1947,"That makes sense, because when the vehicle is cold, there is a lot of white exhaust coming out of the tailpipe, but as you continue driving, and the engine gets ""up to temperature"", that white fog coming out of the tailpipe disappears. That must be the point where all the water and humidity has been burned off."
293604,Lowe Rider,2009-01-17 15:41:00,79,"Bernie, So as long as you drive more than these customers you should have no problem? The key is getting the engine up to operating temp and this will not happen. That is wild."
293020,irishfield,2009-01-16 04:02:00,26272, Not to support either arguement Bernie... BUT... the glycol will burn off in the engine and the water will be left behind... if it is a coolant leak somewhere. I know Glycol is VERY flameable as I lost an uncle to it's fumes exploding in a 45 gallon drum.
293021,Bernie,2009-01-16 04:04:00,3190, Doug. Humour me here. It is water. It is condensation or a byproduct of combustion. A very severe case. Both customers have identical driving habits. None of my other customers have this issue. I don't know of any others that have the same driving habits. There are no other reasons for water to be in there.
293022,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-16 04:04:00,0,"Quote""If this manufacturer had not discontinued their cold weather testing grounds in Northern Ontario this problem may have never surfaced Quote""   so it is a GM vehicle, I heard from a freind in kapuskasing that the GM cold weather testing was shutting down  I wonder if Toyota will shut down theirs in Timmins?"
293023,Bernie,2009-01-16 04:06:00,3190, There is no coolant loss in either vehicle. Pressure tests were done to verify and no fluid top ups have been necessary.
293026,gdelongchamp,2009-01-16 04:10:00,199,You have water mixed in with your oil. You probably have a cracked block.
293028,Bernie,2009-01-16 04:11:00,3190,Guys...I'm not a fly by night mechanic here. I know my stuff. Been at it all my life. Why just two vehicles that are driven the same way have the same issue? It's water.
293030,Grimace,2009-01-16 04:22:00,2020,Interesting stuff Bernie.
293032,irishfield,2009-01-16 04:31:00,26272,"Well if the coolant system is full, never topped and pressure checked... it can't be anything else Bernie!  ...unless they ticked off their neighbour and he poured a gallon of water in their oil fill hole.. lol"
293033,danc,2009-01-16 04:31:00,4677,Bernie is right here guys. I had the same issues with an 81 Ford that I drove about 3 minutes to work. There is no anti freeze mixing with oil here. Simply water with oil because of condensation. Happened every winter. Went away every spring.
