293126,Guidofisherman,2009-01-16 14:49:00,206,"I waited til the cold weather really hit and so we all could appreciate summer fishing for Nipigon brookies. Thanks to CMT, I finally figured out how to get the photos uploaded from Photobucket. I decided to break the post into two parts to reduce load time, but they all come from the 2008 season on the river. I'll post the lake photos later. This fall, I finally got Photoshop CS3 for processing and have been playing around with creative frames and 'actions' to simplify things. I know the photos are a little overdone, but it was just my way of learning the range of the program. I'll be going back to a ""simple presentation""  in the future.  Alan                  "

293160,Ramble,2009-01-16 15:55:00,713,Geat fish photos. You can never agru with a pile of brookie shots. There is some brutes for sure. Cant wait to see the rest.   YOU'RE TELLING ME! Not much worse then a butchered fish photo when its a memory.  -Dave
