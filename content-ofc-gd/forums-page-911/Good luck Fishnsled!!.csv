I got a messge from Will earlier this week, giving the the what for, for not inviting him up to Simcoe over Xmas... Then he realized that if he had a problem on the ice he would; a) be relying on us to get him back to shore for help, then he came to his senses, realizing that if the fish were biting, he may end up a cooked goose!!!!! Being a long standing member of this board, FnS would understand that the bite is on, well, the bite is on!!!! there wouldn't be any room for his carcass with the power auger on the sled! c) he's a little too big for perch bait!  Just ribbin yah bud! Talk soon! HH"

He's at home recovering comfortably.  Bad news:  I told him if we got any snow this weekend I'd be over to shovel it....with 15cm coming today and tonight, guess what I'll be doing in the morning?? LOL.  All worked out great...I'm sure he'll update himself when he's back online."
