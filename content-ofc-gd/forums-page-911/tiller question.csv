292985,irishfield,2009-01-16 02:56:00,26272,Pick up tube has fallen off... or if a flop tube is stuck against the side somewhere.  As for squeeze bulb not working.. my brand new one for my kicker had a defective check valve and never worked properly. Had to replace it this spring.
293014,waterwolf,2009-01-16 03:54:00,556,"so it's probably repairable then?    alright , good news but i think i'll wait 'til the thaw to have a look see.  thanks irish."
293017,sonny,2009-01-16 03:57:00,511,"yep definatly sounds like the pick up tube has a problem,,,"
293019,irishfield,2009-01-16 04:00:00,26272,Not sure how accessible the new tanks are. I have the little tank for my kicker in the shop... I'll have a look tomorrow.
293031,waterwolf,2009-01-16 04:31:00,556,"ok,, thanks . i'll watch for your info"
293505,irishfield,2009-01-17 04:55:00,26272,"Looks like mine is one piece and the top where the hose hooks onto snaps into the tank. From there it's a clear tube straight down with screen on bottom. Tank appears to need about 1.5"" of fuel to cover screen.  If yours is the same then the tube is cracked.. broken off or similar. Unscrew your cap and have a look with a flash light."
