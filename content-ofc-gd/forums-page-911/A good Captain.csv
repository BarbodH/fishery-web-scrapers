Sullenberger, a former fighter pilot, was the last off the plane, which become submerged as it floated past midtown Manhattan. Passengers said he matter-of-factly replied ""You're welcome"" to grateful passengers who thanked him for bringing the plane down safely. Only minor injuries were reported after the crash, which investigators believe was caused when a flock of geese collided with both engines, disabling them"

294115,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-01-18 17:37:00,0,The reports also said the pilot had experience in glider flying which no doubt helped in his experience to land that plane(glider) full of passengers safely. I hope hes the pilot on any plane Im flying on

Pretty sure he's a 2nd officer, but whatever, the skills of those guys to fly those monstrous planes has always amazed me, and to see how the crew landed that plane in New York with very few injuries was absolutely outstanding.  I think that crew exemplified what skill and experience is all about and they deserve all the accolades that are coming their way !!"
