For the test I very scientifically lightly flicked my reel pre pit stop and came up with a spinning time of 2:10. Not bad, but I knew it could do better... little did I know!  After a ten minute procedure and a regrease with my favourite bike oil (SUPER light, and its a dry type oil) I lightly flicked it again...actually seemed a little less hard than the first time and got a spin time of...  SIX AND A HALF MINUTES  Now, I'm not one to brag about my gear...nor do I care what anyone else rocks, because I say get out there and fish what you got so this post is simply a heads up for people to take the ten minutes and do a little work that will greatly improve the performance of your reel for FREE.  unbelieveable, thanks Solo and Drifter and any others that have mentioned this tip   Its GOTTA be bedtime now..."

293537,forrest,2009-01-17 09:17:00,1032,Is this spinning being done while it is full of line?  forrest
293545,okumasheffield,2009-01-17 11:55:00,318,"Kemper, it seems to great minds (fishermen) think the same!  I did exactly what Solo suggested a week ago (didnt want to buy a whole tank of degreasing solution, had to wait for my coworker to bring me some) and WA-LA!  my Sheffield now spins forever ... just kidding. It spins significantly longer than it did before wonder if it has anything to do with lubes I have used or whatever but I am just too happy to think about it  the problem is that ... when can I get sew oil? I really dont want to keep using what I have been using ..  Lets just go out to spin our centerpin and forget about hooking onto fish, what do you say? Kemper  BTW, I think this never-ending-cold-snap has bored us ..."

293624,MJL,2009-01-17 16:12:00,2427, You could also try using a light gun oil to lube the bearings if you have sewing machine oil.
293628,tibbs,2009-01-17 16:16:00,650,Nice!  How did you degrease the bearings?
