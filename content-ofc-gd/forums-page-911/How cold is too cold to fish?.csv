294149,4thgen,2009-01-18 19:00:00,157,"I went out once when it was -35*C and -47*C with the wind, without a hut. It wasn't something that I will do again. You could literally sit at the hole and keep scooping out the ice without getting anywhere. The 3lb herring I caught that day froze solid in about two minutes. None of my reels worked right either."
294175,bbog,2009-01-18 20:31:00,665,"Time to pack it in when the fish are ""flash freezing"". Other than that I'm good to go!"
293194,lookinforwalleye,2009-01-16 16:59:00,4399,All you guys that ice fish in the minus 20 to 40 range are nuts and I mean that with the utmost respect!LOL Anything colder than minus 10 and I am staying indoors.
293238,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-16 18:49:00,10439, If I waited for it to get above -20 to go out I wouldn't see the lake between November and March!!!! I'm getting out this weekend for the first time because we have had below average temps for the last 8 weeks!!! During that time the average daytime high has been in the -30 range. This Sunday we are supposed to hit +1!!!! Going camping this weekend!!!!  There ain't no Nookie like a Chinookie!!!!!!
293263,packrat,2009-01-16 20:00:00,93,here I was thinking I'm such a wuss for picking my days to get some fishing time in----after reading some of the replies find out I'm in good company here(no offence)

294012,Big Cliff,2009-01-18 11:20:00,6899,"When I was younger and lived in French River and Elliott Lake, we didn't care how cold it was, I can remember many ice fishing trips where we would build a fire on shore so we could warm up between catching fish. Mind you we were often fishing within 100' or so of the shore and most of the areas were somewhat sheltered from the wind. Very different from fishing down here.  Now, I guess because of my age, I find I have to kind of pick and choose, -10 with no wind and the sun shining = a good day for me, -10 and no sun; I would probably want a hut or some place to warm up."
294032,Moosebunk,2009-01-18 14:04:00,3970,"I'd go fishing in some pretty cold crap if I was garaunteed fish. lol.  -283 C.  Absolute zero.......... we'll all NOT be fishing there one day as this universe as we know it has long since stopped expanding from the big bang from whence it came.  We're all being sucked back into an origin of nothingness now..... the hole where there's simply nothing, therefor nothing moves, therefor no energy lives, therefor no heat or fish or anything exist.  Kinda like Attawapiskat where I used to live and fish at -283 C."
