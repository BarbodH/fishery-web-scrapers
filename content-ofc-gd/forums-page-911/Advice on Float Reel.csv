293289,hotrod,2009-01-16 21:06:00,103,I've got a leeds I bought 25 years ago when I was a young pup that I still use.
293298,Twocoda,2009-01-16 21:46:00,4130,i just retired my StreamRunner last year served me 15 years .....picked up a Sheffield at a moderate price 250ish...honestly i dont have ANY complaints works great in cold and start up is instant...the only reason i retired the StreamRunner was this particular reel had a leather crest on the backside of it and it was beginning to peel off from years of weathering ...great unit though ...  The price of the reel does NOT make a fisherman !!!!....although so many Boe Boes seem to think so ...i would suggest you borrow or buy moderate to see if you even like the technique ( it isnt for everyone) but once you have mastered pins youll love it !!!  Good luck on your choice  i wish i had a video for every new fishermans first hook up on a pin....can be some pretty funny footage...
293352,eyeforelle,2009-01-16 23:49:00,38,"Islander hands down is the best bang for your buck. Built like a rock and spins as smooth as silk. It was my first float reel and I still use it steady to this day. The Raven SST3 is another option. Very smooth and light like a feather. Only problem though is that I don’t see it being very sturdy. Bass Pro carries the Raven SST3 for $279.99, which is a very reasonable price for that reel. An Islander is going to run you anywhere between $300-$350, but they are well worth the money. Hope this helps."
293393,kemper,2009-01-17 01:43:00,2232,"  bought it new, but was buying a whole ton of other stuff at the time so I got a break on the price"
292725,FLEX ROD,2009-01-15 18:59:00,394,"Okay foalks, all the recent posts regarding Float Reels has made me want to go out and buy one, now the question is what to buy. I want to buy a good reel as I know that a good reel makes a heck of a difference and a good reel last my go to reels are 30 plus years old and I have had them since new. So I want a good reel but not sure what I should be looking at spending, do I go Raven do I go Islander if so what should I be expecting to pay for it?  Help please,  Thanks - FLEX - John"
292735,super dave,2009-01-15 19:35:00,323,"Lots of good makes and models out there.  Probably one of the most popular is the Islander.  I own and use one.  Canadian made, light and super tough with really tight tolerance.  Try checking out www.floatfishing.net.  lot of guys dumping used equipment."
292737,BillM,2009-01-15 19:37:00,17367,"For a less expensive reel, I love my Streamside..  As long as you keep up with the maintenance, it should last you forever.  Not to many moving parts to mess up"
292745,kemper,2009-01-15 19:56:00,2232,"Depends what you are looking for.  Islanders are prooven, and workhorse reels.  Personally I went with the Raven SST 3 for my new wheel, after using the cheap raven matrix for over a year and having nothing but great things to say about it. Some would tell you to stay away from raven stuff, others (like me) swear by it for reasonable prices and great products.  Morale of the story, you dont need to go out and blow 800 bucks on a reel to have a solid reel that will last you a long time"
292775,FLEX ROD,2009-01-15 21:05:00,394,"Thanks for the feed back, okay let me be more specific, is the Raven and the Islander like 50 dollars difference in cost? The Raven around 300 and the Islander about 350? If this is a case which one would be the one to look at? I do not plan on spending any more than I have to to get a good reel that will last me.  Billm when you say keep up with the maintenance on the Streamside what exactly are you refereing to?  Thanks guys,  FLEX - John"
292840,kemper,2009-01-15 22:56:00,2232,"  The raven will run you something like 309 and the islander more like 350 or so. Both can be had for cheaper used  I looked at both and chose the Raven, its much lighter and had a better start up than the islander...that said the islander did seem to have a certain quality of finish the raven lacked, but imo the raven was the better buy for the water that I fish.  You might pick them both up and buy the islander, its all personal preference"
292845,pirlo06,2009-01-15 23:11:00,17,"im on my third reel and I settled down with the Islander steelheader, best reel!! 4 to 5 hundred. dont let the price tag discourage you because if you end up settling for something cheaper then you will always wish you had that other reel."
292849,danbo,2009-01-15 23:23:00,2646,Buy used like has been mentioned already. What rod you buy determines what reel to get for balance. Join the Floatboard for details..
292879,MJL,2009-01-16 00:06:00,2427,"Islander has my vote as a bullet proof reel to last.  A solid, well made reel that’s easy to maintain. I’ve taken spills with it and dropped it but my Islander keeps on ticking.  There’s always a few used ones floating around somewhere usually for $200-$300 (or less) and they’re usually in great condition.  A few years ago, some places use to retail them for $300-$325 brand new.  I think the ones with the bearing upgrades are around $100 more (at least the one’s I’ve seen for sale).  Great customer service too, my friend lost his reel pouch for a fly reel and they sent him one for free."
292884,Victor,2009-01-16 00:13:00,1609,"i just started getting into float reels and my gf got me an okuma Aventa ... haven't used it yet so i can't tell you about it ...  just a heads up though, if you do end up deciding to get the raven SST3, i see a new one on ebay right now for $270 US ... too bad the canadian dollar is so weak at the moment"
292889,danbo,2009-01-16 00:24:00,2646,GLoomis is built like a tank. For big guys only.  http://www.centerpinangling.com/centerpinreels.html
293142,BillM,2009-01-16 15:26:00,17367," John,  I take it apart after a day of fishing, clean out the gunk and give the bearings a drop or two of 3in1 oil...  Maybe I am over doing it, who knows"
293153,highdrifter,2009-01-16 15:46:00,2534," I'm probably a little off key here, as I don't own a float reel, but 3 in 1??  Doesn't this oil contain a solvent? Wouldn't a true bearring oil work better?  just wondering...  Thanks Bill HD"
293162,FLEX ROD,2009-01-16 16:00:00,394,"Once again guys thanks for the input.  Kemper, the Raven that you buy did you buy new or used?   FLEX- John"
293167,BillM,2009-01-16 16:07:00,17367," It could, if so I'll start using something else"
293175,highdrifter,2009-01-16 16:16:00,2534, May I suggest Abec 9 super oil?!!
293176,River Rat,2009-01-16 16:18:00,161,"do not use 3 in 1 oil if you plan on fishing in the cold. Sewing machine oil works good.  what ever oil you plan to use, put it in the freezer over night. If it still flows well after being in the deep freeze for 12 hours, use it. If it gets solid or fairly close, it will bind your reel in the cold temps.  RR"
293178,BillM,2009-01-16 16:21:00,17367,"  Thanks dude, I appreciate the advice.  The last thing I'd want to do is bugger up the bearings on the reel I just picked up"
293182,highdrifter,2009-01-16 16:28:00,2534,"Ya mang, it's as slick as whale s**t on an ice flow...  "
293189,KelfuN,2009-01-16 16:44:00,246,"this is what i was told/personal experience...  i started off with a sheffield, and still using it until today..it spins nice and the start up speed is moderate. but after playing with my friends purist II, i realized my pin is not up to par in terms of smoothness and startup speed.  in conclusion, its always good to start with a decent ($200-300)reel, then work your way up to a better one..you WILL appreciate your pin more!   some of you may disagree, just my 0.02"
293259,canadian_copper,2009-01-16 19:57:00,925,hands down the islander!!!! flawless!!!
293262,centerpin_drift,2009-01-16 20:00:00,94,"i use a matte black stanton, best reel ive ever used, fits my hand like a glove.  The only other reel i like other then my stanton is the J.W Young purist II. built like a tank and its made to last.  the stanton and purist were bought on the same day 15 years ago and they have floated every season since, not alot of people use j.w but defintally something to check out. Cant complain with the islander and streamside, both great reels, and i know guys who have had them for years without any problems. http://www.jwyoungs.co.uk/reels.htm"
293275,centerpin_drift,2009-01-16 20:23:00,94,"looks like stanton improved their original model last year, check it out http://www.adcockstanton.com/index.htm"
293279,floatman_mike,2009-01-16 20:51:00,14,what do you guys think of the spahr 1212?
293286,canadian_copper,2009-01-16 21:01:00,925,CANT COMMENT ON THAT BRO. NEVER EVEN SEEN ONE IN PERSON YET  LOL
