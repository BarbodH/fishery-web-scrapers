293240,Beats,2009-01-16 18:51:00,543,  That's quite a deal if you happen to want to fish right where he is standing.  How much to get him to follow you around for the day?
293249,bassjnkie,2009-01-16 19:32:00,1101,"  I remember hearing years ago. He sits out there in his lawn chair, with the gas auger by his side. And actually drills you a hole, (apparently), anywhere for a dollar. Guess he's not doing it anymore."
293252,Clampet,2009-01-16 19:42:00,1947,Get a good grip.. http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=kAbaM5kz9I4
293260,buckster,2009-01-16 19:59:00,530,Augers are tricky a few bumps of the blades and they are toast....  I usully drill all the holes unless im fishing with someone who i trust knows how to use it.  Id sooner ask someone if they can drill me a hole rather than ask to use his/her auger.    Do yourself a favor be it used or brand new pick one up and enjoy. Fishing isn't fun without the proper tools!
293476,Rich,2009-01-17 03:58:00,3927,Dude they are cheap and with proper care will last you forever. After the initial 40 - 50 - 60 bucks you just gotta buy new blades once in a while for $20. The blades last me a season and I drill quite a few holes.
293533,BassAsin,2009-01-17 07:43:00,806,hahahah thanks RR  i wuz juiced pointin oot tha fack thatt TJ wuz try-N two brung two atention!  MatT!
293555,BUSTER,2009-01-17 13:19:00,1336,"KIJIJI,  i found one for 10 bucks , or i was thinking the same as ted  ..chainsaw!! http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-to...QQAdIdZ96373431"
292771,profisher25,2009-01-15 20:58:00,185,"Heres the thing, I am planning on going ice fishing very soon, i would say within the next 2 weeks, i don't have an auger, and i cant borrow my grandfathers axe, cause i don't think i will be seeing him any time soon!  Do I have any other, and possibly easier options?  Any help / recommendations would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advanced!"
292778,BassAsin,2009-01-15 21:08:00,806,"call around at home hardware, canadian tire, wal mart or any other hardware store they have chisel's for sale for as low as 20 bux  takes a couple minutes to get through 16 inches of ice but start your hole as about a 6 inch and it will end at about and 8 always give yourself a couple extra inches and as for an axe the top of your hole has to be about 2 feet to get a 6 inch hole at the bottom and you WILL get wet its a guarantee."
292780,tinbanger,2009-01-15 21:13:00,1028,"short of the obvious ( buying an auger or spud bar!) and presumeing you aren;t going with some one who has one . Your options are somewhat limited.  If you are going to a busy area ( ie Cooks bay) and on a busy day ( weekend) and the weather isn't so freakin cold you could hope to find some open ( not froze shut) holes.  Or try and see if a freindly fellow fisherperson on the ice would let you borrow thiers  last two are kinda risky  Or try hooking up with a fellow OFNr , you got two weeks to plan it.  TB"
292791,GBW,2009-01-15 21:33:00,8460,I would try the hook-up's section and plz change your sig as it's HUGE!  it takes a while to load even with RHSI
292792,cityfisher,2009-01-15 21:42:00,959,just go buy a 40$ 6 inch auger.. done.. or find a buddy and tag along
292795,figureight,2009-01-15 21:43:00,40,heres a solution to your problem.... buy an auger
292812,pike slayer,2009-01-15 22:19:00,1177,build a big hot fire on the ice!
292833,joonmoon,2009-01-15 22:48:00,528,Look in hook-ups and I can make your day fun and enjoyable if ya wanna drive a bit.
292834,Beats,2009-01-15 22:48:00,543,"Up until recently I did not have my own auger and always had to fish with someone who did have one.  I did have a spud bar but you certainly don't want to be beating your way through the ice if you aren't certain it's fairly thick.  You may be asking for trouble if you are standing on thin ice as you bash a hole through it.  It's true, that if you go to Cook's bay or anywhere really popular, you should be able to scavenge some hold from ppl as they abandon them.  At worst you will need to break the thin layer of ice that forms on top.  You really do need to just get an auger or borrow one from someone who isn't using theirs.  Or better yet, find someone to go along with you.. as long as they bring their auger."
292843,drwxr,2009-01-15 22:59:00,453,"depending where you want to go fishing, sooner or later you will need the auger. but if you plan to fish for perch, cooks bay is like swiss cheese, just pick a hole."

292881,pike slayer,2009-01-16 00:08:00,1177,look in a local classifieds. i've seen them here for sale for $15.

292963,Beans,2009-01-16 02:03:00,3339,"When I was a kid, all we used was a hatchet...With all the sub-zero temps of late that might be a chore chopping a new hole but it would come in handy to open up a fairly new abandoned hole...  One trip we forgot the auger at home and had a hut operator cut us a couple of holes for $5..."

293049,profisher25,2009-01-16 05:23:00,185,"  ""Learn to Live"".. to be honest, i came up with it a while ago, just popped up in my head... what does it mean?... well.. Learn to live.. live the life of adventure, go places, do stuff... us anglers all have one thing in common.. fishing.. we all love it!  and to us.. fishing is a part of our life.. or at least to the most devoted anglers out there!   Us anglers learn to live, and we live to fish! .. if that doesn't make any sense, then i have no idea what will, lol"
293052,profisher25,2009-01-16 05:36:00,185," I made my sig a bit smaller, hope it reduces the lag"

293057,Photoz,2009-01-16 09:55:00,792,"The LAST time (and I do mean THE LAST TIME) I loaned my auger, about 10 minutes later the guy brings it back over . . .     ""Gee . . .    this thing just doesn't seem to cut into the ice . . . .    ?"" He was right . . .     gollee e e e e . . . .    I guess I musta wore it out cutting about 6 holes a half hour before? Lesson learned . ...     if ya wanna fish, don't expect others to finance your excursion, eh? Get the proper equipment . . . .    then go fishing? About $60.00 will get you a decent auger!"
293141,Zubris21,2009-01-16 15:26:00,563,"I agree, I would have a hard time loaning out my auger.  Heck I would even have a hard time  asking to borrow one from another group.  I say bite the bullet and spend the $60 for a brand new one at CT.  Its an investment that will last you as long as you want provided you take care of it.  Oil it down when not in use for a while and change the blades every few years (depending on usage) and your set.  Student or not, don't be cheap.  I was in the same boat a couple years ago, and I could always justify fishing purchases, because they were ""long term"" investments, and it would inevitably save me money at the grocery store, provided you like to eat fish."
293147,Sinker,2009-01-16 15:36:00,8692,"I'd never loan you my auger, but I'd drill you a couple holes if you asked me nicely out on the ice.  I don't loan my auger to anyone but people I know, know how to use it.  If you want to ice fish, the first thing you need is a hole in the ice. So, you need an auger!!!  Sinker"
293165,bassjnkie,2009-01-16 16:05:00,1101,Is the older gentlemen that cuts each hole for a dollar still on Simcoe?
