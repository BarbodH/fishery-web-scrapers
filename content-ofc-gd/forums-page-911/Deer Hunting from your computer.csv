293145,jwl,2009-01-16 15:31:00,1056,"I have a funny PC game..Deer Hunter's Revenge...the deer hunts the people  The deer looks for signs of hunters...girly mags,empty beer cans,toilet paper ect....and when you use the calls it says stuff like..""hey,who left the lights on in thier pick up?"" or a girls voice says ""hi boys, I am naked,and I brought pizza""..and "" viagra...get yer viagra"" ..when you finally lure out a hunter...the deer locks and loads it up and says stuff like..""let's rock and roll"""
293206,irishfield,2009-01-16 17:43:00,26272,I don't see anywhere in the game that you can stack your kill up like cordwood...

I'll never make it back to the shop now... reload ..fire.. reload.. fire !! lol  Got that picture via an MNR fella this morning. Someone's land lease was expiring in the USA apparently. This was the tag line for it.  ""After over 25 years of Quality Deer Management, they found out that they were losing their lease. There was only one thing to do ......"""
293280,bukee,2009-01-16 20:54:00,58,"My best on that game is 24,550.  The trick with that game is trying to shoot more than one deer with each shot, that gives you bonus points."
293351,Sinker,2009-01-16 23:49:00,8692,"Yep, to get the good scores, you gotta take the hardest shots. Wait for them, they'll come. The fast moving far deer are good, but 2 in one shot are great!  Sinker"
