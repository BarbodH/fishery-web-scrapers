293210,GNODDY,2009-01-16 17:54:00,163,"Hi Guys,  I have tried all over the Durham Region CTC, TSC and various other spots looking for a 5Lb Propane tank for my Ice Heater. Does anyone know where I can get one.  G"
293212,irishfield,2009-01-16 17:56:00,26272,I've tried to Geoff.. I'm hauling my 20 for now it appears.
293214,johnnyb,2009-01-16 17:58:00,3413,I may have a line on one...hang tight...
293215,GNODDY,2009-01-16 17:59:00,163,I've even tried the direct distributors of Propane and the cyclinders and they don't seem to know where to get them either.
293220,GNODDY,2009-01-16 18:05:00,163,Wayne didyou want to play rock paper scissors for it if JohnnyB can get one LOL
293222,jwl,2009-01-16 18:07:00,1056,I heard somewhere that they don't make those little ones any more for some reason
293223,irishfield,2009-01-16 18:10:00,26272,  I'm in no rush Geoff... I've got the cutter to pull mine in (when I put it's sides on it ..lol) ...it doesn't have to fit in the folded down hut.
293225,misfish,2009-01-16 18:16:00,29133,
293229,irishfield,2009-01-16 18:37:00,26272,Home Hardware shows them in their online catalogue. They have 5 and 8 lbrs in two different valve models shown. Approx $45 and $60 each.  Also if you find the right CTC store they have them... they just don't list them on their website for some reason!
293230,johnnyb,2009-01-16 18:39:00,3413,"I'm trying to get a hold of the guy I know who has one...if it drags on, I'll just pm you GNODDY...and maybe you too, Wayne....MAYbe..."
293232,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-16 18:40:00,10439,Try the forgotten hardware guy's.  Home Hardware
293235,irishfield,2009-01-16 18:43:00,26272,Issue like all tanks if used is age. 10 years.. throw it away. Nobody seems to do retail revalving anymore. Superior used to do it on #11 as you entered Barrie back in the day...  These trade a tanks are just getting a splash of terribly done paint and back on the shelf. I found one older than the outdated tank I was trading in last year and the tanks have no retest date stamped on them either.
293236,fishforfun,2009-01-16 18:44:00,105,"I have 2 on the sail boat, the big tanks are a bit much to hang off a rail. Bought both at Home hardware in Wiarton. Perhaps give your Home hardware a call to see if they can get you one."
293237,misfish,2009-01-16 18:45:00,29133,"I remember those guys. Now it,s a auto max dealership.lol"
293239,misfish,2009-01-16 18:50:00,29133,"I just called the local HH. They can get them for you,so I would think anyone of them can too."
293242,GNODDY,2009-01-16 18:56:00,163,Yup the local HH has them. $44.99 each wow that's pretty steep considering you can get a 20 for half that if you exchange one.  G
293243,misfish,2009-01-16 19:07:00,29133,"Ya see,size does matter.LOL"
293244,fishforfun,2009-01-16 19:14:00,105, Wait till you fill one I've paid $12 plus tax!
293246,misfish,2009-01-16 19:22:00,29133,Supply and demand.
293247,johnnyb,2009-01-16 19:29:00,3413,"GNODDY, you have a pm..."
293261,irishfield,2009-01-16 19:59:00,26272," Just remember to tell the young lad at the filling station it needs to be purged first.. then filled !  I think Lloyd and Ron only paid $5 to fill theirs last year in Temagami and the owner even drove in from home to do it! Not sure what to do this year... station is now self serve.. don't think they're filling anymore propane. ""Trade a tank"" only."
293324,solopaddler,2009-01-16 22:39:00,8605,I bought an 8lb'er from Canadian Tire in Dundas last fall. At that time they had tons of them...
293330,sonny,2009-01-16 22:56:00,511,i have seen them at my local homehardware store a week ago!
293363,Ron,2009-01-17 00:22:00,1683,Don't worry about the dang propane tank Geoff. Get yer arse to Cobourg so we can open the MCI account!
293392,Chuck Best,2009-01-17 01:43:00,308,"I've got an older one that I've been re-filling myself since the kid at the station said it was out of date......never any probs,just fill it from the 20lber......got to have the little dooey though.....TJ knows what I mean,(after he saw mine,he ordered 2...lol),Loves to fish Simcoe had 3 left today and they are called.....MacCoupler,got gas......they work great,it's just illegal to move the tank after it's been re-filled.....lol.....So come catch me.......lol......TC and tight lines all.....Chuck....."
