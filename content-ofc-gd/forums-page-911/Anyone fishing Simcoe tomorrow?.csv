293855,Greencoachdog,2009-01-18 01:48:00,8163, Go for the Perch eh!!!
293857,Joey,2009-01-18 01:50:00,9122,I'm good with Innisfil.  Are you on foot?  What does your hut look like etc. so we can find you.  Can you wear a big chicken head or something  Joey
293861,e-z-out,2009-01-18 01:56:00,1052,Innisfil is good as well I'll be there for 6am in that case
293862,MuskyBill,2009-01-18 01:58:00,311,"Done deal, I'll see y'all ('cept Glen!) in Innisfil. I'll try to be there for 6:00, but I'm thinking 6:30 is more realistic for me...  Gonna go get a head start on the shovelling now...."
293864,misfish,2009-01-18 02:00:00,29133,"If the ice is that good J.Head to lockhart road. Park and sled to the shoal. Or you can head to Fox. It will be the island to yer right when heading out. And yes,you can catch perch there too.LOL"
293865,Joey,2009-01-18 02:02:00,9122,"Awesome, see y'all tomorrow then.  Thanks for the tips Misfish and Walleyemaster, muchly appreciated.  Joey"
293866,Greencoachdog,2009-01-18 02:09:00,8163," Don't listen to this guy, he's a ""hunter"".. his tips are only good if you're going to shoot your fish!  Grab a rod and reel and show them how it's done tomorrow Brian....  .. unless of course yer chicken!  Bwauk Bwauk Bwauk!!!    Good luck to the rest of y'all... Paul and Joey, Bill, and Jose!!!  Y'all don't forget the camera's now.. ya heah?"
293870,MuskyBill,2009-01-18 02:13:00,311,Look for...  
293871,MuskyBill,2009-01-18 02:15:00,311,"Yeah, I'm not even sure where Brian's talking about...I park, then walk out about 300' & start cutting holes. No science here..."
293899,Shelley Cooper,2009-01-18 02:56:00,394,"Hey Joey.. wish I could help you a little more, but I have been working and haven't been out myself... Chuck is out there today, scouting the last place/spot we fished at last year... maybe he'll have some news by morning.. accessible from Innisfil...  give him a shout"
293909,e-z-out,2009-01-18 03:07:00,1052,ok Bill and Joey i'll keep my eye open for you i'll be in a Clam 5600 But now adays everyone has a Clam going to get the OFC Logo stictched on it with my screen name soon i'll be out 500' to 1000' cutting holes and checking with my aqua-vu for life.
293910,Clampet,2009-01-18 03:09:00,1947,Is it permissible to look up the lake Simcoe Board..  or  is that grounds fer dismissal?
293795,Joey,2009-01-17 23:56:00,9122,Anyone heading out tomorrow for some action on Simcoe?  Where ya heading?  Joey
293796,Greencoachdog,2009-01-17 23:58:00,8163,"No safe laker or whitey spots yet gal!... go fer Perch!!!   ... your team needs a nice Perch!   Yup!... and nice 6 or 7"" Perch, to post on the entry board... if we ever get an entry board that is..."
293804,e-z-out,2009-01-18 00:33:00,1052,I want to get out tomorrow morning for about 6am and be off the ice at 11am but where to go? Been all over and it's been slow for me and some of the guys off here. Now where to go for a few hours?
293806,irishfield,2009-01-18 00:35:00,26272,No Joey... but if you and Paul wanna head another hour North... Terry/Krawler and I are headed out on GBay...8am in my yard.
293808,Terry,2009-01-18 00:38:00,14456,there you go
293809,ciceri,2009-01-18 00:39:00,535," penetang, midland??  do you think theres more huts on penetang bay this year??"
293810,motv8tr,2009-01-18 00:42:00,2587,"I think there are more huts out on Penetang Bay this year, or at least it looks like it to me  Too bad I have to work.....  Maureen"
293811,irishfield,2009-01-18 00:43:00,26272, Looks like the usual zoo and we'll be no where near it. Headin for deep water... we hope. Gonna be a sled... stop... walk... drill.. stop walk drill...
293813,Greencoachdog,2009-01-18 00:50:00,8163,"Don't listen to those others gal.. go for Perch!  Remember what happened when you were Perch fishin' last year?  .. you caught that Hugh Jass Carp!!!  What's it gonna be this year?... another Hugh Jass Carp?  ... or maybe a Hugh Jass Poike!!!     ... I'm tellin' ya, go for Perch!  "
293819,Joey,2009-01-18 01:04:00,9122,"Thanks for the offer Wayne, but we will probably be doing alot of driving next weekend so we just wanted to stay close this weekend  Think we'll just hit up Simcoe somewhere, maybe go for some perch, what do you think GCD?  Thanks  Joey"
293822,MuskyBill,2009-01-18 01:08:00,311,"I think I'll be heading out early, just like Aile Goby, on/off early.  I was thinking of giving Innisfil a go. Perch in 20', or Lakers/Whiteys out past BigChevy's hut....  I'd heard through some guys at work (non-fisherfolk) that the huts are out further north of Innisfil, so I'm thinking Innisfil will be fine...unless someone else tells me otherwise, & then I'll be heading out of Gilford."
293823,Greencoachdog,2009-01-18 01:08:00,8163, I think that's a dang good idea!!!   .. or you could PM Sinker...
293828,e-z-out,2009-01-18 01:18:00,1052,Hey bill what time are you heading out?
293829,MuskyBill,2009-01-18 01:22:00,311,"I haven't fully decided, as it looks as if I'll be shovelling snow first thing.  I'm aiming to leave the house at 5, leaving the driveway for 5:30, hoping to be at Major Mack/400 Timmies for 6:15. What about you, & where will you be buying minnows?"
293832,e-z-out,2009-01-18 01:27:00,1052,I'm thinking 6am and picking up minnows at the same place
293837,Joey,2009-01-18 01:30:00,9122,So you two heading to Innisfil or Gilford then?  Joey
293838,MuskyBill,2009-01-18 01:31:00,311,"Where are you fishin'?  Wanna give Innisfil a try, or go for the sure thing with the Gilford Perchies. Since I'm also planning on hitting the highway for 11:00-noon, I'm ok with the Perch. I haven't been on the ice yet this year, so I'm more than happy to keep the Perch busy."
293840,walleyemaster,2009-01-18 01:32:00,325,hey guys..i was on simcoe today fished off snake island fox island and fox shoal..lots of ice out there traveled from gilford all the way up to fox shoal with my sled about 10 miles up the lake...  ice  was at least 10-12 inches everywhere there were trucks out on the fox shoal found tons of fish.. caught 2 whitefish 3 lakers and caught a million perch at 80-85 feet of water..cant stand it when the perch hit my line ...have fun there is lots of ice out there..
293843,buckster,2009-01-18 01:34:00,530,The lakes seems ok all over........ jacksons point has plenty of ice.  even way out there.   Huts sleds and quads all over.  Gonna head out for jp in the am......... or maybe innisfill
293848,MuskyBill,2009-01-18 01:41:00,311,"I'm a 'walker' so that's why I like Innisfil or Gilford. Great water, not far from shore...."
293849,e-z-out,2009-01-18 01:43:00,1052,Gilford for some perching sounds good to me bill and joey
293850,misfish,2009-01-18 01:44:00,29133,Nix my pm J.Seems theres enough ice everywhere .LM AO Stay safe you and Paul.
293851,Joey,2009-01-18 01:44:00,9122,Well Innisfil seems like the logical spot then.  Perch and/or Lakers and whites if we go far enough out.  Whaddya think?  Joey
293852,Joey,2009-01-18 01:45:00,9122," Hey, options are always good B  Now decisions, decisions  Joey"
293853,MuskyBill,2009-01-18 01:47:00,311,"Innisfil could also be used as a scouting mission, since that's where the Tyler Tourney is in just a few weeks.  No matter to me, as long as I'm fishin'.  In my limited ice experience, I've caught bigger Perch in Innisfil...PLUS, better parking there too.  Whaddya think, folks?"
