292842,Dano,2009-01-15 22:59:00,719,Who in Barrow Alaska besides this guy locks their doors?  A game of tag...
292856,darsky,2009-01-15 23:34:00,586,very frightening!!!
292870,johnnyb,2009-01-15 23:56:00,3413,"holy smokes!  That would be terrifying...I wonder why the photographer didn't try to run interference though.  If they were in a vehicle, could they not have driven over?  I mean, if they were just standing out in the open, I think they'd be too busy ensuring their own survival to take pics!"
292898,irishfield,2009-01-16 00:40:00,26272,a good camera man never leaves his post !!!
292906,iceslayer,2009-01-16 00:55:00,97,That bear would'nt have touched me.....  C'ause he would'nt have liked the smell in my pants........
292945,nancur373,2009-01-16 01:43:00,1211,Two movements: 1 Bowel movement. 2 Physical movement  Crap and Run   Curt
292973,Rizzo,2009-01-16 02:44:00,4754,zoinks! Some tense moments for that guy (although the camera man doesn't seem too concerned). Not too sure about the claim of 100's of deep scratches on the man's head and back though. I'm thinking if the bear got close enough to  issue 100's of scratches that man would be bear poop by now.
293044,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2009-01-16 05:07:00,160,  hmm I am not sure about how the artical states that PolarBears actively hunts humans... does it? regardless I felt for the guy..
293062,Dano,2009-01-16 10:50:00,719, The photographer is probably his ex wife sitting in her warm truck with all doors locked....
293085,corvette1,2009-01-16 13:00:00,1765,time to change my pants
293088,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-16 13:08:00,1362,  lol   ....that's exactly what I was thinking Wayne!!
293111,Leecher,2009-01-16 14:15:00,7832,Yikes!!     He probably wish he had a remote door opener installed on his vehicle
293127,Zubris21,2009-01-16 14:52:00,563,Wow that would be terrifying.  I need to make a trip up north to see some of these magnificent beasts before they are all gone.
293184,fishindevil,2009-01-16 16:32:00,6254,"WOW...thats incredible,talk about running for your life !!!!.  ..he is one lucky guy thats for sure.... thanks for sharing"
293196,lookinforwalleye,2009-01-16 17:09:00,4399,Happens all the time on Simcoe only it`s the ice fishermen chasing the Hooter`s girls around the ice hut!
293199,douG,2009-01-16 17:14:00,2693,Does joey still have that lovely picture of Melody?
293203,ricoboxing,2009-01-16 17:29:00,398,but that cute little bear probably just wanted to play   P3TA
293205,ch312,2009-01-16 17:43:00,1590,"dont enter someones sandbox unless you are prepared for the worst...especially when the guy that owns that sandbox will eat you  id feel little sympathy for the photographer if the bear caught him. the unfortunate part is the bear would likely be destroyed for being a ""savage human killer"" when it was just defending its territory."
293233,johnnyb,2009-01-16 18:41:00,3413,Oh man -- how do I embed a video?!  I have a beautiful post that will go along with this nicely...
293245,johnnyb,2009-01-16 19:14:00,3413,Okay...we'll try this...  Polar Bear behind your truck
293266,irishfield,2009-01-16 20:07:00,26272,That won't work in Raf's Jeep Johnny... unless he fixed that heater core! lol
293315,Joey,2009-01-16 22:23:00,9122, Can't find it DouG.  I've had to reformat my puter since then.  I'll see if I can find it on a disc.  Joey
