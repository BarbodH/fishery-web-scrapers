292314,cityfisher,2009-01-14 20:53:00,959,"Hi all,  My quad has been acting up lately and want to get it tuned up so I can get out a couple times for some hardwater action.  Can anyone recommend a good mechanic that works on Arctic Cat Atvs in the GTA?  or if anyone has any experience with these quads ( carb issue ) can shed any light that would be great. Im tempted taking it apart myself but rather do it with someone with some experience ( Beer and Pizza to any takers !  : )) or just pass it over to a mechanic.  ++++++ Issue ++++++ quad has been in storage for the last 2 months(put in sea foam before storage as a stablizer ) started up the quad today and it is acting VERY weird... throttle is very inconsistant... it seems to be choking...hesistating... i attempted to drive down the street and it strugged doing just that.  *** My choke cable broke a while back and its been a pain to get her started, ussually if I just TUG on the choke cable is chokes it enough to start.  i have attached a video of me starting the quad and hiting the throttle  http://www.flickr.com/gp/10557032@N05/4vZanV"
292316,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-14 20:58:00,1362,Was it stored indoors or out and when did it start acting up????
292320,danbo,2009-01-14 21:02:00,2646,Jets are plugged up..not getting fuel.
292321,cityfisher,2009-01-14 21:02:00,959,"stored outdoors under a tarp, loss of power just started a couple days when I tried to get her going.  Choke cable broke 6 months ago and have been either covering up the snorkel to get her started or now ( doesnt work when its this cold ) I pull on the choke cable and it starts up. It just has no power... struggles under throttle"
292323,richyb,2009-01-14 21:03:00,774,sounds like its choking on water ?    after plowing through a field in 2 feet of powder mine did that for about 100 yards going up the road and would only move at about 5 mph. Then it finaly cleared itself and runs fine. I figured i got snow in the air intake.  try putting some gas line antifreeze in it and let it run for a while .    worth a shot .

292326,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-14 21:05:00,1362,I was gonna mention gas line anti-freeze as well....sounds like you've got some water in your gas....
292327,cityfisher,2009-01-14 21:08:00,959," Thats the first thing I did, put in a bottle.. let it sit and still no luck... then I put in some Card Cleaner in the Carb Throats( its a v2 ) and in the gas...Other than filling my street with Smoke that didnt help either."
292329,richyb,2009-01-14 21:12:00,774,plugs are fine ?
292334,cityfisher,2009-01-14 21:27:00,959,"good question, they are in a tough spot. Ill have to get to them and find out."
292337,GEO,2009-01-14 21:41:00,22,Try changing the plugs or wires sound like its not firing.
292338,irishfield,2009-01-14 21:42:00,26272,Sounds like it's choking on all the crap that seafoam stirred up !  Those ABS pipes.. are they on the bike... or is that the intake/exhaust for a high efficiency gas furnace?? Moisture soaked fuel and ignition module from it's exhaust by chance?
292344,dagoat_1,2009-01-14 21:54:00,72,"You have the same bike i do.  you are running it with half choke.  Exactly the same way my bike was running last year when the choke broke.  The V2 have a know issue with the cable seizing where it forks into the two carbs, hense the reason the choke cable or plastic lever breaks.  I had to spray lube into the cable and move it until it freed up. (took some time to free it)  or purchase a new cable and the new plastic lever.  All AC dealers stoke these as they know they all break after a few years.  Free the cable and your bike will run fine. If you need some good directions go to www.arcticchat.com tons of guys with the same issue. Goodluck!"
292364,cityfisher,2009-01-14 22:37:00,959, Thanks ! Im going to order a new cable get started !
