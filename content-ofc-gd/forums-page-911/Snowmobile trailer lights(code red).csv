I tested a new one and bam i had power.   truck was fine other than the parking lights......... fuse was busted...... a heads up there are 2 fuses lol.....   I wired up a new harness,  put in a new light bulb and tested them all agian.  I noticed that when i put on my turn signal  all my lights would flash.  Seems like i had the bulbs in wrong.   Fixed that and fellas its all good to go.... I wanna thank everyone for thier imput without u guys i was lost.  Its good to know that when people are in a pinch us ofners can put our heads together to find a fix. I am   truly greatfull.........    Buckster(Tony)"
293717,Sinker,2009-01-17 19:37:00,8692,"Good to hear!!!  Those adapters are a PITA. I wire mine direct, 4way to 4way. No adapters. i've seen them mess up a few times now. They're just another piece that will break along the line. Simple is better. Maybe get a spare to keep in the truck for next time it decides to blow up on you..........  Good luck tomorrow!!!  Sinker"

293793,Bernie,2009-01-17 23:54:00,3190,Glad to see the problem solved. Go and catch a fish or two.
293486,Sinker,2009-01-17 04:13:00,8692,"I would first think its a fuse. If you've replaced ALL the fuses, I'd then suspect the light socket is welded together, and keeps blowing the fuses.  Do what sonny said, dissconnect the problem light before replacing any more fuses, and see if the rest of the lights work, and go from there.  The signals and brake lights working with no running lights sounds like a definite ground issue. Sometimes on those tilt trailers, you'll lose the ground thru the trailer. I run a separate ground to each light to remedy this problem......its 99% of all trailer light issues!!  Thats about all I can do from here bud!  Good luck! You only have till wed to get er working  Sinker"
293496,buckster,2009-01-17 04:37:00,530,thanks everyone........ im gonna tackle this in the morning.  I took out my manual and there is another fuse box under the seat like sonny said..... for the trailer park lights.... i havent looked to see if that was blown.   As for the Lturn/rturn fuses they are fine.   Its hard to tell if fuse 32 is blown cause its a diffrent kinda fuse.  I wish i had more experience with this stuff but im gonn giver crap in the am.........  I want to at least get out on sunday!
293581,sonny,2009-01-17 14:49:00,511,"Hope all goes well,,keep us informed!"
293584,Bernie,2009-01-17 14:52:00,3190,"The reason I said to check the output at the back first is to save time.  If they work there, that's it, you are done there. No searching for fuses. Then you can get on to the trailer. You said you wanted it fixed in a hurry. It was tried on two different vehicles with NO lights. Law of average it is in the trailer."
