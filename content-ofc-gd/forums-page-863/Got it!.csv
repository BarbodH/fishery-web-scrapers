331384,GBW,2009-04-18 02:05:00,8460,"OOOOOHHHH yeah!  I just got off the phone with the land owner telling me ""yes I can fish on his land as long as I keep it clean""!!!!!  Yeeeee HAAAAAAAAA  Now I can't wait for opener, otherwise I would have had to wait till the weekend was over to fish the other spots...  Oh I'm so happy as there are 3 pools holding fish on his land....  WEEEEEE (I feel like a kid right now... )"
331385,Beats,2009-04-18 02:14:00,543,"  So, how did you you know this beforehand?    j/k, sounds like you have a nice spot there."
331386,misfish,2009-04-18 02:15:00,29133,WHERE?
331388,e-z-out,2009-04-18 02:17:00,1052,  We all want to know now spill it
331391,BillM,2009-04-18 02:19:00,17367,Let's hope no one in a kayak or pontoon is already there fishing your holes
331392,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-18 02:20:00,10439,  Some prime water on the Don River!!!!!!
331394,e-z-out,2009-04-18 02:23:00,1052,  Only thing in that water is
331398,Joeytier,2009-04-18 02:27:00,3990,Have you been bombarded with PM's yet?
331401,GBW,2009-04-18 02:34:00,8460,"LOL @ all of you... Beats, I was given a ""look see"" by others last year who had access but wouldn't let me fish with out permission. All I can say is DURHAM area..."
331402,e-z-out,2009-04-18 02:37:00,1052,  Going to put a GPS tag on your car lol
331403,GBW,2009-04-18 02:44:00,8460,Make sure you get the van then...
331419,misfish,2009-04-18 03:20:00,29133,"I got a bead on you ,when you visit up this way."
331531,GBW,2009-04-18 18:17:00,8460,I should be up there at the end of the month for a family b-day party.  I'll see if I can bring my gear
331533,osmondrs,2009-04-18 18:33:00,61,"Good going, Jeff...  have fun!"
331542,Terry,2009-04-18 19:18:00,14456,did you tell him you are bringing 200 of your closest OFC friends fishing with you  LOL
331560,Dara,2009-04-18 20:13:00,3052,"  Being as you're in Brooklin, that makes sense.    Hey..do you know Mack the woodworker?"
331562,Sinker,2009-04-18 20:15:00,8692,"I dunno. If I took a buddy to one of my spots on private property, that I had gained permission for, and then he turned around and asked for and recieved permission, I'd be a little ticked off.......no??  Sinker"
331563,Terry,2009-04-18 20:27:00,14456,"I think I read it the other way, his friend took him to see the water but told him he couldn't fish it till he got permission from the owner.... I don't know"
331565,kemper,2009-04-18 20:30:00,2232, Thats how i read it too
331604,buckster,2009-04-18 22:23:00,530, Just a little ticked off?
331613,GBW,2009-04-18 22:41:00,8460,"Correct.  I had seen people fishing there last year so I pulled over to say hi.  They let me come have a look see but told me I cannot fish with out consent of the land owner.  This year, I have it...  Dara, I might if he has a charter sticker on the back of his truck.  His father (if it is the person I'm thinking of) has the place by the C-store."
331615,DanD,2009-04-18 22:43:00,2223,All I can say GBW is good for you; what you did/got will hopefully help other respectful people access. You got more then just access though; you gained the land ownerâ€™s respect and a possible future friendship. If more people did this there would be a lot less NO TRESPASSING signs. Thanks.  Dan.
331617,GBW,2009-04-18 22:46:00,8460,Thanks Dan.  I have my gear packed and ready to go too!  Along with 5 garbage bags as the place looks to be a mess right now...
331636,Dara,2009-04-18 23:33:00,3052,"Nope GWB, he doesn't fish. He is a cranky old retired from Bell guy that is into turning pens right now. Lives in east of the CIBC I think.  Oh well, congrats on the permission  Signed Dara who lives in an area where there is no need to ask for permission to fish anywhere thankfully."
