331693,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 01:28:00,0,open water splakin' can be pretty tough compared to the winter months.  trolling/casting small spoons are an excellent starting point. if you can get your hands on some small white tubes of 2 or 2.5 inches in length i've heard they are the ticket for open water splakin.  i myself seldom fish them in open water.

If I were tieing something on before hitting the water, that would be it. BUT, I make sure I have a selection of spoons: not just colours, but shape and size as well. Some days, size is more important than colour. Last spring we were on a small splake lake that produces good-sized fish. It didn't matter what colour spoon you threw, as long as it was a 1/3 oz Cleo. I tried downsizing with no luck. I threw every colour of that size I had and caught fish on it. Small countdown raps are my other favourite.  I don't troll a lot for splake, but fish them more like brookies: lots of casting to shoreline structure, downed trees, steep dropoffs and across points."

Used to be very good there but have not done it for ages, like the above posters i generally just threw some spoons. I also had a bit of luck with the old Canadian Wrigger. Look for fast water depth changes, they seem to be the preferred hideout. best of luck."
