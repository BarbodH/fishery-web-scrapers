331430,cram,2009-04-18 04:21:00,1733," Absolutely am.  You described a  cormorant cull as ""ecosystem management"" or playing god......i think managing the fish population, whether it be through preventing overfishing or stocking species in ecosystems where those species had not previously been (or survived) is as ""godlike"" as determining that the cormorants are a nuisance and should be limited (or eliminated)."
331431,cram,2009-04-18 04:24:00,1733,"Also, Dr......tell me -- is the cormorant growth in ontario over the past 10 yrs more like that of a native species or an invasive one?  I think the cormorant is effectively invasive now since it hasn't been here for so long."

Man has removed the predators from the ecosystem and that is why there is an ""overpopulation"" in some areas.  Many of you are complaining about the trees that cormorants kill while nesting. Think about the number of trees that are completely wiped out by the ever expanding urban sprawl around Toronto.  There is ABSOLUTELY no comparison.  Shooting protected vultures??????? Man is the dominant creature so far, we have the right to defend what we want??????  These sentiments are problematic."

There is no political will to take the steps necessary to control a massive overpopulation. I'm sure most people wouldn't have an issue if it were only a few birds but once you've seen clouds and clouds of the black eating/crapping machines fly overhead or fished downwind of a colony it's very frustrating knowing nothing is being done and that you are unable to take any consequential action on your own."

The loons comment was a joke but I hear they taste a bit like bald eagle. I have seen lots of cormorant islands and yes they are not beautiful.  We should stop the bailout of GM and use the money to have all the laid-off workers trained to destroy the cormorants and then we could use the dead cormorants to feed the poor. Also we could issue tags to hunters who want to blast a few (could replace going to the driving range in spring). With all the saved cash we could reduce the need for the new HST tax, the unemployed will be busy killing birds and the poor will be well feed.  Problem solved, let's go fish."

330948,Northhunter,2009-04-16 23:02:00,214,"Everyone keeps mentioning reports/studies or lack thereof. I was working for a short while in an MNR fish lab about the time the MNR's first report came out (about 2006?). It was at the end of a 5-year study and their conclusion was basically what everyone already knew - that the exploding populations are detrimental to fish stocks. The senior fish tech I was working under basically said something to the effect of ""Now watch and see what kind of crap hits the fan"". They had the study and all kinds of data to back up bringing in place some sort of population control, but there was too much politics involved with all the special interest groups and tree huggers, etc. (not unlike the bear hunt). So the MNR copped out and went ahead with another 5-year study. At the time I believe they said it was to then monitor whether or not the populations would come down on their own. I'm not sure what became of it.. dust in the wind?  Yes, they will eat smelts, alewife, etc. They are also a major problem on inland lakes where those species don't exist. Then they hit the yellow perch. Yellow perch are not really a prized sportfish, but they are what prized sportfish eat (walleye especially). You do the math.  And, yes. They are native. But in about 100 years of species monitoring in Algonquin they were never present until this recent explosion (something to consider). There are now islands on lakes in the park that have met the same demise as people here are describing now.  Dr. Salvelinus - wikipedia, Really?"
330953,irishfield,2009-04-16 23:27:00,26272," Cormorant Recipe  Having shot your cormorant, hold it well away from you as you carry it home; these birds are exceedingly verminous and the lice are said to be not entirely host-specific. Hang up by the feet with a piece of wire, soak in petrol and set on fire. This treatment both removes most of the feathers and kills the lice.  When the smoke has cleared away, take the cormorant down and cut off the beak. Send this to the local Conservancy Board who, if you are in the right area, will give you 3/6d or sometimes 5/- for it. Bury the carcase, preferably in a light sandy soil, and leave it there for a fortnight. This is said to improve the flavour by removing, in part at least, the taste of rotting fish.  Dig up and skin and draw the bird. Place in a strong salt and water solution and soak for 48 hours. Remove, dry, stuff with whole, unpeeled onions: the onion skins are supposed to bleach the meat to a small extent, so that it is very dark brown instead of being entirely black.  Simmer gently in seawater, to which two tablespoons of chloride of lime have been added, for six hours. This has a further tenderising effect. Take out of the water and allow to dry, meanwhile mixing up a stiff paste of methylated spirit and curry powder.  Spread this mixture liberally over the breast of the bird.  Finally roast in a very hot oven for three hours. The result is unbelievable. Throw it away. Not even a starving vulture would eat it."

For anyone in the GTA, who's not seen the devastation these birds have created, just take yourself and or you family for a nice walk on the Leslie Spit nature trail... you will notice as you get toward the end of the spit, there is a section of the Spit that looks like it was ripped from the moon and dropped onto the inner harbour of Toronto. These birds can be seen all along the shores of Lake O and there is a constant stream of them flying back and forth from feeding grounds to their nests. The conservation authority is having a very difficult time deciding what course of action to take... leave them alone and let them destroy the whole spit, or cull them and have all the bleeding heart ""naturalists"" climbing up and down their back.

331184,cram,2009-04-17 14:33:00,1733," You miss the point -- we played god with ecosystem management by killing these things off and removing them from the ecosystem for decades and now letting them back to flourish.  Besides, the very phrase ""ecosystem management"" which is the field i assume you work in infers playing god.  Why would managing the cormorant population any less ""godlike"" than managing deer or fish stocks?  Further, while i respect the academic/scientific process it is VERY slow and in a case like this i think you'll find the outcome will be the same but it will be too late.   Eventually you guys will slowly and deliberately conclude that YES, there is a negative impact and they need to be culled.....by then they will be MUCH harder to manage than they are now."
331188,bigfish1965,2009-04-17 14:44:00,3382," Well, Dr... you know as much as anyone what a population absent of predators does. It grows until the food source is exhausted. Then it expands its range, and does the same thing over and over. This happens until all food sources are gone and eventually disease kills them off. By then some of the previously exhausted food sources come back...some will not. The cormorant is a upper-level predator with an unusually high reproduction rate. The risks in ecological terms of inaction are too great. Down here we don't have many cormorants primarily because of human shoreline incursion. But we have deer..lots of them. And we are their only predator so it falls upon us to try and maintain numbers that do not risk the population of other species whether that be plant or animal. This is no different. Where we have displaced or extirpated predators, it is sound practice to take over that role. The invasive zebra mussel has been the catalyst to all of this by reducing, or in some places eliminating water turbidity."
331214,majorlifts,2009-04-17 16:31:00,171,"I will have to agree with the Dr. By the way,Humans do more damage to our ecosystem than any other creature on earth, so should we start doing the honorable thing for the ecosystem and start sending people to the annihilation chambers in order to save the planet??...........Hmmm seems we had a guy try that in the 30`s, didnt turn out so well for him, and no argument here will ever solve the planets doom due to humanity, forget your Ivy  league problem solving Ideas, and save them for the people who have never stepped out of a concrete building to see the forest beyond the trees.  Just for info sake, the Leslie Spit is all a man made human dump. I take my boat down and all you see are Islands filled with concrete and bricks from old buildings, so all that Bird Guano grosses me out, but so does the garbage. The birds need a place to live, we destroy land to build and live and this has massive impact on our inviro. Ask the Algonquin tribe of natives that have been fighting a uranium mining company that has plans to destroy thousands of hectares of land for profits. This topic has wore itself out and is already a dead horse."

Most people on this site have witnessed their overpopulated numbers first hand. As for the argument that man should stay out of it and just let things progress naturally then let's look at the flip side of the coin. Does that mean man shouldn't play god by creating fish in hatcheries for stocking? or how about the wild turkey program? isn't that playing god also?  Man has destroyed the natural ecosystem like it or not and it is up to us to try and manage it, and right now the cormorant population needs culled and it doesn't take a university education to see that."

Just because somebody disagrees with a cormorant cull doesn't mean they are bleeding heart tree huggers or if they agree they are god-playing butchers.  Are cormorants a problem or are they a result of a problem?  Just an idea, but maybe we should cull the zebra mussels that are clearing the water, giving cormorants an advantage to exploit their food source. Sounds a little tougher as they make small targets but after seeing some of the almost tasty recipes posted on here, anything is possible.  Personally I feel shooting them is a bandaid solution, not addressing the root problem. They survived here for 100 years without a population explosion, something kept them supressed.

I can't see a negative impact on any other living creature with the demise of the cormorant. Am I missing something ?  If these cormorant lovers have a few birds hanging around their own properties, destroying their vegetation and stinking up the place, I'm sure they wouldn't be so opposed to a cull. They're always ready to oppose necessary measures to control wildlife somewhere else, but when it's happening in their own backyard, the tune changes quickly.  How many people in Newmarket, Ontario supported the cancellation of the spring bear hunt to protect those cute, cuddly bears they see on TV, then turned around and wanted more control measures put in place when bears were spotted running around on their city streets and in their yards recently?"

First argument I heard was ""cormorants are eating all the fish"" Science showed that they consume predominantly alewife, shad, smelt, etc.,  Then people started to say they were eating all the prey species, thus causing the crash in salmonids. So science showed that the NATIVE TO CANADA cormorants were eating a miniscule portion of the prey species (.5%) and that the NON-NATIVE sport fish were eating a much more significant 13%.  Now the argument has shifted to their nesting sites and the damage they cause.  Do they kill trees?  Certainly!  Is their crap disgusting?  You bet it is!  Most poop is!   BUT to suggest that we should be destroying a naturally flourishing species to make OFAH feel good is ludicrous.  There will be an inevitable decline in the species.  It's basic population dynamics.  Spending money and resources on culling is simply DELAYING the crash in populations that will happen.

If the last real study on cormorants was 16 years ago, isn't it time they do a more current assessment. In this matter though, as someone stated above, it's a matter of common sense!  Closed beaches, dwindling fish populations, bullying other native birds off nesting site, habitat  and vegetation destruction etc.. Can't be ignored...  Do these extreme activist even see any of this? Most likely not... All they see is the killing of a cute feathery animal.... Ignoring all the negative affects the species is having on the native environment.  But HEY... it's a cute BIRD!!!!! Why not defend the Round Goby??? Not cute enough for you .. They'll be the first to your boat to protest when killing a cormorant, but will they be they when your culling Gobies from Lake Erie...  HEll NO....  If your going to jump on the bandwagon and be the defenders of God's creatures, no matter how justifiable it is to cull that species. Why discriminate and only stand up for cute animals you can use as poster child.  Imagine Bono and Madonna, starting an activist campaign for Zebra mussels! LIke hell that's going to happen, can't market themselves with that species like they can with a cute little harp seal pup! Some people should stick to their bloody day jobs, and let the people who've gone to school for this stuff do what they need to do..."

330839,cram,2009-04-16 18:56:00,1733," I (think I) have a pretty solid grasp of (introductory) population dynamics...i`m just wondering which pressure(s) you feel will ultimately bring them back down?  I think that while they are a native species, their long absence essentially makes them an invasive species.  The natural predation etc no longer exists to control them.   This is not like a rabbit population that peaks, followed by their predators bringing them back down,a nd cycling back and forth (the most basic example of pop dynamics).  I can`t think of a single downward pressure on these birds,....are we waiting for disease, or MUCH worse - lack of food?  They are also  benefiting from artifical conditions created by us or other invasive species (ie....clearer water).  I am generally a fan of letting nature work itself out, but in this case i see nothing but negative impact from t his highly invasive species."
330840,hotrod,2009-04-16 19:01:00,103,"Politics have everything to do with the mnr's reluctance to tackle the issue and they don't want to get their hands dirty, like the cancellation of the spring bear hunt. The CO's in the field know how much damage the birds do and don't need a study to draw their own conclusions but they have no power. I think the reasons there haven't been any recent studies done is because they are unnecessary. All one has to do is look around them on the infected waterbodies to see the damage caused and realize something needs to be done to cull the entire population, not just one area of the province."
330843,Michael_Brown,2009-04-16 19:14:00,411,"We should kill all the loons while were at it. I mean the darn things are just a cormorant with pretty feathers. Hope nobody looks at us as invasive.  What has been suggested is spending lots of money to ""reduce"" the number of cormorants. Maybe we could scrape the gun registry and use the money to blast birds.  How much are we looking to spend for this?  We will not get rid of them, if you kill them off they will return to fill the void left by the cull. It's like cutting your lawn and clear water is fertilizer. Unless someone has a good recipe for them we'd better get use to them until their population levels off.   If only they ate purple loosestrife.  I don't like them either but imagine the money it would cost us to temporarily reduce them."
330846,hotrod,2009-04-16 19:28:00,103,"I don't think it would cost too much at all if they just had an open season on them as pests and let the guys shoot them, they wouldn't get a chance to come back if they were constantly under fire, kinda like when you cut your grass when it gets too long. Loons vs cormorants is apples and oranges, there aren't thousands of loons destroying the ecosystem they inhabit."
330850,Terry,2009-04-16 19:37:00,14456,"the reason they are giving out more moose and deer tags now, is to cull the heard, it is a management tool that does work and the same should happen with the  commiRat cormorant....they no longer have predators  that will eat them, so we need to kill them  and if loon numbers get out of hand, of course we should find a way to reduce their numbers"
330853,cram,2009-04-16 19:45:00,1733, Loons and cormorants are completely different.   I assume you havent seen a thriving cormorant community.
329846,chukkk,2009-04-14 02:36:00,57,"Shots will ring out on Middle Island as early as Friday as Parks Canada officials begin culling double-crested cormorants for a second year, according to an animal rights advocate.  Parks officials were unavailable for comment Monday because of the Easter holiday, but bird advocates who've fought the action say they have been told the park plans to cull six to eight days over four weeks.  About 211 cormorants were killed in last year’s cull on the Lake Erie island, said Julie Woodyer, a representative with Cormorant Defenders International, a group that opposes culling.  “We met with (Parks Canada) recently to organize being out there to observe (the culling) and they said, ‘oh by the way we are going to kill 3,000 to 4,000 (birds) over eight days.’” Woodyer said.  “I think that’s why they only got 211,” she said. “We remain unsure about how they can kill thousands without significant injures to other birds. It’s also a big disturbance. They said they aren’t going to deviate from humane procedures.”  Efforts by animal rights group Zoocheck Canada Inc. to get a court injunction to stop bird culling at Middle Island, which is part of Point Pelee National Park, failed a year ago.  Last spring, Parks Canada said it planned to reduce the colony from 4,026 nests to between 438 and 876 over five years.    http://www.windsorstar.com/Cormorant+cull+...2853/story.html"

Here in Kingston for those that know the area, the Brothers Islands are terrible and very little tree life is left. In the summer, you can't get close due to the stench, bugs and water contanimation. 2 Islands have been completey destroyed and a 3rd, maybe 1/4 left.  It's not right that you can't moore there anymore and enjoy the water and scenery.  Grrrrrrrr......  Cheers,  Paul"

330017,JohnF,2009-04-14 18:14:00,3494,"People don't always understand that certain plants and critters are introduced to an area where they don't have natural predators to keep their numbers down, so man has to step up and do the deed. And there are some bleeding hearts who don't really care what happens as long as the little critters are preserved from harm.  As someone suggested, perhaps they need to live on a small island with a flock of the durned things for a while. I wonder if folks like that mind having mice in their cupboards.  JF"
330023,Cast-Away,2009-04-14 18:27:00,790,I think that this image says it all. I've seen it posted on the board in the past.   
330028,hotrod,2009-04-14 18:57:00,103,"Action needs to be taken across the entire province, and they should do it on a large scale.

330088,outllaw,2009-04-14 21:58:00,1232,"right near me. i hope to see the cormorants put in check. they have already killed the erie shoals. young of the year bass have been wiped out. ask any c.o. in southern ontario. ohio has been pleading also. problems are other nesting birds are being disturbed.they should also introduce skunks, and racoons. they would get fat."
330092,irishfield,2009-04-14 22:07:00,26272, Yah.. but I'd prefer not to be in the targetted boat next round....
330356,legacey,2009-04-15 15:11:00,127,"Around Kingston, in the summer I hear a few boats going close to the Brothers Islands...a lot of gun fire and the boats taking off quickly. It's unfortunate that people are needing to take matters into they're own hands.  Their waste is what I think keeps closing the only Kingston public beach; Rotary Park. When we get a South wind for a couple of days, the crap from these islands blow towards land. You can be sured it closes due to contanimated water shortly there after."

The introduction of another species to help kill off others hasn't worked to well though, IMHO. Look at the intro of the fischers. Damn things got my cat last year in Amhestview and many others too.
