331224,danc,2009-04-17 17:08:00,4677,Geez. I've recovered about 40% of my losses in the past 6 weeks or so. Are thing looking up? Have we bottomed out?
331228,fishing,2009-04-17 17:27:00,167,I think so. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/sto...Story/WBmarkets
331229,irishfield,2009-04-17 17:28:00,26272,So 40% of 40%.. you're up 16.. or still down 24? Guess I'll have to take a peek tonight... hate to.. it always puts me in a foul mood !
331236,danc,2009-04-17 17:39:00,4677,  I hear ya Wayne. I hated to look for the longest time too. But it might lift your spirits to have a quick peak right now. There is a glimmer of hope on the horizon.

When the RSP deadline came last month, I plunked down the whole wad to max out.   I'm glad i did that way because that particular portfolio did nothing but drop after every contribution until recently.   It felt like I was trying to fill a bath tub with the stopper pulled out."
331267,Garnet,2009-04-17 19:05:00,2056,I kept buy right thru the down turn dividend paying stocks only.  Stopped  buying 2 weeks ago as the market is getting way ahead of it's self.   Will tank before summer then rally thru the summer and tank large in the fall and thats when I will start buying again.   Garnet

I don't know if we'll test the bottom again but there is a drop coming, later this year we might see a sustainable recovery. If you are dollar cost averaging, don't worry about it, you'll be fine."
