330598,alexmedic,2009-04-16 01:45:00,186,Does anyone know how much Soldier's Bay Marine charges to launch a boat?  We are thinking of heading that way for some crappie this weekend...
331603,kayak fisher,2009-04-18 22:20:00,66,I unfortunately can't help you as I am not familiar with the Marina.  However I also have a question regarding the area.  I have a canoe and I would like to go up there tomorrow morning.  Can someone please let me know where I could pick up some minnows and where I can park/put the canoe in the water.  Thanks- all help is greatly appreciated!
331629,chukkk,2009-04-18 23:24:00,57,The Marina is flooded and you cant get to the boat ramp. Other than that they charge $10.00 There is a spot along the bank where you can launch easily it is on the road in Just before the marina private road a guy launched a 26 foot boat there today Actually I like that spot better than the Marina and it eas the Marina owner who told me about it and its free with parking straight ahead of the ramp.  As far as minnows goes I don't know I by the  in Markham on the way. There is not much being caught today in the way of Crappie . Catfish on worms are plentiful.
