Up before the sun,and headed for some perch,n.  Before I got to bussiness,I threw a party for myself    The oldest boy came down .He will never put that float rod away.He just loves it for all his fishing.      The action was pretty good for the first couple of hours,then died off.Fish seem to be in the deeper sections of the marina.Manage to get a feed for me mudder.      I must say,it sure was nice to get out there .Might just try it again."
