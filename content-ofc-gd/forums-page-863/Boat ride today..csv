331338,Bernie,2009-04-18 00:06:00,3190,It's been a long winter and even a longer time since the last boat ride. It was so nice today that I hooked up to a boat and away I went. Stopped by the house and pulled on some long underwear cause it usually gets a little chilly out on the lake this time of year.    When I arrived at Wades Landing there wasn't a lineup to launch today.    Sure feels good to hop in a boat......even if it is a tiller    This was as far as I expected to get today. One more week and should be able to get the last kilometer across Hunters Bay. I can see my place across the bay.   Still some thick ice to melt. This time last year it was long gone from here.   Came across this guy near our boathouse.   And that is todays report.
331342,Joeytier,2009-04-18 00:13:00,3990,Shoulda brought the auger and hopped out onto the ice.
331343,Joey,2009-04-18 00:15:00,9122,Great report and vids Bernie.  Looking good.  Can't wait to get out there.  Joey
331347,misfish,2009-04-18 00:23:00,29133,"Short boat ride,is better then none at all. Still lots of ice.WOW.  Oh forgot to mention,you guys are getting snow next week."
331348,irishfield,2009-04-18 00:24:00,26272,Aluminum Bernie... your Grandfather would roll..
331349,JohnF,2009-04-18 00:25:00,3494," Will it be a real boat when it grows up???  Actually, it beats the pants off my boat (there isn't one) but I remember the days of having a 5 1/2 horse Johnson (burgubdy coloured) & a little plywood flat bottom on the river beside my folks' place when I was growing up. It took me years to get used to not being able to just run down to the dock and head up the river whenever the spirit moved me. I really really wanna boat again, dammit.  JF"
331350,misfish,2009-04-18 00:28:00,29133, Hey John Lets split on one and keep it here. You can come up anytime:D

331390,Bernie,2009-04-18 02:18:00,3190,"Hope the weather stays warm for a few more days. NO MORE SNOW! (Thinking positive thoughts here)    Possibly Wayne, but from what I know of my Grandpa he was a progressive thinking man. He would have been fascinated by aluminum boats and I would bet he would have made some himself had he lived a full life. He was a blacksmith/mechanic/engineer by trade and apparently could fix most everything. Wish I could have met him."
331457,ccmtcanada,2009-04-18 11:22:00,7971,"Not that I didn't thoroughly enjoy ice fishing there this past winter Bernie, but I'm looking forward to fishing there when all that cold stuff has melted!!!  Great videos...getting our boat out of the garage today!  Unfortunately, it's going to stay there...LOL...maybe take it out soon."
