331717,rbaquial,2009-04-19 02:20:00,968," I think the truck expects you to stick around and ""cuddle"" after a long ""ride"""
331718,misfish,2009-04-19 02:23:00,29133, You do have a sence of humor.

331803,Marc Thorpe,2009-04-19 09:22:00,621,"  No Dude,you gotta get down on it  TKS Tybo,gonna bring it in and get the Logos changed  Tybo you gotta admit Dodge has quite the ""BOX"" You should see her when I have her on all ""fours""  I think I will have written on the back cap ""Grab life by the Uterus"" or "" Slide her in""   Figures Holdie would put a pictures of dragging his nuts I'd go as far as to say his model is ""Kick Start"""
331811,duckdog,2009-04-19 11:44:00,162,Its what gives birth to all the little chevy trucks lol
331885,jjcanoe,2009-04-19 15:09:00,744,I thought the F series fords were the girl trucks  Remember when Homer bought the F series Canyonero and he had to give it to Marge to stop the ridicule of Carl and Lenny for having a Girl truck....
