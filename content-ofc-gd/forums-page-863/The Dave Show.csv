Hometownhandyman was giving Powis and DeRose a good run for the money. Then Nautifish and my Mrs got into the act with Dave. Funny.   Gotta love being in the rowdy seats  Subway was more than generous as a sponsor. Free eats ,and a gift card.  Finally, if only briefly, I met the boss and his ""boss"" and more people than I can put name to at the moment. Well worth the drive out."
