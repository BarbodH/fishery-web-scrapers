Bought: size 10 streamer hooks gold beads lead wire Blk and bwn hackle orange blk and bwn marabou orange blk and bwn chenille crystal flash  All came down to $40 or so, which is not bad I guess.  Got home and start trying things out. 4 wolly buggers (bottom right was the first fly, I didnt like how the hackle was very long in the begining, so I start to triming it, and got carried away, Im sure it'll still catch fish.) Lesson: use the hackel tip for smaller flies   Some rabbit jig (the suckers actully hit these jigs very hard, when I set the lead close to bottom. Good alternative for people who just want to catch something)   A box of goodies, some store bought.   Thanks for all you who helped me in the first place! Youtube is pretty awsome, there was at least 10+ video tutorial on how to tye these buggers."

331802,drwxr,2009-04-19 08:31:00,453,"looks realy good. if you  want the hackle to be shorter to have to use saddle hackle, its diferent."
331813,MJL,2009-04-19 12:16:00,2427,"Great flies!  They look great  I usually don’t worry much about hackle length much when I tie mine.  Like Efka mentioned, if you’re looking for shorter hackle, saddle hackle will tie up real nice without being long and they give a very buggy appearance to the fly.  A lot of my woolly buggers have long hackles made out of schlappen as it gives the fly a very nice pulsating action when I’m swinging them with the fly rod or I’m fishing in slow to med-fast water under the float.  Tie on a small pink or orange head made of chenille or a small yarn egg at the eye of the hook and you have another great steelhead fly.  Fly tying is addictive!"
