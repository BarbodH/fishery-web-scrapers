331715,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-19 02:07:00,0,Headed to the salmon river on tuesday for a week in pulaski for work.  Definitely going to do some dropback fishin on the salmon river. If I have a day with a reasonable amount of free time I was thinking about heading to the DSR. Has anybody fished it?  Are the lower holes less pressured?  Cheers!
