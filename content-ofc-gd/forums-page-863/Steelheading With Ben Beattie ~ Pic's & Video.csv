331312,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-17 22:28:00,10439,"Ahhhh yes, steelhead, I remember them.  I have to console myself with another weekend of icefishing.     I miss that river too. Nice chromers Mikey!!!!"
331327,irishfield,2009-04-17 23:28:00,26272,"I'm surprised that when you told him you had rubbers and a rod for him, Ben didn't bolt !!!!  Looks like it worked out well...."
331400,trapshooter,2009-04-18 02:31:00,1234,"Wow Mike, you made it look like I knew what I was doing!! hahaha.  Great report buddy.  What a fantastic summary of our day, awesome pics and vids.  That was too much fun and I know we'll have a 'round two'.  Isn't anybody going to poke fun at my spinning reel?  lol.  Honestly, steelheading/floatfishing isn't as easy as you guys make it look.  I kinda felt like a fish out of water, however, I had a great teacher... with the patience of a saint!!  Thanks again Mike, it was definitely a trip I'll never forget.  Steve - pleasure to finally meet you.  Funny that it wasn't even a fishing related event.  Neil was awesome!!  Everybody Knows This is Nowhere was my fav but there were a lot of great classics.  Down by The River, also incredable.  And I could go on, and on, and on.........  Good to meet you and dave as well, Will."
331405,Bernie,2009-04-18 02:50:00,3190,Well done guys! They look like a riot to catch too. Great post.
331460,solopaddler,2009-04-18 11:50:00,8605," Hey cool you're around, didn't think you'd be near a computer anytime soon.  Hopefully you and the boys are busy pounding big lakers."
331465,Spiel,2009-04-18 12:02:00,9065," No worries Mike, perhaps we can hook up for some fresh fall silver this year. Love the fall silver."
331469,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-18 13:20:00,1362,"What a great report and pics Mike!!...Ben, it must have been a blast fighting all those steelies and having a great guide/coach with you!!..congrats guys!!...the last time I tried fishing river steelies was back in the early 1980's"
331200,solopaddler,2009-04-17 15:40:00,8605,"Living and guiding full time in N/W Ontario steelhead aren't normally on Bens radar. However a short trip back home to southern Ontario provided the perfect opportunity to remedy that particular situation.  We'd made plans to meet and fish together on Thursday and his timing couldn't have been better: beautiful clear skies, comfortable temps and once again a river full of hungry dropback fish.  Ben had never fished for steelhead in a river before but not surprisingly he's a pretty fishy individual and caught on pretty quick.  Fortunately I had enough gear to outfit him completely (waders, rod/reel, etc, etc) so we were good to go.  Thursday morning was a bit tiring for both of us. Ben had a full 11/2 hours of sleep after hitting the Neil Young concert Wed night then driving out to my place for 4:30am. Me? I was going on andrenaline once again after fishing hard the day before..  It's all good though, nothing a 6 pack of Java Monsters can't handle.  Here's Ben wading a river for the first time. A little tentative at first but as you'll see by the end of the day he was charging right in.    Upon arriving at our chosen hole it didn't take Ben long to break the ice. The particular pool we were fishing has just the right combination of current speed, depth, size and cover to attract huge numbers of spent fish. After doing the nasty upstream earlier in the spring they were kicking back on their lazy boys enjoying a smoke before heading back to the lake. Fortunately for us they had a bad case of the munchies as well.    Maybe 2 minutes later he hooked up again and I managed to capture a short video clip of the action:    Some still shots:      He got in a pretty good little groove there for a while:      I even hooked a few myself.          At this point Ben hooked a fish that jumped wildly multiple times. I managed another short video clip of the action:    It was a golden day, couldn't have been any more perfect.    Mixed in with the steelies were an ever increasing number of coarse fish. Maybe not the prettiest fish in the world but they do put a good bend in the rod:      Ben began to put on a clinic:                     Cool shots dontcha think?       In between playing photographer I managed a few more myself.        Near the end of the day we slipped downstream and found a huge pod of fish, mostly small jacks in the 3-5lb class, but all were pure chrome and the aerial acrobats were something to see.  Unfortunately not too many pic's of the action (yes I do get tired of taking pictures  )    As mentioned earlier Ben was a bit tentative wading but caught on fast. He lost his fear and began to follow me with no hesitation. (Not unlike a lemming over a cliff.  )     It was a fantastic day on the water and a true pleasure fishing with one of OFC's finest.  'Till next time bud (Maybe in Sioux Lookout?)  Cheers,  Mike"
331201,misfish,2009-04-17 15:47:00,29133,"You fish some great waters SP. Great pics and report.  Ben,s a natural.  Thanks for sharing."
331207,douG,2009-04-17 16:04:00,2693,"Wow, Mike.  Fabulous again.  Maybe next time I will be able to tag along *hack sneeze hack*."
331216,danc,2009-04-17 16:38:00,4677,Ben passed up the Sioux Lookout Steelhead run for this??? I'm guessing that he'll probably miss the blueberry festival too.  Mike. You're the ultimate Steelhead host. One of these days...
331217,solopaddler,2009-04-17 16:47:00,8605," Anytime Dan, anytime....."
331218,MJL,2009-04-17 16:51:00,2427,"Looks like an absolute blast of a trip.  Well done to the both of you.  As for the sucker, I think you might have caught a species of redhorse.  I've only landed 3-4 of them in my life.  Not steel but a great catch nonetheless."
331220,highdrifter,2009-04-17 16:55:00,2534,"Stellar day guys!  Mike, I hope you still got plenty of love to go around!!  swweeeeeett HD"
331221,Steve,2009-04-17 17:06:00,2075,"Ben, YOU MADE IT!  I'm glad I didn't kill ya in the lot before Neil.  It was great to finally meet ya. Ben, myself, and his buddy Jeff held down the lot/tailgate party prior to Neil. It was just us three.  Glad you made it out...at 11:20pm, i thought Neil was just going to play until the next day.  Longest Neil show i've seen out of the 20 plus i've seen.  Cats, Bows, and Neil Young.....what more can ya ask for!"

331243,ben306,2009-04-17 17:57:00,59,"Bit of an amatuer question, but when you say sucker, are they a type of carp cos they dont half look like it? lol"
331244,MJL,2009-04-17 18:07:00,2427, Suckers and carp are part of the same minnow family (cyprinids)...Just think of them as Canadian barbel.LOL
331246,BillM,2009-04-17 18:09:00,17367, Just think of suckers as great muskie bait

331259,kemper,2009-04-17 18:50:00,2232,  Theyre steelheading not purse shopping
331261,MJL,2009-04-17 18:54:00,2427," Steelhead appreciate soft, silky smooth skin too.  Especially in the midst of being violated and touched in some sensitive areas ."
331264,tonyb,2009-04-17 18:56:00,1637,"Good-bye Gold, hello Silver!  Nicely done Ben and kudos to Mike for graciously hosting you for the day.  Hopefully you can return the favour Ben, I'm sure the steelhead would enjoy the break  Tony"
331269,limeyangler,2009-04-17 19:10:00,5204,Awesome Solo....so used to seeing Ben on the ice...it takes a bit of getting used too.  Ben...you lucky dude....lol....good stuff man...really nice fishes there bud.

331287,solopaddler,2009-04-17 20:53:00,8605,"  You guys both made me laugh LOL!  Good eye Victor, although you're only partly right. What I needed was suntan lotion. My cheeks, ears, back of neck and back of hands were burnt to a crisp."
331290,Joeytier,2009-04-17 21:03:00,3990,Another stellar report.  Thanks for sharing.
331308,solopaddler,2009-04-17 22:17:00,8605, Chris if I thought for a second you might be interested in joining you'd have been more than welcome.  Next time!
