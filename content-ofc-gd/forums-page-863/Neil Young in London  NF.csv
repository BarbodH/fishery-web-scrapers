330672,Beats,2009-04-16 03:46:00,543,Anyone else see Neil Young in London tonight?  Just got in and what a great show!  He played for over 2 hours and played All Along The Watchtower as his encore.  Definitely one of the loudest standing ovations I've experienced before he came back out for his last song.  Supposedly he hasn't played here in something like 35 years.

Apparently he was doing a lot of songs never done in concert before.  He performed this tune fore first time in concert. Great campfire type of song. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzTR2AksX0c...PL&index=21
