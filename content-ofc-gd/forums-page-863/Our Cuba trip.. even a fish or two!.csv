330871,TJQ,2009-04-16 20:41:00,7806,"Spent last week in Cuba, our third trip there.. as usual a great time, here some pictures I wanted to share.    It was wierd... the old breast implants were all over the beach... must have washed down from Florida!    This flamingo never left the pond!    Lotsa creatures along the beach.    Some fairly big fish swimming by the pier.      Avery going parasailing... lol.. braver than me!!      Happy to be back!!    The clay man in the restaurant!!     My favorite.. well one of them.. bars!    Finally got to do some fishing on the bridge.. only had an hour though... Moniques got a good story, but I finally outfished her.. and she had the locals helping her!      Avery...    I finally hauled in this monster!!   thay are the toughest things to set the hook on!!    And then I got this one... It SNORTED at me!!    We even had elephants in  our room.    Kids did some Kayaking.    Avery played some volleyball.. I would have but I think I would have stroked out.. its was hot!    We even went out and trolled behind the paddle boat.. chased a stingray for a while, but no luck.    At least the seagulls liked the bait!    We went for a HUGE walk down the beach... then ran in to a local easter party!    This crab attacked Moniques shoe... I think it was incensed by the smell.    The beaches are incredible..    Our family.    Ah the lobster dinner at the lobster shack!    I'm not sure whos more red...Monique or the LOBSTER!!    Some flora!    The pool bar!    Im gonna be a chef!    Some friends we met from Toronto.. Jim & Marylin, He caught two nice snappers... red ones... off the bridge where we  fished form..  He's gonna get me the pictures... he got them back to the resort and they cooked on up.. fantastic.  All in all a great family trip..  I highly recommend Cuba for a family vacation, affordable, safe and you cannot find friendlier people on or off the resort."

331130,Big Cliff,2009-04-17 09:18:00,6899,"Cuba is one of the nicest places I have ever visited but you do want to go 5 star or be prepared for very basic food and drink choices. No matter where you go in Cuba, the people are wonderful.  Where did you stay TJ?"
