They had on show two boats they had done, forgot to ask the Models. One was a 1995 Aluminum and the other was a 1975 Fiberglass. They both looked brand new, with Casting deck, carpet, seat covering, plus hull repairs. Saw some befor/after pics. As I said I WAS impressed! so much so  I said I would mention them on here. Elite Fiberglass & Marine Phone 705-761-91777  I have no affiliation with these young men, and I dont get impressed easily.  Mods , This is not intended as Spam,and hope you dont think so.
