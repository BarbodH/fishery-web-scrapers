331769,ccmtcanada,2009-04-19 03:54:00,7971, PM sent!  Thanks Yellowboat...appreciate the offer!
331514,ccmtcanada,2009-04-18 17:27:00,7971,"We noticed last year that there is a spot where the boat leaks a little bit during an outing.  Nothing major at all, just put a towel down and wring it out every hour or so.  Anyhow, we ripped the carpeting back to take a look and you can see where the boat is dented.  Attached are a few of pictures.      Here's what the rivets look like...they are not loose at all...just wondering if these look ok...there is a picture of the rivet on the underside next....   Here's the dent from the bottom...   So any suggestions on how to fix this up?  Oh Wanye...you busy?? LOL"
331535,irishfield,2009-04-18 18:42:00,26272,"Cliff... you, after the dozens before you, can't seriously be asking this question !  And YES... I >COULD< have fixed it this morning while waiting for a customer to fly in that finally arrived at 11am !"
331538,Tybo,2009-04-18 18:58:00,1373,"Easy peasy. Knock the dent out, Tighten rivets."

331582,Greencoachdog,2009-04-18 21:34:00,8163,I am also kind of surprised you asked this question Cliff!  I would say your best bet would be to take it to Wayne!  Tightening the rivet as Paul said would be the second choice.  There is also this method:    ... and this stuff:  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...rset=ISO-8859-1  and this stuff too!  http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=prod...&lpage=none   ... or you could buy a BRAND NEW BOAT!!!
331584,irishfield,2009-04-18 21:38:00,26272,Thanks Glen... and I can tell you right now this is your problem rivet Cliff..
331585,JohnF,2009-04-18 21:39:00,3494," If it only takes a swipe of a towel to dry it up, why fix??? Rememebr the KISS principle.  JF"
331587,irishfield,2009-04-18 21:43:00,26272,He's not use to house work and Carole makes him do the towel work....

331622,ccmtcanada,2009-04-18 22:59:00,7971,"Hey now Wayne...never read those threads before cause I didn't have a leaky boat then...LOL.  I have no idea what I'm doing, but I can swing a hammer...care to offer some details to this inept boat owner?  Carole said to just take it to you...I say if there's any boat I should try to repair, it's this one...they'll only get more expensive from here. LOL.   Me and fire...not a good combo.  But the brand new boat...that's all I needed to hear!!!  Hey Bly...Glen said we need a new boat...   So I should yell at it and it'll fix itself right???   Yep...   What did I ever do to you? LOL    I'm definitely out of the loop on that one Jeff!!! Please tell!!!"
331626,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-18 23:06:00,260, Ask your wife
331630,irishfield,2009-04-18 23:26:00,26272,See post #2... even I know what she told Jeff! Man are you out of the loop... do you actually live there???

331651,Victor,2009-04-19 00:12:00,1609,"i second the idea of getting a brand new boat, you can just leave this one on my driveway"
331661,Greencoachdog,2009-04-19 00:39:00,8163," ... when are you going to learn Bubba???... life will be so much easier for you if you'll just do what the ""ol ball and chain"" tells you to do!!! ... that goes for JohnnyF too!   You sound like my youngest brother (he's set himself ablaze on several occasions!)  If you're not going to do what your wife tells you to do (dumb, dumb, dumb!!!)... and you can't play with fire, I suggest the Loktite Marine Epoxy.. you can usually find it at Wal-Mart in the boating goods section for less than $10 a tube, I've filled up some screw holes on my boat with it and it's good stuff... PM me if you choose this route!"
331705,misfish,2009-04-19 01:54:00,29133,"Cliff,go for a drive,think about it,and then go buy a new boat.Thats what I would do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,if I wasnt so afraid."
331720,yellowboat,2009-04-19 02:25:00,211,"I could drop bye and have it fix up for you one night this week if you like, just let me know when so I can grab some rivets and B2."
331728,irishfield,2009-04-19 02:44:00,26272,There ya go Cliff... jump at the offer. A man that doesn't fix aluminum boats with goop...    (since I don't consider Sealpak/Chempack/Proseal goop! )
331762,ccmtcanada,2009-04-19 03:45:00,7971," First of all, I do live here I think.  Secondly, I just didn't know WHAT she told Jeff.  I knew she said to take it to you in the first place. LOL.  Third...well, I'm sure there's something, but can't think of it now."
331766,irishfield,2009-04-19 03:46:00,26272,Look up two posts and take yellowboat up on his offer.. he knows what he's doing !
