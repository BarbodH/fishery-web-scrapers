331468,JohnF,2009-04-18 13:03:00,3494," Perhaps, but at least she got her 15 minutes of fame. Now it's up to her what she does with it. If she has the will & the personality to match the talent she might ride it for a while. Ya gotta love rags to riches stories.  JF"
331474,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-18 13:39:00,1362, I'm glad I wasn't the only one that had a tear or two of joy for that wonderful woman!!  Here's a good clip from the Larry King show!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1sJyLkFU_A...player_embedded
331556,JohnF,2009-04-18 20:02:00,3494," All in my family are blessed with a good ear for music. It makes us a pita to have around when folks go off on spontaneous bursts of musical enthusiasm cuz we're critical buttheads. She nails the notes, and can do it a capella which is really hard. Of course I haven't been able to produce the sounds my ear likes for years. My pore old vocal chords are hardened from years of scotch, pipe and cigar smoke, but fortunately they don't affect the hearing. She really does have a nice voice, good range, and a great ear. She could be the next unseen singing star a la the young Chinese girl at the olympics ...or..... she could be the next great character player in movie and stage musicals. I hope she gets a break. She seems like a nice person. I'm glad she's at least getting her kicks for now.  JF"

331660,JohnF,2009-04-19 00:38:00,3494," She can sing like that, and ski too. Awesome.  JF"
331771,jace,2009-04-19 03:58:00,472,"  Potts became a multiplatinum, with album sales in the millions and probably rolls on a carpet of money after his appearance on the show.   Yesterday, there was an article on Forbes.com about Susan Boyle likely being able to do the same in the very near future if she plays her cards right."
331774,holdfast,2009-04-19 04:06:00,1813,"Hopefully she picks a good Agent.  Starting with the She has Talent Show Parasites.  I just have a feeling that right now in Scotland, her phone has not stopped ringing with hopeful wannabee GET RICH agents."
330359,bigfish1965,2009-04-15 15:15:00,3382,This is why American Idol is likely in its last year...they NEVER come up with good stuff like this...
330361,Marko,2009-04-15 15:21:00,854,"Checked that out, prety incredible. Loved the look on Simon`s face when she started to sing, he could not believe it, he was completely stunned."
330363,Beats,2009-04-15 15:25:00,543,That's a great clip.
330380,LeXXington,2009-04-15 16:21:00,1928,Her and Paul Potts would make a great pair... WOW
330385,highdrifter,2009-04-15 16:48:00,2534,"American Idol makes on average 7 million per episode, they're actually the highest grossing TV show this year..  They get 25.6 million viewers on average per episode... That's just insane!  Not that I watch it of course.."
330386,desship,2009-04-15 17:01:00,96,"I was once forced  sit through a Canadian Idol, hopefull , at a safety meeting prior to her audition. She thought she was talented but she wasn't. She didn't make it. The next year she tried again and again. On the other hand Susan Boyle is talented .Have not watched any Idol show since the first year. Cheap entertainment makes a lot of money for networks etc."
330390,John,2009-04-15 17:25:00,2956," I think that the two shows are quite different in their appeal and approach. One is looking for amazing talent in any field of entertainment and the other unfortunately is just a network selling a show, looking for ratings primarily and young, marketable singers that can be signed to contract secondly. Just my .02.......  Pop Idol was the UK show that spawned American Idol and is similar in most respects."
330444,mikeh,2009-04-15 20:46:00,824,Pretty amazing to have that talent and not have nobody notice it before.
330451,misfish,2009-04-15 21:14:00,29133,"NOW THATS MUSIC. Yes there are many types of music out there,but that was great singing.I agree.Where was this women?"
330454,Roy,2009-04-15 21:23:00,13728,"That was just wonderful. I was able to watch it twice and twice, tears of joy welled up for that woman called Susan Boyle."
330461,jace,2009-04-15 21:50:00,472," Yeah,  some of the contestants are so off the charts in singing ability and stage performance that I wonder. I've had this theory the last few seasons that some of the contestants are actually pre-selected, A&R scouted talents who have been planted into the group.    It's excellent promotion and builds a fan base before an album is ever produced.  Not only that, it tests the market for each singer via votes, tv/media, and online postings.   In the process, it even makes  money through the idol show rather than costing money in high-risk spending to promote an unknown.  Unfortunately, this woman could never make it in album sales because music sales are driven by image more than talent, but she could definitley work in  somehting like live stage shows, movie sound tracks, etc."
330466,jace,2009-04-15 22:02:00,472,"I just remembered another foreign Idol who had the same deal.  He was a blonde, funny looking guy and the arrogant english judge kept talking his goofy looks.   I don't recall his name so i can't help you find him but his amazing singing talent crushed his competitors.   He won that, then went on to World Idol where he beat Kelly Clarkson which never gets publicized over here, of course.    All i can remember is he sang  U2's Beautiful Day, Tal Bachman's ""She's so High"", and recorded a remake of ""Stars Go Blue"" in a duet with an established foreign blonde singer."
330467,JohnF,2009-04-15 22:06:00,3494," The problem is that homely talented people are a dime a dozen, as cruel as that sounds. If one doesn't have the looks, they better have huge stage presence and a great sense of humour. The lady on the clip might possibly have enough of a schtick to get a shot. I have no idea of the stats but for every person who makes it to the big time there are hundreds if not thousands with even more talent who never make it. If you heard my brother playing guitar you'd wonder why you'd never heard of him. Fact is every one of you has probably heard him playing at some time in your lives, but I'll bet not one of you know who he is. His problem is that he looks too much like me, only skinny. The entertainment world is a hard cruel place to play.  JF"
330468,JDMITR,2009-04-15 22:10:00,12,That was amazing! Surprised me!
330469,Roy,2009-04-15 22:13:00,13728, I think that was Kurt Nilsen from Norway?
330470,holdfast,2009-04-15 22:13:00,1813,"Wow, she is so amazing.  Actually brought tears of joy for her.  Just Amazing and a feel good story.  Thanks"
330473,jace,2009-04-15 22:17:00,472,"  Carlos Santana, right?  Is your brother a session player ?"
330474,jace,2009-04-15 22:20:00,472,  that's the guy.  Thanks.
330478,JohnF,2009-04-15 22:31:00,3494, Not Santana.  But if you've ever watched Hockey Night in Canada you've heard his guitar. Or the Olympics.  JF
330479,JohnF,2009-04-15 22:32:00,3494,"Oh, and he may be the only person who hasn't been in church in 30 years or so who's played on 100 Huntley St.  JF"
330491,Greencoachdog,2009-04-15 22:50:00,8163,  I have to disagree... look at the Glimmer Twins!
330497,lew,2009-04-15 23:02:00,12766,"I don't watch much television and have never seen any of these new ""Idol"" shows, but if that's the caliber of talent I've been missing, perhaps I should start watching them.  That lovely lady is a joy to listen to !!"
331110,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-17 05:41:00,0,goes to show how the music biz has poisoned peoples mind.  a lady walks out and because she isn't a 20 something skank nobody thinks she can sing.  what reason did the audience have to be cynical?  johnf hit the nail on the head.
331164,gdelongchamp,2009-04-17 13:17:00,199,Not intending to steal the thread but Carlos Santana has been famous for years. He wowed everyone at Woodstock and I was listening to him for years before that.  I was featuring his second album Abraxas in my grade 8 class.  Are you really related to him?  Susan Boyle is now world famous. Hope to hear a lot more of her and she's now on the biggesgt roller coaster of her life and I hope she enjoys every minute of it. And somehow I don't think she'll be taken for a ride or taken advantage of. I think she has savvy.
331185,Weekend Warrior,2009-04-17 14:34:00,27,This really goes to show you just how much talent goes completely unnoticed. This woman could easily have lived the second half of her life without anyone ever knowing what she was capable of.  Makes you wonder just how many examples like this are out there.
