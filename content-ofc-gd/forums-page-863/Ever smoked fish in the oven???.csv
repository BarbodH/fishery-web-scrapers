330740,Joeytier,2009-04-16 13:57:00,3990,What exactly is in the marinade?  I'd like to try this.
330743,Zubris21,2009-04-16 14:04:00,563,"I'd also like to try this.  I was contemplating making a smoker (the one from Outdoor Canada) but it was only a cold smoker, which I found may have had less applications than I wanted, ie smoking ribs, duck, or whatever.  Also when I priced the materials it would have been a bit too expensive for me.  Let us know how this turns out, I am very curious!"
330756,BITEME,2009-04-16 14:33:00,1968,Id try it but not enough room in the oven to get comfortable
330762,rover1.5dx,2009-04-16 14:43:00,23,"Are you actually 'smoking' those fillets are simply slow cooking them?  I'm no expert but you need wood chips and smoke to actually smoke fish.  I smoke fish a couple of times a year.  Most recently a couple of whities from Simcoe.  Started it off on my BBQ/smoker with about 4 hours of slow smoking with soaked maple chips.  It creates a lot of smoke.  WAY too much to be done inside.  The meat was still a bit moist so I finished it off in the oven with the door open at 200F.  Regardless, if it tasted good then that's all the matters.  However, the smokey flavour is best with real smoke.  Alternatively if you don't have a smoker and just use the oven, try a marinade with liquid smoke in it.  I've done that with beef jerky.  Turns out great."
331013,Billy Bob,2009-04-17 01:03:00,5865,"I have a friend that would do this in his house using liquid smoke. When I went over there (days later) I could of swore he had a house fire because of the way it smelled when I walked in. Needless to say he was single........  However, to get real smoke taste you really need to actually smoke the fish...........   Bob"
331058,brkygetr,2009-04-17 02:27:00,425,"ok not smokin.... though I did add liquid smoke..came out too sweet...gonna coat it in HOT sauce to it to nullify the sweet...other than that worked great. 4.5 hours in the oven at 200 with the door cracked. Marinade consisted of brown sugar (too much), soya, hickory marinade (Club House), and the liquid smoke. Girlfriend loves it...I think its too sweet.....  either way its GOOD!"
331278,Billy Bob,2009-04-17 20:01:00,5865,But how does the house smell. YOU might not notice the house fire smell but others definitely do...........
331303,cranks bait,2009-04-17 21:53:00,721, And even harder to keep it lit!
331324,brkygetr,2009-04-17 23:16:00,425, House smells like good ol' cookin'...and beer. LOL No rafters or truses were harmed in the making of this fish.
331370,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-18 01:21:00,270,  better get some heavy`duty   oven cleaner .  lol she's going to curse your name as she cleans it lol
