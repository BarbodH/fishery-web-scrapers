331187,danbouck,2009-04-17 14:42:00,4380,I always use the old cut. Think it's honor system right now
331189,mistaredone,2009-04-17 14:45:00,913,Old cut?
331199,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-17 15:36:00,2050,"no public launches on the bay brother.  10 to 20 bucks depending on where you launch.  Supposed to be a SW wind this weekend so you'll want to launch on the long point end of hte bay rather than the ST. willies side.  cheers, UF"
331205,tinbanger,2009-04-17 16:02:00,1028,"best advice I got with first boat .....  If the public /free launch is questionable ,pay the money and use a good/better launch ( = launching fee) .Avoids some of the hassels , less likely to get stuck , more secure parking. docks etc .  If seen guys stuck on free launchs when there is pay for use one steps away .Bet they wish they had paid the $10/20 !  TB"

We also might just head down to St. Clair... about the same amount of drive for us.  http://www.oldcut.com/  that's the link to the old cut http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&q=274...,%20ON%20Canada is a link to aker's  Hard to say what the wind is going to be, but the inner bay can get a little choppy sometimes.  Last I heard the pike bite was still not on there... but I've got a handful of spots to try tomorrow... have you got a vhf radio on your boat?  Mark"
