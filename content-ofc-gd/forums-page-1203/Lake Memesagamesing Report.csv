80320,mizzmo,2007-06-06 16:33:00,30,"i fished there during that hot spell last week.  may30th until june 2nd.  i caught about ten walleyes, the biggest was 21.5 inches.  had a few nice following pike but they wouldn't hit.  most walleye were caught on pink worm harnesses.  stayed at parolins cottages.  surface temp was 72 degrees in places,  seemed a little high for this time of year. caught millions of rock bass, another sign it may have warmed up already. did see a boat trolling past catch a very nice walleye,  just over 4kgs (8.8lbs) on their scale.  i think it would have been better even if we just had wind. only took a few pictures, nothing to write home about."
