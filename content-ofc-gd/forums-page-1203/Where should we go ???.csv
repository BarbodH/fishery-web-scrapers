My fishing partner wants to target walleye in the Kawarthas (I don't know this area) and I suggested we fish Port Severn or Sparrow Lake for some Pike and maybe a Walleye..  Wind is supposed to be in the 30 km range for the GB area tomorrow.. So we figured to stick to sheltered bays..  Anyone ever fish Clear Lake (Young's Point ) area for Walleye???   I've heard the dam there is a hot spot at night..  Any help PLEASE !!!!  Tiz"
