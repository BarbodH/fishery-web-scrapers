80181,Smokey,2007-06-06 12:05:00,1278,Thanks I hadn't even noticed. It's been a long time in the making. I was chatting with Lew yesterday while fishing and I think we figured I've been around here for almost 5 years now. I think with open water into full swing I'm going to have to turn the post time into more fishing time.  Thanks again Bly
