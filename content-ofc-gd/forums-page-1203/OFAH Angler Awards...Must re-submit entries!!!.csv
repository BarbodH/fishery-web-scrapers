There is a note on the site that said because of email and technical issues, please resubmit anything that you've sent in the past 3 weeks.  They say 3 weeks, but none of my entries are there...and some go back to January of this year.  If you are in the OFC Tourney, be sure to re-submit!!!  Cliff"

80219,RobHall,2007-06-06 13:14:00,261,"That's odd Cliff, because i see all your entries at OFAH. The Carp entries, the Pike entry, etc.  It's all there.  Here's your most recent Carp entry (not the 37 incher)....  http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com/Entry/D...m?EntryID=12398  FOTB "
80222,ccmtcanada,2007-06-06 13:26:00,7971,"LOL...I swear last night none of them were there.  Guess they fixed their site.  When I go to my account however, it says I have no entries...hopefully they can fix that.  Would be a good idea for members to check to make sure though.  Thanks fishinonthebrain!"
80257,taper,2007-06-06 14:41:00,611,Thanks Cliff I was waiting for my reply and had not heard any thing so I went on and checked last night and seen the message you are talking about and tried sending it again.
