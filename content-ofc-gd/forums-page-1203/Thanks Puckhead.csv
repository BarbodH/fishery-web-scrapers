80305,bbog,2007-06-06 16:03:00,665,right on misfish!! let's get this done tonight (sick of Alfie and his antics).
80311,RobHall,2007-06-06 16:09:00,261,I'm a Sens fan that agree's that Alfie actions were of the bonehead variety.  Some fans in Ottawa are even blaming his actions on the game 4 loss.  There is no doubt in my mind this incident gave the Ducks some extra inspiration/motivation.  FOTB 
80312,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-06 16:14:00,1351,go ducks
80316,LipDip,2007-06-06 16:20:00,39,"Trying crappie this wknd and gonna skip the minnows and try crickets. There are tons around right now. OTT fans are pretty quiet, they're all I hear. Still gotta win 4 games though."
80338,Puckhead,2007-06-06 17:07:00,377,hahahaha.... this avatar is free to a good home!

80361,Puckhead,2007-06-06 18:30:00,377,  !!!
80365,jughead,2007-06-06 18:42:00,92,"While it would have been nice to be the best, the Sens will have to settle for being the second best. Not what they wanted but still ahead of 28 other teams provided of course they don't win the next three."
80375,misfish,2007-06-06 18:58:00,29133,  Who let this guy in.    LOL
80383,jughead,2007-06-06 19:07:00,92,It's really not hard to figure out. There are two teams left. The team that loses finishes second. There are thirty teams in the league. Second place is higher than twenty-eight other teams but lower than one other team.
80386,kemper,2007-06-06 19:27:00,2232,"GO DUCKS GO BABY! theyve been makin me money all season, and nobody believed in them. Untill now. SHOW ME THE MONEY!"

80410,xrap,2007-06-06 20:11:00,683,  It's funny when Ottawa sucks and the sens fans have to bring up the leafs evreytime they lose. And when ever leafs do make the playoffs when we play the sens we always sweep you. So why don't you quit chirping because your team sucks. GO DUCKS GO!!!!!!
80417,misfish,2007-06-06 20:24:00,29133,"   If and I say if,the leafs had of made it,the Sens would not be where they are.Thany you very much."
80429,bassmaster4,2007-06-06 20:55:00,801,well said x rap and sens blow alfie is a disgrace to the game hopefully ducks will take the cup tonight
80438,Jigger,2007-06-06 21:21:00,1237,fUNNY HOW I DON'T HEAR A THING FROM THE CHIRPING LEAF FANS UNTIL OTTAWA IS ON THE BRINK OF ELIMINATION HHHMMM.....

Don't know if you're aware but...    Poor deluded Senators fans. Second place is the first loser. GO DUCKS!
80446,misfish,2007-06-06 21:35:00,29133," Blame the game not the playa. I want to see old time hockey back. They only reason for the new rules is because of ALL THE WHINNING OVER SEAS PLAYERS.  If you watch the Sumit game,you will see my point.Thier goalie was thier toughest player.Ask any Canadian born player and they will tell ya,fist in yer face and slash accross the ankles,will make ya a better and tougher player and a more respectful player. Thats what it,s all about. This diving and fake ,OH IM HURT BLOW THE WHISTLE has ruined the game.  Pronger,I think Alfie needs a side order of stick fries and a elbow to go.LOL Enjoy yer summer Ottawa boys.  God I hope Im right,I hate eating crow.L M A O"
80456,fliptheslop,2007-06-06 21:55:00,112,"Jughead just for the record,coming in second just makes you the first LOSER on the list. And Specktackular  NANANABOOBOO"
80463,misfish,2007-06-06 22:26:00,29133,Dont forget the HOO HOO
80479,easton13th,2007-06-06 22:51:00,371,Peter Puck! That was great to see that again!  Easton
80481,jughead,2007-06-06 22:56:00,92,"Well actually, coming in second would make you the last loser. The first loser would be the first team eliminated from the playoffs. It would then count down successively based on mathematical elimination from the playoffs and finally arriving at the team which plays for the Cup but does not win it.  Simple logic dictates that the team who loses the cup is the 29th loser."
80482,misfish,2007-06-06 22:58:00,29133," Ah I thought I was the only old guy here.LOL Remember show down Easton?  Just to add to my comment regaurds to old time hockey and the way it was played,the leafs would of gave the smash mouth style way before this and would of put them out of thier misury and saved them the embare,ass,ment.  Go figure Yashin just went for 17,000,000. WHAT EVER. Tucker must be worth  a few billion then."
