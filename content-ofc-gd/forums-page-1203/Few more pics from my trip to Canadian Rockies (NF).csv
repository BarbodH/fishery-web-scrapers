80358,keram,2007-06-06 18:25:00,585,"Getting there:   From Calgary's downtown     Trans Canada Highway      Couple  more scenery shots        Maligne Lake, the jewel of Canadian Rockies, still frozen so we have to go again for a boat tour    Another frozen lake with few avalanches in the background     Athabasca glacier area. The snow cap  ( center of the picture ) can deposit it's water to Atlantic, Pacific or Arctic  ocean .    Wildlife crossing. Yup, it is exactly what I've said. About 30m long, looks like a bridge, designed for safe passage for animals over the highway ( quite few of them in Banff NP )     Another look from one of the hiking trails in Canmore area    Glad I could share my experience with you. Hope you've enjoyed the picures. Bottom line is : If you have a chance, go there!!!!!, being there is sooooooooo much better then seeing it on the monitor screen"
