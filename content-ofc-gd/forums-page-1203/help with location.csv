Lately I have been taking the kids down fishing in town here with limited results. What I was wondering is what the fishing is like in Bronte this time of year and what you can catch. I go there alot in the fall but have never tried this time of year. I am wondering if there would be enough there to keep kids interested and at the same time have the chance for something bigger(carp,trout,etc.). We would have to shore fish and do not mind walking. I just want to keep getting these guys out and also keep me happy too. Any thoughts would be great. Also want to get them down to Dunnville so hopefully will be posting our adventures soon. Anyway, thanks in advance."
