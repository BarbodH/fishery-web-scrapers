79661,irishfield,2007-06-05 15:00:00,26272," Peter...now that I've looked at the pics a few times I realize what a dang mess my shop is. Guess I need to clean it up....in oh say November, as for now... I'm goin fishin!  Shop is seperate from the hangar. Cuts on total loss from when I screw up with the torch...  If anyone else finds themselves in this situation...I have a couple feet of the composite shaft left over.   And Tonyb...I've been workin on a name for the boat. That one might give the ladies the wrong idea....  Kicking ""ONE FOOT 'EYE TEASE"" around right now......"
