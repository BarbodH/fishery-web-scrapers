We'd be coming from Ohio, so we want to be sure it's worth our while. We were last there in 1996, and fishing for pike, smallies and 'eyes was pretty decent at that time.  For anyone that has recent experience there or has heard some feedback on this lake, how would you characterize the walleye fishing there as compared to, say, 10 years ago?  Thanks for the info!"

It's catching the smart ones that will put your knowledge and experience to the test, and there are plenty of smart ones  Honestly, I haven't fishing Nosbonsing, but everything I have ever heard about it was that there was great opportunity for Musky there, and they like to eat Walleye soo..I'd say there is probably a decent Walleye population...  Hopefully someone can offer first-hand experience and advice.  Tony"

Sure you'll get your walleye here and there, but your best bet up that way is Nippissing for sure IMO. What works? Go simple IMO. 1/4 oz jig heads, vary the colours, tip with white or green powergrubs and a minnow. Work your boat over the humps and around the weed edges in the morning and evening hours drifting and you should do all right. Check out McConnell & Shields point and the narrows, you may get into some eyes.  Lots of perch as well!! Good Luck wherever you go.  FOTB "
80333,Bernie,2007-06-06 16:55:00,3190,If you are travelling all this way Nipissing is the better lake by far. Nosbonsing isnt too far(about6-8 Miles) from Callander Bay so if you want to try both set up your stay in Callander and trailer over to Nosbonsing for a day trip.
