79176,aplumma,2007-06-04 19:53:00,6896,nice fish thanks for putting her back in the water. Fish that size deserve to go forth and multiply.   Art
79177,mattyk,2007-06-04 19:54:00,2110,nice catfish!
79273,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-04 23:02:00,0,WOW! What a monster! Any details to how you caught it and what area of North America?
79312,easton13th,2007-06-04 23:41:00,371,Nice catch and release.  Easton
79353,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-05 00:43:00,1183,No kidding that's a biggie!!  Would be interesting to track...meaning how many times that monster has been caught and released.
79356,Daplumma,2007-06-05 00:47:00,1961,Very nice kitty there.Thanx for letting someone else have a crack at it.A few pounds less and you are talkin bout some good chow! Joe
79364,ccmtcanada,2007-06-05 00:58:00,7971,"Wow...that's some monster you got there!! Good job!  People call the carp I call ugly...well, that one rivals my carp...LOL."
79373,GbayGiant,2007-06-05 01:05:00,1780,"That's a fatty, nice job. You got a pic of your dads to show us ? That's a nasty lamprey mark, wonder if it will live."
79457,silvio,2007-06-05 02:25:00,433,Hey guys thanks for the comment by the way the pic of the release is a bow not the cat but the cat was released also no point in keeping a fish that size. As for the scar caused by the lamprey it will live most likely. My dad has a pic of his fish on his cell but I do not have the USB if I get one I will post it. As for location it is not a secret but I prefer not to say I will say the trib comes of g bay. Have a good one boys. Anyone wants to give a rough estimate about the weight.

79820,wallyboss,2007-06-05 18:59:00,1095,I would say close to 11 lbs  But picture is pretty dark.  I caught my PB catfish this year at 12lbs 11oz and it seemed to be a bit bigger than that one.  
79824,silvio,2007-06-05 19:09:00,433,Wally boss my fish was the same length more or less but alot fatter much fatter. That pic of mine you staring at just the belly there still the side and stuff. I would say the fish was maybe 13-15 pounds. I could be wrong.
