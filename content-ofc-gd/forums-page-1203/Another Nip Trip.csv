79668,Bernie,2007-06-05 15:20:00,3190,Love that report Blaque. Thats my neck of the woods. We likely crossed paths a couple times over the weekend.
79758,blaque,2007-06-05 17:15:00,2419," Ill bet, i was all over that bay for a week lol. LOVE riding around all those nooks and crannies. Like a little maze in there. Im used to fishing in water with alot less character, You can stand up, do a 360 and you've pretty much seen the shoreline of the lake. Not there, every boat ride was different, something new around every corner.......most nights when the fishin was done and the sun was just about set, I mixed up a Vodka and Tea on board and rode the Minn Kota back to camp nice and slow to take it all in. Very Nice.  THanks for the kind responses guys. You guys who inhabit these areas are extremely lucky. Count your blessings"
79834,blaque,2007-06-05 19:30:00,2419, Were you the guy in the Legend lol (j/k) Man are those boats popular up there in Canader.
79855,Handlebarz,2007-06-05 20:10:00,3790,nice report and pics just remind me not to hire your camera man they missed alot of head shots. I have a couple like that that I have taken over the years
79874,blaque,2007-06-05 20:59:00,2419," I see the people in the pics everyday........one of them in the mirror every morning.........the fish on the other hand, Ill never see them again. Along with the scenery, a human is the  last thing i want in a scenery shot  lol !"
79890,Bernie,2007-06-05 21:29:00,3190, Hi again Blaque. I run an 18.5 Seaswirl with a 175 Evinrude. Just look for the roostertail.

80056,Northhunter,2007-06-06 01:23:00,214,Awesome report! Nice shots.  Good to see you did well.
79138,blaque,2007-06-04 19:03:00,2419,"Welp, Im back from my week in Nippissing in the South Bay area. Alot of preperation payed off. The vehicles ran great, the boat performed flawlessly all week, got there without getting lost. Cant ask for much more than that lol.  As a bonus, we did well all week on the walleyes. We started out fishing the shallow weedy waters in teh 4-8 ft. range with deerhair jigs tipped with the worm, but couldnt find a fish for the first few hours in the morning........we decided to check some deeper waters and see if we could mark some fish. Walah. One of the first drops we found from 12ish into 25ish depths......we marked a bunch of fish. Most of them on the flat after the drop. We pretty much stayed on these fish with success for a morning or two trolling harnesses real slow before we tried to find some bigger fish. We found some bigger archs in a little deeper water, but they were scattered to say the least, and dont even know if they were eyes. We tried drifting some jigheads tipped....but came up empty on those bigger fish.  Soooo, back to our original spot, we got a few in the slot (17-19""). And continued to catch them fairly consistantly using bottom bouncers (3/4 oz.) and floating harnesses in an orange /chartruese/ w. black bead combo. Didnt have to switch it up from that all week as we thought it hit the spot for the eyes. Just for a change of pace we would drift some jigs because i do enjoy that style......but we were doing better covering more water with the electric. Had alot of perch nippin at the harnesses, but you could def. tell the bite and if ya wanted to, you could snatch it away from them. But we did end up gettin a couple good eater perch.  All in all, it was one of the best trips weve had in a while. Havent been up  there in years, south bay is a beautiful area. Forgot just how big that lake is!!

79157,fishnsled,2007-06-04 19:24:00,3520,EXCELLENT REPORT!!!!!    Thanks for sharing!
79169,blaque,2007-06-04 19:39:00,2419,"Thanks Boys........I knew Id get ya with that forkfull of fish lol. I would also add that we did have 3 or 4 spots that were producing pretty well, it seemed as if you would go pick up some fish real quick, and they would shut down within an hour or so. Move to the next area, pick up some fish in the first hour (give or take) and have to find some more willing biters by taking a short boat ride. Saw two bigger fish caught also, one at camp that was ""6 lbs"" and ""29 inches"". Saw that one from a distance on the stringer. And I watched a guy net one casting stickbaits in shallower water out on the water that he shouted ""7 lbs 29-1/2 inches"" when i asked him how big. Very large fish in comparison to the majority of the fish I saw. Not as good on the taste buds though lol"
