Being fair skinned and red headed, I can get a nasty burn in about 10 minutes. I always wear long sleeved shirts, full legged pants, socks and shoes and even a hood if the sun is really bad. I even used to wear gloves before sunscreen came along. I'd rather sweat than burn, and I can't stand putting any kind of lotion on myself. I'd rather burn to death than slather any type of lotion on me. Weird, huh? But it works for me."
80104,MJL,2007-06-06 03:01:00,2427,"I guess I'm lucky I don't burn.  I just tan or look like a cooked lobster at the end of the day without protection.  Even so I take sun protection very seriously.  The sunscreen that Kevin posted (Ombrelle) is my favourite in 30-45.  It's light enough that you don't even know you're wearing it. I apply it to all exposed areas (feet included).  I also wear light long-sleeved breathable shirts I picked up at MEC for around $20, a hat with flaps made by Eddie Bauer and a set polarized glasses for eye protection.    Whatever keeps you fishing longer can't be a bad thing."

80138,fishnsled,2007-06-06 04:15:00,3520,"I had my sunscreen with me just put it on a little too late.  My burn wasn't too bad but enough of a reminder not to do it again, until the next time.  I've been pretty good this year in putting it on before I leave the house.  Now I know why, once your out on the water your mind is on other things.    Speedy recovery to all!"
79785,douG,2007-06-05 17:46:00,2693,"Of course it would be half as bad, o little one."
79787,irishfield,2007-06-05 17:49:00,26272,"  Yah...but we don't all look as good as you, in Tilley, Douglas !  Maybe I'll dig out the old sumbraro(sp?) that I have around here somewhere....  Roy...you've always got a better angle on things..."
79796,snag,2007-06-05 18:16:00,1932,"Hey Brian,  As I'm sure your doctor told you, After a burn like that you can never have another due to the increase in cancer risk.   Not sexy, but it works for me:  "
