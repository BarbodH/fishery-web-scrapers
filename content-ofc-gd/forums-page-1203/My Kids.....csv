My oldest (Evan - 4) went fishing Monday at the baby sitter's, and called me at work so excited he caught two ""HUGE"" fish.  After I saw the pictures, I agreed:       And then there is Joah.....he's 22 months.  He put on this helment a few weeks ago, and luck would have it, I had the video camera ready - make sure the sound is up so you can hear him grunt!!.  Now that we've got DSL in the new-to-us home, I can upload for all to share!  Kids are so much fun....and I've got boy #3 coming any day now!!  "
