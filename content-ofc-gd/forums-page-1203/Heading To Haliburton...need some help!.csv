80232,ccmtcanada,2007-06-06 13:46:00,7971,"My oldest daughter is at a camp in the Haliburton area and it's parent's day this coming Saturday.  The weather is looking pretty good and since our 5 year old loves to fish, we thought we'd make a mini fishing trip out of it for her.  The camp is in the hwy 35 and hwy 118 area so any lake along the way would be great.  We'd be looking for shore spots, with hopefully lots of panfish so our little one isn't too bored.  Some bigger fish would be great too for when bly and I have a chance to cast out a little.  Any suggestions would be great...not looking for secret spots, just a spot for the little one to pull in some fish.  PM if you dont want to post details on the board please.  Looking at a map, it looks like we'll be passing the following lakes....  West side of Sturgeon Lake Between Balsam and Cameron Lake...across the Trent Canal Shadow Lake Gull Lake Twelve Mile Lake Boshkung Lake  Thanks everyone!!!"
80240,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-06 13:52:00,1351,panfish?? just get some worms and you're set.. panfish are everywhere!
80284,Joey,2007-06-06 15:20:00,9122,Try Gull lake down by Miners Bay.  There's even a beach there right off the highway so she can go swimming if she gets bored.  I've personally never fished there (I've fished the big part of the lake from a boat) but Paul's nephew has and has caught fish.  Good luck  Joey

I don't know any of the lakes you mentioned so I'm of no help to you.  Have fun.  Maureen"
80339,Nemo,2007-06-06 17:23:00,727,Hit the Bait Shop on the west side of 35 just across from the Kawartha Dairy. Ask there about panfish and pick up some worms. You will then have to go to the Kawartha Dairy and sample some treats  There lots of good places to hit north of H'burton before 118.
80342,Badger Shark,2007-06-06 17:30:00,291,"I think if the fish know your coming they will just show up for you as it seems you guys are fish magnets!  I think its great you guys get out so often together, I am just as lucky as you Cliff in the fact my wife likes to fish when ever she can get the chance and never gives me grief about going.  Only thing is she still wont hold the fish yet.  Have a good time and good luck, looking forward to your report as usual."
80588,ccmtcanada,2007-06-07 03:03:00,7971,"Thanks everyone....as well as those who PMd me some options (victor, joey and fishnsled).  Hopefully we'll have a nice report for when we return on Saturday evening!!!"
