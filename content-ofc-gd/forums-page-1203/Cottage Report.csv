Anthony, myself and our dad left Aylmer Friday morning at around 11 and arrived at out cottage about an hour and a half later. As soon as we opened up the place, a few major problems caught our attention. The pressure in the waterline showed that we had a leak somewhere, and because the line is underground, we feared the worst. Turned out there was a huge crack in it that needs some repairing next weekend. No water for the entire weekend made things a bit more difficult to do a few smaller things.    The weatherman called for cloudy skies, rain and thunderstorms for most part of the weekend. The front brought in lot's of warm air, humid days, lightning storms, and a bit of rain. Friday night we took it easy and prepared the boats for a couple days of hard fishing. After having motor problems at the end of the season last year, we were anxious to see how they were running after bringing them into the shop over the winter. Few pulls of the cord and both started up right away and suprisingly running very smooth. After supper that night we took it easy and passed out quite early. I hoped for the rain to stop by the morning so we could stop by the camp and  chat with some hawkers for a bit before heading out..  First night was rainy and foggy. Not enjoyable when you favorite walleye spot is a good little boot down the river. Oh well, were ready for the morning   Talk about being in the bush. You could not walk 10 feet through here without being eatin' alive by mosquitos and black flies.   Dad giving the small boat a first run.   Saturday morning we awoke to the smell of bacon and eggs that dad had ready for us. The meal went down quick and anticipation to get out on the water was high. The weather was cloudy and humid. The river, calm as glass. Our breaky went down quick with high anticipation to get out on the river. After bailing out both boats and rigging a few rods, we were off to Laurention View to see of the boys were up and ready to get out. As we got to the lodge, no one was in sight. Everyone must have been out fishing so we booted back to the Black River to make our first few runs. We were looking for walleye and decided to try bottom bouncing and jigging as our first approach. For jigging we used white twistertails. The pattern of the jig head did not seem to matter. While slowly bouncing along the first break, were into our first few batches of walleye/sauger. We had our limits quick but still did not have the size. Good eating I tell ya.  Anthony with a nice sauger   Andrew followed up with one not too long after(How could someone be so tired with all that action)     Dad signaled us on the walkie talkies not to long after saying he had caught a big fish trolling. He needed a net and tools to release him quickly and off we were to give him a hand. Both of us looked at each other and laughed thinking the fish he had caught was no bigger than 5lbs LOL. The laughing stopped as we got closer to the boat. First thing I had noticed was the big back a northern swaying slowly in the water. Getting the hooks out was easy, reviving it took a bit longer. 14 lbs of pike! Sign of good things to come. Ended up being the biggest fish 'Caught' this weekend.  Beauty Dad!   We also encounterd many beautiful sights and wildlife that day and today. Thought I would share a few pictures..  Big Toad   Basking Turtle   Swimming deer   Eagles nest   Seeing as though bottom bouncers were a hit a few hours earlier in the day, we decided to try the technique again in a little bay that we have caught many walleye in before. Staying shallow and in the weeds Anthony caught the first one..then a double header. They are there. We caught out limits again and called it a night..Sens were playing. No missing the game   What more could you ask for, Sens on the radio, walleye in the boat.        Few Scenic pictures of the areas we were fishing       The night ended perfect and the Sens won..Wahoo. It started to rain a little after dark so a camp fire was out of the question..Sunday we took another run up to the resort to see of we could find the guys this time. They were not too far.  Shot of the resort   BTS and his partner in one boat, Hitmanhill and the others in the other. Nice new rig. Didn't want to bother them too much. Glad to hear the walleye were biting for them and a fish fry was had.     Can't wait until next weekend  -Andrew"
