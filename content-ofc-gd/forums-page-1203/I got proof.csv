78634,Deano,2007-06-03 12:13:00,767,"Was out and about today and remembered this time about the sign. Thought I'd get a pic of it. Who else has a pic with them and the ""SIGN""?    "
78636,Terry,2007-06-03 12:20:00,14456,I remember when we all hung around that website...ontariofishing.net  now we are at ofncommunity.com....ah the good old days
78685,irishfield,2007-06-03 13:45:00,26272,I bet ya TJ painted the first sheet and Monique the other three!!
78687,Gerritt,2007-06-03 13:47:00,6129,Yup that sign has defiantly seen better days!  Gerritt.
80179,Spiel,2007-06-06 12:02:00,9065,....I've actually seen it but alas never touched it or photographed it.  *hangs head in shame*
80205,RobHall,2007-06-06 12:55:00,261,"I'll be driving past that sign in about 3 weeks, on my way to the French River.  I'll be sure to snap a pic of me and the sign.  Only 23 more sleeps and i'll be    for a week.  FOTB "
80302,taper,2007-06-06 15:58:00,611,"Where is it located, I go to the French river every year and have never seen it."
80307,RobHall,2007-06-06 16:03:00,261," If memory serves me correctly it is between Northbay and the Highway 64 turnoff to go south towards the west arm and the french river.  I live in Ottawa, so the best route for me is highway 17 to highway 64.  If you live in western ontario...you would never pass the sign going to the French River.  FOTB "
80308,fishnsled,2007-06-06 16:07:00,3520,Good one Wayne!
