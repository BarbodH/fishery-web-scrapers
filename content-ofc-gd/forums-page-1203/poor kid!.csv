80400,bowshep,2007-06-06 19:54:00,378,Field Goal   Peace Ken   lol
80405,Terry,2007-06-06 19:56:00,14456,god did the poor thing live
80406,1leggedangler,2007-06-06 19:59:00,364,Where were the parents!! Unreal. That guy was moving pretty quick.
80421,irishfield,2007-06-06 20:30:00,26272,I see no humour in that at all...
80443,ccmtcanada,2007-06-06 21:30:00,7971, Agreed....I kept imagining my own child...and being horrified at the situation.
80451,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-06 21:43:00,1351,note: you will see the humour in it from the sound effects (need speakers on)... the situation itself is not funny.. just with the sound effects.
80471,marvin,2007-06-06 22:36:00,37,WOW!
80480,misfish,2007-06-06 22:51:00,29133,What is funny about that???????????????????????????????? I think the better video would of been the care of the child after the hit.
80483,Terry,2007-06-06 22:58:00,14456,"my speakers were on and loud...  but, then again  I was one who didn't find most of the America's funniest home videos, very funny    and I think I have a well developed sense of humour so why did the chicken cross the road"
80485,misfish,2007-06-06 23:04:00,29133,"I HEAR the humor,,video game graphic, but not the fun of getting smacked up side TO the head of a young child.  BTW WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD."
80488,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-06 23:10:00,1183,Sounds effects or not...poor little one - definitely no humour in that.
80516,mepps,2007-06-07 00:49:00,1301,I didnt see THAT coming!
80580,bassman,2007-06-07 02:49:00,384,The kid wasn't hurt. I thought it was hilarious.  Hopefully you will see some humor in this one:  http://www.break.com/index/sheep-wearing-s...cares-herd.html
