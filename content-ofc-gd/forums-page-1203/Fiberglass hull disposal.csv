80346,Baptiste,2007-06-06 17:41:00,37,"I threw my infamous blue 'speedboat' on my trailer and brought it to the dump at Baptiste...Left it right where they told me to. When I came back with more junk 20 mins. later it was gone. If anybody loses a prop near Bancroft, disreguard the numbers on the side of that blue submarine."
80356,mdej,2007-06-06 18:24:00,98,"1) Tow to middle of lake in deep spot 2) Take 30/30 and shoot 1 hole in the front, 1 in the back 3) Watch it fill with water 4) Mark location on Map (GPS) 5) In a couple weeks go back and fish.  Well, at least thats how my dad got rid of ours when I was a kid.  Really not sure how you go about it now."
