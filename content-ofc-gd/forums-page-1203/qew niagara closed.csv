80331,huey graphite,2007-06-06 16:51:00,362,I was just getting on the hiway Toronto bound at 6am and saw the rollover of a minivan in the ditch going Niagara bound. Appeared to be 2 people standing and 2 or more lying in the ditch ( keep in mind I was going 100km/h). There was no one else on the seen yet. It must have just happened. I calledd 911 and asked for the OPP. They said they were already on the way. Sure enough approaching the skyway I saw 4 OPP cars speeding to the scene in the opposite direction.  Hope it wasn't too serious. I can't understand why there have been so many accidents and closures over the past month. More than there was all winter long.

Apparently a tire blew out and it crossed through all 3 lanes and then flipped. The driver was airlifted to Ham Gen and the front passenger was taken by ambulance, apparently everyone else was not seriously injured.  I'll say this though, it was the same type of van with the same company logo of the van that cut me off twice last night on the way home along that way. The driver this morning was female and the driver that cut me off was male last night, so I guess its not the same person driving. Either way, whoever owns that company needs to speak to their employees about some wreckless driving. It almost cost them today.  cd."
