80604,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-07 03:58:00,2585,the ducks just proved to be to much for the sens.  Congrats to the ducks on a great season and a great playoff run.  For those of you that know the giguere story with his newborn you had to get chills down your spine when you saw him skating around with the little one.  Cheers!

The ducks were just to much for the Sens but I do give the sens credit for getting that far and everyone may hate Alfredson but her is the reason  they got that far, he definitely was not the same old alfredson."

80682,nuke,2007-06-07 12:37:00,60,"I kind of regret cheering for the Ducks in the Detroit series.  I trully thought that Aneheim would be the easiest team to beat for Lord Stanley. Oh well, I'm still proud of the team from our great nation's capital, and congratulations are now in order for the Mighty Ducks.  They proved themselves to be the best.  Mike"
80683,solopaddler,2007-06-07 12:45:00,8605," Was that a Freudian slip or did you mean to say that?  I have to admit I felt bad for the Sen's and their fans last night, that was painful to watch. Congrat's to Anaheim, they're a heckuva team..."
80686,Stoty,2007-06-07 12:51:00,2910,"Yet again, the Senators choke in the playoffs.   But on a positive note.... congratulations to Chris Phillips for scoring his 1st Stanley Cup winning goal........ (just too bad it was on his own net)."
