On Saturday I managed to remember it and the fishing was still pretty good.  I was hoping to meet up with a couple of my buddies but their brown bottled friends were way to kind to them on Friday night.    Needless to say I fished alone but still had a good time.  Started off the day looking for some eyes and found 1 12incher and 2 small muskies.  One about 1.5 pounds and the other around 3-4 pounds.   I changed locations and started looking for muskies trolling around to cover some water quickly.  I was watching the finder and marked a ton of hooks on the screen.  I punched in the spot on the GPS and finished off the weedline I was working.  The decision was whether I should continue to troll or go back and see if the hooks were still around.  Compromise was the solution, troll back and then cast around the spot.  Nothing on the troll but more eyes on the spot. Managed 3 more here, one cigar and 2 nice ones.  A couple of OOS bass as well that never left the water.  Tried for the muskie a few more hours without any luck.   A good day none the less and no hangover for this guy to have to deal with.    LOL!  Here's a couple of pics.       Some nasty wounds on this one.  Same fish in the about pic.     "
80120,ccmtcanada,2007-06-06 03:19:00,7971,Great report!!! Glad to hear that the camera wasn't a jinx.  I wish I fished more during the day...pictures turn out so much better...that walleye in the water shot was really cool.  Looked like you had a great day out there...and worked hard for the fish you did get
80204,Terry,2007-06-06 12:49:00,14456,good report nasty weird looking wound on that fish
80207,caper,2007-06-06 12:56:00,210,"Nice going, thanks for sharing...Always nicer to be on the water than to be nursing a hangover! Although I can't say i've never been there...."
80213,Joey,2007-06-06 13:05:00,9122,"Well I'm glad the camera was not a jinx.  Those are some pretty nasty wounds as you say on that fish, and pretty fresh too.  Wonder what caused them.  Looks like a prop almost.  Great report and I'll tell ya, I don't miss hangovers one little bit either.  Joey"
80228,kennyman,2007-06-06 13:38:00,737,I think he (fishnsled) was hungry. Looks like two bites to me LOL. Sushi ??? I would wait until I got home at least and cooked him up   .
80248,Fishnfiend,2007-06-06 14:15:00,357,Those wounds almost look like someone used a boca grip VERY incorrectly...
80378,TJQ,2007-06-06 19:02:00,7806,Great Report!!
80385,fishnsled,2007-06-06 19:19:00,3520,"Those were some nasty wounds and no I didn't take a couple of bites there Kennyman.  lol  I'm not a big fan of sushi.  I don't think it was another fish, maybe a prop or some kind of fish grabber.  I forgot to mention that all fish were released, got to keep the fish gods happy.    I think most of us have had to battle the curse of a hangover at one time or another Caper.  I'm finding as I get older this body of mine just can't rebound like it use to.    I must be getting old.....lol"
80390,Headhunter,2007-06-06 19:38:00,5703,"I knew it wasn't the camera jinxin yah... it was that little FishnSled voodoo doll I had made up! I didn't know you were going out this weekend past, or I would have engaged it's magic! Nice report and pics bud! HH"
