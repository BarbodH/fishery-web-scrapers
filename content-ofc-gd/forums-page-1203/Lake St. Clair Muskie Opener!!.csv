80524,GbayGiant,2007-06-07 01:07:00,1780,"A nice brute, I always like seeing St Clair muskies they have origional markings. I could have told you were they were from without knowing, lol."
80527,Rich Clemens,2007-06-07 01:17:00,3131,Now that's the pics I've been waiting to see.   Attaboy Patches.
80570,Zib,2007-06-07 02:27:00,369, Most musky in St. Clair are Great Lakes (spotted) Muskellunge were as musky in the Kawarthas are Northern Muskellunge. The cross between the 2 look really cool.
80594,GbayGiant,2007-06-07 03:20:00,1780,"Yep, lot's of good ones, I only get to see the ugly GB ones that are almost white or dark green but they always got big red eyes.  never see any spotted ones on the bay."
