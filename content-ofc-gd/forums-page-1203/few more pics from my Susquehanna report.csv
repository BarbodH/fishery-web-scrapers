79648,setomonkey,2007-06-05 14:44:00,872,"I posted about my smallmouth bass trip on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania a few weeks ago. The guide sent me a few pics that he took with his camera (much better than my digital).  Here's a repeat of the first fish of the morning, as you can see his camera does a much better job...  guide's camera   my camera  Here's a couple more of the many bass I caught that day...   no idea why I'm grimacing, I was having fun!   Hot lure of the day was a white spinnerbait.  Mike"
