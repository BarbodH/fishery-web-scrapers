79280,Joey,2007-06-04 23:21:00,9122,"Paul and I finally picked the right day to go to Lake Ontario, it wasn't raining, it wasn't freezing, there was no lightening and we didn't have any family obligations, so off to Bronte we went.  After forgetting the lifejackets in the garage and a 30 minute detour back to get them, we made it onto the water at Bronte for close to 9 a.m.  What a beautiful day.  It was very smoggy tho and I'm glad we had the GPS unit with us.  We headed out to the depth of water we were told to fish at and put out our 4 lines and waited.  It was HOT, and I'm kind of glad it was smoggy because I think I would have gotten more of a sunburn than I did if it was clearer out.  We trolled from 9 a.m. to about 2 p.m. with only one hit, which was off as quick as it was on.  Then we were ready to call it a day as I was burnt and we could not find the sunscreen anywhere in the boat.  I had to put my shirt on over my tank top so my shoulders didn't get any worse, and then wham, fish on.  Paul's turn so I got some action shots and, unfortunately, in the excitement and trying to drive the boat while he reeled, I hit the wrong button on the camera somewhere in between him reeling and me netting the fish    So some of the pics are a bit fuzzy, especially the money shot, dang.        The revival before release    Here's a couple scenery shots before we left.  The water looks alot choppier, which I don't think was from any wind, as there really wasn't any more, I think it was just boat traffic at that point.        As we were reeling in to leave, we saw a gar pike swimming about 2 feet from the boat on the surface, that was cool.  While I was waiting for Paul to get the truck I made small talk with a guy hanging out at the dock, and it turns out he was working for the ministry and they had just put Lapricide in the water and took a few sample baby lamprey's for inspection, so I got a pic of them (in his hand of course, ewwwwww).  We chatted about how they used to be really good bait for pickerel, at $1 for 12, but they were illegal to sell now.  Was some pretty interesting stuff.    Then on the way home, I saw an Albino heron, pure white.  Never seen one before and I wish we had stopped for a picture.  I don't know how camoflaged you can be as an albino heron     Paul says maybe the fish think the heron is a big cloud  Anyhow, I'm up next fish on  Cheers,  Joey"
79288,ccmtcanada,2007-06-04 23:27:00,7971,Great report Joey!  So...was that fish there a tourney entry?? LOL.  Those baby lampreys were pretty cool to see.  Like that shot of you in your shirt...with all your sponsors....haha.  Go get that next fish Joey!  I'm sure it will be bigger than Tybo's....LOL
79294,Joey,2007-06-04 23:31:00,9122,"Actually Cliff, it was a tourney entry, until we forgot to take the pic with the sign     Paul says I sabotaged it so he couldn't get inches for his team, I don't know what he's talking about  He gets so hot to get them back in the water and revived its hard enough for me just to take a pic sometimes.  Joey"
79298,ccmtcanada,2007-06-04 23:33:00,7971, Oh sure...you may look all sweet and innocent but I think you have it in you to sabotage a pic or two....LOL.  Congrats again...looked like a fun day out there.

79334,irishfield,2007-06-05 00:26:00,26272,Nice report Joey !! Always good to see you guys out and about.
79357,GbayGiant,2007-06-05 00:48:00,1780,"Very nice fish. EWWWWW ugly, but those lamprey do look like sweet walleye bait, and big ones would be good for pike/musky I imagine.  I love herons, never seen a Albino one that would have been interesting."
79363,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-05 00:56:00,1183,"Great report, quite comical too."

79827,JFR,2007-06-05 19:13:00,498,"Great report Joey, again excellent photos, and a pretty decent salmon.  That size would have been perfect in the smoker or BBQ  thanks for sharing.  John"

79937,PatB,2007-06-05 22:55:00,104,"Nice report, awesome fish. I was out Saturday marked some fish but that was about it. You are right about the day, it was fantastic out there. Heading out again this Saturday."
79943,Smokey,2007-06-05 23:17:00,1278,Great report Joey. Thanks for posting the pics and I do that all the time with my camera. Those switches should be tougher to change.
80099,Joey,2007-06-06 02:53:00,9122," B, that hat is actually a Tilley, and they are darned expensive.  Got him that for his birthday last year.  Did you know they come with a lifetime warranty.  Even if you lose it, you only have to pay half price for a replacement.  As for the shirt, Paul makes fun of it every time I wear it, with Mercer plastered all over the backside and then  ...gasp... Yamaha all over it  Joey"
80129,Carp,2007-06-06 03:43:00,1488,"Glad you two made it out there Jo.  Always a bonus when the fish co-operate.  Paul will just have to get another salmon, bigger than the one you failed to photograph for the tourney. If the next one isn't done right, we're going to really believe you're sabotaging our entries.  Thanks for sharing."
80134,Bly,2007-06-06 03:55:00,1556,Nice report Joey and please tell Paul congrats and the salmon!  Oh and it is fine with me if you want to sabotage that team LOL   Bly
80137,fishnsled,2007-06-06 04:08:00,3520,"Great report! Sun, fun and fish to boot!  Looks like a great day to me.  As for the sunburn, how the healing process.  The pain is pretty much gone from mine    I think there are a few of us that need to remember sunscreen before we head out next time."
