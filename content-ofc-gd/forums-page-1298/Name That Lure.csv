16072,fishindevil,2006-12-25 18:22:00,6254,"well,your gonna need some of the following -manns stretch 20, black/silver,blue/chrome,and dr.death -rapala tail dancers,various colours -offshore planner boards,1 left & 1 right -line counter reels filled with 10lb. test -reef-runners various sizes & colours and thats a basic fishing package that will get you started for trolling down at quinte[glenora ferry],the fish will be at various depths so watch your graph,and your line counter reel and determine how much line you will need out to get your lure down to where they are at wich will be anywhere from 15-50ft,most will be suspended so getting the lure to the right depth,will be key to putting fish in the boat,be careful as that part of the bay can get real nasty real quick,so be safe and good luck......"
