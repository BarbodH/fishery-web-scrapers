I checked the ramps and they are icy and there seems to be a couple of boats that made it out at the Belleville Bridge.  We have a good inch of snow and still coming down alot lighter than it was this morning.  It is already melting so I do not think it will be here to stay.  The bay is very calm right now and looks great for fishing, I would guess that the next few days will be eaqually as good.  All the best for those that are heading this way and be safe.  Best regards, Sam"
