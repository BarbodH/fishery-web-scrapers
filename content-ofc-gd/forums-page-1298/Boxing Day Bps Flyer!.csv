15949,pikehunter,2006-12-25 03:08:00,1659,I never saw the print version of it so I tried to find an online of it. Guess it doesn't exist yet.
15967,nautifish,2006-12-25 03:57:00,1416,Well i was contemplateing on going Boxing day because they have a beautiful dinner ware set with a buck on it forgot the name. Sadley its only a four place setting but i was going too buy two. It seems allmost impossible in canada to buy a six place dinnerware set. Instead you end up with eight because every time i have had to buy two...Grrrr..  ....But not so sure i wanna deal with the crowds on boxing day. I have to head back up that way again next monday to pick up my son up from the airport so maybe i will stop in then and see if they still have any left. Fingers crossed.
