15631,verno,2006-12-24 03:21:00,178,"BOQ is the Bay of Quinte.  Nice report, man I love eating pike."
15634,ccmtcanada,2006-12-24 03:31:00,7971, BOQ= Bay of Quinte.  This map will help you out.  I'd be surprised if anyone made fun of you for that question.....it's a legit question...it took me forever to figure out that GB was Georgian Bay.....

15911,Clampet,2006-12-25 00:27:00,1947," It was interesting in the late 80's and early Nineties. That was b4 the z-bra mussells cleared up the water. Them ole walleyes would come in an stay awhile in the relative (8-12') shallows. I remember 60 fish days.  Lotsa a small (1/4 lb) ones, but there were a few big ones thrown in the mix. It was a different fishery than what it has now become."
