I have had to deal with alot this year and the worst my mom passing away suddenly in March and also my wife's Grandfather in June.  This is the first Christmas without them and it has really been hard.  I would like to thank everyone for their kind words and support through the year.  I can only hope that everyone treasures the time they have with your friends and family.  Create great memories with them that will last a lifetime.  I wish you all a great Christmas and to all a good night.  Blake"
