Never been fishing for them before, but I'm more excited to spend the day on the water with my dad.  We'll take the trip sometime in late April.    Here's the guide we're using:  Mike Hulbert Guide Service    Some other Christmas highlights:  1.  Watching the boys open all their presents  2.  I got lots of cash to use on up coming fishing trips throughout the year  3.  Seeing family from all over    And the warmest thing to happen......my son asked if we could box up some of his older toys so, his words, ""I can give them to boys who don't get many toys.""   Bought a lump to my throat!    Merry Christmas All!  dk"

16154,Whopper,2006-12-26 12:26:00,2174,"Good for you Dustin!  Hulbert is a highly respected musky guide, kinda like Indiana's version of Lew  I tried to make it to Webster this past year, well didn't happen. So many places to fish and so little time.  Sounds like your son is on the right track!  Good Luck to ya!  Whopper"
