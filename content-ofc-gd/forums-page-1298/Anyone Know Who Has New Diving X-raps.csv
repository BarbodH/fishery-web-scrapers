14751,007,2006-12-21 03:46:00,537,"Hey fishindevil.  I was down at Bass Pro last week and bought the deep diving x-raps in perch and silver, but I missed out on the rainbow trout colours. They must be restocking but selling fast each time!  I also picked up some of the new minnow raps - the detail on some of them is amazing plus some have red hooks and bill at the front - they look good and hope they catch me some fish next year or may be this weekend  Hope you find some more soon.  007"

14784,SlowPoke,2006-12-21 10:23:00,2984,"Walmart has them in London... probably 100+ in stock, 7 or 8 patterns for $8.56 I believe. -Brian"

15841,Pinch,2006-12-24 20:38:00,231,"I was at the Wal-Mart in Cobourg yesterday and they had piles of them on display.  I didn't really take notice which colours they had, but there was a lot of different ones.  Cobourg may be a shorter drive for you than BPS."
15886,Dabluz,2006-12-24 22:13:00,701,There are lots of them in the Walmart store in Chicoutimi Quebec too.
