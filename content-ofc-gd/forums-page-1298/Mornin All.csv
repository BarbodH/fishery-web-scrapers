I never understood how they can sleep in I think my daughter has awaken at 8am one year and that was the earliest I will even wake them up if I have to. I dont know what all I got but from the looks of the head of that thumper woodie sticking outta my stocking I think the wife is on the right track. Merry Christmas again everyone
