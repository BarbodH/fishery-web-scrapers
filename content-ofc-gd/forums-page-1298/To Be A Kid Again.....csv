15918,ccmtcanada,2006-12-25 01:17:00,7971,I'd like to extend our best wishes to all this Christmas...and for a happy and healthy new year.  My 4 year old daughter iced some cookies for Santa...then wrote him a letter...then spread reindeer food all over the front walk.  Here are some pictures....the smiles and concentration on her face says it all.  She actually wanted to go to bed early so that Santa would come sooner.  Oh to be a kid again...the excitement....the anticipation.....

15935,Smokey,2006-12-25 02:13:00,1278,I agree ccmt. I was telling the wife the other day there better be something for me from Santa under the tree or all my Christmas dreams will be shattered. I haven't had him miss me once yet.  Enjoy your Christmas with the wee one.  Mike

Now, as time rolls on, it is the grandkids.   We had four of them here this past Friday and got three others coming in later today.  Ahhhhh - the majic of Christmas day."
