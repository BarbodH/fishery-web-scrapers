The picture was taken just now, the residents collect from their visitors and all the proceeds go to the Eastbourne lifeboat crew.    RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institute) lifeboats are crewed by volunteers who turn out at a moments notice in all sorts of weather, lets hope their Christmas and all emergency services wherever they are is a quiet one.  Best wishes to you and of your families from us all, Mick"
