This afternoon went over to our daughters and helped the son in law peak his sat dish as the wind moved it out of position.  Took a walk with Liz, Mark and the grandkids ( Amy my dog too! ) in the bush for a few miles and when we got back took a ride with Mark to the liquor store and M&M meats for snack goodies.  Went to a 6:00 Christmas service with my wife and our daughter Liz showed up with her husband ( Mark ) and two of our grandkids for the family Christmas eve service.  On the way home wife and I picked up some pizza and were going suprise our daughter with an impromptu invite for snacks, but when we pulled in our driveway she had left a note on out garage door to come to her house ( she lives about 600 ft. from us on the lakefront ) for something to eat.  We went brought the pizzas and she provided the Chinese snacks.  Gave the grandkids their presents and helped them play with them and got home around 9:30.  Took Amy for a walk around 10 and were now in for the night."
