I have it on french bread with Lemon and a Little Red Onion  I am also BBQ'ing 2 racks of my favourite Rib Recipe this afternoon.  Rack of Ribs placed on tin foil. Add 2 cloves garlic chopped. Some onion Chopped, freshly ground pepper, some balsamic vinegar, a dash of maple syrup and a pat of butter. Seal em up and cook slow on the barbie. after 30 mins unwrap and finish on the barbie with yer favourite BBQ sauce. Add wodd chips in the smoker for more flavour.  My bud's family is from out East and they shuck a pile of Oysters mmmm good with a dash of lemon Juice and a dot of Tobasco. These go great with some Champagne.  Any other holiday favourites...  Oh Yeah - Merry Christmas to all OFC'ers"

Shrimp, scallops, squid, octopus and a few other goodies in the mix.  - Her home made ravioli are another favourite. - Roasted, stuffed chicken is good too. - Veal Scalopini with mom's special white wine, lemon & butter sauce. Mmmm. - BBQ'd Atlantic Salmon is near and dear to my heart as well. - Dad's homemade BBQ sausage is a family favourite and usually part of most meals at mom and dad's place.  Not a usual Christmas food for us, but I've been BBQing lots of beautiful, tender Black Angus rib eye steaks for guests this year. The quality of the meat can't be compared to anything I've had before. It cost me a small fortune every time I had people over. Think I have to ditch a few friends."
15507,Beans,2006-12-23 21:15:00,3339,I'm not too fond of turkey...I eat it but if I had my druthers I'd rather a nice capon or ham or rare prime rib roast...  Of course it wouldn't be Christmas without some figgy pudding with caramel sauce...and homemade shortbread
15545,Greencoachdog,2006-12-23 22:50:00,8163,"  I'm with you on this one Carp!!!... every once in a while Ol' Yeller and I will treat ourselves to a Black Angus Sirloin or Fillet from the highend grocery store in town, there's really nothing else like it!   As for Christmas food, I usually like to smoke a Long Island Duckling with wild rice, apple, and raisin stuffing... but this year Ol' Yeller is doin' a Beef Wellington... and it just wouldn't be Christmas without a nice Waldorf salad!
