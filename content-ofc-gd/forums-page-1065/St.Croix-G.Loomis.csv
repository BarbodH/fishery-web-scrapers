174386,JustinHoffman,2008-03-21 02:20:00,482,"Hello Sconceptor.  Like Greencoachdog mentioned, if you are looking for a high-quality, high-end and lighter-than-air rod, then check out Kistler. They are just new on the market here in Canada, but have been going steady in the States for 10 years. Four lines of rods to cater to any angler's needs. The new lineup of Helium 2 LTX's are simply incredible....Although Loomis and St. Croix have been at the top for some time now, Kistler definitely needs to be mentioned when talking about Canadian-available rods...  If you have any questions, or are looking for a retailer, just give me a shout. I am the National Pro Staff - Canada Division for the company..  www.kistlerrods.com  Good Fishing,  Justin"
174388,2 tone z71,2008-03-21 02:22:00,1311,"St Croix all the way had both used both love the St Croixs ,but started recently buying Shimano rods again ,St croix is a lil proud of there rods and they are great but not worth the $$$ there asking"
174526,MAzing,2008-03-21 15:19:00,43,"You can't really compare the two, G-Loomis only makes one line of rods and they are the best money can buy.  I hear some complaining about repairs and such etc etc, but if you own a G-Loomis over a St-Croix you cut back your chances of needing repairs twice over.  MA"
174542,corvette1,2008-03-21 16:01:00,1765,lifetime warranty my butt they want 75.00 for each rod plus shipping
174546,eye-tracker,2008-03-21 16:04:00,89,"I think G-Loomis and St. Croix offer the same type of warranty where you send the broken rod back and for a fee the rod is replaced. With the recent down turn in the USA economy I think companies are noticing there is no way you can run a business by replace product over the counter (Wish I could get a new car when it wont start   ). I am sure rod companies could make a rod you could never break - but I would never want to fish with a rod like that.  St. Croix warranty program:  http://www.stcroixrods.com/content.asp?id=14 G-Loomis warranty program: http://www.gloomis.com/publish/content/glo...nformation.html  In my opinion a quality blank made for walleye fishing - not bass fishing - makes all the difference as walleye have very soft mouths and you need a rod that allows a sweeping hook set and a soft fast tip that keeps the rod loaded during the fight, therefore the hook does not fall out of the ripped hole in the walleyes mouth. Also try to stay away from all the MH ML etc. as you can not compare a walleye blank to bass blank or even a salmon blank etc. Many of the companies are now going to power and taper ratings which make it easier to figure out what you need.   -sheldon"
174576,muskymatt,2008-03-21 17:23:00,2608,"I have 3 Loomis and 2 st.croix rods and although I usually reach for the Loomis, the st.croix are very nice and of great quality.  There is just something about the loomis that screams quality and they are so sweet to use.  I would say you can't go wrong with either , it's a matter of feel."
174991,Uncle Buck,2008-03-22 21:45:00,1000,"buy new or be cautious...  i bought a used St. Croix Avid Float rod, and the cork is coming out of the handle.... not 1 or 2 pieces, but all around and along the whole length of the grip...  talked to the guy at the local tackle shop and i'm SOL on it since i'm not the original owner... and even then, it would be did i register the rod etc... blah blah blah...  there's a million excuses they can use..."
174994,trapshooter,2008-03-22 22:14:00,1234,"  One line of rods??  Check again.  High end Loomis are definitely one of the best money can buy though.  I'll admit, I'm biased towards St.Croix.  Their warranty program has been very good to me as well.  I sent my broken rods directly back to the factory with a US $10 bill for return shipping.  No questions asked.  The top of the line blanks from both companies are all amazing rods, no question.  It's Croix's warranty that does it for me.  Things happen on the water, rods break.  If I pay top dollar for a rod with a lifetime warranty, I don't want to pay $85 to have it replaced."
175001,waterwolf,2008-03-22 22:45:00,556,"seems like a high- risk investment  to me . i see a lot of disgruntled owners of high-end rods so far.  i've landed some pretty decent fish on "" medium priced equipment"" .  i know i certainly out-fish  a  couple of friends of mine with their  higher- end equipment so ,,,,, .i guess if you drive a ferrari to the  store , it's more fun than driving there in a ford.  as i slowly  upgrade ,  i take pride in those  purchases knowing that my interest is going to a new  level.    high-end gear is the dessert .,, but let's not forget why we go out for dinner .  st. craw ? one day . hope i 'm not comparing it to my BPS rod that's outstanding  for 1/2 price .  my buddy's st.craw seems to do it for him. that's one nod."
175089,Garry2Rs,2008-03-23 03:52:00,1425,"I own both G.Loomis and St.Croix rods.  G.Loomis is in Mount Hope, just south of Hamilton.  St Croix is in Wisconsin. If you loose a ceramic line guide insert the rod has to go back for repair...for me it's easier to get service in Mt. Hope."
175139,MAzing,2008-03-23 13:20:00,43," I was talking line of quality, St-Croix come in premiere, avid and tournament. 3 different quality for the same rod."
175246,trapshooter,2008-03-23 18:30:00,1234," same how loomis has different lines of quality... IMX, GLX, GL2 etc."
175273,Garry2Rs,2008-03-23 19:23:00,1425,"For me, it's getting harder to justify new G.Loomis and St.Croix rods. In the past, Shimano's best rod, the Compre, was nice, but a bit clunky looking hardware wise. Sort of like a girl in an evening dress and Dr. Marten's In the last couple of years they have introduced the Crucial and Cumara rods and upgraded the Compre. This Fall I was in the market for a new 7 foot baitcaster. I looked at the Mag.Bass line of G.Loomis, but bought a Crucial for half the price."
175291,Moosebunk,2008-03-23 19:53:00,3970,"Bought a Frontier 7 foot M-H spinning rod last year and liked it very much for pike.  I'd use this too for deep water laker jigging if I was ever in the need, and, it pulled a few bass through the slop OK."
175341,muskymike,2008-03-23 22:33:00,772,I would like to see this question as a poll. See what kind of results we would get since there are so many mixed responses.
175356,irishfield,2008-03-23 23:13:00,26272,"This is no different than the GM/Chrysler/Ford debate... someone will tell you Honda is better.  There are many good choices out there and they all have their uses.  When it comes to Muskie....my Compre for trolling, St. Croix Premier for jerk baits, my ""Spiel Special"" Loomis for Bucktails and Petemania Muskie rods for new boat mates to use."
93948,sconceptor,2007-07-14 17:35:00,146,"I've heard some horror stories about Gloomis steelhead rods and repairs.  I'm sure for both companies there's many satisfied and unsatisfied customers.  I do believe in going with a dealer you feel comfortable with.  My local shop isn't very good for service, but they don't do as much business as the city shops.  My local store makes you mall them back and deal with the companies.  I like my K/W shop!  I've had a few repairs done there, and rods sent away.  They've always been good.  It's 2hours away for me, but that's what is normal for living in rural south western ontario.  I won't go save a few bucks on a rod at BPS either, as I doubt their service is as good, and it's a 3hour drive.  I do spend thousands at both BPS and small shops!  I just like that fact that the KW store, takes the rod, sends it off, no questions asked, and gets it fixed or replaced.  One new rod was broken just before a week long trip, and they replaced it with a different rod of the same cost.  They knew they'd be able to get a new rod back for the broken one, and sell it again.  I know you can catch hundreds of walleye with even a hand line, on lots of northern lakes.......but nothing beats a good rod.  Match it with a good reel and good line.  Then being able to feel all the bottom or shake of the lure and fish, is great!  I'll probably head down to K/W in a month and pick up a few rods.  I'll work some OT first, so I've got some extra flow to pay for these.   $500 for a couple of good rods and then I'll be craving a centre pin set up for the fall!!!!!   Bottom bouncing for steelhead was great last year, but I crave a good centre pin, so I can float fish like a champ with the rest of them along the rivers.  Spending money on fishing never ends!?!?!?  A thousand or more a year on gear, fishing trips and maybe 10grand for a better boat in a few years!  I can't wait to win the lottery, or find a rich women to support me!!!!!"
93970,addict,2007-07-14 21:05:00,475,"to rich for my blood,shimano,berkley are good enough for me got a free baitcast rod from bass pro this season its made of im8 graphite and has been performing sweet with my pfluger president baitcaster.ive held both loomis and st croix rods and they sure feel sweet but like i said to pricey for me.i like to use graphite meatstcks all backbone as so i can really rip the lips off those Bandits."
93971,Tacklebuster,2007-07-14 21:06:00,303,"I have 3 gloomis rods, IMX(2) 6.5' one piece, and GLX 7' 2 piece, and they are all excellents rods.  Had to get one serviced a while back, it broke when the fish went under the boat and the rod hit the gunwale.  I brought to them when they were located somewhere around Hamilton, and they replaced it no problem."
94033,Greencoachdog,2007-07-15 01:10:00,8163,"Got money to burn?.. look at these, especially the Helium series: http://www.kistlerrods.com/"

Oppps guess I showed my hand. I would like to get one but I think I want to hold one in my hand before I splurge on that puppy.   Art
174270,wacky tambaqui,2008-03-20 22:11:00,33,St-Croix.  I had a new one become a St-Cry when the tip-top broke off from miss-handling -just when walleye opener was just around the corner  My retailer had a new replacement on time for the weekend and I guess I was lucky this time. It probably depends what kind of retailer you get it from. OTOH I built a protective case for storing and transporting it.
174278,FUSION,2008-03-20 22:19:00,81, Maybe I am miss reading this wrong but are you saying a GLX/IMX graphite is the same as a GL2??? If I miss read this I apologize but if thats what your saying I don't have enough time to begin to tell you were your wrong. Your compareing Apples to Oranges...
174316,salmon,2008-03-20 23:52:00,334, I Believe that Tom (Barracuda) was trying to show how he would ranks the model of rods. The GL2 at the bottom of his list.  Not sure (might want to check) but I think that there is no more Loomis Canada. Maybe wrong but check before you buy a Loomis. Jose
174346,moose72,2008-03-21 00:33:00,28,Not much difference between g-loomis and St.Croix until you need warranty work done. G-loomis gives retailers a problem sending out rods for coverage. Try the avid series (St. Croix) They make a 6'6 walleye rod with fuji guides that has wicked feel. Runs about $130 + lifetime warranty.
174352,Tomcat,2008-03-21 00:42:00,395,I use a TWS66MLF St Croix and a PS60MLF St Croix for walleye jigging. They are are both good rods.
174364,muskymike,2008-03-21 01:42:00,772,"I have 6 st. croix's all are either Avids or Premiers. A few are for Musky the others I use for all purpose. My Avid 6'-6"" is a stellar all purpose rod. They are so light and so sensitive you cant go wrong, if you want to spend the $$$ that is. The warranty is Lifetime on the Avids, and though I have not had any problems with mine, both places where I have purchased have said if they have any problems they will take them back and replace with no questions asked.  I have never used a Loomis, but I have picked them up and thought about it. I was actually pondering gettin' a Loomis Musky Rod but remain undecided.  With either of them you will be more then happy."
