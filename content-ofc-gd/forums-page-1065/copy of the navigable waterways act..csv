I used to have a copy of the waterway trespass act and navigation, but now cant seem to find it. I got it here on OFC, this piece of paper is worth its weight in gold. If anyone has a copy please post it here, I would be most appreciative.  Thanks everyone here and have an awesome weekend."

Just be sure when handing over the copy, you never step out of your boat to hand it to said persons. Always remain on the side of the law and you will enjoy hrs and hrs of fishing unscathed."
