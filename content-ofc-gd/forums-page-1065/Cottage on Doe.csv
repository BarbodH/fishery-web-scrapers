175227,Radnine,2008-03-23 17:38:00,1538,"Hi All! Does anyone by chance know of any private cottages for rent on Doe Lake (Big Doe)? I have looked on the net and found the one near Sprucedale ($1900/week thank you very much, but I am taking my family of three, not my high school football team) and have found the many resorts on Little Doe. Unfortunately (for me) the one that we have stayed at in the past has been sold Any leads would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Jim"

175279,Radnine,2008-03-23 19:32:00,1538, I hear you. That's why it's more the shame that the one I rented for 900.00/week sold. It was a beauty.

Better fishing, and nicer resort. Doug and Susan Pincoe run pickeral lake cottages there. Tell them Matt sent you.  They have a really nice place, and for the area, are reasonably priced. plus better fishing.  Hope this helps"
