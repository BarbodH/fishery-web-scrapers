Spent most of the time fighting ice off the line and guides, and spent the rest of the time with our hands in our pockets warming them up every couple of drifts....All in all we still did good, hit two tribs, went 2 for 5 between the two of us... All fish were released.....Going to head back out east to the spot again in the morning. Waters should be prime..... PM me if you want to meet up   "
