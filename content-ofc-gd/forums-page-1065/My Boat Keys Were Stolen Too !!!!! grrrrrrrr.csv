174666,irishfield,2008-03-21 21:06:00,26272,Did you not have a second set of keys for your new Lund Shawn? I have two complete sets of keys for motor/kicker/glove box/locker storage/etc. One set in boat and one set stashed elsewhere.
174670,Fisherman,2008-03-21 21:43:00,7201,"Take a close look at the rod locker locks, I've seen some that had a small number stamped in on the face, that's the key number.  For the trailer tongue, if it's one of the locks that goes through the locking lever, look underneath, see the 3/4 or 13/16 nut...undo it, the assembly should then come off the top to replace or cut off the lock."
174677,Canuck2fan,2008-03-21 21:48:00,1444,Also keep in mind the thieves might be waiting for you to bring your boat home even if they can't find it now.... If you ever store in the driveway at your house and they go for it but you have the locks replaced that might just make them mad. I would be very observant when you bring it home if you ever do because a mad thief might go vandal in such a situation.

I dropped all my keys in Sturgeon lake one time......my wallet was with them. That sucked too......no keys to get home.....no ID......it took me a while and a few $ to get it all back!!  Hope it all works out bud!  Sinker"
