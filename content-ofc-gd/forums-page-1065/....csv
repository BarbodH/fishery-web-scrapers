174491,Muskieman,2008-03-21 13:33:00,2472,:stretcher:   UNREAL!!
174504,Rich Clemens,2008-03-21 14:21:00,3131,I heard about that on the news yesterday.    What are the chances of something like that happening ?  Freaky way to destroy a happy vacation.  Very sad for the family.
174511,Cory,2008-03-21 14:38:00,170,They are interesting to watch jump.  I was surprised at the height they can get out of the water.
174519,b2kptbo,2008-03-21 15:07:00,1505,OOOH Freaky...
174532,fatherof3,2008-03-21 15:34:00,1769,that's crazy
174539,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-21 15:52:00,2585,that is awful!
174552,Ramble,2008-03-21 16:28:00,713,that's not a sting ray it's an eagle ray....no it's more like a manta ray than a sting ray.  But that still is a rough way to check out.
174556,maybe,2008-03-21 16:32:00,307,"!?!?!?!  These things can...and do...jump?  My god.  And I thought it was bad enough playing tiptoe through the dead carp last year.  The quote that really caught my attention from that article:  ""Rays jump to escape a predator, give birth and shake off parasites,"" said Lynn Gear...  I wonder if this is their version of screaming ""I want an epidural!!"" or if there's an actual benefit that makes them do this.  Anybody know?"
