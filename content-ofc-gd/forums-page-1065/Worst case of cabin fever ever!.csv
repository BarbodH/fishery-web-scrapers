174562,Jigger,2008-03-21 16:51:00,1237,"Bulldawgs hang up too much in the snow, Hook. It just digs too much. Maybe a Jig and creature would be best for your application. You could probably put a hook through one of those flip-flops too. If you haven't washed them since being in the Oshawa creek, they'll have plenty of scent!"
174632,douG,2008-03-21 18:47:00,2693,I think you were fishing too shallow.  Hope this hleps.
174720,scuro,2008-03-21 23:10:00,386,I know your heading south soon so I'm doing a favor for you. Just stare at this pic for the next month anytime you start scratching the walls.

169262,silveradosheriff,2008-03-09 19:15:00,1025,I'm thinking a Daiwa Dead or Alive might entice a feline....
169273,steve barrett,2008-03-09 19:40:00,142,Boy have you got fishing fever really bad. I am just as bad as I went to OWEN SOUND bought a new shimano hat and a set of new tires for my boat trailer.It took off the presure for a short time.It won't be long.
169276,kickingfrog,2008-03-09 19:53:00,8333,I love it!   What were they bite'n on? How deep? GPS coordinates?  I got skunked in my yard.
169281,jediangler,2008-03-09 20:18:00,1923,I've been tempted to get the kayak out for some downhill sledding. Just afraid I might break my paddle while trying to steer.
169555,Tootsie II,2008-03-10 15:45:00,162,I really want to try it from my new 14 ft. wide body Naden tin can but it's turned upside down on the trailer in the back yard and I'm not sure if the impeller on the water pump of my 30 hp. could suck up and melt the snow fast enough to keep the motor cool.
169563,Stoty,2008-03-10 16:30:00,2910,That cold front might shut down the bite.......
169603,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-10 18:41:00,1351,i see you were fishing solo there CH.. maybe next time you should make a post in the hook ups section and i'd join you!  mannnn.. too much new un-used gear that i gotta start using!

174348,wacky tambaqui,2008-03-21 00:35:00,33,"I have my St-Croix Legend Tournament rod in my hand as I write this.  Has anybody tested a St-Croix in such cold conditions?  I would but I'm afraid it might shatter like crystal.  So far my fishing has been limited to watching those Saturday Morning fishing shows with rod in hand. I'm getting the itch real bad. Now which one's going to win the jousting match? My St-Croix or my living room window?  This has been a very trying winter for all of us  Let's hang in there, folks! The ice will open up soon enough."
174362,Crazyhook,2008-03-21 01:36:00,1154,I had my loomis in that pic and its holding up fine...   Cabin fever 2 is coming!
