Hit the local Tackle Shop up there, on 169, just south off 118, found all they had were Creek Chubs, big one a little to big we found out later. We spoke to a local Pro, who told us the phishen was hot, and for a few peanuts he tell us where.  We got to the area, and got set up, and with in an hour Slug had 15 phish on, but wasn't able to keep them on the Chubs were just too big, and the hooks not hooking up. I was able to land 3, using the smallest Chubs I could find, and hooking them very lightly, had to keep one, bleeding to much, about 1.5 lbs. the other 2 were very slim, and went back down. Finally with the wind howling, and the ice cracking, boy was it noisy out there, Slug was finally able to keep one on   Followed shortly with another   When we got back to our cars we found there had been a party, and were they in a sorry state "
