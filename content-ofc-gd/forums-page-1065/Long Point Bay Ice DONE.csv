Coming down the hill we saw two huge open spots, one northeast of St Williams and one south of St Williams that stretched about 2 miles out.  Ice at the shoreline was slushy white ice and no more than 1 - 2 inches. We found an access point (traversed a plank to safer ice) and got out about a quarter mile to six inches of old ice. This stuff didn't feel safe and it certainly wasn't worth it for the 10 or so keepers we caught. Did have an encounter with a small pike which was cool.  When we got back, Sleded fell through before he got to the plank as the ice had warmed throughout the day. It was only to his waste so he was okay. There was a CO down there to check licenses but I think he was there more to make sure people got off the ice okay. There was some crazy people about 3 miles out who were still out when we got off. I hope they got back alive.  I'm sad to see the ice go, but welcoming the spring season at the same time with open arms.  This was a scary ice fishing trip and I won't ever risk it again.     You can see the spot Sleded fell through    Short video:  http://vid93.photobucket.com/albums/l57/Bi...ch/S4022451.flv"
