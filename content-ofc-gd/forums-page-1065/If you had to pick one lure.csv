But for flat out fun - I'd bring an x-rap!  I love fishin' them.  I have way to short of an attention span for twister tails, tubes, etc.  no doubt they catch fish, but I need to keep moving!

174541,setomonkey,2008-03-21 15:57:00,872,"If I only had one lure, and I assume no replacements, I would go for something durable like a spoon. Catches fish, and can take a beating on rocks or from fish bites.  Every other kind of lure in my tacklebox gets worn or chewed up, esp by pike or muskie. Have several crankbaits that have puncture marks, spinnerbait skirts get torn up, and plastics get torn up pretty quickly too.  Mike"
174610,smbhunter,2008-03-21 17:58:00,186,"Only one lure eh?...hmmmmm.......I would have to go with a cotton cordell super spot lipless crank. I've caught drum, catfish, muskie, pike, walleye, perch, bass, crappie, even trout on the smaller sizes, and salmon. I always have one ready to go every time I go out, even through the ice."
174616,muskymike,2008-03-21 18:05:00,772,"One Lure........mine would be an oversized Tube. They seem to attract every type of fish imaginable. Even fish that are half its size. Either a Tiger Tube or Waterwolf. As for color, smoke or grey with fleck.  My luck, I would probably loose it the first cast though and be stuck sitting there"
174705,GbayGiant,2008-03-21 22:47:00,1780,"Various sized jigs a bucket of minnows, can't loose, or a worm harness is hard to beat."

131677,duckdog,2007-11-09 00:04:00,162,I did not even think of the worn harness duh! Yup should have chose it but that's ok I will stick with the spinnerbait :-)
131710,Moosebunk,2007-11-09 01:04:00,3970,Live bait.  Can I have more than one minnow or worm though...?
131713,Clampet,2007-11-09 01:12:00,1947," Yer don't bring worms on a survival trip, you dig 'em."
131747,scuro,2007-11-09 02:50:00,386,"For an all purpose utility lure I would have to say a little cleo. Unlike many of the other choices it works on most species, can be fished throughout the water column, and more importantly can be chucked a good distance accurately. In my mind a wormharness doesn't count because it uses live bait."
131753,Garry2Rs,2007-11-09 03:24:00,1425,"Instead of a simple favourite lure debate, I'm picturing this as a survival situation. One bait to save your life... The spoon is good. The crankbait is too. The jig is super, and any type of spinner, whether it's in-line or bent into a spinnerbait would be a sound choice most of the time. But if you have to put fish on the table and you don't know what you will be fishing for, I would chose a fly. Something mid-size, like a muddler minnow or a woolly worm. They will catch any fish that swims and you can use a tree branch and a piece of string as your rod and line. Garry2rs"
131935,Mark Kulik,2007-11-09 19:09:00,348,Without a doubt a jig of some sort-jigs will catch fish in any situation.

132113,danc,2007-11-10 04:41:00,4677,  Absolutely. You can fish it horizontal or vertical. Fast or slow. Deep or shallow.
132115,scuro,2007-11-10 04:46:00,386,"If we are talking survival one lure fishing, then where did the boat come from?   A jig is nice if you have a boat. If you are tossing from shore and distance or accuracy is a requirement, I'd much rather fish with a little cleo."
132116,holdfast,2007-11-10 04:52:00,1813,"Dark Jointed floating Rapala, Size depending on Species.  Fishing in snags and weeds, it has the best chance for not hooking up.  Great Trolling lure.  Oh you want to fish deep, or cast farther add a sinker.  Does not twist my line.  Only one problem.  You have to bring extra trebles to replace the broken ones from the predetor fish strikes.  As far as Carp fishing, as useless as teats on a Bull.  Then again, Carp is not a sport fish as it is a transplanted mistake."

132121,danc,2007-11-10 05:28:00,4677, I don't understand why you can't get distance and accuracy from shore with a jig.

132144,Spiel,2007-11-10 12:40:00,9065," ....The origional question asks ""If you had to pick one lure, For a trip? (To take with you on a fishing trip what would it be?)""

You don't need a boat to fish a jig anymore than you do any other lure. Oh, and live bait isn't a lure anymore than a hooker is a girlfriend."

131539,lookinforwalleye,2007-11-08 17:30:00,4399,Ya it`s been covered numerous times but I would take a jig if Walleye was the target and a Senko for everything else.  I haven`t caught a Walleye on a Senko yet. Note to self try a Senko next spring.
