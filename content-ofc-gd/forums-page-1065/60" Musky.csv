174791,muskymike,2008-03-22 03:05:00,772,"*** PICS ADDED***  Alright, I dont know if this is going to work so hopefully this pic shows up.  Its my 60"" Musky I caught this FALL. I forgot to mention, I am almost 10' tall, thats why it seems so small. You just have to look at it from that perspective    Here are some more pics from this day, Photobucket is now up and running.  As you can see, the day couldnt have been more perfect for being on the water for November 3rd, just not so great for fishing. It was like this all day.              "
174792,SlowPoke,2008-03-22 03:09:00,2984,"Nice fish but by the size of your hand, I'd put you closer to 11' tall. -Brian"
174793,2 tone z71,2008-03-22 03:10:00,1311,"NICE you look atleast 30 inchs across the shoulders and that fish is twice that so I belive ya   ,not much for girth must be a male"
174795,irishfield,2008-03-22 03:18:00,26272,Gee Slowpoke... sure glad I saved that picture when I did...
174796,muskymike,2008-03-22 03:19:00,772,Well I may be close to 11'. I havnt really measured lately.  I just posted this to see if I could post from another board gallery. The OFC gallery wont let me upload cus my files are too big. And I havnt signed up for photobucket yet.  Soon I will get more pics on here. This was just a test for fun
174797,Jigger,2008-03-22 03:31:00,1237,"Boy what I would give to have one of those beauties on the line right now! Beauty 'ski!  Man, you must be huge. I guess we'll never go fishing, I only have a 14'er... Even if it is a LUND!"
174801,bucktail,2008-03-22 03:42:00,1857,Thats a truly awesome fish!!!!
