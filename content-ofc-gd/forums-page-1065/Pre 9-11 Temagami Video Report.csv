174864,iceguy,2008-03-22 14:46:00,341,"Was converting the old vhs videos to dvds when I came across an old fishing video from a few years back. I put it on a Myspace account for better quality but it has to buffer a bit. MySpace won't play anything with songs that have been copyrighted (example: eye of the tiger(pike)) So don't waste the time uploading, The same goes for facebook. Which is too bad as the quality of videos on these site are much better then youtube. <a href=""http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=30804039"">Iceguys Blast from the past</a><br><embed src=""http://lads.myspace.com/videos/vplayer.swf"" flashvars=""m=30804039&v=2&type=video"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""430"" height=""346""></embed>"
