174930,lovetofish,2008-03-22 17:43:00,500,Was planning on heading up to lake st john in the morning with one of my old fishing buddies.  Was just wondering if anyone has been there and how the fishing has been.  Got my digital camera packed in hopes of getting into some  late season pike fishing Can't wait!!   lovetofish
174945,iceguy,2008-03-22 18:38:00,341,Can't go wrong for pike there. I've caught a few nice ones out of there in the past. Two years back I was talking to guy at the launch and he showed me a nice 12-14 pound pike he caught through the ice.
