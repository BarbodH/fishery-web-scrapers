175088,Ryan Landry,2008-03-23 03:51:00,128,"I would be in for that, I also have a couple extra rods if anyone wants to learn."
175098,Matt C.,2008-03-23 04:23:00,6,"Ryan, I would love to learn how to fly fish.  If you guys give me a time and a place I will meet up with you. This is also my first post so I better introduce myself a bit.  My name is Matt Coatsworth and I'm a Grade 8 teacher in Chatham.  I usually fish for perch (but catch sheepheads and gobies) in Lake Erie.  I am looking into a boat to go out on St. Clair after bass and walleye.  I've been fishing for a while but just now starting to get serious about it.  Thanks for the offer Ryan. ...Matt"
175101,huntervasili,2008-03-23 04:29:00,1604,Welcome to the board Matt... Might want to start up a thread of your own with your intro... you'll likely get many more responses.
175123,Spiel,2008-03-23 11:48:00,9065,"....Well I'm interested, in fact I was interested last year as well. Can't remember why or what kept me away, likely work. If the date turns out to be my day off I'd likely make it."
