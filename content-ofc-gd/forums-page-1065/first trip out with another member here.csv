We fished the Bayfield River.  We got to the river a little late.. met a couple guys there that already had couple of nice bows in the cooler and said some others were caught already this am..  We got skunked today, but had a good first trip together... nobody gave up !  lol I did have one on so i finally got to hear the  bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz of the reel this year!  lol   The three of us are gonna try again tomorrow on Lake Ontario tribs..  Thanx for the board.. it is a great network builder.  Splashopper"

First spot...  freezing cold and the water was dirty... stayed 3 hours... not even a hit..  Packed up headed to the next spot...  One of our guys, Oltroll from here,, first cast... .. WHAMMO !!! 4lb brown trout ! Nice looking fish.  Guys in boats trolling 20-3- yards in front of us getting fish...
