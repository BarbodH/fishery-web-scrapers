172370,Ben_Daniels,2008-03-17 01:08:00,435,"I was at Ashbridges Bay today trying for some open water Brown trout. No luck with the trout but I did see a turtle sunning itself which was pretty cool. I had a chance to take a bunch of pics of it, this turtle let me get within 3 or 4 feet of it without moving very far.   I saw this from a distance and didn't think it looked like a rock...pretty cool with the CN tower in the background.         I think I got a little too close and it went into it's shell, I decided to leave it alone and get back to fishing...even though I wasn't catching anything.   I also saw a small muskrat looking animal, not sure what is was and I didn't have time to take a picture of it. All the animals and birds are coming alive which tells me Spring is coming!!! Can't wait for all the Ice to be off and the fish to be shallow!   -Ben"
172378,danc,2008-03-17 01:19:00,4677,You sure that isn't one of the Leafs??
172391,Joey,2008-03-17 01:51:00,9122,Very cool pics.  I love underwater shots.  Joey
172393,bucktail,2008-03-17 01:59:00,1857,WOW!!!  A turtle! I havnt seen a robin or swallow yet! Thats one brave and cold amphibean!
172412,tdotfisherman,2008-03-17 02:55:00,317,"Nice pics man.. when your urban fishin around the GTA, you never know what kind of wildlife your gonna see.. One time I almost hit a dear in the middle of Scarbrough, driving down to a local fishing spot at 6am.. weird.."
172414,Mike the Pike,2008-03-17 03:00:00,3421, Good one Dan  No sign of spring here -11 tonight
172422,crappieperchhunter,2008-03-17 03:34:00,2582,Nice turtle pics. A few years back right around this time a buddy and I out rainbow fishing in Oshawa creek saw a turtle crawl out of the water and lay on a big chunk of ice. Now after seeing your pics I can say I have saw a turtle this early twice. Thanx for sharing.

172432,ehg,2008-03-17 04:45:00,2666,You probably got  within 3 -4 ft. of turtle since its metabolism is down from hibernation and nearly being frozen. Like the picture with the CN Tower.  ehg
172434,frozen-fire,2008-03-17 06:56:00,542,"Wow...looks to be a large female map turtle. There aren't too many of those around these parts anymore. What a great find! Like the post above stated, you got close to it only because it's so sluggish from the cold temps. If it were in the summer, you probably would've heard a splash even before you saw teh thing!"
172451,Bly,2008-03-17 11:26:00,1556,Cool shots Ben!  Thanks for the little ray of hope that Spring really is on it's way here.
172460,Sinker,2008-03-17 12:05:00,8692,"Not only an uncommon sight for this time of year, but, wow......that IS a map turtle!!  I've never seen one in the wild before. Pretty rare turtle you got there!  Thanks for sharing,  Sinker"
174736,passthepitonspete,2008-03-21 23:53:00,64,"Wow, great photos.   That's probably a map turtle, but could be a Blanding's as well, it's hard to tell and I'm out of practice with the ID.  Either species is fairly rare, so great find!"
174743,fishindevil,2008-03-22 00:28:00,6254,"Nice pics !!!!  i love watching all the wildlife while im fishing,once while fishing i had an osprey hit the water in a dive and grabbed a rock bass,or bluegill by crashing into the water about 40mph,about 50ft from my boat while my back was turned !!!!!    i thought i was gonna have a dang heart attack.....scarred the crap out of me.  ...so better luck at ashbriges next time,nice report too...cheers"
174759,NANUK,2008-03-22 01:31:00,797,"I had never even heard of a map turtle, let alone see one! and it very refreshing to see soft water Thanks for sharing."
174810,mikeymikey,2008-03-22 06:17:00,376,"Nice!  BTW,,, have you seen all those smallers trees around there?  All chew'd down by that beaver. That damned beaver took down so many trees within very short time.  Here are some pictures I took.  Enjoy!       (*some pictures are taken with my phone camera)"
175003,007,2008-03-22 23:06:00,537,Nice Turtle shots Ben.  Glad you guys are getting some spring like weather.  It's been great over here on this side of the pond until today when we had snow and hail - felt like I was back in Canada for a brief moment!  Mikey - I know they do some damage but u gotta have some respect for a beaver that's able to survive in and among all the development of the GTA.  I saw one swimming near the ferry docks one evening last year on my way back from fishing the islands. Pretty cool....  007
175012,outllaw,2008-03-23 00:10:00,1232,wow thats an early turtle. down here he woulda needed a snow shovel today.i did chuckle at the maple leaf comment
