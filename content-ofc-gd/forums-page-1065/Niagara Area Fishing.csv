A very cold wind was blowing, which stirred up the river bead up stream causing the water to become very dirty. A couple of fish were caught between the time we arrived and 10:00 am, but the action was very slow. We headed to Queenston on the Niagara River, there were quite a few boats in the water and the fishing was pretty good with one boat load reporting that they picked up 7 bows. I was able to land a nice brown, just after we arrived about 11:00 am, a few hits after that but no pick ups. "
