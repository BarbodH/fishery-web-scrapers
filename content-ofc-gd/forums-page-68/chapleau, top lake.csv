1025240,kennymb,2018-03-27 21:48:00,2,"Good afternoon, am cottaging in the chapleau area late summer for a week and wondering if anyone has any experience on ""top lake"" fishing? Have been unable to find any maps or anything with depths or structure. I knowÂ there are pickerel in there but not sure what else or where to start. any info on this lake or any others in the Chapleau area that have solid pickerel fishing in it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time. Kenny"

I'd call the Chapleau MNR and ask them if they can help you with info on Top and the lakes in the area. I bet they would help."
