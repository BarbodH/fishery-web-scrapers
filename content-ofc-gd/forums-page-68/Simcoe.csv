1025164,iFish4real,2018-03-26 19:57:00,386,hmmmeah...I guess I should have asked if anybody's willing to PM me info anonymously so there's no lawsuit after I drown under the ice
1025187,John Bacon,2018-03-27 00:24:00,3277,My friend told me that he is still ice fishing out of Innisfil.  He usually just walks out.
