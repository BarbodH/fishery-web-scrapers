1025398,Fish Farmer,2018-03-29 17:14:00,2234,"Vessel licence transfer. Buddy just bought a used boat and wonders where and how much to get it done. He was told it had to be done online at a cost of $365.00, that's not including taxes of purchase. "
1025405,Lape0019,2018-03-29 17:41:00,647,"By vessel, what do you mean?  Is this a fishing boat, a cruiser/yacht or a commercial boat? From what I understand, there is no charge for a fishing boat/pleasure craft but there can be some costs associated to other types of boats under certain circumstances."
1025409,AKRISONER,2018-03-29 18:09:00,5558,"This bureaucratic Bull is friggin stupid  i did it through this webpage using the transfer form....https://www.pcl-pep.snbservices.ca/1001/PubWeb/Application.aspx?lang=en-CA  I hope i did the right thing, you basically need a lawyer to figure it out. So stupid. Lape...you do have transfer the boat license to yourself."
1025429,HTHM,2018-03-29 21:06:00,4082,Service Canada does that I think.
1025431,Fish Farmer,2018-03-29 21:24:00,2234,He tried there Albert and they told him he had to do online. 
1025432,Fish Farmer,2018-03-29 21:30:00,2234,"Buddy just called me and said they charged him $125.00. Your not going to believe me, the guy he sold his boat to found a link and it was free. Man is my buddy pissed. Now how's he going to get his money back?"
1025434,gil,2018-03-29 21:55:00,41,"FF. The fee for registration transfer is $0.00 just fill out the form, send a pic and you are done! They might have nailed him with tax!! Or he did the transfer thru a third party site! See you soon at Maitland!"
1025437,gil,2018-03-29 21:59:00,41,Oh! I forgot! The website is transport Canada! FYI!!!
1025441,Fish Farmer,2018-03-29 22:20:00,2234,"Thanks gil, yes I found the PDF form, I called my buddy hes happy but hopes he can get his money back, what a bunch of Bull. Thanks a million AKRISONER, my buddy thanks you. Man what a bunch of bull you have to go through, my buddys not PC savvy. His son found some outfit that did the transfer and charge his charge card. I told him he should call his card company and cancel the transaction."
1025443,Fish Farmer,2018-03-29 22:29:00,2234,"Beware, can you believe this crap  "
1025445,Lape0019,2018-03-29 22:37:00,647,"That’s seriously messed up. As for transferring the vessel license, yes, I know you have to do it but I did mine at the service Ontario near where I live. I sold the boat in October to a buddy and just asked him if he had to pay anything and the answer was no. And he went to Service Ontario in Ottawa. Amazing to see the different info you get with just a few hundred kilometres difference in location. You’d think it would be standard.  As stated before though, I know there is a charge for a commercial vessel. I think there may be a charge for a cruiser over a certain length too but don’t quote me on that."
1025453,John Bacon,2018-03-29 23:34:00,3277,Wouldn't Service Ontario just be for the trailer plates?  The vessel license is federal.
1025466,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-30 14:06:00,8243,"Trailer is MOT Ontario transfer, boat title is transferred at Service Canada, federal. They may send a tax bill, maybe they won't. Make sure you get a separate invoice for each the boat and the trailer as they will charge you tax on the trailer. I'm not sure about all this on line bull. When I'm told to do something online I tell them I'm 81 and don't own a computager."
1025471,Fish Farmer,2018-03-30 16:57:00,2234,"Hi John My buddy went to service canada and they told him he had to do it online. He said whats that online thing. I don't have a Computer, they said I guess you don't get it registered, thats the only way."
1025475,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-30 18:46:00,8243,Unbelievable.
