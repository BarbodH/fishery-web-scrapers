1024827,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-21 15:15:00,8243,"How right you are Dave. Guys park 50 grand or more worth of trucks and cars in the driveway or street and keep 100 buck lawnmowers and tools they used once and will never use again in the garage. I actually used my garage when I had one, only because I couldn't fit all the cars in the driveway. And I've seen worse garages. We were cleaning out a buddy's garage for his daughters after he passed and found 1 cat skeleton and 1 dead racoon. Ewwww. Oh and plus a bunch of our tools he didn't remember borrowing buried in the mess. . A situation similar to hoarders."
