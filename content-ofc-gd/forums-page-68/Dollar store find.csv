1024876,GBW,2018-03-22 18:20:00,8460,I got 2 and there are 5 left as of right now.  2nd last row near the end of the isle.
1024878,jimmer,2018-03-22 19:17:00,2730,"Okay, thanks! Can they be connected together to form a longer tube?"
1024902,GBW,2018-03-22 23:58:00,8460,looks like it but I didn't try.
1024908,kickingfrog,2018-03-23 02:40:00,8333,"I don't think so, at least not without cutting/modifying one of the tubes. Both ends of the smaller/inner tube are the same size."
1025470,misfish,2018-03-30 15:34:00,29133,"Just packed away 12 ice rods. I need to go and get more now for my 2pc rods. Still looking for a decent storage box for all the reels .  I need to get some tags now ,as I do not know what rods are in which tube. LOL Thanks again Rob for the tip."
1025488,GBW,2018-03-30 22:35:00,8460,Why not get a small to med. plastic tool box?
1025489,GBW,2018-03-30 23:11:00,8460,"No cutting, using 2 tubes, 1 thinner section and two outer/wider sections you have a total of 4'10"" external so 4'9"" internal length.  Straps are stitched so you would need to cut them to not have loose ends and then modify it.  I am sure there is a way to use all four sections too but yet to try as the Leafs game is about to start... "
1025491,GBW,2018-03-30 23:20:00,8460,"So I took a min and made all 4 fit (no cutting but would need tape to keep the middle together and it's 6'6"" internal length.  It goes as follows, wide tube, skinny, skinny but bent a bit to fit into other skinny and then wide again.  As one end of these does not come off"
1025492,misfish,2018-03-30 23:46:00,29133,Yer a smat cookie. LOL
1025497,GBW,2018-03-31 01:59:00,8460,I'm sure I could cut a V out for it to fit better but not going to as I don't need any that long but I thought I'd at least answer the question as to how long can you make it.
1025498,GBW,2018-03-31 02:03:00,8460,here is all 4 sections together 
1025504,Moosebunk,2018-03-31 15:07:00,3970,THAT is a cool score.
1024788,kickingfrog,2018-03-20 20:41:00,8333,At 4 bucks I figured I'd get a few of these. They go from 25 to 40 inches and are just a hair over 3 inches in diameter. Cheap rod tubes. 
1024789,TJQ,2018-03-20 20:47:00,7806,Holy Moly!!  Which Dollar Store....  theres so many now lol
1024796,Rizzo,2018-03-20 21:43:00,4754,do they have one 9 feet long for my musky rods?
1024799,chris.brock,2018-03-20 21:50:00,4053,I haven't seen those. Are they sold as fishing rod tubes or something else?
1024801,GBW,2018-03-20 21:56:00,8460,I'm sure there is a way to turn two tubes into one that would do the trick.  The wide sections are the end with the skinny being the part that would join all 3 sections in the middle.
1024803,GBW,2018-03-20 22:01:00,8460,"What 'brand' of Dollarstore?  And what section to look for them?  Hardware, crafts?  TIA"
1024808,kickingfrog,2018-03-20 23:03:00,8333,Dollarama south end Barrie in the complex that has Cabela's. My wife brought one home for my son's school project last night. I think they are intended for artwork and such. They're not super sturdy but they'll serve a purpose and are a lot lighter than pvc tubes.
1024811,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-21 01:04:00,8243,"Not 4 bucks but I made all my rod tubes out of various lengths of ABS, glued a cap on one end and a threaded coupling on the other end. Made a handles out of old leather belts glued and screwed."
1024816,GBW,2018-03-21 02:13:00,8460,Thanks so now I can check my one and only local one for the same thing.  That is also why I asked if craft section.  Cheers.
1024817,TJQ,2018-03-21 02:14:00,7806,....  stampede to Dollarama makes CTV news tomorrow..
1024820,freddyp,2018-03-21 04:07:00,27,"been using these forever! Dollarama poster cases for kids artwork, love em!"
1024823,grimsbylander,2018-03-21 11:47:00,3016,I'd grab one too for that price...if I owned even one two-piece rod. Good deal.
1024828,misfish,2018-03-21 15:36:00,29133,Im grabbing  a few for the ice rods.
1024829,grimsbylander,2018-03-21 15:38:00,3016,Good idea. Just thought...I should buy one to ship broken rods back for warranty! lol kidding...
1024837,jimmer,2018-03-21 18:57:00,2730,Can you let me know if you find them in Lindsay? Thanks!
1024845,misfish,2018-03-21 20:23:00,29133,"There were 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Thanks again Rob.  They are not that bad really."
1024847,GBW,2018-03-21 21:42:00,8460,"Yes, I forgot to check today.  If they have them and not many would you like me to get you one or two?  You could pick them up from me at Lindsay Kia if so"
1024848,wdodgetruck,2018-03-21 22:16:00,27,I use them for my paper lake charts when fishing lake Ontario.
1024853,huzzsaba,2018-03-21 23:23:00,884,Is 3 inches width enough to fit a 4000 series reel? or would the reels need to come off?
1024856,GBW,2018-03-22 00:49:00,8460,reels off
1024857,huzzsaba,2018-03-22 01:07:00,884,thanks. Didnt have the rod/reel in front of me so could not picture the size of the reel of the top of my head
1024859,GBW,2018-03-22 03:12:00,8460,No worries.  Any reel bigger that an ice fishing reel will not fit and even an ice fishing reel may not...
1024860,16 Footer,2018-03-22 09:52:00,191,I bought one yesterday at Dollarrama. Looks good to carry my rods in on back lake fishing trips.
1024861,misfish,2018-03-22 10:25:00,29133,Reels are off. Im on a quest to find a nice way to keep the reels. Off to dollarama to seek and find.
1024870,jimmer,2018-03-22 15:36:00,2730,"No need, just let me know what you find. Thanks."
