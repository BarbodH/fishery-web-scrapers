1024888,misfish,2018-03-22 20:54:00,29133,Terry was playing with his drone again ?
1024889,AKRISONER,2018-03-22 20:54:00,5558,look at those chemtrails
1024890,Roy,2018-03-22 20:58:00,13728,Not chemtrails....he was having his crops sprayed. Air Canada did it for him last year but he wasn't too happy with the wait times.
1024892,irishfield,2018-03-22 21:05:00,26272,"Yah, I paid Google Earth to put that there, to mark my runway. Now there's no low flying excuses from guys cutting through my airspace! LOL"
1024897,misfish,2018-03-22 22:38:00,29133,I see the carrot pile is finally gone.
1024900,ketchenany,2018-03-22 23:14:00,3229,"Brian, Wayne is going with the times, now it’s all grass!"
1024912,Pigeontroller,2018-03-23 03:29:00,2793,"Wayne, that looks like an awesome property!  Of course now we all know where you live and you'll have to move!!! LMAO"
1024913,irishfield,2018-03-23 04:00:00,26272,Thanks Dax! Was just going to say.. now of course everyone knows where I live. Thanks Cast Away! Lots of hard work is all. Was nothing but a rough field and a forest 25 years ago.
1025087,Cast-Away,2018-03-25 23:35:00,790,"A beautiful place for sure Wayne and a place to be proud of. I remember many past photos inside your shop, a first class operation. Sorry I should have PM'd this to you so everyone doesn't know your coordinates. A funny story for you, I met up with a cousin I haven't seen in 15 years and told him I fly RC planes and the next day he emailed me to ask if my plane is big enough for a second passenger. I sent him a picture of my 65"" Mustang and said if you can fit you can go for a ride!"
1025089,irishfield,2018-03-26 00:01:00,26272,"No harm fella! Was just razing you. Nothing much airplane going on these days, still deep into ""Therapy"" !        "
1025090,Raf,2018-03-26 00:05:00,3495,nice Wayne.
1025091,irishfield,2018-03-26 00:12:00,26272,Thanks Raf! Only 1800 or so hours into it now.... probably 600 left to go. Car was torn down until there wasn't a SINGLE bolt left in the body.
1025093,Loonietoon,2018-03-26 00:31:00,1450,Looking great Wayne... was up your way today.... Could not find the runway for my GMC to land on....

1025096,Cast-Away,2018-03-26 01:49:00,790,Wow what an awesome car to restore Wayne. Do you still work on planes or have you retired?
1025097,irishfield,2018-03-26 02:08:00,26272,"Oh I'm supposed to be working on airplanes and have a few backlogged, but until I get my car (that Dad bought new) finished I can't fit anything in the shop. Hangar is a bit cold yet to work out there, but fortunately my boss is pretty easy to get along with... as long as I remember her Birthday, Valentines Day and a few other special days! LOL The car became my Therapy session and the bonus is I have something to keep after all the appointments are over! LOL It's come a LONG way in 2 years.   "
1025100,HTHM,2018-03-26 03:35:00,4082,I would love to look over the facebook chronicle again. I was wondering how it was turning out. Looks very very excellent Wayne!
