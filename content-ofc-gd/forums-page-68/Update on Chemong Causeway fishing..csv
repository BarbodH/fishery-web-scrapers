If you want the program to be self funding, introduce grace period of 1 month, and after that month introduce a zero tolerance policy. You trespass, litter or whatever else, you get a ticket. You can easily pay the wage of a semi-permament by law officer if you hand out a ticket every time you see someone litter or trespass over the course of a couple summer months. In addition you enforce the parking restrictions very strictly for a period of time. Once you instill the fear of god on everyone, people will start to adhere to the rules once again.  Whats the maximum fine for littering $500? A couple of those tickets i guarantee those folks wouldnt be throwing their fishing line in the lake anymore."

1024968,Sinker,2018-03-24 14:01:00,8692,"Its rediculous how our government works in this province. The whole issue was no enforcement, no man power to enforce, and no money in the budget to provide the manpower.  So, what do they do, hire a separate company, at probably twice what it would cost them to do it themselves, to do the enforcement. Brutal.  S."
