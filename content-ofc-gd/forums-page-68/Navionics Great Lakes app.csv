1025256,mistaredone,2018-03-27 23:03:00,913,I bought the Navionics Great Lakes maps like 4 or 5 years ago for $15 or so. Now the app won’t work because it doesn’t have an update available?  Anyone else navigate this?
1025265,Raycaster,2018-03-28 00:12:00,528,"As far as I know you are SOL. I was in the same situation very happy with my app (actually happier) but Navionic pulled the plug. Its been awhile but I think they stopped updating it and it wouldn't work on the latest OS (Android/IOS). There was an uproar from paid loyal users having to buy the same product twice but Navionics used a excuse like ""Navionics Boating is a new product"" etc. and the other versions should work fine. They didn't and we had to buy the same maps again and suffer in-app purchase ads popping up all the time. We also now have to ""login"" with network access for some accessibility and re-load maps etc. Yes there are some nice options on the new Navionics boating but for a lot of us the older version was fine. So Navionics solved piracy problems and switched to subscription based $$$ by going to Navionics Boating. Don't get me wrong,  I went ahead and bought all the newest versions but it still had a sour taste..."
1025284,Canuck,2018-03-28 02:34:00,491,Me too. But the new version has better features and you can download all of US and Canada if you want and update maps for a year.  Navioniscs is till one of the better systems and the sonar charts feature is pretty cool for finding structure.  worth it to me.
1025556,mistaredone,2018-04-02 00:54:00,913,Man that sucks!  I’ll wait till later in the season to try out the free trial. Looks like they just added on weather and a bunch of other stuff but same maps as before.   Frustrating but not surprised.
1025562,Fish Farmer,2018-04-02 12:17:00,2234,"And when will yours expire?. And here I was going to download the app. nada at $20.99 They should refund your money mistaredone, maybe a phone call is in order."
1025590,Freshtrax,2018-04-02 22:59:00,2215,I use the Canada and US boating one for the last few years. No issues. Pretty sure I paid only 19.99 4-5 years ago worth every penny
