Are they not meant to have fluid added periodically? I removed the stickers on the top but theres no access.  Its a Nautilus motomaster group 24 starting/cranking battery."
1025424,Fisherman,2018-03-29 20:35:00,7201,Some are a sealed top that you can't open once they have been put into service.

1025468,Garnet,2018-03-30 15:26:00,2056,The first sign your battery is soon cooked is adding water. When I was tournament guy I replaced them immediately .
1025477,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-30 18:51:00,8243,I haven't added water to a battery since the 70's. Marine or auto.
1025494,Tjames09,2018-03-31 01:04:00,664,It does seem like an odd maintenance . And messing with battery acid lol. Not to mention no where on the batteries does it say to check the levels   i think I’ll leave it
