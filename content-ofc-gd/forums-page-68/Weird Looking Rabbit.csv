1025040,bobowski,2018-03-25 16:47:00,360,I was out walking my dog the other day when I came across this deceased rabbit. Any idea what animal would have done this? Assuming it was done by an animal.

1025070,Rizzo,2018-03-25 21:20:00,4754,Our cat ripped the head off a bunny before. Unfortunately she still had said bunny in her mouth when I opened the door to let her back in at 2 am. And unfortunately it was 2 am so I was groggy and didn't even see the bunny in Kitty's mouth. Man did I hear about that one the next morning when the decapitated bloody beast was discovered.

1025084,Canuck,2018-03-25 23:07:00,491,We had our dog on an all rabbit diet to try to narrow down allergies.  So put it in the freezer and Ill come and get it.  Might save me $10 or so.  (kidding)
