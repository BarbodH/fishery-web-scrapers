1024739,Dutch01,2018-03-20 01:05:00,1431,"Funny, but also sadly true! .?"
1024749,BillM,2018-03-20 03:45:00,17367,"With a 1000 views and 25 replies, you can bet there will be a few Tim Hortons cups there now"
1024752,Dutch01,2018-03-20 11:43:00,1431,"It was going to be rammed there soon anyways.  If you know that spot, you know it, and if you've never been there you won't find it from my picture. I thought about posting this one instead but it's not as nice lol  "
1024773,SirCranksalot,2018-03-20 16:31:00,3291,Exactly!  Can't figure out loc from pic if you don't know where it was. But those who know the spot will be more keen to go now. Presumably that does not include a herd of lurkers. 
1024312,Dutch01,2018-03-11 03:57:00,1431,"What a day! I've quickly forgotten the early end to my ice season. Got out on a lake O trib today and managed two beauty fish (both released). No point trying to black out the background, you either know this spot or you don't. Cheers!  "
1024322,lunkerbasshunter,2018-03-11 13:55:00,2585,that is amazing.  love the colours
1024323,Ralph Field,2018-03-11 14:03:00,1018,Well done! Those are two beauties.
1024325,Dutch01,2018-03-11 14:31:00,1431,Thanks guys. It's been twenty years since I fished the rivers. I forgot how much fun it can be. I'll be going back this week.
1024334,BillM,2018-03-11 17:50:00,17367,Nice man!  No floods this year? lol
1024335,Rizzo,2018-03-11 18:29:00,4754,coupla real beauties!
1024344,misfish,2018-03-11 21:17:00,29133,"My son has been full force on the tribs and doing very well. Keeps sending pics. I told him when the ice season is done, I,ll join him. Trout for him, white fish for me. Both happy happy.  Very nice fish."
1024347,Dutch01,2018-03-11 22:00:00,1431,"No floods, but there were ice bergs high up on the shore so it flooded at some point before I got there. Thanks! Thanks. I didn't know you could get whitefish in the rivers this time of year. I thought that was a fall thing. Where I shore fish for perch in spring (Simcoe) they are always closed."
1024348,misfish,2018-03-11 22:15:00,29133,"LOL Im still fishing the lake (Simcoe ) til the 15th, he is fishing the tribs"
1024349,Dutch01,2018-03-11 22:17:00,1431,D'oh! I get it now...
1024358,PUMP KNOWS,2018-03-12 03:35:00,937,Nice Dutch. The second fish looks like it's spawned out?
1024361,Dutch01,2018-03-12 04:24:00,1431,That's what my buddy was saying he thought too.
1024383,DJGeneral,2018-03-12 17:13:00,163,sweeeeeet!
1024406,misfish,2018-03-12 21:57:00,29133,"My son has caught a few that have done their deed and returning to the lake. I found it strange. Then again, this weather has us all screwed up."
1024461,MJL,2018-03-13 23:50:00,2427,"I had a lot of great memories fishing that stretch as a kid during March break. I wiped out on that muddy path so many times – mud, ice and felt soles do not mix.LOL   It’s been a good while since I last fished there. Can’t imagine what the crowds are like now. They were horrible even 20yrs ago. But at least a few times a year, you’d see a rainbow over 20lbs get caught. It might be time to finally break out the float gear for a drift or two.  Great fish!"
1024463,Dutch01,2018-03-14 00:10:00,1431,"Thanks! We were lucky, it wasn't very busy. I don't think it will stay like that for long though."
1024545,Dutch01,2018-03-15 18:06:00,1431,Booked a day off work today hoping to avoid the weekend crowds on the river and it paid off.  Only the one fish today but it was a great way to spend a morning. About a million times better than going to the office! 
1024552,PUMP KNOWS,2018-03-15 19:31:00,937,Nice one
1024555,AKRISONER,2018-03-15 20:35:00,5558,"friggin tank, well done"
1024558,GBW,2018-03-15 21:17:00,8460,"Damn man, and here I thought you were the walleye whisperer..."
1024560,Dutch01,2018-03-15 21:40:00,1431,"Thanks!  Thanks! I don't know about whisperer lol! I do love me some walleye. We're made for each other, we both like to stay up late. Not gonna lie though, that rainbow could out pull a stringer full of walleye in a tug of war! ???"
1024617,akaShag,2018-03-17 17:08:00,2073,Many moons since I fished the Lake Ontario streams and rivers..... .............looks like a lamprey wound on that last steelie? Doug
1024621,Dutch01,2018-03-17 19:57:00,1431,I was thinking the same thing.
1024706,ccmtcanada,2018-03-19 17:28:00,7971,"It’s been a while since I fished there, but I do miss it!   A few solid fish there for sure!"
1024710,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-19 19:37:00,8243,Dem right der are some beauty fishes. And I know exactly where you are. Pretty well any Lake Ontario tributary. It is not a well know spot though. That fact is confirmed by the lack of Tim Hortoncups.
