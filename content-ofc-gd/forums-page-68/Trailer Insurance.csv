1025134,irishfield,2018-03-26 16:20:00,26272,"Read your home policy and talk to your broker. Trailers are covered against claims arising of out ownership, use or operation or it's equipment.... ""provided it's not attached or being towed by a vehicle subject to registration"". At that point your vehicle insurance covers it, although I'm not sure about replacement if stolen. In both cases it could be liability only. My boat insurance covers my trailer for replacement value, so with that said I guess I should ask my broker about my new enclosed trailer as well. Only one with any value to worry about. Anything being carried / stored inside is insured as would your stuff as ""personal belongings"" when stored in the yard."

1025198,spooner_jr,2018-03-27 11:10:00,193,"Most homeowner policies will limit coverage for a trailer ($1000 etc).  Liability extends from the towing vehicle, and to cover the trailer for comp and collision should cost $50-80 depending on the value of it."
