I came over a hill one day in the tractor trailer I was driving and a cow was in the road, just guessing that it was farther away than his was, but I hit the brakes and was able to stop, how would a computer react?"
1024935,AKRISONER,2018-03-23 19:02:00,5558,"faster, and more precisely. Its sensors and processor react faster than your brains capability to see the cow, realize that you need to brake, and then subsequently physically apply the brake. It would do all of this in a fraction of the time."
1024936,Dutch01,2018-03-23 19:14:00,1431,Agreed.
1024937,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-23 20:08:00,8243,"As always a logical reply from Akrisoner. I also agree. Computers can make decisions without adrenaline, emotions and the like effecting or is it affecting) it's decision in a millisecond, we can't. Much of my job responsibility was replaced by a Supervisory Computer system designed in Finland taking in thousands of flows, temps, pressures in a second plus a Mass Spectrometer doing gas analysis by the second making us redundant apparently.  However when the system went down the new guys and gals were lost. Thus all the calls at God awful times of the night and day. Including vacations. If the bleeder flame was blue I went back to what I was doing if it was orange I went into work."

1024939,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-23 20:24:00,8243,I agree also Tom. I like driving a car not the other way around. We took a newer Caddy from Haldimand for a ride a few weeks back when we were shopping. By the time we got to the river I was already bored. The new to my wife's Kia is fun to drive. I drive it using the 6 speed auto/manual shifter. I'd rather have a clutch. Try finding a Gen Xer or Millennial that can use a clutch. A clutch is an anti theft device for the aforementioned drivers.

Basically the only way to get it is through a very custom even more so expensive order. Paddle shifting in F1 completely changed that process...you know why...because just like the rest of the thread A computer is capable of depressing the clutch, rev matching your flywheel and engaging the clutch once again to make perfect gear shifts in a milisecond. Just watch an F1 drivers cockpit view they shift...the speed at which they can change gears going into and out of corners is stupid. You dont have the abiliity to do this, but a computer sure as heck does, and thus its faster. It sucks because I friggin love driving stick, but i havent driven a stick car since i sold my protege 4 years ago. It sucks but thats the reality of technology."

It's a bit more understandable on a high-powered car like those though, since keeping that power under control while shifting could be difficult for the average driver. But on a Subaru? Nah, give me the stick and let me have fun. I feel like you loose your connection to the drivetrain, I guess I'm just a control freak. Kind of reminds me of the last flying Vulcan bomber that was grounded because all it's systems are 50's era electronics and the knowledge to keep it flying is disappearing. If something goes wrong it's game over for the pilots. Compare that to a 40's era bomber, which can be flown as long as the airframe and engines are solid because all the systems are mechanical or simple electrics. "

I have a hard time seeing a 401 full of AV's.  Do they have a way of telling another vehicle they have to get into their lane to exit the highway?  Sorry not very knowledgeable about AV's and how they will fit into the system.  I do know that computers are not my friend and they are worse when they are not working efficiently.  I guess they would be okay with the newer generations that are comfortable with technology.  I see tech being forced on everyone from banks, entertainment to now AV's. I couldn't afford one anyway."
1024787,Sterling,2018-03-20 20:40:00,477,Has it been determined that the fatality was caused by a bug? Or would have this happened anyway?
1024795,grimsbylander,2018-03-20 21:33:00,3016,"Just reading this now....it was so predictable that the first incident would spark the anti AV campaign. I'm sure the change outrage has happened multiple times though history like when the iron horses first hit the streets and when the first plane went down. But the reality of it is this, it's coming and if you don't believe it you're in denial. There's computers controlling traffic lights, air traffic control, your vehicle's onboard systems(ie ABS, throttle), planes, on and on. And all these things have ""what if"" circumstances everyday. I see people making decisions on the highway every damn day that a toaster could have done better. This is the evolution of technology and it may not happen tomorrow or next week but it's coming."
1024800,Dutch01,2018-03-20 21:56:00,1431,That's a good question. People are assuming a human diver would not have hit the pedestrian. That may not be the case.

1024813,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-21 01:28:00,8243,"I didn't start the tread as an anti A/V revolt. It may have morphed into one. I actually hope I'm still alive to see it become the norm. Heck look at all the money I will save flying across the country or to South America. I could be 90 and still drive. I wonder how much more an AV will cost than a conventional auto with a steering wheel and a throttle and brake pedal. I assumed when they come out it could be driven the conventional way, not without controls. I remember my Noni telling me when they started putting in telephone and hydro poles they were afraid they would fall over onto their houses and kill someone. Never happen unless they were hit by an AV. I've not heard from any of the auto guys guesstimate what they will cost. (wow guesstimate is a spellcheck word)"
1024815,G.mech,2018-03-21 01:58:00,830,And there was a human behind the wheel also according to the report I read......This seems like a real world test that proved that some accidents may actually be unavoidable to the motorist.

FYI: I was typing a response here and the technology said no you don't and booted me out of the site. LOL Sorry I still don't trust it even though tech is part of my every day life."
1024840,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-21 19:18:00,8243,"A question I have is will an AV be able to differentiate between a Dog running out on the road or a kid? We aren't supposed to stop or swerve for a Dog or any other future roadkill, but we do it naturally without thinking, I know I do without thinking about it. It may save wildlife along with Humans. More questions than answers this early in testing but 2022 is only 4 years away. I was watching Motoring 2018 a few weeks ago, someone with Transportation Canada or one of our watchdog organizations said we here in Canada are 20 years away from having AV's be the norm here in Canada."

I'm 100% sure the technology on that car has better abilities to detect and avoid collisions than humans have... Besides that, probably most people have no idea how much we're already exposed to fully automated equipment out there. Nowadays most planes take off, land and fly by themselves and how about laser surgury? You're trusting your eyes totally to a computer... Justa few to mention..."
1024893,chris.brock,2018-03-22 21:41:00,4053,"In the video it doesn't look like the car even hit the brakes. What kind of sensors do AVs use to detect other objects? Whatever system they use, it didn't look too safe in that video."

Uber has suspended it's testing of C/AV cars after a fatality today involving a AV car and pedestrian. I don't want to be a Dinosaur but I personally think we are a long way from calling for our car and it shows up for you. There is a recent Caddy commercial C6 I think, that does not have a steering wheel. I have always been a contingency type of guy, a back up for a back up when I was in the work force. Ford has also announced their AV's that they are hoping to be on the roads for 2022 will not have a steering wheel or brake pedal. I was under the wrong impression that these things could be driven the old fashion way like steering and stopping in the event of a technical failure. Wrong again.

On a more serious note, I have to agree with Dutch. There is no debate. AVs are safer. Let's start counting up the tens of thousands of hours AVs have without at-fault collision or fatalities. AVs are superior in every single way. The decision not to ""trust"" AVs is an emotional one only, this cannot be debated. For every fatality caused (despite) autonomous behavior, how many lives were saved? I would suggest starting with Tesla's AV videos, these will blow your mind. Instant and intelligent collision avoidance. Not only does the vehicle avoid the collision, but it does so in the safest way possible. AVs don't speed, get tired, drunk, drugged, sick, distracted, or injured. They see through fog and whiteouts. They slow down during freezing conditions. Have instant reflexes. Eliminate gridlock. Can drive at night while you sleep. Save you on plane tickets. Allow you to work while traveling. Save money on insurance. The list is endless. Ask yourself this; do you trust yourself more than AVs? Possibly. Do you trust AVs more than the average driver? Hell yes!"
