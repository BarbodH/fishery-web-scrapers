1025318,AKRISONER,2018-03-28 17:47:00,5558,"zone 20 Pike closes on Friday...maybe consider that?  If so, see you out there"
1025320,DJGeneral,2018-03-28 17:56:00,163,"Okay, i didnt know that wouldnt keep em even if they were in season and i guess ill see you out there too"
1025322,AKRISONER,2018-03-28 19:27:00,5558,sorry...i meant Saturday what the heck am i saying  anyways...ill be in the skeeter bass boat out around the islands.
1025324,DJGeneral,2018-03-28 19:33:00,163,LOL! ill be fishing from shore what ever shore spots have open water i guess
1025325,Sinker,2018-03-28 19:42:00,8692,Lake simcoe is still covered in 2 ft of ice. 
1025328,AKRISONER,2018-03-28 19:46:00,5558,im pretty sure everything is wide open...maybe a little ice in the very back channels but aside from that she looks pretty ice free. I spoke with the harbor master today on the phone to get my harbor license and he seemed to imply that I would be travelling through the back channels and warned me that they are not currrently fully marked because its so early in the season. If you see me out there give me a wave.
1025345,John Bacon,2018-03-28 21:24:00,3277,Are you talking about Simcoe or Toronto?  	My friend is still ice fishing on Simcoe.  So I wouldn't expect it to be wide open just yet.
1025348,BillM,2018-03-28 21:57:00,17367,"Toronto Islands, pike fishing before the season closes.   Come on guys!  lol"
1025350,misfish,2018-03-28 22:31:00,29133,"If I told you where I was going Friday, Bill would drive over and slap me up side the head.  No matter where you end up, enjoy the day with yer pop DJ."
1025351,DJGeneral,2018-03-28 22:58:00,163,Sounds good! But I guess I’ll have to change my route based one what these guys are saying Take one for the team misfish Lol but thanks anyways
1025357,BillM,2018-03-29 00:38:00,17367,"As long as you're safe, I'm good man, lol!   (Although probably a little jealous!!!)"
1025371,AKRISONER,2018-03-29 12:06:00,5558,"sounds like someone is either going ice fishing...(you are insane) Or to a honey hole...and if so, send your GPS coordinates thanks."

1025393,Tjames09,2018-03-29 16:28:00,664,Confusing thread. One person plans to have the boat out and the other says sim or has 2 feet of ice.....you guys talking about the same simcoe???  i know In the Kawartha most of the lakes are pretty much open now.
1025407,DJGeneral,2018-03-29 17:54:00,163,trust me i know lol i should have never made this post guess ill be bottom bouncing roe bags again tmr
1025416,Sinker,2018-03-29 18:55:00,8692,Simcoe is frozen over. Zone 20 (lake Ontario) is open water.  S.
1025417,AKRISONER,2018-03-29 19:04:00,5558,"The OP asked about whether there was any open water near simcoe for pike...I pointed out that Zone 20 closes Saturday hence, theres a great opportunity to fish for some big pike this weekend. I mentioned to keep an eye out for me and give me a wave. Its always good to meet other OFCers"
1025419,DJGeneral,2018-03-29 19:20:00,163,"Sorry Budd i guess i read that wrong, where you launching from ? Ill be heading down to the river mouth at one the eastern tribs i fish "
1025422,dintymoore,2018-03-29 19:58:00,62,"Any one know of any sites for current satellite imagery (like Google Earth, but up to date?"
1025423,AKRISONER,2018-03-29 19:59:00,5558,"humber bay boat launch...ill probably be off the water late morning though, apparently they are calling for 80kmh winds....efff that...unfortuntaely thats probably when the best fishing of the day will be...but 18 foot boats and 80kmh great lakes winds dont mix.  https://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html  click on the lake you wanna see its every day"
1025425,Fisherman,2018-03-29 20:37:00,7201,If there's no cloud cover.
1025427,misfish,2018-03-29 21:01:00,29133,"Open water where I,ll be. My ice gear is put away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   ALMOST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

1025433,Tjames09,2018-03-29 21:47:00,664,I think he was asking specifically if Lake Simcoe was frozen or if it was open water. I think he wanted to take his dad ice fishing. Thats how I read it
