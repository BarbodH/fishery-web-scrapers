1024909,mrpike,2018-03-23 02:55:00,151,HI! folkes  I am looking for a portable transducer mount .So I can use my lowrance Elite 9 ti     0n other boats that I go out on . I like the Minn Kota one but can't find one  ( Minn Kota Transducer  JCH 2032031 )   Any Ideas what store carries it . THANKS. I know I can order online but I was hoping to buy it locally.   MY transducer is very large and it costs $ 300.00 bucks . SO I need something stronger than normal.
1024915,AKRISONER,2018-03-23 11:34:00,5558,"pretty sure i have seen one at bass pro man, either that or id order one online. Just be wary that I wouldnt suggest running one fast down the lake. my 15hp tinner going 20 would knock it off regularly if i hit a wave etc. better to just toss it back in the boat when not stationary or going slow."
1024916,Terry,2018-03-23 12:22:00,14456,Is this for on a trolling motor or on the back of a boat
1024918,kickingfrog,2018-03-23 13:19:00,8333,I mounted mine on a 1x2 piece of pine and use a C-clamp. It worked on tillers/tinnys and on a bigger ski/fish boat.
1024919,Terry,2018-03-23 13:36:00,14456,Yeah the cheap suction ones don’t stay on but if you buy a suction cup for glass and modd it. They work well
1024921,Tomcat,2018-03-23 14:30:00,395,I've been using a transducer mount (Standard/Regular model) that I purchased at Cabela's years ago - works like a charm. See Cabela's item IK-010095
1024934,Sinker,2018-03-23 19:01:00,8692,"I have one I could sell you for cheap. I forget the brand, but it works great. I can get a  photo later on if you Pm me your cell number. I am in the peterborough area.  Its a clamp on set up that will work for any boat. Its made by a rod holder company, but the name escapes me at the moment.  S."
1024940,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-23 20:34:00,8243,X2. I never found a suction cup that would stay on anything. I was going to mount it on a piece of wood then clamp it on the transom but never did.
1024946,GBW,2018-03-23 23:18:00,8460,this...

1024957,spincast,2018-03-24 11:41:00,3279,"saw these guys at a fishing show a couple years ago. Picked up one of their complete set ups for the canoe and when I go to lodges etc. Works awesome.  allows you to mount the screen anywhere in the boat. https://www.fishfindermounts.com/ not the cheapest solution out there, but if you do this often, it s worth it. Just make sure you explain to the folks at security at the airport that its a fishfinder before you put it through xray"
1024967,Sinker,2018-03-24 13:58:00,8692,"The one I have is a tite lok transducer mount like this one I think. I forgot to dig it out last night.  It might be a little different than the one in the link, but it works, and the price is right.  http://www.titelok.com/product-p/trd-5798.htm  If your ever in the kawartha's, its yours.  S."
1024969,BassMan11,2018-03-24 14:17:00,583,Best way to do it. Took this on fly ins or anytime we needed a transducer on a cached boat. Works like a charm. Screw in cable tie saddles down the piece of wood and use cable ties to manage the transducer cable. 
1024971,BillM,2018-03-24 14:38:00,17367,I've had no issues with the suction cup mounts on multiple fly-ins.  Just gotta make sure it's positioned correctly.
1025103,porkpie,2018-03-26 09:17:00,2521,"I have the totalscan transducer on my boat.  There is no way that thing will stay put on a suction cup mount.  You will have to take Sinker up on his offer, or make something solid out of wood and C clamps as suggested.  The suction cup works great for my portable bird transducer, but it's tiny in comparison to the total scan!"
