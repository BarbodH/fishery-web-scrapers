1025153,AKRISONER,2018-03-26 18:42:00,5558,"maybe this topic hits a little closer to home because my family are gun owners, while i live in a neighborhood that has one of the highest incidences of gun violence in Canada. I think you could technically even call me a victim after a recent shooting in my apartment buildings lobby that made me and my girlfriend feel very unsettled. Its never nice going to your lobby and seeing it taped off and riddled with bulletholes. Subsequently there have been two homicides within close proximity of my home as well, one where an innocent bystander was caught in the crossfire and killed. Why are we spending a pile of resources changing a system that works, but ignoring a related system that appears to be entirely broken when it comes to illegal hand guns? I think our time and energy is far better suited to fixing a real tangible problem then changing regulations to try and fix something that has had a few incidences fall through the cracks."
1025155,Dutch01,2018-03-26 18:50:00,1431,"That's binary thinking though, it's not an ""either/or"" thing. We can aim to combat illegal gun crime and also strengthen gun regulations to keep legal guns out of the hands of the unfit at the same time. The self defense angle doesn't work for me. Currently the courts and our storage laws do not make using a legal gun for home defense realistic or practical. Having said that, you are probably more likely in Canada to accidentally kill yourself with your own gun than to be attacked in your own home by a complete stranger. "

1025176,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-26 20:47:00,10439,Canada is a very safe country when compared to the US and a lot of other countries. If I was living in the US I'd definitely would feel a lot safer with a sidearm. And that is due to their gun laws and background check system. If their system was similar to the Canadian one I think you would see way less gun violence over there.
1025180,aplumma,2018-03-26 22:02:00,6896,good words to end this on. Thanks to all for not winding up and getting to political or bashing each other. I personally hope that Canada never goes down the same road that the US has gone where a gun is needed to protect you from another gun.

As stated before with a gun in the house an accidental death of someone in your house is more likely then you killing a bad guy with a gun in your house. You are more likely to die of scalding water...you are 180 times more likely to blow your brains outs...  	The reality is armed robbery of your house is a relatively rare event, especially in Canada. In the US the risk of dying by a robber with a gun in your house is 0.0000002. I'm sure it happens but I've never even heard of it happening to someone I know, let alone experienced it."

1025116,jonasdry,2018-03-26 13:01:00,63,"My belief is that we should be able to own and use anything that we can own and use responsibly. Until the time an individual is shown not to be a responsible owner/user of anything it should not be taken away. Almost anything can be used as a weapon but there is only one object that people focus on, firearms. In terms of casualties, firearms aren't at the top of the list of items. If people really cared about reducing harm to people they would focus on the top of the list items, but they don't. They would also focus on the reason's for such events, but they don't. There are very passionate people on both sides of the debate unfortunately what has been seen can never be unseen. An average handi-person (get it, haha) can build a firearm in their garage with common tools meaning you cannot simply ban firearms. Where there is a will there is a way. The anti-firearm crowd doesn't seem to understand this and doesn't understand it is impossible to get rid of all guns entirely. The pro-gun crowd understands this and believe as long as criminals have access to firearms they should have the right to have ones to defend themselves if need be. I am a firearms guy and I have stated as soon as the government can guarantee 100% without a doubt a criminal will never use a firearm on me, I will give up mine. Until then, I will keep my guns thank you. I use my guns for a lot of hunting, target shooting and competition so they aren't just sitting around while I am being paranoid, they are being used for 100% legit and recreational purposes but I can assure you if someone ever does break into my house I can have them out of a safe in a matter of seconds."
1025117,akaShag,2018-03-26 13:22:00,2073,"If you use firearms for hunting, target shooting, and competition, why on earth would you surrender them to the government?  This makes no sense whatsoever.  And has already been stated, the likelihood in Canada is very remote of a person being confronted in their home by an intruder with a firearm.  In MOST areas."
1025122,AKRISONER,2018-03-26 13:58:00,5558,"I do have to chuckle at the pro gun enthusiasts that say we need less restrictions on fire arms and more abiliity to ""defend"" our homes by using firearms...  Then we have the liberals proposing new legislation that works to make it more difficult to obtain registered legal weapons on people with valid gun licenses underogoin the apporpriate checks. Can anyone here please provide a statistic or example of a person in Canada being murdered with a legal valid weapon? The closest thing was that guy in Saskatchewan that shot intruders on his property. I would say that is a very far cry from a school shooting. I dont know the specific's of that event...I dont think anyone does, but I think we can all agree that your personal possessions like someones tomatos, or even a used car are not worth shooting and killing someone over...thats what insurance is for.  Regardless...can we all not agree that as it currently stands Canada's gun control laws appear to be working almost perfectly? So why the hell do we even debate it? Why change anything. the system is working...it may not be perfect, but gun owners have guns and people aren't dying. No one here is dying from legally purchased weapons, meanwhile our friends in the states have multiple mass shootings per year with legally purchased weapons. The evidence is clear that we have things figured out pretty well apparently. Dont try and fix whats not broken.  Illegal handguns are a whole other issue...they need stricter mandatory sentencing for these clowns...lock em up for 15 years on an attempted murder charge...plain and simple...you get caught carrying an illegal handgun...your intent is clearly to kill someone...boom 15 years bye bye.

It has no range, isn't accurate and is useless in close quarters. It wouldn't stop big game. When I was a kid it was normal to walk into someone's home that hunted to see the long guns displayed in the open. We never, and I repeat never had ammo readily available. Yes accidents do happen. The teenaged daughter of friend of the family tragically took her fathers loaded shotgun while the family was having dinner, went into her room and took her own life. After that happened we bought a gun safe and locked them all up. That was the early 70's. Something was changing and nobody really knew why. It is still the norm to see weapons readily available in American homes and vehicles. My 91 year old Uncle from southern Illinois across the border of St. Louis does not leave his rural home without his loaded Glock, never. There is always a loaded long gun by each door. I am not in a position to judge or presume my opinion is the right one. Read a St. Louis newspaper or watch the news on TV in the morning and I bet anti gun folks may just change their mind set."

1025053,Canuck,2018-03-25 18:26:00,491,"To say an AR-15 is nothing more than a mean 22 is horse-$crap.  Tell that to the parents of the kids in Florida (he used an AR-15).  Tell that to the parents of the kids from Sandy Hook (killed mostly with a Bushmaster version of AR-15) or the relatives of Vegas victims (shooter had AR-15s and that was the weapon used with the bump stocks to give near automatic rifle performance.  They seem to be pretty effective at two legged big game. You can hunt in the US with an AR-15.  You can hunt in many, maybe most states with an AR-15 with a 30 round clip.   (which you would need in order to bring down anything of any size).   I swear that the reason some states allow hunting with AR type guns is to prevent any attempt at banning ARs but not hunting weapons.  Call it a hunting weapon and it is all ok, right? Hey Canadian's, the f-ed up lack of gun laws in the US is going to cause us problems in Canada (by overreaction to solve a problem we don't have in Canada).  What will prevent it best, is rational gun laws in the US that bring their gun death stats down in line with the rest of the civilized world.  But that won't happen."

1025055,akaShag,2018-03-25 18:36:00,2073,"The Bushmaster is an AR-15 variant, and it is RESTRICTED.  All of the AR-15s and all of the rifles for which the parts are interchangeable, including the Norinco stuff from China, all of these are Restricted here in Canada.  But there are lots of semi-automatic .223s that are (currently) non-restricted.  It is the 12 (9) provision in the draft C-71 tabled this past week that should be of concern to persons who own non-restricted semi-automatic firearms, since the RCMP can decide that something currently non-restricted (like the Swiss Arms Classic) is now a Prohib."

I would expect or National government to try to get restrictions right for each weapon. I would hope few could own a howitzer and that it would be heavily restricted. It wouldn't bother me if some totally responsible establishment had one howitzer so that you could pay to fire it. The restrictions on AR-15 sound about right. I'm open to listening to counter arguments for either weapon. It sounds like most motivated citizens could own the AR-15 if desired. The default position is that buying lethal weapons should not be easy and that restrictions need to be in place for public safety. Beyond that I don't care. The less guns the better in my opinion but if there is a huge public desire for guns that is okay too.  	Back to the facts and reality...all around the world stats show that generally more gun ownership equals more gun deaths. It's more complicated then that but that general outcome holds true."

Unless an intruder has already taken a shot at you with his gun you are going to be sharing a cell with the same guy unless you killed him. How long would it take to unlock your safe, unlock the trigger lock, unlock the ammo box, load the weapon and use it, too late your already dead and so is your wife and children. We do not have ""Stand your ground"" legislation in this country. If you are assaulted with someone's fists, that's what you can defend yourself with, if he uses a pointy stick, you can use a pointy stick, you all get my point. Long gone is the day when that idiot of a man in Hamilton shot dead a teen stealing his GD tomatoes, thank goodness but there must be some middle ground. I'd rather attend my criminal trial for protecting my family than a Funeral Home grieving the loss of my family. A 22 takes a .22 round, the AR-15 type of weapon takes a .223 round. There is not a concern able difference. Of course it can kill a person, it has. Thankfully many were injured and not killed because it was only .223. Shag and M2 may know but if I remember correctly some law enforcement and the military versions of the AR-15 type weapons have a larger caliber round. Everyone incorrectly calls a AR-15 type weapon an AR-15, it was the first of it's design but many others have copied the original, like The Bushmaster has copied it. Lawsuits have been hashed out."

Totally agree on that point about keeping this Canadian.

No. I reached for a bat. Guess who's in jail? It isn't me. You CAN defend your family and property with deadly force if absolutely necessary. But that has it's own set of laws as well. Like if the perp is subdued, you cannot just beat him to death. Once neutralized legally you must stop. See a guy steal your car? Can't do nothing legally to stop him. Its the law. If a guy enters illegally and presents a firearm, you have every right to shoot, legally. OI, this gets to the point I addressed earlier and perhaps you missed it or I worded it wrong. In a b&e your not likely to reach for a gun. Why? Exactly as you stated. By the time you get your gun you might already be dead. The laws in place make it highly unlikely and unpractical to try to get your gun. Thus a bat or knife or something will hopefully suffice. I prefer the bat, because subbing the perp is my goal.

Then you hear that it won't stop criminals....well no it won't , but that is like saying we should not have laws against anything because someone will still commit a crime."

1024952,LittleWorm,2018-03-24 01:26:00,122,"Not sure what that is about but TAHNK YOU for the post, I forgot all about my PAL licence and it expired in December. Guess I better get on that before I get a knock on the door.lol"
1024963,Canuck,2018-03-24 13:31:00,491,"Somewhat related.  When I was growing up I had quite a few guns at home, but when I went off to University, of course they stayed home with my parents.  They moved around Canada a lot, and so did I, but at some point I got my 12ga pump from them, but left a nice old bolt action 22, a 410 and a 22 hand gun passed down from my uncle.  A few years later, I asked my Dad where they were.  So here is the story: He got nervous about the handgun because he was not sure if it was registered, so he took it down to the Lake O waterfront and threw it out as far as he could throw.  AAARGH. The 410 and 22 he put into the car and went to the local police station.  Luckily he did not bring them in with him, he told the duty officer he had a couple guns in the car to give them.  Well, they didn't handcuff him, but they were VERY nervous and it took a while for them to be comfortable to go out to the car and let him open the trunk.  They ended up taking the guns from him  AARGH #2.  I still don't think he realizes how bad it could have been if he walked those guns up to the front desk."
1024965,Sinker,2018-03-24 13:43:00,8692,I wonder how many they will get? This country is messed up.   S.
1024970,Freshtrax,2018-03-24 14:28:00,2215,"If anyone needs to get rid of some I will provide a nice warm home and treat them nice.  It makes sense for these amnesty days for people who have illegal guns , get them off the streets, that being said if  rather see them in the hands of a collector than be destroyed ."
1024972,manitoubass2,2018-03-24 14:41:00,11391,"Well in the area I live in I'm gonna go ahead and guess they get zero. Maybe, maybe a few from a pissed off wife or something"
1024986,cisco,2018-03-24 21:34:00,597,I think the main donor group is elder ladies whose husbands have passed on. The nice police will come to their home and leave with all the guns. Expensive or not she won't be compensated. Sad. They should all go to an appraiser and be auctioned legally if possible with proceeds to her or her selected charity.
1024989,akaShag,2018-03-24 21:57:00,2073,"Sounds like a local police initiative.  The feds have just introduced a new firearms bill, C-71, which talks about getting guns off the streets but which ONLY and EXCLUSIVELY targets (you guessed it) law-abiding firearms owners.  It repeals some of the common sense firearms legislation enacted by the Conservatives and creates a NEW class of prohibited firearm, to which the feds fairly clearly intend to add a bunch of currently non-restricted firearms (think SKS etc) and makes two fairly popular firearms prohibs after 30 June. Anyways every time there is a LIEBERAL gun control act introduced you can bet that law-abiding gun owners are going to get the sand in the Vaseline and the scumball criminals will face zero new sanctions.  C-71 does absolutely ZILCH to take action against the criminal use of firearms. And it sounds to me like your local coppers have decided this is an opportune time to put out another request for people to turn in their guns. Doug"
1024995,dave524,2018-03-24 22:39:00,4508,"The Feds are not adding to the restricted and prohibited list , they are giving the RCMP the power to do that, the police will not only enforce the rules they will be making them now"
1025001,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-24 23:45:00,10439,We can only hope this gets rolled back next year when the libs get trounced in the election.
1025002,akaShag,2018-03-24 23:51:00,2073,"back to dave 524........YES the C-71 DOES make some new firearms into prohibs.  Four versions of the VZ 858, 2 non-restricted, 2 restricted, are now (after 30 June) prohibited firearms.  these ones: (i) Ceská Zbrojovka (CZ) Model CZ858 Tactical-2P 	rifle, 10 	(ii) Ceská Zbrojovka (CZ) Model CZ858 Tactical-2V 	rifle, 	(iii) Ceská Zbrojovka (CZ) Model CZ858 Tactical-4P 	rifle, or 	(iv) Ceská Zbrojovka (CZ) Model CZ858 Tactical-4V 15 	rifle; and it also makes the SAN Swiss Arms, currently non-restricted, into prohibs effective 30 June.  These are NEW prohibitions.  And yes when I say the Feds can add more rifles to the new 12 (9) class of prohibs, it will be the RCMP that makes the calls.  And the scarlet tunics are NOT on our side in this, they are deeply in the pocket of the oxygen thieves currently in power in Oddawa."
1025003,Tjames09,2018-03-25 00:07:00,664,This is the target audience. Not sure about the auction idea.

1025005,akaShag,2018-03-25 00:28:00,2073,"If a widow is the executor of her late husband's estate and the husband had a valid PAL, the widow is allowed to dispose of the firearms as if she also had a PAL.  (I am simplifying.) A great way to dispose of firearms is to contact a reputable auction house and have them look after the cataloguing and sale.  Here in Southern Ontario the name that comes to mind is Switzer's Auctions from Bancroft Ontario. When I advise older folks looking to dispose of a firearms collection, I always point them to Switzer's.  I have on occasion bought the firearms from an estate but generally speaking, the estate is better off dealing with a REPUTABLE auction house and not a private individual.

1025027,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-25 14:26:00,8243,"They can take my weapons from my cold dead hands. When they had the gun amnesty years ago my dear father gave them my turn of the century Berretta side by side willed to me by my Grand Father and about 8 grand worth (then) of other long guns my brother and I had in our childhood home as well as the WW2 Luger with the SS holster and a Walther PPK my uncle snagged in Europe during the war then willed to me in the 70's. Thanks Pops but I shouldn't have left them there.  Ah man, thanks for reminding me. I'm still not over it."
1025029,scuro2,2018-03-25 14:47:00,904,"When 6 out 10 gun deaths in the US are suicides, and you as a good guy are more likely to see a loved one killed in your house by accidental gun death then you are likely to kill a bad guy with a gun in your house, ...the target audience for police collections could simply be anyone that is concerned about overall safety of having a deadly weapon within their household. May be grandpa has gotten a little to ""dark"" lately. I have no problem with people owning guns for hunting, collecting, or that are required for pest control etc. But, that doesn't mean that every type of weapon should be available to everyone.  	The actual need for guns for protection in Canada is WAY over hyped by the fear mongers. I'm all for police gun collections and I am all for further restrictions on assault like weapons of warfare. The evidence is overwhelming more guns = more gun deaths period."

1025033,scuro2,2018-03-25 15:50:00,904,"The house should be divided. Get off your high horse and recognize reality. Some have made the issue of guns into a moral cause approaching a patriotic duty. In the end they are lethal weapons that end up killing far more innocent people then bad guys. They need FEDERAL restrictions for the safety of population.  	As to your second point, seriously, should every Canadian have ability to buy an AR15? Does every Canadian need one? It is a weapon of warfare as documented in the G&M video below  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/video-the-ar-15-in-canada-what-you-need-to-know/"
1025034,manitoubass2,2018-03-25 16:01:00,11391,"An AR-15 is a weapon of war? That's the last darn gun I'd want strapped on my back in a war lol Before it gets political, it's clear your anti firearms and I'm pro firearms. Let's just meet in the middle, me keeping mine and you not having any"
1025035,scuro2,2018-03-25 16:05:00,904,"Obviously you didn't watch the video. I have fired guns. I don't give a rats ass about you owning guns. Stop with the shrill, they are going to take my guns away Bull. I only care when zealots try to erode necessary restrictions on guns."
1025037,manitoubass2,2018-03-25 16:09:00,11391,Hmmmm. Perhaps it's best you don't own weapons.
1025039,scuro2,2018-03-25 16:14:00,904,"Yes, perhaps it's best if some people don't own weapons. I choose not to have guns in my house because they are a bigger danger then they are a tool of safety.  	Reality MB2, consider reality. Think of it...with all the gangs and crime in the US, still 6 out of 10 gun deaths are suicides. Then there are the accidental deaths. Just in the last month two teachers accidentally shot either themselves or students in school!  	More guns = more gun deaths period."
1025041,manitoubass2,2018-03-25 16:47:00,11391,"More people also equals more death, correct? I'm talking about our country, not the US. They have their own issues and we have ours. Gun restrictions will NEVER STOP A CRIMINAL ACT, and that includes suicides. Somebody wants to commit a crime or kill themselves, odds are it's happening with or without a gun. Where I live we have a huge rate of resident gun owners. Guess what else we have? A huge rate of suicides. BUT.... Guess how many are gun related? Almost ZERO! WOW EH? It's pills, booze and or rope. And I wish you'de include hunters in your argument. Most gun owners in Ontario own guns for????? HUNTING!!!! IMAGINE THAT! just so happens they can also be used to protect your property and family. BUT.... Most gun owners, know the restrictions already in place, and owning guns does almost zero to protect you in a break in related crime. Thus, we have bats, knives etc to defend ourselves. As it's highly impractible and almost impossible to have the time needed to ready a firearm in a break-in related situation. Your rational thinking, or lack thereof is part of the problem, not a solution."
1025044,akaShag,2018-03-25 17:28:00,2073,"OK I watched the video. Mr Day should KNOW BETTER than to suggest a person can HUNT with an AR-15 or any of its variants.  There is no place in Canada where a person can legally hunt with ANY restricted firearm.  That includes all of the AR-15 variants, all handguns (that are not prohibited, which of course also cannot be used for hunting), and any other firearm designated as restricted (or prohibited). To acquire and possess any restricted firearm, yes a person has to take and pass the course, and apply for a Restricted Possession and Acquisition Licence.  As part of the approval process (which Mr Day also neglected to mention), there is not only the criminal records check, but also a confirmation with the spouse and any ex-spouse that there are no domestic violence issues that may be a concern, PLUS a confirmation that the applicant does not have mental health issues.  Every 24 hours the entire list of individuals having a firearms licence is cross-checked with the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC).  It is noteworthy that CPIC does not run daily checks on anybody else, not paroled rapists and pedophiles, not career criminals, not known gangsters, only firearms licence holders. Restricted firearms need to be stored in a very secure manner (all described in detail in the regulations).  Ammunition for them most be stored in a separate locked container.  IN CANADA, the likelihood of a child, or other non-licenced individual, getting access to an AR-15 or ammunition for it is remote.  And as Mr Day did mention, all magazines for the AR-15 family of firearms must not be capable of holding more than five cartridges.  While there may have been an instance of somebody in Canada using an AR-15 in a ""mass shooting"" I am not aware of it.  The people who own them are amongst the most vetted and thereby law-abiding people in Canada. I do not own an AR-15, nor any of the variants, given that they hold no attraction for me.  But I consider it perfectly reasonable that folks who wish to own and shoot this type of IMMENSELY popular firearm should be able to do so.  If they want to go through the hassle in order to take their firearm to an approved range to shoot it, more power to them. And no, I don't buy the argument that more guns equals more gun deaths.  In Canada that is simply not true, and people using AMERICAN statistics to make points about CANADIAN firearms issues are definitely mixing apples and oranges."
1025046,manitoubass2,2018-03-25 17:37:00,11391,"Well put shag. And that's completely factual information as all of us gun owners KNOW. Scuro, you might want to lay off news outlets for reliable information. All news has an agenda, thus they leave out precise information needed to inform to fit whatever the agenda of the day is. There are far more credible sources of info available to you, I or anybody else directly on the government's website FYI. So if you want to know, go to the source. That's logical and rational approach. Eliminate the 3rd and 4th party info which is clearly flawed and or downright incorrect."
