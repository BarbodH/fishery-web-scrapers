I've put almost 1400kms on it so not bad for a first year and limited snow. I would have to say I'm so please with my purchase, it is a perfect sled for what I wanted it for and it has performed flawlessly above my expectations. Watching the weather forecast the last week or so I was bummed about the prospect of this rain ending the year and after checking the trail status on OFSC website, it looks like this last weekend was the time to go. On Saturday morning my friends Lynn and Kevin and I headed from Ottawa to Deep river where we started our ride. We took the A trail up to Mattawa and had lunch at the Mattawa golf course club house. The hills and scenery were awesome, the trails were in mint shape and the day was beautiful, couldn't ask for better. We headed back to the park and ride in DR and after all was done we did 280 kms over about 7 hrs. We talked about going again Monday to give ourselves a day of rest but a quick check of the weather brought on the possibility that if we didn't go Sunday we might not be able to go Monday. So, up bright and early Sunday and drove to Deep river again for another ride, same place but mix up the trails a bit. Ater a fantastic 5.5 hrs on the trails we had gone 190 kms. The weather was awesome, could not have asked for better. 470kms on the sleds and 800kms on the trucks. Here are a few of my favorite pics of the trails over the 2 days. "

1024557,pics,2018-03-15 20:36:00,1268,Haha.. I thought it seemed familiar.. Looks fun..
1024562,BillM,2018-03-15 21:49:00,17367,Matt went again? lol
1024607,Joeytier,2018-03-16 22:29:00,3990,Well the trails are still great north of 17 if you're still interested lol...another 3-4 weeks of sledding and hardwater here.
1024609,muskymatt,2018-03-16 22:36:00,2608,I'm heading up to Rolphton tomorrow to do the trails there. Can't wait. Trails are in great shape from what I hear. 
1024807,Spanky80,2018-03-20 22:57:00,152,"Nice pics!  Our gang was up that way this past weekend, trailered to Stonecliffe and snowmobiled to Mattawa, stayed at Valois and returned Sunday.  Awesome weekend!"
1024814,irishfield,2018-03-21 01:35:00,26272,"2+ feet of snow in Temagami and 24"" of GOOD ice + a top coat. Best sled travel in YEARS, like riding on a cushion of air. Pulling huts at 45MPH or more at times with zero issues. Great week, going to go back up again. Still a month of ice left for sure.  "
1024838,AKRISONER,2018-03-21 19:10:00,5558,"no need to even go that far, weve got over 30 inches of ice just north of parry sound. plus the crappies are biting...wish we had a little more snow, but it looks like ice off is at least a month away. "
1024841,irishfield,2018-03-21 19:31:00,26272,"I could sled down the road from my place here in Penetang, drive through my F-in-Laws yard and right onto Gbay myself Akrisoner... just no adventure in that for me when it's in the ""back yard"". One interesting Winter that's for sure!"
1024850,misfish,2018-03-21 22:42:00,29133,Wheres all the fish pics Wayne? That yammadoo guy catch anything?
1024851,irishfield,2018-03-21 22:50:00,26272,"Yammadoo guy?! Why on earth would I take him, when I had this company for 7 days! LOL  "
1024852,misfish,2018-03-21 22:55:00,29133,"Ya, I see your point. LOL"
1024905,KraTToR,2018-03-23 01:54:00,506,"i'm heading 2 hours north of Ottawa for the weekend..  Best conditions of the year they say.  Hope so, it would be a nice way to end it.    "
1024906,muskymatt,2018-03-23 02:05:00,2608,I'm heading out of Ottawa tomorrow  at 6am to head up as well. Going solo lol no friends I guess. Will be an awesome day on the trails regardless.
