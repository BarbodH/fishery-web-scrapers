He was also suspended from fishing in Ontario for 10 years. http://mnrwatch.com/13050-fine-and-licence-suspension-for-over-limit-of-walleye/"
1025396,BillM,2018-03-29 17:00:00,17367,10 year fishing suspension?  Should have banned him for ever entering Canada again.   poacher!
1025397,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-29 17:03:00,10439,"Should have taken his truck, 5th wheel and boat as well. "
1025399,Jmeyer,2018-03-29 17:14:00,83,Sad reality is for every ten of these instances only one will get caught. Wonder how a non resident could justify taking that much from foreign waters like Canada some how owes it too him. Taking in the fact he had his own boat and fifth wheel means he probably didn't even spend more then two hundred bucks in tourist dollars. I've seen it many times over years but usually the sense of entitlement comes from dropping thousands on a fly in
1025400,BillM,2018-03-29 17:20:00,17367,I can't even begin to think how many times this guy has done this and never been caught.
1025402,AKRISONER,2018-03-29 17:29:00,5558,"why the hell are we so soft on this kinda crap. Like dude built a false floor into his fifth wheel to assist him in poaching in a foreign country? All we do is fine him? what the hell! take his passport, never let him back in the damn country.  10,000 bucks? and he lied to the officers? How are there not criminal charges being pressed. God we are soft on this kinda crap...thats why it keeps happening."
1025403,Jmeyer,2018-03-29 17:34:00,83,Sadly he will probably never pay the fine because there is little recourse the bonus is he will never be back.
1025456,OhioFisherman,2018-03-30 00:31:00,6623,I wonder if his friends and neighbors know how great a sportsman he is?
1025457,woodenboater,2018-03-30 00:54:00,2277,"yup.shoulda taken his fifth and boat. hopefully CBS will have his name and face in the database so if he tries to come to Canada, he'll get his arse turned around fast. an give his truck and camper the full tear down inspection."
1025463,buckhorn250,2018-03-30 09:45:00,85,"""Upon further inspection of the trailer, the officers discovered a chest freezer with a built-in compartment under a false bottom "" ""87 over the combined possession limit for Krueger and his spouse"" Geez if this doesn't warrant a lifetime ban I cant image what would. "
1025485,SirCranksalot,2018-03-30 22:28:00,3291,Should have nailed his scrotum to a stump and flipped him over backwards!!!
1025487,GBW,2018-03-30 22:33:00,8460,I like the way you think. He really should have gotten it all taken away and banned for life
1025493,glen,2018-03-31 00:42:00,2641,Why didn’t he have a fish tank then he could of had fresh fish instead of frozen.
