1024956,HTHM,2018-03-24 04:35:00,4082,Wings at Pub Fiction afterwards.
1024976,misfish,2018-03-24 17:22:00,29133,I thought this was next weekend????????????????????????
1024978,pics,2018-03-24 18:52:00,1268,Sadly I am on days so I will not make it this year.. So many great deals..
1024980,Spiel,2018-03-24 20:51:00,9065,I stocked up on Bruce's salsa..... 	I did leave a little for you though Albert.  	Good to see you today Bruce. Many thanks. 
1024985,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-24 21:29:00,8243,"This was the 1st year I missed it. The boys went and Featherstone Ted got a great deal on a 5 series Humminbird combo. He thinks he bought some jigs from Bruce. H said the peameal on a bun was great as usual. Last year I took a short cut that took me 35 minutes in the wrong direction. I'm always getting lost up that way. By the time I was walking into the venue in the freezing rain I ran into HTHM walking out with a handful of rods. I don't need anymore weapons of mass distraction anyway. The weather was a heck of a lot better then last year, for sure."
1024991,bigugli,2018-03-24 22:14:00,6138,"We missed you, and a few others this year. Folks were looking for you in particular. What kinda trouble you in this time.???"
1024992,bigugli,2018-03-24 22:15:00,6138,Enjoy the salsa. That stuff has had time to age!
1024993,Fish Farmer,2018-03-24 22:29:00,2234,"Was another great swap. I think a bigger place is needed. Man was it packed with people. Met so many buddies, forgot to buy anything LOL. Left and went to a Turkey shoot in Lynden."
1024994,HTHM,2018-03-24 22:37:00,4082,"WasÂ  there, all I gotta say is: people need to learn how to walk or not stand in a group in the middle of an aisle. Bruce, just had some of the salsa ..... ageing makes a difference!"
1025000,Tom S,2018-03-24 23:42:00,362,"Came through at 9:30, stayed for about an hour. Picked up some deals for myself, some reels and a bamboo rod that needs to be rescued. Based on this year's crowd I think they should start looking for a bigger venue for next year, it felt very crowded and it would have been nice to have somewhere with some tables and chairs set up to sit down."
1025006,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-25 01:28:00,8243,"Don't believe everything they print in the Spec. It wasn't me. Fake news. I said last year they need either a bigger venue or need to use all the space they have. Kids have to have fun but it's a waste of space, it was basically MT last year in the kiddie casting area. Standing 5 deep in front of a table sucks. Actually one of the reasons I didn't go."
1025007,Spiel,2018-03-25 01:28:00,9065,"Had some for dinner Bruce, warmed up with some lean ground beef over pasta.....delicious! "
1025014,HTHM,2018-03-25 04:07:00,4082,That is exactly what we did as well. Yummy!
