The sun rise was like a rocket launch     Fish came and went    And I needed a garnish to go with them so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,    Day 2 weather looks great. Wednesday looks really windy. Thursday the season closer looks awesome.    "
1024393,Terry,2018-03-12 18:57:00,14456,"wow, good thing i was not block i seem to take a much more aggressive approach his plate would read, he's walking.... to get 4 tires"
1024398,Rizzo,2018-03-12 20:57:00,4754,That is unbelievable! Why the heck would someone do that? Setting himself up for vandalism in my opinion. Is there more to this story? (ie is it a private road and nobody is supposed to go down there? or is this truly as crazy as it looks?)
1024400,fishingwithbob,2018-03-12 21:11:00,123,"surprised no one left him a note, on his front seat after they smashed his window.......  #justsayin"
1024401,misfish,2018-03-12 21:16:00,29133,"Not private Roger. Just ingorance  Im sure there are some that would have, but I am past those days. Live and learn I say. Except the white fish. Had another great feed tonight. Fish on a bun and steamed fish as well, with butter and garlic.."
1024402,Whitespinnerbait,2018-03-12 21:17:00,2038,Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE !!!!!
1024403,Fisherman,2018-03-12 21:20:00,7201,"I think I would have called the fuzz for a tow truck, impeding traffic."
1024404,misfish,2018-03-12 21:28:00,29133,"Yes, the fishing has been. And the sun rise was as well."
1024417,DanD,2018-03-13 10:59:00,2223,"It's to bad I wasn't with you in the parking lot. It's so easy to pop the shift cable off at the transmission. One click of the shift lever, taking it out of park. Stand back and watch the van, ever so genitally roll into the ditch. Pop the cable back on and no damage done; other then the cost of a tow truck to get out of the ditch and a bottle of aspirin for his headache. The headache would be from trying to figure out how the van ended up there. Dan."
1024418,NAW,2018-03-13 11:02:00,4022,I'd hook your Goat up to the front of his van and pull him out of the way! You got good tires....
1024425,BillM,2018-03-13 13:24:00,17367,I like the way Dan thinks
1024426,Fish Farmer,2018-03-13 13:33:00,2234,"4 flat tires in the making Side cutters on the stems.. Problem with this is you make waves, next will be NO Parking signs."
1024489,misfish,2018-03-14 17:57:00,29133,"Last thing I or we want, is to lose more access areas. Had a couple hours this morning. to get a fish in. Stayed close and fished 12 fow. You just never know where they will be. 1/3.  Thursday is the end. Might break my rule and fish all day. LOL  "
1024491,SirCranksalot,2018-03-14 18:59:00,3291,A nasty note on his windshield might have some effect.
1024493,misfish,2018-03-14 19:19:00,29133,"Would seem a couple of friends have taken it to FB. I dont do FB, . From what I have heard, it,s better then any nasty note I could of left. Plus like in the video, he was told/asked,to park straight. Ignored the friendly advice."
1024494,farsider,2018-03-14 20:05:00,456,"If he/she is so proud to be Fashionable, Sexy, Haute, and Nouveau, I guess there was nothing left for consideration and/or parking skills. https://issuu.com/fshnmagazine  Cheers, Mark "
1024530,Sinker,2018-03-15 13:24:00,8692,"That parking job may have wrecked my day, and his/hers. What a tool! I'm pretty sure my tow strap would have been wrapped around the hitch of that thing, and I woulda yanked the back end around until I could get by. That's ignorance at its finest, and I am sooooo sick of ignorance lately.  S."
1024597,jimmer,2018-03-16 20:19:00,2730,"Sad that someone has no respect for others. Always good to avoid confrontation, because you never really know the person and what they are capable of.  I might have called the police though."

1024689,Rustic-Fisher,2018-03-19 11:53:00,826,"We could make a game outta this , sent Brian a pic of the same van parked in the no parking area at the Ganny this weekend LOL! Whats wrong with people lol"
