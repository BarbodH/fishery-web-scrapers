102535,pikeie,2007-08-09 22:52:00,380,"so after a quick decision to go up to my favrioute smallmouth lakes this past weekend, i was pumped!! so this is a lake that tinbanger and his father always fished when he was young. so after a long drive my famly and i made it to the lake. the weater was great and the water was like glass. we got set up and went over to a campsite to set up base camp for the day. after everything was set up on shore i went down and took a few casts, i tied on a tube and right when the tube hit the water a bass takes it and takes a nice jump. i get her to the boat and it is a nice 1 1/2 lbs fish, fairly avrage on this lake. so we get out in the boat and start fishing, after a few rock bass i got the first decent smallie of the day, meaused 17.5 inches long around 2 lbs.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186699974  after that it was fish after fish all around the same size didnt bother with pics.  after my sister was done with catching the smaller fish on worms i riged her up with a jig and grub combo, boy did she catch lots of fish on that!! http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186698507 http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186698526 http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186698547  what do you think a future BBR ahaha http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186698570  my brother with a smaller bass http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186698634  so in the next few hours we caught so many fish that the was no time to take any pictures lol the fish were all avrage of 1 1/2 lbs or larger, at one point we were drifting over a rock pile with some big boulders and i see 3-4 big smallies over 3 lbs, i had them follow but not comit lots of times finally one bit short and didnt get hooked well only had it one for a few seconds, i would have been mad if i wasnt catching so many bass tho lol.  so we are fishing a nice shorline with lots of rip rap and we are catching the normal 2 lbsers. we come upon a little weed bed and i toss in a tube, i get a hit and the fish agian feels smaller, so i didnt say anything to anyone. once i pulled it 10 feet off the weed bed boy did the fish take off!! jumping and splashing and running constintly. after it jumped near the boat i noticed i hooked the first largie of the day and it was a really big one. i never noticed how big it was till it finally got in the net!! here are a few action pics.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186699428 http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186699450 and here is the fish in all its glory lol the fish was 22 inches long and 6 lbs!! and it was a real fattie, i could get my closed fist in its mouth. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186699503 after a few quick pictures the fish took off strong http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1186699584  we talked to a few locals on the lake and havent heard of fish that big coming out of the lake in a long time. so we spent the rest of the day till sunset catching more and more smallies. it was definatly a memorable day out there. cant wait till we get back there"
