102272,turtle,2007-08-09 00:56:00,274,I am in Haliburton but a bit further north of Drag Lk.  Water has warmed up since I was last up in the first two weeks of July when it got colder.  Last weekend one lake trout caught down 45 ft in around 60 ft on a Yozuri minnow bait and the sm bass on tubes has picked up.

102293,SikkuDog,2007-08-09 02:03:00,8,"We just got back from Drag Lake.  It wasnt really a fishing trip, but I did take the canoe up with me and got out a couple times.  Found a sweet smallie hole on south west end.  Was literally catching a smallie every 2nd cast.  Nothing huge, but my god it was fun...  Found a drop off ridge later on and drifted it a couple times - which resulted in the 'big one' of the week...  Nothing but rock bass from our dock.  Had a great time!"
102296,Nemo,2007-08-09 02:24:00,727,I have been up most weekends at Kash and was off last week. The bite was slow for pics I think it was the hot weather.  Saw a couple pics of some 30 + Muskie this June. Took my cousin out and he nailea couple 1 - 2 pound smallies and a 14 inch pic on a worm harness shallow say 9 p.m.  Next week I am up again for the week. So if you are in Kash look for me 14 foot tinny Lund out near the big Island by Ingoldsby.  Any other info PM me.

102606,Iamcanadian,2007-08-10 09:01:00,14,"Went out last night for a couple hours, and about a half an hour before sunset the rainbows turned right on. caught 3 and lost 4 , about 1.5lbs each. not big but they fought hard!"
