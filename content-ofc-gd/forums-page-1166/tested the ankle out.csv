Well, one nice jump later and the fish is off.Was not a long bass but was it ever fat.That would turn out to be the only hit in 3 hours.Still nice to get out with my son as always.Below the dam in the last pic it is about a foot deep in most spots,pretty weedy and fast moving.In this area I watched what had to be a 15-20lb. carp swimming around,going under the weeds and back out again.I want to go back again and try to get him but was wondering how to go about it.From the pics I have seen on here carp are usually fished for in ponds,more open water,etc.I was wondering if there is a way of catching them in a mess like this.Any suggestions would be great.Oh,sorry for another skunked report but will keep working on it."

102331,Marko,2007-08-09 09:13:00,854,"To get those carp, try using some corn and a sinker and just cast close to the fish and hope it bites. I catch them in a water like that all the time using corn. Good luck"
102337,mcallister.grant,2007-08-09 10:29:00,327,Wow.... Is that water ever low? Is there walleye in there in the spring/fall? I have never fished the Grand? Thanks.
102376,fatherof3,2007-08-09 14:00:00,1769,"Grant, it is actually the Speed river in Cambridge which flows into the Grand river. The conservation website does not mention anything about walleye but says small/largemouth bass,pike,bullhead,carp,panfish and rainbow/brown/brook trout can all be caught."
