Or at least something bigger than sunfish  We went fishing this morning at our regular spot and we hooked up with a buddy and his son. Let me tell you, they didn't get away from me or anyone else today. We all caught a total of 20 fish. We got some rockbass, catfish and a ton of sunfish. I caught 2 catfish and 2 sunfish. I know that they weren't big fish but it put the confiedence back into me    My son caught his best to date record: 6 sunfish, 2 crayfish and 2 brook trouts(tiny 4-6""). My daughter caught a brook trout also (tiny too, see pic). We caught the trout at a different place that we heard of.  Anyways I just wanted to let you know about our family outing and to show you some pics of the fish. Only got pics of the kids, I'll get some of me next time. The picture of my daughters fish was her second, caught and reeled in by herself. I didn't have the camera for her fish one which was a sunfish. I was mad that I didn't have the camera but it goes with us every time now.   Here's my son with his sunfish   Here's another sunfish   Another sunfish. He could catch them all day.   My daughter's TINY Trout  Well, thanks again for the replies and I always look forward to reading all of the posts that you all put on here. There are some very helpful stuff put on here. Keep up the good fishing everyone."
