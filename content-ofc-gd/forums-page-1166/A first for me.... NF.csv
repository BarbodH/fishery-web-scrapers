I have seen that a million times but this was a little different. His/her (politically correct) wings were not moving. I thought it was pretty neat, so I thought I would share it with everyone.    "

102720,dustink,2007-08-10 16:53:00,526,"Great pic....  Yeah, we've got a feeder right a window at home, and have seen them sit like that.  We also have a dead pine tree that will come down soon, but they like to sit in that too....  Good to know even those busy guys need to stop and rest for a bit!!  dk"
