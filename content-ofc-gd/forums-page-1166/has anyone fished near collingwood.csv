102401,fishinBrant,2007-08-09 15:01:00,10,"i headed up to Collingwood camping in a few weeks, and i was wondering if that part of Georgian bay gets fished. I really don't want to look like a fool up there. you can always tell when someone is new to your area in how they fish. i am not looking for secrets or hot spots just  hoping for a little info . thanks for your support guys .."
102419,glen,2007-08-09 15:36:00,2641,That area gets fished  for rainbows and salmon more than anything else.  Find a spot on shore close to deep water and start casting.
102423,silvio,2007-08-09 16:01:00,433,"Try Collingwood harbor I fished it for bows but I am sure there are other species there as well. Also try the mouth of the Beaver River there maybe some fish. Bring spoons for both salmon and pike, worms for pan fish and bass. And bring tube jigs for bass because if you hook some small ones on worms you’re going to get bigger ones on tubes. Don’t forget to tell me what you caught on your trip  good luck. my advice to you is if its raining one morning bare the elements and head to the harbor or river mouth and cast spoons such as blue/silver little Cleo you wont be disappointed. Good luck."
102459,Gerritt,2007-08-09 17:59:00,6129,Yup I second the Beaver.  Gerritt.
102460,douG,2007-08-09 18:04:00,2693,Time fishing is never wasted. imo.
102467,ADC,2007-08-09 18:34:00,82,"  Im not sure where I saw it but.... I read an article about Beaver river from July of this year and they were talking about how bad the bite has been.  Ive never fished it myself and follow the rule of ""believe nothing of what you hear and half of what you see"" so I hope it isnt as bad as they made it out to be.  good luck"
102468,fishinBrant,2007-08-09 18:36:00,10,i cant thank you guys enough !!  i really look forward in trying some fishing up there we taking a small 14ft shallow bottom with portable down riggers  we be camping at craighleigh  park  i hope its nice there.  and i also have to add you right fishing is not time wasted lol
102489,glen,2007-08-09 20:11:00,2641,If you have a boat all the better.  A few thoughts as i used to fish there a lot.  Run Northern Kings blue and silver or spoons like that.  50' down in 80' to 140' of water.  Please post your results.
102496,fishinBrant,2007-08-09 20:24:00,10,thanks for the tip.  i will post my results let you all know how i made out .  CANT WAIT
102506,misfish,2007-08-09 20:47:00,29133,"I past the Mad River twice in the past week.If it,s a tell tale of whats going on,the rivers are a right off.WAY LOW.Even the notty is way below norm.  WE NEED RAIN AND LOTS OF IT."
102599,camillj,2007-08-10 03:30:00,1988,"Rainbow, Splake, Whitefish ... thats the normal fare ... then there's Chinook, Coho, even the odd Atlantic.. of course the Lakers .... oh ... and did I mention Whitefish ????"
102685,fishinBrant,2007-08-10 13:44:00,10,Very nice  sounds like a lot of fun up there.  1 question  how far out ( how deep ) you guys normally go out.  i think its collingwood harbor we will put in right ?
102724,glen,2007-08-10 17:19:00,2641,Launch out of collingwood harbor would be good.  I hope it is not too windy.  go north from harbor for about a mile then head east about two miles.  Anywhere around there should be some fish.  50' down in 80' to 140' of water.
102828,GbayGiant,2007-08-11 01:35:00,1780,"Do you have a big boat to go off shore ? or do you want to fish from shore/river ? give me a PM I grew up there, but I don't know what the bite is like now. Mostly Bows and Salmon in the area."
