102804,glen,2007-08-10 23:58:00,2641,For $100.00 i would have taken 5 or 6 stings  and done it myself.
102806,Gerritt,2007-08-11 00:12:00,6129,"I would have paid 10,000.00 seeing as how I am deathly allergic to them... the only good bee is the one you dont piss off... I have been able to live in harmony with them for 10 years now... just dont swat them or threaten them... and you too can live in peace with the world pollinator...     Gerritt."
102811,Daplumma,2007-08-11 00:39:00,1961,I have taken out 4 wasp nests in the last few days here.I prefer to use starting fluid and a badmitten racket...old school all the way.I guess I did it wrong cause I remove the nest and whack the ones that come back to rebuild.If they build a nest out by the garden or woods I'm ok with that.They built two on my deck by the door and two in my shed where the bird seed is so they had to go.Its quite the rush swatting them buggers when they are peed off! Joe
102819,Greencoachdog,2007-08-11 01:00:00,8163," Throw in a two-four and that could be a sport in the Redneck Olympics!!!  Yellow Jackets and Guinea Wasps will not be tolerated around my house, those little sots hurt!!! I like the Wasp and Hornet spray that kills on contact!  Mud Daubers, Honey Bees, and Red wasps don't  bother me and I don't bother them.... but Ol' Yeller beats them all to a mushy pulp with a fly swatter and lets God sort them out."
102858,Hooked,2007-08-11 04:03:00,891,"Bees need to rest too, so if yer gonna tackle this on yer own, do it at night, they are quite lethargic then.  That stuff Pikehunter posted looks like it maybe the ticket for you."
102717,bigfish1965,2007-08-10 16:48:00,3382,"We hada big one in the soffit a few years back and hired PCO to come kill them. I think it was 100 bucks or so, but they were gone and never came back."
102719,wallyboss,2007-08-10 16:52:00,1095,"I used to find some often in my old line of work, and all i did was leave a small container with Varsol in it close to the nest and within a couple of days they had vacated. I guess they can't stand the smell."
102723,Roy,2007-08-10 17:04:00,13728,"Looks like I must be the only one who doesn't kill them. I have never in 25 years of having 20 or so kids running around the house had a kid get stung. NEVER. New kids sometimes get panicky when we're eating outside for the first few times but when you sit down with them and explain that they won't hurt you, the kids get used to them being around."
102727,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-10 17:52:00,115,"Well, i have 3 price quotes, two are similar at around $115 plus that BST err, i mean GST. one was for $340 but gives you a perimeter shooting and 6 month warranty. The first two are big major companies, they offer a 2 month warranty but the 3 rd guy told me to make sure what those warranties actually cover for that price. The wife wants em gone, i want em gone even though they don't bother me, they are right above my front door and mailbox which could become problematic to visitors or else i would just let them live. Brandon is in the profession and helped me out greatly, thanks Brandon!! i still want to hear back from you via the pm i just sent you.  here's hoping to being BBBBBBBBBBBusy doing other things this weekend instead of worrying about these b's"
102733,Headhunter,2007-08-10 18:09:00,5703,"Actually Roy, I was quite content to leave them alone or should I say, I didn't even know they were there until I got stung just walking past the nest! I can't recall the last time I was stung, until this recent episode, but with small kids and a family friend who's extremely allergic to stings, I felt I had to get rid of them. Sure is a lot of fun whackin them with the electric swatter though... guys gotta get his yaw yaws out some how! HH"
102734,Garyv,2007-08-10 18:10:00,547,"Here's one ( around 20"" across ) I cleaned out in 2005.  Waited until dark, opened door to shed, sprayed  ( saturated nest ) with a can of killer removed nest after a while and burned it.  They never came back.  Cost about $6.00 for a can of spray.  "
102745,aplumma,2007-08-10 19:10:00,6896,Funny how this subject came up just as I finished finding a nest of ground hornets over by the Goats watering tub. I was washing out the tub getting rid of the leaves and stuff when the water I dumped out ran across the ground and rattled the little buggers up. I am now have 5 stings with sting eze on them and 2 benadril to keep the puffyness down. It is a shame they did not build their nest alittle deeper into the woods because they are in the area the dogs can get to. I guess I have a little project to do this evening with the garden hose.   Art
102758,bigfish1965,2007-08-10 19:28:00,3382,"They go after my dogs, Roy, which is why I had to eradicate them. The golden swells up bad from the stings."
102760,jedimaster,2007-08-10 19:32:00,3472,"I had a 2 and a half foot long nest in my attic a few years back. I had the pest control guys come, the removed gthe nest and killed the residual ones for 100 bucks. Saved me from getting stung."
102761,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-10 19:36:00,115,"The ORKIN MAN  is coming at 5 pm today!!!! If i could have got to the nest i would have killed them myself but seeing as it is not accesible, instead of me spending 30 bucks on sprays and killing a few workers and not accomplishing anything i decided to go the pro way! I will post results later  Plumma, i hope you are feeling better!! Gary, that is a huge nest!!!"
102765,pigeonfisher,2007-08-10 19:51:00,696,"I had to take the father in law to the hospital a few weekends back due to his reaction to a sting.  We were told to leave the nests up as the little fellas are territorial and another set won't build within 100' of an existing nest.  I don't know if that is true, I do however know that the in laws went out and bought some fake nests as well.  My Father in law was damn near hallucinating from his bites...Cooper got two bites from the same nest though, he had no reaction at all.  DANG"
102766,pikehunter,2007-08-10 19:59:00,1659,"  This is the stuff you asked about. Picked it up at Walmart, I think, or maybe the Home Depot? The price was about $8 or $9. Comes with a wand to spray it into tight spots.  Good luck on eradicating the pests."
102767,brandon,2007-08-10 20:02:00,857,"PF is right.....some stores sell phony nests to hang up near existing ones and hope that the wasps move out of the area......I've heard these fake nests dont work at all and leaving the existing one, after treatment, hanging in the tree still is the best thing to do"
102802,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-10 23:32:00,115,"The orkin man was a nice guy and did a great job!! so far so good, nothing going in, will check on it periodically over next day or two but i think the yj's have bit the dust, literally!!  Thanks for all the input fellas, and especially to you Brandon!!   John"
102803,brandon,2007-08-10 23:43:00,857,Hopefully that will be the end of your problem
