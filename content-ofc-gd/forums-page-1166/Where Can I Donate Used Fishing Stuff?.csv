A lot of it has been dollar store discount stuff that will not see water if I keep it.  Is there anywhere I can donate this?  I remember seeing Bass Pro having a deal where you donate old reels for a rebate on a new reel, but I don't think that applied to things like lures, which is what I have the most of."
