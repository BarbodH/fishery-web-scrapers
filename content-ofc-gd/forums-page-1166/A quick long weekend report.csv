102249,Joey,2007-08-09 00:08:00,9122,"Paul and I decided we needed to get out of the city for the long weekend.  Up and out of bed at 4 a.m. on Saturday morning made the drive up there much more pleasurable than leaving with all the traffic on Friday night.  We got to Lakair before noon and set up camp.  The whole campsite was full and all cottages were booked, so we found a spot to pitch our tent and gazebo and launched the boat.    We musky fished all day in the sun and heat and pickerel fished at night.  No musky this weekend but we caught some pike and two pickerel.  I didn't bother taking any pike pictures.  We did have a very friendly encounter with a heron who proceeded to hang out about 3 feet from the boat while we were anchored pickerel fishing and waited patiently for my rock bass cast offs.  He ate well that night and gave me some great photo opportunities.  Here's some of the weekend pictures including a delicious BBQ'd dinner and some gorgeous sunsets.  Enjoy                  "
