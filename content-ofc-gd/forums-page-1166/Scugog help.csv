I would targetting bass and muskie in my 14ft tinny. How does the weed situation look like right now over there? any chance of me hooking into some bass or my first muskie ever?  i usually head over to pigeon lake/kawwarthas, boq or cooks.  thanks"
102214,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-08 21:46:00,1351,"oh, and any tips on where to launch/park?"
102218,misfish,2007-08-08 21:57:00,29133,"Kevin if I knew ,I would help ya out bud.Im heading there in 3 weeks.  Studying them pics from past posts,hit the pads and use that pink thing bud."
102228,mcallister.grant,2007-08-08 22:45:00,327,"Hey Kevin,  I believe if you head straight up Simcoe St. in Oshawa you will reach Scugog. You will come to the waterfront where I am sure there are a few public launches. Hope that helps!  G"
102234,Zamboni,2007-08-08 23:03:00,235,"If you launch at Cesarea you have a lot of choices to fish the east side of the lake....you can go right towards the Scugog river-straight across to sand bar and bay just left of it or where many go, directly left, can work that shoreline and all way back to slop at causeway.  Pm'd you."
102247,Bly,2007-08-08 23:56:00,1556,"Hey Kevin!  Haven't been to Scugog much this year but when I was there, the weeds were as bad as ever.  Personally haven't had much success there but then I am usually on shore.  If you want to launch in Port Perry, there is a municipal boat launch at the end of Old Rail Ln .  $5.00 parking fee for trailers for the day.   Best of luck to you!!  "
102256,mikeymikey,2007-08-09 00:24:00,376,Check out the map using Google map.  Google now has higher resolution image of entire lake (almost).
102265,jedimaster,2007-08-09 00:47:00,3472,"still looking for fish, but you want want to launch at cesarea not in town, it'll be a rough ride getting through the weeds and your gonna want to go up top anyway. Try the river for bass thats what I have heard anyway. I haven't been up there though."
