101803,verno,2007-08-07 22:51:00,178,"Havent had much time for fishing.  The missus was carrying our second child and she was past due and uncomfortable.  We made it the whole 9 months without finding out what flavour the new baby was going to be.  And finally on Monday morning he arrived, kicking and screaming. 9 lb 14 ozs and 27 inches long we got to meet our new son.  His big brother is all over him and loves holding him and singing to him.  I told the boy that since he's a big brother now, he's not a little boy anymore, he's now a mancub. Here's a pic of the crew.  My wife hates the picture but I can't think of a time when she's been more beautiful  "
