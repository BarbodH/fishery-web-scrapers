102143,LeXXington,2007-08-08 16:53:00,1928,"  Yeap mine is doing the same, Loaded firefox and all is well so its a IE issue, Cleared cache and cookies. same problem.. Going to tinker for a while until I can find the setting.  Rick any idea?"

102159,misfish,2007-08-08 17:58:00,29133,"Mine was grey yesturday and looked refreshing,now Im back to brown/green."
102161,Roy,2007-08-08 18:17:00,13728,Rick is working on a new duct tape skin. It'll be Red Green.
102168,English,2007-08-08 18:54:00,90,"Every thing back to normal here in blighty as well, was starting to get used to the blue grey thing but then I have only been a member for a month or so.  Regards Clive"
102171,misfish,2007-08-08 19:05:00,29133,"  Now yer talk,n me buds."
102195,Steve,2007-08-08 20:43:00,2075,"my computer at work has the exact same problem as hooked. only shows the first four threads, and only shows the first two replies on a thread."
102196,Shelley Cooper,2007-08-08 20:52:00,394,"I had the same problem... yet, Chuck's computer never changed....  Its all back to normal for me now... Thank god...lol"
102232,bigfish1965,2007-08-08 22:58:00,3382,"It is really hard to find a server issue that only affects certain computers...very hard. This issue is cross-browser and affects only about 3% of users. We know it is because some computers are running something slightly different like maybe older java or something... But everything we coded and everything we bought should be degradable to about 2001. Knowing that people can use a different computer in the same house and have different results is baffling. I could not come up with a single thing that can create this which is why I gave up and passed it on to the experts. So far they are stumped too. If I could get the error here it would help alot, but its running fine for me. Anyone withthe problem and some web experience that can copy me any java errors or even the page source code I would appreciate it."
102315,Hooked,2007-08-09 04:21:00,891," I'll see what I can do Rick.  I did notice a strange line of code on the page today, in which I'll see if I can recreate it Thursday and copy you on it.  I upgraded to IE7 at work, no change.  Fuzz.  Even when the boards default skin changed back to normal.  I edited my controls to view 20 posts per page....no change.  Hmmm.  Admit it Rick, you love these kind of issues."
102334,Fisherman,2007-08-09 10:19:00,7201,"Ya, mine at work still has the same problem as Hooked and Steve, shows about the first 4 or 5 topics, and then will only go to the first 2 posts to that topic.  Can't get past that and get to reply or any of the other features.  Does it under all the subcategories of Main, classified, help, etc. RRRRRRrrrrr."
102344,Whopper,2007-08-09 11:11:00,2174,Deg asked me to report that he is having the same problem as Hooked and Steve.  Sorry I can't help with this it's way over my head.
102430,Hooked,2007-08-09 16:22:00,891,"Hey Rick, I emailed you the page source code."
101290,Pigeontroller,2007-08-06 14:36:00,2793,I think I'm having a flashback...
101291,Roy,2007-08-06 14:38:00,13728,"What's wrong, Dax?"
101294,Cookslav,2007-08-06 15:03:00,1457,New skin?
101308,Pigeontroller,2007-08-06 16:06:00,2793," Yes, thats what I'm so wittingly refering to..."
101310,mikeh,2007-08-06 16:13:00,824,if you login the background you selected will appear. at least that's how it worked for me
101312,Dano,2007-08-06 16:15:00,719,"It was changed this am for me too, with no input at all."
101315,TJQ,2007-08-06 16:45:00,7806,"Hmmff... dunno... i have mine set for ""club"" thats the brown and green one..  was the same for me today.."
101316,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-06 16:48:00,2585,changed for me this morning.  like a blueish grey  Cheers!
101317,Roy,2007-08-06 16:56:00,13728,Mine was OFC Club before and hasn't changed. Dunno what happened.
101318,Photoz,2007-08-06 16:57:00,792,So o o o  o . . . . .   'ow in 'ell do I get back in familiar surroundings?
101319,Roy,2007-08-06 17:06:00,13728,Very bottom of the page...on the left. Select the skin you want.
101321,douG,2007-08-06 17:25:00,2693,"I gots the same skin I always had.   Pale, pasty, and way too much of it."
101322,Dano,2007-08-06 17:25:00,719,"Hmmm, not the kind of skin I was thinking about Roy...."
101353,pikehunter,2007-08-06 20:10:00,1659,"Dunno, when I first came onto the site the skin was different. Then I signed in, read a PM and all of a sudden the usual skin was back  .  Go figure eh?"
101427,Greencoachdog,2007-08-06 23:23:00,8163,"Don't worry, it's just Daplumma screwin' around with things... tryin' to get his ol' dilapidated piece of crap computer to sign in to this site."
101432,ketchenany,2007-08-06 23:31:00,3229,"I have new ""skin"" too but I haven't shed the old one yet!!!!!  We go out and play and you guys change things, looks good, wait until Lew check in, there will be hell to pay, but it's Ok Roy likes it."
101444,Mike Pike,2007-08-07 00:10:00,1332,"Ya, but where is the ""old skin"" option????"
101450,fishindevil,2007-08-07 00:39:00,6254,WOW....i think it looks great   well done mods.....cheers
101797,camillj,2007-08-07 22:45:00,1988,ok ... I am losing it ... how do I get it back .... I cant find the skins button anywhere
101806,camillj,2007-08-07 22:53:00,1988,All better now ... found it
101820,lew,2007-08-07 23:15:00,12767,"When I'm logged in I've got the OFC club, wwhich I want, but when I log out, it goes to some sickly blue/grey colour.  Never saw this happen before."
101821,solopaddler,2007-08-07 23:17:00,8605, Same here
101973,Hooked,2007-08-08 04:46:00,891,"At home, the new skin loads fine....however, at work, I have to use IE and I can't reply to a thread or send a PM.  Not to mind, I only see the first 4 threads on Genereal Discussion, as well, when I enter a thread I can only view 2 replies to it?  No scroll option.  Haven't had time to troubleshoot but appears to not be loading properly?  Must need an update somewhere?  I'll have to check it out Wednesday when I get time."
101977,bigfish1965,2007-08-08 05:36:00,3382,"There are several skins for the site. A few members were having issues with viewing the site so I simply altered the default setting so that this skin appears to those who have not logged in or set a preference to which skin they wanted. Be nice or I'll unleash the girly skin that I never did get finished. I have yet to hear back if this has fixed their issue. Trying to mail down a problem which is specific to certain computer set-ups and while it has only affected 4 people, I would like to figure it out so I can justify my ridiculous salary here."
102120,Tdel,2007-08-08 15:45:00,393,Seems to be back the way it was before.   For me anyway.  OFC Club when I am not signed in and my chosen skin when I am signed in.  Happy Camper now.  Tom
