Just wondering how many people have done this? Last year I caught a 35"" pike  in the water after throwing the hook it dove into the water and right into my net."
102397,ccmtcanada,2007-08-09 14:57:00,7971,I've had a few get loose from the hook right over the net as well...it's especially nice when it's a toothy critter!!

It climbed out of the net, probably realized it was too hot out and climbed back in again.  While not involving a net, I've had a few bizarre incidents while fishing for steelhead and salmon.  One of which occurred while wading waist deep in the river (about 25ft from shore). While trying to land the fish, the hook pulled out.  The steelhead then swam and beached itself right on shore behind me...I walked back, grabbed it and released it...Not exactly the smartest fish if you ask me.  1hr later, it was caught by another angler further upstream and went home on a stringer.  Apparently it fell victim to a hot pink, ping pong sized roe bag...The water was low and clear."
