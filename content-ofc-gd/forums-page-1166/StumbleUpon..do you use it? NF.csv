101907,danc,2007-08-08 00:57:00,4677,Never heard of it. A little over 3 million users. A drop in the bucket by web standards.
101910,Roy,2007-08-08 00:58:00,13728,I use it but rarely. Can't vote.....nothing matches my situation.
101911,misfish,2007-08-08 00:59:00,29133,StumbleUpon = Ah you mean those new brand of cheap  beers right ????????????LOL
101951,nofrills,2007-08-08 02:41:00,89,I use it once in a while....great add on for firefox!!
101965,Tacklebuster,2007-08-08 03:45:00,303,"never used it or heard of it before, but just checked it out, and I can't see anything out of the ordinary.  I'll just stick with Google, they have bar none the best add on free services."
101988,Rich Clemens,2007-08-08 08:43:00,3131,Never heard of it.
102081,banger,2007-08-08 14:39:00,95,"never heard of it, nor tried it b4.  But here's the link, if any buddy wanta to try it.        http://www.stumbleupon.com/"
102084,bigfish1965,2007-08-08 14:44:00,3382,"It's actually pretty cool for the rainy nights or when you got time to kill in the office. You program what kind of sites you'd like to see then push the button. Sends you to sites that others with similar interests recommended. Just be mindful of what you ask for...certain types of sites are apt to come up more often than others, if you know what I mean...but only if you've asked for it."
102292,mcallister.grant,2007-08-09 01:58:00,327,"I have never heard of it till now. Quite honestly, I think Google is far superior but I will give it a try. It can't hurt!"
