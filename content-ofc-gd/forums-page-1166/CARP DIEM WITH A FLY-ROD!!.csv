102357,RobHall,2007-08-09 12:51:00,261,"I was reading the Ottawa Sun this morning and came across a Jeff Morrison outdoors article.  It has a write up about some guy named Jamie who happens to be an avid Carp Fisherman.  By the time i reached the end of the article and saw a reference to his website, i knew it could only be one person.....Crazyhook.  Congrats CH on tieing the IGFA world record for Carp on a FR.      Too bad about the other Carp.  Link to Sun article  Cheers,  FOTB "
102359,Roy,2007-08-09 12:56:00,13728,"Thanks for the heads up, FOTB. Congrats to you Jamie. Did you check out  the grail blurb at the bottom of the page?"
102361,RobHall,2007-08-09 13:05:00,261, Yes...I got a good chuckle out of that write up.   FOTB 
102505,MJL,2007-08-09 20:47:00,2427,Congrats Crazyhook...Landing a carp that size with light tackle (on a fly no less) is quite an achievement  WTG
102526,Big Cliff,2007-08-09 22:11:00,6899,It always makes me proud when I see an OFC'r getting good press for anything (fishing related is a bonus). I've yet to meet Jamie but I sure am looking forward to it! Good on you young man!
102586,Crazyhook,2007-08-10 01:44:00,1154,Thanks alot guys!

102759,mikeymikey,2007-08-10 19:28:00,376,Does this mean fly fishing is the way to catch those sun bathing group of carps ?  What fly(s) is recommended???
