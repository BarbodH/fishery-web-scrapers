102594,tbayboy,2007-08-10 02:52:00,1497,Hey everyone.  Thinking about setting up a day on Scugog (stupid Muskie fever).  Can anyone recommend a place to rent a tinny from? Preferably one that'll let us keep it out til sundown (say 7:30 or 8pm)?  Cheap would be nice too of course but easy to find and later return time is more important (boat/motor size doesn't matter too much - just 2 of us).  I'm sure I can find some with google but I'm even more sure that the fine folk here can give me some better advise.  Thanks in advance Sean

102653,Bitsmith2k,2007-08-10 12:34:00,396, we've rented from Goerski's before.. not bad for price and a nice clean boat..
102662,ccmtcanada,2007-08-10 12:50:00,7971,Port Perry marina...I've rented there a few times.  Good luck!
102701,tbayboy,2007-08-10 14:53:00,1497,Thanks guys.  Was kinda hoping for something on the other side but putting around the island will work too.
102712,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-10 16:13:00,1351,sorry no clue sean. maybe its time for you to grab a canoe like cliff/carole until you feel like getting a larger boat.. grab a little gas or electric motor on it and you're golden.
102728,tbayboy,2007-08-10 17:55:00,1497,I almost did just that but it was already sold.  Next year for sure - weren't you suppose to be on Scugog today?
102744,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-10 19:00:00,1351,lol. yeah. plans failed for today. and now i won't be heading out for another two weeks. sadly.
