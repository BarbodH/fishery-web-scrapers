The point is to purchase gas which does not contain ethanol, and I am assuming that since all the major suppliers in my area all have ethanol (excluding the premium blends), perhaps the other suppliers will have regular gas without ethanol.  To be more precise, is there any reason not to purchase regular gas from the other suppliers for the boat, or is it all the same except for the ethanol."
102261,Terry,2007-08-09 00:38:00,14456,I don't concern myself with it I don't have a fiberglass gas tank..and a water filter is pretty cheap..so I see no problem it seems to be the gas companies doing most of the b!tching about it
102279,Raf,2007-08-09 01:27:00,3495,"the gas comes from the same place.  you will see imperial, suncor, etc trucks filling the tanks at many independant stations.  ethanol actually increases the octane rating of gasoline.  premium is likely to contain more ethanol.   mix 10% into 89 octane and it becomes 91."

102298,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-09 02:51:00,1351,"i believe shell, the premium or  v power says has 0% enthanol..."
