102160,Douger,2007-08-08 18:04:00,116,"Monday I'm heading to Joyland Beach area on L. Simcoe with the family.  I need some dry firewood and am looking for a recommendation.  Also, how can I tell for sure if it's dry?  Several times in the past I've bought wood that I thought was dry but turned out to be pretty green.  Thanks!"
102162,Roy,2007-08-08 18:19:00,13728,"Pick up a piece...you'll know whether it's green or dry. Sorry, I can't help you with suppliers."
102169,misfish,2007-08-08 19:01:00,29133,"If you are heading up 400 to 11 north,just past the third line of Oro on yer right there is a farm that sells wood and also has the best fresh veggies around.  Hope that helps. Also,if yas want a feed of fresh corn,you,ll see a few peacok corn stands.A must stop and buy.Best darn corn in the area.I just wished someone would sell the old yella sweet corn instead of this peach,s and cream."
102178,Fishnfiend,2007-08-08 19:50:00,357,"Like Roy said, pick it up.  If it seems really heavy, it's either nice hardwood (oak, etc) or it's wet.  Also, sap, etc is a tell-tale that it's green."
102183,Flappn,2007-08-08 19:55:00,245,"Sorry can't tell you were to buy firewood in Orillia, but I can tell you...dry firewood usually takes on a grey ting....meaning it's been sitting for a while. Firewood has to sit for a year minimum for it to be dry and burn well. Also some dry firewood starts to crack...look at the pieces and see if has cracks or is starting to crack. As another person mentioned, it will be lighter than green wood (wet)."
