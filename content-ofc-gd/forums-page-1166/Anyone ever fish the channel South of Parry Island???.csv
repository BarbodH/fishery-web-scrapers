The narrow channels on the south end of Parry Island (just outside of Parry Sound) I believe the name of the road that I take to get into this area is Glen Burney Rd. But i have no idea what the name of this water is, or is it simply reffered to as Georgian Bay water???  Anywyas, Im going up there tomorrow and would REALLY appreciate ANY info you could all share, I havent had any luck in my research and would like SOME info on the waters before heading out there.  Thanks!"
