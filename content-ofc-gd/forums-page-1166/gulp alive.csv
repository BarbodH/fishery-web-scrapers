102456,duber,2007-08-09 17:46:00,220,Yep works well.  Yep containers leak.  Threw a couple to the panfish at the dock and they ate it and did not spit it out.Threw a couple powerbait plastics of the same size and colour in and they ate them rite away but then spit it out.So I figure you will get bit on either but they will hold on the gulp a little longer.  Yep I will buy some more.  Wes
102462,PHISHY!,2007-08-09 18:08:00,24,"Just went out at lunch and bought a couple of buckets to try at the cottage next week.  For those in the KW area, Fishing Fanatics in Waterloo also sells the leeches, minnows and smelts for 26.99 a pail.  Wish me luck!"
102593,Crazyhook,2007-08-10 02:49:00,1154,nice avatar phishy!
102595,mikeymikey,2007-08-10 02:56:00,376,"Are the NEW! 5"" Jumbo Leech available aswell ?  Oh and I guess you could replace the tub with your own if you prefer.  Maybe dunk in other baits and see what happens."
102696,PHISHY!,2007-08-10 14:44:00,24,  Thanks!  Small 28lbs shark I caught off the coast of Cancun last summer.  Hour long fight but well worth it!
102710,rickster,2007-08-10 15:48:00,495,"5"" LEECHES are available but not in the tubs. You can put other gulp products in the tub but they say if you put in any other plastics that the concotion will eat away anything but gulp products"
102753,mikeymikey,2007-08-10 19:23:00,376," Oh really?  I have only seen 3"" leech. who got 5"" Jumbo Leech?"
102773,rickster,2007-08-10 20:26:00,495,"We have the 5"" leeches here at our store come in a bag same as regular gulp stuff come in black and a black with yellow flake"
89462,rickster,2007-06-29 19:37:00,495,"Just wondering if anyone has used it yet Got some of the 3"" leech in the tub and am gonna try it this weekend"
89464,misfish,2007-06-29 19:39:00,29133,"My only advise is,make sure you take it off yer hook when done,unless they have changed thier formula. If it dries on the hook,it dont come off.  Good luck this weekend Rick."
89466,rickster,2007-06-29 19:42:00,495,Made that mistake once already last year.lol Had to cut it off with a knife. This new alive stuff is supposed to be pretty neat stuff. When the leach is starting to shrivel up just pop it back in the formula that is in the tub and it will plump back up to normal. Or so berkley says..lol
89498,mikeymikey,2007-06-29 21:05:00,376,Is Gulp! Alive!  available now?  Does show on BPS.
89501,rickster,2007-06-29 21:10:00,495,"Our supplier just shipped us an order of it We got the leeches but the minnows are still backordered. The 3"" leeches in the tub we are selling for $24.00"
89523,bassman,2007-06-29 22:58:00,384,"It won't be widely available for another 1-2 weeks. You must have connections.  Let us know how they work, I've heard great reports from down south."
89542,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-30 00:47:00,2585,ok why have i nto heard of this yet.  what are there?
101121,mikeymikey,2007-08-05 04:42:00,376,Are these Gulp! Alive! available in stores yet ?
101123,lickmyarmpit,2007-08-05 05:11:00,359,looks as good as the real thing let us know how it works!
101136,Fish Farmer,2007-08-05 11:32:00,2234,Seen it the other day in Fishing World
101224,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-05 23:22:00,1351,seen it at lebarons.. very tempted to try it out.
101225,fishindevil,2007-08-05 23:25:00,6254,"YES it works !!!!!!!   they have it at gagnons sports in oshawa,leeches,smelt,shinners,frogs,  the stuff looks so real its amazing ,and from all the pre-hype and the few people that have used it says it works better than the real thing,  and that all the gulps stay on the hook alot longer i was checking them out today,and i wish that i had all of them for myself,cant wait till i can show some walleyes these great new tubs of gulp minnows.......fish-on.....cheers"
101341,kuhaman,2007-08-06 19:34:00,503,"Petes tackle in St Kitts has a bunch, looks like pretty neat stuff but its about 20 bucks a container."
101944,oncogene,2007-08-08 02:22:00,154,"drove past belleville... saw them for sale in Quinte spots, 2799. I was really tempted to try.. but holded myself off"
102030,ranger520vx,2007-08-08 12:06:00,164,I've been drop shotting Leech and Smelt Minnows and they are awesome. Landed 22 Smallmouth on 1 bait before I had to retire it back into the tub for a recharge.
102032,JerseyDog,2007-08-08 12:16:00,190,I fell it love with the original Gulp when they first came out. Always seems to outfish plastics for me and they are bio-d so they dont pollute.  I can't wait to try this new stuff.
102035,rickster,2007-08-08 12:26:00,495,The stuff is great have been using the leeches and shiners on both walleye and smallies. 24 dollars a tub but well worth it
102037,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-08 12:31:00,115,"One Elite Bassmaster Angler that fished on Erie called that gulp alive, ""crack for bass"". A lot of the pros that fished Buffalo had a jug. I'm sure it works, just like about everything else, i might try a jug on vacation on Rice."
102236,oncogene,2007-08-08 23:10:00,154," wow 22 fish out of 1 bait, that's pretty impressive.  Is the bucket water tight? When I was looking a them in Quine, 1 of the bucket has its inside seal opened (I guess) and the liquid was leaking out of the bucket's lid once I tilted it, it seems."
102252,mikeymikey,2007-08-09 00:19:00,376,     Sure it wasn't your fishing knowledge/ skills that caught all those fish?
102254,mikeymikey,2007-08-09 00:20:00,376,I guess price is very reasonably if you number of bait in container vs. just buying multiple packs of regular Gulp! in a plastic bag.
102303,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-09 03:07:00,1351,I too wonder how tight the lid is on it.. will it leak or crack when it is tighten nice and tight?
102310,Dutch,2007-08-09 03:18:00,831,"Is this stuff the next flying lure, helicoper lure or banjo minnow?  I am going to have to pick some up!  Seriously though, Gulp wasn't any better than the ""Tournament Strength"" power bait line, which wasn't any better than the original power bait line.  Great marketing campaign, especially at $24 a tub.  Fish aren't the only thing that get caught in the sport...IMO."
102353,ranger520vx,2007-08-09 12:07:00,164,Skill and location certainly are factors-but my EXPERIENCE tells me that I've never been hit as hard by Smallies as when I fish Gulp. They just hammer on it. It was part of a 100 hookup morning on a real calm day on Lake erie.
102379,PHISHY!,2007-08-09 14:07:00,24,Just found out that Natural Sports in Kitchener has some Gulp Alive minnows available.
