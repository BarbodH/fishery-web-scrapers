The only problem with Lake Wilcox is lack of shore fishing. The lake is pretty much surrounded by private property and the only spot you can fish is beside the boat house with only one dock. I'm pretty sure the dock area will be empty on weekdays but on weekends, it's pretty much packed till the point where the dock starts sinking down.
