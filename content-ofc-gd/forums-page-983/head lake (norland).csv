237130,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-07 01:19:00,0,"Yep. Really rocky. I lost a few props there. Used to be good Musky fishing but I haven't seen many lately. Maybe I'll give it a shot this fall. There are tons of smallies, some largies and some pickerel. Lake is pretty deep, mostly 20 feet but some places hit close to 30."
