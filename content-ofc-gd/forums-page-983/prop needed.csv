236154,HTHM,2008-08-04 21:23:00,4082,He just rebuilt mine and it is as good as new. He may be able to fix yours.

237012,Aspano,2008-08-06 19:50:00,13,"Busted prop?! How'd you manage that?  I've called around a few places - cheapest I've found is these guys... Ask for Louie when you call. He's got a bunch of Yamaha props used, some new - but not in the box - so they're really inexpensive. He figures $50-$90 range to replace it... If you had the peice, he could fix it right proper. Wanna go back and look?  City Wide Welding Inc 1867 Drew Road, Mississauga, ON L5S 1J5 Telephone : 905-677-0316"

237387,bassfighter,2008-08-07 19:42:00,366,"try Simcoe prop, 905 722 7767 . it is near pefferlaw, beaverton area and on your way to Balsam lake or other Kawarthas lake .  Speak to Doug, tell him joshua refered you to him. Explain the problem and ask for a quote on the phone.  You might be able to drop it off and pick it up at the same time on your way back after fishing one fo the Kawarthas lake. It is his house so you can always pick it up after 8:00pm.  He lives up north away  from the city, his rate got to be good as he works at home and laid back county.  check ebay if you are willing to wait.  Joshua"
