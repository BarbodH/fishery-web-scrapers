236760,oncogene,2008-08-06 00:40:00,154,"For fishing bass with senko, either wacky or weightless texas, assuming other factors being equal, do you guys/gals find any color preference for different time of the day?  say, morning, mid-day/afternoon, evening?   Been trying quite many color of Senko..... but it's really hard to tell if there's any difference at all, when on average I only get a bass every hr or so"
236763,JohnF,2008-08-06 00:43:00,3494, I'm sold on bubblegum pink at 10am on a sunny Sunday morning.  JF
236769,Stoty,2008-08-06 00:55:00,2910,Copper seems to be the overall favorite (no matter what time of day or the conditions) for me. No other colour seems to produce as well.
236811,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-06 02:12:00,2585,"i tend to do well with red shad all day long, watermelon seems to only work for me in the afternoon.  this is jsut based on this years trips so far."
236816,timmeh,2008-08-06 02:29:00,609,I've never noticed any time pattern when using sencos but i've never really tried. I generally stick with natural colours in the brown/green range and that generally works well for me anytime of day. In stained water i sometimes go to a brighter colour - but my experience has admittedly been hit or miss with this. But i primarily fish rivers and smaller lakes from shore so sencos are not usually my first option.
236825,modny,2008-08-06 02:52:00,502,i've been having luck with the pumpkinseed/ chartreuse tip senk's
236848,Tinman,2008-08-06 04:24:00,376,clear ones with the specks in them
236924,Mark Kulik,2008-08-06 14:35:00,348,"I don't have any one fav. color, I choose my stickbait color based on the water color on the lake Im fishing, A lot of it stems from having confidence with that color, I hven't noticed time of day influence my choice."
236949,marcers75,2008-08-06 16:42:00,36,"Since i started using Senko's and quiver sticks this year, I have been going to these colours;  Senkos: Root beer, bubblegum  mizmo Quiver Sticks: Red Shad, watermelon with black and red fleck and a white and chartreuse laminate  Time of day really didn't matter, it all depended on water and what presentation I was using."

236993,oncogene,2008-08-06 18:34:00,154,"Looks like no one feels there's any difference with time of the day wrt color   Just bought myself a pack of bubblegum... of senkos that is. I've read quite a few times ppl saying the bubblegum color is hot. That's kinda an odd color, but I'll see   Too bad the weather doesn't seem to be good... thunderstorm, again!     how do you find the durability of the Mizmo sticks compared to Senkos?"

237023,JoshS,2008-08-06 20:24:00,729,I fuind green pumpkin most productive.
237032,marcers75,2008-08-06 20:56:00,36," Found the Mizmo lasted longer, could be because of the lesser salt content but the senko's had better action.  I use an O ring with my senkos and sticks, it makes them last longer."
