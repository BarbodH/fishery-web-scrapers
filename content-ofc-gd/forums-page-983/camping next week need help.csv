The park has mostly trout species in the lakes and they are down deep this time of the year so you might have problems fishing them effectively. You still should be able to get some smalll brookies fishing Baldhead Creek where it crosses the Mijun Rd

237558,Musky or Specks,2008-08-08 02:05:00,2710,Just a word ask at the park office to talk to someone that fishes see if they can put you onto anything at this time of the year. They have always been very helpful to me when I have questions about certain lakes in the back country. As MuskyMike said the park is worth the trip just for the scenery. Do the hike to Foam Lake. Its a freaking long climb but the veiw is amazing. Same with the hike to the mouth of the Baldhead River.
