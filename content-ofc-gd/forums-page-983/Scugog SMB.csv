236740,forrest,2008-08-06 00:02:00,1032,"After a slow afternoon waiting for the evening to arrive and loosing 2 good fish shortly after the hook-set we finally hooked into a decent fish.  While I was getting us into position with the trolling motor my buddy said ""where is your bobber?"" I felt a tug, set the hook but was confused for about 10 seconds and I reeled in and mistook his bobber for mine.  I thought I hooked up his line.  For 5 full seconds I was thinking?  Why is he pulling so hard if we are snagged up?  On ultra-light tackle and 4lb test I had my hands full with this guy.  He took one BIG vertical jump and at least 3 decent runs and I had acrobatically run to the front of the boat and around to keep him from getting hooked up on the motor and boat.  On the downside I failed to check my line before hooking into another smaller fish that promptly snapped my line after about 30 seconds.  The only other fished I bothered measuring was a 22+ inch SMB and this one....this one is 4lb 6oz.  unknown length, notice the lack of arm stretch/optical illusion."
