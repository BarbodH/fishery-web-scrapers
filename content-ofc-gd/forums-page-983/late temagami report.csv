But why not bored at work and I never post so here we are:  We arrived about 11am, made the drive in about 5.5 hours from Hamilton, couple stops.  Get there and guy tells us that it'd been thunder-storming all night long...grrrreat .  Even later throughout the day we could here the thunder from a distance...not good.  On the water by 11.  10th cast, fish on, pulled in this 2.5lbs pike.  Pulled her in, weighed, took picture, released her.  10th cast I though we were in for some great fishing....HAH.  Didn't catch much the rest of the day, no fish for dinner.  Next day, only a few small bass, no fish for dinner.  Our final day we hiked to a back lake and had a but better luck, couple small pickerel and a decent bass.  Finally a shore lunch - so so tasty.    Overall the trip was a blast.  Seeing we drove all that way, I was really hoping for some monsters or at least some decent numbers... but that didn't stop us from havin a great time.  The lodge was great, very nice owner's (even made a beer run for us while we fished all day sunday  ...always bring extra!...and then backup extra!!).  I would recommend Lake Herridge Lodge to anyone, I'm sure the fishing is a lot better when the weather cooperates.  Pretty cool place, they have 5 back lakes you can hike to and they have boats w motors on all of them.  Sadly that pike on the 10th cast held up all weekend.  Even though the trophy went to its rightful owner (ME hehe ) I can't be too proud of it seeing how it was only 2.5lbs.  But I did outfish everyone so I deserve it in that respect.   Cheers, hopefully next time I have more fish to show!"
