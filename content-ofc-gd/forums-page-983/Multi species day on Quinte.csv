236226,Badger Shark,2008-08-05 00:27:00,291,"Decided to go to Quinte Sunday for a a change of scenery. It was a really nice day down there and different being there when it is warm and not wrapped head to toe in a survival suit.  We ended up catching a niced variety of fish, here are some pics.  Plenty of these    And these     I got a huge hit and a wicked fight and up came this guy      Also caught what I think was a white or striped bass and lots of perch.  Here is a pic of what remains of my brand new reef runner rip-n-stick      Not as big as the monster sheepie I got last fall but one heck of a fight to say the least."
236262,Leecher,2008-08-05 01:24:00,7832,WOW....great job Don     That drum sure is huge  Great report and pics Thanks for sharing Leechman
236265,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-05 01:27:00,0,Very nice! What a massive sheep head! Were all fish caught on that reef runner?
236267,Badger Shark,2008-08-05 01:30:00,291," No we used a variety of cranks, and that sheephead is not even close to the one I caught last fall, here is a pic of that one.    What a fight that one was.  By the way I am 220lbs just to give you an idea of the size"
236268,HTHM,2008-08-05 01:30:00,4082,I did not realize sheephead could get that big! Well done!
236271,jediangler,2008-08-05 01:34:00,1923,"Your fish from last year looks like a grouper, man that's a big sheepie. Tough as a musky on your tackle."
236292,Greencoachdog,2008-08-05 02:00:00,8163,Good report and pics!!!
236294,tbayboy,2008-08-05 02:02:00,1497,"Wow, that is one mutant fish you go there.  Congrats on the wonderful mix of fish, sounds like a great day."
236402,Victor,2008-08-05 12:02:00,1609,"holy crap that's a huge sheep, i have yet to catch one of these yet. Thanks for sharing!"
236408,b2kptbo,2008-08-05 12:15:00,1505,"Good report, sheepies are all muscle..."
236421,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-05 12:36:00,0,"Nice!Was it caught using planner boards, down riggers or long lining? I would love to catch a monster sheep head like that! And what feet of water was it in?"
236430,gdelongchamp,2008-08-05 12:45:00,199,"Nice bunch of fish there badger. Keep it up. I will have to read up on sheephead though, not famililar with them."
236634,Badger Shark,2008-08-05 19:23:00,291," Believe it or not Johnny I was trolling in 18ft of water about 25yrds off shore, no planer, or riggers just about 120ft back at roughly 2mph.  Because it was in shallow water I thought for a moment I had a ski on or a big pike but in the back of my mind I knew it was a sheepie.  The one last fall was in 60ft of water on a planer using a manns +20."
236707,Clampet,2008-08-05 22:43:00,1947,Aye Carumba!
236742,Joey,2008-08-06 00:05:00,9122,"Wow, did the sheephead do that to your lure?  Nice fish porn.  That sheephead is big, but not as massive as that second one you are holding from your other trip.  That's a monster.  Weird head too with beady little eyes  Joey"
236787,Badger Shark,2008-08-06 01:15:00,291," Ya joey it tore up the lure really good, just twistd the crap out of the hooks and as you can see completely ripped the other one out and the worse thing is I just took it out of the package.  Good thing I have way way too much tackle and alot of those types of lures.  HELP ME I AM A JUNKIE I CANT STOP BUYING LURES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have also gone through 4 blue and white origional rapals this season so far, 90% of my fish have been caught on that lure.  I call it OLD FAITHFUL."
236899,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-06 13:09:00,0, Thanks alot! I'm planning a trip very soon! Hopefully I'll catch one too!
