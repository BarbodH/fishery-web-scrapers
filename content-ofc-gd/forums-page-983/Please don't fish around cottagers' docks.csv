237396,modny,2008-08-07 20:01:00,502," ahahah, RIP DIMEBAG       ya no kidding eh. sooner or later i wont be able to even fish. people will be sittin on their docks with rock salt in their shotguns scaring away "" pesky fishermen""    "" hey earl, have u been up north lately?""  "" yea cliff i have, those fisherman are really bad this year eh?""  "" i know i know, there must have been a hatch or something, i had to burn a couple fishtronella candle to stink em outta my area"""
237397,cram,2008-08-07 20:08:00,1733," A few divisive comments about a cottager's right to the water.   Lets be clear....i don't own the water.  I don't own the fish under my dock.  I know that.  What i'm asking is -- please pay me (and others like me) the same respect you would for someone out in their boat.   If you saw someone on their boat fishing, or a boat parked with a family swimming around it, and/or just parked would you troll close by?  Would you stop and cast around them?  I feel the same way about my dock.    Treat me and my dock the same way you'd treat others with tehir boats out on the water.  Keep in mind that i am an AVID fisherman.  I go there primarily to fish....and even though i know that docks are amazing places to fish you'll never find me trolling closely to or casting into someone else's dock.  I feel that strongly about it."
237399,charlesn,2008-08-07 20:27:00,551," That's very different than:   Because if you are fishing on the dock, that's very very different than if you're up in your cottage looking down in an irritated fashion.  Maybe you realized you were wrong to ask what you originally did and have changed your stance.  That's good, because I think 99.9% of the people would be in agreement that fishing a dock that is occupied by an angler is bad form.  But fishing an unoccupied dock in a responsible fashion is totally and completely acceptable.  I would never consider fishing a dock with an angler already on it.  But if you're up in your cottage, then game on.  2 totally different scenarios.  Charles"
237400,Blue_Axela,2008-08-07 20:33:00,88," Does your E-penis feel a little bigger now?  I bet it does.  I am not debating if you can catch bass or not.  Its obvious with your ""I'll do whatever it takes to catch a bass"" attitude, you are able to produce fish.  But I wonder how many kids you had to run over or how many landmines of hooks you had to set up on people's docks, in order to catch that bass."
237405,Roy,2008-08-07 20:42:00,13728,"Cram has made his point. Everything has been said that needs to be said. It appears as though most people are respectful, courteous folks. Let's stop this one now before someone decides to take it to another level...a lower one."
237406,PatrickGG,2008-08-07 20:42:00,562,"OMG! your kidding this is getting out of hand, this thread needs to be removed."
237407,Billy Bob,2008-08-07 20:42:00,5865," I was going to stay out of this heated arguement but after thinking more about it I have a deal for you and all other cottage owners.  If you can guarantee no jet skis or water skiers will ever bother me while I am working a quite bay on Lake X I will never fish another dock again. What do you think, is it a deal  Bob"
237329,modny,2008-08-07 17:15:00,502,  oh for sure. i thought that was already an assumption.  i fill my livewells with carling black label
237332,PatrickGG,2008-08-07 17:21:00,562,I am gonna buy a dock and stick a 100 hp four stroke Merc on the back of it and boot around the lake and watch all the bass boats chase me around.
237334,Blue_Axela,2008-08-07 17:21:00,88,  Your an idiot.  Its probably people like you that caused the OP to start this thread in the first place.
237336,highdrifter,2008-08-07 17:24:00,2534,    Good one brah!  HD
237337,GBW,2008-08-07 17:26:00,8460,"Now you know why I asked the beer question.  It too was taken hook, line and sinker... Micropterus hole, if you see the OPP it's most likely not a random spot check..."
237338,Kirk,2008-08-07 17:27:00,347,"Respectable behaviour...can't get it from someone bankrupt in that area.  Most lakes are big enough that you can fish without the risk of leaving hooks where kids and adults swim, and I expect the same courtesy at my dock from other anglers, works 99% of the time.  The problem is too many monkey see monkey do types on the water that watch Roland Martin, Jimmy Houston and other professionals on TV fishing docks and they go out on weekends to be the wanabee lookalikes.  The pros can usually fish docks with skill, accurate casting etc, not hack thru them with 10 hooks left behind."
237340,highdrifter,2008-08-07 17:30:00,2534," HAHAAH.  May I suggest a little Panthera, or Tool??!  I'd grove to that if you plucked my dock for an hour..  By the way, catchy name, where'd you get the inspiration for something like that?  You got the right dong to fit that yaouge arse?  Just goofing around mang.  teeheeh HD"
237352,Mark Kulik,2008-08-07 17:56:00,348,"Charles brought up a good point-by adding a dock to the water you are changing fish location and behaviour-maybe the real answer is to ban docks altogether, like I said before they are not natural to the lake! cottagers can keep their boats on marine railways on THEIR property-problem solved!"
237353,Cudz,2008-08-07 18:04:00,2652,Wow.  LOL.  I am sure he was kidding.  People need to chill out a bit here.
237358,highdrifter,2008-08-07 18:17:00,2534, True dat.
237384,addy79,2008-08-07 19:22:00,573,  LOL !!
237392,modny,2008-08-07 19:56:00,502,  you are right...  the kind of person that knows where and how to catch big bass.  
237394,GBW,2008-08-07 19:56:00,8460,"I'm sure he was, but I bet there is a bit of truth to the reply as well. I am calm, cool and collected about this whole thread.  Just proving a point that people don't care.  I know someone said it, water on the water, beer on the pier."
237251,Cookslav,2008-08-07 12:57:00,1457," As long as your litteraly willing to swim for its recovery should your line get wrapped up I'd say go for it. But that would make you a better man then most, and I'd applaud you for it.  Unfortunatly I'd bet the farm the majority of Guys saying they fish these docks have never thought of the damage a snaged hook can cause to a childs foot....not to be nasty but hopefully they read this and that little cartoon lightbulb went off. I too get a bit defensive when told I can't fish here, or there, and my rights are questioned. But When It sank in that people swim there it changed my oppinion 100%  Seriously its not worth it. You wouldn't fish an empty Swimming area at dusk or dawn under the same pretence that people ""Swim"" there right? (lot of fish there by the way...churned up bottom=baitfish in spades=predetory fish)  Why put someone at risk over a fish?"
237252,MAzing,2008-08-07 12:57:00,43,"I'm sure someone told you this in the many replys as I couldn't find the time to read that novel.  But you need to get a cottage on a non fishing/boating lake or remove your dock. You may own the land and the dock but the water is there for everyone to use.  Yes there are ignorant people who will not be diligent when doing so but the majority of anglers will stay away from swimmers as well as been carefull of your property.  It's not because you buy a cottage that you can stop people from fishing, yes the other 80% of the lake will have good fishing spots but your dock is one of the better spots on the lake or else no one would fish it.  Best of luck to you and learn to live with others as it's only going to get worse."
237257,modny,2008-08-07 13:23:00,502,I LOVE SNAGGING HOOKS INTO PEOPLES DOCKS
237259,PatrickGG,2008-08-07 13:29:00,562,"  lol, Your a meanie   .."
237261,Greencoachdog,2008-08-07 13:38:00,8163,I really like the way the splashing and screaming of children swimming draws in the hungry Bass and sends them into a feeding frenzy!!!
237262,bushart,2008-08-07 13:41:00,2628,If you love snagging hooks into peoples docks---you may one day get the angler on the dock pitching 1 oz weighted treble hooks into your boat and snagging whatever they can--same distance right??  See how that saying treat people the way you wish to be treated gets it's origin.
237263,rickster,2008-08-07 13:43:00,495,i have read through this post and it seems most are in agreement about not fishing if there are people in or around the dock. here is a question for the few that feel they can fish there whether there is someone on the dock or not if you are sitting in a honey hole and catching fish after fish and a couple of boats come over and anchor beside you and start casting around and under your boat and start plucking the fish out from under your boat would you not tell them that its a big lake go find your own spot??? kinda the same thing here isnt it?
237264,bushart,2008-08-07 13:45:00,2628,Oh sure!!! Apply Logic
237266,rickster,2008-08-07 13:49:00,495,LOL  sorry
237272,glen,2008-08-07 14:00:00,2641,cram the only way you will stop people from fishing around your dock is to remove it.  I am sick of all the docks on the lakes anyway.  There should be a law against docks.
237274,JohnF,2008-08-07 14:09:00,3494," Aw, c'mon. The fish love 'em.  JF"
237275,Garyv,2008-08-07 14:11:00,547,"I can understand your feelings, but being realistic docks do hold fish.  A while back the Ontario Government was going to make it mandatory to have a permit to put a dock in a waterway, not sure if that ever went through. My  suggestion to protect your kids is a couple of cement blocks around your area, some rope going to the surface from them and a floating line with some floats like you see in pools and public beaches to cordon off the area that the kids swim in. Not sure if it's legal but this type of marker is used just about everywhere I see public beaches on inland lakes."
237276,GbayGiant,2008-08-07 14:19:00,1780," No problem. Just turned 13 last week.      And I'm sorry to hear about the one little girl story about cutting her foot, I'm sure it happens every once in a while but.... We have a dock that has at least 5000 lost hooks, jigs, spoons ect.. over the years with cousins, kids, neighbours and many swimmers without one incident of a hook in the body ? I think a simple rock has more potential of causing damage, just what I've seen, do we worry about rocks ? not to mention the washed up broken glass, that's why we wear sandals or water shoes in the water, rocks will do worse damage than anything. Usually when a hook gets snagged/lost it's because the point of the hook is embedded into something already.   Anyway, I'm neutral because I can relate to both sides. Do you even fish ? Like I said I follow certain courtesy but I've seen to many so called asses up here that simply just don't want anyone on the water and it's not because they have kids swimming off the docks."
237180,Cookslav,2008-08-07 03:20:00,1457,"I never fish docks out of respect for the cottagers plain and simple...that and I have Children so I understand 100% were your concern comes from.  Let me pose this question to those who fish the docks. How many of you will get out and remove the hook you snag on a latter, pole, or board on that dock? For those of you that will by all means continue your a good soul For those of you that say screw you its my right to fish any dock I please, and if I get strung up, oh well I got to close... Just think about the kids who swim at that dock, climb those latters, and swim against those poles, and boards...if you have any children or half a heart you may think twice next time.  I personaly know someone whos kid had to get 9 stitches on her little 6 year old foot and almost drown after getting her foot stuck to the side of her Grand parents dock becasue some    felt their rights were more imortant then the property owners saftey.  C'mon guys Its common sence...people, their guests, their children, and their pets SWIM there. There is litteraly so much water out there why not play it safe and think about the other guy?  We're anglers right? One thing that pisses us off more then anything is people not respecting us such as.... Jet ski's that get to close when they have the whole dam lake to use yet they use us as pylons...is this really any different? With so much area to fish, why encroach on the cottage owners... Try putting the shoe on the other foot, and see if you still feel the same?  I know that I'll never do it again because of that little girls ordeal...it opened my eyes for sure. And for the record I am not a cottage owner I just think that fish under the dock is not worth it."
237183,bassman,2008-08-07 03:21:00,384,Throw a piece of chain link fence under your dock. By the end of the season you will have a nice collection of bass lures.
237188,jediangler,2008-08-07 03:33:00,1923,Bassman's got the right idea. I've heard of guys throwing an old box spring weighted by 4 cinder blocks under their dock.
237189,Greencoachdog,2008-08-07 03:33:00,8163,"  Most of the docks around here have Christmas trees concreted into 12"" masonry blocks around here for Crappie structure, they just love to eat those expensive crankbaits!"
237195,Tinman,2008-08-07 03:47:00,376," My uncle did this with an old matress when we were kids on the big rideau! worked like a charm! lol   I agree with this all together, when i was a kid swimming at the cottage, during the old OV pro bass days. I had a fisherman cast and hook the back of my leg while i was out in front of my dock snorkeling, thanks to him i ended up with a few stitches and a tetanus shot. And yes he must have know i was there there were around 8 other kids in the water near me.  If you are respectful of the cottagers then i'm sure there would be no problem.  As for BITE ME, your calling this guy a pot stirrer with a name like that?"
237201,Greencoachdog,2008-08-07 04:20:00,8163,"  Na, Pete (BITEME)is a great guy!... and he and I were just exchanging a little friendly abuse.  He does own a damn ugly straw hat that he has to wear way to often for some reason though...  "
237202,cram,2008-08-07 04:29:00,1733,"What i'm asking is to be a human being and have some decency.   When people are on the dock, why would you troll by?  Or worse, stop and cast.  Or even worse, troll by (and/or cast) when tehre are kids swimming.  Its your right and i can't stop you....but seriously are you proud of that?  There's LOTS of water to fish.  I'm clearly not alone....MANY on this site feel the same way.  So just know when you're fishing off a dock (esp. with people there) that you're likely irritating some people.  I can't blame people on crowded lakes.  When you buy a cottage there, you know what you're getting.  But when the majority of my shoreline is undeveloped.....  GbayGiant....nice of you to call me an jerk.   Are you 12 yrs old?"
237206,Greencoachdog,2008-08-07 05:16:00,8163," Well did you read all the replies or just the negative ones?  I think the board members did very well with a vast majority agreeing with you not to fish docks with people present. I really did expect more negative comments than you actually drew... especially with you being a newbie and nobody actually knowing you.  There are always going to be some negative replies and unfortunately there will be ignorant boat owners that will fish or troll your dock while people are present.  Some fishermen aren't as skilled as others and may not be able to catch decent fish anywhere else but docks.  ... and since we don't know which lake your cottage is on or exactly which cottage it is... you can't really take the replies to this thread too personally... can you?  There's an old saying ""Sticks and stones..."" ... and internet sticks and stones don't pack near the wallop real life ones do... do they?"
237208,cram,2008-08-07 06:08:00,1733, Not at all.  From what i can tell most on the site either agree or at least understand (which i appreciate).   Tone is lost on the internet.
237074,GBW,2008-08-06 23:31:00,8460,"I agree with you on this one.  I will not fish near a dock when there is even a hint of someone being at the cottage.  I've had guys come by so close (with me fishing off the dock with my daughter who is 4) and chuck lures right beside me.  I almost yelled out ""honey get my gun"" but then I tossed a lure and it bounced off the side of the boat they knew I was mad.  No matter what I said (had to be civil with the wee one around) or did these TOOLS still sat there for 5 min.  And they we not 'kids' either."
237075,solopaddler,2008-08-06 23:33:00,8605,"Personally I can't fathom ever doing something like that if I know that I'm bothering or intruding on someone. Conversely I value my own privacy and can't stand fishing amongst others when I have a choice.  If someone's on a spot I want to fish, I'll move on to the next spot on the lake.  If I'm steelheading and there's a bunch of people encroaching on my spot I'll move on and walk another km if I have to.  I don't get peoples mentality sometimes. It's not the fact that you're entitled to fish someones dock. Of course you are. It's the fact that you'd even want to in the first place when it's not necessary in order to catch fish and especially when you're annoying someone and/or intruding on them.  It boils down to respect and common sense. You either have it or you don't..."
237077,Greencoachdog,2008-08-06 23:38:00,8163, 10-4! well said!! just my 2 cents!!!   Imagine whirrled peas!
237080,mikeh,2008-08-06 23:42:00,824,this seems like it really stresses you out. one thing I suggest is when you are there put a couple javex bottles out and maybe make a swimming area.
237091,rhare,2008-08-06 23:57:00,387,"I fish docks often, I love pitching senko's under docks its a great tactic for big bass. That being said I never fish docks where people are on or if people are in there yards. I have never left a snagged bait on a dock or a dock line or anywhere someone might swim.. If someone asks me to leave I apologize and leave. Sometimes its the cottage owners who are rude. Maybe they have had some run ins with some idoits but that doesnt give them the right to cus and throw things in the water.  just my 2 cents"
237096,Clampet,2008-08-07 00:13:00,1947," Ditto! Show some respect. Go fish somewhere else.  If you can't fish without infringing on someone, pack er up and go fer a drive. If you can't find a lake to fish without being up someone's rear-end, then I would consider retiring from the sport. I got too much pride that won't allow me to bother someone just like me who wants to enjoy their week-end."
237099,Mark Kulik,2008-08-07 00:20:00,348,"A public lake with docks is fair game to me I pay my taxes and buy a fishing licence as a tourney angler , you'd be crazy not to fish them-I generally like to fish them early before people come out-I never leave a hook on a rope or stairs and I don't stay for a long peroid-I've had some really nice conversations with cottagers, on a couple of occasions, gave baits, hooks and tips, even had kids come aboard to see the big bass in the well, that being said-A dock is not a natural part of the lake!, many ,especially the million $$$ ones in the Muskokas are total eyesores in my opinion, they are a priveledge! not a right! some cottagers have told people I know to get off their lake! I fish them with lots of courtesy and never when kids or people are swimming."
237101,Cudz,2008-08-07 00:32:00,2652,I fish docks but do it quickly and not if there are any people there. It can be done in a respectful manner.  Why fish docks? Because these live under them. 
237104,Rizzo,2008-08-07 00:39:00,4754,"your lake sounds pretty good, I would like to come fish it! We are fortunate that very few ""strangers"" come on our lake as there is very limited public access (only down a dirt trail or a hike along some train tracks). Although I wouldn't like it if someone fished my dock (because I actually feed bass worms there) I wouldn't do anything about it."
237105,Zamboni,2008-08-07 00:39:00,235,"Not too many people would cast or troll by where kids are swimming.  I move on if its early and a dog starts barking, otherwise the lake is as much mine as the cottage owners and most realize that."
237108,solopaddler,2008-08-07 00:41:00,8605,"I'd like to add, even if a dock was vacant I still wouldn't fish it. I don't like to intrude on other people plain and simple.  Tournament anglers have a completely different mind set.  Each to their own, as I mentioned earlier it's your right. It's definitely not my mind set though."
