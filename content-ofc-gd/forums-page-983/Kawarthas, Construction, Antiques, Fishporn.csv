236578,Reef Runner,2008-08-05 17:55:00,980,"I hope everyone had a safe and eventful weekend.  Plan for the weekend was to build a storage garage for the boats and other misc items.  The foundation and anchor bolts were poured over the winter and delivery of the framing materials was expected Thursday.  My buddy and I headed up Wednesday night so we could account for the materials on Thursday and fish the evening, also, I had planned a day trip to Balsam Lake for Friday.  The meantime saw us waiting for delivery on the deck, sipping on some brewskis and setting up the gear.  Since I was lending my buddy with my spinning outfit I thought I spool up one of my Dad's rods with powerpro for droping senkos.  In the garage, shuffling through his ancient rods and reels, I decided that this would be my pic.  An old St. Croix, which I thought was pretty cool.  I really appreciated the construction of the rod, far left, look at the copper reel seat.  Anybody know what year that was was made?    Waiting for the wood to arrive, I took a couple of test casts with the St. Croix antique across the lawn with a bell sinker and these guys would swoop down and try to snatch my weight.   The wood arrived at 3:30 pm or so, after a Bbq we set out on the boat and took a couple of casts in front of the cottage.  Caught 3 hammerhandle pike that were photo shy, back in the drink and head home to get up bright and early to get to the lock to Balsam for 9am.  Problem with going to Balsam for me is the time the locks open (9am) and close (7pm).  These time dont allow for me to be on the water during primetime, which may explain why I get skunked most outings there.  I tossed spinnerbaits, droped senkos, believers and Maraboos, spoons cranks, nothing.  I really gotta get a system going on the lake for midday fishing that'll put some fish in the boat.  Despite the skunking, the boat ride was beautiful through the locks and waterway.    On the way back to the cottage we stopped at some places on my lake to get that skunk smell out of the boat.  Here's some fish porn from that evening.     Saturday and Sunday were dedicated to putting together the frame for the garage.  I'll spare the details, but it was a good little project at 40' x 30x 12'.     Finshed the frame Sunday before supper.  Aluminium siding and the roof are coming in this weekend, so we'll finish it off then.  That provided the opportunity to fish that evening.  My buddy, thus far, had been getting skunked all weekend and was getting frustrated at this point.  He wasn't doing anything wrong, I told him and I observed, just was javing some bad luck.  Well that evening the tables turned, I got the skunk and he caught the fish, lol.  10inch crappie  Release   Hope y'all enjoyed the report.  Made the most of what time we had on the water and took in some cottage life....wish was up there now.   Cheers,  reefrunner"

236736,Joey,2008-08-05 23:59:00,9122,"Great report.  Nice shed building there.  I love the name of the old St. Croix - The Pacemaker, ha ha ha.  Joey"
236876,Victor,2008-08-06 11:33:00,1609,Great report Reefrunner!  Very nice carpentry with the garage! Please update us with the progress!
236878,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-06 12:13:00,0,Looks like the Garage is coming along just fine. Some nice pike too. I fished that lake and will have a report up next week since my sister took her camera to Sherkston. The fish at Balsam are hiding in deep weedlines during the day. Find the deep weedlines(10+) and you will find the fish. Thanks for sharing.
236894,Reef Runner,2008-08-06 12:58:00,980,"Thanks for all the replies.  I had considered camping on Balsam for the evening, however, the garage took priority and I really couldn't stay the night.  Sounds like a good trip for another time.  How'd ya make out there JohnnyBass?  Like I said I had limited time on the water but I was looking out for ya when I was.  I too love the name ""pacemaker"", lol."
236902,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-06 13:18:00,0," Well, I missed the morning and the evening bite so I concentrated on mostly deep water. Plus I didn't want to use up my trolling motor battery too much. Did a lot of drifting. Fishing was ok.Caught a pike about every 1/2 hour. Biggest was 28 inches and chunky. Was tossing around a very large spinner bait. Still didn't keep the small pike away.lol Tried fishing the weed pockets for bass with a jig and pig but only moved one largie. Will post the report next week.  My first time on the lake in a boat and I learned a few things. Next time I will fish it much differently and concentrate on the skinny water."
236907,Reef Runner,2008-08-06 13:32:00,980,"Good stuff Johnny.  Lots of hammerhandles in there, lol.  Glad you tied into a nice one at 28inches.  Bass are few and far between this year I've noticed."
237078,moparhawk,2008-08-06 23:38:00,146,"nice shed, no wind bracing?"
