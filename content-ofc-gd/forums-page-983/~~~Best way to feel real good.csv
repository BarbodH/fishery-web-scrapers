By following simple advice heard on the Dr. Phil show, you too can find inner peace.  Dr Phil proclaimed, ""The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have started and have never finished.""  So, I looked around my house to see all the things I started and hadn't finished, and before leaving the house this morning, I finished off a bottle of Merlot, a bottle of Zinfandel, a bottle of Bailey's Irish Cream, a bottle of Kahlua, a package of Oreos, the remainder of my old Prozac prescription, the rest of the cheesecake, some Doritos, and a box of chocolates and the rest of my half-gallon of Blue Bell Original Vanilla Bean ice-cream.  You have no idea how freaking good I feel right now."
