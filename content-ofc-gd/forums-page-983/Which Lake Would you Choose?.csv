237401,Andy,2008-08-07 20:34:00,330,"I have a chance to go fishing Friday to Sunday with a friend who has never fished the Kawarthas. I've fished Pigeon with mixed results, fishing mainly the north end. Good numbers of bass, a few pickeral, and a musky or two. (I'm likely the worlds worst musky fisherman.) I've never been to Stony. My friend is mainly a pickeral guy who jigs the shoals on Nipissing alot. That being said, we have the gear to fish for all species. I have GPS maps for both. Which lake would you prefer to spend a weekend at? Thx. Andy"

237464,Mr. Follow,2008-08-07 23:37:00,34,I'd fish Stoney. I've fished Stoney many times During my early years as a musky hunter. Great fishery any time of year.
