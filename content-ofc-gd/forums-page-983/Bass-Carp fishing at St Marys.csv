237168,Marko,2008-08-07 02:47:00,854,"Decided to leave work a little bit earlier today, was tempted by the sun and the blue skies. E-mailed John and asked him how rivers were and he told me that they should be good to go. I was telling my friend, that was with me, how much fun it is to chase carp in shallow rapids especially when you can see them take your bait. I hoped that was going to be the case today. River was a little bit high but you still could see them swim around in couple of different pools. In the very first pool i get this little guy.  Two casts later, fish on and the line snaps, so i am thinking it happens what can you do. Couple of more casts later fish on, spits the hook, i am shaking my head thinking its going to be one of those days. I see two fish swimming around, cast couple of feet in front of them and one of them hits it, it starts peeling my line and SNAP, line snaps again. Now i am ticked off. Decide to go to a different pool, give fish a chance to settle down a little bit. Put a worm on to try to get some bass. First one of the day  Same pool cast again, this little guy hits.  So i am thinking this is working out somewhat better then carp fishing. Couple of more casts another one  I am thinking I pulled enough from this pool and off i went to another pool. First cast and this guy hits it  Meanwhile my friend isn't catching anything nor is he getting any hits so we decide to go to a pool where we saw bunch of carp swimming around Couple casts in and he hooks into his first fish   Not even 5 minutes have gone buy and he is hooked into his second fish of the day. This is him trying to chase it down, left the net in the trunk lol.  This is the fish.  Meanwhile i was trying to clean the pool of smallies and they weren't shy.  They were not very big but sure do put up a great fight. Couple of more i got in the same hole.   This guy had some scratches on its side, not really sure where they came from.  Now it was my turn to try and catch some carp. Went to my car and change my spinning reel, my line kept on snapping for some reason. Its really weird because i had used that reel couple of days ago and it was alright and today even the slightest thug on it made it break. Any who, it wasn't too long before i hooked into a carp Little baby  Slightly bigger one  and me fighting it   And my friend not to be outdone, he catches one more   I also ended up catching couple of rock bass and one really big sucker. Caught couple of more bass and couple of more carp but didn't take pics, my battery was running really low. All in all a really good day"
