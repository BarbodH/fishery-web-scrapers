Select the e-mail tab, and it gives you the choice to select and resize a whole folder of photos in one shot! Makes it way easier to e-mail and keeps the file size down from al these high megapixel cameras we have today. Just e-mail them to yourself, and you have them in a smaller file size version. Great for posting here!  Is there an easier way? Like I said, I may be a little ""slow on the uptake"" when it comes to this computer geek stuff, but I was thrilled!"

Right click on the image u want re-sized and just select the size of the copy. Fairly simple."
236922,Stoty,2008-08-06 14:28:00,2910,"If you have a newer version of Photoshop (CS, CS2, CS3), it has a batch option to resize folders of photos at once."
236931,douG,2008-08-06 15:33:00,2693,"I use Fotosizer, a highly rated freeware program that will do batch resizes (many photos with the same command).  Take a look."

237015,Greencoachdog,2008-08-06 19:58:00,8163,"If you host your pics on photobucket, it resizes them for you when you upload.  I can also resize pics right on my Sony camera without ever having to even put them on the puter.  I'm sure there's a shipload of ways to do it... but what ever works best for you is the way to go!   btw... is that eggs in your beard RT2?"
