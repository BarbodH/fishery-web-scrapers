236704,forrest,2008-08-05 22:37:00,1032,"I currently have a few spinning reel setups and need to improve on the ultralight -> light tackle.  The issue with my current setup is that it takes 4 or 5 turns to take up line slack before I can use the rod to dig the hook in.  So, I think what I am looking for is reel with high gear ratio, fat spool and 7oz, or so, and less, and, of course a smooth drag and easy bail roll over. Any good ideas on how I can improve my setup (new reel for now)?  forrest"
236724,Canuck2fan,2008-08-05 23:34:00,1444,I think you will most spinning reels these days have a 5.2 to 1 ratio.  However a lot of the taking up line slack is done by the rod as you are reeling too.... longer the rod the faster the uptake of the line. I tend to lift the rod as I am reeling then when I feel tension I set the hook.
236822,forrest,2008-08-06 02:45:00,1032," I am doing that but its taking a lot longer than I would like.  A longer rod is in the plans but I was hoping to get another foot or two more from a big spool or a quantum baitcaster ""burner"" (7:1) type spinning reel.  forrest"
236851,jace,2008-08-06 04:42:00,472,"    That's the biggest problem with the micro light sized spinning reels the spool size is no good regardless of what gear ratio you have.  100:1 around a spool the size of a thimble will still only take in a foot of line.   Just how small is your reel?   If you're looking for a small reel but not necessarily a  ""ultralight"" by classic definitions, look into the US Reel  supercasters.   They're small lightweight reels with near normal sized spools.  I think the price range is about $80 - 150 but i could be off on the top end.  I saw them when they first came out.  They're definitely cool and built with a purpose."
236861,Greencoachdog,2008-08-06 09:30:00,8163,"I'd say spool and rod size are probably your problem as well, you may want to step to a 7' UL rod with a 2500 size reel... still small and light, but a little bigger."
236862,singingdog,2008-08-06 09:45:00,1047,"Don't get sucked into the gear ratio hype....the only stat that matters is how much line the reel takes up with one turn of the handle. Having said that, any larger spool spinning reel will give you faster line take-up than a small spool UL reel."
