During mid day when the bite was slowing down I started targeting panfish for fun. Next thing I know I feel a big hit and set the hook. I knew I had something big on and it did a leap out of the water and it was a smallie. Since I was using my ultralight it gave up a pretty good fight, after a few mins I was able to land him. We also saw a small painted turtle sunning himself on a lily pad. It was a good day on the water since weather forecasted rain but we didn't get any until we left for home.   "
