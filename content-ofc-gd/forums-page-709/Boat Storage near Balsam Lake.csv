447450,fish_d00d,2010-03-24 03:38:00,38,"Hi, was wondering if anyone could recommend a place to store a boat near Balsam Lake - preferably South of the lake, along Hwy 35 or Hwy 8.  Thanks!"
447504,lew,2010-03-24 11:09:00,12766,"Check with some of the local farmers in the area, alot of them offer storage spaces at very reasonable prices for both inside and outside storage.  I've stored my boat inside a barn the last 9 winters for only $150 for the entire winter."
447514,fish_d00d,2010-03-24 12:07:00,38," Thanks for the tip, lew. I have seen those signs when driving to those lakes up North, but never thought to write any numbers down. Now, I have a boat, and I'm kicking myself.  I've tried searching the Internet for them too, but I guess they're not online. I guess that's just an excuse to drive up there and fish."
447596,fishermccann,2010-03-24 14:59:00,655,"Lots in Rosedale, on the east side of balsam."
447766,fish_d00d,2010-03-24 22:21:00,38,"Thanks. I searched Rosedale and got in contact with Fenelon Falls. Their rates are not bad...  However, I just thought of a great idea ... use Google St View!! Now I'll be able to see all those signs I usually miss when driving up North."
447835,GBW,2010-03-25 01:13:00,8460,"do you have enough space to put of an outdoor garage made of canvas over the boat on your land?  If so, it costs a lot less to get one of those and a tarp or two vs. paying for wrap every year and storage fee's."
447883,fish_d00d,2010-03-25 02:22:00,38," Believe me, if I had the space on my driveway (which I share w/ my neighbor), I would do that in a heartbeat. This is the reason why I initially bought a car-topper Jon boat - my limited space. Over the winter I decided to eat storage fees and found a good deal on a bass boat... which lead to my predicament.  No worries, though, I found a place today to store the boat for a good price, in close range to a number of launches near Balsam.  Thanks again for the replies!!  Btw, be sure not to underestimate (or mis-underestimate ) how useful Google St View could be. Very handy in finding ads/signage you fleetingly view when driving."
