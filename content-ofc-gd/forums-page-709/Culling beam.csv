It seems that if the fish were moving around it would affect the reading on them....   Any input appreciated, thanks !"

447389,uglyfish,2010-03-24 02:08:00,981,"wayne's correct! its a very valuable tool when culling similar sized fish. a scale is unreliable in rough water. and to weigh 2 fish can be time consuming, where as taking 2 fish and putting them on the beam takes a second.  time in everything in a tourney!! if i spent less time catching muskies when i fish with wayne in tournies we'd have time to catch that 5th bass or kicker fish we need... lol"

A little tip we do is whenyou have 2 wells, or a divider, put the bigguns on one side and the smallest fish.  Leave the other side for the average fish.  Makes it easier to cull when need be.  Happiness is having a 3lber in the larger side of the live well as the small fish.  Tis a good day then!  When we used to do the perch/crappie events the beams were invaluable."
