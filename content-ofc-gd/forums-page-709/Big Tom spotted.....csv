447758,irishfield,2010-03-24 22:03:00,26272,Couldn't resist!!.. although I couldn't find the big bird costume...  some interesting movement in the other shots. Knew there were some 80 lb 'yotes around... and the real curious guy right up to the lense...
447777,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-24 23:09:00,348,I thought it was pretty funny. I will be interesting to see over the next while what's gonna be around....those two yotes aren't gonna help things
