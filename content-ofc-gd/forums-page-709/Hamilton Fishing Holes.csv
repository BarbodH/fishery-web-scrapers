I've been out to Burlington Bay, Desjardins Canal, and the lift bridge.............Not even a bite, im gonna try some with minnows this week and maybe hook into some perch. I dont really care what I catch just, I just like to get out. Suprisingly I was using worms and didn't even land one goobie. Kinda sad how they have taken over a once very fun to fish harbour."

They are listed in the Telephone Book.  Second you have the Bay...Behind Hutch's on Bay Street etc. and anywhere on the Burlington side, off of King's Road, like behind the Cemetery or around the Boat Club.  Next you have Cootes Paradise in and around Dundas or Longwood Road or near the High Level Bridge...  Finally you have the Canal on the Beach Strip around the Lift Bridge.  Go Fish!!!"
