448082,streamerstripper,2010-03-25 19:10:00,28,"Hey everyone,  Just thought I'd introduce myself.  Moving to Hamilton area in May from BC (by way of a few yrs in Utah) and looking forward to the angling opportunities.  Love to throw (and tie) flies - fished steel/trout/salmon back home and all sorts of trout in Utah.  Hoping to meet a few of you this summer and get out on the water."

448207,spincast,2010-03-25 23:50:00,3279,welcome to Ontario. Fishing's great - but I bet your horizon will take bit to get used to. I moved here from the appalachians (another great trout place) looooong time ago. Took a while to not having a mountain as a horizon!
448211,douG,2010-03-25 23:54:00,2693,"The mountains are nice, bu they sure do block the view."
448225,Spiel,2010-03-26 00:13:00,9065,"Always room for another fly tier on the forum and in Hamilton, welcome aboard."
448264,smitter,2010-03-26 01:21:00,106,"Welcome to the forum!  I used to live in Hamilton, if you like trout fishing, the Grand River is where you want to be. There's tones of articles about it in The Canadian Fly Fisher Magazine."
