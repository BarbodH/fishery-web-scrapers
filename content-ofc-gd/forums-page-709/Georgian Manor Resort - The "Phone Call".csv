They called me and said ""I won"" blah blah.  Well, it's pretty much what you think it is.  Do some research on the net and you will see.  http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g181754-d182829-r2602278-Georgian_Manor_Resort-Collingwood_Ontario.html  Just wanted to post something because I am sure I am not the only one.  Cheers."

My wife signed us up for the ""Welcome Wagon"" when we moved to Barrie. yipes. I had calls and e-mails for months from people wanting to sell us stuff (with a discount of course) to welcome us to the city. Thanks for nothing"
447395,bigugli,2010-03-24 02:12:00,6138,"IF there was a ballot, my wife would fill it. After the 2 spring show I figure she must have entered some 50 odd ""free"" draws with ""great"" prizes."

447576,mikethespike,2010-03-24 14:11:00,51,"ya they tried to pull the same thing on me last year after my wife filled up some ballots @ the boat and fishing show.  they tried @ least 4 times and i had the same reply to each call which lasted less than a minute each:  nope, we are not interested.  you don't want your prize? absolutely not. why did we fill out the ballots?  we had nothing better to do @ the time. goodbye."
