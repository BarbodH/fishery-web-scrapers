442801,rbaquial,2010-03-12 02:27:00,968,...is that Savagear stuff really not all that good? Do you REALLY think I paid full price for that?! :@ As Wayne Brady would say: do I have to choke a *****?! :@  .... I'm heading there tomorrow anyway. so...  EDIT: I didn't realize this topic would cause such a stir!
442804,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-12 02:37:00,3761,cheap baits don't produce fish i guess...just look at the dollerama tourny..
442807,rbaquial,2010-03-12 02:44:00,968,.........MTBF............. The Dolla-Rama Tourny..... fish were caught? weren't they?
442810,mikeh,2010-03-12 02:55:00,824,"I was at Bass Pro tonight and picked up one of those savgagegear jointed baits, and a glide bait . The jointed ones seem a little small though but the glide baits are ok . If I were you I'd buy two M&G musky spinnerbaits , one black/chartruese and black/orange. Lebaron's sells them cheaper so take a copy off the website or take a lebaron's catalog and they may do a price match. Also pick up some Mustad 8/0 treble hooks,some split rings  and I'll pm you how I modify the spinnerbaits.  Knipex cutters are nice when cutting hooks to save the fish from possibly dying."
442811,rbaquial,2010-03-12 02:58:00,968,"  Yeah, I'm going back there tomorrow... How many of the savagear's did you see left? Last I was there... I saw maybe 12-14 lures left...."
442816,mikeh,2010-03-12 03:12:00,824,"there was around 20 left ,but was told they have more in the back. I bought the firetiger jointed one and the 'jack' glide bait. I think to jointed ones are a little small as a big fish would probably swallow the bait and make it difficult to get out. If it was me I'd return some of the jointed ones you bought and buy a grandma or jake (firetiger or perch color)or a double d bait (10 inch baits).  I'd also recommend a topwater prop bait of some kind.  my list would include  knipex cutters 2 spinner baits M&G's glide bait topwater prop bait 10"" grandma or jake for trolling"

I haven't used teh gliden raps, but the gusy at in-fisherman rave about them for pike and musky.  SXR-14 is a good early season musky lure and big pike gobble em' up, I think you will be happy Dirk."

443267,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-13 09:19:00,158,"One reason i am advocate of x-rap (even though they are cheaply made) is they are easy to work. One of the easiest jerkbaits out there to work.  I do want to try out the max-rap this season and the husky jerk is also great.  X-raps seems to work no matter how fast or slow you work them.  I have trolled them, ripped them in super fast and also caught fish on super long death pauses.  I have caught musky, northerns, bass, and walleye on them, and i here guye nail trout and salmon on them too.  Once the water warms up though, i move on to bigger jerks for musky.   Just be prepared to break lots."
447684,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-24 18:48:00,1362,I just got my new St. Clair Hound bucktails delivered to me   ........these are most solid in-line bucktail baits I've come across...   I'm just chomping at the bit for Muskie opener to get here!!!!!     
442107,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-10 08:33:00,158,"Lipdip and harrison, i couldn't agree more with everything you said except for 2 minor things.  Some guys still swear by shorter rods, especially for jerkbaits and WTD topwater and the wire/flouro debate has some merrit.  Harrison I saw guiding a couple of guys last summer on LOTW and we same something similar happen.  I had them casting a shoreline in a small bay.  It was a calm, lazy type of afternoon and the bite had slowed down big time from the morning.  I was half asleep as i was enjoying the sun and working the 9.9 kicker by popping in and out of gear to slowly cruise the shoreline.  the guys asked me if i knew foresure that there were musky in this bay.  Shortly after that I happened to glance over my shoulder and a mid forties was wollowing the prop of the kicker, liek a foot away. I turned to the guys and calmly said ""yeap, check this out.""  It followed for another 15-20 feet untill I took the motor out of gear and it swam under the boat and then looped around and swam back out from the back.  It was memerized by the fourstoke just chugging along at idle is my only guess.   We casted the hell out of the area and it didn't show itself again. Pretty cool though."
442134,LipDip,2010-03-10 13:39:00,39,"Wire vs. Fluro isn't a debate. That's my point. There are guys who use and swear by one or both. There's a guy from the OTT R area on this board who uses nothing but fluoro and has done reasonably well lol. Other guys like using wire. You will get sound, reasonable advice from both, on both products. The fact they're using what they've ran up crazy track records using is what's important, not whether it's wire, fluoro, cat gut, nylon, a d-string etc  etc etc. For anyone who likes casting, figure 8ing and keeping fish hooked with stubby rods, all I ask is try a long rod for your jerkbaits for just a wknd. Do 50 figure8's on 50 back-to-back casts each with a 6'9 and then with an 8'0. Do them right. Big and deep. How's your back feel? Still want to make good figure8's all day with the short rod? The facts are that long rods cast father, hit harder, figure8 easier and reduce the workload dramatically.  If these are three trade-offs you can swallow, try using a long rod. The number of companies still pushing poolcue rods suggests to me that once guys try a longer rod they never go back. It's one of those rare trends in fishing that makes good mechanical sense. I throw a lot of Suicks, Wades, Bobbies, Bulldawgs and would definitely say that jerkbaits are one of my confidence baits. I also use a lot of Grandmas, Jakes, Shallow Invaders, DD's, DDD's, and stuff. The long rods made using them easier for me, definitely give it a try if you get a chance. You sure don't need much effort to sweep/jerk a Suick around using the 8'6. You can start your turn/boatside moves a lot farther out too! I've got 2x 6'9 Premiers, 2x 7'2 Premiers that I've caught a lot of fish on. They've been bundled in the rafters of my garage for about five years now. They're great rods. Just that once I started using 8'6s, I literally had no use for them. They look and feel like an icefishing rod to me. Just way too much work for me to use. These days, my 7'6s are my stubbies, a pain to figure8 and cast with after going to long rods lol. Use what you like, but definitely try a long rod this season. They're widely available, because lots of muskie cuctomers are demanding them. Some guys are using 10'0s too."
442147,Tom McCutcheon,2010-03-10 14:29:00,627,"Sage advise from LipDip, and a number of others, including ""Believer Ron"". Leave the gaf at home unless you are experienced enough to use it without killing the fish. (very few are).  Tom."
442459,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-11 08:15:00,158,"LIPDIP, I use 8'6"" rods myslef and I use both flouro and wire leaders. I agree with you 100%, but i also think its a matter of personal preference, hence why it is debatable.  I have been trying to sell my 6'10"" for a while now actually."
442472,outllaw,2010-03-11 11:42:00,1232,"my best thoughts for musky must haves. all release equipment. a decent soft tip trolling rod.AND knowing where to run my baits. tunining a lure can greatly increase you odds.a few old creek chub pikies, some woodies on the planer boards and were good to go. getting caught up into internet hype is a far cry from experience on the waters."
442486,lew,2010-03-11 13:01:00,12766," Good having you back on the board Dip, you always offer some good perspectives on things.  You'll remember back in the day when I used nothing but Stringese wire for musky and swore by it. Their excellent leaders, but like any wire they'll kink once a fish thrashes around and being very fussy about things like that, I'll discard a leader as soon as it kinks. Trouble is though, at about $5 apiece it got pretty expensive, specially if it was a good day with 3 or 4 fish and I had to toss every leader away.  JR got me onto fluoro a few years ago,  and I never looked back. I use 130  for all applications now & love it.  GOOD wire, fluoro, or even mono are excellent, and as you suggest, different strokes.......just as long as folks don't cheap out.  As for the new trend in the extra long musky rods, I haven't made that leap yet and don't really think I will, not in the immediate future anyways, at least not for my jerkbait rods. After close to 40 years of musky fishing it's kinda hard to break old habits  I like to work jerkbaits with the rod tip coming right to the water without touching it, and the rod pointing nearly straight down,  and on the Crestliner I found a 6' 6"" St. Croix was the perfect length, at least for my height of 5' 9"". When I bought the new Skeeter last year, which sits higher outta the water, I moved up to a 7' Compre. The 7'er definetely imparts far better action to the baits, specially twitch baits, but that brings my tip right to the water which is exactly where I want it. Any longer and I'd either be changing my rod action.......which I don't want to do, or have the tip hitting the water.  For casting, all my other rods are 7' 6"" which again is a personal choice and something that works well for me.  Besides that, the rod locker under the front deck of the Skeeter holds the 7' 6""ers perfectly and if I went up to longer rods I'd also have to buy a bigger boat again, and I'm not sure how I'd splain that to the Mrs"

442610,bridge,2010-03-11 19:25:00,54,"You didn't want to pay 20 bucks for baits that where recommended to you but you bought 16 (if my count was right) baits that I think most musky guys would shy away from.  For what you must have paid for those you could have gotten some good bucktials, suicks, believers.  If you only go out a few times a year you only need a couple to start.

442656,Devious,2010-03-11 21:07:00,49," So true.....I just got into muskie fishing last fall (got out 3 times) and aside from the proper release tools the weighted suicks would be next on my to buy list for any beginners. I got my first muskie (39"") on a 10"" weighted suick and had a 40+ follow me up on the same bait.....gave me a ton of confidence for the future when fishing suicks....I also want to say these guys here are bang on when suggesting 8ft+ rods....they really are a treat to fish with when going for muskies.....aside from that make sure you have a great net too......frabill quik cradle made it easy and painless when handing muskies....It can be expensive to get started up for muskie fishing but you will thank yourself (and those here) for being prepared with the proper gear once you have that big fish on and need to release it properly!!"
442665,Devious,2010-03-11 21:22:00,49, I don't quite understand what the need for the gaff is? You say muskie can be difficult to net but then you say you can gaff them precisely in the lip to avoid the gills? This is a bit contradicting no?

439952,Ron,2010-03-05 00:06:00,1683,"First of the season I have always been a big believer of down sizing your baits. The new Rapala Glide baits were very effective for me last year on opening weekend. A slow presentation does wonders on big fish. The smaller of the big tube jigs with little amount of weight, almost like being suspended over top of the fresh emergent weed. Sandy Bays will also be ""hot spots"" for my first choice of targeting Muskie in the beginning of the season.  Cheers, Ron..."
439959,Paully,2010-03-05 00:17:00,712,  Good advice Ron.. The earlier the season the smaller the bait.  Most of the time anyways..

440043,cram,2010-03-05 02:25:00,1733,"First, pretty sure the musky season won't have opened yet.  Must haves....  mepps musky marabou - good for early season, not too big and can be fished slow (for a bucktail) and proper release tools....especially bolt cutters.

440076,xeon,2010-03-05 04:04:00,350," Big pike hit the same things.   But as the list of things to bring, bunch of different sized mepps, sub surface baits like mantas or believers, top waters (props or jackpots), and a couple large cranks. Ask about bringing your own large gaff hook or net too, some places aren't always equipped."

440121,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-05 09:52:00,158,"Please do not take a gaf musky fishing.  A big sturdy net, mini bolt cutters, long needle nose pliers or hook doctor.  Early season usually means smaller baits and slower baits as some have already pointed out. Save the topwaters and larger trolling baits for later in the season  1. 6"" slamo skinner 2. XR-12 or 14 Xrap 3. 6"" soft bodied swim baits or tubes 4. Smaller Bucktails like mepps musky killer or maribou, showgirls, smallest cowgirls, little darlin' from dadson blade baits 5. Spinnerbaits, even bass sized ones get a lot of attention early in the season."
440124,xeon,2010-03-05 10:58:00,350," Don't listen to him! How do you seriously expect to get a muskie into a BECKMAN NET (make sure to ask the lodge if they have GOOD nets, you'd be surprised) if you cant manipulate its body in there yourself? Most of the fish swim away anyways, its just a little poke. But NEVER gaff around the gills, that's just plain unsporting.  I bought my gaff through Cabelas, just look in the saltwater section. I opted for the 4'' hook, with a 4' handle, but if I had to do it again, I would go for the one with the 5' handle to get even the most cautious figure 8'ers who know to stay back a bit (haha got those gals once or twice before). I usually get my figure 8'ers on the larger believers in Jailbird colour, although if the water is still going to be cold, go for the smaller size and possibly a more neutral colour. Also, you cant go wrong with Mepps 5's in natural for those cold front days, and even a Mepps 3 if you're feeling enough confidence to throw such a small lure. And yes, combined I've probably caught and seen well over 45-60 36-48'' muskies caught on #3's alone in a season.  Also another thing you can try doing is calling your lodge and asking them for detailed lure names, sizes, and colours. Or if they cant give you good info, try a couple of the lodges around there and telling them that you are considering them and have it about 95% talked over with the wife, and now you just need a lure shopping list for the meanwhile. That way they'll give out last years top producers unknowingly and honestly, and you might also be trying out new things on the water you're going to, its a win-win."

440405,lew,2010-03-06 00:41:00,12766,"Strawberry weighted Sledge and a Double ""D"" repainted with a spray bomb in Bumblebee are 2 of my go-to baits that always produce.    Boo-tails always work well too. The one on the left is what they look like new and on the right how they look after many many fish have chomped on them.    Believers & Jakes for trolling and a big old #950 Grim Reaper in orange and black for cranking down thru the weeds."

440448,Radnine,2010-03-06 01:25:00,1538,  I think the gaf is to swing at anyone that shows up from Muskies Canada The two times that I have had a muskie on have both been when they grabbed 1/2 to 3/4 lb. smallies that I was trying to land. That should tell you something. Good luck!
440586,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-06 09:49:00,158,"There are some nice nets out there.  Frabil makes some nice ones.  Musky might look big, mean and tough, but they are wimps, you have to take care of em' if you want them to survive.  Come guys even unhook all of their smaller fish that aren't hooked weel right in the water, not net, just unhook and she swims away. I haven't caught enough to get to that oint yet, but I feel i will.  Tkae rafs advice, he has given me plenty of pointers, serious musky hunter.  Yes Muskies love eating smallies and walleye's right off your line, pike too, greddy buggers.LOL  Lew I like those D's, nice paint jobs!"
441813,LipDip,2010-03-09 16:12:00,39,"Here are some random ideas to think about:  -Adjust your expectations according to the water you're fishing in.  -For every ten prople who give you pro advice on muskie fishing, maybe two of them will have a solid basis in fact, based on personal experience and long hours, invested intensly. There are more musky internet experts than there are muskie on earth. So far on this thread there have only been three (3) respondants who I've ever seen hold a fish over 40 inches. Been lucky enough to fish with two of 'em. Muskie experts are a dime a dozen. The guys who fish a lot, do well and specialize in muskie are a lot fewer and farther between. People who tell you that 'heavy tackle is overkill' etc etc etc are guys who have not done much muskie fishing, and consider the source when you read their advice column. It's just that simple. Talk is very cheap. And in the age of the Internet, it's free.....$0.  -Learn one or two lakes in intimate detail. Famliarity breeds success.  -Learn three or four styles of lures in intimalte detail. Familiarity breeds success.  -Fish for muskie a lot. Get into the boat with people who fish for muskie a lot. Never pass up a chance to fish with someone who fishes muskie a lot. Lots of them won't be found posting the same 32"" fish on 17 different English-speaking fishing boards Monday mornings all summer. Lots of the top guys are never online. If you talk to enough people near where you fish, I can almost promise you the top guys don't have an account, or post very infrequently. You'll learn more in four hours in the boat with a good fisherman than you will in a decade of media. Idon't think there's any arguing this one.  -If you have the option for a heavier outfit, buy this one instead of the lighter one.  -The trend in muskie rods right now is long. We use 8-9 footers exclusively. As a result, there are great deals on shorter rods (7 to 8') that guys are dumping following the trends. The long rod trend is a good one, though. Check used boards for great deals on good gear.  -The trend in reels is big and fast. Same as rods, great deals on reels that people are dumping following the trends. Great gear that has fallen out of vogue is all over the swap boards these days. I'm sure the economy and how it affects people's hobbies plays into this heavily, too.  -Handle fish fast, work as a team, cut hooks, one good pic and get them back.  -All-rubber and hard+rubber hybrid lures are good. Jerkbaits, skirts, soft tails on hard lures. They all work pretty well.  -Learn to make a few basic styles of lures. Spinners are easiest. It's fun as hell and you will catch fish on them.  -Learn to paint a few basic patterns, too. And learn to modifty, repair and salvage good lures. Either back on land or in the boat.  -Use the gear that you like and have had success with. Make sure it's strong and well-maintained. As long as you're using gear in the 'muskie weight class' and it works for you, ignore all the Bull about 'fluro vs. wire' or 'Shimano vs. Garcia; or 'Ranger vs. Lund.' It's all secondary noise.  -TAKE SOMEBODY OUT IN THE BOAT WITH YOU TO CATCH THEIR FIRST MUSKIE, OR SEE THEIR FIRST MUSKIE FOLLOW/BLOW-UP/CATCH."
441826,Harrison,2010-03-09 17:11:00,2202," Amen!  Largest Muskie I ever saw tried to eat my minn kota trolling motor, hit it so hard it rocked the boat, then she stayed, staring at it.  I hit the power, she crushed it again.  So I'll go with that for my #1  If LipDip is the ole ""icing 'appen when da puck"" dude, then him, Raf, Ron and Lewskie would probably agree it is more knowing the why, when, where they are, then the lure to catch'em."
