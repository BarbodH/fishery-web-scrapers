My wife and I have been fishing out of Wolseley Bay  (Wolseley Lodge) for about 5 years now.   Missed last year, but we're booked for this coming September.   Check out my previous posts/reports ... we'll go from there."

There is good fishing for pike and muskie very close, a ton of different kinds of structure and this area is very easy to navigate.  Harold does a good job of pointing out all the spots producing fish too.  Most productive colours I have used up there are Perch and Walleye colours.  But bright greens seem to work quite well from what I have seen in the pics on his wall."

I know its a changing thing and hard to predict just wondering if anybody has been up there in late june, whom may remember what the water temp was. Thanks again"
