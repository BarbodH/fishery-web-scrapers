445505,blaque,2010-03-19 18:13:00,2419,"OK, so when can one get down to the lower niagara for a nice dip of smelt?"
445517,Paully,2010-03-19 19:02:00,712,Thats not your everyday tributary.. as for your question
445521,blaque,2010-03-19 19:11:00,2419,i just said that lol
445604,philly86,2010-03-19 22:01:00,10,theres no smelt in the niagara
446257,blaque,2010-03-22 12:15:00,2419, Thanks bud........ill probably change all my plans to give it a shot then
446260,Billy Bob,2010-03-22 12:18:00,5865,April is usually the month for the spring smelt run.....The Niagara Rivers Association usually has a smelt fry as a fund raiser on the Lewiston Landing.
446335,blaque,2010-03-22 15:11:00,2419,"Yeah, i hear of it every year, but have never been.  They probably wont have it this year however based on what Philly has uncovered?"
446336,Billy Bob,2010-03-22 15:12:00,5865, I have heard there are no fish at all in the Niagara River....
446417,blaque,2010-03-22 17:24:00,2419," Yeah, i knew that......(someone should tell all those goofy charter captians that are still out there tryin)......i thought the smelt might still be hanging on though. Hopefully the upper hasnt been affected."
447548,Billy Bob,2010-03-24 13:14:00,5865," I read this in the Buffalo News today so I thought I would pass on this info.  ""Anglers have found rainbow smelt in the craws of trout caught during the past two to three weeks, but night-shift smelt dippers have yet to fill a net. Regulars read the water at 35-36 degrees right now. Generally, smelt move closer to shore when the gauges rise to 38-39 degrees"".  http://www.buffalonews.com/2010/03/23/997166/fishing-line-by-will-elliott.html"
447573,blaque,2010-03-24 14:03:00,2419," Thanks Billy B, i never thought to check out Wills info"
447635,Billy Bob,2010-03-24 16:06:00,5865," Do you know Will. We have been friends for about 40 years and fish together as much as possible...don't see him as often since he moved about 35 miles east of Lancaster to Pavilion, NY."
447673,blaque,2010-03-24 17:17:00,2419," The irony here, is yes i actually used to know ""Mr. elliot"". I know him as ""Mr."" because he was my High School english teacher at Depew High LOL!!"
447677,Billy Bob,2010-03-24 17:43:00,5865,"Yep, that's EXACTLY where we met.....been friends ever since...since then we have hunted and fish together for about 40 years now..."
