447398,irishfield,2010-03-24 02:17:00,26272,"Never seen anyone in a hurry to send the Government what they don't deserve...   .. but at some point in time.. the PST folks in Oshawa will send you a letter asking to prove where you paid taxes on it, or remit same. This may or may not happen.. it's a crap shoot (I get about 6 out of 10 on airplanes).. and with them all busy playing with their new found (6 months full severence) money.. without even changing desks, or missing a days work, to go from a provincial worker to a federal worker on June 1st...there's even a bigger chance you won't see a letter."
447444,Guest nuker,2010-03-24 03:29:00,0,"i bought a boat in august last year and i only paid tax on the trailer when i went to get the plates.  they didn't even ask me how much my boat was, just the trailer.  I didn't offer them the info either.  and the feds surely didn't ask.  so i don't know what the deal is either.  good thing cuz that tax i thought i had to pay on the spot got me a nice trolling motor and batteries!"
447476,Scott S,2010-03-24 06:09:00,203,That's exactly what I did. Just payed the tax on the boat trailer. I just finished sending a cheque to the ministry of finance for tax on my boat and motor. Scooter
447656,sfgibson1,2010-03-24 16:33:00,6,"  I thought I saw something last week when I was filling out my tax forms - something about ""Did you buy a boat in the last year and did not pay taxes"" - saw something to this effect on NetFile but didn't see anything in the forms??"
447662,Dara,2010-03-24 16:44:00,3052,"  Its a fishing boat. Send them 16 walleye fillets...but only 8 at a time, with skin attached. Wouldn't want them over the limit"
447664,Fisherman,2010-03-24 16:45:00,7201," Here's a start: For the application of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) to the supply of a new or used boat, please contact the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) by calling 1‑800‑959‑8287. Additionally, Provincial Sales Tax (PST) may need to be paid to the provincial/territorial government. You should contact your provincial/territorial Ministry of Finance to get more information on how to remit the PST.  For links to provincial/territorial departments of finance, business service centres, and other tax and financial services please visit the related provincial and territorial Canada Revenue Agency page     "
