446512,vance,2010-03-22 20:57:00,719,"Well thanks to John Bacon and Andy Rubaszek the coordinator, myself,Fishy Pete and non board member Gary got to spend 5 1/2 hours clipping fins on chinook fingerlings so they can be transplanted in Lake Ont.in 2 weeks.By listening to the conversations of the people working they were members of various fishing clubs in Ontario and high school students from the Stouffville area.Even with time out for burghers on the barbie Andy estimated that our group had done THIRTY THOUSAND fingerlings which is apparently a very good number.My shoulders ache, my back is stiff, my knees are throbbing but we had a lot of fun and are going to go back and do it next year.Believe it or not New York State has a machine that will do this in a blink of an eye but how much fun would that be?   Vance"
446696,iceguy,2010-03-23 01:06:00,341,Good to meet ya today Vance and your other buddys too. It feels good to give back to the fishery and free lunch to boot.

446820,fish_fishburn,2010-03-23 03:11:00,1311,"good work boys, hope you had your OFC hats on."
446825,John Bacon,2010-03-23 03:16:00,3277,Glad to hear that you all had a productive day.  Unfortunately I had to work late and couldn't be there.  I understand that the evening clipping for tomorrow night is cancelled.  If anyone does want to help out please be sure to contact Andy Rubaszek to let him know.  That way he can let you know if they will be there.  I wouldn't want anyone's first experience with the hatchery to be arriving just in time to see everybody else leaving.  The hatchery number is: 905-640-6204
446832,iceguy,2010-03-23 03:31:00,341,"They had there hats on that's how I knew there members here. It was amazing how fast we went through them today,I guess thats why they maybe cancelled tomorrow night."
446976,Great Lake Steel,2010-03-23 16:23:00,41,"Can someone post up here if they're done. I was planning on leaving work early on Friday to help out, but when I talked with them at the show they said to phone to make sure.  I don't want to be phoning every day, but if they finish early I can plan on working the afternoon.  Thanks!"
447026,vance,2010-03-23 17:53:00,719,I would phone today because Andy thought with all the people that were turning out they would be done on Wednesday.  vance
447264,John Bacon,2010-03-23 23:20:00,3277,Last I hear they were planning on clipping tomorrow night.  I am not sure about Thursday or Friday.  Here is a link to the hatchery site.  You may need to sign up to view it. http://ringwoodfcs.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=panda  They should update the site if the schedule changes.  I will try to post updates here myself.  Thanks for all the help.  We were worried that we may not have been able to clip enough fish for all the pens.  With this kind of turnout we may be able to add some more pens for next year.
447909,John Bacon,2010-03-25 03:19:00,3277,The clipping has continued to progress very well.  It looks like tomrrow will be the final day for clipping.  It will start at 9:00am and will probably wrap up in the afternoon.  It does not appear that an evening shift will be required.  Thanks for all the help.  The large number of volunteers made this years clipping go very smoothly despite having to clip more fish than ever before.
447955,Great Lake Steel,2010-03-25 11:23:00,41,"John,  Thanks to you guys for raising the fingerlings.  I live within 100m of one of the creeks where you're setting up pen's. It's nice to know that there are things underway to ensure my kids have the same if not better fishing that I enjoy today."
