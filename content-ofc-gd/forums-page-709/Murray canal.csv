Seen bass, the usual small stuff, sheepshead, pike & occasional walleye, and gobies of course.  Never any crappie though.  It was a nice place to shore fish, better before or after the highway swing bridges were in operation for the day.  Threw everything in the tackle box in there just to try it out.  Slip floats with worms & small minnows worked well (as always), or a walking sinker/floating jig head tipped with all kinds of plastics etc.  Michael"
