I've always fished up north, and never down here.  I'm a musky/SMB/pike/walleye fisherman, so all of this would be new to me.   Have heard about carp in bronte creek, and salmon off the piers.  Is there anything catchable via kayak?  Educate me.  What options are there?  (and, thanks in advance for your help/ideas)."
447927,uglyfish,2010-03-25 04:51:00,981,"lots of options within an hour of oakville. binbrook conservation area, mountsburg, kelso lake, valens conservation area, christie consertation area, hamilton harbour, lake ontario, grand river in caledonia, cayuga and dunnville.  harbour and grand river are great for a kayak, as are the conservation areas. and between all those areas, u'll have covered just about all the freshwater fish species to be caught in southern ontario and keep ya busy all 4 seasons!"
