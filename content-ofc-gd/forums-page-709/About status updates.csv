448376,cheaptackle,2010-03-26 11:44:00,849,"So this ""status"" only appears on the main page and can be toggled? Can't see what the big deal might be.  Kinda neat that there's that spot for daily messages I think. Not intrusive, is about members only (or is intended to be).  I thought I hadn't turned it ""on"" because I only saw it on the main page. Works for me, but maybe it should be scrollable to see all messages (if it is I haven't found out how yet).  Michael"
