I love experimenting with new baits, colors etc. Hit this slab of steel on a purple Riverworm in clear water earlier this week. Also did well on this color last spring. Should be a good weekend. Keep warm!!! "
275791,Bly,2008-12-05 15:38:00,1556,"Nice!   Curious, were you using that worm with a jig?   I usually see people ""wacky"" rigging them."
275799,silverstreak,2008-12-05 15:57:00,146,Hi Bly. Good observation!!! The key is to get your bait in the strike zone. At least that is my opinion. Take care.
275802,silverstreak,2008-12-05 16:04:00,146,Here is another from last spring. 
275804,Leecher,2008-12-05 16:07:00,7832,"Great report and pics silverstreak  Good looking steel, congrats Thanks for sharing Leechman"
275814,BillM,2008-12-05 16:23:00,17367,Nice pics!!!   Lets keep all the ice fishing threads at bay!
275820,okumasheffield,2008-12-05 16:48:00,318,Nice!  Just when I thought no one goes steeelheading anymore since it has been pretty quiet for a while  What was the size of the jig you used?  I found even 1/32 is too heavy for me
275843,pikeie,2008-12-05 17:51:00,380,purple is one of my fav steelie colours when im flyfishn!

275953,Mark Kulik,2008-12-05 23:16:00,348,"No surprise to me, purple is an amazing fish catcher, my favourite bow fly is the pple egg-sucking leech, bass-trout-walleye purple and pink always produces! "
276123,BillM,2008-12-06 03:29:00,17367,"Mark, that is some niiiiiiice water in that shot!!!"
276138,Mark Kulik,2008-12-06 04:14:00,348,"It is Bill , I don't steelhead nearly as much as I used to, but I got out this past spring with my old freind Craig Ritchie, also filmed a steelhead show, I really miss it-hope to do some more this spring!"
447669,Kinger,2010-03-24 17:09:00,351,"Gonna grab some more different purple marabou feathers today.  Nice fish, beauty colors."
447682,sconceptor,2010-03-24 18:31:00,146,"Purple is a fanastic colour to use!!!!!!!  I prefer it over pinkies.  After steel is done, I like it on my walleye trips.  It's a colour walleye see better than most, especially in the dark or stained water.  Lure's with just a touch of purple do well a lot of time.  Read a few pros agree, purple is one of their fav colours.  Rapala has a few colours with a touch of purple, Reef Runner, a walleye target bait company, also has a lot of purple(Eriedescent a fav).  One of my only good days off a pier for salmon, I switched from the classic blue and silver cleo, to a glow green cleo, and finally to a purple black knock off cleo.  The purple and black got nailed twice, with not success on the others.  Purple should be a colour in your box, right there with perch pattern, chartreuse, white, fire tiger, shad, black, and copper."
