447797,Jackie,2010-03-25 00:06:00,124,"Hey guys,  I want to buy a fish finder for the trolling motor. I have these two in mind right now : Eagle Cuda 300 or EagleÂ® FishEasy 245 DS Just wondering if they are good enough to do the basic stuff accurately...like finding structures, and depth etc....!?!?!? Or do I REALLY have to spend $300 or more to get a really good one to mount on the trolling motor???? Suggestions PLEASE!!!!   Thank you!  Jackie"
