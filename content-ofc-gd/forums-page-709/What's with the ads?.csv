I guess I don't visit as long as other members.  Only time an ad bothered me was on the ""Classified"" section. When a member changed his handle to the same one the ads have. That was kind of childish I think, especially when people were kind of up in arms about the ads to begin with.  Other than not knowing what the ad is about, I can't understand why the advertisers would put up an ad that gives no hint of what they are selling.  I never click on ads like that.

IE7 might work fine if your Java is completely up to date...most people are running rather old Java on their comps though...which is a big risk cause lots of the new exploits out there now target computers with out of date Java.

I guess that is what Rick ment WHEN HE SAID IT DONT WORK IN ie7, go figure. Sorry all at least  in ie7 lo fi it works ok ,I will learn to live with it Im sure . because as G said a rose in any color smells the same.At home things work well, probably better for my employer , Again I beg forgiveness ,(I need a good recipe for CROW the one Im chewing on now dont taste so good) Bruce"

447093,bigfish1965,2010-03-23 19:23:00,3382," Sorry you feel this way Bruce. But would you rather we had the site hacked and lost completely? Each time we upgrade people dont like it, but each time people get used to it. Eventually everyone wonders how they lived without the new version. We could get rid of the ads completely by charging a membership fee if that is more palatable. As has been explained MANY time, the avatar block can be changed by altering the page size (CTRL and mouse wheel scroll). As far as the blogs go, it was a two part problem. One...it was not being used enough to warrant the licensing fee. Two, it had been attacked dozens of times, once resulting in us getting kicked off a server. I have an option for those who do want to blog that will be coming soon. The initial page does not look much different than the old one...but it does looks much cleaner to me. And I guess anyone who disagrees with you is an ass kisser? Here's a hint..if no one else has the same problem as you.. IT IS NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SITE. I can log in and run the whole site without issue using IE8, Firefox, Opera and Chrome."
447099,vance,2010-03-23 19:36:00,719,So its been a whole THREE days of the new and improved site and things have changed a little every day.Some things work out and some don't and there is nothing wrong with expressing your opinion on things in general BUT it has taken the OFC 10 years to get this far why not wait a week or two for the dust to settle and then see if you are OUT OF HERE...   vance
447102,TJQ,2010-03-23 19:42:00,7806,"Bruce, that's a shame really.. you will be missed, and theres no reason to leave.  Theres a couple of reasons we went to the upgrade, mainly spambot/hackers/speed issues.  The main look of the board has always been the club skin so we bought the updated version of it.  Did you try the default skin???  One of the main issues is that its difficult to see what its all gonna look like till its installed... we tried some ads in the threads..  some people didn't like it, so we are going back to the old style.  Its not that we aren't listening, we are definitely doing what we can.  BUT the bottom line is (and we held off doing this for a long time) is that we had to upgrade to the next version.  There really wasn't much of a choice.  I had a photogallery a few years ago. It ran three years and had thousands of pictures on it. It got hacked and we lost everything, all because everything was ""working fine""  so I didn't bother to upgrade the software...  till it got destroyed,  then it was way, way too late.  I won't learn that lesson again, especially here.  ""OFC MICKEY MOUSE""  ... after 10 years of trial and tribulations here, hours and hours of good work and deeds for other people... well, that just hurts my feelings."

Understand IPBoard (The software we are using) is not written just for us.. there are millions of forums just like our out there.

446931,MJL,2010-03-23 14:17:00,2427, Or when Danbo went through that David Hasselhoff phase for a couple months  The ads do get pretty annoying though...Some of them I can't even tell what they're for.LOL  Adblock filters out the rest and leaves a blank post.
446935,Cast-Away,2010-03-23 14:37:00,790,"I use Google Chrome and all of the ads are automatically blocked. Give it a try, it is a great browser with the favourite website window pain as the home page. OFC is one of the eight that I have pinned!"
446939,Kinger,2010-03-23 14:42:00,351,My adblocker blocks them anyways so i don't see them.  They are just empty boxes.
446945,Gerritt,2010-03-23 15:00:00,6129,"I have set Firefox to block all ads/images coming from googleads.g.doubleclick.net  All I see now is a blank post..  and you are right Wayne... some of the content was questionable.  All of the ads were not even remotely related to the outdoors.. mostly marketing and webhosting stuff...with the odd scantly clad women wanting me to visit a fitness dating site, as she shows off her cleavage.  Does this site receive revenue every view? or every click? as I cannot see it generating very much income on a per click basis, given the content of the ads. if the ads were related to outdoor related products and services (ie lodges, suppliers, outfitters etc) I would be more inclined to click on something that catches my interest...  Dating, marketing and web hosting are not something I am interested in.  my 0.02 cents on it..  G."
446958,fish-miester,2010-03-23 15:34:00,864,   Same
446969,TJQ,2010-03-23 15:57:00,7806,Sponsor ads are gone... were working on alternatives...
446974,Gerritt,2010-03-23 16:09:00,6129,you guys are on the ball and dont mess around!
446979,Spiel,2010-03-23 16:35:00,9065, Spiel Filter? There's no Spiel filter just some occasional post reply editing for those that seem to have difficulty understanding the rules which seem to be pretty straight forward.
446981,bigfish1965,2010-03-23 16:37:00,3382,"The crawlers take awhile to index the content on the site. We then get assessed by keywords. Sponsors then bid on those keywords. Until the new crawl is done, you get ads from sponsors who will take anything. The fact that many people appear to be blocking ads here is exactly why it had to be done. Some ads are per click, some by impression. By blocking we lose impression counts. It is not a huge inconvenience to disable Ad Block for OFC in order to keep this thing afloat. The ad bot will continue in other forum areas for now."
446985,Terry,2010-03-23 16:48:00,14456,ok  I have turned off my Ad blocker
446986,irishfield,2010-03-23 16:50:00,26272," Exactly Chris and why I questioned why adverts are okay stating ""how's your Love Thermometer??"" .. and we couldn't post anything of such..... what's the word for it! lol"
446991,Terry,2010-03-23 16:56:00,14456, LOL  I have heard words on tv when my kids were watching an after school special that can't be used here.....but rules are rules
446992,Gerritt,2010-03-23 16:59:00,6129,  hahahaha! School of Rock!
446994,irishfield,2010-03-23 17:00:00,26272,"Or Dano's ""dancing darling"" had to go.. yet ads have been popping up showing more in them than his avatar ever did..."
446996,TJQ,2010-03-23 17:03:00,7806,   Ya know guys... were just doing the best we can.....  
447002,irishfield,2010-03-23 17:07:00,26272,Not questioning that TJ... rules have been set that we have to keep it PG and we.. and sometimes even you ...do our best lol .. ..  you can't have adverts popping up that aren't.
447003,TJQ,2010-03-23 17:08:00,7806," I realize that, but until google reindex the pages were gonna get some wierd stuff.   "
447005,Gerritt,2010-03-23 17:14:00,6129,I kind of like the weird stuff... call me sick and twisted...  freaky deaky!  G
447047,Gerritt,2010-03-23 18:29:00,6129,"hey! there was a fishing related ad! Ohhh JOY! so I clicked it..  Something about the ""Secret Weapon"" but they wont show you what it is LOL!  it was an interesting video though...  just seemed a little to far fetched for me, as they wont show you or tell you what it really is!  Anyways just thought I would post this, as it seems that there are ads being placed that are related to us.   G"

446621,cheaptackle,2010-03-22 23:58:00,849,"Have we been hacked?  How come there's ""sponsor"" ads showing up in the threads?  Michael"
446624,misfish,2010-03-23 00:00:00,29133, Check out Ricks post.
446626,TJQ,2010-03-23 00:01:00,7806,I think were gonna try showing one google ad per post. We have to raise our revenue up a bit to cover our costs...
446629,cheaptackle,2010-03-23 00:03:00,849,"TJ, I can well appreciate the need, I really can. But it is annoying! Won't say another word about it.  Michael"
446630,TJQ,2010-03-23 00:06:00,7806,Ive been on a ton of boards that do it that way... unless everyone wants to PAY to be on here.. lol...
446631,cheaptackle,2010-03-23 00:10:00,849,"Like I said - I appreciate the need!  I'm on 5 other boards and none of them have the ads BUT they also have a lot less features than what you offer.  Trade offs are always a necessity, obviously you can't cover the costs out of pocket. Once it's gotten used to I'm sure it will be a non-issue.  Michael"
446655,Terry,2010-03-23 00:27:00,14456,yeah I visit lots of boards that have them and the ones that key one certain words then that word becomes a link to an ad... it's the way of the future of the internet..someone has to pay for everything...so I will not complain  well maybe a little
446658,danbouck,2010-03-23 00:30:00,4380,I like em.
446659,misfish,2010-03-23 00:30:00,29133, What ever pays the bills. I just cant believe you go to other boards. Oh the shame
446662,TJQ,2010-03-23 00:32:00,7806,  Its true... but not fishing ones... hot water heater repair.. and tutu repair sites..  tahts it I swear... and were gonna keep it down to one ad per thread....   
446666,brifishrgy,2010-03-23 00:35:00,559,they dont seem to be working for me .. the space for the ad bot is there but no ad
446667,TJQ,2010-03-23 00:35:00,7806,"  LOL.. I remember when Yahoo said they would never be a ""for profit"" site....  "
446716,vance,2010-03-23 01:20:00,719,Okay I am old enough to know better BUT what are my chances with those young sexy girls from Toronto that the ad says they will date me  :D  :P  vance
446719,irishfield,2010-03-23 01:23:00,26272,Chances of them going out with you Vance.. or you catching something if they do??
446729,vance,2010-03-23 01:33:00,719,slim to nill and highly likely  vance
446733,cheaptackle,2010-03-23 01:36:00,849,"Ad must keep changing - says something about IQ & E-marketing now, maybe that's your answer to your chances - advertise!  Michael"
446736,Terry,2010-03-23 01:37:00,14456,the ads look all through your computer to see what type of websites you like before it puts up an ad everyone gets his own ad basic on your life style so if your are getting porn ads..guess what                 ok just kidding I made the whole thing up..LOL
446737,vance,2010-03-23 01:39:00,719,So do you think do you think-FAT OLD SINGLE GUY NEEDS WOMAN-would work  vance
446739,cheaptackle,2010-03-23 01:40:00,849,"OKAY!  Every time I see an ad now I am gonna be thinking of how it might apply to poor Vance! I will be officially completely deranged momentarily. The ad just now said ""Want more Hits?"" (to your website) Ouch!  Michael"
446746,vance,2010-03-23 01:51:00,719,
446786,fish_fishburn,2010-03-23 02:36:00,1311,Vance throw in there that she must be able to clean fish and you should be okay.
446811,kickingfrog,2010-03-23 03:01:00,8333, If you got the money honey....
446814,adempsey,2010-03-23 03:07:00,1498,Looks like 1 ad per page?  Doesn't bother me.  I find them very odd though.  Just some wacky photo of something.
446838,bigfish1965,2010-03-23 03:39:00,3382, Its just like having Clampett back on the site...insert random image here....
