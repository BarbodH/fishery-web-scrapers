447759,johnnyb,2010-03-24 22:08:00,3413,"Nice motor, Archie!  And I'm pretty sure I can see the fine print on the motor that tells you the proper side is facing up   Lookin' forward to your first report outta the walleye dinghy....just be careful turning around at the boat launches...I heard a story about a coupla guys up your way who ended up in the ditch one dark night"
447768,TJQ,2010-03-24 22:28:00,7806,That is a thing of beauty.
447778,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 23:11:00,618, It's going on a 2005 Princecraft Holiday 16 foot I bought from Ottawa .   As am I....and as for the ditch...IT WAS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING! What a start to a good day   Thank you sir.
447880,Dara,2010-03-25 02:19:00,3052,  yep...way too much time. I brought in a 14lb King on the 2000 with no problem  I see the research though...better price than I paid too...I know what I'm doing from now on
447886,pike slayer,2010-03-25 02:31:00,1177,"and whos gonna pull the boat to the river for you archie??? i'll drive you and load and unload it if you gas up the outboard and make sammys, i'll go anytime! and ya i was layed off for and on EI for 2weeks and went back to work and started a new job 3weeks ago still working construction and currently doing fine!"
447895,Eazy,2010-03-25 02:42:00,260,"I've got a diesel, you've got a boat!"
447897,Eazy,2010-03-25 02:46:00,260, I wonder if this involved a couple of Lucky Lagers?.............LOL!
447935,archie_james_c,2010-03-25 06:28:00,618,I make a hell of a sandwhich do I not?
447959,DanD,2010-03-25 11:35:00,2223,"As for all this laying the motor on its side thing; once you have it off the pallet, you’ll notice that there’s a couple of feet/tabs on the one side of the motor’s case. Which makes it pretty much a no brainer; as which side, to lay the motor on, (if you ever had to) or at least mine did; it’s a 04 Honda 40 tiller.  Dan."
447979,limeyangler,2010-03-25 12:39:00,5204,"Great looking motor Archie, my buddy has an older model of the exact same one....it purrs.........you'll love it...  As for the rods and reels....................I HATE YOU........................lol..............just kidding"
448140,archie_james_c,2010-03-25 22:04:00,618," Yah the steel pallet it is bolted to has feet on only one side...which is a no brainer as to how you'd lay it.  thanks for the kind words Limey, even with all these fancy rods I still wont be able to winch in eye's like you!!  As for my jigging rod for this season I'm debating the following...  6'3"" Medium X-Fast Croix Legend Elite ""                 "" Croix Legend Tournament Walleye IMX or GL3 Loomis 6' Medium, fast  ........"
447160,archie_james_c,2010-03-23 21:27:00,618,Well 1 of the 3 parts needed to make my Walleye Dingy has arrived today and is home safe and sound! A 2010 Honda 50 hp Tiller! Still waiting on the Marina in Ottawa to ship me my boat   . Then all I'll need is a trailer to put it all on   .  
447166,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-23 21:34:00,0,hopefully it's laying on the proper side! j/j should be a good pick up!  congrats!
447171,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-23 21:38:00,4399,were you not the guy that was unemployed? EI benefits must be lucrative these days! Just kidding young fella good luck with the Honda.
447176,archie_james_c,2010-03-23 21:44:00,618,Won't make a difference. I just pushed it off the back of the truck and whereever it fell it fell  .   Me? I'm not unemployed   . Are you mistaking me for Worm Dangler? I was laid off this past summer. Got called back to work in October...
447186,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-23 21:52:00,4399,  I think so! Sorry
447241,archie_james_c,2010-03-23 22:52:00,618,
447323,Ron,2010-03-24 00:32:00,1683,Looking forward to see the whole shootin match together.
447402,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 02:19:00,618, As am I   . Me and my 2 friends have understood...we NEED to rent a truck and drive to Ottawa to get it...and...visit the local bar's   . Anyone in the area wanna meet up for a coffee or beer?
447415,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-24 02:35:00,0, Four stroke owners can correct me if i'm wrong but the ones i've used can only be laid down on one side.  That's the joke I was making.  If you lay your motor on the wrong side good luck getting it started...the crank oil will drain out.
447416,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-24 02:36:00,0,(it likely says so right on the motor)
447418,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 02:38:00,618,  It doesn't say anything on the motor...AND I layed it on the side it was laying on at the Honda Dealer and thats how it's srapped to the steel pallete   . So there! Go back to floating some steelies Dr. Sal....   Kidding
447430,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-24 03:02:00,0,"well look into in bro. every 4 stroke i've ever seen can only be laid on one side.  i'm sure there's people far more experienced that can clarify that...  regardless it's sweet and i look forward to an upgrade from the ""finnish flash"" some day."
447591,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 14:46:00,618," I shall look into it good sir! I'm just assuming it's on the proper side because it's bolted to the steel frame to be laid down only one way...like the feet of the pallet are only on one side, so thats the side you'd instinctively lay it on.  As for having a hard time starting it up...no I won't...cuz they told me to bring it to them to start it up and set it up"
447592,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 14:47:00,618,Phase 2/3 will commence this weekend!!! Me and 3 friends are gonna make a road trip to Ottawa to get the boat and bring it back. We will also be sampling the bars   .  Anyone in the area wanna meet up for coffee or beer?
447597,Abraxus,2010-03-24 14:59:00,104,"Dr. Salvelinus is correct.  On every 4 Stroke I have owned, the dealership has been quite specific with regards to how you lay the motor down.  I have owned two now and perhaps it may only be a Mercury thing, but I was told that the motor should only be laid down on one particular side so that the oil does not drain out into the rest of the motor.  If one can, the motor should always be stored in an upright position in order to avoid making the mistake of laying it on the wrong side.  I havent really had to worry about the my new motor since it is a 60hp and always remains sitting on my boat.  Having said this, you may want to look into this and ask your dealership the question.  Otherwise, the new motor looks great!  I am sure you will enjoy it immensely! Congrats!  Ab"
447605,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-24 15:06:00,10439,I doubt that he will have to worry about which side to lay it down as it wll be bolted to the transom of his boat and will likely never come off the boat.
447609,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 15:10:00,618, I beleive they're more worried about how it's being stored right now Drifter. And as I said guys....this is exactly how it was laying AT THE DEALER when I picked it up AND there are only feet on ONE side of the pallet for you to lay it on the ground.  I'm pretty sure this is how it's supposed to be laid   .  And yes...by Monday that big silver whoore is gonna be bolted onto my new boat   and making some atlantics awful nervous down in our local river.
447612,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 15:13:00,618,Look what you started Sal!!! If I see you in the tribs you're gettin' a kick in the crotch
447625,Dara,2010-03-24 15:44:00,3052,"  So did they give you the 10 at the 09 price?  And yeah..If the manufacturer strapped it to a pallett they likely laid it the right way down. If not, its the dealers problem geting it started."
447628,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 15:49:00,618," The 09 was $6349, they gave me this one at $6999. I was fine with that. And they got it in in a pretty timely fashion...once he located one that is. Overall the experience with Esquire Honda was so-so. I felt the communication by the salesman was kinda poor. I had to contact him to find out what the situation was and such, it should have been the other way around."
447629,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-24 15:49:00,0, hehehe!  i was just trying to be helpful!
447721,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 20:42:00,618," No worries   .  My new reel arrived today. A Team Daiwa Advantage-A 2500, paired it with 15lb PP. It and the line selection should work well on my St.Croix Legend Tournament Walleye 7' Medium, moderate action for trolling worm harnesses and casting/trolling shallow crankbaits.  Here's a pic side by side of my Mojo Bass 6'9"" Med=Lite, X-fast/Daiwa Tierra 2000 for those of us who like gear pics.   The Advantage is a mich darker grey than the pics show it...which I really like.    "
447728,Dara,2010-03-24 21:06:00,3052,Is it as smooth as the Tierra?   I have the Tierra 2000 and love it.
447736,archie_james_c,2010-03-24 21:20:00,618,"  I'd say it's noticeably more ""solid"" feeling than my Tierra 2000. As for ""smoothness"" when reeling it's pretty much the same. The biggest reason I wanted to go to the Advantage is because their drag system is twice as powerful as the equivalent sized Tierra. Where our Tierra 2000's have a max drag of 4.4 lbs the Advantage all the way up to the Fuego-A has a max drag of 8.5 lbs. For this 7' rod I wanted a 2500 size reel to take advantage of the 15.5 lb max drag of the Advantage-A or higher, as opposed to the 8 something pounds the Tierra 2500 would have offered.  I probably won't really need the extra power but...I have too much time to ponder these things in my head"
447755,trapshooter,2010-03-24 21:58:00,1234,Tiller.... nice.  So what boat are you putting this motor on?
