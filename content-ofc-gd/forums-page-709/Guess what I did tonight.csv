448246,bassman87,2010-03-26 00:39:00,586,nice mirror carp
448266,hammercarp,2010-03-26 01:22:00,964,A fully scaled mirror. WTG! Congradulations.
448269,Victor,2010-03-26 01:33:00,1609,Congrats on the fully scaled mirror! Is that your first ever?
448272,danbouck,2010-03-26 01:39:00,4380, Yes it is
448274,dave524,2010-03-26 01:41:00,4508, A fully scaled mirror?? I am clearly confused
448278,cwpowell,2010-03-26 02:02:00,265,"Congrats on that man. But what am I missing here, I've never fished for carp, they gross me out for one, they aren't a pretty fish, bass, pike, muskie, browns, rainbows, speckles, to me those are beautiful fish! Is it the fight they put up? What is it? They just don't appeal to me. Fill me in guys!"
448286,Leecher,2010-03-26 02:16:00,7832,Congrats on your first mirror Dan NICE Leechman
448287,splashhopper,2010-03-26 02:17:00,2931," They fight like crazy.... take some bread and some corn.. make a small doughball about the size of a quarter and bury a # 6 bait hook in it.... put a couple of large split shots about a foot above the doughball and hook.  Toss it in an area where you know carp reside... and keep your hand on your trout rod.... let the bait sit on the bottom.... when that line moves,,, get ready to set the hook,.,, and then HANG ON ,,,,, Carp are a BLAST .... even if I didn't know that Dan's carp had a mirro on it !  lol  wtg Dan,,,"
448295,uglyfish,2010-03-26 02:29:00,981,"god that thing is ugly lol but yea, they are fun to catch."
448301,hammercarp,2010-03-26 02:33:00,964,Cw How many fish over 30lbs have you caught?
448310,Kinger,2010-03-26 03:03:00,351,"Beauty and congrats, that must feel damn good!"
448314,Dutchy,2010-03-26 03:07:00,416," What I was going to say. I caught the one in my avatar last year while fishing for steelhead. Totally unexpected. I didn't see that fish until 10 minutes into the fight. Took me 100 yards upstream. To put the fish in perspective, I am 6 foot 3 and er 250lb."
448341,MJL,2010-03-26 04:07:00,2427,Great catch Dan!  A beauty of a specimen.  I can count on a single hand the number of fully scaled carp I've caught over 20+yrs of fishing for them.  Well done.   A fully scaled mirror carp has large irregular shaped scales - at least by normal common carp standards - covering its whole body.  Itâ€™s a rarity in terms of North American carp.  You have a standard common carp which has regular scale patterns over its body.   You have a mirror carp (which has irregular shaped scales. Leather carp have no scales whatsoever.  Linear mirror carp have a single row of scales along their lateral lines.  These are regular mirror carp       I normally get 1 mirror carp for every 200 common carp I get.  Some places have better concentrations than others.  Definitely can't go wrong with carp
448345,Jonny,2010-03-26 04:14:00,1380,"Dan, your fish looks about half-way between a ""standard"" carp and a mirror carp.  Nice catch! I've never caught one."
448351,Lunatic,2010-03-26 05:05:00,536,"LOL that 2nd last carp looks like barney gumble or something, it looks drunk....and ugly. ive caught about 4 carp maybe 5 in my life,none really gave me a ""good fight"" all were in the 10lb range. Although i still have many people tell me stories about hard fighting carp. they're just too ugly for me"
448358,Victor,2010-03-26 06:51:00,1609," If you don't fish for the table, and only does C&R, it doesn't really matter how they look like. You can hook into big fish and potentially get decent numbers as well within a 15 minutes drive from home. (seeing that you're from Hamilton, I'm actually very jealous of that)  They do fight harder when it's warmer, maybe all the ones you've hooked into so far were caught during the cooler months? If you have a couple of hours to kill, give it another go when it's warmer. Hamilton Harbour houses alot of big fish, there are some 30s in there and even 40s have been caught."
448359,Lunatic,2010-03-26 07:21:00,536,"to be honest a big reason why i do not target carp is because its more of a sit n wait type of fishing. i prefer jigs,spinners and top water action. only when truly bored do i bust out the bobber n worm set ups. even tho one carp i caught was hooked on a spoon."
448369,dave524,2010-03-26 11:08:00,4508," Thanks for the explanation, I actually do carp fish a bit, caught several various stages of mirrors, just assumed due to the fact that it was fully scaled it really couldn't be called a mirror."
448373,danbouck,2010-03-26 11:29:00,4380, There is not much waiting if you find a good spot. I had one on yesterday before I was able to set my rod down.
448388,TJQ,2010-03-26 12:58:00,7806,Who knew there was so much to learn about carp!!!
448394,skeeter,2010-03-26 13:13:00,1907,they might be ugly. but have you ever thought of what the fish think about when they see who caught them?  
448395,MJL,2010-03-26 13:20:00,2427, No worries TJ...The article should be on its way in the coming week  700 words was definitely not enough   ...I got a little bit excited when I wrote it
448410,danbouck,2010-03-26 14:46:00,4380," I've been waiting a while to read it, can't wait!"
