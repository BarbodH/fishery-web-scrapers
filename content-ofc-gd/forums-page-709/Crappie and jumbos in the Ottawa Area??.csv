Hoping to go out for a couple hours this weekend and was just wondering if they were biting. I know Dows lake is still covered with ice but Mooney's bay looks nice and clear. Not so sure what the Ottawa river conditions are like but i'm assuming the water levels are nice and high as in the Rideau.  Thanks in advance for any info.  Tight Lines! Fishingitus"
