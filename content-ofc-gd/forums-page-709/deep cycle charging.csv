Now when I'm charging them, I assume I don't have to disconnect them from each other and charge them separetly?  It should just act like one big battery no?  And also, should I unplug the trolling motor upfront in the bow or disconnect right from the battery when I'm charging?  Thx"
447353,danbouck,2010-03-24 01:10:00,4380,It should be fine as long as the batteries are the exact same and new. Disconnecting the trolling motor at the bow should be fine.  But I'm not an expert.
447357,Terry,2010-03-24 01:12:00,14456,yeah that will work fine for you
447361,irishfield,2010-03-24 01:16:00,26272,Yep.. identical batteries and same vintage.. you're fine!  And yes... you should always get in the habit of unplugging your trolling motor during charging. Especially if it's a wireless model..
447853,dada2727,2010-03-25 01:36:00,108,"Well the batteries aren't new, and probably don't hold the same charge.  So I'm guessing I should avoid banking them up?  What harm can it do to the battieries?"
447904,irishfield,2010-03-25 03:12:00,26272,Not an issue that they aren't new... they just need to be the same capacity and age... Ie: a matched set.
448028,wallyboss,2010-03-25 15:16:00,1095,I have a Jumper between the 2 batteries that I remove for charging. Ist because the batteries are not a matched set and secondly I only have a 1 bank charger installed in my boat. My second battery is charged with a separate charger. It's a hassle but it works for me.
448033,Grimace,2010-03-25 15:33:00,2020,"I have 2 in parallel, I leave them that way to charge.  Works fine.   One is interstate other is nautilous. Same age same capacity like the others said."
448059,Sinker,2010-03-25 17:15:00,8692,"When you've got two together like that, they will only hold as much power as the weakest battery.  Other than that, it will work fine.  s."
