At this current moment im using cheap 39 $ glasses and am wanting to purchase a pair of better quality. my price range is up to about 200.00 $. Im looking for suggestions from you guys who have used them before and can personally recommend. Name brands and models would be helpful and appreciated, or if you have any other tips in selecting the correct lens.thanks guys look forward to you answers. Matt"
448074,Lunker777,2010-03-25 18:31:00,866,"I picked up a pair of ""Solar Bat"" glasses last year and they are AWESOME !!!! Its crazy to see the difference between a cheap $40 pair from bass pro off the rack and a quality set of lenses !  I bought the ""cool eyes D"" in the mossback gradient lense. But I have a MONSTER head... so they kind of looked funny ! I traded them in on a pair of ""double XL"" and I absolutly LOVE them !!! If I could make one change, then I should have listened to Jos @ angling outfitters and gone with the yellow lense as opposed to the Mossback gradients.  So in the end... I would suggest looking at Solar Bat glasses becasue they are awesome quality... and the price is very reasonable.  Oh ya.... JP was the one who suggested these frames to me !! If you watch his show.... he wears the Cool eyes D frames. They look a little better on him then they did on me ! haha"
448076,bare foot wader,2010-03-25 18:44:00,1354,"most big brands out there have great models to choose from...and it's mostly personal preference what makes them great...lens colour and material are the 2 big factors in my opinion that you need to consider  glass lenses will give you the best optical advantage and scratch resistance, plastic is the lightest and polycarbonates are the toughest and most impact resistance  in low light conditions yellow and amber, etc will offer the most visibility...brown and amber will offer the most contrast and most common i'd say...and dark grey and photochromic are the best for bright conditions, ie big water where you're not sight fishing at all  kinda like irons really, need a full set to play a full round...i haven't tried interchangeable lenses yet but next pair probably will  my favourite pairs are amber lenses and kinda of a pinkish/amber-ish mix....i use these for river fishing where i'm sight fishing a lot..."
448090,codered,2010-03-25 19:37:00,123,  I agree
448093,codered,2010-03-25 19:46:00,123,I have been wearing ray bans  for  about  4  years   the polarized  ones i dont know   the  name  of the  style  butt   they  are  by  far  the  best  i  have  ever  owned  . if  you  want a good  pair  for  spot  fishing   and  seeing   were  others  can't  this  is  definitly  my  choice..I have  passed  them to  buddies   hundreds of  times  so  they  can  see   what  im  looking  at  be  it  fish  weed  lines  under water  structure ect.. bought them  at the  sunglass  hutt ..I have rann them  over  with  my  truck  stepped  on a pair  and  broke them  more than  once. they will  replace them  for  half the price if broken. And manufacturer  defects are a free  pair...well  worth  checking them  out ... p.s sorry  about the spelling  I    dont  have  spell check  yett  ...
448099,jediangler,2010-03-25 20:10:00,1923,I usually wear the cheapies but I do have a pair of Maui Jims that are really great.
448104,wkrp,2010-03-25 20:25:00,656,Maui Jims expensive but worth it
448107,Great Lake Steel,2010-03-25 20:41:00,41,"Does anyone make a pair of clear polarized lenses? The times I find I need them most is when there's a lot of glare off the surface from low sun angles (sunrise/sunset) if the glare was eliminated I could see fine, but my sunglasses cut the little bit of light in the water that need to see (gray)."
448111,cranks bait,2010-03-25 20:50:00,721,I have been wearing Tifosi glasses for the past five years.  They make a Fototec Polarized lens.  I absolutely love them.  They change the shade as the sun gets brighter but always seem clear when you look out of them without having to squint.  They run about $125.00.  There has been times where it is dark out and I am still wearing my glasses without realizing that I don't need them but the polarization is still handy to have.

448124,BillM,2010-03-25 21:11:00,17367,Just picked up a pair of Maui Jims with glass lenses...  Oh so nice..
448126,troutologist,2010-03-25 21:13:00,951,"costa del mar with the 580 glass.  I've tried smith, dragon, oakley and h20 optics and nothing even comes close.  I do still love the polarized rapalas for canoe tripping or other times I know they're gonna take a beating."
