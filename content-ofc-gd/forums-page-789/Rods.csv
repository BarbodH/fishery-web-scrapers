382194,Raf,2009-09-11 15:56:00,3495,"Okuma has their EVx series of muskie rods which in my opinion are a great entry level rod.  They come in all sorts of lengths up to 9'3"" (telescopic) with a price tag around $100 and a lifetime warranty.  You will not find a better bang for the buck.  I use their 8'6"" XH telescopic.  One thing I've noticed is that their ratings are a little generous.  ie.  a Heavy Okuma Rod = a medium heavy St. Croix.   A good all-round rod is in the 7'6"" range.  If Okuma is not to your liking St. Croix has their ""triumph"" line which are decent rods as well at a much smaller price point than their Premiere and Legend series.

382386,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-12 02:53:00,947,If your rod shopping don't forget to take your reel with you.  That's the best way to test out a rod if it's up to your specs. I also like to spend the extra money on a lifetime warranty rod.  Plus the quality excellent and light weight so you can throw them spinner's and spoons all day long
382624,Dabluz,2009-09-13 06:01:00,701,"Lifetime warranty....you pay for that and you don't need it.  I've been fishing for over a half century and I have broken 2 rods on fish during all of this time.  One rod was an ancient hollow fiberglass rod that I broke when I was about 17 years old and the other was last year at age 61 when I broke a 15 dollar IM7 graphite rod that I bought at Walmart on liquidation.  The rod was a ""Renegade"" and I had been using it heavily for about 7 years.  I also loaned it to a guy who had never fished before.  I have a feeling that he knocked it pretty hard on the side of my boat because it snapped real easy on a small pike.  As for the warranty issue, I have had 2 rods replaced by Berkley and these rods did not have an unlimited warranty.  The first rod was an old hollow fiberglass rod (Curt Gowdy Signature rod) and I broke it when trying to twist it.  Berkley sent me a new rod and after 3 years, I sent it back and told them that the rod was no good.  They then sent me their new model called ""Lightning Rod"".  Yes...it was 1984.  I still have that rod but I broke it when I rolled my snowmobile.  It is now a short ice fishing rod.  The other rod they replaced was a Series One steelhead rod that I bought at a flea market.  When I got home, I saw that the tip was cracked lengthwise.  I sent the tip to Berkley and asked to buy a new one.  They sent back the tip and a whole new rod for free.  Now I've got 2 Series One steelhead baitcasting rods.  One is 8 1/2 feet long and the other is about 6 inches shorter and therefore a bit stiffer...lol.  I don't buy rods because they have a lifetime garantee.  I buy a rod according to my exact needs and budget.  And since I have been fishing a long time, I can feel almost right away at the store if the rod will be ok or not."
