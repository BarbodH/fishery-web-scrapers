Caught a nice 9 pounder on the 09th of the 09th of the 09th!  Measured 28 inches.  I had a couple of weeks of slow fishing, and then one day changed it all.  We had 5 keepers!!!  Here's the largest one.   Most were caught using a Chartreuse single blade spinner and worm, in the Sherman's point area.   bayboy   "
