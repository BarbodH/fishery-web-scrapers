382000,JohnF,2009-09-11 00:35:00,3494,"I want to get a nice spinning rod for finesse type baits. The one I had decided on seems to be hard to find so being the impatient soul I am I thought perhaps a Cumara would serve for the nonce (because it's on the rack and only a little bit more money). Any thoughts pro or con, or suggestions of anything better for the money?  I should have said that I've done a search and read the previous posts about them but most deal more with the trigger rod line, not spinning (except for one person who said theirs broke too easily).

382082,Greencoachdog,2009-09-11 02:57:00,8163,Go Crucial and Stradic!!!... you'll love it!!!
382083,fish-miester,2009-09-11 02:57:00,864,"cumara = a beautiful rod, 2 of my good friends / fishing buddies have them spinning and bait cast .. and let me say.. WOW the things are nice and light and will defenetly do the trick"
382095,timmeh,2009-09-11 03:27:00,609,"I really like St Croix rods myself, and they are similar in price for a nice rod. I have an Avid series which I use for finesse work. For less money the premier series rods are also very nice. I have one of these as well and I honestly can't feel much of a difference between this and the avid."

She just had carpel tunnel surgery so I gave here the lightest rod to use I had, she won't give it back.  Go for it a really nice rod."
382169,ecmilley,2009-09-11 13:41:00,2163,"if you like it get it, it is an awesome rod and will give you years of service, I was going to grab one but ended up with a legend elite st.croix and that was just because the shimano core reel felt more balanced on the croix, but most of the high end stuff feels good"
382178,bigreddog,2009-09-11 14:12:00,84,"Although I don't personally own a Cumara (I prefer 2-piece rods for travel convenience), I think it's difficult to go wrong with Shimano's Cumara line.  On paper, they seem to be a good value for a high-performance rod.  High quality components, light weight and a modern, yet understated appearance, I'm sure it would be a pleasure to fish all day.  Plus, a solid warranty should give you the confidence and peace of mind to fish it aggressively.  And dammit -- you deserve to treat yourself to something nice once in a while.  Am I right?"
382203,JohnF,2009-09-11 16:25:00,3494,"  I just asked me and the unanimous response was a resounding ""YES! Yer worth it.""  JF"
