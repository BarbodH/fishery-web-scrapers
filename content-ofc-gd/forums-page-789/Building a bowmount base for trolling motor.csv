I've attached a pic - basically want to make an aluminum or wooden platform further back from the nose to mount the motor.  Has anyone ever done this? What did you use? How did you mount it to the boat? Looking for suggestions.  cheers,  scugog"

382384,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-12 02:47:00,947,Yea it is perfect.  If you need a bow light and it's the night light your talking about you should be able to buy a socket and get a pole type light or one that folds out of the way  http://www.attwoodmarine.com/store/categor...ting/navigation
382423,SlowPoke,2009-09-12 05:05:00,2984,"    I think ""perfect"" is a bit overstated judging by the overhang at the front of the motor. It looks as though the shaft probably doesn't run anywhere near parallel with the gunwale either.  I'm in south London; bring the boat by tomorrow and we can have a look at it. I'll be working on my boat (new floor & casting deck) and I probably have some scrap aluminium that might help you out.  -Brian"

382458,ccmtcanada,2009-09-12 13:45:00,7971,This is what I did to my boat...should do what you are looking for and it was easy to do and pretty cheap!  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=21165&hl=
