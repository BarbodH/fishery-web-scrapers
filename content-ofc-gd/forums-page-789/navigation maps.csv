382016,skeeter,2009-09-11 01:09:00,1907,go check out HOT MAPS I KNOW PIGEON IS ON IT THERE SITE TELLS YOU ALL the lakes on each card i bought mine at lebaron's
382165,smally21,2009-09-11 13:30:00,993,"i use hot maps and its a great navigation tool.  i also find it works great in conjunction with a good chart.  check out trakmaps trent severn package, it comes in a waterproof tearproof book about 12 by 20.  excellent maps of all kawartha lakes all in one package, saves you going thru giant govt charts that are paper and awful.  photocopy areas you need if you dont want to trash the book.  a little pricey at 150 but it covers the equivalent of 3 or 4 govt charts."
382175,Roy,2009-09-11 13:57:00,13728,Hot Maps only has Pigeon of those three lakes.
382475,Radnine,2009-09-12 15:45:00,1538,Wouldn't Pigeon be covered in the Government charts for the  Trent Severn? I think that I have a set in fact. Jim
382483,Roy,2009-09-12 16:24:00,13728,"Yes Jim, all of the Kawarthas are on there."
