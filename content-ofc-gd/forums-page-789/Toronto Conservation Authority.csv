Read the whole report at www.trca.on.ca     Atlantic Salmon re-introduction Duffins Creek is one of three creeks selected for the release of salmon fry as part of the Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration program. The Atlantic Salmon Restoration program began in 2006 as a partnership between Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, LCBO, Banrock Station Wines, Ontario Sportsfishing Industry Association, Ministry of Natural Resources and TRCA. The goal of the program is to re-establish a sustainable Atlantic Salmon population to Lake Ontario by restoring creek habitat and releasing young salmon (fry) directly into the creek. To date, over 100,000 fry have been released into the Duffins Creek watershed. Key accomplishments in 2008 included the release of 27,000 fry with grade six students, the restoration of 80 metres of eroded shoreline in Greenwood Conservation Area, and the return of adult salmon    Redside dace research Toronto and Region Conservation Authority’s watersheds contain most of the Ontario and Canadian populations of redside dace — a small minnow. They are listed under the new provincial Endangered Species Act. The research TRCA is doing in partnership with the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and University of Toronto (U of T) will inform the “recovery strategy” for this species that is mandated under the provincial Act. The brightly-striped minnow, redside dace, is a Species at Risk within the TRCA jurisdiction. Urban storm water impacts on water quality and quantity, and is the largest threat to this species’ remaining habitat. Toronto and Region Conservation Authority Aquatic Group, in collaboration with the U of T and MNR, is undertaking a five-year project to document changes in redside dace habitat and populations in response to land development. This project will inform the redside dace Recovery Strategy and improve our ability to protect critical habitat. Year two has been completed providing the most comprehensive dataset to-date on redside dace habitat use, their home range and, for the first time, video footage of spawning activity.

Upper Mimico Creek Aquatic Habitat Implementation Upper Mimico Creek Aquatic Habitat Implementation naturalized a degraded urban watershed, portion of Mimico Creek, enhanced wildlife habitat, improved water quality and helped mitigate flood events. The purpose of the Upper Mimico Creek Aquatic Habitat Implementation project is to re-naturalize a portion of the highly urbanized Mimico Creek. In 2008, 580 metres of hard engineered structures were removed and replaced with a natural corridor design, three wetlands were constructed, 900 metres of riparian zone was planted and numerous essential habitat structures were created.  Lake Wilcox Shoreline Restoration Work Lake Wilcox Shoreline Restoration Work naturalized shoreline (in phases) to improve habitat and water quality, enhanced wildlife habitat and improved recreational and educational opportunities for community. In partnership with the Town of Richmond Hill, this project is an extension of the shoreline restoration work done here in 2006 along the north shore of the lake  Greenwood Stream Restoration Greenwood Stream Restoration project was initiated to control and prevent future stream bank erosion while demonstrating the use of soft engineering structures (instead of hard engineering structures such as gabion stone). This project improved water quality, wildlife habitat and fish habitat"
