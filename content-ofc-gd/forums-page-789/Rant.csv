382045,shane,2009-09-11 01:48:00,652,They're politicians. (and most of them used to be lawyers).  The only time they're telling the truth is when they are calling the other party a bunch of liars.  They only look out for #1..............and you ain't even #2.

382092,blarg,2009-09-11 03:16:00,289,"There has got to be something wrong when an area like Toronto votes Liberal almost exclusively, i don't give a damn what anyone has to say about it, but if you honestly believe that the liberals are always the best option then something is wrong with you, or your being bought off.  There is more to life than what can be offered inside suburbia or the concrete jungle, maybe just maybe the opinions of other people in the country, say on the gun registry, actually matters, and maybe just maybe the prevailing opinions of city folks is wrong, imagine that.  But no matter, the whole country is held hostage by leftists in T.O.., seems unfair to me.  O and some of you are right    of course, harper should have let duceppe, layton, and dion take over the government...what the hell is wrong with your head."

382094,Cudz,2009-09-11 03:27:00,2652,I live about 45 mins from Toronto but in these parts we is votin Conservative.
382097,holdfast,2009-09-11 03:31:00,1813,"Hopefully I dont get in trouble for this.  Where you have Immigrants, you have Liberal voters.  Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Vancouver.  Maybe you can also say in the same breath that Big cities Love Liberals if you dont believe the Immigrant Theory.  However, I do think the Liberals knowingly know this, consequently the Immigrant Paranoia towards the Conservatives IE Harpers a Racist.  However, correct me if I'm wrong, because there is allot of untrue and exaggerated stories in the news.  Are the Liberals thinking of allowing our new Canadians to be to vote before they are actually citizens.  I'm sure I heard that on the radio, however it could be false."
382102,Dutchy,2009-09-11 03:57:00,416," As an immigrant I have heard this theory myself a number of times, and I would assume it is correct to a degree. I would not vote conservative, but not because I am an immigrant, because I am not a conservative. I didn't vote that way in Britain, and won't likely here.   But it is a moot point until I get my citizenship next july. So I cannot vote. I have lived in Canada for 6.5 years, paid ALOT in taxes, but cannot vote. So I don't know if that answers the above question. Citizenship at the moment is required to vote.  On the topic of ""I vote Tory cause my dad did and his dad did"", it happens in Britain and in the States. Its nothing unusual, yes it is annoying, but that is the way some people are. If I am being truthful, in Britain right now if I lived there I may vote Tory cause Brown is a disaster and Cameron seems like a decent leader, but it would amount to nothing. I grew up on the river clyde, a ship-building area destroyed by Thatcher and staunchly labour bound. It will never change.  IMO Canada does not need another election. Not right now. There is nothing to be gained and I think if one were held you would get a conservative majority. Which might settle things down politically which would not be a bad thing unless you are a liberal. To my mind all politicians are the same. The major decisions would be made largely the same way whoever was in power, what they screw around with is the smaller things, not less important before anyone hammers me, just smaller issues.  $300 million is alot to waste on doing this whole thing all over again. BUT you may get a majority."
382105,holdfast,2009-09-11 04:17:00,1813,"Just curious here. I believe it may of been late 70s or Early 80s.  I remember our news was always broadcasting news from Britain, Civil Unrest, The whole Country just about Striking, and the Country almost or was Broke.  When was that, What Party was Responsible, How did they get out of it. Just Briefly, sorry if you were too young."
382108,Dutchy,2009-09-11 04:51:00,416," It was the Conservatives. Margaret Thatcher got in eventually and then in the 80's broke the unions. Coal, ship buiding, steel industry. Basically outsourced to asia and killed all the industries. Where I grew up went from dozens of shipyards to one. Loads of people on unemployment, housing benefits. You still cannot mention her name to my dad, he just walks out the room. No-one in the Clyde valley will ever forget her or forgive her. In the shipyards, people went into at 16 years of age, it is all the knew how to do, so when it all went teats up they had no other training to do anything. Who needs a 45 year old welder for example? It cost millions she never factored on, the cost of benefits becuase no-one had a job.  Down in England there were alot of riots in the 80's as well, don't remember exactly what they were about."
382110,holdfast,2009-09-11 05:31:00,1813,"Thanks for the reply.  Remember those strikes, although I was young and didnt care about anything, especially current events."
382160,JohnF,2009-09-11 13:25:00,3494,"This talk about politics reminds me that I've never understood why the Liberals are called liberal, and the Conservatives conservative, like right and left in American politics. I don't think of myself as particularly stupid or unaware but it seems to me the major parties regularly diverge from their respective left/right liberal/conservative tracks, and the minor parties dance to whatever tune might get them some voice by association. For the moment the Green Party may be the one closest to my heart for their sincerity, but sending them to gov't would be like the Maple Leafs signing a 10 year old blueliner (which may be next btw). There have been times when the Liberals seemed far more conservative than the liberal Conservatives, and vice versa.  Strikes me partisan politics has devolved to a simple ""if it's good for him then it's no good for me"" state, and damn the consequences to the electorate and the country. It's now all about getting elected or re-elected, and what party's in power. The campaigning starts the second the election is over, if not sooner. Would that there was as much political energy expended on the state of the country as there is on the state of the party.  Dunno what the solution is though. Honest men and women want no part of rolling in the political manure pile so the political jobs are left to those unfettered by honesty and ethics, or even simple national pride. The parties protect their own and there's little chance of a non-party line aspirant even making it to the ballot under any of the rainbow of party flags let alone being elected. And if by some ridiculous twist of fate they should get to win an election they're either undermined, shouted down and neutralized by all the party faithful, or they just drink the koolaid and break faith with their supporters.  Yours in apathetic beleaguerment JF"
381761,Dara,2009-09-10 12:56:00,3052,"I truly believe that Iggy has a bet with his buddies in the states that he believes Canadians are so gullible and he is so smart that he can run up here and be running the country within say 2 years. Probably has a dollar bet on it or something. Thats what I think he really cares about this country.  And choosing between 2 evils, Harper or Iggy, is still choosing evil. Why spend 300 million for no difference. Lets wait till somebody else shows up to the party. And I don't mean Bob Rae. Although, he is a step above Iggy."

He has no plan for this country, no vision. I don't necesarily agree with the way it has been heading, but at least there was a goal in mind. He is showing off for his American buddies. I can just see them rolling on the floor laughing at him on TV"
381792,TJQ,2009-09-10 14:05:00,7806, Ya know... ya may be right.
381800,alctel,2009-09-10 14:26:00,26," He is basing these new laws on the American system, he also really wants to privatise the prisons. Harper is only taking an interest in Arctic Sovereignty now the ice is melting opening up the North West passage, and he's not doing anything to improve the lives of First Nations people up there - he is just building a couple of shiny new (expensive) boats.   Harper keeps tacking on confidence motions to all the bills he passes. The other parties pass it (no matter how much they dislike it) or an election is called. Then Harper fills the airwaves with stuff about how the other parties are 'making a power grab'    Well thats what the stimulus plan was supposed to do, most of it hasn't got out to people yet due to Harpers cabinet being awful   he didn't say that, he said that the majority of Canadians didn't vote for him, which is true. Only about 35% did.   How has he done a great job? As I said up there he and his cabinet failed to acknowledge there was a serious problem until October, then completely failed to respond to the recession, his finance minster was caught flat out lying about how bad the deficit was, created the largest federal deficit in Canadian history after running on a campaign of no deficits (this is after obliterating the surplus and contingency funds with an ill-advised and cynical GST cut), cut the Charter Challenge fund severely, like Mulroney before him and was caught giving money earmarked for research and green energy stimulus to bail out the Oil Sands companies when they started making a loss. And this is all with the giant head start Canada had on most countries because our banks didn't collapse that's thanks to all the regulation we have (that Harper opposed in 1998)  And that's just financial stuff without even going into how he relaxed environmental planning laws (so that companies now have the power to decide THEMSELVES if they break planning laws), outright LIED about the attempted coalition government last year (he relied on people not knowing how Parliamentary governments work) and sending a memo to senators to intentionally make the senate dysfunctional. i.e. ""forget"" to show up to meetings, schedule meetings during inopportune times, ""lose"" communications, etc.  The worst part is that he prohibits MPs from speaking to constituents and the press in their own words (all communications must be vetted by the PMO), refuses to appear on Canadian news channels citing concerns about ""bias"" and ""unfair coverage"" despite evidence to the contrary, yet appears on the Fox News Channel regularly so its actually really hard to find solid infomation about stuff his governments doing, its all shrouded in secrecy!"
381810,hotrod,2009-09-10 14:51:00,103," I'd like to see some evidence of the contrary. You won't find it on CBC,CTV, The Red Star, The mope and wail or any other msm outlets. Hell the whole wafergate scandal was lies cooked up by the liberal masters of the newspaper publishers to make him look bad. They never report on anything good he does, they only try to make him look bad.I don't blame him for not talking to the media hacks and liberal shills who provide free advertising for them.   I think you need to reread his post.   Well I think that when you have 144 seats and the next closest party has 77 you've beat them. You losers always like to trot out that the majority didn't vote for him by combining the votes of all the other parties, the same could be said about pretty well all the PM's  and that's the way it works. I had to sit through years of that liar chretien who only got in because the vote on the right was split you could say the same thing about that crook.  You can't have it both ways.... the PM can't be responsible for the recession and not be responsible for the recovery. That's lefty logic.....doesn't make sense.  You can say that both parties are the same but they aren't......one stole millions from taxpayers and the other did not."
381811,Headhunter,2009-09-10 14:51:00,5703,"A little humour!  I asked my friend's little girl what she wanted to be when she grows up. She said she wanted to be Prime Minister of Canada some day. Both of her parents, NDP supporters, were standing there, so I asked her, ""If you were Prime Minister what would be the first thing you would do?""  She replied, ""I'd give food and houses to all the homeless people."" Her parents beamed, and said, ""Welcome to the NDP Party!""  ""Wow...what a worthy goal!"" I told her. I continued, ""But you don't have to wait until you're Prime Minister to do that. You can come over to my house, mow the lawn, pull weeds, and sweep my yard, and I'll pay you $50. Then I'll take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out. You can give him the $50 to use toward food and a new house.""  She thought that over for a few seconds, then she looked me straight in the eye and asked,  ""Why doesn't the homeless guy come over and do the work, and you can just pay him the $50?""  I smiled and said, ""Welcome to the Conservative Party.""  Her parents still aren't speaking to me. HH"
381915,alctel,2009-09-10 21:35:00,26," You really can't be argueing that a PM and cabinent that refuses to talk to the press and does all its dealing in secret is a GOOD thing? Really?  And as for bias, Canada has one of the most right wing media in the Western World and it ranks extremely low on the free press ranking - 90% of print media and almost all radio and TV stations are owned by one of two familys. Harper gets away with SO MUCH and hardly any of it is reported on, instead non-stories like the wafer thing gets brought up (which was a load of crap by the way, he was put in a terrible position and I would have done the same thing in his place). The CBC is pretty much the saving grace at the moment, but its had to fire a bunch of journalists due to having its budget cut recently so the news quality is going to go downhill.    The difference is that the BQ, Greens, NDP and even the liberals are a lot closer to each other than the Conservatives, and especially Harper (who was a Reform party member and pretty much the furthest right PM Canada's ever had)   He wasn't responsible for it, I never said that. That was stupid free-market advocates in the US and greedy banks slashing the regulations regarding loans that were in place since the 30's depression (to stop things like this happening again).  He DID make it far worse by cutting GST RIGHT before the recession draining all the emergency funds, and then completely screwing up the stimulus package which meant we are only just limping out of it, despite not having any of our banks collapse. Not to mention the finance minister lying about where the money went, certain places not getting stimulus funds because 'harper doesn't like them' (actual quote about why Toronto got virtually nothing), etc etc      Well the conservatives took large amounts of money ear-marked for green energy projects and northern first nation communities and just gave it to their oil sand buddies in Alberta. As well as calling a 300million election weeks after promising not to do so. Does that count as stealing?    This was an old Republican joke from America, nice to see it got this side of the border eventually. If she really would have wanted to join the conservative party she would have given the homeless man $5 to do her chores, and kept the 45 bucks for herself, spent it all on jewellery and then complained how lazy the homeless man was."
381922,Cookslav,2009-09-10 21:52:00,1457," With all due Respect... I would guess thats the exact response most western folk would expect from us Southern Ontarians LOL!  In truth the system ""seems"" fair to us I suppose but in reality there is a vast difference in how people feel on platforms & issue from the 2 respective areas. I can totaly see how frustrating it could be to see 90 of the west voting Blue based only to see the red win time and time again. These people are neighbors, friends, family, and co-workers who talk politics together, and share common ideals...ideals that may not be popular in the GTA So to see their entire area/province/ Western Canadas votes overturned by one very small geographical area its not hard to see where the frustration might fester. I'm not saying I have the answers but I can understand their frustration with a populus vote in the GTA running the country. The east feels it just as much and Quebec....well they don't help the situation at all when they vote for the Bloq.  Sure we have more people living here in Ontario so I guess the majority rules, but its a dangerous game to make the west feel alienated when it comes to how we're governed....there are seperatist Parties gaining stength out there as well because they are not being represented.  I wish I had the solution but I don't have it. I just know telling the West to get over it might be a bit insensitive."

I provided plenty of examples for you of lefty bias and you only agree that the cbc is leftist. wow.   This is you saying it was his fault now you are saying it wasn't what you said. I think you need to read your own words in post 30. Yo learn your lessons well from your liberal idols. Kinda like bob rae saying iggy never supported the coalition, when his signature is on the document.   No, it doesn't count as stealing and let's see some proof that the money went to personal friends of the PM, there was plenty in adscam. You just pull things out of a hat like a typical lefty and you think if you say it enough times it will be true.

Thats why they bought the 'COILITION GOVERNEMTS ARE UNANTURAL AND A POWER GRAB' line last year and repeated it, despite colilition governments being extremely common in parlimentary systems. No one calls him out on his lies, at all, otherwise they will lose all access to the government. If you want me to reference your examples, the red star is hardly a msm outlet, and the Globe and Mail and CTV are both owned by CTVglobemedia which bankrolls right-wing candidates and has ties to the Fraser Institute which is what I was saying before.  The CBC isn't particularly leftist either.   Read what I said again - he didn't cause the global recession, but he sure as hell made it a lot worse for Canada. Also I am not a liberal and won't be voting for them, please stop presuming that I am! I especially don't like Iggy    Well please start picking my arguments apart then if they are so full of holes, especially about how Harpers cabinet mismanaged the recession economy and then lied about it repeatedly  Also explain what you mean by 'typical lefty' 'typical lib' etc, since you use that almost every sentence"

You don't think that perhaps, just maybe, possibly, on occasion, or even quite often....the opposition goes out of its way to make it difficult for them? LOL... Its a minority government...would the PC's make it easy had the situation been reversed last time around? Harper is doing a pretty bang up jon in a what many would easily classify as a disfunctional Parliment.  One thing I do know is the Fiberals were SO desperate to get back in they were willing to share the bed with SEPERATISTS.... Ya.... Who else will they jump in bed with for their own personal gain? Allthough I do not want an election I invite it... If Iggy pulls the plug Canada will hang him out to dry...mark my words, thats right...I said mark 'em Quote me, write it down and if I'm wrong hang me out to dry and mock me all you want. The liberal Minorty is a vocal one, but they are still a minority and should he pull the plug we'll see the same result. So if Iggy wants to waste another couple million dollars of tax payers money to seal his fate in politics I say let him try. with a little luck the PC will get even more seats.   Bingo...this is exactly what Most canadians are thinking when they hear election rumors. We think of the last escapade with the SEPERATISTS. We're tired of the LIBERALS....

The grasshopper thinks he's a fool, and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The shivering grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.  THE END   THE CANADIAN VERSION:  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool, and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. So far, so good, eh?  The shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others less fortunate, like him, are cold and starving.  The CBC shows up to provide live coverage of the shivering grasshopper, with cuts to a video of the ant in his comfortable warm home with a table laden with food.  Canadians are stunned that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so while others have plenty.  The NDP, the CAW and the Coalition Against Poverty demonstrate in front of the ant's house. The CBC, interrupting an Inuit cultural festival special from Nunavut with breaking news, broadcasts them singing ""We Shall Overcome.""  Sven Robinson rants in an interview with Pamela Wallin that the ant has gotten rich off the backs of grasshoppers, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his ""fair share"".  In response to polls, the Government drafts the Economic Equity and Grasshopper Anti-Discrimination Act, retroactive to the beginning of the summer.  The ant's taxes are reassessed, and he is also fined for failing to hire grasshoppers as helpers.  Without enough money to pay both the fine and his newly imposed retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.  The ant moves to the US, and starts a successful agribiz company.  The CBC later shows the now fat grasshopper finishing up the last of the ant's food, though Spring is still months away, while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he hasn't bothered to maintain it.  Inadequate government funding is blamed, Roy Romanow is appointed to head a commission of enquiry that will cost $10,000,000.  The grasshopper is soon dead of a drug overdose, the Toronto Star blames it on the obvious failure of government to address the root causes of despair arising from social inequity.  The abandoned house is taken over by a gang of immigrant spiders, praised by the government for enriching Canada's multicultural diversity, who promptly set up a marijuana grow op and terrorize the community.  THE END"
382021,canadianboy,2009-09-11 01:12:00,83,ok im quite enjoying these valid points but lets face it almost all politicians take big kickbacks and appoint their buddy's in high paying positions. lets face it if i was pm and there was a senate seat open and my best fishing buddy was just fired from his job i would try to slip him in there. the part that annoys me is that almost all politicians take kickbacks to accept contracts for their departments  example  400 needs to be repaved they might not tender offers saying that the company has an excelent track record and the work needs to be done asap the costs then explode to three times the original estimates the length of time of construction is double the estimated time frame to make up this money governments make people buy FISHING LICENCES and we all get screwed paying way to much income tax and we get stuck in traffic when we are all just trying to make it over to BPS

(one can hope)"
381659,alctel,2009-09-10 02:44:00,26," Harper keeps releasing confidence motions when parliment votes on bills. The other parties either have to pass the bill (which most of the time they, along with 60% of the country dislike) or by law an election is called.  I think Harpers government has completely smashed the record, they are supposed to be used in dire emergencies only but he is calling them on EVERYTHING...   I HATE HATE Harper and the mess he has got Canada into, but he is damn good at getting his own way considering that he only gets 35% of the vote, he is an excellent politician, even if he is a terrible leader.   Actually it pretty much his fault that it was so bad. Canada had a 'recession fund' of reserve money stashed away so if the worst came to the worst we could spend our way out of it. Harper decides to cut the GST by 2%, which drains all the money we had saved and then 6 months later the recession happened. He then tries to pass a TERRIBLE stimulus plan that does almost nothing and his finance minister is caught lying about how much debt Canada is actually in. If he'd actually done nothing it would be an improvement.  The only reason that it wasn't even worse is that our banks were fine, due to extremely strong regulation which was put in place in the 40's and 50's. Harper and his conservative colleagues tried to get rid of these regulations a few years back (believing in the power of the free market), but luckily failed, otherwise our banks would be collapsing all over the place just like the US.  And don't even get me started on how he waived environmental laws and protections so the oil sands can carry on poisoning SK, manitoba and Northern Ontario"
381662,holdfast,2009-09-10 02:50:00,1813," Are you talking about the same Iggy that Flip/Flops.  The Guy that never paid Canadian taxes for 26 Years.  All he talks about is his Resume, His Books. The Guy when questioned on his Policies, he says .YOU WAIT AND SEE.  Ill vote and hope for the Guy thats been called a Racist, War Monger, Bushlover, The Guy that got us into Afghanistan, he wears Sweaters, Has Hidden Agendas, but Horror of Horrors, Pockets the Biscuit instead of eating it during a funeral. I forgot, wants to take the Arts away from Quebecers.   Hes my man, just hope his get tough on crime Policies start getting through once the opposition is out of the way."
381666,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-10 02:53:00,0,...and i hope you learn when you're supposed to use capital letters!
381668,alctel,2009-09-10 02:54:00,26," His 'tough on crime' policy is a travesty - they tried that stuff in the US and look what happened - crime rate through the roof, massive expenses on prison and 1 in 10 males have done time at some point! Mandatory minimum sentences DO NOT WORK and in fact make things a lot worse in most cases - there is a mountain of data from other countries that support this.  edit: not to say that Iggy doesn't suck - he does but he is better (barely) than Harper  edit2: I LOVE talking about politics by the way, and no offence is meant to anyone"
381673,hotrod,2009-09-10 03:04:00,103," So that means it's his fault that we're coming out of this in better shape than most western countries then? what would Iggy have done different other than to spend more? as has been said earlier you can't have it both ways.   I don't think so, the reason the banks collapsed in the States was because the Dems (Barney Fwank) forced the banks to give mortgages to people who could never pay them. Thankfully we don't have socialists running our country like they do down south now. I believe in the free market and don't look to the gov't to wipe my ass and feed me."
381675,holdfast,2009-09-10 03:12:00,1813," Read on Buddy.  I agree we need these Bills.  As far as being like the Americans.  Typical Whacky lefty reaction.  Read on Buddy http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianp...81COa1o4pM5Z9cQ By the way, Im amused that you love Lurking at my comments."
381678,holdfast,2009-09-10 03:16:00,1813,"LOL    Im sorry DR, if your talking about me.  My fat Fingers got used to feeling for trip wires and fuses in sand and snow instead of the key board,  thanks for bringing that up, Ill try my best to be as good as you."
381679,alctel,2009-09-10 03:17:00,26," We came out of it better despite Harper, not because of him. Like I said, if he'd managed to shoot down the regulations that we have on our banks then we'd been in deep deep trouble.   No, what happened is that they got rid of all the banking regulations that stopped predatory loans, allowing the banks to go hog wild and give terrible advice and terrible mortgages to people. These were designed with deceptively low rates at first, that then got jacked up 4 to 5 times the original interest rate. People couldn't pay them and defaulted, so banks packaged up all these 'high risk' loans and sold them to other banks, who packaged them up with other similar toxic assists and sold them back, effectively creating money out of thin air.  When enough people lost their house the entire thing came crashing down and the 'invisible money' vanished (or more exactly, it never existed). It was entirely the fact that the 'free market' was allowed to run rampant that caused the collapse in the first place. Canada avoided the giant banking collapse that followed because our banks are heavily regulated by the government, and weren't allowed to give out such predatory loans.  The US is nowhere near socialist, AT ALL, they have a terrible terrible privatised health and prison system (which noone else in the developed world has) and the fact that all the right wing talking heads are spouting that is pretty sad, since they have no idea what the word means obviously.   That link just says that they are trying to force the bill through. I'll dig up some reports from around the world that show mandatory minimum sentences are terrible ideas. (for example the proposed legislation means that if you are caught with a certain about of marijuana (I think a 1/4?) its automatic jail time. Do you really think thats a good idea?)   Thanks for the discussion by the way!"
381682,bigugli,2009-09-10 03:21:00,6138,""" Soldier "" or ""sailor""  have been dirty words in this country since the early 60's.  Same goes for other words like ""duty"", ""honour"", ""loyalty"" or ""patriotism"". Nothing new in that."
381700,POLLIWOGG,2009-09-10 03:53:00,835,Isn't it today that it goes to court to see if the last election was legal? I think it is and if it is decided that the PM broke the law how much jail time do you think he'll get? It was a smart move he campaigned for about a year before calling the election and then had everybody so pissed at him and his personal attacks that he had to beg for a time out.
381702,holdfast,2009-09-10 03:57:00,1813, Yea a waste of Tax Payers money. A Coalition of citizens ( Lefties) taking our elected Prime Minister to a Kangaroo court with the tax Payers money.  That is Pretty desperate.
381707,holdfast,2009-09-10 04:16:00,1813," Your Marijuana example is over exaggerated as usual from the opponents.  Lets try raising sexual consent to a minority from 14 to 16.  I think it has passed already thanks to Stockwell Day.  Can you imagine someone having legal sex with your daughter of 14.  That is absurd.  One of the bills held up by the opposition is the curbing the power of judges to sentence convicted criminals to house arrest rather than jail time on a variety of more serious crimes.  No your Maryjane example is not one of them. We are talking about Breaking and Entering (see how you feel if your place of safety and you have been violated) Auto theft, and Violent sexual offenses.  These are all thought out Bills that the lefties criticism is what you have mentioned.  Oh my God, we'll be like the Americans.  Also there is another Bill for automatic prison time to 10 years in serious cases.  All in all, at this time there are too many criminals getting away with murder with no deterrent because of our current criminal system.  At Least he has done something.  Did I mention Arctic Sovereignty thanks to your Global Warming Panic or Prediction. Yea your right.

If they screw it up then I'll consider that next time around.  If Iggy wants to go to the polls it'll be a mistake.

381731,bigfish1965,2009-09-10 11:31:00,3382," No...he didn't. Most Canadians voted against him. He called the last election moments after he made it illegal to do so. How on earth does that make him even remotely credible? The regionalism on both sides is very dangerous. The PQ should be forced to have the expense of running in the majority of Canadian ridings just like all other parties. The west needs to get over their paranoia of Toronto. Our seats are representative of population, which seems the fairest way to do it. If the PC's cannot get a foothold there against what is left of the Liberals, they are doing something wrong. As TJ said, our parties are so homogenised they are of very little difference."

No he has not proved to be a Racist, No he will not Arm all Canadians, No he will not move Ottawa to Edmonton, Hes probably seen Obama more than Bush. No he will not stop immigration, mabe toughen it I hope."

We are lucky to be able to have this right and to exercise however we chose. in other countries people dream of this and in this country we seem to treat doing our patriotic duty like a chore. We are lucky to live in such a great and free land stop complaining  ps- not saying its anyone on OFC just the public in general

Nothing really changes who ever gets in anyways.

381504,wallyboss,2009-09-09 23:37:00,1095,I wouldn't mind the 300 millions tag on a new election if it actually made a difference.   but the last 2 elections we ended up with the same results as we went in to the elections.  But it still cost us a bundle.  I am tired of voting for the less of 2 evils.

381518,canadianboy,2009-09-09 23:54:00,83,who knows what could happen it just aggrivates me that people will say they are extremly patriotic and will get all into for any national sporting (team canada hockey) event yet they cant just suck it up and do their civic duty and vote. we live in a country where i think we should sit back and reflect upon the fact over a hundred soldiers have lost their lives in the current mission and thousands before them in other military action to defend this country and our rights and we just dont show enough appriciation

There are Soldiers in Theatre that read those Posts.  There are computer terminals for Entertainment when they do get a chance,  Its just sickening and downright Treasonistic on those comments.  As far as Duty to vote and how lucky we are.  Any Soldier that's been overseas will tell ya, Gad, is that ALL YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS VOTING?
