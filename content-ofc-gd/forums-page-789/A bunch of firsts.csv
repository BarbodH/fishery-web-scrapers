Of course I brought the BPS and call because goose season just opened and I wanted to check out a bay.  The geese were there but too close to someones property so I left the gun in it's case and kept the motor in the water.  While cruising down the river I thought Wayne was gonna come for a visit.   We then decided to do a little trolling in an area that I stumbled upon a few years back.  Nobody fishes here yet...   I managed to hook up with something just as my lure had passed a waypoint I marked three years ago, I guess I'll keep that one.  I got it to about 20 feet of the boat and it shook off.  My guess is that it was a walley?  Only because I have never caught anything else there.  As we trolled over a couple of other waypoints, Mel hooked into something.  Just at dusk so I could not see that well.  She managed to get it to the boat.   Turned out to be a huge eye.  28"" and almost six pounds.  This was Mel's first walleye and the first eye in the Lund (had it for a year).  We trolled for a little longer but got nothing.  Now it is dark and the geese were flying over us.  Of course the gun stayed put, but I figured I would try some calling.  I managed to get my call to work like I have never been able to.  Really good sound and fluctuation.  I managed to get a couple to change there path but not for long.  Being in a boat with the motor going in the middle of the river they figured out quick that I was not a goose  What a great evening to be out.  Now hopefully this luck continues for the BOQ GTG!!!!!"
