381771,Bernie,2009-09-10 13:21:00,3190,"I have some OFC""ers coming up this weekend for a fishing trip. Seems I can't message multiple people anymore so I thought I would post it here. The forecast is looking great with cloudy periods and highs in the mid twentys. I haven't fished at all this summer due to some ongoing renos around the place. May try tonite if time allows to see if I can still pull some out. See you guys soon."
381793,Roy,2009-09-10 14:06:00,13728,"Dang, I guess the invite got lost in the mail Bernie! Have a super time!"

381819,LucG,2009-09-10 15:18:00,779,"Yeah, we're finally getting our summer! I spent the entire long weekend on Nipissing. It seems the walleye are starting to be a little more active as well. Good luck and have a fun weekend!"
381828,Bernie,2009-09-10 15:46:00,3190,"Roy I would be glad to have you visit sometime. Show me how to troll for those ""big ones"" that keep jumping in my bay."

381868,Terry,2009-09-10 19:08:00,14456,"yeah, I thinking I'm not on that list too......LOL  have fun guys"
381874,Greencoachdog,2009-09-10 19:29:00,8163,Do you need me to bring anything from the States?

381881,kickingfrog,2009-09-10 19:52:00,8333," Eyes or bass Bernie? I don't think I""ll be making it up to my uncle's this fall either way, but I can still dream."
381882,Bernie,2009-09-10 19:54:00,3190,  Does anyone fish for bass?
381883,Spiel,2009-09-10 19:55:00,9065,"Yah yah, rub it in."
381885,kickingfrog,2009-09-10 19:57:00,8333,Hey! My avatar is a bass I caught in Greening's Bay in the fall.
382050,fishnsled,2009-09-11 01:56:00,3520,"Hey Bernie,  I can't send to multiple people as well, mods?  Forecast looks great.  Looking forward to some good times and lots of laughs, maybe a fish or two as well  .  Still in limbo as to my departure, pm coming with the details."
382073,kickingfrog,2009-09-11 02:32:00,8333,  I think the board was having some spam pms getting through a few weeks ago and one way to thwart them was disabling the feature.
382118,Spiel,2009-09-11 11:15:00,9065," Correct, mass PM'ing was disabled."
