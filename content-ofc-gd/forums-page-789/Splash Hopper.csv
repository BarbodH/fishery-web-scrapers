381434,splashhopper,2009-09-09 21:25:00,2931,that's a great toon...  I never really appreciated it until 2000 when I was back in Moosomin for my grandfathers funeral though...  That song came on the radio and the guys I was riding with started singing it...  And then I heard Randy mention the town I was born in....lol  Now i love it...  thanks for the video bro...  Real glad to see you on the board again...  When is your next report coming out?  I always enjoy your back country expeditions.   Splashhopper

I sometimes wish my own father had ... but nooooo..  he stopped for a few beers in Moosomin and as my mom says:  "" instead of me being a tall dark German boy, I am a short assed little drunk(sober now though)...lol"
