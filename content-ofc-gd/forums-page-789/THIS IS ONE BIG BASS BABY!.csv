382014,Fishing 24/7,2009-09-11 01:07:00,709,Well i got off ealy from work today.  Got online and saw that my cousin was online so i shoot him a message.  DUDE tell your boss your taking the rest of the day off.  Because he works at the gouverment he was able to leave at 2 pm.  we get to our spot at around 3pm.  Beeing new to the flipping and pitching technique.  i told myself ill try this all day if i have too.  IT FINALY PAYED OFF BIG TIME!!    BASSO WAS HIS NAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!    picking up the beast!    This pig was a brute!    21'' of pure health! not a mark on her.    GOT GIRTH???    on this picture you can realy tell its a HOG!    continued the day on the flip and i wasent disapointed.    got this nice one right befor leaving.    then this small one decides he wants a piece of the action.  to tell you the truth.  i missed one that was about 4 lbs and some change right at the boat.  gatta set that hook harder i guess.  or put my drag to the max!  All and all IM VERY happy with what im seeing so far .  PITCH AND FLIP.  FOR THE WIN!

382044,jaydub,2009-09-11 01:48:00,145,"Awesome bucket dude!  That first pic is great, makes it look massive!  I know there's been some discussion about weighing fish and scales being inaccurate on OFC today but I'm curious if you did weigh that baby?  If so can you post it just for kicks?"
382048,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-11 01:52:00,3761,"YES You finally got the job done man! Great catch, did you get a exact weight on that monster? I like the pic in the water, it's mouth doesn't look huge when compared to its wide body.  Really a great catch bro!  Looks like your part of the 5lbs + Largemouth Club buddy, glad to have you aboard!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"

382153,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-09-11 12:57:00,0,WOW! Another monster bass! Me and snagmaster have been smashing alot of nice bass on flip and jgs. Yesterday we got into a school of smallies on a deep weedline. Sept and October are the best times to use it since the big fish will be putting on the feed bag! Thanks for sharing.
