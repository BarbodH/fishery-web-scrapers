381246,rylan,2009-09-09 14:58:00,134,"The baiting, is not to bring them,it,s to keep them around. Once the week before the hunt rolls around(oct 1st),the feeder will no longer be filled. It,s just to see whats there.    I understand that this is the effect you want. BUT-- the older ans smarted deer will connect the food to human. Then they will move deeper into the woods, making it harder for everyone to bag the big one. Baiting works great if you are after the smaller deer. As I said, not to be a bug- and please research the effectiveness."
381406,misfish,2009-09-09 20:40:00,29133,"  Thanks for your input Monsterman. I will try like you say. I have three stands in the area I hunt.Adding a fourth. Basicly covering each corner of the property. Maybe putting the feeder in the middle of the bush is a better location?  As for other hunters,it,s just myself,and a guest if there is one. It,s private property.  The owner of the land has seen 2 big bucks now anlonf with 2 smaller ones and three does. I,t just myself and mrs,s that will be eating the kill,so a bigg,n would be to much for us. Yes I do share the kill with the land owner.  Thanks again for your input. Much thanks for that."
381549,Daplumma,2009-09-10 00:41:00,1961,"Food plots however are legal here.Do you have access to the land to make a plot over the summer?Very effective for drawing them in and improving racks.Does not do much for the quality here because the land is cut up into 30 acre or less lots.Any decnt rack that wanders onto the wrong lot is dispatched and will not grow another year.I tried a plot once and my goats loved it.Best of luck this season,bud. Joe"
382202,misfish,2009-09-11 16:23:00,29133,"Instead of starting a new thread,I thought I would just keep adding to this one til the day I get one.Save space aswell.   Decided  booked the day off to finish up on the stands. The time is closing fast.  Taking the advise from Monsterman,I took my homemade climber deep into the woods. Looked for the perfect tree,cleared some shooting lanes, and there ya go. Done. It,s nice to know, you can leave your stuff behind,and not get stolen.    I  have one ladderstand that I was never really getting a positive feeling about it,s location,so I went and took it down,loaded it up and went a searching.    Knowing the new corn crop (natural feed plot) would for sure be a great bet for the afternoon hunts after work.I went for a walk along the trees edge. Seeing old rubs from last year,I just needed to find the right location.I start to look for a suitable spot. Close to the field,and close to a corner entrance. While looking for that ""spot"" I came accross down corn and a bedding.      Looking for a good solid tree to setup on,I found one just in the bush abit.Cleared some sapplings,trim some branches,and up she went. I like the view,and I am very CONFIDENT, about this spot.    The patch between the trees and corn,the land owner and I, are going to plow it up and plant clover.    As for the feeder,it was empty again,and almost ripped off the tree.  Big deer tracks around. Im getting jacked up now. Til the next report. Straight shoot,n."
382208,richyb,2009-09-11 17:05:00,774,Looks like a great spot. That corn that is down would likely be coons. I took a walk today around the area i hunt and found lots of beds aswell. Man is the season ever sneaking up on us.
382213,misfish,2009-09-11 17:38:00,29133," Yep coons,but the tracks were there.  Should add,this is the spot I have shot my turkeys,and the same spot where I took the vid of the two deer this spring."
382220,richyb,2009-09-11 18:18:00,774,"Is that a home made ladder stand ? if it is , what was the cost of material?  thanks"
382228,misfish,2009-09-11 19:12:00,29133," I make all my own stuff. Made it at work.SHHHHHHH  The cost was 1/2 of what a store bought was,and it,s stronger. 1""square tube.125 wall.1""angle for the step part,and the mesh was just lying around the shop. It,s 17 ft.I have another that is 21 ft and a 15 ft.   21ft scares me.LOL Higher then you think."
382232,richyb,2009-09-11 19:21:00,774,21ft scares me.LOL Higher then you think.    LOL ya me too. My ladder is 15. at max ill put my portable about 20. One of the guys I hunt with I wont even go in his stands. He figures higher is better and hes got a few over 30 ( F -THAT !!). He wonders why he misses all the time
382311,misfish,2009-09-11 23:07:00,29133," 30 ft is a bit much. If you were thinking of a new stand,pm me.Im sure we could work something out."
378078,misfish,2009-08-30 17:00:00,29133,"Headed to my hunting area this morning to set up the feeder (that I seen in the OOD mag a couple of months back) Apon arrivial,I was greeted with a young broud of turkeys. It was funny watching the litle ones in the high grass trying to keep up with mother.   Top right corner of the pic.   Get parked and get the feed  ready and my clearing blade out for my trek in.    The next few pics are the walk in. It,s alot differnt looking with all the green.          The misquitos were brutal.Must of gotten bit about 100 times it felt like.  Got the feeder set and filled. Also put out a apple salt block.    Once that was all set,I was off to start a new tree stand. This location had alot of traffic last fall.I was ground hunting the area,but knew a tree stand would be a better bet.Got it half done,the the sky opened up with a down pour. I,ll head up again this week to finish it.  Some shot of the area . There are three corner entrances.           The ajoining field was loaded with geese. It wont be long now til I get a chance to pop some of them.  One more month to go. Getting primed."
378082,Skud,2009-08-30 17:05:00,739,Where did you pick up that clearing blade Brian?
378087,misfish,2009-08-30 17:11:00,29133," Doug Picked it up at BPS. 19 BUCKS. It,s made by Gerber. I was very impressed with it. The saw is very sharp and the blade is very strong."
378090,danbo,2009-08-30 17:21:00,2646,Killer!...     ( save me some tail-feathers please.)
379922,tinbanger,2009-09-04 19:17:00,1028,"Nice spot .  headed into our camp in 2 weekends , more of a work weekend what with bridge repairs and some drainage issues around the camp. hope to check out a few of the trails as well.  won't be long"
380146,Beans,2009-09-05 14:17:00,3339,"That bucket of bait looks like the ""chicken scratch"" we use in our ground bait for carp...LOL"
380494,misfish,2009-09-07 15:29:00,29133," Thats cracked corn there Norm. Heard that whole corn is better so thats what I loaded up with today. Was out this morning checking on things. The feeder along with the two piles I did last sunday were totally gone. Right down to the bottom of the feeder. Some good tracks and lots of turkey scratching. Wish I had bought that trail cam that was on sale at BPS last week. Was going to head down now,but it,s monday and the hwy is already getting nuts."
380514,bucktail,2009-09-07 17:20:00,1857,Put my tree stands out on Saturfay Brian. Spooked two turkeys out of the same spot. Someone has to invent a better way to put up tree stands....Im getting older and it almost killed me in the heat this year. Used one of those climbing slings but still dont trust it enough to relax in it.
380537,dave524,2009-09-07 18:47:00,4508," I know there is absolutely no intent to break the law on your part and chances of the geese finding that bait in the wooded area are remote but you might want to consider the distance from your bait station to your goose setup. Technically if a C.O. or RCMP officer wanted to push it you could be found in violation of the Migratory Game Bird Act.  Quote  BAIT RESTRICTIONS  14. (1) Subject to section 23.3, no person shall hunt for migratory game birds within 400 m of any place where bait has been deposited unless the place has been free of bait for at least seven days.  Just a thought for you to consider"
380540,richyb,2009-09-07 19:09:00,774,I got a trail cam last week and put it infront of my dads stand. Checked it lastnight and have pics of a doe and a small 6 point buck. Cant wait for the hunt.
380547,misfish,2009-09-07 20:38:00,29133,"  400 meters eh. The feeder is in the bush(not sure about you,but I never seen any geese flying into a bush area),and the field the geese were in,is not even close to 400.   TY for your concern. I do know the laws of hunting.  Rich I,ll be getting one this week. I gots to know."
380548,richyb,2009-09-07 20:45:00,774,The cam I got was only like 99$ at crappy tire. Its a bushnell and seems to take decent pics.   My buddy has his trail cam (moultrie) by my stand and got a pic of this beauty 
380567,chinookhunter,2009-09-07 22:14:00,68,cool
380575,misfish,2009-09-07 22:33:00,29133,You just saved me a drive Rich.TY  Some nice animals in both pics.

380930,misfish,2009-09-08 21:32:00,29133," Well you did save me a drive Rich,you did not save me grief.LOL Bought one today,then the DS ,and the bloody thing wouldnt program.  Took it back."
380982,richyb,2009-09-09 00:16:00,774,which one did you buy? and whats the ds ?
380989,misfish,2009-09-09 00:28:00,29133,"Bought the $99 special like you said. The DS I bought at Shoppers. 4 mg. The camera takes 2-4 mg chip. I followed the directions. Once it came time to put the pass word,it was stopped.   I,ll head there with my chip and batterys and try it before I buy it. AGAIN"
380994,richyb,2009-09-09 00:34:00,774,goodluck with a different one. Im just itching to get back out there and see what else i have pics of but im going to wait untill friday. Atleast then you know what kind of deer are in the area and time they are travelling.
380996,rylan,2009-09-09 00:39:00,134,"Sorry to be a bug,  but maybe you should research the effectiveness of baiting. I do think if you look hard enough you will find the it has the wrong effect of what you are trying to do. In my many years in the bush, I have found that it makes the hunt harder, not only for you but anyone hunting that area as well. As we know deer are VERY smart- they will catch on and then move deeper in the woods and therefore, giving your hunting location only small, young deer. What I would do, which is alot more hard is Bait areas away from your location, keeping the big deer closer. Good luck. It is worth it!!!!!"
381000,Daplumma,2009-09-09 00:52:00,1961,I had no idea it was legal to bait anywhere.Big no no down here.Hope you fill up the freezer bud. Joe
381036,misfish,2009-09-09 01:22:00,29133,"The baiting, is not to bring them,it,s to keep them around. Once the week before the hunt rolls around(oct 1st),the feeder will no longer be filled. It,s just to see whats there.  This is my first time with a feeder. Got the idea from OOD."
381136,Joey,2009-09-09 03:25:00,9122,That's interesting stuff B.  I had no idea about baiting or scouting areas.  Guess I'm not much into the hunting thing.  I'll be interested to see how you do this season.  Keep us posted.  Joey
