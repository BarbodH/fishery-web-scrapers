The day started off tough while we moved to deeper water without a fish being moved.After the waves kicked up a bit we made the decision to move to shallower water with it paying off with two fish being caught in two passes,,,lowe and behold the only fish,,,ol' dad did a great job netting the fish and the rest is all history,,,A win out of a tough day!!  Some teams got skunked with no team having more then two fish,ours were just bigger!!  A couple pics of the ceremony!    winning teams!  Ohh ya,,,now tomorrow for the skyway salmon challange,,,,hoping to go two for two!!"
