Anyway, my one reprieve is my annual tourney with the boys this weekend.  It'll be our first trip to Nipissing (Greening Bay Cottages near Callander).  Just looking for any helpful advice.  Bass/Pike/Walleye are the quarry - length criteria so pike is the prime target if available.  If you won't give up your hot spots I'll take any tips you might have for patterns this time of year.  Appreciate any help you can offer.  Cheers,  MOB"

In most areas you could not see your lure only inches under the surface of the water. Not sure if it has disipated or if this affects fishing, but you might have to consider hitting the open water."

Personally I don't know what doesn't work as long as you find them. Tubes, grubs, small worms, crayfish cranks, top waters, minnow baits, spinner baits.  Lots a shoals, lots of bass."
381972,hotrod,2009-09-10 23:43:00,103,The smallies have been really slow the last while but the buckets have been on fire! Dad was out by Lavigne today and said there was an algae bloom starting there also but I don't think you'll be running there from where you are.
382038,Joey,2009-09-11 01:45:00,9122,"I've fished Nippissing a few times this year.  The only tip I can give you is large lures = large fish, especially the pickerel.  The pike will hit anything, even lures bigger than themselves.  Seriously, pike never die, they just swim around with pieces missing and hit anything near them  Joey"

I'd try for the smallies right in Greenings to see if they are biting before I'd run there, they can't stay slow forever. Good pike down there in South Bay also."
