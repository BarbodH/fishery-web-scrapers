Joe"
381545,Greencoachdog,2009-09-10 00:37:00,8163," Cigarette butts make excellent mulch!!!.. they retain tons of moisture under dry conditions doncha yanno!!!!  If you're going to squawk aboot something, squawk aboot the fact that you can't catch fish in Virginny... therefore you have no reports!!!  ... it sux to be you eh???... how are Pops, Miss Becky, and my Poodle doing???"
381551,Daplumma,2009-09-10 00:43:00,1961,WE are all good.Had a good feed of fried okra and catfish last week.Got a few nice ones jug fishing with Art and Pops.I haven't had my boat out since Lakair last year. Joe
381552,Mattones,2009-09-10 00:44:00,587,Work is slow and im back doing landscaping for a few weeks and every time before starting work we have to walk around picking up garbage in the complex or apartment. One one guy at a corner unit must smoke 1 pack a day on his porch. We come once a week to landscape the complex and every where there are 100+ on his lawn.  Its disgusting How hard is it to put them in a waterbottle or something.
381553,misfish,2009-09-10 00:45:00,29133,"We had an ole fella here that picked up every butt on the off ramp at Bayfield and made a pile out of them. Who cared?????????? The news did,but now theres flowers on the side of the road.    Oh keep yer shirt on,Im sure theres one coming."
381554,Lunatic,2009-09-10 00:47:00,536,"most cars and trucks do not come with ashtrays these days, so theres your answer.  they try to discourage smoking and do not equip cars with ashtrays,then people complain when they get tossed out the window.  i do not smoke. i quit 2 years ago. most non smokers treat smokers as if they were hitler."
381557,SBCregal,2009-09-10 00:51:00,688,my car didnt come with a pepsi can disposal device and i manage not to toss cans out the window when i'm done.
381561,Greencoachdog,2009-09-10 00:53:00,8163,  Pray to your little John Wayne shrine that you never start again eh!???
381569,Lunatic,2009-09-10 01:01:00,536,"no,but when you have filled up that can with cigarette butts and toss it in the garbage you've just pissed off the hippies who want to know why you havent cleaned the can out and recycled it!"
381589,SBCregal,2009-09-10 01:18:00,688,"wouldnt wanna piss off a hippy, better just toss it on the ground"
381590,TC1OZ,2009-09-10 01:18:00,987,What would the homeless smoke if everyone were greedy like you guys?
381594,Daplumma,2009-09-10 01:23:00,1961,"I've been on both sides of the smoking deal also.You can squeeze the cherry off and toss the filter in your trash if you have to.The paper and tobacco will turn to dirt right quick.As GCD says ,the fiters make good mulch,they take forever to break down.Congrats on your quitting,its not and easy thing.I dont have a problem with smokers...just people that litter.Sort of like how hunters feel about poachers.I hate it when the papers refer to criminals that poach as ""hunters"". Joe"
381924,CLofchik,2009-09-10 22:03:00,854,Think of the birds!  All the sad lower income baby chicks that would be homeless without subsidizing from the tobacco industry!  
382043,Joey,2009-09-11 01:48:00,9122,"You should have gotten out and picked it up, they make great bait for catfish doncha know  Joey"
382055,Greencoachdog,2009-09-11 02:00:00,8163,  BWAHAHAHA!!!
382103,bigugli,2009-09-11 04:00:00,6138,I've seen more than one roadside brush fire attributed to cig butts tossed out the window. A very bad practice up north.
382120,johndox,2009-09-11 11:29:00,54,When I complained once about someone throwing their butts in the water they said they make good tampons for female fish.
382237,aplumma,2009-09-11 19:32:00,6896,"  Joey...Joey....Joey... you poor misguided fisherwomen. You all need to come to the South and get a catfishin lesson. I am getting ready to go out Saturday and the first stop is to get about 1/2 dozen or so of 12"" shad to cut in half and send down to the bottom for the real catfish. If my small mind doesn't forget the camera I will post a report.  gheez cigarette butts for catfish......not even sheephead eat them things......   Art"
382278,Joey,2009-09-11 21:29:00,9122, I await your report.  And I'm pretty sure sheephead eat anything

382486,Jonny,2009-09-12 16:32:00,1380, What a great zinger!  I guess the thing that bugs me the most is Tim Horton's coffee cups.
382500,POLLIWOGG,2009-09-12 18:24:00,835,"Its all in how you look at it..I pointed out to a charter cap'n that when he puts 40 kilo of salt on the boat ramp he pollutes 40,000 L of water and risks getting the ramps closed and a $200,000 fine and they said it was pee in a bucket.  I'm sure some look at it as one more butt is just one in thousands."
