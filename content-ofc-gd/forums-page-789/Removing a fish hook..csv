379332,Greencoachdog,2009-09-03 02:42:00,8163, That's my preferred method too Bossman!... I have to wait 'til I get home for the alcohol... but I make up for lost time when I get there!  Pushing a hook thru and cutting off the barb is the least invasive and gives the puncture wound 2 holes to drain from!  ... but damn do I ever cuss when I have to do that!!!
379345,Dutch,2009-09-03 03:13:00,831,"Mercer was here in Peterborough a few weeks back and did some time on the water with a local CHEX reporter.  Well, somehow she got hooked in the lower leg and Dave used this method to get the hook out, showed it on the 6 o√ßlock news.  As said earlier in the thread, this is an accepted mehod of removing a hook that's in past the barb.  Luckily, I've never had to use it.  In the video they should have removed the spoon before doing it.  Glad it wasn't me."
379349,Crazyhook,2009-09-03 03:33:00,1154,I was lucky the hook went right through.. I won't lie there was a half dozen shots of Jager before I went to bed that night  here is the link  
379360,TJQ,2009-09-03 04:12:00,7806, OMG  DUDE....  that was hard to watch!!!!
379368,ciceri,2009-09-03 06:23:00,535," your telling me, seeing the fish thrash while the hook was in him made me cringe and grind my teeth."
379395,Crazyhook,2009-09-03 12:02:00,1154,TJ anything for some good footage  sucked bigtime...
379417,bubbles,2009-09-03 13:39:00,591,"2 Stories  1 - When it happened to me it was in there deep, tried pulling it out (did't want to stop fishing, we were in a tournament, I know you understand) and my buddy almost puked just watching me, no go.  To the hospital I go, they basically did the same thing just replace the line with a pair of shiny pliers!  2 - eyeware - At a train in camp, so a million miles from anywhere and my brother's spoon bounced off his glasses and stuck in his face!  A quick yank and it was out.  Never been on a boat without glasses since.  Kinda makes me feel sorry for the fish"
379479,bigbuck,2009-09-03 15:58:00,2449,"That'll leave a mark!!! I know about that way of doing it but I've never seen it done before. I have personally seen the 'wall of shame' in Kenora General Hospital, there are some nice lures on there missing hooks. I guess that's another reason to pinch down your barbs."
379543,justin elia,2009-09-03 19:53:00,151,Friend took one it the finger this summer in the Soo.  Pic on link.  http://www.wfn.tv/blog/Justin/2990/

379696,chinookhunter,2009-09-04 01:02:00,68,just push the point through youre skin and cut the barb off it pulls out no problem.
379739,Greencoachdog,2009-09-04 03:01:00,8163,"  Yeah, like this.      "
379888,Dara,2009-09-04 17:53:00,3052,  there ya go...you got it now
379913,tinbanger,2009-09-04 19:04:00,1028,"Matts ( Pikeie) last fish at LOW gave him a nice going away present , a hook in the finger with fish attached . Luckily it was a smallmouth with we quickly released , cut of the split ring and the remianing two barbs.  Once back at the lodge his fellow employess gathered for moral support   !!  We use the same method ( first time tried) . 85 lb power pro wrapped arond the hook shank and a set of pliers a  quick yank and ........ what happend ? I  was staring at the power pro thinking it had snapped , matt was looking at his finger wondering where the hook went LOL.  Wish I had video taped it but was supecting a more grusome outcome .  never did find the hook!  tb"
379970,Dozer,2009-09-04 22:42:00,896,"That looks like it hurt with that muskie, I twitched!  haha...  I was fortunate enough ( when I got hooked by user efka, lol ) to have the hook go in past the barb but not deep.  It was yanked out...  As the story goes, I supposedly turned white, my balance was off because I looked like I was going to faint, but hey, just another fish story  I would not yank a deep hook outta my skin like our Ski-yaker or our other friend Makers Mark... I would personally do what GCD did."
382179,fish-miester,2009-09-11 14:13:00,864,"that was me last night flippin jigs, and some how i ended up with my Punisher jig's Huge Owner hook through my middle finger! at first i was like where is my jig? and why do i have this huge birds nest.. and then i realised.. lets just say i was not a happy camper.. + the sun was just going down, but i didnt exactly want to rip it out .. so what i did was took my fillet knife, cut a little slit in the skin then removed it how it says to... as i really didnt wanna ruin my new punisher jig that i bought yesterday.. haha i just wish i had pictures"
379137,TJQ,2009-09-02 17:00:00,7806,I knew it!!  Don't know if anyone's seen this before.  
379140,Dara,2009-09-02 17:04:00,3052,Thats a good way to screw up your hand for ever.
379142,TJQ,2009-09-02 17:06:00,7806,I dunno.. its the recommended method from the American Academy of family Physicians  http://www.aafp.org/afp/20010601/2231.html
379145,mudddtoy,2009-09-02 17:13:00,10,"removed a few hooks just like that, seen it done in the simcoe hospital 20 years ago"

379150,LeXXington,2009-09-02 17:17:00,1928, Don't know read the entire document and I did not see anything about the wiskey but I am sure its in there somewhere

379161,Nemo,2009-09-02 17:38:00,727,Peice of cake should be putting some of that whisky on the entry wound to disinfect.  Bottoms Up....LOL
379164,NAW,2009-09-02 17:42:00,4022,That was posted a few months back.  I only remember that because it was the first post I read on this forum.  It still makes me cringe to see is a second time!
379170,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-02 17:57:00,1022,"Thanks for the link, I think I'm going to print it and laminate it to keep in the boat. One time me and a buddy went fishing and within the first 100m into the troll he caught an eye and caught his thumb in the barb from the fish thrashing around. That was the shortest fishing outing ever."
379173,ecmilley,2009-09-02 18:08:00,2163,"ouch whisky is steps 1,2  4,5,6,7,8 and 9"
379178,ciceri,2009-09-02 18:34:00,535," I had that happen with a largemouth bass.. This video was posted in my thread when I got my hook in the thumb. I tried pulling mine out myself, there was no way, it bloody well hurt man.  "
379183,otter649,2009-09-02 19:04:00,118,The hospital in Kenora on Lake of The Woods has a bulletin board covered with lures & hooks etc taken from patients who unfortuately hooked themselves and needed medical attention to get the hooks out.........
379191,Mike the Pike,2009-09-02 19:22:00,3421,Ouch that was so hard to watch but thanks for posting that TJ.  I have another rule in my boat every fisherman must wear some form of eyewhere because there is no second chance when it comes to your eyes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
379214,Dara,2009-09-02 20:47:00,3052,  I was fishing with my daughter and her friend a couple years ago. Her friend was fighting a salmon boatside and the Jplug came out. Right between their 2 heads. A very narrow miss.
379215,Dara,2009-09-02 20:50:00,3052,  Ok then...I'll do it...I just wandered about tendon damage. I would be more apt to cut the hook and wrap it up.  I did pull one out of my thumb a few years ago...wasn't fun
379221,bigugli,2009-09-02 21:01:00,6138,I've pushed a few through to get them off.  I've had the Doc cut one out.

379261,okumasheffield,2009-09-02 22:27:00,318,I had it like that last week but was lucky enough to be able to push the hook in a bit further and then push the shank downward in a way that I was able to pull the barb out in the directio opposite to how the hook went in.  Let me tell ya ... it was not fun
379263,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-02 22:38:00,0,Perfect. LETS FISH!!!!
379268,acmarou,2009-09-02 22:58:00,63,"I guess it depends how far you are from a real doc. Ain't nooooway I'd let someone that don't have a degree rip a piece of metal out of any part of me with a barb on the other end. Push it through, cut it, and were done. What does the Canadian Medical Association have to say about this? Someone said earlier about wrapping it and seeking medical attention. I AGREE!! Depending on how deep that sucker is imbedded, you could do severe damage man!!  Not sure if you meant it as a joke, but it's not funny!!!"
379275,Greencoachdog,2009-09-02 23:23:00,8163,I can never wait to get back to the house where the whiskey is to get the hook out of me!!! I gotta get that thing out ASAP!!!  ... Cigarettes and lots of cussin' are my only comforters when removing a fish hook from my body!
379281,acmarou,2009-09-02 23:50:00,63,Dog!!! You are the Man! When it comes to Dr Jack & Dr Jim B. You and they I trust. The rest can bite me.  And I think there is room for another!!!  :lol:  I'm goin'g bass fishing for a week. We'll talk later.
379320,TJQ,2009-09-03 01:59:00,7806,"""Ok then...I'll do it...I just wandered about tendon damage.""  Actually they cover all three methods, when I got mine in bad.. we cut it off and pushed it through.. LOL  My wife... and this is the gods honest truth.. told Jaden to go get the first aid kit... she came back with the bottle of scotch.. lol.. it hurt .. but that was funny right there....  we clipped the hook and pushed it through, doused the finger (and my liver) witnh the rest of the bottle, and I swear, the next morning you could barely tell anything happened..."
