I won't even read it when you do.        Ok that was a bluff. Do you have a teaser at least?  It's going to kill me isn't it?

381902,solopaddler,2009-09-10 20:21:00,8605,"Seriously though I'm already marking off the days on the callendar for a return next spring. I've fished all over N/W ON and guided at Kesagami and this river tops anything I've fished for pike.  Still waiting on some video clips and photos from one of the boys, I should have something posted next week."
