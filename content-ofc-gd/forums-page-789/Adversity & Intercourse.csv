381783,JohnF,2009-09-10 13:46:00,3494,"Ain't the 'net grand? Prior to it's introduction many of us who hang out here had only lawn cutting and snow shovelling for entertainment (with an occasional foray to the rivers & lakes) and social interaction was what we did at work. Now we can all clean up after dinner, pour a long drink and settle down at the computer for an evening of intercourse and edification, spiced with fish porn.  Some folks just never quite get the hang of it though. They see the anonymity of the keyboard as an opportunity to blow off steam in a way they probably wouldn't even consider face to face. There's undoubtedly some therapeutic value in that. It's better to let off the pressure than keep it bottled up. Unfortunately it's a pretty selfish way of dealing with one's personal issues. I've had occasion in the past to meet face to face with a few of the pot stirrers from other groups I've frequented and it was interesting to note how unimposing they were in real life. It was obvious the internet allowed them to act out a role they never could in person.  The end result of this anonymous posturing by some is that all of us who avail ourselves of the pleasures of the 'net, and OFC specifically, must accept the bad with the good. But it's really a small price to pay though, isn't it? It's easy enuf to ignore the threads that offend, except that who can really avert their eyes when they see a train wreck about to happen. It's human nature to take a peek. And once you've peeked, it's hard not to get involved, whether as a good samaritan or to throw fuel on the flames?  Personally, I see these threads as a sign that the group is alive and well and functioning normally. If there wasn't a little spice too many would lose interest and drift away and that would lead to a dormant group, then a dead group.  But I hope no one takes that as approbation for their need to stir the pot. Trolling is best done behind a boat as HTHM said. Dissension arises of it's own accord easily enuf (marshmallows and flossing) that it needs no help from the cheap seats. The stirrers really need to understand that there are far better, and more flameproofed, sites to visit where this flaming stuff is a way of life, and most of the folks who stir things up here would be eaten alive on a few sites I've hung out on in the past. The problem with those sites is that inevitably the constant squabbling and insulting finally chases away all  but the hardest core flamers and the site dies from lack of purpose.  So, to the mods and contributing members, thanks for the entertainment. Yer doing a great job.  To the stirrers of the pot, temper yer enthusiasm for shaking it up. There's a fine line between entertainment and trouble. This is too good a resource (for entertainment and edification) to be destroyed by a few slightly warped personalities. It'll outlive most of them anyway. The more immediate concern is that the dissension might drive away otherwise good contributing members who are uncomfortable with the squabbling.  So think twice before you lob those fiery salvoes, folks. Ya never know what the collateral damage might be.  Peace y'all. JF"

381790,TJQ,2009-09-10 14:02:00,7806, LOL....  Thanks.
381803,charlesn,2009-09-10 14:40:00,551," John,  Be careful, I tried this once and my computer caught something even pc-penicillin couldn't fix...  I picked up a new prop (Fury 26) and it was like I'm driving a totally new boat.  Airs out better and added 5 mph to my top end and hole shot is awesome too.  Got 71.0 with two people, full tank of gas and full load of gear.  Can still practically take my hands off the wheel wide open, no chine walk to speak of.  Let's pick a calm day and hit Erie soon.  Let me know.  Charles"
381804,[emailÂ protected],2009-09-10 14:41:00,290,This is the most confusing thread ever...  I feel let down...
381817,Jds63,2009-09-10 15:08:00,1365,Praise the Lord and pass the amo !!!!  well said  JohnF!!!
381848,JohnF,2009-09-10 17:24:00,3494, Your call. The move is behind us now and I'm ready for some R&R. Generally I can get away with a call the night before.  JF
381930,splashhopper,2009-09-10 22:17:00,2931,well said John
381992,HTHM,2009-09-11 00:18:00,4082,"As can I, hint, hint. We still have to spook the grand, eh."
382028,Greencoachdog,2009-09-11 01:21:00,8163,"The term is ""Social Intercourse"" John!... or maybe that's old school.  This thread may or may not pertain to me.  You mention anonymity, that is not me! I've posted many pics of myself on this board and have me many OFNers! The anonymous are the ones that never show themselves in pics, avatars, or the meeting of fellow board members!  You mention ""pot stirring""... I'm not sure I know what that means, do you have a Websters definition for that?  Yes, I may pick at some people on here... but that may mean a few things. It may mean I like you and you're worthy of being noticed  , or it may mean I've noticed that you're easily aggitated (I like that too... hard to pass up an easy mark!!!)... or it may mean I think you're talking too much trash and you need to ""put up or shut up""!  If I haven't said anything to/ignored you, it means I may not care for you or haven't noticed you yet.  A little insight to my background may help some of the newer people understand me a little better. I've worked commercial/heavy/industrial construction all my life, back breaking work under some of the toughest ambient conditions (blazing sun, knee deep mud, and freezing cold). We (the crew) pick at each other all day every day to make the time pass by more quickly and to help us forget a little about the hard work and tough conditions. Were a raunchy/ill mannered/politically incorrect... but lovable bunch!  The absolute worst thing you can do is let a construction worker know when something they said bothers/irritates you... they'll run it into the ground!!!  This site, with it's rules and censorship is kind of like a Sunday School compared to a construction site... and... sometimes I may go a little to far for some folks here.. but 99 out of 100 time I mean no harm!  ... I just forget that not everyone is a construction worker and may have tender feelings and very thin skin!  There's a lot of great people on this site... and that's what keeps me coming back everyday!!!  Oh yeah... there's fish porn here too!!!"
382029,danbouck,2009-09-11 01:23:00,4380,I must say I'm disappointed with what this is actually about.
382031,Daplumma,2009-09-11 01:31:00,1961,"I will vouch for the dawg,hes as nice of a guy as you will meet in person.Very thoughtful and polite,believe it or not.There are more than a few here who have met him and will say the same.Good post John,just some growing pains around here lately. Joe"
382033,holdfast,2009-09-11 01:36:00,1813,"Kind of like the Military, oil field worker, On a rig is so military like its unbeliveable.  Work Hard, Play Hard used to be our motto.  But there is truth what John says.  Most people would not be the same outside the keyboard.  Like giving the guy the finger with your window closed and you driving in the Opposite direction."
382039,Daplumma,2009-09-11 01:45:00,1961,"This is not all about your buddies dying face down in the mud in Vietnam!!!OOOOPs,wrong movie,I thought this was The Big Lebowski."
382058,JohnF,2009-09-11 02:10:00,3494," I only got to work road construction for one summer, and pouring concrete for a summer. I thought the spare gang I worked on the railroad the next summer was tougher than either of them. As for closing ranks I thought the guys in the meat packing plant (two summers) were the toughest of them all.  In any case I hadn't even thought of you when I started this thread. You're an institution here."
382059,HTHM,2009-09-11 02:10:00,4082,"You're from 'bama, you ain't never seen freezing cold.   Oh, wait you did post pics of snow on your yard last winter, so maybe I am wrong. If you want to see freezing cold, come on up to the quinte GTG in November. Mind you, I'll introduce you to some antifreeze that'll cure ya of any feeling at all...So how about it Glen ya comin?"
382063,Greencoachdog,2009-09-11 02:15:00,8163,"  Been there done that back in '07, caught the mycoplasma pnuemonia and no Wall-ice for my efforts... can't say that it wasn't fun though!"
382113,solopaddler,2009-09-11 09:29:00,8605,"Something so well written deserves a response, thanks John."
382574,Jonny,2009-09-13 02:10:00,1380," That sounds a lot like a mine or a smelter or road construction --- all jobs that I have worked. There's a certain code that goes with working for a common cause and getting to know other guys well. It just wouldn't be the same without some good-natured ribbing.  Actually you can find the same code at work in a fishing boat or a hunting camp and even, believe it or not, when a group of guys that are teachers get together for some R&R (i.e. in the aforementioned boats or camps --- in Northern Ontario anyway).  Yeah, Alabama can get cold. I spent a Christmas Eve in Atlanta once with snow on the ground --- never expected that!"
382592,snag,2009-09-13 03:11:00,1932,"True enough,  Years ago I posted a reply to Misfish that I regret to this day.  Misfish was gracious. Raf was gracious. CCMT was gracious.  I was ""schooled"" in internet etiquette.   I carry that lesson now and forever.  (o.k. sometimes I relapse!   )"
