Using your ""climate depot"" website which links out to ""whats up with that"" website for references...you believe the ice sheet is growing? By area or volume...or both? Was this a one year trend or has it been happening for a decade? How do you explain that the polar ice sheet didn't connect to any land in the summer of 2008, and was actually one giant iceberg? How do you explain the northwest passage being open two years consecutively...which hasn't happened in recorded history? How could this happen when the trend is one of growth for the ice sheet?   Don't see much growth happening here."

382307,StoneFly,2009-09-11 23:02:00,574,"So in Southern Ontario, I think summer breaks down like this for 2009,  May: Warmer thank normal June: Average July:  Cooler and wetter than normal, especially daytime time temps August:  Average to cooler and much wetter than normal, except the second half of August got a heat wave and alot of rain. September:  Warmer and much drier than normal.  Day time temps thus far and in the forecast are    higher than July, this has happened a few times in the last 10 years.  We have a High P Zone right now sheilding low temps and rain, ...  Does it suggest global warming,..absolutely not,..but its only 4 months.  How many times have we had +10C temps in January in the last 15 years?  I recall quite a few, this is where the old guys might come in handy. Previous to that it was unheard of.  It is a fact that we get extremes in months that we havent experienced much over the last few centuries,..that is why so many records get broken.  Stop thinking about Global warming locally,..think Climate change!!!  Warming is definately occuring in the arctic, but in southern Ontario, its a little more complicated as well as many other areas of the world.  Imagine Frost in mid june in southern Ontario....it will happen!!!  the heat units this year for farmers were scary until mid august hit, which is typically when heat gets less,...this year it actually saved the corn crop!!!!  Now if that Dam High Pressure zone doesnt get lost soon,..Im gonna borrow Holdfasts rocket luancher and seed the damn clouds myself,..lol"
382322,hotrod,2009-09-11 23:59:00,103,"scuro, the ice sheet may be contracting at the north pole but is growing at the south pole. There is lots of evidence showing we have been on a 10 year cooling phase, how about talking 'bout that? Even doomsdayers are having trouble sticking to the global warming myth.  Global warming takes a break  Imagine if Pope Benedict gave a speech saying the Catholic Church has had it wrong all these centuries; there is no reason priests shouldn't marry. That might generate the odd headline, no?  Or if Don Cherry claimed suddenly to like European hockey players who wear visors and float around the ice never body-checking opponents.  When a leading proponent for one point of view suddenly starts batting for the other side, it's usually newsworthy.  So why was a speech last week by Mojib Latif of Germany's Leibniz Institute not given more prominence?  Prof. Latif is one of the leading climate modellers in the world. He is the recipient of several international climate-study prizes and a lead author for the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He has contributed significantly to the IPCC's last two five-year reports that have stated unequivocally that man-made greenhouse emissions are causing the planet to warm dangerously.  Yet last week in Geneva, at the UN's World Climate Conference -- an annual gathering of the so-called ""scientific consensus"" on man-made climate change -- Prof. Latif conceded the Earth has not warmed for nearly a decade and that we are likely entering ""one or even two decades during which temperatures cool.""  The entire article is here  http://www.nationalpost.com/todays-paper/s...html?id=1982899  I can't wait to get out on the lake tomorrow with my 225!"
382427,scuro2,2009-09-12 05:30:00,904," We see here that July indeed was cool in the NE but overall globally, it was the second warmest July on record. But I'm a skeptic at heart and regional and yearly variation don't mean much to me. I'm looking for unique events such as when the north pole became one huge iceberg in 2008 as it did when it melted around the edges. That happened for the first time in possibly 125,000 years, just before the last ice age. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10...-ice-melts.html Could this be part of natural variance? Possibly, I'm sure others could speak with greater understanding on that issue.  Now, you believe that there is some sort of counter balancing going on here. That while the ice sheets have decreased rapidly at the north pole, they are increasing rapidly at the south pole. But that doesn't seem to be the case. http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summa...86-33695472_ITM I'm open to hearing new ideas and perspectives about what has happened to date at the north pole. What I don't like are bombastic publications and news sources that don't even try to hide their bias. The National Post makes it sound like there was an earth shattering defection, that shows the theory is ""debunked"". Take a look at the tone of another paper reporting on the same issue. Dr. Latif is simply stating that climate change will not be linear or parabolic, but rather there will be oscillation and that the variance can happen over decades.  ""Dr Mojib Latif, one of the world's top climate modellers, believes predictions of imminent global warming may be wrong and that the Earth could be heading for up to 20 years of cooler temperatures. However, the dip will be temporarily - and the long term trend is still for a warmer planet, he says"". http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/art...t-predicts.html"
382441,hotrod,2009-09-12 10:53:00,103,"Scuro, my skepticism comes from they hysterical rantings of people like Al gore and Ban Ki Moon and their ilk. I also feel the science has been hijacked to suit ideologies and accessing funding. I also don't believe ""facts"" that are based on computer models that are merely flawed predictions and can be made to show what the modeller wants, you know the gigo theory. We're on a cooling trend right now, yet it's reported by the majority of the msm that the planet is still heating up! The thing that really concerns me is the idea of cap and trade based on inconclusive science such as it is now, not really knowing the effect that humans have to influence the climate if any at all. To me it is nothing but a scam dreamed up to line the pockets of the elite.  I think it's safe to say that the science is far from settled and there's alot we don't know. It's good that we can debate our differing points of view on a forum such as this without it degenerating into personal attacks.  I'm going fishing and this is my last post on the subject, our clubby is tomorrow and I'm 1 point behind for AOY so I need to find some fish!"
382491,scuro2,2009-09-12 16:58:00,904,"Good luck on the fishing today.  My skepticism on global warming would be based on data, and not the proponents or skeptics involved in the debate...and their possible motives. Carbon in the atmosphere is rising, as are surface temperatures. In reality a large majority of scientists support the theory of global warming, no matter how some want to paint this as a titanic battle between equal and opposing sides. But as they say, the proof is in the pudding. Contrary to your opinion, surface temperatures have been been rising over the decade. Below you will find a graphic NASA video showing global warming over the planet, over the last 100 years.   But, again a few years of unusual weather doesn't mean much. So even if temperatures had cooled that wouldn't ""debunk"" the theory. This is exactly what Dr. Latif had pointed out, and had been mistakenly misinterpreted by the NP as a ""debunking"" by a ""former"" proponent of global warming.  The theory believes that global warming is to intensify as more carbon gets put into the atmosphere. Unique events and highly significant statistical variations will happen. Over time the pattern would be that things will get worse. The shrinkage of the northern ice sheet stands out as an anomaly. Is this anomaly concrete proof? Nope. But it is the most visible piece of evidence in a larger body of evidence. How else to explain what has happened to date? Your ""counter balance"" theory doesn't seem to hold water. But please, my skeptial nature is always open to the counter argument."
381703,Cookslav,2009-09-10 03:58:00,1457," Crap I forgot about him... No need to worry about climates at all if he's right...we have 3 years  Hey kidding aside, I'm all for conservation, and keeping things clean...that started from childhood. Momma taught me not to be wasteful,  keep my room clean, and not litter. Those lessons are important on a day to day level, not just a long term doomsday projection. but in truth ""if"" this climate change event is occurring at a faster rate due to us pesky humans I pose this question to you science folk. Is it better to figure out how to slow it down, and focus on that, or are we better off excepting the inevitability that its going to change naturally regardless. Are we better off buying time, or focusing on how to adapt. Put that in your peace pipe to ponder for a while.  If the climates ""normal, and natural "" change happens over 100 years, and we increase that to 50 years are our efforts better spent learning to adapt, or to buy time? I'd say its a bit of both... But who's studying the adaptation portion?...no one cause fear sells papers and fills news casts.  I'm going to go back to wearing my tinfoil hat now and I'm going to try to figure out what the next big theory will be 10 years from now? Any takers?

381709,scuro2,2009-09-10 04:39:00,904," I'd be a about 50 and I'm not a ""denier"". So far on this very lengthy thread, I've only seen one plausible theory to account for the highly significant changes happening with northern ice pack and that theory wasn't referenced when requested. The north pole was an ice island last year. None of the ice attached to land. Speaking of cycles, the northern passages were never free of ice during recorded history, and that goes back around 500 years. Predictions are that the northern ice sheet will completely melt during the summer in a generation or less. That hasn't happened in at least 125,000 years. Can someone give an alternative explanation to what is going on here? It's been three threads over three years and it's surprising that virtually no one has an opinion on why this is happening."

Their is a mountain of evidence and we have all lived long enough to see it. Some of the possible fixes are as bad as the disease...damming rivers and flooding vallies for example to create hydroelectric power. Hopefully the fuel cell technology catches on. Imagine having a device on your boat that seperates the hydrogen from the water uses it as fuel then returns only water vapour as an exhaust. Of course we may lower the lake levels doing that"

To state this is led by younger people is not the case.  How  can one explain the ""ACCELERATED"" rate of decline within the last 100 or so years, or if you wish---the industrial revolution.  Look at ""Troutologist""---he is that close to the fire he can touch it----Is he not to believe what he see's with his own eyes?  How about some of the interviews with the Inuit that cannot figure what has happened or how they will deal with it.  Ask yourself why species of squid that have always stayed in southern climes are now being caught off the BC coast.  This is not just a North American issue----leading experts worldwide agree this is happening---one cannot say they all have the same financially driven motives.  Now to run around with the sky falling call is also non-productive----it achieves nothing---every journey starts with a single step and as I stated prior--I do what I can--when I can---there will always be more, but I take solice in the fact that I at least try.

381839,Bob,2009-09-10 16:21:00,370,"During Roman times, it was warmer than today and civilisation advanced remarkably.  The Roman legions were using mountain passes that have since been glaciated for a thousand years or so. Seems that one of those recently retreating glaciers has uncovered the ruins of a Roman villa. The so-called dark ages were cold and folks didn't move around much to learn new stuff so civilisation declined.  A thousand years ago, the Vikings settled and farmed on Greenland and for several hundred years, all was hunky-dory but then the little ice age hit and they died off or moved out.  Around the mid 1800s, the world started climbing out of that cold spell and globally gained about one half a degree celsius per century on average.  All these concensus scientists claim the 20th century increased .6 of a degree celsius so does that mean we contributed .1 of a degree celsius to what was already ongoing or did it accelerate that much on it's own?  From 1880 to 1920, there was fear of an ice age that would render Canada uninhabitable in a few decades (according to newspapers of the time).  From 1920 to 1940, the world was warming and the polar bears were doomed.  From 1940 to nearly 1980, it was another ice age and from 1980 runaway warming and the polar bears are once again doomed.  Doesn't matter that there are 5 times as many of them now as there were 50 years ago when they started controlling the hunts.  Seems the polar bears survived warmer periods than today. As I understand it CO2 has been much higher in the past as well. Incidentally, according to info I've read on the subject, polar bears have existed as a separate species for over 100,000 years.  Global warming?  Longer growing seasons?  Larger growing areas?  Lusher plants?  Sounds good to me.  In light of the fact that temps have gone down in the last 10 years to almost equal what they gained in the last 100, I'd be more inclined to fear global cooling myself.  Ho hum!  I'm 64 and I don't give a ratz butt because I'm not going to live into the new ice age.  Flame away!!!"
381842,blarg,2009-09-10 16:50:00,289,"There is no 'proof', there are no 'facts' that prove we are causing any real changes in global temperature or in fact prove that global temperature are really changing at all, on a geologic time scale temperatures vary sometime changing quickly sometimes not, what has happened in the last 50 years proves nothing, NOTHING.  Im all for reducing pollution, including hedging our bets against possible human caused warming, but please, please think before you speak, just because you read it in the star or it was on cbc doesn't make it a fact.  And since some others feel the need to toss out thier credentials i'll just add that i too have an environmental engineering diploma and an env science degree, along with working the last 10 years in weather, particularly in the arctic, I know enough to know that I don't know for sure and if thats the case there is sure as hell no way most anyone else in this thread does either."

381994,scuro2,2009-09-11 00:21:00,904,"Crap? Would that be when people don't even bother answering simple and direct questions?  Over a three year time period, three threads specifically were started to point out the remarkable changes happening with the ice sheet that covers the north pole. The simple question was asked, why is this happening? Yet we have no opinions about this fact, except for one, and unfortunately...that contributor has not responded to requests for references. The rest of the contributors simply don't how to respond. There is nothing on their ""denier"" websites on the melting of the polar ice caps. They can't venture an opinion because to do the topic justice, it's a question of science and statistics and they are in over their heads in this regard. There have been some incredibly illuminating responses on this thread, yet instead of acknowledging the validity of the points made, they retort in the only way they know how.  Stay tuned folks, next September the summer melt will once again be measured and reported in the media.  Will we have a record melt and once again see both northern sea routes open? Or will we see the ice sheet gaining in thickness and area. Either way I'll post, because of all the unusual things that are going on with the climate and our earth, the recent heating trends have been greatly amplified at the polar regions. Nothing like this has happened in anyone's life time, and if predictions come true, and the north pole completely melts over one summer, there will be no way for the ""deniers"" to keep their heads stuck in the sand. Such an event hasn't happened in over 125,000 years or longer. As we speak, scientists are drilling core samples to determine that length of time...perhaps 800,000 years."

It is actually possible to do something about it - luckily the planet is pretty awesome at sorting itself out and given half a chance will regenerate itself pretty handily as long as its not too badly damaged (i.e the existing carbon sinks are damaged beyond repair or outpaced by positive feedback loops)  Oh and regarding past ecological problems, remember the Ozone Layer disappearing? Due to the ban on CFCs and other emission regulations the depletion rate slowed down significantly, and is in fact expected to start regenerating itself sometime in the next 20 years. So we can make a difference!   I don't quite get what you mean here - I try to do what I can (I don't own a car, cycle everywhere, grow as much of my own food as I can etc) but I know for various reasons a lot of people don't have those options at all. For the record, I think Nuclear Power is awesome and I have no idea why the left in Canada is so against it (I blame the Simpsons, lol). I dunno what you mean by cornering me either?  Since you mentioned Acid rain, it was a MAJOR problem back in the day and the situation vastly improved - however recently due to the Oil Sands it has started again, and blowing West into SK, Manitoba and even Northern Ontario, where it is killing all the fish. http://www.ec.gc.ca/acidrain/acidfact.html  It is a major problem because it is also poisoning the water supplies of remote communities in those areas as well as killing the fish"

I have a Bachelor of Environmental Science (Hons) from the Univerisity of Guelph majoring in Earth and Atmosphere Science.  I started 15 years ago (as a mature student), but was already heavy into the journals on the subject.  In my first year, Global warming and Clmiate change was mostly a fringe science, I for one am happy to see the GLOBAL acceptance that has transpired over the years!!!  Whats more is that yes, things happen in cycles geomorphologically and geologically, there have been warm and cold periods.  Just look to the Vikings in Greenland a few hundred years ago.  Notwithstanding this, it is an indisputible fact that greenhouse gases can cause warming.  When we start messing around with this and el nina's and el nino's and slight shifts in temperatures of the oceans and there patterns, and couple this with our knowledge of atmospheric patterns and cycles,...say hello to more and bigger hurricanes, more and bigger tsuenami's (sp?), more earthquakes, more drought, more floods and more tornadoes hitting major popluation centres, more wild fires......  No it doesnt happen over night, like the movies,..but look over a generation or 2 and track C02 (or equivalent) concentration in the atmosphere with global average temperatures, with occurance of natural disasters etc.  Remember that  just because in Ontario we have experienced 2 cold wet summers in a row, doesn't mean the rest of the world has, it doesnt mean even the rest of Canada has.  I could write pages about this, but my school time is finished long ago,..so this is the 10 minute version,..Lol  Sometimes as proud Canadians, we think the world revolves around us, but soooo many people like to be ignorant,...ignorance is bliss.  I love this country and would rather live nowhere else, but we are also the same nation that sold 20 million tonnes of Asbestos to India last year even though we have banned it here and dont even get me started on the toxic waste exports.  Oh and BTW,...before someone calls me a tree hugging, lefty environmentalist, I got into this field, becasue I knew there were better ways to do things, and there was money too be made, and while its been a bit of a Struggle, I WAS RIGHT!!!

381598,alctel,2009-09-10 01:27:00,26,"  The EPA classified Carbon Dioxide as pollution http://www.enn.com/pollution/article/40422 It would have been done years ago but as stated in an above story the Bush administration refused to open the email with the findings, heh.  Here is more info about the acid rain caused by the oil sands - http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix...738&k=66051 Its really really polluting but its so hard to get hard data about since the conservatives refuse to commission a study so its left to provincial governments to do their own ones, and they don't have the resources.  Also I really am not a fan of cap-and-trade either, its a neo-liberal compromise designed to get businesses to go along with reducing their emissions based along the lines of 'the free-market is always right!!' which is a concept I find ridiculous. Its a bit of a crappy compromise that noone likes except big companies who get to make more money off of it"

If you read the link you provided they are trying to make it a pollutant so they can ram cap and trade through so all their buddies can get rich. Just think about it man, every time you breathe you are polluting?????? and what about all the fish in the north that you said are dying??? do you make this up as you go along? what does Bush have to do with it??? sounds like he did something right.   I was thinking the same thing guppy, most(not all.. right Bigfish?) I would guess are the younger generation who have been indoctrinated with the global warming mantra for years now in school, much as I was with the ice age, we're running out of oil and are going to freeze to death crap when I was a kid. I've been through it before and I'm sure there will be something else 20 years down the line that needs to be addressed now or else the world will end."
381627,alctel,2009-09-10 01:53:00,26," The Bush white house asked the EPA some years back to do a report on whether CO2 was a pollutant (this is years after most of the other western governments had done their own studies and found that it was). The EPA did a extensive study, found that it was a majorr factor in climate change and emailed the full report to the white house, who refused to open it because it disagreed with what they wanted to hear.  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/washington/25epa.html is the full story.  Yes CO2 is a natural gas, but we are pumping a TON of it into the atmosphere and overloading the natural carbon sinks that the planet has."

And the Dems only hear what they want also. I've had enough for tonight.  UK's Lord Christopher Monckton, a former science advisor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, claimed House Democrats have refused to allow him to appear alongside former Vice President Al Gore at a high profile global warming hearing on Friday April 24, 2009 at 10am in Washington. Monckton told Climate Depot that the Democrats rescinded his scheduled joint appearance at the House Energy and Commerce hearing on Friday. Monckton said he was informed that he would not be allowed to testify alongside Gore when his plane landed from England Thursday afternoon.  “The House Democrats don't want Gore humiliated, so they slammed the door of the Capitol in my face,” Monckton told Climate Depot in an exclusive interview. “They are cowards.”  The entire article is  here: http://www.climatedepot.com/a/429/Flashbac...ssional-Hearing"

381671,Cudz,2009-09-10 03:02:00,2652,"Well there are valid arguments on both sides.  I know where I stand and yes I agree with some of with regards to climate change.  Climate change is occuring.  At the same time many those same people use words like ""we are the culprits"" or ""humans are the cause"".  There is no arguing that burning fossil fuels as a rule has a negative impact on the environment but..... More than 90% of greenhouse gases are simply water vapour that occurs naturally in the atmosphere.  Our ddition to that amount is not really sustantial.  I will admit that humans do accelerate the process but not as much as the media might want us to believe.   CO2 is always blamed for the 'global warming' phnomenon.  I do not believe this to be the case at all. I once closely monitored an experiment on forest growth and forest harvest.  In this controlled experiment they sprayed 5 acres of woods with 5 times the amount of CO2 than an adjacent 5 acre forest plot.  That nasty CO2 caused the trees to be much larger, stronger and helthier than the adjacent forest trees.  After only 3 years the CO2 forest would be able to produce more than 2 times the amount of wood and product as the non-CO2 plot.  Is CO2 as nasty as we think.  Doubt it.  We just need to point fingers and blame something.  As far as age goes on this discussion, it is natural for youth to believe what they believe.  I see it everyday.  I believe it was Winston Churchill who hit the head on the nail when he said ""Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains."""
381677,troutologist,2009-09-10 03:15:00,951,"Let me pull on the reins there for you. True scientists can have benevolent agendas and there are certain groups that offer self-serving studies (picking the furthest end of the spectrum, worst case scenario). Truth be told you can do a lot with statistics depending on the methods you use and how you interpret the findings.  Here are some things I think about. When else in the history or earth, (the 6000 or 4.5 billion years take your pick) has there been an input of the cocktail of emissions like now? The dinosaurs weren't an industrial bunch by all accounts. Now whether this is causing warming, cooling or what, don't sit there and tell me it is doing nothing to the biosphere as a whole and subsequently causing a trickle down effect to ecosystems and individual species. There literally are infinite ways to observe and study effects of this change.  Im a biologist and did my thesis on causes and measures of long term stress in animals exposed to environmental change. This included polar bears. As I stated earlier in this thread there are real, tangible observations of a change in condition of these animals in 20yrs. This can be directly correlated to rapid environmental change.  Currently I work on a project studying the presence of killer whales in the Canadian Arctic. There are very good records from whaling for over a century regarding killer whales in this area. In many communities there was no verbal history of killer whales. In the last few decades this is a very novel thing to many Inuit. Killer whales cannot persist in the fast ice or solid pack ice as the traditional arctic whales can...they need open water.  My take home message: Something is happening, it can be attributed to human action. Can it really hurt to turn off a light or walk to the corner store? Maybe in your opinion small actions are worth while. I still drive a truck and plan on using oil until something better is offered. Why chance it? Can doing your best (or anything) to reduce your impact hurt? Really I couldn't give a damn if anyone believes in global warming, HOWEVER, the attitude of not being willing to try to lessen your personal impact is ignorant."

381687,troutologist,2009-09-10 03:30:00,951,"They are extremely close. Not sure of the exact number but over 80% (most likely over 90%) homology between their genotypes.  There seemed to be a case of a ""pizzly"" shot by a hunter a few years ago. Had one parent of each species.  Polar bears diverged from grizzly and brown bears around 10 000 yrs ago. Evolutionarily speaking this is very recent."

I believe our contribution is not the primary factor contributing to the climate change.  My opinion is no more valid or correct than anyone other.  It too is a theory, and just that.

That allows them to partake in a means of communication that they are all too good at, and take over the ""conversation"". Fight that urge, and ""kill them"" with kindness instead."
381161,Fishnwire,2009-09-09 10:27:00,983,"  So unless someone can guarantee that they leave absolutely no carbon footprint, they shouldn't even try to minimize the impact that they have? That makes no sense at all.  That's called a ""nirvana fallacy"" and it's a completely backwards (that's the most diplomatic term I can think of) way of thinking.  Just because perfection is not attainable, it doesn't mean that positive steps can't or shouldn't be taken to achieve a better outcome.  It would be like if I pointed out that massive electoral fraud has just taken place in Afghanistan, and then suggested that the Canadian military has been completely ineffective in establishing democracy, and should all be called home tomorrow.

The Tar Sands are awful by the way - they are polluting the crap out of Alberta, Manitoba and SK, while the federal government has waived industrial standards and changed the environmental policy surrounding it. In a time when most countries are starting to move away from oil, it doesn't really make much sense to try to hang on to them, especially since the price of oil dropped so low (Alberta is about to start running a deficit again).

I think most people here are against pollution and destroying the environment but carbon dioxide is necessary for life.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columni...pery-stuff.html  Here's a bit of the article.........   BBC viewers were treated last week to the bizarre spectacle of Mr Ban Ki-moon standing on an Arctic ice-floe making a series of statements so laughable that it was hard to believe such a man can be Secretary-General of the UN. Thanks to global warming, he claimed, ""100 billion tons"" of polar ice are melting each year, so that within 30 years the Arctic could be ""ice-free"". This was supported by a WWF claim that the ice is melting so fast that, by 2100, sea-levels could rise by 1.2 metres (four feet), which would lead to ""floods affecting a quarter of the world"".  Everything about this oft-repeated item was propaganda of the silliest kind. Standing 700 miles from the Pole, as near as the stubbornly present ice would allow his ship to go, Mr Ban seemed unaware that, although some 10 million square kilometres (3.8 million square miles) of sea-ice melts each summer, each September the Arctic starts to freeze again. And the extent of the ice now is 500,000 sq km (190,000 sq m) greater than it was this time last year – which was, in turn, 500,000 sq km more than in September 2007, the lowest point recently recorded (see the Cryosphere Today website). By April, after months of darkness, it will be back up to 14 million sq km (5.4 million sq m) or more"

The cause was identified ( Ohio valley coal burning generators) and remediation introduced ( scrubbers and other changes to nearly eliminate sulphur emissions) and acid rain all but went away. Lakes already destroyed in northern Ontario were treated with lime (or may have been lye..can't recall) and limestone and have all but returned to their former glory. If you lived in Ontario, you saw it. Climate change is real and we are real culprits. Fortunately we also know how to help stop the problem.. provided we are willing to accept our responsibility.

380779,Fishnwire,2009-09-08 13:27:00,983,"As has been pointed out several times...those denying climate change have much, much more at stake than those suggesting that a problem may exist.  Follow the money.  The money Al gore and his bong-water-brigade are making is insignificant to the trillions at stake by various powerful industry interests who want to maintain the status quo.  If a doctor who was employed by the tobacco companies told you smoking is good for you, would you believe him?  Just as the negative health effects of smoking are universally accepted today, so will the science behind man-made climate change be accepted tomorrow.  The idea that some people continued to deny the problem will be laughable.  I find it ironic that the same people who consider the idea of global warming to be nothing more of a ""scare tactic"" are often the same types of people who refuse to believe that the ""war on terror"" is being used as a one.  This notion that attemptuing to address climate change can only result in ""draining what's left of the taxpayer's disposable income"" is wrong.  For example, there are tax breaks available to home owners who make their houses more energy efficient.  You add value to your home, save money heating it, and pay less taxes.  That's all good.  I certainly don't have a lot of answers about what should be done, and I'm guilty of contributing to the problem in my own way.  I burn gas, use plastic, etc, etc, etc.  However, I'm certainly not going to bury my head in the sand and pretend I don't see the problem just so I can sleep better at night, which is the only motivation I can think of that someone would have for agreeing with the oil companies."
380786,alctel,2009-09-08 13:39:00,26," Climate change is a fact. If you look at the data regarding ice melt/average temperature its pretty undeniable, we are even starting to see the effects here in regards to unstable weather patterns. I can't even see why you think it would be a good hoax to play, considering most of the worlds extremely powerful multi-national corporations are fighting tooth and nail against it.  If you can't be bothered to even attempt to look into it and just take the Fraser Institutes word for it that nothing is wrong and its all a HUGE conspiracy between scientists and the worlds governments in order to charge you an extra 1000 bucks a year then don't call the people who are worried about it idiots and fools, just because you don't have the time/inclination to figure out whats correct. The GST needs to go up again anyway, once Harper slashed it by 2% (right before a recession) all Canada's revenue disappeared so now we have Nuclear Plants closing due to maintenance issues, no R&D on practically anything, bridges and roads crumbling, no money for arts and culture and no money for creating jobs.  As for the 'well you will leave a footprint so why bother trying?!' I try extremely hard, I don't even own a car, let alone a boat... obviously that's not practical for a lot of people, you will always leave a footprint, but its possible to scale it vastly down with a small bit of effort, and by your actions (like buying food locally!)  you persuade the big players that its worth doing.     The entire premise of this article seems to be 'but we've had a cold couple of summers!' - it doesn't work like that, climate change is going to involve a lot of places getting locally colder in the summer and warmer in the winter - like Ontario since the Jet Stream is going to be pushed down South. Also the guy who wrote is is a shrill for The Sutherland Institute - again a conglomerate of business interests.   But there is, lowering your own carbon footprint, lobbying for better public transport, supporting politicians who try to make a difference!   It all comes down to us stopping putting so much crap into the air/water , whether its people dying from air pollution, or polar bears/salmon dying because their habitat is rapidly changing."
380801,troutologist,2009-09-08 15:24:00,951,"  You're right polar bears can swim great distances, they are so adept in the water they are classed as a marine mammal. The issue of reduced ice cover is huge for polar bears. Some more reading on polar bear biology will lead you to their fasting regieme during the open water season. Since there is not platform from which they may hunt seals. The bulk of their feeding occurs in spring during the time the seal pups are venerable in dens. The lack of ice has a 2 edged sword for bears. No ice= 1) no way to access seals to eat 2) no ice=no suitable habitat for seals to give brith and raise pups. Thus bad news for bears.  Gough et al. 2004 published a paper on the ice cover trends in Hudson's Bay. To summarize their findings there is approximately 30 less ice in western and southern Hudson's Bay vs. the 1970. This pattern is mirrored across the arctic. What this means is bears need to fast 1 month longer than before. What does this mean to bears? Less fat reserves, as measured by body condition. A state of chronic stress as their body lacks resources for day to day activity. Noteably, thermoregulation, a major issue for a polar bear in summer.  First this effect is observed as individual animals in poorer condition, once these effects are wider spread it becomes a population effect. Observable through reduced reproductive success, thus less bears. If a female polar bear is not in excellent physiological health, the pregnancy does not take effect (Delayed implantation).  This is actual science I have been apart of. The issue at hand is the rate of change of these environmental attributes affecting various species. To persist animals need time (generations) to adapt. If change occurs too rapidly, this is lost. Certain animals are at greater risk due to their niche in the global ecosystem. For example arctic animals have adapted to live in a very particular and narrow set of criteria. Small change has the potential to effect this. The venerable coyote seems to be able to be much more plastic in its adaptability and may learn/change to meet new challenges to survial quicker."
380805,POLLIWOGG,2009-09-08 15:36:00,835,Nice painting Holdfast!  Truth be told the bear would have ate the cub when it didn't have enough ice to hunt on. I can draw you a little stick figure thing ... aw never mind.  But your still a talented painter.
380823,StoneFly,2009-09-08 17:16:00,574," that is a good point!!!  Ice is less dense than water, hence it floats, and your argument holds true for the ice that is below sealevel.  HOWEVER, dont forget about the ice that is not submerged, when that melts, the water levels will go up.  I sure wish the water levels in our southern Ontario rivers would go up soon, Lol.  The little run was a tease!!!"

Please go to a non biased source like the USGS or NOAA I think that was the point of this posting, that so many people and organizations have a political or financial bias that almost nothing can be trusted anymore."
380881,blarg,2009-09-08 19:20:00,289,"You may have heard that the more open water in the arctic the greater the amount of heat will be absorbed and the higher the amount of melting will be, a sort of run away train of melting, and it makes sense, however, it also makes sense that in order to overcome this inertia you would need significantly more cooling, so, not only was it cold enough last year to overcome that problem of more open water, the arctic did more than hold it's ground, it gained ice.  I would be more interested in a global temperature trend over the last couple years more than the 'o but we only have a bit more ice than 2007..', true yes, but it took a significantly colder year to reverse that trend and increase the overall amounts, and THAT might mean something.  Im on the fence about all this, particularly about wether or not humans are causing any changes, for those of you that have bought in to all of this I just hope you understand that all of those phd's doing all of these studies don't know what is happening, they have theories, right or wrong there is no way to know for sure what is or will happen in the future. I just wonder how the average guy can become so convinced of something because suzuki etc said so, the earth has been warmer in the recent past, next time your voting liberal, ask your self if it's because your smarter than those conservative rednecks or just more easily fooled.  Prove that the 'warming' is human caused..you can't, i'd be happy if we reduced pollution, co2, and all the rest, but to wonder what excuses people have in order to avoid the 'truth' shows just how ignorant the op was, and the fisrt paragraph i wrote easily shows why, I wonder why the liberal media doesn't make that point tho....I wonder, o maybe the red star will print a balanced article about it...lol."
380909,alctel,2009-09-08 20:08:00,26," Hey Blarg, the open water theory is just one of several possible positive feedback loops, a more serious one is all the methane that is locked up in permafrost escaping when it melts. The danger is that if we wait a lot longer before doing anything at all, then it may be too late. I can understand people being sceptical, but if you look at the data its pretty clear that something very bad is happening. For example, if you look at the global temperature trend over the last 100 years like you said, you can indeed see it is increasing rapidly.  To everyone that says its just a hoax - who exactly would benefit from it? Governments get pilloried every time they bring it up because it means lifestyle changes and trying to change people habits, which they HATE. Businesses will lose a lot of money since they will be forced to be more efficient and generally its going to be inconvenient for everyone. On the other hand, clearing up the pollution we are making will stop things like the water in SK and Manitoba being decimated by run-offs from the oil fields and poisoning fish and people as well as hopefully stopping climate change.  As for the media comments, I have lived all over the world and Canada has one of the most right-wing media that I've seen(and that includes the US) but then again I guess that's what happens when 2 media conglomerates  between them own 95% of all print media and all of the TV stations in the country (CBC excepted)."

That's not some regional trend or cyclical thing. I've enjoyed a lot of the responses, they have been enlightening. There are a lot of smart people on the board.  It's very hard to prove anything exists. Prove that Schizophrenia exists or that smoking causes cancer. Scientists draw conclusions through a body of evidence. Sometimes the evidence is overwhelming even though one can not conclusively draw a conclusion. Global warming as a theory has wide acceptance in scientific field, even though some would like us to believe that there is active debate here, like two football teams going head to head. That notion is bogus. That's not to say that there isn't a few well known and respected scientists who disagree with the theory, because there are but they are in a clear minority.  As to see ice and trends, it's not just about coverage but thickness.    More here - http://spacefellowship.com/2009/07/08/new-...a-ice-thinning/"
380928,StoneFly,2009-09-08 21:25:00,574," LOL,...Quoting it from A NEWSPAPER was simply to point out that there was a story about methane bubbling up through the pacific ocean in one article and a story about the 'Mystery' of 10 million sockeye dying in the pacific in another article.

380640,alctel,2009-09-08 00:39:00,26," Noone has called anyone names so far? Except one person called me Al Gore   This is correct - ice has a great Volume than the equivalent water volume, but most of the Ice isn't in the sea - its on the land in the Arctic and Antarctic. When it melts enough to fall into the sea, the sea levels rise. You can check this by looking back in history - as the glacial mass increased, the sea level lowered and vice versa."
380645,scuro2,2009-09-08 00:45:00,904,"I don't think you have ""challenged"" anything. There has been a fair bit of mocking. But actually talking issues has not really been attempted, that is unless you believe  the ice in a glass of water jokes were an attempt at discourse. I'd love to see some intelligent debate about recent data and I hope you contribute.  Here's a bit more info to move that discussion along. http://www.seed.slb.com/v2/FAQView.cfm?ID=1166 When the ice cube melts, its volume changes, but its weight is conserved (law of the conservation of mass). So the melted water from the ice cube has exactly the same weight as the water that was displaced by the ice cube when it was frozen -- therefore the volume of melted water fits exactly in the previously displaced volume -- and the water level stays the same.  Note that this argument applies only if the ice cube is made of the same water as the water that it is floating in. This is true, for example, with the Arctic ice pack, which is made of frozen sea water. However, it is not true for Antarctic icebergs, which are blocks of fresh-water ice from the continent that are floating in salt-water sea. In this case, we must take into account that the salt water is denser than the fresh water. The fresh-water iceberg still weighs as much as the weight of the displaced salt water, but because of the difference in density, the volume of melted fresh water will be slightly greater than the displaced volume of salt water -- so when the iceberg melts, the water level will rise, although the difference is very small.  What would cause sea levels to rise significantly would be the melting of ice packs on land. The water flows off the land into the water, adding volume. And one of the biggest chunks of ice would be on Greenland. Recent analysis on that issue here -> http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009...-climate-change"

My brother, who is an amateur meteorologist, introduced me to it. If you take a look at the resume of the person who wrote the article, he is no slouch. http://www.wunderground.com/about/jmasters.asp If you think about it, how could you have an underground weather network? I think the title is all a little tongue in cheek. Jeff Masters is very insightful and brings information to the webpage that one doesn't see elsewhere. For instance that fact that the north pole is actually slowly tilting away from the sun during the summer, and that the ice sheets should be spreading...was news to me. http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMaste...l?entrynum=1310  Your links really don't add anything to the original point. I have no problem accepting that there are scientists who disagree with the viewpoint that there is global warming. But how do you explain the record ice sheet melts at the north pole? I've posted each year, over the last three years on that point. Each of those years were records, or had other highly significant events happening at the north pole. No one really wants to discuss that issue. They want to mock the idea of global warming, or they post stuff that has nothing to do with this particular issue. In the end the thread gets locked because people like yourself try to draw out emotional responses by taunting people. Do you actually have an opinion on the melting of the ice cap?"

Both of these individuals have strong ties to the George C. Marshall Institute which is a front for oil companies and business interests. The majority of those 17,000 signatures were unable to be confirmed since it was just a name, and not even an institution, had a lot of duplicates, and a bunch of people were put on their who didn't agree with what it had to say, and were unable to get their names removed. This is what I meant earlier by lobby groups trying their hardest to cloud the issue.  The general scientific agreement in the natural sciences is that the earth is heating up far far quicker than it should by natural processes.  I agree with you about tackling water pollution, the thing is water pollution, climate change etc are all parts of the same tree - its about reducing the waste we put into the air, the water and the earth - all these things will lead to healthier lives for humans and the animals and fish we hunt, which can only be a good thing. And really - no one has anything to gain by making up a 'climate change myth', people hate taxes generally, and hate being told to change their lifestyles, and every politician that has stuck their neck out about this has got horribly punished. Oil and Gas companies have a lot more to gain by discrediting the whole thing than other people have to gain by promoting it.  We have to get off of fossil fuels at some point soon anyway, so may as well start as soon as possible and get rid of some of that smog as well!

A guy had what I think is a simpler explanation.  Every rain drop and snow flake has to condense on a particle, this particle can be pollen dust or whatever is floating around in the air. In the last couple centuries there has been a lot of suit from burning coal going into the air and with the natural air flow finds its way to the arctic. with snow forming on coal dust we end up with darker snow cover not the blazing white that makes you go blind from reflected sunlight. Not reflecting sunlight creates heat and at some point we reach a threshold point where the snow melts, the melting snow leaves behind all the dust and crap that was in it and this absorbs more sunlight causing the melt to speed up.  If you want to know the sea level after the icecap melts just dig up that old map of Antarctica  without the ice on it or better still checkout where the tree line was on Ellesmere I.  Thousands of people die every year from air pollution but nobody cared so maybe they jacked up the threat of climate change in an effort to save lives, unfortunately in the debate on climate change the people dieing every year have been forgotten."

We've now had two straight years in the Arctic without a new record minimum in sea ice. However, this does not mean that the Arctic sea ice is recovering...  The researchers found that Arctic temperatures steadily declined between 1 A.D. and 1900 A.D., as would be expected due to a 26,000-year cycle in Earth's orbit that brought less summer sunshine to the North Pole. Earth is now about 620,000 miles (1 million km) farther from the Sun in the Arctic summer than it was 2000 years ago.

380457,bassman87,2009-09-07 12:58:00,586,But how will the fishing be?
380458,Roy,2009-09-07 13:07:00,13728,  Quite good! Try the submerged 401 at the Kennedy Rd. exit.
380467,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-07 13:29:00,0,I think the stuff on the north end melted and froze on the south end. So it's the same.
380475,troutologist,2009-09-07 14:43:00,951,"Interesting note on the subject. I was flying surveys over Ellesmere Island in August, we stopped and picked up and observer from the Grise Fiord hunter and trappers association, an older gentlemen who seemed very well versed in the environment surrounding his home. Numerous times he stated ""its all melting""  Could be part of a natural fluctuation, but it seems there has been a large change in this man's lifetime in the arctic."
380495,bucktail,2009-09-07 15:38:00,1857,"I simply can't believe any study any more, last week I watched a report on how this year the arctic sea ice didnt melt since it was so much colder then normal.....and it was!! Either everyone is lying or everyone is incompetant or doing it for political or financial benefit. It ranks up there with bird flu, west nile,SAR and now Swine flu. It would be nice to believe somebody!!"
380498,alctel,2009-09-07 15:55:00,26," It's true, unfortunately.   It is - its currently been rising 1.8 mm per year over the last 100 years and is currently accelerating   The trout and salmon really don't like the changes (as in probably happened in BC this year) but its debatable whether they are dying because of more direct changes to their habitat (development etc) or directly because of climate change   It was colder, but it was still the 3rd highest melt on record (after 2007 and 2008), and still not good. Thats why you are starting to see Canada and other countries arguing over the North West passage, since it will be extremely valuble once its unfrozen for most of the year.  There are a lot of business interests against the idea of global warming and climate change (seriously changing the amount of carbon we are releasing will require either big lifestyle changes, huge expense or both) and they are very good at painting everyone who worries about it as 'Al Gore' or a stoned hippy, and filling the airwaves with trash studies by the Frasier Institute etc till people get so jaded they just stop caring."

380574,Fishnwire,2009-09-07 22:32:00,983,"  That might be going a little far...a sense of humour is usually a good thing.  However, I do find it a little surprising when I encounter people who still think there's not a problem or anything to worry about.  I really have to laugh when others suggest that people trying to raise awareness of climate change are only doing so for their own economic self-interest...but are prepared to believe studies conducted by the oil and gas industry as fact.  C'mon...who has a bigger ecomonic interests?  The internation oil industry, or a bunch of ""hippies"" and Al Gore?"
380577,holdfast,2009-09-07 22:39:00,1813,"There's always the bright side.  More water, less Ice.  Hey we can build a Seaport in Churchill, now you guys can visit the Poor Polar Bears that are drowning, oops I mean swimming from ice sheet to ice sheet.  And lastly, instead of reading about it, maybe you can actually see them for yourselves since you care so much.  In the mean time Ill let you guys worry about it, as I got more important things to dwell on.  Ill just check on whats the next Doomer on the CBC."
380579,holdfast,2009-09-07 22:43:00,1813," That's the thing with pacifists.  If you disagree or challenge them, when backed to a corner, they first revert to name calling, and if that doesn't work, the Human rights or other forms of litigation.  The Red necks, well, just laugh it off. LOL"

380592,chinookhunter,2009-09-07 23:00:00,68,if you know everything than what number am I thinking right now? dont know? not impressed at all it was 5
