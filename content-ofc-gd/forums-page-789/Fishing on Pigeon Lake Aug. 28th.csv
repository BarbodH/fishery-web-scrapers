377798,ehg,2009-08-29 17:55:00,2666,"Hi, haven't done a fishing report since back in March, simply because i haven't fished. Yesterday a surprise opportunity came up, so a fishing we went. Didn't really seem to promising since the winds and weather (and moon phase) were not in sync but i sure was happy to get on the lake anyways. Arrived at destination just before noon so mostly having to fish in mid-day didn't seem right either. Luckily the east winds made our favorite locations calm and wave free so we could throw topwaters for bass all day instead of just early morning or evening.  First cast of day and i missed a big bass could only hope for better. Kept at the topwaters and we nailed lots of bass, they seemed to be on the bite. Caught quite a few smallies this size    Caught some largemouth similar size    Caught a few rock bass and even a perch on these topwaters    Decided to give the topwaters a rest and relax and troll some muskies. After about a half hour of trolling and nearly falling asleep, Dave shouts ""I got one!"". So off goes the engine and the reeling starts. We were trolling over the deepest part of the lake and as a result lots of line was out. After some jumps and thrashing near the boat finally the fish is landed.    The fish wasn't weighed or measured but i guess it was 37-40 inch and kind of chunky.  So we kept trolling for a bit until we passed one of my favorite spots. I thought throwing topwaters at this spot at 4 in the afternoon was cool since we were there anyways. Turned out to be not a bad idea, ended up quickly catching this bass.     Ended up measuring length at 21.75 inches but not weighing but i guess around 6 lbs. What a big chunk of bass it was! Did take a pic for entry in OFC tourney as well.  So instead of a drizzly cool day in Toronto got out for a decent day of fishing not to far away.  Cheers, ehg"
377808,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-08-29 18:29:00,1362,Great report ehg!!....now that's a nice Bass and that Muskie isn't too shabby either!!  I hope you took another pic of that bass with your Team#1 card.......we like to show babies like that to Sinker
377809,lhousesoccer,2009-08-29 18:37:00,442,Been a long time since I've fished Pigeon.  Makes me want to get back to my old stompin' grounds again!  Great pics.
377816,kickingfrog,2009-08-29 19:17:00,8333,That last picture is great. It makes that smallmouth look even bigger than it already is.
377898,msp,2009-08-30 01:54:00,1336,"Wow, huge smallie !!! Sounds like a great day on the water, a real "" mixed bag "" Thanks for the report. Its been years since I have been there........many great memories as a kid."

377936,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-30 03:18:00,0,nice black!
378095,majorlifts,2009-08-30 17:52:00,171,"The interesting thing is all this happened when EHG took control of the boat. I think he has an incredible ability to see the fish and know just where they are. He would do well as a muskie guide, no doubt. Thanks for letting me tag along ehg."
378096,Greencoachdog,2009-08-30 18:03:00,8163,"Excellent report, pics, and fish Erik!!!  Glad to see you got out on the water, and even better to see you had a great day!!!  You can PM me the tourney pic or just post it to our discussion thread in the tourney section!!! Thanks a Bunch for that entry!!!"
378111,Gerritt,2009-08-30 18:36:00,6129,I dunno.... the bicep shot make that Bass look puny!  nice pictorial!!  Thanks!  G
378323,ehg,2009-08-31 02:24:00,2666,"Thanks for replies! This was a last minute trip with no real expectations, so to have fish hitting topwaters all day was a treat. Unfortunately my buddy lost his perch jointed Grandma lure to zebra mussels shortly after that musky, must had been made 20 yrs. ago. That was one of largest smallies of my life. Have caught a couple of others over 6lbs at same spot over last couple of decades. All were caught in last week of August. The picture turned out pretty good of that big smallmouth."
378533,Bly,2009-08-31 19:49:00,1556,"Sometimes, last minute trips are the best.   Great to hear that you were able to get out...nice musky and sweet bass!"
378810,highdrifter,2009-09-01 14:14:00,2534,Way to go brotha!!  You look in good health and in good spirits.  That's an awesome smallie too.  Thanks! HD
378811,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-01 14:20:00,3761,"Nice Musky, and wow Congrads on that big smallmouth bass!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
382602,snag,2009-09-13 03:37:00,1932,Almost missed this one Erik.  You're quite a team.  I was wondering if you tried using the perch shad while trolling?  Waaaaaay better than sitting around the big smoke/smog.  Good on ya!
