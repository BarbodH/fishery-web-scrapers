376043,irishfield,2009-08-25 00:37:00,26272,"Well... I'd be on this like a fat kid on a smartie, but I've been dealt a bad hand this summer. Not enough turn around time for me my friend."
376051,Slop,2009-08-25 00:50:00,151,"Solopaddler,  This is an extremely generous offer and I'd be all over it, even at the last moment but this is only my 2nd post to the community.  I was part of the gang that visited trophy heaven last year with Bunk. Yes, Walleye are plentiful and sometimes large. It's the Pike that you need to be prepared for. Bring lots of Muskie gear.....you lads are gonna need it!!  Hope to see a 50 plus incher upon your return.......safe travel."
377529,solopaddler,2009-08-28 22:35:00,8605,"Both spots are now filled. There's a few people I've left hanging waiting for an answer and for that I'm sorry. Was out of my hands as the last person took a while to commit.  Thanks everyone who showed interest, wish I could accomodate everyone.   Mike"
377584,BillM,2009-08-29 02:09:00,17367,"Don't bust my rod!!!!!!!!!!  :)  Have fun Mikey, I wish I was going with ya bud!"
377588,solopaddler,2009-08-29 02:13:00,8605," Thanks buddy, I'll do my best to wear it out on giant esox."
377684,singingdog,2009-08-29 10:56:00,1047,"Thank god that last spot filled.....now maybe I can get to sleep instead of laying in bed, trying to figure out how to swing the time . I described the trip to my wife and she said ""That's an amazing deal."" That didn't help!"
377744,BillM,2009-08-29 14:18:00,17367,"Bring your memory cards boys, cause they'll be filled by the end of the trip  June 2010 will not come soon enough!"
377761,Skud,2009-08-29 15:32:00,739,"I bought a second, waterproof camera last night. I am going to take both my cameras to be sure I come back with lots of pics."
377773,solopaddler,2009-08-29 16:12:00,8605, Excellent!
377775,Skud,2009-08-29 16:39:00,739,I also picked up the Eagle Cuda 300 Portable fishfinder to help find those stacked up walleye.
379530,Paulus,2009-09-03 18:49:00,522,"Good god!  Who wants to catch that many fish anyway?  You'll get so bored with the unending repetition that having your hands covered in slime every 5 minutes will start getting really annoying. The boat will become extremely confining and if someone starts to develop gastric excesses, sea-sickness will surely follow. All you'll want to do is get back to camp so that you can drink beer or rye & coke, in sufficient quantities to numb the appalling regularity of fish after fish after fish after *yawn* fish. Eating fish again and again and again and again will give you pains, and the very sight of fish will start to become unappealing. Worse, it will become disturbing, gruesome, nauseating. Months later, you'll be in a supermarket and want to retch every time you go through the seafood section, especially if there are live trout swimming around in their greasy aquarium. Accidental glimpses of your goldfish will trigger flashbacks and, at night, they will bring nightmares of being buried alive beneath mounds of wriggling, slimy esox lucius, walleye and emerald shiners. Madness will begin to set in: sewage ditches, the don river and the sahara desert providing the only likely sanctuaries where fish scales might never be smelled. They'll find you in the trunk of your own car, covered in fishing line, whispering hoarsely ""the horror! the horror! Grey Poupon!""  Nope. Not for me!    p.-  p.s. ask Mike about ""Grey Poupon"""
379532,anders,2009-09-03 19:08:00,1168,Yeah....What he said!!!
379553,DRIFTER_016,2009-09-03 20:13:00,10439,  Sounds like the jealous rantings of a non-fishing father of twins!!!!  Here's more salt for your wounds Paul. I'm leaving on Saturday for 5 weeks of trout and salmon slaying in Alaska!!!!  TEEHEEHEE!!!!!
379797,Paulus,2009-09-04 13:15:00,522," Nice  but in all honesty, 5 weeks would be too long for me now. I'd have to have them all with me, the boys and their mama, if I was going fishing that long.  The papoose are going to school, J/K this year - it's too much to miss. I guess that makes me a weekend warrior/urban fisher. It's not so bad: when you get cold, or just bored, there's always a timmies around. Ah! the sweet sounds of the 401!  p.-"
382215,Paulus,2009-09-11 17:58:00,522,"Um... excuse me, but is this where I will find the pics for the trip to see the Ottawa P*ss Cats?  Just wondering...    p.-"
382526,PikeMolester,2009-09-12 22:08:00,428,wheres the report
375347,solopaddler,2009-08-22 22:31:00,8605,"Some of you guys may remember Moosebunks post on the Attawapiskat last year. Numbers of trophy pike and huge walleye to boot.  Earlier this summer I became aquainted with a gentleman who's building a brand new camp on a completely virgin, never before fished stretch of the Attawapiskat located about 80km's upstream from where Bunk fished.  After talking to the man I actually booked a week at the camp next June..  Now here's the kicker. I received a call from him today and he's asked if I want to come up for a week around labour day at a very minimal cost.  I'm flying in with another member, Jason (Basskicker on the board) on Wed Sept 2nd, flying out Tues Sept 8th. The flight is out of Nakina so we're driving up on Sept 1st and grabbing a motel the night before.  The outfitter has asked me if 2 more people may be interested as it would help him offset the cost of the air charter. Just to let you guys know the sole cost to go on this trip is to pay part of the flight cost in. The flight out is taken care of. There is no charge for the use of this brand new camp and all the equipment. To put this in perspective, a trip to the Pym island camp where Bunk went runs $1700 plus tax per person. For this early Sept trip the cost will be $500 each. A once in a lifetime opportunity imo. Jason and I will still be going even if 2 more don't join us and at no extra cost. I'm simply trying to help this guy offset his flight costs as he's been very generous with me.  I'm offering this up to my fellow OFC members publicly because frankly it's my association with OFC that has created this opportunity.  PM me if you're interested or email me directly at [emailÂ protected]"
375358,mistaredone,2009-08-22 23:31:00,913,Wow!  Sounds amazing.
375360,TC1OZ,2009-08-22 23:42:00,987,Already got a trip planned then...sounds like a once in a life time opportunity
375370,Terry,2009-08-23 00:11:00,14456,"wow what an offer if it was one more week away I would jump all over it, but that's the week my job moves to a new location ...dang"

375650,solopaddler,2009-08-23 22:31:00,8605,Thanks guys. I still have one spot open. There's someone that wants to go and is trying to swing it but it's entirely possible I'll still need to round up one more guy. I understand it's tough at such short notice....

375740,fishnsled,2009-08-24 02:52:00,3520,Now if work didn't take away one of my weeks vacation this year I'd be all over this.  At least we were all able to keep getting our pay cheques and no layoffs.   Always take a week in September but that won't be happening this year.  Very kind of you to put this up on the board Mike.  Perhaps another time.
375750,Cudz,2009-08-24 03:02:00,2652,wow.  sounds awesome.  The school board kind of frowns on missing the first few days of the new school year.  Go figure.
375824,Billy - Curtiss,2009-08-24 14:17:00,241,I wish!
