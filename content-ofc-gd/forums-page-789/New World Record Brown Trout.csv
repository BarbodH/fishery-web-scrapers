381726,craigdritchie,2009-09-10 11:06:00,1586,"Wow!  According to the Ludington (Michigan) Daily News, some guy caught a 41 pound, 7 ounce brown in the Manistee River. It's a pending world record.  www.ludingtondailynews.com/news.php?story_id=45793"
381729,Spiel,2009-09-10 11:29:00,9065,What a beast. Hopefully we'll soon see some pictures.
381747,wallacio,2009-09-10 12:19:00,475,"This pic was posted along with the story on another board...though I can't confirm if it is actually the fish in question. (regardless, this one is a monster!)  "
381749,BillM,2009-09-10 12:26:00,17367,Look at the size of that thing!!  lol
381751,laszlo,2009-09-10 12:32:00,487," just slightly larger then the 12"" browns i'm used to catching."
381777,craigdritchie,2009-09-10 13:25:00,1586,This pic is now rotating on the Ludington newspaper website home page  (www.ludingtondailynews.com).  
381779,MJL,2009-09-10 13:32:00,2427,Legend  I'm hoping one day I'll get into a fish that size  I remember reading an article saying that the Seeforellen strain of brown trout (which were stocked in the great lakes) could possibly reach weights of over 50lbs
381781,wallacio,2009-09-10 13:41:00,475," Looks like the same fish...a big hen, worn lower caudal fin."
381785,Musky or Specks,2009-09-10 13:55:00,2710,Let me be the first to say....ATLANTIC!!!! LOL
381832,BrownTown,2009-09-10 16:04:00,103,What a beast!
381837,dobee,2009-09-10 16:17:00,301,"thats things is huge, sucks it has to die though..."
381849,anders,2009-09-10 17:26:00,1168,thats worthy of a record!!!  impressive!!!  isnt it a worn out Chinook...cant be an atlantic...
381850,Leecher,2009-09-10 17:29:00,7832,WOW   MONSTER brown The guy must of had the fight of his life with that beast.... Leechman
381852,solopaddler,2009-09-10 17:40:00,8605,"Amazing, thanks for posting that. What's even more incredible to me is that it was caught in the river. They don't usually start to show up in numbers 'till a bit later. With the warm temps it must have been a battle."
381887,kickingfrog,2009-09-10 20:03:00,8333,"Big deal, he didn't catch it on a fly.   Oh... is that sour grapes?   What a pig.   What do you suppose that guy on the left is doing in that first picture?"
381888,scuro2,2009-09-10 20:07:00,904, He's looking at the lure and realizing the lip is broken and it wasn't running right!!!  :D
381889,johnnyb,2009-09-10 20:09:00,3413,I think he's sick with envy...tossing a few cookies over the side...
381990,Cudz,2009-09-11 00:14:00,2652,He is trying to get the gill net back in the water so nobody sees it.
