381606,Ping,2009-09-10 01:34:00,15,Does anyone have a reccomendation? I was looking to rent a canoe with my girl friend this coming weekend to do some fishing in scugog. We've typically rented boats but $$ start adding up when you go every weekend.  We've never fished from a canoe before so any tips would also be appreciated.  Please help the newbie... =)

Seems like quite a few people have flipped their boats. Considering me and my gf are both fairly new to fishing I think we may just have to pass on the canoe unless anyone has some helpful advise?  last thing I want to do is flip a canoe with my gf in it, wouldn't hear the end of it."
