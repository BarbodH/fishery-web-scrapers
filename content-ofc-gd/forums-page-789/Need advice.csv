I have been a registered member since 2001 under another username and post several times per week.  The reason I have created this thread under a new username is to protect the identity of my step-son.  About a month ago he had a failed suicide attempt and has been in the hospital since. He is in his early 20's. I won't go into details but he has depression issues and has had several setbacks in life over the past year. He is now getting the help he needs.  As his stepdad, we have had a pretty good relationship.  For years, since he was young I have attempted to pass along my passion for fishing but he had little patience for it and never really caught much that would give him the lifelong itch.  In the past 6 months however he has a renewed interest in it. Recently, he has asked that I take him and I am overjoyed to say the least. One day this week he will be spending the day with me. It's another shot at perhaps making a connection with him and hopefully turn things around.  I intend to take him to Port Dalhousie and fish a mile or two out. I have a 14' boat and motor, trolling motor, downrigger, fishfinder and all the tackle needed.  Alternatively I may take him to the whirlpool, gorge or Queenston to fish from shore.  The advice I am looking for is any reports/info you may have as to where and with what we may get him into a good sized fall salmon.  I understand this time of year many are reluctant to give details in a reply. Please feel free to PM.  Thank you in advance to all the members of OFC.  Wish me luck!"
382402,Twocoda,2009-09-12 03:39:00,4130,This is quite the situation you are in ...i wish you luck  i would focus on the tribs and do some shore fishing ...the salmon are in the rivers but if your heart is set on hitting the lake ..stay in shallow cuz the majority of the fish are staging at the mouths...  Good luck to you and better luck to your step son...  brush up on some good jokes to make the kid laugh ...

382450,hooked on it,2009-09-12 13:14:00,2, Thank you again slashhopper for your words of encouragement and offer of assistance.    Unfortunately I don't think time would permit. Curious to know however what you are suggesting.
