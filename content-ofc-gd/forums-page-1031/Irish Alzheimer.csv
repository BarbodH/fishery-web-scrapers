After Mass, the priest caught up with Murphy and said, 'Murphy, I am so glad you decided to come to Mass, what made you come?'  Murphy said, 'I got to be honest with you Father, a while back, I misplaced me hat and I really, really love that hat. I know that McGlynn had a hat just like me hat, and I knew that McGlynn come to church every Sunday. I also knew that McGlynn had to take off his hat during Mass and figured he would leave it in the back of church. So, I was going to leave after communion and steal McGlynn's hat.'  The priest said, 'Well, Murphy, I notice that you didn't steal McGlynn's hat. What changed your mind?'  Murphy said, 'Well, after I heard your sermon on the 10 Commandments, I decided that I didn't need to steal McGlynn's hat.'  The priest gave Murphy a big smile and said; 'After I talked about 'Thou Shalt Not Steal' you decided you would rather do without your hat than Burn in Hell, right ?'  Murphy shook his head and said, 'No, Father, after you talked about 'Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery'  I remembered where I left me hat.'"
