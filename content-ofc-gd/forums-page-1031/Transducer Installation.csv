201570,RangerGuy,2008-05-14 14:13:00,564,So I have to replace my transducer this week before the long weekend. So I figured this is a timely question  After installing the first one as per Lowrances instructions with the line on  the transducer level with the bottom of the boat.  Thing is I get a small rooster tail off of the transducer when running at high speeds. Is this normal or do I have it to deep?
201648,Sinker,2008-05-14 17:00:00,8692,"Mine does that too.....normal I think.  as long as its not above the bottom of the hull, and its far enough away from the engine's turbulance, you should be good to go.  Sinker"
201651,RangerGuy,2008-05-14 17:20:00,564,Cool thanks.. just wasn't sure because I was changing the position a few times with the orginal one trying to get to work good without a roaster tail thinking I had it installed wrong LOL!
201838,pikehunter,2008-05-14 23:39:00,1659,"Mine does the same thing, drives me nuts if I start paying attention to it, so I do my best to ignore it and not look back at higher speeds. A good tail wind and it sprays into the back of the boat.  Hopefully somebody has an easy solution."
201851,purekgw,2008-05-14 23:59:00,585,they will do that because there level with the hull of u boat and its displacing water just like your boat so it would have a small spray
201911,POLLIWOGG,2008-05-15 01:09:00,835,The flat transducers could be siliconed to the hull  to stop that. I just got a new setup and it has a spray shield above the transducer that is a piece of metal that snugs up to the boat and mounts at the 4 bolts.
201914,firefisher,2008-05-15 01:11:00,22,Hey Polliwogg  Where did you pick up the spray shield.  Sounds like a cool setup.  FF
201918,Greencoachdog,2008-05-15 01:18:00,8163,"If you're getting a roostertail off of your transducer it's installed too deep, raise it a little."
201955,POLLIWOGG,2008-05-15 01:52:00,835,"The spray shield came with the transducer because these are different and mount below the hull, it would be easy to make as its just a flat piece bent U shaped at the sides to mount into the 4 bolts. Its an interphase scanning sonar.  I'd try like the Dog says and try to tweek it a bit, on my regular sonar as soon as I'm happy with the position of the transducer something hits it and I'm at it again, right now I loose bottom at 50'."
202142,RangerGuy,2008-05-15 14:53:00,564,Just found an interesting article. Thought I'd share  Transducer Installation  This is where the unit was installed when I purchaced the boat and I installed my 102c  transducer in the same spot just a little lower cause the original unit would loose bottom when running. I'm thinking based on the link above. I should move it over to the right of the step in the hull.  Because when running full out if I don't turn down the sensitive I get a full screen of interernce but still get a good depth reading  
202159,Greencoachdog,2008-05-15 15:17:00,8163,"  That's a good article, and it does look like it needs to move to the right.   I like this statement from the article:"
202410,pikehunter,2008-05-15 23:55:00,1659,"Thanks GCD, mine is installed with the bottom of it just projecting below the hull maybe say an 1/8"" or 3/16"" I have tried tilting it up a little and down a little. Either way it sends a rooster tail up higher than the transom.  BTW, dealer installed when the boat was new."
202415,Greencoachdog,2008-05-16 00:10:00,8163," The 2 main screw holes on the mounting bracket should be slotted so you can adjust the depth of the transducer, there will be one screw you'll have to remove to let the bracket slide up or down. Fill the 3rd screw hole with a good marine grade silicone caulk or epoxy. The 2 screws in the slots will hold it until you get it tweaked out up or down, then when you're happy with it redrill for the 3rd screw.  Tilting the transducer will give you a false depth reading because it won't be shooting down directly under the boat, it'll be shooting at an angle in front of or behind the boat (out towards Aunt Nancy's house somewhere)."

202692,wallyboss,2008-05-16 18:56:00,1095,"I tought that the best place on a fiberglass boat is to mount it inside, the transducer shoots thru the fiberglass."
202731,Billy Bob,2008-05-16 22:16:00,5865,"GUYS, just tilt the transducer a little bit forward. This does two things, stops the rooster tail and forces water over the complete surface of the transducer at high speeds which give you a good reading at any speed.  YES it will shoot the cone angle just a little bit forward but not enough to matter. This installation practice has worked for me for MANY depth finders I have installed for myself and other."
