Walleye weren't open yet There weren't many fresh weeds in the shallows where I was, but I found a few fish around Hurricane Point. Other shallower Kawartha lakes that I visited on the weekend had much more developed weed beds. I'm sure Stoney will soon catch-up, now that the weather has warmed up again. Garry2R's"
201378,TangerineDream,2008-05-14 02:08:00,47,Thanks... Yeah I know muskies are closed but they come naturally when walleye fishing there... Looking forward to walleyes though.... Thanks for the info. Did you get crappies off the point?
201390,kingofthesteelhead,2008-05-14 02:32:00,140,Was up at my trailer on the weekend at littles just across from pine vista. Got up late Saturday morning and got a couple of walleye and ran into a small school of big crappie. My nephew was on the water at first light and had their limit of walleye by 900 am. Went out again Sunday and got one walleye and the wind came up awful. We found a fairly sheltered bay and caught some more big crappies. Will be up there on the long weekend from Friday to Monday. Send me a pm if you like.
