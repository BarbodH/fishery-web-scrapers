201945,Gerritt,2008-05-15 01:42:00,6129,"While I tried my hardest not to comment on this thread... If you had to defend yourself in court  the judges will look at the spirit of the law... meaning what did the law intend to enforce.. not semantics. If the OMNR were to publish the RULES.. vs. the summary, you had all be educated in legalize and have days to through through all of them..  That said.. in court you would lose as the spirit of the law is what will prevail in court...  Hook them in the mouth and put the rest back.. I dont get what is so hard about this..  We fish for the pleasure of it and because we love it, and yes for the odd meal, I eat fish.. I find more thrill in the fight then on the plate.. 95% of what I catch go back to catch another day..  That said if I caught them within the spirit of the law it is well within my rights to enjoy them for supper.  G"
201951,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-15 01:51:00,0,"Well thank you for trying to get my question answered Brian. And no I was not offended at all.  I personally think that if someone is not trying to intentionally snag fish and gets it relatively close to the mouth, eyes, its not a snagged fish and the fish took a swipe at it and missed.  I was even told that the rules in bass tournaments are that if a fish is hooked anywhere around the mouth it is a legal fish(Not necessarily in the mouth).  Can anyone confirm this?  Just if anyone is wondering? All fish kept were hooked in the mouth. But If I had not caught one all day and caught one under the chin? I would probably keep it."
201956,Daplumma,2008-05-15 01:54:00,1961,Sorry to edit your response but these lines sre the crux of OFC.Well said! Joe
201983,Fish Farmer,2008-05-15 02:41:00,2234,"It's wrong to keep a snagged fish. Catching it on the mouth is a fine line. But You think a guy spends $100.00 dollars in gas to get a couple fish for the table, he's going to throw it back because it was caught on the outside of the mouth, I doubt it. Guy's that live near Simoce don't have to worry, you have them any time you want. You can go every day and get one. Good point Brian, I'm not throwing a stone at you, I'm just jealous you live up there   good post. I don't disagree with you. I sooner shot a snagger. I know a few U.S. Buddy's that are second thinking coming to Canada now because there is a 4 fish limit plus slot. They spend a lot of money hear, gas ,food accommodations, beer, etc. then go home with no fish. Their second thinking. This gas thing is killing things. I used to go fishing every day, now I go when I get 2,3,4 guys to split on the gas. It's a lose,lose situation."
202072,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-15 13:03:00,0,"  I agree. I wanted to go fishing today but $40 of gas plus $10 launch is just too much to go fish for 2-3 hours and a couple of whitefish to show. And that is the closest place!!!!  I don't think most Americans come to Canada to keep fish. They come to catch fish(Sport) and the slot limit will improve the fishing. The gas is the problem.  I actually support the new Kawartha rules. It is unfortunate for guys like you coming from Hamilton to the Kawarthas. I hear ya. But overall, they finally got it right. With only one fish over 18 inches, so you don't go home empty handed. Two thumbs up.  Oh and back to the topic? I just had my first whitefish fry in fish Crisp. Roasted Garlic & Butter ROCKS! Not as good as pickeral but right up there! And the fish is loaded with meat. Even the cats liked it. They didn't even leave the scales. Just parts of the head.lol"
202155,Guest gbfisher,2008-05-15 15:11:00,0,In the mouth or let it go. All fish!  Whitefish will try and inhale the spoon while it lies on the bottom and it's why the Williams ice jig has side hooks. They can inhale the whole lure with out a problem. Any lure can foul hook fish.

202353,misfish,2008-05-15 21:27:00,29133,"I would like to thank all, for thier input and this thread. It did not get locked down as people kept it civil. Good info here and hope it kinda clears the question and helps those that were wondering along with Johnny.  Happy hooken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in the yap.  Brian"
201784,misfish,2008-05-14 22:19:00,29133," DAWG,whats yer point? What do you do with the fish? Intentional or not.   WE NEED CLAIRIFACATION.  I believe what Capt said is the best so far. If the CO is there,yer releasing it."
201787,misfish,2008-05-14 22:20:00,29133, One that cares. Does that answer question??????????????
201788,Sinker,2008-05-14 22:20:00,8692,"Party fishing is another story.   Just so you know. The CO was standing over my shoulder as I bonked that whitie on the head and added it to my limit.......he told me it was ""close enough"".........I asked him first.  If its hooked in the side or the fin or the tail.......then sure....release it.  Close to the mouth......you make the call.......I keep the odd one.....so what?  Call the CO.....you won't get an answer anyways!!  Sinker"
201790,forrest,2008-05-14 22:25:00,1032," I think you have to and to that sentence.....""one that cares"" and is a glutton for punishment.  I would think that a lot of COs care but are not about to subject themselves to an onslaught of forum activity.  Hence they keep quiet about their status. Do you think that COs do not know about this and other fishing forums?  Do you think that because they are not here to answer our questions, they do not care?  A silly argument, really.  forrest"
201794,Terry,2008-05-14 22:27:00,14456,"ok  I believe only in the mouth counts but I have seen often with the multi hook spoons where the hook is clearly in the mouth, but as soon as it starts up the hole in the ice, it is ripped out of the mouth and catches somewhere else  or falls out completely and you reach down the hole and grab the fish.....legal or not"

201799,misfish,2008-05-14 22:34:00,29133," No dought forrest, they are watching,big brother sorta speak. Wouldnt it be great though, if there was a place to ask the CO and get a direct definitive answer to a question?????????"
201800,Casey123,2008-05-14 22:36:00,461," Thanks, I was looking for this paragraph, you saved me the troubles....  Anyone not clear on this??????????????"
201801,Sinker,2008-05-14 22:37:00,8692,"  If you asked a panel of 10 CO's, you'd get some different answers. The CO just enforces what he thinks is right........."
201806,Greencoachdog,2008-05-14 22:40:00,8163," Someone that foul hooks a fish will more than likely release it, a snagger will keep all he can get."
201807,misfish,2008-05-14 22:42:00,29133, LOL Maybe this is the problem ???????????
201808,misfish,2008-05-14 22:44:00,29133," Oh you mean like the guys that fish with that 1-0 treble with a bit of pink yarn on it,trying to catch a spawing salmon in the rivers? LOL"
201811,xrap,2008-05-14 22:50:00,683,"I once caught a catfish that sucked the bait through it's gills and swallowed it, would that be considered as a snagged fish?"
201813,forrest,2008-05-14 22:53:00,1032," I can see the scene now club raised in hand: sinker: ""Am I good?"" co: ""close enough"" fish: sigh.... sinker: with a big smile turns and whallops the poor little critter.   lol"
201814,misfish,2008-05-14 22:57:00,29133,mf ??????????? ME.  NOT
201817,kayak fisher,2008-05-14 23:01:00,66,"People like us who care enought to sit here and debate the semantics of the regulations are most definitely not the problem.  What if a fish swallows the hook, it is hooked in the stomach, not the mouth.  If you take the regulations by the word, this fish is illegal.  If it is hooked through the gills from the inside, It is illegal.  Good luck reviving it when you let it go.  You are not allowed to bow-fish after daylight.  Who decides EXACTLY what time that is?  You, the CO or the weather network?  This is trivial.   You should know, in general what is wrong or right, and you act accordingly.  Now excuse me, I have to go and register my cloth, portable ice hut (with no floor) with the ministry because the base area is 21.51 square feet.  Cheers"
201827,misfish,2008-05-14 23:13:00,29133,"Maybe I should of just asked IF YOU WERE TO CATCH A WHITIE OTHER THEN IN THE MOUTH,WOULD YOU RELEASE IT?  Guess buddy was right,it just may get locked.  am I for caring."
201829,danbo,2008-05-14 23:17:00,2646,What a hack will do when nobodies lookin' is a shame! Some don't care & never will. I figure Karma catches up in the end..
201840,Casey123,2008-05-14 23:41:00,461," This is based on sunrise/sunset as defined by Enviroment Canada, the info is free on theri website, the same applies for hunting regs."
201846,Fisherman,2008-05-14 23:52:00,7201,"Okay, suppose the fish can digest at a real fast rate and can poop out the hook and attached line, is it then caught by the arse or through the mouth...  or, is the fish ultimately trolling with a line and bare hook?  Inquisitive minds need to know, and some need a sign.."
201850,Marko,2008-05-14 23:59:00,854,"Too many people have their own opinions on this thats why it may get locked. Some folk may get upset over that fish being kept even tho it was not hooked inside the mouth but to common brain its obvious that the fish went for the bait and maybe missed, never fished for whities so i dont really know. Off the topic tho: In the past few weeks i have seen people take pictures with fish that is out of season and under the picture it would state that the quick pick was taken and the fish was let go. Not much if anything was said. Today little girl was in the pic with her first bass and the next thing you know people started threatening each other  . Either there is double standard on this board or we really have sank to a new low."
201853,bigfish1965,2008-05-15 00:02:00,3382,"Don't forget the regs we read are not the actual laws, but a SUMMARY as it says on the booklet itself. It is a mash-up of provincial and federal laws. They can, however, be used as a defense in court. Since they choose to use the wording 'by the mouth' one would assume that the inner mouth and lip areas would be fine. Especially when, as Dawg points out, walleye and bass like to use side attacks when they are especially agressive. Just use common sense and always err on the side of caution. Stop looking for loop holes and just read the regs..both summary and full...if you want a better understanding of them all. There are several CO's who come to this site on a regular basis. I've spoken to a few of them and they would never come out and say who they are cause of stuff like this...often the truth is the rules are so poorly written (as in the case of OOS pics) and so much ambiguity, that we are often left up to our OWN ETHICS to determine what we should do. They are, after all, our resources. Should we not be looking for ways to protect them and use sensible and fair harvest, not spend time arguing about where that exact line is between fair and foul hooked? I've seen all kinds of browns and chinooks caught in the side of the head and if you watch video of the swiping at spoons you'll know why...their aim sucks. But, the hook being in the top of the noggin and not in the mouth...even though the fish intended to strike and was not purposefully foul hooked, does not make it a legit fish."
201855,bigfish1965,2008-05-15 00:04:00,3382,Our rules ask that you do not post out of season pics. No double standard at all. Bass are not out of season everywhere in the province right now. Lots of year round fishing for them.
201899,Greencoachdog,2008-05-15 00:50:00,8163,"Actually the law states through the mouth, it does not specify through the inside out or through the outside in."
201907,Daplumma,2008-05-15 01:06:00,1961,"I like the part about the rules in Alabannannas saying that if you catch the fish in the head its all good.In the fine state of Virginia I haven't heard of such a thing.Then again,we are allowed to shoot some species with a bow and arrow and or shotgun.

201774,misfish,2008-05-14 22:07:00,29133,"YO YO YO HOLD UP FELLAS. Sinker Im not sure I would be to admiting to that bud.I was hoping to get a clear ruling on this topic. Snag is snagged,weather it be the fish swiping at the lure or not. Man if only we had a CO just to clearify on this.  Im not trying to stir the pot here,just trying to clear this question and help others.  Heres one for ya. Fishing BP,and we all know they can come in there, thick as thieves. Guys were keeping everything they nailed. Weather in the yap or the ars or the side fin. I seen these two guys come out,set up a portable and just sit there. They didnt even use thier auger to drill holes. Give away. I get a fish on,fight it for awhile and bring it to the hole. Like all of a sudden, I got this swarm of fellas with gafs at my hole. I say back off will ya,it,s probly fouled as it was taking line. Sure enough,it was in the fin. Buddy tried to gaf er,I said not a chance buddy,look behind ya. Didnt take long for the guy in green to be heads over the crowd. 5 charges laid for foul hooked fish and guys passing fish over to thier buddies after catching thier limit.  Now theres another kettle of fish to open after this. Do you pass your catch to yer buddy after you got yer 2?"
201776,misfish,2008-05-14 22:10:00,29133,"I would be surprised if it does. No reason for it to be. It,s a legit question."
201779,Greencoachdog,2008-05-14 22:12:00,8163,"In my opinion there's a difference between foul hooked and snagged fish. Snagged is intentional, foul hooked is not."
201780,forrest,2008-05-14 22:13:00,1032," What CO in their right mind would make themselves known?  they would be barraged with arguments and questions.    What is the exact wording of the law.  The previous reference to the regulations what pretty clear ""right inside the mouth"" was not mentioned, how about ""just inside the mouth""?; not to mentioned 'hooked in the throat'.  forrest"
