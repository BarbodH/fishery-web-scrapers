That's the old 12 hour administrative suspension.  Equal to about 1 beer in half an hour.  And for people wondering where local cruisers are during rush hour, mugging people at speed limit changes.  Top of 410 where it changes to 60km/h is a favourite."

This guy will most likely get dangerous driving causing death....as for his licence, he'll get driving contrary to conditions and because the Ministry takes alcohol related offences seriously he'll never get his licence again ....  as for the ""small amount of alcohol in his blood, but if he's involved in an accidence ""impaired driving"" charges are possible"" you can be charged with impaired driving even if you don't blow over .08 as well as if you don't cause an accident...."
202225,fishing n autograph,2008-05-15 17:03:00,2540," Not sure if you've ever worked a shift as a Police Officer during rush hour......  But i can tell you the reason you never see one during rush hour is because they're busy dealing with more important issues....peak time for priorty calls are from 10:00 AM to probably 0300 in the morning....   the OPP have 7 officers a platoon in the Aurora Detachment covering the the 400, 404, 407 and 401....maybe that's why...there would be more but caledonia is demanding more officers"
202638,Danubian,2008-05-16 14:17:00,65," Wouldn't then be safer to also not allow any alcohol for full G drivers if they drive? I mean, if someone knows he's allowed some drink and still can drive he'll probably take his chances more easier than when knowing that it's not legal to drink and drive. Afterall, the law states about alcohol concetration in blood, which is the result of a combination of factors from which the most important are probably one's body mass, qty of alcohol and qty of food ingested. Without lab tests, is hard to guess how much is one's ""load"". Let alone that different people have different levels of alcohol tolerance.  This relative ""freedom"" is rather creating confusion and eventually leading to more trouble than just saying ""alcohol and driving is against the law for everybody""."
