202035,NAC,2008-05-15 10:27:00,369,"that's pretty cool!  now if that a mutant walleye, would that be considered good ""hand-eye co-ordination""?"
202068,Marko,2008-05-15 12:46:00,854,"If thats a mutant walleye you wouldnt be sticking your hands in there lol, at least i hope not. I wonder if those fish can break your wrist if you freak out and try to rip your hand out of its mouth. It looks great tho"
