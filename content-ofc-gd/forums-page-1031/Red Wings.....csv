201695,misfish,2008-05-14 19:17:00,29133, I thought I did MARTY.
201697,Stoty,2008-05-14 19:20:00,2910, AMEN!!!! There's a guy that knows what he's talking about.
201702,JohnAB,2008-05-14 19:33:00,178,"Stoty, did you fall down and hit your head as a youngster? Lidstrom top 3 defensemen of all time. Please Louise! Oh to laugh!  As Don Cherry said, anyone who votes for Lidstrom as a top defensemen and the Norris trophy wouldn't know a  defenceman even if they slept with Bobby Orr."
201706,Stoty,2008-05-14 19:34:00,2910,"Sorry Johnny, stats dont lie."
201712,JohnAB,2008-05-14 19:48:00,178,"Stats don't always tell the truth either. Lidstrom was only plus 40 on a team that was as a team plus 70 at least. Not that impressive. Actually kind of disappointing, especially in the weakest division in hockey.  And secondary scoring, hmmmm. Scoring in playoffs goes Crosby, Malkin, Zetterberg, Datsyuk, Franzen, Hossa, Malone and Hudler. I fail to see the big difference in this vaunted Detroit spread out scoring punch? Also remember Pittsburgh has played one less game as well."
201716,Stoty,2008-05-14 19:52:00,2910,"Disappointing?? He was 2nd overall in the league....right behind Datsyuk.  Geesh, you have pretty high standards eh. If you dont think +40 is impressive, or that he isnt in the top 10 defensemen of all time."
201719,JohnAB,2008-05-14 19:59:00,178,Bobby Orr was plus 128 in one season so plus 40 is not impressive.
201721,danbo,2008-05-14 20:03:00,2646,
201724,JohnAB,2008-05-14 20:13:00,178,"Stoty if stats don't lie then here ya go  Ray Bourque: Career plus minus of 528, averaged .98 points per game in his career.  Lidstrom: Career plus minus of 378, averages .75 points per game.  Oops, looks like Ray kind of dominates in every category there huh?"
201750,Stoty,2008-05-14 21:24:00,2910,Bourque - 23 seasons Lidstrom - 15 seasons
201764,JohnAB,2008-05-14 21:48:00,178,So Bourque played longer???? Still has a better plus minus rating and averages more points per game.
201770,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-14 21:59:00,3761,Yup Dallas is going to win tonight!!!!!!
201773,danbo,2008-05-14 22:05:00,2646,"Atta boy,Mikey!"
201775,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-14 22:09:00,3761,"Ya man, me and danbo both pulling for Pittsburgh!!!, no needd to tell everyone that, im sure everyone already knows there going to win the cup"
201835,steve_paul,2008-05-14 23:29:00,658," Stats got McCabe on the 2006 Canadian Olympic Team  And furthermore:  Marshmallows  Leafs in 09  Tiller  Net      (Sorry just waiting for dinner to cook, please go back to talking amongst yourselves)"
201844,danbo,2008-05-14 23:51:00,2646,
201970,danbouck,2008-05-15 02:08:00,4380,   You forgot white bucket
201686,JohnAB,2008-05-14 18:53:00,178,"Stoty, he probably sqeaks in. But I rate a bunch before him though. Lidstrom ahs never done nothing for me as a defencemen. He has no mean streak."
201687,Stoty,2008-05-14 18:55:00,2910, How so? The fans dont pick the winners of the awards. The winner is selected in a poll of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association.  Lidstrom: 70 pts (lead defensemen) +40 (2nd overall in the league) Averaged 26:43 of ice time per game (4th overall in the league)  Considering he has been putting up those types of numbers for the past 12 seasons....  Not to mention he has 938 points and is a +378 over his career...  I would say that he is a deserving Norris Trophy Winner and one of the top 3 defensemen of all time.
201688,bucktail,2008-05-14 18:57:00,1857,"I thinik the Zetterberg-datsyuk line is the same offensively as the best on the Penguins. Detroit is much more disciplined team then any in the East. You won't see them giving the blue line up to Malkin or Crosby. Detroit in 6 because of much better team defence and discipline. Also most good young teams have to lose one before they win one.....just like the Wings did to NJ before they wone there last 2 cups. Also have to put Lidstrom ahead of Bourque, better positional player and skater, both are awesome. Lidstrom almost never caught out of position so you never notice him out there. kinda like a good referee."
199090,Stoty,2008-05-09 12:25:00,2910,"We are on a roll!!! What a great game! Heck, didnt even look like there was another team out there last night!"
199109,muskymike,2008-05-09 12:59:00,772,I see you are still in 3rd on in the Pool. B(*$&^%^#. hahahaha  Yeah they outplayed Dallas in every possible way last night. I should have followed suit and went with one team...
199110,danbo,2008-05-09 13:02:00,2646,Pittsburg rox!
199111,Stoty,2008-05-09 13:03:00,2910," Yes, they did for sure. Marty cant handle a couple big boys in front of him (Franzen and Holmstrom). Dallas is a good team, but they cannot handle the fire-power Detroit has. IMO, No-one can.  I just wish there were no trades in the hockey pool, then I would have 1st locked up, because I would still have my whole team!"
199113,danbo,2008-05-09 13:05:00,2646,
199121,Stoty,2008-05-09 13:12:00,2910,"Hey Danbo....  The Red Wings will dispose of Dallas quickly, and be waiting to see who they play in the finals. PIT hasnt done well against PHI this year, and PHI is going to physically beat the crap out of them, so should be an interesting series.  Even if PIT makes it to the finals, they will be no match for my Wings!"
199123,danbo,2008-05-09 13:14:00,2646,
199131,Marko,2008-05-09 13:28:00,854,I think danbo here is trying to start something haha. Wings are my second favorite team right after the sabres.
199133,danbo,2008-05-09 13:31:00,2646,
199142,bucktail,2008-05-09 13:40:00,1857,They looked great but Dallas looked like a truck had run over them. I ALMOST felt bad for Dallas!  Go Wings!
199148,Stoty,2008-05-09 13:47:00,2910,"Ya, Dallas looked exhausted for sure. Maybe DET is just that good, that they make their opponent look that bad!"
199177,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-09 14:38:00,3761,Pullin for Pitsburg here....my guess is Dallas over Detroit.
199313,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-09 20:16:00,0,I think Dallas played well. Detroit just capitalized on power plays and one of those goals shouldn't have counted. Goalie interference.  Detroit was well rested and they came out fast. Those European players can really pass the puck around well.....  Dallas took out 2 very tough teams so I doubt the series will end quickly.  And the Flyers? They are playing rough and tough like the old New Jersey devils. But I doubt they will be able to hold off Pittsburgh.
199315,Stoty,2008-05-09 20:19:00,2910,"PHI will give them a run for their money, but I think PIT will come out on top for sure. And, just found out Timonen is gone for the series...so thats a HUGE blow to the PHI blueline.  PIT/DET will be a great and HIGHLY skilled final!"
199317,danbo,2008-05-09 20:23:00,2646,
200420,Stoty,2008-05-12 12:37:00,2910,"Just 2 more wins for the Red Wings!!!! wooooooooooo  That a boy Ribeiro....no wonder he is one of the most hated players in the game. Not only was that completely gutless and cheap, its also (probably) going to hurt his team. Completely selfish.  But on the other hand....will make it that much easier for the Wings to defeat the Stars."
200473,muskymike,2008-05-12 13:56:00,772,Oh stoty you are gonna open another can of worms
200482,Stoty,2008-05-12 14:14:00,2910,"Hee hee hee, makes it more interesting.  But apparently they didnt suspend him.....so I think tonights game might be a fantastic game for everyone to watch! Can you say ""target""?!"
200887,Stoty,2008-05-13 02:38:00,2910,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 5-2. Total domination!!!!!!!!   1 more win baby!!!!!!!!!  Dallas who?
200890,chickenhawk,2008-05-13 02:43:00,612,Yeah the wings looked good tonight.....Datsyuk put on a show!
200892,danbo,2008-05-13 02:45:00,2646,Congrats..
200948,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-13 10:56:00,3761,"Yup, Detroit will win, and so will Pittsburgh...the only difference is Pittsburgh will win the Stanley Cup!"
200951,danbo,2008-05-13 11:01:00,2646,Atta boy..you're right!!
200995,Stoty,2008-05-13 12:19:00,2910,"I wouldnt be counting your chickens just yet!!  Going to be a great series for sure, but I am gonna take DET in 6  Then again, it doesnt really matter who wins, because I am making a bunch of money just for DET making it to the Cup Final!"
200996,Stoty,2008-05-13 12:20:00,2910,Looks like we have a new leader in the Playoff Pool too
