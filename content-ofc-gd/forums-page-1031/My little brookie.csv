201748,crappieperchhunter,2008-05-14 21:20:00,2582,Love the colors on those little stream brookies. Thx for sharin.
201749,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-14 21:21:00,1362,Wow...that's an unusual color for a Brookie...did you keep it??
201752,huntervasili,2008-05-14 21:24:00,1604,Some nice colours in that Brookie!
201753,mattyk,2008-05-14 21:27:00,2110,thats a real pretty brookie!
201758,Danubian,2008-05-14 21:37:00,65," No, I didn't keep it. Too beautiful to kill. I have another picture from a year ago, different stream, though:   It's an even smaller fish, but the colors on it are gorgeous..."

201961,MJL,2008-05-15 01:58:00,2427,"Simply stunning  In all the years of angling, I have yet to catch one of those.  Looks like catching one will be added to my life's To-do list before I die.  Great pics."
202007,ehg,2008-05-15 03:28:00,2666,"Those are a couple of nicely coloured brookies. Nice time of year for stroll through headwaters, despite bugs.  ehg"
202010,Mike the Pike,2008-05-15 03:36:00,3421,Cool
202011,Musky or Specks,2008-05-15 03:45:00,2710,I have a little spot like that the colours are absolutely beautiful. We call them halloween brookies because of the orange colours here is a pick of one    And Im not even going to be secretive and black out the background this is what they come out of    Those colours are so beautiful on your fish. Easy to see how one can become a dedicated brook trout angler.
202070,ehg,2008-05-15 12:58:00,2666, That's funny 'musky or specks' i've caught many specks from places like that. Around farmland at headwaters of Saugeen or Grand R.  About 20 yrs. ago i caught brookies like that from culvert on side of 115 on way to Peterborough. Turns out the little flow emptied into Cavan R. which emptied into Otonabee R. then Rice Lake etc.. Weird! Brookies are in most headwaters of Ontario rivers if you look around a bit.  ehg
202074,Victor,2008-05-15 13:04:00,1609,"amazing colors. That has to be the most beautiful fish i have seen thus far, makes a great wallpaper!  Thanks for sharing!"
