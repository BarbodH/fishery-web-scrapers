201389,Rich,2008-05-14 02:31:00,3927,Sugarpacket and I headed out tonight after work for some local carp fishing. No size here but the numbers make up for it. Always catch a ton of carp on ultra light tackle.

201433,Greencoachdog,2008-05-14 03:50:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!  Nice clean fish too!!! (as clean as a Carp can be
201436,Markus,2008-05-14 04:01:00,25,Nice to see the carp are active Rich.  I'm gonna give em a go myself this weekend.  Good fishin.
201519,Victor,2008-05-14 13:00:00,1609,Definitely a nice way to spend a couple of hours after work.  Rich: Love your t-shirt   Cool how the dorsal fin on the first fish stays up  Sugarpacket: the fish you got in the 2nd pic is gotta be the cutest carp i have ever seen lol ... usually the smaller one i catch (1-3lb range) have a silvery color to them and they're more like the shape of a sunfish rather than a long bullet.
201540,mattyk,2008-05-14 13:33:00,2110,thanks for the report.
201600,wolfville,2008-05-14 15:17:00,396,"Rich, I get my car tomorrow.... and the carp in your pictures are too skinny, I need to feed them some more food. LOL"

201966,AzuluSpookd,2008-05-15 02:04:00,348,Rich....I'm telling ya...I gotta spot for you  We were out on GB today...in shallow water....a HUGE bay that is extremely shallow and moving along with the trolling motor.........and I have NEVER seen so many carp in my life!! There were hundreds and hundreds and some massive ones. Unbelievable. They must have been spawning in the mud?  You and Photoz would have been in heaven
201978,muskymike,2008-05-15 02:21:00,772,Nice job Rich.
