201705,splashhopper,2008-05-14 19:34:00,2931,"i was trucking to one of my favourite holes last weekend and didn't have my line tight enough on my rod.  when i went to set it up, i   was hooked,  to an idiot!  Now I have a pin hole in it that has  sloow leak.  What can I use to fix this before the weekend? (I put a pen mark on the wader where the hook got caught.)  thankx"
201709,wuchikubo,2008-05-14 19:43:00,1114,Depends on the material it is made of.  PVC or Neoprene?
201725,bassfighter,2008-05-14 20:13:00,366,"Use Goop or shoe goo sold at canadian tire, it is so strong and somewhat flexible, I used it on my inflatable boat.  I also applied it on my waders and it works and glued everything well."

201781,danbo,2008-05-14 22:14:00,2646,Take the waders into the bathroom at night with a flashlight. turn light off & flashlight on to find leaks.

201859,splashhopper,2008-05-15 00:09:00,2931,thanks all.
201954,MJL,2008-05-15 01:52:00,2427,"I use the UV wader repair stuff made by Loon - It's actually always in one of my wader pockets.  Provided its sunny outside or you have access to a UV lamp, it cures within minutes regardless of whether the material is dry or wet.  Certainly beats the 3-8hr cure time of Aquaseal.  I applied it to a few holes last season and the patch of hardened goo is still going strong."
201957,splashhopper,2008-05-15 01:54:00,2931,  where do i buy this stuff?  as i am usually hikimg up river and hope to stay there for most of the day too.
201958,MJL,2008-05-15 01:56:00,2427, I got mine in a fly shop in Mississauga.  I think it's called WithAFly.  I think any tackle shop that sells Loon products should be able to get it for you.
201959,ccmtcanada,2008-05-15 01:56:00,7971,Darn it....people helped out here....I was going to say they are now junk and I'll come pick them up from you to take them to the special wader dump near my place.
201960,muskymike,2008-05-15 01:58:00,772," ummm why the bathroom, why not any dark room?"
201964,splashhopper,2008-05-15 02:03:00,2931, ummm... my wife is gonna think i have gone right off the deep end if i go in the bathroom with my waders?  what am i gonna tell her I was doing with all that rubber in there?
201967,HTHM,2008-05-15 02:04:00,4082,"'cause it was a crappy thing to have happen, ergo, the bathroom is the appropriate place for detection and repair."
202123,danbo,2008-05-15 14:23:00,2646,Thanx HTH!
