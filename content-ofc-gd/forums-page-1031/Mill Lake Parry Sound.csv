202522,Lostchild,2008-05-16 03:05:00,153,Thank you very much!  From what I gather I will be staying almost directly across from the launch. A short boat ride but a long car ride.
202525,e-z-out,2008-05-16 03:11:00,1052,what resort are you staying at?
202529,Lostchild,2008-05-16 03:26:00,153,"It is a friends cottage not a resort. Usually I do the camping/tent thing on the 2-4 weekend, if the forecast is right, I will be glad I am cottaging this year."
