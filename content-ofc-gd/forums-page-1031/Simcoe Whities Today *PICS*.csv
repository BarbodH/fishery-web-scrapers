Guys beside us must have landed 20 before we landed another, I had two spoons with me and thats it, they werent working too well.  We moved to 64 feet, and started dropshotting GULP ALIVE minnows instead of jigging spoons, caught 8 more in about 30 mins.  nothing big though, glad for Kelli to get a couple.  Water was still only 48-49 degrees.      "
