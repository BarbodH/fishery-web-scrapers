Seeing as I already had my fishing stuff in my car, I talked him into coming down with me and wetting a line. I was using light spinning gear, and tossed an assortment of very small lures. We caught some fish, and I ended up hooking into my PB steelhead - a beauty 28 incher. I had an absolute blast, but I gotta get ready for the cottage this weekend, it's gonna be great. Enjoy the pics.      "
