It was totally disgusting,everything you could think of and even piles of human fecies all around the trails and parking area. Almost every receipt that I picked up off the ground came from the city.Clearly people have the attitude that if they don't live around the area they wont have to see the garbage.  Well it looks like I was right, a great area that I have fish myself for over 15 years and I'm sure many others have as well is now PRIVATE. fenced off with no fishing, no trespassing signs. I talked to the owner and it seems they have had enough of picking up garbage. This is just the first of what's to come. If people don't stop abusing the fishing area it will be totally private.  well I was there I also watched a guy who was clearly too lazy to walk the trail DRIVE HIS SUV ACROSS A SEEDED GRAIN FIELD!!!! I would be ticked if it was my grain. Some people have no common sense. He had no idea who's property he was driving on and said he wasn't from the area.  come on guys and gals how hard is it to bring out what you take in??????"
202608,splashhopper,2008-05-16 12:55:00,2931,"i always bring an extra small p[lastci garbage bag with me. My dad tought me when iwas a kid to leave something in better shape than you found it and that included the river banks. Each weekend i come out of the river, i got a full bags of timmies cups and beer cans !"

202623,Victor,2008-05-16 13:35:00,1609, Good on you splashhopper! More of us should be doing this and educating others at the same time.
202630,mattyk,2008-05-16 13:57:00,2110,people are just slobs! Serves them right. Soon there will be no shore spots left for fishing.
202635,misfish,2008-05-16 14:16:00,29133,"Are you talking about the bend area? To bad. Great spot to hot shot a wiggler. To bad theres so many slobs.  There also the other spot down the side rd that was a great place to fish,but like this,it is no more."
202662,rhare,2008-05-16 16:25:00,387,"   Yeah its the big pool at the bend, caught so many fish there over the years"
202663,misfish,2008-05-16 16:32:00,29133,Yep it WAS  a great place. Caught many a fish there and even got my first Skammie there. What a real shame.
