My father and I are currently looking to take a trip this summer to B.C for some salmon fishing - likely Queen Charlotte area.  Was wondering if anyone could provide any advise as to location, time of year etc.. or share there experience.  It's quite expensive and we're just wondering if it's worth the $ (I've heard it's quite the experience).  Thanks in advance"

202551,kemper,2008-05-16 05:03:00,2232,HOLD ON.  all i can say is hooking into a big tyee will tire you out.  By far the strongest fish I have ever battled!
