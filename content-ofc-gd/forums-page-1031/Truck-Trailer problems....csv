201902,Bernie,2008-05-15 00:55:00,3190,If I can help I don't mind at all. Thank you for the kind words.
202377,Gerritt,2008-05-15 22:45:00,6129,"Finally Sweet Success!!! I pulled apart the Power Distribution Box.. and low and behold the problem was evident.. the wire was rubbing on a piece of metal.. wore through the insulation there was no metal left.. just green powder.... Finally that is fixed! then I turn on the lights... only one side is working... dang!!! found the problem.. a quick splice on the trailer and everything is as good as new!!  Talk about coming down to the wire!! (Pun intended)  Thanks again everyone for you're help, It wont be soon forgotten  G"
202400,Terry,2008-05-15 23:30:00,14456,  so the brown wire wasn't getting enough power...  I did think the problem had to be with the truck  glad you figured it out trailer light problems are one of the hardest things to figure  you have earned a beer or 2
201820,Gerritt,2008-05-14 23:08:00,6129,"  Nope..  I seem to have isolated the problem to the power distribution box under the hood on the truck.... I have 12v @ the fuse socket (So I know it is getting power), and only 1.3v @ the relay socket so there is a problem between the fuse and the relay... likely corrosion  I also have 1.3v @ the back of the truck..) The truck has its own power source for the trailer...  So it looks like we have to pull open the Power Distro box.. But I am going to McGyver it for now... I am going to Jump the fuse to the relay with a bit of wire.. it will suffice until I return home and have more time to take my time and fix it properly.  Thanks for all you're help folks.. And Bernie thank you for listening to my complaining on the phone while I picked you're brains LOL  G"

He helped me heaps.. sent me schematics etc.. gave advice and after doing the physical testing we determined this is the probable problem.. all over the phone.  He certainly is a great asset and a good friend.  G
