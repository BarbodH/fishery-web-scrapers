202236,fisher,2008-05-15 17:18:00,451,Plan on going to Simcoe tomorrow and just want confirmation that my 5 year old son's limit is 2 as well (even though he has no licence)?  Thanks.
202238,capt bruce,2008-05-15 17:23:00,820,"ITs two each , but HE has to catch them, not 4 for you just because he is siting in boat ."
202239,FLEX ROD,2008-05-15 17:23:00,394,"Your son will have the same limit as you do as far as I know, as that is what I was told by MNR when I check for my son. What ever licence you have that is what he has.  FLEX"
202244,fisher,2008-05-15 17:29:00,451,"I hear you - I knew that was coming.  Rest assured, I want him to catch his fish.  That is part of the fun - and teaching.  I'll bring an extra rod or two just in case one goes into the drink."
202245,mdej,2008-05-15 17:29:00,98," Interesting, never heard of that rule.  The website states that ""Canadian residents need an Outdoors Card to fish in Ontario if they are at least 18 years old but have not reached their 65th birthday.""  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_164832.html  I have always just assumed that it was considered a sporting licence, never even considered it being tied to the adult.  I mean 16yr olds can fish on their own without supervision."
202246,ccmtcanada,2008-05-15 17:30:00,7971,"Seems they conform to the Sport Fishing License rules....here's an excerpt from the regulations.  Anglers do not need a fishing licence if they are: 1. Residents of Ontario and Canada under 18, or 65 years of age or older, and in possession of their birth certificate. 2. Disabled Ontario and Canadian residents, eligible for and in possession of either: - a Canadian National Institute for the Blind National Identity Card; or - an Ontario Ministry of Transportation Accessible Parking Permit. 3. Ontario and Canadian residents in possession of their birth certificate and accompanied by and requiring the direct assistance of another person to fish and to follow applicable fishing laws due to a condition of mental impairment or a developmental disability, a learning disability or dysfunction, or a mental disorder. Those who qualify to fish without a licence must follow the same catch and possession limits as a Sport Fishing Licence."
202254,gone_fishin,2008-05-15 17:41:00,481,"  Perfect description! i don't know where people get the ""it's the same as the parent/guardian"" from!?!? kids have their own limits and follow the sport fishing licence regulations."
202261,fisher,2008-05-15 17:49:00,451,Thanks - that's great.  Now why couldn't I find that when I tried searching google/MNR site!
202266,gone_fishin,2008-05-15 17:56:00,481,here's the link for the fishing regulations online.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_163615.html
202271,capt bruce,2008-05-15 18:08:00,820,"Sorry Fisher if I came off wrong , just wanted to point out that hes fishing as if he has a licence , so the same rules apply , BUT so many forget the HES FISHING PART . not ment for you personally , but as a warning to others reading this , CO's might be hard to find at times ,but (at least the ones I have delt with) THEY AINT STUPID its and hard to get a 5 year old to answer his questions with less than the truth  .."
202298,fisher,2008-05-15 19:18:00,451,  No offence taken...just figured someone was bound to point it out.   And it serves as a good reminder to everyone.
202303,Terry,2008-05-15 19:25:00,14456,"however he has to be able to catch it himself if he is Disabled, you can help him reel in the fish,  so if you have to hold his rod or reel in for him , it goes against your limit"
202321,mdej,2008-05-15 20:01:00,98," But based on the thread for the other day, can he not ""gift"" his limit to his son?  Or maybe that was just related to possession rules."
202327,Terry,2008-05-15 20:18:00,14456,"yes he can gift it to his son but, it still goes against his daily limit, not his possession limit, so he can't fish till the next day"
202351,gone_fishin,2008-05-15 21:21:00,481," he would still be allowed to fish, he would just have to release everything he caught after he had reached his limit."
202356,Terry,2008-05-15 21:32:00,14456,yes that is correct
202358,Canuck2fan,2008-05-15 21:49:00,1444,"I think people assume the licences are tied to a parent if you are a resident because for a NON RESIDENT they are..... Here is that part of the regs..... I know more than one person who has misunderstood this part of the regs.  Anyone who is not an Ontario or Canadian resident (see definitions, page 5) is considered a non-resident for the purposes of fishing licence regulations. Most non-residents need an Ontario fishing licence to fish in Ontario. Specifically: • Non-residents 18 years of age and over must purchase a fishing licence. (NOTE: Non-residents 65 years of age or older are not exempt from requiring a licence.) • Non-residents under 18 years of age may fish without a licence if accompanied by an adult who has a valid fishing licence. Any fish kept are part of the catch and possession limit of the person who holds the licence. As another option, non-residents under 18 years may purchase a licence to have their own limits. • For non-resident groups of children (at least five people under the age of 18 years) there is a special licence for members of an organized camp. This licence is available from ServiceOntario/ Ministry of Natural Resources offices (see page 96). NOTE: Non-residents camping on Crown lands in northwestern Ontario are subject to conservation licence limits except in the"

202500,gone_fishin,2008-05-16 02:28:00,481, i guess we better bust out the marshmallows too
202645,mdej,2008-05-16 14:36:00,98, Yes I just reread it and as you can imagine that was a type-O.  I have edited my original.
