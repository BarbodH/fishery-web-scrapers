200990,joonmoon,2008-05-13 11:59:00,528,"My wife and I finally got out to start the Pike season after what seemed like a long time since the opener only days ago. First fish was the biggest 26"" on my fav pink Bluefox second cast after launching.   She got her first a 22"" on a 6"" Huskyjerk trolling up the lake from the launch.  We fished from 2:30-5:30pm hitting some of the many hotspots we know of on the pond. I ended the day with 5 Pike landed, 2 short strikers and a Largie who after breaking water spit the Fox.  She picked up her second and final fish of the day on the troll back to the launch. A decent start to the season...and I'm ready to go again."
201012,johnnyb,2008-05-13 13:10:00,3413,Way to start your season!
201013,mattyk,2008-05-13 13:17:00,2110,thanks for sharing. That pike your wife caught has some pretty colours.
201014,snag,2008-05-13 13:21:00,1932," Yeah,  Looks like a hybrid.  Beautiful!"
201052,Victor,2008-05-13 14:53:00,1609,Nice fish! I love the color on your wife's fish too! Thanks for sharing!  Looks like you're finally showing your face?
201133,highdrifter,2008-05-13 17:20:00,2534, A hybrid?  An uneducated guess made by a novice... pppffffff  You're momy must have celebrated you coming in second place all your life..  pshaw!  HD
201268,jediangler,2008-05-13 22:46:00,1923,Well done bro and sis. I'm sure the number of other boats out there was much less than the opener on Saturday. Probably had the whole lake to yourselves.
201357,SBCregal,2008-05-14 01:19:00,688,"i was there monday afternoon as well, from about 430-630 or so, casting from the shore by the dam with no luck.  must have seen you two out there, werent many others on the water, nice catches!"
201441,Moosebunk,2008-05-14 04:11:00,3970,Spring piking is always a fun way to start the season.  Great getting the missus involved.
201655,joonmoon,2008-05-14 17:31:00,528,"It was a great day, 3 boats including ours. There was no way I was going to start the Pike season off without the better half...she usually smokes me on the water but that day the fish gods were smiling upon me. We fish together all the time and my guess is she out fishes me 2-1 on most occasions. Hey Victor I have been known to peek out behind a fish for a photo once in a while...lol."
201975,johnnyb,2008-05-15 02:14:00,3413,I heard someone pulled out a 15 lb-er from there today or yesterday.
202704,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-16 20:05:00,3761,"Cool, never cought a pike. I got the gear now, but still no fish. Looks like you 2 had fun."
