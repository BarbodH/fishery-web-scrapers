So we took the day off to pursue our favourte species.Black flies were out in full force today being real pest but fortunately only a small % were biting. There was a sparse hendrickson hatch going on but fish really werent moving to them so we left the fly rods in the Yukon and used mainly Panther Martins or dew worms. The day was more about trippin and hitting a lot of spots that we haven't hit in years. The day was beautiful but waters were very high and still remarkably cold for this time of the year.We caught  quite a few fish and I ended up bringing two home for dinner for myself. The biggest fish that was caught was a 15"" rainbow that I took on a PM in a heavy current run. The bugger slipped outta my hands and fell back into the river before I could kill it though so there is no picture.  A vert we hadnt seen in a while. Brook trout water just looooks like it should have fish in it. Its so clear and beautiful    The Halloween vert that I mentioned in another thread with a super stealthy approach     Happy Bday Bud enjoy those lovely brookies    One that I kept for dinner    That was typical of most of the fish that we caught coming in at 11""  All in all it was a great day finished off with a cold one on the tailgate. We are getting older though and after all that walking and bushwacking Im ready for bed."
