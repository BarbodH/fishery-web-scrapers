567161,Danubian,2011-03-29 04:06:00,65,"I guess most of you recently learned a bit more details on how a nuclear reactor works, so you realize that is quite complicated -if not impossible- to adjust the electricity output in just one hour, just because 1 million light bulbs have been turned off - that's probably less than 1% of the electricity that the reactor/powerplant produces usually. For a gas or coal powered turbine, this is pretty much similar: one hour is nothing, even if we'll turn off all our appliances. For hydro, it's useless: hydro is green; the water will flow down the river anyway...  So basically, turning off lights for just one hour has only a symbolic role - we're not gonna save the Planet. Not that way!  I didn't observe the Earth Hour. Didn't need to, and I'm saving enough electricity in the summer by not using my A/C too often -last year I totaled 8 days of use- and being ""green"" [once in a while] by riding my bicycle to work - once or twice a week. Not to mention that I'm not a big fan of Christmas lights...  Somehow, I imagine that during that hour the ""smart guys"" from the energy sector are just re-routing the power that is not used by the lightbulbs and sell it  to some industry sector, so the pollution effect will be twofold: once the emissions for producing the electricity and once more for using that power in some industrial process, which more likely has a significant carbon footprint and possibly produces some byproducts bad for the environment. It's just common sense to assume that this is more likely to happen, since electricity cannot be stored efficiently; once is produced, it needs to be spent immediately.  Just my 2c."

Dinner was at their house, so I made sure to turn everything off at home before leaving. Also turned down the temp. on the furnace.  My hot water tank is always set as low as possible. (just warm enough for showers) We don't turn on light outside unless we're expecting someone. The kids kept leaving the 2nd floor hall light on when they go to bed. Easy solution. I unscrewed the bulbs a couple of years ago and we haven't missed the extra lighting at all."

They want us to save energy, reduce consumption, and allegedly we'll do the earth a good thing and save money. We've done good at reducing consumption and hydro usage is down. What happens next? Hydro declares a shortfall in revenues due to an energy surplus and rewards us with increases in hydro rates, and smart meters. Then they  practically give away the surplus hydro south of the border rather than downscaling energy production. Why would I voluntarily choose to screw myself yet again."
