567288,kuhaman,2011-03-29 18:20:00,503,I am planning on a trip this July to West Nipissing resort. Has anyone from the board been there? We are staying at there Bear lake camp. Bear lake is supposed to have a decent musky population (never fished musky)What would be a couple of lures you would suggest for them? Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks Kuha

We targeted mostly pike, but ran into a few nice walleye and one monster that I never saw....either a big pike or muskie. We tried to put on lots of miles doing long runs at first, but when we finally took Ian's advice on where to fish, we got into them pretty good.  ALSO.....pay attention to the rocks....they are NOT motor-friendly. If I had to pick one lure, it'd be a green/white spinnerbait."

Definitely take your time and watch out for the rocks, they are every where.  Lures. The best lures are ones that you are familiar with and comfortable using. That being said, for those waters, I like gold/brass, orange/reds, clown pattern, suicks, jakes and husky jerks for the essox species  Walleye, I often use leeches or every day worms.  Have a great trip and post pics when you get back!"
