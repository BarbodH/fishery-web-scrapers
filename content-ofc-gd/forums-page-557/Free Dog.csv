Read the sales pitch below!    To good home--excellent guard dog. Owner cannot afford to feed him anymore, as there are no more drug pushers, thieves, murderers, or molesters left in the neighborhood for him to eat.  Most of them knew Jethro only by his Oriental street name, Ho Lee Sstufft   Wow..  Big dog, or photoshop, you guys are the pros, what do you think.."

567585,otter649,2011-03-30 19:45:00,118,That dog (snopes/Hercules) is part of The Urban Legends Image Quiz.....
567586,Billy Bob,2011-03-30 19:45:00,5865," Still interesting though...I'll bet they got the name ""Hercules"" from the movie ""Sandlot"""
567604,umKthxbye,2011-03-30 20:37:00,247, How do you figure its been photo shopped? I use photoshop often and those dogs are average that size. Not the big black dog but the brown one. Shadows are all going the same way and there isn't any inconsistencies to it.
567606,mercman,2011-03-30 20:45:00,7054,"looks real, but hard to say.shadows are right.position of the girls hands and fingers are right.Could be a very tiny girl  "

567615,Terry,2011-03-30 21:07:00,14456,looks real to me  but just seems bigger every time I look at it      
568162,Stoty,2011-04-01 13:25:00,2910,LOL... if you think that's real..... then maybe you need a break from work. Head out and do some fishing this weekend!
568194,NAW,2011-04-01 14:45:00,4022," Good idea.  70 hours last week, 60 this week.  I need a break.."
