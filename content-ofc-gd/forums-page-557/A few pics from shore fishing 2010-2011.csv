566812,manitoubass2,2011-03-28 12:54:00,11391," lol, I know, I've been meaning to post some forever, but just finally opened a photobucket account for the tourny.  It is amazing here, I love it. Head out in the boat twice a week, then fish the shore with the kids for the rest of the week. It's so nice to be able to just walk 10 minutes to go do some awesome fishing. Plus all the nature etc, the kids love it. It's almost like living up the lake"
566842,fishindevil,2011-03-28 15:14:00,6254,"some very nice fish for sure!!! too bad about those sturgeons,i have caught several that big out of the ottawa river,the people who did that are !@#$%&* you know what i mean thanks for sharing"
566963,manitoubass2,2011-03-28 21:48:00,11391,"I'm going out for the evening bite shortly, maybe I can get some more good pics???"
568193,manitoubass2,2011-04-01 14:43:00,11391,"Well, I've been out the past 2-3 days, and the bite wasn't hot, but patience won and we managed some decent walleye and some family fun. The weather was very nice for a week straight, sunny, warm and almost zero wind, not very ideal for fishing. So yesterday morning I was exited to wake up and see some clouds, some wind, and even some snow flurries.  I managed to land my biggest walleye thus far on soft water (from shore, too crappy out for the boat). But that will not last long, as the momma walleyes are heading in to spawn from LOTW and Rainy Lake!  Anyhow, a few pics  Bagged up and ready to go, two small walleyes    Yesterdays gear    Pretty gnarly conditions, snow/sleet, to the west    To the east    A buddys 22"" two days ago     My daughter stuck in a tree, lol    An upgrade for the OFC tourny  "

566379,manitoubass2,2011-03-27 04:15:00,11391," Thank you, and yeah, I know, that really bummed me out. We have so many here, but its important for them to be protected. I like catching them, don't get me wrong, but they MUST be released, and respected.  Here is a few more pics...  November 17th walleye, very cold fishing, lol    The ghetto ice fishing trip. No sleds, no power auger, no real sled, haha, nothig stops me from fishing when I have the itch to go    Right by our ice fishing shack, there is a hill. So I shoveled it off and packed it so the kids could slide if they got bored. I should also mention the 3 ft jump I built them! lol    All the kids came for some fun sliding while daddy fished    The shack    Good eaters like this, all day long. My god I love Rainy River!!!

566380,Twocoda,2011-03-27 04:26:00,4130,"livin the life man ....great report !   Your efforts are much appreciated but i tend to disagree with the ""easy 500 buck "" comment ...it would have ONLY been easy if the fish was caught on your very first cast of your very first fishing trip...its nice fishing gave you a bonus to all the quality time you have spent with your family...  Cheers and Nice Shootin to you ALL!!!!"
566390,Moosebunk,2011-03-27 10:15:00,3970,Great series of pics dood.  Nice part of the country you live in.  Those sturgeon pics P me off some.
566418,Rod Caster,2011-03-27 12:48:00,5784,I'm decided now...I'm going fishing today! Great series of photos man  What's up with the sturgeon? Unattended and tied up... I don't get it. Are they 100% c & r in you area?
566489,manitoubass2,2011-03-27 15:28:00,11391," Yes, they are 100% c&r here. I think what happened was someone was poaching, and they were either spooked off or they were taking a break??? Anyhow, me and the girlfriend walked to the rapids to take some nature pics/prego photos and we discovered them. So we cut hem loose and tried to revive them. It didnt work out so well, they were upside down in only a few inches of water, and it was out of the current, so the water was real warm and dirty. I got them all to swim away eventually, after like an hour of trying, but the next day 3 of them were washed up on shore. Such a bummer. They were all pretty good size too, they were all probably 40 years old"
566505,SlowPoke,2011-03-27 16:19:00,2984,"Great post, thanks for sharing!"
566506,scugpg,2011-03-27 16:21:00,1373,Wow I can't wait to get up there again! You sure do well up that way.  That's a shame about the Sturgeon though.
566507,Leecher,2011-03-27 16:24:00,7832,Man that's some beautiful walleyes    and from the shore too Sounds like Rainy river is the place to be to catch walleyes Thanks for sharing Leechman
566524,manitoubass2,2011-03-27 17:02:00,11391," Many thanks Leechman. I'll get around to posting some off shore pics soon as well. Yep, Rainy River is a great fishery, the walleye fishing has to be experienced to believe how good it actually is. It's great for smallmouth, sturgeon, pike and musky as well. If you come here targeting eyes though, its gotta be spring, fall or winter though, its not very good in the summer.  I'm heading out again today, I'll try and get some more good pics. It's -4, sunny and zero wind, perfect day for walleye fishing!!!"
566577,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-27 19:22:00,0,"nice eyes, but the sturgeons are a bummer.  i have a connection to sturgeon after netting, tagging, and tracking them for a few years as a fisheries student. the large sturgeons are typically the female and their eggs can net over 100 dollars an ounce, possibly more on the black market.  i've heard of local aboriginal groups harvesting them as well.  "
566582,Joey,2011-03-27 19:30:00,9122,"Great report and pics.  Some really nice pickerel there.  Too bad about the sturgeon, but at least you tried.  Whoever did that should be strung up and put in a few inches of standing water"
