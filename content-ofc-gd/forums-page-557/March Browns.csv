567557,strakey,2011-03-30 17:31:00,78,"Mike, i've noticed that your reports are becoming seasonal..................hhhhhhhhmmmmmmmm. Gotta love that word play, had to check Speil's link before i started banging my head on the wall. Should ov figured you'd put that in.  Nice catchin  andy"
567790,Harrison,2011-03-31 12:28:00,2202," Nice catch Spiel, I thought he was talking about the UPS parade.  Awesome Mike, as per usual.  Got one brown on a east tib last week, pleasent suprise."
567038,solopaddler,2011-03-29 00:22:00,8605,"Late March usually means steelhead but the particular river I fished on Sunday surprised me.  Large numbers of holdover browns, fully recovered and voraciously hungry gave us consistent action.  The water was extremely high with just a tinge of green, perfect really.  Slower water called for long slender floats, light tippets and small baits.  Twitching and rocking the float every so often made the small mostly white maribou jigs pulsate and triggered a lot of strikes.  Also very effective was a small bead run in tandem with a micro white roe bag.  The bead seems to attract the fish then they usually home in on the bag, or the finisher as I like to call it.           Looking forward to later this week when the temps get warmer!"
