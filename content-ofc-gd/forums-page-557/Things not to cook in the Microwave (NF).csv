567269,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-29 16:52:00,0,When Microwaves first came out.  We used to try all kinds of things to see what would happen. Amoung other items  One of the best was when my buddy put an egg in for 5 mins.   Nothing seemed to happen. I was walking out of the kitchen when he finally took the egg out. I heard a POP!. I walked back into the kitchen to see him frozen and about ready to scream. When he placed the egg on the counter it blew up! There was HOT egg fragments everywhere. I'm glad I didn't stay to watch. He said it hurt for a few seconds lol. It's unbelievable how much egg is in a shell and how it can cover an entire kitchen....
567296,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-29 19:06:00,1022," Shoulda seen my ""egg knuckle ball"" into people's windows when I was young and stupid"
567301,douG,2011-03-29 19:26:00,2693," Ok, I guess this one comes to me.  The inside of your microwave is made of metal because it reflects all that microwave energy into the food inside.  The electromagnetic energy is produced by a magnetron that is tuned to oscillate at 2.45 GHz, the natural frequency of oscillation of the water molecule.  You set up an environment with lots of bouncy energy, and the water inside of the stuff inside naturally bounces at the same rate, and by vibrating, heats up the stuff.   That's why you can't heat anything in a microwave that doesn't have water in it.  Also and as well, metal stuff inside can reflect that microwave energy in ways that don't work for the unit.  This can cause sparks and flares and other cool stuff.  Throw a CD inside for giggles and ships.  I hope this answered your question, O Small Furry One.  Feel free to ask again, I can make up all sorts of answers."
567684,camillj,2011-03-31 00:48:00,1988,Jeeze .. I didnt realize it was 2.4 ghz .. isnt that the same frequency we used to do a whole of of telephony and wireless data on ??? (still do)
566859,camillj,2011-03-28 16:37:00,1988,"Ok,  Under the topic of it is better to learn from other peoples mistakes ... I offer up the first in what I expect to be a long list of things NOT to cook in the microwave ...  1. Tuna Melts ... (tuna, cheese, celery on half english muffin) today I tried to re-heat one (1 minute) - result : small nuclear explosion   ... tuna ALL over the inside of the microwave .. why ??? ... not sure really  ... but it could have been the cheese acting as a steam block .. not willing to try again to watch and see  Please add your own (keep it tasteful)"
566860,cram,2011-03-28 16:44:00,1733,Egg without piercing the yolk....similar result.

566884,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-28 17:28:00,1022, learned this the hard way
566890,Roy,2011-03-28 17:50:00,13728,"If you take a minute to learn how a microwave works, you'll know what you can and what you cannot microwave. Aluminum foil or any metal should never be placed in a microwave, right?  Ok now riddle me this. How come the inside of your microwave oven is made of metal?"
566893,camillj,2011-03-28 18:05:00,1988, And how come they specifically tell you to put a little tinfoil on the ends of your drumstucks if you are (not that I ever would anyway) cooking trukey in a microwave.   Also ... my microwave cam with a rack (like the one in your oven) ... agian we never use it .. but it is definitely made of stainless steel (or nickel plated)
566897,Joey,2011-03-28 18:23:00,9122,"Many years ago, I bought a breakfast sandwich, I think it was Harvey's but can't remember.  It was in a bag and I just threw the bag in the micro at work and pressed reheat and went to my desk for a minute.  Next thing you know, the fire alarm is going off and the kitchen was filled with smoke.  The bag in the micro was in flames.  The Fire dep't came, it was quite embarassing.  The sandwich was wrapped in a thin tinfoil lined wrapper, then put in the paper bag.  Never did that again."
566902,vance,2011-03-28 18:29:00,719,"Stainless steel in the micro wave is ok,I don't know why but the waves don't cause sparking and it doesn't heat up.   vance"
566904,I'mHooked,2011-03-28 18:47:00,525,"Well I must say that in my ""younger"" years    I had been known to on a dare, at a seven-eleven, put an un-opened can of chilli in their microwave and leave the store.  Another interesting experiment is to put a burned out light bulb in a microwave and watch the element glowing as brightly as ever bouncing around the inside of the bulb. Fun light show.  Ah, youthful exuberance!"
566913,adempsey,2011-03-28 19:22:00,1498,"RO and distilled water.  No minerals in the water don't allow the bubbles to form, so the liquid superheats and when you first touch it there can be a violent reaction."

Thus sending your entire lunch on a new mission. The tuna was just along for the ride......  20 seconds would have been a lot better outcome !!!!!!"

567196,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-29 12:29:00,1022, I would hope so if you did that
