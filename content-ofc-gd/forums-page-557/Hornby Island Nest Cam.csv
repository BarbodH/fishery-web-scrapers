565722,Joey,2011-03-25 03:19:00,9122,"Cool, thanks for the link.  Read an interesting article today in The Star about the two eagles who live in Hamilton.   They are hoping the male is mature enough to mate and have his female companion produce an egg or two this year"

565846,ehg,2011-03-25 14:56:00,2666,Checked it out from time to time last year. Watched a bit from eggs until quite large but didn't see leaving the nest. Thanks for posting this.
567880,ehg,2011-03-31 17:03:00,2666,"http://www.hancockwildlife.org/index.php?topic=cam-sites  The website above has links to live streaming video cams of some Bald Eagles nests in B.C. Just egg sitting happening now. If you scroll down there is a live cam of hummingbird, it is quite active.  These Bald Eagles in Missouri are about a month ahead of B.C. They have been bringing fish and birds to the nests to feed babies.  http://www.hancockwildlife.org/index.php?topic=Ozarks#Ozark"
