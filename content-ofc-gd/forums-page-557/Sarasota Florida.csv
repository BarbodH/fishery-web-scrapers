Anyhoo, when I was in Sarasota, years ago albeit, there was a group charter operator out of there.  Not very pricey at all and a nice boat ride, but it's you and a pile of other fisherman, anchored bottom fishing.  I'm sure you'll be able to find the other types too though.  If you have time, a trip to look at the sharks at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota would be a nice way to spend a little time.  Bon voyage!"
