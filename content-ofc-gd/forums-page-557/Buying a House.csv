567808,Gregoire,2011-03-31 13:19:00,1397," Sorry not a 3 car garage. It is a one car garage with 3 parking spots. As far as the boat goes, it is probably on the back burner unfortunately, but the mortgage shuold be manageable, so I plan on putting money aside from the sale of the condo and from the fact that my payments on the house will be lower now that I have someone to help with them. I know that I am taking a serious risk RE the potential for me to ever get a boat, but I'm hoping that my fiance will stick to her word on this one."
567809,Gregoire,2011-03-31 13:25:00,1397,"Thanks for all the great advice guys. I really appreciate your input. Heading to do the home inspection today, and my real estate agent is paying for it as a gift. At least that is 400 bucks plus that I do not have to worry about. Just about the only advice thing I seem to be compramising on is giving up the boat. I'm pretty sure I can swing a fishing Kayak, which I'll be able to use in the Kawartha's and such. I'm hoping the fiscal restraint on my part and my guaranteed income increases will allow me to induldge in a few years....at least before we get a kid. From what I hear this is usually the deadline for when your disposable income disappears."
567813,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-31 13:43:00,1022,"Please do report back as to how thoroughly the ""home inspector"" looked at things. If he's at the house for 45min, kick him in the butt on his way out and be glad you didn't have to pay for his services."
567817,bigbuck,2011-03-31 13:53:00,2449,"Sit on top of the home inspector and ask tons of questions. Because he is there as 'a gift' from your agent, there is a fair chance that he will overlook things so the deal can happen. Things like Knob and tube wiring, asbestos, formaldehyde, mould and the like ARE BIG NO NO'S. Make sure you look closely at the windows, roof, plumbing, electrical, any spot where you can check for whatever insulation there is (not too much in those old houses, I lived at Pape and Mortimer as a kid). Make sure that whatever electrical work that can be seen would pass code. Take a good look at the garage too. Most of the points have been covered as to weekly payments (takes up to 4 years off amortization), RRSP Homebuyers Plan (you aren't using it and some of the info mentioned isn't completely accurate - you borrow up to $25k from your existing RRSP, not from the bank and it has to be paid back over 15 years with no tax break on the repayment that has to be on top of your regular contributions, that said, not always the best way to go), TFSA's (loving them for most people who have good work pensions) and RESPs for your future kids. Keep on on small reno jobs in the house, $2k a year is a pretty good number to work with, remember it's an average number, some years may be higher (bathroom reno's, kitchen, roof, windows, etc...). You have to keep up on it otherwise it will become a big number one day and the list will be very long and you will have difficulty selling the house when that time comes. If things have been kept up and the house looks decent, it's easier to get your money out. Good Luck!!!"
567824,torco,2011-03-31 14:20:00,656,"If you are planning to do floors or painting right after you move in, if possible try and get them done before. We found it so much easier to have someone come in and refinish the hardwood floors on our main floor before we moved in. Also gave most rooms a fresh coat of paint as well. Depends on closing dates and what not but if the opportunity presents itself take advantage."
567827,Gregoire,2011-03-31 14:25:00,1397," I've been told by my agent that the inspection will take at least 2 hours...in fact his direct quote was ""have something to eat before because we might be there a while."" I have worked with a few agents in the past, and trust my guy, not just because he is a good friend who I played football with, but also because he knows his stuff. I have heard some horror stories about agents and the way the treat clients, and I'm glad that is something I don't have to worry about. I have no doubt in my mind that if there were any problems with the house he would advise me to walk away from the deal."
567829,Gregoire,2011-03-31 14:27:00,1397," I'm going to try to push this with my finace, even it it means living at her sisters or mothers for a few weeks after closing. I think it is really good advice. Thanks"

567838,Flappn,2011-03-31 14:59:00,245,"Make sure the Price is right!! Here's my dad's perspective on home buying. A house is not an investment if you take into consideration property tax, maintenance blah blah blah over the time you own it. So you have to make sure up front your not over paying. His rule of thumb after reading a library of investment books and seeing this stated over and over is you should never pay more that 15 years of rent for a home. Meaning...find out what the rent would be if you where to rent and multiply it over 15 years. Easier way, take the rent amount of say $2000 per month and multiply it by 150 (there are 150 months in 15 years) = 300,000.00. If your paying more than the calculation your paying to much. This applies to any city or township in North America."
567846,Gregoire,2011-03-31 15:12:00,1397,"  Interesting view on home ownership.  I am pretty sure that we are not overpaying, but the home inspection will be able to shed some light on that issue. Similar houses in the area were going for 60k+ more than we are paying. I'm guessing that the lack of staging in the house, and the fact that there had not been a lot of work done on it recently explains part of it. The way I see it the wiring, plumbing and roof are all new. These are huge expenses and more valuable than new flooring or updated appliances. We saved a lot of money which will allow us to finish the house the way we want it, without having to invest in major fixes on the property."
568054,Gregoire,2011-04-01 01:00:00,1397,"I got the inspection done today. Everything checked out pretty well. There are a few small things that need to be done, but nothing major. The home inspector, Carl, was a nice dude, very personable and helpful. He did a great job. All I have to do now is pay the rest of the deposit and hope to maximize the price on my condo."
568083,pics,2011-04-01 03:21:00,1268,"A good home inspector will give you a video of everything he reported on AND a report in a binder...  Don't furnish it with the don't pay for a year furniture....those stores usually have poor quality offshore junk that breaks before you pay for it...If you're on a budget, save and pay cash. The credit cards should be empty for any emergencies the will come up(and they will)....  In five years when you renew and the home has more equity, your bank will bend over backwards to keep you as a customer. This is how you get your boat because the payments on the house should go down enough to get one.....unless you had a line of credit or a visa etc that the banks want you to throw on the renewal...don't do it! Never roll car payments etc into a renewal...your 10 000 car loan becomes much bigger in the long run...  If you aren't already one, become a handyman.....unless you have handy friends...this will save you the most $$$"
567673,Gregoire,2011-03-31 00:25:00,1397,"I'm finally tacking the next step towards being an adult and buying a house with my fiance. For the past 5 years I have been living in a condo downtown, but realized that if we are going to start a family, and live together without driving each other we need more space. After unsuccessfully looking in the burbs "";we"" decided (yes that is the executive we) that the commute to work would be too hard to manage. We decided on a place on the Danforth. It is a bungalow with 3 parking spots and a garage (for my future boat that I will not be able to afford any longer). The property needs a bit of work though, hopefully we can do a bunch ourselves and stick to a budget for the rest. Since this site is full of people with much more life experience than me, I'd like to ask if anyone has advice to pass along to me, in terms of what to expect with this move."
567691,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-31 00:57:00,2582,First of all congrats  It's a big step for everyone.  I'm no expert but the best advice I got was take  a 5 year term for your first ammortization period. Gives you 5 years to settle into your home and your new life and routines. Then when you renew....knock 5 years off your Amm. So if you start with a 25 year and sign a 5 year term you will be due for renewal at 20 years. At this point change your Amm to 15 years. You will NOT have a problem with the larger payments unless mortgage rates go crazy...but it will knock years and a lot of coin off your mortgage. Also I would recommend paying rapid weekly payments.  Another thing that I think is brilliant but I never did it because my house was brand new when I bought it was budget every year for some renovation. A work friend of mine has done this every since he bought his home 15 years ago. He budgets 2 grand a year...ballpark... for some home improvement...doesn't matter what it is..just budget for it...and you will always keep your home up to snuff. We never did that and now 22years later EVERYTHING needs updated or fixed  Debbe has the MOTHER  of all honeydew lists made up for me and I could keep myself busy for the next 5 years with it.  Whatever you do.... enjoy your home and again congratulations.
567695,mercman,2011-03-31 01:17:00,7054,"Congrats !!!! Pay your mortgage weekly of bi-weekly.Figure it out, you will save literally thousands over the course of your mortgage.Plus, its easier to budget on a weekly basis.It all depends on your pay schedule however.Weekly or bi-weekly. Most of all, enjoy your investment"
567698,Terry,2011-03-31 01:22:00,14456,you are about to enter into the biggest financial obligation of your life     not the house    but the women   a house you can pay off and still own it and use it    once you pay the women off..it means they can't take you any more. and they move on.......         just kidding
567699,Gregoire,2011-03-31 01:27:00,1397,"Planning on doing weekly payments. Also going to do some renos soon after buying. Not sure if they are going to be immediate or not, as the house is livable and I've been told that you should live in your house for a bit to decide what you want to do. That part about 2 grand a year for reno budget is great advice, especially since this is our first house and we will probably be upgrading in 5-10 years. Keeping the house up to date means that we won't have to upgrade it when selling."
567701,Pikeslayer,2011-03-31 01:30:00,1443,"Never, ever, never under any circumstances ever forego a home inspection. Never, never,ever!  Did I say never?  Slayer"
567707,Banger68,2011-03-31 01:47:00,157,Do not over extend yourself. Try and keep a comfortable budget. If it's too tight it makes ownership miserable. Be honest with yourself.
567709,jjcanoe,2011-03-31 01:51:00,744,all of the above AND (most importantly) get the boat first!
567715,cowanjo,2011-03-31 02:01:00,249," This has some great points - pay biweekly on day you get paid. Dont use the mortage ever to buy consumer goods - take a portioned fixed as rates are at a historical low level and residual variable enough so you can smash it down.  The second part is tough for me - 2K a year good plan but really any good, i am against this - as after 5 years it is a dated reno anyway and a poor investment in a great deal of cases too many people invest in their properies and would have made it regardless as markets change. If you took the opposite view and put in RRSP at 5% the 2K a year inclusive or reinvesting tax return and compound would be worth a significant chunck. IE Year 1 invest 2K for 22 years at 5% is almost6K Not sure better off doing zero getting lessor gain - or spending 60K now probably the later means all new vs dated?"
567716,cowanjo,2011-03-31 02:08:00,249,Sorry i also missed a step if you are really going to upgrade in 5-10 years why not save the 2K a year and rent out the property after ten years - use any capital appreciation plus mortgage paydown to use as deposit on next place. Dont over extend but you could end up with a nice income stream and properties that you could live in (Too many investors buy property they would never live in which is a massive mistake)> If you think this way you wont do dumb renos which never get a return

567730,danc,2011-03-31 02:45:00,4677,"Shop around for a good rate. Tell company A that company B offered you a better rate. Then tell company B that company A beat them. Then go back to company B. I did this many times when I had a mortgage and managed to save over 1% of the going rate. Also, never pay a mortgage renewal fee. It`s as simple as telling them that you`re moving elsewhere. Congrats and good luck."
567734,irishfield,2011-03-31 02:52:00,26272,You won't get away with parking the boat outside most likely. By-law restriction and anything bolted down will be stolen.  House.. $ based on one wage earner or you're fooling yourself.

If need be I could carry the cost of the home on my income, hopefully this will never be the case. The house has a garage. If the wife will let me this is where the boat will go. Until then I am planning on getting a kayak for the summer. Canadian tire has a decent one for a decent price."
567757,dhickey,2011-03-31 03:44:00,1038,house inspection is a must. i have done lots of renos and just shake my head with what people get themselves into with their best intensions in mind.  weekly morgage payments are the best way to go. you will get to a piont where you dont even think about it.  secure a credit line in order to carry you through unexpected expences or rainy days.  dont listen to your bank.(they are in the buisnes of taking your money)  buy your boat now.   most importantly dont forget about the futer ie. children infants are wonderfull but do cost allot of money in the first 3 yrs.  most of all dont become a slave to your debts(it sucks)  its a big jump no doubt about that.  good luck and best wishes for the future.  congrats   saltydawg

I do not go the RRSP route for a variety of reasons, mostly because I am in line for a large pension and feel that a TFSA is a better route. It was a personal choice based on the tax bracket I am likely to be in when I retire."

I also pay my mortgage at a higher rate then I'm actually being charged.  This takes a nice chunk out of the principle everytime I make a payment.   Gotta remember, you pay the interest first"
567764,dhickey,2011-03-31 03:56:00,1038,re . house inpectoin  always always always use your own inspector or at least one that your bank sudjest .  never the realestate brokers inspector.   (money talks there/ get the drift)

567804,Fish4Eyes,2011-03-31 13:10:00,1022,"Don't get a home inspection. Majority of these ""inspectors"" completed a weekend course to become a ""home inspector"". Use common sense and ispect every square inch of the home inside and out very carefully. My real estate agent told me I was one of a kind and at times insane as I did exactly what I am recommending for you to do  . Word of advice, don't bring your wife with you if you do decide to inspect the house by yourself as she will get impatient and rush you. If you really want a home inspection, you would be better off paying an experienced contractor who renovates to have a look and give you his opinion.  Things to look into:  -how old are the windows? -when was the roof last done? If the shingles are curling at the corners, its time soon. -how old are the AC/furnace? -has the basement ever flooded? Check the grading around the house to ensure water is not pooling towards the foundation. -Does the foundation have cracks in it? If the house is brick, fix any cracks in the grout/brick asap. -does the house have knob and tube wiring (as you mentioned it is older). Is it copper wiring? -does the house have copper plumbing? -make sure the basement does not smell mouldy. -if the basement has lift ceilings, have a look at the wiring to see if there are junction boxes. If there is, it is usually safe to assume the wiring was butched throughout the whole house. -look for mold in the attic -does the house have return air ducts on every floor?  If you need a good mortgage rate, I can give you a contact. I got 3.69% 5year fixed in May 2010. Others offered 4%+ at the time. Might be worth it for you to talk to the guy and shop around and compare. PM if you need a contact.  Hope this helps bud!"
