""Roger Abbott was, quite simply, at the very heart of the CBC family,"" said Kirstine Stewart, CBC's Executive Vice-President of English Services, in a statement on Sunday. ""As one of the founders of Royal Canadian Air Farce, first on radio, then on television, he was, to generations of fans, among the best-known and loved in the history of Canadian comedy. I would extend on behalf of CBC our deepest condolences to his family and friends.""  Roger died Saturday night at Toronto General Hospital, 14 years after being diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He was 64.  Many people have asked what they can do to remember Roger. His favorite charity was Easter Seals Ontario. He was devoted to helping children with physical disabilities and was a passionate supporter, with his time and money, for more than 30 years. Donations can be made to Easter Seals Ontario in his name at http://www.easterseals.org. Roger would thank you!  -- In loving memory of Roger, from Don and everbody at Air Farce."
