566509,Drock6687,2011-03-27 16:26:00,90,Has anyone ever fished mill creek just outside cambridge?  my uncle said he just to fish there 20 years a go when he was a kid and there was a fair amount of brown trout in there but hes not sure if they are still there sicne Nestle opened their water bottling plant.  I was out there the other day and it looked promising but still have 33 days to go till i can find out for sure...any insite would be helpful

566565,johnl,2011-03-27 18:57:00,197,there isn't very many trout in there anymore

566740,Drock6687,2011-03-28 02:06:00,90,Thanks for the info...its really disapointing since I was hoping that i had a new trout creek closer to home!

567284,Stern Rules,2011-03-29 18:10:00,342,I guess I'll have to start checking out some places. I might get lucky. I didn't think we had a lot of brookie spots here.
