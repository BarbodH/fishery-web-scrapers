Not used to seeing ""higher end"" rods at Wally world so I checked them out. They had the 6' and 6.6' Shimano Compre spinning rods and the 6.6' Compre bait casting rods. I am sure there are better prices for the Compre but was surprise to see them there with all the other $20 - $80 rods."

568035,Rizzo,2011-04-01 00:09:00,4754,if you find a 8'(or longer) musky rod for 119.00 let me know!
568104,sauce,2011-04-01 06:12:00,219,"119 sounds about right for the rods you mentioned. I bought a 6'6 baitcast at BPS for 129 a few weeks ago. Not sure if its still happening now but shimano is offering a $20 rebate on all compres. Check their website for details, a compre for $99 is a good deal"
