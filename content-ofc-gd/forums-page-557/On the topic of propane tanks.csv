567859,kickingfrog,2011-03-31 16:14:00,8333,In Barrie Costco was the cheapest place by far to refill a propane bbq tank. I was told they don't have the refill facility any more.  What is my next cheapest option to refill a tank in Barrie???
567860,ckrb2007,2011-03-31 16:19:00,449,I get mine done at the canadian tire gas station on Mapleview....probably not the cheapest ($18) but at least I can check out the tackle when I'm done. lol
567861,Pikeslayer,2011-03-31 16:24:00,1443,Beware of independant operators/refill stations. It is not uncommon to short fill tanks. The indepenpant gas station on Queen St N/Mississauga Rd. in Streetsville (Mississauga) fill only to 12-14 lbs (I have weighed them) and totally rip off their customers. I 'spread the word' as often as I can.  Feel free to pass it on!  Slayer

567913,Roy,2011-03-31 18:24:00,13728,$11.99 here at Costco but that might be a little far for most members.
567915,kickingfrog,2011-03-31 18:37:00,8333,Costco in Barrie doesn't sell propane anymore.
567927,skeeter,2011-03-31 19:04:00,1907, Absolutely wrong !!!!!!! Costco refills all propane tanks!!!! Here in the gta it is $14.11 including tax for a 20 LB.
