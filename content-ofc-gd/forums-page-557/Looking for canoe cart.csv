That's 3.5 hour drive and 11.5 hours paddling and portaging. We have 1 portage that is 5 klms long and it's fairly smooth and flat. If we could do this in one trip, we could cut another 2 hours off our total time. Does anyone know where I can get a durable cart to pull a loaded canoe through the bush? Some where in the Toronto area? I've found a few places to order them (U.S) but would really like to go check them out rather than order on-line. I do about 4 portage trips a year and a cart would help when I'm wife the wifey also. Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks"

563456,otter649,2011-03-19 21:31:00,118,I believe Fendock out of Ottawa has a canoe cart that they sell through agents through out Canada & will be at The Cottage Life Show at the end of March in Toronto & usually have a few for sale at the show but not sure about pricing - Check out their web site.......

563592,chris.brock,2011-03-20 03:11:00,4053,"I think I know what lake you like from your trip description. If you download movies, check out ""Borealis"", a great movie for Ontario canoe trippers, and what cart not to buy"
563666,trevy727,2011-03-20 14:24:00,351, There's no way you know what lake I go to. P.M me a let me know what you think. I'll tell you if you're right.

567247,torco,2011-03-29 15:52:00,656,I don't know a 5km fairly flat and smooth portage. I am sure if he has an intimate knowledge of the park he could likely get it down to a few lakes.  The real question is the fishing worth it? They keep going back so it must be!  I would love to see a report when you get back. Its been a few years since I have done a spring fishing trip in Algonquin.
567254,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-29 16:14:00,0,build one yourself.  carry a spare tire and a pump.
567257,troutologist,2011-03-29 16:23:00,951," Nope get non-pneumatic tires. Foam or solid rubber...talking to those old guys pulling the carts for a number of years they had found what didn't work the best.  They also rigged solid handles to come out in front of the canoe, so 2 people could pull standing up leaning into the bar."
567265,solopaddler,2011-03-29 16:42:00,8605,  I cut a piece of pvc pipe and tie it to the bow of the canoe making a yoke for two guys.  That's definitely the only way to do it.
567273,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-29 17:19:00,0, i have my handles rigged to the bow rickshaw style.  airless tires?  those are kind of hard to find in junk piles!   
567297,Rustic-Fisher,2011-03-29 19:15:00,826,"If its a 5km or a 5.7km    portage, just look at all the broken and busted up carts left in the bush along the portage route.....lol tell ya what not to buy or how not to build it ! I own the unit Solopaddler recommended and can give it the thumbs up! well worth the money in the long run."
567315,Oggie,2011-03-29 20:04:00,588,It's too bad it couldn't be used to haul a deer out of the bush as well. Might be work it if the cart could do several jobs.  Dan O.

567668,zdan,2011-03-31 00:17:00,9,"I too tackled this problem a few years ago. After looking on the internet for heavy duty canoe carts the selection was limited and the prices high. I found this guy in Ontario that was making these killer carts, 450 lbs capacity, except thay were going for $ 650.00 After thinking about the problem I decided to build my own. Get a couple of used 24"" mountain bike frames, cut off everything ahead of the seat post off, weld the two together and bingo, you got yourself a killer canoe cart. I built mine with 20"" frames and this thing can haul 550 lbs no problem and go anywhere. if I have time tomorrow I will dig mine out and post pics. You should be able to build it for less the $ 100.00  The beauty of this design is that the canoe will be at a comfortable height."
