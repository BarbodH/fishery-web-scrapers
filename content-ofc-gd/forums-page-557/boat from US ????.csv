567840,zman,2011-03-31 15:02:00,179,Why do you need seperate bills of sales for the boat motor and trailer do you pay duty on the motor ?
567844,Pikeslayer,2011-03-31 15:11:00,1443,"Ummmmm.... that's actually 2 questions.  Sorry Zman, I had to beat Roy and Skeeter to that one. Not sure, but I think you're gonna get taxed/dinged by MTO @ some point on the trailer?  Slayer"
567849,superdad,2011-03-31 15:26:00,353,"You need separate bills of sale, as the Border will charge GST & PST on the boat, thwy will charge GST on the trailer and when you register the trailer, the MOT will charge PST on the trailer.  No big deal.  David  aka  Superdad"
567874,zman,2011-03-31 16:53:00,179,"Ok with that being said do you pay tax on the motor ?  or just on the boat , I will have 3 bills of sale one for each  Thanks for the help"
567878,Rae,2011-03-31 17:00:00,21,"I only had two ""bills of sale"" one that included both the boat and motor and the second for just the trailer. In the end you pay tax on everything...  Rae"
567899,lowerunit,2011-03-31 18:00:00,53,Hey Zman you pay two taxes one on the boat and motor and one for the trailer.
567952,skeeter,2011-03-31 19:40:00,1907,"There is different rates on duties on each item. If it is all on 1 bill of sale then you pay the highest dutie rate for the entire bill of sale. Also take 2 other people with you when you pick up the boat. Each person is allowed a dutie free allowance. When i brought my boat up from florida it was $300.oo per person. The boat was sold to me, the trailer was sold to my wife, and the motor was sold to my daughter. That was $900.oo that I didnt have to pay dutie and taxes on !!!"
567972,bpsbassman,2011-03-31 20:50:00,941,You should also get the titles for all 3 items that show that they are clear.  They won't let you over without them.
568103,Henricus,2011-04-01 05:40:00,118,"no duty on boats built in u.s., just taxes"
