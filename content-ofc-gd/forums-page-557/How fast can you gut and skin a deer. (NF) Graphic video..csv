567483,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-30 09:47:00,2582,Not a hunter myself...but I still enjoy watching a pro at work. I wonder how many he has done to get that good?
567494,oldphart,2011-03-30 12:35:00,665,"~~~Okay time to go shopping some Garlic, Onions, Sage, Pepper corn, Tomatoes, have I forgotten anything, Great Vid. Wonder how fast he can be out of season with MNR closing in."
567497,Pikeslayer,2011-03-30 12:46:00,1443,"Impressive, but....... That's obviously a 'southern' deer. Not much bigger than an adult goat + very thin hide."
567536,Big Cliff,2011-03-30 15:32:00,6899,"He's not that good! he only beat me by about 17 minutes and 3 seconds  Actually learned a lot from that though, next time I'll use a knife"
567538,Abberz,2011-03-30 15:35:00,140,Pretty impressive. Looked like a medium size dog though. I'm sure he could post a similar time with a much larger deer however LOL.  Might have to review his technique for next fall.
567596,mercman,2011-03-30 20:06:00,7054,"  if you can skin and clean a deer in 20 mins with your bare hands Cliff, you are my hero !!!"
567613,misfish,2011-03-30 21:00:00,29133," Yeah,my thoughts exactly. Cripes I drag that one a mile or two, whole.  Impressive knife work though."
