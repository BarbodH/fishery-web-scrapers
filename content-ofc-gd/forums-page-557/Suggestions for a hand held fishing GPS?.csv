567947,Nipfisher,2011-03-31 19:25:00,2449,Stay away from Magellan. They become outdated very fast. Go with a Lowrance I-finder with colour screen (holds the map chips) or the Garmin.

567955,camillj,2011-03-31 19:58:00,1988,I love my Lowrance H2Oc .. but I am not sure if you can get them on the retail market any more... I put a 1 gig chip and loaded up the Maps from the Topo maps (all of Ontario and most of quebec) - excellent unit .. batteries last all day (I always carry a few spares just in case) and seems to get pretty good coverage even in some pretty way-out terrain.

568157,motion,2011-04-01 13:04:00,403, Ditto for me. I found one on ebay for $80.00. Used it with my hotmaps from the boat unit and worked it on the ice all season. Love it!
568158,ld17,2011-04-01 13:09:00,319, excellent point.  That's why I went with the H20 expedition.  Compatible with my unit for boat.  Been using it for 3 years no problems.
