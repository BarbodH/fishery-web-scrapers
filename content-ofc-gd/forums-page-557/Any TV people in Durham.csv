567742,GBW,2011-03-31 03:04:00,8460,Hey all.  Is there anyone out in the Durham are who fixes TV's?  In my wife's daycare (home daycare) the TV would not turn on today.  It powers up and shuts right off.  So if anyone can help that would be great!  It's an older rear projection but a fix I bet will cost less then a new TV for the daycare kids to watch.  Cheers and thanks!  Geoff

Now you have gone and broke her tv. What else have you done, that we dont know about? Whats next? If you forget to pick her up at the airport, oh boy, i would love to be a fly on the wall that day!!!!!!!   YOU ARE SOOOOO DEAD WHEN SHE GETS HOME !!!!!!  Been nice fishing and knowing you Geoff. Any last requests!!!!!"
