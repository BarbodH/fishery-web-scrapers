I start fishing steelhead last fall with my 13ft rod and I saw most of the fishermen in the river was using fly reel and I was a lil jealous because I dont own one... so I told myself in spring I would buy one and learn it.. Anyway to make a story short I was at lebaron 3weeks ago and saw a pflueger trion, the way I look at it looks decent and its cheap compare to what you guys owned..  My question is, is this a good fly reel for steelhead for that price?? I have no idea what so ever what to look for, hows the drag, smoothness.. things I need to know...  what type of line I need to used? Is it okay to used my 13ft shimano converge rod for this type of reel or I need to buy one...  my budget is only 350... for everything... thats the only I can afford right now...  any help I would appreciated...  you can pm me if you dont feel like putting it here...  thnx bfisher"
