567694,MSBruno,2011-03-31 01:15:00,369,"Anyone find senkos just fall over/down and not sit up due to the weight/density of senko's?  Thanks in advance, Mark"
567702,Gregoire,2011-03-31 01:31:00,1397,Never had that problem. How are you hooking them and what type of hooks and line are you using?
567723,Drew_10,2011-03-31 02:24:00,111,"You could try using a senko (stick-worm) that has less salt.  Gary Yammamoto 'senkos' have way more salt thnn some of the other brands out there, and thus they are heavier."
567744,GBW,2011-03-31 03:07:00,8460,YUM brand ones work great!
567778,singingdog,2011-03-31 11:14:00,1047,"Yes, IF what you want is a stand-up presentation that can be worked fairly slowly, a lighter more buoyant worm will work better. Try the pro senko or the YUM finesse worm.  I find senkos on light jigheads deadly around timber and along deep weedlines: the jighead gives the senko a spiral fall that is just the ticket some days."
567800,MSBruno,2011-03-31 12:53:00,369, It's a new technique for me and I wish to try and I use senkos for wacky rigging.  I waswondering if I could use the same senkos.  They will be paired up with the MegaStrike Shakey Head hooks:  http://www.megastrikefishingproducts.com/shop/pro-series-shakey-heads/  Mark
567801,MSBruno,2011-03-31 12:54:00,369," This is the whole basis to my post, not sure if they'll give me the right action and if I should or will have better action with floating tails or less-salt, finesse worms."
567812,adempsey,2011-03-31 13:35:00,1498,"They aren't really designed for it, but why not just try it?  What size are you using?  The 3"" ones might be a better choice, but I don't see why you couldn't do it with a 4"" Senko.  You might just have to impart a bit more action in it.  It's a finesse technique, so the plastics designed for this type of fishing are probably more appropriate.   It doesn't mean that a Senko won't work.  Heck, it might even work amazingly well.  I use the Yum, Zoom and Yamamoto finesse baits for this myself."
568118,singingdog,2011-04-01 10:51:00,1047,Don't limit yourself to stick baits and worms. The Yum speed craw is killer on a shakey head.
