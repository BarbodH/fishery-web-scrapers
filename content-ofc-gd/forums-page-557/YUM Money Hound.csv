I have used 2/0-5/0 Extra Wide Gap Gamakatsu hooks on them and find the 3/0 suits them best  (4"") size.   but it seems like 2-3 fish or 2-3 hooking attempts and they are ripped down the centre and need to be flipped and used upside down. but once they rip open the inner material takes on water and the action goes for a dump.   i think you should try them as they do work well and regardless of the cost of using them i have a dozen at a time in my arsenal and one is always rigged on one of my rods in a tourney."
