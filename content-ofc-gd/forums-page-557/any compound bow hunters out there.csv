567445,Skud,2011-03-30 01:57:00,739,Bowtech has a great beginners bow (Soldier) and Diamond (by Bowtech) has two different beginners Bows. Nuclear Ice for little kids and Razors Edge for young teens.  Wolf's Den west of Barrie always has all three in stock if you want to check them out.  I bought my daughter the PSE Chaos because it came in pink and was on sale at Gagnons.  All those little bows are pretty damn quick.  I have the Bowtech Allegiance.
567456,dhickey,2011-03-30 02:38:00,1038,price piont is the objective here.  i have looked but not willing to spend 250-350  just to see if they like it or not. 150-200 tops. they are just kids if they like it they will move on to better equipment. i cant seem to find any thing in this class?   saltydawg.  any sudjestions welcome pls.
567462,richyb,2011-03-30 02:53:00,774,check out ebay. theres lots on there for cheap.
567553,Skud,2011-03-30 17:06:00,739,"It will be tough to find a good one for that price, even used.  Buying a bow and then all the accessories adds up fast.  Wolfs Den does usually have used ones for beginners from trade-ins. Just give them a call for stock and prices. They will tell you straight up over the phone."
