On the positive side rather than settling we've managed to bring in some more elite Canadian talent!  Welcome to the BASS PRO SHOP BASS TALK Lineup FISH TV  co-host, Ron James and the""ICEMAN"" himself Simon Frost! The complete line-up with topics will be available on our website shortly!  Also there will be some additional fabulous draw prizes for all attendees donated by the Bass Pro Shop in Vaughan Mills! Get those registrations in ASAP as this MAIN EVENT is less than 2 weeks away  Thank You, Dave Chong"
