28529,Headhunter,2007-01-30 15:03:00,5703,"In reading a number of the threads about perchin on Simcoe, I've noticed that many folks use live bait, specifically minnows. I've hardly ever used live bait, including minnows when I do get a chance to get out. Given the challenges we are now facing with minnows (buffer zone) and the price they are asking for minnows, I'm just wondering if anyone is considering going completely artificial this year? I've found that a jiggin Rap, tipped with power maggots/grubs works as well or better than minnows on most days, not to mention the PITA it can be transporting, re-hooking etc... that minnows can be. Any thoughts? HH"
28533,Guest gbfisher,2007-01-30 15:11:00,0,"I don't use live bait for Perch,whitefish or Lakers on Simcoe. You just don't need it. Minnows can be transported where ever YOU want. It is the harvesters who can't transport them around. It is your conscience that SHOULD stop you from doing it as well. There is NO LAW against it though."
28534,misfish,2007-01-30 15:15:00,29133,"I have yet to try them,but I have a bag of those shrimp baits.I would sooner use them and a tube instead of getting my hands wet and cold."
28535,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-30 15:17:00,0,"HH, although we didn't have a lot of success this past weekend, the jiggin raps caught more fish than the minnows.  Next time, I may not even bother buying minnows, saves the hands from getting cold as well."
28548,tonyb,2007-01-30 15:55:00,1637," I agree with not needing minnows for Perch, but I think it is a good idea to have one line set on your second rod/tip-up with a minnow near bottom for Lakers and Whitefish while you jig with a spoon or other artifical.  With Perch, hopefully the action is steady enough that you are able to only use 1 rod.  Jigging raps, Williams ice jigs and soft plastics work wonders for Perch."
28549,Terry,2007-01-30 15:56:00,14456,if you are an ice fisherman you don't need live bait....but if you're not much of a ice jigging person then minnows level the playing field....IMHO
28550,mattyk,2007-01-30 16:01:00,2110,what exactly is the buffer zone? Is this a new fishing regulation? I am not a really a live bait person so im unfamliar with this rule.
28554,misfish,2007-01-30 16:12:00,29133,  All you need is jigs.Check them out on E-Bay.
28555,Weeds,2007-01-30 16:12:00,782,"I think live bait is tough to beat. Sure, if you're an experienced ice fisherman you might master some kind of  jigging technique but even then you've only going to be working one rod. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I think an artificial keeps you more focussed on what you're doing and minnows let you sit back a little more. I guess both have their advantages."
28561,Headhunter,2007-01-30 16:25:00,5703,"I should have mentioned that when I'm perchin, I'm a run and gun kinda guy. Draggin minnows and all that they entail, around with me is just way too much work, not to mention the cold hands, freezing bait bucket etc... . ALso, feeding perch minnows simply gets on my nerves after a while. Sitting and waiting for a school to come to me, is something I wouldn't do in open water, why would I do it on ice? It's been my experience, that if the perch are there, they'll hit an artificial. Obviously, if they aren't they won't. That's why I ususally keep moving and drilling. Once a hole goes dry, I either drill a new one, or back track to my earlier holes, in case the school has moved there. A hole only get's about 30 seconds of my time, if it's not producing. HH"
28565,tonyb,2007-01-30 16:36:00,1637,"Exactly HH!  If they don't hit it within the first little bit, they just aren't there, and if they are why do you want to spend the time trying to trigger a fish in a negative mood.  There are always active fish somewhere!  Tony"
28568,FishFinder,2007-01-30 16:46:00,481,I dont jig or use live bait and still get over my limit of perch. I just tip a jig with a berkley powerbait maggot and suspend it slightly above bottom with a float. You will also see more strikes the float is so sensetive. Works for me...
28572,Zib,2007-01-30 16:59:00,369,"If you are going to be fishing in Cook's Bay you can get minnows on the ice at the end of Gilford Road. Look for a green & white shack that says ""BAIT"" on the side. A guy named Peter sells them for $4 a scoop (approx 48 minnows)."
28575,cityfisher,2007-01-30 17:06:00,959,they are not required but id recommend it....couple guys around us were using plastics and maggets and we out produced them all with some liveily minnows... the jumbos liked them on saturday
28603,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-30 18:06:00,1351,my jig and tube outproduced my waxworms in some holes and it was vise versa at others.
28695,Jef,2007-01-30 22:22:00,1,On the weekend it was Berkley Gulp minnows and Jiggin' Raps for me. So much action no time to drink the beer!
28862,Skud,2007-01-31 04:25:00,739,Good to see you back Cupcake.
