They took us out to our bungalows in their ""Magic Bus"" and as we unpacked, the perch were already on our lines, not mine, but others in our group.  The bungalows were clean, comfy and warm.  This is my second time with this outfitter and I am extremely impressed so far.  The afternoon on Day 1 was fairly slow, but blue sky days and day 2 of a cold front werent exactly the best fishing conditions.  We ended up with a couple herring and a whole bunch of perch.  By about 11:00pm, we were all a little bit tipsy, but steady enough to grab that bouncing tip-up, Dave landed a nice whitie and we cooked it up immediately.   Dave with a nice whitie.  I woke up at first light and dropped a line down, the fish were biting and I was pumped.  Tyler, Derek and I landed a couple dozen herring and about 30 or 40 perch.  Mostly on maggots, but some on minnows and small spoons.  Today was much better than yesterday!   Tyler with a nice perch.  Me with our huts keepers for the day.  We fished a bit on Sunday and landed some more herring and perch.  Tyler lost a big whitie on Sat night, but nothing we could do.  I highly recommend these guys and I suggest you give them a try, I'm headed back up in a month, and I will post again."

28305,steverowbotham,2007-01-30 00:10:00,1800,"Disspatcher, I was still up fishin, but I was in a different hut.  Davey drank a whole lot o' booze on Saturday and was out for the count pretty quickly.  I'm down for a MoeZ or Fanny's trip next season haha."
28308,fishindevil,2007-01-30 00:15:00,6254,great report guys ...looks like you had an awsome time and caught alot of fish and had a good meal..nice pics as well
28422,joonmoon,2007-01-30 04:54:00,528,Good work and some beauty fish there. I didn't see any eyes did ya git any? or Pike?
28433,steverowbotham,2007-01-30 05:39:00,1800,"no eyes, no pike. Right now, with unsafe ice on their usual spot, we're put onto a perch/herring spot so lots of fish are still being caught, some eyes around on the Aquaview, but  not biting.  Another week or so maybe and they'll be on the 'eye spot."
28577,Disspatcher,2007-01-30 17:10:00,73,"We did find 1 3lb pike but no eyes! Steve, when we came over for MoeZ tour, we did find one lone fisherman....40pouder 1/2 mt in one hand, ice rod in the other. The action on the end of the rod must have been killer cause it was quite the effort to keep himself steady as it was!!! Great Weekend!  Moe Z Girls Rock!!"
28593,steverowbotham,2007-01-30 17:44:00,1800,"haha that was matt, i never saw him sober for the whole trip haha.  he drank a 24, a 26er and half a 60 pounder.  he was mangled to say the least."
