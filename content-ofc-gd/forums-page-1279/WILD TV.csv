28023,Smokey,2007-01-29 14:03:00,1278,I know that Rogers in Toronto does not carry it. They do carry videos on demand but you have to pay to watch them and there's only a couple to choose from that have been on the list forever. So your probably out of luck. Go back to expressvu.

28413,DMASSE,2007-01-30 04:19:00,420,"wELL WFN is great i agree, but there are shows on WILD TV that they do not show.   I also like the hunting side of the great outdoors....  Rogers said in the next couple week, they should be adding it to the package..  dave"
