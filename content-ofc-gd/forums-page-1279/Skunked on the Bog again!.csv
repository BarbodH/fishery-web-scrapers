Find some nice green weeds and your all set.  Hard to find a real edge to the weeds, its more like pockets with no weeds. That's where ya wanna be at sunrise/set.  The deepest part of the lake is out from cesarea....bout 22 FOW. There is a deep hole on the west side of the lake as well.....goes to about 15 or so ft. I've never fished either spot tho.........  End of the island, Goreskis, and out from West shore marina are my usual haunts......they're all about the same really........you just have to be there at the right time!  Sinker"

28212,kemper,2007-01-29 20:31:00,2232,"  Ill let you in on a little secret. The whole damn lake is 2-5 feet deep. People do well on Scugog, but you really have to know the lake well and find the spots (few) that arent 6 inches deep. lol"
28214,urbanangler1990,2007-01-29 20:36:00,933," yea i know that its pretty shallow, and its man made, there are depths of 20 feet i think... just cant find them yet, lol..."
