28074,knotaclue,2007-01-29 15:48:00,136,I need a new ice fishing minnow bucket. My old cooler and cheap aerator finally bit the farm on Sunday. So itâ€™s time to go shopping!!!! Anybody use something exceptional or is there something I should stay away from. I just want this for winter only. Thanks in advance...
