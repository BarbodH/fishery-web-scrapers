28081,Joey,2007-01-29 15:57:00,9122,"Holy Moly, that is a beauty crappie.  Well done.  Joey"
28085,Terry,2007-01-29 16:03:00,14456,nice looking crappie and it would be even nicer if you gave a little story on how you caught it ...just a few details....lol
28134,Fisherman,2007-01-29 18:05:00,7201,"There I wuz justa fishin on the ize, when all of a zudden, zing goes the drag, darn another boogger rocket, nooooo, it's a honkin crappie. A little bit of seesawing and fling...outa the hole he comes,  near landed right in my sleighbox.  Wasn't on Simcoe, or the river that comes in the south end.  I was sworn to secrecy or the other guy will stab me with a rusty fillet knife."
28137,Terry,2007-01-29 18:08:00,14456,so you were fishing for pike and the crappie was a bonus fish....was it the only crappie you caught did you catch lots of pike..details are everthing around here..well pictures help too.....lol
28202,Fisherman,2007-01-29 20:05:00,7201,"Actually, it was the only crappie, 3 booger rockets, but the intent was to go and get a couple of perch just for a fishwich at lunch.  I might try Gilford area tomorrow if it's not too blustery out."
28205,Terry,2007-01-29 20:11:00,14456,"thanks for the report good luck at gilford.... there are tons of perch at gilford, as my camera showed, but type of bait/lure, size and color and action really makes a difference..if you aren't catching change baits often....."
28302,RsX,2007-01-30 00:07:00,48,did u catch the crappie icing it??
28341,Fisherman,2007-01-30 01:20:00,7201,Icing it? yes ice fishing
28427,kennyman,2007-01-30 05:04:00,737,Nice fish. I bet that'll be yummy. My Grandfather used to give us a big bag of crappie fillets every once in a while and I swear they were the best. Then I had some at my Dads and he makes this sweet tasting batter ........ best fish I ever had!
