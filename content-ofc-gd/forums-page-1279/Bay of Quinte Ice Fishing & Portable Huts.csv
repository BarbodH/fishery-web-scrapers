We have a huge supply of minnows on hand mostly mud minnows and shiners mixed in with them. Our price is 5.00 per scoop and you will get over 2 dozen in a scoop. We have the best prices in the area and we do have quite a large supply of minnows.  I am also setting up Frabill and Clam portable huts that I will rent out on a daily basis for those that are interested in coming up and would like to have a shelter to fish out of in case you are bringing young ones with you and you might want to keep them out of the wind and cold etc.  I will be out fishing this Saturday morning with a crew that is coming out from Hamilton and we will post the results as well as pics.  Click on the link for a map to our store, and we can be contacted at (613) 966-0020.  Carra Outdoor Sports Map  Remember to be safe and have fun.  Best regards, Sam"
