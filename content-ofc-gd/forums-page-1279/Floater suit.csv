There is a Mustang Floater suit that was in a vacum bag. When the bag was opened it smelled a little moldy, it doesn't look to bad, so can I just wash it and let it hang dry or is she toast? I also found a few ice fishing rods, an old wood tip-up and a nasty looking homemade gaff that looks like a huge treble hook. The line needs to be replaced on the rods and tip-up, any recomondations?   Chris."
27811,fishindevil,2007-01-28 23:47:00,6254,"hey chris dont throw it out .  ...go to a laundrymat and put it in one of those real big industrial washers and put it through do not dry it hang it up i have washed mine several times and it wont hurt it at all,i spilled oil on my suite once and thought it was toast but after 3 washes it was almost gone...so go for it.no i was mine at least once a season....hope this helps    cheers"
27812,Fisherman,2007-01-28 23:48:00,7201,"Take it to a laundromat that has the BIF front load machines and use a very mild soap to wash it on the delicate setting, then let it hang to dry, should be good again. Ha, fishindevil beat me to it."
27815,nautifish,2007-01-28 23:54:00,1416,Gosh men that know how to do laundry and at the laundry mat to boot.......lol...Teasing...  Put it on a wool cycle  which is for very delicate washes.
27874,cisco,2007-01-29 01:19:00,597,"Can't beat free stuff from your dad! Good advice above re the launderymat thing. Or else load er up with cheap cologne or and have some eggs, beans and beer the night before. Pretty soon you'll wish the musty smell was back!"
27900,joonmoon,2007-01-29 02:11:00,528,Try spraying it with Frabreeze or something.
27934,Lowe Rider,2007-01-29 03:02:00,79,"Thanks guys and gal, washed it. Smells better, drip drying right now. Any suggestions on the type of fishing line to buy?"
27983,camillj,2007-01-29 05:24:00,1988,Just a safety note ... if I am not mistaken the mustangs have a 'life' as far as flotation goes ... around 5 years I believe ... be real careful .. cause a survival suit that doesnt float .. becomes an anchor ....  A buddy of mine tested his and sank STRAIGHT to the bottom .... it was a good thing this was summer-time in shallow water (read the instructions/labels)
27991,Dondorfish,2007-01-29 10:28:00,1000,Never heard tell of a float suit with a 5 year life span - is this true? I have friends with suits that gotta be pushing 20 years old now!    Don
28011,Raf,2007-01-29 13:22:00,3495,"It is true, the flotation material deteriorates over time."
28058,camillj,2007-01-29 15:26:00,1988,They will still keep ya warm ... just dont ASSUME they will keep ya afloat  ... and dont take chances so you will never need to find out
28080,glen,2007-01-29 15:57:00,2641,A float suit that dosn't float.  That could be very bad.  I guess i will test mine.
