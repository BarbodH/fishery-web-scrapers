28041,Entropy,2007-01-29 14:54:00,747,"ATV, hut, and trailer went through, these guys did good, got it all out in about 3.5 hours.  This was on Saturday, they said there was 8"" of ice, but only 3"" where it went through.        "
28042,Greencoachdog,2007-01-29 14:59:00,8163,Wonder who the Genius was that decided to do that without drilling test holes every so often?
28044,Terry,2007-01-29 15:00:00,14456,"man, you do have to be safe out there  wow look at all the ATVs with snow plows.....I take mine off to go out on the ice"
28047,mattyk,2007-01-29 15:05:00,2110,"Well, at least no one got injured."
28055,Rich,2007-01-29 15:24:00,3927,"Uh, pretty sure Twelve Mile is a lake on it's own.."

28207,turtle,2007-01-29 20:20:00,274,"If thats the 12 mile lake in Haliburton at hwys 35 and 118 (Carnarvon), there is a winter-long patch of bad ice at the narrows where Little Boshkung goes into 12 mile.  Depending on how cold the winter is the bad ice can be 50-100 yards + out from the narrows due to current.   My mother had a cottage around the corner from the narrows from 1985-2000 and there were approx 7-8 winter drownings on the lake, most at the narrows.  Not a laughing matter-in 1989 or so three guys drowned there on a Saturday night and I watched the OPP divers bring the last one up."
28227,Jigger,2007-01-29 21:21:00,1237,"That looks like it was one of the hut operators on 12Mile lake. Not up at the narrows, though. Good thing no-one was hurt. turtle, thats crazy, I never heard about that many fatalities. Crazy stuff!"
28358,Nanook,2007-01-30 02:05:00,565,"Glad they all got out OK, seems like lotsa help there. Now I know why I dont ice-fish, cant stand the cold either"
28417,joonmoon,2007-01-30 04:35:00,528,Hope the clients got their $ back.
28511,Entropy,2007-01-30 14:20:00,747,Not a hut op. and no it was not near the narrows.
28656,keiths,2007-01-30 20:27:00,30,Better to use a rope on the ice for towing. Too darn hard to cut the chain if towed truck or whatever goes through and starts to pull you into the hole!
