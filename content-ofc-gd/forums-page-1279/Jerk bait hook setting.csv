28391,GbayGiant,2007-01-30 03:32:00,1780,"Question for the musky and jerkbait/glider guys.  If your using a jerk bait that requires a downward pull/twitch towards the water, what is the best way to set the hook ?"
28392,ChrisK,2007-01-30 03:36:00,2772,As hard as possible in the direction you feel most apropriate at the time 
28436,steverowbotham,2007-01-30 05:40:00,1800,"I fish jerkbaits a lot in the fall for smallmouth, and my hookset always ends up going to the side.  it's really hard to explain and I lost a lot of fish before I got it down."
28445,Rich,2007-01-30 06:14:00,3927,Always use a sidearm hookset with the jerkbaits. The upward jerk can often pull the trebles out. A sweeping sideways hookset will keep them hooked.

28537,BabyHerc,2007-01-30 15:29:00,285,Side-sweep works for me on bass and pike.  It should work on muskie as well.
28584,David Chong,2007-01-30 17:18:00,836,"John, They're all right! A sideways sweep set is what I feel gets those hooks solidly! Love it when those Smallies are eating jerks! Cheers, Dave"
28678,GbayGiant,2007-01-30 21:43:00,1780,"Thanks guys it makes sense, I think my inital reaction was to set it strieght up like usual but I lost a few fish, I'll have to remember to go against my natural reaction next time."
28730,Slayingm,2007-01-31 00:14:00,204,Side arm 90% of the time.... the real key though is in the talking up the slack line quickly..... moving from the 6.5 to  7ft rod length can make all the difference in the world to driving the hook home.  Other key considerations include using a braid line with mono/flourocarbon leader (low stretch) and of course replacing all hooks with premium quality extra sharp ones...... more fish landed everytime.....Greg.
28736,Rich Clemens,2007-01-31 00:25:00,3131,Mine too .... Off to the side we go.
28843,fish4me,2007-01-31 03:39:00,59,"Side arm for sure.  You need to keep your rod tip down and slack out otherwise the fish may throw your bait.  If you set the hookup, you need to bring your rod tip down anyway, setting sideways skips that step.  If the fish misses, the bait may still be at the same level in the water coloumn, seting the hook up may pull the bait out of the water.  My 2 cents"
