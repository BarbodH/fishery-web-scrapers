27719,Aaron Shirley,2007-01-28 19:26:00,655,"Those are some really cool perch videos Terry.  Nice Simcoe perch report.  There was about 5"" of ice out from Gilford, and many ATV's and sleds out on the safe ice.  It's about time!  Aaron"
27774,steverowbotham,2007-01-28 22:27:00,1800,"Herring are closed year round on Simcoe, so I hope they didnt literally go in the box."
27783,Terry,2007-01-28 22:47:00,14456,"every time squid42(calamari1965) posts it's stuff like that...the person behind the name seems to get off on posts like that, I'm sure he/she/it wasn't even fishing..so don't worry about that .....but I could be wrong...lol"
27801,Joey,2007-01-28 23:29:00,9122,"Thanks for the report Terry.  We went out again today, to Innisfil this time, no luck again  Oh well, there's always next weekend  Joey"

27845,Rizzo,2007-01-29 00:44:00,4754,great videos Terry.  I've got a camera as well and let me tell you it seriously cuts into my fishing time!  Too fun just to watch.
27992,misfish,2007-01-29 10:32:00,29133,"Nice report bud.  The bike looks just great the way you have it set up and all.  I stayed local this weekend. I had to work on my conditioning ,walking up and down hills   .  No fish,but you learn how to walk fast when you hear cracking under yer feet  becarefull out there folks. One more week of these cold temps should make it alot safer.  Thanks for sharing"
27995,Terry,2007-01-29 11:26:00,14456,well you got on the ice that's the important thing... I think I need to work on my conditioning but not while wearing my winter boots

27327,Terry,2007-01-27 21:53:00,14456,"well got up and saw freezing rain there were reports of bad roads so I waited till 745 before I headed out most roads were pretty good, found a parking spot on the road, could see there were cars and trucks parked on the lake..and off I went     there was a plowed road out to the first hut, so someone had a truck out there...I stop near some huts set up dropped the camera and started looking for perch..didn't see any but did see 2 bass....a little early for them so I packed up and moved across the lake to gilford...oh first thing I did even before I got anything off the ATV..broke my good icefishing rod....figures I would think 1000s of people out there..and blue clam portable fish huts.tons of them, I should have bought stock in the company  hope it's big enough to see all the people      I set up and saw perch on the camera right away     they were not very big..but lots of them  here are some movie clips of them swimming around and some hook ups  movie    movie 2  movie 3  movie4 real busy playing with the aquavu..didn't even try my new fishfinder.....   well had a good time everything seems to be working ok can't wait to get out again"
