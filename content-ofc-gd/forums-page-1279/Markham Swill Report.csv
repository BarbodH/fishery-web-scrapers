And Carol, we definately have to get together soon  Here's some pics I took, and make sure you check out the Flinstone sized beef ribs some of us ordered, not only were they delicious, but enormous and very filling.             Cheers,  Joey"
27485,SlowPoke,2007-01-28 04:59:00,2984," Nice pic's Joey... funny you mentioned the Flintstone Ribs... Gary, Taper and I had ""The Brontosauras Burgers"" at the London Swill...  ""Brontosaurus Burger $6.99 YaBa DaBa Doo! For those with an unlimited appetite.  A 12 oz. char-broiled Beef Patti, fully loaded with bacon and cheese.  Served with fried potatoes and garnish.""  Here's a thought... we'll all meet at the Milton Quary for a swill - the London crowd can bring the Brontosauras Burgers and the GTA crowd can bring...... the beer"
