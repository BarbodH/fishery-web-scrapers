Click here to got to OFC Directory  Just choose and area and go from there. When you get it narrowed down ask on here for more info on certain places and I'm sure someone has been there or knows of it to help out. I don't think you can go wrong with the Nipissing area this time of the year. There's always fish being caught up there.  Good Luck with it.
