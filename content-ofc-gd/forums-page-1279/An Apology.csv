28324,Fish Farmer,2007-01-30 00:47:00,2234,"Gerritt, You got to get out fishin  . Don't forget, we got a meeting Feb 5"
28329,Gerritt,2007-01-30 00:52:00,6129,Sweet!!!! how was the bustrip?? good numbers of fish caught??  thanks guys I appreciate your support and will try and be more mindful   Gerritt.
28346,Nanook,2007-01-30 01:35:00,565,"Any Post of yours I've read, seemed OK to me. Keep 'em coming Buddie!  Any Post of yours I've read, seemed OK to me. Keep 'em coming Buddie!"
28388,fishergirl72,2007-01-30 03:02:00,455,"You have always been a friendly, great guy to me and have never offend me in any way at all! I hope everything falls into place for you soon!"
28419,holdfast,2007-01-30 04:45:00,1813,"I couldnt help go through these threads.  I just want to say is, speak your mind, which I guess you have done.  If you offend anybody who cares.  Ive learned through my own experiences you cant make everybody happy.  Its impossible unless your phoney.  As far as your APOLOGY, I may pay more attention to your threads because I never did before.  Hope that your personal stuff works out.  Because it will.  Of note.  Ive been banned a few times, Im still here maybe, because, I might have some positive comments, or something that may be interesting.  All I know is that the OFC Police are pretty quick here.  Maybe tooo quick"
28428,daisy_girl58,2007-01-30 05:08:00,116,hey it is better to vent on here rather than thoughts of dipping my you know who in you know what ice water to help him relieve his   stress!  Whew I feel better now! Thanx Gerritt!  lorissa
28430,TennesseeGuy,2007-01-30 05:26:00,957,"Hey Gerritt, I liked you better when you were meaner.  I'm uncomfortable around guys who are too nice."
28454,holdfast,2007-01-30 07:21:00,1813,"From A Guy out west"" I agree"
28029,Gerritt,2007-01-29 14:25:00,6129,"Ok time for me to ""man-up"" here... I have been knob-end for the past few months, alot of personal stuff happening that I wont bore you with and which I think has gotten the better of me. I have been critical of things I really should'nt have been critical about and I am sure I have been a thorn in the side of more then a couple people here.  Cabin fever has definatly set in..  I will do my best to think before I post and if I feel a little hot under the collar I plan on taking a stroll outside or something instead of venting on a Internet Fishing Forum.  Over the years I have made a great number of friends through OFC and we have been though some rough times over the years, I think back to the out-pouring of help I was on the recieving end of a couple years ago and you fine folks deserve alot more, then me acting like a idiot.  So.....  I just wanted to apologize to anyone I may have offended over the last little while.  Gerritt."
28032,Joey,2007-01-29 14:29:00,9122,No worries Gerritt.  We all have bad days and stress factors that make us act out without us even realizing what we're doing.  Hope you can de-stress and get out fishing soon.  How's this weekend looking bud?  Joey
28034,snag,2007-01-29 14:43:00,1932,"Actually,  I find that when you are critical, you typically end your response with a polite disclaimer simply stating that it is your opinion and that you are not here to offend.  You seem to be a class-act from what I've read?"
28036,Terry,2007-01-29 14:49:00,14456,"oh great,...now who will I get to agree with me,  when I go on a rant.....  I always like a lively debate........lol"
28038,Greencoachdog,2007-01-29 14:50:00,8163,"You haven't bothered me Bubba, get out and go ice fishin'! Y'all have a wonderful resource up there and you should utilize it!"
28039,Beans,2007-01-29 14:50:00,3339,"Joey said it...best mental health in the world for me is ""go fishing""..."
28045,ccmtcanada,2007-01-29 15:03:00,7971,Gerritt...no worries!  Everyone has bad days...consider everything else water under the bridge.
28051,OhioFisherman,2007-01-29 15:22:00,6623,Don`t worry be happy! LOL I am never grumpy!
28057,Rich,2007-01-29 15:26:00,3927,Completely unforgiveable! Hang him!  jk obviously. Actually I never noticed any negative posts from you Gerritt. Better get out that door and do some fishin.
28061,misfish,2007-01-29 15:28:00,29133,"Been there done that,totally understand dude."
28095,huntervasili,2007-01-29 16:41:00,1604," I agree with both snag and rick.... I have never actually disagreed with a comment of yours that I have read... But either way, we all know how hard it is to apologise for whatever was incorrectly done... In my opinion though, I would not refrain from somewhat critical posts as long as it is not a by-product of ""personal problems""... Otherwise it is a faceless post with no real ""brain"" behind it... Thats my 2 cents though,  Bill"
28099,BITEME,2007-01-29 16:48:00,1969,Totally understand got no problem with you at all would fish with you any time Dosent mean if we camp together you can spoon with me though
28100,Terry,2007-01-29 16:51:00,14456,it's not the spooning  it's the forking..you need to look out for.......lol
28101,BITEME,2007-01-29 16:51:00,1969,
28107,1leggedangler,2007-01-29 17:05:00,364,"Hey Gerritt,  I must have missed some posts because I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary besides the usual cabin fever that goes on this time of year. Takes a bigger man to admit mistakes though.  Cheers, 1leg"
28110,douG,2007-01-29 17:14:00,2693,"The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor, Is King of Men for a' that."
28112,Tybo,2007-01-29 17:26:00,1373,Yeah. But you are still a wanker
28113,Mike Pike,2007-01-29 17:26:00,1332,What DouG said!  ..whatever it means.
28117,TJQ,2007-01-29 17:32:00,7806,Your always my bud dude.. no apolgies necessary for me.
28119,setomonkey,2007-01-29 17:34:00,872,"I don't actually remember reading any of your posts and thinking they were offensive, but regardless I think it's a solid thing to own up to your behavior and to make a public statement about it.  Look forward to more posts from you and hope you get to go fishing soon...  Mike"
28128,aplumma,2007-01-29 17:53:00,6896,I am glad to see that things are getting better for you and the fog is lifting enough for you to see all of your friends around you. The minor abuse you dished out as of late is quickly forgotten by all of your true friends. Welcome back buddy.  Art
28131,Daplumma,2007-01-29 17:59:00,1961,"I must have missed the really bad stuff.No worries bud,see ya in June. Joe"
28136,Smokey,2007-01-29 18:08:00,1278,"Gerritt no worries. Everyone goes thru there time on here when they vent a bit. We see it every year and more often in the winter months. It was your turn and some of the things said where aimed in the right direction and hopefully heard.  As for going for a walk and cooling off, you sure picked the right time of the year for that. It's -23 with the wind chill today that should do it.  Mike"
28234,Squid,2007-01-29 21:37:00,1656,"Word !! But seriously, DouG needs to apologize to the board for his use of the english language!!"
28238,steve_paul,2007-01-29 21:42:00,658," Only for the words I don't understand  Gerritt, good post.  As others have said, you express your opinions very well and always note they are not meant to offend."
