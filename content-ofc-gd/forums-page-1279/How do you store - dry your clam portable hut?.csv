28318,dmagz,2007-01-30 00:38:00,6,Hey haven't been on in quite a while.  I got a clam 2000 for xmas and took it on it's maiden voyage today off willow beach and then to cooks. I accumulated some snow inside and i was just wondering how do you store / dry out your clam portable hut?  any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.  Dave.
28332,ch312,2007-01-30 00:53:00,1590,set it up in the basement and place a dehumidifer inside it. open the rear vent and windows flaps and then close both doors. works like a charm.

Crank up the propane heater both inside and the big tank heater on my shelf in the garage. It will be dry in no time. Works for my portable, good luck. I didn't see a fish report from ya? How did ya do?"
