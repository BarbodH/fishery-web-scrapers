28539,1leggedangler,2007-01-30 15:32:00,364,"Hi All,  I would like to identify myself as the proud owner of Jack's beautiful carving. Just another fine example of the wonderful people on this board. I have never had the pleasure to meet Jack in person. I had sent him a PM commenting on his carvings and we got to talking about dogs. I briefly mentioned about losing our chocolate Lab Seamus just over a year ago. Next thing I know Jack says if he finds the time he might be able to come up with something. To say the least I was in awe that a man I have never met would build me a carving so my family and I could have something to remeber our family pet. My family and I will cherish Jack's carving for a very long time. Thanks's so much Jack and to OFC for allowing me to connect with such fine people.  Cheers, Jim and Family  Jim"
28543,lew,2007-01-30 15:47:00,12767,"Jim, Jack is indeed a good person who I've had the pleasure of meeting a couple of times. That carving will be a great reminder of your dog for many years to come.  Awhile back I mentioned on this board that I was in the market for some plexi-glass and right away Jack PMed me to say that he had some he wasn't using and I was more than welcome to it.  Some real decent folks hang out on this board"
28546,Beans,2007-01-30 15:52:00,3339,Yep...That's my buddie Jack for ya!...  Wadda Guy !!!  Like they say Jack...You da Man !!!

Thank you all for your comments,you've made me feel REAL good about myself,gave me a lift just at the right time...............Winter blahs"
