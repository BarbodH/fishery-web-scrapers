28242,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-01-29 21:56:00,115,"Bring a sandwich...    Good luck Irish!!!! I mean if you are bringing a coleman stove, you might as well bring something to cook on it, not just breading"
28243,irishfield,2007-01-29 21:59:00,26272, Tried that last year..rock face that went straight in...34 FOW a couple feet from the shoreline. Nadda.
28253,fishforfun,2007-01-29 22:16:00,105,Temagami is a tough lake thru the ice Wayne as you know Have you thought about renting a hut  JK
28258,irishfield,2007-01-29 22:24:00,26272,"Na...they cheat and chum the holes! LOL Besides, Martin, I can stand to lose a few pounds."
28260,Stein,2007-01-29 22:26:00,22," While I would agree that it would be a great show-- any cold weather series would be a great test, we'll never see it.  Gotta give the audience girls in bikinis."
28262,Squid,2007-01-29 22:35:00,1656,"I'd use the auger to retire a bunny or a grouse, screw the ice fishing!  Seriously now, is it a lake that you have already fished in the summer or is it a lake that you do not know at all??  Points, bays and river mouths[ this one being dangerous] would be where I would start. Drill out 200 feet from shore and you should get into some muskies!!  Just kidding. Round about fifty feet and check the depth. Most fish will be in the 15 to 35 foot areas. Of course the lakers et al will be out much deeper. In between islands would be a good bet also. Back bays will hold fish too."
28265,irishfield,2007-01-29 22:42:00,26272,"Thanks Pete!  I made it hypothetical to get what I was hoping... ""What makes you decide where to drill a hole""...shoreline detail/island/point etc.  Maybe I looked too hard...read too much into things last time out. Maybe instead of travelling all over a slush covered lake last year I should have just drilled a hole between the shoal/point of my own Island and dock...considering all my PB's have come casting off my dock casting at that very spot!"
28268,Squid,2007-01-29 22:47:00,1656,How deep is it in front of your dock?
28269,irishfield,2007-01-29 22:49:00,26272,Right at the dock 12' tapers out to 34 FOW for most of the bay.
28278,camillj,2007-01-29 23:02:00,1988,I'd look for a dead birch along the shorline ... dont ask me why ...but the hottest spots always seem to be right out from a dead birch stump  Then I'd eat the chocolate bar that would be stashed in my pocket and try to figure out how on earth I am gona fish without a hook or bait  Time to start trackin and setting snares
28279,Squid,2007-01-29 23:07:00,1656,I would drill several holes out from 12 to 35 ft and start shallow in the morning and evening and out deeper through the day. Move around through the week if you plan on staying that long. The pics will come by.
28283,irishfield,2007-01-29 23:14:00,26272,Thanks Pete...Will give everyones suggestions a whirl if I get up there. Medical issues in the family my have just put the weekend trip on hold.
28285,fishindevil,2007-01-29 23:25:00,6254,"first id curse and swear  ,then have a tantrum,  curse some more then,drill holes and curse   and swear and hope i caught a fish,then curse some more.  .....oh wait sorry this is what i do all the time...  .oh ill have to re-think that one wayne i thought you were talking about everytime i go ice fishing....lol...lol"
28288,PatB,2007-01-29 23:33:00,104,"Excellent question, First find a drug store after 2 days with out food I'd have one hell of a headache First I'd drill holes shallow to deep set up lines there, then build a few snares to catch some animals, probably be easier than catching fish."
28360,camillj,2007-01-30 02:08:00,1988,Just to be sure Wayne ... I wasnt joking about the Birch ...  Find a Bay then poke holes between the points working you way out the middle of the bay  And if you do happen to know a 'hotspot from the summer give it a whirl for sure in the winter ... they dont stray too far from the tree ya know ... maybe just a little deeper  And for the lakers dont be afraid to go deeeeep ... I have had LOTS of luck at 90+ feet just a few feet off bottom ... I'd actually lay a set line on the bottom in deep water (with heavier line) and wait for a biggun while pokin around in the shallows  jiggin minnows (slowly)... and dont forget ot bring the fishfinder ... it will tell ya whether lots more is hapening down there than you can feel (or see)
28390,Jigger,2007-01-30 03:25:00,1237,"If you knew you were going to get dropped off somewhere, wouldn't you eat for the two days before you left? Now if you were kidnapped and placed on a lake...and it was a gas auger"
28414,joonmoon,2007-01-30 04:23:00,528,Some anglers always carry safety items like ice picks and cleats...well I always carry bait and food with me on every outing. Wayne if ya go drill a few holes in and around your dock cause fish will hold on it in the winter as well as summer. If thats a bust try a little deeper and in the direction of your PBs. Other than that just make a snowball spin around and chuck it where it lands drill a hole do that three consecutive times and then just jig the holes for 5 min each and rotate thru them. You will catch something to eat. Confidence is half the game. Keepin warm is the other half.
28142,irishfield,2007-01-29 18:14:00,26272,"...with your ice auger, rod, coleman stove and a bag of fish-crisp. You haven't eaten at all for 2 days...  How would you decide where to drill your first hole in the ice... with great expectations of eating some lunch?"
28145,Roy,2007-01-29 18:18:00,13728,"Wait, I'm visualizing.....did I pack a lunch?"
28148,Tybo,2007-01-29 18:27:00,1373,First I would have to find something to make a hook out of.  You can tell me to shut up any time now Wayne.
28150,Whopper,2007-01-29 18:31:00,2174,I'll give my best guess  I'd find a point and start drilling holes in hopes of finding a drop off and start there. another place would be an island and try to find the same as above.  I'd probably be able to go a couple more days with the body fat that I carry  Whopper
28151,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-29 18:36:00,0,I'd use the SWAG method Wayne
28152,Kirk,2007-01-29 18:39:00,347,"I'd start by eating the fish crisp  to be serious, I'd start drilling near shore to get an idea of bottom layout, hopefully eyeball some fish and drill out deeper until I got lucky  are we on a body of water with a two line limit?"
28153,Terry,2007-01-29 18:45:00,14456,sell the equipment and go to a restaurant
28154,Cookslav,2007-01-29 18:47:00,1457,Bring a shovel....clear the snow and look through the ice for the feesh
28163,BabyHerc,2007-01-29 19:02:00,285,"I'd pay close attention to shoreline character and trees present - though I'm not an ice-fisherman, I do know that coniferous trees are found mostly in sandy/rocky substrates, with deciduous trees more abundant in softer ground-types.  I would then look at the shoreline for clues to lake-bottom topography - the lake bottom often mirrors what we see on the shoreline.  Throw in a point and an island as Whopper said, and I'll be damned if I'm starving to death."
28165,Harrison,2007-01-29 19:04:00,2202,"Agreed, Id look for the point that extends the furthest out into the lake.  Start at the tip near shore and work outwards crisscrossing the tip or middle of the underwater point 50yrds on either side.  You will be on a drop and fish at somepoint.  Or, if the elements were an issue I would look for the tallest/steepest hillside or cliff that tapers in to the lake.. should have the deepest drop off closest to shore."
28167,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-29 19:11:00,2585,I would look to ice fish river mouths or creeks. With the current normally there are some fish around. although often unsafe so lots of holes drill to be safe.  Then I would do what someone else already suggested and scout the shore for some fire wood.  Cheers!
28172,walleyejigger,2007-01-29 19:24:00,876,"tough one,  as stated before eat the fish crisp allready, next since if it's a lake we truly know nothing of( even species of fish present) i would fish shallows, if there's a swampy end in the sun, using really small pieces of bait and hoping for perch and such, and maybe even baitfish should be present  i choose this because it's probably easiest to find and i think better chances of hitting a few dinks than hoping for a bigger something,   for all i know there could be no fish present, but a good chance that there's at least perch, baitfish and if in the north maybe even hammer handles, if not small trout frequent these areas also  as u can see i'm fishing for survival and not a feast  anyways, great topic wayne"
28175,Rich,2007-01-29 19:24:00,3927,Well I can tell ya after the last 3 days of ice fishing for me I'd be starving to death.
28177,Headhunter,2007-01-29 19:28:00,5703,Well after removing all the sharp objects in pockets and having finished the required puckering up and kissing my ___ goodbye... I'd probably do as mentioned and look for any points extending into the lake/river and begin drilling there and work my way deeper. HH
28184,ccmtcanada,2007-01-29 19:39:00,7971,"Since I know nothing about ice fishing, I'd probably drop all the heavy stuff and look for a road...pick left or right and start walking!!!"
28190,kemper,2007-01-29 19:52:00,2232,"Well since I know jack about ice fishing, Id probably fish the same areas I would in the summer..."
28197,Fisherman,2007-01-29 20:00:00,7201,"I'd look around and see if anyone else was there and go bug them for some info, next, make a big smokey fire, Wayne will fly by and think somebody needs rescuing.    don't forget the SOS sign, dot over a square I think.  All else fails, follow the ""lay of the land"" into the water and make an educated guess as to depth, go fish, make sure the drag isn't set too tight otherwise you might loose the first fish and your hook will be gone."
28198,mattyk,2007-01-29 20:01:00,2110,"I think this should be the next survivor series. Drop some people off in northern Ontario with an auger, some ice fishing poles, and some warm clothes and see if they make it."
28206,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-01-29 20:16:00,115,"What a loaded question    too many variables not explained....  I would go drill a hole beside the other anglers, especially if i see them catching fish or blood stains on the ice   or is this some acid rain fallout lake up in the middle of nowhere, than if that is the case, buddy better drop me off at a diner cause i ain't fishin on an empty stomach, especially a 2 day old empty stomach  or trade my auger to the locals for food, explain to them how this auger is the next greatest tool for smacking big bear around to get warm fur   If this is a serious question, i would definitley look at the shoreline and pick an area that had a creek, river leading into it. Current always holds fish. If can't seem to locate such, wouild look at shoreline for a steady dropping shoreline, say at least a 30 to 45 degree angled shoreline and start 20 feet from shore and work out."
28215,Raf,2007-01-29 20:36:00,3495,I would look where BabyHerc is fish'n because he has the right idea.
28218,Greencoachdog,2007-01-29 20:46:00,8163,"My first hole would be in a Mc Donalds parking lot to stand my auger up in while I went in to buy a half dozen Whaler fish sandwiches, fries, and a Coke!"
28224,Uncle Buck,2007-01-29 21:12:00,1000,"follow the crowd, fish close ( within reason) to them..."
28230,1leggedangler,2007-01-29 21:33:00,364,"Try to remember if my will and insurance were in order!Then maybe eat some bark and lick the ice a couple of times. Never had much luck ice fishing.  Cheers, 1leg"
28231,irishfield,2007-01-29 21:33:00,26272,"Amazing what can be done to delay cabin fever around here LOL !  Seriously....this was a serious question..just spiced up a tad to ""catch"" your interest.  Goran...there are no crowds to follow. Last time I struck out I was the only guy on the lake and shooting blind, with a single ice fishing expedition under my belt with DWC and Tonyb leading the way. Sounds like I did a few things correctly....but definitely not my second day where I picked a spot out in the depths and once punched thru I found with my humminbird portable that I was on 180FOW.  I'm headin North on Friday and hopefully with the help of this thread will eat!  Wayne"
28237,snoil,2007-01-29 21:42:00,139,Bring a sandwich...
