27911,Slayingm,2007-01-29 02:27:00,204,"Well, the colder weather the past few days has certainly made big improvements to the ice conditions on many of the larger northern lakes. This has allowed us to travel further and onto new bodies of water for the 1st time this season.   The wait has been worth it as the clients I had out today enjoyed some amazing laker action with all the trout caught being much larger then average. We ended up getting 2 lakers in the 10lb class and others in the 4-6lb class and the smallest fish of the day was in the 3lb range.   Shortly after setting up the fight was on with the first fish of the day....  http://profishntanglingservices.com/MyPictures/000_0215.jpg  After a long fight we successfully iced the fish and after a quick pic she was released.  http://www.profishntanglingservices.com/My.../000_0216-5.jpg Here is a pic of the little one being released in the 'Hot Hole'....  http://www.profishntanglingservices.com/My...000_0218-75.jpg   All of the fish we caught were native trout (no stockers) and other then 1 fish for a meal the rest were all released.   Here is a pic of me holding up one of the biggest fish of the day... the colour and makings of these fish were just beautiful.  http://www.profishntanglingservices.com/My...es/000_0221.jpg   Fish were caught in 58 to 82' of water. Small minnow tipped spoons worked just off bottom and minnows on tip-ups worked best..... the minnow bite was hot today.   Take care and be safe out there....Greg.

28213,kemper,2007-01-29 20:34:00,2232,"A laker is one of the few freshwater game fish that I have never caught, but it looks like a hell of a time. One of these days ill get out on the ice and catch some fish, but I just cant get past the fact that I hate the cold, i hate ice, and Id rather wait untill softwater season, lol."

28716,Slayingm,2007-01-30 23:54:00,204," Hi Smokey.... totally agree..... the previous day on other lakes all we could get was fish in the 1 to 2.5lb range.... really nice to get some line screamer's for a change...Greg.  Good luck out there!   Hey Kemper,  Your really missing ou bud.... a portable hut and propane heater will allow you to fish gloves and hat free!!..... its most enjoyable and certainly makes the winter pass by quickly.... get out and give it a try.... you'll be hooked for every....Greg."
