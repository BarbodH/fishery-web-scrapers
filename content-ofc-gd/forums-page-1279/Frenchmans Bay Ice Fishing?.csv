28293,urbanangler1990,2007-01-29 23:43:00,933,im just curious about if this bay is ice fishable? has anyone ever fished the bay in pickering? any luck?
28307,Lowe Rider,2007-01-30 00:12:00,79,"Jethro, Frenchman's and the outflow from the Nuke plant are two different places. As for ice fishing I don't ever remember seeing anyone out on the bay.  Chris."
28311,fishindevil,2007-01-30 00:20:00,6254,"we use to fish it ...maybe 20yrs ago and we caught panfish,bullheads and the odd small pike,i have heard that for the last 10yrs ago there is crappies in there but i dont know that for sure..its generally only 4-10ft deep in most places there is perch and rock bass in there as well..hope this helps and dont be afraid to try it we did along time ago just for the heck of it and had fun catching all those panfish..cheers"
28342,fishinfool,2007-01-30 01:22:00,366,I live right here in Pickering and go down there all the time. I have seen many people out in Frenchman's Bay ice fishing the last three years. Sorry I don't know what they are catching. I may give it a try this weekend and I will post a report.
28356,MJL,2007-01-30 02:04:00,2427,I don't ice fish but I have caught some trophy crappies around the marina during the spring time.  I would imagine they would still be around at this time of year
28363,eyefish,2007-01-30 02:09:00,135,lots of guys fish down there...they catch  some pike in the bay as well as panfish
28501,Basskicker,2007-01-30 13:32:00,421,Actually there are some rather impressive pike in there....I've seen quite a few in the 8-10lb range.....and someone caught a 13lb pike when I was there last year.....you usually don't get many...but when you do..they are big!  Jason
28515,Weeds,2007-01-30 14:30:00,782,"Fished there in the summer a few years back. Loads of Carp, no sign of anything else and really shallow, 2, 3 and four feet deep."
28525,urbanangler1990,2007-01-30 14:55:00,933,"ok thnx guys, looks like i may give it a try..."
28541,Beans,2007-01-30 15:40:00,3339,"I used to icefish Frenchman's in my early teens (58 years ago)...A buddy and I would buy 25 cents worth of emerald shiners from Skinner's on Saturday, take the bus out hwy 2 early Sunday morning then walk down to the bay and chop holes in the ice with a hatchet...used to get lots of perch and bluegills and the odd pike using homemade tip-ups...  Fast forward to the late sixties and I would give Simcoe a try for whitefish in the morning and if no luck I would take my kids down to Frenchman's for panfish with the minnows we had left over...I've seen it so good that I would have to take a couple of lines out of the water so I could keep up with baiting their hooks...  Have often wondered if anybody still icefished there...over by the south west corner was usually the best area way back when..."
