Two of us got skunked. I missed at least three for sure my other buddy missed one for sure. Joan kicked our butts. She lost one at the hole (nice fish about 7 to 8 pounds). She had it half way out of the hole and it jumped and broke her line and took MY LURE back to the depths. Gave her one of my other bud’s lures and she continued to put a show on. I actually fished one hole for a good ¾ of an hour and left. Joan came over and started to fish it and missed two and landed one. She managed to put the only five fish that were caught on the ice. It’s too bad she aint never going fishing with us again and it has nothing to do with her kicking butt.     Oh alright maybe a bit. The ice we fished on was 12 to 13 inches thick, we marked a few fish. This was an area that I wanted to try because I knew no-one was fishing it. So I guess I guided one person to the right place. Next time I go out I’m going back there and trying in a different spot. Let you all know when I know for a fact that their stacked. Usually it is a little later in the season. I may have not caught any fish last night but it was a nice peaceful night to watch some-one else catch them. I’ll get the touch back, then watch out Ms Joanne. Then I may invite you again (maybe) Have fun be safe and bring back everything you took with you…………Ron"
