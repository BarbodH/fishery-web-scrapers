27496,Joey,2007-01-28 05:14:00,9122,"Well, after a indecisive morning with the freezing rain, we ended up going to meet up with Chuck and Shelly for a nice day of fishing and chatting.  The weather was great once we got up there and there was definately a good 4 inches of black ice.  We set up our new Clam and proceeded to do a jig  DouG and Emil were also there, and apparently we just missed Brian (Misfish).  Shelley had one on for awhile, but lost it     And other people were catching all around us, but none for us today.  Maybe tomorrow  A poor little fox was roaming around looking for handouts also.  Poor thing had mange or something.  Check out his tail.  Some guys were giving him minnows, another gave him some pepperoni and I gave him a piece of chicken.  He sniffed at the chicken, then left it, went back to the pepperoni, took another piece, buried it in the snow, then grabbed the chicken and made a mad dash for the shore, as if he wanted to eat that prized possession in private  Here's some pics.                    After fishing we headed to the Markham Swill.  No wonder I'm tired  Cheers,  Joey"

27526,motv8tr,2007-01-28 09:35:00,2587,"Hey Joey, glad to see you guys made it out and managed to meet up with a couple of people.  I won't venture out unless the ice is closer to 12""  .  Nauti, I expect it's much quieter during the week, all the weekend warriors are back to work.  Maureen"

28027,John Kimble,2007-01-29 14:12:00,12,"It was nice talking to Chevy and Lady Walleye again (its been a few years!), and nice meeting Doug and Misfish for the first time. Thanks again Chevy for showing me the aqua view - wow, that's definately a great toy for ice fishing.  We managed to get 3 whities, and 1 laker all between 11:30 and 1:30pm - lost another 4 or so halfway up the hole. The key was the massive crowd leaving - it was too noisy with the many spuds, gas augers and even the axes hammering away at the ice every few minutes.  Anyways, it was definately great to be out and to be catching whities and lakers again. We'll do it again this week!  Day's Catch   WHOO HOOO!   Cheers, ~Ryan (John Kimble!)  P.S. - I'm back home for good now, just finished my 1 year contract in the states as a Marine Biologist- YEAH! Let me know if you want to hook up anytime!"
28028,Fisherman,2007-01-29 14:21:00,7201,"Good to see Chucks back on the ice, mighty fine looking whitie Ryan."

28064,duber,2007-01-29 15:31:00,220,Good just to get out there isn't it.Thanks for the report Joey.
28097,douG,2007-01-29 16:42:00,2693,"Great to see old friends again, had a great yak with misfish.  And yes, sauerkraut on a gweech - I call it 'The Moistmaker'.  I am saddened that no one has stepped up to photoshop a nice laker there in my photo with Tybo.  I did my part, anyway.  Thanks for the post, Joanne."
