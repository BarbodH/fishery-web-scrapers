678063,Gord,2012-03-21 01:57:00,20,Has anyone fished out of Green Wilderness? If so any good/bad tips? Thanks
678142,Targa01,2012-03-21 13:12:00,46,"Are you talking about Green wilderness on Mattagami lake in Gogama? if so, i personally haven't been there but I fish the lake a lot. When I go I either stay at Minakwa lodge or twin j hide a way. Both of those lodges are closer to the better fishing areas than green wilderness."
678374,Gord,2012-03-22 01:41:00,20, Yes. Is it that much better fishing at Minakwa. Where are the good spots. Thanks
678452,Targa01,2012-03-22 13:04:00,46,"what time of year are you going there? Yes Minakwa is the better area to fish, The southeast arm is usually the best area of the lake."
678691,Gord,2012-03-23 01:05:00,20," Going 1st wk in june, what do you think?"
678810,Targa01,2012-03-23 13:58:00,46,"June is a great time to fish there, but the only problem with fishing the 1st week is that a big walleye tournament is going on there and there will be 130 boats on the water and if you don't already have reservations at a lodge you wont get any that week due to the tournament. If I were you I would wait till the 2nd week and you will have the lake to yourself unless you are fishing the tournament."
679101,Gord,2012-03-24 01:16:00,20, Thank you so much for the heads up on the tournament. We will plan the second wk. What are the dates of the tourny. Thanks again buddy .
679330,Tootsie II,2012-03-24 15:55:00,162,"Dates this year are Sat. and Sun, June 2nd and 3rd. You can look it up if you want by searching NOWT ( Northern Ontario Walleye Trail) They run 5 or 6 derbies across the North."
679372,Targa01,2012-03-24 17:32:00,46,"Tootsie II is right on the date, it is the first event for the NOWT tournaments so it always has a great turnout. We are having a early spring this year so June should be a great time for fishing at Mattagami, usually the southeast arm is the best place that time of year."
