679095,Burtess,2012-03-24 00:45:00,901,"I am starting to freak out here...... I caught my first brown of the year on Tuesday morning and then lost one of my staple lures... I only have one left!!!  I cannot find this colour combo anywhere, have been to Bass Pro, Crappy Tire, Walmart, doesn't appear to be in LeBaron cataloge (although I have not checked the store yet).  It is not on the Luhr Jensen website either.... maybe an old discontinued pattern?  Anyone seen this one around??  Luhr Jensen Krocodile 2 5/8"" and 1/2 oz.  Chartreuse on both sides with silver tape:     I am scared that I will not be able to catch any more pier browns....     Burt"
679097,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-24 01:06:00,10439,"Wow!!! Don't tell me they got rid of their best pier pitching spoon!!! I still have a couple in my box, but now a days they are used for ice fishing duty.  I would start looking around the smaller tackle shops for them. There's a better chance of finding one if they have been discontinued."
679100,Burtess,2012-03-24 01:14:00,901," Don't worry, the spoon still exists... just this colour pattern is possibly gone.  Burt"
679126,Nipfisher,2012-03-24 02:00:00,2449,I have a silver one with a pearl tape on it. Only tried it once through the ice but it is now in my summer tackle bag.
679127,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-24 02:02:00,10439, Sorry should have said best colour pier pitching spoon.
679217,solopaddler,2012-03-24 11:40:00,8605,"Interesting. That's always been a favourite color of mine too, I've got at least 6 identical ones in my collection.  If you're really desperate you can have them for $25 each LOL!  Recently I've had very good success on the piers using a very different spoon.  Short fat, compact spoons like the KO Wobbler and Moonshine Glow Spoons in a variety of colors have been lethal.  Point is, it's a good spoon, but not the be all and end all trust me."
679268,Burtess,2012-03-24 13:42:00,901,"  OK.... I'll go as high as $15....  I did pick up a Mepps Little Wolf on my search.  It is a shorter wide spoon with an interesting bend to it.  Going to give it a shot.  You know what it is like when you build up confidence in a certain lure or technique.... I have no problem trying ""new"" things but it is always nice to have the old sure thing in the back pocket!  Burt"
679315,Sinker,2012-03-24 15:34:00,8692,"I have an assortment of those spoons as well. I use them for jigging eyes on quinte hardwater. They work great. I wouldn't sell them though, not even for $25 each! They still make them, so don't give up yet!!  S."
679327,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-24 15:46:00,10439,"  Thanks for under cutting me buddy!!!!! I got mine up in the classified section for $300 a piece since they are very rare and discontinued!!!!  I used to have a lot of luck chucking Cotton Cordell Big O plugs as well. Perch, chartreuse, silver and best of all pearl white worked well for me."
