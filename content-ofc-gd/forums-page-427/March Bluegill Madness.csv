678718,The Urban Fisherman,2012-03-23 02:17:00,2050,"I took out the old man and the kids to hit up some really early season bluegill.  There was no rhyme or reason tonight - we caught fish on tiny crankbaits in 2 FOW and others on micro jigs right on bottom in 15 FOW... Tougher bite then usual for this time of year but we had a great time and caught some good fish! Can't go wrong for a Thursday evening in March! Get out there an enjoy the weather!  Averie's first fish of 2012 - we had no ice season... boo   Lukes's first of 2012 - Grandpa got the assist... haha   Where'd they got man?   Averie had a bit of a tough go tonight but she kept pluggin' away   The kids during their movie break...   Daddy caps off the night with the biggest fish of the evening.. as usual! haha   It's hard to beat catching big gills on small crankbaits!   Group shot with grandpa before heading home...   Have a good weekend!  Cheers, Ryan & the Fam"
678721,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-23 02:20:00,2690,Great stuff buddy!!! Some awesome gills...can't wait to fish that little spot again.
678723,Pikeslayer,2012-03-23 02:24:00,1443,Awesome Ryan!! March! Can you believe it??
678724,Rustic-Fisher,2012-03-23 02:25:00,826,Great night for that! Nice fish.
678725,i2cool2fool,2012-03-23 02:25:00,349,Good times. Probably a highlight for the kids. Awesome.
678727,Live2fish85,2012-03-23 02:28:00,1633,Awesome. I hope my daughters enjoy fishing as much as Averie seems to.  Got to love this weather.
678729,The Urban Fisherman,2012-03-23 02:42:00,2050," Buddy trout opener is going to be a mess if this weather keeps up!  There's already bass and bluegill up in the shallow's... by the time trout opens we're going to be fishing them with dipsy divers! lol   Thanks brother - It's insane really... The lake is already in full blown spring mode... I can't complain about fishing in shorts at this time of year though!   Thanks J.O.P!   My boy is just getting into it, and he had the most fun he's ever had fishing... He had a great time with his grandpa... that's what it's all about!   Averie love's fishing, but she was frustrated tonight.. she missed like 10 fish in a row and just about lost it! hahaha"

678733,spinnerbaitking,2012-03-23 02:48:00,1622,"Excellent report great to see the kids out, hoping to get my Grand  daughters soon Tight Lines SBK"
678761,Musky or Specks,2012-03-23 10:43:00,2710,Browns are going to be done there and down deep before the season even opens if this weather keeps up
678771,The Urban Fisherman,2012-03-23 11:59:00,2050,L2p- thanks man! It was a good time!  SBK - thanks buddy - nothing beats time out with the little ones!  Musky or Specs - you're absolutely right... They're already moving down.... If we want to target trout on opener it'll be trolling bottom bouncers or dipsys
678780,bigugli,2012-03-23 12:19:00,6138,Nothing beats a day out with the kids.
