679143,Live2fish85,2012-03-24 02:51:00,1633,There you go Muskymatt lol.
679145,tb4me,2012-03-24 02:53:00,3295,3 in a row....un oh
679146,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-03-24 02:54:00,310,   Go Sens Go!!!   Stick to  Hab fans
679151,Leecher,2012-03-24 02:59:00,7832, Don't kid yourself too much
679152,Live2fish85,2012-03-24 03:03:00,1633, Gotta love sens fans don't know what a cup is but think losing in the first round makes you king lol.  At least us leafs fan don't think they are number one when they arn't lol.
679155,tb4me,2012-03-24 03:11:00,3295,Do the Leafs play the sens again? Id love to be the Team that knocks the Sens out with a win..lol That would be most wonderfull!!
679157,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-03-24 03:17:00,310," Funny how I never mentioned ""We're #1... or losing in 1st round...  Unless you're at least 50 years old, you Leaf fans don't know what a cup is either!!!  Or the playoffs for that matter... 2004's a LONG time ago...  The Sens will win a cup before the Leafs or Habs. Our future is bright, yours is bleak.   "
679160,Leecher,2012-03-24 03:20:00,7832, I repeat myself... Don't kid yourself too much   Sens will crumble in the first round like they usually do
679164,Live2fish85,2012-03-24 03:26:00,1633,"Yea really, I may not be 50 but I cheer a team that has won. Do you lol? I am also not 8 years old so I have seen the leafs in the playoffs.  I have seen the leafs play in the playoffs and make it past the first round more then you sens fans."
679167,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-24 03:29:00,0,oof... that was a harsh game to watch... i'm not sure what was worse... the sens defensive zone coverage or the referees.  apparently both were terrible because that was ugly!   what i find odd is leaf fans rejoicing in a habs win.  real leaf fans would be ashamed of you!!!
679168,Live2fish85,2012-03-24 03:32:00,1633,I never once said anything about the habs wins. Could care less if a team with the toilet seat win.  I just wanted to comment on you sens fans thinkibg your number one being ahead of the leafs and when it really counts your choking.
679172,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-24 03:36:00,10439," We aren't cheering a Habs win, that would be sacrilegious. We are cheering another Sens loss.    :clapping:"
679174,Leecher,2012-03-24 03:42:00,7832, YEP
679176,Live2fish85,2012-03-24 03:47:00,1633, Well said.
679190,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-24 05:23:00,0,"nobody wins when the habs win.  to even rejoice in a sens loss at the hands of the habs is despicable.  some of you leaf fans have forgotten your roots, if you have any."
679312,tb4me,2012-03-24 15:23:00,3295,"Ha ha this is funny Doc, I smell desperation in a big way with this post...You notawa fans auto default to the Leafs..Awesome...To bad we dont play you guys again..I would have loved to be the team that seals the deal for them..Oh well The leafs play Buffalo twice in 6..  On the bright side Alfie will have lots of time to get the dress back out real soon!!!  "
