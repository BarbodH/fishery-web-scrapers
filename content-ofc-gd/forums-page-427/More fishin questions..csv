Pine, Grass and Green have bass and muskies and I think they have been stocking some walleye but I don't know how they are doing. You can get through these lakes with a small boat. In some water levels, or with abit of work and a small boat you can get into Boshkung then to Little Boshkung and 12 Mile. Good natural lakers on Boshkung. It's a little busy in the summer there, but a nice, cute little community around Stanhope."
679112,Bigfoot2,2012-03-24 01:32:00,12, Thanks for the info. I love bass fishing. Hope there is a bit of size. Also enjoy the wally's and lakers for some early season fishing.  I am thinking of getting a 14-15 ft aluminum with a 15-25 hp on it. Hope i can get around on it. If not i can always trailer to Boshkung to try there.
