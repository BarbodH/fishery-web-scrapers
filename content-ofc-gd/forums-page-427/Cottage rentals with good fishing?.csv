679692,Muskieman,2012-03-25 05:44:00,2472,  Yep..
679722,Nipfisher,2012-03-25 13:04:00,2449,Ya but no carp here guys. It is an easy 3 hour drive in good conditions.
679724,express168,2012-03-25 13:11:00,327,"For pike and bass plus a bunch of other species with a large selection of cottages Nipissing would definately top the list. Closer to Toronto you have Cooks Bay/Lake Simcoe for good pike and bass but other than the Provincial Park for camping I am not familiar of any cottage rentals. Use the Ontariofishing.net lodge directory and you are sure to find something, all broken down into regions and can access all of their websites. Awesome tool."

They are close (1.5 to 2 hours from Toronto), have decent fishing and the accommodations/boat rentals are reasonably priced.  Check out Rice, Pigeon, Chemong, Sturgeon, Upper and Lower Buckhorn, Stoney, Balsam, Jack and Cameron Lakes."
