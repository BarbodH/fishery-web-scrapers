679114,dnb_cbr,2012-03-24 01:44:00,61,"genetically identical, its a behavioral difference."
679120,Live2fish85,2012-03-24 01:52:00,1633, That is one beauty looking rainbow.
679121,Fisherman,2012-03-24 01:53:00,7201,"Anadromous indicates being in ""sea"" water or salt as opposed to freshwater, therefore what we have in the Great Lakes is not a Steelhead trout but rather a Potamodromous. Truly migratory fishes whose migrations occur wholly within freshwater. (From [potamos], river ... ) . Steelhead, IMO, seems to be something that the steeheaders use to make themselves sound more ..."
679128,Twocoda,2012-03-24 02:11:00,4130,Ontario Steelheaders Association or Ontario Rainbow Association ? Real question is.....whats a freakin Atlantic salmon caught in the tribs of Ontario
679131,bow slayer,2012-03-24 02:23:00,1074,my understanding is the rainbow trout that have been stocked in the great lakes were steelhead(migratory sea run)west coast fish and have develop the same characteristics in the great lakes(migratory) so are called steelhead. I also read recently that they are more  closely related to pacific salmon then first thought and actually might be better catagorized as such.
679132,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-24 02:24:00,2690, BINGO!
679133,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-24 02:25:00,2690,  Other than up at the Soo...a pipe dream.
679137,blaque,2012-03-24 02:40:00,2419, I for one couldn't  care less what they're called. Let's change the name.....you call it
679154,BillM,2012-03-24 03:11:00,17367," 4th Sat Dave, lol!!  I definitely won't be fishing 'steelhead' on opener.. All residents for me (brookies, browns, rainbows, etc)"
679163,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-24 03:24:00,10439," HAHAHA, been away too long. We don't have closed seasons up here."
679242,Spiel,2012-03-24 12:39:00,9065,"So am I building you a Rainbow rod or  a Steelhead rod Brian, I need to know before I get started."
679253,solopaddler,2012-03-24 12:57:00,8605,"    Well, not exactly. Anadromus refers to fish that live in the salt and run fresh water rivers to spawn.  Technically our fish are potanadromous, look it up.  As far as steelhead vs rainbow trout, most of our naturally reproducing ""steelhead"" have genetic roots that can be traced back to a variety of different west coast strains of anadromous steelhead.  Genetically they're identical. They have adapted over generations to life in the great lakes, remain migratory, but have timed their spawning runs to best suit our climate and the water temps and levels encountered.  Based on genetics alone and the fact that these fish exhibit a similar life history I have zero problems calling them steelhead.  There are some notable exceptions, a prime example being the mutts that the State of Pennsylvania stocks by the millions into their streams. Their closest relatives are in the fish tanks at Fortinos LOL!  Rest assured Brian, the river that you fish has runs of what I'd consider to be true steelhead."
679256,aniceguy,2012-03-24 13:03:00,1094,A steelhead and a rainbow are exactly the same no difference nadda zip zero. Tomatoe tomato same fruit diferent name.
679270,solopaddler,2012-03-24 13:51:00,8605," Technically yes, they're genetically the same fish.  But wild west coast strains have evolved an anadromous lifestyle and are genetically ""preprogrammed"" to be migratory.  Also the specific west coast strains that have been stocked in the great lakes exhibit noticable physical differences between inland non migratory rainbows, ie, they're longer and leaner."
679306,misfish,2012-03-24 15:11:00,29133,"    They are strong fish. We didnt find out today though.It was a total blow out.Didnt think we got that much rain to do that.Ryan checked the site, and it went from great all week and spiked right to the top on the chart over night."
679368,BillM,2012-03-24 17:26:00,17367,"Brian the river has been garbage all week man, I drive over it everyday.  You didn't miss out on anything, trust me."
679374,12footspringbok,2012-03-24 17:41:00,459, Actually it looked pretty decent wednesday thursday... I drive over it in 2 spots 25 kms apart everyday.   I'm not into fishing the rivers in the spring though.  Brian they will always be 'bows to me. Although I have been referring to them as steelhead ever since I got my pin last fall.
679384,davey buoy,2012-03-24 18:15:00,5505,"Pretty soon we'll be asking the difference between walleye and pickerel?,That'll be equally interesting I would think.Was that a CAN/USA name difference?."
679393,Terry,2012-03-24 19:01:00,14456,too late it was brought up in the very first reply
679402,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-24 19:33:00,10439, This ones easy!!!!    :tease:  Walleye    Pickeral  
679407,Terry,2012-03-24 19:45:00,14456,yeah but he didn't type pickeral he typed pickerel and I am pretty sure he mean yellow pickerel so try again
679412,davey buoy,2012-03-24 19:51:00,5505," The two fish shown are night and day different,I'm not sure of the proper spelling,but I thought they were one of the same fish,or very,very close in appearance."
679414,Fisherman,2012-03-24 19:53:00,7201," Hahahaha, how 'bout steelbow or a rainhead."
679419,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-24 20:01:00,10439,  I know Terry. I'm just having a little fun.
679423,Terry,2012-03-24 20:05:00,14456,me too   LOL
678995,misfish,2012-03-23 21:38:00,29133,"When does a steelhead,become a rainbow,or visa versa?  It,s always been rainbows to me.Ya we call them steel,chomers,silver bullets in the fall and winter.  I,m fishing the riv this weekend ,and it,s spring time,and to me ,it,s rainbows.  Did I catch a rainbow,or a steelhead?"
678996,Terry,2012-03-23 21:45:00,14456,"I thought steelheads were searun fish that came up the fresh water rivers and if that's the case in Ontario, I would think we never have steelhead so I guess it should be like pickerel wrong word it's only walleye, if you listen to the know it alls"
678998,misfish,2012-03-23 21:48:00,29133," Thats what I thought aswell. Maybe it,s just a slang word given to the fall run."
679000,Live2fish85,2012-03-23 21:48:00,1633, Thats what I have read as well. Probably because it sounds better.
679001,Sinker,2012-03-23 21:50:00,8692,"Terry pretty much has it. A steelhead is a migratory rainbow. Whether they migrate from salt water, to freshwater, or freshwater to freshwater doesn't really matter.  Rainbows are what I call land-locked.  They are all 'bows to me, although the inland fish taste a lot better, and they're usually put and take, so bonking a few isn't hurting anything!  S."
679003,Terry,2012-03-23 21:56:00,14456,I think it's because   I fought a rainbow.....sounds GAY...........not that there's anything wrong with that   I fought a steelhead...sounds manly.........not that there's anything wrong with that    I'm just saying
679004,Pikeslayer,2012-03-23 21:57:00,1443,
679005,Roy,2012-03-23 21:57:00,13728,"Rainbows will live out their lives in the stream, river or lake where they hatched. Steelhead, while genetically the same fish, are sea run or in the case of Ontario, lake run. These fish spend their lives in the Great Lakes and swim up the tribs to spawn. Steelhead get to be larger than rainbows and are generally more streamlined."
679007,misfish,2012-03-23 22:02:00,29133," So all those little clone guys I caught this fall /winter, were rainbow,thinking they were steelhead?"
679018,davey buoy,2012-03-23 22:22:00,5505," Yes!,no steel head in Ontario."
679019,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-23 22:25:00,10439,Steelhead are anadromous rainbow trout. This means they are a rainbow that migrates out of it's natal river to an ocean or large lake (Great Lakes) when it smolts. It lives it's life in the ocean or large lake and when mature it returns to it's natal stream to spawn. It returns to the ocean/lake after spawning to return (hopefully) yearly on these spawning runs.  A rainbow (non-steelhead) is one that does not drop out of it's natal stream into a large lake or ocean. It spends it's life in the river/stream it was born in.
679026,davey buoy,2012-03-23 22:31:00,5505," I was told,steel head are saltwater to freshwater to spawn,and they would never make it this far meaning it's cousins are rainbow,totally fresh water driven.Correct me if I'm wrong?Rainbow return to fresh water lakes as I was told."
679031,misfish,2012-03-23 22:36:00,29133,"  Now I,m confused.  A rainbow is a rainbow,but has two different names.A real rainbow is local to the river,but the other is a rainbow,that will live in a large body of water,then head to the river to spawn and head back to the big body of water,but given the name,steelhead.  Maybe my next report will be,,,,,,,,,,,,,   I caught a trout today."
679032,davey buoy,2012-03-23 22:39:00,5505, No steel head in southern Ontario apparently Brian. Italo said so :whistling:Just saying.
679040,Paulus,2012-03-23 22:53:00,522," Technically, Lake O rainbows are just that, rainbow trout - because they don't leave salt water to go to fresh water. I've seen this defined elsewhere but can't remember.  The only problem with this definition is that there is no real precedent for the great lakes - especially Lake Ontario which is unique (blue zone).  So, because of that, you can call them basically anything you want.  So... if Steelhead sounds cooler than Rainbow...  p.-"
679042,gaspumper,2012-03-23 22:55:00,393,Could you imagine the stream fishermen with there 13ft rods and CENTER PIN reels saying they caught rainbows.
679043,davey buoy,2012-03-23 22:59:00,5505,What a difference a name makes !
679053,BillM,2012-03-23 23:08:00,17367,"Steelhead live in the lake, spawn in the rivers..   Rainbows live in the rivers, spawn in the rivers.  At least that's my view on things.. Rainbows = resident fish, steelhead = lake run fish."
679055,misfish,2012-03-23 23:11:00,29133, I have no problem saying that.  Ya.I am one.
679056,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-23 23:14:00,10439, Actually I catch very few steelhead now. But every fall I catch tons of rainbows and occasionally a steelhead or two. Here's one of those little rainbows I chase after.  
679057,misfish,2012-03-23 23:15:00,29133," So those that fish the opener,are really fishing steelhead,not rainbows? So the wording ""Rainbow opening weekend"", is wrong"""
679058,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-23 23:17:00,10439, Not necessarily. There are lots of places that open on the 3rd Saturday in April that have regular rainbows in them.
679059,davey buoy,2012-03-23 23:18:00,5505,Now you tell me what man or woman wouldn't be proud holding that fish(rainbow)I sure would be.I'd call it whatever it wanted to be called.lol.
679060,misfish,2012-03-23 23:19:00,29133,  Beauty.
679076,Joeytier,2012-03-23 23:49:00,3990,They're the same species...steelhead is a term used to describe rainbow trout that migrate to spawn.  Seems like a pretty basic concept...?
