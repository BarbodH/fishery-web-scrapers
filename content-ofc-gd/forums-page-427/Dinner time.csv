Well,not to travel,but to get them from the state side. He was so right.

680026,bigbuck,2012-03-26 00:28:00,2449,I did some back ribs tonight as well with a really nice dry rub I put together and they were nice. You don't want to know what goes into your meat these days. The mass production and super farms and slaughter houses are ridiculous.
