678838,Float Buddha,2012-03-23 15:57:00,20,"  Hi everybody, I've been a lurker on the board for a while so I thought It was about time I should register an account.I love fishing or all species but carp are probably my favourite. I usually float fish if the conditions allow it and I'm interested in European and Asian fishing techniques. I picked the name ""Float Buddha"" because I spend a lot of time meditating on my float, not because of my ""robust"" physique.  The above pic is from yesterdays session at one of my local spots. I don't know what's up but this year it's producing much better quality perch than I've seen in years."
