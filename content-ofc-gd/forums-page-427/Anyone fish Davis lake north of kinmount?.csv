Ofcourse i want to bring the boat  How is davis lake? hes not a fisherman, so all he said to me was there a couple bass in  the lake..lol  Anything decent to fish for in May or best bet to try gull/head/4 mile or even balsam instead.   Thanks!"
678839,GBW,2012-03-23 16:00:00,8460,"he's correct, lol.  that's all I have ever caught there and and old friends folks live on the lake and have been there for years.  there could be more in there but I couldn't tell you; as like I said, all we ever got was bass."
678841,bigugli,2012-03-23 16:06:00,6138,"A lot of lakes in the area heavily populated with bass, bass, and more bass."
678878,dave524,2012-03-23 17:47:00,4508,"May , too early for bass, you mentioned Gull? even if you don't want to deal with the boat , I've produced both Lakers and Rainbows from shore working the outflow of the Gull R. into the lake on the north end that time of year over the years."
678897,adempsey,2012-03-23 18:10:00,1498,"If you believe Fish-Online, it indicates Lake Trout, Bass and Perch.  The MNR regs have exceptions for lake trout on Davis as well, so maybe there's some in there still."
678928,cityfisher,2012-03-23 19:17:00,959,Thanks all! looks like ill either leave the boat at home or try a differnt lake in the area
679086,chris.brock,2012-03-24 00:14:00,4053,"Davis Lk once had a naturally reproducing lake trout population but I haven't heard about anyone fishing for them. In May, I guess you could try for lakers in Davis, or nearby, splake in Buller, rainbows in Cedar or lakers in Gull. There's some brookies in Crego creek too."
679088,chris.brock,2012-03-24 00:16:00,4053,"rainbows eh, from the inflow in Sandy Bay or the outflow by Moores Falls? I'm guessing Sandy Bay."
679109,GBW,2012-03-24 01:29:00,8460,"head lake is your best bet for smb, walleye and musky if you want in that short treck."
679124,dave524,2012-03-24 01:57:00,4508," yes, Sandy Bay , where the Gull River flows into Gull Lake. Cast upstream into the river and drift your bait or lure in the current that extends into the lake.  Edit: I believe the bows actually run that river up to the dam in Minden much like steelhead in the Great Lakes."
