679731,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-03-25 13:23:00,1362,Awesome job troubleshooting and fixing that probem Lew!!  Glad to see that you'll be able to blow your horn this season
679732,lew,2012-03-25 13:25:00,12766, I've been blowing my own horn for years Steve
679735,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-25 13:41:00,10439,Lew Those pins insde the plugs are only held in with 2 little tabs and are easily bent if the wires are tugged on. Or the tabs may have been bent in when it was assembled so the didn't have a good hold on the area in the plastic housing they clip into.  By the way my dash looked like yours before I rebuilt it.
679736,Tybo,2012-03-25 13:41:00,1373, The cabling in boats is  a mess do to the same harness is used but the boat are different lengths. This creates the look of to much cable and not all use.For the cables are already there for options.
679881,misfish,2012-03-25 19:19:00,29133, Not sure I be saying that on an open forum bud.
679600,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 01:15:00,4661,its amazing how complicated they make it...   that wiring looks overcomplicated to me for boat electronics...  all those plugs and harnesses...   glad you got her figured out Lew...
679605,irishfield,2012-03-25 01:18:00,26272,"Always something stupid Lew... glad you got it figured out. Mine was too much plastic.. not enough throw... in the switch and after some trimming of the rocker it worked fine.  MMike.. what's complicated.. one quick harness for speedy boat assembly. Keeps the costs down, that many of us whine about."
679612,vinnimon,2012-03-25 01:30:00,2593,"  My thought exactly as roy meantioned. And another thing many people forget and I do as well. Did you properly check for ground at the horn. Or evern a continuity test on the ground wire. One thing I have come across with switchs like the one you postes, while undoing the nut, the switch tends to twist or turn, unknowingly aa wire can be pulled from a but connector with shrink tubing on it, and never realizing it.  One other thing I have come across with that same type of switch, in which i do have one. Is that its a factory screw up. Mine has a red button and was specifically purchased to cut the power off of a pup engine for a crane.  No blown fuse on your part so I see a bad ground."

679616,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 01:33:00,4661,  until you have to troubleshoot something  i prefer having a terminal strip with a power supply and 2 wires a red and black... one piece wire all the way to the electronic equipment... with a fuse depending on the equipment...  very few connections... at the power and at the equipment...  but im a big guy and dont like twisting into tight places and standing on my head with a flashlight trying to figure out what harness broke...  but thats just me... i like things the easy way....

679638,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-25 02:10:00,10439, I rewired my Fisher as well. Instead of having wires all over the place behind my helm I now have 2 bus bars for + & - and all the fuses are accessible from the front of the console (they are located under the cover of my switch panel). I also installed 2 quick disconnects for the dash wiring so that dash removal is simple for any work that may need to be done in the future.    The cover on the switch panel pops off to reveal the fuses.    :good:  
679646,mrpike,2012-03-25 02:15:00,151,HI LEW   BOTH of the wires are the same colour .   There for the wires are ethere hot with power  or no power cold for ground. THE switch only closes the ciruit. its the same as if you put the two wires togethere. my guess is they are cold ground wires and are working a relay switch back under the dash. if you put power to them you will damage the relay.. so don't put power to them.  if you put power to a ground relay it will weld its self closed and say closed some times if the power is to much.   There is no doubt that the switch is just closeing the ciruit. BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE THE SAME COLOUR. I hope this will help you out SIR.
679651,Tybo,2012-03-25 02:26:00,1373, Forgot one Dan.Stuck in traffic. I`m going to shove that thing up where the sun doesn`t shine if you keep blowing it.

679695,lew,2012-03-25 09:48:00,12766," Great job on the rewire Dave, you appear to have as many gauges & switches as my boat but with only a fraction of the wires.  I think the boat manufacturers could take a lesson from you.  The square white disconnect plug in the bottom left of your picture is where my problem was. One of the wires coming from the switch pulled out of the plug just a tiny bit but the way it was situated I couldn't see it until I pulled it apart and turned it around."
679713,bigbuck,2012-03-25 12:36:00,2449,Good work Lew!! Checking connections is always the first thing to look at.
678948,lew,2012-03-23 19:58:00,12766,"The fuses are the push-in type with the wire running thru them and from what I can see their all OK.  I broke my tester awhile ago RG but we're heading into town for dinner shortly so I'm gonna pick up another one.  That's the fuse panel just to the left of center and up a bit.  Paul, I'm gonna pull every fuse again tomorrow and take another very close look at them, but I honestly don't think I did anything to blow one.  All the  lights in the boat work fine as do the gas guages and the VHF radio.    This is the maze of wires I'm sorting thru and it's FAR more confusing that what it appears here.    The 2 orange & white wires at the horn switch    And this is the horn with one orange & white wire on one terminal and a black on the other terminal.    I'm gonna take a break from this now & take another shot at it tomorrow morning when my eyes stop being crossed from tracing wires all day.  Appreciate everyones help on this."
678952,aplumma,2012-03-23 20:01:00,6896,Lew take the meter and go from ground to each of both of the wires one of them needs to give you 12 volts. That is the feed wire. If you do not have 12 volts to either wire then you have no power to the switch. Run a wire from the hot side of the battery to each of the wires one side of it should honk the horn. Take that wire and hook it to the switch. Then take the hot wire and put it to the other side of the switch. Push the switch and it will honk. If the statements are all true then you have lost power between the input of the switch and the fuse block. Find the fuse block and pull the fuse. Go from ground to the fuse block one side should read hot. If it does and it is the one for the horn then the fuse holder is damaged if the fuse reads good. You can call me if you want I will P.M. you my phone # .    Art
678978,esoxansteel,2012-03-23 20:54:00,1307,"I stay away from offering idvice on electrical issues, for one good reason, im a shock or fire lookin for a place to happen, but you Lew would be a good man to put the fire out, dont worry about the horn it will scare the muskies away anyways, a couple of good profanities will get there attention."
679045,GbayGiant,2012-03-23 22:59:00,1780,Find out which(white and orange) wire is your power with a tester. The other will be your switch leg. Test for continuity on your switch leg of the circut. It will be one of the wires which has the bad connection. It is not as hard as it sounds or confusing.
679093,Dondorfish,2012-03-24 00:41:00,1000,Check both orange and white wires at the switch - if you have 12 volts at both wires - one is for the horn - and the other is for the light in the original  switch. This happened to me before.  Tracker ( Don )
679113,Jigger,2012-03-24 01:33:00,1237,Screams and whistles work on my lake lew!
679197,icceman,2012-03-24 08:57:00,36,"It should be a simple repair.  horn wires are postive and negative. the switch runs 12v to switch follwed by either orange or white wire.  My guess orange being + and white being your ground.  Run the other horn wire white, dirrectly to your ground bus bar or just try it directly to the ground side of the battery.  To try horn attach directly to a 12v battery.  The way you put wires on will not affect horn.  If they are put on backwards changes direction of cone in horn.  If you have any more issues feel free to pm me.  I work as licensed truck mechanic so i feel i am giving you the proper answer.  Hope this helps.  My link"
679200,Skipper D,2012-03-24 10:03:00,1970,Well did you get to blow your horn this morning Lew ?
679204,RSF,2012-03-24 10:28:00,47,"One of three things. First: I'd check the battery connections at the fuse box and if equipped, the main fuse at the battery. If in doubt--change them. When your sure there is power to the dashboard fuse box, again suggest touching (shorting) the two terminal clips together that attach to the horn switch using a screwdriver, horn should sound.  If not, the switch is fine and you will need to follow the leads to the fuse box and Replace the fuse and while doing so look for corrosion, try shorting the two terminals to each other again, it should sound. If not, The relay's the culprit or connections at the horn. Very bizarre you say it worked before removing the rotory horm switch and not after hooking in the pulse button. I'll assume the rotary original had Only Two connectors attached."
679215,Fisherman,2012-03-24 11:29:00,7201," Go back and look at the pictures, the or/wh (orange/white stripe)wire goes to either side of the switch, it's positive.  The other wire to the horn is black as per the picture, it's negative.  Mechanic eh."
679220,icceman,2012-03-24 11:46:00,36,the picture was for illustartion purposes only.  I do not need somebody questioning my abilities as the goverment was the one to give me an interprovincial license.
679225,Fisherman,2012-03-24 11:57:00,7201,"The pictures come from his boat, the or/wh is positive so I really don't know how you can get a positive and negative out of one wire that goes into and out of a simple switch.  The negative is the black wire as shown in the horn picture."
679227,icceman,2012-03-24 12:06:00,36,The pictures that where posted i can not see.  Thus i retract what i have said.  Just explaining from systems i have worked on. sorry steve
679229,lew,2012-03-24 12:09:00,12766,"Morning fellas and yes, those pictures are from my boat.  The 2 wires on the switch are both orange & white.  There's 1 orange & white on the horn plus 1 black wire.  Am I correct in assuming 1 orange and white comes from the fuse block to the switch, then the other orange & white goes from the switch to the horn and then the black comes from the horn and goes to ground ??  Is the ground on the fuse block or would it be somewhere else ??  I'm just trying to eliminate tracing more wires than necessary."
679233,icceman,2012-03-24 12:16:00,36,sounds like you got it right to me
679234,icceman,2012-03-24 12:17:00,36,remember ground is never to body of boat it will be to battery.
679257,skeeter,2012-03-24 13:08:00,1907,"Some times the fuses are good, but they dont make a good connection in the fuse panel. Pull the fuse back out and see if there is any corrosion on the prongs at all. Then put it back in and wiggle it around."
679262,Tybo,2012-03-24 13:27:00,1373,"OK Lew.Trace the lines back from the horn.Since there is no ground at the switch,there is a good chance it has a relay in the circuit. If there is a relay there a strong chance the problem is in that area. There also the chance that when you where moving the wires around that the strands broke down and you no longer cane get enough amps threw. The ground will go to a common buses bar most likely on the fuss panel"
679266,Tybo,2012-03-24 13:34:00,1373,Off track. Whats the proper name for a electric horn.
679279,Jer,2012-03-24 14:09:00,1426,"   Sound engine? Wait, it's electric...must be sound motor."
679313,lew,2012-03-24 15:27:00,12766,"Well, I finally got the horn problem solved.  I broke my test light awhile back so I had to get a new one and once I had the light it didn't take too long to figure things out.  I pulled both leads off the switch and with the test light I found I had power to one of them so that eliminated a blown fuse. I ran a wire from the live lead up to the horn and when I touched the wire to the horn connection it sounded.     As was suggested many times here it looked like a bad connection somewhere so I started checking everything again.  All the wires for the dash switches come from the fuse block and go into a plastic plug. The wires from the switches go into another plug and then to 2 plugs snap together. I pulled the plug apart and everything seemed good but on the outside I could see one of the horn leads appeared to have pulled loose just a little bit. The end of the wire has a metal sleeve on it and I pushed it back in and tested it and the horn worked. I pushed the wire in tighter and wrapped it with tape to be sure it didn't come out again.    From the angle I was originally working I couldn't see the back of the plug but once I pulled it apart and turned it around   the problem became obvious.  I hooked up the new push button switch and got it installed thru the back of the dash.    And now everything is working just like it's sposed to.    What would normally be a very simple job that should have only taken me 10 minutes turned out to be a bit more confusing but now I'm back in business once again and the push button is much better than the old twist knob.  Thank you VERY much to everyone that offered suggestions both here and thru emails.  Your a good group !!"

679317,ecmilley,2012-03-24 15:35:00,2163,"good to see you got it figured out Lew, i imagine your gonna get the boat out now and catch some bait. Next time just call me, youngs point is a nice little drive from here when you want to play with your electrical system"
679320,lew,2012-03-24 15:38:00,12766," Appreciate the offer Ernie, but you know you don't need a reason to come over, your always welcome here."
679596,SirWhite,2012-03-25 01:09:00,210,  *Head nod*
678846,lew,2012-03-23 16:11:00,12766,"The horn button for my boat is a knob that you twist to the right to activate, which is something I don't like.    I decided to change it to a push button    The original has the clips that push onto the back of the switch    The new push button has the screws that you wrap the wires around and tighten down    Before I did anything this morning I tested the horn and it worked fine.  I then cut the clips from the original switch, and installed the wires on the screws on the new switch and  the horn wouldn't work. I then switched the wires around and it still wouldn't work.  I then put new clips on the wires and put them back on the original switch and now that doesn't work either.  The power switch is on and the fuse is fine, infact I even tried a new fuse and still nothing.  If it matters, both wires are orange & white.  Any thoughts ??"
678848,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 16:18:00,4661,well...  my next step if you have access to the horn would be to put alligator clamps from the connections on the horn directly to a battery to test the horn...  other then that... sounds like a strange situation lew....  do those orange and white wires go to a panel of some sorts... i had something similar happen to me with my lights... ended up being a corroded connection on the switch panel broke off.... just me playing with the wires was the straw that broke the camels back i guess...
678854,Spiel,2012-03-23 16:35:00,9065,Strange indeed Lew. Did you try connecting the 2 bare wires together to see if the horn sounded?
678855,bigbuck,2012-03-23 16:35:00,2449,"Try to see if the horn still works by doing what Bill said. Actually, before that, check the contacts to the horn to make sure one didn't come off while you were fiddling. If it works, then follow each wire to see where it goes and make sure it's connected. If you have a test light or voltage meter, make sure you have power. Good luck."
678860,workwear,2012-03-23 17:09:00,592,could be a defective switch
678861,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-23 17:09:00,10439,Those wires could very likely connect to a relay  that activaes the horn. Check to see that you didn't accidently pull any of the wires off the relay when you were working on connecting them to the new switch.
678862,lew,2012-03-23 17:10:00,12766,"All good suggestions guys and thanks, but all connections are clean and tight and I've already tried all your ideas. Actually I never even came close to any of the connections other than the ones right at the switch.  I tried your suggestion too Spiel and connected the 2 wires to each other but still nada.  If I didn't know better I'd think somehow I blew a fuse but it checks out OK and I've already tried different fuses there.  Oh well, I spose if anyone gets in my way this summer I'll just have to scream at them or blow my whistle  Thanks anyhoo boyz."
678864,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 17:15:00,4661,try replacing the horn with something else... maybe a light or something... if it works... your horn is no good....  only so many things that can be bad...horn...connections...broken wire...switch... powers supply...
678868,Skipper D,2012-03-23 17:19:00,1970,"Check the grounds , if it worked before it should work again .Tomorow morning at 3am it i'll work Lew ."
678872,jimmer,2012-03-23 17:34:00,2730,"I would agree with the person that said to connect the horn directly to the battery to see if it works, before going crazy over the wiring."
678875,NANUK,2012-03-23 17:46:00,797,Probably a blown fuse
678893,SirWhite,2012-03-23 18:02:00,210,The switch IS the relay. Its def got to be a loose connection. Your gonna have to follow the wiring and find where it came loose.
678904,lew,2012-03-23 18:26:00,12766,I hooked a battery directly to the horn and it works fine.  I've been under the dash for an hour checking connections and they all  seem to be tight and I've re-checked the fuses and everything appears good.  This is really bizarre because as I said above the only thing I did was take the wires off the back of the old switch and put them on the back of the new switch.  The entire job only took a couple minutes.  
678907,ecmilley,2012-03-23 18:36:00,2163,"Lew check all the fuses, if there is a relay in the circuit it could be on another fuse, is there a wiring diagram sticker anywhere? i have one in my bilge area that comes in handy for electrical gremlins also check for a connector off, many boats just have push on connectors that come loose easily"
678910,Roy,2012-03-23 18:38:00,13728,"Lew, does your ignition key need to be in ACC. or RUN position for these things to work? If you're hotwiring and it's working...well....??"
678912,kickingfrog,2012-03-23 18:39:00,8333,Have you tried the old/switch?  Edit: never mind
678914,Lip-ripper,2012-03-23 18:48:00,228,If the wire was really old and brittle the strands could have let go within the jacketing when you bent them to work on them. It would only show with a voltage tester.
678915,lew,2012-03-23 18:49:00,12766,"Ernie, there's no actual diagram for the fuse panel but everything is clearly marked on the fuse block including the fuse for the horn. I've checked them all earlier incase the relay is seperate but I'm gonna check them again.  Roy, the key doesn't need to be on but there's a seperate master switch on the dash but I had it in the correct position.  And Rob, yes I've tried with both the new & old switches.  It's no wonder auto mechanics are so well paid"
678916,danc,2012-03-23 18:51:00,4677,"I'm no expert on such things, but here's my guess. Did you install the switch back into the dash before trying it? Perhaps the dash is the ground??"
678917,lew,2012-03-23 18:51:00,12766," Sorry Trouty, we were both posting at the same time.  The boats only 3 years old and the wires don't seem to be the least bit brittle, but that was a good point."
678919,lew,2012-03-23 18:55:00,12766, No I didn't Dan as the dash is fiberglass with no metal at all near the switch and the old switch itself is a plastic housing  but that was one of my 1st thoughts this morning.  The new switch is metal but the neck that comes thru the dash is bigger than the old one so I'll need to ream the hole out to make it fit and I don't want to do that until I figure out the problem.
678926,Fisherman,2012-03-23 19:17:00,7201,"Okay, the horn works 100%, you tested it directly to the battery.  The only thing that switch does is close the circuit, just like a common light switch in a house.  Find out where the or/wh wire comes from under the dash and what it's hooked to for a power source. There's another wire on the other side of the horn, ( you need 2 to make it work) ones + the other -, I'm highly suspecting the or/wh is +positive.  Find out where the other wire from the horn goes, most likely a common ground point(buss bar) under the dash.  Somewhere under there is a failed connection, the actual connector may be tight however the wire is not making contact at the connector.  There's no other way around it."
678930,NANUK,2012-03-23 19:23:00,797,How did you check the fuse Lew ?
678932,RangerGuy,2012-03-23 19:32:00,564,Didn't read the all the post but maybe the button is no good. If you have meter that test connectivity you could confirm the button is closing the circuit?
678939,Tybo,2012-03-23 19:49:00,1373,"Lew,First check to see if any thing else is not working.The horn fuse will be for the horn not the switch, I think you have a main power fuse blown. Touching the two wires together should make the horn work. Two wires the same colour means power in power out.No ground at the switch."
