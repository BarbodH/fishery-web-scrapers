679222,skinny,2012-03-24 11:50:00,442,ok it's time to replace my ford f-150 what sites do you use????  what I need is to be able to pull my boat (16ft starcraft tiller) seat 4 be resonable on fuel (I drive 1/2hr each way to work)  and max cash I have is 3000.00  been looking on kijji with out very much luck I will travel to look at something real good
679273,Tybo,2012-03-24 14:01:00,1373,A truck for 3000.try the scrapers It`s going to be very damn old for that price.
679274,Sinker,2012-03-24 14:04:00,8692,Um....ya....your not going to get much for $3G.  I pull my 16 tiller with a subaru forester XT. No problem.  S.
679276,Nipfisher,2012-03-24 14:05:00,2449, Yep..if you are looking for another F150...mid 90s with LOTS of kms and not too good on fuel for $3000.    use the kijiji ontario search feature rather then just your area.
679285,Jer,2012-03-24 14:18:00,1426,$3000 might be better invested fixing what you have.
679302,bubbles,2012-03-24 15:03:00,591,  Yep
679436,skinny,2012-03-24 20:32:00,442,what i have is really beyond repair frame is getting bad and body is not great either I would love to have more cash to spend but it's not going to happen anytime quick. I'm also trying to dig out of a big hole created from not working (I am now)
679438,danbouck,2012-03-24 20:37:00,4380,"You guys must not look much. I am currently looking at an 04 escalade with 200,000 for 4k and know the full history. You will find an early 2000's truck or SUV for that, keep watching kijiji and be patient."
679443,Nipfisher,2012-03-24 20:43:00,2449,"  Dan, there is nothing wrong with a 1995-1998 F150 with 250,000+ kms. Skinny, you will find something for $3000."
679470,skinny,2012-03-24 21:46:00,442,just thought I mght get some other sites besides kijji to look thru doesn't need to be truck could be suv like jeep or others
679479,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-24 22:12:00,10439,You can also look on The Auto Trader Site as well.
679483,mikdor,2012-03-24 22:23:00,109,Don't pay any attention to the negative jerks on here. You know what you can afford and you will find a vehicle that will suit you not them.Good Luck mikdor
679489,danbouck,2012-03-24 22:45:00,4380,"Found ya a 98 Pathfinder, 99 Pathfinder, 97 suburban and a 2001 expedition   A buddy has a minivan in your price range too, let me know"
679495,Dan668,2012-03-24 22:52:00,1120,"Lots of stuff around, i bought a vehicle last year just to tow my new boat home. 2002 exploder limited with a 150k, new tires, brakes. safety, etest. Got it for under 5 grand, immaculate condition. Risky truck to buy, but ive had no problems so far (knock on wood). Look around, you'll find something."
679559,SBCregal,2012-03-25 00:28:00,688,if you consider an expedition make sure you take a good look at the rad support.  i've seen more than a few rotted out there
679570,vinnimon,2012-03-25 00:41:00,2593,"Tim im sure youll find something good at a reasonable price. Im sure you know your way around a vehicle, thats if it needs a few repairs. I spent a day or so looking on kajiji when I came across the jeep I now own. The new tires cost more than the vehicle, she runs great and its solid.  Dont blow off the cheapos until youve actually taken a good look at them. Or just P/u another truck like yours and use yours for parts."
