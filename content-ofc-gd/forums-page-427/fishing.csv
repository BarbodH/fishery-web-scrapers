679804,Snidley,2012-03-25 16:03:00,620,Catch and release makes it all work. Great report and fantastic fish. Do the Bass fight well under these circumstances?
679806,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 16:06:00,8333,Hate you soooo much.  Thanks for taking the time to post some photos.
679808,Dan668,2012-03-25 16:09:00,1120,Awesome. I'll remember this for the future. Would love to be bass fishing right now
679809,solopaddler,2012-03-25 16:10:00,8605,"Really outstanding report, thanks for taking the time."
679814,Roy,2012-03-25 16:30:00,13728,"Yes, that's an excellent report, thank you. A small portion of Champlain is in Quebec. Most border States have agreements of reciprocity as far as fishing permits go. I have always read that Champlain was consistently ranked in the top ten US bass destinations. It's a great lake. Thanks again for taking the time to post your report."

679944,Jigger,2012-03-25 22:09:00,1237,Is there a slow clap emoticon? Cause youd get one. Good showing for March!
679966,Live2fish85,2012-03-25 22:46:00,1633,"Awesome. Thanks for sharing, I can't wait for bass to open."
679986,msp,2012-03-25 23:16:00,1336,Very nice mixed bag report. A long ways away up here for bass. I may have to take you up on the offer for getting down there. I think a road trip is order !
679987,Christopheraaron,2012-03-25 23:19:00,3525," I'm stepping on to a train to vermont, by the way the answer is none of them, ontario don't grow bass that big!"
679989,Rod Caster,2012-03-25 23:21:00,5784,"Great, early start to bass season! You've made many people jealous... Congrats haha"
679990,Live2fish85,2012-03-25 23:21:00,1633,  lol Ontario has lots of bass that big and bigger.
679993,MCTFisher9120,2012-03-25 23:26:00,3761,"This is a nice surprise report, finally some real fish   Looked like a fun trip down south, tossing cranks and pitching jigs. Can't beat it in any conditions. Great catch's guys!  Thanks for the post,  MTBF"
679994,Live2fish85,2012-03-25 23:29:00,1633," I love bass fishing but I didn't see any musky,trout or salmon in here.  Again awesome report, thanks for sharing."

679998,Live2fish85,2012-03-25 23:35:00,1633,Yea I agree a hundred percent. Lake Erie grows some nice ones to. I have seen some 8lbs largies out of long point and lots of 5-6 pound smallies with the odd bigger one off some of the reefs in erie. A friend of mine got a 7 lbs states side on erie last weekend.

680005,Joeytier,2012-03-25 23:49:00,3990,"Nice going.  I wacked 6 or 7 pig largemouth on jerkbaits while pike fishing today...No pike to boot...  They obviously weren't spawning, and were smashing baits in 4-8 FOW.  I've never seen them so aggressive this early in the year."
680007,Live2fish85,2012-03-25 23:50:00,1633, Lol yea here in Ontario the money goes to the employees of the fisheries/mnr more then the fisheries lol. I think bass should be open all year here to for catch and release. As you stated it has been like that for awhile in the states and hasn't affected them in a negative way.
