Only a small area to cast(which got bigger as the evening wore on) and shared with a family of 4.   FOUND A PUDDLE TO CAST AT WITH MY BUDDY CLIFF      We got there at about 5pm and it wasn't until 6:20pm that Cliff got the first fish.....a massive 6"" walleye. I followed that with 3 exactly the same size and then Cliff got a nice keeper right at the end. Our guides were freezing up from around 6pm and there was a brutal wind the whole time we were there. BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!   AT LEAST WE AVOIDED THE SKUNK!      The family beside us were using slip bobbers to anchor in the current with no success. Cliff and i were using a floating jig with a couple of split shot 18"" up the line with a medium paced retrieve. The fish were small but very aggressive! Wont get out for 2 weeks now but the next outing will be in a boat...love it!"

679720,limeyangler,2012-03-25 13:01:00,5204," LOL...yup...tank! good news is they dont get too much smaller than that so the only way is up!  As for Spring....we are currently relapsing back to winter, its snowing outside as i write and thermometer is hovering around -7. Hopefully this kills all the blackflies! JK."
