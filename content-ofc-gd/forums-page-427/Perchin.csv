679611,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 01:28:00,4661,got out for a bit this morning for some perch... they were biting REALLY good... they were hitting everything we threw at em... all kinds of plastics... and the plastics were almost keeping up with the shiners...  however... the temps and the winds were a bit too much for me to fish perch... wet hands when its 3-4 degrees out and blowing 30+km/h sucks...  so we packed up after only an hour and a half of fishing with 25-30 keepers... no pigs...but nice fish...          so we decided to go give carp a try... we THOUGHT we would be warmer on shore...  nope  still cold and the fishing was really slow... only had one bite and saw one fish jump...  but we did manage to warm up a bit... we collected some dry grass and some dry wood and had a little fire on the bank...that warmed us up for a bit until the rain came...then we packed up and headed home...               so i guess its March again...lol
