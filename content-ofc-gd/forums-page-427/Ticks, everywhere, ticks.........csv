679497,nofish4me,2012-03-24 22:54:00,404,"Ran/Trained some dogs today, ticks are certainly out already. So, if you are out in the bush, beware. Of course, it's my dog in the lead. Not always the case. Hahaha "
679498,NAW,2012-03-24 22:55:00,4022,Thanks for the heads up!  Where you running/training hunting dogs?

679529,nofish4me,2012-03-24 23:37:00,404," Pull the trigger, corn already being planted south of Meaford. Go figure. Hope the deep freeze happens before it sprouts."
679534,GBW,2012-03-24 23:50:00,8460,my buddies dog had one pulled from it's jaw 2 days ago the size of an eraser on a pencil!
679599,Sinker,2012-03-25 01:12:00,8692,I've never seen a tick. Hopefully it stays that way!  S.
679603,Dave Bailey,2012-03-25 01:17:00,1641," I'm not so sure. Our two main insect PITAs, the mosquito and the blackfly, may be lower in numbers. Mosquitoes depend on standing pools of water to breed, but with very little snow there won't be many patches of that. And blackflies depend upon swift flowing clear water from snowmelt runoff, seems to me that there won't be a lot of that either. I may be wrong, but I guess only time will tell."
679604,Dave Bailey,2012-03-25 01:18:00,1641,"Oops, double post."
