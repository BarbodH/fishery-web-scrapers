678608,southpaw24,2012-03-22 20:52:00,32,Hey guys been a while since Ive been on here. I'll cut to the point though.  My brother in law has a pond thats about 20 feet wide 5o' long and 15-20 foot at the deepest point. Its spring fed and keeps pretty cool all summer. He's wanting to stock it with some rainbows or rock bass something that will thin out the frog population there.  Does anyone know any places in Grey/Bruce to buy some stock? The closest I found searching online was Primrose.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks

679029,soggey,2012-03-23 22:35:00,20,"If you are in the Hanover area give us a call we can help you out. We have a variety of sizes of Rainbows. We package in large poly bags with O2 or can deliver larger orders. The fish in bags method can travel up to 2hrs away but have seen them last even longer than that. Or if Allan Park is closer for you, try giving Jim Taylor at Cedar Crest Trout Farm a call- 519-364-7803 he would be glad to help you out.  Hope this helps, Shawn Blue Spring Trout Farms, ltd Hanover Ontario 519-364-5592  Fyi: Hatten fish farm is no longer in business."
