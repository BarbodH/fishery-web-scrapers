679947,JustinHoffman,2012-03-25 22:11:00,482,"Hello All,  Came across these three toms...and on-the-fence hens...yesterday morning on my way home from work. Always cool to watch the interaction between these guys and gals once spring rolls around.         Cheers,  Justin"
679950,misfish,2012-03-25 22:20:00,29133,"ANOTHER DESK TOP PIC.  Very nice shots Justin.  My trigger finger,is getting itchy."
679954,JustinHoffman,2012-03-25 22:24:00,482,"Hey Brian,  Had a feeling these pics would get you pumped up!   Unfortunately, it was a private lane to a farm, so I couldn't get as close as I wanted to for a better shot.  On my way home this morning, I saw upwards of 8 toms and a dozen or two hens. Sadly, it was in a field at the side of the 417. Stopping to take a shot wasn't an option  Good luck on the opener, bud.  Cheers,  Justin"
679956,richyb,2012-03-25 22:26:00,774,Those be toms      sweet pics
679958,trapshooter,2012-03-25 22:30:00,1234,"Yeah, those 3 are TOMS!  Aka Longbeards, jelly heads, strutters.  They be running the show.  If a Jake (1 yr old male) dared to display/strut around those toms he'd get an a$$-kicking!  Ah, I see you made the edit.  Great pics Justin!!"
679959,JustinHoffman,2012-03-25 22:34:00,482,"Ooops! Thanks, RichyB! Not sure why I put in Jake. Just googled the two to ascertain their differences. Seems like the uniform tail feathers is a dead giveaway of it being a Tom as opposed to a Jake.  Good to know...a hunter I am not.  Cheers, Justin"
679961,JustinHoffman,2012-03-25 22:35:00,482,"Hey Ben - any idea what year Jakes become Toms?  Cheers,  Justin"
679962,richyb,2012-03-25 22:38:00,774,Their 2nd year they are toms.
679964,JustinHoffman,2012-03-25 22:42:00,482,"Thanks, RichyB. These birds didn't seem overly big compared to others I have seen, although I was a bit of a distance away. Would chances be they are ""young"" Toms - ie. 2nd year birds? Or do they look a full size to you guys that hunt?  Cheers,  Justin"
679965,trapshooter,2012-03-25 22:43:00,1234,"Yes, and you can tell jakes because of the uneven tail fan and they have short stubby little beards.  You can see those toms in your pictures have long beards 8-11"" usually.  If you're close enough too, Toms have long 3/4"" to 1.5"" spurs on their legs and Jakes just have little nubs for spurs.  The guys I hunt with... we do not shoot Jakes because they are going to be TOMS the next year!!"
679970,JustinHoffman,2012-03-25 22:55:00,482,"Thanks, Ben  Just found this link that offers some great facts and info on identification. I'm in the know now  http://www.nwtf.org/all_about_turkeys/new_turkey_look.html  Justin"
680027,NAW,2012-03-26 00:29:00,4022,I've noticed them strut'n in the of the local spots around Barrie.  There are actually quit a few flocks of Turkeys that live inside the City limits all year round.  At least 4 that I can think of.  They where on the strut all week across from where I work.
