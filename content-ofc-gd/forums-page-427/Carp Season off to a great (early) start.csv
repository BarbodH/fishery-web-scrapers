678715,Rod Caster,2012-03-23 02:12:00,5784,Beauty fish. It looks to be a Loooong soft water season this year. I wonder if we get any decent carp runs around here
678720,Pikeslayer,2012-03-23 02:19:00,1443,Nice Mike. Who put the lipstick on the fish?
678722,mercman,2012-03-23 02:21:00,7054,"Great report Mike. Zack looks right at home, and Ghislain was saying he is ""HOOKED"" deep for Carp now!!! Can't wait to get out with you again. Maybe after the wedding"
678732,The Urban Fisherman,2012-03-23 02:48:00,2050,"Way prettier fish then those god awful looking muskies you usually target! haha good work man - I'm a big fan of Carp fishing... don't get to do it as much as I'd like!  cheers, Ryan"

678738,spinnerbaitking,2012-03-23 02:58:00,1622,"Some nice looking fishies for March, what were they hitting Corn? Tight Lines SBK"
678781,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 12:22:00,4661,  Yup... Canned corn... Only 1-2 kernels... Keep it small early...  Also had some runs on a trimmed down boilie...  And one of the rods we were using method mix... The other just had the corn... And we put no freebies out....
678784,Harrison,2012-03-23 12:29:00,2202,Nice guitar pics there!  I'll take my lil one down to the bay this weekend and give it a go. Thanks for posting.
678790,Mike Pike,2012-03-23 12:53:00,1332,"Yup, this early spring( or summer? )has got the carp going earlier than last year.  An nice bonus for those of us who enjoy fishing for 'em.  Good job by you and your buds, Mike.  Nice, clean looking carp you guys hooked into there!  And a good tip about not over feeding yet."
678792,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 12:58:00,4661, yeaeh... right now your fishing for one bite at a time... your goal is that single bite... then if you get it... worry about the next bite... and so on...  but in a month... you wanna set the BUFFET for em... you'll wanna have multiple fish feeding at all times... and LOTS of bait going in steady all day....
678866,Float Buddha,2012-03-23 17:18:00,20,Nice healthy looking fish!
