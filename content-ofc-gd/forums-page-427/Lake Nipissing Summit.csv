The speakers are lined up and everything is pretty well nailed down,” Dwayne Nashkawa, band manager at Nipissing, said earlier this week.  The April 3-4 event is being held in the new Robert Surtees athletic centre at Nipissing University and there's no charge to participate.  Day 1 is mostly about setting the stage for discussion, with presenters describing the lake's history and how various groups benefit from it as a natural resource.  Estimates of the lake's economic value exceed $100 million annually, benefiting the surrounding communities.  “Day 2 is more of an inclusive-type setting, with a World Cafe session for a participatory discussion,” Nashkawa said.  “The format is designed to try to pull out common objectives that should form the basis for future planning . . . the aim is to get people more engaged.”  North Bay Mayor Al McDonald said he's looking forward to the discussions and that it's good opportunity for the surrounding municipalities to show leadership.  “It will give us a better understanding how we can protect this resource and how we can work together,” McDonald said. “It's incredible we can get every municipality to the table and agree it needs protecting.”  He said it's not all about the walleye fishery, noting that the health of the lake determines many other economic and social values.  “Imagine, we just spent $20 million on the waterfront,” McDonald said, noting it's a tourism draw.  “Imagine if Lake Nipissing wasn't healthy?”  Climate change and water quality issues such as recent outbreaks of blue-green algae will be discussed at the summit, as well as the effects of commercial and non-commercial fishing.
