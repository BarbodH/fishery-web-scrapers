678532,davis,2012-03-22 17:39:00,128,"I love my GoPro. Be nice to try the GoPro2, but the original does a fine job and I can't really justify the cost to upgrade.  I use it mainly while trail riding on the dirt bike (see  Keep in mind that you generally need a pretty beefed up computer to be able to even view the footage in HD. My 'older' computer couldn't handle the files - so I'd just hook up the GoPro straight to the plasma and watch there. It also meant that editing the files was impossible, and I'd have to convert them first to a format that my computer could handle."
678669,coreyhkh,2012-03-23 00:08:00,163,I ordered a underwater case with flat lens for underwater. I took some test footage around my house I was impressed with the low light performance. I get the new case and rod extension Tuesday caint wait.  this is the one I got http://www.eyeofmine.com/gopro/underwater/
678684,Terry,2012-03-23 00:43:00,14456,nice I will be buying the flat lens too
678699,Djeep,2012-03-23 01:22:00,199,"EDIT: didnt see the link above, thanks!  I usually use Imovie HD to edit, however, I have a friend who uses final cut pro x. Its a much better program for mac editing but very expensive!!  heres a video I made with the hero 2 and imovie HD, shot in 960 to reduce the fisheye effect. I need to work on my editing and getting the camera on a little quicker but let me know any other tips! Hopefully no one jumps on the location    Any recommendations for a cheap Mac editing program?"
678708,trapshooter,2012-03-23 01:50:00,1234,"There's quite a lot you can do with iMovie and for the price (free) I was very impressed.  Add music, text, photos, transitions etc.  It's easy to drop the level of the music for sections of your video where you want the original sound to come through.  But basically, it's the raw footage that you get that will make an impressive video.  I've edited 1h of raw footage to get 3.5 mins of action packed end product.  For me, iMovie is more then enough.  I will admit I have no experience with anything else.  Are the $$$ editing softwares really THAT much better for amature/youtube use??"
678713,Djeep,2012-03-23 02:07:00,199,"Perhaps I just need more practice with Imovie. I would like more transition options but youre certainly right for a free program it does work well, and its all for fun so I dont wanna spend any more consider the price of the go pro itself haha  the slow motion on final cut pro is much smoother and the exported video seems to be better quality but for $300 retail the program better do something!"
678759,fishindevil,2012-03-23 10:32:00,6254,"for those that have imovei !!! where do you download that from?? i just have tons of sledding video that i have not edited,so all you can hear is the sound of my yamaha sled !!! its awesome but it would be nice to add some music and to shorten some of the footage ??/ not sure how to do that any info would be great thanks ???"
678769,Djeep,2012-03-23 11:41:00,199,"Imovie is a mac only program that comes with mac computers, If you have a mac and its not installed, I believe you can get it here.  http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/imovieHD6.html  I just noticed theres Imovie 11 for 15 bucks Im downloading it to giver a try."
678772,Dondorfish,2012-03-23 12:02:00,1000,Just curious - what program do the ones that don't have a Mac use for editing?  Thanks Tracker (Don)
678818,Diltsy,2012-03-23 14:30:00,22, Windows also has a movie maker that comes with the OS. I believe it is called windows movie maker. It works on the same lines as iMovie.
678830,Terry,2012-03-23 15:24:00,14456,yup it should do the job but as stated before often you need to convert the video to a format that the program can handle lots of free and trial programs out there to convert them
677955,coreyhkh,2012-03-20 20:31:00,163,"Hey just wondering if anyone here has a Go Pro camera I am looking at getting one and using it for underwater videos, mounting to my boat for cool shots."
677961,fish_fishburn,2012-03-20 20:45:00,1311,"Go for it. They are awesome little cameras. Don't buy the cheaper cameras that are about 50 to 75 less. Cant remember the names of the others, but a few buddies have them and wish they had GoPro"
677969,danbouck,2012-03-20 21:20:00,4380,"I have a Kodak playsport and a GoPro, the Kodak is better in most cases but the GoPro is a good cam"
677971,Terry,2012-03-20 21:30:00,14456,"I will be buying the gopro 2 shortly I am waiting for the Wi-Fi BacPac and Wi-Fi Remote. to be available after seeing the great videos irishfield made with his, I had to have one  I have been trying to buy one on ebay o save some money but for some reason they have been bid up to more then I can walk into a store and buy one. plus they charge for shipping..why would anyone buy one for more money..don' get it"
677973,Roy,2012-03-20 21:45:00,13728,"I got a GoPro Hero on February 14th but I haven't been out with it...yet. Tons of accessory mounts and such to look at. Something else to do for this summer. And yeah, Kodak is officially out of the camera business. A hard blow to those of us who grew up calling a camera a Kodak. Hey Agnes! Fido's taking a dump, get the Kodak!"
677974,trapshooter,2012-03-20 21:50:00,1234,I have the GoPro HD Hero2 and love it.  Easy to use (there's only 2 buttons!) and so versatile with how it can be mounted + underwater.
677985,Curtisss,2012-03-20 22:55:00,25,x2 on the Playsport. I like leaving the fish-eyes to the fish.
678004,young_one,2012-03-20 23:50:00,620,"I've had my GoPro for over half a year. Lots of great footage from my fishing excursions. My computer harddrive is quickly running out of room with all the high definition videos.  I highly recommend the ""chesty"" (chest mount) and spare battery is a must. I have a 32G Class 10 SDHC on the device. I can record close to 6-7 hrs (720P quality) of non-stop videos with 2 batteries.  The wide-angle lens will capture more objects within the frame, but closeup subjects will look slightly distorted.  Here are some of my outings recorded with GoPro HD Hero:  Taken with the head mount   Taken with the chest mount   Taken with the head mount"
678005,Djeep,2012-03-20 23:50:00,199,"I have the hero 2 and its a great little camera, very versatile with burst pic modes and such. fish eye can be a little aggravating at times but the quality is awesome."
678025,bucktail,2012-03-21 00:33:00,1857,"Dont buy the original Go Pro if you find it on the net for sale. They dont service them anymore, youll get an optin for some money to get a go pro2. It is awesome. I have the video of my big muskie from last summer on it somewhere.  Remeber the go pro2 has a display which really is needed so you can edit on the fly."
678078,Djeep,2012-03-21 02:22:00,199,"My go pro 2 did not come with a display, it is an extra option. A rather pricey one at around $100 I believe. Would certainly come in handy but will have to wait till next year with the gas prices."
678079,Quebec kid,2012-03-21 02:22:00,2,"Go pro's are awsome little cam's we use one for POV (point of view) shots and uderwater footage. Some better cams are on the market for the price range but GoPro is easy to use and has a TONE of accessories.  Here is a vid mostly shot with go pro, but dont confuse the shots with the T3i https://vimeo.com/38384860  this is kinda of a cool mount for edits, made with the ""handle bar mount"" (sorry not HD)  "
678081,Djeep,2012-03-21 02:29:00,199,"pretty cool steelheading vid, see some of my stomping grounds in there lol what program do you use to edit quebec kid?"
678112,fishindevil,2012-03-21 10:16:00,6254,i have the gopro2 and i have taken tons of video all winter snowmobiling its awesome !!!! cant wait to use it for fishing and mount it on my boat as well !!! worth every penny !!!!
678118,Quebec kid,2012-03-21 11:05:00,2," Adobe, let me check the version"
678143,cityfisher,2012-03-21 13:13:00,959,anyone recommend where to get the gopro2 at a decent price?
678159,Terry,2012-03-21 14:19:00,14456,  you can buy from the US and get it for 300 bucks but then shipping and what not  350.00 seems to be the going price futureshop bestbuy henerys if it goes on sale anywhere I wil be all over it
678165,fishindevil,2012-03-21 14:34:00,6254,at christmas i got my gopro 2 at royal distributing for 299.00 so keep your eyes open they do come on sale !!!!
678169,GBW,2012-03-21 15:00:00,8460,I got the HD hero at Christmas for $189 I think at Future Shop.  So far so good but the GoPro CineForm Studio software keeps on crashing on me and have no clue what else to use to edit the videos.
678189,12footspringbok,2012-03-21 16:07:00,459,I don't have one but I'm really liking some of the videos of guys fishing that do have them.  Fishing shows without the Bull advertising.
678242,coreyhkh,2012-03-21 18:30:00,163,"Thanks guys I got one today, I had to go all over London to find it."
678265,GBW,2012-03-21 19:21:00,8460,so what are you going to use to edit the video footage?
678267,Terry,2012-03-21 19:26:00,14456,you have to convert to edit with most video editing programs
678271,GBW,2012-03-21 19:40:00,8460,"nope, I'm a walleye guy and not going to convert to the others unless walleye is closed for the season..."
678323,Diltsy,2012-03-21 22:41:00,22,"My only complaint with the gopro is underwater. The footage is terrible. If you are looking to get a lot of under water shots you might want to look into an after market flat lens for the housing, though they are fairly expensive. If you search gopro focus fix or gopro blur fix on  youtube you will find some DIY videos on how to fix the problem as well as before and after clips. Other than that I love the camera and can't wait to put it to use this summer!"
