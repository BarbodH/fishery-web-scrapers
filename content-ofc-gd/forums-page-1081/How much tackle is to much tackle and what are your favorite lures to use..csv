162166,GbayGiant,2008-02-19 23:39:00,1780,"I do have a ton of stuff but lately been selling it just because I don't use it or need it anymore, I think over time every angler will find what there best at for me it's jigs. Jigs and spinners are pretty much all I use, or troll cranks, you can catch any species at any time with a jig and minnow or plastic is getting better with the scents and styles they have now. Rather than using 100's of techniques or switching it up all day I find it better to perfect a couple styles, basically I jig for everything other than musky and even musky sometimes, it just works. If I'm on a new area or lake I like to troll a crank or spinner just to find a potential hot spot then cast/jig.  Give me a box of various jigs and a mix of size in the baits, plastic or live and I'm good to go with 100% confidence, other than musky but that's a different ball game."
162177,Bernie,2008-02-20 00:08:00,3190,"Ha Ha Joe. I was just lucky! I have one tackle box and hardly ever take it with me. A few homemade jigs in a container and a box of worms is all thats required for the fishing I do. But those that fish for other species on different lakes I can see the need for a wide array of tackle. Now a good rod, reel and line is another story."
162196,walleyejigger,2008-02-20 00:45:00,876,"i don't have ALOT of tackle but i have quite a bit, and some of it i'll probably never use because i like my go to's too much and am afraid to try something different,  my favorites are  white jigs, (although i probably carry around a couple pounds worth of different ones) with live bait or pumpkinseed powergrubs  tenessee shad husky jerk  firetiger rap (i call it the clownfish)  a bomber (the color escapes me) white with dark green almost camo like  yellow go-getter   i'll try these things first and probably retry them before anything else"
162206,Mike the Pike,2008-02-20 01:19:00,3421, Ya I am a witness to Shawn's stuff man he sure has alot of lures.He had to show me his classic boat now me I had to buy one like him.Like Shawn I will always try and buy the new and latest gadget.MTP
162274,livinisfishin,2008-02-20 04:03:00,661,"haha ill have to show my girlfriend this topic that i honestly thought would not get any replies. Then she'll realize my huge collection of lures is necessary most times and that i dont ""have the most lures in the world"""
161976,Hawg Hunter,2008-02-19 16:09:00,204,":thumbsup_anim:  i agree with you all too much is not enough,my basement im told looks like a tackle store  ,i just can't help myself,like most of you i buy 2-3 of each,some i use and some i don't. my wife never says a word cause 28 years ago i said you know i could be in the strip clubs with my buddies spending this money  ,boy have i got a keeper lol.lol  Hawg Hunter"
161997,LeXXington,2008-02-19 16:54:00,1928,  In the end I wonder if the strippers might have been cheaper
161998,cranks bait,2008-02-19 16:59:00,721," They might have been cheaper, but from what I remember being told about the ""Pink Palace"" in Belleville, the lures are much prettier"
162108,mepps,2008-02-19 21:12:00,1301,"I've got a box deticated to spinner baits alone!  I have a fair amound of stuff, but I dont take it all with me when I fish. I'd say you have too much if you cant carry it all at once."
162117,capt bruce,2008-02-19 21:28:00,820,"""I'd say you have too much if you cant carry it all at once.  Guess I have too much . Stopped counting my rapalas when I got to 1000 , and I dont really like rappalas so you can guess how much stuff I have . I just go down to the fish room and fill up a box of stuff to use that day when I go fishing , and I have a few location boxes that I take i.e. A sucgog box a rice lake box etc. etc. Been buying lures for 30 years or so it all ands up ??"
