162016,Tybo,2008-02-19 18:12:00,1373,Good thing they work with computers and not on your car.
162018,ccmtcanada,2008-02-19 18:15:00,7971,"Love these clips.  Doesn't matter to me if they are staged or not....I think most of us, at one time or another has wanted to do what some of these people did....LOL."
162021,Gerritt,2008-02-19 18:18:00,6129,I am having one of those days myself Joe.....  G
162023,Tinman,2008-02-19 18:21:00,376,"man, that was great!"
162024,Headhunter,2008-02-19 18:22:00,5703,"Me to G... me to! Ever since we moved to this new location, we are having internet access problems. With virtually all our systems being internet based, it sure does start to get annoying as your trying to get things done! I may make the 2 block walk up to CTC and pick up a 10 pound sledge... may be the only thing that really understands how I really feel! HH"
162031,tschirk,2008-02-19 18:43:00,261,Computers and Software are big company conspiracies to build public dependence and frustration which in turn employ geeks like me and make tech companies wealthy!
162033,Headhunter,2008-02-19 18:46:00,5703,"Ted, my brother from a different mother! You are so right! Actually, about 15 years ago, a MIS Manager described computers to me this way; ""They are a black hole for money! The more money you pour in, the more money you need to run them"" I'd say that pretty much covers it! HH"
162057,irishfield,2008-02-19 19:25:00,26272,Guy showed up late today I bet as well Joe!  PM me your office number. Maybe we can grab lunch one day this week as a distraction for me/Leah. I do have your cell #...

162077,walleyejigger,2008-02-19 20:03:00,876,"awesome, that made my day.  love the older guy who throws his monitor over the back, when the boss shows up just keeps on typing, CLASSIC"
162154,Tarzan's Jane,2008-02-19 23:11:00,1183,Computers were meant for females...men's fingers are just too Big...and women are far more patient.  This is our traditional work ...  men need to get out and do more physical work.
162175,ccmtcanada,2008-02-20 00:05:00,7971,"I just showed my 5 yr old this video...she laughed and laughed...and then promptly said ""They were bad...they shouldn't get a treat later"" LOL"
162183,Guest lundboy,2008-02-20 00:25:00,0,I actually did the fire extinguisher one on somebody.  Except it was dry powder. Back in the day when smoking in the workplace included huge smelly cigars.  I did warn him twice before I did it though.  He just didn't believe I would do it.
162187,Deano,2008-02-20 00:32:00,767,Yeah loved the part where the guy throws the whole monitor back at the guy throwing paper planes

162216,tapout,2008-02-20 01:50:00,166,why did that guy have a sledge hammer at the office in the first place?  Paper weight?
162218,lazybum,2008-02-20 01:55:00,142,That was a good stress reliever  . I used to manage system implementations and people called them virtual hell.
162260,Mike the Pike,2008-02-20 03:37:00,3421,Wow that was good mind blowing dude
