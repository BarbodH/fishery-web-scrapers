161742,Bernie,2008-02-18 23:45:00,3190,"Went over to the showroom last Friday and seen some guys I haven't seen in town before. Overheard them talking, caught a couple of names as they were talking. Terry and Dan I think. But I caught one of the guys snooping around the engines. Not sure what he was up to but he looked kind of suspicious. I think I have seen his picture in the Post office. If anyone knows who he is let me know.          Seriously, it was really good to meet Terry for the first time and to have a quick chat with him, Dan and Wayne. We were all in somewhat of a rush to get going to each of our respective fishing trips.  Hopefully next time we will have more time to converse. Hope you had a good time too Guys!"
