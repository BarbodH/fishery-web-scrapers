My only problem is filleting the little buggers. That darn ""Y"" bone is a killer and I can never manage nice clean, boneless fillets. Any suggestions/help??  Thanx,  Meely"

I either cut them out after I take the skin off, or pull them out with  needle nose pliers if I leave the skin on for smoking.  Turn the  volume down a notch......the music is horrid!!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfiYbUSPnHg  Sinker"
