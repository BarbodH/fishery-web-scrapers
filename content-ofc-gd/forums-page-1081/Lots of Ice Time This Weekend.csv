161497,Mike the Pike,2008-02-18 02:10:00,3421,"Despite our long Cold and Snowfilled winter the wife and I felt it was time to go to Ottawa and finally Skate with our family on the world famous Rideau Canal.I know you Southern folks don't like the cold but its winter and we have to get out there and enjoy it and that is what we did.I must say I enjoyed every waking moment of winter this weekend.  Stay tuned the report ends with Fishing.  Well on with the Pics.  Before going skating we decided to go and see the many eyegrabbing sites at the Ottawa Winterlude Carnival.    My son Ryan was not amused with the Camera.   An ice ship.       So I took this shot for you Sens Fans.I have to ask you though who hired Big Foot and painted him red   A shot from above of the worlds largest skating rink .I think it is also the most crowded skating rink in the world.   Here is the family.Looking forward to skating later.       Amazing shot of a detailed dinosaur.Talented artists I must say you folks are skilled             Forget about putting on our skates in one of those shacks the line up alone would have takin hours so I quickly tied on the kids skates in record time bent over like the hunchback of Notredame.Now we were waiting for friends from Montreal and Ottawa.standing still when its cold is not good .The childrens feet started getting cold.So my ice fishin experience told me to bring lots of HOT Paws .So   Untie 2 kids skates slip in hand warmers in their skates retie skates stand up rub my aliling back and open another pair of hand warmers so that the soon to be teenager can have some in her mitts now I can't feel my fingers so Hell ya I whipped out some boody hand warmers So do we look cold .Can't wait to skate like Hell   Now you can tell we have skated we are all warmed up and our heart pumping circulation has warmed up our lower extremities.So why not pose for the family photo.  Now not to long after 1.5kms Robin my middle child says take out the hand warmers from my skates my feet are burning So back to the Hunchback bend over untie skates (Cramp in Back)Fishin Devil don't do this?........Pull hand warmers and off we for the love of my kids right    Now thats me on the left the guy who looks like the littlelest Hobo skating.All I was missing was the Squeegee.Yup the wife said we are not leaving the boots anywhere so 2 pairs of boots joined the water bottles in the back pack along with my boots dangling on the side not too long after my oldest daughter gives me her boots .So I got lots of exercise and lets not talk about my back.   After burning 50 000 calories it was time to try the world famous Beavertail UMMMMMMMM really tasty and sweet.     My favorite ice sculpture of the weekend.The Skeleton riding a Chopper.        That was our very enjoyable day in Ottawa at the Winterlude Carnival. I must say it was cold but worth the 2 hour drive from the South-Shore of Montreal. Nice way to kill off winter  I drove back home while the family slept and I prepared for ice fishing for Sunday.   The next day it was time for ice fishin and my Dad who looks good for almost 70 decided to get out and enjoy the day with Me ,GlennK my Son Ryan and Glen's son Andrew.  We rented a cozy Ice hut on the St.Lawrence river.    I can always coaunt on Dad to feed me so well    The fishing was slow and I think I could have used my friend Boudreau(Roy) to help us find the fish.   This is all we caught for the day. Now help me out here this was GlennK's tip up he bated the hook set up the tip up  I reeled in the fish cause I happened to walk by while HE pointed to the moving tip up Now He claims its our fish cause he pointed it out and it was his tip up.  I say I brought it in so I should get credit for this fish.  I have to say thanks to Glenn for keeping me away from the dreaded skunk Now Gleen will be adding to this in the mornin.I think his post count will be passing 5 So here is a pic of Glen posing with my fish.   Thanks Glenn for preventing me from the big Skunk.What a generous friend Eh   Three genarations fishing Grandpa(My Dad)Ryan my son and just me another pike day thanks to Glenn     Now GCD see what one can do with all that ice and snow.  What a great weekend folks hope you enjoyed the pics  Mike the Pike"

161504,Casey123,2008-02-18 02:33:00,461,Looks like a lot of fun; thanks for sharing the pictures.
161506,Rizzo,2008-02-18 02:40:00,4754,some incredible ice sculptures there!  Looks like the Rideau could use a Zamboni though.  Any rules about cracking out the auger and ice fishing the canal?
161508,Mike the Pike,2008-02-18 02:46:00,3421, I wanted to bring it on the ice Rizzo but the wife would have none of that.Oh well at least my Buddy gave me a Pike on a silver platter today
161510,Clampet,2008-02-18 02:50:00,1947,"Good report, Mike.  I used to live in Ottawa, and skated on the Rideau Canal back in the 80's."
161514,tbayboy,2008-02-18 03:10:00,1497,"Great report Mike, winterlude is something everyone should attend at least once."
161518,fishindevil,2008-02-18 03:37:00,6254,"Great family trip mike !!! man those ice carvings look incredible,and it sure looked fun skating on the famous rideau canal,i have been there as well,and nice fishing report as well,and at least you didnt get skunked right !!!...great scenery pics too...cheers bud"
161536,Tarzan's Jane,2008-02-18 08:48:00,1183,Great Report...loved the look on your daughter's face as you are tending to her.  But that ice shack is awesome...
161537,Greencoachdog,2008-02-18 10:05:00,8163,"Great report and pics Mike!!!  Ice sculptures are always beautiful and amazing! It looks like you make a great servant to your children  As far as the ice fishin' goes, give GlennK his damn fish back  You just did as you were told when you brought that fish up, nobody told you to claim it Skunk-Boy! You must really be desparate to try to claim somebody elses fish like that eh!  You can have all of my share of the snow, ice, and cold Mike! Glad you had a great time!"
161546,lew,2008-02-18 11:43:00,12767,"Thanks for that Mike, sounds like a fun weekend for everyone involved.  Diane and I were there last year about this time and same as you, it was incredibly cold but as long as your dressed for it, you can have plenty of fun.  I also had my 1st ever beavertail from that same shack in your pictures and must admit, it was even better than I'd heard  Good to hear your weekend went so well !!"
161548,Roy,2008-02-18 12:05:00,13728,You did good with the whole fambly Mike. Good on ya. Thanks for the great pics...the Rideau does look a little crowded.
161554,wgk36,2008-02-18 12:34:00,69,"Mike,  You are right.  This is definitely your fish.  I am just glad that I was able to draw you a roadmap to my tipup and donate this fish to your anti-skunk cause.  You are a good fishing partner, and even a better friend."
161556,Greencoachdog,2008-02-18 12:46:00,8163," That is very noble of you to donate that fish to Mike's Skunk cause Glenn, and that's what good friends are for!  How many other fish have you donated to this cause that we don't know about?  I've noticed he doesn't ever hardly catch fish unless he goes with you...."
161560,b2kptbo,2008-02-18 12:56:00,1505,"Just great Mike, thanks..."
161577,taper,2008-02-18 13:32:00,611,"I envy you, This is one great Canadian tourist attraction that I have wanted to see and so far I haven't made it. Maybe next year."
161589,ccmtcanada,2008-02-18 14:40:00,7971,Great stuff Mike!  Some pretty incredible pictures and it looks like it was a great family day out.  There was even fish in this report!! LOL.  Good on you to spend that quality time with the family....you're a good hubby and dad.

162197,johnnyb,2008-02-20 00:47:00,3413,Wow...beautiful pics of Winterlude....those are great memories to have...thanks for sharing!
162200,Bernie,2008-02-20 00:56:00,3190,Hey Mike. Great report! You are right about getting out and enjoying the winter rather than complaining about it. It's just hard sometimes to get off your butt when its freezing cold. Once you are out and about it's really a lot of fun.
162212,solopaddler,2008-02-20 01:30:00,8605,Mmmmm.....beavertails  .  Looks like a lot of fun Mike thanks for posting.
