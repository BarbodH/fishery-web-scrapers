162328,fishing n autograph,2008-02-20 12:23:00,2540,that was a good one...!!!!!!!!!!!!!
162342,pikehunter,2008-02-20 13:14:00,1659,That was funny. The bystanders just stood there and watched the cops run into the building without saying a word as to the fact the robbers were in the car.  Can you imagine what the guys in the car were thinking as the cops ran past them and they could just drive off?
162345,ccmtcanada,2008-02-20 13:19:00,7971,LOL...first thing that came to mind was it was a movie shoot with someone recording it with a cell phone.  Pretty hilarious either way though.
162347,Jer,2008-02-20 13:24:00,1426,Obviously staged...  ...you can see the cop cars down the street waiting til the robbers got in their car...
162349,pikehunter,2008-02-20 13:35:00,1659,"Yep, probably was staged Jer."
162393,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2008-02-20 15:20:00,39,BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW.IT IS A TV COMMERCIAL SO YES OBVIOUSLY STAGED
162551,tapout,2008-02-20 23:42:00,166,"Definitely staged for TV.  The cop cars are visible as Jer indicated and also if you listen carefully you can hear the director's voice on the megaphone.  Last two things I heard were, "" cops come out"" and then, ""cut, excellent"" .   Was funny though."
162564,tjsa,2008-02-21 00:07:00,1578,"It is a commercial for the car they are in. I cannot see the make, and cannot remember it either, but have seen it a few times on TV, with the video from a completely different angle. It was probably a member of the production company, or could have been a bystander watching the commercial be made, that posted the video. I haven't seen it in at least a month.  And, the poster to youtube did mention in the details about it being a ""spoof""."
