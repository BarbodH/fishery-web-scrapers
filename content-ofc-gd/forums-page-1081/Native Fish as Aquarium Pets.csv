162526,lovetofish,2008-02-20 22:16:00,500,"its a nice thought to have game fish in your aquarium at home, but unless you really know what your doing with aquarium.  Let the fish go or bring them home to eat.  If you don't know what your doing, your just wasting the fish.  Just my two cents.   lovetofish"
162542,Burtess,2008-02-20 23:04:00,901,"As some have said, it is illegal to transport live native sport fish without a permit, but it is legal to keep them, contributing to your keep limit.  It is a big no no to release them back into a body of water however!!!  And this includes the same body of water they were caught in.  Once they have been in your captivity, they must be euthanized if you no longer want them.  This is how disease etc. is spread, by releasing captive fish back into the ""wild"" waterways.  And unless you keep the darters or minnow families, you need a large tank just to keep a single fish of the sunfish (bass), or pike/muskie.  One sunfish in a 75gal tank is about maxed.  These fish can be more aggressive than large CA cichlids.  And said previously in this thread, ""keep ammonia levels on the low side"", is wrong....  In a cycled tank there should never be any measurable amount of ammonia (or nitrite) as it is immediately converted into nitrate, which is removed by large weekly water changes.  Remember, large fish, larger tanks!!!!  Burt"

I have had them for a year now with absolutely no problems. It's great to watch how they eat and to test techniques at home. Also my son will sit and watch them all night."
162550,David Chong,2008-02-20 23:40:00,836,"I have collected and delivered fish to BPS. I was required to have a special permit from the MNR in order to do this. BPS applied for it for us. Cheers, Dave"
162451,livinisfishin,2008-02-20 17:56:00,661,"well i have 1 largemouth and 1 sunfish in 38 gallon tank. They are 2-3 inches long and they are doing great in there. Im looking forward to getting a new tank when i move out that can hold100-150 gallons or more if i find the right deal.  I am also able to keep two small algae eaters in the tank. With the plants and the fish it looks real cool. Also the other week i had a minnow bucket with 7 minnows in it. The next couple days the weather got really cold, and froze the poor minnows into an icecube.  It stayed in my car frozed solid for four days or mroe, then the one day i pulled it out and the water was defrosted and had lost some of in my car cause the bucket ended up titled over   i looked at the water that was left and there was 4 dead minnows, i looked closer and there were 3 still swimming around alive  . Im wondering how thsi happened, ive heard of reptiles like frogs freezing ,defrosting and coming back to life, kinda like s state of hibernation. did this type of thing happen to my minnows or was there an air hold just big enough for my fish to stay alive in. From my experience the whole bucket freezes, no water is spared, its just like a giant icecube. Can somebody help explain how they lived?"
162453,fishinggeek,2008-02-20 17:59:00,325,I'll bet no one here had a permit to transport the fish!
162455,Terry,2008-02-20 18:07:00,14456,"I bet some people here have got the permit  and they took the fish with a permit to BPS and that's how I know about it, they had a thread about it some time ago it always gets me how most people on these boards assume everyone is guilty..oh well I guess that's life"
162457,fishinggeek,2008-02-20 18:16:00,325,"That sounds reasonable.  But a permit to transport fish to their backyard kiddie pool or basement aquarium?  That doesn't sound reasonable.  I could be wrong though.  In any event, I'm just making useless banter.  Never done it myself, but would've been cool to see a smallie eat a ciclid (sp)."
162459,kingjames_2nd,2008-02-20 18:22:00,72,"While trapping minnows I caught 1  rock bass and 2 sun fish,  all about 1  inch long.  I put them in  a  fish bowl with an aerator and watched them jump out a  coupe times.  so I place a lid on it and I could hear them clang against it trying to jump to freedom.  I let them go the next day feeling bad for them and dont plan to keep any more as pets...  except maybe a  large school of bait fish.  On a  larger scale it is my dream to buy some land excavate a  pond and stock it with X species.   Then we'll really have some pets to play with."
162467,Terry,2008-02-20 18:42:00,14456,"you might be right, but I think they are more interested in the fact that you are not putting them into another lake but a back yard swimming pool might be a pond in under the law and that needs another permit"
162471,fishinggeek,2008-02-20 18:57:00,325,So Rich now needs 2 permits????
162496,EC1,2008-02-20 20:26:00,930,"i used to have a smallmouth in my tank, it grew for a while...we fed it shrimp and nearing the time before it died we got it to jump out of the water and grab it out of our hands. fun times. but then i guess these fish werent meant for aquariums...."
