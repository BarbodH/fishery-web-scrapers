162651,pameladallaire,2008-02-21 04:16:00,470,"Here are mine from the first half, it got too cold after that.  Pam    "
162652,Bernie,2008-02-21 04:16:00,3190,"Don't be too hard on yourself there Dan. I like the shot. Its clear and its showing a planet and stars along with it. Cliff, those pics turned out pretty well all things considered.          Sunglasses. Ha Ha I tried with mine but needed a tripod, besides, Dans turned out so well I didn't need to take one."
162653,Kawartha Kev,2008-02-21 04:24:00,281,Great viewing of the eclipse here in Toronto here are my best shots with a point and shoot Nikon coolpix also. Biggest problem was the fact that the eclipse occurred so high in the sky that there is no real referance points. Oh well hope you enjoy the pics              Kawartha Kev
162664,Greencoachdog,2008-02-21 11:04:00,8163,Had this song playing in my head while viewing those pics:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tZIaapf2gU
162679,ccmtcanada,2008-02-21 12:17:00,7971, Great tune Glen!
162699,Crazyhook,2008-02-21 13:20:00,1154,"now the real question is, did anyone go out fishing last night?"
162702,dsn,2008-02-21 13:24:00,1018,"I knew this threat would come, So was ready to take some shots. I looked out the window around 10-10:30pm like they said on the weather network. I couldn't even find the moon it was so dark. I ended missing out. But I knew the folks here would have great shots like always.  Thanks for showing them  dsn"
162709,kennyman,2008-02-21 13:46:00,737,"Found a great video. Check it out  http://ca.video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=2...mp;fr=yfp-t-501 . Just think, somewhere somebody is shooting this in IMAX."
162715,douG,2008-02-21 14:12:00,2693,The two 'stars' visible around the moon last night were Saturn and Regulus.  Honest.
162718,Bernie,2008-02-21 14:25:00,3190,"douG, when I see Arcturus above the roof of my house before 10 PM its springtime."
162724,Roy,2008-02-21 14:49:00,13728,"And if you see Dwarfacus anywhere near your house, it's party time."
162737,cheese,2008-02-21 15:49:00,27,"Took the kids out for a drive .... picked up the hot chocolate and found a quiet road to sit and observe the eclipse. Driving down the round, I spot a familiar silhouette in the moonlight.... quick turnaround and drive back to shine lights on the fencepost.  A beautiful owl sitting patiently for his next meal with the eclipse as  a backdrop....NO CAMERA (don't think it would have turned out anyway). kids thought that was cool!!!"
162739,cthewrld,2008-02-21 16:01:00,99,One of my shots from last night 
162740,cthewrld,2008-02-21 16:03:00,99,One more .... although there are lots! 
162745,Bernie,2008-02-21 16:29:00,3190,I knew you wouldn't let me down Roy
162804,maybe,2008-02-21 19:09:00,307,"Don't think I've ever seen a pic of the moon mooning before.  Brilliant shot, michaelw!    :worthy:"
162486,Weeds,2008-02-20 19:47:00,782,"Hey, I know CC has got this posted in extra resources or anouncements but nobody reads that so I figured I'd post it here. Should be cool, look up around 8 and then every once in while after that. Let me know if it was cool cause I'm sure to forget. Maybe bump this too."
162493,ccmtcanada,2008-02-20 20:19:00,7971,Good call Weeds.  Looking forward to some great pics from the talented group here on OFC!  Don't miss this one folks...it's the last one until 2010...and this coming on a full moon...should be a real treat.
162494,Bernie,2008-02-20 20:21:00,3190,"Just so you know Cliff, it has to be on a full moon to have a lunar Eclipse. Being as how everything is lined up."
162497,ccmtcanada,2008-02-20 20:26:00,7971, LOL Bernie...details details....  I guess what I meant to say is that it's a total lunar eclipse instead of partial....yeah that's it....
162594,shane,2008-02-21 01:55:00,652,Our cats are starting to act weird.
162602,tapout,2008-02-21 02:10:00,166,"Just went out and had a glance.  Yep.  Perfect night for it.  Cloudless and cold.  It's started.  Also this is a very special milestone in the ""posts"" tally.  Weird this happens on a lunar eclipse!  If its an omen, ........."
162604,TJQ,2008-02-21 02:12:00,7806,Coll... happening right now!!!  Its 9:12
162605,steelhedrmatt,2008-02-21 02:13:00,278,almost half covered right now!!
162607,douG,2008-02-21 02:17:00,2693,"I just came in after a view with The LIttle One, and remarked on the two stars, one left and one up of the moon.  Chile said, ""Dad, that big one is likely a planet"".  So it is.  That is Saturn, and directly above is Regulus.  No poop."
162608,Daplumma,2008-02-21 02:17:00,1961,Wow Its even happening in Virginia!
162612,danc,2008-02-21 02:21:00,4677," This thread is about the lunar eclipse Joe, not the Obama vote."
162617,Joey,2008-02-21 02:44:00,9122,"Are you getting any pics Dan?  My camera does not have the capacity, I've tried several settings, and its basically a blur  Joey"
162619,tapout,2008-02-21 02:46:00,166,9:45   Almost fully covered.  My nephew said it looks weird.  lol
162620,tapout,2008-02-21 02:48:00,166,"  Hey joey. I'm getting it in several shots on my video camera with my phone in front for a few seconds before each ""stage"" to show the time each shot was taken. Now the moon is almost covered the camera focuses better.  Go give it a try."
162622,danc,2008-02-21 02:55:00,4677, Joey. The moon is a tough shot without a DSLR. I don't own one. I'd give it my best try if it wasn't so cold out. Why do these eclipses always occur when it's so cold out??
162625,Joey,2008-02-21 03:04:00,9122,"You got great pics last time Dan, don't give me that crap.  Get your float suit on and get out there buster  Joey"
162630,danc,2008-02-21 03:26:00,4677,I think I lost an earlobe like Wayne. But here's a quick attempt. Maybe I'll go back out with my higher zoom and see what I can get.   
162632,RobHall,2008-02-21 03:31:00,261," Awesome shot DanC.  I tried with my digital camera, but I just couldnt do it justice.  I guess i was moving around too much.  One of those bright objects in your pic is Saturn i believe and the other is that US Spy Satellite that is due to fall to the earth in late Feb or early march.  I hear the US will attempt to shoot it down with a missle."
162633,Bernie,2008-02-21 03:32:00,3190,Nice shot Dan!. Is that Saturn above it?
162634,RobHall,2008-02-21 03:37:00,261, I believe it is Bernie.
162635,danc,2008-02-21 03:50:00,4677,"Well thanks guys, but it isn't an awesome shot. There are limitations to point and shoot cameras and the moon is one of them. I used a tripod, tried two different cameras, took about 30 shots, tried a bunch of different settings, and this was about the best that I could come up with. Hopefully someone with a DSLR can post a shot and show us the magic that it can do."
162636,ccmtcanada,2008-02-21 03:51:00,7971,Here's a series of shots from a Nikon Coolpix Camera (point and shoot) with 10X optical zoom.  I wish that it didn't have auto focus...oh well.  My daughter took most of the good ones...the only one that turned out for me was the first in this series.  The rest were the result of her playing around with settings.  She did a great job considering the camera!        
162638,ccmtcanada,2008-02-21 03:55:00,7971,"Here's her favourite....she was pretty excited that she had a pic of the ""man in the moon"".  She said he was wearing sunglasses...LOL  "
162639,Grimace,2008-02-21 03:56:00,2020,"Cool.     We got an awesome view of it out in Edmonton,   the sun was just finished going down as it started.   My camera was back at the house of course.    It was my first prairie eclipse.  Cheers"
162642,Joey,2008-02-21 04:01:00,9122,"Thanks Dan, and Cliff.  I still have the shots you took of the last one on our bulletin board at work Dan  Sorry about the ears    But isn't suffering for a good picture what its all about  Joey"
