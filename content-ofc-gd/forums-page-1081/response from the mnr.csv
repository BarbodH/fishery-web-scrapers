At this time, portable ice huts with a base of more than 21.5 square feet with a tent made of cloth or synthetic fabric are required to be registered with the local MNR District.  Registration of an ice hut is free.  The number assigned is valid for all ice huts owned by the angler and is valid anywhere in Ontario and is not restricted to MNR District or Fisheries Management Zone boundaries.  nric web reader - lr ******************************************* Natural Resources Information Centre PO Box 7000 Peterborough, ON K9J 8M5 1-800-667-1940 Fax: 705-755-1677 [emailÂ protected] http://themnrstore.mnr.gov.on.ca""    lovetofish"
162367,wallyboss,2008-02-20 14:12:00,1095,I got the same response last week in an e-mail from MNR.   They should be looking for poachers instead of worrying if my Trap has a reg. number.
162389,Terry,2008-02-20 15:12:00,14456,and where do you put the numbers mine doesn't have a spot for it so I need to sew or tape a plastic sleeve on it and that kills the warranty
162391,Fisherman,2008-02-20 15:18:00,7201,"Do you have a window in the hut with a cover on the inside?  Take a piece of plastic like a document protector, permanent pen and put your # on in 3"" high letters/numbers and place between the plastic window and inside cover."
162395,Terry,2008-02-20 15:27:00,14456,"I keep that window open 90% of the time, but that is where I have be putting it when closed"
162422,trapshooter,2008-02-20 16:58:00,1234, Exactly.  They really missed the mark with this new regulation.  I would hope they change the wording for next year to exclude all portable ice huts.
162423,wallyboss,2008-02-20 16:59:00,1095,My ol;d fish trap Pro had a sleeve to put put the registration number in it.  But I got a new tent for it this year and that sleeve is not there.  I put it in my back window but that window is always closed in mine.
162544,Woodsman,2008-02-20 23:10:00,1286, What makes you think there will be new regs next year?  Rick
162575,trapshooter,2008-02-21 00:45:00,1234," Sorry, I should have said in the next version of the regs."
162584,Terry,2008-02-21 01:13:00,14456,see the problem is it was always in the regs. that all huts in zones that have hut register had to be registered  then new reg. just made an exception for small portables and put it in the distributed regs ....    now my argument is a hut is  made to be set up and left in the same location for long periods of time a portable shelter is something that folds down and packs away and is taken off the ice each day  I have a portable shelter....that's my story and I am sticking to it
