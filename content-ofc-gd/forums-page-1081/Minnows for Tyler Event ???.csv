162399,Beans,2008-02-20 15:42:00,3339,"While phoning around to find a place to pick up some minnows for next Saturday I spoke with a chap by the name of Keith at:  Innisfil Live Bait and Tackle 5460 Yonge Street Gilford, Ontario (corner of Yonge St.(Hwy 11) and Hwy 89 905-778-8669 opens @ 06:00 AM on the weekends  After explaining what the 4th Annual OFC Fishing for Tyler Meet and Greet is all about he offered (unsolicited) to donate to the prize table...  Anybody else know where minnows can be obtained near the park or north of Innisfil Beach Road ???   Accuweather forcast for Innisfil Ontario: Saturday, Feb 23 Times of clouds and sun.

162403,Terry,2008-02-20 16:01:00,14456,"well I guess there is that tackle shop on the 400 north bound, near king city I think there is Simcoe Bait & Tackle in Barrie, I don't know if  Trombly's Tackle Box 595 West Street South, Orillia  would have them"
162421,Beans,2008-02-20 16:57:00,3339,Big Chevy 4x4 (Chuck) mentioned one on Innisfil Beach Road but damned if we could find it last year...Not too familiar with the area...I know where Sobey's are and where the Park is but...
162425,LeXXington,2008-02-20 17:01:00,1928,Hey Bean's  Try here http://www.innisfilscope.com/ROP/large/misc-WinterFest.htm  lower right? maybe there?
162475,Beans,2008-02-20 19:02:00,3339,"Maybe, but I think Innisfil Live Bait and Tackle would be easier if coming up Yonge St. as they are right on Yonge St."
162556,Chuck Best,2008-02-20 23:55:00,308,"Hey Beans......I think it was 1 line north ,on the ice at the 9th that I mentioned...That would have been Paulyanna fish huts,but I'm not sure if he's got any this year....I know he's open,so I'll try to find out...........TC and tight lines....Chuck....."
