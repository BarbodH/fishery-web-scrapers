162219,Fishnwire,2008-02-20 01:55:00,983," When did I ever suggest ""being confrontational"" with the police is wise?  If you bothered to read what I wrote, you'd know I said just the opposite.  I agree it's best to treat all people with respect...cops too, no more and no less then any other person trying to do their job.  My point is that if some law abiding person chooses, for whatever reason, to be rude or disrespectful to a cop, part of that cop's job is to suck it up, be an adult, and take it.  As far as letting the police, or anyone else, overstep their authority and deny someone their rights...if you want to be a scared little punk who falls in line anytime some little fascist tries to push you around, go ahead.  I guess unlike some people, I'm not the kind of guy who just rolls over when someone tries to bully me.  I'm 36 and an electrician.  What does that have to do with anything?"

162226,JohnF,2008-02-20 02:13:00,3494," He lives in Sevierville, just down the road from Pigeon Forge.  JF"
162227,Daplumma,2008-02-20 02:15:00,1961,"You obviousley dont know me at all.Scared little punk and rolling over are not words that people would use to describe me.Your attitude will change one day,when you have a family to watch over."
162236,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-20 02:32:00,957,"John, your friend is okay with me.  May not make his own whiskey, but could come up with some on short notice.  About 5% in that area have CCW  cards on them.  Don't imagine a little hijacking will hurt this thread."
162249,Fishnwire,2008-02-20 03:12:00,983," You are correct in your statement that I don't know you at all.  Nor do you know me, as your incorrect assumption that I don't have a family that I care about proves.  However, if you allow anyone to invade your privacy or violate your rights just because they're wearing a uniform, you are rolling over.  No doubt about it.  That's what rolling over means.  All I'm saying is that citizens don't have to obey the police when they are overstepping their power and authority, which they occasionally do.  Am I wrong?"
162272,douG,2008-02-20 03:56:00,2693,"Nope, you are absolutely right.  I don't like offering my face to make a point tho, but you go ahead.  I like to pick my fights, and that one ain't one of them."
162287,Cookslav,2008-02-20 05:09:00,1457,"If I was that Kid....and my Dad saw that tape, That officer is the LAST thing that I would have been afraid of LOL!!!  My Uncle worked the beat for many years in Toronto before taking a job with Durham regional in homocide...he now teaches forensic investigation at Aylmer passing on his years of experience. He was a true model to the forces, not to mention myself.  He'll be the first to admitt this officer needs to get a mouth filter....but the officer acted well with in his duties The Kid needed to listen tight, and conform.(yup....same as rolling over) Like it or not his rights were not violated, so he needed to ""roll over"". The teen was in conflict with the law, and I hope he got fined.  Had he respectfully walked away the officer could have done him ""A FAVOR"" and let the issue slide all together. Instead The kid got mouthy....I sure wouldn't be doing him any favors either.  Lets face a truth here... Heres the Scenario: I'm hanging out in your driveway practicing my casting with some dummy baits in the way of you pulling your can into the garage, your kids are playing near by on their bikes, and your expecting friends to come by for a visit. You've asked me not to cast there many times... You've spent money on signs asking me not to cast there... The police have been called many times to ask Anglers to move along...  Now the officers arrive and angrily ask me to leave(cause their sick of seeing me there again and again) And I turn to the officer and say ""Dude....I didn't know, whats your problem?"" (with the no Casting signs glaring in the sunlight behind me) So the officers get ticked off and yell at me about respect for a bit, and tell me to hand over the rod. But I refuse to hand over my baits and rod, while keeping up my beligerent attitude..... Do you reeeeely think I wouldn't be getting peppersprayed, or taken down? Would I not have deserved it? Hell ya I deserve it! I should be seasoned like steak...pepperd, Tenderized and grilled hot And I'd expect it.  You wouldn't provoke a bull would you? You mess with the bull you get the....  C'mon ""THIS PARTICULAR"" officer had a case of verbal diariah, but the kid had a Sh$tty attidue as well... I think they both got what they deserved.  Synopsis, The kid got a bit of a life lesson (allthough I think supporting him will make him even more beligerant) and the officer learned he needs to keep the potty talk proffessional   Amen to that. Generalizing the boys in blue is not cool in my books. Some say respect should be earned... Thats a cop out.(no punn intended) I don't know half the people on this board so by rights they have not ""earned"" my respect...yet I still give it right? I go by the motto of ""burned"" respect. Ya'll get it, but if you burn it...its gone"
162190,Fishnwire,2008-02-20 00:34:00,983," I wasn't talking about plain view.  Obviously if you have a handgun and bag of weed on the seat next to you, you're screwed.  But if the cop wants to get in the vehicle and route around under the seats, open the glovebox or trunk, or have you empty your pockets, what I said earlier is entirely true, and you know it...despite how much you hate to admit it.    Don't try to distort the truth so you can continue to subvert the rights of law obeying   citizens who happen to be unaware of them.  Admit it...we don't always have to do what a police officers asks of us, do we?  What you said earlier would make your life a lot easier, but in fact is not true."
162199,tapout,2008-02-20 00:54:00,166," I agree with that comment for sure.  But one also has to realize, I think anyway, that ONE bad cop or bad anyone for that matter can do alot of damage ( physical, mental,  etc ) to a person in a very short time and it CAN, not always, take alot more time to recover from it.   Someone also made a comment that the cop ""hardly used much force on the kid"" or something like that.  From what I understand isn't ANY unwanted physical contact considered assault?  Why isn't it so when an officer does it?  In the case of this kid, the kid made no indication of being aggressive NOR threatening.  The way he was holding that board sure didn't look like it was going to be used as a ""deadly weapon"".   And also someone asked if there are any videos out there of GOOD cops.  Well this one came to mind.  I've seen it before and just searched and found it.  Talk about patience, professionalism and a class act.  Loved the way he dealt with the guy.  "
162211,Daplumma,2008-02-20 01:28:00,1961,"Bonghitts,I can tell you that being confrontational with the police is not a good plan.The prisons are full of jailhouse lawyers.For the most part cops are just doing what they have to do to get thru the day.They put their life on the line for people who they dont even know.They have to make decisions that may kill them or other innocent people on very short notice.Its very easy to be a Monday morning quarterback and hindsite is 20/20.I have never been mistreated by the cops in any way shape or form.I pretty much follow T-guys procedure when I get pulled over.As people get older and wiser their perspective changes.I wonder what your age is and what you do for a living now.I also wonder if your perspective will change in 20 years.BTW,love the handle! Joe"
162044,Guest lundboy,2008-02-19 19:10:00,0," I agree with you.  I know a guy on the Toronto force (not real well) but we chat occasionally, and he mentions a lot of the stuff that goes on.  But in this day and age of instant stardom, this means everyone has to be more conciensious of what they are doing publically, unless they want to become a ""star"" overnight.  I hate to say it but some police (not neccessarily in Canada), make up their own laws, bylaws, and then try to enforce them.  Some of these cops are rogue, some are directed to act like this.  Recently officers of the NYPD were instructed to be ""meaner & more agressive"" and they would be rewarded by getting more overtime pay!  NY Post: http://www.nypost.com/seven/08132007/news/...arry_celona.htm  Unfortunately it is getting to the point where cities are trying to ban video cameras and such which make people even more suspicious of the activities of the ""authorities"", and then they see stuff like what this ""officer"" is doing.  Police are certainly between a rock and a hard place."
162047,fishing n autograph,2008-02-19 19:15:00,2540,wow....OT for getting mean....  I have to beg and plead to get OT. There have been nights where i work 3 extra hours to finish paperwork and i didn't get OT because it wasn't approved
162049,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-19 19:18:00,957,If I'm ever stopped by a law officer it's likely to take place while I'm driving.  If at night I'll turn on all inside lights.  When he or she arrives at my van. my license and other ID will be on the dash.  Both of my hands will be on the top of the steering wheel.  There will be no illegal items in the vehicle or in my system.  I'll address the officer properly and offer to do as they say.  I'll do everything possible to help prevent them from making a mistake that could be costly to me.
162052,big guy,2008-02-19 19:22:00,414,"What a complete clown. Yes most cops are very courteous, but that's the problem with this video. This portrays a person who is anything BUT a policeman, it portrays a wannabe, a glorified meter-maid.  He's just mad because he's wearing shorts and something resembling a car. Personally, police should wear a ""uniform"" not something that looks like they're going to a bar-b-que. Get some pants and a hat on."
162053,Guest lundboy,2008-02-19 19:22:00,0," And you feel OK about having to do this?  Sounds like you are like the rest of us, intimidated and in fear.  I guess it comes down to what have you got to fear?  At least that is what would be said if such actions came into question.  It's tough to judge how one should act during the situation.  I would feel no matter what I did would appear to be suspicious activity in this day and age."
162056,fishing n autograph,2008-02-19 19:24:00,2540," I would too...dude lives in Tennessee...good 'ol boys!  in all honesty, the ""intimidation"" is internal....it's funny. When I'm at work and i go up and talk to someone to be friendly when i'm on foot...going into a mall or tim hortons and everyone shakes like a leaf. Just because a copper is talking to you doesn't mean you're in trouble."
162061,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-19 19:30:00,957,"Hey boys, I'd do it in all states and in all provinces, not because of fear, but out of respect for the other guy trying to do his job.  It's an effort on my part to stay safe and make it safer for officers of the law to perform their duties.  No chip on my shoulder."
161944,JohnF,2008-02-19 14:57:00,3494," Both, but I gotta admit it does my heart good to see the mouthy little punk get knocked down a rung or two. There are too many kids and even adults with that kind of crappy attitude towards authority these days. What really worries me is that a lot of younger people don't even recognize it as crappy attitude. Imagine how smoothly our world's gonna run in thirty or so years with surly little pukes like that in charge. Should add a really interesting flavour to negotiations and statesmanship.  The problem with that whole scenario, if in fact it wasn't faked, is that the kid's Mom probably will defend the little darling's right to disrespect authority, encouraging his crappy attitude. And on it goes......  Having seen a few real life instances like that I can't say I blame the cop for going over the top. There were times when I was coaching hockey & ball that I felt exactly the same, and I like kids. The worst behaviour problem I ever had was a 13 year old boy who was convinced he was on his way to the NHL. When I finally turfed him off my team for insolence & troublemaking his Dad's response was to punch me - or at least try to.  The cop, or bylaw officer, whatever, is just another kind of problem child. They work under pretty crummy conditions in a lot of cities. There are too many bleeding hearts and over-indulgent parents with misplaced priorities turning the kids they influence (they would say protect) into that little punk on the video. Unfortunately it is what it is and the people who choose to work in law enforcement need to control their responses to everyday occurences like dealing with a surly kid.  I deliberately answered this before reading other responses. Now I'll read on.  BTW. I don't hate kids at all, and I don't even hate kids with spirit. They're the ones who'll take over this world. I hate the people who spoil the kids' potential. It's a very fine line to walk between freedom to grow & indulgence.  JF"
