161588,SlowPoke,2008-02-18 14:36:00,2984,"London Fishing Show and Mini-Swill Saturday February 23 **Noon-1PM** Flying J Travel Plaza - Highbury Ave. South of the 401  I was going to hook up with a few members before the show and thought this might be a good meeting place. The ""J"" serves breakfast all day, regular menu, salad buffet and a daily buffet. You'll have to wait for the fishing show to get cotton candy for the kids.  For those who haven't been, it's nice show. Lots of tackle shops and boat dealers and some lodges. I don't recall seeing any big Manufacturer displays or seminars. There are no bank machines inside but that might give you an excuse to go across the parking lot to the casino.  Lots of free parking Adults - $10.00 Seniors - $8.00 Kids - $3.00  -Brian  London Boat, Cottage and Fishing Show  Directions: Flying J to Western Fairgrounds"
