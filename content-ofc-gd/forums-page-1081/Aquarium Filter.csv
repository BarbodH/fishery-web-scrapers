If it has been in a tank that was infested with brush algae, or beard algae (red algae), you run the risk of infecting your tank.  It's almost impossible to get rid of once you get it.  Even bleach, and letting the parts dry out for a while does not get rid of the spores.  A new one is not that expensive."
