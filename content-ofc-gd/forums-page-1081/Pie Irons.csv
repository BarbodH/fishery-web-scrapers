161543,fishinggeek,2008-02-18 11:02:00,325,I'm thinking about buying a pie iron.  Anyone use them?  Any big difference between aluminum or cast iron?  What about the shape?
161545,lew,2008-02-18 11:18:00,12767,"Absolutely love pie irons & have been using them up at the trailer for many many years.  Nothing better than a group of friends all sitting around a bonfire late at night and toasting up a bunch of sandwiches. Sorta like a fondue party without the fondue.  You can use darned near anything in your fridge to make them and the more imagination you have, the better the sandwich will be.  Mine are the square, double wide, cast iron ones.  Just be sure to spray some Pam to the inside of each iron to prevent the bread from sticking and your good to go."
161552,HTHM,2008-02-18 12:25:00,4082,I'm with Lew on this. Just make sure you get the cast iron ones. They perform the best!
161557,motv8tr,2008-02-18 12:47:00,2587,"mmmmm...spaghetti sandwiches...haven't had one in years....stick with cast iron, it's the best and will last you forever...  Maureen"

161579,Fisherman,2008-02-18 13:45:00,7201,good one!
161592,crappieperchhunter,2008-02-18 14:42:00,2582,My brother has the cast iron hot dog ones. Never leaves on a fishing/camping trip without them. Something about just throwing stuff in the fire to cook really seems to tickle people's fancy.  The first time he got them out for me to try. I thought this is a lotta messin around just for a couple of hotdogs. And really if you sit down and think about it....it is. But DON'T forget them at home because it's fun.
161601,Pigeontroller,2008-02-18 15:08:00,2793,"I've always been fond of the ""Pizza Pie-Iron""  Cast Iron is best. Outdoors Oriented in St. Catharines carries Rome brand cast Iron Pie-Irons."
161627,mistyriver1,2008-02-18 17:14:00,600,"Yep, we use em when camping all the time.  As Lew says spray them with Pam before use.  We make pizza pockets, apple pies, breakfast sandwiches, grilled cheese....."

161937,fishinggeek,2008-02-19 14:43:00,325,"Thanks for the info!  BPS has the Rome ones on their website, so I'll see if the Toronto store has them on sale.  I checked out the sites for LeBaron and MEC and neither had them."
161970,LeXXington,2008-02-19 15:55:00,1928,Hummm looks like I might pick one up for the kiddies
161985,Cookslav,2008-02-19 16:26:00,1457,"mmmm....yup  I have enjoyed them at the trailer as well...apple pie, cherry pie. But Ham and swiss, or left over breakfast bacon and cheddar with a few jalepenos for me is the favorite !!!"
