161613,Crazyhook,2008-02-18 15:43:00,1154,Sad to say once again people have run after the pool is over. We only had 5 people pay up so far.  If you have forgot about it plase PM me and I will let you know where to send the 25 bucks next season we will be collecting before hand...
161694,cthewrld,2008-02-18 22:07:00,99,No surprise.  I almost got executed for suggesting that people join a free Fantasy Fishing Pool.  Who could ever imagine that people on a fishing site would be interested in fantasy fishing!  Better luck next year.

162285,Crazyhook,2008-02-20 05:06:00,1154,Amen Roy...  thought guys here would like to play ( and pay)...  did not even name it OFC this year...
