162001,young_one,2008-02-19 17:27:00,620,Which insurance company do you use? My family's insurance contract expired this year. Planning to shop around and see if I can get a cheaper quota.  I believe its probably cheaper when I combine all the home insurances together. Home insurance + 2 cars + boat
162098,walleyejigger,2008-02-19 20:41:00,876,"i find insurance is one of those things where u have to do the work and call around, no one company is perfect for everyone, i did the whole ""re-shop"" last year and came out with a new company for myself  TD Meloche Monnex were my best rates and significant savings from my previous company  good luck"
162149,Tarzan's Jane,2008-02-19 22:53:00,1183,"Stay away from Great West Life...they had a deal for me because I had the three magic things to insure....car, life and home.  Well the deal for the car was far from a deal....so I did call around and managed to save myself close to $450.00 a year on the car alone. I deal with   AVIVA - Groulx Inc.  for my car only.  Here is their tel number for my area:  (613) 748-1918  toll free (800) 668-0250  Good Luck"
162162,taper,2008-02-19 23:32:00,611,Just remember cheapest may not always be the best. With insurance do some leg work and make sure you go with a company that has a good track record for dealing with claims. When you are all excited over losing a car of having a fire at home the last thing you need is a fight with your insurer. Take it from a guy that previously did insurance repair work their is a difference in how some companies deal with the problems.

They were fantastic and it really couldn't have been any easier.  The rates have been very competitive as well.  I would highly recommend them!"
162384,Landlocked,2008-02-20 14:48:00,171,Find a local broker...they have many options available.
162418,young_one,2008-02-20 16:45:00,620,"Since my old insurance policy will expire soon this week, quickly made a few calls to the big companies. A fellow board member by the name Bassgoon suggested All State, they sound like a big comany, so made the call yesterday. Guess what! 1. The new quota will save me $1200 per year all together. 2. Same insurance policies! 3. They didn't mind one accident I had last year with the boat, (lower unit had to be replaced) 4. I can still shop around for a different boat insruance, the deadline for that is March (its currently in the high $700's) 5. For the sedan, the deductable with previous policy was $3000, now its $500!"
162491,bigbuck,2008-02-20 20:11:00,2449,"You beat me to it, I was going to recommend Allstate, a buddy of mine has been one of their top 5 agents in Canada for the past 5+ years. If you have a clean and I mean clean record (no accidents or tickets), they are tough to beat in most areas."
