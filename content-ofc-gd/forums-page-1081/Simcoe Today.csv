161772,Rustic-Fisher,2008-02-19 00:51:00,826,"Headed out for a few hours today. Parked at BP loaded the sled up and blasted off to BBP to meet some buddies. Got over to them at around Noon and they had a camp already set up and a few fish iced. Decided I would head out into the main basin and fish a shoal 4km away. Set up in 55' and marked only a few so in 20 min I packed up and headed deeper. 110' and start marking steady. Stayed out for 2hrs and hit around 10 lakers and a few whities, on of which was at least 7lbs that came of at the hole oh well next time. Packed up with one whitie and 2 BBQ sized lakers (2-3 lbers  which are every where in that depth it seems this year). Traveling was not to bad but there were some deep pockets of slush around BP that could be an issue for ATVS.  Tight lines, Rustic  Pics include some buddies fish.   "

161899,Roy,2008-02-19 11:51:00,13728,"That's one heck of a nice outing. Thanks for sharing. In that third pic, are you dragging anything under your sled?  Great eating size to those lakers, WTG."
161902,ccmtcanada,2008-02-19 12:23:00,7971,Great report!  Some great eaters there for sure.  Hopefully the ice firms up nicely for this weekend....probably my only ice fishing outing of the year!
161911,Rustic-Fisher,2008-02-19 12:51:00,826,"Hey, Last second idea to head out, I;ll call ya next time steve, I was out about 4 miles off BBP. The slush was a little trickey in some spots but the long track sled did fine. As far as draging something under the sled, it was just a bungee cord I kicked out of the way for the pic. Thanks though.  R"
