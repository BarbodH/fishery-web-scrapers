I'm bringing some rods down to make some casts from shore.  Anyone been there before or have any suggestions for baits etc."

161528,sturgman,2008-02-18 05:09:00,249,Good on you for lending a hand...
161531,scuro,2008-02-18 06:21:00,386,1/4 ounce 1/2 ounce jigheads with deer hair. Colours white yellow bright pink or chartrusse. Get some swedish pimples in straight silver. Get nothing with a with a hook that you can't replace or that is a solid hook. On the ocean look for channels where water has to pass through. Draining water creates a fair bit of current...any sort of current no matter what the time of day. Burn those lures by current and you should catch fish. Cudas...Get some poppers for slack water areas. You will also need leaders...for toothy critters. Actually bring all your crap stuff. Many locals like to fish and have little.
161636,steverowbotham,2008-02-18 18:12:00,1800," With the equipment I need to bring down, I have very little space for tackle, so I can only bring a small selection... i have a few rapala jerkbaits, some topwaters, and pink tubes (shrimp?)  I hope to tie into a few fish at least"
161659,JerseyDog,2008-02-18 19:39:00,190,I caught a Columbian Shark Catfish with frozen shrimp fishing in the surf near Jaco.
161675,Crazyhook,2008-02-18 20:26:00,1154,Chug bugs! white buckstails and black and silver Xraps!
161816,scuro,2008-02-19 02:31:00,386," First time down I would focus on the easiest fish to catch which will be Cuda. Bucktails with a good hook!! White or silver with party colours mixed in. Silver works great. If it is not a good solid hook on the bucktail forget it, even small fish will bend out your hooks. Chug bugs ehhh...gotta try it. Poppers worked for me and a Zara spook! Don't forget leaders...down south is a place where you want floro or good titanium because the fish will kink cheaper leaders to crap in short order."
161846,huey graphite,2008-02-19 02:53:00,362,   Has someone had a drink or two?
161917,Rustic-Fisher,2008-02-19 13:01:00,826,"BPS pack rod, tons of soft  jerk baits. Lews minnow baits (they already come with salt water hooks, and there cheap)  These did the trick in Jamaica.  R"
162116,mepps,2008-02-19 21:26:00,1301,Have a great time!  You cant go wrong with Xraps or silver spoons.  Check local shops for sabiki rigs to catch your own bait and you'll do great.
162171,GbayGiant,2008-02-19 23:59:00,1780,"Good luck, have fun. I've seen a lot of guys using the saltwater gulp on the WFN latley having lot's of success for a lot of species or live bait is never a bad idea."
