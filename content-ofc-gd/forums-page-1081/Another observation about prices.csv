161948,irishfield,2008-02-19 15:08:00,26272,"Prices are cheaper state side so they can pool their left over funds for medical issues.    Sure wouldn't want to be handed the bill for tomorrows episode with my daughter. Remember...someone pays for our free medicare here in Canada... and it ain't the government !!  Companies in the US don't have to raise prices on everything to cover the 2.95% OHIP charged on gross Payroll. Don't suspect they match the CPP or 1.4x UI payments made by employees either. Not sure what the US pays for workers comp... we get nailed for anything from 2% to 30% depending on the industry here in Canada. Property taxes are no where near as high in general in the US (hell parts of Texas, and some other states, will give you free facilites..and I'm talking anywhere from 10,000 square feet to 1/2 a millon square feet... and wave all taxes for 5 years just to go there), although electricity (at least used to be) is more expensive. Thanks to all this, and other issues, even with the dollar par for par and a supplier next door to both a US store and a Canadian store selling at the same wholesale price... the Canadian store has to have a higher sale price to make the same profit."
161994,kickingfrog,2008-02-19 16:35:00,8333,"I don't doubt that many places are trying to increase their margins with the increase value of the Canadian dollar vs the Yankee buck, and it burns me too. That said, the US minimum wage is $5.85 (American $) and the Canadian minimum wage is $8.85 (Canadian $). With with the bottom of the wage scale set lower most other wages are scaled lower as well. Start multiplying that by the number of employees and the other associated employ cost that have been mentioned above and a difference in prices to be expected. Whether that difference should be as high as they are is debatable.  Canada has about a tenth of the population of the US that has a huge impact on buying power as well."
162005,Photoz,2008-02-19 17:31:00,792,"This is SO O O  O   O simple, I'm astounded no one else has mentioned it . . . .    if you're going shopping for a book, calendar fishing line or something else that has one price for American $ and another for Canadian $, what would be wrong with stopping at the bank and picking up $50.00 U. S. When you take your item ($10.00 U. S., or $16.00 Cdn.) to the cash register, GIVE 'EM their $10.00 U. S., in U. S. dollars . . . . .    why wouldn't this work?"
162009,ccmtcanada,2008-02-19 17:40:00,7971,"When it comes right down to it, companies get away with these higher prices because people continue to buy them at those prices.   Sure, some people are making conscious decisions to buy from the US to get the price break, but the majority of people do not do this.  Unless the price difference is causing a significant impact to sales, then prices will remain higher...depsite the high Canadian dollar."
162010,kickingfrog,2008-02-19 17:45:00,8333, Most books and magazines now only list the Canadian price. Many people did try to pay for items that had both a Canadian dollar price and a US price. This practice was met with varying degrees of success. A store does not have to sell you and item (bad PR and business practices aside) if it choses not to.
162046,irishfield,2008-02-19 19:14:00,26272, It won't work because a store is only obliged to take Canadian funds at Canadian prices. If it was that easy Steve I'd be putting to use my US cash PDQ!
162103,Headhunter,2008-02-19 20:54:00,5703,"I believe I heard somewhere that Canadian pricing is higher the the States, simply because Canadians are willing to pay more! If this is correct, then nothing will change until our collective attitudes change... and good luck with that! HH"
162136,Ancient Mariner,2008-02-19 22:21:00,1,"Just to keep beating this horse;  I am a retailer and feel that Irishfield is right on about higher Canadian wages and Social Benefits / Health Care taxes. Would everyone who is willing to take a 35% wage cut & give up their Health Care & Social Benefits please form a line facing east on ther Peace Bridge.  Depsite ""Free Trade"", it seems that we do get hit with higher import duties on a lot of goods that come in from the rest of the world.  Also, everything that we bring in from the USA still requires some fairly hefty brokerage fees, which we have to pass on.  Oh, by the way, go buy some US $$. The average person will pay a 2-2.5% exchange fee. If you have the right connections you may get it for less, but a lot of businesses have to pay it, so they have to pass it on.  Uncle Buck also makes a good point.  Question; Where are all the decent paying Manufacturing Jobs going??  Answer; Out the front door of WM, BPS, LB or wherever with ""Made in (insert third world country here)"" !!  Seems too many of us have the ""you should - they should syndrome"". Everyone else should buy North American, but I want the lowest price.  At least we have the money for computers and other essentials to go with the time and freedom to sit at them and say whatever we want!!"
162210,Loonietoon,2008-02-20 01:26:00,1450,"Hey Pikehunter, I can get it for 14.99 was on this weekend at the Boat & Fishing Show and I also have an in with the Owner of Redwing Tackle so you might want to let me know and with the Sportsman Show coming up and I will be there just might get my hands on some"
162371,pikehunter,2008-02-20 14:19:00,1659," I hear what you're saying Rob. Just that roughly 50% difference was a little much to understand at the time. A 5 to 15% difference in price is a less of a shock and is probably more in line with newer shipments on the shelf.  I don't make it a regular habit to go cross border shopping, sometimes a change of pace though is nice and as you are aware there are many products not available in Canada so just going over to gaze in wild wonderment can be intoxicating!  But then the cross border shopping problem doesn't end at Walmart or the outlet Mall. How many Canadians hop across the bridge and grab a cheap flight out of Buffalo? So many taxes and airport fees are less or non-existent  in the States and that saves some a lot of money just in itself."
162385,Canuck2fan,2008-02-20 15:00:00,1444," I would agree with some of what you say but blaming the difference in prices on our health care system is a non starter to me. Our UNIVERSAL health care system is cheaper than the American system (which is not universal btw) as a percentage of GDP so that ain't the problem. Whether it is paid for by taxes or individuals it COSTS more per capita in the U.S. for health than it does here, and that has to be figured into what products cost in both countries. So it can't be the reason things cost more here if anything that should make them cost less here. Or if you are right and it does then no economic theory I have ever heard of works....  Also, the only reason we had ANY CAR plants left here is because of the competitive advantage our public health system gave the big three over having to pay the astronomical private insurance rates in the U.S. Without that our plants would have been closed in the 70's.... Now that the U.S. unions have taken over the cost of health care you will continue to see plants here close and be moved back to the States. The strong dollar hurts too.  As for where and why the manufacturing jobs are going overseas.  Ask the INVESTORS/OWNERS who buy stock in the companies that are moving those jobs off shore.... The sick thing is most of those investors are the pension plans of the workers who are selling off their OWN JOB by allowing the pension plan to fund this kind of globalization.... I wonder if we will wake in North America before it is too late?"
162599,fishinggeek,2008-02-21 02:07:00,325,"While it's true the American medicare system is far and away more expensive than our universal system, I think our tax system in general and relatively higher operating costs are to blame for our higher prices.  Everyone, both companies and individuals, face way higher taxes in Canada than our southern neighbour.  And at least in theory, any tax (whether levied to business or consumers) will almost always lead to higher prices.  With respect to operating cost, we are not nearly as polarized in income as the USA.  We generally have higher proportions of educated and skilled workers, so our wages are higher.  And our income attributable to capital is extremely low when compared to the states, which means our equipment is much less efficient.  Heavy taxes and inefficient, costly operations are the main culprits to the price differentials, in my opinion.  I always look at prices and I buy whatever is cheaper, whether local or an import.  Though local retailers may suffer somewhat, the consumer is actually gaining quite a bit in terms of discretionary income and welfare.  If I pay lower prices, that means I can buy more lures, retire earlier, or send my kids to a European university, so I am better off.  By me paying higher prices to local retailers, I feel I am subsidizing companies that cannot compete with foreign competitors, and I don't feel that providing subsidies to businesses is my job.  And in the end, I think it's healthy to trade between countries.  If the USA is better at the retail trade, let me buy their retail products.  Similarly, they can import our Canadian things like oil, forestry inputs, and even coming up here to our great fishing resorts!"
161318,Casey123,2008-02-17 17:41:00,461,"My wife and I refuse tobuy anything made in China, Christmas shopping for our family took 3 times as long but there was a certain sense of satisfaction. That being said we are in the market for a new Truck and Boat this year.   Why are the MSRP for vehicles 20% + less in the USA, if you don't believe me look at the following:  An Audi Q7 US vs. CND A Volvo XC90 US vs CDN A GMC Yukon US vs CDN  Then you need to look at the boats, North American Made products, Tracker and Lund both have beautiful boats, only problem is the price spread.  I understand that it costs more to do business in Canada and that the dealers do not push through the same volume as US Dealers, but what about the savings, health care premiums, US is much higher as they have no gov health care, also litigation, this cost is built into every US price because in general terms the US is a much more litigous society then we are.  If in doubt PM me and I will fill you in on the details as we import equipment from Europe and are in the process of expanding into the USA.  There is no real public outcry, in November when the public turned the heat up, the car dealers started to offer cash rebates, but they never really adjusted their prices on a permaent basis.  Know the heat has died down, those cash rebates only apply if you buy cash.  In the US the price is the price, and they still offer low fiance rates.  I would like to support my local business, we have always made a point of avoiding the big box shops like wall mart, Home Depot and Best Buy, but at what cost am I willing to pay to support our local dealers.  Is a $71 000.00 CDN Volvo that is only Worth $48 000.00 US really worth my loyalty.  Should I pay $23 000.00 more to say I am proud to buy CDN?  You tell me!"
161320,Guest lundboy,2008-02-17 17:43:00,0," Besides, when you reach the Canadian border they will make you turn in your Meat, Dairy and produce.  It's illegal to bring it across the border."
161321,bucktail,2008-02-17 17:44:00,1857,IT's greed and nothing more.
161327,gekhunter,2008-02-17 17:55:00,61," Well said, I have to agree, there are a variety of factors influences the price and for those reasons above we shouldn't expect equal prices even if the dollar is at parity."
161407,pikehunter,2008-02-17 20:48:00,1659,"Not asking for equal pricing, just pricing that is fair, a 5 - 15% difference can be justified.  And yes I agree that some food prices are better in Canada than the States, but then I believe that is only a regional observation because of grocery store competition in Southern Ontario. We have an overabundance of grocery stores as to the population and now Wally is entering into food big time so we should at least be assured that grocery costs may remain reasonable and the price we pay in the Toronto-Hamilton-Niagara area will be dictated by weater and fuel costs."
161447,OhioFisherman,2008-02-17 23:17:00,6623,"As long as I remember the prices in Ontario seemed high, even with the exchange rate. Other than transportation costs and import fees whatever they amounted to over the years I could never understand the reason.  I can only recall buying a couple of fishing lures up there, Heddon Strawberry Vamps, wood ones, because we didn`t see them here and they caught some fish, but like the 1960`s? Bought some line up there too, emergency.  Even cabin rental prices seemed to go up quickly, demand? an increasing population, an increasing cost for water front property?  LOL back in the 60`s a cabin rental was like 60 to 90  dollars a week, like a third to half an average Americans weekly pay, so it didn`t hurt as much."
161665,holdfast,2008-02-18 19:52:00,1813,"I think this is Kind of related.  Market Place just had a show to see if the drop in GST actually made it to the Consumer.  WRONG O.  Prices never lowered, But the drop in GST was absorbed to the seller that profited.  Example they gave was your Movie Theatre ticket.  Your hockey ticket.  How about your car Dealers.  So do you really think that these same companies will loosen THEIR Pockets for us the consumer with the Dollar Exchange.  Slap yourself silly if you think we're not getting Gouged."
