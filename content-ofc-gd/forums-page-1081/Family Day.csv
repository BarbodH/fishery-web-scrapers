We hit the Aviary and took in the sights and sounds of Clifton Hill for a few hours.  Topped it all off with a feed of wings and pizza at a local favorite.  Great day spending time with my family.  Cheers  Craig"

161789,ccmtcanada,2008-02-19 01:41:00,7971,"Woke up and went trib fishing with my wife at first light.  Nothing was going on, so we had a nice breakfast at a local greasy spoon.  Came home around 10:00am and then made some crafts with my 5 year old daughter until lunch.  Here's our handiwork...thank goodness for the internet and ideas...LOL.   After lunch my 5 yr old and I went to a local convenience store to get some things for baking cookies.  We made a few dozen chocolate chip cookies together....I overcooked them, but what do you want...it was the first time I ever made them....and I took instructions from a 5 yr old.....haha.   We also made an impression of her little hand....been meaning to do this for years and today seemed as good a day as any to accomplish this....   We then rented a few movies and ate dinner in front of the TV and let her stay up 1/2 hour later than her usual bedtime....here's a pic of us at the end of her day.....   Now comes the fun part....clean up.....tomorrow I get to go to work so I can relax....phew!!!"
