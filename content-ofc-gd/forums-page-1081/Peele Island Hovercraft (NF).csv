162512,ketchenany,2008-02-20 21:04:00,3229,I'm having a contriversy    with one of our writers (tourism) about a hovercraft to Peele Island. Has anyone seen used it and if so does it have a regular schudule?  Thanks for your help
162523,Chrispy,2008-02-20 22:02:00,168,I heard that they were proposing a hovercraft.....but whether they got one is another story....here is a link to the Pelee Island Ferry.....they have a 1-800 number to call so you can get more info.....   http://www.pelee.com/transportation_island.asp    Chrispy!

I had brother Joonmoon (who is 6'4"") and Pops do some tree huggin' for scale. It was over 18' around and close to 60' tall. I had to walk a long way down the road to get the last pic.    "

162750,Bob Devine,2008-02-21 16:41:00,251,The Flyer was fast and would ride above the waves but on BIG Erie wave days it had to be slowed downed and could not ride on the Hydrofoils. It would take abut 25 minutes to get to the Island at crusing speeds versus the almost 3 hrs on the Jiiman Ferry. I was on the Flyer once for a memorial to the Island for a friend who passed away on the tragic flight 126 from Pelee Island.
