401766,jimmer,2009-11-12 21:26:00,2730,"That's cool.  I was just talking with a buddy the other day about going out into the Pigeon Lake catails and fishing down through them for monster bass (as a lark of course), now.....Hmmmm."
401787,mbac31,2009-11-12 23:14:00,904,This also happens here in Canada. Labrador and Newfoundland in the thick Guweity and Floating bogs we would as kids cut holes in the floating stuff to gain access to large Brook Trout (Mud Trout) but landlocked ones  down there. Basically the same. Eskimos do this for Char in the bogs as well.  They also do this in the thick stuff in the everglades in Southern US for Catfish etc.
