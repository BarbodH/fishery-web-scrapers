401439,mistaredone,2009-11-11 21:36:00,913,I got a quote from a marina for a low hrs 90hp 2 stroke 2000 Yamaha with controls installed for $5000 plus tax.  Seem fair or should I keep looking?  Also should I look at a four stroke?  Does price jump alot going from 2-4 stroke?  Is it worth the extra cost?  Thanks  Steve
401453,T Fisher,2009-11-11 22:05:00,139,"Wait a month and by a new one, but buy a NEW 2009 Merc at not much more $7000.  A  2000 90 hp yammy is 10 years old. It's done or close to it."
401459,Jer,2009-11-11 22:45:00,1426,"   ...done?  I would certainly hope not! My 2000 Johnson runs as good as new, I hope to get alot more trouble free years on my motor.  I agree that $5000 may be a bit steep, but I don't know where you would find any NEW 90hp motor of any brand for only $7000."
401631,corvette1,2009-11-12 12:46:00,1765,in the usa a merc 115 four stroke runs about 9900 and a opti 9200 as of monday
401646,Tom McCutcheon,2009-11-12 13:55:00,627,"  Is that installed?  With the dollar the way it is, if installed that is a great price."
401675,corvette1,2009-11-12 16:01:00,1765,i did not ask but the dollar is at 5 cents exchange
