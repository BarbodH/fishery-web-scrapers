The outboard motors are starting to pile up in my basement so now I'm purging the riff-raff. I have for free, no strings attached a 1968 Mercury 6 hp. The motor was taken apart for cleaning and repainting when I got it. I never got around to it in the two years I've owned it since I have several other motors that are higher on my list of priorities. The motor has great compression and was supposedly running before the tear down. The lower unit needs to be rebuilt (new bearings not gears). I believe everything is included in the box, but I make no promises.  If anyone is interested in repairing an old outboard for fun or learning this is a good one. All you have to do is come pick it up in Ancaster (Hamilton). I'll be away hunting all next week so the sooner you get it the better. Drop me a PM. "
