401501,BUSTER,2009-11-11 23:56:00,1336,"Iam going to bass pro friday , i guess ill add those to my list."
401510,Leecher,2009-11-12 00:34:00,7832,Showoff    ya just had to get your feet in the footage eh?     J/K COOL TJ    U the man!!!  Now I just have to go get some Leechman
401511,Skud,2009-11-12 00:35:00,739,I bought a pair of those last winter due to a friends recommendation. They are warmer then other socks I have that I paid $20 for.  I wouldn't walk 4km without boots for a free pair though. You're nuts TJ.
401513,Fisherman,2009-11-12 00:37:00,7201,"First I couldn't figure out what the heck all the guffaw was about, 'puter at work doesn't indicate or show the video, now that I've seen it, I think you should become the torture tester for any product..."
401516,FSNmachine,2009-11-12 00:43:00,22,Thats crazy. As far as the socks I have a couple pairs that I have had for a few years already. I use them for ice fishing and wearing in my boots. No cold feet and they are very comfortable for a day on your feet on the ice.
401518,boatman,2009-11-12 00:49:00,350,I know a few guys that work in remote Northern Ontario (fly-in stuff away from any communities) that swear by those socks. I have yet to try them even though they say I'll never go back to regular socks.
401585,douG,2009-11-12 03:24:00,2693,"No issue with the common sense filter, I see.  That was nutso, walking a few miles in only socks.  We are all very proud."
401633,TJQ,2009-11-12 12:52:00,7806,"Thanks everyone!!  It was fun to do!!!  Im definalty gonna pick up a few pairs.. the bottoms are thick, they would even make good slippers!!"
401635,azebra,2009-11-12 13:10:00,168,"I have a pair of those socks and the blue ones(extreme cold) awesome! great cushion great warmth, i went on a hunting trip this past weekend, i wore a silk liner sock under them to wick away more moisture. my feet were warm and pretty darn dry after walking and also sitting still in a tree stand for 4 hours one cold cold morning. A++ SOCKS GET EM, your feel will thank you, i even wear em fishing in my waders. but unlike T.J.Q I wouldn't ware them AS Waders lol"
401311,TJQ,2009-11-11 14:14:00,7806,"A couple of weeks ago, I was approached by BPS to see if I could help promote thier line of hunting socks.  They are a supporter of the site, always helping out with gift cards and stuff for our contests, auctions and tourneys, so I said, sure!  I told them to send me a pair and I would field test them.  Here it is...  this was done on Monday...    Im gunna get a few more pair, they are fantastic."
401314,Roy,2009-11-11 14:29:00,13728,They DO look like good socks but you are one sick dude!  What was Monique wearing for the trek?
401316,TJQ,2009-11-11 14:30:00,7806,Avery was with me.. driving the bike out and shaking his head the whole way......
401319,Roy,2009-11-11 14:33:00,13728,hahahahaha  shoulda had a camera on him too!
401320,limeyangler,2009-11-11 14:35:00,5204,"Excellent video TJ!  Love the bit when you approach the 2nd creek and say ""This is gonna suck""....LOL....YA THINK!  you deserve a medal or an extended stay in a mental health clinic...or both...lol.  My wife actually picked out 2 pairs of those for me when we visited BPS in Vaughan in October. Its been a bit warm for me to wear them yet, but i tried them on and they feel comfy and toasty....dont think i'll be double socking this winter....and with a lifetime gaurantee for $12.99 cant go wrong really.  Just a thought....what would you have done if you thought the socks sucked! That would have been a good video too...dont think you would have got many more gift cards though for ththe competitions....lol.  Have you moderater guys ever thought of having a 'Product Review' section on the site...would that be workable? I definitely would be up for writting  up reviews for the gear i use...both pros and cons.  Anyhoo......thanks for the video...great job!  Cheers  Simon"
401327,Terry,2009-11-11 15:17:00,14456,they look like great socks           who's going to tell him they are meant to be worn inside boots
401330,Fish Farmer,2009-11-11 15:21:00,2234,"Man you must have tuff feet, just watching you walk made my feet sore. You got me sold TJ on getting a pair. I just had an insane thought. Spiel mite be looking for a custom rod tester Great video TJ thanks for sharing."
401364,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-11 17:29:00,10439,"T.J. there is a real possibility that you may be a few fries short of a happy meal!!!  On another note, when I'm in Ontario visiting my folks at Christmas I'll have to pick up a couple of pairs."
401369,wuchikubo,2009-11-11 17:32:00,1114,"  Uh oh, someone forgot to tell him there are hunting boots out there, I guess that will be the next up for field testing. (Not sure what TJ will put them through.)  All said and done, TJ has got me sold on the socks too."
401389,snoil,2009-11-11 18:53:00,139,The Forrest Gump of OFC!!
401392,irishfield,2009-11-11 19:02:00,26272,Socks?? I'm just damn amazed you can walk 4 km in one day !  You're one screwed up dude Quesnel...
401397,John,2009-11-11 19:17:00,2956,"Socks look great.......but I must say dude, the feet are damn ugly!"
401398,ketchenany,2009-11-11 19:22:00,3229,[ You're one screwed up dude Quesnel...   Even worse if the Tutu came into play!  First we put on our socks and the we put on our boots and THEN we walk
401404,irishfield,2009-11-11 19:36:00,26272,"Leah was down and needed a laugh.... and she thanks you for that Boss.. BUT she also adds..  ""For God's sake... please.. please.. don't ask him to field test their hunting briefs""  "
401406,Roy,2009-11-11 19:52:00,13728, He will as soon as BPS  comes out with a ladies version in camo.
401409,Terry,2009-11-11 19:59:00,14456,of course you are too late for that statement   from their fall collection..really   
401410,irishfield,2009-11-11 20:12:00,26272,Well get Monique to test drive it.... or then again that would probably be TJ's job...
401441,misfish,2009-11-11 21:43:00,29133,"You are quacked,or maybe you need a quack.LOL  I own a pr of them.I guess if your walking in them thier warm,but if your sitting for hours,they aint.  Love the vid though,and your country there.  Invy is setting in now."
401442,ehg,2009-11-11 21:44:00,2666,"That is a great video  Bought a pair after some advertisement here a month ago, they are the warmest most comfy socks ever. The lifetime warranty almost doesn't matter."
401462,alphaalpha,2009-11-11 22:54:00,475,"lol, quite the test.  nicely done!"
401475,Roy,2009-11-11 23:11:00,13728,I'll be getting a few pairs for sure.
401480,misfish,2009-11-11 23:20:00,29133, I look forward to your report Roy. I know you can do a 5 km trek.
401482,irishfield,2009-11-11 23:21:00,26272, I didn't realize he was talking about the socks Brian..
