401265,Jonny,2009-11-11 06:08:00,1380," I'm not sure how you evaluate that, but I have used both and the red dot will work in almost total darkness - you could use it by the light of a flashlight if it weren't HIGHLY illegal!  If we did night-time coon hunting in Ontario, nothing would be better than a red dot."
401267,Sinker,2009-11-11 06:40:00,8692," I dunno, I had a red dot, and once it starts getting dark, all you can see is that red dot........nothing else. I had mine on a slug gun, and a BLR. I missed a couple chances at deer because I couldn't find them.......all I could see was that friggen red light!!!  I'd take a scope over the red dot anyday.  S."
401331,Jonny,2009-11-11 15:24:00,1380," My Bushnell red dot has eleven brightness settings on a rotary dial. I can dial it from too bright for a sunny day to barely visible in near darkness. Red is probably also the colour chosen for a red dot sight because exposure to the colour red does not affect human ability to see in low light.  Add to that the fact that with the red dot (and 0 magnification) you shoot with both eyes open, and the view you have is almost as good as with nothing in front of your eyes at all, just this red dot 'magically' hanging there and pointing wherever you want it to.  People can (and do!) have their preferences, but for low light conditions and close-in (i.e. up to 100 yds or so where magnification isn't needed) you simply can't beat a red-dot-type sight."
401437,misfish,2009-11-11 21:33:00,29133,  Paul
401455,wuchikubo,2009-11-11 22:09:00,1114," Okay, I need you to elaborate on your opinion. Why do you believe it's the best?"
401476,misfish,2009-11-11 23:13:00,29133," Stan,thier all,well except Cliff    talking jibberish.Thats drunk,n newfienezz.  Make the drive bud.Talk to the guys that know. They carry everything,except the middleton."
401655,Jonny,2009-11-12 14:43:00,1380,Here's a good article on red dot (reflex) sights...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex_sight
401692,Sinker,2009-11-12 16:58:00,8692,"Have you ever used a good quality, light gathering scope? There is a big difference."
401697,Jonny,2009-11-12 17:38:00,1380," Yes I did, before red dots were common. But IMO no matter how much you tweak a good quality scope it will always be a little less efficient than a red dot in low-light, short to medium range conditions. The combination of an illuminated aim point and two-eyes-open sighting is just impossible to beat."
399152,ch312,2009-11-04 00:06:00,1590, that is because they are nearly an exact copy of excalibur crossbows and they stole the design rather than paying to make up their own
399157,misfish,2009-11-04 00:11:00,29133,  This is true.
399246,Stern Rules,2009-11-04 05:06:00,342,Thanks. I'll check out the OFAH site.
399250,Big Cliff,2009-11-04 08:09:00,6899," Well, if that is true, why are they faster, have more power, and use a different limb technology? Excalibur tried to sue them for pattent infringement and lost. It may look similar but IMHO it is a better product!"
399252,Carp,2009-11-04 08:42:00,1488," I have 2 Excalibur crossbows. Never had a problem, just a string change you can do yourself. They're 12 and 10 years old respectively and still shooting like day one. About 25 fps. difference between them, but they both have plenty of power to take game within 40 yards. Most of the game I shoot are at 10 yards or less with the furthest being being about 25 yards. Bolts go right through a deer most times."
399587,Dabluz,2009-11-05 04:55:00,701," Are you planning to sell one of your crossbows?  I also plan to take up hunting with a crossbow.  The initial question is just right up my alley.  I can only hunt moose in my area and the bowhunting season is far nicer than the rifle season.  Since we have to be 2 hunters for moose....which is a pain since my buddies no longer go hunting, I will probably go south to go deer hunting.  I'm not a serious hunter, I just like to go hunting and camping alone.  Shooting anything will just be the cherry on the icing.  Is using a scope on a crossbow a good idea?  I would think that a good sight would be just as good and make the crossbow lighter.  I have no idea as to what a good crossbow and accessories will cost."
399597,Big Cliff,2009-11-05 08:08:00,6899,I like a good scope because they help gather light allowing you to get shots that you might not be able to get otherwise. A good package all rigged up will probably run you about $1000.00.
399602,wuchikubo,2009-11-05 09:55:00,1114,"Dabluz brought up a question I had in my mind, why do hunters need more than one crossbow? I'm assuming you only bring one while hunting, wouldn't one be sufficient for all game? Or are there specific actions that separate them like fishing rods?"
399719,Dabluz,2009-11-05 19:25:00,701,1000 dollars....whoa....that's a bundle for me.  I know that I don't need a scope nor the rack to hold extra bolts so I guess I will save a bit right there.  Are the crossbows with cams cheaper?
399794,dave524,2009-11-05 23:04:00,4508,"CAUTION: you really do need the rack/quiver to hold your extra bolts, one with a hood protecting the broadheads or rather protecting you from the razor sharp edges. More than a few hunters have received self inflicted wounds from them accidently."
399903,chilli,2009-11-06 03:19:00,199,No matter what the fps your best advice is to practice with whatever you get as often as possible. My son and I go under a bridge on the railway to simulate being in a tree stand and shooting downward because the downward angle is different. Read your last Ontario out of Doors mag for those details. Practice practice practice.  I have an Excaliber Vortex and I upscaled the scope abit. I use the cocking aid religiously as this ensures a consistant pull everytime. I also protect that scope so it doesn't get a jolt while traveling through the bush.  Ten point is also a crossbow made in Canada according to the merchant in Port Colbourne. It can't be dryfired. To my knowledge neither ten point or excaliber use nocks.  Since I bought my excal I've filled my tags and with the perfect shot. I'd never pull the trigger otherwise.
399911,ch312,2009-11-06 03:37:00,1590,dont skimp out on the quiver as you NEED one. they are $20 so you dont need to worry about that. shooting with pins instead of a scope will save you some money. just search around for a used bow and go from there.
400638,Jonny,2009-11-09 15:16:00,1380,"I've been out deer hunting so I've been away from this topic.  My advice would be twofold:  1) To echo other comments here, I would absolutely NOT do without a quiver. It keeps the bolts handy for a second shot (when mounted on the bow), it's a good storage device for them when not hunting, it keeps the broadheads protected and sharp, and it prevents you cutting yourself on them.  2) Hunting without a red-dot sight certainly can work, but be prepared sooner or later for a legal-light shot that you can't take because you can't see the pins. Get a red-dot."
400737,misfish,2009-11-09 21:27:00,29133," IMO, I would not go with a red dot.I have used one for two years.I now use the trueglo scope.Sited in for 10,20 30 and 40 yards.At very low light(legal still) I can see much better with the new scope even the crosshairs, then I could with the red dot.  Another draw back.You could forget to turn the scope off,then when your up in your tree,theres no red dot.Battery is dead."
400743,wuchikubo,2009-11-09 21:42:00,1114,"Brian, is Trueglo the brand? if not, what is the brand name so I can look it up.  Stan"
400747,Terry,2009-11-09 21:51:00,14456,might be truglo scope
400748,wuchikubo,2009-11-09 21:53:00,1114," Thx Terry, looking at the site now."
400763,Jonny,2009-11-09 22:52:00,1380," Trueglo could very well be an option. I'm not familiar with it. Thing is, it sounds like it's also a low-light alternative to pins, which I would avoid.  You don't have to worry much about batteries in a red dot, Bushnell anyway, which is what I've got. I just came back from a deer hunt where I used a red dot on my Browning BLR .308 too.  I used mine one day, forgot to turn it off overnight and used it the next day. It was on for about 34 hours straight and the dot was still bright.  I tested the battery life once by leaving it on and it went 48 hrs and was still bright. You can tell when the battery power is getting low because the dot will get dimmer; it doesn't suddenly go out.  I replace my battery as a matter of course after every two full days of hunting (I leave it on all the time, morning to night). The 2032 batteries it uses I can buy at Dollarama for $1 for a 3-pak. Six days of hunting costs me $1.  They're only the size of a quarter, so I always keep a couple of spare batteries in my pocket when out in the field."
400771,misfish,2009-11-09 23:28:00,29133," The scope gives a bright and clear sight.  For those that hunt weekends and leave the light on(red dot) it will be out.  Why bother with a battery, when you can get all you need from the Truglo.    Thanks Terry.  Jocko,how many dots do you have in yours? 3?"
400775,Jonny,2009-11-09 23:38:00,1380," You mean this one?  (see attachment)..........  ... looks like the same 2032 battery.   Incorrect. If you turn on the Bushnell red dot on Saturday morning and leave it on, it will still be bright by the time you finish hunting on Sunday. "
400779,misfish,2009-11-09 23:45:00,29133," Wrong scope. http://www.eders.com/products/truglo-4x32-...ings-black.html   I was talking about hunting sat/sun,then returning the weekend after."
400782,Jonny,2009-11-09 23:55:00,1380," It's a Truglo scope. (?)   Well it would serve someone right. Then again we're talking about an easily replaceable battery that costs, what, 40 cents? Somehow I don't see a problem here.  I already said Truglo could be a good option and wasn't trying to ""outsell"" you, just giving detail about what a red dot is really like to use."
400784,Big Cliff,2009-11-10 00:00:00,6899,"I've used red dots in the past and they are very good but when I am hunting in close cover, low light conditions, there is nothing better than a good scope that allows you that extra 15 minutes of shooting time."
400793,PAZE,2009-11-10 00:27:00,132,"OK are you guys all done yet??? LOL   Ten Point bar none the best crossbow you will ever buy, if you can afford it this would be the choice.  Paul"
401256,ch312,2009-11-11 05:08:00,1590,checkout the excalibur lumizone scope...mine should be here before the weekend
398666,wuchikubo,2009-11-02 17:46:00,1114,"With all the hunting pics and posts a couple weeks ago, I finally registered myself for a course.  I finally did the hunter's safety education course yesterday. Since I'm not into rifle the HSE course was the one for me.  Now the question is which crossbow should I consider? As one who has never done any hunting and will be learning quite a bit, I was hoping to see if anyone here could pass me some of there experiences with crossbows. I'm not interested in the compound bow as I have one weaker should due to a sports injury in high school.  Looked at a couple of crossbows:  1) Excalibur Phoenix 2) Excalibur Vortex 3) Barnett Quad 400 4) Barnett Predator (a bit pricey though)  Any thoughts would be welcomed.  Stan"
398670,bassjnkie,2009-11-02 17:57:00,1101,"You have some really nice choices . I love Excalibur and have used the Phoenix and Vortex, they are great bows, fast, reliable and really accurate with minimal noise when the trigger is pulled. Maintenance, string change and tuning is very easy since it has no cams, so no need for a bow press. I don't know where your located but Shooter's Choice and Wolf's Den have a great selection.  EDIT: Sorry, I have no experience with the Barnett line."
398672,basketclam,2009-11-02 18:01:00,115,"I agree.  If you stick with an Excalibur bow, it's going to be hard to go wrong.  They are really simple to maintain and operate, are tremendously accurate and are well made.  Because they're a local company, they're easy to get ahold of if you have any issues, and their customer service has been really good to me so far (mind you, the only issue that I've had to deal with them for is a cracked scope cover).  I don't know much about Barnett, so can't help in that regard."
398711,Sinker,2009-11-02 20:08:00,8692,"You really can't go wrong with an excal. They are built to last, accurate, and easy to maintain. Being made in canada is also a bonus!!  S."
398713,misfish,2009-11-02 20:16:00,29133,"See, told ya.  I still like my PSE compound though."
398716,wuchikubo,2009-11-02 20:22:00,1114,"Alright, since I like the fact Excalibur is Canadian and there are so many good comments so far, I have one further question, the difference I see in fps is 25 more the Vortex, does that make any significant difference in the field? I've been told I would likely be looking at about 30 yards max for the distance from shooting point to target. For about $200 difference is it worth the higher speed?"
398725,misfish,2009-11-02 20:39:00,29133,IMO No.
398765,bassjnkie,2009-11-02 22:16:00,1101," Fps is funny, the higher it is the more cash you spend. the Phenox is 305fps and the Vortex is 330fps, the difference is the weight, stock, and limbs, but 25fps more will not make a difference for hunting purposes, for 3D target I like a little higher speed. For the $200 difference you can buy some great accessories for the crossbow, broadheads, string puller, string remover, quiver, extra arrows etc... My hunting compound is shooting 298fps and I have no problem getting good penetration at 40yrds. But I never had to flig an arrow that far on an animal."
398770,misfish,2009-11-02 22:23:00,29133, Mines 315 fps.Easy to pull and release when you have to uncock.  Leave no dings in the hard wood floor Danial.LOL
398776,Terry,2009-11-02 22:37:00,14456,but will it take down a moose
398780,misfish,2009-11-02 22:44:00,29133, You bet.
398799,AzuluSpookd,2009-11-02 23:15:00,348,"Nope, I have the pheonix. Awesome. Crossbows aren't very quiet, compared to compounds. 30 yards is a great shot. They are unbelievably accurate. I'd do 40 if I had too, but I wouldn't go any further than 40 with any crossbow. Probably would with a compound. You lose a lot of speed after 30 yards with the smaller bolts for xbows, as opposed to the longer compound bolts. IMO "
398801,bassjnkie,2009-11-02 23:19:00,1101, I still feel bad.

398930,Stern Rules,2009-11-03 05:25:00,342, Sorry I don't have a suggestion for you but I have a question about the safety course. Was it an easy course and how long was it? Did you take it at Bass Pro or elsewhere? I am thinking of getting into hunting and have to take those courses.
398931,Jonny,2009-11-03 06:50:00,1380,"A few fps will not make any appreciable difference. A long as it's rated for 150 lb or more it's fine for moose. I took a couple with my Browning Orion. (If you can get one of these 'used' it would be a great buy.)  Make sure that your practice arrows are identical to your hunting arrows and carry the same weight of head. Three or four layers of blue Styrofoam SM make a great target-shooting setup that will stop your practice arrows so you don't have to go searching for them or damage them. I would advise you practice @ 30 yards max.  The one thing I wish I had learned early on, and I'll pass it along to you, is that a red dot sight mounted on your x-bow is a LOT more useful than sight pins. I had to miss a good shot at a moose under low (but legal) light conditions to learn that. I couldn't see the sight pins clearly and shot under the moose's belly into swamp grass. If I had had a red dot, I would have nailed that shot. The moose was not unduly alarmed but by the time I reloaded it was too far away for a second shot. I mounted a red dot as soon as I could after that experience.  Save your money on extra fps and get a red dot. You'll never regret it."
398934,Big Cliff,2009-11-03 09:49:00,6899,"Before you buy one, I would really suggest you take a look at the Middleton Crossbows. They are the hardest hitting, fastest crossbow I could find (rated for 375fps) but when we tested mine we were getting 383 consistantly, made in Canada.  I have had one for 3 years now and love it. The limbs aren't affected by normal heat, ie, you leave it in your car strung and the sun is shining in and it gets hot in the car, no problem, it won't affect the limbs. Their customer service is second to none and they come with a lifetime warranty which they stand behind.  Price worked out to about the same or a little less than Excaliber."
399019,wuchikubo,2009-11-03 17:27:00,1114, The course was an one day course at an instructor's house. The OFAH website has many courses posted for different areas.  My course was 8am to 7pm with the exam. I would say it's not really hard unless you have the mentality that you are thinking to shoot everything in sight or anything out of sight that moves. It did go over some firearm safety items which I didn't really find any interest in but it was good to know just in case.  PM me if you want my instructor's info (located in Stouffville).  Stan

I was meaning to get up there to pay you a surprise visit but a lot of other things have come up and gotten in the way of that plan. I trust you and your wife are doing well and apologize for not asking you in person as I had initially planned to.  I will also look into the Middleton Crossbows.
