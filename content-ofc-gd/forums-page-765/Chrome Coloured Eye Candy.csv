401362,wallacio,2009-11-11 17:24:00,475,"With a little one at home, my Steelheading days are pretty limited at present.  I had a rare full day ""free pass"" on the weekend and wanted to make the best of it.   With the recent relative lack of rain, options in the province were very limited and the few rivers with decent flow and numbers of fish are very, very busy as the word is out.  Last week saw some very localized but significant showers and on a hunch and after some confirmation from a trusted fellow Steelhead addict, we set our sights on one of my all-time favourite destinations.    Sometimes fate smiles upon you and I was over the moon to arrive to find perfect ""Steelhead Green"" conditions and virtually no other anglers.  Here's just a few highlights:        So nice, I had to show her twice!    A real treat - a relatively rare wild non-Lake O Coho:  "
401365,ADB,2009-11-11 17:30:00,444,Nice fish!

401435,solopaddler,2009-11-11 21:17:00,8605,Sweet! It's nice when you make the right choice isn't it? Did Joe get any?
401450,ehg,2009-11-11 22:01:00,2666, Not often one sees a coho looking like this.   Congrats!
401460,wallacio,2009-11-11 22:49:00,475, It sure is!  Even better as we virtually had the place to ourselves...not bad for a weekend.  Joe held his own.   The first fish and the Coho were landed by him.

401893,Paulus,2009-11-13 03:44:00,522,"Nice fish Wallacio, except I think that you submitted them to cruel and unusual punishment by subjecting them to the ""aroma"" of that junky old vest of yours.   I'm not sure that they could have survived, after their release, due to the incredible shock that proximity to that noisome piece of tattered cloth must have brought on!  I'm sure it was a nice vest at one time  teehee   :w00t:  p.-"
401899,steelie hunter,2009-11-13 04:04:00,55,"Beautiful fish! Congrats on the great day, and its even better when you dont have to fish shoulder to shoulder.  I am loving college life with the flexible schedule to get out steelheading, but I know soon enough it will all come to an end"
