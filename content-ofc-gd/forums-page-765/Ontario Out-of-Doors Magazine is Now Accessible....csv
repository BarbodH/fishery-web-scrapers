To this end, OFAH management, after consulting with the Chief Editor of Ontario Out-of-Doors magazine and their field editors, has decided to distribute articles in an electronic format directly to OFAH members with print disabilities.  By providing articles in an accessible electronic format, OFAH members with print disabilities will now be able to access Ontario Out-of-Doors magazine articles in their preferred format (e.g. Braille, synthesized audio or large print).  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) provides electronic texts of Ontario Out-of-Doors articles for the sole use of OFAH members with print disabilities.  No unauthorized copying or distribution is permitted.  Copyright of the text rests with OFAH.  To receive the e-text service, individuals must be a member of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and have a print disability.  To become a member of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and to sign up for the E-Text distribution service, contact:  Ian Deslauriers Member Services Coordinator Club Membership/Services Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters Tel: 705-748-6324 Ext. 250"
