401242,charlied,2009-11-11 03:36:00,584,"Heard on the news that someone or more than 1 person vandalized a war memorial at a Legion! I cannot imagine why someone would do this, if it wasn't for our soldiers...present and past....our country wouldn't be what it is today!  I AM ABSOLUTELY FUMING OVER THIS!!!"
401251,BillM,2009-11-11 04:19:00,17367,This is when an old fashioned ass kicking is COMPLETELY justified.
401266,Stern Rules,2009-11-11 06:28:00,342,You weren't talking about the one in Fredericton were you?
401360,mbosh1980,2009-11-11 17:20:00,349, agreed
401363,wuchikubo,2009-11-11 17:28:00,1114, And after that get them to scrub down and maintain the site for a year or more!
401379,johnnyb,2009-11-11 18:11:00,3413,"Yes, I believe that's the one in Fredericton.  I say they get whatever punishment would have been handed down when the vets they dishonoured were their age...like maybe a visit to the police station to learn what a cat'o'nine tails is"
401400,Dutchy,2009-11-11 19:26:00,416, They don't deserve to be anywhere near a memorial.  Ass-kicking is much more practical.
401436,splashhopper,2009-11-11 21:21:00,2931,http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/nation...article1357429/  Can you imagine how the vet in that picture must feel ?
401496,Mattones,2009-11-11 23:45:00,587,No respect! Most Kids these days have no respect for anything! Just sad to see something like this happen!
401500,misfish,2009-11-11 23:55:00,29133,"The one in Woodbridge had a swastica (sp?) on thiers.They tried to get rid of it,but could still see it during the cerimonies.  Sad sad what has become.  There was an interesting interview on the news last night about,remembering.One soldier from back then said that we/the Canadian country should not push this onto the younger generation. Not sure what to read into that.  Maybe he feels he/they, did what was to be done back then.  Another comment that was made was,what we fought for,was more important then what they are fighting for now. IMO can understand what he is saying."
401595,charlied,2009-11-12 04:03:00,584,Yep thats the one i was talking about!  Was at a ceremony today in Burlington and some Jack arse was booing after the national anthem!!
401618,Handlebarz,2009-11-12 11:33:00,3790,"There was also one in Woodstock WTH is wrong with theses people if it were not for teh vets they would not be here to do this I would like to see there hands cut off for this stuff that might makes otehrs think twice next time.  the night before Nov 11th here's anger in Woodstock after two swastikas were painted on the city's cenotaph overnight, marring the Remembrance Day ceremony.  Although crews tried to remove it, remnants of the swastikas were still visible when veterans and others arrived for the morning ceremony.  Woodstock's fire chief says he's disgusted by the crime and calls the incident ""very disappointing.""  There's no word on possible suspects. Police are continuing to investigate."
401626,siwash,2009-11-12 12:15:00,683,  I think you mean woodstock... i live in woodbridge... that didn't happen here
401642,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-12 13:27:00,3761,"wow, some people just don't care."
401663,NAW,2009-11-12 15:17:00,4022,"More kids need to get into hunting and fishing.  Instead of roaming the streets at night vandalizing, they could be steelheading, or going to bed early, so they can make it to the swamp before sunrise."
401709,Dutchy,2009-11-12 18:21:00,416, Unfortunately I don't think people REALLY know what swastikas represent. Exactly how atrocious the Nazi's were.  They see it as a joke. Its not a good one....
401835,mbosh1980,2009-11-13 00:42:00,349, and they probably aren't using it in the hindu/ buddhist way either.
