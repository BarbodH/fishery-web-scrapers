401469,soupie,2009-11-11 23:06:00,1,"Hey my name's Steve, a avid fisherman just wanted to say hello share with you my first Musky I caught on Sturgeon Lake. I caught this Musky trolling with some friends out in 16ft of water in the last weekend in October. Was the only fish caught that afternoon and was it ever a strong fighter, jumping twice out of the water for me, had to hand land it.  Was a blast and I can say I'm hooked on Musky for next year.     Great to be apart of the community here  Peace, Soupie"
