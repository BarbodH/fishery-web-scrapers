I am looking for ice fishing suit. I can't afford to get something expensive, but in the same time i don't want to get some crappy staff as well. Could you please give me some advise what i suppose to look for? Thanks."

I know almost every year canadian tire will have a mustang suit on sale for a great price.  I would keep my eye out for that sale.  It's the best price for a nice suite you'll find.  I personally like a 2 piece suite so if it get's hot I can just take off the jacket portion and still have the bib pants.  Some like the one piece, you'll have to try one on and see what you like.  Good luck"
