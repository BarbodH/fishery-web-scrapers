This is a different 6 point,and yes,I do believe the rut is on.That neck is huge.     I,ll be out after work Friday and both Sat and Sun.  I think I now know why they go to the stand in al those pics.It,s an old apple tree that I broke down,Maybe the sap. "
401793,bassjnkie,2009-11-12 23:33:00,1101,"The rut is defiantly on around my area. I wish my trail cam would work properly, time for a new one. Brian keep the photos coming. That's a big 6."
401794,Skud,2009-11-12 23:36:00,739,"You would think that six point would have brow tines to make it an eight point. Either way, it looks yummy.  I also thought you put Doe urine in the area to attract them bucks."
401812,Twocoda,2009-11-12 23:53:00,4130,forget the bucks now ...he wouldnt even make good pepperettes.....
401815,misfish,2009-11-13 00:02:00,29133,"  I did,but not there.  Out in the field more.  Crazy eh.   Oh I think he would."
401856,wuchikubo,2009-11-13 01:30:00,1114,"Brian, which trail cam do you use?"
401860,oxcowboy,2009-11-13 01:41:00,544,"the rut is taking off down here as well, i had to watch a real nice 10 pointer cross the field all loved up and in a trance on a hot doe, no calls or rattling could turn him in the slightest.  keep at it fellas.  good luck.  jason"
401872,Leecher,2009-11-13 02:15:00,7832,I hope you went in to retrieve your cam card with some type of ammo? I'm going back this Saturday for one last shot at a buck..... our feeding areas has been unattended for some time now.... only hope for Mr. rack to show up Jacques
