401750,mbac31,2009-11-12 20:14:00,904,Just a note that is someone is interested. These baits are a great choice for Spring Walleye as well as Smallies late fall.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true  These are killer on Quinte Fall and Spring Walleye and at that price why not. http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true  Remember that Le Barons has a sale on this week that its no tax and save another 10% with a club membership. Some great deals  there for the guys that live here in the East. Fishing World had some great deals on gear and lures as well. We all need to save a little money lately and Xmas is coming up so why not.
