The doe.Probly the one that walked out last night at 4:30. I didnt see her til it was too late.Never even heard her come in.    So now the tresspasser.  This is me,just so you know the other guy aint me.    This guy is much smaller and his camo sucks .    Now if I can only catch him in the act."

I guess there are more excuses for not killing Bambi than there are for not catching a fish eh?!!!  ... I'm thinking that in a year or 2 you will spend the rest of your life in the house with the heater or air conditioner running!"
