401588,StoneFly,2009-11-12 03:34:00,574," Erindale Park!!!!  bahahahahahaha,...not my cup of tea, but there are definately fish, if what you are looking for is the city crowd no challenge type of fishing,...GIVER, there are people fishing there ALWAYS unless it is completely blown."
401596,TobascoCat,2009-11-12 04:18:00,4,"There are only 2 or 3 river within 3 hrs driving distance of GTA that are not impacted by rainfall. The rest of the rivers require rain to bring in good # of fish. After a rain, there is a window of opportunity for each river. This could be 1 day after a rain, 2 days after, 3 days after 4 days after, 5 days after and is is different for each river. For example, to go to Bronte in the river and expecting to catch fish this coming Saturday is futile because it hasn't rained for over 10 days.  1 day after a rain I know which rivers to go to. 2 days after a rain I know which rivers to go to. etc. etc. No rain for 20 days, I know which rivers to go to. The more rivers you know and how long they take to get ""green"" the better you odds are of being at the right river at the right time. You want to be on the river when there are lots of fish in there. That the first part. NO matter how good you are at hooking fish, you won't hook any if the fish aren't there.  The second part is being good at getting fish to bite."
401601,BillM,2009-11-12 04:39:00,17367," The guy wants a steelhead, the Credit is a easy place for him to get into something...  The runs are well defined and you'd have to be blind to miss them..  Great place to get the confidence up."
401625,StoneFly,2009-11-12 12:14:00,574,"Bill I was Agreeing with you....I said 'Bahahahahaha' because i have directed this guy there several times.  due to its public nature, it would be the only location I would name.    your right, there are always fish and always fisherpeeps."

401721,craigdritchie,2009-11-12 18:41:00,1586,"Biggest problem with Bronte is that there's just no water left in it. All those new subdivisions in Waterdown and the north end of Burlington have dropped the water level significantly. The only time Bronte flows high enough to attract fish is right after a huge rain. But by the time the water starts to clear, it has dropped to such a low level that legitimate fishing is very difficult. With even modest crowds, it becomes nearly impossible.  Like TonyB, I live within walking distance of Bronte, but gave up fishing it many years ago. Time to fish has become a precious thing for me, so I don't waste it fighting crowds for one or two terrified fish that have been dodging three-prongs since they arrived from the lake.  There are just too many other places that are far more rewarding."

402006,tonyb,2009-11-13 20:07:00,1637," Even hitting Bronte in the perfect post-rain conditions isn't a gaurantee for fish anymore, and that is what is frustrating.  I've experienced a steep decline in success rate over the last 3 years at Bronte, and yet an exponential increase in success when I fish other waters.  I chalk it up to simply having to learn to work extremely hard to catch 1 or 2 fish in a day...so when I fish areas that hold numbers of fish now, I realize that I don't really suck that bad afterall  I've recently had my PB day for numbers of fish this year with 30 to the bank and over 75 hooked...that day made up for the years of Bronte frustration in a matter of minutes.  Pat, don't be so harsh...get out your fishing regulations booklet, roadmap, spend some $ on fuel, and put in some legwork on any of the sizeable tributaries that flow into any of the Great Lakes.  I am betting in no time, you too will find success and that sweet spot that you will want to keep all to yourself.  Tony"
402201,fishinguypat,2009-11-14 21:09:00,547,thanks guys i'm glad  to hear this .... yeah i'm not goin to bronte or credit. during the winter i'm checking out a different stream hehe...in a fishing magazine i read that the credit river has had 1000 + steelhead come in since the last year thanks to CRAA..and that in a few years it will be the best steelhad river in ontario? do you think this will be true?
402224,BillM,2009-11-14 23:45:00,17367, I'll take the 'Geen over the Credit any day...  But that's just personal opinion..

401135,fishinguypat,2009-11-10 23:26:00,547,how's the bronte bite for steelhead?
401142,Twocoda,2009-11-10 23:41:00,4130,up your bronte and i wilmot see your credit and there is no hamony...
401143,BillM,2009-11-10 23:42:00,17367,Go check it out and let us know.
401148,fishinguypat,2009-11-10 23:47:00,547,yeah i did that like 4 times this year can't i ask someone
401169,BrownTown,2009-11-11 00:32:00,103,"According to your last post, even if the bite was hot, the fish have nothing to worry about"
401176,fishinguypat,2009-11-11 00:53:00,547,please ...please i just can't take any more of this nonsense ..
401192,BillM,2009-11-11 01:39:00,17367,"  Dude, go check out the river.  Get a notepad, copy down what the conditions were like, then go home, jump on the net and look at the flow charts.  Soon enough you'll figure out what is good and what isn't..  You honestly think people are going to tell you when the fish are in?  There will be hundreds of people down there...  Think about it."

Dude, just get out there and do it,...I have a buddy who comes out all the time, has been steelheading for a couple years now,..almost never catches a fish while we are smashing them and he is doing almost the exact same thing and we help him like crazy,..but he still comes out as he knows its going to change some day."

""CHECK IT OUT YOURSELF!!?""...i know what you guys are talking about ok"
401262,highdrifter,2009-11-11 05:43:00,2534, Lotsa fish!!!

401282,dobee,2009-11-11 12:28:00,301,there are no fish in bronte.
401287,azebra,2009-11-11 12:50:00,168,"note, go there  i know you hate that one, start at the most legal northern limit to fish, try the runs, riffles, pools, blow downs.and walk south till you get tired or find some fish. hint, rain maybe on saturday... maybe try it on gods day. if you catch my drift! (no pun intended)"

401332,bare foot wader,2009-11-11 15:25:00,1354,"perhaps I'm not familiar with this dude's previous posting history? but asking about how the bite is on a fishing forum....what a fool, I mean the nerve of him to ask such a question on a fishing forum.....  I take it fishingguypat is new to steelheading???....welcome to the number 2 rule: NEVER ask about the bite on a popular spot.....rule number 1: never ask somebody for a spot or access point....steelheaders don't like to share....hahah lol  here's a link for river levels:  http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formnav.asp  as mentioned previously, it takes considerable leg work in order to become successfull....start at hwy 5 and work downstream....I typically will hike (if it's a new creek to me) and look for the deepest pools to fish first and then fish my way up and/or down from them  I find downsizing your baits gets me more bites...small egg sacs(ie 2 salmon eggs or 3 or 4 rainbow eggs), single eggies or beads, various nymphs, etc  get yourself a stream thermometer and take note of the river temps....particularly when you catch a few....trout prefer cooler water but even still when it gets to low 40's and lower even trout slow down....in the fall i find that you don't need to be out there at sun up...my best fising comes late morning and into mid afternoon....when the sun is on the river and warming things up a degree or two  lastly, unless you are an ACTUALLY good float fisherman I'd recommend starting with bottom bouncing.....when the fish get sluggish their strike zone shrinks, you have to be running your setup perfectly if you're float fishing to get inside that window......I feel that bottom bouncing is easier and has more room for error than float fishing  good luck"
