Had pretty high hopes after hearing how well some people did last weekend... Started out bright and early loaded a friends canoe up with the trolling motor and off we went. Tried this and tried that, tried everything in the box lol... Finally after the sun peaked out shortly after noon i got  one 4 and a half pounder. Going to give it a try again tomorrow without the canoe. I'm too big and after 5 hours in this canoe i remembered why i haven't been in one for five years.  "
