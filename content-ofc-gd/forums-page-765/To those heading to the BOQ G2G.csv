401605,mrpike,2009-11-12 04:56:00,151,I am going down for the day on SATURDAY with a friend . Anyone know where the best place to fish from shore would be????  Down by the ferry docks is my best thought.  WHERE would be the best place to meet up with some of you OFNers  . I would like to see some of the catch that comes in. I have only fished the bay in the spring so I am comming down to check it out for next fall. IF its as good as they say I will be there with my boat next year.   THANKS and good luck to all.  PS   IF anyone has room for two in there boat  we would be only to glad to pay our share for a shot on the bay. GOOD luck and play safe.  MR. PIKE
