402075,jaydub,2009-11-14 01:26:00,145,That's one heck of fish Dave!    Can't wait to see the show!!
402091,Marty,2009-11-14 02:10:00,873,"Last week, my 7 year old son asked me if he could go fishing with you.   After seeing that, he wants you to adopt him.   Nicely done."
402119,ohhenrygsr,2009-11-14 03:36:00,947,WELL WORTH THE WATCH.  First they are fishing for bait (jack fish) then they will fish for Goliath bass
402157,Dave Mercer,2009-11-14 14:37:00,148,Glad you like the fish guys I know you will love the show it was awesome! It will be the first show of our new season the first week in Jan 2010. As far as that video what those guys did with that fish is wrong and breaks the law. You can not take them out of the water it the law as it's hard on the fish. That's why I went for a swim with the big girl lol!  Rizzo not sure where you got your info but It's WRONG you don't hand fish them as these things would break your arms! I'd love to see you shove your hands in a hole that has one of these lol! Please let me know how we were cheating lol!  It was an awesome trip and if any of you are looking for the trip of a lifetime this is it and it's only an hour away from Tampa. So it is not a crazy exotic trip that costs a ton. Next time you do the Disney thing with the family save a day for this it's better than any ride at Disney lol! Send me a message at my site and I will hook you up with the info.  Thanks for all of your support as always OFC'ers are great! Dave Mercer
