402259,bigugli,2009-11-15 01:43:00,6138,"I'm Baaack  Thank you for your best wishes. It was  nice to read when I got home.  Been home 2 hours and now catching up on the important things.. Fishing  Had 2 really rough days, but things started turning around fast yesterday.  The Dr. managed to remove a lot of the tissue build up around the spinal cord, but the  recovery process is going to be lengthy. Don't have much feeling in the legs and I rather unsteady,but heck, I just got home.  As for the purdy nurses, I got the ones with the purdy finger bobbles. The nurses were top flight and professional and a pleasure to deal with."
