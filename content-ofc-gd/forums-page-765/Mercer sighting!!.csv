Just then Dave and his buddy Simon pulled up towing a gorgeous Triton. Got to talk to them for a few minutes before we both had to get going. Apparently fishing was 'slow' and they only managed 20 or so fish. Poor guy...lol. Dave was a little under the weather but if you are gonna be sick, you might as well be out fishing. So if you are wondering what a fishing celeb/pro does on his days off when he is sick..apparently he goes out on a big lake and fishes.  Nice seeing you Dave."
