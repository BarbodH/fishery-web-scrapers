821624,chris.brock,2013-12-01 19:40:00,4053,"this could be the first hard water report of the season for OFC?  1.15 kms as the crow flies, from my truck to the lake, I can't fly so I'm guessing I hiked double that distance, around bogs, hills and thick bush,     I broke a sweat hiking, not good on a cold, windy day, I was happy to find 4 to 6 inches of good ice, here's a Trout Junkie tip up waiting for a bite     It was quiet for the first hour, then the bite turned on, 4 to 8 feet of water was where the action was      I tried to use the timer on my camera to photo some of the bigger specimens     there was some good battles bringing in these feisty brookies on a hand line      A nice afternoon, worth the effort  "

821637,GBW,2013-12-01 20:04:00,8460,NICE!  I have never fished for them but I'm sure they would be a blast; with a reel or by hand line to bring them up.
