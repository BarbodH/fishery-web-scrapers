820310,hotsky,2013-11-26 00:53:00,400,I tend to leave at least one fishing rod in the car at pretty much year around.  I recently started wondering if the summers heat or the winters cold temperatures can damage the durability of the rod. Does anyone know if that can do any damage?

I pulled a rod outta my dad's shed that was in there all seasons for about 8 years. Still all worked fine, even the reel still seemed greased which surprised me. Haha"
