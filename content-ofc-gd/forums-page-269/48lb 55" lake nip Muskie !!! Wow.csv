819884,Rich Clemens,2013-11-23 23:17:00,3131,I gotta get up there one of these years. :-).   That is indeed a monster.   Congrats to the angler.
819909,Nipfisher,2013-11-24 01:16:00,2449,"Nice fish. If you read carefully, this one was 54 as well...  Almost 55"". I missed that."
819924,ccmtcanada,2013-11-24 04:11:00,7971,Holy crap!
820128,fishnsled,2013-11-25 02:58:00,3520,What a beast!
820129,Steelheadphycho,2013-11-25 03:20:00,470, Clearly no where near the end I fish........
820173,Muskieman,2013-11-25 15:13:00,2472,"I heard a rumor yesterday that it was caught by Brown Island at the mouth of the French , but again I heard a rumor , also a local guy claims to have landed a 59' weighing in at 56lbs .( no photo)  dead camera batteries , but I do believe that Nipissing may be harboring a WR fish .  Randy"
820177,lew,2013-11-25 15:29:00,12766,but I do believe that Nipissing may be harboring a WR fish .    I think there's about 7 lakes listed that could hold the new WR and Nippissing is definitely one of them.
820255,Steve,2013-11-25 22:48:00,2075,"nip, low, lac seul, ottawa, larry, can't remember if there another.  nip sure can do it!"
820259,manitoubass2,2013-11-25 22:51:00,11391,Lower manitou holds some beasts.
820261,lew,2013-11-25 22:57:00,12766,"nip, low, lac seul, ottawa, larry, can't remember if there another.  nip sure can do it!  Seems to me Eagle Lake is on the list."
820262,manitoubass2,2013-11-25 22:58:00,11391,
820263,lew,2013-11-25 23:00:00,12766,which eagle lake?  The one with the giant muskies
820271,darsky,2013-11-25 23:14:00,586,bet it comes from an anglers boat from Montreal. Many hard core late seasoners here. Some near misses too.
820278,manitoubass2,2013-11-25 23:28:00,11391,
820279,Rich Clemens,2013-11-25 23:30:00,3131,We'll find out if I get up there next year. :-)
820281,lew,2013-11-25 23:32:00,12766,smarta** lol. Well now that narrows it down to 20 or so lakes haha  Let's go with the one west of Dryden LOL
820293,manitoubass2,2013-11-25 23:53:00,11391,
820298,PAZE,2013-11-26 00:20:00,132,"How about those two small little lakes Georgian bay, and lake Erie? you think it might hold a world record?"
820307,Rich Nelson,2013-11-26 00:48:00,332,"Erie, possible, but not likely"
820312,Raf,2013-11-26 00:54:00,3495,"Georgian bay 100% Erie, possible, but not likely  hard to argue with any of the great lakes, a belly full of bullheads and a 4"" rapala."
820324,shimano19,2013-11-26 01:20:00,196,that is an incredible musky. shes a monster
820383,fishindevil,2013-11-26 08:42:00,6254,There have been several big muskies over 60lbs taken from the Ottawa/st. Lawrence rivers in the last few years !!! And my bet that's where the most potential lies for a shot at the world record !!!
820387,Rich Nelson,2013-11-26 12:18:00,332,Really. Show me one.
820392,grizzlybri,2013-11-26 12:50:00,565,"I saw shown a picture this past summer of a angler who caught a 54"" on the Murray Canal at the mouth of Presqu'ile Bay. So I'm sure there are some beasts there also.  But still 55""  beast is awesome, I can't even catch a small musky lol."
820652,casting,2013-11-27 00:56:00,13,what a beast
819676,fishindevil,2013-11-22 22:44:00,6254,Just seen this pic on fb a big girl caught and released on lake nip !!!!

819687,Nipfisher,2013-11-22 22:57:00,2449,"My buddy (clients) has boated 100s of muskie on Nipissing including over 60 this year. I believe he has yet to get a 55""! He has a few that were 54+"" but 55"" and up have eluded him."
819703,Steve,2013-11-22 23:39:00,2075,awesome fish!!!
819705,lew,2013-11-22 23:41:00,12766,"Yeah, that's a real beaut, thanks for posting that Shawn !!  No wonder I love fishing Nip so much"
819707,Joeytier,2013-11-22 23:42:00,3990,First muskie?  Time to retire from muskie fishing!!
819724,mike rousseau,2013-11-23 00:25:00,4661,That's a beast....
819738,bigbuck,2013-11-23 01:41:00,2449,SUPERTANKER!!
819741,Richie Razor,2013-11-23 01:52:00,536,Wow what a fat beast!!! Good on them for releasing the big brute. If I was to land such a behemoth I probably wouldn't be so inclined to do so...
819752,Joey,2013-11-23 02:53:00,9122,"Wow, thanks for posting Shawn.  I know they're in there, ya just gotta find them"
819767,Handlebarz,2013-11-23 12:17:00,3790,Totally awesome musky for sure
819783,Steelheadphycho,2013-11-23 15:21:00,470,So why the heck do I only fish for walleye on that lake...........?!?!?!?!
819791,TJQ,2013-11-23 16:03:00,7806,Wow... where is that original report from????
819804,Bernie,2013-11-23 16:41:00,3190,I wonder which end of the lake it was?
819814,aplumma,2013-11-23 17:21:00,6896,I wonder which end of the lake it was? Bernie it was from the other end no matter which side you fished. lol Nice fish I have fished the Nipissing for 10 years and skunked a few muskie pro's. I am still the king of not catching a muskie.   Art
819817,Steve,2013-11-23 17:26:00,2075,"Bernie it was from the other end no matter which side you fished. lol  Art, now that's funny."
819819,Bernie,2013-11-23 17:28:00,3190,LOL Art!I bet it was at my end
819824,Nipfisher,2013-11-23 17:50:00,2449,"No Bernie, I recognise that tree there, and it is definitely the other side of the lake."
819831,RangerGuy,2013-11-23 18:46:00,564,"Wow! Man that is huge! First fish!! Crazy!  Thanks, for sharing!"
819856,Rich Nelson,2013-11-23 20:49:00,332,"Nice fish. If you read carefully, this one was 54 as well..."
