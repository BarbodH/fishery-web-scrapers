St. Peter said, ""I'd like to get you guys in now, but our computer's down. You will have to go back to Earth for about a week, but you can't go back as priests. What'll it be?""  The first priest says, ""I've always wanted to be an an eagle, soaring above the Rocky Mountains .""  ""So be it,"" says St. Peter, and off flies the first priest in a flurry of feathers.  The second priest mulls this over for a moment and asks, ""Will any of this week 'count' St. Peter?"" ""  ""No I told you the computer's down, There's no way we can keep track of what you are doing.""  ""In that case"" says the second priest, ""I've always wanted to be a stud.""  ""So be it"" says St. Peter, and the second priest disappears.  A week goes by, the Holy computer is fixed, and the Lord tells St. Peter to recall the two priests. ""Will you have any trouble locating them?"" he asks.  ""The first one should be easy,"" says St. Peter, ""He's somewhere over the Rockies in Alberta , flying with the eagles. But the second one could prove to be more difficult.""  ""Why`s that?"" asks the Lord  ""He's on a snow tire, somewhere in Newfoundland"".  HH"
