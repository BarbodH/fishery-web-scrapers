821170,Christopheraaron,2013-11-29 20:15:00,3525,I've heard some guys are getting out in minden this weekend. Apperantly one guy has already gone through so be careful! Make sure you post a report when you get back

821177,Nipfisher,2013-11-29 21:20:00,2449,"This is what Lake Nosbonsing looks like today. 2""+ at shore.  "
821182,jeffw,2013-11-29 21:40:00,267,"I will be out in the minden area for trout. I was on 5"" of ice today but in less then 2ft of water. Cheers jeff"

821184,jeffw,2013-11-29 21:54:00,267,Close to toronto. I didn't want to go out past the 2ft depth because the ice out there was recent.
821185,Christopheraaron,2013-11-29 22:01:00,3525,"sweet! in that case  I'm gonna try this weekend  Anyone know the thickness on VB, another week?"
821243,Joeytier,2013-11-30 02:16:00,3990,"There's safe ice to be had around here, but also no shortage of dangerous ice.  I'll try my hand for some small-lake specks this weekend but will wait at least another week for anything larger.  It's gonna be a looong season, and i'm in no hurry"
821265,Freshtrax,2013-11-30 05:46:00,2215,Wish I could make the hike.  I'm pretty sure I know where your headed.

821327,Big Cliff,2013-11-30 17:42:00,6899,"Sturgeon Lake (Goose Bay area) as of yesterday 7"" of ice out to the green marker bouy (521' off my dock).  DO NOT take this as an indication that the ice is safe, I am sure there are plenty of areas that aren't and I take no responsibility for anyone going out even in front of my place. This was tested under the strictist safety conditions, flootation suit rope, and two guys standing by with a boat just in case. I still don't trust it!"

Any wet spots out there?"
821347,Sinker,2013-11-30 18:21:00,8692, Crazy eh? Tuesday I was out there in a boat!! You probably heard us shooting  S.
821360,Big Cliff,2013-11-30 19:14:00,6899,That's still pretty awesome! Any wet spots out there?  There was a very little bit of slush just at the shore but that was it. Crazy eh? Tuesday I was out there in a boat!! You probably heard us shooting  S. Didn't you just text me on Sunday to ask about ice conditions? Goose Bay was frozen right across in front of our place at that point. Where were you hunting?
821362,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-30 19:24:00,4399,It`s early whats the rush...wait a bit too be sure especially if your by yourself!!!
821410,Sinker,2013-12-01 00:14:00,8692,Right on the edge of the ice in the middle of the lake  I'm surprised you didn't hear us. Tuesday morning. Got 10...  S.
821411,Richie Razor,2013-12-01 00:20:00,536,"Lots of guys here with a chubby thinking about ice fishing..... RELAX. I don't think it's really safe anywhere unless your around north bay/Halliburton areas as of this point in time. Guys need to relax this will be a long season, and by late feb you'll be wishing it was the may opener!!"
