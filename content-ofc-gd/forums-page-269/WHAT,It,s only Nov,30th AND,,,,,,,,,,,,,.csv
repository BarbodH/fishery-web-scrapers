821372,Terry,2013-11-30 19:57:00,14456,"funny, Brian had to remind me to walk in our foot prints on the way back in, a minor brain fart  but yeah, we had ropes,  picks, floater suits spuds and know how to test the ice  the thing that scares me the most is when a guy, 2 kids and a dog sees us out there and just starts walking out in the general area we are with no regard to ice conditions or personal safety didn't happen today but has happened in the past"
821373,misfish,2013-11-30 20:04:00,29133,"Funny how many pm,s I got today. All my answers were,sorry,I will not be the one that said go.  Know where your going,know your limits. 4 inches of black ice,Im walking comfortably. We stepped and chipped all our way out and abound.  I didnt post to say it was safe for all or any to go. I posted this report,as it the earliest we both had ever been out.  Terry and I have been around the block a few times. I trust his thinking,and Im sure he does mine.  Knowing now, by reading other boards,,the word is out.  Be safe,know yer limits.  Maybe I shouldnt of posted this at all. Some guy reading .OH THOSE GUYS ARE OUT,IT,S SAFE, goes through and I,ll feel like a  Try to spell my name right will ya.LOL"

821393,irishfield,2013-11-30 22:26:00,26272,"I'm still trying to figure out which is Brian.. which is Terry ! ""Cant' live with'm.. can't shoot'm !"""
821394,Rich,2013-11-30 22:45:00,3927,I could probably go on a couple of ponds in town... But i'll wait! Nice to see the north is ready though!
821395,Terry,2013-11-30 22:49:00,14456,well we only found one lake I would think most are not ready
821398,Fisherman,2013-11-30 22:58:00,7201," Damit,knew I should of got the white one. Hahahaha, nuttin that a couple of old bedsheets can't fix...  Maybe you can borrow one from Ma Bell, nobody would think twice then, just normal goofing off instead of working.."
821405,Rizzo,2013-12-01 00:06:00,4754,My kids have been skating for 3 days now on our homemade rink in Kitchener...crazy.
821407,limeyangler,2013-12-01 00:09:00,5204,Great stuff Brian….very jealous…can't believe you guys are on the ice b4 me!!!!!
821635,chris.brock,2013-12-01 20:00:00,4053,"looks like a fun day guys, I bet it sure felt good to be back on the ice again"
821647,misfish,2013-12-01 20:51:00,29133,"Thats what happens when yer buds. Not that kind a BUD.LOL  LOL    I know another surface thats safe Roger.   Glad the kids are having fun.   Oh Im sure you will make up for it,and have me sullivating soon enough Simon. Tease.LOL    That it did Chris. Nice to see yer outing was nice as well..   After driving this morning to do some scouting,I did find a few lakes that were not safe yet.  Couch  Not happening anytime soon.    From a lake I was hoping to fish this morning.  Not happening.. 10 ft from shore. I heard cracking,and was off like a scared jack rabbit.    What I found? Where the snow fell,the winds blew,the lakes are not safe. I could see different stages of ice formation on all of them.  We were lucky enough to have the ice we did yesterday. Froze over for 8 days,and the temps were well below -10 all those nights.  Looking at the temps coming,I my just grab the float rod for bit.  We got a tease,and I,ll take it.  Before we all know it,we,ll be slaying lakers and whites and perch and thos pesky herring which we cant keep.  Be safe all.and enjoy yer winter wonderland,when it comes."
821654,GBW,2013-12-01 21:15:00,8460,Glad to see (got the msg yesterday you 2 were out) that all and all it was just good to get out on the ice that was deemed safe at the time in the area.
821304,misfish,2013-11-30 16:45:00,29133,"WERE   ICEFISHING     I couldnt believe it when I checked a lake and there was 4 inches of good black ice.  We did run into a lake that seemed to have a major weed die off,cuz we couldnt find any and the water looked real murky. Visability was 4 ft in 15 fow. Not good for us,but we got out the earliest we have ever in all our years.  New Ice armour suit was perfect. What a difference from a bulky one piece suit. New HH under wear is primo warm.  New eskimo hub 2 man,well,it,s a one man to me,but it will do what I need it to do,and thats to keep me warm and out of the wind.          The screws anchors that come with the hub are so easy to turn in by hand and hold awesome.  "
821307,Terry,2013-11-30 16:50:00,14456,"you mean you were on the ice today  are you nuts   there it was said  yup lots of good black ice, but not lots of fish...it was great getting out  i was afraid we might have to drive to north bay to find god ice, glad we found it much closer"
821308,tb4me,2013-11-30 16:51:00,3295,Where are the fish?

821351,davey buoy,2013-11-30 18:37:00,5505,Mines been ready since the end of March last season.lol.
821354,misfish,2013-11-30 18:51:00,29133,Im sure it will be a busy place Sunday morning now. LMAO  Like I care. Just have fun and be safe.
821363,Big Cliff,2013-11-30 19:24:00,6899,"Be safe are the key words here! Someone will push the limit for the sake of getting out there, someone will pay with their life. Happens every year! When we tested the ice here it was three guys, roped together, 50' apart flotation suits and a boat in tow. Tested the ice every 50' or so. Just remember the next step could be your last step. Perhaps I am over cautious but there is a very slim chance that you will ever read that Big Cliff went through the ice and drowned. I haven't lived this long by being stupid LOL."

Unfortunatly there are those that seem to THINK they are smart and end up paying the price. (Just like no bank rober thinks they will ever be caught. The jails are full of them LOL.)  I know you and would follow you out almost anywhere (walking in your foot steps)!  Just glad to hear you had a good time and you were safe!"
