It just made me think of what i was missing back in England but how we were in the process of making new memories for the future in our new home across the sea with our own family.  Jack and Mum and yours truly put the tree up this morning and of course i had the camera running….put this together, i have watched it a few times already today and it has really put me in the xmas mood.       Hope you all have a great festive season…...   Peace , love and chocolate!   Limey and family."
