820056,bucktail,2013-11-24 20:39:00,1857,"Just wondering how the launchs were in Quinte with ice ?  They should be fine I think but you never know, thinking tuesday maybe.......   Thanks  D"
820057,Terry,2013-11-24 20:41:00,14456,"yesterday they were all ice free  , today there was some minor ice along shores   bring salt for food and kitty litter for ramps but you should be good everywhere right now"
820061,Steve,2013-11-24 21:09:00,2075,"scott walcott just cancelled the remainder of his trips for the year due to picton bay freezing.  it hasn't froze yet, but looking at the next five days, his feeling is its going to freeze very very shortly.  when we fished our trips picton bay was always frozen.  so we used the ferry, then when it froze, we used pryners."
820062,Roy,2013-11-24 21:19:00,13728,Kitty litter works as well as salt on boat ramps and will not cause as much damage to our waterways.  Just sayin'.
820148,Sinker,2013-11-25 05:10:00,8692,"Might be going tuesday as well. Shouldn't be a problem, but these temps aren't looking good. I'll be the guy blasting ducks while you fish. Sorry about the noise lol...."
820226,Terry,2013-11-25 21:06:00,14456,I just received a photo of picton harbour   1/2 to 1 inch of ice... frozen  over... man that's fast
820250,Steve,2013-11-25 22:34:00,2075,i figured scott wasn't about to give up money that quickly.  be careful out there folks....ferry and pryners it is.
820251,Terry,2013-11-25 22:36:00,14456,"it was open yesterday when I was there, amazing how quickly it froze"
820274,Sinker,2013-11-25 23:20:00,8692,It always just takes one night to freeze over. Sucks that its so early!  S.
820326,bucktail,2013-11-26 01:35:00,1857,"Man that is early and with this forecast it might be the earliest ever, being from the area originally the earliest I ever remember guys on ice, fishing Potters creek area is Dec 8th approx.  This might beat that......wow"
820393,RangerGuy,2013-11-26 12:50:00,564,Man what a downer LOL!.. I was hoping to get out atleast once more... I'm so torn this time of year...Hunt ducks OR Fish Quinte LOL!  Not a bad problem to have I guess.
820609,Sinker,2013-11-27 00:26:00,8692,I heard a lot of the ice blew out yesterday.
820711,Stoty,2013-11-27 03:59:00,2910,Still a few launches that should be fine..... Ferry/Bath/Priners
820741,Headhunter,2013-11-27 14:17:00,5703,"Depending on how much sonw they got down there, the ferry launch could be toast. The plows usually push the snow right into the lauch area at the ferry, blocking access. Just a word to the wise. HH"
820818,Steve,2013-11-27 23:00:00,2075,"i remember spending a full morning, with a freaking shovel, clearing the mess they create infront of the ferry launch.  i made it just wide enough for my boat....  as I was pulling out a fellow with a 20' boat complained that I only made it wide enough for my boat....  I told him to widen it himself.  next morning i went to launch, he was stuck. he tried to reverse through a locked everything up.  i just jumped on the ferry and continued my way to pryners as he commented that it wasn't fair I wouldnt help him shovel himself out....  lazy bugger."
