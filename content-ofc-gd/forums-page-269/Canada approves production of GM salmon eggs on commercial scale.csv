In horticulture, there is lot of tissue splicing of plants and trees, but the seed is either sterile or it reverts back to it's parent species for the most part. Hence most propagation is through taking rooted cuttings. Gene splicing and tampering with DNA sequencing may prove one day to have benefit. However in the drive to push profit, industry, and government,always looks for the short gain while ignoring the possible long term consequence. No one wants to wait while long term effects and potentials are studied. Imagine what harm could have been avoided if they had performed long term usage studies on such wonderful inventions as DDT or Thalidomide. What really happens is that a new product gets fast tracked for public consumption, after 5 years of testing, and gets pulled after the long term consequences have already reared their ugly heads."

820817,tb4me,2013-11-27 22:49:00,3295,"Heres the deal with Gene manipulation as opposed to selective breeding within north America,particularly within Canada. Hoprfully no one is sorry I post this but here`s my thoughts The Canadian government's oversight of the health implications of GMO foods is based on an outdated and refuted view of gene function. When you insert a gene - when you randomly throw this thing in there, they don't know ahead of time where it's going to land. The researchers don't know how many copies will be inserted, or what other genes it will affect, or will affect it. We now know that the position of a gene is critical to how it functions, and side effects of this are unpredictable and could be drastic Canada's regulatory system relies on companies to provide their own experiments and risk assessment. To determine safety of a product, Health Canada uses a concept called substantial equivalence. No Canadian GM submissions have ever been rejected. Neither is Canadian regulation transparent to the public. The Canadian public has no say in approval of GMOs. Independent scientists can't evaluate feeding studies the Ag Biotech companies submit because they are deemed confidential. The Canadian regulatory system is supporting the biotechnology industry ahead of the health and welfare of Canadian consumers and farmers. It is no different than in the US GM Salmon has just been approved for Canada – it contains DNA from an eel spiced into Salmon for commercial fisheries. It is my understanding that there have not been any GM crops that purposefully contain animal genomes. However there have been numerous studies that show problems with animals who are fed a constant diet of GM feed. In addition, rBST is a genetically synthesized peptide hormone that is usually produced by a cows’ pituitary gland. Milk from rBST-treated cows is chemically similar to traditional milk. Both have very similar levels of protein, fat, and sugar. A study also indicated that both sources of milk had comparable levels of vitamins and minerals. Milk from rBST-treated cows is not, however, chemically identical to traditional milk. Milk from rBST-treated cows contains slightly elevated levels of hormones such as BST, and IGF1. Cows treated with rBST have a substantially higher rate of mastitis and more often require antibiotics. As for assertions that GM crops have reduced pesticide and herbicide use – nothing could be further from the truth! See http://www.nlpwessex.org/docs/benbrook.htm Scientists and government agencies approved a variety of chemicals and drugs and told us they were extensively tested and were safe. They include asbestos, DDT, PCB, Lead, MTBE, Dioxin, Agent Orange, Dalkon shield, and Thalidomide to name a few. Fortunately for us science also ultimately proved these things to be unsafe - Science is proving that GMO’s are not the answer as well - Despite what the chemical companies who are spearheading the GMO revolution are telling you, these GMOs are requiring farmers to buy more of their chemical pesticides, not less. A 2012 paper concluded that the rise of glyphosate-resistant “superweeds” in the wake of the GMO revolution has actually increased pesticide use in the last 15 years by 183 million kilograms, or 7%. The study estimated that if new strains of GM corn and soybeans are approved for commercial use, herbicide use could increase by a whopping 50%. In his 2012 study, Dr. Charles Benbrook determined over a 16 year period that Herbicide-tolerant crops worked extremely well in the first few years of use, but over-reliance led to shifts in weed communities and the emergence of resistant weeds that have, together, forced farmers to incrementally – • Increase herbicide application rates (especially glyphosate), • Spray more often, and • Add new herbicides that work through an alternate mode-of-action into their spray programs. Each of these responses has, and will continue to contribute to the steady rise in the volume of herbicides applied per acre of HT corn, cotton, and soybeans. HT crops have increased herbicide use by 527 million pounds over the 16-year period (1996-2011). In 2011, about 90 million more pounds of herbicides were applied than likely in the absence of HT, or about 24% of total herbicide use on the three crops in 2011. There are now two-dozen weeds resistant to glyphosate, the major herbicide used on HT crops, and many of these are spreading rapidly. Millions of acres are infested with more than one glyphosate-resistant weed. The presence of resistant weeds drives up herbicide use by 25% to 50%, and increases farmer-weed control costs by at least as much. The biotechnology-seed-pesticide industry’s primary response to the spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds is development of new HT varieties resistant to multiple herbicides, including 2,4-D and dicamba. These older phenoxy herbicides pose markedly greater human health and environmental risks per acre treated than glyphosate. Approval of corn tolerant of 2,4-D is pending, and could lead to an additional 50% increase in herbicide use per acre on 2,4-D HT corn. In order for Bt corn work the corn borer still has to ingest the crop – I lknow farmers that live in Illinois and I can tell you that Monsanto’s Bt corn did not stop the European Corn Borer there and my farmer friends who did buy Monsanto’s Ht corn found resistant weeds after the 2nd harvest. Bt and Ht crops are not designed to increase more yield – they are designed with defense mechanisms in place – that is all it is. Ht is designed to withstand the application of glyphosate. There is nothing in Ht crops or Bt crops that could possibly increase yields.  Does this mean I think that all GM is bad? Absolutely not! I think there can be some amazing things accomplished through responsible technology. Their are some risks to your health regarding Golden Rice that could be minor, or could be major. The absence of animal testing data on genetically modified rice, or “Golden Rice” is worrying because Golden Rice is made to overproduce beta carotene, and studies show that some retinoids made from beta carotene are toxic and can cause birth defects. Ingesting too much Golden Rice could also give you an overdose in vitamin A which could lead to Hypervitaminosis which can lead the body to have toxic symptoms. Some effects of Hypervitaminosis are: birth defects, liver abnormalities, and reduced bone density that could result in Osteoporosis. When pharmaceutical drugs are tested for safety, they are tested on animals first. If no harmful effects occur with animals, then testing on humans may begin. Golden Rice has never been subjected to feeding on animals. It is therefore criminally irresponsible to test it on humans at all. “Golden Rice proven not safe to eat” (“Golden Rice: A dangerous experiment”, 2009) People die every year for lots of reasons but they do not die from eating organic foods. There are not any death certificates that say “death by GMO consumption.” Nor are there certificates that state “death by organic consumption.” Big Agri  somehow thinks trying to prove that GMO crops are “safer” than organic, because they were GMO. To insinuate that GMO crops are protected from food-borne disease contamination is ridiculous. There is research to support that farm management practices commonly used by organic farmers or conventional farmers either encourage or discourage food-borne disease outbreaks, none of these findings are absolute. No side can claim they can prevent such outbreaks completely. Using the bean sprout tragedy as a way to convince people that organic is unsafe is absurd. I hope I helped answer your questions, Now you know just how passionate about this I am."

Would you own a company that raised free range chickens that lost money? So now we have you buying a better product that is costing you more you now need to make more money so you ask for a raise.

Ive seen this in other areas of our life and unless your privy to ""real"" double blind placebo trials that are NOT funded by those that profit from a favourable outcome, you really have no idea, nor do i. When i studied to be a nutritional consultant practitioner, and organic chemistry etc, my eyes were opened to some really strange outcomes of science, that the general public would have no idea was even happening. A quick example would be vitamin e. ask ten people what they think of vitamin e, and all ten will probably say ""yeah, that a healthy vitamin"". A few might say "" oh yeah thats an anti oxidant, good to combat illness and disease"". But i guarantee not one of them says "" vitamin e is a great anti oxidant for general health and well being, but it must be natural tocopherol and not synthetic, because the synthetic version is mirrored, and thus backwords. The body doesnt recognize ""backwards vitamin e"" and it might actually stimulate an immune response not favourable to human health"""

My line of thought is you will not stop profit no matter what you do it is the driving factor for both the consumer and the producer. If the company can produce a chicken that is cost per pound cheaper by chemical or by genetically modifying they will do it and you (meaning all consumers) are forcing them to do it. Few people would pay for a better product if they felt like they could not get someone else to pay for it. In other words take on an additional expense without knowing how it is going to be paid for. It is when a person can ignore the past statement when they become willingly debted to either a person or credit company. Now we have to look at the production side we as investors are the driving force behind less expenses with better profits to the stockholders. Without advances in production we do not have the land or capacity to feed people the old fashion way where it takes 3/4 acres to bring 1 sheep to market. Chickens raised here at our farm (faux Farm) are here for the eggs and are also free range cost.... wait for it 3 times as much per egg and 300% more room. it takes 20 chickens to keep 6 adults in casual egg use with this method. For there to be a profit  to support a company of art's eggs is $11.25 per dozen.... the best I can get with this method is $5.00 a dozen from the public. The data just does not support a business model that supports mass produced organic produce.    Art

The prices on these hormone free and free range products have dropped rapidly in recent years as there is now a competitive market.

Schneiders has an entire line of all their products mirrored in a hormone/preservative free version called Country Naturals. And their sister Maple Leaf has ""natural selections"" the same thing.

Many people are already being sued bankrupt by laws that inhibit the use of seeds for medium sized and large scale open farming. In other words we live in a system within corporate society that is slowly, but blatantly obviously taking away our rights to bare fruit so to speak. Thus my concern for GMO anything. Patents pending and patents awarded are allowing huge corporations to control our food supply and thats just flat out dangerous. Illegal to use a seed you want to use? Seriously think about the implications of that. That in itself should be a crime, and never should happen to begin with. We dont trust the government with our tax dollars, why would we trust them with our food???? You hit the nail right on the head..This why its important to keep these seed banks running and why its also important to keep growing them, even if its only for our personal use..Like I said earlier once they control the food they control us. People are to lazy or asleep to figure out whats happening right under our noses. Weather GMO are good or bad is honestly irrelevant right now we should be more worried that our farmers cant grow whats left in the silo come spring due to patent laws..Now look further down the road when these companies start patenting genes perfected in labs for humans..Those genes go into our bodies, when we reproduce does that mean we have to pay someone to have kids?
