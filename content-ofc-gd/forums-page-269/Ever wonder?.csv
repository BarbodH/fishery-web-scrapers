820171,lew,2013-11-25 14:59:00,12766,"Our old family deer camp for many years was an abandoned farm near the s/e corner of Algonquin Park. My mom was born and raised in a little town called Killaloe about 35 miles from there. Her old uncles checked the archives for the history of the farm and found it was built about 1825.  I started going there around 1956 and as you can somewhat see in this picture the barn is fairly intact and the walls of the house on the left are standing but the roof has collapsed.  This place is isolated even now but close to 200 years ago it must have been unbelievable and I've often thought about how tough his his life must have been  living in such isolation. Even today there's absolutely nothing around 'cept trees and water and the nearest hiway is 10 miles away.  Those 2 buildings are long gone now and nothing more than a mound in the earth, but I was still about to slog thru the bush a few years back and find the place....lotsa great memories.    When I was a kid in the 50's I used to visit my family in Killaloe and well remember how different it was from the city. They had the big old wood stove in the kitchen that was used for both cooking and heating the house and there was no indoor plumbing other than the hand pump in the kitchen.  Tough life but it made for some tough people too."

He isn't sharing any of it just yet, can't wait to see how we used to live.  Reading the stories above, I really find it interesting how dependent people were on fish for food and how no one concerned too much about the species, only the amount of protein."
820182,bigugli,2013-11-25 15:49:00,6138,"Fish was readily available, and could be had fresh most days. Secondly, there was no expenditure of resources, effort, or crops.

Pop fished and hunted seal for 9 months a year which left Nan home to raise all of them and do the work. for years they even had a boarder to help with expenses. his family moved from their village to a nearby island in an 18' dory. The whole family, belongings, cookstove and everything. My dad still gets upset when he tells that story as they did not have enough room for his pet goat.

Dad would say what better food is there then what we grow right here in the garden, raise in the barn or in the pasture. We had chickens, hogs and beef cattle; that we raised not just for us to eat; but all the seasonal people that boarded with us during harvest. My mom cooked three meals a day for about 20 people; plus a mid morning and mid afternoon snacks for all the workers. I can still hear my mom telling me what she needed from the garden for the next meal she was preparing. Or sending me to the chicken coop to collect the eggs for that morning's breakfast. That brings back another memory; that frigging rooster, he use to chase me out of the coop and half way back to the house; pecking at my heels all the way. LOL It's funny now but when you're 6 or 7 years old and the rooster is about as tall as you; it got your attention pretty quick. I know this isn't the extreme as some of you guys have mentioned; but I know we lived a lot healthier life then; we were doing the organic thing before anyone ever coined the phrase.  Dan."
820905,bigugli,2013-11-28 13:25:00,6138,"Does not have to be extreme, Dan. You're right about eating out though. Until 1970, we never went out or ordered take out, unless we were travelling .Even then, Gram used to pack a mean picnic basket. There was always all the fixings for sandwiches, slaw and tater salad, hard boiled eggs, etc... We were never hungry. However, in 1970 we had moved down to Toronto suburbia, just 5 minutes away from Canada's first McDonald's restaurant on Keele St. Stepfather thought it was the greatest place on earth. Keele st., from Finch down to Shepherd,  was ""restaurant road"" just outside the airbase. And Gord insisted we try them all. McD's, A&W, RedBarn, DQ,  Ponderosa, Harveys, BurgerKing, etc... My Gram would just shake her head. Mind you Gram did have a weakness for fish and chips from Chico's, kitty corner across from Honest Ed's, and she always took me to the Woolworth's lunch counter when we went to downtown Toronto, but those were full days away from home. Going to Downtown Toronto was an adventure back then."

I kept the stock and froze it for future use. It was a simple dinner but obviously delicious.  As much as possible, we've been trying to simplify our food by foraging, hunting and even breeding rabbits. More to come, including pheasants and/or chickens and gardens. But really, we'll likely always depend at least 80% on grocery stores.  Ever wonder how much effort and resourcefulness it would have taken a couple hundred years ago to feed a family, likely a LARGE family and the things we would be without? I mean, where would I get spinach or any fresh leafy greens at this time of year? And hunting a bird wouldn't be this easy.

Food is no doubt a full time job if we went back old school"
820120,bigugli,2013-11-25 02:23:00,6138,"Refrigeration and freezers have certainly made things easier. But we did have similar options even 200 years back. They just required more work and planning. Your yard was for growing garden veggies. No cabanas, ornamental plantings or swimming pools. If you owned a house, you had a cold cellar. No problem keeping root crops and apples til April in there. Your wife also dried foods, or canned intensely. I still put away 100+ jars of pickles, preserves and fruit for winter every year. Sugaring off in early spring was a necessary ritual. it was your source for sugar during the year, and any surplus was bartered at the general mercantile for those things you could not produce yourself. Meat was dealt with in three ways. Smoke and cure, or salt and dry, was by far the easiest, but still a 1-2 day process. Pickling, but the Mrs had to really know what she was doing. Folks I knew, growing up, were still pickling herring and smelt from Simcoe in the early 70's . man were they good. There was a refrigeration, of sorts. There was the ice house. A cabin, 1/2 buried in the ground built of thick timber. Seams grouted with thick wads of moss or peat. In winter, the men went out with ice saws and cut huge slabs of ice that were placed in the huts to the ceiling. A space tween the wood and ice was packed with sawdust. The rafters were also packed with insulating of a fashion. You could then keep meat hung in there for months without spoiling. In cities, companies sold blocks of ice to be placed in an ice box to keep food from spoiling. In cities many went to the baker for bread. The norm was to bake fresh bread once or twice a week. Every culture has it's own version of hard tack or biscuit for when grain for fresh bread was in short supply. For Finn's it was rye ring or Reikäleipä. Others have rusks, hard tack, etc... I still practice some of the old world recipes it was all much more labour intensive, yes. The focus on living was to survive. Fishing was not a hobby, it was a chore. Fish were food, not playthings. People certainly did not have the leisure time they enjoy currently in Western society."
820124,Rod Caster,2013-11-25 02:38:00,5784,"Thanks for that Bruce.  I find it funny how back then you needed to do those things to sustain and not die, and yet nowdays you'd lose money doing it. I mean,... if I ever quit my job to self sustain, well I couldn't afford my property and my children (6 months away) couldn't keep up with the modern world. Sure makes it hard to even consider reverting to the old ways. It's our own fault/choice but wow we are enslaved to corporations and governments."

I'm not even 40 and I still remember fetching buckets of water from the brook beside the house in the middle of winter, and heating them on the woodstove to have A bath when I was a kid.

820150,bigugli,2013-11-25 05:25:00,6138,"Back into the conversation, was just tying some more worm harnesses.  I'm not saying all modernization is bad. Truck and tractor are just an improvement over horse and wagon. Both have costs to use them. Modernization does make things easier and allows us to be more productive. It takes a day to buck up a face of firewood with the old cross cut or swede saw. I've done it. Only takes 1 hour with a decent chainsaw. I used to be able to split wood as fast as a mechanical splitter, but only for the first hour. A computer, if seen and used as a tool/resource for communication or information, is a library at your fingertips. You don't need the gamer equipment and programs. Sinker's upbringing is no different from thousands who grew up outside the city right into the 70's. Drawing water from the well. Running out to the ""Honey House"" on a cold winter's night to answer nature's call. Uncle Johnny didn't install running water until 1972. We didn't have great means growing up. By the age of 8 Gram had taught me to sew enough to mend a hole in my trousers or darn my socks. I could also knit my own mitts and scarf. Fish 'was' food, and we caught and ate a lot of it. As a family we entertained ourselves playing cards and board games together. We watched television together as a family Sunday evenings. Today, My wife watches TV constantly, whereas I can't stand most of the drivel that is allegedly ""quality programming. There was no such thing as bored with nothing to do. There was always something to apply your energies to, if you couldn't make up your mind, Mom would find something, whether you liked it or not"

In rural life it takes a family to survive and thrive."
820154,manitoubass2,2013-11-25 06:12:00,11391,"K, serious question. If members here were fishing solely as a means to feed their families, what would you be fishing for? Myself id take pike first, sturgeon second. Pike for immediate eating and smoking/pickling, then sturgeon just based on sheer size for smoking. In these circumstances a good sturgeon would go along way in terms of healthy fats and protein. I watched a documentary on a russian fellow, he was a trapper. Him and a group made a nice living until they were basically shunned by the government, but they continued to live where they were and fish/hunt/trap with minimal tools. It was pretty cool. Seemed like they ate a literal ton of pike though"
820160,bigugli,2013-11-25 13:04:00,6138,"We ate what we caught, growing up. Pike and sheephead were great for moujakka (chowder). Nothing lit up my Gram's and my great Aunt's eyes more than when I would walk in the door with a fresh pike. I would kill for a bowl of Gram's fish head soup. It was only much later that I learned to filet them. Bass, walleye and perch were staples. Then there were lakers , whitefish, pannies, smelt. My one uncle, and some of his pals, would go out and catch loads of coarse fish like cats, gar, bowfin, herring, just for the smokehouse. You also have to realize that limits were much more liberal then. The limit on whitefish was 25.  Living in the bush, or farming are lifestyle choices, not simply career paths. You have to plan out your days and weeks carefully with lots of cushion for the unexpected and nature's surprises. I just got my weed cloths up off the ground Friday morning, despite being saturated or under water. If I had waited til this morning, they'd be frozen in until spring. Really screws up the schedule. I try to turn soil in the fall, it may have to wait until spring. Wood gathering has to happen every week. You need wood for cooking, for heat, for chores. Look at 10 bush cords per year as a starting base."
820164,Sinker,2013-11-25 14:01:00,8692,"For us on the east coast is was cod or nothing. We always had herring, mackeral and capelin salted, smoked or canned as well.  Moose and birds were the meat staples.  Grow your potatoes and other root vegtables, and keep them in the root cellar for the winter. We had a couple sheep, and usually one cow that we butchered in the late fall, and hung frozen in the storage shed all winter.
