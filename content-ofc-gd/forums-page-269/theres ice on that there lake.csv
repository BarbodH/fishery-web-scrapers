821155,Terry,2013-11-29 18:43:00,14456,No and to be honest I did not even walk on it. I only agreed with Wayne cause it seemed funny. Went back today and the ice is gone and a couple of boats were launched.  Oh well
821159,Acountdeleted,2013-11-29 19:17:00,2562,"No time for perch this year. Walleye, pike, trout. Soooo much trout. Oh and burbot."

821190,misfish,2013-11-29 22:13:00,29133,I know why they are out there. End of season. I would of loved to be out there today.

821005,muskymatt,2013-11-28 22:54:00,2608,"Freezing up quite nicely in Ottawa and area, the next couple nights will see -24 to -26 temps. Looks like we might be fishing before xmas."
821009,Joey,2013-11-28 23:23:00,9122,"Woohoo, might get an early start this year"
821010,irishfield,2013-11-28 23:23:00,26272,"We're always fishing before Christmas Matt.. but I was hoping for it to be in a boat before Muskie closes on the 15th!! Looking like I might have to go sharpen up the auger and get ready for my usual trip with Lloyd and Terry to a little lake we know that we're usually ice fishing before Christmas.  Seems to be a few lakes around with 4"" on them already... but the snow today and yesterday sure won't help make it safe."
821013,muskymatt,2013-11-29 00:14:00,2608,"I think it was about 4-5 years ago my bud and I were fishing walleye January 7th from a boat. Strange, kinda neat but would rather have been on the ice."
821016,Moosebunk,2013-11-29 00:34:00,3970, Your socks dry yet????   Too perfectly witty!  Bring on a day of icing pannies to thicken the blood... then let the real blood bath begin.
821053,danc,2013-11-29 02:28:00,4677,You mean to tell me that there's lakes with no ice yet?
821059,Acountdeleted,2013-11-29 02:47:00,2562,"Well, the girlfriend isn't going to be happy, but looks like I'm going to be able to do a lot of ice fishing over the Christmas break."
821086,shimano19,2013-11-29 04:12:00,196,Lets hope this cold weather continues. Early season!
821099,mike rousseau,2013-11-29 07:31:00,4661, We are super lucky here... There are spots that'll be frozen enough you could ice fish this weekend... Yet I'll be out in the boat.... We have no break between ice up and boat season... Spring or fall...  Most years I'm able toget out past New Years...
821101,fishindevil,2013-11-29 08:41:00,6254,Well most of sturgeon lake in the kawarthas froze over now !!!! I knew as soon as the wind died down it would freeze and it's -15 here now in bobcaygeon with no wind so it should be real tight soon !!!!! Awesome ......
821102,lew,2013-11-29 09:44:00,12766,"Same for Clear Lake east of you Shawn, it was wide open Wednesday and frozen right across last night.  Kinda pretty right now too with the crescent moon shining on the ice."
