820743,dave524,2013-11-27 14:21:00,4508,I don't ever recall the name PrinceCraft until maybe the late 70's but lots of Red Springbok and blue-green Mirrocraft tinners back then. I thought somehow Springbok morphed into the Princecraft label.

I thought somehow Springbok morphed into the Princecraft label.  Yes, it did.  I think it was when Al-Can sold it to OMC.  I think Princecraft was a separate company at one time... Princecraft and Springbok may been merged into one."

820343,RJackson,2013-11-26 02:55:00,113,Bizarre that you just posted this.  In light of recent events I spoke to my buddy who runs the local Lund dealer.  He directed me to this video.  RJ
820344,nancur373,2013-11-26 02:58:00,1211,cool. something to strongly consider when purchasing.
820345,Steve,2013-11-26 02:58:00,2075,"Folks will ask why do Lunds cost more?  Other uneducated folks will say that Lund just charges more because of their ""name"".  There is a reason that everyone compares their boat to a Lund."
820346,leaf4,2013-11-26 02:59:00,2466,"haha wow, is this a 5 year old video? I noticed the 60th anniversary which was 08"
820350,irishfield,2013-11-26 03:04:00,26272,"All boats sold in Canada with a Transport Canada placard on them are supposed to pass a level floatation test. When fully loaded to capacity... fuel tank full.. all standard and optional equipment in place and the motor(s) installed. Boat is to be fully swamped and left in the water for OVER 18 hours to release any trapped air in the hull, and the boat must float within 10 degrees of level and no part of the boat can be more than 6"" below the water when it does."
820357,BillM,2013-11-26 03:13:00,17367,Is this a 80's Ranger commercial re-born?
820358,OhioFisherman,2013-11-26 03:19:00,6623,Seems like a waste of a nice boat.
820365,irishfield,2013-11-26 03:30:00,26272,"Here's another of the same boat.. posted a year ago.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jrspiVxxkI&feature=share  You should be able to do this to ANY boat sold in Canada since before 2004. The requirement is the same for every pleasure craft manufacture in order to meet TC standards, so I didn't post it for ""mine's better than yours"". Just to show the hull is only there now for speed and to keep you dry."

820373,Moosebunk,2013-11-26 04:29:00,3970,You'd pretty well have to drill a hole in a Lund to make it leak.
820381,fishindevil,2013-11-26 08:31:00,6254,Us Lund owners have known for along time why a Lund is just a better built boat !!!! Lol ....
820382,fishindevil,2013-11-26 08:35:00,6254,Thanks for sharing cool vid !!!

820471,Ralph Field,2013-11-26 18:04:00,1018,It was a 61 and sank at the dock when it filled with water during a torado that blew through the Huntsville area while we were staying in the area.

I would imagine that things have come a long way since then, at least I hope so, I have a 2008 PrinceCraft (which I haven't tried to sink yet and don't intend to) and I would like to think that if I ever did miscue and fill it with water I would have a fighting chance. That 60 hp 4 stroke on the back sure does weigh a lot though and I would think it would take a lot of foam to keep it afloat."

Going back to the 60's weren't they Springboks instead of Princecrafts??? Lots of them red sided cartoppers with the antelope on the side back then.
820740,Ralph Field,2013-11-27 14:09:00,1018,"Mine had Prince Craft written on the sides at the back. The letters were actually gone , but you could easily read Princecraft on either side. Replaced almost all the rivets in the bottom over the years."
