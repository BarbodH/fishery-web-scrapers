816868,MJL,2013-11-05 12:17:00,2427,"Hey Edwin. I haven't forgot about swinging by to test drive one. I just haven't been able to make it to your neighbourhood yet. If all things are a go with my friend, I may pop into the shop this week for a look-see.  The reels look great"
816870,ChasinTails,2013-11-05 12:23:00,90,sorry if this is already asked but how much is the reel for it looks badass

Bill Thanks bud...I hear you guys got a trip lined up...I'm a bit jealous I must say   Thanks for the props guys. I appreciate it. However I think I'll be answering a few questions privately.  It's only fair and keeping to forum rules.
816909,Ron,2013-11-05 17:01:00,1683,"Very nice Edwin! Truly another piece of functional art. Pairing your skilled craft with Spiels fine workmanship would certainly be the envy of any angler on any of the tribs!  Cheers, Ron..."

816971,spinnerdoc,2013-11-05 21:16:00,556,Desmond didn't waste any time putting his to test. Glad you had a good trip bud.        
817181,RDR,2013-11-07 00:40:00,125,"Congrats on a job well done Edwin!  I've seen and held a couple of your creations over at Spiels. Haven't fished one yet, since I can't get him out of his basement"
817654,spinnerdoc,2013-11-09 22:23:00,556,Thanks RDR.  I heard you were successful getting SPIEL out of his basement

Spiel for letting me fit them on his array of reel seats and for some suggestions  To the local reel makers, Esp. Ron Gardiner and to Al Taylor, for their inspiring work  and support  Thanks for the kind words as well, guys.  I did try to incorporate people's wants and needs, hopefully I addressed most of it"
787950,solopaddler,2013-05-22 11:28:00,8605,Hey you finally chimed in!
787957,Harrison,2013-05-22 12:11:00,2202,Super slick!!!! Amazing work. I'm really impressed.
788147,spinnerdoc,2013-05-23 10:01:00,556,Glad you like them bud. My original plan for the 3 spokes were to have just one handle and 2 counter weights
788157,blaque,2013-05-23 12:13:00,2419," Love em'....Youve got a designers eye for sure, you can tell when someone just starts pokin holes in aluminum in a rythmic pattern vs. when someone puts detailed thought into every step of a reel design. Impressive"
788264,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-24 01:46:00,0,those are sexy!
788288,spinnerdoc,2013-05-24 09:50:00,556,You are so kind my friend. I wanted to offer something a fresh approach.
788289,spinnerdoc,2013-05-24 09:51:00,556,Hi doc haven't seen you around  here for a while and thanks for props
788310,Moosebunk,2013-05-24 12:59:00,3970,Blown away.  Works of art really.  Must be tough selling or giving away babies like those.  If I guess their names do I get the first born?  Going with... Razorback over Rumplestiltskin.  Did I win??? lol.  Nicely done...
788651,spinnerdoc,2013-05-27 09:48:00,556,"I went with something a little subtle. He's actually me second boy, and his name is Eliot. First one is Ethan.  Thanks for the kind words bud"
788707,Bill Shearer,2013-05-27 20:26:00,456,Very Nice original designs! Well done.
788709,Christopheraaron,2013-05-27 20:34:00,3525,They all look awesome! My favourite is definitely the matte silver
788815,spinnerdoc,2013-05-28 09:48:00,556,"Thanks Floatman55, I trid to be as original as I could  The matte silver ChrisK is supposed to be clear but due to the hard coat it takes that hue"
790030,Spiel,2013-06-02 21:25:00,9065,"Looks like I'll own two shortly, way happy!  Thanks Edwin.  Hope to see you as soon as you can escape work and fatherhood."
790325,spinnerdoc,2013-06-04 09:40:00,556,See you when I can bud
790338,Floren Lukatsky,2013-06-04 12:47:00,23,Very impressive when are you going into production and what are retails going to be set at?
816784,spinnerdoc,2013-11-04 21:22:00,556,"For the first time I have all 4 reels in one roof, but if only for a few hours.  I snapped a few pics with the new parts installed. ..could not resist and off it goes again.   This one I will miss...     I kept a few for the kids....and me . This one is mine.      PS: Thanks to the guys who stood by me."
816786,Terry,2013-11-04 21:24:00,14456,NICE  if only I was rich  lol
816787,Roy,2013-11-04 21:34:00,13728,"They're absolutely beautiful, Edwin. People will be wanting to touch and feel."
816790,solopaddler,2013-11-04 21:48:00,8605,"PS: Thanks to the guys who stood by me.   Without getting into details as it's just not worth it, Edwin was unfairly criticized on another board for supposedly copying someone elses design. An utterly ridiculous claim as is his reels are quite unique imo.  I'm happy to give Edwin my support, the man deserves it.  For those who are interested I've fished one of Edwin's reels since last spring and it's been flawless, just a joy to fish. Largest diameter reel I've ever fished yet also one of the lightest and smoothest.  The only thing that took some getting used to was the lack of a clicker mechanism. Edwin's reels have a simple locking mechanism that's engaged by turning a small knob on the back plate.  The only other reel I've ever seen that's even remotely similar are some of Al Taylors lovely heavily ported creations. Some of Al's reels also incorporate a locking mechanism.  Once again well done my friend!"
816796,leaf4,2013-11-04 22:11:00,2466,"Those are works of art, nice stuff!"
816803,davey buoy,2013-11-04 22:31:00,5505,Very nice reels!!!Great work!
816815,Jigger,2013-11-04 23:12:00,1237,"Ive never fished with a centerpin but those make me want to start. Very impressed, those are beauties!"
786964,solopaddler,2013-05-16 12:46:00,8605,"This post is a big shout out and pat on the back to a VERY talented fellow board member!  Back in mid April Edwin Aquino (spinnerdoc is his handle on the board), contacted me about a series of new float reels he was building. The idea was to get one of his reels into my hands so I could fish it and provide some feedback. The unfortunate part was I aquired the reel with very little time left in the spring season, however I did get to fish the reel several times and I'm honestly blown away!  He has made a total of 12 reels, and has decided to call them the ""Razorback"". There are 4 different porting patterns, 3 reels built for each pattern, so they're all quite unique and rare.  First off each reel is 51/4"" in diameter and each one is right around 8oz in weight.  They're heavily ported works of art with each back plate mirroring the front. There is no clicker on these reels, instead there's a tiny knob on the backplate that when turned locks the reel.  For those of you guys who are familiar with Al Taylors wonderful handmade creations, Edwin's reels are VERY similar. Al's reels are the only other ones I've ever seen made with a locking mechanism rather than a clicker.  He has two different finishes on these reels. Both of them are matte hardcoat finishes. One is flat black, the other can only be described as matte platinum. These reels have the most flawless finish I've ever seen on a float reel. That is a direct result of the hours Edwin spent buffing and polishing each reel before they were sent off for annodizing.  The tolerances on these reels are also incredibly fine, it's obvious that an enormous amount of precision went into their construction.  As you'll also see in the pic's each reel foot is one piece, fully integrated into the backplate. There are no screws.  He put abec 7 bearings in them, and at least the one I have spins like a dream.  All in all I couldn't be more impressed. The 51/4"" diameter is great to fish and reel is just so featherlight it's incredible.  About the ONLY thing I can complain about is the handles. They're kind of thick and chunky. I much prefer something slimmer and more tapered. That however is a minor point as handles can be changed.   I know Edwin will be selling these reels, but I'll let him handle that. Price wise they'll be in the same range as a Milner or Angspec (I'm sure he can confirm that) and worth every single penny imo.  He's in the process of getting boxes made for the reels as well as neoprene pouches and will be ready very soon.  I know he's been preoccupied with other more important things as he and his wife had a new baby boy arrive last week (congrat's again bud!)   With that said, here's some pic's of two of his creations. I'm currently fishing the black two handled reel:                Also for those that are interested here's a link to Edwin's photobucket album showing the other porting patterns he's created:  http://s1088.photobucket.com/user/spinnerdoc/library/RAZORBACK%20Series?sort=6&page=1#/user/spinnerdoc/library/RAZORBACK%20Series?sort=6&page=1&_suid=136870489595305273469894447952    Well done my friend!   Cheers   "
786966,Roy,2013-05-16 12:54:00,13728,WOW!
786967,mike rousseau,2013-05-16 12:55:00,4661,The black one reminds me of the gears of a clock or something...  Very cool reels...
786971,BillM,2013-05-16 13:12:00,17367,Love the matte finishes to both those reels.  How's the handle spacing?
786972,MJL,2013-05-16 13:12:00,2427,Beautiful reels Edwin
786973,Ralph Field,2013-05-16 13:14:00,1018,It is easy to see that a lot of work went into making these reels.
786993,solopaddler,2013-05-16 14:21:00,8605," It's totally fine, same spacing that's on my DeMarco. Only issue is with the handles themselves and Edwin will fix that."
787006,bobogo,2013-05-16 15:26:00,76,those look awesome. It'll forsure get a lot of stares at the river.
787008,lew,2013-05-16 15:28:00,12766,"Never used that type of reel Mike, or even held one in my hand for that matter, but it doesn't take a trained eye to know that's definitely a quality product, infact darned near a piece of art.  Beautiful work for sure spinnerdoc !!"
787011,misfish,2013-05-16 15:34:00,29133,I WANT ONE Awesome workmanship.
787076,esoxansteel,2013-05-16 20:44:00,1307,"Nice looking CP's, and very uniquely ported as well, seems to be some interest in millrights turning out great pins and flyreels of late, match it up with a Speil creation, and your all set for the October rains"
787094,Spiel,2013-05-16 21:05:00,9065,I held the protos pre assembly and anodizing.  All I can say is I want one. Nice work Spinnerdoc!
787096,lew,2013-05-16 21:09:00,12766, I sense a deal in the works Chris LOL
787097,RJackson,2013-05-16 21:10:00,113,Some incredible craftsmanship there!  RJ
787098,Spiel,2013-05-16 21:13:00,9065," I'd like to play that card Lew, we'll see how it plays out."
787106,davey buoy,2013-05-16 22:04:00,5505,He built those reels to a whole new level. I'd love one of those as well!! Nicely done!
787115,Locnar,2013-05-16 23:44:00,645,"So... newbie question here... What are the differences between float reels and fly reels? And with float fishing, do you line it with regular fishing line or fly line?"
787150,Bondar,2013-05-17 04:56:00,817,"sign me up for a black 2 handle version  , awesome work"
787156,solopaddler,2013-05-17 09:55:00,8605," Anybody who's interested in a reel can likely pm spinnerdoc for details.  Also Jeff, you're welcome to check out the reel I have in my possession. That goes for anyone else who lives in the Hamilton area too.  Cheers"
787188,cuzza,2013-05-17 14:20:00,467," Float reel - free spooling, designed to pay out line at the pace of the current to give a drag free drift, normally larger diameter than an average freshwater fly reel, narrower and shallower spool. No drag (on most) and just has a clicker to stop it free spooling line all over the place when moving around with a  rigged up rod. Designed to carry about 200yds of 8lb mono.  Fly reel - no free spool, has a permamnent check mechanism to stop line coming off the spool unless it's pulled by the angler, deeper, wider spool to carry a thick fly line (~90ft long) plus 50-200yds of dacron backing. Many have a adjustable drag especially in larger sizes.  Example - float reel on left, fly reel on right, it doesn't look it but the fly reel sppol is quite a bit wider......    Mike, those reels looks great, fantastic pieces of engineering - great job spinnerdoc!"
787202,ironstone74,2013-05-17 15:42:00,201,"Wow, great looking reels!  I'd love to get a look at one in person.  Are all 12 spoken for?  Paul"
787230,blaque,2013-05-17 20:24:00,2419,"That black matte design is purdy!  The three handle i might say to just make it a one handle, ya can only use one at a time anyway lol (not sure how that would effect the balance of the reel when peeling line in a slow drift)"
787238,misfish,2013-05-17 21:30:00,29133," I hope not. Im waiting for a reply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
787242,solopaddler,2013-05-17 21:43:00,8605," No worries Paul I don't think any have been spoken for, beyond the one I'm fishing. I'm in Hamilton if you want to check out mine, Edwin is in Mississauga.  Cheers   Edwin warned me he might not answer pm's or emails right away. Him and his wife just had a new baby boy so they're preoccupied.  All in due time my friend."
787244,misfish,2013-05-17 22:14:00,29133,"Yup I seen that Mike. Family first. No worries.  Worth the drive to Miss,to see in person."
