821634,GBW,2013-12-01 19:59:00,8460,"Well, I took off the cover and all the lines on mine look fine.  re-cleaned and tested the plug and it's fine.  must be a carb. thing and that's not something I'm willing to tinker with...  D'OH!"
821648,GBW,2013-12-01 20:56:00,8460,"WOOHOO, I got it running!  I found a tiny gas leak and fixed it up and now running just fine."

820503,lew,2013-11-26 20:07:00,12766,"I put the winter tires & wheels on the truck this morning then decided I may as well get the snow blower outta the shed after sitting for 7 or 8 months  and make sure it's good for the upcoming winter season.  Filled er up with fresh stabilized gas,  pulled on the choke, couple primes and pulled the starter cord and the old girl fired right up on the very 1st pull and right away was purring like a kitten just as it does every year.  Always good to take the extra time and do things right when your storing stuff away for a long period of time.  Now I'm ready for the winter"
820506,Tdel,2013-11-26 20:13:00,393,"Lew, I got mine up and running this morning too. Now it can stop snowing because I am ready for it."
820510,bigbuck,2013-11-26 20:52:00,2449,"I fueled mine up and gave it 3-4 slow pulls to move the oil around, turned the ignition on, primed and choke on and she started on the first pull. So, according to my snowblower, it wont be a bad winter. When it gives me issues, its a bad winter. Shes 23 years old and hasnt been wrong."
820512,Roy,2013-11-26 20:57:00,13728,"Watching the snow heading this way the last couple of days, I started mine yesterday morning. First turn as well. I'm a happy camper."

820528,davey buoy,2013-11-26 22:04:00,5505,"My 12 year old Murry Select 1027,changed the oil,always treat the gas in the fall,started first pull as well like every year.Really like the Sno King engines.Funny thing,the starter stopped working in the third year.Maybe I'll take it apart soon and see what's wrong.But one pull starting,there was never a urgency ."

820539,bigugli,2013-11-26 22:52:00,6138,Snow used to mean 6-8 hours of heavy exercise. No snow chores for me any more. It's one small blessing of apartment life. S
