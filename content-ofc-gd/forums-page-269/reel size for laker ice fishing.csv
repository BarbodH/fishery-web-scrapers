820376,redpearl99,2013-11-26 05:17:00,259,"I've decided I want to give lake trout fishing a try this winter, so I need to get a reel for deep water lakers.  I was thinking of getting either the Shimano Sienna 1000RD or the 500FD.   Leaning towards the 1000FD.  I'm assuming I would need at least a 1000 size spool.  But kind of line should I also be getting?  braid or 8lb mono?  Thanks"
820386,ckrb2007,2013-11-26 11:34:00,449,I've always used the 2500 size spooled with 15lb braid with an  8lb flouro leader.
820402,BillM,2013-11-26 13:22:00,17367,"I used 1000 sized reels, haven't been spooled yet.   My buddy Dave was spooled using a 500 series I think two years ago, lol!"
820404,Cosmos,2013-11-26 13:24:00,588,"I was using 500 size with 10 lb ice braid(whole spool of 50 yards) and 10 feet 10 lb fluoro leader all last winter. Landed a lot of fish and never had any issues or being spooled out. I prefer to use my baitcaster reel with st Croix rod for lakers, which is spooled with 10 lb ice braid(whole spool of 50 yards) and 10 feet 10 lb fluoro leader."
820445,Jds63,2013-11-26 16:35:00,1365,"  same here, but I will be trying out a baitcaster this winter as well"
820682,redpearl99,2013-11-27 02:15:00,259,"hmmm, interesing..... I would have figured a 500 series reel would get spooled very easily but it doesnt seem like it does.  do you think 50 yards of braid + 10 yards of leader is enough for simcoe lakers??"
820690,BillM,2013-11-27 02:49:00,17367,Go with a 1000 series at a minimum.  Sedona/Sahara would be a good choice.
820730,davey buoy,2013-11-27 09:08:00,5505,Last year I started using a 2500 series reel.The line capacity and line pick up speed is a real bonus.
820735,wallacio,2013-11-27 12:42:00,475,"I used 1000 sized reels, haven't been spooled yet.   My buddy Dave was spooled using a 500 series I think two years ago, lol!  Thanks for bringing that up!  LOL   Yeah, a good sized Simcoe fish spooled me with a 500 reel...ran straight to bottom then kept on going horizontally along bottom like a freight train and SNAP!   As others have said, 1000 minimum but if you are going to encounter big fish in deep water then a 2500 is a better choice."
820739,steverowbotham,2013-11-27 14:08:00,1800,I vary between 1000 and 2500. 2500 comes in handy when you're into bigger fish!
820797,Fisherpete,2013-11-27 20:11:00,1814,2500 for me
820803,redpearl99,2013-11-27 20:50:00,259,has anyone actually been spooled on a 1000 series or do you just prefer the extra line pickup of the 2500?  I'm just thinking the 2500 might be a bit too heavy compared to the rod
820812,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-27 22:15:00,10439,I run 1000 and 2500 series spinning reels and 5500 or 6500 series ABU baitcasters with 15#-30# braid plus a flouro leader.
