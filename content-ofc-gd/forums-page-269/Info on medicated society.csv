820889,Rich,2013-11-28 11:16:00,3927,It's a wonder how there's any water left in there.

820897,fishindevil,2013-11-28 12:53:00,6254,"its sad,and has been going on for some time too,and canadian waters are not any different ,these are showing up in our great lakes drinking water as well....its pretty gross....sad but a new fact thats for sure...its not going to get qany better they are also finding birth control hormones in fish too,as well as anti-inflamatories as they take quite a while to break down.....and to think it used to be just DDT,and mercury and dioxin and PCB THAT THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT !!!!!"

820901,Marc Thorpe,2013-11-28 13:01:00,621,"Thing about it is our waste water management throughout North Amercia has not evolved to this sort of new polutants.We dampened chemical waste but did not anticipate pharmaceutical. Only way to counter this form of waste management is Ozone treatment of waste water,every major city throught North Amercia needs to implement such systems.  We know more than we did in the past but far less than the futur"

This past year, our local papermill(towns main industry/source of employment) shut its doors. This past summer i seen the river thrive with walleye populations that normally migrated, and..... Crappie!!!!  Could be a mere coincidence but its made me think"

Under the new Fisheries Act, it is quite possible and lawful for vast tracts of the great white north to be turned into hazardous waste zones. Waters not habited or used by humans won't require environmental protection."
820925,manitoubass2,2013-11-28 14:47:00,11391,This is one of the last protected watersheds. Hope its actually protected and last for many more lifetimes then i
820970,Rich,2013-11-28 20:26:00,3927,"Wastewater is kind of a joke that we all ignore.  Most treatment facilities go through a 'purge' once a month or so.  Essentially this means they have too much waste to deal with, so they take the least toxic of the wastewater, triple the chlorine and shoot it directly back into the watershed. Terrible!! And ROUTINE!!"
821021,sofabed,2013-11-29 00:51:00,119,I am not sure where you are getting your info on waste water plants but yes they do overflow caused by unexpected water flows. The treatment used in theses cases is tertiary treatment which is using chlorine. How ever the chlorine is removed before it is sent to the water shed.  Another form of treatment to remove the pharmaceuticals in a water system is using an AOP using  a high intensity UV system. This is a very new form of treatment in water supplies .
821023,Steve,2013-11-29 00:55:00,2075,"what is the treatment to remove the pharmaceuticals in hamilton harbour.  oh that's right, none.  nothing beats launches full of tampon applicators and constant stories of estrogen filled fish from the harbour.  and the water flows that cause the overflows are far from unexpected. they just look at it as a justified ends to the means.  its cheaper to let the poop flow than to fix it."
821271,Rich,2013-11-30 10:20:00,3927,"Same place as you? You just re-worded what I said so it sounded PC.  Except that ""unexpected"" part. They full well know it's coming.  Please explain how they remove chlorine from water without distillation?"

821286,aplumma,2013-11-30 14:28:00,6896,Rich Chlorine is actually easy to remove it is volatile and actually removes itself when exposed to atmospheric pressure. It can be accelerated by exposure to sunlight band spectrum. The combination that a lot of places use is  chloramine which is a chlorine and ammonia based product that resists flashing and is less expensive to use. Both compounds are easily removed using a carbon based filtration system but since the carbon absorbs the products and does not change it you then have a carbon contaminated with the products you removed from the water.

821291,Rich,2013-11-30 15:26:00,3927,Thanks for the info. I dont know why I didnt put that together. We 'air filter' the chlorine out of our tapwater before we refridgerate it.. shoulda figured that out. Lol
821295,manitoubass2,2013-11-30 16:05:00,11391,I just cleaned out a cone at our water plant last week or so. Pretty gross stuff. Our plant draws well water though not from the river like other nearbye towns. Lots of nasty lime to clean out.
