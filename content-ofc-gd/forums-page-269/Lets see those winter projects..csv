820331,GBW,2013-11-26 02:13:00,8460,Is there anyone in the Lindsay area that knows about HVAC that can help with a Q?  I want to move that area where the 'bulkhead' was so the new enclosed area doesn't need to be as crazy wide.  Seeing as what you can see from the pic's there is only 4 lines/vents it's pushing heat/cold to; how much can I move that wide body part with an angel unit?  by angle unit I mean take the direct force of the primary and 'bend' it.  does that sound right?  LOL  Thanks. Geoff

821105,DanD,2013-11-29 11:41:00,2223,"I'm so far behind and have so many pokers in the fire.. I'm not really sure what my true winter project is. There are many...  I know what you mean; besides my day to day customers, I've just taken on a 1964 Impala. Guy wants me to install a LS1, 5.7Lt and a 4L60E, 4 speed automatic; this drive train was salvaged from a 2004 Camaro Z28 wreck. That means fabricating engine and trans mounts, rewiring the car to accept the computer controls and the rest of the electronics that go with. Meanwhile my 50 Chev gets to be pushed to the side; but she'll understand. The money made from the Impala will be invested in the Styleline; that's if the wife/book keeper  doesn't get her hands on the cash first. LOL  Dan."

819206,NAW,2013-11-20 03:10:00,4022,I don't have any pics...  But I'll be revamping the lighting in my kitchen this winter.  Which will envolve tearing out a big chunk of my ceiling.  Not looking foward to it.  But the end result will be worth it!
819213,Twocoda,2013-11-20 03:45:00,4130,i guessing the Ford project is going to take a little longer than this winter...but its an awesome project...Im sure youll enjoy the whole process...are you going to sandblast the frame before you mount the cab?
819219,Freshtrax,2013-11-20 04:41:00,2215,"Lots left to do on the frame still.   The cab is bolted on there right now.   But when all fab work is done the whole car will be disassembled, dressed and painted."

The in-line 6 just didn't cut it; so last winter I swapped it out for a V8 Vortec 4.8Lt, out of a 99 Silverado. Sure did wake up the old girl going from 92hp to an approx 285hp, fuel injected computer controlled. This winter I'm planing on a disk brake conversion for the front and possibly adding air conditioning. Once I get as far as I want on the mechanical; I'll start on the cosmetics.   Dan  "

Next is to fix up a vehicle for my daughter, a couple to choose from, depending on what she wants. Then it's going to be something I want to play with, a 1950 Farmall  Super ""A"".This project had a little bit of a headstart last winter. Repaired and painted the fuel tank, straighted out a lot of dents in the grill and engine cover, removed rust and painted a few sections. Still a long way to go. Found an original type decal set too.Dunno why I am doing this, really don't need a tractor. But it's been in the family longr than I have been around.Still runs great.  "
819306,misfish,2013-11-20 22:10:00,29133, Thats a project and a half Andrew.  I have the first bung made for the wishbone.Was just making the final cut on the second and the cutter exploded. Damaged goods.   Hope to have the second done by friday bud.
819313,GBW,2013-11-20 23:01:00,8460,"Me, a new to me house in Lindsay.  I have already pulled the ceiling down and the bulkhead in one room of the basement.  It's going from 40 year old looking room to a... duno yet.  HA.  Its a big room but it's more for the kids to play in and do whatever rather then get the rest of the house a mess.  I may even set up my son's race track in there and all my old sports stuff."
819320,Handlebarz,2013-11-20 23:31:00,3790,Dang you all are ambitious I do admire the hard work that goes into the old cars.  As for me my winter project is building lures I am happy with this project.

819353,Freshtrax,2013-11-21 04:02:00,2215,"No hurry man , when there done there done. I really appreciate you making them for me.  Bernie I love that old tractor.   We have a 40' s massy Harris that I only use to spread manure once a year.   ( big tractor would be way too much power for my old crap chucker)  and the thing always fires right up.  It amazes me every time."
820264,GBW,2013-11-25 23:02:00,8460,So here is what I have started in 1/2 the basement. The big half that is the 'games room' I pulled the ceiling and going to pull the wood on the drywall walls.185607_zps09dfcc5c.jpg.html] [/url] 
820267,DRIFTER_016,2013-11-25 23:11:00,10439,And here is my latest winter project.      I'm also going to be working on my cabin lot removing trees and cutting trail as well as putting my dock together. Started on the dock part on Saturday by removing a one year old 14'X16' pressure treated deck from a house that is slated to be knocked down shortly. Spent 5 hours dismantling and hauling it home. Will wait for late winter to assemble and haul to the site just before ice out.  Got to like free stuff (too bad the floats and hardware won't be).    When the go ahead is given to knock the house down I have access to the rear door (a new steel insulated one) and the electrical panel as well as some other goodies. It will be nice to have a good door with no $$$ spent.
820273,Bernie,2013-11-25 23:16:00,3190,"Yesterdays project.  A fellow dropped this old saw off on Friday. He found it in the dump. Thought I could use it for parts for my other one. I cleaned it up, fixed the rewind. It had compression and spark so I continued to clean the carb, adjust the linkage, fuel tank and spark plug. It fired right up and ran great Looked like this after.   So happy I cleaned it up some more.    "
820321,Nipfisher,2013-11-26 01:11:00,2449,Just picked up a 1988 Ski Doo Citation to restore.  I sold my 1993 Ski-doo Skandic II 503R last week and replaced it with a 1988 Ski-doo Tundra LT 250cc. I am looking forward to breaking some trails into back lakes this winter.
