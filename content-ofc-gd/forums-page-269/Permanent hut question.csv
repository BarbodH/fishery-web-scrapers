But does it fall into the tent category with the two plywood ends. Maybe I'll just register it anyway. I plan to fold it down when not in use and have a few poles or such standing around it with reflective tape.

821306,davey buoy,2013-11-30 16:48:00,5505,"If it stays overnight,I believe so.Being under the alloted sq ft,as a portable your fine.Registering is free,and the numbers they give you have to be displayed on the hut in clear view."

821332,Freshtrax,2013-11-30 17:53:00,2215,I have to agree.   Would be impossible to spot at night folded down in a snowstorm.
