Anybody shoot thru the hull on a fiberglass bass boat?   Humminbird 8series or lowrance elite 7 is what I'm looking into......   Currently I shoot thru hull with my transducers.  I'm uncertain with mounting options on my fiberglass....
820832,miller,2013-11-28 01:22:00,223,If you plan on mounting it on your transom do yourself a favor and buy a transducer mounting board. Drill the 2 holes to mount that and for any transducers in the future you have a composite board you're screwing into rather than more holes in your boat.

Better than all my lowrance units. Even better then the touch. Ive got it up front right now as a dedicated DS unit."
