820928,aplumma,2013-11-28 14:57:00,6896,It is a day of family and friends with a good dash of food added in. It also is a day to give thanks for all of the people who have entered our lives and enriched them. I am very happy to say I have thousands of friends that I am thankful for. Some I will never meet in person but will have been enriched by their knowledge and kindness over the internet.  Thank you to all who read this and best wishes to all.   Art
