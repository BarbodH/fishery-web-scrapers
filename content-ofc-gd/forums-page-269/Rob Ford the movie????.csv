819446,redpearl99,2013-11-22 00:55:00,259,I would go watch it  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUY6lDja-DE
819450,Locnar,2013-11-22 01:04:00,645,"Say what you want, I actually like Rob Ford. No other mayor has saved Toronto as much money as he has. I also enjoy his little public freak outs... it shows that he's human and not some emotionless, robotic monster."
819451,tb4me,2013-11-22 01:07:00,3295,Rob Ford for PMO...lol All kidding aside that video made me realize how much i actually missed Chris Farley..Man its almost like Ford life was scripted just so this video could be made.. From the running over the lady the camera crash to the football wipe-out..Incredible..Also very well done
819454,Rod Caster,2013-11-22 01:14:00,5784,That was funny
819456,Richie Razor,2013-11-22 01:17:00,536,LOL THAT WOULD BE AMAZING !!!!
819458,SirCranksalot,2013-11-22 01:18:00,3291,"No other mayor has saved Toronto as much money as he has.  not true, but it's what Ford would like you to believe."
819459,tb4me,2013-11-22 01:19:00,3295,"not true, but it's what Ford would like you to believe. This depends on what side of the coin you look at.."
819524,limeyangler,2013-11-22 09:11:00,5204,not again!
819552,kickingfrog,2013-11-22 14:37:00,8333,How many movies does this make for the Jackass franchise?
819652,misfish,2013-11-22 21:53:00,29133,"Cant believe Im going to say this but,if Rob watched this,he might get an awakening.  As much of a dumb    he has been,theres always something that makes you click and say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Time to change.  Then again,it might be too late. Politics anyways.   Farley. rocks. Well,he did."
819657,SirCranksalot,2013-11-22 22:03:00,3291,This depends on what side of the coin you look at..  Or which side of the bookstore---fiction or non-fiction!
820313,pidge,2013-11-26 00:54:00,438,Straight to DVD. Lol
820314,hotsky,2013-11-26 00:55:00,400,Exactly how I feel. He's not fake like 99% of poloticians.
820316,tb4me,2013-11-26 01:00:00,3295,See they stripped him of his budget duties and council is already talking a much larger increase.. All of 4 or 5 days tops..Gravy train is back on! Wait till they all give themselves a nice cushy raise...
820320,kickingfrog,2013-11-26 01:10:00,8333,Didn't T.O. raise taxes by the same 2.5% last year?
820322,woodenboater,2013-11-26 01:14:00,2277,"He's fake in that he tries to come off as a 99%er but he's not. Daddy was an MP in Harris' gubmint and he was born into money. Globe and Mail broke down his financials and it's good reading.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/assessing-the-financial-affairs-of-average-guy-mayor-rob-ford/article15574327/#dashboard/follows/  as well, the numbers he spouts as savings ($1 billion) has been broken down as well. I prefer facts > fiction ymmv"
820323,woodenboater,2013-11-26 01:16:00,2277,"some of the difference in tax increases can be directly attributed to the 2/3 stop scarborough subway proposal. we're paying more for a few stops, not very good use of funds imo. ymmv and I live in yyz so I have to deal with what happens at 100 queen st west."
820354,Steve,2013-11-26 03:10:00,2075,"we insure his labeling company.  can't tell you what their revenue is, but its a lot larger than you think!"
820362,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-26 03:26:00,4399,Another Ford secret out in the open....they are wealthy!
820395,Gerry,2013-11-26 12:58:00,257,They should make a new movie about the Ford brothers and name it Dumb and Dumber. Oh wait.....that's already been done....sorry.
820712,gogu392,2013-11-27 04:08:00,142,"Rob Ford does not make the games of smart guys who want to milk more taxes from the citizens, therefore it has to be trashed in the media. TV media in all countries are controlled and manipulated by strong financial interests. I don't want a mayor that speak nice and increase my taxes every year. I want a guy that deliver result with the same budget (that's performance). I will vote for him as long he will candidate."
820745,ehg,2013-11-27 14:35:00,2666," I will vote for him as long he will candidate. Give your head a shake. Lots of other fiscal conservatives will run.   Ya, an admitted crack smoking, drunk driving, very wealthy family guy who lies constantly would be perfect mayor again.  Now he is entertaining being in a porn movie. lol http://www.tmz.com/2013/11/26/toronto-mayor-tom-ford-sex-video-vivid-brandy-aniston/  Now that's entertainment.....ugh."
820746,BillM,2013-11-27 14:42:00,17367,"Toronto has had worse mayors then Ford, you couldn't use both hands to count them all."
820770,woodenboater,2013-11-27 17:52:00,2277,Lastman > Ford
