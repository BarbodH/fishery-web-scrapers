It is a slippery slope to poaching town.  (It had a cough, wasn't gonna make it.  Had to do it.)  It is also worth noting that nothing is wasted in Nature and Nature can be incredibly cruel when viewed through our prism.  I doubt the animals and organisms that would be sustained by roadkill would see it as cruel.  Cheers, Mark"

If the man charged thought like the legal system that charged him he could claim the rock was owned by the government, and since they made no apparent attempt to stop his actions, the government is an accomplice in facilitating the 2nd degree murder of a presumed innocent bear.

The bear would have died a slow and agonizing death waiting for someone to come shoot it, possibly started doing the ""funky chicken"" which could have startled an unsuspecting motorist causing an accident, or injured some moron who got too close to it for a photo to post on facebook.

You need help figuring that out?     Wow.  We're not talking about hunting where hunters attempt to kill an animal in the quickest way possible. This is a completely unforeseen event and the result was a wounded bear that was clearly suffering and the man used the tools available to end it's suffering as fast as possible. What is the difference in this situation? The difference is with the rock it was over in seconds and waiting for someone with a gun would have resulted in a much, much longer period of suffering for the animal. To be clear, the only time I support bludgeoning an animal to death is if it was previously mortally wounded.   IMO...you're suggestion of using a knife to finish the bear would have likely resulted in even more backlash.   -the bear was going to die -the man ended it's suffering quickly -nobody was hurt -it didn't cost taxpayers anything -the man scored some meat  What's the issue?"

This is what happens when bleeding hearts witness something unpleasant and feel that their emotions are more important than ending the suffering of an animal. How on earth would letting the animal continue to suffer until OPP or animal control showed up be better for the animal? Apparently an animal should be allowed to suffer to prevent anybodies feelings from being hurt?  ""Causing distress to an animal""? Unless he intentionally hit the bear with his vehicle, how could ending it's suffering be considered ""causing distress'? Why is it that the MNR found zero reason to charge the man yet the OSPCA thought otherwise? Public pressure from animal rights activists to lay charges?

When the cop fimally arrived, he was too afraid to shoot it, so I ended up using my sledge. I was livid with this cop.  Another time, a guy at work hit a deer on his way in, just around the corner. He called the cops, I went to track the wounded deer. There was snow on the ground, so tracking was easy....found it about 100yds off the road, still trying to run with no rear legs working. The cop shows up, so I ask him if he will put it down, he agrees that's the best thing to do, and opens fire....5 shots later he still hasn't touched the deer. Pathetic.  I'll bet this guy gets off scott free. The only reason he has been charged is to settle down the bleeding hearts that are making a fuss over nothing! Don't these people have anything else to do??  I'll also bet we don't hear a thing in the media about what happens. This province is really starting to drive me nuts!! Nothing but a bunch of bleeding heart sissies.
