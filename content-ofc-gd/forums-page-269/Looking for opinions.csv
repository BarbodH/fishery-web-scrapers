Kinda disappointing for both of us because I'd been saving up for the last month and my dad had been doing the same. Now that it's in the open we're just going to get it before the date since it's very likely I'll have been out a few times by then.  The unit that my dad was gong to go with was the FLX-28 (vex), I was looking at used units so I hadn't been doing a lot of researching but now that I have I'm considering the lx5 (marcum). What's everyone's opinions on these machines? they'll be used for all situations (perch to Simcoe lakers) so I like the dual beam feature but both of them have that, is the triducer really necessary? Low light option is interesting too but not really something that would sway my decision. I'm not really interested in graphs or dual purpose units, the ""you can even use it in the summer argument"" is really irrelevant since the only time I currently use my fishfinder is jigging which I can do with a flasher. I'm open to other flasher suggestions as well,but these are the ones I like most so far."

There all the same units except the 6 is a bit small (still big) the 7 is a bit bigger and the 9 has the same screen size as the 7 just come with an underwater camera that you can remove to make it lighter. My buddy has the lx9 and its a flasher, showdown, and a sonar all in one, he used the fl18 and says the response time is faster on the marcum lx9, the lx6 is cheaper than the fl28 and a lot better and more versatile IMO"
