820519,Terry,2013-11-26 21:16:00,14456,yeah I was happy staying in Robs bungalows
820529,Richie Razor,2013-11-26 22:13:00,536,The Waltonian. Nuff said.
820530,Bernie,2013-11-26 22:28:00,3190,"Anglers Haven, Ice Bungalows both come to mind in the South Bay."
820537,Joeytier,2013-11-26 22:49:00,3990,"The Waltonian offers great huts in okay fishing areas but dont have bungalows.  They do however have awesome cabins and a great main lodge with awesome food and entertainment.  I would reccomend them for the overall experience, but for strictly fishing go with Hyatt!  Early season his hut locations produce great fishing and youll be well looked after."

820727,JorgeCarlos,2013-11-27 06:49:00,109,"thanks  everyone,  im  thinkin 2 weekend  in Jan."
820736,Richie Razor,2013-11-27 13:28:00,536," Last year I had a great time at the Waltonian, we caught a ton of walleyes.....  You must go early in the season though for the best fishing IMO.  The on ice bungalows aren't my thing, I'd like to have at least some home comforts (hot shower, double bed) when up there. Plus nothing bites throughout the nighttime on the Nip, except for disgusting mud puppies..... And while on land it can always hit up the Mosey on inn....."
820754,Tim Mills,2013-11-27 16:10:00,476,Shawn at    www.bearcreekcottages.com  Good Ice fishing and an excellent Musky Guide as well.
820759,Cosmos,2013-11-27 16:49:00,588,x2 on Bear Creek  Fished with them 3 seasons in a row. Last winter was our best fishing trip.
820762,Joeytier,2013-11-27 17:00:00,3990,If you plan on not travelling from the huts then yes.  Most operators will not move their shacks throughout the season and are in easier access areas.  Early January is pretty much great everywhere!!
820766,Fisherman,2013-11-27 17:10:00,7201,"X3 on Bear Creek cottages, Shawn and Terra are very good operators."
820796,jimmer,2013-11-27 20:07:00,2730,What do you catch at the Mosey?
820819,Bernie,2013-11-27 23:01:00,3190,What do you catch at the Mosey?  Crustaceans mostly.
820834,jbailey,2013-11-28 01:38:00,866,The mosey is rough haha    a hazmat suit wouldn't even save you in that place!
820837,Fisherman,2013-11-28 01:51:00,7201,Vous attraperez des morpions.
820846,irishfield,2013-11-28 02:41:00,26272, Crustaceans mostly. LOL..
821045,paulyboy83,2013-11-29 02:08:00,54,I'm pretty sure the Waltonian suffered some severe damage this summer in a big storm we had in Callander.  Stay away from the Mosey.  All you'll catch there is stuff you'll need to see a doctor about.
821084,David Chong,2013-11-29 04:07:00,836,You can't go wrong at Rob Hyatt's! Been there numerous times!
