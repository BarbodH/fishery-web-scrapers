In other news Rogers is going to air sat night games on city tv, omni tv, CBC and all rogers stations..Now we wait to see what the new channel packages are going to cost.. CBC has to remain true free to air and all Sat night Leaf games will remain on CBC."

I believe there will be some sort of Sportsnet hockey package be it regional or national and I bet it will cause your cable bill to increase.

820585,Bernie,2013-11-26 23:56:00,3190,I have not yet paid to watch a hockey game on TV and I will refuse to do so in the future.I can see the possibility of hockey becoming PPV.

I trust the CBC way more than I trust the majority of privately owned corporation. The CBC (as much as they are floaty and eye-rolling liberal sometimes) does good work. I find it disturbing how some of our Canadian traditions are being treated as 'expenses'.  TSN sure is hurting now; first Jay Onrait, now this! haha."

820649,manitoubass2,2013-11-27 00:55:00,11391,"Kypreos is such a blabbering hypocrite. He constantly spins his opinion to sound like a hockey god. One game he says ""x team needs to play the puck up the boards harder"". Then the next clip is of another team doing exactly that, and hes all "" see, they just play the puck too hard up the boards. They need to go up the middle to be succesful"". Drives me nuts"

No I don`t think it will go the pay per game route, but I believe there will be some sort of package put forth i.e the Canadian package for xxx amount of $$$$ per month...you`ll still get your HNIC broadcast and call me cynical but I believe if you want more you`ll be paying more. I have not yet seen a cable or satellite provider give their customers more for less quite the opposite in fact."
820758,Headhunter,2013-11-27 16:48:00,5703,"So, Rogers/Bell took over ownership of the Leafs and the first thing they did was fire Brian Burke... too rough around the edges and not the kind of personality they wanted in their fold. I simply can't see the folks at Rogers wanting to deal with Cherry when he has one of his ""tense moments"". Hockey over the air, for free IS our Canadian tradition. It just happens to be called Hockey Night in Canada. What about the folks who don't have cable/sat and rely on antennaes to watch the game. Oh, never mind, those folks aren't Rogers customers so who cares? And anyone who thinks that this won't affect the CBC, is dreaming. A huge portion of CBC's revenue stream comes from HNIC. Without that revenue, the only content that CBC will be able to afford will be ""Who's who in the Hinterland"". Yesterday's decision will have long standing effects on the way we watch TV, not just sports. HH"
820765,Bernie,2013-11-27 17:08:00,3190,"TV in Canada I believe is going to change drastically. Supposedly we will be able to pick only the channels we wish to watch.With all the channels that are available that are ""thrown in"" with the packages, I think that many will not get enough support to continue.I know that my satellite channels will get real thin after the change. Lots of junk my family or I never watch. This is what makes me think that a lot of channels may become PPV."

This is true most of these small channels if you will and their ""junk"" programming are included in packages they are forced on you and by the way you already pay a little extra each month to subsidize these channels, And if you want TSN you have to upgrade your pkg equaling more dollars and on and on it goes. I heard the pick your channel announcement too And the skeptic in me says the CRTC will not let these little ""cultural channels die"" and again the cable and satellite providers will fight tooth and nail to protect their revenue stream.  Can you remember the last time the government did something that improved your service and saved you money???????.........................me either!!!"
820792,Freshtrax,2013-11-27 19:50:00,2215,I worked on a pilot for one of the big two where you could pick your own channels in western ont.    problem right now is with the current crtc legislation you still ended up with a bunch of junk channels that the majority of the population dosent watch.
820820,tb4me,2013-11-27 23:04:00,3295,Good news mid week leaf games will remain on TSN due to the fact that they are half owners of the team..

820423,lhousesoccer,2013-11-26 14:58:00,442,"Thought this would be up by now, but I don't see it, so ..... just wondering what everyone thinks of this 12-year deal the NHL made with Rogers giving them exclusive rights to broadcast all Canadian NHL games?  CBC managed to get Saturday night ""Hockey Night in Canada"" games for the next 4 years, but nothing after that it seems.  To me, this is sad news, growing up with HNIC.  Big money, big business always wins.  Why do I hate Bettman so much?!?!  http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/cbc-partners-with-rogers-in-landmark-nhl-rights-deal-1.2440326"
820427,grizzlybri,2013-11-26 15:04:00,565,Here is a link to TSN cover of the story  www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=437549   In there coverage of it. It says CBC will continue to host Hockey Night in Canada. There story does not mention the time frame
820434,Raf,2013-11-26 15:33:00,3495,an Over the Air carrier absolutely MUST be the ones with rights to saturday's games in my opinion.  I understand CBC will still do it for the time being but going forward?? Roger's expects us to get cable just to watch hockey?
820436,lhousesoccer,2013-11-26 15:40:00,442,"The CBC website's story doesn't include a lot of the information I heard on CBC Radio this morning for some reason.  CBC will only get one game per week - Saturday night - for the next 4 years.  Rogers will have everything else, and after 4 years, they'll have Saturday night as well.  They also get exclusive rights to all facets of the broadcast, meaning that how you see and hear the game will be determined by Rogers.  In other words, camera angles, Colour Commentators, hosts .... it will all be Rogers, all the time, in 4 years time."
820456,Richie Razor,2013-11-26 17:22:00,536,"CBC surely dropped the ball on this. Once HNIC leaves, the station will be done as well. Good Riddance"

820481,lookinforwalleye,2013-11-26 18:53:00,4399,"because Bell, Roger`s evil twin brother will have to buy the right to broadcast NHL from Rogers  so I am guessing you`ll be looking at a new package of some sort to watch hockey.  They are spending 5.2 billion so I am guessing there is a strategy in place to rape their customers."
