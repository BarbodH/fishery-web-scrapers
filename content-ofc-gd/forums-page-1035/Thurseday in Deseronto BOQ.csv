It became really windy around noon. Around 4ish afternoon, I found the honey hole! caught 6 more walleye, had to cull the smaller fish, left myself 4 chunky eaters. There were also pike and OOS largie caught, but they were all released.  Wasn't even late/dark befor I was satisfied with my catch     I will be back on Monday again!"
