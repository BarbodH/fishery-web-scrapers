198790,Clampet,2008-05-08 19:43:00,1947," Very true. That is how they will handle it. They will watch you like a hawk, and find anything at all, to justify getting rid of you.  It is a losing game.  You have to kiss a**, worship the boss, or you are certainly on your way out.  Very political.  Every man/woman for his/herself."
198817,Meely,2008-05-08 21:46:00,282,It's REAL simple..........  If it ain't yours to give away......dont give it away !  How would everyone feel if each Bank Teller gave away $.16 of your account balance every day? It's only $.16 right? Who's gonna mind ?  Meely
198818,keram,2008-05-08 21:52:00,585,"On related news:  TH shares plummeted Thursday to 25 years low ($ 0.15, just coincidence that it is a price of timbit) after TH coffee addict threatened to stop drinking watered down kind of coffee- like liquid, and start picketing “drive through” lines. To avoid total disaster TH headquarter, in desperation, promised to make coffee two, no three times stronger, and increase timbit size to match diameter of the softball. All North American media waiting for future development of this story. Canada’s national newspaper G&M  had to hire few more blog moderators to deal with overwhelming numbers of comments (close to 800 in few hrs ), and I have to tell you they were not pretty. CNN and Fox forgot about Hilary and Obama, They’ve send all their reporters to London, ON to cover this breaking story.  The only funny thing here is that this “orange” level warning was caused by 11 months old toddler and his silent accomplice, very well known   :devil:   to police as a Tim Bit   Lesson learned:  you fired - call the media, nothing to lose.  Apart from this, nothing interesting in the news  Oh, almost forgot, gas goes up 5 c on midnight, and death toll in Myanmar can reach 100000"
198864,Big Cliff,2008-05-08 23:24:00,6899,"Well, I figured this post would generate a lot of opinions and I'm glad it did. My thought is that any single mother of four who is willing to work for the wages she could get at a place like Tim Horton's instead of sitting on her butt and collecting welfare can't be all bad and to be fired for something as simple deserved a warning at worst!  I am very pleased to say that the response I got from my email to Tim Horton's did get answered and I was satisified with the reply and the outcome. hery is a copy of that email:  Dear Clifford Bignell:  I would like to thank you for taking the time to write to us at our Head Office.  At Tim Hortons we strive to offer all of our customers friendly and efficient customer service, high quality products in a clean and pleasant atmosphere.  In regards to the recent situation with the termination of a staff member in London, Ontario...  Unfortunately the action of the manager of this location was not appropriate, nor grounds for dismissal.  With an apology from management Ms. Lilliman has been rehired by the franchisee.  We sincerely apologize to our customers for this unfortunate incident.  Best Regards, Susan Operations Services THE TDL GROUP CORP. _____________________________________-  Did the publicity do it? I don't  know but I am pleased that if nothing else, she will be given another chance!"
198868,Photoz,2008-05-08 23:38:00,792,"Like a few people have commented . . . .     ""There's LIKELY 2 sides to this story"" . . .     but, it's just what the media pray for . . . .    a poor downtrodden single mother VS GOLIATH (big business) and right or wrong, big business doesn't stand a chance!! But . . . .    check back in a few weeks / months until this blows over and see if she's still working at Tim's? Publicly embarrass the boss? I don't like her chances of makin' retirement age, still at Timmies! Timmies must pay pretty good though . . . .    a single mom supporting a family of 4 on what Timmie's pays? Hm m m m  m??"
198882,Weeds,2008-05-09 00:02:00,782,"I'm thinking she gave away pretty much the only thing she could offer. A scrap of food basically. Had she worked as as a policeman (woman I guess) she could have given the kid a tour of the car, of if she was a fireman she could have shown off the firetruck, or station even. Had she been an office manager/secretary she could have let the kid play with a computer. Is it stealing still if all you give is your time? Even if that time technically belongs to someone else? See what I'm getting at? It's easy for guys with half decent jobs or middle/upper management positions  to draw the line at ""stealing is wrong"" but they can't begin to imagine how little influence/autonomy folks in these bottom tier positions have."
198926,danc,2008-05-09 01:13:00,4677,"To me it's just one more reason why I don't buy Tim Hortons, or any other franchise coffee. I make my own for pennies a cup. And I do this every day. I have a fancy coffee pot that makes the coffee before I wake.  Costs me pennies to make a pot. I have a cup or two before work, and then I fill my thermos and take it with me. I have coffee all day for next to nothing. There's been lots of talk about the price of gas lately. You Timmy guys are paying more for coffee than you are for gas.  Bottom line. I feel sorry for the girl that got fired, and I support her. It's just too bad that Timmys has multi millions of dollars to fight her case because people would rather pay the same for one cup at Timmy's rather than 30 cups at home. Personally, I don't understand it. But I feel for the girl."
198965,Pinch,2008-05-09 02:14:00,231," No I don't think that the publicity did do it,  I heard an interview with the employee and she said that she was offered a job last night at 6pm.  This story didn't really break until this morning."
198966,BillM,2008-05-09 02:17:00,17367, So I guess you don't have a comment about Tim Horton's giving away free Timbits to our canine friends eh?  I didn't think you would.
198998,marcers75,2008-05-09 03:11:00,36,"If you haven't heard, Tim Horton's head office gave her her job back at a different location. They reprimanded her former managers and called them overzealous.  However, she says she will still look for another job because she feels nobody's going to like her because of what happened."
199546,loner55,2008-05-10 14:09:00,4,"  Since it was well documented here and through the news that employees were permitted to hand out day old timbits to dogs, I didn't feel it was necessary to comment further.  Listen, I never said she should have been fired for a $0.16 timbit, what I was trying to get at is that when you own a business every penny adds up. Giving away something that can no longer be sold is a lot different from giving away something that can be.  To put it another way: if you went to the bait shop and an employee gave you a few extra shiners that were floating on the top, it would be different than giving you a few extra live ones that could/would have been purchased from someone else.  Tim Hortons will not give any details about this story so it's not easy to make a judgement when hearing only one side. Having worked in the hospitality profession as a manager I know that sometimes there is a need to get rid of an employee whether it be theft, attitude, or just plain work ethic. When you have clear evidence of a violation, no matter how trivial, you jump on the chance to fire the employee even though what you have as evidence is minor in comparison to what is not documented.  Now, let's go fishing!"
198767,blaque,2008-05-08 18:45:00,2419,"  $2336 a year is indeed chump change in proportion to the revenue/profits. And your equation is a little exaggeratory anyways......assuming may be a better word. I doubt 40 dogs and/or infants come thru any one timmies in a day, let alone every single day that year lol. Sorry, im saying this lightheartedly, not arguementatively. Welcome aboard by the way. It is funny that you walked in the door to hear a debate about whether an infant should get a free timbit or not in the drive thru at timmies  I agree though that ya cant boycott a corporation because an individual that represents you makes a mistake.  Timmies as a corporation should have an investigation on the individual that made this decision to fire someone however and make a public announcement so we all know the intricacies of the situation. Or not, it really doesnt bother me that much ......just bored at work hehe"
198768,Greencoachdog,2008-05-08 18:49:00,8163, Unless you're a minority...  I'd just like to say to everyone that has condemmed the actions by this facility... the next time your order is screwed up or you recieve bad customer service at a Tim Hortons... think of this thread.
198769,bigfish1965,2008-05-08 19:02:00,3382,"We receive regular training on The Employment Standards Act from the government lawyers. Yes they can fire you for anything, however, if they do not follow the Act, your recourse is quite easy."
198773,Headhunter,2008-05-08 19:14:00,5703,"Clampit... I have to agree with Rick, they can fire you at any time for any reason, but the Ministry of Labour will almost certainly favour the employee should it go that far and it will ... definately should the employee know his rights. If ya really want to see an Incorporation squirm... threaten them with the Ministry of Labour... it would be cheaper in the long run just to pay the employee to stay home! Please don't ask how I know this! HH"
198778,packrat,2008-05-08 19:24:00,93,"Fired is FIRED no matter how you pretty up the situation.  While it was a good move to rehire the lady in the long run will prob lose her anyway (bad karma)   Had occasion to be there done that----they sugar coat the whole issue under the old restructuring, your position is no longer necessary and unfortunately we dont have another position for you.  Goodbye and good luck in your next endeavor."
198783,loner55,2008-05-08 19:34:00,4,I think I may have been a little haste in my comment earlier.....  I think I owe a lot of you an apology. Tim Horton's should be boycotted everywhere. Do not go to Timmies!!! Everyone go to Country Style or Coffee Time but stay away from Tim's!!!    There... now maybe I won't have to wait 15 minutes to get my Tim's.  
198617,Kirk,2008-05-08 14:24:00,347,"Ain't it nice when people are generous with other people's money and inventory.  TH franchises are expensive to own and operate.  I would support termination if this was a clear policy, and after a warning for the first incident.  Capitalism works, dishonesty doesn't.  I'm sure there are many more coffee joints nearby for that employee to work at.  And F unions. LOL  PLUS : Timmys supports our local soccer club, and I doubt the TH share price on the TSE will drop as a result of a timbit.  I will buy extra to make up for any lost business, sorry Cliff."
198627,KyleM,2008-05-08 14:37:00,218,"Some of you guys think TH owes you free stuff? My brother works for the management aspect of TH and I can tell you that they do tons of stuff for local charities.  16 cent timbit or not, they dont have to give anything away.   Or you could view it as Tim Hortons did her a favour and gave her a job to maybe try and support her kids. More then likely if shes working at Tims, she couldnt go anywhere else.  People out here get paid 17.50 an hour at Tims, they dont complain."
198628,shane,2008-05-08 14:38:00,652,"  Where would I draw the line?  If I was a manager, I would give employees the right to give one timbit at a time to anyone they thought would appreciate one (with parents approval of course).  And...I would have a big bag of dog cookies at the drive-thru window for the dogs.  And...I would contribute to the local community's clean-up day instead of 'declining' like the did here.  "
198629,Zubris21,2008-05-08 14:38:00,563,"I don't believe that giving away a free tim-bit is an offense worth terminating someone over, but as many of you have mentioned there may have been many underlying stories.  As some of you mentioned employee theft is an ever growing concern for all companies big and small.  I once worked at a mass-production bakery where a similar incident occurred.  As employees we were given an opportunity to purchase the goods at a very discounted price (say $0.25 for a loaf of bread vs. $1.59 at your local loblaws) but we were not permitted to simply take the product without paying.  Now management was aware of this and since it was a fairly demanding job, they kinda turned a blind eye when products were taken without paying.  After all the profit margins were so high, and there was so much waste that it was impossible to track.  However one time, one of the better employees, was seen removing a single loaf of bread after his shift, while in street clothes.  The people who saw him were new hires, first day on the job (I think there were 3 of them) and reported this to their supervisor.  Unfortunately since the rules were in place, and consequences were strictly outlined, the supervisor was handcuffed, he had to terminate the employee who was stealing, even though there was a union in place there was nothing they could do.  The employee had broken the rules, and had to face the consequences.  I know for a fact the supervisor would not have come to that punishment had it not been 3 brand new employees as witnesses, but he had to set a precedent that employee theft was not tolerated.  My point being, perhaps there was a new class of trainees at the Tim's and the manager was trying to set an example, perhaps the rules and consequences were already outlined.  or another scenario, perhaps the previous customers child was not given a tim-bit and there was a complaint filed....  or maybe the employee was smelly....  there are tons of possible scenarios, and I doubt very much we will ever get to the bottom of it.  Personally I don't go to Tims very often, I brew my own coffee at home, but I certainly wouldn't boycott them, even if I think it is somewhat appalling that this employee was fired."
198632,pikehunter,2008-05-08 14:44:00,1659,Thanks for the ownership update Lazybum.
198489,wallyboss,2008-05-08 12:00:00,1095,All we've heard so far is the employee's side of the story.  I will be picking up my Extra Large Double Double as usual this morning and every other morning. I am sure that anybody in there right mind would fire somebody for giving a Timbit away. Unless she was already warned not to do that again!!!!
198492,Stoty,2008-05-08 12:05:00,2910,Pathetic.  The managers were probably just jealous because the child got the Timbit!!
198498,Deano,2008-05-08 12:10:00,767,"Big deal, it's just a timbit, and even if it was a donut so what. Even if all the employees took advantage of the place it might account to $100 of goods at counter prices, which is marked up so much that it's lucky if it was 10 to 20 dollars. These companies underpay people, expect quality work and professionalism, and then can't even give out a free meal as a perk, ridiculous. I like all these places where they want a days notice if your gonna be sick or take a day off, but expect people to come in and work with an hour notice. You show up for work 15min early and help out cause it's busy, and all you get is thanks for the help, but heck  if you took a timbit, you can get fired. No wonder it's getting hard to get good help, when all these people are learning companies don't really care about you. What goes around comes around, soon these places will be begging for people to work for them, it's already starting to happen."
198501,Stoty,2008-05-08 12:16:00,2910, Amen brother!
198509,bowshep,2008-05-08 12:26:00,378,"l am with Lew on this... how easy is it to blame the company. l don't see anyone working one day a year for free for the betterment of the company they work for. We all drink to much coffee anyhow.  Added note:  Then you sit in line at the drive through with the car idling. Get your food in the environmentally friendly paper products which goes into the garbage; l hope. We are damaging our environment to make our lives easier. Now the new thing is the gas boycotts it all comes form the same depot. You don't see tanker trucks with the names on them anymore. So where are you going to get the gas, if your going to boycott gas company's leave your car at home.  Its always easy to point the finger at someone else but it is us that should be ashamed because we are all hypocrites. We all want to be good for the environment but do we do everything that we can for it.  Ken"
198514,Greencoachdog,2008-05-08 12:32:00,8163," It didn't say she was working the drive thru, It sounds more like they were inside the store to me.   In Reality Being in management, I know how hard it is to terminate employee's these days. There's a lot of paperwork and documentation that has to go along with it. Terminating a non productive or problem employee can be frustrating and doesn't happen overnight. With 3 managers present, I'm sure they've done their homework.  Do you think Tim Hortons is terminating their good help? How bad of an employee would you have to be to get fired from a Timmies???"
198517,Billy Bob,2008-05-08 12:36:00,5865,Boycott THAT Tim Horton's not all of them. They are a franchise business so the corporate Tim Horton's doesn't have anything to do with it.  I drive the senior citizens to doctor appointments one day a week for the senior center in my town. I often go through Timmy's for medium cup of coffee. All the different (there are many) Timmy's here charge me $1.45 for the med coffee except one that charges $1.46 because that manager wants to get every last cent he can from his customers. The other Timmy's must round it down with tax to $1.45 so you know which one I avoid if I can for that extra cup of joe in the morning
198519,pikehunter,2008-05-08 12:45:00,1659," Pretty easy if you are found stealing, that is why they used this as an excuse to fire her. There very well could be a whole list of issues as long as your arm in regards to this employee. The ""theft of a donut hole"" is the icing on the cake for management. With this they have a legitimate reason to can her.  Another point is that perhaps this is an ongoing problem with her or with many cashiers at this location, maybe they are giving away too many freebies?  As said, we only are reading the paper's view point on this and it is one sided.  So many if's and maybe's to draw a conclusion. One thing for sure is that Horton's isn't going to be hurt by a small boycott over this."
