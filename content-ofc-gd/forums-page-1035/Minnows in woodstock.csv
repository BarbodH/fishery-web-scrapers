198845,e-z-out,2008-05-08 22:40:00,1052,Angling Outfitters Woodstock 519-539-5494 give them a call and find out they always have live bait ready to go
198880,JEREMY,2008-05-08 23:58:00,300,I just called them and they dont  sell minnows.Thanx though
198888,e-z-out,2008-05-09 00:13:00,1052,well take a look at the list i just posted and you might find a shop on the way up that stocks minnows
199055,packrat,2008-05-09 11:01:00,93,Hey Jeremy  some better directions then my pm  come into Woodstock on Dundas---when you get to Wilson turn left---go a couple blocks you'll find a double set of railway tracks---cross them and stay to your right---there is a variety store on Henry that you will see.  Good news---he has minnows (only place that I know of)  Bad news---he doesnt open until 7  HIH---see you there
199083,Tim,2008-05-09 12:12:00,1,"Theres a new store that just opened last week, small selection of tackle but the guys seem friendly and have live bait, I think its on Hwy 2 (Dundas st.) near the small drive thru Tim Hortons. Free Time Sport and Hobby"
199173,JEREMY,2008-05-09 14:29:00,300,Tahnx guys.I will see you there Gord.I might just buy minnows tonight from H&H and try and keep them alive till morning.
199199,packrat,2008-05-09 15:14:00,93,  That's going to be our game plan too Jeremy  Going to see if I can pick up some chubs/shiners from the river.  Will have some frozen smelts as well.
