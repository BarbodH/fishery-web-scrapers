Give the man the giant fuzzy giraffe! Prior to the Enron days, online trading of energy resources was impossible. Enron lobbyists wanted energy commodities open for trade online to promote speculation trading and drive up energy prices. Once exempt from commodity trading laws prices began to soar from spec investors. -Brian"

199214,largemouth,2008-05-09 16:23:00,112,if you take gas prices 10 years ago and compare it to the cost of living increases over the past decade you will find gas price rises are not as bad as you might think. it has gone up the same percentage as milk and bread and other staples. Just because it has risen quickly in the last 2 years ppl feel the need to complain. But when people pay over $1 for 500ml of bottled water or $2 for gatorade while complaining about gas increases i have to laugh.
199272,oncogene,2008-05-09 18:35:00,154,"Comparing gas to bottled water make me laugh as well tho. Those are completely 2 different things in just about every way, not to mention battled water is pretty overpriced anyway. Why not compare gas price to diamond? it'll make gas look like free! The major different IMO is for other things, ppl at least have a choice. You think bottled water is expensive? ok just fill a bottle with tap water.... You think gatorade is expensive? ok buy something else then. But with gas, there is no alternative (not like u can fill ur gas tank up with Gatorade), no choice (with all the price fixing), and u just have to buy it, unless you happen to live & work in the same area.  Having said that... if the increase gas price is making ppl more aware of saving gas, may be there's at least a bit of good to it I guess."
199286,largemouth,2008-05-09 19:10:00,112,"I agree comparing gas to bottled water is completely different since bottling water costs pennies compared to refining gasoline, yet cost the same per litre to the consumer.......My point is that the gas prices over the last decade have increased by approximitly the same % as other staples (milk, bread etc,)  Go and stand on any highway overpass and count how many hundreds of cars have one one person in it.....maybe gas prices are still to low?????"
198891,TennesseeGuy,2008-05-09 00:17:00,957,"Wayne, you're nice to think of me.  One fund, Vanguard Energy, made me enough today to buy 173 gallons of gasoline.  Enough to make my round trip from Cookeville, TN to Red Lake with another 1200 miles left.  Crude is easy and inexpensive to harvest from those huge sandpiles controlled by bad guys.  It's much more expensive to get to in Canada and the United States.  No way we can get back to low prices by drilling in North America, but I'd love to see our money staying on the continent."

199032,Guest lundboy,2008-05-09 04:19:00,0,"  Has anyone ever thought about where the money comes from that you make from these stocks?  Hmmm...  maybe out of someone else's pocket?  What you reap someone else has sowed. The commodities and stock markets are a ponzi scheme plain and simple. A transfer of wealth from the middle class.  Those of you that are participating are unknowingly (or worse yet, knowingly) participating in the downfall of your fellow man.  The money does not come from the oil companies.  You are right in that drilling for oil in North America will not lower prices...  Because the plan is to keep prices going up.  Watch this, because there is more oil to be had than anyone will admit:  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3340274697167011147"
199038,Guest lundboy,2008-05-09 04:35:00,0," Deano has got it right.  Petroleum will mean squat to everyone complaining in this thread right now, when food becomes the chosen method.  Gas prices are a slight of hand (and a huge cash cow) to keep your eyes off of the food crises coming down the pipe.  Do your research people, this is not just big oil profit taking.
