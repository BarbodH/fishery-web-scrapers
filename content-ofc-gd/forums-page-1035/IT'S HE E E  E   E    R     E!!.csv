199505,Rich Clemens,2008-05-10 11:18:00,3131,I will feel that pain.  My boat is pretty well empty and a 30 gallon fule tank.  Patsy said the other day that we'lll be spending more money on gas just taking our fishing trip than the trip itself will cost.   Couple this with my truck getting around 12 MPG while pulling the boat ....
199507,cranks bait,2008-05-10 11:21:00,721,"I'm the same as Dan, I just put it in.  I have no clue what my MPG is.  I know it's not bad, but is not great either.  I put about $30.00 every other week.  Although this weekend will be more for the trip to the cottage.  I'm not changing my boating plans, although I don't go out for just a little scoot in the morning with a coffee before work anymore.  It does make me think more about a more efficient motor though."
199515,OhioFisherman,2008-05-10 12:23:00,6623,"1.3 billion in China, 1 billion in India a paltry 300 million in the USA, it had to be expected as fuel use by those two increased demand and depletion rate would also. The oil companies own scientists predicted it back in the early 50`s.  We used up our supply of easily obtained oil here in the states in record time, a little pebble that could knock out a self proclaimed giant if supply and price go the wrong way. Unfortunately it is political suicide to suggest or implement a change in driving habits.  A report by the ATA(American Trucking Association) that its members could save 86 billion gallons of fuel over the next 10 years by slowing down. Transportation costs reflect in pricing of just about everything."
199528,JohnAB,2008-05-10 13:20:00,178,Ford F 250 gas job. Scares $150 to fill it up when empty. Seriously thinking of selling my fifth wheel trailer and the truck and going with a Chevy Colorado with the 4 cylinder 5 speed and tent for fishing from now on.

199539,Roy,2008-05-10 14:02:00,13728," You got THAT right, Dan. It's the same price for everyone else. We're all supposed to be self-sufficient. I think we can all work our way through this without whining about it."

199370,Clampet,2008-05-09 23:27:00,1947,"I heard on a newscast that SUV's are beginning to languish on the car lots, due to the rising cost of fuel.  There is a use for these type of vehicles, and sports people such as our board members make up that group.  There are however, a large number of people who live incities who will never have a legitimate use for an SUV other than to try and impress, and these are the ones who are begining to see smaller more fuel effiecient vehicles as a viable alternative.  I feel sooo bad for them."

I'm driving to PEI next monrh for a vacation, prolly our last long trip for a while. Gas is usually higher on the Island. But, at least, their Govt pegs the prices. Time they did it in ALL the Provinces."

My Honda Odyssey costs $85 now to fill and I can not go to a smaller vehicle.$1.32.9  With 3 kids I am not downsizing to something smaller.A one hour commute in my Chevy Malibu and the kids are fighting for leg room and who should sit in the middle  It tows by boat and my double axle tent trailer which weighs 2614lbs empty.  I wanted to buy a Ford F-150 in 2 years and now that will never happen.This will effect the big Three,GM,Ford and Chrysler  I guess when the kids get older I will sell the trailer and down size to a small V6 suv to pull my boat.  Ladies and Gentleman it won't be long and we will see a slump in sales for outdoor toys.The domino effect is a short time away.  Its pretty sad that some people in this world can not afford to buy rice because of rising oil.People are starving because of greed.  Hopefully someone will find an alternative source of technology and we will watch the oil companies die.  What goes around comes around you greedy buggers  Now lets go fishin."
199430,John Bacon,2008-05-10 02:22:00,3277," I don't get your logic.  You admit that a province with government pegged prices has higher prices then Ontario.  Yet, you want all provinces to start pegging the prices.  Wouldn't that mean that we would just have to pay even more for gas?"

199492,pikehunter,2008-05-10 09:12:00,1659,"Haven't filled my 97 Aerostar up for months. I put about $38 into it a couple of weeks ago and it took the gas gauge needle all the way up to the high side of the 1/2 tank mark. Used to be about $54 to $58 to fill it....oh so long ago!  I used to put in $20, $30 or fill it. Now I pay more attention to how many litres go into the tank rather than getting it to the even dollar. At Pioneer they alot their bonus points for every 10 litres purchased, so I take it to 20, 30 or 40 litres even, no more or no less. I want to get every penny in points I can out of them! Kind of a fun game to get it to land at exactly 20 litres   If you go to Pioneer go to the even 10 litre level and take advantage of the points, my son uses them up after about $10 has been accumulated, saves him some gas money and I feel like I'm giving him something."
