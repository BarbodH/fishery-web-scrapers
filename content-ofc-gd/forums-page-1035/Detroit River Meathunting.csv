199074,splashhopper,2008-05-09 12:01:00,2931,one of my fishing buddies has german shepherd that he brings with us on the Maitland river.  A few advantages for us when he brings Rex. 1: The dog goes in to the water and retrieves the fish better than I do at the shore.  2: Keeps other fishermen away from crowding us on our favourite spots.  3: Keeps the boredom at bay when the bite is off.  4: Scouts the deer out of the bush ahead of us on our walk in so i don;'t get the CRAP scared outa me in the dark.
