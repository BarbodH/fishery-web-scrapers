199063,Victor,2008-05-09 11:34:00,1609,that's an amazing trip! i enjoyed reading the entire thing!  Thanks for sharing!
199088,Tacklebuster,2008-05-09 12:18:00,303,That was an awesome report.  The colours on those fish and of the meat are amazing.
199093,Nemo,2008-05-09 12:28:00,727,Cookslav another one for the memory banks. Great work on the specks. You will be telling stories about that portage for years to come. If it ain't difficult you don't remember it. Two months from now those guys will be boasting to their buddies about the deadly portaging and the great fishing. You'll be able to chuckle to yourself as you remember them crying and whining on the trail.  Thanks  for sharing.  BTW what type of canoe did you have with you. Looks liek a Kevlar weave in the photos.  Nemo

My wife and I were just chuckling at that comment, so We went back and looked at all my fishing Pictures since 1997, and I'm wairing the Same fishing cap LOL!  I think I've actually had the same hat since 1995, but I just replaced it this year cause the old one had an unfortunate ""battery Acid"" incident.  Glad ya'll like my report, I miss the park already"

199018,douG,2008-05-09 03:52:00,2693,"Cookslav, your post shows in spades what I love about that damn place, I got back today myself from five nights, and keep looking at the pictures I took.   You do a great job on the camera, I think.  Saturday and Sunday were a challenge with an inch of rain and 30 kt  breezes on the big lake Opeongo.  Buddy says that Algonquin is like an addiction, like gambling, because both will give you a cockeyed return on your investment.  Sometimes you lose, sometime you win, but when you win, it is the greatest thing going.  Solitude, wilderness, family and friends, challenges, successes and failures, too.  Thanks for the great effort it took to post such a great triplog.  I hope you can share with our friends on Algonquin Adventures."
199021,Greencoachdog,2008-05-09 03:55:00,8163,  ... aboot those pics you took and keep looking at... we're waiting!
