199257,MNMOXIE,2008-05-09 18:01:00,1,I hope someone can answer my question.  A group of us will be fishing Carillion Lake (approx. 200 mi due north of Ft Frances and is located between Birch Lake and Cat Lake) in about 2 1/2 weeks.  I am getting concerned that the ice will not be off the lake by then...since the lakes on the Minnesota/Ontarion boarder still have considerable ice (MN fishing opener is tomorrow).  Can someone give me a good idea or assurances that I have nothing to worry about?  Thanks

I guess it depends on whether or not we get some rain.  I'm on gullrock and each day it opens up on my shore line, at night it re-freezes. Temps are below zero each night and it doesn't help the melt.  There are some of the smaller lakes open on the highway from Vermilion Bay to Red Lake but all the bigger lakes are still ice bound."
