Very useful information and am glad to have stumbled across this webpage.  My dad and I finally booked our first fly-in trip with Cochrane Air into Magiskan Lake in early Jun.  Very excited.  We used to fish Nipissing regularly in 70s/80s and have not really caught a decent amount of fish since then - the size and quantity of fish referred to in other posts is simply mind blowing!  Am looking for some advice:  - my rods are all medium action.  We want to hit some big pike - should I be using a Medium Heavy  or Heavy rod? - read one post where someone wrote that the big lures/jigs/spinners are not as effective as small ones this far north - so am completely confused about what tackle to bring.  I've stocked up on 1/4 and 1/8 jigs and plastics, and have a bunch of old williams spoons - what do you folks recommend? - if we are aiming for the big northerns, what test line should we be using?  I have many questions - just spent 45mins on Cabelas looking at rods and reels and am completely confused!  That'll teach me for not staying current with the new gear and techniques.  Thanks"
