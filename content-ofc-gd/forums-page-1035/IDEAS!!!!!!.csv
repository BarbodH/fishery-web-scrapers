198234,Abberz,2008-05-07 23:09:00,140,"Spinnerbaits, jig and pigs, weighted soft plastics.  I just put a similar combo together yesterday.....Quantum PT Tour ed. with a PT rod....can't wait for bass to open!  You will enjoy it.....it's a versitile combo."
198248,GbayGiant,2008-05-07 23:33:00,1780,"Well look at the rod and use the recommended weight of lure probably 1/2-1oz, and after that I'd say bass or pike fishing. Heavier jigs, spinnerbaits, big spoons, big crank baits, basically whatever you want in that weight range."

198477,Garry2Rs,2008-05-08 11:34:00,1425,"As other have said, this is a great all around rod. Traditionally Bass baits weight about 3/8 of an ounce, which is right in the middle of most MH rods range. That is not a coincidence. It will handle most Spinnerbaits, Crankbaits, Swimbaits, Jerk baits, Glide baits, Spoons, Frogs & Rats, Texas and Carolina Rigs, Tubes, and small Bucktails.  In a pinch, at 7 feet, it will handle Jig&Pig, almost as well as a Flipping Stick. Match the weight of the lures to the rod and go fishing! Garry2R's"
198482,Greencoachdog,2008-05-08 11:43:00,8163,"I'd use it for larger fish in heavy cover... or  Bluegills, I catch BIG Bluegills."
198793,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-08 19:57:00,3761,"Thanks for the tips. Im not to sure on using crankbaits on it...i like a softer action rod, but jerkbaits for sure aswell as the other lures you guys mentioned."
198863,Garry2Rs,2008-05-08 23:22:00,1425,"Yeah I heard all that soft action gives you a better presentation stuff too, but I only lost two big Bass while I was in Arizona this past winter. Both were lost off of lipless cranks on a beautiful G.Loomis Crankbait rod... My seven foot MH Shimano Crucial stuck them so they stayed stuck!   Now, those fish might have been coming off anyway, but I feel like I get better hook sets with the stiffer rod. You do what you think is best, and I'll do the same...Grin."
