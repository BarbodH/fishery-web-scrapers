198939,Marko,2008-05-09 01:38:00,854,"Went out for couple of hours today, was more curious if the fish were in there yet then catching some. I never hook into anything decent in this place untill the water levels go way down. Water was good 5-6 feet higher then i remember it last fall. Here are couple of pics of the lake         Fish were splashing in the weeds that have flooded, and the bite was slow. Only thing that was actually biting were bullheads, untill this fella came along.    Caught me off guard and took me into some branches that were sitting on the shore, thank god i was using my 11 footer rod and was able to pull him out of there. In all excitement i forgot to take my team logo out of my bag and take a pic with it, could have kicked myself in the ass when i threw the fish back and realized i didnt take the pic that i needed. Ahhh next time Sorry Team 6"
199010,wolfville,2008-05-09 03:36:00,396,Nice fish and beautiful swim. Wish I lived close to one of those places.
199025,Greencoachdog,2008-05-09 04:01:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!   Would that happen to be a Steelhead net?
199065,Victor,2008-05-09 11:36:00,1609,looks to be a really nice/quiet spot. i find fish that size fight fairly good
199100,MJL,2008-05-09 12:44:00,2427,Nicely done.  Carp of any size pull like submarines.  Loving the pics.
199104,ccmtcanada,2008-05-09 12:50:00,7971,Great report and pics!  Don't worry bout the tourney sign....I have a feeling you'll be pulling bigger ones from that spot in the near future!
199126,Marko,2008-05-09 13:18:00,854,"Hopefully i will and with the help of my trusty Steelhead net haha She was a virgin untill last night, 13.99 at Le Baron`s."
199230,ccmtcanada,2008-05-09 17:19:00,7971, You're such an elitist.....  
199237,Marko,2008-05-09 17:34:00,854,I figured why buy a huge net for tiny little carp that i catch. If they were big carp like u and Bly catch then i would have bought 19.99 net. haha Plus your fish makes mine look like babies
199252,Bly,2008-05-09 18:00:00,1556,"Congrats!  What a nice looking area to fish.  That carp doesn't look like a baby, maybe late teen      Enjoy and I am sure you will catch another for your team!"
