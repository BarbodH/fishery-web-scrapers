At this point I just wanted to get rid of my skunk streak which has lasted    months!  The action was great. Just used worms and caught every couple of minutes. Gotta love the fight of a sucker on an ultralight with 4 pound test. Ended up catching  16 in about an hour. All fished were released. Here's a couple of pics.  "
198934,e-z-out,2008-05-09 01:30:00,1052,Got to love the suckers they do put up a fight. Good job angler
198964,sharper,2008-05-09 02:14:00,279,That looks fun!
198967,huntervasili,2008-05-09 02:17:00,1604," Glad to hear, dont want to reduce their population   Good job getting out and getting some fish"
198978,Marko,2008-05-09 02:36:00,854,"nasty buggers lol they are everywhere. Good catch tho, 16 in an hour of anything is a lot of fun."
198982,BillM,2008-05-09 02:41:00,17367,Good muskie bait.
198985,MuddyWater,2008-05-09 02:50:00,218,i was fishing for browns the other day in the ganny and my float went under and i set it and was like YES a 5lb brown. then it came closer and i was so angry stupid smelly ugly creatures. i bet they would be fun on a 3-4 wt fly rod tho. what ever floats ya boat!
198987,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-09 02:52:00,698,LOL! a lot of hate on the suckers!    Some people like sunfish and perch on ultralights I enjoy the suckers. One day I'll try eating them as I heard they are pretty good.......then again maybe not!
199067,Victor,2008-05-09 11:38:00,1609,"yup it's lots of fun ... it's like a ""warm-up"" for the season for other species"
199081,ccmtcanada,2008-05-09 12:08:00,7971,Way to go!!  They put up a pretty good fight on ultralight gear don't they?  Looks looks you had a great time out there.  Congrats!
199098,MJL,2008-05-09 12:37:00,2427,"Suckers can be a total blast to catch.  I go out a few times a year for them myself.  If you're lucky enough to hook into a big redhorse, it's triple the fun.  Great report and pics"

199295,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-09 19:27:00,3761,What do you do just throw out a worm and a sinker to keep it on bottom?
199314,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-09 20:16:00,698,"  I don't even use a sinker, too many snags. Just used a number 4 hook and a worm, casted out to the pool, let it sink and waited for a bite."
199337,tdotfisherman,2008-05-09 21:39:00,317, Back to basics.. I like it.
199428,pikeie,2008-05-10 02:18:00,380,"heres the way i like to catch them! 3.5 Lbs tippet size 6 heavely weighted stonefly, and a size 14 hares ear or scud trailing the stone. tons of fun. good practice for trout  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1210385703 http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1210385832"
