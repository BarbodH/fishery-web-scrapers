199076,Beats,2008-05-09 12:03:00,543,http://www.gettinghooked.net/Episodes.htm   These are great shows.  The only drawback is that these guys(mostly Barry) are just WAY too excited and into everything they do in the shows.  I know they need to get an audience but its really pretty ridiculous.   Good info and techniques but they make even the smallest panfish sound like they are reeling in a monster.
199119,blaque,2008-05-09 13:10:00,2419,Getting hooked does put out some awesome shows......I enjoy them a ton. Mostly because i fish alot of the same waters they are fishing. Alot of it applies directly to what i may very well be fishing the upcoming weekend. And they're both great. Yeah they are enthusiastic......but i think its pretty genuine. I know Id be fired up if i was in that position.
199141,Marko,2008-05-09 13:39:00,854,YOutube works for everything. Just type what kind of fishing u r interested in or what type of fish and you`ll get dozens of videos.
