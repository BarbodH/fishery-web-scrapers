Not only was the weather not cooperating, the fishing was somewhat sparatic.  In saying that I managed a few fish and had an amazing time telling fish stories and sharing time in great company.  Maybe next year!!!   Sonny getting ready for a full night of fishing!  The bet between the five of us for big fish of the weekend.  It went to Eastman...  Gloomy weather, with a chilly rain.  Big hugs for the little fish... I was so excited... lol  My go to lure... However if you ask Sonny I went to every lure in my tackle box... Heck they all wanted attention.  Bet Winning fish, however the holder of them did not catch any fish all weekend. Poor Jerry:(  The run back to the park on Saturday night was pretty wet... Poor Eastman   There were a lot of people out on the Bay all bringing in fish and having an amazing time...  Looking forward to next year already!  Cheers,  Jen"
