198816,irishfield,2008-05-08 21:35:00,26272,Only Free ramp that I know of is Pete Peterson Park in Midland... but you can't park there without a resident of Midland sticker. That said.. you can launch and then go back out and park on the side of Sunnyside Drive on the wide east dirt shoulder. There aren't any no parking signs there... well at least until everyone starts doing what I keep suggesting. You're supposed to go into Bay Port Marina and pay them to park your rig if a non-resident.

198971,BillM,2008-05-09 02:22:00,17367,"I was just about to ask this question, oldman wants to hit North/South Bay near Honey Harbour this weekend.  Any idea what the Marina charges?"
198972,muskymike,2008-05-09 02:25:00,772,"They are all usually either $8 or $10 in and the same out around that area. I always launch at my buddies cottage except when they are not there, i cant. I would just call them if i were you bill."
198979,BillM,2008-05-09 02:39:00,17367,"Mike, I'll most likely give them a ring tomorrow   thanks bud.  You ready for Muskie season?  We gotta get out a few times!!!!"
199112,muskymike,2008-05-09 13:05:00,772,"Oh I am ready, I think i am going to head out to JB's this weekend again and pick up another rod and reel and a few more lures i dont need.  yeah i am definitely up for going out a few times"
199178,BillM,2008-05-09 14:40:00,17367,"I was there yesterday, what an awesome place!!  I couldn't get over the size of some of those BullDawg type baits they had (like 3ft long!)"
