199461,shmirwin,2008-05-10 03:51:00,5,any one know a website that has descriptions of different types of retrieves
199508,Greencoachdog,2008-05-10 11:23:00,8163,"Don't know of a website, but you should vary your retrieves until a fish bites... then try to remember what retrieve you were using when you caught it"
199511,OhioFisherman,2008-05-10 11:44:00,6623,"I don`t know if any one does the exact same retrieve as another person using the same lure, some are probably real close but the human factor.  Any particular lure? and what are you trying to do with it? fish species? Most lures and retrieve variations will work for more than one species of fish."
199525,johnnyb,2008-05-10 12:53:00,3413,"When using a lure for the first time,  toss it in on a short line so you can see it in the water, then experiment with a couple different retrieve methods, to see what it actually looks like.  Find an action you think looks good, then make your cast and impart that action."

It all depends on the fish really. I will say one thing. When they are aggrisive,it,s a blast. Almost rip the rod right out of your hands."
