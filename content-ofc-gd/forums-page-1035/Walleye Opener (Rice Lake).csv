197968,brooks999,2008-05-07 15:15:00,38,I am looking to go out on Rice lake this Saturday for the Walleye/Pike Opener. (Weather Permitting)  We are new to fishing and this is the first year having a boat....  I am not asking for your honey hole....Just want to know where is the best place to launch my 14' Aluminum w/9.9  We are closest to Hastings but will trailer the boat to any launch.  Thanks in Advance
197971,Stoty,2008-05-07 15:18:00,2910,"Launch in Harwood if you can.  Fish the ""gap"" in Harwood, or jet across the lake to the mouth of the Otonabee River."
197989,edmichit,2008-05-07 15:52:00,145,be careful of the submerged railway between tick Island and the north shore. Rice has channel markers in those areas for a reason.
198073,Blue_Axela,2008-05-07 18:32:00,88,"You won't find any pike in Rice, but plenty of eyes.  There are plenty of launches over the lake but Harwood is a good place to start.  If you want another alternative, you can launch from Bewdley and troll east towards Long Island."
198527,brooks999,2008-05-08 12:55:00,38,"Awesome responses, Thanks....  Where is the launch in Harwood (I will try to find it on google maps) and is there parking there for my truck?  Thanks again"
198536,Stoty,2008-05-08 13:04:00,2910,"Yes, there is parking on the street, but might want to get there early, because it will fill up FAST.  Look at this map, and zoom in. Front Street is the launch.  Harwood Map"
198538,Stoty,2008-05-08 13:06:00,2910,"Come to think of it, the launch is at a ""resort"" (for lack of better word) at the end of front street. You might need to bring $5 with you."
198550,brooks999,2008-05-08 13:30:00,38,"I saw it on Front Street.....will check it out for sure and will be there Bright and Early.  Here is another...probably stupid, question.  Do I have to use a boat launch? It is only a light 14' Aluminum, There is a park that we can park in then just carry and drop it in the water. The 9.9 is light as hell too.  Just a thought.....again as you can tell I am totally new to this"
198558,Stoty,2008-05-08 13:40:00,2910,"I was going to mention that to you. Yes there is a park there, that a lot of people just back down to, and unload their boats by hand.  do that for sure, then you can park right there as well."
198681,brooks999,2008-05-08 15:34:00,38,Cool Thanks

199187,Stoty,2008-05-09 14:55:00,2910,"Nice article, lots of great info, but too much self-promotion at the end..."
199194,brooks999,2008-05-09 15:04:00,38,Great Article....Thanks
199210,ranger520vx,2008-05-09 16:06:00,164,  You should talk about self-promotion-its right in your signature pushing your little web dev gig............Glad you like the article though...
199211,Stoty,2008-05-09 16:08:00,2910,LOL
199212,Stoty,2008-05-09 16:14:00,2910,Self-promoting and talking down to people...
199253,Blue_Axela,2008-05-09 18:01:00,88,  Hahaha...right on bro.
199369,Zamboni,2008-05-09 23:24:00,235,DL and print Rice Lake charts from pm I sent you-should help.  Not giving away any secrets to say river mouths should be good (and busy).
