198959,HTHM,2008-05-09 02:11:00,4082,Well the bones are in except for the fish(structure)finder. Here is the before pic   Here is the layout at the pilot's seat   Here is the Bowmount aquired from Rangerguy 
198960,HTHM,2008-05-09 02:12:00,4082,Here is the self-designed anchor winch 
199041,Sinker,2008-05-09 04:40:00,8692,"That anchor is gonna hold, thats for sure!!  Thats a good little set up for fishing. I fished out of a boat just like that for years. ( is it a sunray?)  Have fun, be safe and good fishing!!  Sinker"
199134,pikehunter,2008-05-09 13:31:00,1659,"My cousin had a 14' FG boat very similar to yours with the bow being covered, great place to keep spare lifejackets, things dry and out of the sun. His was made by a company in New Liskeard.  Looks like an efficient fishing machine"
199192,aplumma,2008-05-09 15:01:00,6896,Were is the refrigerator and the bar???? Looks like a great way to go fishin nice job.  Art
199200,Gerritt,2008-05-09 15:14:00,6129,Looking good Albert!  G
199218,Cast-Away,2008-05-09 16:58:00,790,"I like the solar powered motor shown in picture #3! If you plan on using the boat alot, you might want to consider adding a livewell into the middle seat?"
199219,HTHM,2008-05-09 17:01:00,4082,Thanks for the kind words. The boat is a Mattaue (sp?) made in Quebec.  A company that is no longer in operation as I understand it. Just got the batteries today so now the question is.....What depth do I run the trolling motor at?
199266,RangerGuy,2008-05-09 18:22:00,564,Glad to see the TM worked well for ya  TIGHT LINES!
199267,ccmtcanada,2008-05-09 18:27:00,7971,Sweet setup!  Hope you get out there soon to put some new slime in it!
199273,Jigatollah,2008-05-09 18:35:00,53,"Good looking set up you got there. The only thing different I would have done is to install the electric motor more in centre of the boat so when let down, it pulls straight. It shouldn't affect it though the way you have it on. Have fun."
199300,Reef Runner,2008-05-09 19:31:00,981,Lookin good.  Just need some scantly clad bikini models and your good to go.
199403,Lostchild,2008-05-10 01:00:00,153,"Hard to tell if you have them from the pictures, but if you don't, I would add side-marker lights on your trailer. Outside of that, you have a nice and practical fishing vessel there!"
199427,Mike the Pike,2008-05-10 02:17:00,3421,lookin good Hometown.  I would go manual with the anchor though.  Time to get her slimed enjoy your summer in her.  MTP
199443,bassmastermike,2008-05-10 03:03:00,295,Looks Great !!! Hope to see you on the water.
199477,HTHM,2008-05-10 05:07:00,4082,"Me too, as opposed to IN the water..........."
