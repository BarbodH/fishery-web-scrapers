198920,e-z-out,2008-05-09 00:56:00,1052,There are a few guys on the site that fish the islands. Great fishing from what i've been told. Give it a try and do a report after

The Toronto harbour has many basins that hold pike as does the island.  Walking the basins from the ferry to spadina st. is a good start.   For the islands, start with taking the ferry to hanlen's or center and look for weed beds adjacent to deep water.  Spinnerbaits and jerkbaits should do the trick.   good luck!"
