199316,Stoty,2008-05-09 20:21:00,2910,The Decals and Certificates are very nice this year. I just recieved 2 in the mail. Nice enough to be framed actually.
199318,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-09 20:23:00,3761,I got 2 last year.
199324,grt1,2008-05-09 20:34:00,638,I put the stickers inside my boat right beside my measuring tape decal. They are great for a reminder that big fish are there to put back and get your fishing buddies thinking the same way.

Sometimes I think they need to play closer attention to some of the entries they approve.  Some look like they measured the fish in centemeters, then posted it as inches using the same number.  LOL!  But other than a chuckle about it, who cares really?"
