Turn right on Dundas, and the entrance to the park will be on your left.  If you're going tomorrow (Sunday), be warned:  The Mississauga Marathon is being run that day, and that part of Mississauga Road will be shut down in the morning since it's part of the route.  It will be a very difficult area to access."
