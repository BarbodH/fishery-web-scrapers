349285,ADB,2009-06-07 18:50:00,444,"Looking to head to Scugog on Wednesday.  I've searched online, but haven't been able to find much in terms of rentals.  I did rent out of Port Perry two years ago, but I wasn't impressed with that marina, nor the section of the lake.  Any recommendations?"
349291,GBW,2009-06-07 19:04:00,8460,did you try Goreski's?
349339,ccmtcanada,2009-06-07 20:40:00,7971,Island Marina on the island is good.  Their rentals are all just a few years old.  Less weedy on that side of the lake as well.
349382,mikeh,2009-06-07 22:13:00,824,There is a marina across from Goreski's and about 1 km south that has rentals with 15 -20hp motors for a fair price. Don't know the name of it though.
349385,fish-miester,2009-06-07 22:16:00,864,"its called ""West shore marina"" (on the west side of the lake right across Goreski's)  as well try Goreski's , or island marina."
349403,mepps,2009-06-07 22:59:00,1301,"I've rented 4-5 times on Scogog, always from teh same place - its located on Whitfield Road, but isnt showing when I google boat rentals. It was $70 for the day (7a-7p) last time I went (may be more now) The other locations cost more as far as I know.   head to local.google.com and search boat rental, port perry  You'll get a few other options... http://local.google.com/maps?f=q&sourc...e=UTF8&z=12"
349513,fish-miester,2009-06-08 03:47:00,864,"head straight north on simcoe, out of port perry, till you hit ""the trading post"" which is  Whitfield road, take whitefield road to the end, and u reach the lake.. with the marina on your left, which is West shore marina"
