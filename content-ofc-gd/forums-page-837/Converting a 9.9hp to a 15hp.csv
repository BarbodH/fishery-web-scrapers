349221,fisherman7,2009-06-07 15:55:00,325,"I wrote about having this done some time ago but can't find post. I said I'd update the group when I had a chance to water test it. Well, had a chance yesterday on Couch. I still had to lean forward to get the dingy/inflatable/tender to plane, but once it planed, Holy! I didn't even give it full throttle. Goes like stink.  I do believe I have figured out why it won't plane. My inflatable has long tubes that extend about 18"" past the transom. Creates a lot of drag but stable when on plane. You lose a lot of interior room though. Live and learn."

349256,fish-miester,2009-06-07 17:14:00,864,i heard i can swap carbs from my 9.9 evinrude (believe its a 88) and replace it with a 15. but how good can that be for my motor?
349333,bigpikemike,2009-06-07 20:17:00,52,9.9 and 15hp in johnson and evinrude are the same motor just diferent carbs along with a couple other miner differences.....couple tweeks and u can get it up to 25-30hp...if u want a number of a mechanice that can do it for u pm me
349335,fish-miester,2009-06-07 20:19:00,864,I would be interested though Aylmer is a bit far
349376,fisherman7,2009-06-07 21:56:00,325,It's a 9.9 Yamaha. All that needed to be done was remove a stop. Mechanic told me it's the only Yamaha model that you do it with.
349388,2 tone z71,2009-06-07 22:25:00,1311,"25 30 hp out a 9.9-15 hmmmm hmmmm not calling Bull just hmmmm,few tweaks eh ,you couldent fit a big enough prop on the shaft to clear the case to make use of all that extra hp the gears in the case would near explode with 30 hp"
349394,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-07 22:44:00,10439,  If you don't have one put on one of these Hydrofoils for your motor. They provide lift at the motor and it will get you up on plane faster and at a slower speed.   Another option for inflatables is a set of trim tabs like these. If you can afford it this is the better option.
