348968,wallyboss,2009-06-06 20:45:00,1095,Buddy of mine bought this one at CTC for about 100.00 and he loves it nice and light. I tried it today and it a charm to fish with. It's the Daiwa Megaforce.  http://www.daiwa.com/Reel/detail.aspx?ID=234
348973,JohnF,2009-06-06 21:03:00,3494," I'm looking at that one at the local FishingStore but he has it for a lot less money. I've checked the reviews and the twitching bar feature seems to be prone to failure. I like the concept of it for taking up slack line & for working surface and suspending lures but I don't like the idea of a failed component, even if it doesn't affect the rest of the functions. I like my stuff to be working 100%, even if I'm not using the feature. One failure suggests other possible failures.  Anyone else had any experience with twitching bars and this particular reel?

348986,Garry2Rs,2009-06-06 22:01:00,1425,"Check Cabela's Canada.  Within the last three months they had your blue reel for $99.00. They may be discontinued, but you're getting a super reel at a disposable reel price."
348994,JohnF,2009-06-06 22:21:00,3494, I'd be very happy to get another one of those for that price. I'll check it.  JF
348997,JohnF,2009-06-06 22:27:00,3494,Looks like they're back up to $189. I like mine but not enuf to pay that for a light duty reel.  JF
349015,Greencoachdog,2009-06-06 23:28:00,8163,"Shop around, especially online... it's a little early for deals right now, but a little later in the season and you should be able to pick up something nice in your price range.  Are you left handed or right handed?  Where's that new boat you're going to pull with that new Ford Flex???"
349016,glen,2009-06-06 23:35:00,2641,I have been flogging a Abu Silver Max.  Its small its light and i like it.
349027,JohnF,2009-06-07 00:01:00,3494," I'm right-handed but being a Canuckian raised on the rink I have to crank with my left hand.  The boat will come soon. I just have to get the okay from SWMBO. I'm thinking I'll slide into it with a Kayak, then a transom canoe, then a motor for it, then a boat. Too bad she gave up water skiing. I thought that would be my in.  JF"
349031,Greencoachdog,2009-06-07 00:16:00,8163,"  That happens to be the proper ""American"" way to do it!!!  ... I'm also right handed and cast with my right arm and crank with my left hand!... changing hands is for gurly guys!... wait a second, I'm retarded and can't make a little circle with my left thumb and forefinger!  ... and don't get me started on left handed people!!!"

349535,mikeymikey,2009-06-08 07:50:00,376,If you shop from cabelas.ca do they ship from within Canada? or does it still get shipped from US?
349698,scugpg,2009-06-08 17:52:00,1373, I found the selection sucks and you always pay shipping! It does come from Canada I believe though.  John: Drive down to Angling Outfitters and talk to Chris or Jocelyn. I'm quite confident they will hook you up with a good deal.
349714,JohnF,2009-06-08 18:07:00,3494, We have a shop here in Stratford run by one of Jocelyn's proteges. He treats me pretty well. I got my Quantum baitcaster there last year for $100 with the rebate. Can't come close to that this year. I'd buy from him anyway but like to have input from reel users before I go shopping.  JF
