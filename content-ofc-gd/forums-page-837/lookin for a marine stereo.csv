I have seen a few for  around 250-350 price but I don't want to spend that much.. I want to install on the boat before July holidays. So if you know of one for  a descent price or have one your looking to get rid of let me know please."

I assume if you mount it in an out of the way spot any deck should be alright, or am i wrong...they're THAT different than regular head units.  ryan"
