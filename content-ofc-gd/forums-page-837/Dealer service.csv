But Crestliner did a nutty thing when they mounted the fire extinguisher right in the middle of a super-handy shelf (see photo, you can just see the extinguisher on the shelf)  Any who, I emailed my dealer (Proctor Marine, Simcoe) to see if I was allowed to move it without messing anything up (like, the warranty). I got a return email the next day not only giving me the green light, but telling me of a couple of location ideas as well as an attached photo of their preferred spot. I mean he actually unclipped a fire extinguisher and photographed it in another spot, then emailed it to me.  Doug Heighington is the man. I mean, how many guys would do this? Jim"

I wanted to put it where they showed you, but my side compartment would not open then.  My dealer did basically the same things going over my boat to find a spot.  In his words.  Why does such a simple thing seem to be so hard to do.  The conclusion was at my feet, not the greatest spot, but it works."
