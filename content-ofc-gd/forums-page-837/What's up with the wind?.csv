349089,Cudz,2009-06-07 03:42:00,2652,Seems to be windy every day.  I don't mind a bit of wind but for that last 3 or 4 years it has seemed to be really windy.  Maybe I am just going insane. I like 5 km/h winds not 30!  Ruins my fishing in my 11'6 boat.
349090,jediangler,2009-06-07 03:46:00,1923,"Today they predicted 15km/h for Bobcaygeon and it hit 31km/h by 12noon. My boat is 12'2"" and only weighs 36lbs so wind can ruin my day."
349098,Nippissinger,2009-06-07 04:22:00,53,"I here ya...I have a 15'5 aluminum closed bow and the 25km winds ruined a good day on Lake Erie..  Oh well, will keep trying.  Willy  A Bad Day of Fishin' still beats a Good Day at Work..."
349116,Greencoachdog,2009-06-07 10:35:00,8163,I heard it's always windy in Ontario because Manitoba blows and Quebec sucks.
349118,Terry,2009-06-07 10:41:00,14456,"Heard that too...LOL  it's  the great lakes, they control the weather in the area and hold the jet stream in place smack over  top of us ....."
349128,Cudz,2009-06-07 11:16:00,2652,lol! That could very well be it.
349156,siwash,2009-06-07 12:54:00,683,"you need to re-title this thread: ""WHST'S UP WITH THIS WEATHER""  It's been crappy for a good three weeks now.. ever since May 24. We almost got frost here in Vaughan (just north of Steeles, aka Toronto) last week! It was about 2C. I cannot remember the last time it got that cool... normal temps for this time of the year down here should be 24C"
349171,Radnine,2009-06-07 13:22:00,1538,"A classic! I was saying the same thing last week when we were at Rice Lake, the wind has been crazy this spring. It makes Erie an impossibility for my boat and larger inland lakes become dodgy (Simcoe, Rice). Hopefully things calm down soon. Jim"
