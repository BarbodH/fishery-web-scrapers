He is going to go and try and get the trailer into his name tomorrow, but we are unsure what to do regarding the boat, I'm under the impression that if the boat has less than a 10 hp motor it does not require licensing or any kind of registration/ ownership, is this correct?"
349445,Terry,2009-06-08 00:54:00,14456,yup they don't need paper work on the boat and motor but there should be for the trailer
349446,Sinker,2009-06-08 00:54:00,8692,You are correct.
349448,Dara,2009-06-08 00:58:00,3052,If he wants it gone...make it gone.  It took me allmost 15 minutes to sell my 14'er
349475,GeorgeJ,2009-06-08 01:59:00,207,"ok thanks for the fast responses, I don't need another boat but I can't pass it up   hopefully it will be home tomorrow! I've restored a old out boards and hope to do more as I find them. It will be a great little test boat for these old motors."
