349464,JohnF,2009-06-08 01:37:00,3494,Perhaps not everyone's taste in music but I always liked him. Gonna kick back now and watch the rest of the show.  JF
349465,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-08 01:39:00,2038,Leonard Cohen= I just don't get it   :dunno:
349471,jediangler,2009-06-08 01:51:00,1923,Maybe the greatest songwriter and poet Canada has ever produced. 
349658,legacey,2009-06-08 16:21:00,127,He played here in Kingston a few weeks back....people that saw him said he was fantastic!  Cheers
349670,JohnF,2009-06-08 16:49:00,3494, Listen to his lyrics. He nails so many of the little things that usually escape us. I gues ya gotta be a little bit into the hippy poet schtick from the good old days.  JF
349685,hirk,2009-06-08 17:20:00,571,"Love em, an amazing talent!!! A little deep for the ""Twisted Sister"" crowd maybe lol"
349718,JohnF,2009-06-08 18:13:00,3494, My son the bass player says that his musician friends are all saying the Cohen Tour going on now is awesome.  We have to remember that Cohen fans favoured black before it meant goth.  JF
349724,Terry,2009-06-08 18:27:00,14456,"Hallelujah, wish I saw him last night"
349730,JohnF,2009-06-08 18:32:00,3494, He did that. Great rendition. That show's been on a few times. Watch for it coming around again.  JF

349760,Roy,2009-06-08 19:29:00,13728,"Nice!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttv5dyvtF4o   Can't be embedded, by request."
349762,Terry,2009-06-08 19:37:00,14456,"I have seen that one before, was it recorded from the tv show?  over the years, he sure has changed the words to the song...... it may be the most recorded modern song in the world but it took shrek, to make it popular again"
349764,JohnF,2009-06-08 19:38:00,3494," Not from last night's show, but the same backup singers.  JF"
349770,Roy,2009-06-08 19:43:00,13728,"That was one of the featured songs in Shrek, believe it or not."
