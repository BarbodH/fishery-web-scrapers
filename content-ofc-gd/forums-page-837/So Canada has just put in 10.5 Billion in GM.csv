348514,holdfast,2009-06-04 23:38:00,1813,"  They are Pissed.  They Blame Central Canada, (Ontario), The Opposition Parties, and Basically feel they're nothing but second rate Canadian citizens and the Prime Minister is being forced to do this as a Minority Government thanks to you know who.  Its just not the Forestry workers either.  Its 95 percent Westerners except Vancouver.  Pretend your a Westerner and turn on CBC.  You might see what I mean."
348587,ch312,2009-06-05 03:12:00,1590," why should MY tax dollars be given to those who were promised a pension from GM? i do not have any association with GM, so why should my money go to its workers or previous employees? they should be getting a normal government pension like other seniors who do not get a pension from their employer or those who's previous employers went under.  our money could be used for much better things than spoiled ex union workers"
348589,Fishnwire,2009-06-05 03:25:00,983," Yes the members get to vote on the executive.  Do you think they were given a choice of a lot of candidates running on the ""We're too greedy and lazy"" platform?  Maybe you think they should have demanded to go out on strike unless they had their pay cut?  Like most working people, they probably felt they had worked for, and deserved every penny they earned.  Isn't that how you feel about your paycheck?   They made an excellent working class wage.  What's so wrong with that?  They made enough to pay their mortgages, for their family vehicles, to raise their kids and maybe had a little left over to buy a couple of toys.  None of these guys ever got rich doing their job, so in that way they definately are not lawyers.  You're right that they made more than other assembly line workers, which made it easier for other assembly line workers to justify asking for raises of their own.  More people with good paying jobs is good for the economy, right?...As a matter of fact, more people with good paying jobs is the very definition of a good economy, as far as I'm concerned.   The collective agreemnts between the company and union (which you feel the workers were ""greedy"" by accepting) were ratified when GM was one of the biggest and most profitable corporations in the world.  I thought that was obvious.   I didn't put words in your mouth, dude.  I'm attempting to illustrate how both ways of thinking are equally illogical.   This has been fun but I'm off to camp for 4 days.  I can only hope this thread will be buried by the time I get back.  Cheers and tight lines, all."
348613,Chris,2009-06-05 10:44:00,405," Not if it helps bankrupt the company they work for. You surely must understand supply and demand.....that consumers are not a bottomless pit. If a good chunk of the price of their new car goes to paying for higher than average wages, over-the-top benefits, pensions and legacy costs for the employees, something else has to suffer....quality of the auto maybe. Mine surely is a piece of crap.  GM had rear brake problems on mid-sized sedans for most of the late 80's and 90's. Why was this engineering problem never fixed in almost 15 years? Guess it's easier to screw the customer....let him put new rear brakes on every year. Or what about the paint problem GM still has with their vehicles. How many GM's have you seen with paint peeling off? They have had this problem for years yet....not only do they turn their back on their customers who have this problem, they have made no attempt to fix the problem on cars still coming off the assembly line.  I don't think GM gets it even now. I keep seeing their ceo's and reps on tv saying that the ""new"" GM has to start looking at new features and styles that customers want. How about forget the blinking lights, on-star, self-locking doors, keyless entry and other gizmo crap and start manufacturing quality products that stay on the road?  Besides, if their employees are still trying to justify their compensation package, I guess that GM is still in big trouble."
348635,holdfast,2009-06-05 12:57:00,1813,Agreed
348652,Jonny,2009-06-05 14:10:00,1380,"I'm in agreement with Fishnwire in just about everything he says.  As far as GM is concerned (and Ford and Chrysler too), I think that what they should do is start offering a manufacturer's warranty for their vehicles the same as Toyota and some of the other foreign makes --- a three-year bumper-to-bumper warranty. Never mind just the power train (with exceptions).  Offer the bumper-to-bumper, and build to that quality. That would do more IMO than other fancy gimmicks to gain them sales."
348654,POLLIWOGG,2009-06-05 14:25:00,835,"Once the $3K car from India gets here you won't have to worry about expensive repairs, you just replace the car."
348655,Jonny,2009-06-05 14:30:00,1380," Once the $3K car from India gets here and is upgraded for Canadian conditions and certified for Canadian roads, it'll cost $12K."
348659,Stoty,2009-06-05 14:35:00,2910, AMEN brother. It's too bad the Prime Minister doesnt think like that too.
348697,Jonny,2009-06-05 16:51:00,1380," Probably a number of reasons, two of which might be:  1. The money is not likely being paid specifically to the pensions; it's being paid to cover the GM shortfall, of which the pensions are a part. Would it sound better if that money was earmarked for other areas (though still part of the same pot)?  2. GM screwed up bigtime, no question. Part of the screw-up, if I recall correctly, was raiding the pension plan so there was an unfunded shortfall. That's the company's fault, not the workers'.  The GM workers are lucky that their pensions are bound up in the much bigger issue of the failure of the company and the loss of a large chunk of our industrial base, or else the gov't probably would have done the same as it has done when other companies used pension funds greedily or unwisely --- nothing. In Northern Ontario I've seen too many workers in the mines and resource industries lose pensions, or part of them, because of shady, unethical dealings by the companies they worked for.  ""Spoiled union workers"" sounds a little harsh. It sounds a little like clawing at someone who has managed to gain a good living and drag them down to that oh-so-desirable subsistence level. Can't there be some good-paying jobs in this country, even if we ourselves don't have them, without calling the workers undeserving?"
348706,bullybass,2009-06-05 17:32:00,144,"I never understand the disdain that people have towards these unionized employees and their ""above average wages"".  I have seen so many times that the labour costs associated with cars produced to be around 7-10% of the cost of said car. Do you really think that if the union decided that they would take a huge pay cut that the consumer would see any benefit to this. The fat cat upper management would just end up sucking this saving in via enormous bonuses... likely associated with getting the union to take the cut in the first place. Would the cost of the cars go down because of this? I don't think so. The only thing that is going to make the cost go down is competition with all the other companies out there... along with desperation with the current situation. Just my 2 cents but last time I checked houses still cost on average $200,000 + for anything decent. How does one afford that working for $12/hr at a manufacturing facility where things like pension and safety take a back seat to the owner getting rich? Not to mention having to pay the $100+/month for any health benefits... ever been to the dentist without benefits... not to mention going with your whole family!!! bullybass"
348774,ch312,2009-06-05 22:01:00,1590," it would sound better if GM got $0. it doesnt matter to me is GM screwed over its workers or not. why should the money i worked hard for go to these people? exactly, it shouldnt. if the company i work for goes teats up tomorrow, would you be happy if your tax dollars were handed to me?  im all for people making good money and a lot of people deserve more money than they make. everyone who relies on a company pension should have enough brains to realize that the money they are counting on may not be there. what makes GM workers so special while others have lost their company pensions? the point you are missing here is our tax dollars are going to these pensioners when it could be used for education, healthcare, roads, etc. but instead it is going to pay for someones vacation to vegas while kids in school are denied computers because there is no money.  explain to me how that is right..."
348782,Jonny,2009-06-05 22:20:00,1380,"I`m all for letting a company go teats up if they mess up.  But the US gov`t and the Canadian gov`t decided that this just couldn`t be allowed to happen to GM. They had their reasons, and I don`t think it all had to do with being in big business`s pocket. Call me gullible, but I buy some of those reasons, much as I dislike seeing public money bail out private enterprise.  Kids in the classroom DO have computers, by the way. I know that first-hand, and you should see what they can do with the help of a good computer teacher. Things that most of us, even as adults, took years to learn, or never learned, just scratching the surface with internet, word pro, and email."
348883,ch312,2009-06-06 12:08:00,1590," im 23 so im part of the computer age  i went to a catholic school and that school board has a lot more money. many of my friends went to public high schools and they still cant believe how much better i had it in a catholic high school. there were enough mountain bikes, roller blades, skies, bow and arrows, tennis rackets, etc for 2 full classes. there were also great computer rooms.  now you look at all of the public high schools here in brantford, none of them have any of that equipment for gym class and the computers are junk. money like this would be much better for education"
348888,Moosebunk,2009-06-06 12:27:00,3970,"EVERYTHING ASIDE.  Companies should be responsible to themselves and their own... especially ones with millions and billions in assets.  The global economy upon which they feast or famine has seen highs and lows throughout the century and from the beginning of the auto industries time... it was, has and should always be their top priority to prepare themselves for changes in the tide.  The money they make and have made should have ensured this... regardless of Union, pension, work-force, administration and even product issues.  Their internal plans and actions didn't make the grade... so they fail.  And fail means... start over next year from the bottom and do it again to get it right... NOT, push 'em through to the next grade because ego is more important than foundation.  This ""me"" generation we somtimes talk of today does not just involve the children around us.  In 20-30-40 years time, the actions of the governments today will come back and bite many people in the buttocks.  And my bet is, it will happen over and over and over again... perpetuating the ideal that a failing grade is OK... someone will still give us an ""A"" and pull us through anyways.  Just my $0.02 before the morning cup."
348897,Jonny,2009-06-06 13:16:00,1380,"Yes, Catholic high schools have more money from the general tax pool than public schools. In Northern Ontario with the extra French grants some of them have a lot more.  Yet in the public schools I am familiar with, they're doing fine. In one particular middle school the computer lab gets new computers every 2 or 3 years, there's a dedicated computer teacher and you'd be amazed what Grade 7's and 8's can do - they can navigate Excel spreadsheets, turn out polished Power Point presentations, etc. etc. All places are not the same - it depends on the local base and the allocation of resources.  But back to car manufacture and the basic question... The federal and Ontario governments had little choice but to ante up some bail-out money after the US government did so. You might note that the German government threw money at the problem too, afraid to let its auto industry take a big hit.  Again, I am not happy about tax money going to corporations, but I can't see that there was much choice in Canada once the American government committed to that course. A lot of people feel that it was necessary, and the better of two unpleasant choices."

349444,mikeh,2009-06-08 00:53:00,824,Does anybody know where the US or Canada is going to come up with this money initially?   . From what I understand the Federal Reserve in the US is owned by private companies and I think the US has to borrow the money from the Federal Reserve.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.
349545,Chris,2009-06-08 10:46:00,405,"Anyone notice that every year there is new crisis that the gov't. of the day lays on us. A few years ago the crisis was our health care system. Dalton taxed us to the tune of $600/year and wait times didn't get any shorter, in fact they increased. You don't hear much about health care anymore. Then it was west nile virus. Studies, task forces, etc. the bills added up. What happened to that? No word about west nile deaths anywhere anymore. Then it was the millions and millions for the SARS outbreak. Has SARS been eliminated? You never hear about it anymore. Then it was the immenent threat of a pandemic, that never happened. A lot of taxpayer money went into so-called preventative measures. The yearly flu shots allow doctors to charge a flat fee to taxpayers for each shot given, yet the shot are only good for flus that already happened, not any new pandemic. You don't hear much about that anymore, except that they still want you to get flu shots every year. Now it's the global economy. My guess is after they bilk us for billions more things will carry on as normal, as they usually do. Except that over 10 billion dollars has been removed from the taxpayer wealth base.  All of these crisis' cost taxpayers dearly. I read once that were a few ways that gov't. control the masses. One is to preoccupy our minds through the age old ""divide and conquer"" routine which is played out at each election. Actually the three major parties policies differ very little in the grand sceme of things, but there we are at election time, fighting for ""our"" party and calling the other side names like children in a sand box (actually children are better behaved....). The other is through fear. They know people will cough up money when threatened with a crisis. I predict it will take a while for the masses to come around, it always does. But eventually, living in the age of technical communications, people will wise up to gov't and start to react. All these crisis' are govt made. Yeah there's always some basis of truth to them, but you know how the media (the govt's lap dog) blows everything out of proportion.  My rant for Monday morning."
349581,holdfast,2009-06-08 12:50:00,1813,"The Environment Tax grab.  Lets see, I goes to Walmart and Buys a TV plus environmental Fees.

349582,Jonny,2009-06-08 12:51:00,1380,"Don't get me started on the ways our system doesn't work. But it's the best we've got. I think human nature prevents us from getting anything better.  People are just too happy to think that a Stanley Cup playoff game is important. They're too happy doing their own little thing. They're too preoccupied with their own lives. They're too prone to carp to a circle of friends and co-workers and leave it at that. They're too complacent. They're too apathetic. They're too insular and opinionated. They're too gullible. They're too happy to let others do the work and take the responsibility unless they screw up bigtime. They're too eager to jump on bandwagons, and then jump off them again, thinking they have made a difference.  Big government and big business know how to play on those things. And people who rise into the ranks of those who have the power to make a difference forget where they came from and become part of a circle of entitlement as long as they have that short memory. They lose their honesty and integrity because they see what politics and knowing the right people can get them.  Latest case in point - that woman who was CEO of ""eHealth Ontario"" (whatever the hell that is) - feather-bedding, corrupt, and now kicked out because she was too stupid about it, and now eligible for a severance package (despite the fact that she was caught red-handed with her fingers in the cookie jar) to the tune of some $300,000+ !!!  Now that paints a pretty black picture. We do have honest people with integrity, and we do have enough openness to catch the dumbest and or greediest criminals. We do have a media that can be effective in exposing things. But I get the feeling that we just see the tip of the iceberg, maybe just enough to feel that the system really does work well enough, while underneath that, in the big picture,  things are being arranged to benefit people who stay as invisible as they can.  My Monday morning rant."
349682,Chris,2009-06-08 17:17:00,405," Thanks HF, I forgot about that one!  Well said JPJ"
347986,Dusky,2009-06-03 21:02:00,310,"Yes he had a choice but he does not have the courage to go that route.  Your argument that they can pull other business, well they are already eliminating Canadian businesses by including “Buy American” clause in stimulus package. Also, if history teaches us anything, they don’t care about Canadian interest e.g. lumber war, rejection of Canadian beef and so on… so we as Canadian need to stand up to safe guard our own interest. Question is, is it our interest to bailout GM?  Secondly, if other auto manufactures go for bankruptcies down the road, are we going to bail them out as well? E.g. Honda has a very big operation in Canada, if they go bankrupt and Japanese government decide to bail them out, are we going to chip in our share there as well just because of the fear that other Japanese companies can pull their operation out from Canada?  In capitalist economy businesses work to make money. If they are not making money, they simply vanish, GM is not going to be the first one. As long as it’s viable for Coca Cola or any other company per say to do manufacturing in Canada, no government can make them move their operations.  I think right now he is doing all it takes to please Obama administration, as conservative started with him on a bad note during the US democratic primaries where they leak some conversation to please Hilary. Now conservative government and Canadian taxpayers are paying the price for stupid move conservatives made not so long ago."
347989,bbog,2009-06-03 21:28:00,665,Did he have a choice? Yes Did he follow voter sentiment? No Would the US start a war if we turned off the oil tap? ABSOLUTELY!!  The second GM US has any future difficulty you can bet the pain will be experienced in Canada. The dumbest thing you can do is pump money into an entity outside of your control or jurisdiction. Kiss your money goodbye and all the good things it could have done if our Government had a backbone.
348071,Jonny,2009-06-04 00:54:00,1380,"Like Bushart said above, a LOT more depends on GM Canada's survival than just the plant workers.  Did Harper have a choice? No.  Did he do the right thing? In the circumstances, yes.  Hell, the Liberals have forced us to waste (so far) about $2 BN on a useless gun registry. Where did that get us? This at least is money that should have some tangible result. And it's a ""loan"" (granted not likely to be re-paid) but we now will OWN about 12% of GM. Assuming that the company changes course and survives (and I think it will... there are already steps committed to), and now that it's out from under the crushing burden of high labour and benefit costs, we'll be owning an asset that's worth something.  We can't sit around while viable companies  pull out of the country (and GM is still viable, to think otherwise is probably kidding yourself), and hope that Frank Stronach's Magna dreams come true. Did you know that the Opel deal isn't even final? The German gov't says they're still open to a better offer until September, and Italy's Berlusconi has said he would support another Fiat bid for Opel.  I feel for Sudbury nickel workers. I was one once myself, and my father spent most of his adult life working for INCO. We need to pull out of this world-wide recession before the demand for nickel will go back up. In the meantime it would be a good idea to keep companies in Canada that use nickel."

Remember when there was a problem with the Cattle Industry.  That is big Business out West and affected a lot more than employment.  It affected the Livelihood of Hard working Westerner Canadians who cattled for Generations.  If you compare the two, the Stimulus package should of went to the Cattlemen.

That guy who mentioned pensioners ""being on vacation"" is talking total nonsense.  They're retired.  What does vacation have to do with being pensioned off?  I can only assume whoever said that has less than 5 years service with whoever he works for now.  Maybe I'm wrong.  If so, I apolagize in advance.  You put in 25 or 30 years loyal service (to a company that made buckets of money for 28 of those years) with certain promises made to you, see them evaporate and we'll see how quick you change your tune.  I'm really sorry to whom I possibly offend, but I can't help but think that begrudging retiries is a little shameful.

They didn't get what they got for nothing... and don't forget, they contributed a lot of their own earnings too.  I'm retired, but for the 32 years of my career, I contributed roughly 10% of my salary every year.

He'll be gone when we vote him out and then we'll vote in a new puppet to lay all the blame on, all the while feeling proud that we made a difference.....meanwhile big business will still be here dictating what goes on. IMHO Canadians should give the middle finger to GM and drive the final nail in the coffin. They just ripped us off for a million dollars 10,500 times.  Please don't ask me to feel sorry for auto workers. Their union leaders pushed for wages that were substantially higher than the status quo for assembly line workers and the workers bought into it thinking that GM's coffers were a bottomless pit of cash. They backed their union and made their own bed for themselves. When will people understand that the pot isn't endless just because you have a strong union?  Why not let them fold and let the viable auto makers enjoy picking up the slack. What's wrong with that? Isn't that how the capitalism that these big businesses subscribe to works?? I guess they only want to play that game when it works in their favour.  This whole thing is just another govt. backed smokescreen with plenty of mirrors to scam the taxpayer out of more of their money. Things like this have been going on for years......ever notice how every 7 to 10  years or so the gov't and big business ""creates"" a recession to beat us back down. They let us get ahead, get ahead, get ahead, and then bam....recession....let's peel back some of the equity that taxpayers have been creating for themselves. I've been watching it go on for the past 35 years. Anybody that thinks this is wise use of our taxpayer's dollars is part of the problem.

It's their own fault they are in the situation, so why the heck should WE pay for their mistakes??!?!    HAHA!"
348295,Fishnwire,2009-06-04 15:28:00,983," I guess you've never belonged to a union.  If you had, you'd realize that the average union member has about as much power in what decisions their leaders make as you and I do in what decisions Harper makes.  It's entirely impossible for a rank and file union member to make any change to union policy without an overwhelming majority of support from the rest of the workers.  Expecting the membership to ask for and vote in lower wages is like asking the Canadian people to ask for higher taxes.  Do you actually think that it's Joe Lunchbox's fault because he never decided on his own that the money he and his neighbours were paid (from one of the world's biggest and most profitable corporations) was too generous?  Is that normally how human nature works?  I bet most of us feel that we deserve every penny we earn, some of us may even have days when we think we're underpaid.  I read somwhere that upper level CEOs can expect to be compensated at a rate of around 1000 times what the average production worker earns...and they're the ones who were at the helm when the company ran aground.  One of those plants they shut down won awards year after year for producing the best quality vehicles, so we know the production workers were doing their jobs extremely well.  After you're done blaming Canadian workers for the the state of the economy, let's blame Canadian soldiers for the how bad it is in Afghanistan.   On this point, I could not agree with you more.  Big business is forever lamenting that the government constrains the free market.  They claim to want smaller, ""hands-off"" government.  To be able to operate without all those pesky hang-ups, like minimum wage, environmental controls, health and safety regulations, etc, etc.  But hold on!  They'll take the tax breaks, the subsidies, the governmental assistance and ""stimulus"" packages.  They didn't hesitate to run to mommy when they screwed up royally.  And the real kick in the pants is this; Every one of these guys is still living in a mansion and driving a Bentley."
348351,Jonny,2009-06-04 17:52:00,1380,"Well put, Fishnwire.  ---  One thing for everyone to keep in mind is that industrial jobs are hard to come by, and there's a multiplier effect... every industrial job spins off many jobs in other industries and in the service sector. So you're not talking, say, 10K jobs at GM, you're talking a whole lot more (i.e. like those car haulers mentioned above). The impact of losing whole factories (for good!) would be devastating in the short term and hard to overcome in the long term.  I wouldn't expect Frank Stronach to come riding to the rescue just yet by buying moth-balled factories."
348355,Troit,2009-06-04 18:04:00,19,"1st there are thouseands of people out of work, im sure if GM even went beyound the wages and went as low as 12$ a hr, nobody would be complaining about it, besides employes themselves, im sure lots of money would be saved and GM wouldnt be sqaucking about losing money....  Get this over with and ill hand in my resume"
348372,misfish,2009-06-04 19:13:00,29133,"On a positive note,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,    WERE BACK TO 5 DAYS AND RUNNING AT 90% CAPACITY.   That move by Volkswagon to North America and Crysler getting back on line sooner then many thought,has just put us back on track again.  As for GM,we made a part for the Hummer,but just one.LOL"
348380,Chris,2009-06-04 19:29:00,405," Do the members not vote in their executive? Doesn't each member have a vote at strike time?   I don't think anybody disagrees that auto workers have one helluva nice compensation package compared to other manufacturing jobs. Maybe they wouldn't be asked to give up so much if they hadn't been so greedy in the first place. They are assembly line workers, not lawyers.   If it's one of the world's biggest and most profitable corporations then why are we even having this conversation?   Please don't put words in other people's mouths."
348402,POLLIWOGG,2009-06-04 20:29:00,835,A couple million would have kept the local hospital open ......sigh....
347508,holdfast,2009-06-02 22:23:00,1813,"This is a hard one.  The Candy-man (Obama) puts in Billions into GM an American Company.  Harper says he has no choice.  If he doesnt there will definately be closures in Canada to the USA.  For good reason I may add. Also if he doesn't it could lead to other repercussions.  When you look at the big picture, what he put into GM was Aproximately $400,000 per working Canadian GM worker.  As a side note, there were more layoffs in the Gas and Oil industry in Canada than the Auto Industry.  Question, Was he right putting in the 10.5 Billion on Behalf of Canada."
347511,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-02 22:27:00,0,since when has Harper been right with anything................
347513,siwash,2009-06-02 22:31:00,683,"Well, if you're a fan of socialism, he was right... if this proves anything it shows that government is actually controlled by greater forces... unions and welfare capitalist conspired to see that their interests were served...  How can you bail out a floundering company that has been spinning its wheel since the 1990's be justified? It would have made more senses to let it sink and pay out EI for an extended period..."
347515,Stoty,2009-06-02 22:33:00,2910,"No way!  Why is GM different than anyone else?? They made their own bed, and are complaining about sleeping in it now. Sure they are big..employ a lot of people...blah blah blah...but I know A LOT of people who have lost their jobs due to companies folding, but the government doesn't give a rats bum about them/us.  I realize this ISN'T the fault of the employees, but they aren't helping matters either. Take your pay cut, and make $19/hr. You've been spoiled long enough. Plus...you're still making more than MOST Canadians. Heck...at least you'll still have a job! I have 2 degrees, which is 2 more than 99% of GM employees...and I cant find work!  This whole thing is just sickening."
347519,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-02 22:42:00,10439,"Here's a question, Where the heck is going to find 10 billion dollars to give GM?? Instead of giving away money we don't have try paying down our debt instead."
347523,outllaw,2009-06-02 22:46:00,1232,on the short end folks say no. on the long term it will help. . showing all manufactures canada is open for business is whats needed.
347524,danbouck,2009-06-02 22:47:00,4380,I rather they do that than sit back and say it is what it is
347529,holdfast,2009-06-02 22:53:00,1813,"You Guys are missing my point completely.  The USA is Obviously doing their share, and putting their share into the Company.  Its a done Deal.  If Harper Doesnt, Dont Kid yourself, the USA will pull every GM Plant out of Canada.  Yup and they are good at other things as Payback.  Maybe Ford plants, CocaCola etc, Etc  How about this then, Did he have a Choice, Was it the right choice? under the circumstances  Lets not try to make this an election issue, as others also want to Spend, Spend."
347533,jediangler,2009-06-02 22:58:00,1923,"Won't matter anyway, they are still going to go under. Quality will now go down due to workers wages being cut and senior workers will have to do jobs previously done by younger workers so injuries will go up. All that money didn't help my job in the auto industry. Lowest seniority worker at my old plant started there in 1979."
347546,POLLIWOGG,2009-06-02 23:40:00,835,"They are already paying the senior guys to stay home so a new guy can do the job cheaper.  Like the accountant up the road said why should I pay for a GM workers divorce lawyer when I buy a car.  They should have spent the money backing new technology, or just split the money up between laid off auto sector workers, at least that way the money stays in Ca.  This will be a going away gift to GM."
347547,Cookslav,2009-06-02 23:42:00,1457," Tough question, but a good one..... I'd be inclined to say politicaly speaking he did not have much of a choice. Damage to our trade relationship would not help our soaring dollar, or do much good for any spin off industry that is only now stabalizing, and adjusting to the new Cut back levels of commerce in the market.  Also, The opposition parties are pushing it as well, so it then becomes fuel in the election proccess, and is another area to be poked at by the other parties.  So no... I don't think he had a choice. But regardless I don't think its the right decision for the long term. Let the peices fall, and re-build on solid ground...this patch work bull pucky is the equivelent of fixing the Titanic with silicone and duct tape."
347553,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-02 23:57:00,947,And now GM has sold Hummer to China.  Great they can start to build there Army woot woot
347559,tschirk,2009-06-03 00:09:00,261,"The real concern I have now that they are getting my hard tax dollars (against my wishes), how do we get it back? Who in their right mind is going to buy a GM vehicle when you know their demise is inevitable and getting parts & service is only going to worse and more expensive...sure buy Canadian but from someone that at least has a future. And don't get me started on the $3,000,000,000 for their pension when most Canadians don't even have one!  They should have liquidated and let a NEW company buy the assets and build Canadian cars that we WANT to buy. Free markets do work, socialism sucks..."
347588,bullybass,2009-06-03 01:19:00,144,With the American government holding a 60% share of the American company that controls GM Canada... how on earth would the American government let any jobs go to Canadians instead of Americans. Just my .02 cents but I think GM is going to be done in Canada by the end of 2010... other than trying to sell us cars.
347617,cram,2009-06-03 02:24:00,1733,"Its definitely a sour pickle.....but i'm not sure Harper had much of a choice.   Pretty substantial part of our economy (even if its shrinking).   New US president to start a relationship with (on a potentially very bad note).  PLus, to try to keep it afloat is going to cost WAY less than the pensions (that we're going to have to pick up on GMs behalf), so it was a risk worth taking (however small the likelihood of success)."
347620,Greencoachdog,2009-06-03 02:27:00,8163,Blah Blah woof woof!  ... what're you going to do aboot it???  Go buy a 2010 Camaro... you'll score some leg with that thing for sure!!!
347687,Chris,2009-06-03 10:09:00,405,Up until now I thought we really had something good going in Canada. Too bad Harper's Conservatives turned out to be just another bunch of bottom feeding puppets. Disgusting on two counts. Throwing away our tax dollars to a bankrupt company and supoporting the provincial idiots with their harmonized tax grab. Too bad voting won't change a thing.  They may be able to force us to give money to GM but they can't make us buy their junk....at least not yet.....nothing is beyond these scumbags.  
347712,bushart,2009-06-03 11:55:00,2628,This is a tough one cause it's not just GM it's the parts---the tires--the dealers--the steel ind etc.  Frank Stronach was in Ottawa yesterday showing his electric car ready to be mass produced in 3 years---my opinion those billions maybe should have went Magna's way cause he's thinking about a MADE IN CANADA electric automobile.  Those GM workers could maybe work there.  Bailing out GM is the path of least resistance (believe it or not)--the Gov't does'nt have to think....new technology etc.  It remains in office as angry laid off employees look elsewhere.--Not sure the forestry workers are thinking conservative now.---or the lobster fishermen--or the Sudbury miners or the steel workers or so on and so on...  Finally--regarding investing in alternative fuels---the world is very much still driven on oil-----These companies have'nt invested trillions to be left on the sideline---GM helped them along for years.  Bushart
347719,12footspringbok,2009-06-03 12:11:00,459,Bad economics all around. Things like this are going to make this recession that much longer and painful. Oh did anyone read the article about two weeks ago on how part of GM's restructuring plans involves importing cars from China starting in 2011?
347723,splashhopper,2009-06-03 12:19:00,2931,"  and about that pension i  just signed up to pay for the GM employees... NOT!  what incentive is there, now, for other large corporations to keep paying in to the pension funds?  NONE...  they dont have to worrry because you and I just lowered their over head and they KNOW the government of the day "" won't have a choice"" but to pony up, yet again !"
347746,Headhunter,2009-06-03 12:55:00,5703,"Not at all happy about this. My biggest question is why did they decide that GM warranted bail out over other industries devestated by the ecomomic slow down. 800,000 people in the forrestry industry are out of work. How many oil workers... I would have let them slide. I agree with an earlier poster in that Magna has a plan for CANADIAN growth and our money should have been ear marked for them, but, lobby groups have way more power than individuals.  I had high hopes for Harper when he took power, but at this point, he appears to be no different than any other politician covering their HH  Man, we must be in trouble as a country... I find myself agreeing with Stoty! That's it, dogs and cats living togther in harmony... ARMAGEDDON I tell you... ARMAGEDDON!"
347752,holdfast,2009-06-03 12:59:00,1813," How does that answer my Question.  Let me ask you then.   So You think Harper who Represents Canada should of not put one cent into the Company, while the Americans put 30 Billion Plus.  What if!!!!    GM gets back on their feet as a smaller Company owned by whoever.  Does that give them the Right or incentive to set up shop in Canada.  What if they said No way Canada.  What keeps Ford here.  Then again we can always say to the USA, you pull out your Industry here, we will sell you no Oil.  So Question is.  DID He have a choice and was it the right one?  I say he had no Choice as the American Government set the tone by Stimulating it on their behalf like it or not.  We can now call it Government Motors.  By the way.  Mr Obama is dictating how a car will be made, so I'm Giving Government Motors low odds on making money as we all know, the government has a way of not making, but sinking money into anything."
347811,Fishnwire,2009-06-03 15:05:00,983,"Did Harper have a choice?  Not really.  When has the Canadian government, particularily one headed by Conservatives, done anything other than bend over and take it from the Americans?  We've seen that when it comes by ""bi-laterial"" agreements between the two, such as free-trade, that the more powerful of the two nations gets to enjoy all the rights while rarely having to maintain their responsibilities.  We're like a fly on an elephant...they can do whatever they want and we have no recourse.  They have methods of exerting pressure in countless ways.  Can you say, ""snowball effect""?  A matter for another thread?  Maybe, but it is relevant here.  Just like depolyment of our military resourses, Ottawa never has to think too hard, the decission has already been made for them by Washington.  That said, it probably won't work in the long-run.  GM is doomed it seems...maybe they should have been allowed to die a natural death like a lot of other businesses are doing right now.  Monday was the first day of my eight week ""temporary"" lay-off from the mine here in Sudbury.  I'm one of the lucky ones...I will hopefully have a job to go back to.  There are lots of guys in town who are on permanent layoff.  Where's their bail-out?  Part of the reason our government possibly should be on the hook for the pensions is because they allowed GM to raid that (previously) seperately held pension fund years ago.  It's another example of how a previous government made a mistake which we are now all forced to deal with.  Whoever it was who had the bright idea to lay a finger on the money in the first place should have his hands chopped off.  As far as the workers taking massive paycuts to retain their jobs...why bother spending billions of dollars to save a bunch of mediocre jobs?  I'd rather know that if we are going down this road, at least my tax dollars are supporting jobs that actually drive the economy, not just pay enough for people to get by.  A lot of folks seem to think that whatever group of working people they don't belong to should ""Get used to the idea of making less money.""  That's the wrong attitude.  Our fathers and grandfathers worked and fought to establish the standard of living we enjoy...I don't want to be in a position where I have to tell my kids about the good ol' days when we only had to work 40 hours a week, could refuse unsafe work and had something called ""minimum wage.""  None of us should be too eager to see our neighbour take a huge step back...if it's him today it that much more likely it will be you tomorrow."
347853,POLLIWOGG,2009-06-03 17:06:00,835,"To cut the sale of oil to the US is considered by them as an act of war, do you think we can take them?"
347983,LeXXington,2009-06-03 20:57:00,1928,"He had a choice just not a politically viable one.. Says tough to Ontario and GM leaves lots of people out of work short term pain. not voted in.. Goes along with the US better relations let GM die a slow death can say at least he tried.  There a are a couple things here, Will the new GM make better cars? How long before the union starts stiking again.. Thing about goverment unions is there is always more money out there. Name one goverment run industry that is not reaping us for high wages cause they can.  Oh welll, goverment knows best and listen to the people the leasts."
