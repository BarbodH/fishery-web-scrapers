Where the hell are all the dam fish!?! I was a guest there last Saturday and I tried almost every lure in my box/ bag and didnt even get a nibble. The area is by port Keeywaydin. Any tips for the next time I go up there would be greatly appreciated."
348626,johnnyb,2009-06-05 12:40:00,3413,"I don't know the lake that well, but, I've heard some excellent reports.  If you're not too far from the mouth of the Muskoka River, head over there."
348817,Rizzo,2009-06-06 01:05:00,4754,lots of pike in gravenhurst bay. Any time I went there we just fished it
348904,majorlifts,2009-06-06 13:31:00,171,"I heard reports that there are Trout AND Walleye, is this so, and how can that be. I have been fishing since I was a young boy and still have not learn to figure out the difference between Isotropic and mesotrophic. This would  probably help huge. But its not a text book def, its the actual look of the lake to determine what kind it is that troubles me.  Wow!! Fishing can be deep, (pardon the pun)"
348924,steverowbotham,2009-06-06 15:10:00,1800,"there are trout and walleye, as there are in many lakes.  What species are yu wanting to catch?  I can certainly get you started"
348946,majorlifts,2009-06-06 18:32:00,171,"Walleye would be a great start because I have more gear for that, but Bass will be opening up last Sat of June and Im sure theres Bass in that lake too. I tried trolling for eyes but that lake is crazy deep, in some spots its 120 ft deep."
348947,johnnyb,2009-06-06 18:48:00,3413,"My Dad would always brag about great bass fishing on Lake Muskoka...the only way he'd fish was at night, off any rock point, with a full moon and a jitterbug.  Real slow stop-start retrieve...and he proved that it's still effective by schooling me last summer on a nice calm moonlit night.     Lots of bass in those big muskoka lakes..."
348959,JohnF,2009-06-06 19:51:00,3494,  I remember there were always a few hanging under the swimrafts at any of the cottages we used.  JF
349159,lunkerbasshunter,2009-06-07 13:04:00,2585,i worked on lake muskoka about 15 years ago for a summer.  there are big pike at the mouth of the river.  also lots of bass around the island shores.  we used to catch walleye on the wind sweeped shore lines on browning island.  this was 15 years ago though.  cheers!
