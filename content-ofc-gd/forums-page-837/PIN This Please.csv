349407,brifishrgy,2009-06-07 23:11:00,559,Probably have a better chance at getting something pinned if you used the OFC albums instead of image shack of Photobucket.. IMO
349413,Greencoachdog,2009-06-07 23:25:00,8163,"Did you just figure out how to post pics or what Henry???  ... or maybe you're tired of clicking on links to pics eh?  Photobucket is even easier than ImageShack, all the really kool kids are using Photobucket... and it's light years ahead of the OFC Gallery (sorry to say), with all the pic resizing you have to do to load your pics on this boards Gallery... it just aint worth it, you do all that work to get a itty bitty rinky dink chickensquat pic posted... I would really like to see a MAJOR upgrade to our Gallery!"
349473,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-08 01:56:00,947, Right    I sure did just learned how  yea but Then you have to open an account with Photobucket and go through all the steps.  It's just a quick way to post a picture if they wanted to for a report or something interesting they want to tell everyone real quick
