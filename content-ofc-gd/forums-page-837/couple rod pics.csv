349453,Rodwrap,2009-06-08 01:12:00,130,"for 2 summers, about 5-6years ago  -I'd pour bird seed on the deck while that bear ran her nose up my arm like a dog would. She'd set in the backyard all afternoon with us. I even ran a planer, table saw, etc. when I built our kitchen ...didn't bother her.  (She'd eat all kinds of stuff EXCEPT HOT DOGS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! cooked...nope !!)  Kinda interesting...that bear ( the one in front) I named Billy Bear... is tagged & tracked by the PA Game Commission...she's now 10 years old ( by there study)..she hibernates in an area about 25 miles from my house ( known as the Hickory Wilderness Area), She is smart enough to get in her cave a week or so BEFORE bear season...  She's still around, but, Last year I got a dog that chases her up over the hill...so ,this year, she comes at night...tears up the bird feeders.."
