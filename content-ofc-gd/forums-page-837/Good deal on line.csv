349133,Cudz,2009-06-07 11:27:00,2652,I got 2 packs of Spiderwire EZ braid for $14.99 yesterday at Canadian Tire. That is less than half price.  Only drawback is that they come in a 2 pack and they have to be the same pound test.
349289,GBW,2009-06-07 18:56:00,8460,how is that line?  I use the spiderwire stealth and like it a lot but 2 packs for $15 I might have to go get some if it's good too.  anyone use this line?
349294,dnb_cbr,2009-06-07 19:07:00,61,"I tried it last year.  It's not very round.  It was ok on a baitcaster, but not so great on a spinning reel.  Its not as immune to twist as other, rounder braids."
349301,Cudz,2009-06-07 19:15:00,2652,I just respooled one of my baitcasters with it.  Replaced the fireline I had on it.  I will let you know.
349302,GBW,2009-06-07 19:15:00,8460,"thanks, as I was going to get this for backup link for my spinning gear."
349305,GBW,2009-06-07 19:18:00,8460,thanks.  I'm still getting the hang of baitcasters so it was going to be for my spinning gear. maybe I should get it and use it for my daughters spincast?  it would last for years the amount she fishes...
349331,bigpikemike,2009-06-07 20:12:00,52,i found the 14lb amazing on my spinning gear....didnt like it too much on my baitcasters...my gf only uses fireline and shes been out fishin me lately
349337,pike slayer,2009-06-07 20:37:00,1177,i put that spiderwire ez braid on a spinning rod/reel of mine and after the first time out it frayed like crazy and i didnt trust it and took it off. i dont think i'd buy it again and just go with the ultracast when it goes on sale for $20 a spool at crappy.
349352,Jonny,2009-06-07 21:13:00,1380,"I've avoided Spiderwire ever since spooling it onto one of my spinning reels. It wasn't a braided line (like Gorilla Braid) but more like one continuous greenish filament, so maybe the braid is different. But I found that on my reel the stuff I had would slip in underneath itself, bind a little, and make coming off the spool not smooth at all.  I've tried Gorilla braid and it doesn't have the binding problem, but I find that it must have extra water resistance because my trolls don't seem to go as deep.  The best choicce for me still seems to be plain old monofilament - i.e. Berkeley Trilene, Shakespeare Sigma."
