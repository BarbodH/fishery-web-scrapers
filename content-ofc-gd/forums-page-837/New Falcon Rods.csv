348719,vertigo,2009-06-05 18:29:00,37,"Hi All, I'm looking at picking up some of the new Falcon Bucoo rods. I can only find them in the States in limited stores. Does anyone know much about them? I read things online, but they are so new to the market that simple info such as the taper is not out yet.  I was also considering the MoJo's but the colour is really putting me off. Is anyone planning on ordering a Bucoo or have one and can give me a review on it or on Falcon rods in general.  Is there a Falcon rod dealer in the GTA?  Thanks. Nelson"
348741,BillM,2009-06-05 19:43:00,17367,Never heard of them before.
348800,vertigo,2009-06-05 23:46:00,37,They came out about 3 days ago. I'm thinking of ordering them from Monster Tackle on the ast coast. Shipping rates are incredible! $10 for one pice 7 foot rods! They even combine shipping on rods.
348802,Cudz,2009-06-05 23:55:00,2652,Falcon are good rods but I have not seen them for sale in Canada.  I am sure someone must sell them though
348923,vertigo,2009-06-06 15:09:00,37,Too bad. I wonder what the closest place to the border?
348955,EC1,2009-06-06 19:36:00,930,"probably best to wait unless you're willing to gamble with your money. Wait until someone has a review of it somewhere and then you'll know whether you should get it or not.  Your other option is the Mojo Bass rods from St. Croix right?  If you're in a rush to get a rod, get the mojo then, or you can gamble 100 bucks for the new bucoo.  To be honest with you though, the bucoo does look really nice from pictures.  I don't know how long that clean/matte look will last because of the EVA foam, and my Damiki rod with EVA foam has turned slightly smooth and glossy after about 2 months of use...about 20 days of fishing or so."
349003,Rodwrap,2009-06-06 22:48:00,130,"A little dish soap & scrub pad will bring the EVA back to new.  Falcons have been around...possibly, like loomis, under several different owners...a little research is required here..  Loomis....once the Caddilac, & strongly supported by the custom builders, now will discontinue blank mfg. 12/31...."
