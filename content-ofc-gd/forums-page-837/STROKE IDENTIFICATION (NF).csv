She assured everyone that she was fine (They offered to call paramedics). She said she had just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes.  They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food. While she appeared a bit shaken up, Ingrid went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening.  Ingrid's husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital. At 6:00 pm Ingrid passed away. She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ.. Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke, perhaps Ingrid would be with us today. Some don't die. They end up in a helpless, hopeless condition instead.  It only takes a minute to read this...  A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke...totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough.  RECOGNIZING A STROKE:  Thank God for the sense to remember the '3' steps, STR . Read and Learn!  Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify.. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.  Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions:  S *Ask the individual to SMILE. T *Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE, coherently. (i.e. It is sunny out today.) R *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.  If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call emergency number immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.  New Sign of a Stroke -------- Stick out Your Tongue  NOTE: Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out his tongue... If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other, that is also an indication of a stroke.  Thanks"
349196,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-07 14:08:00,0,Know the signs well........Its a 'time matter' once you know. Being diagnosed in under 3 hours means a life.....or not.
349213,Joey,2009-06-07 15:22:00,9122,"Good thread.  I know the signs well too, and when my mother was having her stroke (which she thought was just the flu) I asked her to smile.   When only one side of her mouth went up, I called 9-1-1.  She is alive and well today and fully recouperated.  Joey"

349534,Woodsman,2009-06-08 07:32:00,1286,"As a first aid & cpr instructor I can add to this thread. Some more signs & symptoms. Facial droop - one side of the face doesn't move as well as the other. Complains of weakness - sudden weakness,numbness or tingling in face, arm or leg. Vision problems - sudden loss, particularly in one eye or double vision. Headache - sudden severe & unusual. Decreased level of consciousness - mental confusion. Loss of bladder control. Dizziness - sudden loss of balance, especially with any of the above symptoms. Unequal size of pupils - indicates some form of brain injury. Caution - unequal pupils are normal for some people. As for raising the arms - Have them raise both arms together to the straight to the side level with the shoulders. If they can't do this or one arm drifts down this is a sign. This statement is a little overstated. If the stroke is severe enough death may result quickly. Less severe stokes can cause some brain damage effecting certain bodily functions depending on what part of the brain is effected. There are 2 causes of strokes, a blood clot blocks a narrowed artery in the brain depriving the brain of oxygen beyond this point. This is the most common cause of stroke and damage can reversed or at least reduced with prompt treatment. A ruptured artery in the brain can also cause a stroke. These strokes tend not to respond to treatment as well.  Rick"
