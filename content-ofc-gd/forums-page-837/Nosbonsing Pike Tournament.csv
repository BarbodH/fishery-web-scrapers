Total $120 per person. I will cover the gas this time. I have a 17' with a 115HP Opti and I am totally set up for this thing. Let me know ASAP. I am in a bad spot here. I live in the area and know the lake fairly well. So if anybody is interested, I may consider a more formal partnership for more tourneys."
