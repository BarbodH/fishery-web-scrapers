I went back up that way last week and ordered by phone 15 minutes out of Gooderham and it was ready when I got there. This place is a gotta try. Google it and see his menu. Two thumbs up. I was gonna make a trip near the area, and in Google maps, this place came up....soooo, being a bbq lover, I said I had to try it. Anyhow, plans changed, I didn't end up that way, but after seeing this testimonial, I think a road trip is in order. My lips are already puckering......"

It is located at the southern end of 12 mile Lake where it meets Mountain Lake. It is a little summer BBQ hut run by Gary. He smokes all his own BBQ. He also make his own rub, sauces and pickles. Don't take my word for it stop in if you are ever in the area."

It did strike me as a ""Cheers"" kinda place, everyone knew one-another but man the food was top shelf. This is going to come across as heresy to some but English style Fish & Chips at a Greek restaurant that puts most ""English"" places to shame, best fish & chips I've had in many a moon.
