Just managed to miss a porcupine, and thankfully some farmers old dog that crossed the road. But the third encounter was nothing in my wildest thoughts.  What the hell is he/she, doing standing in the middle of the road at 4:15 AM.      It did fly off after I honked the horn.  I was laughing my ass off. "
978018,Terry,2016-07-29 17:35:00,14456,the road was giving you the bird
978020,Rodbender,2016-07-29 17:47:00,1027,LOL probably this years young one thought that the black was water or missed the roost tree  or daring you to cross the double yellow

Quite common to hear the Bittern calling at night and foraging, believe the Back Crowned Night Heron is also nocturnal judging from its name. Did the location border on some marsh or swampy area?"
978025,ketchenany,2016-07-29 18:30:00,3229,looks like  Heron B . Almost breakfast.

It is a heron and my observations from 2 years as Park Naturalist at Long Point Provincial Park that herons and Bitterns are quite vocal and forage at night as well ."

LOL i have to have a word with the kid my daughter baby sits I didn't write that And you are correct Herons have more rods and cones in their eye to see better at night"
