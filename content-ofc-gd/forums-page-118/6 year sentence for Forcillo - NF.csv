978072,muddler,2016-07-30 01:41:00,623,"I don't give a rat's patewy who it is. Murder is murder. I've said it before, ""OUR LEGAL SYSTEM SUCKS!"" big time.  There are too many psychos with a badge out there. They are the ones that ruin it for the decent cop that works hard and puts his/her life on the line to , ""serve and protect"" every day. We need regular psychiatric assessment before, during a cop's employment and especially after a traumatic service of duty. Lethal force MUST be the last resort in all situations not the first as it is in the US. Abuse of leathal force MUST result in a guilty verdict, and to heck with the legal mumbo jumbo. Murder is murder.  Cops have a very dangerous job, no doubt about it, but they choose to be a cop, no one forced them to become one.  My 2 cents .......Mud"
978073,woodenboater,2016-07-30 01:48:00,2277,Two things.  TPS have obviously not learned how to deal with people with mental health issues (see Edmond Yu)/  He was obviously not mentally fit to be an officer (imo) if he couldn't wait for a commanding officer to arrive with the taser and no other officer seemed particularly concerned such as he was and one officer in fact holstered her service revolver.  He should NEVER wear a badge ever again. He's not even fit to be a mall cop.
978092,BITEME,2016-07-30 13:59:00,1968,I want to say first I have a deep respect for police and the job they do!!!  That being said this turd was way out of line..... a kid on an empty bus with a small knife 2 cops with guns (where was the taser) and all the time in the world to keep him on the bus and wait for a dog anyway he was way out of line after the second shot not to mention the next 8 this guy should not be on the street his butt should be in a cell awaiting his appeal this is really bad optics and just plain wrong he should be banned for life from firearms and never be allowed to be a cop anywhere and before it happens his situation was secure and he was not in danger it was way over the line  put him in general I certainly don't want to pay for his special treatment turds should be flushed  my 2 cents Peter

I am not defending him, to be honest with you I think he crossed the line but: have you ever had one of those days when.........  We don't know what was going through either of their minds on that night. Yes we have a trained professional who in my opinion didn't follow what I would have expected his training to have dictated his course of action BUT, just because you have been trained doesn't mean you are qualified.  Accountability is sadly lacking in not only our police forces but in every walk of life. Our kids are taught that their parents will fix everything, our politicians lie to us all the time and then lie some more, the gang bangers shoot at each other then walk away with suspended sentences.

Seems weird the way the sentencing is termed  Plus how much consideration was given to the danger of the girls and the rest of the street car on his behalf (yatim brandishing a knife)  The charge does seem weird.  But the logic is that the cop didn't know that the first three shots were fatal.  Taking six shots at someone that he didn't know was already dead or dying was deemed to be attempted murder.  p.s. There were no other people on board at the time of the shooting.

978009,AKRISONER,2016-07-29 16:33:00,5558,"heres how i take it and im sure someone here is going to lose it on me but this is my opinion so whatever.  I am of the firm belief that we must all do what we can to avoid the dangers of criminals and the like around us.  Its really no different than someone complaining about being assaulted while walking alone through a bad neighborhood in the middle of the night. Ill make it clear, that no one and i mean absolutely nobody at all deserves to be murdered/shot or assaulted. People like to go on about victim blaming, but im a firm believer that we are all responsible for our own well being. If you really truly are an innocent victim i.e. jane creba or one of these mass shooting victims...i feel immense sadness for you...but if you become a victim of crime because you are a criminal, i have a lot less sympathy for you directly.  The kid clearly had some mental issues, by refusing to back down he placed himself in a very very precarious situation. It just so happened that he crossed the wrong guy that day and ended up paying the ultimate price for it. People die every day that do far less or are much better people than this guy. So do i feel really bad for the guy? Not particularly...maybe im cold hearted that way.  I do believe that this sentence is a joke though...the cop murdered him. The additional 6 shots while the guy is laying dead on the ground proves the intent. In the end i feel the worst for the victims parents, and for the murderers family cause both dont deserve the trauma that they are experiencing now."
978011,scuro2,2016-07-29 16:45:00,904,"6 years doesn't sound ridiculous. If we go on the principle that cops are trained to kill when threatened then the first three shots are apparently excusable under the law. Knowing that he most likely died from the first three shots the next 6 takes any doubt out of the equation. So probably dead but the excess shots would be the attempt to make sure he was dead...attempted murder. Was this guy given a job he should never have had, was he properly trained to deal with the mentally ill? There are mitigating circumstances. Considering everything the judgement is not perfect but one can live with it. He serves 2-3 years but his career and reputation is ruined."
