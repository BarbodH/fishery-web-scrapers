978053,Rizzo,2016-07-29 22:52:00,4754,"Was hoping to fish Lake O tomorrow launching under skyway bridge. Plan was to fish from 6 am to 9:30, but I see winds in the 15-20 k range out of the east. Since I have only fished Lake O twice not sure what effect this would have. I would think not great...hence my question. I am in a 16 8 foot alumacraft full windshield. For those who know these waters...is this suitable to go out in or best to keep the boat in the garage?"
978054,Tom McCutcheon,2016-07-29 22:58:00,627,"Personally, I would look for another eastern launch or inland water to fish. I used to run a 20' glass cuddy cabin with full windshield. Under those conditions, it will be extremely bumpy on the west end of the lake."
978055,Freshtrax,2016-07-29 23:04:00,2215,"I have a 22 ft glass boat kept in Hamilton, she is most likely not leaving the dock all weekend... I'd say 6-8 ft rollers by tomorrow"
978056,dave524,2016-07-29 23:09:00,4508,"Go to Erie, Port Colborne area and fish pickeral or bass, that was my option when the wind was out of the east."
978057,Joeytier,2016-07-29 23:10:00,3990,West end of the lake with a sustained east wind is a big NOPE for me.
978061,Rizzo,2016-07-29 23:44:00,4754,well that does it...no fishing tomorrow! since I only had 3.5 hours to fish (6-9:30 am) anything further from Guelph is out of the question. Thanks all for your input
978084,dave524,2016-07-30 11:32:00,4508,"West end of the lake with a sustained east wind is a big NOPE for me.  It screws up the fishing even after the waves subside, cause it pushes all the warm water to this end of the lake, fishing is none too good when you are getting 60F temps at 80 feet down."
978085,Rizzo,2016-07-30 12:10:00,4754,"well I guess I could have gone. Current winds are only 10 k. Then again, sleeping in for once isn't so bad either!"
978087,dave524,2016-07-30 12:19:00,4508,"well I guess I could have gone. Current winds are only 10 k. Then again, sleeping in for once isn't so bad either!  Check the radar, not looking good, you made the right decision"
978116,spincast,2016-07-30 22:34:00,3279,"bookmark this one.   http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=45139&unit=E&tz=STN  shows wave height now at 3.9 feet.  no fun, even in a big glass boat. . due east winds, -  west end isnt going to be productive. Good choice to stay home"
978151,fishdawg,2016-07-31 12:34:00,912,You made the right decision Roger. A big salmon tournament out of Toronto was cancelled Saturday. Glad to see you've got the salmon bug!
978157,Rizzo,2016-07-31 15:44:00,4754,"it didn't take much...a lot like when I got that first musky...sold. So close to home, big fighting fish what 's not to like! Not sure i will ever get downriggers but I have 3 dipseys now...one of em gets down 100 feet! I am afraid to see what lives deeper than 100 feet (giant squid?) so dipsey's should be fine"
978234,Freshtrax,2016-08-01 03:23:00,2215,Ok I lied.   Looks like the lake has layer down for tomorow.   We will find out at 6 am.   The fishing unless I'm wrong is going to be tough.
978247,OhioFisherman,2016-08-01 14:21:00,6623,East or north east winds and I stayed off of Lake Erie.
978248,Steve,2016-08-01 14:53:00,2075,crossed the skyway bridge this morning in Hamilton...no boats out and at least four foot waves from the East.
978249,dave524,2016-08-01 14:54:00,4508,"East or north east winds and I stayed off of Lake Erie.  That's an offshore wind for us over this side, usually not bad if close to shore, if you are ten miles out it don't really much matter which direction on Erie. I've had white knuckle days when it kicked up suddenly coming in with the breakers and also coming in against them."
978261,Freshtrax,2016-08-01 18:17:00,2215,"I was out today's from Hamilton , there were about 50 boats off  Bronte, no way those were 4 ft.   2.5 maybe .   Nice day to be out but the water was bathtub warm even a 100 ft down in 225 fow.   Fishing sucked. Nice day for a boatride  though."

978264,Steve,2016-08-01 19:08:00,2075,I could not see boats in front of bronte from the skyway....  was a beauty day on the water this morning none the less...until the traffic picked up that is
978268,Bill Shearer,2016-08-01 19:40:00,456,"From my experience with east winds, I never bothered going out in them. Learned very early the fish aren't interested, the passengers get sick quickly, and it's just a waste of time. Dave had it pegged at post #7!  As soon as there are a couple of days of west winds, things will start improving IMO"
978275,Freshtrax,2016-08-01 19:50:00,2215,"I was under no illusions,  I knew what I was getting into.   Beats painting the kitchen ...that was my other option for today."
978280,Bill Shearer,2016-08-01 20:29:00,456,Then you certainly did the correct thing! Painting sucks a lot more than east winds!
978287,dave524,2016-08-01 21:10:00,4508,Then you certainly did the correct thing! Painting sucks a lot more than east winds!  Brownie points could be useful for when you get a report that the fishing is hot and the wife has other plans.
978292,Freshtrax,2016-08-01 21:45:00,2215,She came for the nice boat ride today.....she actually likes fishing.
978331,OhioFisherman,2016-08-02 12:27:00,6623," That's an offshore wind for us over this side, usually not bad if close to shore, if you are ten miles out it don't really much matter which direction on Erie. I've had white knuckle days when it kicked up suddenly coming in with the breakers and also coming in against them. That was the nice thing about fishing this side of the lake, the change in the prevailing winds. Late spring and summer usually meant south-southwest-west- or southeast winds, for smallies here most of the time I was never more than a mile offshore. I can imagine some days that look good on this side seem a bit risky on the north side!"
