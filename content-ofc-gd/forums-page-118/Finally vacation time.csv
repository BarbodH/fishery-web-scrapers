It's a beautiful island with a rustic cottage and no electricity. It is propane powered with a fridge, hot water tank, stove and gas lighting. This will be the first year we go without our daughters and second year without our boy copper. It will be different to say the least. We will still do the usual, swimming, fishing, camp fires and relaxing but no kids. To say the least I'm not ready to be an empty nester. Oh well, life goes on and I guess wifey and I will be out fishing for these bad boys!! A week of fish, fish, fish......will have lots of reports! (Hopefully lol) "
