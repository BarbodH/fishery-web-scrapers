977877,Tjames09,2016-07-28 07:08:00,664,"What I started with is an old Peterborough 12' aluminum boat, rotted out transom and no motor.    Painted the inside light grey and green. Added new transom on both inside and outside.    Exterior was painted green and dark grey on the bottom    I have bought a motor and trolling motor for it, Ill add more pictures when the entire setup is in the water. "

977885,porkpie,2016-07-28 12:27:00,2521,"Nice looking tinny.  I rebuilt ours at the cottage 2 years ago, but I got lazy and didn't paint it.  It doesn't take much to make an old tin boat like new again!"
